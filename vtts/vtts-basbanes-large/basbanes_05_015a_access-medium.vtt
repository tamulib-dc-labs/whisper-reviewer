WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:05.222
Hey, Tim McCord is on, talking to Whitney Otto.

00:06.003 --> 00:26.038
Your third novel, the first was a spectacular success, and then the second, I hate it when, you know, the expectation for the second is dependent on the first, but how did you see this third one coming into it, you know, after the spectacular success of the movie of the first?

00:26.339 --> 00:40.153
Well, I don't want to judge it, but, you know, I mean, I hate to quote other reviewers, but, you know, it was like they were waiting with their knives, I guess, and you must have felt a little apprehensive, I guess, coming into this.

00:40.714 --> 00:44.217
Well, I was apprehensive because it was my second novel and also the subject matter.

00:44.958 --> 00:46.059
You mean the second or the third?

00:46.119 --> 00:46.720
The second novel.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.180
Okay, yeah.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.064
It was, you know, it was something that seemed

00:51.601 --> 00:56.205
I don't mean controversial in a big way, but seemed open to a lot of discussion.

00:56.986 --> 00:59.128
And when I wrote it, I didn't think that it was.

00:59.208 --> 01:00.209
I thought that everyone knew.

01:00.409 --> 01:04.573
But anyways, and I think also I attempted to write... Everyone knew what?

01:04.593 --> 01:04.953
I'm sorry.

01:05.054 --> 01:08.717
Oh, that women become marginalized or invisible if they age in America.

01:09.498 --> 01:11.840
And I tried to write about it.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.684
I mean, I thought it was an old story that I was going to write about in maybe a slightly different way.

01:17.205 --> 01:18.486
And the reviews on it...

01:19.040 --> 01:22.547
would be like mixed, but then ultimately end negatively.

01:22.627 --> 01:24.731
And it was a different experience.

01:24.751 --> 01:42.043
But in a way, it wasn't a horrible experience because Quilt had, for me, unexpectedly done so well that having my next novel not do as well was kind of a release in a strange way.

01:42.293 --> 01:45.516
And so the third one... Well, a relief in what strange way?

01:45.997 --> 01:54.905
I think because... I say this as an author who's working on a second book right now.

01:54.925 --> 01:58.929
I don't want to go through that.

01:59.610 --> 02:04.475
I think, let's see... I'm teasing, but go ahead.

02:04.875 --> 02:10.320
No, but I think, I mean, it was a relief kind of because I kept thinking, you know, how can I measure up to quills?

02:10.601 --> 02:11.001
And since...

02:11.521 --> 02:16.849
Since it was so surprising to me that it did that well, it wasn't like I wrote a quilt and expected anything to come from it.

02:17.469 --> 02:21.415
And, of course, when things did, I kept thinking, how can I recreate this experience?

02:21.435 --> 02:22.557
But, of course, you can't, you know.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.278
You can't.

02:23.298 --> 02:23.858
Yeah.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.080
The first book is magic.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.743
Exactly, exactly.

02:26.783 --> 02:29.226
And people cut you a lot of slack on the first book, I think.

02:29.662 --> 02:37.350
I know as a critic myself, and particularly first novels, you do cut slack.

02:37.411 --> 02:37.831
You better.

02:37.871 --> 02:38.271
You should.

02:38.452 --> 02:43.617
I think it's incumbent upon you to take a first novel on its own terms as a first novel.

02:44.398 --> 02:58.774
The only problem I have with my work being reviewed is if the review tends to just review the work and say, you know, this isn't for me, or I think this is weak,

02:59.395 --> 03:25.167
you know, this isn't coming across as, I mean that's okay, but sometimes the reviews step over into something more personal, like she thinks she's blah blah blah and I think, well you can't know that about me because you haven't talked to me. You don't know what what I'm doing. When they read more into it and it gets a little personal like. I think actually in my own review or perhaps in Boston who said something about haven't we got past women picking up the coffee or something I thought well since I've been working in offices most of my life

03:25.484 --> 03:32.516
I'm here to say, no, we haven't, but there have been other strides, but that wasn't what my book was about anyways, with, you know, who makes the coffee.

03:32.536 --> 03:44.657
So it was like almost this willful misreading, but I thought, but at the same time, I really respect that people are entitled for their own opinion, and it really doesn't, I mean, I don't have, like, reviews packed on my walls, and I don't have the names of people tattooed on my brain.

03:45.110 --> 03:46.151
It's not that way.

03:46.211 --> 03:46.632
You don't?

03:47.433 --> 03:49.775
No, actually I don't.

03:50.396 --> 03:57.283
For my book, I had wonderful reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post, but you always remember that one line where they zap you, you know?

03:57.784 --> 04:00.487
Yeah, I mean, I can remember it and I can think, wait a minute.

04:00.527 --> 04:01.368
You can quote it even.

04:01.788 --> 04:02.609
I can, you know?

04:02.769 --> 04:03.350
Yeah.

04:03.370 --> 04:03.810
You can't?

04:04.351 --> 04:14.442
No, I mean, I can't remember necessarily where I read it or sometimes, you know, I met one critic in another situation and

04:14.624 --> 04:20.775
I was talking to her, and she was so kind of tentative around me, and I thought, I don't understand.

04:20.835 --> 04:22.919
And then she said, I'm sorry I didn't like your book.

04:23.039 --> 04:24.041
I did or I didn't?

04:24.441 --> 04:25.403
She didn't.

04:25.503 --> 04:30.632
And I thought, oh, well, you know, that's not like the issue for me if it's a fair review.

04:31.694 --> 04:34.359
As long as it's not personal, as long as it's not mocking.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.965
When I was a book review editor, which I did for many years,

04:38.519 --> 04:40.462
I would never publish a walking review.

04:40.583 --> 04:45.852
I mean, if you don't like it, set it out, explain it, but do it respectfully.

04:45.892 --> 04:49.819
I mean, it's not easy to write a book.

04:49.839 --> 04:56.831
And I think sometimes, too, with writers, I mean, people act like they deliberately wrote a book that sort of misses the mark, and you think, actually, I did the best job I could.

04:56.891 --> 04:57.372
Really?

04:57.942 --> 05:00.267
So anyway, we come into this third book.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.171
This is quite an interesting thing.

05:03.755 --> 05:05.198
By the way, you're from Oregon, is that right?

05:05.398 --> 05:07.182
I'm from California, but I live in Oregon.

05:07.282 --> 05:08.565
I've lived there a few years.

05:08.585 --> 05:10.049
Where do you live, in Portland?

05:10.069 --> 05:10.810
Yeah.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.777
Because I write a column, and Eugene is one of my papers.

05:14.137 --> 05:14.498
Oh, really?

05:14.538 --> 05:15.100
Yeah.

05:15.661 --> 05:17.605
I'm in the Register Guard every week.

05:18.310 --> 05:29.861
What I've done basically is I'm in university towns like Eugene and Salt Lake City and Charlottesville, Virginia, and Jackson, Mississippi, about 20 papers, but Columbus, Madison.

05:32.824 --> 05:33.465
University towns.

05:34.005 --> 05:34.286
Oh, yeah.

05:34.306 --> 05:35.847
Well, that was the whole concept here.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.770
I figure, you know, a real brainstorm here.

05:38.850 --> 05:45.596
I wonder where they read books, you know, where they're interested in books other than the usual stuff, you know.

05:45.957 --> 05:46.157
Yeah.

05:46.525 --> 05:47.887
So I've been doing this.

05:48.889 --> 05:55.661
Well, you don't have to know the history of this, but I was interested in the fact that you're here in Oregon.

05:57.644 --> 06:01.952
So anyway, let's talk about the audacity of this third novel.

06:04.436 --> 06:05.158
It's quite a risk.

06:05.278 --> 06:11.689
I've often wondered, all right, fine, you want to write about somebody like Shakespeare or Michelangelo or

06:11.990 --> 06:17.538
You really better have a sense of their character, don't you think, and their creative spirit and their genius.

06:18.059 --> 06:21.584
So tell me a little bit about that aspect of the new novel.

06:22.565 --> 06:28.453
Well, I actually wanted to write about the creative life, and I wanted to write a book about artists.

06:28.794 --> 06:30.015
Well, I wanted to write a love story.

06:30.897 --> 06:31.538
Well, you have both.

06:31.838 --> 06:36.124
Yes, and I wanted to place them and give them creative lives, all the artists.

06:36.644 --> 06:55.127
The kind of artists I think of as quiet or working stiff artists, because so much is always done about the artist who's so outwardly rebellious, who dresses a certain way and does drugs and drinks too much and has too many lovers and no stability and is so mentally out there.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.910
We can only call them genius, and sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.063
but a lot of sort of like acting out.

07:00.764 --> 07:11.178
And I thought about all these other artists who are just as creative, who are just as dedicated and just as sort of consumed by their work, but they turn more inward in a way.

07:11.198 --> 07:20.451
You know, they have quieter lives, like, you know, Joseph Cornell or Rene Magritte or even, you know, Flaubert, who said, you know, your life should be as bourgeois as possible.

07:20.471 --> 07:22.553
Do you want to make art or do you want to write a book?

07:22.573 --> 07:24.656
And so I thought about those people.

07:24.676 --> 07:25.197
And I also...

07:25.649 --> 07:55.437
thought about how whenever you see artists in the movies no matter how destitute they are they have just such a cool place to live you know really nice clothes you know I mean they always seem to have this sort of set life in a sense and I wanted to show how artists actually sometimes have to make a living and you know ways that they do live and so I wanted to address that and I wanted to more than anything create a world that seemed really accessible to someone who wasn't an artist they didn't want um

07:56.075 --> 08:13.031
someone who's not an artist to think, well, why would I be interested in these self-indulgent people or why, you know, there's something about people who are like really flamboyant artists who try and sort of exclude, I don't know, I don't know what you would call, say non-artist.

08:13.631 --> 08:16.294
And I think that's not quite fair.

08:16.334 --> 08:18.096
I don't think the world is that rarefied.

08:18.176 --> 08:21.539
I mean, artists certainly do contribute a lot to society.

08:22.119 --> 08:23.841
They contribute everything to society.

08:23.881 --> 08:24.862
But you know what I mean?

08:24.882 --> 08:25.963
I kind of thought,

08:26.399 --> 08:31.005
Well, if I wrote about like a different story with artists, like the different kind.

08:32.206 --> 08:35.150
I mean, because I find this in my own life sometimes.

08:35.891 --> 08:37.813
If you're broke, you're an artist.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.076
If you drink too much, you're an artist.

08:40.497 --> 08:42.419
If you treat people around you, you know.

08:42.779 --> 08:45.022
Or if you make too much money as an artist, you're a sellout.

08:45.263 --> 08:45.823
Exactly.

08:45.883 --> 08:48.046
You've gone commercial, right?

08:48.066 --> 08:48.266
Right.

08:48.366 --> 08:51.791
As they say, here's to say in the 50s, you're going commercial.

08:52.171 --> 08:55.275
And they forget that at some point you were unknown too.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.024
And you all start from the same point.

08:58.044 --> 09:01.829
It's just that some kind of good fortune or lady luck or something steps in for you.

09:02.490 --> 09:07.237
And as much as I hate to say it, it has to do with what you've produced and it doesn't.

09:07.418 --> 09:08.039
You know what I mean?

09:08.700 --> 09:12.806
So there's a little bit of lack of control to what happens to you.

09:13.066 --> 09:18.394
And I do think sometimes there are people who are very good who don't get their due.

09:18.661 --> 09:36.683
Tell me about, if you might, the idea of spanning the centuries here, really, going from Florence and the Renaissance and zooming ahead 400 years to the early 20th century.

09:37.344 --> 09:45.073
Well, I knew I wanted my artist to go from artist colony to colony, and I had to think of what would the starting point be,

09:45.256 --> 09:56.150
And I thought, well, I know it's a 20th century story, but I just knew that it began thematically and with sort of like the ultimate artist colony of the Western world in the Renaissance.

09:57.011 --> 10:10.569
And also the Renaissance is the first time that in a really, really profound way art, politics, money, and religion all seem to sort of just collide with each other.

10:11.190 --> 10:14.875
And also the humanitarian philosophies and opulence of the era

10:15.175 --> 10:18.439
And it just seemed like a good starting point for an artist colony.

10:18.459 --> 10:21.523
And there were so many artists, you know, for those few hundred years.

10:21.703 --> 10:24.787
So I thought, well, this seems like a good artist colony to begin with.

10:25.628 --> 10:33.719
But I have to say, I was nervous about starting in the Renaissance because I thought, oh, no, people are going to think this is like some kind of, you know, funky historical novel or something.

10:33.739 --> 10:36.182
And I have to say, that occurred to me early on.

10:36.262 --> 10:36.682
Yeah.

10:37.824 --> 10:40.387
And, you know, and I thought... But what kind of fieldwork did you have to do with this?

10:40.427 --> 10:41.348
Did you go to Florence?

10:41.869 --> 10:43.211
Oh, I haven't been to Florence in years.

10:43.791 --> 10:44.212
Mm-hmm.

10:44.232 --> 10:44.372
But...

10:44.639 --> 10:47.288
And when I was in Florence, I had no intention of writing about it.

10:47.508 --> 10:49.354
So it wasn't that I was sort of on the lookout.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.046
And mostly I just, because I'm a fiction writer,

10:54.055 --> 10:58.000
I mind travel a lot, you know, and I think about it, you know.

10:58.020 --> 11:01.004
I've had automobile accidents because I was mind traveling.

11:01.024 --> 11:02.947
Yeah, exactly.

11:02.967 --> 11:07.173
I don't have to operate heavy machinery when I'm doing that.

11:07.193 --> 11:08.354
Because it's going to be pretty bad.

11:09.396 --> 11:13.401
But, you know, so I think, well, I'll just, you know, what would it be like if I were here?

11:13.421 --> 11:14.383
What would it be like if I were there?

11:14.403 --> 11:20.090
And I didn't worry too much about the way the characters spoke because, you know, they would actually be speaking in Italian anyway.

11:20.151 --> 11:21.953
So it wasn't like I had to come up with some kind of weird,

11:22.507 --> 11:25.371
you know, English elocutions or something.

11:25.431 --> 11:32.241
But ambiance is important and to have a sense of, you really have to have a feel for the place, I think.

11:32.882 --> 11:37.609
Yeah, and I think that also human nature has been pretty... Well, that stays the same.

11:38.651 --> 11:38.871
Yeah.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.517
Just read Shakespeare if you want to see human nature that hasn't changed, right?

11:42.537 --> 11:43.358
Exactly.

11:43.919 --> 11:50.809
So I thought if you got the sort of emotional landscape, you know, if it seemed true or correct,

11:51.177 --> 11:58.607
then the reader would just follow you through the rest of it and not worry about exactly what is placed in the room.

11:58.748 --> 12:05.457
You do use this metaphor of passing in a way, passing as a boy, passing as a mulatto.

12:05.817 --> 12:12.246
Were you mindful of this or is that just the way it worked for the novel?

12:13.087 --> 12:16.012
Well, I knew what the Renaissance story was.

12:16.332 --> 12:17.994
That was the first thing I knew about this book.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.678
I had the image of this girl spine on Michelangelo.

12:21.232 --> 12:29.967
But, and then I knew that she was dressed like a boy and I knew it was partly to get, you know, to make this easier, this hiding on the floor and climbing in through the windows.

12:30.388 --> 12:35.497
But then I also realized that it was because she was in love with him and he loved boys.

12:35.557 --> 12:37.821
So she wanted to be a boy.

12:38.402 --> 12:41.147
You talk about a switch, you know, off the moment of discovery.

12:41.868 --> 12:42.570
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

12:42.710 --> 12:46.176
Oh, and then she also wants to be a boy because at that time,

12:46.342 --> 12:49.106
if you wanted a life of art, it was better to be a boy.

12:49.167 --> 12:59.964
I mean, there's a lot of reasons for her wanting to change gender, but I think primary, in a way, she loves him, you know, and I think all that he means to her.

13:01.186 --> 13:07.476
And then I knew I was going to write about the Harlem Renaissance, and I actually kind of wanted the book to end in the Harlem Renaissance, but I couldn't work that out.

13:08.017 --> 13:08.738
So I thought, well,

13:09.005 --> 13:12.130
At whatever point the Harlem Renaissance comes in, I wanted to mirror.

13:12.150 --> 13:20.342
I wanted a girl, again, passing, in this case, an Italian-American woman passing, an African-American woman, and passing as his wife.

13:21.464 --> 13:33.882
And I wanted her in the Renaissance, and I wanted her doing what she does for her own sort of artistic aspirations, but for love of this man who loves her back, unlike me.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.355
the Michelangelo story.

13:36.497 --> 13:41.805
Do you see a constant in your books, a thematic constant in your three books?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.189
I mean, I do, yeah, I think.

13:44.410 --> 13:45.832
Maybe you could articulate it for me.

13:47.154 --> 13:54.687
Well, in Quilt, for me, a lot of that book was about structure and what you could make the structure do, and the stories were kind of secondary.

13:56.329 --> 14:01.017
But thematically, for me, it was about the need to be joined in groups

14:01.638 --> 14:08.509
or marriage, friendship, and the need to be alone and solitary, which I think is the whole push-me-pull-you of the life of the artist.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.093
You need other people, but you really need to be alone.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.857
And then these women get together and they make art.

14:14.258 --> 14:16.501
They make quilts, but they're very beautiful quilts.

14:16.521 --> 14:17.323
I mean, they do make art.

14:17.343 --> 14:22.291
So I think it's got kind of a life of the artist, art theme to it.

14:22.311 --> 14:23.032
But that's only for me.

14:23.052 --> 14:24.895
I wouldn't expect the reader to notice that.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.320
And then in the second book, the book about the woman disappearing,

14:28.604 --> 14:45.265
and, you know, what if no one just notices her, even though ostensibly it's about age and also how we make ourselves disappear, I think on its absolute deepest level for me, it's about what if no one notices your work, what if it's your art that defines you, and nobody cares for your art, you become the invisible artist.

14:45.966 --> 14:49.370
And then the third one is overtly about these themes.

14:49.811 --> 14:54.257
There seems to be a generational concern throughout your work, too.

14:54.277 --> 14:56.940
I mean, there is this...

14:57.764 --> 15:05.111
this awareness, you know, of, I hate to use the word roots, but, you know, what you've inherited.

15:06.492 --> 15:08.614
Is that a fair observation, do you think?

15:09.695 --> 15:12.258
Well, you know, I can't remember the exact Faulkner quote, and you might know it.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.521
What about the past isn't over, it's not even past.

15:16.802 --> 15:23.008
Yeah, that's what I think about when I write, is that... I like that quote, I don't care what I call it, but... Yeah, you know what I mean.

15:23.168 --> 15:23.909
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

15:23.929 --> 15:27.012
I'm a great Faulkner fan, too, and it's funny that one doesn't come to...

15:27.447 --> 15:28.629
history is always with us.

15:28.669 --> 15:30.673
You know, there's no such thing as history in a sense.

15:30.773 --> 15:49.986
And I feel that way in all my books, too, that you're never that far from what happened before, which is why you can write about, or I can write about, I feel, I hope, you know, the Renaissance and the 19th century and the 20th century, because it's not even passed.

15:50.426 --> 15:50.787
Oh, that's a fake.

15:50.807 --> 15:51.689
It's a close change.

15:52.810 --> 15:53.151
Yeah.

15:53.570 --> 15:58.536
Jane didn't really, I have really no biographical background on you, which is really unusual.

15:58.716 --> 16:01.760
I did a search of the Internet, and of course I couldn't find any of them.

16:03.242 --> 16:07.927
But could you just tell me a little bit about yourself writing, been a biographical background?

16:08.328 --> 16:10.451
You said you're from California, for instance.

16:12.573 --> 16:15.377
When your first book was published, what, 91, I think that was, right?

16:15.717 --> 16:15.797
Yes.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.829
Could you tell me how old you are?

16:17.849 --> 16:22.173
I usually use the age if that doesn't bother you at all.

16:22.473 --> 16:24.094
No, because it doesn't change anything.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.035
It doesn't change.

16:25.976 --> 16:27.097
I'm 42 now.

16:27.818 --> 16:30.260
I sold quilt right before my 35th birthday.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.341
That's great.

16:32.222 --> 16:35.625
But I wrote this story called How to Make an American Quilt in the summer of 1988.

16:36.766 --> 16:40.910
And I was sort of midway through this graduate writing program at UCI.

16:42.311 --> 16:43.792
UCI, what's that, Irvine?

16:43.812 --> 16:44.473
Irvine, yeah.

16:45.174 --> 16:45.514
And...

16:46.237 --> 16:49.343
I wrote that story really as an exercise for myself.

16:49.784 --> 16:53.792
And my stories always had sort of like a collage or a fractured narrative.

16:54.473 --> 16:59.804
And so I suddenly found myself writing about, you know, these women who quilt, and it looked like a quilt.

16:59.824 --> 17:03.591
And, you know, the theme of the quilt or the metaphor of the quilt seemed to work really well.

17:03.892 --> 17:08.481
And since I don't sew or quilt, I never met any quilters, never lived in a small town.

17:08.663 --> 17:09.644
They aren't my grandmothers.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.246
I mean, I just made the whole thing up.

17:11.347 --> 17:13.049
It's a wonderful metaphor, though.

17:13.069 --> 17:13.790
Yeah, isn't it?

17:13.810 --> 17:14.270
Yeah, it really is.

17:14.331 --> 17:16.353
Because you're, like, yanking it apart and putting it together.

17:16.373 --> 17:16.854
Oh, sure.

17:16.894 --> 17:18.516
But it can be a group activity.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.178
It can be an artistic activity.

17:21.500 --> 17:21.600
Yeah.

17:21.620 --> 17:22.441
It can be a blanket on a bed.

17:22.461 --> 17:22.862
That's right.

17:22.922 --> 17:26.787
But, I mean, it's individual, and yet it's collective.

17:26.847 --> 17:29.170
I mean, it's got a lot of possibilities there, you know?

17:29.471 --> 17:30.212
Yeah.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.014
And so it was just really interesting to me.

17:32.034 --> 17:34.998
When I wrote the short story, I just, you know, put it down.

17:35.018 --> 17:37.101
I wasn't going to give it to my teacher because I thought...

17:37.486 --> 17:44.517
He'd see something that had quilts in it and think, well, you know, who wants to read about quilts or quilters or anything?

17:44.577 --> 17:50.627
But my teacher actually ended up calling me up and asked if I'd been writing over the summer.

17:51.348 --> 17:53.331
And this is all I had, so I gave it to him.

17:53.411 --> 17:54.493
And he just loved it.

17:54.553 --> 17:57.918
I mean, he just thought that it was just this really wonderful story.

17:58.238 --> 17:59.460
And he saw what I saw in it.

17:59.480 --> 18:05.029
And he didn't see anything like, you know, warm and fuzzy and heartfelt or whatever some people see in it.

18:05.532 --> 18:08.876
He got the structure part of it, what I was trying to do that way.

18:09.197 --> 18:13.822
And anyways, I ended up turning it into a novel in the fall of 1989.

18:13.862 --> 18:16.846
I sent it to an agent in early 1990.

18:18.188 --> 18:20.411
She took me on as a client.

18:20.491 --> 18:21.532
My editor bought it.

18:22.233 --> 18:22.914
Who was the agent?

18:23.174 --> 18:24.636
My agent is Joy Harris.

18:24.656 --> 18:26.158
Yeah, I don't know her.

18:26.178 --> 18:26.739
Do you still have her?

18:27.179 --> 18:28.701
Oh, God, I'm at her house.

18:28.721 --> 18:30.744
I love her.

18:30.764 --> 18:31.324
She's the best.

18:31.344 --> 18:31.945
Yeah, great.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.566
Joy, J-O-Y?

18:34.388 --> 18:34.568
J-O-Y.

18:34.829 --> 18:35.209
Harris?

18:35.610 --> 18:35.951
Harris.

18:36.492 --> 18:37.553
Okay, good.

18:37.573 --> 18:38.114
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

18:38.435 --> 18:43.965
And then my editor is Diane Reverend, and I've been with her all three books now.

18:44.145 --> 18:46.970
Now, the first book was Knopf, is that right?

18:47.030 --> 18:48.332
No, it was Villard.

18:48.352 --> 18:49.655
Villard, okay, which is Random House.

18:49.675 --> 18:51.558
The first book was Villard, and this one is HarperCollins.

18:51.578 --> 18:52.680
Okay, so you went with her?

18:53.020 --> 18:53.261
Yeah.

18:53.882 --> 18:53.982
Yeah.

18:54.002 --> 18:54.523
I mean, she's...

18:55.448 --> 18:57.110
She's so great for me.

18:57.451 --> 19:04.361
I mean, I know that editors are sort of personal to each writer in a way, and I've been really lucky to keep the same editor for all three books.

19:05.603 --> 19:13.135
But between those two women, professionally, I've just, you know, I hate, I mean, I've been blessed.

19:13.155 --> 19:14.737
I don't know how else to say it.

19:15.959 --> 19:16.760
No, I know the feeling.

19:18.823 --> 19:19.364
Let's see.

19:20.546 --> 19:22.048
Do you have a sense of your reader?

19:22.068 --> 19:22.148
Yes.

19:23.427 --> 19:24.448
No, not really.

19:24.628 --> 19:34.019
I mean, it's very funny because I know that for the first book there were a lot of quilters that read this, and I had no idea there were so many.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.142
I thought there were maybe 15 in the whole country.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.925
I didn't know because I knew nothing about quilting, you know.

19:38.985 --> 19:44.671
I mean, I did a little bit of research for my book, but I wasn't really knowledgeable, and it's just enormous subculture.

19:45.252 --> 19:53.181
And so I have a lot of quilter readers, and they seem to be of, you know, they run a gamut of ages, which was the other thing that was unexpected.

19:53.482 --> 20:04.703
And then also, there seem to be a lot of people in, a lot of teachers, high school and college, that really like this book and that ended up bringing it into the classroom.

20:05.645 --> 20:09.732
But I don't know if people who are college age or high school age would have picked up this book otherwise.

20:10.013 --> 20:13.179
You don't see it as a gender type of an audience, though?

20:14.261 --> 20:16.705
I don't, because I feel that I don't...

20:17.765 --> 20:21.411
I mean, you certainly do develop women's issues.

20:21.812 --> 20:23.555
Yeah, yeah, I do.

20:25.137 --> 20:29.845
But you can't be described as a hardliner or a radical either, you know, I don't think.

20:29.865 --> 20:35.014
No, I mean, I'm a feminist, but my definition, and I've been one since I was 17, but my definition has always been

20:35.534 --> 20:40.081
But I think every contemporary woman is a feminist, basically, I would think.

20:40.141 --> 20:40.682
Go ahead.

20:40.702 --> 20:40.942
I'm sorry.

20:40.962 --> 20:42.024
Well, not a lot of the younger ones.

20:42.304 --> 20:48.934
I mean, I taught college for a little while, and there's something very strange that goes on with women who are behind me.

20:49.195 --> 20:53.822
And my definition of feminism has always been, I just want equal opportunity.

20:53.862 --> 20:55.204
Let me rise or fail on my own.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.105
Don't hold me down.

20:56.125 --> 20:56.987
Don't stand in my way.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.671
But I don't expect to succeed just because I'm a woman.

20:59.711 --> 21:00.232
You know what I mean?

21:00.852 --> 21:01.714
And that's it.

21:02.014 --> 21:03.637
That's my sole feminist stance.

21:03.737 --> 21:03.837
Okay.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.134
And because it's the heart of economics.

21:06.154 --> 21:08.077
But don't hold me back because I'm a woman either.

21:08.478 --> 21:08.958
Exactly.

21:09.299 --> 21:12.964
Which is at the center of certainly this book.

21:13.165 --> 21:14.968
Go ahead.

21:15.068 --> 21:15.629
I'm sorry.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.812
So I just feel that way about it.

21:18.914 --> 21:20.917
But I know that I'm often called a woman's writer.

21:21.437 --> 21:27.427
And I don't mind being called a woman's writer as long as I'm not being subtly dismissed in the middle of it.

21:27.467 --> 21:32.254
Or as long as I used to say, I'm not told I can throw a ball good for a girl.

21:32.572 --> 21:35.936
I mean, because we don't a lot of times call male writers male writers.

21:36.317 --> 21:37.218
They're American writers.

21:37.258 --> 21:38.620
I'd rather be an American writer.

21:39.180 --> 21:43.526
But not because I'm ashamed of writing about women or being associated with them.

21:44.147 --> 21:46.189
It's just, like I said, I don't want to be dismissed.

21:46.209 --> 21:49.153
Now, are you familiar with the books of Elizabeth Berg, for instance?

21:49.353 --> 21:51.937
You know, she's a random house writer.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.261
I did a profile of her for Publishers Weekly a couple years ago.

21:55.461 --> 21:59.266
And she's tremendously popular among women.

21:59.326 --> 22:02.410
But you can see her books are quite definitely...

22:02.997 --> 22:06.441
why they would appeal to women and they wouldn't appeal to men.

22:09.324 --> 22:12.708
I think I have a greater, probably a greater appeal for women.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.412
But I think more women read novels than men do anyway.

22:16.512 --> 22:17.533
Yeah, statistically.

22:17.633 --> 22:20.156
They're much stronger readers, I find.

22:20.196 --> 22:27.364
That's the nature of the piece, so to speak, is that women are reading more than men.

22:28.085 --> 22:28.725
But anyway, go ahead.

22:28.765 --> 22:29.226
I'm sorry.

22:29.246 --> 22:30.868
I keep interrupting you here.

22:30.888 --> 22:32.970
Yeah, I think that that's true.

22:33.912 --> 22:47.730
But one thing that was nice when Quilt came out, even though it was seen as a novel that focuses on women's stories, people were also nice enough, I guess, to say it wasn't a male-bashing book.

22:48.010 --> 22:52.917
It wasn't like the men were villains or responsible for everything terrible that happened in these women's lives.

22:53.217 --> 22:55.340
And it's true, the men are just on the periphery of Quilt.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.882
They're not villainous.

22:57.883 --> 23:01.388
There's not wife-beating or any kind of...

23:02.363 --> 23:07.309
I think the worst you can say about the men I write about, and this is true of my second book, too, is that they're just flawed.

23:07.389 --> 23:08.430
But, you know, we're all flawed.

23:08.510 --> 23:14.657
And maybe sometimes they're a little weak, but it's not like I really take off after them in a way.

23:15.217 --> 23:28.152
And I think that, you know, I think good books, of which I hope mine are, don't, you know, tend to have these black and white characters, regardless of what gender you're writing about.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.584
But I do have more male readers now.

23:30.604 --> 23:32.587
With each book, I seem to get more male readers.

23:33.148 --> 23:38.518
And I think also the movie of Quilt helped to get me readers of different ages.

23:38.679 --> 23:44.269
How did the first book do in terms of numbers?

23:45.371 --> 23:47.996
I can only tell you what I read.

23:48.016 --> 23:49.819
I've read that

23:50.491 --> 23:54.875
Quilts sold, I think, I mean like well over a million copies.

23:54.895 --> 23:54.975
Wow.

23:55.175 --> 23:55.516
I know.

23:55.616 --> 23:57.738
It's not unbelievable, but I read that.

23:58.178 --> 24:00.300
We're talking paperback and hardcover, of course.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.821
Yeah, of course, yeah.

24:02.121 --> 24:03.303
How did the hardcover do?

24:03.323 --> 24:04.083
Do you know offhand?

24:04.784 --> 24:11.390
God, the hardcover might have done, and again, I've read this, so anywhere from 55 to 65,000.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.611
That's great.

24:12.791 --> 24:13.772
I don't really know which.

24:15.634 --> 24:16.595
Wow, that's great.

24:17.295 --> 24:19.317
And what's the first printing of this book, do you know?

24:19.972 --> 24:20.653
That I don't know.

24:21.093 --> 24:21.533
It's funny.

24:22.835 --> 24:28.000
Everyone laughs at me, but I ask almost no questions of the publishers because I'm too scared to know the answers.

24:28.360 --> 24:37.148
So I only know about that kind of thing if I read about it or someone says, and by the way, Whitney.

24:37.228 --> 24:41.933
And I assume you're working on a new novel now?

24:42.673 --> 24:47.498
Well, I started something over a year ago, and I don't know if I'll stick with it.

24:48.237 --> 24:55.608
So I'm not working on anything new quite yet because, well, I'm not home, but I always take sort of a little break afterwards.

24:56.189 --> 24:56.329
Good.

24:56.510 --> 24:58.192
Well, plus you have to work with this one.

24:58.933 --> 25:02.038
This one will make requirements of you for sure.

25:02.419 --> 25:02.819
Yeah.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.185
Publicity and readings and all that stuff.

25:06.445 --> 25:09.410
But I'm very happy with the way this one turned out.

25:09.470 --> 25:11.793
I don't know.

25:12.014 --> 25:12.895
This one...

25:13.870 --> 25:18.797
In each book I try and say what I want to say, but sometimes it comes out right and sometimes I'm not sure.

25:19.098 --> 25:26.088
And in this book I feel like, you know, I had that lucky writer moment of, you know, writing the book I really wanted to write.

25:26.148 --> 25:26.369
Yeah.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.413
You're still waiting for the big reviews, I assume.

25:29.433 --> 25:30.034
Is that right?

25:30.074 --> 25:31.917
Yes, I haven't gotten any yet.

25:32.638 --> 25:41.111
I did a search of the Internet looking for them, and the PW was wonderful, you know, the nice starred review there.

25:41.131 --> 25:41.852
That was nice, yeah.

25:42.102 --> 25:45.615
There's one out in Seattle, I guess.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.544
The whole reviewer, I love the way she gets more attention than I did.

25:50.584 --> 25:55.209
I've never seen that in a review before, where the reviewer actually complains.

25:55.229 --> 25:57.311
It's amazing.

25:57.331 --> 25:57.511
Complain?

25:57.931 --> 26:04.618
Well, I didn't complain, but you were talking about your first book, and how it got more attention in this newspaper than her book did.

26:04.638 --> 26:05.639
Oh, yeah.

26:05.679 --> 26:10.443
I've never seen that before, that somebody would actually say that in a review.

26:10.463 --> 26:14.387
One thing I did like about the review was she was very candid about

26:14.789 --> 26:15.935
You know, liking the first one.

26:15.955 --> 26:17.422
Yeah, not liking the first one.

26:17.442 --> 26:18.246
So that's right, yeah.

26:18.547 --> 26:21.080
But that's one of those cases where that didn't bother me at all.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.753
You know, I felt like, okay, you know, that's fair.

26:24.323 --> 26:28.771
Well, the expectation, when you have a real hit the first time around, it must be tough.

26:29.672 --> 26:32.477
Imagine Joe Heller, Catch-22, first book out.

26:32.938 --> 26:34.300
Oh, God, that's like the ultimate.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.265
Yeah, but his whole life has been affected by that.

26:37.305 --> 26:41.112
Every book he does is compared to that.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.476
Robert Penn Warren, you know, All the King's Men.

26:44.197 --> 26:47.142
How do you follow that up with a novel, you know?

26:47.712 --> 26:48.954
I know.

26:48.974 --> 26:49.635
It's very hard.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.680
I think you're best off being like Harper Lee and just letting it all go.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.762
She quit right there.

26:54.042 --> 26:54.303
Yeah.

26:54.884 --> 26:59.671
Where George Higgins, you know, he wrote The Friends of Eddie Coyle in about 40 or 50 books since then.

27:00.212 --> 27:01.454
But name one of them, you know.

27:02.075 --> 27:06.602
They're always comparing the subsequent books to that first one.

27:06.683 --> 27:11.851
But, hey, you know, I wouldn't mind having in my obituary author of Catch-22, right?

27:11.871 --> 27:13.494
Oh, I know.

27:13.874 --> 27:15.036
I could live with that.

27:15.016 --> 27:15.537
I know.

27:15.557 --> 27:23.348
I think it's just funny because I think, you know, you just keep raising the bar for yourself with, you know, each time or something, but you forget how high you placed and how lucky you are.

27:23.389 --> 27:23.989
That's right.

27:24.009 --> 27:24.871
Well, that's a good quote.

27:25.011 --> 27:25.952
That's an excellent quote.

27:26.193 --> 27:27.274
And I think we can quit on that.

27:27.475 --> 27:27.755
Okay.

27:28.716 --> 27:29.277
So good luck.

27:29.638 --> 27:29.958
Okay.

27:30.038 --> 27:30.860
And thank you so much.

27:30.900 --> 27:31.881
Nice talking to you.

27:31.961 --> 27:32.542
Nice talking to you.

27:32.562 --> 27:32.763
Okay.

27:32.883 --> 27:33.203
Bye-bye.

27:33.504 --> 27:33.784
Bye.
