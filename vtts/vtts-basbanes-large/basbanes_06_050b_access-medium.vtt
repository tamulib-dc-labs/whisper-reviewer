WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.198
Okay.

00:03.218 --> 00:03.939
What's productive?

00:04.180 --> 00:12.513
Well, one of the reasons why there's so much gossip in the field is because it is small, it is coherent, and it is a community of interest.

00:12.533 --> 00:17.280
People share one another's enthusiasm, if not their passions always.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.502
And it does involve passions.

00:18.702 --> 00:29.599
And it does involve, and sometimes, not always, but no matter, you know, whatever the level of emotional involvement, there's enough shared interest that it does generate a lot.

00:30.575 --> 00:33.600
two things and then we can start thinking of wrapping up.

00:33.620 --> 00:37.626
I know you've just given me a very generous lazy day today.

00:37.646 --> 00:46.840
Um, tell me about your, now you work at the, you're involved at the Grolier Club for the exhibit of Manny's stuff.

00:46.860 --> 00:47.721
Yeah.

00:47.742 --> 00:48.723
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:49.845 --> 00:57.797
Well, I'm on the council of the Grolier Club and as a member of the council, I was asked to chair the committee on small exhibitions and

00:58.148 --> 01:02.434
So we organized through the committee three or four exhibitions a year.

01:02.675 --> 01:03.235
Question?

01:03.255 --> 01:04.297
Interrupt with a question?

01:04.918 --> 01:05.799
Sure.

01:05.819 --> 01:10.145
Did you people approach Manny, or did Manny suggest it to you?

01:11.187 --> 01:15.213
Well, we had a meeting, and we discussed a number of ideas.

01:15.393 --> 01:19.459
One of the members of the committee was a bookseller named Jim Cummins.

01:19.479 --> 01:23.945
Jim was the principal agent, Dick Manny.

01:23.965 --> 01:25.267
Yeah, and Dick's name came up.

01:25.327 --> 01:25.928
I don't know that

01:26.279 --> 01:27.761
Jim suggested it.

01:27.781 --> 01:30.685
I think maybe he didn't.

01:30.705 --> 01:35.632
But he certainly was willing to assist in terms of... And I know Jim is a very nice man.

01:35.652 --> 01:37.594
He's a fine person.

01:37.614 --> 01:39.997
And he volunteered his assistance.

01:40.018 --> 01:45.785
And I think this was in March of the year before Dick put his exhibition on.

01:45.885 --> 01:52.715
So I really think that the origins of this were in good faith.

01:52.735 --> 01:55.999
However, by the time the exhibition was put on, Manny...

01:56.266 --> 02:00.091
himself if Jim didn't know.

02:00.111 --> 02:02.053
Manny knew if Jim didn't.

02:02.574 --> 02:07.380
And then, as I said at lunch, Peter Krause came along and said, oh, what a great idea for a small dinner.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.982
I'll ask Dick to come.

02:09.002 --> 02:13.388
Dick went and evidently acted as something of the nature of a shill.

02:14.269 --> 02:15.070
Were you at the dinner?

02:15.090 --> 02:16.992
No, I was not at the dinner.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.434
And I didn't hear about this right away.

02:18.454 --> 02:20.637
And then, actually, what happened was that

02:20.819 --> 02:25.525
A number of people then telephoned me subsequent to it and said, you know, there was a terrible thing that happened.

02:25.546 --> 02:30.232
And I didn't, up until that time, I didn't even know that Dick's collection was to fail.

02:31.354 --> 02:37.422
So I felt mortified because I felt like I'd been put in a compromising position, even though I knew better.

02:37.522 --> 02:39.264
But no one else would know that.

02:39.445 --> 02:41.407
And it made us look very bad, I thought.

02:41.427 --> 02:46.835
The other thing about it was there were people at the dinner who were really offended by his behavior, stood up and told him.

02:46.855 --> 02:49.138
And I had dinner or a lunch with Ken Loft, and

02:49.355 --> 02:51.157
This might embarrass Ken.

02:52.959 --> 02:53.759
Ken told me that.

02:55.541 --> 03:00.106
I think it was Elizabeth Lyley who really means him from one end of the room to the other.

03:00.126 --> 03:01.848
But that's what I'm told anyway.

03:01.868 --> 03:02.588
There's another woman.

03:02.889 --> 03:06.813
And another woman might have... I wonder if it was Betsy Shirley?

03:07.053 --> 03:08.554
Could it have been Betsy?

03:08.654 --> 03:10.016
I know the name.

03:10.336 --> 03:11.317
Her husband just died.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.221
Oh, Mary Schlosser.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.122
Mary Schlosser.

03:17.013 --> 03:20.117
Mary Schlosser is the, quote, unspeakably blogger.

03:21.459 --> 03:23.382
Mary is a very outspoken woman.

03:23.422 --> 03:24.583
I can imagine her saying that.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.888
Well, whoever, and one of these people turned to Ken Loft.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.710
I didn't hear that from me, by the way.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.936
Because I didn't hear it from her, I heard it from somebody who heard it from her.

03:33.956 --> 03:35.719
But it's in character, certainly.

03:35.759 --> 03:36.520
It certainly is.

03:37.321 --> 03:37.721
Very much.

03:37.741 --> 03:44.050
One of them turned to Ken Loft, who was president of the club and was president that night.

03:45.059 --> 03:54.567
and said, well, Kent, don't you think this is the most vulgar or whatever, you know, insulting behavior and most inappropriate?

03:54.588 --> 03:57.190
I could hear Mary Hyde calling it unclogable behavior.

03:57.290 --> 03:58.311
Was Mary Hyde?

03:58.331 --> 04:00.433
I don't know if she was there.

04:00.453 --> 04:05.117
Anyway, Kent evidently stood up and said, well, everybody knows my opinion on this subject and probably said.

04:05.317 --> 04:10.922
Well, of course, he was just trying to avoid being dragged into the controversy at all.

04:11.342 --> 04:14.205
And his response was to say, well, this is wowing.

04:14.658 --> 04:16.700
This was at the dinner of this house?

04:16.720 --> 04:17.601
At the dinner.

04:17.781 --> 04:18.682
So there was an outbreak?

04:19.002 --> 04:21.344
There was a fight fight.

04:21.924 --> 04:25.768
There was angry accusation recrimination.

04:26.288 --> 04:34.636
But the suggestion made it that it certainly had the appearance of his using the occasion to promote the sale of it.

04:34.656 --> 04:35.636
It's not the exhibition.

04:37.158 --> 04:43.884
Well, the exhibition, well, you couldn't ask for a better showcase of the materials which are going to be sold in three months.

04:43.904 --> 04:44.344
That's what I mean.

04:44.459 --> 04:45.941
That's my point, yeah.

04:46.302 --> 04:56.418
That the dinner and the exhibition taken collectively could be seen as a kind of... And I knew that that was not the committee's... And almost as a sample of endorsement from the... Right.

04:56.638 --> 04:59.002
Exactly.

04:59.402 --> 05:00.804
And how do I feel?

05:01.205 --> 05:02.187
How do you feel?

05:02.427 --> 05:08.256
I felt terrible about it because I thought that... I've asked Manny about this to come.

05:08.843 --> 05:10.345
And what did he say?

05:10.365 --> 05:22.543
Oh, it was all in good faith, and it was all honest, and when the thing was set up, the business was still good, and it was a pure coincidence, but I had not at that point heard about the comments at the dinner.

05:22.704 --> 05:27.952
Well, what should have happened, so I think he was giving me a selective thing.

05:28.272 --> 05:38.327
And he should have called me, and he should have said, look, he didn't have to tell me why, I don't care why he spoke this question, but he should have made us aware

05:38.847 --> 05:40.951
of what was going on.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.173
That was his mistake.

05:42.193 --> 05:43.996
He's very selective in what he's telling you.

05:44.116 --> 05:46.019
Well, you know, I mean, people are selective.

05:46.059 --> 05:48.463
He was telling me about his financial problems.

05:48.483 --> 06:00.423
He didn't mention to me that he was too, that, that, that, that voluntary pickers, you know, he would be, as we spoke, not that you would expect him necessarily to volunteer the information either.

06:00.543 --> 06:01.926
Well, I would tell you the truth.

06:01.946 --> 06:02.126
Really?

06:02.146 --> 06:04.450
Because he expects him, he knows the terms

06:04.919 --> 06:09.684
We met him with the understanding that we were talking honestly, and I don't want to be embarrassed.

06:10.025 --> 06:15.071
I would be very embarrassed to write this piece about him and not know about this.

06:15.091 --> 06:24.962
I remember at the opening that I remember thinking to myself, here's a guy who's just absolutely full of himself.

06:25.022 --> 06:29.627
The first person singular just pervaded his conversation in a way that

06:30.198 --> 06:32.381
I felt, you know, I was all put off by it, you know.

06:32.421 --> 06:41.332
Well, I remember now, when I... Oh, I think there are any number of booksellers who were really told.

06:41.352 --> 06:46.899
Peter Howard said, and I'm not talking out of school, because they're quotes I intend to use in the book.

06:46.919 --> 06:57.572
I have no problem saying things that people told me, because I'm using the unspeakable vulgar coin, I'm not attributing it for the individual, because I didn't get it to understand.

06:58.261 --> 07:02.867
Peter Howard says on the one hand, I despise everything a man stands for, on the one hand.

07:03.748 --> 07:09.455
On the other hand, I wouldn't have my million and a half dollar building in Burden if it were for Carter Burden and Dick Manny.

07:11.658 --> 07:17.025
He throws that figure out repeatedly, million and a half dollar building.

07:17.045 --> 07:26.597
Well, the trade, I mean, the great variable, the great

07:27.539 --> 07:52.475
kind of secret is the role of the trade, which I think drives the passion, guides it and forms it, and at the same time lives off of it and stops at the trough of it in a way that is in some ways pretty unlovely.

07:52.996 --> 07:54.238
A lot of what happens

07:54.792 --> 07:59.276
in pursuit of that self-interest.

07:59.356 --> 08:07.884
I think, personally, I haven't met too many, strictly well selected, but I haven't met too many booksellers I trust.

08:07.944 --> 08:10.226
You know who can't stand booksellers?

08:10.486 --> 08:12.208
He's one of them, Larry McWordry.

08:12.929 --> 08:13.029
Yeah.

08:13.049 --> 08:18.053
He wouldn't talk to me because he doesn't want to... He's very funny.

08:18.313 --> 08:22.217
He wants to be written about, but he doesn't want to be... I don't like him.

08:22.315 --> 08:26.700
I had to say to the point where I'm not going to write about him because there are too many other people.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.123
He sent me to Peter Howard.

08:29.223 --> 08:32.988
He was his keynote speaker at an event.

08:33.008 --> 08:35.851
I was involved in Texas a few years ago.

08:36.171 --> 08:38.314
I thought he was a sanctimonious son of a bitch.

08:38.334 --> 08:45.102
Yeah, he said that he was very sanctimonious son of a bitchy thing, at least two weddings that we exchanged.

08:46.844 --> 08:49.487
You want to hear a couple of cute Carter Burden anecdotes?

08:49.990 --> 09:03.049
Well, one of them, I think I started to tell you about the fact that his wife complained to me about walking down the hallway of their apartment and they had to have the books over seven feet and walk into his son's bedroom and there's not a toy in it.

09:03.129 --> 09:04.711
It's all Carter's books.

09:04.751 --> 09:05.612
I mean, they're everywhere.

09:05.652 --> 09:07.034
Well, they were everywhere.

09:07.054 --> 09:09.458
And this is the current wife.

09:09.638 --> 09:09.939
Susan.

09:10.159 --> 09:10.940
Okay.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.341
Right.

09:11.461 --> 09:12.022
Not... Amanda.

09:12.042 --> 09:15.186
No, no.

09:15.206 --> 09:15.747
No, this is Susan.

09:15.767 --> 09:15.867
Yeah.

09:15.907 --> 09:19.272
And, well, there's a story that...

09:19.859 --> 09:30.294
Glenn Harwood, I spent one very biblialist night in South Carolina visiting a collector that we were interested in in a different region.

09:30.315 --> 09:33.960
Actually, for the same reason.

09:34.621 --> 09:34.721
Sure.

09:34.741 --> 09:47.520
And Glenn got pretty well into his cuffs, and one of the things he started telling me was the story about how Carter, the young collector, was well within the swall of Maggie Combs, who I'm sure you've heard her idea about.

09:48.513 --> 09:50.755
And his written name came up.

09:52.116 --> 10:00.684
And Gwen, who was a young Cairo himself in the business, was... What was his friend?

10:00.724 --> 10:11.853
Yeah, he had a very kind of Lower East Side background in a lot of different respects.

10:11.914 --> 10:13.815
He's a very smart guy, though.

10:13.835 --> 10:17.018
I mean, he's really... He's a nice guy.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.802
A lot of people don't like him.

10:19.162 --> 10:20.043
I kind of like him.

10:20.063 --> 10:20.825
He can be abrasive.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.709
But so can everybody else.

10:24.851 --> 10:31.420
Anyway, Glenn was supplying Maggie with literary firsts of a fairly specific nature.

10:31.661 --> 10:36.388
And she was always kind of mysterious about the wise and the wise.

10:36.448 --> 10:46.583
And he figured, well, what the hell, he was getting some good business out of it, even if she was paying him a pretty small mock-up fund.

10:47.390 --> 10:49.834
on the books this year.

10:50.395 --> 10:56.825
One day, and then he had a little shot from him down someplace in the lower 30s.

10:57.205 --> 10:58.167
I've never mentioned a shot.

10:58.247 --> 11:03.535
He's uptown now, and he's just in an office someplace, in an office building.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.899
I haven't been to this place.

11:05.919 --> 11:13.050
And one day Carter Burden wandered in, looking as tight and looking very scholarly.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.253
They felt talking and enjoyed one another's

11:15.588 --> 11:17.450
and Carter promised he'd come back.

11:17.531 --> 11:20.214
And Glenn didn't know some Adam at the time.

11:20.234 --> 11:20.875
Bill didn't know him.

11:20.895 --> 11:22.036
He came back a few more times.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.159
And I guess over the course of time, two things happened.

11:24.219 --> 11:25.801
One was that Glenn found out who he was.

11:26.903 --> 11:35.093
And the other thing was that they both realized, almost at the same moment, that they were being thoroughly manipulated by Maggie Combs.

11:36.415 --> 11:43.384
And at that point, Carter, of course, shifted his loyalty to Glenn, to the enduring

11:44.191 --> 11:49.718
Irritation, if not enmity of Maggie Cohen, who never did quite forget Glenn.

11:49.738 --> 11:55.885
I understand that she actually considered Father Sue against Carter because she won her money.

11:56.065 --> 11:56.646
Did you know that?

11:56.926 --> 11:58.168
No, I hadn't.

11:59.570 --> 12:00.270
Off the record.

12:00.370 --> 12:01.792
That is absolutely awful.

12:01.812 --> 12:08.220
Well, also, I mean, I'll throw you off the record that Carter has an absolutely terrible reputation for two things.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.962
One is treatment for two.
