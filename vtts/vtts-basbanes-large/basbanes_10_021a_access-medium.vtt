00:05.077 --> 00:13.830
I think some people are, like the Supreme Court, they're a little bit leery of this.

00:14.712 --> 00:25.187
I remember years ago, we were invited to lunch at Queen's College Library by Monday, and it was quite an experience.

00:26.429 --> 00:32.839
We were actually weren't just looking for books of paper and eating corn.

00:33.275 --> 00:38.282
And he was more interested in eating prawns than looking for books.

00:39.083 --> 00:45.192
So finally, after a happy session, we let them try to find books and pay them.

00:45.252 --> 00:47.996
It was not so easy, but we found them.

00:48.116 --> 00:52.943
Also, you're going to be very interested in the flow of books from Europe to here.

00:52.963 --> 00:55.968
And of course, you were very active in this immediately after the war.

00:56.068 --> 00:56.929
Oh, the old days.

00:57.289 --> 01:00.514
But we started at a halcyon time for that.

01:00.983 --> 01:03.445
Libraries were greedy for books.

01:03.465 --> 01:08.370
The war had prevented them from buying to a great extent.

01:08.430 --> 01:11.533
And we were able to fill a lot of empty shelves.

01:11.553 --> 01:12.734
Yes, at institutions.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.216
Institutions?

01:14.236 --> 01:15.677
I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:16.118 --> 01:20.702
I remember one visit, our first visit to Old Street in Thrall.

01:21.783 --> 01:27.729
We bought, within two days, a hundred and sixty books.

01:27.869 --> 01:29.611
Largely, the one inside.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.872
This included

01:31.325 --> 01:37.833
the first illustrators of Sari and The Life of Michael Allen.

01:37.853 --> 01:46.905
I mean, today, even to find these books, and if you did find them, we couldn't afford them.

01:47.826 --> 01:49.849
They're so inflated.

01:49.869 --> 01:53.634
I mean, European prices are insane.

01:53.654 --> 01:55.436
Today?

01:55.456 --> 01:55.757
Absolutely.

01:55.777 --> 01:58.480
Aquarius has lost its mind.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.823
I mean, we've always bought some quality.

02:01.843 --> 02:03.325
You can't buy some quality.

02:03.525 --> 02:04.706
We can't buy it.

02:04.726 --> 02:11.695
They say very, very frankly, they won't even stock a book that they cannot sell for less than $100.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.357
Well, you will.

02:13.937 --> 02:15.920
I'm talking about $1,000.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.842
That's right, but I mean, they won't even take a book.

02:17.942 --> 02:18.843
They won't even buy a book.

02:18.943 --> 02:19.304
I know.

02:20.145 --> 02:23.228
It isn't just snobbery and books.

02:23.248 --> 02:25.211
It's greediness.

02:27.033 --> 02:28.855
I don't know what's wrong with the quality.

02:29.122 --> 02:41.513
Well, in the old days, if a dealer didn't know a book, wasn't familiar with it, didn't know what it was all about, he would underpricate it.

02:41.533 --> 02:44.856
And you really could make a find if you knew about it.

02:44.876 --> 02:49.060
Today, if a dealer doesn't know about a book, he'd underpricate it.

02:49.080 --> 02:53.024
It's astronomical for no reason, except that he doesn't know it.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.166
I love your epilogue, by the way.

02:55.186 --> 02:58.909
That is one of the most moving...

02:59.227 --> 03:00.008
I love it.

03:00.028 --> 03:00.829
He loves the book.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.610
I love the book.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.074
And his wife did too.

03:04.094 --> 03:08.520
My wife and I spent five days in England last week working on this new book.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.485
And we were at Quaritch, incidentally, just a couple of days ago.

03:12.106 --> 03:13.287
And it's lifeless.

03:13.608 --> 03:14.850
It's a lifeless place.

03:15.210 --> 03:19.336
And they are so guarded about everything.

03:19.797 --> 03:20.678
You know, they don't...

03:20.945 --> 03:22.667
They don't want to talk about anything.

03:22.687 --> 03:23.528
They don't want to.

03:23.649 --> 03:25.391
Did you speak to Paul Wilson?

03:25.451 --> 03:29.636
I saw Nicholas, and I saw Arthur Freeman.

03:29.897 --> 03:31.619
Arthur Freeman.

03:31.639 --> 03:33.742
Arthur Freeman is an ex-American.

03:34.062 --> 03:35.284
That's right.

03:35.484 --> 03:40.050
They're exhibiting in our New York Book Fair.

03:40.210 --> 03:41.211
I can't make it.

03:41.231 --> 03:44.576
Maybe that's what I can't get enough light.

03:44.796 --> 03:47.820
Of course, you see the idea that it's an English firm.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.382
It's going to distract

03:49.902 --> 03:52.364
Well, X is not going to buy from you.

03:52.685 --> 04:01.453
He would rather buy from an English term or a foreign term, I think, psychology and so forth.

04:01.473 --> 04:04.976
But it's not.

04:05.877 --> 04:08.500
Well, why is it so lifeless, it's quality?

04:08.900 --> 04:13.204
I think it's just the attitude that you're both describing right now.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.846
It's a big business.

04:14.886 --> 04:18.289
There was a whole library there, for instance,

04:19.484 --> 04:24.011
on consignment on Middle Eastern, it's a Middle Eastern collection.

04:24.471 --> 04:26.034
That's where they take money.

04:26.054 --> 04:26.635
That's right.

04:26.715 --> 04:28.558
That's where they make money.

04:28.578 --> 04:33.305
It must be, I would estimate, maybe eight or nine or 10,000 books.

04:33.325 --> 04:35.748
A huge number of books, because it just fills the downstairs.

04:36.490 --> 04:41.096
And I said, wow, whose library they wouldn't say.

04:41.397 --> 04:43.180
I said, are you going to catalog it?

04:43.280 --> 04:46.865
No, they're trying to find an en bloc purchaser.

04:46.885 --> 04:48.107
They're going to be pages.

04:48.256 --> 04:49.317
Without catwalk.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.941
So we'll never know who owned it and who's going to buy it.

04:51.961 --> 04:53.022
It'll go back to the east.

04:53.303 --> 04:54.424
I would think so.

04:55.646 --> 04:56.707
But they were young men.

04:56.727 --> 05:01.073
That's where their big money is, the sheeps and all those people.

05:01.313 --> 05:03.216
I've been speaking in libraries.

05:03.356 --> 05:15.192
I remember we visited Francis Edwards one year, and Harris, who was then the head of Rare Books, he said, oh, yeah, let's go down to the basement and have fun.

05:15.391 --> 05:18.555
We just got in the Marquis of Bucke's library.

05:20.398 --> 05:29.610
And here were these marvels, for us, marvels of the complete alphabet of the propaganda.

05:29.630 --> 05:35.538
I can't even begin to tell you what stuff was down there.

05:35.558 --> 05:37.280
They didn't care, made prices.

05:37.441 --> 05:40.184
It was a different attitude.

05:40.805 --> 05:43.068
Perhaps people would wear books and smaller.

05:43.629 --> 05:45.111
Perhaps people would look.

05:45.547 --> 05:51.372
Certainly there were great, great books after Mr. Morgan did not buy a cheap book.

05:52.774 --> 05:57.438
And Huntington and all the great collections were formed before our day.

05:57.878 --> 06:04.685
But I think dealers were, certainly here, they were more relaxed than they are today.

06:04.705 --> 06:09.689
And there was a closer feeling.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.432
There were fewer dealers, but they were close.

06:12.918 --> 06:15.983
They also were closer to their books on the land.

06:16.003 --> 06:18.307
And that anticipates my next question.

06:18.447 --> 06:19.509
You two are scholars.

06:19.989 --> 06:22.293
You really don't see the scholar bookseller.

06:22.313 --> 06:22.894
Well, you do.

06:23.154 --> 06:24.296
I didn't want to say it.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.139
I didn't want to say it.

06:26.199 --> 06:30.546
And that's basically something that I'm developing in this book.

06:30.566 --> 06:35.715
That's one reason for their adoration of modern firsts.

06:35.735 --> 06:37.958
They don't have to know so much.

06:37.978 --> 06:39.060
What about modern firsts?

06:39.479 --> 06:42.643
Well, you have to know that this has dropped J on page 91.

06:43.985 --> 06:54.861
I mean, and what is so terrible is that these kids brag to every fair the same lousy books.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.925
They don't sell it at a fair in Spokane, Illinois.

06:58.325 --> 07:00.428
They try a place in Missouri.

07:01.169 --> 07:04.494
And it's not exciting about their home.

07:05.195 --> 07:06.617
But they know how to charge.

07:07.002 --> 07:17.719
You have a wonderful line at the very end in the epilogue where you're discussing basically this, and you say the problem with young dealers today is that they confuse value with price.

07:18.480 --> 07:18.781
Scholarship.

07:19.222 --> 07:19.462
Scholarship.

07:19.482 --> 07:19.923
Absolutely.

07:19.963 --> 07:22.387
This is going into the new book.

07:22.907 --> 07:24.590
And we're actually doing two books for Hope.

07:24.991 --> 07:26.573
One that will be a companion to this.

07:27.094 --> 07:29.698
And then they also want me to do a book on book collecting, tips.

07:30.399 --> 07:31.221
Something like that.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.082
Value.

07:32.905 --> 07:35.771
Don't ever confuse value with price.

07:36.151 --> 07:42.163
The person, the collector who buys for investment isn't somebody that I'm concerned with.

07:42.183 --> 07:43.245
They are collectors.

07:43.326 --> 07:48.055
They're business people looking for opportunities.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.738
Exactly.

07:49.758 --> 07:54.728
And I think this is something that has been so consistent throughout your careers is that

07:55.113 --> 07:58.177
You're buying for value and you're helping people create collections.

07:58.337 --> 08:03.984
And we're buying to do some detective or to enjoy ourselves in between the buying and the selling.

08:04.004 --> 08:08.249
Let's talk about Holmes and Watson, the detective works.

08:08.269 --> 08:14.758
You say at the very end, the great fun for you, you revel in the joys of scholarship and sleuthing.

08:15.619 --> 08:17.601
And let's talk about it.

08:17.621 --> 08:22.527
Well, like the whole, take the whole thing with the Pilgrim press.

08:22.547 --> 08:23.128
I mean...

08:24.188 --> 08:40.391
You read about that in the book, the way Leona found out about what the Pilgrim Press is all about by studying a catalog she got from her, the guy she was prejudice to, Christo, whom you never had the pleasure of doing.

08:40.411 --> 08:43.315
She never had the joy of making this story.

08:44.196 --> 08:48.222
She found a Robinson catalog, of course.

08:48.382 --> 08:49.504
In Robinson.

08:50.108 --> 08:51.229
Robinson.

08:51.369 --> 09:00.038
He had thrown out this very posh catalog, very posh feeling, and they described a Pilgrim Press book.

09:00.058 --> 09:02.881
And Leona, of course, read it, studied it, ate it up.

09:03.922 --> 09:18.417
If she would ever have such a book, my God, a book printed in secret in Leiden in the early 17th century by our Pilgrim Fathers before they boarded the Mayflower and came over.

09:18.437 --> 09:18.917
Isn't that amazing?

09:19.589 --> 09:23.053
I mean, what would be more wonderful?

09:23.073 --> 09:28.578
It would seem to me that a book like that would be just as important as a based-on book.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.060
It would seem to me.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.463
Well, but we call them American incunables.

09:32.483 --> 09:33.023
That's right.

09:33.203 --> 09:34.565
We call them Americans.

09:34.605 --> 09:35.025
They are.

09:35.045 --> 09:39.190
They're the background of the Pilgrims and of the Mayflower.

09:39.210 --> 09:42.053
And undoubtedly, they should be considered Americana.

09:42.113 --> 09:42.553
Yes.

09:42.573 --> 09:44.375
Well, that's what we do.

09:44.575 --> 09:46.137
That's right.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.527
How many years later?

09:47.707 --> 09:48.648
Five years later?

09:48.688 --> 10:07.235
Well, they only published a total of 20 titles while they were in London, because the English, the English ambassador was asking them all the time, since I recall them, to contrastate these titles, because they were anti-Church of England.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.660
That's why the Polish were... Anti-establishment, sure.

10:11.301 --> 10:15.347
And they published, in 1617,

10:15.918 --> 10:16.919
to 1690.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.362
They sailed in 1620.

10:19.422 --> 10:22.525
They went back to England to sail.

10:22.545 --> 10:26.469
And Marilyn had one book there to show you.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.251
Well, now, wait before that.

10:28.691 --> 10:32.876
Five years after she studied this Robinson catalog.

10:32.956 --> 10:34.618
About three years.

10:34.738 --> 10:36.820
No, whatever.

10:38.342 --> 10:41.645
Leona hasn't gone into business yet.

10:42.506 --> 10:43.447
We're in Maine.

10:43.487 --> 10:45.469
I'm working on

10:46.023 --> 10:48.726
Louisa Orcus, Margaret Fuller, whatever.

10:49.467 --> 10:55.173
And Leona is preparing to go into the rare book business.

10:55.193 --> 10:58.717
And she's reading a catalog from the McLeish Brothers.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.840
They were lovely friends.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.802
And such darling people.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.646
Little Russell Street in London.

11:07.967 --> 11:15.355
And she sees a book that she knows was published by the Pilgrim Fathers in London.

11:16.347 --> 11:17.288
They don't know it.

11:17.869 --> 11:19.592
They don't say anything about it.

11:20.132 --> 11:22.516
It was, what did we say, 3 pounds?

11:22.536 --> 11:24.859
It was 2 pounds.

11:24.999 --> 11:29.987
And Robinson had asked 60 pounds.

11:30.007 --> 11:35.735
In those days, it was like 6,000 pounds today.

11:38.038 --> 11:40.302
So she said, but how am I going to get it?

11:40.582 --> 11:41.984
How am I going to get it?

11:42.144 --> 11:44.768
I'm sure someone in London has grabbed it.

11:45.406 --> 11:47.830
But someone in London hadn't grabbed it.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.592
They didn't know about it.

11:50.473 --> 11:53.438
And we'd tell about it in the book.

11:53.518 --> 11:55.661
We'd send it to the book.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.183
We'd send it to the book.

11:57.644 --> 11:59.427
We'd send it to the book.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.670
We'd send it to the book.

12:01.790 --> 12:02.471
We'd send it to the book.

12:02.491 --> 12:03.232
We'd send it to the book.

12:03.252 --> 12:03.893
We'd send it to the book.

12:03.993 --> 12:07.499
We'd send it to the book.

12:07.539 --> 12:08.800
We'd send it to the book.

12:08.820 --> 12:09.942
We'd send it to the book.

12:09.962 --> 12:10.723
We'd send it to the book.

12:10.743 --> 12:11.484
We'd send it to the book.

12:11.504 --> 12:12.105
We'd send it to the book.

12:12.125 --> 12:13.287
We'd send it to the book.

12:13.908 --> 12:21.375
To make a very long story short, and breathless with excitement, yes, she got the book.

12:21.595 --> 12:22.716
We can't go for it.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.959
She got it about two months later, she got it.

12:25.979 --> 12:32.044
Now, this knowledge that you've developed, that you both have, you actually use to help institutions.

12:32.244 --> 12:43.594
I'm very interested in the formation of libraries and institutions, you see, and the role of the bookseller in this, and then also of going into

12:44.502 --> 12:47.344
what the attitude of universities is for the future.

12:47.364 --> 12:49.867
They're deaccessioning, you know, they're deaccessioning books.

12:50.367 --> 12:56.492
Cornell, which you write about in this book, this new book, I was just up there about two months ago.

12:57.033 --> 13:02.858
They are going to reduce their collections from 6.8 million to 6 million books by the year 2000.

13:03.098 --> 13:04.319
What are they going to do with the books?

13:05.300 --> 13:05.921
Deaccession.

13:05.941 --> 13:13.227
Yeah, and they're scanning books, you know, and it's a terrible, it's a terrible development.

13:14.185 --> 13:19.353
When you began by filling empty shelves, now you see it's terrible.

13:20.194 --> 13:30.930
Well, we sold four collections on Bach, and they were unusual collections, uncommon.

13:31.972 --> 13:39.984
It was uncommon material, and the librarians then had the sense to try to acquire this.

13:40.124 --> 13:43.129
Not that the French Revolution was uncommon,

13:44.898 --> 13:50.765
but our, what was a French track?

13:51.086 --> 13:55.311
A French documentary in the 17th century.

13:55.371 --> 14:10.190
You know, I asked Mrs. Goldschmidt yesterday, as a matter of fact, because you write about this in the book, how you did sell these four collections en bloc, because you really established and developed these themes, and all of a sudden these institutions say, you know, this is a terrific archive.

14:10.210 --> 14:13.875
This can, undoubtedly, they're thinking about how it will support

14:14.497 --> 14:17.481
Scholarship was to support the curriculum, I guess.

14:18.562 --> 14:21.766
I said, did your husband ever sell any collections out of law?

14:21.826 --> 14:22.307
She said, never.

14:22.387 --> 14:26.913
There was one he tried to, that he put together, but nobody knew.

14:26.973 --> 14:30.057
So, that's quite an accomplishment when you think about it.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.642
Well, Lucie, first of all, Lucie spoke for mostly art.

14:33.662 --> 14:36.205
But he did one very interesting job.

14:36.225 --> 14:39.069
I had, in fact, she gave me a copy of that.

14:39.089 --> 14:41.091
Yeah, but he didn't sell that one.

14:41.231 --> 14:44.115
No, he wanted to, and he had to sell it.

14:44.281 --> 14:55.262
There was political theory, and I suppose that would be difficult so much because the level of books, the landmark books that libraries would have.

14:55.282 --> 15:00.932
And it has too many tentacles, too many different fields.

15:01.393 --> 15:06.643
We do sell a great deal of political theory because we think it's very important.

15:06.910 --> 15:08.412
Well, we sell it individually.

15:08.492 --> 15:11.736
We would not attempt to sell a warm water.

15:11.756 --> 15:13.779
It's too broad, really, too.

15:13.799 --> 15:15.541
It's tremendous.

15:16.162 --> 15:22.029
We had one collector bought many volumes, but that's another thing.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.993
But to sell it, I think it would be hard.

15:25.013 --> 15:34.285
Did you ever work with the new universities that were just emerging, not just emerging, but had just been established, you know?

15:34.737 --> 15:38.342
And did they ever come to you and say, gee, we have to develop some collections?

15:38.362 --> 15:45.771
Well, Brigham Young is not a university, but we did work with them to expand their collections very notably.

15:47.553 --> 15:56.344
Well, when we were out of California, I think in 45... Well, that was the University of San Francisco.

15:56.364 --> 15:58.948
You know, it was University of Colorado in L.A.

15:59.408 --> 16:03.073
They gave us the back of the cards, like the police of pride.

16:03.509 --> 16:06.694
Well, we'd skirt around and try to find them.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.298
Well, we found some of them, because they bought them.

16:09.358 --> 16:10.921
They were just developing.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.446
This was UCLA or San Francisco?

16:14.666 --> 16:17.110
UCLA or California.

16:17.591 --> 16:23.340
UCLA and Los Angeles, they were developing then.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.107
I don't know of any other young years.

16:27.267 --> 16:33.733
Well, we started the Altered Collection at BYU, and that is really an important collection today.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.976
And they have great, good holdings.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.780
Now, is this something that they proposed to you, Ed, or that you proposed to them?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.922
Yes, they did propose it.

16:43.262 --> 16:53.132
They knew I was so deeply interested in Altered and had written extensively about her, and they said, we'd like to start a good collection.

16:53.392 --> 16:54.593
And they really developed

16:54.910 --> 17:03.278
You see, they've cut down, as most universities have today, university libraries, not just federal funding.

17:03.298 --> 17:07.983
You can pay your hair out to sell to university libraries today.

17:08.463 --> 17:10.245
I don't know if you've received it.

17:10.265 --> 17:11.566
Oh, I've seen this all over.

17:11.586 --> 17:14.029
Even Texas, for instance.

17:14.129 --> 17:14.970
Oh, Texas, mine.

17:14.990 --> 17:22.677
Texas purchased an Aldean collection, and I think a Medici collection.

17:22.697 --> 17:23.398
I'm not sure.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.590
They don't buy books.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.771
Not from Marty.

17:27.811 --> 17:28.492
They don't buy books.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.836
Well, they had been buying Marty first.

17:31.897 --> 17:34.240
They're not outfields.

17:34.301 --> 17:35.923
They were buying like crazy.

17:35.943 --> 17:42.091
When Lou Feldman was around at Marty's home, they bought everything from that.

17:42.111 --> 17:44.455
The humanities research.

17:44.615 --> 17:48.841
That's just the Yorker manuscripts, and that was done in 1993.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.044
This is their collection.

17:51.184 --> 17:53.908
Their collection as of 1993.

17:54.732 --> 17:59.398
I'll give them a call.

17:59.418 --> 18:02.002
Harold B. Lee Library, right?

18:02.542 --> 18:04.385
Harold B. Lee Library.

18:04.445 --> 18:06.708
Who would you suggest I talk to there?

18:06.928 --> 18:11.695
Well, for this... Scott Duvall now.

18:12.275 --> 18:16.521
Yes, Scott Duvall, D-U-V-A-L-L.

18:16.619 --> 18:19.643
Formally, it was Dean Lawson.

18:19.823 --> 18:20.384
Dean Lawson.

18:20.424 --> 18:22.406
You could still think of Dean Lawson.

18:22.426 --> 18:28.874
Now, Dennis Rowley is also very involved in the orchid collection.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.977
They retired Dean, but he built it up.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.821
R-O-W-L-E-Y.

18:35.301 --> 18:36.262
R-O-W-L-E-Y.

18:36.383 --> 18:40.387
I'll talk to them about them.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.089
No problem.

18:42.190 --> 18:44.392
They're very nice.

18:44.412 --> 18:45.073
And Matty.

18:45.357 --> 19:01.038
gave the tour for the year there, the Louise Reynolds lecture on Alcott a couple of years ago, and they really are developing.

19:01.419 --> 19:04.423
They're cutting down on their other books.

19:04.443 --> 19:13.255
They're buying Alcott, and they have a very fun Huguenot collection, and we've been developing the Huguenot collection.

19:13.775 --> 19:21.442
The tract, the Huguenots tract, parents, was a very important one, and they're very hard to get today.

19:22.502 --> 19:29.829
We had a whole collection of these old long blocks where it would never be used.

19:29.849 --> 19:33.492
This was before Bing and Young came into the picture.

19:33.512 --> 19:36.094
They're wider than the Huguenots.

19:36.154 --> 19:38.636
Now, who is yourself this particular?

19:38.656 --> 19:40.298
Are you interested in religion?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.140
Well, not too well.

19:43.357 --> 19:46.281
is now developing the Huguenot collection.

19:47.223 --> 20:00.483
And they're particularly interested in pamphlet material, because there was fighting warfare between the Huguenots, the Valois, the buildings, the gazes, what was going on, the whole zone.

20:01.405 --> 20:04.610
Religion was politics then, too, you know.

20:05.050 --> 20:08.115
And we put out a whole catalog on the subject.

20:08.602 --> 20:12.507
But a larger board that they would never never use.

20:12.908 --> 20:13.609
It's a tragedy.

20:14.329 --> 20:15.471
That's too bad.

20:15.511 --> 20:16.592
That's too bad.

20:16.653 --> 20:26.445
You're finding a lot of universities now, like Cornell, for instance, if nobody uses a book, or the University of Michigan, they're even debating a book.

20:26.465 --> 20:27.687
We sold them a great deal.

20:27.707 --> 20:28.668
They don't use them.

20:28.688 --> 20:36.178
Well, if a book they say isn't used within five years, they actually discuss whether or not they want to teach.

20:36.817 --> 20:37.478
And it's very terrible.

20:37.558 --> 20:39.821
They should write to that university.

20:39.841 --> 20:42.284
Of course, there'll be loads of different things.

20:42.304 --> 20:44.466
Yeah, and they've got a new building they just opened there.

20:44.486 --> 20:46.809
They would rather have a new building, new staff.

20:47.149 --> 20:49.412
That's right, and they don't even call it a library.

20:49.492 --> 20:52.636
It's a learning resource center because it has computers in it.

20:53.177 --> 20:56.340
No more new libraries at some universities.

20:56.941 --> 20:58.062
I wouldn't be writing about this.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.867
This is a very interesting, disquieting development, I think.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.529
It's very disquieting.

21:03.569 --> 21:05.271
That books, that the physical books,

21:06.044 --> 21:08.627
you know, is being eclipsed in a lot of these places.

21:08.647 --> 21:14.412
And the fact that they don't even probably build in a library, which is the soul of a campus.

21:14.432 --> 21:15.614
I went out to Oberlin.

21:15.634 --> 21:16.494
I gave a talk to him.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.257
Well, see how they demolished the lottery schools?

21:19.537 --> 21:20.098
That's right.

21:20.138 --> 21:20.959
That's absolutely.

21:21.059 --> 21:26.785
Columbia, it's disgraceful that Columbia gave up the lottery schools.

21:26.805 --> 21:27.906
I wonder why that is.

21:27.946 --> 21:31.069
Who should I talk to up there and ask them why they did that?

21:31.089 --> 21:35.173
Well, the other person who should talk about it is Virginia Salinger.

21:35.474 --> 21:37.336
He was the big shot at the library.

21:37.356 --> 21:41.101
And obviously they feel like you don't have to learn how to be a librarian.

21:41.121 --> 21:43.664
Susan Thompson, I don't know where she is.

21:43.684 --> 21:46.927
If you don't have a library, you don't need a librarian.

21:47.308 --> 21:48.289
It disgusts me.

21:48.309 --> 21:50.291
Did they close this after Terry left?

21:50.331 --> 21:56.218
Well, they closed it after, but he knew they were closing it.

21:57.079 --> 21:58.641
Well, he might want to talk about that.

21:58.661 --> 22:00.223
That's why he went to the gym.

22:00.383 --> 22:03.827
I saw him at one of the theaters, and I said, I want to come see you.

22:04.297 --> 22:08.003
He must be quite better at that.

22:08.243 --> 22:13.352
You worked for Weichner, I guess, with Herbert, what was the name of Herbert?

22:13.372 --> 22:14.414
Weichner.

22:14.734 --> 22:15.535
Weichner.

22:15.576 --> 22:18.881
Yes, he was a Viennese refugee.

22:19.983 --> 22:28.998
He was mildly impossible, but he was a great, great bookman.

22:29.018 --> 22:29.899
He knew his books.

22:30.503 --> 22:43.094
and he took crowds who certainly did not have these, was not popular among both people, but passed through his books and loads of these refugees.

22:43.114 --> 22:48.099
They introduced, in this country, a different kind of book.

22:48.119 --> 22:59.329
They introduced a foreign scholarly scientific book, whereas before, you take Lester Parker, he was a prime bookman,

22:59.697 --> 23:02.321
He came for cars in Marathon, a good speeder.

23:02.621 --> 23:05.365
Naturally, it was all American.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.847
But Harper also had his funeral.

23:07.248 --> 23:13.197
Yes, but his, and Miriam Lone did his work, where he did the work on New Canaveral.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.099
I don't know how much Harper knew.

23:15.760 --> 23:26.616
But, I mean, the foreign element, of course they brought over what they knew, and they knew the foreign book.

23:27.811 --> 23:30.374
And they brought it to the book trade.

23:30.574 --> 23:34.559
You know, I'm doing a chapter on this.

23:34.579 --> 23:39.684
I've already reviewed Darnie Rosenfall, you know, the lecture that he gave.

23:39.784 --> 23:45.551
And that's why I'm trying to find, unfortunately, most of these people are gone.

23:46.272 --> 23:50.536
So that's why I was talking to Mrs. Goldschmidt yesterday.

23:50.977 --> 23:54.861
I talked to Mrs. Aukenbacher a couple of weeks ago.

23:55.442 --> 23:56.383
And I'm just trying to

23:56.701 --> 24:02.949
establish what this element, what this bookseller element did to the flow of books.

24:03.910 --> 24:18.187
Well, Reiser came over in 1938, and what he wanted to do, he had published in the end of The File of the Blonde, which was a very fine, biblical journal, articles.

24:18.307 --> 24:21.811
I remember we had one issue on William Morris.

24:22.612 --> 24:24.835
It was a very broad scope.

24:25.523 --> 24:33.991
And he thought he could publish and continue here, but he found it very expensive here to publish fine books and then periodically.

24:34.011 --> 24:37.054
You had actually large capital, which of course he did not.

24:37.795 --> 24:46.323
But he'd gotten books on consignment from mags and from some French firms.

24:46.343 --> 24:51.809
And his catalogue one just was a knockout.

24:52.810 --> 24:54.231
He's a great collector.

24:54.650 --> 25:00.496
I mean, Leslie Rosenwald, you know, Streeter.

25:00.516 --> 25:03.660
All those people were his customers.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.164
And he established himself very quickly.

25:07.184 --> 25:09.686
I came to him before he opened up.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.310
I have been working on my Ph.D.

25:14.111 --> 25:19.197
at Columbia and having a lot of problems, as I've been doing before.

25:20.118 --> 25:24.302
And Dr. Hugo Paulson, who was then head of

25:24.569 --> 25:29.236
manuscript at the American History Division of the New York Public.

25:29.256 --> 25:40.832
He said to me, I went to see him about my dissertation, he said, listen kid, there's some foreign guy who's looking for a professor.

25:41.193 --> 25:44.638
Since you know German very well, I thought he might do.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.522
So I went to see Reich.

25:48.447 --> 25:52.172
Well, he was going to Europe that summer to get more of the material.

25:52.492 --> 25:58.199
He said, come and see me in the fall, which I did, and that was it.

25:59.080 --> 26:03.826
And I worked with him for five years, and it hadn't been for man long.

26:03.846 --> 26:08.772
I probably was working for his.

26:08.932 --> 26:09.733
Still sitting there.

26:09.753 --> 26:12.576
I mean, he paid me next to nothing.

26:12.596 --> 26:17.222
But I knew what I was getting on price, and not that he'll virtually talk me.

26:17.776 --> 26:21.680
But I suppose if you could work, and I had a very good background.

26:22.101 --> 26:25.745
I love where you write, you raided his wastebaskets for that.

26:25.765 --> 26:26.566
I did, I raided it.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.487
I love that line.

26:27.507 --> 26:27.807
Yes.

26:28.708 --> 26:35.796
And he was a tyrant, he was abusive, had a terrible temper.

26:36.297 --> 26:39.941
At the same time, after a while, he calmed down.

26:40.362 --> 26:46.028
When I first worked for him, and if I got there at 9 o'clock, he would say, you're late.

26:48.067 --> 26:54.673
But if I got there later on, and then after mine, he didn't open his mouth, he was becoming American now.

26:54.993 --> 27:05.582
For instance, I did all, I tell him the book, I did all the, I had to go down to the customs house to do the conversion, to get the books through customs.

27:05.602 --> 27:11.447
I knew as much about customs poisons as I did about the poisons.

27:11.468 --> 27:17.753
I had not only had to get them through customs, I had to lug them from Morgan Annex when they were,

27:18.104 --> 27:23.652
released to his office, which was on East 62nd Street.

27:23.672 --> 27:25.855
I remember one very cold day.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.178
I was exhausted.

27:28.939 --> 27:34.527
And, I mean, you didn't take taxis on Herbert's generosity.

27:34.547 --> 27:36.750
You took the subway or the trolley.

27:38.131 --> 27:40.355
And I stopped and got a cup of coffee.

27:40.815 --> 27:44.841
When I got to the office, he said, You had coffee?

27:45.682 --> 27:47.284
I said, Yes, I did.

27:47.720 --> 27:52.907
I mean, he treated you like a servant, like a slave.

27:52.927 --> 27:54.930
He was somewhat inhuman.

27:54.950 --> 27:56.171
No doubt about that.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.773
And it's awful to look at.

27:58.214 --> 28:00.677
But all that had nothing to do with it.

28:00.697 --> 28:02.700
He was a very good person.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.881
You do books inside.

28:03.901 --> 28:06.905
Separate the personality from what you learned and what you learned.

28:07.506 --> 28:12.493
And then part of the advice was to remember that thing.

28:13.835 --> 28:16.478
And you will not find it so simple

28:16.745 --> 28:19.448
wasting your time at that awful stress.

28:20.249 --> 28:27.458
They will not find rare books had headaches, and we know it had headaches.

28:27.478 --> 28:31.182
Tell me, are you reviewing the book for Biblio?

28:31.202 --> 28:36.368
I'm actually going to do a full feature on you and the book.

28:36.589 --> 28:42.696
I propose this to them, and this will be right about June when the book comes out.

28:42.776 --> 28:44.338
So I'm actually writing this right now.

28:45.398 --> 28:52.590
We've been having luncheons with the Barnes & Noble people who are very much interested in the book.

28:52.610 --> 28:53.631
Oh, great.

28:55.895 --> 29:00.763
I think they're going to host this at one or more of their, you know, superstars.

29:00.783 --> 29:01.885
Oh, that's great.

29:01.905 --> 29:02.065
Sign.

29:02.245 --> 29:05.050
Have you talked to Leanne at all about signing it?

29:05.370 --> 29:08.475
They should definitely have to sign the book there.

29:08.716 --> 29:10.679
I'll suggest it to her.

29:10.819 --> 29:12.081
I will, because it's a natural.

29:12.736 --> 29:13.877
Well, they can't sell it.

29:13.898 --> 29:15.179
You mean that the book's there?

29:15.299 --> 29:15.840
Yeah, why not?

29:15.860 --> 29:16.901
It wouldn't be available.

29:19.305 --> 29:20.887
That's right.

29:20.907 --> 29:22.148
Well, they could do it next year.

29:22.489 --> 29:24.171
I mean, I signed for them for a year.

29:24.191 --> 29:25.232
I know you did.

29:25.292 --> 29:26.314
And it did very well.

29:26.674 --> 29:32.862
And what they should do is get themselves a bunch of first editions right now, and they give them five books.

29:33.764 --> 29:37.208
Well, we can't tell the...

29:37.711 --> 29:40.715
Oh, I wouldn't dream, but Nicholas, he would.

29:40.815 --> 29:44.641
I'd be happy to mention it to the end, or Bob Fleck, for instance.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.183
Bob Fleck is the man.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.347
There is a chapter on the ABAA in the book.

29:49.447 --> 29:50.369
Absolutely correct.

29:50.429 --> 29:52.031
He published that previous book.

29:52.051 --> 29:57.018
I just talked to him yesterday as an hour, in fact, because he's publishing the Portsmouth catalog.

29:57.218 --> 30:02.666
And I think I want to do a piece on that down the road, too.

30:02.686 --> 30:05.109
He loves his old books in the world.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.633
But, and he...

30:08.862 --> 30:12.927
In our contract with him, have you seen old books?

30:13.288 --> 30:14.008
Yes, I have.

30:14.028 --> 30:17.413
I'm going to include it in this piece, by the way.

30:17.433 --> 30:23.220
There was a clause giving him an option on our next book of a similar nature.

30:24.662 --> 30:28.847
But we didn't regard this as a book of a similar nature.

30:29.708 --> 30:34.414
I mean, Doubleday really ordered this book from us, you know, requested it.

30:34.883 --> 30:36.046
called us.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.851
We tell the story in the prologue.

30:37.871 --> 30:39.776
That was from the New York Times piece.

30:39.796 --> 30:48.157
The New York Times piece apparently stimulated their interest and they asked us to do a joint autobiography.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.205
Well, only half of the book is really

30:52.265 --> 30:55.389
We're only in business during one half of this book.

30:55.449 --> 30:57.992
The first half is... It's biographical, you know.

30:58.113 --> 31:01.557
Yeah, well, it all is biographical.

31:01.717 --> 31:05.302
So we didn't regard, and I don't know how... He didn't get upset, did he?

31:05.502 --> 31:06.143
He did.

31:06.203 --> 31:06.443
Did he?

31:06.804 --> 31:08.246
He did get upset.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.750
I talked to him yesterday, and I told him he never mentioned a word to me.

31:11.770 --> 31:18.399
Well, I think he's... Because we explained to him, this is not a book about books.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.341
It's a book about us.

31:20.402 --> 31:21.563
Fifty years...

31:21.897 --> 31:22.838
as individuals.

31:23.158 --> 31:23.419
Yes.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.662
More than kids.

31:26.682 --> 31:27.322
Well, I know.

31:27.422 --> 31:29.464
Isn't that something?

31:29.485 --> 31:34.129
Well, it was amazing how well it worked.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.853
And the illustrations will prove that, too.

31:38.413 --> 31:39.374
They're childhood.

31:39.474 --> 31:43.659
I mean, they're pictures of you both as little girls in there.

31:43.679 --> 31:46.421
The pictures, because... Oh, yes.

31:46.441 --> 31:49.204
They're going to have about 36

31:49.522 --> 31:51.444
Oh, I didn't see all of them.

31:51.624 --> 31:54.927
No, because they're not in the events.

31:55.267 --> 31:56.389
They'll be in the book.

31:57.069 --> 32:03.676
I think advanced copies will be available in the middle of May, maybe earlier.

32:03.816 --> 32:09.241
Well, I'm going to write this, like, right away, because this will be fresh.

32:09.341 --> 32:12.264
This will come out in June, the things that I'm writing now.

32:12.364 --> 32:18.870
In fact, I'll be working on this tonight, when I go home tonight, and probably work on it on the weekends and Sunday and Monday.

32:19.728 --> 32:22.953
In fact, I'm going to take a few photographs, if you don't mind, before I go.

32:24.956 --> 32:31.406
Again, I'm not asking you questions that you answer most of the stuff in the book.

32:31.566 --> 32:31.867
Yeah.

32:32.328 --> 32:37.035
So what I'm really looking for is some nice atmospheric quotations that you're giving me right now.

32:37.596 --> 32:42.343
You're mentioning about Reischner and this whole...

32:43.201 --> 32:45.543
this whole group of booksellers who came here.

32:45.603 --> 32:46.784
Now, what did they do?

32:46.844 --> 32:50.467
Did they just introduce an attitude among institutions and collections?

32:50.487 --> 32:56.252
Well, they... Now, in Russia, in Europe, he was in Vienna.

32:56.272 --> 32:57.974
He was not a rare book dealer.

32:58.034 --> 32:59.075
He was a publisher.

33:00.056 --> 33:11.186
But, Ranschfeld, who eventually took over Harper, he was with the firm of Gilchover Ranschfeld.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.887
So, he was a rare book dealer.

33:13.745 --> 33:16.608
Cryer was, I don't know what, I think that he was.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.709
He was a young man.

33:18.049 --> 33:19.010
A young man.

33:19.371 --> 33:20.292
And married what?

33:20.312 --> 33:22.614
And his wife had a lot of money.

33:22.654 --> 33:27.919
And he married, he married the plywood queen of America.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.862
Well, whatever, and she had money, and they put it in the war.

33:30.882 --> 33:32.564
She had that much debt.

33:33.585 --> 33:40.252
And they... You mean the war is why they came, obviously.

33:40.532 --> 33:43.735
Well, they came because they were a Jew.

33:44.069 --> 33:45.771
all of them.

33:45.791 --> 33:52.801
James Johnson, Walter Johnson, his name, before he changed, was Jalowitz.

33:53.722 --> 33:55.624
I don't know what he had done before.

33:55.845 --> 33:58.468
They had all been connected with books.

33:58.488 --> 34:08.001
And Reisner was one of the earliest to come, and they all came to Reisner for advice, where to settle, what to do, blah, blah, blah, blah.

34:08.521 --> 34:15.071
and, well, he always gave him a wrong advice, but he didn't want any competition.

34:15.091 --> 34:18.376
He was that kind of a... He was in the region.

34:18.396 --> 34:22.943
His wife is still alive somewhere in California.

34:23.023 --> 34:27.109
So don't say too much terrible about her.

34:27.410 --> 34:33.179
I don't know where she is at that, but somebody told me that she spoke to Mrs. Reich.

34:33.199 --> 34:38.106
And he had a very dear little girl and daughter, and she was, when I...

34:38.660 --> 34:39.381
daughter.

34:39.561 --> 34:41.123
Alice was around six.

34:41.864 --> 34:42.966
And he was very sweet.

34:42.986 --> 34:44.828
And he was about six years a day.

34:44.988 --> 34:46.751
And very sweet to daughter.

34:47.431 --> 34:55.742
And I felt anybody who was nice to a child and a daughter had something good in him.

34:55.762 --> 34:59.026
And as I say, writes new books.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.911
And his first catalog was a German catalog.

35:03.632 --> 35:05.194
It's always his second.

35:05.535 --> 35:07.958
But he put out a catalog on French

35:08.731 --> 35:12.314
Science, which was a marvelous catalog.

35:12.334 --> 35:13.776
He was very smart.

35:14.276 --> 35:29.810
He would buy, say, a rung of the French philosophical papers in the 18th century, break it up and present papers of Diderot and what's his name?

35:30.111 --> 35:32.233
Alain Bay and all these things.

35:32.473 --> 35:34.294
He brought in a new element.

35:34.655 --> 35:37.197
He stimulated American book collection.

35:37.297 --> 35:38.198
They all did.

35:38.752 --> 35:41.114
And, for instance, Krausland.

35:41.274 --> 35:43.336
Great, great books, as we know.

35:43.356 --> 35:47.981
Kraus came to this country with a copy of the Columbus Ladder.

35:48.001 --> 35:50.563
Well, you don't need much more to get started.

35:51.204 --> 35:56.129
You sell a copy of the Columbus Ladder, you can buy a lot of books.

35:56.149 --> 35:58.311
Sure, but you've got a reputation for having them.

35:58.451 --> 35:59.332
Right, big books.

35:59.352 --> 36:02.415
And Krausland only had big, big books.

36:02.435 --> 36:06.919
But, of course, they were all, not all, Ranchford was very sweet.

36:07.270 --> 36:11.234
Cramps was a fencer, Vincent's.

36:13.377 --> 36:18.743
After two years, I haven't been here, he wrote an article.

36:18.763 --> 36:21.385
How do we form the American book trade?

36:22.887 --> 36:24.469
The antiquarian book trade.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.731
And I met him.

36:28.373 --> 36:30.896
And I met him on Madison Avenue.

36:31.476 --> 36:34.780
And he said, hey, young lady, you must read this.

36:35.637 --> 36:40.553
I said, Mr. Krause, this is not going to sit down with the American book trail.

36:41.436 --> 36:48.600
I mean, if he's here two years, he's telling... How do we call the American book trail?

36:48.850 --> 36:51.453
This was the attitude.

36:51.533 --> 36:53.215
Yeah, but they did enrich you.

36:53.235 --> 36:55.478
They did enrich you.

36:55.498 --> 36:56.600
Did he publish the article?

36:56.640 --> 36:57.641
Of course.

36:57.661 --> 36:59.443
What was the publication?

36:59.463 --> 37:00.324
He was shameless.

37:00.344 --> 37:02.687
He was probably a collector's item.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.229
He was shameless.

37:04.249 --> 37:08.134
What publication did the appear in?

37:08.154 --> 37:10.437
It was just a private pamphlet.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.724
Johnson's still alive, isn't he?

37:13.744 --> 37:14.425
I don't know.

37:14.445 --> 37:15.146
He must be back.

37:15.166 --> 37:18.911
Haven't heard about him every, or Walter Johnson.

37:19.031 --> 37:19.131
Yeah.

37:19.151 --> 37:21.334
Somebody said that he probably won't talk to people.

37:21.354 --> 37:33.330
I mean, when we first heard about Walter Johnson, somebody said to Reich, you mean the ball player, because he was a great baseball player.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.753
The famous pitcher, that's right.

37:35.773 --> 37:36.214
Right.

37:36.234 --> 37:37.015
From the Washington Center.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.022
That's what I thought they were talking about.

37:40.142 --> 37:42.504
And Reissner would have these ladies come in.

37:43.045 --> 37:51.053
Of course, Miss Hunt was a great botanical collector.

37:51.593 --> 37:54.556
And he would prostrate himself in front of them.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.239
I had a whole little ladder, among God.

37:57.259 --> 38:05.888
And some would say, Mr. Reissner, Mr. Reissner, they called him, Mr. Reissner, do you have any kids only know, sir?

38:07.066 --> 38:09.008
And he would go crazy.

38:09.149 --> 38:12.773
He would say to me, what did he want to give me this?

38:13.194 --> 38:14.475
I said, it's a plan.

38:15.997 --> 38:21.924
Let me ask you, after all these years, and I sense it in the book, you still get a thrill, don't you?

38:22.245 --> 38:27.571
You still do when we have the opportunity to find something truly fun.

38:27.671 --> 38:32.157
I had a book fair about 15 years ago.

38:32.237 --> 38:34.660
New York, not the New York book fair.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.154
a sort of a local book fair.

38:38.356 --> 38:46.445
Madeline was at one end of the dealer's exhibit, not at the other, looking around and looking up there.

38:47.266 --> 38:52.332
And when Madeline finds something, she uses a different book.

38:52.352 --> 38:56.758
She said, Leona, come over here.

38:56.778 --> 38:58.880
I knew something was cruel.

38:59.601 --> 39:02.925
I went over and she found

39:03.412 --> 39:06.656
The repressed book.

39:07.076 --> 39:10.280
With Brewster's name and name.

39:10.300 --> 39:13.224
Three of them were published with his name.

39:13.464 --> 39:21.274
One of the, if not the rarest, one of the rarest, which are all so rare.

39:21.354 --> 39:27.942
The dealer, we try to show no emotion, of course.

39:28.062 --> 39:31.326
We think we'll take this thing and a couple of other things.

39:31.863 --> 39:34.768
calling it a thing, sort of, you know.

39:35.569 --> 39:36.831
Well, it had the price on.

39:36.851 --> 39:39.115
There was no point in the... It was $30.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.857
He had no idea.

39:40.877 --> 39:43.742
He put down on the bill one old book.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.648
This is a very well-known American deal.

39:47.688 --> 39:50.873
Well, it was a dealer who specializes in that corner.

39:50.893 --> 39:51.494
A dealer from the white man.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.656
A dealer from the white man.

39:53.328 --> 39:56.271
Can you tell me who he is, just out of curiosity?

39:56.431 --> 39:58.894
No, absolutely not.

39:58.974 --> 40:00.515
I don't hold him guilty.

40:00.735 --> 40:01.396
It's not guilty.

40:01.436 --> 40:03.278
You can't know everything.

40:03.798 --> 40:07.062
I'm sure we've let a lot of questions pass through our hands.

40:08.003 --> 40:09.524
We were in London.

40:11.426 --> 40:14.549
And we dropped in at H.M.

40:14.649 --> 40:16.571
Fletcher in Southport.

40:17.512 --> 40:21.696
And we said, what have you got?

40:21.796 --> 40:22.677
Got anything?

40:22.927 --> 40:26.972
He said, there were bits and pieces down in the floor, down in the basement.

40:26.992 --> 40:27.753
Go have a look.

40:28.014 --> 40:30.477
You said that in the book, yeah, that was great.

40:30.617 --> 40:31.698
Oh, you read the story?

40:31.798 --> 40:33.601
There were bits and pieces, yeah.

40:33.621 --> 40:35.664
I read the whole book.

40:35.684 --> 40:40.510
And we found the first book published by the first book, the AIM.

40:41.271 --> 40:45.616
It had been there 14 years on the floor.

40:46.738 --> 40:50.723
Fletcher had gotten a collection for cottage

40:51.445 --> 40:53.348
Robinson.

40:53.368 --> 40:57.714
No, from, oh God, the actor.

40:57.734 --> 40:58.695
Oh, Peter Murray Hill.

40:58.715 --> 41:00.118
Peter Murray Hill.

41:00.138 --> 41:07.729
Peter Murray Hill, for the case of wine, had taken the lecto was from Robinson.

41:07.749 --> 41:08.289
From Robinson.

41:10.152 --> 41:11.534
They had creamed it.

41:11.734 --> 41:12.876
They creamed it.

41:13.677 --> 41:15.380
Murray Hill had creamed it.

41:15.780 --> 41:17.443
And Pledge has thrown the rest.

41:17.563 --> 41:19.025
My physiology, I don't know.

41:19.045 --> 41:19.546
I love that.

41:19.566 --> 41:19.866
I love that.

41:20.065 --> 41:21.627
more of a cream that I've never had.

41:22.128 --> 41:24.912
There was a bit of whipped cream on the floor there.

41:25.573 --> 41:31.442
And we got... Actually, when we bought it, we didn't realize.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.004
We bought it very quickly.

41:33.565 --> 41:36.710
And we bought, we saw the title, we thought we could use it.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.333
We didn't bother with the imprint when we bought it.

41:40.074 --> 41:48.587
And our question is, when we got back from Europe, Matty would sit with a typewriter, and I would skim it off, say, theology,

41:48.989 --> 41:51.092
And we shall forget the title.

41:52.434 --> 41:57.040
I look at the imprint I see lied in the room.

41:57.060 --> 42:00.485
That's amazing.

42:01.306 --> 42:16.768
Well, we put it in the clock of the catalog at the time, and we received a table of lecture, not a very kind table, that he realized we'd bought it from him.

42:19.280 --> 42:27.390
Oh, it's his own fault in 14 years to go to his staff and not left everything on the floor.

42:27.410 --> 42:29.173
He had a price, didn't he?

42:29.193 --> 42:30.514
He gave it away.

42:30.835 --> 42:33.018
Maybe the halogen bulb went out.

42:33.538 --> 42:35.701
I think he bought it a lot.

42:35.841 --> 42:39.386
But the halogen bulb just blew.

42:41.389 --> 42:42.570
Maybe the socket.

42:44.845 --> 42:46.667
I was on the whole time.

42:47.228 --> 42:50.251
Is that the one they just changed?

42:51.312 --> 42:51.712
No.

42:52.373 --> 42:56.958
We have to get another one of those.

42:56.978 --> 42:59.401
Where do we get them?

42:59.421 --> 43:01.443
They're out of existence.

43:01.683 --> 43:06.568
Lights or light on the air or something.

43:07.669 --> 43:08.771
Can you see?

43:08.871 --> 43:09.952
Oh, I'm fine.

43:09.972 --> 43:10.873
I'm fine.

43:11.694 --> 43:12.895
Don't worry about me.

43:13.583 --> 43:16.408
You're still active as book fillers?

43:16.548 --> 43:18.151
We're still active.

43:18.211 --> 43:21.417
We have a capital ready for the fame.

43:21.938 --> 43:22.319
Really?

43:23.401 --> 43:24.182
Is this a theme?

43:24.282 --> 43:25.985
It doesn't have a theme.

43:26.165 --> 43:27.568
You can have a theme.

43:27.848 --> 43:31.335
Should we show it to you?

43:31.795 --> 43:33.959
You can have a theme for the fame.

43:33.979 --> 43:35.001
You can.

43:35.021 --> 43:36.604
You have a customer comes.

43:36.803 --> 43:39.067
What do you have on Gibraltar?

43:39.167 --> 43:43.796
Actually, that's right, because... No, and the next customers will say, what do you have on knitting?

43:43.976 --> 43:48.324
You really want to have something... You have to have something for nearly everybody, you can.

43:48.784 --> 43:50.127
What do you have on music?

43:50.147 --> 43:51.329
We do have on music.

43:51.349 --> 43:56.078
We have the first book in which Mozart is in.

43:56.779 --> 44:00.786
But you can't satisfy everything in the fair.

44:01.171 --> 44:03.153
What do you have on the Restoration?

44:03.193 --> 44:06.397
What do you have on Napoleon?

44:06.437 --> 44:08.960
You know, it goes on and on and on.

44:08.981 --> 44:10.623
What do you have on Lee?

44:10.643 --> 44:12.525
Well, he can have it.

44:12.545 --> 44:13.086
May I have this?

44:13.106 --> 44:13.646
Of course.

44:13.666 --> 44:16.149
In fact, I'll ask you to describe it before I leave it.

44:16.169 --> 44:19.433
What do you have on Martin Luther King?

44:19.493 --> 44:20.735
It goes on and on.

44:21.796 --> 44:23.618
What do you have on the Aldean Press?

44:24.740 --> 44:29.085
So you try, but you can't, to have a little bit of everything.

44:29.420 --> 44:31.282
Do you mind if I mention this in the piece?

44:31.522 --> 44:33.044
Because this won't come out.

44:33.204 --> 44:34.946
By June it will be passed.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.668
But my point, because it's very illustrative.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.591
I mean, it's a point I want to make.

44:40.651 --> 44:43.875
You're still very active, and here's your catalog.

44:44.455 --> 44:46.678
Proof positive.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.621
I don't think the business search is not what it was.

44:50.101 --> 44:55.767
I think there was a time without any exaggeration that we sold nearly every American.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.009
We don't travel the way we used to.

44:58.149 --> 44:58.870
We don't travel.

44:59.002 --> 45:02.225
And that's one reason that we're more limited.

45:02.706 --> 45:11.935
Leonie said that you do, you think you at one time sold something to every, maybe... Almost to every American heart.

45:12.215 --> 45:16.740
We sold, we would get two orders a day when there were two mares a day from Yale.

45:18.402 --> 45:20.964
We sold to Harvard.

45:21.345 --> 45:24.908
Pennsylvania, we never sold much to Columbia.

45:25.609 --> 45:27.591
Princeton.

45:28.853 --> 45:47.534
You tell the story in the book, Leona had a treasure trove at the Columbia bookstore back in the 40s, where they discarded books for no reason at all, except that they probably just didn't like the way they looked.

45:47.554 --> 45:52.279
She found, found with another book, which tells the story in the book,

45:52.748 --> 45:55.892
the first edition of Descartes and the Passions of the Soul.

45:55.912 --> 45:57.274
I love that story.

45:57.294 --> 46:02.600
And one of the orders for it, when she offered it, came from Columbia.

46:02.741 --> 46:13.494
In fact, this notebook, by the way, I do... These are my reading notes from the book, which I say, en route to London, Flight 156, when I read this book.

46:13.855 --> 46:20.803
And all of these little stories where you have the great vines, I actually have them all written down on the page number, because I love them.

46:20.823 --> 46:22.165
I love them.

46:22.803 --> 46:29.553
Well, but we really didn't show Florida to University of Kentucky.

46:29.873 --> 46:30.594
You name it.

46:30.614 --> 46:31.295
Everywhere.

46:31.315 --> 46:32.216
But now.

46:32.357 --> 46:33.438
They don't buy.

46:33.498 --> 46:35.822
I'm sure they're not buying rare books.

46:36.062 --> 46:37.244
The whole taste of books.

46:37.264 --> 46:39.707
Brigham Young isn't buying rare books anymore.

46:39.887 --> 46:41.470
The whole taste of books.

46:41.870 --> 46:43.012
They change their policies.

46:43.032 --> 46:45.956
Can I talk a little bit about the taste of books and how that's changing?

46:46.016 --> 46:49.641
I think that's something I'd be interested in.

46:49.761 --> 46:51.544
Well, I think computerization

46:52.064 --> 46:54.206
is responsible to some extent.

46:55.688 --> 46:59.171
Look... In what respect would you think of the computer?

46:59.191 --> 47:00.632
They're not buying rare books.

47:00.712 --> 47:05.397
Instead, they're computerizing everything.

47:05.417 --> 47:09.701
Putting the money as equitable in their funds are not limitless.

47:10.142 --> 47:17.869
If an English major is not responsible, he does not have to be responsible for reading,

47:18.929 --> 47:22.313
Georgia, Milton.

47:22.333 --> 47:26.558
By the way, I'm having a chapter on that in the new book.

47:26.578 --> 47:28.640
I've already interviewed Harold Bloom for this.

47:29.741 --> 47:32.845
It bothers me that you can get a degree in English literature.

47:33.045 --> 47:44.358
In English, not just literature, but English from... Everhurst College, two years ago, graduated summa cum laude.

47:44.398 --> 47:47.822
They actually conferred a summa cum laude degree to an English major

47:48.157 --> 47:52.023
who had never taken a course in Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, Spencer.

47:52.924 --> 47:53.845
This will change.

47:53.945 --> 47:54.927
How is it possible?

47:55.007 --> 47:59.353
How can you possibly purport to be... It has to change, and it will change.

47:59.553 --> 48:07.565
Unfortunately, it's got to do with various political... It's a political debate.

48:08.146 --> 48:09.327
It's not a literary debate.

48:09.347 --> 48:10.589
It's not a cultural debate.

48:10.629 --> 48:11.611
It's a political debate.

48:12.392 --> 48:13.794
And it has to change.

48:13.854 --> 48:14.755
I know.

48:15.224 --> 48:18.667
For my Ph.D., there was compulsory reading.

48:20.569 --> 48:30.637
In 19th-century German historians and people like that, for me, nobody would even look at tragedy today.

48:30.717 --> 48:31.999
It was insufferable.

48:32.419 --> 48:37.103
But this Columbia demanded, and it demanded a knowledge of German.

48:37.163 --> 48:41.827
They had to take tests in German, French, Latin for the degree.

48:43.268 --> 48:45.130
Today, who cares?

48:45.700 --> 49:02.528
In a way, it might be totally ecstatic, shall I say, sitting there groaning over the 19th century German story, and nothing to give a damn about it.

49:02.548 --> 49:05.794
You mentioned briefly in the book about the Fourth Avenue bookstores.

49:06.415 --> 49:08.078
Could you talk a little bit about that?

49:08.098 --> 49:10.261
You know whom you should speak to?

49:10.281 --> 49:10.662
Marvin Marlin.

49:10.793 --> 49:13.776
I actually went down the Strand yesterday looking for him.

49:13.796 --> 49:15.098
He hasn't been in a long time.

49:15.338 --> 49:16.940
He doesn't come in every day.

49:17.160 --> 49:17.780
Yeah.

49:18.081 --> 49:19.702
I hope he's still working on that book.

49:19.763 --> 49:21.204
It sounded like a wonderful idea.

49:21.224 --> 49:24.548
Well, he wanted me to do the introduction to it, actually.

49:25.228 --> 49:30.134
But, well, I don't know if he's still working on it or not.

49:31.135 --> 49:34.638
I think I'm going to do an interview with him and just have him talk about it.

49:34.859 --> 49:36.160
Because it was...

49:41.118 --> 49:43.861
Pansion's daughter is still around.

49:44.502 --> 49:46.704
Sidney Solomon's daughter.

49:46.805 --> 49:48.046
Who is this?

49:48.066 --> 49:48.887
Sidney Solomon.

49:48.927 --> 50:06.147
You know, we were talking about this with these boys and noble people at lunch the other day, and they too regretted the passing of 4th Avenue, and they feel that they feel they're replacing

50:06.633 --> 50:08.395
Which, of course, they're not.

50:08.435 --> 50:09.737
They can never do that.

50:09.757 --> 50:09.897
No way.

50:10.298 --> 50:10.979
No way.

50:11.019 --> 50:16.226
We suggested they build up a rare book arm.

50:17.187 --> 50:18.409
It didn't have to be rare.

50:18.429 --> 50:20.552
It's second-hand bookstores there.

50:20.692 --> 50:22.495
Because that was the whole Fourth Avenue play.

50:22.515 --> 50:23.857
It wasn't a rare book area.

50:23.877 --> 50:25.118
It was second-hand.

50:25.138 --> 50:26.781
Well, obviously, you wouldn't know.

50:27.682 --> 50:33.670
Of course, Judy Conig, obviously, I mean, she personally wouldn't know what she wanted.

50:34.072 --> 50:36.454
from what her father had known.

50:36.735 --> 50:38.216
Judy, what's her name?

50:38.236 --> 50:38.957
Judy Stone, obviously.

50:39.097 --> 50:41.119
Judy Lowry.

50:41.399 --> 50:42.400
Oh, George's wife.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.922
George's wife, yes.

50:44.502 --> 50:51.650
She, I think, might know, or, you know, remember what her father knows.

50:51.670 --> 50:53.331
So her father was in business?

50:53.351 --> 50:56.475
I think he began down on North Avenue.

50:56.495 --> 50:59.978
He made a tremendous success moving up to 59 years.

51:00.245 --> 51:07.656
So can you see what this new book is going to be about book culture on the eve of a new millennium?

51:07.817 --> 51:12.504
Oh, I hope not.

51:12.664 --> 51:15.048
Let's hope it's not an archaeological study.

51:15.068 --> 51:17.612
Well, just take heart from this.

51:18.133 --> 51:25.604
There are brand new libraries being built all over the world with unprecedented... I was just in the brand new British Library last week.

51:25.624 --> 51:26.365
I got a tour.

51:26.586 --> 51:27.467
It hasn't opened yet.

51:27.835 --> 51:31.179
Wait till you see this extraordinary new building.

51:31.199 --> 51:34.563
The new French library, the Germans are building a new library, the Japanese.

51:35.044 --> 51:39.089
The New York Public Library just opened a new facility down on Madison Avenue.

51:39.169 --> 51:46.858
The San Francisco Public Library, Cleveland, there is an explosion of new library construction.

51:46.878 --> 51:48.240
Yes, there are things, but do they have both?

51:48.473 --> 51:50.995
Well, thankfully they have shelves.

51:51.015 --> 51:53.198
They have shelves, but they can't afford yet.

51:53.438 --> 51:58.863
And Barnes & Noble feels that it is replacing many of the lost books.

51:58.883 --> 52:02.927
And if you walk into a Barnes & Noble, it's then arrested.

52:02.947 --> 52:03.648
No, they're mobbed.

52:03.788 --> 52:07.291
Of course, they sell cappuccino and they have a Starbucks coffee.

52:07.311 --> 52:07.912
It's a social place.

52:07.932 --> 52:10.154
I don't think that's their main business.

52:10.594 --> 52:11.455
But you know what?

52:11.475 --> 52:15.800
They have to have it because people make it a social problem.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.361
There's nothing wrong with that.

52:17.381 --> 52:18.362
No, it's wonderful.

52:18.477 --> 52:20.599
And they do sit around and read it.

52:20.719 --> 52:21.901
Yeah, no, no, it's great.

52:21.981 --> 52:24.263
Every place, because I've done some signings at St.

52:24.283 --> 52:26.826
Barnes and Noble, and it's amazing how mugged they are.

52:27.006 --> 52:29.609
Going into Saturday, they're mugged.

52:29.649 --> 52:33.873
I mean, the fact that they are so interested in our autobiography.

52:34.674 --> 52:37.276
I love it, yeah.

52:37.357 --> 52:39.138
There are many reasons.

52:39.158 --> 52:40.440
One, it's New York.

52:41.681 --> 52:45.565
Two, it's a story to learn the country, though.

52:46.692 --> 52:48.920
It's a success story.

52:48.960 --> 52:53.316
There was trouble, but it came through.

52:53.457 --> 52:57.471
We're old ladies now lighting up on Mars.

52:57.491 --> 52:58.575
I love it.

52:58.724 --> 53:01.788
It is two women, you're pioneers, without a doubt.

53:02.268 --> 53:06.714
The first president, the first woman president of the ABAA.

53:06.774 --> 53:08.596
No, no, she wasn't.

53:08.756 --> 53:11.139
I'm sorry, Frances Hamill.

53:11.159 --> 53:12.841
I'm sorry, Frances Hamill.

53:13.021 --> 53:15.624
She was from Chicago, right?

53:15.664 --> 53:18.307
My main bookseller, she was really very good.

53:19.108 --> 53:19.669
Very good.

53:20.223 --> 53:23.167
But actually, it had been many years before, hadn't it?

53:23.227 --> 53:28.294
She was president around 1954.

53:29.876 --> 53:33.340
But I also like the work that you did on developing the book fair.

53:33.541 --> 53:41.351
I mean, you have the perception to see that this is something that would really... And it really did change, I think, a really democratized book collecting.

53:41.431 --> 53:43.914
That was basically my baby.

53:43.934 --> 53:44.795
The book fair.

53:45.096 --> 53:47.479
And the center.

53:47.898 --> 53:49.700
It's too bad about the center.

53:49.720 --> 53:55.244
It's outrageous that they got rid of the center, and I'm sure they would love to have one today.

53:56.305 --> 53:57.787
You've never saw the center.

53:59.288 --> 54:02.591
Well, I figured not enough money was coming.

54:03.992 --> 54:08.596
Let's see, we've talked about Fourth Avenue.

54:08.616 --> 54:10.018
We've talked about institutions.

54:10.438 --> 54:11.559
We've talked about Reishner.

54:12.340 --> 54:16.183
Of course, we have the book, you know... Oh, let's talk a little bit about...

54:16.636 --> 54:18.178
I think we have to.

54:18.859 --> 54:21.763
That really did bring the New York Times here, didn't it?

54:21.803 --> 54:26.589
The resurgence of interest in Alspot, I guess.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.691
Certainly to a great extent.

54:28.711 --> 54:37.623
I mean, because all of a sudden, what caused this... Well, we had been written up in the Times before.

54:38.063 --> 54:45.833
But that was also in connection, I think... No, that was in connection with old and rare, with our first... Oh, really?

54:46.015 --> 54:49.062
Our first collaboration, yes.

54:49.082 --> 54:51.087
And that was 20 years ago?

54:51.127 --> 54:52.831
That was 20 years before.

54:53.713 --> 55:00.649
And then, after Old and Rare, about a year later,

55:01.220 --> 55:03.883
I brought out Behind a Mask.

55:03.903 --> 55:07.146
Leona had discovered the pseudonym of Louisa Alcott.

55:07.246 --> 55:08.207
We tell it's funny.

55:08.327 --> 55:09.729
That's Anne Bernard that we had.

55:09.789 --> 55:10.990
Back in the 40s.

55:11.190 --> 55:16.796
And I had used it in my biography of Alcott, which came out in 1950.

55:18.899 --> 55:21.421
But people forget very quickly.

55:21.802 --> 55:30.771
And then that morning in 1974, when I said to Leona, gee, they're reprinting everything these days, but they never

55:31.156 --> 55:33.338
have reprinted those wonderful stories.

55:33.358 --> 55:35.260
I'm going to do it.

55:35.460 --> 55:36.261
And I did it.

55:36.742 --> 55:48.754
That came out in 1975, and that led to a lot of brouhaha, including the articles in The Times and an interview with Barbara Walters on The Today Show.

55:48.774 --> 55:51.157
You say on the book that she was more interested in it.

55:51.397 --> 55:53.239
I showed that to my wife in the plane.

55:53.259 --> 55:54.180
I said, look at this.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.903
Why Louisa never died.

55:56.923 --> 55:59.005
Oh, never died.

55:59.045 --> 55:59.205
Yeah.

55:59.557 --> 56:00.558
Anyway.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.945
But she was very good and nice to work with.

56:05.965 --> 56:11.792
Well, anyway, I think that led to the... Is that the phone?

56:11.812 --> 56:12.573
That is good.

56:12.593 --> 56:13.093
That's it.

56:13.113 --> 56:20.803
That led to some interest in the part of Tom.

56:21.283 --> 56:24.067
Certainly, this last interview with the Tom.

56:24.167 --> 56:24.768
Tanisha?

56:24.908 --> 56:25.228
No.

56:25.408 --> 56:26.189
Oh, look.

56:26.329 --> 56:29.153
Well, Louise, in fact, it was a movie.

56:29.193 --> 56:29.293
Yeah.

56:29.780 --> 56:35.609
And the long fatal love chase, and what Random House paid for it.

56:35.949 --> 56:48.488
You see, Random House paid, well, I don't think they paid, whatever, they didn't pay quite as much as they were said to have paid, but it got, it was in the news, it was big money.

56:49.269 --> 56:50.410
I heard it was a million dollars.

56:50.651 --> 56:54.797
Yeah, I know you did, but so it was maybe three quarters of it.

56:54.817 --> 56:59.584
That guy, I'm going to say it, Nicholas, I'm going to say it loud and long, the guy,

56:59.969 --> 57:07.841
who dared say to the paper that he really discovered Louisa's secret life and all this.

57:07.861 --> 57:09.203
Oh, that's criminal.

57:09.223 --> 57:10.885
He had been trained by Nancy.

57:11.586 --> 57:12.908
I don't think he said that.

57:13.008 --> 57:19.898
Well, he posed as the discoverer of Louisa's office.

57:19.918 --> 57:21.060
It's all been righted.

57:21.160 --> 57:27.490
I can assure you that that guy's name isn't even going to be mentioned in this.

57:27.510 --> 57:29.773
I know who to scream.

57:30.108 --> 57:39.737
The point is that after they bought The Long Fable of Chase, Random House came running to me.

57:40.437 --> 57:48.305
Will I do a modern library book of her thrillers, and what about my biography?

57:48.425 --> 57:49.646
Can they reprint it?

57:50.126 --> 57:52.248
So, I have no complaints.

57:52.989 --> 57:57.313
I did do a modern library book for them, and I did do

57:57.935 --> 58:00.238
I gave them the biography.

58:00.298 --> 58:11.633
They got it from the University of Oklahoma Press, which kept it in print, and published a paperback, a thing, reprinted it.

58:12.033 --> 58:15.858
So that was okay.

58:15.938 --> 58:19.683
But the movie did a lot to popularize it.

58:19.703 --> 58:21.025
The movie publicized her again.

58:21.906 --> 58:24.249
Did you see the movie by any?

58:24.269 --> 58:25.771
Yeah, look, I'll tell you a cute story.

58:26.752 --> 58:27.553
She was doing it here.

58:28.090 --> 58:28.652
Excuse me.
