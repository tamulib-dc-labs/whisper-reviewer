But more on that later.

01:00.663 --> 01:03.087
Let's begin with the super marketers.

01:03.628 --> 01:12.984
Drawing on the most compelling and famous marketing examples, noted author Robert Heller shares with you the ten guidelines that can make you a super marketer.

01:13.645 --> 01:18.573
Let's listen in on the fourth one, marketing to get and keep customers.

01:19.174 --> 01:26.907
Some marketers make the mistake of trying to make the market respond to their product instead of having their product respond to the market.

01:27.342 --> 01:34.855
In the past, this has been the typical Detroit procedure, to build a car and then try to identify its buyers.

01:35.536 --> 01:45.093
But the story of the birth of Ford's Mustang is a classic case of doing it the right way, a case of a market in search of a product and not the other way around.

01:46.255 --> 01:47.157
Ford's research

01:47.423 --> 01:53.215
had shown clearly that there was a real market for a car with an unmistakable youthful image.

01:53.856 --> 01:58.385
So the car makers were able to tailor their new Mustang for a hungry new market.

01:59.127 --> 02:02.293
But the approach was a little more sophisticated than that.

02:02.881 --> 02:18.186
First, Ford went about making the market powerfully aware of its hunger, and then it satisfied that appetite with a plentiful supply of a car with three marketing points, great styling, strong performance, and a low price.

02:18.847 --> 02:24.737
Now, let's hear some innovative techniques you can use to escape common organizational traps.

02:24.717 --> 02:37.357
In The Effective Executive, Peter Drucker, considered the father of the science of management, shows you how to develop skills that fulfill the ultimate management goal, getting things done right.

02:37.837 --> 02:44.327
Effectiveness is a habit, by which I mean a complex of practices, and practices can always be learned.

02:44.768 --> 02:50.657
There is no reason why anyone with normal endowment should not acquire competence in any practice.

02:50.992 --> 02:56.362
There are essentially five practices that have to be acquired to be an effective executive.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.648
One, managing time effectively.

03:00.369 --> 03:06.380
Two, focusing on one's overall contribution rather than on the details of work to be done.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.932
Three, building on one's strengths and those of superiors, colleagues and subordinates.

03:13.435 --> 03:17.040
Four, setting priorities and staying with those decisions.

03:17.701 --> 03:25.372
Five, making effective decisions, basing judgments on dissenting opinions rather than on consensus on the facts.

03:26.173 --> 03:29.078
Next, we have Robert Half on hiring.

03:29.598 --> 03:35.367
Here, nationally recognized employment expert Robert Half shows you how to hire the right people.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.172
Most executives base their hiring decisions on intuition.

03:39.773 --> 03:42.497
Here's what Robert Half has to say about that.

03:43.321 --> 03:45.244
Avoid the cloning trap.

03:45.884 --> 03:52.213
It's human nature to be drawn to people whose background and thinking are similar to your own, but you may shortchange yourself.

03:52.833 --> 04:03.407
The predictable result of hiring mirror images is that a company or department will be strong in those areas in which you are strong, weak in those areas in which you are weak.

04:03.427 --> 04:06.912
The most successful companies have diversity in their top management team.

04:07.813 --> 04:09.615
Hiring should be based on balance.

04:10.116 --> 04:13.260
You should select people with an eye on how they fit the team.

04:14.219 --> 04:17.627
hiring strong people can only enhance your career.

04:18.228 --> 04:23.961
They will not only improve the efficiency of your department, but you will become known as someone who hires winners.

04:24.482 --> 04:26.727
That's not a bad reputation to have.

04:27.382 --> 04:36.872
Finally, let's explore the intricacies of making effective speeches and presentations with lessons from a master communicator himself, Steve Allen.

04:37.532 --> 04:45.581
In How to Make a Speech, Allen draws from 40 years of experience at the podium with such tried and tested methods as this one.

04:45.941 --> 04:47.923
It's important to get the feel of your audience.

04:48.403 --> 04:53.929
If you're not sure about the bias and emotions of those you're addressing, just to listen to their responses.

04:54.466 --> 05:02.899
While making a campaign speech, a candidate was trying to discover the dominant religion of his audience, and he began by saying, My great-grandfather was an Episcopalian.

05:03.279 --> 05:04.501
There was stony silence.

05:04.521 --> 05:08.207
But he continued, My great-grandmother belonged to the Congregational Church.

05:09.028 --> 05:09.789
Again, silence.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.253
My grandfather was a Baptist.

05:13.194 --> 05:14.055
More silence.

05:14.075 --> 05:15.878
While my grandmother was a Presbyterian.

05:16.279 --> 05:17.060
Still nothing.

05:17.941 --> 05:19.684
But I had a great-aunt who was a Methodist.

05:20.185 --> 05:20.806
Yay!

05:20.986 --> 05:21.807
Loud applause.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.078
and I have always followed my great aunt.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.282
Sustained cheering.

05:25.342 --> 05:26.164
The man was elected.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.390
The point's really a simple one.

05:28.691 --> 05:33.483
It'll be to your advantage to know how your audience feels about the subject on which you're speaking.

05:34.125 --> 05:38.597
You need not ingratiate yourself with them if that's not your purpose, but you should know where they stand.
