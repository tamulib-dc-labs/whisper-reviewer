00:03.085 --> 00:09.150
The Innovation Department at Yale, since 1992, is well known to many of you.

00:10.872 --> 00:14.395
Preservation microphone frames to digital images.

00:15.896 --> 00:30.809
Prior to Yale, Paul conducted research projects for three years at the National Archives, including a study of research using archives and a review of how government agencies implement digital imaging and optical technology.

00:30.829 --> 00:32.991
During 1988-89,

00:33.308 --> 00:46.459
He served as the Preservation Program Officer of the Office for the Society of American Archivists in Chicago, where he carried out a nationwide survey of archival preservation programs.

00:46.479 --> 00:52.925
He began his professional career as an archivist on the staff of the Gerald Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:53.625 --> 01:00.511
He has a master's degree and a PhD in information and library studies both from the University of Michigan.

01:00.531 --> 01:02.573
Paul is widely published.

01:02.857 --> 01:05.581
on both preservation and archival management topics.

01:06.382 --> 01:11.830
Most recently, his writing has focused on the challenges of preserving library resources in a digital format.

01:13.773 --> 01:21.664
Paul also wanted me to note to you that his talk will be on the Nellahan website.

01:23.207 --> 01:28.915
And he also has a handout within the packet of websites you can go to.

01:41.753 --> 01:45.883
Thank you.

01:45.903 --> 01:51.577
I have the good fortune of being the only person on the program today who is also with a digital reality one.

01:51.597 --> 01:53.502
So I have the two years ago.

01:54.055 --> 02:02.068
So I have the advantage of the opportunity to connect some dots that wouldn't necessarily be able to be connected otherwise.

02:02.148 --> 02:03.851
A lot has happened in two years.

02:03.871 --> 02:06.536
Digital reality one was only two years ago.

02:06.556 --> 02:16.092
It feels like all of a sudden there's a lot of renewed interest or new interest in preserving a born digital material that is reborn in digital form.

02:16.292 --> 02:19.978
I also have a few other challenges.

02:20.397 --> 02:25.342
One is to keep you awake after lunch.

02:25.542 --> 02:34.451
And the third obligation that I have is, I think, is a mixed obligation.

02:34.591 --> 02:45.882
One is, the simple part is to set up the issues so that the following two speakers have a context within which to build their comments about stimulation and migration.

02:46.250 --> 03:06.908
i think that at a larger level what i'm trying to get at is is kind of get you to walk out of the room and say yes yes this is something i need to think about yes this is something i need to do and yes this is something that is doable by in this particular case the idea that preservation has a role to play in the building

03:07.090 --> 03:07.931
So I'd like to start.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.936
So in essence, my topic is really three parts.

03:10.956 --> 03:17.646
I want to provide the context, talk about the debates on digital preservation and points to some issues.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.050
We'll start with the context of today.

03:21.091 --> 03:22.674
We're living in a digital world.

03:22.694 --> 03:23.215
We know this.

03:23.455 --> 03:25.078
The evidence is everywhere.

03:25.098 --> 03:29.825
But I'd like to give you, at least for starters, the five top reasons I think we're living in the digital world.

03:31.087 --> 03:35.173
Archive has become a verb.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.404
The archivist in me still cringes.

03:38.584 --> 03:41.427
I can't seem to get away from it.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.472
Keyboard's now a number of office workers.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.494
I think it's almost two to one now.

03:46.514 --> 03:47.915
There are more keywords than there are people who do the work.

03:48.716 --> 03:55.184
I read last week in the New York Times that there's now a hyperlink for every man, woman, and child in the face of the earth.

03:55.204 --> 03:58.208
Seven billion plus links.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.771
Nobody carries cash.

04:02.031 --> 04:05.456
And the final reason.

04:06.157 --> 04:09.141
Profit is accepted.

04:09.161 --> 04:13.588
We know we're in a digital world when they have to get money.

04:13.608 --> 04:14.869
Okay.

04:14.890 --> 04:24.083
We also know we're in a digital world because the digital world is changed by a way of thinking about how we relate to each other.

04:24.103 --> 04:24.563
Can you read that?

04:24.583 --> 04:26.406
Go ask your search engine.

04:27.297 --> 04:42.437
Okay, what I'm going to do is lay the context in terms of both time and space for digital preservation to talk about the issues that there seems to be a genuine debate about whether digital preservation is

04:42.603 --> 04:45.966
appropriate or not, whether the work we do is only access.

04:46.647 --> 04:54.195
And in the process of doing so, there are some definitions that I hope will help us through the rest of the day.

04:54.235 --> 05:03.144
And then point out the definition of digital preservation is only one of the issues that we want to look at down the road.

05:03.164 --> 05:08.610
The first question on the table for us is whether digital preservation is real or not, or simply a metaphor.

05:09.198 --> 05:12.889
There's a lot of talk about that, of course.

05:13.149 --> 05:20.832
And I think I hope that I'll convince you that we're actually reading.

05:20.852 --> 05:20.912
OK.

05:21.382 --> 05:24.586
The place to start is way back in time.

05:24.766 --> 05:42.245
This is a chart that I put in a book I published, a report I published in 1996, Preservation of the Digital World, which basically shows the history of recorded media and the relationship between our ability to store information, and the fragility of the media that we're dealing with.

05:42.526 --> 05:49.093
You'll notice all the way there, media in order when they were popular as recording media, starting with playing tablets and moving all the way up

05:49.073 --> 05:55.445
disks and optical disks through Moby Dick, the beginning of the Brittle Books period, and newspapers, Microdillo and Fiche.

05:55.845 --> 06:09.951
The point here is that as our ability to store material compactly has increased from 50, 60, 40, 100 characters per square inch up to the present 51 million disks and holes twice, three times that now.

06:10.522 --> 06:15.369
The life expectancy of these media has declined equivalently.

06:15.389 --> 06:18.293
And we're looking at a 10,000-year life expectancy here.

06:18.313 --> 06:20.316
A lot more trained and recorded history.

06:20.837 --> 06:27.827
For libraries, archives, and museums, of course, we know that we have the challenge of preserving all of these materials in some form.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.851
Not every library has clay tablets, but there are quite a few out there.

06:31.512 --> 06:35.117
Not every library has illuminated manuscripts, but there are quite a few out there.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.761
And everybody has a brittle book or two floating around.

06:38.956 --> 06:46.507
OK, so where we are now is, as the science fiction writer Bruce Sterling has said, we're in this golden age of dead media.

06:47.047 --> 06:50.512
Most of them are working lives.

06:50.532 --> 06:53.977
And that's kind of where we are now from 10,000 years.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.119
Now we can call that progress.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.567
And I think there is a lot to be said for the progress that we've made in terms of being able to develop new media.

07:00.627 --> 07:04.332
But there's an issue here with the media itself.

07:04.352 --> 07:08.558
Now let's look the other direction.

07:09.365 --> 07:10.386
Do you recognize this?

07:11.787 --> 07:18.453
This is Danny Ilse's Millennium Clock that was unveiled on New Year's Day, the year 2000.

07:19.955 --> 07:22.056
It ticks off the air, long slumps a century.

07:22.937 --> 07:28.202
This item is being built.

07:28.302 --> 07:29.243
It's nine feet tall.

07:29.263 --> 07:30.504
I'll back up.

07:30.524 --> 07:32.466
It's nine feet tall, made out of brass and steel.

07:33.327 --> 07:37.070
And it's being built in the deserts of Utah.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.372
A prototype is being built.

07:39.605 --> 07:44.031
is this little item calibrates automatically.

07:44.051 --> 07:44.912
This is the dial.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.214
It's about two feet in diameter.

07:46.274 --> 07:57.229
It calibrates automatically because we can count on the sun coming up and going down forever, at least until it doesn't come up anymore.

07:57.409 --> 08:00.854
And so it automatically calibrates, but it needs to be wound by human beings.

08:01.635 --> 08:07.823
And in Danny Ellis' design for the Millennium Clock, he was determined that this metaphor of maintenance

08:08.022 --> 08:16.691
the metaphor of human beings' involvement with their technology be preserved in even something that was designed to last 10,000 years.

08:17.052 --> 08:18.833
So now we have a 20,000-year time frame.

08:19.114 --> 08:24.179
Now we've been talking about Twinkies, a pack of Twinkies, where we are in terms of being here today.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.282
Now let's go back a little bit further in time.

08:27.523 --> 08:34.050
The point that I want to make in the next couple of slides is that the digital technology as we know it has been around for a very long time.

08:34.590 --> 08:37.253
The idea of phase two, big sixth grade math,

08:37.621 --> 08:58.159
was full blown from the brilliant mind of Godfrey Wilhelm von Leibniz, who invented the idea of base two and conceived of a mathematical system in which all very life's experience could be coded in ones and zeros some 350 years ago.

08:58.179 --> 09:05.586
And he designed a machine that wasn't built for another 200 years, but the prototype for it was in his notebooks.

09:05.870 --> 09:13.500
for a calculating machine that was based on base two, way before Charles Babbage was born, much less designed his calculating machine, his differential engine.

09:14.071 --> 09:23.222
The other piece of the digital technology that's been around a long time is the idea that what digital is all about is communication, sending information from one space to another.

09:23.242 --> 09:26.385
Now, we've had two centers this morning who've made this point as well.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.547
It's not about the media.

09:27.627 --> 09:32.393
It's not necessarily about necessarily conversion of something.

09:32.413 --> 09:36.197
It's about how we work and live together.

09:36.802 --> 09:54.744
of about a fifth copy of image of what was called the visual telegraph that ran from London to the old 200 years ago, in which a six or seven foot high platform, a person stood on top of that platform and looked to the horizon and waited for the six disks to change pattern.

09:54.764 --> 10:04.817
And when this person saw those disks turn from black to white, he or she replicated, it's probably a he.

10:05.185 --> 10:08.050
turned the blacks from blacks to white.

10:08.070 --> 10:11.476
And a person looking on the horizon in the other direction watched for that to change.

10:11.496 --> 10:19.751
And it was possible to send a digital signal from one coast to another in a matter of 40 or 50 seconds once you got trained.

10:20.272 --> 10:24.460
But of course, there was a tremendous administrative overhead to this kind of thing.

10:25.604 --> 10:33.837
The point here is that we've been concerned as humans about efficient communication and coded communication for a very, very long time.

10:34.318 --> 10:43.613
And even the infrastructure of networks and input-output streams and storage media and digital communication has been a part of our life, many parts of our lives, since World War II.

10:44.116 --> 10:47.141
So this is not a brave new world necessarily.

10:47.342 --> 10:50.507
We have a tremendous amount of stability in the midst of change.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.655
As I've mentioned, we've got digital mathematics theory that's been around for 350 years.

10:54.775 --> 10:58.101
It gives us the tools to do what Tim Berners-Lee described.

10:58.121 --> 11:00.485
He talked about coding the world in mathematical forms.

11:01.687 --> 11:02.108
We're there.

11:02.990 --> 11:08.740
The basic technology infrastructure is solid and well supported.

11:08.720 --> 11:17.309
But what's changing so rapidly, the feeling of a revolution is how we actually use this technology in our lives.

11:19.011 --> 11:27.460
In Wired Magazine a couple years ago, Steve Steinberg wrote an essay about what's changed and what's happened in the last five years with digital technologies.

11:27.680 --> 11:33.867
And his conclusion, which he was wistful and regretful about, was that nothing much has happened.

11:34.184 --> 11:36.387
and felt that that was a cause for concern.

11:37.589 --> 11:44.077
But for those of us in libraries, archives, and museums, some sense of stability in this technology is a cause for optimism.

11:44.097 --> 11:50.406
And I think that Tim and others, even Walt, were talking about, we can count on certain things.

11:50.426 --> 11:53.670
Now, three years ago, we couldn't make that conversation.

11:53.730 --> 11:59.398
We were all worried about the ephemera of digital technology, but we have a certain room for optimism here now.

12:00.813 --> 12:11.633
okay now i need to begin looking ahead with preservation in some senses is about prediction and about lowering our risk george gilder who

12:12.203 --> 12:37.266
walt mentioned this morning uh we i could describe who george gilter is and i won't i won't do that but he he did write a nice essay in last week's new yorker or that he was described in last week's new york new yorker as being critical of most projectors most most prognosticators as being focused on catastrophe anybody that looks forward tends to see the worst and what the doomsmeers don't understand is that is that the reason humans revels creativity

12:37.617 --> 12:40.170
where that creativity always comes as a surprise.

12:40.190 --> 12:45.838
Now, we know that the World Wide Web has come over us as a surprise, even though it took 10, 15 years

12:46.223 --> 12:58.860
to think about it, figure it out, convince many people that he wasn't crazy, and build a base for a revolution that comes to us as a surprise.

12:58.880 --> 13:10.115
And I think that as we're looking forward to digital preservation, we have to remember that we're constantly surprising ourselves with our ability to deal with complicated issues.

13:10.195 --> 13:15.302
The second point, which should be obvious after half a morning of talking about this, is that the web is not a library.

13:15.991 --> 13:22.485
The web is not a library because the information is not all there, and I think we clarified that this morning.

13:23.066 --> 13:27.856
It's lacking standards and validation to name two of the things that are wrong with the World Wide Web.

13:28.477 --> 13:29.720
And there's minimal cataloging.

13:29.740 --> 13:33.207
We know that for a fact, or any kind of descriptive standards.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.003
And retrieval is still, for now, ineffective.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.006
I mean, with Google up there, only through Wall's web page is number one.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.848
It's still not quite there.

13:40.868 --> 13:44.432
And so my contention is that preservation is the job for libraries.

13:44.452 --> 13:46.634
And it's the job for archives, the job for museums.

13:47.135 --> 13:58.047
It's the job for organizations whose mission is to keep them for the good of somebody, the organization itself, or their reader, or their users, or society.

13:58.499 --> 14:03.344
And so we have a special job with preservation, and that job has always been a part of libraries.

14:03.504 --> 14:06.827
And Tim confirmed that this morning.

14:06.847 --> 14:11.152
He said, I'm hoping that you librarians out there will tell us all what to do.

14:11.953 --> 14:13.434
And I put a smile on my face.

14:13.454 --> 14:21.482
I don't know about you when he said that, because that's a validating power over what we have to do, which is figure out how to do this preservation thing.

14:23.164 --> 14:23.224
OK.

14:23.609 --> 14:31.140
So the question is, what's the place of preservation theory and practice in a world dominated by information created in the digital world?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.943
Big deal here.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.987
And the risk here is unbelievable investment.

14:36.007 --> 14:45.341
Anybody who's doing any budget work for your libraries, archives, or museums now know what the toll is for digital resources right now.

14:45.361 --> 14:47.263
There's still a pretty high risk loss.

14:48.565 --> 14:51.169
We haven't yet had, I'm waiting for the Florence plug.

14:52.229 --> 14:54.512
of the digital world.

14:54.532 --> 15:04.827
If you know anything about conservation, the Florence flood galvanized the conservation community to deal effectively with catastrophe among resources.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.472
We haven't had a Florence flood yet.

15:08.573 --> 15:13.039
And this world of constant product development, which makes us feel like we're in the midst of a chaotic world.

15:14.285 --> 15:20.875
Instead, what we're looking at is not the World Wide Web as something to preserve, but as digital libraries as something to build.

15:21.136 --> 15:25.402
And I'm using the word library broadly as an organization.

15:25.503 --> 15:28.026
This is Don Waters' definition.

15:28.087 --> 15:32.734
This sounds a lot like the definition of a regular library with a couple of exceptions.

15:32.754 --> 15:41.187
It's an organization that has resources, including specialized assets, does all these things, select, structure, offer intellectual access, interpret,

15:42.618 --> 15:54.150
resources, distribute, preserve the integrity of collections for digital works so that they're readily available and economically available for use by a defined community.

15:54.430 --> 15:59.516
Defined, it suggests choices we make about what our audience is.

15:59.536 --> 16:09.406
So what we're really looking at is building a product, and that's my point of departure for digital preservation.

16:09.426 --> 16:09.486
OK.

16:09.938 --> 16:12.462
Now, I probably have convinced you already.

16:12.502 --> 16:13.483
Oh, this is logical.

16:13.503 --> 16:14.164
Of course.

16:15.386 --> 16:17.969
That's what I'm here to do, is to make you say yes.

16:18.850 --> 16:20.653
But there's a debate out there.

16:20.673 --> 16:28.464
And what's that debate going on here?

16:28.484 --> 16:30.707
Maybe this is professional jealousy or something.

16:31.348 --> 16:35.153
Some people have had a few grandchildren.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.793
associated with digital preservation.

16:37.833 --> 16:41.176
And I want to tell you about a few of that in a few minutes here.

16:41.236 --> 16:42.917
First, some precedence.

16:43.858 --> 16:52.486
The idea of digital preservation, I think, has largely emerged not out of the library preservation community, but out of the archives community.

16:52.506 --> 17:04.937
Anybody who's thought or worried or taken a workshop in the 1980s about the problem of electronic records immediately understands what the basic problem is of digital material.

17:05.170 --> 17:24.973
And in the pre-1980s and up through the 1980s, there was a lot of work going on, a lot of angst, mostly, in the archives community about electronic records, which then became codified as a research agenda, prompted by people like Margaret Hedstrom, who's now at the University of Michigan, and then originally she was at the New York State Archives Program.

17:25.633 --> 17:31.380
Richard Cox, way preceding many of us, and thinking constructively about this, the National Archives,

17:31.613 --> 17:35.978
working off and on, in and out, all around the bush to get focused.

17:36.558 --> 17:44.707
Contracted with a number of people to do studies, including the National Association of Public Administrators, a major study for the National Archives.

17:44.747 --> 17:54.237
But it was pretty much under the light, was under the bushel until the ROG Commission on Preservation and Access Task Force on Archiving.

17:54.817 --> 17:58.161
The digital record came along in 1996, chaired by Don Waters,

17:58.613 --> 18:00.925
And John Garrett, who put a report together.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.674
It's listed in your handout.

18:02.694 --> 18:03.197
It's on the web.

18:03.398 --> 18:06.092
It'll be .

18:06.325 --> 18:10.372
And it clarified, it defined for us this idea of migration.

18:10.752 --> 18:14.939
It gave a vow to emulation without really giving it much due.

18:14.960 --> 18:31.928
And it focused on the need to focus on born digital materials primarily, perhaps at the expense of, in a limited world of limited resources, reborn digital, which I'm thinking of as all the stuff that we're sitting on in our institutions now.

18:32.043 --> 18:55.418
conversion of legacy collections into digital form and if tim you know we he we went back and forth over the grave whether he says anything important is going to be on the web maybe that's true in terms of managing our organizations but it's not true in terms of scholarship communication learning teaching and all the things that are bread and butter there's still a lot of work to do my focus when i

18:55.634 --> 19:02.959
I had the good fortune of reading a draft of the RLG CPA Task Force and realized that the reborn digital piece wasn't being discussed.

19:02.979 --> 19:07.956
I had the opportunity to write the preservation in the digital world, which I'm going to summarize in the next.

19:08.408 --> 19:15.178
And now we're seeing, all of a sudden, what I'm calling, you know, what we could think of is the new cottage industry on digital preservation.

19:15.258 --> 19:27.515
Everywhere you turn in the world of higher education, you have people, task forces groups, some talking to each other and some not, worrying about what we're going to do about digital preservation.

19:27.615 --> 19:34.365
And I think this is a wonderful thing, in fact, that we've got a high level of anxiety happening.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.369
Now, I had a 20,000-year time frame.

19:37.822 --> 20:03.441
preservation 10 000 in the past and 10 000 in the future here we have four orders of magnitude less 10 10 years we've had a tremendous amount of progress we should pat ourselves on that that we that the idea that we might want to have a preservation sensibility built into this digital arena was a new idea 10 years ago and it's virtually a clear concept now we can't do it yet but it's a clear concept

20:03.725 --> 20:11.234
We have a tremendous amount of research and development, both nationally and internationally, in all kinds of arenas, shared and unshared results.

20:11.595 --> 20:13.858
Best practices emerging for most kinds of materials.

20:13.918 --> 20:15.340
We know how to do text.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.165
We are pretty close to knowing how to do black and white photographs.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.166
We're getting there on color.

20:20.466 --> 20:22.028
We're getting there on oversized materials.

20:22.048 --> 20:24.832
We're not there on newspapers, yada, yada.

20:24.852 --> 20:29.057
There's a lot of people working on how to create digital resources.

20:29.493 --> 20:36.984
There's a tremendous amount of work going on, at least in the last couple years, on information architectures, which is all the underlying database structures that help ties all together.

20:37.745 --> 20:41.049
It's the nodes on the internet, and what happens when you land on one of those?

20:41.069 --> 20:42.311
What do you get?

20:42.371 --> 20:48.980
The architectures for these digital libraries are emerging with amazing speed in the last couple of years.

20:49.501 --> 20:55.049
Models for transformative digital products, we have wonderful resources out there that we can point to as successes so far.

20:55.069 --> 20:57.272
Ones that look like they will persist, JSTOR.

20:58.484 --> 21:08.069
the documenting the American Self Project at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, LC's American Memory Program.

21:08.089 --> 21:09.854
Not all of it is your tax dollars at work either.

21:09.874 --> 21:14.586
A lot of it is your former vacancy that went away to pay for a digital product.

21:15.005 --> 21:17.588
national leadership in the infrastructure.

21:17.608 --> 21:18.609
We have a voice.

21:18.649 --> 21:25.137
It's in the Council on Library and Information Resources and it's in the National Digital Library Federation voice.

21:25.197 --> 21:32.205
Now how effective that voice is and how stable that voice is is my next slide.

21:32.245 --> 21:38.633
The Council on Library and Information Resources is a co-joining of the old Council on Library Resources and the Commission on Reservation and Access.

21:39.305 --> 21:48.980
It became an entity in 1987, I believe, and has been a vocal advocate for preservation, both traditionally and in digital forms.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.709
But the message is morphing on us, and that's what I want to show you here.

21:54.809 --> 22:01.600
In 1997, the annual report for the first annual report for CLEAR said the digital surrogates are for access only.

22:02.086 --> 22:06.392
followed up by a report that said digitization addresses no serious preservation issues.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.234
And I am quoting out of context.

22:08.915 --> 22:17.367
And if Don and Waters and Abby Smith and Deanna Markham were sitting here, we would be having a dialogue.

22:17.768 --> 22:28.943
Don Waters was the one that quality is a metaphor, which I then turned around three weeks later and put that slide up that says, you know, the good news follows it.

22:28.963 --> 22:30.405
The doctor says it's only a metaphor.

22:30.385 --> 22:33.510
Permanence and authenticity are a good length.

22:33.650 --> 22:42.544
The focus on that line is that you can't possibly have preservation because the media isn't permanent and you can sneak in in the dead of night and change that digital file.

22:42.564 --> 22:46.710
I could remove myself from this presentation if I wanted to.

22:47.632 --> 22:53.541
But we have a new director of the Digital Library Federation, Dan Greenstein.

22:53.707 --> 23:02.235
who didn't come out of the United States world of digital politics, but came out of the English world of digital politics, which is probably no better or no worse than the American one.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.436
But he has a different perspective.

23:03.456 --> 23:10.442
He said the digital preservation thing is something we have to do, and the whole, it's so complex, but let's start close to home.

23:10.482 --> 23:14.526
Let's start with trying to preserve our own assets, the ones we created.

23:14.766 --> 23:17.548
Let's begin with preserving digital surrogates that we have created.

23:18.489 --> 23:21.672
And so in the course of only three years, we've gone full circle.

23:22.327 --> 23:24.329
And that's only three years.

23:26.292 --> 23:32.139
So, I'm back to... What is preservation?

23:32.359 --> 23:35.583
No, the manual is 99.

23:35.764 --> 23:44.394
I first hatched this idea in 96 and it became fully fleshed out in the latest edition of the NEDCC preservation manual.

23:44.414 --> 23:47.338
Preservation is the creation of digital products worth maintaining over time.

23:47.673 --> 23:55.721
And if you remember something from my presentation, take that sentence away, because it's loaded with assumptions, and it's loaded with requirements.

23:56.141 --> 23:56.942
It's not a metaphor.

23:56.962 --> 23:57.703
It's something we do.

23:58.103 --> 23:58.563
It's is.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.584
It's not is-like.

23:59.644 --> 24:11.516
The creation, all of a sudden, libraries, archives, and museums, we know this, but we have to face up to the fact that we're in the product creation business.

24:11.536 --> 24:13.037
Product creation business.

24:13.057 --> 24:15.299
Digital products worth maintaining over time.

24:15.319 --> 24:17.241
Value, if we don't add value,

24:17.558 --> 24:21.143
then we're not creating something worth maintaining over time.

24:21.223 --> 24:29.335
I'll mention, I'll go on a little bit about this in a minute, but the point here is that this creates a fairly high bar for us.

24:29.355 --> 24:34.943
That we're not simply copying material into another medium and calling it done and walking right away.

24:34.963 --> 24:41.533
We have to first transform our perspective on preservation in order to tackle the digital preservation issues.

24:42.074 --> 24:46.941
Our way of looking at traditional preservation must change from

24:49.216 --> 24:59.493
From locally to collaboration, so much of what we do is based on what's good for General Motors and Yale is good for General Motors and Yale, and the rest of us can follow.

25:00.315 --> 25:04.161
From standards to best practices and back again, and I rushed at lunch.

25:04.181 --> 25:12.355
I rushed upstairs and put the NBAC again in there in response to Tim Berners-Lee's comments about the place of standards.

25:12.807 --> 25:35.902
Those of us in the preservation and library and archives community have tended to walk away from standards because of the cumbersome standards process that takes 10 to 15 years to get something, a meta-standard, some big thing that's 400 page thick standards, whether it's archives records management in Australia or whatever, it's an impossible process.

25:36.202 --> 25:41.430
And we said the best that we can do is consensus on the way to do the job, which is what best practice is.

25:41.680 --> 25:49.370
What Tim has reminded us is that underneath that best practice are some basic things that we need to agree that we have to call standards.

25:49.550 --> 25:51.653
We wouldn't have the world wide world if there wasn't.

25:52.153 --> 25:55.778
Some minimal level of standardization is really what it's all about.

25:55.798 --> 26:00.184
So it's this combination of perhaps abandoning the broad-based standards process.

26:00.204 --> 26:09.055
It's not abandoning it, at least putting it on the backseat, emphasizing best practices for getting the job done, but recognizing that those best practices won't be best

26:09.727 --> 26:14.333
unless there's an underlying technology standard that backs them up.

26:14.634 --> 26:18.660
It's open systems standards, open software, etc.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.983
From product to product, I've belabored this one already.

26:22.325 --> 26:25.649
Most of our traditional preservation work has been fairly linear.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.594
We're looking at something more complex now.

26:28.614 --> 26:30.016
And we have rescued ownership.

26:31.337 --> 26:37.506
The preservation ethic embedded in the copyright laws of the United States and other countries allows preservation of anything.

26:38.498 --> 26:41.782
even whether it's owned by copyright or not, in the interest of preservation.

26:42.023 --> 26:52.397
But we now know with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that we can preserve something, but we can't make it available because we don't own it.

26:52.417 --> 26:58.224
For moral right to business plan, preservation was built on the fact that it was the right thing to do.

26:58.244 --> 27:02.811
But we're in an environment where business plans are going to make a difference, and so we have to have that.

27:02.831 --> 27:04.853
The product itself has to be transformed.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.438
Thinking of what we are doing with creating a digital product has to change.

27:09.464 --> 27:16.412
And what we've got is a set of relationships that starts with the reason we're doing this in the first place.

27:16.632 --> 27:22.539
Are we just trying to protect our materials from further damage by putting them online and putting the derivatives online?

27:22.939 --> 27:28.185
Are we trying to facilitate research interpretation by representing the information in those sources?

27:28.385 --> 27:36.214
Or, as I would suggest we really need to focus on, create applications that take maximum advantage by the technology itself, transcendent,

27:36.768 --> 27:42.335
applications that transform our way of doing business, that transform our way of learning and teaching.

27:43.557 --> 27:47.942
Once you've got that one down, then you worry about what stuff you're going to convert to.

27:47.962 --> 27:50.426
We've had some conversations about selection and choice.

27:51.787 --> 27:58.396
We tend to look first at content and then form and format genre, then the structure and how we put that together.

27:58.997 --> 28:02.421
All the pieces relate to each other and then what we're representing in digital form.

28:02.924 --> 28:12.175
If I had more time, the whole issue of representation in digital form is worth a 45-minute talk in itself, this transformative process in what we actually do.

28:12.215 --> 28:19.364
For instance, when you digitize a photograph, do you leave the border of the photograph on or off?

28:19.384 --> 28:20.566
Do you enhance the photograph?

28:20.926 --> 28:24.190
If it's a glass plate negative, do you take the crack out?

28:24.608 --> 28:25.309
We'll leave it in.

28:26.171 --> 28:33.303
This sounds like trivia, but it has to do with what we're trying to tell ourselves and others when we do our digital representation.

28:33.683 --> 28:41.056
There are tremendously complicated issues about representation in digital form that we have to work on collectively.

28:41.216 --> 28:43.139
But they go for these transcendent applications.

28:43.159 --> 28:47.426
And then finally, and only finally, do we get to the technology capabilities.

28:47.807 --> 28:50.211
All too often, the process goes in the other direction.

28:51.288 --> 28:57.898
We start with technology, sometimes because we're given a gift of technology, and say, okay, now what are we going to do?

28:57.918 --> 29:00.923
And then we sit down and say, what could we digitize and get on the web?

29:01.384 --> 29:04.950
And then you're already two years into the process, and you say, why are we doing this anyway?

29:07.974 --> 29:17.329
These relationships define quality and cost, and that they also influence selection, integrity, accessibility, which are the issues that I think that we're dealing with in preservation.

29:17.900 --> 29:22.488
Five basic core preservation factors have to inform the creation of our digital products.

29:26.175 --> 29:27.277
Concern about longevity.

29:27.438 --> 29:29.742
It's not about media, but it is about media.

29:29.982 --> 29:34.170
You have to store it someplace, in some file format, somewhere.

29:35.045 --> 29:39.129
So digital technology, in essence, is not media.

29:39.710 --> 29:40.811
But it is about media.

29:40.951 --> 29:43.114
And longevity storage systems are a major issue.

29:43.734 --> 29:51.363
Quality, which we've been focusing on for 10 years almost exclusively, is on image and text data quality.

29:51.383 --> 30:02.655
Fortunately, now our attention has shifted away from fretting over quality, because we can do it, to a concern for how we're going to describe this material in digital form.

30:02.973 --> 30:08.325
selection is always out there, and accessibility, or consistent functionality.

30:08.345 --> 30:14.840
And that's my setup for, this is the beginning of my setup for the next two talks.

30:14.860 --> 30:15.080
Okay.

30:16.884 --> 30:20.813
We're going to have two talks this afternoon.

30:20.995 --> 30:22.657
Let me go back one step.

30:22.677 --> 30:29.667
You'll notice that there are five core values that have to inform the building of our digital products.

30:30.008 --> 30:34.294
Longevity, quality, integrity, selection, and accessibility.

30:34.614 --> 30:39.541
What we're going to be hearing about this afternoon is largely about accessibility.

30:39.561 --> 30:41.684
And I think that that's an issue that we're going to want to look at.

30:42.485 --> 30:45.349
The other four are temporarily off the table.

30:46.848 --> 30:49.251
We have two alternative scenarios.

30:49.332 --> 30:53.818
Finette Eaton is going to talk about migration, and Jeff Rothenberg is going to talk about emulation.

30:53.838 --> 31:00.267
So I thought I'd provide a basic definition for each, and then move on to a bunch of issues that I think we have to think about.

31:00.287 --> 31:05.555
OK, this is from the Waters and Garrett Report from 1996, which is available online.

31:07.298 --> 31:15.910
Migration is a set of organized tasks, periodic transfer of digital materials, cross-target software platforms,

31:16.632 --> 31:20.918
and across technology generations and or across generations.

31:20.938 --> 31:21.739
It's prediction.

31:24.282 --> 31:30.891
Full functionality of the original object may or may not be preserved in this process.

31:30.911 --> 31:32.713
Emulation uses its software.

31:33.254 --> 31:45.930
It's to build a software package that deeply describes the software package that includes both the hardware, the capabilities of the hardware as well as the software and all the data.

31:46.619 --> 31:47.941
therein.

31:47.961 --> 31:56.511
Longevity is conferred, then, because you've made the issue of obsolescence go away.

31:56.531 --> 31:59.254
The original functionality and content are fixed.

31:59.274 --> 32:02.057
At least this is my understanding of that.

32:02.077 --> 32:04.380
I think Jeff might have something to say about that.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.202
OK, emulation, there's some pros and cons.

32:06.282 --> 32:07.444
I mean, there's some issues.

32:07.504 --> 32:10.547
Emulation tends to be a once and for all.

32:10.567 --> 32:13.791
Do it once and be done with it, which sounds kind of like preservation.

32:15.695 --> 32:26.728
With migration, there's periodic intervention, five years, seven years, 10 years, 15 years, when emulation fixes functions more or less in time.

32:26.848 --> 32:38.801
If you decide to emulate a WordStar 1.0 running on a leading edge computer with a 286 Intel chip inside of it, you fix WordStar 1.0.

32:39.282 --> 32:43.727
All the data that was created on WordStar 1.0, particularly picking an easy mark,

32:44.686 --> 32:53.157
What about the 1980 census that we want to emulate how the census is organized?

32:53.177 --> 33:01.527
So that in 300 years, we can read the 1980 census in all of its glory in electronic form.

33:01.708 --> 33:02.989
That's a harder mark.

33:03.009 --> 33:06.734
That's not so easy to shoot at.

33:06.794 --> 33:08.897
And emulation data tends to be fixed.

33:08.917 --> 33:11.520
There's a great potential that as you migrate, you lose something.

33:12.310 --> 33:14.773
There's a real possibility.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.096
Emulation emphasizes certainty.

33:17.136 --> 33:18.077
We want certainty.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.018
We want to sleep at night.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.600
We don't know what we're doing right now.

33:20.620 --> 33:23.042
Migration is a crack shoot.

33:23.062 --> 33:26.807
We don't know whether it's going to work.

33:26.827 --> 33:28.429
Emulation is independent of value and use.

33:28.889 --> 33:33.454
You don't have to care about what you're emulating because you're just doing it.

33:33.474 --> 33:40.022
Migration, because we can't save everything all the time forever, is completely dependent upon value and use.

33:41.808 --> 33:46.076
So my question, my first issue, my first question is, is technology the carbon source?

33:47.679 --> 33:48.520
Which is it?

33:48.821 --> 33:54.872
Does technology follow from what we want to do with our organizations?

33:54.892 --> 34:01.505
Or is it the driving force that helps us figure out what we're going to do with our organizations?

34:03.548 --> 34:03.809
Not in India.

34:03.829 --> 34:05.031
Okay, now we're on to some more issues.

34:09.803 --> 34:13.188
Okay, so this is a dog egg, making a hole.

34:13.328 --> 34:15.592
So I dig a hole, put the bone in the hole.

34:16.453 --> 34:18.696
What's my motivation for burying them?

34:18.716 --> 34:20.759
You can't bury them.

34:21.681 --> 34:25.026
Dogs just bury bones because they're programmed to bury bones.

34:25.046 --> 34:27.249
They don't need motivation, but we do.

34:27.269 --> 34:28.892
We need motivation.

34:28.912 --> 34:37.144
Okay, I've got a series of little quotes here, but I need my children in order to complete this.

34:42.760 --> 34:47.532
David Levy was at Xerox Park for the longest time.

34:47.572 --> 34:52.283
He's not there anymore, but he's got his own company doing consulting.

34:52.303 --> 35:00.583
But David Levy wrote a classic article that I think is classic, that I quoted in the Blue Bibliography, in which he

35:00.563 --> 35:06.331
He critiques a kind of techno-centric approach to our concern for preservation.

35:06.551 --> 35:11.978
It's that we become so fixed on the artifacts that we've lost sight of their users and their use.

35:12.078 --> 35:19.147
Items that are digital collections that are not used probably will not persist.

35:19.167 --> 35:22.732
It's an important issue to keep in mind as you go forward.

35:23.513 --> 35:24.915
There's a political statement here.

35:25.836 --> 35:30.402
The idea that unused materials will not survive.

35:31.073 --> 35:48.256
implies, it challenges the foundation of a research library or a research archive that's in the business of collecting materials so that one of these days they hope they'll be used or they will be used or they're discovered by another generation of scholars way down the road.

35:48.557 --> 35:57.469
So we could fixate on that mission challenging statement or we could just get over it and get on with measuring use.

35:57.955 --> 36:02.541
We've shied away from systems, building systems that track users in use.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.163
There's a confidentiality issue.

36:04.503 --> 36:06.405
There's a lot of things about use.

36:06.425 --> 36:09.169
And then there's the issue of the quality of use and the quantity of use.

36:09.189 --> 36:10.430
It's easy to count.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.733
It's not so easy to measure.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.175
Does use make a difference?

36:14.195 --> 36:16.318
Are people writing their seminal articles?

36:16.498 --> 36:25.549
Are they getting through sixth grade as a result of having the American memory learning page there in front of them?

36:26.018 --> 36:29.486
So significant use is not necessarily a value judgment.

36:29.587 --> 36:30.750
It doesn't emphasize Ph.D.

36:30.770 --> 36:32.935
research over sixth grade term papers.

36:32.955 --> 36:38.168
It just says, can we understand the fact that there is sixth grade term papers out there and Ph.D.

36:38.388 --> 36:42.458
programs as well, or is it just eight counts through a website?

36:43.417 --> 36:59.305
But my assertion is that at least where we stand now, with the shape of digital standards, with the shape of understanding what we do and how we do it, we have to build a product that will be used.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.029
Because if they aren't, we can't justify their existence.

37:02.049 --> 37:04.193
And that's a tough one.

37:04.679 --> 37:10.427
That's a tough message, I think, and you may too disagree in the end, but I haven't understood the alternative myself.

37:11.048 --> 37:15.775
Okay, the second thing is that certainty is a continuum.

37:18.259 --> 37:25.970
The longer we go out, let's think a hundred years out, and the latest thinking on digital presentations is let's build systems with a hundred year time frame.

37:26.571 --> 37:30.957
And the interesting take on this is the idea that

37:32.303 --> 37:38.252
Preservation used to be into what I used to think of as generational handoff.

37:38.473 --> 37:45.784
I administer a collection and do the best I can and hand it on to my successors, more or less at the point of my retirement.

37:46.184 --> 37:47.847
In other words, generational change.

37:48.248 --> 37:56.320
What we're trying to do is the best we could within a 30, 40, 50 year time frame and then hand it off for our successors who we have trained to come in behind us.

37:56.553 --> 37:57.615
and pick up where we at.

37:57.695 --> 37:58.957
It's a generational handle.

37:59.358 --> 38:01.582
Now the word generation means a five-year computer.

38:02.984 --> 38:07.191
Generation migration, when we talk about multiple generations, we're talking about five years.

38:07.893 --> 38:12.601
If I'm around to see it, that means I have to migrate four or five or six or seven or eight times.

38:12.621 --> 38:19.012
The point of this slide is that we can't necessarily be completely logical about this.

38:19.032 --> 38:20.755
But we can see out four to five years

38:21.190 --> 38:22.251
and do the best we can.

38:22.932 --> 38:28.938
But we have to count on this creativity that Gilder keeps talking about as the solution for things.

38:28.958 --> 38:32.562
And it's not an excuse to wash your hands and walk away from a problem.

38:32.642 --> 38:39.009
It's do the best you can within a reasonable time frame and count on human creativity to carry the day.

38:39.029 --> 38:42.733
Now that's a way overly optimistic view for most of you.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.757
But that's what we're on.

38:45.857 --> 38:50.742
But coupled with this is this sense of the inevitability of loss.

38:51.110 --> 38:58.179
An optical disc is not an organic item, but ashes to ashes and dust to dust, all organic materials.

38:58.739 --> 39:02.004
And basically everything out there is in a state of deterioration.

39:02.024 --> 39:05.007
And this goes back to use again.

39:05.027 --> 39:08.872
The way to do this is exercise.

39:08.892 --> 39:11.655
Stuart Brandt, he's the father of the Whole Earth Catalog.

39:12.156 --> 39:14.799
If you're over 40, you probably remember the Whole Earth Catalog.

39:14.819 --> 39:17.042
If you're under, you don't.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.345
Stuart has now moved on to the internet.

39:19.578 --> 39:23.528
and went away from the whole earth catalog.

39:23.548 --> 39:29.242
And he wrote that the solution for persistent works is .

39:31.708 --> 39:33.132
But that we have to recognize

39:33.770 --> 39:52.420
Somewhere in here, I put this upbeat kind of statement from Stuart Brand in this talk, but the real point here is that an awful lot of material isn't going to survive and that the sooner we can kind of set ourselves up to understand how we want to think about loss as we move through these systems, migration processes and emulation processes.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.126
We can't build an emulator for everything, no more than we can migrate everything.

39:56.146 --> 39:59.271
So we better kind of figure out how to measure, how to decide

39:59.504 --> 40:03.570
And it's not selection for preservation, it's selection for loss in a lot of ways.

40:03.590 --> 40:11.500
That's the harder to say goodbye to someone that you might have your heart into at one point.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.542
Elaboration is unavoidable.

40:14.384 --> 40:20.753
Stanley Tudorov, who's a manipulist,

40:21.121 --> 40:28.918
has written a number of works about the way that scholarship and teaching and learning and libraries worked in the medieval era.

40:29.038 --> 40:41.205
And his key point, which I pulled just a glimmering one little piece of his argument out of here, is that the idea of the author, the idea of owned intellectual property, is a relatively modern

40:42.839 --> 40:47.946
And what his point is, is that we may be in an opportunity to move away from that.

40:47.966 --> 40:55.956
The digital technology gives us a way to go back to the old way, in which it was all about the content and interpretation of that content.

40:56.477 --> 41:03.486
Monks working in an abbey would take a sacred text, and they would pray about it, and they would study it, and they would write in the margins.

41:03.506 --> 41:08.713
And 300 years later, by the time that thing had been copied two or three times, the marginality becomes part of the text.

41:10.155 --> 41:11.597
The interpretation becomes...

41:12.100 --> 41:18.471
the text, and you build text collaboratively and iteratively over a fairly long period of time.

41:18.551 --> 41:22.497
It's this annotation function that we've been talking about earlier.

41:22.678 --> 41:33.356
And the digital world gives us this possibility to refocus ourselves on the text and not on the producers of that text or the writers of that text, but on the text itself.

41:33.376 --> 41:37.703
And I'm using text generically to talk about any kind of information resource.

41:37.683 --> 41:42.574
And it's beginning to close again in the Middle Ages.

41:42.594 --> 41:44.498
And that's another source for optimism.

41:44.618 --> 41:56.063
As long as we think that we have to fix something in time in order for it to be preserved, we've talked ourselves out of the potential for digital preservation.

41:56.667 --> 42:05.697
Again, David Levy writes in this article, he said all information sources are fixed and fluid.

42:05.777 --> 42:09.622
Sometimes they're fixed and sometimes they're undergoing a state of change.

42:10.042 --> 42:14.908
And the issue for him is a matter of time, not state.

42:14.928 --> 42:17.491
So everything is undergoing change all the time.

42:17.511 --> 42:21.375
And the more that we can deal with that and not become fixated on fixation,

42:22.368 --> 42:28.899
fixing things either on a media or authentication or trustworthiness.

42:28.919 --> 42:42.143
If we separate ourselves from that and begin looking at this technology for what it can do for us, then we're back again to building digital products that are seductively attractive to the audience that we serve.

42:42.163 --> 42:46.350
And through that seduction process, we get a resource worth keeping.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.189
And then it becomes a technical problem.

42:50.950 --> 42:53.293
I want you to say yes when you walk out the door.

42:53.413 --> 43:01.222
And so I'm not trying to scare you away with all the complexities and file formats and bit streams and metadata standards.

43:01.242 --> 43:13.958
Because my thinking is that when you look at the progress that's been made in the last five to 10 years, thinking about what we can do in five years and just put this on our agenda, it's something that we're not going to turn away from and deny is irrelevant.

43:14.225 --> 43:22.477
Because I don't want to ever hear again, which I hear almost every day, I'm not interested in digitization for preservation.

43:22.497 --> 43:25.501
I'm only interested in access.

43:25.521 --> 43:31.590
We don't want our responsibility as cultural heritage preservation.

43:31.610 --> 43:37.859
And to say that we're only interested in access to me says, well, finally, I have a technology that can get people in the door.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.765
Because they haven't been visiting me, so at least they can click on me.

43:41.905 --> 43:43.708
And I can validate myself.

43:44.127 --> 43:44.708
through you.

43:45.589 --> 43:56.224
And so promoting yourself as building digital collections to enhance access is really a fundamental denial of what you're really about, which is building collections for time.

43:57.365 --> 44:03.013
So with that in mind, I'll give you my last little

44:03.567 --> 44:10.951
Instead of waiting for the next big thing to transform our lives, why don't we give it a shot?

44:10.971 --> 44:11.152
No?

44:11.794 --> 44:14.202
Yes?

44:42.211 --> 44:49.061
who is Director of Technical Services at the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

44:49.081 --> 44:54.408
She joined the Smithsonian to establish an electronic records program in their archives.

44:54.428 --> 45:09.489
Previously, she has served as Chief of Technical Service Branch Center for Electronic Records at the National Archives and Records Administration, NARA, where she was responsible for developing a preservation program for electronic records created by federal agencies.

45:10.070 --> 45:11.492
No mean tests.

45:13.278 --> 45:23.271
Other works include experiences in archives in the National Archives, including positions in the Office of Presidential Libraries and the Document Standard Staff.

45:23.992 --> 45:29.420
She has presented papers and is the author of articles on preservation of electronic records in the National Archives.

45:30.141 --> 45:41.496
She was selected as a fellow at the Society of American Archivists in 1950, 1995, and received... Okay, 1995.

45:41.813 --> 45:50.601
and received the IAC-IRM Technology Excellence Award in 1996 for designing the Archival Preservation System at NARA.

45:51.402 --> 45:52.283
She has a B.A.

45:52.323 --> 45:52.963
and an M.A.

45:52.983 --> 46:03.493
in History from the University of Maryland and attended the Nagara Advanced Institute for Government Archivist on Archival Administration in the Electronic Information Agency.

46:03.894 --> 46:06.476
And that was in Pittsburgh, 1992 and 1993.

46:07.917 --> 46:10.740
And at the National Defense University,

46:11.716 --> 46:21.186
uh in washington dc and the iron college for advanced management program in 1997. i give you an adeaton on migration as a reservation

46:40.893 --> 46:58.116
I have a terrible tendency to have my tongue through my mouth.

46:58.136 --> 47:08.470
I want to thank Nelanet, NEDCC, and the Kennedy Library for inviting me to come and talk to you about the preservation of electronic records.

47:09.648 --> 47:11.650
This almost feels like a homecoming for me.

47:12.871 --> 47:21.620
As I was noted in my introduction, I was a member of the Office of Presidential Library staff for more than seven years before becoming involved in electronic records.

47:22.480 --> 47:26.464
Some of my happiest memories come from my work with residential libraries.

47:29.127 --> 47:37.495
One of the more striking aspects of electronic records is the importance, almost the imperative,

47:38.032 --> 47:47.646
of providing clear definitions to words that are used to explain issues associated with electronic records.

47:47.666 --> 47:58.322
Words that have a variety of meanings are used by different communities with little or no understanding of how differently they are perceived by the other signs.

47:59.724 --> 48:04.090
As an archivist, and this is where I get to play with,

48:04.964 --> 48:11.713
As an archivist, one of my favorite misunderstandings is between archive and archiving.

48:12.895 --> 48:26.593
To most archivists, archive first and foremost is a noun denoting either the records of an organization or the institution responsible for preserving records.

48:26.613 --> 48:34.684
Charles Dahmer is even more specific when he postulates that archivists use the word archive, I quote, to designate

48:35.238 --> 48:51.660
a facility or building where specialists trained in archival procedures ensure that inactive records created by an organization are stored and protected from neglect and damage and are made available for research purposes."

48:51.680 --> 49:01.093
To a technologist, archiving is clearly a verb indicating a process of moving active records to an inactive status.

49:01.529 --> 49:06.274
without any judgment as to the value of the information being moved.

49:06.294 --> 49:29.578
As a facilitator in a workshop, working together, developed by the Coalition for Networked Information, which offers the opportunity for archivists and technologists from the same institution to work together to develop projects to deal with electronic record issues, I have directly witnessed the great divide between these two groups and the words archives, archiving.

49:33.085 --> 49:45.800
What I would like to do in my allotted time this afternoon is discuss the terminology, what is meant when authors use the words copying, refreshing, recopying, and migration in discussing electronic records.

49:45.820 --> 49:59.076
I will then describe the process that the National Archives and Records Administration has used for making preservation copies of electronic records, including the recopying of files to new media, and NARA's first step

49:59.309 --> 50:07.321
in dealing with capturing the logical and contextual structure of the more complex records being created by federal agencies today.

50:08.282 --> 50:26.970
The third portion of my talk will describe an international research project in APARES which is seeking to determine the best way to ensure the preservation of authentic records over time, the research efforts that are underway at San Diego Supercomputer Center to develop

50:27.338 --> 50:30.222
a collection-based persistent digital art.

50:30.242 --> 50:31.383
I'm so intrigued.

50:31.583 --> 50:34.447
Persistent seems to be the word that's now being used.

50:34.507 --> 50:35.849
It's very interesting.

50:36.590 --> 50:39.433
I've only heard it for the last six months, but that seems to be the new N word.

50:40.675 --> 50:53.291
And the open archival information system, which is defining a conceptual framework for archival systems dedicated to preserving and maintaining access to electronic digital records over time.

50:54.993 --> 50:55.894
Charles Dollar,

50:56.144 --> 51:11.999
In his groundbreaking paper, Archival Theory and Practices in Informatics, Some Considerations, the University of Maserata in 1990, had interesting ideas about what was meant by permanence.

51:12.059 --> 51:12.760
I'm gonna quote him.

51:13.601 --> 51:26.033
The notion of permanence, at least in the United States, is by no means an absolute, as over time the meaning of permanence has ranged between the permanence of the information and documents

51:26.435 --> 51:30.199
to the permanent of the physical objects themselves."

51:30.939 --> 51:37.045
In the 18th and 19th century, printing of multiple copies was seen as a method of preserving information.

51:38.006 --> 51:47.315
In the 20th century, technological development aroused hope that the usable lifetime of documents could be extended indefinitely.

51:47.335 --> 51:56.323
Accordingly, permanent retention came to mean the physical extension of the usable life of originals for an unlimited period of time.

51:57.265 --> 52:16.666
The inherent technological obsolescence of electronic media and the high cost of preserving the useful life of archival records undermine the concept of permanent retention, not just for electronic records, but for all special media requiring technology for access.

52:17.347 --> 52:26.277
About a month ago, I was interviewed by CNN, and what they were really doing was looking at film and video, particularly the home movies.

52:26.527 --> 52:28.370
And they do in electronic records as well.

52:28.971 --> 52:36.762
And I think it's interesting that I think there's more concern in the wider community for the home movies rather than electronic.

52:36.802 --> 52:41.409
And I'm hoping in about five more years, there'll be the electronic information that will be of concern.

52:42.972 --> 52:52.987
Periodic re-copying of electronic records to ensure migration from old technologies to new technologies mitigates the effects of technology obsolescence.

52:53.928 --> 52:55.150
But what are the costs

52:55.619 --> 53:00.184
And how feasible is this process for organizations?

53:00.204 --> 53:12.999
There has been a growing awareness of the critical danger our society is facing with the loss of electronic information records because of both the fragility of the magnetic media and the obsolescence of the technology.

53:14.001 --> 53:18.906
A number of important studies have documented the problems of preserving electronic information.

53:20.228 --> 53:23.652
We have this conference looking at the various options

53:23.952 --> 53:26.875
preserving digital information for instance, for example.

53:28.317 --> 53:32.982
Most of my experience has been with the transfer of information from older to newer media.

53:33.983 --> 53:37.567
According to Margaret Hedstrom, this is usually termed refreshing.

53:38.888 --> 53:53.925
Peter Lyman and Howard Besser, in their background paper for Time and Bits, Managing Digital Continuity, sponsored by the Getty Institute, acknowledged that refreshing strategies, the practice of moving bits,

53:54.395 --> 54:02.466
to a new storage, physical storage medium is well understood by those who maintain backup files and large quantities of data.

54:03.788 --> 54:06.912
Another term that is often used in this context is copying.

54:07.733 --> 54:24.216
The key objective is to maintain the readability of the information by transferring them from old storage media, such as nine-track tape, to new storage media, CD-ROM, with the same format specifications, number of tracks or ASCII representations,

54:24.618 --> 54:29.523
without any substantive law in structure, content, and context.

54:30.564 --> 54:38.813
The difficulty arises with proprietary file formats that may not be readable by future applications.

54:38.833 --> 54:52.387
My husband, an historian, has written several books ranging from the Baltimore Orioles, to the Italian Socialist Party, to U.S.-Italian foreign relations from 1940 to 1950, to the city of Florence as a living museum.

54:52.868 --> 54:54.169
That's soon to come out.

54:54.841 --> 55:04.351
He wrote his first book using a paper computer, and Paul, I'm going to use WordStar too, it's a great example, with WordStar as a word processing software.

55:05.652 --> 55:07.534
The book was published more than 10 years ago.

55:07.554 --> 55:16.744
As we moved to new computers, he staunchly maintained that he needed to keep his first computer in case he needed access to one of his chapters.

55:16.764 --> 55:23.751
Well, last year, he decided he wanted to summarize one of his chapters for a class he was teaching, so he turned

55:23.933 --> 55:24.774
on the computer.

55:25.374 --> 55:35.023
It ran, but when he tried to insert, when he inserted the identified disk app, because with Caprush he hadn't had the disk app, he could not access the text.

55:35.704 --> 55:36.705
Does this sound familiar?

55:37.866 --> 55:44.552
Fortunately, he had also moved the text to WordPerfect, which had been our second word processing software version.

55:45.293 --> 55:51.999
Although he had to make some minor changes when he moved the text from WordStar to WordPerfect, he felt it was a good transfer of the file.

55:52.819 --> 55:53.400
Clearly,

55:53.785 --> 56:02.797
The issue of what is lost when moving to another software platform will depend upon the type of document one is using.

56:04.600 --> 56:07.824
Migration is one of those terms that conveys several meanings.

56:08.685 --> 56:23.185
Margaret Hedstrom and Sheila Montgomery in their December 1998 report, Digital Preservation Needs and Requirements and RLG member institutions, defined migration as the periodic transfer of digital materials

56:23.536 --> 56:31.865
from one hardware or software configuration to another, or from one generation of computer technology to a subsequent generation.

56:34.849 --> 56:50.927
Preserving digital information, report of the Task Force on Archiving Digital Information, which Paul just talked about, defined migration as ensuring that present and future users can retrieve, display, and otherwise use electronic materials

56:51.177 --> 56:53.960
in the face of constantly changing technology.

56:55.622 --> 57:15.883
Terrell Stoller, in his new book, Authentic Electronic Records, Strategies for Long-Term Access, narrows the definition by focusing on the issue that these records come from legacy information systems that lack export software functionality, which currently requires writing special purpose code or programs.

57:17.605 --> 57:21.049
I would like to mention one additional term, conversion.

57:21.822 --> 57:38.324
Charles Beller characterizes conversion as the automatically exporting or importing records from one software environment to another with little or no loss in structure and no loss in content or context, even though the underlying bit stream is altered.

57:40.247 --> 57:51.542
As should be obvious to you after my brief synopsis of various terms used for describing the issues facing archivists and librarians in preserving electronic records, digital information,

57:52.079 --> 58:05.512
There are a variety of words to describe the types of activities that need to occur, yet there are very few examples of actual experience in preserving electronic information over time.

58:12.899 --> 58:21.327
At this point, I'd like to move to my second topic in my presentation, the preservation activities with electronic records that have evolved over time

58:21.728 --> 58:24.111
at the National Archives.

58:24.131 --> 58:39.170
NARA has had a program for accessioning, describing, preserving, and providing reference service to the electronic, but they first called machine readable records, created by federal agencies and transferred to NARA for more than 30 years.

58:39.991 --> 58:50.605
The emphasis in preservation activities was on moving the files, in most cases recorded in ASCII or EBCDEC, that were flat files onto new media, in effect,

58:50.872 --> 58:53.095
moving the files to standard media.

58:54.817 --> 59:05.409
During the 1970s, all computer processing required by what was then called the Machine Readable Archives Division was performed at service bureaus.

59:06.090 --> 59:14.680
The division had an IBM 29 key punch, which the staff used to punch cards for the program to copy or dump tapes.

59:15.521 --> 59:18.124
The program card deck was wrapped in a rubber band.

59:18.144 --> 59:18.685
I love this.

59:19.205 --> 59:28.635
along with the sheet of instructions to the service bureau indicating which tape volumes were to be used for input and output and any other special instructions.

59:28.655 --> 59:35.762
The card deck, instructions, input tape, and blank output tapes were boxed and sent by courier to the service bureau.

59:36.563 --> 59:47.895
During this period, the original agency tapes were kept as the master tape and the NARS created tape became the reference copy to be used as input tape to make copies for researchers.

59:49.242 --> 59:57.915
Beginning in 1981, the Machine Readable Archives Division acquired, on loan, a dumb terminal.

59:58.175 --> 01:00:00.859
For those of you who are young, most of this is not going to make any sense.

01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:03.322
For those of us who are over 40, all of this makes sense.

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:11.634
They got a dumb terminal so that staff would run some jobs for the FBI appraisal task force.

01:00:12.315 --> 01:00:15.780
Another court case that severely strained NARA's resources.

01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:18.304
NARA seems to make the news when it's involved in court cases.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:22.500
And this was connected to the National Institutes of Health.

01:00:23.242 --> 01:00:32.978
The division took advantage of the access to this computer center to perform some of its normal copy and dump jobs at NIH, rather than at a service bureau.

01:00:33.559 --> 01:00:38.588
For a period during the 1980s, another office within the National Archives took over functions

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:42.153
of preserving during the preservation work.

01:00:42.614 --> 01:00:49.902
But in 1985, the machine-readable branch assumed full responsibility for preservation copying of a succession file.

01:00:50.643 --> 01:00:55.869
Within a few months, the branch obtained additional terminals for submitting jobs to the computer center.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:01:02.076
The computer center served as the computer resource for all of the branch's requirements.

01:01:03.898 --> 01:01:09.064
This mainframe computer center used IBM machines, so the types of outputs that could be

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.715
produced were limited to the options that were available at that center.

01:01:13.676 --> 01:01:22.868
In addition, the file formats that could be accepted for transfer were limited to those formats that could be processed at this site.

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:34.624
Knowledge requirements, which were published in the Code of Federal Regulations, stated that agencies were to transfer permanent computer files in a hardware and software independent format.

01:01:34.644 --> 01:01:38.950
Specifically, the files were to be written on half-inch magnetic tape

01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:56.194
and Epsi-Jek-Vorasky without internal control characters on seven or nine track open reel magnetic tape, recorded at 800, 1600, or 6250 bytes per inch, or in 3480 tape cartridges, and blocks not higher than 32,000 bytes.

01:01:56.214 --> 01:02:00.841
Giving you all those technical attributes to show that it was based on a mainframe computer.

01:02:01.642 --> 01:02:07.249
These requirements clearly reflect the use of a mainframe computer in the creation of preservation copies of those files.

01:02:07.752 --> 01:02:11.897
And it meant that NARA lost control of this tape by sending them out to the computer center.

01:02:12.698 --> 01:02:25.874
There had been some requirements over time to this work, including requiring a bite-to-bite comparison of every file that was copied to ensure that an exact duplicate was created in the copying process.

01:02:27.736 --> 01:02:37.067
One of the first priorities enunciated by the new director, Ken Thibodeau, when he joined what became the Center for Electronic Records in the winter of 1989,

01:02:37.402 --> 01:02:46.355
was to re-engineer this process by developing an in-house capability for making preservation copies of electronic files sent to the center by agencies.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:53.586
It was clear that the number of files copied using the computer center were far too low.

01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:59.574
We copied about 200 files a year once the center began its accelerated accessioning program.

01:03:00.616 --> 01:03:06.244
By examining the processes associated with producing preservation copies of electronic files,

01:03:06.595 --> 01:03:16.328
The staff developed a statement of work that defined the basic requirements and outlined additional features that would improve the process or the life of the contract.

01:03:16.989 --> 01:03:24.399
Although in the statement of work we defined what the processes should be, we did not define how they should be accomplished.

01:03:24.419 --> 01:03:27.143
There were four objectives with this contract.

01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:32.350
First, NARA wanted to retain control of the media and perform the work in-house.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:37.471
streamlining and saving valuable time and therefore increasing productivity.

01:03:38.533 --> 01:03:46.425
Second, the staff wanted the ability to handle a wider variety of file formats from agencies and produce standardized output.

01:03:47.426 --> 01:03:59.264
Third, the agency wanted to capture automatically from the processing of the files the technical attributes of the file such as the logical record length, block size, character code, and media.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:00.666
In effect,

01:04:00.882 --> 01:04:09.233
Contracts sought to automate the collection of technical description during the processing rather than entering this information into a separate database.

01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:17.504
Fourth, NARA wanted to increase the types of media that could be accepted from agencies and as well increase the types of output media.

01:04:19.948 --> 01:04:26.316
Fuller Media, the successful contractor, began developing the software, which was the largest component of the contract.

01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:39.756
It had been Nora's intention to develop a system operated for a certain period of time and it performed as expected to purchase additional systems as money permitted to increase the efficiency copying files.

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:47.506
However, we did not anticipate purchasing additional systems even before the software was developed.

01:04:49.049 --> 01:04:51.131
Life overtook plans.

01:04:54.636 --> 01:04:56.218
On January 19th,

01:04:56.637 --> 01:05:17.499
1989, the last day of the Reagan administration, Scott Armstrong, among others, filed Freedom of Information Act FOIA request for information stored on the computer system in the offices of the president from a state of installation in 1985 until the end of the Reagan administration.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.463
They sued the government, including the National Archives,

01:05:21.933 --> 01:05:29.504
asking for the court to declare many of the materials on the system to be federal and presidential records.

01:05:32.108 --> 01:05:42.803
Probably for most of you, you don't realize that, I would say even today, many federal agencies, if you say email is a record, they'll look at you blindly.

01:05:43.564 --> 01:05:44.806
They don't think that.

01:05:44.826 --> 01:05:47.890
This court decided that, but for most,

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:55.969
Particularly at that time, and even today, they do the technology as a tool, but not as a creator of actual records.

01:05:58.132 --> 01:06:11.471
Until the issues could be resolved, the court ordered the government not to destroy or alter any of the system's backup computer tapes, since they contained the only exact copy of some of the information on the system.

01:06:12.312 --> 01:06:16.037
The lawsuits carried on throughout the Bush administration.

01:06:17.553 --> 01:06:25.403
And the reason for the interest in these tapes, I always refer to it as the Iran-Contra controversy.

01:06:26.324 --> 01:06:34.373
The papers that Oliver North was so proud of tearing up was on the back of tapes, and this is what they were trying to get at.

01:06:35.815 --> 01:06:46.328
On the day after the reaction, when Bush was defeated, the plaintiffs extended the lawsuit to include materials residing on the computer systems in the Bush White House as well.

01:06:46.983 --> 01:06:59.395
On January 6, 1993, two weeks before Bush formally left office, the court ruled that some materials on the White House computer system were federal records and presidential records.

01:07:00.076 --> 01:07:14.610
And the courts directed the government, specifically the archivist of the United States, to take all necessary steps to preserve without erasure all electronic federal records generated by the White House agencies.

01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:22.725
The archives took physical custody of all the tapes from the White House as the Bush administration was leaving and the Clinton administration took office.

01:07:23.386 --> 01:07:42.214
In late May, the court ruled that the archives had not complied with this order to preserve the tapes, found the archives in a state of civil contempt, and levied fines which would amount to $2.5 million if the archives did not come into compliance within 30 days.

01:07:43.255 --> 01:07:44.597
While the fines were lifted,

01:07:44.662 --> 01:07:51.210
upon appeal, it was apparent that the threat of fines and possible imprisonment was very real.

01:07:52.551 --> 01:08:07.449
Unfortunately, the Center for Electronic Records became involved in this case when, in March 1993, the then acting archivist, Trudy Huskamp-Peterson, transferred the responsibility for preserving these computer backup tapes to the center.

01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:14.517
While the archival preservation system had been conceptualized to expedite routine

01:08:15.037 --> 01:08:16.699
preservation processing.

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:23.409
The center had to use it first in the very non-routine processing of materials from the White House.

01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:42.597
Responding to the crisis situation, the APS contractor, Mueller Media, compiled enough software to staff with the requisite clearances, and I mean security clearances because we were dealing with very highly classified information, were able to make duplicate copies of files in most cases.

01:08:43.403 --> 01:09:11.588
encountered problems copying some of the files and noted any problems but we complied with the court orders and successfully avoided legal sanctions over the next two years more than 5900 tapes and or cartridges were copied using one or more versions of the article preservation system software the center was able to copy more than 99.998 percent of the media transferred from the white house out of

01:09:11.855 --> 01:09:17.423
5,906 items, only 29 unique items had a data error.

01:09:18.205 --> 01:09:22.130
And what makes this even more interesting is we're talking, these were backup tapes.

01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:24.434
These were not tapes that were used for preservation copy.

01:09:24.474 --> 01:09:27.899
These are tapes that were rewritten over every two weeks.

01:09:29.722 --> 01:09:41.119
As I said, the contract was not completed as soon as we anticipated because we had to make adjustments to the ABS system to enable the center to meet requirements of the court order for preserving the backup file.

01:09:41.605 --> 01:10:02.618
To give you an idea of the problems that had to be overcome in processing these backup tapes from a variety of computer systems at the White House, many cases of tapes had been written over, since they were used for weekly backup, so that when the attempt to copy the files, there was information beyond the tape form, which meant that we did not get a normal end-of-file mark to cease copying operation.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:08.828
We were not able to determine what some of the problems were until we obtained greater functionality with the system.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:14.378
With the Bush cartridges, our greatest problem was the fact the backup utility had also used compression.

01:10:15.039 --> 01:10:19.765
So the APS system had to be modified so it could make duplicate copies of compressed files.

01:10:20.727 --> 01:10:27.236
Under our normal operating procedures, data in compressed format did not conform to NARA transfer regulations.

01:10:28.617 --> 01:10:36.368
Without APS, the National Archives could not possibly have met the requirements set by support duplicating all of the backup tapes

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:40.557
That's ensuring preservation of whatever was found on those tapes.

01:10:40.577 --> 01:10:45.783
The National Archives began processing normal files in APS in the fall of 1994.

01:10:46.403 --> 01:10:54.332
Through the end of fiscal year 1999, the Centers copied over 87,000 accession files using the system.

01:10:54.352 --> 01:10:59.157
It enabled NARA to handle a wider variety of file formats.

01:10:59.177 --> 01:11:03.942
One example is the 1990 Senate Census public use sample files from the Bureau of Assent.

01:11:04.765 --> 01:11:16.196
Although they are in a format that was hardware and software independent, user labels and the blocking factor used with these records prevents the center from being able to process these at the NIH Computer Center.

01:11:17.598 --> 01:11:25.766
Perhaps even more importantly, the APS provides the center with a mechanism to accept files on a wider variety of media.

01:11:26.727 --> 01:11:32.292
Using the NIH mainframe, there were two choices, 9-track tape or 3480 class cartridge.

01:11:32.778 --> 01:11:36.322
APS has those options, but other types of drives could be added as needed.

01:11:36.902 --> 01:11:40.126
One of the first was the CD-ROM drive to produce reference copies.

01:11:40.827 --> 01:11:50.377
For the classified profs files, for example, we had to install both a four millimeter and eight millimeter drive because some of the files we received were reported on that type of media.

01:11:52.239 --> 01:12:02.650
The archival preservation system provides a mechanism for transferring electronic records from media used by records creators to a media chosen specifically for archival preservation.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:26.329
writing archival copies of physical files in conformance with standard specifications for physical recording and labeling of the physical files, automatically tracking the media volume it writes, and by anticipating the obsolescence of digital media, facilitating the eventual transfer of physical files to a new preservation media.

01:12:26.349 --> 01:12:33.598
APS provided a foundation for the preservation of electronic records by physically preserving the zeros and ones.

01:12:34.203 --> 01:12:41.753
To preserve electronic records, it's also necessary to preserve the logical and conceptual structure of records.

01:12:41.773 --> 01:12:44.277
And this is closer to the definition of migration.

01:12:45.499 --> 01:12:59.117
Since many, if not most of the electronic records that were being appraised as permanent in the mid-1990s were databases from federal agencies, NARA's staff concentrated on preserving the logical and conceptual structure of databases.

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:01.881
NARA designed and implemented

01:13:01.979 --> 01:13:09.528
Archival Electronic Records Inspection and Control system, which was built on a relational database model.

01:13:10.509 --> 01:13:21.242
ERIC captured the basic structure of the database, storing all of the formats, codebooks, and other metadata that was entered into the system.

01:13:21.262 --> 01:13:29.792
Another outcome of the PROS litigation was NARA's more active involvement in the management of electronic records in the Clinton administration.

01:13:30.413 --> 01:13:46.753
which produced ample evidence of the need to address exponentially expanding quantities of electronic records and deal with more complex types of files, particularly in preserving the logical and conceptual structure of these electronic records.

01:13:47.534 --> 01:13:54.362
From this knowledge, Hayden the recognition that research would be required to find solutions to these issues.

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:10.366
For the third part of my presentation, I would like to focus on three current research projects that are attempting to address issues of interest to the audience.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:27.893
The first project is a major international research initiative in which archival scholars, computer engineering researchers, national archival institutions, and private industry representatives collaborate to develop theoretical and methodological knowledge

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.187
Required for the Permanent Preservation of Authentic Records in Electronic Systems.

01:14:34.207 --> 01:14:56.192
Interpari's International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems, and if you know that, among equals, who spent about three hours working on this name, is seeking to formulate model policies, strategies, and standards that will ensure the permanent preservation of records generated electronically.

01:14:57.151 --> 01:15:15.780
I am a member of the US team, which is funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, which is examining the issues relating to both the short and long-term durability, accessibility, and usability of electronic record systems, as well as the authentication of their content.

01:15:16.701 --> 01:15:24.593
The US team is also interdisciplinary, drawing remarkable triumphs, preservation management, library and information science,

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:27.082
computer science, and electrical engineering.

01:15:27.963 --> 01:15:36.476
And we are working together to identify and model the form, function, and structure of digital systems, their content, and their metadata.

01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:48.755
The broad goal of the Interpares project is to develop the theoretical and methodological knowledge essential for the permanent preservation of records created electronically.

01:15:49.756 --> 01:15:51.559
And on the basis of this knowledge,

01:15:51.860 --> 01:16:02.292
to formulate model policies, strategies, and standards capable of ensuring their preservation based on the requirements of various communities involved in this work.

01:16:03.333 --> 01:16:19.892
One focus of the American team is on systems design implications by translating the theoretical model, templates, and typologies into system design requirements and data and metadata models, and then implementing and evaluating those designs and models

01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:26.065
from different organizational, social, and national domains and across different types of digital records.

01:16:28.288 --> 01:16:37.980
The research plan for this international project has been divided into four interrelated domains of investigation, which are being conducted by passports.

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:47.652
The first domain focuses on the conceptual requirement for preserving authentic records by identifying the elements of electronic records

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:52.426
which are necessary to maintain the authenticity of records over time.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:17:08.489
The second domain addresses appraisal criteria, and its goal was determined whether the evaluation of electronic records for permanent preservation should be based on theoretical criteria different from those applied to traditional records.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:16.761
This task group will also investigate how digital technologies have affected the methodology of appraisal.

01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:32.569
The third domain, preservation, is attempting to identify and develop the procedures and resources required for the implementation of the conceptual requirements and criteria identified in the first two domains.

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:45.803
The fourth domain is targeting the formulation of principles that will guide the development of international, national, and organizational strategies, policy, and standards

01:17:46.205 --> 01:17:54.553
with a long-term preservation of electronic records based upon the environment in which each institution is located.

01:17:55.053 --> 01:17:56.695
Again, looking for best practices.

01:17:59.097 --> 01:18:04.222
One of the most important aspects of this research is the wide range of record types that are being tested.

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:14.592
Members of the American team are focusing on electronic record collections from government and universities, which will include student registration systems and collection information systems.

01:18:15.348 --> 01:18:20.677
Other countries are looking at automated patent systems, permit systems, and registers of wills.

01:18:21.638 --> 01:18:42.672
The work performed by the American team will provide approval concept rule for the enterprise, providing feedback which will then be used to reinforce or modify the theoretical model and generate and test systems analysis and design tools and strategies that can be factored in to future systems design

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.344
as well as policy and standard development in the areas of records.

01:18:47.865 --> 01:18:51.989
Can you hear me?

01:18:52.049 --> 01:18:54.291
I guess I'm not hearing these.

01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:55.312
I'm sorry.

01:18:55.332 --> 01:19:05.382
As well as the standards developed in the areas of digital records preservation, long-term access, and authentication for both active and legacy digital data.

01:19:07.484 --> 01:19:10.347
In your handout, there is the website

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:14.729
for more information of both the international team and the American team.

01:19:16.691 --> 01:19:27.763
The second research project, funded by the National Archives and Records Administration, in conjunction with the National Science Foundation, is being conducted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

01:19:27.943 --> 01:19:37.853
Entitled Collection-Based Persistent Digital Archives, the project seeks to bring together and integrate archival storage technology from supercomputer centers.

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:52.371
data grid technology from the computer science community, information models from the digital library community, and preservation models from the archival community to test the feasibility of preserving digital information for long periods of time.

01:19:53.273 --> 01:20:07.114
The supercomputer centers provide the technology required to store immense amounts of digital data currently being created, and the digital library community provides mechanisms to define the context needed to interpret the data.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:23.684
This project defines the challenge as maintaining the ability to discover, access, and display digital objects that are stored within an archive while the technology used to manage the archive evolves.

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:39.244
In this project, they attempt to store digital objects in collections and capture the metadata attributes needed to dynamically recreate the data collection, thus ensuring the migration of the context of these records.

01:20:40.321 --> 01:20:49.454
Thus far, they have produced a prototype using current technology, which they will continue to test and improve.

01:20:50.416 --> 01:21:04.296
This project is occurring now because the technology has evolved to a point where the goal of managing literally millions of email records and capturing the metadata about these records is now available.

01:21:05.297 --> 01:21:10.024
In a two-part article that appeared in ELAZ magazine in March and April 2000,

01:21:10.595 --> 01:21:19.022
the researchers discuss the project and provide a specific example of how to create a persistent collection of one million email messages.

01:21:21.124 --> 01:21:25.368
The persistent archive system has four major components.

01:21:25.488 --> 01:21:36.717
Support for ingestion, or what I believe most authors would probably call accessioning, archival storage, information discovery, and the presentation of the collection.

01:21:38.219 --> 01:21:39.640
In modeling the process,

01:21:40.075 --> 01:21:46.522
The authors describe the creation of a one million message persistent archive collection.

01:21:47.183 --> 01:21:51.507
They characterize this persistent archive as two phases.

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:56.713
Remember, these are technologists when I use the next term.

01:21:56.873 --> 01:22:03.741
The archiving of the collection and the retrieval or instantiation of the collection onto new technology.

01:22:04.842 --> 01:22:07.585
The processes used to adjust the collection

01:22:08.071 --> 01:22:20.968
transform it into an infrastructure-independent form using XML and store the information in an archive are the persistent storage steps of this persistent archive.

01:22:20.988 --> 01:22:33.924
Processes used to recreate the collection on new technology, optimize the database, and recreate the user interface are the retrieval or migration steps of this persistent archive.

01:22:33.944 --> 01:22:35.226
As the authors point out,

01:22:35.645 --> 01:22:42.635
The technology to support each of these processes is still rapidly evolving, and further research is required.

01:22:43.937 --> 01:22:55.994
NHPRC has awarded a grant to San Diego Supercomputer Center to develop a toolkit that will enable smaller repositories to accomplish the goals regarding digital data.

01:22:56.835 --> 01:23:02.563
And again, I have their website and the citation for the article on your handout.

01:23:05.024 --> 01:23:24.251
A third initiative, which informs the two projects I just discussed and which I think a lot of you are probably familiar with, is the open archival information system, OASIS, which is an initiative by the National Aeronautics Space Agency's consultative committee for space data systems.

01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:32.162
OASIS serves as a conceptual framework for an archival system dedicated to preserving and maintaining access over time.

01:23:32.986 --> 01:23:59.567
committee developed this model to increase awareness and understanding of the concepts required preserving digital objects particularly with non-archival institutions elucidate terminology and concepts for describing and comparing data models and archival architectures expand consensus on the elements and processes necessary for digital information preservation and divide a framework

01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:03.135
guiding the identification and development of standards.

01:24:05.058 --> 01:24:11.148
The reference model, because of its emphasis on digital objects, has been well received by a diverse community.

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:25.791
A number of digital initiatives in the library community, including Cedars, Pandora, and Medlib projects that either adopted the OASIS model as a conceptual framework for their digital preservation efforts or have been influenced by it.

01:24:27.205 --> 01:24:32.753
Currently, the OASIS reference model is a draft international standards organization, ISO standard.

01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:51.481
An open archival information system is understood to me, any organization or system that has the task of preserving information over time and making it accessible to a specified class of users, known as the designated community.

01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:56.588
The term open refers to the fact the model and future recommendations

01:24:56.855 --> 01:24:58.276
are developed in open form.

01:24:59.057 --> 01:25:06.604
It does not make the increase of positions concerning the level of accessibility in the archive.

01:25:06.624 --> 01:25:10.227
There are minimum requirements for an OASIS-type archive.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:14.772
Negotiate and accept appropriate information from information producers.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:20.497
Obtain sufficient control of the information to ensure long-term preservation.

01:25:21.618 --> 01:25:24.921
Determine the scope of the designated community, your user group.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:55.920
ensure that the information is understood by the designated community without the assistance of the information producers, follow documented policies and procedures to ensure that the information is preserved against reasonable contingency, and in addition, to enable the information to be disseminated as authenticated copies of the original or as traceable to the original, and make the information available to the designated community.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:04.292
I apologize.

01:26:04.432 --> 01:26:05.813
My hand got too heavy too fast.

01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:15.624
The OASIS initiative is moving forward with efforts to explore possible areas for standardization within the framework of the reference model.

01:26:16.265 --> 01:26:32.303
A workshop in College Park, Maryland in October 1999, Archival Workshop on Ingest, Identification, and Certification Standards, established an initial agenda for pursuing standardization in the areas of ingest, interaction between the archive and the data producer,

01:26:32.789 --> 01:26:50.914
Identification, establishing a system of permanent, unique identifiers for archival digital objects, and certification, development of accreditation policies protocols to establish the authenticity, quality, and usefulness of an archive holding.

01:26:50.934 --> 01:27:01.328
The workshop also sought to determine who would be interested in participating in working groups dedicated to pursuing standardization in the areas discussed in the workshop.

01:27:01.932 --> 01:27:06.677
Response was positive and the groups are expected to form and begin meeting in the near future.

01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:23.513
For additional information about this initiative, including the OACIS reference model, proceedings from the workshop, and other material related to the preservation of digital materials, you should visit the site that's on the frame that you have in front of you.

01:27:25.035 --> 01:27:30.640
I have spent the last 40 odd minutes talking about the experiences of the National Archives.

01:27:31.075 --> 01:27:33.198
preserving electronic records over time.

01:27:33.979 --> 01:27:53.504
From recopying flat files that were the required type of record transferred in the 1970s up through the 1990s, to the development of both APS and ERIC, to begin to address the issues of migration across platforms of the complex files that were beginning to be accessed by the Center for Electronic Records.

01:27:54.606 --> 01:27:55.767
When I was at the Center,

01:27:56.219 --> 01:28:02.825
and forced to confront the seemingly impossible task of copying backup tapes from the Reagan and Bush White House computer systems.

01:28:03.726 --> 01:28:08.751
I was often reminded by my colleagues that I was living in an interesting time.

01:28:09.872 --> 01:28:13.696
I would use the same expression to you, we're living in an interesting time.

01:28:15.918 --> 01:28:24.707
But perhaps my experience of finding methods to approach the problem will give you the confidence to participate

01:28:24.991 --> 01:28:35.288
and the exciting research that is taking place today as these various research initiatives seek to find ways to ensure the preservation of authentic records over time.

01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:40.196
I do not believe that there is one answer to fit all situations.

01:28:41.198 --> 01:28:51.555
But I do believe that we are beginning to ask the right questions and the research tools are being provided to give us possible methods for accomplishing our goal.

01:28:52.278 --> 01:28:57.430
I encourage you to actively monitor, and when possible, join in these efforts.

01:28:58.572 --> 01:28:59.234
We do not.

01:28:59.815 --> 01:29:02.681
You will lose our electronically created records.

01:29:03.583 --> 01:29:05.668
And I will echo the call.

01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:08.514
Just say yes.

01:29:08.534 --> 01:29:08.835
Thank you.
