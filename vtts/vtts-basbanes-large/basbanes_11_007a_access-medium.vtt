WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:10.031
You know, he thinks that you're doing this.

00:10.151 --> 00:11.273
You're talking to James Chay.

00:11.293 --> 00:13.998
He'll focus exactly if you have it in for the city.

00:14.018 --> 00:16.403
It's something that has nothing to do with life.

00:17.865 --> 00:19.248
And he doesn't know what that is.

00:19.268 --> 00:24.498
Have you ever made a statement that you're going to make life miserable for the city?

00:24.518 --> 00:24.598
No.

00:24.618 --> 00:25.279
All I'm doing is this.

00:25.613 --> 00:31.944
I would say, according to what the man said, I thought I'd give you an opportunity to respond to it.

00:31.964 --> 00:33.005
That's ridiculous, is that right?

00:34.588 --> 00:37.853
Yeah, I would say that's ridiculous.

00:38.094 --> 00:42.721
I'm interested in libraries, I'm interested in books, as I told you on the phone.

00:42.741 --> 00:50.895
I'm more interested in it as a case study for a political, social, linguistic life.

00:51.365 --> 00:59.594
Actually, in a sense, I stumbled onto the library more than, you know, sitting out at home.

00:59.614 --> 01:02.404
You know, I just kind of stumbled into it.

01:03.059 --> 01:10.549
So I kind of stumbled into the library.

01:13.393 --> 01:27.733
Well, I'm kind of a computer consultant, but I'm not economically motivated.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.876
You know, I usually take the fifth on that.

01:29.996 --> 01:31.779
I mean, I'm a citizen.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.805
You know, the French Revolution's passed.

01:35.885 --> 01:40.052
We don't categorize people by their class yet.

01:40.072 --> 01:48.705
But, you know, I mean... Yes.

01:48.865 --> 01:48.945
Yes.

01:48.925 --> 01:54.631
Actually, I kind of view myself as every man, in a sense.

01:54.651 --> 02:07.325
You know, I'm just a savage guy who stumbled into what I saw as things wrong in the library.

02:07.345 --> 02:11.089
You mentioned some of the papers you brought me.

02:11.109 --> 02:13.752
What is David Batsy's R2?

02:14.255 --> 02:15.036
Yes, long before.

02:15.176 --> 02:25.030
I'd be interested in finding out what you're really interested in.

02:25.050 --> 02:27.694
There's so many facets of the story.

02:28.395 --> 02:34.103
There's the foundation, which is a huge facet.

02:34.842 --> 02:36.784
kind of Oedipus contracts.

02:36.804 --> 02:40.368
I mean, this was envisioned.

02:40.388 --> 02:42.851
We're talking about the New England Irish.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.553
Did you say Oedipus or Oedipus?

02:44.573 --> 02:44.733
Oedipus.

02:44.753 --> 02:44.994
E-D-I-F-I-C.

02:45.014 --> 02:45.995
It is, yes.

02:46.255 --> 02:48.518
It's a pun, obviously.

02:48.538 --> 02:51.060
For the sake of my state, so I don't screw it up when I can.

02:51.181 --> 02:51.561
Yes.

02:52.542 --> 02:52.903
Oedipus.

02:53.283 --> 02:55.606
And actually, Kevin Starr.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.929
Who I plan to talk to you about.

02:58.989 --> 02:59.470
Wonderful.

03:00.131 --> 03:01.272
I don't know how...

03:01.825 --> 03:05.911
forthcoming he will be with you because he opposed the library.

03:06.471 --> 03:08.354
Back in those days he certainly did.

03:09.035 --> 03:14.503
As a matter of fact, he considered it a very, he wrote a column for a newspaper.

03:14.543 --> 03:19.409
He was actually a newspaper columnist after he left his term as city librarian.

03:20.891 --> 03:28.542
And he wrote a column in which he said the drive to create a new main library was a very harmful fantasy.

03:29.737 --> 03:34.983
And he, the title of that column was The Oedipus Complex.

03:36.085 --> 03:39.689
So you should ask him about the Oedipus Complex and that.

03:39.709 --> 03:42.513
Do you have a copy of that?

03:42.533 --> 03:43.994
Oh, sure.

03:44.435 --> 03:44.595
Sure.

03:44.735 --> 03:48.520
I didn't think of it, but I'd go ahead and send it to you.

03:48.540 --> 03:59.153
And he's actually come on record since it was built, saying that this was, in a sense, turning the library around.

04:00.247 --> 04:07.699
I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he's got a very sensitive position.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.344
Because he's a state librarian.

04:10.364 --> 04:13.008
He's a state librarian, and it's a political job.

04:13.028 --> 04:15.572
And it probably plays very well.

04:15.853 --> 04:17.255
He plays very well, yes.

04:19.158 --> 04:23.706
And not only that, but...

04:25.255 --> 04:41.812
There's a certain amount of prestige that goes with it, and he's, you know, he's a historian, very well public.

04:42.232 --> 04:55.245
So, that being so, he's probably going to soften his previous position, but he was, yes, he was against it in the formative stages, because he felt it was an eticus complex.

04:55.816 --> 05:11.118
And actually, as bad as the new main library is, the desperate insistence to create it is almost more harmful than the building itself.

05:12.219 --> 05:17.807
Because it's really been almost a hostage situation.

05:18.631 --> 05:22.775
They basically said, you know, we want a new main library.

05:23.756 --> 05:27.299
We don't care about the function, we don't care about the books, we don't care about anything.

05:27.319 --> 05:29.481
We want a new building.

05:29.641 --> 05:33.004
Without perhaps even any concept of what a library is.

05:33.104 --> 05:34.926
Without even a concept of what a library is.

05:35.506 --> 05:39.550
And complete negligence, in my opinion, of what a library is.

05:40.451 --> 05:48.638
I mean, they were willing to subsume the function to the drive to create a new building.

05:49.073 --> 05:53.662
So what did you stumble on?

05:53.682 --> 05:56.528
And give me a sense of the time.

05:56.548 --> 05:56.929
1975.

05:56.949 --> 06:00.436
This goes back 23 years.

06:00.456 --> 06:04.283
This goes back 23 years, yeah.

06:04.303 --> 06:08.372
What happened?

06:08.392 --> 06:09.073
Well, I mean, I just...

06:12.732 --> 06:20.925
kind of walked innocently into the library and saw some things that I thought a person would complain about.

06:22.668 --> 06:32.243
Well, actually, I don't like to get into that whole story because it feeds into the whole panel's crowd.

06:32.628 --> 06:49.270
there's something there that I'm refusing to let go that there's some kind of excessive thing and actually it's not that I mean it's now become a project having to do with curiosity and a sense of

06:50.397 --> 06:54.504
personal duty and kind of an investigation into our critical life.

06:55.165 --> 06:59.372
You know, I'm not trying to get revenge for what happened then.

06:59.793 --> 07:02.658
And if I tell the stories, it'll probably sound like that.

07:02.678 --> 07:06.364
But it was a situation that was kind of a blast, classic.

07:06.766 --> 07:29.753
bureaucratic situation where people were just uh denying what had happened and were very hostile to outsiders and it was very much a uh a bunker mentality you know anybody who's an outsider is the enemy and they saw me as an outsider in their foreign enemy see i don't understand i'm not following the word i'm still i still don't have enough

07:30.391 --> 07:38.725
I still don't understand what motivated you to launch a 23-year project.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.610
Well, I mean, I didn't sit out.

07:41.670 --> 07:47.079
Something must have happened.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.541
No, that's not true.

07:48.561 --> 07:52.408
But that's the sense that I have, correct me.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.673
Why would you be... I mean, I'm from Massachusetts, I'm here.

07:56.058 --> 08:18.826
I've got a totally open heart.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.028
When I've read, I've seen some of these things fire coming.

08:20.048 --> 08:20.428
It all makes sense.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.289
I would like to have a sense of admission.

08:21.309 --> 08:22.130
It makes you feel comfortable telling me.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.432
If I'm going to write it, I have to know what I'm talking about.

08:23.412 --> 08:46.618
I'm not involved in the library because I'm interested in myself.

08:47.088 --> 08:56.340
I mean, I can go out and sell widgets and be consumed with myself.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.161
It's not about me.

08:57.882 --> 09:02.047
It's about, well, first of all, it's about my politics.

09:03.229 --> 09:06.733
I'm very much what you'd call a classic liberal.

09:07.405 --> 09:11.295
I believe in social equality.

09:11.896 --> 09:13.540
I believe in a sense of justice.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.184
I believe in the rule of law.

09:15.846 --> 09:20.217
And all of those things

09:21.327 --> 09:24.931
kind of come into play here.

09:24.951 --> 09:30.677
We have what we euphemistically refer to as a democratic society.

09:31.418 --> 09:40.007
But in fact, there's been a tremendous backlash against universal education.

09:40.027 --> 09:45.293
I mean, the society is so geared towards

09:46.640 --> 10:13.947
entrepreneurialism and commercialism and the sense of making money and the status associated with making money that we've lost all of those egalitarian values and so it has a lot to do with my politics and my perception that the public library as the people's university

10:14.737 --> 10:18.783
was supposed to be open to everyone.

10:18.803 --> 10:24.011
And not only when I showed up in the library was it hostile to me as an outside member of the public.

10:25.513 --> 10:32.664
It's hostile to everybody who's not in the corporate mode.

10:32.684 --> 10:34.627
You perceived this back in 1975?

10:34.727 --> 10:35.848
Oh yes.

10:36.269 --> 10:36.930
Yes.

10:37.282 --> 10:47.857
I mean, and actually, you're probably coming across people like Andre Grimes and others who are saying the same things.

10:47.877 --> 10:55.948
You know, but back then, I was kind of the only one saying, you know, we've taken something that was supposed to be published.

10:56.148 --> 11:23.033
and turned it into a, a very much a, an upper class, a reflection of, um,

11:24.582 --> 11:39.867
There's a certain kind of society that goes to the opera and is very proud of the fact that they go to the opera and they consider themselves more cultured, more civilized.

11:41.049 --> 11:49.763
And of course going to the opera for them turns out to be more about spending about $10,000 on a dress than it does about the music.

11:51.413 --> 11:59.368
Well, to a very substantial extent, the public library has been captured by that mentality.

11:59.388 --> 12:04.879
You know, Mr. Coulter will tell you, oh yeah, we raised such and such, and people gave money.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.005
Well, people gave money to get their names.

12:09.183 --> 12:11.528
on all of their bookcases.

12:12.510 --> 12:18.201
But if they gave a half million dollars to help the library, is that bad?

12:18.982 --> 12:19.223
No.

12:19.724 --> 12:24.794
If they gave a half million dollars to help the library, it's not bad.

12:26.497 --> 12:27.399
But that is the crucial thing.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.427
Because in fact, you know, Joe and Gus Fields,

12:31.795 --> 12:33.818
He says, oh, I love libraries.

12:33.878 --> 12:41.149
When I was a kid, you know, I went to the library and went after him.

12:41.169 --> 12:52.946
So now he's Joe Industrialist, and he's got half a million dollars, and so he gives half a million dollars.

12:52.966 --> 13:00.857
But what happens is he gives that half million dollars to a private foundation

13:01.512 --> 13:05.718
called the Library Foundation.

13:05.738 --> 13:13.229
And that Library Foundation has its own agenda.

13:13.249 --> 13:23.483
When the Library Foundation first started soliciting funds, they had this very nice brochure that said, we're raising money for the house of the book.

13:23.703 --> 13:29.832
And what happened, and what really happened

13:30.233 --> 13:32.575
What really destroyed that building?

13:32.595 --> 13:34.417
What really created Brooks Hall?

13:34.437 --> 13:36.619
What really created this whole mess?

13:38.540 --> 13:46.368
Is that they wanted to create the foundation in the space rental business.

13:46.988 --> 13:47.489
In the what?

13:47.509 --> 13:51.112
Space rental business.

13:51.312 --> 13:53.274
And that's really the story.

13:53.414 --> 13:58.358
Is they wanted to get a franchise with a foundation for space rental.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.240
So what's the purpose, sir?

14:01.553 --> 14:08.121
just to continue them as an entity, primarily.

14:08.181 --> 14:15.309
But then you see how, you know, the nice industrialist with the half million dollars suddenly creates an entity.

14:16.270 --> 14:19.934
The entity has got to propagate itself.

14:21.236 --> 14:30.767
It propagates itself by entrepreneurial values, commercial values, and then, in order to keep the thing going,

14:31.540 --> 14:37.933
it has to destroy its host, kind of like a classical parasite.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.157
Really, like a classical parasite.

14:40.177 --> 14:44.285
It destroys its host.

14:45.287 --> 14:47.351
So anyway, that's a fascinating story.

14:47.932 --> 14:52.401
I saw this in kind of embryo form back in 75.

14:52.803 --> 14:55.286
and got entranced.

14:55.306 --> 14:56.588
What specifically did you see?

14:56.909 --> 15:05.901
Because, I mean, in 75, it was even 12 years before, or six years before COVID, it was up in San Francisco, it became an 81 and told me.

15:06.241 --> 15:07.383
Oh, that's not good.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.727
That's why I asked him on the table.

15:10.747 --> 15:13.030
He's a former state left out of Nevada.

15:13.130 --> 15:13.511
That's right.

15:14.272 --> 15:18.317
So when did that happen if he's been here since 81?

15:18.658 --> 15:20.380
I don't think he's that old.

15:20.697 --> 15:23.284
Yeah, I don't know.

15:24.908 --> 15:26.954
Yeah, I don't know.

15:27.014 --> 15:31.125
I thought he was younger than that.

15:31.546 --> 15:32.188
I don't know.

15:32.248 --> 15:36.580
Yeah, I haven't really investigated him on that story.

15:36.560 --> 15:51.970
I wonder what is his background?

15:51.950 --> 16:03.874
argues for him to have this extremely powerful position of determining the future and function of our political life.

16:03.894 --> 16:07.461
I am a book person.

16:07.441 --> 16:20.700
I'm the immediate past president of the Friends of the Library at Clarkson University in Washington, Massachusetts.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.162
I'm the perfect choice for that job.

16:22.182 --> 16:30.493
I'm a 20 year book editor, I'm a bibliophile, I've written a book about books, I write about books, I write about... I'm a good choice.

16:30.513 --> 16:30.974
Why is anyone a choice?

16:30.994 --> 16:32.436
Anyway, I don't need to digress anything.

16:32.416 --> 16:34.120
I don't know.

16:34.300 --> 16:50.779
Have you heard anybody mention Marjorie Stone?

16:51.518 --> 17:10.896
Isn't she the one who has a roommate for her?

17:10.916 --> 17:10.996
Yes.

17:11.016 --> 17:11.877
She's the one who, she's the driving force.

17:11.897 --> 17:17.722
She's the one who created the foundation.

17:17.742 --> 17:18.043
That's correct.

17:18.063 --> 17:18.363
What about her?

17:18.383 --> 17:19.344
Well... Maybe I should talk to her or something.

17:19.364 --> 17:19.704
Maybe you should.

17:19.724 --> 17:20.084
She's, uh... Okay.

17:20.104 --> 17:20.665
Why do you mention her name?

17:22.990 --> 17:25.373
Because she was the driving force.

17:25.613 --> 17:26.374
Right.

17:27.055 --> 17:32.521
And in a sense, she was very Coulter-esque.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.102
Right.

17:34.223 --> 17:43.193
Actually, you know, I mean, these friends fall into a certain paradigm.

17:43.213 --> 17:45.615
I mean, before the Foundation, we complained about the friends.

17:46.697 --> 17:49.740
Before there was Coulter, we complained about a guy named Inlander.

17:50.598 --> 18:00.488
As a matter of fact, one of the first things we said about England, about Culver, was that he out-Englanded Englanders.

18:01.189 --> 18:12.281
This kind of move towards empire building, at the expense of the function of the library, and contempt for outsiders and the whole thing, has been around for a long time.

18:12.381 --> 18:13.642
Yes.

18:13.722 --> 18:19.508
Margaret Stern studied the friends too.

18:20.433 --> 18:32.752
Well, the reason I bring this up is Kevin Starr was a city librarian for a little under three years, about three and a half years.

18:32.952 --> 18:39.803
And he wrote a column in which he admitted that Marjory Stern fired him.

18:40.243 --> 18:46.693
And he said to me personally on that subject that Marjory Stern was literally crazy.

18:47.264 --> 18:51.349
Do you want to call him this as the screening panel?

18:51.669 --> 18:51.909
Yes.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.632
How did she have that power?

18:56.394 --> 18:57.976
She was a library commissioner at that time.

18:59.398 --> 19:07.747
And she, not only did she start the foundation, but she started the plant.

19:07.947 --> 19:14.655
And she had been, by the time she lost her position,

19:15.462 --> 19:16.543
on the library commission.

19:16.563 --> 19:24.171
She had been a library commissioner for 25 years.

19:24.251 --> 19:31.119
And I'm not sure why.

19:31.779 --> 19:36.364
I suspect that Carlson and Colt had complained about it.

19:36.464 --> 19:43.832
By that time, Carlson and Colt had had enough power and had our diagnosis either.

19:44.420 --> 19:48.745
that they probably complained to Art Agnes about her, but I don't know.

19:49.506 --> 19:52.669
I mean, that's something to find out from somebody else.

19:52.749 --> 19:55.833
I don't know why, but Art Agnes let her go.

19:58.556 --> 20:00.858
Probably only Art Agnes knows.

20:00.878 --> 20:06.985
But she had been a library commissioner for 25 years at that point, so she was a long-term poet.

20:07.589 --> 20:27.873
on the Library Commission.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.815
This is the first time one of them, because I don't know if you've got a library in the library.

20:29.835 --> 20:30.316
Oh, yes.

20:30.336 --> 20:31.537
So she's the driving force, apparently, for the new library.

20:31.557 --> 20:31.637
Yes.

20:31.657 --> 20:32.638
I think she had a sense of what she wanted to do.

20:32.658 --> 20:33.599
The library, I mean, is Ken Dowling, I believe.

20:33.619 --> 20:34.120
Ken Dowling?

20:36.057 --> 20:41.844
became a librarian, kind of at a time when they couldn't get anybody else to do it.

20:41.864 --> 20:58.545
A guy who just died, and actually a guy you should really have been able to talk to, because he knew a lot of crucial elements of the story, was the guy between Kevin Starr and Kim Dowling.

20:58.565 --> 21:01.769
There was only one librarian between Kevin Starr and Kim Dowling.

21:01.789 --> 21:02.109
Holman?

21:02.930 --> 21:05.794
No, Holman was before Starr.

21:06.044 --> 21:10.909
That would be interesting to talk to.

21:10.989 --> 21:13.772
I've never talked to him myself.

21:13.992 --> 21:17.575
He predates thought.

21:17.595 --> 21:21.319
In fact, he wanted me to come to Austin to talk to him.

21:21.339 --> 21:24.582
He's very eager to get his take.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.426
That's fascinating.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.389
I hope Kevin Starr will be forthcoming.

21:31.930 --> 21:33.311
It would be fascinating if he is.

21:34.132 --> 21:35.393
I'll certainly find him.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.079
All I can do is ask the questions.

21:39.099 --> 21:39.941
He's in Sacramento.

21:40.121 --> 21:41.382
You don't have to ask him.

21:41.402 --> 21:43.265
I can find anybody.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.288
Trust me.

21:45.388 --> 21:51.676
So, Marjorie Stein fired Kevin Starr.

21:52.938 --> 21:53.178
Why?

21:53.899 --> 21:55.541
Because he opposed the edifice?

21:55.561 --> 21:55.802
Yes.

21:57.684 --> 22:03.211
And Kevin Starr makes it clear in one of these columns.

22:03.231 --> 22:05.194
And actually, not only that,

22:05.647 --> 22:17.601
But one of his novels, Land's End, is really kind of a Romare play of his experience at the San Francisco Public Library.

22:17.621 --> 22:18.462
What's the name of the book?

22:18.482 --> 22:19.223
Land's End.

22:19.243 --> 22:20.124
It's a novel?

22:20.304 --> 22:21.546
Yes.

22:21.566 --> 22:23.468
I didn't realize he wrote fiction.

22:23.488 --> 22:23.909
He did.

22:24.489 --> 22:25.050
He wrote this.

22:26.211 --> 22:32.679
It's a published book?

22:32.739 --> 22:33.260
Oh, yeah.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.182
Is the character a librarian in the book?

22:35.202 --> 22:35.282
Yes.

22:36.967 --> 22:40.291
Well, that's very interesting.

22:40.311 --> 22:40.992
Yes.

22:41.012 --> 22:43.815
When was that published?

22:44.536 --> 22:46.518
79, 80, something like that.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.501
It might be hard to think.

22:48.521 --> 22:50.183
Was the publisher a major publisher?

22:50.203 --> 22:50.523
Oh, yeah.

22:50.983 --> 22:57.411
Yeah, I think it was... I've forgotten now, but it was like a... It was a major publisher.

22:57.471 --> 22:58.813
It was a major deal.

22:59.333 --> 22:59.614
Kind of.

22:59.634 --> 23:00.354
Was it reviewed there?

23:00.374 --> 23:00.655
Oh, yeah.

23:00.955 --> 23:02.797
And what was the most nice?

23:03.298 --> 23:05.100
It was fairly good.

23:06.042 --> 23:14.713
Did they recognize that it was probably a take of his experiences here?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.237
Oh, well, the insiders are here.

23:18.098 --> 23:22.484
Matter of fact, there's a key going around somewhere.

23:22.504 --> 23:25.307
I don't know if I've got it.

23:25.327 --> 23:30.514
Because all of the people, he gave them

23:30.865 --> 23:32.007
like substitute names.

23:32.387 --> 23:34.771
When I say it's a Roma or Clea, I really mean that.

23:34.971 --> 23:40.780
You know, I mean all of these people recognize themselves as characters.

23:40.800 --> 23:46.509
Is it good nature, or is it kind of subtle experience?

23:47.571 --> 23:49.975
It's relatively sarcastic.

23:49.995 --> 23:52.679
It's relatively sarcastic.

23:52.699 --> 23:57.987
And he describes in that how the Marjorie Stern in the novel, Firesman,

23:59.333 --> 24:02.942
You have to talk to her, don't I?

24:04.004 --> 24:04.967
Yes, probably you do.

24:05.307 --> 24:07.332
She's relatively elderly now.

24:07.352 --> 24:09.578
She's late 70s or early 80s herself.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.968
I'll talk to Kelly Olsen last night.

24:13.988 --> 24:15.351
She's 85.

24:15.552 --> 24:17.697
I hesitate to tell you to talk to her.

24:18.098 --> 24:20.180
because she can be quite seductive.

24:20.280 --> 24:26.508
She's one of these people that's, but yeah, I mean, if I were you, I'd talk to you, it's true.

24:26.528 --> 24:42.085
You know, truth is the best, the only way to get a real... So, so anyway, Marjorie Stern fires Kevin Starr, hires John Frans.

24:42.506 --> 24:45.329
He was city librarian for exactly 10 years.

24:46.490 --> 24:47.131
John Frans.

24:47.151 --> 24:47.852
John Frans.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.641
F-R-A-N-T-Z.

24:51.183 --> 24:53.925
And it's a shame he knew so much.

24:53.945 --> 24:58.569
He died in January of this year.

24:58.589 --> 25:04.435
His widow is still around.

25:04.535 --> 25:09.320
I don't know how much she knows.

25:09.340 --> 25:16.466
But anyway, he was... Oh, you know who you should really talk to?

25:16.486 --> 25:17.367
Is the lady who...

25:17.735 --> 25:20.118
Gladys Hansen.

25:20.138 --> 25:26.486
Gladys Hansen was city archivist for 20-some years or so.

25:28.689 --> 25:32.374
And she was an old hand in the library.

25:32.514 --> 25:36.840
Detective and your woman who's got the city archivist, Susan Taylor.

25:37.107 --> 25:41.133
Susan, what's the name?

25:41.694 --> 25:43.116
Taylor?

25:43.937 --> 25:48.003
Isn't it Susan Taylor?

25:48.844 --> 25:51.067
Oh, good.

25:51.348 --> 25:51.568
Nice, nice.

25:51.588 --> 25:57.777
She's going to do the good show today.

25:57.797 --> 25:59.019
We have 50 photographs of the place.

25:59.039 --> 26:01.542
Yeah, I don't know her very well.

26:01.663 --> 26:03.425
So, John Franz was there for 10 years.

26:03.986 --> 26:06.169
And Marguerite Stone basically fired him.

26:07.550 --> 26:09.493
because we didn't support the new name I did.

26:11.516 --> 26:23.473
And he actually wrote some very bitter things about how the library was a bad idea during the campaign.

26:23.493 --> 26:30.523
And Gladys Hansen gave an interview to a newspaper reporter and she said it was a bad idea.

26:30.543 --> 26:32.766
And it came down on her pretty hard.

26:32.806 --> 26:35.650
Why did they always feel that it was a bad idea?

26:38.600 --> 26:51.153
I mean, had it been a really wonderful design that had been built to accommodate books, would you be opposed to it, or were you just opposed to any building in principle?

26:51.914 --> 26:52.254
No.

26:53.235 --> 26:59.201
Actually, I think, speaking for myself, I wasn't against the Newman Library so much.

26:59.281 --> 27:03.105
I was against all of the lies that they had to tell to build it.

27:03.676 --> 27:15.718
Well, I mean, they said they would never move the Pioneer Monument.

27:16.660 --> 27:25.857
The new Main Library was going to be able to go into that meeting.

27:25.877 --> 27:26.258
Right.

27:27.588 --> 27:29.731
Well, I mean, they said all kinds of things.

27:29.791 --> 27:33.355
They said that remote storage was a bad idea.

27:33.535 --> 27:37.420
They said you could never accept remote storage.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.843
They said all of the books have to be on open shelves.

27:40.724 --> 27:48.274
And there was a whole bunch of things about what the real capacity of the old building was that was alive.

27:48.534 --> 27:55.603
It was impossible to remodel it.

27:56.073 --> 28:01.582
You know, all this stuff, it was just pure malargy.

28:01.602 --> 28:11.318
At what point did you become an activist in publishing these things, writing things, finding suits?

28:11.338 --> 28:16.045
My very first suit was August 10, 1977.

28:16.065 --> 28:21.574
Twenty years ago.

28:21.841 --> 28:30.814
Well, it alleged that they were going to hold a secret meeting.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.238
How did you know that?

28:33.258 --> 28:38.045
Because they announced it at the previous meeting.

28:38.065 --> 28:39.287
A secret meeting could do what?

28:39.728 --> 28:47.379
Well, actually what they did was that they said they were going to hold a meeting at a branch.

28:47.399 --> 28:51.325
And they said that they were going to have a tour of the branch

28:51.693 --> 28:54.958
just for themselves that would not include the public.

28:58.143 --> 29:01.388
And of course you can't do that.

29:01.408 --> 29:09.359
If you have a meeting that includes a tour, you have to let the public come on the tour.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.464
They said the law didn't say that, so I sued.

29:12.865 --> 29:15.068
And of course they backed down

29:16.718 --> 29:19.703
and allowed people to come on the tour.

29:20.163 --> 29:21.325
Did you vote yourself?

29:21.345 --> 29:21.746
Of course.

29:23.629 --> 29:27.736
But of course it was dismissed because they admitted that I was right.

29:28.437 --> 29:32.523
And then they'd turn around and say, oh well you lost because it was dismissed.

29:32.543 --> 29:35.107
No, I didn't lose because it was dismissed.

29:36.790 --> 29:41.798
It was dismissed because you backed down, which means that I won.

29:42.993 --> 29:46.998
You know, I was dismissed because I won.

29:47.018 --> 29:50.081
But that was, as you said, that was 20 years ago.

29:50.181 --> 29:52.584
So how many suits have been filed off the air over the years?

29:53.285 --> 29:53.485
Hey.

29:55.547 --> 29:57.269
Seats keeping in two categories?

29:57.950 --> 29:58.190
No.

29:58.591 --> 30:02.475
Actually, there have only been suits in two categories.

30:02.495 --> 30:07.000
One, duplicate net, open meeting suits.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.242
And the Furman suits.

30:09.283 --> 30:10.384
What are the Furman suits?

30:10.583 --> 30:17.331
The Furman suits are the famous trust that he's probably talking to Nick Baker about.

30:17.351 --> 30:19.714
Apparently he's talking to Nick Baker about it.

30:19.734 --> 30:19.914
Yeah.

30:19.974 --> 30:21.416
He really urged me to see you.

30:21.876 --> 30:23.138
Uh-huh.

30:23.218 --> 30:25.781
He said, ask you to tell me about the Furman suit.

30:25.801 --> 30:26.602
So he didn't tell me.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.183
Right.

30:27.203 --> 30:32.589
Well, this was a situation where... Give me the full name of Furman, because this is my name.

30:32.729 --> 30:33.810
Alfred Furman.

30:33.870 --> 30:36.474
F-U-R-M-A-N?

30:36.534 --> 30:37.755
No, F-U-H-R.

30:39.558 --> 30:41.460
F-U-H-R.

30:42.181 --> 30:50.591
Actually, not only did he leave some money, he left land.

30:50.952 --> 31:02.646
Well, the crucial story is that he left four city plots in San Francisco.

31:03.318 --> 31:08.545
Yeah, no, I mean they were housing locks.

31:08.805 --> 31:16.435
Three of them were right over here on Ellis Street, and one of them was in Excelsior.

31:20.640 --> 31:27.229
And so there was a plot in Monterey County, and there was a plot in Crane County.

31:28.891 --> 31:31.975
And they discovered oil.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.721
on the land in Kern County.

31:34.062 --> 31:36.368
How do you spell Kern?

31:36.889 --> 31:37.872
K-E-R-N.

31:39.756 --> 31:41.000
Where is that?

31:41.020 --> 31:42.724
That's like Bakersfield.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.684
down and east.

31:45.984 --> 31:47.446
It's like, it's desert.

31:47.466 --> 31:50.128
You know, it's the great city.

31:52.070 --> 31:56.235
German started out as a union activist.

31:56.255 --> 31:58.016
He was a very strong union man.

31:58.037 --> 32:01.480
He was in the Brewer's Union and the Siemens Union.

32:01.560 --> 32:06.005
They ran him out of the union movement and he became a lawyer.

32:06.245 --> 32:12.171
And he made most of his money doing probate work for the German community.

32:12.573 --> 32:13.254
He spoke German.

32:13.274 --> 32:14.275
He came here from Germany.

32:15.337 --> 32:20.343
So what moved him to be such a German?

32:21.485 --> 32:23.127
He was very specific about that.

32:23.748 --> 32:33.000
He still believed in the working man, and he wanted to help the working man understand the system that they were living under.

32:33.140 --> 32:35.323
Oh yeah.

32:35.658 --> 32:37.741
Would you be able to send me copies?

32:37.901 --> 32:40.144
Sure, I'll send you whatever you want.

32:40.644 --> 32:42.506
I need to see the stuff.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.609
Right, sure.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.732
When did he die, do you remember up there?

32:46.812 --> 32:47.593
Yeah, 39.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.997
So this is now almost 16 years old in particular.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.098
Yes.

32:52.118 --> 32:57.185
And he specifically provided what?

32:57.205 --> 33:02.631
He provided, well actually he gave his money to the city for two purposes.

33:02.651 --> 33:03.252
Money and property.

33:04.109 --> 33:12.076
Yes, money, cash, stocks and bonds, and land.

33:12.096 --> 33:18.101
And actually at that time, you know, the cash was like $100,000.

33:18.121 --> 33:18.742
Not bad.

33:19.142 --> 33:21.064
That's a lot of money since then.

33:21.084 --> 33:23.826
The stocks and bonds were about $240,000.

33:24.106 --> 33:27.369
That's a considerable amount of money.

33:27.409 --> 33:28.650
Yes, in those days.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.932
We're talking about before the First World War.

33:30.972 --> 33:32.374
That was a chunk of change.

33:33.154 --> 33:34.015
It went second.

33:34.484 --> 33:36.987
Didn't you know what I said?

33:37.007 --> 33:38.449
No, before the Second World War.

33:38.469 --> 33:42.154
Yeah, just as the Second World War was breaking out, you guys.

33:42.674 --> 33:53.889
And he had money in Transamerican Court, Caterpillar, Bank of America, blue chip stocks.

33:53.969 --> 33:58.515
And so he specifically stipulated... Right.

33:58.575 --> 34:01.579
Well, actually, he stipulated, if you want the whole story, he stipulated two things.

34:01.639 --> 34:04.322
Half of it was to go to Golden Gate Park.

34:05.467 --> 34:08.410
for the further adornment of Golden Gate Park.

34:08.430 --> 34:10.452
And the other half was to go to the public library.

34:10.972 --> 34:12.554
Public parks and public libraries.

34:12.774 --> 34:14.696
Public parks and public libraries.

34:14.716 --> 34:19.781
Things that people would enjoy.

34:19.801 --> 34:21.523
That's right.

34:21.543 --> 34:21.703
And to?

34:21.823 --> 34:24.826
Not the opera, not the whatever.

34:24.846 --> 34:31.052
The art museum, the symphony, the public library, and the public park.

34:32.129 --> 34:36.755
It makes a statement, doesn't it?

34:37.576 --> 34:38.297
Yes, absolutely.

34:38.317 --> 34:49.311
And the part that went to the public library was to go for additional books on... For accusations?

34:49.351 --> 34:49.591
Yes.

34:50.272 --> 34:58.963
Well, what he said literally was additional books on political and economic subjects.

34:59.956 --> 35:13.288
and he says elsewhere in his writings that he wanted the working man to know about the system that they were living under.

35:13.308 --> 35:14.109
Geez, I like that.

35:14.690 --> 35:16.752
I mean, you can really provide him with some of his stuff.

35:16.912 --> 35:17.773
Oh, sure.

35:17.853 --> 35:23.037
I mean, I'll put him with a copy in class.

35:25.199 --> 35:26.721
Oh, yeah, no problem.

35:26.781 --> 35:28.022
So, what really happened

35:28.846 --> 35:31.790
was that they sold the property in San Francisco right away.

35:32.150 --> 35:34.153
They carried the cash in the stocks right away.

35:34.874 --> 35:36.656
They used the cash right away.

35:37.297 --> 35:39.519
And it was kind of sitting there doing nothing.

35:41.342 --> 35:47.029
And in the early 60s, they discovered oil on the Kern County property.

35:47.089 --> 35:48.851
Which they fortuitously still owned.

35:49.092 --> 35:51.935
Which they fortuitously still owned.

35:51.955 --> 35:57.402
So this started adding up to money pretty fast.

35:58.073 --> 36:05.983
At one point, right before all of this happened... I'm assuming he had no heirs.

36:06.063 --> 36:06.503
Yeah.

36:06.964 --> 36:10.288
Actually, that's kind of a long story, too, because he had no children.

36:10.668 --> 36:11.309
Never made.

36:12.531 --> 36:14.813
But he had a sister.

36:14.833 --> 36:21.441
So he must have provided for her as long as she never said anything like that.

36:21.461 --> 36:21.722
Or he didn't.

36:21.742 --> 36:23.324
No, he didn't.

36:23.344 --> 36:26.848
He tried to cut her out of his will, and his...

36:27.335 --> 36:35.082
Then brother-in-law actually sued and probed it to try to get a certain part of it.

36:35.102 --> 36:40.947
And actually once got something, got a piece.

36:41.648 --> 36:45.231
So in the 60s they discover oil, now they get more money.

36:45.251 --> 36:46.312
Right.

36:46.332 --> 36:51.817
And they start using it all through the 60s and 70s.

36:52.278 --> 36:55.941
So they did adhere to the stipulations.

36:57.018 --> 37:09.793
and actually it was getting so lucrative that at one point they were thinking about buying property in downtown San Francisco and calling up the firm on it, widely.

37:10.814 --> 37:14.198
And the city attorney told them they couldn't do that.

37:14.218 --> 37:15.860
There was four additional books.

37:18.283 --> 37:24.130
Which, so they were just buying books and everything was fine, until Dowling came along.

37:24.150 --> 37:26.653
And Dowling decided he was gonna use it

37:26.870 --> 37:30.235
Ask him about the family.

37:30.296 --> 37:34.382
Ask him about the family, yes.

37:35.424 --> 37:35.864
By all means.

37:35.885 --> 37:40.632
Have you decided to use the money except for computers and software and stuff like this?

37:40.652 --> 37:40.732
Yes.

37:40.752 --> 37:43.136
Business services, online databases.

37:43.156 --> 37:45.620
And how did you find out that he was doing?

37:45.780 --> 37:51.209
They passed a resolution in the open library community.

37:51.229 --> 37:52.371
So he filed soon.

37:53.161 --> 37:54.062
Well, yes.

37:54.443 --> 37:58.028
Basically, I said, you know, this is not to the terms of the trust.

37:58.048 --> 38:01.153
They ignored my letter, so I fired two.

38:01.173 --> 38:06.441
And the court found that I didn't have stumbling.

38:06.461 --> 38:06.601
Really?

38:06.761 --> 38:07.042
Yes.

38:07.062 --> 38:10.828
And you said this was when?

38:10.848 --> 38:13.892
This would have been... 1990.

38:15.675 --> 38:17.498
It's right after Darwin came in.

38:17.518 --> 38:20.963
About two years after Darwin came in, yeah.

38:21.363 --> 38:22.425
Three years after Darwin came in, yeah.

38:22.827 --> 38:29.116
I thought the public library was a public library.

38:29.136 --> 38:30.899
Well, that's what I'm trying to persuade you to say.

38:30.919 --> 38:33.963
You know, they've got a different attitude about that.

38:34.063 --> 38:37.609
Are you a taxpayer in the city of San Francisco?

38:37.629 --> 38:39.051
Are you living in the city of San Francisco?

38:39.151 --> 38:39.391
Yes.

38:40.052 --> 38:45.460
Well, I mean, if you want to get into the legal issues... Well, I'm trying to establish your standing is what I'm trying to do.

38:46.030 --> 38:49.935
Well, the court denied the standard.

38:50.396 --> 38:53.600
How did the court deny the standard?

38:53.921 --> 39:03.514
Well, their contention was that in the area of trust, the state attorney general has exclusive standard.

39:03.714 --> 39:04.174
Exclusive standard?

39:04.194 --> 39:05.176
Yes.

39:05.196 --> 39:08.921
The state attorney general chose not to protest.

39:08.941 --> 39:14.248
Well, at that time we didn't know that, that the attorney general was taking that position.

39:15.275 --> 39:22.225
You know, I felt, you know, based on the law at the time, that it was like a taxpayer's suit.

39:22.245 --> 39:27.533
They were misusing the property, why this has been given to the taxpayers.

39:27.553 --> 39:29.276
The taxpayers were the beneficiaries.

39:29.296 --> 39:30.598
I was a taxpayer.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.562
You know, they should be required to use this right.

39:34.604 --> 39:37.628
And actually, that's still kind of a fuzzy area of law.

39:38.229 --> 39:42.936
But they decided that the taxpayer's situation was overridden.

39:43.861 --> 39:45.944
by the trustee situation.

39:46.845 --> 40:05.473
Usually a trust for the public benefit is to a college somewhere, and they don't want every student who goes to the college to have standing in suit, so they give exclusive standing to the attorney general.

40:05.493 --> 40:11.742
But of course in this case, you know, there's that gray area where it's not certain whether

40:11.941 --> 40:20.094
the taxpayer, you know, suing for taxpayer rights or a beneficiary of the trust, suing for beneficiary rights.

40:20.114 --> 40:22.818
It's kind of a call you a little.

40:23.279 --> 40:24.360
So I sued.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.063
I was denied standard.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.667
I went to the Attorney General.

40:28.687 --> 40:29.589
The Attorney General.

40:29.909 --> 40:31.972
You went to Sacramento?

40:31.992 --> 40:35.878
I wrote a letter to Sacramento, yeah.

40:35.898 --> 40:36.660
So you wrote to the Attorney General?

40:36.680 --> 40:37.741
I wrote to the Attorney General.

40:37.841 --> 40:40.125
Got a letter back from the Attorney General saying,

40:41.489 --> 40:44.172
You know, this is the public arena.

40:44.212 --> 40:45.133
This is not our area.

40:46.394 --> 40:48.417
Taking the opposite view.

40:48.437 --> 40:49.998
But, you know, you're taxpayers.

40:50.058 --> 40:53.182
You've got nothing to do with, you know, beneficiaries, et cetera, et cetera.

40:53.983 --> 40:57.186
So with that letter in hand, I went back to the court.

40:58.608 --> 41:01.151
The court still did not understand me.

41:01.251 --> 41:09.640
So at that point, I went to Quentin Cobb, who's the local assemblyman, saying, you know, how do we resolve this contradiction?

41:11.527 --> 41:25.059
And he said, I don't know, we'll go to the legislative analyst, which is the legislative, the lawyer for the... So he may listen to you, please.

41:25.079 --> 41:25.179
Yeah.

41:25.199 --> 41:26.120
What's his name, C-L-A-T-T?

41:26.140 --> 41:27.521
No, no, a cop.

41:27.541 --> 41:28.121
K-O-T-T.

41:33.106 --> 41:34.727
Quentin, they said.

41:36.769 --> 41:37.269
Yes, Quentin.

41:37.770 --> 41:40.572
And so we got an opinion from the legislative analyst.

41:41.108 --> 41:51.877
to the fact that my remedy was to sue the state attorney general for not doing this job, which I did.

41:51.897 --> 42:09.833
And in response to that suit, the state attorney general admitted that they went to the city at that point and said, if you're going to continue to do this, you better change the trust, change the terms of trust.

42:09.853 --> 42:11.014
And so the city did that.

42:11.990 --> 42:20.484
in effect admitting that they had to change the trust and continue to do what they were doing.

42:20.544 --> 42:32.243
But unfortunately, the court allowed them to change the terms of the trust, which I still think was wrong.

42:32.881 --> 42:37.766
By that time, it must have been late 93, early 94.

42:37.886 --> 42:39.868
So therefore, they used the money now to go on?

42:40.088 --> 42:51.599
They used the money for four continuous years to do whatever, and were retroactively indemnified, basically, by the exchange in terms of the trust.

42:51.619 --> 42:53.981
Did you steal money in the trust now?

42:54.001 --> 42:54.181
Oh, yeah.

42:54.201 --> 43:01.588
Actually, the income in the trust now is up around $300,000 a year.

43:03.053 --> 43:10.941
And a crucial part to the story is they changed the wording from books.

43:10.961 --> 43:14.485
The original it said additional books.

43:14.505 --> 43:22.854
They changed the wording so it said additional books and materials and other formats.

43:22.874 --> 43:30.422
And based on that change, they spent all of the money on computer science.

43:30.442 --> 43:31.643
How do you know this?

43:32.264 --> 43:33.426
It's in the budget.

43:33.446 --> 43:36.750
You know, there's still got to be in the public budget.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.337
It's in the budget.

43:41.357 --> 43:44.962
And just for the sake of the record, what's wrong with that?

43:45.844 --> 43:49.128
Well, I mean, a lot of things.

43:49.309 --> 43:54.476
First of all, it perverts what he wanted.

43:54.496 --> 43:55.858
You know, he wanted books.

43:56.395 --> 44:00.380
that there were no computers in there.

44:00.400 --> 44:04.785
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

44:05.446 --> 44:08.049
You're just asking me to articulate.

44:08.910 --> 44:10.812
Yes, I understand.

44:10.832 --> 44:11.613
Nothing bad at me.

44:11.633 --> 44:11.953
This is my joke.

44:11.973 --> 44:12.454
Right.

44:12.474 --> 44:26.250
I mean, one of the crucial aspects of the suit is I was contending that not only did they violate the terms book, you know, things other than books, but they also violated the term additional.

44:26.585 --> 44:33.678
in that they were replacing city funds with trust funds.

44:33.878 --> 44:49.366
But just on the face of it, the term poor means a lot of things.

44:49.406 --> 44:50.989
When this whole thing first started,

44:51.577 --> 45:04.737
Somebody asked me if they were just using it on CD-ROMs, you know, book-like materials on CD-ROMs, would I object?

45:04.877 --> 45:08.542
And at that point I said no.

45:08.562 --> 45:12.769
I said, you know, CD-ROMs are, you know, vehicles for information that people read.

45:13.790 --> 45:19.018
You know, it's close enough to what a book is, you know, that I wouldn't get excited about that.

45:20.264 --> 45:23.668
In fact, they were using it on the computers themselves.

45:23.688 --> 45:27.853
They were using it on what they called business services.

45:27.873 --> 45:30.717
They were using it on online services.

45:30.777 --> 45:50.220
They were using it on all kinds of ephemeral electronic gadgetry that wasn't educational material at all, but, you know, everything from stock quotes to, you know, just all kinds of stuff.

45:52.141 --> 45:55.085
And they had perverted the guy's intention.

45:55.165 --> 46:08.505
They went around saying that, well, economics is business, therefore he's a business benefit, yet in fact he's been a labor guy.

46:11.149 --> 46:19.060
But after I got into this, I realized that there are all kinds of things about a quality of a book

46:20.052 --> 46:27.622
That's got nothing to do with computers.

46:27.642 --> 46:40.057
I mean, the mere fact that the form of a book... They go to the opera, yeah.

46:40.077 --> 46:46.245
Yeah, it's kind of like, especially during the opera season, it's kind of like a pre-opera crowd.

46:47.221 --> 46:55.810
There's a lot of issues that have to do with preservability.

46:55.830 --> 47:10.967
I mean, if you took your, I don't know, your Apple One, or your, I mean, there's a lot of computers.

47:12.078 --> 47:17.565
that they're outdated because they're five years old.

47:18.326 --> 47:23.052
But a book doesn't go out of date in five years.

47:23.072 --> 47:28.559
So just on that issue alone, if the guy said books, you know, he might have had a good reason.

47:28.579 --> 47:35.889
But more than that, when people give them money, they do it through their own vision, their own values.

47:37.751 --> 47:38.592
You know, they don't give it

47:39.398 --> 47:59.126
for Mr. Dowling's values, except that, you know, I really don't remember a case in there.

47:59.146 --> 48:02.010
Wills are broken, 1670 years after the fact, and we've got Wills and the government that were written before the Civil War, you know, or deeds.

48:02.030 --> 48:02.871
I've read dozens of them in Massachusetts.

48:02.891 --> 48:05.575
You know, the person says specifically prohibit sale of this property, correct, to anyone other than the member of the Caucasian race.

48:06.753 --> 48:12.081
Well, that's the person's wish, but guess what?

48:12.141 --> 48:12.883
That's thrown out.

48:13.183 --> 48:15.066
Well, yes, it's certainly arguable.

48:16.188 --> 48:19.293
I mean, I admit that this part of it is certainly arguable.

48:19.613 --> 48:29.508
Because technology times do change, and the dead don't necessarily have the same rights they're living to.

48:29.528 --> 48:30.550
Yes, absolutely right.

48:31.306 --> 48:43.581
So, you know, I'm just saying that, you know, there's an argument to be made that, hey, there were no computers then.

48:43.601 --> 48:52.572
I don't agree with the virtual library, but, you know, if the argument is made that this is where a library is going and the man has the interest, the best interest of the library, and this is what we're doing, we're not using the money to go out and

48:52.552 --> 49:07.452
you know, repair the paper tires or something like that when they came into the money to improve the live work.

49:07.472 --> 49:08.714
That's the argument that they make.

49:08.734 --> 49:10.876
Whether they did or whether they did, that's a subjective judgment.

49:10.896 --> 49:14.321
Yes, I understand completely.

49:14.341 --> 49:21.090
Well, one of the things you have to realize is that that is the view I would have taken when this whole thing started.

49:22.117 --> 49:35.273
I would have said, well, I mean, if you've got a CD-ROM encyclopedia, that's close enough to the court that we don't need to quibble about whether it's on paper or whether it's on paper.

49:35.313 --> 49:37.996
They started getting hardware, is what you said.

49:38.016 --> 49:38.957
They started getting hardware.

49:38.977 --> 49:44.344
As a matter of fact, $600,000 a firmament fund was in the debt contract that your equipment corporation had.

49:46.535 --> 49:59.177
You see, now I agree with you.

49:59.197 --> 50:03.525
The money was starting to realize their vision of what a library is.

50:04.927 --> 50:05.128
Good.

50:05.148 --> 50:07.311
Is that it in the nutshell?

50:07.331 --> 50:07.472
Yes.

50:07.492 --> 50:08.273
And at a time...

50:08.962 --> 50:13.087
when Mr. Furman's vision was still valid.

50:13.167 --> 50:34.391
I mean, if they closed down the library, I mean, if a hundred years from now they closed down the building and everybody in the world, you know, knew the library through the internet, well then maybe at that point you can say that Mr. Furman's vision was out of date and it was time to change it.

50:34.952 --> 50:35.813
But still,

50:36.181 --> 50:43.828
We're talking about a time when 98% of the people still schlepped down to their local library to get a book.

50:44.500 --> 51:03.407
You know, this is not a time when Mr. Fuhrman's vision was outdated.

51:03.427 --> 51:12.820
Not only that, but according to your reading of Fuhrman's book, he quite emphatically stated that this money is to help become an individual, a working man, a woman, a discotheby, people who can't afford to go to peace, to go to holiday, the next door, the mail, blah, blah, blah.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.461
And what do you think?

51:13.880 --> 51:19.647
And what they do and run seems to run counter to that philosophy.

51:19.667 --> 51:21.349
They were using it.

51:21.369 --> 51:25.394
So, stockbrokers can get their stockbrokers.

51:25.414 --> 51:33.344
You see, the spirit of what the man had in mind, even if it's not a book that's even wrong, it's fine.

51:33.504 --> 51:38.470
If you go into the poor neighborhood and teach a black kid who's computer illiterate, they can computer illiterate books.

51:38.450 --> 51:57.554
Then again, if you expand the hours, if you make it easier to eat, because as you say, you're pleasing, you know, getting instant accessibility to the Dow Jones and standard reports and all the other stuff.

51:57.574 --> 51:59.877
This is not the spirit of us that you ain't had money.

51:59.897 --> 52:00.658
Still, he died in 1939.

52:00.678 --> 52:02.580
He drafted his will in 1938.

52:02.600 --> 52:05.224
He was a probate lawyer.

52:05.244 --> 52:07.967
There was teletype in his day.

52:08.437 --> 52:10.920
There were phonograph records in his day.

52:10.940 --> 52:12.763
There were tape recordings in his day.

52:13.323 --> 52:17.729
If he wanted to say, you know, my will... Audiovisual.

52:18.150 --> 52:20.112
Yeah, audiovisual.

52:20.633 --> 52:22.095
Films.

52:22.175 --> 52:22.515
Records.

52:22.535 --> 52:24.098
Photographic.

52:24.158 --> 52:29.044
Yeah, if he wanted to say, my will includes all those things.

52:29.733 --> 52:32.296
He could have done that.

52:32.316 --> 52:33.518
He didn't do that.

52:33.538 --> 52:34.799
He said books.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.821
That's great.

52:35.841 --> 52:36.281
I like this.

52:36.501 --> 52:40.166
I'd love to see some paperwork.

52:40.186 --> 52:40.506
Sure.

52:41.027 --> 52:43.050
I've got lots of stuff.

52:43.130 --> 52:43.851
Don't be shy.

52:43.871 --> 52:46.394
The more paperwork for me, the better I can.

52:46.414 --> 52:54.644
All right, so let's now go to this organization, which is the original library.

52:54.664 --> 52:54.864
Right.

52:56.506 --> 52:57.507
It's not an organization.

52:57.527 --> 52:57.968
It's just me.

52:58.673 --> 53:22.143
Well, you know how all this started is they used to have a staff newsletter.

53:22.183 --> 53:27.550
The actual staff had a newsletter called the official bulletin.

53:28.795 --> 53:29.896
It came out once a week.

53:31.377 --> 53:35.381
And actually, they decommissioned it for a variety of reasons.

53:35.401 --> 53:38.624
Basically, it was critical of Marjorie Stern.

53:38.644 --> 53:44.729
And the guy who ran it was a bit too clever.

53:44.749 --> 53:50.774
So they decided that they would decommission it and run this guy out of the job.

53:51.875 --> 53:55.378
So when they dropped it, I picked it up.

53:56.399 --> 53:57.520
It's called mine.

53:57.736 --> 54:02.384
the original official bullet.

54:02.404 --> 54:08.896
Kind of, you know, keeping up that whole thing of tradition, yeah.

54:08.916 --> 54:19.795
And so, having called it the original official bulletin, I just took the original card and made it the original library.

54:20.163 --> 54:47.280
No.

54:47.300 --> 54:48.381
Well, first of all, I feel that history vindicated me.

54:49.019 --> 55:00.775
I mean, if you really go back and look at everything they said, which made it necessary to build that building, history has proved that all those things were wise.

55:02.016 --> 55:06.682
I mean, I said they were wise, and history has proved they were all wise.

55:06.782 --> 55:12.230
So in that sense, I've been vindicated.

55:12.250 --> 55:14.413
There's another reason why I think I'm willing.

55:14.433 --> 55:16.275
I think most people recognize

55:18.263 --> 55:24.690
that this was a modern urban planning disaster.

55:24.710 --> 55:46.093
That you can't take something for the public benefit and create a public, quote, public-private partnership to design and run it, and then expect that the public uses of it

55:47.103 --> 55:51.068
will be respected or successful.

55:51.088 --> 55:53.392
I mean, that didn't happen.

55:53.412 --> 56:03.265
They ran it, designed it, created it for the benefit of these private-public partnerships.

56:03.285 --> 56:04.727
It was a conversion, basically.

56:04.747 --> 56:11.697
They took something that was a public asset and turned it into a private asset.

56:11.717 --> 56:14.140
It was a conversion.

56:15.537 --> 56:29.679
And to the extent that people know that story, I think our position's been vindicated.

56:29.699 --> 56:30.921
Okay, what's next?

56:30.941 --> 56:32.483
What's next?

56:33.205 --> 56:38.013
Yes, continue the battle.

56:38.093 --> 56:48.970
Well, you know, I still consider the influence of the foundation too great.

56:48.990 --> 56:51.094
I think we have to neutralize the foundation.

56:52.316 --> 57:00.529
There's still a lot of public access issues, you know, open meetings issues, vindication of the public

57:01.285 --> 57:03.088
position.

57:03.329 --> 57:14.147
All of those are still issues that are living issues.

57:14.167 --> 57:19.176
I'm eventually looking forward to the time when I'll be

57:20.540 --> 57:30.693
kind of diplomacied in for like a little bit of time.

57:30.713 --> 57:39.445
Well, eventually, uh, Malcolm Baker, you know, started out as a radical, right?

57:39.565 --> 57:40.506
And eventually it turned.

57:40.526 --> 57:41.367
It doesn't turn, yeah.

57:41.802 --> 57:52.997
And eventually the political shift moves to such an extent that he becomes like a pillar of the community, becomes, you know, a participant.

57:53.017 --> 58:09.278
You know, I'm looking forward to the time when he's going to move back so far into the public, cultural, literary axis of the People's University that I will become like a respectable citizen again.

58:10.304 --> 58:12.989
You know, I'm looking forward to that time.

58:13.009 --> 58:15.213
And you go to all the meetings?

58:15.473 --> 58:15.994
I go to all the meetings.

58:16.014 --> 58:18.478
Do they let you speak?

58:18.578 --> 58:21.604
For a long time they didn't, but they have recently.

58:21.624 --> 58:22.605
They have recently, yes.

58:22.946 --> 58:25.050
Do they respond to you or just listen to you?

58:25.070 --> 58:28.235
Just listen to me.

58:28.255 --> 58:29.718
There's a lot of progress.

58:29.758 --> 58:31.541
They used to not let me speak at all.

58:31.561 --> 58:32.443
And you get your three minutes?

58:32.543 --> 58:33.865
I get my three minutes.

58:35.515 --> 58:39.761
Yes, which is actually progress to this matter.

58:39.781 --> 58:45.650
Are you an angry man?

58:45.670 --> 58:45.830
Oh yeah.

58:45.850 --> 58:47.753
I don't know why I wouldn't.

58:47.773 --> 58:49.376
I chose it myself.

58:49.396 --> 58:50.618
I've got nobody to blame.

58:55.064 --> 58:57.608
So that was back in 1975.

58:58.870 --> 59:17.043
And something happened if you haven't really been that simple.

59:17.063 --> 59:17.163
Yeah.

59:17.183 --> 59:18.025
And you physically went into the long run?

59:18.045 --> 59:18.145
Yeah.

59:18.165 --> 59:19.247
On a given day or something different if you remember?

59:19.267 --> 59:19.367
Well.

59:19.387 --> 59:19.948
Yeah, I'm coming back to it.

59:19.968 --> 59:20.930
First of all, I want to know what you're saying.

59:20.950 --> 59:21.872
I'm just going to turn this on the other side.

59:21.892 --> 59:21.992
Okay?
