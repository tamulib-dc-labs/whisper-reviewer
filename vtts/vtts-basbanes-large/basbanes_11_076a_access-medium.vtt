WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:32.839
we're talking about Otto may have been Otto may have been the first person to have realized that you could license the use of a photograph and you still had the photograph I mean the whole sense of oh wait a minute you mean I sold it and I still have it I think he really so in a way he is and without really owning it either well also without even owning it that's right I mean you can

00:34.135 --> 00:40.243
I mean, as Laurie was pointing out earlier, it's non-exclusive use, right?

00:40.263 --> 00:40.664
I guess.

00:40.744 --> 00:40.964
Right.

00:41.265 --> 00:45.330
Well, for Corvus, it's a mixture.

00:45.811 --> 00:53.682
I would say that there are today something like 425 sources in the Corvus archive, in the Corvus collection.

00:54.483 --> 01:02.674
Of those 425, I don't have the exact numbers, but probably high 300s of them are

01:03.278 --> 01:05.821
are non-exclusive licensing.

01:05.841 --> 01:09.885
A small group of maybe 30 or 40 are purchases.

01:11.066 --> 01:15.111
They're very important, and one of them is the Bettman Archive.

01:15.131 --> 01:23.379
Another one is the work of the photojournalist David and Peter Turnley that was announced over in the last two weeks.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.623
How do you spell his name?

01:26.643 --> 01:27.243
T-U-R-N-L-E-Y.

01:27.444 --> 01:30.687
In fact, Turnleys have been

01:31.493 --> 01:42.007
I believe, more covered in the New York Times and other publications, not only for the work they have photographed, but also about them.

01:42.228 --> 01:47.295
I mean, they're richly, if you did a search... This was in the last couple of weeks of the Times?

01:48.396 --> 01:57.569
Well, no, the Times actually carried the purchases as a small story, because they had been focusing so much on the turnways.

01:57.649 --> 01:58.530
It was an exhibition.

01:59.017 --> 02:02.642
that they have at the International Center of Photography that I think is still open.

02:02.662 --> 02:04.064
Okay, I know what you're talking about.

02:04.304 --> 02:11.134
And the pictures that you would recognize from Tiananmen Square are from them.

02:11.835 --> 02:14.578
They've won every prize that one can win.

02:15.380 --> 02:22.670
And, of course, they have a million and a half photographs that they've taken over their 20-plus years.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.193
I'll check it out.

02:25.612 --> 02:38.069
The New York Times actually didn't make as big a story out of it as they did out of the Bettman purchase, in part because of the fact that the Turnleys had gotten so much ink on their own previously.

02:38.169 --> 02:41.394
Also, there is a resonance to Bettman.

02:41.434 --> 02:43.236
It astounded me that he was alive.

02:44.158 --> 02:48.383
I've seen Bettman archives stuff for as long as I can remember.

02:49.064 --> 02:52.429
It never occurred to me that this was put together by a living person.

02:52.865 --> 02:57.051
Have you ever seen A Portable Batman, a book called A Portable Batman?

02:57.131 --> 02:59.895
Otto showed me his own copy of it.

03:00.496 --> 03:01.037
Do you want one?

03:01.297 --> 03:02.719
I'd love one.

03:02.739 --> 03:05.202
I would really... Wow.

03:05.603 --> 03:11.271
You know, what just occurred to me is... Why don't... You know, I've talked to Otto on the phone.

03:11.311 --> 03:18.902
Why don't you call Otto, if you would, for me, Laurie, and simply say that... I mean, actually, you referenced this meeting.

03:18.922 --> 03:19.663
I'm sure he remembers.

03:19.683 --> 03:19.783
Sure.

03:19.949 --> 03:28.745
And say, you know, it occurred to us that it might be useful for him to have a small number of copies of.

03:28.765 --> 03:29.807
Could we do that?

03:29.847 --> 03:30.848
And then half a dozen.

03:30.868 --> 03:32.752
He didn't have any.

03:32.872 --> 03:33.734
Oh, yeah, we'll fix that.

03:34.375 --> 03:40.045
And he gave me a couple of other books, you know, the book that he did that he gave to the Library of Congress.

03:40.065 --> 03:40.185
Right.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.565
Wonderful.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.848
He's just a delight to be with Fitch there.

03:44.868 --> 03:45.488
Well, he did.

03:45.849 --> 03:46.149
Wow.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.432
One of the books that I have that he did.

03:48.533 --> 03:48.873
Thank you.

03:49.314 --> 03:49.854
You're welcome.

03:49.874 --> 03:50.415
That's great.

03:51.276 --> 03:51.977
We love that.

03:52.458 --> 04:10.122
And the production of that's an interesting story when the company which was called Bettman after, you know, got out of that business in 1980 and the Krauss organization built it up from what was

04:10.321 --> 04:12.023
A relatively small business.

04:12.183 --> 04:13.204
Three million photographs.

04:13.224 --> 04:15.707
They added UPI and some other collections.

04:15.727 --> 04:27.519
And they decided that they could produce this and make money selling it.

04:27.539 --> 04:32.164
The problem is that they kind of went into the book business.

04:32.184 --> 04:36.328
And the beauty of this thing, and also the ugliness of it, is

04:36.747 --> 04:41.191
It works as a catalog, but it's too damn expensive as a catalog.

04:42.152 --> 04:46.296
And it turns out that they never figured out the marketing of it as a book.

04:46.316 --> 04:46.917
You mean Krause?

04:47.157 --> 04:47.878
Krause did.

04:48.338 --> 04:55.625
And so the guy who produced that, who was the director, his name is David Greenstein, was really, it was his child.

04:57.467 --> 05:04.273
Producing that was so costly for them that it damn near cost them his job, and he ended up being out of there.

05:05.274 --> 05:05.995
And it's because...

05:06.548 --> 05:13.778
This thing came sort of in that abyss between something that you could really sell, although I think you could have sold it.

05:13.818 --> 05:16.081
I think if it had been marketed... It's magnificent.

05:16.161 --> 05:17.042
It's amazing.

05:18.905 --> 05:35.307
The first time that I raised the idea with Bill Gates about... I tested him out on whether... See, at Corvus, we had started... I had known Herb Gestalter, who was the director of Vetements,

05:35.692 --> 05:38.956
and who's married to a Krauss and is the head of the Krauss organization today.

05:39.336 --> 05:40.618
He's the director of Bettman today.

05:41.539 --> 05:42.620
How do you spell his name?

05:43.041 --> 05:45.083
G-S-T-A-L-D-E-R.

05:46.164 --> 05:47.946
And I've known Herb.

05:48.026 --> 05:51.570
Herb and I, I lived in Chabaclar, New York, for 13 years.

05:51.791 --> 05:52.652
Herb lives there.

05:53.513 --> 05:56.476
Herb's best friend is a close friend of mine in IBM.

05:56.797 --> 06:01.402
So we knew each other, but we really intersected through a third person.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.045
I actually now lives in Dallas.

06:04.463 --> 06:11.992
I started talking to Herb about possibly licensing from Bettman on a non-exclusive, you know, licensing basis.

06:12.012 --> 06:16.578
And then it progressed along, and then it became clear to me that there was an opportunity.

06:16.778 --> 06:22.024
And so when I raised it with Bill Gates, I brought that book in to the meeting that I have.

06:22.685 --> 06:23.866
He got lost in the book.

06:24.647 --> 06:28.832
He started, it was actually very interesting.

06:29.653 --> 06:31.095
He spent 10 or 15 minutes

06:31.413 --> 06:33.275
And it's like one of those ones, should I stay?

06:33.295 --> 06:34.236
Should I leave?

06:34.556 --> 06:35.978
And you get really engrossed in it.

06:36.359 --> 06:37.139
They can comment.

06:37.159 --> 06:37.820
It's very funny.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.361
It's nice.

06:39.082 --> 06:43.546
But anyway, you started by saying that Otto basically pioneered this whole concept.

06:43.567 --> 06:43.807
Right.

06:43.907 --> 06:44.928
I think that he did.

06:45.429 --> 06:47.671
I mean... Of the licensing.

06:47.691 --> 06:49.053
Of the licensing.

06:49.073 --> 06:50.654
The ability to license.

06:50.674 --> 07:00.205
By the way, whether you own or license, I think at Corvus, probably half of what in quantity is in the archive we're going to own, and half

07:00.691 --> 07:02.694
either own or it's going to be public domain.

07:04.016 --> 07:05.658
That's another actually important point.

07:05.878 --> 07:11.306
That's right, but what's to stop somebody like myself from going to the Library of Congress and getting something that's available?

07:11.426 --> 07:17.455
Nothing, except that you won't spend the time doing it, and you won't spend the cost doing it.

07:17.535 --> 07:19.017
You'll pay us a fee rather than do that.

07:19.037 --> 07:29.632
Well, when Otto was looking at my book, and I've got some pretty wonderful illustrations in it, which I researched, acquired, I was telling Laurie, you know, paid good money to get, blah, blah.

07:29.733 --> 07:30.073
Otto said,

07:30.492 --> 07:32.694
You did all this yourself?

07:32.754 --> 07:33.855
He says, you should have come to us.

07:33.915 --> 07:36.718
We could have done the whole thing for you.

07:36.738 --> 07:38.920
Convenience.

07:39.520 --> 07:39.901
Who knew?

07:39.981 --> 07:40.521
I didn't know.

07:40.822 --> 07:47.408
I contacted the British Library, the British Museum, wherever to get these illustrations.

07:47.428 --> 07:48.769
Well, there's an interesting thing.

07:49.049 --> 07:53.593
I am a lover of books.

07:56.236 --> 07:58.778
My wife and I have

08:01.222 --> 08:09.430
I was almost going to say too many books, but when we moved up here from California, I think we had 90 cartons of books.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.232
So, you know, we're a big move.

08:12.332 --> 08:19.579
Somebody moves us, it's a serious... We're afraid to move because moving with books would be impossible.

08:19.599 --> 08:30.469
And when we left California, we also made a decision that novels were not keepers, so that the books that we kept this 90...

08:30.787 --> 08:34.352
cases were basically reference of various types.

08:34.372 --> 08:36.115
And my wife uses them constantly.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.316
I use them slightly less.

08:37.336 --> 08:38.338
So it's a working library.

08:38.378 --> 08:39.439
It's a working library.

08:39.539 --> 08:43.185
And it's, you know, I mean, she's in it all the time.

08:43.605 --> 08:51.817
In fact, she gave David Fite, she had a copy of the new Stockstead History of Art, and they had given me one.

08:51.837 --> 08:55.442
And she said, I've got to get another one of those, because she loaned it to somebody.

08:55.482 --> 08:56.404
She said, I use that.

08:57.265 --> 08:59.107
I mean, and that's, of course, the beauty.

08:59.288 --> 08:59.528
Now,

09:00.453 --> 09:13.190
when you move from the basis, I agree with you, and this isn't a gratuitous comment, I agree with you on the importance of books.

09:14.352 --> 09:26.749
I also believe that books are not in any great danger of becoming less important in the near future anyway.

09:26.769 --> 09:29.953
But what I think the electronic can afford is

09:30.237 --> 09:44.252
is kind of a new perspective on the same material that ideally will be used in a complimentary way to books, or in a complimentary way.

09:45.113 --> 09:58.708
So, when you go to a library, and as we all did through college, and you've been researching in a library probably more recently than I have, you know,

09:59.110 --> 10:04.235
Researching in a library in terms of the way the information is organized is really a hit-and-miss kind of a deal.

10:04.295 --> 10:05.917
You go down a lot of black holes.

10:06.117 --> 10:08.700
I mean, a lot of... Well, they're kind of fun sometimes, too.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.341
It is fun.

10:09.561 --> 10:10.081
It is fun.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.483
But it depends upon your time.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.266
Serendipity, I think, is the most exciting thing.

10:14.546 --> 10:19.111
And actually, I've learned that you can do serendipity on a computer, too.

10:19.291 --> 10:19.531
Right.

10:20.032 --> 10:20.472
I'm sorry.

10:20.753 --> 10:21.293
No, it's okay.

10:21.373 --> 10:22.615
No.

10:22.635 --> 10:26.839
But, you know, I'm an old-style library researcher, but before I go into...

10:27.157 --> 10:40.994
Cambridge to work at the Widener Library, I call up the Hollis online, you know, computer catalog of 13.5 million titles, find out precisely what I'm looking for, where it's located, so I don't fool around when I get to the library.

10:41.014 --> 10:44.178
I go right in, go straight to the stacks, and get the books that I'm looking for.

10:44.398 --> 10:49.244
You know, I mean, I use the computer in a way that, for my home.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.205
That's right.

10:50.225 --> 10:53.149
So, I mean, I don't know if that's what you're alluding to.

10:53.269 --> 10:56.353
Well, what I'm alluding to is that, is that, uh,

10:57.903 --> 11:06.430
See, I don't think the information in books is very accessible electronically.

11:06.451 --> 11:07.612
I mean, it is and it isn't.

11:07.652 --> 11:09.033
Some parts of it are, some parts of it not.

11:09.053 --> 11:14.938
I just put the data out at Stanford, and I can see whether online is absolutely going to be essential.

11:15.078 --> 11:15.538
Good go.

11:15.639 --> 11:18.021
And the books aren't good.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.622
Yes, and science.

11:20.062 --> 11:26.408
And journals where they'll only publish 1,000 of them at best that will cost $150 for these monographs.

11:26.708 --> 11:29.311
And they'll be obsolete the day they're published.

11:29.331 --> 11:30.191
Now it's all there.

11:30.612 --> 11:31.312
You punch in.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.654
You can update it at will.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.356
Download precisely the parts that you need.

11:36.297 --> 11:41.082
I mean, how can a printed book beat that, I wonder?

11:41.703 --> 11:46.587
But then again, we're talking about literature and works of the imagination.

11:47.568 --> 11:56.597
See, I think the purpose they serve needs to be thought of as entirely different.

11:57.016 --> 12:09.394
In fact, if you really set out to do electronically what a book does, you can, on the surface, do it, but it's not a very positive experience.

12:09.474 --> 12:20.691
I don't think that material laid out as a book is laid out is not meant to be read on a computer screen, and I think that people will lose patience with it pretty quickly.

12:20.711 --> 12:25.538
I think, on the other hand, you can do things in a computer that

12:25.805 --> 12:28.448
you can't do in print.

12:28.468 --> 12:42.761
For example, within A Passion for Art, Curtis had the idea, when you go through reading the bibliographies of the artists and a painting is referred to, you simply click on it and you get the painting.

12:42.782 --> 12:44.383
Yeah, but you actually see them in the index.

12:44.523 --> 12:46.065
And then you see them in the index.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.126
And you see them in the index.

12:47.186 --> 12:52.031
So, I call that, in the bibliography, I call that illustrate on the fly.

12:53.532 --> 12:54.613
You know, where, in effect,

12:55.420 --> 13:01.027
We subscribed to National Geographic from 1962 to 1993.

13:01.047 --> 13:11.941
When we sold our house in California, Liz said, and she regrets it now, she said, the National Geographics are not moving again.

13:13.123 --> 13:14.104
We gave them to a school.

13:15.266 --> 13:18.330
They're really happy.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.033
But by the way, it turns out they aren't very valuable.

13:21.454 --> 13:22.094
No, that's right.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.077
Because everybody has kept all of them.

13:24.850 --> 13:28.913
Well, there's a dealer who actually is going to nand every week.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.635
Oh, he's looking for the collection.

13:31.356 --> 13:33.397
But he won't pay a lot.

13:33.477 --> 13:34.919
He's given a quarter, a copy.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.180
Yeah, that's right.

13:36.220 --> 13:40.483
He's probably not doing a... The school will probably get much more use out of it.

13:40.503 --> 13:42.185
Well, yeah, the school... You did the right thing.

13:42.285 --> 13:53.474
In fact, the school we picked was in Millbury, in California, and it was a school that was economically one that would really benefit from it.

13:53.494 --> 13:54.435
I mean, it was good, fun.

13:55.040 --> 14:00.328
But I won't go down this track.

14:00.368 --> 14:01.610
Maybe Curtis talked about it.

14:01.691 --> 14:10.485
But I think most of the people who have published electronically have tried to bring the book publishing paradigm into the electronic.

14:11.086 --> 14:12.348
And I don't think it works there.

14:13.710 --> 14:22.043
But I think that if you sort of start from scratch, as we did with A Passion for Art and our other titles, then I think you could do some things

14:22.985 --> 14:24.848
Did Curtis show you Da Vinci?

14:24.868 --> 14:26.470
Did he show you that he did?

14:26.550 --> 14:28.192
I can't wait to see the finished.

14:28.273 --> 14:33.139
You know, I think that little thing, I don't know what else to call it.

14:33.160 --> 14:33.800
A codoscope.

14:33.861 --> 14:34.822
Yeah, we call it a codoscope.

14:34.842 --> 14:37.806
What he did is really an inspiration.

14:38.367 --> 14:38.507
Right.

14:38.527 --> 14:40.049
It's brilliant.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.473
It's brilliant, but it makes so much sense when you see it.

14:42.753 --> 14:43.034
I know.

14:43.274 --> 14:51.726
But you have to understand the technology and the potential of the technology and what it can do for you that nothing else that we know of could possibly do.

14:52.162 --> 14:56.046
There's a major project that IBM has underway at the Vatican Library.

14:57.107 --> 15:06.177
And there's a manager at IBM who, his IBM life is managing 300 people, but his passion is this project that IBM has at the Vatican.

15:06.257 --> 15:13.644
And the Vatican Library, through a priest named Father Boyle, has just opened up to IBM and this project.

15:13.965 --> 15:14.545
It's amazing.

15:15.606 --> 15:22.033
The guy running that project and the whole team that, I don't know if you saw the mail on it today, Laurie,

15:22.267 --> 15:28.376
are coming to Corvus because they want to license the Kodascope to use with the manuscript there.

15:28.396 --> 15:31.460
Oh, so you patented the Kodascope?

15:31.480 --> 15:38.109
Well, we patented the technology, and we've trademarked or copywritten the name, but the name is more tied to a Kodax.

15:38.129 --> 15:40.913
I mean, the name isn't as important as the method is.

15:40.973 --> 15:45.780
The method by giving you a transliteration and a translation.

15:46.241 --> 15:46.461
Right.

15:46.601 --> 15:51.328
I was in, Monday, I was in Bonn, Germany, and

15:52.000 --> 15:59.269
Jay Carter Brown, who is the former director of the National Gallery, director of emeritus, and he's on the advisory board at Corvus.

16:00.250 --> 16:12.565
And I spoke in a conference that the German Ministry of Education and Research and Technology held on the kind of the future of information and the information highway.

16:12.585 --> 16:20.995
500 people, you know, the heads of all the big publishing houses and the head of the

16:21.295 --> 16:30.205
PTT in Germany and Italy, and what I showed them, because of the way they managed time, I had ten minutes.

16:30.245 --> 16:47.204
And Carter sort of wrapped me, I mean, he started and then introduced me, and Carter's whole message was to say that, which is the same one that I believe, is, digital never improves on the original.

16:47.825 --> 16:49.767
This is actually a quote of mine that he picked up, but

16:50.033 --> 16:54.617
Digital never improves on the original, but it does enhance our understanding of the subject.

16:55.618 --> 17:09.331
So don't confuse the fact that digital is ever going to be better than Renoir's Luncheon Before the Voting Party or something, which is at the Phillips in Washington.

17:09.351 --> 17:10.672
I love the painting.

17:10.693 --> 17:17.559
You know, digital, there's no way, I don't care where you go with flat screens and the rest, it's not going to equal.

17:18.380 --> 17:18.640
But

17:19.042 --> 17:32.253
What you can do with digital, and what I did with that group in Bond, is within the title, there's a timeline, and the Mona Lisa is there, and I went in and zoomed on it and scrolled around on it.

17:32.273 --> 17:38.879
And having seen the Mona Lisa, they were looking at the Mona Lisa closer up than they can see it in the Louvre.

17:38.899 --> 17:39.520
Which I've seen.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.702
I mean, there's a crowd of people that's behind glass.

17:41.722 --> 17:43.323
Oh, God, they have it so set up.

17:43.903 --> 17:48.087
Yeah, and it's not... As a matter of fact, what I did...

17:48.421 --> 17:52.787
And every now and then, you know, maybe it's serendipity, I was just lucky.

17:53.508 --> 17:57.653
I said, you know, suppose you want to go down, and your real interest are her hands.

17:58.855 --> 18:00.437
I had more people come up to me after.

18:00.457 --> 18:04.723
They loved that, because so much is the smile on the face.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.747
And I went, and the hands are exquisite that are in that.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.469
But you can't see them.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.691
You can't see them.

18:10.711 --> 18:17.820
Well, and I'm just thinking of all the other, the famous drawings of hands and things, and how there's a launch pad for someone...

18:18.070 --> 18:22.234
in the digital media to look at other hands by Leonardo.

18:22.574 --> 18:26.998
Well, it's a way of tracing the creative process, which, as they will tell you, it's like manuscripts.

18:27.819 --> 18:31.062
The creative process doesn't begin with the published text.

18:31.122 --> 18:38.388
It begins with the drafts and the drafts and the manuscripts, and the same thing with the working sketches of hands or anything else.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.150
You see how they arrived at the final solution.

18:41.491 --> 18:47.436
Boy, another thing you could do if you're talking about the Vatican, imagine if you had the photos of the

18:47.821 --> 18:55.391
the chapel ceiling prior and then afterwards and how you could use your scope to show what they did.

18:55.411 --> 18:59.196
By the way, all that exists.

19:00.117 --> 19:01.298
Meaning the photographs exist.

19:01.359 --> 19:05.103
I'm sure the photographs do, but I'm saying what you could do... Oh, you could just scan them.

19:05.744 --> 19:09.069
You could come up with some kind of thing that would show how it would be easy.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.632
Oh, that's trivial.

19:11.652 --> 19:12.753
Piece of cake, right?

19:13.034 --> 19:17.119
No, and actually, well, you know, those...

19:18.010 --> 19:20.437
We've done some things to make it look like magic.

19:20.998 --> 19:25.390
They really are two separate bitmaps, two separate images that overlay.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.037
I mean, there are people that look at it, and of course,

19:28.439 --> 19:31.604
view it as a software program that sort of instantly translates.

19:32.446 --> 19:32.946
Not quite.

19:33.587 --> 19:35.310
That's a nice idea, too.

19:35.511 --> 19:37.394
You mentioned Bill Gates a couple of times.

19:37.434 --> 19:40.258
How closely does he work, since this is his baby, apparently?

19:40.278 --> 19:41.941
This is quite apart from Microsoft.

19:42.021 --> 19:46.148
Well, he's a chairman in two companies, Microsoft and Corvus.

19:46.228 --> 19:50.455
He's invested in others, but he's not an officer in any other company but those two.

19:50.575 --> 19:52.899
But this is a privately owned entity, right?

19:53.440 --> 19:55.223
He is actually...

19:55.692 --> 20:18.566
been very important to us to this stage, and I would expect his time in the future to actually increase, because I think we've gotten to the point now where there are opening up to us a lot of very interesting strategic opportunities, and there's some leveraging.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.010
We know how to build an archive.

20:21.070 --> 20:25.176
We know how to catalog in a way that people would like to buy both, but

20:25.510 --> 20:28.014
We actually don't sell it because it's not our business.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.218
I said, you don't sell what now?

20:31.238 --> 20:31.919
Cataloging.

20:33.642 --> 20:35.665
For example, we have an amazing thesaurus.

20:36.586 --> 20:39.069
But this is something you only use internally for your own.

20:39.390 --> 20:39.891
That's right.

20:40.051 --> 20:45.559
And everybody who sees the thesaurus says, we'd like to buy it.

20:45.579 --> 20:47.041
Sure, you want to give the competition?

20:47.081 --> 20:49.645
No, not even competition.

20:50.286 --> 20:51.307
They say, no, no, we're not.

20:51.648 --> 20:52.729
I mean, competition.

20:52.809 --> 20:55.433
And I say, well, I'm not in the thesaurus business.

20:56.206 --> 21:00.511
If I sold it to you, would you like an update in six months because it'll change?

21:00.671 --> 21:01.512
Oh, absolutely.

21:01.612 --> 21:02.914
I said, that's not our business.

21:03.494 --> 21:04.155
We don't do that.

21:04.476 --> 21:06.157
Would you like a hotline?

21:06.178 --> 21:07.879
Would you have tech support?

21:07.900 --> 21:08.941
Yeah, I probably would.

21:09.021 --> 21:09.762
We don't do that.

21:10.042 --> 21:13.806
Where do you see the collection, the archive, going?

21:14.007 --> 21:17.851
Do you have a scheme, a plan, a goal?

21:17.951 --> 21:23.057
Are you just acquiring good, are you like fighter pilots, targets of opportunity, as you say?

21:23.324 --> 21:25.668
You know, you see something really important and you go get it.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.771
Well, I would say it's a mixture of both.

21:29.293 --> 21:38.868
There is a taxonomy that is a plan that is in place that we're basically filling in the holes on.

21:38.929 --> 21:42.574
Yeah, it's a company plan that relates to the collection.

21:42.654 --> 21:44.357
Is that something I could see?

21:44.377 --> 21:45.018
Probably not.

21:45.058 --> 21:45.619
I mean, it's...

21:45.903 --> 21:50.951
Yeah, as far as the math of the archive that Charles has been talking about.

21:50.971 --> 21:52.173
The question begs to be asked.

21:52.193 --> 21:53.255
Yeah, no, I know it does.

21:53.275 --> 21:54.097
I know it does.

21:55.259 --> 22:11.185
But the taxonomy provides the basic framework, and it also is a guide to when we, if we decide that we're getting too many polar bears, or, you know, in the Northwest you get a lot of polar bears, but we have great polar bears, but we probably...

22:11.502 --> 22:15.266
are better flushed out on polar bears than we are on koalas.

22:15.366 --> 22:15.967
I don't know.

22:16.227 --> 22:31.784
And I think that's, I'm also talking in terms of, you know, you've got the Hermitage, and you've got the Bedman Archive, and you've got the Atal Adams, and, you know, various areas that you might be wanting to explore.

22:32.504 --> 22:34.426
Medical, I mean, who knows?

22:34.466 --> 22:35.307
I have no idea.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.268
Well, let me say.

22:36.529 --> 22:37.830
Various disciplines.

22:38.013 --> 22:47.166
The categories we have set, we know where we're stronger and weaker, and within them we know by category where we have and don't have.

22:47.206 --> 22:48.708
So we really have a plan on that.

22:48.988 --> 22:53.234
At the same time, it was sort of interesting.

22:56.339 --> 23:06.653
When Herb and I started talking even before I launched the idea with Bill, I could see that he was treading around this idea of purchasing.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.912
And, you know, the Bettman Archive was not for sale.

23:10.673 --> 23:11.474
I didn't know that, no.

23:11.674 --> 23:12.735
No, it was actually not.

23:12.895 --> 23:26.427
And it was one of the questions that the media came and heard on is, couldn't you have gotten more if you'd gone out and gone into auction and gotten... And he said, he's an interesting guy, by the way.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.089
He is very different from Otto.

23:29.109 --> 23:31.752
Well, the media didn't apparently know how much was paid for it, though.

23:31.772 --> 23:32.372
They still don't.

23:32.853 --> 23:35.175
Yeah, I've ever heard six million for what it was worth.

23:35.195 --> 23:36.876
Well, there have been two numbers.

23:37.227 --> 23:39.531
There's the $6 million that was in Newsweek.

23:39.951 --> 23:41.754
The Wall Street Journal said $25 million.

23:43.137 --> 23:43.998
Pick a number.

23:44.018 --> 23:48.786
And we can neither confirm nor deny anything.

23:48.806 --> 23:58.000
And the number that reportedly was paid for a business that's half or less the size of Bettman at Holt & Deutsch, called Holt & Deutsch, is 12.

23:58.802 --> 23:59.703
It was paid by Getty.

24:00.144 --> 24:01.446
But...

24:02.388 --> 24:06.913
I thought six were low, to tell you the truth.

24:06.933 --> 24:09.816
By the way, it's not only low, it's the wrong number.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.438
I will say that much.

24:11.478 --> 24:14.462
I mean, it would have been crazy to sell it for six.

24:15.363 --> 24:24.413
As one who's attended many, many options, you're right, they could have done a hell of a lot better than six at a public auction.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.066
By the way... But that's irrelevant.

24:26.086 --> 24:26.647
I didn't ask them.

24:26.667 --> 24:27.107
No, I know.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.090
We paid a very fair price.

24:29.331 --> 24:30.172
They're very happy.

24:30.192 --> 24:31.834
Believe it or not, I'm not really overly concerned.

24:31.854 --> 24:32.255
No, I know.

24:32.535 --> 24:32.776
I know.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.241
No, the interesting thing... Because I also believe whatever it was, it was worth it.

24:37.162 --> 24:41.669
I believe that when Bill Gates spent $30 million for the Codex, it was worth it.

24:41.789 --> 24:42.030
Right.

24:42.570 --> 24:45.034
Because the Italians certainly thought it was worth it.

24:45.254 --> 24:48.078
Otherwise, had they had more money, they would have bid more money.

24:48.559 --> 24:49.020
That's life.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.402
That's the way it goes.

24:50.422 --> 24:54.568
You know, it's worth whatever... Two people would like to spend for it.

24:54.937 --> 24:55.378
I'm sorry.

24:55.418 --> 24:56.179
No, that's okay.

24:56.219 --> 25:09.522
The reason I would say that the purchase of Bettman pushed us further in the direction of that sort of material than if we hadn't, we would have pushed.

25:09.863 --> 25:14.431
So there's a little bit of this combination of the plan and the fighter pilot.

25:16.475 --> 25:17.316
We have coveted

25:17.971 --> 25:20.054
doing something in the area of photojournalism.

25:20.174 --> 25:22.857
And we've been talking to photojournalists.

25:22.877 --> 25:24.920
But the Turnley thing... And you know what?

25:24.960 --> 25:27.563
The Turnleys started out as a licensing discussion.

25:28.304 --> 25:33.971
And then we found that they were feeling... David and Peter live in Paris.

25:34.031 --> 25:34.712
They're Americans.

25:34.732 --> 25:35.373
They're twins.

25:36.334 --> 25:39.077
They're... In fact, they were in here yesterday.

25:39.098 --> 25:40.780
They're amazing personalities.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.863
I mean, they're really, really interesting guys.

25:43.884 --> 25:47.488
I mean, and they have...

25:48.548 --> 26:00.962
I don't know what sort of journalists, you know, are basically put their life at stake all the time, more than any, practically any category of profession.

26:01.643 --> 26:13.476
And the Ternleys, they're blonde, they're both striking looking, and they both are very articulate and very passionate, but they were concerned.

26:14.013 --> 26:17.057
about what was going to happen to the 20 years of their output.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.740
So they had a preservation concern.

26:19.501 --> 26:26.751
And they also, the more they shot, the more the business side of it was eating into their time.

26:27.532 --> 26:31.057
And they wanted to be free to do what they do, which is take photographs.

26:31.778 --> 26:41.792
And so we moved from a licensing into a purchase situation, into an acquisition, and it was happiness on both sides.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.164
It's a combination of all these things with you.

26:44.264 --> 26:49.714
It's acquisition, it's outright ownership, it's licensing to use, non-exclusive.

26:50.475 --> 26:57.748
And, of course, with public domain, I think we have 65 different public domain sources.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.415
And I'm amazed.

27:01.655 --> 27:05.282
I would have thought when we started, when I started two and a half years ago,

27:05.718 --> 27:09.984
that people would have said with Library of Congress, wait a minute, I'd go to Library of Congress and get that.

27:10.425 --> 27:11.166
Well, you can do it.

27:11.686 --> 27:15.572
Which was what I did for the cover of my book, you know.

27:15.592 --> 27:22.682
But, you know, the process by which you find things in the Library of Congress is not nearly as easy as this year.

27:22.762 --> 27:27.209
I had to have known where it was and what the column number was, which helped a great deal.

27:27.509 --> 27:33.177
And also the licensing fee from Corvus is going to be, or is,

27:33.562 --> 27:38.507
competitive with the access fees that one pays at the Library of Congress.

27:38.527 --> 27:40.890
I don't know if you remember how much you paid.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.211
$7.50.

27:42.411 --> 27:42.892
Oh, no.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.073
Well, it's a little lower.

27:44.093 --> 27:50.780
As opposed to the $500 the Morgan Library won for the same picture.

27:51.942 --> 27:52.262
Right.

27:53.003 --> 27:54.885
But to come back, there's a definite plan.

27:59.109 --> 28:01.712
We're adding about 40,000 pictures a month now.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.761
We'll go over a million this year.

28:05.843 --> 28:22.599
My guess is that to be comprehensive, relatively comprehensive, it'll probably require our being at the five million level, which will take us, of course, a lot more time.

28:23.420 --> 28:31.868
I think that at a million pictures, you always find something there, and people are increasingly, people are really buying

28:32.202 --> 28:37.589
We had the best revenue month ever in licensing in August.

28:38.230 --> 28:40.914
September's going to be better, I'm told.

28:41.975 --> 28:44.318
And I think it's a byproduct.

28:46.221 --> 28:57.636
Laurie and I were in Perpignan at a photojournalist show called Viseau Pour Le Mange, and I was staying with a family

28:58.780 --> 29:13.363
in town where there's a connection, and the man who is a Catalan, French, but probably Catalan first, French second in that area, wanted to take me to see a medieval hill town called Castelieu.

29:14.105 --> 29:23.640
And we went out in the late afternoon, we went over, we walked up into an incredible place, had a drink, and then we were back at his house, and he said, do you have any pictures?

29:24.498 --> 29:26.380
He said, of that town.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.083
He asked me, because he knew what business we were in.

29:29.183 --> 29:30.003
I said, I don't know.

29:30.444 --> 29:31.645
So I took my laptop.

29:31.865 --> 29:33.207
I hooked it into his telephone.

29:33.947 --> 29:37.991
I hooked into the network here in Seattle.

29:38.011 --> 29:43.537
I searched, and we were within 45 minutes of being in the town, looking at pictures of Cassidy.

29:43.637 --> 29:44.698
I thought he was going to die.

29:45.379 --> 29:52.986
I mean, he... But then the next story... And then the next story, Laurie and I and other Corpus people were hosted...

29:53.354 --> 30:04.771
by the mayor of Perpignol at a reception that started at 12.30 in the morning in his office, and it was a very classy affair with caviar and salmon and champagne and gifts.

30:04.791 --> 30:08.776
I mean, he was really, he was really being very nice to us.

30:08.796 --> 30:09.117
Very gracious.

30:09.437 --> 30:17.549
We went from, part of it was he wanted to thank us for being there and for supporting this company, the whole show.

30:17.569 --> 30:19.412
We sponsored an award this year.

30:19.993 --> 30:22.416
We moved up into the little Corvus room

30:22.649 --> 30:24.471
where we had a couple of computer terminals.

30:25.232 --> 30:29.537
And we did a search on Perpignol, and one of the pictures in it was of his office.

30:29.557 --> 30:29.878
Jeez.

30:30.619 --> 30:31.560
Okay, Town Hall.

30:31.580 --> 30:34.483
He said, that's where our old meeting... He thought it was a plan.

30:34.924 --> 30:36.325
He thought we'd done that deliberately.

30:36.345 --> 30:37.887
Now, where are the sources coming from?

30:37.907 --> 30:40.230
This is just from stuff that you've acquired.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.734
So every image that comes in, somebody has to catalog it, right?

30:43.754 --> 30:44.675
That's that whole group.

30:44.736 --> 30:45.316
That's what I said.

30:45.336 --> 30:47.619
The largest devotion of people we have is in that group.

30:47.639 --> 30:48.520
Almost 40 people.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.201
Cataloging.

30:49.241 --> 30:52.605
Now, I have a chapter in my book that's out now that...

30:53.108 --> 30:55.571
I have a chapter on the University of Texas, the HRC.

30:55.591 --> 31:02.701
You know, 30% of the stuff, only 30% of the stuff that they've acquired in the last 30 years is cataloged at this particular point.

31:03.342 --> 31:11.153
You know, they've got only 70 people working on it, but it's going to take 20 years, 15 years to catalog everything.

31:11.193 --> 31:16.500
How do you possibly have the resources to do a million pieces of paper?

31:17.003 --> 31:20.066
We'll do... Of course, this is scholarly cataloging, too.

31:20.086 --> 31:25.070
You just have to put the name of... I don't think it's as extensive as it is.

31:25.110 --> 31:32.116
We have very few... We're doing serious... For example, every keyword has a relevancy.

31:32.196 --> 31:34.778
It's the software that makes this whole thing possible, isn't it?

31:34.798 --> 31:35.079
Totally.

31:35.099 --> 31:36.120
It's impossible without it.

31:36.580 --> 31:42.085
As a matter of fact, the way to think about cataloging is we don't add data to an image.

31:42.866 --> 31:45.728
We insert an image, a picture, into data.

31:45.944 --> 31:47.006
Let me illustrate that.

31:48.107 --> 31:58.203
Let's suppose that you find a picture of the Nixon family dog that you want to have in the archive for some reason.

31:59.665 --> 32:05.294
We have a body of pictures about the Nixon and Nixon family, and maybe on the Nixon family dog already.

32:05.975 --> 32:12.846
You can pull that up, and in effect, you can think of it as you can almost attach from that repository

32:13.147 --> 32:18.114
And then you need to reflect who the photographer was when it was taken, what differences there are.

32:18.134 --> 32:22.240
Before I go today, can somebody demonstrate something like this?

32:22.340 --> 32:25.704
At ABA, that was what we were doing, was doing searches into the archives.

32:25.724 --> 32:27.367
This is something I should really see, I think.

32:27.387 --> 32:30.571
That's where Nick and I met, was at the ABA conference.

32:30.591 --> 32:40.605
Nick, if you were to take Corbett's, and you were starting to strip away everything we have here, and you could only be left with one function, it would be cataloged.

32:41.108 --> 32:50.017
Cataloging is the most important thing we do and the software that surrounds that in Corvus.

32:50.418 --> 32:56.764
And this is why it feeds in so beautifully to Microsoft and to what the company does, I guess.

32:56.864 --> 32:57.005
Right.

32:57.025 --> 32:57.545
Yeah, no, it does.

32:57.605 --> 32:59.067
No, absolutely.

32:59.727 --> 33:04.452
So, I'd like to reiterate one other point.

33:05.133 --> 33:09.057
Bill had a vision.

33:09.830 --> 33:15.418
in the late 80s that caused the founding of Corvus.

33:15.438 --> 33:16.420
It was founded in 1989.

33:17.421 --> 33:38.453
And his vision was that just as he and Paul Allen had seen software as an area of great opportunity when they founded Microsoft, they decided, you know, they figured out, maybe in advance of anybody, that the hardware was going to become a commodity and that the real value was going to be software.

33:38.905 --> 33:43.171
in the whole computer industry, which has been borne out to a great extent.

33:43.191 --> 33:48.678
Not that there isn't a lot of paid-for equipment, but it's gotten very commoditized.

33:48.778 --> 33:52.263
There isn't quite the uniqueness that there is in software.

33:52.283 --> 34:00.955
In the 80s, he said, you know, the same thing is going to happen with content, as we call what we have, that is pictures and other forms of information.

34:00.975 --> 34:03.639
So Corbis was founded, and he's guided it.

34:04.900 --> 34:08.305
He spends around six hours a month

34:09.027 --> 34:13.072
in Corvus in one form or another, plus two full days.

34:13.713 --> 34:16.857
It's a mixture of here and in his office.

34:17.657 --> 34:19.219
Which is how far from here?

34:19.340 --> 34:19.820
Ten minutes.

34:21.242 --> 34:22.543
They're in Bellevue, too?

34:22.624 --> 34:33.477
No, they're actually in Redmond, but the street that's right here is 156th, and the Microsoft campus is on 156th, north, ten minutes.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.360
Maybe you can pick a write-up and just take a look at it.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.663
Oh, you should, yeah.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.642
Watch the speed limit signs.

34:40.682 --> 34:42.183
This is legendary.

34:42.283 --> 34:48.249
Our Microsoft visitors in particular, Corvus people going up there, I've never gotten a ticket.

34:48.530 --> 34:51.473
But the Microsoft visitors are coming down here for meetings.

34:51.493 --> 34:52.394
There have been more.

34:52.774 --> 34:56.578
They come in and say, oh, God, sorry, I just got a speeding ticket down here.

34:57.279 --> 35:03.165
But if you follow that north and just keep watching on your right,

35:03.787 --> 35:05.929
and we can give you a little more direction than that.

35:05.949 --> 35:08.051
You'll come right up into the Microsoft Academy.

35:08.071 --> 35:09.192
I'd like to see it, actually.

35:09.292 --> 35:10.173
No, it's huge.

35:10.433 --> 35:11.394
It's quite amazing.

35:11.474 --> 35:11.954
It's huge.

35:11.994 --> 35:13.916
I've seen the photographs and enough of it.

35:14.236 --> 35:14.757
It's nice.

35:15.877 --> 35:18.039
No visit to Seattle would be complete.

35:18.119 --> 35:18.360
Right.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.802
I didn't get into the city, and I'm not likely to.

35:20.862 --> 35:22.203
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

35:22.703 --> 35:32.612
I'd like to call you at some point after I've had a chance to transcribe and say, the book is still three years away from publication.

35:33.098 --> 35:36.343
So this is a first visit I would expect.

35:36.403 --> 35:38.526
Perhaps I might even want to come back at some point.

35:38.906 --> 35:41.230
I'll certainly want to go over your quotes with you.

35:41.891 --> 35:43.553
No surprises with what I do.

35:43.653 --> 35:47.138
I want people to be quoted accurately.

35:48.019 --> 35:50.904
So maybe we can go over that at some point.

35:51.224 --> 35:55.350
It'll be a matter of months, but I'm certain that there will be follow-up questions.

35:55.811 --> 35:58.595
I think it's an important subject.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.380
You met with Curtis.

36:03.153 --> 36:05.716
Curtis's talent is unique.

36:05.736 --> 36:07.358
It's wonderful, and I love Charles.

36:07.378 --> 36:09.480
He's a former antiquarian bookseller.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.963
Charles is amazing.

36:11.983 --> 36:19.571
I mean, I think the strength of any organization are people.

36:21.293 --> 36:28.881
There was a person who, representing, hey, this is my daughter, actually.

36:28.901 --> 36:28.961
Hi.

36:29.081 --> 36:30.382
How are you?

36:30.402 --> 36:30.963
How are you doing?

36:31.283 --> 36:32.365
Good.

36:32.385 --> 36:32.805
You got it?

36:32.903 --> 36:34.425
See ya.

36:34.445 --> 36:38.109
Goodbye.

36:41.173 --> 36:48.162
The people, but let me just ask you a question.

36:48.282 --> 36:50.805
What is there in your background that prepared you for this?

36:51.346 --> 36:54.029
I wonder what brought you up to.

36:54.489 --> 36:55.471
That's a good question.

36:55.611 --> 36:57.974
I was a double E undergraduate, MBA.

36:58.554 --> 36:59.856
Cornell went to work for IBM.

37:01.135 --> 37:04.820
worked there 22 years, left from 12 years ago.

37:04.840 --> 37:10.246
Got recruited out of IBM at a time when it made the least sense for me to leave IBM.

37:10.426 --> 37:11.928
And doing what with IBM?

37:11.948 --> 37:14.051
I was director of quality in my last job.

37:14.131 --> 37:19.798
Before that, I was the product manager for all of the large systems products at the right time.

37:19.878 --> 37:22.521
Today is not the right time.

37:22.641 --> 37:28.088
Which is, I'd like to say, is my wisdom, but a lot of it is luck.

37:29.941 --> 37:31.723
I was in sales and marketing.

37:31.803 --> 37:38.089
I was basically an engineer that got talked into going into sales and had a lot of fun with it.

37:38.809 --> 37:43.073
And since then, I see myself as having been returning to the technology.

37:43.093 --> 37:50.260
When the PC was invented in 1981, or was launched by IBM, my whole life started changing.

37:51.141 --> 37:59.509
I left IBM three years later, and I'm a little bit, relatively speaking, of a computer nerd.

37:59.793 --> 38:03.458
I mean, I really find it pretty.

38:04.299 --> 38:07.323
You better not.

38:07.403 --> 38:08.986
No, I find them fascinating.

38:09.126 --> 38:14.553
I think for the 12 years since I've been out of IBM, I've been working.

38:16.256 --> 38:25.428
The first nine of them were in different forms of images on the desktop.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.614
The first company I went with, we spent a lot of time

38:29.932 --> 38:34.479
strategizing on how to get into an application that we call imaging.

38:34.499 --> 38:39.466
And what Corvus does is really a niche part of that.

38:39.827 --> 38:42.811
I mean, it has a much different sort of a framework.

38:42.831 --> 38:45.275
So I've been working on it.

38:45.295 --> 38:52.565
I'm really passionate about the technology and the use of digital content and how people interact with it.

38:52.886 --> 38:59.095
I was president of a software company in Berkeley called AXS just before coming to Corvus that

38:59.480 --> 39:09.409
in some ways was a competitor of Corvus, except Corvus had nothing in the marketplace, and we were selling stuff.

39:09.429 --> 39:14.934
You know, we, you know, a small company, it's evolved, and it's called Digital Collections, Inc.

39:14.974 --> 39:28.086
today, and it's not doing much of anything, but it was really pioneering in the whole notion that computer technology was good enough to allow you to scan

39:28.471 --> 39:32.798
look at photographs on a computer screen and print a photograph.

39:33.519 --> 39:40.930
And you can today scan, look, print, and I'll give you the print, and I'll give you the original scan, and you can't tell them apart.

39:42.553 --> 39:56.054
And you hold it up and you look at it on the screen, and the only difference is that the photoluminescence, because you're with a CRT, you're coming from behind, is it gives a sound of a glow, which with a Renoir works great.

39:56.134 --> 39:56.875
A certain other

39:57.040 --> 40:01.967
with, you know, illustrated manuscripts doesn't work, I don't think, at all, where they've been gold, you know.

40:02.207 --> 40:02.648
The illuminated.

40:02.728 --> 40:03.809
Oh, the illuminated ones.

40:05.191 --> 40:06.813
Yeah, you know, the stuff, lubrication.

40:06.893 --> 40:16.466
In fact, when IBM... The line coming from on top of... Yeah, when IBM did that Vatican thing, I mean, they're showing these illuminated manuscripts, and... It'll work.

40:17.147 --> 40:17.768
It doesn't work.

40:19.090 --> 40:26.440
Krauss, I don't know if you know the story, but the way that Krauss and Bettman got together is...

40:26.943 --> 40:29.867
I think his name was H. P. Krauss.

40:29.887 --> 40:30.868
Hans P. Krauss.

40:31.108 --> 40:33.831
Hans P. Krauss was a rare book dealer.

40:33.851 --> 40:40.840
Hans P. Krauss is, in my last book, in this new book, he was one of these emigre booksellers.

40:40.860 --> 40:40.980
Right.

40:41.200 --> 40:48.889
He, at the time, was probably the most important bookseller in the world when he died in 1980 or so.

40:48.909 --> 40:51.853
He's a major, major guy, and his daughter, Marianne Krauss.

40:52.458 --> 40:53.600
Now runs H.P.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.021
Krause.

40:54.041 --> 40:54.502
No, I know her.

40:54.802 --> 40:55.163
I know her.

40:55.183 --> 40:57.326
We've... Marianne Krause-Poulter.

40:57.447 --> 40:58.989
Your husband is Roland Polter.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.472
Well, we shook hands.

41:00.532 --> 41:05.240
See, Herb is married to Marianne's sister, who's Bobby.

41:07.083 --> 41:09.447
And so there are five Krause siblings.

41:10.910 --> 41:15.698
Hans-Peter Krause, Jr., I guess, is a junior...

41:16.049 --> 41:18.432
has his own business in Rare Photographs.

41:18.452 --> 41:20.114
It's in the Mark Hotel in New York.

41:20.134 --> 41:20.815
That's right.

41:21.095 --> 41:21.776
H.P.

41:21.796 --> 41:26.141
Crouch is owned by Marianne and her mother, Honey.

41:26.522 --> 41:32.409
And her mother is... And they are so cute.

41:32.429 --> 41:36.133
In fact... I'm interviewing them, by the way, for this new book.

41:36.213 --> 41:36.914
Great.

41:37.415 --> 41:41.680
Because Hans was one of these people who was forced out of Germany by Hitler.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.183
Came here and basically...

41:44.332 --> 41:53.223
I didn't mention I'm having a chapter on the emigres, but maybe 40 or 50 booksellers change the whole flow of books over a 50- or 60-year period to institutions.

41:53.243 --> 41:54.585
It's a very fascinating story.

41:54.865 --> 41:57.268
Have you been in the Crosshair books?

41:57.368 --> 41:58.650
Oh, yes.

41:59.311 --> 42:02.375
Well, you know, the upstairs room was their living room.

42:02.575 --> 42:03.136
They lived there.

42:03.236 --> 42:12.988
And the handshake on the Corvus Purgis abetment was there.

42:13.238 --> 42:18.805
and all of our meetings were there, because we couldn't do it at Bettman, you know, and it was a nice setting.

42:19.426 --> 42:24.512
No, I mean, there's a resonance with this book that makes it quite interesting.

42:24.813 --> 42:26.014
The interconnection.

42:26.034 --> 42:26.295
Oh, yeah.

42:26.375 --> 42:42.435
And part of the reason I thought of that is that being in that floor gives you yet another chance to see some illuminated manuscripts, of which they have a number that are... Well, they have some from Mr. Thomas Phillips' collection, which I wrote about in my book.

42:43.343 --> 42:50.374
This is a business, Laurie, where it's a very nice address in Midtown, New York.

42:51.336 --> 42:55.522
It's a place that probably has one or two visitors a day.

42:56.524 --> 42:59.228
Oh, yeah, and then it's, I think you have to get buzzed in.

42:59.308 --> 43:01.371
I'm not even so sure you can walk in on the street.

43:01.391 --> 43:05.638
They're very nice, okay, and so it isn't, but it's just,

43:06.158 --> 43:07.340
Very understated.

43:07.380 --> 43:08.321
That's right.

43:08.341 --> 43:11.886
It's not the kind of place you go in and expect to pay $20 for a book.

43:11.906 --> 43:14.851
It's the place you go in and spend maybe $10,000 for a book.

43:15.231 --> 43:15.512
Right.

43:15.612 --> 43:16.714
Or, you know, or whatever.

43:16.754 --> 43:21.000
And apparently the catalogs cost $100 a piece.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.602
Right, yeah.

43:22.622 --> 43:30.294
Apparently there are 300 or 400 or 500 real serious collectors of these things around the world.

43:30.394 --> 43:31.896
So they have a really enough...

43:32.281 --> 43:33.863
They have a very defined customer.

43:33.883 --> 43:39.469
Yeah, but it's also institutions like the Morgan Library and the Huntington and the Getty that buy them.

43:39.489 --> 43:40.010
Right.

43:40.030 --> 43:48.439
And, in fact, they'll get certain things that they'll offer directly to these institutions, and they'll have funds immediately available to acquire them.

43:48.479 --> 43:49.460
I think it also helps.

43:49.881 --> 43:58.570
You mentioned this outfit that you were with in Berkeley and why they haven't really gone as far as you obviously have.

43:58.871 --> 44:01.073
I think the means to acquire this material

44:01.441 --> 44:02.503
is your plus.

44:02.803 --> 44:08.211
You know, the fact that you are a startup company, you don't have to report whether or not you're black or red.

44:08.251 --> 44:12.217
It's not the, you know, and I'm not asking the question I asked Laurie earlier.

44:12.237 --> 44:14.240
I mean, the question takes to be asked.

44:14.260 --> 44:18.727
I'm sure at some point you want this, you expect this to be a profitable operation.

44:18.747 --> 44:24.896
But in the meantime, you have to have capital to go out and be able to go out and buy it.

44:25.597 --> 44:28.782
Yeah, this is not an easy business to get started.

44:29.487 --> 44:42.265
And it's one that when, shortly after I started, Bill and I agreed that before we really could become viable in licensing, we needed a million images.

44:42.285 --> 44:46.490
And we also both agreed that we didn't know why it was a million, but we just sort of... It sounded good.

44:46.510 --> 44:47.171
It sounded good.

44:49.374 --> 44:50.696
I'm glad we didn't say a billion.

44:51.798 --> 44:57.165
You know, it felt... You consider a major collection of universities who I agree with in books.

44:57.685 --> 44:58.045
Right.

44:58.166 --> 44:59.487
It's a number.

44:59.787 --> 45:01.389
And by the way, it's proving out.

45:01.950 --> 45:14.945
I mean, it actually, when we started training at Simon & Schuster to give them direct access to the archive, we had a woman who said, I've been going crazy trying to find pictures of E. coli of a project.

45:15.846 --> 45:18.569
And if I'd been there, I would have rolled my eyes.

45:18.589 --> 45:22.634
I would have said, you know, do we have E. coli?

45:22.654 --> 45:23.355
We had 10.

45:23.707 --> 45:24.047
Sure.

45:24.067 --> 45:25.469
Great pictures of people.

45:25.609 --> 45:25.990
Of course.

45:26.010 --> 45:32.639
You never would have been able to do that show that you did with the guy at Sara's office unless you had a million images.

45:33.380 --> 45:37.485
I've never been frustrated doing research at Harvard University.

45:37.645 --> 45:37.905
Why?

45:37.945 --> 45:39.988
They have 13.5 million books.

45:40.769 --> 45:41.009
Never.

45:41.150 --> 45:44.894
I mean, I've looked for the most obscure, off-the-wall, crazy thing.

45:45.715 --> 45:47.578
I've always been able to find it.

45:47.598 --> 45:48.900
A certain mass of materials.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.001
A certain mass of materials.

45:50.251 --> 45:55.218
In my book, I'm sorry, but I've been... Okay, I'm sorry.

45:55.238 --> 45:57.081
There are 16 million pictures at Bettman.

45:58.263 --> 46:05.994
We estimate today, we may find out differently, that we'll put 200,000 to 300,000 of them in the digital collection.

46:06.695 --> 46:07.957
So we'll make the selection.

46:08.598 --> 46:11.982
When we have an agreement with the Hermitage in St.

46:12.002 --> 46:19.313
Petersburg, and I believe they claim 4 million works of art, the numbers that we bring into the Corbus Collection will probably be in the thousands.

46:20.153 --> 46:25.338
And so one of the important roles here... Will you catalog everything, though?

46:25.359 --> 46:27.281
No, we'll catalog those that we put in.

46:28.442 --> 46:32.927
But what if there's a request for something that's... Well, we have relationships.

46:32.947 --> 46:33.928
We've done that already.

46:34.048 --> 46:39.834
Yeah, but I mean, you might decide that there's something that you want that you chose not to digitize and put in the collection.

46:40.515 --> 46:48.523
Well, we won't catalog it because even though the cataloging has gotten pretty inexpensive for us...

46:49.837 --> 46:53.500
36 people catalog 40,000 items a month.

46:54.541 --> 47:05.511
And so if you decided that you wanted to do 400, another 360,000 without the scan, the cost becomes pretty prohibitive.

47:05.671 --> 47:09.455
I don't know, have you been at the new BNF in Paris?

47:10.275 --> 47:12.077
No, that's... I was there Monday night.

47:12.838 --> 47:14.399
It's on my schedule.

47:14.419 --> 47:18.983
I went totally... There's a person that we've been working with...

47:19.199 --> 47:21.022
This is amazing, Laurie.

47:21.042 --> 47:29.095
I flew back through Paris just because it was a nonstop flight from Paris to San Francisco to get home faster, so I went back to Paris.

47:29.115 --> 47:32.079
And Gilles and I did two things.

47:32.159 --> 47:40.853
We went to, this is our compatriot, our distributor in France, we went over to BNF, and the French government

47:41.407 --> 47:44.790
is just completing a new library, a new national library.

47:44.810 --> 47:48.674
Oh, it's going to be in the concluding library in my opening chapter in my book.

47:49.094 --> 47:51.537
It's the cost to build it was a billion dollars.

47:51.557 --> 47:52.758
A little more, actually.

47:52.778 --> 47:52.898
Okay.

47:52.918 --> 47:54.299
Well, they don't talk about it.

47:54.319 --> 48:08.152
And they don't even, there's no discussion of operating it, meaning that they not even, nobody, but the thing, it has a courtyard that has, that they brought in and planted a 75-foot tall tree.

48:08.853 --> 48:08.933
Wow.

48:09.453 --> 48:11.455
It is magnificent.

48:12.316 --> 48:14.177
Four open books facing each other.

48:14.317 --> 48:14.978
Oh, wow.

48:14.998 --> 48:15.979
Four towers.

48:16.179 --> 48:18.821
Four towers, but they're each an open book.

48:19.442 --> 48:20.763
Oh, very cool.

48:21.083 --> 48:34.375
And they also have a system that, as you were talking about, Harvard's not dissimilar, where there is a way to order up and have delivered books for many.

48:34.876 --> 48:35.336
I don't know.

48:35.376 --> 48:36.437
How many books do they have?

48:36.617 --> 48:37.198
Oh, it's

48:39.018 --> 48:40.200
I don't know.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.081
I'd be guessing.

48:41.121 --> 48:42.202
It's got to be 20 million.

48:42.563 --> 48:45.767
The Library of Congress is the largest, I guess, in the world.

48:45.787 --> 48:49.132
And the New York Public Library is the largest private in the world.

48:49.152 --> 48:51.935
Harvard is the largest university in the world.

48:51.955 --> 48:58.444
Well, BNF, I can't imagine in this country our building a building

48:59.032 --> 49:01.554
Or at least, if they did it, they wouldn't talk about it.

49:01.574 --> 49:03.516
For the Library of Congress, it's a billion dollars.

49:03.576 --> 49:05.358
Would we spend a billion dollars on that?

49:05.478 --> 49:07.700
Well, this was a monument.

49:07.720 --> 49:12.585
I mean, this was a political scandal, and not a scandal, cause I left, I guess, wasn't it.

49:12.605 --> 49:12.865
Right.

49:12.925 --> 49:14.066
It's very cool.

49:14.327 --> 49:17.069
It's on the... I can't wait to go see it.

49:17.089 --> 49:21.734
It's on the... And the British Library is doing the same sort of thing.

49:22.214 --> 49:26.018
This, you know, I did an interview with Paul Leclerc, New York Public Library, a couple weeks ago.

49:26.487 --> 49:28.889
He said, you know, you worry about libraries of the future.

49:28.909 --> 49:34.735
He said, no time in history has more money been spent than it's being spent right now for brand new libraries.

49:34.755 --> 49:42.342
He mentioned the Paris one, the new British library, which is scheduled to open, the San Francisco one I just visited two days ago, brand new one in Germany.

49:42.982 --> 49:49.108
All over the world are these multi, multi-million dollar facilities going up for libraries.

49:49.328 --> 49:50.509
Libraries aren't going to disappear.

49:50.529 --> 49:55.954
By the way, you probably need no introduction or need no contact

49:56.373 --> 50:06.946
at BNF, but the man who's our associate there, or a friend there, his name is Roland Scher, and I'll get you the information.

50:06.986 --> 50:14.255
And he is sort of at the second level below, you know, one level below the top.

50:14.515 --> 50:15.857
So is the library actually open?

50:16.438 --> 50:17.339
Oh, yeah.

50:17.539 --> 50:18.921
Well, no.

50:18.941 --> 50:20.302
The offices are in.

50:20.983 --> 50:22.465
The public can't come in yet.

50:22.725 --> 50:24.928
They actually have, there's a public

50:25.415 --> 50:29.399
And then there's the, what do you call it?

50:29.439 --> 50:34.464
They sort of have two areas of the library.

50:34.484 --> 50:43.874
Oh, there's the Bibliote Nationale, which is the... No, no, all within the library, there are two... You enter, by the way... Oh, I've not been there yet.

50:43.934 --> 50:47.678
The ceilings in this place are 42 feet high.

50:48.699 --> 50:48.779
Wow.

50:48.799 --> 50:50.000
And the architect made them.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.464
That's exactly the height in the old library, which they're keeping.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.541
And that's pretty amazing itself.

50:55.802 --> 50:57.183
You mean the bibliosegments, you know?

50:57.283 --> 50:57.583
Yeah.

50:57.603 --> 50:59.445
They're not moving it over there.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.527
They're going to be operating both of them.

51:01.547 --> 51:02.007
Really?

51:02.027 --> 51:02.968
Oh, yeah, that's right.

51:03.008 --> 51:04.790
In the old reading rooms.

51:05.210 --> 51:07.152
Listen, I'm cutting into his time.

51:07.212 --> 51:09.634
I know he's supposed to leave it for us.

51:10.054 --> 51:12.536
Is there any track that we haven't gone down that you would like to?

51:12.656 --> 51:19.462
I'd just like to keep open the opportunity to call you and ask you any other questions that might develop.

51:19.482 --> 51:21.064
And you've got to make sure you're going to show him.

51:22.185 --> 51:23.586
I don't actually have.

51:24.376 --> 51:45.017
One of the things we're going to do that's really intriguing is we're going to create an offering for the educational community that could and I think will become a resource for academic libraries as sort of an extension.

51:45.778 --> 51:51.184
So, you know, Corvus will be more than a million pictures.

51:51.825 --> 51:53.286
We've shown this

51:54.768 --> 52:03.416
product we use for accessing the archive called CODI to several librarians, academic libraries, Georgetown is one of them.

52:03.777 --> 52:10.703
The potential they see for it within the educational community is incredible because of, again, the complementary aspect.

52:10.723 --> 52:14.407
I mentioned the E. coli virus is just one example.

52:14.907 --> 52:18.891
If you need something for your class, you're giving a lecture on, you know, whatever.

52:18.951 --> 52:19.091
Right.

52:19.992 --> 52:23.155
And all you have to do with that community

52:23.894 --> 52:28.081
is mention that you've got a million pictures, and they start giving you ways they'd use it.

52:29.083 --> 52:33.630
Obviously, our history, they have so many.

52:34.111 --> 52:40.342
And it's our intention, there are three markets that we're focusing on.

52:40.382 --> 52:49.497
One is one we call professional licensing, and that's probably the smallest market of the three, but it's the one that we're

52:50.354 --> 52:53.678
sort of cutting our teeth on in terms of making images available.

52:53.698 --> 52:59.685
These are publishers that, you know, magazines and books, Simon & Schuster and Elijah, that's the market.

52:59.705 --> 53:17.465
The second one is an educational market in which access to the archive and a different form of it than you do for professional licensing is one part, and we're going to be doing, Curtis's group is going to be doing some authoring for that community, for the educational community.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.247
And then the third one is the consumer

53:19.767 --> 53:25.835
You've done four titles so far, but that's the one most visible to the public, isn't it?

53:25.855 --> 53:33.585
Right, but when I say consumer, I'm not thinking of consumer in terms of a CD-ROM.

53:34.146 --> 53:46.703
I'm thinking of the consumer who all of a sudden wakes up and has a very high-capacity connection to an appliance that's in their living room that isn't a TV set, it isn't a computer, but is

53:47.223 --> 53:49.266
is a combination of those two.

53:49.286 --> 53:50.627
It has kind of the benefits of both.

53:50.647 --> 53:58.718
I mean, it might have a price like a TV set, but have a capacity like... So this is something that's coming.

53:58.898 --> 53:59.559
Yeah, it's coming.

53:59.619 --> 54:03.464
And by the way, that's sort of the sequence we're going after it.

54:03.484 --> 54:06.888
And when you say, well, what would the consumer want to do?

54:07.009 --> 54:12.015
Well, it could be...

54:12.417 --> 54:14.519
the high school student doing a paper.

54:14.539 --> 54:25.651
You know, I mentioned my daughter getting Winston Churchill's picture off, you know, for her paper, a 13-year-old kid, and was the head of Microsoft, and I think it said Microsoft, it didn't say Corvus, maybe it's Corvus.

54:25.671 --> 54:27.453
She probably pulled it off of a card, I don't know.

54:27.473 --> 54:31.257
Yeah, I think so, yeah, something she found and printed it up, a bit of me on the paper.

54:31.277 --> 54:33.739
Microsoft is actually a major buyer of images.

54:33.759 --> 54:39.285
They buy from a lot of the stock photo agencies, as well as from Corvus for their products.

54:39.704 --> 54:42.527
It could have been a credit line.

54:44.328 --> 54:56.319
Well, anyway, I really see the electronic, and to go back to the original point, as being very complementary to other forms of information.

54:56.880 --> 55:05.548
You know, new forms of information have intended to replace old ones, at least in the recent number of years.

55:06.729 --> 55:09.171
So I think that if you could

55:10.113 --> 55:24.850
could complement whether it be learning or entertainment or a business-related use with pictures and sounds and video as a supplement to the other forms of printed material.

55:24.910 --> 55:29.635
I mean, then I think you really... Learning happens a lot more easily.

55:29.655 --> 55:37.504
Yeah, there were a lot of areas I covered with Charles and Curtis, so there's no reason to replicate it at this point.

55:37.754 --> 55:42.398
I feel like I'm...
