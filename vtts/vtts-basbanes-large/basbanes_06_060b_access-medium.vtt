00:03.305 --> 00:04.807
George Juggins.

00:04.827 --> 00:06.009
A man into a woman.

00:06.029 --> 00:09.514
And then we had a fascinating situation one time.

00:09.614 --> 00:16.203
A publisher back east came out here to meet some of his authors, and one turned out to be a transvestite.

00:17.045 --> 00:21.351
And he spent an evening in the home, and he told me he found it so fascinating.

00:21.371 --> 00:23.213
He said, well, you like aliens and all that.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.515
Would you like to?

00:24.535 --> 00:26.558
So wife and I said, well, you know, why not?

00:26.718 --> 00:32.046
So the transvestite was to come see us on a Wednesday evening.

00:32.431 --> 00:44.709
And on Monday, I was out somewhere socializing, and we all had little name badges, and this man about as near to me as you are, he kind of looked at mine, and he began laughing, and I said, do we know each other or something?

00:44.729 --> 00:46.431
And he says, I'm Alice.

00:46.451 --> 00:50.117
Well, this was the transvestite that we were going to see on Wednesday.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.703
He was a man in charge of 200 people in the business world.

00:55.364 --> 00:58.389
Well, as a man, I found him as dull as dishwater.

00:58.449 --> 01:01.273
I thought, oh, God, what a wasted evening this is going to be.

01:01.608 --> 01:04.271
but when he came as a woman, he was fascinating.

01:05.393 --> 01:28.600
What my wife and I found even more fascinating was his wife, that he had a perfectly female woman, and she explained to us, she said, well, when we met in England and fell in love, I had no idea about this hankering of his to be a woman, and we were going to be married, and I met his mother, and she said, well, my dear, before you go too far with this, I think you should meet my son's sister.

01:29.862 --> 01:31.564
She hadn't heard anything about a sister.

01:32.101 --> 01:41.403
So she goes to the door one night to meet this sister, and here stands, obviously, the man she's in love with, but in a dress and lipstick and everything.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.448
What's this, you know?

01:43.468 --> 01:47.899
Well, at first she was totally repulsed, you know, get out of my life, I never want to see you.

01:48.824 --> 01:53.971
But after about three days' rumination, she thought, well, gee, you know, I really love that guy.

01:53.991 --> 01:57.977
If that's what it takes to make him happy, I'll make a better woman out of him.

01:58.438 --> 02:04.326
So she taught him how to cross his legs and perfume and the whole schmear.

02:05.368 --> 02:14.161
And here he came, sitting over there, and at one point he dropped his purse, and I was kind of halfway out of my chair to retrieve it.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.743
You know, should I or shouldn't I?

02:15.959 --> 02:20.945
Oh, sure, you know, I was hoping that you would forget or something.

02:21.025 --> 02:25.069
As a woman, he was a fascinating conversationalist.

02:25.089 --> 02:26.571
Must have been very happy now.

02:26.591 --> 02:27.652
Isn't it?

02:27.672 --> 02:34.440
Do you think a lot of the books or magazines or newspapers, you said there are 300,000 items altogether, 50,000 books?

02:34.540 --> 02:38.445
125,000 stills, and there are magazines.

02:38.465 --> 02:39.486
The magazines, I've never counted.

02:39.506 --> 02:41.288
It's easier to say I'm missing three.

02:42.009 --> 02:44.792
Well, I bet you have there in the thousands, certainly.

02:45.573 --> 02:45.713
Mm-hmm.

02:46.250 --> 02:51.901
Do you think that if you weren't collecting them, that they would go to the dump, so to speak?

02:51.921 --> 02:55.307
Do you think that you're preserving things that otherwise would be lost?

02:56.910 --> 03:00.337
Well, no, nothing would.

03:00.357 --> 03:02.942
There are other great collectors.

03:03.302 --> 03:09.574
There's one chap who may have about as many books as I do, or somebody as many as magazines.

03:10.010 --> 03:30.282
or somebody may have as good or even better art collection, but nobody, you know, is all-inclusive, like I am, I say, even collecting the vanity books that you can't give away, nor be the greatest heyday for other collectors, if they could only get their hands on what I have, it would increase other collections.

03:30.302 --> 03:37.333
Unfortunately, these other collectors don't seem to have the same vision that I do, they don't seem to much care what happens to their

03:38.005 --> 03:39.247
collection after they've gone.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.949
I say, the wife will sell it.

03:40.969 --> 03:42.912
You know, but they will only increase.

03:43.814 --> 03:50.283
There's certainly a number of collections in the world I think will just go on growing, even if they're all broken up and sold.

03:50.484 --> 03:54.430
Certain universities will probably bid and get portions of them.

03:54.450 --> 04:01.240
And if I get this two million bucks while I'm still around, I'll probably buy parts of other collections.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.848
Because when I empty out all of the movie material, that's going to leave kind of a void in the house.

04:07.604 --> 04:10.730
Nature, I have horror vacuum, I have to fill it up.

04:12.994 --> 04:14.136
That's great.

04:14.156 --> 04:17.042
I think, Connie, do you have anything you'd like to ask?

04:17.162 --> 04:18.604
I just think his vision is wonderful.

04:18.624 --> 04:25.377
I hope one day when I'm in Germany, I'll be able to see your things on display and remember having met you and enjoyed this so much.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.112
It's been a nice time.

04:27.132 --> 04:28.033
Thanks for taking the time.

04:28.053 --> 04:28.614
Thank you so much.

04:28.634 --> 04:30.416
I'm sorry we got you on a busy day.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.219
It looks like you had a whole morning.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.081
Ain't no such thing as a non-busy day.

04:34.862 --> 04:37.025
I'd just like to take a few more shots in the world.

04:37.546 --> 04:38.267
All you like, all you like.

04:38.327 --> 04:46.739
It's funny when I listen to myself talk, you know, I know how to talk grammatically, but it's kind of a relief to me to say, ain't no such thing or something like that.

04:46.859 --> 04:55.110
When I'm writing all the time, it's perfectly grammatical and correct and so on, but my assistant and I kind of laugh about it now and then, how you think we were...

04:55.478 --> 05:02.566
couple of nincompoops or something that didn't know the English language, the way we slang around here.

05:03.027 --> 05:04.569
Do you have any film scripts and stuff?

05:04.589 --> 05:06.331
Do you collect manuscript material?

05:06.351 --> 05:09.114
I have about 500 film scripts.

05:09.294 --> 05:16.563
I have original manuscripts by Ray Bradbury and A. E. Van Vogt and all kind of important personalities, yes.

05:16.583 --> 05:20.828
So are these things you purchase or that you're given?

05:21.297 --> 05:31.672
Most, maybe movie scripts I've purchased, but the manuscripts, being an agent for 40 years, many of them I've represented, A.E.

05:31.692 --> 05:46.393
Van Vogt for 40 years, so I have all of his important manuscripts, and I started out Ray Bradbury in 1938, so he's given me a lot of his scripts as

05:46.694 --> 05:52.984
Musing little story when Ray was a teenager and wanted to take a girl out for a date because they'd done a dollar.

05:53.425 --> 06:00.476
Twenty-one cents for a first-run movie and nickel for a streetcar ride and five cents for popcorn.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.421
So I was always good a book for a book.

06:03.781 --> 06:04.643
He would bring me a book.

06:04.723 --> 06:06.205
I'd give him a dollar and he'd have his date.

06:07.147 --> 06:12.415
One night in 1933, apparently he had a real heavy date coming up because he wanted two dollars.

06:13.171 --> 06:21.120
So he brought me a copy of the book King Kong, theoretically written by the great mystery author of the day in England named Edgar Wallace.

06:21.660 --> 06:23.622
He said, look, it's been signed by Edgar Wallace.

06:23.642 --> 06:25.224
That ought to be worth an extra dollar.

06:25.985 --> 06:33.693
Well, I was young and naive, and I didn't stop to question how did this kid in high school get the autograph of a man 6,000 miles away in London?

06:33.773 --> 06:35.075
I gave him his extra dollar.

06:36.296 --> 06:42.823
Twenty-five years later, when I was living in a smaller home, just 13 rooms, I'd accumulated so many friends that when I had a

06:43.124 --> 06:53.862
A birthday, we could only pack about 65 people into the house at once, so I had to have five birthdays, Friday night, Saturday matinee, Saturday night, Sunday matinee, and Sunday night.

06:53.963 --> 07:01.796
Well, Ray Bradbury came Sunday night, and he attracts fans around him like iron filings to a magnet.

07:02.237 --> 07:06.364
Well, his eye lit upon that book that he had sold all those years ago.

07:06.766 --> 07:12.192
And he gingerly picked it up and he said, oh, for you, I have a terrible confession.

07:12.212 --> 07:13.814
I wrote that Edgar Wallace.

07:14.876 --> 07:17.819
I said, you dirty dog, give me back my dollar.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.244
So he gave me back the dollar.

07:22.264 --> 07:26.670
Well, I thought about two or three days, and I figured he probably regretted he ever sold me that.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.392
He would like to have a copy of the book.

07:28.412 --> 07:33.718
It's kind of an expensive collector's item now, but I finally found one through the mail.

07:34.306 --> 07:42.819
So I sent it to him over by red arrow so it would be presented at the door and inside I inscribed it to Ray Bradbury from the real Edgar Wallace.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.803
That's nice.

07:45.823 --> 07:54.596
The night before he was married he stood in front of an incinerator burned to two million words of Bradbury manuscripts that he was dissatisfied with.

07:54.676 --> 07:56.158
He has seen what has happened to H.P.

07:56.178 --> 08:03.469
Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard that well-meaning people have taken every little laundry list and turned it into a novel and he's

08:03.820 --> 08:19.638
very particular about the good opinion of posterity, not interested in any money he might make out of something inferior, and he thought if he died of ecstasy on his wedding night, he didn't want well-meaning friends to take all this stuff and publish it, so he burned it.

08:19.658 --> 08:23.102
He became his own Fahrenheit 451 fireman.

08:23.242 --> 08:25.024
Is that—I've never heard that story.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.508
That's—has that been— I don't know.

08:28.728 --> 08:29.249
Is that known?

08:30.190 --> 08:31.452
No, I wouldn't say it's well known.

08:31.852 --> 08:33.574
And how long ago was this?

08:33.706 --> 08:36.310
Oh, jeez, when did Greg get married?

08:39.194 --> 08:41.838
Let's see.

08:41.858 --> 08:42.639
Let's see.

08:42.659 --> 08:45.924
1939, we went to the First World, sometime in the 40s.

08:46.545 --> 08:47.887
I guess it was early 40s.

08:48.147 --> 08:50.871
So you knew him when he was a kid?

08:51.272 --> 08:52.374
Sure, yeah.

08:52.394 --> 08:55.638
And it was just by the coincidence of being a neighbor or something?

08:56.099 --> 08:57.761
No, we had a science fiction club.

08:57.802 --> 09:02.869
I was at the first meeting of that club in 1935 and over 1500.

09:03.558 --> 09:10.565
meetings of it and an ebullient youth named Ray Bradbury.

09:10.585 --> 09:19.795
It's a wonder he survived because he was so noisy and boisterous and rambunctious we were all ready to strangle him.

09:22.258 --> 09:24.200
But he turned out to be greater than us all.

09:26.382 --> 09:31.708
He started coming around the club and we had a little amateur magazine that was mimeographed and I say I had published his

09:32.296 --> 09:33.437
first story in 1938.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.522
Do you think you'd like to have those two million words back?

09:38.623 --> 09:39.044
Yes.

09:39.785 --> 09:47.934
I have seen him do as many as seven rewrites on a story, and frankly, I preferred some of the earlier versions.

09:48.014 --> 09:59.147
I remember one in particular, starts a man is in bed, he hears some kind of a noise in the house, and he spends three or four pages leisurely getting down to the basement to find out what's going on.

09:59.566 --> 10:03.792
In version number seven, the man hears the noise, pow, he's right down there in the basement.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.138
We eliminate everything that's going on in between.

10:07.238 --> 10:14.489
Race is a kind of writer who feels that he overwrites, and then he has to pair and pair and go on.

10:14.549 --> 10:17.453
And I'm probably a kind of a writer who underwrites.

10:17.573 --> 10:23.903
I get all the idea down, then I go back and add a few adjectives and adverbs and sentences and paragraphs and so on.

10:24.895 --> 10:27.359
But I didn't add anything to the one-letter story.

10:27.379 --> 10:28.701
That was perfect.

10:28.741 --> 10:30.784
Did you in fact copyright that?

10:30.804 --> 10:31.365
Oh, sure.

10:31.405 --> 10:31.986
Copyrighted?

10:32.046 --> 10:33.068
Yeah, yeah.

10:33.088 --> 10:36.754
But I was kidding about copywriting the other letters of the alphabet.

10:36.774 --> 10:40.239
But it has been just going for the ninth time in Taiwan.

10:40.259 --> 10:42.563
It's been published.

10:42.603 --> 10:43.485
That's something.

10:43.505 --> 10:44.506
Did you get royalties on it?

10:45.247 --> 10:46.610
No.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.833
I got 500 bucks the first time around.

10:48.953 --> 10:49.454
That's great.

10:49.494 --> 10:51.257
Having it published five times.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.715
Well, I don't think we should take up any more of this gentleman's time.

10:55.158 --> 10:57.636
I would like to... You had a couple of things that give some...
