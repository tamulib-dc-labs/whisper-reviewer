00:03.068 --> 00:05.912
This is the backup paper card.

00:06.112 --> 00:08.615
This is Bill Rees.

00:08.916 --> 00:10.297
Is that Siebert sale made for you?

00:10.578 --> 00:15.825
I mean, is this something that... Well, it's made for me in the sense that it's happening.

00:15.885 --> 00:21.592
It's not made for me in the sense that I would have loved to have bought the books before they went to auction.

00:22.774 --> 00:31.405
I mean, I knew Siebert very well, and I sold him a lot of, I mean, most of the expensive things he bought in the last decade came from me.

00:31.621 --> 00:33.243
So you had a sense of the collection then?

00:33.563 --> 00:35.765
Oh, I had a very good sense of the collection.

00:36.405 --> 00:52.921
I'll show you what Sievert, Sievert, you know, Sievert was not the recluse that he's been painted as.

00:53.461 --> 00:59.687
He was really, I think the real reason why

01:00.140 --> 01:03.265
people in the book world felt that way.

01:03.285 --> 01:07.231
It was really, in many ways, his collecting had slowed down terrifically.

01:07.631 --> 01:13.560
I think partially for financial reasons, a lot of financial reasons.

01:13.881 --> 01:16.745
You know, he had limited income in his retirement.

01:17.767 --> 01:19.409
Book prices had gotten a lot higher.

01:20.170 --> 01:27.902
And like a lot of collectors who've been in the field for a very long time, he had a hard time coping with the fact that books that he paid

01:28.827 --> 01:32.954
Ten bucks were going for a thousand.

01:33.374 --> 01:36.560
So, all those things had slowed him down.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.965
But his real interest was linguistics in the latter part of his life.

01:39.985 --> 01:44.793
He was very involved in Indian history in Maine.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.177
The dictionary and something like that.

01:47.197 --> 01:48.920
I have both of these in general.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.022
I don't know if you have this.

01:50.042 --> 01:55.611
This is the obit that Ives Goddard, who's the head linguist at the Smithsonian.

01:56.030 --> 01:59.015
did for Frank in Anthropology Journal.

01:59.696 --> 02:00.778
Can I get a copy?

02:00.798 --> 02:01.880
They didn't have that.

02:02.001 --> 02:03.303
And it's really, I mean, I think.

02:04.224 --> 02:04.685
Bill?

02:04.705 --> 02:05.046
Yes?

02:05.326 --> 02:08.372
John Clare is about to alarm.

02:08.392 --> 02:10.536
Where were we?

02:10.576 --> 02:12.699
Well, here's a piece of the Banker Daily News.

02:12.719 --> 02:14.763
They had a huge takeout on Seabird.

02:14.863 --> 02:18.730
It's almost humble in part because, well, anyway, spent the last 30 years of his life

02:19.925 --> 02:27.157
I guess they say he was meticulous in his collecting, but he was, I guess, rather disheveled in his... Well, he was certainly, yeah, he was very disheveled.

02:27.177 --> 02:34.389
He took the looking like a bad man in the latter part of his life, but... But they said nobody really knew about the collection in this piece, and that's really not the case.

02:34.469 --> 02:35.751
Yeah, that's not the case at all.

02:35.812 --> 02:39.257
I mean, various people have said, well, nobody knew about the collection.

02:39.317 --> 02:45.628
I think it was really more an issue that, in the book world, Frank outlived his generation.

02:45.963 --> 02:57.739
All of the dealers, when he was an active collector, as Bailey Bishop said in the introduction of the First Cadillac, he bought very widely, bought from kind of the whole spectrum of people who were dealing in this stuff.

02:57.759 --> 03:06.452
He was a very well-known figure in the book world.

03:07.293 --> 03:14.603
And as you'll see, Ives talks a lot more about his personal life than other people do.

03:15.342 --> 03:22.368
He went through this marriage that didn't last very long, and at the end of it, he really had something of a breakdown.

03:22.408 --> 03:24.530
I mean, he moved to Philadelphia.

03:24.550 --> 03:29.134
He moved into kind of a seedy hotel where he basically lived for four years.

03:29.314 --> 03:41.824
And he quit medical work, although in his later years, he was involved with the hospitals up there, because when I talked to him, he'd tell me that he'd been at the hospital doing volunteer work and stuff like that.

03:43.025 --> 03:44.927
And then he moved up to Old Town, Maine.

03:45.498 --> 03:51.887
So the point when, and that put financial constraints on him because of child support and alimony things.

03:52.769 --> 03:59.579
So the point in the 60s when all that happened also corresponded when prices were really taking off.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.848
So he was not that active as a book buyer, kind of from the Streeter sale on.

04:07.150 --> 04:09.253
He only bought five things at the Streeter sale.

04:09.273 --> 04:12.077
I mean, it's a place where you would have thought he would have been very active.

04:12.097 --> 04:13.880
And in fact, he bought some great books there.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.302
I mean, one of the greatest books

04:15.755 --> 04:30.515
In part two of the sale, Lederer's Virginia book, which is a lot of 553, is the most expensive thing you bought at the street or sale, and it's going to be one of the best books in part two.

04:31.416 --> 04:43.753
But all those people who dealt with it, you know, the Eberstotz, Decker, Roland Tree, Stevens, you know, the whole Mike Walsh of Good Speeds, Good Speeds itself,

04:44.915 --> 04:57.071
disappeared over the next period of time, and basically the people he was really in touch with were Bailey Bishop, who had known him from when Bailey had gone to work at Good Speeds, which was probably the biggest single supplier to him.

04:58.152 --> 05:02.618
Me, because I knew about him by reputation and got in touch with him.

05:02.658 --> 05:04.220
So you found him?

05:04.380 --> 05:10.348
Yeah, and I developed a friendship with him, and Clarence Wolfe of McManus, because

05:10.598 --> 05:21.831
Probably the person that Frank respected most in the book world was Edwin Wolfe, Clarence's cousin, who was the long-time head of the library company, who he was very close friends with.

05:22.231 --> 05:25.275
So Clarence had known him, you know, forever because of that.

05:25.615 --> 05:26.476
Plus the Philly connection.

05:26.496 --> 05:28.058
And the Philly connection, exactly.

05:28.859 --> 05:37.669
So, I mean, I would say the three of us were the ones that were still in touch with him, and in fact at his funeral, besides his immediate

05:37.868 --> 06:04.922
family the only people who went were bailey and clarence who acted as the fall bearers and the only reason i didn't go was i was out of the country but i mean that we were the only people who showed up well you certainly knew about his death did you try to make an attempt to try and do a well private uh the fan you know i think bailey bailey really had the inside track frank had indicated through his family they should talk to bailey bailey was the bookseller that

06:05.695 --> 06:08.137
He had known the longest, who was still around.

06:09.218 --> 06:14.383
I think he had a lot of faith in Bailey, justifiably.

06:14.443 --> 06:22.491
And he told his daughters to, you know, to go to Bailey for help, which they did.

06:23.472 --> 06:31.981
And I tried to persuade Bailey that it would be a good idea to sell me the collection, and Bailey decided to go the auction route.

06:32.821 --> 06:35.584
And I can't blame him for doing that.

06:35.952 --> 06:39.456
Woulda, coulda, shoulda, but, I mean, it's close to six million for part one.

06:40.096 --> 06:40.477
Who knows?

06:40.677 --> 06:42.919
I mean, is part two as strong as part one?

06:42.939 --> 06:50.827
Yeah, I think, you know, they tried to divide it pretty evenly by both size and dollar amounts.

06:52.769 --> 06:57.274
Would you have been prepared to make an offer of five or six million for the equation?

06:57.294 --> 06:58.135
Certainly.

06:58.155 --> 06:58.896
Certainly.

06:58.916 --> 07:03.641
And that's something you would have worked at to... I mean, we're leading into something.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.082
How many booksellers today would be?

07:05.872 --> 07:09.317
prepared to do that kind of a preemptive thing?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.261
Well, probably not that many.

07:12.701 --> 07:18.910
I mean, in the end, this auction has behaved, I guess, it's both predictable and unpredictable what's happened.

07:20.151 --> 07:25.198
It's predictable in the sense that this is ideal situation.

07:25.218 --> 07:29.584
You have a great collection that's been off the market for, you know, decades.

07:30.121 --> 07:40.674
with a collector who's got a great story, whether people really knew him, the way people knew Bradley Martin, or whether he wasn't generally known, but known to the cognizant, like Siebert.

07:41.855 --> 07:47.602
And then you put it all together, and you've got this fabulous stuff, and it's, you know, it's a recipe for people going crazy.

07:49.104 --> 07:56.112
And so, you know, the prices have been realized at this auction that I don't think anybody could have gotten in.

07:57.020 --> 07:57.821
cold blood.

07:57.901 --> 08:15.139
I mean, if I had said to some of my customers who ended up being buyers here, I've got whatever, you know, let's say the Champlain, and it's $400,000, before this sale, I think people would have said, you're nuts.

08:15.159 --> 08:18.163
And I think there are other instances of that in this sale.

08:19.504 --> 08:24.750
You know, the Smith New England at $211,000, which is what it comes to with a hammer.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.892
That's something that was at yours, and there's something you

08:27.327 --> 08:29.189
No, Dick Arkway bought that.

08:29.970 --> 08:36.119
But I don't think anybody, before the sale, I don't think you could have gotten anybody to pay that.

08:37.080 --> 08:51.439
And I mean, it's one of the disadvantages that booksellers struggle with in the modern times, is being able to compete with the auction houses, both as marketers and in terms of being able to secure collections.

08:51.719 --> 08:55.444
Because if a bookseller's going to get a collection, he's got to be willing to come up with the money.

08:56.065 --> 08:59.189
And an auction house doesn't have to necessarily come up with the money.

08:59.269 --> 08:59.750
That's right.

08:59.770 --> 09:01.532
They might have worked something here as they did.

09:01.552 --> 09:10.083
They certainly, here in this case, I mean, Sotheby's, I believe, I don't know this for sure, but I believe advanced the family money to pay the estate taxes.

09:11.064 --> 09:15.449
But, you know, with the books of security, it was a pretty safe bet.

09:15.469 --> 09:24.261
I mean, to get the garden, I forget what it is, I'll have to read my own book, but to get the garden sale, they, I think, wrote out a check for $8 million.

09:24.301 --> 09:24.621
Yeah.

09:25.107 --> 09:29.134
And I don't know what it was here, but here there was that situation.

09:29.915 --> 09:36.946
I don't know the details of the estate other than the books, but I doubt if he had a great deal of liquid funds.

09:37.187 --> 09:42.255
Certainly not enough to pay the taxes on what the appraisal of the collection was.

09:42.275 --> 09:47.704
The appraisal of the collection was basically roughly what the high estimates are.

09:47.724 --> 09:49.647
And so it was appraised, I think,

09:50.048 --> 09:53.834
properly appraised at, you know, five and a half to six million.

09:54.054 --> 09:57.880
So did you make an offer on that, just out of curiosity?

09:58.020 --> 09:59.843
Well, I never really was in a position to.

09:59.963 --> 10:10.639
I solicited being able to make an offer, and the decision had already been made, basically, to go to auction, and the decision had been made to go to either Sotheby's or Christie's.

10:10.679 --> 10:17.328
No, you, I think, you mentioned to me that you accounted for perhaps 60 percent of the action at the first?

10:17.809 --> 10:19.752
Yeah, just about in dollar terms.

10:20.255 --> 10:30.529
I mean, in a sense, it was more than that, because I bought, um, 230 lots of that abouts.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.813
So I bought a little less than half, well, no, it was more than that.

10:33.833 --> 10:38.320
I bought 246 lots, but that was less than half the lots, more than half the value.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.042
It was close to 60% of the value.

10:40.563 --> 10:43.126
But I underbid another 100 lots.

10:43.146 --> 10:49.755
So, in that sense, I was the price maker for two-thirds of the sale, because, uh,

10:50.090 --> 10:53.693
underbidders, as the auction houses will tell you, are just as important as bidders.

10:53.814 --> 10:55.635
That's the whole point of an auction.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.818
Two people want something that only one of them can have, you know?

10:58.998 --> 10:59.359
Yeah.

10:59.379 --> 11:09.589
So, by no means, I mean, it's always interesting, especially when you're in the middle of it, the mythology that gets created around one of these things.

11:09.609 --> 11:18.477
I mean, one of the myths that got created that Arthur Freeman told me about in London, I guess the next week at the London Book Fair, was that I had

11:18.946 --> 11:22.871
bought every lot I bid on, that I'd been utterly invincible.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.714
You know, I stuck my hand up, I didn't stop.

11:25.315 --> 11:26.516
And that wasn't the case at all.

11:26.576 --> 11:37.672
I mean, out of, maybe, I was underbidder on another hundred, and then I had, I literally had a bid written down on every lot.

11:37.852 --> 11:39.995
I mean, sometimes those bids I just knew weren't going to work.

11:40.335 --> 11:40.596
Every lot?

11:40.616 --> 11:41.837
So you prepared to bid on every lot?

11:41.857 --> 11:43.019
I was prepared to bid on every lot.

11:43.159 --> 11:47.485
I mean, in many instances, I knew that there was no point.

11:47.718 --> 11:50.682
But just as an exercise, I did have a bid on every lot.

11:51.703 --> 11:53.766
How much were you prepared to spend of the sale?

11:53.806 --> 11:58.533
I mean, maybe you don't want to tell me that, but did you have a dollar figure in your head that you could handle?

11:58.913 --> 12:00.595
Well, I did.

12:00.615 --> 12:03.319
I mean, really it was a matter of whatever it took.

12:03.399 --> 12:06.163
I mean, I'd known the sale was coming for a long time.

12:06.744 --> 12:11.290
A lot of my bidding was for clients, so I was spending their money, not mine.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.513
That's the question.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.797
And where I was bidding for stock,

12:17.519 --> 12:25.450
You know, I knew that I wasn't going to be successful all the time, or necessarily even the majority of the time.

12:26.311 --> 12:30.917
So, and I'd been kind of saving up for this for some time.

12:30.977 --> 12:31.738
I knew it was coming.

12:32.359 --> 12:35.223
So I was pretty much prepared to do whatever I had to do.

12:36.264 --> 12:40.650
In the end, given the competition, it was very difficult to buy for stock.

12:40.730 --> 12:46.598
I mean, most of the prices were retail or full retail or beyond full retail.

12:47.202 --> 12:51.287
I didn't ultimately spend that much for stock.

12:51.687 --> 12:59.557
Is it possible today for a bookseller of your stature to buy for stock on the scale, say, that Rosenbach did that?

13:00.197 --> 13:01.379
Well, I think it is.

13:01.399 --> 13:09.408
I mean, if you look at the history of Rosenbach's deal, you'll see that he very seldom actually went out and bought those collections.

13:09.428 --> 13:12.552
He almost always worked out some kind of deal.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.737
And this is the kind of thing that was going through my mind.

13:17.594 --> 13:23.602
where he went to his best customers and to some degree involved them in the deal.

13:24.363 --> 13:29.469
He said, look, I've got, I mean, if you look at the great collections he bought in the 20s, he almost always did this.

13:29.489 --> 13:44.749
He'd go to Frank Ultschall or he'd go to, you know, some of his Philadelphia guys and he'd say, Bill Elkins, who is his friend and customer for a long time, say, look, I can buy this, it'll cost me X, you know,

13:44.965 --> 13:51.935
you'll get first choice, you know, the prices will be somewhat better for you, and he didn't, he financed many of the deals that way.

13:51.955 --> 14:03.792
I mean, Rosenbach's goal, and I guess my goal whenever I bought a big collection, was see how quickly you get your money back, and then take it easy.

14:03.812 --> 14:07.197
And that sort of, you know, Roterer or something like that, I mean, he really did that with Ultschul.

14:08.078 --> 14:14.888
He managed to buy the collection, Ultschul bought the majority of it, he ran around like mad, sold enough to

14:15.340 --> 14:16.301
cover the cost.

14:16.782 --> 14:20.926
He was out of it, and then it was after that the gates came down.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.749
Suddenly it was like, well, he took his time, you know.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.271
Marked it up.

14:25.291 --> 14:30.877
For this particular section of the book, I interviewed Tentcher in Switzerland last year before.

14:30.897 --> 14:32.359
I think it was two years ago.

14:33.219 --> 14:38.465
He says that he has perhaps 25 or 30 testaments that he's in business serving.

14:39.366 --> 14:41.408
And, you know, I don't know how it's usually.

14:41.468 --> 14:41.989
He said he does

14:43.775 --> 14:44.656
dollars a year.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.858
Of course, we're talking manuscripts now.

14:48.239 --> 15:03.632
But basically, when you go into a sale like this, are you, I mean, I don't know how many customers you have, and I know you've got a very active website, but are you going into one of these things with the sense that you're buying for years?

15:03.652 --> 15:08.276
You're serving a fine core of clients?

15:08.757 --> 15:09.958
Well, sure.

15:10.078 --> 15:12.820
I mean, in this case, I was bidding for about

15:13.255 --> 15:30.776
20 different people or places, ranging from a single book, a single inexpensive book, to one private individual that was the biggest single buyer in the wholesale, in dollar terms.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.640
So I was really covered in the waterfront there.

15:33.960 --> 15:42.250
I mean, in that sense, I worked with my customers about what they were interested in, what fit with their collections,

15:42.736 --> 15:43.878
how much they were going to bid.

15:45.099 --> 15:51.428
In bidding for stock or buying for stock, wherever you're buying, one's constantly thinking that.

15:51.508 --> 16:03.265
I mean, if you see an important thing and you know already where to sell it, you know who wants it, you can operate on a thinner margin, obviously.

16:03.786 --> 16:06.990
You can make it because you know you can buy it here, sell it there.

16:07.010 --> 16:08.372
You don't need to make as much money.

16:08.825 --> 16:11.508
as if you're buying it just basically on speculation.

16:11.528 --> 16:15.312
It's just going into stock, and you don't know when you're going to sell it.

16:16.193 --> 16:25.703
But by having these commissions beforehand, it does give you the security of knowing that you've already made your nut, so to speak, on part of this sale, and you can shoot the dice on a couple of the others.

16:25.884 --> 16:26.164
Sure.

16:26.304 --> 16:31.290
I mean, there's... Yeah, that's true.

16:31.570 --> 16:32.851
That's true.

16:33.412 --> 16:34.393
You know, I mean, it's...

16:34.492 --> 16:36.054
This is not the kind of thing I'll ever use.

16:36.074 --> 16:36.715
I'm just curious.

16:36.755 --> 16:44.704
Well, I mean, sales like this are a double-edged sword for somebody like me in the long run because, you know, it uses up a lot of customers' money.

16:45.565 --> 16:48.429
And that's what auctions always have on us.

16:48.469 --> 16:49.730
They're time-sensitive events.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.531
They're going to happen.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.252
You've got to be there.

16:51.272 --> 16:52.053
You've got to do it.

16:52.133 --> 16:56.218
And if it's a book you're not going to see again, there's no hemming or hawing.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.040
You're going to put up or shut up.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.946
And so, you know, in several...

17:03.702 --> 17:10.348
three of my best customers are going to have spent their budgets for the year on this sale, and they're not going to have bought any books from me.

17:11.268 --> 17:15.992
And they're going to have bought books that I just assumed would have bought and sold to them.

17:16.012 --> 17:19.415
So, in that sense, these things are terrible.

17:19.495 --> 17:23.319
I mean, I don't particularly want them to go spend all their money with some of these.

17:23.339 --> 17:23.999
But they're not terrible.

17:24.039 --> 17:33.287
This is, I mean, you'd have to agree this is, and this is probably how I'm going to use this, how this sale will fit into my discussion of you.

17:33.841 --> 17:37.084
I'll go over your quotes with you, if you'd like that.

17:37.584 --> 17:39.686
I'm happy to do that, by the way.

17:40.147 --> 17:42.209
I'm happy to do it.

17:42.469 --> 17:51.697
The other side of a sale like this is obviously it's a very important sale to me, in the sense that this is the greatest sale in my field since Screeter.

17:52.478 --> 18:01.266
It's a great landmark sale, and so it becomes an opportunity for me to demonstrate that I'm the dominant figure in the field.

18:02.022 --> 18:05.067
Well, I think we can even take it to a higher level.

18:05.227 --> 18:11.136
We're going in the next set of questions, but would you say this is the last great book sale of the 20th century?

18:12.098 --> 18:13.720
Time's running out, I think.

18:13.740 --> 18:18.027
Well, I mean, it's a fairly... This breaks perfectly for me.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.850
I'll come to the next session, by the way.

18:19.870 --> 18:21.492
Well, I think it is, yeah.

18:21.512 --> 18:25.699
Like the garden sale was the last sale of the Red Hut, White Hut 80s.

18:25.719 --> 18:25.819
Yeah.

18:26.137 --> 18:27.899
Because it happened to be November.

18:27.919 --> 18:29.762
I mean, I don't know what they got there.

18:29.782 --> 18:34.949
Personally, to me, the 20th century ends not in a couple months, but in 15 months.

18:34.969 --> 18:36.031
That's right.

18:36.051 --> 18:36.972
Well, that's right.

18:36.992 --> 18:37.413
Exactly.

18:37.433 --> 18:40.156
I mean, there's nothing else like this on the calendar this year.

18:40.176 --> 18:43.501
I can't see where they're going to pull out anything out of their hat.

18:43.541 --> 18:44.602
But, you know, I don't know.

18:44.963 --> 18:48.267
Well, I think I'd say you're right, because the last great sale of the 90s, that would handle it.

18:48.368 --> 18:50.150
Other things are possible.

18:50.190 --> 18:54.456
Something like the Wentworth sale of last year is not something I would have known about.

18:54.976 --> 18:58.540
and seemed coming the way I knew about this one.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.141
Yeah.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.843
Just as an aside, I'll show you.

19:00.883 --> 19:05.108
This is a typical Siebert correspondence here.

19:05.128 --> 19:06.730
Let's see if we can find a good one.

19:06.750 --> 19:07.211
Are these letters?

19:07.331 --> 19:09.313
Yeah, these are Siebert letters.

19:09.333 --> 19:13.358
And I noticed that they're written on legal pads.

19:14.379 --> 19:19.445
They're generally written, rather, ad infinitum.

19:20.667 --> 19:24.291
They generally touch on...

19:25.030 --> 19:28.795
any number of topics, especially political ones.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.818
Frank was kind of an unreconstructed.

19:31.199 --> 19:35.084
Frank was actually a libertarian of, well, there's a typical Siebert letter.

19:36.807 --> 19:43.737
He was a libertarian, basically, but he thought the world had started to go to hell with FDR, who he always referred to as old jelly legs.

19:44.158 --> 19:46.821
So this is as recent as September 4, 1992.

19:47.482 --> 19:48.043
Yeah.

19:48.063 --> 19:54.953
I mean, I really got, you know, as we got to be good friends, I started to, he was out of touch with what was going on,

19:55.844 --> 19:59.348
And so I found I could get him going on topics.

19:59.428 --> 20:05.294
I would write him and, you know, I'd say, you know, what did you do with the holiday sale or something like that.

20:05.675 --> 20:08.338
And, you know, I'd get back these wonderful letters.

20:08.378 --> 20:15.165
And every time I wrote a catalog, practically, I'd get a letter from him analyzing the catalog.

20:15.305 --> 20:16.527
He'd love to do that.

20:16.587 --> 20:18.129
Is this a sale?

20:18.229 --> 20:22.894
I don't know if that's... Yeah, it's probably a sale.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.817
But he'll, you know, he'll go through...

20:26.489 --> 20:28.972
you know, remarking on... Well, he starts.

20:29.093 --> 20:33.939
I'm quite sick of crooks, lions, and greed.

20:34.360 --> 20:41.570
In fact, I'm fed up with the great society, the medical profession, the politicians, and all the bullshit I see.

20:41.590 --> 20:41.950
Right.

20:42.971 --> 20:51.844
I think that few people realize the enormity of the... It must be... Is that the nadir or the media, do you think?

20:51.864 --> 20:53.225
The nadir, I would think, yeah.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.387
That covers...

20:55.109 --> 20:55.930
the situation.

20:55.950 --> 20:56.871
Or maybe it's the media.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.034
It sounds like it's from the context.

20:59.114 --> 21:03.339
The context is just media, but the media in the country and the world.

21:03.359 --> 21:07.384
He goes on, I don't want to vote for either of the jackasses running for president.

21:07.524 --> 21:09.267
I'm sorry, Ross Perot dropped out.

21:09.807 --> 21:12.851
I think his real reason was that he decided the finances of the U.S.

21:12.891 --> 21:14.493
He goes on about politics here.

21:14.513 --> 21:17.757
Now to America.

21:18.438 --> 21:20.160
And then he goes here.

21:21.602 --> 21:23.184
There are some points that he's discussing.

21:23.484 --> 21:24.846
Three, four, five, six,

21:25.535 --> 21:29.579
So then on page three, he goes to lots of the sale.

21:29.599 --> 21:33.903
Actually, on this page, in your catalog 112, I already have a lot five.

21:34.004 --> 21:36.186
Oh, okay, well, he loves to do this.

21:36.206 --> 21:50.260
He'll go through my catalogs, and then he'll say, well, my copy is, you know, he'll describe what his copy's like, which, of course, is inevitably better than what I'm offering for sale, and he inevitably bought for nothing where I want, you know,

21:51.050 --> 21:52.492
And who's underlining in red?

21:52.512 --> 21:52.993
Is that you?

21:53.033 --> 21:53.614
No, that's him.

21:53.694 --> 21:54.015
That's him.

21:54.035 --> 22:00.346
That's another aspect of cybercorrespondence is the red ink for emphasis.

22:00.366 --> 22:01.307
Here's an example.

22:01.367 --> 22:08.740
I have a perfect copy and an imperfect duplicate of the 1742 Indian Treaty, a conference held at the Fort at St.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.260
George's.

22:09.521 --> 22:15.251
It's apostrophe as Evans 41976, Depew, P-U-I 20.

22:15.691 --> 22:16.753
My imperfect has the

22:17.071 --> 22:47.010
first dupuis dupuis has the first leaf worn with some minor defects and a few letters missing uncut and the last signature photo set why was he he mentions michael zinman michael our friend michael zinman wanted it for his imperfect collection of evans items and gave me a range so michael know him too obviously yeah a range of his estimates of value i accepted his lower figure um so yeah you sold michael's imperfect one michael's fine actually i bought the i bought the

22:47.260 --> 22:49.863
The other went for Yale at the sale.

22:51.625 --> 22:56.951
So, he clearly, quality conditioned matter to this guy.

22:57.051 --> 22:58.072
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

22:58.092 --> 23:00.915
And yet he's making no provisions for the disposition.

23:00.995 --> 23:02.457
No, I mean... I wonder why that is.

23:02.637 --> 23:08.163
Well, I don't think... Frank absolutely hated the institutions.

23:09.204 --> 23:16.913
And while he liked some of the people running the institutions, like Ed Rolton, you know, he liked a lot.

23:17.247 --> 23:19.329
There were librarians he liked individually.

23:23.432 --> 23:32.440
But in his view, he had collected, the heyday of his collecting had been in a great period of major institutional growth and acquisition.

23:33.261 --> 23:38.565
And he viewed it that he'd been kept from getting all these things he wanted because of the institutions.

23:39.666 --> 23:42.288
And so he thought of them as his enemies.

23:42.348 --> 23:46.832
And then they went away, and they never came back on the market.

23:47.150 --> 23:56.630
It would get him spluttering mad to even think about it, and there were some librarians who he particularly felt had, you know, stolen stuff out from under his nose.

23:57.652 --> 23:58.494
That was one thing.

23:58.534 --> 24:07.032
The other thing was one of his best collecting friends was a guy named Robert Decker, who was a Philadelphia collector who gave his Americana collection to Penn.

24:07.838 --> 24:19.651
And there's a Deckard room at Penn, who also, by the way, his home was later bought by Graham Rader in his Valley Domingo, which was Graham's original place, the King of Prussia.

24:19.671 --> 24:25.578
And Deckard had been a very good friend of Frank's, and he felt that Penn had treated the collection very badly.

24:26.018 --> 24:29.002
They dispersed it within their other collections.

24:29.102 --> 24:31.905
They hadn't properly memorialized Deckard and so forth.

24:32.442 --> 24:38.894
And he would always bring that up as an example of what happened if you gave a collection of an institution that the institution wouldn't treat it right.

24:40.216 --> 24:49.613
And toward the end, you know, it was also a very touchy topic with him about his books, as it is with anybody, because he clearly wasn't going to part with it until he was dead.

24:50.274 --> 24:51.596
There's no question about that.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.243
So discussing the future of his collection with him,

24:55.460 --> 25:00.226
which I dared to do a couple times, was a little bit like saying, well, when are you planning to die, Frank?

25:00.246 --> 25:03.170
It's like bringing it up with Bill Scheide, do it at your peril.

25:03.190 --> 25:07.936
Yeah, and, of course, with Scheide, it's kind of much more established.

25:07.956 --> 25:09.278
We all understand what's happening.

25:09.418 --> 25:12.762
Yeah, exactly, and he likes to, you know, keep it.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.384
He hasn't quite done it yet.

25:14.464 --> 25:17.728
You know, I'm not dead yet, but you know what's really going to go on.

25:18.269 --> 25:24.657
But with Siebert, he hated the thought of it going to a collateral institution.

25:25.548 --> 25:37.747
He hated the thought of booksellers, even booksellers he liked, getting their hands on it, and I think he hated the thought of other people getting their hands on his books.

25:38.068 --> 25:46.982
He, at one point, talked to me about setting up an independent library, and I, you know, said that Franklin's just

25:47.182 --> 25:54.111
I mean, you're going to have to have a serious endowment, you've got to have a program, you've got a great collection, but it is what it is.

25:54.191 --> 25:59.117
It's a rare book collection without any resources to back it up.

25:59.438 --> 26:03.403
You know, it would only last a matter of time, and then it would collapse.

26:04.825 --> 26:11.714
I, you know, he was a member of the Antiquarian Society, which I'm on the board of, and AAS didn't have a lot of books there.

26:11.774 --> 26:13.476
I urged him to think about AAS.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.137
I don't know if he ever really seriously did or not.

26:16.177 --> 26:21.264
I think basically you just put it off and put it off, and in the end did nothing.

26:21.344 --> 26:23.988
Well, because there's a couple of kids, is that right?

26:24.028 --> 26:25.049
Two daughters, yeah.

26:25.090 --> 26:30.738
So they're the beneficiaries of this thing.

26:30.758 --> 26:31.058
Yeah, yeah.

26:31.078 --> 26:31.679
How do you feel?

26:31.699 --> 26:33.481
I was at this little thing last night.

26:33.501 --> 26:34.903
I talked to Lou Weinstein.

26:34.923 --> 26:38.108
And you can talk, never mind Lou, but Lou will say this.

26:38.408 --> 26:39.109
I'll say Bill Reese.

26:39.670 --> 26:43.075
He'll say the bookseller of his generation, you know?

26:43.409 --> 26:49.638
How do you respond, and this is not just Bill, but you hear this throughout your profession.

26:49.919 --> 26:51.862
How do you respond when you... You mean me?

26:52.022 --> 26:56.609
Yeah, when you hear yourself being described as the bookseller of your generation.

26:57.109 --> 26:59.753
You're what, 42, 43 now?

26:59.793 --> 26:59.974
44.

27:00.855 --> 27:01.957
Well, it's very flattering.

27:01.977 --> 27:06.904
I mean, I don't... It's very flattering.

27:06.924 --> 27:11.070
I don't really know how you can respond to something like that.

27:11.472 --> 27:13.175
But why do you suppose they say that?

27:13.195 --> 27:16.801
I mean, I think it has to be more than the net, let's put it that way.

27:16.821 --> 27:19.285
It has to be more than the action that's going through the place.

27:19.786 --> 27:32.007
Well, I think... I think that you're a scholar, you bring some scholarly... I mean, we've tried to, you know, we've tried to produce things that are, you know, that are done in a scholarly way.

27:33.830 --> 27:34.611
You know, my colleague

27:34.962 --> 27:39.187
You know, I think booksellers appreciate scholarship as much as anybody.

27:39.447 --> 27:51.782
As you know, there are a lot of, you know, kind of former academics, and, you know, there are a lot of very scholarly people in this business, and I certainly don't think of myself as the most scholarly person in this business by any means.

27:51.802 --> 27:52.783
Who would you nominate?

27:54.225 --> 27:58.049
Oh, somebody like Fred Schreiber.

27:59.091 --> 28:01.393
You'd have to run Barney Rosenthal.

28:01.494 --> 28:02.775
I'd have to give you those, too.

28:02.992 --> 28:30.045
know uh guys like that i mean i i am within my field which is americana um but uh i mean there are other people who in their fields i think are jonathan hill in jonathan's field who i think are you know doing what i am doing um but you know i think i have successfully combined the scholarship

28:30.515 --> 28:41.570
of the book business and being a salesperson and selling the material, and convincing people of the interest of the material.

28:42.030 --> 28:45.875
And, of course, that is something I'd like to discuss.

28:45.915 --> 28:51.062
I mean, the role of the bookseller, Roger Stoddard says everything he's learned, he's learned from booksellers.

28:51.963 --> 28:52.384
Interesting.

28:52.424 --> 28:54.006
And he named them, you know, for the years.

28:54.847 --> 28:57.130
And he says, talk to the booksellers.

28:57.751 --> 29:01.235
They come in and they explain to me why something is really important.

29:01.295 --> 29:02.276
They've really done the work.

29:02.296 --> 29:04.779
Fred Schreiber says the same thing.

29:06.380 --> 29:11.666
Can you speak, address yourself to the function, the role of the bookseller?

29:12.007 --> 29:13.508
Well, yeah, I can very much.

29:13.528 --> 29:17.813
You know, I mean, I really had two mentors when I was an undergraduate at Yale.

29:17.833 --> 29:21.777
One was Archie Hanna, who was the curator of West Virginia Americana, a great guy.

29:22.258 --> 29:27.083
And the other was Manning Charles Montgomery, who was at one time the director of Winter Tour.

29:27.772 --> 29:32.999
and then came to Yale after he left winter tour as a professor of American art.

29:33.019 --> 29:34.281
He was a chaired professor at Yale.

29:34.301 --> 29:35.382
He'd never gone to college.

29:35.763 --> 29:38.006
Charles Montgomery graduate from high school.

29:38.787 --> 29:47.198
And if you know anybody who was interested in American decorative arts, I'll tell you, this man was one of the great figures in the field of American decorative arts.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.883
And Charles started off as a dealer.

29:50.923 --> 29:51.905
He was a furniture dealer.

29:52.906 --> 29:55.129
And ultimately, Henry Francis Dupont hired

29:55.413 --> 30:07.830
Charles, because he was so good, and because Charles really put together a lot of winter tours the way it is now, assembling the period rooms, doing all those things.

30:07.850 --> 30:11.295
By the time I knew him, I mean, he was just an extraordinary figure.

30:12.417 --> 30:23.412
And I think that his ability came from his experience as a dealer, because, and this is what I would argue with him about, because, you know,

30:24.252 --> 30:27.096
I went into the business when I was in college, and he was annoyed at me.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.617
He thought I should have been more of a scholar.

30:28.658 --> 30:31.661
He said, it's like getting married when you're 18 years old, he said.

30:32.602 --> 30:43.676
But I said, well, look where you came from, because I would see people in graduate programs, so let's say in the American Decorative Arts, which I was quite involved with at that point.

30:43.696 --> 30:52.167
And, you know, they were working at the best places, Yale, the Metropolitan, Chipstone out in Minnesota and Wisconsin, rather, winter tour.

30:52.872 --> 30:54.293
They were looking at the best of the best.

30:54.334 --> 31:00.680
They were surrounded by the top 99.5 and up percentile of material.

31:00.700 --> 31:05.105
And the same is true of people who get trained in the big rare book libraries.

31:05.665 --> 31:12.692
You know, they're living, the people who have the best academic access to rare books are living in a very rarefied world.

31:14.154 --> 31:22.002
I live between paper mania and scrounging around, you know, trying to

31:22.201 --> 31:25.966
find things in postcard bins and things like the seabird sale.

31:26.767 --> 31:39.684
And the best dealers I know in the business are people who have had that kind of range in their career, where they've gone from dealing with basically crap to dealing with the best stuff.

31:39.704 --> 31:42.188
So when they see the best stuff, it hits them between the eyes.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.310
And this was what always struck me about Montgomery.

31:45.031 --> 31:47.495
He dealt with that kind of range of material.

31:48.075 --> 31:51.600
The people who are going to graduate school and getting trained in an academic sense

31:52.795 --> 31:56.942
knew the greatest stuff, but it didn't jump out and hit them.

31:56.962 --> 32:08.441
And it didn't have the context that a dealer, an experienced dealer gets, from wading through basically oceans of junk to get to the great stuff.

32:08.521 --> 32:11.726
Zinbin's rule, you know, looking at the post-it, you've got to handle this stuff.

32:12.006 --> 32:13.048
That's right.

32:14.007 --> 32:15.869
The critical mess.

32:15.889 --> 32:16.750
The critical mess.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.611
Theory absolutely applies.

32:18.631 --> 32:27.460
And you handle tons of stuff, and then when you see a gem, or you build up that kind of layers and depth of experience, I think that's what makes great book dealers.

32:27.980 --> 32:31.624
And I think it's why book dealers can explain things to people.

32:31.664 --> 32:33.826
They have that kind of context.

32:34.046 --> 32:34.166
Right.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.067
You have to see it.

32:35.107 --> 32:36.729
Do you see it instantly?

32:37.229 --> 32:40.993
I mean, when you see something great, does it stick out more?

32:41.750 --> 32:48.798
Well, these days, of course, if it doesn't jump out of me, I don't know it, do I?

32:49.239 --> 32:52.883
But I like to think that it does.

32:53.043 --> 32:55.125
But does it happen to you often?

32:55.145 --> 32:58.950
I mean, that you see this... Oh, yeah.

32:59.050 --> 32:59.550
Yeah, it does.

32:59.871 --> 33:00.291
It does.

33:01.373 --> 33:03.555
But, you know, serendipity is...

33:03.991 --> 33:05.993
always an important element in this.

33:08.035 --> 33:15.663
Serendipity is a word that Horace Walpole came up with, and as you know, it's not just chance, but it's chance defined by knowledge and experience.

33:16.805 --> 33:33.002
And so I certainly find time and time again, I'll learn about something, some thing, some area, and it's amazing how quickly that piece of information will be useful, how quickly that'll pop up in my past.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.974
Do you have a good example you can say?

33:38.017 --> 33:39.218
Any good examples?

33:39.238 --> 33:42.942
Yeah, let's see if I can think of a good example.

33:43.483 --> 33:46.526
We can come back to it.

33:46.546 --> 33:49.690
I'm interested also in, you know, I've seen your undergraduate thesis.

33:49.770 --> 33:51.372
Michael has a copy of it.

33:52.133 --> 33:54.195
I mean, you're a kid.

33:55.216 --> 33:58.720
As a kid, I mean, you seem to have known that you want to be a bookseller.

33:58.936 --> 34:02.242
Well, I knew I wanted to work with books, yeah.

34:02.322 --> 34:03.684
What was your major at Yale?

34:04.245 --> 34:05.427
I was a history major.

34:05.828 --> 34:08.853
I actually had a practical use for history major.

34:09.535 --> 34:15.705
But I wasn't sure what context I wanted to work with books, really, until I was in college.

34:15.765 --> 34:18.530
I mean, I knew I wanted to work in books.

34:18.570 --> 34:22.918
I knew I wanted to work in Americana, whether that was in an academic setting.

34:23.405 --> 34:26.590
Now, where does this come from?

34:26.670 --> 34:36.346
I read briefly about your background in Italian countries piece in February, but I still don't get where this great enthusiasm for books.

34:36.486 --> 34:38.529
Yeah, I'm not really sure myself.

34:38.609 --> 34:43.377
I mean, my first real interest stemmed from Audubon.

34:43.397 --> 34:45.801
I was very interested in Audubon.

34:46.220 --> 34:51.446
My father had had autobons back in the 30s, but my father didn't have any money back in the 30s.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.227
He had sold them.

34:52.267 --> 34:53.788
Yeah, he owned a bunch.

34:53.848 --> 34:59.815
At one point, he owned like 30, and he sold them for like $10 apiece.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.057
But we had a couple hanging in the house.

35:02.097 --> 35:07.383
I was very interested in ornithology, and I was fascinated by these autobons.

35:07.463 --> 35:09.966
My father just wasn't interested in them.

35:10.587 --> 35:15.473
My father worked for Coca-Cola for many years.

35:16.074 --> 35:19.639
He started a lot of Coca-Cola bottling plants in all kinds of places.

35:19.959 --> 35:21.441
By this point, he was a gentleman farmer.

35:22.403 --> 35:28.531
And so I got very interested in autobot, which he was interested in.

35:28.991 --> 35:35.019
And so we started going places to look at autobots together, a place like the Old Print Shop, Ken Newman's Old Print Shop.

35:35.039 --> 35:37.302
I mean, I've known him since I was, I guess, 10.

35:38.724 --> 35:40.206
The first time I went in there with my father,

35:40.810 --> 35:45.977
And, you know, my father, I had, what I did with my father, I didn't do little league.

35:45.997 --> 35:47.800
My father and I went to art museums together.

35:49.161 --> 35:53.527
And my father gave great interest in this, although they weren't really collected.

35:53.547 --> 35:55.009
Neither of my parents were really collected.

35:55.650 --> 35:59.556
And I grew up in a house full of books, although neither of my parents were any such book collectors.

35:59.576 --> 36:01.358
There were just a lot of books around to read.

36:02.520 --> 36:07.206
And so reading was a big thing in my family and an important thing.

36:07.226 --> 36:10.210
You know, if you wanted books to read, you know, that was...

36:11.033 --> 36:13.896
You know, my mother would get the books.

36:14.617 --> 36:18.342
So I grew up in a literate context.

36:18.382 --> 36:21.265
There was antiquarian impulse or anything like that.

36:21.746 --> 36:28.014
Not particularly, but, you know, I mean, that really was where my interest came from.

36:28.494 --> 36:35.963
And I've got to say, I look back very fondly on that period because art museums weren't nearly as popular then as they are now.

36:35.983 --> 36:40.028
I mean, I grew up in Maryland, and my father and I used to go down to Washington all the time.

36:40.210 --> 36:42.934
and we'd go to the National Art Gallery, we'd drive in on a Saturday morning.

36:43.715 --> 36:47.440
You could always, we'd get there when it opened, and you could park at a parking meter on the mall.

36:47.521 --> 36:49.163
No parking meters left on the mall.

36:49.423 --> 36:51.446
You could park right there, there's nobody in the place.

36:51.486 --> 36:52.207
It was wonderful.

36:52.247 --> 36:54.831
Yeah, you'd go around, nobody'd bother you looking at the pictures.

36:54.851 --> 36:59.558
Now it's, you know, a massive art mall experience.

37:00.279 --> 37:02.202
So I started going to bookstores with him.

37:02.222 --> 37:05.847
I got more and more interested in books.

37:06.130 --> 37:11.959
met people, you know, I mean, Clarence Wolfe, you know, probably since I was 13 from going in there.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.624
So I was really very interested in it and very involved with it.

37:15.805 --> 37:22.194
And one, I mean, Yale was a place where I have a big family legacy.

37:22.214 --> 37:29.666
A lot of, you know, ancestors went to Yale, so in that sense, if I'd gone somewhere else, I would have annoyed a lot of people.

37:30.347 --> 37:33.792
But the real reason I picked Yale over Harvard, where I could have gone,

37:34.784 --> 37:37.748
was that, uh, was the Rear Book Library.

37:37.768 --> 37:42.535
I know Roger would like to hear that, but... Oh, I'm so afraid.

37:42.555 --> 37:43.957
Um, but, uh... His jaw drops.

37:43.997 --> 37:46.340
That's not exactly a Trump-Liver collection up there.

37:46.380 --> 37:47.301
No, it's not.

37:47.502 --> 37:47.942
It's not.

37:48.023 --> 37:54.231
But, um, you know, the Beinecke is a, is a much more accessible institution than the Houghton is.

37:54.251 --> 37:57.336
And, of course, Americana is a strength here.

37:57.356 --> 38:01.601
Yeah, Americana is a strength here, which is not, I mean, nothing, not something they've never done.

38:02.202 --> 38:02.302
Yeah.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.424
Um, although they've got a lot of

38:04.012 --> 38:07.336
Nothing like here.

38:08.958 --> 38:13.284
So really, in the end, to me, it was a choice of rare book line for everyone.

38:13.404 --> 38:16.028
I've never heard of an undergraduate making that statement, you know?

38:16.108 --> 38:25.700
And once I was here as an undergraduate, there were very many... You were the first undergraduate I've ever met entering a college who was making a selection on the strength of the rare book collection.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.404
And there were very few undergraduates who were that involved.

38:28.424 --> 38:31.588
So, I mean, that was a tremendous help for me, because...

38:32.159 --> 38:50.322
And, you know, once I got to know people like Fritz Liebert and Archie and Don Gallop, who, you know, I took the bibliography from, who were giants in their field, and I was one of the only undergraduates, you know, who was really involved and so forth, and that was a huge leg up for me.

38:50.843 --> 38:56.269
And did you start off immediately as a first-year student going into the Beinecke?

38:56.510 --> 38:57.972
Oh, yeah.

38:58.012 --> 38:58.352
Yeah.

38:58.619 --> 39:01.162
And how did you feel having access to these?

39:01.343 --> 39:02.104
I felt great.

39:02.224 --> 39:04.767
I mean, I went over here and looked at books all the time.

39:04.787 --> 39:05.568
And they really do.

39:05.588 --> 39:09.273
I mean, this is a university, so it's great graduate schools.

39:09.293 --> 39:16.302
I'm really impressed also when I see places like Princeton, you know, which really doesn't have a great graduate program.

39:16.322 --> 39:19.486
You know, they build these special collections with undergraduates in mind.

39:19.866 --> 39:20.307
Yeah.

39:20.708 --> 39:24.252
supportive of the undergraduates coming in and using these things.

39:24.312 --> 39:28.077
Well, Ralph Franklin has really made huge strides in this, I think.

39:28.117 --> 39:34.205
I mean, Beinecke is very, very much a teaching institution now.

39:34.225 --> 39:35.827
They've got classes there all the time.

39:35.867 --> 39:42.775
Right now, they've been able to, you know, they're vast underground complexes under the streets over there.

39:43.456 --> 39:47.521
And what used to be the annex, the Sterling Library, has now been taken over by Beinecke.

39:47.541 --> 39:49.063
You're going to give them a lot more static space.

39:49.103 --> 39:50.445
They're putting in compact shelving.

39:51.117 --> 40:00.869
And so they've taken the top level of one old book stack underground and are putting in a 75-seat lecture hall and two more seminar rooms.

40:00.889 --> 40:03.092
Right now, the seminar rooms there are jammed.

40:03.112 --> 40:07.157
I mean, there are so many courses being taught in Beinecke, using Beinecke materials.

40:07.257 --> 40:08.298
Undergraduate level?

40:08.419 --> 40:09.981
Undergraduate and graduate level.

40:11.122 --> 40:19.993
They've started a series of what they call master classes for graduate students, not necessarily Yale from all over, just on the use of materials and research.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.292
It's a program that Ralph has gotten going.

40:23.312 --> 40:31.099
But lots of undergraduate classes are meeting there and using Beineken materials in the class, and they're really actively trying to expand that.

40:31.119 --> 40:35.323
So that, I think, is just a terrific aspect of what they're doing.

40:35.343 --> 40:37.024
So when does this start to nucleate?

40:37.084 --> 40:38.205
You're here as a freshman.

40:38.225 --> 40:42.309
You're enjoying the Beineken collections enormously.

40:43.710 --> 40:49.035
Well, it's really, you know, I got to be quite good friends with Archie Hanna because that was

40:49.420 --> 40:59.571
At that point, Western American history was my chief interest, and Yale had a great collection of Western Americana, and Archie was a famous figure, and Archie's just a wonderful man.

41:00.251 --> 41:05.236
I mean, he was still happily around and doing very well.

41:05.437 --> 41:08.940
He was on the board of the Goddard Library, which, so I know him.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.881
Sure, of course, yeah.

41:10.602 --> 41:19.191
And, well, of course, the collection he gave the Goddard Library really, he did the work, and after he retired, he had office space with us.

41:19.441 --> 41:48.655
wrote the bibliography of the social novels and so Archie started to introduce me to a lot of people and through him I met Peter Decker who was Archie's best bookseller friend and Archie and Peter used to go on trips every summer together and Peter would usually write up little books about them about their trip and in fact one of the last trips that Peter did because Peter was already in his

41:49.023 --> 41:50.465
I guess about 80 at that point.

41:51.327 --> 41:54.432
Peter, back in 1928, wrote a biography of Benedict Arnold.

41:55.154 --> 41:59.721
And Peter always wanted to recreate Arnold's March on Quebec.

42:00.603 --> 42:11.622
And so on the 200th anniversary of it, in 1976, Archie and Peter and I drove over the Arnold route from Kennebunkport,

42:11.956 --> 42:16.063
through the Maine wilderness up to back and back, which was a lot of fun.

42:16.944 --> 42:22.032
I have somewhere another picture of myself and Peter in the backwoods of Maine.

42:22.052 --> 42:25.698
Pretty funny, because Peter's about 5'2", and I'm 6'3".

42:26.540 --> 42:37.778
But through Peter is really how I ended up in the book business, because an old customer of Peter's died and left this huge collection to his cousin.

42:38.652 --> 42:42.176
who was his nearest relative, who wanted nothing to do with the stuff, wanted it out of the house.

42:42.256 --> 42:43.538
And where was the question?

42:43.558 --> 42:44.539
In Summit, New Jersey.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.623
And the house was worth a lot of money.

42:47.643 --> 42:49.104
It was a big old house.

42:49.124 --> 42:54.891
And the cousin had decided, for no reason I could tell, that she wanted $40,000 for the books.

42:56.453 --> 43:03.542
And I went over there with Peter, and it was just obvious that, you know, even to what I knew then, that this was an incredible story.

43:03.562 --> 43:04.623
Was it an Americana?

43:04.663 --> 43:08.187
Yeah, it was Western Americana, Civil War material.

43:08.504 --> 43:10.266
mainly Western, so good stuff.

43:10.526 --> 43:13.110
Good stuff, yeah, a lot of great stuff.

43:13.130 --> 43:15.873
And Peter said, you know, this is an incredible deal.

43:15.893 --> 43:17.515
You know, he said, I'm 82.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.380
I don't know, I'm not going to mess with this, but... He was 82 at the point.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.561
Yeah.

43:22.581 --> 43:26.346
And Peter would be almost 96, and he was really pretty hale and hearty to the end.

43:27.307 --> 43:33.094
And so I went to my parents and said, you know, I want to borrow the money to buy this and go into the book business.

43:33.547 --> 43:35.389
I was still planning to go to school, I thought.

43:35.429 --> 43:37.571
And what year are you in, though, sophomore year?

43:37.591 --> 43:38.832
I was a sophomore, yeah.

43:38.852 --> 43:39.112
Wow.

43:39.593 --> 43:42.596
And so I talked to them doing that.

43:42.616 --> 43:43.637
And how old were you?

43:43.657 --> 43:44.137
20, 19?

43:44.157 --> 43:47.080
19, yeah.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.482
And the year was about, what, 71 or 18?

43:49.502 --> 43:51.004
75, spring of 1975.

43:51.024 --> 43:52.585
And what year did you graduate?

43:52.605 --> 43:52.945
77.

43:52.965 --> 43:54.247
77, okay.

43:55.568 --> 43:56.649
This is important stuff.

43:56.749 --> 43:59.912
The details are very important.

43:59.932 --> 44:03.115
So I bought the books, and there's 20 tons of books.

44:03.567 --> 44:04.929
Where did you take them?

44:04.949 --> 44:06.031
Where did you move them?

44:06.091 --> 44:09.056
You were living here in New Haven, your home's down in Maryland.

44:09.116 --> 44:17.010
Yeah, and to complicate matters, when I first did this, I was working with a friend of mine named Fred White, who's now dead, who's a Texas bookseller.

44:18.091 --> 44:20.516
So, some of the books were in Texas, some of the books were here.

44:21.337 --> 44:24.863
You know, it's kind of, I was... Were you anxious about this?

44:24.903 --> 44:25.484
Were you nervous?

44:25.524 --> 44:27.347
Did you feel that maybe you were a bit too...

44:27.901 --> 44:35.690
No, because as I said earlier in the conversation, once you get the money back, I was able to get the money back within six months.

44:35.850 --> 44:36.231
Really?

44:36.251 --> 44:40.616
So by the end of that summer, that happened in the spring, by the end of that summer, I paid my parents back.

44:41.577 --> 44:43.639
And how much of the stock did you have left?

44:43.659 --> 44:44.400
Oh, most of it.

44:44.480 --> 44:52.129
I mean, it was an unparalleled learning experience, because one of the hardest things to do in the book business is to buy.

44:52.830 --> 44:54.432
Right.

44:54.665 --> 45:02.613
It's relatively easy to figure out what the best books are, and it's relatively easy to figure out what's great condition, what's not great condition.

45:02.633 --> 45:07.999
What's not easy is to figure out how to buy something at a price that you can make a profit on.

45:08.980 --> 45:15.667
And in this case, I had a lot of room for error, because once I got the cost out, I really couldn't go wrong.

45:16.467 --> 45:20.031
And I certainly sold some things probably too cheaply.

45:20.264 --> 45:21.345
In a way, it was so what?

45:21.365 --> 45:25.309
Can you think of a high spot out of that collection, that sprints tonight?

45:25.729 --> 45:37.200
One of my favorite things in that collection was the uncle of the guy, who's this collection, a guy named Melvin Nichols, and his uncle was a guy named Martin Garretson.

45:37.220 --> 45:42.586
And Martin Garretson was the authority on the American Buffalo.

45:42.646 --> 45:46.069
He wrote kind of the classic, but still on the classic books, the American Bison.

45:46.758 --> 45:51.023
And he'd been very active in the movement to save the bison.

45:51.043 --> 45:56.269
And, you know, Garrison had been, like, out in the West as a kid in the 1870s and 80s.

45:56.289 --> 46:03.418
He ended up as curator in the Museum of Heads and Horns at the New York Zoological Garden, as it was then called.

46:03.458 --> 46:07.863
And Garrison's whole collection had gone to Nichols.

46:08.023 --> 46:15.212
Well, Garrison, in the, I guess, around the turn of the century,

46:15.580 --> 46:19.985
had a long correspondence about Bison with Charles Goodnight, Colonel Charles Goodnight.

46:21.186 --> 46:30.536
And Goodnight's, you know, this great figure in Western ranching history, and it was kind of a... If you see the stuff, by the way, he has to return.

46:30.556 --> 46:32.859
Yeah, I think he says, we'll do that in a couple of minutes.

46:32.959 --> 46:40.187
The constant touchpoint for Larry McMurtry, if you've read any of McMurtry's books, is, you know, it's Old Man Goodnight.

46:40.623 --> 46:51.438
Here were all these wonderful letters from Goodnight, who, you know, had as much experience on the plains with Buffalo as anybody, about his experiences trying to breed cattle and bison.

46:51.458 --> 46:54.021
Do you mind if I snap a couple of pictures of Buffalo?

46:54.782 --> 46:55.063
Not at all.

46:55.704 --> 46:59.028
But that was just, you know, that was a great thing.

47:00.010 --> 47:09.803
I mean, the most amazing thing about the Nichols books were when Peter and I went over to look at the collection, you know, we didn't have that much time.

47:10.205 --> 47:11.547
We went through things quickly.

47:11.567 --> 47:16.494
There was a library room that was maybe twice as big as this room that was lined with bookshelves.

47:17.295 --> 47:21.441
There was, you know, there were books all over the house.

47:22.062 --> 47:31.075
Once we'd done the deal and we started to pack up, I hired a whole bunch of friends of mine from Yale to go over and pack this thing up and load up this, you know, band.

47:31.596 --> 47:35.942
Not band, but it was like an 18-wheeler.

47:37.424 --> 47:41.208
We discovered that all the main room, the whole library, was double-shelled.

47:42.790 --> 47:42.870
Wow.

47:42.890 --> 47:46.355
Which I hadn't realized when I bought the books.

47:46.535 --> 47:48.898
Every shelf in my house is double-shelled.

47:48.918 --> 47:49.358
Yeah, exactly.

47:49.438 --> 47:52.262
I mean, I might have guessed, but they had glass-front bookcases.

47:52.282 --> 47:54.745
You know, it wasn't easy to get into them.

47:54.765 --> 47:57.628
You know, it turned out there were twice as many books in there.

47:59.490 --> 48:06.098
The other great bunch of stuff, the Nichols stuff, was that his

48:06.466 --> 48:09.969
His next-door neighbor, when he grew up, was a guy named Charles Francis Bates.

48:10.350 --> 48:17.997
Charles Francis Bates was the son of Agnes Bates, who was Elizabeth Custer's best friend.

48:18.357 --> 48:22.241
Agnes Bates was also a widow, a 7th Cavalry widow.

48:22.801 --> 48:24.182
Her husband was killed a little bit more.

48:25.604 --> 48:28.987
Mrs. Custer and she lay about houses next to each other in Bronxville.

48:29.768 --> 48:33.971
Charles Francis Bates grew up running into Mrs. Custer's house.

48:34.532 --> 48:35.713
She got into West Point.

48:36.149 --> 48:38.092
ultimately left the army and became a lawyer.

48:38.853 --> 48:51.490
And when people started writing, you know, kind of nasty revisionist books about Custer in the 20s, like Frederick Vanderwater's Glory Hunter and books like that, he became the main flat catcher.

48:51.510 --> 49:00.081
He'd go out and write articles attacking the people who wrote the revisionist books and say, well, Mrs. Custer ended up leaving him her library.

49:00.972 --> 49:10.162
So there were all these books there from Mrs. Custer's library, books inscribed into Mrs. Custer, you know, Tending on the Plains, inscribed into Mrs. Custer.

49:10.803 --> 49:13.145
They're wonderful Custer stuff.

49:13.506 --> 49:23.917
Colonel Custer's necktie, which is a great, you know, one of those great unprovable artifacts, you know, a little red bow necktie, said they were going to Custer.

49:23.937 --> 49:29.443
I'm interested also in how a bookseller helps institutions

49:30.301 --> 49:31.963
build their collections.

49:31.983 --> 49:35.226
I know you've done a lot of work with institutions.

49:35.286 --> 49:37.108
I mean, you have private collectors you work with.

49:38.209 --> 49:43.635
Do you have any thoughts on how you've worked with various institutions to help them?

49:44.256 --> 49:51.263
Well, I think, as you certainly know, with all the time you spend in the book world, I mean, this business has gotten more and more specialized.

49:52.325 --> 50:00.173
And the specialist bookseller and the institutions that are interested in whatever particular areas are going to have a natural affinity

50:00.558 --> 50:01.279
for each other.

50:02.100 --> 50:17.795
So the collection, the institutions that really collect strongly in the fields where I'm strong, I tend to know, I tend to have a pretty good sense of what they have, what they're trying to build, what their strengths are, where they want to fill in cracks, things like that.

50:18.856 --> 50:29.046
I think that's the main thing, that there's a collegial feeling that I have, and I think most of my colleagues have,

50:29.600 --> 50:32.464
with the people who are the specialists in their field.

50:33.346 --> 50:43.260
And so, obviously I'm trying to sell books, but I'm also thinking, well, you know, who does this fit with the best if I get a piece?

50:44.161 --> 50:57.241
Can you think of some people in the academic world who you've worked with who I might ask a comment about their relationship, their professional relationship?

50:57.261 --> 50:58.763
Well, I mean, I've got

50:59.232 --> 51:01.996
Contacts in the academic world and contacts in the library world.

51:02.016 --> 51:13.392
I mean, as a collector, I've had probably more contacts with the academic world, because with Melville, for instance, where I have probably the best collection of private hands.

51:14.114 --> 51:14.955
And this is your collection?

51:14.995 --> 51:15.235
Yeah.

51:15.796 --> 51:20.683
Oh, see, we haven't even talked about Bill Reese's objective.

51:21.102 --> 51:25.130
You know, lots and lots of Melville scholars have come here and used my materials.

51:25.350 --> 51:27.515
Can you briefly describe the collection?

51:27.675 --> 51:31.883
Well, what I have that's most significant, I think, are books from Melville's library.

51:31.903 --> 51:36.853
There are two main institutional collections, both of which stem immediately from the family.

51:37.735 --> 51:40.220
I'm just going to turn this on the other side.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.001
It's getting too close.
