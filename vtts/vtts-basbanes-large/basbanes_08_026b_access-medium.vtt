00:02.663 --> 00:03.805
I just talked briefly.

00:03.825 --> 00:08.010
You said you're wearing your Wisconsin jacket, and you say, I earned it.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.455
I played football.

00:14.118 --> 00:18.604
I played football in Madison and loved it.

00:19.665 --> 00:28.557
And I was, thank God, I wasn't really quite fast enough, and I wasn't big enough going to the pros, because I would have.

00:29.438 --> 00:31.040
Oh, Christ, I love playing football.

00:31.060 --> 00:31.761
You're tough enough.

00:31.781 --> 00:32.282
Fool on that.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.980
Well, I wasn't big enough, and I went fast enough.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.084
Big Ten football is tough football.

00:38.104 --> 00:49.617
Well, we were number two my junior year, and my claims to fame in football are that I played.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.784
And I'm the last Big Ten player to have played a 60-minute game.

00:55.505 --> 00:56.346
Okay.

00:56.366 --> 01:02.573
And my senior year was the last year in which they didn't have, you know,

01:02.992 --> 01:04.193
Didn't have a limited subject.

01:04.213 --> 01:05.775
You did not have unlimited subject.

01:05.795 --> 01:08.118
Did this, for the record, tell you the positions once again?

01:08.818 --> 01:13.023
I was left guard and middle on offense and middle linebacker on defense.

01:13.043 --> 01:13.704
You worked pretty good.

01:13.724 --> 01:15.506
You don't look like you'd get any injuries or anything.

01:15.526 --> 01:16.547
That's why I was so lucky.

01:16.587 --> 01:19.870
If I had a guy in the pro football, I know what would happen.

01:19.890 --> 01:24.735
I mean, it's ridiculous for someone my size to talk about it today, but this was 1956.

01:24.776 --> 01:27.959
That's 40 years ago.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.644
And at 200, I was big enough for the Big Ten.

01:33.704 --> 01:36.327
If I'd have been 210, I would have been big enough for the pros.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.069
I could have played linebacker in the pros.

01:41.153 --> 01:43.376
If I'd have done that, I lasted three, four years.

01:45.218 --> 01:47.861
You didn't pay all that much in those years.

01:48.422 --> 01:50.865
And I wouldn't be able to rock today.

01:51.546 --> 01:56.252
All these guys, their knees, I mean, it just takes such a pounding, and I would.

01:56.412 --> 01:58.935
And so I was very lucky that I wasn't good enough.

02:00.670 --> 02:05.299
That would have been a four-year delay in getting started in my career, and... It would have been different.

02:05.319 --> 02:06.541
It really would have been different.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.184
Again, we talk about these little moments.

02:08.605 --> 02:11.410
We don't know what they could have bring, but there's one right there.

02:11.931 --> 02:16.079
Before we go out, I may have kindly inscribed this for me.

02:18.443 --> 02:19.004
If you want it.

02:19.024 --> 02:19.986
I'm super glad you can stop it.

02:20.006 --> 02:20.687
We need the tape anyway.
