WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:06.869
And a lot of the people who I write for have probably never seen that.

00:06.969 --> 00:14.732
I mean, I know you've been asked a dozen times, maybe a hundred times, about the circumstances.

00:15.438 --> 00:20.343
You're contriving a plot to murder the ex-husband.

00:20.744 --> 00:23.507
In fact, he still lives in Santa Barbara.

00:23.527 --> 00:27.852
I always thought he would sue me for saying that, but so far he hasn't.

00:27.872 --> 00:33.758
But generally, if I speak to large groups of people, I check to see if his attorney is sitting in the audience.

00:33.778 --> 00:35.680
I thought about that, actually.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.785
At least he could probably claim some royalties.

00:40.185 --> 00:41.166
Right, right.

00:41.206 --> 00:43.909
I've been dining out on this story for years.

00:44.092 --> 00:47.055
But we went through a very bitter divorce.

00:47.075 --> 00:48.356
This was many years ago.

00:48.376 --> 00:49.857
It was in the early 70s.

00:50.778 --> 00:53.460
And he put me through three custody battles.

00:53.560 --> 00:58.605
And I was... I know I do that when I'm doing research.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.867
You always have to make sure the wheels are turning.

01:01.507 --> 01:03.529
Yes, I'll watch the red light.

01:04.210 --> 01:06.272
I didn't know how to fight.

01:06.412 --> 01:08.934
I thought you could get through life being a nice girl.

01:09.535 --> 01:12.377
So I thought it just will suffice that I'm a good girl.

01:12.762 --> 01:16.848
And apparently that's not the way it works when you're in the middle of a bitter divorce.

01:16.928 --> 01:21.075
So I used to lie awake thinking of ways to do this man in.

01:21.335 --> 01:24.360
And I just thought, I'm sure serious.

01:25.061 --> 01:27.765
I told my wife, Mr. Hewlett.

01:27.906 --> 01:28.386
Oh, absolutely.

01:28.406 --> 01:29.268
And she said, that's wonderful.

01:29.348 --> 01:36.098
I mean, the trick is I've been a law-abiding citizen all my life.

01:36.219 --> 01:36.559
So...

01:37.028 --> 01:55.096
I knew myself well enough to know that if I really tried to act it out, I'd fluff it, you know, because the minute the cops knocked on the door, I'd babble out a confession, and then I'd end up in prison, wearing those terrible prison clothes, eating starched food.

01:55.957 --> 02:01.045
So I thought, well, wouldn't it be wonderful to put this in a book and...

02:01.295 --> 02:02.597
get paid for it.

02:02.617 --> 02:07.344
See, then you have the pleasure of doing somebody in without having to pay the price.

02:08.025 --> 02:12.511
And if you can pick up a couple of bucks in the process, we're way ahead of the game.

02:12.952 --> 02:16.697
And every time you tell this story, you're kind of getting... I know, I know.

02:16.898 --> 02:18.680
I mean, that's the truth.

02:19.141 --> 02:25.530
And Nancy, I was smart enough, though, to realize that I couldn't tell this story from the killer's point of view.

02:25.983 --> 02:28.085
because it'd be a real short series, right?

02:28.165 --> 02:33.952
I don't think you can do 26 books from various pathological points of view.

02:33.972 --> 02:40.158
Well, we'll get to that in a second, but I'm curious about the A, this alphabet device.

02:40.218 --> 02:48.908
Well, yeah, so a lot of things were happening simultaneously that fulminate in this decision to do the alphabet.

02:49.769 --> 02:55.635
I was working in Hollywood at the time, and I'd been there probably eight years, six or eight.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.865
and it was driving me crazy.

02:58.406 --> 03:12.344
I was making good money or what seemed like good money then and I got sick of sitting in meetings at the network with people who were 26 years old telling me how to do my business.

03:12.824 --> 03:16.309
I've been at it too long and most of them had never actually written a word.

03:16.329 --> 03:23.057
They'd all gone to film school so that made them experts on how to write things and I got crankier and crankier and I

03:23.290 --> 03:25.573
They've reached a point where I thought, this isn't right.

03:25.653 --> 03:29.337
If something's making you that angry that often, it's a clue.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.900
She felt like I'm smart enough to figure that out.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.564
So I said, you know, if you don't like the game, don't take the money.

03:35.764 --> 03:37.966
Pardon me, but are they really 26 years old?

03:38.427 --> 03:40.129
Oh, hey, I'm exaggerating.

03:40.149 --> 03:41.210
Some are younger than that.

03:41.230 --> 03:42.031
Oh, yeah.

03:43.753 --> 03:48.218
I mean, sometimes they'll bring in an intern who's a college student,

03:48.468 --> 03:52.072
And you're sitting in this meeting, there's always a guy named Steve with a mustache.

03:52.092 --> 03:57.158
You don't know who he is, but you've got to be polite, because he's going to be the head of the network year after next.

03:57.178 --> 04:05.308
And you're sitting there, and they'll say, well, Steve had a good idea for your script, so you're sitting there, you know, you're taking notes, and Steve gives you the worst idea you ever heard.

04:05.568 --> 04:08.071
Then you find out he's a goddamn intern.

04:09.673 --> 04:11.595
And you have to be polite.

04:12.276 --> 04:17.462
But so I thought to myself, it is time to get back to solo writing, because I started out doing...

04:17.847 --> 04:18.869
mainstream fiction.

04:18.969 --> 04:19.690
I had a couple.

04:19.710 --> 04:20.431
You had a couple.

04:20.451 --> 04:20.812
Yeah.

04:21.933 --> 04:22.995
Who were they with, by the way?

04:23.015 --> 04:23.336
Which host?

04:24.017 --> 04:25.719
One was Macmillan in 1967.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.742
That was Poseidon Day.

04:28.484 --> 04:33.291
And then I had a book published just in England by Peter Owen Limited.

04:33.351 --> 04:35.194
That was called The Wally Madonna War.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.037
These must be very collectible books.

04:37.253 --> 04:37.894
They are.

04:37.974 --> 04:46.041
The Brits discovered that their rights had never reverted, and they were going to do me the incredible favor of reprinting them.

04:46.061 --> 04:47.182
They all kind of fit.

04:48.203 --> 04:57.271
But the Brits are so terrific, because when my agent told the head of Macmillan that I was horrified of the idea, he said, I'm wrong.

04:57.452 --> 04:58.172
Isn't that interesting?

04:58.192 --> 05:00.334
I was fabulous, fabulous.

05:00.354 --> 05:02.436
Surprisingly decent.

05:02.776 --> 05:03.757
Completely decent.

05:03.817 --> 05:06.720
I'm not sure what an American publisher would have done that.

05:07.038 --> 05:12.125
Anyway, I had had my bitter divorce, so I had schemes for doing the man in.

05:12.165 --> 05:17.612
I was about sick of Hollywood, and I knew it was time to salvage whatever talent I had left.

05:18.493 --> 05:25.843
And Hollywood was saying to me, they would say to me in these meetings, well, you know how to do character, but you cannot do plot.

05:26.304 --> 05:27.325
So that pissed me off.

05:27.345 --> 05:33.754
I thought, well, I'm going to teach myself how to do plot, and I'll stick it to you where the sun never shines.

05:34.038 --> 05:35.239
Then I was reading.

05:35.299 --> 05:37.541
My father, you know, had done mystery fiction.

05:37.561 --> 05:40.103
So I had always thought I would try one.

05:41.425 --> 05:46.289
One of my questions for later on, before I forget, is did you learn anything from C.W.?

05:46.749 --> 05:48.411
I'll tell you what I learned from that guy.

05:50.293 --> 05:52.775
So I was reading these Edward Gorey cartoons.

05:53.335 --> 05:54.196
Which are wonderful.

05:54.216 --> 05:55.918
Oh, at the Gashley Crumb Tynies.

05:56.018 --> 05:59.141
I swear one day I'm going to learn that whole set of rhymes.

05:59.941 --> 06:04.045
But it did occur to me that you could do a series of books based

06:04.430 --> 06:08.395
on crime words that pertain to the alphabet.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.636
That's a great, great.

06:10.077 --> 06:12.259
I know librarians love me, booksellers love me.

06:12.279 --> 06:14.922
Yeah, but so Gloria was the... Oh yeah.

06:14.982 --> 06:16.264
I haven't seen that anywhere.

06:16.284 --> 06:18.927
Oh, that was... What was the book once again?

06:18.947 --> 06:22.871
The book is called The Gashley Crumb Tiny, G-A-S-H-L-Y-C-R-U.

06:23.813 --> 06:26.195
I'll find it, I'll find it.

06:26.576 --> 06:31.922
And it goes, A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, B is for

06:32.223 --> 06:34.686
Basil, assaulted by bears.

06:35.607 --> 06:38.490
Excuse for Clara, who died of the plague.

06:38.510 --> 06:43.636
I mean, you know, all these little Victorian children stabbed and burned and falling off bridges.

06:43.716 --> 06:44.958
It was very droll.

06:45.759 --> 06:55.530
So I sat down and sketched out as many words as I could think of in alphabetical order to see if, in fact, there were enough to go around.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.370
And some of those titles were, I have always, you know, it was always A is for alibi, B is for burglary, C is for corpse, D is for dead boot.

07:04.390 --> 07:09.155
A couple of them changed as I actually got to the book.

07:09.175 --> 07:10.117
Did you get 26?

07:11.078 --> 07:12.099
More or less.

07:12.119 --> 07:19.948
There are some letters that are puzzlers, but I don't worry about anything that's not happening right this minute.

07:20.671 --> 07:23.134
Right now we're worried about him.

07:23.494 --> 07:26.778
Right, and it's not going to be for murder, I can promise you that.

07:26.798 --> 07:33.926
I don't know what it'll be for, and I guessed wrong a couple of times, so now I try to be kind of quiet about it, unless I know.

07:33.946 --> 07:46.240
Yeah, if I know what a title is, I'll always tell, but I thought L was for libel, so I spent a long time doing research about product liability and couldn't make the story work.

07:46.878 --> 07:55.509
So you really do get the title, and then the story, and then the... An exception with K. I thought K was for kidnap.

07:56.310 --> 08:03.399
And I worked on a storyline for four months, and I had to finally admit to myself, it's a federal crime.

08:03.859 --> 08:08.245
Kinsey Milhorn would never be called in for any reason whatsoever.

08:08.663 --> 08:13.530
So then I thought, I better call it Chaos for Killer, because that'll cover a multitude of sins.

08:13.610 --> 08:17.375
No matter what I come up with, all I have to have is a murder in that one.

08:18.036 --> 08:20.139
And so that's the one I ended up with.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.507
So you did have the idea when you sold the first book.

08:25.527 --> 08:29.712
This is the first of 26 and possibly... Well, you know how that goes.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.296
You're writing a book, you don't know if you're going to sell it.

08:32.697 --> 08:37.303
You can be full of energy and hope and have great faith in the system, but...

08:38.296 --> 08:39.862
But the concept was there.

08:40.344 --> 08:48.036
Yes, and maybe you sell the first and it never goes anywhere and nobody ever invites you to proceed down the alphabet.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.254
I sold A.S.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.780
for Aladon to Marion Wood on the basis of 65 pages.

08:53.682 --> 08:55.865
There was no, and she didn't do mysteries.

08:55.885 --> 08:56.707
I don't think she knew anything.

08:56.727 --> 08:59.331
I read some quotes from her that she didn't do any of this at all.

08:59.471 --> 09:01.895
But she thought the voice was wonderful.

09:02.316 --> 09:03.958
Well, she thought I knew what I was doing.

09:04.099 --> 09:05.421
Imagine my surprise.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.364
I thought, shit, they're going to pay me money.

09:07.484 --> 09:09.067
Now I've got to finish the book.

09:09.948 --> 09:12.753
But I feel like that to this day.

09:12.773 --> 09:15.357
Every book I do is a surprise to me.

09:16.349 --> 09:18.593
You always feel like you've done it all.

09:18.613 --> 09:20.996
Are you ever anxious going into one?

09:21.016 --> 09:22.759
I mean, there is expectation.

09:23.100 --> 09:23.841
I don't know.

09:24.181 --> 09:24.582
Anxious.

09:24.802 --> 09:26.625
I'm fearful every day.

09:27.206 --> 09:29.290
It can be a form of energy.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.273
It can also really get in your way.

09:31.293 --> 09:37.302
So a lot of my process is just trying to get calmed down to a point where I can do the work.

09:38.004 --> 09:41.729
Sometimes I think my job as a writer is to get out of my own way.

09:42.531 --> 09:43.352
And, you know,

09:43.417 --> 09:45.800
Are you confident that each one is better than the last?

09:46.400 --> 09:53.709
I don't... See, one of the things I've had to learn, and one of the reasons I love what I'm doing is... Okay.

09:54.690 --> 10:01.237
Okay, one of the reasons I love what I'm doing is that I am learning all kinds of things.

10:02.238 --> 10:10.167
One of the things I'm learning is to give up the notion that I can control how other people feel about these books.

10:10.552 --> 10:35.293
other readers will say this is better than the last but that isn't mine to worry about my job is to write each book as well as i can and trust it to do whatever it needs to do so sometimes i get trashed by reviewers i got trashed by the new york times for years for evidence and do you have a thin skin for reviews yeah

10:35.577 --> 10:41.402
I'm beginning to understand that bad reviews are about one person's opinion.

10:41.422 --> 10:41.562
Yeah.

10:42.563 --> 10:49.389
I have to say, this is my first book, and I'm 52, you know.

10:49.409 --> 10:50.710
It's not like I'm a kid.

10:50.730 --> 10:51.691
Yeah, yeah.

10:52.412 --> 11:04.302
But I got one snotty, snotty review, which I mean, I was sore for a week.

11:04.484 --> 11:06.466
I understand that.

11:06.627 --> 11:12.634
Well, I have never forgotten a gal in some part of Texas who said, B is for boring.

11:13.835 --> 11:16.278
To be accused of being boring, would you die?

11:16.418 --> 11:24.928
Well, the guy who published his week, he said, the Bible was big, it's 688 pages, 250,000 words, and the history of it.

11:24.948 --> 11:28.753
And the guy says, he's included everything, including the kitchen sink.

11:29.527 --> 11:31.509
And I feel like saying, well, where is the kitchen sink?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.632
Tell me what page it's on, you know?

11:33.732 --> 11:36.415
Because it's a wise-ass remark.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.438
Everything else has been wonderful.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.921
I have a full page in the Washington Post.

11:40.981 --> 11:41.862
I have a third printing.

11:42.123 --> 11:42.783
I'm only a month old.

11:43.364 --> 11:44.265
You don't have that anyway.

11:44.546 --> 11:47.209
Well, you have to give that up.

11:47.369 --> 11:52.996
I mean, I always react with a wince to that.

11:53.016 --> 11:56.040
It's like being insulted by somebody you never even met.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.723
Like, what did I do to you?

11:59.176 --> 12:01.459
But you must hear wonderful things from your readers.

12:01.699 --> 12:02.080
I do.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.744
And here's the other thing you have to learn.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.806
It's like it's all the same.

12:06.947 --> 12:14.837
The negative and the positive, the good reviews and the bad, none of them help you write the next sentence well.

12:14.857 --> 12:15.178
No, don't.

12:15.358 --> 12:16.540
I am a one-man band.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.222
Forgive me for moving away.

12:18.302 --> 12:18.983
Okay, okay.

12:19.003 --> 12:19.424
Just keep talking.

12:19.444 --> 12:20.065
That's okay.

12:20.105 --> 12:21.446
So I can still talk to you?

12:21.466 --> 12:22.027
Oh, please.

12:22.107 --> 12:22.448
Okay.

12:22.488 --> 12:25.572
That's what's happening right there.

12:26.260 --> 12:32.006
It's just as dangerous in a way to listen to the praise and start thinking of hot shit.

12:32.386 --> 12:37.211
That's worse for you than being a little bit insulted or wounded.

12:39.072 --> 12:41.435
So I try to disregard it all.

12:41.575 --> 12:45.358
And in fact, Marian, I've told her I don't want to read reviews.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.561
You know, it just doesn't help me.

12:47.581 --> 12:48.722
So she doesn't send them to you now?

12:48.742 --> 12:49.402
Nope.

12:49.422 --> 12:49.743
Really?

12:49.943 --> 12:50.163
Yeah.

12:50.684 --> 12:51.745
We talked about the readers.

12:51.765 --> 12:54.327
Do you have a reader and my reader writing these books?

12:54.526 --> 12:57.490
No, I write them until they sound right to me.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.193
So you look basically for yourself?

12:59.293 --> 13:08.026
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:08.046 --> 13:10.089
You do a lot of research for all of your books, too.

13:11.050 --> 13:14.355
Could you tell me a little bit about some of the things you've done for Paris?

13:14.395 --> 13:17.299
Oh, how great.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.943
Happily, I've never been arrested.

13:20.395 --> 13:30.807
So in H's for Homicide, when I knew that Kinsey Milhorn was going to get self-arrested so she could make contact with Viviana Diaz, I went over to the jail.

13:30.867 --> 13:34.211
Unfortunately, I live in a wonderful small town where they will help me.

13:34.691 --> 13:37.094
And they walked me through the booking process.

13:37.114 --> 13:39.817
This is Santa Barbara, which is in my book, by the way.

13:39.837 --> 13:41.759
Do you know a fellow by the name of Dave Karpelis?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.663
Yes, I just, honestly, he looks around the corner for me.

13:44.683 --> 13:45.584
It's in my book.

13:45.604 --> 13:46.164
Oh, really?

13:46.645 --> 13:49.508
I went over to their house doing a piece of research.

13:49.589 --> 13:49.930
Really?

13:49.990 --> 13:51.512
For the next book I'm doing.

13:51.612 --> 13:51.752
Okay.

13:52.093 --> 13:59.204
Because I'm thinking it has, there's some little piece of business, which I will not reveal at this point, but David and Marcia are wonderful people.

13:59.224 --> 14:02.529
You should read my chat, my little section on there.

14:02.549 --> 14:03.330
I will.

14:03.350 --> 14:04.912
I'm very curious about them.

14:05.153 --> 14:07.556
Well, I, and I know a lot more about them.

14:07.737 --> 14:08.117
I bet.

14:08.137 --> 14:09.279
Then you put it down.

14:09.399 --> 14:10.461
That's good.

14:10.541 --> 14:13.666
If you're interested, you can call me and say, I'll give you a lot of time.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.487
Okay, okay.

14:14.507 --> 14:14.567
Um,

14:15.256 --> 14:18.361
That's irrelevant to what we're talking about here.

14:18.782 --> 14:20.184
I'm sorry, the police.

14:21.526 --> 14:26.574
My daughter, my younger daughter, said, make sure you tell Sue Grafton we live in Grafton.

14:26.594 --> 14:27.916
Yes, my town.

14:28.016 --> 14:29.378
I give you permission.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.283
Yeah, what else have I done?

14:33.505 --> 14:36.990
I've been through... You went through an autopsy once?

14:37.311 --> 14:38.933
I've never been to an autopsy.

14:39.013 --> 14:40.656
I've been in many morgues.

14:41.243 --> 14:53.818
but I hear autopsy or nasty things, and I understand you can get them on tape now, and I think that might feel, because it's the smell and the sound that I hear is so appalling, and I'm fairly squeamish.

14:54.299 --> 14:59.505
I don't mind dead bodies at all, it doesn't bother me a bit, but hacking and sawing on human flesh.

14:59.645 --> 15:03.950
As a cub reporter, I walked into one by the swamp.

15:04.030 --> 15:08.736
I swear to God, you don't even know the story, but I was drowning, and I was out,

15:09.037 --> 15:16.834
I was looking around, and I walked into this room, and there was a pathologist with this present.

15:18.899 --> 15:22.667
You backed out of that one pretty quick.

15:22.687 --> 15:26.235
I'm pretty tough, but that's what I'm doing.

15:26.333 --> 15:31.999
How about before we forget the influence of your father and mine?

15:32.019 --> 15:41.349
My father died four months before A is for Alibi was published, and he had not read the book because I wanted to present him with the real thing.

15:42.370 --> 15:53.742
But because he wrote himself, he often talked about writing, and I think maybe consciously or unconsciously he was grooming me to do this.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.403
Well, he was doing this.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.207
This was decidedly a male province, though.

15:59.227 --> 15:59.327
Yeah.

15:59.828 --> 16:07.758
But see, the thing about my parents, it never occurred to them to tell me you couldn't do something because you were female.

16:08.238 --> 16:11.282
So that message was never given to me one way or the other.

16:11.783 --> 16:13.946
What my father taught me was to work hard.

16:14.446 --> 16:16.489
They taught me about meritocracy.

16:16.891 --> 16:22.960
And with meritocracy, it doesn't matter if you're male or female, black, white, it just doesn't pertain.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.384
What matters is do you have the ability?

16:25.464 --> 16:26.485
And are you patient?

16:26.565 --> 16:28.588
And are you tough enough to take it?

16:29.350 --> 16:33.396
So he taught me, he used to say, keep it simple.

16:34.898 --> 16:41.768
He would say, it is miracle enough that I can have a thought in my head converted into a

16:42.001 --> 17:06.743
marks on a page that you look at so that the same thought forms in your head so he would always say the writer must never do anything to interfere with that communication so he said spell correctly use proper punctuation yeah and he would teach me for instance he said transitions are important

17:07.465 --> 17:10.931
This is why you were working on A is for Alibi, or even when you were younger?

17:11.032 --> 17:13.877
No, this was just when I started writing when I was 18.

17:15.740 --> 17:18.265
I had nothing to say, but I did it very earnestly.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.569
And the thought was fiction, of course.

17:20.589 --> 17:20.870
Yes.

17:21.731 --> 17:26.219
So he would say to me, every writer has the big scenes.

17:26.239 --> 17:29.305
If you're thinking of a novel, you always imagine the big

17:30.095 --> 17:36.564
confrontations, but he said, if you don't take care of the transitional scenes, you won't have a reader when you get to the vision.

17:36.704 --> 17:39.888
My sense is that you do write very visually, though.

17:39.968 --> 17:42.752
That's what I learned in Hollywood.

17:42.772 --> 17:44.434
But it is kind of paradoxical.

17:45.195 --> 17:49.521
I've read also that no way would you ever sell this character to these people.

17:49.541 --> 17:50.442
That's right.

17:50.462 --> 17:51.284
That's right.

17:51.304 --> 17:57.752
I mean, she must be a rather sacred... They would wreck my work.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.815
You know, I've had too many years

18:00.048 --> 18:02.251
people telling me how to do my work.

18:02.271 --> 18:03.713
I don't tolerate that anymore.

18:04.374 --> 18:12.626
I need, certainly with Marian Wood, I need feedback and I need another untutored eye.

18:12.686 --> 18:18.935
Somebody saying this is confusing, this needs to be expanded on or cut.

18:19.516 --> 18:23.202
You need somebody to give you honest feedback.

18:23.762 --> 18:29.751
I've talked to a number of writers who feel that the space that we do this

18:30.693 --> 18:37.580
perhaps because we love it, but we also do it because we have to live, and that's how we make our living.

18:37.600 --> 18:45.207
And if it became a viable source of income for you, the books are yours.

18:45.227 --> 18:50.132
I mean, don't you accept that they could do something with the character?

18:50.252 --> 18:51.733
I don't.

18:52.014 --> 18:58.540
I don't want to ever give them permission to tamper with my work.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.302
There was an arrogance.

19:00.342 --> 19:01.484
You must have had a tough time.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.405
Oh, I did.

19:03.246 --> 19:06.250
Yeah, and it was a good lesson.

19:06.491 --> 19:08.694
I'll tell you what I learned in Hollywood.

19:08.714 --> 19:12.339
The other thing my father taught me was to pay attention to minor characters.

19:14.262 --> 19:17.006
What I learned in Hollywood, see, I'm a smart girl.

19:17.146 --> 19:19.249
I learn a lot of things from a lot of people.

19:19.810 --> 19:27.902
I learned how to structure a story, and the mystery structure is terribly important, and it's also important in screenplay for one.

19:28.473 --> 19:31.837
I learned how to write dialogue.

19:32.177 --> 19:36.021
I learned how to be economical, how to get into a scene and get out of it.

19:36.622 --> 19:38.845
I learned how to write action sequences.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.869
And all of those are very important to the mystery plot.

19:42.889 --> 19:49.897
When you talk about paying attention to minor characters, that's also the story.

19:50.217 --> 19:54.362
Is this kind of a tip to the reader to be alert?

19:55.000 --> 20:02.107
I think it is a way, it's really about not being a lazy writer.

20:02.127 --> 20:09.695
Not dropping into stereotyping and cartooning the people who pass through your books.

20:09.715 --> 20:16.182
I think John D. MacDonald does a wonderful job of handling minor characters.

20:16.202 --> 20:20.586
So I watch how other writers do things and I learn how I can.

20:20.836 --> 20:24.443
Now, Kinsey is about 33, I guess.

20:24.463 --> 20:25.144
She's 35.

20:25.304 --> 20:25.785
She's 35?

20:25.805 --> 20:30.173
Yeah, she started out 32 when the books first came out in 1982.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.201
Books are sequential, so in her life, three years have passed.

20:34.221 --> 20:37.206
In our lives, 13 have gone by.

20:37.287 --> 20:43.418
When I get to the end of the alphabet, she will turn 40, because she's going to age one year for every two and a half books.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.643
But life begins at 40 for a lot of people.

20:46.004 --> 20:48.448
I know, but she gets to do that in privacy.

20:48.468 --> 20:48.969
Thank you.

20:49.530 --> 20:52.735
Do you suspect that you'll retire her at the age of 40?

20:53.397 --> 20:55.160
I don't know.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.442
She had 14 books.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.545
I'm going to give her the last book.

20:58.565 --> 21:00.469
She gets to do it anything she wants.

21:00.589 --> 21:02.031
It may not even be a mystery.

21:02.272 --> 21:03.113
I don't know what she'll do.

21:03.294 --> 21:03.955
It's a gift.

21:04.295 --> 21:04.816
Yeah, it is.

21:04.957 --> 21:07.441
And it's not mine to determine.

21:07.481 --> 21:09.304
It's a gift from you to kids.

21:09.487 --> 21:20.181
One of the things I've been saying, you know, the woman has taken over my life, and so maybe by the end there will be no Sue Grafton, there will only be Kenzie Milhom.

21:20.621 --> 21:23.765
Because everything I do pertains to her practically.

21:24.766 --> 21:28.551
Is she somebody you'd like to be?

21:28.571 --> 21:30.413
She is a lot of who I am.

21:31.395 --> 21:37.182
The difference is her life is full of genuine adventure.

21:38.056 --> 21:40.161
Mine is full of hard work.

21:41.484 --> 21:49.804
And so the parallels between us are very peculiar because she lives in a very spartan style, a nearly monastic life.

21:50.307 --> 21:53.632
I live very lavishly, thank you, because of her.

21:53.652 --> 21:59.199
So I can say sometimes the smartest thing I ever did was to invent somebody who now supports me.

22:01.503 --> 22:06.570
You know, imagine an imaginary friend who turns out to be your benefactor.

22:06.590 --> 22:07.050
That's it.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.033
I mean, how you can see close and tight.

22:09.073 --> 22:12.578
Yes.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.302
She's an evolving character.

22:15.755 --> 22:17.957
But slowly, I think, as we own.

22:18.077 --> 22:20.700
Which is wonderful because you learn new things about her.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.141
There are textures to her.

22:22.161 --> 22:25.785
She's not pure and perfect in every way.

22:25.985 --> 22:27.026
Oh, God forbid.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.268
I really work to keep her human size.

22:29.728 --> 22:31.570
I don't want her to be larger than life.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.553
I don't want her to be idealized.

22:34.573 --> 22:37.796
And so I like her to be cranky and inconsistent.

22:37.916 --> 22:42.781
And sometimes she has miserable little thoughts, you know.

22:42.901 --> 22:44.783
She can be like we all do.

22:45.151 --> 22:47.996
little petty hatefulness.

22:48.497 --> 22:53.625
I do admire her lying ability, and I do feel I am a quite accomplished liar myself.

22:53.645 --> 22:59.976
Now, this raises something, and whether or not you want to get into it or not, but how do you see this O.J.

23:00.016 --> 23:02.841
Simpson thing affecting your profession?

23:03.141 --> 23:05.826
Because it seems to me that if this guy beats it,

23:06.548 --> 23:07.209
Oh, he will.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.010
And he will.

23:08.671 --> 23:12.876
I'm not asking you for your opinion on it, but anybody did it, obviously.

23:12.896 --> 23:15.840
And if you watch from it, and we've seen it, what does this say?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.002
Oh, here's what's always been true.

23:18.483 --> 23:25.011
There is a huge difference between real homicide and fictional homicide, and this is why people read mystery novels.

23:25.492 --> 23:32.961
In the real world, homicide is, I think the percentage is 65% of all homicides are alcohol-related.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.703
They're generally poorly planned.

23:35.743 --> 23:36.724
They're hasty.

23:37.004 --> 23:38.166
They're impulsive.

23:38.186 --> 23:39.347
And they're pointless.

23:39.407 --> 23:42.791
People kill each other for a pair of tennis shoes.

23:42.851 --> 23:52.682
In fiction, the conceit is that if you are murdered, it is the result of somebody's solid motivation and quite cluttered planning.

23:53.342 --> 24:00.130
If you're murdered in a piece of fiction, somebody's worked at it and has tried to be intelligent and clever about it.

24:00.650 --> 24:13.528
And the other conceit is that if you are murdered in a work of fiction, there is a representative of the law, a detective or a cop who will move heaven and earth to see the justice and stuff.

24:14.589 --> 24:18.114
Pick up the paper and there's no sign of any of that.

24:18.134 --> 24:29.830
In the real world, homicide is pointless, life has little value, and the legal system is pottering and foundering

24:30.181 --> 24:41.155
And we can't look anymore to the courts for a sense of justice and mercy because what we see is killers who are set free six months later.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.237
Have you watched any of this?

24:43.257 --> 24:43.798
Some of it.

24:43.938 --> 24:47.142
I'm really worried I'll get hopelessly addicted.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.764
It's gotten so boring.

24:48.784 --> 24:49.605
Yeah, true.

24:49.946 --> 24:57.075
And the fact that they've allowed this fight.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.698
I've covered a lot of trials as a reporter before I was in.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.611
Yeah.

25:01.712 --> 25:06.796
And I've always said that I would never second this jury because they've seen all the evidence.

25:06.816 --> 25:07.937
That's not the case here.

25:08.037 --> 25:10.560
The whole world has seen more evidence than the children.

25:10.580 --> 25:11.240
Well, they know about it.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.441
Well, that's often true.

25:12.501 --> 25:14.723
There are many things that are not admissible.

25:15.164 --> 25:16.605
Yeah, but it's never on television.

25:16.685 --> 25:16.985
I know.

25:17.005 --> 25:18.146
Gavel-to-gavel coverage.

25:18.267 --> 25:18.687
I know.

25:19.067 --> 25:19.708
It is.

25:20.288 --> 25:22.170
And we've seen the graphic stuff.

25:22.330 --> 25:23.531
Yeah.

25:23.551 --> 25:26.234
But I used to think it would be a hung jury.

25:26.254 --> 25:28.416
Now I think he'll be a critic.

25:28.556 --> 25:28.656
Yeah.

25:28.822 --> 25:34.609
Like it or not, Johnny Cochran has done a fine job of muddying the waters.

25:34.629 --> 25:43.840
Absolutely, histrionics, hysteria, finger-pointing, and all he has to do is create these.

25:43.880 --> 25:57.777
He's done it six different ways, and it's bullshit, but every time you hear about them taking notes, whatever's going down, and it's always about something that would appear to exonerate O.J.

25:57.838 --> 25:58.238
Simpson.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.414
I did an interview with Donald Westlake a couple months back.

26:01.434 --> 26:01.754
Ah, he's a doll.

26:01.774 --> 26:02.315
He's a doll.

26:02.395 --> 26:08.404
And this was, he was so funny, and this was, you know, a lot of things taken off, and I said, well, what do you think?

26:08.424 --> 26:11.388
He said, well, a lot of writing, and he says, I never would have left a glove.

26:12.810 --> 26:13.931
I know.

26:14.132 --> 26:15.754
That made it too easy.

26:15.774 --> 26:16.234
Really?

26:16.254 --> 26:18.858
But who would have thought?

26:18.878 --> 26:24.546
Well, see, if I had done the research, if I had thought of this idea, and had

26:25.117 --> 26:33.985
given it any weight, whatever, and I thought to myself, I'd better go down and talk to the Los Angeles police about whether this would be possible, evidence handled badly.

26:34.546 --> 26:46.097
I know I would have walked in there, they would have assured me that their technicians were impeccably prepared, that the gloves were changed 16 times, that every piece of evidence was long, because that's by the book.

26:47.098 --> 26:49.280
I couldn't believe that.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.221
In a case like this.

26:50.261 --> 26:53.444
I couldn't, they must have known from the outset.

26:54.164 --> 26:55.005
Except that I don't,

26:56.099 --> 26:59.303
Do you think it's relevant to what they... No, no.

26:59.423 --> 27:00.785
I mean, to me, absolutely.

27:01.406 --> 27:04.850
It's rare and... I know, end of story from our perspective.

27:04.890 --> 27:12.159
I call it the Tinkerbell theory, you know, that sort of the pixie fool around and did all this stuff in 20 minutes.

27:13.020 --> 27:23.052
I was just wondering how this effect, it's relevant to this, possibly relevant to this piece, if this trial, this

27:23.622 --> 27:29.910
affects what you... Well, if you had... Because you said, you know, murder is the ultimate evil.

27:29.930 --> 27:30.851
It is, it is.

27:31.031 --> 27:36.277
And if you put this in between the pages of the book, you can have sold two copies.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.460
Especially the tapes.

27:38.680 --> 27:42.445
Oh, spare us the unbelievability of that.

27:43.105 --> 27:50.114
So, I mean, anybody... I know, swear you hadn't said something in ten years, knowing those tapes were sitting out there.

27:50.134 --> 27:51.115
Well... Anyway.

27:51.635 --> 27:53.558
What's your schedule, by the way?

27:53.578 --> 27:56.502
I'm going to go over to Kate's mystery books about five.

27:56.622 --> 27:58.344
Okay, so we'll get some time.

27:58.365 --> 28:01.549
Yeah, we're fine.

28:01.569 --> 28:03.992
I did an interview also with several of these with P.D.

28:04.093 --> 28:06.115
James.

28:06.135 --> 28:06.917
She's a doctor.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.479
She's wonderful.

28:08.499 --> 28:11.703
Of course, I was new to reading these books.

28:11.743 --> 28:14.868
And I said, why does it always have to be there?

28:14.988 --> 28:15.969
I mean, P.I.

28:15.989 --> 28:18.152
P.I.s investigate thousands of them.

28:18.293 --> 28:18.553
Right.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.254
And her answer was, nobody's interested in each day of Granny's Pearls.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.982
Well, I used to say that, because people would ask me, can you have a murder mystery with no murder?

28:28.002 --> 28:28.803
Absolutely not.

28:28.883 --> 28:30.125
Well, a mystery with no murder.

28:30.145 --> 28:35.212
Yeah, but in a way, Lawless is not a murder mystery at all.

28:35.232 --> 28:36.133
It's like a caper.

28:36.153 --> 28:37.715
It's like a zany adventure.

28:38.536 --> 28:42.221
And I think because of Kinsey Millhunt, I can get away with that.

28:42.422 --> 28:43.744
But the stakes have to be high.

28:43.944 --> 28:44.625
Absolutely.

28:45.085 --> 28:46.988
Absolutely.

28:47.407 --> 28:49.169
Okay, let me just see now.

28:49.489 --> 28:50.411
How are we doing?

28:50.431 --> 28:51.452
Are we covering your stuff?

28:51.632 --> 28:53.254
Yeah, I'm happy.

28:53.434 --> 28:55.617
Russ McDonald was, it's a nudge.

28:55.857 --> 28:58.400
Santa Teresa was kind of the tip of the hat.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.342
Yeah, exactly.

29:01.183 --> 29:07.111
I got to meet him a couple of times in the 70s, just in passing, and he was always such a quiet man.

29:07.151 --> 29:15.100
Apparently, you know, he died of Alzheimer's, and apparently it took about three years before Margaret Millar figured out if there was anything wrong, because he was always quiet.

29:15.801 --> 29:16.722
But...

29:17.090 --> 29:19.353
Anyway, he was one of those writers.

29:19.374 --> 29:33.135
It was kind of hard to meet him because Lou Archer was so kind of tough and out there, and Ken McGuire was so recessive and shy, and when his books would come out, he would leave town.

29:33.155 --> 29:36.219
He didn't want to be part of any of the fanfare.

29:36.239 --> 29:40.566
So once you met him, you would read Lou Archer, and you would go, what is the connection?

29:41.423 --> 29:52.640
One of the advantages I have with these books is I am Kinsey Milhoun, and people are very clear in making the association between my personality and hers.

29:53.401 --> 29:58.489
So like if people in my signing lines talk about the film rights, they always think I should play her.

29:59.110 --> 30:01.033
I'm not an actress, I'm so old.

30:01.674 --> 30:05.980
Kinsey Milhoun is always going to be younger and braver and thinner than I am.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.726
I know Bob Parker's Spencer kind of grows with him.

30:09.892 --> 30:14.016
It was interesting, which is one way to do it.

30:14.897 --> 30:19.561
Of course, Philip Marlowe never aged, right?

30:19.581 --> 30:23.305
Well, I think a little bit of aging makes a certain amount of sense.

30:24.226 --> 30:39.561
When I started the series, I wasn't sure what I would do with the aging issue, and I just didn't want Kinsey Milholm to end up being ludicrous, you know, 70 years old with an ear horn and a little

30:39.929 --> 30:44.173
pistol in her pocketbook, you know, swinging it.

30:44.393 --> 30:46.055
This has to be measured.

30:46.395 --> 30:48.517
That's right.

30:48.657 --> 30:50.819
I've got to stretch this out.

30:50.859 --> 30:54.963
I always say I'm going to be 108 myself by when we get to the end.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.765
But do you feel the pressure?

30:56.785 --> 31:02.170
I mean, because you have committed yourself to getting one of these guys out.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.792
The pressure is sometimes almost crushing.

31:04.892 --> 31:07.995
So a lot of what I do is

31:08.515 --> 31:10.297
I've talked myself out of that.

31:10.658 --> 31:13.802
And it's connected to the whole issue of reviews.

31:13.922 --> 31:21.111
Again, it's like when you do a piece of work, it is just you and the work.

31:21.131 --> 31:29.261
How it's going to be received, how many copies you're going to sell, whether the critics are going to love it or hate it is not your business.

31:29.281 --> 31:33.026
So you have to stay very pure in your intention.

31:33.046 --> 31:35.569
And the risk is enormous.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.647
for the second book and the third and the fourth.

31:38.688 --> 31:43.641
And it gets... Especially if now the first printing is $750,000.

31:43.661 --> 31:43.761
Yeah.

31:43.781 --> 31:46.308
In fact, I just heard they went back for another $50,000.

31:46.428 --> 31:50.419
I mean...

31:50.872 --> 31:53.055
Some of the things I read when you had 100,000.

31:53.756 --> 31:57.662
I got 34,000 of my book and print.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.425
Listen, that's fabulous.

31:59.465 --> 32:01.368
That's fabulous.

32:01.388 --> 32:02.209
I'm pretty excited.

32:02.710 --> 32:04.012
I think I would be.

32:04.733 --> 32:09.400
My first print was 6,500 copies.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.204
I know, they are.

32:12.244 --> 32:15.529
They're selling from 9 to 1100 books a week.

32:15.549 --> 32:16.911
Yeah, except I don't get the money.

32:17.171 --> 32:19.815
No, of course not.

32:21.044 --> 32:29.414
When you start, do you pretty much have an idea?

32:29.434 --> 32:33.819
No, they told you in Hollywood that you couldn't write until the rap on you was that.

32:33.839 --> 32:36.823
Yeah, there's some critics who still claim I can't just plot.

32:36.843 --> 32:37.323
Is that right?

32:37.483 --> 32:38.925
But that's okay.

32:38.945 --> 32:39.926
That's okay.

32:39.946 --> 32:41.068
Who cares?

32:41.088 --> 32:43.190
But do we start with plot?

32:43.470 --> 32:44.432
Here's what I do.

32:44.712 --> 32:48.216
I do a journal on my word processor.

32:48.787 --> 32:54.395
in which I talk about, it's like a long letter to myself about what I'm doing.

32:55.416 --> 33:02.246
And so I log in, and I generally talk about, sometimes I add a line about, is it raining?

33:02.486 --> 33:03.527
Do I have a migraine?

33:03.567 --> 33:04.469
Is my cat sick?

33:05.029 --> 33:07.373
Because I think that affects your work, you know?

33:08.755 --> 33:11.118
If your spouse is ill, it affects your work.

33:11.779 --> 33:17.106
Then I talk about, that's just one line, I'm not in the business of keeping an endless diary of my growing life.

33:17.761 --> 33:31.339
Then I talk about everything I know about a book, and I play suppose and what if, and I have a lot of big charts because I keep track of whether the killer is male, female.

33:32.360 --> 33:37.968
I keep track of how Kinsey is hired, what she's hired to do and who hires her.

33:37.988 --> 33:45.017
I keep track of what the motive for the crime is so that I don't just do endless repetitions of the same thing.

33:45.233 --> 33:54.705
And I also keep a list of the climaxes of the book so I don't get into unconscious repetition.

33:54.725 --> 33:57.768
I don't want the reader to go, oh boy, here comes the car chase.

33:57.788 --> 34:00.231
Oh man, here's the obligatory, you know.

34:00.311 --> 34:01.713
But it is a genre of books.

34:01.733 --> 34:02.294
It is.

34:02.454 --> 34:03.435
And you accept that.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.438
Yeah, and... That doesn't bother you.

34:05.458 --> 34:06.399
No, I love that.

34:06.539 --> 34:10.764
I equate it to playing a hand of bridge.

34:10.784 --> 34:14.008
You always got 13 cards, but the beauty of the game is

34:14.292 --> 34:15.894
It can be anything.

34:16.234 --> 34:24.925
And even if you have a bad hand, the ingenuity it takes to play it well will still teach you something.

34:24.945 --> 34:30.131
I've read also that you really believe a great deal in intuition and intuitive process.

34:30.271 --> 34:30.852
Yeah.

34:31.152 --> 34:40.283
Where the work is concerned, and when I get really connected to a book, there is, I call it my shadow side anymore.

34:40.550 --> 34:45.899
The object of the exercise, as far as I'm concerned, is to let Shadow write the book.

34:45.919 --> 34:55.716
Because ego is the one that says, I hope this sentence is literary enough, I hope this is especially poetic, but not that, you know?

34:56.077 --> 34:59.783
You need to come from someplace much more primitive.

34:59.803 --> 35:03.790
An old ego's dreading imposter will just get you into big trouble.

35:04.883 --> 35:09.549
And the stories are, although you do have these detailed journals, which I guess are four times the way.

35:09.589 --> 35:10.270
And boring.

35:10.591 --> 35:12.393
Oh, it's my whining on paper, yeah.

35:12.413 --> 35:15.337
But do you ever find that the novels kind of go where it wants to go?

35:15.357 --> 35:15.777
Yeah, yeah.

35:16.298 --> 35:17.319
And that's wonderful.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.143
Yeah, I don't feel that's... That's good.

35:20.183 --> 35:22.466
The surprises are fabulous.

35:22.486 --> 35:24.529
When I did J is for Judgment,

35:24.982 --> 35:29.308
That was almost truly a completely shadow written book.

35:30.250 --> 35:39.664
And what happened was, you know, when you write mysteries, one of the rules, you should pardon the expression, is you have to put the body as close to the front end of the book as possible.

35:40.024 --> 35:41.226
I've never believed that.

35:41.406 --> 35:45.252
I've seen more books badly written on that premise.

35:45.518 --> 35:52.748
So I'm watching the body in this book, and it's drifting toward the back, and I'm starting to laugh because in J.S.

35:52.828 --> 35:57.074
for Judgment, you don't know for sure there's been a murder until the epilogue.

35:57.094 --> 35:58.235
Well, I got tickled by that.

35:58.275 --> 36:01.660
I got scared, too, because ego's saying, you mustn't do that.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.704
That's against the rules, and we're going to get criticized for that.

36:04.724 --> 36:06.166
Oh, were you criticized for it?

36:06.566 --> 36:10.552
No, they never catch you for the shit you think they're going to catch you for.

36:10.612 --> 36:12.775
It's always something else entirely.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.597
So everything you've said about it.

36:14.746 --> 36:24.501
The last thing in there, I was discovering this with a nonfiction book, but I had some things in there that were read by my lawyers, and that we were waiting at a peak.

36:24.841 --> 36:28.527
But I do get these little snipes, you know.

36:29.468 --> 36:32.953
I can't believe some of the things that I picked up on.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.976
I'm delighted that people are reading it.

36:35.116 --> 36:41.286
It's the whole gotcha mentality, the letters that go, gotcha, you made a boo-boo on page 46.

36:41.526 --> 36:44.230
I mean, I thought, you know, they're so good.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.852
prudish about these things.

36:47.192 --> 36:48.454
We've talked about the movies.

36:48.474 --> 36:49.575
We've talked about your father.

36:50.316 --> 36:56.643
You have also quoted once as saying that you think that people were perfectly happy childhoods.

36:56.783 --> 37:01.789
Yeah, the quote, and to me it always has to go a certain way.

37:01.809 --> 37:08.296
The quote is, what seems true to me is no one with a happy childhood ever amounts to much in this world.

37:08.876 --> 37:11.159
And you think about it.

37:11.179 --> 37:14.723
All the people who do things are driven from something.

37:15.023 --> 37:15.704
dark.

37:16.685 --> 37:20.571
The people who are raised in happy households are so bland.

37:21.212 --> 37:26.579
They never, you know, they live in a state of equilibrium, so why do they need to do anything?

37:26.600 --> 37:33.890
Those of us who came out of dysfunctional families, we're always groping and stumbling and compensating and overachieving.

37:34.050 --> 37:37.275
But I respect the fact that you don't make a big deal out of this either.

37:37.295 --> 37:37.555
No.

37:38.396 --> 37:40.980
You don't whine about... No, no, no, because...

37:41.146 --> 37:46.674
What was perfect about my childhood was it's perfect training for a writer.

37:46.694 --> 37:56.287
And my parents were educated, intelligent, articulate people who adored books and reading, and they gave me many, wonderful things.

37:56.848 --> 38:01.735
They just happened to drink, and that got everybody in a lot of trouble.

38:02.616 --> 38:06.141
But even that was a gift to me.

38:06.543 --> 38:19.340
And the truth is, the minute you discover what's true about your life, you know, we grow up, we don't want to get it, you know, we think every family is weird or whatever we experience we think is normal.

38:19.881 --> 38:24.587
The minute you understand, you are being responsible for what goes down.

38:25.188 --> 38:34.120
So the minute I got it that my parents were alcoholics and had problems, then it became my responsibility to make sure I was okay.

38:34.893 --> 38:37.456
So I can't blame them for that.

38:37.496 --> 38:45.526
What I really respect about these books, and my guess would be that you probably have just as many male readers as you have.

38:45.626 --> 38:47.569
Yeah, the shift is happening.

38:47.589 --> 38:47.869
Is it?

38:48.850 --> 39:01.706
And I think one of the reasons is that it would be so easy, especially since you're a pioneer in this field, to allow your character to be a political kind of a character, to champion whatever causes are out there.

39:02.628 --> 39:04.630
A lot of people thought,

39:04.846 --> 39:10.531
I mean, you could certainly strengthen a constituency, but I don't think you're writing for a constituency.

39:10.551 --> 39:12.893
No, and I hate politics.

39:12.973 --> 39:13.994
I hate propaganda.

39:14.014 --> 39:15.336
I think it falsifies.

39:15.456 --> 39:20.140
I would never alter a story to make a political point.

39:20.681 --> 39:22.622
I don't have political points of view.

39:22.742 --> 39:24.444
I mean, by nature, I do.

39:24.524 --> 39:27.887
I am a strong person, and as I said, I believe in hard work.

39:28.027 --> 39:33.132
I believe you go as far as you can with whatever ability you're born with, but...

39:34.546 --> 39:37.809
I was one of the reasons I never joined Sisters in Crime.

39:37.829 --> 39:46.196
There was huge pressure on a lot of this in those days when that organization was formed because it was, if you're not for us, you must be against us.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.660
You know, the whole queen bee, oh, you think you're too good to help us out.

39:50.260 --> 39:54.464
And what I kept saying was writing is not about gender.

39:54.484 --> 40:02.511
And I think it's a mistake to, if the guys, if male writers had decided to band together to form Brothers in Crime,

40:02.795 --> 40:05.859
The hue and pride that would have gone up would be appalling.

40:05.980 --> 40:09.885
And I kept thinking, why is it okay for us, but it's not okay for them?

40:09.905 --> 40:11.147
Good.

40:11.167 --> 40:12.429
Very good.

40:14.111 --> 40:18.999
You said that you would never allow Hollywood to... No.

40:19.279 --> 40:21.202
But do you have a visual image of her?

40:21.222 --> 40:23.385
I mean, I mean, you described her physically.

40:23.565 --> 40:26.890
Oh, I think it's probably close to my face.

40:27.090 --> 40:31.637
And see, the voice, I think, is mine, which is why I listen to the audio tapes.

40:32.073 --> 40:55.853
many people think of her as judy k because of that audio tapes but it's not that i know kinsey is not southern but i think she just sounds like me but she sounds like that voice in my head you know the one that tells you what's going on well i don't know i look for her sometimes around santa teresa do you consider yourself a storyteller in a manner

40:57.267 --> 41:00.211
Are you telling stories as story?

41:00.231 --> 41:01.393
How important is story?

41:01.413 --> 41:06.020
Yeah, I do tell stories, but I don't think of myself as a storyteller.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.704
That's a very odd thing, now that I think about it.

41:10.126 --> 41:12.549
Could you explain just a bit?

41:12.569 --> 41:12.730
Yeah.

41:13.411 --> 41:14.993
Well, you certainly are telling a story.

41:15.093 --> 41:20.201
I am, and I think storytelling is very important, and I think I'm learning how to do that.

41:20.361 --> 41:24.407
But I don't think of myself as a storyteller by nature.

41:24.427 --> 41:26.650
I don't know what I think of myself as.

41:27.254 --> 41:28.616
That's a curious thing.

41:28.857 --> 41:30.299
Nobody ever asked me that before.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.723
Well, you can think about it for the next time.

41:33.665 --> 41:39.555
If you have to be someplace in 10 minutes, we should probably wander back down there.

41:39.655 --> 41:42.760
Well, just make sure you're covered.

41:43.161 --> 41:45.485
A lot of good stuff.

41:45.905 --> 41:49.031
You write nice stocky stuff.

41:49.051 --> 41:52.857
I like that line, lie at the drop of the hat.

41:53.731 --> 41:59.136
But of course, when we talk about lying, you think of Detective Furman's lies.

42:00.478 --> 42:01.619
Unbelievable.

42:01.879 --> 42:02.660
But he's on tape.

42:03.381 --> 42:07.385
We never said he was smart.

42:07.885 --> 42:18.756
Did you describe this for me?

42:18.956 --> 42:19.577
Is it fun?

42:20.898 --> 42:22.860
Do you have fun with this?

42:23.363 --> 42:30.893
L was fun, but because I took the pressure off.

42:30.913 --> 42:33.116
You know, I told, hold on, I'm going to do a book a year.

42:33.757 --> 42:38.083
And now I wrote this book, I'm like, oh, I remember how it's supposed to feel.

42:38.103 --> 42:39.144
It's supposed to be fun.

42:39.625 --> 42:42.549
You know, I remember fun, P-H-U-N, fun.

42:46.654 --> 42:48.257
And this is September 8th.

42:49.058 --> 42:49.698
Sandwich, too.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.083
All right, absolutely.

42:53.468 --> 42:59.455
Oh, I got my Ellis for Lawless sweatshirt in the area.

42:59.475 --> 43:00.676
Oh, you did?

43:01.697 --> 43:03.960
My older daughter has appropriated it for me, though.

43:05.141 --> 43:05.461
Of course.

43:05.481 --> 43:06.583
They're beautiful, they're huge.

43:07.163 --> 43:10.547
Oh, you know what you should do is give me, is your home address on here?

43:10.567 --> 43:11.008
Yes, it is.

43:11.068 --> 43:13.150
Okay, because I'll put you on my mailing list.

43:13.170 --> 43:13.510
Oh, please.

43:13.530 --> 43:17.395
Then you'll get, like, your Ellis for Lawless luggage tag.

43:17.535 --> 43:18.476
Oh, I would love that.

43:18.496 --> 43:20.438
Okay, I'll make a little note.

43:20.705 --> 43:23.788
And you get a Kinsey-Mohan Christmas card.

43:24.148 --> 43:24.549
Great.

43:24.569 --> 43:27.412
And I'll certainly make sure you get cheer sheets.

43:27.872 --> 43:28.153
Okay.

43:28.253 --> 43:29.354
Ooh, that'd be good.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.896
And a little bit publicist.

43:32.477 --> 43:34.359
Oh.

43:34.379 --> 43:34.679
All right.

43:34.699 --> 43:37.041
So you were telling me what your next book's going to be?

43:37.082 --> 43:38.883
Well, let's say, what's the next one?

43:39.003 --> 43:40.004
I want to know.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.246
I love it now.

43:41.266 --> 43:45.150
Both are saying, I would love to see a proposal for the next book.

43:45.170 --> 43:47.272
Is that wonderful?

43:47.532 --> 43:50.355
Yeah.

43:50.375 --> 43:50.475
Yeah.

43:51.535 --> 43:53.162
That's great.

43:53.182 --> 43:56.799
I'm going to tell our publicist to send you one.

43:57.100 --> 43:59.250
Okay, ooh, perfect.

44:00.310 --> 44:02.853
They can do that if you'd like to see it.

44:03.074 --> 44:05.997
If you're interested, Dave Karpolis.

44:06.738 --> 44:08.781
I would love that.

44:08.981 --> 44:09.582
He really is.

44:10.163 --> 44:14.849
He's very obsessed.

44:16.090 --> 44:24.681
He's the largest.

44:26.872 --> 44:31.656
a property owner of Santa Barbara County.

44:32.397 --> 44:34.439
What he saw, he was a school teacher.

44:34.459 --> 44:37.421
He taught mathematics in high school.

44:37.441 --> 44:42.866
And what he saw was a need for a single family housing.

44:42.886 --> 44:45.868
And he bought up, started buying houses for a baby.

44:46.709 --> 44:50.372
They bought one, and they rented them.

44:50.593 --> 44:54.276
And he's a mathematician, and he figured things out.

44:54.296 --> 44:55.697
And to the point that

44:56.082 --> 44:59.166
and it's basically low income.

44:59.967 --> 45:05.876
I mean, if you know somebody at the Santa Barbara paper, you might just pull the clips on if you're interested.

45:06.336 --> 45:06.677
Yeah.

45:06.697 --> 45:14.127
I never use, I mean, he rents to large Hispanic families, eight million papers.

45:14.327 --> 45:25.583
Well, it's been charged, you know, but my sense is that, you know, a guy that always, you know, these places are up to close,

45:26.052 --> 45:26.933
Yeah.

45:26.973 --> 45:32.683
We were always going to have complaints.

45:33.103 --> 45:34.125
Yeah.

45:34.205 --> 45:38.171
Oh, we ought to see it.

45:38.191 --> 45:39.874
Have you ever seen this?

45:39.894 --> 45:43.259
This collection has an image.

45:43.279 --> 45:44.802
It's one of the images.

45:44.822 --> 45:46.204
It's a lot of collection of images.

45:46.184 --> 45:49.830
Do you know this?

45:49.850 --> 45:50.531
No.

45:50.832 --> 45:56.081
I know, I know about the manuscript.

45:58.325 --> 45:59.146
What?

45:59.567 --> 46:07.821
What?

46:07.801 --> 46:22.823
Thank you.

46:22.803 --> 46:34.990
I have a few of my cars here.

46:35.010 --> 46:40.562
Do you want me to go around and drive you?

46:40.582 --> 46:41.164
No, no, it's on the way back.

46:41.184 --> 46:41.284
Okay.

46:41.264 --> 47:02.678
Thank you.

47:02.698 --> 47:03.860
Thank you.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.803
Thank you.

47:05.783 --> 47:18.159
Okay, you're all set.

47:18.180 --> 47:20.523
Look at that oldie.

47:20.543 --> 47:20.963
Oh, that's very good.

47:20.983 --> 47:22.505
This is Carol.

47:22.525 --> 47:22.686
I don't.

47:22.706 --> 47:22.866
I don't.

47:22.886 --> 47:23.507
Carol, nice to meet you.

47:23.527 --> 47:23.967
We'll get a good time.

47:23.987 --> 47:24.167
Oh, good.

47:24.188 --> 47:25.289
I've got the energy out of him, so now I'm awake again.

47:25.309 --> 47:25.569
Stay in here.

47:25.589 --> 47:25.850
Stay in here.

47:25.870 --> 47:26.070
Thank you.

47:47.903 --> 47:50.387
The End

48:20.557 --> 48:36.068
Oh, my God.

48:52.214 --> 49:19.236
I'm gonna hold you in my arms, just you and I. Oh, yeah, in the middle of the night.

49:19.256 --> 49:19.997
Oh, baby, in the middle of the night.

49:20.017 --> 49:20.398
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

49:25.542 --> 49:43.213
Oh, oh, oh.

49:47.480 --> 50:11.310
Oh, yeah.

50:16.218 --> 50:38.732
I don't know.

50:41.480 --> 50:49.994
I don't know.

50:50.014 --> 50:50.275
I don't know.

50:55.773 --> 51:24.632
Get on up, get on up, get on up

51:24.612 --> 51:42.790
ladies and gentlemen we're pleased to bring you another hour packed with the greatest songs ever made on oldies

51:45.301 --> 52:09.823
What have you been doing on the side of the wall?

52:09.803 --> 52:28.390
Oh, oh, oh, I love you.

52:28.411 --> 52:28.871
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

52:28.891 --> 52:29.432
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

52:29.412 --> 52:44.485
Oh.

52:44.465 --> 52:59.407
.

52:59.427 --> 52:59.447
.

52:59.467 --> 52:59.487
.

52:59.467 --> 53:27.908
.

53:27.928 --> 53:27.948
.

53:27.968 --> 53:27.988
.

53:38.650 --> 54:08.657
Thank you.

54:08.637 --> 54:30.490
Don't believe it.

54:30.510 --> 54:30.850
Don't believe it.

54:30.870 --> 54:31.211
Don't believe it.

54:31.231 --> 54:31.571
Don't believe it.

54:31.591 --> 54:31.932
Don't believe it.

54:31.952 --> 54:32.292
Don't believe it.

54:32.313 --> 54:32.653
Don't believe it.

54:32.633 --> 54:40.349
I got the money, I got the money.

54:41.231 --> 54:44.237
I got the money.

54:44.257 --> 54:44.698
I got the money.

54:47.063 --> 54:51.392
I got the money.

54:51.993 --> 54:53.376
I got the money.

54:53.356 --> 55:04.393
And I can meet them all together, but he's all I have to love them.

55:04.413 --> 55:05.775
My star, I'm in the shape of a man.

55:05.795 --> 55:08.299
Here we'll never talk to you, but I ain't got no body.

55:08.319 --> 55:10.523
I got some money, but I've got to pay.

55:10.543 --> 55:18.435
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why,

55:18.415 --> 55:27.612
Another fella told me, we had a sister, we lived just fine.

55:27.632 --> 55:31.660
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a stranger's number.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.403
But I've got no one inside here.

55:34.008 --> 55:35.209
Street's causing delays.

55:35.229 --> 55:37.431
Congress Street now almost across the river.

55:37.451 --> 55:42.557
As far as the major roadways go, let's check in now with Malcolm Alter with an update on downtown from the BZ Copter.

55:42.777 --> 55:43.177
Malcolm?

55:43.397 --> 55:47.221
All right, Alan, both lines of the artery remain jammed along with the entrance of the Callahan Tunnel.

55:47.241 --> 55:52.146
The subway is eased out, so is the lower deck of Route 93, just slowing down mostly around Community College.

55:52.466 --> 55:54.509
The Callahan is plugged up in the entrance right now.

55:54.529 --> 55:56.551
Storer Drive is back into the Storer Tunnel.

55:56.571 --> 55:59.273
Land Boulevard most of the way back to the Longfellow Bridge.

55:59.293 --> 56:03.738
Cambridge Street is very badly jammed up, coming out of Charles Circle, heading up to Government Senate.

56:03.758 --> 56:03.998
You want to

56:03.978 --> 56:05.341
What does it all cost?

56:05.361 --> 56:07.226
Southbury Street is closed off right now.

56:07.246 --> 56:09.772
It looks like traffic still is flowing through Congress Street.

56:09.793 --> 56:12.038
If they shut it down, they have reopened it again.

56:12.078 --> 56:14.284
That doesn't mean they're not going to shut it down again.

56:14.304 --> 56:17.572
So just be prepared to avoid that entire area if you possibly can.

56:18.033 --> 56:19.236
Malcolm Alter, the BZ Copter.

56:19.216 --> 56:20.038
Thank you, Malcolm.

56:20.058 --> 56:25.609
Southbound Expressway, slow all the way down to Braintree, Route 3 southbound, jammed up all the way to Route 18 in Weymouth.

56:25.649 --> 56:34.828
Stay to the left to get by a serious accident there, 128 southbound, heavy through Wellesley, all the way down through 95 in Canton, very little running room there, northbound Route 3 to 93.

56:34.808 --> 56:42.817
And Route 3 itself all jammed up from 62 to 495, and the bike westbound stop and go flying from Alston Brighton right out to the TV Tower due to an earlier car fire.

56:43.158 --> 56:46.342
Aaron Sawyer, WBZ, 24-hour traffic network.

56:46.362 --> 56:51.147
This is BMW Dealers, where you'll find the exciting new BMW 318 Ti.

56:51.708 --> 56:55.653

56:55.853 --> 57:00.158
Test drive the new 318 Ti at your mass BMW dealer today.

57:01.606 --> 57:06.931
Only 10 seconds till closing time.

57:07.012 --> 57:11.436
Dominating this shopping truck.

57:11.556 --> 57:15.901
He's got two AT&T digital answering machines.

57:15.921 --> 57:17.002
Whoa, now he's going for the cartel.

57:17.102 --> 57:18.683
Get the slam done deal.

His wallet is out.

57:31.897 --> 57:44.473
Get the phone products to help you stay on top of your game from AT&T.

57:44.493 --> 57:45.794
That's your true choice.

57:45.814 --> 57:49.098
For details, visit participating AT&T Authorized Retailer for AT&T Phone Center.

57:49.118 --> 57:50.120
That's what will offer at AT&T 9995.

57:50.140 --> 57:50.760
Or more supplies at AT&T 10995.

57:50.780 --> 57:50.900
Great.

57:50.921 --> 57:51.241
No purchase yet.

57:51.261 --> 57:51.762
Every down or swoop stay.

60-year-old.

57:52.502 --> 57:52.943
Employment prohibited.

57:52.923 --> 58:02.639
WBCTV's signed now is 5-0-5-6-8-4.

58:02.719 --> 58:06.806
Now on that JFK evacuation in downtown Boston.

58:06.946 --> 58:10.011
According to WBCTV4, the bomb squad is now obscene.

58:10.211 --> 58:18.745
A suspicious package, maybe a briefcase, was found inside the JFK building and the threat of any

58:18.725 --> 58:22.010
Challenge from that briefcase is being taken very serious.

58:22.030 --> 58:25.135
The bomb squad is on the scene of the JFK building in downtown Boston.

58:25.155 --> 58:26.416
It has been evacuated.

58:26.436 --> 58:29.020
The Boston Fire Department and bomb squad are now at the scene.

58:29.040 --> 58:32.465
Converse Street and a few other surrounding areas are closed off to traffic.

58:32.726 --> 58:34.128
Investigators are now at the scene.

58:34.148 --> 58:36.852
We'll update you as soon as we develop more information.

58:37.372 --> 58:40.097
WBZ's Carl Stevens is on his way to the scene.

58:40.117 --> 58:44.465
Bosnian government and Serb officials say they got what they want at talks in Geneva.

58:44.485 --> 58:47.831
International negotiators announced an agreement on principles for peace talks.

58:48.252 --> 58:55.245
The principles call for recognizing Bosnia's international borders, while giving the Serbs a separate and equal entity within the country.

58:55.225 --> 59:04.259
Meanwhile, another mortar exploded in Sarajevo today, injuring 14 people, including some children, and NATO bombers are continuing to hit their Serbian targets.

59:04.279 --> 59:07.324
Lawrence Cobb is a former assistant defense secretary.

59:07.344 --> 59:11.491
He says these attacks should come as no surprise while peace talks continue.

59:12.212 --> 59:17.841
You can expect fighting to erupt in there as soon as the great powers turn away because you

59:18.108 --> 59:25.358
have not solved the basic problem of three separate groups really not wanting to share political power.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.366
Corb is now the Brookings Institute's teacher in Washington.

59:31.386 --> 59:34.590
A higher authority issues an order today for O.J.

59:34.610 --> 59:35.251
Simpson.

59:35.271 --> 59:40.799
In the judge case, a major development of the Simpson trial details now from ABC News.

59:40.859 --> 59:41.820
Here's Larry Jacobs.

59:42.863 --> 59:45.468
Another win for the prosecution of the O.J.

59:45.488 --> 59:46.129
Simpson case.

59:46.229 --> 59:51.418
Judge Edo wanted to tell the jurors that LAPD Detective Mark Furman was unavailable to testify.

59:51.959 --> 59:59.713
Well, they went to an appeals court, which has just ruled that Judge Edo must change the jury instruction or explain himself to a higher court.

59:59.733 --> 01:00:02.758
We're live with ABC News correspondent Greg Jarrett in Los Angeles.

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:04.080
Greg, some background here.

01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:06.745
The judge never had to tell jurors that Furman had pleaded the fifth.

01:00:07.265 --> 01:00:08.307
That's right.

01:00:08.728 --> 01:00:15.482
The defense had wanted him either on the stand to plead the fifth in front of the jury or a jury instruction saying that he had pleaded the fifth.

01:00:15.502 --> 01:00:17.486
Instead, the judge said he's simply unavailable.

01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:18.769
Draw your own conclusions.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:24.801
Well, the appeals court says the California law is specific that you cannot issue a jury instruction

01:00:24.781 --> 01:00:28.607
concerning the Fifth Amendment from which a presumption would arise.

01:00:28.687 --> 01:00:34.656
In other words, the jury can't think that because he claimed the Fifth that he did anything wrong in the past.

01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:36.198
That's plain and simple law.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:41.106
ABC News correspondent Greg Jarrett, live from L.A., Larry Jacobs, ABC News.

01:00:41.126 --> 01:00:45.152
We have more information now on that situation in downtown Boston.
