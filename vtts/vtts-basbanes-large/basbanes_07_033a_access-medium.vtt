WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:06.529
meet, too, with Mr. Wolf in Philadelphia.

00:06.549 --> 00:08.351
We were talking about Edward Newton.

00:08.371 --> 00:10.153
Edward Newton.

00:10.613 --> 00:25.630
There were some people who didn't like him, thought he was a Bulgarian, but he really was a great book publicist, rare book publicist.

00:26.832 --> 00:29.915
And he was a play actor, too.

00:29.995 --> 00:30.696
He wore

00:31.553 --> 00:54.354
black and white check suits and red ties so you couldn't miss them, and acted as though he had lived in London most of his life, quoted Johnson, Dr. Johnson, all the time, and put on a damn good act.

00:56.796 --> 01:00.379
I found him interesting.

01:00.562 --> 01:01.664
I saw his books.

01:02.485 --> 01:11.520
His collection wasn't one of the greatest, but he was interesting, and he was an interesting man.

01:13.002 --> 01:14.344
Did you know Harry Smith?

01:15.226 --> 01:16.368
No, no.

01:16.808 --> 01:17.349
There's another guy.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.772
That's before my time.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.975
That's before my time.

01:21.095 --> 01:23.119
But Newton is kind of before you.

01:23.399 --> 01:27.666
No, I knew him the last years of his life.

01:28.760 --> 01:42.673
He was suffering from a very painful cancer, and he moved out of his big house in Dalesford and took a suite at the Bellevue and was there.

01:42.733 --> 01:47.977
This is, what, in the late 30s, very early 40s.

01:49.399 --> 01:53.442
And I was working at Rosenbach's around the corner here.

01:53.743 --> 01:58.547
He would go in at lunchtime, spend half an hour with him or something.

01:59.573 --> 02:07.501
I couldn't really cheer him up, because all the news from England was bad, and he was feeling the pain.

02:08.102 --> 02:10.564
But I got to know him fairly well.

02:12.106 --> 02:14.768
Did he really know his books?

02:14.789 --> 02:16.410
Well, he knew his own books, yes.

02:17.411 --> 02:29.023
He was not in any sense, and I don't think ever pretended to be, a scholar, which is why some people said he was a Bulgarian.

02:30.522 --> 02:31.884
Yes, he knew his folks.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.347
Who would have called him a Bulgarian?

02:34.908 --> 02:38.392
Oh, the people in town, yes.

02:38.412 --> 02:40.114
But these were local people, isn't it?

02:40.134 --> 02:40.615
Local people.

02:42.217 --> 02:45.481
I have no doubt that people in England, too.

02:47.123 --> 02:52.530
But, I think it was unfair.

02:53.658 --> 02:54.539
Very definitely.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.542
He certainly did a lot for book collecting.

02:56.702 --> 02:58.444
He did a great deal for book collecting.

02:58.464 --> 03:05.073
I can't agree that, you know, so many of his books, he did limitations, you know, sign limited.

03:05.694 --> 03:07.617
Oh, well, but that's... You did that.

03:07.937 --> 03:13.405
And also, while we're talking about Philadelphia book people, I guess we have to mention the Wideners, too.

03:14.146 --> 03:22.397
Yes, well, that... I just knew Joe Widener enough to shake his hand about once or twice.

03:22.417 --> 03:22.517
Yeah.

03:23.189 --> 03:41.934
I brought his copy of the Gutenberg Bible in two volumes from his place in Elkins Park, put it in my car seat next to me for an exhibition at the Free Library.

03:42.395 --> 03:43.636
What was this?

03:43.656 --> 03:49.024
Oh, this was probably in 1940, I would guess.

03:49.364 --> 03:51.086
I would have gone without knowing this story.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.268
That's funny.

03:53.024 --> 03:59.071
Well, there was a kind of... things were easier then.

03:59.212 --> 04:00.834
People didn't worry.

04:01.214 --> 04:03.076
How did you feel driving into town?

04:03.297 --> 04:03.677
I don't know.

04:03.697 --> 04:04.999
Well, you know, I picked up the tube.

04:05.019 --> 04:06.040
I don't put in one seat.

04:07.181 --> 04:10.625
I'd been used to handling pretty good books, you know.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.650
And this is the way they agreed.

04:15.972 --> 04:19.396
Today you'd have to insure the thing for $10 million.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.799
Oh, it would be all racked up and everything.

04:22.235 --> 04:23.497
These weren't wrapped up.

04:24.358 --> 04:26.882
They just gave them to me, and I put them in the car.

04:26.923 --> 04:30.669
Where did, uh, where did their Gutenberg go?

04:30.689 --> 04:31.590
The Widener's?

04:31.610 --> 04:32.612
To Harvard.

04:33.072 --> 04:33.653
Harvard got it.

04:36.879 --> 04:37.039
Oh.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.342
Wasn't that something?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.845
Yeah, yeah.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.169
Well, great stuff.

04:43.389 --> 04:46.294
You mentioned the Harry Widener story in the book, too.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.018
Well, I'm told that story isn't true.

04:49.387 --> 04:50.509
About the Bacon essays?

04:50.850 --> 04:53.334
There's a slightly different thing.

04:53.735 --> 04:55.578
I forget who wrote an article.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.481
It was an article published.

04:57.501 --> 05:01.288
I've seen it in at least three different places, including your book, New England.

05:01.308 --> 05:01.709
Oh, yeah, sure.

05:02.150 --> 05:04.774
But this is a story that was told everywhere.

05:04.854 --> 05:06.437
But it's so wonderful, a story.

05:06.457 --> 05:08.321
It's a good story, and it may have been true.

05:08.481 --> 05:12.508
I think Quaritch did say that he bought us, it was not a first book.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.763
No, it wasn't the first edition, anyway.

05:15.883 --> 05:20.649
And he probably did, so he certainly must have bought a copy of the essays, Bacon's essays.

05:20.669 --> 05:23.413
Whether or not he said, if I'm shipwrecked, it'll go with me.

05:23.813 --> 05:28.279
That's the kind of apocrypha that becomes too charming to describe.

05:28.299 --> 05:32.205
Yeah, but there was something about the whole business.

05:33.486 --> 05:41.517
I remember reading the article and feeling, well, this person went into it in great depth.

05:42.492 --> 05:44.896
And I don't remember what the upshot was.

05:44.916 --> 05:49.102
You know, it's in Harvard University's book on the building of their library, though.

05:49.122 --> 05:49.763
Well, I'm sure.

05:49.823 --> 05:51.626
It was a story that was common.

05:52.247 --> 05:52.347
Yeah.

05:52.367 --> 05:58.216
But, I mean, even in their own publication, The Building of a Library, which Roger Stein gave me.

05:58.497 --> 05:58.917
Yeah.

05:59.077 --> 06:00.600
I've seen it in four places, at least.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.101
Well, I'm sure.

06:01.141 --> 06:02.382
I'm sure.

06:02.423 --> 06:04.045
And it may have been true.

06:04.312 --> 06:04.953
Somebody.

06:04.973 --> 06:05.653
I'm going to use it.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.877
I'll make every effort to disprove it.

06:08.897 --> 06:10.198
Let's put it that way.

06:10.298 --> 06:11.880
No, I don't think so.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.921
It's a delightful story.

06:13.021 --> 06:14.002
It's a great story.

06:15.323 --> 06:22.451
Mark says in Books and Bitters that Had He Lived, Harry Widener would have been the greatest book collector the world has ever known.

06:22.491 --> 06:27.236
That's a little press agentry going on there, don't you think, for the benefit of misunderstanding?

06:27.256 --> 06:33.542
Well, that's considering that many, if not most of the books,

06:34.096 --> 06:44.851
that were bought after his death, because his mother wanted to spend money in his memory, and she was willing to spend anything.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.435
And she did not want her name tied in with it, either.

06:47.455 --> 06:48.256
Tied in with it, no.

06:48.797 --> 06:49.498
This was Harry's collection.

06:49.518 --> 06:52.983
This was Harry's collection, a great collection.

06:53.704 --> 06:53.984
No, it did.

06:54.024 --> 06:54.565
Who knows?

06:54.645 --> 06:56.508
The doctor was the agent for that, too.

06:56.568 --> 06:57.169
Who knows?

06:57.790 --> 06:58.631
It's a great story.

06:59.032 --> 06:59.813
It's a great story.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.535
He was quite a character, wasn't he?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.837
Rosenbach, in some...

07:03.695 --> 07:06.178
He was more than a bookman, I guess.

07:06.819 --> 07:11.564
Well, let me say this.

07:12.165 --> 07:23.298
I think that Hans Krauss, as an example, was probably a better bookman than the doctor.

07:23.418 --> 07:33.330
I think he may have had a wider, deeper knowledge of not all books, granted, but manuscripts and early books.

07:34.205 --> 07:38.210
But, and sold.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.792
Tremendous prices.

07:41.033 --> 07:46.059
But people bought from them, but they didn't like them.

07:46.780 --> 07:47.961
Crouse.

07:47.981 --> 07:48.422
Crouse.

07:49.483 --> 07:54.829
I don't know whether you can get Bill Scheide to talk to you about it.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.073
I'm not going to talk to you about what he told me.

07:58.734 --> 08:03.199
But the feeling is, yeah, sure.

08:03.466 --> 08:06.630
You buy from Krauss because, by God, he's got the books.

08:07.411 --> 08:13.479
But he isn't the kind of person that you're ever going to be a great friend of.

08:14.039 --> 08:26.034
On the other hand, the people who bought from the doctor, Lessing, Arthur Houghton, the Hides, Harry Wadner, so forth and so forth, were good friends.

08:27.697 --> 08:27.797
Yeah.

08:27.817 --> 08:29.639
Shidey, you mentioned Shidey.

08:29.719 --> 08:32.022
That is almost unprecedented where you have

08:32.457 --> 08:33.438
Three generations.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.725
Book collecting really is not normally a hereditary thing.

08:38.765 --> 08:39.385
That's right.

08:40.246 --> 08:44.031
I wonder, and I guess each shiny has had a different interest.

08:44.051 --> 08:47.615
Well, the first shiny really wasn't a rare book collector.

08:47.635 --> 08:48.697
I mean, not.

08:49.257 --> 08:50.018
But he started it.

08:50.198 --> 08:51.340
He started it.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.063
Certainly, he made the fortune that enabled it.

08:54.083 --> 08:54.704
Oh, that's right.

08:54.924 --> 08:56.746
Well, there was oil.

08:57.307 --> 08:57.848
There was oil.

08:58.388 --> 09:00.310
He went out west, western Pennsylvania.

09:00.831 --> 09:01.932
That's what they say.

09:01.993 --> 09:02.413
Titusville.

09:04.402 --> 09:06.024
Just let me identify.

09:06.044 --> 09:12.572
We're talking with Leslie Morris at the Rosenbach Library, 10th January, 1999.

09:12.592 --> 09:12.692
Good.

09:12.712 --> 09:13.192
I'm sorry.

09:13.212 --> 09:14.574
What are you talking about?

09:14.594 --> 09:19.540
Well, I'm not as familiar with the current American collectors as I might be.

09:19.940 --> 09:23.965
Not being in New York, it's kind of hard to keep in touch with a lot of these things.

09:23.985 --> 09:25.607
Certainly, the market has taken off.

09:25.707 --> 09:29.211
I don't know if that means that book collecting has taken off.

09:29.812 --> 09:34.037
That's kind of what happened prior to 1929, too, when you had people who

09:34.625 --> 09:42.113
who really knew nothing, or even worse, cared nothing for books.

09:42.133 --> 09:48.280
David Redden at Southviews in New York feels that we are now embarked in a great golden age.

09:49.301 --> 09:50.943
Ed thinks that's ridiculous.

09:52.745 --> 09:53.686
I'd give myself.

09:53.806 --> 09:57.750
Well, because he said, all right, so the money that is being paid is quite impressive.

09:59.192 --> 10:02.235
Redden also argues that, well, not just the money,

10:02.924 --> 10:05.287
not just the fact that institutions aren't getting them.

10:05.308 --> 10:09.854
Institutions don't have the money, and the benefactor doesn't have the tax incentive that he once had.

10:11.897 --> 10:16.925
But he doesn't really feel that you have the volume of books that are available.

10:16.945 --> 10:19.428
I mean, Henry Huntington went out and bought it.

10:19.448 --> 10:25.357
And in seven years, seven years, you know, put together a truly world-class library.

10:26.058 --> 10:31.847
Wolff says, well, I don't care how much money you have, could you get a full run of Shakespeare quartos?

10:32.007 --> 10:32.728
No, you couldn't.

10:33.417 --> 10:39.603
And then John Van Horn said, I don't even think you could get a full run-up Richard's Almanac.

10:40.524 --> 10:42.946
Well, they certainly can't have our unique copy, so no.

10:43.527 --> 10:45.829
Well, they had it once and they don't have it.

10:46.449 --> 10:48.892
So, yeah, there's an argument.

10:48.912 --> 10:53.356
Now, this is an interesting assignment for Book Woman, I guess.

10:54.057 --> 10:54.637
To work here?

10:54.757 --> 10:54.998
Yeah.

10:55.118 --> 10:56.279
Yes.

10:56.479 --> 11:00.623
I had worked at the University of Chicago for a couple of years before I came here.

11:01.058 --> 11:04.704
And I wasn't really all that familiar with Dr. Rosenbach, I have to admit.

11:05.004 --> 11:16.823
But I find that being here and working so much with the Rosenbach Company archive, which I've kind of made my pet project to get that into usable condition as a research collection.

11:16.903 --> 11:26.779
We've finally finished cataloging the correspondence and cataloging now our auction catalog collection to make it into something that's usable

11:27.316 --> 11:31.300
to investigate book selling in the early 20th century, since he was so important.

11:31.981 --> 11:39.590
And I find that, you know, we have all of these connections to other places, because Dr. Rosenbach handled so much material in his time.

11:39.610 --> 11:40.571
Talk to me a little bit about that.

11:40.591 --> 11:42.513
That is fascinating.

11:44.034 --> 11:57.289
Well, we are such a small institution, and we are very much a collector's collection, so that as for, to call ourselves a research library, we don't really have that many collections that support in-depth research.

11:57.792 --> 12:02.018
We have the Marianne Moore papers, which are probably the most published.

12:02.559 --> 12:06.745
And another room full of books and manuscripts.

12:07.066 --> 12:10.290
We have the Rush family papers, an important Philadelphia family.

12:10.711 --> 12:21.046
And then we have the Rosenbach Company archive, which, before I was here, was never really considered as a research resource.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.229
It was all together in one little room.

12:23.470 --> 12:27.175
It was an old, the same filing cabinets it had been in for years.

12:27.543 --> 12:30.846
people had organized little parts of it and then become discouraged with it.

12:31.767 --> 12:35.871
And it was very difficult to find out anything.

12:36.492 --> 12:47.422
I became, I've always been interested in the movement of books, and who has owned books before, and where have they been, and who has used them, I suppose, being a librarian, it's a kind of natural interest.

12:47.442 --> 12:48.623
Or it has proven out of it.

12:48.924 --> 12:56.571
Yes, I mean, I've become, it's almost like being Seymour de Ricci reincarnated, I sometimes feel, you know, I say, oh yes, well that book was, so it's, yeah.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.767
Have you done some things on that?

12:59.048 --> 13:00.410
Well, I've done these two exhibitions.

13:01.131 --> 13:02.753
Do you have catalogs on it?

13:02.813 --> 13:03.955
I think you got sent the first one.

13:04.035 --> 13:05.397
I got the Redux one, I think.

13:05.417 --> 13:10.664
Yeah, and I know that Ellen had meant to send you this one, which was the first one.

13:12.687 --> 13:13.067
Okay, I heard that.

13:13.088 --> 13:15.451
We'll certainly see that you get a copy before you go.

13:15.491 --> 13:16.833
So you did both of these?

13:16.853 --> 13:17.894
Mm-hmm.

13:17.914 --> 13:21.259
And since I did the first one, everyone was like,

13:21.475 --> 13:23.377
what an interesting idea for an exhibition.

13:23.578 --> 13:25.079
It's like doing it backwards.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.282
You had the books once, and now you don't.

13:29.124 --> 13:33.630
But it makes us connected with all of these different libraries.

13:33.910 --> 13:40.999
It gives us an opportunity to bring in material that we wouldn't have to exhibit ourselves, but that has a connection with us.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.505
Do you think that this is an institution in search of its focus?

13:45.645 --> 13:49.129
No, not its focus, but its function, shall we say.

13:49.149 --> 13:49.930
Well, I think

13:50.230 --> 13:51.431
I don't think so anymore.

13:51.592 --> 13:55.556
I think up until about five years ago that might have been the case.

13:56.177 --> 14:03.665
It's very difficult being both a house museum and a library to balance those two sides of your personality.

14:03.685 --> 14:06.609
And I think we've managed to do it fairly well in the last few years.

14:07.269 --> 14:18.482
And I think it's good that we try to do that because certainly working with museum people you're aware of a different set of issues than you are simply working with librarians.

14:18.850 --> 14:25.620
Certainly our exhibition program is much more fully developed than any research library of this size.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.808
I mean, that's what drives this institution, is exhibitions and public education.

14:30.828 --> 14:37.097
Among dealers, Rosenbach is really, I certainly would never call him unique.

14:40.563 --> 14:47.012
Dealers, as a rule, aren't supposed to be perceived as also being collectors.

14:47.032 --> 14:47.473
I collect.

14:48.061 --> 14:54.087
and if my dealer is also collecting the same author that I am, then you might say, well, he's keeping the best stuff for himself.

14:54.428 --> 14:56.350
Oh, he's going to make the price too dear for me.

14:57.211 --> 15:00.314
And dealers will just tell you that.

15:00.374 --> 15:09.904
He, however, on the other hand, seems to be one who really succeeded in having the most extraordinary clients and yet building a phenomenal library.

15:10.024 --> 15:12.987
And Wolf says, well, he used it to his advantage.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.790
He would say, well, if you don't buy it,

15:16.090 --> 15:18.353
I'm going to keep it for myself.

15:18.373 --> 15:19.575
This is kind of an interesting question.

15:19.595 --> 15:22.719
Although there are a lot of things that he did price way too high.

15:22.739 --> 15:27.326
Do you think he priced some things too high because he didn't want to sell them?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.709
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:29.869 --> 15:32.313
And some things never even were offered.

15:32.633 --> 15:38.161
The Baysom book that he decided to keep for himself that he got from Ireland, he never offered that for sale.

15:38.661 --> 15:40.564
Well, there's a wonderful story about how he got that.

15:40.684 --> 15:41.505
Yes, yes.

15:42.306 --> 15:43.508
This person wrote him.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.271
It said 150 pounds or something.

15:45.291 --> 15:45.591
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:45.858 --> 15:49.163
And that was not the greatest bass soundbook.

15:49.183 --> 15:50.425
Oh, no, no, it's imperfect.

15:50.445 --> 15:52.769
I mean, it locks the title page in the first few leaves.

15:53.110 --> 15:54.452
The one that went to Yale, I guess.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.916
Well, and that's a big story behind it, too.

15:56.936 --> 15:58.158
That's another story, too.

15:58.578 --> 16:07.532
And I asked Edwin about that this morning, and he said, you know, I showed this to a guy named Yale, and I forget his name, Babb or something.

16:07.552 --> 16:09.335
Yeah, James Babb.

16:09.355 --> 16:11.038
And he thought that...

16:11.896 --> 16:17.963
Edwin was giving too much of Fleming's story, you know, not enough of the other story.

16:17.983 --> 16:20.806
Yale really doesn't come out looking too good out of that.

16:20.826 --> 16:20.966
No.

16:21.707 --> 16:23.770
Regardless of how it plays.

16:24.110 --> 16:30.617
Well, you know, I think it was just, it's a story that illustrates how times really had changed.

16:31.158 --> 16:38.066
That in the past, if Rosenbach had done that, bidding for Huntington or Fulcher, they would have screamed and kicked about it.

16:38.086 --> 16:39.548
They would have taken it.

16:39.608 --> 16:40.509
Would have written a check.

16:40.529 --> 16:41.650
And an institution...

16:42.068 --> 16:42.809
I can't do that.

16:44.350 --> 16:53.419
Except that they have such affluent benefactors, and there was a woman who kind of... Mrs. Harkness said she would put it out there and backed off.

16:53.980 --> 16:58.704
I mean, I think there's a lot that was never told about what exactly went on.

16:59.245 --> 17:05.351
Your background, you said you came from Chicago, but you weren't really involved in book selling or...?

17:05.671 --> 17:10.776
No, I had a two-year internship with Bob Rosenthal in Special Collections there.

17:11.043 --> 17:23.684
Through him, I went to England for a year to work for some booksellers, and then went to the University of Leeds and got another master's degree in bibliography and textual criticism, and then came back here and got this child.

17:23.724 --> 17:28.232
So you brought your scholarly baggage to the world of book collecting.

17:28.292 --> 17:37.067
I mean, had you ever even thought of collectors in the world as collectors?

17:37.250 --> 17:41.254
Not collecting as such before I came here, no.

17:41.334 --> 17:44.277
But working here, it's something that's inescapable.

17:44.937 --> 17:46.118
Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

17:46.138 --> 17:52.805
You have a feel for what motivates people to spend extraordinary amounts of money for paper.

17:54.726 --> 17:56.928
I'm not a book collector myself.

17:57.249 --> 17:58.410
I mean, I don't have the bug.

17:58.910 --> 18:07.138
I mean, I buy books that are useful for my own writing and my own work, but I've never had that, you know,

18:07.574 --> 18:10.678
been bitten by the collecting bug.

18:10.698 --> 18:21.832
So I tend to take more of a historian's view towards it about, you know, what it tells you about people and the times that they lived in, more than from a sense of personal understanding of collecting, I think.

18:21.852 --> 18:33.386
Having been through the Rosenberg archives, Edwin did indicate that there were a number of things that he didn't have access to because they were in New York.

18:33.406 --> 18:34.287
I think they were plumbing.

18:34.508 --> 18:37.311
Yes, that's kind of an interesting story.

18:37.679 --> 18:51.235
When John Fleming bought the business from the trustees of the foundation back in 1955, he retained all of the New York records, all of the stock books, and all of the stock cards.

18:51.255 --> 19:06.252
So what we had here was really not, it was only half the story, and for say about 1927 on, not really the important part of the story, because the business really did move to New York in the 20s.

19:06.620 --> 19:08.742
It had to, because that's where people went through.

19:08.762 --> 19:10.905
They didn't come to Philadelphia.

19:11.045 --> 19:15.770
And without the stock cards, you had no easy way of indexing the collection.

19:16.772 --> 19:20.035
And there were a lot of things you simply couldn't find out.

19:20.936 --> 19:26.963
Once Fleming died and the executors decided to give all of that back to us, I mean, we had no idea how much was there.

19:27.624 --> 19:31.969
Because you would go up to New York to talk to John about a project, and he would vanish.

19:32.236 --> 19:36.140
and then reappear with the Kunze Collection catalog.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.543
How long have you been with Rosenbach?

19:40.404 --> 19:42.926
Almost six years now.

19:43.967 --> 19:44.107
Really?

19:44.127 --> 19:44.247
Yeah.

19:44.267 --> 19:52.155
What do you think would assist me in getting some kind of insight into Rosenbach?

19:52.175 --> 20:00.943
Well, I think the biography is invaluable because it does give you this overview of the life.

20:02.628 --> 20:09.177
Well, I would recommend reading, say, the correspondence with Sotheby in the company archives.

20:10.258 --> 20:17.948
That was Seymour de Ricci and Sean Leslie, who were both very important as book scouts for Rosenbach.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.670
Who used scouts?

20:19.690 --> 20:21.252
Well, he never really called them that.

20:21.272 --> 20:22.073
They were good friends.

20:24.036 --> 20:27.100
It was kind of an unspoken relationship.

20:29.273 --> 20:43.937
And certainly the Huntington correspondence and the Folger correspondence, his big customers, just to see how persuasive he could be is interesting.

20:43.957 --> 20:51.990
Is there anything revealing about Huntington, for instance, as a collective, the style?

20:52.780 --> 20:56.945
Well, it certainly becomes very clear how omnivorous he was.

20:56.965 --> 21:01.570
I mean, when you just look at the list of things that Rosenbach would send out.

21:02.651 --> 21:04.994
But did he deal directly with Huntington or with staff?

21:06.256 --> 21:14.625
For the most part, with Huntington, although as he got more ill, he did deal with the librarian more.

21:14.665 --> 21:17.809
And after Huntington's death, really, the relationship stopped completely.

21:18.194 --> 21:22.939
The Huntington Library bought next to nothing from the Rosenbach Company after Henry Huntington died.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.860
Really?

21:27.083 --> 21:30.746
I'm wondering whether Huntington is a true collector or an accumulator.

21:32.808 --> 21:35.250
Well, Donald Dickinson, have you spoken to him?

21:35.350 --> 21:35.471
No.

21:35.491 --> 21:37.332
He's working on a biography of Huntington.

21:37.372 --> 21:38.934
He's the one who wrote this.

21:38.954 --> 21:39.735
Is he in Arizona?

21:39.995 --> 21:43.738
Yes, this Dictionary of American Book Collectors he put together.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.442
Nicholas Barker, as well as he was looking at.

21:48.130 --> 21:53.417
Do you know how to get in touch with him?

21:53.517 --> 21:53.777
I don't know.

21:53.798 --> 21:56.882
You just write to him at the University of Irvine.

21:56.902 --> 21:57.983
When was this book published?

21:58.163 --> 21:59.946
Did you publish this?

21:59.966 --> 22:00.086
No.

22:00.106 --> 22:02.349
It's our book plate.

22:02.369 --> 22:06.875
That came out in 87, 88, maybe 88.

22:08.117 --> 22:12.282
Greenwood Press is out of the... In Connecticut.

22:15.940 --> 22:19.665
No, no, this is a new accumulation.

22:19.705 --> 22:26.974
Carl Cannon had done an earlier book on American book collectors, but this is much more kind of a dictionary format.

22:31.019 --> 22:36.606
Okay, we should be able to get this one going.

22:38.268 --> 22:42.353
Greenwood Press, out of Westport, right?

22:48.965 --> 22:50.226
How old is Dickinson?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.149
A young fellow?

22:52.589 --> 22:54.731
I think around 40.

22:55.272 --> 22:58.456
I don't remember if I've ever actually met him.

22:58.476 --> 23:00.118
Do you know what department he's in down there?

23:00.758 --> 23:04.342
I think they have a library science department.

23:04.643 --> 23:05.143
Hi.

23:06.665 --> 23:06.845
Hi.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.088
Hi, Nick.

23:09.208 --> 23:09.728
Ellen Dunlap.

23:09.768 --> 23:11.290
Good to see you.

23:11.310 --> 23:12.371
Good to see you.

23:13.032 --> 23:15.715
Talking to a lesson here about the Rosenberg.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.986
She's the one who knows.

23:21.308 --> 23:23.111
He just talked to Edwin this morning.

23:23.151 --> 23:26.676
I had a stimulating morning with Edwin.

23:27.878 --> 23:31.042
He talks about anything.

23:31.443 --> 23:35.649
It's just wonderful.

23:35.769 --> 23:39.495
It's not necessarily knows all, sees all, fails all, by any means.

23:39.515 --> 23:40.176
By no means.

23:41.037 --> 23:45.263
But tantalizing...

23:45.496 --> 23:52.926
it comes across with a very characteristic flavor.

23:53.086 --> 24:12.212
Now, look, you people just don't, you know, know what I know, and I've been there, and he's that way to the younger of us, and he is, he's had what he calls kindergarten ever since, I guess he started out.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.162
five years ago or so.

24:14.182 --> 24:14.703
Kindergarten.

24:14.903 --> 24:15.844
Kindergarten.

24:16.165 --> 24:29.102
And we would go out, this is before we moved into town, and he would have some of us out to his house in Chestnut Hill on Saturday or Sunday morning.

24:29.382 --> 24:37.393
And Mary would be away playing Contract Bridge or at some aerobics festival or whatever she was doing.

24:37.413 --> 24:38.314
This is his wife.

24:39.015 --> 24:39.195
His wife.

24:39.698 --> 24:48.888
We would talk books and fundraising and gossip and bibliography and the old days.

24:49.468 --> 24:55.574
It started out very much as kind of a, come sit by my side and I will tell you how to run your library.

24:56.976 --> 24:59.579
We all beautifully took notes and all that.

25:00.299 --> 25:08.608
As we each cut our own teeth and started making our own mistakes and having our own successes or whatever, it became

25:08.977 --> 25:15.164
more and more a reminiscence session for him, which was perfectly fine.

25:15.264 --> 25:25.475
And he's done so much for all of us, getting us our jobs and pushing us in one way, goading us into one thing or the other.

25:25.516 --> 25:33.424
Well, you're in Philadelphia, and it's a process that John Van Horset, being here, we like that maybe you didn't take him for granted, you know.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.866
He's a major.

25:38.255 --> 25:46.208
Well, it's a little bit different for John, because obviously Edwin's a hard act to follow.

25:46.228 --> 25:47.810
Edwin is an impossible act to follow.

25:47.910 --> 25:50.034
And not only that, he's there.

25:50.054 --> 25:50.314
He's there.

25:50.334 --> 25:53.519
And also... I mean, we had to interrupt our interview at 11.

25:54.661 --> 26:02.774
I don't know what the call was, but it was a call that he had to take, and that he had to do the talking on it, and then John came in and spoke with me.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.296
I have no idea what this was, but...

26:05.103 --> 26:10.008
Clearly, he's more than an emeritus guy coming in for two hours a day or three days a week.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.690
He must be involved in things.

26:11.770 --> 26:15.774
I think it may have been something, you know, extracurricular or something.

26:16.475 --> 26:20.459
John doesn't let anyone learn anything over there.

26:20.600 --> 26:28.228
But John, and John, see, John doesn't come from the world of rare books or bibliography for the most part either.

26:28.248 --> 26:34.975
So he's a little bit outside, John's a little bit outside the kindergarten circle because it's a lot harder to sit at the,

26:35.765 --> 26:41.831
of your predecessor and looked at him with such grandfatherly eyes.

26:41.851 --> 26:46.596
Especially the guy with, you know, the biography of Rosenbach and the Logan book.

26:47.156 --> 26:58.548
I think that's why Leslie has been in kind of a tough position, but she's done it admirably, because Edwin, I've always said Edwin, Edwin never lets the facts stand in the way of a good story.

26:59.129 --> 27:00.950
I got him to back off the story today.

27:01.231 --> 27:02.532
He will.

27:03.372 --> 27:08.258
The one about Harry Widener going down with the Bacon Essays?

27:08.278 --> 27:09.119
Uh-huh.

27:09.139 --> 27:11.442
And, you know, he said, well, I'll take this with me.

27:11.462 --> 27:13.144
If I'm shipwrecked, it'll go down with me.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.385
It's a wonderful story.

27:14.405 --> 27:16.468
And then, of course, he does die in a Titanic.

27:17.088 --> 27:20.112
And Edwin said, well, you know, that's not, I'm not so sure that's true.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.233
I said, it's in your book.

27:22.595 --> 27:25.579
A lot of things in the book.

27:25.599 --> 27:33.328
Leslie's been going through all of this stuff with the fine-tooth book, and she finds lots of things that aren't exactly the way Edwin told him.

27:33.612 --> 27:38.757
And to rewrite Rosenbach's history as she was doing is very wrong.

27:38.777 --> 27:45.082
I have personally found a number of things that I will quietly correct in the book.

27:45.743 --> 27:49.026
You know, the general tone of it is absolutely right.

27:49.046 --> 27:58.274
But, I mean, if you just take a look at some of the volume of material he had to deal with, I mean, there are lots of little things that he simply did not have the time to verify and to check.

27:58.354 --> 28:00.216
I have four things, and they're all little things.

28:01.036 --> 28:01.797
But they're things.

28:02.452 --> 28:04.014
That happens to be one.

28:05.376 --> 28:11.323
To me, I think it's a wonderful story, and it's apocryphal, and it's nice.

28:11.704 --> 28:14.227
And if it's not true, it ought to be true.

28:15.108 --> 28:26.963
But there were other little things, like on the details of Harry Widenst telling something to Edwin Newton on, when my time comes, there'll be nothing left to me.

28:26.983 --> 28:29.927
Well, Edwin has it being told after wholesale, which

28:30.667 --> 28:33.409
It was perfect, but it didn't happen that way.

28:33.490 --> 28:36.933
According to Newton, I went to Newton's book and found a different version of it.

28:37.813 --> 28:39.095
It's really no big deal.

28:40.196 --> 28:43.258
But as scholars, you know, I mean, you'd like to get it right.

28:43.278 --> 28:45.160
Edwin did not start, yeah.

28:45.180 --> 28:51.466
I mean, Edwin did not start working for the resume coming until 1930, after a lot of these things had taken place.

28:51.586 --> 28:53.388
And he heard it from Dr. Rosenbach.

28:53.408 --> 28:55.209
He was a bigger storyteller than Edwin ever was.

28:55.229 --> 28:58.052
He'd sit out here and have two or three or four drinks.

28:58.072 --> 28:58.192
Right.

28:58.212 --> 28:59.273
A few cigars.

28:59.607 --> 29:25.075
And I think that to cope, so not only in retelling these Rosenbach tales that Leslie's been doing in her two catalogs, you have not only the facts to deal with, but also the whole flavor, the timbre of what Edwin is doing.

29:25.477 --> 29:29.261
is conveying, and it's so pure Rosenbachian.

29:29.281 --> 29:33.767
It's very hard to, I think Lester's done a great job of making it just as lively a story.

29:33.787 --> 29:39.794
I don't want to put you on the spot, and I won't, and my book is going to be a very good-spirited book, for the most part.

29:40.495 --> 29:43.558
I'll talk to you about a few other stories that I'm working on.

29:43.578 --> 29:47.703
It's Garden Sale, which is another thing altogether.

29:47.843 --> 29:49.085
Do you know anything about that?

29:49.105 --> 29:50.226
Bizarre catalogs in the entire world.

29:50.286 --> 29:52.329
Well, they're the most bizarre people in the whole world.

29:52.709 --> 29:53.770
Yes.

29:53.790 --> 29:55.112
I'll go off and tell you some stuff.

29:55.683 --> 29:59.508
I think I will do a chapter on a Shady family library.

29:59.568 --> 30:05.395
That is one, perhaps the only great instance of generational collecting.

30:05.415 --> 30:09.280
Yes, and it's very unusual for collecting to be handed down in a family.

30:09.300 --> 30:09.920
It isn't done.

30:10.301 --> 30:11.162
It's like it's sold off.

30:11.182 --> 30:16.388
You know, I've told my wife, she claims to love my books.

30:16.969 --> 30:23.597
I know that if I go and you can get three grand for this sign of Parker, you'd be a fool not to do it.

30:24.050 --> 30:27.113
Well, I know you're always looking for sources.

30:27.373 --> 30:41.047
I don't know if he would talk or what he knows, but Gordon Marshall, who is the assistant librarian's library company, is married to Bill Shirey's daughter.

30:41.067 --> 30:41.467
Really?

30:42.628 --> 30:44.710
She's supposed to be the fourth generation.

30:46.492 --> 30:46.873
Really?

30:47.713 --> 30:52.318
I have understood that there's a daughter who lives in Moores.

30:52.670 --> 31:01.884
is licking its chops that it's going to get this library, but not as long as it remains with the family.

31:01.904 --> 31:09.795
Well, Gordon Marshall and his wife's family believe that they live in Morristown, not Morristown.

31:09.815 --> 31:10.737
In O.R., actually.

31:11.378 --> 31:14.162
Yeah, in O.R., yeah.

31:14.302 --> 31:14.883
Pennsylvania?

31:14.903 --> 31:21.833
Yeah, no, New Jersey, which is just east of here, other than the Morristown.

31:22.353 --> 31:25.276
And Gordon Marshall.

31:25.296 --> 31:28.900
It's interesting that he's involved in books.

31:28.921 --> 31:37.330
And he's more kind of like chief of operations over there than involved with the bibliographical stuff.

31:37.370 --> 31:39.152
I've already talked to Bill Stoneman.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.575
He's the librarian.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.096
How do you pronounce it?

31:42.236 --> 31:42.636
Shitey?

31:42.856 --> 31:44.098
Shitey.

31:44.118 --> 31:46.160
Bill has not been there too long.

31:47.101 --> 31:48.022
He took Janet E.'

31:48.002 --> 31:51.246
's place, but I think he was.

31:51.597 --> 31:52.919
It's great.

31:53.039 --> 31:56.365
I have every book dealer in America trying to find this book for me.

31:56.385 --> 31:56.886
Look at that.

31:56.906 --> 32:01.333
For Dr. R. This is a shitey library.

32:02.575 --> 32:03.617
And it's inscribed.

32:03.657 --> 32:07.964
For Dr. R. with my affection and esteem, both unqualified.

32:08.084 --> 32:11.309
Julian, January 15, 30, 48.

32:11.329 --> 32:11.850
Yeah, this...

32:12.505 --> 32:17.031
This is the only book on record, you know, of this library.

32:17.151 --> 32:19.395
The correspondence is very interesting, too.

32:19.435 --> 32:20.076
The correspondence?

32:20.176 --> 32:20.356
Yeah.

32:20.436 --> 32:21.397
Oh, yeah.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.021
I actually spent some time quite profitably here, do you think?

32:24.582 --> 32:24.762
Oh, yeah.

32:24.782 --> 32:26.925
Looking through some of your things at some point?

32:26.945 --> 32:39.863
Well, I think that especially after you know kind of you've done a lot of the footwork already, I think that there's

32:41.125 --> 32:47.393
I wouldn't think that you would want to start work here, but I think it would fill in a lot of things.

32:47.854 --> 32:51.218
It's not comprehensive enough to be a good place to begin.

32:51.299 --> 32:54.082
This is not going to be a scholarly.

32:54.102 --> 32:58.789
I'm really looking for good stories.

32:59.229 --> 33:08.061
Well, about the Scheidtys, there's this story about Dr. Rosenbach for a Christmas present for Mr. Scheidtys.

33:08.395 --> 33:11.759
sold this incredible... Which Mr. Scheide is?

33:11.779 --> 33:13.241
This was William Scheide.

33:13.401 --> 33:16.024
This is Mr. Scheide's father.

33:16.064 --> 33:17.586
The one who inscribed that book?

33:17.606 --> 33:19.328
No, no, no, that's Julian Boyd.

33:19.348 --> 33:21.771
That's Julian Boyd.

33:22.212 --> 33:24.675
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:26.017 --> 33:33.266
That Mr. Scheide's sister was married with Mrs. Caldwell, of Caldwell's Jewelers in Philadelphia.

33:33.806 --> 33:35.969
And she wanted a Christmas present for her brother.

33:36.089 --> 33:36.850
So she...

33:37.167 --> 33:51.583
came into the Rosenbach Company just before Christmas, and there was this very expensive incumulable, I can't remember which one it was at the moment, that Dr. Rosenbach had already tried to sell to William Scheide, and Scheide had said, that's too much.

33:52.825 --> 33:59.773
Scheide is one of the very few people who does turn down books for Dr. Rosenbach's autism because he thinks they're too expensive.

33:59.793 --> 34:04.558
So when Mr. Scheide's sister comes in, Dr. Rosenbach sells it to her.

34:05.450 --> 34:21.279
She gives it to William Shady for Christmas, and he goes up the wall and writes this two-page letter to Dr. Who is in the back saying that this was simply not the right thing to do, and how dare you sell my sister this book.

34:21.319 --> 34:25.467
I thought it was overpriced, and then you sold it to her to give to me, and it's simply unfair.

34:25.632 --> 34:29.656
It's really a very good one.

34:29.696 --> 34:30.497
That's a great story.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.399
They just did business then, sir.

34:32.519 --> 34:35.042
No, actually, I wasn't too smart, I think.

34:35.602 --> 34:39.266
He said, I'm going to keep it, but I just, you know, this is better to never happen again.

34:40.367 --> 34:41.448
Did they do business again?

34:41.468 --> 34:42.509
Oh, yeah.

34:42.529 --> 34:43.150
No big deal.

34:43.170 --> 34:46.794
Well, they didn't have the books that he wanted.

34:46.834 --> 34:53.901
Have you learned anything about Rosenbach since you've been here as a person, or that you don't know, that you don't get out of the book?

34:54.472 --> 34:55.754
that you don't get out of the book.

34:56.935 --> 35:06.569
I think the only thing has to do with kind of the early relationship between the two brothers, which isn't really dealt with in the biography.

35:06.589 --> 35:10.775
Edwin never liked Philip, and that does come across quite clearly in the biography.

35:10.795 --> 35:14.841
He told me, in fact, that he's written a piece like that.

35:14.861 --> 35:15.722
Have you read the piece?

35:15.962 --> 35:16.763
Where is it, you know?

35:16.944 --> 35:18.366
It's not published anywhere.

35:18.386 --> 35:19.627
No, it's in his word process.

35:20.489 --> 35:22.251
It's part of his reminiscence to it.

35:23.142 --> 35:24.905
But you have access to that?

35:24.925 --> 35:28.571
Well, he asked me to read it.

35:28.591 --> 35:28.651
Oh.

35:28.671 --> 35:30.213
That's interesting.

35:30.233 --> 35:37.465
But in the early years, I mean, the picture in the biography is that Phillips was, you know, kind of this dominating man who had no taste.

35:37.485 --> 35:38.967
A mania to self, is the phrase.

35:39.167 --> 35:39.428
Right.

35:40.329 --> 35:42.372
Sometimes most have a mania to acquire.

35:42.392 --> 35:43.594
He had the mania.

35:43.674 --> 35:46.118
He uses that word, a mania to self.

35:46.138 --> 35:49.183
And that Dr. Rosenbach was pushed around by Phillips.

35:50.159 --> 35:52.722
And that was probably true in the later years.

35:52.782 --> 35:57.108
But in the earlier years, there was very much, they were pretty much on equal footing.

35:57.128 --> 36:02.655
And Philip listened to what Dr. Rosenbach had to say about how to sell saying the same, and followed his advice.

36:02.675 --> 36:07.642
I think even worse, he paints him as something of a philistine.

36:07.962 --> 36:09.824
I mean, with no taste.

36:09.885 --> 36:15.171
Well, really, the guy didn't know anything about... Philip never really developed an expertise.

36:15.191 --> 36:17.955
In fact, he said the phrase he used.

36:18.307 --> 36:31.427
I think that in many ways their personalities and the sense of the business and all were a very good combination.

36:33.270 --> 36:40.641
I don't get too much of an exaggeration compared to Dr. Oden and I probably wouldn't have sold anything.

36:40.661 --> 36:44.567
You would have become like Uncle Mo and Fatima and his dusty book.

36:44.885 --> 36:55.795
Philip and the bottom line was a healthy thing for Dr. R to spur him on.

36:56.796 --> 37:09.167
So I think that, in some ways, Edwin Plank's a very good-brother, bad-brother kind of picture, which makes for a compelling meaning.

37:09.968 --> 37:14.352
It's an oversimplification.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.895
take pains to point out that, by the way, the doctor was earned.

37:18.656 --> 37:31.517
That was an earned doctorate, which is, you know, every horse's ass can get a given, pardon my phrase, but... Well, he had his honorary doctorate.

37:31.537 --> 37:36.745
Yeah, but I don't think he would have allowed himself, who knows, to be called Doc Doctor if it was that.

37:37.315 --> 37:54.099
I don't think so, but I think there is no denying the fact that Philip tried lots of things to make money that did not work until he took the shredder into the business.

37:54.119 --> 38:07.238
And I say also, he was responsible for many more busts even after they were in partnership with him.

38:07.808 --> 38:15.497
So I think it is interesting in continuing to evolve relationships.

38:15.517 --> 38:21.364
Do you think I could spend a few, not today, but a profitable three or four hours here?

38:22.545 --> 38:23.006
Well, yeah.

38:23.026 --> 38:25.589
Well, I mean, but not much more than that.

38:25.729 --> 38:36.381
I'm just trying to find a couple of good portable things to, you know, realistically, I don't see Rosenberg getting more than 10 pages in my book if he gets that.

38:37.880 --> 38:47.491
But it would really be nice to get something that nobody else has used prior to it.

38:47.571 --> 38:52.337
Well, I think that he's central to the story in a couple of ways.

38:52.357 --> 38:56.882
I don't need the PR pitch on why you would include it before he wrote it.

38:56.902 --> 38:57.583
You don't need PR.

38:58.104 --> 38:59.305
You don't need it.

38:59.325 --> 39:06.874
But it's not only because you look at sales like the Dovini sales, and so many

39:07.343 --> 39:20.217
seminal collections and see how responsible the Rosenbach Company was in forming those collections and to realize how many of the important books that came into this country came through their hands.

39:20.237 --> 39:29.948
But even more importantly, it's because the legends, the lore, are so inherently part of what book collecting was done.

39:29.968 --> 39:36.355
So I think for both fact and fiction, these figures

39:36.638 --> 39:41.523
Would it be possible for me to get a copy of that Scheide letter?

39:41.543 --> 39:46.508
Yeah, well, I'll look it up.

39:47.509 --> 39:51.974
I will be writing about the Scheide letter.

39:51.994 --> 39:55.057
There will be a Voyager show, did you know that?

39:55.077 --> 39:55.277
No.

39:55.297 --> 40:01.764
I think later this month, we're going to have to build stones.

40:01.784 --> 40:05.127
The Voyager club is going to have an exhibit on it in 25 years.

40:07.435 --> 40:13.662
You told me I would be invited to a reception for the China Library at the Golden Club.

40:13.782 --> 40:16.765
There may be a small reception.

40:16.885 --> 40:18.387
Something, yeah.

40:18.407 --> 40:21.711
Which I desperately want to go to, obviously.

40:21.731 --> 40:23.553
I'll have to look at it.

40:23.613 --> 40:26.316
I don't even know that I have my schedule for you.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.777
I'll just check for you, OK?

40:27.797 --> 40:34.084
There is a, the next big exhibition that's opening is the Women's Office.

40:35.465 --> 40:40.210
And I've already talked to Ruth Mortimer.

40:41.388 --> 40:43.811
I don't even think they have it finalized.

40:43.831 --> 40:44.251
They don't.

40:44.371 --> 40:45.312
I just like Marie.

40:46.173 --> 40:46.994
Who's Marie now?

40:47.014 --> 40:48.075
Marie Corey.

40:48.356 --> 40:49.217
Marie Corey.

40:49.477 --> 40:50.178
K-O-R-E-Y.

40:50.818 --> 40:51.719
K-O-R-E-Y.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.241
Where's she?

40:53.661 --> 40:58.647
Well, right now, she's at me and Beth can find a dress to get married in three weeks.

40:58.667 --> 41:01.150
Where does she work?

41:01.270 --> 41:06.716
She is the outgoing head of the liberal department of the underwear.

41:06.776 --> 41:07.416
Right here?

41:07.436 --> 41:08.037
Right here.

41:08.405 --> 41:16.195
She and I was a chief collaborator on the legacy that she was done.

41:17.677 --> 41:20.120
I was scared for that.

41:20.981 --> 41:27.069
And Marie is... Where would I reach Marie here at the Free Library?

41:27.089 --> 41:27.850
She's at home.

41:28.130 --> 41:29.231
I don't mean this minute.

41:29.311 --> 41:31.674
I mean I thought I'd call tomorrow or Friday.

41:31.794 --> 41:33.857
She's at home packing all week long.

41:33.877 --> 41:34.598
So she's leaving.

41:34.915 --> 41:39.359
She's marrying Richard Landon, the head of the Fisher Rivers Library in Toronto.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.382
Book people stick together, don't they?

41:42.422 --> 41:43.544
So she's moving to Canada.

41:43.964 --> 41:47.407
She's moving to Canada at the end of this month.

41:47.427 --> 41:48.048
I'll stick with me, Penny.

41:48.068 --> 41:49.469
She's only 35 miles away.

41:49.509 --> 41:50.771
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:50.791 --> 41:51.912
She'll be easier to try.

41:52.012 --> 41:56.536
She'll have her mind more on books, including books in boxes.

41:56.677 --> 41:58.558
Now, let's talk generally.

41:58.578 --> 42:04.264
Here we have two young, capable, talented, highly

42:04.733 --> 42:15.564
trained, and did have much spoken, young women, and this must be an unusual kind of assignment.

42:16.565 --> 42:19.288
You came from Texas to the Rosenbach.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.791
How many volumes do we have here, roughly?

42:21.811 --> 42:23.532
20,000 volumes.

42:23.552 --> 42:29.098
Roughly, that's a small collection, right?

42:29.118 --> 42:29.759
27,000 volumes.

42:30.019 --> 42:31.681
And last week I was in the University of Chicago.

42:31.701 --> 42:31.821
Right.

42:33.455 --> 42:36.199
I mean, there's something great about having a small collection.

42:36.259 --> 42:40.164
I'm looking for statements like that.

42:40.484 --> 42:48.615
I mean, you know, I can say that I have handled just about everything in this collection, physically.

42:48.635 --> 42:54.242
And certainly you could never say that about being lived at Texas or the University of Chicago.

42:54.263 --> 42:55.704
I mean, it's just impossible.

42:56.245 --> 43:02.213
And the longer you're here, the more you are able to understand about it, because it is a

43:02.598 --> 43:14.897
Because it is small, and you can take on a project and know that you can actually finish it, because it's not at some, you know, tremendously large institution where everything catalogs seems like a hopeless plan.

43:14.917 --> 43:23.731
Okay, having handled everything, virtually everything, do you feel that you understand the focus, the scheme of the collection?

43:23.891 --> 43:28.318
Oh, I think it's very easy to understand the focus of the collection, the collector's collection.

43:28.771 --> 43:30.333
Well, is it a Highspot collection?

43:30.353 --> 43:37.562
It's a Highspot collection, with the exception that I mentioned before when I was talking about us as a research library.

43:38.944 --> 43:41.147
And that... Yeah, but I don't think he had that in mind.

43:41.407 --> 43:48.396
Well, you have to understand that the Rosenbach collection is not just Dr. Rosenbach's collection.

43:48.497 --> 43:56.567
In fact, very little of it was ever Dr. Rosenbach's own personal collection.

43:57.509 --> 44:08.662
Dr. Rosenbach died, and then Phillips died a year later, the trustees selected from Rosenbach Company's stock what they wanted to go into what was then the Rosenbach Foundation.

44:09.283 --> 44:22.939
And so to say that a particular book was part of Dr. Rosenbach's collection, I mean, I know how to find that, but I think until a few years ago, the distinctions were not very apparent even to people who worked here.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.503
And also, Dr. Rosenbach had others.

44:26.821 --> 44:36.817
The books that were here, that were his, you know, close to his, really close to his art kind of books, were Americana books.

44:36.837 --> 44:45.291
And his other special personal collecting interests, like the children's books, he gave to the free library.

44:45.631 --> 44:46.893
And he's Judaica.

44:46.913 --> 44:49.918
I mean, he... Was it a Judaica?

44:49.938 --> 44:52.022
The American Jewish Historical Society.

44:52.042 --> 44:52.482
That's right.

44:52.502 --> 44:54.145
He sold a silent trench.

44:54.445 --> 45:00.901
Yes, another Rosenbach story, in which we were involved, because we were the only people who had... Tell me, tell me, tell me.

45:00.921 --> 45:02.686
I'm starting a chapter with that.

45:02.706 --> 45:03.287
Oh, my gosh.

45:03.327 --> 45:05.553
We need to talk to Peter Solis-Cohen as well.

45:05.573 --> 45:06.736
I don't know if you've talked ahead.

45:06.856 --> 45:07.518
I know Lita.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.307
Peter is Lita's nephew-in-law.

45:11.405 --> 45:15.130
He took the Solacellas name, but he was not a Solacellas name.

45:15.150 --> 45:15.991
She told me that.

45:16.291 --> 45:18.994
Oh, they all take great names.

45:19.014 --> 45:21.317
You know, he's not really a Solacellas.

45:21.377 --> 45:29.167
He's the one who kind of took on the historical authority about all of this, because some Solace Cohen family stuff had been told as well.

45:29.187 --> 45:34.273
Well, there's an interesting... I mean, the guy bought this thing with the express idea that he hated it.

45:34.794 --> 45:35.715
That's right.

45:35.735 --> 45:38.539
And that's the justification.

45:38.579 --> 45:39.640
That's why I'm looking at this.

45:40.058 --> 45:41.921
This really kind of opens up the whole area.

45:42.221 --> 46:02.514
Who collects the unspeakable things, the Holocaust stuff, the Ku Klux Klan stuff, as horrible as it is in order to not, you know, somebody has to keep it to preserve it, because one of my pieces is the collector is more than an accumulator, a true collector, preserves stuff, you know, at some point.

46:02.654 --> 46:05.138
Well, Rosenwald had Rosenbach purchase it.

46:05.405 --> 46:06.626
with that in mind.

46:06.646 --> 46:12.893
He also said that's the only time I ever told the doctor that price is no object.

46:13.114 --> 46:13.394
Buy it.

46:13.414 --> 46:16.057
Well, he only had to pay 4K for it.

46:16.077 --> 46:18.240
But, you know, he never said that with the Gutenberg Bible.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.443
He must have had a price how high he was willing to go.

46:21.483 --> 46:22.665
It was an auction.

46:22.685 --> 46:24.326
It was an auction in Europe.

46:24.366 --> 46:27.430
But he said he wanted it, and then he did not want it to go into the wrong hands.

46:29.412 --> 46:30.834
He didn't even want to keep it for himself.

46:31.314 --> 46:32.676
No, he didn't want anything.

46:33.457 --> 46:34.618
But why did he buy it?

46:35.341 --> 46:38.885
Well, to keep it out of the hands of the Nazis.

46:38.985 --> 46:42.109
It's an interesting collecting story, isn't it?

46:42.129 --> 46:46.174
And I think he just wanted it to be seen in context.

46:46.874 --> 46:51.860
And that's why it went not into his own personal collection, but to the Jewish Historical Society.

46:51.980 --> 46:54.003
That's the best yet.

46:54.023 --> 47:01.051
Where it won't be kind of plucked out and held up as this anti-Semitic text.

47:01.191 --> 47:01.872
Which it was.

47:02.071 --> 47:09.166
Which it was, but it could be viewed in the context of all of this other... We're talking about the murder of children here.

47:09.287 --> 47:12.574
Ritual murder, you know, of child names.

47:12.594 --> 47:21.092
We needed two sentences out of this to... But given those times, you know, this was just all... Listen, we've got a story up in Boston about the guy who...

47:21.376 --> 47:22.678
Oh, yeah.

47:22.698 --> 47:23.659
It's not just Boston.

47:23.679 --> 47:28.285
Well, I mean, the whole white community went berserk over this as, well, they should, you know.

47:29.747 --> 47:30.729
But these things happen.

47:30.749 --> 47:35.575
But I think that... How did you become involved in this thing before we generalize?

47:35.936 --> 47:36.697
Oh, God.

47:37.378 --> 47:42.245
Well, everyone was trying to find out.

47:43.646 --> 47:49.915
I mean, from... My understanding is that the American Jewish Historical Society

47:50.249 --> 47:55.878
didn't even really know how it came to be there, or what the reason was that they had it.

47:56.699 --> 48:01.727
They knew that they had to wait until a certain date, and then they sold it.

48:03.409 --> 48:04.611
And they didn't even wait that long.

48:04.852 --> 48:07.636
They didn't, well, it was close, I mean, a few weeks.

48:08.037 --> 48:12.223
And Lessing Rosenwald

48:12.625 --> 48:15.829
writes about it in his reminiscences of a collector.

48:15.869 --> 48:17.251
I cannot find that book.

48:17.431 --> 48:18.372
Well, it's right over there.

48:18.653 --> 48:21.256
Can you at least show me what the book looks like?

48:21.276 --> 48:23.239
Sure.

48:23.299 --> 48:24.861
It's black and a slip stitch.

48:24.881 --> 48:29.567
That is a very difficult book to find.

48:31.489 --> 48:40.641
There is material in the files about this.

48:41.532 --> 48:47.059
Did he actually, was he correct that he gave the doctor a, this has never been read, do you know that?

48:47.279 --> 48:47.940
No, it wouldn't have to.

48:48.120 --> 48:48.541
I've read it.

48:48.561 --> 48:53.147
Look at it, it's, it's... We wash our hands.

48:54.829 --> 48:56.271
It's a beautifully done book.

48:57.011 --> 48:58.593
There's not a whole lot of content to it.

48:58.694 --> 49:00.916
I mean, you don't really go to it to find out.

49:01.838 --> 49:03.159
It's not that old a book.

49:03.660 --> 49:05.722
Why cannot I find a copy of this?

49:05.742 --> 49:08.586
It's very, I mean, it was privately distributed.

49:08.819 --> 49:14.165
And when you've got any grandchildren at Blessing Reginald, that's a big part of the press run, I think.

49:14.185 --> 49:20.973
I'm surprised that nobody... Chincintown.

49:21.534 --> 49:22.275
Elberthorpe.

49:22.775 --> 49:31.585
That was the name of the gallery, and the Elberthorpe Gallery was where the art and the books were passed.

49:31.605 --> 49:32.787
What was the limitation of this?

49:32.827 --> 49:37.132
Do we know offhand?

49:37.232 --> 49:38.353
250 copies.

49:40.004 --> 49:42.908
I'm sure the Rosenwald family still has a lot of them.

49:42.928 --> 49:43.889
Wouldn't you think?

49:44.750 --> 49:45.431
I don't know.

49:45.551 --> 49:48.835
I don't know how they distributed them.

49:48.855 --> 49:50.297
Where is the Rosenwald family?

49:50.317 --> 49:59.668
Well, Edith, a blessing's widow, died a year ago, two days after Christmas.

50:00.349 --> 50:08.139
And her son, Julius Dooley Rosenwald, is the executor of the estate.

50:08.159 --> 50:09.741
And there are...

50:09.923 --> 50:20.335
A number of Westingian youth children are still around here, but Dooley is the one that we have the most contact with.

50:20.355 --> 50:30.807
And his son-in-law, Werner Bootsheimer, is the director of the Folger Shakespeare Library.

50:30.927 --> 50:36.133
It's almost incestuous as well.

50:36.839 --> 50:40.944
Well, this is, we're going up in directions I never dreamed that we were going to .

50:40.964 --> 50:50.195
Well, we were talking about, you know, what, you know, we're trying to make the collection usable in such a way that it answers questions like this, about book collectors and collections.

50:50.495 --> 50:50.595
Well.

50:50.615 --> 51:02.830
And I think that in some ways, I mean, coming from such a broad collection as Texas, one might think, oh, this is so confining because

51:03.147 --> 51:09.496
You know, it's so much smaller and so much more limited in some way.

51:09.516 --> 51:23.496
But the fact that it is all centered around such a very large image of a man or of these brothers gives it a kind of a cohesion.

51:23.596 --> 51:30.927
And it's not like a small collection put together by two people who didn't matter or that

51:31.109 --> 51:34.012
included materials that only mattered to them.

51:34.493 --> 51:43.623
I mean, how can you be unexcited about the manuscript of Ulysses or the Faison book or, you know, or all these things?

51:43.643 --> 51:47.807
I mean, this is that string of pearls that I've got to do that.

51:47.827 --> 51:49.549
Yeah, give me that quote again.

51:52.392 --> 51:59.580
He denies it, but I told people when I first came here, when they asked me, you know, coming from Texas here,

51:59.982 --> 52:04.387
What's it like my husband said to someone?

52:04.407 --> 52:17.423
At Texas, it was like Ellen was dealing with the whole bottom of the ocean floor, you know, the wrecked ships and sunken treasure and just all kinds of unmined strange fish.

52:17.703 --> 52:21.728
Very strange fish, a few sea monsters and so on.

52:21.948 --> 52:24.912
But at Rosenbach, it's just like a string of pearls.

52:25.753 --> 52:27.795
Perfect pearls, isn't it?

52:27.860 --> 52:28.842
No, no.

52:29.442 --> 52:43.905
And there are some things that have a nicer path than others, but I think that in general... And it's not, to me, it's all so interconnected.

52:43.925 --> 52:50.195
I mean, you call it incestuous, but the world of scholarship is of making connections.

52:50.696 --> 52:52.939
And I can't tell you how often...

52:53.324 --> 53:02.975
I see people here that I knew in Texas, you know, there were search paths, crosses, back and forth, criss-crosses around through all these collections.

53:03.115 --> 53:05.398
Well, I was telling Leslie that it's amazing.

53:05.458 --> 53:13.868
I really know there comes a point where I really have to see somebody when two or three different people mention their names to me.

53:14.809 --> 53:16.911
You know, for instance, this guy at Arizona.

53:18.874 --> 53:21.677
Nicholas Barker came from Worcester at the Antiquarian Society.

53:22.703 --> 53:24.985
He says, you really got to see this guy, Dickinson, in Arizona.

53:25.005 --> 53:26.968
He's doing a biography of Huntington.

53:26.988 --> 53:33.274
So I sit right down to me while I'm calling for ten people a week and talking to them, setting up as many of these scripts as I can.

53:34.235 --> 53:35.657
And now you do it again.

53:35.677 --> 53:37.198
I ask you about Huntington.

53:37.218 --> 53:39.141
He says, oh, this guy, Dickinson.

53:39.161 --> 53:40.222
Is that the guy in Arizona?

53:40.302 --> 53:40.942
I asked you.

53:40.962 --> 53:41.443
He said, yes.

53:41.503 --> 53:42.824
I said, you're the second one.

53:44.206 --> 53:44.967
You know, these names.

53:45.848 --> 53:49.892
Now, this is Nicholas Barker from England telling me about a guy in Arizona who knows

53:50.142 --> 53:51.984
as much as there is to know about Huntington.

53:52.064 --> 53:55.968
Well, and Dickinson is just very much on.

53:55.988 --> 54:02.415
I mean, he really is kind of in the peak of this research and turning over the stones.

54:04.798 --> 54:09.723
I gather there's probably a lot of other people who know a lot about Huntington.

54:09.743 --> 54:13.067
Well, I'm not competitive in any way to what he's doing.

54:13.087 --> 54:16.591
I'm looking, you know, for five or six pages on the guy.

54:16.611 --> 54:19.474
But something that would really profile him

54:20.180 --> 54:24.726
other than what you get from the Huntington Library.

54:24.746 --> 54:25.366
It's wonderful.

54:25.567 --> 54:28.851
I saw one quote in a book about his art collecting.

54:29.111 --> 54:33.657
Somebody said, oh God, that he owned every judge and everybody else in California.

54:33.677 --> 54:34.858
Have you ever seen that quote?

54:34.878 --> 54:37.201
No, not surprising.

54:37.221 --> 54:41.646
I mean, the guy, what he didn't have, he bought.

54:41.666 --> 54:43.148
And he married his uncle's wife.

54:43.168 --> 54:45.411
And he married his uncle's wife.

54:45.931 --> 54:47.553
Did he know his books?

54:47.813 --> 54:50.456
Again, to go back, I think that came in context.

54:50.597 --> 54:53.140
I asked if he... Whether he was an accumulator or a collector.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.121
Or did he know his books?

54:55.823 --> 54:56.664
How could he possibly?

54:56.684 --> 54:59.627
He had a whole staff in New York, even just... Some of them were never unpacked.

54:59.647 --> 55:02.631
Some of them were never even unpacked.

55:02.651 --> 55:06.656
He just wanted to put together a great collection, and that's what counted.

55:08.078 --> 55:12.563
I mean, he did put together a book collection, and he didn't choose, you know.

55:12.998 --> 55:17.883
Well, they probably hired some wonderful people, too, if that helps.

55:18.103 --> 55:26.572
Well, Huntington, before Dr. Rosenbach, had his agent, George D. Smith, I'm not sure if the name was one of the four.

55:26.972 --> 55:36.202
And really, if Smith had not died when he did, the question of whether Rosenbach would have become the dealer that he became... That's in the book, but I mentioned that to Edwin this morning.

55:36.222 --> 55:37.403
I said you'd point out that

55:37.957 --> 55:43.643
One of the luckiest things to happen to the doctor's career was that Smith died when he did.

55:44.564 --> 55:45.646
He has a letter in the book.

55:45.926 --> 55:46.767
I forget who he wrote.

55:47.508 --> 55:48.949
You know, I would like to be your dealer now.

55:49.410 --> 55:53.835
You know, I'm sure I'll... We'll be happy to execute any of your questions.

55:53.855 --> 55:57.299
And I'm sure that they jumped on the band right now.

55:57.499 --> 55:58.941
At some point, I want to talk about Texas.

56:01.123 --> 56:04.547
I hear your arrival may be anticipated.

56:06.369 --> 56:07.390
What do you hear?

56:08.045 --> 56:09.972
I don't know if this is really...
