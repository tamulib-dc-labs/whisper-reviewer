WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:07.325
Any San Francisco public library, the old public library?

00:08.772 --> 00:11.948
Just see if we can pick up the beep beeps here of the bar cards.

00:22.998 --> 00:27.763
Okay, we're talking to Laurie.

00:27.783 --> 00:28.864
How do we pronounce your name?

00:28.884 --> 00:31.226
Laurie McEachern, right?

00:31.246 --> 00:32.848
It's McEachern, yes.

00:33.308 --> 00:34.789
M-C-E-A-C-H-R-O-N.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.691
So you were just about to give me some idea.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.293
Yeah, a brief overview of Corvus.

00:38.313 --> 00:40.235
We were actually founded back in 1989.

00:40.815 --> 00:42.977
The company was started by Bill Gates.

00:43.258 --> 00:44.859
He owns the company personally.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.942
He started it in his capacity as a private individual.

00:48.322 --> 00:49.243
Really?

00:49.363 --> 00:51.105
Yeah, we are a private corporation.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.026
We have no...

00:52.495 --> 01:02.649
no business attachment to Microsoft, which is a common confusion because he's chairman of Microsoft, which is a public company, and he's also owner of Corbus, which is a private company.

01:02.709 --> 01:04.772
People think that they are connected.

01:05.794 --> 01:18.992
Bill founded the company with the vision of converging technologies, the idea that entertainment and computers and television and telecommunications were all converging.

01:19.360 --> 01:33.842
And at some point, when all the hardware issues work themselves out, that what would become important was content, was digital content, whether that be images, audio, film, video, the elements that came

01:33.923 --> 01:41.058
to you through these hardware and telecommunications machines.

01:41.078 --> 01:43.824
I don't believe so.

01:43.884 --> 01:48.694
It started out very small with just three or four people researching digital content.

01:48.835 --> 01:49.336
What is it?

01:49.516 --> 01:50.318
How do you get it?

01:50.638 --> 01:51.540
How do you market it?

01:51.721 --> 01:52.803
Is there a market for it?

01:52.823 --> 01:54.767
They were doing a lot of research into

01:55.118 --> 01:56.760
what this new thing was.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.025
Back in 1989, late 89, early 90, not a lot of people were thinking about it yet.

02:02.065 --> 02:03.807
The Internet was still on the horizon.

02:04.287 --> 02:10.133
People weren't quite sure what digital content was, and so we were doing a lot of research into that area.

02:10.193 --> 02:21.244
The first three, four years of the company were spent in research and development, looking at software systems for managing digital content, software systems for searching.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.744
and retrieving images very quickly.

02:24.064 --> 02:26.128
How do you protect digital content?

02:26.889 --> 02:27.911
What are the markets?

02:28.131 --> 02:30.435
Who are the customers for digital content?

02:30.475 --> 02:38.028
So we really were kind of focused internally discovering this idea of digital content and what we might be able to do with it.

02:39.510 --> 02:43.577
Why did you establish it apart from Microsoft?

02:43.597 --> 02:47.704
Partly because it was such an emerging area.

02:47.870 --> 02:51.795
can't take the same kinds of risks that private companies can.

02:51.935 --> 03:04.190
This was, you know, back then a very, very long-term kind of a project and a research and development project that really wasn't in line with Microsoft's focus on software applications.

03:04.931 --> 03:10.998
You know, we were looking at digital content broadly and all the potential possibilities of what could be done with it.

03:11.158 --> 03:14.923
And that was really outside the charter, I think, of that other company.

03:15.612 --> 03:22.540
So when these archives like the Bettman Archive are acquired, basically it's Mr. Gates who's acquiring you.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.061
It's Corbis that's acquiring it.

03:24.081 --> 03:25.903
We're a corporation, so we acquire it.

03:25.963 --> 03:31.309
He is the chairman of Corbis, but the Corbis Corporation acquired the Bettman Archive.

03:32.230 --> 03:41.400
And the licensing rights to any number of other... Yeah, we have over 400 sources right now that are partnering with us, most of them non-exclusive licenses.

03:41.498 --> 03:45.704
But as I was saying, you know, we spent some years in research and development.

03:46.144 --> 03:53.915
About, oh, three years ago, almost three years ago now, we had collected a great resource of material.

03:54.296 --> 03:59.043
We'd done a number of years of research in how to manage it, how to market it, how to package it.

03:59.423 --> 04:04.690
We decided we were ready to go to the markets and begin to get some feedback from the markets.

04:05.351 --> 04:07.995
At that point, we developed a professional licensing business.

04:08.279 --> 04:16.552
which works very similar to a photo agency where book publishers and magazine publishers can come and license images from us to using their products.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.460
And then we also formed a publishing business, which was targeted more at consumer audiences.

04:22.001 --> 04:31.096
And that was where we were packaging more editorial type products, interactive documentary products on CD-ROM and selling them into consumer markets.

04:31.617 --> 04:34.742
So those were really the two markets we identified that were

04:35.043 --> 04:40.190
interested in digital images and that we could begin to start to emerge into those markets.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.313
When did you release your first title?

04:42.634 --> 04:48.822
Passion for Art was the first one, and it was released in January of 95.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.108
So it's over a year and a half old.

04:53.809 --> 04:55.492
That was our very first consumer product.

04:55.532 --> 04:59.998
We also launched our professional licensing business in February, I believe, of 95.

05:00.238 --> 05:03.463
And a professional licensing business basically is...

05:04.135 --> 05:07.779
Somebody wanted to use a picture of Winston Churchill from the Bettman Archive.

05:09.521 --> 05:10.862
Why are the rights to do that?

05:11.262 --> 05:12.644
Are you doing this online?

05:13.485 --> 05:16.988
We have a website where people can look at a catalog of images.

05:17.429 --> 05:24.957
The archive right now is about 800,000 images in digital form with attached captioning and text and keywording information.

05:25.517 --> 05:27.379
On our website, there's about 4,000 or 5,000.

05:27.740 --> 05:31.864
So very, you know, kind of a slice of the archive, a selection.

05:32.063 --> 05:37.171
that people, the public, can browse and look at and kind of get a sense of what we're about.

05:37.211 --> 05:47.628
There's a professional side to the forum that we're just developing that would allow professional image users to access the entire collection via the website and search through more images.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.392
But then how do you pay for that?

05:50.472 --> 05:52.215
If I can see an image and copy it?

05:52.651 --> 05:56.196
I don't know what prevents an individual from doing that.

05:56.216 --> 06:01.302
I know my daughter, for instance, my 13-year-old daughter took a picture of Winston Churchill for a paper that she did.

06:01.583 --> 06:05.127
I don't think she had to pay anything to use it, but how did she get to use that?

06:05.148 --> 06:09.894
Right now, if you go up to the public forum, the images are encrypted and they're watermarked, so you can look at them.

06:10.054 --> 06:12.237
But if you download them, they're going to come with a watermark on them.

06:12.257 --> 06:13.779
They're not commercially usable.

06:14.099 --> 06:15.561
You can use them for personal use.

06:15.581 --> 06:16.903
Like for a paper at school.

06:17.120 --> 06:23.148
Well, that technically is, you know, there's a gray area there on what's fair use for education.

06:23.648 --> 06:28.415
The images that are publicly accessible are protected so that they're not commercially usable.

06:28.555 --> 06:38.568
Because we do have a responsibility to our partners, the creative partners who created that photograph, who deserve compensation for its commercial use.

06:38.768 --> 06:44.055
Yeah, you know, so the public forum, you know, is guarded.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.464
The professional forum, again, you have to have a password.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.088
You have to be a client of Corvus.

06:49.148 --> 06:50.130
We know who you are.

06:50.170 --> 06:51.252
We have a relationship.

06:51.653 --> 06:55.761
We know that you understand rights issues because you're a professional image licensor.

06:56.222 --> 07:01.833
So when you go up into the professional side, it is still an encrypted image, but it's no longer watermarked.

07:01.853 --> 07:06.482
So you're able to look at it and use it for comp and placement purposes.

07:06.682 --> 07:12.931
You still need to negotiate a fee and license that image if you want it in a commercially usable form.

07:12.971 --> 07:23.567
For instance, when I gave Otto a copy of my book, which he liked very much, and he was looking through the illustrations that I acquired myself and said, these are wonderful.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.229
He said, too bad you didn't call us.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.653
He said, you know, we could have gotten these for you.

07:27.673 --> 07:31.018
But I'm thinking, you know, my next book, maybe images.

07:31.370 --> 07:34.235
So the procedure would be I would establish a professional relationship with you.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.318
Establish a client relationship.

07:36.559 --> 07:37.600
We would give you a password.

07:37.620 --> 07:47.657
You could go up to the website, type in your password, and you can search the full archive and make selections and send an order to us, and then we negotiate a fee based on the use.

07:47.677 --> 07:48.399
Based on the use.

07:48.419 --> 07:49.400
So we're going to do it now.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.083
Exactly.

07:51.468 --> 07:54.773
You know, the Rosenbach Library.

07:54.874 --> 08:00.122
Our licensing service functions very much like a stock photo agency, except that it's all digital.

08:00.202 --> 08:01.524
We deliver it to you digitally.

08:01.965 --> 08:05.911
And we can create a digital file that works for your pre-press needs.

08:06.012 --> 08:09.658
So your production house, your printer, says, I need a MAC file.

08:09.718 --> 08:11.220
I need it to be this resolution.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.083
I need it compressed.

08:13.103 --> 08:17.931
And you tell us that, we create a custom file for you that fits right into your production process.

08:18.097 --> 08:22.463
There's a lot of cost savings and time savings in using digital content.

08:22.823 --> 08:32.317
As that publishing market goes more and more towards digital, digital content will become more and more interesting to them and more and more, you know, common in use.

08:32.857 --> 08:35.982
I should show you the file that I have just contacting libraries.

08:36.102 --> 08:37.023
Oh, yeah.

08:37.363 --> 08:43.632
Well, that right there is one of the benefits of Corvus because we're partnering with sources all around the world.

08:44.118 --> 08:46.420
You have such a variety of material here.

08:46.500 --> 08:56.710
You could come here and sign one contract with us and pay one fee and you have access to the material from over 400 sources, photographers, libraries, art museums, collections of all kinds.

08:57.171 --> 09:06.080
It saves you the time of having to go and get an image from this library and pay another fee to this library and another fee to this photographer and go find all this yourself.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.581
We've done that for you.

09:07.601 --> 09:11.425
We've created an edited collection of tremendous value.

09:11.557 --> 09:12.859
A wonderful quality.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.423
And as we walk around, I'll show you the different areas involved.

09:16.563 --> 09:23.993
I can see where you have a continuing contract, let's say, with a newspaper or a book publisher.

09:24.013 --> 09:30.241
How about an individual like myself who's writing one book who doesn't really need a continuing contract?

09:30.401 --> 09:32.063
Well, you're a professional image.

09:32.212 --> 09:35.237
Image user, you can come and buy once from us.

09:35.297 --> 09:39.083
You would just work with our sales staff to determine an appropriate price.

09:39.103 --> 09:40.546
So if everything's negotiable?

09:40.646 --> 09:41.607
It's all negotiated.

09:41.728 --> 09:42.889
You know, what's your distribution?

09:42.949 --> 09:43.691
How many images?

09:43.751 --> 09:44.632
How many languages?

09:44.692 --> 09:45.934
How long do you need the rights?

09:46.014 --> 09:46.976
Is it a cover shot?

09:46.996 --> 09:49.320
Is it an interior half page, quarter page?

09:49.380 --> 09:50.642
All the same criteria.

09:50.622 --> 09:54.326
He said, no, I mean, I had to go through all this with the British Library.

09:54.766 --> 09:56.488
Is it for world English?

09:56.508 --> 09:57.750
Is it for all languages?

09:57.810 --> 09:58.871
What's the first print run?

09:58.931 --> 09:59.472
Exactly.

09:59.752 --> 10:01.073
All of those affect the price.

10:01.093 --> 10:03.916
And it was, you know, and there was a scale fee.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.798
But that's one of the reasons.

10:05.878 --> 10:06.339
Exactly.

10:06.359 --> 10:12.045
That's one of the reasons that we decided to enter into the licensing business is because it's a business that we could understand.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.527
It's a business that's here today.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.189
There's established pricing.

10:15.229 --> 10:17.551
There's markets already developed for it.

10:17.631 --> 10:19.313
It was something we could get our hands around.

10:19.613 --> 10:27.163
There are markets that are going to emerge for digital content that will be very different, that nobody really knows what those markets might be.

10:27.304 --> 10:31.850
But today, there's a market for digital images, and it's in the professional licensing area.

10:31.890 --> 10:37.377
Will Doug have some comments on, you know, the future of books as we know them?

10:37.538 --> 10:38.239
Absolutely.

10:38.659 --> 10:41.864
And Curtis as well can talk to you more about kind of the vision thing.

10:41.884 --> 10:45.148
Because I still have to keep my eye on the wall as they say when I'm writing it.

10:45.618 --> 10:54.311
So, you know, that professional market was very important to us, but then we also realized the consumer market is really going to be very important to us.

10:54.391 --> 10:59.198
We want people in their homes and in their libraries and in their schools to be able to access this collection.

10:59.639 --> 11:07.210
And we started out on CD-ROM because right now there's not really a lot of connectivity into the home, high bandwidth connectivity.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.935
You know, you're still working over a modem, and that's still very, very slow.

11:11.316 --> 11:15.422
So today we're packaging it on CD-ROM because you can get a very high quality experience.

11:15.757 --> 11:17.699
and people can really enjoy the material.

11:18.559 --> 11:30.590
As we emerge, as the technologies advance, we'll begin doing CD-ROMs with online connections, and then eventually products that are designed and developed entirely for an online environment.

11:31.130 --> 11:35.074
But that's really dependent on how soon technology improves.

11:35.594 --> 11:42.821
But today we're delivering on CD-ROM to consumers, a very editorialized product.

11:42.921 --> 11:45.443
We take the images, we tell a story with them.

11:45.642 --> 11:50.709
lay them out with audio and music and we tell a story and we hand it to you on CD-ROM.

11:51.510 --> 11:59.922
Someday in the future, you're going to log in and tell your own story and you'll be combining elements that interest you and you'll be having an experience online.

12:00.382 --> 12:07.833
But we needed to emerge into that market and begin to speak to consumers and let them know who we were and let them know the quality of the material we had.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.336
And so we did that on CD-ROM initially.

12:11.077 --> 12:15.463
And we had great- I have to tell you that, you know, name recognition for quality.

12:16.726 --> 12:18.694
They're important, particularly in consumer markets.

12:19.699 --> 12:22.732
And that's something that we've really, I think, had a great success with.

12:22.812 --> 12:25.825
All four of our existing titles have won awards.

12:26.378 --> 12:30.585
Can you break down on that?

12:30.705 --> 12:31.446
Oh, sure, sure.

12:31.466 --> 12:34.311
I've got a list of the numerous awards that we've won.

12:34.652 --> 12:35.794
Great critical acclaim.

12:35.814 --> 12:40.221
They're selling very well in bookstores, in museum gift stores, in software stores.

12:40.261 --> 12:44.488
We're in a lot of alternative channels where you don't normally find software.

12:44.508 --> 12:48.575
You wouldn't think to go to a museum store and find a CD-ROM, but you are.

12:48.675 --> 12:50.077
Exactly, exactly.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.660
And I have to say, going through that,

12:53.176 --> 12:55.318
The index shows a little.

12:55.439 --> 12:56.099
The little thumbnail.

12:56.139 --> 12:57.241
Curtis invented that.

12:57.281 --> 12:58.542
That's brilliant.

12:58.562 --> 13:01.866
And the fact that you can do details and zoom in on the details.

13:01.926 --> 13:02.126
Exactly.

13:02.146 --> 13:05.290
Because I've got a super high resolution screen.

13:05.971 --> 13:15.382
But that was something very important to us, was to create those kinds of experiences that were very, very well done, very high production quality standards on these products.

13:15.842 --> 13:20.668
And really try and build a reputation for fine products, attractively priced.

13:20.851 --> 13:45.508
and available broadly in in many many places not just in software stores but you know other other channels as well do you have goals for a number of titles per year or is this not hard goals we expect to do anywhere between maybe you know two to five titles per year just depending on how things work out and you know we have two internal development teams which i'll show you later this morning that work on that so there's

13:45.843 --> 13:49.389
You know, it just depends, but not a huge number of titles per year.

13:49.409 --> 13:51.713
We want to do very high-quality work in just a few.

13:52.355 --> 13:54.759
And how many people employ that core results?

13:54.779 --> 13:58.566
We have probably all told somewhere between 200 and 250.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.291
We have about 130 here in Bellevue.

14:01.491 --> 14:06.019
We've got close to 100 in New York and then another 30 or so in London.

14:06.059 --> 14:08.323
And what did the 100 in New York do?

14:08.624 --> 14:11.589
They're focused on commercial licensing of images.

14:11.849 --> 14:16.176
It's based in the Bettman offices, so they're doing a lot of licensing there.

14:16.196 --> 14:22.906
They're also beginning to scan some of the Bettman collection and move it into the digital archive as well.

14:23.026 --> 14:26.071
So the technical stuff largely is done here?

14:26.131 --> 14:31.139
Most of the scanning is done here and in London, and I'll show you the scanning labs as we go through.

14:31.299 --> 14:33.803
I'm going to London for some more big stuff.

14:33.823 --> 14:34.564
Oh, absolutely.

14:34.730 --> 14:52.872
The London office, we started actually early on as a production facility because many of the collections we were working with were in Europe, and rather than try and ship them transatlantic and all the hassles involved in that, we found it real favorable to have a production facility in Europe so we could do the scanning there.

14:52.892 --> 14:58.179
So when I get to see a production facility, is it something that would be good for me to take pictures of?

14:58.199 --> 14:59.961
It's probably the most high-tech

15:00.194 --> 15:01.656
looking stuff you'll see here.

15:01.716 --> 15:04.420
Most of what you'll see is little offices like this.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.666
So it's probably nothing that's really going to be that sexy for pictures.

15:08.766 --> 15:09.687
It's okay.

15:09.847 --> 15:12.631
You're welcome to check it out and see.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.896
I won't be needing a computer for anything.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.439
I just didn't want to leave it out in the car.

15:18.479 --> 15:20.522
I didn't want to leave it in the hotel room.

15:20.843 --> 15:24.107
Please, before leave today.

15:24.328 --> 15:27.552
And the coffee machine is back here.

15:28.038 --> 15:34.294
Just give me that piece again about everybody is a potential client.

15:34.354 --> 15:37.923
Anyone who's using images is a potential client for us.

15:38.043 --> 15:40.630
Everyone from book and magazine publishers,

15:40.880 --> 15:52.037
Newspapers, graphic design, ad agencies, CD-ROM producers, web publishers, anybody that's professionally using images is a potential client for our archive.

15:52.538 --> 15:55.642
We have such a broad spectrum of content.

15:55.702 --> 16:01.832
We have interest in a lot of, you know, these markets can find material here that is very interesting.

16:01.852 --> 16:03.394
And as they're starting, what time are they?

16:03.560 --> 16:04.161
6 a.m.

16:04.261 --> 16:04.883
to 6 p.m.

16:04.903 --> 16:07.468
West Coast time.

16:07.528 --> 16:14.501
We also have a sales office in New York and a sales office in London, so we are in multiple time zones.

16:14.521 --> 16:16.024
In the major time zones.

16:16.185 --> 16:18.249
These guys will work with a client on the phone.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.497
Currently, say a book publisher calls up, they're doing a book

16:22.797 --> 16:43.029
on Africa, and the sales representative will talk with them and be pulling up images on their computer screen about Africa, the animals, the art, the people, the geography, any images we might have on that topic, and then they'll press a custom CD-ROM catalog of just those images that are interesting to the client, send it to them overnight.

16:43.409 --> 16:50.340
Now the client can look at those images, can print them out for placement purposes, they can show them to their office workers, they make their decision,

16:51.046 --> 16:53.629
And they call back and they say, we want this one, this one, and this one.

16:53.649 --> 16:55.191
This is the use.

16:55.211 --> 16:59.436
They negotiate a fee, and then they tell us what format they need the images in.

16:59.636 --> 17:04.321
We cut a custom CD with the final high-resolution images and send them overnight.

17:04.982 --> 17:16.395
And as technologies advance and as more and more publishers get high bandwidth connection, we're actually starting to do a lot of this on the Internet where the publishers will...

17:16.628 --> 17:28.801
be able to call up and the researcher will post the search results to the Internet and allow that client through that password form that we talked about to go up and look at the selections online rather than waiting for a CD.

17:29.242 --> 17:33.967
And then they make their selections, negotiate the fee, and the high-risk files are delivered on CD-ROM.

17:33.987 --> 17:37.691
Or if they have the bandwidth, we can deliver them via the online.

17:37.811 --> 17:39.733
What we found is that while we have

17:39.950 --> 17:45.116
T1 or better bandwidth outbound, a lot of our clients still don't have it.

17:45.176 --> 17:46.617
They're trying to download over a modem.

17:46.757 --> 17:51.723
And if you try and download a high-resolution file over even a 28.8 modem, it could take days.

17:52.464 --> 17:53.845
It's just not commercially viable.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.608
I had 25 newspaper clients that take a bi-weekly column.

17:56.989 --> 18:00.873
And would you believe, I mean, like Salt Lake City, for instance, is still on a 300-bod model.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.334
It's just not.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.757
Four minutes to do a thousand-word column.

18:04.777 --> 18:06.519
Yeah, imagine a 30-megabyte file.

18:06.539 --> 18:07.560
Yeah, it's amazing.

18:07.777 --> 18:12.443
You know, so today we're still finding that a lot of clients want their delivery to come on CD-ROM.

18:12.463 --> 18:13.184
It's just quicker.

18:13.204 --> 18:14.366
It's the overnight express.

18:14.406 --> 18:14.906
They've got it.

18:14.926 --> 18:16.588
They can, you know, deal with it right away.

18:16.628 --> 18:21.154
This is an area of the company that's really starting to ramp up.

18:21.335 --> 18:23.918
The business here is really only about a year and a half old.

18:24.439 --> 18:27.102
So we're just starting to get known in the industry.

18:27.122 --> 18:28.944
We've done a series of ad campaigns.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.607
We've done several direct mail efforts.

18:30.627 --> 18:34.191
And so we're starting to really, you know, kind of hit our stride in this market.

18:34.251 --> 18:35.573
Is the company profitable yet?

18:35.823 --> 18:40.809
Well, you know, we don't disclose revenues or figures of that sort because we're a private company.

18:41.270 --> 18:41.871
We're private.

18:42.451 --> 18:49.340
I will say that, you know, it's certainly our intent that these businesses succeed, and part of that success is being a profitable enterprise.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.282
But you should probably talk more with Doug about that.

18:51.322 --> 18:53.125
We can't really, you know, give you the specifics.

18:53.145 --> 18:53.505
No, I understand.

18:53.545 --> 18:55.167
A private company is a private company.

18:55.187 --> 19:02.296
Yeah, but these guys have a lot of varied backgrounds, a lot of direct sales, a lot of stock photo agency backgrounds, marketing backgrounds.

19:02.316 --> 19:03.838
Is the entire Betman archive

19:04.072 --> 19:07.156
Oh, heavens no, and it probably never will be.

19:07.176 --> 19:07.697
Probably never will be.

19:07.717 --> 19:10.560
You know, they've got between 16 and 20 million images.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.022
They don't even know what they have.

19:12.443 --> 19:24.758
Their core collection, the collection that they... There's Otto's collection, and then the UPI one... But I mean, of the 16 or 17, the collection that they use commercially is really only about 300,000 images out of the whole... Which is a lot, actually.

19:24.778 --> 19:27.241
That's a lot, but that's what they use.

19:27.301 --> 19:31.767
So we're going to start working with them, and we have already started working with them.

19:32.185 --> 19:41.862
to look at those 300,000 and see which of those need to be scanned first and then go beyond that into the areas where they may not have... And they are physically located in New York?

19:41.882 --> 19:42.363
In New York.

19:45.228 --> 19:47.593
Now this area back here is media development.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.935
This is Charles Massey's group.

19:49.376 --> 19:51.740
These are the folks that are actually building the archive.

19:52.141 --> 19:55.527
And the general editors along the wall here

19:56.435 --> 20:07.189
Their job is to go out and identify collections and partners, and they go out and work with photographers and museums, libraries, and public and private collections, and develop relationships.

20:07.910 --> 20:16.562
Once we get an agreement in place with a source provider for the archive, then the picture editors who are in the center here actually go in and work on the selections.

20:17.202 --> 20:22.189
Now, the agreements that we have with our sources are generally very long-term because we want to develop

20:22.473 --> 20:24.515
ongoing partnerships and relationships.

20:24.755 --> 20:28.298
And we work to a very strict editing criteria.

20:28.338 --> 20:37.345
So if we work with a photographer who has, say, two or three hundred thousand images in their collection, we may only partner with them for three or four thousand today.

20:37.726 --> 20:48.955
But then we want the ability to continue to work with them, and both as they develop new photography and also as market drives demand, we can continue to work with them to get those images in digital form.

20:50.076 --> 20:52.378
You used a very interesting phrase

20:52.763 --> 20:55.286
back in your office, non-exclusive rights.

20:55.506 --> 20:59.551
Yeah, primarily non-exclusive agreements are what we do.

20:59.951 --> 21:04.937
So therefore, you know, the picture of Winston Churchill would be for victory.

21:04.977 --> 21:10.163
I mean, it's possible to get that picture from other sources then, or is that how it might be?

21:10.203 --> 21:12.266
I don't know where that one came from, but that's the idea.

21:12.286 --> 21:20.475
A photographer that partners with us on a non-exclusive basis, we work with them to determine which images we want to digitize and put into the Corbis archive.

21:20.675 --> 21:29.104
The photographer is free to take those exact same images that we selected and sell them directly, sell them to other agencies, sell them to other digital agencies if they wish.

21:29.565 --> 21:31.106
It's truly non-exclusive.

21:31.126 --> 21:34.650
So we are a channel to market for that material.

21:34.811 --> 21:40.317
And the way that we're different from a stock agency is that we don't agent an entire photographer.

21:40.757 --> 21:45.282
We agent selected material from that photographer and from this one and from this one.

21:45.633 --> 21:48.097
So we're not really agenting entire collections.

21:48.117 --> 21:49.340
We're agenting selections.

21:49.660 --> 21:53.046
And these are largely one-time use agreements, I would imagine.

21:53.066 --> 21:56.412
That's what we've seen with the professional licensing side of the business.

21:56.712 --> 22:02.903
That's what we normally grant is a one-time use for a specific time period in a specific product for a specific fee.

22:03.384 --> 22:05.548
And then if you want to make a different use,

22:05.832 --> 22:07.715
negotiate a new fee based on that.

22:08.115 --> 22:11.200
And that all kicks back a royalty to the original source.

22:12.482 --> 22:26.642
It's a very elegant and simple kind of a setup, and it allows us to build a very broad collection that's very, very tightly edited, because we're working with each photographer to determine which of their material is best suited for this archive.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.273
And we're doing that across many, many sources.

22:29.313 --> 22:32.678
You don't end up with a lot of material that's not interesting or not usable.

22:32.698 --> 22:34.720
You're getting really high-quality material.

22:34.740 --> 22:43.873
And I would imagine that, obviously, for wonders of computers, you're able to maintain a base of, you know, frequency of use.

22:44.133 --> 22:44.794
Absolutely.

22:44.814 --> 22:45.234
Of images.

22:45.254 --> 22:45.555
Absolutely.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.457
And we're never out.

22:47.838 --> 22:51.943
And one of the other advantages over a stock agency is that we're never out.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.587
If a stock photo agency sends a print to one client,

22:54.736 --> 22:56.918
They can't send it to another client who might want it.

22:57.039 --> 22:58.780
But with a digital image, we're never out.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.806
We can send it to you and you and you and you, and you can all look at it at the same time and you decide what you want to do.

23:04.527 --> 23:07.550
So you're not running into some of the same problems you have.

23:07.570 --> 23:10.814
You also don't have the insurance liability of film and transparencies.

23:10.854 --> 23:20.004
When you license a transparency from someone and it's in your possession, if you damage it or lose it, they're usually insured for a good chunk of change.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.866
With a digital file, you can't hurt it.

23:22.006 --> 23:22.907
You can't lose it.

23:22.947 --> 23:23.848
You can't damage it.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.690
So you don't have to worry about those kinds of issues.

23:27.311 --> 23:32.520
So there's some benefits to digital that aren't necessarily obvious on the first block.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.085
Now these editors work very closely with the sources.

23:35.385 --> 23:43.038
We will either send an editor on site to do the selecting, or sometimes the source will do a first cut and send that material here, and then we'll edit from that.

23:43.118 --> 23:44.841
Could they be at home?

23:45.361 --> 23:47.824
similar to what I'm known in the publishing business.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.388
There's acquisitions, editors, kinds of issues.

23:50.848 --> 23:52.991
Well, we call them just picture editors.

23:53.892 --> 23:57.256
But their function is to go out and find suitable material.

23:58.178 --> 23:58.398
Right.

23:58.458 --> 24:00.080
I mean, they're developing collections.

24:00.541 --> 24:01.742
We call them media development.

24:02.603 --> 24:05.808
So there's still a place for going out into the real world.

24:06.128 --> 24:06.629
Oh, yeah.

24:06.649 --> 24:07.990
It's not all done from here, is it?

24:08.211 --> 24:13.798
No, the general editors are very involved in the photography community, in the museum community.

24:14.200 --> 24:21.450
You know, they're all the time taking calls from people who want to work with us as well as going out and looking and, you know, identifying.

24:21.490 --> 24:28.119
We have very much a structure for what we want in the archive, and Charles Mousy will tell you much more about that kind of plan.

24:28.860 --> 24:32.305
When you're talking about something of the scope, you've got to go about it sensibly.

24:32.325 --> 24:35.469
You can't just go out and say we want, you know, to document the world.

24:35.950 --> 24:43.600
What we've kind of done is similar to taking an encyclopedia and knocking out all the text so that you're left with headings and subheadings.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.198
And then we're filling that with images.

24:45.218 --> 24:50.206
We're trying to represent, encyclopedic in scope, kind of the human experience.

24:50.327 --> 24:52.150
And we're doing that across the world.

24:52.250 --> 24:56.256
So there is a map and a plan, and we have to prioritize.

24:56.336 --> 25:00.723
And so there's some logic to doing it that Charles can really explain, I think.

25:02.386 --> 25:09.077
So once the picture editors have done their selection, then this side of the room is our media catalog.

25:09.297 --> 25:10.279
And this is really...

25:11.322 --> 25:15.326
Of all the things that we do here at Corbison, this is the most fundamental and the most important.

25:15.767 --> 25:19.571
This is the thing that we have done very differently from anyone else.

25:20.131 --> 25:25.377
Every image that goes in the archive has extensive captioning and keywording attached to a lot of data.

25:25.697 --> 25:28.560
We've done years of research into search and navigation software.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.724
Because anybody these days can go out and buy a scanner and scan millions of images real quickly.

25:33.085 --> 25:33.645
Not a problem.

25:33.886 --> 25:35.187
But if you can't find the one you want,

25:35.521 --> 25:37.824
and you can't find it quickly and get it into a client's hand.

25:38.364 --> 25:38.905
No asset.

25:38.925 --> 25:48.336
So we've done a lot of thinking about how do you index an archive of this size and this breadth and make it accessible, and accessible for markets that we don't know yet.

25:48.376 --> 25:57.266
So accessible from everyone, from the person in their home to the professional user, who are all going to approach how they want to organize material in a very different way.

25:57.326 --> 26:03.013
So we've had to develop very flexible systems for indexing and cataloging that will service all those markets.

26:03.230 --> 26:10.346
It's something that a lot of people have expressed interest in, but we're not really in the business of developing tools and selling them.

26:10.386 --> 26:13.893
This was a tool that we developed to help us manage this collection.

26:14.475 --> 26:22.352
It's not something we're interested in marketing because then you have all the support issues and the upgrade issues, and it's a very different skill set than what we have here.

26:22.906 --> 26:25.689
This group is the largest devotion of headcount in the company.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.431
It's also our largest area of investment.

26:27.531 --> 26:30.154
What do you mean by explain that?

26:30.494 --> 26:31.355
The largest headcount.

26:31.375 --> 26:34.078
There's more people in this department than in any other department.

26:34.238 --> 26:36.481
And that would be how many approximately?

26:37.442 --> 26:38.943
I don't know all told.

26:39.003 --> 26:43.929
This group here is over 32 or 33 people in Bellevue.

26:44.029 --> 26:46.652
There's also cataloging going on in our other locations.

26:46.732 --> 26:48.694
I'm not sure what the total is.

26:49.012 --> 26:56.165
But it's definitely much larger than any other single group here at Corbis because this is really fundamental to what we do.

26:56.205 --> 27:01.253
We work with the sources, the museum curators and the photographers, to get data and captioning.

27:01.273 --> 27:02.776
We also do a lot of our own research.

27:03.377 --> 27:07.725
So we spend a great deal of time with each image making sure that we've captioned it carefully.

27:07.885 --> 27:13.635
We have a person in-house that's devoted to building a thesaurus and a controlled vocabulary that we use.

27:13.902 --> 27:18.698
We looked at existing academic standards for indexing, and we took it to the next level for multimedia.

27:19.079 --> 27:23.393
And we've really worked at trying to make that unique.

27:23.594 --> 27:25.279
And it's something very important for us.

27:25.546 --> 27:30.652
We have people here, many of them are PhD candidates in library science and social science.

27:30.672 --> 27:33.055
You're just reading my mind, and I was asking what their background is.

27:33.075 --> 27:34.536
Oh, they're very, very diverse.

27:34.556 --> 27:38.220
We have advanced degrees in history and art history and science.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.602
You absolutely anticipated my next question.

27:39.622 --> 27:42.646
I was wondering if they're all computer people or they have scholarly baggage.

27:42.686 --> 27:47.051
That's what is so funny, because so many people perceive Corvus as a technology company.

27:47.111 --> 27:49.313
If Bill owns it, it's got to be a technology company.

27:51.115 --> 27:54.439
Less than 10% of our staff is what you would truly consider...

27:54.942 --> 27:59.807
technology like C++ and Visual Basic programmers, less than 10% of the total staff.

28:00.267 --> 28:22.971
The bulk of it is in people with, you know, these advanced degrees and different specialties, photography backgrounds, you know, fine arts and liberal arts backgrounds, marketing, the creative side, design, and in the product development side, there's a lot of, you know, film backgrounds and design backgrounds, and it's a very different skill set than people would get knowing about the company.

28:22.991 --> 28:24.072
So who puts together the team?

28:24.862 --> 28:30.355
Each department manager, I mean Charles certainly fills out his media development team.

28:30.415 --> 28:33.944
Curtis was instrumental in building the product team.

28:34.004 --> 28:37.673
So there's, these guys look very carefully.

28:38.159 --> 28:41.422
You've got a lot more floor space than each of you guys.

28:41.643 --> 28:42.904
Oh, it's a warrant.

28:42.924 --> 28:44.485
It has all these little corridors.

28:46.007 --> 28:50.431
Reminds me of my old aircraft carrier, which is over in Blemerton, I think, and those mothballs.

28:50.451 --> 28:53.314
I actually personally think it's very inefficient use of space.

28:53.394 --> 28:57.378
I think we could do a lot better than what we've done here.

28:59.661 --> 29:01.282
This is our English processing lab.

29:01.302 --> 29:02.283
We'll start you over here.

29:02.404 --> 29:02.884
Okay.

29:03.809 --> 29:08.074
This is probably the most high-tech area that you'll see in the company.

29:08.935 --> 29:10.817
There are scanning labs here.

29:10.838 --> 29:12.820
We have six scanners.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.902
We use primarily Scitex equipment.

29:15.303 --> 29:18.467
They're a very high-end scanning equipment operator.

29:19.007 --> 29:24.314
We are one of the few sites, I think, in the world that has as many Scitexes as we do.

29:24.334 --> 29:25.836
We've got six in this room.

29:25.856 --> 29:27.498
How do you spell Scitex?

29:27.518 --> 29:27.758
S-C-I-T-E-X.

29:28.025 --> 29:33.132
That's one of the constant struggles.

29:33.152 --> 29:34.394
That's why it's so cool in here.

29:35.015 --> 29:37.879
It's keeping dust off of the film as we scan it.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.462
Psytex is an Israeli based company.

29:40.843 --> 29:46.270
They are best known for equipment they've done in the print pre-press world and we're one of their first partners in

29:46.503 --> 29:47.985
all digital processing.

29:48.005 --> 29:50.769
They've done some amazing work with these scanners.

29:50.949 --> 29:58.238
We get a very high-quality file at a very good throughput rate, so we're able to scan a goodly amount of material here.

29:59.320 --> 30:06.750
We scan all formats, everything from 35mm to 2x2s, 4x5s, up to odd-sized prints.

30:06.770 --> 30:10.915
We've had things like glass plate negatives that we've then had to go to transparency film.

30:11.316 --> 30:13.118
We deal with all kinds of formats.

30:13.705 --> 30:19.352
These operators have a lot of print prepress and photography and color management backgrounds.

30:19.372 --> 30:21.075
Each scanner, they'll load up the scanners.

30:21.135 --> 30:23.478
So that's the scanner right there, right?

30:23.538 --> 30:25.000
There's a cartridge that goes in.

30:25.020 --> 30:30.267
These are the cartridges that are loaded into the scanners.

30:30.427 --> 30:36.535
Depending on the size of what sort of film we're using, you'll load it up appropriately.

30:36.555 --> 30:38.137
This would be for 35 millimeters.

30:38.177 --> 30:41.181
We have little sleeves that'll work for many sizes.

30:41.414 --> 30:46.868
you load those into the scanners here and then it'll go through and do a pre-scan and bring up

30:47.050 --> 31:08.111
You know, the initial image.

31:08.131 --> 31:10.353
They're also attached to flatbeds, so if you do have an oversized print or something, you can use the flatbeds.

31:10.373 --> 31:11.675
If you don't mind, may I take a couple of shots?

31:11.695 --> 31:12.495
Have you ever taken any of those slides?

31:12.515 --> 31:12.656
Mm-hmm.

31:12.676 --> 31:13.116
Yeah, we do have some.

31:13.136 --> 31:13.456
Yeah, it's good.

31:13.476 --> 31:13.897
They're professional.

31:13.917 --> 31:15.418
Why don't you take a lot of them if they don't know where you come back?

31:15.438 --> 31:15.779
No, that's good.

31:15.799 --> 31:17.040
You know, these are just important when I'm coming to writing.

31:17.020 --> 31:45.036
If there's any real obvious

31:45.016 --> 32:04.662
cast to the image or color cast to the image or color cast to the image or color cast to the image.

32:05.131 --> 32:14.604
So what they do on this side, then, is they get the original, put it on a light box, pull up the digital file, and they do an optical correct.

32:14.624 --> 32:19.651
They'll remove any dust that's been put in during the scanning process and the scanning cloud.

32:19.671 --> 32:23.476
And they'll correct this screen image to look as close as possible to the original.

32:24.137 --> 32:33.670
Now, that screen image is saved, optimized, and that becomes almost your digital proof.

32:34.223 --> 32:37.070
that's the one that has the color that's optimized.

32:37.090 --> 32:50.545
The large raw file is saved untouched so that if you are a book publisher and your printer has a particular way of doing color, we'll give you the raw file that has the most data possible and then we'll give you the color proof that shows you what

32:50.525 --> 32:54.854
what the original looked like, and then your printer determines how to best map that.

32:54.874 --> 32:56.196
And at what point does it go to file?

32:56.236 --> 32:58.421
Does an individual pass on it?

32:58.701 --> 33:03.892
Yeah, well, these individual processors, that's their job is to do the quality control.

33:03.912 --> 33:07.960
They have a lot of, again, prepress background photography and color management background.

33:08.480 --> 33:15.390
They'll save that screen image, which is the 1024 or thereabouts, to the servers, and that's what we all can access from our devcast.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.453
1024, that's where I've gotten right to see, but believe me or not.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.495
Yeah, pretty close.

33:18.515 --> 33:23.582
And that's also what our clients do when we send out preview images for them to look.

33:23.682 --> 33:27.788
You know, they've got either 640 by 480 or thereabouts or the 1024.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.757
That's what our clients will see.

33:29.938 --> 33:35.370
The raw files are saved back to a combination of magnetic and digital tape.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.114
We make three copies of each image.

33:37.395 --> 33:43.388
One goes off-site into a fire-safe area, one goes to our London office, and then one is kept here for retrieval.

33:44.150 --> 33:46.556
So they are archival copies, so to speak.

33:46.696 --> 33:47.177
Oh, yeah.

33:47.377 --> 33:51.743
Yeah, and there's a version in London and a version here and a version off-site.

33:51.884 --> 33:53.386
We're backed up to the 9th.

33:53.606 --> 33:56.010
Plus there's redundant systems throughout for this.

33:56.210 --> 34:00.877
So a major computer crash isn't going to destroy the whole... No, no.

34:01.518 --> 34:03.741
That would be foolishness to allow something like that.

34:04.402 --> 34:08.929
And the thing is, too, that these digital files...

34:10.529 --> 34:16.606
Even just those, the 800,000 or so that are at screen resolution, we're getting up into terabytes of data.

34:16.747 --> 34:21.400
If you look at the large raw files that are anywhere from 20 to 35 megabytes per image,

34:21.869 --> 34:27.354
There are no server systems at this point that could manage that kind of data quickly over an Internet.

34:27.374 --> 34:33.120
So we're working, one of the areas we're still doing a lot of our research and development in is in image management.

34:33.220 --> 34:39.826
How do you take large files, not lose any data through compression, and still get them moving very quickly around?

34:40.266 --> 34:45.051
Just to give me an idea of what he's doing here now, this image is coming, where is that coming from?

34:45.091 --> 34:46.232
This image is scanned.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.615
This is coming off the server because these are,

34:50.168 --> 34:51.670
These are called brick hard drives.

34:51.770 --> 34:53.834
This is a one gigabyte drive.

34:54.274 --> 34:56.918
When the scanners do the scan, they load the images on here.

34:56.998 --> 35:02.026
These come over here for optimizing and quality control, and then they're loaded onto materials.

35:03.408 --> 35:12.682
So this image is this one here, and they'll crop out the image mount if the image mount shows, so we'll move any dust if there's dust.

35:12.742 --> 35:16.648
See, actually, that's just a digital picture of the whole

35:17.472 --> 35:20.860
The whole unit, the whole... It's a digital picture of this slide.

35:21.101 --> 35:25.312
Yeah, but this other stuff on the outside, isn't that... That's just the viewer.

35:25.352 --> 35:28.680
I'm saying it took the whole viewer, and he's going to have to edit out this.

35:28.998 --> 35:31.081
the superfluous stuff going around.

35:31.181 --> 35:33.464
Right, because you can see the rough edge.

35:33.504 --> 35:36.107
That's actually the cardboard image mount that was scanned.

35:36.348 --> 35:38.190
Will he be able to correct that digitally?

35:38.210 --> 35:39.011
Yeah, he'll crop that out.

35:39.412 --> 35:46.341
He'll make sure that the image is clean and there's no dust because no matter how we try and fight dust in here, there's always something.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.285
What if there's a scratch on the original negative?

35:49.265 --> 35:52.670
If there's a scratch or something, they can fix that.

35:52.790 --> 35:56.094
We're very cautious about trying to change the image.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.140
What we're trying to do is represent that photograph as best as possible.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.164
For instance, we have Matthew Brady's Civil War photos.

36:03.544 --> 36:05.507
You're anticipating where I'm going.

36:05.947 --> 36:07.850
Those brown spots are part of the character.

36:08.331 --> 36:09.392
We wouldn't remove those.

36:09.632 --> 36:11.054
We wouldn't try and pretty it up.

36:11.154 --> 36:15.500
Now, if it's a scratch in the film of something like this, we can do that.

36:15.621 --> 36:17.483
We have often worked with the source.

36:17.800 --> 36:25.350
the photographer or the curator to determine, is this something that was a spot on the film or is this something that was a spot on the original?

36:26.371 --> 36:27.833
And we work very closely with that.

36:27.913 --> 36:30.897
We're not in the business of trying to alter the image.

36:30.917 --> 36:34.261
We're trying to make it look as close as possible to the photograph.

36:34.461 --> 36:40.028
Now, thinking in terms of Ansel Adams, who I interviewed, by the way, years ago in 1979, had wonderful...

36:40.632 --> 36:41.413
regard for him.

36:41.453 --> 36:44.116
He made all of his own prints.

36:44.136 --> 36:47.079
Everyone was different from, they were unique, basically.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.242
And those prints were very different from the original negative.

36:49.262 --> 36:49.882
That's correct.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.105
So what are you digitizing?

36:52.445 --> 36:55.168
A standard print off the negative, off the negative?

36:55.549 --> 36:57.331
We're working very closely with the truck.

36:57.351 --> 37:00.414
I don't know, if you interviewed Ansel Adams, did you talk with Andrea Stillman?

37:00.434 --> 37:01.075
No, I didn't.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.777
This was about 79 when I did this.

37:02.797 --> 37:06.902
Andrea was his darkroom assistant, a very close friend, and she's working with us.

37:06.942 --> 37:08.884
She's the Ansel Adams Trust.

37:08.982 --> 37:09.783
I know who she is.

37:09.823 --> 37:10.223
Image specialist.

37:10.324 --> 37:12.546
She's come here a number of times, and we're working with her.

37:12.606 --> 37:13.828
We're scanning off of print.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.050
Made by whom?

37:16.251 --> 37:17.432
I believe they're made by Ansel.

37:17.452 --> 37:17.592
Okay.

37:17.632 --> 37:21.377
We're working directly with the Trust to get the best quality scans.

37:21.737 --> 37:25.522
Print's made by Ansel, which is very important because he was his own darkroom man.

37:25.782 --> 37:26.303
Right, right.

37:26.443 --> 37:27.184
Well, he had help.

37:27.204 --> 37:30.127
I mean, Andrea was one of his assistants in the darkroom and worked with him.

37:30.147 --> 37:33.572
So she's working very closely with us to make sure that we get the patient.

37:33.592 --> 37:36.475
That's a very interesting question, isn't it?

37:37.585 --> 37:40.208
Curtis is another one to talk to about Ansel.

37:40.268 --> 37:42.030
He's worked very closely with the Trust.

37:42.050 --> 37:47.155
We're actually working on a CD-ROM of Ansel's life for 1997, and that was Curtis's project.

37:48.357 --> 37:50.940
He was very involved in that.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.661
So we take great care with it.

37:52.962 --> 37:56.446
One of the things that we have to do is maintain the integrity of the image.

37:56.506 --> 38:05.095
We're representing this material on behalf of the museums and the photographers, and we need to recognize that a photograph often

38:06.121 --> 38:09.325
reflects reality only to the extent a photographer wished it to.

38:09.405 --> 38:12.369
Many photographers have a style about the photography.

38:12.429 --> 38:13.711
We don't want to change that.

38:13.751 --> 38:14.793
We want to capture that.

38:14.913 --> 38:22.783
So if a photographer, you know, has done something with the color and the producing of their print, you know, we try and capture that as well.

38:22.843 --> 38:25.227
That especially applies to somebody like Ansel.

38:25.247 --> 38:25.607
Of course.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.251
Because the original image was just the beginning.

38:28.411 --> 38:28.872
Exactly.

38:29.532 --> 38:33.698
He actually made an analogy that Curtis might mention too that I think is wonderful, where the negative...

38:34.083 --> 38:37.208
was really the score, as if it were music.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.851
That's the actual score to the music.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.934
The print was the performance.

38:42.056 --> 38:44.900
The score is interpreted through the performance.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.222
That's excellent.

38:46.563 --> 38:51.751
His theory was visualization, to really visualize precisely what it looked like.

38:51.771 --> 38:54.055
That's why he shot very few... Exactly.

38:54.115 --> 38:56.399
He didn't shoot 100 shots to get one.

38:56.839 --> 38:59.323
Yeah, he would wait all day to get the one.

38:59.343 --> 39:00.445
To get the one.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.802
the way he wanted it.

39:02.122 --> 39:04.346
He's a wonderful photographer.

39:04.386 --> 39:05.908
This is our technology group here.

39:06.148 --> 39:09.894
This is the area of the company where we are still very involved in research and development.

39:10.555 --> 39:14.560
As I said, this is a relatively small group proportionally to the other division.

39:15.061 --> 39:27.900
They're doing a lot of work in advanced imaging techniques, image management, like moving lots of data very quickly, image protection, things like encryption and watermarking, and how do we make sure the material is secure on the net.

39:28.302 --> 39:36.692
Things like search and navigation software and how do you get a software that can search through millions of images very quickly and get the ones you want.

39:37.293 --> 39:48.025
So there's a lot of really bright minds here doing a lot of research into those areas as well as helping us build our products and our website and do some of the nuts and bolts technology development.

39:49.006 --> 39:58.157
If you in fact have some professional shot photographs that I can have and I can leave my camera in your office when we get there.

39:58.475 --> 40:06.638
I use them to help me to recall scenes and how they looked and a lot of my images.

40:07.079 --> 40:13.497
This is getting into our accounting, finance, human resources, all the administrative stuff.

40:14.185 --> 40:16.008
Oh, I can see this workforce now.

40:16.108 --> 40:17.831
I didn't see it when I was sitting in your office.

40:17.911 --> 40:18.912
It wasn't apparent.

40:19.013 --> 40:22.939
With a company of its size, we've got to have HR people and accountants.

40:22.999 --> 40:26.805
We've got revenues coming in from both the businesses.

40:26.845 --> 40:28.447
We have contracts going in and out.

40:28.507 --> 40:29.930
This is getting into legal here.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.752
We have three attorneys on staff.

40:33.595 --> 40:38.022
One of them is kind of more towards the inbound contract agreements with our source partners.

40:38.062 --> 40:41.728
One is more focused on the outbound licensing agreements with our clients.

40:42.029 --> 40:50.512
And then one of them is Steve Davis, who's our VP of Strategic and Legal Affairs, and he doesn't really function as much as an attorney, as just kind of overseeing the group.

40:52.057 --> 40:57.692
We speak internationally on issues around digital copyright and how

40:58.128 --> 41:02.915
how this digital medium is affecting the rights of the creative producers.

41:03.636 --> 41:10.745
We're uniquely positioned because on the one hand, we're working very closely with the creative community, the photographers and the museums.

41:10.765 --> 41:13.850
On the other hand, we're also working closely with business communities and publishers.

41:14.250 --> 41:23.443
And we're able to kind of inform the debate a little bit and help people understand what the technology can do and also what it can't do.

41:23.643 --> 41:28.367
are legitimate risks, and the things that are just kind of fear the unknown hype sort of thing.

41:28.447 --> 41:31.250
So we're really, I think, uniquely positioned in that regard.

41:31.831 --> 41:33.873
So really we walk in a big circle with what we do.

41:34.413 --> 41:35.914
I know.

41:37.896 --> 41:38.257
Okay.

41:39.278 --> 41:41.079
We're just doing this for ourselves.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.621
I'm just going to drop this hammer in here.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.182
Excuse me.

41:44.242 --> 41:52.570
I just want to dump this over here.

41:53.343 --> 42:02.233
I guess I got a voicemail from AMH that they were madly trying to hunt you down earlier today.

42:04.075 --> 42:09.401
This is our product development group, which actually when you meet with Curtis, maybe we'll go down at that point so we can see some of the products.

42:14.066 --> 42:15.027
A big donut.

42:15.047 --> 42:16.228
I like that.

42:18.048 --> 42:19.976
Hi, Charles.

42:20.257 --> 42:21.582
Pleasure to meet you.

42:21.602 --> 42:22.406
Pleasure to meet you.

42:22.446 --> 42:24.936
Thank you for seeing us.
