00:02.714 --> 00:05.376
Diana, what is this here?

00:05.396 --> 00:06.978
These are boxes of crayons.

00:06.998 --> 00:10.040
I don't know if you ever saw these, Nancy.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.562
I thought it was stacked away in my studio.

00:13.083 --> 00:17.727
But these are plain crayons and sort of the history of the evolution of the crayon.

00:17.747 --> 00:21.810
The crayon, this could in itself be a whole interesting subject.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.512
It's not the thing I've looked into.

00:24.112 --> 00:29.537
But wax crayons started being made around 1900.

00:30.037 --> 00:32.299
And then there's this whole evolution of

00:32.752 --> 00:40.040
color systems for crayons and... So what do you have here, Diane?

00:40.060 --> 00:41.982
What would you say you have here that we're looking at?

00:42.302 --> 00:42.822
Right now?

00:42.882 --> 00:44.384
Yeah, what's here in terms of crayons?

00:44.404 --> 00:46.887
I haven't even looked at them since I brought them back.

00:46.907 --> 00:48.949
In terms of numbers, what would you say you have here?

00:49.089 --> 00:53.113
I don't know, but I'll tell you that when I've done it.

00:53.213 --> 00:59.940
I mean, I'm literally bringing things down from the... I feel a little self-conscious about this because there's a lot...

01:00.207 --> 01:07.936
I know very well that I have, and there's a lot that I sort of put in the attic, and I thought, someday it'll all go together.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.879
But I've never counted how many these are.

01:10.939 --> 01:18.127
But I would say we're looking at five plastic boxes filled with crayons, some of which might be as much as 90 or so years old.

01:18.168 --> 01:19.769
Is that what you're saying?

01:20.270 --> 01:20.430
Exactly.

01:20.450 --> 01:21.151
In their original.

01:21.171 --> 01:22.372
In their original.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.797
And the thing that's so interesting is, like, this is Prang Company.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.640
Louis Prang, you know, that whole history.

01:29.080 --> 01:29.961
And look at that.

01:30.329 --> 01:31.770
pretty good condition.

01:32.011 --> 01:34.393
You get all the chromolithographs in Boston, yeah.

01:34.413 --> 01:35.334
Yeah.

01:35.354 --> 01:43.162
And there are a huge number of drawing instruction books that are his that are here, which I'll show you when we get in.

01:43.483 --> 01:47.387
So it's a very interdependent collection.

01:47.647 --> 01:49.669
I mean, this is quite remarkable.

01:49.749 --> 01:54.614
Is this the one I want to... You know the name Albert Munsell?

01:56.176 --> 01:56.316
No.

01:56.857 --> 01:58.678
Here, right down.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.239
Yeah.

01:59.472 --> 02:18.509
The Munsell color system, which was developed actually here in Boston, and these are Munsell crayons based on that color system, which was a whole theory that is different than... This is actually... That's M-U-N-S-E-L-L.

02:18.589 --> 02:20.551
Munsell crayons, Boston Mass.

02:20.591 --> 02:21.892
This looks very old.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.556
This is probably from the beginning of the 20th century.

02:27.597 --> 02:28.298
But the thing...

02:28.750 --> 02:30.692
I love telling stories.

02:31.774 --> 02:56.783
I, when Drone to Art came out, which I told you about, that's my first book, a man heard me interviewed on the radio, and he called me, I don't know if I ever told you, but I can't remember his name yet, he was quite elderly, he had been to art school at RISD when he was a young man, he was from Bedford, poor fellow who somehow got a scholarship

02:57.151 --> 03:04.280
And one thing led to another, and he became a scientist and was on the Apollo mission.

03:05.562 --> 03:22.703
And his claim was his education in Micell color system from when he was young became the NASA system for describing color, which is the standard description of color recording in space.

03:23.476 --> 03:25.499
So that, I love that story.

03:25.719 --> 03:29.604
I don't know if it's true or not, but he did tell it to me.

03:29.644 --> 03:44.044
And I see these things as having histories that have influence far beyond what you first think, you know, of children with wax crayons.

03:44.885 --> 03:45.806
These are much newer.

03:45.866 --> 03:51.214
These are sort of from the time of my own childhood.

03:51.234 --> 03:52.335
See, what happened...

03:52.923 --> 03:55.746
I was doing this for a long time.

03:55.826 --> 04:01.511
These are early Crayolas before the box looked like the box you know.

04:01.651 --> 04:02.952
I just want to write down some of the names.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.937
So is this the precursor to the modern age?

04:07.957 --> 04:08.437
Crayola.

04:08.457 --> 04:08.657
Yeah.

04:13.081 --> 04:14.663
Where was the crayon invented?

04:14.683 --> 04:16.925
Is that an American... I think so.

04:17.485 --> 04:21.108
I think it was... Well, I'm not sure.

04:21.148 --> 04:22.930
I'm not sure.

04:23.348 --> 04:52.798
what happens is you have a lot of things companies suddenly doing the same thing at the same time and so i don't know um who gets credited for it um how did these how does this come into the collection i mean okay that's what i that was the thought that i had lost um i had been teaching course at math art on the history of american art education i'd been going to flea markets to

04:53.048 --> 04:54.550
get all kinds of stuff.

04:57.314 --> 05:16.643
And in the process, one of my students, who was married to a bookseller up at Salem, told me that he cleaned out all the books and I could buy whatever was left.

05:16.842 --> 05:23.773
And this woman, I am starting to feel as I go through all this again, that she really was a soulmate.

05:23.853 --> 05:26.878
I mean, she is very much part of this collection.

05:27.418 --> 05:29.221
Her name was Mabel Spofford.

05:29.281 --> 05:36.412
She was the art director for the town of Gloucester, Mass., for the public schools.

05:36.913 --> 05:41.280
And she really was, she saved all this.

05:41.564 --> 05:52.919
I mean, I bought some of the crayons, but she saved the history of the actual sample materials that came to her when she... In a teaching position.

05:52.939 --> 05:53.439
Yeah.

05:53.459 --> 05:54.941
And did she keep them in this condition?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.585
Because it seems to be in pretty spectacular condition.

05:57.605 --> 05:58.766
Yeah, yeah.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.569
So she knew she was preserving artifacts.

06:00.589 --> 06:03.633
She, I think, was brilliant, yeah.

06:03.753 --> 06:10.862
She... The more I look at this stuff, I think, what was this maiden lady doing up there in Foster Master?

06:11.315 --> 06:39.246
mean she took every course i just found this morning she took a cartooning course and she didn't just take it to teach the kids how to do it she took it to learn how to be a cartoonist in the 20s so it's a very interesting um insight into a female aspiration because this woman had to be very ambitious to have thought about

06:39.445 --> 06:40.967
Saved, taken, notes.

06:41.127 --> 06:43.972
I have all that stuff over there.

06:43.992 --> 06:45.954
A bunch of that stuff.

06:45.994 --> 06:47.857
That is not going to the Huntington's.

06:48.378 --> 06:50.761
That probably is going to Mass Art, Nancy.

06:50.962 --> 06:52.444
That's what ESC teaches.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.768
I'm not sure about the crayons yet.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.530
They're not books.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.012
How would you classify them?

06:58.032 --> 07:00.395
Well, Huntington wants all of it.

07:02.138 --> 07:04.020
That chair, folks?

07:04.040 --> 07:07.425
Those are coloring books.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.368
Hardbound coloring books.

07:09.787 --> 07:13.671
And I called them the other day and I said, do you really want these coloring books?

07:14.051 --> 07:15.833
And they said, absolutely.

07:16.574 --> 07:28.066
And you know, it's very, I know what interests me about them, but knowing what they own, it's very odd to think about these things moving into that collection.

07:28.527 --> 07:31.870
But what's happening is you ask about what the Huntington's going to do.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.953
Some of it goes to seal all those books in there.

07:35.954 --> 07:36.555
Oh, my goodness.

07:36.575 --> 07:36.655
Wow.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.325
Much of those books will go into the Huntington Library.

07:41.046 --> 07:46.575
And then the museum, they've just built an American Art Museum there 15 years ago or so, I think.

07:47.336 --> 07:52.785
And they have archival storage there for the 3D objects.

07:52.945 --> 07:57.632
They have 3D objects as well.

07:57.773 --> 07:59.255
And then these boxes and stuff.

07:59.275 --> 08:03.722
There are a lot of things I will walk you through.

08:04.613 --> 08:06.736
But they want it all.

08:08.599 --> 08:09.099
No surprise.

08:09.159 --> 08:10.341
Are they coming out to get it?

08:10.762 --> 08:12.324
Are they sending someone?

08:13.225 --> 08:19.274
The company that introduced me to them is doing the shipping and packing and shipping.

08:19.294 --> 08:19.574
I see.

08:20.976 --> 08:25.583
And that will happen on Thursday.

08:25.603 --> 08:27.045
Oh my goodness.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.968
I keep saying the house is going to be out there.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.151
Who's handling this on the Huntington side?

08:31.631 --> 08:32.372
Amy, oh yes.

08:32.633 --> 08:33.574
Amy Meyer.

08:34.415 --> 08:37.239
who is the American art curator.

08:37.259 --> 08:37.800
Do you know her?

08:38.301 --> 08:39.983
I don't.

08:40.003 --> 08:44.930
She is the most high energy, bright soul.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.332
So she's on the art museum side.

08:46.352 --> 08:48.415
She is the curator on the museum side.

08:49.376 --> 08:56.847
And then, I can't remember the name now, but there are a couple of staff people on the book side, in the library side.

08:56.867 --> 09:01.574
The chief of rare books is very interested in this collection.

09:01.954 --> 09:03.156
And then there's some...

09:03.760 --> 09:05.862
You might know the name.

09:05.902 --> 09:06.523
Yes.

09:06.783 --> 09:13.930
He's apparently nuts about the manuals and the sort of social history and instructional materials.

09:14.391 --> 09:15.231
I've never met him.

09:15.292 --> 09:16.052
Nice man.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.074
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

09:18.134 --> 09:21.618
They have a wonderful chemistry there.

09:21.958 --> 09:26.963
When we went out there, I was sort of sizing up where this should go.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.747
And they had a meeting of about seven people.

09:30.980 --> 09:38.428
all who had been primed about what this was, and all who had their own perspective on what they could do with it.

09:39.549 --> 09:40.209
That's extraordinary.

09:40.229 --> 09:40.570
Yeah.

09:40.590 --> 09:48.298
So Diana, this mostly came from one woman out of... These crayon things are pretty much the Gloucester person.

09:48.318 --> 09:48.778
That's great.

09:48.978 --> 09:50.560
What a trove that is.

09:51.701 --> 09:56.526
I really, I couldn't believe it when I said, can you imagine?

09:58.188 --> 09:59.569
And she just was,

09:59.937 --> 10:02.319
It was everything.

10:02.499 --> 10:04.581
I mean, what did she think she was doing?

10:04.721 --> 10:15.730
I mean, now I feel a very strong need to tell people about her because she's like my partner in this, you know.

10:16.851 --> 10:20.414
Had you been collecting any of this?

10:21.976 --> 10:22.716
Yeah, I had some.

10:22.736 --> 10:25.919
This was one of my favorite materials when I was a kid.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.522
And so I probably bought that.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.101
For that reason.

10:32.283 --> 10:32.883
Not at all.

10:32.904 --> 10:34.405
No, I'm positive.

10:34.425 --> 10:44.397
I could give you more light.

10:44.837 --> 10:45.979
No, I could.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.400
I could.

10:47.701 --> 10:48.521
I could.

10:48.622 --> 10:50.664
I could.

10:50.864 --> 10:51.265
I could.

10:51.285 --> 10:51.825
I could.

10:51.945 --> 10:52.506
I could.

10:52.646 --> 10:53.367
I could.

11:06.610 --> 11:11.918
Before your other guests come, can I take pictures of you or some of these things?

11:12.378 --> 11:18.988
I don't want to get in the way of it.

11:19.909 --> 11:20.831
I'll just walk you quickly.

11:20.971 --> 11:24.856
You can stay late.

11:24.876 --> 11:31.546
Oh, thank you very much.

11:31.766 --> 11:31.947
Hello.

11:31.967 --> 11:35.672
In this collection of these

11:36.648 --> 11:55.433
I don't want to get into talking about them too much because there are connections between things I'd like to make, but these are all drawing kits, slates that children would have drawn on, stencils.

11:56.634 --> 12:02.041
In fact, it's interesting how many of these things have... Could you open this door just a tad so we can get out?

12:02.162 --> 12:03.003
It swings.

12:03.543 --> 12:06.267
It may swing like that.

12:07.073 --> 12:11.920
How about if it came out just like that?

12:11.940 --> 12:12.641
That's a great idea.

12:13.763 --> 12:19.351
I'd like to get a picture of you in there, too, discussing it a little bit, if that's all right.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.372
That's great.

12:20.393 --> 12:20.833
Go ahead.

12:20.893 --> 12:22.235
You can just continue talking.

12:22.255 --> 12:22.896
I just saw this.

12:23.757 --> 12:27.463
I reached for my favorite things.

12:27.543 --> 12:29.326
These are like my toy collections.

12:29.566 --> 12:33.331
And this is a funny little guy I don't know much about.

12:33.351 --> 12:36.456
A little animated figure of metal.

12:40.148 --> 12:45.376
It's okay, I'm just... Great, thanks.

12:46.397 --> 12:48.300
Don't even think about it.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.562
Something to drink.

12:50.323 --> 12:52.906
Just cold or something?

12:52.967 --> 12:53.167
No.

12:53.427 --> 12:53.668
Okay.

12:54.108 --> 12:57.553
It is very hot in there.

12:58.715 --> 13:01.339
It's quite nice, actually.

13:02.040 --> 13:08.569
It looks like...

13:09.258 --> 13:35.350
yes it is i meant to mention that to you this house has in itself i mean i i flipped over this house because of this library but the house has a very interesting history um the wood carver who did the seashell over the door and all this stuff bill this house was built for

13:35.583 --> 13:36.364
His daughter.

13:37.747 --> 13:41.713
And you know the reading room?

13:41.974 --> 13:48.584
It's called the Robin's Reading Room, and the Ellington Public Library.

13:48.725 --> 13:50.688
Most exquisitely tired.

13:50.808 --> 13:51.469
You know that?

13:51.609 --> 13:52.871
I didn't know that.

13:53.072 --> 13:54.314
Just by this guy.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.356
I didn't realize that.

13:56.117 --> 14:00.544
And there were all sorts of people connections.

14:00.845 --> 14:25.217
There were some paintings that came with this house that were by Friends of New Cross who I wrote about.

14:25.958 --> 14:28.742
Everything leads to everything else, you know?

14:29.819 --> 14:33.044
These people who sold up the house.

14:34.446 --> 14:34.887
Nothing.

14:37.270 --> 14:37.370
Hi.

14:38.432 --> 14:39.373
Welcome.

14:39.393 --> 14:41.156
Diana, this room is really wonderful.

14:42.198 --> 14:47.886
When I saw this, it took me one second to say we've got to have the house.

14:48.367 --> 14:59.083
And the crazy thing is that the people who were selling it, as you will be going through this process yourself or are, you have such a wonderful house.

14:59.705 --> 15:07.636
The people who were selling this house had lived in here like curators of the house, and they changed nothing.

15:07.716 --> 15:16.367
We had to make some changes, but they were looking for people who would have a historical tie-in to this place and keep it that way.

15:16.387 --> 15:18.490
And when I saw this,

15:19.094 --> 15:37.917
I feel a little bit like a broken record.

15:38.298 --> 15:45.827
What happened is that about a month ago, I became very aware of how

15:46.027 --> 15:51.033
much I wanted people on the East Coast to know this collection before it left.

15:52.054 --> 16:01.606
I have been quite secretive about it over the years, to do with my personality probably, and many things.

16:01.706 --> 16:06.432
I just went to flea markets for years and bought these funny little things

16:06.783 --> 16:15.676
And I taught, as you all know, I think, a course on the history of art education, which I basically have to put together.

16:16.216 --> 16:27.913
But anyway, I would bring in these objects to show them to students, and I would make exercises based on them sometimes.

16:28.737 --> 16:32.641
adding to it, and I lived in a much smaller house than this.

16:33.162 --> 16:35.484
I just couldn't believe the other day I saw it.

16:35.504 --> 16:36.906
Did you have all this stuff in that house?

16:36.986 --> 16:39.468
Yeah, where was it?

16:39.488 --> 16:42.712
I can hardly picture it anymore in that house.

16:42.732 --> 16:54.424
But anyway, I decided that it was time for this collection to find a devoted patron.

16:55.923 --> 17:12.902
and um i found that patron in the huntington and um i couldn't believe how much the people there seem to understand the potential of this collection and um so

17:14.182 --> 17:20.931
Then, in order to get it ready to go, the books I had catalogued when I acquired them.

17:20.991 --> 17:25.037
I had a rule that no book comes into the house that isn't catalogued immediately.

17:25.077 --> 17:25.558
Good rule.

17:26.138 --> 17:27.280
Very good rule.

17:28.442 --> 17:31.386
And then I later hired someone to put it on a database.

17:31.486 --> 17:33.729
But it's a very quirky catalog.

17:33.769 --> 17:34.530
In fact, I'll show you.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.451
Let's go in here.

17:38.916 --> 17:42.501
The reason that it's quirky is...

17:44.557 --> 18:12.657
oh good oh good that's right this it was the um this is the book i'm not going to go through this is misleadingly detailed in the beginning but the each pair each page is a book and in every case i wrote why i thought it was significant

18:12.839 --> 18:23.030
which is an incredibly good exercise for a collector, because it makes you be explicit about what you're doing or what you see.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.935
I mean, some of these things, these are now all in chronological order.

18:26.955 --> 18:29.077
Of course, I didn't find them that way.

18:29.397 --> 18:40.129
And so I would ask a lot of questions in the catalogs, too, as well as descriptions.

18:41.847 --> 18:43.070
What was I going to say?

18:43.410 --> 18:58.742
The collection consists of about 400 volumes of books.

19:00.157 --> 19:03.181
I don't know how much ephemera, et cetera.

19:03.742 --> 19:07.708
I'm in the process right now of cataloging.

19:07.868 --> 19:09.250
I know the categories.

19:10.111 --> 19:19.905
The categories are paint boxes, drawing workbooks, all behind you.

19:21.647 --> 19:26.434
There are about 20 loose-leaf binders of...

19:26.785 --> 19:55.054
very interesting categories i'll read you some oh i love this this is this is one of the minor ones but it interests the hell out of me and this was art instruction when the united states was at war yeah i mean what this is is a massive exposure to the issues of american cultural values um as it changed

19:55.220 --> 19:57.964
depending on what the crises were in the country.

19:58.344 --> 20:09.720
There's, I have never shown this before, but there's soldier handcraft published by the War Department in 1945.

20:09.800 --> 20:20.215
There's rhetoric about what teaching art to children, you know, there are various, this is a very interesting category that

20:22.321 --> 20:23.163
What is this?

20:23.363 --> 20:24.325
I don't even remember.

20:24.966 --> 20:31.397
These are school catalogs.

20:31.498 --> 20:46.084
Everything from the National Academy, Museum of Fine Arts, Pennsylvania Museum, and then to places like the North Bennett Street School, which has a very important history.

20:46.773 --> 20:52.942
School catalogs, pamphlets, in some cases, curriculum.

20:52.962 --> 20:55.886
This is Andover's curriculum.

20:56.487 --> 21:04.018
As I was putting all this together, I suddenly realized that there was someone I knew who had gone to Andover who became an architect.

21:04.038 --> 21:09.826
And I called and I said, did you have this curriculum when you were young?

21:09.846 --> 21:10.908
This is Andy Dean.

21:11.769 --> 21:14.553
And he said he always wished they had.

21:14.733 --> 21:15.835
But in this

21:16.625 --> 21:26.176
vintage that I have up there catalog, his father's architectural firm actually was the subject of study.

21:26.857 --> 21:36.528
I mean, the layers, the things that come, you know, you sort of wonder, you know, about the coincidences and how planful.

21:36.889 --> 21:44.978
You know, in Andover they taught you about Hagia Sophia, the Parthenon, Williamsburg,

21:45.768 --> 21:52.976
And that to me tells a whole lot.

21:53.157 --> 21:56.360
Anyway, I'll read you a few topics.

21:56.761 --> 22:06.532
These are 19th century painting books, which is a precursor to the coloring book, and all based on the development of chromolithography.

22:06.992 --> 22:15.302
These are art materials catalogs, where you've got pencils, where you've got paints, where you've got brushes, and they're

22:15.502 --> 22:18.306
beautifully, in many cases, beautifully illustrated.

22:19.809 --> 22:22.953
This is summer art schools in the 20th century.

22:22.973 --> 22:35.693
I was thinking that you guys could, I wish there was more time because there are all sorts of things that you might be able to connect to for the work you're doing.

22:35.713 --> 22:40.540
I wish we'd done this sooner from that point of view.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.905
This is just

22:44.054 --> 22:48.299
I love the personal in one's research.

22:49.300 --> 22:53.604
And this is 20th century drawing material.

22:54.285 --> 22:58.970
And these were my two favorite things when I was a child.

22:59.150 --> 23:02.214
This was copying from newspapers.

23:03.735 --> 23:12.745
You wrote the stick and you could get the ink to come off the newspaper and you could sort of like collage with cartoons.

23:13.096 --> 23:13.998
John Nagy.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.180
Do you remember John Nagy?

23:15.822 --> 23:24.721
I used to get up Sunday morning when my parents were still sleeping and turn on the TV and draw along with John Nagy.

23:24.942 --> 23:27.347
And there's his book.

23:27.367 --> 23:33.079
So this is really the 20th century end of the story.

23:37.312 --> 23:43.460
I don't want to go through all of them, but I can read you the categories maybe later.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.323
That might be helpful.

23:45.843 --> 23:57.479
The books that are going to Huntington are those up there and then the ones, the two rows below.

23:58.140 --> 24:07.032
And these are, and everything in the built-in itself, pretty much everything in the built-in, up to here.

24:07.518 --> 24:23.677
And these are all in that annotated library, I would think, which will be given to different libraries, hopefully, so that people can access what's there.

24:23.717 --> 24:30.285
And it's a teaching tool in itself to say how this all fits together.

24:32.965 --> 24:46.906
What I'd like to say about these books that I found so interesting is how dependent all this material was on what would then be technology.

24:46.966 --> 24:55.719
The growth of lithography and the mass production of images made it possible for art instruction to become an industry.

24:56.481 --> 24:58.804
And it became a huge industry.

24:59.105 --> 25:03.170
By the way, you know that little book you gave me from your father?

25:03.190 --> 25:03.590
Yes.

25:03.610 --> 25:07.675
It's in the collection, and it's going Johnson with his name on it.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.380
Come over here, and I'll show you.

25:13.101 --> 25:25.174
The other thing is, I may sound a little bit as if I'm a sort of folky, quirky person who just put all this together, but I had some very great help.

25:26.315 --> 25:27.677
One of the helps

25:28.180 --> 25:31.665
with this book, written by Peter Marzio.

25:31.946 --> 25:35.811
This was actually his dissertation and then published at the Bicentennial.

25:36.352 --> 25:47.569
And this is a review of publications between 1820 and 1860 on art education in the United States.

25:47.589 --> 25:55.200
And I had a rather stunning insight in looking at this recently,

25:55.670 --> 26:04.821
He has an annotated bibliography in the back saying what's in the Library of Congress and what's in the American Antiquarium, blah, blah, blah, and all these different collections.

26:05.783 --> 26:09.808
And I put next to it how many of them are here.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.231
Did I send you that?

26:12.251 --> 26:13.252
No.

26:13.272 --> 26:13.532
No.

26:14.133 --> 26:17.998
And it just, it stunned me.

26:20.020 --> 26:35.885
Part is that I was really prepared for this in my life, but the other thing is that New England has been so incredible in what you could go out on a Sunday morning and find something that's in, you know, the Library of Congress.

26:36.767 --> 26:47.023
And this, I mean, this is just to show you, you have to really sit down with it, but these are the ones that I found and

26:47.307 --> 26:48.949
It's a wonderful catalog.

26:48.989 --> 26:59.523
And many times he says, these are things I heard of, that I knew existed by someone's referring to them, but I've never seen them, and some of those things are right here.

27:01.386 --> 27:11.359
So, what I wanted to show you is some beautiful lithographies, because I see this whole field as growing from that.

27:11.579 --> 27:12.801
Oh, I should tell you something else.

27:13.301 --> 27:14.563
Almost everything...

27:14.965 --> 27:17.749
is from New England flea market.

27:18.570 --> 27:24.057
Almost everything is American printed.

27:24.878 --> 27:31.566
It goes far, probably I have nothing for the South and Philadelphia.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.531
And Boston, it's really big.

27:35.551 --> 27:40.197
And then there's some Ohio stuff, as the West of Illinois.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.584
Cincinnati became a very big art education center.

27:44.624 --> 28:06.526
But anyway, so what I did was set up, in addition to this cataloging rule, I set up the rule of keeping it local and not traveling around, looking, by things published in the other parts of the country, but I don't think I would have found anything anyway.

28:06.606 --> 28:08.968
So that's just to place it.

28:09.472 --> 28:12.296
I sent it in New England.

28:15.942 --> 28:21.850
I did buy some European things because I found them here.

28:21.890 --> 28:31.545
And it seemed a very limiting cutoff point to not get those things.

28:31.565 --> 28:32.947
And I'll show you some of those too.

28:33.007 --> 28:36.412
But let me, this is one of the great treasures to my mind.

28:36.512 --> 28:38.635
It's called the United States Drawing Book.

28:39.256 --> 28:59.678
it's um i mean at this point i looked at the price here it was twenty dollars this is some of the most and that's high for what i paid for things but what's the year on it i'll tell you a second i think it's 1830 something 1838

29:00.232 --> 29:01.073
J.T.

29:01.093 --> 29:07.321
Bowen is the artist, and if you could come, I mean, this is just such knockout gorgeousness.

29:07.341 --> 29:13.468
I mean, in the end, I just can't get over the quality of this.

29:13.488 --> 29:23.720
And this is lithography, and these are sort of, yeah, this is all original lithographic plates.

29:24.641 --> 29:29.327
And the quality, I mean, there's not even any foxing in this.

29:29.797 --> 29:32.199
Or on these plates I'm looking at right now.

29:32.660 --> 29:41.288
But the variation in value, the control of the mark, would have inspired anyone to be an artist.

29:41.468 --> 29:43.290
And that's how I see it.

29:43.310 --> 29:48.835
They have never, most people have never seen other than engraved images.

29:49.176 --> 29:54.601
And suddenly here is the mark that looks like the mark the human hand makes.

29:56.202 --> 29:57.964
And this is...

29:58.315 --> 30:01.459
And this was a major industry.

30:01.779 --> 30:03.822
Let me... I didn't answer.

30:03.962 --> 30:04.402
Yeah.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.588
General instructions in drawing the human figure, outline and shading.

30:09.729 --> 30:12.632
You find all kinds of wonderful things in here.

30:12.652 --> 30:17.438
I'm looking for... Look at the quality of that.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.619
Where did you find that, Diana?

30:18.639 --> 30:20.601
Is that a curiosity?

30:20.621 --> 30:21.482
Yes, I did.

30:21.502 --> 30:23.024
That's the other thing that's weird.

30:23.044 --> 30:24.967
I remember almost everywhere.

30:24.987 --> 30:27.850
I think I got this at Goodspeed.

30:28.184 --> 30:48.427
Goods Thieves used to have treasures that were... Some days, here's the cover, the title says, 1839, the United States Drawing Book, Elements of the Art of Drawing with Lead Pencils, etc.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.930
Anyway, this is one of my favorites.

30:50.950 --> 30:57.718
And there are, many of these are lithographic studies.

30:58.238 --> 31:00.000
These are really sweet.

31:00.020 --> 31:04.286
This is by Benjamin Cole, who was the teacher of Frederick Church.

31:05.728 --> 31:09.914
And... Oh, look at that.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.577
These I bought up in Ipswich.

31:12.378 --> 31:16.523
This is probably the single most copied image by students.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.246
It was this bridge image.

31:18.266 --> 31:24.034
Actually, it's sort of puzzling and interesting of what that meant.

31:24.054 --> 31:27.739
But anyway, this paper is so wonderfully...

31:28.850 --> 31:31.675
I think of it like baby skin.

31:31.755 --> 31:33.337
It's so soft.

31:34.279 --> 31:35.321
Oh, it is like cloth.

31:35.341 --> 31:40.850
Doesn't it be beautiful to draw on that?

31:40.870 --> 31:40.970
Yeah.

31:40.990 --> 31:43.214
So these are Benjamin Coe things.

31:43.795 --> 31:50.105
I'm trying to watch the time because I can go and go and go, and I don't want to wipe you all out.

31:50.526 --> 31:51.347
I want to tell you.

31:51.547 --> 31:53.950
Morton, if you think, I'm not going to worry about you.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.111
There's enough chairs in here.

31:55.171 --> 31:57.493
Everybody, when you get tired, sit down.

31:57.553 --> 32:00.597
If not tired, fine.

32:02.198 --> 32:13.771
So that side goes pretty much through the development of art education in Boston with Walter Smith and the stuff I wrote about in Drawn to Art.

32:16.294 --> 32:16.774
Let me see.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.516
I'm hopping to both sides.

32:19.542 --> 32:24.168
Um, yeah, I wanted to show you this, Nick, just to make a connection.

32:24.229 --> 32:33.121
The crayon books that we were, the crayons that we were looking at before, this is the Munsell color notation, if you want to look at it later.

32:33.141 --> 32:46.039
Um, it's a little bit misleading because so many of the books are very large that they're not all in order over here, but anyway.

32:46.947 --> 32:54.096
I want to point out this because I consider this my great treasures.

32:55.138 --> 33:01.546
This is sort of like the Rosetta Stone that makes the whole rest of the collection hang together.

33:02.447 --> 33:05.190
And it's amazingly not known.

33:05.311 --> 33:14.963
You can still buy these pretty... I see them and in fact I had Mass Art buy one when I found a set not so long ago.

33:15.179 --> 33:43.262
what these are are four volumes of the history of all art programming in the united states from yeah exactly uh published by the united states senate in the late 1880s and 1890s the story to be told from this collection is so different than what we know um the united states

33:43.833 --> 34:08.731
government was convinced that art education was going to improve the balance of trade, it was going to make our products competitive with European products, and it was meticulous in these reports, in finding out what was happening in Toledo, Ohio, what was happening in Baltimore, and not only at the time of the publication, but retrospectively.

34:09.552 --> 34:12.557
These are on terrible paper,

34:13.212 --> 34:16.216
I'm really worried about these for the future.

34:16.236 --> 34:21.102
They're practically like newspaper, and they just crumble when you look at them.

34:21.122 --> 34:39.405
But it's very biased, it has the orientation to industry, but it's so rich, and you can read between the lines and find other things that were happening besides what they advocated.

34:39.976 --> 35:01.275
what are they called they're called the senate documents um art and industry is i think the working title art and industry a four-part volume it's indexed in it's in the bibliography of grown to art um but anyway there is not a single image

35:01.829 --> 35:07.716
in those four bodies, which is another reason that nobody would have paid any attention to them.

35:07.756 --> 35:08.717
How did you discover it?

35:08.797 --> 35:19.490
Well, I was teaching at MassArt and trying to learn more about Massachusetts' unique history within the whole art education field.

35:20.551 --> 35:22.073
I don't know how I first found it.

35:22.553 --> 35:27.819
I know MassArt didn't have one set, so I don't remember that.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.182
I don't know.

35:30.787 --> 35:35.414
But when you start for the first time, you must have realized it was something extraordinary.

35:35.434 --> 35:35.634
Oh, yeah.

35:35.654 --> 35:36.095
Yeah.

35:36.115 --> 35:43.946
And the town-by-town thing is what's... You know, we are so much a people of generalizations now.

35:44.066 --> 35:56.885
The schools are, the this is that, and these are all specific, detailed accounts of who the teachers were, how many students came, whether they were night courses or day courses.

35:57.806 --> 36:00.270
And you learn so much from that.

36:00.470 --> 36:20.712
In the Massachusetts drawing law that was passed in 1870 that required the towns offer free night and day classes for people who lived in towns with populations of over 10,000.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.115
Now, I puzzled about that.

36:23.155 --> 36:25.117
I thought, what is this 10,000 thing?

36:25.397 --> 36:28.941
And I suddenly realized that was the way of having control

36:29.427 --> 36:33.992
over what happened in the mills, because those big towns were the mill towns.

36:35.034 --> 36:42.743
So they could control the curriculum to feed into the aesthetic of the manufacturing that was happening in those towns.

36:43.384 --> 36:46.748
So the details, as any researcher knows, is the whole story.

36:46.768 --> 36:48.910
Why do you think drawing was so important, then?

36:49.651 --> 36:51.874
I mean, really, because we don't see it today.

36:51.914 --> 36:56.920
Well, that's, of course, the thing.

36:57.170 --> 37:04.217
The industrial economic advantage is the reason it was so appealing.

37:05.018 --> 37:13.687
Secondarily, we were becoming more and more of an urban country, and art was sort of seen as high art.

37:14.108 --> 37:24.679
And there was a lot of waffling between high art and industrial to appeal to different people's ambitions.

37:25.368 --> 37:31.535
I have a wonderful little drawing book I'll show you for children called High Art for the Nursery.

37:33.016 --> 37:34.478
High Art for the Nursery.

37:34.578 --> 37:39.543
And what it is is on the cover are these birds high up in a tree.

37:40.044 --> 37:45.270
I mean, you get a whole kind of melding of ideas.

37:45.310 --> 37:49.975
I want to show you something else that's very interesting about this collection.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.978
This is the exception to the rule.

37:53.347 --> 37:56.091
Not so much, but these are the European things.

37:56.992 --> 37:57.052
Oh.

37:57.072 --> 37:59.236
Now, were these used for American schools?

37:59.256 --> 37:59.716
Yeah.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.539
Or American individuals.

38:01.559 --> 38:02.520
This I'm going to show you.

38:02.561 --> 38:06.526
This is a great treasure, probably the most expensive thing I bought.

38:08.149 --> 38:18.163
And it really tested my theory of what am I doing this for and why should this be in this collection.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.328
This is about 20 years old now, maybe 15 years.

38:22.422 --> 38:33.694
But in my travels, I went to the area around Frederick Church's house, Hudson, New York, and all that stuff.

38:33.714 --> 38:39.621
And there was a really nice bookshop there that I can't remember the name of right now.

38:39.681 --> 38:45.407
But I found this treasure in it, and I had never seen a drawing book like this.

38:46.008 --> 38:49.712
I do look at European drawing books, even though they don't mostly collect them.

38:50.215 --> 38:59.125
And this just blew my mind, and I thought, somebody in this geographical area used this book.

38:59.145 --> 39:01.287
And this was kind of an artist's picture.

39:01.988 --> 39:04.310
Thomas Cole was on one side of the river.

39:05.231 --> 39:10.557
So I will show you some of the most exquisite plates.

39:10.577 --> 39:16.383
This is late 18th century perspective studies of hands.

39:16.623 --> 39:18.265
I mean.

39:20.489 --> 39:23.533
And it's such beautiful condition.

39:23.553 --> 39:29.401
So, I leave this to somebody else to figure out what's the story.

39:29.862 --> 39:36.090
It's a French book, and it was in a really sort of quite ordinary bookstore.

39:38.974 --> 39:40.997
Beautiful quality.

39:41.938 --> 39:44.862
And these perspective things.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.387
Okay, so...

39:48.991 --> 39:52.315
We could go on with that, but... Yeah, it really is.

39:52.355 --> 39:52.636
It really is.

39:54.057 --> 39:56.761
Will you tell us how much you paid for it?

39:56.781 --> 40:01.146
Yeah, I think that book was way off the charts for me.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.068
I think it's $250.

40:02.148 --> 40:08.896
They didn't know that was important.

40:09.377 --> 40:10.438
No, no.

40:10.839 --> 40:13.342
Many, many, many of these things.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.686
I'm looking to see if there actually is a price in here.

40:18.505 --> 40:24.711
This was a generation of artist family, Jean Cousin.

40:24.731 --> 40:26.433
Could you tell us the title, please?

40:26.633 --> 40:35.301
L'art du dessin démontré d'une manière claire et précise.

40:36.222 --> 40:36.563
G-U-S-S-I-M.

40:37.884 --> 40:39.005
That's drawing.

40:39.686 --> 40:43.870
Is there an author?

40:43.890 --> 40:45.251
Jean Cousin.

40:45.291 --> 40:47.213
C-O-U-S-I-M.

40:48.712 --> 41:17.858
it was written in here at 1778 to 1821 and then i did a national union catalog search and found ancestors of this maker who did other books this is probably the hardest thing to find what's your best guess you said somebody used that i don't have i can't i do not see a connection

41:18.412 --> 41:29.749
from the art that was made in that area and this, but its proximity just said, keep them together, keep it in the collection.

41:29.769 --> 41:32.292
So, let's go sit at the table.

41:32.353 --> 41:35.277
Did you price code things as you bought them too?

41:35.477 --> 41:36.659
Sometimes.

41:36.819 --> 41:41.967
Not as religiously as you cataloged them.

41:41.987 --> 41:43.930
I may have, I can't really remember.

41:44.370 --> 41:47.575
What I know I wanted to do and didn't do

41:47.926 --> 41:52.292
was to price them as the catalogs came in, you know.

41:53.774 --> 41:57.740
That just... I didn't know whether to believe them or not.

41:57.800 --> 41:58.841
You can't do everything.

41:58.941 --> 41:59.702
Exactly.

42:00.523 --> 42:03.367
I think I did write down what I did.

42:03.387 --> 42:06.692
What did you say the category over here was?

42:06.732 --> 42:08.635
You said, these are the more modern.

42:08.895 --> 42:11.098
And it goes up to here.

42:11.315 --> 42:20.810
So there are things like Victor D'Amico, who is Museum of Modern Art, 30s art education.

42:21.671 --> 42:23.374
John Dewey is in here.

42:23.394 --> 42:30.886
There's a whole... How do you feel right now, three days before you part with this, showing this for what might be... Restless.

42:30.906 --> 42:31.667
Restless.

42:31.687 --> 42:31.888
Yeah.

42:32.609 --> 42:36.495
I really... It's very, very strange.

42:37.370 --> 42:41.215
And I feel like everybody around me is very understanding.

42:42.356 --> 42:49.585
But it's like taking a big trip, you know, when you take a big trip and you think, can I get everything done?

42:50.507 --> 42:53.090
And how does the new life and the old life fit?

42:53.691 --> 42:55.233
I don't know.

42:56.514 --> 42:59.318
And Diana, this was gathered over, what, you said a 30-year period?

42:59.338 --> 43:03.423
25-ish, 25, I feel is probably more accurate.

43:03.483 --> 43:06.567
I was saying 30, but I think...

43:07.424 --> 43:08.865
Well, how are you doing?

43:08.885 --> 43:11.488
You getting worn out?

43:11.548 --> 43:15.632
Okay, let's go into the dining room.

43:15.652 --> 43:26.742
You can hear her describe it, because I've heard I've collected all these years, you know, and I'm not an art person, but, oh, I found this great thing for $2.

43:26.802 --> 43:28.904
I'm going to bring in one thing.

43:29.545 --> 43:35.170
Oh, well, I do have a lot of these things.

43:36.179 --> 43:38.523
The ephemeral thing.

43:41.808 --> 44:02.220
When I was in the process of looking for new homes for this collection, I made a pen-page summary of what's here, and I will just read you the names

44:02.993 --> 44:06.556
of the categories, so you get an idea.

44:06.576 --> 44:09.319
And then I'm going to show you something.

44:12.842 --> 44:14.363
This all makes me very sad.

44:14.463 --> 44:16.165
It's sort of overwhelming.

44:17.866 --> 44:27.795
This is probably a missed, it's probably more, but the categories, I'm just going to tell you.

44:27.815 --> 44:32.359
There are color instruction kits, about ten of them.

44:32.660 --> 44:36.646
pamphlets from art lectures, art teacher lectures.

44:39.330 --> 44:44.638
I'm going to stop a minute because I just want to tell you something I meant to say before that I lost.

44:45.099 --> 44:45.960
I forgot to tell you.

44:46.421 --> 44:50.888
That I've decided is my big aha of the day.

44:51.549 --> 45:00.743
And I was thinking, why is it that these things were so available and were so cheap?

45:01.752 --> 45:04.495
It's not just isn't it fun to find a bargain.

45:04.815 --> 45:09.521
It's a part of the social history of the objects that they were not valued.

45:10.862 --> 45:24.317
And I think the history of American taste in art and certainly in art education has been to have a disdain for one's predecessor.

45:24.905 --> 45:29.150
It's sort of an automatic disrespect.

45:29.170 --> 45:33.154
So, you know, it was just incredible what one could find.

45:33.214 --> 45:49.512
And it had no, I mean, you think of it, I'm not the greatest fan of the NEA, but you think about how we're dismantling one major cultural conduit.

45:49.532 --> 45:53.256
And I see this as part of just, it doesn't matter.

45:53.336 --> 45:54.557
You know, it's all sort of,

45:54.824 --> 45:59.330
Those funny things people... History doesn't matter and art doesn't matter.

45:59.350 --> 46:00.451
It's a double whammy.

46:01.112 --> 46:07.901
That, you know, it's old stuff and we're on to new stuff and it's art and who cares about art anyway?

46:07.921 --> 46:13.989
Well, thank God there are art museums and there are people that still care about collections.

46:14.770 --> 46:21.338
And that's how I believe I was able to find so much, so...

46:22.432 --> 46:38.365
relatively easily this stuff by the way is not around anymore every once in a while we well andy my partner in life uh um we he likes still to go to flea market and stuff and um

46:38.783 --> 46:39.504
We don't see.

46:39.524 --> 46:42.507
I mean, I'm not collecting anymore.

46:42.567 --> 46:50.415
But I don't know what's going to happen, Nick, when this is all over emotionally.

46:50.535 --> 46:55.020
I know a man who had a photo history museum.

46:55.620 --> 46:59.985
Jack Naylor is his name, maybe some of you know him.

47:00.005 --> 47:07.913
He had an extraordinary museum, and he sold it to Japan, and they made a museum in Japan of the history of American photography.

47:08.230 --> 47:13.535
No sooner was it gone, then he started it all over again.

47:13.576 --> 47:15.878
So, but I don't think the stuff is there anymore.

47:15.938 --> 47:17.700
But anyway, let me give you the categories.

47:18.100 --> 47:27.750
Color instruction, lecture, art lectures, drawing, models.

47:29.252 --> 47:31.494
Those are like single lithographic plates.

47:32.075 --> 47:34.457
Behind you, Ruth, are tons of

47:34.808 --> 47:38.555
boxes from the 18th century.

47:38.575 --> 47:42.982
I'm telling you, these were in the junk in the flea market.

47:45.086 --> 47:53.921
So there are a lot of paint boxes over there, some very fine and some very, they were sort of like rewards of merit for little children in the 1890s.

47:54.242 --> 47:56.125
The whole spread is there.

47:56.257 --> 47:59.261
Art supply catalogs, glass slates.

47:59.281 --> 48:01.644
Slates were a way children learned to draw.

48:01.684 --> 48:07.270
They'd have wood engravings on one side of glass, and a set of wood engravings would come.

48:07.390 --> 48:12.977
I'll show you that if I... I just want to give you the lay of the land, because I can't show you all this stuff.

48:13.818 --> 48:23.530
Drawing cards, with the growth of lithography, was the production

48:24.151 --> 48:50.327
of these things most people have not heard of it really is fun it's like um they are here's an example of one these this is the 18th 18 58 um these are cards and the child would get them either to work on at home or at school and um

48:51.623 --> 48:58.950
They are the majority of the index in Peter Marzio's Bibliology.

49:01.973 --> 49:03.734
Did I do the whole thing already?

49:06.837 --> 49:12.943
Stencil boxes, trade and art school catalog, summer art school catalog.

49:12.983 --> 49:14.485
You responded to that before.

49:14.545 --> 49:21.411
Rockport, Obunque, Ipswich, Arthur Wesley Dow School.

49:22.117 --> 49:50.807
um those things advertising trade cards you know that would have told you um you know buy your shoes at such and such a place or coats thread or soaping soap powder and the images often were images of artists at easels and that was again this class mobility and you be a fancier person buy soaping and

49:51.260 --> 49:52.642
you'll be like an artist.

49:53.362 --> 50:07.219
And the very important image content about artists, not ever explicitly said, but you can't miss it when you have a lot of them.

50:07.900 --> 50:13.166
A number of those cards are introduced in Drunk Art.

50:14.247 --> 50:20.254
So then there are wooden forms, you know, like cones and blocks.

50:20.892 --> 50:23.675
and things that artists drew from.

50:25.017 --> 50:44.882
And this, you know, this weird feeling I have as I go through this, I don't know where some of this stuff is, but there were, in the 1870s, with the drawing law, there was a boom in the making of educational art equipment.

50:45.322 --> 50:48.306
And there were these beautiful little slaves.

50:48.326 --> 50:49.768
I don't know where they are right now.

50:50.677 --> 51:03.390
That behind you, Catherine and Bill, is the Chautauqua Arts Desk, which has a whole curriculum you roll, 1895.

51:03.530 --> 51:11.899
It's just wonderful, and it's all the charm of modernity and inventions.

51:11.919 --> 51:13.581
And where did you find that?

51:15.723 --> 51:20.548
I picture, you know Jolly Jim's

51:20.832 --> 51:29.660
It's really true that Jolly Tibbs and Wilbur used to go there, Nancy, right?

51:29.680 --> 51:36.286
Now it's t-shirts and socks that they sell there, but they used to have... Was it like an antique?

51:36.306 --> 51:38.508
They used to have an antique area.

51:38.628 --> 51:39.989
They used to have it on the radio.

51:40.510 --> 51:41.731
Yes, yes.

51:42.151 --> 51:49.438
And then they alternated with a more upscale antique show in that same place, and I'm not sure which...

51:50.245 --> 52:00.416
And then these are all coloring books behind you, Morten.

52:00.556 --> 52:02.478
And then magazines on art.

52:03.039 --> 52:15.392
I have a complete edition of School Arts magazine, and many, many very interesting magazines on craft and taste.

52:16.435 --> 52:43.692
I was explaining to some of you who got here first something I feel very strongly about saying again, and that is that as much as I was a pack rat and had a vision to save all this stuff, there was someone who preceded me who was art director for the public schools of Gloucester who

52:44.110 --> 52:47.575
saved everything that came into her house.

52:47.595 --> 52:59.212
Crayon samples, paint samples, art instruction magazines, manuals, this school arts magazine, which is a fantastic 20th century resource.

53:00.293 --> 53:01.515
She saved every issue.

53:02.597 --> 53:11.890
And a student of mine led me to this collection, and I just bought out her apartment.

53:12.308 --> 53:19.359
And as I'm getting ready, I mean her, this student's husband was a bookseller.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.764
She attended MassArt in the class of 1902.

53:24.427 --> 53:31.538
And her whole portfolio and materials and everything is, they are not going, I'm probably going to give that to MassArt.

53:34.643 --> 53:35.785
But what was I going to say?

53:36.085 --> 53:39.790
She had this sense of the object as document.

53:39.810 --> 53:46.099
She just, I don't know, maybe I'm reading into her, but why was her house full of that stuff?

53:46.159 --> 53:50.325
But it's all... Was it only that stuff?

53:50.345 --> 53:50.826
And what?

53:50.866 --> 53:52.228
Was it only that stuff?

53:53.229 --> 53:56.234
No, she also collected a world wool on posters.

53:56.494 --> 54:03.063
She had lots of aesthetics, but she clearly loved visual material.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.046
And...

54:06.359 --> 54:08.801
So she's my partner, isn't it?

54:08.821 --> 54:10.142
She's long deceased.

54:10.302 --> 54:11.123
I mean, not so long.

54:11.183 --> 54:12.584
I bought it from her estate.

54:14.826 --> 54:16.068
Did you know her?

54:16.148 --> 54:17.569
No, I didn't know her.

54:17.589 --> 54:24.775
I knew a young man who had studied with her and knew her and said how remarkable she was.

54:26.116 --> 54:30.861
And I was going to interview him more, and my instinct was not to.

54:31.061 --> 54:32.422
Can you tell us her name?

54:32.882 --> 54:34.864
Mabel Spofford.

54:35.688 --> 54:38.811
And she was a wonderful artist on her own night.

54:39.572 --> 55:02.995
I mean, the whole thing... I don't want to get into this pontificating, but the level of general artistry was so much... You know, if you were trained, the level of teacher artistry, let's put it that way, or practicing amateurs, is mind-boggling to us today, who mostly have not had that training.

55:03.278 --> 55:07.344
or who had the training I grew up in.

55:07.405 --> 55:11.571
My niece was here when I was doing this little chat last week.

55:11.591 --> 55:15.257
And it was so funny to be able to tell her this, which of course she wouldn't know.

55:15.798 --> 55:22.809
But I grew up in a period when you were not supposed to look at any examples of art.

55:22.829 --> 55:25.453
You were supposed to bring it from inside.

55:25.774 --> 55:26.795
How do you do that?

55:27.777 --> 55:29.640
I tried my best.

55:29.857 --> 55:43.150
And my mother, who had been an art student at Cooper Union, was adamant about not copying and about expressivity and all that stuff, which was a very exciting thing to grow up with.

55:43.771 --> 55:52.480
But the joke I was telling to my niece is, you know, Mother said, no, coloring books.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.621
I got tons of them.

55:54.582 --> 55:55.203
Anyway.

55:55.223 --> 55:56.484
Are any of them colored in?

55:56.824 --> 55:57.725
Yes.

55:57.745 --> 55:59.627
And that's a great interest to me.

56:00.299 --> 56:10.193
Many of the children's drawings are like, especially when they're very young children's drawings, they're very like what you'd say today.

56:10.213 --> 56:13.637
You know, but we sort of clean all that up.

56:13.657 --> 56:24.132
In fact, when I bought some people said, I'm going to do it, well, this isn't so good, it's got some crayon in it.

56:24.152 --> 56:28.618
So, there are many interesting stories about buying this stuff.

56:29.341 --> 56:30.843
I'll tell you the other end of it.

56:31.124 --> 56:33.687
I mean, the coloring books I bought for Peanuts.

56:33.708 --> 56:37.613
It started being so interesting, and then it got more and more interesting.

56:38.054 --> 56:52.856
Yesterday, Andy and I were wandering around and hopped into this really pathetic flea market, and there was one drawing book called the Boy Scout Drawing Book, 19-something when the Boy Scouts were formed.

56:52.876 --> 56:56.802
$50 for that drawing book now.

56:56.982 --> 56:58.825
So it's a completely...

56:59.345 --> 57:02.849
Well, does that encourage you now, because you see the high prices?

57:02.869 --> 57:05.373
That must indicate that the interest is coming back.

57:06.494 --> 57:17.428
Well, you get... I don't think it is... In that case, it's the Boy Scout-ness of the material, not the coloring book thing.

57:18.849 --> 57:19.290
Good point.

57:20.311 --> 57:28.862
There are many intersecting audiences for this, other than the...

57:30.361 --> 57:32.384
the one that is my major focus.

57:35.408 --> 57:37.932
How you doing?

57:38.132 --> 57:38.493
Great.

57:38.713 --> 57:41.217
I'm going to show you some, yeah.

57:41.317 --> 57:45.683
But I want to show you this first because this is another lesson about buying.

57:45.703 --> 57:49.809
This is also from Goodspeed.

57:49.929 --> 57:56.779
Somebody was saying before asked about Goodspeed or where something came from.

57:57.540 --> 57:59.423
I really miss that place.

57:59.977 --> 58:07.927
But anyway, I used to go in there like a drunk and say, you got any other education stuff today?

58:07.947 --> 58:14.675
And the guy who I was talking to, who I've seen many times, said, nope.

58:15.877 --> 58:18.961
And he had this on his lap.

58:18.981 --> 58:20.583
And he was cataloging.

58:20.623 --> 58:28.853
Now, the reason that I make the point of this is that it's very hard to know what you have until you spend a lot of time looking at it.

58:29.187 --> 58:36.498
I don't know what he thought this was, but this is from about 1800.

58:36.538 --> 58:43.488
It's called Mariantha of Numberless Groups of Changeable Flowers.

58:44.449 --> 58:48.475
It was printed in London, but it was clearly used here.

58:48.495 --> 58:57.068
The girl who owned this was Mary Whitney, and it was a gift from Colonel Davis of Philadelphia.

58:58.364 --> 59:04.954
And what this is, is a wonderful manual, very typical of English manuals.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.258
But that was when I drew the line.

59:07.719 --> 59:10.363
The British really valued these things.

59:10.603 --> 59:12.787
And when I was in London, I saw these.

59:12.827 --> 59:17.414
I saw how many and exquisite they are.

59:17.454 --> 59:26.228
But this one I found here, so I figured it could have been used by a privileged young lady in this culture.

59:27.305 --> 59:56.046
this is the very frequently done convention of having the color squares in the text all hand colored and then later on there are these plates of flower compositions the purpose of this art instruction manual was to teach you color harmony and color composition

59:56.397 --> 01:00:22.337
and the way you did it that's one of the reasons this is one of my favorite things oh my is that you've got these flowers on little like popsicle sticks and you inserted them in these and this i'll show you first because it's not as magical as what's to come but here is what's coming

01:00:23.566 --> 01:00:27.712
You see why I thought Shelley would be particularly interested in that.

01:00:28.112 --> 01:00:38.146
And here, so there are three of these, and you were, they all have slipped to put these in, and then these are the flowers.

01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:42.131
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:00:42.151 --> 01:00:43.873
Isn't that wonderful?

01:00:43.893 --> 01:00:45.135
This is a little painting.
