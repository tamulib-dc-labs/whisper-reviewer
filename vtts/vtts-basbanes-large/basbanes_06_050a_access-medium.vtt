WEBVTT

00:05.195 --> 00:08.239
And this is what Mark found.

00:08.259 --> 00:18.072
So we're in the... Taylor is a very interesting... Well, my primary interest is in collectors and what they've contributed.

00:19.374 --> 00:28.907
Taylor is one of those stories where you have one of these wonderful collectors who did something, I mean, that's almost... You hesitate to use the word unique, but...

00:29.208 --> 00:30.810
He did place his collection here.

00:30.991 --> 00:31.291
Yeah.

00:32.112 --> 00:34.716
I don't know if he committed it until it finally came.

00:35.737 --> 00:35.878
Right.

00:35.898 --> 00:40.024
Well, it was understood that he would leave his collection to the university.

00:40.044 --> 00:40.504
Or was.

00:40.725 --> 00:41.286
Yeah.

00:41.306 --> 00:44.110
He was the chairman of the Friends of the Library for 25 years.

00:45.251 --> 00:49.718
The dates are over here.

00:49.738 --> 00:52.462
From, I think, 54 to 1980.

00:52.482 --> 00:52.622
Mm-hmm.

00:52.642 --> 00:54.585
And he was very active in the Groyer Club, too.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.409
He was the president of the Groyer Club for a term.

00:58.435 --> 00:58.996
1908, 1985.

00:59.136 --> 01:00.097
Okay, now.

01:00.197 --> 01:02.819
Yeah, he was a member of the class of 1930.

01:03.019 --> 01:06.903
What was the source of his wealth?

01:07.063 --> 01:08.244
That's an interesting story.

01:08.324 --> 01:11.968
His grandfather's name was John Ambrose.

01:13.529 --> 01:14.390
What was the book?

01:15.251 --> 01:23.039
I think he was known as the millionaire strap hanger because he commuted to his office from his house in Yonkers.

01:23.059 --> 01:27.683
And at the time he died, I think he was one of the 12

01:28.000 --> 01:56.657
12 richest men in the united states and he started his fortune by um by being the first person to put iron into pill form and into what kind of fall into the form of a pill really and he well he was a druggist and he sold it under the name saratan which yeah of course you know saratan like uh dwight church and uh arwin hammer or whatever yeah right he had a penchant for uh putting for spelling things backwards

01:56.975 --> 01:58.657
where the sartan is naked spelled backwards.

01:58.677 --> 02:10.775
And he also set up a foundation called the Surdina Foundation, which was partly, I think, to benefit orphans, but I think it's still in existence and it benefits all sorts of causes.

02:10.795 --> 02:16.263
But John Andrews's wife was an orphan, and so that was one reason he set up that foundation.

02:16.764 --> 02:24.274
Bob Taylor was his grandson, and because of the family fortune, he never had to work for anyone.

02:24.295 --> 02:26.037
And when he graduated in 1930,

02:26.371 --> 02:38.522
He went to work in an architect's office, but he never had anything to do except crossword puzzles, so he quit that and just devoted himself full-time to book collecting.

02:39.824 --> 02:48.312
I guess it provides something of a precedent for the Shady, although there is a significant difference in that.

02:48.332 --> 02:55.078
I'm not really asking you to comment on that, but it doesn't help me understand.

02:55.092 --> 03:01.240
Yeah, there are some obvious similarities, obvious differences too.

03:01.600 --> 03:10.892
Bob Taylor's only interest as far as collecting for this collection is concerned was English literature and for a while American literature, though he's taught that after a while.

03:11.273 --> 03:21.606
But he collected for 60 years and when he collected things that were outside the scope of the collection, he gave them to the library for general rare book collections.

03:22.312 --> 03:37.573
I think they had a similar legal arrangement, that is that the books belonged to the collector during his life, and then depending on whether the institution was still in favor with the collector or at the time of his death, they would get the books.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.536
So there was an escape plot?

03:39.956 --> 03:41.298
I think so.

03:41.378 --> 03:45.284
I think, you know, you've got any kind of leverage at all, it only makes sense.

03:45.804 --> 03:47.847
And certainly that's what Bill Seide is doing, too.

03:48.299 --> 03:54.386
I mean, I'll put the machine up.

03:54.406 --> 03:57.029
These are Bill Scheide's books, and he doesn't want people to forget that.

03:57.370 --> 04:02.836
I think it would be insulting to him, of course, if we were to say, well, this is one of our collections, which, of course, is not easy.

04:02.856 --> 04:08.643
He's actively forming that collection, just the way Pop Taylor very actively formed this collection up to the time of his death.

04:09.163 --> 04:13.729
Was this the room actually that, was this his room while he was alive?

04:14.149 --> 04:18.154
Yes, it was from about 1972, 1971 or 72.

04:18.472 --> 04:28.002
Within about ten years of moving to Princeton, he outgrew his library at home, and so he talked to Bill Dix, who was a librarian then.

04:28.082 --> 04:33.228
I think it was Bill Dix, and said, it's all in there.

04:33.308 --> 04:35.030
We don't verify that.

04:35.751 --> 04:42.298
Bill Dix suggested to him that he deposit the book here in what up to that time had been the Princetonian Room.

04:42.618 --> 04:46.082
The present Princetonian Room is at the end of the

04:46.788 --> 04:51.835
the public catalog section when you first come in the building.

04:53.196 --> 04:59.505
But it seemed like a natural thing to do since this is right at the end of the gallery of their books.

04:59.525 --> 05:05.673
What distinguishes this as a collection or what makes this a remarkable collection?

05:05.693 --> 05:07.795
Is there anything that makes it a remarkable collection?

05:07.815 --> 05:15.225
The most remarkable thing about it is that you have the temerity to collect not just Victorian authors or one author or a lot of

05:15.543 --> 05:25.875
of course, just specializing one author over one century or maybe two centuries, but he collected all of English literature, which really was very ambitious.

05:26.757 --> 05:31.502
Did he collect authors who were not fashionable at the time?

05:31.522 --> 05:35.327
Yes, he collected Trollope before Trollope was fashionable.

05:35.367 --> 05:35.667
Really?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.970
And he has one of the best Trollope collections in the world.

05:39.572 --> 05:43.677
Walter Bennett had also a collection

05:44.433 --> 05:46.896
pretty much on a par with Bob Terrace of Trout.

05:46.936 --> 05:48.559
And where is Barrett's collection?

05:48.959 --> 05:49.940
It's in Virginia now.

05:50.121 --> 05:50.541
Okay.

05:51.463 --> 05:52.724
Mr. Shady mentioned his name.

05:52.844 --> 05:53.225
Yeah.

05:53.245 --> 05:54.527
He's a very important collector.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.711
And I hear it over and over after that, but I'm looking at him.

05:57.811 --> 06:01.616
Yeah, you've really got to look at him, because he was a very popular collector among collectors.

06:01.636 --> 06:05.822
Of course, they know each other very well, and they have strong opinions about each other.

06:06.223 --> 06:11.049
I think Walter Barrett and Carol Wilson was another collector of Trout.

06:11.129 --> 06:13.933
Carol Wilson was a very well-respected

06:14.302 --> 06:16.724
collector, mainly I think of Victorians.

06:17.245 --> 06:17.845
Well, let's see.

06:17.945 --> 06:25.492
I think of Victorians.

06:25.792 --> 06:35.881
This is set up right now for a meeting which is going to take place on Monday, which I don't think Bob Taylor has been crazy about that.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.622
It's a reasonable use of the space.

06:39.264 --> 06:43.027
Did you know him at all, by the way?

06:43.047 --> 06:43.127
Yes.

06:43.428 --> 06:53.945
Quite a lot of books for him when he was buying a lot of about 700 Sheridan books from Quartz.

06:53.965 --> 06:59.033
I was calling him the duplicates for him.

06:59.093 --> 07:03.079
I think Carol Wilson was mainly interested in 19th century fiction.

07:03.820 --> 07:09.469
But he was a very important collector.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.054
Go ahead.

07:14.074 --> 07:18.000
And Bob Taylor met him, and he knew Carol Wilson.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.623
I think he knew most of the collectors about his time.

07:21.665 --> 07:26.852
And his time extends from the late 20s to the mid-80s.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.818
I should be like, this is our retirement book.

07:32.180 --> 07:32.680
I would think.

07:33.321 --> 07:34.563
Is that where Wilson's books went?

07:34.843 --> 07:37.007
No, but I mean, they should have this book.

07:37.027 --> 07:37.567
Oh, sure.

07:37.647 --> 07:38.128
Oh, I'm sure.

07:38.168 --> 07:40.131
I mean, there's a graphical collection.

07:41.866 --> 07:43.008
Tell me a little bit about Taylor.

07:45.191 --> 07:48.736
Did he collect things that Princeton wouldn't have otherwise?

07:48.896 --> 07:49.217
Yes.

07:49.777 --> 08:10.928
I think when, in fact, he had put together a pretty good Dickens collection and I think a number of other Victorians, and when he decided to give his books to Princeton, he simply, well, I'm not sure what he did with his Dickens books, whether he

08:11.262 --> 08:21.172
gave them to the general rare book collection or what he did, but they're not in the collection here because they duplicate things in general rare books.

08:21.713 --> 08:40.813
One of the stories that Nicholas Barker told me in England, and then Roger Stoddard repeated it again, but it's kind of a, you talk about deaccessioning duplicates or the Vaughan, the silent scotillians, I guess, that Jackson actually decided to sell it.

08:41.030 --> 08:54.967
perfect copy of that book to Taylor because he felt that in private hands it would be kept better than... It's interesting, you know, sometimes we were discussing the general consideration.

08:55.488 --> 09:01.755
Are certain books better off in private hands than there are in institutions?

09:01.775 --> 09:02.777
They said, well, there's a case.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.740
And they said, the irony of that, of course, is that went back to Princeton.

09:07.983 --> 09:09.585
Who knows, maybe Jackson was looking

09:10.426 --> 09:15.513
At that point, maybe there was no commitment made to Prince Poustahat and Rose.

09:16.254 --> 09:18.878
But now you have the Vaughan in here someplace, I would suppose.

09:19.299 --> 09:21.682
I guess, let me look in the catalog.

09:21.802 --> 09:32.698
Any of those stories about the accessioning, of course the whole business is potentially so controversial that we generally don't tell you about that.

09:32.718 --> 09:36.343
Whatever the story is.

09:37.885 --> 09:38.526
Indeed.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.993
16th century, 17th century.

09:43.013 --> 09:46.520
Oh, 1655.

09:46.720 --> 09:59.664
Well, that's, uh... Does it say 7 Gables here?

09:59.844 --> 10:01.307
FG down to the bottom of the top.

10:13.420 --> 10:17.123
I guess, you know, I really wanted to come in and touch base with you.

10:17.183 --> 10:21.347
I mean, this does provide something of it.

10:21.527 --> 10:25.291
Taylor comes in in context in my book with Shady.

10:25.311 --> 10:32.317
I mean, we certainly don't want to write the kind of book that I'm writing and not mention him.

10:33.698 --> 10:36.120
So you're trying to find the appropriate place to bring him in.

10:36.140 --> 10:39.383
And I think appropriately he comes in here.

10:39.403 --> 10:43.427
I mean, he does form a kind of a precedent, I guess.

10:43.812 --> 10:50.223
What's the reaction on the campus to Scheide's achievement with his 36-line Bible?

10:50.243 --> 10:55.992
Well, everybody who knows about it is very apt for him, because he got it at such a barman.

10:56.873 --> 11:03.304
And, of course, Bill Stonewood said he could die happy now.

11:03.504 --> 11:06.049
He's got, in fact, I think, what was it, the three books?

11:06.569 --> 11:10.596
They just sat with it for half an hour, just spent the half an hour thing out there.

11:10.846 --> 11:12.990
had a chance to go with them?

11:13.010 --> 11:13.731
Bill showed it to me.

11:13.772 --> 11:15.294
Bill Stoneman showed it to me one time.

11:15.314 --> 11:15.856
It's beautiful.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.903
The type, to me, is so much more beautiful than the 42-line Bible type.

11:19.923 --> 11:20.424
Exquisite.

11:20.725 --> 11:23.350
I didn't expect it to be in the condition that it is.

11:23.370 --> 11:28.499
I think I expected something a little more, you know, not what I saw.

11:28.660 --> 11:33.529
But in the circles that you move in, which are the

11:34.133 --> 11:37.557
I feel like circles, and there were books of circles in the library.

11:37.577 --> 11:39.299
Well, what's the reaction to this?

11:40.120 --> 11:56.420
Well, I'm not as... Really, I don't circulate as much in those circles as Steve or Bill Joyce do, but I'm sure Bill could give you a... Gaged feeling, like in the Groyer Club, that those would be the people whose reaction you'd want to get.

11:56.460 --> 12:01.626
I'm sure Bill Shining could... Sorry, Bill Joyce could...

12:02.045 --> 12:06.129
I couldn't give you an earful about that, because it was, of course, very celebrating.

12:06.149 --> 12:10.274
Well, around here it was very celebrating, because there was a coup.

12:10.334 --> 12:14.759
And this basically means that Princeton will have to lay the book, too.

12:14.779 --> 12:26.532
Well, I don't know whether Bill Shady or Bill Stoneman, this isn't the sort of thing that Bill Shady would say, but Bill Stoneman would say when he's not there, that there are only two other, I think it's two other collectors who've had it.

12:26.552 --> 12:27.733
King George III and Errol Spencer.

12:27.753 --> 12:29.655
Yes, that's right.

12:29.939 --> 12:36.566
I mentioned that to Mr. Sharding as well, as so they say, because they haven't come up with any of this yet.

12:36.606 --> 12:37.227
Delightful man.

12:37.387 --> 12:39.189
Yeah, he likes to poo-poo things like that.

12:39.229 --> 12:41.031
Bob Taylor was very modest that way, too.

12:41.071 --> 12:45.295
Trying to get him to, and it's hard from my standpoint.

12:46.116 --> 12:47.457
You're talking to Bill Joyce.

12:48.679 --> 12:55.185
Terribly influential in his, I think it was his uncle, Jay Pierpont Morgan.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.087
The story I got yesterday at the Morgan.

12:58.048 --> 12:58.208
Yeah.

12:58.449 --> 12:59.710
I heard the thing they said at the Morgan.

13:00.635 --> 13:21.040
and uh basically julie is responsible for for making him a manuscript collector yeah and for for for the library on madison avenue and maybe he absolutely encouraged him to buy the very first manuscript that he bought and uh influential in about four different

13:21.222 --> 13:25.188
He also sent Belba Costa Green to him.

13:25.368 --> 13:27.351
That's one of the four major areas.

13:27.371 --> 13:30.296
As a matter of fact, he found Belbreed out here, I think.

13:30.316 --> 13:39.550
Well, he was a member of the class of 88, as was Morris Parrish, and he was an assistant librarian for the university.

13:39.910 --> 13:43.135
He was friendly with Junius, this guy Parrish?

13:43.416 --> 13:45.699
Parrish and Junius Morgan were classmen.

13:45.719 --> 13:48.343
Okay, now this helps.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.627
I'm just trying in my mind to figure out where they come in the book, that's all.

13:52.647 --> 13:54.790
I'm looking for a little avenues.

13:55.070 --> 13:55.972
Well, yeah, sure.

13:56.152 --> 14:02.581
But I lost my train of school.

14:02.641 --> 14:03.062
That's okay.

14:03.222 --> 14:06.086
You're talking about Julius and Belgrino?

14:06.106 --> 14:15.320
I guess I was just thinking that that class generated two of the great bibliophiles who were part of the Golden Age in a lot of ways.

14:15.340 --> 14:17.383
And I have a chapter on the Golden Age.

14:17.403 --> 14:17.503
Yeah.

14:17.686 --> 14:18.627
This is beautiful.

14:19.688 --> 14:31.781
This room is meant to replicate the parish's home, which was evidently across the river in New Jersey, across the river of Philadelphia in New Jersey.

14:31.801 --> 14:35.585
Boy, New Jersey had its share of important collectors filling in New Jersey.

14:36.866 --> 14:38.307
Really extraordinary.

14:38.327 --> 14:43.693
I won't bother going through them right now, even to this very day.

14:44.011 --> 14:49.239
To this very day, up in the West Country, you got two women, three women, really.

14:49.479 --> 14:50.861
Lady Eccles, Mary Hyde.

14:50.961 --> 14:52.904
Mary Hyde and Betsy Shirley.

14:52.984 --> 14:58.192
And I guess, I don't know if Violet King is a collector, really.

14:58.212 --> 15:01.117
She was one of Henry's... Betsy Shirley collects what?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.021
Children's books.

15:04.041 --> 15:04.822
She's a Beinecke.

15:04.882 --> 15:06.925
Her name is Elizabeth Beinecke.

15:06.945 --> 15:09.389
Is she a reclusive?

15:10.811 --> 15:11.272
I don't know.

15:12.193 --> 15:12.634
Not at all.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.483
Do you think she's somebody I got in contact?

15:16.045 --> 15:17.607
Well, you could certainly try.

15:17.728 --> 15:21.213
She's given her collection going to Yale.

15:22.916 --> 15:27.342
She's a pioneer.

15:27.362 --> 15:28.184
I'll take this table.

15:28.304 --> 15:29.566
I could probably do that for me.

15:29.586 --> 15:30.207
That would be great.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.114
You know what I mean.

15:35.134 --> 15:35.735
I do indeed.

15:37.258 --> 15:39.381
It may take me a minute to try this guy.

15:40.441 --> 15:48.092
That woman up there, while I'm looking here, is Sylvia Beach.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.155
Oh, Shakespeare Company.

15:50.175 --> 15:50.355
Right.

15:51.777 --> 15:54.761
And she was the daughter of, I think his name was Samuel Beach.

15:56.624 --> 15:57.505
Who lived out here.

15:57.525 --> 16:01.170
Who was the minister of the National Presbyterian Church.

16:01.190 --> 16:01.691
Sylvia Beach.

16:03.314 --> 16:07.900
And her papers are here, except for James Joyce letters that she sold to the State University in Buffalo.

16:09.078 --> 16:10.760
She was quite a nice woman.

16:10.800 --> 16:17.087
There was a lovely biography of her a couple of years ago.

16:17.207 --> 16:17.467
Yes.

16:17.568 --> 16:18.128
Yeah, there was.

16:18.709 --> 16:21.372
A pretty good book.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.053
Yeah.

16:23.094 --> 16:26.618
I love that picture, but I'm glad she's looking away from my desk.

16:26.698 --> 16:28.500
I never would have guessed who that is.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.563
I would have guessed an actress.

16:32.104 --> 16:32.284
Yeah.

16:33.158 --> 16:38.588
I could show you, we have downstairs a giant full-length portrait of her silent partner, a woman named Manier.

16:38.708 --> 16:39.950
Manier, right.

16:40.351 --> 16:40.811
Andrea?

16:41.132 --> 16:42.114
Was it Yvette, maybe?

16:43.476 --> 16:44.358
Andrea.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.705
She had the store across the street at one point, the bookstore.

16:48.926 --> 16:57.681
Well, they... And they became... Yeah, and they got friendly, and then... There were a couple... Yeah, really, Manier was really the banquet, and she was... That's the way I've been studying, anyway.

16:58.606 --> 17:03.874
Let's see, Carl Shirley, this is Carl Shirley, Post Kennel Road in Bernardsville.

17:03.995 --> 17:04.676
Post Kennel?

17:05.237 --> 17:08.983
Post, and then the second word is Kennel with one L. And the town is?

17:09.443 --> 17:13.450
Bernardsville.

17:13.470 --> 17:19.660
And there's a telephone number in the area code 201-766-1043.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.502
Does she have a zip?

17:21.523 --> 17:22.664
Maybe I'll just write her a letter?

17:22.684 --> 17:23.265
07924.

17:23.285 --> 17:26.250
079, does this spell her name for me?

17:26.872 --> 17:30.596
I'll just write her as my normal letter.

17:30.837 --> 17:33.900
Mrs. Carl Shirley, S-H-I-R-L-E-Y.

17:36.123 --> 17:39.166
Her first name is you said?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.628
Everybody calls her Betsy.

17:42.310 --> 17:43.611
I'll write her my standard letter.

17:44.633 --> 17:51.401
What can you tell me delicately or anything for the record about Mr. Scheide and Mr. Henry Bill Scheide?

17:52.842 --> 17:54.364
I think in terms of being quoted now.

18:00.183 --> 18:04.988
What does having as a collection here at Princeton mean?

18:05.008 --> 18:10.354
Well, if we're going to talk on the record, I guess... Let's do it both ways.

18:10.394 --> 18:10.774
Okay.

18:11.415 --> 18:18.863
Well, of course, the collection is a 19th century library in conception and execution.

18:18.963 --> 18:28.333
That is, it's a high-sponsed library, and as such, it covers an amazing range of subjects.

18:28.803 --> 18:38.858
and has, and by high spots we mean attracting the best, most significant books in any number of subjects.

18:38.898 --> 18:56.565
And that's one of the reasons why my quote last year about it's not, if the Friday Library has something, but what they will have value to an exhibition is because of that sense of high spots that cover, touching so many areas.

18:57.406 --> 19:08.901
The continuity of the library is what makes it so valuable, to my way of thinking, is the fact that we have three generations representing over 100 years of book collection.

19:08.921 --> 19:10.844
127, that's right.

19:11.865 --> 19:22.840
And I'm not aware of any other personal library with anything close to that as a record of continuity and effort.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.033
and accomplishments.

19:26.053 --> 19:29.637
I mean, it isn't just that they were collectors, but that they made it their life's work.

19:30.479 --> 19:36.066
Especially the son and the grandson, that is to say, joined in jail and the current leader.

19:36.086 --> 19:37.287
And the current leader, right.

19:37.948 --> 19:44.776
They have really devoted an extraordinary level of effort.

19:45.157 --> 19:52.506
And it's a great tool, the great strength of that library in its early printing, its history of early printing,

19:53.110 --> 20:03.589
will give us an enormous boost in an area where we would otherwise be relatively undistinguished, I think.

20:03.910 --> 20:13.026
And by the very presence of that library and the holdings that it has, it gives us a research resource that we're second to none.

20:13.546 --> 20:20.277
And because we're a research institution, that's .

20:20.357 --> 20:20.898
Okay.

20:20.918 --> 20:23.482
And again, this question is for quotation, all right?

20:23.502 --> 20:24.644
Yeah.

20:24.684 --> 20:27.529
Is it coming to Princeton?

20:27.809 --> 20:33.539
Give me the answer that you can give me for the quotation.

20:33.759 --> 20:36.904
The library that privately held

20:38.133 --> 20:52.976
library held by Mr. Scheide, and he has established a series of trusts and other arrangements with the university that are known to him as his lawyers, presumably.

20:52.996 --> 21:00.247
And we don't know officially what his imprecise intentions might be.

21:00.408 --> 21:02.090
It is almost a unique situation in that.

21:03.653 --> 21:06.537
Well, there's precedent that was expressed here.

21:06.972 --> 21:17.228
Yeah, as there is, I'm sure that Bill has protected himself and his interests.

21:18.029 --> 21:31.170
But when he pays for the construction of the space here in the library, just as he pays for the upkeep of it and has some kind of arrangement with the university that I'm not even aware of.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.193
And Stolen works for him.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.735
And Stolen works for him.

21:35.390 --> 21:55.462
The nice part of it is that despite the private nature of the holding, we have a complete coordination in terms of providing access to the books, to the point where if the two bills, that is Fulman and Sidi, are not here, we can get access to the collection and provide use of service.

21:55.502 --> 22:01.752
The other remarkable thing about it is that the Sidi Library holdings are in the card catalog out in front.

22:02.525 --> 22:06.572
And so they are generally available for people to use.

22:06.632 --> 22:09.336
It has to be his attitude.

22:09.356 --> 22:12.962
I mean, that's a pretty admirable attitude.

22:13.863 --> 22:17.549
He's been very good about making this stuff accessible.

22:17.629 --> 22:22.717
Yeah, and as I say, from our point of view, that's to be all in all that we do here.

22:23.018 --> 22:27.044
I mean, try and go see Mrs. Mellon's books.

22:27.185 --> 22:28.026
I couldn't even get into it.

22:28.343 --> 22:28.583
Really?

22:28.603 --> 22:29.745
This is a private library.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.690
You know, they said, you're publishing your catalogs of Yale Press.

22:33.830 --> 22:38.116
And they said that her assistant, well, this is why... Is it Dita Amery?

22:38.196 --> 22:38.837
Dita Amery.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.800
This is very much a private library.

22:41.661 --> 22:48.370
If you want to see something, write us a letter and explain why you can't get it anyplace else.

22:48.390 --> 22:52.356
Actually, we had the... Maybe that's the project, but I'll bring that in in my book.

22:52.376 --> 22:57.102
But they think that they're not going to get in, you know, by telling me to go away.

22:58.280 --> 23:03.648
She was raised in Princeton.

23:03.768 --> 23:05.450
Is that right?

23:06.051 --> 23:09.757
Bunny Mellon is, I believe, a stepdaughter of Grace Lambert.

23:10.638 --> 23:13.682
Her name is Bunny Lambert.

23:14.444 --> 23:18.129
I'm pretty sure she is.

23:18.149 --> 23:22.395
She mentions it in the preface to one of these catalogs.

23:22.415 --> 23:27.122
We did an exhibition here when the first volume of the catalog was published.

23:27.423 --> 23:28.324
It's exquisite.

23:28.404 --> 23:31.807
Have you been down there?

23:32.067 --> 23:33.749
No, I haven't.

23:33.769 --> 23:38.273
I saw it here, and at one point I thought I might... Oh, whatever.

23:38.553 --> 23:43.637
So that's for the record.

23:43.797 --> 23:44.678
The tax situation.

23:44.738 --> 23:46.440
Trust me not to use anything to embarrass you.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.742
I did trust you not.

23:48.922 --> 23:57.109
You know, I mean, if we say something's off the record, it's off the record even if it's taped.

23:58.743 --> 24:04.450
Now, that's kind of what you figure.

24:04.470 --> 24:09.237
He does have a toddler, however, who is very actively interested in books.

24:09.257 --> 24:09.437
Yes.

24:10.058 --> 24:27.400
Well, actually, Bobby is not uninterested either, but, I mean, I don't think, I think the children are unhappy, you know, that the library has reached the point where it can't continue as a kind of family resource.

24:28.544 --> 24:34.854
I mean, after all, their father, their grandfather, their great-grandfather had a role in this.

24:34.874 --> 24:43.668
It is a marvelous aspect, and they certainly would be in a position to do something on behalf of it in terms of their family.

24:43.688 --> 24:47.434
But also as a hypothetical law, you can tell it.

24:47.514 --> 24:49.677
Sure, sure.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.478
That's right.

24:50.639 --> 24:53.182
I mean, which is basically what happens.

24:53.203 --> 24:53.803
That's the rule.

24:55.126 --> 24:56.728
You know, Bradley Martin was really...

24:58.413 --> 25:00.655
where that stuff is going up.

25:00.675 --> 25:02.837
And the only reason the Archdiocese of L.A.

25:02.897 --> 25:06.720
waited 25 years is because he stipulated it.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.463
They waited 25 years, and that's not even family.

25:09.963 --> 25:13.386
And there are conflicting philosophies about that.

25:13.646 --> 25:26.698
There are people who lived in sales in the early 80s, I can't forget his name now, an Irishman, who believed that collections are formed to be broken

25:27.100 --> 25:37.211
Yeah, well, the great quote is the Robert Holmes quote, which I started the Golden Age chapter with, and it said, if it worked for other collectors, where would I have gotten my books?

25:37.231 --> 25:38.152
Right.

25:38.172 --> 25:48.264
As a justification, and you find resonances of this, right up, as recently as you remember, the Schwayen sale of the 45-year-old.

25:48.284 --> 25:50.086
Oh, right, yeah.

25:50.106 --> 25:52.368
I don't know how to pronounce it, but he said the exact same thing.

25:52.408 --> 25:54.150
Oh, I didn't mean it was Schwayen.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.692
Schwayen, Martin Schwayen.

25:55.712 --> 25:56.192
The Norwegian guy.

25:56.333 --> 25:56.753
Yeah.

25:56.834 --> 26:09.209
Except that, it would be a pity to break up those five Gutenbergs, from 42 to 36, maybe the two soldiers.

26:09.229 --> 26:21.103
I mean, they belong... Oh, it would be a pity, but, you know, I mean, that represents a certain tradition in the way... And a level of achievement as a collective, too.

26:22.484 --> 26:33.656
But look what happened, and one of the few people who held all of those was Regal Spencer, and he gave his books to an institution, and it was the institution that dispersed them.

26:33.676 --> 26:40.784
You know, the great Sylvester de Sassi quote, which I used very early in my book, nothing is serenity.

26:40.804 --> 26:47.371
He's talking, oh my golly, books, I love you, nobody's going to love you as much as that wonderful quote.

26:47.391 --> 26:49.673
The last line is,

26:50.024 --> 26:52.027
In life, nothing is certain.

26:52.047 --> 26:52.567
Nothing is.

26:53.268 --> 26:56.493
And even institutions.

26:56.513 --> 27:06.847
I mean, Harvard, I asked Farrell about the Silex Tillion, which Bill Jackson of Harvard sold to Bob Taylor.

27:07.388 --> 27:11.413
Because according to Nicholas Barker, it was such a perfect copy.

27:11.433 --> 27:12.775
And they had a duplicate, of course.

27:13.312 --> 27:17.377
The irony is, of course, when he comes back.

27:17.397 --> 27:21.822
He didn't know that story, but you're familiar with that story.

27:21.842 --> 27:22.923
Actually, no, I'm not.

27:22.983 --> 27:30.211
It didn't bear out in the... In fact, Roger started telling that story, and Barker, they both told me that story.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.052
It's a cute story.

27:31.392 --> 27:33.334
Well, I can tell you a related story.

27:33.435 --> 27:37.900
I'd like one.

27:37.940 --> 27:39.201
When the doctor's bird...

27:40.210 --> 27:42.473
were on the board of the New York Public Library.

27:42.894 --> 28:06.707
They attended a meeting one time where the trustees considered a request from Wilmoth Lewis, the great Alpol collector, and Lefty Lewis, as he was universally known, requested the library to sell him a copy of a book that he did not have in his collection.

28:07.514 --> 28:29.269
And the trustees, back in an age, in the late 30s, when things were much looser in terms of what institutions could do and what their boards and their work consultants could do, voted to sell this book to Lewis for his

28:30.363 --> 28:32.907
I guess he called it Strawberry Farm, didn't he?

28:32.967 --> 28:36.493
He called it the Lewis Walpole Collection at Strawberry Farm.

28:36.513 --> 28:37.995
He used both history and history.

28:38.055 --> 28:39.117
Yeah, it's a strawberry farm.

28:39.918 --> 28:40.519
Beautiful place.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.703
Oh, gorgeous.

28:42.723 --> 28:55.864
Well, the brothers never said a word in the course of the discussion of the meeting, but when they gave their collection to the library, they put a stipulation in the instrument, a gift.

28:56.772 --> 29:08.707
which states that should any book be alienated from the collection by the New York Public Library, the title automatically reverts to the University of Pennsylvania.

29:08.727 --> 29:10.069
Well, that echoes Peeps.

29:10.890 --> 29:11.831
Are you familiar with Peeps?

29:11.931 --> 29:15.816
Oh, the Peeps going at Cambridge.

29:16.017 --> 29:21.684
I do want some quotes on what happened to you with the Manny thing.

29:21.704 --> 29:24.147
Okay, well, let me just finish one quote, then I'll get on to that.

29:24.802 --> 29:32.834
Have you talked to the Attorney General in New York, Robert Abrams, or anybody, about regulating the auction houses?

29:32.854 --> 29:46.473
They have proposed a set of rules that affect auctions, and I would have thought they were in place by now, in the same way that they now regulate art galleries by requiring that there be a list of prices in the gallery.

29:47.394 --> 29:47.835
I don't think so.

29:48.396 --> 29:52.682
And they have proposed a set of rules, and I don't know what's happened, and I think it would be very interesting

29:53.033 --> 29:54.014
Robert Abrams, right?

29:54.395 --> 29:55.756
Yeah, he's the Attorney General.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.759
I don't think he would get to him.

29:58.799 --> 30:02.844
You know two of the biggest magic words out there in the world?

30:04.406 --> 30:05.567
A random house.

30:06.688 --> 30:09.692
It's just what you say, the smell of ink.

30:09.732 --> 30:12.515
He is a politician and he's running for office, so maybe.

30:12.855 --> 30:20.003
In any case, I think it's very important on that subject because I think the auction, the practices of the houses,

30:20.472 --> 30:30.467
are rife with... I've got Steve Manson talking on the record about this again, how they, how he sees they're losing the guidance of self peace.

30:30.487 --> 30:36.436
And of course, that competition has always been more imaginative and creative in figuring out solutions to money.

30:37.057 --> 30:39.761
Self peace does have a reputation for that.

30:39.801 --> 30:41.163
That's how they lost the sale.

30:41.543 --> 30:45.369
Self peace came in with money, upfront, real money.

30:45.830 --> 30:49.315
And now they allow the bidder to give you a line of credit.

30:50.392 --> 30:57.442
I mean, Dick Manning went and bid $2.1 million for the Shakespeare's and meant that the whole crew figured he's not worth more than $500,000.

30:57.582 --> 30:58.744
Well, why not?

30:58.824 --> 31:01.588
Selfies is what is putting up the dope.

31:01.608 --> 31:04.473
And it was a year later, two years later, he still owed them the money.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.474
So they called him in.

31:06.556 --> 31:11.302
And it was a floating reserve at that sale, by the way.

31:11.323 --> 31:11.883
I don't even know.

31:11.923 --> 31:16.109
What is a floating reserve?

31:16.130 --> 31:17.652
That's a good quote.

31:17.852 --> 31:19.234
It's important, but...

31:19.990 --> 31:26.878
It's important that institutions not confound the collecting bug with their research mission.

31:27.539 --> 31:41.575
They have to keep their eye on the prize, and the prize from an institutional perspective is maintaining these collections for their research value, not to get overtaken by what you call the gentle madness.

31:41.595 --> 31:46.521
I think that's an occupational hazard.

31:47.108 --> 32:07.952
The appeal to institutional vanity to say that you're acquiring the first book printed in English North America is tempting, but in the end, where the text is so well known, I didn't think that the information that one would be able to glean from it was sufficient to warrant that kind of price.

32:09.053 --> 32:15.681
Moreover, I'm suspicious of any object, any item that comes without a provenance.

32:16.353 --> 32:27.150
And when I heard the story that this was found in a bin in New York at the Argosy Bookstore, I said, I'm not interested in this thing, huh?

32:27.872 --> 32:32.599
Well... You know, our first thing's off the record, our other record, is this Declaration of Independence.

32:32.619 --> 32:35.604
I don't think that's a forgery, but I do think that it's a problem.

32:36.085 --> 32:39.630
I think it's an uncatalogued item out of it.

32:39.650 --> 32:40.872
That somebody ripped off.

32:40.912 --> 32:42.495
That somebody ripped off.

32:42.982 --> 32:46.928
some place like Texas or wherever, where they still have those uncatalogued things?

32:47.930 --> 32:50.374
Well, there are a lot of... That's right.

32:50.654 --> 32:59.988
I've got a story that I want to tell in my book, and I'm not going to tell it to you now, because this is a major story.

33:00.129 --> 33:07.420
Yeah, a lot of thefts, and I think that as an administrator of a fairly large collection of this sort of thing,

33:08.210 --> 33:16.461
One of the greatest worries I have is internal security, because that's where they're most vulnerable and there's no easy solution to that.

33:16.481 --> 33:19.946
You know, Roger started at Harvard and gave me three cases.

33:19.966 --> 33:26.816
One, they called them the English Deep, because he specialized in English literature, the other one, the French Deep.

33:26.836 --> 33:35.888
These were all people connected with the university who had access and knew the value of the things that they were taking, and he even gave me names and

33:36.863 --> 33:39.646
You know, there were criminal actions taken.

33:39.666 --> 33:43.331
And he basically, that's what you just said, is that this is the biggest story.

33:43.351 --> 33:45.834
People will know what the hell they're doing.

33:45.854 --> 33:46.175
Absolutely.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.656
They know their way around.

33:47.676 --> 33:47.897
Absolutely.

33:48.658 --> 33:50.960
And know how to get around security.

33:51.221 --> 34:00.272
Know how to get, and very often, you know, in my case, I'm here almost every night late, and I took the alarm, and I'm the one who,

34:01.653 --> 34:13.327
There are many ways that we could tighten up, but starting with my own activities.

34:13.927 --> 34:22.477
I'm sure we barely have a problem of internal failure.

34:22.517 --> 34:26.843
You better pretty soon, because this guy is blumbering.

34:26.883 --> 34:30.647
He's going to get out before he is.

34:31.471 --> 34:42.432
The psychologist said to me, you've got this story, but I think you've only got chapter one on him, but I don't think he's going to do books for himself.

34:42.452 --> 34:50.007
He said he apparently has skills that the criminal world is going to be attractive.

34:50.027 --> 34:53.293
But I just hope that the institutions get their houses on him.

34:53.915 --> 35:19.534
and make things a lot more difficult it's been it's been a real struggle and you know the balance that we constantly fight is access on the one side and protection on the other and the very constituency that we serve again are the people most resistant for imposing the changes that we want to protect the material and whereas the very tight

35:19.818 --> 35:28.252
Because in an academic setting like this, faculty really run the show, especially in the private research areas.

35:28.713 --> 35:38.971
And what we're about is protecting personal relationships, nurturing them so we get resources from people, and nurturing faculty to use them.

35:38.991 --> 35:43.378
And there's a self-reinforcing dynamic so that

35:43.763 --> 35:52.917
If we start tightening up, you know, people will say, well, you know, why would I want to give my things to you because you don't want to encourage their use.

35:52.997 --> 35:53.357
Okay.

35:53.738 --> 35:57.844
Now, you do have some control because you're special collections.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.186
Yes.

35:59.286 --> 36:03.252
I mean, you do have a reading room.

36:03.272 --> 36:03.412
Yes.

36:03.432 --> 36:05.295
It is kind of a control situation.

36:05.315 --> 36:06.597
It's not an open stack policy.

36:06.657 --> 36:08.079
No.

36:08.159 --> 36:11.805
Materials are brought to the individual and they don't show up.

36:11.905 --> 36:13.247
Yes, so it is.

36:13.902 --> 36:17.367
There is no control over it.

36:17.388 --> 36:17.968
Oh, yes.

36:17.988 --> 36:22.976
It's not that we're indifferent to it, but there are things we could do to tighten it.

36:22.996 --> 36:29.006
And Steven Blumberg did not hit you guys for, I don't think, six books.

36:29.026 --> 36:30.769
We evidently were, yeah.

36:31.430 --> 36:35.396
We have some general circulation books, but nothing from their books that we're aware of.

36:35.416 --> 36:41.766
Steve probably told you he would spend some time in on that in Des Moines in January checking.

36:42.438 --> 36:46.103
and did discover some general questions.

36:46.123 --> 36:50.689
But we're reasonably sure that he didn't pick it up.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.971
But we've been thinking.

36:51.991 --> 36:56.758
He went up to a dispensing party.

36:56.778 --> 37:12.259
Unless you think that institutions are completely vulnerable, I mean, there is a professional group that has, in fact, several professional groups have been revising security guidelines and practical procedures and advice for

37:12.627 --> 37:20.019
librarians and arborists tighten up to make sure that they're procedurally protected from the likes of Stevie Blumberg.

37:20.139 --> 37:34.483
And frankly, I think we do a better job protecting ourselves against outside thieves like Blumberg than we do, or the guy at Penn, the guy who just robbed the California guy.

37:34.750 --> 37:35.691
Crackpot.

37:35.751 --> 37:37.753
Not Dragner.

37:37.773 --> 37:39.494
No, no, he is Rosenbach.

37:39.975 --> 37:41.937
He gave himself a sweetheart.

37:41.957 --> 37:47.302
He's still a member of the Goliath Court, by the way, which is something... Is that right?

37:47.582 --> 37:47.822
Right.

37:47.842 --> 37:48.202
Crackpot.

37:48.222 --> 37:51.706
He admitted... He has some sort of plea bargain.

37:51.786 --> 37:55.149
...the outfark defense, and I'm going to get a copy of it.

37:55.169 --> 38:00.194
People have said if you get that, in fact, they'd all kind of like to see it.

38:00.214 --> 38:03.897
Apparently, he stipulated, he acknowledged that there's sufficient evidence

38:04.973 --> 38:08.737
for people to possibly conclude that he's guilty, but he doesn't acknowledge his guilt.

38:09.237 --> 38:09.357
Right.

38:09.377 --> 38:12.641
I've never heard of such a fine people.

38:13.281 --> 38:21.489
I mean, I know that he entered into some sort of plea bargain, but I've heard so much from that story from Ellen Dunlacher that turns it off at some point.

38:21.609 --> 38:24.812
Ellen's been a big suicide in Texas.

38:24.832 --> 38:25.433
Well, that's right.

38:25.453 --> 38:26.734
She was there.

38:27.175 --> 38:29.077
Did you ever talk to Bob Patterson?

38:29.497 --> 38:29.677
No.

38:30.518 --> 38:31.639
I don't know who he was.

38:31.859 --> 38:34.542
He's a librarian, Tulka, who was at least with Kyle Stanley.

38:35.382 --> 38:53.510
Well, yeah, they were, but Bob went to, he'd been at, well, actually, Bob Patterson is interesting because he was with Tom of Tulsa, he was with Gene Gressley of Wyoming, and he was also very much involved in the administration of HRC in the 60s.

38:54.411 --> 38:56.414
Really?

38:56.434 --> 38:56.535
Yeah.

38:56.555 --> 38:57.897
How much are these guys willing to say?

38:59.539 --> 38:59.680
Mm-hmm.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.963
How much are these guys willing to say as, uh,

39:02.095 --> 39:02.615
I don't know.

39:02.796 --> 39:04.757
Bob might be pretty tight into it.

39:04.858 --> 39:07.220
I've got some good people in Texas.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.122
I've talked to Warren Robbins.

39:09.142 --> 39:14.487
I've talked to John Silver.

39:14.507 --> 39:14.867
Did you?

39:16.869 --> 39:17.910
How about Vaughtan?

39:17.950 --> 39:19.892
Did he know anything about that?

39:19.912 --> 39:23.815
I've just recently been told that maybe I should talk to him more.

39:24.356 --> 39:28.980
What I find so interesting about Texas is that the three neoconservatives

39:29.770 --> 39:34.857
Silver, Gregoria, and Bill Bennett were at Texas all at the same time.

39:34.957 --> 39:39.283
And they apparently had some joint activity.

39:39.303 --> 39:41.106
Well, Silver, of course, is the big one.

39:41.126 --> 39:42.568
He was the heir apparent.

39:43.349 --> 39:43.990
Yeah, yeah.

39:44.931 --> 39:45.872
And he got fired.

39:45.932 --> 39:46.593
Frank Irwin.

39:47.234 --> 39:49.818
His obit is on his way to me as we speak.

39:49.858 --> 39:52.882
I'm writing that chapter right now.

39:52.902 --> 39:55.305
That's a pretty good chapter.

39:56.011 --> 40:03.819
Well, Patterson, I don't know if he'd be willing to talk about it, but that would be a more operational point of view.

40:03.959 --> 40:04.680
I'm going to talk to you.

40:04.740 --> 40:08.785
I'm going to talk to James Richner.

40:09.605 --> 40:10.827
In fact, his aide is at Austin.

40:10.907 --> 40:13.249
What he gave us his office at HRC.

40:13.269 --> 40:16.273
Apparently Harry Rantz chimed in the way he charmed everybody else.

40:18.054 --> 40:22.339
I don't have any impropriety, but I have a hell of a story.

40:22.825 --> 40:45.087
The problem with Texas is that they were driven to try to accomplish more than their resources would permit.

40:45.303 --> 40:49.687
There's a sort of collective inferiority complex that I think led to judgments.

40:49.987 --> 40:51.569
Do you know what the title of my chapter is there?

40:51.649 --> 40:52.089
Did I tell you?

40:52.189 --> 40:52.409
No.

40:52.630 --> 40:53.430
Instant Ivy.

40:54.131 --> 40:55.552
Oh, yes, you did say that, yeah.

40:55.572 --> 40:57.014
The political title?

40:57.534 --> 40:59.056
Yes, I did.

40:59.096 --> 41:01.998
They tried to achieve Instant Ivy, and that's a phrase I got out of there.

41:03.179 --> 41:10.886
And if you see some of the things that they did, you know, I think are very questionable, even down to the recent past, I think are very questionable.

41:10.906 --> 41:12.588
A lot of jokes.

41:12.608 --> 41:13.909
Yeah, a lot of bilge.

41:14.362 --> 41:20.209
I asked Roger Kennedy, just chatting with him, and he said, well, yeah, but he said there's an argument for junk.

41:20.229 --> 41:28.579
He said, you can't, sometimes you can't appreciate the masterpiece and you can, unless he can see all these things with me to the, you know, that's it.

41:28.619 --> 41:31.423
Well, all right, that's what someone wants to say.

41:31.643 --> 41:33.265
But I'm addressing the subject of junk.

41:33.285 --> 41:43.137
Yeah, and I think that the, and they were so driven to accumulate, to try to show their sort of institutional presence and work, you know, that they went too far.

41:43.302 --> 41:48.867
Well, I opened this chapter with stuff coming in, and there's no place to put it.

41:49.688 --> 41:52.730
Physically, literally, they didn't know where to put it.

41:52.750 --> 41:53.951
They stuck it in the tower.

41:54.372 --> 42:00.357
Well, that's why I mentioned Bob Patterson, because he, I think, dealt with some of those.

42:00.377 --> 42:01.858
Do you remember Bob Patterson?

42:01.939 --> 42:02.759
I think he would.

42:02.859 --> 42:05.322
I'm not quite sure when he went there.

42:05.402 --> 42:06.683
He's in Tulsa now.

42:06.703 --> 42:08.044
He's a librarian in Tulsa.

42:11.087 --> 42:12.668
I think he's two years older than I am.

42:13.998 --> 42:16.261
Yeah, he wouldn't be there.

42:16.321 --> 42:17.242
He wouldn't have been there then.

42:18.063 --> 42:23.751
Harry Ransom started in 57 in those real frenetic years, rather, in the early 60s.

42:23.771 --> 42:30.219
Yeah, well, let's say he graduated from college in 58 or 60, got his library degree in 62.

42:30.239 --> 42:31.360
He'd have been there.

42:32.802 --> 42:33.844
He'd have been there.

42:33.864 --> 42:35.646
Must be a fun chapter.

42:35.666 --> 42:37.048
I mean, I don't know.

42:37.288 --> 42:42.655
He might not have been involved in the way that I think he was, but I thought

42:42.854 --> 42:45.658
I remembered Bob Patterson.

42:45.678 --> 42:46.799
Robert Patterson.

42:46.819 --> 42:48.702
With a phone call, for sure.

42:48.722 --> 42:56.392
And I'm going to see if I can see Bob, just because he's so articulate anyway, just to talk about books.

42:56.412 --> 42:57.353
And I'm going to get out of J.C.

42:57.373 --> 42:58.935
Brown anyway.

42:59.115 --> 43:03.601
You won't get anything out of Bob Patterson?

43:04.522 --> 43:05.944
You don't think so?

43:05.984 --> 43:07.326
How did he leave Texas?

43:09.736 --> 43:11.618
Oh, that was all right.

43:11.638 --> 43:13.179
Yeah, better than U.S.

43:13.240 --> 43:13.500
Penn.

43:13.800 --> 43:19.045
I followed into New York Public by a month.

43:19.065 --> 43:27.934
I talked to Bernie McKeegan a year-and-a-half or so ago, and then he was just going to Florida, so I had my wife and kids down there.

43:27.975 --> 43:29.876
That's what I wanted to see.

43:29.896 --> 43:31.658
He's got an interesting children's book collection.

43:31.959 --> 43:33.881
Yes, he does.

43:34.141 --> 43:38.325
Yeah, they have the Sydney

43:39.318 --> 43:48.430
I think they only really see the revolving collection, but that's what they got, I think.

43:48.450 --> 43:51.694
But it's interesting, they bring him in to... Let me ask you a question now.

43:51.814 --> 43:57.221
Emory University gets 250 million Coca-Cola dollars.

43:57.762 --> 44:08.295
I wonder, with the mandate to become a great university, and they've just taken half of Hopkins' French department, the entire French department, half of the graduates, that's been a bigger thing.

44:08.933 --> 44:12.858
Do they then go out and try and build special collections?

44:12.878 --> 44:15.902
Well, I know the special collection person there.

44:16.382 --> 44:20.487
They certainly have Linda Matthews.

44:20.507 --> 44:24.212
I just spoke to her last week about it.

44:24.312 --> 44:28.277
Do you think that's a worthwhile question to ask?

44:28.738 --> 44:36.207
With the money that they have, if you want to become first-rate, if you want to become a Princeton or a Yale or a Harvard or a Texas,

44:36.575 --> 44:40.020
You have to have the material to attract scholars, isn't that right?

44:40.581 --> 44:41.722
Does that follow?

44:42.343 --> 44:48.411
Or is that simplistic?

44:48.431 --> 44:50.835
No, all universities have to do it at some level.

44:54.179 --> 45:06.396
I think, in the case of Emory, that they've had some modest successes in that area, but I don't think it's pretty pretty distinguished.

45:06.916 --> 45:09.640
but they have the money, which they do.

45:09.700 --> 45:13.385
There was a big piece in the Times a year or so ago.

45:13.545 --> 45:30.589
They have the money programmatically for developing the university generally, but whether they have it specifically dedicated for rare books, most of the great collections are the result of individual benefactions.

45:30.629 --> 45:31.831
There's no question.

45:31.851 --> 45:33.273
Say that again.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.197
Most of the great collections

45:36.717 --> 45:43.605
are the results of individual benefactions, whether of money or of materials.

45:46.187 --> 45:48.670
So that's one of the presses of my book?

45:48.690 --> 45:48.850
Yeah.

45:50.252 --> 45:50.452
Basically.

45:50.472 --> 45:51.293
People don't know that.

45:52.114 --> 45:56.299
The whole New York Public Library is a collection of wonderful collections.

45:56.319 --> 45:58.741
You could say that at any distinguished library.

45:58.982 --> 46:02.345
But even the New York Public Library as an institution is not a public library.

46:02.445 --> 46:02.505
No.

46:02.525 --> 46:03.907
I didn't realize that either.

46:03.927 --> 46:04.688
Oh, no, that's right.

46:04.728 --> 46:06.690
Well, it's public in the 19th century sense.

46:07.160 --> 46:13.586
It's the most complicated institution I have ever been associated with and ever hoped to be associated with.

46:13.606 --> 46:18.550
It is absolutely Byzantine as government.

46:18.670 --> 46:36.947
I mean, it has patterns of, you know, the whole structure, the contract between, the 99-year contract between the board and the city for the public library part of the public library, that is to say the circulating branches in the three boroughs, is in itself

46:37.282 --> 46:49.456
a model of complexity if you wanted to know how to make a difficult situation, tangled situation, you know, even more so.

46:49.476 --> 46:54.301
One day last summer I wanted to go in and take a look at the tobacco thing, you know, the events thing.

46:54.441 --> 46:57.985
And it's been open until noon on a weekday.

46:59.647 --> 47:04.933
I was part of my bailiwick when I was there, and I think part of that problem now is the hours are coming back.

47:05.594 --> 47:06.495
That's the danger.

47:07.015 --> 47:10.479
of that kind of collecting of individuals.

47:11.160 --> 47:34.727
Sometimes the interests are, when they're institutionalized, what is a kind of natural, if somewhat idiosyncratic expression of enthusiasm becomes, in an institutional setting, whimsical and dangerously subversive.

47:35.500 --> 47:41.690
And the reason I say that is here's a man who was the son of a tobacco heiress in Virginia.

47:43.073 --> 47:46.519
It made all the sense in the world for him to buy whatever he wanted to.

47:46.539 --> 47:54.673
It was tobacco related, so he bought books that had, you know, early herbals that described tobacco plants, manuscripts, etc.

47:54.693 --> 48:00.703
Well, there's a letter from Sir Walter Raleigh or something, which, you know, makes sense.

48:00.723 --> 48:00.883
It does.

48:01.133 --> 48:10.643
And then he gave his collection and a pot of money to NYPL and other institutions benefited from his generosity.

48:11.284 --> 48:20.894
Nobody in the world, and I would be the last to criticize him for having done that, but you put the tobacco collection in the context of New York Public Special Collections.

48:20.914 --> 48:29.183
And Bernie is a very good example of somebody who had responsibility for that, who had, I think,

48:30.547 --> 48:39.420
done as well with it as one could do with it, but he bought Dr. Gachet, a print by Van Gogh, because Dr. Gachet is smoking a pint.

48:40.161 --> 48:42.405
But they have that show here and after.

48:42.425 --> 48:43.526
Yeah, yeah.

48:43.546 --> 48:57.988
He bought, well, Bernie didn't buy it, but the library bought a manuscript by William Faulkner, that's the first story of the Father Abraham, which we published and got the... Check that one.

48:58.070 --> 48:59.132
Did you, really?

48:59.152 --> 49:01.796
I saw it the day I saw it in the New York Times, I called.

49:02.537 --> 49:03.799
No kidding.

49:03.839 --> 49:07.384
You were one of the ones who created all those problems for us.

49:07.605 --> 49:13.373
Well, problems in the revised sense.

49:13.394 --> 49:15.697
In some respects, that was one of the great moments there.

49:17.119 --> 49:19.603
That's a very important fragment.

49:19.623 --> 49:20.905
Well, let me finish.

49:21.442 --> 49:33.834
The story how the library acquired it, it may be that there's some suggestion that the manuscript was stolen from Faulkner by his agent, but that's off the record.

49:33.854 --> 49:39.920
I don't want you to... It's off the record for anybody.

49:39.941 --> 49:40.701
What do you think of that?

49:40.721 --> 49:46.547
Well, Eddie Wolfe, for instance, collected American book linings.

49:46.567 --> 49:51.432
Apparently, that had nothing to do with the collections of the library company in Philadelphia.

49:51.682 --> 50:01.414
One of the problems in the recent past is the run-up of value of collections that we manage.

50:01.434 --> 50:19.056
And I think that run-up in the value of these collections poses difficulty in the relationship between an individual employee and an institution where the individual collects in the same area that the institution is forming collections.

50:20.386 --> 50:43.628
that is an area that is right for conflict of interest and I think that we have a professional obligation to draw up guidelines that will enable us to get around that problem so that we won't put ourselves in the appearance of being in a conflict of interest.

50:43.688 --> 50:48.553
There was a minor scandal at the University of Texas where I believe

50:49.107 --> 51:16.633
Well, there are many other areas of conflict that have to do with relationships with dealers, exchanges, using institutional funds to purchase personal

51:17.255 --> 51:23.064
Acquisitions, even when there's an intention to reimburse the institution, there's a commingling effect.

51:23.504 --> 51:29.373
All of this, I think, is the grounds for misunderstanding what the appropriate relationship is.

51:29.393 --> 51:41.311
What do you do in a case, and I'll just throw this out as an example, but at the University of Texas again, Cotton Lake is curator of a Cotton Lake collection.

51:41.331 --> 51:47.059
At Yale, the collector of the Great Greta collection was the curator of that collection until he died.

51:47.410 --> 51:51.917
There is a tradition, and a very honorable tradition.

51:52.799 --> 52:06.701
The best example I can think of is Philip Holford at Harvard, whose personal involvement and formation of a collection that he left for the institution would be harmed by what I'm suggesting.

52:06.721 --> 52:13.772
But in an age of commercialization, where the cash nexus forms so much

52:14.292 --> 52:36.012
And where we are in the great age of accountability, where the public purse, whether it be in the form of outright funding or subsidization through tax benefits, means that in order to be appropriately accountable, I think we have to separate ourselves as individuals and our collecting interests from our institutional obligations.

52:36.032 --> 52:39.455
I just think it's in the air and a part of the time we live in.

52:39.535 --> 52:42.578
And I think you did indicate that you are working on a code of ethics.

52:42.828 --> 52:43.669
For whom again?

52:43.689 --> 52:52.424
Yes, for the Red Books and Manuscripts section of the Association of College and Research Libraries, which is a division of the American Libraries.

52:52.524 --> 52:53.806
And this is in progress.

52:53.826 --> 52:54.968
It's in progress.

52:55.008 --> 52:59.836
The draft has been published and is being now re-edited and revised.

52:59.976 --> 53:04.684
Do you address these other little, like the Philip Holford situation, kind of situation?

53:05.390 --> 53:08.434
Because that isn't quite an exception to what you're talking about.

53:08.694 --> 53:25.215
Well, nobody wants to say, and I don't believe the statement goes so far as to say that personal collecting should be prohibited, but there are practices within that where we attempt to provide some guidelines to give individuals guidance in their conduct.

53:25.996 --> 53:32.224
We certainly take a dim view of dealing, that institutional employees should not be dealers.

53:33.132 --> 53:58.903
um there are this problem is by the way being dealt with in a very direct way by the american museum association or the american association museums where the institution is always given the right of first refusal for any purchase made by an employee in an area that the institution collects um and yeah and it's because that we have this problem of appearances to cope with

53:59.710 --> 54:08.659
I don't know that I could continue to afford to do it, but at one time I was actively involved in forming a collection of 19th century advice books.

54:08.679 --> 54:15.887
And I have more or less laid that aside now because I've just gotten to the point where I felt uncomfortable with it.

54:15.927 --> 54:21.252
And very little things happened in terms of relations with dealers.

54:21.352 --> 54:28.840
What I could buy for $25, if a dealer felt he was going to get on my better side by giving me a $75 item,

54:29.343 --> 54:43.922
you know, which might be triple what I could have afforded, but they feel that it's going to give them an inside track, maybe to get an option commission for an item that would be hundreds of times that, maybe even more.

54:44.843 --> 54:50.331
I'm putting myself and my integrity and that of the institution at risk.

54:51.132 --> 54:56.018
Before we get off on this, you were telling me about the IRS.

54:56.058 --> 54:58.361
You never finished what you were saying.

54:58.381 --> 54:58.962
Well, just the...

54:59.330 --> 55:12.661
Well, what I started to say was that, and then when the Father Abraham manuscript came from George Duchenes, who was a New York manuscripts deal, the reason why was that there's a reference on the first page to Flem Snopes chewing tobacco.

55:13.642 --> 55:20.408
Well, that kind of reason gets awfully whimsical in my opinion.

55:20.428 --> 55:24.111
And there's no other Faulkner manuscripts in the collection.

55:25.672 --> 55:28.695
And so you begin to get some institutional oddments

55:29.266 --> 55:31.549
because you have the money to film it.

55:31.569 --> 55:36.876
And maybe it does belong in Oxford, Mississippi, or Virginia, or Texas, which has the premier.

55:36.896 --> 55:49.112
Oh, Virginia is where the... Yeah, and so I think that in an instance like that, and I don't mean to pick on the New York Public Library.

55:49.172 --> 55:52.776
God knows I've worked there for a couple of years, and I really love it.

55:53.557 --> 55:57.062
But yeah, it's an example, and I think that...

55:58.325 --> 56:01.068
It poses the kind of difficulty.

56:01.328 --> 56:03.310
That may even impede scholarship.

56:04.131 --> 56:10.457
If somebody's working on Faulkner, you want to go where the stuff is.

56:10.537 --> 56:15.282
Now I have to go running up to New York to look at this one thing.

56:15.622 --> 56:23.910
But on the other hand, I can tell you how that one manuscript, I alluded to my publication of success there,

56:24.413 --> 56:34.685
Two printers came in and they said they had always derived so much benefit from the rare book room by studying design examples and old books and so on.

56:34.705 --> 56:37.749
They wanted to print a book and sell it for the benefit of the library.

56:37.769 --> 56:38.810
Red Osier is the one who got it.

56:39.251 --> 56:43.015
And Red Osier Press, Steve Miller, and Ken Botkin's book.

56:43.035 --> 56:46.800
And Bernie was the one who suggested that they do the Faulkner manuscript.

56:46.820 --> 56:48.522
And we got Jill Summers' permission.

56:48.542 --> 56:49.783
We told her what we were doing.

56:51.025 --> 56:53.948
And we had it printed.

56:55.852 --> 57:01.077
Herbert Mitgang wrote a long article in The Times on the day of publication.

57:01.198 --> 57:06.523
He caught wind of it, came down and talked to us.

57:06.643 --> 57:16.253
All hell broke loose on that day because it was a page one story on Wednesday, and Wednesday is the second greatest circulation of the New York Times.

57:16.273 --> 57:16.854
Did you know that?

57:17.334 --> 57:18.155
Wednesdays?

57:18.175 --> 57:20.057
No, but... And you know why?

57:20.097 --> 57:22.520
It's a very prosaic reason.

57:22.680 --> 57:23.901
It's the food coupon day.

57:25.248 --> 57:32.879
And that story on that day created that we had a deluge of orders to pull the book out in a day.

57:33.339 --> 57:36.463
I figured it was sold by 11.30 a.m.

57:36.684 --> 57:37.845
I don't know if that's quite true.

57:38.286 --> 57:39.307
Well, I know.

57:39.347 --> 57:42.332
I saw the thing at that time.

57:42.352 --> 57:43.413
I started working at 7 a.m.

57:43.473 --> 57:44.434
and I read the Times.

57:44.675 --> 57:46.217
So I had a jump on everybody.

57:47.078 --> 57:49.922
I was actually among the very first callers.

57:50.324 --> 57:55.008
Well, we had, when that story hit, we had dealers calling, reserving ten times.

57:55.028 --> 57:56.610
And you admitted two, I think.

57:56.630 --> 57:58.832
And we, I think, well, I forget, two or four.

57:59.292 --> 58:17.749
But the poor guy, Jordan Davies, his name was, who was the distributor, bookseller in lower Manhattan, he had, he created for that poor man a terrible public relations problem with his colleagues, because they all wanted to order books, and he was on the strict orders not to do that.

58:18.607 --> 58:21.652
And then the media got into it, you know, and I get calls.

58:21.712 --> 58:22.514
Are you William Joyce?

58:22.554 --> 58:24.377
Are you responsible for this?

58:24.517 --> 58:25.719
Did you say this?

58:26.240 --> 58:28.404
I mean, I didn't know what I was doing at one point.

58:29.045 --> 58:31.710
I was interviewed on NPR, and I started getting calls from that.

58:31.770 --> 58:33.152
I got one very easily.

58:34.575 --> 58:35.216
I'm sorry?

58:35.236 --> 58:36.358
I got one very easily.

58:36.438 --> 58:39.684
Well, yeah, I mean, it wasn't that you called that day, though.

58:40.165 --> 58:42.589
I called within minutes of reading it.

58:43.075 --> 58:45.197
at 7 o'clock in the morning.

58:45.237 --> 58:49.101
I started work before everybody else had a chance to read their times.

58:49.762 --> 58:51.283
I acted immediately on it.

58:51.303 --> 58:52.665
I didn't wait to see it.

58:52.765 --> 58:58.831
I want to tell you that the stories that that project created was unbelievable.

58:59.151 --> 59:04.277
The worries, the problems.

59:04.377 --> 59:07.079
Every step of the way, the editor and the printers fought.

59:07.440 --> 59:08.661
They fought like Hasmold.

59:09.400 --> 59:10.581
How did the Trade Edition do?

59:10.621 --> 59:12.383
How did the Trade Edition do?

59:13.024 --> 59:13.605
Pretty well.

59:15.066 --> 59:20.272
That's when I started to deal with Jason Epstein, actually, because of that.

59:20.353 --> 59:25.278
Right before I left the library, we tried to see if there were other joint projects.

59:25.538 --> 59:27.401
Nothing much happened when I left.

59:27.541 --> 59:28.702
How long were you there, by the way?

59:28.722 --> 59:29.323
About five years.

59:29.343 --> 59:32.927
Do you have a little thing that I can have that gives me a background on you?

59:33.027 --> 59:33.327
On me?

59:33.668 --> 59:33.928
Yeah.

59:34.409 --> 59:36.471
In fact, I can put it up on computer.

59:37.447 --> 59:42.577
By the way, what time does Bill Stolman leave by there?

59:42.677 --> 59:44.360
Because I've got a bunch of stuff.

59:44.380 --> 59:44.781
About 5 o'clock.

59:44.801 --> 59:47.706
Okay, so I love that time.

59:47.726 --> 59:50.311
I've got my camera and briefcase and stuff.

59:50.331 --> 59:52.134
That's probably the time I want to get him.

59:52.275 --> 59:53.417
I'm driving back.

59:54.819 --> 59:55.440
To Massachusetts?

59:55.461 --> 59:55.881
Yeah.

59:56.903 --> 59:57.885
No problem.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:03.391
Well, anyway, we had, oh, the trade edition.

01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:08.698
Well, the Random House got into the act, and they said, well, of course, we have the rights to this.

01:00:08.718 --> 01:00:09.079
They do?

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.621
They claim the rights to it.

01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:11.002
Why?

01:00:11.242 --> 01:00:14.988
Because it was a part of the Snopes trilogy.

01:00:15.348 --> 01:00:16.870
It was really part of the novel.

01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:18.833
It was advanced later in the novel The Village.

01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:20.556
They had a legitimate claim.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:26.725
I didn't think they did, because we got permission from Jill to publish the manuscript, which was the basis of both.

01:00:27.515 --> 01:00:30.519
and it was different from what the Virgin was doing.

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:33.062
So Jason was just firing a shot there.

01:00:34.123 --> 01:00:38.990
I think he just wanted to lob one across our bow, you know.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.634
We had a lunch that was kind of interesting.

01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:50.905
Jason and Tony, something rather high enough, his brother-in-law, no, no, well, I forget.

01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:53.488
Bennett Serf's son-in-law.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.970
Tony Widkheimer, who was the production guy there.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.812
Anyway, they came down.

01:00:59.832 --> 01:01:03.321
We kind of had negotiation over them once.

01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:04.985
It worked out fine.

01:01:05.085 --> 01:01:07.090
Actually, it worked out better than fine because they gave a...
