WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:05.150
He's still working in Cambridge.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.573
He runs the... This is Larry Rosenberg.

00:07.593 --> 00:08.534
Larry Rosenberg.

00:08.554 --> 00:09.855
He's at 331 Broadway.

00:10.676 --> 00:12.718
And he runs the Zen Institute at Cambridge.

00:12.738 --> 00:16.662
I'm not sure whether it's called the Zen Institute or the... It's right across the street from Haven's house, isn't it?

00:17.162 --> 00:17.683
Did you see it?

00:17.863 --> 00:18.083
Yeah.

00:18.464 --> 00:19.404
That's the same place.

00:19.424 --> 00:20.586
Yeah, but he's there.

00:20.926 --> 00:26.311
They split under... I always assumed Haven was connected with them.

00:26.331 --> 00:28.954
Yeah, they were connected in the Brandeis place.

00:28.974 --> 00:32.097
And then there was a split... What the hell was going on at Brandeis?

00:32.954 --> 00:34.576
That's where the recruiting was going on.

00:34.817 --> 00:39.764
Part Shackley, part... part Fermor himself.

00:41.386 --> 00:48.757
Um, I'm just reading through, hang on.

00:48.777 --> 00:49.899
Barry Taylor.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.241
Nope.

00:51.261 --> 00:52.883
He's a naturopathic physician.

00:52.903 --> 00:53.684
He's ex-S.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.927
He was a contemporary of Casper's University.

00:56.608 --> 00:57.329
He's now in Washington.

00:57.570 --> 00:58.471
I have a number for him.

00:58.491 --> 00:59.613
I also have a number for Rosenberg.

00:59.633 --> 01:00.514
I've found Rosenberg.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.297
I'm hoping there's a message when I get back tonight.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.120
Maybe I can talk to him before I leave.

01:05.801 --> 01:06.422
Robin Green.

01:07.324 --> 01:07.504
Nope.

01:08.406 --> 01:08.887
Rahel.

01:10.589 --> 01:12.152
They're the same person.

01:12.953 --> 01:17.481
I think that's an ex-girlfriend of either Waxman or Casper.

01:17.501 --> 01:18.242
It's in here somewhere.

01:18.723 --> 01:21.849
She's now Hogan's companion, housemaid.

01:23.612 --> 01:24.493
Her name's Robin Green.

01:24.946 --> 01:27.009
Robin Green.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.213
Yeah, I assume the voice on the answer phone belongs to all the calls.

01:30.233 --> 01:31.615
Oh, so there's a new... Robin Green.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.497
Her name is Rahel.

01:33.517 --> 01:35.560
She only answers to Rahel, then.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.302
How do we spell Rahel, would you say?

01:37.322 --> 01:40.747
Well, I put it down as R-A-H-E-L.

01:40.767 --> 01:46.394
It might be J. Oh, it could be R-A-Q-U-E-L.

01:47.836 --> 01:50.019
And Mark Blumenthal.

01:50.419 --> 01:51.941
Also ex-boyfriend of Robin Green.

01:51.961 --> 01:53.864
Doctor in New Jersey, ex-Brandeis.

01:53.884 --> 01:54.244
These are...

01:55.237 --> 01:58.401
He remembers a lot of the people he was at Brandeis with.

01:58.421 --> 02:02.466
This is why I'm hoping some of those names... Was it Robin Antoine?

02:02.486 --> 02:04.708
And the other one?

02:04.748 --> 02:06.270
Robert Oates.

02:06.290 --> 02:11.016
You have to have a sense, in my view, of where this would go, though.

02:11.036 --> 02:11.256
Yes.

02:11.497 --> 02:16.222
For your purposes, where would this be going?

02:16.603 --> 02:24.332
Well, I'm beginning to come around to the stories that the books are important.

02:24.734 --> 02:26.758
But certainly not overriding.

02:26.998 --> 02:32.788
The central thrust of the story is Omar versus Davis.

02:32.908 --> 02:34.291
I would think so, yeah.

02:35.853 --> 02:42.785
And Haven's view of his life as opposed to the view of his life that we can ascertain independent of.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.936
But the more people we talk to, it's about that.

02:49.338 --> 02:52.663
Will you visualize it?

02:52.683 --> 02:54.206
An hour documentary?

02:54.346 --> 02:56.790
If it's on BBC, it would probably be 50 minutes.

02:56.870 --> 03:02.439
If it's on Channel 4, it would probably be 50 minutes.

03:02.619 --> 03:11.734
Seeing this thing, I mean, kind of visualize it as a drama, as a documentary.

03:13.553 --> 03:19.378
The occasion for it, certainly, is this spectacular sale of books, how it was put together.

03:19.578 --> 03:20.379
Yeah.

03:20.439 --> 03:22.201
That's the centerpiece.

03:22.261 --> 03:24.303
I think that's where it would start.

03:25.704 --> 03:43.560
That you would lead your audience into believing that this was going to be an introduction to a rather arcane, mysterious world, where it holds lots of money, lots of high finance, high rollers, and that it would turn, or it seems to be turned, into something rather

03:46.645 --> 03:51.451
And so, what's his attitude?

03:52.192 --> 03:54.395
How did you pitch it to him, just out of curiosity?

03:55.156 --> 03:56.177
Why would he want to do this?

03:56.518 --> 04:06.731
I sent him a letter asking for a meeting, saying that I'd read about his collection, about how he put it together.

04:07.252 --> 04:09.314
I thought it would make an interesting documentary.

04:09.334 --> 04:15.943
I was even more convinced it would make an interesting documentary when I heard that there was a lot of unpublished material.

04:16.244 --> 04:29.578
he's been a yogi, that he's been, you know, and that I'm, you know, if he was interested in having, you know, a monument to his life, then here's an opportunity.

04:29.598 --> 04:30.199
That could do it.

04:34.564 --> 04:34.744
Yeah.

04:36.426 --> 04:40.430
Which is, I mean, you know, when I wrote that letter, that's exactly what I was looking to do.

04:40.470 --> 04:45.255
Obviously, I was playing a little to his ego, a little to his vanity.

04:45.775 --> 04:54.063
I just want to make sure I didn't give you this one document I am looking for, and I can't find it, and I know I wanted you to have it.

04:54.083 --> 04:59.309
Not in the red file, because I know it's in there, but just of all the other stuff we did.

05:00.129 --> 05:15.765
Yeah, I haven't done that yet, but I'm just... I mean, the answer to your question at the moment is I don't know, because every time I speak to someone, I get more information that skews it away from the original

05:16.167 --> 05:17.649
documentary that I envisaged.

05:20.872 --> 05:27.639
This didn't just come out so good.

05:27.659 --> 05:31.223
That's a troll of stuff, my friend.

05:32.024 --> 05:34.787
Are you okay?

05:34.847 --> 05:37.530
Are you sure?

05:37.550 --> 05:39.812
I look at it and say, I just know how...

05:40.147 --> 05:41.609
the work that went into getting on.

05:42.310 --> 05:43.592
People don't appreciate it.

05:43.612 --> 05:45.715
They see a sheet of papers.

05:47.898 --> 05:56.331
But I think, to me, what comes back is the obstacles that I faced, the opposition, the intimidation.

05:57.312 --> 06:01.899
To have this lawyer, my brother went in there.

06:01.939 --> 06:02.940
He's an attorney.

06:04.543 --> 06:07.447
We still didn't know what was going on.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.128
And she

06:08.345 --> 06:13.451
I threw him out of her office, screamed at him, and said, I will not talk to you.

06:13.471 --> 06:14.032
Hysterical.

06:14.352 --> 06:14.672
Really?

06:15.654 --> 06:15.754
Yeah.

06:15.774 --> 06:18.337
I just judged.

06:18.357 --> 06:21.721
It took me to believe that she was feeling a lot of pressure.

06:22.962 --> 06:27.307
She, by the way, was appointed by Michael Dukakis, her cousin.

06:28.549 --> 06:30.932
He was the former governor of Massachusetts.

06:30.952 --> 06:33.615
He ran for president in 1980.

06:33.635 --> 06:34.676
He ran against Bush.

06:35.877 --> 06:37.339
She was appointed by her cousin.

06:38.365 --> 06:42.854
I don't want to comment on what kind of a judge she was.

06:42.874 --> 06:54.335
I'm certainly not a legal analyst, but she didn't comport herself very critically as far as I'm concerned in this affair.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.445
For reasons that escaped me, this case was made

07:01.231 --> 07:08.422
She took place to all attempts to prison as an almost unprecedented act to totally impound a case.

07:11.787 --> 07:14.131
Did you get the Certificate of Limited Partnership?

07:14.472 --> 07:14.752
I did.

07:17.216 --> 07:22.805
I will copy it.

07:22.825 --> 07:23.345
Oh yeah, you can add this.

07:23.365 --> 07:24.387
The last time

07:24.923 --> 07:38.705
Jim Casper had any professional dealings with Avon O'Moore was when O'Moore bought the whole of the Concord Street and Garden Street block of the Arsenal Square thing.

07:39.967 --> 07:46.837
And he needed help with the rent board, the rent control board.

07:48.961 --> 07:49.902
He wanted to take

07:50.371 --> 07:53.355
two of the houses he bought down.

07:53.456 --> 07:55.539
He did it, he actually did it.

07:55.559 --> 07:59.585
And yeah, he plowed a... This was a historic district.

07:59.605 --> 08:06.775
Yeah, Jim says he plowed a bulldozer through the two houses when permission wasn't granted to him.

08:06.835 --> 08:08.257
This was a historic district.

08:08.358 --> 08:09.059
Yeah.

08:09.379 --> 08:13.505
They weren't raised to the ground, but they were rendered uninhabitable, so they had to be destroyed.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.266
Which is what he wanted.

08:14.487 --> 08:16.630
Yeah.

08:16.650 --> 08:17.391
And...

08:18.400 --> 08:25.110
Jim says that he helped Hayden find the lawyers that kept him out of prison, basically.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.192
Well, he wouldn't have gone to prison.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.095
Well, that's an imprisonable offence.

08:28.115 --> 08:33.964
But I don't think it was... He certainly could have been sued.

08:33.984 --> 08:36.928
He could have had this tremendous crime.

08:37.089 --> 08:44.901
He's got some... He had tapes of O'Moore lecturing in the Brandeis case.

08:44.921 --> 08:45.842
O'Moore took them back.

08:47.155 --> 08:53.044
But he does have transcripts from the tapes, which... Again, you know, it all depends on where you're going.

08:54.086 --> 08:58.733
No, I mean, I just find it, I mean, that sort of stuff isn't going to find its way into a final thing.

08:58.854 --> 09:10.552
I just find it fascinating because with luck, you'll be able to find there exactly what it was that drew so many people to him and kept them there.

09:10.572 --> 09:13.517
I mean, he must have had something as a showman to get.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.727
that sort of attention from so many ostensibly intelligent people.

09:18.747 --> 09:21.412
And in the case of at least one, getting to hand over millions of dollars.

09:25.839 --> 09:27.442
Well, I can't find this document.

09:27.462 --> 09:29.165
This is the last file I'm going to go through.

09:30.907 --> 09:31.308
Which one?

09:32.069 --> 09:34.914
It's the parking space one.

09:35.034 --> 09:40.163
And it's wonderful because it was the first time

09:41.138 --> 09:51.828
I had seen in black and white that it was DBA, doing business as, uh, care of, it was care of, a P.O.

09:51.848 --> 09:54.150
box in Millerton, New York.

09:54.170 --> 09:59.675
And that's the document that gets me and sends me to Millerton.

09:59.695 --> 10:04.219
You know, that's the one that tells you that he's buried his name.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.280
I can't find it.

10:05.300 --> 10:05.741
You know that?

10:06.441 --> 10:07.282
I can't find it.

10:07.602 --> 10:10.605
And, uh, I don't know.

10:12.239 --> 10:14.102
What the hell is this?

10:14.122 --> 10:23.175
That's the side of his Arkansas state.

10:25.198 --> 10:33.690
I can't find the darn thing, and that's upsetting me.

10:35.773 --> 10:38.297
I know I didn't give it to you unless it's...

10:39.442 --> 10:41.565
Do you want to take some of that stuff down?

10:41.585 --> 10:49.215
Maybe we'll copy a few more things and we'll look at the movie, and then... Yeah, we've got this, and then I think we're... We'll probably need it.

10:49.235 --> 10:56.024
And Nicole made you copies of this stuff, I think, too.

10:56.044 --> 10:57.286
That'd be fantastic.

10:58.247 --> 10:59.188
All right, let's go.

11:09.412 --> 11:12.076
Nick, what do you think?

11:12.096 --> 11:12.897
What do you think?

11:12.917 --> 11:14.500
Table and screen here?

11:15.541 --> 11:16.462
Is that the best?

11:17.544 --> 11:20.148
We can set the screen up over here and we can use this table.

11:20.308 --> 11:21.109
What do you think?

11:21.169 --> 11:21.690
Okay.

11:22.712 --> 11:23.833
Yeah, that would work, sir.

11:23.853 --> 11:24.735
Either way.

11:24.795 --> 11:26.738
Because the screen's not all that big.

11:26.918 --> 11:28.360
No, it's on the earth.

11:28.440 --> 11:34.950
I mean, yeah.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.814
Whatever you think.

11:37.834 --> 11:38.575
That would be fine.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.770
We just need whatever the projector is.

11:44.910 --> 11:47.253
We need, obviously, somewhere near a PowerPoint.

11:47.434 --> 11:55.804
There's a whole bank of plugs right over there behind that.

11:55.824 --> 11:57.426
That's why I thought over here, yeah.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.107
See on the floor?

11:58.287 --> 12:01.832
Yeah.

12:01.852 --> 12:05.937
It's the concierge.

12:05.957 --> 12:07.459
I think it does.

12:07.499 --> 12:09.121
I haven't used this thing in 20 years.

12:10.443 --> 12:11.464
I'll do it.

12:21.063 --> 12:36.237
You know what I wanted to see is... I think I can get my coffee out of here.

12:56.247 --> 13:01.562
Some water would be nice.

13:01.582 --> 13:02.005
Okay.

13:22.825 --> 13:25.532
on that table and you might need an extension cable.

13:25.552 --> 13:36.140
Do you have a hold on?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.028
Why do these things have to be harder than they are?

14:19.525 --> 14:22.428
Oh, I'm getting frustrated.

14:23.669 --> 14:24.109
That's fine.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.912
Honestly, that's fine.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.494
How do you want to... That's at the right level.

14:28.514 --> 14:30.476
You know, there's a plug over there.

14:30.496 --> 14:32.378
Why don't we just put it on that table?

14:32.758 --> 14:33.759
See that over that table?

14:33.819 --> 14:35.300
On that table, we'll just shoot this way.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.202
How's that?

14:37.222 --> 14:42.147
Perfect.

14:42.167 --> 14:46.051
Now, I am going to make... While you're setting up, it's going to take you a few minutes to set up, right?

14:46.071 --> 14:48.233
I'm going to make one more to row it from the tent.

14:49.394 --> 14:52.839
I'm afraid a couple of letters here.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.782
Don't get frazzled.

14:56.525 --> 15:02.053
I think I might have given you the help.

15:02.073 --> 15:03.875
Have a look through the stuff you've given me.

15:03.996 --> 15:18.557
It's over on the chair.

15:49.705 --> 15:57.370
Pulling spring wire, right there, okay.

16:23.590 --> 16:48.771
Is it too small, the screen?

16:58.741 --> 17:22.829
Remember that trick, not that trick, that rule.

17:24.350 --> 17:27.634
The rule is that as soon as you get something in hand, secure it.

17:27.935 --> 17:29.797
before you move on to the next position.

17:29.817 --> 17:32.100
Does it make sense?

17:32.120 --> 17:32.480
Yeah.

17:32.560 --> 17:40.028
I was just wondering whether your act of securing the docket actually cost you the case, because when someone... It may have.

17:40.048 --> 17:51.781
But I don't think so, because it was... I think what cost me, as I called the day before, to see if there was a day dispersed or more, to see if there was.

17:51.842 --> 17:52.522
I was just guessing.

17:52.702 --> 17:53.423
I didn't know if there was.

17:53.523 --> 17:53.944
I guessed.

17:53.984 --> 17:54.765
This was a guess.

17:55.566 --> 17:56.447
I went to the sale.

17:56.547 --> 17:57.688
I got picked up and removed.

17:58.411 --> 18:03.118
Then I hear Bob Nightcourt telling me that they think it was a case up in their neck of the woods.

18:03.439 --> 18:04.320
He lives in Cambridge.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.782
I went to the courthouse there.

18:05.802 --> 18:06.784
I called him to the house.

18:06.804 --> 18:08.627
I said, yeah, we got one.

18:08.787 --> 18:09.608
I said, oh, great.

18:09.628 --> 18:11.030
I'll be in there tomorrow.

18:12.012 --> 18:12.993
I got to ask him.

18:13.013 --> 18:13.134
Great.

18:13.154 --> 18:14.115
That's what I think it was.

18:14.175 --> 18:15.778
That might be it.

18:15.978 --> 18:18.161
Certainly, that was too soon to impound the stuff.

18:18.181 --> 18:18.682
You got to go.

18:19.443 --> 18:25.312
But it certainly wasn't too late to get the stuff and to pull it into the judges' chambers.

18:25.513 --> 18:25.853
You know?

18:35.367 --> 18:39.174
Yeah, you know, I don't know.

18:39.294 --> 18:42.560
Have I looked through the stuff you've already run off for me?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.862
No, I'm going to do that last.

18:44.383 --> 18:45.164
I'm really trying.

18:47.007 --> 18:48.550
I mean, I handled everything.

18:48.630 --> 18:51.315
I might have been flying through stuff here.

18:52.417 --> 18:59.890
I might have just threw that in a pile and having meant to copy it.

19:01.338 --> 19:02.720
Yeah, this is very interesting.

19:03.161 --> 19:04.322
Oh, yeah, this is good.

19:04.422 --> 19:08.868
This is an article that was on the Boston Globe.

19:08.909 --> 19:09.489
Here's another case.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.212
Here's a case with Guthiel.

19:12.353 --> 19:19.063
Guthiel was a case where it was in Boston Globe.

19:19.083 --> 19:27.535
It had nothing to do with our men, but it showed the kind of stuff that he does.

19:27.635 --> 19:29.337
A professional witness in cases like this.

19:30.751 --> 19:37.433
He doesn't want to testify here.

19:37.453 --> 19:39.218
I believe he was the treating.

19:40.201 --> 19:43.191
I believe that he treated, examined,

20:03.100 --> 20:07.900
Her father had a stroke a couple months ago.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.676
She's been spending quite a bit of time now.

20:39.432 --> 20:42.656
This is the letter, you've got to have this letter.

21:03.599 --> 21:04.039
This is one of them.

21:11.208 --> 21:33.483
The letter was handed back out of the hand in general.

21:33.503 --> 21:33.683
Is there?

21:33.703 --> 21:34.024
No, do you know?

21:34.044 --> 21:34.144
Yeah.

21:34.164 --> 21:34.465
Any way to see?

21:34.485 --> 21:35.306
They agree with me, they're sort of fine.

21:35.326 --> 21:35.967
Well, they were trying to do it.

21:40.688 --> 22:03.068
That's why you answered that question.

22:06.136 --> 22:13.807
Let me just find one more letter number.

22:13.887 --> 22:15.032
That's one I was looking for.

23:33.650 --> 23:48.044
Okay, if that other one was the Rosetta Stone, this was the light bulb that flashes over the country's character's head.

23:48.064 --> 23:49.905
And it's usually the most trivial thing.

23:49.925 --> 23:53.449
You never know what it's going to be, all right?

23:53.609 --> 23:58.554
You go through the registry of the agent, and then you come across it, and bring it to a sign Parkinson's.

23:58.574 --> 24:00.496
Oh, there it is.

24:00.516 --> 24:02.037
The other sign, David O'Moore.

24:02.641 --> 24:06.106
hereby agree that the guy's limited in New York, uh, what?

24:06.947 --> 24:13.836
A New York limited partnership of which Avon O'Moore, Avon O'Moore, took a general partner with a postdoc that's addressed.

24:17.000 --> 24:17.160
Yeah?

24:17.300 --> 24:19.363
Well, how am I supposed to know?

24:19.403 --> 24:20.845
The traditional science is here.

24:20.865 --> 24:21.506
The folks are here.

24:21.526 --> 24:22.307
He's here.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.989
How do I know he went to military?

24:24.009 --> 24:25.672
You know why he went there?

24:25.692 --> 24:27.935
Because this other guy is scooch.

24:27.955 --> 24:29.837
He's also crazy.

24:29.977 --> 24:30.538
He runs amateur.

24:31.143 --> 24:37.891
He allowed him to use his business address as a male problem.

24:38.832 --> 24:44.638
He allowed him to use his address to set up a limited partnership and bury the paperwork out of New York State.

24:44.658 --> 24:47.702
That's just coming out of New York City.

24:47.802 --> 24:49.584
We do this in New York City.

24:49.604 --> 24:50.986
These ads are going to be running a New York City paper.

24:51.006 --> 24:51.626
Move upstate.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.249
We don't even see it.

24:54.269 --> 24:55.951
Very, very, very.

24:55.971 --> 24:59.175
It's a parking space, but that sends me to New York.

25:00.472 --> 25:16.523
where I get the limit of time to shape.

25:16.543 --> 25:18.327
You can see there are even 10 critical documents here to represent this is a paper chase.

25:18.347 --> 25:18.627
A paper trail.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.571
So even though I'll use that pounded space, you still can't control .

25:20.591 --> 25:21.012
A wonderful big study

25:21.143 --> 25:27.436
Now you have to have these before you go in.

25:27.696 --> 25:32.346
I'm going to have a glass of wine.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.833
Would you also have a glass of wine?

25:35.933 --> 25:42.747
Thank you.

25:52.683 --> 25:56.952
Yes, I would.

26:00.078 --> 26:04.387
How it matters by you, Nicole.

26:04.407 --> 26:10.860
She is, by the way, extraordinary.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.080
Six leads.

26:13.658 --> 26:29.826
She said, well, she wasn't being actress.

26:29.846 --> 26:31.609
She said, well, in the future of the public schools, she said, oh, here's my conception.

26:31.629 --> 26:32.691
It's our submission to consider this as a profession.

26:32.711 --> 26:33.052
She told me this.

26:33.072 --> 26:33.413
She told me this.

26:33.433 --> 26:33.773
She told me this.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.134
She told me this.

26:34.154 --> 26:34.495
She told me this.

26:34.515 --> 26:34.855
She told me this.

26:34.875 --> 26:35.216
She told me this.

26:35.236 --> 26:35.576
She told me this.

26:35.596 --> 26:35.937
She told me this.

27:04.098 --> 27:06.423
Where does the sound come out of me?

27:06.544 --> 27:10.232
I'm going to just do a voice tape over.

27:10.753 --> 27:16.707
Are you ready by the way?

27:39.417 --> 27:42.500
Did you talk to her, Nick?

27:42.521 --> 27:43.321
Did you talk to her?

27:45.143 --> 27:45.224
Yes.

27:45.244 --> 27:46.385
Well, I... Or was it just a message?

27:47.606 --> 27:52.672
Oh, that's... Okay.

27:52.692 --> 27:52.792
Yeah.

27:52.812 --> 27:53.113
There it is.

27:53.133 --> 27:55.996
Machines make that noise, isn't it?

27:56.016 --> 27:57.417
No, that's okay.

27:57.518 --> 27:58.479
It's a project.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.082
Nicole, you want to see Haven or more?

28:02.603 --> 28:03.284
Or the yogi.

28:03.304 --> 28:04.045
The yogi, yeah.

28:04.065 --> 28:05.186
That's what you'll see him doing.

28:05.827 --> 28:06.808
Fine, just get this.

28:07.244 --> 28:09.587
Oh, this is at your elbow store.

28:09.827 --> 28:10.568
Thank you very much.

28:10.909 --> 28:11.269
Cheers.

28:11.710 --> 28:12.070
Thank you.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.452
Did we have a productive day?

28:13.532 --> 28:13.953
Thank you.

28:14.313 --> 28:15.575
Well, yes, I did.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.625
We may be a minute or two away from this because this has got crust in the luggage.

28:24.105 --> 28:25.307
Oh, shit.

28:26.549 --> 28:28.171
It's catching the film as it comes around.

28:30.734 --> 28:31.895
Where did you bring this from?

28:31.935 --> 28:34.118
From the projector?

28:34.138 --> 28:35.580
From California.

28:36.539 --> 28:37.800
Kidding, why didn't you get one here?

28:37.941 --> 28:43.367
Because I didn't want to spend two days looking for one on a three-day trip, and I was lucky because I haven't had a spare moment.

28:43.487 --> 28:47.371
You know, I've been out here, I've been with Casper, I've been going to earn more of himself.

28:50.535 --> 28:52.957
What do they charge you to rent one of these things?

28:52.977 --> 28:55.480
For the week, 100 bucks.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.582
That's a pretty good profit, isn't it?

28:57.602 --> 28:59.104
Yeah, we're not doing bad, are we?

29:13.478 --> 29:36.546
Yeah, I don't have it.

29:36.606 --> 29:38.268
I thought I might have a take-up reel.

29:38.449 --> 29:40.431
Have you got a take-up reel?

29:42.335 --> 29:43.997
But it's not that big.

29:45.559 --> 29:49.203
I've got a 35mm film that I made when I was in the Navy 30 years ago.

29:49.264 --> 29:52.588
I think we've got to play it now.

29:55.892 --> 29:58.755
It's not going to work.

29:58.775 --> 30:00.778
Well, that's a kick in the ass, isn't it?

30:00.798 --> 30:08.427
No, this car will be...

30:12.524 --> 30:13.606
Well, you got one look out of it.

30:13.986 --> 30:14.547
Oh, rats.

30:14.707 --> 30:16.550
You're no idea.

30:16.570 --> 30:16.691
Huh?

30:16.731 --> 30:21.378
Well, that's the bore.

30:21.398 --> 30:22.560
It worked last night though, right?

30:22.740 --> 30:22.980
Yeah.

30:23.601 --> 30:24.202
Easy peasy.

30:24.283 --> 30:27.007
But it wasn't this spool that we used.

30:27.027 --> 30:27.708
That was the pump.

30:29.711 --> 30:31.033
Oh, you plated it in his place?

30:31.053 --> 30:31.714
Yeah.

30:31.734 --> 30:36.642
This is the spare spool that they supplied that's got screwed up in transit.

30:52.197 --> 30:53.458
I don't have a take-up reel.

30:53.478 --> 30:54.019
Do you not?

30:55.701 --> 30:59.045
I might have one, but it's just half the size, so it's not going to help.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.327
I mean, the film would run over.

31:01.367 --> 31:07.514
The color looks pretty good after 30 years.

31:07.534 --> 31:08.515
The color is very good.

31:08.536 --> 31:09.477
This is a very good print.

31:09.557 --> 31:11.979
I don't want to teach you too much.

31:14.202 --> 31:16.184
But this is actually a very good print.

31:20.089 --> 31:20.449
Very...

31:21.914 --> 31:22.595
well-kept.

31:22.615 --> 31:25.137
He's kept it in pristine condition.

31:25.157 --> 31:26.038
Pristine neck.

31:26.239 --> 31:31.824
Well, we should give it one more shot, and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

31:31.845 --> 31:33.686
I just want to get the film off this floor first.

31:34.147 --> 31:36.089
But you're going to promise me a videotape.

31:36.269 --> 31:36.730
Oh, yeah.

31:36.770 --> 31:46.480
Well, that's a given.

31:48.122 --> 31:48.422
That's a given.

31:48.442 --> 31:49.503
I can't rewind it because I didn't come off one clue.

31:49.523 --> 31:49.924
I can't really hook.

31:49.944 --> 31:50.284
You see that?

31:52.677 --> 31:53.258
I don't understand.

31:53.278 --> 31:56.400
Why is it not taking it up?

31:57.221 --> 32:02.126
It's because the spool has been... It's been compressed.

32:02.206 --> 32:15.377
I carried this as hand luggage to make sure it was okay, but the spool went in the hold and the spool has been pressed so that it's catching the film when it comes to the wind.

32:15.398 --> 32:16.879
Okay.

32:16.899 --> 32:18.620
Well, you certainly don't want to damage the film.

32:20.082 --> 32:21.503
Take the film off it.

32:21.837 --> 32:29.506
And that could happen, you know, even if you do get the thing to run.

32:29.526 --> 32:36.854
I ain't gonna run through that, is it?

32:36.874 --> 32:37.534
What's a bore?

32:43.121 --> 32:44.602
No, the spool is not good.

32:44.622 --> 32:46.264
I don't want to risk the scratch.

32:46.284 --> 32:46.805
No, no, it's fine.

32:46.825 --> 32:47.025
It's fine.

32:47.045 --> 32:48.967
Let's finish our wine, and we'll go back to Cambridge.

32:49.628 --> 32:49.928
Nicky?

32:50.529 --> 32:50.629
Yeah?

32:52.060 --> 32:54.402
One copy each of these.

32:54.422 --> 32:55.003
That's not much.

32:58.566 --> 32:58.926
All right.

32:59.166 --> 33:03.250
I make very, very good copies.

33:04.911 --> 33:05.331
All right.

33:05.492 --> 33:05.932
One of each.

33:10.456 --> 33:10.776
One of each.

33:10.796 --> 33:11.657
You saw the title.

33:12.438 --> 33:13.178
I saw the title.

33:13.198 --> 33:18.483
Yeah, I'm really kind of eager.

33:18.503 --> 33:21.105
So how much are you going to have it on tape for 70 minutes?

33:21.541 --> 33:22.663
Are you going to dupe it?

33:23.183 --> 33:23.364
Oh, yeah.

33:23.384 --> 33:25.787
Are you going to let me listen to it at some point?

33:25.968 --> 33:26.128
Yeah.

33:26.148 --> 33:27.550
Do you want to have him listen to it now?

33:28.271 --> 33:29.192
I can't listen to it.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.555
I mean, we don't have the whole thing.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.058
No, but I've got your phones.

33:33.078 --> 33:33.539
Yeah.

33:33.639 --> 33:34.180
You can listen to it.

33:35.202 --> 33:36.604
I'd love to hear his voice.

33:40.109 --> 33:47.881
I'm not asking you for a copy of that tape, but if you decide to give anybody else a copy, then I'd like to request the privilege of having one as well.

33:47.901 --> 33:48.882
You'd be first.

33:51.258 --> 34:07.246
I mean, I know, uh, I can't be saying I'd give you a copy of any of my tapes, so, you know, but, uh, but, um, but I certainly wouldn't be, uh... This is quite a nice little... It's a little little gizmo.

34:07.447 --> 34:09.350
Is it, uh, sprung?

34:09.991 --> 34:15.561
Yeah, you'll hear the, uh...

34:16.098 --> 34:16.979
What do these cost now?

34:16.999 --> 34:20.164
When I priced these the last time, they were like $1,700 or something.

34:20.184 --> 34:21.525
Yeah, it's down to about $1,000.

34:21.626 --> 34:29.697
It is?

34:30.278 --> 34:32.340
Okay.

34:40.051 --> 34:40.672
Which one, Neil?

34:40.712 --> 34:41.213
The black one?

34:41.493 --> 34:45.919
It's the line-out.

34:46.422 --> 34:55.891
We don't have to listen to the whole thing.

34:55.911 --> 34:57.733
I'm really eager to hear his voice.

35:00.055 --> 35:03.278
Is there any good stuff, sort of bullshit at the front?

35:03.658 --> 35:07.822
Yeah, just sort of, you know, time and day bullshit at the front.

35:07.842 --> 35:11.545
And then after that, we get into his father.

35:12.887 --> 35:15.349
What does he say about his father?

35:15.785 --> 35:18.328
And then... Does he hate his father?

35:19.209 --> 35:22.413
No, he was very... He says his father saved his life.

35:23.053 --> 35:24.996
Why did he run away from home?

35:25.016 --> 35:29.060
Because of the time he was unhappy, but what he realized was the discipline.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.522
It was useful to him later in life.

35:30.542 --> 35:33.586
Did he talk about his father cutting him out of a will?

35:35.148 --> 35:37.330
No, because I didn't ask.

35:37.410 --> 35:38.131
Yours is on the right.

35:38.151 --> 35:38.852
Yeah.

35:38.872 --> 35:39.292
Okay, you in?

35:39.573 --> 35:40.854
These go like this.

35:41.435 --> 35:43.097
Yeah.

35:43.117 --> 35:44.138
How do you make them stay in?

35:45.198 --> 35:53.646
Take a minute.

35:54.567 --> 35:57.529
Okay, go ahead.

35:57.549 --> 35:57.770
You got it?

35:57.790 --> 35:57.870
Yep.

35:57.890 --> 35:58.030
You up?

35:58.050 --> 36:12.023
Boy, that's great.

36:12.043 --> 36:13.264
Boy, the voice is something, isn't it?

36:19.370 --> 36:27.801
Very small voice, isn't he?

36:28.081 --> 36:29.282
Can I increase the volume on this?

36:30.043 --> 36:32.186
I think it's quite low because the battery's dead.

36:32.206 --> 36:33.007
These are the last ones.

36:34.849 --> 36:35.951
Okay, I'm fine.

36:43.981 --> 36:45.483
What book are you talking about here at the front?

36:47.345 --> 36:48.466
The beautiful book.

36:48.487 --> 36:48.887
The Aesop.

36:49.795 --> 36:53.781
Aesop published in Cambridge in the 30s, illustrated by Stephen Goodman.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.945
I repeat a couple of things because he's deaf.

36:59.329 --> 37:02.593
Oh, Nicole, I'm sorry about the letdown of the movie.

37:02.613 --> 37:03.114
Oh, that's all right.

37:03.134 --> 37:03.895
Can I go through that?

37:06.118 --> 37:07.400
I'm sorry.

37:07.981 --> 37:09.283
I'm sorry.

37:09.303 --> 37:10.444
Your story?

37:10.464 --> 37:12.187
What are you going for?

37:12.207 --> 37:15.071
The most beautiful book of the 20th century is one I just published.

37:18.396 --> 37:19.397
I don't know.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.049
And I did give you a copy of this.

37:38.610 --> 37:45.140
Yeah.

37:45.160 --> 37:48.125
Well, you have everything, I think, that's really important here.

37:55.335 --> 37:56.918
Do you have some sticky tape?

37:56.938 --> 37:57.118
Tape?

37:57.138 --> 37:59.001
Yeah, just to keep it in.

38:00.143 --> 38:01.124
Do you know the tape?

38:01.144 --> 38:03.347
No, no, go get the tape I use for the boxes.

38:04.189 --> 38:04.369
Oh, okay.

38:04.906 --> 38:05.487
Where is it?

38:05.547 --> 38:06.448
In the garage?

38:06.468 --> 38:06.749
No, no.

38:06.769 --> 38:07.630
Look out on the porch.

38:22.531 --> 38:23.352
He's very smooth.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.202
I can see how sedentary he is.

38:30.923 --> 38:33.867
Here you go.

38:34.893 --> 38:36.535
Thank you very much.

38:36.655 --> 38:37.476
You pull it.

38:37.496 --> 38:38.637
Be careful with it.

38:38.898 --> 38:39.839
I'll show you.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.100
Does it kill?

38:41.601 --> 38:42.622
It's a stitch.

38:42.642 --> 38:45.025
Yeah, you have to pull it hard.

38:46.326 --> 38:49.049
But you don't want, no, no, don't let it go.

38:49.069 --> 38:51.011
It will go on the roll.

38:52.473 --> 38:53.975
And you can't find it.

38:54.656 --> 38:55.096
There's one.

38:55.377 --> 38:56.698
You need another one?

39:00.391 --> 39:01.292
Do you want a zero, sis?

39:01.312 --> 39:05.336
Yeah, Nicole, now this is a request, and I want you to be very careful.

39:05.536 --> 39:05.796
Very careful.

39:05.816 --> 39:08.679
You don't break the glass on the copying machine.

39:08.699 --> 39:09.941
Oh, jeez.

39:09.961 --> 39:10.061
Okay.

39:10.721 --> 39:11.542
Do you want just the lid?

39:11.562 --> 39:12.343
Copy that?

39:12.944 --> 39:18.689
I want you to just put this on the top, and I want a couple copies.

39:18.709 --> 39:18.810
What?

39:18.830 --> 39:20.752
Just place it, I want the label.

39:21.753 --> 39:21.853
Okay.

39:22.854 --> 39:23.214
Thank you.

39:23.234 --> 39:24.335
And do a couple of copies.

39:24.355 --> 39:26.497
Do it until you get a good one that looks good.

39:27.018 --> 39:28.319
All right, all right, all right, all right.

39:28.339 --> 39:29.200
Isn't she a good kid?

39:43.709 --> 39:45.291
Does his voice sound like this in the movie?

39:45.931 --> 39:46.392
Same voice?

39:46.412 --> 39:49.455
His voice is very strong, but less of a twang, less of a southern twang.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.157
He has a southern twang here.

39:51.337 --> 39:51.677
Yeah, yeah.

39:52.118 --> 39:53.519
He has a southern twang here, you think?

39:53.660 --> 39:54.941
Yeah, yeah, there's more in there.

39:54.961 --> 40:09.016
Yeah, you get a little bit of Arkansas, just in a couple of vowel sounds.

40:09.036 --> 40:12.940
The lawyer in Kansas who deposed him

40:14.219 --> 40:28.037
He said the guy was the most egregious sociopath he'd ever seen in his life, on the strength of his testimony, I understand.

40:36.107 --> 40:37.969
Was the companion there when he came to see you?

40:39.251 --> 40:39.511
No.

40:39.591 --> 40:40.292
How was he dressed?

40:41.354 --> 40:44.057
I thought he was going to be well dressed, and I thought on suit and tie and everything.

40:44.594 --> 41:01.434
He was wearing just sweatpants and a shell suit attraction.

41:01.454 --> 41:02.215
What was that?

41:02.235 --> 41:02.856
What did he sell?

41:02.876 --> 41:04.417
Very low at $5,000 each?

41:04.778 --> 41:05.559
What's he talking about?

41:05.579 --> 41:07.881
The limited edition sacrificial bone inscriptions.

41:07.901 --> 41:08.322
Too low?

41:09.223 --> 41:11.766
He sold it to Jim Casper for $6,000.

41:13.433 --> 41:14.594
This guy is crazy, you know.

41:14.935 --> 41:16.156
This is insane.

41:16.196 --> 41:17.658
Do you understand this?

41:17.678 --> 41:21.742
$5,000 for that piece of madness, which is what it is?

41:23.424 --> 41:25.386
Have you read the sacrificial bone inscriptions?

41:25.426 --> 41:41.143
Make my ears bleed.

41:41.163 --> 41:42.124
All right.

41:42.728 --> 41:47.594
I'm so sorry you can't see it.

41:47.974 --> 41:50.417
I know, but you'll just have to, it'll only be a week more.

41:50.477 --> 41:51.098
Well, ten days more.

41:51.118 --> 41:52.740
That's fine.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.964
Ten days more you'll have.

41:55.984 --> 41:57.465
Do you want crappies in this?

41:58.547 --> 42:00.489
No, I can take that one.

42:00.509 --> 42:01.630
This is coming home with me.

42:01.650 --> 42:05.875
Taking this to London.

42:05.895 --> 42:06.757
There's a man on tape.

42:07.638 --> 42:11.402
Well, I'm going to do it.

42:13.053 --> 42:14.034
So is your mother okay?

42:14.054 --> 42:15.737
I heard about her troubles with her.

42:15.757 --> 42:20.484
My mother, um, she's just visiting my father, my grandfather.

42:21.105 --> 42:21.325
Yeah.

42:22.347 --> 42:22.447
Yeah.

42:22.467 --> 42:23.148
So, drag.

42:25.972 --> 42:26.533
But... Is he okay?

42:26.553 --> 42:27.114
Is he recovering?

42:27.875 --> 42:28.977
Uh, he... Doubtful.

42:30.018 --> 42:30.179
Mm.

42:31.901 --> 42:35.647
He's been sick for about four months, so... He's very severe.

42:35.767 --> 42:37.229
He's partially paralyzed.

42:38.271 --> 42:39.212
He can't swallow.

42:39.547 --> 42:43.151
He's got the cognitive ability, perhaps, of a three-year-old.

42:43.391 --> 42:45.233
I don't know.

42:49.218 --> 42:51.180
I'm amazed at how she handles it.

42:52.742 --> 42:54.304
The finest printer who's ever lived?

42:54.704 --> 43:01.231
I can't show him the movie.

43:01.251 --> 43:05.696
At least I can do his voice.

43:05.716 --> 43:08.119
It's yoga.

43:08.437 --> 43:14.787
I mean, he's quite an advanced yoga.

43:14.807 --> 43:15.909
I love yoga.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.033
He and my sister got me into it.

43:19.053 --> 43:19.294
Yeah.

43:19.955 --> 43:20.375
Yeah.

43:20.436 --> 43:23.480
I'll get you a copy.

43:23.500 --> 43:28.328
You don't have it for one reason, but for now.

43:28.348 --> 43:29.369
Ah, good.

43:29.530 --> 43:30.892
Did you call him doctor or more?

43:31.953 --> 43:32.454
Yeah, all the time.

43:32.514 --> 43:33.516
Did he correct you?

43:33.536 --> 43:34.718
No.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.300
At the end, he insisted I call him Hayden.

43:36.601 --> 43:41.546
Because by then he decided I was a rascal and felt he'd been played a little.

43:44.809 --> 43:46.410
By the way, Steph, there's the southern accent.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.332
A hundred thousand dollars a piece?

43:50.414 --> 43:54.838
He's out of his fucking mind.

43:54.858 --> 43:56.299
This guy is crazy.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.200
Do you understand this?

43:57.460 --> 44:01.865
A hundred thousand dollars for sacrificial bone inscriptions.

44:03.486 --> 44:04.387
A vanity book.

44:04.407 --> 44:05.528
You know what a vanity book is?

44:08.022 --> 44:17.959
They're all learning about it.

44:17.979 --> 44:26.253
This whole soliloquy here was set in motion by your saying you saw a beautiful book.

44:28.117 --> 44:29.279
Do you understand this is the same?

44:29.319 --> 44:30.461
It's not enough.

44:30.701 --> 44:31.903
When you read the deposition

44:33.352 --> 44:35.074
The garden is not enough.

44:35.215 --> 44:38.199
He has to have not one Gutenberg Bible.

44:38.559 --> 44:39.320
He has to have two.

44:40.422 --> 44:44.147
And now you've seen a book that Colin says is the most beautiful book of the 20th century.

44:44.427 --> 44:45.949
No, mine is.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.531
That's, you know?

44:48.933 --> 44:56.203
I mean, yeah, I used it just as an opening gambit, but he gave great perspective feedback.

45:03.423 --> 45:04.344
Do you want to be an actress?

45:06.026 --> 45:06.667
I don't know.

45:06.727 --> 45:11.752
Well, it's the only thing it can do very well, but... That's not a good read.

45:11.772 --> 45:12.993
Oh, I don't know.

45:13.013 --> 45:17.819
I love it, but... He's talking about Cobden Sanderson and private press books.

45:17.839 --> 45:19.480
Cobden Sanderson was a binder, wasn't he?

45:19.540 --> 45:20.942
Cobden Sanderson wasn't a printer.

45:20.962 --> 45:22.664
He also says Kem Scott.

45:22.864 --> 45:23.725
That's a mistake.

45:23.745 --> 45:26.007
Yeah, he also says... That's a mistake.

45:26.128 --> 45:27.009
He says Kem Scott.

45:27.029 --> 45:28.350
This man who knows so much...

45:29.326 --> 45:30.407
That's a major mistake.

45:30.427 --> 45:32.069
Cobden-Sanderson is a binder.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.653
He says Kemscott for Kelmscott.

45:34.673 --> 45:39.539
He says Adenheimer's disease for Alzheimer's disease.

45:40.260 --> 45:42.442
He says perspicuity for perspicacity.

45:42.482 --> 45:44.785
There are multiple prisons all the way through.

45:44.805 --> 45:46.407
Maybe he had a little stroke.

45:46.487 --> 45:52.875
I'll cut slack on words that are mispronounced.

45:52.895 --> 45:55.238
But this shows ignorance of what he's talking about.

45:55.258 --> 45:56.880
So does Kemscott.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.063
Kemscott is egregious.

45:59.532 --> 46:02.196
But to suggest, that's just a mispronunciation.

46:02.556 --> 46:07.704
But to say Cobden Sanderson is the great printer of the 20th century when Cobden Sanderson is a binder.

46:07.804 --> 46:11.389
You sure he wasn't talking about Brockman?

46:11.529 --> 46:11.990
I can't remember.

46:12.030 --> 46:14.173
He's talking about the sanest person.

46:14.213 --> 46:15.295
Colin thinks he's crazy.

46:15.335 --> 46:16.076
I think he's sane.

46:16.196 --> 46:17.799
I think he's the greatest printer of the 20th.

46:17.919 --> 46:18.880
Oh, okay.

46:18.900 --> 46:19.741
Maybe I misheard.

46:20.963 --> 46:21.945
I haven't transcribed it yet.

46:22.165 --> 46:22.786
I can't wait.

46:22.946 --> 46:23.667
It was yesterday.

46:27.460 --> 46:33.448
Hearing his voice for me is really, it's not even the content, it's hearing it.

46:33.628 --> 46:46.386
I mean, this is a guy I spent five years pursuing, like the fugitive, you know, like the one-armed man trying to find a son of a bitch hiding under a fucking rock, excuse me.

46:46.406 --> 46:48.409
I'm sorry, honey.

46:48.429 --> 46:48.829
No, it's all right.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.371
She knows your father.

46:50.391 --> 46:51.713
I'm an old naval officer.

46:51.862 --> 46:54.625
He's worth without, you know, people around.

46:58.848 --> 47:01.311
Let me just write that down.

47:01.331 --> 47:03.132
Worth solo.

47:04.013 --> 47:05.254
Got it.

47:05.274 --> 47:07.576
That's a good book, you know, that's all of his marginalia.

47:07.877 --> 47:10.619
All of his annotations, I beg your pardon.

47:11.019 --> 47:15.504
More than the marginalia, the annotations to every book they can find.

47:15.544 --> 47:20.468
Well, let's have one more glass of wine.

47:21.359 --> 47:24.444
Do you mind if young Nicole rides with us to Cambridge?

47:25.345 --> 47:28.189
Okay, great.

47:29.311 --> 47:30.713
I'll be fine, I promise.

47:30.853 --> 47:32.535
You're the caperite.

47:32.555 --> 47:32.876
Say what?

47:33.216 --> 47:34.338
You're the caperite.

47:34.358 --> 47:34.618
Yay!

47:36.822 --> 47:40.086
Oh, the hell of you, I won't fool real.

47:40.106 --> 47:43.551
Isn't it funny when somebody else is like, there's something in you guys.

47:45.915 --> 47:47.417
He read in the afterword.

48:01.724 --> 48:09.015
You'll see, I just, you know, every so often just a little word and just let him in spaceship.

48:09.035 --> 48:15.485
As long as you've got an open-ended thing, because at some point you've got to get him on that track.

48:15.505 --> 48:20.693
But if the first thing I say is, did you drug Michael Davis, then, you know, I ain't going to get questions.

48:20.713 --> 48:24.579
No, you've got to get stuff here that you can, but this is a, see, you're smart.

48:24.719 --> 48:28.044
The beauty of this, this is broadcast quality.

48:28.285 --> 48:28.525
Yeah.

48:30.547 --> 48:31.848
And he knew you were taping him.

48:31.868 --> 48:32.169
Yeah.

48:32.189 --> 48:33.250
And he had no problems with that.

48:33.470 --> 48:33.931
Yeah.

48:33.951 --> 48:37.254
I've given him my word that it's for research purposes.

48:37.274 --> 48:47.245
But... I'm just so pissed off with his sport.

48:50.948 --> 48:54.252
So, I mean, maybe you don't know whether you want to do it or not.

48:54.332 --> 48:55.373
I really do.

48:56.095 --> 48:58.057
So why are you so apologetic about it?

48:58.077 --> 48:58.637
I don't know.

48:58.697 --> 49:02.881
I could be a doctor or a lawyer.

49:03.041 --> 49:14.851
Probably not, but... Acting... I love acting, but... I don't know, I mean... Not much job security.

49:14.871 --> 49:17.153
You have to like a license and you have to have a thick skin.

49:17.554 --> 49:21.297
I mean, the reasons most people become actors are the same reason most people don't.

49:22.218 --> 49:24.600
It's too hard to make it, though, you know, I mean...

49:25.390 --> 49:28.713
Maybe I could be like a film historian or something, I could do that.

49:29.854 --> 49:32.517
Or a film critic, like my dad.

49:32.977 --> 49:33.678
Sort of, he did.

49:37.261 --> 49:43.907
I don't know, I'm dedicated to the arts and I have to contribute somehow, you know, as an adult.

49:45.088 --> 49:45.348
Yeah.

49:45.689 --> 49:46.129
Good luck.

49:46.870 --> 49:50.273
Whatever for you.

49:50.293 --> 49:50.493
Thank you.

49:50.513 --> 49:53.676
But deep down I love acting, I really do.

49:54.517 --> 49:57.501
She did a play a couple months ago and she was sick.

49:58.822 --> 50:00.084
Oh, yeah, much worse.

50:00.164 --> 50:09.836
And she had one of the leads, and so she actually worked her sickness into the... She did it three times, and I swear it was different.

50:10.898 --> 50:15.524
And when the cold got worse, she started playing, but she used it to the moment.

50:15.644 --> 50:20.410
I mean, it was... I thought it was supposed to be like that, you know?

50:20.430 --> 50:22.453
That's the way it is.

50:22.473 --> 50:22.853
I had a serious...

50:23.558 --> 50:42.549
in the UK TV series that we recorded, it was set in a TV newsroom, and it was recorded the night before it went out, so all the news we put in at the last minute, we had sort of 20 minutes of it, you know, 25 minutes of it, the last five minutes went in at the last minute because it's all the news to go in.

50:42.569 --> 50:46.495
And we recorded on a Wednesday, it went out on a Thursday, on a Tuesday,

50:47.234 --> 50:50.577
stupid accident in the rehearsal room.

50:50.597 --> 50:52.299
I got smacked in the mouth.

50:52.319 --> 50:52.960
Oh no.

50:53.260 --> 50:57.124
That baseball bat thing came off and I got a little scar there.

50:57.625 --> 50:59.466
My lip was out here.

50:59.707 --> 51:09.917
I got mugged by school kids on the way to work because I had a huge fat lip in certain stitches by the sort of cap that I had been choking out of it.

51:09.937 --> 51:16.364
It was my least attractive moment in front of me.

51:16.384 --> 51:16.684
Oh gosh.

51:17.238 --> 51:19.721
It's all cool technique.

51:19.741 --> 51:20.362
Yeah, I guess.

51:22.065 --> 51:24.007
I guess.

51:24.027 --> 51:24.548
So where are you at?

51:24.568 --> 51:26.010
Is this school productions?

51:26.150 --> 51:26.751
Yeah.

51:26.771 --> 51:29.054
I'm not sure if Dramatics is fine.

51:29.074 --> 51:29.314
No.

51:29.334 --> 51:30.176
High school.

51:30.196 --> 51:30.877
What quarrel?

51:31.678 --> 51:33.760
You said was some quarrel decided in your favor?

51:35.142 --> 51:39.208
Oh, this is the Chicago University claiming that the Harvey is theirs.

51:39.228 --> 51:40.590
It is?

51:40.610 --> 51:40.710
Yeah.

51:40.730 --> 51:42.052
That's why he's going to give it back.

51:42.332 --> 51:43.594
He's lying to you again.

51:43.614 --> 51:46.738
I knew this, but... Do you want me to say at that point...

51:46.904 --> 51:55.697
You're lying because I know that actually they put in a claim and that it came from here, because... And he's saying he's going to donate it in the name of... Exactly.

51:55.717 --> 52:01.485
I'll tell you what the final... But do you know what the final resolution of this thing was?

52:01.545 --> 52:05.511
They agreed that he brought it in good faith.

52:07.934 --> 52:09.857
He can keep it as long as he lives, I guess.

52:10.298 --> 52:11.159
And then they get it back.

52:11.500 --> 52:15.305
For him to say now he's going to present it in Maria's name, it's bullshit.

52:15.485 --> 52:15.966
I knew that.

52:16.334 --> 52:18.198
And I sat there and I smiled sweetly.

52:18.278 --> 52:19.280
But he's lying to you.

52:19.300 --> 52:19.841
Do you understand?

52:19.901 --> 52:20.443
I know that.

52:21.284 --> 52:21.785
I know that.

52:22.367 --> 52:23.749
I'm telling you he is a liar.

52:23.769 --> 52:25.072
You don't need to.

52:25.754 --> 52:26.736
He carried on talking.

52:27.818 --> 52:28.760
I've done my research.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.982
I did my homework.

52:30.002 --> 52:32.548
Never ask a question to which you do not know the answer.

52:32.608 --> 52:32.989
I know that.

52:33.049 --> 52:36.115
It's good that I listen to this, by the way, because...

52:36.533 --> 52:37.494
I just let him talk.

52:37.554 --> 52:38.795
I didn't know that you understood that.

52:38.815 --> 52:39.996
I said, wait a minute, the Harvey thing?

52:40.097 --> 52:48.545
What I wanted him to feel is that he was going to get an opportunity to present the version of Haven O'Moore that he wanted to present.

52:49.346 --> 52:57.514
And if I start cross-examining him as some sort of grand inquisitor or meeting one, that ain't going to happen.

52:57.534 --> 52:57.774
Wait, wait.

52:57.794 --> 52:58.735
Let's stop.

52:58.755 --> 53:00.997
Eleanor, I came out of my mother's womb.

53:01.518 --> 53:02.058
Oh, this is good.

53:02.138 --> 53:04.701
With a desire to know about

53:05.660 --> 53:09.984
That's a great quote.

53:10.445 --> 53:15.109
I would use that quote as an epigraph to my chapter.

53:16.851 --> 53:23.197
Transcribe that for me and send it to me.

53:23.217 --> 53:24.018
I would just like it.

53:25.679 --> 53:27.561
It doesn't have to be on tape.

53:29.022 --> 53:33.827
When you transcribe that, it's at 1730.

53:34.060 --> 53:40.990
That's fantastic.

53:41.852 --> 53:42.372
And you know what?

53:42.853 --> 53:43.494
That I believe.

53:44.636 --> 53:45.257
That I believe.

53:45.317 --> 53:47.600
That's true.

53:47.841 --> 53:50.104
That is the greatness of this story.

53:51.206 --> 53:52.988
That is true of Haven Amour.

53:53.329 --> 53:57.755
That is the gentle and not so gentle madness.

53:57.775 --> 53:58.977
I have to hear that fucker again.

53:59.037 --> 53:59.518
Excuse me.

54:01.301 --> 54:03.544
You know, the way to his heart

54:04.773 --> 54:05.614
I apologize.

54:05.634 --> 54:08.317
Am I a little too rough around and raw around our edges here?

54:09.558 --> 54:09.618
No.

54:09.638 --> 54:10.979
I'm being polite because I'm in your house.

54:12.160 --> 54:15.404
When you're in my house, there'll be fights, there'll be razors.

54:17.866 --> 54:18.907
I'm so glad you like that.

54:19.588 --> 54:22.070
I'm faintly embarrassed of this fucking film.

54:22.130 --> 54:32.161
I hope they don't notice this when I take this back and they might screw me for nothing.

54:32.181 --> 54:33.462
All right, 1738.

54:33.482 --> 54:33.582
Okay.

54:34.439 --> 54:34.799
1726.

54:34.820 --> 54:35.000
1738.

54:35.040 --> 54:36.402
Okay.

54:36.422 --> 54:41.629
And he actually says that it's 1738.

54:41.649 --> 54:43.031
1740.

54:43.191 --> 54:45.915
Oh, that's great.

54:51.943 --> 54:52.203
Great.

54:52.904 --> 54:53.545
Oh, that's wonderful.

55:01.591 --> 55:03.233
He likes me.

55:03.253 --> 55:08.659
I'm feeling slightly better now.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.281
You see, why wouldn't he talk to me?

55:10.602 --> 55:11.563
He doesn't like you.

55:12.804 --> 55:13.846
I would have been good to him.

55:13.866 --> 55:15.948
He loves me.

55:15.968 --> 55:18.511
Yeah, I mean... He loves me.

55:18.591 --> 55:19.132
I'm English.

55:19.613 --> 55:19.993
I'm cute.

55:20.053 --> 55:21.114
I've got a nice accent.

55:21.134 --> 55:21.355
You are.

55:21.375 --> 55:21.975
I've got some stories.

55:22.296 --> 55:24.558
I found a story with the bedroom eyes.

55:24.578 --> 55:25.860
What was that story that I found?

55:26.093 --> 55:30.478
What was that story I found in a LexisNexis search and Neil?

55:30.679 --> 55:39.810
The Bedroom Eyes, Stockhead Gorgeous, come hither.

55:39.970 --> 55:41.151
I emailed it to Nicole.

55:43.114 --> 55:43.714
Thank you so much.

55:43.734 --> 55:45.296
Stockhead Gorgeous.

55:45.396 --> 55:46.398
Thank you.

55:46.598 --> 55:49.802
The Bedroom Eyes.

55:49.922 --> 55:51.063
What's the name of the show he's in?

55:51.083 --> 55:51.624
You want to tell me?

55:51.664 --> 55:52.945
Stockhead Donkey.

55:53.526 --> 55:55.088
That's the news cover.

55:55.355 --> 55:56.256
Oh, boy.

55:56.957 --> 55:58.379
Gosh.

55:58.519 --> 56:03.666
God Almighty, I've been researched.

56:03.686 --> 56:05.489
We could do a LexisNexis search.

56:05.649 --> 56:07.271
Is there anybody you'd like to do a search on?

56:07.291 --> 56:08.914
It takes a few minutes.

56:09.174 --> 56:13.480
I mean, it's every story that's been published in the English-speaking world in the last 20 years.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.241
Oh, really?

56:14.575 --> 56:16.738
cost me 200 bucks a month for this service.

56:16.758 --> 56:19.861
It's a very, but it's fantastic.

56:19.881 --> 56:24.407
To me, it's not quite up there with sex, but pretty close.

56:24.427 --> 56:25.968
It's a news archive, yeah?

56:25.989 --> 56:27.811
It's called LexisNexis, yeah.

56:27.871 --> 56:33.157
It's a professional... Well, I'll email you because there are a few in the... Jim Casper interview.

56:33.177 --> 56:35.860
Oh, Casper, yeah.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.063
Nicole, go log on AOL.

56:38.744 --> 56:39.925
And then when you get on AOL,

56:40.276 --> 56:45.182
Go to Netscape and go to Lexnex and tell me when you get it on and then we'll plug on and just punch up search.

56:45.202 --> 56:46.824
You'll have to tell me the password.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.466
There's no password needed.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.168
It's already in there.

56:51.309 --> 56:51.409
Yeah.

56:51.429 --> 56:51.549
Okay.

56:51.569 --> 56:52.010
It's in there.

56:52.350 --> 56:52.791
Okay.

56:54.152 --> 56:54.873
Go to search.

57:02.642 --> 57:03.363
What was that?

57:03.463 --> 57:08.069
She's a good kid, isn't she?

57:08.089 --> 57:09.270
I heard that was in your stomach.

57:09.689 --> 57:12.031
No, it's a baby toy.

57:12.092 --> 57:13.813
I forgot to be in college.

57:15.015 --> 57:16.716
She got it at the baby store for me.

57:16.736 --> 57:19.319
Have you ever seen this?

57:19.339 --> 57:23.523
How does it work?

57:23.543 --> 57:24.825
Simple pleasure.

57:31.432 --> 57:35.696
We'll give it another ten minutes or so.

57:35.756 --> 57:36.897
We'll have to kill that bottle.

57:36.957 --> 57:39.460
Now you've got mail.

57:40.199 --> 57:44.350
Just see who it's from.

57:45.072 --> 57:48.441
Debbie at I-W-L-A dot org.

57:49.484 --> 57:50.928
Let it go.

57:50.948 --> 57:52.071
Deep delete it.

57:52.151 --> 57:52.251
Okay.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.764
This is now very heavy bullshit coming after you.

58:16.585 --> 58:17.606
No, it's education.

58:24.174 --> 58:24.835
Because I like this.

58:26.437 --> 58:29.221
How long can these things run, these little bits?

58:29.241 --> 58:29.842
Hour and a quarter.

58:30.162 --> 58:30.522
Not bad.

58:35.869 --> 58:38.412
On the screen.

58:38.553 --> 58:38.893
Thanks.

59:20.082 --> 59:38.207
Good question.

59:38.227 --> 59:39.188
Happy childhood.

01:00:00.683 --> 01:00:02.568
dead.

01:00:02.588 --> 01:00:03.290
The king is dead.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.296
Long live the king.

01:00:06.259 --> 01:00:07.281
Don't forget these here.

01:00:07.602 --> 01:00:12.195
We'll wrap this up again soon.
