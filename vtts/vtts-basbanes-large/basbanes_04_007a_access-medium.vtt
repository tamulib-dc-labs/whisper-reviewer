00:09.447 --> 00:10.128
Hello.

00:10.148 --> 00:11.710
Hi, this is Nick Basbanes.

00:13.171 --> 00:13.952
How are you doing?

00:14.252 --> 00:15.274
All right, thanks.

00:15.514 --> 00:16.515
I'm sorry about that.

00:17.016 --> 00:23.203
The call went straight through and was charged to my phone, which was not what we had in mind.

00:23.223 --> 00:26.066
This doesn't have to concern you, but we just took care of it.

00:28.408 --> 00:37.699
Anyway, I've read your book, and my 14-year-old daughter, who knows computers, has read your book.

00:37.679 --> 00:38.300
Oh, right.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.021
And she read it.

00:39.041 --> 00:42.787
Of course, kids, you know, they read faster than adults, I think.

00:42.807 --> 00:47.315
But anyway, very interesting.

00:47.615 --> 00:53.525
Susan tells me in New York that you just sold another concept to the movies.

00:53.545 --> 00:53.985
Is that right?

00:54.486 --> 00:55.307
I sold another novel.

00:55.668 --> 00:57.651
Another novel, but I guess it's still in progress.

00:57.711 --> 00:58.172
Is that right?

00:59.053 --> 00:59.434
Well, it's...

01:00.157 --> 01:01.620
More or less finished.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.883
I've got a bit of editing left to do.

01:04.524 --> 01:05.386
What's the title of that?

01:05.787 --> 01:06.668
It's called Esau.

01:07.009 --> 01:08.231
How do you spell?

01:08.251 --> 01:10.174
As in the Bible, E-S-A-U.

01:11.376 --> 01:13.580
Oh, you like these biblical names, huh?

01:14.001 --> 01:16.545
Yeah, I can't do that.

01:17.015 --> 01:21.161
You know, I was brought up as a Baptist.

01:21.201 --> 01:21.401
I see.

01:21.842 --> 01:29.312
Briefly, because we're really to talk about the grid, but is Esau kind of a son of Isaac, I wonder, or what?

01:29.352 --> 01:30.674
No, no, it's nothing to do with that.

01:30.694 --> 01:32.857
It's actually the name of a fossil.

01:32.877 --> 01:33.018
Uh-huh.

01:33.438 --> 01:36.022
Oh, boy, you're really doing the time leaps here, aren't you?

01:36.122 --> 01:36.222
Yeah.

01:36.691 --> 01:42.422
No, the Esau is about paleoanthropology.

01:43.264 --> 01:45.187
Say again, what kind of anthropology?

01:45.207 --> 01:45.348
Paleo.

01:45.368 --> 01:46.149
Paleo, okay.

01:46.169 --> 01:47.311
Yeah, to do with human origin.

01:47.331 --> 01:47.973
I see.

01:48.013 --> 01:50.638
It's a contemporary setting?

01:50.698 --> 01:55.747
Yeah, it's a contemporary novel, which is my next novel after The Grid.

01:55.988 --> 01:59.695
Well, I would have thought that your next novel after The Grid would be a sequel.

02:00.215 --> 02:00.896
Uh-huh.

02:00.917 --> 02:04.544
Well, that's... You certainly set yourself up for that, don't you?

02:05.246 --> 02:06.549
Well, yeah.

02:06.569 --> 02:07.110
I don't know.

02:07.150 --> 02:07.571
I don't know.

02:07.631 --> 02:09.275
Oh, come on now.

02:09.776 --> 02:12.261
We're downloading to 100 computers.

02:12.662 --> 02:16.350
Not that I'm going to give this away, but... This is true, but I mean...

02:17.107 --> 02:17.748
I don't know.

02:17.768 --> 02:26.458
I mean, you see, when I first started writing, I wrote three novels featuring one character, Trot, by which I mean one after the other.

02:26.999 --> 02:36.690
And I kind of now prefer to sort of do something completely different every time rather than just repeat the same trick.

02:36.730 --> 02:44.700
It seems to me, as a novelist, that, you know, there are lots and lots of ways you can get bored

02:44.680 --> 02:46.744
with what you're doing.

02:48.127 --> 02:54.378
And it strikes me that the best way to keep interested is to take a few risks.

02:54.479 --> 03:00.049
And the best way to take a few risks is often to write about something about which you know very little.

03:01.873 --> 03:07.363
And come at it fresh and acquaint yourself with the subject.

03:07.343 --> 03:10.588
You have a kind of convert's enthusiasm then.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.894
So I'm not sure I would write a sequel.

03:15.696 --> 03:29.757
I mean, never say never again, but I mean, I don't know if writing sequels... You know, I remember, this is interesting, and we can go in a number of directions with this, but I remember sitting with Michael Crichton in Boston.

03:30.530 --> 03:34.674
oh, however many years ago it was when Jurassic Park came out.

03:35.255 --> 03:37.897
And I remember saying, Michael, you set yourself up here for a sequel.

03:37.917 --> 03:42.622
You've got these velociraptors, you know, trekking off into the wilderness.

03:42.902 --> 03:43.783
Oh, no, no, no.

03:43.823 --> 03:44.444
He said, really?

03:44.504 --> 03:46.586
Well, you know, then, of course, he wrote a sequel.

03:46.606 --> 03:50.650
The difference, of course, is a $660 million gracing film with Steven Spielberg.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.813
It does certainly make you pay attention, doesn't it?

03:53.933 --> 03:54.153
Exactly.

03:54.173 --> 03:58.377
I mean, you know, ask me again if I'm so lucky, you know,

03:58.357 --> 04:02.603
And, of course, the fact is the sequel was very unsatisfying as far as I'm concerned.

04:02.623 --> 04:03.044
The novel?

04:03.244 --> 04:04.586
The novel, yeah.

04:04.927 --> 04:06.629
I think I'd probably go along with you there.

04:06.649 --> 04:08.933
I don't even think I finished it, to be honest with you.

04:08.953 --> 04:11.056
I mean, it just didn't engage me at all.

04:11.577 --> 04:15.463
I think possibly, you know, if the novelist isn't engaged, obviously the reader won't be.

04:15.483 --> 04:18.407
I think this is a problem with a lot of modern fiction,

04:18.944 --> 04:42.876
uh commercial fiction, I mean you know, I think Grisham's problem is, he's really sort of writing the same book. Yeah well Grisham's got a lot of problems as far as i'm concerned. Yeah I mean you know I think because the idea, this is something I've always wanted to avoid. It's like I just want to sort of write things that are going to interest me first, and if I feel if I'm interested then the reader will be too, I hope so uh so you're right. I mean I've moved from

04:43.598 --> 04:45.983
architecture to anthropology.

04:46.003 --> 04:47.487
So I guess I'm moving through here.

04:47.507 --> 04:49.150
Well, I think it's more than architecture.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.536
I think the grid is far more than architecture.

04:52.077 --> 04:52.939
Well, I'm glad you think so.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.683
Thank you.

04:55.645 --> 04:59.273
I mean, do you see it as a cautionary tale, in fact?

04:59.955 --> 05:00.055
Well,

05:01.098 --> 05:01.919
Thought of, yes.

05:01.959 --> 05:12.655
I mean, I sort of think, I mean, I had lots and lots of sort of themes in mind when I was writing it, but not least the sort of lemming-like rush to computerize the world.

05:12.795 --> 05:21.267
I mean, you know, for a long time I felt that the novelists have let science get away from them.

05:21.854 --> 05:25.979
Probably because most of us, most of them don't understand it, you know.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.501
Exactly, yeah, exactly.

05:27.701 --> 05:31.005
And yet, you know, you look back to the beginning of the century and you had people like H.G.

05:31.025 --> 05:35.370
Wells writing novels that actually influenced scientists.

05:35.650 --> 05:41.977
I mean, Leo Szilard, who was one of the nuclear scientists, who was on the Manhattan Project.

05:42.218 --> 05:44.160
How do you spell his name?

05:44.600 --> 05:45.481
S-Z-I-L-A-R-D.

05:45.682 --> 05:46.022
Okay.

05:46.390 --> 05:51.978
He actually read Wells' book, The World Set Free, which was about nuclear weapons.

05:52.719 --> 05:59.830
And Wells wrote this book despite the fact that Rutherford had said that nuclear weapons were impossible.

06:01.012 --> 06:04.517
But when Leo Szilard read Wells' book, he said...

06:05.206 --> 06:14.766
This is possible, and I have to get a group of like-minded people together to get to Einstein and get him to say something to the American president to this effect.

06:15.307 --> 06:23.584
And I thought, well, recently I've been thinking, well, it's almost impossible to imagine something similar happening today, that a novelist could influence a scientist.

06:24.646 --> 06:25.307
And yet...

06:26.013 --> 06:27.855
there is so much popular science around.

06:27.875 --> 06:51.302
In a way, although science has sort of got away from writers and artists, and a gulf has sort of grown up between the two communities, the sort of advent of the popular science book has meant that it's actually quite easy to get a handle on some science and to sort of, in a way, sometimes make science more intelligible to the ordinary reader.

06:51.322 --> 06:54.906
No, I think one thing I like about the grid...

06:55.240 --> 07:01.656
And it has a lot in common with what I really liked about Jurassic Park is that

07:02.463 --> 07:31.997
it's a premise to be sure, but it's a goddamn credible premise. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I mean you know what Michael did with the DNA hey that's a that's a they say it's far-fetched, but it's a credible, what if you know maybe if you can extract DNA from amber and you can replicate and clone things, well who knows? Yeah now it seems to me that computers are really taking over the world in a very frightening kind of a way, and and you know they're

07:31.977 --> 07:35.322
I have to say, before I read the PW review,

07:35.825 --> 07:46.600
I also felt that, you know, there are resonances here in your book from 2001 to be sure you have the hell computer going to run amok.

07:47.240 --> 07:52.908
And also in a very fine way, the towering inferno or whatever it was, the glass.

07:53.989 --> 07:55.992
Probably more 2001 than that.

07:56.032 --> 08:02.541
But I think for myself more 2001 because really it is the rogue computer here.

08:02.842 --> 08:08.827
But what amuses me in a way is Kubrick's film was 1968 or 69.

08:09.228 --> 08:18.235
And I think computers today, as you're saying, are far more sophisticated in 1996 than they ever imagined they would be in 2001.

08:18.356 --> 08:21.238
I mean, is that a fair assessment?

08:21.258 --> 08:21.658
No, it is.

08:21.779 --> 08:22.900
I mean, that is absolutely true.

08:22.920 --> 08:32.528
And that's, you know, it's the idea that we're swiftly approaching a sort of state when the mathematical philosophers

08:32.913 --> 08:39.900
tell us that the machines will actually invent the transcendent machine, i.e., the ultimate machine.

08:41.141 --> 08:47.587
Basically, when machines are entrusted with their own replication, and we're not so very far away from that now.

08:47.607 --> 08:51.891
Most computers are involved in the manufacture of silicon chips and other computers.

08:53.012 --> 09:00.699
Not only will machines be manufacturing other machines, but also with the internet, there'll be a kind of global link-up.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.481
And so it is...

09:02.815 --> 09:12.265
It is fair to talk about the advent of a global machine, one whole machine, because after all, when all these machines are connected, they will all be linked.

09:13.486 --> 09:20.393
So, you know, it's difficult to imagine what the sort of possible consequences of such a thing might be.

09:20.674 --> 09:21.875
If you have a rogue machine.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.297
If you have a rogue machine.

09:24.357 --> 09:25.318
Exactly, yeah.

09:25.338 --> 09:31.725
But of course, I mean, the very point of some of these machines is to sort of make human workers redundant.

09:32.262 --> 09:43.072
And the question, it begs the question then, you know, if we get to a stage when the machines are inventing machines and man has virtually nothing to do with it, then what will man be doing?

09:43.112 --> 09:45.734
I mean, just sort of being amused in a corner.

09:46.034 --> 09:46.875
What's happening now?

09:46.915 --> 09:58.425
I don't know if it's happening in England, but I mean, people are highly qualified, educated people are losing their jobs and they're forced to find, you know, service jobs.

09:58.445 --> 09:58.626
Yeah.

09:58.646 --> 10:00.227
Being a fraction of the...

10:00.511 --> 10:23.430
uh the money they earned prior to that, and machines are doing the whole damn thing you know. Well I mean I don't mean to sort of make myself sound like some sort of luddite you know, and I'm coming along smashing sort of spinning jenny uh machines uh in the sort of English cotton mills in the 19th century, but um I do do feel that you know um there is sort of stupidity about a lot of computerization

10:23.866 --> 10:35.882
that, you know, people try and sort of make computers do the jobs that humans can do without actually sort of answering the responsibilities of a society.

10:36.262 --> 10:41.469
You know, what do people do when their jobs have been taken away from them by computers?

10:41.529 --> 10:50.401
And in the novel, you know, the woman who works in the detective's wife who works in a museum, her job has been effectively taken by a compact disc.

10:50.802 --> 10:52.624
And so I kind of think, well...

10:53.077 --> 11:00.728
Do we want to live in a kind of society where the interaction we might have with a museum will only be through a compact disc?

11:00.748 --> 11:02.550
I mean, it isn't much fun.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.252
So why did you pick L.A.?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.935
This could have been anywhere, really, I suppose.

11:05.955 --> 11:06.616
Well, I picked L.A.

11:06.636 --> 11:07.297
for a number of reasons.

11:07.457 --> 11:09.219
There were very practical reasons.

11:10.161 --> 11:11.082
Number one, I mean, L.A.

11:11.102 --> 11:15.508
is... The price of real estate in the downtown area is quite high.

11:17.190 --> 11:21.396
You have to generally build an intelligent building in a place where...

11:21.629 --> 11:22.911
in that kind of place.

11:23.212 --> 11:28.442
Also, the thing about L.A., which appealed to me from the concept of a smart building, was that L.A.

11:28.682 --> 11:32.430
is full of what the architects call defensible architecture.

11:32.450 --> 11:39.503
The idea, I think what Mike Davis has called in his book, City of Courts, fuck you architecture.

11:39.787 --> 11:43.210
I keep off the grass, you know, armed response patrols.

11:43.651 --> 11:50.397
Well, I love the way you set up the, you know, at nighttime where the bums can't even lie down.

11:50.457 --> 11:54.380
I wish I could put some of that stuff up around here, you know.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.421
Well, this is the point, you see.

11:55.441 --> 12:02.648
It's like, you know, all these things sound great until you realize that not only are they keeping people away, but they're keeping you in.

12:02.668 --> 12:03.209
That's right.

12:03.729 --> 12:06.992
So this was the sort of the irony, the sort of the sense of...

12:06.972 --> 12:32.237
fascination with this kind of this kind of world you know and LA of course is the absolute paradigm of this kind of society in which people are frightened. Take a walk take a walk through Grand Central Terminal in New York sometime. Yeah you know that's that's true as well. Well I mean you get out of the Oyster Bar, which is a wonderful little restaurant, and you can actually see through the windows all these people eating at nice crisp tablecloths yeah

12:32.217 --> 12:32.838
Lovely.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.861
And all these bums.

12:33.941 --> 12:36.807
Literally, you could take a beautiful photograph right outside.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.674
The bums lying down in the passageways.

12:39.714 --> 12:40.716
And then it's the people.

12:40.756 --> 12:42.680
Actually, I should do that sometime.

12:42.741 --> 12:44.444
It's an Oliver Twist, isn't it?

12:44.625 --> 12:45.507
Yeah, it really is.

12:45.547 --> 12:50.057
That and a number of other reasons.

12:50.425 --> 12:51.446
you know, why L.A.

12:51.526 --> 12:52.708
sort of appealed, really.

12:52.828 --> 12:56.092
Yeah, but now, clearly, I mean, I know L.A.

12:56.332 --> 12:57.133
pretty well, too.

12:57.153 --> 13:01.238
You seem to have gotten a handle on it and on the culture and the nuances of L.A.

13:01.298 --> 13:01.499
life.

13:01.979 --> 13:04.042
You must have had to spend a bit of time out there.

13:04.643 --> 13:05.684
Well, I'm in and out of L.A.

13:05.864 --> 13:08.287
You know, I've just come back from L.A., actually.

13:08.307 --> 13:12.232
You know, I was there last week speaking to sort of film people.

13:12.352 --> 13:15.857
So, I mean, you know, it's the kind of place that also I think L.A.

13:16.037 --> 13:18.660
is the kind of place that everybody knows.

13:18.809 --> 13:24.641
Because, of course, it's the sort of preeminent cultural model in television.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.048
Half the television series you see are based in L.A.

13:28.068 --> 13:28.649
anyway.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.994
Half the movies you see are in L.A.

13:31.014 --> 13:34.742
So, in fact, I think people in this country and in Europe have a much...

13:35.380 --> 13:37.363
clearer idea of what L.A.

13:37.463 --> 13:43.090
looks like and what it's like to live there, even people who've never been there, than, say, people who live in L.A.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.712
who, you know, be thinking about London.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.274
I mean, people in L.A.

13:46.354 --> 13:52.021
still persist in the misapparantion that London has, you know, pea-souper fogs.

13:52.041 --> 13:57.909
And I, you know, I'm sort of frequently telling people in L.A., even sort of intelligent people, you know, that actually L.A.'s

13:57.889 --> 14:04.257
own fogs are considerably more frequent and more dense than anything they ever have in London.

14:04.557 --> 14:33.298
As I think of it, this book wouldn't work in New York either, uh it just wouldn't it wouldn't work in New York, I don't think. No I don't think, I mean the other thing about downtown of course is it's a sort of you know it has it's full of the sort of this kind of grandiose architecture anyway, but at the same time of course it's completely empty at night, you know it's sort of. See that that's exactly what I'm saying. That wouldn't work in New York there would be a tension in New York. Yeah. People would be alert to what the hell is going on over there you know. Yeah.

14:33.599 --> 14:40.410
So really going back to the premise then, you said an architecture book, and I said, well, I think it's more than that.

14:40.430 --> 14:45.197
Did you see it originally as an architecture book with the computer element thrown in?

14:45.578 --> 14:49.745
I saw it first in terms of the character.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.087
The character being the computer?

14:51.568 --> 14:58.138
The guy who is the architectologist, Ray Richardson, who sort of conceives of the whole thing.

14:58.321 --> 15:07.318
But, you know, the idea that sort of buildings, new buildings are actually sort of have much more in common with kind of spacecraft.

15:07.771 --> 15:10.795
than, you know, even buildings going up 20 years ago.

15:11.316 --> 15:15.923
And I thought also the ego of the character as well was what interested me.

15:16.083 --> 15:31.025
I mean, it's enough of a thrill to see your book on the shelf in a bookstore, but what it must be like to drive past, you know, some great sort of huge building and realize that you've not only designed it, but you built it and everything.

15:31.065 --> 15:34.570
That's really what was one of the sort of prime things that started me off.

15:34.590 --> 15:35.972
I mean, it's very difficult to sort of

15:35.952 --> 15:38.695
ever put your finger on the first thing you thought of.

15:38.815 --> 15:46.304
Is there an echo of Melville, I wonder, where he throws himself into the jaws of the fire at the end?

15:46.725 --> 15:50.029
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.172
There's a sense of being inside of Wales.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.273
Yeah, it really is.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.877
There's a point there I thought he was going to make it, you know.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.584
You really did knock off everybody, didn't you?

16:03.121 --> 16:04.524
My daughter asked me about that.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.767
I said, well, honey, this is tough.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.435
This machine is one tough machine.

16:09.495 --> 16:20.320
Well, you see, again, it's one that sort of sits back sometimes and you realize that the writer plays God and sometimes your first tendency is to be

16:20.300 --> 16:21.942
is to be merciless.

16:22.403 --> 16:26.789
And then sometimes you draw back and think, well, you know, I'm sentimental, I like these characters.

16:26.829 --> 16:28.932
Well, I mean, we've already figured the scenario.

16:28.952 --> 16:42.210
You've kept Kuretus, you've got the woman that he likes, and you've got a hundred machines now that are going to be sons of Ishmael here, or Isaac, whatever his name is.

16:42.811 --> 16:43.472
And...

16:43.722 --> 16:48.128
fully 90 of them right off the bat aren't going to be able to handle it.

16:48.168 --> 16:53.817
You have to have a setup where you can't turn it off.

16:53.837 --> 16:57.562
That's critical here, the fact that he can defeat anything you throw at him.

16:57.602 --> 16:59.004
He's got supplementary power.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.731
It really is scary.

17:03.751 --> 17:10.601
The other thing that interests me, I'm remembering things as I'm speaking to you half the time.

17:10.641 --> 17:13.645
I started playing a few computer games myself.

17:13.760 --> 17:19.586
And it was the idea of actually, you know, the general fascination that people have in offices playing computer games.

17:19.626 --> 17:29.136
And I thought, well, wouldn't it be nice if the people who were, you know, who were supposed to be working, who were playing computer games, actually turned out to be in a computer game themselves.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.198
And they, you know, they didn't really know it.

17:31.979 --> 17:39.126
That was another thing that sort of... Now, in your mind's eye, is it the circumstance of the boy...

17:39.730 --> 17:46.839
playing his own little games there, what set the machine off, or was it disposed to go to become a serial killer?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.048
Well, I think it seems...

17:50.125 --> 17:54.652
One of the points of the book is that we have to kind of change the way we think about computers.

17:56.134 --> 18:01.262
We have a tendency to sort of anthropomorphize, to humanize computers, to imagine them thinking.

18:01.282 --> 18:04.848
Yeah, but you do that by setting up in the chess game there, you know.

18:05.088 --> 18:07.412
We actually see it, which I think is wonderful, by the way.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.515
I can really see that in the movie.

18:09.535 --> 18:13.922
That'll be a very, very chilling moment when this figure...

18:13.902 --> 18:17.488
No, yeah, that's really spectacular.

18:17.508 --> 18:18.490
But go ahead, I interrupted.

18:18.650 --> 18:21.334
But you anthropomorphize it yourself, I think.

18:21.535 --> 18:22.456
Well, I think, yeah.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.999
I mean, you even give us computer talk.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.702
It's the nature that we do it.

18:26.323 --> 18:33.835
You know, the computers do things, you ask them a question, they give you an answer, and it's quite understandable that we should...

18:33.815 --> 18:36.779
look on it as being a kind of brain.

18:37.039 --> 18:40.785
But of course, you know, in hard mathematical terms, it's nothing like that.

18:40.825 --> 18:46.372
So, you know, to look for a computer having a motive, of course, is incorrect.

18:46.513 --> 18:49.236
That is the great leap, then, that you make here, I guess.

18:49.777 --> 18:50.598
Would you agree with that?

18:50.859 --> 18:51.119
Yes.

18:52.100 --> 18:52.441
Go ahead.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.485
No, I think, I mean, you know, we have to sort of

18:55.837 --> 18:57.600
We have to change our language.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.484
We have to change the way we talk about computers.

19:00.524 --> 19:02.788
I mean, you really do give the computer a motive here.

19:03.789 --> 19:05.632
Well, I give it an apparent motive, yes.

19:06.273 --> 19:09.719
And of course, this is very seductive for human beings.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.563
It is a very...

19:13.032 --> 19:17.160
it is a very seductive thought that a computer will have a motive.

19:17.882 --> 19:28.242
And equally, when you've, I mean, they are already building computers that are equipped with what the computer programmers call an observer illusion.

19:28.763 --> 19:33.032
The sense that the computer has a responsibility and an awareness

19:33.451 --> 19:51.088
of itself, but of course this is just a program. This is just a sort of series of binary instructions, but of course if you give if you endow a machine with this, you know, you encourage it almost to sort of try and you know look look for some answers itself, and I think this is what the sort of um

19:51.068 --> 19:58.266
This is, again, sort of something that one regards as being perhaps slightly sort of hazardous.

19:58.667 --> 20:03.639
And how much did you know about computers prior to undertaking this task?

20:03.900 --> 20:08.892
Well, I mean, like most people, I mean, I can sit down in front of the computer and get on with it and work it.

20:08.872 --> 20:09.833
reasonably well.

20:09.853 --> 20:14.801
I mean, you know, taking it to pieces is a different story.

20:14.981 --> 20:23.454
I think I'm sort of slightly more in touch with the sort of, if you like, the philosophy of computing, which comes through the philosophy of mathematics.

20:23.714 --> 20:31.586
And this is something I sort of was more interested in than, you know, how a computer actually works.

20:31.847 --> 20:35.352
It's how programs actually are

20:35.635 --> 20:45.608
how the sort of profits are telling us that the programs will actually change as the world goes on.

20:46.469 --> 20:48.972
Well, what's the production schedule for the film?

20:50.173 --> 20:52.857
Well, they've already got the script.

20:53.337 --> 20:53.878
Did you write it?

20:54.198 --> 20:54.879
No, I didn't, no.

20:54.959 --> 20:59.365
I have a sort of personal philosophy about

20:59.935 --> 21:22.112
script writing and novels I think. Yeah what if they offer you, this is off the record, what if they offer you two million dollars to write the scripts? You know I mean that's what these guys get sometimes. Uh well yeah I mean they can, I mean they can be often better paid than the novelist. Oh they are. Not often they are. Yeah well I mean I have my own book out there right now too. It's not a novel it's a

21:22.092 --> 21:28.298
You know, we bust our asses to make a very small little royalty on 50,000 books or something like that, you know.

21:28.698 --> 21:35.004
And then some guy comes along and they give him a million and a half bucks or whatever to do a 120-page treatment for a film.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.685
More power to him.

21:36.705 --> 21:40.449
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm a scriptwriter myself.

21:40.469 --> 21:42.831
I mean, I do write scripts.

21:43.251 --> 21:45.774
But not from your own novels.

21:45.834 --> 21:49.517
No, well, you see, I consider the very act of having finished the novel.

21:49.750 --> 21:55.022
It means that in a way I've become, I've reached a point when I don't feel I can go forward with it anymore.

21:55.583 --> 21:56.926
It's like sort of finishing a painting.

21:57.467 --> 22:08.772
You know, I don't feel that, you know, if I then had to sell the painting to someone and they said, well, what we'd like you to do is come in and sort of change this bit and change that bit, then I'd sort of feel, you know,

22:09.140 --> 22:10.742
I'd feel very awkward about doing that.

22:11.363 --> 22:23.656
And often I've found from friends that people who are writers who, you know, they sell their book, they agree to write the screenplay for more money, and they find that the screenplay takes more time than the novel actually in the first place.

22:24.037 --> 22:26.920
So I sort of kind of feel, well, I don't want to go through that.

22:26.940 --> 22:30.084
I've been through it once.

22:30.144 --> 22:31.045
Which case was that?

22:31.786 --> 22:33.848
I wrote a novel called Dead Meat.

22:33.828 --> 22:35.310
which is about the Russian Mafia.

22:36.151 --> 22:42.020
And I then had to turn it into a sort of three-part television series for the BBC.

22:42.681 --> 22:52.556
And in actual fact, it was infinitely more grief to me working on the script than it was actually just writing the novel.

22:52.616 --> 22:53.457
I mean, the novel is...

22:54.398 --> 22:56.200
You're your own master, really.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.781
There's less interference.

22:58.442 --> 23:01.425
I mean, as I say, I enjoy writing screenplays.

23:01.445 --> 23:05.049
I just prefer to come and work on somebody else's rather than my own.

23:05.229 --> 23:10.835
You know, it's like the very things that you need to chuck out and get rid of as a script writer.

23:10.935 --> 23:13.738
How do you visualize yourself as a writer?

23:13.938 --> 23:16.901
I mean, clearly this book, I mean, it's written very visually.

23:17.742 --> 23:18.402
It's exciting.

23:18.422 --> 23:19.123
It's a thriller.

23:20.133 --> 23:25.197
It's undoubtedly written with the idea that a film will be made from it, which I think is wonderful.

23:25.217 --> 23:27.619
I think it'll make a wonderful movie.

23:27.640 --> 23:27.840
Thank you.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.561
And I love movies, and I love thrillers.

23:29.581 --> 23:35.306
I mean, I write a literary column, but, you know, the stuff... I read your book on vacation in Florida two weeks ago.

23:36.007 --> 23:39.790
Susan said, Oh, I'm so happy that the book you took to Florida with you was The Grid.

23:39.810 --> 23:44.174
You know, I could have taken 25 different books, but I wanted to be entertained, you know.

23:45.195 --> 23:45.355
Sure.

23:45.515 --> 23:48.958
Well, I see myself... I mean, I'm glad you think it was entertaining, because I see myself first.

23:49.478 --> 23:50.419
as an entertainer.

23:50.980 --> 23:58.151
I mean, if I think you can do just about anything, you can say just about anything, as long as you've taken the trouble to entertain the reader first.

23:58.853 --> 24:04.862
And this seems to be a rather lamentable tendency amongst writers, certainly in Britain now.

24:04.882 --> 24:06.985
It's a kind of very parochial kind of writing.

24:07.346 --> 24:09.930
It's also a kind of writing that's almost contemptuous.

24:10.310 --> 24:14.577
Well, I mean, you have to apologize for engaging your readers, I guess.

24:14.797 --> 24:16.600
Yeah, and story has become almost...

24:17.018 --> 24:18.089
Irrelevant.

24:18.231 --> 24:20.818
And I feel, well,

24:21.338 --> 24:27.888
You know, that's a shame, but it can only benefit me in the sense that I enjoy entertaining and I enjoy telling a story.

24:28.068 --> 24:32.895
And obviously in Hollywood there is a tremendous appetite for good stories.

24:32.955 --> 24:38.263
Well, a good friend of mine who is so derided by the critics is Pat Conroy.

24:38.504 --> 24:40.507
I love his stuff.

24:40.667 --> 24:48.539
But people look down their noses at him because how could anybody that popular be any good?

24:48.659 --> 24:49.320
I mean,

24:49.300 --> 24:50.666
This is what people think, isn't it?

24:51.369 --> 24:56.492
It's so ridiculous, and I was so amused by that Martin Amis thing last year, you know,

24:56.776 --> 25:02.503
I mean, the poor bastard went out and he actually made some money, you know, and they kick his ass for it, you know.

25:02.523 --> 25:12.495
It's unforgivable, of course, if you come from that milieu, you know, if you come from that very sort of Bloomsbury world of English letters, which sort of is this vein full of money, as you say.

25:13.457 --> 25:16.080
Of course, Martin wants it both ways, too, though.

25:16.140 --> 25:20.185
He still wants to be recognized as the writer of his generation, but, you know,

25:20.165 --> 25:21.046
That's right.

25:21.127 --> 25:25.854
So, I mean, sometimes you have to say about which way it might go, you know, left to right.

25:25.874 --> 25:30.722
You see, I think that also a lot of novels seem to purposely try and make it difficult for the reader.

25:31.363 --> 25:31.964
You know what I mean?

25:31.984 --> 25:37.633
I mean, I think, you know, they just seem to almost set out to make it as hard as possible for the readers to get on with the book.

25:37.673 --> 25:39.095
And I think, well, why?

25:39.115 --> 25:44.484
You know, I mean, there are, you know, I mean, I think it's silly to do that.

25:44.504 --> 25:47.809
You sort of risk, to take risks in losing your readers.

25:48.025 --> 25:50.608
seems counterproductive.

25:50.668 --> 25:55.092
I prefer to sort of try and seduce the reader and get them hooked on the story.

25:55.112 --> 26:10.889
And then at that stage, if you do have the author's message, if you like, that comes along, then let it be sort of at a point when you think the reader has been sufficiently entertained that they want to go on, but that they will stop and pay attention to whatever you have to say.

26:10.989 --> 26:14.573
One little critical point, and I just offer it as an observation.

26:14.553 --> 26:19.287
I have to say, I had trouble with the book keeping the characters straight.

26:19.307 --> 26:19.588
Yeah.

26:19.608 --> 26:20.310
There were a lot of them.

26:20.691 --> 26:22.617
And saying, who the fuck is this one or that one?

26:22.657 --> 26:23.961
You know, I mean... Right.

26:23.981 --> 26:26.368
This is the trouble when you're writing a sort of, you know...

26:26.753 --> 26:52.086
um a multicast story. I mean and of course where it is multicast, uh you do have to characterize them pretty quickly in one paragraph or so, and you tend to forget these things and trying to keep them straight. Now who the hell is this one? I mean uh and I did say I did have to feel, you know I mean Curtis was the guy who does emerge, and yeah uh and Ray of course, and the woman, uh but boy some all of these others

26:52.066 --> 27:02.093
Well, the chess guy was pretty interesting. That's your phone or fax.

27:04.553 --> 27:06.074
But it was pretty interesting.

27:06.094 --> 27:08.096
And, you know, I never found out how it ended up.

27:08.116 --> 27:09.017
Maybe you can tell me.

27:09.037 --> 27:10.519
But a couple of weeks ago, I went out.

27:10.539 --> 27:11.920
I did a tour on the West Coast.

27:11.960 --> 27:12.540
I was gone.

27:13.441 --> 27:18.066
And when I went out, there was this chess match going on between an IBM computer.

27:18.346 --> 27:18.706
Oh, yes.

27:18.726 --> 27:19.567
And Gary Kasparov.

27:19.747 --> 27:20.167
Yeah.

27:20.208 --> 27:20.608
Who won?

27:21.529 --> 27:23.330
Well, Kasparov won the series.

27:23.430 --> 27:23.731
Did he?

27:24.031 --> 27:25.813
Oh, he did win the series.

27:25.873 --> 27:26.974
He had an early defeat.

27:27.354 --> 27:27.534
Yeah.

27:27.614 --> 27:29.856
Well, I mean, they were really scared there for a while.

27:30.497 --> 27:30.837
That's right.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.700
But, I mean, you know, people say it's just a matter of time.

27:34.287 --> 27:36.352
You know, it came pretty darn close.

27:36.453 --> 27:38.137
But this is the best chess player in the world.

27:38.237 --> 27:41.426
Yeah, but it was pretty darn close to losing.

27:42.007 --> 27:42.629
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

27:42.649 --> 27:43.010
You're right.

27:43.090 --> 27:49.427
I mean, you know, it's only a matter of time before, you know, the deep thought configuration of computer

27:49.846 --> 28:16.748
um sort of sees him off. Did he win fairly handily towards the bit towards the uh final? It was a close run thing. I think it was. Say again? It was a close run thing. Oh really? Yeah. No kidding, and he gets 400k good for him. I really was not pulling for the computer, I have to say. Well of course it's not, these days, it wouldn't probably just be Kasparov would it would. You know these guys sort of stopped

28:17.116 --> 28:39.681
stop playing they go back you know have a cup of coffee and they huddle with sort of two or three other guys who are experts, and he'll say you know what about. You mean the computer guys or the Kasparov guy? The Kasparov guy. His team? Yeah so you think he talks with his people, I guess? Sefinitely yeah yeah I mean that's what they do in international grandmaster tournaments anyway. They'll huddle with sort of

28:39.998 --> 28:59.948
people you know their seconds and that. Yeah but the reason I raise this issue, uh because you point this out in your book, and of course it was a faint there. It was pretty successful. I did think that that this thing hinged on the chess game. Yeah or it didn't do? It was just a an irrelevant amusement for the computer right? Yeah exactly.

28:59.928 --> 29:07.017
And I said, there's no way, and especially when I did jump at the back and I saw you had your own game in it, I said, there's no way this guy's going to beat this computer.

29:07.598 --> 29:12.484
Or if he does, it's going to have no relevance whatsoever in the outcome.

29:12.504 --> 29:23.337
It just seemed a nice philosophical irony that the computer could have taken the concept of the game to its ultimate stage.

29:23.806 --> 29:37.928
Well, single combat, you know, that whole concept of single combat, you know, David and Goliath, where the whole outcome of the war is going to depend on these two people who go out and go one-on-one.

29:38.228 --> 29:39.109
Yeah.

29:39.130 --> 29:46.120
And I don't know if you saw it that way when you wrote it, but it's kind of almost a satire on that in a way.

29:46.301 --> 29:47.643
Yeah, well, that's right.

29:47.663 --> 29:47.923
I did have...

29:48.342 --> 29:52.047
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

29:52.067 --> 29:52.868
Well, it was fun.

29:53.568 --> 29:54.269
Let me just think.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.652
We can wrap up shortly if you want.

29:59.696 --> 30:01.338
How solid is the science in here?

30:01.378 --> 30:01.778
How solid?

30:01.798 --> 30:08.907
I mean, did you take steps to... Well, as far as the architecture is concerned and the details of the building, I mean, they're really solid.

30:08.927 --> 30:13.793
I mean, I had a couple of friends who were architects sort of giving me advice.

30:14.077 --> 30:16.700
Do we do have parties that steam clean your ass, though?

30:17.401 --> 30:20.585
Well, in fact, yes.

30:20.605 --> 30:33.641
I was in Japan the year before last, and I was rather astonished to go into a toilet in a friend's house, and it was the first time I'd ever sat down and picked up a laminated set of instructions on how to use the toilet.

30:33.681 --> 30:35.003
How to take a crap, right?

30:35.023 --> 30:35.363
Yeah, exactly.

30:35.383 --> 30:38.827
I mean, you think, well, that's something you ought to know by, you know, get to 14, I think, well, you've got to.

30:39.208 --> 30:43.493
But, no, it wasn't so very different from what was put there, and...

30:44.097 --> 30:47.471
So I just sort of, you know, kind of let my imagination run a bit.

30:47.491 --> 30:51.447
But they do have little, you know, it's a paper-free toilet.

30:51.729 --> 30:52.572
That is genuine.

30:54.442 --> 30:58.550
I've got to tell you, my favorite line, you can guess it in the context here.

30:58.570 --> 30:59.071
Which one?

30:59.131 --> 30:59.492
Tell me.

31:00.674 --> 31:01.315
What kind of one?

31:01.335 --> 31:03.119
Exactly.

31:03.139 --> 31:05.503
Is that something you picked up out there or what?

31:05.523 --> 31:10.092
No, it just sort of, it just tickled me, the idea of this cop.

31:10.132 --> 31:13.018
It seems like the sort of thing a cop would say, actually.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.623
Don't think I haven't used that a couple of times.

31:16.328 --> 31:19.353
Okay, so the next novel is done.

31:19.433 --> 31:24.081
I guess, did we finish the idea, though, that you do see yourself as an entertainer?

31:24.522 --> 31:25.003
Yeah.

31:25.043 --> 31:29.290
You have no illusions that this is commercial fiction, right?

31:29.350 --> 31:30.732
This is commercial fiction.

31:31.173 --> 31:34.118
I like to think, you know, I can...
