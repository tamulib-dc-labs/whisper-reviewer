WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:03.376
tape 2.

00:03.979 --> 00:05.707
Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:06.491 --> 00:11.695
No, I usually

00:13.025 --> 00:37.459
usually had something that I was looking for, or, of course, like if I go up to Yale, I just, you know, whatever they brought, you know, the rare books library brought out, the boxes and boxes, you know, with their Hemingway material, and go through them.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.445
But then when I went to a number of public libraries,

00:41.425 --> 01:05.543
A lot of times it would be specifically, like when I was at Bloomington, and then I'd naturally go to the public library, and then I would, where I would go would be to their short story collections, because I was in, and then I went to Harcourt Grace, and they left me look at their in-house library, and so did what other publishers.

01:05.742 --> 01:13.515
and McGraw Hill had an excellent in-house library that I could spend rainy days, rainy lunch hours in.

01:15.218 --> 01:24.274
So that it's just really, you asked me before about

01:25.250 --> 01:38.050
how a bibliographer proceeded, but really just with access to collections and to following up those footnotes.

01:39.352 --> 01:50.009
But things like newspaper articles, that has to be as much luck as anything else, because there wasn't really a database like we have today that you could... True, true.

01:50.230 --> 01:52.894
So, of course, the marvelous New York Times index

01:53.347 --> 02:03.160
And then, as I say, I had access to some of the Midwest newspaper files, to their morons.

02:03.521 --> 02:10.670
And let's see how else I can explain.

02:10.690 --> 02:20.704
And then, of course, once, something like the date of when he won the Nobel Prize in 1954, or the suicide in 1961.

02:21.055 --> 02:31.845
Then, you know, I would go to the newspaper that I knew would have... That have material on it.

02:31.865 --> 02:36.718
That would have coverage, important coverage on...

02:37.863 --> 02:41.833
Now, do you do any work with a computer in this?

02:41.853 --> 02:43.176
No, I haven't, no.

02:43.597 --> 02:51.737
So you really, I don't know how a computer, if the technology that's available today was available to you then?

02:52.460 --> 02:56.946
You have no idea of the kind of search apparatus that you'd be able to do.

02:57.006 --> 02:58.148
It's unbelievable.

02:58.168 --> 03:00.691
I don't know.

03:00.711 --> 03:12.467
You know, I left McGraw-Hill in 1979, and the next year when my assistant took over as supervisor, why, they planted a computer on their desk.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.853
So I missed it by a fraction.

03:17.735 --> 03:21.640
But I do use it at the... I do a lot of work on this...

03:21.923 --> 03:39.770
at the UMKC Library and at the, where, Library of Congress, where was I just, oh, and at the Nelson Atkins Museum is a lovely library.

03:40.231 --> 03:42.194
And, you know, have to use computers.

03:42.835 --> 03:44.958
And then, of course, the Kansas City Public Library now.

03:45.379 --> 03:47.121
So what kinds of things do you do now?

03:47.943 --> 03:50.226
Are you still doing work, research work?

03:51.033 --> 03:57.179
Oh, still working on my Dutch artist, yes, uh-huh.

03:58.000 --> 03:58.661
Dutch artist?

03:59.001 --> 03:59.982
When did you start this?

04:01.003 --> 04:07.770
Well, I noticed Jerry mentions it back here, and what did we say that was, 1977?

04:07.790 --> 04:16.159
My first trip abroad, and, oh, this is another story, and I guess maybe we shouldn't get into this.

04:16.179 --> 04:20.483
My first trip abroad, when I went to Paris, and then I went to London,

04:20.800 --> 04:24.385
and took a tour at Warwick Castle.

04:25.346 --> 04:28.690
I saw a portrait of a man by Adrian Hanneman.

04:29.591 --> 04:39.444
And Marjorie's always had painted paints, and that was the only, hers were the only paintings I ever saw sign them.

04:39.624 --> 04:44.070
But I'd been going to art museums since I was a teenager.

04:45.732 --> 04:49.677
And I had never heard of him.

04:50.078 --> 04:51.340
What's his name again?

04:52.261 --> 04:53.623
The same last name.

04:53.904 --> 04:54.545
With one N?

04:54.966 --> 04:57.650
First name is A-D-R-I-A-E-N.

04:58.451 --> 04:58.852
Okay.

04:59.012 --> 05:01.115
The Dutch spelling of Adrian.

05:01.255 --> 05:04.360
And his years are 1604 to 1671.

05:06.323 --> 05:09.488
So I once read where everyone

05:09.873 --> 05:12.818
should know another century than their own.

05:13.278 --> 05:18.446
And I have become very familiar with the 17th century.

05:19.227 --> 05:21.591
So I've been on it for a while.

05:21.731 --> 05:23.114
So what are you trying to document?

05:24.395 --> 05:27.060
Now, you may smile.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.124
I am doing a biography of Avian Hanneman.

05:30.265 --> 05:30.765
Oh, you are?

05:30.845 --> 05:32.488
Because there isn't any.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.827
So this will be a biography.

05:34.847 --> 05:37.270
So this will be a biography.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.331
Have you started the writing?

05:38.811 --> 05:39.352
Oh, yes.

05:39.733 --> 05:39.973
Yes.

05:40.353 --> 05:42.596
Yes, I've done the first draft.

05:42.616 --> 05:51.566
And a Dutch art scholar did a catalog of his paintings.

05:51.767 --> 06:00.737
And I've seen his work in old McGraw Hill had a tour

06:01.088 --> 06:08.497
I think it was something like $300 with hotel and plane and food to Russia.

06:09.238 --> 06:14.624
And they had one of his paintings there at the Pushkin in Moscow.

06:14.644 --> 06:17.067
And then, of course, I've seen them.

06:17.087 --> 06:22.454
I've seen them in Scotland and England and many in The Hague and in Belgium.

06:23.455 --> 06:27.400
And then there's one here at the Nelson Atkins Museum.

06:27.599 --> 06:29.242
There's one at Yale.

06:29.302 --> 06:34.350
There's one in the New York Metropolitan.

06:34.370 --> 06:43.845
But the one where a large reproduction hangs over my desk is at the National Gallery in Washington.

06:44.026 --> 06:49.515
And it was bought by Andrew Mellon back in 1937 as the Van Dyke.

06:49.535 --> 06:53.421
And then it was, oh...

06:54.143 --> 07:06.056
Let's see, I just heard he said until it was a good 40 years later, maybe, where it had hung originally in the Hermitage when Catherine the Great bought it.

07:06.616 --> 07:14.285
It had been a Hanneman, and then they changed it to Van Dyck and back and forth, and finally now the National Gallery.

07:14.505 --> 07:22.233
They just issued a beautiful book on their Dutch collection last year, and it's fully credited to Adrian Hanneman.

07:22.614 --> 07:24.015
Now, he's Dutch, you said?

07:24.788 --> 07:48.720
yes uh-huh now is that your background dutch born in the hague uh no so there's no chance that this is a relation no see and then uh no uh our name had the second n and so that uh so it's a name it's it's a name that's the same it's not blood the name uh of course grabbed me and then uh

07:48.987 --> 07:52.772
I wanted to know more about the man and there I was.

07:53.594 --> 08:07.333
I've actually thanked God a number of times that having given me the one project on Hemingway that I wasn't sure that I would ever be lucky enough to find another project that I wanted to

08:07.702 --> 08:36.358
uh really get into uh deeply and uh and this has been and and of course any artist whose work can be confused with uh where uh some of his paintings have been attributed to van dyke you know he has to be pretty good has to be pretty good now how are you how are you finding out details about his life oh uh again um just uh

08:37.047 --> 08:45.062
Again, finding something, finding footnotes, tracking down everything.

08:45.102 --> 08:48.609
I've worked at the Library of Congress several times.

08:49.130 --> 08:55.562
I had told my sister that I may never see a picture of what he looks like,

08:55.964 --> 09:13.288
And then a week later at the New York Public Library in a book of Horace Walpole's, his Anticdotes of Painting, and there was an etching of a self-portrait.

09:13.789 --> 09:18.776
So it, too, is hanging here over my desk.

09:18.836 --> 09:20.518
Do you have a publisher to show it to?

09:21.280 --> 09:21.740
No.

09:22.181 --> 09:23.743
Years ago,

09:23.723 --> 09:33.416
that was 1969 when I first saw it, and Miriam Brokaw at Princeton University Press.

09:33.476 --> 09:44.550
I'm not sure if she's become the director by then or not, but she was much more interested in my doing a book on Adrian Hanneman than on Hemingway.

09:45.131 --> 09:46.373
But no, no.

09:47.794 --> 09:49.056
See, I've worked there.

09:50.133 --> 10:01.173
16 years in-house and 13 years as a freelancer for McGraw Hill under pressure of deadlines and I have just not given myself any at all.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.421
So I'm just... Well, when do you hope to have it done?

10:06.363 --> 10:07.064
Too much.

10:07.224 --> 10:09.529
I haven't given myself a cut-off date.

10:10.571 --> 10:13.035
There isn't any Carlos Baker to tell me

10:13.353 --> 10:42.330
stop stop and consider it complete complete but I am enjoying it oh well it's nice telling you something about it but now have I told you enough are there other questions you have about Hemingway well I think that I want to absorb this because I think we've got two hours on tape which is quite a bit

10:43.087 --> 10:48.074
And so what I want to do is go listen to this and transcribe it.

10:48.835 --> 10:53.482
And I'd like, if it's at all possible, if you could send me some of this material that you have.

10:53.743 --> 10:54.744
I'm glad to.

10:54.764 --> 10:55.005
Absolutely.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.467
I'll put it in the mail this week.

10:56.487 --> 10:58.430
So that would be wonderful to have my address.

10:58.510 --> 11:00.032
And then, you know, we'll talk again.

11:00.518 --> 11:01.359
Very good.

11:01.379 --> 11:05.865
You know, like yourself, I'm not on a strict deadline either.

11:07.127 --> 11:11.653
So this is not going to be done, you know, in two months as you can... Oh, good for you.

11:11.853 --> 11:12.814
Absolutely.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.016
Oh, I can see.

11:14.116 --> 11:17.020
I mean, you did the other books so beautifully.

11:17.100 --> 11:21.946
I can understand if you don't want pressure put on you.

11:21.986 --> 11:24.990
Well, I actually want to see this out in 1999.

11:25.460 --> 11:26.762
Wouldn't that be good?

11:26.902 --> 11:29.827
I plan to get all the writing done within the next year.

11:29.887 --> 11:34.595
Once I start, I do 1,000 words a day.

11:34.615 --> 11:37.801
I require that of myself.

11:38.181 --> 11:40.726
Oh, I think that's marvelous.

11:40.746 --> 11:45.814
And my rule is 1,000 publishable words a day, not just 1,000 words.

11:45.794 --> 11:48.142
But a thousand words I'm happy with, you know?

11:49.166 --> 11:49.306
Uh-huh.

11:49.326 --> 11:51.855
So, of course, I use the computer, which helps a lot.

11:53.621 --> 11:53.782
Oh, yes.

11:53.802 --> 11:54.524
Yes, it would.

11:54.544 --> 11:56.732
But now, if you see something more rusty,

11:56.982 --> 11:58.724
Well, you think I might have misspoke.

11:58.964 --> 12:00.646
Oh, we'll go over this.

12:00.686 --> 12:01.126
Don't worry.

12:01.206 --> 12:03.648
This is not the only time we're going to talk.

12:03.709 --> 12:10.595
We'll have to talk again, and undoubtedly there will be some questions, and then I might want to go over a few things with you.

12:10.875 --> 12:11.957
Oh, very good.

12:11.977 --> 12:12.357
Okay.

12:12.697 --> 12:13.618
Very good.

12:13.638 --> 12:15.800
Well, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.901
Really, I appreciate it.

12:17.262 --> 12:18.863
Well, it's been a pleasure.

12:18.883 --> 12:24.829
I'm very flattered that you were that interested in what I did.

12:25.045 --> 12:39.399
I consider it a big achievement, but since, as I say, since 1981 I really, I think Princeton has only sent me out, forwarded one query from a professor, so I've really been out of touch.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.063
Since 1981?

12:41.195 --> 12:44.819
since we moved back to Kansas City.

12:44.839 --> 12:47.482
And you mean one query meaning like?

12:48.383 --> 12:50.545
Oh, a professor wanted something.

12:51.887 --> 12:54.890
I don't have it at the top of my hand.

12:55.171 --> 13:07.945
But they had forwarded, you know, of course, early on there were a number of letters sent to Princeton that they forwarded to me.

13:08.212 --> 13:15.630
As I say, I have been so much away from it that I think it's been good for me to review all of this.

13:16.592 --> 13:16.893
Great.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.036
Thank you for calling.

13:18.156 --> 13:20.642
Well, thank you for taking the time, and we'll talk again soon.

13:21.123 --> 13:22.226
Oh, very good.

13:22.246 --> 13:23.008
Okay, you take care.

13:23.028 --> 13:24.632
I will, you too.

13:24.652 --> 13:25.173
Okay, thank you.

13:25.614 --> 13:26.035
Bye-bye.
