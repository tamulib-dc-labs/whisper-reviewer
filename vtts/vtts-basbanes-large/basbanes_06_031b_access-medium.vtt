00:05.448 --> 00:15.779
The preservation is handled by the fact of keeping them as cool as can it, and keeping them between the mileage sheets, and keeping them dry.

00:17.061 --> 00:20.865
The other type of security, of course, is theft.

00:21.986 --> 00:25.590
And we mentioned that a couple minutes ago, or a couple minutes ago.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.311
In another context.

00:26.571 --> 00:31.577
In another context, that these things are really not stealable unless you want to look at them in your basement.

00:31.697 --> 00:34.780
Most of the greatest manuscripts, everybody knows where they are.

00:35.063 --> 00:46.577
And so stealing them, you're not going to be able to walk into a store and say, how would you like to buy this great manuscript, the Constitution of the Confederate States of America.

00:46.597 --> 00:49.160
Almost every university knows what it is.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.441
Most dealers know what it is.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.246
And anybody who's not a dealer or a university is not going to buy that thing.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.248
They wouldn't know what the value is.

00:56.268 --> 00:59.372
And therefore, they're almost not saleable.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.055
And therefore, they're not stealable.

01:02.836 --> 01:04.918
But then you do have a Steven Blumberg.

01:05.590 --> 01:09.914
You know the guy out in Iowa who sold 18,000 documents to the FBI?

01:10.575 --> 01:12.717
Oh, okay, no, but were those traceable documents?

01:12.817 --> 01:13.738
Yeah, but he didn't care.

01:13.758 --> 01:15.519
He didn't buy them to sell.

01:15.599 --> 01:17.241
He stored them in a house.

01:17.261 --> 01:22.025
Yeah, there are exceptions of people who just, maybe like just to steal, it's hard to say.

01:22.105 --> 01:32.475
But what I'm hoping is that you have some program that... Oh, well, obviously, even though they're not stealable, we don't leave them out on the coffee table either.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.917
What we have is we have a vault.

01:37.158 --> 01:39.461
It sounds like a football said they're not steelable.

01:39.481 --> 01:40.742
Then I'll tell you about the vault.

01:41.703 --> 01:43.345
Well, I'm glad to hear about the vault.

01:43.365 --> 01:53.317
The vault is a foot thick with steel, a cement with steel in it, and the inside of the vault is lined with pure steel.

01:53.577 --> 01:56.380
Top sides, everything is lined with pure steel.

01:56.421 --> 02:00.285
So even if someone was able to jackhammer through, they would hit the steel

02:00.974 --> 02:03.297
shell inside the vault.

02:04.239 --> 02:13.391
And inside the vault, if anybody was able to get inside the vault, there are several alarm systems which would go off saying someone's inside the vault.

02:13.411 --> 02:15.414
There are alarm systems outside the vault, too.

02:15.434 --> 02:17.217
Is it a walk-in kind of vault?

02:17.397 --> 02:17.597
Yeah.

02:17.898 --> 02:21.743
10 feet by 30 feet by... 10 feet tall, 30 feet tall.

02:22.965 --> 02:26.730
But once you get inside, the alarms must have gone off several times.

02:27.130 --> 02:29.654
From the outside of the vault, near the vault, and inside the vault.

02:29.674 --> 02:30.054
Security's good.

02:30.074 --> 02:30.475
Security's good.

02:30.725 --> 02:31.025
Yeah.

02:31.747 --> 02:37.275
And inside the vault, once you get inside the vault, the manuscripts aren't safes inside the vault.

02:37.295 --> 02:41.741
So once you get in, you have to be a safe tracker, even after you get in this vault.

02:41.882 --> 02:44.065
That's what I wanted to hear.

02:44.606 --> 02:46.368
That's when they're in the vault.

02:46.408 --> 02:56.243
Now, when they're in the museums on exhibit, some of them are placed in a regular safe, like a jeweler's safe.

02:56.695 --> 03:21.167
uh overnight and some of them are just left in the cases and but we do have what's called security alarm system which is a company that has a system has uh sensors of various types around and if anybody's in the building after the computer goes it will bring up the uh police station and the police will be there

03:27.526 --> 03:35.295
He's still in the process of forming what he wants to do.

03:35.315 --> 03:40.322
He's got another 30, 40 years to figure out.

03:40.342 --> 03:41.843
I think he has to get four children.

03:41.863 --> 03:42.004
Mm-hmm.

03:42.024 --> 03:43.826
We just married one off on Sunday.

03:43.846 --> 03:46.349
We're just waiting for weddings.

03:46.369 --> 03:53.558
And we exhibited the wedding march and the procession.

03:53.578 --> 03:54.018
In other words.

03:54.419 --> 03:56.221
You have a manuscript.

03:56.341 --> 03:57.162
Exactly.

03:57.547 --> 03:59.449
This is by who?

03:59.469 --> 04:06.595
By, if you'll notice, right here, Mendelssohn and Bodnar.

04:06.615 --> 04:16.084
And the photographer is coming today to take a picture of the manuscripts, and he's going to superimpose the picture.

04:16.164 --> 04:16.505
That's great.

04:16.645 --> 04:18.006
That's really great.

04:18.026 --> 04:20.528
You have to be very proud of him.

04:21.269 --> 04:22.090
I really am.

04:22.110 --> 04:22.530
I know.

04:22.550 --> 04:25.613
He has a lot of creativity and a lot of vision.

04:26.369 --> 04:30.933
I do.

04:31.434 --> 04:35.678
But I think that he could do it if he had anything he could think.

04:35.698 --> 04:38.120
Because you'd be using your energies elsewhere.

04:38.140 --> 04:41.463
Did you ever think that it was kind of quixotic?

04:41.844 --> 04:42.764
You did.

04:43.545 --> 04:45.047
You thought that, my God, what are we doing?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.408
A million manuscripts.

04:46.628 --> 04:53.895
But at the same time, I had this bearing that people can choose what they want to do with their lives.

04:54.196 --> 05:06.268
Some people travel and other people collect clothes, paintings or whatever, and this is what we do.

05:06.328 --> 05:07.770
Which of your children was married?

05:08.030 --> 05:08.971
I think I'll use them.

05:09.131 --> 05:09.752
My daughter, Cheryl.

05:09.772 --> 05:13.556
How do we spell that?

05:14.436 --> 05:15.498
C-H-E-R-Y-L.

05:15.658 --> 05:20.963
And she was married on Saturday on August 4th.

05:21.584 --> 05:22.866
At the library.

05:22.926 --> 05:24.909
She was married on the lawn here.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.052
And then we went over to the library.

05:27.112 --> 05:30.438
And we had an incredible place.

05:30.518 --> 05:32.901
The best wedding I've ever been to.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.484
It just occurred.

05:34.544 --> 05:37.448
You would still be recovering from that.

05:37.468 --> 05:38.911
I am still high from it.

05:38.931 --> 05:39.792
It was so wonderful.

05:39.812 --> 05:41.775
And this is the first of your children that you married?

05:41.795 --> 05:45.060
This is the third child that we have married in the same manner.

05:45.665 --> 05:47.868
We get better and better at it.

05:47.888 --> 05:49.530
Have you exhibited the wedding watch?

05:49.570 --> 05:51.652
No, this is the first time we've done it.

05:51.672 --> 05:52.874
Have you exhibited other things?

05:52.994 --> 05:58.300
That was a stroke of inspiration, really, wasn't it?

05:58.600 --> 05:59.542
I think so.

05:59.602 --> 06:00.943
That's a great story.

06:03.466 --> 06:08.372
I have really one question to ask, and then maybe if you could show us a few things.

06:08.532 --> 06:14.119
I guess, and it's a philosophical kind of question, but I guess do you feel that you're

06:14.825 --> 06:41.254
you're building your legacy oh that's one word yeah yeah was this ever paramount in your thoughts or was it really were you too kind of uh preoccupied with getting all this stuff no i was never preoccupied at all no well i'm not sure about that i don't have to think about that well but but i mean the thought that you this is an opportunity to create to

06:41.690 --> 07:11.460
leave something to build something meaningful significant if you read this whatever it is i have your credo or whatever you want to call it when i was and this is it says the same thing i guess but when i was a kid i remember i knew who simon bolivar was i knew who the the quest for the indies i knew who fleming in the back scene i knew all of these things mainly out of comic books but i knew them you know a classic comic or whatever and

07:12.031 --> 07:16.596
When we were fairly young, and our kids were young, they didn't seem to know.

07:16.616 --> 07:18.979
We'd ask them, who is Simone Bolivar?

07:19.860 --> 07:22.783
We'd mention a few names, and they didn't know anybody.

07:23.123 --> 07:24.384
I mean, nothing about history.

07:24.465 --> 07:27.348
All they knew was rock and roll stars, it seemed, or whatever.

07:27.388 --> 07:30.051
Even though our kids are not rough kids.

07:30.111 --> 07:34.956
No, it's true, because education has become practice, and when the kids are in a country.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.759
Yeah, right.

07:37.779 --> 07:41.363
And they seem to have, as I say now, no goals.

07:41.630 --> 07:45.135
They seem to have no hope, pride for the teacher, nothing.

07:45.155 --> 07:47.157
They don't care what they're going to be when they grow up.

07:47.397 --> 07:48.619
You know, what do you got me to grow up?

07:48.679 --> 07:49.580
I don't know.

07:49.620 --> 07:51.803
Whatever happens, you know, it'll fall on me.

07:52.925 --> 07:57.931
And this disturbed me because I think the world is heading the wrong way.

07:57.971 --> 08:06.202
I thought I could see the world heading towards the wrong way, I guess.

08:08.465 --> 08:10.928
When people have goals and a sense of purpose,

08:11.330 --> 08:16.717
Then I think we're advancing and we have something to look forward to and people will be happier.

08:17.057 --> 08:18.479
I don't think these kids are going to be happy.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.523
I think they're going to be miserable when they grow up because they have no goals.

08:21.563 --> 08:23.987
They have nothing to look forward to.

08:24.527 --> 08:27.091
And that's essentially why we started the library.

08:27.471 --> 08:31.797
It's because we wanted, our first idea was to attack the kids.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.721
But we realized that we can't, that's not going to be easy.

08:34.741 --> 08:35.682
We're going to have to do it.

08:35.742 --> 08:37.905
The kids are going to have to sort of come with the adults.

08:37.925 --> 08:40.408
The adults are going to have to see it and the kids are going to have to come slowly.

08:40.844 --> 08:56.040
Eventually, when we have the number of exhibit halls we want, then we're going to try to pull in the schools by, as I mentioned to you before, we're going to perhaps have, well, we'll certainly have exhibits.

08:56.180 --> 09:04.509
Schools will come by buses, which they do anyway now, but we will have contests where the kids will write out something, a little essay.

09:04.609 --> 09:05.390
Stimulating.

09:05.430 --> 09:06.531
Yeah.

09:06.747 --> 09:17.938
Hopefully they'll use the library, and they will look into history, look into science, look into literature, and go back to the... I hope I'm proud that you have Mr. Teacher in you, actually.

09:18.059 --> 09:26.407
I think Jill Maddalena said something that I've been thinking about for a long time, last time we saw him.

09:26.547 --> 09:30.011
He said, kids, they're not acceptable anymore, but they didn't work.

09:30.151 --> 09:31.252
They're acceptable by video.

09:31.913 --> 09:32.333
True.

09:33.055 --> 09:42.711
And he suggested that we take our show, think up or not, and have our video format.

09:42.751 --> 09:43.852
When we'll ever do that.

09:45.695 --> 09:48.400
I think I've pretty well covered it.

09:48.460 --> 10:00.379
You know, what we might want to do is just give you a little clue of the house here, because we do use, we do have some books online, and the books are used to research documents.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.449
And they're not rare books.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.631
They're just reference books.

10:03.651 --> 10:04.992
And so we could show that.

10:05.012 --> 10:06.113
Let's do it.

10:06.294 --> 10:06.434
What?

10:06.514 --> 10:07.094
Edward, let's do it.

10:07.114 --> 10:07.255
Yeah.

10:07.275 --> 10:08.536
Let's go take a picture.

10:09.657 --> 10:11.459
There's a private research library.

10:11.499 --> 10:12.200
Three libraries.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.321
Well, this is.

10:13.561 --> 10:14.923
No one gets to see this one.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.204
I don't know.

10:16.224 --> 10:16.805
Some people do it.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.306
This is a gorgeous house one.

10:18.346 --> 10:19.367
Thank you.

10:19.387 --> 10:21.850
Now, is this the house that you built?

10:21.870 --> 10:22.931
We built most of it.

10:23.251 --> 10:25.894
It was a private research library.

10:27.616 --> 10:29.438
Here's my way.

10:31.072 --> 10:34.957
This is a, wow.

10:34.977 --> 10:44.108
When I come down whenever I have a document, I'll come down and I'll go in various sections and I'll go through the sections of some book that will... And what do you call this room?

10:44.689 --> 10:47.472
This is our own private library.

10:49.275 --> 10:52.478
We're about to build a small library adjacent to our house.

10:52.499 --> 10:53.460
Oh, very nice.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.382
And we have a small library.

10:55.402 --> 10:56.944
Connie, hold your breath on this.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.157
Hold your breath.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.743
Do you mind if I take a picture of you and your wife in here?

11:05.964 --> 11:07.847
Oh, no.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.990
The Proclamation of Statehood of California.

11:10.430 --> 11:11.132
That's a zero.

11:11.152 --> 11:15.218
Do you have the original?

11:15.618 --> 11:16.660
Yeah.

11:17.181 --> 11:19.244
The Proclamation of Statehood of California.

11:19.584 --> 11:22.528
Now, why isn't California on that?

11:22.548 --> 11:23.590
That's a good question.

11:24.042 --> 11:26.664
If they did, it would probably be soggy at the moment.

11:27.365 --> 11:28.586
What was the year on it?

11:28.606 --> 11:28.886
1849?

11:28.906 --> 11:34.952
Yeah, 1849.

11:35.012 --> 11:41.137
I'm delighted that it's here in the same place, but you wonder why it's not in Sacramento or wherever.

11:41.197 --> 11:42.959
That's a good question.

11:44.380 --> 11:47.403
I didn't have the answer to that.

11:47.423 --> 11:52.227
They probably have a printed copy.

11:52.831 --> 12:07.204
How would you describe the architecture of this house?

12:08.225 --> 12:21.977
Italian Mediterranean or Mediterranean?

12:22.666 --> 12:28.511
What's the style of your house?

12:28.531 --> 12:29.452
Mallorca.

12:29.472 --> 12:30.052
Mallorca?

12:30.073 --> 12:34.276
I don't know, I've never heard of Mallorca.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.138
Sure, Mallorca is an island.

12:37.579 --> 12:40.261
Oh, who knows.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.382
It's beautiful.

12:41.402 --> 12:47.228
It's actually rebuilt, this part, and we tried to match it to the original part.

12:47.248 --> 12:51.171
I don't know, it seems eight beams, magnificent.

12:51.539 --> 12:55.242
And the original house is how old?

12:55.262 --> 12:56.744
The original house is 1915.

12:56.764 --> 13:00.407
This edition is 1978, I would guess.

13:02.148 --> 13:10.035
And then the dining room, which you haven't seen, is 1982.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.658
And who owned the original house?

13:12.678 --> 13:13.598
There's only been four owners.

13:13.678 --> 13:19.463
Prior to last, there was the owner of Western Petro Savings and Loans.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.225
And then there was a general...

13:21.340 --> 13:22.682
The general.

13:22.983 --> 13:30.095
And then part of that, the Coleman family.

13:30.135 --> 13:34.101
So it probably would have been the Colemans who built it then?

13:34.302 --> 13:40.812
Yes, I believe it was the Colemans who built it.

13:40.832 --> 13:41.033
Wow.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.477
How old was it around?

13:45.180 --> 13:46.622
About three acres.

13:49.842 --> 13:52.365
What are the dimensions of this one?

13:52.466 --> 13:56.791
It's like, everybody, 16, I believe.

13:56.992 --> 14:00.456
That's not what you want, right?

14:00.476 --> 14:00.656
Yeah.

14:00.737 --> 14:04.822
And it's 16 feet tall, I believe.

14:05.042 --> 14:09.448
There must be a great feeling, Mr. Simmons, and Scooter Vimler.

14:09.468 --> 14:11.271
I gather that's an original Scooter Vimler.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.134
No, no, he's a Christian.

14:14.195 --> 14:16.458
I've got a flex thing, but I don't know.

14:17.138 --> 14:19.782
As you see, I flex down these things.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.822
And the wood is a little bit old.

14:21.842 --> 14:24.205
That's just right out of the lumber yard.

14:29.753 --> 14:37.704
When I collect certain things like bronze, I look used to rather than authentic authorization.

14:37.724 --> 14:43.131
The Metropolitan, I think, said, and don't quote me, because when I quote something, it's just what other people quote me.

14:43.191 --> 14:47.777
Some of the Metropolitan ones said that they felt that

14:48.466 --> 14:52.502
at least 50% of all of their paintings are for Jews.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.922
What was it?

14:54.942 --> 14:57.385
50% are all appropriate, but they said they are.

14:57.626 --> 15:01.652
Even though they paid millions of dollars for them, they are such good works, they're worth it.

15:01.752 --> 15:02.353
That's right.

15:02.373 --> 15:06.339
I mean, if Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, some of them know that.

15:06.459 --> 15:08.221
Yeah, right, some of them know that.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.002
That's right, exactly.

15:09.022 --> 15:10.424
Or somebody paid, even though he copied it.

15:10.445 --> 15:10.845
That's right.

15:10.865 --> 15:13.629
Manuscripts are different, but on the bronze and whatever else you have.

15:14.130 --> 15:19.798
If I think it's really a fine work, and I think I can tell them, then that's fine with me.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.100
I don't mind if it's a copy.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.422
The passion is tremendous.

15:22.402 --> 15:42.167
Yeah, the manuscript, on the other hand, that's... I hate to think of a manuscript that was... That would not only... And I'm sure there's at least one or two percent... Yeah, I think it's very, very low.

15:42.187 --> 15:44.950
It's extremely difficult to go into manuscripts.

15:45.453 --> 16:00.049
Not only do you have to get the right paper, the old paper, which a collector can tell very quickly just by being with it, working with old ink, which is what you can tell very simply, you have to have that old ink on the old paper.

16:00.129 --> 16:11.882
And that's not easy, because if you find old ink in old paper, and you try to write a copy of manuscript, the ink will spider out because the paper's old, and therefore you can't copy.

16:12.284 --> 16:15.087
People can still do it, though.

16:15.387 --> 16:22.475
Oh, they can do it if they use chemicals to fix the ink and paper, but then it's easily to detect it.

16:22.495 --> 16:41.616
We have a black light, it's called, which we can shine on, and some chemicals will fluoresce, and old ink and old paper do not have those same chemicals, so it won't fluoresce, and so you just shine, put it under a black light, and if you see any fluorescence in it, you know some of these.

16:41.731 --> 16:45.057
Well, would you have taken a shot at the Hitlers, the alleged Hitlers?

16:45.077 --> 16:57.699
Oh, I would have loved—well, they used—Randell used—there's only three or four speeches known that I love Hitlers, and he used a manuscript we had to— You have a Hitlers?

16:57.799 --> 16:59.863
We have two of the four speeches.

17:00.063 --> 17:02.187
The National Archives has two, and we have two.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.714
And Rendell used ours to disauthenticate.

17:05.794 --> 17:08.437
He was the one who said, no, they're no good.

17:08.457 --> 17:09.839
Yeah, that kind of made his name.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.841
How about Glenn Hoffman?

17:10.861 --> 17:12.203
Did he ever approach you?

17:12.303 --> 17:14.926
No, I didn't know Hoffman.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.130
I never did know Hoffman, which was surprising.

17:17.150 --> 17:26.082
And his forgeries are tough, because even though he used this fixative, so you can see it when you put a...

17:26.652 --> 17:28.574
with black light on it.

17:29.375 --> 17:41.888
He also used an ink... He used a fixative that didn't fluoresce in some cases, but it did make the ink ball up into tiny little microscopic spots.

17:43.270 --> 17:49.497
And it sounds like he was looking under high power to determine whether these spots are there, but it's not that easy.

17:51.659 --> 17:55.343
Rendell has some photos, and you say, well, okay, look, here's a...

17:55.424 --> 17:58.087
You tell me where those spots are on this photo.

17:58.127 --> 18:02.191
Do you become a handwriting expert?

18:03.492 --> 18:07.135
Just by experience, you have to become a handwriting expert.

18:07.516 --> 18:13.882
Not only is it paper and ink, and the combination of paper and ink, but then of course you have to know how the guy made his letters.

18:14.282 --> 18:19.047
Every single letter has to be similar to what Henry VIII did.

18:19.067 --> 18:22.090
But they changed in different parts of their life.

18:22.492 --> 18:27.037
So you have to look at the date and a date of a similar letter and compare them.

18:27.057 --> 18:32.444
Not only just the letters, but every combination of two letters meets in a certain way.

18:32.464 --> 18:34.526
So you're not talking about 26 things.

18:34.546 --> 18:44.698
You're talking about 26, time is 26, different combinations that someone has to know his head and has to be able to write quickly while he's thinking of this hundreds of different combinations.

18:44.738 --> 18:45.639
And you can practice.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.441
Well, it's almost impossible to do it.

18:47.481 --> 18:48.863
But you have a feel, you know it.

18:49.584 --> 18:50.625
You can pretty much...

18:50.774 --> 19:00.291
Because if someone tries to go write slow, think of what the combination should look like and then write it slow, you will see where the pen stopped, for example.

19:00.832 --> 19:06.623
You also can tell if he's writing slow, because when they write fast, the lines get

19:06.957 --> 19:08.439
thin and thick and so forth.

19:08.819 --> 19:12.263
And if the lines are even all the way along, you know the guy's copying.

19:12.483 --> 19:15.327
That's amazing.

19:15.787 --> 19:24.297
And then, the ultimate thing, you have to know what the guy would have wrote, what content he would have put in there.

19:24.317 --> 19:28.021
That's what blew the Hitler Diaries away, I think.

19:28.382 --> 19:30.724
I mean, the chemistry was wrong, the table was wrong.

19:30.784 --> 19:33.167
The fibers in the binding was huge.

19:33.670 --> 19:39.257
What is the oldest manuscript that you have, would you say?

19:39.277 --> 19:47.266
Well, we have, as you'll see when we go down, in the downtown museum, we have 4,000 B.C.

19:47.627 --> 19:56.077
documents and so forth, clay tablets with Sumerian writings and so forth.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.461
The one that I would say, in my estimation, is the oldest.

19:59.861 --> 20:02.985
Now, I'm more interested in the important documents.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.804
What's the oldest important document?

20:04.824 --> 20:15.878
And the oldest one that we have is a document of Pope Lucius III from 1183, I believe it is, which is quite a few years ago.

20:15.898 --> 20:17.440
800 years?

20:18.121 --> 20:18.822
Yes, right.

20:18.842 --> 20:26.071
And this was a letter proclaiming the sacred duty of the Knights of Holy Crusade.

20:26.232 --> 20:26.492
Wow.

20:26.810 --> 20:54.792
the knights on that's that's amazing that stuff is out there i think that's my favorite document because if you find a document from the 1100s it's almost impossible you don't they're they come up once every 10 years but to find one where you're where the pope is initiating the holy crusades that's unbelievable where'd you pay for that oh gosh i don't even remember you must have an idea i don't remember

20:55.025 --> 20:59.069
Not real big bucks, not what it's worth.

20:59.109 --> 21:01.432
Well, that's the smart buyer.

21:01.492 --> 21:03.815
But it wasn't small, but it wasn't.

21:03.835 --> 21:04.215
Good.

21:04.235 --> 21:05.396
And you're thrilled to have it.

21:05.436 --> 21:06.538
Oh, absolutely.

21:06.578 --> 21:16.308
In fact, four times in my life have I ever written anybody that I have purchased a document and actually formally thanked them for the privilege of letting me buy it.

21:16.328 --> 21:17.289
And that was one of them.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.852
Because I thought it was horror and excessive.

21:20.453 --> 21:21.814
It was a special, special thing.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.496
And to whom did you write that letter?

21:23.611 --> 21:29.059
I forget it.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.161
What else do we wrote it?

21:30.201 --> 21:31.903
Well, we got the Confederate Constitution.

21:31.923 --> 21:32.504
We wrote it.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.187
You got the Confederate Constitution.

21:34.207 --> 21:35.028
Yes.

21:35.629 --> 21:43.781
That one was the one where we have the most inner feeling on because this was in the University of Georgia.

21:44.301 --> 21:48.528
It had been there for 100 years, and everybody could see it, who was down south.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.492
And all of a sudden, walked in the

21:52.062 --> 21:58.892
Supreme Court Justice of the State of Georgia, and says, I'm afraid my family would like our Constitution back.

22:00.033 --> 22:01.756
And they said, what do you mean your Constitution?

22:01.996 --> 22:03.378
And he says, what can you file?

22:03.398 --> 22:04.199
It's only on loan.

22:04.219 --> 22:06.422
It's been on loan for 100 years from our family.

22:06.462 --> 22:09.126
What was the name of the family?

22:10.969 --> 22:11.650
I'll check it out.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.412
I'm wondering where I would check that out.

22:14.414 --> 22:15.916
I'd have to look it up.

22:18.339 --> 22:19.180
TRR somebody.

22:19.200 --> 22:19.861
OK, forget it.

22:20.723 --> 22:21.023
Yeah.

22:21.830 --> 22:25.554
At any rate, so they said, well, you know, why do you want it back?

22:25.654 --> 22:26.935
And the guy said, we need the money.

22:27.356 --> 22:32.061
And they said, well, let us buy it somehow, and we'll try to raise the money.

22:32.081 --> 22:35.704
And they tried, and no one would donate because it's not raised.

22:35.724 --> 22:37.927
Why should they donate to buy it?

22:37.947 --> 22:39.108
Because the university already owns it.

22:39.148 --> 22:39.528
They must.

22:39.548 --> 22:40.509
It's been there for 100 years.

22:40.530 --> 22:41.571
They couldn't raise the money.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.452
They couldn't sell it.

22:43.553 --> 22:44.674
I mean, they couldn't raise the money.

22:44.694 --> 22:48.698
And so they decided they would have to somehow sell it.

22:49.471 --> 23:05.995
Actually, what happened was they decided to ask all the book dealers if they would somehow donate, or find people to donate, and that's how I learned from a book dealer saying, gee, they're looking for donations for this document, and here it is, and oh, my God, that's unbelievable.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.858
Never occurred you to donate it?

23:08.319 --> 23:10.422
Oh, no, I didn't think about donating.

23:10.482 --> 23:13.326
I was just going to tell them, listen, why not sell it?

23:13.406 --> 23:16.010
And we will exhibit it every so many years.

23:16.070 --> 23:17.352
Wouldn't you buy it?

23:17.551 --> 23:20.296
This was about 10 years ago, I think.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.041
You started about 78, 79 is what you said.

23:23.061 --> 23:23.663
Right, 78, 79.

23:23.683 --> 23:31.898
Oh, well, maybe— But it never did occur to you to say, well, why don't I, in the magnanimity of my soul, give this to the state of Georgia?

23:32.038 --> 23:32.860
No, not—

23:33.177 --> 23:34.058
Anywhere near that.

23:34.158 --> 23:37.381
I am not that type of a philanthropist.

23:37.401 --> 23:39.183
So I sent a message.

23:39.303 --> 23:40.064
Oh, absolutely.

23:40.404 --> 23:41.385
You bet I am.

23:41.425 --> 23:44.127
We made special cases for it and everything.

23:44.148 --> 23:45.449
So you struck a deal with the state?

23:46.390 --> 23:46.950
Not with the state.

23:46.970 --> 23:47.551
With the family.

23:47.731 --> 23:48.972
The family still owned it.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.455
And they wanted to sell it to the university.

23:51.695 --> 23:58.922
And they said, could you wait and see if we could still sell it, raise the money?

23:59.482 --> 24:02.425
And if not, we will let you buy it.

24:02.725 --> 24:08.115
And they weren't able to, so they informed us they would go ahead and sell it to us.

24:08.575 --> 24:09.737
That must be a public figure.

24:09.757 --> 24:12.182
Could you tell me what your case was?

24:12.242 --> 24:15.448
No, no, it wasn't public, unfortunately.

24:15.468 --> 24:18.453
At some price I can tell, but most I'd rather not.

24:18.914 --> 24:19.936
You don't mind my asking.

24:20.677 --> 24:24.143
At that time it was in six figures is all I could say to it.

24:24.325 --> 24:25.707
High, middle, low?

24:25.947 --> 24:27.869
Yeah, I forget.

24:28.170 --> 24:28.750
It's okay.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.394
The bringing prices, believe it or not, takes away from me.

24:31.774 --> 24:36.800
I want to ask you a question, but it is incumbent upon me every once in a while to ask us to get a feel for where we are.

24:37.081 --> 24:39.764
You can do that through some of these dealers.

24:39.784 --> 24:43.088
You can get prices very quickly.

24:43.488 --> 24:53.100
What they did was they hired the president of the American Manuscript Society to come to Georgia to pick it up.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.247
and to bring it out to Santa Barbara.

24:56.968 --> 25:14.025
And here, so this president of the manuscript side went there, he handed in a briefcase that was tied to his wrist, I don't know if it was a regular police thing, and he came out on the plane with his briefcase tied to his wrist, and he comes off the plane, we met him at the plane, because they weren't gonna mail it, they wanted to deliver it personally.

25:14.766 --> 25:21.332
And that was, at that time was the one I had the great, I mean, because it was such a buildup, you know.

25:21.565 --> 25:31.138
And I was absolutely dizzy when he was coming off thinking that here's the original Constitution of the United States of America.

25:31.338 --> 25:32.119
And I was very dizzy.

25:32.159 --> 25:34.302
In fact, I was dizzy for several days after that.

25:35.603 --> 25:37.906
How do you suppose it would have felt if you lived in Boston?

25:38.828 --> 25:42.092
California was part of the Union.

25:42.112 --> 25:44.595
Yeah, but it's kind of out here.

25:44.795 --> 25:46.037
It's really not.

25:46.540 --> 25:50.144
That would be a problem.

25:50.204 --> 25:52.827
That would be a problem, yes.

25:52.967 --> 25:57.532
I think it would be.

25:57.872 --> 25:58.453
I don't know.

25:59.053 --> 26:00.915
The Athenaeum figures in a great story.

26:02.077 --> 26:03.358
The Washington Coat of Arms.

26:03.638 --> 26:06.481
It happens to be the Stars and Strikes.

26:07.322 --> 26:08.243
You should look into that.

26:08.343 --> 26:12.868
That's kind of true, yes.

26:13.810 --> 26:15.172
That's how it happened.

26:15.312 --> 26:16.834
That's how the flag was.

26:17.214 --> 26:19.336
In fact, she looked at his book plate.

26:19.356 --> 26:20.898
Yes, which had his coat of arms on it.

26:20.918 --> 26:21.919
Which had his coat of arms.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.021
From England.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.502
English coat of arms.

26:24.522 --> 26:29.268
And from that she fashioned the American flag.

26:29.809 --> 26:39.700
Actually, you know, I am a little nervous about when people say that, my God, let's not let it out of Boston and let it go to England.

26:40.996 --> 26:44.781
Fairly soon I think we're going to be one world, finally.

26:44.861 --> 26:52.430
I hate to see these boundaries saying this occurred in Boston, so let's keep in Boston.

26:52.450 --> 26:53.511
How do you get around that?

26:54.412 --> 27:01.440
As an example, Santa Barbara was originally Spanish, because Spain owned all of them.

27:01.480 --> 27:06.026
Especially in 1493, they owned all of both Americas.

27:06.587 --> 27:10.311
England got in and France got in there, but definitely

27:10.578 --> 27:18.266
When Juniper Serra came up and finally colonized California, he was Spanish.

27:18.806 --> 27:23.551
I mean, it was under the Spanish crown, and the king ruled California, the Spanish king.

27:24.131 --> 27:28.936
And so let's say Juniper Serra, who was the father of California, wrote a letter.

27:28.976 --> 27:39.927
Now the question is, unless he wrote it in Santa Barbara, I don't know what you put it, or in San Francisco or in Los Angeles, whatever, the question is, is that a

27:40.143 --> 27:43.588
Let's say it wrote in San Francisco.

27:43.608 --> 27:46.372
Is that a document that should stay in San Francisco?

27:47.734 --> 27:50.478
Or is it okay if that document remains in California?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.483
Or should it go back to Spain?

27:53.503 --> 28:01.054
Or, since it's after 1820, should it go to Mexico?

28:01.094 --> 28:09.627
Because Mexico declared themselves independent of Spain, and therefore California was really Mexican all along,

28:09.809 --> 28:11.653
Mexico was part of Spain at the time.

28:12.034 --> 28:14.820
So is that letter Spanish, or is it Mexican?

28:15.241 --> 28:19.590
Or, since the United States took over California in the 1840s, is it American?

28:19.630 --> 28:23.498
Or is it San Franciscan?

28:23.731 --> 28:27.335
Or is it California, the state of California?

28:27.396 --> 28:30.539
So, when does every bit of chauvinism move, in other words?

28:30.559 --> 28:30.860
Exactly.

28:30.980 --> 28:45.298
Or the Catholic churches, because he was first and foremost... So you get into a very difficult situation there, and I think if the Iceland government wants a Uniprocerra document, good for them.

28:45.338 --> 28:46.279
They can afford it.

28:46.630 --> 28:48.833
That's fine, but that now will give you a lot of it.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.416
If you mention that in the book, you'll get a lot of it, too.

28:51.557 --> 28:51.957
I will.

28:51.977 --> 28:54.360
I got a case with the Brooklyn Manuscript, Left England.

28:54.881 --> 28:57.945
That's the only Anglo-Saxon document in North America.

28:57.965 --> 28:58.826
Way of shaggy.

28:58.927 --> 29:00.449
Is that right?

29:00.549 --> 29:01.089
That's interesting.

29:01.150 --> 29:03.873
I've watched, I've tried to get a couple of Anglo-Saxons.

29:03.913 --> 29:07.017
There's been four or five that have come up to say anything.

29:07.037 --> 29:07.778
They're always the last.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.321
It's always, this is your last chance.

29:09.441 --> 29:10.222
Oh, it is.

29:10.242 --> 29:11.784
But the Brooklyn is a shaggy.

29:11.804 --> 29:16.350
There's a few scraps around that have some of the Anglo-Saxons.

29:16.516 --> 29:18.238
I've held this book.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.580
Oh, you mean a printed annual time?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.204
No, a manuscript.

29:22.224 --> 29:22.645
A manuscript.

29:22.665 --> 29:23.706
It's pre-conquest.

29:23.726 --> 29:24.407
It's pre-conquest.

29:24.427 --> 29:25.989
That's interesting, the whole book.

29:26.570 --> 29:28.192
Well, it's quite a scandal.

29:28.272 --> 29:35.443
If you're familiar with Ed Wolfe's book on Rosenbach, there's plenty to back it out.

29:35.963 --> 29:38.246
Mr. Scheide is one of my friends.

29:38.266 --> 29:43.654
You're in company with William Scheide, who's the only private owner of the Google Word Bible in the world.

29:43.938 --> 30:00.897
How many interviews have you done?

30:01.097 --> 30:01.758
Not many.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.983
For local press, probably?

30:06.003 --> 30:06.323
No.

30:07.084 --> 30:09.827
We've been in the...

30:09.875 --> 30:10.997
Let's see.

30:11.357 --> 30:12.258
Marsha, where?

30:12.278 --> 30:15.744
We've got to go look.

30:15.764 --> 30:19.068
I couldn't have shot the picture if it was on, because you can't see.

30:19.088 --> 30:23.395
Some of the interviews we've had, not local, but just hold it very carefully.

30:23.735 --> 30:24.917
Oh, there's one thing.

30:25.017 --> 30:31.927
Rendell, you know, every time we're in Rendell, it seems to be a commissure magazine.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.351
Well, commissure?

30:35.012 --> 30:35.192
No.

30:36.133 --> 30:37.435
Oh, the Westways magazine.

30:38.123 --> 30:42.549
Westlake, which is only in western United States, had a little amount of forms.

30:42.829 --> 30:52.080
David is kind of obsessive about any... David's an obsessive person about any interest that he has.

30:52.201 --> 30:58.448
When we got married, he was a coin collector and spent part of our honeymoon going to the back of corn.

30:58.468 --> 31:03.535
It wasn't my idea of how it spent the honeymoon, but believe me.

31:03.555 --> 31:04.856
But that's good to show you.

31:05.437 --> 31:07.860
That is obsession channeled productively.

31:08.228 --> 31:09.550
Yes, always.

31:10.251 --> 31:12.534
This is a very productive obsession.

31:12.634 --> 31:13.676
Yes, it is.

31:13.796 --> 31:14.277
That's why.

31:14.297 --> 31:17.041
That's another theme in my book.

31:17.061 --> 31:20.586
You know, I mean, we can have obsessed people who are obsessed.

31:20.766 --> 31:24.391
But there are those who take the obsession and do something magnificent.

31:24.411 --> 31:25.273
Yeah.

31:25.293 --> 31:27.175
I think that's true.

31:27.316 --> 31:30.921
I haven't seen too many people who have been obsessed.

31:30.941 --> 31:32.243
I haven't seen any.

31:32.263 --> 31:36.649
I also have not known very many people who can focus very much.

31:37.692 --> 31:48.714
Do you think his training as a mathematician?

31:48.794 --> 31:55.146
When I first married him, I had to learn how to argue all over again.

31:56.489 --> 32:00.156
When you think about it, we all have family patterns.

32:00.355 --> 32:03.019
And you learn how to argue based on what you hear.

32:03.499 --> 32:04.681
And suddenly you marry a man.

32:04.761 --> 32:06.283
Well, that's not logical.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.346
Where'd you get that from?

32:09.888 --> 32:11.411
Everything has to be very analytical.

32:11.491 --> 32:13.113
Yeah, so I learn.

32:13.313 --> 32:14.054
Well, I can switch.

32:14.155 --> 32:14.936
I'm a switch hitter.

32:15.016 --> 32:21.044
I can argue logically or I can get emotional.

32:21.505 --> 32:22.426
Well, look at the basics.

32:22.446 --> 32:28.675
You could probably take the toughest person and be able to...

32:29.617 --> 32:30.338
Okay.

32:30.718 --> 32:34.042
Your wife just said you think that you're kind of obsessive.

32:34.102 --> 32:34.943
Do you agree with that?

32:34.963 --> 32:35.383
Oh, yes.

32:35.403 --> 32:36.985
You have to be obsessive, I think.

32:37.005 --> 32:39.548
Otherwise, it doesn't work.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.009
So this is an obsession?

32:41.790 --> 32:43.012
Yeah.

32:43.032 --> 32:44.053
Is that bad?

32:44.573 --> 32:46.235
No, it's wonderful.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.336
It goes back to my title.

32:48.197 --> 32:48.578
Oh, yes.

32:48.738 --> 32:50.820
It's productive obsession, by the way.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.103
I don't think anybody's not obsessive.

32:53.123 --> 32:53.904
It's successful.

32:54.644 --> 32:55.185
You have to be...

32:55.553 --> 33:06.323
That's my opinion, of course, but I think you have to be as obsessed with something in order to be a super success for that.

33:06.343 --> 33:11.167
So that means that success is the product of obsession.

33:11.848 --> 33:13.730
This is Galileo.

33:13.790 --> 33:19.095
His name is Galileo.

33:19.115 --> 33:20.656
The first name is Galilei.

33:21.557 --> 33:23.839
And here he is announcing the completion

33:24.511 --> 33:36.168
of his new science, writing a book about his new science called Mechanics, which, gosh, seems like it was there all along.

33:36.569 --> 33:41.817
Sorry, before I put this away, I'm sorry, you have to see this.

33:41.857 --> 33:46.904
This is Galileo's handwritten announcement of the discovery of mechanics.

33:48.647 --> 33:49.868
And I'm holding it in my hands.

33:50.049 --> 33:53.033
I'm not touching it, but I'm holding it in my hand.

33:53.823 --> 34:22.125
GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO GALILEO

34:22.578 --> 34:23.859
This is one you might remember.

34:24.740 --> 34:28.844
Back in school, did you read about a letter that George Washington wrote?

34:29.765 --> 34:37.852
Where he says, just take a look, he says the... He gets Valley Forge.

34:37.872 --> 34:39.694
Valley Forge, yeah.

34:39.714 --> 34:49.403
And he says that he needs help and clothing and so forth because the men are barefoot and otherwise naked.

34:49.443 --> 34:50.104
That's...

34:50.472 --> 34:51.653
Part of American history.

34:51.673 --> 34:54.397
Yes, that's in almost every history book inside.

34:55.258 --> 34:57.801
And I'm just going to try to get right here.

34:57.821 --> 34:58.862
Here you go.

35:00.144 --> 35:00.685
Barefoot.

35:00.705 --> 35:01.125
Where is it?

35:01.165 --> 35:03.168
Barefoot and otherwise naked.

35:03.388 --> 35:03.969
Barefoot.

35:04.029 --> 35:04.649
I'm looking at it.

35:04.830 --> 35:06.732
Barefoot and otherwise naked.

35:06.772 --> 35:10.036
And that's where he describes how bad off they are.

35:10.056 --> 35:12.239
And to whom did he write this letter?

35:12.259 --> 35:13.661
Well, that's a good question.

35:13.721 --> 35:15.523
We're not sure, actually.

35:15.923 --> 35:18.066
Here's George Washington's signature here.

35:18.333 --> 35:25.860
And he wrote gentlemen, which normally means gentlemen, which means... G-N-T.

35:26.421 --> 35:27.922
It says, dated December 29th, 1777.

35:27.942 --> 35:32.106
It says Head of... Headquarters, Valley Forge.

35:32.347 --> 35:36.571
Headquarters, Valley Forge, December 29th, with a T-H, 1777.

35:38.753 --> 35:41.896
There's a 50-50 chance a gentleman means a congress.

35:42.616 --> 35:42.737
Right.

35:42.757 --> 35:45.319
But for all we know, it could mean the...

35:45.620 --> 35:49.464
Provincial Congress of New York or New Jersey or something.

35:49.484 --> 35:54.189
So it's either a Provincial Congress or of the United States Federal Congress.

35:54.349 --> 35:56.632
This is what we call historic fundraising.

35:56.652 --> 35:57.593
Yeah, right, exactly.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.654
He's looking for bucks.

36:00.676 --> 36:02.978
It's in beautiful condition.

36:02.998 --> 36:09.986
Yes, paper was much better years ago, and today's paper might be... From a dealer?

36:10.166 --> 36:11.087
This was at an auction.

36:11.107 --> 36:13.129
This was at a very small auction at

36:13.295 --> 36:13.796
Swan.

36:14.657 --> 36:15.538
It was.

36:15.558 --> 36:16.459
Swan had this?

36:16.479 --> 36:17.541
Swan, if you can believe it.

36:17.921 --> 36:19.103
I can't believe it.

36:19.424 --> 36:20.585
They estimated $4,000.

36:21.426 --> 36:22.228
How can it be?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.411
They didn't quote the letter.

36:24.471 --> 36:31.020
They just said, or maybe they did quote it, but they didn't recognize it was the famous letter.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.762
But who would have consigned it to Swan?

36:32.802 --> 36:40.433
I mean, it should have gone to... Well, even Swan didn't even know what they had, and so we called up Bart and said...

36:40.852 --> 36:42.213
Don't tell anybody you're going.

36:42.274 --> 36:44.015
Don't tell anybody what you're bidding on.

36:44.055 --> 36:46.018
Don't even look at the document.

36:46.118 --> 36:47.159
I don't care if it's fake or not.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.241
Just keep it cool.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.343
So you know what it was?

36:51.564 --> 36:52.505
Oh, yes.

36:53.065 --> 36:57.750
Well, because, I mean, they did quote it, I guess, but they didn't say this is from the history.

36:57.850 --> 36:59.092
And it was a quote that long.

36:59.152 --> 37:00.273
They quoted the whole letter.

37:00.333 --> 37:03.076
And so you had to read the letter to realize what it was.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.539
And Bart said, boy, he was.

37:05.619 --> 37:09.643
He had a grin on his face from ear to ear until all of a sudden, in comes

37:10.433 --> 37:12.856
the secretary of Malcolm Forbes.

37:12.876 --> 37:13.817
They missed that.

37:13.837 --> 37:14.638
No, they didn't.

37:14.858 --> 37:20.784
The secretary comes in, which means he was trying to send someone also not for raw suspicion.

37:21.605 --> 37:26.310
And so he had his secretary come to bid on it because no one wanted to tell Swan what they had.

37:27.131 --> 37:30.374
And so the bidding started, and it started at $2,000 or something like that.

37:30.394 --> 37:33.438
It went real low, and it went up and up and up.

37:33.458 --> 37:37.262
And about $30-some thousand, the secretary started sweating.

37:37.702 --> 37:40.305
And he says he knew he had it.

37:40.403 --> 37:44.690
And finally she gave up around $55,000 or something like that.

37:44.850 --> 37:48.195
And she must have gone back and raised probably a $5,000.

37:48.215 --> 37:49.157
No, she couldn't.

37:49.177 --> 37:51.340
They put a limit on, so she couldn't.

37:51.421 --> 37:56.328
Yeah, but Forbes generally... He generally grows himself, makes a big difference.

37:56.348 --> 37:57.871
Oh, yeah, because he gets all the ink out of it.

37:57.891 --> 38:01.837
I think, yeah, I think she was trying to pull fancy all this time.

38:01.857 --> 38:03.760
Well, I mean, we've talked with him many times.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.483
She's not that infallible, but...

38:06.273 --> 38:09.498
I don't know why he sent the secretary, and no one else was around.

38:09.518 --> 38:10.760
No one else was bidding on the secretary.

38:10.780 --> 38:12.082
What was your mandate to buy?

38:12.723 --> 38:14.606
You know, without giving any figures, do I get it?

38:14.746 --> 38:18.071
I believe I had something like slightly under 100,000 or something.

38:18.111 --> 38:20.375
I didn't want to go too, too high.

38:20.435 --> 38:23.099
You know, I don't know why I said that.

38:23.119 --> 38:24.742
I think 70, 80,000.

38:24.902 --> 38:25.743
I don't know what I said.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.987
You'd have been very disappointed if you didn't get it.

38:28.007 --> 38:30.952
Yes, I would have been heartbroken if I didn't get it.

38:30.972 --> 38:33.816
But, you know, you've got to say, you can't say unlimited.

38:34.403 --> 38:38.269
because you can do a rostro-force type thing.

38:38.289 --> 38:39.831
You can go crazy.

38:40.091 --> 38:42.595
Here's the Constitutional Constitution.

38:42.615 --> 38:47.162
I thought I'd bring that down because that's constitutional.

38:47.182 --> 38:50.487
You notice you can put your hands on like this only because we have a sheet of mylar.

38:50.547 --> 38:51.448
I'm not going to do that.

38:51.569 --> 38:53.271
I might just put my hand on.

38:53.291 --> 38:54.152
That's the mylar.

38:54.473 --> 38:56.316
I don't want to pass the paper, too, if you want.

38:56.336 --> 38:56.636
I will.

38:57.538 --> 38:58.579
Is that more old?

38:59.120 --> 39:02.024
No, that's exactly how it was.

39:02.044 --> 39:02.886
Don't worry.

39:02.986 --> 39:03.166
Okay.

39:03.486 --> 39:03.887
I'm sticking here.

39:04.947 --> 39:16.880
As you can see, the Confederate Constitution almost mimics the United States Constitution, such as we the people.

39:17.641 --> 39:18.121
Same thing.

39:18.642 --> 39:32.457
We the people of the Confederate States, each state acting for itself, comma, and then the sovereign and independent character, comma, in order to form a permanent

39:32.723 --> 39:51.888
Federal, capital F, government, capital G. Establish justice, ensure with an E domestic tranquility, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, dash to which ends we invoke the favor and guidance of Almighty God.

39:53.330 --> 39:54.272
Wow.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.875
To ordain and establish this Constitution,

39:57.125 --> 39:59.548
for the Confederate States of America.

39:59.568 --> 40:00.849
That's the end of the first page.

40:00.869 --> 40:11.702
Most of it is almost identical to our federal constitution, except they wanted the president for six years.

40:11.722 --> 40:13.404
That's what we're trying to do right now, in fact.

40:13.424 --> 40:15.406
Everybody says we should have the president longer.

40:15.666 --> 40:17.328
One term, six years, and that's it.

40:17.348 --> 40:17.769
Six years.

40:17.789 --> 40:19.751
That's what they had, in fact.

40:20.452 --> 40:24.837
Any bill that was proposed to Congress could only have one topic.

40:25.289 --> 40:30.837
That's what they're trying to do, too, now.

40:30.857 --> 40:37.165
Yeah, they knew what the fallacies, the bad parts of the Constitution.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.727
Now, what do you think they said about slavery?

40:39.769 --> 40:40.470
I'd love to know.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.673
They outlawed slavery.

40:43.033 --> 40:45.777
I mean, they outlawed importation of slavery.

40:45.857 --> 40:46.638
That's in here.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.500
That's in the Constitution.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.782
Isn't that interesting?

40:50.083 --> 40:52.686
So the South wasn't the nasty guy.

40:52.786 --> 40:54.148
They were breeding, though.

40:54.331 --> 40:59.958
They were reading them, but still, I mean, importation is a big business, and you can buy more and keep the price.

41:00.258 --> 41:08.708
If they cut off importation of slaves, if they don't have importation of slaves, the price goes up, and when you buy one and buy a new one, you have to pay a higher price.

41:09.929 --> 41:12.232
Actually, the... I didn't know that.

41:12.753 --> 41:15.496
Importation of slaves, I think, had been stopped many years prior.

41:15.536 --> 41:17.378
Did you learn that in reading this document?

41:17.418 --> 41:18.720
Yeah, reading this, right.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.001
Reading this, and it's...

41:20.335 --> 41:42.192
in the archival state i think i took a xerox of it first and then but nevertheless yeah but what i'm saying is you learned it yes after having acquired now that was a law of an american law prior to this we couldn't import places like 1806 or something even though the united states was the last major country in the world

41:42.982 --> 41:49.369
But what the South did not want to do is they didn't want to lose their huge investments that they already had.

41:49.609 --> 41:50.730
That's the problem.

41:50.770 --> 42:01.721
That's why the Civil War, because if they could have been reimbursed for their losses, they would have been fined.

42:01.821 --> 42:07.167
But to say, OK, we're going to stop slavery and you're going to have to claim bankruptcy, they didn't want to do it.

42:07.487 --> 42:12.432
I'm sure many of them were just as concerned about human rights and so forth.

42:12.766 --> 42:13.647
Wow.

42:14.088 --> 42:17.634
And there's some other changes, too, from our other constitution.

42:17.654 --> 42:19.236
Is this a box that you had made for it?

42:19.296 --> 42:20.057
Yeah, we made that.

42:20.158 --> 42:25.205
Some of these are—this we made, this one was existing, this one's existing.

42:25.826 --> 42:28.511
Some we had made, this one's existing, this one we had made.

42:28.551 --> 42:29.292
Okay.

42:29.312 --> 42:31.996
But you do that, in other words, when you do that?

42:33.098 --> 42:38.927
Yeah, there are case makers or book case makers, or whatever you want to call it.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.950
This one was already made.

42:41.740 --> 42:51.374
This is the Thanksgiving proclamation in the United States, proclaiming Thanksgiving as a national holiday.

42:57.704 --> 43:04.474
It's also a sign by George Washington.

43:04.494 --> 43:09.061
This is George Washington, of course, since he was first president, proclaiming Thanksgiving as a national holiday.

43:09.081 --> 43:09.942
Do you have a date on it?

43:10.293 --> 43:11.795
1783, October 3rd?

43:11.815 --> 43:14.278
1789.

43:14.318 --> 43:16.060
1789, of course.

43:16.640 --> 43:27.973
Given under my hand at the city of New York, Thursday of October and the year of our Lord... The third day of October.

43:28.053 --> 43:32.358
The third day of October and the year of our Lord, 1789, G. Washington.

43:32.999 --> 43:39.186
And it says at the top, by the... I can't make it out.

43:39.503 --> 43:47.851
By the President of the United States of America, a proclamation, whereas it is a duty... Well, I don't even read the whole thing.

43:47.871 --> 43:49.633
He is declaring Thanksgiving.

43:49.933 --> 43:51.154
Right.

43:51.174 --> 43:51.415
Wow.

43:52.936 --> 43:56.079
It's actually quite... It's wonderful.

43:56.099 --> 43:59.743
I mean, if you need the wording... That should be in the National Art Times.

44:00.664 --> 44:01.605
You know that, don't you?

44:01.625 --> 44:04.808
I think there is two or three copies of this, and I think they have one.

44:06.650 --> 44:07.030
Okay.

44:07.482 --> 44:13.188
I should mention again that some of these are unique documents in that they only wrote one.

44:13.769 --> 44:22.418
But like this, when he's proclamation, he couldn't have taken this document to every state, for example, so he probably wrote 13 of them.

44:22.438 --> 44:23.279
But in his own hand?

44:25.241 --> 44:26.382
This is in the secretary hand.

44:26.422 --> 44:28.004
He signed it in his own hand.

44:28.104 --> 44:30.546
And the word third is in his own hand.

44:30.586 --> 44:34.030
That's very important.

44:34.162 --> 44:35.144
Yeah.

44:35.324 --> 44:37.848
The main body of the text is in another hand.

44:37.928 --> 44:38.469
Yes, that's correct.

44:38.489 --> 44:39.831
He has signed it and dated it.

44:40.051 --> 44:40.812
Yeah.

44:40.853 --> 44:40.993
Okay.

44:41.073 --> 44:42.135
And so somebody wrote out.

44:42.575 --> 44:44.498
That's one of perhaps several things.

44:44.518 --> 44:49.226
I think they wrote out that he had, well, he didn't devise the proclamation.

44:49.286 --> 44:51.529
Some of the secretary who wrote it, probably wrote it out.

44:51.549 --> 44:52.952
He was probably the PhD.

44:52.972 --> 44:55.696
You don't expect the president of the United States to do all this.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.959
There was no such thing as a draft in his hand.

44:58.420 --> 45:01.485
Some secretary probably drafted it out and then wrote these.

45:02.039 --> 45:03.461
and then he signed me.

45:03.621 --> 45:09.407
And there's probably, I think there's three million left out of the 13 million president, which is a shame in itself.

45:09.447 --> 45:11.309
What happened in the other 10?

45:11.329 --> 45:12.711
But National Archives has one.

45:12.811 --> 45:16.695
I think there's, I think New York has one.

45:16.935 --> 45:19.658
And all the other states have food care.

45:19.758 --> 45:22.141
Again, at auction?

45:22.161 --> 45:23.002
This was plumbing.

45:23.603 --> 45:24.103
Good for John.

45:24.163 --> 45:24.904
16,000.

45:25.565 --> 45:28.008
And John offered it to you?

45:28.128 --> 45:28.468
Yes.

45:28.938 --> 45:31.200
Essentially, so actually, we were visiting him one day.

45:31.541 --> 45:33.002
He says, here's something might interest you.

45:33.583 --> 45:34.884
I said, you've got to be kidding me.

45:34.904 --> 45:35.004
What?

45:35.024 --> 45:35.665
Is it a joke?

45:36.465 --> 45:37.026
You know what I mean?

45:37.046 --> 45:38.407
It might be interesting.

45:38.427 --> 45:39.889
He says, well, I was saving himself.

45:39.909 --> 45:42.592
You know, we very rarely get to these places.

45:42.652 --> 45:43.653
And so he was saving.

45:43.673 --> 45:45.695
He didn't want to call us or write us or anything.

45:45.735 --> 45:49.058
He wanted to actually present us with it as when we came.

45:49.178 --> 45:50.519
That's a nice John Fleming story.

45:50.579 --> 45:51.480
Yes, yeah.

45:51.640 --> 45:52.261
So he made it.

45:52.281 --> 45:55.344
I mean, John Fleming's in my book, too, by the way.

45:55.364 --> 45:56.786
He's a wonder.

45:56.806 --> 45:57.326
I really enjoyed it.

45:57.726 --> 45:58.287
Loved his library.

45:58.520 --> 46:04.748
Here's a letter of Martin Luther marking the recognition of the Protestant movement.

46:06.351 --> 46:08.714
We're not talking about a little letter, you know.

46:09.895 --> 46:17.065
Yeah, this is... Well, what had happened... I've got all kinds of Luther letters in here.

46:17.085 --> 46:19.088
Just a pile of Luther letters in here.

46:21.791 --> 46:22.552
Let's see here.

46:25.176 --> 46:27.379
Yes, this is the one recognizing the

46:28.912 --> 46:29.513
Yeah.

46:29.533 --> 46:40.084
This is the one that he wrote to his king, who was a... In Germany, they didn't have kings.

46:40.104 --> 46:42.366
They had electors or something.

46:42.386 --> 46:43.227
Something.

46:43.427 --> 46:44.108
To his leader.

46:44.488 --> 46:45.730
To his sovereign, let's say.

46:45.750 --> 46:46.691
His sovereign, right.

46:47.151 --> 46:48.272
Kurfürst, they call him.

46:50.094 --> 46:50.275
K-U-R?

46:50.455 --> 46:50.755
Kurfürst.

46:50.775 --> 46:50.915
Yeah.

46:50.935 --> 46:52.677
Don't worry about that.

46:52.697 --> 46:53.138
Maybe a duke.

46:53.178 --> 46:54.519
Maybe he's a duke or something like that.

46:54.539 --> 46:56.781
But they had little states who were independent.

46:56.822 --> 46:57.282
They call them dukes.

46:57.548 --> 46:58.930
But they were equal to kings.

46:58.970 --> 47:01.674
The king of England was equal to them.

47:01.694 --> 47:02.616
And he is announcing?

47:03.297 --> 47:14.513
And what had happened was that the Catholic religion did not recognize these protesting people who Luther was the most vocal of them.

47:15.635 --> 47:25.750
However, in about 1532, Turks, who pretty much were, here's Europe and here's the Ottoman Empire, and they were pretty much

47:26.185 --> 47:53.880
on an equal basis uh in that half the time the pokes would be over here in constant mobile and half time they'd be in rome i mean they sort of went back and forth so whether or not europe was the head of the world or whether turkey was or the ottoman empire was a good question and the border which is along maybe between hungary and austria or something like that is a lot of there was a lot of wars between the turks and the europeans and of course

47:54.282 --> 48:00.088
There would be some, sometimes France would get together with Turkey and they would fight Italy or something.

48:00.188 --> 48:04.993
And so there was always this border between the Turks and the Europeans.

48:05.013 --> 48:07.336
And the Turks were about to attack Rome.

48:08.497 --> 48:12.181
And because the Pope was in Rome and said Constantinople at this time.

48:13.102 --> 48:23.192
And so the Pope asked Luther if his protesting people would help by joining the army, the Pope's army.

48:23.527 --> 48:25.170
And Luther said, you've got to be kidding.

48:25.811 --> 48:30.758
You know, here you won't let out, you won't even recognize us and you want us to fight for you.

48:30.778 --> 48:34.324
So Luther sent back the, I'm paraphrasing this.

48:34.344 --> 48:35.746
I'm just real quick.

48:35.806 --> 48:36.367
Go ahead, please.

48:36.427 --> 48:38.530
I sent back the message to him.

48:38.710 --> 48:43.337
If you recognize our movement, we will help you fight the Turks.

48:43.978 --> 48:45.461
And the Pope had no choice.

48:45.721 --> 48:52.251
And so he offered, yes, we will, he had several stipulations, but he essentially said,

48:52.923 --> 48:59.529
We will recognize the Protestant movement if you, the Protestants, join our army and fight the church.

48:59.549 --> 49:08.857
And here is, this is the letter where Luther is accepting the, his suggestion.

49:08.877 --> 49:09.798
And that's 1532.

49:09.838 --> 49:11.380
1532, yeah.

49:12.741 --> 49:13.001
Wow.

49:13.582 --> 49:17.705
Since I have no other Luther, that's, that's why, it's hard to read because it's in German, of course.

49:19.127 --> 49:22.930
Here's another Luther letter, and this one,

49:25.137 --> 49:40.280
This is a letter written in 1530 where the Pope was trying to get Luther to come back.

49:40.721 --> 49:43.585
In fact, Luther thought he was a Catholic.

49:43.645 --> 49:46.610
It was just that he wanted to change the church.

49:46.650 --> 49:54.081
They had a meeting called the Augsburg Confession where Luther was supposed to come

49:54.618 --> 49:56.420
and confess his sins.

49:56.820 --> 50:06.592
Although, of course, Luther's idea was he was going to present his proclamation, Protestant proclamation, and that would be the basis of the Protestant religion.

50:07.372 --> 50:22.009
And this was a letter to a fellow named Philip Melaschthon, who was his right-hand Philip Melaschthon, who was, if you looked in any of the religious books, Luther is number one, Melaschthon is number two as far as being famous.

50:22.850 --> 50:32.139
And Philip was his right-hand man at the Augsburg Confession and was trying to put across Luther's program.

50:32.739 --> 50:37.964
And in this, and Philip had written back, they aren't buying it, they just won't accept our terms.

50:38.525 --> 50:46.772
And so here Luther says, okay, try it once more, and if they don't accept our theses, then give up.

50:47.393 --> 50:49.935
Has he already banged the theses on the door at this point?

50:49.955 --> 50:51.777
Yeah, 10 years prior, 11 years prior.

50:53.258 --> 51:02.410
But this is, the Augsburg Confession, they did present the basis of the Protestant religion.

51:02.430 --> 51:12.123
And we even have one more here where he is telling how he is spreading the doctrine.

51:12.143 --> 51:14.786
This is much later on, 1545.

51:15.367 --> 51:19.452
And he says, we have people in Turkey, we have people in Hungary.

51:19.651 --> 51:22.955
Our disciples, some of our disciples are already in Turkey.

51:23.236 --> 51:24.117
You're translating this.

51:24.497 --> 51:24.738
Yeah.

51:24.918 --> 51:26.120
Well, no, this is in English.

51:26.140 --> 51:28.022
I can't read German.

51:29.324 --> 51:32.849
And he's telling you how his evangelizing is going.

51:32.889 --> 51:36.153
That's a few.

51:36.173 --> 51:36.854
There's even more.

51:37.074 --> 51:38.436
These you keep in the house, I notice.

51:39.158 --> 51:44.027
Well, only because we were working on them.

51:44.087 --> 51:47.353
I have some others I'd love to show you, but I don't have them with at the moment.

51:47.474 --> 51:51.621
Yes.

51:52.543 --> 51:59.576
Some of these, they can only study Xeroxes, and they have to have credentials and so forth in some cases.

51:59.917 --> 52:00.538
But that happens.

52:00.578 --> 52:02.702
We have to do that everywhere we go.

52:02.918 --> 52:28.538
this happens to be the one that i said was my favorite this is the pope lucius the third for claiming the sacred all right this is state again now this is a large thing that i've never described for my typist here yes uh and i would say it's perhaps three feet by perhaps two and a half feet yeah and it's on vellum it's on the animal skin of sorts

52:28.822 --> 52:31.907
That's a papal seal there.

52:32.127 --> 52:35.973
That actually is part of the Pope's signature.

52:36.014 --> 52:38.377
He probably made this little cross at the top.

52:39.058 --> 52:53.281
Although, also, these things which say SS are means subscripti, meaning, which should mean, everybody thinks it means, I wrote this myself.

52:53.341 --> 52:55.605
In fact, this is ego means I,

52:56.041 --> 52:57.123
So-and-so.

52:57.484 --> 52:59.708
This is the true collector, by the way.

52:59.888 --> 53:00.309
Is that right?

53:00.429 --> 53:02.152
The true collector knows his collection.

53:02.473 --> 53:07.462
But what I've written in my notes here as you're talking, as I said, he knows his collection.

53:08.303 --> 53:12.491
You're telling me about, you're giving me the history of Martin Luther.

53:12.551 --> 53:12.831
Yes.

53:13.713 --> 53:15.957
And you see, this isn't just a document.

53:16.308 --> 53:45.285
you understand the context i'm sorry become a amateur historian amateur scientist amateur but again what did we call this document so what would the title of the nation or it's a decree proclaiming a decree for proclaiming the sacred duty of the knights of the holy crusades a decree proclaiming the sacred duty duty of the knights of the holy crusades this

53:45.400 --> 53:47.566
authorizes and sanctions the Crusades.

53:47.626 --> 53:52.538
Tell us what their duties are and how they are supposed to save their maidens and so forth.

53:52.618 --> 53:55.967
The Crusades.
