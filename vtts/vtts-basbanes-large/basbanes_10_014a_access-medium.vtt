00:05.650 --> 00:11.756
Really, this is a copy of the first printed catalog?

00:11.836 --> 00:19.403
It's the first printed catalog of this library, but there were no predecessors in other libraries.

00:19.863 --> 00:20.063
Really?

00:20.143 --> 00:21.945
It's the first printed catalog.

00:22.225 --> 00:23.747
Dating from 1595?

00:23.767 --> 00:26.349
It's 1595, yes.

00:26.389 --> 00:34.797
Can you give me some sense of how this library developed to this degree of sophistication?

00:36.211 --> 01:03.745
Yes, I could tell you that I don't know if you know the history of this town of Leiden and the place it took in the war between the Netherlands and Spain around 1570.

01:03.785 --> 01:05.307
It was

01:05.557 --> 01:32.391
the Spaniards occupied Leiden this time and the citizens were very brave so the Spaniards couldn't take the city so Prince William of Orange, William the Silent he decided that Leiden as a

01:33.535 --> 01:41.805
token of gratitude, should have the first university in the Netherlands.

01:42.025 --> 01:43.187
Really?

01:43.427 --> 01:58.345
Also, not the Netherlands in the old sense of the Netherlands, including Belgium, because there you have a university which is older, that's Louvain Loeven.

01:59.573 --> 02:03.537
But in the Netherlands as it's now, Leiden is the oldest university.

02:03.597 --> 02:04.839
It's from 1574.

02:05.059 --> 02:10.004
And so it was a gift.

02:11.125 --> 02:13.168
The university was a gift.

02:13.228 --> 02:29.445
The university was a gift from Prince William of Orange because the town had the heroic role of Leiden in that war.

02:29.577 --> 02:42.989
So the university started in 1574, and so it's not easy to say exactly when the university library started.

02:43.009 --> 02:44.631
That's pretty close.

02:44.851 --> 02:45.772
In 20 years they have a catalog.

02:45.852 --> 02:48.354
Yes, it was in the 18s, in the 1580s.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.643
So we had to decide which

02:58.788 --> 03:04.495
Here we should choose for our fourth centenary.

03:05.936 --> 03:17.310
And there were some good reasons to choose 1987 as the year of the foundation of this library.

03:17.510 --> 03:20.133
The 400th anniversary.

03:20.193 --> 03:21.775
That is really amazing, isn't it?

03:22.058 --> 03:23.019
It is.

03:23.039 --> 03:29.646
It's not... It's not the oldest there are universities which are older, but it's not bad.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.129
No, it's pretty impressive.

03:32.950 --> 03:39.877
So, obviously, with the establishment of a university, you had to have books, right?

03:39.917 --> 03:42.921
I mean, books are synonymous with the university, aren't they?

03:43.061 --> 03:43.521
A library.

03:43.541 --> 03:44.122
Yes, yes.

03:44.803 --> 03:46.484
Where did the first collections come from?

03:49.147 --> 03:51.610
They were mainly gifts from...

03:52.433 --> 03:54.215
from professors.

03:55.757 --> 04:05.649
There was also a huge gift, a polyglot Bible, which was donated by Prince William of Orange.

04:05.829 --> 04:15.241
It's one of the first books of this library, the polyglot Bible printed by Plantin in Antwerp.

04:18.124 --> 04:22.069
This, of course, was a very important book, has always been a very important book city.

04:22.808 --> 04:34.326
Yes, it was... Plantain, I don't know, how do you say it in English?

04:35.688 --> 04:40.235
Plantain, the printer of Antwerp.

04:40.255 --> 04:41.237
Yes, he was the printer.

04:41.477 --> 04:43.620
He was the printer, yes, Plantain.

04:44.201 --> 04:49.930
And he lived for some time here in Leiden, in the Netherlands.

04:52.475 --> 04:58.241
There have been other printers, Raffalengius.

05:00.283 --> 05:00.823
Can I just see that?

05:00.883 --> 05:05.268
Is this book a 400th anniversary catalogue?

05:05.288 --> 05:06.409
He had an exhibition.

05:06.729 --> 05:07.110
Oh, really?

05:07.610 --> 05:14.817
Is this something I can purchase, this catalogue?

05:15.017 --> 05:17.099
We are out of... We don't have any.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.921
No, we have.

05:18.941 --> 05:20.743
So that's...

05:21.550 --> 05:24.794
I'm very sorry that I can't give you one.

05:24.814 --> 05:27.217
No, no, I'd love to buy one is what I'd like to do.

05:27.398 --> 05:30.081
There's no chance of doing that.

05:30.121 --> 05:34.407
This looks exactly like the kind of history thing.

05:34.427 --> 05:42.758
Books and manuscripts are from our own collection, so we didn't... They must have this at Harvard where I do it.

05:42.778 --> 05:43.319
I'm sure.

05:43.359 --> 05:44.540
I'm sure.

05:45.542 --> 05:48.165
And the Joyer Club, which I belong to in New York,

05:49.343 --> 06:14.406
this is the uh so there are no more of these right i can't take this another uh yes you no maybe we could just i can ask if i 1987 let's ask me something about the printers one of those printers in the

06:16.462 --> 06:22.730
in the beginning, in the beginning time of the university was Franciscus Raffalengius.

06:22.790 --> 06:28.497
He was very famous also in Arabic, printing of Arabic books.

06:29.358 --> 06:31.380
And he made an Arabic type specimen.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.887
And that was that he worked at the Plant... How do you say?

06:37.027 --> 06:41.292
Plantin... But you know him.

06:42.454 --> 06:45.237
He was the very famous printer, Plantinus.

06:45.841 --> 06:48.104
and he worked here for some time.

06:48.544 --> 06:56.495
Later on he went back to Antwerp and there he became very famous.

06:57.235 --> 07:15.038
But Rafa Rengis was of his printing office and this is a catalogue of an exhibition we had here some time ago and I can give you this.

07:15.659 --> 07:18.803
I'm a writer who believes in getting as much material as I can.

07:18.823 --> 07:23.027
I hurt my back carrying my briefcase with all the stuff in it.

07:24.950 --> 07:30.896
But over 400 years, how large are the collections now, roughly, would you say?

07:30.916 --> 07:37.444
We don't know exactly, but we always say that we have about three million views.

07:38.085 --> 07:38.725
Three million?

07:38.966 --> 07:39.787
Three million.

07:39.807 --> 07:40.047
Wow.

07:40.447 --> 07:44.552
But that's not as large as the...

07:45.157 --> 07:48.382
But this is the Library of Congress, which you know.

07:48.703 --> 07:54.532
That's right, I know the Library of Congress is not at Harvard either, but this is a small country.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.234
Yes.

07:58.398 --> 08:13.341
And it's famous for, when we speak about older books and older manuscripts, we have a very famous collection of Latin manuscripts, the Vossius Collection.

08:14.249 --> 08:20.137
which contains many very important Latin manuscripts.

08:20.157 --> 08:35.616
For example, one of the most important manuscripts of Lucretius De Reru Natura is in this library.

08:35.877 --> 08:44.087
A manuscript which is also very important for the text critical edition of this book.

08:44.675 --> 08:48.859
Do you still have the original structure or an early structure, the building?

08:52.842 --> 08:56.365
The building itself, yes.

08:56.745 --> 09:04.932
The first library was in a, at the end of the 16th century, was in a chapel.

09:06.534 --> 09:14.040
No, the first library when it was not yet a library,

09:14.695 --> 09:21.626
was a room in the academic building which you see over there.

09:21.646 --> 09:24.651
That's the building with the tower.

09:25.192 --> 09:26.795
To the right or straight ahead?

09:26.815 --> 09:27.937
To the right hand.

09:28.818 --> 09:38.374
And later on the books went to a chapel in...

09:38.995 --> 09:43.800
And the library was the upper part of that chapel.

09:43.920 --> 10:00.415
It was the two stories on the... In the lower parts, it had a... It was an anatomical... Theatrum anatomical.

10:00.435 --> 10:06.741
It was a place where the corpses were... A morgue, not a morgue, but...

10:06.940 --> 10:13.368
But the professors took the corpses and took the body, the corpses part.

10:13.528 --> 10:14.189
Dissection.

10:14.369 --> 10:15.610
Dissection, yes.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.916
It was in the... An anatomy lab, I guess, is what we would call it.

10:20.857 --> 10:21.257
I don't know.

10:22.399 --> 10:35.935
From that time, from the 17th century, a little bit later on, there's a very famous...

10:36.455 --> 10:42.564
It's an image of the library.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.527
An engraving.

10:45.869 --> 11:01.993
If you are interested in library history... This book intends to be... I think I know the picture.

11:02.013 --> 11:02.794
It's famous.

11:02.854 --> 11:04.757
This was the library at the time.

11:05.480 --> 11:29.040
library from 1593 to 1820 this is also this chapel and this is the engraving that's a very famous it was in in the chapel there uh what's his name anthony hobson used this for the end sheets of his book the great libraries it's famous that's here

11:29.358 --> 11:30.500
Is that building still here?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.063
That's the building I named to.

11:33.143 --> 11:37.810
It's not that building you see there, but it's 50 metres behind there.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.713
Does this physical structure still exist?

11:42.236 --> 11:43.117
No, not exactly.

11:43.157 --> 11:44.319
You can't see it.

11:44.419 --> 11:51.349
The chapel is there, but they have made rooms and small...

11:51.852 --> 11:56.218
small rooms in it, so you can't see the structure.

11:56.238 --> 12:01.085
That's a very famous engraving, yes.

12:01.826 --> 12:11.700
We have a shop here in the library where you could buy a very large... In fact, at Skollcluster, you know, they have the famous

12:11.984 --> 12:15.087
Achimbaldo picture of the librarian that's put together.

12:15.147 --> 12:15.527
Oh, yes.

12:15.547 --> 12:16.969
That's a fruit.

12:17.009 --> 12:18.390
Well, that's the original is there.

12:18.811 --> 12:19.551
I didn't know that.

12:19.731 --> 12:19.892
Oh.

12:20.472 --> 12:24.256
It was war booty, which they don't even know where they got it, but there's the original.

12:24.556 --> 12:25.637
And I bought a poster there.

12:26.578 --> 12:30.122
Because in the dust jacket of my book, we have that picture on the back of it.

12:30.862 --> 12:32.364
So I was very pleased to see that.

12:33.124 --> 12:36.267
So there are more pictures of the... Yes.

12:36.348 --> 12:39.891
And then in the... So this is the history of the library here?

12:39.911 --> 12:41.012
Yes, it was the library, yes.

12:41.431 --> 12:46.017
from Dr. P. C. Molhuysen.

12:46.037 --> 12:48.040
Do you think that was ever translated to him?

12:48.180 --> 12:48.821
No, it's not.

12:48.861 --> 12:52.626
He was keeper of the manuscripts of the library.

12:53.467 --> 12:53.847
M-O-L.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.850
How do you spell his name?

12:56.311 --> 12:56.711
M-O-L.

12:56.831 --> 13:02.278
H-U-Y-S-E-M.

13:02.298 --> 13:07.605
It is from, it's history of the university library at Leiden.

13:08.827 --> 13:11.050
It's from 1905.

13:16.379 --> 13:43.703
so then at the end of the 19th century so they extended the building and next to the chapel they built this structure and with these rooms and that's still there no because it

13:44.223 --> 13:45.465
became too small again.

13:45.745 --> 13:53.855
So at the beginning of this century, there was again an extension of the building.

13:54.476 --> 13:56.398
I don't know if I can show you.

13:57.580 --> 14:00.423
And you can see it now, how it is.

14:05.069 --> 14:06.131
No, these are the older.

14:08.674 --> 14:10.416
Let's take a look later.

14:13.788 --> 14:14.789
Oh, these are nice.

14:16.391 --> 14:17.071
These are beautiful.

14:21.816 --> 14:31.445
These are the pictures used, and these are the original pictures you used in the... These are all the pictures you used in the mail.

14:31.506 --> 14:32.286
Yes, yes.

14:34.809 --> 14:39.053
And the...

14:39.809 --> 14:42.293
This is a great book.

14:43.775 --> 14:44.796
You've seen it?

14:44.816 --> 14:47.621
No, but I'm sure I can find it.

14:47.641 --> 14:48.422
It's in English, yes.

14:49.463 --> 14:50.545
That's what I'm looking for.

14:50.926 --> 14:55.973
Leiden University in the 17th Century.

14:59.939 --> 15:01.381
An Exchange of Learning.

15:05.327 --> 15:09.293
And that's Thomas H.

15:10.741 --> 15:27.763
L-U-N-S-I-N-G-H S-C-H E-U-R And this is published by the university, right?

15:27.803 --> 15:28.844
University.

15:29.104 --> 15:29.645
Okay, good.

15:29.665 --> 15:38.436
And it contains an article by

15:47.056 --> 16:16.033
yes uh she writes about the first uh century of the uh this is page 394 393 how many pages until uh four five nine three ninety two to four five nine that's that's that's what i have to get right there first time

16:16.418 --> 16:43.320
and there's also an article about printers and scholars the officina plantiniana that's the that's the that's the printing press okay that's page 388 and that's um do they have a copy of this downstairs you think in the library i can make it then i can zero access i could copy this

16:43.790 --> 16:46.554
I can ask to make copies.

16:47.075 --> 16:47.956
That would be great.

16:48.898 --> 16:52.202
And I'll happily pay whatever the charges are.

16:57.811 --> 17:01.576
Yes, I know that you can have copies of me.

17:01.596 --> 17:03.359
That would be spectacular.

17:03.379 --> 17:04.200
That would save me.

17:04.320 --> 17:09.268
I would ask, also, these two articles about the printers and scholars?

17:09.768 --> 17:12.953
That's what I'm here to find out.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.679
That would be great.

17:17.419 --> 17:22.064
It's also an article about academic relations between Sweden and... Yes.

17:22.985 --> 17:23.766
Excellent.

17:23.886 --> 17:24.246
Thank you.

17:29.952 --> 17:31.173
1983.

17:33.115 --> 17:39.361
And until that time, we inhabited the buildings which we talked about.

17:39.381 --> 17:43.345
So you can...

17:43.882 --> 17:48.186
find the old structure, that we have old books and old manuscripts.

17:48.607 --> 17:50.028
But would it be possible?

17:50.389 --> 17:51.750
Yeah.

17:51.770 --> 17:56.055
And with not much, you don't have to, I hate to, I don't mean to intrude in your schedule.

17:56.355 --> 17:58.117
But what do you want?

17:58.257 --> 17:59.598
Have a look at the building?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.881
A look at the building and some of your collections.

18:01.901 --> 18:03.823
And some of the collections.

18:04.203 --> 18:06.806
Something which you could do in a half an hour.

18:07.106 --> 18:12.292
I don't want me to impose too greatly on your schedule.

18:12.312 --> 18:13.753
I realise this is put together very

18:14.257 --> 18:26.170
It would be nice to show Sebastian the exhibition of art which we have in the downstairs.

18:26.991 --> 18:32.056
They are not books, but it's art about books.

18:32.156 --> 18:33.437
It's very interesting.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.341
It's very interesting.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.962
I saw it tomorrow.

18:38.022 --> 18:40.585
I haven't seen it before, but it's very interesting.

18:40.784 --> 18:42.588
I didn't look at that yet.

18:42.608 --> 18:53.089
Oh, but it's interesting to see that I... I'm sorry, could you say your name, but do you have a card that I can... I have a card, yes.

18:53.153 --> 19:01.343
The central part, the lending bureau, in which the connection between the sister and the library is made.

19:01.403 --> 19:16.821
Here are given the books to the students, to the scholars, and so this is the central part of this library, and the library is the central part of the total complex of buildings of the university around.

19:17.602 --> 19:19.003
So this is the heart of the university?

19:19.023 --> 19:20.525
Yes, it is the heart of the university.

19:20.545 --> 19:22.047
That was his idea.

19:22.263 --> 19:25.586
The architecture.

19:25.606 --> 19:26.106
Yeah, the architecture.

19:26.126 --> 19:35.815
And there are several things that there you see the old observatory, and it is the cupo which makes the relation with that architecture.

19:35.835 --> 19:36.475
It's beautiful.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.198
What kind of wood is that, out of curiosity?

19:39.798 --> 19:40.319
Wood?

19:40.339 --> 19:41.059
I don't know.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.981
I wonder if it's a duck there.

19:44.022 --> 19:44.462
It's beautiful.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.285
It's a beautiful building.

19:49.226 --> 19:51.308
But you did do a circular...

19:51.676 --> 19:52.517
No.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.463
So you worked closely with the architect, you said?

19:57.823 --> 19:58.064
Yes.

19:58.344 --> 20:01.908
And what kinds of things were you concerned about incorporating in the new building?

20:02.509 --> 20:08.877
I was a specialist for the special departments.

20:08.897 --> 20:09.638
There we go now.

20:10.338 --> 20:21.632
We had separated the Western special departments, so manuscripts, old books, and collection of old maps and atlases of which I'm the curator.

20:22.152 --> 20:24.936
And on the other part are the oriental.

20:25.116 --> 20:34.328
So I can give you a quick idea of our rooms here.

20:34.348 --> 20:50.370
And you can leave your... And the manuscripts consist of how many items?

20:54.518 --> 20:58.042
and go through the special steps.

20:58.062 --> 21:01.966
So this is maps probably.

21:06.831 --> 21:09.393
Spectacular collection of maps.

21:09.413 --> 21:09.694
Yes.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.358
I have a collection collected in the last century.

21:14.378 --> 21:17.321
Oh, my goodness.

21:19.884 --> 21:20.745
By Mr.

21:21.535 --> 21:23.939
It's on my card.

21:24.059 --> 21:29.028
I will give you my card at a moment.

21:29.048 --> 21:32.353
How many maps in this room would you say?

21:32.393 --> 21:33.535
80,000.

21:34.056 --> 21:40.868
And there are 20,000 prints and 1,300 witnesses.

21:40.948 --> 21:43.592
But I can get my card for you.

21:43.612 --> 21:44.033
Thank you.

21:51.353 --> 21:55.820
He died, how do you pronounce his name, in Baudel?

21:55.840 --> 21:56.401
Baudelmeyenhaus.

21:57.142 --> 22:02.952
And he died in 1872 and requeathed his collection to the university.

22:03.954 --> 22:06.938
And what did his collection?

22:08.040 --> 22:15.252
Old maps of prints, topographical prints and addresses.

22:15.687 --> 22:21.374
What was the profession in general?

22:21.494 --> 22:22.495
Publishing.

22:22.976 --> 22:27.822
The most famous publishing house in Leiden in the 18th century, Luchtmans.

22:29.444 --> 22:32.868
Luchtmans was also publisher of the university.

22:33.509 --> 22:39.516
L-U-C-H-T-M-A-N-S.

22:40.457 --> 22:42.039
That's the name of the publishing house.

22:43.721 --> 22:43.821
Yeah.

22:46.383 --> 22:49.767
So he collected maps and atlases?

22:50.267 --> 23:01.839
Yes, he won by accident one of the large, famous siege plans of our 80 years' war.

23:01.859 --> 23:02.900
These are magnificent.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.163
In good condition.

23:05.183 --> 23:05.543
Really?

23:06.884 --> 23:08.646
Look at these, 16, 45.

23:08.686 --> 23:10.008
These are 300 years old.

23:13.571 --> 23:14.112
And they're in space.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.072
extraordinary condition, I think.

23:16.192 --> 23:18.674
Yes, extraordinary condition, yes.

23:18.694 --> 23:24.020
350 years old, I guess.

23:24.040 --> 23:31.146
And he was in the circumstance as director of the publishing house and very bookseller.

23:31.727 --> 23:35.050
He got the most beautiful things for himself.

23:37.032 --> 23:38.894
He got the most beautiful things for himself.

23:38.914 --> 23:39.074
Yes.

23:40.496 --> 23:42.057
And by accident, he was also

23:42.475 --> 23:46.540
one of the first who was involved with the history of cartography.

23:47.581 --> 24:03.521
And as you see, it's by accident on the table now, an alphabetical apparatus for the literary history of map makers and map engravers.

24:03.541 --> 24:11.250
So he was one of the first who made such a system with all these small annotations, as you see here.

24:15.837 --> 24:21.105
And that's the way he collected his information about map makers and map engravers.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.687
Did he ever write anything about it?

24:24.089 --> 24:26.573
He has written or he published something about it.

24:27.494 --> 24:31.480
He was also the first to publish on that field in the Netherlands.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.244
So, but we have to continue.

24:34.384 --> 24:45.540
Okay, would you just... Perhaps he also, one of the beautiful pieces from his collection, it's Kahn's plan.

24:45.976 --> 24:47.498
A garden plan, a garden plan.

24:47.518 --> 24:48.078
It's beautiful.

24:48.319 --> 24:48.859
Look at that.

24:49.160 --> 24:54.606
Of one of the large palaces of the princes of Nassau, Fonselaarsdijk.

24:55.147 --> 24:55.828
Look at that.

24:55.888 --> 24:56.709
Here is the palace.

24:59.051 --> 25:03.497
And here you see the... The gardens.

25:03.677 --> 25:06.400
The gardens and the woods and the meadows.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.044
I wonder if that garden still exists.

25:10.605 --> 25:11.826
Nothing more.

25:11.906 --> 25:12.187
Oh God.

25:12.307 --> 25:15.831
So it only exists in these plants.

25:17.161 --> 25:17.762
What a pity.

25:22.268 --> 25:26.834
I can't give you any look at that.

25:27.074 --> 25:28.296
That's okay.

25:28.356 --> 25:29.878
That's fine.

25:30.038 --> 25:31.540
This is all a bonus for me.

25:31.560 --> 25:37.487
We have to make the appointment not to come to each other properly.

25:37.508 --> 25:44.116
Doctor, this is... I can show you perhaps some of the famous maps here.

25:45.798 --> 25:47.100
From parchment on Palermo.

25:47.688 --> 25:51.812
How would you rank your map and atlas collection?

25:54.215 --> 25:55.096
How would you rank it?

25:55.116 --> 25:57.078
How would you rank it with other collections?

25:59.200 --> 26:02.944
How do you think it... Oh, the place and other collections.

26:03.505 --> 26:06.988
I think it is the largest collections of old maps in the Netherlands.

26:07.729 --> 26:11.333
And you can compare it as far as the old material.

26:11.903 --> 26:18.089
with the British Library map collection and the Bibliothek National Collection, the Australian National League.

26:18.109 --> 26:20.351
So one of the top four or five in the world, probably.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.973
I think so, yes.

26:22.073 --> 26:22.814
I'm sure in Europe.

26:23.855 --> 26:26.437
Well, if it's one of the best in Europe, it's one of the best in the world.

26:26.537 --> 26:39.750
I mean, that's... So we see here a manuscript map made at the occasion of a disaster of two East Indian men who...

26:41.384 --> 26:45.090
were drawn here in the mouth of the river Scheldt.

26:45.650 --> 26:49.857
You see here the Slieventart and the Anna Catalina.

26:50.057 --> 26:56.407
And 20 years ago, they found on the bottom of the sea the wreckage of the ship.

26:56.647 --> 26:57.428
Just 20 years ago?

26:57.448 --> 27:00.373
Yes, 20 years ago, with the help of this map.

27:00.713 --> 27:01.634
Oh, come on.

27:01.715 --> 27:02.796
This is the treasure map.

27:03.277 --> 27:04.539
This is called the treasure map?

27:04.559 --> 27:05.340
That's a good story.

27:06.402 --> 27:10.648
So what's the name, the actual name of the map, did you call it?

27:11.337 --> 27:35.252
this is i would say yes the sad annotation and picture of this map by reason of the disaster of two indian men flying

27:35.958 --> 27:37.480
Deer, the Flying Deer.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.382
What was the name of the ship?

27:39.422 --> 27:42.005
Yeah, the Flying Deer, and the Anna Catharina.

27:42.525 --> 27:43.166
And the Anna?

27:43.827 --> 27:45.669
Catharine Catharina.

27:45.949 --> 27:47.030
C-A-T-H?

27:47.631 --> 27:47.871
1735.

27:47.891 --> 27:51.375
1735.

27:52.196 --> 27:53.458
And how old is this map?

27:53.478 --> 27:54.839
1735 it is.

27:55.760 --> 28:02.708
So with a map that was... Made at the occasion of the disaster of these two Indian men.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.429
Indian ships, right?

28:05.449 --> 28:08.152
Indian ships, yeah, but we call it Indian men.

28:08.172 --> 28:08.873
Indian men?

28:08.893 --> 28:09.173
Yeah.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.136
M-E-M-E-N.

28:11.436 --> 28:12.497
Like men of war?

28:12.637 --> 28:13.598
Were they warpships?

28:13.718 --> 28:13.939
Yes, yes.

28:13.959 --> 28:17.443
We call them men of war, is what we call them.

28:18.284 --> 28:18.964
Was it a collision?

28:19.725 --> 28:22.809
No, it was not a collision, it was a big storm.

28:23.509 --> 28:24.911
And where did they sink?

28:24.991 --> 28:25.892
Where is this area?

28:25.932 --> 28:29.676
At the sand banks, in the mouth of the River Scheld.

28:30.517 --> 28:33.100
This is a part of the province of Sealand.

28:33.147 --> 28:40.698
And it's the entrance this day of the river Scheldt, by which a lot of ships go to Antwerp.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.984
It's in the mouth of the river Scheldt, this Belgium here.

28:45.024 --> 28:49.150
So using this map, they were able to locate the wrecks?

28:49.170 --> 28:49.951
Yes.

28:49.971 --> 29:01.467
It was in this way that they, from the sea, they took a course to the two towers of Bruges.

29:03.016 --> 29:17.433
And when they did that, they determined their position here, and then over this spot where the frequent hat was drawn.

29:18.074 --> 29:20.797
They were able to locate this.

29:20.877 --> 29:22.038
I'm a former naval officer.

29:22.058 --> 29:24.301
I had some training with the medical charge.

29:24.321 --> 29:24.882
Oh, yeah.

29:25.022 --> 29:26.884
But this is the treasure map.

29:27.745 --> 29:29.327
It's called the treasure map.

29:33.138 --> 29:59.652
Was there treasure on board the ships when they found it?

30:00.526 --> 30:12.928
These are all manuscript material, right?

30:13.088 --> 30:14.711
All manuscript material, yes.

30:16.214 --> 30:23.867
Would you say that this collection served as the national collection before there was a national collection?

30:24.455 --> 30:29.561
In 1995 it was the National Library of the Republic.

30:29.581 --> 30:35.026
We have then five universities.

30:36.168 --> 30:42.835
Leiden was the university of the most powerful province of the Republic of the Seven Provinces, Holland.

30:43.496 --> 30:46.359
So Leiden was the university of Holland.

30:46.659 --> 30:52.065
Franeker was the university of Friesland.

30:52.636 --> 30:59.225
because Holland was the most powerful province, Leiden was also the most famous university.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.007
Probably the first, too, wasn't it?

31:01.027 --> 31:02.089
Probably the first, too.

31:02.349 --> 31:07.015
And then I have to show you a picture.

31:07.336 --> 31:09.659
So this was the national collection.

31:09.699 --> 31:14.485
When there was a national library established, you still kept your collections?

31:14.505 --> 31:15.306
None of your collections?

31:15.467 --> 31:16.248
Yes.

31:16.268 --> 31:18.070
And we are aware of that, I think.

31:18.775 --> 31:28.367
that we keep here a cultural heritage of the Netherlands.

31:30.249 --> 31:32.732
This is so important to my new book, you have no idea.

31:32.752 --> 31:36.157
So, I think you have to illustrate it.

31:36.337 --> 31:37.698
Oh, that's the famous picture?

31:37.718 --> 31:38.479
That's the famous picture.

31:38.580 --> 31:41.864
I can give you also a set of these ones.

31:41.884 --> 31:43.085
This is the famous picture.

31:43.426 --> 31:43.826
This is it.

31:43.846 --> 31:44.987
This is the famous picture.

31:45.328 --> 31:46.910
Can I just touch it on the side?

31:46.970 --> 31:47.871
I promise I won't.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.333
This is a good feeling.

31:50.413 --> 31:53.096
And here you see the prospect of Constantinople.

31:54.397 --> 32:06.532
That's a fuel drawn in pen and ink, pen and wash, of 11 and a half meters of Constantinople, drawn in 1559.

32:06.572 --> 32:10.516
And you have that picture?

32:10.536 --> 32:16.103
We have still the original, but only twice a year we show it to a physicist.

32:16.927 --> 32:19.289
So this is the first or the second time?

32:21.071 --> 32:21.552
Yes.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.833
Oh, this is extraordinary.

32:25.335 --> 32:25.936
What a treat.

32:28.358 --> 32:30.260
This has been such a great trip.

32:30.320 --> 32:42.272
You have to imagine, that was on the wall of our grand library during one and a half century, from 1600 to 1750.

32:42.292 --> 32:43.534
It was on the wall.

32:43.954 --> 32:46.917
And every student here...

32:47.318 --> 32:54.631
Every scholar who came in the Lager of Leiden University saw this picture of Constantinople.

32:55.672 --> 33:00.902
So it has a tremendous influence on the iconography of the town.

33:03.526 --> 33:06.692
But it was damaged during... Well, it's 150 years.

33:06.912 --> 33:07.593
It's a long time.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.759
And when was the picture drawn, do we know?

33:12.061 --> 33:12.702
1559.

33:13.930 --> 33:19.536
This is 450 years old, this picture.

33:19.556 --> 33:19.736
Yes, yes.

33:19.756 --> 33:20.497
440 years old.

33:20.918 --> 33:26.364
And for conservation reasons, it has been cut up in 21 sheets.

33:26.384 --> 33:29.047
Notice I'm standing back, so don't worry about my pen.

33:33.572 --> 33:35.134
Can I have the sheet?

33:35.154 --> 33:38.277
There it is.

33:38.297 --> 33:38.617
There it is.

33:38.637 --> 33:40.039
This is the most left.

33:43.495 --> 33:50.161
What is amazing is that that picture shows up in that engraving over there.

33:53.103 --> 33:55.565
Do we know who did the original map?

33:55.585 --> 33:56.766
The original?

33:56.786 --> 33:59.408
Yes, the name.

33:59.809 --> 34:05.854
Okay, that's fine.

34:05.874 --> 34:06.534
You don't have to go.

34:06.635 --> 34:07.776
Don't go through the whole thing.

34:08.356 --> 34:12.139
Sheet number six with the Hagia Sophia here.

34:12.339 --> 34:13.080
Hagia Sophia.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.646
There it is.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.073
That's really something.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.896
And what is the material this is on here?

34:22.916 --> 34:23.036
Paper.

34:23.176 --> 34:23.697
It's paper.

34:25.339 --> 34:27.142
Apparently a pretty good paper, I would think.

34:27.162 --> 34:28.484
Yeah, I think so.

34:28.624 --> 34:29.906
Was it framed on the wall?

34:29.926 --> 34:32.029
I think so, it was framed on the wall.

34:32.089 --> 34:39.439
But then we bought the large library of Isaac Frosius in 1695.

34:40.027 --> 34:46.074
And then all the space in the library, all the walls were needed for new stacks.

34:46.534 --> 34:49.237
So then it disappeared from our side.

34:49.277 --> 34:54.463
It was still in the catalogs, but no one did exactly where it was.

34:55.344 --> 35:01.892
And people tried to find it back in the last century.

35:02.032 --> 35:09.240
And Mr. Bodelnienhuis was the man who said, look at the stacks of the town hall there.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.953
And there they found it, rolled.

35:13.635 --> 35:16.579
And so it was very damaged.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.622
How long had it been there now?

35:18.963 --> 35:20.485
It went from 1600 to 1750?

35:20.565 --> 35:26.633
I think it was there perhaps one century and a half.

35:26.653 --> 35:29.818
Another 150 years, waiting to be discovered again.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.021
And there it was.

35:32.401 --> 35:33.663
That's a great story.

35:33.723 --> 35:36.527
That's a great story.

35:37.013 --> 36:01.992
description of that you will find in the catalog which i will give you the dutch one thank you i'm giving a talk at the groyer club in new york in two weeks and i'm going to give a report on what i've been doing for the last couple of weeks well this is this this will get into my talk yeah yeah this little uh

36:04.182 --> 36:14.012
The largest collections on wood is from the Oriental Manuscript Department.

36:15.033 --> 36:19.838
Look at that.

36:19.858 --> 36:23.181
As you see here, but more I can't show you.

36:23.261 --> 36:24.082
It is not allowed.

36:24.262 --> 36:25.643
No, I understand.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.906
This is a manuscript on wood.

36:27.926 --> 36:29.107
On wood, yes.

36:29.127 --> 36:30.829
Now, it's Oriental.

36:31.169 --> 36:32.350
Oriental.

36:32.566 --> 36:33.687
Who brought these back?

36:33.827 --> 36:34.988
Dutch traders?

36:35.909 --> 36:40.194
I shall give you the name of my colleague.

36:44.298 --> 36:49.844
Basically, what you have here is Dutch material for the most and the large majority of materials.

36:50.464 --> 36:52.667
Or do you collect things from all over the world?

36:53.167 --> 36:56.711
This is a heritage from our old colonial history.

36:56.971 --> 36:58.172
So you collect that too?

36:58.192 --> 37:00.054
Yes, yes.

37:00.074 --> 37:00.835
Especially in the...

37:01.372 --> 37:04.416
in the Oriental manuscript department.

37:05.157 --> 37:23.744
And from the first century, from the first years of our university, there was a special accent on the study of Arabic Oriental manuscripts, and especially the Arabic department was very famous in Europe.

37:24.645 --> 37:29.252
If you want to study Arabic language, you have to go to Leiden.

37:32.050 --> 37:42.964
This is still special collections.

37:42.984 --> 37:46.788
Is that what you call it, special collections?

37:47.029 --> 37:53.256
Yes.

37:53.617 --> 37:56.320
Oh, this is huge, isn't it?

38:01.632 --> 38:04.315
That's the print.

38:04.595 --> 38:10.282
This is special collections collected in the last century of Japanese books.

38:10.302 --> 38:12.564
In the last century, so you've been very accurate.

38:12.584 --> 38:13.305
By von Siebold.

38:14.326 --> 38:25.419
Have you ever heard of the Dutchman von Siebold, who was an official of the Dutch government in Japan?

38:25.859 --> 38:26.500
Yes, okay.

38:26.620 --> 38:29.243
And there he collected a lot of things.

38:29.712 --> 38:45.531
books and maps, but it is a part of the Oriental special collections, and therefore you need my curator, my colleague curator, Oriental.

38:47.473 --> 38:49.095
That's quite an interesting binding, isn't it?

38:49.135 --> 38:49.956
Yeah, yeah.

38:51.078 --> 38:57.846
That's low on the left, and what is the other one?

39:00.695 --> 39:07.687
And that should be one, two, three, four, five, six, yeah, there's a nine volume.

39:11.193 --> 39:14.077
I saw I set a letter to Stockham.

39:14.097 --> 39:19.066
Very important collections of letters of the Dutch scholars.

39:19.086 --> 39:20.849
10,000, I think.

39:22.351 --> 39:22.912
Wow.

39:22.932 --> 39:26.398
10,000.

39:29.787 --> 39:34.292
All the various types of installers, right?

39:34.312 --> 39:34.412
Yes.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.514
We have that reclainville building.

39:35.534 --> 39:36.495
Yes.

39:36.515 --> 39:42.502
And then, during the centuries, more buildings were added to that old one.

39:43.323 --> 39:55.997
So, it was at the end of the 19th century, no, at the end of the 20th of this century, it was a large agglomeration of very different buildings.

39:56.551 --> 40:06.525
And there was a shortage of space for the books in the 60s, and then we decided to build a new one.

40:06.545 --> 40:19.364
And now, that old building with all these added parts, it was used to buy in Herbaring, Herbaring?

40:19.544 --> 40:22.288
Oh, Herbaring, yes.

40:23.028 --> 40:27.894
And now, in the future, it will be used by the board of the university.

40:29.496 --> 40:33.040
And it is at the main canal here.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.123
I can see that on my way by.

40:35.163 --> 40:51.263
Yes, if you are in front of the old academy building, of which you took a picture, then you have to go over the canal of the bridge, a little bit to the right,

40:51.580 --> 40:54.263
And then you are in front of a large building.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.025
And that is the old library.

40:56.525 --> 40:59.869
And behind that building, you see the old church.

41:00.189 --> 41:05.415
And I can walk out that way as I get my bus to go to the other thing.

41:05.435 --> 41:07.658
Do you have a plan of Leiden?

41:07.678 --> 41:08.258
Do you have a?

41:08.779 --> 41:09.560
No.

41:10.901 --> 41:11.322
No?

41:11.542 --> 41:12.022
OK.

41:13.844 --> 41:16.187
A great university library.

41:16.370 --> 41:25.780
where you formerly served as the repository for the nation in terms of... The nation, and the nation also.

41:26.661 --> 41:32.468
Do you still work closely with the National Library, or is that role largely?

41:32.608 --> 41:37.153
It's a very special situation in the Netherlands.

41:38.174 --> 41:43.560
We didn't have that National Library, only it started 20 years ago.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.841
That's all?

41:45.732 --> 41:48.877
Then it was appointed as National Library.

41:48.897 --> 41:50.699
We had a Royal Library.

41:50.819 --> 41:54.184
It was not the National Library.

41:54.204 --> 41:58.450
So... Well, you had a Royal Library prior to that, though.

41:58.471 --> 41:58.731
Yes.

41:58.751 --> 41:58.911
Yes.

41:59.512 --> 42:08.946
And now we have to ask you for the key products.

42:08.966 --> 42:13.292
...to the new situation that we had the National Library for the...

42:15.010 --> 42:21.526
The independency of all the large libraries was very great in the Netherlands.

42:22.187 --> 42:28.041
We were not adapted to a national library policy in which

42:28.308 --> 42:33.195
There was one library which has the main responsibility.

42:33.215 --> 42:34.617
So you have that now?

42:35.058 --> 42:35.779
We have that now.

42:35.879 --> 42:36.460
But that's all?

42:36.520 --> 42:39.284
15, 15 years, yes.

42:39.304 --> 42:39.785
That's all.

42:39.965 --> 42:41.968
The 1980s, basically?

42:42.088 --> 42:43.911
Yes, so, 1980.

42:44.031 --> 42:48.257
And before that, you did have a royal library.

42:48.277 --> 42:49.799
We did have a royal library.

42:49.819 --> 42:51.902
I thought that was a royal library.

42:51.922 --> 42:53.545
No, the national library.

42:53.565 --> 42:57.150
And in your view, explain the difference, if you would.

42:58.126 --> 43:03.070
We have had in the Netherlands a university library.

43:03.771 --> 43:08.475
So one of these was the University Library of Leiden.

43:08.715 --> 43:23.128
And next to that we have a big library for the learned world, which has its origin in the libraries of the Princes of Nassau.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.329
That's the Royal Library.

43:25.369 --> 43:27.171
That was the Royal Library.

43:27.623 --> 43:33.589
So that was an independent library organization.

43:33.609 --> 43:49.726
The users of that library were people in the Hague and around the Hague and also from all over the Netherlands and also from all over the world.

43:50.206 --> 43:57.073
But it hasn't at that moment a special responsibility for the total library organization.

43:58.336 --> 44:21.310
This is not special collections.

44:21.330 --> 44:21.410
Yes.

44:21.430 --> 44:21.891
Wow, this is beautiful.

44:21.911 --> 44:24.154
When did this building open?

44:24.174 --> 44:24.335
In 1983.

44:24.355 --> 44:24.976
It looks more recent than that.

44:24.996 --> 44:25.657
It's already almost 15 years old.

44:25.677 --> 44:25.777
1983.

44:25.797 --> 44:25.997
Beautiful.

44:28.306 --> 44:33.153
You can go downstairs, but I think it's the same idea.

44:33.513 --> 44:47.453
As you see, on that side, on this side, the north and south hall, and a central hall for a lending bureau, and with two elevators.

44:48.054 --> 44:50.337
You open largely to students and scholars.

44:50.757 --> 44:51.759
Yes.

44:51.939 --> 44:56.946
But you allow other people to come and use your special colleges.

44:57.247 --> 45:10.822
mainly for the scholars in Leiden and the students in Leiden, and next to that for the scholars in the Netherlands and international, especially in the special departments.

45:10.842 --> 45:15.467
We have a lot of visitors on the board.

45:15.507 --> 45:15.767
Excellent.

45:16.708 --> 45:18.850
The books are also here.

45:18.891 --> 45:20.733
That's why I asked for special collections.

45:20.753 --> 45:23.035
It looks like special collections, doesn't it?

45:24.601 --> 45:27.767
Everything here is restricted access, however.

45:27.787 --> 45:29.150
Yes, all is restricted.

45:29.170 --> 45:39.589
Actually, we have one part of this text that's open for browsing, and there we find a lot of journals.

45:40.312 --> 45:41.934
But everything has to be called for.

45:42.154 --> 45:46.118
Yes, everything here, everything has to be called for.

45:46.138 --> 45:56.047
And then these books were transported when one of the old books are asked for, called for, then it is transported to the special department upstairs.

45:56.067 --> 45:57.328
Yes, which I saw.

45:59.270 --> 46:03.214
Our book elevator, and how quickly do they... You can have a look at that.

46:05.476 --> 46:06.357
Five minutes?

46:06.377 --> 46:06.657
Five minutes?

46:07.177 --> 46:13.525
How many students here at Leiden, approximately?

46:16.249 --> 46:23.138
At this moment, I think we have 18,000.

46:23.399 --> 46:24.941
That's a good size.

46:25.441 --> 46:34.213
But as you see here, students are ready to be brought to the special department alone.

46:34.430 --> 46:37.414
and is also part of the presentation.

46:38.896 --> 46:39.898
Beautifully designed.

46:39.958 --> 46:43.563
You can see the architect had done a lot of work with libraries.

46:44.164 --> 46:51.976
Also, working this text more attractive with these colors and to make use of these materials.

46:52.737 --> 46:53.177
Beautiful.

46:54.760 --> 46:57.504
It looks like it was made with the help of librarians.

47:00.147 --> 47:02.631
What was the architect's name, do you remember?

47:04.028 --> 47:04.913
from Castile.

47:04.933 --> 47:06.161
Is he Dutch?

47:06.281 --> 47:06.865
Yes, he's Dutch.

47:07.931 --> 47:10.225
He died six years ago.
