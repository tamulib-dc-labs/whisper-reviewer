WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:05.629
It's the side three of the Bill Self-Interview.

00:05.649 --> 00:07.291
Okay, we're back to where?

00:07.311 --> 00:08.613
Pope?

00:08.953 --> 00:09.173
Right.

00:12.758 --> 00:16.102
You had said earlier... Oh, these were some of the high spots.

00:16.122 --> 00:17.303
I'll go Tom's comment.

00:17.403 --> 00:17.964
Moby Dick.

00:18.305 --> 00:18.825
Mein Kampf.

00:19.045 --> 00:19.947
Autographed.

00:19.967 --> 00:20.968
Can I see Hitler's signature?

00:21.028 --> 00:21.228
Yeah.

00:22.650 --> 00:23.591
That's Moby.

00:23.611 --> 00:24.412
That's Moby.

00:24.993 --> 00:29.498
Oh, I get it now.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.641
Pretty great.

00:31.958 --> 00:34.360
Is the Hitler's signature?

00:34.380 --> 00:36.062
I do.

00:36.082 --> 00:36.803
Lookit, that's it.

00:40.787 --> 00:45.212
You know where I got this?

00:45.912 --> 00:46.653
New David Fowler.

00:48.575 --> 00:49.416
What did you think of him?

00:50.857 --> 00:53.780
Well, we parted company over Tamerlane.

00:54.961 --> 00:55.782
That was him.

00:55.882 --> 00:56.283
That was him.

00:56.303 --> 00:58.205
I never did any more business with him.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.447
Actually, Bart was working at that time.

01:00.467 --> 01:01.408
That's when I first met him.

01:01.793 --> 01:06.838
I'll forgive him, but what's the difference?

01:06.978 --> 01:08.660
I didn't feel he acted properly.

01:09.361 --> 01:17.288
Up there on the top shelf is a rebound copy of Frankenstein, which is a book I would like to have in the original, but don't.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.492
There's some kind of interesting items over here.

01:20.532 --> 01:25.036
Here's the Austen collection.

01:25.216 --> 01:30.822
Most of my Austens have been rebound, though I do have Emma in the original board.

01:34.092 --> 01:43.808
which is great work, isn't it?

01:43.828 --> 01:56.590
These are the Brontes, I think, the professor Shirley, Jane Eyre, and so forth, Wuthering Heights.

01:57.380 --> 02:02.947
These are all George Eliot.

02:03.028 --> 02:08.875
You said earlier that you rather immodestly feel you have the finest Dickens collection in the world.

02:09.576 --> 02:14.163
I don't want to let that go without just bumping a little further on that.

02:14.743 --> 02:18.889
Let me rephrase it and say I don't know that, you know, because I don't know what other people have.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.394
I do know that we have all the major works in duplicates.

02:22.414 --> 02:25.698
In other words, I don't have one copy of Great Expectations.

02:25.798 --> 02:27.100
I have actually two copies.

02:27.788 --> 02:30.872
The same way of Oliver Twist, the same way of Pickwick.

02:30.892 --> 02:33.435
I have a very good Pickwick that belong to Kenyon.

02:33.455 --> 02:34.336
I have three Pickwicks.

02:35.558 --> 02:36.599
Two of them are really fine.

02:38.101 --> 02:41.706
I have, you know, two Tale of Two Cities, two David Connors.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.047
I have probably three or four.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.569
I must have... Yes?

02:44.589 --> 02:46.892
What about Mason up in Santa Barbara?

02:46.912 --> 02:51.538
He has... He has a terrific Pickwick collection, but they haven't... I don't think they've met Mason.

02:51.558 --> 02:52.239
I've heard of him.

02:52.259 --> 02:52.719
Yeah.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.842
Again, I specialize this now.

02:55.177 --> 02:56.759
Only in Dickens.

02:56.999 --> 02:58.781
But he has newspaper copies.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.044
That type of thing as well.

03:01.064 --> 03:06.571
And also, I think, as far as presentation copies, as I said, I have 23 or 24.

03:07.472 --> 03:14.441
I'm not absolutely sure which, but I have an awful lot of the major titles.

03:14.521 --> 03:17.484
And, as you know, presented to certain distinguished people.

03:17.544 --> 03:23.972
Now, when we say, also, when we're talking about a preeminent Dickens collection, we're also talking about printed books.

03:24.313 --> 03:24.593
Yes.

03:25.062 --> 03:28.566
When you say Dickens question, you're not including manuscripts or two.

03:28.586 --> 03:30.067
Well, I don't have a great manuscript.

03:30.087 --> 03:32.490
But I don't know how many private collectors have manuscripts.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.372
Well, I don't have a great manuscript.

03:34.392 --> 03:38.056
I have quite a few letters, which I can show you over there.

03:38.076 --> 03:38.636
No, that's fine.

03:39.317 --> 03:40.178
I have quite a few letters.

03:40.258 --> 03:53.432
I have, as you know, the complete short story of the best authority, plus a few pages of public, plus a couple of pages of partial pages of Mrs. Gamm.

03:55.083 --> 04:04.255
A few years ago, you probably know the story of the Haunted Man manuscript that the guy in New York bought Manning.

04:07.859 --> 04:09.101
It was on the market for $300,000.

04:09.261 --> 04:18.052
And it was offered to me, and I said, I'd love to have it, but I don't want to spend it for it.

04:18.072 --> 04:19.774
And I passed.

04:19.814 --> 04:23.338
Then Justin Schiller called me sometime later and said, well, we sold it.

04:23.358 --> 04:24.600
And I said, well, congratulations.

04:25.627 --> 04:32.095
Then Justin called me again later and said, it's back on the market, and would you be interested in it?

04:32.115 --> 04:33.937
And I said, no, but why is it back on the market?

04:33.997 --> 04:34.838
He said, I can't tell you.

04:35.759 --> 04:39.603
But he said, the fellow who bought it is not in a position to pay for it.

04:39.623 --> 04:42.987
It turned out the fellow who bought it was the guy that was accused of the murders in .

04:43.027 --> 04:45.570
Yes.

04:46.251 --> 04:49.575
He had acquired it, and he couldn't pay for it when he got arrested.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.550
Then it came back on the market, and I think Manning bought it.

04:52.590 --> 04:55.914
All of his stuff, you know, was going to be sold in October.

04:55.954 --> 04:57.075
He's had trouble.

04:57.095 --> 04:59.598
Do you know who he's selling with, Christie's or Sotheby's?

04:59.618 --> 05:01.240
I know, it's with Sotheby's.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.161
And this is not Speck.

05:02.181 --> 05:02.862
I mean, I know this.

05:03.002 --> 05:03.943
Dick's told me himself.

05:03.963 --> 05:05.205
I'm having lunch with him next week.

05:05.225 --> 05:08.669
I've had one interview with him, and... Too bad.

05:08.849 --> 05:12.473
Well, he, uh, he, you know, Sotheby's a lot of money.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.415
I think apparently he'd pay for it all.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.176
I don't think we have to do all that.

05:17.196 --> 05:19.478
Well, let me just show you a couple things, and then I'll be done.

05:19.859 --> 05:24.164
I do want to take a picture of the two booklets in there, because that would be kind of nice.

05:27.548 --> 05:33.135
This is a copy of Alice in Wonderland with illustrations for Arthur Rackham.

05:33.355 --> 05:33.916
Oh, Rackham.

05:33.996 --> 05:35.638
And he did the original on this.

05:35.658 --> 05:36.559
This is an original.

05:36.599 --> 05:37.500
This is like the Alice.

05:37.740 --> 05:41.285
I might like a picture of that, I think.

05:41.485 --> 05:44.048
He took the... This illustration is not in the book.

05:44.838 --> 06:07.656
to go back to the uh to briefly to the uh yes uh so this individual made an offer and so they they they turned it down

06:07.805 --> 06:09.327
And it was more than they had asked for.

06:09.647 --> 06:13.092
I mean, this doesn't happen with failed savings of those.

06:13.112 --> 06:15.395
They paid 850 for it, Ruben and Ruben.

06:15.715 --> 06:16.617
Did you know Ruben?

06:16.637 --> 06:17.438
I never knew him.

06:17.818 --> 06:20.542
At one point, you know, his name was not known to any of us.

06:20.922 --> 06:25.348
When I interviewed Ricky the British, he would tell me, you know, what the owner was.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.691
It was a big secret, you know, all of a sudden.

06:27.812 --> 06:30.275
Then we knew why, because it would make money to thought it.

06:30.415 --> 06:31.336
Yes, yes.

06:31.356 --> 06:32.518
I went through that library.

06:32.678 --> 06:34.200
In fact, I knew John Maul.

06:34.501 --> 06:37.765
When I was a boy, I was on the stage briefly with Thurston.

06:38.046 --> 06:38.346
Did you?

06:38.687 --> 06:43.393
And later, I met John Mulholland when I was in New York.

06:44.374 --> 06:45.516
So I know the library.

06:46.317 --> 06:48.099
Let's see where we want to get a book.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.261
Yeah, did you know the Countess?

06:49.962 --> 06:50.262
No.

06:52.485 --> 06:54.127
Let's find a book from Tanya.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.211
Well, let's the two together.

06:57.231 --> 06:58.753
Let's see if I missed my head.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.398
There's my head.

07:04.808 --> 07:10.794
This might be the only, you know, that's kind of nice, yeah.

07:10.814 --> 07:12.556
Is the liner right on that?

07:12.656 --> 07:14.358
Yeah, that's just fine.

07:14.398 --> 07:16.340
That's very nice.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.565
It's kind of, that's going to be a very nice picture.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.650
Bill, where is the Gad's Hill place at?

07:28.994 --> 07:30.335
It's not easy to dig out.

07:31.116 --> 07:32.217
It's down underneath, yeah.

07:32.905 --> 07:38.430
It's about all the pictures they need, basically.

07:38.450 --> 07:43.935
I think we're going to let these kind of people have their evening, Connie.

07:44.095 --> 07:46.658
I'm going to see how Connie would remind you about their bio.

07:46.898 --> 07:47.659
Okay, I'll get to you.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.561
Connie, did you hear that?

07:50.581 --> 07:52.703
My daughter, we taped that for our daughters.

07:52.883 --> 07:53.224
Oh, really?

07:53.264 --> 07:54.625
Yeah, they went berserk over it.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.806
It's a good movie.

07:55.846 --> 07:56.306
Yeah.

07:56.387 --> 07:58.649
That was marvelous.

07:59.409 --> 08:01.011
I didn't know that.

08:01.051 --> 08:02.372
That was his...

08:02.639 --> 08:05.242
That was quite a wonderful show.

08:05.382 --> 08:08.666
We're going to do a sequel, you know.

08:08.686 --> 08:09.627
She didn't realize.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.030
I'm going to go with everything to my girl.

08:12.651 --> 08:14.613
Here, let's look at this stuff.

08:14.853 --> 08:17.657
She didn't realize that you had done that.

08:17.677 --> 08:20.961
These are some original drawings.

08:21.441 --> 08:22.002
Oh, that's it.

08:22.022 --> 08:28.710
Oh, yeah, this is... These are original drawings from... This is also from Suzanne.

08:28.990 --> 08:29.811
...of Playbill.

08:30.736 --> 08:31.798
So, I'm sorry?

08:32.018 --> 08:33.721
This is also from the Susan A. Sale.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.003
These are all original drawings.

08:35.363 --> 08:36.585
That's right.

08:39.370 --> 08:43.857
Come on now, there you go.

08:43.877 --> 08:44.638
These are all originals.

08:45.159 --> 08:46.782
This was an interesting thing.

08:47.122 --> 08:49.346
Now this, Kenny and I bought this together.

08:50.868 --> 08:58.380
This was a... Oh, kind of a...

08:59.221 --> 09:02.285
How can I pass that up?

09:04.148 --> 09:28.461
This is a new song written by, I guess, Dickens, and then signed by Katherine Dickens, Annie Leach, Georgina Hogarth, your sister-in-law, Mary Dickens, Katie Dickens, John Leach, and T. Sparkle, which was Dickens' pseudonym for itself at that time.

09:28.481 --> 09:29.042
What else we got here?

09:29.866 --> 09:32.149
Original drawing from the old curiosity shop.

09:32.169 --> 09:40.259
Well, we've got, I tell you, it's endless in terms of drawing right there.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.865
That looked like it could be up there.

09:45.346 --> 09:50.232
This is an original Playbill, if I remember whether it's the one I'm thinking of.

09:51.854 --> 09:52.675
No, this isn't the one.

09:52.695 --> 09:56.700
I've got one where Dickens has written in, who played all the parts, and they're all signed.

09:57.541 --> 09:58.902
Kenyon was funny.

09:59.082 --> 10:03.086
When he had an overlapping, he collected both Quickshank and Dickens.

10:03.106 --> 10:09.211
And he said, I want you to know that anything that's... I'm putting everything that was joined.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.614
I mean, Quickshank and Dickens is part of the Dickens' collection.

10:13.175 --> 10:16.498
He's a Quickshank.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.666
He smoked a pipe like chimps.

10:25.686 --> 10:26.046
Is that it?

10:26.650 --> 10:27.511
I think that could be it.

10:27.631 --> 10:29.433
I think that could be it.

10:29.453 --> 10:34.718
This would be a good background to Sarah.

10:34.778 --> 10:38.021
Tell me what a producer does on Sarah.

10:38.742 --> 10:43.306
Well, did you conceive this idea?

10:43.326 --> 10:49.292
This is when they sold the Gantua place, Dickens' home and camp.

10:50.413 --> 10:52.915
Has the collecting ever come into your work, by the way?

10:52.935 --> 10:54.137
No, not really.

10:54.157 --> 10:55.678
Not really.

10:56.013 --> 10:58.276
This is an interesting thing, Tony.

10:58.617 --> 11:03.844
This is the... This is Gad's Hill Place, and it shows the house and guidance.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.286
Yeah, go ahead.

11:05.386 --> 11:06.167
I'm focusing.

11:07.109 --> 11:09.051
Tony can have a picture taken.

11:11.855 --> 11:12.055
Right.

11:12.116 --> 11:13.598
Sarah was... This is the house.

11:13.878 --> 11:21.368
I asked them about Sarah, just for a little... Well, Sarah was a little unique in that Glenn Close brought the project to me.

11:21.569 --> 11:24.653
What happened is that she had recorded the book

11:25.291 --> 11:27.635
on an audio tape for children.

11:27.655 --> 11:28.396
And she loved it.

11:28.416 --> 11:33.203
She went to her agent and said, do you think it could be sold as a television movie?

11:33.423 --> 11:34.104
And he said, no.

11:34.265 --> 11:35.166
It's too soft.

11:35.226 --> 11:36.849
It'll never get on a network.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.374
So the only chance she had was to sell it to an advertiser.

11:40.394 --> 11:42.177
And she said, how do we sell it to an advertiser?

11:43.399 --> 11:46.443
And the agent said, well, Bill Self has a relationship with Hallmark.

11:46.503 --> 11:48.747
I've been involved in eight or 10 Hallmarks.

11:49.848 --> 11:51.210
And so I never met her.

11:51.371 --> 11:54.075
And her agent called me and said, well, I fly to New York to meet in Flint.

11:54.095 --> 11:54.235
Thanks.

11:55.244 --> 11:58.068
Oh, yeah, this is our daughter and her two.

11:58.489 --> 12:05.719
This is our daughter, Barbara, George, her husband, Tally, and Maggie, and Glenn.

12:06.100 --> 12:13.270
So I flew to New York, and I met with Glenn, and we formed a 50-50 partnership, and so she and I owned it together.

12:13.638 --> 12:15.240
And it's a terrific thing for me.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.383
Oh, I enjoyed it so much.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.885
The children, everyone was sorry.

12:18.925 --> 12:20.567
I mean, it's the top of the floor.

12:20.587 --> 12:21.227
We recorded it.

12:21.247 --> 12:23.751
Well, we are going to, but I don't record anything.

12:23.871 --> 12:26.574
It's up for some, I think it wins some enemies.

12:26.634 --> 12:27.155
I hope so.

12:27.315 --> 12:28.477
Oh, sure.

12:28.697 --> 12:29.678
It was so moving.

12:29.758 --> 12:30.920
It was so moving.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.082
And I think it told you a lot for children today.

12:33.122 --> 12:34.644
How the people persevered.

12:34.764 --> 12:36.446
Oh, the children's responses went terrific.

12:37.328 --> 12:38.990
You know why Hallmark got it?

12:39.010 --> 12:39.470
It's a funny thing.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.514
I never thought of it when they were, uh,

12:42.950 --> 12:48.355
when I presented it to the Hallmark people, what they liked about it, it was a good stepmother.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.478
They said, there aren't many stories about good stepmothers.

12:51.498 --> 12:54.060
There are a lot of stepmothers in the world, and a lot of them are aligned.

12:54.561 --> 12:56.263
And they said, this is a good stepmother.

12:56.323 --> 13:00.487
Well, just the typical story of the stepmother is she's always evil.

13:00.587 --> 13:00.987
Yeah.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.008
You know?

13:02.028 --> 13:03.349
She was wonderful.

13:04.210 --> 13:10.716
I'm trying to acquire for Hallmark, a book quite like Sarah, in a way, called The Education of Little Tree.

13:10.856 --> 13:11.657
You know what I mean?

13:11.890 --> 13:17.937
It's a book, Little Tree is an Indian boy who is raised by his grandparents.

13:17.957 --> 13:23.023
And they are uneducated and everything else, but they have great wisdom and love and understanding and everything else.

13:23.523 --> 13:24.484
It's a wonderful book.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.927
It had just great reviews.

13:27.388 --> 13:31.032
And there must be seven or eight people trying to buy actual movies.

13:31.052 --> 13:33.294
I'm trying to get it, and Hallmark is backing me.

13:33.314 --> 13:34.796
They're putting up the money.

13:34.816 --> 13:36.418
And so I hope together.

13:38.801 --> 13:40.383
Did you come to Hollywood as an actor?

13:40.523 --> 13:40.783
Yeah.

13:41.607 --> 13:45.473
I was in about 35 movies, something like that.

13:45.773 --> 13:53.965
Well, I'll show you something kind of interesting, since you were a photographer.

13:54.045 --> 13:56.709
We looked for a painting there that we could afford, couldn't find one.

13:57.811 --> 14:04.881
And finally, Peggy had the idea of taking a, that's a 35mm shot that I did at Monet's house.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.137
I was going to say, it looks like a Monet.

14:07.217 --> 14:08.399
We hid it at Monet's house.

14:08.659 --> 14:09.800
And Peggy blew it up.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.441
What's that?

14:10.461 --> 14:13.124
I promised Connie a poster.

14:13.144 --> 14:13.785
Do you have one?

14:13.805 --> 14:15.366
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:15.386 --> 14:16.247
For the children?

14:16.267 --> 14:16.768
This is ours.

14:16.788 --> 14:18.229
We had framed it.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.252
That would be wonderful.

14:20.272 --> 14:21.934
Would you sign it?

14:21.954 --> 14:23.716
Oh, sure.

14:25.017 --> 14:28.361
These posters, I have sent a few out to kids here.

14:28.441 --> 14:29.442
See, this is the same picture.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.926
This is the picture of the poster.

14:32.946 --> 14:34.868
But this was some...

14:36.097 --> 14:39.301
This is what Hallmark... Yeah, that's the press kit.

14:39.321 --> 14:41.844
We got that at... One of the, you know, press cuts.

14:42.505 --> 14:52.998
See, but it's just... And this... This was in a late... Self-styled company.

14:53.318 --> 14:54.900
Well, this is the slide.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.083
This is our son that produced it.

14:58.204 --> 15:02.650
And Bill and Barbara Farbray have taken the slide when they split it.

15:02.690 --> 15:05.513
I just want to write down... Do you want to get a copy of that?

15:05.695 --> 15:06.596
That's May 25th.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.818
That's not hard to remember.

15:07.858 --> 15:08.239
That's my birth.

15:08.319 --> 15:08.980
26th.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.302
Sunday, May 26th.

15:10.382 --> 15:12.304
The Dayton News.

15:12.384 --> 15:13.406
This year or last year?

15:13.786 --> 15:14.507
This year.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.369
May 26th.

15:15.389 --> 15:15.529
1991.

15:15.549 --> 15:15.789
1991.

15:18.213 --> 15:21.678
Dayton News.

15:21.778 --> 15:25.643
I've got to write him a note.

15:25.743 --> 15:26.004
Thanks.

15:26.024 --> 15:26.765
And on the back.

15:27.606 --> 15:32.533
They were very thoughtful and put the continuation on the back of the same page.

15:32.633 --> 15:32.913
Okay.

15:33.014 --> 15:34.015
I'll call him in.

15:34.417 --> 15:46.203
We stopped watching TV after these after we don't see these any longer.

15:46.564 --> 15:47.947
The M.A.S.H.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.475
series, my God.

15:51.596 --> 15:52.257
Eleni?

15:52.642 --> 15:59.232
Nick Cage is a very close personal friend of ours.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.414
I said North Grafton.

16:00.434 --> 16:02.097
We live about a half a mile from each other.

16:02.117 --> 16:02.878
We know him very well.

16:02.898 --> 16:03.739
We were in Greece.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.162
We were in Spain with him.

16:05.362 --> 16:09.489
And then we were also East when they had a premiere back then.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.011
So we know Nick a little bit.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.615
Nick and Joan, I just showed him two days ago.

16:14.316 --> 16:18.683
That was such a nice story.

16:19.642 --> 16:25.249
Our daughter, this is her third article.

16:26.771 --> 16:35.682
When they were doing Sarah, she was visiting, so she took a picture of the windmill and wrote the article.

16:35.702 --> 16:46.375
And her little 14-year-old, they used a picture, a snapshot of the house, and they gave her credit back in the article.

16:46.456 --> 16:52.247
It was quite a nice one.
