WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:04.804
Okay.

00:04.864 --> 00:08.327
We're sitting in the rain outside the Allen Memorial Medical Library.

00:09.027 --> 00:10.609
We're in Cleveland proper now?

00:10.969 --> 00:11.590
Yeah.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.350
Yeah, this is Cleveland.

00:12.811 --> 00:16.995
And it's on the University Circle on Case Western Reserve University campus.

00:17.996 --> 00:21.719
This library was built in 1926 and dedicated by Harvey Cushing.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.040
Harvey.

00:23.180 --> 00:26.423
The famous neurosurgeon from Harvard and Yale.

00:27.645 --> 00:32.569
And that was a Cleveland family, so it was appropriate that he was brought back to do that.

00:33.663 --> 00:43.296
But the library was built to provide reading materials of the same quality that physicians in Europe had to Cleveland practicing physicians.

00:44.097 --> 00:47.882
So this is a practicing physician library.

00:47.902 --> 00:51.547
It's now a national landmark and a Cleveland landmark.

00:51.567 --> 00:56.554
And it has a collection that starts in about 1475 and goes forward from that.

00:57.495 --> 01:01.881
It has a very unusual herbal collection, one of the finest in the world.

01:02.671 --> 01:03.993
It has a Darwin collection.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.955
It was a very unusual Freud collection.

01:07.276 --> 01:18.849
And it has a lot of other materials, including a number of books from the collection of Nicholas Pohl, who was the P.O.L.

01:19.550 --> 01:31.144
Nicholas Pohl was the physician to Maximilian I of Austria and followed him around on his various travels and carried his books in his saddlebags.

01:31.204 --> 01:31.564
We have

01:32.236 --> 01:33.017
There are a few of those books.

01:33.578 --> 01:35.760
They're spread around the world, but we have, I think, six.

01:37.582 --> 01:39.364
And that's what this library is all about.

01:39.424 --> 01:41.747
It's a practicing physician library.

01:41.767 --> 01:48.014
And, of course, I'm sure it's been added, too, by private people, by individuals.

01:48.114 --> 01:57.585
A lot of gifts from individuals, very extensive practicing medicine collection, which we try to maintain with all the economic uncertainties and that.

01:58.139 --> 02:02.243
But it's a library that physicians walk into and behave differently.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.206
And you see this?

02:05.226 --> 02:05.546
Oh, yeah.

02:05.766 --> 02:06.507
You can notice it.

02:06.567 --> 02:09.550
And our theft rate is different here than it is in the other library.

02:11.252 --> 02:16.497
Well, how do you mean they behave differently?

02:16.617 --> 02:21.462
There's a willingness to say that I'm in a great institution and a great library, and I'm going to behave.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.225
You don't get graffiti.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.847
You don't get banalisms.

02:28.008 --> 02:31.953
behavior that's obstreperous or unfortunate.

02:32.875 --> 02:36.039
But would you get that from physicians and other libraries?

02:36.059 --> 02:36.340
Oh, yeah.

02:36.740 --> 02:40.846
Because of the natural arrogance of the species.

02:40.926 --> 02:41.627
Pretty much.

02:41.647 --> 02:44.271
They steal journal articles and all that kind of stuff.

02:44.291 --> 02:45.973
You know, Tom Wolfe said the right stuff.

02:45.993 --> 02:52.362
The only people who can compare to fighter pilots who talk to his inscriptions, you know, in terms of arrogance.

02:52.843 --> 02:54.084
He's got it.

02:54.104 --> 02:55.446
He's got it down pat.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.007
Thanks again.

02:56.324 --> 03:01.590
Well, there's an argument going on in the library profession, and in fact it's going on in our whole society.

03:02.491 --> 03:06.355
With the computer access to information... I have a whole chapter on this.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.696
People are very concerned.

03:07.736 --> 03:16.846
And I maintain that if we're careful about it, and as sophisticated as we need to be, the computer helps you find things.

03:17.026 --> 03:19.169
It does not separate the need for the thing.

03:19.189 --> 03:24.154
Meaning the artifact, the...

03:24.472 --> 03:26.675
Because you can't sit there and read on a screen.

03:26.955 --> 03:28.497
I don't know anybody who's read a book.

03:28.517 --> 03:32.922
Do you know a single person who's read a book, page one, the end on a computer screen?

03:32.943 --> 03:33.483
I don't know.

03:33.503 --> 03:34.284
Drives you crazy?

03:38.349 --> 03:44.697
I think what's going to happen is, and we're already seeing it in book purchases, as I'm sure you've documented already.

03:46.499 --> 03:48.241
You look at the bookstores in Cleveland.

03:48.262 --> 03:52.707
When I came here in 66, there were essentially...

03:53.648 --> 03:54.649
About four bookstores.

03:56.251 --> 04:01.178
And then suddenly, a few years back, it just took off.

04:01.198 --> 04:07.026
I was coming back from seeing Peter Kosgloff, who was a book collector and book dealer in Cleveland, quite a famous one.

04:07.126 --> 04:08.968
He was the one who built Hugo Robert's collection.

04:08.989 --> 04:11.292
Yes, it was with Hugo yesterday.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.874
Hugo's a trip.

04:13.014 --> 04:13.675
He's great fun.

04:14.215 --> 04:23.588
But I was coming back at 9 o'clock at night on a Saturday, and I came by a Barnes & Noble bookstore out in an area where you don't think books.

04:24.277 --> 04:26.099
It's coming in from Hugo's place.

04:27.861 --> 04:33.948
And I decided that I had to go in and see if they had a particular book I was looking for, so I could hardly get through the place.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.371
There were hundreds of people in there.

04:36.391 --> 04:39.355
Nine o'clock on a Saturday night in a bookstore in Cleveland, Ohio.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.396
That's exciting, isn't it?

04:40.416 --> 04:41.137
It's astonishing.

04:41.157 --> 04:41.537
It's great.

04:41.838 --> 04:45.382
I always just spent eight days on the West Coast.

04:45.602 --> 04:46.643
Say again.

04:46.663 --> 04:47.104
Lou.

04:47.805 --> 04:48.025
No.

04:48.105 --> 04:48.786
The one from New York.

04:49.446 --> 04:49.947
Kroos.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.713
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll start again.

04:51.953 --> 04:52.333
Krause?

04:52.814 --> 04:59.784
Krause, well, Krause is dead, but Mary Ann Foulter, his daughter, Mary Ann Krause Foulter.

05:00.565 --> 05:02.227
I want to know everybody.

05:02.688 --> 05:10.419
There's a guy who came out with a really, at first, outrageous statement.

05:10.439 --> 05:11.761
What if I take some of these things?

05:12.542 --> 05:17.689
The more I thought about it, the more attention I gave to it, the more reasonable it sounded.

05:19.762 --> 05:22.146
I always say he's a very young man because he looks very young.

05:22.166 --> 05:23.769
There's a guy named Alan Kay.

05:24.110 --> 05:25.252
Don't know him.

05:25.272 --> 05:25.392
K-A-Y.

05:26.414 --> 05:30.320
He's the guy who developed the mouse on the computer.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.063
He's a genius.

05:33.285 --> 05:37.633
He came out of the University of Utah with a degree in something like romance language.

05:37.653 --> 05:40.718
He turns out to be the best computer guy in the entire world.

05:41.319 --> 05:43.423
From a computer standpoint, as a

05:44.078 --> 05:49.005
user and thinker on it, he makes Gates look like a corporate executive, which he is.

05:49.165 --> 06:10.133
But Alan Kay, who is the chief scientist at Apple Corporation, gave a talk at the Educom conference in Stanford years ago and stood up and said, if you want students in elementary school, secondary school, to learn about computers and how to use them, have them put on a play.

06:11.635 --> 06:11.895
Jesus Christ.

06:11.915 --> 06:13.157
I said... Oh, that's right.

06:13.930 --> 06:22.609
He said, if you're going to put on a play, you've got to do it in such a way that it's exactly what you need to do to make use of the computer.

06:22.629 --> 06:23.952
This guy is something else.

06:23.972 --> 06:24.935
Where is he now?

06:24.955 --> 06:26.719
He's chief scientist at the Apple Corporation.

06:26.739 --> 06:27.400
And where are they?

06:27.532 --> 06:29.794
Cupertino, California, I think.

06:29.814 --> 06:32.277
That means I've got to go back to California.

06:32.297 --> 06:35.901
Tell me about some of these things that we're walking by.

06:37.503 --> 06:38.324
I'm in your hands, sir.

06:38.364 --> 06:42.448
Please tell me your full name and rank in serial harm at all.

06:42.468 --> 06:49.155
My name is Jeff Martin, and I'm a book librarian and activist here at the Cleveland Medical Library Association.

06:50.036 --> 06:52.839
And I was just going to show you around a little bit.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.902
I've got a couple of things that I've pulled for you.

06:54.942 --> 06:57.184
Of course, some of these you may already have seen.

06:57.603 --> 07:00.086
And I'm happy to answer any questions or whatever.

07:00.247 --> 07:04.252
Why don't you just start and we'll let the questions take care of themselves.

07:04.272 --> 07:05.213
Okay, very good, very good.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.835
Well, did you want to sit or you want to take a look?

07:06.855 --> 07:07.596
I mean, it's up to you.

07:07.656 --> 07:08.337
Why don't you show me?

07:08.658 --> 07:09.219
Okay, fine.

07:09.579 --> 07:12.183
Well, we have an awful lot of collections here.

07:12.243 --> 07:14.706
This room is a fairly new room.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.348
We're very proud of it.

07:16.749 --> 07:19.012
But we had had some problems a while back.

07:19.072 --> 07:23.578
I don't know if Mr. Cheshire has mentioned it, but we actually had a flood at one point in time.

07:23.598 --> 07:26.682
So all this has been refurbished and quite nicely done.

07:27.100 --> 07:34.133
The majority of the things that are in this room are fairly important collections, but they're not everything.

07:34.173 --> 07:38.542
We have a total of maybe 50,000 to 60,000 volumes.

07:38.562 --> 07:42.770
I'm also in charge of the archives, and that's approximately 500 linear feet.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.114
Is this the reading room as well?

07:45.335 --> 07:46.577
Yes, this is the reading room.

07:46.793 --> 07:47.974
Compact, to be sure.

07:48.255 --> 07:48.955
Yes.

07:48.975 --> 07:58.306
We also have another room that we tend to use for other people called the Corlette Room, which is a room on the other side I can show you, which is dedicated to the study of venereology and syphilology.

07:58.466 --> 07:59.067
Okay.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.069
So somebody's got to study it.

08:01.169 --> 08:02.431
It's amusing, yes.

08:02.451 --> 08:04.213
Well, it's also amusing to sit someone on the high.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.517
We got you very much sitting in our syphilis room for this.

08:07.877 --> 08:09.719
But anyway, I can show you a couple of the collections.

08:09.739 --> 08:15.906
Obviously, you see Sigmund Freud here and our iconic pictures of Darwin.

08:16.173 --> 08:22.923
We have a very strong collection of Darwin and Sigmund Freud.

08:22.943 --> 08:27.009
These are the Freud things, but what I guess I would point out... Are they first editions or...?

08:27.029 --> 08:31.916
Many of them are, although we do have mixtures of things in here, things that relate.

08:32.237 --> 08:35.762
So an instance like the Schilder book, I'm sure, has some relation.

08:36.143 --> 08:43.834
Some of these books, the ones I know to see the book labels makes people faint, but some of these books actually do...

08:44.152 --> 08:48.999
So the ones that are, I mean, obviously I wrote this from the 1960s, we're not going to keep it in here.

08:49.379 --> 08:51.041
But we have an awful lot of first editions.

08:51.522 --> 08:59.353
We do have some strength in terms of actually collecting in other languages outside of German and English.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.095
So we try and collect whatever.

09:01.876 --> 09:12.471
One of the main ways that this material came in, both the Freud and the Darwin, is that Mr. Stecker, who, actually Dr. Stecker, excuse me, was

09:12.839 --> 09:16.142
one of the physicians, librarians associated with the collection.

09:16.242 --> 09:17.543
How do you spell his name?

09:18.004 --> 09:20.446
S-T-E-C-H-E-R.

09:21.487 --> 09:23.288
And he was instrumental in starting this.

09:23.328 --> 09:24.850
And we've had this collection.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.512
We've been building it for a long period of time.

09:28.133 --> 09:32.597
The Cleveland Medical Library Association itself has been in existence for over 100 years.

09:33.177 --> 09:38.062
So the richness of the collection is kind of due to all the different physicians.

09:38.082 --> 09:40.464
Tell me, you don't mind my asking a few questions?

09:40.524 --> 09:40.784
Sure.

09:40.804 --> 09:41.785
Go right ahead.

09:41.805 --> 09:41.985
Go ahead.

09:42.623 --> 09:47.768
Obviously, this is here to serve the medical community?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.411
Or the larger community of researchers out there, sure.

09:50.431 --> 09:50.691
Okay.

09:52.933 --> 09:57.337
Is it for medical students primarily or practicing physicians?

09:57.918 --> 09:59.940
I would say it's really for almost anyone.

10:00.040 --> 10:12.192
We do particularly teach classes for the medical students on history of medicine, and they're welcome to use these materials, although I've had inquiries from other people who are associated with different departments.

10:12.593 --> 10:19.280
For instance, there is a history of nutrition class that's offered, and that woman always has come over here and look at some different things.

10:20.922 --> 10:27.989
But usually, it's mostly Case Western people, but I get calls from different parts of the country, actually different parts of the world.

10:28.690 --> 10:31.493
Well, I guess that kind of leads to the next question.

10:31.533 --> 10:35.877
What is here that they can't get in different parts of the world?

10:35.957 --> 10:40.542
Well, many times people are looking for, I think,

10:41.399 --> 10:44.164
It seems to me many times people are looking for archival sorts of things.

10:44.244 --> 10:48.171
We're very, very atypical kinds of works.

10:48.191 --> 10:49.393
We have a very strong collection.

10:49.513 --> 10:57.006
Obviously, the Darwin and the Freud are not as highly used by people outside.

10:57.026 --> 11:00.893
Now, this starts getting into the Darwin, and you'll see it is very extensive.

11:01.109 --> 11:04.955
Over here, of course, we have all the different versions of our species.

11:04.975 --> 11:07.378
Of course, Darwin isn't necessarily medical either.

11:07.478 --> 11:08.220
Well, that's true.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.304
It's biological, and that's why we're kind of a little bit larger.

11:11.324 --> 11:13.547
Again, I'm just showing you the extent.

11:13.627 --> 11:15.250
But now these are printed books we're talking about.

11:15.270 --> 11:16.071
Yes, that's right.

11:16.131 --> 11:18.094
We're not talking about... I just saw something drip.

11:18.114 --> 11:19.136
No, I didn't either.

11:19.236 --> 11:21.679
No, that was... Okay, yeah.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.180
Okay.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.126
No, it was this right here.

11:26.146 --> 11:30.032
That scared me when I saw... I hate that.

11:30.152 --> 11:30.913
It's that white stuff.

11:31.450 --> 11:35.757
But we do have people that are interested in more unusual items.

11:35.797 --> 11:40.544
Our materials go all the way back to the incanabula era.

11:40.745 --> 11:52.242
We have, in fact, the contents of approximately 50% of the contents of a physician who was extant in the late 15th century.

11:52.263 --> 11:53.545
His name was Nicholas Pohl.

11:53.565 --> 11:54.526
I can show you that here.

11:54.546 --> 11:57.711
I don't know if you've ever heard the name Harvey Cushing, the famous

11:58.568 --> 12:00.090
a famous neurosurgeon.

12:00.110 --> 12:04.537
He was originally from Cleveland, but he actually is enshrined in Yale.

12:04.597 --> 12:06.861
He was in Yale for many, many years, but he helped.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.265
He was one of the people who was influential in getting this.

12:09.285 --> 12:10.927
Was it incunable here?

12:10.967 --> 12:11.228
Yes.

12:11.488 --> 12:15.254
They're not all incunables that are here, but a large number.

12:15.714 --> 12:16.396
Yes, that's right.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.440
I think we have over 40 incunables.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.642
There are a couple of herbals.

12:20.702 --> 12:22.725
You see, actually, there's been a book written on pole.

12:23.286 --> 12:24.508
This is not only in

12:25.484 --> 12:26.605
Bibliography.

12:26.645 --> 12:27.126
Oh, sure.

12:28.127 --> 12:29.628
You can send this.

12:30.990 --> 12:32.051
I mean, the bibliography.

12:32.091 --> 12:32.431
Send this.

12:32.831 --> 12:37.836
I've got 50 tapes on behind to transcribe it.

12:37.856 --> 12:41.480
Now, this book is pretty widely available, I believe.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.502
Go ahead and let you just talk to me about that.

12:43.522 --> 12:44.123
Yeah, that's all right.

12:44.143 --> 12:44.844
I don't want to, yeah.

12:45.804 --> 12:54.293
But anyway, so the Paul collection is pretty important because a lot of the books, because they are incunables, or they're just early books, period,

12:54.695 --> 12:59.081
They have many different peculiar things related to them.

12:59.701 --> 13:18.326
I often use this collection in terms of a book art, sort of an educational way, and oftentimes the first year students who come over here for their introduction to the museum and the library are rather stunned to be able to view something that's, you know, a printed work that's 500 years old.

13:19.427 --> 13:20.989
It's amazing, isn't it?

13:21.053 --> 13:32.487
It is, especially for the medical students, because for most of them, anything that's been published in the last 10 years is fine, but previous to that, it's as if the knowledge was unimportant.

13:32.507 --> 13:38.814
And then for them suddenly to realize that they can hold a book in their hands that's 500 years old is quite outstanding.

13:40.376 --> 13:49.187
The Paul Collection, interestingly enough, is not studied as a whole, but I believe that there are sometimes inquiries for different sorts of things, whether it's

13:49.623 --> 13:52.307
The bindings, as you've seen, some of them are rather nice.

13:52.968 --> 13:56.494
I wouldn't be surprised, too, if there have been different book arts-related questions.

13:57.395 --> 14:02.764
And again, I would say we have approximately 50% of his library.

14:03.245 --> 14:10.136
And it's rather odd, as you probably realize, to have the allergies.

14:10.376 --> 14:11.778
Well, of course, rare books, too.

14:11.878 --> 14:13.802
It's not a professional hazard.

14:13.962 --> 14:16.626
But it's very unusual.

14:16.876 --> 14:22.364
to have that much of any person's library from that period of time.

14:22.824 --> 14:23.765
So we feel very honored.

14:23.785 --> 14:26.409
And this came basically from the fellow?

14:26.429 --> 14:28.352
It was purchased.

14:28.372 --> 14:36.843
And the Cushing family was a longtime resident of Cleveland, and Harvey Cushing was one of the people involved.

14:36.863 --> 14:41.770
There were also several other Cushings that were doctors that were related, that were in town.

14:42.003 --> 14:43.546
This collection is pretty highly used.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.088
What are some of the high spots in here?

14:45.389 --> 15:00.435
Oh, there are a lot of different things, but one thing that I just want to show you, kind of jumping the gun here, but I think these are not the original ties, obviously, but this is something I like to show to the students because it kind of ties in with things that they study.

15:00.455 --> 15:03.961
This is Fracastoro's work on syphilis.

15:04.683 --> 15:07.167
He is the inventor of the term.

15:07.484 --> 15:08.225
Is that right?

15:08.245 --> 15:09.005
Yeah.

15:09.025 --> 15:09.426
What is it?

15:09.446 --> 15:11.267
What are words?

15:11.428 --> 15:17.253
Syphilis is actually, this is done, as per usual in medicine, these things have very, very strange things.

15:17.273 --> 15:18.734
It's done at first, right?

15:18.754 --> 15:22.478
Well, it's actually the story of a shepherd named Syphilis.

15:22.958 --> 15:26.301
And Syphilis outrages the sun god by not doing the appropriate worship.

15:26.321 --> 15:27.402
Like Thomas Baudelaire.

15:27.462 --> 15:28.603
Yeah, that's right.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.664
And he gave his name.

15:31.005 --> 15:36.090
And so he is enshrined, and this person is enshrined as a

15:36.644 --> 15:38.226
the name of this horrible disease.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.908
Although, of course, syphilis was not used as the disease term.

15:40.928 --> 15:47.234
So this is the publication where it's... Yes, that was the first work on syphilis.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.816
It actually named it syphilis.

15:48.856 --> 15:51.578
There were other things before that had discussed it.

15:55.983 --> 15:58.445
Is there... How do I enter this?

15:58.505 --> 15:59.566
I'm really interested.

16:00.187 --> 16:01.088
So I'm back on again.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.491
I guess what I would say that makes it special is

16:04.893 --> 16:06.355
is the depth of the material.

16:06.515 --> 16:15.969
I think that the doctors who established the Cleveland Medical Library Association were pretty much bibliophiles themselves.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.212
At that period of time, I think most people were.

16:18.232 --> 16:19.634
Well, that's interesting.

16:19.654 --> 16:28.447
In fact, just as a historical note, the first book that was actually given, the first book of the library, is Vesalius.

16:29.568 --> 16:33.634
So the 1555, which I have sitting over there if you'd like to do homage,

16:34.002 --> 16:41.511
But there was a very, very great concern on the part of most of the doctors here to actually create a rich collection.

16:41.551 --> 16:51.043
And as a result, we have a collection that kind of spans many, many different areas and have an awful lot of depth going all the way back, all the way present.

16:52.105 --> 17:00.255
Something just like as a modern note, we have many different editions of, you know, all the different editions that we can possibly find of works.

17:00.615 --> 17:03.739
So I've had a couple of historians who've come in who've been doing fairly

17:04.242 --> 17:10.693
fairly late 19th century, early 20th century work who've been able to find every edition that they needed because everything has been kept.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.176
That's how we are here.

17:12.196 --> 17:19.008
Can you think of a couple of titles that just spring to mind where that might be the case?

17:19.028 --> 17:22.214
Well, you know, probably the best example is Osler.

17:22.534 --> 17:26.060
We have all the Osler editions, which is of course important.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.583
We also have the

17:27.783 --> 17:28.764
The first printing.

17:28.864 --> 17:29.825
How many?

17:29.845 --> 17:31.967
I think it's like 15 editions, something like that.

17:32.168 --> 17:35.431
There were a number of other ones after that where he was not involved.

17:35.451 --> 17:35.992
How many years?

17:36.813 --> 17:42.419
It was approximately, I think his book reigned for maybe, I would say, 40 years, 50 years maybe.

17:42.799 --> 17:46.383
And so what is really significant in the succeeding?

17:46.403 --> 17:49.186
And not specifically, but why is it necessary?

17:49.706 --> 17:54.111
Well, it's necessary to see the evolution of the conception of illnesses, especially as the

17:54.293 --> 18:00.544
19th century turned into the 20th century, and there was this very large laboratory evolution in medicine, right?

18:00.604 --> 18:04.811
All of a sudden, things were becoming much more codified by doing experiments and all the rest of it.

18:05.252 --> 18:18.435
So, Osler's book is very interesting because he was truly a clinician, much more than an experimentalist, but his approach even to the clinical diagnosis of things changes over time, so it's nice to document that.

18:18.475 --> 18:19.457
Sure.

18:19.741 --> 18:22.244
And as I said, we have different editions of many things.

18:22.304 --> 18:27.371
Even like in the 19th century, we have multiple editions of various texts that have come out.

18:27.431 --> 18:30.996
We have a very strong syphalology, veneerology collection.

18:31.837 --> 18:34.240
How did that happy smile every day you say that?

18:34.260 --> 18:36.363
How did that happen here?

18:36.383 --> 18:36.864
I don't know.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.386
There was just an interest.

18:38.406 --> 18:42.111
There was Dr. Corlett, who I believe the association was associated with him.

18:42.952 --> 18:46.677
And I don't know if they were all his books or whether he happened to advocate there.

18:46.943 --> 18:47.904
They're being purchased.

18:48.185 --> 18:49.226
That happens so often.

18:49.266 --> 18:58.961
Somebody gives a remarkable collection, and you become the authority overnight, especially if it's somehow pertinent to what you're doing, and this is clearly pertinent.

18:59.101 --> 19:05.490
Also, as a footnote to my own career, the last place that I worked at had a major dermatology, venereology collection.

19:06.412 --> 19:12.320
That was in Southern Illinois University, not in Carbondale, but the medical school in Springfield, Illinois.

19:12.641 --> 19:14.824
So I've had a fairly strong dose.

19:15.344 --> 19:19.851
of syphilis exposure.

19:22.875 --> 19:37.857
But at any rate, the books are also marvelous because not only is there... I find this material very interesting because the syphilis material kind of mimics... The history of syphilis is kind of being reshaped when you look at AIDS.

19:37.877 --> 19:44.507
And a lot of the issues that have gone on in the history of syphilis are being recapitulated, which is interesting.

19:44.791 --> 19:46.353
Well, let me ask you.

19:46.373 --> 19:47.836
This is something I thought of, you know.

19:48.557 --> 19:51.942
People are asking me, what can you collect these days?

19:52.022 --> 19:54.466
It isn't already... There's all kinds of things.

19:54.526 --> 20:01.757
I would think that anybody alert enough to put together a collection on the history of AIDS, starting with the first use of the word.

20:02.438 --> 20:05.162
That to me would be the...

20:05.497 --> 20:08.260
That would be a very valuable document, wouldn't it?

20:08.280 --> 20:12.985
Well, off the record, okay, I will tell you that we actually have something like the works.

20:13.005 --> 20:13.986
Well, why would you tell me that off the record?

20:14.006 --> 20:19.491
Well, because it's not formulated yet totally, so I don't want to, like, out to the public that Cleveland... This book's not been published for three years.

20:19.651 --> 20:27.379
Well, but what we've got in the works is we're working with some other people here over in Western Reserve, the Historical Society.

20:27.419 --> 20:28.921
I'll check back with you on this.

20:28.941 --> 20:34.086
Sure, and what we're trying to do is we're trying to delimit a project on AIDS

20:34.437 --> 20:40.143
And AIDS has been studied a lot in the East Coast and also out in San Francisco.

20:40.284 --> 20:42.206
But in terms of America, it tends to be bipolar.

20:42.246 --> 20:44.909
It tends to be East Coast or West Coast.

20:44.929 --> 20:49.915
So what we're doing is we're trying to say, how can we document this in other parts of the country?

20:51.236 --> 20:53.098
And what should be studied and what should be held on to?

20:53.459 --> 20:57.163
With just the same idea that many of these things are maybe ephemeral.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.404
They're being lost.

20:58.785 --> 20:59.145
That's right.

20:59.699 --> 21:02.262
So we have to go out there and work on it.

21:02.382 --> 21:09.750
Do you have an individual like yourself that's kind of... That's what we're going to.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.273
We're going to go toward that.

21:12.293 --> 21:15.517
Somebody has to say, we have to define what we're after.

21:15.577 --> 21:27.090
I would think that what would be very interesting, which you probably would not want to include in such a collection, but which I think, as a bibliophile and a chronicler of the history of this, is also all the...

21:28.083 --> 21:30.347
books that have been written about it.

21:31.349 --> 21:34.975
The novels, for instance, the fiction, the poetry, the wonderful poetry.

21:35.396 --> 21:42.529
The guy won the National Book Critics' Circle Award with a moving poem about his lover who died of AIDS.

21:42.749 --> 21:45.374
I would definitely want to see that in such a collection.

21:45.735 --> 21:46.997
I'd want to see the memoirs.

21:48.419 --> 21:49.922
Would this kind of material

21:50.881 --> 21:54.527
be considered for inclusion in such a collection at a medical school?

21:54.627 --> 21:56.951
Chances are that could be included.

21:56.971 --> 22:04.823
That, to me, would almost be the mark of greatness in the collection, to go outside and to really make it very comprehensive.

22:05.544 --> 22:11.634
Well, you know, most medical school collections, too, any of the good rare book collections, we tend to go into literature, for instance.

22:11.654 --> 22:13.176
I mean, oftentimes when I'm upstairs,

22:13.409 --> 22:20.821
I giggle because I've got a copy of, we've got Gulliver's Travels and we've got, you know, obviously Defoe's Plague Years and things like that.

22:21.181 --> 22:28.853
But it's interesting because there's always been an interest in doctors and literature and especially physicians as literatures.

22:28.893 --> 22:33.200
So there really is here then a very strong intellectual interest.

22:34.462 --> 22:36.144
It's not clinical.

22:36.525 --> 22:37.486
Oh, no, not at all.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.488
And in fact, I think this,

22:38.890 --> 22:50.087
I think that this collection is very, very flexible because one could conceivably come in and look at things in a very clinical vein and get that information, and yet there are many other ways to look at the collection.

22:50.167 --> 22:54.754
So, again, it would depend upon the scholar's viewpoint.

22:55.295 --> 23:00.763
We have very strong collection of different anatomical works, for instance.

23:01.098 --> 23:02.400
and the anatomical works.

23:02.420 --> 23:07.647
We even have people come over from the Cleveland Institute of Art because, again, the overlap is just enormous.

23:07.727 --> 23:09.650
I'm going to make a prediction on my take.

23:09.670 --> 23:21.387
Here it is, October 9, 1996, that you are going to put together this great collection on the literature of these, but it is largely going to be the stuff that it should be, the clinical stuff.

23:21.407 --> 23:29.198
But somebody else out there, you don't even know, and I don't even know who this person is, is going to gather all those novels and all the memoirs and all the poetry.

23:29.617 --> 23:34.306
And somehow this person is going to hear about your collection, and you're going to get that collection.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.049
And maybe 20 years from now.

23:36.430 --> 23:37.993
But that's how the dynamic works.

23:38.053 --> 23:38.373
Exactly.

23:38.634 --> 23:39.075
Exactly.

23:39.115 --> 23:39.876
That would be wonderful.

23:40.237 --> 23:40.738
That would be wonderful.

23:40.758 --> 23:41.078
You know?

23:42.140 --> 23:44.304
You and I are formulating this right now.

23:44.324 --> 23:50.676
But I wouldn't... What happens to collectors is that they have to... I see where I'm coming from.

23:50.736 --> 23:51.838
I couldn't agree with you more.

23:51.918 --> 23:52.720
Yeah.

23:52.740 --> 23:52.840
Yeah.

23:53.174 --> 23:57.460
So we are looking for other things like that.

23:57.540 --> 24:10.417
What I told our Medical History Society recently is that I'm trying to continue with the things that we've done in the past, bringing those strands into the future, and also to see what areas we might start to collect in.

24:11.098 --> 24:21.291
One thing that I always think of as an area, and now we're not doing this, but something that I thought is very critical is a lot of the early works on DNA, for instance.

24:21.592 --> 24:24.255
That work was done in the late 40s and the early 50s.

24:24.715 --> 24:26.617
In my neck of the woods, too.

24:26.637 --> 24:27.178
Uh-huh.

24:27.278 --> 24:31.483
At the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, believe it or not.

24:31.503 --> 24:32.324
That's right.

24:32.524 --> 24:38.070
But I would be willing to tell you that most of the copies that we have of different... Give a pencil.

24:38.090 --> 24:38.570
Yeah.

24:38.731 --> 24:40.152
Whenever we're on this stuff.

24:40.172 --> 24:41.514
Ah, yes, I understand.

24:41.534 --> 24:42.154
You're well trained.

24:42.174 --> 24:42.495
Thanks.

24:42.795 --> 24:49.202
But I would venture to guess that most places that actually have

24:49.486 --> 25:00.220
these different early works on the development of, you know, research on DNA, actually those works are probably falling to smithereens or have been purloined already or whatever.

25:00.781 --> 25:09.232
So, like, for instance, what would a pristine copy of the molecular biology of the gene look like?

25:10.153 --> 25:16.962
And, you know, again, in 20 years, probably you're not going to be able to find any of them because, again, they've all been used to death or whatever.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.543
That, to me, is an area that needs to be collected.

25:19.723 --> 25:26.352
I think it's outside of our purview here, but I think it would be interesting for someone to collect.

25:26.653 --> 25:27.955
This is spectacular, yeah.

25:27.995 --> 25:28.576
Isn't it wonderful?

25:28.896 --> 25:29.557
Yeah, Verona.

25:30.879 --> 25:33.142
What are the numerals?

25:33.162 --> 25:38.730
M, G, X, X, X. So what... 15, 1530.

25:38.750 --> 25:38.950
Wow.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.173
It's an old name.

25:41.554 --> 25:44.097
Well, then I have... The one thing I must show you, then,

25:45.899 --> 25:48.883
Because this is, I always tell the students, this is the whole memorial.

25:52.347 --> 25:54.771
And we're very proud of this.

25:54.911 --> 25:58.455
This is Vesalius.

25:59.076 --> 26:00.899
This is not the original finding.

26:00.939 --> 26:01.760
This is pretty good.

26:01.780 --> 26:06.266
We had a full-time conservator here who was probably one of the best, I think, in the country.

26:06.486 --> 26:09.470
I did not know him myself, but he's very well known.

26:09.510 --> 26:10.551
His name was Swoboda.

26:11.793 --> 26:15.838
And he actually went down, I think, to University of Texas at Austin.

26:16.274 --> 26:21.961
But anyway, I'm sure as soon as you see the top of the title page, you've seen this before.

26:22.061 --> 26:24.785
Well, I've seen Haskell Normans, which is colored.

26:24.805 --> 26:28.730
Oh, but this, I mean, we're just excited because when we have... Well, this is marvelous.

26:28.850 --> 26:30.692
But that is his great book.

26:30.772 --> 26:34.897
Every notable collection is defined by at least one great book.

26:35.138 --> 26:35.398
Exactly.

26:35.418 --> 26:37.761
And his great book, in his view, is his Vesalius.

26:38.442 --> 26:41.726
Well, this is our number one book, like I said, in the first edition to the library.

26:41.746 --> 26:42.467
So I think that...

26:42.869 --> 26:45.713
So the collection basically started with this.

26:46.394 --> 26:47.615
What a way to start.

26:47.635 --> 26:48.576
I know.

26:49.217 --> 26:53.263
But it must be a pretty, the binding must be pretty old.

26:53.323 --> 26:56.967
I mean, it's... Now, I don't know very much about the construction of it.

26:56.987 --> 26:58.309
I'm sure it's documented.

26:58.329 --> 27:01.854
And the rare book librarian who was here before me, of course, would know.

27:03.256 --> 27:06.380
You can tell now that the work was quite well done.

27:06.460 --> 27:10.245
I know that Jan was very highly thought of in the field.

27:10.265 --> 27:12.808
So this is not even, this is not the first edition, because the

27:13.312 --> 27:21.886
It was 1543, but I believe this was considered the more accurate, perhaps, edition, because that happens in medical technology.

27:21.906 --> 27:25.972
Yeah, well, in my book, everybody is bonkers about getting the first edition.

27:26.092 --> 27:26.373
Great.

27:26.493 --> 27:31.400
The edition of Florence Nightingale, I believe, had a larger printing run.

27:31.701 --> 27:39.133
So, actually, the second edition or second printing was smaller, so that's the one that people who are collectors actually collect.

27:39.153 --> 27:39.874
Isn't that interesting?

27:39.894 --> 27:39.994
Yeah.

27:40.295 --> 27:41.597
I read that somewhere.

27:41.617 --> 27:42.638
Well, that's good.

27:42.658 --> 27:43.960
I'm writing two books, by the way.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.605
One is just going to be on collecting, and then it'll come after this next one.

27:47.785 --> 27:54.314
And this was at the behest of my publisher, but little items like that are things I love to get, I'm looking for.

27:54.474 --> 27:56.336
I'll go right in the database when I get home.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.780
I pick that up somewhere.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.445
Well, this is your great book, the Vesalius, the first great book.

28:02.465 --> 28:03.366
Yes, that's right.

28:03.967 --> 28:08.272
And it's a 1555, I think you said.

28:08.332 --> 28:08.593
That's right.

28:08.613 --> 28:08.713
Okay.

28:08.733 --> 28:08.833
Okay.

28:09.303 --> 28:10.124
Yeah, well, you should be.

28:10.384 --> 28:10.885
It's wonderful.

28:11.926 --> 28:13.308
And did you want to show me around?

28:13.368 --> 28:15.030
Or did you want to show me some of these others?

28:15.150 --> 28:21.619
Why don't you close this up for us before you... Well, I'll close this in the same way.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.841
Well, I don't mind holding it open a few minutes.

28:23.921 --> 28:27.366
I don't, you know, but I wouldn't want to keep it in that position for my time.

28:27.486 --> 28:29.829
My feeling is go ahead and we've seen it.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.231
It's actually funny, though.

28:31.511 --> 28:35.496
I am a curator, truly, but what I tend to do is I tend to...

28:35.965 --> 28:38.528
to err on the other side of showing people things.

28:38.548 --> 28:41.531
And I know a lot of people say, well, how can you show things?

28:41.971 --> 28:44.814
Yeah, but this is not just a story you have.

28:45.875 --> 28:48.578
These folks are here to be used.

28:48.758 --> 28:55.786
We have to understand about it.

28:57.087 --> 28:58.108
Elizabeth Blackwell.

28:58.128 --> 29:03.053
This is not Elizabeth Blackwell, who was the first female physician

29:07.572 --> 29:11.276
Bob mentioned something about the herbal collection.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.578
We have a collection of over 200 herbals.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.781
There haven't actually been a publication on it.

29:16.201 --> 29:18.023
So it's extensive.

29:18.063 --> 29:21.527
It goes all the way to the very early, very early 16th century.

29:21.547 --> 29:24.871
We've got them large format.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.012
Whichever one you want.

29:26.052 --> 29:27.413
Diascordi's, all the rest.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.997
But I was going to show you this because this is from the whole collection.

29:31.538 --> 29:32.459
Again, the Kittables.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.683
And what's nice about, let me put up Elizabeth here.

29:36.703 --> 29:37.444
She's okay.

29:38.318 --> 29:45.010
And again, these are the ones that I actually show for medical students, so I try to make them happy.

29:46.413 --> 29:52.123
This is that annotation by Nicholas Pohl, so you really do have... Oh, that's who that is.

29:52.303 --> 29:53.025
Isn't that wonderful?

29:53.365 --> 29:53.485
Yeah.

29:53.506 --> 29:55.629
It's kind of, you know, one of those eerie things.

29:55.689 --> 29:59.476
It's Nicholas Pohl, Doctor, 1494.

29:59.977 --> 30:00.458
Wow!

30:01.540 --> 30:01.881
You know?

30:02.482 --> 30:02.622
Mm-hmm.

30:03.496 --> 30:05.319
Columbus has barely set foot.

30:05.339 --> 30:05.819
I know.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.162
I always tell the students that, too.

30:08.182 --> 30:08.723
Wow.

30:09.004 --> 30:10.025
And what is this up here?

30:10.045 --> 30:11.106
Is that also in his hand?

30:11.207 --> 30:11.988
I believe it is.

30:12.168 --> 30:20.740
I can't read all of this, and some of this is obviously described in the actual text, so if you get hold of the other text.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.143
And which book is this that has this?

30:23.223 --> 30:26.988
This is Johannes de Ketham, T-K-E-T-H-A-M.

30:27.028 --> 30:28.390
Look at the condition here.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.672
And this is actually...

30:30.091 --> 30:37.440
The first evidence, the first use of didactic medical woodcuts.

30:38.562 --> 30:41.185
And what I always point out... Did the title once more, though?

30:41.566 --> 30:44.129
No, no, no, actually not, because I think that was it.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.512
What is it called?

30:46.532 --> 30:48.655
Is that the insipid, I guess you could say?

30:48.675 --> 30:54.382
Because so many times with these books, they didn't have... The title page was not yet caught, you know, all that.

30:54.643 --> 30:56.605
So that's probably the best that we have.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.842
What is it called again?

30:58.962 --> 31:00.324
I can get the exact title.

31:00.344 --> 31:10.177
But what did you, how did you... I usually refer to it as, well, his name is Johannes de Ketham, and it's usually called fasciculus medicinae, I believe.

31:10.237 --> 31:13.001
There are different versions of it, and I can get the exact name here.

31:13.582 --> 31:17.868
But I was just going to show you, again, these are very well-known woodcuts.

31:18.469 --> 31:22.474
And one of the wonderful things here is that there are different sections that talk, if you...

31:22.690 --> 31:23.371
Look closely.

31:23.411 --> 31:24.974
I think the first word is probably veina.

31:25.175 --> 31:29.764
This is a veina section diagram of where to bleed people.

31:31.126 --> 31:37.358
And there are pictures of how an actual anatomy was performed, and that I always

31:37.557 --> 31:39.199
I love the marginalia, of course.

31:39.219 --> 31:41.342
And this is Paul's marginalia.

31:41.362 --> 31:45.769
As far as I know, as far as I know, I haven't been able, like I said, to study it.

31:45.789 --> 31:49.815
Do you also have the full provenance of this book?

31:49.855 --> 31:51.577
Do you know whose hands it passed?

31:51.657 --> 31:55.102
I believe most of that, again, is documented in the book.

31:55.603 --> 31:58.067
See, that's fantastic.

31:58.087 --> 32:05.337
I'm going to have something on Owen Gingrich, you know, who's trying to find, determine every owner of every first and second

32:05.857 --> 32:08.500
extant edition of Copernicus.

32:08.600 --> 32:08.780
Wow.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.761
That's interesting.

32:09.781 --> 32:10.402
That's amazing.

32:10.422 --> 32:18.530
Because I'm really interested in how the books influence lives, and if you can document it, you know, this is pretty interesting.

32:18.550 --> 32:21.192
Of course, that's an astrological connection there.

32:21.212 --> 32:21.833
That's wonderful.

32:22.414 --> 32:25.637
The condition of this is spectacular.

32:25.857 --> 32:35.847
I had a class, I went to rare book school, and I had a class in paper, and paper making, and

32:36.147 --> 32:41.692
I don't know if you've ever heard the name Tim Barrett, but he's at the University of Iowa.

32:41.832 --> 32:43.194
He is amazing.

32:43.214 --> 32:48.238
He's a wonderful person, but he's also a very, very well-known scholar in terms of papermaking.

32:48.619 --> 32:56.827
One of his most famous books is called, oh, I'm going to get it confused, but he did the definitive work on Japanese papermaking.

32:57.687 --> 33:02.032
He's a very well-known paper scholar, in addition to being an actual papermaker.

33:02.312 --> 33:05.715
He's an artist and also a historian, done a lot of work on preservation.

33:06.067 --> 33:12.899
But he used to talk about books, and he'd say, you can look at any incunable book and look at the paper, and the paper is vibrant.

33:12.919 --> 33:13.360
And it's true.

33:13.380 --> 33:16.285
You look at the paper, and you just say, this is an amazing paper.

33:16.626 --> 33:21.976
And then you look at something from the 50s that is turning green by now.

33:22.817 --> 33:30.471
The other thing that's very interesting for most, I think the students usually get a kick out of this, is that this is actually a chart on urine.

33:31.733 --> 33:33.735
Are these vials?

33:33.755 --> 33:34.396
Yes, that's right.

33:34.516 --> 33:41.525
And what used to happen in the late Middle Ages, early Renaissance times, is that that was how diagnosis was done.

33:41.605 --> 33:46.070
So you collected urine, and then you analyzed color and sediment and stuff like that.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.273
So they really were analyzing urine that early?

33:48.293 --> 33:50.375
Well, but in the sense of looking at it.

33:50.455 --> 33:51.537
In a rudimentary fashion, of course.

33:51.557 --> 33:52.718
That's right, that's right.

33:52.738 --> 33:53.840
But that's what I always tell people.

33:53.900 --> 34:00.087
It's like this is very similar in terms of they actually use that thing that we still use to diagnose certain illnesses,

34:00.370 --> 34:04.275
And, of course, this all ties in, if you look at the name sanguine and cholergic and all the rest of it.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.280
This has to do with the four humors, you know, black, bile, all of this.

34:08.300 --> 34:09.482
Sanguine, sanguineous.

34:09.502 --> 34:10.623
Yeah, which is this word here?

34:11.525 --> 34:13.747
This is choleric.

34:13.768 --> 34:15.269
You know, sometimes it's C-H-O-L-E-R-I-C.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.172
Choleric?

34:17.192 --> 34:17.913
Right.

34:18.093 --> 34:18.834
Phlegmatic?

34:18.874 --> 34:21.017
Phlegmatic, exactly.

34:21.037 --> 34:28.707
And the balance of the humors, all of this, of course, goes all the way back to Galenic medicine, you know, the different balances of the humor and

34:29.058 --> 34:29.739
how you treat them.

34:29.759 --> 34:33.003
So this is basically a diagnostic chart of this thing.

34:33.664 --> 34:37.128
I mean, even just the initials are just wonderful.

34:37.729 --> 34:39.972
Where was this book printed, did you say?

34:40.452 --> 34:43.657
I'd have to look it up.

34:43.697 --> 34:44.578
Go to the colophon.

34:44.598 --> 34:45.619
Maybe it's in the colophon.

34:45.639 --> 34:46.180
Sure, though.

34:46.340 --> 34:48.062
I don't remember if there was a colophon, though.

34:48.302 --> 34:50.345
There's also a wonderful index.

34:51.086 --> 34:51.887
Look at that.

34:53.709 --> 34:54.250
I know.

34:54.310 --> 34:56.313
That's a handwritten index.

34:56.633 --> 34:57.154
That's right.

34:57.174 --> 34:58.255
Do you think you folded that?

34:58.538 --> 34:59.319
I'm not sure.

34:59.379 --> 35:00.861
Again, it's probably in the book.

35:00.941 --> 35:02.704
I don't know all the details.

35:02.724 --> 35:03.685
I always have to apologize.

35:03.705 --> 35:12.617
So this book is the book that this person used to... Well, I mean, obviously, his name is, you know, it's like you're talking provenance.

35:12.637 --> 35:16.182
It's like, well, we have, this is the smoking gun that it was polled book.

35:16.222 --> 35:21.609
So I'm assuming, especially with all of this work, that obviously, you know, look at those annotations.

35:21.669 --> 35:21.909
Wow.

35:22.030 --> 35:25.715
You know that this person had to have looked at this book and said, well, phlegmatic.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.258
I'll look it up on, you know, page 24 or whatever.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.702
I can't find you the exact publication.

35:31.902 --> 35:34.244
That's in that book.

35:34.264 --> 35:36.487
I'm going to have to reference that book anyway, so don't bother.

35:36.527 --> 35:43.293
Anything I do in this is going to require my getting that book, which is easily accessible to me.

35:43.573 --> 35:50.760
The other thing is, I think that this is one of these situations where this is a bound-with situation.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.802
There are three different books here, essentially.

35:52.822 --> 35:54.063
What do they call them?

35:54.143 --> 35:55.765
No, that's different volumes.

35:56.200 --> 36:04.253
I often refer to them as boundless, but they're basically, they're not, they used to call them triple-deckers, too, when they were novels in the 19th century.

36:04.570 --> 36:09.136
but there are different works that will... They call them Reader's Digest condensed books, right?

36:11.260 --> 36:15.045
Well, I don't know what Johannes de Kepha would be in condensed versions.

36:15.546 --> 36:18.670
But anyway, that is truly a work that I enjoy.

36:18.690 --> 36:19.912
Well, that's central.

36:20.593 --> 36:32.029
I'll show you one other small thing, just to show you again how... You know, personally, I mean, you may consider the Vesalius the Holy of Holies, but for my money... Well, you see, this is... There are others of these...

36:32.482 --> 36:34.084
Other people have these.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.005
This is pretty special.

36:35.386 --> 36:37.409
Well, there are a number of Kevins out there.

36:37.969 --> 36:39.872
Yeah, but with the stuff that's in there.

36:39.892 --> 36:43.437
Well, yeah, but you see, I think that's why the Paul collection is so magnificent.

36:43.457 --> 36:47.662
And part of the problem with getting people to study the Paul collection, though, is that think of what you have to know.

36:47.682 --> 36:52.569
I always tell people, I tell the students that, well, if you knew Latin, you could read this.

36:52.909 --> 37:00.379
But that's really not true, because it would require not only that you knew Latin, but that you, of course, understood the historical aspect of all this,

37:00.730 --> 37:02.532
And you understood the medicine of the time.

37:03.013 --> 37:08.880
So this material, there's a lot of rude stuff there, but it requires a scholar who has all those different strands.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.282
You have to come prepared.

37:10.682 --> 37:11.343
Exactly.

37:11.403 --> 37:15.047
So you have to have done many years of homework.

37:15.067 --> 37:18.492
So you don't allow idle examination of these?

37:18.712 --> 37:24.539
Oh, if someone came in and said, I would like to see, I've had some people come off the street and say, hi, I heard that you had Darwin.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.043
I'll pull Darwin off as long as they're not going to drop coffee on it.

37:28.524 --> 37:29.505
I don't have a problem with that.

37:29.722 --> 37:32.166
Most people do not come and ask for your honesty.

37:32.186 --> 37:32.687
They don't know.

37:32.727 --> 37:33.308
They don't know.

37:33.788 --> 37:34.870
I didn't know until today.

37:37.795 --> 37:39.798
That's the whole beauty of this book business.

37:39.858 --> 37:48.352
I've been talking to a history professor here who teaches on the history of science and technology, and I was marveling over this one book.

37:48.372 --> 37:49.433
This is much later.

37:49.914 --> 37:50.836
I mean, this is so old.

37:50.876 --> 37:54.902
This is a 1745 book, but it's by a man named Dagote.

37:55.304 --> 37:59.428
What I always find curious is that the development of medical illustration.

38:00.770 --> 38:09.900
Now this, again, this is not the type of piece that, you know, is one of a kind, but it really is just an absolutely stunning work.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.562
I believe this is copper press.

38:12.603 --> 38:16.207
I'm not that good on illustration processes, but... Wow.

38:17.668 --> 38:20.952
And there's a... How about when is this?

38:20.972 --> 38:23.995
Again, mid-18th century.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.368
But there's a, let's see if I can find it.

38:26.388 --> 38:27.830
So these are all hand colored, you think?

38:29.032 --> 38:35.720
No, I think that this is actually copper, color, copper print, copper plain etching.

38:35.740 --> 38:36.140
Wow.

38:36.561 --> 38:42.188
So, and what I find curious is that when you look at some of the standard... I mean, it's pre-lithography.

38:42.608 --> 38:46.833
Well, also, it's very, I always think of it as being very modern, the way it works.

38:46.853 --> 38:53.982
Look at the, and look at how... I didn't know you could pull stuff with a press that earlier, with these different colors, but I guess you could.

38:54.687 --> 39:03.361
Well, again, I don't know all of the ins and outs about it, but again, not only the colors, but also the preservation of it all, it seems like it's a thing for that.

39:04.563 --> 39:05.404
Look at the detail.

39:05.604 --> 39:06.165
Exactly.

39:06.205 --> 39:11.654
There are two prints, and I can never find them when I want to.

39:11.694 --> 39:15.500
There's a very exotic print of a woman.

39:18.905 --> 39:19.446
Oh, is it both?

39:20.641 --> 39:22.943
That's a fairly famous illustration from this work.

39:22.963 --> 39:27.588
And what I always find peculiar is that if you cut it off right here, the face is fine.

39:27.669 --> 39:28.369
It's a work of art.

39:28.389 --> 39:30.972
And then you realize all of a sudden, oh, well, she's been flayed.

39:30.992 --> 39:32.634
Look, he's flayed her.

39:32.694 --> 39:32.914
Yeah.

39:32.934 --> 39:33.335
That's right.

39:33.355 --> 39:33.815
Who is this?

39:33.955 --> 39:34.596
Do you know?

39:34.656 --> 39:35.977
His name is Dagote.

39:36.038 --> 39:36.818
I can give you a name.

39:36.838 --> 39:38.220
Dagote.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.202
Let me get you the exact citation.

39:41.143 --> 39:42.404
Dagote.

39:42.424 --> 39:42.925
Dagote.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.947
Is this the scholar or the artist?

39:44.967 --> 39:45.788
Yeah.

39:45.953 --> 40:01.214
The artists, but you've got to remember too, a lot of these, like when we say Vesalius and all that, many times I always think of it almost like an editor-in-chief because then what happens is they have someone actually execute the different prints or woodcuts.

40:01.234 --> 40:07.363
Same thing happened with Vesalius, because Vesalius didn't actually do all of the etchings himself.

40:07.403 --> 40:11.168
I think it was von Kalkar who did them, who was a student of T.
