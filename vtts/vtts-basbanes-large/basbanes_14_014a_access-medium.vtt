WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:04.600
Just one, two, just, just, just, just.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.702
We just started the other one.

00:07.004 --> 00:13.914
Why don't you just, can you just do what you just said once more?

00:13.995 --> 00:25.492
Well, America has this great ambition to be loved by our own slave, with us in America.

00:25.512 --> 00:30.460
And it's a very laudable strength, but we have the

00:30.440 --> 00:52.074
certainly misinterpreted America for my time as a country somewhat less than only interested in a new typewriter.

00:52.094 --> 00:55.519
But it was, of course, years and years ago

00:55.499 --> 01:05.892
But we didn't take America in the field of athletics quite as serious as we should have.

01:06.835 --> 01:09.323
It's quite remarkable.

01:09.623 --> 01:12.848
the Morgan Library, the Smithsonian.

01:13.409 --> 01:19.858
So it was founded or made possible by an Englishman.

01:20.539 --> 01:26.769
It's something that is unique in the world and unique in the field of culture.

01:27.310 --> 01:34.180
Even the Louvre or the British Museum cannot compare

01:34.531 --> 01:41.487
in intellectual display with the Smithsonian Institute,

01:41.939 --> 01:47.547
with the museums and the history of art.

01:47.627 --> 01:54.738
Do you think it's uniquely a 20th century institution, even though it's 150 years old?

01:54.758 --> 01:56.059
Yeah, very naturally.

01:56.180 --> 01:59.945
It has been developed only since the beginning of the century.

02:00.486 --> 02:08.858
When you look at the focus on the kinds of things that are preserved, I think that you know Roger Kennedy, you remember Roger Kennedy,

02:08.838 --> 02:10.202
No, no, no.

02:11.104 --> 02:14.012
By no means they'll come.

02:14.172 --> 02:15.356
This is just terrible.

02:15.857 --> 02:17.201
No, that shouldn't be.

02:17.261 --> 02:18.043
I did it.

02:18.404 --> 02:19.607
No way you didn't.

02:19.891 --> 02:21.935
Maybe we can come back.

02:21.955 --> 02:22.697
Maybe we can see you again.

02:22.717 --> 02:25.062
Well, you must come back soon.

02:25.142 --> 02:25.603
Thank you.

02:26.785 --> 02:28.268
Thank you.

02:28.569 --> 02:30.633
That is a wonderful thing to have an invitation.

02:31.595 --> 02:34.060
Because I think we've worn you out today.

02:34.481 --> 02:36.465
Well, no, it was a great pleasure.

02:38.489 --> 02:41.275
After all, he has all this...

02:41.525 --> 02:44.951
yearning and talking about ourselves.

02:44.971 --> 02:47.795
It's not a very laudable human quality.

02:47.815 --> 02:50.460
No, no, we're not.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.623
I'm pleased to my wife.

02:52.643 --> 02:54.066
She's in charge.

02:54.126 --> 02:55.448
Yes, how lucky you are.

02:59.254 --> 03:01.899
The pleasure is ours, Dr. McClendon.

03:01.919 --> 03:05.845
No, I feel privileged.

03:06.179 --> 03:11.968
I hope you will come back and be some other little adventure.

03:11.988 --> 03:12.369
Thank you.

03:12.389 --> 03:15.794
You're welcome.

03:15.814 --> 03:16.876
But it is interesting.

03:17.357 --> 03:26.110
I remember hearing Roger Kennedy and asking him about... See, one of the criticisms of the University of Texas is that they try to get everything.

03:26.131 --> 03:29.296
It's just the opposite of Rato Bedman who throws things away.

03:29.616 --> 03:30.918
They throw nothing away.

03:31.138 --> 03:33.362
They would keep scraps of paper like this.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.043
They would keep...

03:34.276 --> 03:46.914
anything, and I think the Smithsonian in many ways does that, because Kennedy says, in order to understand the masterpiece... Have a nice afternoon, everybody.

03:46.994 --> 03:51.440
Thank you.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.275
There's always something...

04:05.275 --> 04:31.082
Did you find most of these pictures yourself through your own research?

04:31.102 --> 04:31.182
Yes.

04:31.668 --> 04:36.672
I had this enormous state library at my disposal.

04:36.692 --> 04:46.081
But it's simply an American, the sideline, the accessibility to books is so marvelous here.

04:46.101 --> 04:56.249
When we went to the state library, Prussian state library, it's really probably comfortable to the Harvard Library.

04:56.269 --> 05:00.493
If you want to have a certain book, you have to order it.

05:00.929 --> 05:08.304
the day before, then come back the next day, and then you had it.

05:08.324 --> 05:15.880
But this free access to books is something so marvelous that Americans just feel not appreciated enough.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.786
They think it has always been so.

05:18.867 --> 05:23.954
I was very surprised to read in your book that they didn't allow you to take the books home.

05:23.974 --> 05:27.098
No, very little, very little.

05:27.419 --> 05:32.646
When I did some work at the Bibliothèque Nationale, I mean, you have to, it's the same thing.

05:32.686 --> 05:37.974
You sit down, and it really is, and if you get a seat, it's a big deal.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.437
If they give you a place at this table,

05:40.703 --> 05:44.367
And this is a very, you're considered a big shot.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.208
To get in already.

05:45.308 --> 05:47.811
That's right, yeah.

05:47.871 --> 05:51.155
It was a lot easier to get a reader's pass at the British Library.

05:51.275 --> 05:53.577
That was pretty good, I must say.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.880
But they are very particular.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.122
Thank you, thank you.

05:59.123 --> 06:03.408
Anyway, I wonder whether this is really essential.

06:03.428 --> 06:06.812
You had really enough of this.

06:07.383 --> 06:11.850
That's the actual moment.

06:11.870 --> 06:15.176
We already looked at the first assignment.

06:16.718 --> 06:24.711
You're going back the other way now.

06:24.731 --> 06:27.515
You see there's something.

06:27.535 --> 06:28.216
I took a lot of them out.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.180
I love that.

06:31.301 --> 06:33.525
Now what is this that you just put there?

06:35.952 --> 06:39.255
We had this already.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.017
Could you go back to that?

06:42.599 --> 06:43.159
Yeah.

06:44.401 --> 06:46.443
This is where they're going to burn the books, right?

06:46.463 --> 06:46.883
Yeah, right.

06:46.963 --> 06:51.968
They came to the library and took it out.

06:51.988 --> 06:57.374
I want to use one of these pictures in my next book of the Germans destroying the books.

06:58.154 --> 07:03.380
I think it's very important to show the atmosphere that was building up.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.761
Yeah, right.

07:05.365 --> 07:13.036
There they are, right there.

07:13.137 --> 07:18.445
So proud of what they're doing here.

07:18.465 --> 07:34.849
And then I showed you how I got into business in getting a little more commercial in finding old pictures which apply to modern commercial products.

07:35.808 --> 07:42.438
And that's the man who... What is that one, Doctor?

07:42.458 --> 07:49.628
This one I sold to a man who made powder, anti-itching powder.

07:49.969 --> 08:01.846
And there was a famous lord in England who established hitching posts for his shepherds so they could sketch themselves.

08:01.947 --> 08:05.612
And every time they did, they'd say,

08:06.132 --> 08:30.621
God bless the Lord of our God, you know.

08:30.641 --> 08:32.663
And then this thing with sex education is nothing new, something that hypocrites discuss very freely.

08:33.773 --> 08:49.870
Only during the Middle Ages, you know, we lost so much of the free thinking of the antiquity.

08:49.890 --> 08:51.073
The ancients were really quite open-minded about sex, about

08:51.965 --> 08:54.488
They're intimate different selves.

08:54.508 --> 08:59.434
See, what we have to understand is that you're doing this before the invention of the copying machine.

08:59.694 --> 09:13.270
You're going in with your camera and finding these pictures, but because nobody could come in with a Xerox machine, you are doing the research, too, and finding them, and when you discover them, you take a photograph of them, right?

09:13.290 --> 09:14.131
Yeah, yeah, certainly.

09:14.172 --> 09:16.654
This is pre-Xerox machines.

09:16.695 --> 09:17.656
Now, this is what?

09:18.176 --> 09:21.280
I don't know whether it's my book.

09:21.682 --> 09:35.602
I mean, how things sit out so new, well, it has to be a great task.

09:35.622 --> 09:41.451
It gives you a more historical perspective.

09:41.471 --> 09:44.375
Well, then, how I came to America.

09:44.395 --> 09:44.756
Oh, that's famous.

09:44.776 --> 09:44.876
Yeah.

09:44.896 --> 09:48.381
America was very picture-minded from the very beginning, and doing things faster, doing things more efficiently, and...

09:49.019 --> 10:02.259
So the whole nation could really partake in this enormous forward drive towards the West.

10:02.279 --> 10:08.808
People were very picture hungry in the olden days.

10:08.829 --> 10:09.490
America had already facilities.

10:09.510 --> 10:13.976
People could make a living by simply selling pictures.

10:13.996 --> 10:14.537
It was something quite new.

10:15.125 --> 10:22.462
And then an enormous backlog of magazines that was weekly.

10:22.482 --> 10:25.730
You could pick up those numbers before you said a whole year's worth, about five dollars?

10:25.750 --> 10:29.118
Yeah, something, yeah.

10:29.259 --> 10:32.847
And then you cut them apart and instead of having...

10:33.063 --> 10:35.966
from a logical view of its subject.

10:36.086 --> 10:42.613
Because most of it are through a day.

10:42.914 --> 10:49.041
There probably a hundred days.

10:49.721 --> 10:52.765
In my own books, but there's really not much.

10:52.785 --> 10:57.670
I really wanted you to come.

11:01.042 --> 11:09.273
a blacksmith, a normal blacksmith who couldn't keep his mind of books.

11:09.293 --> 11:13.099
He was in a library in his forge.

11:16.103 --> 11:20.809
And then people who got inspiration.

11:20.829 --> 11:24.634
It's not new in the world, in a way.

11:24.654 --> 11:30.222
It's very happening, seeing, but it applies.

11:30.674 --> 11:48.323
People think skyscrapers are new, people always dreamt about it.

11:48.343 --> 11:50.166
You get how this applies.

11:50.186 --> 11:54.353
In New York, and it was about four or five weeks ago, these things that I had shown Edward Soverell, isn't that his name?

11:55.362 --> 12:10.300
I think he had a similar style.

12:10.321 --> 12:17.710
I'm sure he was inspired by these old pictures.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.732
The last thing that has been sort of my basic picture.

12:19.752 --> 12:21.494
That's the one that you're hearing me in the wall.

12:21.514 --> 12:23.237
You have all this and the snapper wanted something.

12:23.257 --> 12:24.458
It gives their drinks or something.

12:24.674 --> 12:25.676
Hmm?

12:25.696 --> 12:27.621
Yeah, you saw them this?

12:27.641 --> 12:30.507
Yeah, there's a telepline in there.

12:30.527 --> 12:36.160
And now they're using it even for other flavors.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.207
Anyway, and then this sale to cows.

12:40.587 --> 12:43.070
But you have all seen that already.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.713
How did you get rights to these photographs, right?

12:45.733 --> 12:48.476
How did you get the rights to these photographs?

12:48.496 --> 12:50.859
These are already in the new period.

12:51.039 --> 12:52.701
Oh, this is the UPI pictures?

12:52.721 --> 12:56.085
Yeah, these are already.

12:56.105 --> 12:56.225
I see.

12:56.245 --> 12:59.409
I wanted to ask you, you have seen this.

12:59.929 --> 13:04.815
This is, you know, what I'm going to treat you with.

13:04.835 --> 13:07.358
Let me see.

13:07.378 --> 13:09.480
I wanted to ask you whether you...

13:09.815 --> 13:11.659
You have these books here.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.703
You mentioned this book here.

13:14.143 --> 13:20.796
Of course, these things about the bookmen in general are old hats for you.

13:20.817 --> 13:22.560
Yes, this is a whole book Jackson.

13:22.620 --> 13:23.682
Yes, I have this.

13:23.802 --> 13:24.684
You have this book.

13:24.704 --> 13:25.726
Yes, thank you, however.

13:25.826 --> 13:27.129
That's a wonderful book.

13:28.371 --> 13:29.373
This I don't have.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.317
I don't know this one.

13:31.803 --> 13:32.524
I don't know.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.026
It's written by a writer.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.189
I don't think you need it.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.292
That's inscribed to you.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.856
This is a book that's inscribed to me.

13:40.876 --> 13:42.999
But do you have this book about cows?

13:44.702 --> 13:45.903
Yes, I do have that.

13:46.244 --> 13:47.606
Well, you have everything.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.849
I can give you everything.

13:49.969 --> 13:51.772
I don't have that, but I'm going to get that.

13:52.393 --> 13:53.634
I know that book.

13:53.654 --> 13:55.497
That's a new book from Crown, I think.

13:56.238 --> 13:57.660
This is from, you watch.

13:58.461 --> 13:59.683
No, not Crown.

14:00.541 --> 14:05.609
I think it is from... Look at this beautiful illustration.

14:06.711 --> 14:07.692
At home with the books.

14:07.812 --> 14:08.634
I've heard of this book.

14:08.654 --> 14:11.398
Florian Shasky showed me this book out in California.

14:11.438 --> 14:12.560
Carol Southern Books.

14:13.361 --> 14:14.363
I don't even know that.

14:14.383 --> 14:16.185
And look, this is inscribed to you, too.

14:16.286 --> 14:17.207
How do you like that?

14:17.327 --> 14:20.392
She wanted me to get in there.

14:20.412 --> 14:22.395
Yeah, it's Carol Southern Books.

14:22.936 --> 14:24.979
It's in the last year, 1995.

14:25.567 --> 14:31.374
And I did see a division of Clapson and Carter, which is a division of Croft, which is by the Croft, so I was right.

14:31.815 --> 14:33.857
Definitely Mr. Benjamin.

14:33.877 --> 14:34.017
Yeah.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.799
This is a famous picture here.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.682
He has that one in his book.

14:40.585 --> 14:41.066
Look at this.

14:41.106 --> 14:43.329
A celebration of reading readers.

14:43.369 --> 14:44.150
Isn't that wonderful?

14:44.650 --> 14:46.072
Do you know this woman, Estelle?

14:46.372 --> 14:51.378
Yeah, she came here and was all handsome.

14:52.079 --> 14:52.660
Beautiful.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.481
She was something with...

14:54.052 --> 14:56.015
That's quite nice.

14:56.035 --> 14:56.315
That's lovely.

14:56.335 --> 14:59.119
And this is just published, so I can get this very easily.

14:59.900 --> 15:05.187
Just let me get to see how book lovers live with and care for their lives.

15:05.207 --> 15:05.447
Good.

15:08.351 --> 15:10.233
Wouldn't you love that paper?

15:10.253 --> 15:10.494
Yeah.

15:11.435 --> 15:14.459
There are some other ideas.

15:14.479 --> 15:14.799
Okay.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.504
I just want to get the movie off.

15:18.965 --> 15:21.328
Julian, Florian had this at his house.

15:22.229 --> 15:23.130
It's still Ellis.

15:27.751 --> 15:28.492
at all.

15:29.613 --> 15:33.396
Those Carol Southern books.

15:33.416 --> 15:41.804
You know, all my life I have been a very avid collector of the quotes.

15:42.384 --> 15:43.005
Quotations.

15:43.425 --> 15:43.525
Yeah.

15:43.806 --> 15:45.067
I can see that in your book.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.389
Yeah.

15:47.409 --> 15:54.535
And here is my life's collection of all these things.

15:54.936 --> 15:56.357
And I

15:57.248 --> 16:16.287
They are rather not the usual, oh please be seated if something, they are not, you know, this usual collection of quotes, I find them very blah blah.

16:16.968 --> 16:26.057
These things have all, I think, a more thing to it.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.892
I'm curious about this quote that you have here.

16:29.193 --> 16:31.355
Why did you put that particular quote there?

16:31.375 --> 16:31.876
Which one?

16:32.076 --> 16:42.989
It said, this material, created by the world's great minds, should be put on computer disk and sold as a quotation bank to a software manufacturer.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.852
Consolidate with my notebooks.

16:45.252 --> 16:46.093
Very interesting.

16:46.293 --> 16:46.914
Yeah.

16:46.934 --> 16:53.462
So I wonder whether in any way I could interest you in a project of this book.

16:53.729 --> 17:05.187
We'll begin to try to give you all of the raw material that, you know, they only have a little more sip to it.

17:07.630 --> 17:07.730
Yeah.

17:07.751 --> 17:16.444
I mean, things like this or give your soul.

17:16.464 --> 17:16.564
Yeah.

17:17.152 --> 17:20.717
Now, these are quotations that you found in books, right?

17:21.157 --> 17:24.222
You call this your word bank, a quotation bank.

17:25.463 --> 17:32.473
And I think that, of course, is something that reaches into the New Age.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.258
To publish it would be overwhelming.

17:38.140 --> 17:43.408
You have to put this on a CD.

17:43.748 --> 17:44.509
I think so.

17:48.691 --> 17:50.353
I mean, it's Barclay.

17:50.373 --> 17:54.457
Do you know if Mr... Let me pick that up for you.

17:54.477 --> 17:55.619
Mr. Kaplan Knudish.

17:55.679 --> 17:57.000
Yes, I know Justin Kaplan.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.302
Let me pick that up for you.

17:58.322 --> 17:58.882
Okay, I'll get that.

17:58.902 --> 18:01.605
Do you know these are... No, no, no, no, doctor.

18:01.625 --> 18:02.146
Let me get it.

18:03.708 --> 18:10.976
They're great writers, but they're often quite lame.

18:10.996 --> 18:15.981
And these quotes that I have collected are really...

18:16.400 --> 18:18.242
You have a little more thing to it.

18:18.322 --> 18:19.623
Yeah, a little bite, I think.

18:19.744 --> 18:20.344
Yeah.

18:20.364 --> 18:35.701
And I wanted to ask you whether you would be interested in... Of course, it's not creative enough for you, and I would have to do a lot of work.

18:36.421 --> 18:44.550
Could you dictate the quotes that I find pertinent to...

18:45.037 --> 19:14.217
into a computer setup and then I don't know things such as there are certainly quote books on computers but that's not a bad idea a quote book on computers is not a bad idea I am sure that the Tutman book is on a computer you know all my life I have collected what I call it not bad

19:14.585 --> 19:18.449
English was my mother tongue.

19:18.649 --> 19:20.391
Every possible word.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.957
So you see something that you like and you write it down.

19:25.977 --> 19:26.317
Yeah.

19:27.298 --> 19:28.380
In a category.

19:30.822 --> 19:34.826
That looks like a pretty good book, doesn't it?

19:35.988 --> 19:36.188
Yeah.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.612
Beautiful.

19:39.972 --> 19:40.052
Wow.

19:48.014 --> 19:58.676
Well, he gets so possessed by his vital material that he loses his mastery of it.

19:59.036 --> 20:05.770
Well, Henry James cannot surpass for his bongo, that's right.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.847
Now, over a period of how many years has it been that you've been gathering?

20:12.867 --> 20:13.388
Oh, there you go.

20:13.408 --> 20:17.073
So that goes to be big.

20:17.093 --> 20:29.049
Maybe 20 years.

20:29.069 --> 20:29.469
Oh, there you go.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.273
It's all well organized here.

20:32.293 --> 20:34.616
Everything is fine.

20:34.636 --> 20:35.417
I love it.

20:35.437 --> 20:35.858
Yeah, it's amazing.

20:41.407 --> 20:47.854
You know, I don't want to say anything and then not be able to—I'd like to—let me think about it, Doctor, okay?

20:49.055 --> 20:53.540
And what I would want to do is talk to my editor and see if it's something that he'd be interested in.

20:53.800 --> 21:02.049
Do you want me to take this piece of paper off the painting before the tape gets to—I don't need to do this without doing that.

21:06.013 --> 21:09.777
You say you're not in the computer age, but—

21:10.077 --> 21:27.218
I have the basic of it, and I know the principle of it, but the step into electronics, and I'm still an old-fashioned monk who writes, and time has overtaken me.

21:27.398 --> 21:28.900
An old-fashioned monk, huh?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.622
I'm going to write that down.

21:35.228 --> 21:37.130
Such things have been done.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.713
I'm not the first one.

21:40.553 --> 21:43.498
I'm sorry that you picked your frame.

21:43.959 --> 21:46.404
No, this is wonderful.

21:49.149 --> 21:51.974
Do you read, did I ask you whether or not you read new books?

21:53.497 --> 21:56.863
Or do you more or less go over books that you've enjoyed over the years?

21:57.885 --> 22:03.135
No, it's more the old-fashioned, the classics.

22:04.010 --> 22:05.712
I'm not the first one.

22:05.932 --> 22:07.915
You quote Britton in your book.

22:08.215 --> 22:11.540
You quote Robert Britton, The Anatomy of Melancholy.

22:11.920 --> 22:16.286
Yeah, I must show you that this is really quite amazing.

22:17.968 --> 22:32.667
You know him, of course, but there is such wisdom in this thing that I thought one should really make a book out of it.

22:32.933 --> 22:38.243
I sent it to my friend Bob Blumis to the condom house.

22:38.323 --> 22:39.746
He couldn't quite see it.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.932
But it is this... Can I read this?

22:42.952 --> 22:43.193
Hmm?

22:43.213 --> 22:43.894
Can I read this?

22:44.315 --> 22:45.397
Yeah, by all means.

22:47.421 --> 22:50.487
He has done very little about it, selling it.

23:09.063 --> 23:20.482
This is very sexy, but if you are older, you'll have to make it.

23:22.506 --> 23:28.616
So you wanted to do, you asked Loomis to do a new edition of this, I guess, right?

23:28.636 --> 23:30.960
Not a new edition.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.723
A rearranged edition, I guess.

23:32.823 --> 23:34.946
A modern edition of it.

23:34.966 --> 23:35.307
I love it.

23:35.641 --> 23:39.966
It's simply picking out the pearls.

23:40.207 --> 23:41.929
Oh, I see what you said.

23:41.949 --> 23:42.149
Okay.

23:42.229 --> 23:43.331
Picking out the pearls.

23:50.359 --> 23:51.761
So you did this yourself here?

23:52.282 --> 23:58.229
Yeah, but I didn't find any takeaways for it.

23:58.410 --> 24:01.193
The burden is too good a ride off the road.

24:02.067 --> 24:05.191
Now, was this there with a color copying machine?

24:05.291 --> 24:11.359
Yeah, these are not quite the right pictures, but this, I think, is quite wonderful.

24:11.379 --> 24:11.919
See what he's doing?

24:11.939 --> 24:14.603
He's trying to juxtapose the art and classic.

24:15.284 --> 24:23.895
What you're trying to do is take classic works and juxtapose the art with the pearls that you're pulling out of the book, I guess.

24:23.915 --> 24:24.155
Yeah, right.

24:26.978 --> 24:28.260
This is Bach, of course.

24:31.295 --> 24:45.351
Of course, it's not easy to read, but there's a wonderfully profound and verbally ingenious... These are famous.

24:45.831 --> 24:53.140
See, this book here, The Anatomy of Bibliomania, he patterned after this.

24:53.180 --> 25:00.508
Jackson tried to do in a bibliomaniaical way what he did with the...

25:01.838 --> 25:06.503
Drs.

25:06.663 --> 25:10.628
Priss, milkers, and piss-profits, hope, anger to the floating.

25:10.648 --> 25:15.153
It's a little too medieval, maybe, for modern taste, you see?

25:15.173 --> 25:18.957
I admire that you put this together like that.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.340
Yeah, well, I had to do a book.

25:21.360 --> 25:25.525
It's just... So you've done about a dozen books together.

25:25.545 --> 25:29.449
Yeah, and some others will simply go into the ash cap.

25:30.205 --> 25:32.749
You can mention it to Alan.

25:32.769 --> 25:38.177
I'd like to mention, how about if I mention this idea to my editor and see what he says.

25:38.518 --> 25:39.700
Yeah.

25:40.621 --> 25:42.384
And just, you know.

25:42.865 --> 25:46.791
But they are not in the computer business.

25:48.333 --> 25:48.754
They are.

25:49.996 --> 25:50.076
Hmm?

25:50.196 --> 25:52.480
These pearls of wisdom add up to a word.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.204
But why would, I understand, what do you mean the computer business?

25:55.224 --> 25:57.788
I mean, putting all of this onto disk is what you're suggesting.

25:57.928 --> 25:58.609
Yeah, right.

25:58.943 --> 26:01.386
And so there's a quotation made to stop with.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.989
This would not be sold to the general public.

26:04.009 --> 26:07.293
It would be sold to businesses.

26:07.313 --> 26:07.373
Oh!

26:07.393 --> 26:11.458
It's kind of like a... It's another... It's like a Bettman archive.

26:11.498 --> 26:16.144
This is another idea of the expression of the Bettman philosophy.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.846
Yeah, absolutely.

26:17.866 --> 26:21.070
All these things that they've known about...

26:21.370 --> 26:26.135
To alphabetize them and make them ready for use.

26:26.155 --> 26:27.716
I see what you're saying.

26:27.737 --> 26:32.141
But I really am not... Let me just read here.

26:32.241 --> 26:39.989
These pearls of wisdom add up to a word bank useful to any writer, whether engaged in commercial, scientific, or literary pursuits.

26:40.029 --> 26:44.814
They are livelier than those found or rather than old classical quotation books like Bartlett.

26:45.234 --> 26:48.778
These quotes were garnered during a lifetime of reading by one who hoped

26:49.079 --> 26:54.706
to burnish his writing by helping himself to some brilliant formulations of the literary greats.

26:54.726 --> 26:57.329
And this is what you have written and put on it here.

26:57.830 --> 27:04.598
It's what I would burnish your... Wouldn't you write down a copy of those by your desk if it was feelable?

27:04.618 --> 27:07.622
This is not something to have the creatist.

27:07.642 --> 27:10.125
I think you ought to... Well, it's what you're saying.

27:10.145 --> 27:13.629
It would have certainly a functional purpose, wouldn't it?

27:14.430 --> 27:14.691
Yeah.

27:15.431 --> 27:16.673
Barb, how many...

27:18.762 --> 27:25.348
I see the sense of what you're doing, though.

27:25.368 --> 27:33.476
What you're suggesting is something that would serve a purpose not unlike your archive of illustrations.

27:33.496 --> 27:34.637
Right.

27:34.657 --> 27:36.499
Is that what you're saying, I think?

27:38.001 --> 27:38.441
Yes.

27:38.581 --> 27:45.748
You have to create, like I arranged the great works of art and

27:46.285 --> 27:54.455
Not too great works of art in topical form to be accessible and to be useful.

27:54.615 --> 27:55.937
Oh, I thank you very much.

27:58.159 --> 28:06.089
I have taken ideas to be pleased up by the wonderful gifts of ancient writers.

28:08.832 --> 28:13.558
But I am much too old to tackle this now, but

28:13.724 --> 28:16.647
I'd just mention it to you.

28:16.667 --> 28:24.175
I'd like to think about it and talk it over with my editor and see if it's something he'd be interested in pursuing.

28:24.496 --> 28:25.757
Yeah.

28:26.318 --> 28:29.101
Are they very computer-minded, are they?

28:29.521 --> 28:30.082
Not really.

28:31.403 --> 28:41.014
Thankfully, from my standpoint, I'm very happy that they're still interested in books as printed objects as opposed to, you know.

28:41.450 --> 28:47.258
material encoded and digitized and put onto computer disks.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.441
But we'll see.

28:49.842 --> 28:54.508
It is a good program for people looking for a program.

28:54.528 --> 28:55.249
A quotation?

28:55.349 --> 28:56.251
I'm not so sure.

28:56.291 --> 28:58.914
You see, there are softwares that have pictures.

28:58.935 --> 29:00.537
You quote very little.

29:00.657 --> 29:03.821
You do it all on your own.

29:04.122 --> 29:05.964
I do it all on my own.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.588
My wife helps me, but I

29:08.956 --> 29:15.202
The bibliography in that book I basically read, and I have all those books.

29:15.483 --> 29:21.649
And when I see things like you, I write them down, or I put bookmarks in them.

29:21.669 --> 29:23.952
All my books at home have bookmarks.

29:25.133 --> 29:28.236
And for the next book I'm going to try and do it a lot easier.

29:28.416 --> 29:34.002
I try to remember where they are and go back to get them when I'm writing them, and that doesn't seem to be very successful.

29:34.488 --> 29:35.229
way of doing it.

29:35.249 --> 29:39.373
I think your procedure was better to write them down as you get them.

29:39.393 --> 29:39.613
Absolutely.

29:39.633 --> 29:40.754
But who had that difficulty?

29:40.774 --> 29:51.364
You will never have the time to read, cast, and catch these pearls of wisdom.

29:51.384 --> 29:53.066
And you don't need it.

29:53.086 --> 29:57.410
I mean, you have your own quite delightful, easy style.

29:57.870 --> 30:02.014
For me, it was simply, I think one has to

30:02.450 --> 30:09.238
Get yourself a big barrel.

30:09.558 --> 30:18.068
It's wonderful material, it really is.

30:18.489 --> 30:20.451
Did Krauss send that book to you?

30:21.372 --> 30:25.437
No, I think it was even before I knew him.

30:25.771 --> 30:27.233
And I had no idea.

30:27.253 --> 30:29.997
No, that book was published about 79, I think, 1979.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.020
It's a new thing.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.842
It did not do well.

30:33.862 --> 30:35.845
In fact, he died shortly after that was published.

30:36.326 --> 30:36.646
Yeah.

30:37.928 --> 30:43.256
I know a lot of Marianne Krause, who runs the business with her mother, Honey.

30:43.276 --> 30:46.460
Yeah, she runs the place now, doesn't she?

30:47.161 --> 30:49.264
Mrs. Krause has nothing to...

30:49.784 --> 30:50.986
You know her either.

30:51.026 --> 30:53.830
She's very, very energetic.

30:54.490 --> 31:01.881
But, I mean, these two girls certainly don't have the know-how of Papa.

31:02.461 --> 31:02.942
I don't know.

31:02.962 --> 31:07.648
He was not very aesthetically inclined.

31:08.389 --> 31:10.813
I think it just was a very good merchant.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.615
A lot of people didn't like him.

31:13.456 --> 31:14.918
He had a lot of enemies.

31:15.980 --> 31:16.821
I guess he

31:17.273 --> 31:19.296
He got a very gruff manner to him.

31:19.316 --> 31:19.676
I don't know.

31:19.717 --> 31:20.958
I never knew him quite so.

31:20.978 --> 31:22.541
He was quite a businessman.

31:22.821 --> 31:29.370
You know how he made this million in this Krauss reprint company.

31:29.831 --> 31:46.335
After the war, so many big libraries in Yugoslavia or in other countries were destroyed with all the big annals of organic chemistry or something like that.

31:46.619 --> 31:54.291
And that he reprinted all these basic... Is this Hans Krauss who did this?

31:54.411 --> 32:09.114
Krauss Reprint Company and sold it to all these libraries in all countries where the war had simply devastated all the basic research material.

32:09.935 --> 32:12.559
And he became a micro-American there.

32:12.792 --> 32:16.399
Is this the same Krauss who bought your archives?

32:16.519 --> 32:17.561
Yeah, it's the same.

32:17.741 --> 32:19.404
Hans Krauss?

32:20.987 --> 32:21.408
Really?

32:21.668 --> 32:23.472
I didn't know it was the same.

32:23.632 --> 32:24.534
No, of course.

32:24.554 --> 32:25.656
It was owned by him.

32:25.676 --> 32:27.499
I think they recently sold it.

32:28.040 --> 32:35.053
And then to make it even easier for him, he located it in Liechtenstein.

32:35.540 --> 32:39.247
So he didn't have to pay tax or anything.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.470
This was the same cross.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.374
The same cross, yeah.

32:43.434 --> 32:50.967
He was not a man of great personal charm or great imagination.

32:50.987 --> 32:54.033
He was simply a very smart Jew.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.058
Very astute, wasn't he?

32:57.539 --> 32:57.619
Hmm?

32:57.639 --> 32:58.881
He was very astute.

32:58.962 --> 32:59.523
Yeah.

33:00.764 --> 33:02.386
So that's how he made his millions?

33:02.526 --> 33:05.829
Yeah, that's how he made his book business.

33:06.270 --> 33:08.953
I didn't know this.

33:08.973 --> 33:12.396
And it's present in the book.

33:15.600 --> 33:21.106
That really was the basic of his wealth.

33:21.486 --> 33:24.009
Well, that's very interesting.

33:24.029 --> 33:24.970
It's fascinating.

33:25.372 --> 33:27.738
Let me, I'll get back to you on this, okay?

33:27.758 --> 33:32.069
Yeah, but don't pursue it too vigorously.

33:32.630 --> 33:42.756
I myself could certainly select or talk it into a machine, but I needed, I would need...

33:43.192 --> 33:47.538
critical voice to tell me, yes, this is good.

33:47.738 --> 33:52.164
But I can tell you what sounds very attractive to me is the opportunity to work if you want something.

33:52.825 --> 34:00.595
Why should you do that when you have something really creative that you can create yourself?

34:02.998 --> 34:08.305
You know, my only concern is that I am just now starting on a new book of my own.

34:08.757 --> 34:11.681
How do you fit in?

34:13.062 --> 34:23.955
You fit in in many ways, and at least three different—we were talking about this after we left here the other night.

34:26.178 --> 34:36.250
You fit—you certainly represent—you were the first to recognize in the twentieth century the importance of art and illustration.

34:36.449 --> 34:41.595
And now this material is going to be digitized for the 21st century.

34:42.016 --> 34:57.074
And also you fit in, I'm going to have a chapter on the people such as yourself, who thankfully managed to escape Germany and came here, and that exiled in paradise type of mold.

34:57.375 --> 35:04.363
But the booksellers have it, not just the booksellers, but the people who influence the transmission of letters and stuff.

35:04.580 --> 35:08.867
and ideas and information like yourself, they haven't really been written about in the book.

35:09.528 --> 35:17.101
I'm going to concentrate on that, just so you fit in there, you fit into the future, you fit into the concept of the 20th century.

35:17.662 --> 35:21.228
I mean, I could see you going into at least three different chapters right now.

35:21.528 --> 35:21.949
Easily.

35:22.189 --> 35:23.331
Is that your thing so far?

35:24.425 --> 35:28.370
I have a concept of it.

35:28.390 --> 35:29.451
I can't say it.

35:29.472 --> 35:30.132
I have to write it.

35:30.152 --> 35:31.574
It's hard for me to articulate it.

35:31.614 --> 35:32.776
I have to write it out.

35:32.836 --> 35:35.659
But I left here very excited the other day.

35:35.700 --> 35:41.587
So much more than I ever expected.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.388
It was a joy.

35:43.049 --> 35:47.715
I knew coming here I was going to get a lot, but I left

35:49.062 --> 36:01.814
Well, you see what I love also is your dedication remains to the written word, to the text.

36:02.435 --> 36:15.728
For all of your lifetime spent as a graphic historian, as this compiler of this extraordinary archive, you still remain committed to the text, to the word man.

36:16.028 --> 36:18.090
That's a wonderful paradox.

36:18.408 --> 36:21.691
It's a wonderful book.

36:24.334 --> 36:25.775
Yes, it is.

36:26.556 --> 36:30.260
All I can have to say is, you're just going to have to wait a little while.

36:30.320 --> 36:35.825
We'll have a book to you in about two years, and you'll see.

36:35.945 --> 36:40.170
And I will go over a lot of this stuff with you, you know.

36:40.870 --> 36:43.333
How did you send us to Holt?

36:43.453 --> 36:45.715
I wrote a proposal.

36:46.690 --> 36:50.536
Well, it's really, I cannot say that this is the age of the book.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.800
The book is on the defensive these days.

36:53.821 --> 36:58.087
The thing is, they bought this book, and they did very well with it.

36:58.788 --> 37:07.461
I wondered, you know, I showed you that I wanted to show it to the Levenger, having a party in XT.

37:08.442 --> 37:11.787
And I looked through their catalog, and I wondered about

37:12.222 --> 37:22.472
Well, it sure does look like it does.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.655
It's not, but it's close.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.157
It looks like it, but it's close.

37:27.177 --> 37:34.765
I'd love to have my book offered by the catalog.

37:34.785 --> 37:35.426
I really would.

37:35.686 --> 37:39.630
Yeah, they have some sort of a party in me.

37:40.319 --> 37:42.542
I've seen him quite often there.

37:43.263 --> 37:50.513
The lights would be, but if you had been here in two weeks, I would be proud to take you along.

37:50.574 --> 37:54.679
And I certainly will show him the book next time I see him.

37:54.699 --> 37:58.144
He's a very literal, you know, my fellow.

37:58.164 --> 38:00.327
Maybe I'll give him a call or write him a letter.

38:00.428 --> 38:02.170
Maybe I should write him a letter, do you think?

38:02.511 --> 38:08.880
I will talk to him, and he will write to you, I'm sure.

38:08.900 --> 38:09.921
I...

38:10.947 --> 38:32.736
of course his stuff is all really for people that as a ruler I'm not a literary I mean simply he wants to buy literature one of my first client was a man who

38:33.104 --> 38:36.828
So it culture by the inch.

38:37.629 --> 38:45.398
He reprinted books with beautiful bindings.

38:45.799 --> 38:49.443
I think the folio society does that.

38:50.024 --> 38:54.589
In these books you never in your whole life will read, but you can

38:54.940 --> 38:59.085
simply buy this A or whatever, all of these books.

38:59.225 --> 39:01.688
And they're expensive.

39:01.928 --> 39:03.190
They're expensive books.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.232
They are very expensive.

39:05.533 --> 39:10.218
My wife and I went to an auction once in Cape Cod, and there were some books I was interested in.

39:10.258 --> 39:15.184
And this woman was paying terrific prices for them.

39:15.224 --> 39:16.385
And I went after her afterwards.

39:16.405 --> 39:19.249
I said, why are you paying all this money for these books?

39:19.329 --> 39:21.071
They're broken up sets.

39:21.512 --> 39:22.873
They're not that important.

39:23.454 --> 39:24.475
And she says, oh, the bindings.

39:24.742 --> 39:26.283
She was buying them for the bindings.

39:26.303 --> 39:29.866
She was going to sell them to people who own apartments in New York City.

39:29.887 --> 39:31.928
There was an acceptable need for that.

39:33.249 --> 39:34.110
But for binding.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.292
That's why she was binding.

39:36.312 --> 39:38.694
It's simply the visual impression.

39:38.714 --> 39:40.376
They don't want the books.

39:40.496 --> 39:44.119
They want to have the reputation of being literary.

39:45.380 --> 39:50.284
And that is a vast crowd.

39:50.304 --> 39:54.428
And here, all things that he has are

39:54.880 --> 39:57.003
terribly overpriced.

39:57.644 --> 39:59.526
I like to listen to the camera.

39:59.586 --> 40:01.489
Your book is a very nice offering there.

40:02.270 --> 40:04.112
I think you said they'll pick that up.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.534
Yeah, it's very nice.

40:06.355 --> 40:11.282
I would like to give you one of these enlarging glasses.

40:11.362 --> 40:15.628
Here, there's a little memorandum.

40:15.768 --> 40:17.290
I've been here.

40:18.592 --> 40:19.233
You're so nice.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.955
You're so fat.

40:21.273 --> 40:30.785
Oh, there was a wonderful article about you yesterday in the Fort Lauderdale paper, which I clipped.

40:30.965 --> 40:34.630
My father called me and said, you know the gentleman he went to see?

40:34.650 --> 40:35.811
I think he's in the newspaper.

40:37.093 --> 40:39.836
Yeah, it was a pretty good story, actually.

40:39.956 --> 40:44.322
It was good, plenty of mistakes in it.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.323
Well, what were the mistakes?

40:45.607 --> 40:49.691
Well, I mean, you see, minor mistakes.

40:49.951 --> 40:51.092
Yeah, but I hate mistakes.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.475
I hate to make them.

40:53.495 --> 40:53.995
I'm curious.

40:54.876 --> 40:57.319
Don't worry about it.

40:57.539 --> 41:02.944
I don't copy stories, but I was just curious, because I thought they did a pretty decent job on it.

41:04.446 --> 41:05.407
This is interesting.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.230
You haven't lived in Deerfield Beach all these years.

41:08.270 --> 41:09.611
You were in Boca for some time.

41:09.691 --> 41:10.212
Is that right?

41:10.492 --> 41:10.972
Yeah.

41:11.253 --> 41:11.813
Yeah.

41:11.853 --> 41:13.555
Just because some of these

41:13.687 --> 41:15.649
People say you live in Boca Raton.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.331
No, that's not true.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.713
I live in Deerfield.

41:19.234 --> 41:31.428
I used to live in Boca, which is a higher notch in the social appreciation.

41:31.709 --> 41:40.960
But when my wife died, we had a wonderful beachfront department.

41:41.412 --> 41:48.020
was lovely, but rather I consigned to be here without my days.

41:48.100 --> 41:55.509
But this terrible sting to create has not quite left me.

41:55.569 --> 42:05.260
But I must really try to live a life where I don't do a book.

42:05.662 --> 42:14.834
Today there are quite a few fragments left, but such a slide I had no complaint.

42:15.955 --> 42:25.467
The book you showed us yesterday, the book about the women's, you mentioned the women's profile, going to a full portrait, and you had a mock book set up.

42:25.488 --> 42:29.693
You're compiling some information for a new book on women that you showed us.

42:29.873 --> 42:31.315
Yeah, right, it's also foolish.

42:31.868 --> 42:33.570
Why do you say that?

42:34.291 --> 42:35.452
I wish you didn't say that.

42:35.492 --> 42:36.693
You have such a vibe.

42:36.733 --> 42:37.654
Yeah, I sure did.

42:37.874 --> 42:40.277
You did, yeah, but you're working on another book.

42:40.878 --> 42:46.524
Yes, I do happen to you, but it's a lot of foolish to do that.

42:46.584 --> 42:48.606
There's projects everywhere.

42:49.387 --> 42:52.750
You have projects everywhere starting.

42:53.271 --> 42:57.015
I also see him as a voice of the 20th century, too, you know.

42:57.232 --> 43:06.848
I don't think it's important.

43:06.868 --> 43:11.756
Boccaccio, you know, all the women's stuff.

43:12.056 --> 43:14.320
This is a great project too.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.084
This is a wonderful project right there.

43:17.104 --> 43:18.747
Yeah, that is very timely.

43:19.348 --> 43:24.336
Instead of writing art history in the way of...

43:24.788 --> 43:25.769
of the artist.

43:25.789 --> 43:50.430
Botticelli is certainly very important, but it's under the social life and also under research.

43:50.530 --> 43:54.053
His interpretation of the paintings, and it's brilliant.

43:54.303 --> 43:55.525
Your interpretation.

43:56.327 --> 44:03.239
Your reading of the pictures is wonderful.

44:03.419 --> 44:10.352
You need 10 years and $10,000.

44:11.193 --> 44:12.515
This is all the women here, right?

44:12.756 --> 44:16.783
This is the hardest part.

44:16.949 --> 44:44.391
Yeah, you know, I mean, can you think of a better picture of a woman advising her husband as some... to a woman in a... in a... in a... in a... in a cosmetic set-up in a...

44:44.540 --> 44:47.624
It's just, I've never thought of this aspect before in my life.

44:47.644 --> 44:48.786
It's so new to me.

44:48.806 --> 44:49.747
Ah, it's amazing.

44:50.228 --> 44:53.713
He's making the connections, the parallel connections.

44:53.853 --> 45:13.281
Of course, some periods are richer, and it is all stuff that simply addresses itself to a woman's life, and not so much the

45:14.088 --> 45:15.109
The artist.

45:15.250 --> 45:21.258
The artist story was always written in terms of great names.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.224
And here we take simply one subject.

45:29.971 --> 45:37.041
Yeah, the thing that women are, they were so important anyway in inspiring artists.

45:37.602 --> 45:42.289
This would be, but it takes ten years to develop it.

45:42.438 --> 46:10.757
Can I put this back in there for you, Doctor?

46:11.513 --> 46:15.600
So, I don't know what to do with this.

46:15.620 --> 46:20.848
Now, do you have somebody come in and help you with the filing, or do you do all this yourself?

46:20.868 --> 46:22.832
I do most of it myself.

46:22.872 --> 46:23.653
Look at this kind.

46:23.773 --> 46:25.396
That's beautiful.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.641
Picasso, maybe, no?

46:28.661 --> 46:37.656
It's a very, very munch, you know, or the paper, to use the paper.

46:39.053 --> 46:48.886
Yes, it would be in high school.

46:49.927 --> 46:52.291
Ten years more to do it.

46:53.172 --> 46:57.117
And it's very visual, naturally.

46:57.137 --> 46:57.818
It's a modern thing.

46:57.838 --> 47:00.542
Gertrude Stein by Caswell.

47:00.562 --> 47:00.842
Right.

47:03.100 --> 47:22.825
It's a good idea, but I need ten more years.

47:22.845 --> 47:25.388
Well, it looks to me like you've got a pretty good start on it, though.

47:25.428 --> 47:26.970
Yeah, I've got a good start.

47:32.737 --> 47:32.837
Yeah.

47:33.070 --> 47:33.731
Wonderful.

47:34.332 --> 47:41.624
Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's beautiful.

47:42.546 --> 47:48.956
It looks to me like it's working pretty, uh, you've got it pretty well organized already.

47:48.976 --> 47:51.120
Yeah, I guess it's nice.

47:51.681 --> 47:59.213
What would the title be, if you thought of it?

47:59.648 --> 48:11.644
He's already got a mock-up.

48:11.664 --> 48:12.024
.

48:12.064 --> 48:12.385
.

48:12.425 --> 48:12.825
.

48:12.845 --> 48:12.905
.

48:12.945 --> 48:13.206
.

48:13.246 --> 48:13.426
.

48:13.466 --> 48:13.686
.

48:14.187 --> 48:14.387
.

48:14.407 --> 48:14.768
.

48:14.788 --> 48:14.968
.

48:15.148 --> 48:15.409
.

48:15.769 --> 48:17.832
.

48:17.852 --> 48:18.132
.

48:18.152 --> 48:19.194
.

48:19.214 --> 48:19.574
.

48:19.834 --> 48:19.995
.

48:20.155 --> 48:20.595
.

48:20.615 --> 48:21.076
.

48:21.396 --> 48:21.497
.

48:21.537 --> 48:25.462
.

48:25.662 --> 48:26.523
.

48:26.543 --> 48:27.985
.

48:28.403 --> 48:29.584
Yeah.

48:29.604 --> 48:33.488
It really is, isn't it?

48:33.508 --> 48:34.089
That's it.

48:34.169 --> 48:35.370
And you've done the markup here?

48:35.810 --> 48:36.191
Yeah.

48:36.992 --> 48:39.654
Well, that shows the outline.

48:39.674 --> 48:41.276
Isn't this your calligraphy?

48:41.997 --> 48:44.860
No, that's come true to the east.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.002
That's true.

48:47.042 --> 48:47.662
Yeah.

48:49.184 --> 48:51.366
It's a young girl.

48:51.767 --> 48:57.212
I used to say, I wish you'd see it just be interested in it.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.044
I cannot do it all on my own.

49:00.064 --> 49:02.968
This thing should be as many years.

49:03.529 --> 49:18.090
I mean, sponsorship might be possible, but it's ideal for a big perfume concern, you know?

49:18.110 --> 49:19.752
I'm just going to write down the title.

49:19.853 --> 49:25.120
I think I have some written outline.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.322
Conceptually, yeah.

49:26.707 --> 49:39.224
I'm trying to get a handle on it.

49:39.264 --> 49:44.931
Your own project, which is much more important than you are right now.

49:47.494 --> 49:48.115
I have it.

49:48.175 --> 49:55.465
I showed you this all for thinking of, oh, that's important.

49:57.082 --> 49:59.786
But that's your word, a group book, right?

50:00.066 --> 50:00.286
Yeah.

50:01.568 --> 50:12.222
It is almost like simply set up for pictures instead of for the decimal system for a library, you know.

50:13.443 --> 50:26.380
This, of course, has to be constantly enlarged if there are apothecaries or herbs who do not have laundry, but in the chemistry.

50:26.765 --> 50:44.203
jewelry, and that enabled us to get so quickly at this, that it's always updated.

50:45.224 --> 50:47.647
So it's almost like the Dewey Decimal System.

50:47.747 --> 50:48.127
Yeah, right.

50:50.389 --> 50:51.190
But it's before you.

50:51.250 --> 50:52.992
That was important.

50:54.946 --> 50:56.969
And it is growing all the time.

50:57.070 --> 50:59.093
There's the gates there.

50:59.113 --> 51:01.417
Yeah, you saw that probably.

51:01.437 --> 51:03.020
This must be the time, yeah.

51:14.620 --> 51:20.430
This was my, uh, that was in the Washington Post when I returned to

51:21.068 --> 51:26.595
That I would like to borrow, and I'll copy it.

51:26.615 --> 51:28.838
No, no, no, you don't have to.

51:28.878 --> 51:34.746
These are all copies that I have.

51:34.766 --> 51:42.335
Yes, you may have read, you know, if these are some quite welcome.

51:42.355 --> 51:50.586
Oh, yeah, we have this book, yeah.

51:50.887 --> 51:59.578
Do you have the Wall Street Journal, I guess?

51:59.598 --> 51:59.798
No.

51:59.898 --> 52:01.620
I'll just write down that.

52:01.640 --> 52:02.922
Are these copies, Doctor?

52:02.942 --> 52:04.383
Yeah, these are copies.

52:04.403 --> 52:07.107
I'd like to take that.

52:10.871 --> 52:13.635
It's notice you can clearly have.

52:16.218 --> 52:17.299
This is wonderful.

52:19.996 --> 52:24.983
He'll be angling now for film on the Batman Archive.

52:25.985 --> 52:33.175
And I'm in touch with a young filmmaker who tries to sell it.

52:34.757 --> 52:38.362
He's not too... That was one of our mailing pieces.

52:38.382 --> 52:41.527
This must be 10, 15 years old.

52:41.887 --> 52:45.733
Do you have any other of these?

52:45.899 --> 52:49.764
New, unfortunately, the way from Lars.

52:49.785 --> 52:50.385
Okay, next case.

52:56.214 --> 52:57.736
Who devised this picture?

52:57.816 --> 53:06.308
That's you in profile with the... This was the head that I joined up with this Roscoe here through New York.

53:06.408 --> 53:07.089
Peter Metz.

53:07.109 --> 53:07.470
Yeah.

53:08.271 --> 53:15.501
And I invited all the art directors in New York to come to the Bettman Archive and

53:16.207 --> 53:23.213
helped themselves for a picture that they said they could use and transfer into something modern.

53:23.233 --> 53:30.540
And it came out as a little exhibit, the Batman Panopticon.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.002
I don't know how it is made.

53:33.122 --> 53:41.269
The close of this is a Peter.

53:41.289 --> 53:44.012
Yeah, but that is he in profile.

53:44.032 --> 53:44.172
I know.

53:44.354 --> 53:48.038
I thought it was very clever.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.379
He loved that picture there.

53:52.623 --> 53:53.264
Not only, yes.

53:53.504 --> 53:54.465
CBS was, yes.

53:55.126 --> 53:55.826
He took out a book.

53:55.846 --> 54:00.531
He had a life magazine in his book in 1938.

54:00.632 --> 54:03.875
Then it got into a... P.R.

54:03.895 --> 54:07.239
Marx, as you know, is an immense promoter.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.362
And so...

54:10.831 --> 54:13.013
It had quite a good response.

54:13.033 --> 54:17.779
It's called Betman Panopticon, P-A-N-O-P-T-I-C-O-N.

54:17.859 --> 54:19.040
Let me just write that down.

54:19.280 --> 54:25.006
Yeah.

54:25.026 --> 54:27.549
What does that word mean, participate?

54:28.030 --> 54:32.495
You see all, pan, all, optic, the visual.

54:33.195 --> 54:36.038
The sound is good.

54:38.201 --> 54:39.302
There was a

54:39.687 --> 54:42.290
Yes, it's in the dictionary.

54:42.310 --> 54:46.336
I don't know, some Englishman, I think in a prison.

54:46.416 --> 54:48.018
Oh, yeah, in a prison.

54:48.498 --> 54:49.920
He had a prison.

54:49.940 --> 54:53.164
I forgot now who it was.

54:53.224 --> 54:54.927
The leader of a prison.

54:54.947 --> 55:02.877
He wanted to survey the whole prison complex, and he devised an architectural scheme to do that.

55:03.718 --> 55:05.340
He could see everything.

55:05.877 --> 55:08.301
It sounded good.

55:09.082 --> 55:11.766
I started with all the beautiful women here.

55:11.846 --> 55:13.028
Yes.

55:13.128 --> 55:14.791
I didn't realize that it would happen.

55:14.811 --> 55:19.098
Really, the thing was this, that I had a falling out with Peter Marx.

55:19.198 --> 55:21.522
I really found it impossible.

55:21.542 --> 55:24.046
And they reconstructed a picture of me.

55:24.547 --> 55:26.630
It was really paper mache.

55:27.551 --> 55:28.994
It's very clever.

55:29.014 --> 55:33.100
I didn't realize it until I got here that I was being carried away.

55:36.151 --> 55:36.972
That's lovely.

55:37.032 --> 55:42.799
I have made peace with him at the ceremony two years ago.

55:45.642 --> 55:51.269
This Tilda Wood operator, quite, quite amazing.

55:51.289 --> 55:53.011
There were mobiles.

55:53.031 --> 56:00.941
A poison cannon.

56:01.041 --> 56:03.424
160, 136.

56:03.539 --> 56:07.786
Yeah, that was, uh, the next step from the coal cellar.

56:11.171 --> 56:11.311
Uh-huh.

56:11.331 --> 56:13.114
So you were uptown here for a while.

56:13.415 --> 56:13.715
Yeah.

56:13.735 --> 56:16.199
Did you ever know David Kirschenbaum in New York?

56:16.219 --> 56:16.880
He was a bookseller.

56:16.900 --> 56:18.122
The name sounds very familiar.

56:18.142 --> 56:21.708
Because he was up at, he had the Carnegie Bookshop, and he was up at 157.

56:21.728 --> 56:22.028
Oh, yeah.

56:22.068 --> 56:24.132
That's very famous.

56:24.152 --> 56:25.033
He's in this book.

56:25.394 --> 56:27.437
I interviewed him in this book.

56:28.244 --> 56:30.768
He's in chapter seven or eight.

56:30.788 --> 56:32.070
Yeah, I must look at it.

56:32.170 --> 56:35.115
Well, he was a great figure.

56:38.100 --> 56:38.621
Oh, he did.

56:39.242 --> 56:41.225
He got classic things.

56:41.365 --> 56:42.767
That is lovely.

56:43.368 --> 56:45.111
And this is like a tribute to you here.

56:45.371 --> 56:48.977
Well, not entirely.

56:48.997 --> 56:54.285
The artists gave it their creative touch.

56:55.287 --> 56:55.888
That's very nice.

57:05.487 --> 57:12.535
It was really a publicity gimmick.

57:13.396 --> 57:17.340
People always credited me.

57:17.580 --> 57:22.445
It's too far from my tastes and inclinations.

57:22.686 --> 57:34.178
One of the greatest compliments I always get is

57:34.495 --> 57:35.717
Batman, Batman.

57:36.979 --> 57:40.544
You can be the founder of the Batman Archive.

57:40.564 --> 57:43.308
You must have died.

57:43.408 --> 57:48.876
I thought he died at the Battle of Salamis.

57:48.916 --> 57:53.723
That's 2,500 years ago.

57:54.044 --> 57:58.611
I think I was fortunate in choosing this word archive.

57:59.131 --> 58:03.017
There's not even the word archive in the English language.

58:03.503 --> 58:05.405
It's archaise, you know.

58:05.685 --> 58:06.386
It only exists.

58:06.406 --> 58:07.908
Oh, it's alone in the floor?

58:08.208 --> 58:08.949
Is that right?

58:08.969 --> 58:10.431
Yeah, it's alone in the floor.

58:13.174 --> 58:15.156
So it was kind of an invention for you.

58:16.537 --> 58:17.138
I don't know.

58:17.238 --> 58:18.680
It's a friend of mine.

58:18.780 --> 58:32.295
The first one that you call myself, I'd heard that Beckwald means, no, in my comprehension, Beckwald means

58:32.748 --> 58:37.575
means really idiotic, isn't it?

58:38.055 --> 58:44.685
And then I told my friends I wanted to call them the backward photographer.

58:45.206 --> 59:01.168
So I thought that modern photography photographs the present, and I turned around and photographed the past, or I dug up pictures, but I couldn't go

59:01.621 --> 59:04.223
to this archive was rather fortunate.

59:04.604 --> 59:06.646
It was a huge choice.

59:07.186 --> 59:10.569
It's an excellent choice, because it also gives an impression of vastness.

59:12.411 --> 59:15.173
And when you think of an archive— Vista, vista.

59:15.333 --> 59:16.154
It's huge.

59:17.455 --> 59:27.364
And that's good for you, because you want people to think that this is not just a selection of pictures, it's a vast archive.

59:27.384 --> 59:28.565
I mean, I don't know what it is.

59:29.086 --> 59:30.447
Of course.

59:31.743 --> 59:41.791
I had simply, I don't know what gave that to me, had a very critical attitude towards pictures.

59:41.812 --> 59:58.285
In fact, a good editor sees plenty of written words, but only the top of the crop really does have any chance of having acceptance.

59:58.305 --> 01:00:01.328
So it always had a certain quality image.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.746
I don't think I deserve it totally, but one makes mistakes.

01:00:06.846 --> 01:00:12.393
But it simply was a great time saver for the editorial field.

01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:17.759
They had not to weigh through the thousands of pictures that I had.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:31.095
They found already a certain standard of self, quick reading that the reader doesn't have to home around the picture to the point.

01:00:31.565 --> 01:01:00.812
I sent you, I don't know, in this day or whether this will come out, and if you're sure of this article in the Civilization, they have a, I told you, they have a department's caption, and they want to explore the, explore the,

01:01:05.821 --> 01:01:34.090
relationship between between picture and caption

01:01:36.331 --> 01:01:37.972
Thank you.
