00:04.030 --> 00:11.679
well-known as a writer of some of our keen nonfiction, first essay, and recently a book on, of all things, libraries.

00:11.699 --> 00:22.592
Baker, a self-suppressed lover of books and of libraries, paradoxically began writing enduring enmity of many libraries when he wrote about the destruction of car catalogs in the New Yorker in 1994.

00:23.173 --> 00:32.063
His latest passion is for the preservation of original prints, particularly newspapers, a goal he has supported personally by founding the American newspaper repository.

00:32.735 --> 00:39.602
Baker's newest book, Double Full, Librarians and the Assault on Paper, was published in April.

00:39.622 --> 00:45.787
On my near right is Professor Richard Cox, who hails from the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences.

00:45.807 --> 00:53.655
Dr. Cox, a highly respected voice among archivists, has written extensively on professional issues in archives and records management.

00:53.675 --> 00:56.217
He has countered Baker's arguments vigorously.

00:56.237 --> 00:59.080
Originally in First Monday, a peer-reviewed internet journal,

00:59.414 --> 01:05.622
And most recently, in a preliminary review of Baker's books for the Society of American Archivists, entitled Don't Fold Up.

01:07.184 --> 01:13.071
Cox offers a professional archivist's perspective on the complex issues that surround the preservation of the past.

01:18.418 --> 01:22.443
Of course, an event like today could never happen without the hard work.

01:22.463 --> 01:28.290
I would like to thank my fellow Alumni Day Committee members, Linda Watkins, Susan Lieberthal,

01:28.692 --> 01:29.453
and Toby Pearl.

01:30.434 --> 01:38.044
The committee would also like to thank giftless professor Jeanette Bastion and student David Weaver, who suggested this morning the speakers.

01:38.064 --> 01:42.249
In addition, the alumni office and Dean Matarazzo's office have provided much assistance and guidance.

01:42.990 --> 01:48.176
Finally, our thanks to our two speakers, who have graciously agreed to air their disagreements in public here today.

01:49.518 --> 01:51.520
Mr. Baker will begin, followed by Dr. Cox.

01:52.041 --> 01:55.425
After their more formal remarks, the speakers will take questions from the audience.

01:56.114 --> 02:01.713
At that point, listeners in the overflow room are invited to come into this room in order to ask their questions if they'd like.

02:02.737 --> 02:06.108
Dean Matarato has graciously agreed to provide a little Q&A period.

02:07.373 --> 02:08.115
Over to you, gentlemen.

02:18.794 --> 02:19.856
Well, thank you.

02:19.936 --> 02:21.138
Good morning, everybody.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.162
I'm honored to be here at Simmons.

02:23.583 --> 02:34.423
And I'd like first to say a second thank you to David Weaver, who, as a student in Jeannette Bastion's archives class, read the New York article that I've written about the fate of old newspapers and

02:34.707 --> 02:36.769
asked me last year if I needed some help.

02:37.169 --> 02:50.462
And my wife and I had, at that time, 60 pallets of old newspapers, many more tons, mostly bound, bought directly or indirectly from the British Library after I tried, unsuccessfully, to move into the library to leave them.

02:50.482 --> 02:54.426
And we're sitting in a brick textile mill in Rollinsford, New Hampshire.

02:54.446 --> 02:56.949
Please raise your hand if you can hear me.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.192
And they've been packed by the library in more or less random order.

03:01.235 --> 03:26.128
of the titles we bought were the last remaining intact long runs in any library if we had bought them on behalf of a non-profit that i formed they would be cut up and sold piecemeal by a dealer who was in the birthday newspaper and historical headline business so yes we needed help david weaver got a simmons internship approved despite the fact that i am not a professional librarian or a professional archivist

03:26.885 --> 03:31.389
And he broke up on weekends, and he and I began unwrapping pallets and sorting through hundreds of volumes.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.251
We got two shelves up.

03:33.892 --> 03:38.957
He did some inventories, and he gave the whole enterprise a massive forward boost.

03:38.977 --> 03:53.511
Now, with the further help of a few dozen volunteers, the question is mostly sorted and can be used by appointment by people who want to see what these published urban landmarks of 50 or 100 or 120 years ago actually looked like.

03:53.531 --> 03:54.412
So thank you, David.

03:54.432 --> 03:55.153
Thank you, Simmons.

03:55.589 --> 04:01.356
And if some of you want to help out with shelving or indexing over time, we'd be very grateful.

04:02.057 --> 04:06.783
Richard Cox and I are here to talk about original formats in a virtual world.

04:07.704 --> 04:09.766
But it's framed as the great paper debate.

04:10.087 --> 04:16.935
And I feel that so as not to disappoint you all, we should both totter out wearing sumo wrestler diapers and go at it.

04:17.976 --> 04:21.681
Richard zapping me with a handheld laser scanner while I

04:22.032 --> 04:47.331
brandish a 1942 volume of the new york herald tribune there's clearly a feeling in some quarters that by criticizing in detail noble institutions such as the library of congress and famous washington library leaders such as berger clapp and patricia batten that i have wrongly demeaned the entire profession of librarianship i don't think that's true i believe on the contrary

04:47.716 --> 04:53.985
that I'm protecting the integrity of the profession of librarianship from some very powerful people who led it astray.

04:54.887 --> 05:05.482
The people I criticize were those who, in my opinion, used lots of federal money to push libraries into making terribly destructive mistakes, mistakes that we will never be able to recover from fully.

05:06.504 --> 05:16.879
We must learn more about the evolution of these mistakes and the little euphemisms such as preservation and reformatting that shielded them from view so as not to repeat them.

05:17.922 --> 05:32.181
I wrote the book not just because I'm upset by what's happened, which I certainly am, but because librarians who knew much more about the day-to-day realities of libraries than an outsider like me knows told me that they were upset about what's happened.

05:32.201 --> 05:44.638
There are librarians who feel completely powerless in their institutions, who know that what is going on is wrong, but who haven't been able to communicate that wrong to anyone who can expose it or counteract it.

05:46.053 --> 05:49.197
Just last week, I got a letter from some librarians at the Library of Congress.

05:50.218 --> 05:52.661
I'd like to read you some of it.

05:52.681 --> 06:03.093
These librarians write, some of us have had our professional careers abolished for standing up against the mass destruction of the nation's literary heritage.

06:03.634 --> 06:07.959
By writing this letter, we will again be under fire and in danger of losing our jobs.

06:08.559 --> 06:12.264
And top library managers do not tolerate dissent from the party line.

06:13.025 --> 06:15.047
We have been told that the sixth floor

06:15.635 --> 06:19.179
a nickname for library management, is upset by our contact with you.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.044
We protest this siege mentality.

06:23.064 --> 06:28.010
Writers of this letter call the Library of Congress's preservation program misguided.

06:29.412 --> 06:34.538
The problems of storing books and newspapers are resolvable, they say.

06:34.558 --> 06:38.383
The problems of politics and egos are another matter.

06:40.345 --> 06:45.051
As I'm sure all of you here know, there's nothing monolithic about what librarians think

06:45.453 --> 06:58.464
which is why I point out in the preface to my book that great libraries employ, and here I'm quoting, a great many book-respecting people who may not know of or approve of what their superiors or their forebears have done.

07:00.706 --> 07:08.333
We need a national library that's willing to commit to the ordered storage of the things that people have actually published and read.

07:08.934 --> 07:12.257
Whole cities once read the newspapers a hundred years ago.

07:12.637 --> 07:13.958
No other sources of words

07:14.258 --> 07:17.944
and imagery entered so many minds consistently every day.

07:19.005 --> 07:26.977
50 years ago, the Library of Congress had 67,000 bound volumes of late 19th and 20th century newspapers from every big city in the country.

07:26.998 --> 07:32.246
According to a man who did a collection well, these files were immaculate.

07:32.266 --> 07:35.491
They couldn't wait to get rid of them, he told me.

07:35.511 --> 07:40.578
Of this intergenerational bounty, only a few thousand volumes remained to be my profound.

07:40.598 --> 07:41.700
The rest have already gone.

07:42.457 --> 07:51.166
And much of the microfilm that replaced the original papers was bought and filed away sight unseen without even a spot check for quality.

07:51.186 --> 08:04.601
One of the tragedies of newspaper industry is that the biggest and most important papers, the New York Times, the Herald Tribune, the Chicago Tribune, were microfilmed earliest and least well because they were the ones that were likely to sell to other libraries.

08:05.282 --> 08:09.847
And then those libraries sold or dumped their originals.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.248
Why do you need to keep the originals?

08:12.578 --> 08:35.312
they're beautiful and interesting and old of course because the paper that they are made of is the very paper that went through the four and six color whole printing presses at the time and thus they are the best and thus they are best able to convey the complete testimony of the past and just as important because they serve as a source for

08:36.085 --> 08:43.933
The New York Times Company and Bell and Howell have announced that they will be selling libraries a digital facsimile of the Times going back to 1851.

08:43.993 --> 08:45.914
That's great.

08:46.835 --> 08:49.298
But where do they turn to make their digital facsimiles?

08:50.319 --> 08:52.881
The Times doesn't have a file of its own paper.

08:53.702 --> 09:00.088
And the New York Public Library's run has large gaps, including a 10-year gap from 1915 to 1925.

09:01.950 --> 09:05.333
So digitizers are turning to Bell and Howell's microfilm of the Times.

09:06.005 --> 09:16.179
The electronic version will come not from the original, but from black and white film, and much of the richness of the line art and the road reviewer photography sections will be lost.

09:16.580 --> 09:32.822
And no matter how good Bell & Howell's de-spackling software, that's what they call it, is, and no matter how high their scanning resolution is, they will once again be selling libraries, many of whom once owned the Times in the original, something that looks like mediocre microfilm.

09:33.680 --> 09:44.695
The searchable text that comes from the scanned file is going to be a mess at times because the OCR software isn't going to have enough information to chew on.

09:44.715 --> 09:52.886
My wish that libraries do a better job in keeping what people actually read and have read is independent of what may happen with electronic publishing.

09:52.906 --> 10:00.116
Maybe in two years or two months, most people will be reading the New York Times and books exclusively as phosphors on the screen.

10:00.176 --> 10:02.860
If so, keep screen images of the phosphors.

10:03.498 --> 10:09.807
At the moment, though, most people read the Times as sheets of Raleigh paper covered with pictures and advertisements.

10:09.827 --> 10:15.955
And yet no library right now is keeping the New York Times in paper, not one as far as I know.

10:15.975 --> 10:23.206
Libraries subscribe to the Times and the microfilm of the Times, and then they talk about the paper after a brief holding period.

10:23.226 --> 10:26.891
I'm not alone in being surprised and just paid attention.

10:26.911 --> 10:29.254
Most people I've talked to are.

10:29.274 --> 10:29.995
And like saying,

10:30.346 --> 10:36.316
that libraries should be saving every single copy of every edition of every single paper in the country?

10:36.797 --> 10:38.159
Of course not.

10:38.179 --> 10:46.052
I'm saying that right now we're saving no current copies, zero, and clearly we can do better than this.

10:46.072 --> 10:56.910
And I'm saying that once upon a time, libraries owned, just by happenstance, different editions of the same daily papers, because they've been sent different editions, which they found,

10:57.548 --> 11:09.305
in their wisdom, and these textual differences, these differing headlines and pictures and articles were lost when they substituted the unvarying microfilm copy for what they had.

11:09.325 --> 11:19.320
And I'm saying that the US newspaper program is still today paying libraries to film old originals and then allowing them to throw the papers out to free up space.

11:20.141 --> 11:23.546
Does that mean that I insist that libraries must save everything?

11:23.586 --> 11:26.070
At the turn of the last century,

11:26.253 --> 11:31.980
Joseph Pulitzer published half a million or a million copies of the New York world every day.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.123
Almost all of these copies are gone.

11:35.844 --> 11:39.709
They're cut up, burned, destroyed, because that's the way life is.

11:40.289 --> 11:42.612
Most of what we publish is lost.

11:43.613 --> 11:51.623
But I do believe we need to keep a few original copies of what is that draw most influential paper in our history, just a few.

11:51.643 --> 11:55.467
Not everything, but one 500,000

11:55.818 --> 11:56.539
of everything.

11:57.900 --> 12:20.425
A culture that is able to save locomotives and space capsules and wallpaper collections and gardens full of enormous rusting pieces of sculpture and the correspondence of untold numbers of minor historical figures and rare strains of disease germs can, I think, find a way to hold onto something as centrally important as this.

12:21.772 --> 12:25.957
Of course, every library and archive and historical society worries about shelf space.

12:27.259 --> 12:31.204
Librarians tussle over shelf space within their own institutions.

12:31.224 --> 12:37.412
But compared with making digital copies or microfilm copies, space is cheap.

12:37.432 --> 12:48.606
It would cost my little nonprofit tens of millions of dollars to create digital images of the millions of pages of newspapers it owns in color at a resolution that would allow researchers to read them comfortably.

12:49.278 --> 12:54.886
On the other hand, it costs us $26,000 a year to rent the space to keep them safe.

12:54.926 --> 12:59.592
As a country, we've really got to do a better job of weighing these relative costs.

13:00.674 --> 13:03.919
Drive from Boston to New York and look at the warehouses.

13:03.939 --> 13:05.661
There are hundreds of them.

13:05.681 --> 13:07.444
Some of them have 50 truck bays.

13:08.024 --> 13:08.725
What are they holding?

13:09.246 --> 13:16.777
They're holding cheese products for truck parts or Happy Meal toys, for Pentium computers that will be scrapped in five years.

13:18.279 --> 13:19.200
Some of them are police.

13:20.429 --> 13:47.888
a few big room clean warehouses withhold everything that our national library has been sent free by publishers and has rejected every year our national library says that they don't have enough space and they are unwilling to leave space even though they're willing to budget 94 million dollars for digital questions just a little more about space last month i gave a talk at the ribbon cutting ceremony at the new storage facility from duke university library

13:49.741 --> 13:57.690
It's a building like the Harvard Depository, where things are stored in random order, reached by a state-of-the-art cherry picker.

13:57.710 --> 14:03.076
The building costs $7.5 million to build, and it will hold 2.5 million books.

14:03.817 --> 14:10.464
So a brand-new, ultra-cool book building costs only $3 a book to build.

14:10.484 --> 14:13.968
A tiny number of the books that are going into that building have been digitally scanned.

14:14.148 --> 14:15.830
And here's the salient comparison.

14:15.850 --> 14:19.714
To store a 19th-century book in this warehouse, it costs $3 a book.

14:19.981 --> 14:24.688
plus an estimated 17 cents a book in maintenance and static.

14:24.708 --> 14:29.054
To scan a 19th century book, it costs at least $100 a book.

14:29.074 --> 14:32.979
If you want to scan it in color at high resolution, costs leap up from there.

14:33.880 --> 14:37.566
And the physical book doesn't need periodic refreshing on new media.

14:38.006 --> 14:39.909
It doesn't need platform migration.

14:39.949 --> 14:42.192
It doesn't even need an electrical outlet.

14:43.268 --> 14:51.097
Not that it's a bad thing to take digital pictures of books, as long as the picture taken doesn't require that the book be cut out of its binding and guillotined.

14:51.638 --> 14:55.863
The electric versions can be extraordinarily useful.

14:55.883 --> 15:04.493
I prefer that book collections were stored in traditional call number order, browsably, which costs a little more, say $10 a book.

15:04.513 --> 15:11.301
But the point is that off-site storage, even traditional call number storage, is the cheapest thing it can possibly do

15:11.534 --> 15:14.258
to maintain access to a collection.

15:14.278 --> 15:26.774
And any scanning or microfilming that big research libraries embark on in the name of remote access should be, from now on, be done with the expectation that the original book go back on the shelf when the copying is done.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.839
There's a lot of money for digitization right now.

15:30.859 --> 15:40.191
If we set things up so that we tied 10% into a paper conservancy fund as we digitized to provide the safekeeping of the original afterward, we'd be just fine.

15:40.897 --> 15:48.790
In fact, at the beginning of a scanned or OCR or microfilms document, it might be nice to read, no originals were harmed.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.361
Research library collections grow.

15:56.463 --> 15:58.846
Your children's feet grow, and you buy them new shoes.

15:59.508 --> 16:07.140
The bigger feet do not represent a growth problem, but a developmental fact, something to be proud of.

16:08.369 --> 16:13.356
For the past half century or more, though, growth has been an embarrassment to some Washington visionaries.

16:13.416 --> 16:20.246
They were swept by a kind of Cold War fervor of informational reform, and they wanted all growth to stop.

16:20.927 --> 16:26.715
Libraries would reach a certain fixed size, a few million volumes, and then the weeding parties would gather.

16:27.083 --> 16:42.119
and the microcopying would crunch down the excess, and when the microfilm schools themselves took up too much room, and they could microcopy the microcopies at ultra-high resolution, and crunch things down more, and the stacks would function like a vast trash compactor, squeezing the words.

16:43.060 --> 16:45.282
Because words were squeezable, weren't they?

16:45.302 --> 16:54.171
They were disembodied astral presences that had nothing to do with the ink that formed them, or the paper that they were printed on, or the findings that held paper together.

16:54.522 --> 16:59.229
They could be reformatted, preserved by being destroyed, because they were immaterial.

16:59.249 --> 17:01.392
The books would still exist.

17:01.412 --> 17:03.315
They would just not exist.

17:03.335 --> 17:05.017
They would be there, but they wouldn't be there.

17:05.518 --> 17:15.613
You could hold your head high and say you had the finest US newspaper collection in the world, but in fact, you got rid of 90% of it and replaced it with microphones.

17:15.633 --> 17:18.076
What was the source of this thinking?

17:18.096 --> 17:22.803
There was one especially influential person, some of you may have heard about, most of you may have heard about.

17:22.823 --> 17:24.225
His name was Fremont Ryder.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.967
head librarian at Weston.

17:26.987 --> 17:33.797
Ryder's first book published in 1909 was about the amazing discoveries of spirit wrappings and table turnings and levitation.

17:33.817 --> 17:37.803
He felt these things deserve serious study, and that the tables did, in fact, turn.

17:38.804 --> 17:39.866
He wrote Pulp Fiction.

17:40.507 --> 17:42.309
He was the managing editor of the Library Journal.

17:42.890 --> 17:49.960
And when he went bankrupt in 1929, after a manic episode in which he spent a small fortune founding a supper club on Long Island,

17:51.273 --> 17:58.703
He wrote an indignant pamphlet in which he said that people were fed up with being indebted to banks, and they wanted a new deal.

17:59.584 --> 18:06.634
He sent the pamphlet to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Roosevelt shot him back a letter with a handwritten note saying, you're right, keep it up.

18:06.654 --> 18:12.401
And a few months later, Roosevelt, in his nomination speech, pledged himself to a new deal for the American people.

18:13.643 --> 18:18.850
So Fremont Reiter was an influential person, and his new deal for librarians was this.

18:19.657 --> 18:30.515
Make or buy micro copies of your book collection, sell off the book collection to dealers at scrap prices, and you will make, in his words, an actual cash profit on the substitution.

18:31.436 --> 18:35.222
You'll enrich your library by getting rid of its books.

18:35.242 --> 18:46.761
Lider got the Librarian of Congress, and the Deputy Librarian of Congress, and the Head Librarian at Michigan, and the Head Librarian at Harvard, and other big time leaders all over the library world to blurb his book and serve on his microcard committee.

18:47.433 --> 18:51.660
It's a mathematical fact that book collections double every 16 years, Ryder said.

18:52.482 --> 18:53.704
Turns out he was wrong about that.

18:54.305 --> 19:02.780
And if we didn't start buying Fremont Ryder's microcard reading machines and selling off the collections, the stacks were going to overrun the entire square footage of New Jersey.

19:03.922 --> 19:10.773
Building a storage warehouse was, according to Ryder, a confession of past failure.

19:10.793 --> 19:12.276
It was unmanly.

19:13.960 --> 19:27.859
This way of thinking continues in some libraries, and it was very powerful in the 1980s, when the Library of Congress had high votes for its optical disk pilot project, which could, according to the deputy librarian, squeeze down the library's three buildings to one.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.444
But the optical disk pilot program didn't work out.

19:31.464 --> 19:34.528
Nobody uses both big platters anymore.

19:34.548 --> 19:43.140
And over the past decade or so, some enlightened library administrators have begun to accept the fact that the easiest way to keep a research collection

19:43.880 --> 20:07.660
is to keep the research collection there's no shame in growth it's not a confession of failure putting up shelves sufficient to hold what's there is the crucially important primary task that research fibers must fulfill they must do this because no other institutions public or private can be dependent on to keep these things the obscure things the cumbersome things but even though they're used only once in 10 years

20:08.602 --> 20:14.611
or 30 years, or 50 years, are valuable because they are what people published and said.

20:15.672 --> 20:21.120
To a literature, the fact that something is little used is a positive attribute.

20:21.141 --> 20:37.765
If a photo editor for a documentary on, say, Ellis Island pages through the Road of Revere section of a newspaper or a forgotten autobiography and finds a picture that has never been reproduced before, she is overjoyed because the picture is interesting and because it's unused.

20:38.791 --> 20:42.976
We till around in great collections looking for things that have lain unnoticed.

20:42.996 --> 20:47.320
The urge to search through obscurity is basic scholarship.

20:47.340 --> 20:54.508
If the research libraries don't keep it, don't keep copies of the stuff that we as a culture publish, nobody else is going to do it.

20:54.528 --> 20:56.170
It just won't happen.

20:56.190 --> 20:59.374
We can't depend on businesses to save our past.

20:59.474 --> 21:02.217
We just care about the present and they go out of business.

21:03.901 --> 21:08.929
We understand why fragile old flags and old presidential letters are valuable as things.

21:08.949 --> 21:15.239
We don't believe that taking a snapshot of Plymouth Rock amounts to a reformatting of Plymouth Rock.

21:16.101 --> 21:22.892
And after some long and painful decades of urban renewal, we're doing better with old mills and train stations.

21:22.912 --> 21:29.723
There are very nice postcards of Whistler's Woman in White in museum gift shops, but Whistler's Woman in White is still on the wall.

21:30.749 --> 21:37.178
If libraries ask for storage money with the same intensity, they ask for digitizing or microfilming money.

21:37.438 --> 21:44.368
If they budget it right into the grant proposals for digitization, the public will understand and oblige.

21:44.388 --> 21:48.013
We really want you to keep this stuff.

21:48.033 --> 21:54.201
Now, I want to talk for a last moment about conspiracies and personal negative.

21:57.205 --> 21:58.427
In a well-written place,

21:59.285 --> 22:02.068
previously mentioned, called Don't Fold Up.

22:02.088 --> 22:07.514
Responding to Nicholson Baker's double fold, Richard Cox says several times that I present conspiracy theories in my book.

22:08.896 --> 22:09.456
I just don't.

22:10.718 --> 22:19.447
I do point out in the book that some of the great library leaders and theorists of the 50s and 60s worked for the CIA in the department of defense.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.850
I never use the word conspiracy.

22:22.977 --> 22:48.512
joseph becker a senior cia informationalist designed the library of the future exhibits at the seattle and the new york world fair herman fustler head of the university of chicago library had been the chief librarian of the manhattan project and he was a consultant to the economic energy commission bernard class the deputy librarian of congress and later the founder of the multi-influential library group the council on library resources

22:49.066 --> 22:58.208
was a CIA liaison and consultant for decades with top secret clearance as were several of the other board members of the council on library resources.

22:59.110 --> 23:04.122
Now when I first stumbled on this, and I was just trying to find out a little more about Werner Clappen,

23:04.591 --> 23:09.518
since he was the most influential librarian at the time, I found it all quite fascinating.

23:09.538 --> 23:22.336
And I think that there's a lot more work to be done by library historians in teasing out the way that the intelligence community has in certain areas hired librarians to help them with their enormous indexing and filing and classifying problems.

23:23.017 --> 23:31.729
Obviously, the informational needs of the CIA and the DOD, swift but eyes only movement, instant retreatability, ease of record destruction,

23:32.013 --> 23:38.982
are different from the informational needs of someone slowly accumulating research in a particular immigrant neighborhood in Boston in 1906.

23:39.283 --> 23:47.393
And for a long time, I believe, intelligence requirements had an undue influence on decision-making at some libraries.

23:48.415 --> 23:50.918
None of this amounts to a conspiracy, however.

23:50.938 --> 23:59.910
Herman Klatt and Herman Fosterowitz were sincere information scientists of a certain stripe who strongly believed that you could reform libraries

24:00.430 --> 24:26.286
and win the cold war finally about my personal conductive mostly i simply quote what people say to me or what they've written when i disagree with what they say i say so the subtitle of my book libraries and the assault on paper comes from a passage written by patricia batten in 1983 when she says that her university depended on

24:26.620 --> 24:34.370
outside funding, this is a quote, and cooperative projects for an active assault on our large collection of brittle materials.

24:35.851 --> 24:40.517
I do criticize acts, terrible acts, of needless destruction.

24:41.358 --> 24:52.712
We were told that the large-scale federal brittle books program began at the National Endowment for the Humanities in the late 1980s, supplant microfilm, three million books over 20 years, pushed by Patricia Batten and others,

24:53.063 --> 24:55.565
was a way of saving the human record.

24:55.585 --> 25:13.964
But if you read the planning document on which the Brittle Books program was built, we learned that built into the plan was the idea that if one library microfilmed a book, then five libraries could discard their copies of the book, which would amount to a space savings of hundreds of millions of dollars.

25:14.865 --> 25:22.412
The Brittle Books program was sold as a kind of emergency book rescue, but it was in fact predicated on book destruction.

25:23.472 --> 25:28.639
It's time the public and librarians knew of this inversion of impact.

25:28.679 --> 25:34.467
Libraries win or lose the public's trust based on their actions.

25:35.128 --> 25:40.915
And the only way we can evaluate the trustworthiness of their actions is if we know what the actions are.

25:41.897 --> 25:47.524
And yet it is today extremely difficult to find out what libraries like the Library of Congress choose to discard.

25:48.566 --> 25:53.192
And so to close, I'd like to recommend that all research libraries that receive public money

25:53.527 --> 25:58.153
be required to post lists of proposed discards on their websites.

25:59.615 --> 26:08.547
There's a giant hole in the 20th century as a result of the casualties of micro-filming projects, but we have a chance to do it right this time around.

26:08.567 --> 26:14.876
Offer the boom of networked pages without destroying the riches of local collections.

26:14.896 --> 26:15.096
Thank you.

26:33.571 --> 26:36.517
Does the slide show set up?

26:36.537 --> 26:37.278
The slide projector?

26:38.420 --> 26:40.143
Oh great.

26:40.163 --> 26:43.049
I don't have a thing.

26:43.069 --> 26:48.439
So when I want to switch the slide, do I just say next?

26:53.228 --> 26:57.115
I want to show you just some slides of the

26:57.837 --> 27:19.862
because um i think if i just sit here and say a note paper they're beautiful and they're precious and they shouldn't have been thrown out that's fine but if if i show you some pictures of what i'm talking about you'll be able to judge for yourself whether these things have informational value in their illustrations say that the microphone doesn't fully capture

27:31.553 --> 27:55.249
This is what the New York world looks like in the era of rag paper before Joseph Pulitzer bought it.

27:55.269 --> 27:59.055
It's only eight pages long because rag paper was extremely expensive.

27:59.075 --> 28:00.717
There were periodic rag shortages.

28:01.186 --> 28:26.400
and they had to jam everything onto these eight pages so they used a very tiny type but they didn't really have briefing on them Pulitzer and Hearst came to New York City and they transformed the way people read the news here's the same newspaper in 1898 after the installation of I think their second huge printing press

28:26.650 --> 28:30.955
The most marvelous mechanical production of the age is what they call this printing press.

28:30.975 --> 28:40.006
And they have an illustration here of the color pages going through it, being cut and folded, and then followed by eight pages of color fashion illustrations.

28:40.026 --> 28:47.155
So this was really the key to the success of these pictures, was that they were offering a readership color that they hadn't seen before.

28:47.175 --> 28:55.645
You could get a whole list in every Sunday for very, very cheap.

28:56.789 --> 29:05.340
Pulitzer and Hearst were competing, and this is an illustration that's also in the book, to show the finest battle illustrations in 1898.

29:05.580 --> 29:11.948
So here on its side, to take advantage of the full size of the page, is an illustration with a raking searchlight.

29:11.968 --> 29:24.484
And then on the right, you can see the trajectory of a shell that leaves the battleship on the left, and it rises up over a column of type in the middle, and then lands on the shore on the right-hand side.

29:25.190 --> 29:36.005
So they're really thinking about the way the paper looked as a graphic thing.

29:36.626 --> 29:41.513
This muck wrecking, there's lots of muck wrecking in these turn-of-the-century papers obviously.

29:41.533 --> 29:53.610
This is the problem sweatshops, the man sewing on the left, the sweatshop owner in the middle, selling to the rich woman on the right.

29:53.776 --> 29:54.777
She's one of the 400.

29:56.159 --> 30:02.509
And then this is the same thing on microfilm.

30:03.010 --> 30:08.337
This is the New York Public Library's film, which is what everybody's film is, made in 1951.

30:09.139 --> 30:14.066
And one of the problems is that you have to kind of reassemble it out of 8 1⁄2 by 11 printouts.

30:15.308 --> 30:18.332
And it's just not the same.

30:20.641 --> 30:22.343
Here is a cartoon from 1898.

30:22.804 --> 30:24.686
The cartoon pages are incredible.

30:24.706 --> 30:31.694
The Persecution Mania, kind of pre-Freudian thing, with the Red Devil inside them on the left.

30:31.714 --> 30:40.545
Divorced in one Dakota day, it says, and there's a man on the left, a woman on the right, and I've seen the vignettes of their divorce, their Dakota divorce going through.

30:41.126 --> 30:44.129
These newspapers, like the world, have never been indexed.

30:44.149 --> 30:47.273
One of the problems is that you can't find what's in here because

30:47.860 --> 30:49.021
There's no way to find it.

30:49.462 --> 30:56.510
So one of the things I'm hoping to do is to do a kind of modest pilot project indexing the magazine sections of some of the world.

30:58.573 --> 31:00.475
Another cartoon.

31:01.035 --> 31:08.244
This is the labor-saving dodges for the hot weather and the man up in the upper left is diving into an automatic undressing machine.

31:08.684 --> 31:11.768
This is all pre-Ruth Goldberg but very Ruth Goldbergian.

31:11.868 --> 31:13.530
On the left, lower left, is a

31:13.848 --> 31:18.433
robotic lover who takes care of that while the man kind of lounges on the settee.

31:20.575 --> 31:22.397
This is the same thing on microfilm.

31:23.378 --> 31:31.687
You still see the robotic lover, you still see this undressing machine, but it just doesn't kind of leap out at you.

31:31.747 --> 31:42.859
Microfilm is a high contrast medium, which means it wants to be either black or white, which in the case of a color illustration isn't ideal.

31:49.015 --> 31:54.400
This just shows one of the things that the British Library was most scrupulous about.

31:54.440 --> 31:59.985
They had to stamp every volume discarded by the British Library or BL canceled.

32:00.005 --> 32:12.838
First they were stamping everything in black and some of the stamping was actually obscuring the text so I asked if they could at least use a different color so they resorted to green but then they stamped in this case right in the guy's head.

32:12.958 --> 32:13.218
Boom.

32:13.798 --> 32:15.560
And then another bear.

32:16.381 --> 32:17.622
This is probably the last

32:18.428 --> 32:27.038
remaining range of this without a copy of that illustration certainly many libraries.

32:27.058 --> 32:32.965
From 1900 to 1930 there isn't any other library as far as I know but half of the New York world in the original.

32:33.026 --> 32:45.921
The American Antiquarian Society has a run of the world through 1900s so fortunately between the American newspaper repositories run and the American Antiquarian Society run there is now

32:46.340 --> 32:50.065
one complete run of Joseph Pulitzer's masterpiece.

32:50.105 --> 32:57.034
This is the magazine section, which is a huge full-size print on the regular newsprint stock.

32:59.196 --> 33:02.681
Every week there was some illustration.

33:03.121 --> 33:07.026
This is the hazards of a newly electrified New York City.

33:07.106 --> 33:10.811
All these pictures are from the first decade of the 20th century.

33:11.732 --> 33:14.676
Lots of maps of New York underground always.

33:14.926 --> 33:23.760
bridges, and they were just seizing with pride in this newly powerful city, and the newspapers stood for all that.

33:24.341 --> 33:31.111
New York churches turned into dives, a boxing match in a church on the lower half.

33:35.818 --> 33:41.507
New York's first airship station, I think probably its last.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.691
They had to have airships.

33:46.731 --> 33:49.153
There was just an obsession with airships, really.

33:49.174 --> 33:50.615
An airship every Sunday.

33:52.237 --> 33:53.158
The Gret airship.

33:56.562 --> 33:59.345
And this is how the eclipse works.

33:59.425 --> 34:02.168
Kind of a nice one from, I think, 1905 or something.

34:02.829 --> 34:06.293
And how the Chinese treatment of the eclipse on the lower right.

34:07.234 --> 34:12.920
And then the eclipse on microfilm.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.582
There is no eclipse on microfilm.

34:20.418 --> 34:23.763
There.

34:23.983 --> 34:28.029
This is a digital photograph, by the way, I can say proudly.

34:28.109 --> 34:28.910
Who gets your money?

34:29.230 --> 34:34.578
And it's John D. Rockefeller, Morgan, and Ryan all sharpening their axes as the whole guy turns the wheel.

34:34.978 --> 34:43.691
And then in the lower left corner, around the perimeter, there are all the products, like shoes and candles and railroads and everything.

34:43.711 --> 34:49.699
Then Morgan, Rockefeller, and Ryan all conjointly control a wonderful

34:50.118 --> 34:51.480
conspiracy theory there.

34:53.982 --> 34:55.925
How far can New York climb into the sky?

34:56.145 --> 35:10.120
And this is a composite illustration of New York's finest buildings, including the Pulitzer Building, which is second from the right, which was torn down in 1954, about the time that the New York Public Library was microfilming.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.023
Yes, I know.

35:12.683 --> 35:19.551
The Sunday Magazine shows the heroic rescue of our great firemen.

35:21.337 --> 35:22.718
showing off the printing press.

35:22.738 --> 35:24.981
And then there were lots of fashion pages.

35:25.001 --> 35:26.122
This is a hat.

35:26.142 --> 35:28.684
They had to have a hat in every issue as well.

35:29.385 --> 35:33.850
And then on the right, Gibson Girl inserts, which are carefully bound in by the British Library.

35:34.650 --> 35:39.735
And generally don't appear on the microfilm because they're easily stolen.

35:40.496 --> 35:42.318
There are many things that don't appear on the microfilm.

35:42.338 --> 35:43.679
Whole new sections don't.

35:45.161 --> 35:47.243
Because each microfilm

35:47.341 --> 35:49.324
set was unique in a way.

35:49.504 --> 36:00.201
They all were missing things and they all had slightly different editions and so each one of them is sort of like a magical falter or something that has the variations that are interesting.

36:07.954 --> 36:10.598
Inside these magazine sections are incredible things.

36:11.017 --> 36:13.239
The dumbbell might be in the corset on the right.

36:15.201 --> 36:24.431
During the New York world, in the first third of the 20th century, the world was really neat literary New York paper, and it published Robert Bensley and E.B.

36:24.471 --> 36:31.198
White and Dorothy Parker's poem, Men Don't Make Passes at Girls Who Wear Glass, the first published in the world.

36:31.898 --> 36:40.247
It was the New Yorker magazine before the New Yorker magazine existed, and yet there is really no run of this thing around, except this one, as far as I know.

36:40.835 --> 36:46.983
He was a nice illustration of a liar.

36:48.345 --> 36:55.454
Henry, on the lower left, was a staff writer and had a short story almost every week in the world.

36:55.494 --> 37:05.307
On the upper left is Norbert Wiener, before Norbert Wiener became a famous cyberneticist and war scientist who protected nuclear weapons.

37:10.990 --> 37:18.018
And here on the right is the adventures of a man who dressed up as an Italian tambourine girl and wrote about it.

37:19.159 --> 37:29.251
On the left is the hazards of being a diver in the docks of New York City.

37:29.271 --> 37:39.883
On the right here is a man named Leonard who was born without a nose and he wanted a nose very much and so two doctors said that they would give him a nose by sewing his finger to his face.

37:40.184 --> 37:45.552
and allowing them to have it heal there, then they would agitate the finger.

37:46.033 --> 37:57.930
Well, Mr. Leonard was okay with this for a while, and then he began to be driven crazy by this finger in his face all night and all night, and so he tore it away, and then he decided he would do it again.

37:58.190 --> 38:02.817
So they sewed it back, and then he tore it away again, and sewed it back, and finally he

38:03.185 --> 38:10.355
according to the reporter, left the hospital with the foundations of a new nose firmly attached to his face.

38:10.956 --> 38:22.432
Sometimes the things that experts think are the right thing to do are not the right thing to do.

38:22.552 --> 38:26.998
Lots of plans for the beauties of New York had to come.

38:28.767 --> 38:31.370
and of beauties of New York that exist.

38:31.390 --> 38:33.171
Of course, there are airships on top.

38:33.392 --> 38:38.377
I'm sorry, I'm slow with these.

38:39.198 --> 38:45.544
They hired German, French Italian illustrators in 1911 to come to New York and illustrate the strangeness of the city.

38:46.025 --> 38:50.669
So here's some grotesque that a German illustrator noticed on a rooftop.

38:51.250 --> 38:58.217
And here in 1927, a smaller magazine section, women raised chariots in the hippodrome, latest excavations.

38:58.602 --> 39:14.466
There were many other runs, very rare and beautiful runs of immigrant newspapers, all published in the United States, that were part of this discarding program at the British Library, which had the finest more newspaper collection anywhere.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.472
Irish World from the turn of the century.

39:24.201 --> 39:26.044
All the guts were heard.

39:27.762 --> 39:38.277
The New York Tribune also, just to show you that there are other papers in this thing, and Record Act, Microfilm of the Tribune, the Pale Blue is no longer there.

39:41.301 --> 39:48.211
And the Road of Revere sections, which are pervasive in all the great newspapers really through the 40s.

39:49.052 --> 39:53.078
I printed in much higher resolution on thicker stock.

39:53.243 --> 39:59.332
And they're one of the real losses when you go to microfilm, because they just lose.

39:59.552 --> 40:05.481
You see the sprocket markings, but you don't see the half pounds.

40:05.501 --> 40:08.084
The New York Forward is another beautiful run.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.087
Here's one from 1941.

40:10.348 --> 40:11.970
It also has wrote a review section.

40:12.991 --> 40:16.857
And it says, this is the world that the Jewish children of today have inherited.

40:16.877 --> 40:18.179
The pictures of refugees.

40:18.359 --> 40:22.525
I don't think the New York Forward itself has a run in this paper.

40:23.045 --> 40:24.967
I don't know what happened there.

40:26.590 --> 40:35.721
This is what they looked like when they unwrapped them on pallets.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.825
More beauties, I think.

40:39.526 --> 40:40.227
Greek paper.

40:48.818 --> 40:51.381
And the Chicago Tribune also is an incredible thing.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.132
The Statue of Liberty holding a fistful of dollars.

40:58.017 --> 41:01.140
And their women's sections were in blue ink sometimes.

41:03.443 --> 41:06.147
Dinosaurs, of course, gotta have those in 1933.

41:06.928 --> 41:10.051
And King Carol with his paramours, 1933.

41:10.672 --> 41:14.156
And Marilyn Monroe in 1950, an early picture of her.

41:15.458 --> 41:19.663
And then, if you flip that over, gangs launch events at the Korean War.

41:20.048 --> 41:24.554
this wonderful feeling that the newspapers offer of simultaneity.

41:25.875 --> 41:31.522
Moon launched by Red, is how the Chicago's Daily Tribune, which was very conservative, describes Sputnik.

41:33.565 --> 41:41.775
And here's how the New York World and some of the forward look now in Balmsford, New Hampshire, although they should never have left England.

41:41.795 --> 41:48.503
And here's how, with David Weaver's help, sorted some of these runs into years.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.289
Then each run is sort of like a whale.

41:51.370 --> 41:51.930
It's huge.

41:52.652 --> 42:02.066
But when you really add up the amount of space that a given run of a paper takes, it's tiny, I think.

42:02.126 --> 42:05.992
I mean, it's just not that much.

42:06.092 --> 42:07.594
I'm getting to the end now.

42:07.614 --> 42:08.596
I'm sorry it's taking so long.

42:08.616 --> 42:12.502
But here's the skyscraper is a modern tower of Babel.

42:12.582 --> 42:16.127
And each one of these little vignettes repays study, 1898.

42:21.980 --> 42:24.503
And this is from 1927 again.

42:24.563 --> 42:27.666
What will we look like 2,000 years from now?

42:27.726 --> 42:38.078
The man sits in a modern-looking place, deco, with three radio speakers.

42:42.943 --> 42:44.485
Want to do it?

42:44.505 --> 42:49.911
And looking out at these kind of minarets, Kremlin-esque minarets.

42:51.224 --> 42:52.566
We'll just go to the next slide.

42:52.586 --> 43:03.961
What will we look like 2,000 years from now?

43:05.923 --> 43:11.671
Well, this is what we're going to look like 2,000 years from now, unless we do a better job of keeping the originals.

43:11.771 --> 43:12.372
Thank you very much.

43:36.736 --> 43:39.080
It's a long way for the lights to come back.

43:39.220 --> 43:44.869
I just say I don't have any pretty pictures to show.

43:44.889 --> 44:03.739
But it does remind me of a few weeks ago I was sitting in my study at home and I was preparing a talk for another conference and I was at one point making an allusion to the Nicholson Baker book and my PowerPoint slide that I put photographs of Nicholson Baker there so I went to the website.

44:04.377 --> 44:05.841
He has a fan page.

44:06.101 --> 44:10.432
I don't have a fan page.

44:11.154 --> 44:19.635
I pulled a photograph off and I was putting it into this PowerPoint slide and my daughter comes into the room and she says, who is that?

44:20.847 --> 44:22.849
the man I'm debating up in Boston.

44:22.869 --> 44:27.194
And she says, sign me up for that.

44:27.214 --> 44:34.923
That's what I want to do, go to a debate with two middle-aged, white-heared, married men.

44:34.943 --> 44:37.566
I thought, well, that sort of set it off.

44:37.586 --> 44:39.949
I should point out that today's her 16th birthday.

44:39.969 --> 44:45.596
If you were present, she gets to come up to Boston tomorrow.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.659
She doesn't have to experience any of this.

44:48.679 --> 44:49.200
OK.

44:49.940 --> 45:00.312
At one far distant point, the year 10 million of Kurt Vonnegut, Sirens, and Titan Museum and Archives are empty because they are crowning the living right off the earth.

45:01.213 --> 45:06.479
And a million year period is summed up in a single sentence in the history books.

45:06.499 --> 45:14.648
Guy Montag, a fireman in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, suffers a crisis when he discovers the content of the books he is burning

45:14.965 --> 45:21.253
and flees to join with a group who memorizes books in order to protect them from the authority.

45:21.273 --> 45:32.208
Long after a nuclear arc, a holocaust, a group of monks discover a sacred text, a shopping list, from pre-war years in a canicle for Lerowitz by Walter Miller.

45:33.570 --> 45:43.723
In George Warwick's Orwell's 1984, Winston Smith contends with a society in which everyone is always monitored and all information controlled by the government.

45:44.328 --> 45:54.018
Smith works in the government archives, altering records, and as he develops his own critical notions, purchases a book in order to start keeping admiring.

45:54.038 --> 45:57.962
And this, of course, is an unlawful act in that society.

45:57.982 --> 46:11.337
Now, these are all classic fictional accounts commenting on post-World War II society's concern with government control of information, the role of books and records in society, the nature of personal knowledge.

46:11.357 --> 46:12.698
They are also good stories.

46:13.606 --> 46:22.601
also replete with conspiracy, interesting characters, secret societies, humorous societies, and chilling similarities to present events.

46:23.362 --> 46:35.142
Now we have another story revolving around misguided government policies, well-meaning but hapless characters like Fremont Ryder, humorous antidotes about simplistic procedures and tests,

46:35.493 --> 46:50.751
And most of all, a vast conspiracy, and I just as an aside can't contend, you don't have to use the word conspiracy, convey a conspiracy, involving CIA operatives and those other powerful government agents, librarians.

46:50.771 --> 46:55.777
However, in this case, the story is true, or at least we're told it's true.

46:56.298 --> 47:00.403
And of course, I'm referring to the book, Double Poll, that we're talking about today.

47:00.991 --> 47:20.552
Instead of television screens in every room repeatedly showing government propaganda films, we have the creation of a widely shown film, Slow Fires, as being part of incessant propaganda by librarians and preservation administrators who have deceived the public into believing that paper becomes brutal and turns to dust.

47:21.207 --> 47:41.348
Now, perhaps some may have wondered whether Mr. Baker is playing with us, creating a work just like as you and I describing the supposed obsession with John Updike or real, I don't want to know, in which we must scratch our heads and wonder whether we should take Double Bold as fiction or nonfiction.

47:41.368 --> 47:47.434
One reviewer of Double Bold called the book resolutely absorbing and indicated that it reads like a spy novel.

47:47.954 --> 47:53.442
He is, of course, a witty and charming writer and a superb storyteller.

47:53.462 --> 48:06.019
While for some librarians and archivists, at least, he may anger us, we need to channel this anger into rethinking some of our assumptions and most certainly our approaches to how we explain ourselves to the public.

48:06.059 --> 48:15.953
Librarians and archivists, likewise, should use double-fold as an opportunity to explain themselves, especially as he, Mr. Baker, operates in influential public forums,

48:16.355 --> 48:20.841
and most librarians and archivists do not have access to them.

48:21.602 --> 48:31.594
Nicholson Baker is wrong, mostly, but you need to twist a bit, scratch around in your strongest opinions, and indulge in self-scrutiny to determine just why he is wrong.

48:33.096 --> 48:34.118
The pictures are neat.

48:34.418 --> 48:39.224
They're neat color photographs, but it's more than just about being neat stuff.

48:40.326 --> 48:45.332
And however, and this is a big however, if the public buys Baker's depiction,

48:45.633 --> 48:55.602
of libraries and archives, it will be more difficult to meet our mission, any mission, his or our, because it will be difficult to gather support for what we do.

48:56.403 --> 49:05.171
Archivists and librarians obviously need to be careful about how self-reflective we become when reading and responding to double-fold.

49:05.191 --> 49:13.378
As a result of the book, archives, historical manuscripts, rare books, and newspaper collections have become the subject of journalists, book reviewers,

49:13.561 --> 49:25.979
and radio and talk show hosts around the country, and many librarians and archivists may have wondered whether they were the focus of a fictional essay like Orwell or Vonnegut or Miller or Bradbury.

49:25.999 --> 49:37.395
Archivists and librarians are not just in the news, they are the news, thanks in part to his stature as a writer, his celebrity, and his access to publication outlets like the New Yorker.

49:37.856 --> 49:41.661
Librarians and archivists are being discussed in publications like the New York Times,

49:41.860 --> 49:48.429
Newsweek, the Christian Science Monitor, New York Review of Books, and the list goes on and grows every day.

49:48.449 --> 49:54.757
A stack of reviews and interviews and other materials now are beginning to fill a catwalk in the drawer.

49:55.258 --> 49:56.820
But something is amiss.

49:56.840 --> 50:07.054
Librarians and archivists are being attacked in the very area they thought they had gained substantial public support for the preservation of our documentary heritage.

50:07.074 --> 50:08.536
And they're not just being sniped in.

50:08.936 --> 50:10.298
They are under major seats.

50:10.767 --> 50:12.489
Perhaps one is just getting started.

50:12.950 --> 50:20.100
We are the vandals in the stacks destroying those precious newspapers before the public gets access to them.

50:20.121 --> 50:22.484
We are the slash and burn librarians.

50:22.985 --> 50:25.428
We are massacring books in all print.

50:25.869 --> 50:30.235
We are gas bibliobureaucrats, my favorite review.

50:30.496 --> 50:33.260
These are all terms not for the book.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.825
I have other of those terms to use.

50:36.845 --> 50:38.928
These are terms for the reviews.

50:38.948 --> 50:39.829
It's obvious that

50:40.197 --> 50:48.245
Mr. Baker's book is striking at the heart something that many feel passionately about, the maintenance of artifacts.

50:48.265 --> 50:56.312
But in this, we also discover that the public and Nicholson Baker fundamentally have a poor understanding of who and what we are.

50:58.595 --> 51:03.880
We can, of course, accept this, he states in his preface, that he is a lover of libraries.

51:03.900 --> 51:07.403
For a major literary figure that takes the time to write such a book,

51:07.518 --> 51:13.246
possibly require less potential financial gain and distraction from other writing projects.

51:13.266 --> 51:21.918
Cassidy has made a commitment to this challenge, that's on this challenge, because he's concerned about the fate of the books and newspapers he is writing about.

51:21.958 --> 51:27.426
Now, I'm not actually, I should say on the other side, I'm not sure about the business of selling books.

51:27.446 --> 51:36.478
I noticed that I went to Amazon, which runs the status of the sale brand.

51:36.847 --> 51:46.043
I noticed that double-fold is number 577 in the sales rank, whereas my best book in the sales rank is at number 761,000.

51:46.423 --> 51:56.260
So now we do not have a fan page on the web.

51:56.340 --> 52:00.728
We seem to be getting slaughtered here in the zoo.

52:00.978 --> 52:12.836
It's not that difficult to believe in his passion for his goals, since Double Bowl reveals that he is not just a fan of those who run libraries who make decisions about preservation and reformat.

52:13.317 --> 52:23.813
Just as librarians long ago discovered that they can convince the public to love books and even libraries, but not necessarily understand the professionals who manage them,

52:24.164 --> 52:35.359
So Mr. Baker has driven a wedge in between the objects, the books, and the places, libraries, where they are stored, and the people, librarians and preservation administrators, who administer them.

52:35.379 --> 52:37.762
Perhaps I'm simply being naive.

52:37.782 --> 52:48.256
The attention double-fold is received with its delicious tales of conspiracy and duplicity, but yet he really is into a new way to sell books, at least about libraries and art.

52:49.077 --> 52:53.783
In my view, Nicholson Baker does not fully understand the objects of his affections.

52:54.286 --> 52:59.672
at the heart of the whole world are assumptions about the mission of archivists and librarians.

53:00.113 --> 53:04.558
Archivists and librarians have been debating their mission for a long time.

53:04.578 --> 53:21.196
Librarians wrestling with the roles of their institutions and the information or knowledge of digital age, call it what you want, and archivists struggling with the symbolic or cultural aspects of their mission in relation to the value of records for purposes such as evidence and accountability.

53:21.236 --> 53:23.719
Librarians and archivists need to shoulder the blame

53:23.969 --> 53:28.233
for not explaining what they do and all those complexities to the public.

53:28.253 --> 53:31.477
They have tended to adopt simplistic messages.

53:31.497 --> 53:42.949
And some of this simplicity is evident in double quote, something both of us would not have worried about until Nicholson Baker started writing about librarians and archivists and their repositories.

53:42.969 --> 53:50.196
The public has, in fact, many perceptions of librarians and archives, seeing them as repositories of interesting stuff,

53:50.547 --> 54:00.040
documents for artifacts, all through the history, all through the memory and knowledge, or simply as one more source of entertainment.

54:00.060 --> 54:09.532
Although in this later one, libraries especially, may be losing out to the super bookstores with their coffee shops, easy chairs, and other diversions.

54:09.552 --> 54:17.483
Another weakness of double fault is the lack of distinction about types of libraries and the scope of other responsibilities and mandates.

54:17.834 --> 54:25.523
made by Mr. Baker when considering the flight of the preservation of the book, the newspaper, and the artifacts housed in the library.

54:26.244 --> 54:29.688
Archives are barely figured, really, in this book.

54:30.049 --> 54:38.639
One does not sense that he understands the difference between archives and libraries, and in fairness, not many outside these disciplines that perceive the differences.

54:39.280 --> 54:47.470
Certainly not how difficult it would be to scale up the preservation and access gauges posed by countless unique materials housed in archives

54:47.585 --> 54:52.332
and the growing challenges of electronic record-keeping systems.

54:52.352 --> 54:58.861
Indeed, one must acknowledge that he confuses things because when he focuses on libraries, he stresses their archival role.

54:59.322 --> 55:03.027
Parting that library and primary task is to be paper-deeper.

55:03.628 --> 55:08.715
This might be true for large libraries, like the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library,

55:08.965 --> 55:18.257
and some major academic research libraries around the country, but they represent only a fraction of all the libraries in existence.

55:18.277 --> 55:36.880
In the discussion about the book, he suggests that he is really only focused on major research libraries and the need for them to keep what they already have on the shelf, ignoring the fact that there are many kinds of research libraries and that many notable research collections are in smaller libraries and archival repositories.

55:37.231 --> 55:46.723
And that these libraries serve many other and often competing functions, ranging from community literacy programs to community social centers.

55:46.743 --> 55:53.452
For most libraries, the kind of issues that Mr. Baker discusses are out of scope for their daily operation.

55:54.153 --> 56:04.707
And when he does mention access, an issue that most librarians are very concerned about, there's limited to the kind of scholarship carried out in the elite academic or major research libraries.

56:05.429 --> 56:12.076
Libraries and archives have a much broader scope of concern than the very simple view of the world presented by Nicholson Baker.

56:12.777 --> 56:22.067
Archivists are concerned with the constantly evolving notions of records and their supporting technologies, the impact of these technologies and the reliability of records.

56:22.087 --> 56:29.074
Whether a society immersed in nostalgia and memory will remember to value archival records, whether records will be used,

56:29.425 --> 56:36.575
in effective ways or even at all, and the ethical challenges of managing increasingly complex and sensitive records.

56:37.256 --> 56:47.031
Librarians are concerned with how to provide access to a wide spectrum of users and information in a wide diversity of print, digital, and other resources.

56:47.271 --> 56:55.483
Censorship, threats of free speech and access information, and a changing sensitivities to how information sources are seen and used.

56:55.801 --> 57:01.730
And these are just broad categories of some of the contentious and complex issues we face.

57:02.251 --> 57:06.037
Libraries and archives are not just about shelves and warehouses.

57:06.057 --> 57:08.841
They are living and awkward endangered organizations.

57:09.883 --> 57:18.857
Managing libraries and archives is difficult, with competing priorities and needs and too few funds to meet all the needs and to solve all the problems.

57:18.877 --> 57:23.985
They need funds, staffs, space for organizing and cataloging, as well as storage.

57:24.320 --> 57:30.787
but certainly enabling access and ensuring security and environmentally stable buildings.

57:31.768 --> 57:44.863
There is little sense that there are differences between major research libraries and public libraries, or between archives and historical manuscripts and other repositories and print and documentary resources in double fold.

57:44.883 --> 57:53.533
Or even that major research libraries have faced substantial challenges in keeping their programs afloat as they try to build and maintain

57:53.682 --> 57:56.106
They're rare and specialized materials.

57:56.126 --> 58:00.794
The notion of saving originals, as he argues, must be weighed against us in such matters.

58:01.095 --> 58:06.484
The irony is that these originals are the care of all these kinds of repositions.

58:06.504 --> 58:14.037
Now, I don't want the debate to degenerate until merely the matter of I am a professional and Eve is an amateur.

58:17.746 --> 58:22.073
of professionalism as being somehow elitist and anti-democrat.

58:22.093 --> 58:25.318
And there are tings of this throughout the Baker book.

58:25.338 --> 58:28.002
And I must say, this sells books too.

58:28.022 --> 58:32.929
And I do not want to raise the spectrum of wild issues being addressed in double quote.

58:32.949 --> 58:39.780
Yet the essence of being an expert is in mastering a specialized body of knowledge, of using that knowledge for a public good.

58:40.240 --> 58:45.188
While he argues that there is a breach of trust between the public and librarians and archivists,

58:45.826 --> 58:50.833
Noble Paul makes his arguments without fully knowing what librarians and archivists do.

58:51.474 --> 58:55.360
He does not understand the distinction between librarians and archivists.

58:55.380 --> 59:12.424
He notes, for example, that a true archive must be able to tolerate years of relative inattention, neglecting the reflect of the fact that archives must be carefully monitored to ensure that mold, rodents, and other problems do not attack those precious paper documents

59:12.742 --> 59:22.515
or that archives are dealing with electronic record-keeping systems requiring intervention at the point of their creation and design considerable monitoring and use thereafter.

59:23.096 --> 59:33.770
And even more importantly, such a view fails in understanding that archives are repositories of evidence ensuring accountability and building and sustaining a societal memory.

59:34.310 --> 59:37.855
In other words, archives become places of relative inattention

59:38.054 --> 59:42.802
at the peril of the loss of essence of what makes community, government, and nations.

59:43.663 --> 59:49.632
He also expresses no concern about such matters, perhaps because he has another cause for focus.

59:49.652 --> 59:56.043
For the public, newspapers are old records, and old records must be what archivists are caring for behind their walls.

59:56.443 --> 59:59.148
In this sense, libraries and archives are like museums.

59:59.588 --> 59:59.909
Really?

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:05.698
In an interview, when asked about the role of the university research library, he stated,

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:09.700
that the job of the research library is to keep the stuff that people read.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.502
And that's a very simple task.

01:00:12.363 --> 01:00:14.465
Notice people use this as a simple task.

01:00:14.705 --> 01:00:23.455
Yet the increasing scholarship when reading, those have difficulties to determine who has read what, even if something has been read at all.

01:00:23.955 --> 01:00:29.261
If a research library only kept what people read, they would be very small places indeed.

01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:35.027
Because most of what sits on the shelves are rarely involved in something else.

01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:54.973
The shelves would be filled with multiple copies of popular novels, have two manuals, dummies and idiot guides, self-help publications, and other similar currently popular materials that might not be popular or even consulted in the future because they're designed, like our computers and other electronic devices, to have short lifespan.

01:00:55.534 --> 01:01:00.259
So what is he going after in his crusade?

01:01:00.479 --> 01:01:04.744
Archivists and librarians can't afford to be dismissive for condescending

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:08.967
of the paper process that has risen in their midst.

01:01:08.987 --> 01:01:18.580
He already has his followers, all those people glued to the television set every week, watching Antiques Roadshow, receiving their vids on eBay.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:30.055
He also has some supporters from within the library and archives communities who believe that paper is the most stable medium by which to maintain documents, information, evidence found in those sources.

01:01:31.177 --> 01:01:33.600
There is certainly some truth in this kind of argument,

01:01:33.935 --> 01:01:39.545
But this is very different, I believe, than the exaggerated case that he has built over the past few years.

01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:48.040
Reading his book reminds me when I asked a friend about the movie on Ike and Tina Turner's lives and careers released a few years ago.

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:56.415
My friend reflected for a moment and summarized the movie, what's all got to do with it in case those of you want to go to the video store later,

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.132
Summarize the movie this way.

01:01:58.533 --> 01:02:03.080
Ike was very, very bad, and Tina was very, very good.

01:02:04.802 --> 01:02:09.269
Nixon Baker, librarian, except for those who agree with him, were very, very bad.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.033
Although libraries were very, very good.

01:02:12.594 --> 01:02:18.002
After reading Double Bold, one might also wonder, what's love got to do with it?

01:02:18.022 --> 01:02:24.732
The so-called information age has done weird things to us regarding how we perceive information and its value.

01:02:24.998 --> 01:02:41.819
Perhaps Stovofold is merely a product in this strange time, when we seem to be straddled between print and digital information, between an interest in the tactile pleasures of artifacts and the convenient but certainly sterile uses of information via keyboard and screen.

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:49.889
On the one hand, technologists keep dreaming up ways to preserve everything, some even seeing religious significance in their work.

01:02:49.909 --> 01:02:52.052
The present, everything should be saved.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:58.709
The information age has thrown librarians and archivists into a spin about what they need to be doing.

01:02:58.729 --> 01:03:02.192
Librarians are asked to be information professionals.

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:05.576
Can librarians do this and also preserve all those original?

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:12.964
Archivists work under a mission to identify, preserve, and make available for use records of continuing value.

01:03:13.444 --> 01:03:20.031
And this continuing value encompasses the maintenance of records for accountability, corporate social memory, and evidence.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:22.952
all the benefit to protect citizens.

01:03:22.972 --> 01:03:27.216
Can archivists only account of this by preserving original?

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:34.023
Maybe Nicholson Baker is really worried about something else, and it is a concern that certainly any author has said before.

01:03:34.483 --> 01:03:47.335
Perhaps he is worried that in 50 or 100 years, his writing, his book, won't be on the shelves of libraries and books for it, or the memory banks of computers that might be supporting the walls of libraries and publishers.

01:03:47.939 --> 01:04:02.976
I remember a conversation some time ago about the odd moments of Ray Cudswell's book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, as he wistfully wrote about immortality being in breach by an injection of our consciousness into the computer's hard drive.

01:04:02.996 --> 01:04:13.407
A colleague, swallowing his mouth full of food, you can only have these discussions over lunch, kindly surmised that Cudswell, who he knew, was beginning to think about his own mortality.

01:04:13.792 --> 01:04:28.367
Perhaps Nicholson Baker is worried that his writing will not outlast him very long, although he obviously has a better shot of it than I, suspectfully as he views libraries and archives being selective in what they preserve.

01:04:28.807 --> 01:04:43.782
Indeed, I know some librarians and archivists who are already testing the durability of double-perm fold construction and lamenting that Random House printed the book on acid-free paper.

01:04:44.116 --> 01:04:54.252
Why can't librarians and archivists preserve all this stuff and keep it in its original form?

01:04:54.493 --> 01:05:01.324
Well, it seems they should be able to do this because librarians and archivists have been very, very busy, it seems.

01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:08.335
Double Falls focuses on what is to be done in libraries and archives, although the emphasis is on libraries and books and newspapers.

01:05:08.669 --> 01:05:16.660
Specifically, the use of microfilming in the subsequent volumes of newspapers and books are reformatting in order to preserve their content.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:24.832
Microfilm has been a poor choice, resulting in poor copies and leading to the massive destruction of books and newspapers.

01:05:24.852 --> 01:05:33.203
His colorful language suggests that these libraries and other institutions have produced a historical record compromising to speak.

01:05:33.624 --> 01:05:36.668
A clean-out of the library, a strip-mined history,

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:43.499
Double Bowl is not a mere critique of the preservation methods of librarians.

01:05:43.519 --> 01:05:47.085
Instead, it's books were conspiracy compliance.

01:05:47.105 --> 01:05:55.677
Perhaps he is sincere in his convictions or simply frustrated with all that I spoke thoroughly about the preservation mandate, for maybe he knows the conspiracy sell better.

01:05:55.998 --> 01:06:03.730
Would a book critiquing library and archives preservation minus the conspiracy be featured on the pages of the leading newspapers and book review albums?

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:04.731
Probably not.

01:06:04.863 --> 01:06:14.735
His faith would be to exist as an internal document discussed and debated deep within the professional journals and conferences with a sales forecast measured in the hundreds.

01:06:14.755 --> 01:06:33.739
He may have given us the opportunity and motivation, indeed the absolute necessity, to speak out in a much more public forum, not merely as advocates for a particular position, but as explainers of complex and difficult responsibilities faced by the librarian, archivists, and preservation administrators.

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:38.913
There are weaknesses in this book, and they may prove the weakness we get.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:47.002
The most obvious is his effective against those he sees as responsible for the tobacco he insists that happens.

01:06:47.022 --> 01:06:58.414
He repeatedly mentions the incessant library propaganda wasted on the public, clearly arguing that men lied, and just importantly tried to conceal the evidence of their misdeeds.

01:06:58.434 --> 01:07:04.080
Those of us who have been interested in teaching and reaching the public about the necessity of preservation of books,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:10.430
had probably viewed this preservation advocacy as major exemplary successes.

01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:20.145
He argues that the architects of this preservation movement have been secretive, like weapons procurers in the Department of Defense.

01:07:20.325 --> 01:07:31.182
And his constant references to the CIA, federal funding, and even some of those people who work in tobacco companies and other features of the preservation movement all seem rather

01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:41.552
What is missed is, of course, that the entire foundation of the information science field and computer industry was built at this time under similar circumstances.

01:07:41.572 --> 01:07:50.661
Are we participating in a conspiracy every time we use a Korean computer to write an essay, send an email message, or look for information on the web?

01:07:51.462 --> 01:07:54.785
He's not a lunatic, and he uses computers, as does his publisher.

01:07:55.185 --> 01:07:59.970
So he also, as part of the Korean conspiracy, hatched deep into a secret room

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:01.313
and the Pentagon.

01:08:01.334 --> 01:08:10.528
And given that the post-World War II plans for that building was to turn it into a federal record center, I know that the tentacles of this conspiracy are long.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:22.908
If this sounds silly, so does the connecting of the use of microfilm in libraries and archives to a breach of public trust in libraries and archives and presentations.

01:08:22.928 --> 01:08:24.831
He levels serious charges.

01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:28.236
Library administrators, according to him, have not been doing their job.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:36.277
participating in a slow betrayal of an unknowing nation and destroying whatever trust the public should have had in them.

01:08:36.337 --> 01:08:47.167
Most importantly, he goes after the Brittle-Wooks effort, berating both the notion of Brittle and the idea that books were going to turn into dust and the crisis produced by the problem.

01:08:47.187 --> 01:08:50.370
Where is he at to predict an apocalypse of paper?

01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:58.257
He may be way too creative a writer for his own good when he tries to figure out how and why these decisions were being made.

01:08:58.372 --> 01:09:19.939
Perhaps his next book might be a diatribe against the entire advertising industry, because it seems that he's mostly upset that librarians pushed a program that has been reasonably successful in reformatted newspaper books and other traditional print resources that seemed endangered and that he sees some evidence from being somewhat exaggerated.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.565
Ultimately, his anecdotal descriptions of books declare to be brittle

01:09:24.697 --> 01:09:37.196
decade before that are still found to be existing and worse that turn up the accession mark and command hefty prices as collectibles really miss the point that not all books are worth saving.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:49.455
That market prices, which are hardly rational, could play a minor role in the preservation effort and that libraries and archives have other priorities and limited funds, and limited support.

01:09:49.739 --> 01:10:02.470
While the great collectors assembled collections that became major additions to research libraries and archives, much of what now passes for collecting is driven by a commodities approach with interest only in monetary value.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.792
How many people buy a rare book and read it?

01:10:05.132 --> 01:10:08.715
Probably as many as buy a rare wine and drink it.

01:10:09.296 --> 01:10:17.443
These are often investments and as such they are hardly evidence of some breach of faith and a covenant between librarians and the public.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.784
Now there are various flavors

01:10:19.017 --> 01:10:21.180
in the concoction of double pull.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:28.329
At times, one gets a sense of well-intentioned, but misguided decision-making operating within the library.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:37.640
He mentions that librarians were involved in impetuously technophilic decisions and often operated within a full futuristic swing.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.363
What librarians and what libraries?

01:10:40.383 --> 01:10:45.750
Well, yes, we know that they replace card catalogs with online public access catalogs.

01:10:46.169 --> 01:10:59.183
But despite his plea that civilization was ending with the loss of those printed, handwritten, and sometimes cataloged, those individuals seemed pleased to have enhanced access to libraries across the world.

01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:04.589
These libraries bet too much on what microfilm would do for them and how well it would work.

01:11:04.829 --> 01:11:12.497
More often, however, the librarians in double-fold come across as evil or as dupes or just plain stupid.

01:11:12.517 --> 01:11:13.999
The source of the book's title

01:11:14.485 --> 01:11:21.532
test long used for determining how brittle both stages may be, is a good example of how he approaches the subject.

01:11:21.552 --> 01:11:35.026
Seeing it as an instrument of deception, almost always of self-deception, can be used by no one with any real intelligence because it is intended to tell administrators precisely what they want to hear.

01:11:35.326 --> 01:11:42.113
The folk test has become an easy way for libraries to free up shelves with a clear conscience.

01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:47.486
The double-fold test is words, other horseshit and craziness.

01:11:47.506 --> 01:11:49.508
Good sound bites.

01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:56.996
Incidentally, I tried the title of my review that the SAA published, Other horseshit and Craziness.

01:11:57.056 --> 01:12:02.461
They became to me that there are a lot of nuns who are members of the Society of American Archivists.

01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:05.504
They suggested a different title.

01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:09.248
So much for literary creativity.

01:12:09.953 --> 01:12:13.679
Yet the truth is that millions of books were printed on poor paper.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:21.592
And the fact that Mr. Baker can find some that still seem to have life left in them is nice, but not very convincing.

01:12:21.933 --> 01:12:30.026
We can amass thousands of counterexamples and evidence to demonstrate that repeated use of books and newspapers might be their last use.

01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:33.733
And some of us in this room, perhaps, have experienced this.

01:12:33.753 --> 01:12:36.417
Now, no one will acknowledge the mistakes were made.

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:44.034
will not acknowledge that mistakes were made with microfilm, especially in producing poor images we saw in samples.

01:12:44.054 --> 01:12:48.239
Or even some of the arguments for preservation of the students were overstated.

01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:56.167
But it is one thing to criticize and no problems, and quite another to denounce the intentions of what librarians and archivists are doing.

01:12:56.647 --> 01:13:01.772
At present, there are rigid technical standards in place for microfilming and preserving paper.

01:13:01.793 --> 01:13:05.256
And the existence of these standards may be the result of warning

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.493
from the earlier mistakes.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:16.707
If he intended for his essays and books to help us to continue to learn and to make adjustments, its tone and message seem counterproductive.

01:13:16.867 --> 01:13:23.297
Librarians and archivists can hardly expect to embrace a plot line in which they are the villains.

01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:33.893
Librarians and archivists select, provide access, organize and catalog, preserve, promote their services, and manage increasingly complicated and diverse operations.

01:13:34.092 --> 01:13:48.151
all in the space of the lack of resources, lack of public understanding, rapidly changing technologies, societal debates, controversies, changing constituencies, internal professional debates, and new demands for services.

01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:56.843
The public may not fully understand what libraries and archives do, but they often expect services from them that stretch their resources.

01:13:57.059 --> 01:14:12.838
While Mr. Baker focuses on both the single function of preservation, as if this is all libraries and archives are about, librarians and archivists have had to respond to rising expectations that everything will be made available for this organization.

01:14:12.858 --> 01:14:23.151
Preservation and access are linked, so the focus of double fold on the maintenance of the regionals and cheap warehouse space in out-of-the-way places is somewhat replaced.

01:14:23.789 --> 01:14:29.394
Double Fault takes one particular test and makes it the centerpiece of a grand conspiracy.

01:14:29.414 --> 01:14:34.298
And again, I submit, the language is a language that suggests a conspiracy.

01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:52.294
Baker really believes that the entire preservation movement, or seems to suggest that the entire preservation movement, seems to believe that the entire preservation movement in the past couple of generations has been part of an effort merely to show, say, shelf space, an argument he repeats in every available opportunity.

01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:59.139
The newspaper microfilming has, according to NASA, a great, beautiful, and power, and meaning to the landscape of the novel.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.604
And again, we saw the pictures demonstrating this view.

01:15:02.964 --> 01:15:11.016
And the emergence of the Little Books program is part of an effort to divert attention away from the obvious failures in microfilms.

01:15:11.036 --> 01:15:14.120
He makes it all sound so plausible and so bad.

01:15:14.661 --> 01:15:19.648
He even ignores the fact that many of these librarians, archivists, are scholars in their own right.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:27.935
making judicious decisions in the face of difficult circumstances, and nearly all are experts building on the hard scrabble of experience.

01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:35.307
Mistakes may be made, but they are not being made as a result of some vast conspiracy, ignorance, or malfeasance.

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:43.881
The fundamental weakness of the argument may be more implicit than explicit that everything can and must be saved in a traditional state.

01:15:44.131 --> 01:15:56.262
At times, it seems that he communicates that he simply wants one copy of everything that has already been acquired from certain research libraries, kept in its original pristine condition in these repositories.

01:15:56.282 --> 01:16:04.689
But I am not sure that there is fundamentally much difference in the scale he is considering from that of just saving everything, both seem impossible.

01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:13.817
How, for example, could such a vast coordination of delegating responsibility among thousands of libraries and archives, from millions and millions of books

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.373
newspapers and other materials in place.

01:16:17.215 --> 01:16:23.924
As an archivist, this is my concern with the book and with the reviews and interviews and the publicity.

01:16:23.944 --> 01:16:37.003
Baker wants these newspapers in the original because the size of the typical newspaper is important because microfilm projects usually do not capture all the various editions many urban dailies produce.

01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:39.743
We need every edition of every newspaper.

01:16:39.904 --> 01:16:41.645
Now, in the book, that's what's said.

01:16:41.986 --> 01:16:46.070
I haven't found the reference again, but that's what's stated.

01:16:46.591 --> 01:17:01.185
Events frustration that microfilm, at least at May Day, was filled with a link with destruction and with a defunding divergence, that's a quote, between conservation and preservation, where one involves stating originals and the other their destruction.

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:05.590
He wants the paper saved because he believes that we need to study the physical history

01:17:05.924 --> 01:17:08.648
durability of early wood pulp paper.

01:17:08.668 --> 01:17:12.555
Archivists though, however, are saying that every item is not possible.

01:17:12.575 --> 01:17:15.379
We can't even examine all the records.

01:17:15.399 --> 01:17:22.511
And the archivists and their allies have been developing selection schemes and strategy for years as a means to cope with such challenges.

01:17:23.132 --> 01:17:32.607
Even if we chose to treat original newspapers, there is still the matter of financial and other resources required that makes this less an option than

01:17:32.806 --> 01:17:40.116
that Nicholson Baker seems to be able to understand, perhaps because the book's message would have to become more complex.

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:52.713
Making an argument, everything should be saved is a powerful one and is easier to make than trying to wrestle about who will have responsibility for selection and what criteria will be used.

01:17:53.253 --> 01:18:00.383
Now the one true hero in double book might look for a hero and knew there had to be one somewhere.

01:18:00.599 --> 01:18:04.503
Seems to be the bibliographer and print scholar, he kind of stands out.

01:18:04.523 --> 01:18:10.489
For those that all books are physical artifacts without exception, just as all books are bowls of ideas.

01:18:10.969 --> 01:18:12.250
So save it all.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:18.957
Yes, books are content and manufactured object, information, and sometimes art, propaganda, and commodity.

01:18:19.337 --> 01:18:22.761
This certainly suggests a need for outfishing for resource of books.

01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:30.268
But it does not necessarily apply to be saved all books, so that we can scale this up to accomplish something .

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:37.076
Not everything of value, some scholars far distant in the future, maybe, can be saved for posterior.

01:18:37.857 --> 01:18:43.562
Librarians and archivists must make choices, hard as this might seem, and this is complex.

01:18:44.102 --> 01:18:48.847
Yes, some scholarship requires original artifacts, but what about other challenges?

01:18:49.387 --> 01:19:00.357
That the digitally born objects and record system, the other research purposes, serve by records that extend far beyond the scholarship on books, printing, and other related matters.

01:19:00.826 --> 01:19:12.159
Government archives are saving records to ensure accountability so that we know that Bill Clinton gave the moniker a copy of a certain book written by the person sitting next to me.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:20.589
Corporate records management programs are administering record-keeping systems to ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:29.820
The world, at least that for libraries and archives, may be a bit more complex than what Nicholson Baker does or appears to consider.

01:19:30.138 --> 01:19:34.003
Archivists know that saving everything is simply impossible.

01:19:34.063 --> 01:19:43.155
At this point, Baker's may be what has the most resonance with the public because as one reviewer stated, nothing beats the original.

01:19:43.315 --> 01:19:50.044
Mr. Baker pleads that we leave the book alone and alone and alone and alone.

01:19:50.144 --> 01:19:51.846
That's exactly how it's said.

01:19:51.866 --> 01:19:56.653
And by the time you finish the book or finish listening to him, you might agree.

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:58.575
But consider the weakness of this.

01:19:58.808 --> 01:20:22.588
just letting everything accumulate and leaving it there in its original form assumes that libraries and archives do not make selections to begin with baker constantly focuses on the library congress is serving as a repository for all printed copyright books that there are not accidents and catastrophes that we have such natural accumulations or that many most

01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:27.176
Books that are attached will not be used for decades or more, or perhaps not used at all.

01:20:27.596 --> 01:20:33.362
We cannot keep everything, and barely trying to do so weakens our ability to keep anything.

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:42.251
Regardless of what some might argue, not every book, pamphlet, newspaper, or document is important enough to merit perpetual care.

01:20:42.632 --> 01:20:45.915
Do we have to keep an original copy of double books?

01:20:45.935 --> 01:20:49.539
Do we have to keep an original copy of one of my books?

01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:50.500
I don't think so.

01:20:50.986 --> 01:21:02.583
And librarians and archivists, even if they were just in the business of running warehouses, could not store everything or even a substantial portion of everything published or created.

01:21:03.184 --> 01:21:15.682
While Mr. Baker provides some simple cost estimates that deserve to be answered, the problem of his estimates is that he does not factor in all of the resources or kinds of resources that would be needed.

01:21:15.703 --> 01:21:20.790
Specialized staff, adequate storage facilities, not just warehouses, adequate

01:21:21.108 --> 01:21:29.778
storage facilities, reading rooms, equipment for copying, and other similar items and functions are not considered in the pages of double poli.

01:21:30.439 --> 01:21:35.665
And these libraries are similar places than they are or ever have been in the real world.

01:21:35.845 --> 01:21:50.102
And in addition, what some are calling history, some are calling double poli history, perhaps because it has footnotes, describes many procedures, policies, and processes that date back many years, and that have been.

01:21:50.268 --> 01:21:55.055
corrected, updated, or replaced with better approaches.

01:21:55.356 --> 01:22:09.998
It is just as likely that what we have experienced over the past half century, both successes and failures, have prepared us for new approaches that might not have come into play if we had not stumbled about looking for and experimenting.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:29.115
While one might easily interpret from double-fold that librarians and archivists should proceed with caution, especially as future technologies might help resolve some of the challenges of preserving originals, the lesson not appreciated is the complexity of the responsibilities faced by librarians and archivists.

01:22:29.135 --> 01:22:36.846
Nicholson Baker and double-fold needs and deserves responses that reexample scientific evidence from rural papers.

01:22:37.197 --> 01:22:39.160
scientific evidence.

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:44.427
The history of microfilming and World Book Program, both what they have accomplished and the failures.

01:22:44.447 --> 01:22:54.041
The responses of researchers and other users, especially considering the use of microfilm newspapers and the use of original papers.

01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:58.367
The economics of preservation and libraries and archives in general.

01:22:58.828 --> 01:23:06.158
The need for types of selection criteria for devoting extraordinary resources to preserving particular original

01:23:06.577 --> 01:23:13.708
the need for an effectiveness of preservation and conservation education, and numerous other issues.

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:20.458
We need to respond carefully to the many levels of his arguments, and his arguments are complex and comprehensive.

01:23:20.478 --> 01:23:26.627
Perhaps it would not be a bad idea to call moratorium, briefly, on the major reformatting project.

01:23:26.647 --> 01:23:34.980
So we can discuss these issues, do some study, consider the obvious, and at the least, why not divert some of the billions of federal foundation funding

01:23:35.247 --> 01:23:38.131
to study some of the kinds of questions that he was raised.

01:23:38.391 --> 01:23:45.860
Or, perhaps, he can help us tap into the foundation funding sources that he needed to support his own newspaper archive.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:24:04.883
And yes, it is ironic that the criticisms he makes about the external government funding to support the insidious microfilming and brittle book project does not direct attention to the responsibility of newspaper and book publishers for creating generations of cheap, poorly manufactured and ephemeral objects.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:16.612
Why target librarians and archivists who have been stuck with these objects rather than their manufacturers, especially since the former, because of their campaigns, have managed to get better products?

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:29.525
Why target librarians and archivists when they are the ones trying now to work with the computer hardware and software manufacturers so that better, more durable e-books and digital record systems are available?

01:24:30.105 --> 01:24:32.828
Study and careful analysis is what we need.

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:34.990
not unsubstantiated charges.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:42.320
Is it exaggeration that brittle paper will literally turn books into dust?

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.322
Of course.

01:24:43.342 --> 01:24:43.903
So what?

01:24:44.844 --> 01:24:53.016
Baker provides a lot of anecdotal evidence, mostly from his own personal experience and observation, some of it quite propelling and intriguing.

01:24:53.036 --> 01:24:59.625
But we need to examine in analytical, not scientific fashion, the extent of deterioration of paper.

01:24:59.892 --> 01:25:08.220
While it appears that the proponents of reformatting books in those newspapers may have overstated their case, Baker surely has overstated his.

01:25:08.761 --> 01:25:17.450
Preserving original newspapers across the world does seem excessive unless undertaken as a very selective exercise.

01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.393
Do some researchers complain about using viper milk?

01:25:20.653 --> 01:25:20.933
Yes.

01:25:21.073 --> 01:25:22.274
Again, so what?

01:25:22.735 --> 01:25:27.840
I've talked to archivists who tell me of patrons complaining about having to use original newspapers.

01:25:28.259 --> 01:25:35.028
So I and others can also compile a substantial evidence on the other side of the argument as well.

01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:42.919
A minor thing in this book, although no less emotional or intense, is the role of education in the crisis he is describing.

01:25:42.939 --> 01:25:47.204
And it seems appropriate here to discuss this a little bit.

01:25:47.224 --> 01:25:56.697
Akram used to know the fact that the book conservative, the one most likely to stage the original artifact, must go through a slow friendship, slow preservation administrator,

01:25:56.997 --> 01:26:11.994
The one they can do is reformatting the student, quote, but an extra year to earn the right to decide or help decide what to do with a stack full of artifacts about which he or she might know almost nothing in the book.

01:26:12.014 --> 01:26:21.324
Another point he asserts, there is a direct correlation between the correct spread of preservation administration and career as a widening pull in the whole book.

01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:23.967
Now, most of us have operated on a different level.

01:26:24.335 --> 01:26:32.747
regarding preservation, assuming the main problem was that there were too few preservation administrators out there in the first place.

01:26:33.848 --> 01:26:42.941
Of course, adopting his argument that we should just leave the books in the stacks and not bother with them suggests eliminating the education that we already have in place.

01:26:43.301 --> 01:26:51.152
I do believe we have a major educational venture for us, but not merely retraining new kinds of preservation administrators.

01:26:51.503 --> 01:27:05.664
But in explaining to the public and policy makers the nature of library and archival preservation, we also need to be able to educate our friends to people like Mr. Baker who declare that they love libraries and archives.

01:27:05.684 --> 01:27:15.219
Now, in the interest of time, I have another dozen pages that I was going to talk about the selection of newspapers to be preserved in the original.

01:27:15.239 --> 01:27:20.667
I'm going to skip over that because I do believe that some of the examples that we've seen up here, that there are cases

01:27:20.832 --> 01:27:24.376
that we do need to preserve certain original newspapers.

01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:31.885
But in a highly selective and very careful process, a highly selective way, very careful process, and not all newspapers.

01:27:31.905 --> 01:27:37.732
Again, the examples in double bulk are always focused on certain kinds of major newspapers.

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:42.178
But we know that there are thousands and thousands of dailies out there.

01:27:42.198 --> 01:27:43.419
We also know that the U.S.

01:27:43.439 --> 01:27:48.325
Newspaper Project, it was not just about the newspaper

01:27:48.575 --> 01:27:57.248
but an amazing effort to gather the bibliographic information about the complexities of the newspapers that are out there, that again is not reflected.

01:27:57.308 --> 01:28:07.563
Again, because there is a disconnect between the notion of preservation and access in the book, and I think in the arguments that we know that are quite vital.

01:28:07.683 --> 01:28:09.786
But I'm not going to obviously use up the time.

01:28:10.007 --> 01:28:17.738
Let me just skip to my last page of the app here, and then open it up for

01:28:18.730 --> 01:28:26.479
Well, whatever's going to happen next.

01:28:26.499 --> 01:28:27.781
There's no door behind that.

01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:28.141
I'm worried.

01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.184
In effect, OK, this is the conclusion.

01:28:30.344 --> 01:28:47.725
In effect, Nicholson Baker's writings are a lament about the loss of older sensibility to original material, one generated by our emerging into an acceptance of copies by the internet or wide web that he and others worry may have dulled our senses

01:28:48.008 --> 01:28:50.550
about the value of original objects.

01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:57.957
His article and his book are much like the worry of Sven Birkitz about the divide of both the print book and linear reading.

01:28:58.397 --> 01:29:15.653
However, one can believe in the continuing utility of print and the value of maintaining books and some newspapers in their original position while recognizing that the ultimate preservation demands requires mechanisms like microfilming and digitization.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.401
projects.

01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:17.462
There is need for both.

01:29:17.663 --> 01:29:18.364
I love books.

01:29:18.384 --> 01:29:22.670
I have about three or four thousand in my own library.

01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:24.793
I don't have any newspapers.

01:29:25.614 --> 01:29:34.888
There is no conspiracy or even tragic problems in our libraries and archives, other than the fact that they have immense challenges and limited resources.

01:29:34.908 --> 01:29:40.577
He might think of himself calling others to join an epic quest to save America's past.

01:29:40.597 --> 01:29:44.863
But at best, he will only give a minute to a portion, perhaps even to burn

01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:52.537
the public's attention from the greater issues facing the preservation of the books, documents, newspapers, and other artifacts in the past.

01:29:52.617 --> 01:29:55.701
He reminds me, unfortunately, of Sisyphus.

01:29:55.721 --> 01:30:07.657
What all of this leads up to is the need to use the same standard for evaluating his books that he himself employs to evaluate preservation efforts of the past half century.

01:30:07.677 --> 01:30:10.680
He critiques the film, Slow Fire to Dispassion.

01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:12.623
It would be a better film

01:30:12.873 --> 01:30:23.106
If what it was saying happened to be truth, not head-slapping exaggeration, then its use of crisis language would have some justification.

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:30.976
This applies, the same applies, of course, to determining just how exaggerated a double-fold word is.

01:30:30.996 --> 01:30:33.399
Certainly, he thinks a crisis also exists.

01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:41.749
I think the exaggeration comes and is a characterization of some individuals in the more conspiratorial aspects of his argument.

01:30:42.117 --> 01:30:51.291
The truth addressed somewhere in his arguments about the massive microfilming and digitization of books that may not be as endangered as we were led to believe.

01:30:51.311 --> 01:31:01.627
But there was an awful lot of superfluous tit-chat speculation and conspiracy theorizing to dig through, in order to find, to crawl into that truth.

01:31:01.647 --> 01:31:01.847
Thank you.

01:31:23.056 --> 01:31:45.509
We would like to go to the floor now to questions from a pair of two people with microphones.

01:31:45.529 --> 01:31:46.130
Is there someone on your side?

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.032
If you guys don't mind, go back and do that.

01:31:47.052 --> 01:31:47.232
Oh, sure.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:47.352
Okay.

01:31:47.372 --> 01:31:47.813
Anybody want to start?

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:47.933
Okay.

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:57.240
between the public and libraries.

01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:07.819
And so the question that I have for Mr. Baker is the point that libraries need to be held to a higher standard of trust.

01:32:07.839 --> 01:32:09.622
We need to raise a level of accountability.

01:32:10.363 --> 01:32:15.312
Or is the point that there was a level of trust that has been briefed?

01:32:15.793 --> 01:32:19.540
And if it's the latter, could you give us examples of what you've been able to find

01:32:19.807 --> 01:32:26.232
that were actual statements of some evidence of trust, whether it's legal contact, policy, it doesn't matter.

01:32:26.293 --> 01:32:39.464
But what can we really point to as a measure of a statement of an obligation that we really need to look to when we critique behavior in action?

01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:49.172
Well, I think the reason that I became indignant writing the book was because when I found, I think, the Brittle Books program,

01:32:49.523 --> 01:32:56.331
was presented to us and presented to many librarians as a way of saving the human record.

01:32:56.911 --> 01:33:04.920
And so what I did was go back and read the actual documents, the cost-benefit analysis on which this program was based.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:10.306
And in reading them, it turns out that the number one benefit to it is face-saving.

01:33:11.648 --> 01:33:17.995
And if you microfilm these endangered, at-risk, embrittled books as diagnosed with these

01:33:18.346 --> 01:33:25.099
variations on the fold test that you will then allow libraries to liberate five times that.
