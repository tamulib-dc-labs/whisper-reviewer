00:07.777 --> 00:23.763
And Laura Ingalls was with a history scene, a poem, a piece with me.

00:23.783 --> 00:26.427
And she brought it to an order, although if things might have trailed off, it was already to move forward immediately to the period.

00:26.407 --> 00:43.926
And I got a funny feeling about how the austere Christodemus had left a caring and open personality there, and by his head, there were some reactions to him.

00:45.070 --> 01:03.211
But when I had a certain experience in my life and thought I wanted to continue learning more about the climate, Kelly Martin suggested strongly that I study with Gloria.

01:04.152 --> 01:06.775
And I thought, oh my, that's it.

01:07.261 --> 01:17.901
She was very liberal about that.

01:17.921 --> 01:28.881
In fact, there were so many facets between her particular, austerity and virginity that are interesting.

01:28.861 --> 01:40.277
Um, she was, I don't think she ran out of tight shape, but she came in, you know, I'm going to make your work area.

01:40.297 --> 01:46.886
And I was also thrilled to be most of them here.

01:46.906 --> 01:50.331
So, at that point, she was still in some basement, I love you, that's open.

01:50.351 --> 01:52.894
She must have been called Mrs. Young in the classroom before it was all happened.

01:52.874 --> 01:57.784
Oh, members are healthy.

01:57.804 --> 02:02.533
Actually, I have to go with that.

02:04.597 --> 02:09.085
But she is a clear young woman.

02:09.106 --> 02:10.107
She looks at her.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.452
She is from North Carolina looking to meet her apprentice.

02:12.652 --> 02:16.701
And I'm just a person with great skills all day.

02:19.046 --> 02:26.241
And then it was, they needed to call it a sentence.

02:26.261 --> 02:30.711
Students would come and go.

02:31.045 --> 02:35.830
was it was so difficult.

02:36.191 --> 02:47.323
But it was never a reprimand.

02:47.483 --> 02:55.973
She was wonderful about it, and you say even a dumb one.

02:55.953 --> 03:00.651
And she said, well, I think we'll keep you here.

03:00.671 --> 03:01.457
It's great.

03:02.382 --> 03:15.136
We just put a dog sheet in which was clear.

03:15.156 --> 03:23.386
I didn't look at how bad most of it was except when I let myself down.

03:24.347 --> 03:29.993
She started out making me clear that you should do the best you can.

03:30.125 --> 03:35.632
And even if it's a mess, she'll show you how it is.

03:35.772 --> 03:37.835
But we're going to get over there.

03:37.855 --> 03:43.842
Or just take that off and reposition it.

03:43.862 --> 03:45.204
What's the difference?

03:45.224 --> 03:52.453
And it's the best thing in practicing a criminal is to not let something go out.

03:52.433 --> 04:03.305
I do appreciate that.

04:05.408 --> 04:14.678
Lori had another child, but I hung it out every year and found them all.

04:14.658 --> 04:25.578
to be in Wisconsin for six months and she was always good about doing the thing that I didn't get to find her.

04:25.598 --> 04:34.455
And so, three years ago, she had, first of all, she was a former teacher.

04:34.435 --> 04:43.264
She really had that pedagogical history.

04:43.284 --> 04:54.174
It was so necessary to impart information with patients, and also exciting to me.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.496
She loved children.

04:55.976 --> 05:01.962
There was a little five-year-old who had come to do what they had to do from.

05:04.270 --> 05:32.623
She was also very good to see folks who were not a great name in African Americans, in fact, in general, in books.

05:32.603 --> 05:37.114
in the book press.

05:37.134 --> 05:48.400
But there was a lovely black girl who came and had skills and I think she couldn't do it personally.

05:48.421 --> 05:50.325
Laura couldn't have been what might have thought of her.

05:51.352 --> 06:18.001
There was also a gentleman, an old black man, who worked in a village, perhaps only John Murray would say.

06:18.021 --> 06:19.182
And one day he was waiting for a large plant in the Bible.

06:19.162 --> 06:28.763
Could he show her legal file?

06:28.783 --> 06:35.578
Well, there's even a file there in this ring that has to have a family that wants to get into the family and hold up.

06:35.878 --> 06:37.963
And should he leave?

06:39.023 --> 06:58.238
And she said, well, let's come in and talk about it.

06:58.258 --> 07:00.001
And he said, very dear to me, showed him a description, you know, who he, his wife was.

07:00.021 --> 07:01.624
He said, well, I think I can do something with this, but how much more it costs.

07:01.644 --> 07:02.365
And she said, I can't tell you that.

07:02.345 --> 07:21.969
And he said, well, it's going to be better, but come back this week, and I'll tell you what I can do.

07:21.989 --> 07:22.750
Well, it's a matter of, well, perhaps,

07:22.730 --> 07:44.929
maybe six or three hours, maybe six weeks, six or three hours a year.

07:44.949 --> 07:47.291
But she did mostly men and women, and hedges, and orders, and a little furnishings as well as a kind of heat filling.

07:47.311 --> 07:48.012
And they came in, and they came in.

07:48.032 --> 07:48.732
And they came in, and they came in.

07:48.752 --> 07:49.012
They came in.

07:49.032 --> 07:49.293
They came in.

07:49.313 --> 07:49.573
They came in.

07:49.593 --> 07:49.853
They came in.

07:49.873 --> 07:50.133
They came in.

07:50.153 --> 07:50.414
They came in.

07:50.434 --> 07:50.694
They came in.

07:50.714 --> 07:50.974
They came in.

07:50.994 --> 07:51.254
They came in.

07:51.274 --> 07:51.535
They came in.

07:51.555 --> 07:51.815
They came in.

07:51.835 --> 07:52.095
They came in.

07:52.649 --> 07:57.546
I'm afraid I have to know.

07:59.348 --> 08:24.276
That's part of the generative theory to that.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.959
And a real sort of tenderness, too, if you want to use a promotional word of that, toward a student in various states of disquietism.

08:26.939 --> 08:47.057
that I remember when her sister was grieving her at one time, a decade ago, and there was a serious crisis about her, many serious men, um, for the folks.

08:47.077 --> 08:47.698
I remember her couldn't to dig.

08:48.067 --> 09:03.936
She could do nothing else but rolling in on the phone.

09:03.956 --> 09:04.597
Distracted, totally preoccupied.

09:04.617 --> 09:04.978
And there she did.

09:06.629 --> 09:25.699
Well, I don't know because I'm so hard to pull over that I feel like it's fine.

09:25.719 --> 09:27.021
And this voice decided that I would cherish it as well as me.

09:27.042 --> 09:27.422
How do you do that?

09:27.442 --> 09:28.263
I'm just going to be capable of doing it.

09:28.283 --> 09:29.065
I mean, they never thought cared about.

09:29.085 --> 09:29.886
So, of course, about that for something.

09:38.118 --> 09:39.941
Hi, I'm John Reed.

09:39.961 --> 09:42.727
I'm the director of the library for the New York Botanical Garden.

09:42.747 --> 09:44.390
I'm one of those general librarians.

09:44.510 --> 09:47.055
I came to New York in 1965.

09:47.355 --> 09:51.703
I was booked at a science library in Michigan.

09:51.723 --> 10:01.662
What I knew about books repaired was mystic paint and creed, sewn linen and stitches that we stuck in the books and they held together a few years.

10:02.468 --> 10:09.435
And I inherited a very fine research library with a fine collection of pretty 17th-century books.

10:10.396 --> 10:16.182
And a lot of 18th, 19th-century books were used all the time.

10:17.743 --> 10:23.649
So after we moved the library to the new building, I had to start worrying about how I was going to take care of this.

10:23.669 --> 10:29.455
And somehow I became aware of this young, and she'd read a much bigger article surveyed where her book was.

10:29.755 --> 10:34.261
And that started about a 15-year relationship with the New York Botanical Gardens.

10:34.862 --> 10:37.966
She just surveyed her book collection.

10:37.986 --> 10:39.648
She then began working with my staff.

10:39.848 --> 10:50.161
They all came down to the studios, and they brought our books down, and this was all the top figures of our books.

10:50.882 --> 10:59.273
Amy Kyle, Amy Blatton, 2-3, Sugar Distility, and probably a couple other books I don't remember anymore.

11:00.502 --> 11:09.031
I basically got the lesson in sharing reading from the book collection in a proper way.

11:09.051 --> 11:11.434
And that I think is what I mean when you said.

11:11.454 --> 11:25.330
And for her, she moves on to the art to a conservation program, and the people who work at that place.

11:25.350 --> 11:28.213
And it's something that we all cherish what you're thinking.

11:28.233 --> 11:28.433
Thank you.

11:28.868 --> 11:35.047
My name is Margaret Johnson, and I came to Laura Young in the late 70s.

11:36.130 --> 11:40.363
I've been working at public catalog for a year ago.

11:41.086 --> 11:47.053
the Pennsylvania Hospital Historic Library in Philadelphia.

11:47.073 --> 11:55.422
And every time we picked up a book so far, so I began to wonder how many books we could get together again.

11:55.562 --> 11:59.006
And when I found this again, I realized this is exactly what I want.

11:59.026 --> 12:01.709
I did not know a very fine body.

12:01.729 --> 12:04.472
I was already too old to go into that.

12:04.492 --> 12:06.334
I didn't have my eyesight by the time I started.

12:06.601 --> 12:17.716
So I came up every two weeks for two days and spent with her taking home, taking books and co-books and things like that.

12:17.996 --> 12:26.027
And what she started you out with was how to do what her basic line is.

12:26.902 --> 12:56.841
to begin with and then we started taking books apart and putting them back together again which is what i still do and i think the most valuable thing she did was to show me how to retrieve my errors because i always made a mistake and she said you always will make some mistakes so i'm it was almost the second day i made the error before i went home because i was

12:56.821 --> 13:03.410
and from their activities later, and she'd say, well, I was thinking about that in the middle of the night.

13:03.431 --> 13:05.333
I think that what do you do with that one?

13:05.754 --> 13:07.917
She never forgot what you were working on.

13:09.399 --> 13:16.990
And the other recollection of her was in 1980, the ARC had their meeting at the Kansas City Council.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.973
She's never been to San Francisco.

13:19.534 --> 13:27.588
She had, however, been in communication with a lot of members to deal with here in California.

13:27.848 --> 13:38.185
Stella Tutte, who is in San Francisco, who was one of the federal members of the hand, the pleasure in California, and Margaret Wefty, who was there in Los Angeles.

13:38.924 --> 13:45.153
who is taught a lot of the language.

13:45.173 --> 13:51.882
And she was one of the founders of WACC, which I think is the Western Association for Conservation of Arts.

13:53.484 --> 13:58.251
And she had talked to them on the telephone.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.593
She had written extensively.

13:59.613 --> 14:01.776
And she knew these women, but she had never met them.

14:01.756 --> 14:08.188
And it was at that meeting, at the dinner, that the three ladies met.

14:08.628 --> 14:16.843
And all three of them were strong influences in both learning and conservation in America.

14:16.983 --> 14:24.918
And it was funny to see that.

14:24.938 --> 14:25.940
And I enjoyed all the different I think with it.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.160
Thank you.

14:26.933 --> 14:39.288
I'm Haley Kyle, and I respond to staff members that John Lee mentioned that he sent to Mrs. Young to learn the art and craft of finding and conservation.

14:39.328 --> 14:41.451
And I entered my craft in the early 70s.

14:42.612 --> 14:47.739
And she became one of the most important teachers of my life, and she became my mentor.

14:47.959 --> 14:54.527
And I was at the time, and it was a year change, and I needed somebody like her that gave me the direction.

14:55.013 --> 15:12.455
One of the best things that I remember about her was if you showed her work and she wasn't quite, and she would just look at it and she would say, are you satisfied with this?

15:12.555 --> 15:20.785
And she would look at it and then you would just have to be honest with yourself and say,

15:21.187 --> 15:21.888
Not really.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.132
And then she said, all right, I didn't know what to do.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.454
And you knew that, you know, things, and you did it over.

15:28.015 --> 15:30.358
And I did many things over and over again.

15:31.679 --> 15:40.950
And one of the other things that I haven't learned quite yet, but that is constantly in my memory, there are two things that she really could not tell me.

15:41.091 --> 15:43.954
And they were, it and great.

15:44.609 --> 15:50.077
She had an incredible patience for everything, and she would never understand.

15:50.097 --> 15:52.161
She would take everything.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.703
She would unlock things.

15:53.723 --> 16:05.341
She would make the package paper out of paper bags.

16:06.302 --> 16:13.333
She would have her ways of being using materials, and it didn't matter how long you smoke.

16:13.482 --> 16:16.607
Just that Sora wouldn't make me wait there.

16:16.627 --> 16:19.111
The other thing, she was incredibly resourceful.

16:19.291 --> 16:32.211
She had her shop back the office that she had every time that she could ever leave and use for binding, as all the work you do.

16:32.231 --> 16:41.025
But in the later years, when she retired and moved to the Virginia, or the Eastern Shore in Virginia,

16:41.292 --> 16:52.131
I was happy and lucky to visit my public mind with some of the other other students.

16:52.151 --> 16:59.563
And it was actually the first time that we were her guests in her house, in her home, because before she had always received that in her shop.

16:59.584 --> 17:04.532
And I don't think many of us had ever visited each other because of the public.

17:04.968 --> 17:14.809
So we finally saw it in a common home, and we saw it in a mental home in only Virginia, and told us that there was comfort, beautiful places where

17:15.616 --> 17:24.449
And she had her way just like she always had her mind.

17:24.549 --> 17:31.940
And to end this, I just want you to recall one memory that I have.

17:32.080 --> 17:36.987
She was in the fall and she was driving about cars going over the driveway.

17:37.988 --> 17:43.176
And the whole driveway was spread with black walnuts and then sick.

17:43.156 --> 17:56.845
on a shelf and this is how it is to get the parts of the shelf.

18:06.258 --> 18:12.433
I would line down with Mr. Jones for two minutes.

18:12.453 --> 18:13.175
I never mess with Jerry.

18:13.195 --> 18:23.018
I'm excited for her, but I think I can safely say I'm the only one of Mr. Jones's students who paid for lessons by working with the Go-Go-Bets or the Mafia.

18:22.998 --> 18:29.868
The show found us amusing and considered resourcefulness an excellent characteristic of the book finder.

18:29.888 --> 18:40.383
I attended Mrs. Shun's studio regularly, put together a roster of my own clients, and eventually went off to Yale to study with James Greenfield as a conservation of my repertoire.

18:40.443 --> 18:52.701
Although I've always kept my interest in vibing and restoring, as well as my vibing put me close to hand, I've also published art exhibition posters and had a five and decorative art gallery which featured, among other things,

18:52.681 --> 18:58.352
Splendid books by artists, the occasional manuscript, fine findings, and type of fresh painting.

18:58.993 --> 19:04.002
Presently, I design them the expensive hats for fashion people.

19:04.023 --> 19:07.990
It's unfortunate that people are willing to spend money on granted than finding books.

19:08.223 --> 19:12.329
I do think, however, that Mrs. Jeon would not be too unhappy about the hat.

19:12.970 --> 19:22.165
She confessed to me that one of her great heroes was Wallace Simpson, which leads me to believe she felt the tiniest bit of moral activity could be offset by a certain amount of style.

19:26.151 --> 19:34.264
I do feel that even at the conference so far could not have been managed without my training at Mrs. Jeon's capable and talented hand.

19:34.244 --> 19:46.696
I've been lucky enough to have seen an excellent education, but until I started studying with this as a junior, no one taught me to really analyze the task, breaking down the need of its component, and organizing it into a logical order.

19:48.138 --> 19:52.061
I believe that intelligence and talent are fairly useless without discipline.

19:52.081 --> 20:00.029
I was also taught that each material has its own character, and that the discovery of this nature was the key to a successful deployment.

20:00.049 --> 20:02.952
The very best part about when we're done whatever

20:03.202 --> 20:08.591
was that she made me respond to your notes in my phone.

20:08.611 --> 20:13.659
She was interested in everything, and rather, of course, without constant pain.

20:13.679 --> 20:18.667
The parameters of Mr. Shona's curiosity became clear to me one day as I was concentrating on my bench.

20:19.468 --> 20:23.995
Mr. Shona's chin started on my shoulder, and she said,

20:24.802 --> 20:34.374
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:34.395 --> 20:36.597
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:36.617 --> 20:37.979
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:37.999 --> 20:39.541
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:39.561 --> 20:40.743
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:40.763 --> 20:42.285
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:42.385 --> 20:44.768
Mr. Kirk, why not have a transvestite kept such big shoes?

20:44.748 --> 20:46.971
She's not going to be walking walking away.

20:47.752 --> 20:53.341
If she'd leave her now, I could tell her with certainty where to invest at in such big town.

20:53.361 --> 20:58.709
While I was from Yale, I asked Jane Greenfield why she became the whole person.

20:58.729 --> 20:59.690
I'm not sure why.

20:59.710 --> 21:04.437
Because I didn't want to be a major who probably could repeat it that way.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.239
And I think that Ms.

21:05.259 --> 21:07.482
General would agree with that whole part of it.

21:07.462 --> 21:10.988
Mori Young was a professional in the best possible way.

21:11.008 --> 21:19.403
She was competent without being rigid, competent but non-mechanical, and precise without using the livelihood that transforms craft into art.

21:20.324 --> 21:22.568
And she was patient with the art

21:33.247 --> 21:39.777
Hello, I'm Mr. Rudy.

21:40.598 --> 21:43.723
I'm still to the council.

21:43.743 --> 21:45.225
I'm not going to tell you there, and you're going to need a bill.

21:45.245 --> 21:46.227
I think that you're going to need a bill.

21:46.247 --> 21:47.589
I think that you're going to need a bill.

21:47.609 --> 21:49.451
I think you're going to need a bill.

21:49.472 --> 21:50.373
I think you're going to need a bill.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.795
I think you're going to need a bill.

21:51.775 --> 22:03.577
Of all of my new members, in my years of studies and beyond, one decision was later in the bond.

22:03.597 --> 22:06.763
It had to do with the time I would look at the bond that I just completed.

22:06.903 --> 22:10.830
On those occasions, when I knew that the order of working chair was not quite that effective,

22:10.810 --> 22:30.271
I was pretty high here for myself, and it really brought back to me.

22:30.291 --> 22:32.894
I would take the boat from Mr. Young, only three years to save, and very quietly, let all, do and read.

22:32.914 --> 22:34.816
I don't think she would ever complete the session, but I always knew that the ending was there.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.057
Take it back, and it wasn't.

22:36.077 --> 22:37.999
In the first place, I always did take it back to me, correct the undefensible words.

22:37.979 --> 22:56.819
For 20 years or so, since I do spend everything to come, it's still a regular long trip to fall under my workmanship.

22:56.839 --> 23:00.303
The reality I find things that really do need to be done.

23:00.323 --> 23:01.284
I'm surprised to convince myself that it's okay.

23:01.304 --> 23:03.927
I want to hear that quiet voice that's all my retirement and perhaps inside of me.

23:03.947 --> 23:04.828
It's a voice of reality and self-discipline.

23:04.848 --> 23:06.990
My hope and trust are always following me.

23:06.970 --> 23:18.921
Wow.

23:21.365 --> 23:45.834
And now we've all worked for that, and we have a show of men of students, of students of Michigan.

23:45.854 --> 23:49.858
And I knew this has been a very broad way to meet people who are actually students, people who have taken workshops with their students, for those of you who have been interested in or worked with us.

23:49.878 --> 23:50.079
Thank you.

23:50.099 --> 23:50.299
Thank you.

23:50.319 --> 23:50.519
Thank you.

23:50.539 --> 23:50.739
Thank you.

23:50.759 --> 23:50.960
Thank you.

23:50.980 --> 23:51.220
That's nice.

24:01.780 --> 24:05.566
Well, I think you can tell me still too much.

24:05.666 --> 24:17.284
I'd like to thank the Friends of Laura Young, the Brolier Club, and the New York Chapter of Gilded Book Workers for making the evening possible, and special thanks to the committee who organized it.

24:17.304 --> 24:22.793
There was co-chaired by Sally Morgan and Maggie Ross who was members.

24:24.140 --> 24:48.277
Oh, the name of the committee is the Bourbon and Bone Bowl Committee.

24:48.297 --> 24:50.280
This was really very good, wasn't it?

24:50.300 --> 24:50.400
Yeah.
