00:03.895 --> 00:17.493
I mean, the responsibility of the auction house is to take every precaution to assure yourself and the buying public that the thing is legitimately acquired, shall we say.

00:17.513 --> 00:24.121
And of course, you take somebody in, somebody comes in and you take them at their word that the thing is found in a flea market.

00:24.141 --> 00:26.645
The frame doesn't exist, the picture doesn't exist.

00:26.665 --> 00:28.087
Skepticism naturally.

00:29.549 --> 00:32.232
Do you ever wonder, did you wonder in this case,

00:32.397 --> 00:33.619
about the provenance at all?

00:34.841 --> 00:38.626
That's outside of your realm of interest?

00:38.686 --> 00:41.991
No, it's certainly not outside the realm of interest.

00:43.032 --> 01:00.037
But in this case, the fact that it was real was so manifestly true that the question of whether it was in a picture frame or behind a wall or in a drawer or whatever, one couldn't determine.

01:00.097 --> 01:01.459
But the fact that it was real

01:02.857 --> 01:18.136
was absolutely apparent, and I mean, it so happens that the Declaration is a piece of printing that's been... Well, sentences have been made with greatest care, and so it takes about 30 seconds.

01:18.636 --> 01:24.644
Well, I mean, it takes a couple of minutes to determine that it couldn't possibly have been any of the recorded copies.

01:24.664 --> 01:27.067
I mean, those are the two questions.

01:27.087 --> 01:27.627
Is it real?

01:27.807 --> 01:30.771
And if it's real, could it be a copy which is only recorded?

01:31.122 --> 01:33.545
which therefore should be in somebody else's ownership.

01:34.626 --> 01:42.854
Once you've established that it's real and it's not one of the recorded copies, then that's really all you need.

01:43.075 --> 01:54.767
I mean, is it possible that, you know, one thing that I've certainly been to any number of institutions since I started my project, and even at Texas, where they have material that they've had for 20 years that's still not catalogued.

01:55.388 --> 02:10.789
I'm not even asking you to speculate, but I think the talk of the street out here, having been to a number of these options, and I've been in these institutions, you know, it's possible that you might have an uncatalogued box lot or something.

02:12.091 --> 02:23.286
Did that ever... Well, I mean, the other factor one can't say much about, but the owner of the Declaration...

02:24.363 --> 02:46.776
was himself so truly surprised by what it was that it didn't occur to any of the people who dealt with it personally that that somehow he was something something that there was something wrong i guess what david said is that you can do what the most an auction house can do is

02:47.853 --> 02:49.981
You know, I mean, give it a good faith shot.

02:50.743 --> 02:51.546
I suppose that's true.

02:51.606 --> 02:59.635
I mean, there comes a point where you have to take somebody at their word unless there's no contradictory evidence to suggest that it's...

03:00.138 --> 03:02.802
It was a fascinating story, though.

03:02.942 --> 03:05.786
Oh, it led to hundreds of phone calls for us.

03:05.806 --> 03:13.497
I suppose they wasted our time, because most of them... Very few stories were a great interest in that one.

03:13.517 --> 03:19.585
I mean, there was a problem with the Columbus letter, but that was another thing, I guess.

03:21.187 --> 03:22.309
A little bit of coffee?

03:22.549 --> 03:25.133
Yeah, I'd like coffee myself as well.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.322
I'm going to have a double espresso, please.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.223
I guess the same for me.

03:29.263 --> 03:30.945
I guess I can handle that.

03:30.965 --> 03:32.827
Good black coffee, American coffee, I guess.

03:34.489 --> 03:39.495
Do you have a sense of, again, what something is worth?

03:39.555 --> 03:45.401
Like, what if the Bay Sam book were to come on the market today?

03:45.421 --> 03:48.004
Well, the Bay Sam book... I don't know offhand.

03:48.064 --> 03:50.867
I mean, clearly it would be something...

03:51.522 --> 03:56.366
of major value, which for books would mean into seven figures rather than just six figures.

03:57.227 --> 04:03.013
But more than that, I don't know what one would say.

04:03.033 --> 04:11.761
I mean, in a way, you might say, well, at one time, the Bay Psalm book held the auction record for a printed book, so you would think that it's comparable to the Gutenberg Bible.

04:11.781 --> 04:14.103
I mean, you try to make a reasoned judgment.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.866
Well, there were 11 Bay Psalm books, and there were, what, 42 Gutenberg Bible books?

04:17.886 --> 04:19.588
Forty-odd, I mean, varying.

04:19.973 --> 04:21.795
You did a census of them.

04:21.915 --> 04:24.818
I think they called them the Doheny.

04:24.838 --> 04:25.619
Yeah, that's right.

04:25.639 --> 04:26.400
I'm going to do it.

04:26.420 --> 04:31.486
In fact, one of the two or three remaining interviews that I'm going to do, I have to do, I think, is with Owen Gingrich at Harvard.

04:32.847 --> 04:33.328
He's obsessed with this.

04:33.348 --> 04:35.650
Yeah, he would be very interesting to talk to.

04:35.670 --> 04:41.957
And I don't know that the Cambridge University Press is publishing his book, The Copernicus Chase, and it's due presently.

04:42.818 --> 04:44.941
Tell me a little bit about the importance of a census.

04:45.141 --> 04:48.985
I mean, is what Owen is doing without knowing too much about it an important thing?

04:49.471 --> 04:53.335
to find out where every copy of a book is possible.

04:53.355 --> 05:01.802
I think it's an interesting process with any book which is definably of major importance and influence.

05:04.104 --> 05:16.296
The question of how it got that way always is important, and it's just one channel of investigation, but it certainly is an interesting one.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.757
I mean, for the Copernicus,

05:18.293 --> 05:37.585
that question is what sort of annotations do the copies have and what sort of ownership to show that they were in the hands of other people thinking about cosmology essentially uh for the gutenberg bible there's still a lot a lot has been done but even more could be done on how the book

05:38.341 --> 05:45.711
was used as a reading copy in monasteries.

05:46.112 --> 05:59.991
Different books will have different points of interest, but I think for anything, or the Shakespeare folios, if one is able to look at essentially all surviving copies, certainly something interesting will come out.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.193
How do you feel about

06:01.966 --> 06:10.554
Of course, with the folio, it's been demonstrated that having more than one copy of the folio, certainly, because there's a worthwhile thing to do.

06:10.574 --> 06:16.899
But generally speaking, a lot of people consider, you know, more than one duplication, more than one copy, gluttony.

06:19.302 --> 06:28.470
I mean, there's a case Roger mentioned to me where Harvard had a second beautiful copy of Silek Citillians, which they sold to Tom Taylor, I guess.

06:28.790 --> 06:31.973
Are you familiar with that case?

06:32.645 --> 06:33.906
Who sold it to him?

06:33.926 --> 06:36.529
I mean, the predecessor, the big name, Jackson.

06:36.909 --> 06:39.711
He would have sold it to Tom Taylor.

06:39.972 --> 06:40.832
I think he did.

06:40.852 --> 06:44.316
No, because Tom Taylor wasn't around in Bill Jackson's.

06:44.536 --> 06:46.257
So it would have been some other book dealer.

06:46.798 --> 06:47.238
Not a dealer.

06:47.258 --> 06:48.920
He sold it to a collector.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.181
Oh, a collector.

06:50.201 --> 06:50.541
Tom.

06:51.302 --> 06:51.943
Oh.

06:52.063 --> 06:56.487
Whose great collection went to Princeton in much the same way that Shitey's might?

06:56.787 --> 06:57.628
Robert Taylor.

06:57.688 --> 06:58.649
Bob Taylor.

06:58.689 --> 06:58.989
Yes.

06:59.229 --> 07:00.030
That's right.

07:00.590 --> 07:01.251
That's right.

07:01.349 --> 07:09.266
That's a case where it goes counter to the institutionalization thing.

07:09.387 --> 07:18.126
It was where an institution had something that was marvelous and rare and apparently pristine, but they had two and they said a collector will take better care of it

07:18.865 --> 07:21.970
And this was his reasoning, because it was a perfect copy.

07:22.110 --> 07:24.734
I think maybe he was angry, but you get a collection for Harvard, too.

07:24.754 --> 07:28.540
You never know in the wrong way.

07:28.600 --> 07:43.704
And as Roger says, and you must know this on the institutional level, that we are actually reaching the point where we might even have to portion out windows of access to some of these things, because it's like a watercolor.

07:45.306 --> 07:47.269
Yeah, that's true.

07:48.295 --> 07:54.061
Do you have a feeling on that at all?

07:54.942 --> 07:55.963
Well, I think it's true.

07:56.123 --> 08:14.303
In a way, I can speak about that more from the library side, because for an auction house, one is happy to sell important objects and isn't going to do a great deal of

08:15.329 --> 08:18.453
counter-thinking, saying, no, you shouldn't sell something important.

08:18.473 --> 08:21.417
They think that libraries and collectors make those decisions.

08:21.497 --> 08:29.888
But it's true when one sells a duplicate, there always are points of difference between what one keeps and gives up.

08:30.228 --> 08:31.570
And so there's a loss there.

08:32.291 --> 08:38.098
But that has to be balanced against what you gain by disposing of the duplicate.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.224
So I think one can still make a measurement.

08:42.244 --> 08:44.847
If you acquire something else important as a result,

08:46.396 --> 08:47.057
Well, fine.

08:47.097 --> 09:01.389
I don't think one should pretend that a duplicate is simply a disposable object, because it takes a lot of study to determine what one would be losing by giving it up.

09:02.330 --> 09:12.459
But I don't think it's a sacred duty never to dispose of a duplicate.

09:12.479 --> 09:14.901
But you do think, to jump back and say,

09:16.096 --> 09:23.983
But it's a perfectly valid scholarly pursuit, for them to have 79-plus perspectives.

09:24.003 --> 09:27.566
You don't think it's hoarding in any way.

09:27.787 --> 09:29.328
Oh, no, not at all.

09:29.348 --> 09:31.590
No, that was very enterprising, that Folger.

09:31.770 --> 09:35.754
I mean, it turned out to be very enterprising.

09:35.774 --> 09:38.817
I mean, you think he foresaw the Hinman collation?

09:38.857 --> 09:39.998
No, I don't think he did.

09:40.018 --> 09:44.922
I mean, I think it probably was more just an instinct that this is not...

09:46.252 --> 09:52.621
that this is rather a wise thing to be doing, to be buying lots and lots of multiple copies.

09:54.143 --> 09:56.206
Boy, it was something to see, though, I have to say.

09:56.346 --> 09:56.606
Yeah.

09:56.626 --> 10:00.592
This is somebody in there lying flat.

10:00.612 --> 10:01.753
That was something new to me.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.776
I've been pretty good.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.318
I really apologize.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.261
I've been pretty good.

10:07.281 --> 10:11.807
I haven't done anything to come up until that point.

10:11.827 --> 10:12.829
I apologize.

10:12.909 --> 10:15.212
I'm sorry.

10:17.572 --> 10:36.275
What if a person buys something in good faith, and I think that this individual bought this in good faith, that turns out to be stolen?

10:36.616 --> 10:39.579
Not from the individual that he bought it from, certainly not by him.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.041
He bought it in good faith.

10:41.061 --> 10:42.523
Who owns that item?

10:43.104 --> 10:43.444
Who?

10:43.897 --> 10:46.420
the original true owner owns it.

10:46.441 --> 10:46.721
Really?

10:46.821 --> 10:47.682
That doesn't change.

10:47.963 --> 10:52.549
Even if this person paid a million dollars for it, let's say, seven figures.

10:52.569 --> 10:56.955
In this country, it's not a matter of... Yeah, that simply is the law.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.660
In Switzerland, the law is slightly different.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.523
So that's just a question of law.

11:03.123 --> 11:07.269
No, I wouldn't say... Well, did you have any opinions of him?

11:07.289 --> 11:09.973
Looks like he's a pretty ornery character.

11:09.993 --> 11:11.175
I didn't like him very well.

11:11.735 --> 11:12.216
He's a...

11:13.124 --> 11:14.345
He's one of my subjects.

11:14.846 --> 11:17.228
He's kind of Paul Staff of the Texas chapter.

11:17.489 --> 11:19.110
He plans to take over the whole thing.

11:20.412 --> 11:24.336
He was basically the architect of the collection at the University of Texas.

11:24.376 --> 11:27.700
He was the exclusive agent.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.465
People would have good stuff, and they wouldn't buy it unless it went through Feldman.

11:34.186 --> 11:35.668
It's strange how that came to pass.

11:36.949 --> 11:40.313
Do you remember any dealings with Charles Hamilton here in New York?

11:40.529 --> 11:42.231
I mean, I know who he is.

11:42.451 --> 11:42.972
Erika.

11:42.992 --> 11:43.232
Yeah.

11:45.555 --> 11:46.457
What else can I ask?

11:46.497 --> 11:50.522
Do you have any nominations for it?

11:50.542 --> 11:53.245
Who do you think might be the great living collectors?

11:55.768 --> 12:04.500
I think in this country, Bill Scheide would be definitely the... And I would quote you on this, because I do have a chapter just on him.

12:04.520 --> 12:10.367
What makes him a great collector?

12:11.900 --> 12:20.667
Well, he's continued to be serious about his collection for so long, and it's continued as a family tradition for three generations now.

12:20.908 --> 12:25.631
That's a very unusual situation.

12:25.652 --> 12:37.782
And with this acquisition of the 36-line Bible, that is kind of a culmination of something that goes back a hundred years or more within that family.

12:37.842 --> 12:41.805
I think it's essentially a unique situation.

12:42.730 --> 12:50.439
I think he actually has acquired on his own six or seven Gutenberg-related items.

12:50.619 --> 12:56.846
Gutenberg-related items, all of very great importance, very great interest.

12:56.966 --> 12:59.489
I saw his Blickling homilies.

13:00.790 --> 13:07.397
I remember talking to Nicholas Barker in England and how he felt about that being over here.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.700
He said, that is a national disgrace.

13:10.270 --> 13:12.112
Oh, come on now.

13:12.132 --> 13:15.276
Well, that's... No, we're talking about... I don't want to make that as a quote.

13:15.837 --> 13:24.247
We're talking about the investment for an item actually does contribute to its... Oh, yeah.

13:24.407 --> 13:26.510
I mean, it certainly increases the likelihood.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.192
There are no absolute guarantees.

13:28.673 --> 13:31.576
It increases the likelihood of its safe survival.

13:31.596 --> 13:35.121
I'm going to ask you to inscribe this for me.

13:35.141 --> 13:36.022
Oh, thank you.

13:36.663 --> 13:37.864
I have a collection of...

13:38.603 --> 13:41.387
items that is developed.

13:41.407 --> 13:42.569
Did you see the oath of a free man?

13:43.150 --> 13:51.203
Oh yeah, I've seen the oath of a free man, but unofficially and never having to give an opinion.

13:51.223 --> 13:54.448
I mean, I must say it looked pretty good to me.

13:55.910 --> 14:02.761
I thought the great question with that was its provenance or lack of provenance.

14:03.142 --> 14:06.467
But apart from that, as an object, it's

14:07.308 --> 14:11.234
I suppose one has to accept that it's a forgery, but it's a good one.

14:11.294 --> 14:16.742
The only reason Marcus didn't buy it for AAS wasn't that he questioned it, it was the price.

14:17.883 --> 14:25.034
They wanted a million and a half and the AAS was willing to pay 250, which for them would have been a real struggle.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.958
Yeah, but they were willing to do it.

14:27.978 --> 14:30.902
So a lot of people were, I mean Michael, you know Michael Lehman,
