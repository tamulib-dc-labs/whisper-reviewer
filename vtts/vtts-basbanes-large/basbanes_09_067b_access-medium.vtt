WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:07.144
put the thing on anyway.

00:07.784 --> 00:10.287
We talked about Vietnam, but it's important.

00:10.327 --> 00:12.170
Tell me about winning the National Book Award.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.552
Oh, it's nothing.

00:14.632 --> 00:18.697
It helps in terms of luck.

00:19.598 --> 00:24.764
Who reads it, who the judges are, whether they happen to read your book or not, whether they're in a good mood that day.

00:25.465 --> 00:29.650
In my case, Wallace Stegner's wife, as I was told, read the book.

00:30.136 --> 00:32.260
and said, I like this book, you should read it.

00:32.761 --> 00:33.282
She hasn't read it.

00:34.104 --> 00:36.268
Maybe he wouldn't have.

00:37.210 --> 00:41.217
And, you know, I mean, it's just a lot.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.383
Well, I made a point of him.

00:44.423 --> 00:45.946
He's a friend of mine.

00:45.966 --> 00:49.393
Parts of Garf are unbelievably beautiful.

00:50.099 --> 00:52.722
It's weird what happened to John.

00:52.782 --> 00:56.866
He was known as a literary writer, Garfield, and suddenly he's a commercial writer.

00:57.006 --> 00:58.948
I'm interviewing him in New York.

00:58.968 --> 01:00.290
Tell him hi, number one.

01:01.211 --> 01:02.412
But I made a point in my speech.

01:02.472 --> 01:07.397
I asked a question to Carnegie Hall.

01:07.477 --> 01:12.743
I said, on the strength of your speech, it sounds like you felt the wrong person you want.

01:12.763 --> 01:13.504
I remember the question.

01:13.524 --> 01:14.925
I remember you.

01:15.260 --> 01:15.981
I don't feel that.

01:16.021 --> 01:19.748
I feel I deserve to win, but I feel he deserved to win.

01:19.768 --> 01:20.950
We both deserve to win.

01:21.932 --> 01:24.356
But I felt, I mean, my response was on it.

01:24.476 --> 01:24.737
Yeah.

01:24.957 --> 01:26.880
And I do.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.144
I mean, I love that book.

01:29.164 --> 01:31.508
The Ponfion grill parts are sections of that book.

01:31.529 --> 01:33.512
They're so magical and beautiful.

01:34.193 --> 01:39.242
There's a magic in the book that's overlooked now because it was a bestseller.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.699
It's weird.

01:41.939 --> 01:44.823
The women's movement was very aggressive then.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.564
They didn't like the Ellen Jamesians.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.166
Yeah, the Ellen Jamesian thing, yeah.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.690
Cutting out the tons, very resettles on their board.

01:52.170 --> 01:55.594
And I think there was no way.

01:55.714 --> 02:00.379
There were two women on their board.

02:00.539 --> 02:03.722
I thought Cheever was actually going to win that.

02:03.762 --> 02:07.366
Yeah, but that was also the material that was published.

02:07.386 --> 02:09.128
I mean, there were a lot of us who knew it.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.392
Yeah.

02:11.412 --> 02:12.433
I wouldn't have felt bad, though.

02:12.494 --> 02:14.095
I mean, what you feel is luck.

02:14.456 --> 02:17.419
I mean, I felt blessed and fortunate and always will.

02:18.421 --> 02:25.088
But at the same time, I also know that The Things They Carried was a better book.

02:25.108 --> 02:28.332
And it was a finalist for everything.

02:30.175 --> 02:37.343
But I also knew that Rabbit at Rest was a great book, and I didn't feel anyâ€”I felt proud that Uptight won.

02:37.930 --> 02:47.503
I was disappointed in a way, but I also knew that a good book would want, a bad book would want, I'd have been pissed.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.625
Did you read that Paco story?

02:49.665 --> 02:49.906
Yeah.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.389
What did you think of that?

02:52.529 --> 02:52.790
So-so.

02:52.810 --> 02:52.950
So-so.

02:53.370 --> 02:54.231
I mean, I didn't hate it.

02:54.632 --> 03:00.600
I liked his first book a lot better called Close Quarters, which is, that's a hell of a book.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.787
I mean, that's the one that caused a big controversy.

03:05.947 --> 03:06.047
Yeah.

03:06.466 --> 03:10.271
It's all luck.

03:10.631 --> 03:12.233
People don't realize that.

03:12.313 --> 03:19.662
When you think about it, what if William Gass had been a judge?

03:19.962 --> 03:23.046
His work and my work, there's no way he's going to like my work.

03:23.066 --> 03:27.712
There's no way I'm going to admire his work, but I can't fall in love with it.

03:29.013 --> 03:34.600
That fiction is touching and squeezing the human heart.

03:35.643 --> 03:37.906
And he doesn't care much about squeezing the heart.

03:38.607 --> 03:44.053
He cares that his concerns are intellectual and a minor, too, in part.

03:44.073 --> 03:58.491
But for me, if a book doesn't somehow grab your heart and scare you a little bit or give you the chills or make you a little sad or make you want to wake up in the night and say, my God, I don't know.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.254
That's what Billy Budd does for me.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.878
And that's what art does.
