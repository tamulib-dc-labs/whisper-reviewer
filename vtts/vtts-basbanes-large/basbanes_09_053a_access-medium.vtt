WEBVTT

00:05.026 --> 00:06.789
OK.

00:06.809 --> 00:08.231
Alison Lurie, number one.

00:09.012 --> 00:12.097
Let's start with the wonderful title, The Last Resort.

00:12.118 --> 00:15.403
It seems to have a number of textures.

00:15.663 --> 00:18.007
I try to have titles like that.

00:18.668 --> 00:21.633
I look for them, and sometimes I find them.

00:22.975 --> 00:26.341
And did you title the book after you'd written it?

00:26.581 --> 00:26.861
Oh, yes.

00:27.603 --> 00:28.965
Does that always happen with you?

00:29.586 --> 00:32.130
Mostly it does, yes.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.284
Boyd could almost even go to another level.

00:36.324 --> 00:42.693
Do you feel that... You're ten years between novels, I guess.

00:42.973 --> 00:50.383
Everyone says that, but they forget that there was a book of short stories between... In 95, I think it was.

00:51.164 --> 00:53.467
Is this the last resort novel for you, I guess, as well?

00:53.487 --> 00:54.669
Well, I can't tell, of course.

00:55.049 --> 00:57.072
How can you know?

00:58.385 --> 01:01.268
Why do you think it was 10 years between humbles?

01:01.288 --> 01:04.951
I think I became interested in other projects.

01:04.971 --> 01:06.592
I wrote articles.

01:07.393 --> 01:10.956
I took jobs teaching.

01:11.537 --> 01:13.558
And this book took me quite a while.

01:15.380 --> 01:18.483
Can you talk a little bit about the premise?

01:19.283 --> 01:23.187
I did a search, and there were some wonderful interviews with you, by the way, in the British press.

01:23.327 --> 01:23.967
That's true.

01:24.007 --> 01:26.890
There were some nice people there.

01:27.224 --> 01:29.126
I found them last night at LexisNexis.

01:29.327 --> 01:30.428
You can find those things.

01:31.289 --> 01:31.970
I didn't know that.

01:32.711 --> 01:34.473
I have all of them today.

01:34.493 --> 01:35.294
Have you seen them yet?

01:35.354 --> 01:37.357
Most of them I probably have.

01:37.377 --> 01:39.399
If I have copies, I'd be happy to send them to you.

01:39.419 --> 01:40.060
No, no.

01:40.421 --> 01:44.466
If I haven't seen any of them, they'll come in the mail from my English publisher.

01:44.846 --> 01:47.229
There's a service that I buy.

01:47.249 --> 01:48.431
It's called LexisNexis.

01:48.731 --> 01:50.093
Oh, yes.

01:50.377 --> 01:53.446
And it searches just about every... This is good.

01:53.526 --> 01:55.752
So you don't have to search yourself.

01:55.832 --> 01:57.818
It just takes, does it and brings it to you.

01:58.139 --> 01:59.443
Well, I punch you in Alice and Laurie.

01:59.864 --> 02:00.285
I see.

02:00.451 --> 02:03.495
And I say English magazines, English newspapers.

02:03.575 --> 02:06.319
I can focus to the New York Times or the Washington Post or the L.A.

02:06.339 --> 02:06.519
Times.

02:06.539 --> 02:06.679
I see.

02:06.699 --> 02:07.540
That's good.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.782
I can specify the years.

02:09.042 --> 02:12.467
I went back on you to 1980, for instance.

02:12.487 --> 02:15.631
Found some very interesting interviews you did with the Washington Post.

02:15.651 --> 02:17.693
Which I've probably completely forgotten.

02:17.713 --> 02:18.174
Yeah.

02:18.194 --> 02:23.861
It's interesting to see how the interviews... You haven't changed that much, I have to say, over the years.

02:23.901 --> 02:29.108
I find the consistency, which is really... I guess not.

02:29.442 --> 02:38.091
In one of those interviews with the British press, you were reminded of a quote, and you said, I hope I didn't say that, but I probably did.

02:38.351 --> 02:40.293
Yeah, yeah.

02:40.793 --> 02:41.894
I brought up the British press.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.177
You're an enormously popular writer.

02:44.557 --> 02:44.857
I am.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.099
I'm more popular there than I am here.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.504
And do you have an exploration for that, or why do you suppose that is?

02:51.524 --> 02:58.791
I think it's because I was brought up on British fiction, and when I was in college,

02:59.395 --> 03:01.598
I read British fiction.

03:01.658 --> 03:03.982
I was a history and literature major.

03:04.703 --> 03:12.715
And at that point, you didn't study many American women writers.

03:13.276 --> 03:19.486
The only American woman writer that was in the canon was Emily Dickinson.

03:20.407 --> 03:27.057
And therefore, but lots of British women writers were read.

03:27.526 --> 03:37.697
And I read them, and I think that my style and my tone were maybe formed through my reading because this was my focus.

03:38.178 --> 03:49.810
So I think that what's happened, and I know I've said this before, is that I write about somewhat exotic subjects in a British style.

03:50.451 --> 03:54.175
That is not very exotic, but American subjects.

03:54.661 --> 04:04.612
And this makes me popular there because my manner is familiar and my material is new.

04:05.412 --> 04:12.240
But here I'm writing about more familiar material in a manner that's unfamiliar.

04:12.320 --> 04:19.427
So I think it's harder for American readers to get into cahoots with what I'm doing.

04:20.008 --> 04:22.070
That's my explanation.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.672
But you definitely consider yourself

04:23.956 --> 04:26.940
An American writer writing in American traditions?

04:27.301 --> 04:28.222
Oh, well, sure.

04:28.523 --> 04:36.033
I have to be an American writer because I'm an American and I'm not an expatriate.

04:36.073 --> 04:41.281
This is where I live and where my connections are.

04:41.501 --> 04:45.086
But you also feel that you emerge from American traditions, literary traditions.

04:45.106 --> 04:53.338
Well, only peripherally because the American tradition in fiction is of men struggling with

04:53.639 --> 04:57.183
with nature, with other men, or with large animals.

04:58.545 --> 05:08.556
And there isn't really a tradition of American women's writing till you get to Edith Fortin and Willa Cather.

05:09.557 --> 05:15.304
And both of those are writers I came to late in life.

05:17.026 --> 05:21.351
So I can't say that my writing comes out of

05:22.107 --> 05:23.689
American writing.

05:25.252 --> 05:32.643
Do you see, and I think this is a pertinent question for you, because a number of your characters appear in different... That's true.

05:32.663 --> 05:33.384
You bring them back.

05:33.945 --> 05:36.789
And it does seem, they do seem to grow.

05:36.809 --> 05:40.395
I can't say I've read all of your books, but they do seem to grow in real time, too, don't they?

05:40.415 --> 05:40.996
Yes, they do.

05:41.917 --> 05:45.122
I have, you know, I have records on them, so I... Oh, you do?

05:45.242 --> 05:46.163
Oh, sure.

05:46.584 --> 05:47.666
I have to.

05:47.686 --> 05:48.267
I have to.

05:48.347 --> 05:48.587
Well,

05:49.023 --> 06:15.908
I started doing this after I read Anthony Pohl's Dance, the Music of Time, and as you probably know, he keeps bringing characters back, and they recur more than they do in my work, but that's because he's writing about upper-class British society between, well, I think probably start

06:16.394 --> 06:18.176
about the time of the First World War.

06:18.196 --> 06:19.137
I'm not sure about this.

06:19.197 --> 06:24.362
But anyway, he's writing about a smaller world than the one I live in.

06:25.003 --> 06:32.491
But in real life, you've probably noticed by now, people that you knew in the past will occasionally recur.

06:32.531 --> 06:35.034
Not always, but sometimes.

06:35.614 --> 06:43.903
So I feel that if you have a completely new cast of characters for every novel, unless, or even if,

06:44.305 --> 06:47.008
Every novel is set in a different part of the world.

06:47.828 --> 06:51.091
It's unnatural that you never get the same people again.

06:51.131 --> 07:05.965
And especially if you're writing about academics and writers and intellectuals and the people I write about, it would be unnatural if people didn't recur.

07:06.546 --> 07:08.087
So I started letting them recur.

07:08.127 --> 07:11.110
They inhabit a very precise world.

07:11.591 --> 07:14.093
It's not as small a world as

07:14.461 --> 07:18.785
But it is a world in which people do turn up again.

07:18.865 --> 07:20.267
And move in basically the same circle.

07:20.287 --> 07:21.568
And move in the same circle.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.170
Yeah.

07:24.391 --> 07:28.215
And they meet each other in different circumstances, but there they are again.

07:28.615 --> 07:33.981
Do you decide, well, I need a bubble head for this novel, so Barbie's perfect for this?

07:34.321 --> 07:38.045
No, it was more that I felt sorry for Barbie.

07:38.565 --> 07:44.451
I felt she was really one of the most confused and unhappy characters.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.094
I'd ever put into a book.

07:46.935 --> 07:48.717
And she was also an innocent.

07:49.398 --> 07:53.544
And I wanted her life to turn out a little better.

07:54.365 --> 07:56.368
So I thought, I'll bring her back.

07:57.229 --> 08:00.674
And I'll see what I can do for her.

08:01.395 --> 08:03.117
Well, did you help her to your satisfaction?

08:03.198 --> 08:05.240
Yes, I think she's going to be OK now.

08:05.341 --> 08:12.871
I mean, she didn't do too well between foreign affairs and the last resort.

08:12.891 --> 08:14.353
Things happened to her.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.524
She was pushed around by her awful mother.

08:19.664 --> 08:21.245
And, of course, she lost her father.

08:21.325 --> 08:22.046
It was very nice.

08:22.667 --> 08:27.791
And when she lost her father, she was unprotected.

08:28.752 --> 08:32.835
And she was forced into marriage with this politician.

08:33.756 --> 08:35.337
I mean, and so on.

08:35.618 --> 08:37.319
But now I think she's going to be all right.

08:38.160 --> 08:44.425
And I have no intention of betraying the resolution of this particular novel, because really it's not resolved.

08:44.793 --> 08:50.179
But you certainly do leave open the possibility, a number of possibilities here.

08:50.279 --> 08:56.265
Well, I don't mind saying what I, because I don't do much about what's going to happen to Barbie.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.546
She's only a minor character.

08:57.566 --> 09:00.149
Well, Barbie's mine, but I think Jenny and Lee.

09:00.770 --> 09:03.613
Well, there, it's more open-ended, I think.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.875
It depends on many things.

09:05.955 --> 09:13.703
And I didn't, I didn't want to come down on one side or the other, because I think that both

09:14.138 --> 09:18.202
possible futures are likely for someone in her position.

09:18.543 --> 09:20.805
It's the same way as in the war between the Tates.

09:21.666 --> 09:24.169
A man has an affair.

09:25.190 --> 09:41.648
His wife either forgives them and they make up and they live together reasonably happily ever after, perhaps very happily, or he behaves so badly that she can't forgive him or he

09:41.881 --> 09:44.905
leaves her for the new woman.

09:44.925 --> 09:47.308
And I felt that both of these things were possible.

09:47.908 --> 09:54.717
And this book was based upon a large number of cases in my own acquaintance in different universities.

09:55.398 --> 09:58.321
Because you, have you ever taught in a university?

09:59.002 --> 10:03.728
Well, you will one day.

10:03.748 --> 10:09.255
If you publish enough books, you can get, you can get a job teaching

10:09.708 --> 10:12.010
And I'd be good at it.

10:12.130 --> 10:12.351
What?

10:12.491 --> 10:13.311
I'd be good at it.

10:13.331 --> 10:13.652
You might.

10:13.672 --> 10:29.327
If you want to take time off from one author after another, you might look around, because there are now a lot of jobs for people who teach nonfiction writing and critical writing.

10:29.387 --> 10:31.109
There didn't used to be these jobs.

10:31.129 --> 10:32.570
It was just fiction and poetry.

10:33.050 --> 10:37.875
But I know that, for instance, my husband and I are going to

10:38.227 --> 10:46.496
a university in North Carolina next spring, and they've asked him, can he teach creative nonfiction?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.238
You could teach creative nonfiction.

10:48.338 --> 10:48.818
That's what I write.

10:48.838 --> 10:49.319
Yeah.

10:49.339 --> 10:52.142
And you might enjoy doing it for a term or a year.

10:52.162 --> 10:53.543
Yeah, because I use a lot of interviews.

10:53.763 --> 10:55.385
I also could teach the use of the interview.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.967
You could teach how to interview.

10:56.987 --> 10:57.727
How to review books.

10:57.788 --> 11:02.112
And what I would do is give the kids proofs of books that nobody's reviewed yet.

11:02.392 --> 11:03.393
Yeah, that would be interesting.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.655
And everyone gets a different book.

11:04.975 --> 11:06.276
And let's see.

11:06.517 --> 11:07.778
Or maybe...

11:07.859 --> 11:13.444
one book to two people, so we'll see what they did.

11:14.205 --> 11:20.891
I don't know what the possibilities are in this area, but I know there are possibilities.

11:20.912 --> 11:24.715
I'd like to work with smart kids, you know, graduate students.

11:24.735 --> 11:28.719
Anyway, let's put it.

11:29.320 --> 11:37.107
Anyway, so what I was saying was, one reason I wrote The War Between the Takes is because

11:37.340 --> 11:50.477
I knew of many cases in which professors had become involved with graduate students, or in one case with a much younger faculty, beginning faculty member.

11:50.617 --> 11:53.301
It's usually male with a younger female, isn't it?

11:53.421 --> 11:54.482
Yes, almost always.

11:54.542 --> 11:59.028
I don't think I know, certainly at that time I didn't know of any other cases.

11:59.489 --> 12:07.279
But it's because you have a world in which there are many young, attractive

12:07.546 --> 12:12.991
admiring women, which you don't get in most professions.

12:13.171 --> 12:21.739
Or if you do, as with doctors and nurses, there isn't such an overbalance on one side.

12:21.759 --> 12:29.566
I mean, there are many, many more students than there are professors, but there are not that many more nurses than there are doctors, not these days anyway.

12:29.846 --> 12:37.013
And many nurses, of course, are over 25, and they have their own families, you know.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.585
So it's an occupational hazard of professors.

12:41.406 --> 12:56.902
And this was in the 60s when suddenly the permissive society came in and you were supposed to express your individuality or follow your bliss or whatever, however you wanted to put it.

12:57.462 --> 13:03.068
And the result was that in many universities I knew about, this thing happened.

13:03.689 --> 13:08.674
And so I thought this would be a good subject for a book.

13:08.694 --> 13:09.655
Why does this happen?

13:09.695 --> 13:12.258
What's the result of it?

13:12.919 --> 13:22.849
And, of course, the problem was that in some cases, say I knew somewhere between five and ten cases of this happening.

13:23.710 --> 13:28.195
And in about half the cases, the couple made up.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.237
They went on.

13:30.571 --> 13:33.595
To look at the now, you'd never know that this had happened.

13:33.676 --> 13:36.420
It was just a blip on the screen.

13:36.440 --> 13:44.011
In about the other half, I don't know exactly 50-50, but more or less, the husband left the wife of the graduate student.

13:44.812 --> 13:47.636
So I felt at the end I couldn't come to a decision.

13:48.257 --> 13:50.420
I couldn't say it's going to go this way or that way.

13:50.801 --> 13:59.734
So you haven't decided whether or not she even likes her husband anymore, whether she'll... Well, I wanted to leave it open because...

13:59.984 --> 14:02.307
In real life, I saw it going both ways.

14:03.629 --> 14:12.320
This novel, and I think maybe you'll, I hope you'll agree, but it seems to me that all your novels can only be written at a time, at the time when they were written.

14:12.340 --> 14:13.201
Would you agree with that?

14:14.063 --> 14:19.830
I mean, you talked about, you know, the affair, and then it takes with an earlier novel that was a man and a woman.

14:20.391 --> 14:23.655
I don't think that you could have used this premise 20 years ago.

14:24.296 --> 14:29.603
No, I don't think you could, because this kind of relationship would have,

14:30.055 --> 14:33.059
been thought to be extremely strange and shocking.

14:33.079 --> 14:33.640
But not today.

14:33.980 --> 14:34.321
Not today.

14:34.341 --> 14:46.077
I mean, I assume that probably there were these relationships, but they didn't emerge and they weren't so easily accepted.

14:47.399 --> 14:52.266
In fact, the relationship here causing

14:52.803 --> 14:55.646
The disquietude is that between Jenny and her husband.

14:55.726 --> 14:56.407
Yeah.

14:56.427 --> 15:00.792
This Victorian woman walking anachronism kind of a thing.

15:01.273 --> 15:04.016
And I don't think you're judging that.

15:04.036 --> 15:21.797
No, in fact, one of, I mean, there were many motives for writing this, but one was, I feel that, say, 50 years ago, let alone 100 years ago, a woman was criticized if she wanted anything more than a husband and kids.

15:22.132 --> 15:32.826
You know, if you were married, you had small children, and you didn't spend practically all your time with them, there was something wrong with you.

15:33.808 --> 15:42.980
Now, if you have a husband and kids, and you don't want to go to work 40 hours a week and exhaust yourself, there's something wrong with you.

15:45.283 --> 15:50.991
You know, this commercial pressure and social pressure on women...

15:51.359 --> 15:56.525
to have a career, a career independent of their husband.

15:56.545 --> 16:01.951
And I believe that both options should be available for a woman.

16:01.971 --> 16:09.199
A woman should be able to stay home with her kids if that's what she wants to do, and she should be able to go out to work if that's what she wants to do.

16:10.420 --> 16:15.005
And I feel that women like Jenny are taking a lot of flack these days.

16:16.867 --> 16:19.290
Women who's

16:19.574 --> 16:25.080
principal interest is their family, or women who work with their husbands, like your wife, you know?

16:26.262 --> 16:28.925
So I wanted to speak up for women like this.

16:29.926 --> 16:33.971
In fact, I couldn't do what I knew about my wife.

16:34.031 --> 16:35.112
In fact, I wouldn't do it.

16:35.392 --> 16:40.919
Today, she's sending out photographs, for instance, to all our newspapers, photographs of the authors.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.061
If I had to do that, forget it.

16:43.081 --> 16:47.927
And very often, it's much different

16:48.447 --> 17:01.602
more interesting, exciting, and pleasant life that she will have doing this than if she had to get on a subway and go to some large corporation in Boston.

17:01.642 --> 17:06.207
Well, what she's doing with me is we've traveled to Italy.

17:06.227 --> 17:08.169
We've run all the great libraries in Italy.

17:08.530 --> 17:12.314
She interviewed Umberto Eco with me, had questions for Umberto Eco.

17:12.334 --> 17:15.197
She interviewed Father Boyle with me.

17:15.430 --> 17:44.323
you know been all over the world working on this new book together and we get together we have our conferences like she picks up things that totally get by yeah it's wonderful especially her takes on women and on men i have to say she has a sense of i'm more i'm usually i'm very good at detail but she's picking up nuances that that well you're probably both picking up things and you you compliment each other but anyway i i feel that what jenny does is is worthwhile and the fact that she doesn't want credit for it is perfectly

17:44.523 --> 17:45.224
reasonable.

17:45.244 --> 17:47.587
I mean, not everybody wants to be a public name.

17:48.008 --> 17:50.231
Some people hate to have a public name.

17:50.311 --> 17:53.675
Well, I offered her to do a byline on her children's book review.

17:53.695 --> 17:54.416
I wanted it.

17:54.536 --> 17:55.778
I said, you're doing all the work.

17:55.838 --> 17:57.720
I mean, she said, but you're the star.

17:58.001 --> 18:00.825
You're the one they know that goes out under your name.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.126
I don't need the byline.

18:02.767 --> 18:03.688
She loves the reviews.

18:05.090 --> 18:07.674
They give us a full page in Orlando, blah, blah, blah.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.098
And she said, my pride is in seeing the children's books done properly.

18:11.218 --> 18:12.400
Oh, that's cool.

18:12.740 --> 18:13.281
Yeah, I mean,

18:13.582 --> 18:17.126
Not everybody needs to have a public persona.

18:17.146 --> 18:18.347
An ego for them.

18:18.868 --> 18:19.288
Well, no.

18:19.428 --> 18:22.992
I mean, I'm sure she has an ego because everybody's got it.

18:23.413 --> 18:32.002
But I feel that Jenny is happier not having to perform as a public figure.

18:32.042 --> 18:34.225
She values her privacy, really.

18:34.245 --> 18:38.129
We were talking about books being appropriate for their times.

18:38.149 --> 18:39.851
And I don't know the word corpus.

18:40.311 --> 18:40.872
Some writers...

18:41.881 --> 18:43.363
who don't like to discuss it.

18:43.383 --> 18:47.689
They say, well, that's for the critics to determine after I'm no longer writing.

18:48.250 --> 18:52.356
But I think in your case, it is a body of work.

18:52.376 --> 18:53.037
Let's hope so.

18:53.278 --> 18:57.043
But that probably really would behoove the reader to know.

18:57.063 --> 19:09.441
I mean, we can pick this book up and read it as certainly it's intended to be read as a self-contained unit, but it certainly would help to know the provenance of some of these characters and...

19:10.045 --> 19:15.573
Readers who read all my books enjoy picking up references.

19:16.134 --> 19:23.525
It has a kind of crossword puzzle or, let's say, treasure hunt aspect, which they enjoy.

19:23.585 --> 19:26.089
Is it a game for you to play this, do you think?

19:26.469 --> 19:38.567
Well, I think the fact that it's a game for them is a byproduct of what I try to do to make the books connected so that they're not all separate worlds, but they're more

19:38.767 --> 19:39.708
like real life.

19:39.768 --> 19:43.053
So it is one fictive world for you then?

19:43.073 --> 19:44.154
Yeah, I think so.

19:46.737 --> 20:07.204
I did an interview here with Nadine Gordemar a couple years ago, she was in Cambridge, and she said, it's very interesting, she saw all of her books and she compared it with walking into a room where there's a statue, a piece of sculpture, and walking around and looking at the same piece of sculpture from a different perspective, from a different angle, and she compared all of her books as basically doing

20:07.606 --> 20:09.929
a different look at the same piece of sculpture.

20:12.072 --> 20:19.663
I don't mean to, you know, bring Nadine into this particular... That's interesting, though it's not the metaphor I would have chosen.

20:19.863 --> 20:22.888
I might have chosen that metaphor for her work, but not for my own.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.051
Okay, so you're anticipating my question.

20:25.111 --> 20:34.564
How do you see your different books, not as different aspects of... Well, for me, the world is not like a static piece of sculpture.

20:34.585 --> 20:36.347
It changes.

20:36.732 --> 20:38.034
Places change.

20:38.114 --> 20:38.955
People change.

20:39.496 --> 20:46.246
And therefore, I wouldn't use the metaphor of walking around a fixed object.

20:46.286 --> 20:46.947
What would you use?

20:47.528 --> 20:48.029
I don't know.

20:48.990 --> 20:52.816
You also would agree, though, that there are continuing threads in your work, though.

20:52.836 --> 20:53.156
Sure.

20:53.397 --> 20:54.017
That's true.

20:54.498 --> 21:04.613
But one thing I want my books to do, as you've suggested, is to have something to say about the way people

21:04.964 --> 21:07.808
the social and intellectual world changes.

21:12.013 --> 21:20.324
I mean, for instance, just in a very simplistic way, in my first novel, none of the women have jobs.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.689
They don't even consider that they might have jobs.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.232
This is in love and friendship.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.835
Nobody ever says, how come you have no job?

21:28.855 --> 21:34.583
The only person in the book, woman in the book, who has a job is a

21:34.900 --> 21:40.467
a minor character who works in a bank, and a minor character who's a waitress.

21:40.487 --> 21:43.350
I mean, that's scarcely mentioned, but they're unmarried young women.

21:43.370 --> 21:51.019
And isn't it interesting here, the first job that Jenny has had in 25 years is working as a clerk.

21:51.039 --> 21:51.740
That's right.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.203
For scale, for minimum wage, basically.

21:54.223 --> 21:55.345
Yes, she does.

21:55.465 --> 21:56.967
I understand, but it's her first job.

21:57.007 --> 21:57.527
That's right.

21:57.948 --> 22:00.351
And we're making, it's harking back to 1962.

22:00.371 --> 22:01.532
But I mean, even in,

22:01.715 --> 22:07.262
In 1960, even the women who have no children, oh, there's a cleaning woman, too.

22:07.762 --> 22:13.710
Working-class women have jobs in Apple, but middle-class women, whether or not they have children, have no jobs.

22:13.770 --> 22:16.773
Nobody seems to say to them, hey, how come you got no job?

22:18.335 --> 22:28.127
But as time goes on, my female characters begin to have part-time jobs, and then they have full-time jobs.

22:28.833 --> 22:34.021
You know, there's a quote I did pick up from, in fact, a couple of pieces I knew, and it goes basically like this.

22:34.041 --> 22:39.510
In my novels, the heroine has something in common with me, but none of them are me.

22:40.772 --> 22:42.896
Is that consistent here, too?

22:43.036 --> 22:43.477
Oh, yeah.

22:43.497 --> 22:55.296
I think that I put a little bit of myself into all of them, but as different bits, you know, depending on what was needed.

22:55.512 --> 23:00.960
So that applies here, but it would be a mistake to look for you in the novel, though.

23:00.980 --> 23:05.666
Well, I think here I'm more diffusely distributed.

23:05.887 --> 23:08.010
Ah, good question.

23:08.050 --> 23:24.793
I think that in a way, some of, in a way, I'm like the woman in her 80s, Molly, who, although very, very slightly, but

23:25.263 --> 23:45.291
Her thoughts about getting old, about wanting to go on living because she's so fascinated by the lives of her friends and her children and her grandchildren, although her life has become fairly static.

23:46.192 --> 23:50.118
And she doesn't want to die because life is so interesting.

23:50.378 --> 23:53.042
I'm familiar with that.

23:54.710 --> 24:13.454
I think that some of the thoughts that my hero, Wilkie, has about retirement have to do with thoughts I've had about how when you retire, you're no longer part of the main scene.

24:13.474 --> 24:21.544
You're no longer, you know, this remark, he has a terrible lecture agent who says to him, let's face it, you're no longer the flavor of the month.

24:21.980 --> 24:28.227
This is something that somebody, not my lecture agent, I hasten to say, said to me, you know.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.592
So you can't help but put a bit of yourself.

24:33.493 --> 24:36.456
I don't think there's much of me in Jenny, however.

24:36.496 --> 24:40.961
Do you have a sense of your reader who you're writing for?

24:42.002 --> 24:42.222
No.

24:42.282 --> 24:49.270
Although I, from giving readings, I realized that

24:50.127 --> 24:52.910
I do have a kind of reader.

24:52.930 --> 24:56.875
My readers tend to be over 30, if you'd expect.

24:57.356 --> 24:59.699
They tend to be people who read a lot.

25:01.280 --> 25:01.801
Gender?

25:02.442 --> 25:05.626
They're more women than men, of course.

25:05.686 --> 25:07.868
But women read more novels anyway than men.

25:07.888 --> 25:08.950
Women read more novels anyway.

25:09.651 --> 25:12.995
But I don't have a sense of a specific reader.

25:13.015 --> 25:14.496
Do you have a reader in mind when you're writing?

25:14.777 --> 25:15.898
No, not really.

25:16.925 --> 25:17.746
I don't think I do.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.729
So you're writing for yourself?

25:19.870 --> 25:26.961
Well, yes, I mean, I suppose in a very vague way, I think of everybody I know as a potential leader.

25:28.163 --> 25:31.388
I did an interview with Penelope Fitzgerald, in fact, the only one in the U.S.

25:31.408 --> 25:34.112
I did her six days before she went, and I was in London.

25:34.312 --> 25:35.013
Oh, yeah?

25:35.454 --> 25:36.756
I liked that story everywhere.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.022
She's quite an interesting woman.

25:40.042 --> 25:40.723
I don't know her.

25:41.083 --> 25:47.469
She has to know not only the first paragraph, but the last paragraph and the title before she starts.

25:48.250 --> 25:53.575
That's nice, but if I had that requirement, I'd never write anything.

25:53.795 --> 25:56.657
I guess what I'm leading to is serendipity is very important for you.

25:56.757 --> 25:59.180
Is it an exploration for you as you go along?

25:59.240 --> 26:03.163
Yeah, I always begin by making pages and pages of notes.

26:03.283 --> 26:07.367
I usually begin with a theme or something.

26:07.803 --> 26:12.510
observed in the world, and then I start making notes about it.

26:13.011 --> 26:14.854
Who might the characters be?

26:14.914 --> 26:16.536
Where might the thing take place?

26:16.676 --> 26:19.701
And I develop all these things.

26:19.721 --> 26:30.057
I couldn't, but I don't try to think what the words will be of the beginning or the end, or what the title will be, because the book will change as I'm writing it.

26:30.077 --> 26:31.599
And is it fun for it to change?

26:32.000 --> 26:32.440
Oh, yes.

26:32.561 --> 26:34.604
I mean, that's one of the attachments.

26:34.624 --> 26:36.747
You suddenly say, wait, I could...

26:37.334 --> 26:40.259
This could happen, or why not that, you know?

26:40.299 --> 26:51.940
For instance, in the last resort, I wanted there to be a campaign to save something.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.683
First I thought, well, it'll be dolphins.

26:54.344 --> 27:01.637
But then I was in Key West and went out on a canoe trip that you can go to.

27:01.938 --> 27:29.869
uh and a kayaking trip and uh saw a manatee in the water just like uh they do in the book and i thought well manatee would be better because uh it's a kind of a comic animal and it's also uh it's i mean dolphins have a a lot of support everybody knows knows about dolphins and loves dolphins and and this would be something

27:30.338 --> 27:51.029
new and more unusual and at the same time more comical because it would be a little bit like my hero and a little bit like Barbie, you know, so that he thinks that she looks like a manatee and she thinks that he looks like a manatee.

27:51.050 --> 27:59.282
You know, in the few reviews that I've read so far, they all seem to get to the affair between the two women right away, but

27:59.650 --> 28:02.454
If you read those reviews, that's really not what happens in this novel.

28:02.654 --> 28:04.016
It's not the fact.

28:04.036 --> 28:07.841
To me, to write this, that doesn't happen until well towards the end of the book.

28:07.861 --> 28:08.942
No, it's not the central theme.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.104
It's not the central theme.

28:10.124 --> 28:11.505
It disturbs me to read that.

28:12.647 --> 28:26.445
Because it's something I've never done, for a good reason that I don't have any experience in this area, only though I've had friends who've had similar... But that's, you know, the point is you've never felt moved to write about it before.

28:26.465 --> 28:27.546
That's all I've said.

28:27.566 --> 28:28.948
Well, no, it wasn't...

28:29.401 --> 28:33.785
I'm commenting, I guess, on the reviews of it.

28:33.885 --> 28:36.027
That's right.

28:36.067 --> 28:37.649
This is a new thing.

28:37.809 --> 28:38.670
I guess that's it.

28:39.611 --> 28:44.175
But it isn't what I started with when I wanted to write the novel.

28:45.456 --> 28:58.429
It came about partly because in my last novel there was a minor character who was a not terribly nice lesbian.

28:58.831 --> 29:03.936
And I got letters from some lesbians I know, which were quite hurt.

29:03.956 --> 29:05.998
And they said, how could you do this to us?

29:06.018 --> 29:07.599
So I said, well, maybe that's right.

29:07.619 --> 29:12.263
I should have put in a nice lesbian in there.

29:12.283 --> 29:13.845
So you do listen to your readers, don't you?

29:13.865 --> 29:13.965
What?

29:13.985 --> 29:15.346
You do listen to your readers, then.

29:15.366 --> 29:18.109
If they're friends, I certainly... You pay attention to their concerns.

29:18.129 --> 29:18.469
Oh, sure I do.

29:18.549 --> 29:28.078
Even if they're not... Even if I don't know them, I sometimes... I thought about this, but of course, reappears in my last novel, but she has a minor part in it.

29:28.295 --> 29:31.338
Not much is made of her sexuality, if anything.

29:34.962 --> 29:36.103
So there was that.

29:38.246 --> 29:50.599
More important than that, and something that I thought about earlier than that, is I wanted Jenny to become involved with someone who wouldn't find her husband more attractive than her.

29:50.619 --> 29:57.947
I mean, one of her problems is that he's such a famous, rather glamorous media figure.

29:58.653 --> 30:10.125
I mean, this is a problem that you and your wife don't have, and that you're not on, I mean, you're not constantly on television, and they're not, and maybe you are.

30:10.145 --> 30:10.726
What?

30:11.026 --> 30:12.728
I've been on C-Sprat a couple of times.

30:12.748 --> 30:14.230
Yeah, but you know what I mean?

30:14.330 --> 30:15.491
I know exactly what you mean.

30:15.511 --> 30:16.472
I'm not a media.

30:16.492 --> 30:18.915
He's made, he has become, will he?

30:18.935 --> 30:19.716
A personality.

30:19.736 --> 30:20.957
A personality.

30:21.338 --> 30:23.620
He's, you know, he's, he's.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.742
He's bigger than the sum of his works, basically.

30:25.762 --> 30:26.263
Yes, and he's.

30:26.497 --> 30:31.041
And he's famous for having climbed mountains and gone, you know, and all.

30:31.061 --> 30:47.816
So anyway, one of the things that Jenny has to complain about in a very quiet way is that she meets people, and they really partly want to know her because then they can get to know her famous husband.

30:48.736 --> 30:56.183
Except Jerry here wants to get to know her, and he's kind of a... Yeah, well, I mean, or else there are men who want to take her away from

30:56.382 --> 31:02.509
I mean, I don't think he's the first man who would like to scoop her up because she's such a good deal for a writer.

31:03.430 --> 31:15.424
But if it's not that, lots of the women she writes, her friends are really awed by her husband and they want to meet him.

31:15.624 --> 31:21.151
And I wanted her to become friends with somebody who had no interest in her husband.

31:21.711 --> 31:22.392
An interest in her.

31:22.853 --> 31:25.596
And instead was deeply interested in her.

31:25.913 --> 31:34.666
Because that's one of the wonderful, one of the attractive qualities of Lee for her is that, as she says, Lee is my friend, you know.

31:34.686 --> 31:53.052
And I think this is something that happens to the wives of celebrities, or maybe even the husbands of celebrities, I suppose, the Hollywood stars, is that they're never sure that they're light for themselves.

31:53.521 --> 31:57.226
I've heard it suggested that this is a bittersweet book.

31:57.947 --> 31:59.188
Would you say you write hopeful books?

31:59.328 --> 32:00.049
Are your books hopeful?

32:00.610 --> 32:03.273
Well, they're more hopeful than a lot of books I read, yeah.

32:04.375 --> 32:11.644
But then I think I'm a fairly optimistic person, but my life has been very fortunate, you know, so it's natural.

32:11.664 --> 32:18.432
So you have an optimistic outlook that resonates in the body of work.

32:19.745 --> 32:24.011
I've read also, well, let's dispense with Jerry first.

32:24.131 --> 32:25.332
Is he a caricature?

32:25.392 --> 32:26.894
Is he a Robert Blight?

32:26.914 --> 32:46.360
Well, I mean, he appears in an earlier book called Real People about an artist colony, and he's kind of an artificial construct in that he's a poet who's gone through different phases.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.043
At one point, he's a beat poet, and...

32:49.293 --> 32:53.839
Now he's... But he's written this book, which has identified him.

32:53.859 --> 32:54.781
Yeah, yeah.

32:54.801 --> 32:57.444
Now he's a sort of environmentalist poet.

32:57.464 --> 33:05.716
I mean, I... And he... I say in the book that he... Whatever some other poet does, he wants to do it too.

33:06.397 --> 33:09.120
And this a lot... That's a wonderful one.

33:09.140 --> 33:09.241
Yeah.

33:09.261 --> 33:18.253
But you see, this is good because this means that he can reappear in this book as a kind of Robert Bly poet, even though he was a different...

33:18.503 --> 33:23.790
But you don't dislike him.

33:23.951 --> 33:24.612
Oh, no.

33:25.032 --> 33:25.793
I'm fine with him.

33:25.853 --> 33:30.219
I mean, he really believes in literature.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.102
He really believes in the environment.

33:32.963 --> 33:35.667
And he's just a little bit childish.

33:35.687 --> 33:36.769
Some poets are like that.

33:36.789 --> 33:37.710
I don't know if you'll be familiar with him.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.915
You probably haven't interviewed as many poets.

33:39.935 --> 33:45.783
From my column I have, because I've interviewed Donald Hall and Stanley Kunitz.

33:46.003 --> 33:49.147
Stanley Kunitz is a very grown-up poet.

33:49.207 --> 33:50.628
Very grown-up poet.

33:51.129 --> 33:59.479
Don Hall, he's a wonderful guy and a very good poet.

33:59.780 --> 34:02.844
But he is slightly not as grown up as some people.

34:03.445 --> 34:04.787
Oh, please don't put that in.

34:04.887 --> 34:07.491
Enough bad things happen to him.

34:07.511 --> 34:08.913
I've never embarrassed anyone.

34:08.993 --> 34:10.655
These are 800-word stories.

34:11.196 --> 34:14.561
I mean, I've known him since college, of course.

34:14.581 --> 34:15.703
And I like him.

34:16.143 --> 34:22.532
But I do think he grew up a little more slowly than some people.

34:24.675 --> 34:26.658
So did Bob Bly if it comes to that.

34:26.818 --> 34:29.382
Although I think with Bob Bly,

34:30.053 --> 34:37.605
that off the record, he just didn't know how big this was going to be.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.448
I mean, it just swept him off his feet.

34:40.770 --> 34:45.217
Made him very wealthy, too, which changes your perspective a bit, doesn't it?

34:45.277 --> 34:45.898
That's true.

34:46.178 --> 34:58.137
I mean, but I don't think he ever had the thought, I will put on a rug and some beads, and I will go into the woods and drum, and then I will become very famous.

34:58.522 --> 34:59.343
Not at all.

35:00.144 --> 35:09.178
I think the public fame that this brought him came out of left field, he didn't spend it.

35:09.198 --> 35:11.622
Tell me briefly what your time constraints are, by the way.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.665
I think I should leave in about 10, 15 minutes.

35:13.685 --> 35:15.588
Okay, because there are a couple of things I didn't want to pick up.

35:15.608 --> 35:17.431
Do you mind I also want to take a couple of photographs?

35:17.872 --> 35:18.593
Sure, that's fine.

35:18.613 --> 35:19.935
I have some papers of high-color photos.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.357
Sure, okay.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.682
We can go outside where there's more air.

35:23.903 --> 35:25.405
Oh, if you did, that would be nice.

35:25.465 --> 35:27.467
And there's a lot of stuff I haven't asked you.

35:27.507 --> 35:28.589
I have material on it.

35:28.629 --> 35:29.190
That's okay.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.252
You can just pick it up from here and there.

35:31.373 --> 35:40.064
And I haven't, and I know this through so many of the stories, there's a lot of things that they repeat biographically, which is tedious.

35:40.144 --> 35:44.730
And I don't even see where it has any place in a story about an author, you know.

35:44.750 --> 35:49.717
But sometimes they don't have enough material, and therefore they need to repeat these things.

35:49.737 --> 35:49.837
Yeah.

35:49.877 --> 35:49.977
Yeah.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.685
But don't worry about it coming from here.

35:52.725 --> 35:54.167
You did change universities here.

35:54.427 --> 35:56.650
I think maybe you needed Jenny to be a New Englander.

35:56.730 --> 35:57.391
Is that kind of it?

35:57.411 --> 36:01.757
There are actually two universities in my work.

36:01.797 --> 36:05.702
There's Corinth, which is slightly based on Cornell.

36:05.962 --> 36:09.747
And then there's Converse, which is slightly based on Amherst.

36:10.308 --> 36:11.630
And it's a college.

36:11.650 --> 36:13.572
It's not a university.

36:13.712 --> 36:17.297
Whereas Corinth is a university.

36:17.530 --> 36:21.476
Corinth is located in a vague area, which could be... Not unlike Ithaca.

36:21.556 --> 36:24.180
Not unlike Ithaca in the northeast.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.924
Congress is definitely located in the region.

36:26.944 --> 36:29.227
Maybe in the Berkshires, something like that.

36:29.247 --> 36:30.028
That was my sense.

36:30.048 --> 36:30.269
Yeah.

36:30.669 --> 36:36.758
So you just, you feel, you know, one of these is right for this particular... Yes.

36:36.778 --> 36:44.770
But we do have people that, as you said earlier, who kind of move around and... Yeah, I think that...

36:46.572 --> 36:51.898
I think that Jenny's life would have been different if her husband had been a professor at Corinth.

36:52.298 --> 36:53.559
That's my feeling, too.

36:54.901 --> 37:00.066
He picked New England for her, to return her there from California, where she belonged.

37:00.166 --> 37:00.647
That's right.

37:00.767 --> 37:08.855
And she needed, for her to live this life, she needed a smaller, more isolated environment.

37:08.875 --> 37:11.598
She might have maybe emerged in a big university.

37:11.958 --> 37:16.343
Yes, I think there would have been more for her to do, she would have had,

37:16.762 --> 37:18.924
different kinds of friends.

37:19.025 --> 37:23.750
I mean, I don't know for sure, but it felt right for her to be at a small New England college.

37:24.831 --> 37:26.132
A general comment.

37:26.153 --> 37:33.421
Is there still for you a comment in 1998 about the relevance of a literary novel in this day and age?

37:33.681 --> 37:35.623
Do you have a thought on that for me?

37:36.424 --> 37:40.909
Well, I mean, people are still writing them, and people are still reading them in great numbers, you know?

37:41.410 --> 37:41.930
In great numbers?

37:42.511 --> 37:42.891
Well, yes.

37:43.192 --> 37:44.473
I mean,

37:45.297 --> 37:48.723
I mean, look at the sales of some really good novels.

37:49.524 --> 37:51.287
Bob Stone just made the bestseller.

37:51.307 --> 37:52.950
Oh, good, did he?

37:53.070 --> 37:55.114
I'm so delighted, and so will he be.

37:55.294 --> 38:00.864
He was at Alfred Kazin's, he picked him number one in his pantheon of living.

38:01.525 --> 38:02.607
Oh, that's very nice.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.530
Does Bob know this?

38:04.550 --> 38:05.732
I mentioned that to him, yeah.

38:05.752 --> 38:06.934
That's good, yeah.

38:07.218 --> 38:31.470
and and i said who else well of course he does deal with holocaust issues to it really yeah it means a lot it meant a lot to him meant a lot but he loves stone and and i'm not looking for people's favorite authors but uh when i interviewed harold bloomby was quoting philip rock who believes that there are perhaps only 50 000 serious readers in the world or the united states would you do subscribe to that

38:31.889 --> 38:33.511
which we call a serious reader?

38:33.631 --> 38:36.774
Well, without a count, which we say it's a finite, small number.

38:36.814 --> 38:43.020
If I were to tell you that the census tells us that the average American reads no more than 17 minutes of a book a day.

38:43.761 --> 39:01.879
Well, that's—but the thing is, I think he's wrong, because I think that there are people who may not read the way you read or I read, but, for instance, I have—one of my sons is—works for digital computers.

39:02.028 --> 39:09.517
And he and his friends, occasionally, through some accident, a book will come into their life.

39:09.697 --> 39:11.299
And they'll read it seriously.

39:12.841 --> 39:18.868
Same as two of my two other sons, neither of them in the university.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.532
But occasionally they'll read something.

39:21.812 --> 39:22.593
They'll hear about it.

39:22.613 --> 39:23.194
They'll read it.

39:23.774 --> 39:27.279
It might be something that's very famous, like Cold Mountain.

39:27.299 --> 39:30.162
And they'll say, hey, I just read this wonderful book.

39:30.867 --> 39:38.255
So I think that there are people that we don't think of as serious readers who occasionally read seriously.

39:39.016 --> 39:39.297
Okay.

39:39.697 --> 39:47.706
And then could you give me a brief comment about your continuing interest in children's literature and why this is what you teach at Cornell, in addition to other things.

39:47.726 --> 39:49.688
I mean, you teach folklore and writing, I guess, as well.

39:50.129 --> 39:52.892
But children's literature has been a continuing interest for you.

39:52.912 --> 39:57.177
When I started to teach, I still had fairly young children.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.980
And I was interested in...

40:00.179 --> 40:02.082
the books they read and the books they liked.

40:02.743 --> 40:16.023
Also, when I started to teach, I was a junior member of the department, and when I wanted to teach a literature course, all the other writers that I would have liked to teach belonged to someone else.

40:17.245 --> 40:23.494
I mean, I couldn't teach modern British fiction because somebody was teaching that.

40:24.276 --> 40:28.482
So this was a place where I could invent a course of my own.

40:29.508 --> 40:36.698
And I also believe that good children's books are just as good as good adult books.

40:36.718 --> 40:38.821
That's a quote you can be sure that will show up in this piece.

40:38.861 --> 40:40.664
Yeah, but it's true.

40:41.565 --> 40:55.986
I think that, I mean, it's easier to see in terms of 19th century classics like Alice in Wonderland and Little Women, that these are really first-rate novels.

40:56.006 --> 40:56.106
Yeah.

40:56.423 --> 41:00.226
All I say to a writer is try to write a children's book and see how easy it is.

41:00.727 --> 41:04.009
It's not so easy, but if you have kids?

41:04.029 --> 41:04.730
I have two daughters.

41:05.511 --> 41:14.118
Well, I think you either have to have kids of your own or be very close to someone else's kids to write a good children's book.

41:14.478 --> 41:14.858
I think so.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.540
I think absolutely.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.461
Let's see if I had one other question.

41:18.622 --> 41:22.285
Of course, that's not true of Sendak, as far as I know.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.707
No, he's never been married.

41:24.727 --> 41:26.228
No, I know he's never been married.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.531
And I don't think he's particularly close to kids.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.556
But his books really aren't necessarily for kids either.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.760
Yeah, but he's close to his own childhood.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.283
That's another part of the book.

41:35.303 --> 41:37.787
That's exactly it.

41:37.807 --> 41:40.271
But that's a whole other... I should send you a copy of my Sendak piece.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.054
I think it's pretty good.

41:43.897 --> 41:44.919
What else can I ask?

41:44.959 --> 41:47.043
I think we've covered a lot of ground.

41:47.323 --> 41:48.745
Okay, well, let's go.

41:48.806 --> 41:50.308
Would you inscribe...
