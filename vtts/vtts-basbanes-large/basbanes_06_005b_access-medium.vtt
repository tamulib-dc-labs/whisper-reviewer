00:01.398 --> 00:29.953
But I notice now, with a great deal of regret and chagrin, that the Wallace Stevens collection, which is complete as far as my bibliography is concerned anyway, is something that I practically never touch.

00:30.068 --> 00:44.983
And once in a blue moon, if I see something in a catalog that perhaps betters what I have, I may get it.

00:45.644 --> 00:59.097
But I suppose the best thing for me to do would be to find the best way of disposing of that collection, where it would do more good than

00:59.431 --> 01:01.634
just gathering dust on my shells.

01:04.539 --> 01:07.323
I don't know what I really mean by doing more good.

01:07.744 --> 01:23.087
Maybe it would do some good to find a home for it in a college or university library where there is a strong literature department and where there's an interest in Stevens and his work.

01:23.988 --> 01:28.695
Or maybe doing good would mean putting those books up for

01:29.198 --> 01:37.750
uh, auctions, uh, or selling them to a dealer, so somebody else will have, could have the same pleasure of, uh, collecting that I did.

01:38.111 --> 01:38.592
I don't know.

01:38.612 --> 01:39.953
How do you feel about that?

01:39.973 --> 01:41.976
I really don't know how I feel about that.

01:41.996 --> 01:46.463
How do you feel about that, not as far as the Wallace Stevens collection, but in general?

01:46.483 --> 01:46.944
In general.

01:46.964 --> 01:49.467
About giving the next generation of poets to this guy?

01:49.888 --> 01:50.809
No, I'm all for it.

01:51.230 --> 01:51.911
I'm all for it.

01:52.391 --> 01:59.121
And someday here at the Getty, we will have fantastic sales of material, because we have

01:59.523 --> 02:03.168
Because we have great duplicates.

02:14.943 --> 02:19.189
We haven't done anything of that on a grand scale as yet, but we will.

02:23.234 --> 02:23.715
Probably.

02:24.196 --> 02:25.277
We'll do it in two ways.

02:25.696 --> 02:41.354
We will do it through auction, and we will do it by offering our friends in the trade, with whom we've done business over the years, certain materials in trade.

02:43.476 --> 02:54.589
And because we know that these are dealers who will always have,

02:55.447 --> 03:00.012
in time will have material of interest to us.

03:00.033 --> 03:12.027
The problem will be trying to satisfy all of our friends in the trade, because I'm very proud of my personal relationships with the members of the book trade and the institutional ones.

03:12.187 --> 03:15.471
And I don't think it would be fair.

03:15.531 --> 03:17.594
I don't think the trust would let me, for that matter.

03:18.395 --> 03:25.403
But I don't think it would be fair to allow this

03:25.619 --> 03:36.696
kind of lucrative exchange to give this kind of exchange on to only one or two dealers.

03:36.756 --> 03:38.699
We'll have to spread it out.

03:38.779 --> 03:46.070
You wouldn't consider starting a kind of relationship, say, between Harry Ransom and Luke Feldman?

03:46.090 --> 03:46.331
No.

03:47.392 --> 03:48.434
I would definitely not.

03:48.774 --> 03:50.557
I want to talk about it at some point.

03:50.577 --> 03:50.778
Oh, yeah.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.679
I knew Luke Feldman.

03:52.080 --> 03:52.580
Excellence.

03:53.782 --> 03:54.343
Excellence.

03:54.982 --> 03:57.204
Quality.

03:57.285 --> 03:59.667
But it was not quality, it was always Cavallity.

04:03.111 --> 04:11.240
Luke Feldman was somebody you must have heard a lot about from many people.

04:11.621 --> 04:13.162
But he was an extraordinary man.

04:14.083 --> 04:21.432
A lot of people say that he was just a merchant and it wouldn't have made any difference what he would sell.

04:21.912 --> 04:22.693
I disagree.

04:23.011 --> 04:31.780
He had a real feel for books, and he loved, I don't know, maybe loved them is too strong a word, but he enjoyed them.

04:32.241 --> 04:40.370
And he had some, he had more than a small knowledge about, about a lot of the materials that he sold.

04:41.171 --> 04:50.841
And he was very good to young people, and I was young when I knew him, and he was generous with his time and his knowledge.

04:51.327 --> 04:57.452
And I remember going to his apartment in New York across the street from the old Barbizon.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.936
I remember it was across the street from the old Barbizon Hotel for Women.

05:02.797 --> 05:05.440
I think it was 62nd and Lexington Avenue.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.163
He was always very generous, pointing out things.

05:09.183 --> 05:09.743
Very nice.

05:11.565 --> 05:13.066
The House of LDF.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.888
The House of LDF.

05:14.908 --> 05:16.629
Lou David Feldman.

05:16.649 --> 05:16.830
Yeah.

05:17.971 --> 05:19.512
That's about LDF.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.363
Yes, it was really, yes, as if they were in Arabic.

05:22.724 --> 05:24.026
Yeah, name, yeah.

05:24.667 --> 05:32.698
Yeah, he was a garrulous, talkative, kind of, kind of man, like that, liked a good time.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.923
Yeah, he had a rather extraordinary relationship.

05:38.206 --> 05:41.991
Yes, it caused a problem between us, actually.

05:42.011 --> 05:43.373
Meaning between you, personal?

05:43.393 --> 05:48.300
Yes, yeah, and it's a good book story, so I'll tell it to you if you want to know.

05:48.972 --> 06:06.218
When I was at the Library of Congress, because I was also at the Library of Congress, you know, for a long time, Fred Goff, the Incunabulous, was the head of the Rare Book Division at the Library of Congress.

06:06.959 --> 06:17.815
And I was the second in command there for quite a number of years, all during the 1950s when I left there.

06:18.655 --> 06:25.885
in 1962 to go to the University of California.

06:25.905 --> 06:33.656
And, uh, so, uh, I had made the acquaintance of a woman named Caress Crosby.

06:36.319 --> 06:36.840
How old did he spell that?

06:36.860 --> 06:43.169
He spelled that Caress, as in Caress, C-A-R-E-S-S-E, Crosby.

06:43.749 --> 06:47.194
Caress Crosby and her husband, Harry Crosby,

06:47.697 --> 06:52.502
were a very famous expatriate couple, Black Sun Press.

06:53.182 --> 07:02.391
And I had been very interested in the Black Sun Press, and I was thrilled when I realized that Karras Crosby lived in Washington.

07:03.172 --> 07:07.556
And I got to meet her through a number of interesting events.

07:08.998 --> 07:15.544
My wife went to college with a young,

07:15.676 --> 07:22.086
with another woman who was a friend of Caress Crosby's and came to Washington to live in her house.

07:22.707 --> 07:24.791
And so we got together, and we saw a lot of each other.

07:26.994 --> 07:37.951
And Caress asked me at one point, would I like the job of cataloging her collection of the Black Sun Press material?

07:39.254 --> 07:43.320
And I said, yeah, I'd love it, but, you know, I've got a full-time job.

07:43.452 --> 07:48.177
It takes a lot of time, and so on.

07:48.618 --> 07:58.128
And it isn't as if you had a connection with the Library of Congress, or your books were going to come there, or anything of that kind.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.412
And if that were the case, things might be different.

08:02.213 --> 08:03.474
Well, this was wonderful.

08:03.554 --> 08:04.996
She took that hint.

08:05.016 --> 08:06.958
She really did on that one.

08:07.899 --> 08:12.244
And I'm making, I'm compressing the story, making a long story short.

08:12.747 --> 08:33.591
We made a deal, which was legalized and contract and all of that through the Library of Congress legal counsel and whatnot, that I would spend, I've forgotten what it was now, a couple of afternoons a week or something like that,

08:34.752 --> 09:01.300
And her house, she had a very pretty little house just above DuPont Circle in Washington, and I would go there about, say, twice a week or so, and I would make a checklist catalog of sorts of her collection, and that in time, whatever the given time was,

09:01.567 --> 09:06.452
this collection would come to the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress as a gift.

09:08.434 --> 09:09.795
So everybody was very happy.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.458
And I did this for a period of time.

09:12.478 --> 09:18.204
It's been a long, many, many months, I think a year, I can't remember now, doing this.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.126
And, of course, we got to know each other very well.

09:24.010 --> 09:30.156
She got, at just about the end of the year at work, a request.

09:31.115 --> 09:37.885
from the American Embassy to Rome.

09:40.689 --> 09:52.546
She got a request to show, to make an exhibit of the Black Sun Press in Rome, which was going to be sponsored either by the American Embassy or the USIA, something like that.

09:52.566 --> 09:54.849
And she was very thrilled and happy about this.

09:57.133 --> 10:00.818
And we helped her.

10:01.439 --> 10:14.039
select the stuff for the exhibit, I did, and the Library of Congress, the facilities of the Library of Congress were used to wrap the stuff up and send it to Rome.

10:18.786 --> 10:28.982
While it was in Rome, Lou Feldman, somehow or another,

10:29.738 --> 10:47.724
learned about the collection, or met Cress Crosby, and told her that, and I'm putting words in the man's mouth, and he's no longer around to correct them, but essentially what happened was this.

10:47.784 --> 10:57.518
He told her that it's a very nice thing to give all this stuff away to the nation, but did she realize how much

10:58.156 --> 11:04.545
His friend, Harry Ransom, and the University of Texas were prepared to pay her for this.

11:04.725 --> 11:21.109
Well, the timing for him was very good, because just at that moment, just at that time, Carest Crosby had bought a huge castle outside of Rome.

11:21.129 --> 11:23.472
I don't know, something like 400 rooms.

11:23.840 --> 11:34.671
No roof and no water and this and the other, and she was going to set up a sort of writer's colony and a place that was going to work for peace and all sorts of good things.

11:35.511 --> 11:53.509
And although she was a very wealthy woman, this was an extremely expensive project, and she liked the idea of getting this large sum of money, which he said the Black Sun Press collection was worth, and indeed it was.

11:54.316 --> 11:56.820
Oh, no.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.187
I mean, I'm sure he quoted a figure to her, but if I did know, I don't remember.

12:01.207 --> 12:03.892
I didn't realize it was more than the Library of Congress.

12:04.533 --> 12:05.955
We were not going to pay anything.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.998
She was going to give it in return for our cataloging.

12:08.018 --> 12:19.497
She was going to give it, in a sense, in return for my cataloging, but just as a generous gift to the nation.

12:20.236 --> 12:23.681
And this was a spectacular collection, mind you.

12:23.701 --> 12:34.597
These were not just a collection of the Black Sun Press book, but enormous amounts of correspondence, and manuscripts, and ephemera, and photographs, and really lovely.

12:35.778 --> 12:46.814
So, uh, this was, uh, yeah, yeah, late 50s.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.096
Yeah, something like that.

12:48.116 --> 12:49.618
I don't remember the years.

12:51.218 --> 13:10.706
So, I got wind of this, and I said, and I wrote to her intuitively, I said, what's the story?

13:10.726 --> 13:12.468
And this was the story.

13:13.750 --> 13:18.036
And then she realized the monetary value, and she needed so much,

13:18.640 --> 13:21.683
money for Ropa Sinibalda, the name of the castle.

13:22.824 --> 13:37.138
And she felt very guilty about putting in a swimming pool up there at the castle at the top of the hill when the people in the little village at the bottom of the hill didn't have water.

13:37.719 --> 13:40.902
They had to go pump it from somewhere else.

13:41.542 --> 13:45.306
So to assuage her guilt, she brought water to the town.

13:46.012 --> 13:52.902
So, you know, all this money seemed very attractive.

13:53.523 --> 14:11.310
Well, to cut this short again, I went, naturally, to Fred Goff, and then I went to the Librarian of Congress, and the Librarian of Congress spoke to the lawyer, and the lawyers spoke to the lawyers from the University of Texas.

14:12.050 --> 14:22.623
and papers were exchanged, and her agreement with us was placed in evidence, and it was a very, very trying, very unpleasant.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.565
Where was this court?

14:24.665 --> 14:27.989
I could probably look up some papers if it was in the court.

14:28.009 --> 14:29.731
Oh, no, I don't—it never went to court.

14:29.751 --> 14:32.154
It just was— There were no papers you ever filed to the court.

14:32.314 --> 14:35.138
No, I don't think it—no, as I recall, it never went to court.

14:35.478 --> 14:40.504
No, I'm just saying one set of lawyers showing the other, you see.

14:40.940 --> 14:51.131
And Harry Ransom was told by the Librarian of Congress, look, you don't do things like this.

14:53.413 --> 14:53.973
The upshot.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.855
Who was the Librarian of Congress?

14:55.895 --> 14:59.159
Werner Clapp.

15:01.121 --> 15:02.803
You just don't do things like this.

15:04.024 --> 15:08.989
And the upshot of it was a very sad one, that she said,

15:11.163 --> 15:14.027
Neither Texas nor California got it.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.873
Nor Library of Congress, excuse me, not California.

15:19.133 --> 15:19.454
Got it.

15:19.994 --> 15:21.036
She was so upset.

15:21.396 --> 15:23.279
She abrogated the agreement.

15:23.299 --> 15:25.021
She abrogated the agreement entirely.

15:25.141 --> 15:34.734
I mean, she did not sell it to Texas, you see, so she could not be taken to court for breaking her word to the Library of Congress.

15:35.995 --> 15:39.600
But she just didn't sell it or give it at all in her lifetime.

15:40.778 --> 16:01.045
And she left it to, I can't think of his name now, a nice man, the executive of her estate, who took it to his university in Carbondale, Southern Illinois.

16:02.367 --> 16:03.188
And that's where it is.

16:05.631 --> 16:05.972
Oh, yeah.

16:05.992 --> 16:10.718
And this, of course, is one of the great jewels in their crown.

16:11.052 --> 16:19.443
But for a long time, Lou Feldman and I sort of didn't speak with one another.

16:20.604 --> 16:32.339
And for a very long time, Chris Crosby didn't speak to me because she felt that I had ruined her chances to make a lot of money.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.842
But she didn't need the money, right?

16:34.862 --> 16:38.988
Well, I mean, it's hard to say who needs it and who doesn't need it.

16:39.048 --> 16:40.890
No, as I said, she was a wealthy woman.

16:41.326 --> 16:45.252
But she also did many, you know, she had very many expenses.

16:46.474 --> 16:49.519
Not a word.

16:50.220 --> 16:50.740
Not a word.

16:51.962 --> 16:57.090
He wrote a biography of Harry Crosby, which was stupid.

16:57.110 --> 16:59.574
But I reviewed that book for the New Republic magazine.

16:59.674 --> 17:02.078
And it's a horrible book.

17:02.699 --> 17:04.922
And he chose the less interesting of the pair.

17:04.942 --> 17:08.608
You see, Harry Crosby was not a terribly interesting man.

17:08.648 --> 17:10.050
It was not.

17:10.385 --> 17:13.568
I mean, it was Keres Crosby who was the interesting one.

17:13.588 --> 17:14.529
She had the taste.

17:15.490 --> 17:18.533
The press was her idea.

17:19.474 --> 17:28.083
And you'll notice that it wasn't until after Harry Crosby's death in 1929 that the press really became into its own.

17:28.704 --> 17:39.295
Before that, they printed silly stuff and a lot of it his own ranting and ravings.

17:39.545 --> 17:41.188
He wasn't a fool.

17:41.368 --> 17:51.205
He was a rich man who never really worked, who had very strange ideas.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.129
He was very narcissistic.

17:54.792 --> 17:59.240
Didn't he steal some of her rare books once and sell them to his parents?

17:59.260 --> 18:00.061
He may have.

18:00.361 --> 18:01.904
He may have.

18:02.085 --> 18:03.527
I don't know.

18:04.233 --> 18:31.236
Anyway, I didn't, she and I didn't speak for Verlaine, and I was, this disturbed me greatly because I was very fond of her, and, uh, and not only had I, was I in her house twice a week, uh, two afternoons a week cataloging this stuff, but we saw, my wife and I saw her socially very often, um, and even evenings in her house, or she and I, she was very fond of our, uh,

18:32.161 --> 18:37.908
uh, first child, uh, was born while we were just living in Washington.

18:38.669 --> 18:44.436
And, uh, uh, and we had very good times together, and she was very generous to us.

18:45.918 --> 18:49.122
Uh, so, uh, I felt very, very badly about this.

18:50.043 --> 19:01.016
And, uh, I was very happy that just before she died, uh, there was a meeting of the James Joyce Society at the Gotham Book Mart in New York.

19:01.036 --> 19:01.797
And, uh,

19:02.131 --> 19:05.336
She was a member, and I was, and I still am a member.

19:06.337 --> 19:16.253
And I had come, I was in New York, and so I decided to go to a meeting of the Society at the Gotham Book Mart.

19:16.273 --> 19:18.877
Francis Stelloff, of course, was still living then.

19:18.917 --> 19:26.829
And I was standing in the front of the, the meetings were always held in the back room of the bookshop.

19:27.630 --> 19:28.712
I was standing in the front.

19:30.818 --> 19:33.281
waiting for the meeting to start.

19:33.301 --> 19:39.388
And in walked Caress Crosby, and I'll never forget, she was a very beautiful woman, even in her old age.

19:40.790 --> 19:53.025
She died in the 70s, in her 70s, late 70s, in, I forgot my year, in her 72, 74, something like that.

19:53.045 --> 20:00.133
And she herself was in her 70s and still very beautiful.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.985
a really, really, really very handsome woman.

20:04.566 --> 20:05.867
I saw her walk in.

20:06.547 --> 20:08.369
She was wearing this huge fur coat.

20:09.450 --> 20:17.216
And she came in the front door of the Dr. Wilkmar.

20:17.236 --> 20:20.499
And I was standing about the middle of the front room of the store.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.422
And she looked at me, and I looked at her.

20:25.484 --> 20:29.547
And she put her arms out, like that.

20:29.847 --> 20:31.690
And we embraced, and we both cried.

20:32.211 --> 20:40.686
Yeah, and we had a big, you know, we had a big cry, and kissed, and all that sort of thing.

20:41.387 --> 20:45.514
And then that's the last I ever saw it.

20:45.534 --> 20:49.621
Yeah, and I was very, very happy about that, because we had been good friends.

20:50.502 --> 20:54.910
And I was very sad that this had broken up over,

20:55.075 --> 20:56.597
He was outside of your control.

20:56.717 --> 20:57.918
He was outside of control?

20:58.399 --> 21:16.999
Yeah, and you know, she fell for this story, which no doubt would have been true, about all this money that she would have made from the University of Texas if she didn't give this stuff away but sold it to them.

21:17.059 --> 21:18.882
Anyway, that's how that ended.

21:18.902 --> 21:24.728
That does give you a little bit of insight on Lee David Silva's book, doesn't it?

21:24.995 --> 21:30.922
Well, Lou Feldman said to me at a later point, he said, I didn't know, and she didn't tell me.

21:32.484 --> 21:34.667
Now, I don't know whether this is true or not.

21:36.248 --> 21:50.125
I had thought that we at the Library of Congress in those days had made it as public fact as possible, but maybe it was something he missed.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.214
and everyone should have let the stuff go to Rome.

21:54.696 --> 21:56.377
Yeah, anyway.

21:56.918 --> 21:57.859
How about Harry Larson?

21:57.879 --> 21:58.379
Did you know Harry?

21:58.399 --> 22:00.921
No, I never met him, no.

22:00.981 --> 22:05.185
What do you, do you have any wisdom to share on these?

22:05.205 --> 22:10.450
I mean, a usual kind of relationship, say, that exists at least when Harry and you and Selvin were?

22:10.470 --> 22:10.690
No.

22:10.770 --> 22:13.152
Selvin was essentially the exclusive agent.

22:13.512 --> 22:14.573
No, I don't, I don't.

22:14.633 --> 22:20.078
I know that this kind of thing happens with collectors.

22:20.446 --> 22:37.882
and dealers, and I suppose it happens to institutions and dealers, who sort of say, you know, that everything always seems to have to pass through one mind or one set of hands.

22:38.383 --> 22:48.512
I mean, it's always been a puzzle to me, as well as to many other people, the reliance that Bradley Martin had on

22:49.268 --> 22:55.836
I'll do with Dave Kirstenbaum of Carnegie Books, for example.

22:56.491 --> 22:57.833
Dave is still living, isn't he?

22:57.853 --> 22:58.855
He must be an old man.

22:59.115 --> 23:00.337
He's still working, isn't he?

23:00.357 --> 23:04.723
He's 96 years old on January 10th, and I called him at his shop to wish him a happy birthday.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.504
No kidding.

23:05.544 --> 23:06.766
I really ought to write that down.

23:06.846 --> 23:07.367
I ought to count it.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.610
He's there from 9 to 12, Monday to Friday.

23:09.630 --> 23:10.752
I should really see him.

23:10.912 --> 23:11.533
I wish he would.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.797
He goes to all the sales.

23:13.817 --> 23:15.639
January 10th, Dave.

23:15.659 --> 23:17.242
January 10th is the birthday.

23:17.702 --> 23:20.927
I... Yeah.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.511
He's there from 9 to 12, Monday to Friday.

23:23.710 --> 23:25.453
Fascinating.

23:25.673 --> 23:31.481
Fascinating because he will be 96 or he isn't?

23:31.742 --> 23:32.222
He was 96.

23:32.242 --> 23:34.506
He'll be 97 this night.

23:34.526 --> 23:37.430
I saw him at the last Bradley Martin sale.

23:37.450 --> 23:51.471
Because when I was at New York University, I used to see him about once a week because he had the same kind of relationship with Commodore Fails.

23:52.132 --> 23:52.452
He mentioned it.

23:53.309 --> 23:57.555
His first name I can't remember.

23:57.575 --> 23:58.516
DeCourcy.

23:58.536 --> 23:58.997
That was it.

23:59.277 --> 24:00.339
DeCourcy Fails.

24:00.359 --> 24:07.249
He was always called Commodore because at one point in his life he was the Commodore of the New York Yacht Club.

24:08.190 --> 24:18.945
And Fails, when I came to New York for that very brief episode in my career, had just given

24:19.567 --> 24:34.322
the Thales collection of literature to NYU, and a lot of it either acquired through Dave Kirshenbaum or with Dave's help.

24:34.342 --> 24:47.835
And these guys in those days, like most of us in former times, really loved to eat and drink, too, occasionally.

24:48.473 --> 25:06.011
And one of the duties of my job was to go have lunch with Fales and Dave Kirchenbaum twice a week.

25:07.433 --> 25:17.063
It had to be twice a week because when Dave was the host for lunch,

25:17.380 --> 25:18.642
We would eat at Joe's.

25:19.122 --> 25:20.064
Is it Joe's?

25:21.265 --> 25:22.567
I think, I can't remember.

25:22.587 --> 25:25.791
I think it's, well, I can't remember the name.

25:26.532 --> 25:28.155
No, Joe's is another place.

25:28.735 --> 25:46.780
But there was, and there still is, I know it's still there, an Italian restaurant on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 61st and, no, between 60th and 61st.

25:47.857 --> 26:12.413
an Italian restaurant yeah now now the Carnegie's on the corner what 59th it's right it's right across the street from Bloomingdale's right on the corner well so if the Carnegie's on the corner of 59th and Lexington stairs right right then uh

26:12.730 --> 26:21.979
Then, I think this restaurant is between 60th and 61st on the west side of the street.

26:22.019 --> 26:23.060
I know it's still there.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.104
So, once a week, and actually fails.

26:27.704 --> 26:29.286
He's an old man by this time.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.767
He didn't have anything else to do.

26:30.807 --> 26:41.758
And so it was my duty to keep him happy, because here he was, a big donor to NYU.

26:42.363 --> 26:46.609
And, uh, we were always hoping there would be more, uh, to come.

26:47.911 --> 27:02.811
Uh, and, uh, and Dave, uh, well, Dave had, what, his interest, uh, in, in this, uh, till, and he, and, uh, and, of course, he feels always deferred to Dave Kirshenov.

27:02.992 --> 27:09.180
So, so, uh, when Dave was the host, we'd have to meet, uh, we'd meet at this restaurant.

27:10.342 --> 27:11.323
And when, uh,

27:12.957 --> 27:18.786
Of course, if Fales was the host, we'd meet at the Players Club in Gramercy Park, because he was a member.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.268
He was very proud of that membership.

27:21.610 --> 27:23.573
Yeah, and we'd meet there.

27:24.614 --> 27:28.540
And, you know, this really would kill my ass, you know.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.723
How did you figure getting to invite him?

27:30.743 --> 27:32.245
Why did you have to be there?

27:32.365 --> 27:34.529
Because I was the curator of the Fales Collection.

27:35.370 --> 27:37.974
I mean, why did you have to be at the lunch for two days a week?

27:38.234 --> 27:42.340
Well, because they wanted to talk about what was happening with the Fales Collection.

27:42.775 --> 27:54.152
What I was doing, what we had cataloged, was there anything I wanted to buy, and so on and so on.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.755
Just talk.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.357
How did you judge David?

27:57.377 --> 28:02.124
I have really no way of judging him at all.

28:02.164 --> 28:08.614
I never really knew him as a bookman, as a dealer.

28:09.168 --> 28:34.382
no he doesn't he doesn't there were all sorts of rumors about it but i'm i i never i don't know i don't know i don't know we that's all i know yeah that he was not a member of the association but and that he wasn't because there something had transpired at some point or another

28:34.852 --> 28:40.518
But I never had any business dealings with him whatsoever.

28:41.800 --> 29:01.062
But his, and there have been a number of instances of dealers who had this special relationship with, I mean, who is the,

29:01.615 --> 29:07.982
The great collection of literature that's down at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

29:08.002 --> 29:18.553
Oh, I can't think of that wonderful man, who never did anything without consulting John Cone or Mike Papantonio at Seven Gables.

29:18.593 --> 29:24.299
Papantonio's miniature books there and Worcester, yeah.

29:24.499 --> 29:25.340
That kind of thing.

29:25.740 --> 29:27.522
I've always found that very interesting.

29:28.328 --> 29:31.032
Well, that's the great satisfaction that .

29:31.252 --> 29:49.678
And it sounded, in its own way, to jump back, maybe one reason that you become disinterested in your own collection is that you get a real kick out of getting these extraordinary things from the getting.

29:50.063 --> 30:07.388
I still buy, I still buy, uh, something occasionally, I mean, a beautiful, something that, that, but, but I don't, you know, I'm not collecting in, uh, classical, uh, traditional sense anymore.

30:07.428 --> 30:10.873
I'll buy something that, uh, that interests me.

30:12.055 --> 30:17.843
Uh, I, uh, I saw a beautiful book, uh,

30:18.380 --> 30:20.723
a year or so ago of Gunnar Kaldavar.

30:20.743 --> 30:29.634
He's an artist and a printer and publisher, and I had an opportunity to see a spectacular copy of one of his books.

30:31.697 --> 30:40.708
I paid a hell of a lot more money than I really should pay for such a thing, but it was just so bright, and I just knew this was for me, so I bought it.

30:41.810 --> 30:46.075
Then I still have one of the great collections of the Cummington Press.

30:46.308 --> 30:48.470
I have a lot of press books.

30:49.331 --> 31:00.662
I have a lot of, and I know Harry Duncan quite well, and I have a really remarkable collection of the coming-to-the-press material, and all the offshoots of the coming-to-the-press.

31:01.763 --> 31:15.657
And then years and years ago, I, during particularly, during the 50s and the 60s, I decided that I was going to collect

31:16.126 --> 31:17.788
the poetry of my time.

31:18.389 --> 31:32.866
So my collection of a lot of interesting people, I mean, my collection of the Jargon Society is excellent, for example.

31:33.186 --> 31:40.094
My collection of things having to do with the Black Mountain College is very strong.

31:40.515 --> 31:42.157
Why the Black Mountain College?

31:42.337 --> 31:45.981
Well, it was where the jargon

31:46.298 --> 31:49.502
society was born, for that matter.

31:50.103 --> 32:00.578
But I think it represented one of the brief, and unfortunately too brief, high points in American education.

32:02.600 --> 32:10.131
Very European in flavor, very interdisciplinary, multicultural kinds of things.

32:10.151 --> 32:11.833
So I've collected a lot of

32:12.218 --> 32:26.571
The poetry and the art, it has come out of that, and so that my collections of the work of people like Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, Zukovsky, people of that made are very good.

32:27.452 --> 32:32.677
All the, all, I have, excuse me, these are all books now, these aren't manuscripts now.

32:32.777 --> 32:38.703
Oh, I have a few manuscripts and pieces too, books and journals, books and magazines.

32:38.723 --> 32:39.964
I love little magazines.

32:40.788 --> 32:46.754
And I used to have a great deal more than I have now, because I've sold off bits and pieces.

32:48.015 --> 32:53.500
But I still have quite a nice collection of little magazines.

32:53.520 --> 32:59.006
But just, and I'll end with that, but do you get the satisfaction of buying for the games?

32:59.026 --> 32:59.266
Yes.

32:59.747 --> 33:03.590
As I say, I buy only occasionally for myself.

33:03.610 --> 33:07.334
And you do get personal satisfaction for buying things?

33:07.354 --> 33:07.995
Oh, absolutely.

33:08.035 --> 33:08.435
Every day.

33:09.116 --> 33:10.457
Every day.

33:11.365 --> 33:21.637
In my personal life, you know, I've reached a point where the fewer possessions that I have, the happier I am.

33:23.759 --> 33:25.862
I think everybody comes to this at some point.

33:26.943 --> 33:31.568
I just don't want the responsibility anymore.

33:31.588 --> 33:34.612
I don't want to take care of all of this stuff.

33:34.672 --> 33:39.237
One of the films I interviewed, apparently, in a big man.

33:40.058 --> 33:40.779
Have you ever heard of it?

33:41.059 --> 33:41.119
No.

33:48.608 --> 33:54.393
that he still never leaves the house without somebody where he's a bit of a collection going to leave.

33:54.413 --> 33:54.734
Yeah.

33:55.174 --> 33:57.476
But you get two rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Life.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.878
Yeah, no, that's wonderful.

33:59.278 --> 34:01.320
But I'm not in that class.

34:01.360 --> 34:09.288
But I just don't, you know, after all, I'm not a kid anymore.

34:09.508 --> 34:17.215
And my wife and I like the freedom of our children growing up in a way.

34:17.667 --> 34:22.314
We like the freedom of doing what we want to do now with them.

34:22.334 --> 34:25.399
Do any of the children share the same passion?

34:25.419 --> 34:31.428
Well, I wouldn't say passion, but I'm happy to say that both of them are readers.

34:32.630 --> 34:43.506
Not one of them in particular, but one in particular is a great reader and interested in ideas, interested in, you know, loves music.

34:44.752 --> 34:48.196
I guess I can ask you one more question.

34:55.705 --> 35:06.238
I want to ask you, first of all, very briefly, I'm sure you have a major conservation program.

35:07.279 --> 35:07.980
Yes and no.

35:11.324 --> 35:14.067
Because we are in this building,

35:15.076 --> 35:18.379
only for a few years.

35:18.839 --> 35:27.087
When we move up there on the hill in Brentwood, we will have our own very nice.

35:27.987 --> 35:40.638
At the moment, because of space, we do one of three things.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.762
We use the museum's facility.

35:46.379 --> 35:52.727
We use the Getty Conservation Institute's facility, or we go out privately.

35:53.888 --> 36:00.056
And then just the size of your staff.

36:00.076 --> 36:03.641
For me personally, in collection development.

36:05.263 --> 36:13.433
Well, that's a very interesting question, because I can't answer it simply for this reason.

36:14.122 --> 36:23.774
And I don't want to answer simply for this reason, because it concerns the philosophy of this place.

36:23.814 --> 36:26.378
It's something which makes it unusual.

36:30.363 --> 36:43.740
It's my belief, and one that I'm happy to share it by my colleagues and the director, that

36:44.294 --> 36:58.146
The kind of institution that is strictly compartmentalized, where everybody does just this and nothing else, is not the kind of place we want to be.

36:58.466 --> 37:13.879
We want to be the kind of place where everybody who has the ability to make an impact, to share an idea,

37:14.365 --> 37:20.553
and share information has the opportunity to do that.

37:20.573 --> 37:28.864
So that it's a very collegial kind of atmosphere that we try to encourage here.

37:29.806 --> 37:43.444
So that if we have people who have a significant subject expertise who but are not themselves

37:43.812 --> 37:47.558
in the collection development division.

37:50.122 --> 37:55.791
We don't want that talent, that ability, wasted.

37:55.831 --> 38:11.676
Those people, a formal arrangement is instituted so that those people are brought in to the discussions and the decision-making processes

38:12.230 --> 38:18.877
and have something to say about those areas in which they are expert.

38:18.897 --> 38:30.450
For example, we have a cataloger in the library who is a Russian expert.

38:30.470 --> 38:42.102
Not only is he a Russian expert, but he's an expert on the very aspects of Russian art, philosophy, literature,

38:42.419 --> 38:48.808
that we are particularly interested in, namely the early 20th century.

38:49.670 --> 38:53.255
He's a bona fide scholar in these areas.

38:54.296 --> 39:06.454
But his job when he came here was as a run-of-the-mill routine cataloger, not even a rare book cataloger.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.300
Well, he discovered this

39:11.208 --> 39:13.712
this talent and interest in this part.

39:14.994 --> 39:16.977
And we see to it.

39:17.097 --> 39:20.322
I mean, one twentieth, one fifth.

39:21.443 --> 39:37.367
One day out of every five is spent, although he reports primarily to somebody else, in cataloging whatever is put in front of him, like cataloging is his primary responsibility.

39:39.170 --> 39:39.831
I, as

39:40.283 --> 39:58.241
the person in charge of collection development, and knowing that these are areas of particular significance for us, have one-fifth of his time for collection development purposes.

39:58.982 --> 40:05.628
And this is true throughout the institution.

40:07.270 --> 40:09.312
So I have a body of people.

40:09.950 --> 40:12.592
Yeah, I'm going to tell you.

40:12.612 --> 40:15.054
I've got to count them up.

40:15.074 --> 40:16.235
I have a body of people.

40:16.496 --> 40:21.060
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

40:21.080 --> 40:21.940
I have about ten.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.382
I was going to say ten.

40:23.402 --> 40:28.906
Yeah, I have about ten who work full-time for me.

40:30.248 --> 40:38.775
But in addition, I have a large number of other people to draw from.

40:39.160 --> 40:39.841
And I do.

40:40.361 --> 40:47.269
So that my ten, you know, I have to be very close supervision of them.

40:48.451 --> 40:52.675
They are responsible to me, you know.

40:52.695 --> 40:55.979
I'm their supervisor.

40:57.140 --> 41:03.868
However, as far as collection development work is concerned, all of these others are also responsible to me.

41:04.675 --> 41:25.566
And when their supervisor, their principal supervisor, comes at the end of the year to write their performance evaluations and that kind of thing, I write a little addendum, a little codicil, you see, concerning their work for me.

41:25.586 --> 41:30.833
And one other question.

41:30.873 --> 41:33.417
When we were talking about

41:34.308 --> 41:46.785
I hesitate to use the word aggressive, but doing more in collection development than any other institution.

41:46.805 --> 41:55.176
I wonder if you see any kind of parallel between what you're doing now and say with Texas State for 20 to 30 years.

41:55.216 --> 41:57.379
You're not taking into account the means of acquisition.

41:58.034 --> 42:16.843
I really don't know how to answer that question.

42:17.744 --> 42:26.117
One, because, I mean, we all heard of Texas and the great collections and how they were added, but I'm not

42:28.257 --> 42:38.290
I'm really, I don't know myself, I don't know, you know, or read about it, the reasons for this, I mean, what they wanted to do with this kind of stuff.

42:38.370 --> 42:40.973
I wanted to build a digital tech national in about 15 years.

42:41.153 --> 42:43.416
Ah, but you see, then that's not what we want.

42:44.998 --> 42:46.200
That's not what we want.

42:46.260 --> 42:50.145
He actually said that, he wanted to build a digital tech national in Austin, Texas.

42:50.165 --> 42:53.128
Ah, no, well then that is not what we want at all.

42:53.208 --> 42:56.813
We are not interested in everything.

42:57.552 --> 43:16.368
We are not interested in quantity, and we are not interested in a letter, for example, a manuscript, which is already published, you see.

43:17.169 --> 43:17.970
Which has been published.

43:17.990 --> 43:19.711
Which has been published.

43:20.012 --> 43:20.552
We are not.

43:20.852 --> 43:22.073
Neither are they.

43:22.094 --> 43:25.957
They have a rule, in fact, that they won't buy it.

43:25.977 --> 43:27.238
Yeah, but they bought all of those.

43:27.657 --> 43:34.827
Writers, archives, manuscripts and stuff.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.970
We would not do that.

43:39.314 --> 43:42.779
We are interested in scholarship and research here.

43:43.780 --> 43:48.226
If a letter has been published, then fine.

43:48.246 --> 43:49.208
What if I'm a scholar?

43:49.228 --> 43:50.990
Can I copy a letter that you own?

43:51.010 --> 43:51.591
Of course you can.

43:51.631 --> 43:52.973
They will not allow you to do that.

43:53.341 --> 43:54.142
Did you know that?

43:54.162 --> 43:54.723
No, I didn't.

43:54.863 --> 43:55.564
But of course you can.

43:55.824 --> 43:58.707
No, our stuff is here to be used.

43:58.727 --> 44:02.692
I mean, naturally, if we don't have the copyright, you've got to check through.

44:02.732 --> 44:03.212
That kind of thing.

44:03.232 --> 44:03.653
That's right.

44:03.733 --> 44:04.814
Everything else is fine.

44:04.834 --> 44:05.075
Yeah.

44:05.695 --> 44:08.438
But, no, our stuff is here to be used.

44:08.599 --> 44:09.360
In fact, there's a story.

44:09.380 --> 44:13.705
Robert Graves' son was offered at the University of Texas.

44:13.725 --> 44:16.988
He had some of his father's letters, and they have a great... Yeah.

44:17.709 --> 44:21.053
And he would give them copies of what he had, and they wouldn't do it.

44:21.303 --> 44:44.205
really but so you see so our our uh our purpose is uh uh uh i mean we're not here to accumulate everything we're here to work very closely as i said before with other institutions particularly those in the same geographical area that we do but uh um

44:45.805 --> 45:14.260
I hesitate to say we're highly selective when it's true that we buy so much in so many areas, but in a sense we are highly selective because we're only interested in material that we think is worthwhile, will further scholarship and research in the history of art and artifacts and the ways that we want that kind of research to be done.

45:15.235 --> 45:17.760
One final question.

45:17.901 --> 45:27.360
Can you think of any one acquisition or two as well?

45:27.380 --> 45:30.627
Well, that's a tough one.

45:30.647 --> 45:32.451
Me too.

45:33.308 --> 45:36.191
Oh, we've had so many fantastic collections.

45:36.211 --> 45:47.863
Something that you've identified as a real thing was there, and everything that worked in what you've got is the crown, the jewel and the crown of the Getty.

45:47.963 --> 45:50.266
The jewel and the crown.

45:51.507 --> 45:53.309
Yeah, that's a tough one.

45:53.329 --> 46:03.079
It's like saying, you know, what's the most interesting book you've read recently, and your mind goes blank.

46:04.004 --> 46:06.828
There have been so many.

46:07.509 --> 46:08.971
And why only the Getty?

46:09.031 --> 46:10.393
I mean, I've acquired things.

46:11.013 --> 46:14.658
I've acquired things for every institution that at work.

46:15.379 --> 46:17.001
That's been the joy of it.

46:19.945 --> 46:26.174
If you think about it, I'll quiet it back.

46:26.194 --> 46:27.556
Yeah, right, yeah.

46:27.816 --> 46:29.158
I really don't know what I'm saying.

46:29.198 --> 46:30.359
There have been so many.

46:30.900 --> 46:33.083
And you know, it's also...

46:33.367 --> 46:44.683
I mean, the things that interest me now, the things that my mind is on are the ones that are working, that are in the stove.

46:46.585 --> 46:49.810
I think it's great, man.

46:49.950 --> 46:51.652
Yes, it is.

46:52.453 --> 46:55.277
Because that's what's fun.

46:55.317 --> 46:59.543
No, I'm proud of the ones that are here and elsewhere.

47:00.181 --> 47:04.767
There have been a few that haven't gotten away, too, of course, you know.

47:04.787 --> 47:05.889
Well, what's gotten away?

47:06.610 --> 47:08.092
Any big frustrations?

47:08.112 --> 47:15.041
Of course, I think the best story of frustration is the one you told me about it.

47:15.061 --> 47:16.443
Yeah, yeah.

47:16.603 --> 47:19.407
Not too bad we didn't get away.

47:19.427 --> 47:21.410
Not very kind of it.

47:21.430 --> 47:28.399
But, yeah, no, there have been a few frustrations that I haven't gotten, but all in all, it's

47:29.560 --> 47:30.061
It's been good.

47:30.081 --> 47:57.643
No, I'm very proud of the fact that I can look around, everywhere around the country, in L.C., New York, California, Washington, and I can see, in some cases, beautiful, in other cases, useful collections that have and can move.

47:57.893 --> 48:05.621
make a difference to people, make a difference to scholarship, to research.

48:06.542 --> 48:19.094
And I hope, especially to the young people who come around and look at something and think, gosh, I never thought of it that way before.

48:19.394 --> 48:20.896
Something like that.

48:20.916 --> 48:24.019
You were going to get me some things, some papers.
