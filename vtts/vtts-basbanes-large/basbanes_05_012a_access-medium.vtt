WEBVTT

00:03.592 --> 00:08.601
So tell me a little bit about animal vitality.

00:08.621 --> 00:09.743
Animal vitality.

00:09.804 --> 00:18.379
Well, this is a quality possessed in large measure by my, I wouldn't say hero, but... Air Pro 2L.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.303
Oh, something's coming through.

00:22.327 --> 00:26.815
Certainly it's a quality possessed in...

00:27.115 --> 00:31.823
in great quantity by the lover in my novel.

00:31.923 --> 00:33.325
Do we have quotes around the lover?

00:34.407 --> 00:37.031
I don't think we need quotes.

00:37.051 --> 00:52.296
I think this is a man who genuinely does love Stella, but of course he's a very disturbed man and suffers from morbid jealousy.

00:52.816 --> 00:58.987
paranoid psychosis that makes his relationships with women extremely difficult.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.391
Is it necessary that he be an artist?

01:03.474 --> 01:10.807
It's necessary for what I wanted to do in the novel.

01:11.388 --> 01:15.735
What I wanted to suggest was that here was a woman

01:16.424 --> 01:25.413
who is being defined for us by the psychiatrist into whose hands she falls later in the novel.

01:25.513 --> 01:29.337
And he is telling us what her experience means.

01:30.939 --> 01:43.191
And I wanted to contrast with the psychiatrist a madman who also wanted to tell us who Stella is and what she's really like.

01:43.981 --> 01:52.391
And so it was necessary that he be an artist in order he too be working on his version of Stella.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.234
So they're both artists in a sense.

01:54.394 --> 01:55.635
In a sense they both are.

01:55.675 --> 02:04.026
They're both attempting to give us a true representation of this rather enigmatic woman.

02:04.046 --> 02:05.708
And of course we both have different views.

02:05.768 --> 02:09.212
They both have different views.

02:10.171 --> 02:14.638
Are you familiar with Margaret Atwood's new novel, Alias Grace?

02:14.858 --> 02:15.559
I haven't read it.

02:16.060 --> 02:22.871
But you're aware, of course, that we also have an asylum as the central setting.

02:25.295 --> 02:33.968
Of course, in your fiction, it just seems to be the central metaphor, isn't it?

02:34.707 --> 02:35.908
In my fiction generally?

02:36.229 --> 02:37.530
Well, thus far.

02:38.711 --> 02:47.661
Well, yes, I seem to gravitate to forms of madness in almost all my books.

02:47.801 --> 03:01.255
I am very interested in what happens when the mind's ability to make proper sense of reality

03:02.298 --> 03:28.137
when that, uh, when that ability begins to, to, to crangle, um, and when reality no longer conforms to, to a character's, uh, attempt to, to give it some sort of order and shape, um, and how people then, um, you know, flail about and, and, um,

03:28.724 --> 03:37.180
make peculiar mental arrangements with themselves and with the outside world in order to try and sustain some sort of sense of order in the world.

03:38.142 --> 03:44.674
And that's been a persistent

03:45.363 --> 03:48.348
theme, the central theme of mine.

03:48.368 --> 03:55.118
You know, I'm out in Worcester, where we have, I think, the first insane asylum in the United States.

03:56.981 --> 04:01.628
It's a very famous, and of course, that's what it was called, an insane asylum.

04:02.910 --> 04:07.697
And we have all kinds of different concepts of what mental illness is today, don't we?

04:08.178 --> 04:11.663
Which I guess is why you picked a specific time for the setting of this.

04:12.204 --> 04:14.087
That was...

04:14.337 --> 04:25.712
More because I wanted the woman's position in society to be more constricted than perhaps it would be today.

04:25.772 --> 04:39.449
I wanted Stella to be somewhat trapped in her rather loveless marriage and to be very limited in the sort of resources she had for finding a better life.

04:39.990 --> 04:43.855
So I thought if I just pitch it back in 59...

04:44.763 --> 04:55.093
that is a moment at which it would be very difficult to say, well, why didn't she get a life, get a job, take a lover, move to London?

04:55.614 --> 04:57.455
Things would have been much more difficult for a woman.

04:58.636 --> 05:08.046
But also I think attitudes of what mental illness is and was and how it's treated, they have changed, don't you think?

05:08.226 --> 05:09.307
Yeah, very much so.

05:09.567 --> 05:14.652
I wonder if this guy would be a trustee today, for instance.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.456
It's doubtful.

05:17.516 --> 05:34.499
He may well be incarcerated today, as he was then, but I think certainly at that time, there was only one real response to the mentally ill, which was to put him in those big Victorian institutions and lock the door.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.283
Would he be far more heavily medicated today, do you think?

05:39.226 --> 05:43.592
Do you know, I think he would present a real problem to...

05:44.078 --> 05:55.714
psychiatry today because he was a man who was basically functioning normally or above normal in almost every area of his life.

05:56.095 --> 06:04.767
It was only when he became involved with a woman that the trouble began.

06:05.228 --> 06:07.952
It's like the alcoholic I met for a drink, isn't it?

06:08.292 --> 06:09.193
Yeah, yeah.

06:09.674 --> 06:12.398
And so, I mean...

06:12.884 --> 06:16.533
It would be very difficult to allow this man to go back on the street.

06:16.573 --> 06:19.902
You'd need to be keeping a very, very close eye on him, I think.

06:21.005 --> 06:29.847
And the minute that he did begin to form a relationship with a woman, you'd, you know, certainly a lot of alarm would have to go off.

06:30.130 --> 06:43.762
Now, when you started thinking about this particular novel, I know certainly something about the fact that I guess you have a history, a personal history of growing up in such a place.

06:43.822 --> 06:44.903
Is that correct?

06:44.923 --> 06:46.185
Yeah, that's right.

06:48.106 --> 06:53.311
Rawmore is the biggest of the top security asylums in England.

06:53.391 --> 06:57.555
My father was appointed medical superintendent in 1956.

06:58.210 --> 07:21.990
and my family lived there for the next 25 years very very close to the to the hospital itself wow so i grew up very much so how old were you during your years i was six years old then um and um you know my my parents were still there when i left home did you know any uh were they patients or inmates patients yep patients yeah the the uh

07:22.375 --> 07:31.751
By this point, it had become a hospital rather than an asylum, and the inmates were patients.

07:32.071 --> 07:36.479
So a medical model was employed.

07:38.502 --> 07:40.806
Is there any kind of a commentary here on your part?

07:41.467 --> 07:45.735
Do you have an attitude on the Freudian approach at all?

07:45.795 --> 07:47.758
I wonder...

07:49.038 --> 07:57.426
Out of attitudes in the profession, I would expect they would be dramatically different, you know, in 59 than they might be today.

07:57.666 --> 08:11.840
And I'm wondering, you know, if you weigh in at all on this particular... I don't know that I weigh in particularly on, you know, psychiatric paradigms.

08:11.920 --> 08:18.707
I've always found Freud to be very useful, very suggestive.

08:19.177 --> 08:21.280
as a writer on the mind.

08:22.182 --> 08:30.895
I'm not sure that I have a little axe to grind in terms of different forms of psychiatric treatment.

08:30.955 --> 08:37.084
What I did want to get at in this book was to point out that psychiatrists carry

08:37.385 --> 08:41.751
real social power and... Real what kind of power, sorry?

08:41.771 --> 08:42.352
Social power.

08:42.372 --> 08:42.953
Social power.

08:42.993 --> 08:54.990
They're able to control how we, how other people are defined, how they're categorized, how they're diagnosed, and whether or not they should be allowed to have their freedom or not.

08:55.551 --> 09:00.918
So a psychiatrist has, within his power, the ability to rob somebody of their liberty.

09:01.218 --> 09:07.307
And I wanted to say that while we...

09:07.456 --> 09:11.602
We will trust that psychiatrists don't abuse this power.

09:11.622 --> 09:13.564
We can't be certain that they don't abuse it.

09:13.584 --> 09:18.992
And we must beware of any profession that has this power at their disposal.

09:19.412 --> 09:27.123
But, of course, when you think of a criminally insane and whether you're robbing somebody of their freedom, I mean, you're a murderer, after all.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.168
I mean... Well, it's true.

09:31.857 --> 09:36.743
And your narrator is even thinking after five years, well, maybe he can go home now.

09:36.903 --> 09:38.145
Well, let's give him another five.

09:39.727 --> 09:43.712
There's always, I think, a question.

09:45.975 --> 09:49.879
If I keep this man locked up, then the public is protected from him.

09:50.841 --> 09:55.987
But is there a point at which it's simply cruel to keep a man locked up?

09:57.769 --> 10:01.594
Don't we want some sort of...

10:03.160 --> 10:16.985
Psychiatric policy whereby we can allow people to return to real life, to life in society before they become institutionalized, before it becomes too late for them ever to return to society.

10:17.265 --> 10:22.114
And isn't there always some risk involved in society?

10:22.516 --> 10:27.923
allowing somebody who has been violent while insane.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.668
Look at this case that's just in the news today and yesterday, this fellow in California.

10:33.229 --> 10:34.531
Have you been following the news?

10:34.551 --> 10:39.857
Well, I'm on the road, so I've been... This fellow who was a rapist and cut off a woman's arms, right?

10:40.378 --> 10:46.545
No, I haven't... And they released him after eight years, and they just arrested him in Florida, and he did the same thing.

10:47.907 --> 10:48.608
I mean, it's...

10:48.588 --> 10:55.135
I mean, you could argue, you know, the guy should never be let out again.

10:55.155 --> 11:08.268
Or you might argue, you know, that what broke down here was sort of surveillance that he should have been under, you know, after he'd been released.

11:08.769 --> 11:13.093
Or he should have been released maybe to a medium security institution.

11:13.900 --> 11:19.347
You know, it's some of the reviews that I've read that suggested that you write these Gothic novels.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.127
Do you agree with that?

11:20.828 --> 11:22.330
I think so.

11:22.370 --> 11:27.817
I mean, as I said to you, I'm most interested in forms of madness.

11:28.177 --> 11:32.482
And I think, you know, that's certainly a Gothic theme.

11:33.403 --> 11:39.571
And I'm very fond of Gothic fiction, so I don't have any problem with that label.

11:39.591 --> 11:41.393
In fact, you know, I'm...

11:41.693 --> 11:51.589
I'd be proud to be put in a tradition that includes people like Oscar Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Emily Brontë.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.214
It's a distinguished... Sure is.

11:54.234 --> 11:55.856
Well, is it a genre in your view?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.679
I'd say so.

11:57.719 --> 12:04.130
And if so, then are there various conventions that one must abide?

12:06.253 --> 12:07.195
I'd say that

12:07.900 --> 12:25.063
What tends always to be foregrounded in Gothic fiction are a small group of themes, and I'd call those, I'd say that those are transgression, decay, and the double.

12:25.083 --> 12:29.689
I'd say that work that counts as Gothic will

12:30.226 --> 12:35.713
have at its sort of thematic center one or all of those ideas.

12:35.773 --> 12:38.416
That's what Gothic fiction is interested in.

12:38.436 --> 12:55.677
Are you interested in either deeper human truths here that one is probing, or are we looking at the, is this kind of like a Frankenstein monster kind of a thing where we're looking, or Jekyll and Hyde type of a thing where we're...

12:56.720 --> 12:59.885
Are we looking at level, you know, you know what I'm saying here.

12:59.905 --> 13:23.841
In the Gothic in general, I think what we're able to do is to explore those darker, more extreme areas of human experience, human consciousness, that we tend not to want to probe too deeply at.

13:24.378 --> 13:44.850
And the Gothic is, you know, tends to be rather sort of unafraid of going into the unconscious, discovering, you know, the darker impulses, you know, what Freud would call them the id, you know.

13:45.860 --> 13:49.009
the Gothic is interested in sort of dream symbolism.

13:49.069 --> 13:58.958
I'd say the Gothic takes the unconscious, you know, seriously and wants to demonstrate how it sort of permeates through into daily life.

13:59.697 --> 14:01.920
Now, this is about four, I think, for you.

14:01.940 --> 14:02.401
Is that right?

14:02.541 --> 14:03.322
This is number five.

14:03.362 --> 14:04.403
This is number five.

14:04.583 --> 14:05.585
Yeah.

14:05.605 --> 14:11.793
And maybe if you could describe the creative process here.

14:12.254 --> 14:14.396
Do we start with Stella?

14:14.416 --> 14:15.518
Do we start with a theme?

14:15.918 --> 14:18.161
Do you start with the narrator being a doctor?

14:18.221 --> 14:19.143
I'm just curious.

14:20.945 --> 14:26.312
My process has...

14:27.052 --> 14:29.876
is generally to start off with a story.

14:30.457 --> 14:54.814
And in this case, the story started with simply the idea of a love triangle, but not an ordinary love triangle, one that has at its center psychiatrist's wife, Stella, and then the lover as the patient, the artist, and the husband as the doctor, the psychiatrist,

14:55.081 --> 15:08.319
so that the tension between husband and lover is much more intense and pronounced than it is in your standard love triangle.

15:08.339 --> 15:18.273
And with that idea, a story immediately began to unravel in my imagination.

15:18.714 --> 15:23.080
And so I scribbled it down, wrote a first draft,

15:23.735 --> 15:28.120
And then this again is something I've learned to do now.

15:29.161 --> 15:40.795
When I get a second draft, I choose one of the characters and give that character the job of narrating the story.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.758
Well, in this case, was the narrator part of the story?

15:44.319 --> 15:47.102
He was very peripheral to the story in the first draft.

15:47.663 --> 15:53.269
He was just one of the psychiatrists that worked in the hospital.

15:53.671 --> 16:04.811
And then when I'd written the whole thing out, I began to see the possibilities of giving Peter Cleave the job of narrating the story.

16:05.251 --> 16:08.818
And I began to see what I could make of that.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.285
And did you see him taking on a stronger role at that point, too?

16:14.047 --> 16:14.387
Yes.

16:15.089 --> 16:17.653
Although I wanted to...

16:18.359 --> 16:38.797
first of all, give the reader the sense that this man was reliable, was telling the truth, was compassionate, wise, a sound professional who understood the people he was dealing with, and then very slowly sow seeds of doubt as to this man's reliability.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.780
Do you see anything cathartic here at all?

16:42.880 --> 16:48.045
Or is it mainly... I'm not sure, but...

16:48.413 --> 17:08.676
I think there's something cathartic in the sense that Stella is a woman who doesn't turn back, who sort of keeps on, you know, who goes regardless of everything that she loses along the way.

17:10.278 --> 17:17.847
She doesn't ever doubt that, you know, she is right to...

17:18.130 --> 17:47.631
give priority to this I mean she has no choice she feels her heart leads her on and even where it's clear that she's going to lose everything in the process it's going to cost her everything this love affair she still doesn't hesitate at all and of course she pays the ultimate price for this and I think there's something cathartic there if you do sort of identify and sell her and then say you know

17:48.016 --> 17:49.177
Yes, it doesn't matter.

17:49.237 --> 17:51.019
The world is well lost for love.

17:52.180 --> 17:55.624
There is this sort of cathartic outcome.

17:55.644 --> 17:58.026
What were some of the other narrative possibilities?

17:58.827 --> 18:02.791
The first draft was written from Stella's point of view.

18:02.811 --> 18:05.434
And I thought for a long time that I might leave it.

18:05.935 --> 18:09.138
You know, I might give her her own story.

18:10.679 --> 18:16.065
It had occurred to me that her husband could tell the story, even that her son could tell the story.

18:16.332 --> 18:23.540
but somehow Peter Klee's, you know, claim upon this story was the strongest.

18:23.560 --> 18:41.080
I mean, there's the degree of detachment on the one hand, and yet the professional and the knowledge of the characters, too, I suppose, that gives... Of course, I read something that you're working on a novel about a giant now, I guess.

18:42.401 --> 18:45.765
Yeah, it's an 18th century novel about...

18:46.488 --> 18:56.643
A doctor in London who becomes obsessed with a giant that is showing himself in taverns around the town.

18:57.845 --> 19:04.976
And the doctor begins to sort of lust after the giant's bones.

19:04.996 --> 19:09.963
He wants his skeleton, a museum of anatomy.

19:09.983 --> 19:15.111
And so he has this very peculiar relationship by this rather pathetic...

19:15.580 --> 19:26.852
deformed creature, the giant, and a doctor who's probably not unlike Peter Cleave, a rather cold and obsessive sort of man.

19:28.374 --> 19:32.358
But I'm really, you know, it's early days for that one.

19:32.899 --> 19:35.161
Are you a visual writer?

19:35.241 --> 19:36.322
I mean, do you see these things?

19:36.883 --> 19:38.184
I do like to see them.

19:39.186 --> 19:44.271
And I feel that I ought to, you know, show the reader what things look like.

19:44.605 --> 19:51.174
So I do tend to do a lot of research and try and imagine as visually as possible.

19:51.795 --> 19:54.558
I mean, there is a cinematic quality to it, I think, as well.

19:54.759 --> 20:00.366
I don't think it would be that hard to transform these stories into films.

20:00.386 --> 20:09.558
And I guess one of them is, in fact, being... Yeah, the first novel, The Grotesque, was filmed and is opening in early March.

20:09.759 --> 20:11.541
And did you write the screenplay for that?

20:11.601 --> 20:11.821
Yes.

20:12.622 --> 20:14.545
And that's quite an interesting exercise, isn't it?

20:14.828 --> 20:23.300
It was very tricky with this particular novel because it's narrated by a man who's paralyzed in a wheelchair.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.902
He's a vegetable, everybody thinks.

20:25.382 --> 20:27.886
So the whole novel basically takes place in his head.

20:28.647 --> 20:32.112
And this, of course, is not very cinematic.

20:32.132 --> 20:40.363
So I had to basically sort of take it out of his head and organize a chronological timeline.

20:41.305 --> 20:44.150
I'm not going to ask you about the biographical details.

20:44.231 --> 20:44.792
I have that.

20:44.812 --> 20:47.076
I'm sure that hasn't changed from what I've read.

20:47.096 --> 20:48.899
No, I shouldn't think so.

20:49.961 --> 20:53.248
So there is a lot of background information I have to draw.

20:53.268 --> 20:54.971
And I think I've got some pretty good quotes here.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.636
So I think I'll let you go have your dinner.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.499
Well, thank you very much.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.423
And I appreciate the chat.

21:01.403 --> 21:03.108
Listen, my great pleasure.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.097
I appreciate that you, you know, take it.

21:06.157 --> 21:10.349
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't get into town to see you, but I'm sure there'll be another opportunity.

21:10.489 --> 21:11.252
I hope so.

21:11.452 --> 21:11.673
Great.

21:11.793 --> 21:12.435
Well, good luck.

21:12.696 --> 21:13.839
Thank you very much indeed.

21:13.919 --> 21:14.601
Nice talking to you.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.002
Me too.

21:15.023 --> 21:15.323
Good night.

21:15.584 --> 21:15.885
Bye-bye.
