WEBVTT

00:03.676 --> 00:04.157
All right.

00:04.437 --> 00:05.058
What's your name again?

00:05.338 --> 00:05.798
Nick.

00:05.819 --> 00:06.239
Nicholas.

00:06.259 --> 00:06.920
Nick.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.842
I got you.

00:08.862 --> 00:09.763
From Worcester.

00:10.264 --> 00:10.764
Yes, sir.

00:11.065 --> 00:13.167
We're on Channel 27 over there.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.208
Oh, where are you on 27?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.009
There don't be years.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.112
You're going out to Worcester?

00:17.132 --> 00:17.532
No, sir.

00:17.592 --> 00:18.714
Getting all the way back home.

00:18.734 --> 00:21.217
Oh, I was going to say, you said you were on 27?

00:21.237 --> 00:22.858
We've been on 30 years.

00:22.878 --> 00:23.800
Oh, sure, yeah.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.142
Oh, they still pay.

00:26.863 --> 00:30.207
I'll have a cheesecake with a fresh blueberry sauce and an ice cream.

00:33.258 --> 00:38.966
Okay, I guess you are a phenomenon of the last 10 years, I would say.

00:39.187 --> 00:44.074
I mean, you've been around, but certainly as a national presence.

00:44.094 --> 00:45.236
Does that surprise you?

00:45.296 --> 00:47.659
Did you ever expect you to divorce?

00:47.679 --> 00:49.562
Well, no, I did not.

00:51.184 --> 01:03.062
Upon completion of my studies at Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, in 1956, at age 22, I came back to my hometown, Lynchburg, Virginia.

01:04.392 --> 01:09.419
And with 35 persons, started, founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church.

01:10.860 --> 01:21.714
My dreams were, in that little city of 63,000 population, to one day have a church of 500 people and preach to them every Sunday for the rest of my life.

01:21.775 --> 01:22.716
Those were my goals.

01:24.578 --> 01:26.280
What happened?

01:26.300 --> 01:31.908
Well, I started on... Pardon me for asking what seems obvious, but... Yes.

01:31.928 --> 01:33.690
Because a lot of this is in the book.

01:34.261 --> 01:38.786
But I'm just curious, you know, how did you become such a force?

01:39.407 --> 01:47.435
I had been converted to Jesus Christ through a radio broadcast while a college student.

01:48.176 --> 01:53.722
Dr. Charles E. Fuller was the preacher from Long Beach Municipal Autorium, Long Beach, California.

01:53.782 --> 01:59.028
Every Sunday I heard him on the radio.

01:59.368 --> 02:02.732
So when I started Thomas Road Baptist Church in 1956,

02:03.893 --> 02:12.306
I purchased time on the local radio station, 6.30 to 7 every morning, seven days a week, and live.

02:14.990 --> 02:31.234
I would drive from my home to the radio station to that half-hour broadcast, go from there to the Thomaswood Baptist Church, which was really a little 50-foot by 30-foot building, the old Donald Duck Bottling Company building that had gone, they'd gone busty.

02:32.277 --> 02:37.943
I'm curious, pardon me for interrupting, but I noticed that John Olbeck bought one company in the book.

02:37.963 --> 02:42.147
Did they have to get a permission from Disney to use that name?

02:42.227 --> 02:43.709
I have an idea they must have.

02:43.749 --> 02:49.535
You know, this was way back when they were trying to launch a national soda, new soda, and it didn't work.

02:50.276 --> 02:52.078
I suspect, oh, I'm sure they had to.

02:52.118 --> 02:54.120
Because under Disney is quite... Oh, they own that.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.024
...justly jealous of... Oh, I'm sure they had to.

02:58.064 --> 03:00.006
That was a national thing with a local franchise.

03:01.150 --> 03:20.427
But that was by, I started radio then, and later that same year, 1956, started on television a half hour every Sunday afternoon, 5.30 to 6 p.m., live, black and white, one and two cameras, depending on if both cameras were healthy or not.

03:21.528 --> 03:28.795
And the idea of just reaching my local area, I learned through Fuller's radio broadcast that

03:29.602 --> 03:31.925
that you can reach people who are not going to church.

03:33.646 --> 03:40.774
And that I believe there are a lot of Jerry Falwells out there who are not going to attend church, whom I could reach through television and radio.

03:41.035 --> 03:43.397
And I was thinking of reaching the local area only.

03:44.338 --> 03:48.863
To answer the question, how did it happen, the radio and TV became very popular.

03:50.625 --> 03:53.128
And just by osmosis, we began adding stations.

03:53.869 --> 03:57.853
By 1971, 15 years later, we were national.

03:59.167 --> 04:02.850
And by 1979, we had formed the moral majority.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.212
It seems longer than 79.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.234
I remember you putting that out in the book.

04:07.795 --> 04:10.817
Well, I know.

04:11.558 --> 04:13.660
But moral majority was born in June of 79.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.083
It almost paralleled the rise of Ronald Reagan, didn't you say?

04:17.103 --> 04:19.605
About the same time and about over the same period of time.

04:20.246 --> 04:22.868
You know, I was in Virginia and he was in California.

04:23.909 --> 04:28.093
I was doing my work in a little state, a little state of Virginia.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.261
A religious work.

04:30.281 --> 04:32.243
He was doing a political work in California.

04:33.545 --> 04:36.187
And we both hit Washington about the same time.

04:38.330 --> 04:48.521
Do you see significance in the fact that you both seem to have... Well, we certainly had no connections before his quest for the presidency.

04:48.541 --> 04:51.724
I supported him in 76, and we lost.

04:53.486 --> 04:54.707
But I support him from a distance.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.490
In 1980, by that time,

04:59.208 --> 05:04.815
I was convinced Ronald Reagan must be the next president of the United States.

05:04.835 --> 05:07.217
A lot of others were so convinced, of course, as well.

05:08.779 --> 05:14.946
I met him for the first time when he was on the campaign trail in New Orleans.

05:16.688 --> 05:28.422
I remember flying in there, meeting with him, riding from the airport to the convention center with him in the back of the limo, talking about his dreams and his goals

05:28.891 --> 05:31.435
His philosophy.

05:31.455 --> 05:33.598
Totally synchronized what we were trying to do.

05:33.818 --> 05:38.805
I pledged to him our total support.

05:38.825 --> 05:41.589
We were at the time organizing all over America.

05:42.751 --> 05:46.276
Pastors and evangelical churches into voting blocks.

05:47.177 --> 05:48.118
Registering voters.

05:49.981 --> 05:53.426
And it was a movement whose time had come.

05:54.147 --> 05:57.632
Our people, conservative, religious conservatives have been

05:58.439 --> 06:02.345
virtually inactive for a long, long time.

06:02.606 --> 06:06.672
Do you think a lot of this might have to do with the traditional separation of church and state?

06:06.692 --> 06:13.162
I mean, this is an issue I'd like to discuss because you certainly aren't very influential politically.

06:13.183 --> 06:21.997
And, you know, a lot of people have reservations about the influence of the church on political destiny.

06:22.017 --> 06:24.160
Perhaps you could just discuss that and maybe...

06:24.612 --> 06:30.999
The black church in the 50s became the launching pad for the civil rights movement.

06:31.019 --> 06:34.363
King was himself a Baptist preacher.

06:34.383 --> 06:37.626
Most of his co-laborers were Baptist preachers.

06:39.148 --> 06:43.112
The civil rights movement was successful because of black churches.

06:45.635 --> 06:53.944
But the evangelical church had pretty well held to the view that religion and politics don't mix.

06:54.869 --> 06:58.012
Politics is bad business, dirty business.

06:58.032 --> 06:59.133
Did you subscribe to that?

06:59.153 --> 06:59.954
I subscribed to that.

07:00.274 --> 07:08.862
And during the civil rights days, I challenged our people to work for civil rights, but don't march in the streets.

07:08.922 --> 07:10.864
Don't become activists.

07:10.884 --> 07:21.634
Let's not be a part of something that could promote violence or take us away from our primary task, which is preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.

07:21.694 --> 07:21.754
Uh,

07:21.920 --> 07:34.055
I printed a sermon in 1965 called Ministers and Marches, in which I challenged the pastors of the country to stay out of the streets.

07:34.856 --> 07:37.920
Why did you want them out of the streets?

07:37.940 --> 07:50.155
I felt our pastors should be preaching their convictions, praying for change, but not involved in politics and particularly in activist politics.

07:51.181 --> 07:57.007
I felt that that was demeaning to the gospel we preached.

07:57.027 --> 08:11.543
1973, I was already troubled by that time through the breakdown of the family and the country and the various problems, the drug problems, the various moral living arrangements, etc.

08:11.563 --> 08:19.632
1973, the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion on demand.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.154
I think that was, for me,

08:22.248 --> 08:38.352
This is the John Marion interview, a John Marion interview coming up.

08:43.520 --> 08:50.550
What follows is an interview with John Marion, the president

08:50.969 --> 08:56.676
of Sotheby's in North America and the chief auctioneer in Boston in November of 1989.

09:33.038 --> 09:34.119
That's where it starts.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.743
We're talking about personality.

09:37.624 --> 09:50.420
It may sound odd to you, but some people, for some people, buying at auction gives the same sort of satisfaction, if that's the right word, as gambling does.

09:50.440 --> 09:59.411
There are people who are habitual gamblers or people who get a lot of thrill out of the game, out of playing the game.

10:00.172 --> 10:02.775
And for many people, the...

10:03.025 --> 10:04.968
the thrill of bidding an auction.

10:04.988 --> 10:07.953
It is the thrill of acquiring, but it's also the thrill of playing.

10:08.895 --> 10:23.620
And I know a person, for example, who is a dealer today in furniture, who is a reformed gambler, a gambler's anonymous person, you know, who grossly gambler's anonymous meetings and all the rest.

10:24.221 --> 10:26.164
He became a dealer because he gets

10:26.768 --> 10:30.774
very much the same junk, he says, out of playing roulette as going to an auctioneary.

10:30.814 --> 10:32.096
Now he goes home with 12 chairs.

10:32.416 --> 10:39.907
You run across some collectors who say there's a dealer, for instance, up in Paul Richards, up in Templeton.

10:39.927 --> 10:41.069
Yeah, I know him.

10:41.089 --> 10:42.832
He buys a deal of auctions.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.796
He has two rooms named after him here at Boston University.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.759
They're basically things that he's acquired.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.305
Once acquired, he's not interested anymore.

10:52.325 --> 10:54.168
And I think Jerome Kern was the same way.

10:54.228 --> 10:56.151
I mean, it was the acquisition of the item.

10:56.317 --> 10:56.878
The Chase.

10:57.839 --> 10:59.000
That was so important.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.125
Well, in a way, Andy Warhol was that way.

11:03.585 --> 11:08.011
Andy Warhol would buy these things and many times not even unwrap them.

11:08.031 --> 11:09.973
So they were in the same boxes he bought them in.

11:10.053 --> 11:11.375
He wasn't a book collector, was he?

11:12.216 --> 11:13.637
No, they were not really books.

11:13.657 --> 11:16.340
Is Bill Cosby a book collector?

11:16.360 --> 11:16.941
Not to my knowledge.

11:16.961 --> 11:20.866
Somebody suggested that he might be wonderful.

11:20.906 --> 11:21.967
Not rare books, anyway.

11:22.007 --> 11:22.948
He'd be wonderful.

11:23.317 --> 11:25.820
And I'm looking for a little star quality, too.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.704
I want to try and talk to Larry McMurtry, for instance, who'd be very interesting.

11:29.724 --> 11:32.467
He's a writer who's also a dealer.

11:32.487 --> 11:35.931
He's written a Cadillac Jack is about a sculpt.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.795
You know, Paul Richards, I believe he's also a bottle collector.

11:39.815 --> 11:41.557
Yeah, he collects everything.

11:41.697 --> 11:44.560
I remember selling an auction and he came with all the bottle people.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.062
You know, it's a whole group.

11:46.082 --> 11:48.365
You know, they come in bands and everything.

11:48.385 --> 11:49.246
It's a very different group.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.388
But here he was right in the middle of it.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.290
You say one thing in your book, which I...

11:54.063 --> 11:56.046
My wife and I like, we can go out on antiques.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.590
This is the antique capital of the world, I think.

11:58.610 --> 11:59.571
That's right, yeah.

11:59.591 --> 12:00.152
Tremendously hard.

12:00.172 --> 12:03.697
You can't really go out and find things.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.140
And, you know, we have the bizarre thing.

12:05.200 --> 12:13.252
Not bizarre, but let's say my house is a unique melange, as I'm sure your place says, as I've read.

12:13.913 --> 12:18.840
But one thing I hadn't realized is that you can go shopping at South of East.

12:18.860 --> 12:18.960
Yeah.

12:18.980 --> 12:23.327
You can actually, it's not a question of going and spending $10,000 that you can't afford,

12:23.780 --> 12:26.483
or some splendidly useless land.

12:26.503 --> 12:37.856
But you can actually go and buy wonderful things with a minor provenance, shall we say, and if you want to look at it as an investment.

12:37.936 --> 12:40.859
But I mean, this is an alternative to going to the department store.

12:40.959 --> 12:41.720
It certainly is.

12:41.740 --> 12:45.204
Because that seems to be a message that you're going to see.

12:45.464 --> 12:51.711
And one of the good things about that is if you do it on a constant basis, you're exposing yourself to all the different collecting fields.

12:52.028 --> 12:56.214
Well, you're creating connoisseurship at that point.

12:56.414 --> 13:01.481
It makes it possible for you then to identify the various areas that are of interest to you.

13:01.501 --> 13:09.513
And it's only through exposing yourself to these things that you have a facility for them that you feel comfortable, you feel attracted to them.

13:09.553 --> 13:11.376
Develops taste, doesn't it?

13:11.516 --> 13:12.477
Yeah.

13:12.978 --> 13:17.044
And the end product of all of this is quality of life.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.128
That's what we're talking about because just as you

13:20.480 --> 13:50.183
gather things those things mean something personal to you when they're around your home you live with those things you can probably remember the way you acquired every single one of them they all have a story to them yeah i have a clock i grew up in a lowell industrial city right there and uh when i was a kid they were building a bridge and they were dredging the merrimack river and they pulled out all these crocks i'm happy to be walking by and i've got this which i thought was enormous you know it turns out to be a coil

13:51.698 --> 13:54.201
for it 15, 20 years later when I was in college.

13:55.583 --> 13:58.586
It has a PH Dunahue and Sun wines.

13:58.646 --> 13:59.788
I researched it.

13:59.808 --> 14:01.289
It was Patrick Henry Dunahue.

14:01.309 --> 14:04.333
It's just a clock that we might sell for 15 bucks.

14:05.074 --> 14:07.517
I would die if I watched that piece.

14:07.537 --> 14:09.339
This is a wonderful story.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.882
It's really a meaningful thing to you.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.505
I have a little thing I got off my aircraft carrier.

14:14.585 --> 14:15.967
I was a naval officer.

14:16.568 --> 14:18.550
I went through Newport, not unlike yourself.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.877
You know, little things from the ship.

14:22.839 --> 14:28.729
One of these pins that they attach the ship to, the aircraft to, before they launch it.

14:28.829 --> 14:32.676
It's junk, but they throw them over the side after they use.

14:32.696 --> 14:34.198
But, you know, that's nice.

14:34.299 --> 14:40.369
That's part of my, it's an artifact that kind of creates the substance of your life.

14:41.108 --> 14:42.530
I sit and sell to these.

14:42.550 --> 14:44.532
That's an enormous, extraordinary.

14:44.672 --> 14:47.595
That is the largest, is that the largest gallery?

14:47.935 --> 14:48.356
Oh, yeah.

14:48.376 --> 14:49.917
I think by a lot.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.398
In the world?

14:50.418 --> 14:50.638
Yeah.

14:50.658 --> 14:57.205
Because we can put in that room, for a big impression, so we can put 1,200 people in that room.

14:57.225 --> 14:58.146
That's a big one.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.510
I have in my notes, my book, by the way, will start, I think.

15:01.890 --> 15:03.432
It's perfect with that auction.

15:04.453 --> 15:08.517
And I've even got the opening line, the bidding open there, $500,000.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.336
and proceeded at $50,000.

15:10.356 --> 15:17.207
$50,000 is the exact sum that Henry Huntington paid for the Gutenberg Bible at the wholesale in 1911.

15:18.129 --> 15:22.456
Huntington came from California and sat at the elbow of George Smith, his dealer.

15:22.897 --> 15:28.345
Here's Dick Manny sitting at the elbow of his dealer.

15:28.746 --> 15:30.649
Let's go back to Bradley Martin.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.716
Do you mind for a second?

15:34.736 --> 15:36.158
Some people wondered, felt,

15:36.442 --> 15:41.109
Why didn't, if you knew Bradley Martin, why didn't he designate his collection to go to an institution?

15:41.529 --> 15:54.548
Do you think that he had it in his mind, I got my books from collectors, as Ho said in the first volume of his sale catalog, Beverly Chew said, he said, well, if it weren't for the collectors, where would I have gotten my books?

15:55.790 --> 16:00.357
I mean, this is a nice thing to be said, but I wonder if that's the case.

16:00.377 --> 16:05.925
Or do you think that the Bessemer Trust was, and I know you can't speak for them,

16:06.209 --> 16:13.798
But, nevertheless, one wonders, you had this, what was arguably the finest ornithological collection anywhere.

16:13.838 --> 16:16.481
Would it have been nice to keep it as a collection?

16:16.501 --> 16:17.342
How do you feel about that?

16:17.683 --> 16:18.784
You always have that argument.

16:18.804 --> 16:19.585
This is from my book and not my story.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.928
You always have that argument being made.

16:23.129 --> 16:31.980
I, being in the art world, would prefer to see the things in circulation to give other collectors the enjoyment in perpetuity.

16:32.348 --> 16:36.598
I don't believe that everything can go into a museum, otherwise there would be no collection.

16:36.638 --> 16:45.398
I think that part of things for the education and scholarship of the future should be in institutions.

16:46.159 --> 16:50.830
But I love also to see things which are fresh, wonderful, collectible things.

16:51.215 --> 16:52.538
come onto the market.

16:52.758 --> 17:00.816
It generates and energizes more collectors in the future and has a real place in our society.

17:00.956 --> 17:04.824
So I think it's a good thing that things do come on the market.

17:05.265 --> 17:08.953
The purists, or at least they think of themselves as purists,

17:09.220 --> 17:15.470
I think that would be the worst thing that could happen to the marketplace.

17:15.490 --> 17:18.035
And that doesn't necessarily guarantee access, either.

17:18.055 --> 17:21.080
No, it sure does, because an awful lot of these things never see the light of day.

17:21.320 --> 17:27.330
I mean, Samuel Pepys had a unique private library, and thank goodness it's intact.

17:27.766 --> 17:30.709
but just try and go see any of it.

17:31.349 --> 17:33.231
It's so unique that you can't touch it.

17:33.471 --> 17:34.572
Yeah, the Barnes Corp.

17:34.632 --> 17:37.875
in Philadelphia has to make an appointment to go and see it.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.818
It would be nice if some of those things were out there.

17:40.858 --> 17:43.740
Nicholas Barker was in Worcester, as it happens, two weeks ago.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.963
The American Endocrine Society is there.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.885
Again, it's fortuitous that I see you today.

17:48.905 --> 17:53.930
I was planning a trip to England, interviewed Mr. Barker, and here he comes into my backyard.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.592
That's wonderful.

17:57.415 --> 17:59.638
And he said he knew Martin well himself.

17:59.978 --> 18:10.872
He said, I feel that if he really, he's a white man, articulate, knowledgeable, and that if he wanted this thing to remain as a collection, he would have done it.

18:10.972 --> 18:17.680
And if somebody had gone out, a lot of the things were at the Morgan Library.

18:17.900 --> 18:24.068
If they had made the right overtures and the right plans and all the rest with him, maybe he would have left more.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.870
We can't answer any of those questions now.

18:26.272 --> 18:41.175
But for somebody who was so meticulous with his collection, you have to assume that he would have either made the arrangement, or he didn't make the arrangement because he couldn't bring himself to make it, or he wanted to have happen exactly what did happen.

18:41.335 --> 18:45.141
And I think another argument is people say, well, we want to preserve them.

18:46.100 --> 18:53.568
There are others who say, hey, if a guy pays $2 million for a book, he's going to take good care of it.

18:53.608 --> 18:55.510
He's not going to trap the ball at that point.

18:58.133 --> 19:13.930
Book collectors especially are people that are so meticulous in keeping records and planning and all the rest of it that I would think they would make very inclined arrangements.

19:14.838 --> 19:17.763
You don't get in that much in the book about book collecting.

19:17.783 --> 19:18.103
No.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.489
In trends, I was looking for it in the trends section.

19:21.749 --> 19:24.293
But I would imagine that it parallels everything else.

19:24.313 --> 19:24.574
Yeah.

19:24.754 --> 19:25.976
Well, I know less about it.

19:25.996 --> 19:26.717
There's one reason.

19:27.058 --> 19:30.884
Isn't it interesting, though, to go back to what I was suggesting about a book haul?

19:31.725 --> 19:36.593
You know, years ago, the New York Times, the TBR, you had a rare book haul.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.669
column, regular feature.

19:38.689 --> 19:39.149
That's right.

19:39.249 --> 19:40.150
Nothing like that.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.713
Now, the garden sale rated one graph.

19:42.733 --> 19:44.775
Rita Reif gave it one graph in the Times.

19:45.075 --> 19:46.937
It was buried in the Picasso piece.

19:46.997 --> 19:56.247
The Cooney went for 20 mil the day before, so in context, what the hell is $2 million when you're doing 20 and 30 for other things?

19:56.267 --> 20:01.092
In their minds, they've given too much exposure to Sotheby's auctions.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.015
They don't think of it as what the public is interested in.

20:04.433 --> 20:05.654
Yeah, they do.

20:06.275 --> 20:07.076
It's unbelievable.

20:07.096 --> 20:11.500
That was one of the most fascinating... I mean, that was a week of unbelievable things.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.101
That all should have been covered.

20:13.181 --> 20:15.323
And I have told that to the editors.

20:15.724 --> 20:16.785
But I'm glad.

20:16.945 --> 20:21.149
But Reeder did put Manny's name in the paper, which was a blessing for me.

20:21.810 --> 20:24.332
I knew who he was, and I hadn't even approached him yet.

20:24.352 --> 20:26.334
I wasn't going to approach him until the first of the year.

20:27.015 --> 20:30.438
I had heard that he's a very nice guy, approachable, and maybe ready to talk.

20:31.059 --> 20:33.681
But by her just giving him one sentence in the Times,

20:34.657 --> 20:35.478
It opened it up.

20:35.498 --> 20:36.779
Yeah, but he's happy to talk.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.664
This is the piece I've done for Maine Antiques Digest.

20:40.684 --> 20:44.348
I can't give it to you because it's still... We talk about gambling, right?

20:44.588 --> 20:49.053
This is a quote from... Are you interested in hearing any of this?

20:49.093 --> 20:49.433
Yeah, sure.

20:49.453 --> 20:50.174
This is pretty good.

20:50.294 --> 20:55.860
I have you in here, by the way.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.183
In my heart of hearts, this is... Oh, here we go.

20:59.075 --> 21:04.039
Self-abuse North America, President, Chief Actioneer General, Mary, an open meeting when the Shakespeare is at $500,000.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.062
Say that again.

21:07.122 --> 21:11.766
I look down, and I can see him shaking his head no, but he shook his head no.

21:12.407 --> 21:13.528
Dick did or Cummins did?

21:13.828 --> 21:14.949
No, he was the one.

21:14.989 --> 21:17.711
I mean, Cummins took an order to take the hand.

21:18.412 --> 21:23.296
No, and I looked away, and that's when I looked back at him, and I said, think about it.

21:24.877 --> 21:27.900
I just gave him that moment, and I know the man well.

21:28.792 --> 21:29.993
that I knew he would think about.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.236
I knew he was going to come back in bed.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.137
How did you know that?

21:33.678 --> 21:35.420
It's my instinct.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.863
This is pertinent to the piece and to the book, by the way.

21:37.903 --> 21:39.325
That's why I do what I do.

21:39.926 --> 21:41.508
And better than anybody else.

21:43.230 --> 21:43.750
But I knew it.

21:44.391 --> 21:45.813
I knew that there was another business.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.917
He told me he was willing to go to see me.

21:49.037 --> 21:49.518
He stopped.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.162
He said he stopped, not because of the price.

21:53.497 --> 22:02.731
He said he stopped because he has a second, he already has a second polio, he already has a fourth polio, and he has an opportunity, he had an opportunity to buy another first polio.

22:03.071 --> 22:08.379
And he said, but this is the best set I'll ever see in my lifetime, so go for it.

22:08.399 --> 22:12.044
But that's not in my problem, as it were, or my knowledge.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.566
I had no idea what else he's doing.

22:13.647 --> 22:20.837
Well, I know that he stopped, and I had the other bid, and I knew he would bid again, and that's why I went back there.

22:21.712 --> 22:24.356
Do you think he was good for one more bid, the telephone guy?

22:25.718 --> 22:26.339
Oh, who knows?

22:27.601 --> 22:29.584
You know, I just knew he was, at that moment, I knew.

22:29.764 --> 22:29.924
Yeah.

22:30.966 --> 22:32.408
Tell me something about Haven O'Moore.

22:32.448 --> 22:32.869
I met him.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.672
I've only met him there.

22:34.692 --> 22:36.014
I have no idea about Haven O'Moore.

22:36.034 --> 22:40.781
I talked to him, you know, and I thought I was going to be braced by Secret Service guys.

22:40.821 --> 22:41.983
More power, you did it right.

22:42.183 --> 22:43.645
I read the papers of the courthouse.

22:43.705 --> 22:48.192
I know that you signed the, didn't even have to talk, but I didn't, because it's in the papers.

22:48.627 --> 22:51.931
But, I mean, a confidentiality agreement, so you had to do what you had to do.

22:52.252 --> 22:54.275
And all you have to do is read the forwards of the catalog.

22:54.295 --> 22:54.615
Yeah.

22:55.256 --> 23:01.104
And also, not just the forwards, the statement of the back is extraordinary.

23:01.124 --> 23:01.324
Yeah.

23:01.404 --> 23:03.627
How about that bust?

23:03.647 --> 23:05.750
Where the hell did that bust come from?

23:05.770 --> 23:07.592
That bust himself.

23:07.612 --> 23:08.994
How long was he building the collection?

23:09.014 --> 23:09.415
Do you know that?

23:09.435 --> 23:09.996
I don't know that.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.257
I really have no idea.

23:11.638 --> 23:12.679
Davis is an investor.

23:12.739 --> 23:13.560
Is he from New England?

23:14.622 --> 23:15.403
I assume so.

23:15.623 --> 23:16.404
I mean, I'll go off.

23:16.424 --> 23:17.065
I really don't know.

23:17.618 --> 23:40.437
Well, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

23:40.805 --> 24:09.073
and it's all it's all lucid and it's all absolutely i mean he'll talk you know that's fine but i'm going down to see edwin wolf in philly you know him at rosenbach biographer oh yeah well he knew rose but dave knew he must have very good rosenbach stories all the stories but you know he's worth a profile great you might think about that was he a collector as well dave no i think he just uh informed collection do you think he got set that's a good question isn't it

24:09.914 --> 24:12.357
It's a good question that goes beyond books.

24:12.377 --> 24:15.341
Yeah, kind of like the parent molding the child.

24:15.761 --> 24:16.782
I've seen it go both ways.

24:16.842 --> 24:25.153
You know, a dealer who is a collector has a difficult problem.

24:25.173 --> 24:32.602
Plus, the dealer who is truly the educator in supplying property to his customers, his clients.

24:32.622 --> 24:34.504
I thought it was half an hour, right?

24:34.872 --> 24:35.894
I don't know.

24:36.054 --> 24:37.696
I'm just answering the questions.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.058
I assume she's done something.

24:39.078 --> 24:39.619
Okay, good.

24:39.639 --> 24:40.600
I thought I was out of time.

24:42.403 --> 25:02.753
The dealer who is really acting as the educator and servicing his clients, when faced with finding something which is an unusual rarity, is that dealer obligated to turn over something which he finds to the customer or to give it for his own collections?

25:03.273 --> 25:05.275
when the dealer is a great collector, too.

25:05.315 --> 25:12.163
And I know some who are great collectors and some who have no feeling at all for the object to keep an object.

25:12.183 --> 25:15.106
I mean, they love the object, but they love to sell the object.

25:15.507 --> 25:18.150
There's two different things there, and it's a very interesting thing.

25:18.170 --> 25:25.618
I know a dealer who has one of the great collections in the world of modern art, and it's a difficult problem.

25:26.019 --> 25:31.525
However, I know collectors, and I can only talk to book collectors, who mistrust dealers who collect.

25:32.804 --> 25:36.248
Because he's not going to... That's what you just said.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.710
He's not going to offer me the best stuff.

25:39.071 --> 25:39.412
Right.

25:39.432 --> 25:41.875
You know, if he does, he's going to make the price so dear.

25:41.895 --> 25:52.147
And it's the same reason that people who are collectors who back a dealer, generally speaking, that dealer is not somebody you should buy from.

25:52.167 --> 25:58.094
Because the first shot at all the good things go to the backer.

25:58.114 --> 26:02.119
The dealer has got to be... I know a case where this is precisely the situation.

26:02.588 --> 26:05.392
The guy's a collector and he's an asylum partner in a bookstore.

26:06.152 --> 26:09.457
And all the best stuff goes to him.

26:09.477 --> 26:09.857
Yeah, all the time.

26:09.877 --> 26:11.880
Of course, there's got to be a motive for him doing it.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.542
It's not going to be a financial thing.

26:13.562 --> 26:15.905
You can find lots of other businesses to invest in.

26:16.766 --> 26:18.708
Do you go to flea markets and things?

26:18.728 --> 26:21.432
I have over time, not on a regular basis.

26:21.712 --> 26:22.593
Are you still collecting?

26:22.793 --> 26:24.576
Have you reached kind of the point?

26:25.016 --> 26:27.179
Well, my wife and I have a number of different homes.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.602
And we're trying.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.005
We have different interests in the different homes.

26:32.356 --> 26:40.670
And so the one where my things mainly are, because she is a great collector, where my things mainly are, we're moving into in the next month.

26:41.472 --> 26:43.956
And so a lot of my things have been packed away for a while.

26:44.717 --> 26:47.622
So then we'll start again.

26:47.683 --> 26:53.773
The point of the book, well, obviously, is this to interest more people than go any?

26:54.648 --> 26:56.170
Well, I'll tell you the truth.

26:56.230 --> 26:59.293
The point of the book for me is... Yeah, let's talk a little bit specifically about the book.

26:59.313 --> 27:17.913
To me, the point of this book is really a lifelong aim of mine, which is to take the mystery out of the art market, to have people feel as though they could really come in and not be taken advantage of, that they really could get involved in this process, that it is understandable, that it is enjoyable.

27:18.074 --> 27:20.436
And I spent my life doing this.

27:21.017 --> 27:23.119
When I started in the auction business,

27:23.588 --> 27:26.931
It was caveat emptor, you know, the buyer beware.

27:27.072 --> 27:27.973
It still is.

27:28.193 --> 27:29.935
Well, there's a guarantee of authenticity now.

27:29.955 --> 27:31.056
At your place, yeah.

27:31.076 --> 27:32.597
Well, I put that in, 1972.

27:32.698 --> 27:35.180
It was my first thing I became president.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.103
Guarantee of authenticity and estimates in the catalog.

27:38.944 --> 27:45.651
Now, you think today how helpful all that is, and the fact that you have more illustrations and things like that.

27:46.172 --> 27:49.495
And the customer service department, all these things that are meant

27:49.863 --> 27:54.289
to make the public feel that they can really take part in here and not be threatened.

27:54.889 --> 28:02.880
One of the real problems with somebody that wants to start collecting is that they walk into a dealer's shop and they think, my God, he's going to think I'm stupid.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.001
I don't know anything.

28:04.322 --> 28:06.344
I'll be found out.

28:07.766 --> 28:09.248
And I try to take that away.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.512
That's the real purpose.

28:13.353 --> 28:17.057
Because I think, sincerely, I believe that it is a very enjoyable thing.

28:17.097 --> 28:24.405
And I really do believe that the quality of life is something which is the end product of the amount of effort and everything that goes into it.

28:24.425 --> 28:29.191
And it's something that I've seen over and over again happen in people's lives.

28:29.551 --> 28:32.614
And it's a wonderful thing to have happen.

28:32.634 --> 28:37.660
And it's part of what my whole career has been formed on.

28:37.680 --> 28:41.284
I've got to send you some copies of stories about that.

28:41.618 --> 28:46.343
The first book collecting piece I did, it starts with a quote from Thomas Jefferson, I cannot live without books.

28:47.183 --> 29:00.617
And then there's a quote from Michael Sadler who said, if book collecting and this applies to anything, and you even apply this in your book, it's not necessarily the early bird that gets the worm to come, it's the bird that knows a worm when he sees one.

29:01.598 --> 29:02.318
Wonderful quote.

29:03.279 --> 29:07.103
And then I have a quote from, it's not bad, huh?

29:07.505 --> 29:34.879
who said that michael sadlier who's a famous collector of the 30s and 40s uh i can send an exact quote because it applies to any anything you know and then there's another one a quote from larry mcmurtry's novel cadillac jack which is anything can be anywhere and this guy's a scout and he tells the story in there of going you know cadillac jack is based on a real guy and i'm going to try and find him he goes around a cadillac with cowboy boots

29:35.602 --> 29:37.846
like he just came out of a swamp from Texas.

29:39.288 --> 29:43.496
He had long hair, but he knows everything, and he knows who wants everything.

29:43.516 --> 29:44.377
That's the key, too.

29:44.578 --> 29:45.519
That's key number two.

29:45.620 --> 29:56.599
He is said to have found some kind of exotic vase, Oriental vase, and paid $100 for it, and went to the telephone, and sold it for $100,000, like, over the poem.

29:56.839 --> 29:59.584
I mean, these stories, you have stories like this in the book.

29:59.952 --> 30:04.338
The Tamerlane story is like that sweetmeats tray.

30:04.898 --> 30:06.320
You don't have a picture of that in there.

30:06.340 --> 30:07.321
Bond and Morris.

30:07.342 --> 30:09.304
It's one of the world's ugliest.

30:09.324 --> 30:10.566
The ugliest thing you've ever seen.

30:10.646 --> 30:11.387
It really is.

30:11.407 --> 30:12.408
I wouldn't have ours.

30:12.588 --> 30:14.050
I would have left it there for the five dollars.

30:14.070 --> 30:14.471
But she knew.

30:15.091 --> 30:15.512
She knew.

30:15.872 --> 30:17.154
Yeah, there was something about it.

30:17.194 --> 30:19.557
Or maybe it was whatever it was, three or four dollars.

30:19.577 --> 30:21.560
But lucky for you that your people knew, too.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.062
Oh, yeah.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.605
Well, that's what you have experts for, you know.

30:26.412 --> 30:31.502
I've read somewhere, not your quote, but I'll have their eyes if they make them as not quite.

30:31.603 --> 30:33.026
Where did I read that quote?

30:33.046 --> 30:34.108
I don't think it's your quote.

30:34.128 --> 30:34.809
No, it's not mine.

30:35.010 --> 30:35.911
It would be mine.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.697
But they better be right, something like that.

30:38.717 --> 30:38.817
Yeah.

30:39.719 --> 30:43.407
Well, I'm very fortunate to have the kind of experts that we do have.

30:43.427 --> 30:44.309
That's a great place.

30:45.531 --> 30:47.475
Malcolm Forbes, he collects everything, right?
