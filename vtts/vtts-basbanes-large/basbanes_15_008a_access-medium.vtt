WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:10.747
We're talking to Howard Norman.

00:10.767 --> 00:17.114
I love documents and novels, but they're also the hardest, because books, as you know, speak for themselves.

00:17.495 --> 00:22.981
And that was a great piece that The Globe did on your last year, though.

00:23.101 --> 00:26.265
Yeah, she came up to the house.

00:26.685 --> 00:29.408
There was a long one in the Washington Post.

00:30.109 --> 00:32.552
So I'll have...

00:32.718 --> 00:34.381
I'll have them send that to you.

00:34.561 --> 00:35.543
Elizabeth Calamari.

00:36.324 --> 00:37.225
Oh, I know.

00:37.286 --> 00:39.089
And just call her and she'll send it right away.

00:39.449 --> 00:39.710
Great.

00:40.130 --> 00:40.411
Okay.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.212
Tell her we spoke.

00:41.953 --> 00:42.094
Okay.

00:42.234 --> 00:43.336
Or I can do that later.

00:43.356 --> 00:47.222
So, you take a long time to write books.

00:47.242 --> 00:49.826
I mean, you're a very painstaking author, aren't you?

00:49.846 --> 00:50.668
I read this book.

00:50.968 --> 00:51.289
Yeah.

00:51.429 --> 00:54.594
And this book was, I brought the hardcover for you to inscribe.

00:54.634 --> 00:56.377
That's why I'm here.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.641
It was, it was,

01:00.072 --> 01:03.077
It was actually started before the Northern Lights.

01:03.357 --> 01:04.158
Tell me about that.

01:04.559 --> 01:11.269
Well, I started it, and I got the outline of it, but it just wasn't ready to be written.

01:11.289 --> 01:12.290
Just check in.

01:12.431 --> 01:21.604
It sounds enigmatic, but I just got 70 or 80 pages into it and realized I wasn't ready to write this story yet.

01:24.148 --> 01:26.772
It just wasn't well met with

01:27.038 --> 01:30.701
my imagination of what the dimensions of this story were going to be.

01:30.721 --> 01:33.163
So I set it aside, wrote The Northern Lights.

01:33.884 --> 01:36.867
Which was a wonderful novel, coming-of-age novel.

01:36.947 --> 01:41.371
Coming-of-age novel, and then I left it, and life intervened.

01:41.491 --> 01:48.057
I had a child who moved a lot, wrote a book of stories, and did a lot of traveling.

01:48.777 --> 01:49.898
This was still back there.

01:50.639 --> 01:55.223
Absolutely, and I was keeping notebooks the whole time.

01:55.726 --> 01:59.732
between 1985 and 1992.

02:00.673 --> 02:04.679
What was there about this that was intimidating?

02:04.719 --> 02:06.361
Was it stylistic, thematic?

02:07.242 --> 02:20.441
It wasn't intimidation as much as a conviction that I just felt a sense of something was mitigating, either emotionally or stylistically.

02:21.062 --> 02:22.484
It just didn't ring true.

02:23.566 --> 02:25.108
And when I came back to it,

02:25.713 --> 02:32.141
I had come back from a trip to Newfoundland, a short trip, about 10 days.

02:33.082 --> 02:36.286
And when I came back, I said, all right, now I can write this.

02:37.488 --> 02:38.389
I don't know what it was.

02:39.070 --> 02:45.458
I think it was just realizing how spare I wanted it to be.

02:45.678 --> 02:51.045
The early draft was more, the language seemed too embroidered.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.738
And I just wanted to cut back and cut back and cut back.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.440
So the character was fine.

02:57.061 --> 03:00.124
The character was fine.

03:00.144 --> 03:12.078
The original draft was more or less a fictional biography of Margaret Handel from birth to old age.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.024
It was not told from her point of view.

03:17.044 --> 03:18.586
It was a third-person narration.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.910
And then when I got done with that draft, I said, this is...

03:22.210 --> 03:24.694
This is good material, but it's not a story.

03:25.916 --> 03:33.990
And I just had never felt that fiction was predominantly to impart information, but to tell a good story.

03:34.270 --> 03:35.853
And so I started it over.

03:37.055 --> 03:48.454
And my hope was that when Margaret wasn't present, quite literally present on the page, that a reader like the character Fabian would wonder what she was doing.

03:49.042 --> 03:52.086
So I knew I wanted to feature her and have her as the center.

03:52.206 --> 03:56.593
What do you think enabled you to make that leap, that imaginative leap?

03:56.773 --> 03:57.774
To come back to it?

03:57.794 --> 03:59.837
What gave you the story?

03:59.857 --> 04:11.654
Well, initially, I was researching, working for a film company in Canada, an independent documentary film company.

04:11.674 --> 04:14.418
And they had put me up in a little town called Heart's Desire.

04:15.539 --> 04:18.323
And I was researching...

04:18.657 --> 04:19.298
graveyards.

04:20.740 --> 04:23.565
Graveyards are these great entrees into a community.

04:23.625 --> 04:32.258
The names and the choreographing of families in the graveyard and so on and so forth.

04:32.318 --> 04:36.184
While I was there, I was put up in a small Anglican church.

04:37.105 --> 04:42.053
There was a watercolor of an ibis in the room.

04:42.473 --> 04:46.099
It was rather a monastic setting.

04:47.142 --> 04:55.414
I started to really look at this watercolor, and I thought, this is more than technically competent.

04:56.015 --> 05:00.401
This is really quite a lovely piece of work.

05:00.421 --> 05:03.565
There was no name on it, but there was just the date, 1911.

05:04.747 --> 05:14.601
I thought to myself, what must it have been like to have this talent at this particular time, in this particular place?

05:15.931 --> 05:18.074
How could he be embraced by the world?

05:18.294 --> 05:20.938
Did he or she send paintings out?

05:21.519 --> 05:22.320
Was it a local?

05:22.340 --> 05:23.522
Was this the only painting?

05:24.944 --> 05:28.188
Was the person a professional, as you say?

05:28.289 --> 05:29.110
Didn't know anything.

05:30.592 --> 05:32.595
Was this one of those epiphanous moments?

05:33.075 --> 05:35.599
No, it wasn't epiphanous.

05:35.759 --> 05:44.892
It was over a three-week period where I began to realize that I loved this painting.

05:45.226 --> 05:47.388
And I'd always loved bird art.

05:47.689 --> 05:49.491
Oh, I heard, I read stuff like that.

05:49.571 --> 05:51.974
Edward Lear was someone I loved.

05:52.534 --> 05:55.057
You know the brand new biography of him that just came in?

05:55.077 --> 05:55.498
Really?

05:55.978 --> 06:00.604
Yeah, give me your address at some point and I'll send you the... Really, because Vivian Noakes did... Just came in.

06:01.124 --> 06:02.686
Oh, fantastic, I can't wait.

06:02.786 --> 06:03.447
Just came in.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.648
Scribner's, Scribner's.

06:04.668 --> 06:10.755
Right, because of course here he's known mainly as a limerist, but in Europe he's one of the great bird artists.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.258
In fact, we're going to go to London in three weeks and I'm going to...

06:13.508 --> 06:15.632
get to go to the museum and see some Edward Lears.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.727
Meeting Peter Matheson over there.

06:24.348 --> 06:25.630
Are you crazy about birds?

06:27.173 --> 06:32.563
Because when my dad asked me about the bird collection at the University of Kansas that was acquired by this

06:32.915 --> 06:38.941
Oh, God, I want to hear better.

06:38.961 --> 06:40.603
It's not that I'm crazy about birds.

06:40.643 --> 06:42.124
I like to go out into the areas.

06:42.344 --> 06:43.786
I like the remoteness of it.

06:44.266 --> 06:46.749
It's one of the great collections in the world.

06:46.869 --> 06:47.509
I have to get there.

06:48.410 --> 06:57.059
He was put in a mental hospital by his mother back in the 1940s because of fear he was depleting the family fortune on his collection.

06:57.159 --> 07:02.584
Apparently, at that time, you could commit a person who said he was mentally ill but not insane.

07:02.767 --> 07:11.222
I used to spend far too much money on bird art, on rare monographs.

07:12.224 --> 07:16.912
And I got very, very involved and finally sold a lot of it.

07:16.992 --> 07:19.517
I have a friend who were on the same board together.

07:19.537 --> 07:21.140
He's a professor of class.

07:23.404 --> 07:24.606
He's an obsessed grid.

07:25.193 --> 07:26.835
I should put you in touch with him.

07:26.855 --> 07:27.375
I'd love it.

07:27.395 --> 07:27.795
I'd love it.

07:27.876 --> 07:30.718
Bob Bradley, he's got a collection.

07:30.738 --> 07:31.159
I'd love it.

07:31.179 --> 07:31.779
Where does he live?

07:32.240 --> 07:32.920
Out in Worcester.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.522
Oh, I could just drive down.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.504
Yeah, I'll get him out headless.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.024
I'll see it.

07:37.484 --> 07:39.046
I trace him down.

07:40.487 --> 07:43.490
And I start to swap stuff.

07:43.510 --> 07:47.854
Willie, well, I don't have much to swap, but I just like to see it.

07:48.395 --> 07:54.120
I mean, and what happened was that the film didn't work out.

07:55.147 --> 08:01.014
But I started researching just a little bit, asking around, who did this painting?

08:01.034 --> 08:01.615
It was 1911.

08:01.896 --> 08:10.026
This was in the late, this was in sort of mid-1970s.

08:11.888 --> 08:15.272
And I found some people that told me a little bit about there was a man.

08:16.073 --> 08:22.842
He had in fact been brought up under the indictment of murdering a lighthouse keeper.

08:24.155 --> 08:41.519
And I thought, okay, stop now, because the facts I was starting to find out began to trespass on what I imagined might have happened.

08:41.539 --> 08:49.690
And I think fiction writers will have sentiments like this quite often, that you start to feel

08:50.378 --> 08:53.021
more the journalism of it started to take over.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.864
So I backed away from that.

08:54.884 --> 09:03.154
Sometimes read Stephen Crane's journalism, a ship that sank and he survived, which is thrilling.

09:03.394 --> 09:05.597
But then read The Open Boat.

09:05.617 --> 09:08.160
It's two entirely different things.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.203
There's the art and there's the journalism.

09:10.623 --> 09:12.466
And I started to feel that happen.

09:12.846 --> 09:15.930
So I left it for about a couple months.

09:16.450 --> 09:19.274
And then I forgot now when it was, I guess 1991.

09:19.635 --> 09:22.680
I just started sitting down and writing it.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.925
So have you ever, in fact, gone back to find out precisely what happened?

09:25.945 --> 09:28.489
Well, there's a strange thing that happened.

09:28.529 --> 09:39.927
When I was in Seattle, a woman, a quite elderly woman, said, could I come to your hotel and have tea tomorrow?

09:40.345 --> 09:41.807
And I said, I'm in Seattle now.

09:41.827 --> 09:42.408
In Seattle.

09:42.428 --> 09:43.850
What was you on the other side of the hotel?

09:43.870 --> 09:44.891
I was on the book tour.

09:44.911 --> 09:50.980
Yeah, but I mean, she's out here and... Yeah, and she was living with her great-niece or a niece.

09:52.502 --> 10:01.755
Anyway, she brought three or four watercolor paintings to the hotel, and I knew that they were done by the same person.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.477
What a great story.

10:03.497 --> 10:05.240
It was her great-uncle.

10:06.762 --> 10:09.205
And I was so grateful, Nick, that she...

10:09.725 --> 10:17.533
that I didn't know this story before I wrote the book, because it would have just totally changed my whole perspective.

10:18.113 --> 10:20.296
And she told me his fate.

10:20.836 --> 10:22.558
She told me his fate.

10:23.319 --> 10:38.854
It was peculiar to hear that when The Bird Artist ends, Fabian is 20 or 21, this woman finally sort of literally filled me in on a fictional character's life.

10:38.952 --> 10:40.114
You're giving me so many problems.

10:40.174 --> 10:41.877
How do I start this story?

10:42.879 --> 10:46.345
I always feel I know the lead, but you're giving me at least three leads.

10:47.026 --> 10:47.487
Go ahead.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.929
So that was interesting.

10:49.570 --> 10:58.326
And the same thing happened... Do you prefer the way... Fictionally, or the way it happened?

10:58.987 --> 11:03.795
The way he ended up would have taken me on into his 70s.

11:04.535 --> 11:06.417
And I had no interest in it.

11:06.437 --> 11:09.401
But in terms of your conception of the characters?

11:09.841 --> 11:14.767
No, I prefer, I'm happy with it.

11:15.068 --> 11:28.704
Like last night at the reading, a lot of people were asking questions about how could someone who seems to be so passive about so many tumultuous events as Fabian actually murder a lighthouse keeper.

11:28.764 --> 11:33.630
And I said, well, this was just the choreographing of a number of events plus fate.

11:33.847 --> 11:36.832
at a certain moment in this guy's life, it built up to them.

11:37.773 --> 11:42.441
So it didn't seem, you know, paradoxical even to me.

11:42.882 --> 11:45.466
It just seemed part of his character.

11:46.107 --> 11:48.551
But, no, I prefer it the way it is.

11:50.454 --> 11:52.196
But, I mean, there were no second doubts.

11:52.938 --> 11:54.100
I wish I'd known that.

11:54.120 --> 11:54.660
No, none at all.

11:54.921 --> 11:57.325
I was intrigued.

11:57.345 --> 12:00.630
Did it bring a kind of personal closure to the thing for you, though, in a way?

12:01.285 --> 12:07.694
Because I know for myself, being my roots are in journalism, and I always want to know what happened.

12:08.535 --> 12:09.577
Privately, yes.

12:10.738 --> 12:11.579
Literarily.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.220
As an artist.

12:12.941 --> 12:13.562
Completed work.

12:13.662 --> 12:16.967
It was fine, just letting it go.

12:16.987 --> 12:22.635
What a great story that is.

12:23.408 --> 12:25.591
Care to tell me?

12:25.691 --> 12:26.772
Her first name is Edna.

12:27.132 --> 12:28.634
The woman named Edna.

12:28.654 --> 12:30.056
Yeah, that's her first name.

12:30.076 --> 12:31.337
And how old was she about?

12:32.379 --> 12:35.242
My guess would be she's close to 90.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.584
She's at least 85.

12:36.744 --> 12:37.605
And she came to see you?

12:38.025 --> 12:38.245
Yes.

12:38.626 --> 12:39.988
So she'd heard about the book?

12:40.008 --> 12:40.328
Yes.

12:40.348 --> 12:42.951
Her niece had given it to her.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.894
And the niece told me she was quite upset.

12:46.555 --> 12:49.158
And I thought that she was going to be upset with me.

12:49.178 --> 12:49.939
But not at all.

12:49.979 --> 12:51.441
We talked for three hours.

12:52.366 --> 12:54.369
So she was not upset?

12:54.489 --> 13:03.141
No, she was very clear about what a novel was and what the truth was.

13:03.181 --> 13:12.534
She just hadn't been in Newfoundland in 50 years and wanted to talk about it.

13:14.797 --> 13:15.318
That's great.

13:15.338 --> 13:22.187
And it was more like just a nostalgic tour

13:24.040 --> 13:26.342
You work, as I understand, seven days a week.

13:27.483 --> 13:28.805
I try.

13:28.845 --> 13:34.210
This last year it hasn't been so easy, but I try to work every day.

13:37.673 --> 13:39.375
Do you try and write a draft?

13:39.855 --> 13:41.777
Yeah, I do.

13:41.977 --> 13:44.820
And then just keep reworking it and reworking it?

13:45.040 --> 13:53.068
Like the novel I'm working on now, Nick, I'm writing a draft of it pretty much straight through.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.642
It's called The Museum Garden.

13:55.722 --> 13:57.545
It's set in Halifax.

13:58.066 --> 13:59.528
Boy, Canada.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.370
Yeah.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.212
We'll talk about that.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.013
We'll talk about it.

14:03.253 --> 14:04.034
We'll talk about it.

14:04.475 --> 14:10.924
I'm utterly... But there's another book coming out before that at Farrar Strauss next fall.

14:11.485 --> 14:14.570
Not this fall, but the Halloween year.

14:14.590 --> 14:14.850
Series?

14:15.150 --> 14:15.311
Novel?

14:15.371 --> 14:19.697
No, it's a novella, and it's...

14:20.082 --> 14:21.785
It's sort of a book for all ages.

14:22.025 --> 14:27.234
It's a book that takes place during Hanukkah in Nova Scotia.

14:27.495 --> 14:33.465
And the family calls themselves the Jewish community in this area.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.769
It's called Reunion.

14:36.650 --> 14:43.963
And it's something I've wanted to write for a long time, about an immigrant, rural Jewish family.

14:45.023 --> 14:46.225
That's amazing.

14:46.445 --> 14:50.651
I interviewed Patrick O'Brien last week in New York.

14:50.872 --> 14:52.334
He's a wonderful writer.

14:52.654 --> 15:07.476
People who think that he just writes these Bounding Mains, stories of the Bounding Mains, but I bring this up because he said the ocean for me is like Paris for Proust.

15:08.638 --> 15:11.402
You can see where I'm going with this.

15:11.686 --> 15:12.547
Why Canada?

15:12.567 --> 15:24.787
Well, I mean, what is, I mean, obviously there's a scheme of isolation, and there's this landscape, I hate to hear the cliché plays, landscaping, imagination, and all that, but maybe just talk a little bit about it.

15:24.807 --> 15:30.636
No, I mean, first of all, in The Bird Artist, I tried to develop the landscape the same way one would develop a character.

15:32.158 --> 15:35.023
It interacted with people.

15:35.063 --> 15:37.206
It's sort of ubiquitous.

15:37.226 --> 15:39.550
I mean, the Newfoundland landscape is

15:39.833 --> 15:42.276
despair and harsh and all those things.

15:43.377 --> 16:04.120
And I have been long interested in characters who are already in somewhat remote places, but through their behavior and through fate become even more remote.

16:04.825 --> 16:16.256
So if you have a character who's in a small town, like a lighthouse keeper, who is also reclusive, that kind of character really interests me.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.959
The dimensions of a book, for me, are important.

16:19.979 --> 16:26.145
I like to have it contained, but then push the edges of what that could be.

16:26.165 --> 16:27.606
I'm not a writer, at least now.

16:27.626 --> 16:33.111
I was writing a big, sprawling cathedral of a book.

16:33.310 --> 16:41.803
I like to try to see what's possible within the confines of a sort of medium-sized novel.

16:41.823 --> 16:45.548
And Canada, I mean, I spent a lot of time in Canada.

16:45.568 --> 16:47.892
I've spent a lot of time in remote places in Canada.

16:48.292 --> 16:52.959
But Canada, in some ways for me, and this may be laughable, is exotic.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.081
Why?

16:54.281 --> 17:00.330
Because if you go into certain areas in Canada, there's a different language spoken, say, in the native areas.

17:00.648 --> 17:03.632
a different language spoken every 100 to 150 miles.

17:04.332 --> 17:06.555
Linguistically, it's very eclectic.

17:07.636 --> 17:21.974
If you telescope in on any one town or block or village, and this is true of anywhere, really, but for me, in Canada, full stories come out of it.

17:22.975 --> 17:30.604
And, for instance, in the museum card, I talked rather inadvertently one day to a guy who had been

17:31.141 --> 17:34.264
the guard in a small museum in Halifax.

17:35.025 --> 17:35.505
Whammo!

17:35.646 --> 17:36.246
There it was.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.749
The whole thing unfolded.

17:39.249 --> 17:41.211
This book is set right before World War II.

17:43.794 --> 17:46.977
The story isn't just about him.

17:47.377 --> 17:59.089
It's about a man and his nephew, who are the only two museum guards in the museum, who are in love with the same woman, unbeknownst to each other for a long time.

17:59.423 --> 18:08.977
A painting arrives and all three of them, they all have a different obsessive response to the painting.

18:10.179 --> 18:16.588
But I like that, where you start with a venue this wide and you move in tighter on it.

18:16.608 --> 18:17.590
Almost like a sonnet.

18:17.630 --> 18:25.802
That wonderful Shakespeare sonnet at this time of year when he goes from autumn to the day.

18:26.052 --> 18:27.294
The embers in the fire.

18:27.694 --> 18:29.657
I like that psychological compression.

18:29.737 --> 18:31.259
The circle.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.425
I like that psychological compression.

18:37.228 --> 18:42.495
And I like to work with... I like writing about Canada.

18:42.515 --> 18:43.316
I like being there.

18:43.337 --> 18:44.678
I like thinking about it.

18:44.759 --> 18:47.042
It's my fictional terrain.

18:47.763 --> 18:52.870
Is there something O'Brien's isolation, he says, does bring out...

18:55.263 --> 18:58.646
I mean, what is it about a ship at sea?

18:58.666 --> 19:01.229
I spent three years on an aircraft carrier.

19:01.329 --> 19:03.311
I have a sense of what this is about.

19:03.331 --> 19:08.796
There are people every day that you see, whether you want to or not.

19:09.557 --> 19:20.528
And I guess going way up here in this vast area really does challenge... And this new book set in Halifax isn't quite that, but here's what I think.

19:20.668 --> 19:23.110
I think that it's really interesting as a fiction writer.

19:23.933 --> 19:38.367
To go into a small place like that and you see two types, you see many types, but two of the types that you see are people that won't leave and people that have come from some other place in order to be just in that kind of place.

19:38.827 --> 19:44.233
And sometimes when those two leave, there are interesting things that happen.

19:44.253 --> 19:46.295
You know, what is someone leaving?

19:47.255 --> 19:47.976
It's intriguing.

19:49.157 --> 19:52.000
What is a place like this a reprieve from?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.187
What are they looking for?

19:54.788 --> 20:05.440
And on the opposite side of that, why are people willing to stay in a place like these small villages?

20:07.823 --> 20:09.665
Vermont is a lot like that in some ways.

20:10.246 --> 20:11.087
Oh, I would think so.

20:11.127 --> 20:11.768
In some ways.

20:12.488 --> 20:16.193
Although it's much more, generally more cosmopolitan.

20:16.213 --> 20:17.634
You have quite a community up there.

20:17.875 --> 20:18.836
Quite a community.

20:18.896 --> 20:20.378
Wonderful writers.

20:20.398 --> 20:20.738
There's

20:21.325 --> 20:23.888
My wife, Jane Shore, is a book poet.

20:25.130 --> 20:28.614
Dave Mamet is really close to us.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.338
I mean, he's a really great friend.

20:31.358 --> 20:34.461
Joyce Johnson, wonderful novels and memoirs, too.

20:35.363 --> 20:38.366
Oh, she hasn't done something anything in quite a while, I see.

20:38.386 --> 20:39.388
She's working on a novel.

20:39.408 --> 20:43.072
Her last book was the book on the Steinberg case, Lisa Steinberg.

20:43.413 --> 20:43.753
Oh, right.

20:43.813 --> 20:46.757
So that's actually more recent than I realized.

20:46.777 --> 20:46.877
Yeah.

20:48.646 --> 20:51.651
Catherine Davis, a good fiction writer.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.173
Ellen Voigt.

20:53.593 --> 20:54.355
Louise Gluck.

20:54.555 --> 20:55.937
They're all neighbors and friends.

20:56.738 --> 21:01.085
So there's a kind of... Ed Coren, the cartoonist, is there.

21:01.105 --> 21:03.128
We have a nice community of people.

21:03.769 --> 21:05.832
Now you're up here how long?

21:05.912 --> 21:08.195
We've been up for the last year.

21:08.316 --> 21:10.759
We'll be gone next year and then back up for 18 months.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.423
So we're spending as much time as we can.

21:13.764 --> 21:17.910
And we're hoping to, I mean, as soon as possible, move here permanently.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.557
Do you enjoy teaching?

21:25.924 --> 21:36.880
Without sounding coy, I think for me, it's the next best thing to not teach.

21:38.001 --> 21:42.368
I mean, it's good to be able to talk about what you love with students.

21:43.028 --> 21:44.310
I'm in an MFA program.

21:46.233 --> 21:48.336
But in all honesty,

21:49.025 --> 21:53.008
I came to teaching full-time rather late.

21:53.029 --> 21:53.529
I was 38.

21:55.150 --> 22:00.615
I have never been able to shake a fundamental ambivalence about teaching.

22:01.356 --> 22:07.521
Not about the validity of it, but just my role in it.

22:08.502 --> 22:11.685
I'm cutting down on it.

22:11.945 --> 22:18.711
Do you feel that you're being pulled away from what you would much rather be doing than just writing?

22:19.838 --> 22:32.977
I think teaching is, I think there's only so many things you can do full-time.

22:34.218 --> 22:37.583
And teaching, even if you're teaching a little bit, seems to be full-time.

22:38.064 --> 22:47.517
And I think it, for me, and I can't speak for anyone else, it's an adversarial situation.

22:48.982 --> 22:51.925
You write very—you don't mind our jumping around.

22:52.025 --> 22:52.445
Not at all.

22:52.685 --> 22:53.166
Anything.

22:53.246 --> 22:57.029
And, you know, forgive me if we don't get into the book itself.

22:57.069 --> 22:58.130
That's my job.

22:58.150 --> 22:58.730
You can do that.

22:58.931 --> 22:59.171
Yeah.

23:00.792 --> 23:05.056
But it is, however, interesting that you do pick specific times, really.

23:05.436 --> 23:06.837
I mean, you took 1911.

23:06.958 --> 23:10.060
There was a circumstance that directed that.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.863
Now, the work in progress is just before World War II.

23:13.964 --> 23:17.006
You really do evoke time.

23:17.447 --> 23:18.988
There's a reason for that, too.

23:19.475 --> 23:26.143
because the painting that arrives is called A Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam.

23:27.525 --> 23:40.401
And the female protagonist is a young woman who is the caretaker of the very small Jewish cemetery in Halifax.

23:41.682 --> 23:47.389
And at the end of this new novel, she...

23:47.808 --> 23:53.634
more or less has become the woman in the painting and goes into Europe, just as everyone's fleeing Europe.

23:54.855 --> 23:57.698
We'll be in Amsterdam in three weeks.

23:59.240 --> 24:07.388
So the time setting of these novels is not arbitrary.

24:09.491 --> 24:16.718
But it is interesting, however, that you're not intimidated by evoking periods that you have no possible way of

24:17.322 --> 24:19.365
knowing anything about it on a first-hand basis.

24:19.405 --> 24:21.389
No, I'm more comfortable with it.

24:21.409 --> 24:27.780
I don't know that I wrote a couple stories about it in the present, but I'm not that comfortable with contemporary.

24:27.800 --> 24:37.035
And also, I don't think I could write psychologically sophisticated enough stuff in the present right now.

24:37.150 --> 24:38.391
But I'm getting closer, Nick.

24:38.451 --> 24:39.572
I'm moving up.

24:39.592 --> 24:42.195
Is this an attempt, or are you just more comfortable doing it?

24:42.215 --> 24:42.735
I'm just more comfortable.

24:42.755 --> 24:43.897
I'm more intrigued by it.

24:44.297 --> 24:49.502
Do you believe that human nature is a constant in any case, that you can move around from time to time?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.443
To some extent.

24:51.023 --> 24:54.447
I think that it's a fiction writer's job, almost, to argue that.

24:54.467 --> 25:00.533
I mean, I think it's good to—I mean, I wouldn't strive for universals on any level.

25:00.553 --> 25:07.039
I would just like to just—I mean, with a bird artist, I tried very, very consciously

25:07.492 --> 25:18.585
not to impose any contemporary psychologizing on these characters, but sort of let faith move them in whatever directions they were going.

25:19.426 --> 25:24.772
Are you familiar, and this is totally irrelevant, but are you familiar at all of the Senior Baxter movies?

25:24.792 --> 25:25.973
Have you ever seen Senior Baxter?

25:25.993 --> 25:26.774
No, no, I haven't.

25:26.794 --> 25:29.717
She was a very... But this would tell me that.

25:30.338 --> 25:31.299
Now, let's start again.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.702
How are you feeling now about...

25:35.150 --> 25:36.772
literacy, the state of the art.

25:36.792 --> 25:40.337
You know, Sven Burkert's book just came out about the Gutenberg.

25:41.298 --> 25:41.738
Yeah.

25:41.838 --> 25:50.509
I mean, you're a person who has feelings about this because I mindfully have targeted cities.

25:51.991 --> 25:55.015
I just throw darts and say, gee, I think I'll try Eugene, Oregon.

25:55.035 --> 25:59.280
I think I'll try Kingsville, Florida.

25:59.380 --> 26:03.405
I look and see what books are sold and what people are interested in.

26:03.425 --> 26:04.667
And where they are interested in

26:05.525 --> 26:07.908
discussing things like this.

26:07.928 --> 26:11.652
And it's amazing the letters I'm getting from the readers.

26:11.753 --> 26:16.578
I did a piece on this Norwegian guy, Jostin Gardner, Sophie's World.

26:16.639 --> 26:18.841
It's a novel about the... I've seen it, yeah.

26:19.782 --> 26:23.787
And I said to myself, Jesus, this is going to bore people silly.

26:23.827 --> 26:24.828
They're not even going to use it.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.674
Everywhere that I sent it, they don't know where to use this story.

26:31.136 --> 26:32.818
They don't want it.

26:32.838 --> 26:34.300
And the reaction to it...

26:34.735 --> 26:39.182
My paper and Allen phone, The Morning Call, which takes me a couple times a month.

26:39.202 --> 26:40.464
He gave it a big point.

26:40.484 --> 26:42.227
You know what I'm saying?

26:42.247 --> 26:45.653
My sense is that this is the kind of book that people wouldn't have been interested in.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.778
It would bore them, but it didn't at all.

26:49.138 --> 26:50.561
No, I think it is.

26:50.581 --> 26:53.105
It's just entirely very gratifying.

26:53.205 --> 26:53.646
You can't predict.

26:53.666 --> 26:54.187
It's hard to predict.

26:54.207 --> 26:56.911
So, you know, my answer is there are readers out there, thank God.

26:57.732 --> 26:59.916
Bill Roth came to it.

27:00.588 --> 27:04.733
My wife schooled George Washington, and he said, there's 50,000 readers.

27:04.753 --> 27:05.334
That's right.

27:05.354 --> 27:06.275
I put that figure.

27:06.295 --> 27:06.515
Yeah.

27:06.995 --> 27:16.206
I mean, he meant, and when asked what he meant, he said, people who read books, who, after dinner, don't turn on the television, but sit down and read.

27:16.226 --> 27:17.528
Yeah, but you know why he says that?

27:17.708 --> 27:18.349
He's angry.

27:18.369 --> 27:23.074
Because his sales have been going down, down, down.

27:23.114 --> 27:26.258
Did the, uh, somebody told me, Operation Shiloh told me this?

27:26.899 --> 27:27.499
Yeah, he told me this.

27:27.519 --> 27:28.080
How would it be?

27:28.246 --> 27:31.770
Harold Green told me that he gave me that same quote from Mark.

27:31.790 --> 27:34.754
He's very friendly with Philip Rock.

27:35.315 --> 27:37.357
And I think that the life is a wonderful life.

27:37.537 --> 27:40.021
And his stuff only gets better as far as I'm concerned.

27:40.301 --> 27:41.262
No question.

27:41.282 --> 27:43.585
I thought the counter life was amazing.

27:43.605 --> 27:47.450
And he has every reason to be disturbed.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.652
What do I have to do to get readers?

27:52.075 --> 27:54.979
He's a serious writer, a very serious writer.

27:55.246 --> 27:56.188
He's really wonderful.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.430
It was Bloom that told me that.

27:57.490 --> 27:58.411
He's not funny.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.314
One of the greats.

28:00.394 --> 28:01.456
Now that book I did.

28:01.616 --> 28:02.938
Which is precisely this subject.

28:02.958 --> 28:03.319
Shylock?

28:03.740 --> 28:04.080
No, no.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.164
Harold Bloom's book on the Western.

28:06.244 --> 28:07.025
Oh, right, right.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.050
Everywhere I go, I took it.

28:10.691 --> 28:11.592
I enjoyed it.

28:11.612 --> 28:17.342
I gave a good claim where he's talking about this declining literacy and all this other stuff.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.106
Not just literacy, but this rather sad trend.

28:21.875 --> 28:32.293
I don't know, in my child, you know, Emma's... Imagine putting Shakespeare in the same box with, because it's poetically correct, you know, you only do two or three plays.

28:32.594 --> 28:32.754
Right.

28:33.335 --> 28:46.718
And not to mention any names or any other... No, no, no, I... Alice Walker should be taught in the same level with, because for any number of reasons, it's appropriate to be teaching Alice Walker right now.

28:47.018 --> 28:50.123
I love Bloom's Rages and Rants.

28:50.323 --> 28:50.764
I love them.

28:50.824 --> 28:51.645
I think it's great.

28:51.665 --> 28:54.189
We have the same agent, by the way.

28:54.209 --> 28:55.851
I think it's great.

28:56.352 --> 29:00.398
Agree or disagree, it's good to have the catalyst.

29:00.559 --> 29:06.568
He reads so brilliantly when he focuses on his literary courses.

29:06.588 --> 29:09.051
I've known people who've had him as a professor.

29:09.072 --> 29:14.680
I want to ask him questions, because I really read footnotes, and I love the back-of-the-book stuff.

29:15.453 --> 29:21.481
And I would say, now, why are you doing two different translations of Sophocles here?

29:21.501 --> 29:22.803
I mean, is this just average?

29:22.823 --> 29:23.764
And he'd give you a reason.

29:23.964 --> 29:24.305
Yeah.

29:24.445 --> 29:30.152
I mean, why he liked the Antigone better than he liked the... You know what I'm saying?

29:30.172 --> 29:31.474
Not a man without opinions.

29:31.494 --> 29:32.455
You know what I mean?

29:32.475 --> 29:32.676
Right.

29:32.756 --> 29:33.657
It wasn't fluff.

29:33.677 --> 29:35.079
I mean, he didn't just pad this thing.

29:35.099 --> 29:35.960
Now, what's your time, Dad?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.822
What's your time?

29:37.843 --> 29:38.023
I'm fine.

29:38.043 --> 29:38.744
I'm great.

29:38.764 --> 29:38.864
Okay.

29:39.224 --> 29:40.406
You don't mind jumping around?

29:40.446 --> 29:40.887
Not at all.

29:41.728 --> 29:45.072
And, of course, remember the radio as a metaphor and...

29:45.642 --> 29:48.986
Again, you had to pick a certain time.

29:49.947 --> 29:50.347
Yeah.

29:50.847 --> 29:58.676
And also, I noticed that it wasn't until the end of The Bird Artist that I'd realized I'd done something.

29:58.856 --> 30:06.084
You know, people think that writers are so in control and so conscious of all their narrative strategies.

30:06.164 --> 30:07.245
Well, sometimes you are.

30:07.926 --> 30:12.190
But, for instance, at the end of The Bird Artist, when Isaac Sprague, The Bird Artist,

30:12.760 --> 30:15.623
who Fabian has been corresponding with, shows up.

30:17.124 --> 30:32.679
A somewhat analogous thing happened at the end of the Northern Lights when a radio announcer that this kid in the far north had been listening to, he runs into him in Toronto.

30:33.940 --> 30:40.827
And so I suppose that a lot of what I'm interested in, especially in these small villages,

30:41.110 --> 30:58.490
are what happens when something from the outside comes in, how it stirs things up, or how the threat of another place might act on someone's life individually, or longing or desire to be out in the larger world.

30:59.271 --> 31:03.837
Those things intrigue me, and I guess I'll continue to write about them.

31:05.098 --> 31:08.282
Do you ever think about writing a big book?

31:08.498 --> 31:37.257
The novels that I have outlined, Nick, are not what I would call big books on the level of, say... Well, on the level of, say, I'm reading now and working with... That sounds too presumptuous, but working with the...

31:37.490 --> 31:45.319
on this second, third volume of his Killing Mr. Watson trilogy.

31:45.339 --> 31:45.739
Oh, interesting.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.684
And this is enormous.

31:50.205 --> 31:51.286
And what's your undertaking?

31:51.386 --> 31:57.493
I don't want to feature myself in it, but we've known each other a long time.

31:57.733 --> 32:02.839
And I'm simply, when I was out there, we were doing this

32:03.950 --> 32:07.275
the longest Paris Review interview in the history of Paris Review.

32:07.596 --> 32:10.821
I've now got 22 hours of tapes.

32:10.841 --> 32:14.086
And we're old friends, and we're going to go up to Canada together next summer.

32:14.146 --> 32:16.390
You're interviewing him for Paris Review?

32:16.410 --> 32:17.552
Yeah, yeah.

32:17.572 --> 32:23.401
About five years ago, he came to Washington, and he said, Plimpton's been after me, you know, and I don't want to do it.

32:23.461 --> 32:24.503
And I said, so don't do it.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.025
He said, I'm going to do it.

32:26.528 --> 32:31.873
And then there was silence in the car, and he looked at me, and we both burst into laughter.

32:31.893 --> 32:34.315
I said, he said, but we can't do it the normal way.

32:34.375 --> 32:37.919
You know, we're meeting here, and we're meeting there, and we're meeting out in Long Island.

32:37.939 --> 32:42.843
I think writing the prefatory remarks of it has had to be... It's going to be a long book.

32:42.863 --> 32:43.784
It's going to be book length.

32:44.605 --> 32:55.675
And the second volume is now, I think, 11 or 1,200 pages that I have.

32:56.060 --> 33:03.328
I'm reading it, and we're discussing where to cut, what to do, what is it, because he's been involved with it for 17 years.

33:04.290 --> 33:11.758
The third volume, which is a first-person narration from Edgar Watson's point of view, is complete as far as I'm concerned.

33:13.240 --> 33:22.911
In other words, I've been seeing the sort of symphonic dimensions of this kind of book.

33:23.583 --> 33:28.229
I'm just sort of vaguely intrigued at the possibility.

33:28.249 --> 33:32.674
But for me, I know that the next couple of novels I write are not going to be that.

33:32.694 --> 33:38.942
They're going to be more or less around the 250 or 300 pages long.

33:39.022 --> 33:42.266
It just seems how I work, most comfortably.

33:42.566 --> 33:47.392
I did an interview with Nadine Gordimer here in Cambridge last fall.

33:47.412 --> 33:49.615
What's he doing with that?

33:49.695 --> 33:49.995
Yeah.

33:50.954 --> 33:53.837
Because she's very, very prolific.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.759
She's written tons of stuff.

33:55.859 --> 34:03.647
She maintained that everything she writes, as she said, it's almost like going into a room and looking at a sculpture.

34:03.787 --> 34:07.591
And you walk around and you see it from a different angle.

34:07.611 --> 34:12.616
She looks at the body of her work as a sculpture.

34:12.636 --> 34:20.083
And that every book is kind of a look at the core or whatever from a different angle.

34:20.671 --> 34:23.174
And, of course, it's a corpus, in other words.

34:23.234 --> 34:26.337
And I wonder if you feel the same way.

34:26.397 --> 34:26.758
I do.

34:27.378 --> 34:30.181
I mean, I wouldn't say it quite as articulately as that.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.405
I don't know if I paraphrase it articulately.

34:33.645 --> 34:50.003
I think it's more that I really do see, well, I think this new book and the one after that

34:50.236 --> 35:08.080
as not thematically a quartet, but in terms of my interest in these kinds of situations in Canada, I see that as sort of a more succinctly defined corpus of work.

35:09.142 --> 35:17.273
So geographically and all that, I think I find strong connections, and I would agree that sort of approaching

35:18.265 --> 35:21.368
certain basic themes from different angles.

35:21.488 --> 35:23.210
And what are they in your mind?

35:25.292 --> 35:33.140
Again, how history and faith imposes itself on people in small communities.

35:34.942 --> 35:47.074
I think, to some extent, especially in this new book, it's a, I hope,

35:49.282 --> 36:19.238
generous and I think to some extent extreme take on unrequited love on one level what passion can do to people when their life is otherwise limited in some way I guess some of those things I just keep coming back to one of my favorite writers is Tanizaki

36:19.859 --> 36:22.282
Japanese writer, Junichiro Tanizaki.

36:22.322 --> 36:24.124
He's a very eccentric writer.

36:26.186 --> 36:37.178
He, in a way, not thematically, but sort of emotionally, is kind of a mentor, if you will.

36:38.700 --> 36:49.832
He's interested in day-to-day people living day-to-day lives, and somehow fate thrusts them into acting differently and

36:50.302 --> 36:52.586
even eccentrically.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.829
They hardly recognize themselves.

36:55.330 --> 36:56.311
I like those moments.

36:57.013 --> 37:04.264
You certainly will find me suggesting that I'm publishing my first book.

37:04.324 --> 37:06.808
I'll be 52.

37:07.249 --> 37:08.831
So you started late in life.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.295
You were about 35 or something like that.

37:11.876 --> 37:15.221
I was 38 when the Northern Lights came out.

37:15.582 --> 37:16.343
But you might just

37:16.880 --> 37:22.847
You were doing other things with your life, and I don't think you just decided, gee, I think it's time to be a writer.

37:23.528 --> 37:35.262
No, I had tried, I mean, in terms of fiction, Nick, I had tried, I had written a couple of short novels and shown them to a couple people.

37:36.944 --> 37:44.794
And I was writing natural history, and I was writing, doing a lot of translation work and so forth.

37:45.230 --> 37:55.039
I think it was really meeting my wife, who had been a poet for many, many years, and was teaching at the time at Topps.

37:56.720 --> 37:57.641
You met her here, right?

37:57.761 --> 37:58.462
I met her here.

38:00.264 --> 38:07.270
Philip Levine introduced us, and Phil and Fran were old friends, and we got together, and they introduced us on Thanksgiving.

38:07.290 --> 38:08.691
A poet of no small accomplishment.

38:08.731 --> 38:15.017
No, wonderful man.

38:17.798 --> 38:21.443
basically said, you know, you just don't seem to be doing what you really want to do.

38:21.523 --> 38:23.446
And I said, well, you know, I've been trying to write fiction.

38:23.466 --> 38:27.150
And she said, well, then cut away everything else and just do it.

38:27.531 --> 38:29.594
And, you know, we were living together at that time.

38:29.774 --> 38:37.284
And I'd set aside The Bird Artist as it was in that form and started writing The Northern Lights.

38:37.304 --> 38:41.590
And so I felt it was a natural time for me to start writing fiction.

38:41.630 --> 38:46.757
I felt it was then sort of like stop talking about it and do it.

38:46.957 --> 38:47.097
Mm-hmm.

38:47.802 --> 38:51.445
And Jane was central to all that.

38:52.767 --> 39:05.278
So I know it does, especially compared to how young people are today with publishing, it seems late, but it doesn't seem late to me.

39:05.318 --> 39:15.548
And also, most of my favorite writers wrote, really began writing late, whatever that means, whatever late means.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.528
There are things you can't do at a certain age, and I firmly believe that.

39:22.548 --> 39:28.216
It's very hard for me to take anything seriously by fiction by anybody who's in the middle.

39:28.236 --> 39:30.799
They were only 20s.

39:30.919 --> 39:32.361
It does happen.

39:32.862 --> 39:41.873
It does happen, but I don't, whether it's a bias or not, I seem to be attracted

39:42.393 --> 39:42.994
not to that.

39:43.014 --> 39:47.077
I don't mean to think it's just experience or having a little longer.

39:47.097 --> 39:49.219
I think it's just knowing more and feeling.

39:51.120 --> 39:57.526
Also, I mean, coming into it and what I did, I felt totally unintimidated.

39:58.066 --> 39:59.828
I knew I wasn't going to compromise.

40:00.828 --> 40:03.591
I mean, that's not what it was about.

40:03.631 --> 40:05.172
I wasn't trying to please anybody.

40:05.192 --> 40:09.356
I thought, write what only you can write and then take your chances.

40:10.737 --> 40:12.298
And so I

40:12.633 --> 40:17.459
I didn't feel I was trying to be part of a network or part of anything.

40:17.479 --> 40:22.546
I didn't come out of writing programs or a literary background.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.927
I didn't have a literary family.

40:24.828 --> 40:28.213
I was on my own with it, and I thought, well, c'est la vie.

40:29.174 --> 40:30.015
And that's what it was.

40:30.335 --> 40:41.830
Richard Eater has... It's...

40:42.822 --> 40:47.129
It's not only because he's been generous toward me, but he's been instructive.

40:48.551 --> 40:52.217
And there's not a lot of people who can say that about him.

40:52.438 --> 40:54.141
In what respect now?

40:54.301 --> 40:55.142
Individually?

40:55.242 --> 40:56.224
Are you in his writing?

40:56.785 --> 41:04.858
I mean in the sense that he has said things, he has pointed out things in reviews of my books.

41:06.441 --> 41:08.965
And I would say most especially the short stories.

41:09.704 --> 41:13.709
which he liked a lot more than I do.

41:14.930 --> 41:26.164
But that aside, he pointed out certain things just in the phrasings, which were just instructional to me.

41:26.304 --> 41:28.487
I mean, quite literally instructional.

41:28.627 --> 41:31.230
There are certain things that I will not do now.

41:33.954 --> 41:35.796
And the book

41:36.350 --> 41:41.418
And I think writers are stubborn and they're loathe to, you know, they're opinionated.

41:42.599 --> 41:46.745
You know, Flannery O'Connor said that every sentence is an opinion.

41:47.446 --> 41:48.468
It's true.

41:50.471 --> 41:56.420
You know, but he has been so encouraging.

41:57.622 --> 41:59.364
And especially with the bird artist.

41:59.444 --> 42:03.250
I mean, his review of that was just so helpful.

42:03.270 --> 42:03.370
Yeah.

42:04.328 --> 42:08.394
You were with Summit originally, which was with Soberman, I guess.

42:08.414 --> 42:08.514
Yeah.

42:08.534 --> 42:11.799
Did you know a fellow by the name of Ted Wiesner who was with Soberman?

42:11.819 --> 42:14.403
I don't know him personally, but I know his work very well.

42:14.423 --> 42:15.545
I did a piece.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.830
I'm also going to publish his weekly interviews now.

42:18.850 --> 42:19.131
Are you?

42:19.812 --> 42:23.878
And I did a piece on him for Pete Evans in a couple months ago.

42:23.898 --> 42:24.859
What a nice, nice book.

42:24.979 --> 42:31.850
I haven't read the new novel, but I'll tell you a novel that I truly, truly know.

42:32.291 --> 42:33.272
That I like, too.

42:33.539 --> 42:34.500
The True Detective.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.503
Scared the hell out of me.

42:37.523 --> 42:40.606
But I should tell you, the story of how that came to me is quite a story.

42:40.746 --> 42:41.166
It is.

42:41.547 --> 42:41.847
It is.

42:41.947 --> 42:44.209
Because it started out in non-fiction.

42:44.369 --> 42:45.710
And you never got the killer.

42:46.011 --> 42:47.712
It was an amazing book.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.054
It really shook me.

42:49.374 --> 43:00.404
I found it on the, sort of, the emotional import it had for me was on, was commensurate to a solutioner's song.

43:00.865 --> 43:03.327
It made me, it just made me play.

43:04.083 --> 43:08.430
Some books make you feel the world is a little predatory.

43:08.831 --> 43:17.045
They always have publicists.

43:17.626 --> 43:20.210
I think that's good.

43:20.391 --> 43:28.825
I can ask you, would you inscribe these?

43:28.885 --> 43:30.107
Sure.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.703
Andrew, there isn't anything we've missed.

43:33.723 --> 43:35.355
If you want, we could talk on the phone.
