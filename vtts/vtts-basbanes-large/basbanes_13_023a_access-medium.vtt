00:02.663 --> 00:16.440
Louise Taper called me and told me you'd be in New York at the Swan Hill and you'd look me up.

00:16.800 --> 00:22.247
Tell me a little bit, how do you judge Louise as a collector of Lincoln?

00:22.267 --> 00:32.299
Louise is probably the foremost woman collecting Lincoln and one of the foremost collectors of Lincoln.

00:32.633 --> 00:59.535
and is probably the foremost woman collector of lincoln of all time wow is she a tough lady no she's extremely generous she's very bright and she can make up her mind in a hurry and she has a husband who is really a co-collector with her who encourages her well he seems to have come to it by her enthusiasm she has but he's

00:59.735 --> 01:23.835
he's got the collector's instinct for other things so that he understands her yeah and she has a fantastic collection and she's built it intelligently and that everything she buys fits into whatever else she has it isn't random purchases it's to round out the story her material on booth she has the certainly the greatest private collection of material on mary lincoln

01:24.068 --> 01:27.638
She's done a superb job and a very intelligent job.

01:27.658 --> 01:30.185
But it seems to me she's very competitive, though.

01:30.325 --> 01:32.290
I mean, if it's something she wants.

01:32.310 --> 01:34.496
Well, every collector is competitive.

01:34.516 --> 01:35.158
If you aren't,

01:35.307 --> 01:36.529
You don't collect.

01:36.549 --> 01:40.696
I said to her, I said, has there ever been anything that you really wanted that you didn't get?

01:40.716 --> 01:42.118
And she said, what an interesting question.

01:42.138 --> 01:42.679
And he says, no.

01:42.779 --> 01:42.939
No.

01:43.099 --> 01:50.191
I mean, sure, there have been things that have gone, you know, gone through the roof where the price is outrageous and she's not foolish.

01:50.651 --> 01:53.977
But if she wants something, she's willing to go for it and stretch a bit.

01:54.738 --> 01:57.923
And she has got a, she does her research.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.497
She is not playing by ear.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.141
She can read the notes.

02:02.281 --> 02:04.126
She studies the subject.

02:04.146 --> 02:05.489
She's not an accumulator.

02:05.509 --> 02:07.514
There are a lot of people who buy just to have it.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.442
She buys to have and to study it.

02:10.542 --> 02:11.485
And she loves the books.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.650
They're part of her family.

02:13.630 --> 02:20.858
She said an interesting thing to me, like she's within five letters of catching up with other collectors like Barrett, for instance.

02:20.898 --> 02:24.622
She seems to have set as models for herself the achievement.

02:24.642 --> 02:29.608
She's for Oliver Barrett, you know, the fellow that... Oh, I bought 80% of the Barrett's sale.

02:29.628 --> 02:30.549
I should know about it.

02:31.029 --> 02:32.972
I was the biggest buyer in that sale.

02:33.012 --> 02:33.392
Really?

02:33.532 --> 02:36.596
Did that surprise you that that collection could broken up?

02:36.616 --> 02:37.376
The Barrett collection?

02:37.396 --> 02:37.737
Yeah.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.600
I offered to buy the collection.

02:41.356 --> 02:44.700
And I offered more than a Bronte auction.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.422
They thought they would get more at auction.

02:46.843 --> 02:48.064
And what did you want to do with it?

02:48.805 --> 02:50.748
I would have broken it up.

02:51.028 --> 02:52.470
I'll talk to you after the sale.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.713
We're going to go back.

02:54.733 --> 02:55.614
Okay, go on.

02:55.894 --> 03:02.122
Okay, and I'll give you a call.

03:02.923 --> 03:04.465
Okay, can I be fired?

03:04.525 --> 03:07.269
I just wonder how you feel right now, Kevin.

03:07.349 --> 03:10.873
I feel very happy about the fact that this world was a big success.

03:11.225 --> 03:15.389
Besides the fact that it brought in a lot of money, apparently, it created a lot of business.

03:15.409 --> 03:20.774
And a lot of people, one of the things I cared about, a lot of people got books that they wanted to own.

03:20.854 --> 03:23.197
This lady who bought the features powder plant.

03:23.277 --> 03:24.378
I said, are you selling this?

03:24.398 --> 03:26.039
She said, oh no, it's not what those would mean.

03:26.059 --> 03:27.581
That was a nice answer.

03:27.601 --> 03:29.383
Also, yeah, she said that.

03:29.723 --> 03:32.085
Also, it's nice for this one house.

03:32.165 --> 03:37.030
I mean, they put a lot of work at Upway into this, and it's been a happy sale for them.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.876
in terms of their 50th anniversary.

03:40.377 --> 03:42.120
So everybody's happy all around.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.825
How do you feel about seeing these friends of yours?

03:45.026 --> 03:53.382
Looking at the books, you know, where you can see them all in one glance, I said to George, I said, with strong temptation, I said,

03:53.632 --> 04:02.320
But once the diaries pass, I'm very happy and I'm very glad that they're going back in circulation.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.703
That meant a lot to me.

04:04.723 --> 04:07.986
I have a lot of stories here today which book dealers do.

04:08.226 --> 04:14.812
For example, John Schiller bought me the Swinburne, I don't know if you noticed it, at an auction in London years ago.

04:14.992 --> 04:18.275
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

04:18.355 --> 04:19.977
Horowitz, who bought it today,

04:20.108 --> 04:25.295
I turned around, and when I told him that, he said I would be underbitter at that auction in 1972.

04:25.555 --> 04:26.517
That's a long time ago.

04:26.537 --> 04:28.860
How long have you been collecting this book?

04:28.880 --> 04:29.821
Since the middle 50s.

04:30.302 --> 04:31.904
So what does that make it?

04:31.964 --> 04:32.885
Almost 40 years.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.109
Was the decision to step one to sell the books?

04:36.330 --> 04:38.132
No, the time it arrived.

04:38.272 --> 04:38.713
I'm getting old.

04:39.013 --> 04:45.482
I'm 74 years old, and my kids and wife wouldn't know what to do with the books if they were stuck with them.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.685
So I thought I'd better do it while I'm still alive.

04:48.003 --> 04:53.149
And as I've said a couple times, I could use nobody in my retirement.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.471
So we'll have some fun.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.635
What was the general focus of the collection?

04:57.655 --> 05:00.338
It became a completely Catholic collection.

05:00.358 --> 05:06.285
I started out with the science fiction books.

05:06.606 --> 05:13.094
Not only true science fiction, but Time Machine, Jekyll and Hyde, Kinetic and J.G., all of that kind of stuff.

05:13.494 --> 05:16.558
Had a complete run of everything Edgar Rice Burroughs ever wrote.

05:16.808 --> 05:19.191
I mean, gradually got into high spots.

05:19.772 --> 05:27.242
You know, landmark books like Wealth of Nations and Origin of Species and Blackstone's Commentaries and others, you know, all of that sort of thing.

05:27.843 --> 05:29.144
I was excited there.

05:29.164 --> 05:30.326
A famous book there.

05:30.546 --> 05:31.628
Boy, I'm trying on it.

05:32.228 --> 05:33.570
There are two I missed out on.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.032
I never got to in Austin.

05:35.733 --> 05:42.462
Every time I was ready to spend what it cost for something like Pride and Prejudice, the price had gone three notches beyond what I was...

05:42.509 --> 05:44.572
A Tale of Two Cities, I never thought.

05:44.592 --> 05:46.375
That also kept going ahead of me.

05:46.455 --> 05:48.979
Now, I noticed a few of the things that you have that I have.

05:49.059 --> 05:54.627
Now, I have a wonderful Uncle Tom's cabin, and I was really excited to be here.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.029
Mine isn't wonderful.

05:56.049 --> 05:57.011
Mine is a nice package.

05:57.031 --> 06:04.902
I got mine out of a Cape Cod collection, really, for $500, believe it or not, from a dealer about five or six years ago.

06:04.922 --> 06:06.505
You know, it's one of the great ones.

06:06.525 --> 06:09.029
But again, it's a classic book.

06:09.049 --> 06:11.352
I never had any one author except Burroughs.

06:11.551 --> 06:12.292
I don't think.

06:12.893 --> 06:13.614
Complete.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.137
Now, why Burroughs?

06:15.197 --> 06:17.681
Because Tarzan was my boy and the girl.

06:17.761 --> 06:19.764
So I have everything that Burroughs ever rose.

06:19.824 --> 06:21.066
Still have the stars to see.

06:21.086 --> 06:21.607
No, no, no.

06:21.627 --> 06:22.569
They're all here.

06:22.609 --> 06:23.150
Three of them.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.093
Three of them went yesterday afternoon.

06:25.874 --> 06:27.377
But there's lots more.

06:27.537 --> 06:28.538
There's lots more.

06:30.441 --> 06:32.665
Look, there's 6,000 books here.

06:32.645 --> 06:38.979
And they've auctioned, what, now $500, and $4,000, maybe another couple hundred.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.965
There's over $5,000 books still in there.

06:42.867 --> 06:45.332
I'm afraid that you picked swans.

06:45.412 --> 06:47.557
Oh, that was interesting.

06:47.577 --> 06:52.307
I always thought that 50s and Sotheby's were the classic.

06:52.287 --> 06:57.154
And when Swan spoke to me, I said, look, what Andrew has said, I'm going to put you in the same category.

06:57.615 --> 06:58.356
And he said, you're right.

06:58.997 --> 07:02.903
He said, but that means that for us, your books will be a very important item.

07:03.424 --> 07:10.214
He said, they'll do a good job for you, but it won't be nearly the significance to them with a multi-million dollar payment.

07:10.234 --> 07:11.977
He said, for us, he said, it'll be a big deal.

07:12.017 --> 07:14.320
We'll make it our 50th anniversary.

07:14.781 --> 07:15.822
I'm happy for him.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.269
What's really exciting about book collecting is that

07:20.519 --> 07:22.181
This is about a million-dollar sale.

07:22.602 --> 07:24.104
Over $2 million, I think.

07:24.204 --> 07:26.146
And it's great for the book.

07:26.467 --> 07:32.815
But now you talk about Christie's last fall, November, they sold the Gutenberg for $2 million, and that was not considered a lot.

07:32.855 --> 07:40.185
What I'm saying in terms of books, the beauty of books is that one book can be $2 million and not a lot.

07:40.405 --> 07:43.589
A library can be $1 million, and it's tremendous.

07:43.910 --> 07:46.273
It's kind of a cute little thing.

07:46.490 --> 07:48.452
So there's no misgivings?

07:48.793 --> 07:49.694
No, no, no.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.237
I'll be interested to see what happens with the rest of the books.

07:52.257 --> 08:00.746
I mean, not so much in terms of money, but in terms of how they go, if people really want them, if there's a spirited bidding problem.

08:00.806 --> 08:02.629
How did you enjoy the books?

08:02.689 --> 08:04.030
Now, these were in Chicago.

08:04.150 --> 08:09.557
We had a couple of books all over the house, but we had one room with stacks in it, you know?

08:09.577 --> 08:12.260
And we had like four stacks, and you could walk between them.

08:12.280 --> 08:16.024
And then I got a couple more stacks, and we had a walk like this to get between them.

08:16.375 --> 08:19.338
And my wife was very glad to get it all out of there.

08:19.358 --> 08:19.739
She was?

08:20.139 --> 08:21.221
She had no pressure on you.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.402
Well, I thought of the thing I told you.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.384
I used to read catalogs in bed at night.

08:24.805 --> 08:30.331
And I said, my gosh, here's a book I paid 50 bucks for, and this dealer wants $3,500.

08:30.692 --> 08:31.653
And she had one answer.

08:31.773 --> 08:32.113
No.

08:33.395 --> 08:34.676
So she finally got her wish.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.259
I got a collector by the name of DeCourcy Failed.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.862
He died a number of years ago.

08:39.903 --> 08:42.045
But he was a famous New York collector.

08:42.211 --> 08:46.520
And he went into David Kirchenbaum, who's now 98, who I've interviewed for this question.

08:46.540 --> 08:47.863
And he said, Dave, you've got to help me.

08:47.883 --> 08:50.108
And my wife said, either you go or the books go.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.673
And so they gave him to NYU.

08:52.693 --> 08:53.856
They're all not NYU.

08:53.896 --> 08:55.098
That's what I didn't want to do.

08:55.199 --> 08:57.604
That's what I didn't want to do.

08:57.644 --> 08:58.345
This is Dave.

08:58.365 --> 08:59.207
1,000,242.

08:59.963 --> 09:01.806
That's before 10% or after?

09:01.846 --> 09:03.768
That's the hammer.

09:03.788 --> 09:07.814
No, there's errors and there's mistakes.

09:07.854 --> 09:09.576
That's the apparent hammer price.

09:09.597 --> 09:10.998
That's the hammer price.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.325
We may have posted somebody's bid wrong or something.

09:15.465 --> 09:17.908
I hope you didn't post the potter's wrong.

09:17.968 --> 09:22.995
Potters are probably... We'll be off by a couple hundred dollars.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.958
How do you feel?

09:24.938 --> 09:34.172
Thanks, Larry.

09:34.270 --> 10:00.531
...to absolute auction, you have to put cash on the barrelhead with 10 days notice.

10:00.511 --> 10:04.015
And David Combsville did 2.0, period.

10:04.155 --> 10:05.897
So there was an auction price?

10:05.957 --> 10:07.439
Where was the auction?

10:07.459 --> 10:08.981
In a lawyer's office.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.563
In LA?

10:10.803 --> 10:12.165
Were you bidding?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.447
I tried to put together money.

10:14.688 --> 10:17.331
I wanted to put up two and a half million dollars.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.252
Did Ricky bid, you know?

10:18.272 --> 10:18.372
No.

10:18.672 --> 10:19.253
Nobody bid.

10:19.533 --> 10:25.320
There was one bid.

10:25.925 --> 10:48.017
this isn't like i'm having lunch uh april 30th 1992 a lovely little italian restaurant on third avenue i stopped on my way home from the swan's tail and uh i'm meditating here i have my notebook but indulge me for a second

10:49.921 --> 10:58.249
Bill Shitey spends close to $2 million for a 36-line Bible known as a Liverpool Bible, Gutenberg-type.

10:59.670 --> 11:01.512
People say he stole it.

11:02.332 --> 11:03.173
He got it for nothing.

11:04.394 --> 11:05.835
Should have gone for much more than that.

11:05.896 --> 11:09.038
That was in November, which is just four months ago.

11:10.179 --> 11:18.527
Today, the 50th anniversary sale of Swan Galleries, I was talking to Mr. Epstein, who had...

11:18.676 --> 11:22.962
Consigned all the books this one.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.225
Hold on.

11:25.245 --> 11:35.418
I'm halfway through my homemade linguine with baby cherry stones, beautiful shrimp and scallops, garlic and basil with a nice tomato sauce.

11:36.840 --> 11:43.689
But anyway, before we thought, the parts.

11:43.709 --> 11:48.295
So shoddy spent a $2 million for the Gutenberg 36-line battle.

11:49.068 --> 11:53.993
It's 1.24 at hammer price, so another 10%.

11:54.133 --> 12:00.160
Everybody just found it, and how wonderful this sale is for 500 books.

12:00.180 --> 12:09.790
That's a tremendous success, and it's a little more than half what Chatty sends, and that's a disappointment.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.112
Not a disappointment, but a bargain.

12:12.714 --> 12:16.898
That's the beauty of books, I think, in a way.

12:19.223 --> 12:21.806
is that the merits can be anything.

12:24.248 --> 12:26.030
It can be $2 million for one book.

12:26.050 --> 12:28.813
It can be a million and a quarter for 500 books.

12:30.154 --> 12:37.581
But they're important and the people collect them and that they're precious to the people who buy them.

12:37.601 --> 12:44.368
I'll tell you what really excites me about this sale is that I'm looking for a way out of the book.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.391
When I even proposed this,

12:47.692 --> 12:49.794
before even it was bought by Random House.

12:50.855 --> 13:04.849
We were talking about Richard Manny, the new buyer, the new guy on the block, the mystery buyer, the anonymous buyer, the guy who had bought the Poe Tamerlane, and then later who bought the four folios of Shakespeare at the Garden Sale.

13:04.869 --> 13:07.472
Well, now, as we speak today, the man is bankrupt.

13:08.353 --> 13:14.779
He's being chased by his creditors, and he owes millions of dollars.

13:15.029 --> 13:22.681
Not only has he sold his book collection, but his 700 paintings are now in jeopardy of being attached and sold as well.

13:24.003 --> 13:28.370
And then, at today's sale, we have a woman, Joan Hill from California.

13:29.151 --> 13:34.600
Nobody knew who the hell she was, and she dominated the sale.

13:35.341 --> 13:41.230
If it's a million two, this gal easily spent two or three or four hundred thousand dollars.

13:41.330 --> 13:42.572
I truly don't know.

13:43.902 --> 13:45.084
Out of the woodwork.

13:45.444 --> 13:47.167
Out of the woodwork.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.292
And so people come and go.

13:51.154 --> 13:52.035
The books go on.

13:54.719 --> 14:03.914
When we started this book, the guy that was new and the kid on the block is now not only old, but gone.

14:06.658 --> 14:08.982
We have a new one here who emerged today.

14:10.497 --> 14:17.483
In fact, she emerged so quickly that she won't even be in the Maine Antiques Digest because the person who was reporting for that publication wasn't here.

14:18.064 --> 14:20.046
And she did not even buy that heavily yesterday.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.710
So Joan Hill arrives as a big player.

14:26.331 --> 14:29.614
On the scene, Steve Massey was there giving her his card.

14:30.835 --> 14:36.480
And Lou Weinstein comes over sucking up from Heritage Books.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.323
Three saying, who is this guy but that

14:39.607 --> 14:44.734
There's a line there, and Butch Cassidy says, who are these guys, Butch?

14:44.755 --> 14:45.916
Who is she?

14:45.936 --> 14:46.637
She's a new one.

14:47.158 --> 14:48.380
She's a woman, which is nice.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.444
I talked to Ralph Newman, incidentally, along Louise Tabler.

14:52.085 --> 14:56.011
And yet, so, the new one who was supposed to be the new one is not only dead, but gone.

14:56.031 --> 15:06.306
We have a new one, and yet the old one, who is discounted, who is Bill Shady, is not only there, but is preeminent.

15:07.585 --> 15:10.628
Think about this somehow when you come to write that final chapter.

15:11.289 --> 15:14.231
When you meditate and you indulge yourself in a few imponderables.

15:15.072 --> 15:18.776
One of the imponderables is the people coming out of what to go on.

15:19.136 --> 15:19.336
Thanks.

15:20.718 --> 15:22.039
And that is Nick Out.

15:22.820 --> 15:27.604
And here we are on 3rd Avenue at 81st in New York City.

15:27.624 --> 15:28.865
I just listened to this thing.

15:28.885 --> 15:29.746
I think I liked it.

15:32.649 --> 15:33.610
And...

15:35.564 --> 15:36.525
This is important.

15:36.585 --> 15:37.486
I'm thinking now.

15:37.587 --> 15:53.687
How do you end a book which in some respects is episodic and why you disdain the encyclopedic approach where we have this collector, that collector, this collector, that collector, and this collector.

15:53.707 --> 15:54.168
Interesting.

15:54.228 --> 15:55.770
You want a narrative.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.011
You want a story.

15:57.051 --> 16:02.398
You want to tell something that's interesting and which engages your reader.

16:03.475 --> 16:05.758
And so you want a beginning and a middle and an end.

16:05.778 --> 16:08.823
This is what we tell kids who are trying to write stories.

16:10.345 --> 16:16.815
You have a beginning, and you fatten it up with a middle, and you fly out of there with an out, an end.

16:18.758 --> 16:27.972
And I think why I'm so pleased today and why I just indulged myself in a sinfully expensive but just decidedly wonderful dinner.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.318
Lunch, actually, because it's only 3.15 in the afternoon.

16:34.424 --> 16:35.666
It's because I think I've got it.

16:37.589 --> 16:38.370
I think I have it.

16:41.194 --> 17:02.946
I think particularly when we come to the second half of the book, where we start with To Have and To Have No More, what we have there is a meditation on the 80s with particular focus on Haven Om War and a garden sale.

17:03.584 --> 17:10.053
What we say is, reader, hey, reader, you missed something.

17:12.297 --> 17:21.470
There was a sale in November of 1989, and it only got two paragraphs in the New York Times, two lousy little paragraphs, and you missed it.

17:22.612 --> 17:23.393
Well, listen to me.

17:23.413 --> 17:24.114
Sit with me.

17:24.735 --> 17:25.937
I'm going to tell you what happened.

17:28.060 --> 17:32.967
And what happened is astounding and fascinating and quite fascinating.

17:34.786 --> 17:47.700
If you focus as a microcosm of the book world, the comings and the goings, and it really is endemic of what went on in the 80s.

17:47.720 --> 17:57.711
And then we go on and we identify and we talk about our people and we go to Texas and we do our collective chapters, which I now foresee to be two.

17:58.572 --> 18:01.435
And then we have a California chapter, which is kind of nice.

18:01.887 --> 18:04.391
And then we have our aberration, which is Stephen Blumberg.

18:04.411 --> 18:05.893
And then we have to find a way out.

18:06.334 --> 18:14.707
And I think the way we find our way out is to have a chapter that combines both Richard Manning and the sale here today.

18:14.747 --> 18:16.409
Epstein gave me a couple of quotes.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.391
He said, give him a call.

18:19.995 --> 18:21.838
I will give him a call, perhaps.

18:22.959 --> 18:29.329
But I don't think it's necessary because I think I have him for 10 minutes on this tape that we're listening to right here.

18:31.233 --> 18:38.600
and the kinds of things that he said are interesting, but not terribly revelatory.

18:39.281 --> 18:53.094
I did like his perception, his sense, his sense that, gee, if I stay here long enough, I might just pack them up and take them with me.

18:53.795 --> 18:59.400
And that does resonate, doesn't it, from the John Hill Burton story,

18:59.701 --> 19:28.375
or the priest or the friar or whatever the hell it was that he was consigns his books to the sale and he's sitting there he's sitting there in the gallery and he is so overcome at the sight of these books of his which are being sold that he goes out and he masquerades as a military officer or whatever and he comes back and he starts buying books well that didn't happen today but what Mr. Epstein said

19:29.992 --> 19:31.954
does recall that incident, I think.

19:33.416 --> 19:42.267
And whether or not we introduce it here, whether or not we introduce it here, or whatever in the book remains to be seen.

19:43.609 --> 19:46.052
The whole thing comes down to structure and how we're going to do it.

19:47.013 --> 19:58.547
But I have to say for this tape, and I don't know if anybody besides myself is ever going to listen to it, but if you do, I've enjoyed this enormously.

19:58.882 --> 20:02.387
It's been the defining moment of my professional life.

20:03.770 --> 20:04.631
It's been quite wonderful.

20:06.794 --> 20:15.488
And as we speak, I'm on 96th Street trying to get onto the FDR North.

20:15.508 --> 20:26.745
As my friend Brian Higgins and I used to say, we were at that spot where I could take a right and go to Atlantic City and shoot crap or continue left and go home.

20:27.637 --> 20:30.159
pick up the Triborough Bridge and go home.

20:30.179 --> 20:32.641
And what I'm doing here is going home.

20:35.003 --> 20:37.706
And the traffic seems to be picking up as well.

20:39.307 --> 20:40.948
So now we're looking at the East River.

20:43.430 --> 20:57.002
And there's, opposite with an A, I think, there is an appropriateness to the fact that this is the first audio meditation I've done for this book.

20:59.378 --> 21:22.922
It's appropriate that I do it in New York City, where only God knows how many times I've come here over the last 10 years to give books A New Life at the Strand, either that or to research the book, which I'm now completing for independence.

21:24.607 --> 21:29.452
In any case, New York is important to me.

21:29.472 --> 21:30.133
I love this damn city.

21:31.795 --> 21:40.064
As I speak to this, I am looking at wrecked cars that have been savaged, cannibalized, and left for it.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.306
They're only dead by their bones.

21:42.326 --> 21:44.729
They look like carcasses.

21:44.749 --> 21:45.910
Not even carcasses.

21:45.930 --> 21:50.395
The skeletons built in the Serengeti that have been devoured by the big cats.

21:50.881 --> 21:56.387
and the bones are glistening in the sun.

21:56.447 --> 22:01.013
I always have used my father, John Bazmanes, when he drove down there.

22:01.393 --> 22:08.782
I think he came, if only to see these cars by the side of the road.

22:10.264 --> 22:11.825
Well, I've enjoyed this.

22:11.845 --> 22:16.391
This has been kind of fun, and perhaps it was therapeutic.

22:17.172 --> 22:19.234
And if some listener at some point

22:19.990 --> 22:22.433
and the future listens to this.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.336
Well, it's been a ball.

22:25.757 --> 22:27.179
It's 30 April, 1992.

22:27.299 --> 22:35.148
If you're looking for a date, we may have identified it at the beginning of the tape.

22:35.168 --> 22:36.170
I truly don't know.

22:37.771 --> 22:48.985
And now I'm coming up on the exit 17, Triborough Bridge, Buckner Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, Toll Bridge, and let's go home, my friend.

22:49.842 --> 22:56.128
We may get back to you presently, if not to Nick Bazmanes.

22:56.148 --> 22:57.790
Out.

22:57.810 --> 23:07.260
Let's also say that I started up this morning not particularly pleased that I was coming to New York for a variety of reasons.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.663
One, that I would rather be home writing.

23:10.683 --> 23:15.708
And I wasn't overly thrilled about coming down.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.651
I was just listening to Peggy Lee, and this is my song on the radio.

23:19.357 --> 23:39.812
And yet, coming to the fair today was kind of like getting a sense of the vital signs, feeling the pulse, looking in the pupils of the eye,

23:40.349 --> 24:09.748
looking at the complexion feeling what's going on out there and taking a little bit of it and infusing it into the work in progress because you can't just sit down there in a goddamn hole and write the fucking book without you're from on the pulse of what's happening and I don't know what the next book will be and God willing this book will be good

24:09.948 --> 24:21.890
and successful, and well received, and perhaps even make a statement that people 50 or 100 years from now might even want to pay attention to it.

24:22.111 --> 24:22.552
We'll see.

24:23.253 --> 24:27.621
I won't be around.

24:27.641 --> 24:31.669
100 years from now, God willing, my children will be around.

24:32.610 --> 24:33.492
But if not,

24:33.742 --> 24:43.795
You know, maybe some grandchildren that I may or may not hear who knows.

24:43.815 --> 24:51.765
But if people listen to tapes at some point in the future and they like my book, it always is what we have to say.

24:51.785 --> 24:55.009
I think this was a pretty important, I think it was the defining name of the book.

24:55.029 --> 25:01.597
Because what I've been working on all this time, I think now has a scope.

25:01.617 --> 25:03.259
It has a scope and it has a shape.

25:03.863 --> 25:07.758
It certainly has a beginning, and right now what I see is the end.

25:08.903 --> 25:10.549
Thank you, and out.
