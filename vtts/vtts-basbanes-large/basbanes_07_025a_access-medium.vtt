00:03.288 --> 00:18.505
I'm not necessarily any expert on it, and it doesn't have anything to do with my general field, but I think it's interesting is when you look at the whole history of Book Collective and what people could get out of it in terms of building great libraries and so on, it's really been shrinking, the opportunities.

00:19.566 --> 00:32.400
You know, you looked at what Arthur Houghton did for Harvard, and you got a library, and then you look at what Mary Hyde put in, and she got a suite for a hell of a lot more money, and probably a much better donation in terms of the quality and so on.

00:32.549 --> 00:36.633
There are a lot of opportunities out there, but it is very much a shrinking thing.

00:36.693 --> 00:39.556
And when you look at what... Shrinking opportunities.

00:40.797 --> 00:42.499
You mean in terms of material that's available?

00:42.539 --> 00:42.739
Right.

00:42.819 --> 00:46.382
In terms of building this kind of library, really shrinking.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.884
And people generally not doing it.

00:48.524 --> 00:55.351
Humanities Research Center down there was... People criticized it at the time for the way they did it.

00:55.371 --> 00:57.613
I'm doing a chapter on this, by the way.

00:57.633 --> 00:59.074
I don't want to be naive about this.

00:59.094 --> 01:01.797
This is one of the reasons I'm here today, too, because I...

01:02.350 --> 01:05.555
I don't mean to interrupt, but I want to be honest with you, too.

01:05.735 --> 01:08.499
I understand you have some feelings about how they did it at the beginning.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.541
Go ahead.

01:09.561 --> 01:13.226
Well, I think that I was no part of it.

01:13.246 --> 01:17.012
I was a small dealer, and I went to see Warren Roberts.

01:17.032 --> 01:18.675
Who I interviewed, by the way.

01:18.695 --> 01:19.095
Oh, I don't know.

01:19.115 --> 01:21.799
We're not talking maybe like mid-'60s, something like that.

01:21.819 --> 01:23.502
I interviewed him three weeks ago in Texas.

01:23.522 --> 01:28.189
And he told me that they really just couldn't be bothered doing small dealers.

01:28.844 --> 01:53.586
and uh they really they dealt with one dealer yeah yeah if i wanted to sell them anything i should sell it to lou feldman and they would think about that what is that what were your feelings about that obviously i didn't like it uh did you suspect anything improper no i i mean whether improper is that you've got public money uh and and how it's how it's being

01:53.836 --> 01:57.099
Ron Roberts suggested that you sell to Lou Feldman?

01:57.219 --> 01:58.300
Yeah.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.446
Well, just because he said he couldn't be bothered, you know, looking at all these small offers from small dealers.

02:04.466 --> 02:09.710
That he just didn't have the time for that, that it really had to filter through one person, and Lou Feldman was their agent.

02:10.031 --> 02:15.255
He also said at the time that their financing was a real problem, and that they were like a couple of years behind.

02:15.315 --> 02:16.897
You know that Lou gave him credit.

02:16.977 --> 02:22.662
Yeah, and that if I sold stuff to Feldman, Feldman could pay me, and then Feldman would wait for the money.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.302
So there was merit to it.

02:24.402 --> 02:26.585
I don't know, you know, behind the scenes at all.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.386
I have no knowledge.

02:27.866 --> 02:36.017
And I'm not, by the way, I can say this straight out, I'm not alleging any criminal wrongdoing there.

02:36.077 --> 02:42.204
I've looked hard, and I'll be very honest with you, but it's a hell of a story.

02:42.344 --> 02:50.775
Yeah, I mean, it was the way it was done, and I think also Texas created a lot of animosity because Feldman was not a popular character.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.653
Charles Hamilton, who I spoke with Monday.

02:53.693 --> 02:57.057
Did you ever read the indictment he wrote?

02:57.077 --> 02:57.557
Oh, I did, yeah.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.779
Hamilton shoots his mouth.

02:59.079 --> 02:59.500
All right.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.881
Now, I confronted him on this.

03:01.422 --> 03:04.766
Now, let's say with the tape, because it's on tape.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.729
He wrote this in 1981.

03:07.869 --> 03:12.455
And if these people were alive, they would have such a libel suit against him.

03:12.735 --> 03:16.460
I mean, what he alleged was, I don't know if you recall it, he didn't even allege it.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.321
He said it, yeah.

03:17.561 --> 03:20.965
That Ransom and Feldman got together.

03:21.518 --> 03:34.395
They bought worthless junk at low prices and sold them to the University of Texas, and they both died millionaires as a result of the money that they stole from the University of Texas.

03:34.416 --> 03:35.777
Now, that's crazy.

03:35.938 --> 03:41.004
And I asked him, point blank, Monday, nice guy, by the way, but Hamilton Blash.

03:41.565 --> 03:42.226
Great interview.

03:42.587 --> 03:43.328
Great interview.

03:43.348 --> 03:50.277
He didn't even want to kind of, I mean, I finally had a, this never happens, normally I'll stick with people the way they want to go.

03:51.185 --> 03:54.610
I said, I'm really interested in this, in the source of this information.

03:54.670 --> 03:55.932
I said, you don't cite any facts.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.535
You don't say what they bought for how much.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.598
And I said, what's your source for this?

04:00.719 --> 04:01.460
How do you know this?

04:02.321 --> 04:06.907
And he said, now this, I appreciate you keep this to yourself for the moment.

04:07.428 --> 04:10.172
He said, well, I'm very friendly with Luke Goldman's secretary.

04:11.494 --> 04:13.236
And I said, could you give me his or her name?

04:13.617 --> 04:16.681
And he said, no, she's with Rec Moose now, and she won't talk.

04:16.701 --> 04:20.787
And I said, well, she has made some very serious charges.

04:21.526 --> 04:25.151
I think that they should be, you know, if they're true, let's put them on the record.

04:25.171 --> 04:29.417
If they're not, anyway, he said he's going to talk to the woman, maybe the woman will talk to me.

04:29.437 --> 04:33.263
But that's the source for that indictment.

04:33.723 --> 04:44.339
But that was a feeling that people had, because Luke Feldman was the exclusive agent for Texas, that a lot of other legitimate dealers like yourself were kind of shut out.

04:45.120 --> 04:45.220
Yeah.

04:45.240 --> 04:50.267
And, well, they also bought from Francis Himmel at Himmel and Barker, and Margie Cohn,

04:50.855 --> 04:52.257
House of Books in New York.

04:52.337 --> 04:53.519
All these people are dead now.

04:55.382 --> 05:00.531
Terry Tanner runs Hamill and Barker, and he worked for the girls, they were called.

05:00.571 --> 05:02.974
Hamill and Barker were two women.

05:03.015 --> 05:03.636
He worked for them.

05:03.716 --> 05:04.317
They were the girls.

05:04.357 --> 05:06.881
I thought Rostenberg and Stern were the girls.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.143
These are the Chicago girls.

05:08.664 --> 05:10.446
Hamill and Barker.

05:10.667 --> 05:11.548
They're dead?

05:11.568 --> 05:12.730
They're both dead, yeah.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.533
And Terry Tanner is...

05:15.003 --> 05:17.045
worked for them and now runs the business.

05:17.306 --> 05:17.726
Where is he?

05:18.007 --> 05:19.528
In Chicago, Evanston, actually.

05:19.548 --> 05:20.510
I've been going to Chicago.

05:20.530 --> 05:23.333
Evanston, Illinois.

05:23.353 --> 05:23.573
Okay.

05:24.054 --> 05:26.837
And I'd call him and see if, you know, if he's got it.

05:26.857 --> 05:28.820
And he might have no knowledge of any of this stuff.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.280
You never know.

05:30.201 --> 05:30.902
From those days.

05:30.922 --> 05:32.404
This is called networking here.

05:32.644 --> 05:35.267
See, I mean, there's a lot of sense to some of this.

05:35.608 --> 05:38.171
Now, I mean, you look, I've got a, I have a very big client.

05:39.012 --> 05:41.375
I just want to make sure we're going.

05:41.395 --> 05:44.198
Who filters anything he buys from other dealers through me.

05:44.679 --> 05:44.959
Okay.

05:45.479 --> 05:50.044
And I mean, in terms of just giving him advice, we take care of all his cataloging.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.305
We do all his research.

05:52.387 --> 05:53.988
He likes our standard of research.

05:54.329 --> 05:58.493
So if you buy something from an auction house, he sends it to us.

05:59.414 --> 06:00.936
We all have it deacidified.

06:01.036 --> 06:02.117
We make cases for him.

06:02.137 --> 06:03.339
We take care of his whole collection.

06:05.581 --> 06:06.402
That can make sense.

06:06.442 --> 06:07.583
We offer a lot of service.

06:07.603 --> 06:12.208
I would think that the other side of this is you've got Feldman who could finance what they were doing.

06:12.709 --> 06:13.630
You've got Feldman.

06:13.812 --> 06:23.508
who could go out and, I don't know, go to the Powys family in England, make them a cash offer on the spot, may not get paid for two years, maybe triples his money.

06:23.628 --> 06:26.634
But I don't think there was really anybody else who could pull it all together.

06:27.315 --> 06:28.336
And look what they did.

06:28.517 --> 06:28.897
Yeah.

06:28.917 --> 06:29.839
That's the key thing.

06:29.979 --> 06:34.727
In the end, and I remember sitting in somebody's office, probably with Deckard.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.291
I think it was with Deckard Turner.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.814
He's a tough big one guy.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.335
He's something.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.056
If you could get him.

06:40.306 --> 06:41.508
Well, I think I can.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.811
I mean, he makes a wonderful statement.

06:43.831 --> 06:45.112
He's like Hamilton, you know.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.534
Well, except that he's accurate.

06:48.256 --> 06:53.063
But in the end, Decker told me that he'd been going over what they spent in Carlton Lake.

06:53.223 --> 06:56.467
And over what they've been spending.

06:56.487 --> 06:58.350
They spent $21 million and $22 million.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.271
Look what they got.

06:59.932 --> 07:02.235
In the end, nobody's... You mean that's all they spent?

07:02.255 --> 07:02.875
Oh, whatever they spent.

07:02.895 --> 07:04.658
One period of time, he was telling me.

07:04.938 --> 07:08.503
But in the end, they got a fantastic opportunity.

07:08.943 --> 07:10.125
It'll never happen again.

07:10.145 --> 07:10.245
Okay.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.438
Never happened again.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.421
And if they overpaid for some stuff, so what?

07:13.822 --> 07:17.527
I think that a lot of what went on was that Feldman was not a popular person.

07:17.627 --> 07:18.949
He wasn't a pleasant person.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.411
He was pretty obnoxious.

07:20.432 --> 07:21.413
It's true.

07:21.593 --> 07:24.838
Everything that people tell me is pretty consistent.

07:25.138 --> 07:26.861
Yeah, I mean, you look even at his catalogs.

07:27.201 --> 07:31.668
One of his catalogs, and this was all stuff that he had sold for Texas, and he listed it all in the catalog.

07:32.069 --> 07:35.874
But at the end of the catalog, the last page says the total value of everything in this catalog.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.435
1.9 million.

07:36.455 --> 07:39.760
Yeah, and then he had, and his ads always used to say quality.

07:39.892 --> 07:44.801
Which Hamilton said, and it's almost anti-Semitic, by the way.

07:44.861 --> 07:52.694
I mean, he said, my wife, Diane, wonders if this was, if he was trying to be classy or if he was saying quality with the English accent, you know.

07:52.714 --> 07:54.718
He said that in print, you know?

07:55.299 --> 08:01.630
Oh, another guy you had to talk to then is, you know, I didn't think of this as Feldman's assistant is around, Bart Auerbach.

08:01.863 --> 08:03.325
He worked for film for years.

08:03.485 --> 08:03.725
Bart?

08:04.046 --> 08:04.526
Auerbach.

08:04.606 --> 08:06.068
A-U-R-B-A-C-A.

08:06.088 --> 08:06.969
And in red, huh?

08:07.009 --> 08:07.911
Is he in New York, you think?

08:08.011 --> 08:10.574
Yeah, you reach him through Christie's book department.

08:10.594 --> 08:12.236
He's a special consultant to Christie's.

08:14.419 --> 08:15.840
That's worth the whole trip, right?

08:15.860 --> 08:16.381
Yeah.

08:16.401 --> 08:18.624
I mean, he worked for, he worked for, he didn't like him much.

08:19.865 --> 08:21.688
I wonder if he's the source.

08:22.809 --> 08:24.932
I don't, I don't think the source is accurate, honestly.

08:24.992 --> 08:26.353
No, no, because that's, there's nothing.

08:26.814 --> 08:27.194
Listen, I'm.

08:27.214 --> 08:30.098
Hamilton, Hamilton, uh, it's just, shut the fuck up.

08:31.073 --> 08:31.734
Yeah.

08:31.794 --> 08:32.414
Oh, yeah.

08:32.434 --> 08:34.617
I mean, I have to think about something.

08:34.637 --> 08:37.820
I think that they... We're talking why people?

08:38.060 --> 08:42.605
Yeah, I think that they could get to the point where there's nothing else to add, and they're not really enjoying it anymore.

08:42.625 --> 08:47.129
That the pursuit is an important part of it, and the putting it together.

08:48.130 --> 08:52.855
And having a stagnant collection doesn't appeal to a lot of people.

08:55.417 --> 08:59.762
Paul Richards, a colleague of yours, as a collector, and he's that way.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.063
He said, for him, it's just getting it.

09:01.583 --> 09:06.088
And once he has it, he loses interest in it, and then he gives it to Fawcett University, I guess.

09:06.108 --> 09:07.650
Yeah, he's given two collections.

09:07.710 --> 09:08.811
You're a collector, too, right?

09:08.831 --> 09:09.051
Yeah.

09:09.832 --> 09:10.793
I really like this stuff.

09:11.975 --> 09:12.715
That's important.

09:13.877 --> 09:25.550
In books, I don't know if it applies to autographs and manuscript stuff, but you generally, you think twice about, no, I'm phrasing this wrong.

09:25.570 --> 09:27.692
A lot of dealers don't collect themselves.

09:27.732 --> 09:31.236
It's a stat with a statement, because maybe some clients think, well, help.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.460
he's keeping the best stuff for himself.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.401
Do you ever run into that?

09:35.443 --> 09:35.743
Oh, yeah.

09:35.783 --> 09:36.764
Into that kind of perception?

09:36.844 --> 09:40.329
I do not show many collectors my collection.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.011
They don't even know it exists.

09:42.492 --> 09:43.293
And that's important.

09:43.733 --> 09:44.555
Absolutely.

09:45.055 --> 09:51.163
Because you can show people stuff that they can't have, and what you can't have is always more desirable than what you can have.

09:52.164 --> 09:57.031
They feel that you're in competition in a particular area, and they're never going to buy anything great from you.

09:57.051 --> 09:59.434
To even become more cynical, they might think that

10:00.460 --> 10:07.289
you're going to drive the price up, too, because, well, I mean, Rosenbach used to say, well, if you don't buy it, I'll keep it for myself.

10:07.530 --> 10:11.836
In other words, make the price so dear that they won't buy it, so that you can keep it.

10:12.036 --> 10:14.259
But I never offered the stuff.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.582
Would you like it?

10:16.762 --> 10:17.804
I caught World War II.

10:18.204 --> 10:19.586
That's a very active election.

10:20.768 --> 10:21.148
Everything.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.733
I mean, I caught every kind of propaganda issued by everybody.

10:25.895 --> 10:26.736
Why?

10:27.237 --> 10:28.999
It interests me tremendously,

10:29.300 --> 10:38.331
how average decent people dealt with the world at war, with the fact that you had to go kill people or be killed, or that you were being bombed.

10:38.952 --> 10:44.378
I mean, psychologically, how did people deal with this and still stay, you know, decent people?

10:45.119 --> 10:46.841
And that's how the whole thing started.

10:46.881 --> 10:49.044
I started collecting World War II propaganda posts.

10:49.084 --> 10:51.487
Did you see Carl Russell's book, his recent book?

10:51.647 --> 10:52.628
No, I don't think so.

10:52.648 --> 10:55.432
Oh, Jesus, the book on World War II, and it was all about propaganda.

10:55.452 --> 10:56.934
It's from Oxford University Press.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.075
I'll send you a title.

10:58.409 --> 11:00.372
It's all about this, I mean, perception.

11:00.932 --> 11:01.133
Really?

11:01.153 --> 11:02.675
What people said and what people said.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.096
Oh, I would really appreciate that.

11:04.116 --> 11:05.979
It was just published a couple months ago.

11:06.019 --> 11:07.020
I did an interview with him.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.102
No, I've not seen that.

11:08.362 --> 11:09.904
Just write it down here.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.087
I would appreciate that.

11:12.147 --> 11:12.347
Yeah.

11:12.848 --> 11:17.314
And I've got a huge collection of all the different kinds of propaganda issued during the war.

11:17.674 --> 11:20.277
All kinds of black propaganda.

11:20.297 --> 11:22.700
The hateful stuff.

11:23.542 --> 11:26.205
I'm thinking of a chapter on this.

11:26.658 --> 11:29.202
Who collects the hateful stuff?

11:29.763 --> 11:32.647
Not because you agree with it in any way.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.009
You may even be appalled by it.

11:34.149 --> 11:36.292
I'm sure you are in many instances.

11:36.313 --> 11:40.218
But to collect it also, not only because it interests you, but because it has to be preserved.

11:40.639 --> 11:51.035
I think of the, I refer to the Lessing Rosenwald purchase of the Simon of Trent document, which he said that's the only case in his, time in his life he told Rosenbach, price is no object.

11:51.756 --> 11:54.640
But he bought it because he didn't want it to stay in the hands of the Nazis

11:54.923 --> 11:55.964
because they would misuse it.

11:55.984 --> 12:02.432
It was about the sacrificial killing of children by Jews back in the 30s, very, very anti-Semitic.

12:03.173 --> 12:07.678
He beat out the Nazis, and he gave it to the historical center here in Waltham, and they sold it.

12:07.698 --> 12:10.301
He wanted them to keep it forever, so it was a little bit of a scandal.

12:10.321 --> 12:11.963
Remember that case two or three years ago?

12:11.983 --> 12:15.707
It sold for $165,000 and finally went to Yeshiva.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.269
But my point is,

12:18.160 --> 12:20.283
The true collector doesn't just acquire.

12:20.363 --> 12:24.449
The true collector also is instrumental in preserving the product of human thought.

12:24.469 --> 12:30.638
That's a lofty statement, but that is a thought that goes through my book.

12:30.658 --> 12:33.582
Well, this very much goes through my whole World War II collection.

12:33.602 --> 12:39.170
I mean, for one thing, nobody else has collected this, and no one else has collected it on the scale that I've collected it.

12:39.230 --> 12:40.652
It's never interesting to me now.

12:42.334 --> 12:45.619
I mean, I just bought the other day a complete run of the picture post,

12:46.257 --> 12:48.099
which is like the Life magazine of London.

12:48.359 --> 12:49.660
How about Nazi stuff?

12:49.680 --> 12:50.861
I don't have much.

12:51.882 --> 12:58.247
I have Nazi leaflets dropped on Allied soldiers, lots of that kind of stuff, if I can find it.

12:58.267 --> 13:07.556
I mean, I buy all the German propaganda stuff, but not stuff from the 30s, not so much the political stuff of the Nazis, as much as just what they used during the war.

13:09.998 --> 13:15.683
And in terms of autograph material, there's not a lot of good stuff around, but I have a lot of good stuff.

13:15.763 --> 13:16.163
I mean, I have

13:16.649 --> 13:22.057
I have Eisenhower's letter to his wife, written on June 9th, about how the landings are not.

13:22.697 --> 13:28.045
And then one of the most incredible coincidences ever, I have Rommel's letter to his wife on the same day.

13:28.125 --> 13:28.426
Jesus.

13:29.247 --> 13:30.128
The same day.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.450
Where did you find these?

13:31.470 --> 13:34.454
Two completely different on each coast.

13:34.474 --> 13:35.335
One on each coast.

13:35.355 --> 13:35.636
Really?

13:35.756 --> 13:41.644
I'm telling a guy in Los Angeles, I bought this Eisenhower letter from my... He reaches in his desk drawer and takes out the Rommel letter.

13:41.894 --> 13:42.695
So you had to have it.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.677
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.219
The price went up, I'll bet, instantly.

13:45.259 --> 13:45.880
I'm not sure.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.022
It's a high price.

13:47.723 --> 13:49.666
But I mean, it's just fantastic.

13:49.947 --> 13:52.311
You pay a premium when you betray your hand, aren't you?

13:52.371 --> 13:54.855
Well, you never expect anybody to come up with something like that.

13:55.175 --> 13:58.480
I've got a lot of very, very great manuscript material from World War II.

13:58.500 --> 14:05.792
But the concept is, there is a real concept here that this is a subject that nobody has collected.

14:06.194 --> 14:08.817
It's a real ground floor kind of collection.

14:08.937 --> 14:12.761
I mean, I set the tone and everything else, but what I collect, I'm not interested in memoirs.

14:12.861 --> 14:14.442
I don't collect stuff written after.

14:15.063 --> 14:24.572
I'm more interested in the ephemera that nobody has saved, not books, but the pamphlets, what to do when your house is bombed, all the blitzkrieg kind of stuff.

14:24.612 --> 14:32.320
Well, this whole box, this is just, I have an agent in England who works for me, go to flea markets, give an idea of...

14:34.730 --> 14:37.413
I honestly don't know what the hell this stuff is.

14:37.433 --> 14:43.159
This is a box full of stuff that just came in yesterday, and it just buys all kinds of stuff.

14:43.179 --> 14:46.062
At what point do you know what stuff you're going to sell and what you're going to keep?

14:46.462 --> 14:49.445
I don't have any plans of selling any of it.

14:50.166 --> 14:50.826
Okay.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.109
German Submarine, 1939.

14:53.149 --> 14:55.651
This is all, presumably all English.

14:55.691 --> 14:58.654
National Baghdad to Beirut, 1944.

14:58.754 --> 15:03.319
So there'll be more propaganda on how well they've been fighting patrols.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.815
These are silk map shoes by some pilots that went down.

15:08.578 --> 15:12.945
Phrase books, 1941, German phrase books.

15:12.965 --> 15:13.707
This just came in?

15:13.767 --> 15:15.349
Yeah, just this stuff just arrived yesterday.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.311
Did you like it?

15:17.012 --> 15:18.355
Oh, it's fascinating.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.978
I mean, so you're pleased with this stuff.

15:19.998 --> 15:20.659
Oh, yeah.

15:20.679 --> 15:21.220
I mean, this stuff.

15:21.240 --> 15:21.981
You like this stuff.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.123
I haven't gone through this.

15:23.243 --> 15:24.185
This I take home.

15:24.245 --> 15:25.828
You're going through this now for the first time?

15:25.848 --> 15:25.948
Yeah.

15:26.587 --> 15:27.789
Map reading for the home guard.

15:27.809 --> 15:29.071
A lot of home guard stuff interests me.

15:29.131 --> 15:32.156
You've got a bunch of old people trying to defend English from an invasion.

15:32.256 --> 15:33.158
It's unbelievable what they do.

15:33.178 --> 15:41.811
You know how much fun my project is, I have to say this with the machine running, because just three weeks ago today, under similar circumstances, I was in Princeton, New Jersey with Bill Scheide.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.895
You know, Mr. William Scheide?

15:43.975 --> 15:44.536
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:44.556 --> 15:52.088
And it was just he and I, and he goes over and takes out a table, not unlike this, and he takes out his Gutenberg Bible, and he says, here, feel it.

15:52.456 --> 15:54.159
But he was showing the same enthusiasm.

15:54.279 --> 15:56.523
And this, again, is the collective, the collective.

15:56.543 --> 16:03.034
He has this, regardless of what the, you know, the Goodwood Bible is not available to anyone else, but this is.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.759
So I think there's a difference.

16:05.779 --> 16:10.287
I mean, I can see the difference of a Paul, Paul Rich's, right, don't from the beginning.

16:10.527 --> 16:16.337
And Paul, he is the kind of guy who gets it and then loses interest.

16:16.604 --> 16:19.228
And that it is the putting together.

16:19.248 --> 16:21.170
I like, I mean, I'm enjoying putting together.

16:21.190 --> 16:29.461
I have a Western collection that's very stagnant now, of books, as well as manuscript material, that I wouldn't consider getting rid of, but I don't add to it.

16:29.481 --> 16:34.848
I don't find manuscripts anymore, Western manuscripts, that are significant enough to add.

16:35.750 --> 16:42.098
And books at this stage in the Western field, I'm actually one of the odd people who actually reads these books.

16:42.118 --> 16:44.361
The shoot collector knows his collection.

16:44.401 --> 16:45.683
That's another thesis of mine.

16:45.899 --> 16:47.822
I'm not interested in the false collector.

16:48.503 --> 16:55.034
I mean, I took a whole bunch of Overland journals, manuscript journals, as well as the guidebooks of the Overland Trail.

16:55.054 --> 16:57.157
I drove the Oregon Trail one summer.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.581
That was incredible.

16:59.722 --> 17:01.765
And I bet you know where to lay your hands on everything, too.

17:02.285 --> 17:05.749
I mean, you don't need to catalog, I mean, I'm sure you catalog it.

17:05.769 --> 17:07.772
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I mean, I know the stuff, you know.

17:08.052 --> 17:20.689
But I mean, I thought it was fabulous to take this stuff and to start in Independence, Missouri, and drive to the Oregon Trail with the guidebooks and reading the descriptions and, you know, and here's this journal I've had of this guy and where he camped out and what they did.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.010
It's fantastic.

17:22.030 --> 17:26.997
I mean, like, the high point was a guy and his family had his journal in Kansas.

17:27.437 --> 17:30.441
They carved their name on a rock, and the rock was there.

17:30.721 --> 17:31.262
No kidding.

17:31.664 --> 17:36.390
This does give you a sense of communing with history.

17:36.971 --> 17:37.191
Yeah.

17:37.211 --> 17:41.797
I think part of the kick out of collecting is... There are two kinds of collectors.

17:41.817 --> 17:46.243
There's the collector, more than two, but there are certainly two major kinds.

17:46.263 --> 17:56.716
The guy who is checking stuff off, who is putting sets together, who is gathering stuff, in part for the sake of gathering it.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.018
The accumulator.

17:58.038 --> 17:59.460
Yeah, I wouldn't want to...

17:59.693 --> 18:02.918
Well, we're not talking about anybody in particular.

18:03.098 --> 18:04.641
There are people who are accumulators.

18:05.182 --> 18:06.864
Thomas Phillips was an accumulator.

18:07.185 --> 18:11.531
And then I think there are people where the collection's a real living collection.

18:12.994 --> 18:15.958
And it's just not filling shelves.

18:16.299 --> 18:24.672
It's just not a matter of accomplishing, assembling the collection.

18:25.073 --> 18:30.120
A guy's a very big client of mine who buys on large scale.

18:31.001 --> 18:36.949
And he told me one time that he had just spent the weekend just while he was home alone for the weekend.

18:36.969 --> 18:38.611
It was in an enormous house.

18:38.631 --> 18:41.195
And he has framed autographs that tell every place.

18:41.215 --> 18:42.857
He said it was like walking through history.

18:42.877 --> 18:46.121
I mean, he gave me, I felt like saying, my God, I wish I could tape record this.

18:46.822 --> 18:54.793
I mean, this is the most, I mean, he said it was the most unbelievable experience at how much he enjoys this collection, how much he gets out of it.

18:54.993 --> 18:56.655
That's what I love in collectors.

18:57.497 --> 19:00.080
You know, people that it's really living, active.

19:01.502 --> 19:04.707
By the way, tell me, we can pick up again on this another time.

19:05.028 --> 19:06.790
In fact, I think we're going to have to.

19:06.910 --> 19:07.972
Yeah, I think it's really worthwhile.

19:08.012 --> 19:09.174
I'll stay the quarter to 12.

19:09.694 --> 19:10.876
I'll say another half hour is it.

19:11.297 --> 19:12.038
Well, that's fine.

19:12.098 --> 19:12.899
I don't want to push it.

19:12.919 --> 19:13.660
No, that's okay.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.925
I can push it off.

19:16.945 --> 19:23.835
And some of these articles that I read, which are very good, by the way, you mentioned somebody on the West Coast, a major collection down in La Jolla.

19:24.237 --> 19:25.358
David Carpels?

19:25.378 --> 19:26.739
Yeah, he's in Santa Barbara.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.500
Santa Barbara.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.282
Is this somebody I should see, do you think?

19:29.642 --> 19:32.025
Yeah, he is the biggest manuscript collector.

19:32.085 --> 19:35.688
Well, he's one of the biggest, but he's the most publicly the biggest.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.810
And he'd be really worth my while.

19:37.850 --> 19:38.291
I don't know.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.893
I think you ought to try talking on the telephone.

19:44.157 --> 19:51.544
He's so cagey with dealers that I don't know what you get out of him.

19:53.667 --> 19:57.011
Before I started mentioning him to people, I asked if it was all right to mention him.

19:58.773 --> 19:59.634
He said okay, right?

19:59.654 --> 20:00.234
Yeah, he did.

20:00.274 --> 20:07.202
And it was funny, because I ran into his wife in Los Angeles right after the Town & Country thing came out.

20:07.222 --> 20:08.764
And she said, oh, you know, thank you.

20:08.784 --> 20:13.129
She said, and she said, Dave was so embarrassed, you know, that, I mean, you said anything about his mansion.

20:13.590 --> 20:16.092
I said, you know, I said, come on, Masha.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.236
I said, my God, I said, your house is absolutely unbelievable.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.653
Oh, I know it's a mansion.

20:21.033 --> 20:24.018
But he really doesn't appreciate that it's a mansion.

20:24.038 --> 20:25.340
Well, what's the source of the income?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.041
Real estate.

20:26.622 --> 20:28.925
But they have a library, too, apparently.

20:28.945 --> 20:30.748
Yeah, he bought the estate across the street.

20:30.768 --> 20:33.291
And it's a library that's open to scholars?

20:34.453 --> 20:34.773
Yeah.

20:35.174 --> 20:38.339
I mean, it's open at the will of Dave Coppolis, I think.

20:38.359 --> 20:39.060
Is he Greek?

20:40.161 --> 20:40.902
No, I'm Greek.

20:40.922 --> 20:41.183
I don't know.

20:41.203 --> 20:41.703
I'm just curious.

20:41.723 --> 20:42.685
I'm just looking for a way.

20:42.985 --> 20:44.207
I haven't gone out to the West Coast.

20:44.227 --> 20:45.469
I know he's got Bill Self.

20:45.489 --> 20:46.130
You know who he is?

20:46.150 --> 20:46.911
William Self.

20:47.110 --> 20:49.213
Yeah, he's an old line collector.

20:49.233 --> 20:53.799
Do you think the difference, what you'd find, I would bet, really, in talking, and I'm not knocking Bill South.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.000
I mean, I know him.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.082
I just met him for 10 minutes.

20:56.102 --> 20:56.763
Yeah, he knows me.

20:56.783 --> 20:57.303
I know him.

20:57.884 --> 21:02.270
And I was impressed that he flew east to buy the Tamerlane, you know.

21:02.290 --> 21:02.530
Yeah.

21:02.550 --> 21:03.071
I like that.

21:03.131 --> 21:03.832
I kind of like that.

21:03.852 --> 21:04.132
Yeah.

21:04.412 --> 21:14.325
But I think that a lot of those guys, you might find, are who will tell you that the reason that they want something is because it's rare, because it's a first.

21:15.146 --> 21:16.028
Well, it's a high spot.

21:16.128 --> 21:16.288
Yeah.

21:16.308 --> 21:16.408
Yeah.

21:16.642 --> 21:21.869
Dave Karpolis, where he's collecting manuscript material, has to make individual decisions on everything.

21:22.409 --> 21:29.578
And he'll tell you that he bought this because politically this thought, you know, resulted in all this, you know, kind of stuff.

21:29.599 --> 21:39.611
I think you get, generally with manuscript collectors, since the criteria are very different, you're not just collecting sets, you're not just, you know, unique items.

21:39.691 --> 21:42.175
Yeah, and so they have to make, you have to make unique decisions.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.117
You have to make a decision in each case.

21:44.418 --> 21:47.242
as to what you're going to buy.

21:47.322 --> 21:54.533
I think that you'd find... I don't have a lot of empathy for the guys watching high spots.

21:54.573 --> 21:56.716
I mean, it just doesn't turn me on.

21:59.801 --> 22:00.522
Like Dick Manning.

22:01.123 --> 22:01.924
You know Dick Manning?

22:02.344 --> 22:02.465
Yeah.

22:02.485 --> 22:03.626
I had a good Dick last week.

22:03.907 --> 22:04.668
Interesting guy.

22:04.788 --> 22:05.890
Yeah.

22:07.732 --> 22:10.496
I mean, you know, he should do what he wants for this money.

22:11.318 --> 22:13.581
He's been collecting for seven years.

22:14.438 --> 22:19.227
He started collecting because he always had this vision of a class of life.

22:19.447 --> 22:21.130
It started from the other way.

22:21.290 --> 22:22.633
I've never seen it.

22:22.653 --> 22:26.019
He wanted the library first, and then the items to fill it.

22:26.039 --> 22:27.040
Very interesting, isn't it?

22:28.323 --> 22:33.372
And he watched this and that, and Jane Fiverr, and the Shakespeare's.

22:33.392 --> 22:36.858
Two million dollars is a lot of money for that.

22:36.878 --> 22:38.100
Two million he paid.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.255
I got the Tamerlane for 200, but for my purposes, he's excellent.

22:41.435 --> 22:42.115
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:42.135 --> 22:43.136
Because he hasn't been written in love.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.758
He's brand new, you know.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.340
Yeah, he represents all, I mean, those are the new people.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.444
Have you tried to get an interview with Haven O'Moar?

22:52.725 --> 22:54.627
I've been waiting to ask you about him.

22:54.647 --> 22:58.130
I'll just check this out.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.011
All I know about him is more social.

23:00.031 --> 23:01.052
We're talking about Haven O'Moar.

23:01.473 --> 23:03.655
Everybody has met Haven O'Moar socially.

23:03.815 --> 23:05.016
Everybody.

23:05.036 --> 23:07.378
Bill Scheide had dinner with him.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.895
And I said, do you remember how this got together?

23:09.975 --> 23:14.620
He thought it was through plumbing, you know, because I guess he bought a lot of stuff from plumbing.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.982
Ricky Jay, the magician.

23:16.022 --> 23:17.604
I did an interview with Ricky Jay.

23:18.084 --> 23:20.867
As you can see, you've talked to just about everybody.

23:20.887 --> 23:22.289
No, I've talked to Nick Barker.

23:22.309 --> 23:25.232
I've talked to, I mean, it's going to be a nice book.

23:25.252 --> 23:28.596
And I write, if I may say so, good interesting stories.

23:29.177 --> 23:30.198
Let's talk about Haven O'Moore.

23:30.238 --> 23:33.602
Everybody's got a Haven O'Moore story.

23:33.717 --> 23:35.440
acquire things for him at all?

23:35.460 --> 23:36.742
I had no business connection.

23:36.762 --> 23:40.047
It was just a very funny thing that when I first met Haven O'Moore, I didn't know what he looked like.

23:40.668 --> 23:49.102
And I was at a wedding reception, and the person who was getting married, the groom said to me that Haven O'Moore was going to be there.

23:49.122 --> 23:50.724
He wanted to introduce the two of us.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.026
Did you know who he was prior to that?

23:52.086 --> 23:53.729
I just knew he was a coming collector.

23:54.450 --> 23:57.174
And it was Arthur Freeman's wedding, Arthur Freeman at Quaritch.

23:57.295 --> 23:59.438
I'm seeing him in two years.

23:59.738 --> 24:02.200
Funny thing was, at this wedding... What a small world.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.101
I don't know anybody.

24:03.202 --> 24:04.843
Even when was it Arthur Freeman's wedding?

24:04.863 --> 24:04.963
Yeah.

24:05.103 --> 24:10.008
When married Janet Ingram, who was former... No, this is one of the... at least one marriage back.

24:12.171 --> 24:14.053
Arthur's been around a bit.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.875
And it was at a reception after they got married.

24:17.456 --> 24:23.522
And I was talking to this couple, and I can't remember what we were talking about.

24:23.602 --> 24:26.085
Skiing and all kinds of different things.

24:26.105 --> 24:27.366
And Arthur comes over and he says,

24:27.667 --> 24:29.712
Oh, Haven, I'm so glad that you met Ken.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.161
And it was like suddenly Haven of More changed totally.

24:35.845 --> 24:36.627
It was really funny.

24:36.707 --> 24:38.571
I wasn't this anonymous person anymore.

24:38.872 --> 24:39.774
But how many changed?

24:40.055 --> 24:41.778
Well, he was much more cautious.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.803
More cautious when he knew who you were?

24:43.823 --> 24:43.963
Yeah.

24:44.284 --> 24:45.066
What was he like prior?

24:45.086 --> 24:45.186
Yeah.

24:45.520 --> 24:49.786
I think we were talking about skiing and talking about various... You talked about skiing?

24:49.806 --> 24:52.711
You know, it was just a real interesting, you know, outgoing kind of guy.

24:52.771 --> 24:56.376
I mean, are you familiar at all with the Institute of Traditional Science and all that stuff?

24:56.396 --> 24:57.498
You've never heard of that before?

24:57.658 --> 24:57.838
No.

24:59.321 --> 25:00.783
What he was going to build in Cambridge?

25:01.163 --> 25:01.364
No.

25:01.564 --> 25:05.049
No, I didn't know any of that kind of stuff.

25:05.089 --> 25:07.513
Did you know that he had a partner by the name of Michael Davis?

25:07.533 --> 25:09.536
Well, I mean, yeah, I knew it after the fact.

25:09.857 --> 25:10.297
After the fact.

25:10.337 --> 25:11.940
Nobody knew he had a partner before the fact.

25:11.960 --> 25:12.861
I knew nothing about him.

25:13.330 --> 25:23.383
I heard the story, and I don't remember who told me, that somebody who knew him well said to him that someone had done a background check on him and that he had no background.

25:23.804 --> 25:24.845
True.

25:24.865 --> 25:27.008
I'm as good a detective as anybody is.

25:27.929 --> 25:28.570
Go ahead.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.533
And he said, don't you understand my name?

25:30.993 --> 25:31.754
Have no more.

25:32.115 --> 25:32.616
He said that?

25:32.716 --> 25:34.178
Yeah.

25:34.238 --> 25:35.800
It's the title of my chapter, by the way.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.661
Have no more.

25:38.383 --> 25:39.925
Beautiful, isn't it?

25:39.945 --> 25:40.926
I don't know who told me that.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.088
It could have been Arthur Freeman.

25:42.389 --> 25:43.850
He has no history.

25:43.931 --> 25:45.913
He comes to us full-blown out of the 1950s.

25:46.994 --> 25:49.576
Did you read the Sotheby's catalog?

25:49.897 --> 25:50.938
Not really.

25:51.578 --> 25:53.000
I heard that it was off the wall.

25:53.020 --> 25:55.342
Take some time, sometime, and read it.

25:55.362 --> 26:02.489
And not just the thing at the front, but the biographical blurb at the back, with a bust of himself, as he produced.

26:03.470 --> 26:08.836
And he claims kinship with the famous Celtic king, Avon O'Moore, of the ninth century.

26:08.856 --> 26:11.198
He claims kinship with Sir Thomas More,

26:11.920 --> 26:15.864
and Stonewall Jackson, but he never tells you where he was born.

26:16.985 --> 26:18.607
I don't know where he was born.

26:18.627 --> 26:20.970
I don't know if or where he went to school.

26:23.572 --> 26:29.779
People suggest CIA connections, new identity, but that he comes to us full-blown out of the 1950s.

26:29.799 --> 26:34.564
That's the fact that Jackson had no history as far as I can see.

26:35.004 --> 26:36.186
I don't need all this.

26:36.206 --> 26:40.290
When I met him, what struck me was, I mean, he was just a guy that you run into at a reception,

26:40.490 --> 26:44.214
And you're talking, you know, and I can't remember, we were talking about health foods and all different kinds of stuff.

26:44.234 --> 26:45.115
He was relaxed.

26:45.155 --> 26:46.356
Was he interested in health foods?

26:46.376 --> 26:46.656
Yeah.

26:46.816 --> 26:49.479
Did you know anything he was saying about yoga and stuff like that?

26:49.499 --> 26:49.659
No.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.762
If he did, I didn't pay any attention.

26:52.142 --> 26:53.343
It didn't mean anything to me.

26:53.363 --> 26:54.524
But he was very relaxed.

26:54.725 --> 27:01.512
And then the minute Arthur said, well, this is Ken Rendell, you know, it just took on a whole different thing.

27:01.632 --> 27:02.953
I mean, he was more formal.

27:03.293 --> 27:04.034
Where was this wedding?

27:04.815 --> 27:06.657
The wedding was, I don't know where the wedding was.

27:06.677 --> 27:08.879
This was a reception in Boston.

27:08.899 --> 27:09.600
It was in Boston.

27:09.620 --> 27:09.720
Yeah.

27:10.426 --> 27:11.227
Okay.

27:11.247 --> 27:13.089
At Arthur's mother's house in Belmont, actually.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.772
Did he mention anything about his villa in Acapulco?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.294
I don't remember.

27:17.574 --> 27:19.316
Frankly, I never liked him.

27:19.636 --> 27:24.221
We were at a reception, and he outrageously chased my wife around and really pissed me.

27:24.241 --> 27:24.822
Haven did?

27:24.842 --> 27:24.942
Yeah.

27:25.883 --> 27:28.426
And, I mean, apparently, I mean, there was a wife sitting there.

27:28.446 --> 27:29.667
Did you meet Lorea, his wife?

27:30.288 --> 27:30.488
Yeah.

27:30.528 --> 27:31.289
Nice woman.

27:31.309 --> 27:31.609
Yeah.

27:31.629 --> 27:33.051
Did you know he wrote poetry?

27:34.412 --> 27:36.795
I don't really know an awful lot about it, guys.

27:36.815 --> 27:38.457
Have you talked to Priscilla Jubeles?

27:38.477 --> 27:38.577
Yeah.

27:39.603 --> 27:41.706
We were at a dinner party at Priscilla's one night.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.308
They went out with him socially, actually.

27:43.509 --> 27:44.090
Yeah, I know.

27:44.270 --> 27:48.015
And we didn't know that Haven and his wife were coming to dinner.

27:48.035 --> 27:49.678
You had dinner at Priscilla's house?

27:49.738 --> 27:50.178
Yeah.

27:50.198 --> 27:54.004
And I said Priscilla, I said, if I knew that Haven was coming, I wouldn't have come.

27:54.024 --> 27:54.565
No kidding.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.588
And that's why he just gets drunk and he gets obnoxious.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.409
He does get drunk.

27:57.830 --> 28:02.296
Did you know he was going to build this great library in Cambridge?

28:02.536 --> 28:03.958
No, I didn't know anything about him.

28:03.998 --> 28:04.920
Shut this up.

28:04.940 --> 28:06.903
I just didn't know anything about him.

28:06.923 --> 28:07.804
We had high spots.

28:08.037 --> 28:10.400
Extraordinary stuff, though.

28:10.420 --> 28:10.521
Yeah.

28:10.921 --> 28:15.047
Not really looking for stuff that is my kind of stuff.

28:15.067 --> 28:17.851
Did he ever ask you if you had anything that might be interesting?

28:17.891 --> 28:22.759
No, he asked me to look at a book that was annotated by Thomas Jefferson one time.

28:22.779 --> 28:23.700
Did you go to his house?

28:24.201 --> 28:24.942
I can't remember.

28:24.962 --> 28:25.983
No, it didn't go to his house.

28:26.003 --> 28:27.285
I can't remember whether he brought it by.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.767
He never let people in his house.

28:29.188 --> 28:29.789
Did you know that?

28:30.089 --> 28:32.473
I heard that kind of thing, the people who showed up there.

28:32.813 --> 28:34.696
Brattle Street, was it?

28:35.157 --> 28:37.420
Actually, from Krause.

28:37.788 --> 28:39.290
when they were delivering the Shakespeare's.

28:41.093 --> 28:43.297
The guy, they really wanted to see what he had.

28:43.317 --> 28:45.981
And he knocked the door and he asked if he could use the men's room.

28:46.021 --> 28:49.867
And the guy said, there's a gas station around the corner.

28:49.887 --> 28:53.874
Somebody else, who I won't name because you know him, was in the house.

28:53.894 --> 28:56.618
I said, there's no furniture in there.

28:56.638 --> 28:57.860
No furniture to sit down.

28:58.281 --> 28:59.683
Because I said, there's more people in there.

28:59.703 --> 29:00.785
The books were never kept there.

29:00.885 --> 29:03.829
They were kept in bank vaults, two bank vaults in Boston.

29:03.850 --> 29:05.432
Yeah, no, because I had a bank vault there, too.

29:05.750 --> 29:09.895
And it shook up the deal one time when I said, gee, that was a nice sale you made to Haven.

29:09.915 --> 29:10.436
And I was like, what?

29:11.357 --> 29:13.099
I mean, you're supposed to really be kept quiet.

29:13.199 --> 29:13.740
God damn it.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.682
You know, he must have been drunk and told you about this.

29:15.702 --> 29:17.965
And I just let it go just for a few minutes.

29:18.005 --> 29:18.626
I said, no, no.

29:18.646 --> 29:19.226
I said, listen.

29:19.246 --> 29:21.309
I said, I'm in the same bank he's in.

29:21.329 --> 29:22.931
I said, and they wheeled all these crates.

29:23.111 --> 29:23.472
Yeah.

29:23.912 --> 29:24.973
What bank was your name?

29:25.033 --> 29:25.774
Boston Bank.

29:25.794 --> 29:26.095
Yeah.

29:26.255 --> 29:27.396
Safety Department.

29:27.416 --> 29:27.777
Safety Department.

29:27.797 --> 29:28.758
Safety Department.

29:28.938 --> 29:29.259
What is it?

29:29.299 --> 29:30.280
Is it like a big loan?

29:30.320 --> 29:30.780
Yeah.

29:30.901 --> 29:34.525
Well, I mean, what you have are, his stuff is frequently just left in crates.

29:35.129 --> 29:43.241
But it's a big room with a lot of safes in it, vaults, and you can rent individual vaults inside of it, inside their main vault.

29:43.381 --> 29:48.609
Did you know there was a big lawsuit in Cambridge that went on between he and Davis?

29:48.769 --> 29:49.711
Yeah.

29:49.731 --> 29:53.576
Yeah, because the attorneys called and asked if I'd be interested in doing an appraiser.

29:53.596 --> 29:55.799
I mean, I had to say I couldn't appraise books.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.023
I'm not in the book business.

29:58.043 --> 29:58.624
Which side?

29:58.664 --> 29:59.926
Is it Davis' side?

30:00.186 --> 30:01.027
Yeah.

30:01.087 --> 30:03.170
Which is Hale and Boer.

30:03.190 --> 30:04.292
They've impounded the case.

30:05.572 --> 30:09.997
I asked to see it, and the judge wouldn't let me see it.

30:10.617 --> 30:11.758
She had it in her office.

30:11.778 --> 30:13.901
I said, well, come on, it's a public record.

30:14.321 --> 30:17.324
And she wouldn't let it, and I wrote to her superior.

30:17.344 --> 30:19.106
It's a very interesting story that's going on.

30:19.126 --> 30:23.711
This could be my New Yorker song, I think, by the way.

30:23.731 --> 30:25.873
Then, meanwhile, I copied the docket.

30:27.995 --> 30:28.676
I went back on it.

30:29.837 --> 30:30.938
How does that sound, by the way?

30:31.340 --> 30:31.961
That chapter.

30:32.241 --> 30:35.106
Oh, yes, that's fascinating.

30:35.226 --> 30:37.169
But Arthur may know more about him.

30:37.630 --> 30:37.790
We will.

30:37.810 --> 30:39.933
I'm going to see also Colin Franklin.

30:40.053 --> 30:44.039
Yeah, but I think Arthur really knows.

30:44.059 --> 30:44.941
I'll have to call Arthur.

30:45.001 --> 30:45.722
This is Friday.

30:46.423 --> 30:46.663
Shit.

30:47.104 --> 30:52.031
You better, and I'll tell you with Arthur, plan on two or three... Hours?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.153
...times.

30:54.415 --> 30:58.040
Arthur can... He's never frowned in the morning.

30:58.962 --> 30:59.743
You've seen him in London.

31:00.010 --> 31:08.219
I'm seeing him in London, but Dick Manning told me he's coming for the Martin sale, and Dick buys a lot of stuff, and he said, we'll have dinner together.

31:08.239 --> 31:14.586
So I know that if I only get him late, if I only get an hour or so out of him in London, I'm going to get him when he comes to New York.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.529
What we just try to do is kind of get him in front of him late in the day, go to a bar.

31:18.029 --> 31:19.611
Late in the day at Forge.

31:19.631 --> 31:19.911
Yeah.

31:20.272 --> 31:21.773
I understand he's a big Red Sox fan.

31:21.913 --> 31:22.354
Oh, yeah.

31:22.394 --> 31:23.856
It's a brand new book.

31:23.876 --> 31:25.617
Maybe I'll just bring it as a present.

31:25.918 --> 31:29.882
This guy is a Red Sox fan on the scale that he will call Arthur Birchbaum

31:30.571 --> 31:31.892
Arthur, I've interviewed by Larry.

31:32.112 --> 31:38.158
And ask Arthur to put the phone down by the radio so that he can sit in his office in London and listen to the whole game.

31:39.199 --> 31:45.124
Who's paying the merch?

31:45.144 --> 31:45.985
That's a great story.

31:46.546 --> 31:54.053
I had dinner with Arthur in Charlotte, and I was in their library, and he took out this book and put it in my lap.

31:55.194 --> 31:58.857
Gorgeous, illuminated, book of hours.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.802
And he said, yeah, it's beautiful, but that's not, he said, look at the inscription.

32:03.123 --> 32:04.946
There was an inscribed book from Henry VIII.

32:05.628 --> 32:07.411
Are you familiar with this book that he has?

32:08.653 --> 32:12.360
To Margaret Pole, I guess, who later was beheaded or something.

32:13.663 --> 32:15.046
You know, and you've seen Breslauer?

32:15.627 --> 32:16.348
No, yeah.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.731
Breslauer is important to see.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.033
Who's Breslauer?

32:19.093 --> 32:20.115
I don't even know who Breslauer is.

32:20.135 --> 32:23.241
Oh, Bernard Breslauer is a guy you absolutely don't want to miss here.

32:23.761 --> 32:26.826
He lived right across from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

32:26.946 --> 32:27.827
How do you spell his name?

32:27.867 --> 32:30.411
B-R-E-S-L-A-U-E-R.

32:30.431 --> 32:30.612
B-R-E-S?

32:31.473 --> 32:31.814
Yeah.

32:31.834 --> 32:32.054
B-R-E-S.

32:32.415 --> 32:33.757
L-A-U-E-R.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.718
Uh-huh.

32:34.738 --> 32:35.579
New York collector.

32:35.780 --> 32:36.481
No, a dealer.

32:36.501 --> 32:37.242
New York dealer.

32:37.543 --> 32:38.384
Okay.

32:38.604 --> 32:39.746
Extraordinary dealer.

32:39.926 --> 32:41.989
Okay, I think Arthur mentioned him to me.

32:42.010 --> 32:43.251
Yeah, you should absolutely see him.

32:43.472 --> 32:45.996
Arthur has a lot of interesting Haven O'Moy stories.

32:46.016 --> 32:47.198
Yeah.

32:47.218 --> 32:48.199
Didn't know much about him.

32:49.121 --> 32:50.663
Everybody's got Haven O'Moy stories.

32:50.828 --> 32:57.619
But I mean, as a general thing, Breslauer in terms of, I mean, I wouldn't say, I don't in any way mean Breslauer's passe now, but he's getting old.

32:57.699 --> 33:01.945
But Breslauer was a very fine dealer.

33:02.025 --> 33:05.591
He's got a lot of the really important people.

33:05.611 --> 33:05.972
I'm going down.

33:05.992 --> 33:07.674
I have to do Rustenburg and Stern.

33:07.795 --> 33:08.756
They've been around.

33:08.856 --> 33:09.998
Interesting.

33:10.539 --> 33:13.423
I've interviewed Leonard Baskin and his wife.

33:13.684 --> 33:15.807
Do you know their collection at all?

33:16.546 --> 33:19.929
She's collecting something that really hasn't been collected.

33:19.949 --> 33:24.193
I mean, there's some of those feminists.

33:24.353 --> 33:28.597
I think an important point to all of this is are the different kinds of collectors.

33:28.778 --> 33:33.962
Like Baskin's wife doing that kind of thing, to me, is the real... It is one type.

33:34.022 --> 33:39.988
I'm not going to say pure collector, because pure collector is the one filling in a stamp album, collecting it for the sake of collecting it.

33:40.589 --> 33:45.253
But the people who read it, the people that you can discuss it with,

33:45.740 --> 33:47.222
That's what I enjoy the most.

33:47.763 --> 33:51.728
I should let you read the transcript of that interview I did with him one afternoon.

33:51.788 --> 33:58.858
It's amazing, because one will start a sentence, and the other will finish it as a complete sentence.

33:58.878 --> 34:03.043
They know exactly what they're talking about, and it comes out of the woodwork.

34:03.244 --> 34:06.969
And the sentence will just, it just took me hours to transcribe it.

34:07.409 --> 34:11.915
But to see people who know what they have, this is what you see after all.

34:11.975 --> 34:13.718
Bill Shady knows his stuff.

34:13.738 --> 34:14.599
He doesn't have to go in.

34:15.035 --> 34:17.078
look up where such and such a thing is.

34:17.799 --> 34:18.801
You know your stuff.

34:18.821 --> 34:21.585
I mean, these people know their stuff.

34:21.605 --> 34:23.448
I've been interested if Dick Manning knows his stuff.

34:23.468 --> 34:25.732
Carter Burden, I don't even think he knows who he collects.

34:26.152 --> 34:30.359
He's got 90,000 books, 7,000 authors that he's acquired in the last 10 years.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.083
You think he could name 500 of his authors?

34:33.143 --> 34:33.744
I'd be amazed.

34:34.425 --> 34:35.687
Not the way he's bought.

34:36.388 --> 34:37.210
And he's selling, too.

34:37.450 --> 34:38.371
Have you dealt with him at all?

34:38.391 --> 34:38.952
No.

34:38.972 --> 34:39.473
You know him?

34:39.605 --> 34:41.928
I know him, but he doesn't buy manuscript material.

34:41.948 --> 34:42.148
Is he?

34:42.168 --> 34:43.510
Do you think I'm going to have a terrible title to him?

34:43.530 --> 34:44.311
I haven't approached him yet.

34:44.331 --> 34:44.852
I have no idea.

34:44.892 --> 34:46.093
Priscilla knows him really well.

34:46.113 --> 34:47.555
Priscilla knows him really well.

34:47.575 --> 34:49.417
I haven't been with Priscilla next time.

34:49.437 --> 34:49.537
Okay.

34:49.557 --> 34:52.621
Well, and Priscilla has lunch with him, or was having lunch with him frequently.

34:52.801 --> 34:53.142
Really?

34:53.182 --> 34:53.602
Yeah.

34:53.622 --> 34:54.624
She'll help you then.

34:54.644 --> 34:54.784
Yeah.

34:54.804 --> 34:57.247
What about Koch?

34:57.267 --> 34:57.908
Who's Koch?

34:57.928 --> 34:58.489
Fred Koch.

34:58.649 --> 34:59.189
I don't know.

34:59.229 --> 35:01.252
He's the other big weirdo of the modern day.

35:01.632 --> 35:02.534
Fred?

35:02.554 --> 35:03.114
With a K?

35:03.134 --> 35:03.995
K-O-C-H.

35:04.156 --> 35:05.457
And where's Fred out of?

35:05.577 --> 35:06.118
Every place.

35:06.655 --> 35:07.756
I mean every place.

35:07.796 --> 35:11.480
He's bought Getty's house in London, down in Surrey.

35:11.921 --> 35:13.383
He's got a house in Monaco.

35:13.543 --> 35:15.585
He's got a big apartment on Fifth Avenue.

35:16.486 --> 35:18.148
Where did he collect?

35:18.769 --> 35:19.910
It's been all over the place.

35:20.390 --> 35:22.373
His stuff is mostly coming up for sale.

35:22.673 --> 35:29.941
He's been this wild man buyer, spending tens of millions, and not books, manuscripts.

35:30.442 --> 35:33.405
He's been a major buyer of musical manuscripts.

35:33.908 --> 35:36.652
which he is apparently giving to the Morgan Library.

35:37.753 --> 35:43.100
He bought some major, major stuff from Priscilla, in mindings.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.724
She mentioned it to me.

35:45.744 --> 35:52.052
He collected homosexual literature in terms of Cocteau and Oscar Wilde, and created prices.

35:52.553 --> 35:53.034
Crazy.

35:53.134 --> 35:54.616
But why did he collect the homosexual stuff?

35:54.636 --> 35:54.896
I don't know.

35:54.916 --> 35:56.679
It's all coming up for sale again.

35:56.699 --> 35:57.159
I mean, it is.

35:57.940 --> 35:58.821
Oh, he's raving.

35:59.142 --> 35:59.983
Okay.

36:00.436 --> 36:05.122
You notice how I pursued my question?

36:05.322 --> 36:08.586
I mean, everybody wondered, were AIDS or chains going to get to him first, you know?

36:09.026 --> 36:09.647
AIDS or what?

36:09.767 --> 36:10.148
Chains.

36:11.850 --> 36:13.051
How old is he?

36:16.275 --> 36:16.656
Forties.

36:16.996 --> 36:17.377
Really?

36:18.638 --> 36:22.803
He's part of the Koch family of Kansas that had this huge split.

36:22.823 --> 36:24.585
I mean, he's a real identifiable character.

36:24.605 --> 36:27.709
You look in the books 400, he's written up in there.

36:27.976 --> 36:34.904
He and his brother, I live in Dover, and his brother lived in Dover, Bill Koch.

36:35.545 --> 36:38.849
And the two of them sued the family and got like $800 million of fees.

36:38.869 --> 36:40.391
Jesus Christ.

36:40.511 --> 36:41.972
Settlement from their brothers.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.815
What was the source of the fortune?

36:43.975 --> 36:46.258
Oil and gas in Kansas.

36:46.278 --> 36:49.301
In Kansas.

36:49.361 --> 36:50.863
I mean, it's a real identifiable.

36:51.123 --> 36:52.545
It's coming up for sale where?

36:52.905 --> 36:55.148
At Christie's, June 7th and 8th.

36:58.655 --> 37:00.057
Is he breaking up the whole collection?

37:00.137 --> 37:00.578
I don't know.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.682
Christie's June 7th and 8th.

37:03.702 --> 37:03.782
Yep.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.264
So there's no catalog yet.

37:05.325 --> 37:05.505
No.

37:05.705 --> 37:06.967
I will call him today, however.

37:07.187 --> 37:13.817
I mean, he's a guy who was putting together on a huge scale and then stopped, all of a sudden stopped.

37:13.837 --> 37:17.702
And I don't know whether he's dumping everything or... That goes back to what I asked you earlier.

37:17.902 --> 37:18.203
Why?

37:18.864 --> 37:19.745
Why do people do this?

37:20.306 --> 37:21.127
They become bored.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.209
Maybe he has AIDS.

37:22.549 --> 37:24.612
I mean, I don't want to spend the records like that.

37:24.929 --> 37:29.634
I just don't know, because we sold a lot of material to him, but I never had a sense of the man.

37:30.575 --> 37:31.996
But Priscilla certainly knew.

37:32.016 --> 37:33.638
Priscilla will know how to get in touch with him.

37:33.758 --> 37:34.038
Oh, yeah.

37:34.299 --> 37:39.204
Well, we can give you his address and so on, but Priscilla, you need an introduction, and Priscilla would be the one.

37:39.224 --> 37:39.925
She's wonderful.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.266
Yeah.

37:42.227 --> 37:42.727
And Dan.

37:43.228 --> 37:43.668
Yeah.

37:43.688 --> 37:45.510
Dan's in my book.

37:45.550 --> 37:47.612
He just barged his way into my book.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.114
We had lunch in New York last week.

37:49.769 --> 37:51.973
And she was supposed to come, but she couldn't make it.

37:52.073 --> 37:54.578
And so I started interviewing Dan.

37:54.638 --> 37:56.482
I said, this is a fascinating guy.

37:57.023 --> 37:59.127
Dan is a real heavyweight.

37:59.648 --> 38:00.630
Fascinating guy.

38:00.650 --> 38:02.553
And he's got the right motivation that I like.

38:03.255 --> 38:06.641
He's gone broke buying books.

38:06.721 --> 38:11.811
He grew up knowing Lou Feldman, by the way.

38:11.993 --> 38:30.031
Every rotten thing that Hamilton says about Feldman, you've got this guy who went in as a kid, 11 years old, and who Feldman took him aside and gave him things, and showed him the greatest of compassion and understanding, and, you know, so, I mean, I will balance this, and I will, from this, draw a profile.

38:30.051 --> 38:34.816
And Feldman's not a major guy, but he is part of the Texas story to a very great extent.

38:35.817 --> 38:38.440
Yeah, I mean, some of the stuff down at Texas stunk.

38:39.061 --> 38:41.684
I mean, I don't mean to be, you know, painting it.

38:41.905 --> 38:46.150
According to Ellen Dunlap, you were pretty critical about Texas there for a while.

38:47.192 --> 38:51.558
Well, I came... You kind of pissed off, as a matter of fact, as the hero.

38:52.259 --> 38:57.085
Well, it related more to Jenkins, and a lot of the other stuff that went on down there, on small scale.

38:57.105 --> 38:57.465
Guy Jenkins.

38:57.485 --> 38:58.827
Yeah, on small scale.

38:59.789 --> 39:06.958
And I thought that... I really questioned the whole idea of, you know, using public money in such a crazy, cavalier way.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.448
And also the whole thing with Roberts.

39:11.690 --> 39:15.633
Calton Lake brought me down there to do some appraisals and to review a lot of stuff.

39:15.673 --> 39:19.296
Calton became acting director when Roberts was talking about him two days ago.

39:19.716 --> 39:23.560
And Calton brought me in as a total outsider.

39:24.020 --> 39:29.365
Nobody could complain about whatever I found because I had no stake in anything down there.

39:30.226 --> 39:36.011
And I think, you know, I just think there's a lot of real, real slipshod stuff going on.

39:36.031 --> 39:36.591
When was that?

39:36.807 --> 39:38.770
Well, Carlton was the interim guy.

39:38.790 --> 39:39.191
Yeah.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.673
So just before Deckard came on.

39:41.254 --> 39:47.964
Yeah, I mean, I think that during the war, from what I saw during the Warren Roberts period, it was just a lot of real slipshod practices.

39:47.984 --> 39:53.553
I can't, I mean, I wouldn't get in, I'm not going to ever get into speculating whether people got something out of these deals or not.

39:53.713 --> 39:59.062
Ellen thinks that Warren got really screwed, that he was the victim of a political hatchet job.

39:59.102 --> 40:03.068
She would know, I just... It was really Harry Ransom's deal, I mean, and...

40:04.499 --> 40:13.317
Warren told me, for instance, how he's kind of met that, you know, he found the Hanley Key Collection, and of course, Harry always took credit for it.

40:13.337 --> 40:15.101
And he says, you see, this is such a machine.

40:15.221 --> 40:16.905
I wrote that.

40:17.045 --> 40:18.788
Harry Ransom didn't write that.

40:18.849 --> 40:25.883
Well, he was kind of doing these desacto things, I guess, and not getting any credit, and then he got kicked out, or whatever happened.

40:26.470 --> 40:27.592
But what did you think?

40:27.772 --> 40:29.916
Hamilton says, go look and see some of this stuff.

40:29.936 --> 40:32.239
He says, tell me if you've ever heard of any of these writers before.

40:32.259 --> 40:35.164
He says, you have total unknowns, people who have never published anything.

40:35.505 --> 40:40.333
They put a price on their papers, and they sell them to Feldman, who in turn sells them to Texas.

40:40.673 --> 40:41.555
And this is what he says.

40:41.635 --> 40:43.117
Can you name me some of these authors?

40:43.758 --> 40:45.661
No, he says, you just go down and look at the file.

40:46.743 --> 40:50.890
Again, he's making charges without backing it up.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.292
He doesn't have the...

40:52.795 --> 40:54.057
He could be accurate.

40:54.337 --> 40:55.679
Give me a name.

40:55.939 --> 41:02.409
See, that was the whole thing in the Hitler Diaries, that he told a reporter from Newsweek that they were fake.

41:02.609 --> 41:04.351
And the guy said, well, don't you want to see a photocopy?

41:04.872 --> 41:06.755
He said, I don't need to see a photocopy to know they're fake.

41:06.775 --> 41:08.517
And the guy said, well, how the hell can you know they're fake?

41:09.098 --> 41:10.380
There's no chance as how they are.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.722
Well, see, that's ridiculous.

41:11.982 --> 41:13.725
Who needs an expert at $5,000 an hour?

41:13.765 --> 41:17.129
I mean, it's crazy.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.772
It's that shoot from the hip.

41:18.792 --> 41:21.756
You really have to beware with him.

41:22.090 --> 41:27.038
Well, I sensed that the other day because he was telling me things about it.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.421
I just came back from Texas.

41:28.601 --> 41:29.723
I saw this place.

41:29.783 --> 41:30.344
There must be.

41:30.364 --> 41:31.866
All right, so they've got locks of hair.

41:32.347 --> 41:34.310
Listen, Harvard has locks of hair.

41:34.330 --> 41:36.895
The Athenaeum has a book bound in human skin.

41:37.235 --> 41:44.307
The Antiquarian Society had a desiccated Indian mummy that they've... You know, everybody... University College London has Jeremy Bentham.

41:44.327 --> 41:44.988
The whole guy.

41:45.910 --> 41:47.372
Sits in the library.

41:47.774 --> 41:48.235
Is that right?

41:48.315 --> 41:48.975
Yeah, it's true.

41:49.076 --> 41:56.225
You look him up in Dictionary National Biography, it says he left all this money at the University College London Library, but he has to attend all the trustee meetings, and he's stuffed.

41:57.126 --> 41:58.547
So really, it's a great story.

41:59.148 --> 42:00.230
Do you think I can see him?

42:00.450 --> 42:02.032
Oh, yeah, no problem.

42:03.073 --> 42:04.795
The key thing is to ask him where the head is.

42:05.616 --> 42:10.562
He took his head off, and he's got a wax head now, and his head's kept in a box.

42:10.783 --> 42:11.864
Yeah, isn't that bizarre?

42:11.884 --> 42:12.184
Yeah.

42:12.204 --> 42:17.511
When the Brits turn around, they say, well, Texas has the socks that, yeah, we gotta go.

42:17.980 --> 42:22.485
It's crazy.

42:22.845 --> 42:24.327
It looks like an outhouse.

42:24.928 --> 42:27.130
And this is University College London, right?

42:27.150 --> 42:28.031
Yeah, University College London.

42:28.231 --> 42:29.893
I'm going to be there in two weeks.

42:29.913 --> 42:31.555
Yeah, I mean, and that's right in the middle of London.

42:31.695 --> 42:32.676
It's near the British Museum.

42:33.277 --> 42:34.638
Well, that's where I'm going to be doing a lot of work.

42:34.658 --> 42:36.560
But for an absolute wacko story.

42:36.761 --> 42:37.842
That's a great story.

42:38.903 --> 42:42.707
And, of course, I'm sure they were appalled by it, but if they don't do it, they lose, right?

42:42.787 --> 42:43.228
Yeah.

42:43.248 --> 42:47.953
Just like if Peeps's library, if they don't do it exactly the way he wants it, it goes to the other college.

42:49.773 --> 42:51.695
Jeremy Bentham's body?

42:51.715 --> 42:53.998
Do you think he did this as a joke?

42:54.018 --> 42:54.679
I'm trying to find it.

42:54.759 --> 42:58.584
I'm pretty sure that it's written up in here as to, uh... What's the book you're looking up there?

42:58.604 --> 43:00.086
Dictionary of National Biography.

43:01.347 --> 43:02.989
Well, that's of England, right?

43:03.650 --> 43:05.513
Yeah.

43:05.533 --> 43:07.295
Yeah, the National Biography is the English one.

43:07.315 --> 43:10.339
American is August American.

43:10.359 --> 43:11.460
I'll check that out at Harvard.

43:16.925 --> 43:27.660
Yeah, I'm going to get out of here in a moment.

43:27.780 --> 43:28.721
I've seen the body.

43:28.941 --> 43:33.728
Don't waste time on it.

43:33.788 --> 43:34.709
I'll find it.

43:34.729 --> 43:36.992
I thought it was right at the end here.

43:37.253 --> 43:40.317
I'll get a photocopy of this if I find it quickly.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.555
I'm going to shut this off, okay?

43:45.035 --> 43:47.299
Can I come back again?

43:47.439 --> 43:48.360
Definitely.

43:48.881 --> 43:50.464
You're doing a really good job with this.

43:50.564 --> 43:51.726
I'm very interested.

43:51.746 --> 43:53.789
Does it sound like I'm on track of some interesting things?

43:53.889 --> 43:54.390
I think it is.

43:54.410 --> 43:56.453
I'm very interested in helping you out any way I can.

43:56.493 --> 43:57.955
Thank you.

43:58.556 --> 44:00.799
I think it's called J.A.

44:00.900 --> 44:01.340
Farrar.

44:01.460 --> 44:04.044
It's a book we have around here.

44:04.185 --> 44:06.388
I think I might even have it.

44:06.976 --> 44:08.058
About literary forgeries?

44:08.078 --> 44:09.240
Yeah, about literary forgeries.

44:09.260 --> 44:10.943
I have access to tons of books.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.606
I'm doing all my research at Harvard, so.

44:12.686 --> 44:20.339
It's not, you know, forgeries that are not like a George Washington, but where people are forging things for the text, William Henry Island forging shapes.

44:20.359 --> 44:21.721
Like CJ Wise and stuff like that.

44:21.741 --> 44:22.082
Yeah.

44:22.102 --> 44:30.776
But, well, that's, you know, more of a collecting kind of thing, but where the literary text is what is really the object of the scam.

44:30.796 --> 44:31.718
I think I know the book.

44:32.204 --> 44:44.777
At some point, I'll give you, I've just corrected a chapter of a book that I'm doing on forgeries that has all of this kind of stuff in it, how over the years the role that forgeries have played, literary forgeries have played, influencing history.

44:46.538 --> 44:48.380
So you're doing your research on this?

44:48.400 --> 44:48.701
Oh, yeah.

44:48.841 --> 44:51.483
Yeah, this book is up to almost just photographs now.

44:51.944 --> 44:53.085
We've just got to get the photographs.

44:53.185 --> 44:54.106
Where are you publishing it?

44:54.627 --> 44:56.268
I haven't looked around at all.

44:56.328 --> 44:58.110
I may just do it myself.

44:58.327 --> 45:00.029
I'm doing it to distribute it myself.

45:00.109 --> 45:05.034
I want a book out to show people how you authenticate material.

45:05.054 --> 45:06.155
There's not a guessing game.

45:07.176 --> 45:14.123
It has nothing at all to do with just instinct, because instinct, in these cases, is really based upon things you're actually observing.

45:14.463 --> 45:15.944
You know, people say this doesn't feel like.

45:15.964 --> 45:17.586
Well, they're looking at a color of an ink.

45:17.606 --> 45:18.667
They're looking at texture.

45:19.148 --> 45:20.509
And you can illustrate all of this.

45:21.270 --> 45:23.312
Who do you suggest I see in London, by the way?

45:23.912 --> 45:24.633
Any names?

45:24.653 --> 45:26.135
Have you heard of Roy Davids?

45:26.355 --> 45:26.595
No.

45:27.149 --> 45:33.976
He's probably very hard to see, but you're certainly welcome to say that I suggested that he take a few minutes and talk to you.

45:34.256 --> 45:38.861
He's the head of rare books and manuscripts at Sotheby's.

45:38.881 --> 45:43.065
But he's also... And make good contacts at Sotheby's in New York, too.

45:43.085 --> 45:45.268
He's also an awful lot more than that.

45:45.608 --> 45:49.873
He runs a whole series of divisions at Sotheby's.

45:49.893 --> 45:53.656
It's very strange, because he's the expert in charge of rare books and manuscripts.

45:53.977 --> 45:55.198
He's head of the department.

45:55.533 --> 45:58.537
He is one of the senior vice presidents with a whole group.

45:58.557 --> 46:01.161
I mean, everything like jewelry and all kinds of stuff.

46:01.181 --> 46:03.325
He's also the head of the marketing division.

46:03.365 --> 46:08.773
So he's way up, and so Roy is very hard to get a hold of.

46:09.113 --> 46:11.416
I have access to John Marion.

46:12.999 --> 46:15.583
I'll have Marion to be an introduction.

46:15.603 --> 46:17.305
He's the head of selfies in New York, of course.

46:17.325 --> 46:21.191
And David Redden, who does not get along with Roy.

46:21.211 --> 46:21.672
Is that right?

46:21.732 --> 46:21.912
Yeah.

46:21.932 --> 46:25.337
No, he's kind of junior to Roy, and they don't have too much...

46:26.026 --> 46:30.552
Yeah, you would not want any recommendation coming from Redwood.

46:30.832 --> 46:31.773
Call the secretary.

46:31.793 --> 46:33.215
His name is Julie.

46:33.355 --> 46:33.496
Julie?

46:33.516 --> 46:34.857
She's in London, right?

46:34.877 --> 46:39.984
And just say that you've talked to me and that I suggested that if Roy could just get a few minutes to talk to you.

46:40.044 --> 46:41.606
I might do it on the fly, like while I'm there.

46:41.626 --> 46:42.628
I'm here for a couple days.

46:42.688 --> 46:46.633
Instead of setting it up, that gives them time to turn you down.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.196
I have all these strategies, by the way, and they all work.

46:50.418 --> 46:53.822
Tell Julie that I said that it was worth Roy's time to have a drink with you.

46:54.055 --> 46:56.039
And then I think Denny is going to work on with you.

46:56.580 --> 46:56.741
Okay.

46:56.941 --> 46:59.567
It's worth Roy's time.

47:00.068 --> 47:00.689
This is great.

47:00.930 --> 47:02.413
I'm going to let you go because you don't get that point.

47:02.433 --> 47:04.478
I will get them to get a copy of this.

47:04.959 --> 47:07.925
I'm going to shut off that machine.

47:08.787 --> 47:09.769
Wow, it's horrific.
