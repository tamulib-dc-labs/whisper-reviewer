00:03.457 --> 00:09.143
Up next is a man who, like Walt Crawford, traveled all the way across the country to be with us.

00:10.564 --> 00:20.074
Dr. Jeff Rothenberg is a senior computer scientist in the social policy department of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.

00:21.495 --> 00:33.227
He received a master's degree in computer science from the University of Wisconsin in 1969, and then spent the next four years working toward a doctorate in artificial intelligence.

00:34.253 --> 00:48.648
His research has included work in modeling theory, investigations into the effects of information technology on humanities research, and numerous studies involving information technology policy issues.

00:50.309 --> 01:03.062
A widely published author, Jeff was commissioned by the Council on Library of Information Resources to write Avoiding Technological Quicksand, a description of his proposal

01:03.346 --> 01:10.177
for emulating obsolete software and hardware systems as a means of preserving digital information.

01:10.818 --> 01:14.744
This is also the theme he'll be exploring for us this afternoon.

01:15.485 --> 01:23.498
Here to address the topic, emulation as a preservation strategy, I'm delighted to present Dr. Jeff Rothenberg.

01:33.502 --> 01:36.546
Can you hear me through this?

01:36.566 --> 01:50.064
I actually got involved in this back in 1992, working with someone at the National Archives and Archives Administration.

01:50.084 --> 02:02.361
And in 1995, I wrote an article on the subject of South Carolina Basin for Scientific American, which some of you may have read.

02:02.695 --> 02:10.328
Later that year, they had a 150th anniversary issue in which they cited one or two items from each year that they thought were particularly important.

02:10.769 --> 02:13.313
And I was delighted that they cited the issue.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.799
My article on digital preservation is one of them for that year.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.806
The other one was about a mechanical fish called Robocunani.

02:20.866 --> 02:24.853
You can't always win.

02:26.436 --> 02:27.538
What I'm going to do is

02:27.721 --> 02:32.566
I'm going to start out with a little teaser for this subject and then I'm going to back up and get a little more detail.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.947
I hope this is going to be bright.

02:35.268 --> 02:43.777
This is a probably fourth or fifth generation photograph of a copy of the 1609 quarto edition of Shakespeare Sonnets.

02:44.458 --> 02:45.699
This one is from a Folger.

02:46.420 --> 02:52.986
I point out that it's quite readable despite a little bit of changed typography and spelling and punctuation and two other oddities.

02:53.168 --> 03:13.352
But I'm particularly interested in the last portraying of the couplet, where as many of the signs are fascinated by immortality, he says to his love, but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou of us, nor shall death brag thou wanderest in its shade, when in eternal lines to time thou rose.

03:14.313 --> 03:21.522
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives light to thee.

03:23.088 --> 03:30.338
Now, if you were to update this a little bit for the digital age, the final couple would have to be rewritten in it.

03:31.719 --> 03:46.299
And it would come out something like, so long as we have the magnetic stuff on this disk is not evaporated, and so long as humans have the appropriate size and speed of disk drives, and so long as we have the hardware controllers with drivers to read the format of the disk, and so long as we have the application software, et cetera, et cetera.

03:46.679 --> 03:51.205
It wrecks the iambic processor.

03:51.674 --> 03:54.818
And in a nutshell, that's the problem with physical preservation.

03:54.858 --> 03:58.803
I'm going to talk and just talk a little bit about the nature of the problem itself.

03:58.983 --> 04:06.352
And I'm going to show you some examples of the kinds of things that are easily lost in conversion and migration.

04:06.372 --> 04:09.136
There's nothing intended to attack the previous speaker.

04:09.156 --> 04:13.081
I don't tend this to be an abseminent attack.

04:14.482 --> 04:21.411
But I am going to be carrying into migration somewhat as to the approach that most people have been, I think, a bit uncritically

04:22.353 --> 04:23.234
Sydney will work.

04:24.215 --> 04:30.323
Now, I don't think I need to preach this, but there are lots of kinds of records that are important for long periods of time.

04:30.343 --> 04:34.327
One of my favorite is records about things like, where did we bury the plutonium?

04:40.635 --> 04:52.309
Plutonium, half-life plutonium is 20,000 years, so to get down to 1 100th of its original value would take 133,000 years, fairly long periods.

04:52.660 --> 05:11.669
What we mean by preservation, there's a quote I like from Sue McKenna, who's an archivist in Australia, who defines it as to enable the reliable, authentic, meaningful, and accessible records to be carried forward through time, within and beyond organizational boundaries, for as long as they are needed for whatever multiple purposes they serve.

05:12.591 --> 05:17.318
What I like to take out of this is preservation must allow future users to do a whole lot of things.

05:17.652 --> 05:25.221
Retrieve and access, certainly, but also decipher, view, interpret, understand, appreciate, experience, any other words that you'd like to add there.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.825
To do whatever it is we do with information.

05:28.285 --> 05:30.348
And this applies to all informational entities.

05:30.368 --> 05:35.374
I won't be distinguishing here between documents, records, data, artworks that are in digital form.

05:35.975 --> 05:42.883
And we'll be focusing somewhat on foreign digital records, or at least on records that would lose a lot if they were not in digital form.

05:43.370 --> 05:47.537
And the final line there is that we need to preserve things in meaningful and valid ways.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.350
So there have been some examples of things that have been lost or almost lost.

05:55.370 --> 06:02.762
Some of you probably know this report from the House of Representatives in 1990 called Taking a Bite Out of History.

06:03.724 --> 06:09.073
Who says the Congress doesn't have a sense of humor?

06:09.931 --> 06:18.204
And there were a number of things cited, including the 1960 census, which is widely talked about, although nothing was apparently truly lost.

06:18.224 --> 06:21.268
We came very close in that instance.

06:21.288 --> 06:23.832
So it's not that this is just an abstract problem.

06:24.133 --> 06:28.199
There certainly are things that can and will be lost if we don't do something.

06:28.219 --> 06:34.268
And so you might say, and I think people have said, well, why are we in this headlong rush to digitize everything if this is a problem?

06:34.855 --> 06:42.202
And I would argue that our documents, our data, our artifacts are going to become increasingly digital, whether we like it or not, for good reasons.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.705
And the reasons are pretty obvious, but I'll enumerate them.

06:45.985 --> 06:51.670
The first and probably the central focus of a lot of these advantages is that digital things can be copied perfectly.

06:52.351 --> 06:57.416
You can copy a digital thing perfectly and know that you have copied it perfectly and verify that fact.

06:57.436 --> 07:02.280
And that's the basis for allowing us to access and distribute things so easily over networks and communications.

07:02.918 --> 07:05.522
Furthermore, digital documents and things are easy to process.

07:05.542 --> 07:10.689
We can do all sorts of new things with them in all of their phases of development, from draft through publicating.

07:10.709 --> 07:11.791
We can reformat them.

07:11.811 --> 07:16.859
We can search through them in ways that were unthinkable before we had digital representations.

07:16.939 --> 07:27.574
And they allow us to integrate information from a number of different sources, and they create truly new capabilities like hypermedia, distributed documents, interactive documents of various sorts.

07:27.594 --> 07:30.799
And again, I'll talk about that in a little more detail as we go along.

07:31.353 --> 07:37.142
Well, then you might say, well, okay, so why don't we just print everything if we can say things that way.

07:37.182 --> 07:44.412
And the problem is that the nature of a digital document, because of those attributes I was just discussing, really prevents printing in many cases.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.517
That is, you can print, but by printing, you lose all those advantages.

07:47.837 --> 07:50.702
You can no longer copy perfectly, distribute access remotely.

07:51.463 --> 07:59.875
And in many cases, for many of the more interesting kinds of digital artifacts, it isn't even really meaningful to print multimedia, multidimensional things.

08:00.327 --> 08:01.508
So we really can't cheat.

08:02.850 --> 08:10.379
And just to remind people that analog media, you know, have their problems, is to tend to generate the facts of the sun.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.643
The facts back and forth between two facts machines.

08:13.963 --> 08:16.626
On the eighth try, I was disappointed that it still looked too good.

08:17.047 --> 08:21.492
It really came through.

08:22.079 --> 08:28.228
But the problem is the digital things, digital documents and artifacts, are also very vulnerable to loss.

08:28.348 --> 08:30.651
And I refer to this as the lemming phenomenon.

08:30.771 --> 08:35.858
I think of this as a number of different factors that are each racing each other to the cliff to see which can jump over first.

08:35.878 --> 08:41.046
I understand lemmings don't really do that, but it's too good a metaphor to give up.

08:41.066 --> 08:48.516
So one is the, we're probably all aware of, is the physical decay of media, the fact that things just don't last all that long.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.719
I'm not going to talk about that much today.

08:50.969 --> 08:58.218
Even more problematic probably is the fact that the media become obsolete often before they even lose their physical content.

08:58.698 --> 09:16.960
But what I'm going to focus on is dependence on software and the fact that software formats or the logical format of something depends on particular software and software of course only runs on environments that include operating systems and other software and it only runs on hardware of a particular type and all of that stuff becomes obsolete.

09:17.311 --> 09:22.937
So if any of these things become obsolete, we lose, effectively lose, our digital material.

09:23.498 --> 09:34.951
And I've been going around the country now for a couple of years saying that because of this, the best we can say is that digital documents last forever, or five years before.

09:34.971 --> 09:39.696
I prefer mathematical notation.

09:41.057 --> 09:46.103
So, having said that, I have a way of a graphical,

09:46.285 --> 09:50.010
reminder of the kinds of media that are already obsolete.

09:50.030 --> 09:57.259
The centerpiece of this, which I published in the Scientific American article, it's my only photo credited print, so I always like to show it.

09:57.279 --> 10:08.293
And the centerpiece is a little coffee table reproduction of the Rosetta Stone, one third size, and it's surrounded by a number of digital media which are already obsolete despite their short tenure.

10:08.780 --> 10:18.756
When I went looking for the paper tape that someone mentioned earlier today, I actually couldn't find any, although, you know, used to be computer scientists had it hanging from their doorways and had to go through it like a lean curtain in the 60s.

10:19.197 --> 10:23.624
But when I went looking for some, I had to send to a friend in Colorado to actually get a sample of it.

10:24.165 --> 10:24.886
It's already gone.

10:25.687 --> 10:27.430
Now, it's fairly straightforward.

10:27.832 --> 10:33.239
To solve the media problem, people have talked about refreshing or sometimes referred to as migration.

10:33.639 --> 10:39.767
The terminology, unfortunately, is very confusing, but people use migration to need both refreshing media and converting format.

10:40.187 --> 10:45.133
But in any case, the problem is we can't expect truly archival media in the near future.

10:45.173 --> 10:49.198
People have said, well, why can't we make a platinum CD that lasts for 200 years?

10:49.820 --> 10:55.970
And the answer is we could, but I don't think anyone in their right mind would develop such a product because it would be obsolete in five years.

10:55.990 --> 11:00.997
In any case, something faster, cheaper, more dense, and easier to use would come along and would replace it.

11:01.358 --> 11:02.780
So its shelf life would be wasted.

11:03.421 --> 11:11.153
And therefore, I don't think the market is going to warrant developing those media until things slow down, which might happen in the next century, but not in the next 20 years.

11:12.280 --> 11:17.707
Therefore, the only solution to this is we have to copy things to new media before the old media become unreadable.

11:17.727 --> 11:21.372
And nothing I say today is going to subvert this requirement.

11:21.392 --> 11:23.335
Okay, we have to do this if we're going to save the bits.

11:23.736 --> 11:31.747
No matter what we do with those bits, whether we convert them to save them for data or whatever, we have to do the refreshing to keep the bit streams alive on media.

11:32.467 --> 11:36.974
But the hard problem is that digital documents are software dependent.

11:36.994 --> 11:37.655
What does that mean?

11:37.715 --> 11:38.576
I'll give some examples.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.680
But basically it means that they can only be seen by running a program.

11:41.845 --> 11:43.046
of some sort.

11:43.066 --> 11:46.670
The data file, the thing that you save as the document, is not enough.

11:46.690 --> 11:53.718
You need some piece of software that recreates the thing that you were interested in out of that saved file.

11:54.438 --> 12:03.608
And of course, that really means that such documents are system dependent, not just the software, but they're dependent on the heart that that software runs on.

12:03.628 --> 12:05.490
What is it that makes something

12:05.960 --> 12:21.479
software dependent, well, either if it's only meaningful to its original software and there's nothing else can really figure it out at all, or if we really need to see exactly what it's offer a reader, audience thought, and there are cases where this might be important, I'll suggest to you when I go through the examples, why that might be relevant.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.743
So here are some examples just to get us concrete.

12:25.364 --> 12:31.832
If you take the Shakespeare sonnet and you just, you know, put it in ASCII, but you just format it this way,

12:32.234 --> 12:38.744
It's still there, but you probably wouldn't recognize it as a problem if you were scanning somewhere, because the structure doesn't leap out at you.

12:39.104 --> 12:41.868
So we haven't lost much, but even that is a little bit of loss.

12:41.908 --> 12:54.327
Here's a more interesting case from Winnie the Pooh, where the kangaroo takes Piglet for a ride, and Piglet says in this sort of roller coaster text, if this is flying, I shall never really take to it.

12:54.678 --> 13:10.766
Well, if you were to save this as an ASCII text stream, the obvious way, you would strip out one line after the next, and you would wind up with this kind of postmodern rendition on the bottom here.

13:10.786 --> 13:18.159
See, any avowed postmodernists in the audience?

13:18.179 --> 13:18.821
Good, but now let's talk slowly.

13:18.841 --> 13:18.941
Okay.

13:18.961 --> 13:19.622
Here's, uh...

13:19.973 --> 13:21.314
This is a somewhat more serious one.

13:21.655 --> 13:24.217
There are lots of ways of representing this familiar structure.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.159
This one is perhaps not very clever.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.822
I just use spacing between the columns.

13:28.842 --> 13:40.714
But if this is a perfectly valid way of representing the table, if I were to do that, and I merely change font, I lose the columns because the spacing has changed.

13:41.314 --> 13:45.298
Many brave men and women gave their careers finding those columns.

13:45.318 --> 13:48.141
And I wiped them out with a font change.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.514
So when people say, well, you might lose little things like Fox.

13:52.976 --> 14:01.087
Just for the archivists among you, this violates.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.890
My one archival joke.

14:03.910 --> 14:08.496
I was in San Diego some years ago at the Scripps Institute, the Graphic Institute.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.999
They had this up on the wall, pretty much in this form.

14:11.019 --> 14:12.441
We'll ask you to print out this.

14:12.691 --> 14:34.868
letter that was written in 1853 by some of my traditions to his mother and I was reading along and then it gets to this thing at the end it says just in the middle here there's suddenly a parenthesis it says when I get a hair on my pen I never stop to take it off and I thought oh there must be something going on there so I got on and called the archivist Deborah Day who of course was delighted that anybody cared and she sent me this

14:36.097 --> 14:37.118
Now, it's a little hard to see here.

14:37.138 --> 14:38.259
For one thing, it's cross-written.

14:38.279 --> 14:44.927
It's written one page and then turned 90 degrees and written the other page, presumably to save paper, but maybe to avoid prying eyes over the shoulder.

14:45.348 --> 14:53.257
But you get to the point in question here, and of course, things get blotted because apparently a hair got in the middle of the nib of his head and spread out and he started pulling it.

14:53.277 --> 15:01.446
All of that would have been lost, or at least the motivation behind it would have been lost if we hadn't kept this original in some form.

15:02.641 --> 15:04.723
Here's a more serious example.

15:04.823 --> 15:13.453
This is data documenting failure of the O-ring seals in the solid state boosters of the space shuttle prior to the Challenger disaster.

15:13.853 --> 15:17.978
And this is not exactly the form that NASA had the information, but it's something like it.

15:18.258 --> 15:25.006
It's just a table with some numbers, plotting the level of damage against temperature and the number of occasions that it occurred.

15:25.026 --> 15:27.408
And you look at this and nothing leaps out at you.

15:27.428 --> 15:30.071
It's sort of not obvious what this is telling you.

15:30.091 --> 15:32.614
On the other hand, if you take that same data and you plot it,

15:34.957 --> 15:35.558
You get this.

15:37.100 --> 15:37.901
Two things leap out.

15:38.061 --> 15:40.544
One is that the data actually ends at 53 degrees.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.788
You have no right extrapolating from 31 degrees where challenges are launched.

15:44.088 --> 15:46.371
But if you do, the curve goes off scale.

15:46.792 --> 15:59.628
Now, the point of this is that if you had been a NASA manager looking at this form of the data as displayed, you might be held more accountable in the future for having made that decision than if you had been looking at the previous tabular form.

15:59.988 --> 16:03.192
So the form in which something is presented to its original audience

16:03.610 --> 16:10.918
may be critical for various purposes, at least for things like accountability, but also for historical and aesthetic understanding.

16:12.740 --> 16:25.173
Here's an example of, you don't have to understand what this is, kind of a standard entity relationship diagram describing a database structure with boxes and text in them and lines connecting them and funny symbols.

16:25.613 --> 16:32.200
And the point is simply that this is created by a program called ER-WIN, which runs all the other windows that's ER design.

16:32.517 --> 16:35.963
And if you save that file, what gets saved is this.

16:39.970 --> 16:41.913
Ages and pages and pages of it.

16:41.933 --> 16:46.961
It's somewhat human readable, but I defy you to recreate the previous slide by reading 1,000 pages of this.

16:48.544 --> 16:53.933
So digital things, by their nature, digital files, are really programmed.

16:54.655 --> 16:57.900
And this may be a somewhat foreign notion.

16:58.218 --> 17:10.481
some of you, but a program is really just a sequence of commands in some formal language that's intended to be interpreted by some process, some automated interpreter that understands that language and does what it says to do.

17:10.602 --> 17:21.222
So in the previous case, the language is things like draw a box at this point and put this line connecting it with this kind of symbol at the end of that line and connect it to that other box and so on.

17:21.573 --> 17:26.524
digital document or data or entity, if you will, is really a program.

17:26.544 --> 17:35.844
Now the simplest ones are fairly simple, like an ASCII stream or a numeric stream, but in general it is not enough to just save this.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.953
You really have to save the interpreter.

17:40.557 --> 17:46.184
And saving the bits without the interpreter would be like saving hieroglyphics without having a rosetta stone.

17:46.584 --> 17:48.166
You just don't know what hieroglyphics mean.

17:48.587 --> 17:52.432
Actually it's worse than that because in this case the interpreter is not just another document.

17:52.452 --> 17:54.714
It's an executable thing.

17:54.775 --> 17:56.557
It's a program that has to run.

17:57.538 --> 18:01.563
So that makes things rather different, rather complicated.

18:02.024 --> 18:07.290
My point here is that all sorts of documents, all documents require interpretation.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.508
You know, once you read them, humans interpret things.

18:10.528 --> 18:11.950
They interpret poetry.

18:12.010 --> 18:17.135
Tim mentioned the idea that poetry is something that, you know, interpreting poetry is human activity.

18:17.716 --> 18:24.804
But if it's digitally represented, then before you get to do that human interpretation, you have to do this prior stage of interpreting.

18:25.044 --> 18:30.310
That is, you have to run some piece of software that renders the thing visible or readable by humans.

18:30.330 --> 18:36.096
And so that's what I'm talking about here as this additional stage of interpretation that digital entity is required.

18:36.599 --> 18:42.330
They still require a human interpretation, but without this prior stage, it's as if they were written in invisible ink.

18:42.751 --> 18:45.697
They just don't appear on the page until you do the magic.

18:47.180 --> 18:51.148
Someone mentioned this a little earlier, that we really are going to have to choose what to lose.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.956
You can't just save a digital thing the way you save a book.

18:54.976 --> 18:57.561
You put a book away at the vault, you're pretty sure you saved it.

18:57.794 --> 19:02.159
It's going to fade over time and the paper may have acid in it and there are those issues.

19:02.179 --> 19:05.744
But within the limit of the physical medium, you've saved everything about it as possible to save.

19:06.204 --> 19:09.068
Not as context, metadata and all of that, but the item itself.

19:09.789 --> 19:13.113
There is no real equivalent or no obvious equivalent in the digital world.

19:14.595 --> 19:20.902
And you might ask, well, what do we really mean about saving things, particularly saving things authentically?

19:21.303 --> 19:22.084
What does that mean?

19:22.845 --> 19:25.388
I'll get this right by the end of the talk.

19:26.043 --> 19:27.406
Sorry, I stayed in here.

19:27.586 --> 19:30.512
There are different meanings of authenticity for different disciplines.

19:30.532 --> 19:33.638
I recently attended a workshop in Clearedale in Washington on this subject.

19:33.658 --> 19:36.243
I guess it was back in January or something recently.

19:36.844 --> 19:42.415
One is if you look at the archives, they have a pretty well-defined notion of what it means for records to be authentic.

19:42.614 --> 20:00.235
uh i've worked with the netflix uh efforts in europe and the netherlands with the dutch library and from a deposit library point of view there's a somewhat different perspective you're interested in preserving publications as they were submitted to you by the publisher and you may feel that you're not allowed to copy or reformat or republish them in any way

20:00.215 --> 20:10.188
For a data warehouse, you might decide that it's important to you that users in the future be able to see data using all of their interpretive facilities, even if the original users didn't have those.

20:11.009 --> 20:14.854
For instance, fractal relationships weren't even defined 50 years ago.

20:16.136 --> 20:19.540
So there are different notions of authenticity which complicates things.

20:20.330 --> 20:30.639
And what I've suggested is that what you really like is to have some sort of original, which you could say, where for a traditional document, it's pretty obvious what that means.

20:30.659 --> 20:32.421
It's a distinct physical artifact.

20:32.882 --> 20:47.295
But I suggest in the digital world that we might define something analogously by saying that a digital original, which I like to hyphenate, is any record comparison of a digital document that has a maximum likelihood of retaining all of the relevant and meaningful aspects of the document.

20:47.315 --> 20:49.797
Now, what would such a thing be is another question.

20:50.215 --> 20:55.363
But that would be the analogy to saving an original thing, an original digital thing.

20:55.903 --> 21:01.532
Now, the solutions that people have proposed to these problems really sort of fall into two classes.

21:02.593 --> 21:09.203
One is the reliance on migration and standards, which I love together because they tend to be rather tightly connected.

21:09.684 --> 21:19.598
The archives, National Archives, for instance, has this notion that they have a limited number of acceptably put formats to translate into those formats on ingestion or accession.

21:19.831 --> 21:22.854
then they will accept things, and then they will migrate over time.

21:23.715 --> 21:36.830
The other general approach has been for people to suggest saving obsolete hardware, the Kpro example that Finet gave, of saving an obsolete system so that you have a chance of reading old media on those old systems.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.071
Now each of these have problems.

21:38.592 --> 21:46.400
It's not that they don't have a role, particularly the standards doesn't have a role to play in an ultimate solution, but let me talk about some of the problems.

21:47.622 --> 21:48.943
First I'll talk about the

21:49.362 --> 21:57.054
The idea is, if you have a standard that lasted long enough, then you could keep reading the digital thing in that standard form.

21:57.394 --> 21:59.898
And when a standard became obsolete, you would simply migrate.

21:59.918 --> 22:03.063
That is, you would convert, if you will, or translate or transform.

22:03.443 --> 22:12.417
I don't care which of those words you use, but change the thing from one digital format into a new one, into a new standard form, so that that would last for another 10 or 20 years.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.850
Migration has a long history in computer science.

22:14.870 --> 22:15.871
We've been doing it forever.

22:16.192 --> 22:21.639
I have an address book that's migrated over the last 25 years with me from one system to another.

22:21.659 --> 22:29.770
It can be done, but it's expensive and labor intensive, and it doesn't always work, particularly when paradigms change.

22:30.471 --> 22:32.473
I'll talk about that in a minute.

22:32.493 --> 22:36.058
The problem is, for the most,

22:36.983 --> 22:41.551
Central problem here is that we're really not smart enough yet to define ultimate standards.

22:41.571 --> 22:44.676
We're still learning what information science and computer science is about.

22:45.057 --> 22:53.932
We really don't have good models yet for what the categories are, let alone what the ultimate canonical representation for each of these categories also be.

22:54.492 --> 23:01.945
So to think that we can develop a long-lived standard that means something that lasts more than five or ten years in the foreseeable future just seems to be unrealistic.

23:02.667 --> 23:07.836
It's a nice idea, it may happen eventually, but not in the foreseeable future.

23:08.518 --> 23:14.469
The other idea of using successive evolving standards means that you have to convert or translate each time you change standards.

23:15.110 --> 23:25.148
And this is, there are a lot of analogies, but this one is a parlor game where you whisper, somebody whispers a sentence into someone's ear and you whisper it into the next person's ear, and by the eighth or ninth person it's unintelligible.

23:25.887 --> 23:37.263
Another that I like would be, suppose you have, but all we have in the Iliad were translations that have been translated from the ancient Greek through every intermediate language that has existed since then and now.

23:37.283 --> 23:43.512
We would have something that might conceivably be a story about the Zacchaeus of Rome, but of the Troy, but it would certainly not be what we think of as the Iliad.

23:44.093 --> 23:46.997
And that's not in fact what scholars do when they translate the Iliad.

23:47.017 --> 23:48.739
They try to find the oldest text.

23:49.343 --> 24:18.557
valid text that they can and translate correctly from that precisely because this continuous corruption problem every time you translate something you're going to corrupt it an even more extreme example that i like is suppose that sometime in the future english had taken over the planet and you decided to translate everything in your repository in english and suppose one of the things in your repository was a french spanish dictionary translate both halves of it lined up with two rather mediocre english things of dictionaries

24:18.908 --> 24:27.985
And the problem is that in order to avoid that sort of thing with migration, you would have to know what everything in your collection is, what it means, what is important about it.

24:28.206 --> 24:33.075
So you have to actually look at the semantics of everything to decide what's the right thing to do with it.

24:33.576 --> 24:35.540
And that seems to me is just wildly labor intensive.

24:35.841 --> 24:41.271
The other problem standards is someone, I think it was Andrew Tannenbaum,

24:41.622 --> 24:46.029
The great thing about standards is that there are so many different ones to choose from.

24:46.049 --> 24:55.004
Here's a website that purports to list every standard three or four or five character file name extension that's in use by some piece of software out there.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.667
There are about over a thousand on this page.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.533
And the very first one I went to look for here was Mr. Sims.

25:00.593 --> 25:02.637
Somebody told me about it a week after I made this slide up.

25:02.657 --> 25:03.478
And it's not on there.

25:04.201 --> 25:05.963
So there are lots and lots of standards.

25:06.123 --> 25:09.066
And the problem is standards don't evolve very fast.

25:09.146 --> 25:10.628
They don't get solidified very fast.

25:10.688 --> 25:13.171
By the time they do, they tend to be obsolete.

25:13.731 --> 25:14.853
So there are serious problems.

25:14.973 --> 25:19.137
Even though standards are good work, it's important stuff to do.

25:19.478 --> 25:31.491
And finding the right level of standard can sometimes really be a big win, like SML or HTML or XML, that are standards at sort of the right location for PCPIP for that matter.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.741
OK, so the standards approach is a difficult one.

25:35.262 --> 25:41.092
And the problems that I've been suggesting here suggest that really what you need is to run original software somehow.

25:41.914 --> 25:46.201
You can't just translate things into future standard forms and expect future software to work.

25:46.662 --> 25:49.547
So that means that you're going to somehow save the original software.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.073
That's not hard because software is just a bunch of bits.

25:52.473 --> 25:57.079
If you can save a digital document, which is a bunch of bits, you can save a piece of software, just a different bunch of bits.

25:57.580 --> 26:02.506
The hard part, however, is that the software only runs on hardware, which is also obsolete in the future.

26:03.026 --> 26:04.188
So how do you do that?

26:05.930 --> 26:13.720
You either save old computers in museums somehow, or you do something else.

26:14.761 --> 26:19.247
Save old computers is kind of a romantic idea, but

26:19.480 --> 26:21.702
It really isn't realistic for lots and lots of reasons.

26:21.722 --> 26:24.044
I won't go into much detail here, but I'll just mention two.

26:24.204 --> 26:32.852
One is that if you had a 100-year-old document in your repository, it would not still be on its original medium because that medium would have physically died long ago.

26:32.892 --> 26:37.156
So you would have migrated, say, an eight-inch floppy document onto a CD or a DVD.

26:37.676 --> 26:45.543
If you have the old computer in your museum, it doesn't have a DVD drive, so you can't even put the migrated version of the data file into the old computer.

26:45.984 --> 26:47.445
You've got to build interfaces

26:47.543 --> 26:52.288
software drivers between all of the old machines in your museum and all of your new I.O.

26:52.348 --> 26:54.591
devices and it's completely unmanageable.

26:54.671 --> 26:57.574
You'd have to retain expertise for writing software for those things.

26:57.614 --> 26:58.175
This doesn't even work.

26:58.535 --> 27:01.158
Furthermore, hardware itself doesn't really last all that long.

27:01.879 --> 27:06.604
There are all sorts of mechanisms by which integrated circuits actually decay over time.

27:08.186 --> 27:15.053
So the solution that I've been suggesting now for about eight years is to rely on emulation and

27:15.404 --> 27:16.505
Paul mentioned what this is.

27:16.846 --> 27:18.488
I'll define emulation in general.

27:18.568 --> 27:23.235
An emulator is something that performs the function of something else.

27:23.555 --> 27:27.741
Usually it's either a computer, a piece of hardware, or a program.

27:27.981 --> 27:30.604
And I'll focus on the use of programs that actually can be hardware.

27:30.885 --> 27:37.073
For instance, you've probably seen terminals that claim they do BT100 emulation or IBM something or other emulation.

27:37.093 --> 27:41.940
And that just means the hardware or the firmware in the terminal is actually emulating a different piece of hardware.

27:42.761 --> 27:45.124
I'll note that emulation is not the same as simulation.

27:45.678 --> 27:47.982
An airplane simulator does not leave the ground.

27:48.844 --> 27:49.585
It does not fly.

27:49.605 --> 27:53.973
A simulator tells you what a system would do, but it doesn't do it for you.

27:54.234 --> 27:58.441
An emulator actually does what a system in question would have done.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.327
It replaces it in some limited context.

28:02.669 --> 28:09.762
Now, why would you want to emulate hardware as opposed to just, say, writing programs in the future that emulate old software?

28:10.332 --> 28:18.043
Well, we decided we have to actually run a document's original software and that we know how to save software because it's just a bunch of disks.

28:18.724 --> 28:24.172
Well, it turns out hardware emulation is a well-understood computer science technique, also been in use for 30 years or so.

28:25.114 --> 28:27.497
Most new machines actually are emulated before they're built.

28:28.237 --> 28:37.991
And when Pentium comes out, Intel wants to design the Pentium before building it, they'll write an emulator that runs on their previous machine, a 486, that emulates the Pentium that doesn't exist yet.

28:38.411 --> 28:42.377
They'll get some of the bugs out, not all of them as it turns out, but they'll get some of the bugs out.

28:42.397 --> 28:47.224
They'll even start writing firmware for it before they build any silica, before they actually generate a chip.

28:48.098 --> 28:50.021
Similarly, it's been used in the opposite direction.

28:50.041 --> 28:54.407
IBM for years would provide emulators for backward compatibility with older systems.

28:54.427 --> 28:56.810
The IBM 360 had an emulator for the 7090.

28:56.911 --> 28:59.975
I don't know if there's anybody in the room old enough to remember the 7090.

29:00.596 --> 29:06.885
And so that meant a bank that had a lot of investment in old software and the older machine didn't have to rewrite it all to buy the new machine.

29:06.925 --> 29:08.447
They just ran the new machine with an emulator.

29:09.128 --> 29:17.700
More recently, if anybody uses Macintoshes, the PowerPC Macintosh has included an emulator for the older Motorola 68000 chip inside it since it was released.

29:17.680 --> 29:26.711
And in fact, large portions of the Mac OS ran under emulation until I think it was version 8.6 or 9.0 of Mac OS.

29:27.392 --> 29:29.355
So this is a technique that's in use all the time.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.376
We know how to do this.

29:30.837 --> 29:42.912
The big advantage is that if we do it for anything, if we decide that there's any document that's worth preserving in this original form, then once we create an emulator for the machine on which that document ran,

29:43.330 --> 29:45.855
We can get everything else that ran on that machine for free.

29:45.875 --> 29:50.964
We just saved the software that was associated with the documents, and we saved the software in their original bid forms.

29:50.984 --> 29:54.971
And then we automatically transported everything from that platform into the future.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.335
Now, I'm being a little blue.

29:57.476 --> 30:01.643
There are some technical challenges to doing this, but the effort

30:01.943 --> 30:04.986
involved in doing this is really quite remarkable.

30:05.166 --> 30:16.076
All you have to do, if you take an approach that I'm being a little eliding a little bit here, I suggest an approach that relies on the use of a virtual machine, and I won't go into what that means.

30:16.096 --> 30:20.460
It's just a quick way of getting an emulator interpreter to run on future systems.

30:21.040 --> 30:30.769
If we create such a thing, we only need to create one port or implementation of that thing for each older platform.

30:31.137 --> 30:32.438
as it becomes obsolete.

30:32.518 --> 30:40.266
That is, we created an emulator for each old platform, and we implemented on each new platform.

30:40.487 --> 30:43.430
We do essentially one of each for each platform.

30:43.450 --> 30:50.958
We describe the platform as my emulator that we'll run in the future, and we port this interpreter for our older emulators on the new platform.

30:51.378 --> 31:00.047
Having done that and writing essentially two programs for each platform, we're done for the history of that platform, for the five years or however long it is that that platform lasts.

31:00.382 --> 31:08.337
This is incredibly high leverage as compared to, say, translating or even looking at all of the documents in a repository.

31:08.698 --> 31:11.784
What would this look like in terms of what you save in a repository?

31:12.084 --> 31:23.706
You would save not only the document itself, but the original software that created that document, including all the context, the operating system that went with it, and a hardware description for the platform that it ran on.

31:24.142 --> 31:28.009
Now I've shown this encapsulated logically in a circle here.

31:28.289 --> 31:34.720
You wouldn't necessarily save a copy of a hardware description and save Microsoft Windows with every document that you save.

31:35.081 --> 31:36.122
This is a logical view.

31:36.142 --> 31:42.353
You would probably save those things once in your repository or even a national repository and link to them out of this

31:42.333 --> 31:43.174
encapsulation.

31:43.475 --> 31:51.005
But conceptually speaking, what you have here is a document with all of the software and hardware description necessary to recreate it in the future.

31:51.025 --> 32:01.159
You'd also have reference information here, indexing and anything else that you need to actually use the thing and you have to be able to open it up and use it in some way in the future.

32:01.179 --> 32:03.782
Now, problems, well, yeah.

32:04.503 --> 32:05.384
There are some issues.

32:05.464 --> 32:11.833
For one, it means that someone in 200 years might open a current document, a 1990s document in Microsoft Word.

32:12.337 --> 32:14.359
which presumably won't exist in 100 years.

32:15.140 --> 32:21.347
So they'll have to run this obsolete software under an old obsolete hardware environment and operating systems environment.

32:22.048 --> 32:28.355
And that's kind of an off thing to make a reader do until you realize it's very analogous to reading an ancient manuscript.

32:28.856 --> 32:37.645
You save the original and by so doing, you make it the case that only scholars are likely to have the expertise necessary to access that thing directly.

32:37.665 --> 32:38.226
However,

32:38.662 --> 32:48.355
You then need to create, skipping a little third point here, you can create used copies or vernacular translations or renditions of the original from the original at each epic and time.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.638
This is the way we do with, you know, this ancient thing.

32:50.998 --> 32:53.481
When I want to read the Shakespeare sonnets, I don't usually go to the Folger.

32:53.802 --> 33:01.712
I go to Wallman's books and I buy a $5 paperback edition of the sonnets, which someone has thoughtfully transcribed into modern typography, spelling, and punctuation for me.

33:01.732 --> 33:03.114
And that's fine for both purposes.

33:03.534 --> 33:05.497
But if I want to see the original, I go to the Folger.

33:06.999 --> 33:07.099
Okay.

33:07.248 --> 33:14.756
Now, we also have to make sure the bit streams don't get changed, both the bit streams of documents themselves and the programs and the hardware description.

33:14.776 --> 33:16.939
And we may have to emulate more than just processors.

33:16.959 --> 33:28.932
I mean, when I say emulating 68,000 processors, there are other issues that have to be worried about the entire platform, I-O devices and peripherals and such.

33:28.952 --> 33:31.655
But none of that is essentially very difficult.

33:31.675 --> 33:37.221
And as I said, we require one emulator description and one emulated environment per platform.

33:37.538 --> 33:41.483
So that's a cost, but it's a per-platform cost, not a per-document cost.

33:42.684 --> 33:45.208
Now you might ask, is this real?

33:45.288 --> 33:45.929
Can this be done?

33:47.010 --> 33:54.800
And I'll point out a couple of what I think of as natural experiments, but it's places where relevant things are already happening.

33:55.020 --> 34:06.955
One, in the Macintosh world, when the software is distributed, it's always distributed with some kind of installation instructions, and to make sure you can read those instructions, they include a copy of old text editor, simple text,

34:07.323 --> 34:08.985
and make sure that you can read the README file.

34:10.267 --> 34:15.633
That's an example of bundling the software with a document so that you're sure you have the right software.

34:15.994 --> 34:20.579
It's not an example of emulation, but it's an example of the encapsulation idea.

34:20.599 --> 34:25.345
Similarly, JPL has a wonderful set of CDs out from Mars data that I got a couple of years ago.

34:26.066 --> 34:30.792
When I opened it up, I noticed that it used Adobe Reader version 2.

34:30.812 --> 34:34.456
I don't really install version 3 on that system, so I thought, well, I'll just read it with version 3.

34:34.496 --> 34:35.237
They wouldn't let me.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.064
And I realized, oh, that's actually very clever of them.

34:38.364 --> 34:40.688
They didn't know what version 3 was going to be when they released this.

34:40.728 --> 34:42.872
They couldn't guarantee that it would still read their data.

34:43.313 --> 34:49.564
So they included a copy of version 2, and furthermore, they prevented you from reading their data with anything but the software that they gave you.

34:50.906 --> 34:55.895
A similar example of bundling in the DOS world, many of you use pkzip files.

34:56.336 --> 34:58.660
There's a way of building a copy of the

34:58.893 --> 35:06.259
decompressor into the file so that it's an executable thing, so that you don't have to worry about keeping the decompressor PKO zip around.

35:06.579 --> 35:08.401
It just gets bundled into the document itself.

35:09.142 --> 35:11.223
So that's sort of the encapsulation side.

35:11.644 --> 35:16.448
On the emulate side, we talked about some examples where manufacturers have done this.

35:16.468 --> 35:20.812
There's also a wonderful natural experiment occurring in what I call the retrocomputing subculture.

35:21.432 --> 35:28.478
These are people who go out and find old game cartridges for Ataris and Commodores and things at garage sales.

35:28.930 --> 35:38.755
And they bring it home, and then they find on the network, they write or download off the network these emulators for those old platforms that run on their current Pentium or Macintosh systems.

35:39.494 --> 35:44.459
And here's just one website that had, a year or two ago, had a list of these emulators that you could download.

35:44.479 --> 35:46.902
These are running emulators that someone else has written before you.

35:47.242 --> 35:52.067
You just download this, then you have to figure out how to get bits out of this game cartridge for which you no longer have a reader.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.351
So these people build all sorts of Google Word devices for doing that.

35:55.671 --> 35:59.935
These are people with more time on their hands than I seem to have.

35:59.955 --> 36:00.816
But it works.

36:02.298 --> 36:05.481
Another example, I showed you this picture previously.

36:05.501 --> 36:09.045
This is an ERWin, which as I said is a program that only runs under

36:09.430 --> 36:21.505
Microsoft Windows, but if you look at the top of the screen here, you'll notice it was actually running on my Macintosh under emulation, a program called Soft Windows, which creates a virtual Pentium system on the desktop running Windows.

36:21.525 --> 36:24.729
And Erwin, the program, had no idea it was running on a Macintosh.

36:24.749 --> 36:29.595
It would have been very upset if it hadn't.

36:29.615 --> 36:31.978
Finally, just to show you that this scales over time,

36:32.313 --> 36:38.462
The very first operational electronic computer, although there's a lot of arguments about this, but it seems enough to settle.

36:38.962 --> 36:41.506
It seems to have been the ESSAC in 1949 in Britain.

36:42.227 --> 36:43.829
And this is a picture of the machine.

36:43.889 --> 36:51.900
And actually, you can't really see it very well, but there's a console over here somewhere, which is where you sat and actually used the machine.

36:52.381 --> 36:57.328
And someone has very thoughtfully created an emulator for that very first electronic digital computer.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.594
So here we have, in the center of the screen, we have facts.

37:02.958 --> 37:15.089
platform emulated, a little graphical interface here, running the program which was written in 1952 for that system, which played tic-tac-toe, or was it the drops of an ounce or something, what the British call it.

37:15.109 --> 37:17.291
And here's a little game that I started there.

37:17.591 --> 37:18.993
Hopefully I can play it interactively.

37:19.673 --> 37:28.862
So this is, if you will, a 1952 document in its original digital format, this game, interactive, of course, but that's the point for a lot of digital artifacts and documents.

37:28.882 --> 37:31.564
And now you'll notice this emulator is running

37:32.084 --> 37:42.241
in what looks like a Macintosh environment, and it actually is a Macintosh, but that emulator only runs under a 68,000 Macintosh, the older Macintosh.

37:42.341 --> 37:44.364
It doesn't run under a Motorola Macintosh.

37:44.825 --> 37:55.442
So I'm actually running this Macintosh emulator under soft windows, or virtual PC in this case, which is a Windows emulator.

37:56.013 --> 37:59.678
that's running on my Macintosh PowerPC.

37:59.698 --> 38:03.163
So you're looking at three levels that emulate it here.

38:03.303 --> 38:15.119
I'm running a Macintosh PowerPC that's emulating a Windows Pentium system running Windows that's emulating a 68,000 Macintosh running Mac OS 7 point something that's emulating an headset.

38:15.139 --> 38:20.586
This works and in fact runs faster than the original machine.

38:21.140 --> 38:32.820
This is one way, at least, this isn't actually the most efficient way you would do this, but this is one way that you could ensure that as successive generations of machines came along, you would emulate each successive generation.

38:32.840 --> 38:44.059
And at the very worst, you would be able to run previous emulators under your successive emulators and run your old documents and you would just see, you know, in about as close as imaginable a form to the original.

38:44.461 --> 38:51.330
Now there are issues to worry about here about screen resolution and color and all sorts of other details which have to be taken into account.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.653
But this is the approach in a nutshell.

38:54.294 --> 38:57.698
Now let me just compare, summarize, emulation with migration.

38:58.700 --> 39:05.789
And I kind of characterize migration as a strategy based on faith or wishful thinking.

39:05.809 --> 39:07.751
And I don't really mean that to be derogatory.

39:08.132 --> 39:10.755
I've done plenty of migration in my own career.

39:11.156 --> 39:14.400
But the problem with it is I can't predict what's going to happen in five years.

39:15.173 --> 39:16.855
I'm a computer scientist.

39:16.875 --> 39:23.163
I think of myself as a reasonably predictive character, but I'm not going to try to follow what will happen in five years.

39:23.823 --> 39:28.970
And therefore, I don't know what I'm going to have to do in five years to migrate all the documents in my collection.

39:29.310 --> 39:37.880
They are in some set of formats right now, a whole range of formats, probably in all sorts of proprietary as well as standard formats.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.745
It's very difficult to constrain people to keep them to using standard formats.

39:41.765 --> 39:42.666
It's been tried.

39:42.865 --> 39:51.598
some examples in the military where it's been dictated that people use only standard forms and people just ignore it because they have to work with colleagues who are using all sorts of other formats.

39:51.899 --> 39:54.883
So there's going to be this multitude of proprietary formats.

39:54.903 --> 39:58.729
I don't know what I'm going to have to do to migrate each individual one of those in five years.

39:59.070 --> 40:00.532
I just know I'm going to have to do something.

40:00.973 --> 40:04.097
It's going to be probably different for each one of the formats in my collection.

40:05.139 --> 40:11.168
I don't know how much I'm going to lose, how successful I'm going to be, which things I'm just going to give up on, throw my hands up, and say this can't be done.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.114
Furthermore, it has to be applied to every individual document.

40:16.716 --> 40:24.285
Even though, of course, in most collections, certainly in archives, probably even in libraries, a large percentage of the collection isn't actually accessed in many given the five-year period.

40:24.846 --> 40:29.031
But probably every five years or so, you're going to have to take each individual document and migrate it.

40:29.351 --> 40:36.600
Understand what it is, what its semantics is, what its constraints are, how to convert it without loss, and do the best you can to do it in Murray.

40:36.620 --> 40:39.484
So it's very expensive in terms of looking at individual documents.

40:40.072 --> 40:45.059
It may be different for each kind of format, each type of document, or required specialized handling.

40:45.699 --> 40:54.772
Anything that's in a non-standard form that's been left orphaned by history and left along the wayside will probably not get converted or will get completely corrupted in the process.

40:55.753 --> 41:00.239
Migration schedules, it's easy to say we'll do this every five years, but you don't always have five years.

41:00.639 --> 41:09.471
If a company goes out of business a moment after you've just done one migration cycle, you may not have five years to keep running a program or the hardware that it depended on.

41:09.721 --> 41:14.903
On the other hand, in comparison, emulation mostly requires that you do something upfront.

41:14.923 --> 41:20.305
That is, you create this emulation environment for a platform that a person created, and you can actually test.

41:20.622 --> 41:22.044
whether preservation will work.

41:22.404 --> 41:27.831
Because someone gives you a document, and you try running its original software both in its original form and under emulation.

41:28.272 --> 41:36.822
You don't have a future machine to try it on yet, but you try it on some other current machine, and you can actually, we've actually done this in an environment at the Dutch National Library.

41:37.023 --> 41:48.537
We put things up side by side and looked at the emulated version of the CD-Roth publication next to the native original form, and convinced ourselves that they look identical enough for preservation purposes, and you're done.

41:48.517 --> 41:51.761
Once you've done that, you put the thing in the repository and you never have to look at it again.

41:52.002 --> 41:55.526
You know that it's going to come out correctly if you emulate it correctly.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.868
That's the argument.

41:56.888 --> 41:59.552
I will put up with one final example.

41:59.572 --> 42:04.158
I talked about the CD-ROM example we did at the Dutch National Library.

42:04.178 --> 42:04.598
Here it is.

42:04.618 --> 42:08.363
I think it was an Elsevier publication.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.004
I can't remember.

42:09.565 --> 42:13.871
The CD-ROM that does marine planarians of the world.

42:14.432 --> 42:14.872
Planaria.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.055
That was a silly one on the outside.

42:17.643 --> 42:23.370
And this was a good example because it installed lots and lots of application software when you installed it under Windows.

42:24.091 --> 42:30.839
So it installed a special browser plug-ins and all sorts of stuff so that you could display it.

42:31.120 --> 42:37.748
And it did that under emulation, running it under virtual PC, which is a commercially available emulator for the Windows platform.

42:37.768 --> 42:41.032
So this is just an example of the fact that this can be done.

42:41.893 --> 42:47.059
And that's why I suggest that this might work as a preservation technique.

43:00.843 --> 43:08.418
OK, at this time, I'd like to invite Paul Conway and Matt Eaton and Jeff Rothenberg to our panel table.

43:08.439 --> 43:15.072
And also, since he assures me he has things to say on this issue, we're going to bring Walt Crawford back.

43:30.239 --> 43:37.069
Several noted experts discussing the issues surrounding digital preservation.

43:37.090 --> 43:45.442
Moderating the panel discussion will be Jan Merrill-Boldham, the Malloy-Rabinowitz Preservation Librarian at Harvard University Library.

43:46.905 --> 43:58.963
In that position, Jan directs the work of the Wiseman Preservation Center in the Harvard University Library and the Preservation and Imaging Services Department in the Harvard College Library.

44:00.158 --> 44:11.851
Together, these programs provide conservation, micro-building, digitizing, photography, and consulting services to the more than 90 libraries at Harvard University.

44:13.233 --> 44:27.769
Over the course of her career, Janet has chaired and served on a wide range of preservation planning and advisory committees and task forces for the American Library Association, the Association of Research Libraries, the Library of Congress,

44:28.120 --> 44:33.367
Commission on Preservation and Access, and other professional organizations.

44:33.387 --> 44:40.095
In great demand as a speaker, Jan is also a gifted author who has written and edited more than 40 publications.

44:40.776 --> 44:47.985
Uniquely qualified to lead us through this final segment of the program, it's my pleasure to introduce my friend Jan Carol Oldenburg.

44:56.875 --> 45:26.595
what we would like to do rather than run a formal panel is to open up the floor to questions from you because if we don't do that now we're really not going to have time and I can imagine we probably have questions

45:29.528 --> 45:29.989
Shall I?

45:30.609 --> 45:30.930
Yes.

45:32.491 --> 45:38.899
And please identify yourself and let us know to whom you're addressing the question.

45:40.841 --> 45:42.383
My name is Aidy Benson.

45:42.403 --> 45:43.544
I work at Nellinit.

45:43.564 --> 45:45.407
And I have a question for Jeff Rothenberg.

45:45.427 --> 45:56.059
I just wondered if you have run into or considered or there's something out there about proprietary problems with emulation and if you're encapsulating software that one

45:57.085 --> 46:04.151
Yeah, that is an issue.

46:04.171 --> 46:09.616
I had to gloss over a number of issues, and that's one of them.

46:09.636 --> 46:19.245
On one hand, you'd sort of like to think that by the time it becomes necessary to use software for this purpose in the future, it's already off the market, and so there is an issue.

46:19.265 --> 46:27.092
On the other hand, it's using it in the future of this market lifetime, and therefore the copyright claim, especially with the copyright laws.

46:27.072 --> 46:31.400
So there is an issue there, and I think that has to be work.

46:31.981 --> 46:39.034
That is in the realm of public policy, and there are issues that have to be set in place for this kind of system to work.

46:39.635 --> 46:47.950
And similarly, the software, even the hardware descriptions might be considered proprietary, so you do have to worry about that.

46:47.930 --> 46:54.439
Now you can, of course, finesse that by saying, well, we'll just use viewers instead of using original software.

46:54.459 --> 47:04.111
Then you're right back in the situation of not using your correct software.

47:04.131 --> 47:04.432
Yeah.

47:10.280 --> 47:15.106
Alex Boyenberger, the Cedars Project, Cambridge University Library.

47:15.667 --> 47:16.688
We were wondering,

47:16.972 --> 47:28.852
whether, this would be for Dr. Conway, whether you felt that the use of emulation and migration are complementary or mutually exclusive.

47:32.979 --> 47:41.654
Can I say yes?

47:42.055 --> 47:42.135
Yes.

47:42.554 --> 47:59.776
In preparing for this day, my thinking coming in to this day, and I've been listening as carefully as everybody else about this, it seems to me that emulation was a subset of migration, that the umbrella was movement from one to another.

47:59.836 --> 48:06.925
Jeff, in a sense, confirmed my view a little bit when he said that one way or the other, you still have a data copying issue because the media

48:07.310 --> 48:08.934
At some point, you're copying.

48:09.475 --> 48:14.627
And in copying, there's the promise of exact replication, but not necessarily.

48:14.908 --> 48:17.434
It's another article of faith.

48:17.454 --> 48:19.058
But now that I

48:19.460 --> 48:26.969
I've listened carefully, and what I find takeaway from this is that they're more complimentary than not.

48:27.029 --> 48:39.204
There may be occasions when the copying of individual documents and applying a rigorous selection process to decide what lives and what dies is going to be the way we're going to want to go.

48:39.264 --> 48:44.050
And then there's others of do it once or a class of materials, a database.

48:44.840 --> 48:47.744
that requires holistic maintenance in its form.

48:47.784 --> 48:52.089
The selection doesn't work because you can't select one document or another.

48:52.109 --> 48:55.574
You're selecting a corpus to move forward and you emulate.

48:55.594 --> 49:01.321
So emulation, it seems to me, feels right when selection cannot be applied to the document.

49:01.562 --> 49:05.968
But migration feels right when it's right to select.

49:06.188 --> 49:09.012
And then you're back to two-tier selection.

49:09.472 --> 49:12.476
When do we emulate and when do we migrate?

49:13.077 --> 49:14.779
Annette, could you comment on this question?

49:15.046 --> 49:25.600
And Jeff talked about... Jeff compared migration and emulation, but you did not... No, he did not have any experience with it.

49:26.081 --> 49:31.849
What I was basically doing in my presentation was talking about actual experience, what has happened up to now.

49:32.349 --> 49:42.403
I am very much intrigued by what Jeff talks about, and I was hoping that we could actually use meth Smithsonian, but we were not able to take advantage of it when it came to talk about it.

49:42.805 --> 49:44.988
I think it's something I'd like to see attached.

49:45.188 --> 49:49.353
And I think Jeff's found a couple of small places where it's been done, but not that much.

49:49.373 --> 49:55.300
So with everything, what I want to see is, rather than just talking about it, I want to see people doing things.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.145
And I want us to have failures, so we know we don't go that direction.

49:59.165 --> 50:01.007
But I also want us to have some successes.

50:01.027 --> 50:03.950
So I don't know if I'm answering your question the right way or not.

50:04.130 --> 50:06.093
I just think we need to do stuff.

50:06.113 --> 50:07.935
Jeff, can you answer some of

50:08.135 --> 50:15.590
some of your critics, because there have been some interesting counterpoints to various publications.

50:16.552 --> 50:27.814
Let me just first make one other comment that I guess I didn't make when I was up there, which is that I certainly don't see the approaches as mutually exclusive, but I do see them as having rather

50:28.300 --> 50:35.094
drastically different outcomes in the sense that emulation, if it works, will preserve an original.

50:35.935 --> 50:38.100
Migration, even if it works, will not.

50:39.102 --> 50:42.910
And nobody who's talking about migration is claiming that it will preserve the original.

50:43.310 --> 50:46.056
What we talk about is converting the original success

50:46.728 --> 50:54.876
So if that's what you mean by preservation, if by preservation you mean preserving originals, then migration isn't really a solution to that problem.

50:54.896 --> 51:07.749
On the other hand, if what you mean by preservation is preserving usable forms of things for various purposes, which is after all what most of us mean pragmatically by preservation, then migration is certainly an option.

51:07.769 --> 51:09.331
But I do want to comment on that.

51:09.351 --> 51:12.093
There have been a number of objections.

51:12.153 --> 51:16.718
I tried to bring a number of them up as I went along.

51:16.951 --> 51:25.922
One is, of course, the imperative that people need to be able to run and use obsolete hardware and software in order to read things in the future.

51:25.942 --> 51:35.094
And as I said, I find that entirely analogous to looking at old medieval documents and needing to have some scholarly expertise to do that in the original.

51:35.114 --> 51:43.545
And there's no problem at all with using emulation to allow creating the use copies at each period in time.

51:43.565 --> 51:45.287
And people have said, well, that's just migration.

51:45.588 --> 52:09.132
but the distinction is you're doing that from the original on each occurrence rather than doing it successively over time so if there's corruption going on you corrupt may corrupt the used copy but 10 years later when you create a new use copy you're not going to go back to the original you make a different corruption in a new one you won't accumulate the corruption error so that's that's that distinction another objection that's been brought up is that

52:09.550 --> 52:12.875
You know, this requires saving bits perfectly.

52:13.056 --> 52:20.948
You know, that you think you copy things perfectly, but you never get 100% perfection.

52:22.070 --> 52:22.951
Well, yes, that's true.

52:22.991 --> 52:24.433
Things will be great that way.

52:24.794 --> 52:29.902
And software is notoriously unforgiving of small changes.

52:29.922 --> 52:34.950
If you change bits in the wrong place in a program, it may just never work again, and that might be that.

52:35.183 --> 52:37.847
So that just says that nothing is perfect.

52:37.867 --> 52:40.831
Human life, human existence is a problem of uncertainty.

52:41.272 --> 52:46.960
And this is not an absolute perfect solution either, but with reasonable care.

52:46.980 --> 52:54.070
And it's one of these things where if you want to be more certain that your copy fits perfectly well, you pay more money and you do more verification and you're a little more careful.

52:54.611 --> 52:56.173
It's a question of how risk averse you are.

52:59.338 --> 53:02.362
I think if there are any other major objections that have been brought up.

53:02.382 --> 53:04.245
It's often brought up, but it sounds expensive.

53:04.782 --> 53:17.375
And I've tried to indicate here that I think it would actually be considerably cheaper than a migration alternative because it's something you do per platform rather than per document or even per document type.

53:18.376 --> 53:27.706
Suppose you have a dozen or so, at most, popular computer platforms that you use at a given moment.

53:27.726 --> 53:31.870
Sparks and PPCs and Pentiums and a few others.

53:32.305 --> 53:35.609
you have thousands of programs that run on those platforms.

53:35.629 --> 53:42.257
So if you needed to understand how to convert the format of each of those programs, you'd have thousands of times the effort.

53:42.277 --> 53:47.863
And you have millions of documents for each, potentially for each of those program formats.

53:48.424 --> 53:54.511
So if you had to convert into the documents and understand what the problems were, you'd have actually millions of times the effort.

53:54.531 --> 53:58.836
So I think in terms of cost, it's tremendously cheaper, at least in principle.

54:00.402 --> 54:06.464
Can you imagine feeling up to really test emulation as a strategy?

54:06.865 --> 54:11.442
Do you have a vision for how we might really put emulation to work on a large scale?

54:12.198 --> 54:17.705
We actually, I published a report last year with the Dutch National Archives.

54:17.725 --> 54:19.187
It's done through RAND Europe with .

54:19.327 --> 54:24.033
And some of you may know, it's worked in the electronic records community, mostly the international community.

54:24.714 --> 54:30.821
And we wrote for them a specification for a test bit, which they have just put out.

54:31.282 --> 54:35.187
They've just awarded a call for tender for someone to implement that.

54:35.207 --> 54:39.572
It used to be a three-year project in which they will actually run controlled experiments.

54:39.552 --> 54:52.309
comparing emulation, migration, and any other preservative form that they decide along the way, but particularly those two, on again, a test scale, but trying to do it a little more seriously than just anecdotal.

54:53.151 --> 55:01.422
So there is that project, and there's Cedar's work, which my understanding is, is planning to look at emulating, at least to some extent.

55:02.603 --> 55:07.450
Well, I guess if I want to take issue with anything there, the one that is

55:08.510 --> 55:21.730
When you say it's free for everything, everything I heard you say implied that emulation in fact involved necessary migration of the media themselves, in which case it isn't free for everything.

55:21.870 --> 55:28.881
Emulating a, not a 68,000 Mac, but emulating an Apple II,

55:29.367 --> 55:39.435
on the Pentium is probably feasible, except for the issue of reading things from, well, not Apple II, but the 8-inch his guests, for example.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.280
And what do you do about that?

55:41.300 --> 55:43.226
Because then you no longer have the original.

55:43.246 --> 55:44.710
You have a version of the original.

55:44.690 --> 55:53.168
As I said at the beginning of the talk, nothing in my talk should be construed as subverting the need to copy the bits from medium to medium.

55:53.509 --> 56:00.443
That is a constant cost across any preservation medium, any preservation approach, except the one that says we won't preserve.

56:00.924 --> 56:02.327
We preserve by throwing away.

56:02.459 --> 56:07.125
Any other approach that I can imagine requires saving, at least saving the bits.

56:07.566 --> 56:09.508
If not the original bits, then the converted bits.

56:09.588 --> 56:11.511
But it requires saving bit streams over time.

56:11.791 --> 56:16.117
So I agree that cost has to be varied in any preservation technique.

56:16.137 --> 56:22.084
And in the case of the case you cite, the point is that you don't have the original medium.

56:22.365 --> 56:24.648
You have the original logical contents of the medium.

56:24.708 --> 56:26.049
You have the bit stream intact.

56:26.430 --> 56:29.534
What you copy is the bit image off the Apple II disk.

56:30.155 --> 56:31.116
You do have to give up.

56:31.568 --> 56:43.609
that we have to give up because we just can't physically retain those things.

56:43.630 --> 56:46.154
That is a caveat.

56:47.036 --> 56:54.589
But if you give that up and you say that what the essence of an original digital thing is its digital nature

56:54.957 --> 56:58.745
logical form, not the thing that happens to be stored on me.

56:58.765 --> 57:02.633
After all, I have documents that are stored on lots of different media all at once.

57:03.335 --> 57:04.097
Who's to stay with it?

57:04.137 --> 57:11.312
The original is my Zip disk or the Spark disk on my workstation or any email server or whatever.
