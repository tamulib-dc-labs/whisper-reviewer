Alice Hoffman. You know you and I did do an interview before. That's right. You don't remember but it was I think it was important but it was a really long time ago. I don't remember anything. It was illumination night. Yeah and that was a pretty significant book for you wasn't it? I guess that was the first book that you wrote after you had had children is that right? Yeah. Did you find that that

00:31.553 --> 00:34.676
affected the course of your creative reviews?

00:34.796 --> 00:35.256
Completely.

00:35.817 --> 00:50.150
I mean, first of all, it made me write much more quickly than I had written before, you know, just in terms of speed, portioning the day, you know, and having to, you know, fit writing in instead of fit your life around writing.

00:50.170 --> 00:51.932
It was kind of the reverse, you know.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.474
Well, the discipline, but how about in terms of content?

00:54.554 --> 00:56.156
Completely changed it.

00:56.176 --> 00:59.919
I feel like I crossed over to some line and, you know, went to the other side.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.480
I went from

01:00.713 --> 01:05.258
the child's kind of point of view to the parents point of view.

01:05.538 --> 01:07.661
I feel like I totally crossed over.

01:07.741 --> 01:09.503
But children still remain very much.

01:09.963 --> 01:17.552
Yeah, I do write about children a lot, but I still feel like my allegiance changed.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.315
From what to what?

01:20.715 --> 01:23.278
From thinking of

01:23.579 --> 01:32.270
myself as a writer and a person as a child to thinking of myself as a writer and a person as a parent.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.393
How about in terms of creating characters?

01:34.513 --> 01:44.807
I really do believe that for me, because I had difficulty in being a parent, it didn't come very easy for me.

01:44.867 --> 01:48.692
It gave me a lot more sympathy and a lot more insight into certain characters.

01:49.297 --> 01:51.259
in life and in fiction both.

01:51.399 --> 01:58.825
I'm not asking you to explain that, but I would say ambiguous when you say it was difficult for you in terms of having children or raising them or what?

01:59.065 --> 02:00.366
I don't know how do you explain it?

02:00.386 --> 02:03.989
Well, just raising them, I just think it's a tremendously difficult thing to do when you make mistakes.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.432
As a child, just think things are black and white.

02:07.913 --> 02:09.134
My parents did this.

02:09.154 --> 02:11.636
This is a mistake.

02:12.056 --> 02:13.678
I just saw the other side.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.479
I saw how you try to do things and fail.

02:15.579 --> 02:18.882
Even with the best intentions,

02:19.452 --> 02:29.963
In your art, do you find now that it's easier or harder to characterize children?

02:30.043 --> 02:33.507
I felt like a child for so long.

02:33.547 --> 02:36.570
I think it's kind of my generation.

02:36.751 --> 02:40.895
It's a long time to grow up so that I feel like I have what it is to be a child down.

02:41.416 --> 02:43.738
What it is to be a parent.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.011
That was what I didn't know.

02:47.551 --> 02:49.954
If you don't mind, we'll jump around the block.

02:49.975 --> 02:50.195
Yeah, sure.

02:50.215 --> 02:50.715
That's good.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.478
But magic really fascinates me.

02:53.158 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.504
My favorite Shakespeare play is The Tempest.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.085
Uh-huh.

02:58.165 --> 03:00.948
Crossbowl is my favorite character, you know, the magician.

03:00.988 --> 03:02.790
I write about him in my book.

03:03.531 --> 03:03.752
Huh.

03:03.792 --> 03:14.485
He's Shakespeare, so I don't think that's... And, of course, one of the concepts... He was Shakespeare's really... He was the character that Shakespeare used to say goodbye to the stage, and he was a magician.

03:15.055 --> 03:23.165
who took books with him off to the island, books and his daughter, that was it, and his one, which at the end he buries his books and his one.

03:23.205 --> 03:27.169
The distinction between good magic and bad magic, I guess, is what I'm driving on.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.953
And I wonder if you feel similarly.

03:29.993 --> 03:31.955
Is there black magic and white magic?

03:31.995 --> 03:35.099
Are there good magicians and bad magicians?

03:35.119 --> 03:42.868
Well, I guess I'm going to, I certainly believe that there's good and evil, but I think, you know, for me,

03:43.068 --> 03:44.334
Oh, thanks.

03:44.395 --> 03:46.425
It is a bird bath, isn't it?

03:46.565 --> 03:46.927
Yeah, it's good.

03:47.611 --> 03:48.234
Stop my line.

03:48.254 --> 03:49.500
Steinbeck used that.

03:49.987 --> 03:51.950
Do you want to order?

03:52.010 --> 03:54.494
Yeah, I think we should.

03:54.514 --> 03:54.895
Okay.

03:55.476 --> 03:58.901
Our soup today is fiery chicken chili.

03:59.021 --> 04:04.890
We've got you today is a grilled brown with a roasted red pepper chicken, please, and again.

04:05.291 --> 04:11.661
Comes with rice and basil, 25, and boxes of black chicken gennichini with a saffron cream sauce.

04:11.681 --> 04:14.205
It has grilled chicken and a little squash.

04:14.995 --> 04:20.202
You know what, I think, just what you were saying, you know, I think good magic is books.

04:20.863 --> 04:21.644
It's mostly books.

04:21.665 --> 04:27.833
I mean, that's what, for me personally, that was the total magic of, you know, being able to escape.

04:27.853 --> 04:29.636
Yeah, I mean, that's what it is, you know.

04:30.016 --> 04:36.025
And I feel like, you know, the first stories that I liked were fairy tales, you know, but the whole experience of reading.

04:36.292 --> 04:42.864
and escaping into a book and, like, reaching a different universe, you know, an alternative universe, you know.

04:42.944 --> 04:49.637
I mean, that to me was the initial magic that, for me personally, rescued me from my, you know, life.

04:50.539 --> 04:52.843
This is prior to you becoming a writer?

04:52.863 --> 04:55.688
Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah.

04:55.728 --> 04:56.730
Why is it...

04:56.997 --> 05:08.233
How is it that you use this subject so often in your writing, the variations of it, this magical sensibility of each other?

05:08.253 --> 05:08.734
Yes.

05:08.754 --> 05:12.599
You know, the thing is, I really don't see it as kind of like magical realism.

05:12.619 --> 05:13.681
I see it as realism.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.904
But a lot of the reviewers are saying this, haven't they?

05:16.124 --> 05:21.672
Yeah, well, you know, I think literature is magic, you know.

05:21.955 --> 05:25.263
It, you know, it's, it's, I think that's sort of a, you know, it's not real.

05:25.323 --> 05:26.105
It's what it's on the paper.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.571
It's doing some kind of conjuring anyway.

05:28.592 --> 05:29.654
It's Shakespeare, you know.

05:30.095 --> 05:34.025
I mean, the poet, the madman and the lover, et cetera, are all the same.

05:34.045 --> 05:37.213
And the poet is like a magician who pulls

05:38.189 --> 05:42.517
I can't do the quote, but it's the great quote on the creative process.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.780
He compares the metaphor as a magician.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.287
Right, and that's what it really, I feel like it is, like to create like Heathcliff or something.

05:48.327 --> 05:49.108
That's not magic.

05:49.128 --> 05:50.991
Yeah, you love Heathcliff.

05:51.011 --> 05:51.893
Yeah, I do.

05:51.993 --> 05:53.255
I see you mentioned him constantly.

05:53.455 --> 05:53.676
Yeah.

05:53.836 --> 05:58.244
Well, I just feel like what an alive, how much more alive than any person, you know?

05:58.865 --> 05:58.965
Yeah.

05:58.945 --> 06:24.801
Um so anyway that's I don't think it is like a magical realism. I think that's that's an arbitrary kind of. It's a category that's useful for reviewers I guess. I guess so but I think it's very narrow and I think it's you know in a way kind of silly. Um this is it's interesting that I remember after elimination night and I came to your house

06:26.097 --> 06:26.978
I was astonished.

06:27.119 --> 06:34.311
I think I sensed it, having read that book, that there were a lot of the qualities, this fear, the phobias.

06:34.851 --> 06:39.319
Are you still afflicted with any of these phobias?

06:39.860 --> 06:49.776
Well, I think writers and people who are phobic are really similar in that their main mode of operation is what if.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.466
You know, for a writer, that's what you're thinking about.

06:52.506 --> 06:53.607
That's the way you operate.

06:53.627 --> 06:57.071
You know, what if this character walked into a room and met this other character?

06:57.171 --> 07:05.500
And, you know, as somebody who has phobias, you know, it's like, what if I walk down the street and a plane crashes right here on the, you know, mass app or whatever?

07:06.020 --> 07:12.147
So I think there's a certain kind of imagination that's pretty similar, really.

07:12.527 --> 07:13.468
So...

07:13.752 --> 07:17.117
But you seem to be getting out a lot more now, or is that?

07:17.137 --> 07:18.519
I think I always have, you know.

07:18.540 --> 07:27.774
I think it's more, you know, people who are critical of themselves tend to be more aware of everything they can't do, you know.

07:28.075 --> 07:33.924
I have to believe, I have two daughters age, one that will be 14 in a couple of weeks.

07:33.944 --> 07:34.144
Oh.

07:34.284 --> 07:36.047
So a little older than yours, I guess.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.533
But I think when you have these kids, it doesn't get easier.

07:40.553 --> 07:41.634
It just gets harder.

07:41.654 --> 07:43.416
It's just this anxiety about everything.

07:43.616 --> 07:43.836
Yeah.

07:44.717 --> 07:47.939
Illness, disease, safety.

07:47.959 --> 07:48.840
Right.

07:48.860 --> 07:48.980
Right.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.881
Those are all the things.

07:49.921 --> 07:53.004
Am I doing the best that I can to make them good people?

07:53.144 --> 07:53.664
Right.

07:54.325 --> 07:54.425
Yeah.

07:54.665 --> 07:56.046
I mean, I could do time as well.

07:56.067 --> 07:56.847
That's completely.

07:56.887 --> 07:57.988
That's exactly it.

07:58.028 --> 08:03.873
I mean, the enjoyment, the satisfaction of having them is one thing.

08:03.893 --> 08:06.996
I mean, it validates your life in so many ways.

08:07.465 --> 08:17.318
But on the other hand, the anxiety that all of a sudden... I mean, I always noticed that people that don't have children for whatever reason look much younger than people that do have children.

08:17.339 --> 08:18.600
Well, they get younger, too.

08:18.620 --> 08:19.602
Yeah.

08:19.642 --> 08:20.903
They sleep through the night, you know?

08:20.923 --> 08:21.825
That's what you said earlier.

08:21.845 --> 08:23.707
It changed your whole perspective, didn't it?

08:23.727 --> 08:26.231
You really did become actually an adult.

08:26.551 --> 08:27.452
Right.

08:27.472 --> 08:28.654
I miss motherhood.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.857
I mean, the fact is, a mother...

08:31.293 --> 08:34.938
I would hope a father would feel the same way, but of course it's not always the case.

08:34.958 --> 08:43.869
A mother does without qualifications and feels so totally for the welfare of the kid.

08:44.430 --> 08:49.917
And it does bring you outside of yourself into another, I guess.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.479
I think it does.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.263
I think being a parent, I think that's being a parent.

08:54.530 --> 09:00.398
I think it's always waiting for the person to come home, always thinking about what can happen.

09:00.478 --> 09:02.661
And it's just different than just having yourself to think about.

09:02.801 --> 09:03.442
It's different.

09:03.803 --> 09:04.203
It's funny.

09:04.223 --> 09:10.792
When people ask me if they can borrow my books, you know, I don't want them out.

09:11.333 --> 09:16.840
And I compare it with waiting for my daughter to come home for her estate, you know.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.022
Will the book be returned?

09:18.583 --> 09:21.607
And I would much rather buy somebody a copy of the book.

09:21.787 --> 09:21.887
Yeah.

09:22.053 --> 09:24.035
It's funny, yeah, I don't blame you.

09:24.176 --> 09:34.989
It's funny because I think, you know, you have two daughters, and I think in some ways the thing, you know, as a woman, your concerns are different, you know, in terms of boys and girls.

09:35.410 --> 09:41.257
But I think that's part of the reason, you know, that for this book I wanted to see what it was like to have, you know, two daughters.

09:41.537 --> 09:45.562
You know, I wanted to experience, like, the familialness of it and the worries.

09:46.303 --> 09:47.585
Did you think it was different?

09:47.605 --> 09:50.929
I had it as a question why the two girls, but...

09:51.145 --> 09:54.370
I wouldn't have expected that answer.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.151
That's interesting.

09:56.132 --> 09:57.394
It's also generational.

09:57.975 --> 10:05.846
Can you tell me about why it had to be generational?

10:05.866 --> 10:18.203
Well, I think, you know, no matter how you try to escape from your own kind of past, it always, I think it does kind of, I mean, it's possible to refine things and to change things, but I think, you know, your past is with you.

10:18.223 --> 10:18.604
Yeah.

10:19.006 --> 10:21.129
And that's a little bit about what it is.

10:21.149 --> 10:21.970
Baggage, I guess.

10:23.632 --> 10:31.442
I love the way you start every... Where do you get all these little magic, not magic things, but these superstitious things?

10:31.462 --> 10:33.865
Well, a lot of them are kind of, what do you call it?

10:34.165 --> 10:35.086
Some are made up.

10:35.106 --> 10:39.011
Some are kind of old, what they used to call old wives tales.

10:39.031 --> 10:40.473
Some are like traditional.

10:40.814 --> 10:46.461
There's something where it says something, you know, women should wear blue, and that's where that, you know, when you wear something, borrow something blue.

10:46.481 --> 10:48.203
I mean, they're kind of traditional

10:48.503 --> 11:13.026
um kind of charms you know that people have done for ages and some of them, most of them are that sort of thing. What's good luck what's bad luck. You obviously never had any trouble this is what the 11th book? Yeah. 20 years, how many years is it? Yeah I think it is 20 years. I don't like this. Yeah more than 20 years

11:13.327 --> 11:15.852
I think my first book was published when I was 22.

11:15.872 --> 11:17.234
That's something.

11:17.314 --> 11:19.238
Congratulations.

11:19.258 --> 11:21.643
So it's a gift, isn't it?

11:21.663 --> 11:22.164
It must be.

11:22.685 --> 11:25.770
I think it's more of an obsession than a gift.

11:25.790 --> 11:26.552
Do you know what I mean?

11:26.572 --> 11:35.669
I feel like when people write, it's more that you can't stop writing, not that you can't think of what you write about.

11:35.689 --> 11:36.330
But in terms of...

11:37.137 --> 11:42.143
I feel like I'm blocked every time I start.

11:42.183 --> 11:45.988
I kind of forget how it is to start a book, and then it just kind of happens.

11:47.049 --> 11:49.692
Do you have an idea for a book when you start?

11:50.012 --> 12:03.048
Yeah, I do, but sometimes I have the experience of looking from a sign cabinet and finding part of a book that I have no memory of writing, but I guess it didn't work out, or something.

12:03.208 --> 12:07.093
That's happened to me several times, and I just don't remember writing it at all.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.290
All your books are novels.

12:08.430 --> 12:11.054
I mean, you haven't done stories.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.517
I've done some stories.

12:13.537 --> 12:20.067
You haven't published a volume of stories.

12:20.087 --> 12:20.187
No.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.909
So it's the novelist mentality.

12:21.970 --> 12:24.894
I guess you're more of a marathon runner.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.877
Yeah, I guess.

12:26.897 --> 12:28.739
I'm gloping if you have to think of me.

12:28.759 --> 12:29.481
No, that's true.

12:29.501 --> 12:29.841
That's true.

12:30.277 --> 12:37.266
Do you think in terms of narrative, I mean, constantly thinking about stories when we hear fragments of conversations?

12:37.286 --> 12:40.811
Well, I tend not to use real life.

12:41.252 --> 12:43.575
So I think consciously.

12:43.595 --> 12:56.352
So I think I'm not thinking about stories as they're just kind of, I'm probably unconsciously collecting things as they become stories, mostly when I sit down to work.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.571
I don't think of it a bit beforehand.

12:58.792 --> 13:10.130
I mean, if this were a Saturday and I came in as a male adult, with a teenage daughter, would you start thinking, well, I wonder if he's divorced.

13:10.150 --> 13:10.451
No.

13:11.032 --> 13:13.877
That's great, huh?

13:13.897 --> 13:14.157
Thanks.

13:14.217 --> 13:18.424
First of all, I'm in the room.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.236
Thank you.

13:20.256 --> 13:22.498
Can I crush pepper?

13:22.518 --> 13:23.480
I wouldn't, thank you.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.220
I wouldn't.

13:24.601 --> 13:30.688
Well, we're being good, aren't we?

13:32.530 --> 13:32.730
All right.

13:32.750 --> 13:33.071
Nice.

13:33.111 --> 13:33.611
Thanks.

13:34.552 --> 13:37.316
Again, that's some dessert.

13:37.616 --> 13:38.116
Yeah.

13:38.197 --> 13:42.882
I don't work out of reality in that way, consciously.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.525
I mean, I think things surface, but...

13:47.311 --> 13:50.895
So everything is not a natural story for you.

13:50.915 --> 13:53.779
So coming up with stories is work, I guess.

13:54.039 --> 13:56.522
Well, they just kind of come.

13:56.542 --> 13:57.984
But I have to do it when I'm writing.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.450
The process of writing is the thing that brings it out.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.033
Do you start with the characters, the story?

14:06.114 --> 14:07.396
Different every time.

14:07.856 --> 14:09.038
It's really different every time.

14:09.058 --> 14:09.799
Is it magical?

14:09.859 --> 14:11.501
It's really magical.

14:11.521 --> 14:12.181
Do you sit down?

14:12.442 --> 14:12.942
Yeah, it is.

14:13.022 --> 14:16.727
I mean, I think that, you know,

14:17.112 --> 14:28.127
I think, you know, my life's reality affects it, but it's like, for instance, I was writing a book called Turtle Moon, and I was then, like, halfway done, and a friend of mine died, so I stopped.

14:28.308 --> 14:30.170
He was killed in my car.

14:30.330 --> 14:39.924
So I stopped for about three months and did things related to his death and whatever, and then I went back to writing, and there was an angel who appeared in my book.

14:39.944 --> 14:40.825
It was somebody who's been

14:41.581 --> 14:42.803
It killed him and crashed him.

14:42.823 --> 14:48.432
And I didn't think at the time, oh, this was directly related to my friend having died or, you know.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.637
But afterwards, of course, it came clear to me that this was not the character.

14:51.717 --> 14:55.943
It wasn't the same person, but it came, you know, from that.

14:56.023 --> 14:57.926
So I think it's, that's, I'm all worried.

14:57.986 --> 14:59.669
Who knows what the wellsprings are.

14:59.689 --> 15:00.691
Right, exactly.

15:00.751 --> 15:01.912
Yeah.

15:02.173 --> 15:02.273
Yeah.

15:02.253 --> 15:04.276
Why don't you have some?

15:04.296 --> 15:07.721
And I'll just check this out for you to respond to that.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.221
Okay.

15:08.241 --> 15:08.462
Yeah.

15:08.982 --> 15:14.370
Well, it's not that I don't have a high degree, but they're mainly contemporary, you know, kind of male novels.

15:14.390 --> 15:18.295
I just don't think they're very interesting at the moment.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.641
And it's funny because I went to lunch with a friend, a man who's a writer.

15:22.823 --> 15:25.486
and he was talking about all these books he's read recently.

15:25.506 --> 15:29.650
They've left me all that many, and I've never heard of any of the men, and I've never heard of any of the books.

15:29.730 --> 15:37.198
I just, you know, there's some male writers who I really like and feel, you know, I like Russell Banks a lot.

15:37.398 --> 15:38.599
I like John Irving.

15:38.799 --> 15:49.050
You know, there are certain writers that I respect, but when I'm reading for my own personal pleasure, and I'm reading a lot of novels, I tend to read women.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.140
Do you read for pleasure?

15:50.200 --> 15:50.741
Do you have time?

15:50.781 --> 15:51.361
Yeah.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.884
And you read your contemporaries, too.

15:53.944 --> 15:54.144
I do.

15:54.424 --> 15:55.505
That's unusual.

15:55.605 --> 15:55.826
Is it?

15:55.846 --> 16:01.592
Yeah, I find a lot of people... Do you find that you're approaching it like a carpenter?

16:01.612 --> 16:05.976
I mean, are you looking at the sense of craft and what they're doing, or are you reading it as a reader?

16:05.996 --> 16:07.818
I'm just reading it as a reader.

16:07.878 --> 16:11.522
Good for you, because you're able to do that.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.824
Well, I don't think of myself as an academic or an intellectual.

16:13.844 --> 16:15.746
But you're a professional writer, so you are.

16:15.866 --> 16:15.966
Yeah.

16:16.115 --> 16:27.172
But also, you know, some of the people that I like are the people who are most different than myself, you know, as writers, you know, like I love Jane Smiley.

16:27.192 --> 16:28.133
Oh, did you read the new book?

16:28.594 --> 16:29.055
The new book?

16:29.415 --> 16:31.298
I started, I haven't finished it.

16:31.679 --> 16:33.501
I did an interview with her.

16:33.521 --> 16:36.245
It's astonishing how she can go from that thousand acres.

16:36.826 --> 16:38.990
And the piece I wrote, it's very interesting.

16:39.010 --> 16:40.111
Again, it's a Shakespearean thing.

16:41.273 --> 16:43.176
And then Greenlanders, you know, came prior to that.

16:43.196 --> 16:43.877
Yeah, I love that.

16:44.296 --> 16:51.807
And I said, you know, it is interesting that you, which it was an epic, but it was a play, a historical novel, basically.

16:51.827 --> 16:54.611
So you went from history to tragedy to comedy, which is Shakespeare.

16:55.412 --> 16:56.954
And she found that.

16:56.975 --> 16:57.896
That is interesting.

16:58.116 --> 17:06.408
And she said that a thousand acres and moo were basically conceived as, she conceived them both at the same time.

17:06.428 --> 17:08.011
And I think that they're both there.

17:08.031 --> 17:10.354
They're both Midwestern and they're agricultural.

17:10.621 --> 17:14.066
I mean, I have to say, humor doesn't appeal to me.

17:14.086 --> 17:14.947
Do you know what I mean?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.829
Like, and black humor doesn't.

17:16.849 --> 17:23.278
So even though I admire what she's doing, and I think she's always kind of stretching, I loved The Bad and Anchor.

17:23.298 --> 17:24.860
I totally loved it.

17:25.360 --> 17:30.107
But you certainly have a sense of humor that promotes your work.

17:30.327 --> 17:31.228
You certainly do.

17:31.698 --> 17:43.894
I've been reading a lot of Ellen Gilchrist lately.

17:45.075 --> 17:45.836
Do you know her?

17:45.917 --> 17:48.580
I have not read her work.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.664
Oh, I don't think you'd like her.

17:52.387 --> 17:55.731
Basically, with me, I have to read.

17:56.331 --> 17:56.832
For work.

17:56.852 --> 17:59.174
You know, to introduce things.

17:59.255 --> 17:59.415
Exactly.

18:00.516 --> 18:02.158
Going to New York for Pat Conroy.

18:02.338 --> 18:03.419
Oh, that should be interesting.

18:03.459 --> 18:04.000
That'll be fun.

18:04.020 --> 18:07.243
This will be about the fourth time I've met Pat.

18:07.263 --> 18:09.085
Did you see the big article in Vanity Carr?

18:09.105 --> 18:09.446
I haven't.

18:09.466 --> 18:10.907
I haven't even had a chance to read yet.

18:11.027 --> 18:14.131
I got this Mary Carr's book, which is supposed to be wonderful.

18:14.171 --> 18:15.112
The Liar's Club.

18:15.132 --> 18:17.755
Have you heard it?

18:17.775 --> 18:17.955
It's a...

18:18.104 --> 18:21.267
It's a memoir, which the Times gave it.

18:21.387 --> 18:24.490
I mean, I've rarely seen a rave of a book.

18:25.271 --> 18:25.812
Really?

18:25.832 --> 18:26.712
It's a memoir?

18:26.732 --> 18:27.433
It's a memoir.

18:27.653 --> 18:28.454
West Texas.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.116
It's called Liar's Club.

18:30.316 --> 18:32.398
The Liar's Club.

18:32.558 --> 18:33.819
I'll know more about it, you know.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.483
I'll read it this weekend.

18:37.503 --> 18:38.985
And then Richard Ford next Friday.

18:39.005 --> 18:41.467
So that's, you know, a pretty good lineup.

18:41.507 --> 18:46.592
Yeah, look at that.

18:47.618 --> 18:51.123
I write it very interesting that you don't really like to read from your work.

18:51.824 --> 18:52.866
Yeah, no, I don't.

18:52.886 --> 18:53.507
I wonder why that is.

18:53.927 --> 18:55.730
Well, I started doing it last year.

18:55.750 --> 18:59.135
And I tell you the truth, I don't like to go to readings either.

18:59.235 --> 19:01.519
I don't understand the full phenomenon.

19:01.539 --> 19:04.743
You know, when I started out, people didn't do this the way that they're doing it now.

19:05.525 --> 19:07.888
And I have always hated to be read to.

19:08.577 --> 19:11.521
I think that reading is a really personal experience, you and the book.

19:12.363 --> 19:14.406
And as a child, I hated to be read to.

19:14.466 --> 19:15.928
I mean, my kids like to be read to.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.011
I understand a lot of people must like to be read to.

19:18.632 --> 19:20.415
But I can't stand it.

19:20.435 --> 19:22.558
And so, I mean, you know, I'll do readings.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.000
I'm going to do one of my kids read.

19:24.021 --> 19:24.922
And it's okay.

19:24.962 --> 19:28.948
But I kind of don't understand the whole thing.

19:29.249 --> 19:30.931
Is it something philosophical?

19:31.332 --> 19:34.255
Well, I think when you read, it becomes a performance piece.

19:34.275 --> 19:36.238
It becomes like a theater thing.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.819
Because that's what they've done with poetry now.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.202
The poets have all of a sudden had a renaissance.

19:40.222 --> 19:40.903
Right, right.

19:40.923 --> 19:43.406
Well, somehow poetry seems more natural.

19:43.426 --> 19:47.832
With poetry, it seems... Thanks.

19:47.852 --> 19:56.282
It seems that that's the whole thing about reading a book or reading a novel is such a personal experience, and it's you, your imagination, and the book.

19:56.803 --> 19:58.665
And if you have somebody reading it and, like,

19:59.017 --> 20:06.208
reading the dialogue with certain inflection and, you know, you're not getting a pure version of what it should be.

20:06.449 --> 20:06.889
I don't know.

20:06.909 --> 20:09.553
Are you ever tempted to revise as you read?

20:09.794 --> 20:13.179
I mean, is the finished work for you a finished work?

20:14.281 --> 20:15.382
I think it is finished, yeah.

20:15.403 --> 20:19.589
I've known so many poets or writers.

20:19.629 --> 20:23.014
John Barth, for instance, looks like he's reading from something else.

20:23.034 --> 20:24.116
He'll change it on the spot.

20:24.136 --> 20:25.378
He'll see something.

20:26.168 --> 20:27.730
Well, maybe that's it.

20:27.750 --> 20:31.155
Maybe I don't want to have to experience that and think, oh, God, I should have done this.

20:31.175 --> 20:32.117
I should have written it this way.

20:32.137 --> 20:32.818
I should have done this.

20:32.918 --> 20:33.379
The book's over.

20:33.719 --> 20:34.941
Do you like reading your books?

20:34.981 --> 20:36.143
Do you read your books?

20:36.163 --> 20:37.605
No, I don't.

20:37.625 --> 20:38.366
Done.

20:38.386 --> 20:40.750
Next case, right?

20:40.770 --> 20:44.054
Do you see your 11 books as a body of work?

20:44.074 --> 20:44.916
Is it a corpus?

20:46.398 --> 20:50.003
Do you think the shelf is complete?

20:50.023 --> 20:51.125
It'll be done.

20:51.245 --> 20:52.547
Well, I mean, will there be a...

20:53.557 --> 20:55.740
a unique to it.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.043
You don't look at it that way.

20:58.243 --> 21:01.707
I don't look at it that way, although I do believe that that's true for every writer's work.

21:01.727 --> 21:12.421
I mean, I think when you take a writer's work and you look at it all, you see, you know, the obsessions, the themes, you know, you see, you know, you see work as, you know, complete work.

21:13.081 --> 21:16.205
Are you mindfully minding your obsessions?

21:16.285 --> 21:18.608
No, I'm not mindfully doing anything.

21:18.628 --> 21:20.411
That's a good quote, by the way.

21:21.091 --> 21:22.433
I take the terms of quotes for the

21:22.801 --> 21:31.311
How do these interviews at the bookstores with the readers, with the non-professional interviews work out?

21:31.371 --> 21:32.352
Do they ask good questions?

21:32.372 --> 21:34.114
Well, you know, I've never done it before last year.

21:34.134 --> 21:46.308
Last year was the first time I'd ever done anything, and it was a pleasant surprise because my readers just seemed like, I felt like, I felt that they were the people I'd choose to spend time with.

21:46.328 --> 21:47.169
Do you know what I mean?

21:47.229 --> 21:48.070
They seemed so familiar to me.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.652
They seemed like, oh...

21:49.717 --> 21:52.405
These are, you know, my contemporaries.

21:52.425 --> 21:54.130
They seem very familiar to me.

21:54.150 --> 21:58.141
It was really a nice experience to do that.

21:58.201 --> 22:03.456
I was really surprised because I feel like I'm usually so isolated, I don't think, in terms of having readers.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.192
You don't really?

22:05.252 --> 22:05.412
No.

22:06.113 --> 22:06.894
Do you get letters?

22:06.914 --> 22:10.618
You don't have a... I get letters, but I only last year's heard an answer on them.

22:10.638 --> 22:14.342
I usually, you know, I just didn't respond because it just seemed, I didn't have time.

22:14.362 --> 22:17.526
You know, it just seemed too, it diffuses things, you know.

22:17.886 --> 22:19.608
You might just get a dialogue.

22:19.788 --> 22:20.749
Dialogue is going with you.

22:20.990 --> 22:22.511
I don't have time, you know.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.473
I barely have time to comb my hair, you know.

22:24.493 --> 22:29.860
I did a piece I did this week.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.881
Was it Mary Wesley?

22:30.901 --> 22:32.483
Have you heard of her?

22:32.503 --> 22:32.563
No.

22:32.583 --> 22:32.903
82-year-old.

22:33.659 --> 22:34.840
Wonderful.

22:36.302 --> 22:38.945
Finally, she's a phenomenon in England.

22:38.965 --> 22:42.389
I'd never heard of her read it, but she's done 11 books, nine books in 11 years.

22:42.409 --> 22:45.352
She started publishing at the age of 70.

22:46.313 --> 22:46.854
Really?

22:46.934 --> 22:51.419
And they compare her with whoever they are.

22:51.439 --> 22:54.122
It was a big piece in her.

22:54.142 --> 22:56.304
It was a form of barrenness.

22:56.324 --> 22:59.368
Oh, that's interesting.

22:59.388 --> 23:01.270
But who said that this...

23:01.604 --> 23:21.076
This marriage to this Lord, or whatever he was, realized it was a disaster halfway through the ceremony, left to marry the half-German, this was during, before World War II, and so therefore was disinherited, and when this guy died, she was penniless, and started writing these books, which are wonderful.

23:21.096 --> 23:26.004
I had a good review on the book, a good review on the times, but a very interesting interview.

23:26.045 --> 23:28.168
What am I driving into here?

23:28.351 --> 23:29.232
I don't know.

23:29.353 --> 23:31.797
Eleven books in nine years, that's a lot.

23:31.817 --> 23:32.298
I don't know.

23:32.318 --> 23:33.079
Oh, she gets letters.

23:33.199 --> 23:36.064
She gets letters from her collectors and her readers.

23:36.084 --> 23:40.050
And she has this pen pal creation.

23:40.071 --> 23:40.411
Wow.

23:40.431 --> 23:43.276
I don't know how she does it.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.217
Maybe she doesn't sleep.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.201
Maybe she doesn't sleep.

23:46.221 --> 23:48.064
She also says writing is an obsession.

23:48.084 --> 23:52.992
She used to tell the children, even before she was published, she used to write therapy.

23:53.545 --> 23:55.248
You'd say, mommy has the flu.

23:55.628 --> 23:57.491
She goes, right.

23:59.835 --> 24:01.458
Now, you don't do that, right?

24:01.698 --> 24:03.120
No, I don't.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.931
It's interesting that you had a grandmother who wrote Yiddish, is that right?

24:09.951 --> 24:10.692
A grandfather.

24:10.712 --> 24:12.916
A grandfather.

24:12.936 --> 24:14.759
I have in my book.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.201
Have you ever heard of Aaron Lansky?

24:17.102 --> 24:19.506
He founded the National Yiddish Book Center.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.768
Totally obsessed.

24:21.052 --> 24:27.562
And his goal in life is to save the Yiddish language by gathering as many books as he can.

24:27.582 --> 24:28.964
He's got a million of them.

24:28.984 --> 24:29.144
Wow.

24:29.565 --> 24:31.348
And he got him a carpentry scholarship.

24:31.788 --> 24:34.052
I read about this since I was a boy.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.895
I don't know.

24:35.915 --> 24:41.423
He's basically responsible now for Yiddish being taught in 150 colleges all over the world.

24:41.656 --> 24:42.998
He rescues books.

24:43.519 --> 24:47.925
I love them.

24:47.965 --> 24:49.527
To keep that language alive.

24:49.547 --> 24:51.249
Well, not only to keep it alive, he was dying.

24:52.972 --> 24:55.936
You know, you can't read it, I'll bet.

24:55.956 --> 25:00.902
So if you inherited 25 books in Nittich, what would you do with them?

25:00.923 --> 25:01.844
Yeah.

25:01.864 --> 25:03.386
He would go and get them.

25:03.406 --> 25:04.668
Yeah, that's really great.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.914
It's a cute story.

25:08.934 --> 25:09.835
One of my chapters.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.477
That's good.

25:11.812 --> 25:26.351
I've read something about your feelings for fiction as fiction is really the expression of truth.

25:26.411 --> 25:29.816
I think so.

25:29.836 --> 25:33.280
I think it's very awesome, you know.

25:33.530 --> 25:38.394
that non-fiction is giving you the fact that it's not giving you the truth sometimes.

25:38.595 --> 25:46.502
No, but it seems like, you know, fiction, when it's at its best, it gives you a deeper kind of truth, the deepest kind of truth.

25:46.522 --> 25:51.326
That's the same.

25:53.668 --> 26:00.835
By the way, the novel is for me the most difficult... It is difficult because you don't have a subject, you know?

26:00.915 --> 26:03.537
Well, and it's my job to read the book.

26:04.107 --> 26:10.398
It would offend me if I were a novelist to have somebody ask me what I was writing about.

26:10.418 --> 26:11.801
That's my job.

26:11.821 --> 26:12.542
I should be able to do that.

26:12.562 --> 26:15.868
So I'm really not looking for some other stuff.

26:15.928 --> 26:16.248
Yeah.

26:16.669 --> 26:18.092
I think we have some stuff, right?

26:18.112 --> 26:19.173
Have we done okay?

26:19.414 --> 26:20.155
I think so.

26:20.175 --> 26:22.740
I think so.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.204
Are you writing fantasies in your mind when you do?

26:25.927 --> 26:32.158
Well, I don't know what the definition is.

26:32.739 --> 26:36.466
I think writing fiction is writing a fantasy.

26:37.368 --> 26:40.313
You can call it realistic fiction or whatever, but it's still a fantasy.

26:42.116 --> 26:44.400
I don't know how I feel about those kinds of definitions.

26:44.420 --> 26:47.125
I'm not really sure how they apply.

26:47.493 --> 27:05.861
Working on something?

27:07.423 --> 27:09.807
Do you believe in spells?

27:09.927 --> 27:12.150
I like the section superstition.

27:12.873 --> 27:14.716
premonition, limitation.

27:14.736 --> 27:15.056
Yeah.

27:15.878 --> 27:26.734
Well, I believe that if you, you know, I believe that there's the, you know, in the power of people to think themselves into, you know, whatever they choose to believe in.

27:26.754 --> 27:27.916
You know, I mean, I believe in that.

27:27.936 --> 27:36.008
I believe in, you know, if you feel that someone could have gone, you know, you could easily become, you know, affected by it.

27:36.109 --> 27:37.371
I don't know what I believe in.

27:37.511 --> 27:39.754
You know, I don't, I'm not sure what I believe in.

27:39.774 --> 27:40.956
I mean, I'm willing to

27:41.341 --> 27:49.419
You must be blessed.

27:49.860 --> 28:00.885
I hate to use that word, but as a literary writer you are respected.

28:01.321 --> 28:19.174
I feel like when I start publishing, publishing is really different in that it's constricted and that it's really changed and that it's much different for people who have started publishing for 20 years.

28:19.194 --> 28:20.777
This is my family.

28:20.797 --> 28:21.979
I'm going to leave one there alone.

28:22.280 --> 28:26.508
Describe my book before you leave.

28:26.528 --> 28:27.410
They might not be leaving.

28:27.450 --> 28:28.592
Yeah, I'd like to.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.656
I think it really has changed.

28:30.676 --> 28:32.359
I mean, people I know are young writers now.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.306
I think it's much you're either... You're either...

28:36.860 --> 28:40.586
Commercially, you're literized.

28:40.606 --> 28:41.848
But it's Nick, right?

28:42.029 --> 28:44.753
I mean, don't you think of yourself as Nick?

28:44.833 --> 28:48.219
Could you date it, please?

28:48.239 --> 28:49.662
Yep.

28:49.682 --> 28:51.244
Today's my 20th anniversary date.

28:51.465 --> 28:52.146
Ooh.

28:52.847 --> 28:54.710
And that's something.

28:54.730 --> 28:55.011
Good.

28:55.311 --> 28:58.817
And she's in the life's other vineyard.

28:59.860 --> 29:00.901
Are you going out there?

29:01.422 --> 29:02.643
Well, yeah.

29:02.883 --> 29:06.467
This is the place to do it, on the title page, is that right?

29:06.487 --> 29:12.353
That's just some book dealer telling me that's the only place where, if you ever wanted to be worth anything, if it's any place else, it's not.

29:12.373 --> 29:13.114
Is that right?

29:13.694 --> 29:18.299
I'm having these wonderful... When Darcy listens to books, have her sign it on there.

29:18.319 --> 29:19.100
She does.

29:19.160 --> 29:25.767
My collection, by the way, is...
