WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:06.768
Test, test, test, test, test.

00:06.788 --> 00:08.891
Just don't even think it's here.

00:08.911 --> 00:13.095
Just there.

00:13.115 --> 00:25.829
Why don't you start now?

00:25.849 --> 00:25.950
Okay.

00:25.970 --> 00:27.071
This is part of the river collection here in this room.

00:27.091 --> 00:28.072
I do have a few other books scattered throughout.

00:28.092 --> 00:29.093
My goal is to collect every edition of everything.

00:29.292 --> 00:52.313
So these, pardon me, but what I'm looking at here in our subsequent editions, they're not... Well, there are a couple of these, but most of them are...

00:54.841 --> 01:03.774
For instance, I think it's this one, at random, Powder River, Shethersburg.

01:05.636 --> 01:06.918
This was the first part.

01:06.938 --> 01:08.560
Powder River, the W-D-E-R.

01:09.762 --> 01:14.408
Letterbuck by Struthers, S-C-R-U-T-O-G-R, S-B-E-R-T.

01:14.428 --> 01:17.993
There's a very well-known Western writer.

01:18.013 --> 01:19.816
This was published in 1938.

01:20.016 --> 01:21.979
It was, I believe, the

01:22.448 --> 01:25.151
or the fourth book in the series.

01:25.512 --> 01:26.733
It's beautiful condition.

01:26.813 --> 01:28.775
I see condition is exceedingly important to you.

01:29.016 --> 01:34.021
I try to collect books in very good or better condition.

01:34.101 --> 01:40.749
Occasionally with the reprints, in order to document the books, I have to take whatever I can get.

01:41.490 --> 01:51.882
As the print ones, as the books were printed, some of the print ones were very small.

01:52.503 --> 02:13.119
Could you give me a little background, explain what the series is?

02:13.139 --> 02:13.800
The series consists of 65 titles.

02:13.820 --> 02:16.485
It was a series of plans, started by Clemston, who was a

02:17.022 --> 02:20.327
There she is.

02:20.547 --> 02:35.407
Constance is incredible.

02:35.427 --> 02:42.016
It's a little biography of her that was prepared by the Women's National Book Association.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.920
In 1980, they have a little fire of her personal recollections by friends of Skinner, and they do give the Constance of Skinner Award.

03:15.106 --> 03:18.329
I think I'll be able to get the background on her.

03:18.369 --> 03:22.674
What prompted her fascination for Rivers, I wonder.

03:22.694 --> 03:31.503
I wanted to get to her a copy of the... That's great.

03:32.464 --> 03:37.088
And this is Jane talking.

03:37.369 --> 03:44.556
What I want to say about Nancy Skinner is that she wrote a wonderful essay which outlined her intentions.

03:45.262 --> 03:47.885
intentions with the Rivers of America series.

03:48.406 --> 04:00.742
It's very, very cleverly thought through that America developed along its rivers and that for a long time the rivers were the major means of transportation, getting from one place to the other.

04:01.543 --> 04:04.687
You have only to think about Lewis and Clark, for example.

04:05.388 --> 04:10.735
But there were no highways, there were no railroads, there were no airlines, there were no bus routes.

04:11.596 --> 04:14.500
You either went by wagon and took six months to get from St.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.201
Louis to Maine

04:15.755 --> 04:19.020
in Salt Lake City, or you use the rivers.

04:19.521 --> 04:34.485
And she said that the story of our country, and she was a Canadian, I've heard, should be told through its rivers, and it should be told by poets and writers, not just historians.

04:34.545 --> 04:37.189
This is so important to this new book that I'm working on.

04:38.571 --> 04:41.796
She said incredible, incredible vision, really.

04:42.248 --> 04:42.890
She wrote this?

04:42.950 --> 04:43.732
This is written?

04:44.695 --> 04:45.196
Yes.

04:45.216 --> 04:46.299
Is this something I can take?

04:46.319 --> 04:47.863
I can make a copy.

04:48.344 --> 04:49.367
Oh, good.

04:49.387 --> 04:49.828
We have a copy.

04:49.849 --> 04:51.553
Excuse me.

04:51.653 --> 04:52.436
How do you take a copy?

04:52.456 --> 04:52.897
Just black.

04:53.498 --> 04:53.879
All right.

04:54.060 --> 04:54.281
Carol?

04:55.765 --> 04:57.068
Green?

04:57.622 --> 05:06.873
This was the essay that set forth the series, The River of America.

05:06.893 --> 05:09.916
This was taken from the New York Public Library.

05:09.956 --> 05:12.900
They have a 1937 question mark.

05:12.920 --> 05:23.292
My research has determined now, after finding her papers at the New York Public Library, that this was probably written in 1935.

05:23.592 --> 05:27.877
She talks about giving the brochure for prospective writers.

05:28.879 --> 05:33.725
And this was her first essay.

05:34.446 --> 05:41.655
Rivers at American Folk, O-L-K, by Constance Lindsay, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y, Skinner.

05:41.675 --> 05:48.604
And it starts off, when Americans told her troubles that do not end quickly, such as the depression now passing off,

05:49.141 --> 05:54.827
They begin presently to examine their own sources of the nation and their own story of the people.

05:56.068 --> 05:58.210
They forget about these in good times.

05:58.230 --> 05:59.111
And she goes on.

05:59.872 --> 06:05.597
And she talks about, this is to be a literary and not an historical series.

06:05.718 --> 06:08.360
The authors of these books will be novelists and poets.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.541
That's wonderful.

06:09.561 --> 06:16.629
On them, now in America, as in all lands and times, rests the real responsibility of interpretation.

06:17.049 --> 06:19.131
She didn't want, in fact,

06:19.837 --> 06:31.709
If you are able to attend the symposium, Dr. Thomas B. Clark, who wrote the Kentucky, and he's a noted Kentucky historian, he's in his 90s now.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.051
He wanted to write.

06:33.311 --> 06:36.975
He wanted to write a book on the Kentucky.

06:36.995 --> 06:43.602
She turned him down because she didn't want historians to write that book.

06:43.622 --> 06:49.388
After she died unexpectedly in 1939, after only two years of

06:49.655 --> 06:51.939
Oh really?

06:52.019 --> 06:53.803
So she really didn't see it?

06:53.823 --> 06:59.433
She saw five titles published and she died while editing the gallery of the Hudson.

07:00.616 --> 07:02.319
Significant been her first choice.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.008
The choice for the writer of the first book was a poet, more than anything else.

07:07.028 --> 07:07.769
And the poet was?

07:09.072 --> 07:12.017
Robert T. Tristram Coffin.

07:12.689 --> 07:14.975
Could we spell it?

07:15.056 --> 07:19.228
It's Robert P. Tristram.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.918
Okay.

07:23.152 --> 07:29.400
And what was the river that he did?

07:29.801 --> 07:31.744
Oh, the upper name?

07:31.904 --> 07:32.124
Yeah.

07:32.144 --> 07:34.447
And this was the first book in the series.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.531
His reputation really was the Bentecost and the Dramatons.

07:37.571 --> 07:38.913
They're a famous Maine family.

07:38.953 --> 07:40.215
I went to Bates up in Maine.

07:40.435 --> 07:41.316
You did.

07:41.336 --> 07:41.897
I went to Germany.

07:42.258 --> 07:42.698
They did?

07:42.939 --> 07:43.399
Yeah.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.963
I didn't graduate from Germany, but I was a big old.

07:45.983 --> 07:49.928
So we were kind of cousins.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.872
They did, and they still do.

07:52.852 --> 07:53.874
Okay, great.

07:53.994 --> 07:54.936
This was the first.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.142
And this is inscribed?

07:58.323 --> 08:00.287
Yeah.

08:00.307 --> 08:01.028
It's Kennebec.

08:01.329 --> 08:03.192
He may have taught us things sometimes.

08:03.212 --> 08:04.034
He taught us those.

08:04.054 --> 08:06.920
Oh, it's, Coffin is a famous, famous main name.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.288
Frank Coffin was a federal judge.

08:11.488 --> 08:13.813
The first book, they do lay out.

08:14.013 --> 08:19.479
So they even had a little R of a... This is a series device that Farr and Reinhardt used.

08:19.599 --> 08:38.920
Farr and Reinhardt published his book until 1945, and beginning in January of 1946, Reinhardt and company was formed, and they devised their own series device, which was a stylized oval with a little steamship in the center.

08:39.841 --> 08:40.662
But this was...

08:42.937 --> 08:50.189
I think Spires, and I forget who... Yeah, we have the name of the firm that just designed the logo.

08:50.650 --> 08:51.251
Here's your copy.

08:51.311 --> 08:55.759
Great, thank you, sir.

08:55.839 --> 08:59.345
This may have a little more body than you like.

08:59.405 --> 09:00.867
No, no, I like it.

09:00.887 --> 09:06.717
Actually, it's wonderful.

09:09.683 --> 09:09.983
Good.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.748
I require caffeine, actually.

09:14.509 --> 09:16.692
I do, too.

09:16.952 --> 09:18.073
Well, this is what started it.

09:18.634 --> 09:21.077
Why don't you... I'll join you.

09:21.237 --> 09:22.098
Get comfortable somewhere.

09:22.138 --> 09:23.260
You're looking... Standing up.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.121
Would you rather sit down?

09:24.181 --> 09:28.366
Would you rather have a chair in front of the bookcase?

09:28.406 --> 09:29.607
Sit in a nice, comfortable chair.

09:31.490 --> 09:33.933
Want me to bring your pocket, Carol?

09:35.855 --> 09:37.257
Why don't I sit over here, Carol?

09:38.017 --> 09:38.458
And...

09:39.383 --> 09:48.415
How about if I sit right here?

09:48.435 --> 09:49.416
How's this?

09:49.436 --> 09:50.197
Okay.

09:50.477 --> 09:58.207
The books are fine.

09:58.227 --> 10:04.816
The books can stay right where they are.

10:04.876 --> 10:05.597
Okay.

10:06.958 --> 10:07.399
Okay.

10:07.784 --> 10:10.887
for the past six years, and I have original correspondence.

10:11.047 --> 10:23.000
Many of the people with whom I have corresponded have since died, so I have information that really would have been lost forever had I not... Wow.

10:23.060 --> 10:32.069
Maybe if we could talk just for both of you, 15 or 20 minutes, just to like and get, to just sit someplace close to me.

10:32.089 --> 10:36.053
And I think you keep mentioning things that are...

10:37.552 --> 10:41.117
You talk about the correspondence with the authors, and all these things are fascinating.

10:41.177 --> 10:42.059
So tell me a little bit.

10:42.479 --> 10:43.862
Why don't I start at the beginning?

10:43.902 --> 10:44.222
Really.

10:45.424 --> 10:46.606
I'm going to start right.

10:47.607 --> 10:50.431
And then that will occasion some questions.

10:50.552 --> 10:52.635
All right.

10:52.655 --> 10:53.917
This started back in 1986.

10:54.097 --> 11:00.066
Gene, you may know.

11:00.940 --> 11:08.268
had donated a large collection of federal writer's projects and WPA items to our local library.

11:08.708 --> 11:19.801
In 1984 and 1986, we had a symposium sponsored by the Florida Center for the Books and the Library of Congress here in Fort Lauderdale announcing these donations.

11:20.381 --> 11:30.272
And there were several authors, and Jerry Manjohn, who directed the project, were here in town.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.368
Two or three days.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.091
That was the same weekend of the Miami Book Fair.

11:35.812 --> 11:52.489
So with our good friend, Bill Pail, who was a book dealer in Georgetown and had a great jeans collection, we went to Miami and were going through the booze.

11:52.729 --> 11:55.172
And I picked up a book on the St.

11:55.232 --> 11:56.913
Johns River.

11:56.933 --> 11:57.694
And it was in

11:58.028 --> 12:01.933
pretty good shape, a dust jacket, and my sister lives on the St.

12:01.953 --> 12:06.898
John's in Jacksonville, and I said, this will make a nice Christmas gift for her.

12:06.918 --> 12:07.980
It was November.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.101
From the year, once again?

12:09.121 --> 12:09.541
1986.

12:09.622 --> 12:11.864
I thought you said that, okay.

12:11.884 --> 12:16.329
So, Bill Hale, the book dealer, said that would make a nice collection.

12:18.071 --> 12:24.499
And, of course, Gene had just, we had just gotten rid of, I don't know, seven or eight hundred thousand pieces and books.

12:24.819 --> 12:25.240
How many?

12:26.421 --> 12:26.802
I don't know.

12:26.822 --> 12:27.242
I think it was

12:27.492 --> 12:32.940
We've lost count, but it was close to a thousand.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.985
They were not all books.

12:36.225 --> 12:37.167
But it was mostly books.

12:37.187 --> 12:42.976
The Federal Writers Project went on for a long time, and they produced a lot of things because they were all over.

12:42.996 --> 12:50.027
Stuff that was being read all over the United States, little monographs, little broadsheets, books and the state guides and all that.

12:50.087 --> 12:54.073
There's a fellow in my book, before I forget, Fred

12:54.880 --> 12:57.262
Mr. Bride, I guess is his name.

12:57.563 --> 13:01.647
I will look it up before, but he collects these by the way of his project.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.008
There are several famous collections.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.991
There's a doctor in Philadelphia, as I remember.

13:06.011 --> 13:08.994
There's a collector with an oriental name.

13:09.674 --> 13:17.141
But immodestly, I will tell you, at the time of the donation to our library, my collection was the finest and the largest.

13:17.162 --> 13:22.086
And it really got the library off on a new tack altogether.

13:22.487 --> 13:23.908
Depression era studies and

13:24.597 --> 13:27.340
And John Cole was here for that.

13:27.380 --> 13:27.921
Yeah, I'm here.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.604
That's when we met him.

13:30.665 --> 13:33.588
So you actually had the collecting impulse.

13:33.648 --> 13:37.313
Did it precede your own personal passion?

13:37.513 --> 13:38.735
I think a little.

13:38.755 --> 13:44.742
I think we all have a little desire to collect in us.

13:44.762 --> 13:52.131
We were married the year that I made that donation, and I had been collecting federal artists 20 years before that long term.

13:52.372 --> 13:52.812
Really?

13:53.373 --> 13:53.473
Yeah.

13:54.095 --> 13:55.377
I've had the impulse.

13:55.497 --> 13:57.521
Mine was inspired by a Washington, D.C.

13:57.561 --> 13:59.464
guy, which is still a very good guy for the city.

14:00.485 --> 14:01.427
Did you have all of it?

14:01.447 --> 14:03.030
Did you manage to get the whole?

14:03.210 --> 14:18.094
Well, I had all the state guys and all the city guys, but no one will ever know what all really means in reference to the Federal Writers Project, because they gave their support to maybe a woman.

14:20.808 --> 14:24.893
That's exactly the volunteer art department.

14:24.913 --> 14:26.114
They did a cookbook or something.

14:26.254 --> 14:27.015
Oh, they did a lot of cookbooks.

14:27.035 --> 14:27.656
A lot of cookbooks.

14:27.676 --> 14:42.373
And our library has continued to buy WPA and Federal Writers Project materials, and they have, I understand, doubled what Jane has given us just through the perseverance of working with dealers.

14:43.033 --> 14:48.840
And people know that we will buy, our library will buy these items as some are available.

14:49.495 --> 14:54.002
It is important, why did you decide to carpet it?

14:54.102 --> 14:59.751
Did you feel that it was kind of complete, or was it time to pass it on?

14:59.851 --> 15:10.147
I don't remember ever selling anything as much as I do, as all book collectors do.

15:10.247 --> 15:13.512
I've done a few trades here.

15:14.403 --> 15:17.366
The motivating force, however, was Jean Trevi.

15:17.427 --> 15:25.416
Jean called me one day sort of out of the blue and asked me if I'd have lunch with her.

15:25.836 --> 15:31.903
I was too innocent to realize that she had her eye on my collection, but that's what it was.

15:31.963 --> 15:34.967
She was quite frank about it at the luncheon.

15:35.007 --> 15:39.432
She's a frank lady.

15:42.179 --> 15:43.201
Plus, yes, I had it.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.606
And when I was a kid, I collected keys.

15:46.709 --> 15:52.561
I used to go to, remember now, we're talking about depression era.

15:52.581 --> 15:57.131
I would go into a key shop and say, do you have any keys that I can have?

15:57.211 --> 15:57.893
Have you got any players?

15:57.913 --> 16:00.097
Have you got any old?

16:00.117 --> 16:01.420
Often they'd give me a cigar box.

16:03.543 --> 16:05.366
And 10, 15 pounds of keys.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.307
Here's a question for you.

16:06.327 --> 16:07.208
Do you still have the keys?

16:07.509 --> 16:07.689
No.

16:07.989 --> 16:10.173
And I'll give you a better question.

16:10.193 --> 16:11.094
Where are they?

16:11.114 --> 16:11.635
I have no idea.

16:11.655 --> 16:12.696
How did I come to party?

16:12.796 --> 16:13.537
Blame your mother.

16:13.758 --> 16:14.759
She must have thrown them by.

16:14.779 --> 16:17.263
Well, there might have been... Well, I was born the mother.

16:17.964 --> 16:21.289
Well, I went through a series of... How shall I put it?

16:21.309 --> 16:22.150
I've been married before.

16:23.312 --> 16:31.303
And maybe the keys got... Probably when I joined the Navy, I sort of got rid of a lot of... Here's another question.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.605
I bet you'd like to have them back.

16:33.378 --> 16:44.053
No, I would, because I never got to the logical point of learning locks, how to build a lock.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.277
I know how locks work, but I never went through that.

16:46.557 --> 16:52.145
The next thing you have to collect keys, it's got to be locks, right?

16:52.265 --> 16:53.687
And I never got to that stage.

16:53.908 --> 16:57.092
But again, don't blame Mother Glenn.

16:57.853 --> 17:02.440
When we're dead, I'll give you a Hitler line, which is going to be used in the new book.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.564
Okay, so we have this as background.

17:04.785 --> 17:05.326
That's right.

17:05.346 --> 17:06.327
That's how it began.

17:06.487 --> 17:15.402
I bought the book and sat on the shelf here in the living room for maybe, I didn't give it to my sister for Christmas.

17:15.442 --> 17:16.343
I just really didn't part.

17:16.624 --> 17:18.307
It's a collector for you all the way.

17:18.327 --> 17:18.968
There it is.

17:18.988 --> 17:26.220
And shortly after, maybe in the spring, maybe the next fall.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.361
Now we're into 87?

17:27.381 --> 17:28.984
87.

17:29.268 --> 17:32.151
So this collection has been put together in fewer than 10 years.

17:32.372 --> 17:33.953
That's very important.

17:33.973 --> 17:35.375
We were in San Francisco.

17:35.735 --> 17:36.857
She was at a conference.

17:36.877 --> 17:41.142
I had some time to kill, and I wanted into a rare bookstore.

17:41.162 --> 17:44.225
And I, by the chance, do you have any Rivers of America titles?

17:45.186 --> 17:47.809
And the woman looked at me, and she said, no.

17:47.829 --> 17:51.553
She said, I specialize in children's literature.

17:51.573 --> 17:54.937
I haven't given much thought.

17:54.957 --> 17:57.300
And then all of a sudden, she said, yes, I do have a couple.

17:57.601 --> 18:16.401
She said that I have them cataloged by the illustrator, and she had a copy of, a pristine copy of Brandywine by Henry Stiles Candy, which was illustrated by Andrew Wyatt, and the Arkansas... I knew you were going to say that because that's where they are, down in the Brandywine.

18:16.541 --> 18:25.731
Illustrated by Donald McKay, who was a well-known children's book illustrator back in the 30s.

18:25.751 --> 18:27.473
So I bought the book.

18:28.111 --> 18:31.916
and one was $65, I think one was $25.

18:32.176 --> 18:32.577
Steel.

18:33.318 --> 18:34.860
Anything Wyeth.

18:35.821 --> 18:39.426
And it was his first book to illustrate, ever.

18:39.446 --> 18:48.639
We learned recently, last September at Wyeth in Nashville, Tennessee, that that was his first book of inspiration.

18:48.739 --> 18:51.302
He was 23 years old.

18:51.322 --> 18:52.264
And I love N.C.

18:52.324 --> 18:53.325
Wyeth better than...

18:53.508 --> 18:56.352
Better than Andrew, more than Jamie, I think.

18:56.493 --> 18:58.656
Well, this was Andrew Wyatt.

18:58.836 --> 18:59.838
This was Andrew?

18:59.858 --> 18:59.998
Uh-huh.

19:00.258 --> 19:01.480
He was 23?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.784
Andrew, this would have been in 1940.

19:03.804 --> 19:04.765
I'm sorry, I thought you said that.

19:05.707 --> 19:07.289
Okay, it's still a steal.

19:07.309 --> 19:08.110
Okay, it's still a steal.

19:08.130 --> 19:08.932
And he's still wonderful.

19:09.553 --> 19:11.496
So then I had three.

19:11.636 --> 19:12.617
Now you have three.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.522
And I have three.

19:15.902 --> 19:19.488
And in these books, and this one's too early.

19:19.508 --> 19:21.591
I remember that day in San Francisco.

19:24.811 --> 19:26.773
Do you remember the name of the bookstore?

19:27.213 --> 19:31.237
Yes, the Montsutter Street Bookstall.

19:32.759 --> 19:38.705
Check it out.

19:38.725 --> 19:41.828
So, they've moved their location, but it was the bookstall.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.273
Now, this is the way, this is what I had.

19:47.333 --> 19:54.480
I had this book, Rivers of America Books Already Published Art, and it started in chronological order.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.145
I still had no way of knowing how many titles were in the series.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.368
I didn't know what I was looking for, in other words.

20:01.528 --> 20:10.037
I went to the library, books in print, to see books in series, to see if there was a list of release of America series books.

20:10.057 --> 20:12.079
Well, there was, but it's very confusing.

20:13.160 --> 20:19.707
Some, they list it out of print, and I guess if they're not in print, you might get some bad information.

20:20.207 --> 20:25.733
I've had more bad information from books in libraries than I want to remember.

20:26.337 --> 20:32.487
It had me going in the wrong direction early on my collecting date.

20:32.507 --> 20:35.271
But anyway, I started aggressively collecting the books.

20:35.632 --> 20:43.444
I took the ad out of the New York Times for rare and out-of-print book dealers, and I sent them all a letter.

20:45.247 --> 20:47.570
I got responses.

20:47.591 --> 20:49.914
The books started coming in boxes.

20:49.934 --> 20:51.096
I bought everything.

20:51.346 --> 20:58.097
My goal was to get a first edition in very good or better condition in dust jackets.

20:58.117 --> 21:02.505
And I started putting them on shelves.

21:02.525 --> 21:04.969
The books started pouring in and getting shelves.

21:04.989 --> 21:13.123
And truthfully, I think if you're interested in what Carol does, she's an independent researcher.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.767
She's an unpublished author.

21:16.675 --> 21:20.301
She was an inexperienced writer at the time.

21:20.841 --> 21:22.244
College graduate, true.

21:22.264 --> 21:23.325
Good education, true.

21:24.087 --> 21:25.649
I think a natural-born researcher.

21:25.709 --> 21:28.393
But those books started pouring in, and she began to feel this.

21:29.835 --> 21:31.398
It was kind of an irritation.

21:31.418 --> 21:33.060
How many books are there?

21:33.081 --> 21:33.561
Where are they?

21:33.581 --> 21:34.383
What are the names of them?

21:34.463 --> 21:36.225
Why isn't there any compilation?

21:36.245 --> 21:37.968
Why can't we just get a list?

21:38.629 --> 21:39.190
There it is.

21:39.777 --> 21:41.599
The series started, and it ended.

21:41.619 --> 21:43.481
And these are all the books that are written.

21:43.501 --> 21:44.942
And there was a frustration there.

21:44.962 --> 21:50.488
So this is the collector determining that there's a research tool that's missing.

21:50.568 --> 21:51.449
There was nothing.

21:51.469 --> 21:54.391
There was nothing in the library to guide me.

21:54.892 --> 22:05.122
I started putting the books on a three-by-five card, the name of the book, and the author and the illustrator, and the date it was published, and that's how I began.

22:06.443 --> 22:07.084
I started getting...

22:08.127 --> 22:16.238
some interesting authors, some book dealers, like a copy of the Hudson published by William H. William H. and Company in London.

22:17.940 --> 22:19.101
I said, I don't like that.

22:19.121 --> 22:20.623
That can't be part of the series.

22:20.703 --> 22:21.484
It threw me off.

22:21.645 --> 22:28.233
So it was several years later that I thought, oh my goodness, that was part of the series.

22:28.253 --> 22:35.923
I had since learned that there were four titles published in Great Britain, and there were four armed services editions.

22:36.072 --> 22:41.318
13 of these books came out as special limited signed edition.

22:41.338 --> 22:43.920
So I was trying to put the pieces together.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.744
I knew eventually I learned there were 65 titles.

22:47.764 --> 22:58.916
There is a song book that was published in 1942, the Psalms of the Rivers of America, and two of the titles were reprinted after Skinner's death.

23:00.638 --> 23:03.941
They reprinted the Upper Mississippi by Walter Hall.

23:03.961 --> 23:04.242
Revised it.

23:04.262 --> 23:05.623
Revised and reprinted it.

23:06.194 --> 23:13.821
and the James, two of the books that she probably had ever seen herself.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.603
Do you mention that you're a researcher?

23:15.723 --> 23:18.306
Maybe you can give me a little bit of biographical background.

23:18.686 --> 23:25.192
Okay, well, I'm self-taught, but what I did was... Well, how about school in Mississippi?

23:25.252 --> 23:31.858
Well, I have a degree in political science in Stanford University of Mississippi.

23:31.878 --> 23:32.319
It's running again.

23:33.740 --> 23:34.581
Okay, go ahead.

23:36.029 --> 23:39.034
If it goes again, I'm not going to believe I need new batteries.

23:39.054 --> 23:40.396
I just put new batteries.

23:40.476 --> 23:44.942
I enjoyed research at the university.

23:57.742 --> 24:00.165
Test one, two, test, test, test, test, test.

24:00.285 --> 24:01.067
It's working, Jane.

24:01.187 --> 24:02.268
Great, thanks.

24:04.332 --> 24:04.652
Good.

24:05.830 --> 24:06.491
Is it on?

24:07.732 --> 24:07.832
Yeah.

24:07.852 --> 24:24.846
I think that maybe researching books is a long way from doing research with rats in a laboratory, but I think that my joy of discovery and working with the unknown has been with me for a long time.

24:24.866 --> 24:28.249
I think we become more of what we are and not less as we get older.

24:28.689 --> 24:31.492
I sort of found my niche with this series.

24:32.092 --> 24:35.415
As the books started accumulating on the shelves,

24:36.020 --> 24:44.688
I started to wonder who were these men and these women who wrote and illustrated these books.

24:45.089 --> 24:48.151
Most of the names were unknown to me.

24:49.833 --> 24:55.118
Some of them you might know, but most of them you probably would not.

24:55.718 --> 24:57.240
They were regional writers.

24:57.260 --> 25:01.564
Some of them were household names, like Henry Seidel Panby, who wrote The Brand New Wine.

25:01.584 --> 25:05.908
He wasn't a household name to me because I didn't live in that era.

25:06.091 --> 25:06.832
But he was to me.

25:06.892 --> 25:08.254
But he was to Gene.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.857
I read the Saturday Review probably subscribed for 25 years.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.782
So was Coffin, by the way.

25:14.802 --> 25:15.563
So was Coffin.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.747
Walter Havidhurst was a regional writer.

25:18.808 --> 25:24.495
He spent most of his academic years at the University of Miami in Ohio.

25:25.256 --> 25:30.563
But he was an expert on the Great Lakes.

25:30.583 --> 25:34.207
So Skinner selected these people very carefully.

25:34.268 --> 25:35.389
It wasn't that she...

25:35.791 --> 25:38.815
was just looking for any writer.

25:38.875 --> 25:49.167
She was looking for specific writers who would know their territory well, who were known to the people in, say, California.

25:49.187 --> 25:51.450
Julian Dana wrote The Sacramento.

25:52.571 --> 25:58.338
It was I think the third or fourth book in the series.

25:58.358 --> 26:02.743
He had written Sutter of California, which was a book

26:03.162 --> 26:04.924
S-U-T-T-E-R.

26:04.984 --> 26:06.146
S-U-T-T-E-R.

26:06.166 --> 26:14.817
Published by the Pioneer Press in California, but it was selected as the book for the centennial of the state of California.

26:14.837 --> 26:16.960
He was a known quantity.

26:16.980 --> 26:30.358
He was a very good writer, meticulous researcher, and Gertrude Atherton talks about him in her book, My San Francisco, a Wayward Autobiography, a Wayward Biography.

26:31.459 --> 26:32.140
So she...

26:33.065 --> 26:42.654
had a list of people she felt comfortable working with and selecting to write books in the series.

26:43.074 --> 26:58.468
When I found her papers at the New York Public Library, and Jean and I were there over the Thanksgiving holiday, she had a list of about 15 or 20 people that she was considering.

26:58.488 --> 27:01.671
Anyway, that's digressing a little from

27:02.123 --> 27:04.867
my interest in the authors and the old strips.

27:04.887 --> 27:05.988
I started writing letters.

27:06.449 --> 27:12.698
I went to the library and contemporary authors, contemporary autobiography.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.824
I had my list of 60 people.

27:17.365 --> 27:20.529
Many of them are listed in Yale publications.

27:20.549 --> 27:23.834
And they give a little biography and addresses.

27:24.835 --> 27:27.799
I didn't know if they were living or dead.

27:27.819 --> 27:30.443
It was difficult to tell from their dates of birth.

27:30.828 --> 27:36.435
So I prepared a three-page typewritten letter figuring I had one shot.

27:36.455 --> 27:40.580
Either they were going to throw it away or they were going to respond.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.021
They didn't know me.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.764
I didn't have any history.

27:44.825 --> 27:46.987
I had never written a book before.

27:47.027 --> 27:50.531
I had never done... Did you have it in your mind at this point that you were writing about?

27:50.551 --> 27:51.132
No, not at all.

27:51.152 --> 27:54.816
I was doing it simply for my own personal information.

27:54.836 --> 28:00.463
I was trying to determine if their particular book was issued in a

28:00.697 --> 28:02.339
signed limited edition.

28:03.882 --> 28:07.226
At this point it seems to me you're trying to document your collection.

28:07.246 --> 28:07.667
Right.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.228
Basically.

28:08.248 --> 28:10.211
I was trying to find out more about the book.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.095
It doesn't seem to be a scholarly impulse at this point.

28:13.295 --> 28:14.096
I wouldn't think so.

28:14.116 --> 28:18.583
I think it was a sense of order that she wanted to get things organized, find out.

28:19.043 --> 28:21.066
It started out, how many books are there in the series?

28:21.086 --> 28:22.649
Well, nobody knew.

28:22.669 --> 28:29.218
And then that led to all sorts of ideas about subsequent editions and

28:30.177 --> 28:34.722
printings and commemorative editions and special signs, this and that.

28:34.742 --> 28:46.734
And I have to say, at that time, I didn't see myself so much as a book collector as sort of a specialist on the Federal Writers Project, because I collected anything that they had touched.

28:46.774 --> 28:54.362
I would get a badge from a button from a convention or just some throwaway that they had announcing it.

28:54.832 --> 28:57.134
a book fair, something like that.

28:57.154 --> 29:02.059
I didn't consider myself then really knowledgeable about books per se.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.581
But Carol was relentless.

29:04.021 --> 29:06.984
She wanted to know, what is the Rivers of America?

29:07.024 --> 29:07.505
Where are they?

29:07.525 --> 29:08.125
Who wrote them?

29:08.245 --> 29:13.631
And I wrote in my letter, how did you come to write this book?

29:13.791 --> 29:14.732
Great question.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.954
And were you pleased with the illustrations?

29:16.974 --> 29:19.256
Were you pleased with the final result?

29:19.577 --> 29:22.239
Do you have a blank copy of the letter?

29:22.299 --> 29:23.361
That I sent out?

29:23.381 --> 29:24.822
Yeah, I think I can do that for you.

29:25.139 --> 29:39.958
and this was in may of 1991 i don't know i probably sent six or seven letters so you've had enough for four years the collection essentially started in 80s well you got the first book in 86 the collection

29:40.563 --> 29:41.645
Started growing rapidly.

29:41.665 --> 29:43.828
About 87, started growing rapidly.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.211
By 1991, you're writing letters now.

29:46.592 --> 29:48.655
I'm very, very curious.

29:48.815 --> 29:51.699
I'm at the library every day on my lunch hour.

29:51.719 --> 29:52.761
This library here.

29:52.881 --> 29:55.985
Yes, my office is directly across the street.

29:56.026 --> 29:58.830
I'm an administrative assistant to a county commissioner.

29:59.471 --> 30:09.405
And so every day, for about five years, I went to the library every noon, researching, looking for needles and haystacks.

30:09.892 --> 30:14.137
and sometimes coming up with wonderful, wonderful information.

30:14.157 --> 30:22.588
But when I wrote the letters in May, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to get.

30:22.608 --> 30:26.453
Jane and I decided to go to New Mexico the first week in June.

30:26.913 --> 30:30.037
One of the letters I had written was to Frank Waters.

30:30.057 --> 30:31.119
Are you familiar with the name?

30:31.139 --> 30:31.279
No.

30:31.940 --> 30:39.409
He was a well-known writer, Western writer, Southwest.

30:40.148 --> 30:40.989
lived in Taos.

30:41.510 --> 30:42.672
He has a household name.

30:42.872 --> 30:44.054
W-A-T-E-R-S, right?

30:44.074 --> 30:45.436
Right.

30:45.596 --> 30:49.902
His well-known book, The Man Who Killed the Deer, published in 1942.

30:50.003 --> 30:52.947
Since then, he's written many others.

30:53.007 --> 30:55.070
He wrote the book on the Colorado River.

30:57.113 --> 30:58.736
Didn't know much about Frank Waters.

30:58.976 --> 30:59.757
I simply wrote him.

30:59.777 --> 31:03.062
He got one of my three pagers.

31:03.082 --> 31:05.425
And... How did you find addresses to mail to?

31:05.846 --> 31:07.989
In... Oh, in Gale Research.

31:08.009 --> 31:08.710
In Gale Research.

31:09.331 --> 31:09.852
And...

31:10.102 --> 31:12.727
It's a marvelous, marvelous source.

31:13.088 --> 31:23.428
If you're looking, I'm sure you'll be in there in the next publication, and they would have your address, your agent's address, and your address.

31:23.648 --> 31:28.077
They may quote from a letter that you write in response to an encouragement.

31:28.613 --> 31:30.075
What are you doing now?

31:30.135 --> 31:31.317
What are you working on now?

31:31.457 --> 31:32.218
A work in progress?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.340
And they'll put it in their next publication.

31:34.661 --> 31:36.083
So be careful what you say.

31:36.623 --> 31:36.984
I always do.

31:37.044 --> 31:39.387
Anyway, Jean and I were going to Taos.

31:39.487 --> 31:40.969
It was a four-day weekend.

31:40.989 --> 31:42.431
We had never been to New Mexico.

31:43.232 --> 31:46.837
And we're sitting at this little inn, a prep it inn in Taos.

31:46.857 --> 31:49.440
It's the very same as maybe the Taos Inn.

31:50.011 --> 31:52.635
And he said, you know, Frank Waters lives in town here.

31:52.655 --> 31:55.600
I took my book, The Colorado, just on the off chance.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.162
Just on the off chance.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.626
Don't tell me you're not a born collector.

31:59.646 --> 32:02.010
But he had not responded to the letter.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.654
So I said, well, maybe we'll give him a call.

32:04.915 --> 32:06.437
Maybe we'll give him a call.

32:06.457 --> 32:07.699
We will give him a call.

32:07.819 --> 32:11.004
I remember sitting on the bed in that little hotel room.

32:11.665 --> 32:15.792
And I told Gene, I said, I can't do it.

32:15.812 --> 32:16.413
Will you please?

32:16.433 --> 32:17.655
And Gene said, OK.

32:18.142 --> 32:29.474
called and Mrs. Waters answered the telephone and she said, I guess Jean had relayed to me that the conversation went something like this.

32:29.534 --> 32:32.858
We just got into town from Phoenix today.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.219
We haven't even unpacked.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.761
Can you come at four?

32:37.022 --> 32:43.929
And gave us directions to go up to Arroyo Staco to a little house that is quite famous now since his death.

32:43.969 --> 32:46.512
It's become more of a shrine to Frank Waters.

32:47.285 --> 32:48.286
We arrived.

32:48.767 --> 32:49.688
We were very gracious.

32:51.149 --> 32:52.310
He was sitting in a chair.

32:52.350 --> 32:54.032
He was suffering fibrosima.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.253
He had an oxygen.

32:55.273 --> 33:05.484
He had the oxygen in the nose sitting there in a sweater and very, very kindly spent an hour with us with this tape recorder running.

33:05.544 --> 33:08.047
I asked if we could tape him, and he said yes.

33:08.467 --> 33:09.508
Because he was used to that.

33:09.548 --> 33:11.330
We didn't know that he was famous.

33:11.831 --> 33:15.975
We never realized he was like the Hemingway of the American West.

33:16.377 --> 33:17.563
I mean, he's like a saint.

33:17.623 --> 33:19.592
He's a god of writing.

33:19.612 --> 33:25.138
He's the only, how to say it, not white man in that.

33:25.490 --> 33:28.113
because he is about 1 16th Indian or something like that.

33:28.133 --> 33:31.196
He's the only person who was ever accepted by the Hopi.

33:31.737 --> 33:37.023
They brought him in, the elders of the tribe explained all of their religious beliefs, which he wrote.

33:37.243 --> 33:38.704
And that's his book there.

33:39.025 --> 33:41.247
And it's an exposition.

33:41.267 --> 33:41.948
Yes, it is.

33:41.968 --> 33:42.549
Congratulations.

33:42.569 --> 33:48.996
And the illustrations in the book are by Nikolai Fajin, who is a Russian painter.

33:49.136 --> 33:51.058
He died, but he was...

33:51.325 --> 33:58.036
They had a station house in Taos where samples of his work can be found.

33:59.258 --> 34:03.765
Before we went to Frank Waters' house... You're not going to tell the story.

34:04.106 --> 34:05.107
Yes, I love it.

34:05.167 --> 34:05.788
It's wonderful.

34:06.389 --> 34:06.690
I love it.

34:06.750 --> 34:12.239
Gene is sitting on the bed in our little hotel room, and he's going, I said, what are you doing?

34:12.840 --> 34:14.422
He said, I'm reading the book.

34:14.583 --> 34:14.903
Oh, my God.

34:16.132 --> 34:16.954
We're going to read the book.

34:16.974 --> 34:17.956
We're going to see the man.

34:17.976 --> 34:18.838
We haven't read the book.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.485
So it was just one of those situations.

34:22.766 --> 34:30.823
And we're looking at the illustrations and trying to finesse this incredible opportunity.

34:31.063 --> 34:33.769
He did sign for me while we were there.

34:35.302 --> 34:40.346
So we did talk about the illustrations, and Frank Waters got very, very upset.

34:40.426 --> 34:47.953
He said they ruined, he said they were beautiful, beautiful illustrations that the publisher destroyed.

34:48.533 --> 34:51.936
They didn't know how to reproduce them.

34:52.797 --> 34:58.822
And Phaechin, of course, I've never seen an original Phaechin.

34:58.882 --> 35:00.463
I don't think you'd get your hands on that.

35:00.483 --> 35:04.667
But when you study Phaechin, then you find out he was also a towering figure.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.666
It's an exquisite condition, isn't it?

35:07.686 --> 35:10.430
It really is.

35:10.450 --> 35:17.019
And that book came out also in an Armed Services Edition.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.523
And looked, though the paper hasn't boxed or anything.

35:20.804 --> 35:23.087
It's remarkable for books of that art.

35:23.107 --> 35:33.861
Just to give you an idea of Frank Waters, Terry Tanner, who is a book dealer and a bibliographer, did a Frank Waters bibliography, which

35:34.347 --> 35:40.054
set at all of his work.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.117
You know, you mentioned that he had probably been interviewed many times.

35:43.157 --> 35:47.643
I wouldn't be at all surprised if you check with the university down there.

35:47.663 --> 35:50.406
I bet there's a terrific oral history on it.

35:50.426 --> 35:50.606
Probably.

35:50.626 --> 35:51.728
University of New Mexico.

35:51.748 --> 35:52.509
Yeah, check that out.

35:52.549 --> 35:54.271
Those oral histories are outstanding.

35:54.651 --> 35:58.255
You know, sometimes you don't even need to do an interview with these people.

35:58.355 --> 36:00.138
They're hundreds of pages long.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.021
They even have his copyright certificate for the book.

36:03.507 --> 36:06.330
which I found an error in Terry Tanner's bibliography.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.151
He had the wrong date for the copyright.

36:09.353 --> 36:10.354
I hated to tell him.

36:10.594 --> 36:12.035
It's not all getting transmitted.

36:12.055 --> 36:15.538
It's getting transmitted, it's not all getting received.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.983
How are you getting the books all this?

36:20.003 --> 36:22.765
We haven't mentioned how you're finding the books and for whom?

36:22.785 --> 36:29.872
Okay, I have book dealers who specialize in the Rivers of America series.

36:30.112 --> 36:31.894
One, my primary

36:32.448 --> 36:36.516
supplier is Gordon Beckhorn, Hastings on Hudson.

36:39.101 --> 36:49.360
There are several other book dealers who specialize, but I think Gordon has been my primary source.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.322
Do you mind if I give him a call?

36:50.442 --> 36:51.424
Oh no, please do.

36:51.604 --> 36:52.566
He would be thrilled.

36:52.934 --> 36:54.255
He's a scholar.

36:54.275 --> 36:56.158
I think he used to be in the publishing business.

36:56.598 --> 36:57.759
You might know him.

36:58.140 --> 37:01.724
You might know of him without realizing who he is.

37:01.824 --> 37:07.450
He is the book dealer who carried the manuscript Primary Colors.

37:08.731 --> 37:09.652
That's great.

37:10.033 --> 37:15.278
That he inadvertently had it in his catalog.

37:16.740 --> 37:17.200
He's the one?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.722
He's the one.

37:19.462 --> 37:20.945
Great, nice going, Gordon.

37:21.125 --> 37:27.118
He had his 15 minutes of fame in the New York Times, you know, the guy who Washington Post is the one that posted.

37:27.399 --> 37:36.778
In fact, we take the New York Observer, which is a peach-colored New York paper, and Gordon had called me one day, and he said, I'm going to

37:37.568 --> 37:38.749
He had ordered some books from him.

37:38.769 --> 37:43.676
He said, I'm going to send you a copy of a newspaper article that you might find amusing.

37:43.936 --> 37:44.797
He told me about it.

37:44.837 --> 37:46.759
And I said, we get the New York Observer.

37:46.779 --> 37:49.283
And I thought it was going to fall off the phone.

37:49.803 --> 37:52.266
Nobody in Fort Lauderdale takes the New York Observer.

37:52.306 --> 37:53.087
And I said, we do.

37:53.848 --> 37:55.370
And they did a story on him.

37:56.492 --> 38:00.456
And he'll be at the symposium.

38:00.977 --> 38:01.598
Good.

38:01.618 --> 38:03.360
I think John Cole has spoken with him.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.764
So he's basically been your primary?

38:06.885 --> 38:07.305
Yes.

38:07.792 --> 38:36.651
generally speaking when you find a good bookseller who knows what you're after they're looking you know a great collector needs a great bookseller absolutely and Gordon let me tell a quick Gordon okay my memory is it was Gordon who participated in this conversation Carol said I'm going to cut I'll probably tell it too quickly but she's saying something like

38:37.238 --> 38:41.529
Oh, well, yeah, I'd like to have that eighth turning of the Hudson.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.018
And there was a pause on the telephone.

38:45.038 --> 38:51.214
And Gordon said, Oh, I see what you're doing.

38:52.055 --> 38:58.084
because she was collecting every printing of every issue of every one of the books in the series.

38:58.765 --> 39:04.293
And he was used to dealing with collectors who won the first edition in good condition with a good dust jacket.

39:04.814 --> 39:08.940
She's saying, oh, I'll take that seventh or eighth or ninth or whatever.

39:08.960 --> 39:12.486
Why is it necessary to get every edition, every printing?

39:12.506 --> 39:16.111
Well, I'm writing a descriptive bibliography of the series.

39:16.612 --> 39:20.678
And if you're writing a descriptive bibliography of the series, you need to have

39:21.232 --> 39:33.107
either examined or owned the books, because you're going to talk about the first printing, the second printing, the third printing, how they differ, the changes in the editorial staff, maybe some changes in the text.

39:33.127 --> 39:33.828
How are you determining this?

39:34.649 --> 39:35.450
You like about the books.

39:35.931 --> 39:37.192
How are you determining?

39:37.212 --> 39:39.715
Are you collating every edition against every other one?

39:40.016 --> 39:46.564
Well, the collations don't change much, but the information in the book does, and with my work,

39:47.118 --> 39:50.982
Theoretically, you should be able to tell the edition without the dust jacket.

39:51.002 --> 39:55.826
The dust jackets are the key for most modern reprints.

39:55.846 --> 40:00.730
So if you pick up one of the Rivers books, you won't know whether it's the second or third or fourth.

40:01.071 --> 40:03.933
And there were changes in the editorial staff over the years.

40:04.634 --> 40:08.838
The original editor, Constance Lindsay Skinner, died in 1939.

40:09.398 --> 40:15.724
Then Stephen Vincent Binet and Carl Carmer became co-editors.

40:16.045 --> 40:16.585
Binet

40:17.290 --> 40:17.971
dropped dead.

40:18.572 --> 40:21.656
How do we spell Carmer?

40:22.638 --> 40:23.238
C-A-R-M-E-R.

40:23.299 --> 40:32.972
Binet died suddenly in 1943, and Herbie Allen was brought in as the general editor.

40:33.453 --> 40:34.975
You know the name?

40:34.995 --> 40:40.543
Herbie Allen, the great novelist, Anthony Adler, sold copies or whatever it was.

40:41.785 --> 40:46.251
But anyway, he became editor of the series, and then Carl Carmer

40:46.400 --> 40:50.163
was brought back to co-edit the series with Herbie Allen.

40:50.964 --> 40:52.906
Allen died suddenly in 1959.

40:53.086 --> 40:56.349
It wasn't a great thing to be an editor.

40:56.369 --> 40:57.990
Sounds like there's a curse here.

40:58.010 --> 41:04.676
And then Carl Carmer continues the edit of the series until it ended in 1974.

41:04.776 --> 41:05.517
Stop.

41:06.478 --> 41:09.961
Back to the question.

41:09.981 --> 41:10.201
Collation.

41:10.661 --> 41:11.342
Yes, you do.

41:12.343 --> 41:15.285
She does the collation of every criminal.

41:15.385 --> 41:16.086
And I'm not sure...

41:17.163 --> 41:24.911
Nick, whether you realize what's in this book she's written, in addition to the bibliographical material.

41:25.852 --> 41:30.957
There is a biography of every one of these 60 authors, every one of the 55 illustrators.

41:31.177 --> 41:31.838
You've done all this?

41:32.178 --> 41:33.259
She's done all that.

41:33.299 --> 41:34.400
I have tracked.

41:34.560 --> 41:39.125
There's a publishing history of the whole thing through at least three different publishing houses.

41:39.665 --> 41:42.208
There are write-ups on the editors, the art editors.

41:43.302 --> 41:45.245
Who were these people?

41:45.605 --> 41:51.114
There's a biography of a good biographical sketch of Skinner.

41:52.315 --> 41:56.081
This is a... I've never seen a bibliography like that.

41:56.101 --> 41:58.104
What's the state of the bibliography right now?

41:58.124 --> 42:01.509
Well... Did you latch onto this?

42:01.529 --> 42:04.133
That's the... You were writing while she was talking about this.

42:04.253 --> 42:09.601
And this is... Tanner's around here.

42:09.681 --> 42:10.642
He's a very nice fellow.

42:11.464 --> 42:12.465
But let me know.

42:14.504 --> 42:24.040
She works at nights, weekends, and holidays.

42:25.142 --> 42:28.207
The only time she doesn't work is when we're out of the country on vacation.

42:29.168 --> 42:31.633
And even then, I think she's working on it in her head.

42:31.653 --> 42:33.796
But here are some examples.

42:33.856 --> 42:37.342
The pink sheets are finished.

42:37.362 --> 42:39.145
No, virtually finished.

42:40.964 --> 42:43.288
This is, you know, you're familiar with these.

42:43.308 --> 42:43.728
Oh, yeah.

42:43.748 --> 42:44.549
Oh, of course, yeah.

42:44.569 --> 42:48.576
There were only, what, four that got admitted into the farm services.

42:50.078 --> 42:50.699
Okay.

42:50.719 --> 42:56.247
Here's... Here are a couple.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.571
Here's the Arkansas and the Granby one.

42:58.591 --> 43:00.754
Do you have somebody who's going to publish this already?

43:01.055 --> 43:05.702
Well, John Cole told me not to worry about it.

43:05.722 --> 43:06.583
I love John.

43:07.373 --> 43:09.135
John says not to worry.

43:11.017 --> 43:13.420
He went a little further than that.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.004
She has a lot of her job, which pretty much says it.

43:16.104 --> 43:20.189
Well, this deserves to be... Well, get your book published.

43:20.209 --> 43:22.912
If it's jointly pressed with a university cross-site, you know.

43:24.053 --> 43:25.635
Am I the only one that's beginning to get cool?

43:26.256 --> 43:27.117
Are you cool?

43:27.137 --> 43:27.718
I'm fine.

43:27.738 --> 43:28.158
You're okay?

43:28.178 --> 43:31.182
One of the reasons these books are still in good condition.

43:31.202 --> 43:31.663
It's too cool.

43:31.783 --> 43:33.265
It doesn't matter which way it goes.

43:34.086 --> 43:36.148
We never open the windows because of these...

43:36.382 --> 43:37.724
The way we live.

43:37.744 --> 43:40.608
Let me know also when you're ready for another pile of coffee.

43:40.628 --> 43:41.830
Take two minutes.

43:42.030 --> 43:43.392
That's cold by now.

43:44.354 --> 43:50.964
So these, what you're showing me here, these are... Let me show you how this is set up.

43:50.984 --> 43:53.367
This will be the first edition, first printing.

43:54.569 --> 43:58.535
The first edition, third printing, first Reinhardt, probably fall of 1947.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.358
And you go through all this.

44:00.418 --> 44:01.760
I mean, who cares, really?

44:01.780 --> 44:03.402
But somebody might care then.

44:05.693 --> 44:06.914
excerpts from the archives.

44:06.934 --> 44:08.256
So where are some of the excerpts?

44:08.276 --> 44:11.239
And then I'll go into the biography of the author.

44:12.881 --> 44:19.047
Is it possible for this piece that I'm writing, do you have copies of these that I can borrow or read?

44:19.067 --> 44:21.570
I'm not going to impinge on anything that you're doing.

44:21.590 --> 44:21.830
Okay.

44:21.850 --> 44:24.273
But just to give an example of what this... Sure.

44:24.293 --> 44:24.653
Yes.

44:24.673 --> 44:25.734
I don't have any problem.

44:26.115 --> 44:30.099
Here is a biography of the illustrator.

44:30.840 --> 44:34.924
And this one's not a really good one because it's just about the...

44:35.680 --> 44:40.287
Here's... You know, maybe you could select some things and mail them to me.

44:40.347 --> 44:41.248
That would be fine.

44:41.268 --> 44:42.791
Well, we could do something there.

44:42.811 --> 44:45.975
Here's the Allagash, which was a later book.

44:45.995 --> 44:50.302
This came out in 1968, but it was... Yeah, Maine.

44:50.622 --> 44:55.930
And Lou Deeks, he was... He's still living.

44:56.371 --> 44:57.893
There's a great, great quote.

44:57.913 --> 44:58.574
What city was it?

44:59.075 --> 44:59.856
Rockport, Maine.

45:00.136 --> 45:01.418
He says, when I got to Rockport,

45:03.018 --> 45:05.602
There were three Democrats in the whole town.

45:06.864 --> 45:10.529
The garbage man, the town drunk, and me.

45:10.729 --> 45:14.154
George Lowe, the illustrator, I believe he will be at the symposium.

45:14.174 --> 45:15.336
Have you got an about thee?

45:15.356 --> 45:18.200
Yeah, about thee.

45:18.220 --> 45:26.072
So in the section about thee, then I have when they signed the agreement covering the writing of the allegation.

45:26.525 --> 45:28.327
advance of $2,000.

45:29.008 --> 45:30.070
It gives a little history.

45:30.090 --> 45:31.552
Where are you getting all of this now?

45:31.852 --> 45:33.634
Where are you getting all of this information from?

45:33.674 --> 45:34.415
Henry Holden Company.

45:34.696 --> 45:35.597
That's my publisher.

45:35.617 --> 45:38.741
So the publishers are being very... Henry Holden Company.

45:39.762 --> 45:40.243
Unbelievable.

45:41.024 --> 45:42.526
Here are the files and records.

45:42.846 --> 45:43.067
Wonderful.

45:43.107 --> 45:45.630
Copy anything you like without any restrictions.

45:45.998 --> 45:48.202
Give us a buzz down the hole.

45:48.242 --> 45:49.745
You may know, what's her name, Kaplan?

45:49.765 --> 45:50.526
Muriel Kaplan.

45:50.667 --> 45:51.749
Oh, you know Muriel.

45:51.769 --> 45:52.831
Muriel's wonderful.

45:52.971 --> 45:54.854
Muriel's going to be at the symposium.

45:54.874 --> 45:55.976
We're 10 feet away from her.

45:55.997 --> 45:57.760
She says, let us know if you need anything.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.202
Make all the copies you like.

45:59.743 --> 46:00.785
They dedicated a copy.

46:00.825 --> 46:03.711
They gave me Bruna's boardroom.

46:03.731 --> 46:04.392
And guess what?

46:04.492 --> 46:06.696
The first drawer says, says Robert Frost.

46:06.716 --> 46:07.778
I said, hmm, I know that.

46:07.859 --> 46:09.762
Pull the drawer up and take out the contract.

46:09.742 --> 46:13.086
This is the way I have it set up.

46:13.106 --> 46:18.131
I mean, this is just, you know, it has the contents and the preface.

46:18.412 --> 46:22.476
You should offer this to Holt.

46:22.636 --> 46:24.238
They have seen it.

46:24.458 --> 46:26.621
They don't know that they can market a bibliography.

46:27.482 --> 46:28.523
They may change their minds.

46:29.464 --> 46:32.568
They were the only publisher interested in my book.

46:33.368 --> 46:34.770
I bet they're glad.

46:35.206 --> 46:37.369
They were very glad.

46:37.389 --> 46:42.215
They've done a History of the Rivers series, and this goes, you know, on.

46:42.335 --> 46:47.061
They were very complimentary about this manuscript.

46:47.121 --> 46:47.862
Very complimentary.

46:47.962 --> 46:49.044
They were frank about it.

46:49.064 --> 46:51.246
Which editor did you show it to?

46:51.266 --> 46:53.149
Just Holt and Vanderbilt University Press.

46:53.169 --> 46:53.689
No, no, no.

46:53.750 --> 46:54.490
Which editor Holt?

46:55.031 --> 46:56.613
Oh, Bill Sussbaum.

46:56.914 --> 46:58.175
He's editor-in-chief.

46:58.195 --> 47:02.040
Got a nice letter back from him, about four pages.

47:02.712 --> 47:07.921
Then each of the publishers that participated in the publication gets a look.

47:07.941 --> 47:10.946
And then there's the biopsies of the editor, here's Skinner.

47:10.966 --> 47:15.975
And then the map makers, they were very important.

47:17.998 --> 47:21.244
I'm in awe of...

47:21.730 --> 47:46.877
uh what you what you're doing here yeah but it's it's putting this is packaging this whole series do you have all the books by the way they're all here so so so you have the complete series oh i have i have first editions i don't there were about a little bit over 350 more than 350 printings and editions but there were 65 books in the series i've got first editions of all 65 and all the signed limited editions

47:47.110 --> 47:49.553
I've got the Songs of the Rivers of America.

47:49.733 --> 47:51.134
How did you do this in 10 years?

47:51.515 --> 47:54.218
I mean, I'm amazed these were available out there.

47:54.438 --> 47:57.261
It's very difficult to find them in good condition now.

47:57.281 --> 47:58.262
They're very collected.

47:58.282 --> 47:59.904
What was the most elusive title?

48:02.286 --> 48:02.546
I know.

48:03.067 --> 48:03.427
I know.

48:04.288 --> 48:04.528
Yeah.

48:04.769 --> 48:05.690
The Brandywine.

48:08.232 --> 48:09.514
This one.

48:09.534 --> 48:10.315
Let me open it for you.

48:10.335 --> 48:12.977
That's the one with the Andrew Wyeth illustrations.

48:12.997 --> 48:14.759
More than that.

48:14.779 --> 48:16.341
That's inscribed by

48:17.047 --> 48:28.259
The author and the special Delaware edition of the brand new one is printed exclusively for the Greenwood Bookshop and is limited to 650 copies each signed by the author and the artist.

48:28.279 --> 48:28.960
And there you have one.

48:28.980 --> 48:29.941
And this is number 340.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.304
Pretty good.

48:32.884 --> 48:38.170
That was the most elusive, except there's one you don't have.

48:38.190 --> 48:38.831
Which one is that?

48:39.351 --> 48:40.232
Indianapolis.

48:40.272 --> 48:40.933
No, I have it.

48:40.993 --> 48:42.835
I don't have it in Dust Jackets.

48:42.855 --> 48:42.975
Oh.

48:42.995 --> 48:45.518
This is probably my most precious book here.

48:46.173 --> 48:46.874
Which is?

48:48.095 --> 48:49.357
It's a copy of St.

48:49.477 --> 48:53.723
Croix, which was written by James Taylor Dunn.

48:54.344 --> 48:56.747
Jim Dunn will be the symposium.

48:56.767 --> 49:05.778
Published in 19... Let the interview arrive.

49:05.798 --> 49:08.842
1965, I had to get my date straight.

49:09.383 --> 49:13.969
This was given to Mr. Dunn by the publisher, which you might want to...

49:14.675 --> 49:17.278
Let's just hold it very gently here.

49:17.298 --> 49:18.980
A special long copy of the St.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.085
Coy, the manager of the author, December 1965, at UT Ring.

49:24.105 --> 49:26.328
Hold on.

49:26.348 --> 49:29.411
Look at all the inscriptions on this.

49:29.431 --> 49:34.837
The special copy is for Carol Fitzgerald, with many thanks for her dedicated work on the Rivers series.

49:35.218 --> 49:37.200
Jim, great.

49:37.480 --> 49:39.783
He gave it to me.

49:39.803 --> 49:40.223
That's wonderful.

49:40.303 --> 49:44.648
The last time she described that book out of public lecture she was giving,

49:45.522 --> 49:46.403
The tears flowed.

49:47.885 --> 49:48.086
Yeah.

49:48.306 --> 49:54.675
And he put a picture of himself in the editorial staff, and that's a very nice addition.

49:54.715 --> 49:56.597
When did the series stop?

49:56.617 --> 49:58.019
1974.

49:58.199 --> 50:04.087
And were they satisfied that it was completed, or did they get one out of juice?

50:04.368 --> 50:08.774
Well, I think that Carl Carman must have been very ill back in those days.

50:08.834 --> 50:14.061
I don't know if I'm sure he died in 1976, I understand, from...

50:14.918 --> 50:21.484
Margaret Sanborn, who wrote the last book in the series, The American, that they were just using his name.

50:21.784 --> 50:28.590
He was really not participating to the degree that an editor should.

50:28.931 --> 50:33.935
Pace Barnes was the editor of the series in those days.

50:34.035 --> 50:35.597
She was here in South Florida.

50:36.017 --> 50:38.079
She was editor from 67 to 74.

50:39.100 --> 50:42.563
She will be at the symposium also.

50:42.723 --> 50:43.744
She's still quite young.

50:44.112 --> 50:48.438
But I think the tastes changed.

50:48.458 --> 50:56.708
Maybe Ed Holt, Reinhardt, and Winston, maybe they just didn't see the value of continuing this.

50:57.329 --> 50:59.172
They were in the business of selling books.

50:59.192 --> 51:00.874
Maybe they weren't selling, I don't know.

51:01.234 --> 51:02.516
Maybe they weren't marketing them.

51:02.536 --> 51:07.803
Maybe they just didn't have an editorial core that cared about that type of literature.

51:08.323 --> 51:11.908
Maybe what Anita was a new young editor that believed in the project.

51:12.074 --> 51:16.059
So, do you have any sense of what the original goal was?

51:16.179 --> 51:17.541
How many rivers?

51:17.641 --> 51:18.162
Yes, 24.

51:19.003 --> 51:25.131
In her essay, Skinner set out 24 rivers.

51:25.551 --> 51:27.794
So they far exceeded her original plan.

51:27.814 --> 51:29.055
Oh, absolutely.

51:29.636 --> 51:31.919
These were making money for Reinhardt.

51:31.939 --> 51:39.769
During the war years, the research I have done indicates that they had to sell books in order to get paper.

51:40.475 --> 51:48.566
The paper they were allotted during the war years was directly related to how many books they could sell.

51:48.586 --> 51:51.189
And these were selling regionally.

51:51.370 --> 51:55.696
What do you suspect the attraction was the fascination for these books?

51:55.716 --> 51:57.939
I think people were not able to travel.

51:58.179 --> 52:09.334
I think that the state guides from the WPA had... I think there was a... The depression, in my judgment,

52:10.158 --> 52:13.703
made the nation look inward.

52:13.803 --> 52:20.852
America began to look at herself and say, who are we and what are we and how is this, how can this happen?

52:20.872 --> 52:27.321
Roosevelt's famous quote, one third of the nation, ill clothed, ill fed, ill housed.

52:27.341 --> 52:39.557
And a nation that had every wealth, every wealth on earth, including its people, they began to look inward and the Federal Writers Project and the Federal Theater Project and the Federal Arts Project, which were almost

52:39.790 --> 52:48.719
divine gifts to the country, I think, on a par with the GI Bill of Rights, for instance, which, you know, what that did for this country.

52:49.260 --> 52:57.288
The country began to look inward, and we had this marvelous woman who was a Canadian by birth and had a newspaper woman.

52:57.368 --> 53:00.050
A lot of these authors, by the way, were journalists.

53:00.171 --> 53:02.433
I'm on the river stand.

53:03.214 --> 53:08.599
And it was, this is a major part of a much bigger scene of

53:08.815 --> 53:09.856
series Americana.

53:10.497 --> 53:19.846
The lakes of America, the trail, the trail series, the port series, the American folkways, and there's probably another dozen.

53:19.866 --> 53:24.871
By the way, if there's ever a second book from her, it'll be on other series Americana.

53:24.891 --> 53:27.033
Well, are you collecting in other areas?

53:27.073 --> 53:27.694
Oh, yes.

53:28.234 --> 53:32.158
I have rather complete collections in many other series Americana.

53:32.198 --> 53:36.983
There's even, I'll take them to the next room, there's even a series on

53:37.975 --> 53:38.976
regional murders.

53:41.079 --> 53:41.580
There is.

53:42.061 --> 53:43.362
There is.

53:43.463 --> 53:47.568
And you're collecting that.

53:47.749 --> 53:48.510
Mm-hmm.

53:49.411 --> 53:51.794
Do you foresee doing the same kind of project?

53:51.874 --> 53:54.598
Not to the extent that I've done with the Rivers.

53:54.638 --> 54:02.349
The other theories really cannot compare to the Rivers theories in the scope and the size and the interest.

54:04.412 --> 54:06.835
This was just an extraordinary literary

54:07.186 --> 54:13.132
What's the name of the symposium at the Library of Congress?

54:13.152 --> 54:15.054
I believe it will be the Rivers of America.

54:15.154 --> 54:17.957
So this is a symposium being put together at the Library of Congress.

54:18.637 --> 54:20.539
It's based on my work.

54:21.280 --> 54:23.822
Essentially, what is your work?

54:24.363 --> 54:25.244
Exactly.

54:25.304 --> 54:35.674
I have provided John Cole with all of the information, all of the bios on the living authors, the names, addresses, background on the book,

54:36.346 --> 54:41.371
And we have met several times in the past few months.

54:41.391 --> 54:43.614
Jean and I were in Washington in November.

54:44.254 --> 54:48.339
John's been down here about three times, so we're here tomorrow to spend a couple of hours.

54:48.359 --> 54:48.919
John's coming to talk.

54:48.939 --> 54:49.120
Tomorrow?

54:49.140 --> 54:49.921
Yeah, I would say.

54:50.581 --> 54:57.629
And we spent time with Carol in Vanderbilt when her elections owner said that she gave a lecture on the series.

54:57.649 --> 54:58.770
Did you know that?

54:58.790 --> 54:59.371
No, I didn't.

54:59.391 --> 55:00.632
Do you have a copy of the lecture?

55:01.743 --> 55:03.265
that you could send to me?

55:03.325 --> 55:04.706
Again, it's not something I have to say.

55:05.006 --> 55:06.007
No, that's okay.

55:06.808 --> 55:09.912
I think that's supposed to be reprinted in the Vanderbilt Chronicle.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.915
They asked to reprint my talk.

55:12.935 --> 55:15.517
It was the bicentennial of the state of Tennessee.

55:15.537 --> 55:19.622
Vanderbilt was to do quarterly exhibits.

55:19.642 --> 55:25.228
They chose for one quarter the Rivers of America series using my collection here.

55:25.528 --> 55:30.433
I shipped them up about 100 books from my collection in ephemera.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.265
trying to concentrate on Tennessee.

55:34.285 --> 55:43.317
I mean, I sent all 65 books, but we set the cases out to highlight the Tennessee rivers.

55:43.337 --> 55:45.059
And it was very, very successful.

55:45.139 --> 55:47.322
In fact, it was extended twice.

55:47.923 --> 55:50.346
I didn't get the books back until Christmas time.

55:50.366 --> 55:51.387
Bad timing.

55:52.348 --> 55:59.858
All the little places in the bookshelf had been taken up with other things, so I had to find a place for four crates of books.

55:59.878 --> 56:01.380
Are all the books here?

56:01.400 --> 56:01.500
Yeah.

56:01.868 --> 56:04.432
And how many do you have in the collection?

56:04.513 --> 56:06.316
I know you probably gave it to me earlier.

56:06.416 --> 56:17.054
Probably, I would say about 320, but I am still lacking some of the... And what are some of the ones that you're seeing?

56:17.315 --> 56:18.777
Well, it'll be the reprints.

56:18.797 --> 56:23.185
It's like maybe the paperback reprint from the University of Nebraska Press that

56:23.536 --> 56:24.879
Maybe it's the third printing.

56:24.939 --> 56:29.109
In order just to give a complete publishing history of series.

56:29.230 --> 56:32.698
Will you be able to go ahead and complete the bibliography?

56:33.099 --> 56:37.509
In a bibliography such as this, what I'm missing are minor books.

56:37.830 --> 56:42.000
And if I have to go to press, I will just have to say, not seen.

56:42.368 --> 56:43.309
And that's okay.

56:43.489 --> 56:44.150
That's okay.

56:44.170 --> 56:44.611
That's right.

56:44.631 --> 56:51.178
You do the best you can, and people will eventually fill in, but I'm not missing any major piece.

56:51.198 --> 56:54.321
And what's the working title of the bibliography?

56:58.246 --> 57:10.840
Maybe I can get a... It is The Rivers of America, a descriptive bibliography, including biographies of the authors, illustrators, and editors by Carol Fitzgerald, 1990?

57:10.904 --> 57:11.805
It was maybe 2,000.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.967
$1.99.

57:13.987 --> 57:15.068
I love that.

57:15.088 --> 57:18.450
Do you have a fax here right away?

57:18.470 --> 57:18.631
Sure.

57:18.851 --> 57:21.413
Maybe we could fax a few things back and forth, too.

57:21.693 --> 57:25.837
It's 954-463-9509.

57:26.137 --> 57:28.299
Okay, that's your fax.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.543
Let me just briefly go down this chronology.

57:33.703 --> 57:40.489
I wanted to throw out a few names that might mean something to you as far as illustrators and authors.

57:40.975 --> 57:54.856
Thomas D. Clark, you may not know the name.

57:57.640 --> 58:06.173
He is a Kentucky historian, a long-term professor at the University of Kentucky.

58:06.423 --> 58:16.176
expert in that field, probably the Civil War too, but when Ken Burns did the Civil War, he was one of the narrators, you know, when they interviewed various people.

58:16.196 --> 58:27.351
Edgar Lee Masters wrote a book in the series, and his book was illustrated by Lind Ward, who, do you know the name?

58:28.175 --> 58:29.176
Everybody knows one.

58:29.196 --> 58:31.939
I know Edgar Lee Masters' son, Hilary Masters.

58:32.159 --> 58:34.381
I've corresponded with him.

58:34.762 --> 58:37.905
He's going to be invited to the symposium to attend.

58:37.925 --> 58:39.486
The Spoon River Anthology.

58:39.506 --> 58:41.348
That was his father's book.

58:41.368 --> 58:42.089
Precisely.

58:42.109 --> 58:44.711
Which caused a scandal at the time.

58:44.752 --> 58:45.913
Can I see the title?

58:45.993 --> 58:47.234
I know I have it on the table.

58:47.314 --> 58:50.657
I'll make a copy for you.

58:51.238 --> 58:55.402
Frederick Way was a riverboat captain.

58:55.442 --> 58:57.304
He wrote the book on the Allegheny.

58:57.942 --> 59:03.769
River, but his book was illustrated by Henry C. Pitt.

59:03.789 --> 59:06.092
You may be familiar with him your way.

59:06.132 --> 59:07.393
He was from Philadelphia.

59:08.214 --> 59:10.437
August Derla, does that mean anything to you?

59:11.418 --> 59:11.478
No.

59:11.498 --> 59:16.685
Okay, he wrote the Wisconsin... John Stuart Curry, the artist.

59:16.745 --> 59:19.047
These were people back in the 40s.

59:19.728 --> 59:20.489
Hodding Carter.

59:21.010 --> 59:22.151
Hodding Carter, I know.

59:22.171 --> 59:24.574
Okay, Hodding Carter wrote Lower Mississippi.

59:25.111 --> 59:28.695
Henry Bestin is the outer... Very famous.

59:28.935 --> 59:30.697
Yes, he wrote the book on St.

59:30.717 --> 59:31.618
Lawrence.

59:31.638 --> 59:33.079
It was illustrated by A.Y.

59:33.179 --> 59:38.885
Jackson, who was a Canadian artist and was one of the Group of Seven.

59:41.327 --> 59:44.611
Very famous in Canada, the Group of Seven, with our whole museum.

59:44.631 --> 59:51.217
Harry Hanson, who was the newspaper man, wrote the Chicago, illustrated by Harry Timmons.

59:51.277 --> 59:52.318
How do these books sell?

59:52.338 --> 59:53.920
Do you have publication figures?

59:54.895 --> 59:59.363
Yes, to some degree.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:05.334
You can tell by the number of reprints that they were, usually the print runs were 5,000.

01:00:05.634 --> 01:00:12.306
Some of the bigger books, like the Potomac by Frederick Gutham, I think they printed 10,000.

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:15.031
The Ohio had a print run of 20,000.

01:00:15.832 --> 01:00:18.557
Which do you think was the best-selling book?

01:00:19.448 --> 01:00:20.369
of the whole series?

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.312
Which one might have been the most popular one?

01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:29.321
I think the most popular one to date is The Everglades River of Grass by Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

01:00:29.401 --> 01:00:30.863
Mrs. Douglas is still living.

01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:32.486
She's 107 years old.

01:00:32.706 --> 01:00:33.267
It's April.

01:00:34.689 --> 01:00:49.168
Her book went through seven printings during the time of the books were published by Reinhardt and

01:00:49.992 --> 01:00:52.435
I just want to write down this whole Reinhardt and Winston.

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:55.779
Look at the condition that you've got, which is magnificent.

01:00:55.799 --> 01:00:56.280
Excuse me.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.101
Go ahead.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.002
The man knows books.

01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:14.203
The book was then, came out in a revised edition that she published herself, two editions, Hurricane House, then it was printed by Banyan Books in 1978.

01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:15.905
Excuse me.

01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:17.687
In 19...

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:24.635
In 1974, Mockingbird Books brought out the book in a paperback.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.176
It's gone through 12 printings.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:37.006
In 1988, Pineapple Press began publishing the book with a new afterword by the author, and they have gone through six.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:41.149
Notice the Floridian Publishers.

01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:44.132
Hurricane House, Pineapple Press, Mockingbird Press.

01:01:45.233 --> 01:01:45.994
What's it missing?

01:01:46.174 --> 01:01:48.636
Was every book illustrated?

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:55.258
The Cape Fear was not illustrated, and I believe it was the only one that was not.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.101
I don't know why.

01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:59.464
The author died before the book came out.

01:02:00.766 --> 01:02:09.898
It doesn't make sense why they did not include illustrations, but it wasn't.

01:02:11.532 --> 01:02:14.637
saint of the environmentalist movement in Florida.

01:02:14.957 --> 01:02:17.361
And she has given her name to so many of these things.

01:02:17.621 --> 01:02:26.254
Even the Department of Natural Resources, which has a skyscraper building in the state capital Tallahassee, called the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Law building.

01:02:26.314 --> 01:02:36.029
My sense is that these books individually probably are not really expensive books.

01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.209
Okay.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.553
Well, let me ask a question.

01:02:38.573 --> 01:02:38.653
Yes.
