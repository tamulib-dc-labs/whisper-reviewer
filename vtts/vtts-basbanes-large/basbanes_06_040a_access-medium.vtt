WEBVTT

00:07.473 --> 00:36.180
Well, we have an editorial board, which consists of David McKittrick, he's a librarian at Trinity College, Cambridge, Alan Bell, who's the librarian of the Rhodes House Library at Oxford, and Ted Hoffman, who used to be an independent bookseller, but is now with Bernard Quaritch, and Steve Weissman at Simones.

00:36.835 --> 00:43.162
And we, all of us, write bits of it.

00:45.305 --> 01:00.502
It complicates matters that things like the longer features like the sale notes and reviews of booksellers' catalogs are often written by several of us, you know, on a sort of paragraph by paragraph or even sentence by sentence basis.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.404
We work very much as a team.

01:03.245 --> 01:06.589
Every now and again, of course, particularly with obituaries,

01:07.700 --> 01:11.525
other people write contributions to it.

01:11.565 --> 01:27.303
And sometimes people will... I mean, people do know the advantages of exposure in news and comment as opposed to a full-length book review.

01:27.383 --> 01:31.328
I mean, somebody who's perhaps produced a very big grand exhibition catalogue

01:31.696 --> 01:37.568
for example, will send us a copy and say, do you think you could find room for a paragraph on this in news and comment?

01:37.628 --> 01:47.427
And I like to do this because I know actually that it's the most heavily read section, which is the one section that everybody who gets it always reads.

01:47.607 --> 01:54.160
So you know that you're giving people who may or may not read book reviews, but they always read news and comment.

02:01.936 --> 02:03.658
Are you an active collector yourself?

02:11.086 --> 02:23.979
You remind me, there's a lovely poem, I can't quite eat it, from memory, by Lord Dunsany, which runs something like this, you'll have to forgive my own blame, parody.

02:27.923 --> 02:29.445
Were you proud, Helen,

02:30.674 --> 02:40.826
to send so many brave men to their deaths, to see the destruction of ships, to see a whole city burned to the ground.

02:44.650 --> 02:45.111
Proud?

02:45.151 --> 02:46.792
I'll say I was.

02:49.956 --> 02:57.745
And, no, you can't cure me.

02:59.902 --> 03:23.766
any other notes to come well i have one you're fairly well known um nicholas for not for your dilatoriness so much as your tardiness how do you think about music coming up to date it's fairly uh current perhaps that

03:25.940 --> 03:29.124
No, I won't tell anybody.

03:30.967 --> 03:40.740
You may notice that I arrived, I was standing decently early for lunch today, that they had to send out for you and tell them.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.424
Well, yes, I reckon.

03:44.345 --> 03:47.149
I have terrible trouble with my telephone bill in the British Library.

03:47.169 --> 03:49.152
They've now started monitoring the telephone bill.

03:49.172 --> 03:49.973
It's been discovered.

03:50.341 --> 04:00.418
that my telephone bill is actually ten times as big as the telephone bill of anybody else in the British Library.

04:00.518 --> 04:09.753
It'll be seen if it's me to explain to them that I actually do ten times as much work as the British Library and the telephone is an essential part of this.

04:12.337 --> 04:15.302
My working day starts usually around six o'clock.

04:16.058 --> 04:25.932
And I work from 6 until breakfast time, at which point the telephone starts ringing, thus making me late for my first appointment of the day.

04:27.454 --> 04:31.981
The fact that I'm late for the first appointment of the day usually has a knock-on effect for the rest of the day.

04:32.521 --> 04:38.750
And my last appointment, which is going to bed at night, is usually also postponed.

04:38.770 --> 04:39.211
I don't know.

04:39.291 --> 04:44.378
It comes with trying to cram too much into the day and not saying no to enough people.

04:45.961 --> 04:48.303
Have I ever said no to you?

04:48.383 --> 04:50.085
Thank you for coming today.

04:50.105 --> 04:53.047
Have I ever said no to you, Marcus?

04:53.107 --> 04:55.609
No, never.

04:55.970 --> 05:00.474
Few people have lived to tell the tale.

05:00.814 --> 05:02.495
Never, ever.

05:02.515 --> 05:07.880
Thank you very much.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.882
So I would just contact you at the British Library.

05:11.363 --> 05:15.006
Let me give you the address.

05:15.222 --> 05:18.526
It's the British Library.

05:18.566 --> 05:20.207
Great Russell Street.

05:20.227 --> 05:21.489
Uh-huh.

05:21.509 --> 05:22.250
London.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.012
WC1B.

05:25.433 --> 05:25.633
Uh-huh.

05:25.653 --> 05:29.197
3DG.

05:29.417 --> 05:30.699
3 Delta Golf.

05:30.999 --> 05:31.600
That's right.

05:35.624 --> 05:37.946
Great Russell.

05:37.966 --> 05:38.227
It's lovely.

05:38.407 --> 05:39.208
I've been there.

05:39.228 --> 05:41.470
It's a very magical place to walk into.

05:41.490 --> 05:41.610
Right.

05:44.593 --> 05:45.094
I guess...

05:46.745 --> 06:01.122
Does anyone, to your knowledge, one of the areas I'm going to be looking into is, we'll start with an anecdote of Rosenwald's and his book, Recollections of a Collector, where he recalls having told... Hi, Georgia.

06:01.282 --> 06:03.585
Nice to see you again.

06:03.605 --> 06:05.667
Nice to see you again.

06:05.687 --> 06:05.847
Yeah.

06:06.268 --> 06:08.310
I've heard him lecture twice in a week.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.052
I'm practicing three times.

06:10.513 --> 06:11.714
Three times?

06:12.435 --> 06:13.216
That's pretty good.

06:13.236 --> 06:15.098
In a month.

06:15.297 --> 06:25.811
Who, to your knowledge, collects the unspeakable things for the sake of preserving them, like anti-Semitic things or racist things?

06:25.831 --> 06:35.483
And I'm reminded of Rosenwald's purchase of this Trent document and that manuscript, which he then gave to an organization in Waltham to keep in perpetuity.

06:35.503 --> 06:41.271
And three years ago, they sold it at South East for $176,000 for the whole purpose of it.

06:41.740 --> 06:54.600
The Council of Trent trial... Well, it's a trial of the Jews and some such thing.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.624
And it basically justified anti-Semitic.

06:59.928 --> 07:03.994
But the point was, he told Rosenbach, price is no logic.

07:04.054 --> 07:06.218
I mean, he never said that when he bought the Gutenberg Bible.

07:06.418 --> 07:07.900
And this was something he detested.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.823
He didn't even want to put it in his own collection.

07:10.276 --> 07:13.742
And I'm just wondering if this is a worthy area for me to pursue.

07:14.182 --> 07:18.169
Are there people who feel so motivated to collect these hateful things?

07:18.629 --> 07:21.815
I'll see you later tonight.

07:21.835 --> 07:25.841
I should have enjoyed that.

07:25.921 --> 07:28.806
Is it an interesting area, do you think?

07:28.946 --> 07:29.888
I don't think so.

07:29.908 --> 07:33.313
I mean, in the first place, I don't believe that anybody's ever devoted...

07:33.968 --> 07:54.880
I mean, people have devoted time to collecting suppressed books, dirty books, politically hot books, this sort of thing.

07:58.285 --> 08:13.928
usually incidentally rather than, I mean, just like, I mean, Mr. Rosenwald buying that was very much a backwater, a sideline of what he was really interested in.

08:13.948 --> 08:16.913
He said he didn't want it to fall into the hands of the Nazis.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.617
Well, it was the Nazis.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.420
He didn't want them to get it.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.822
And he didn't even want to keep it.

08:22.842 --> 08:27.128
Then he gave it to another... Anyway, it was just an interesting... How do you feel about

08:27.428 --> 08:29.874
great collections like the Bradley Martin collection.

08:29.954 --> 08:35.087
Now here is what is said to be the finest ornithological falling into private.

08:35.208 --> 08:44.391
I'm desperately sad that it's been broken up, not on account of the color plate books, which are in a sense neither here nor there, but because of the staggering collection of

08:45.417 --> 09:14.395
of uh you know commercially worthless little books called the avi fauna of guatemala or something like that which which which it cost him nothing but there they all were but i mean the other fact is bradley whom i knew quite well over a long time had had plenty of time to think and had plenty of uh plenty of uh opportunities for

09:15.353 --> 09:21.561
keeping his collection together if he'd wanted to, and he clearly decided not to, and so is my way to say.

09:21.581 --> 09:43.909
It is suggested by some people who would be in a position to know that there was a, I don't know if it's a codicil, but there was something in his will to the effect that if the trustees are able to keep this together as a collection and in the process derive less money, they should feel free to go ahead and do this.

09:44.243 --> 09:52.091
But the Bessemer Trust, which were the executives of the estate, said their responsibility was to maximize the return, and they ignored that.

09:52.652 --> 09:56.676
I've heard this suggested by somebody who you know is American.

09:56.696 --> 10:03.363
Well, I mean, obviously the only sensible way to find out that is to get hold of a copy of his will and see if it's there.

10:03.443 --> 10:13.474
But it seems to me it's somewhat out of character, because Bradley was a person who knew his own mind, and I can't see him... I can't see him...

10:14.348 --> 10:28.966
Well, it is said in the first catalogue of the wholesale in 1911, Beverly Chew quotes, he was saying, well, if it weren't for collectors, where would I have gotten my books?

10:29.066 --> 10:32.230
And this is suggested in the first volume of the Martin catalogue.

10:32.550 --> 10:38.478
Do you think he was thinking of collectors of the upcoming generations?

10:40.019 --> 10:42.162
Well, I mean, I...

10:42.412 --> 11:00.951
I think that Bradley Martin belonged to a very definite class of collectors of whom Mr. Houghton is another, for whom the act of collecting was almost more than the possession.

11:02.292 --> 11:11.862
And I don't think until quite recent, and I don't think until, you know, only about a dozen years ago when he got this house down in Virginia.

11:12.415 --> 11:22.370
I don't think that he had really sort of thought of his collection other than a lovely thing to have.

11:23.431 --> 11:34.608
And I think that the moving of all the Byrd books down to Virginia was probably the first sort of time he'd ever sat and thought about his collection in bulk.

11:36.851 --> 11:41.578
And, well, anyway, I'm sure he thought about it.

11:42.335 --> 11:50.347
Well, you say he is, you suspect that he is one of these collectors to whom the acquisition is more important than the possession.

11:50.367 --> 11:52.049
Well, not the acquisition.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.233
The hunt, the exercise.

11:54.253 --> 12:03.286
Yes, I mean, Arthur Houghton... But Houghton did start a library, on the other hand.

12:03.306 --> 12:07.112
Well, I mean, he and I were a library, but his books went elsewhere.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.355
Arthur...

12:09.993 --> 12:14.638
loved the atmosphere in the old Rosenbach, later Fleming shop.

12:15.078 --> 12:30.253
And dropping by on his way back from the office to talk, maybe buy a book, meet some people, was a part of his life, which he very much valued and loved and liked.

12:30.933 --> 12:37.840
And when he got old and a lot of the people who had been part of that circle died,

12:38.495 --> 12:40.397
It didn't seem so much fun anymore.

12:40.417 --> 12:48.564
And I know from talking to him that he sold his books because there wasn't anybody to talk to about them anymore.

12:48.584 --> 12:49.405
Isn't that amazing?

12:49.685 --> 12:50.586
I know you want to run.

12:50.646 --> 12:53.408
Could you give me the... No, no, no, I'm not running.

12:53.609 --> 12:56.912
I mean, it's only quarter past one.

12:57.272 --> 12:58.893
It's another 15 minutes.

12:58.913 --> 13:01.816
15 minutes would be very generous.

13:02.357 --> 13:06.240
Could you give me the names of some people in England who you would recommend I see?

13:07.148 --> 13:09.030
when I come over early next year.

13:09.190 --> 13:11.892
Direct me so I can do some background.

13:11.952 --> 13:23.903
See, this is such a wonderful opportunity for me of getting this background, the preliminaries done.

13:23.923 --> 13:27.386
On both the institutional and the private levels.

13:28.967 --> 13:35.653
Well, you see, yes, go and talk to

13:36.460 --> 13:37.381
Fred Ratliff.

13:38.342 --> 13:41.066
Frederick Ratliff.

13:41.086 --> 13:47.094
At the Cambridge University Library.

13:47.114 --> 13:52.741
Among institutional librarians.

13:52.761 --> 13:56.826
And go and talk to Anthony Rotter, who's a book dealer.

13:56.846 --> 13:57.968
Harry Scrolls, what I say?

13:57.988 --> 13:58.629
R-O-T-A.

13:59.530 --> 14:05.638
The firm's name is Bertram Rotter.

14:05.658 --> 14:05.978
Um...

14:07.375 --> 14:10.499
I connected with Nicholas Poole Wilson last week at Southerby's.

14:10.979 --> 14:11.540
Yes.

14:11.560 --> 14:24.155
Well, of course, Quaritch is a very big general firm with a large number of customers in all sorts of walks of life.

14:24.175 --> 14:34.547
And you would pick up more from talking to the staff of Quaritch's about who's buying what, where in the world than anybody else now.

14:36.535 --> 14:41.741
They are said to have bought the Cervantes were a Spanish collector, by the way.

14:41.761 --> 14:43.262
They spent $1.5 million.

14:43.362 --> 14:45.385
It was expected to get $300,000.

14:46.025 --> 14:46.626
Extraordinary.

14:47.187 --> 14:51.792
I'm sorry.

14:57.057 --> 15:02.323
I'm not sure that there's...

15:03.687 --> 15:07.271
That'll get me going.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.232
Yes, we'll get you going.

15:08.632 --> 15:09.153
Okay.

15:13.317 --> 15:16.100
How about any general views on these?

15:17.562 --> 15:22.967
You mentioned how your publication brings everyone together, booksellers, book buyers, collectors, librarians.

15:23.608 --> 15:25.070
How about is there any quality?

15:25.430 --> 15:30.756
I mean, book collecting is something that you can trace back centuries.

15:31.136 --> 15:32.057
Is there anything

15:32.257 --> 15:44.511
that you see in terms of a personality trait that is consistent what is it that makes a person that drives a person to go out and spend god knows uh hundreds of dollars

15:45.622 --> 15:46.844
What is it?

15:46.864 --> 15:48.866
Do you have an answer for that?

15:48.886 --> 15:55.355
Well, I mean, the amount of money is completely irrelevant.

15:55.795 --> 16:00.101
I mean, it's one way of dividing up the human race.

16:00.261 --> 16:09.773
Those who read and those who don't read and those who read tend to accumulate books of all sorts.

16:10.445 --> 16:18.515
The accumulation of books is an activity that grows on geometric progression.

16:18.535 --> 16:21.338
The more you have, the faster they come in.

16:22.920 --> 16:29.628
You mentioned in your preface to the garden catalogue that no apology is needed, which is an interesting line.

16:30.389 --> 16:35.895
Well... Apology, I beg your pardon, but there's a difference, I guess.

16:37.681 --> 16:43.427
I don't know that any apology was offered either.

16:43.968 --> 16:45.369
Not by or more in any case.

16:45.389 --> 16:47.412
Not by or more in any case.

16:47.492 --> 16:50.315
At least in England, whatever it was, it was an apology.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.599
Sir, I'll be done in about two minutes.

16:53.759 --> 16:59.465
No, I can't do that.

17:01.427 --> 17:05.832
There's any...

17:06.554 --> 17:08.917
Do you think it was a case of cashing in?

17:08.997 --> 17:09.978
How do you feel about that?

17:09.998 --> 17:12.281
I haven't remissed that yet.

17:12.301 --> 17:14.424
But we're not even talking about the Gardner collection.

17:14.604 --> 17:17.928
It's in general about collecting as investments.

17:18.348 --> 17:28.201
Well, the only thing I will say, I think that books are the very last thing that anybody ever spends money on with intent to see the money back.

17:28.761 --> 17:33.507
This might be an exception, however, to go from the general to the specific.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.825
I absolutely don't know the answer to that question.

17:38.185 --> 17:42.872
But I don't believe it to be true by the account of either party.

17:43.633 --> 17:49.202
I don't believe that Mr. Davis... I mean, look at Mr. Davis.

17:49.302 --> 18:01.620
I mean, if Mr. Davis had been a simple investor wishing to sink a large sum of money in books with intent to make a profit on it,

18:01.921 --> 18:03.503
He wouldn't have gone near Haven O' Moor.

18:03.543 --> 18:12.114
He would have gone to a trustworthy bookseller or put himself in the hands of Sotheby's or something.

18:12.134 --> 18:18.963
Except you hear the talk in the underground that Haven O' Moorhead is a small guy, if I call him.

18:19.343 --> 18:22.007
But then that proves my point, doesn't it?

18:22.327 --> 18:30.898
That whatever influence induced Mr. Davis to put money into these books, it wasn't a pure desire to invest.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.424
A quick question.

18:33.524 --> 18:45.715
One other area I wish to explore is the alleged indiscriminate spending of certain institutions, such as the University of Texas during the 60s.

18:46.716 --> 18:48.057
Any comments on that?

18:48.077 --> 18:50.739
Roger started, for instance, at Harvard things.

18:50.819 --> 18:54.402
He said, I think that there's nothing indiscriminate at all about that.

18:54.422 --> 19:00.868
He said, I think that's just a case of other institutions being jealous because they acquired so many wonderful things.

19:01.422 --> 19:18.602
No, I mean, Ransom's own pronouncements on this are absolutely unequivocal, that the money was there, the material was there, and there was more than enough money to buy up all the material within sight.

19:21.045 --> 19:29.455
The crucial factor in the situation was that unless it was bought up quickly, it would disappear.

19:30.042 --> 19:43.122
So Ransom said, don't count the cost, don't worry about duplication, but we've only got 10 years to do all this before something catches up.

19:43.162 --> 19:43.984
He was quite right.

19:44.364 --> 19:49.452
In fact, that goes back to what you said earlier before we started, is that this wall is right.

19:49.803 --> 19:52.346
There's no more money on the institutional level.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.228
So they should be very thrilled to have what they had.

19:54.248 --> 19:56.091
They should be very thrilled with what they got.

19:56.131 --> 19:57.652
I mean, exactly.

19:57.793 --> 20:00.936
So you think that his position then has been vindicated?

20:01.197 --> 20:02.258
Oh, very much so, yes.

20:02.278 --> 20:04.200
And he has a wonderful collection to do.

20:04.220 --> 20:07.524
There is a staggering collection which they'll go on exploring for centuries.

20:07.704 --> 20:15.714
I mean, I've heard it said that they spent half a million dollars for Graham Greene's toilet tissue, I mean, which is obviously an exaggeration.

20:15.754 --> 20:19.118
But they did spend big money for, apparently,

20:20.009 --> 20:23.154
I don't think so, ever.

20:23.734 --> 20:23.995
Really?

20:24.656 --> 20:25.838
No, I don't think so.

20:25.878 --> 20:43.083
I think they certainly paid big money for things, and I dare say some of the things that they bought when they got them didn't on inspection measure up quite to expectation.

20:43.904 --> 20:49.392
But I don't believe that on one single occasion did the University of Texas

20:49.878 --> 21:02.317
spend a sum of money that wasn't within reasonable proportions the value of the goods that they bought.

21:02.337 --> 21:18.822
I mean, when Siegfried Sassoon's library with all his manuscripts were sold, they went to that sale and they bid everybody out of sight, so that out of three or four hundred lots, only six went

21:19.274 --> 21:21.897
didn't go to the University of Texas.

21:21.917 --> 21:27.244
But, and they paid more money than anybody thought the books were going to fetch.

21:28.225 --> 21:46.227
But they bought it against real opposition, and real opposition isn't going to... I mean, in book sales, it's not the price that the buyer buys that counts, it's the price that the underbuyer drops out at, which is critical.

21:46.848 --> 21:50.593
Because you never find out how much the buyer would have been prepared to pay.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.537
He might have been prepared to pay double or treble what he ended up paying.

21:54.498 --> 22:05.554
So that if you regard the underbidder in that sale as being the truer index of the value than what Texas paid, you can see that they weren't paying.

22:05.574 --> 22:11.742
They may have been paying a lot more than they expected, but they weren't paying

22:12.177 --> 22:15.261
a wild uncontrolled fund.

22:15.281 --> 22:19.205
They were paying an increment higher than another person was willing to spend.

22:19.325 --> 22:19.866
That's right.

22:20.046 --> 22:33.702
And the existence of the underbidders is, if you follow me, a control on the figure that they ended up spending.

22:33.742 --> 22:36.666
And I think that was true of everything that they bought, you know.

22:37.086 --> 22:38.087
That is excellent.

22:38.728 --> 22:39.148
Good, good.

22:39.168 --> 22:40.270
I'm going to wrap up on that.

22:40.410 --> 22:41.391
Right.

22:42.181 --> 23:01.658
This is a very nice man, if you want to get involved in this, and it seems to me a particularly good story, called Donald Dickinson, who is at the School of Library Service at the University of Arizona, who has written a book, which I hope somebody will publish, on...

23:02.077 --> 23:29.805
uh the story of huntington's collection and in particular he's one of my champions and uh he knows more about it than anybody else the gentleman's name once again donald i think c dickinson certainly donald dickinson donald c dickinson at the university of arizona yeah and um and yes very much

23:30.460 --> 23:31.523
That's excellent.

23:31.543 --> 23:31.703
Yes.

23:31.883 --> 23:43.010
And I can't think of anybody else at the moment who's sort of working on a sort of specific history.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.536
Well, that's good for me.

23:46.578 --> 23:49.144
Well, I know, except that these books...

23:49.698 --> 23:55.026
You know, competition is rare, and even when it happens, it's often beneficial.

23:55.146 --> 24:00.915
Oh, I think it's... It pushes us to do better work and to get it done quickly.

24:00.935 --> 24:01.736
Well, all the very best.

24:01.917 --> 24:02.357
Thank you, sir.

24:02.377 --> 24:03.018
I'll be in touch.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.622
Thank you very much for your time.

24:06.283 --> 24:06.884
Let's start again.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.008
The difference between a rare book and a scarce book.

24:09.108 --> 24:12.733
First folio Shakespeare is not a scarce book.

24:12.753 --> 24:17.621
No, because there are 150 or so other rare books.

24:17.641 --> 24:17.781
Uh-huh.

24:18.773 --> 24:22.457
You can bring Bible the same, 40 copies.

24:22.477 --> 24:23.278
It's a rare book.

24:23.298 --> 24:26.062
But Tamerlane is a scarce book.

24:26.082 --> 24:26.522
And a rare book.

24:26.803 --> 24:27.744
And a rare book, both.

24:31.128 --> 24:32.770
But it's something you know when you see it.

24:32.790 --> 24:35.113
You can't give a difference.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.294
Well, it's rare.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.722
Well, my predecessor and...

24:43.900 --> 24:46.183
Lawrence Roth and William A. Jackson.

24:46.203 --> 24:52.753
What Bill Jackson did was go back and you'll see it in the second definition of rare in the OED.

24:52.893 --> 24:53.675
And what in the OED?

24:54.175 --> 25:01.907
The second definition of the word rare in the Oxford English Dictionary.

25:01.987 --> 25:07.215
Rarity implies a value in his consideration in rarity.

25:07.475 --> 25:08.076
Scarcity.

25:08.577 --> 25:11.241
It's statistical.

25:11.761 --> 25:12.542
Very interesting.

25:12.842 --> 25:18.230
The OED, of course, cites the first instance in the English language of Bibliomania to Dibdin.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.995
And reading Dibdin, I have Dibdin, he cites earlier.

25:22.015 --> 25:22.656
Oh, yeah.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.361
I think the word's been around a lot longer than the OED realizes.

25:26.381 --> 25:27.082
Oh, of course.

25:27.102 --> 25:35.233
Well, I think... Yeah, but they pride themselves in having the first known... Well, at the time, remember, that came early in the alphabet.

25:35.273 --> 25:35.854
Yeah, 1809.

25:35.934 --> 25:39.439
But that volume of the OED was early in the alphabet.

25:40.145 --> 25:43.931
So it was done in the 1880s or 60s.

25:43.971 --> 25:46.115
Whenever Murphy and Murray started.

25:46.976 --> 25:48.118
That's an interesting point.

25:48.418 --> 25:55.450
You know, when you use the OAD, you should always look at the date of the publication of that book, because it went over such a long period of time.

25:56.732 --> 25:57.453
That's a good point.

25:57.994 --> 26:05.646
But just going to Dibdin himself, I mean, I've just been... What Dibdin did was create the modern concept.

26:06.993 --> 26:15.926
of book collecting as a fashionable, grandiose kind of thing to do.

26:19.350 --> 26:23.637
Because he addressed the book to Richard Heber, who already had 300,000 books.

26:23.657 --> 26:25.980
Yeah, but it all came out of the Roxburgh Club.

26:26.481 --> 26:29.625
And the creation of the Roxburgh Club.

26:29.842 --> 26:32.264
which was the granddaddy of them all.

26:32.785 --> 26:34.907
It was his member, by the way.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.127
Oh, sure.

26:35.247 --> 26:37.189
What does he collect, by the way, in Washington?

26:37.209 --> 26:39.151
I'm going to shut this up.

26:39.171 --> 26:55.427
The last gentleman who just spoke was Tom Adams, director emeritus of the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, which is a major source for what I'm writing about.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.330
So that's another good hit.

26:58.664 --> 27:01.548
Today, by the way, is November 15th, 1989.

27:01.888 --> 27:09.139
This is tape two of the Marker presentation.

27:09.159 --> 27:09.699
Oh, wonderful.

27:12.623 --> 27:24.380
When Cummins, when the bidding on the Shakespeare's kind of stalled at 185, and he said, think about it.

27:24.400 --> 27:24.520
Right.

27:24.820 --> 27:27.463
And then I asked Dick what he was thinking about at that moment.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.026
And it wasn't a question of the dome, by the way.

27:30.767 --> 27:37.576
Apparently he had access, he had an opportunity to get another Shakespeare, but was this one a great one?

27:37.796 --> 27:44.104
And he concluded that it was, and confidentially, that at twice the price it was a bargain.

27:44.124 --> 27:45.726
Well, that might be me.

27:45.746 --> 27:47.368
I've heard that one many times.

27:47.388 --> 27:48.049
I love that song.

27:48.609 --> 27:53.275
But I think more likely what happened was that he had a pre-determined price he was going to.

27:53.727 --> 27:56.030
And we got past that.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.252
That's why I said things about it.

27:58.272 --> 28:06.181
He also told me, and I have it in the piece I'm writing for Maine Antiques Digest, is that he came to get the Chivantes and the Book of Daniel, too.

28:06.201 --> 28:14.370
And I guess he said he was underbidder on the Daniel, which is what, what did that go for, 600 or some such thing?

28:14.410 --> 28:16.012
The Chivantes, of course, went crazy.

28:16.212 --> 28:18.755
They went for a buck and a half.

28:18.915 --> 28:19.756
So he came to play.

28:19.836 --> 28:21.058
He came to play ball that day.

28:21.078 --> 28:21.338
Yeah, he did.

28:21.588 --> 28:23.109
What was my question?

28:23.129 --> 28:24.571
He's a wonderful bidder.

28:24.591 --> 28:26.753
Well, Cummins does is, did Cummins nod?

28:27.834 --> 28:28.735
I didn't see it.

28:28.835 --> 28:29.455
Yeah, yeah.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.216
I said he nodded.

28:30.536 --> 28:34.660
I said in my piece, and this is just a small item, but I knew who was bidding.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.502
Yeah.

28:36.522 --> 28:38.023
Some of these you don't even say.

28:38.063 --> 28:43.768
I mean, I kept very careful, very careful records of the sale.

28:44.509 --> 28:47.151
And for most, here's the piece.

28:47.171 --> 28:48.593
You can take this one.

28:48.613 --> 28:49.093
No, thanks.

28:49.874 --> 28:51.055
That's, yeah.

28:51.642 --> 29:18.780
uh as you can see i kept very careful records now i've got like krause you said krause on the first lot right uh others went by numbers after a while we could figure that quaritch was 157. some of you don't say any at all how do we know who that is how do you uh well let me see well this is my notes yeah a question mark for instance not that i care to know it that it's quite irrelevant maybe an order bit no that's probably what it is i had a bit i had a lot of bits in the book

29:19.283 --> 29:19.764
Yeah.

29:19.784 --> 29:20.204
Order bid.

29:20.284 --> 29:21.626
People send you a written commission.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.709
And then when I get that, I don't call those names out generally.

29:24.749 --> 29:31.717
I would put the button off, the speaker off, and just say, you know, Nick bought that one or something.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.099
I'm a collector, by the way.

29:33.659 --> 29:39.105
You'll see in this piece, by the way, and this is something that you, believe me, this is useful.

29:39.726 --> 29:45.112
Because you'll see in my piece, Dick Manny, for instance, rushed from New York to the Boston Book Fair.

29:45.693 --> 29:48.036
Which is, you know, I prowl these things.

29:48.256 --> 29:48.396
Mm-hmm.

29:48.832 --> 29:56.059
You know, you go looking for a $0.25 deal, but, you know, a wonderful find, $2.05.

29:56.719 --> 30:04.987
But that's the beauty, I think, of going to auctions, of any kind of collecting pursuit, is that you can... Well, we had that poem book last year.

30:06.348 --> 30:08.830
Well, I... To cut that, too, by the way.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.133
You mentioned in the book that it was a commercial fisherman.

30:12.634 --> 30:13.955
Yeah.

30:13.975 --> 30:16.958
Is this guy really committed to anonymity, do you think?

30:16.978 --> 30:18.079
Do you think he'd talk for...

30:18.447 --> 30:22.012
Talk to somebody about his collecting for a work in progress?

30:23.013 --> 30:23.774
It's possible.

30:24.214 --> 30:25.136
I mean, we could try.

30:25.236 --> 30:27.018
It was up here someplace, you know.

30:27.479 --> 30:28.961
He came into our office in Boston.

30:28.981 --> 30:29.942
In Boston, I know that.

30:30.042 --> 30:31.163
Yeah.

30:31.203 --> 30:35.709
That's a very interesting... I'll send you some stuff if you like that I've written.

30:35.729 --> 30:38.633
I'll tell you what you can do is ask Pat Ward, who runs our office here.

30:38.984 --> 30:40.367
I don't really know.

30:40.688 --> 30:42.712
I don't want to embarrass anybody.

30:42.732 --> 30:46.059
I mean, it's a perfectly normal request that either the person can do it or not.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.906
I'd love to talk to this guy because obviously he's a collector.

30:49.507 --> 30:50.930
We all collect at different levels.

30:51.030 --> 30:55.440
And I've asked myself, if I got the camera lame, would I keep it?
