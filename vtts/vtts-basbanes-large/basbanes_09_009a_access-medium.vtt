WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:04.174
Here's the hat from John Mortimer.

00:04.735 --> 00:04.955
Oh!

00:05.275 --> 00:06.517
Just don't even mind it.

00:06.577 --> 00:07.038
It's there.

00:07.939 --> 00:08.720
Looks very nice.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.062
Very neat.

00:10.262 --> 00:11.263
Small, isn't it?

00:11.283 --> 00:11.383
Yeah.

00:11.624 --> 00:12.865
I'm going to loosen my tie.

00:13.626 --> 00:15.569
So tell me, have you been watching the O.J.

00:15.609 --> 00:16.390
Simpson trial?

00:16.410 --> 00:17.031
Oh, I have.

00:18.193 --> 00:19.394
Are there any parallels?

00:19.534 --> 00:21.257
You talk about embracing murderers.

00:22.378 --> 00:26.684
I'm not asking you to judge the case, but I think you have your friends.

00:26.904 --> 00:32.772
What it proves to me is that it's absolutely fatal to allow television cameras into courtrooms.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.976
which we don't allow in England.

00:36.996 --> 00:41.121
I think it's the most terrible thing for many reasons.

00:41.341 --> 00:44.804
I mean, I think it's not a trial anymore.

00:44.985 --> 00:48.909
It's a sort of mass entertainment.

00:48.949 --> 00:53.193
But I mean, it's being watched in your country as well, isn't it?

00:53.213 --> 00:54.014
Well, not much.

00:55.235 --> 00:59.220
I think there are bits you can see.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.484
I read someplace where they're showing a couple hours of it live at night.

01:04.055 --> 01:04.936
Oh, yeah.

01:05.556 --> 01:06.357
I don't know what, yes.

01:07.298 --> 01:09.601
But it just seems, I mean, I think it's awful.

01:09.621 --> 01:14.125
I mean, I think for lots and lots of reasons.

01:14.145 --> 01:24.095
I mean, I think it's bad to be tried anyway, but to be tried in front of 18 minutes, you know, it's like being tried in a sports arena by Castro or something.

01:24.175 --> 01:29.100
And also, if you're talking to a jury, it's quite an intimate affair.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.788
occasion in a way, and if they're going to come back and give a verdict before all these millions of people, it must affect what they do.

01:38.509 --> 01:41.692
But it certainly does make them more accountable, wouldn't you think?

01:42.192 --> 01:42.713
One would hope.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.855
Well, wrongly accountable, I think.

01:45.095 --> 01:52.203
And I think it makes them much more conscious of mass public opinion, which they shouldn't be.

01:52.223 --> 01:54.505
I mean, there is a racial division, as you know.

01:54.846 --> 01:55.206
Yes.

01:56.427 --> 01:57.248
I know, but...

01:58.780 --> 02:08.591
And I think that the people who are behaving, if they're ever performing on television, I mean, the judge is behaving so... But he's allowing all these bench cards.

02:08.611 --> 02:10.453
Well, he's relying on ridiculous things.

02:10.974 --> 02:11.375
I don't know.

02:11.475 --> 02:13.637
It seems to me like not a trial at all.

02:13.657 --> 02:23.469
The other thing I think is terribly unhealthy is, you know, sort of 90% of the population not doing anything except sitting watching television.

02:23.489 --> 02:27.353
And 10% of the people have to go out and do the murders and fall in love with each other's mothers.

02:27.839 --> 02:33.406
to have the activity shooting channel in order to inform the rest of the population.

02:33.466 --> 02:36.290
Well, let's... It's a nation of voyeurs.

02:37.131 --> 02:40.735
Let's send you to the book again.

02:42.117 --> 02:46.262
You wrote an autobiographical work 13 or so years ago.

02:46.282 --> 02:46.503
Yeah.

02:46.883 --> 02:47.984
Bringing to the record, yeah.

02:48.966 --> 02:55.534
And tell me why you saw the need to...

02:56.003 --> 02:58.307
Resume the trail.

02:59.408 --> 03:03.534
Well, that finished 20 years ago, but this isn't really an autobiography.

03:04.516 --> 03:09.664
It's just a book really about people passing through.

03:09.784 --> 03:11.186
It's really a book about other people.

03:11.206 --> 03:12.007
It's an memoir.

03:12.849 --> 03:15.433
It's more of a memoir, you would say?

03:15.453 --> 03:16.594
I'm not quite sure.

03:16.614 --> 03:24.306
It's really a book about the people that passed through my life and what I thought of them and what I made of them, I suppose.

03:25.028 --> 03:39.186
It isn't meant to be a... because I think the last 20 years of your life are difficult to make into a dramatic story, because you've probably arrived at what point you're going to arrive at, and that's that.

03:39.646 --> 03:47.276
So really it's a book about the people that passed by, and the murderers and the friends.

03:47.476 --> 03:54.445
Would you have expected the last 20 years, I guess you're about 73 now, would you, I guess...

03:54.745 --> 03:55.847
Yeah, yeah.

03:56.107 --> 03:58.650
Based on mathematics and reading here.

03:58.670 --> 03:58.871
Yeah.

04:00.894 --> 04:03.697
Has it been an eventful 20 years for you?

04:05.961 --> 04:06.822
Well, I suppose so.

04:06.962 --> 04:21.462
I mean, it's been rather like... I mean, it's been quite like all my life, but it's... except that it's been... In a way, I think old age is a happier period, because you don't have to worry.

04:23.703 --> 04:29.109
You don't have to worry about making it or probably you've got enough money for us until you die.

04:30.050 --> 04:32.993
And also you don't mind particularly what you say.

04:33.033 --> 04:38.979
You don't have to please anybody or be polite or anything like that.

04:38.999 --> 04:41.822
So I think in a way it's quite a happy turn.

04:42.322 --> 04:52.933
Do you find that the creative juices are flowing as strongly as they were at the height of your activity, your creative activity?

04:53.673 --> 04:55.916
Well, that's difficult for me to say.

04:56.276 --> 05:00.140
I think I certainly write as much as I ever wrote.

05:01.662 --> 05:07.388
Perhaps you don't have... Perhaps the ideas aren't as new as they were.

05:07.789 --> 05:10.031
Perhaps that might be true.

05:12.034 --> 05:20.423
But I think... I really think... I mean, Muriel Sparks said that, you know, when you're young, it's the time to sleep a lot and make love and not work very hard.

05:20.943 --> 05:25.149
When you're old, there's nothing else to do but work really hard.

05:25.169 --> 05:26.491
It's the best time.

05:26.511 --> 05:28.073
Best time for production, yes.

05:28.574 --> 05:32.519
Now, you became a full-time writer at 63, I guess.

05:32.739 --> 05:33.500
No, not at all.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.363
I was a full-time writer all my life.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.687
But you gave up the law then, shall we say.

05:38.707 --> 05:39.789
Yes, I gave up the law.

05:39.909 --> 05:44.676
But giving up the law didn't make much effect to one way or another to my writing.

05:45.837 --> 05:48.701
I wrote all the time as I was a lawyer.

05:48.721 --> 05:49.262
And...

05:50.795 --> 05:57.243
I didn't really, well, I suppose I read, no, I didn't really, I don't think it really made any difference.

05:57.263 --> 06:07.456
I mean, the sort of lawyer that I was, I didn't work in an office or have a partner or have a boss or anything like that, so I could do it.

06:07.536 --> 06:14.305
I know that towards the last ten years, I used to do about five cases a year, five big cases.

06:15.867 --> 06:19.131
So, I don't think it made any difference to the other than I read.

06:22.486 --> 06:31.594
but you do consider yourself then as having been your primary occupation, your primary profession, that was, was writing.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.495
Exactly.

06:32.955 --> 06:35.817
And law was my sort of waitressing.

06:35.837 --> 06:40.502
You know, like girls who want to be film stars, get jobs in restaurants, etc.

06:40.962 --> 06:42.483
Did you use it as source material?

06:42.603 --> 06:48.068
Oh, yeah, well... I mean, as a flyer for the... Well, yes, certainly.

06:48.088 --> 06:51.531
I mean, I certainly wouldn't have been able to write what I wrote unless I'd been a lawyer.

06:52.085 --> 06:56.712
And also, I think it's a wonderful thing to have a job which gets you into touch with people.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.195
A crisis over their lives.

07:00.818 --> 07:08.249
Find out how people react to all sorts of strange things.

07:08.269 --> 07:10.172
Life, love and death.

07:10.192 --> 07:14.979
So it was very useful from that point of view.

07:16.661 --> 07:20.607
And of course I couldn't have written Rumpel unless I'd been a criminal.

07:21.886 --> 07:26.232
Tell us, you know what, there's been all kinds of speculation on one fall.

07:26.252 --> 07:27.493
Is he a wealth of ego?

07:27.513 --> 07:30.638
Is he a composite of people?

07:30.678 --> 07:33.121
Is he a total invention?

07:33.141 --> 07:35.524
Tell me a little bit about it if you like that.

07:35.544 --> 07:39.269
Well, I mean, I thought I wanted a character to keep me alive in my old age.

07:40.310 --> 07:47.640
I thought I needed a detective like Sherlock Holmes or Mary Gray or something like that.

07:48.380 --> 08:00.435
I thought that I'd have an Earl Bailey barrister for sort of, sort of detective in a way, although he wouldn't go out and look for clues, but he would solve mysteries.

08:00.455 --> 08:05.141
And then I thought I'd have this barrister figure.

08:06.062 --> 08:08.525
And he was in a marvel of my father.

08:08.545 --> 08:13.991
He wore Rumpel's uniform, black jacket and striped trousers.

08:14.011 --> 08:16.935
He'd now last down the waistcoat.

08:19.126 --> 08:22.070
And a lot of barristers I mess down at the El Gravy.

08:22.691 --> 08:26.376
Barristers who called me a judge I'll darling all the time.

08:26.496 --> 08:28.800
Never called their wives though, darling.

08:29.100 --> 08:42.138
And a bit of me, a lot of me really, because he says what I say, what I think, and if I say it, it sounds sort of trendy and left-wing, and as he says it, it sounds very crusty.

08:42.158 --> 08:44.121
Acceptable.

08:44.141 --> 08:46.204
So that was really how he came about.

08:46.284 --> 08:48.407
And I wrote one play

08:48.826 --> 08:51.589
I'd run to a play to start with.

08:52.590 --> 09:00.359
And then from that, there he was about it.

09:00.379 --> 09:04.003
It was a little round of play, by the way.

09:04.023 --> 09:06.966
So really he was an invention then?

09:07.667 --> 09:08.628
Oh yes, yes.

09:09.870 --> 09:15.576
But back old inventions, he has a lot of other people, a mixture of people.

09:16.130 --> 09:30.346
I think it's more than just the coincidence of you having been a lawyer where you decided to write largely about the law.

09:30.567 --> 09:39.657
Certainly, you know, you've written other things, but you point out that along with literature, law is something that the English

09:40.379 --> 09:45.287
has contributed to Western culture or whatever.

09:45.507 --> 09:57.826
Well, yes, I mean, I think our joint legal system is the best in the world, really, and our child system is very good, very fair.

09:57.846 --> 09:58.427
Yes, I do.

09:58.527 --> 10:05.678
I think we should be proud of the legal system and English literature and the great British breakfast system.

10:08.071 --> 10:10.995
But we share the same legal system, really.

10:11.055 --> 10:11.796
Of course.

10:11.816 --> 10:13.478
And it works very well.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.723
I mean, they cite English common law here, I think.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.226
Yes, exactly.

10:21.169 --> 10:25.474
How do you... How do you want people to view your way?

10:25.655 --> 10:29.660
I mean, is it meant... Who's your audience?

10:30.721 --> 10:32.764
I honestly don't... Me.

10:32.784 --> 10:37.150
You see, I'm sort of... I mean, I don't think I think of an audience.

10:37.940 --> 10:46.809
I think I try to entertain myself, and if I entertain myself, then I hope that other people will share in that.

10:47.830 --> 10:52.555
I don't think you can write... I don't think you can think of an audience when you write.

10:55.658 --> 11:02.765
But then, on the other hand, when I go to these places, you know, I get a very big audience, people come and listen.

11:02.886 --> 11:05.348
So there is a big audience.

11:06.239 --> 11:17.430
Honestly, if I'm sitting writing, I have no consciousness of an audience.

11:17.490 --> 11:19.431
I think I can entertain myself.

11:19.732 --> 11:22.514
And if I can make myself laugh, then I know it's all right.

11:23.335 --> 11:28.280
And if I'm bored, I know it's absolutely no bloody good whatsoever.

11:28.300 --> 11:36.027
So I think really, it's like performing, of course you, of course,

11:37.255 --> 11:51.012
Of course you have to entertain an audience, but I think what you think of doing when you're writing is entertaining yourself, and then, with any luck, you're like the people who get to read the book.

11:51.152 --> 11:56.519
Is the primary function entertainment, in your view?

11:58.281 --> 12:03.507
It's not the only function, but I think unless you can entertain people, you've got to shut up.

12:04.389 --> 12:07.212
I think if you're not entertaining,

12:07.715 --> 12:18.386
I mean, King Lear is entertainment, Hamlet is entertainment, Madame Beauvoir is entertainment.

12:18.406 --> 12:29.839
I mean, Matisse, a revolutionary poet, said that people lead very hard lives when they work hard.

12:29.879 --> 12:36.726
When they come home, what they want to do is to be given pleasure by painting or by... And I think that's

12:37.313 --> 12:42.319
Unless you do that, then I think you're not fulfilling any function at all.

12:42.920 --> 12:58.398
But during the course of entertaining people, I think you should try and have some... give them some feeling of sympathy for each other or understanding of each other or understanding of the human situation.

13:03.084 --> 13:06.628
But without entertaining people, I don't think you can...

13:06.845 --> 13:09.848
trespass on their time.

13:09.868 --> 13:12.090
You can say, people come and be bored with me.

13:14.433 --> 13:19.097
So everything has to be, it always has to be new for you every time long.

13:20.278 --> 13:20.699
Yes.

13:21.019 --> 13:25.043
You try not to, you certainly don't ever try to repeat yourself.

13:25.343 --> 13:35.113
Well, try not to, although of course any writer has a personality, and you're always writing with that personality.

13:35.363 --> 13:46.680
No, I think you should try and entertain them, try and surprise them, keep them wondering what's going to happen next, which is terribly important in writing fiction.

13:46.821 --> 13:57.597
I think unless you want to turn over the page and discover what's going to happen, you're not led through a book.

13:58.619 --> 14:03.987
And that's quite unfashionable, because a lot of fashionable novels don't have any stories to them at all.

14:04.760 --> 14:19.335
I did an interview with Nadine Broadway some months back when she was here in Cambridge, and she said that she feels that every one of her books is almost the same story, but from a different view, like walking around.

14:20.817 --> 14:30.447
She doesn't mean for it to be this way, but it's like when you think you've told the story, you walk around and you look at it from a different angle, and here it comes again.

14:30.467 --> 14:34.311
And I guess what she was saying is that she saw her body of work as a corpus,

14:34.848 --> 14:42.374
Do you feel that your work constitutes a corpus of work?

14:42.815 --> 14:46.058
Well, I think it's bound to, if it all comes from you.

14:46.478 --> 14:52.343
And I think the first thing, the first requirement of a writer is they should not write like anybody else.

14:53.464 --> 15:04.213
I mean, if you write something that could be written by anyone else, then you might as well give it up, because what you've got to do is to find the thing inside yourself that is different.

15:06.505 --> 15:11.330
That being so, then everything you write must have that personality.

15:14.574 --> 15:15.575
Certainly.

15:15.595 --> 15:20.441
So that gives us, that does give us a homogeneity, I'm sure.

15:20.461 --> 15:28.750
I mean, every book by Dickens is like a book by Dickens, it isn't like a book by Tromach or Zachary.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.994
So in that sense, it is, yes.

15:33.796 --> 15:34.977
Like your children were all

15:36.104 --> 15:42.753
I knew that you had done Brideshead Revisit, which was outstanding.

15:42.873 --> 15:43.334
Yes.

15:43.354 --> 15:45.237
It's still, I mean, it's still playing.

15:45.337 --> 15:46.358
Yes, it is.

15:46.939 --> 15:48.982
I didn't realize that you'd worked on I Claudius.

15:50.243 --> 15:52.026
Well, not the television I Claudius.

15:52.106 --> 15:54.189
I read a play I Claudius.

15:54.289 --> 15:54.710
Oh, you did?

15:54.730 --> 15:54.930
Okay.

15:54.950 --> 15:55.871
A theater play, yes.

15:55.891 --> 15:57.774
Okay.

15:57.794 --> 16:01.799
But how is that for you, dealing with somebody else's work?

16:01.839 --> 16:05.925
Well, it's quite different, really, because

16:06.732 --> 16:12.779
I guess it's an obligation to be faithful to a degree... It's rather like defending somebody in the dark, you know.

16:12.799 --> 16:20.367
You're representing every war, so therefore you've got to put their case as well as possible.

16:22.710 --> 16:31.880
But the difficult things about writing, like thinking of stories or thinking of a theme or thinking of characters, have all been done for you by somebody else.

16:31.900 --> 16:36.385
I think what impresses many of us is the ease

16:36.803 --> 16:41.247
the apparent ease with which you move from one form of writing to another.

16:41.267 --> 16:47.714
I mean, screenwriters here, people who were able to write things for television, make a hell of a lot of money.

16:47.734 --> 16:49.376
I mean, this is... And it's a skill.

16:49.456 --> 16:55.181
I mean, it's something that you just have to envy when you see it.

16:55.201 --> 17:00.106
How is it that you managed to move so... Well, I think it's all the same thing, really.

17:01.668 --> 17:06.793
I mean, I think that any piece of writing consists of a theme, a plot,

17:07.415 --> 17:11.521
characters, drama, suspense.

17:13.704 --> 17:14.686
And it's all the same.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.470
I mean, there are great differences.

17:18.491 --> 17:22.898
I mean, a novel can be told in all sorts of hundreds of different ways.

17:22.958 --> 17:28.947
A drama can basically only be told and done or seen.

17:30.169 --> 17:35.076
But the original impetus is really the same.

17:35.096 --> 17:35.717
I mean, I've done

17:36.507 --> 17:38.349
I mean, I did Boy's Land and My Father.

17:38.449 --> 17:40.532
It started me by being a radio play.

17:40.552 --> 17:42.434
It became a television play.

17:42.454 --> 17:43.715
It became a stage play.

17:43.735 --> 17:45.397
It became a film.

17:45.517 --> 17:55.289
I mean, I don't think it was particularly different in all those different disguises.

17:56.710 --> 17:59.494
I mean, I know how to write films because I worked in films.

17:59.514 --> 18:03.358
I know basically not very hard to

18:04.925 --> 18:06.748
to gather the techniques of these things.

18:06.768 --> 18:10.493
What is hard is thinking of something original to say.

18:11.374 --> 18:14.839
I didn't realize that you had done this as such a young man right after the war.

18:15.079 --> 18:21.188
Yeah, well, during the war, I was... But you came here, I think, after the war, didn't you?

18:21.208 --> 18:22.930
To hardly... Well, yes, I guess.

18:23.191 --> 18:26.515
I mean, I worked for an American film.

18:29.039 --> 18:30.641
Not very happily.

18:31.482 --> 18:34.206
But I don't think there's...

18:35.435 --> 18:37.198
I don't think there's all that amount of difference.

18:37.358 --> 18:41.104
I don't think there's a great technical secret about everything.

18:41.124 --> 18:43.448
So it's craft as much as anything else.

18:43.468 --> 18:44.089
Is that what you're saying?

18:46.072 --> 18:51.822
The difference is a craft, but the essential thing is something different.

18:52.803 --> 18:56.209
Inspiration, or whatever you call it.

18:56.229 --> 18:58.132
That's if you're doing your own original thing.

18:58.152 --> 19:01.898
I mean, if you're adapting things, that's just purely craft.

19:02.840 --> 19:12.333
I think one of the things that impressed us, and me, certainly, as Price has been, in having read the book immediately after he wrote, is how faithful you were.

19:12.733 --> 19:14.095
Yeah, well, I think you should be.

19:14.155 --> 19:24.509
I mean, I just did a version of Christmas Carol for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in London, which is terribly faithful to the book.

19:26.072 --> 19:32.340
I mean, the real problem with adapting novels for drama is that you lose the author,

19:32.945 --> 19:38.493
The best part of Dickens, the best part of the Evening War, really, is the author talking.

19:38.513 --> 19:45.724
And so in Christmas Carol, all the characters on the stage said all the lines of the book.

19:45.744 --> 19:53.775
And in Brad's head, you know, there's a narrator who says the Evening War and Evening War says.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.482
So I think that's the difficult thing to keep.

19:58.502 --> 20:00.285
But I don't think adapting anything is...

20:01.193 --> 20:06.341
is the same as an original act of creation.

20:07.182 --> 20:10.827
You've also written about the art of cross-examination in the fantasy.

20:11.088 --> 20:11.228
Yes.

20:12.009 --> 20:14.293
It's just so pertinent to what's going on here.

20:14.313 --> 20:15.174
Well, that's right.

20:16.476 --> 20:23.106
I mean, my cross-examinations were much ruder than Mr. Bailey's and Mr. Shapiro's.

20:23.146 --> 20:24.308
Did you see any of these, though?

20:24.408 --> 20:25.189
Yes, I've seen them.

20:25.229 --> 20:25.810
Yes, I have.

20:25.830 --> 20:28.534
Do you find that they are hypnotic in a way?

20:28.801 --> 20:33.648
Well, they're interesting for me because I'm used to chords.

20:33.668 --> 20:36.311
I find them quite undramatic, really.

20:36.352 --> 20:40.978
I mean, they seem to be so plodding and long.

20:42.300 --> 20:51.112
Well, while you've, having been a journalist who's covered a lot of trials, I find, you know, I have the temperament to sit through a trial.

20:51.132 --> 20:54.998
Yes, absolutely, so do I. I mean, I've sat, yes, exactly.

20:55.038 --> 20:57.040
And it doesn't matter how many hours it is.

20:57.060 --> 20:57.441
No.

20:57.893 --> 20:58.614
It's fascinating.

20:58.954 --> 21:00.136
Yes, yes, it is.

21:00.156 --> 21:01.398
It's a revelatory process.

21:01.458 --> 21:02.740
It's an unlayering, really.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.401
Yes.

21:03.761 --> 21:21.486
And I think one, you know, I just have to disagree with you slightly on whether or not it's a good idea to televise trials like this, because I have always maintained that you should never second-guess a jury, because a jury sees all the facts.

21:21.706 --> 21:22.007
Yes.

21:22.027 --> 21:25.251
And what we're seeing is just really a synopsis in the press

21:25.805 --> 21:28.008
or what some bonehead is saying on television.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.470
You know, how can you make a judgment?

21:30.731 --> 21:34.835
But here, you're not really seeing what the jury says, you're seeing more.

21:35.576 --> 21:41.303
I know, but then why, you know, what does that do for us, do for the president?

21:41.323 --> 21:42.264
I wonder, yeah.

21:43.745 --> 21:51.334
But then the public can, then the jury can say to themselves, well, these people know everything.

21:51.374 --> 21:52.976
How are we going to say the right things?

21:53.016 --> 21:53.837
They'll think we're right.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.664
I think it's quite dangerous, that.

21:59.145 --> 22:01.988
And they don't allow this at all in your country?

22:02.008 --> 22:08.456
Well, we don't have our television, of course, and all these people, these pundits would all be arrested and imprisoned for contempt, of course.

22:08.516 --> 22:09.317
For talking outside?

22:09.597 --> 22:11.459
Well, for talking, yes, for contempt, you know.

22:11.479 --> 22:14.463
And the press for these interminable press conferences.

22:14.483 --> 22:19.088
In return on everybody, you know, the jury manager, Tyler.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.950
Yeah, amazing.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.453
And then it seems to be terrible madness to me when they,

22:24.142 --> 22:30.891
You know, they discuss on television whether they should allow the evidence of him having battled previous while, whatever it was.

22:31.311 --> 22:34.515
And then they go into court and see whether that's submissive.

22:36.358 --> 22:42.506
Or doing that witness that made, videotaping her to show at a later time.

22:42.766 --> 22:43.067
Yes.

22:43.567 --> 22:45.229
Maybe not show it at a later time.

22:45.249 --> 22:46.010
Yes, I know.

22:46.171 --> 22:49.575
That was, that was, what could a jury be thinking for ten days?

22:49.943 --> 22:52.106
I know what all this is going on.

22:52.126 --> 22:54.009
What in the world is going on?

22:54.189 --> 22:55.170
Yeah, exactly.

22:55.190 --> 22:55.751
You wonder.

22:57.173 --> 22:59.116
But it is fascinating, of course.

22:59.136 --> 23:03.842
You know, I really haven't questioned you at all about the book, because it's... Well, you've got the book there.

23:03.862 --> 23:05.945
I have the book, and that's my job to read.

23:05.965 --> 23:07.007
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

23:07.487 --> 23:12.334
You know, and it is kind of nice to get a couple of live quotes, as they say.

23:13.175 --> 23:18.162
I did a piece a couple weeks ago on Kelman, the Booker Prize...

23:18.867 --> 23:19.948
Oh, yes.

23:20.189 --> 23:20.990
...recipient.

23:21.010 --> 23:24.495
Do you have any opinion on that huge controversy?

23:24.955 --> 23:26.858
What about the Booker Prize?

23:26.878 --> 23:31.444
The one that won the Booker, yeah, the fellow... I didn't, I'm afraid I haven't read it back now.

23:31.464 --> 23:36.250
...and use a certain four-letter word, you know, by one count, 4,000 times.

23:36.350 --> 23:37.292
Oh, I gotta see.

23:37.933 --> 23:44.301
But it's an interesting, interesting interview.

23:46.205 --> 23:48.168
Truly, I don't want to take up to what you're telling.

23:48.289 --> 23:50.372
I do have plenty of material on the book.

23:50.833 --> 23:51.254
Lovely.

23:51.274 --> 23:52.737
Well, it's been very nice to see you.

23:52.757 --> 23:54.520
I'm pleased to get it to half an hour.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.664
Lots of good quotes.

23:56.684 --> 23:57.064
Great.

23:57.325 --> 24:00.731
And I wonder if you'd kindly inscribe my copy of the book, however, would you?

24:00.991 --> 24:04.097
I certainly will.

24:04.137 --> 24:04.838
Okay.
