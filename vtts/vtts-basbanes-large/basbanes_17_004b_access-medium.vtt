00:04.520 --> 00:05.847
We're the Book Guys in Washington.

00:05.947 --> 00:07.897
I'm Mike Cuthbert, along with Alan Stipek.

00:07.978 --> 00:10.933
Our phone number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

00:10.953 --> 00:12.943
Call that number 24 hours a day.

00:13.244 --> 00:18.491
have with you your book, and with it, of course, the title, the author, the publisher, and the date.

00:18.872 --> 00:22.637
That'll help us track you down a little bit later and get you on the air.

00:22.957 --> 00:25.180
By the way, that's for our producer's information.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.927
Alan Steipek doesn't know when these calls come in what in the world you're going to be talking about.

00:29.967 --> 00:40.101
In fact, he's probably irritated that I already tipped off that our next caller from Maryland, Joel, has a set of presidential papers, because Alan doesn't want to know anything, but I apologize, Alan.

00:40.121 --> 00:41.563
Joel, welcome to the book, guys.

00:41.543 --> 00:42.545
Hi, Mike.

00:42.665 --> 00:43.005
Hi, Alan.

00:43.065 --> 00:44.207
Very, very interesting show.

00:44.227 --> 00:44.928
I'm enjoying this.

00:45.169 --> 00:46.210
Thank you.

00:46.751 --> 00:58.489
I've got here, I've got a 10-volume, it's called a compilation of the messages and papers of the president, 1789 to 1897.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.067
It was published in Washington by the government printing office, and it's dated 1897.

01:04.087 --> 01:07.712
And it's a 10-volume collection.

01:07.792 --> 01:12.739
It's in excellent condition, and I'm certainly interested to see what's worth this is.

01:12.759 --> 01:14.721
Okay, Joel, which binding do you have?

01:15.482 --> 01:22.232
Okay, it's not a question of what book do you have, but the messages and the papers of the presidents came in so many different bindings.

01:23.113 --> 01:25.175
Do you have the leather binding?

01:25.496 --> 01:25.957
Yes, I do.

01:26.157 --> 01:26.637
Which color?

01:27.058 --> 01:28.560
The black, blue, red, or green?

01:28.625 --> 01:30.167
It's red.

01:30.467 --> 01:30.667
Red.

01:31.048 --> 01:35.633
Is it the full leather, or is it the thin, like, pared down leather?

01:36.514 --> 01:37.755
You can tell if it's very plush.

01:37.815 --> 01:43.041
When you put your fingers on it, there's a kind of, you absorb into it, or is it very stiff?

01:43.061 --> 01:43.561
Very stiff.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.122
Very stiff.

01:44.482 --> 01:53.993
Okay, you have probably a set of books that we would sell in the store for, if we were lucky, $100, if the set was, in fact, in very good to fine condition.

01:54.013 --> 01:58.598
Those sets of the messages and papers tend to deteriorate overnight.

01:58.578 --> 02:01.703
I've been known to just look at them and see the boards fall off.

02:02.624 --> 02:12.039
It is not an uncommon set at all, and you will find it, especially in the Washington area, in almost every government office has had a set at one time or another.

02:12.780 --> 02:16.946
The best set I've ever seen is a very plush leather set which sells for about $250.

02:16.987 --> 02:20.552
And that's the messages and papers.

02:20.532 --> 02:21.834
Okay.

02:22.054 --> 02:22.334
Great.

02:22.354 --> 02:22.975
Thank you so much.

02:23.075 --> 02:24.136
Thank you very much, Joel.

02:24.236 --> 02:24.597
Take care.

02:24.857 --> 02:24.957
Okay.

02:24.977 --> 02:25.298
Bye-bye.

02:25.578 --> 02:29.223
When you talk about very good to find, what are you talking about?

02:29.323 --> 02:33.388
Well, the conditions of books are very important to anybody who collects.

02:33.668 --> 02:38.734
Booksellers should be very conservative in the way they define their books.

02:39.155 --> 02:43.900
A book is mint as new when it comes off the printing press.

02:43.940 --> 02:44.481
Mint means

02:44.461 --> 02:45.103
As new?

02:45.524 --> 02:47.108
Yeah, I would say mint means as new.

02:47.289 --> 02:51.942
Fine means that the book is exactly like mint except you looked at it, you breathed on it, or you touched it.

02:52.303 --> 02:53.867
That means it's actually been handled.

02:54.449 --> 02:59.483
A book in fine condition should not have any defect whatsoever.

02:59.463 --> 03:06.777
A book in very good condition can have minor defects, but they should not in any way impair the integrity of the book or the dust wrapper.

03:06.798 --> 03:08.761
Well, what's near fine, then, which you see all the time?

03:08.882 --> 03:09.603
What's near fine?

03:09.884 --> 03:14.653
That's somebody's wish that it was fine, but can't make it fine, so it has to come up with an alternative.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.818
One of the greatest things about book collecting is reading catalogs.

03:18.278 --> 03:19.560
A very quick story.

03:19.861 --> 03:37.266
I once had a book which had its front cover detached, its spine was missing, its back pages were missing, somebody Crayola'd five of the pages, pages 13 through 17 were missing, and there was a ring from water stained on the front cover, and the dealer said, otherwise, fine.

03:38.697 --> 03:41.300
So be careful when you're reading them catalogs.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.181
Okay.

03:44.243 --> 03:45.384
Let's go out to Anne.

03:45.805 --> 03:46.966
You're on with the book guys.

03:47.106 --> 03:47.427
Hi, Anne.

03:47.787 --> 03:48.468
Hi, how are you?

03:48.488 --> 03:48.548
Hi.

03:48.568 --> 03:48.888
Very good.

03:48.948 --> 03:50.050
Thanks for taking my call.

03:50.570 --> 04:08.350
This is a very interesting show, and it has reminded me that when I was just out of college, which was a long time ago, I used to wander around used bookstores, and I was looking through my shelves the other day, and I found a book that I picked up many years ago about Matthew Arnold simply because I had enjoyed Matthew Arnold in college, and I...

04:08.718 --> 04:10.444
just wondering if it was worth anything.

04:12.009 --> 04:17.428
It's called Matthew Arnold and His Relation to the Thought of Our Time, and it was published in 1904.

04:17.510 --> 04:26.378
Unfortunately, Matthew Arnold falls into that category of great authors who were once collectible who no longer have maintained their value.

04:27.399 --> 04:36.046
It's one of the things that you have to be very conscious of if you become a book collector and you really are collecting for value or you want to invest money.

04:36.347 --> 04:47.196
There are a lot of catalogs which will show Matthew Arnold and other authors at a specifically high price, but quite frankly, those market prices have dropped because nobody's no longer interested in them.

04:47.176 --> 04:47.977
for collecting.

04:48.979 --> 04:50.662
The title again was?

04:51.663 --> 04:57.353
Matthew Arnold and His Relation to the Thought of Our Time and Appreciation and the Criticism.

04:57.373 --> 04:57.593
Okay.

04:57.873 --> 04:58.955
Well, that's a later book.

04:58.975 --> 05:02.761
The early, you know, Matthew Arnold, what did you say, was 19?

05:02.781 --> 05:03.643
1904.

05:04.124 --> 05:04.805
That's a reprint.

05:05.326 --> 05:06.367
That's way too late.

05:06.708 --> 05:10.534
Matthew Arnold's earlier, you know, I think he died in, what, 1880?

05:10.554 --> 05:12.277
1880 something.

05:12.317 --> 05:13.639
Yeah, 1880.

05:13.619 --> 05:20.208
There are records on Matthew Arnold books that will go as high as $1,000, but this book being a reprint is really not worth that much.

05:21.750 --> 05:25.395
It's very hard now to really get the $1,000 from Matthew Arnold.

05:26.236 --> 05:32.645
When I was talking, I was thinking more or less 20th century authors like John Goldsworthy and Christopher Morley.

05:33.046 --> 05:34.648
They're great reads, but...

05:34.628 --> 05:38.113
Nobody buys them for resale, I mean, or for collectible.

05:38.634 --> 05:41.118
Your book is a reprint, so let's say $5.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.223
Is that a good price?

05:44.443 --> 05:45.785
That's probably more than I paid for it.

05:45.805 --> 05:47.147
Well, good.

05:47.167 --> 05:47.889
Thanks, Anne.

05:47.909 --> 05:48.249
Thank you.

05:48.690 --> 05:53.397
Now, when you talk about authors that are good authors, good reads, but are out of fashion,

05:53.377 --> 05:55.661
How many of them ever come back into fashion?

05:56.282 --> 06:02.833
Well, I don't know if it's like peg-legged pants or what kind of analogy you make on it.

06:03.174 --> 06:05.638
I mean, occasionally an author will become popular.

06:05.658 --> 06:12.330
I'm not saying Jane Austen has ever gone out of vogue, but with all the movies that came out, there's an interest in Jane Austen for first again.

06:12.310 --> 06:15.114
I don't think that's really a good point.

06:15.134 --> 06:17.537
I was thinking somebody like Edmund Burke, for example.

06:17.637 --> 06:26.109
Nobody read him for a century, and then we heard more and more talk about conservatism politically, and all of a sudden, people are writing biographies and writing about Edmund Burke.

06:26.129 --> 06:29.234
Right, and so, you know, so an Edward Burke-Tratisse is now worth some money.

06:30.155 --> 06:31.457
I'm trying to think of somebody else.

06:31.717 --> 06:32.999
Anthony Trollope.

06:33.379 --> 06:37.205
Anthony Trollope became very popular again when they started doing PBS specials.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.950
I mean, his books really never decreased, decreased in value, but boy, now...

06:40.930 --> 06:44.173
There was a period when Anthony Trollope went up the ladder overnight.

06:44.214 --> 06:46.476
I mean, books that were selling for $100 were now selling for $500.

06:47.177 --> 06:53.664
So, you know, a lot of this has to do with the fact that as movies are adapted or, you know, television takes shows.

06:53.924 --> 06:55.526
I mean, we've seen this with John Gresham.

06:55.826 --> 06:58.149
We've seen it with Forrest Gump.

06:58.169 --> 06:59.110
He's a perfect example.

06:59.130 --> 06:59.670
Oh, sure.

06:59.690 --> 07:03.334
Yeah, I mean, that's a book that couldn't sell for a dollar, but now it's a $400 book.

07:03.795 --> 07:06.938
Okay, who knows who the next popular author is going to be?

07:06.918 --> 07:09.744
But you have pointed out to me the amazing thing.

07:09.764 --> 07:16.900
For example, every week it seems like somebody's making a miniseries of Sidney Shelton, but his books never seem to appreciate in value.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.401
Why is that?

07:17.642 --> 07:23.475
Because I don't think the book collecting world accepts the fact that he's a quality author.

07:23.455 --> 07:30.902
I'm not going to say anything on either side, but there are some authors that just will never be accepted for being valued as literature.

07:31.082 --> 07:37.508
They might be valued as screenplays or TV, but they are never going to make the transition to the literature world, literary world.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.049
Let's go to Roanoke.

07:39.249 --> 07:40.490
Ellen, you're on the book, guys.

07:40.530 --> 07:40.991
How are you?

07:41.751 --> 07:42.192
Hi, Ellen.

07:43.213 --> 07:43.573
Are you there?

07:44.174 --> 07:45.535
Let's check Ellen.

07:45.555 --> 07:47.877
Or have we lost Ellen in Roanoke?

07:47.897 --> 07:49.719
I think we have lost Ellen in Roanoke.

07:49.739 --> 07:51.981
That's too bad, because I wanted to talk with Ellen.

07:52.281 --> 07:53.462
Should I give it one more chance?

07:53.847 --> 07:54.308
Okay.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.432
Are you there, Ellen?

07:57.452 --> 07:57.832
No, Ellen.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.995
We can't seem to find Ellen.

08:00.035 --> 08:02.338
Well, we'll get Ellen.

08:03.699 --> 08:08.265
Yes, our number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

08:08.826 --> 08:13.272
That's the number that you call to get hold of us and get on this radio program.

08:13.632 --> 08:14.794
And that's the only way you can do it.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.577
By the way, when you call, don't be too upset.

08:17.978 --> 08:24.885
if there's nobody on the other line except an answering machine because we want to explain to you we record live to tape.

08:25.385 --> 08:29.149
And that means that we call you at home during the week of our broadcast and put you on the air.

08:29.649 --> 08:36.015
We hate to let a cat out of the bag, but a lot of programs are done that way recently on radio.

08:36.476 --> 08:45.184
And we wanted to do it to make sure that all the stations that carry us could broadcast us first when they wanted to rather than at 9 o'clock on a Thursday or whenever we wanted to do it.

08:45.164 --> 08:48.953
And second of all, because we could get you at home, and it was a lot easier to do.

08:49.013 --> 08:54.124
That number, once again, is 1-800-828-BOOK.

08:54.144 --> 08:54.746
Hope you'll call it.

08:54.986 --> 08:56.850
So once again, 24 hours a day.

08:57.211 --> 09:00.298
Let's get back to the callers as we go all the way out to Colorado.

09:00.518 --> 09:03.004
They're even reading in Colorado these days, huh, Eric?

09:03.338 --> 09:04.359
Hi, how are you doing?

09:04.379 --> 09:05.400
Welcome to the book, guys.

09:05.561 --> 09:06.582
Fine, how are you doing?

09:06.602 --> 09:07.042
Very good.

09:07.343 --> 09:08.724
Yeah, yeah, we read out here.

09:09.305 --> 09:11.648
In between wrangling horses and stuff.

09:11.668 --> 09:12.209
How about skiing?

09:13.070 --> 09:14.672
Well, yeah, I don't ski.

09:14.732 --> 09:15.513
I'm over 40.

09:15.613 --> 09:17.555
I never let my butt get higher than my head.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.300
Sounds good to me.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.261
What do you got for us?

09:22.281 --> 09:25.665
Well, I got this book that my wife's grandmother gave her.

09:26.246 --> 09:29.810
It's called The Wisdom of China and India.

09:29.830 --> 09:29.970
Mm-hmm.

09:30.254 --> 09:32.925
It's edited by Lin Yutang.

09:32.985 --> 09:35.938
Y-U-T-A-N-G is his last name.

09:35.998 --> 09:36.962
It's Random House.

09:36.982 --> 09:37.243
Right.

09:37.713 --> 09:41.859
and copyright in 1942, and it also says first printing.

09:42.380 --> 09:53.998
Lin Yutang probably wrote 35 books on Far Eastern and Eastern philosophy, novels pertaining to the Oriental philosophies.

09:54.338 --> 09:58.685
Unfortunately, none of them sell for more than probably $8 to $10 a volume.

09:59.606 --> 10:04.834
The Wisdom of India and China are probably the most popular book, and it comes in numerous editions.

10:04.814 --> 10:08.119
We'd sell it in the store again for no more than $10.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.200
But it's a good read.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.944
Now, why does it say first printing, and that's usually significant?

10:12.124 --> 10:15.850
Well, a first edition is obviously the book you want to collect.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.672
I mean, obviously this was a first edition.

10:17.933 --> 10:21.558
That doesn't mean that every first edition is worth a lot of money.

10:22.419 --> 10:26.485
Matter of fact, about 90% of all books never go to a second edition.

10:26.465 --> 10:29.388
And then every book in the first edition is worth money.

10:30.329 --> 10:30.990
It's a good read.

10:31.010 --> 10:33.472
I mean, I used to love to read Lin Yu-Tang.

10:33.493 --> 10:45.185
Matter of fact, Second City TV used to have a wonderful parody on it called Lin Yu-Tang Theater, which I love to watch because I thought it was the only person on earth that got what they were trying to do.

10:45.726 --> 10:51.672
And Rick Moranis, I believe, or Dave, the other actor, played Lin Yu-Tang.

10:51.692 --> 10:55.476
And I thought he did a wonderful job because Lin Yu-Tang actually used to go out and lecture.

10:55.456 --> 10:58.239
And I've seen films of them in lectures.

10:58.299 --> 10:59.501
It's a good read.

10:59.621 --> 11:02.084
Unfortunately, it's just not a high-level resale book.

11:02.785 --> 11:03.085
Oh, okay.

11:03.105 --> 11:04.046
Well, thank you very much.

11:04.106 --> 11:04.747
Thank you, Eric.

11:04.767 --> 11:05.828
Good book to read in Colorado.

11:07.671 --> 11:07.811
Great.

11:08.331 --> 11:10.093
Never lets his butt get over his head.

11:10.654 --> 11:12.056
Never do anymore.

11:12.076 --> 11:13.017
Thanks very much, Eric.

11:13.037 --> 11:13.598
Thank you.

11:13.918 --> 11:14.319
Bye-bye.

11:14.339 --> 11:16.401
We're the book guys here at...

11:16.567 --> 11:21.573
at WAMU-FM, where we record this program in Washington, a very famous station in Washington.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.137
We're delighted that you're with us here on our program.

11:24.157 --> 11:28.002
Let's go to Nebraska, a little bit further east than Colorado, at least.

11:28.082 --> 11:29.644
And Nancy, you're on the book, guys.

11:29.904 --> 11:30.825
How are you?

11:30.845 --> 11:32.187
Well, fine.

11:32.227 --> 11:32.748
Thank you.

11:32.828 --> 11:33.429
And you.

11:33.769 --> 11:34.270
Very good.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.732
It's good to talk to you.

11:35.752 --> 11:42.280
And thank you for taking this call, because I'm really curious about this book.

11:42.701 --> 11:42.861
It's a

11:43.432 --> 11:50.262
One of the small, red Beidecker travel books that's on southern Italy, southern Italy and Sicily.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.385
And I believe it was published 1883.

11:52.786 --> 11:54.849
It's an early Beidecker guide.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.433
Beidecker's are highly collectible.

11:57.773 --> 12:06.486
The most valuable, the highest ones are the Russia that sells for anywhere from $300 to $500, the ones in either English or in French.

12:06.466 --> 12:13.203
Egypt is about $250, especially the issue that came out right after the discovery of the Tutankhamen tomb.

12:14.006 --> 12:15.690
The United States sells for $100.

12:16.251 --> 12:18.016
Canada sells for about $100.

12:18.096 --> 12:19.600
But, Alan, she said Italy.

12:19.720 --> 12:19.961
I know.

12:19.981 --> 12:21.204
I'm working myself down.

12:21.345 --> 12:21.505
Oh, no.

12:21.485 --> 12:27.894
We have a lot of countries to go before we get to Italy, especially southern Italy.

12:28.996 --> 12:36.727
The majority of the Italian Betacus sell for anywhere between $15 to $35, depending on condition.

12:37.288 --> 12:39.451
And so you fall within that category.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.417
But collecting Betacus is a wonderful, wonderful area to go.

12:43.978 --> 12:44.899
There are some wonderful books.

12:44.939 --> 12:46.401
Constantinople is $200.

12:46.502 --> 12:46.802
Really?

12:47.263 --> 12:48.184
Right.

12:48.164 --> 12:50.249
But, again, I'm of Italian.

12:50.309 --> 12:55.661
My mother's of Italian heritage, and she was from southern Italy, and I would really love to see it be worth more money than it is.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.566
This is such a charming book.

12:57.586 --> 12:58.047
It's wonderful.

12:58.067 --> 13:06.426
In the very beginning, when they talk about money in Italy, it says, remember, throughout the whole of Italy, the French franc is the...

13:06.845 --> 13:29.190
is the money that is used throughout the nation and sicily it's just wonderful all kinds of wonderful little things like that oh the nice thing is nancy if you've got one baedeker you can start a collection right maybe i could i hadn't thought of that but i certainly indeed might well thank you very much indeed i've always been curious about it um

13:29.373 --> 13:30.336
And now I know.

13:30.436 --> 13:33.003
It's a lovely little book, and I'm going to keep it.

13:33.023 --> 13:34.146
Thank you, Nancy, for calling us.

13:34.287 --> 13:34.929
Bye-bye.

13:35.109 --> 13:35.811
We're the Book Guys.

13:35.871 --> 13:38.639
Our number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

13:38.659 --> 13:42.490
You call that number, and you, like Bruce in Florida, can be with us in just a moment.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.395
We're the Book Guys.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.298
I'm Mike Cuthbert, along with Alan Stipek.

14:16.338 --> 14:20.723
Our number, once again, is 1-800-828-BOOK for all your questions on books.

14:21.144 --> 14:22.365
Let's go next to Florida.

14:22.466 --> 14:24.088
And, Bruce, welcome to the book, guys.

14:24.128 --> 14:24.929
What have you got for us?

14:25.249 --> 14:25.510
Hello there.

14:25.570 --> 14:26.090
Thank you, Mike.

14:26.110 --> 14:26.491
How are you?

14:26.571 --> 14:27.032
Very good.

14:27.412 --> 14:27.953
Good.

14:28.113 --> 14:32.919
I've got a curiosity here that I found that one of my wife's relatives had had.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.062
It's called The Victor Book of the Opera.

14:36.564 --> 14:42.512
Stories of 70 Grand Operas, published by the Victor Talking Machine Company,

14:42.661 --> 14:46.493
In 1912, I have lots of illustrations of old opera stars and things.

14:47.236 --> 14:50.024
I was just curious if this book has any interest.

14:50.044 --> 14:51.810
Do you want the long answer or the short answer?

14:53.798 --> 14:55.020
Whatever is most interesting.

14:55.060 --> 15:03.651
Okay, well, the long answer is it's an interesting book to read, and it came out in many editions, and it was a very popular book for over 30 years.

15:04.091 --> 15:06.875
So popular that there must be 7 million copies floating around.

15:07.536 --> 15:15.226
Okay, and unfortunately, unless you're a record collector, and at this point there's not that many 78 people out there, it really doesn't have that much of a market value.

15:15.526 --> 15:19.131
We sell it in a score for up to $5.

15:19.111 --> 15:24.162
But other than that, it's still a good read, because it is a good history of music at that time period.

15:24.182 --> 15:26.226
Yes, it definitely will.

15:26.246 --> 15:28.110
Do you have anything else, sir, Bruce?

15:28.170 --> 15:29.713
Yeah, a couple things.

15:29.733 --> 15:33.341
One about that old, and also another one a little bit newer.

15:33.361 --> 15:36.167
I have a novel by Winston Churchill called The Crossing.

15:36.187 --> 15:36.528
Right.

15:36.548 --> 15:37.710
Wrong Winston Churchill.

15:38.247 --> 15:39.209
Wrong Winston Churchill.

15:39.229 --> 15:39.390
Right.

15:39.410 --> 15:40.493
There are two Winston Churchills.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.074
Interesting.

15:41.094 --> 15:47.029
There is Winston Churchill, the American author, who wrote Inside the Cup and The Crossing and various other ones.

15:47.470 --> 15:48.493
You know, Richard Carvel.

15:48.673 --> 15:50.418
I mean, you remember that book, right, Bruce?

15:50.438 --> 15:53.666
This is obviously a novel of colonial America.

15:53.706 --> 15:54.207
That's right.

15:54.408 --> 15:54.889
Yeah.

15:54.869 --> 16:11.472
That is the American Winston Churchill, not to be mistaken, with Sir Winston Churchill, who also wrote at that time period such books as, to Lady Smith, a story of the South African Boer War, and various other books, which are now worth in the thousands.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.477
Unfortunately, your Winston Churchill is worth about a dollar.

16:15.457 --> 16:28.930
He's a very unpopular author as far as collectability, and is very famous probably for so many booksellers who have quoted his books thinking they had a Sir Winston Churchill who is highly collectible and have got an egg on their face.

16:30.471 --> 16:40.421
In fact, as a matter of fact, Alan, on a previous program, you listed a whole bunch of things not to invest in, not to buy, and Winston Churchill, I believe, was number one or two.

16:40.561 --> 16:44.485
I think it was number one, and we called him the other Winston Churchill.

16:45.123 --> 16:50.070
So, you know, you're a proud owner of the other Winston Churchill.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.231
Thanks very much for calling.

16:51.271 --> 16:52.773
Okay, thanks very much.

16:52.894 --> 16:53.314
Thank you.

16:53.615 --> 16:55.477
That's Bruce down in Florida.

16:55.858 --> 16:59.543
Let's go next to Roanoke, and Ellen, you're next on the book, guys.

17:00.224 --> 17:00.824
Hi, how are you?

17:00.865 --> 17:01.365
Very good.

17:01.485 --> 17:09.637
I have a collection that my husband has bought, and it's the Canterbury Edition Complete Books of Joseph Conrad.

17:09.877 --> 17:10.017
Mm-hmm.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.206
And he has 24 volumes.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.950
I think that's complete and dated 1924.

17:15.170 --> 17:16.112
Right.

17:16.212 --> 17:17.634
That's not the one that's signed.

17:17.654 --> 17:18.956
This is the one in the green.

17:19.778 --> 17:20.559
There's two editions.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.482
This is in the green cloth or the blue cloth.

17:22.682 --> 17:24.104
Sort of bluish gray.

17:24.164 --> 17:24.365
Yes.

17:25.106 --> 17:25.847
Okay.

17:26.288 --> 17:29.693
Some of those are actually true first editions of Joseph Conrad novels.

17:31.356 --> 17:32.357
It's not signed.

17:32.417 --> 17:33.399
It's not the sign limited.

17:33.499 --> 17:34.080
Is that correct?

17:34.364 --> 17:35.706
I think you're correct.

17:35.726 --> 17:48.048
Yeah, you would know in volume one it would say if it's signed because there's an edition that came out at about the same time, 40 volumes in a white-like buckram cloth that sells for about $500 that's signed.

17:48.348 --> 17:52.896
Your set sells for anywhere from $250 to $400 depending on the condition.

17:53.146 --> 17:54.449
Okay, it's in pretty good condition.

17:54.489 --> 17:54.729
Good.

17:54.909 --> 17:55.370
Very good.

17:55.511 --> 17:56.192
Thanks a lot.

17:56.212 --> 17:57.114
Thank you.

17:57.134 --> 17:57.294
Bye-bye.

17:57.314 --> 17:58.116
Thank you for calling.

17:58.176 --> 18:04.468
We'd like to remind you, speaking of calling, that our number is very simple, 1-800-828-BOOK.

18:04.488 --> 18:10.159
It's open 24 hours a day, and we answer a lot of questions, even if you don't get on the air, and most of you will.

18:10.139 --> 18:22.973
The questions that you have about the books you own and the books that you would like to preserve, as we had a caller earlier this evening who wanted to preserve her family's copy of The Complete Shakespeare, even though it had no market value, will give you tips on that as well.

18:23.213 --> 18:27.097
And, of course, you can listen to the program every week and get that same kind of information.

18:27.478 --> 18:34.425
But if you're really in a hurry and you'd like to get on the program, the number is 1-800-828-BOOK, B-O-O-K.

18:34.962 --> 18:36.344
We have Bruce from Florida.

18:36.364 --> 18:39.870
Let's go to Bruce in the District of Columbia.

18:39.930 --> 18:41.553
Bruce, welcome to the Book Guys.

18:41.773 --> 18:43.917
Well, thank you, Mike, and fellow Book Guys.

18:44.037 --> 18:44.758
Alan, how are you?

18:44.919 --> 18:45.439
I'm fine, Bruce.

18:45.459 --> 18:45.860
How are you doing?

18:45.960 --> 18:46.241
Good.

18:46.882 --> 18:49.727
Cleaning up my basement just today, this is kind of fortuitous.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.229
I ran across an old book.

18:51.249 --> 18:51.930
I'm just curious.

18:51.990 --> 18:56.037
I doubt that it's worth much, but it's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll.

18:56.979 --> 18:58.962
Random House edition dated.

18:59.282 --> 19:00.885
It's...

19:01.675 --> 19:05.881
With the illustrations by Fritz Cadell, by any chance?

19:08.344 --> 19:09.285
You're amazing.

19:09.305 --> 19:09.706
Thank you.

19:10.086 --> 19:11.328
Thank you.

19:11.668 --> 19:21.962
Yes, is it the limited edition club edition issued by Random House of the Alice illustrated by Fritz Cadell?

19:22.145 --> 19:24.488
I don't see any reference.

19:24.608 --> 19:25.269
Special edition.

19:25.389 --> 19:25.969
Yes.

19:25.989 --> 19:29.473
Okay, but in the back, is it signed as limitation?

19:29.854 --> 19:30.114
No.

19:30.234 --> 19:30.795
Okay.

19:30.815 --> 19:35.921
There are four or five editions illustrated by Fritz Cadell of Alice that came out in the 40s.

19:36.061 --> 19:39.926
One, the LEC, limited edition club, which sells for a couple hundred dollars.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.469
Then there's the Heritage Press edition and the edition you have.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.313
That edition generally sells for, is it a red binding?

19:46.917 --> 19:47.998
Or is it the blue one?

19:48.018 --> 19:48.539
It's blue.

19:48.559 --> 19:49.120
It's blue.

19:49.140 --> 19:52.043
It sells for about $15 to $30, depending on the condition.

19:52.464 --> 19:53.725
It's a popular book.

19:53.745 --> 20:03.978
Alice is interesting because when it was published, the true first edition of Alice in Wonderland was suppressed by the author because they did not like the illustrations.

20:04.038 --> 20:07.101
So the actual real first edition is the second edition.

20:07.402 --> 20:10.926
And that sells for thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars.

20:11.326 --> 20:13.549
And not until 1896,

20:13.529 --> 20:18.836
Or is anybody else allowed to do the illustrations other than John Tenniel because there was a copyright law?

20:18.856 --> 20:32.274
But the second that the copyright law elapsed, about 100 people illustrated the book and came out with a variety of different interpretations of Alice in Wonderland, which created a new market in collecting Alice.

20:32.334 --> 20:36.440
There are hundreds of different illustrators for Alice in Wonderland, of which Fritz Cradell is one of them.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.543
But do you really think this book is worth $15 to $30?

20:38.843 --> 20:40.966
I hope it is because that's what we sell it for in the store.

20:41.046 --> 20:41.106
Ah.

20:42.368 --> 20:46.173
Well, maybe I should go back and clean the basement a little more and see if I can find the limited edition.

20:46.493 --> 20:47.174
Well, good luck.

20:47.534 --> 20:48.535
Thank you very much for calling.

20:48.816 --> 20:49.136
Thank you.

20:49.276 --> 20:51.859
Most people store their books in their basement or their attic.

20:51.899 --> 20:55.103
If you had your choice and you had to store them either place, which would you pick?

20:55.263 --> 20:57.206
Well, it would depend if you're living at sea level or not.

20:57.406 --> 21:01.391
I would certainly think that the attic would be better if your roof was good.

21:01.711 --> 21:07.718
It tends to be less apt to have mildew, so attic, except it's along a hall.

21:07.985 --> 21:10.429
We've got time for one more quick call.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.954
Alexis, you're next and quick with the book guys.

21:13.515 --> 21:14.076
Hello.

21:14.096 --> 21:14.456
Hi there.

21:14.697 --> 21:15.118
Hi.

21:15.138 --> 21:15.899
I'll do a real quick one.

21:15.939 --> 21:23.833
I have a book of modern British poetry, blue leather-bound, heavily embossed, Key Nelson and Sons in London.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.626
In Edinburgh in 1864, and I didn't know if it might be worth something.

21:27.646 --> 21:29.328
Does it have illustrations in it?

21:29.348 --> 21:29.929
Yes, it does.

21:29.949 --> 21:30.630
Steel engravings?

21:30.811 --> 21:31.632
They seem to be, yes.

21:31.912 --> 21:32.233
Okay.

21:32.593 --> 21:34.917
A guesstimate, a general book of that time period.

21:34.937 --> 21:35.618
What's the size?

21:35.798 --> 21:36.680
Eight and a half by 11?

21:37.100 --> 21:37.822
No, it's smaller.

21:37.882 --> 21:39.965
It's four by seven.

21:40.025 --> 21:40.786
Four by seven.

21:41.147 --> 21:45.754
Most probably worth anywhere from $30 to $75, depending on the condition and the illustrations.

21:45.734 --> 21:46.516
Okay, wonderful.

21:46.536 --> 21:47.257
Thank you very much.

21:47.358 --> 21:48.099
Thank you very much.

21:48.119 --> 21:49.402
You know, I bumped into a book the other day.

21:49.422 --> 21:51.186
It was called The Gift of 1895.

21:51.868 --> 21:52.349
Big deal.

21:52.629 --> 21:53.391
Bunch of authors.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.338
Hardly meaningful at all except for one thing.

21:56.438 --> 21:56.779
What's that?

21:56.919 --> 21:58.783
The Purloined Letter by Edgar Allan Poe.

21:58.903 --> 21:59.886
Wrong year, Mike.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.670
Was it 1845?

22:01.790 --> 22:01.870
Yes.

22:01.850 --> 22:02.511
That's right.

22:02.531 --> 22:02.751
1845.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.113
I knew it was something five.

22:04.794 --> 22:07.317
Would never have guessed it had something valuable in it, but it did.

22:07.697 --> 22:12.063
So some of these collection books are not always less valuable than what you think.

22:12.183 --> 22:17.269
Oh, sometimes they're the finds of the year, because that's where the first appearance of specific books are.

22:17.289 --> 22:22.436
The first appearance of The Star Spangled Banner is in a magazine, The Analectic, in 1814.

22:22.696 --> 22:25.440
What's the tune to The Star Spangled Banner?

22:25.460 --> 22:25.740
Do you know?

22:26.120 --> 22:26.541
The tune?
