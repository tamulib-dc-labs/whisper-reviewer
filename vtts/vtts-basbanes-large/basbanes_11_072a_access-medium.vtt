WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.918
Oh, really?

00:04.039 --> 00:05.740
Arm & Hammer bought it.

00:06.081 --> 00:06.401
Yes.

00:09.524 --> 00:12.467
Well, we've done two hours of tape.

00:12.487 --> 00:13.007
You know that?

00:13.267 --> 00:14.208
We're doing very good.

00:14.849 --> 00:15.430
I'm delighted.

00:17.672 --> 00:21.876
So that's where you were able to do something good for your country as well?

00:23.037 --> 00:24.638
Well, that was unexpected.

00:24.658 --> 00:29.023
No, I come to this.

00:29.043 --> 00:30.544
I mean, that's not to booze.

00:31.418 --> 00:39.929
because I can assure you one thing, and that's for sure, that the books are sold here.

00:42.132 --> 00:48.460
I could have sold them anywhere in the world and probably, I don't say, that's for sure, but probably at that price.

00:48.480 --> 01:01.037
I always had a weak heart for that library because of this one librarian of the Amsterdam University Library.

01:01.591 --> 01:05.515
He was a great, great bookman, and he taught me so much.

01:05.555 --> 01:10.040
He has always supported me.

01:11.682 --> 01:12.843
Did you tell me his name yet?

01:13.724 --> 01:15.306
No, I did not.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.929
But everybody knows him in the book.

01:18.249 --> 01:24.536
No, everybody who knows books knows the history of, let's say, the last 50 years.

01:24.556 --> 01:25.197
And what's his name?

01:26.238 --> 01:27.019
It's a difficult name.

01:27.039 --> 01:27.820
It's a French name.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.923
I mean, it's...

01:31.257 --> 01:37.524
D-E-L-A, it's French name.

01:37.544 --> 01:38.646
That's easy.

01:39.827 --> 01:41.088
F-O-N-T-A-I-N-E.

01:45.013 --> 01:47.035
That's the Dutch part.

01:49.578 --> 01:49.818
V-E-R-W-E-Y.

01:51.180 --> 01:51.520
V-E-R-W-E-Y.

01:52.141 --> 01:54.564
V-E-R-W-E-Y.

01:56.887 --> 01:58.969
That's his first name.

01:59.354 --> 02:01.136
Oh, it's De La Fontaine Verwey.

02:01.216 --> 02:02.597
And the first name is Hermann.

02:04.879 --> 02:05.860
So it's Hermann.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.962
Hermann De La Fontaine Verwey.

02:07.982 --> 02:09.924
Hermann De La Fontaine Verwey.

02:10.184 --> 02:17.712
You also have a name from 1941, I think.

02:17.732 --> 02:20.234
Is there a hyphen between De La Fontaine and Verwey?

02:20.394 --> 02:23.097
It's not De La Fontaine.

02:23.257 --> 02:26.340
Like De La Fontaine, the French writer.

02:28.227 --> 02:32.050
And he was a great librarian here.

02:32.170 --> 02:33.772
He was a great, great librarian.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.573
He was one of the greatest.

02:35.593 --> 02:36.234
What makes sense?

02:36.254 --> 02:39.176
He was a great librarian for Bill Jackson.

02:39.196 --> 02:40.517
He was what again?

02:40.537 --> 02:41.939
The class of Bill Jackson.

02:42.319 --> 02:42.699
Oh, yes.

02:42.779 --> 02:47.563
And other librarians after then.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.484
Urban Liebers.

02:48.724 --> 02:49.445
He is famous.

02:49.765 --> 02:51.667
What makes a great librarian in your view?

02:52.107 --> 02:53.729
What makes a great librarian?

02:53.749 --> 02:55.670
A great librarian.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.812
It's he who

02:58.349 --> 03:26.432
knows what he's buying who knows when to say no but who knows that he has to say yes even if he doesn't have the money so how does he know this is it that is the same

03:26.750 --> 03:28.473
That's the tuition, that's the same thing.

03:28.493 --> 03:30.215
Or his specialty, or whatever.

03:31.757 --> 03:36.024
And those to say... And those to say yes, even if he doesn't have the money.

03:36.224 --> 03:37.005
Even if he doesn't.

03:37.526 --> 03:42.593
I sold books, not only in the first library, in April.

03:43.134 --> 03:47.621
And then he said, Nico, I'm sorry, but I can't pay you before the next year.

03:49.824 --> 03:50.846
And he said, that's okay.

03:50.866 --> 03:53.069
That's okay.

03:53.810 --> 03:55.913
Some idiot who...

03:57.226 --> 03:58.327
So is he still there?

03:58.347 --> 04:04.693
No, no, he died in 1989.

04:06.274 --> 04:10.358
And did he personally, was he responsible for helping build a great collection there?

04:11.239 --> 04:21.308
He built the... Because when I came there, Amsterdam was the center in the 17th century of the atlas and met graves.

04:21.328 --> 04:24.651
And I came and started selling

04:25.627 --> 04:28.471
They missed me all the great entrances.

04:29.472 --> 04:30.794
Here at the center?

04:31.035 --> 04:32.417
At the center.

04:32.437 --> 04:39.907
And he was wise enough and courageous enough and capable of getting money enough to buy them.

04:39.927 --> 04:40.488
And I found them.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.432
And so how would you rank their collection today?

04:44.033 --> 04:45.375
It's the best in the world.

04:45.555 --> 04:47.318
Certainly Amsterdam.

04:47.478 --> 04:48.880
And so you helped make it the best.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.466
Yeah, but I've seen my... I mean, I became, what age was that?

04:53.486 --> 04:54.047
Seventy?

04:54.500 --> 05:01.550
They presented me with a kind of album I'm calling.

05:01.570 --> 05:01.991
Oh, really?

05:02.612 --> 05:11.745
Yeah, I've ever seen it.

05:11.926 --> 05:17.754
I know.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.304
Well, that's very important, because this was the center of the trade.

05:24.723 --> 05:26.686
They should have the great collection here.

05:27.186 --> 05:28.608
The great collection should be here.

05:28.988 --> 05:32.954
Yeah, not only have it, it is... Oh, we need the... Sorry.

05:33.755 --> 05:35.237
We need the manuscript.

05:35.397 --> 05:36.839
Oh, we have it.

05:39.162 --> 05:39.903
What book is this?

05:40.343 --> 05:48.874
That's what I... They call it The Well Assured Bookbinding.

05:50.862 --> 05:51.943
They're well shredded.

05:51.963 --> 05:52.884
Oh, that's wonderful.

05:52.964 --> 05:56.729
If you want, I'll present you with a copy.

05:56.749 --> 06:00.473
Then you don't have to schlep that.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.174
I'll schlep it.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.057
It's important.

06:04.518 --> 06:06.320
You know how the bookman is, right?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.062
It is like a game.

06:09.303 --> 06:13.308
It is provincial, because it is a provincial country.

06:13.588 --> 06:14.509
It is not the world.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.752
But there are some interesting articles in

06:17.339 --> 06:37.627
One of the things I like best, and I'll illustrate probably best, my attitude towards book selling and books and people with this article.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.169
I'm really touched by this.

06:40.130 --> 06:45.658
I'm going to send you a signed first edition of my book, if I may, if you'd like.

06:46.752 --> 06:47.092
Yeah.

06:47.113 --> 06:50.818
I mean, this is one of my dear customers.

06:50.898 --> 06:53.542
Lord Weddington, Orange File.

06:53.562 --> 06:54.503
That's page 495.

06:54.663 --> 06:55.805
I'm telling you the tapes.

06:55.905 --> 06:57.768
I don't know what I've found here, too.

06:57.788 --> 06:58.148
It is.

06:58.389 --> 07:01.734
I mean, this is about what you... what I told you.

07:03.196 --> 07:04.257
Oh, this is very important.

07:07.001 --> 07:08.924
Oh, this is on your 70th birthday.

07:09.064 --> 07:10.947
Oh, that is the old book.

07:11.468 --> 07:14.833
It's in... Yeah, it's very important.

07:14.853 --> 07:15.814
I like very much.

07:16.115 --> 07:28.927
And it's in English, too, which is very important for me.

07:29.067 --> 07:34.712
Oh, look at the people who wrote for this.

07:34.732 --> 07:36.093
This is really huge.

07:36.113 --> 07:37.935
Yeah, this is very important.

07:42.099 --> 07:43.320
Oh, this is great.

07:43.992 --> 07:53.541
An exhibition in the University Library of 70 books, maps, objects.

07:54.522 --> 08:03.211
I saw to any of the Dutch libraries and they found of enough importance to include in this exhibition.

08:04.012 --> 08:04.993
This exhibition here?

08:05.754 --> 08:06.474
No.

08:06.594 --> 08:07.335
This is Lois.

08:07.595 --> 08:07.956
I see.

08:07.976 --> 08:08.316
Okay.

08:08.516 --> 08:11.299
This is a kind of...

08:11.819 --> 08:13.461
Oh, this is a compliment.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.002
I see.

08:14.122 --> 08:14.402
I see.

08:14.543 --> 08:14.823
I see.

08:14.883 --> 08:15.424
I get it now.

08:15.444 --> 08:16.545
I get it.

08:16.565 --> 08:16.906
I see it.

08:17.647 --> 08:18.228
That's in touch.

08:18.808 --> 08:19.449
That's in touch.

08:20.831 --> 08:21.152
Wow.

08:21.372 --> 08:23.735
You're going to let me take one?

08:23.775 --> 08:24.596
You're welcome.

08:24.616 --> 08:32.947
I would be honored and touched, and I would like to reciprocate by sending you a first edition copy of my book, which is now in the sixth printing.

08:32.967 --> 08:37.894
I have your book, but it's in my... It's sold with my business.

08:38.397 --> 08:44.125
Well, you probably didn't have the first edition, though.

08:44.145 --> 08:45.046
It was very scarce.

08:45.106 --> 08:45.747
It disappeared.

08:46.028 --> 08:58.685
The first printing was only... I say, I never wanted to be a British man.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.847
That's absolutely true.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.989
I never had any ambition.

09:01.850 --> 09:02.651
Have you?

09:02.671 --> 09:02.911
No.

09:03.132 --> 09:03.352
No.

09:03.532 --> 09:07.678
I mean, always could live the life that I like to live.

09:08.620 --> 09:22.597
And it's so important to have a good wife.

09:22.757 --> 09:26.501
Yeah, I have a good wife.

09:28.924 --> 09:32.248
My wife supported me.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.325
A book girl, but to be a good publication girl?

09:36.466 --> 09:37.968
I became a book girl.

09:38.990 --> 09:39.911
My wife is the same.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.936
I quit my job to write my book.

09:42.956 --> 09:47.343
I had to... In 1991, when I worked for the newspaper.

09:47.363 --> 09:49.947
In 1991, I figured, I can't do both.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.170
I can't do this and do that kind of stuff.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.995
And so, you know, your wife has to believe in what you're doing.

09:55.115 --> 09:56.738
Let's put it that way.

09:56.758 --> 09:57.399
So it's worked out.

09:57.439 --> 10:00.784
And now I've got a good contract for this book, the book I'm working on now.

10:01.422 --> 10:03.324
because the last one did pretty well.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.346
And they'll be probably the same?

10:05.366 --> 10:06.007
The same people.

10:06.448 --> 10:13.315
And I think I'm going to put on the cover that Dürer engraving, Erasmus of Rotterdam, the famous engraving.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.598
I love that with the books.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.600
And you have something to connect it with.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.082
Yes, because I love it.

10:19.142 --> 10:20.183
I love the engraving.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.907
And it's a Dürer engraving.

10:23.927 --> 10:24.988
And it is European.

10:25.028 --> 10:29.854
It is scholarly.

10:29.874 --> 10:30.855
It is...

10:31.493 --> 10:38.262
He is, in my mind, the first great professional bookman.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.644
He was a writer.

10:39.664 --> 10:40.825
He made a living as a writer.

10:41.686 --> 10:44.150
The first one.

10:44.870 --> 10:45.371
That's right.

10:45.772 --> 10:51.579
It touches a lot of different themes that I'm working on.

10:51.659 --> 10:53.702
That's right.

10:54.063 --> 10:54.803
Exactly.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.205
You're a good writer.

10:56.986 --> 10:57.827
You're worth something.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.149
So I think we'll do that.

10:59.269 --> 11:01.332
No, but I...

11:02.223 --> 11:03.244
Always like to trade.

11:03.765 --> 11:05.488
I like to trade for three reasons.

11:08.151 --> 11:16.824
The material you're doing is the people and the way of life.

11:17.164 --> 11:21.090
I mean, it's always been a friendly trade so far.

11:23.413 --> 11:27.579
We never considered ourselves to be competitors.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.964
Even our crowds were very competitive.

11:31.096 --> 11:43.007
Competitive, but when we were together, it was always in a friendly way we were dealing with, and at auction, okay, then I'll let you have that one.

11:43.027 --> 11:44.248
In his own one.

11:44.388 --> 11:46.249
But you'd go to the middle of that one.

11:47.250 --> 11:50.653
And things like that, I mean, that's worked out very well.

11:50.673 --> 11:52.095
You have to have these understandings.

11:52.115 --> 12:00.462
And I have been fortunate enough to know, to have known, maybe all the great deals in here,

12:01.285 --> 12:12.058
France, England, Spain, England.

12:12.078 --> 12:18.686
And that was great satisfaction because they were great, great booksellers.

12:18.706 --> 12:20.929
And do you see that tradition continuing today?

12:21.369 --> 12:24.393
Yeah, there are, but less of them.

12:24.413 --> 12:26.656
But there are less books too.

12:26.676 --> 12:29.419
Yeah, in America, some very good young people.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.481
Bill Rees is very interesting.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.163
Bill Rees is very good, yes.

12:34.243 --> 12:35.004
Specialized, very good.

12:35.725 --> 12:40.409
I think I have a man like Richard Lamb, very good.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.651
Richard Lamb, where is he?

12:42.671 --> 12:49.298
He is, Maktayan Lamb is the firm's name, 57th grade.

12:50.059 --> 12:51.700
Oh yes, okay, yes.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.722
Richard Lamb, very good bookseller.

12:53.742 --> 12:54.703
Yeah.

12:57.206 --> 12:58.647
But not like photography.

12:59.015 --> 12:59.736
Better like who?

13:00.116 --> 13:08.964
Not like before, I mean, with your gig sightings and Warren Owls and Krauss and Fleming.

13:08.984 --> 13:10.325
And Fleming, John Fleming.

13:10.405 --> 13:22.997
John Fleming, he used to, like you write in your book, John Fleming was ideal.

13:24.018 --> 13:26.440
He always worked like he was not interested at all.

13:26.892 --> 13:31.677
He always showed that he could easily do without you.

13:31.697 --> 13:33.699
When you came, you were a welcome guest.

13:35.141 --> 13:37.603
Yeah, and then he could sell you a great book.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.906
And when he liked you, he could sell you a great book.

13:40.366 --> 13:41.107
So much the better.

13:41.127 --> 13:44.591
I tell somewhere the story of our books.

13:44.611 --> 13:48.274
One of the great copy that I've seen in my life, and I've had some more.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.357
One of the great books in the world.

13:50.417 --> 13:55.482
The first illustrated books.

13:55.664 --> 14:25.553
He said, come on, John, show me the book.

14:26.798 --> 14:34.828
And then he gave this copy of this, which is notoriously rare, it is in the condition.

14:39.233 --> 14:43.178
And then I asked him, okay, John, now you're done with your prize.

14:43.478 --> 14:45.500
Now, what was the title of the book again?

14:45.520 --> 14:46.301
What was the book?

14:46.422 --> 14:47.343
Oh, okay.

14:47.443 --> 14:48.544
Oh, okay.

14:48.905 --> 14:52.148
In a fantastic copy.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.152
I said, okay, John, now the prize.

14:57.342 --> 15:02.006
He said, I'm sorry, Nico, but I had to ask you so, so much.

15:02.026 --> 15:07.251
I said, you are a louse to ask you so much, but I'll show you something different.

15:07.271 --> 15:07.992
I'm a louse, too.

15:08.072 --> 15:08.893
I'm going to buy it.

15:10.995 --> 15:11.816
Right, just like that.

15:12.536 --> 15:12.897
How much?

15:13.537 --> 15:16.520
A lot, though.

15:16.941 --> 15:17.661
But it was a lot.

15:17.681 --> 15:20.304
But cheap compared to the pictures today that's coming.

15:21.105 --> 15:26.329
And when you buy a book like this, you don't have a customer in mind.

15:26.349 --> 15:26.910
No, I don't know.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.181
No, you never buy for a fine time.

15:30.421 --> 15:31.422
I never bought for a fine time.

15:31.462 --> 15:32.423
You see, that's different.

15:32.744 --> 15:47.840
Most young booksellers today, they are afraid to... No, but you can't, because with the amounts, the money, you need it to use.

15:47.860 --> 15:58.332
So you never bought with a... No, I've never... No, but sometimes, obviously, but... Better don't... For me, you know, better do not buy books.

15:58.717 --> 16:00.379
It's a special client of mine.

16:02.681 --> 16:03.242
Why, because?

16:03.262 --> 16:06.446
Because generally, the client says no.

16:06.506 --> 16:10.550
That's, I don't know why, but it's actually lucky.

16:10.570 --> 16:17.338
That happened with Lou Feldman, who took $100,000 on the Gutenberg Bible, figuring Texas would buy it.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.781
Good man.

16:19.801 --> 16:21.322
Yeah.

16:21.422 --> 16:22.343
How are you, Lou?

16:23.625 --> 16:25.988
Spent many hours together.

16:26.008 --> 16:26.748
Do you want to get that?

16:26.768 --> 16:27.289
No, no, no.

16:29.024 --> 16:30.406
He was an interesting man.

16:30.446 --> 16:31.507
He was an interesting man.

16:31.527 --> 16:32.429
Now, what did you think of him?

16:33.029 --> 16:33.810
Did you like him?

16:34.251 --> 16:34.972
Oh, yes.

16:35.052 --> 16:36.334
People either liked him or hated him.

16:36.514 --> 16:37.696
Well, that's a long ways.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.418
They don't have to love you.

16:41.541 --> 16:41.981
No.

16:42.362 --> 16:43.003
That's good, yeah.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.407
But there had to be something, somebody.

16:46.447 --> 16:48.771
And he was somebody who felt him.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.417
And then he had, of course, his fantastic lines.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.744
Most millions of dollars.

16:59.534 --> 17:03.399
That's, you know, that only happens once in a lifetime, to get a client like that.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.922
But he did a good job for them.

17:06.063 --> 17:08.266
They have a great... They couldn't have done better.

17:09.027 --> 17:11.731
They couldn't have done better without it.

17:11.751 --> 17:14.635
That was fantastic.

17:14.655 --> 17:19.522
I know, you are so... A great bookseller, a new experience, helped made it well.

17:19.622 --> 17:28.495
I mean, listen, it's not such that a bookseller is...

17:29.825 --> 17:35.471
in such a shared business, that's a lie, that's your lab or death.

17:36.712 --> 17:39.054
It's kind of a game.

17:40.616 --> 17:41.317
A game.

17:43.519 --> 17:49.365
I mean, when buying, you have to outwit the other buyers.

17:51.046 --> 17:57.133
And then when you're selling, you have to persuade the buyer that he's buying the right thing.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.595
And never let the customer down.

18:00.588 --> 18:02.150
That's not an easy thing to do, is it?

18:02.331 --> 18:05.435
Those three things is... No, but that is the game.

18:08.119 --> 18:08.640
That's great.

18:10.202 --> 18:11.604
That's great.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.445
That is the game.

18:12.585 --> 18:14.628
And you call it a game because it is a game, isn't it?

18:14.648 --> 18:15.089
It is a game.

18:16.691 --> 18:18.754
When it becomes serious, I don't become so dumb.

18:20.136 --> 18:25.684
Maybe the German rare food dealers have something, a lot of that, being over serious.

18:29.815 --> 18:37.744
But after the war, though, when they lost all of their great Jewish booksellers, there were really no great German booksellers for many, many years.

18:37.804 --> 18:44.892
No, he was, like I said, but not exposing himself.

18:45.072 --> 18:48.776
He was into it, as a bookseller, as it is possible.

18:49.817 --> 18:52.380
But he was, no doubt.

18:53.963 --> 19:08.624
There were, I mean, you had Stucat, in Stucat, you had Fritz Eggerts, who was famous in, I don't know, during literature.

19:08.644 --> 19:14.132
But also, we had one great, great customer for, you know, books related to Brazil.

19:15.774 --> 19:22.924
He wrote together, now I was, he sold it.

19:23.309 --> 19:26.156
not familiar now, but Maximilian Prince of Peace.

19:27.539 --> 19:42.533
He was a German prince, much interested in anthropology and ethnography, things like that.
