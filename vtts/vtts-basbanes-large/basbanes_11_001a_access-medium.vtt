00:06.325 --> 00:34.442
First of all, I want to... I don't have a recording.

00:35.722 --> 00:46.253
So either the forms of resetting would have been, but I would sort of be ashamed not to let you hear this crusty old New England accent, if you never have.

00:48.095 --> 00:58.166
He's a much better, and I guess they're a much better reader of his poetry inside of us than most poets are.

00:58.286 --> 01:03.872
And I think it gives him a lot of excuses for films that share very much.

01:05.641 --> 01:16.614
Sorry, this is Virgin.

01:16.634 --> 01:19.357
It's in your book.

01:19.757 --> 01:22.741
I think she won't do it.

01:24.242 --> 01:26.084
That's a great poem.

01:26.104 --> 01:34.995
The reason for not doing it is that I assume she's all sort of overworking on you.

01:35.015 --> 01:35.395
Maybe that's all.

01:35.712 --> 01:37.554
Do you not know the boys, Birch's?

01:38.856 --> 01:39.978
I don't.

01:39.998 --> 01:40.358
Oh, okay.

01:40.619 --> 01:42.721
All right, well, follow it in the test there.

01:43.683 --> 01:45.025
Straight in the dark, please.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.090
I like to think some boys have been swinging them.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.475
But swinging those men were down the stairs, I don't do.

01:52.675 --> 01:56.881
Often you must have seen them loaded with ice as they went among me after a rain.

01:57.702 --> 02:05.432
They click upon themselves as the breeze rises and turn in many colors as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.

02:06.644 --> 02:12.150
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells, shattering and avalanching on the snow crust.

02:12.791 --> 02:17.716
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away, you'll think the inner dome of heaven has fallen.

02:18.777 --> 02:22.541
They are dragged to the withered dragon by the load, and they seem not to break.

02:22.781 --> 02:26.405
So once they bowed so low for long, they never write themselves.

02:26.425 --> 02:36.516
You may see their trunks arching in the worst years afterwards, trading their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads, drying the sun.

02:37.458 --> 02:50.588
But I was going to say, when truth broke in with all her matter-of-fact about the ice storm, I should prefer to have some boy, Samson, as he went out or in to fetch the cows, some boy too far from town to learn Bay's law.

02:51.450 --> 02:56.682
But then he played with what he found himself, summer or winter, and could play along.

02:57.505 --> 03:09.723
One by one, he could do these by the streets, by riding them down over and over again, until he took the sickness out of them, and that one was left to conquer.

03:09.743 --> 03:15.632
He went all the way to learn about that money now too soon, and still not carrying the three away, clear the ground.

03:15.952 --> 03:20.299
He always kept his boys to the top branches, climbing carefully.

03:20.319 --> 03:24.525
It was the same pain you used to fill a cup up to the brim and even above the brim.

03:25.079 --> 03:31.645
Then he flung out with feet first with his wish, kicking his way down through the air to his arm.

03:31.665 --> 03:36.289
So was I once myself a swing of a purchase, and so I dream of going back to be.

03:37.370 --> 03:50.401
It's when I'm weary of considerations, and love is too much like a path that's worked where your face burns and tickles with a cobwebs broken across it, and one eye is weeping from the twigs having lashed across it open.

03:50.441 --> 03:54.124
I'd like to get away from us a while,

03:54.931 --> 03:57.213
and then come back to it and begin over.

03:58.675 --> 04:05.603
May no fake willfulness understand me and have brand what I wish and smash me away not to return earth the right place for love.

04:05.623 --> 04:07.445
I don't know where it's like to go better.

04:07.485 --> 04:20.659
I'd like to go by climbing a bird's tree and climb black branches up a snow white trunk toward heaven till the tree could bear no more but fit to stop and set me down again.

04:20.699 --> 04:23.622
That would be good both going and coming back.

04:24.378 --> 04:27.283
One for the worst and is a virtue.

04:38.283 --> 04:53.771
No, I think he probably doesn't think he starts very fast.

04:53.871 --> 04:57.237
You probably don't remember this.

04:57.217 --> 05:02.222
John F. Kennedy inaugurated the president.

05:02.482 --> 05:06.466
You may have seen pictures of this.

05:07.087 --> 05:15.475
He was supposed to recite a poem that had been written for the occasion, but the time that Glennon was so mad, he couldn't read the manuscript.

05:15.495 --> 05:23.103
So he just recited another poem.

05:23.403 --> 05:24.304
What is it?

05:24.942 --> 05:34.395
if he wanted not out claiming the land to get that run.

05:34.416 --> 05:37.720
Everything I've heard of him say has been just like this.

05:37.740 --> 05:38.782
He doesn't waste time.

05:39.983 --> 05:43.068
And they're not slow.

05:43.348 --> 05:48.015
Maybe they're out to waste.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.899
But also, I mean, in some ways that's what it seems to be more like

05:51.065 --> 06:18.273
He was reinterpreting it as he was reading, like more like he was saying, you know, a lot of his stuff that's written about him.

06:18.293 --> 06:19.975
It doesn't make me think he was reading about it, but that he was thinking about it.

06:24.072 --> 06:41.254
Before we just started on this, I want to tell those of you who do, those who do not.

06:41.892 --> 07:00.576
who is uh visiting the college today and uh

07:01.552 --> 07:21.720
He would like to record the class on his recorder, and I asked those people here whether they had an objection to that, and the only objection was that it would be okay as long as he was identified by names.

07:22.021 --> 07:38.342
Do you have any problems with that?

07:39.537 --> 07:47.204
If anybody does have a problem with these points, we've got fighting for something.

07:47.224 --> 07:48.886
That might be the best fight.

07:48.906 --> 07:50.187
He may just want to cut it off.

07:50.267 --> 07:52.570
We don't do that often.

07:52.590 --> 07:58.856
Another thing I would say is that it depends on what the parents would say.

07:59.036 --> 08:03.460
Oh, she never does.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.562
We have a little bit of a fight.

08:05.963 --> 08:34.772
What are you going to do?

08:36.187 --> 08:59.427
Okay

09:03.372 --> 09:18.749
Let us go, then, through the dice, in the evening we spread out against the sky, that the beauty of the eutharized crime clearly.

09:18.769 --> 09:26.157
Let us go to the third and half of the way we speak, and the rain we speak to the rest of the smarts were not as cheap as hell, and the body threw up on his way to hell.

09:27.048 --> 09:42.449
Streets of followers of Stephen Dyson and police intent.

09:42.469 --> 09:44.131
We do have an overwhelming question.

09:44.291 --> 09:47.255
So, can I ask for a reason?

09:47.275 --> 09:48.938
Let's go on in our list.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.621
One of the rings in your nintendo, trouble in the middle of the night.

09:51.641 --> 09:54.185
The little fog is like its back under the lips of pink.

09:54.205 --> 09:55.567
The little smoke has rubbed the mud on the middle of the place.

09:55.587 --> 09:56.548
Let's just turn into the corners of the evening.

09:56.798 --> 10:10.995
Lincoln upon a school's family dream that followed on his back with a tall piece of things.

10:14.039 --> 10:14.860
First slide is there, made a sudden leap.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.422
And seeing there was a stop on silver knife, her arms fell like that.

10:16.442 --> 10:22.349
And believe there will be time, in yellow spots, in the middle of the street, rubbing his back upon the window, becoming worse.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.793
There will be time, there will be time.

10:26.819 --> 10:43.573
Prepare the faith to meet the faith of achieving.

10:43.593 --> 10:49.238
It will be time to murder and create, and time for all the works and days you can, just to get out the question on your plate.

10:49.258 --> 10:49.899
Time for years, and time for me.

10:49.919 --> 10:53.122
And time, yes, for a hundred individuals, and for a hundred individuals, and for a hundred individuals, before the faith of the faith of the faith.

10:53.182 --> 10:55.864
In the rear of the room, in the room, in the room, in the room, in the room, in the room,

10:57.127 --> 11:08.984
And in me, there will be times to wonder, do I dare and do I dare?

11:09.004 --> 11:15.453
Time to turn back and turn this way, it was all spotty over my hair.

11:15.953 --> 11:17.435
They will say, how the hair is growing for me.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.759
No more in hope.

11:20.059 --> 11:21.441
My colors might be growing for me.

11:21.461 --> 11:25.106
My neck tired, rich and modest, and shitted by people's hands.

11:25.126 --> 11:26.408
They will say, but how we own these things.

11:28.396 --> 11:36.644
Do I dare to still be able to?

11:36.664 --> 11:42.570
In minutes, there is time for decisions that are related to just minutes.

11:42.730 --> 11:45.132
But I have known him all already, known him all.

11:45.152 --> 11:48.415
I've known the evenings, mornings, after evenings.

11:48.435 --> 11:52.299
I've measured out my life and coffee experience.

11:52.319 --> 11:55.602
I've known the voices, dimes, about his followers, and he's created through his father's days.

11:56.645 --> 12:00.510
And how should I begin?

12:00.730 --> 12:04.395
For I have known the I's already, known them all.

12:04.415 --> 12:08.420
I was taking you to formulate this place.

12:08.980 --> 12:12.525
And what I have formulated is a strong amount of pain.

12:12.545 --> 12:14.187
And what I am saying is we're doing on the wall.

12:14.347 --> 12:15.008
And how should I begin?

12:15.028 --> 12:18.071
Did I have always got into my days and days?

12:18.091 --> 12:18.552
And how should I begin?

12:19.848 --> 12:32.287
That I've known in the arms that I've known in the hall, arms that are great for me to be there, in the land lights, down to the close down there.

12:32.307 --> 12:39.277
This routine is an address that makes me feel like that.

12:39.297 --> 12:41.701
I'm to lie along with the area that the body shone.

12:41.721 --> 12:42.181
And how should I be me?

12:42.201 --> 12:42.582
And should I be me?

12:44.823 --> 12:57.500
No other arm is effective.

13:00.544 --> 13:07.793
It's remarkable.

13:09.393 --> 13:19.707
Okay, now I want to stop in the woods and it's no easy.

13:19.867 --> 13:25.574
Yeah, but you're both doing the same thing.

13:25.595 --> 13:26.556
Oh, did I?

13:26.576 --> 13:26.676
Yeah.

13:26.696 --> 13:29.420
Oh, I thought you were doing a different one.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.145
No, but, so... You want to go first?

13:33.165 --> 13:38.792
I feel very intimidated after we got caught on his...

13:41.033 --> 13:49.002
You're not going to use your question in the next question.

13:49.022 --> 13:52.105
Much like it during the presentation, I'm not going to lie.

13:53.807 --> 13:55.589
Whose woods these are, I think I know.

13:55.609 --> 13:58.772
I think I was in the middle of a storm.

13:58.792 --> 14:03.377
People I've seen in South East here to watch the woods go up in snow.

14:03.778 --> 14:10.365
By the course, I think it's clear to stop that time has been, keeping wood from the frozen lake, starting at the evening of the year.

14:10.615 --> 14:15.941
He gives his harness belt in shape.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.985
The only other sound is true.

14:21.747 --> 14:23.309
The words are lovely, dark, and neat.

14:23.770 --> 14:27.774
But I can promise it to keep a mile together before I pray.

14:28.415 --> 14:33.060
A mile together before I pray.

14:33.080 --> 14:33.180
Amen.

14:37.514 --> 14:59.347
She gives me that I can tell her, and how she's in the middle of the field, feeling that she's got a clear to what she's willing to say after she's done.

14:59.367 --> 15:02.352
My little boy is not going to say that she's back at that front of her, and she's doing the work she's building over throughout the field every year.

15:02.372 --> 15:04.956
She gives the kind of self a shape to ask her for a kind of shape, feeling that I'm trying to see her in the middle of the field.

15:05.408 --> 15:23.891
Thank you.

15:28.116 --> 15:29.678
What do you think about the business of the course of the life?

15:43.411 --> 15:58.194
Is it difficult to resist the wrong, almost nourish your mind right?

15:58.214 --> 16:04.363
I try to bite that a little bit, but it comes through strongly.

16:06.086 --> 16:07.528
Yeah, A, B, A, B.

16:09.061 --> 16:16.996
Actually, A-A-B-A, B-B-C-B, B-C-B, B-C-B, B-B-B-B.

16:17.156 --> 16:24.811
I was thinking about this one.

16:25.953 --> 16:31.744
But then, I admit all the way here.

16:31.977 --> 16:35.767
Oh, sure.

16:36.509 --> 16:40.761
But it looks to me like that at the end of the line, whose woods these are, I think I know.

16:42.506 --> 16:47.640
Those last three or four syllables are all set.

16:48.751 --> 17:06.788
I read the first two, the first four syllables, whose words be gone, but then I almost feel like I want to say the lesson I think I know, expecting each of those syllables.

17:06.808 --> 17:12.734
It just seems to me that's the way it's written that way, right?

17:12.754 --> 17:15.436
To wonder, would fill up with snow?

17:15.456 --> 17:17.458
I don't, it's not to fill,

17:17.978 --> 17:23.486
to watch these woods fill up with snow, to watch these woods fill up with snow.

17:24.468 --> 17:32.079
If they're all the way away, three or four schools will be stressed, not all the same way.

17:32.099 --> 17:39.030
I think I felt stressed on the end, on the end of the film.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.713
I think I know.

17:40.733 --> 17:44.298
And then there's a lot of things that they brought.

17:44.979 --> 17:46.161
Fill up with snow.

17:46.181 --> 17:46.281
Yeah.

17:46.396 --> 17:52.986
So you think the last two films are probably not good.

17:53.427 --> 17:54.168
Yeah.

17:54.729 --> 18:00.558
And I think it does have... I think I know.

18:00.959 --> 18:08.671
But I think there's a way that you say it.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.016
I think I know.

18:12.037 --> 18:14.260
And... I remember...

18:14.830 --> 18:20.096
.

18:20.116 --> 18:22.860
.

18:26.524 --> 18:30.449
.

18:30.469 --> 18:36.636
.

18:38.422 --> 18:42.508
So my little horse must think it's clear.

18:42.808 --> 18:47.155
You were a trail off in the back.

18:47.175 --> 18:49.598
To stop without a problem.

18:49.658 --> 18:51.721
Stop without a problem.

18:52.102 --> 18:53.204
Stop without a problem.

18:53.825 --> 18:55.247
Stop without a problem.

18:55.347 --> 18:55.807
Stop without a problem.

18:55.827 --> 18:56.028
That's it.

18:56.048 --> 18:57.991
It doesn't mean to be a kind of equal point.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.453
It doesn't mean to be a problem.

18:59.613 --> 19:01.296
It doesn't mean to be a problem.

19:01.316 --> 19:02.337
It doesn't mean to be a problem.

19:02.890 --> 19:29.961
It does seem clear that these

19:31.139 --> 19:50.194
uh the iambic meter which is so strong in the beginning of life tends to break down the end of life

20:02.847 --> 20:03.988
That's what you've got to see.

20:05.611 --> 20:09.235
And you think that's why he's talking here?

20:09.335 --> 20:12.640
For the beauty of the scene.

20:13.120 --> 20:26.998
Do you think that a particular kind of beauty, like I guess when I think of the last stanza, the ones that are lovely, dark, and deep, and ending with the mouth before I stayed, I wonder if it's not just simply beautiful, but

20:26.978 --> 20:31.763
sort of a beauty and subjective position to the fact that he has to continue crunching along.

20:31.803 --> 20:43.216
And there's something about these woods that have some rich, common, sort of beauty that's found like dark and deep.

20:44.017 --> 20:49.864
But if you can think about how it goes, you know, and it's going to be stuck.

20:49.844 --> 21:17.218
So does he for us, and he has promises to see and allows us to understand the effect in which he is

21:17.198 --> 21:21.202
interrupting the course of his everyday journey.

21:26.528 --> 21:37.980
He's almost awakened out of this reverie by the fact that he has to keep going even though he would rather sleep in some sort of passion.

21:38.661 --> 21:41.063
I guess I took that to mean that his reverie

21:41.347 --> 21:57.226
you know, included, you know, in watching the snow, included some sort of sense of, he's sort of wanting to stop from his, from his sort of, you know, plodding along and making it, and that sort of, always going out of the name of the thing.

21:57.246 --> 21:59.749
Yeah, I guess it's like something to do.

21:59.769 --> 22:01.711
I just really wanted to do something.

22:01.731 --> 22:02.693
I don't know if you want to do something.

22:02.713 --> 22:04.214
I don't know if you want to do something.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.059
I don't know if you want to do something.

22:08.079 --> 22:08.920
I don't know if you want to do something.

22:08.940 --> 22:09.801
I don't know if you want to do something.

22:10.642 --> 22:15.631
Do you think that doesn't mean anticipation?

22:15.651 --> 22:20.160
Yeah, it might be anticipation, but it doesn't seem impossible.

22:20.180 --> 22:22.144
But anyway, at least right now.

22:22.164 --> 22:24.288
Yeah, but he has promises to choose.

22:24.308 --> 22:27.013
He's got those promises to be promised.

22:27.517 --> 22:55.313
It is all the sort of paradoxical risk that

22:55.293 --> 23:01.319
The concept of the last line is saying, you know, I've got to keep going.

23:01.920 --> 23:10.829
But the feel of it, the repetition, the rhyme, the rhythm, all contributes to almost all of my life's feeling.

23:10.889 --> 23:17.576
My wife told me that her mother used to recite this to her when she was a little girl at bedtime.

23:18.477 --> 23:21.840
That's sort of like a lullaby.

23:21.820 --> 23:38.749
which is very interesting i think but there's i think that there's thematically there's something close to the sense of motion the darkest evening of the year

23:38.729 --> 23:45.261
And that line comes exactly halfway through the poem.

23:45.983 --> 23:47.886
So there's this sense of suspension.

23:48.347 --> 23:56.282
So at least we have an image of him suspended in this moment watching the snowfall and stopping.

23:56.262 --> 24:06.034
what the significance of that suspension is, that one would take the approach at the solstice, perhaps a moment, and it would stop one's motion.

24:07.015 --> 24:08.697
I don't know.

24:08.717 --> 24:14.063
I mean, it's not that he considers anything other than .

24:14.083 --> 24:18.709
I think it's right that he's distributing the thought to the law.

24:19.212 --> 24:38.638
the thought of that standard that the little horse must keep it clear to stop without a bar happening between the woods and the first place to guard the future so all of that is the thought of the little horse oh yeah

24:38.618 --> 24:57.697
And you're projecting that over to the Lord.

24:58.718 --> 25:06.145
Thank you.

25:07.373 --> 25:14.607
That's a lone wolf, a really more believable, has originated in horses.

25:14.627 --> 25:20.238
That is the horse, by shaking and letting it go.

25:20.258 --> 25:26.169
And of course horses can be in pictures like that.

25:26.189 --> 25:29.095
I don't know what you see as this is stopping that the horse is going to go on.

25:29.513 --> 25:51.994
The driver, the speaker,

25:53.257 --> 26:05.812
isn't sensitive to sort of the frightening aspects of the environment.

26:06.593 --> 26:21.610
I think I appreciate that the sort of darkness and the coldness for the speakers who seem to be in some sort of peace or calm or a reminder of

26:21.978 --> 26:42.980
They need to keep on going on.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.101
Okay?

26:43.121 --> 26:49.167
I think I'm sure what I think about the idea of the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being.

26:49.147 --> 27:18.445
right right yeah i don't i mean i agree with you that but due to the fact that as a whole

27:18.425 --> 27:34.224
And it comes, you know, halfway through the poem.

27:35.786 --> 27:43.856
It adds some sort of weight to that impression.

27:43.876 --> 27:47.841
I think it also, too, I have a hard time

27:48.665 --> 28:12.107
I have a hard time to think about it, but if I think about it, I have a hard time to think about it

28:13.268 --> 28:38.078
it couldn't could it be enough that it's beautiful yeah but could it could it be could it meaning be simply in its beauty rather than something that it's significant no

28:38.311 --> 28:38.912
No.

28:39.253 --> 28:41.819
I find it sentimental in that case.

28:41.859 --> 28:42.801
I find it sentimental, period.

28:43.222 --> 28:54.347
But if what you think is true, right, that there isn't this kind of thing, I forget, it seems to be suggested, right?

28:55.229 --> 28:56.792
What about that?

28:56.772 --> 29:25.665
and what if the 17 years experience and focus on the content of some of the lucky or i guess mythical and not the fault of his work to why he's stopping

29:25.645 --> 29:31.403
That's nice, and I'm happy for him, and I've been living at home.

29:32.767 --> 29:55.640
So those who are from the old, you can see the same way of sharing it.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.723
So if you say what I was asking about, I don't know, but I don't know if that's what I'm talking about.

29:57.743 --> 29:58.584
But I think that's what I'm talking about.

29:58.604 --> 29:59.365
I think that's what I'm talking about.

29:59.345 --> 30:16.408
Again, I feel

30:16.844 --> 30:45.417
more connection to this which I do read as a personal poem than I do to say the very philosophical systemic sort of thing we found in Yates where you can dig for years and have hours worth of conversations about the philosophical import but

30:45.802 --> 30:50.833
I find this a better poem.

30:51.434 --> 31:02.920
I think I want to say that I'm very clear to you that there is not that medical now in finding these words, but the way that there is is in this.

31:02.940 --> 31:03.962
But my question is

31:06.187 --> 31:25.917
what is the personal meaning

31:26.116 --> 31:41.661
so it's not necessarily referring to some

31:42.164 --> 31:53.270
One thing I found out is what was a little bit easier for me.

31:53.711 --> 31:56.077
E.I.

31:56.418 --> 32:00.848
spent three months to describe how beautiful the word is.

32:00.828 --> 32:12.146
In the rest of the poem, the Ademai is not to describe what he has seen.

32:13.789 --> 32:23.785
He has seen what's happening.

32:23.986 --> 32:27.932
The other rest of the poem is

32:28.283 --> 32:37.770
his pain or form of the procession, and then he does.

32:38.223 --> 33:02.104
What do you think about the question?

33:02.084 --> 33:16.287
Behind that is really a tension between men of studying capacities and between the more practical research.

33:16.307 --> 33:23.198
There is a way to represent the more practical research and the more practical research and the more practical research and the more practical research and the more practical research.

33:23.178 --> 33:41.828
even though this is

33:41.808 --> 34:00.118
But all he says, of course, the first thing you've heard is that the court doesn't understand why to stop it.

34:00.539 --> 34:08.372
The second thing he learned is that he doesn't try to save the past if they were from the state.

34:08.352 --> 34:18.644
So the horse doesn't understand whatever is possible for a poet in an aesthetic moment.

34:18.944 --> 34:27.554
I guess I'm not wholly convinced about utilitarian versus aesthetic for just a couple of reasons.

34:27.574 --> 34:33.280
First of all, what Mr. Hsu mentioned is that aesthetic really isn't made that much.

34:33.563 --> 34:36.507
that's mostly the art of your sobbing.

34:36.647 --> 34:59.099
And secondly, the aesthetic character takes off in a particular, I mean, I guess I was just reading that it was a particular kind of aesthetic or the aesthetic quality, I think you might even be able to say possibly, I don't know if this is right, but one of the reasons why the Lord is aesthetically pleasing is because it, well, precisely because he's tired.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.165
And you know, if he wasn't tired, he wouldn't be,

35:03.145 --> 35:04.628
he wouldn't be enraptured.

35:04.648 --> 35:21.502
And I would say, if I wanted to make some sort of, my definition would be between sticking fast and persisting as opposed to feeling tired or being, I don't want to say just tired.

35:21.522 --> 35:23.145
I think that the aesthetic component

35:23.125 --> 35:27.891
is really important.

35:28.071 --> 35:37.062
I don't know how it would start.

35:37.323 --> 35:46.534
I don't understand how you would count these audits to stop me in the background.

35:46.514 --> 35:54.228
I didn't explain to you, but it turned out to be yourself.

35:54.248 --> 35:56.136
And it turned out, yeah, it's a beautiful, or it's just...

35:56.369 --> 36:26.376
stay there and watch me for a long time but i don't i don't think you're not presenting with any motivation and stairs for stopping since we're only presenting his results he will not be stopping here to watch his work i know i'm stopping to watch i know this is that i don't see i'm not sure how else do you want like he won't have to be stopping here explicitly to watch this

36:26.356 --> 36:52.937
i don't know but it doesn't seem to me that

36:52.917 --> 37:10.233
We are presented in such a clear organization as in today's studies and moving on forward with that.

37:10.253 --> 37:18.440
It seems to be inspecting the individual land, you know.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.924
What does it matter to land?

37:22.904 --> 37:26.529
Why did he ask?

37:27.190 --> 37:28.111
Why did he wonder?

37:28.512 --> 37:29.273
Or what did he say?

37:29.934 --> 37:31.196
Who would these are?

37:31.236 --> 37:32.718
I don't know.

37:33.379 --> 37:36.723
Why did he bring that up?

37:37.164 --> 37:44.254
I think it's important that he doesn't want to be true.

37:44.234 --> 37:51.343
.

37:51.363 --> 38:12.030
But there's the same question of .

38:12.010 --> 38:17.859
I thought you were trying to do something.

38:21.545 --> 38:24.410
This is a beautiful place.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.954
People don't live here.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.737
They just live somewhere else.

38:28.717 --> 38:37.107
Maybe I thought there was something like people didn't get stopped or how people were treated.

38:37.808 --> 38:51.405
So I thought that was also the reason he felt people will, or maybe horses will, question why he stopped.

38:51.425 --> 38:52.066
Thank you.

38:52.086 --> 38:53.087
People didn't get there.

38:53.540 --> 38:57.564
Is that perfectly known as that?

38:57.584 --> 39:02.348
If people were there and wouldn't be a student?

39:02.829 --> 39:05.592
And you wouldn't have the sense of isolation.

39:05.612 --> 39:13.980
And if there were a bar in our community, then you wouldn't have the tension that Ms.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.441
Lord referred to.

39:15.461 --> 39:21.707
You would have other sounds besides the heart spells and sneak an easy way to go down its way.

39:21.957 --> 39:33.793
in order to be able to understand what they're talking about.

39:33.853 --> 39:41.824
Yeah, but that doesn't answer the question of why conventions build with people who don't do a home for their work.

39:42.105 --> 39:49.635
I think it's a question of the mind and of the earth for sure, but it seems to me it's not a question of the beauty of the place at all, it's a question of the stopping and the feeling of others or they're not being seen

39:49.615 --> 40:06.903
is what's important to us.

40:06.923 --> 40:10.288
So that he doesn't, he doesn't have a great effect on either of the staff.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.292
I'm not sure how I'm going to say it.

40:12.312 --> 40:13.193
If you have a question, I don't.

40:13.612 --> 40:35.890
You're talking about going out in the snow in a way to

40:36.680 --> 40:38.327
It's bleeds in the dark.

40:38.347 --> 40:47.483
Well, I don't know if there's anything that's particular, but in the repetition, you've got promises to keep.

40:48.172 --> 40:52.117
It looks like I can't read that.

40:53.339 --> 41:11.763
I've had a lot of promises, a lot of things that have to be done before I can... Well, I said earlier about the darkness, the sort of black and white world that you see here.

41:11.783 --> 41:15.968
I remember, darkness is near and there, down the plain.

41:16.640 --> 41:21.607
I think it's not too far to say, to identify that with death.

41:22.909 --> 41:29.799
I mean, assuming that he would want to, say, sleep in the woods, I mean, I think that death would be a natural.

41:31.361 --> 41:36.769
So I think, you know, by, you know, saying suicide, I think that would make it a little too proactive.

41:36.829 --> 41:43.238
I think I agree that, you know, there would be, it would either be A, or B, he would, you know,

41:43.218 --> 42:00.106
I guess I would want to join the topic, mainly he wants to specifically seek propose in beauty or something like that, with death perhaps being the necessary consequence, but not really the end.

42:00.607 --> 42:09.141
I definitely just don't necessarily see him specifically aiming for death per se.

42:09.408 --> 42:22.193
When you said suicide, you're thinking to die, sleep, chance to dream.

42:22.213 --> 42:30.068
I was really just thinking about him in his life.

42:30.228 --> 42:31.230
And he stopped here.

42:31.210 --> 42:36.717
Deliverably because he knows there is nobody around.

42:36.817 --> 42:41.703
Even though he knows who he belongs to, he's got to do it.

42:43.725 --> 42:44.706
There's nobody there.

42:44.887 --> 42:48.211
The Lord can understand why he stopped.

42:48.231 --> 42:50.013
And presumably no one else knew what he was there.

42:50.353 --> 42:53.337
He didn't just look at the robbery, he wasn't.

42:53.317 --> 42:59.667
He certainly does like to continue to see, and he makes a beautiful horror.

42:59.687 --> 43:08.862
But the ending on that repetitive note, the but in that third answer again, what is a lovely art in Jesus Christ.

43:09.112 --> 43:27.520
Why?

43:27.540 --> 43:27.660
Sorry.

43:27.640 --> 43:46.609
Okay.

43:46.629 --> 43:46.729
Okay.

43:47.047 --> 43:54.139
I don't know.

43:54.740 --> 43:57.805
I was worried about that.

43:57.825 --> 44:05.618
But the thing is, I don't sense any remorse in this class.

44:06.159 --> 44:08.683
That's one thing that I read about .

44:08.663 --> 44:34.350
I don't know if this is really important or not, but I think one tactical that everybody could see is that

44:34.330 --> 44:45.988
He ran all the lines, he put the third line in every sample.

44:46.008 --> 44:55.883
And he took the third line and ran that last word, made that the line to the next sample.

44:55.863 --> 45:05.926
So when we got to the last one, what did he do except what he said he'd be like?

45:05.946 --> 45:14.867
Well, I'm sure there isn't a context, but he just chose a different form if he found a dissatisfying way.

45:14.847 --> 45:28.246
I don't think that means we have to come to a conclusion.

45:28.266 --> 45:29.008
I don't know.

45:29.188 --> 45:39.082
I don't think NYU would necessarily have to go to Washington.

45:39.102 --> 45:40.704
And I don't know.

45:40.725 --> 45:41.766
It's quite possible that .

45:42.050 --> 45:55.501
I'm really wondering about what the snow means for them.

45:55.521 --> 45:59.385
Because I know the snow oftentimes is for us, making that feel.

45:59.545 --> 46:11.955
And the whole world seems to still, I mean, I was wondering if somebody is about the snow and what the snow means, and how does that make sense?

46:12.256 --> 46:34.155
It seems like it's not an active, active social environment, isn't it?

46:34.175 --> 46:36.880
And it seems like maybe it's going to be looking for some kind of balance between these words of what you have.

46:37.788 --> 46:49.221
I'm not sure that this is really sounded.

46:50.022 --> 47:00.855
It sounded like I felt at the end because it was a piece.

47:01.055 --> 47:03.778
So that's why it somehow wasn't

47:04.838 --> 47:16.242
You have found something to counterbalance that you need to grab, even though I'm in a region.

47:16.262 --> 47:17.785
You know, it's about, it's about, you feel it's about you.

47:19.199 --> 47:35.346
I think that the point of the call has to get out of it.

47:35.366 --> 47:38.331
Yeah, but it's kind of... ...to incentivize, to get out of it.

47:38.351 --> 47:41.055
And the word promises itself is a word that doesn't involve the same imagination as something like allocation.

47:41.035 --> 47:45.500
It sounded very happy.

47:45.521 --> 48:02.021
And the fact that the sex animal said in the last one that you see is that it seems to be an affirmation of something that is there and I'm happy to go on.

48:02.041 --> 48:03.803
It seems somehow energetic that he throws down

48:03.783 --> 48:25.251
I think there's a sense of

48:25.619 --> 48:26.823
I am going to go on.

48:27.525 --> 48:33.023
These are my promises, my obligations.

48:33.364 --> 48:38.802
But I think there is a part of him still, even in those lines,

48:39.102 --> 48:41.565
that wants to sleep.

48:42.166 --> 48:47.494
He is actively overcoming that, but I wouldn't say he's joyful.

48:48.075 --> 48:57.668
What if there is a difference?

48:57.648 --> 49:07.071
I mean, I can't do that.

49:07.813 --> 49:13.767
And then the last one was a kind of falling back.

49:13.747 --> 49:25.379
I guess, how do you read those two lasting lines?

49:25.399 --> 49:35.109
I mean, just like reading, like rhythmically, how do you read them?

49:35.129 --> 49:37.432
How would you say them?

49:37.532 --> 49:38.893
Yeah, how would you say them?

49:39.025 --> 49:51.402
That's more upbeat than I think it's been read today.

49:51.622 --> 49:54.666
Even that strikes me as really weird.

49:55.167 --> 50:03.919
It seems that you're pushing the proactive and energetic.

50:04.574 --> 50:26.734
I mean, it could be that he just did a bad job, say, rhythmically, you know, allowing the rhythm with the words or something like Earthless Sense, but it's, I mean, it strikes me that the rhythm plus the fact that you have, but, you know, even though there is this kind of tells on me, but I must do this, coupled with the rhythm, I mean, I guess I just,

50:27.389 --> 50:37.921
I'm really having a difficult time reading that, anything other than it's a little bit weird.

50:38.342 --> 50:42.887
I mean, that's not really a hard test that I'm thinking of.

50:42.907 --> 50:43.828
I don't know.

50:43.848 --> 50:56.383
It seems to me that if you were so excited, if you were so weird, you wouldn't be able to say it's like,

50:57.106 --> 51:07.386
I think that...

51:08.632 --> 51:33.930
like it's it seems to be some sort of family to be able to say to yourself or to um

51:33.910 --> 51:42.203
But I don't know, I might be wrong with it.

51:42.784 --> 51:44.447
Before Ms.

51:44.787 --> 51:54.282
Nuna brought up the suicide issue, I thought the discussion before that was kind of...

51:54.616 --> 52:05.369
I don't know why we're suddenly trying to interpret it as a component of this kind of thought.

52:05.389 --> 52:14.821
At the beginning, you can live as a lot of art to read to the children.

52:15.241 --> 52:19.847
To me, the reason is very...

52:20.536 --> 52:23.703
clear and also very straightforward.

52:24.766 --> 52:34.107
It seems to me it's hard for me to read it as something, contemplating that, because how can someone stop reading it?

52:34.255 --> 53:01.275
I find that even using the word suicide is just really too, I guess, distracting because it keeps on making it sound as if

53:01.255 --> 53:19.795
I mean, I don't know about other people, but like violent or proactive or something like that, where it just, I mean, it doesn't, I mean, the proactive part is him continuing, though I think that it's not a, that it's not a, you know, it's not really a happy proactive, where there is something positive.

53:19.915 --> 53:29.305
I mean, I think that your time will say that there is something that joins you and keeps you going as a positive thing, but nonetheless being aware very strongly of

53:29.285 --> 53:50.736
um the fact that you're tired there's one way to go these people close i especially think that considering the fact that the last you know couple of lines are really i think i think anyway sort of rhythmically slow it's like it you know while he's actually watching you know snow things are you know it's it's a good and you know sort of relaxed but

53:50.716 --> 53:56.894
you know, must be realized, but, you know, I promise.

53:56.914 --> 53:59.682
Especially the last one, I could straighten it a lot.

53:59.742 --> 54:03.392
You're right, if you don't extend that punctuation at the end of every mile,

54:03.980 --> 54:06.043
And that slows you down.

54:06.945 --> 54:09.228
I'd really like to get that straight, by the way.

54:09.468 --> 54:25.313
I don't know if everyone else has a third edition, but I was wondering, like, the punctuation in this edition, there's no end stop of any sort in my third edition, nor in my sixth, where I've got to believe there's something.

54:25.850 --> 54:26.911
I mean, I don't know.

54:27.892 --> 54:35.561
This edition has a comma at line 13, a lovely comma.

54:35.681 --> 54:41.828
But line, at the second stage, the only punctuation is the end of it.

54:42.069 --> 54:44.651
That's surprising.

54:44.672 --> 54:44.812
Really?

54:44.832 --> 54:46.874
Okay.

54:46.914 --> 54:49.577
Does someone have the actual draw?

54:49.597 --> 54:53.882
I don't think we can tell them this.

54:53.947 --> 55:00.666
Let's go.

55:01.051 --> 55:09.483
Suggesting textual problems.

55:09.523 --> 55:24.544
What's the difference?

55:24.794 --> 55:34.171
Maybe it's a good time for a new reform.

55:34.652 --> 55:48.456
Who'd like to read this one?

55:49.145 --> 55:59.078
What's your question?

55:59.678 --> 56:01.821
Right.

56:01.961 --> 56:02.322
Okay.

56:02.462 --> 56:04.604
Okay.

56:05.566 --> 56:08.189
Anybody?

56:10.792 --> 56:12.975
Yeah.

56:13.293 --> 56:16.518
The people along the sand, I'll turn and look one way.

56:17.159 --> 56:19.682
They turn their back in their hands.

56:19.702 --> 56:21.705
They look at speed all day.

56:21.725 --> 56:25.070
As long as it takes to pass, it just keeps raising its own.

56:25.090 --> 56:29.056
The wetter ground, like glass, or fresh descending doors.

56:29.076 --> 56:32.902
The land may hear the more, but what are the truth they need?

56:32.922 --> 56:36.327
The water comes to shore, and the people look at speed.

56:36.347 --> 56:39.251
They can't look at parts, they can't look at peace.

56:39.271 --> 56:42.456
The wind is better than the bark, and the rock's taking the heat.

56:48.072 --> 57:02.958
The question came up before we even started about this question.

57:03.318 --> 57:08.848
It's not only simple but ugly.

57:12.355 --> 57:30.499
I would suggest that fraud is accessible on many different levels that you can

57:30.479 --> 57:35.250
read and understand something immediately.

57:35.411 --> 57:44.392
There is an important level of reading that you read it and you get it.

57:44.412 --> 57:45.535
But it doesn't end there.

57:46.072 --> 57:55.022
I think that you can have a profitable discussion dealing both formally and in terms of content.

57:55.042 --> 57:59.927
Not necessarily philosophically, although there's some problems.

57:59.947 --> 58:05.233
I think we might have much more philosophical discussion than some of those .

58:06.995 --> 58:15.724
But I think that can be approached on many different models in a way that, say,

58:16.396 --> 58:36.726
Elliott is not very accessible at the first reading.

58:36.786 --> 58:42.955
Thank you.

58:43.776 --> 58:46.200
Thank you.

58:49.657 --> 58:56.390
I think you're right that it is very accessible.

58:56.690 --> 59:03.102
And I think it's accessible on many levels.

59:03.122 --> 59:06.248
And the immediate accessibility is not necessarily .

59:06.228 --> 59:13.737
And the fact that it's accessible to the writers of people, I don't think, makes a difference.

59:13.757 --> 59:19.564
But I mean, it's part of that sense to choose the fact that it's poetry.

59:19.584 --> 59:28.494
That just because it's poetry, I may think it's accessible by a variety of moments, when in fact, it's not.

59:28.514 --> 59:33.720
I mean, what I mean by that is in prose, for example,

59:34.426 --> 59:45.803
i'm looking for something to read the other day i picked up power forward

59:46.593 --> 59:55.988
Now, it seems, I'm pretty confident saying, well, some prose just doesn't type, and I'm seeing that, some prose just doesn't do it.

59:56.008 --> 01:00:06.525
Why should I be able to believe that some poetry that just doesn't do it, in fact, does have accessibility on the line?

01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:10.513
For some, for an individual.

01:00:10.533 --> 01:00:12.156
What do you mean?

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:17.127
You wouldn't like me reading it if you were reading a book or something?

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:17.628
Oh, absolutely.

01:00:18.389 --> 01:00:19.972
I would read this stuff for days.

01:00:20.393 --> 01:00:21.736
You know what?

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:23.299
I'm not sure.

01:00:23.937 --> 01:00:31.725
I've never been sure what to make of that.

01:00:32.246 --> 01:00:38.612
Like, I've never been sure what to make of that.

01:00:38.632 --> 01:00:47.121
Like, I've never known what to make of it because it's clear to me that it means something that's really important to a lot of other people.

01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:47.681
What do you mean?

01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:48.722
Because I thought you'd choose the wrong.

01:00:48.742 --> 01:00:49.303
No, no, no, no, no.
