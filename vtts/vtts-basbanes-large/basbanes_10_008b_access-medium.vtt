WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.582
I do believe now we're recording in the other direction.

00:08.143 --> 00:09.584
Yep.

00:09.604 --> 00:10.425
Great little machine.

00:11.947 --> 00:14.369
You talk to Marzi, you talk to Wong.

00:15.230 --> 00:17.552
And we'll get Corbis in there, and that'll be the end of that.

00:20.335 --> 00:24.960
But then, and of course they make the CDs, didn't they?

00:25.300 --> 00:34.189
And they made that fancy little thing they call a codec-scope.

00:34.709 --> 00:39.193
studying the codex, the Lester codex, that Bill Gates paid $30 million for.

00:40.314 --> 00:48.762
You know, Bill Gates's library on the one hand, and Bill Gates's digital paintings.

00:49.583 --> 00:53.726
Umberto Eco on the concept of fakes and originals.

00:55.148 --> 01:02.995
The quote from Foucault's Pendulum about then, when the original is gone, the next copy is the original.

01:04.223 --> 01:05.124
There's a lot there.

01:07.246 --> 01:08.707
Maybe this is the place to do it.

01:10.048 --> 01:11.790
And again, it's part of the book arts.

01:12.571 --> 01:12.911
Paper.

01:14.493 --> 01:15.333
Is this where we're going?

01:16.515 --> 01:17.516
People who still do it.

01:18.777 --> 01:22.000
And it's going to be fast and clean and being clean.

01:22.901 --> 01:25.583
And it's going to be done quickly.

01:25.603 --> 01:27.165
I can't do a whole ton of interviews.

01:27.705 --> 01:28.986
We do this like a magazine piece.

01:29.967 --> 01:32.770
Like a magazine article.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.011
So now we've got the book arts.

01:35.594 --> 01:37.776
Book people, book places, book culture.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.578
Is there a place for Cleveland here?

01:41.741 --> 01:42.261
I hope so.

01:42.802 --> 01:43.362
I hope so.

01:43.783 --> 01:46.446
Or we can work it in various places.

01:46.466 --> 01:51.471
It is a Midwestern city that seems to do, and it's Ohio.

01:52.032 --> 01:56.417
And, you know, maybe here you can bring in OCLC, Middle America.

01:57.878 --> 02:02.243
Garrett Hunter, OCLC, LexisNexis.

02:03.218 --> 02:15.571
Western Reserve, Cleveland Public Library, the Rofont Club, the collectors, who I don't have to profile to any great extent, but the book culture of Cleveland.

02:15.611 --> 02:16.773
Just call that book culture.

02:18.494 --> 02:19.095
Book culture.

02:20.897 --> 02:23.039
Cleveland, Ohio, book culture from a Cleveland.

02:25.001 --> 02:27.043
And then maybe you can really express that phrase.

02:27.064 --> 02:31.268
You can really develop that idea of book culture in a community.

02:31.940 --> 02:39.852
Using Cleveland as a case study, as a place where books still matter to a great extent.

02:43.718 --> 02:44.159
I like it.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.622
Boy, I don't know how many we've got now.

02:50.148 --> 02:50.869
Very evil.

02:51.570 --> 02:52.211
Destruction.

02:56.297 --> 03:00.343
Well, how about in the National Libraries?

03:03.378 --> 03:04.940
How about in the national libraries?

03:08.243 --> 03:10.345
That is a national library, and it's still there.

03:10.365 --> 03:11.866
It's a halt, and it was destroyed.

03:14.529 --> 03:16.651
The efforts that Andras Riedelmeyer has made.

03:16.671 --> 03:20.655
So I think we will do that.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.197
Why don't we do that?

03:23.237 --> 03:26.460
That'll be the penultimate chapter.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.465
It'll be discreet.

03:31.485 --> 03:32.366
It'll be small.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.267
It'll be tight.

03:34.968 --> 03:40.496
And then we'll go straight from Sarajevo, which is present and future.

03:41.979 --> 03:44.182
And as the millennium approaches, it's still a hulk.

03:45.524 --> 03:50.732
And then we flash to the National Library.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.915
So let's insert Sarajevo in right there.

03:57.101 --> 03:57.522
Right there.

03:58.103 --> 03:58.543
That's good.

03:59.044 --> 04:00.306
And that's your Continuum II.

04:01.788 --> 04:03.591
That's your Continuum II chapter.

04:05.174 --> 04:11.863
Attack on Memory is prior to that Continuum II.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.629
And, you know, we haven't discussed the Emigre Libraries, have we?

04:18.733 --> 04:19.955
Jeez, that's so important.

04:23.139 --> 04:24.721
The library in Venice.

04:27.866 --> 04:34.675
The library in Paris that served as the library for... Well, you know, why not in the National Libraries?

04:37.253 --> 04:42.020
Again, we're talking about culture and heritage and archives.

04:42.781 --> 04:49.070
And we have formal repositories and informal de facto, de facto repositories.

04:51.513 --> 04:52.835
And so they can go in right there.

04:54.698 --> 04:58.203
Together or in tandem.

04:58.223 --> 04:58.763
But together.

04:59.404 --> 04:59.945
But together.

05:01.327 --> 05:06.214
And so let's see, just so we don't forget, we mentioned San Lazaro in Venice.

05:06.346 --> 05:26.774
the Armenian Library, the Georgian Papers, which Harvard just returned to the newly re-established Republic of Georgia, Poland, and Cambodia, which Cornell is working on.

05:29.377 --> 05:35.205
And we either do Cambodia when we do Cornell or we do

05:35.573 --> 05:36.574
Cambodia here.

05:36.815 --> 05:38.036
We'll just have to decide.

05:42.502 --> 05:43.383
We'll have to decide.

05:43.403 --> 05:45.046
We'll have to write it and see how it goes.

05:47.549 --> 05:51.234
So I think we could have anywhere from 10 to a dozen chapters there.

05:55.179 --> 06:00.727
And Gentle Madness, which had 14, we've got a prologue, and then we will have an epilogue.

06:01.508 --> 06:03.370
And the epilogue will be...

06:03.974 --> 06:17.691
As I indicated at the top of this monologue, in Alexandria, on the site of the Great Library, not far from the White House, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

06:19.553 --> 06:25.200
And here, as a beacon to the next millennium, is being built a modern library.

06:26.161 --> 06:29.806
And I have to get information from John Cole on that and from UNESCO on that.

06:30.427 --> 06:33.070
And we don't want to forget the preservation stuff

06:33.809 --> 06:37.935
that we saw at Leipzig, and that's part of the German program.

06:38.076 --> 06:46.569
We can talk about what LC's doing with preservation and brittle books, and what LC's doing when it goes off-site on the Harvard model.

06:46.809 --> 06:49.794
Apparently, there's a videotape that we want to see on the Harvard model.

06:54.661 --> 06:59.749
And I think what you've got there, Nicholas, is a complete book.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.964
And I'm going to listen to this when I get home.

07:07.307 --> 07:09.109
And as I listen to it, maybe I'll take some notes.

07:11.111 --> 07:18.139
And I've just passed through Hartford, so I know I've been talking for close to an hour and a half.

07:18.159 --> 07:23.985
It usually takes me 65 minutes to do this part of the trip between Boston and New York.

07:24.686 --> 07:32.014
But because I haven't really gone over 45 minutes an hour, and I've kind of lost track of the time, but it's been a wonderful way to pass the time.

07:33.445 --> 07:39.051
And now I'm past Hartford and I'm within an hour of being home and I need gas pretty soon.

07:39.071 --> 07:43.996
And if anything else comes up, I'll just go ahead and turn this thing on.

07:44.016 --> 07:55.908
So, I do encourage you when you get home to take a look at your notebook from New York because a lot of new things came our way.

07:57.590 --> 08:01.714
We were talking about the book arts, Terry Belanger.

08:02.251 --> 08:11.660
We also want to talk about library schools and that fellow that we met last night at our lectures.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.344
We've got to find a place for a library school.

08:17.266 --> 08:22.391
Possibly, possibly, in paradigm lost, paradigm regained.

08:27.636 --> 08:29.338
That's the fellow I've got to talk to.

08:31.158 --> 08:42.796
And on Book Odds, the nice guy that gave a talk at the Houghton Library on the George Parker Winship address.

08:44.218 --> 08:45.860
A guy from New York.

08:45.880 --> 08:46.862
I met him again last night.

08:46.982 --> 08:48.144
He's in book design.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.589
You want to mention Bibliography Week, too.

08:51.689 --> 08:53.151
It goes on in Bibliography Week.

08:53.171 --> 08:55.054
We'll tell you what Bibliography Week is all about.

08:55.735 --> 09:00.102
Jean Ashton said she would talk to me when this guy is finally sentenced.

09:01.651 --> 09:04.294
They're stealing the stuff.

09:04.314 --> 09:12.885
Jean Ashton also, incidentally, by the way, her concept of medium rare for books, kind of fun for preservation.

09:12.905 --> 09:17.671
Remember Don Riggs at the University of Michigan who said the just-in-case books?

09:17.691 --> 09:18.872
Five years, the plan.

09:19.813 --> 09:27.743
Don't forget that Cornell is under orders from its trustees to go from 6.8 million books to 5 million books.

09:28.769 --> 09:34.955
Mark Divination is leaving Cornell to go to the Library of Congress.

09:36.256 --> 09:40.661
Bill Stoneman has left the Scheide Library to go to the Houghton Library.

09:40.681 --> 09:46.126
And Paul Needham, we learned today, is going from Sotheby's to the Scheide Library.

09:48.168 --> 09:50.991
Interesting stuff.

09:51.011 --> 09:55.795
Very, very interesting stuff.

09:55.815 --> 09:58.658
We just want to be alert to these things when we write them up.

09:59.431 --> 10:05.997
I may have failed to mention Fratering Gregorian, Paul Leclerc.

10:06.758 --> 10:08.379
These are people that I've interviewed.

10:11.102 --> 10:12.303
They're all part of the mix.

10:15.566 --> 10:16.307
Fred Schreiber.

10:20.671 --> 10:25.776
And when I was doing the booksellers, did I mention Herbert Tinsert?

10:25.796 --> 10:26.957
I certainly hope I did.

10:28.102 --> 10:29.486
Glastonberg and Stern.

10:31.651 --> 10:35.782
So you just want to think of all these people.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.351
Go through your notes, go through your tapes, see where they apply.

10:40.755 --> 10:43.562
Okay, this is Nick out for the moment.
