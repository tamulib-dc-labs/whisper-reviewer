WEBVTT

00:04.385 --> 00:06.468
It should be returning.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.333
It's already going in the other direction now.

00:12.675 --> 00:31.017
The best of all collections of any library or private individual on the subject of Cyphers and Codes, including William F. Friedman, who gave his collection to the John Marshall Library.

00:31.267 --> 00:34.292
He didn't collect the early books like the famous and the others.

00:34.332 --> 00:38.058
He didn't have the money on his salary working for the army.

00:38.078 --> 00:41.804
And he told me himself, you know, he's only collecting the modern books.

00:41.965 --> 00:43.086
That's all he could afford.

00:43.948 --> 00:49.377
How do postcards and boys' stories, how does all this fit into your scheme?

00:49.597 --> 00:51.300
You said there's a method in your madness.

00:52.175 --> 00:54.538
How do postcards?

00:54.558 --> 01:04.330
Well, I concentrated mostly on postcards with views of New York City and different boroughs and Coney Island and so on.

01:04.350 --> 01:20.629
And I broke them down into different classifications, famous hotels, the Hotel Aston and Hotel Walden and the Astoria and so on, and streets and so forth.

01:20.947 --> 01:24.916
So being it's a subject collection.

01:24.936 --> 01:27.100
That should be very interesting given here, a public library.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.223
They went right into U.S.

01:28.243 --> 01:29.967
history, local history, and genealogy.

01:29.987 --> 01:31.069
Alphabet, graphic art.

01:31.209 --> 01:31.831
Absolutely.

01:31.871 --> 01:32.693
They have a collection.

01:32.793 --> 01:40.710
And it's really hard for us to be scouring individually to go out and find, you know, or to develop something like...

01:40.960 --> 01:45.826
We could only do one thing or another, but David is like an adult.

01:45.866 --> 01:48.289
He's somebody doing what we do, and he's helping.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.351
And he's got a specialty.

01:49.371 --> 01:50.592
And he researches it.

01:50.813 --> 01:54.718
He finds out more about it, and then he knows what to buy.

01:54.738 --> 02:09.617
In relation to postcards, I joined a postcard club here in New York City, and I attended all the meetings, and I told the other dealers what I was looking for, and I go through their stock to figure out

02:09.884 --> 02:11.767
interesting views in New York City.

02:11.847 --> 02:14.271
I've got a postcard collection that you've done nuts over.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.897
You've heard of Francis Henry Taylor, who was the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

02:18.658 --> 02:21.803
And then he came back to Worcester, which is where I was, and he died up there.

02:22.644 --> 02:24.547
And he had 4,500 postcards.

02:24.667 --> 02:25.849
He's all over.

02:25.869 --> 02:30.036
Whenever he was going off to buy art in Met, he would get postcards.

02:30.488 --> 02:34.960
I went to this auction, not even planning to buy it, but there was no interest in it.

02:34.980 --> 02:40.836
I paid $250, less than half a penny a piece for these extraordinary postcards.

02:41.018 --> 02:44.262
And then the woman, oh, I don't want to get into this, but they wanted to buy it for me.

02:44.282 --> 02:45.504
I said, no, you're going to break it up.

02:45.524 --> 02:47.366
I'm going to keep it as a collection.

02:47.386 --> 02:50.910
And the thing is, if we're big enough, we can keep this.

02:50.931 --> 02:52.613
I mean, it really does.

02:52.633 --> 02:56.618
You know, what went into the stacks is the children's literature.

02:56.638 --> 02:59.261
Well, now we've got this book that he collected.

02:59.281 --> 03:03.126
Do you keep it as a collection, or is it dispersed throughout the rest of the collection?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.387
Well, cryptography is a collection.

03:04.468 --> 03:06.310
Cryptography is a collection.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.072
Do you have a name for it?

03:08.232 --> 03:09.574
We have a special class mark.

03:09.858 --> 03:10.880
What was his name on it?

03:10.900 --> 03:11.541
Dar-K-F-G-F.

03:11.561 --> 03:12.944
Yes, Shulman Gift.

03:13.705 --> 03:15.549
Dar-K-G-F for Shulman.

03:15.569 --> 03:17.613
And then Shulman Cryptography Collection.

03:17.633 --> 03:21.000
He had to create a special class mark for the collection.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.723
He's smiling, so he likes that.

03:22.743 --> 03:28.053
Yeah, of course, I suggested to Frank Madsen, we don't have a special class mark.

03:28.073 --> 03:32.001
A lot of the cryptography books were classified under shorthand.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.584
and other related subjects, espionage.

03:35.684 --> 03:37.186
What was the classification you get?

03:37.246 --> 03:38.568
I think it's Star KGS.

03:38.628 --> 03:47.619
Star K for rare books, and then G for named collections, and then I think it's S for Shulman, but I'm not positive.

03:47.779 --> 03:50.803
I'd like to know if that would help at some point.

03:50.883 --> 03:53.286
We'll talk at some point by phone or whatever.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.527
Definitely all together.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.111
And then the other thing, we're exploring.

03:57.131 --> 03:59.153
You see, we have this classification in it.

04:00.027 --> 04:10.516
the way that Reserve Division was set up initially, American imprints, British imprints, European imprints, and then a couple of different formats, like broadsides and the like.

04:10.937 --> 04:21.526
But everything that is printed after our sort of cutoff date goes into this overall collection called Star KF, which is everything but literature and our imprints.

04:22.066 --> 04:22.767
It's not good enough.

04:22.787 --> 04:27.891
We're going to have to begin to build, and we've talked a lot about this, building special collections.

04:27.911 --> 04:29.713
So to keep material together, just

04:30.048 --> 04:34.112
because you can't just keep fitting it into this sort of overall arching.

04:34.132 --> 04:35.414
What's your direct phone number?

04:35.434 --> 04:36.034
212-930-0805.

04:36.074 --> 04:38.657
0805.

04:39.458 --> 04:42.181
Very good.

04:43.402 --> 04:52.752
By the way, it's such a good collection that the previous president of the New York Public Library, Gregorian Bartin.

04:52.772 --> 04:55.355
Bartin is a strange name.

04:55.755 --> 04:57.117
I've interviewed him for my new book.

04:58.839 --> 04:59.059
Go ahead.

04:59.748 --> 05:02.651
He personally wanted to look at the collection.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.413
I gave him a tour of the collection.

05:05.033 --> 05:05.994
And he said, wonderful.

05:06.034 --> 05:07.035
He was so impressed.

05:08.096 --> 05:22.050
And being that he was a professor of history, he asked me, did Cardinal Richelieu ever have anything to do under King Louis XIV with cryptography of secret code and stuff like that?

05:23.111 --> 05:28.776
I told him about my annotated bibliography that I would look through it and find out.

05:29.043 --> 05:30.706
And he answered his query.

05:31.467 --> 05:37.577
Then the new president now, the clerk, he's getting an education.

05:37.597 --> 05:40.341
We're going to happen to mention that we have a horn book.

05:40.361 --> 05:41.723
Paul's going to love that.

05:41.743 --> 05:42.344
The horn book.

05:42.485 --> 05:44.708
He said, you've never heard of a horn book.

05:44.808 --> 05:45.149
I know.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.373
And I had to describe it to him.

05:47.393 --> 05:48.675
He said, I would love to see it.

05:49.496 --> 05:51.359
He's going to come down and look at the horn book.

05:51.479 --> 05:52.040
That's great.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.262
So let's...

05:54.052 --> 05:55.293
We've got a lot of area to cover.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.355
We've got to talk about your OED stuff.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.576
We've got to talk about... Oh, yeah.

05:58.597 --> 06:00.238
I haven't even gotten to that subject.

06:00.518 --> 06:03.381
That reminds me of connection with OED.

06:03.982 --> 06:10.028
Morganita Lasky, she is the foremost contributor to the supplement.

06:10.408 --> 06:15.213
She has sent in about a hundred thousand slips, citations.

06:16.514 --> 06:18.416
She's a graduate of Oxford.

06:18.436 --> 06:21.119
Why don't you go sit in that chair so I can get you going this way.

06:22.220 --> 06:22.320
Yeah.

06:22.925 --> 06:23.606
Keep talking.

06:25.148 --> 06:28.533
Let me take a couple of shots.

06:28.733 --> 06:31.156
What are you talking about with the OED?

06:31.176 --> 06:31.297
Yeah.

06:31.317 --> 06:51.725
Marlonita Lasky, one of the foremost contributors to the supplement of the Oxford English Dictionary, had heard about me, one of their editors, and she was interested in meeting me.

06:51.745 --> 06:51.885
Mm-hmm.

06:53.570 --> 07:01.341
So I wrote back to the editor and provided my address and phone number.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.749
Go ahead.

07:06.769 --> 07:07.410
I'll pick who left.

07:09.253 --> 07:19.628
And when she came over from London on a visit to New York...

07:20.131 --> 07:33.365
She called me up and invited me to come over to her hotel in Madison Avenue to have tea and scones with her for a visit.

07:35.587 --> 07:36.067
And I did.

07:36.268 --> 07:40.732
I went over.

07:40.752 --> 07:48.400
And strangely enough, the gist of our conversation

07:48.565 --> 07:51.508
It had nothing to do with lexicography or the dictionary.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.592
She was interested in my Army career.

07:55.173 --> 07:56.514
She found herself fascinating.

07:57.135 --> 08:03.182
And all our time was spent with me telling her about my experiences in the Army, World War II.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.086
How did you start working on the OEB?

08:07.667 --> 08:10.691
How did you start doing the OEB?

08:10.711 --> 08:16.277
I always had an interest in dictionaries and words and so on.

08:17.472 --> 08:18.814
communicated with H.L.

08:18.874 --> 08:19.294
Mencken.

08:19.355 --> 08:21.017
He wrote me some very nice letters.

08:21.918 --> 08:29.128
I sent in suggestions for the origin of words, Americanism is a slang.

08:30.950 --> 08:33.374
And I wrote a couple of articles for American Speech.

08:36.037 --> 08:45.370
And then the editor of the OED sent out a general

08:47.543 --> 08:52.107
invitation to people who wanted to contribute to the supplement.

08:53.869 --> 08:57.112
And I became a volunteer contributor.

08:57.132 --> 09:06.542
They were so impressed with what I contributed that when the editor came over to New York for a visit, I showed him my file.

09:06.582 --> 09:13.989
I had a file of a couple of thousand citations, antedating what was in the Oxford English Dictionary.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.251
And he said,

09:17.294 --> 09:20.638
I take all of it and pay you for it.

09:20.658 --> 09:20.918
Wow.

09:21.238 --> 09:22.500
Yeah.

09:22.520 --> 09:27.005
And whatever you send in, we'll pay you for it.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.549
How did you decide what words to go to go searching for?

09:30.589 --> 09:31.350
Tell me some of the words.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.433
I saw the Big Apple and taking a Brody and stuff like that.

09:34.453 --> 09:34.974
Yeah.

09:34.994 --> 09:38.778
Is this stuff that you get, like going through the newspapers?

09:39.719 --> 09:42.202
How do you decide what to do?

09:42.222 --> 09:43.403
I have a very good memory.

09:43.602 --> 09:54.318
for the words that are entered in the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest dates or appearances in print.

09:54.338 --> 10:12.124
So when I read different books and so on, and I find a certain word, I think may have been overlooked by the Oxford English Dictionary, or seemed to be of an earlier date.

10:12.374 --> 10:13.736
Copy it down on a slip.

10:15.819 --> 10:17.260
Here it is.

10:17.280 --> 10:17.801
I got it now.

10:18.242 --> 10:26.052
Okay.

10:26.072 --> 10:26.332
I got it now.

10:26.352 --> 10:26.453
Okay.

10:26.473 --> 10:26.573
Okay.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.113
Keep talking.

10:27.214 --> 10:28.675
Yes.

10:28.716 --> 10:35.925
I copy down words from various books and magazines and newspapers I read, and I check them out.

10:37.808 --> 10:38.368
OED.

10:39.089 --> 10:41.993
If I find that they have already been recorded,

10:43.019 --> 10:58.239
But when I find out that they haven't been recorded, those are the ones I call to their attention.

10:58.259 --> 10:58.479
Okay.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.702
How do you find the work?

11:00.722 --> 11:04.127
In the OED, you're trying to find the proponents, the first use of the word.

11:04.367 --> 11:04.848
Yeah.

11:04.948 --> 11:09.153
So how do you go about doing that?

11:09.173 --> 11:11.997
Well, I check with OED.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.583
to see if they have any entry for it.

11:16.364 --> 11:22.090
In the original OED, there was no entry.

11:24.052 --> 11:30.338
And in the supplement, they had an entry of about, say, 1922.

11:30.358 --> 11:33.421
It's over here, so you can keep talking.

11:33.982 --> 11:37.445
I like the way you're sitting like that.

11:37.465 --> 11:38.286
Go ahead, keep talking.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.267
It's picking you up.

11:44.427 --> 11:52.816
That's great.

11:52.836 --> 12:13.017
So, in the course of my reading, I found in a book of poems by some writer in the early 1900s, where the writer used the expression, a big apple.

12:13.655 --> 12:20.565
compare New York with a big apple that spreads its roots everywhere, and so on.

12:21.387 --> 12:26.314
So I copied that, sent it in, the OED.

12:26.374 --> 12:32.183
Now in the case of a slang expression like, it's a doozy.

12:33.565 --> 12:34.226
That's one of yours?

12:35.047 --> 12:36.349
Yeah.

12:36.369 --> 12:42.138
It wasn't entered in OED, in the original, or in the supplement.

12:42.158 --> 12:42.919
So...

12:43.422 --> 12:49.088
I sent that in, and I asked them, why did they overlook it?

12:49.108 --> 12:51.791
Why wasn't it entered?

12:51.811 --> 12:57.376
They said, well, we were waiting for your citation.

12:57.396 --> 12:59.198
Can you name a few others that come to mind?

13:00.319 --> 13:01.641
Doozy, can you think of a few others?

13:01.661 --> 13:03.302
Yeah.

13:03.323 --> 13:04.163
And I'll look them all up.

13:04.183 --> 13:04.944
I'll check them out.

13:04.984 --> 13:05.224
Okay.

13:05.365 --> 13:07.707
Because I have an OED at home.

13:07.727 --> 13:07.927
Good.

13:08.007 --> 13:09.629
Do you have a second edition?

13:09.649 --> 13:11.030
I do, with all the supplements.

13:11.050 --> 13:12.552
Yeah, that includes supplements.

13:13.797 --> 13:15.999
Doozy, Brody, Big Apple.

13:18.061 --> 13:19.603
What are some of the others?

13:19.623 --> 13:20.684
Bagels and lox.

13:21.264 --> 13:21.885
They weren't in?

13:23.687 --> 13:25.769
I sent them the citation.

13:25.789 --> 13:27.671
Bagels and lox were not in the OED?

13:28.912 --> 13:30.293
What's the provenance of those words?

13:30.373 --> 13:31.294
How old are they?

13:31.314 --> 13:32.956
I'm Yiddish.

13:32.976 --> 13:35.378
Bagels and lox is a favorite part of that.

13:35.398 --> 13:40.063
I know what it is, but I'm shocked that it wouldn't be in the OED.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.505
What was the earliest reference you could find for it?

13:43.143 --> 13:44.644
On hand.

13:44.664 --> 13:45.665
For Bagel itself.

13:46.646 --> 13:54.453
It was traced all the way back to Poland in the 17th century.

13:54.874 --> 13:56.215
And you found references for it?

13:56.355 --> 13:56.635
Yeah.

13:57.576 --> 13:58.377
But I wasn't the one.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.258
There were others who made a study.

14:09.747 --> 14:13.150
Professor David Gold, who was a great linguist,

14:14.260 --> 14:19.528
and a professor of syllabic languages and so on at the University of Tel Aviv.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.152
He's a consultant for dictionaries.

14:22.172 --> 14:26.618
He made a study of Bevel, and he traced it all the way back to Poland.

14:28.501 --> 14:33.889
So it's well-known, but the dictionary itself, you know, actually hadn't recorded it.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.893
There were many common words.

14:37.775 --> 14:42.141
Was that kind of a hobby of yours, or did you take this very seriously?

14:42.323 --> 14:44.906
Tell me about after the war, the kind of work that you did.

14:44.946 --> 14:46.929
How did you make a living?

14:46.949 --> 14:49.272
I worked for newspapers.

14:49.292 --> 14:50.633
I continued to work for promotion.

14:50.654 --> 14:53.838
I went to work for the Hearst Corporation.

14:53.858 --> 14:54.779
As a present person?

14:55.079 --> 14:56.841
As a kind of promotion guy.

14:57.382 --> 14:58.684
The promotion department.

15:00.226 --> 15:03.930
All their syndicated newspapers throughout the country.

15:03.950 --> 15:06.413
And so what were the years that you left them?

15:06.534 --> 15:08.096
Under Bob Levitt.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.879
He was their publisher.

15:12.074 --> 15:21.185
and had a promotion for the Hearst Publications.

15:21.205 --> 15:25.110
I love these pictures.

15:25.130 --> 15:31.538
I just love this room.

15:31.558 --> 15:31.658
Yeah.

15:31.678 --> 15:35.202
I usually come down with a beautiful contacts camera.

15:35.322 --> 15:36.284
My wife called me.

15:36.304 --> 15:37.525
She said, what's your camera?

15:37.808 --> 15:39.030
So I brought one of these.

15:39.050 --> 15:41.553
These are supposed to be excellent at one-time use.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.337
They only use it once, but it's got a good lens and excellent film.

15:45.398 --> 15:48.983
Because I like to have a photographic record of everybody you're talking about.

15:49.043 --> 15:49.504
That's good.

15:50.165 --> 15:55.272
I have a tape, I have a photographic record.

15:55.292 --> 15:56.434
So you were working for Hearst.

15:56.774 --> 15:58.817
How many years were you working with them?

15:58.837 --> 15:59.638
When did you retire?

16:01.100 --> 16:02.662
Well, I was semi-retired.

16:02.782 --> 16:03.343
What happened?

16:03.764 --> 16:04.845
I can bring this in a little bit.

16:05.787 --> 16:11.275
After I finish work, we're getting stuff for you.

16:11.495 --> 16:14.639
All right, you want to come in here?

16:14.659 --> 16:16.922
No, no, if it's ready, because we're going to talk.

16:17.003 --> 16:21.789
We're going to keep on talking.

16:21.809 --> 16:23.792
Okay, Jenny, just send your name once more.

16:23.812 --> 16:26.496
Oh, it's Jennifer Lee.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.018
Okay.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.161
Good luck.

16:30.862 --> 16:31.002
Thanks.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.308
Thanks so much for everything.

16:34.328 --> 16:38.713
Tell me a little bit while we're waiting for David about his collection.

16:39.314 --> 16:44.741
Well, he's so delightful, you know, and he loves coming in.

16:44.841 --> 16:49.607
And he's been working on various projects.

16:49.807 --> 16:57.316
They haven't been so much in the espionage of late, but... That's funny.

16:57.837 --> 16:58.838
Talking about dinner.

16:58.898 --> 17:00.280
Oh, yeah.

17:00.496 --> 17:15.932
They're mostly 20th century books, and they run where they start to be modern books around the corner, so it's about maybe 10, 12 units of shelving.

17:16.613 --> 17:21.358
And there are a few dozen of older items.

17:21.979 --> 17:22.700
We found it.

17:23.200 --> 17:23.861
We found it.

17:23.881 --> 17:24.842
I hadn't seen this yet.

17:25.162 --> 17:26.824
So tell me what we're looking at here, David.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.618
Oh, wow.

17:31.980 --> 17:33.383
This is not printed.

17:34.464 --> 17:36.167
It's all manuscripts.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.048
Wow.

17:37.068 --> 17:39.732
And the original is in Yale University.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.333
Can I get this?

17:40.373 --> 17:42.637
This is a bibliographic reference to that.

17:42.657 --> 17:43.258
Yes.

17:43.318 --> 17:44.259
Okay, sure.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.062
Instead of trying to trust my hand.

17:46.082 --> 17:58.701
In the Red Book Division at Yale University, I went up there many years ago, about 30 years ago, and they showed me the original printed copy, and we compared it.

17:58.968 --> 17:59.729
Identical.

18:00.570 --> 18:00.891
Wow.

18:01.131 --> 18:01.993
The manuscript?

18:02.073 --> 18:03.595
This is a manuscript?

18:03.615 --> 18:04.476
It's a manuscript.

18:05.077 --> 18:08.122
What's the date on this?

18:08.142 --> 18:12.849
1660.

18:12.949 --> 18:14.652
Could you do that?

18:14.872 --> 18:15.413
1660.

18:15.433 --> 18:15.754
What?

18:15.814 --> 18:17.977
I'm going to get a Xerox in this description.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.259
They won't describe.

18:20.261 --> 18:21.543
Oh, yeah, thank you.

18:21.783 --> 18:24.227
I wrote that description, sorry.

18:24.247 --> 18:24.587
Oh, okay.

18:24.627 --> 18:26.410
I know the rule.

18:28.043 --> 18:29.225
1660?

18:29.345 --> 18:37.898
Why don't you tell me about the book?

18:37.918 --> 18:40.502
What's important about this book?

18:40.522 --> 18:42.065
What's important?

18:42.085 --> 18:44.208
It's a unique copy as far as I know.

18:44.789 --> 18:48.334
This is the manuscript probably for the printer.

18:50.157 --> 18:51.119
Then printed the book.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.806
And the content of the book is all on cryptography.

18:56.056 --> 19:01.182
Different kinds of alphabets, secret writing from the 16th and 17th century game.

19:01.202 --> 19:04.166
All kinds of alphabets from various languages.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.049
It's a treatise on the language of strangers.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.070
Strange languages.

19:08.331 --> 19:11.234
A treatise of strange languages.

19:11.254 --> 19:11.635
And their alphabet.

19:11.655 --> 19:14.919
And does it have the French title here, too?

19:14.939 --> 19:15.239
Oh, yeah.

19:15.259 --> 19:16.360
Look at the colophon.

19:16.921 --> 19:17.822
Isn't that beautiful?

19:17.842 --> 19:18.983
Wow, that's extraordinary.

19:20.085 --> 19:21.186
And where did you find this book?

19:22.685 --> 19:23.926
Do you remember where you found this book?

19:23.946 --> 19:24.667
I don't remember.

19:24.747 --> 19:30.835
There were so many different books of interest, and you have to go by the annotation, whatever I wrote.

19:32.316 --> 19:34.920
Well, is this who you bought it from?

19:34.940 --> 19:35.720
Oh, yeah.

19:35.741 --> 19:40.246
See, I saved the citations from the catalogs.

19:40.306 --> 19:43.710
I picked this up through a catalog.

19:43.770 --> 19:49.637
In 1967, the dealer was Francois Chaminade.

19:49.904 --> 19:52.567
So you got it out of a catalog in Paris, right?

19:52.587 --> 19:53.388
Yeah.

19:53.408 --> 19:55.690
And it said, original edition.

19:57.452 --> 20:01.095
Contains chapters of secret writing.

20:02.997 --> 20:04.799
Good example.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.302
Terrific example.

20:08.142 --> 20:14.629
What's the most you ever painted?

20:15.925 --> 20:19.210
Oh, I paid $200 for the Tristavius.

20:21.393 --> 20:24.658
He got his books at a recent time.

20:24.718 --> 20:26.520
That went for $3,000 in the South.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.542
He was the second copy.

20:28.643 --> 20:30.346
A year later, they had another copy.

20:30.366 --> 20:32.088
It went for the book.

20:32.108 --> 20:33.490
And what was the name of the book again?

20:33.971 --> 20:34.812
Tristavius.

20:34.932 --> 20:38.017
Polygraphia.

20:38.037 --> 20:38.958
Polygraphiae.

20:39.579 --> 20:41.922
Polygraphiae.

20:41.942 --> 20:42.824
Polygraphiae.

20:43.725 --> 20:44.025
Sex.

20:45.087 --> 20:45.848
Libri.

20:46.334 --> 20:49.044
And six books.

20:49.064 --> 20:49.485
401.

20:51.352 --> 20:52.376
Printed book.

20:52.396 --> 20:53.560
1518.

20:53.827 --> 21:01.658
The price printed book.

21:03.201 --> 21:21.808
It's all in chronological order.

21:21.788 --> 21:29.840
Here.

21:32.944 --> 21:43.039
Yale University Library has a copy, a printed copy, British Museum Library, and Bibliothek National.

21:43.059 --> 21:51.070
But this is the manuscript, probably the original, in a beautiful, upright Roman hand, in Schumann's collection.

21:52.231 --> 22:07.889
Based chiefly on Virginia's book, the author was the son of Guillaume Cortet, poet and author of a book of riddles in which the name of Francois also appears.

22:09.070 --> 22:20.263
You found these books mostly by plugging around going to, and I have read a lot of catalogs on the mailing list of various book dealers in England, France, Italy.

22:20.986 --> 22:23.910
Did you think you were obsessed by this?

22:23.930 --> 22:26.394
Is this an obsession that you were driven by?

22:29.519 --> 22:29.739
No.

22:30.280 --> 22:37.130
Of course, an obsession would preclude any other subject that I may have in my mind.

22:37.831 --> 22:48.006
In other words, this doesn't interfere with my interest in lexicography, words, linguistics, languages.

22:48.475 --> 22:49.076
Et cetera.

22:49.616 --> 22:53.681
And doesn't interfere with other interests I have, like in sports.

22:53.701 --> 22:56.064
I was a very good tennis player.

22:56.084 --> 23:00.629
I played in a national championship in mixed doubles.

23:00.710 --> 23:01.110
Okay.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.172
Yeah, up in Longwood, Massachusetts.

23:03.653 --> 23:03.793
Uh-huh.

23:03.813 --> 23:04.634
I know that.

23:04.694 --> 23:05.535
Yeah, I'd be indoors.

23:06.436 --> 23:13.164
At Longwood, they were held in the national... That's outside of Brooklyn.

23:13.184 --> 23:13.284
Yeah.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.966
Called the national championship.

23:14.986 --> 23:15.687
And when was that?

23:15.707 --> 23:17.149
For mixed doubles.

23:17.365 --> 23:21.291
Oh, it comes back about 20 years ago.

23:21.632 --> 23:24.436
Yeah, in the 1950s.

23:25.477 --> 23:27.340
Well, I did.

23:27.641 --> 23:32.468
I teamed up with this woman who was national handball champion.

23:32.488 --> 23:34.912
She was a very good athlete.

23:35.353 --> 23:36.354
And she took up tennis.

23:37.356 --> 23:39.779
She was pretty good at that.

23:39.799 --> 23:42.524
So she asked me to be her partner for mixed doubles.

23:42.544 --> 23:43.245
And you said you won?

23:43.585 --> 23:43.926
You won?

23:43.986 --> 23:45.448
She didn't win the title, no.

23:45.682 --> 23:46.403
But you competed.

23:46.423 --> 23:47.684
We competed.

23:47.704 --> 23:49.466
And you were seated.

23:50.367 --> 23:51.228
We're in the draw.

23:51.548 --> 23:52.249
That's great.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.413
God, there's so many things to talk to you about.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.795
I'm going to slip away just briefly, and I'll be back.

23:59.035 --> 24:01.137
And Miriam has the other books for you.

24:01.738 --> 24:02.519
Okay, good job.

24:02.539 --> 24:04.160
And whatever else you need.

24:04.180 --> 24:04.321
Thanks.

24:06.483 --> 24:06.583
Okay.

24:06.603 --> 24:11.588
You have some other books?

24:11.688 --> 24:12.128
Yeah.

24:12.148 --> 24:12.769
Oh, yeah.

24:13.593 --> 24:31.337
He was going to copy some of these things for me, too.

24:33.159 --> 24:38.826
I guess of all the different books he talks about because I might want to make reference to them.

24:38.867 --> 24:41.490
Well, that's quite a book.

24:42.770 --> 24:43.871
So tell me about this one.

24:43.991 --> 24:44.872
Oh, look at the paper.

24:44.892 --> 24:46.313
That's gorgeous, that handmade.

24:46.934 --> 24:48.155
Oh, that's the polygraphia.

24:50.737 --> 24:57.162
That's quite wonderful.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.649
So tell me a little bit about it, what we're looking at.

25:04.689 --> 25:06.830
Tell me what we're looking at here.

25:06.851 --> 25:12.135
We're looking at a book by Athanasius Karcher.

25:14.073 --> 25:17.218
who belong to the Jesuit Society.

25:21.265 --> 25:25.812
The title of it is Polygraphia.

25:25.832 --> 25:30.920
Polygraphia, Nova, New and Universal.

25:34.025 --> 25:35.828
Did you use these books in your research?

25:36.601 --> 25:42.210
Did you, did you, when you got the, were you collecting or were you actually trying to?

25:42.230 --> 25:44.013
I actually read them and studying them.

25:44.033 --> 25:50.944
Go back to the second page, you know.

25:51.024 --> 25:51.304
Thanks.

25:53.027 --> 25:53.287
I had that.

25:53.307 --> 25:55.451
It was too good.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.873
I got a picture of you, too.

25:56.893 --> 25:57.694
Just right like that.

25:59.577 --> 25:59.898
Yeah, it's good.

25:59.918 --> 26:00.178
Whoa.

26:08.512 --> 26:15.699
Excellent.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.764
So tell me how this book helped you in your work.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.387
Did you know about this book?

26:23.407 --> 26:26.130
Yes, I knew about this book.

26:26.230 --> 26:35.280
It took me a long time to find a captain for sale.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.383
It looked like a very elegant book.

26:38.583 --> 26:47.173
What kind of person was this book produced for?

26:47.253 --> 26:49.555
It appears to be a very elegant and produced book.

26:50.136 --> 26:55.502
Most mean by Lillity, a handmade paper for scholars.

26:59.507 --> 27:03.491
And you say this book is probably the most expensive book you bought?

27:03.511 --> 27:04.753
No.

27:04.773 --> 27:05.974
I was lucky on this one.

27:06.393 --> 27:08.796
I got this, I think, for about $50.

27:09.257 --> 27:10.419
Did they pay $50 for this?

27:10.839 --> 27:10.999
Yeah.

27:11.941 --> 27:12.321
Wow.

27:12.341 --> 27:13.743
Yeah, that's about 30 years ago.

27:13.823 --> 27:14.184
It doesn't matter.

27:14.244 --> 27:14.925
That's great.

27:14.945 --> 27:16.848
It's a good price.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.351
It's gorgeous.

27:19.431 --> 27:21.034
That chart is just wonderful.

27:21.054 --> 27:22.536
How many different languages do you read?

27:24.178 --> 27:26.982
I still read about a half a dozen different languages.

27:28.364 --> 27:30.006
Is it necessary in that kind of work?

27:30.026 --> 27:34.813
It's just about the photography, yes.

27:35.637 --> 27:40.785
And then, of course, you were a Scrabble champion as well.

27:41.366 --> 27:42.889
Yeah, but I knew so much about words.

27:44.972 --> 27:48.798
What is the fascination of words for you?

27:48.838 --> 27:53.205
The fascination of the language?

27:53.225 --> 28:00.717
Well, to be literate, you have to know all about words.

28:01.135 --> 28:28.442
intellectual and so on you've got to have a good vocabulary the language you use is very important to your ability to communicate with other people as well as with yourself so man is very blessed to have the gift of language so what are the languages that you have you have french you have latin spanish german

28:28.793 --> 28:30.074
Italian, I would imagine.

28:30.115 --> 28:35.020
Yeah, Italian, the romance line.

28:35.401 --> 28:38.645
It is.

28:40.066 --> 28:43.570
I'd like to comment on the library, what this library has meant to you.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.013
This clearly is your home.

28:46.233 --> 28:49.417
Yeah, this is a home away from home.

28:50.659 --> 28:55.324
You spent time in here easily over the last 50, 60 years, is that right?

28:55.878 --> 29:00.646
At what point did you realize that this place was a home home?

29:00.966 --> 29:02.008
Right from the start.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.212
Right from the start.

29:04.332 --> 29:08.358
I wasn't present when they opened the library in 1911.

29:08.418 --> 29:10.321
I was born a year later.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.044
That was too late.

29:14.308 --> 29:14.949
That was too late.

29:16.892 --> 29:18.134
I missed the opening.

29:18.875 --> 29:22.341
President Tapp came and dedicated the library.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.537
So where have you done most of your work?

29:24.597 --> 29:26.278
In that room all over?

29:26.298 --> 29:27.319
Outside.

29:27.980 --> 29:28.661
Most of my work.

29:29.161 --> 29:37.489
There are many, many books, millions of books in the stacks that they can't have here in the rare books.

29:37.509 --> 29:50.522
And the course of my work, I have to consult a lot of contemporary books and early printed books and miscellaneous books.

29:51.211 --> 29:56.939
And you were mentioning also your mentor was the fellow from Whitley's Believe It or Not.

29:58.140 --> 30:01.064
Norbert, Norbert Pearl Rock.

30:02.026 --> 30:15.644
He had a command of several languages, and that's why Ripley hired him to do research and turn up all kinds of amazing stories and facts.

30:17.907 --> 30:20.290
And he spent every day here at the library.

30:20.675 --> 30:24.039
He looked like the number one leader of his time.

30:25.481 --> 30:26.623
And so you got to know him here?

30:27.063 --> 30:29.186
Yeah.

30:29.306 --> 30:31.850
And the Times described him as a mentor of yours.

30:31.950 --> 30:33.892
Is that a fair assessment?

30:35.114 --> 30:37.156
Well, in a very loose sense.

30:37.197 --> 30:39.840
He didn't really teach me anything that I didn't already know.

30:40.701 --> 30:49.112
Just I was curious as to how he went about digging up the material for Ripley, believe it or not.

30:49.835 --> 30:58.024
And he showed me those books that he carried with him, and jotted down things from different books that he consulted.

30:58.044 --> 31:00.126
And his work was at random.

31:00.146 --> 31:03.109
I said, well, what books do you decide to consult?

31:03.810 --> 31:05.512
He said, I take the cart catalog.

31:05.752 --> 31:11.098
At that time, he didn't have the printed catalog, cart catalog.

31:11.118 --> 31:18.846
I go through that, and when I see an item listed that I think may be of some interest, I call for it.

31:19.163 --> 31:25.312
So he would always call for about a dozen or so books at a time at the window.

31:25.913 --> 31:29.398
He'd carry them to the table and go through them.

31:29.418 --> 31:33.404
So at random, you know, it was like a random thing.

31:33.524 --> 31:38.892
He'd find all kinds of interesting things.

31:39.352 --> 31:44.820
How do you feel when you hear that libraries of the future are all going to be electronic?

31:44.840 --> 31:45.701
Do you believe that?

31:45.721 --> 31:48.225
What do you think about that?

31:48.425 --> 31:55.695
I think that has its merits and it has its setbacks.

31:57.157 --> 32:02.805
There are a lot of things that electronically cannot be recorded.

32:03.366 --> 32:04.628
There's no end to printing.

32:04.708 --> 32:07.372
Printing goes on and on.

32:08.253 --> 32:17.706
And the computers, whatever, can't keep up with anything that's being printed.

32:18.817 --> 32:21.622
especially newspapers every day and get a new edition.

32:23.165 --> 32:34.464
And you take my own collection that hasn't even been entered in the card catalog or the computers from the New York Public Library as yet.

32:35.646 --> 32:39.453
They've only, you know, entered about half a dozen items.

32:41.857 --> 32:44.301
What are they considered most important, like the Trefavius

32:44.686 --> 33:13.663
maybe the future i mean in terms of um getting access to resources so like for instance the whole oed is online now it's on yeah cd run i would say they reduced the price now but now it's cheaper i would say for things like that it's almost it almost makes sense to go electronic because it's because you're updating it so frequently they're under words entering the language every day literally and this way they can almost enter them at will

33:14.302 --> 33:16.545
Yeah, because they're going to have a new printout now.

33:18.849 --> 33:20.551
For the great edition, they're working on it.

33:20.571 --> 33:22.875
I didn't think they were going to print anymore.

33:22.935 --> 33:23.616
No, no, no.

33:24.397 --> 33:27.201
They have a computer database.

33:27.381 --> 33:28.082
Is that right?

33:28.243 --> 33:34.972
Everything that's being sent in can be recorded in their computer, and they can print it out.

33:35.834 --> 33:36.715
You have a proofreader.

33:36.965 --> 33:42.750
You had a comment from you the other day about the Simon Winchester book, The Professor and the Madman.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.511
Yeah.

33:43.571 --> 33:55.903
If he tried to be a contributor today and find earlier citations, as I have been, he would be madder than a madman.

33:57.484 --> 34:05.031
Because present-day OED is a collective effort of everything that's been in the past.

34:05.483 --> 34:06.925
of all their contributors.

34:07.926 --> 34:10.509
So he's only one person, and he has one contributor.

34:10.529 --> 34:12.531
I feel the same way about it, too.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.413
I don't know why other people contribute.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.956
I just go ahead and contribute when I see it.

34:17.957 --> 34:18.378
What happens?

34:18.398 --> 34:22.943
Do they contact you about a particular word, or do you find one and submit it to them?

34:23.143 --> 34:27.228
Well, I discourage them from contacting me on any particular word, but they have done it.

34:28.109 --> 34:34.056
Like the editor one time wrote to me, asked me, what's the difference between a forkball and a

34:34.559 --> 34:35.760
A split-finger ball.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.381
A split-finger fastball.

34:37.421 --> 34:40.544
Well, being that he's over in Oxford, they go in for cricket.

34:40.564 --> 34:42.686
They don't know anything about baseball.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.568
It has to be the same thing as a forkball.

34:45.448 --> 34:46.850
Pitcher throws in baseball.

34:46.870 --> 34:49.072
It's the same as a split-finger ball.

34:49.092 --> 34:51.033
A split-finger fastball, I think they call it.

34:51.053 --> 34:52.154
No, but is there a split-finger?

34:52.214 --> 34:53.796
A split-finger, just a split-finger ball.

34:54.837 --> 34:57.219
But you had to research that to find that out.

34:57.479 --> 34:58.440
How did you know that?

34:59.641 --> 34:59.881
I knew that.

34:59.901 --> 35:01.663
We know everything about baseball here.

35:02.283 --> 35:03.584
That's our national past.

35:03.624 --> 35:04.465
Of course, yeah.

35:05.052 --> 35:07.014
I know hardly anything about cricket.

35:07.075 --> 35:10.379
If he taught me about cricket, it should hold them well.

35:11.140 --> 35:14.444
I'd love for you to name a few more words that you worked on.

35:14.464 --> 35:15.445
You gave me a few.

35:15.465 --> 35:17.548
I'd love about ten.

35:18.369 --> 35:20.011
The bagels and locks, which I really like.

35:20.932 --> 35:23.235
So were they done separately, or as one?

35:23.255 --> 35:24.957
Were bagel and locks separately?

35:24.977 --> 35:25.858
Separately, yeah.

35:25.878 --> 35:30.604
So that would be, that's a separate, those are some separate words.

35:32.187 --> 35:35.550
The Great White Way, which is a nickname for Broadway.

35:35.650 --> 35:36.812
That's yours?

35:36.832 --> 35:37.472
Yeah.

35:37.492 --> 35:38.113
I found that.

35:38.133 --> 35:45.420
It was named after the advertising neon signs.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.141
Times Square.

35:47.883 --> 35:49.204
Times Square is another one?

35:49.664 --> 35:50.745
No, Times Square.

35:50.806 --> 35:54.009
That's the Great White Way, Broadway, Times Square.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.753
Fiasco section.

35:58.773 --> 36:00.355
It was named after Snowstorm.

36:02.157 --> 36:09.528
Can you take a one or two words?

36:09.548 --> 36:16.918
By a theatrical writer or critic for a New York newspaper at the time.

36:17.779 --> 36:18.300
He called.

36:18.841 --> 36:19.822
He looked out the window.

36:20.704 --> 36:29.176
He saw all that snow had accumulated on Broadway, and there was a strike of the sanitation department.

36:30.638 --> 36:32.080
So he called the Great White Way.

36:32.498 --> 36:33.580
I've got a question for you.

36:34.021 --> 36:35.984
I don't know the answer, and I'm dying to find out.

36:37.226 --> 36:40.392
How does the tradition of lions in front of libraries start?

36:42.776 --> 36:48.807
What makes the lion... That's her department, or his department.

36:48.827 --> 36:49.849
Do you have an answer for that?

36:51.351 --> 36:52.954
How does the tradition of the lion...

36:53.592 --> 36:58.638
That's just Fifth Avenue of all libraries.

36:58.698 --> 37:01.201
I mean, Boston Public Library has two lions inside.

37:01.301 --> 37:01.982
They've got lions.

37:02.943 --> 37:05.987
Probably just St.

37:06.187 --> 37:06.728
Charles, right?

37:06.808 --> 37:07.008
Yeah.

37:08.490 --> 37:10.953
I mean, you think it's the St.

37:10.993 --> 37:11.734
Jerome thing?

37:11.854 --> 37:13.456
I think it could be Jerome with the lion.

37:13.596 --> 37:17.220
Well, no.

37:17.842 --> 37:24.449
How fancy you're entitled to be depending on your rank in society.

37:24.469 --> 37:32.276
A nobleman could put lions at the end of the drive leading into his property or house.

37:32.797 --> 37:33.818
No one less than that.

37:34.739 --> 37:36.821
You're going back now to medieval times?

37:37.362 --> 37:43.127
I think it was more of a renaissance fashion.

37:43.368 --> 37:47.832
If you want to say medieval, you're talking about heraldry.

37:48.655 --> 38:18.595
right that's when you see them appearing i don't know why i can do it associated with spanish but you see two lions out in front maybe even supporting a shield you could have a family coat of arms on but the lions themselves are with part of that signal of social status right and then of course as that

38:19.148 --> 38:29.109
custom retreats into the past, and people forget what they're for, they do remember that lions are supposed to be a good man, like their status associated with lions.

38:29.129 --> 38:31.795
So then you see them appear in front of them.

38:31.815 --> 38:33.999
What would this be a thousand years ago?

38:34.019 --> 38:36.124
It would have to be a nobleman's palace, right?

38:36.144 --> 38:39.992
I doubt that it was a public library once they were going to go back to Rome, maybe.

38:40.462 --> 38:45.133
I've been trying to find some, I've been researching this for chapter in his book.

38:45.574 --> 38:48.180
Oh, no, I'm not giving a very good explanation.

38:48.400 --> 38:48.941
I am right.

38:48.981 --> 38:52.329
You can get a genealogy people down the other end.

38:52.349 --> 38:53.552
Or at the information test.

38:53.953 --> 38:55.356
I have some people there.

38:55.576 --> 38:56.739
No, they're not going to know.

38:56.879 --> 38:59.365
I mean, believe me, I've tried already.

38:59.581 --> 39:01.124
I know it's patience and fortitude.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.770
I've even been toying with the idea— Oh, you mean these particularly?

39:03.790 --> 39:04.973
No, no, lions in general.

39:05.093 --> 39:11.226
But I mean, but— Well, they were part of the stories of noblemen.

39:11.246 --> 39:12.108
But why libraries?

39:12.128 --> 39:13.712
But why libraries in particular?

39:15.075 --> 39:17.600
And I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the St.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.923
Jerome tradition.

39:19.358 --> 39:39.596
Why, at the end of the driveway of some nouveau riche slab up in Westchester, he's got, and I can show you, houses where they, people, somebody builds up in Greenwich, there's a phony trianon built by a rich man who just, he doesn't understand it, but he knows that it's a fancy building, I don't know, as well.

39:39.616 --> 39:49.365
Somebody else might do an imitation, a setting plantation, and there's, I see cast cement linens in front of some driveways.

39:49.733 --> 39:58.226
And there's one interesting guy I've never met who has a pair of sphinxes at the end of this driveway.

39:58.246 --> 40:10.544
Only they are copies of sphinxes from Versailles, the heads of 18th century century.

40:10.764 --> 40:12.687
I think that this library...

40:12.970 --> 40:15.073
is copying the British Library.

40:15.093 --> 40:15.734
That's right.

40:15.754 --> 40:16.235
Right.

40:16.255 --> 40:18.318
And then you may say, why does the British Library do it?

40:18.338 --> 40:20.060
Well, see, they have a double valid reason.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.664
One is the association with nobility and strength.

40:22.684 --> 40:24.887
But the lion is... It's the British Lion.

40:24.907 --> 40:26.269
So you could say what they're doing.

40:26.289 --> 40:32.739
Well, it's very... The lion is one of our supporters.

40:34.421 --> 40:37.245
I think it's the British or the lion as a symbol of Britain.

40:37.265 --> 40:39.028
You know, I read someplace that

40:39.194 --> 40:43.238
I never knew that libraries had a patron saint, but St.

40:43.278 --> 40:45.760
Jerome is the patron saint of libraries.

40:45.780 --> 40:47.082
I disagree with that.

40:47.182 --> 40:48.723
I mean, it could be wrong.

40:48.883 --> 40:49.003
St.

40:49.063 --> 40:57.672
Jerome is certainly the patron of a lot of kinds of bookwear, but I wouldn't put him in for libraries.

40:57.692 --> 40:57.872
St.

40:57.892 --> 41:05.419
Jerome, of course, translated and re-edited the Bible.

41:07.441 --> 41:08.442
He was no friend.

41:08.776 --> 41:10.799
of arts people.

41:11.179 --> 41:16.827
He was very critical of illuminated manuscripts and gorgeous blinds.

41:16.867 --> 41:23.336
As a matter of fact, there are a number of quotes from him against doing that.

41:23.356 --> 41:28.123
Translating, transcribing, copying and disseminating the text, that was good.

41:28.143 --> 41:35.273
But he said that parchments are dyed purple and bindings are covered with

41:35.793 --> 41:39.778
while Christ lies at the door and may give a plea.

41:39.798 --> 41:42.701
So that was what he preached against it.

41:42.721 --> 41:43.943
Not to say I don't admire St.

41:43.963 --> 41:45.645
Jerome.

41:45.665 --> 41:56.878
Now, my candidate for patron of libraries is Roswitha, a German abbot of St.

41:57.098 --> 41:57.378
Roswitha.

41:57.398 --> 42:00.602
So she actually established a monastic library.

42:00.987 --> 42:02.209
I'm here at the library.

42:03.370 --> 42:05.253
I'm not sure yet.

42:06.114 --> 42:08.757
I may be going back tomorrow.

42:08.837 --> 42:15.346
I'll be here tomorrow, but if you want us to look it up, that's why we have the lines here.

42:16.007 --> 42:20.693
I could go down to the architecture office.

42:20.793 --> 42:21.714
I'd come right for that.

42:21.734 --> 42:23.316
I'd stick around.

42:23.448 --> 42:25.750
Yeah, I'm sure they might have it.

42:25.770 --> 42:29.274
Because they have the blueprints and everything on the opening of the library.

42:29.294 --> 42:31.035
Why did this library choose to have it?

42:31.055 --> 42:32.677
Oh, by the way, they have that exhibit there.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.058
Have you seen it on second floor?

42:34.078 --> 42:36.060
I was taking notes on it, yeah.

42:36.301 --> 42:37.302
Don't bother to do that.

42:37.602 --> 42:40.445
I think I've got to go back a lot deeper in time.

42:41.386 --> 42:44.048
I mean, you're not asking why this particular library has it.

42:44.088 --> 42:45.189
You're saying, why have it now?

42:45.209 --> 42:47.992
Because I think the short answer is, yeah, we copied the British Library.

42:48.032 --> 42:49.053
I think so, yeah.

42:49.073 --> 42:53.117
I don't... And I think that the answer for the British Library is, Miriam, they've kind of...

42:53.418 --> 42:55.080
easy for them to do lions.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.222
There's lions everywhere in all kinds of countries.

42:57.262 --> 43:00.485
It's not just the British Library.

43:00.505 --> 43:07.552
Well, I don't know if I'm right or not, and I can't give you... But who was the saint that you met?

43:07.592 --> 43:09.393
Who was your candidate saint?

43:09.714 --> 43:14.919
H-R-O-S-W-I-T-H-A.

43:17.601 --> 43:22.446
She was a noblewoman who retired to a monastery, a nunnery.

43:22.865 --> 43:24.489
and became the abbess there.

43:25.290 --> 43:37.858
And she established a library and set all of her sisters to copy.

43:39.101 --> 43:41.987
Are you going to quote him?

43:42.338 --> 43:46.144
You'll see in my book.

43:46.164 --> 43:49.729
And I think she wrote this because this is the 10th century.

43:49.849 --> 43:56.319
There was actually a women's bibliophile group, I think, that was once part of the Gloria Club.

43:56.359 --> 43:59.463
Yeah, the Rasweeda Society for that reason.

43:59.724 --> 44:04.391
Exactly, exactly.

44:04.411 --> 44:08.076
Were there any other books that you wanted to show me?

44:08.748 --> 44:10.891
If it's getting late, I want to leave about 2 o'clock.

44:10.911 --> 44:11.773
Okay, good night.

44:11.793 --> 44:13.155
I've got an appointment downtown, too.

44:14.237 --> 44:14.778
Shesemius.

44:18.724 --> 44:19.625
Okay, great, thanks.

44:19.765 --> 44:23.111
Don't get me going any longer on the subject.

44:23.171 --> 44:25.655
Book Saints?

44:26.015 --> 44:34.228
This is the first printed book.

44:35.390 --> 44:36.612
This is the first of April.

44:37.182 --> 44:44.730
I'm printing black and red, which is early for printing with color.

44:44.911 --> 44:46.572
And tell me what the title of this book is.

44:49.376 --> 44:52.179
Or Trithemius.

44:53.660 --> 44:54.221
So this is it?

44:55.162 --> 44:56.303
Polygraphiae.

44:57.985 --> 45:00.608
So this is another copy of the book you showed me earlier, right?

45:00.925 --> 45:02.467
Is this another copy of it?

45:03.428 --> 45:05.591
Did you show me a polygraphy already?

45:05.611 --> 45:07.554
Yeah, it's in a different book entirely.

45:07.574 --> 45:07.774
Okay.

45:07.834 --> 45:10.818
This is a polygraphy.

45:11.198 --> 45:15.464
We read sex.

45:15.504 --> 45:15.704
Okay.

45:15.784 --> 45:17.687
Six books.

45:17.707 --> 45:20.130
This is the woodcut, the famous woodcut.

45:20.150 --> 45:20.811
That's magnificent.

45:20.831 --> 45:21.572
Shows the author.

45:21.952 --> 45:23.254
This one was...

45:24.314 --> 45:26.117
The Abbot of the Monastery.

45:26.137 --> 45:26.978
He's famous.

45:27.078 --> 45:31.123
He willed against... He was known as a father of bibliography.

45:32.345 --> 45:33.747
He published the first bibliography.

45:33.947 --> 45:34.608
Tritemius.

45:34.929 --> 45:37.693
Tritemius, yes.

45:37.713 --> 45:44.062
Just a second, I'll make this one a check.

45:44.082 --> 45:46.565
So go ahead, you can keep describing that.

45:47.246 --> 45:52.313
He was known as a father of bibliography.

45:52.512 --> 46:18.773
of course he was the author of the bibliography of books and it's a very printed book johannes the davis and this woodcutt shows him presenting a copy of his book to the emperor that time he was surrounded by other

46:19.597 --> 46:21.479
people from the monastery.

46:21.780 --> 46:22.821
And what's the year on this?

46:22.841 --> 46:23.982
1518.

46:24.042 --> 46:25.624
And it was published where?

46:26.165 --> 46:33.053
It was published in Basel, Switzerland.

46:33.253 --> 46:39.260
Excellent.

46:39.280 --> 46:43.225
These are various alphabets, and also numerical.

46:43.542 --> 47:06.377
uh code where did you get this book for booksellers yeah there's your coliform right there right there that's wonderful look at how beautiful it's yeah it survived is there any chance um we're going to get a cut

47:19.267 --> 47:26.174
And notice the initial letters.

47:26.435 --> 47:27.356
Uh-huh.

47:27.476 --> 47:28.997
Special woodcuts.

47:29.017 --> 47:29.177
Mm-hmm.

47:30.098 --> 47:39.629
Heading each chapter is a gorgeous book.

47:39.649 --> 47:40.509
Okay.

47:40.529 --> 47:41.450
You know, I can call you.

47:41.531 --> 47:45.074
Why don't you give me your address so I can send you the high-pepper book?

47:45.094 --> 47:46.035
Yeah.

47:46.776 --> 47:47.877
It's 425.

47:48.458 --> 47:48.598
Mm-hmm.

47:49.945 --> 48:00.040
Ovington, O-V-I-N-G, Ovington Avenue, Brooklyn, 11209.

48:00.541 --> 48:06.610
Give me your phone number again, 718.

48:06.670 --> 48:10.015
718-238-8141.

48:10.315 --> 48:12.839
And you like to be called at 5 o'clock?

48:13.340 --> 48:15.122
Not 5 o'clock, that's when we have our dinner.

48:15.242 --> 48:16.965
Okay.

48:19.190 --> 48:26.477
I'd say between 4 and 4.30.

48:27.958 --> 48:33.723
And after dinner, between 6 and 9 o'clock.

48:33.943 --> 48:35.084
Okay.

48:35.104 --> 48:35.244
Good.

48:35.405 --> 48:40.829
Because I'll probably want to go over a few times a few hours to make sure I have a break, you know.

48:40.850 --> 48:47.676
In fact, you can come down there and pay me the visit you want, and you can be my guest at dinner in the dining hall.

48:47.696 --> 48:48.336
Well, that'd be nice.

48:48.937 --> 48:49.197
Yeah.

48:49.733 --> 48:52.117
You should let me know when you're in town.

48:52.137 --> 48:52.237
Sure.

48:52.257 --> 48:57.645
But in the meantime, I want to send you a copy of the hardcover, and if you'd like, I'd inscribe it to you in the meantime.

48:57.705 --> 48:59.948
Well, you can bring it with you the next time you come in.

48:59.968 --> 49:00.769
Well, let me mail it.

49:00.789 --> 49:01.330
In the near future.

49:01.551 --> 49:02.071
That's good.

49:02.091 --> 49:05.617
Yeah, let me mail this to you so you can.

49:05.637 --> 49:08.080
Now, this is a bibliography of your collection?

49:08.601 --> 49:14.610
Of my collection and all the other books that aren't in my collection.

49:14.860 --> 49:17.663
That's an annotated bibliography of cryptography.

49:17.944 --> 49:19.025
This is your book.

49:19.045 --> 49:19.466
1976.

49:19.486 --> 49:20.167
Who published this?

49:20.187 --> 49:20.607
Garland?

49:20.867 --> 49:22.029
Garland Publishing Company.

49:22.209 --> 49:27.215
They specialize in bibliography.

49:27.235 --> 49:35.085
Annotated bibliography of cryptography.

49:35.245 --> 49:36.747
That's David Woodcock.

49:37.028 --> 49:38.870
Here's the Woodcock.

49:38.890 --> 49:40.892
Maybe you'll see your middle initial.

49:40.912 --> 49:43.736
No, he's middle initial.

49:43.756 --> 49:44.597
That's Garland.

49:45.151 --> 49:46.994
Yeah.

49:47.034 --> 49:47.675
1976.

49:51.441 --> 49:52.863
There's another David Shulman.

49:52.903 --> 49:54.926
He's been writing books about India.

49:54.946 --> 49:55.367
Finance.

49:56.348 --> 49:59.754
I did a search, and a lot of David Shulmans show up in finance.

50:00.856 --> 50:02.158
Yeah, in finance.

50:02.919 --> 50:06.665
In this particular David Shulman, he has no middle initial.

50:06.845 --> 50:11.412
He offers several books devoted to Hindu literature, folklore, and so on.

50:11.594 --> 50:14.618
He's the winner of an Arthur Foundation Prize.

50:14.638 --> 50:17.162
If I could get this stuff, it would really help me.

50:17.282 --> 50:18.164
Oh, okay.

50:18.384 --> 50:20.247
And Miriam just left to do the other stuff.

50:20.367 --> 50:20.747
Oh, good.

50:20.788 --> 50:24.733
Just so I want to come to write a book.

50:24.773 --> 50:39.475
The Duzzi is based on the shortening of Duesenberg, the expensive car of the 1920s.

50:39.792 --> 50:41.874
a luxury automobile.

50:42.995 --> 50:53.845
I found, before 1920, around 1903, the Duesenberg was just a twinkle in an inventor's eye later on.

50:54.626 --> 51:02.993
In 1903, the doozy was an expression that was being used for the same as, it's a daisy.

51:03.734 --> 51:06.877
I consider that doozy as just an alteration or a corruption.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.298
Have you submitted that?

51:08.338 --> 51:09.259
Is that in now?

51:09.577 --> 51:18.848
Now, you see, doo-wop, they got that, and doozy should be in here.

51:19.669 --> 51:20.369
They omitted it.

51:21.551 --> 51:23.253
So now it's going to be in there.

51:23.613 --> 51:25.996
It's in their computer for the next edition.

51:26.917 --> 51:37.609
When I asked them why had they overlooked it, the editor, John Simpson, wrote to me saying, we were waiting for your citation.

51:37.825 --> 51:40.169
And then they have blind spots.

51:40.349 --> 51:41.271
Something that happens.

51:41.531 --> 51:45.478
At one time, the word carefree was in no dictionary whatsoever.

51:45.559 --> 51:46.140
Carefree.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.001
Yeah.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.043
You know another one I've read?

51:48.784 --> 51:50.467
Scrubwoman, likewise.

51:50.487 --> 51:53.813
It was charwoman that they visited had ignored scrubber.

51:54.674 --> 51:58.040
And snowman was not anything.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.042
Is that one that you put in?

51:59.303 --> 51:59.623
Snowman?

51:59.643 --> 52:02.989
I called it to their attention in a letter to the New York Times.

52:03.307 --> 52:04.408
That's printed.

52:04.428 --> 52:07.452
How about, I understand a word that is very recent as seafood.

52:07.472 --> 52:09.575
That's an Americanism, seafood.

52:09.595 --> 52:10.055
Seafood.

52:10.316 --> 52:12.939
Yeah, that's a fairly recent word, isn't it?

52:23.612 --> 52:25.895
It could be one word, it could be two words.

52:25.915 --> 52:28.318
It could be a compound, it could be hyphenated.

52:29.817 --> 52:31.258
We're trying to see.

52:31.278 --> 52:35.822
But that's, I mean, we're talking about fish, but it's, you know, obviously they came up with seafood.

52:50.795 --> 52:52.276
Sea.

52:52.296 --> 52:57.601
Sea elephants.

52:57.821 --> 52:59.082
They do have one word.

52:59.450 --> 53:01.460
But they say, look at that.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.163
1836.

53:02.183 --> 53:04.414
So that's the earliest you can, so that guy goes back.

53:04.434 --> 53:05.077
They have fun.

53:05.177 --> 53:06.041
Yeah, they've got it.

53:06.081 --> 53:06.684
Yeah, okay, good.

53:07.508 --> 53:08.192
But it's a U.S.

53:08.212 --> 53:08.734
word.
