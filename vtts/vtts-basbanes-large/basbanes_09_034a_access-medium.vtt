00:02.478 --> 00:07.365
They're talking to James Salter.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.268
Let me just put this over here.

00:09.288 --> 00:14.695
I read in your PW interview, you mentioned that you kept a journal while you were in Korea.

00:14.896 --> 00:15.196
Yes.

00:15.597 --> 00:17.359
But this book is recollection.

00:18.581 --> 00:20.544
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you can't have a pony.

00:21.205 --> 00:29.076
I mean, it's certainly not done entirely from memory because it would be quite inaccurate.

00:29.410 --> 00:30.111
if it were.

00:30.251 --> 00:33.856
But I thought that maybe you wanted to rely on memory.

00:33.876 --> 00:34.657
No.

00:35.197 --> 00:35.498
Well.

00:36.139 --> 00:39.163
Because sometimes the things that you remember are probably the most important.

00:39.383 --> 00:40.584
That's true.

00:40.845 --> 00:46.872
And I did rely on memory, that is to say, to identify the things, but to render them accurately.

00:47.193 --> 00:48.515
I used everything I could.

00:49.055 --> 00:53.581
Letters, journal, newspapers, talking to people, whatever.

00:54.042 --> 00:56.805
But it was the selection of things that was memory.

00:56.845 --> 00:57.907
Do you know what I mean?

00:57.927 --> 00:58.928
I know exactly what you mean.

00:59.431 --> 01:04.078
I never kept notes when I was in the service, for instance, and I regret it tremendously.

01:04.299 --> 01:05.140
That's too bad.

01:05.541 --> 01:18.361
I've got a pretty good memory, but I've often thought, if I came to write a book about, it's a very interesting time, I would call that book, Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club, which is the patch we all wore.

01:18.381 --> 01:22.367
It's a great title for an aircraft carrier store.

01:22.668 --> 01:24.551
You know, I didn't keep it dry.

01:24.571 --> 01:26.553
Well, a lot goes away from you if you don't.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.177
And you lose a lot of very, very... Well, you lose the detail.

01:29.317 --> 01:29.557
Yeah.

01:29.838 --> 01:32.341
I mean, you remember certain key things, of course.

01:32.361 --> 01:34.965
May I have some hot water in there?

01:35.205 --> 01:35.886
Nothing more.

01:35.926 --> 01:38.770
Just scalding water.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.133
Thank you.

01:41.153 --> 01:43.917
You said that your years...

01:44.285 --> 01:47.350
in the military as a pilot were the defining years.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.274
I don't know if that's the exact phrase that you've used.

01:50.314 --> 01:56.944
Maybe it's the, not the defining years, but the voyage of your life.

01:57.085 --> 01:57.405
Yes.

01:57.966 --> 01:59.228
Well, that's a bit different.

01:59.248 --> 02:01.792
That is a bit different.

02:01.812 --> 02:02.032
Yeah.

02:02.152 --> 02:06.299
Well, defining years, I would say... That was my paraphrase, which was one.

02:06.319 --> 02:07.280
Okay.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.485
Well, I mean, defining years, I would say, would be school years, essentially.

02:10.966 --> 02:12.368
But after school...

02:12.584 --> 02:16.288
you go out on the voyage, and that happened to be mine.

02:20.212 --> 02:21.533
So who knows what defines you?

02:21.573 --> 02:25.597
I mean, no, you're defined early, I believe, but you make refinement.

02:25.617 --> 02:28.440
You know, there can be adjustments in it as you go along.

02:29.621 --> 02:33.866
But the voyage of your life, could you expand a little bit on that by what you mean?

02:34.566 --> 02:38.430
Well... Beyond the metaphor?

02:38.450 --> 02:42.034
Not really without crushing the metaphor, but...

02:42.284 --> 02:50.517
The voyage of my life actually refers to that tour, to the combat tour in Korea, more than to the whole business of flying.

02:51.118 --> 03:04.260
So I volunteered to go, but I was a regular officer, and we were eager to go as pilots.

03:05.963 --> 03:08.106
You know, it was essential in a way.

03:08.947 --> 03:11.770
And I volunteered to go, and who knew what would happen?

03:13.472 --> 03:17.376
So all those things happened to me that are in that particular chapter.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.238
It's called The Singledarian Act.

03:19.258 --> 03:26.945
The chapter title comes from Melville, as a matter of fact, from Taipei, where he talks about something or other.

03:26.966 --> 03:29.668
The Singledarian Act had put him on the other side.

03:29.989 --> 03:32.391
I don't remember the exact quotation.

03:32.451 --> 03:38.177
I mean, I have it in my notebook, but not in my memory.

03:38.528 --> 03:47.941
And the Singledarian Act refers to an act of Kastler, a guy who was in my flight, who became an ace, wonderful pilot, famous, as a matter of fact.

03:48.282 --> 03:54.731
He won three Air Force crosses, which is the equivalent of, it's above the DSC.

03:55.051 --> 03:57.955
No, it's the equivalent of the DSC, I believe.

03:58.276 --> 04:06.828
That's to say the highest declaration below the Congressional Medal, and I believe the only individual ever to have done that, Kastler.

04:06.848 --> 04:08.350
In any case...

04:09.072 --> 04:14.880
The tour, the combat tour, was all I might have imagined and more.

04:15.361 --> 04:20.888
And to have done it and then left, that's what I referred to as.

04:20.908 --> 04:25.294
I had said it had been a great voyage, the voyage probably of my life.

04:25.595 --> 04:25.935
I agree.

04:26.776 --> 04:33.105
Actually, I think these things that happened, and also it's the event of regeneration probably.

04:33.389 --> 04:36.915
Um, well, no.

04:36.995 --> 04:38.397
It wasn't like the Vietnam War.

04:38.697 --> 04:40.520
Well, I don't recall it that well.

04:40.540 --> 04:44.787
But you see, you didn't participate in the Vietnam War.

04:44.807 --> 04:48.272
That was after your watch.

04:48.292 --> 04:49.174
After my watch.

04:49.194 --> 05:01.573
But the thing is that the Korean War was overshadowed by the Second World War, which had just ended with all its tremendous, you know,

05:02.397 --> 05:13.717
drama of every kind, and then came this remote and unpopular and, to some people, somewhat pointless war.

05:13.777 --> 05:20.389
That was quite different, because then, after a long period, then more than ten years later,

05:21.010 --> 05:22.212
in a period of peace.

05:23.334 --> 05:25.978
Well, the Cold War was on, but that's not really a war.

05:26.599 --> 05:28.862
In a period of peace came Vietnam.

05:28.882 --> 05:31.887
I think it stood out more, and it was much longer.

05:32.307 --> 05:37.776
Didn't Vietnam go on for about eight years, nine or ten years?

05:37.956 --> 05:44.667
And the domestic aspect of the war was completely different than the Korean War.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.950
I mean, it was a watershed.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.546
in American society, and the Korean War was really not.

05:51.566 --> 06:04.525
It was merely, you know, I don't want to say a two-for-a-penny war, because as many people were killed in Korea, almost, the casualty figures are about the same, but it wasn't.

06:04.545 --> 06:11.115
In terms of the domestic consequences and the world consequences, but when I meant the event,

06:11.399 --> 06:16.207
The event of your generation in which you could participate, I guess, is what I think.

06:16.267 --> 06:19.792
Well, I was old enough to have fought in the Second War, but I didn't.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.695
I was commissioned just as it was over.

06:21.756 --> 06:26.563
That was really, I would say, the event, truly the event of my generation.

06:26.663 --> 06:32.232
I didn't write about it because I wasn't in it, but I still think in terms of it.

06:33.334 --> 06:33.695
Really?

06:33.895 --> 06:35.077
Yes, it's inevitable.

06:35.097 --> 06:38.402
You simply, you know, the big events of your life,

06:38.787 --> 06:43.195
You cannot exchange for anything else at the world events.

06:43.215 --> 06:52.030
You just can't switch and say, well, now I'm going to start thinking that it was the Kennedy assassination that was the big event of my life.

06:52.050 --> 06:54.935
But it wasn't, because it came much later.

06:55.135 --> 06:56.417
For me, it was totally the 60s.

06:56.437 --> 07:01.386
I graduated high school in 61, college in 65, went to graduate school in

07:02.193 --> 07:07.020
service from 68 to 71, 68, 68.

07:07.620 --> 07:10.865
Everything happened to me in the 1960s.

07:10.885 --> 07:15.291
But I believe, wouldn't it be true that that is your essential reference in life?

07:15.331 --> 07:15.752
Absolutely.

07:16.272 --> 07:17.834
Well, that's what I'm saying.

07:17.854 --> 07:25.224
The Second World War, even though I didn't fight in it, was really mine.

07:25.345 --> 07:29.390
So to use that word defining again, that almost was a defining event.

07:29.470 --> 07:30.732
Very defining, yes.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.259
It came during school.

07:32.319 --> 07:39.094
School was defined in that war all at the same time.

07:39.114 --> 07:49.176
You mentioned, and you give great credit to Joe Fox for eliciting this book out of you, but did he encourage you as to the shape that you take as recollections as opposed to a memoir?

07:49.677 --> 07:50.880
No.

07:51.923 --> 07:55.487
I was one of Fox's two favorites that he still had.

07:55.867 --> 07:58.991
I mean, he had had lots of writers of importance.

07:59.091 --> 08:07.100
I mean, he edited Capote, Philip Roth, many, you know, in the first rank.

08:07.621 --> 08:17.492
But by the time, in the last 20 years of his life, he had a lot of successful books, of course, but among literary writers,

08:17.692 --> 08:20.676
I was one of the two that he liked.

08:20.696 --> 08:21.037
And the other?

08:21.057 --> 08:30.290
Well, the other that he was tremendously fond of and thought she'd get a Nobel Prize, as a matter of fact, was Mavis Galant, the Canadian writer who lives in Paris.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.735
Of course, she wrote a lot for him.

08:33.895 --> 08:35.317
I wrote very little for him.

08:35.357 --> 08:38.742
He only edited one book of mine, Turn Down Two.

08:38.802 --> 08:39.903
You're killing him.

08:40.424 --> 08:40.484
No.

08:40.504 --> 08:41.185
And...

08:41.587 --> 08:45.259
And then Wanda encouraged me to write the third.

08:45.299 --> 08:50.877
But when it came to the third, no, he didn't say, I think you should do this or that.

08:50.918 --> 08:53.807
He said, you write it.

08:54.209 --> 08:56.271
No, I have confidence in it.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.434
Well, he didn't say I have confidence in it.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.195
He just said that.

08:59.215 --> 09:02.078
That didn't seem to be his way to have confidence in it.

09:02.098 --> 09:04.981
Martin Cruz Smith was, of course, his author, too.

09:05.402 --> 09:06.963
Well, I didn't call him a literary.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.245
I mean, he is.

09:08.325 --> 09:09.566
I suppose he is, really.

09:09.586 --> 09:10.888
He's sort of on that book alone.

09:10.908 --> 09:11.989
He's not a literary.

09:12.009 --> 09:17.415
But he writes a very high-level, well, you know what I mean.

09:17.435 --> 09:18.336
I know precisely what you mean.

09:18.356 --> 09:22.321
By literary author, I mean a respected writer who doesn't sell any books.

09:22.341 --> 09:23.322
Yeah, well...

09:23.605 --> 09:24.266
That's funny.

09:27.089 --> 09:31.395
You did say to some... Cruise sells a lot, yes.

09:31.415 --> 09:35.940
You did say to someone that you're tired of being called a writer's writer.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.262
Well, I don't know why.

09:37.322 --> 09:42.488
I mean, that's... But everybody certainly has the greatest respect for you.

09:43.850 --> 09:52.381
Well, but I mean, the critics and people who interviews her and so forth go back to the file, so to speak, and they say, ah, writer's writer.

09:52.421 --> 09:52.701
Well...

09:52.968 --> 09:53.849
and they pick it up.

09:53.950 --> 09:55.392
I think that's the way it happens.

09:56.534 --> 09:58.997
Did you know Richard Yates, who lived around here in Boston?

09:59.378 --> 09:59.538
No.

09:59.678 --> 10:00.820
Did you know his work at all?

10:00.880 --> 10:01.221
A bit.

10:01.321 --> 10:01.702
Yeah.

10:02.062 --> 10:03.565
He had Revolutionary Road.

10:03.585 --> 10:06.229
Revolutionary Road, 11 Kinds of Loneliness.

10:06.249 --> 10:13.440
I remember talking with Dick Yates right over at the Crossroads, a bar that he liked over there.

10:13.876 --> 10:15.779
over there, actually, that's Boston over there.

10:17.481 --> 10:23.149
And he said, if I knew how to write, believe me, if I knew how to write a bestseller, I would do it tonight.

10:23.369 --> 10:24.050
Of course.

10:24.070 --> 10:27.594
And, you know, he said, but I can only write the way I know how to write.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.797
Do you subscribe to that?

10:29.898 --> 10:30.358
Oh, sure.

10:30.378 --> 10:31.760
I mean, I think that's self-evident.

10:31.780 --> 10:40.592
You know, I think it was Jules Renard who said, if I'm going to translate the French, roughly, he said, you can...

10:40.859 --> 10:44.064
tell stories as you like, anecdotes, stories.

10:44.584 --> 10:49.531
You can entertain as you like, but you cannot write as you like.

10:50.392 --> 10:52.215
You can only write what you are.

10:53.116 --> 10:53.477
That's great.

10:53.977 --> 10:55.940
And I think that's essentially true.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.143
And the rest of this, once again, is it?

10:58.223 --> 11:01.148
Jules Renard, R-E-N-A-R-D.

11:01.368 --> 11:03.311
Go ahead.

11:03.331 --> 11:04.032
I interrupted you.

11:04.052 --> 11:06.175
You were going to say something.

11:06.195 --> 11:06.495
I'm sorry.

11:07.454 --> 11:13.120
I think he said, on peut compter comme on veut, or something like that.

11:13.501 --> 11:21.870
On peut pas écrire comme on veut, on peut écrire ce que on est, or what you are.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.492
My French is probably lousy.

11:23.512 --> 11:25.253
I'm going to have a ball transcribing that one.

11:25.273 --> 11:26.134
Well, no, no.

11:26.775 --> 11:29.458
Don't, because the French is all wrong, I'm sure.

11:32.281 --> 11:35.585
Well, yeah, but I mean, you hear this story all the time.

11:35.925 --> 11:36.786
In fact...

11:37.525 --> 11:45.798
I'm sure this happens to every writer because I can remember having dinner with Fox saying, Christ, I could write a book like that.

11:46.098 --> 11:48.181
I said, he said, you couldn't possibly.

11:48.762 --> 11:53.790
He said, you have to believe in that to be able to write it when you don't.

11:54.371 --> 11:55.553
And I think that's true.

11:55.613 --> 11:57.596
I agree with that, actually.

11:57.636 --> 11:59.719
For the longest time, you resisted.

12:00.155 --> 12:02.537
allowing the first two books to be reissued.

12:02.577 --> 12:17.171
I guess in the first book, finally, you're... Could you tell me why that is, and then what prompted you to change your... Well, I didn't think it was worthy of being reissued, it seemed to me.

12:18.493 --> 12:25.960
I wouldn't call it an insult to the public, but there are plenty of books out there, and it was the first book, useful in many ways.

12:26.176 --> 12:33.845
And although I thought the story was good, I didn't think the writing was measured up to what... I didn't really learn to write to my third book.

12:34.746 --> 12:36.428
And this was the first one.

12:36.508 --> 12:49.242
But the former editor-in-chief of North Point, Jack Shoemaker, a man I have a tremendous amount of respect for, kept after me and said, no, you're being too hard on yourself.

12:49.262 --> 12:50.083
That's not true.

12:50.564 --> 12:51.965
It is an awfully good book.

12:51.985 --> 12:52.826
I know it is.

12:52.846 --> 12:55.069
And I finally agreed to...

12:55.336 --> 12:59.621
having published it, he would let me revise it to take out some of the worst.

12:59.641 --> 13:02.524
So you did go, so this was, you're anticipating my question here.

13:02.885 --> 13:03.565
Go ahead.

13:03.585 --> 13:04.927
This is very interesting.

13:05.147 --> 13:13.597
Well, to take out the inadvertencies or what I thought were, you know, baby fat, let us say.

13:14.198 --> 13:18.783
And so I did the best I could, and he reissued it.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.685
I have been astonished.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.484
at what happened.

13:23.725 --> 13:28.173
You know, first of all, it's the republication of a book.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.116
It's not a new book, of course.

13:30.456 --> 13:31.959
But you tinkered with it, though?

13:32.139 --> 13:33.221
I tinkered with it.

13:33.261 --> 13:34.984
He got a lot of reviews.

13:35.425 --> 13:38.751
It got front-page reviews in certain places.

13:38.771 --> 13:40.234
It's in its third printing now.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.235
Does this astonish you?

13:41.255 --> 13:45.142
Yes, of course, and it's probably going to go into a fourth or fifth.

13:45.162 --> 13:45.643
Isn't that great?

13:46.079 --> 13:47.541
That's wonderful.

13:48.202 --> 13:57.957
Yes, of course it's wonderful, but it makes me feel a bit foolish because I said never in a hundred years, but I was quite wrong.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.103
Do you think maybe you're too self-critical about your work?

14:02.363 --> 14:07.230
Yes, I am, but there I didn't think I was wrong, but I guess I was.

14:07.631 --> 14:11.396
You know what Mencken said, gentlemen, I was mistaken.

14:12.578 --> 14:15.883
But Galileo was the one who said, look, I'll say I'm sorry, but...

14:16.252 --> 14:21.522
but the planets still go around the sun.

14:21.662 --> 14:24.708
You know, sometimes it's self-evident.

14:25.489 --> 14:31.280
So clearly, I've interviewed authors before, and it's an interesting concept to me.

14:31.741 --> 14:34.146
Do you consider completed work completed work as work?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.809
You know, it was your first novel.

14:35.829 --> 14:38.614
You've even gone so far as to suggest it was Juvenalia.

14:38.864 --> 14:41.568
and maybe it should be taken in that context.

14:41.968 --> 14:49.479
What prompts you at this point in your life to want to go back and tinker with something that you wrote 40-odd years ago?

14:49.539 --> 14:51.783
Well, I say I was persuaded by an editor.

14:51.863 --> 14:52.704
But to tinker with it.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.570
Well, I didn't want to let it go as it had been.

14:57.311 --> 15:02.138
Certain things I knew were wrong with it, and I changed them.

15:02.178 --> 15:05.262
He wanted me to write a preface for it to explain.

15:05.543 --> 15:07.285
Not to explain, but to...

15:07.805 --> 15:10.148
helped the reader a bit.

15:10.168 --> 15:10.749
And I did.

15:11.069 --> 15:12.631
And I thought, he wasn't the only one.

15:12.891 --> 15:18.799
The book had, I don't want to say a cult following, because even the word cult makes it sound too numerous.

15:19.299 --> 15:29.993
But I have had letters over the years, letters over the years saying, would you mind if I Xerox several copies of it, because people and so forth.

15:30.053 --> 15:37.542
And then in France, I had a call from, there's a French writer, perhaps you've heard of him, named...

15:38.703 --> 15:39.945
Pierre Klosterman.

15:40.566 --> 15:45.973
He wrote a book right after, bestseller, quite an educated man and a good writer.

15:46.353 --> 15:50.599
He was a fighter pilot in the Second War, and he wrote a book called The Big Circus.

15:50.619 --> 15:51.200
I know that.

15:51.220 --> 15:51.621
I know that.

15:51.981 --> 15:54.464
Well, it was a big, it was a huge success.

15:55.065 --> 15:57.889
Klosterman went on to write seven or eight other books.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.913
He became a deputy to the assembly.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.897
He's a head of, I don't know, international fishing.

16:03.917 --> 16:04.178
I don't know.

16:04.198 --> 16:07.322
He's a man of many, you know, accomplishments.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.203
He called me.

16:08.420 --> 16:33.634
one day and said uh and he speaks english of course quite well and he said well you know i your book is ever published here i would love to write a forward for it this was before it was reissued in america so you know these things add up and you begin to say i'm not as smart perhaps i'm not as good a judge of these things as i thought so

16:34.643 --> 16:45.654
Tim O'Brien who wrote Going After Cacciato, which is the Vietnam book, and I did interview him in fact writing this building with him, his most recent book.

16:45.674 --> 16:51.000
Again, the Vietnam War is seared, I mean, his experiences.

16:51.020 --> 16:55.224
But he has very quietly gone back and fooled around with Cacciato.

16:55.244 --> 16:57.106
It was a book that won the National Booking Award.

16:57.146 --> 17:03.773
In fact, he said he got a letter from a teacher who was in a course, and he was reading the hardcover.

17:03.871 --> 17:12.025
And the students were reading the paperback, and they were saying, we're not reading the same, you know, we're not reading the same book, because he had made changes very quietly.

17:12.292 --> 17:18.360
And I said, Tim, don't you feel that this book represents where you were, what you were at that point in your life?

17:18.921 --> 17:20.864
And I guess I'm asking you the same question.

17:21.144 --> 17:24.529
Oh, but that's making a monument of that.

17:24.569 --> 17:28.814
He said, my responsibility is to make the best work of art that I can.

17:28.895 --> 17:29.876
He said, that's what I feel.

17:30.256 --> 17:34.402
And, you know, so I guess we're all entitled to different opinions on it.

17:34.422 --> 17:38.307
Yeah, well, I wouldn't call, I wouldn't use the term work of art myself.

17:38.848 --> 17:41.792
But, no, no, I agree with O'Brien.

17:42.042 --> 17:47.389
that if it can be improved, and you have the opportunity.

17:47.730 --> 18:04.793
I mean, it's not like Bonnard, who was known for carrying a little tin of paints in his jacket, and when he went to the home of a collector and happened to see one of his paintings, he was not above going up and making some... Oh, that's wonderful.

18:04.813 --> 18:05.554
No, that's true.

18:05.574 --> 18:06.416
Oh, yeah, quite true.

18:06.436 --> 18:07.998
I might use that.

18:08.018 --> 18:11.863
Well, it's exactly what O'Brien did, and in a sense what I did.

18:12.113 --> 18:12.994
as well, yes.

18:13.454 --> 18:16.157
So, no, why not?

18:16.397 --> 18:24.885
Well, when Henry James was bringing out the New York edition of his works, he was just supposed to be writing prefaces, and he's going in there, and he's fooling around.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.346
Well, I think he wanted to do that.

18:26.907 --> 18:30.510
I mean... That's interesting, you know.

18:30.550 --> 18:37.457
You get a lot of opposite views on that from other novelists, you know.

18:37.557 --> 18:38.678
What would be the...

18:38.962 --> 18:43.970
The completed work is completed work, and why go back to something that you finished?

18:43.990 --> 18:45.793
Why not go ahead and do something new?

18:45.813 --> 18:50.240
This represents who I was at that point in my life and at that stage of my development.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.245
Well, that's a very self-important attitude, really.

18:53.566 --> 19:03.903
Perhaps that's okay in the case of a Leonardo, but in lesser cases, I would say the book is the primary thing and not what it represents historically.

19:04.323 --> 19:06.066
If the book can be made...

19:06.350 --> 19:11.097
a little bit more interesting, I wouldn't hesitate to do that.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.962
I mean, there's a limit, I think, to tinkering.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.666
You finally abandon these things, isn't that right?

19:16.746 --> 19:23.296
I mean, you reach a certain point and you say, that's as much, that's as good as I can make it.

19:24.377 --> 19:26.160
Or as good as I want to make it, one or the other.

19:27.202 --> 19:28.003
Well, okay.

19:28.524 --> 19:29.846
Because sometimes you say, I've had it.

19:30.046 --> 19:30.907
Yes, yes.

19:31.248 --> 19:34.112
Well, you may lose heart in a way.

19:34.295 --> 19:38.340
But it depends how tenacious you are or how important the work is.

19:38.781 --> 19:48.634
I mean, you can't do that with a newspaper column, obviously, but if it's a book, you may stick at it, stay at it longer.

19:48.855 --> 19:55.624
I know with my book I was tinkering, tinkering, tinkering up until the day the thing went off and they ordered me not to call them anymore.

19:55.644 --> 19:58.688
Well, I think that's true.

19:58.708 --> 20:03.795
Because we've had six plittings, I've actually been able to go in and fix things.

20:03.893 --> 20:04.814
And I don't hesitate.

20:04.914 --> 20:07.157
This is a work of non-fiction, not an album.

20:07.517 --> 20:13.184
Well, I am going to make some changes in the paperback edition.

20:13.204 --> 20:14.746
Yes, and I'm making some changes.

20:14.766 --> 20:16.027
Substantive ones?

20:16.047 --> 20:16.247
No.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.071
I mean, well, they're substantive to me.

20:19.451 --> 20:30.804
Probably unnoticeable to the average reader, but things that I think... Well, stylistic in the writing, or things that you're going to add in terms of... No, I'm going to add a little bit and change just a word or two.

20:31.025 --> 20:33.107
Everything counts.

20:33.475 --> 20:36.039
you know, even in a long book.

20:37.882 --> 20:38.623
Do you give readings?

20:39.605 --> 20:40.025
Oh, yeah.

20:40.045 --> 20:42.028
Have you ever attempted to change things as you're reading?

20:42.088 --> 20:42.469
I do.

20:42.990 --> 20:43.451
Do you?

20:43.471 --> 20:45.113
Oh, sure.

20:45.133 --> 20:53.546
And depending what the audience looks like also, you may leave out a word or make a contraction or one thing or another.

20:53.566 --> 20:56.631
Yeah, very interesting.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.262
Excuse me, I hope you don't mind going off.

20:59.442 --> 21:01.505
I grew up on lentil soup, too, by the way.

21:01.525 --> 21:04.588
I happen to say my mother made wonderful lentil soup when I was there.

21:04.769 --> 21:07.412
Oh, do I mention lentil soup?

21:07.492 --> 21:08.873
Oh, my grandmother.

21:08.913 --> 21:10.315
My grandmother made it, yeah.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.797
It wasn't really that good.

21:12.578 --> 21:13.459
But I was a kid.

21:13.519 --> 21:15.140
You remember it with affection, though.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.623
Well, I was a kid and didn't know any better.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.125
It was very clear.

21:19.105 --> 21:48.724
a lentil soup i bet you know you can see i thought that was more greek well dark yes dark and there was sometimes with carrots you described learning are you a product of your reading would you say have you been shaped by the books that you've read you talk about learning sex from books for instance from a family yeah very early on yeah and to expand that

21:49.126 --> 21:55.221
The reason I ask the question is very selfish.

21:55.302 --> 22:00.655
A chapter in my new book is I'm really fascinated by people who can really palpably

22:01.293 --> 22:04.016
shaped by the books that they've read.

22:05.638 --> 22:13.087
Well, Virginia Woolf never went to school, you know, and everything she became for the reading.

22:13.167 --> 22:17.372
Shaw read at the British Library at his university, you know.

22:17.773 --> 22:19.595
Well, I mean, I think that's quite true.

22:20.056 --> 22:31.249
Probably the finest education, not technical, of course, but the finest liberal education would come from reading because...

22:31.415 --> 22:50.960
The books will tell you things that you're not going to learn any other way, and tell you in terms that are marvelous, that just don't, are not so clarified in life, not so, you know, you cannot... So I would say the answer is yes.

22:51.921 --> 23:00.612
But there's another part to the, I mean, another aspect to the question,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.942
Which is, would you have been different?

23:03.844 --> 23:07.067
Have they changed your character, so to speak?

23:07.148 --> 23:08.509
I don't believe they do that.

23:08.910 --> 23:10.291
I believe they broaden you.

23:10.612 --> 23:12.694
They change your soul, but not your character.

23:13.676 --> 23:14.176
That's excellent.

23:15.378 --> 23:19.743
Because I think in your case, your writing really does reflect your experience.

23:20.924 --> 23:24.068
More so, perhaps, even... Here, you mean, or everywhere?

23:24.349 --> 23:24.709
Everywhere.

23:24.993 --> 23:33.687
Well... Your books have reflected the things that have happened in your life from when it's... Well, to some extent, I mean, they're not all autobiographical by any means.

23:33.707 --> 23:41.018
No, but they certainly are influenced by the things that you... That I've seen and done, yes.

23:41.078 --> 23:47.909
But that's the power of fiction, of course, to create something fictional.

23:47.949 --> 23:50.673
That you haven't seen or experienced, in a way?

23:51.414 --> 23:52.536
You know, I...

23:53.309 --> 24:01.541
I'm teaching writing now in this stint at Williams first semester.

24:01.561 --> 24:06.108
I've done it a couple times before at Iowa, actually.

24:06.568 --> 24:13.739
And you were obliged to rethink these things all the time in addressing students and addressing these problems.

24:15.922 --> 24:23.012
I believe in whoever it was that says your job is to invent the truth.

24:23.482 --> 24:52.932
it's not a question of making things up that phrase bothers me a bit i it's true you may be writing down things that haven't happened but they better be the truth despite that and that's what makes a great uh i think a great book or the book the kind of book i like in any case and not only me i would say that that identifies many of the works that we consider

24:53.215 --> 25:18.987
uh you know worth reading enduring so uh they are true but uh hey i i don't want you to talk about reviews uh the reviews have been wonderful on this book but i noticed how they they generally coach and say well this is a book about the male experience have you seen these reviews somewhere like that yeah what's your response to that true

25:19.608 --> 25:27.523
I would say that has a little bit of current fashion and PC-ism and so forth.

25:27.543 --> 25:40.789
Yeah, because I know that the viewer is almost apologizing that he hasn't liked it because it is taking the position of a white, middle-aged guy in the late 20th century.

25:41.562 --> 25:44.866
essentially the most popular people.

25:45.367 --> 25:53.376
Yeah, well, all right, but male sexuality and male issues and these kinds of things.

25:53.536 --> 25:54.938
It's like you have to apologize.

25:55.299 --> 25:55.859
Well, they do.

25:56.400 --> 26:08.194
They are apologetic or a little grudging or a little nervous about liking it too much for fear they'll be attacked from the radical, whatever, left or right.

26:08.883 --> 26:12.007
I don't think that's anything to worry about.

26:12.248 --> 26:24.524
I mean, men's affection for women, such as it is, that's not going to change, no matter what customs dictate at the moment.

26:25.205 --> 26:31.554
I don't think the attitudes in the book are at all a question of my generation.

26:32.095 --> 26:35.920
I think that they are absolutely valid, and...

26:36.254 --> 26:39.637
I'm not concerned about that.

26:39.837 --> 26:41.278
I could be completely wrong.

26:41.379 --> 26:42.600
I was wrong about the hunters.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.323
I could be completely wrong about this, but I don't think so.

26:46.463 --> 26:52.949
I don't think so either, because people are leading it with great pleasure.

26:52.969 --> 26:57.853
The writing is beautiful, and I can see why it took 10 years to write it.

26:57.873 --> 26:58.494
Well, it shouldn't.

26:58.554 --> 27:01.897
It represents really like two and a half years' work, but I'm slow.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.219
Another guy could have

27:04.351 --> 27:05.973
done it probably in a couple of years.

27:05.993 --> 27:07.295
But you had other things to do, right?

27:07.415 --> 27:07.756
I did.

27:07.796 --> 27:14.205
I was trying to earn a little money and teach and I had a kid and I don't know what happens.

27:15.166 --> 27:19.753
I've never completely given up living is the problem.

27:22.496 --> 27:26.522
You haven't really talked about Hollywood and screenwriting and stuff like that.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.848
You've been very critical about your own

27:31.300 --> 27:37.909
I guess you've been quoted as saying there's only one screenplay that you really feel achieved it.

27:38.710 --> 27:41.253
Well, came close to achieving it, I would say.

27:41.273 --> 27:47.361
I suppose it's my nature.

27:47.721 --> 27:53.269
I mean, when something is really good, I usually don't talk about it.

27:53.309 --> 27:54.230
I just let it be.

27:54.250 --> 27:59.637
If it's not quite good, I'm willing to admit that it was my fault or that it could be better.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.781
It didn't make it.

28:01.562 --> 28:04.086
I suppose that's what it amounts to.

28:05.047 --> 28:11.376
Movies are, you know this, and most educated moviegoers, I would think, know this.

28:11.416 --> 28:15.422
They depend so much on the cast and the director, apart from the writer.

28:15.723 --> 28:21.030
The writer is only the initial, you know, the father of it, let us say, in a way.

28:21.050 --> 28:23.093
The producer would claim to be the father.

28:23.360 --> 28:29.068
Actually, the writer provides the, you know, the text for it.

28:29.308 --> 28:33.634
But after that, it's in a lot of other hands that have nothing to do with the writer.

28:33.654 --> 28:36.658
So good scripts are ruined sometimes.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.422
No, that's fine.

28:39.582 --> 28:46.652
Good scripts are ruined by bad luck in casting or by the wrong director and maybe other things as well.

28:47.173 --> 28:53.181
And I would say that I had, my luck wasn't great in film writing.

28:53.262 --> 29:01.956
I can think of a script or maybe a script and a half that would have been much better if it had, would have been good if it had the right people, but it didn't.

29:02.757 --> 29:03.538
And that happens.

29:03.719 --> 29:05.461
You've got to accept that.

29:05.542 --> 29:10.469
Did you feel any kind of a proprietary way about your scripts as you do about your novels?

29:10.790 --> 29:13.394
No, not quite, but I was quite serious about it.

29:13.474 --> 29:18.943
I mean, I did my, I gave them whatever I had to give them.

29:18.963 --> 29:20.265
It wasn't a question of

29:20.667 --> 29:25.832
doing it with my left hand or with my fingers crossed and saying, well, this is nothing but a movie.

29:27.173 --> 29:28.315
So you gave me a shot.

29:28.335 --> 29:31.237
Yes, I did it the way you write a column.

29:31.257 --> 29:32.759
You do the best you can.

29:32.819 --> 29:39.866
And so, no, I didn't approach it cynically and say, well, what's the difference?

29:39.886 --> 29:42.729
It's only a movie, and what do all those unwashed people?

29:43.209 --> 29:43.469
No.

29:45.531 --> 29:47.053
But it doesn't always come out.

29:47.173 --> 29:49.155
I don't, those are the breaks.

29:50.114 --> 29:56.467
I don't, you know, it's partly my fault, partly luck, all those things.

29:56.487 --> 29:59.553
How many films did Faulkner have produced, I wonder?

29:59.613 --> 30:04.563
Did William Faulkner have produced that he did and basically supported him?

30:04.643 --> 30:09.553
Yes, well I know at least one that he wrote, something about the pharaohs, I can't remember.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.397
But other than that, you know,

30:11.849 --> 30:12.370
Yeah.

30:13.432 --> 30:16.016
Well, did you enjoy that work?

30:16.196 --> 30:17.618
Oh, yes.

30:17.758 --> 30:22.105
I think you enjoyed it, especially at the beginning, in the early part of doing it.

30:22.526 --> 30:23.427
It's very exciting.

30:24.048 --> 30:35.747
It's very exciting to have everybody suddenly assuring you that you are quite an important figure and waiting eagerly.

30:36.098 --> 30:37.139
for what you produce.

30:37.460 --> 30:48.615
And then this, you're more than on the fringe, you're meeting a lot of people traveling, the hotels, this and that.

30:48.635 --> 30:57.707
You said earlier in our conversation that, jokingly, but a literary writer is a writer whose books don't sell.

30:59.069 --> 31:03.094
But Jim, but take that half seriously.

31:03.114 --> 31:03.895
Do you think

31:04.415 --> 31:12.463
What is your attitude on the future of serious literature, of literature, of literary novels?

31:12.483 --> 31:21.732
Well, I think overall I would say literature has declined a bit in importance in our culture, in our world.

31:23.774 --> 31:26.317
Will it continue to slip?

31:26.978 --> 31:27.558
I don't know.

31:28.679 --> 31:29.700
Is it a bad thing?

31:30.301 --> 31:31.502
I don't really know.

31:31.972 --> 31:38.679
I think you have to accept it, as you accept change in the seashore or something.

31:38.719 --> 31:40.762
It happened.

31:41.743 --> 31:48.230
Everything that has happened in the second half of the century, technologically, has made a big difference.

31:48.270 --> 31:56.359
And some things that happened in the first half, film for instance, have made a difference.

31:57.031 --> 31:58.273
It's wonderful.

31:58.574 --> 32:08.691
It's like driving in a taxi cab and arguing with the cab driver about whether the baseball team, about what they should have done or not, and is it good or not.

32:10.354 --> 32:11.576
Nobody really knows.

32:12.057 --> 32:15.263
The novel Dead, I wouldn't say that.

32:15.643 --> 32:20.592
Less important than it was when Thackeray was writing, or Henry James.

32:20.774 --> 32:24.605
who was incidentally not one of the most popular writers in his generation.

32:24.626 --> 32:25.769
Or Melville for that matter.

32:25.789 --> 32:28.898
No, I mean, but less important than that?

32:29.239 --> 32:30.463
Yes, probably.

32:30.899 --> 32:34.446
Somebody pointed out Margaret Drabble, I didn't interview with her a couple of years ago.

32:34.506 --> 32:44.484
The fact is, you think of the great Russian novelists, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Reunion, they wrote these wonderful novels at a time when the vast majority of the Russian people couldn't read.

32:45.306 --> 32:52.519
And yet, the literature was still produced, so whether or not, you know, there's a decline in literacy or interest or whatever,

32:53.140 --> 32:56.203
It doesn't necessarily mean that the literature will not be produced.

32:56.503 --> 32:57.124
That's true.

32:57.164 --> 33:02.349
And, of course, the literature is carried on by a small minority of people in any case.

33:02.429 --> 33:02.990
In any case.

33:03.070 --> 33:04.171
In any case.

33:04.191 --> 33:04.952
I think so.

33:05.172 --> 33:11.158
I mean, by academics, by avid readers, by people, book lovers.

33:12.219 --> 33:15.742
So, I don't, it's hard to say.

33:15.902 --> 33:21.848
There seems to be less time to read these days than there was in life.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.574
That's a good point.

33:26.914 --> 33:29.959
But having said all this, do you write with a certain reader in mind?

33:31.902 --> 33:34.967
Well, I write things that I would like to read.

33:35.027 --> 33:38.974
I write things for myself, first of all, that I enjoy reading.

33:39.474 --> 33:46.165
And secondly, I guess I write with a couple of people in mind.

33:46.853 --> 33:53.449
a couple of type of people in mind that I would like, that I can imagine in reading it.

33:53.470 --> 33:53.951
That's all.

33:54.111 --> 34:01.690
If we could, again, discuss why you decided to do a volume of Recollections, and as you say, written...

34:02.108 --> 34:05.491
about certain things, the rest have been now written.

34:05.511 --> 34:15.781
You know, you're basically being very selective about what you're going to write about.

34:15.801 --> 34:19.244
In some other place, I said I was actually was writing light years.

34:19.805 --> 34:30.715
I remember I was... I had in mind something Jean Renoir had said when he said, the only things that are important in life are the things you remember.

34:31.522 --> 34:36.770
That's a charming aphorism, and it's like a mebius.

34:36.790 --> 34:38.152
Is it a mebius strip?

34:38.372 --> 34:43.440
What is that thing where you go inside and outside on the piece of paper as you follow it?

34:43.740 --> 34:45.723
Because it's self-defining in a way.

34:46.224 --> 34:50.130
Of course, if you don't remember it, of what importance can it be?

34:50.391 --> 34:53.776
But at the same time, I think he meant something else.

34:54.116 --> 34:55.438
I think he meant those things.

34:55.779 --> 34:58.643
The only things that are important are the things that are embedded.

34:59.011 --> 35:25.677
in your heart and in your soul since they happened or you heard them or whatever and it was those things that i was i was looking for things that had really shaped me or that i was afraid would shape me and leaving out a lot of the rest i didn't want to write a book such as everybody else had written only out of this

35:26.180 --> 35:30.567
I would say, perhaps unwise idea of doing original things.

35:31.309 --> 35:35.756
And so that's the way I wrote it.

35:36.878 --> 35:40.965
I mean, I could write another book just like it and tell a lot of things.

35:41.418 --> 35:47.773
that aren't in this, and maybe it would be just as interesting, but I don't believe I'm going to do it once is enough.

35:49.577 --> 35:52.384
The book also only goes up to about 1975, 1980.

35:52.725 --> 35:56.454
I mean, it stops almost 20 years ago.

35:56.474 --> 35:58.178
So there is room

35:59.035 --> 35:59.616
For more?

35:59.916 --> 36:00.938
You mean volume two?

36:02.039 --> 36:06.706
Tell your readers not to be apprehensive.

36:08.188 --> 36:11.553
But this book, I bet it's doing very well commercially.

36:11.573 --> 36:13.376
Do you think it is?

36:13.476 --> 36:17.222
Well, for me, it is.

36:17.582 --> 36:25.814
Do you think that maybe more people will get to know you through your recollections than they might have say through your novels?

36:25.834 --> 36:26.796
Oh, unquestionably.

36:28.037 --> 36:28.418
Yes.

36:28.617 --> 36:29.839
that's going to do that.

36:30.701 --> 36:40.960
Whether it will... I mean, yes, and you sell backless books, that is to say, earlier books, in greater number because of that.

36:41.101 --> 36:42.203
I don't know.

36:42.223 --> 36:43.926
It's not going to be a tidal wave.

36:44.598 --> 36:53.009
This is a time when all these other memoirs are coming out.

36:53.930 --> 36:58.136
This is a nice book.

36:58.216 --> 37:05.425
I don't know if that's good or bad, but you're not going into this confessional stuff either.

37:05.445 --> 37:11.213
It just seems to be the stuff that's working these days.

37:11.632 --> 37:14.897
You know, you write the book, as I said, that you would like to read.

37:17.781 --> 37:21.726
I haven't asked you things that you discuss on the book.

37:21.747 --> 37:23.349
I mean, that's my job to read that.

37:23.469 --> 37:25.332
It seems silly to go over things.

37:25.352 --> 37:26.974
Well, whatever you like.

37:27.074 --> 37:29.758
I have to say that Irwin Shaw was...

37:30.143 --> 37:36.531
I wish he had left half a dozen books that we could have read after he left us.

37:36.651 --> 37:37.011
Oh, really?

37:37.031 --> 37:38.052
You liked him a lot?

37:38.092 --> 37:39.494
Very much, yeah.

37:39.774 --> 37:45.181
Well, I'm somewhat circumspect about the literary aspects of Erwin.

37:45.241 --> 37:48.905
It's really the manly, it's really his character, his persona.

37:48.925 --> 37:51.468
It's very entertaining, though, I would have to say.

37:51.508 --> 37:52.569
He or his writing?

37:52.589 --> 37:53.130
His writing.

37:53.110 --> 37:55.193
I didn't hear it.

37:55.213 --> 38:01.603
Well, of course, his original story, the one that made him famous, I see is still anthologized all the time.

38:02.203 --> 38:05.889
His other books seem to be, I don't know.

38:05.909 --> 38:22.273
At college, when you read the course outlines and you listen to academics, and a lot of reputations are, I would not say forged, but certainly finished off in a way and in half,

38:22.692 --> 38:32.550
by what is being taught, because these students come in, you know, they don't have their roots, cultural roots, don't go very deep.

38:32.570 --> 38:38.140
They haven't all read the same things as they might have 50 years ago.

38:38.181 --> 38:44.953
In fact, they are less well-read than my contemporaries were.

38:45.558 --> 39:10.722
and as you see what the academics are teaching you get an idea of who is who is being endorsed and who's being approved validated is the perfect word which writers are being validated and those validated writers are in a better position to be read later but that's not the final vote of course that

39:11.107 --> 39:14.514
We don't know where that boat is made or how it's made.

39:15.015 --> 39:17.139
Something else happens, but that's part of it.

39:18.302 --> 39:21.087
And Erwin Shaw, I mean, is not one of those.

39:21.208 --> 39:25.837
No, 20 years from now, I don't imagine that many people are going to know who he was.

39:25.857 --> 39:27.360
I am afraid.

39:27.661 --> 39:46.328
that might happen uh well it might uh he was a very good writer and a and an extraordinary uh figure i think and i uh yeah i was very uh i don't want to say he made a man of me but uh

39:46.730 --> 39:51.755
He gave you a lot of ideas of what one could be.

39:53.117 --> 39:54.538
Yeah, I admired him tremendously.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.000
Well, that's evident.

39:56.340 --> 39:57.641
Perhaps it's too evident.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.044
I probably should have modified that.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.167
Well, we talk about canonical stuff, though.

40:03.187 --> 40:05.489
Again, I was talking with Margaret Travel two days ago.

40:05.529 --> 40:15.960
She is, by coincidence, the editor of the Oxford Companion to English Literature, because she's kind of in a position to decide who's in and who's out in a very fine way.

40:15.940 --> 40:19.787
And so I said, well, you know, she's starting in January to do a new one.

40:19.948 --> 40:20.649
Who's in?

40:21.130 --> 40:24.376
She said, well, nobody reads Sir Walter Raleigh anymore.

40:24.396 --> 40:25.338
Nobody, but he's in.

40:25.358 --> 40:27.202
He stays in because he has to be in.

40:27.222 --> 40:31.289
She said, nobody reads The Fairy Queen anymore, but that stays in.

40:32.071 --> 40:33.634
But this is interesting, actually.

40:33.654 --> 40:34.896
Isn't that interesting?

40:34.916 --> 40:37.241
Yeah, this is what I talk about with my wife.

40:37.261 --> 40:38.944
I wouldn't bore anybody at dinner.

40:39.228 --> 40:43.035
But yes, it is tremendously interesting.

40:43.055 --> 40:47.464
There are works, yes, like The Fairy Queen, that have to be in, even though they're unread.

40:47.785 --> 40:49.889
I'm teaching Jane Austen at the moment.

40:50.590 --> 40:55.600
I could write a Jane Austen book, I really could, because it is so simple.

40:55.867 --> 41:05.997
And I could write as good a book, in a way, as she has written, but it wouldn't be any good because it wasn't done by Jane Austen at the time.

41:06.017 --> 41:06.457
That's right.

41:06.717 --> 41:07.518
It has to be.

41:07.818 --> 41:10.521
You know, it made me think, for instance, of Gates.

41:10.741 --> 41:24.034
I don't know what his house is like, but I imagine from reading these vague reports that he can summon upon the walls and these marvelous screens any painting from, you know, hundreds or even thousands.

41:24.318 --> 41:35.937
that he has the rights to, and perhaps with definition that is so beautiful that it's more brilliant perhaps than even the original painting is because it's, you know, reproduced digitally.

41:35.957 --> 41:37.439
I'm writing about this, by the way.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.184
Well, so he can do all this, right?

41:40.484 --> 41:43.028
But at the same time, that's a wonderful illustration.

41:43.128 --> 41:46.714
Graphically, it's going to be overwhelming to see that.

41:46.913 --> 41:49.896
but it's not the painting, and it doesn't have the soul.

41:50.177 --> 42:00.749
I don't like to use that word again, but it doesn't have some quality that the painting has that is inimitable, and you have to have the painting to have that.

42:00.949 --> 42:02.711
Nothing else replaces it.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.834
Well, that's like the Jane Austen book.

42:04.854 --> 42:09.479
I mean, yes, you can write it, but it's not going to do you any good.

42:09.880 --> 42:16.347
Nobody's going to read it, even though it's better than Jane Austen, and it won't be better than her inferior

42:16.512 --> 42:20.384
version of it is, because she didn't write it.

42:20.444 --> 42:27.687
You understand what I... I'm writing about this whole concept of text, and what is it about the actual book?

42:28.038 --> 42:34.124
You know, it is relevant to this whole computer technology where they're scanning things.

42:35.826 --> 42:38.708
It's paradoxical, but it's there.

42:38.869 --> 42:40.350
I mean, you know, it's a question.

42:41.471 --> 42:46.997
The world and life are too... I like Saul Bellow's line, in the end, he has some old man dying.

42:47.357 --> 42:48.678
Or maybe he just said this.

42:49.139 --> 42:53.623
And the father says to his son, one of his final comments is...

42:54.312 --> 42:57.316
I just, when it ends, I want to turn it on the other side.

42:57.336 --> 42:58.197
That's all I am.

42:58.217 --> 43:04.805
We should just do one side, because otherwise you're going to be transcribing this damn thing for months.

43:04.965 --> 43:06.287
Don't worry about it.

43:06.307 --> 43:07.749
That's my problem.

43:07.809 --> 43:08.169
Go ahead.

43:08.189 --> 43:14.337
So Bellows, the guy says to his sonnesty's time, you know, I never figured it out.

43:16.459 --> 43:19.183
And in a sense, life is like that.

43:19.483 --> 43:21.045
The further you go...

43:21.262 --> 43:26.269
the more difficult it is to make everything out.

43:26.509 --> 43:30.876
When you're young, you don't have that problem, of course, because everything is different.

43:31.296 --> 43:33.099
But later on, you begin to have it.

43:33.619 --> 43:36.604
Well, I think it's unworthy of writers.

43:36.664 --> 43:45.917
I'm quoting someone here, maybe Gide, I don't remember, who said it's unworthy of noble natures to spread around them the confusion they feel.

43:45.937 --> 43:50.323
And I think that's especially true as writers mature, because then...

43:50.843 --> 43:57.570
you begin to say, well, I'm losing that single point of view.

43:57.710 --> 44:01.514
I did interview with Stephen Jay Gould, you probably know over at Harvard.

44:01.534 --> 44:10.723
He told me an interesting story that they actually, somebody built a total scale, a perfect reproduction of the spirit of St.

44:10.743 --> 44:11.104
Louis.

44:11.424 --> 44:11.644
Yes.

44:13.306 --> 44:20.293
But nobody, and it looked precisely like Lindbergh's aircraft, but nobody wanted to have their picture taken next to it.

44:20.662 --> 44:23.005
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

44:23.025 --> 44:27.650
It is exactly, because it's not the spirit of St.

44:27.690 --> 44:27.870
Louis.

44:27.930 --> 44:28.451
Exactly.

44:29.072 --> 44:30.794
And I think that's what you're saying.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.135
Yes, yes.

44:32.155 --> 44:35.860
I mean, we understand it, but it's inexplicable.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.523
It's indefinable in a certain way, unprovable.

44:38.943 --> 44:42.267
It's rather like flipping a coin, right?

44:42.287 --> 44:47.293
You know that if you flip a coin and it turns out 18 times heads,

44:47.797 --> 44:57.548
that the odds of the tails are much greater, but at the same time you know that the odds are only 50-50 on the next... Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.

44:58.630 --> 45:06.899
It's hard to hold those ideas in opposition, you know, in your mind at the same time, but they're both true for some reason.

45:06.919 --> 45:09.382
Well, that's like this whole question.

45:09.402 --> 45:12.326
There are a lot of things that are in opposition.

45:12.346 --> 45:13.467
You know what, I think I've...

45:13.801 --> 45:42.627
consumed a lot of your time here what happened we have to go well i think you might have don't you have a signing tonight no i have a dinner what time is your dinner i forget but there's certainly come and find me okay all i have to do is put a tie on but the dinner can't be at six no but it's i just want to alert you to the fact that it's ten minutes to six so a couple more minutes and then you can go i'm i'm i'm enjoying this but i don't want to uh

45:42.877 --> 45:44.499
No, no, I'll be all right.

45:44.519 --> 45:45.641
I'm sure I'll be all right.

45:45.661 --> 45:52.972
But that's, again, going back to travel, I said, I'll ask you this question.

45:53.012 --> 45:56.998
Does literature have to be relevant?

45:57.218 --> 45:59.502
Relevant to what?

45:59.562 --> 46:09.677
Well, you mentioned that, you know, and I use the word validate for a novel, for a work, a writer, to be validated in the academy particularly.

46:10.079 --> 46:14.910
The argument today is from whatever faction you want to name, is the work relevant?

46:14.930 --> 46:15.932
Is Shakespeare relevant?

46:15.952 --> 46:17.295
People actually ask that question.

46:17.315 --> 46:19.300
What a stupid question.

46:19.921 --> 46:20.582
People say it.

46:20.923 --> 46:21.464
Who?

46:21.545 --> 46:22.386
Tell me.

46:22.406 --> 46:24.150
Who says such a thing?

46:24.170 --> 46:26.576
Read Harold Bloom's book on the Western canon.

46:26.616 --> 46:29.843
He, of course, is the great defender of the Western canon.

46:30.160 --> 46:35.087
But Shakespeare, I would think, needs very few defenders, even against these idiots.

46:35.768 --> 46:46.682
Well, you're out at Williams College, Amherst College, just a couple of years ago, graduated a student, summa cum laude, English major, who had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.204
Well, that's possible, of course.

46:48.925 --> 46:56.455
I mean, the fact that you can actually get a degree in English without ever having been required to study Shakespeare.

46:56.556 --> 46:58.378
Oh, I'm not surprised at that.

46:58.612 --> 47:02.258
Well, yes, but I mean, curricula have changed.

47:02.378 --> 47:06.644
I mean, you know, I have kids who had to take a course.

47:06.804 --> 47:09.829
You have to choose from A, B, C, and D, and so forth.

47:10.190 --> 47:14.857
They take a course in tap dancing in Chicago in the 20s or something.

47:14.897 --> 47:16.980
That counts as, you know.

47:17.020 --> 47:21.246
Yeah, I don't think that means anything.

47:22.368 --> 47:25.733
That's just the way schools are conducted now.

47:26.101 --> 47:34.270
Listen, this is a very slow grinding process that I don't think you can get overly excited about at any time.

47:34.330 --> 47:36.753
We don't even know which way it's going, really.

47:36.793 --> 47:38.635
You know, we're like ants on a log.

47:39.776 --> 47:43.360
What specifically is a very slow grinding process?

47:43.380 --> 47:49.788
Oh, this whole question of culture and what is going to endure and which way we're going and how it's being formed.

47:50.268 --> 47:54.673
I mean, yes, of course there are people shouting in the streets everywhere telling you,

47:54.991 --> 47:59.417
what's happening, but I'd be cautious about believing in any one of them.

48:00.739 --> 48:06.447
Do you mind if I use some of these quotes in this new book I'm working on, by the way?

48:06.487 --> 48:08.230
I have a chapter.

48:08.590 --> 48:11.474
Well, if they're worthy, don't use them if they're stupid.

48:13.417 --> 48:23.631
I've been using these interviews as an opportunity to talk about matters that

48:24.252 --> 48:25.954
interesting to me also for this book.

48:25.974 --> 48:39.429
I am interested in this whole concept of texts, you know, because really, what is... I was at the Nobel Library, so I'd have to have this... No, but Farrell thought he should have it, definitely.

48:39.450 --> 48:45.757
He was canvassing his fellow writers to recommend him, and I know Chandler thought he should have it.

48:45.777 --> 48:45.957
Chandler?

48:46.156 --> 48:47.258
Raymond Chandler.

48:47.278 --> 48:49.020
Yeah, but he thought he should have got the Nobel Prize.

48:49.040 --> 48:49.801
Well, he did.

48:49.821 --> 48:50.302
I don't know.

48:50.322 --> 48:51.424
He was very educated.

48:51.444 --> 48:59.816
I like Chandler, but he was kind of very... Well, they get... These fellas get a little... I don't know what to say.

49:00.076 --> 49:07.627
But I don't want to mention names here because the thing is on, but we certainly... I can certainly... A name like this might be interesting.

49:07.727 --> 49:07.827
Okay.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.834
There you go.

49:10.094 --> 49:11.516
This is not a good pen.

49:11.576 --> 49:15.501
It's stakes, but I have one of which I left at home.

49:15.761 --> 49:18.345
Well, I hand-scratched in there.

49:18.665 --> 49:22.230
What's your address so I can send you a copy of this piece?

49:22.991 --> 49:24.412
It's going to be worth nothing.

49:24.793 --> 49:30.880
In this book, I seem to have signed virtually every copy that's been sold of it.

49:30.901 --> 49:32.282
I can't believe that.

49:32.703 --> 49:35.386
What was the first printing of it?

49:35.406 --> 49:36.868
It's about...

49:37.456 --> 49:42.283
25 or 30,000 copies.

49:42.724 --> 49:43.826
For me, you say?

49:44.086 --> 49:45.869
Yeah, for anybody.

49:46.169 --> 49:47.251
That's a nice first printing.

49:47.391 --> 49:48.513
Oh, very big for me.

49:48.934 --> 49:51.317
I mean, I had never had a first printing.

49:51.377 --> 49:55.864
I had never had a total sale of half of that.

49:55.884 --> 49:57.847
So they thought it would do very well.

49:57.947 --> 49:58.448
And it is.

49:59.009 --> 49:59.490
Yes.

49:59.610 --> 50:01.493
That's excellent.

50:01.513 --> 50:04.257
It depends now, I suppose, on what word of mouth is we're

50:04.540 --> 50:08.045
If somebody says to somebody else, I really like this.

50:08.065 --> 50:10.628
Yeah, well, I'll get it in 25 papers.

50:10.869 --> 50:14.193
Where people buy books, which is great.

50:14.454 --> 50:16.397
I mean, Columbus might be a lousy city.

50:17.017 --> 50:19.060
I'm in Toledo, too, by the way.

50:19.901 --> 50:21.203
Toledo's an interesting place.

50:21.283 --> 50:25.489
It's right across the river from where Dreiser wrote Sister Carrie, Ma Me.

50:25.790 --> 50:26.751
Exactly right.

50:26.771 --> 50:27.973
The house is still there.

50:29.555 --> 50:31.097
And then Grand Rapids.

50:31.257 --> 50:32.459
Did I mention Grand Rapids?

50:32.479 --> 50:32.539
No.

50:33.076 --> 50:36.241
And then you have Allentown, PA.

50:37.142 --> 50:39.265
I went to a wedding there, my roommate's wedding.

50:39.525 --> 50:41.949
You mentioned something about Allentown when you were flying for it.

50:41.969 --> 50:44.272
Flying over Allentown.

50:44.353 --> 50:45.835
Anything I can get for an angle.

50:47.657 --> 50:48.278
Exactly.

50:48.739 --> 50:51.924
The book features Allentown.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.928
There's no paper in Great Garrington tonight, I think.

50:54.948 --> 50:55.549
Too bad.

50:56.070 --> 50:57.632
There is one there, actually.

50:57.798 --> 51:18.540
they published a uh something rather recently about it let me say that the flight stuff is the best uh well i love blind stuff that's you must have known that that was wonderful well i did the best i could yeah that's yeah that captures it i think anyone who's ever been

51:19.027 --> 51:45.220
taken by uh that experience do you still fly by the way no i mean not as a pilot well you have to i don't have the time to devote to it you can't just do it like playing around with golf once a month i have a private license which i haven't exercised in 20 years because i was only flying six times four or five times a year and i was too dangerous and i was becoming dangerous yeah very dangerous young children i didn't want to you know make them an orphan no

51:45.200 --> 51:45.901
You've got to.

51:46.001 --> 51:48.145
It has to be something you have the time for.

51:48.365 --> 51:53.774
I have the time, and I do it often, and so I just didn't, but I loved it.

51:53.794 --> 51:56.459
Oh, it's, right.

51:56.719 --> 51:58.623
Enough said.

51:58.643 --> 52:02.790
Well, I remember it very clearly, naturally.

52:02.810 --> 52:04.272
I think we have plenty of stuff, sir.
