WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:13.682
Now, the prep school is not as surprising because we went to the same prep school.

00:14.563 --> 00:16.386
He was happy.

00:16.626 --> 00:20.111
This is not holographic.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.673
No, no, no.

00:21.753 --> 00:31.506
And then he had, if I'm not mistaken, if I'm not mistaken, he had a copy of my senior thesis at Princeton, which is

00:33.022 --> 00:36.926
which I didn't have for a long time.

00:39.768 --> 00:40.649
That's kind of funny, isn't it?

00:41.530 --> 00:46.635
Anyway, your new book, which I think is great.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.417
Congratulations.

00:48.437 --> 00:49.858
Thank you.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.820
And you brought Blodwick back.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.602
Yeah.

00:53.622 --> 00:54.683
How did that come to pass?

00:54.703 --> 00:56.324
You couldn't let him go, could you?

00:56.344 --> 01:02.370
Well, it was because they needed a...

01:04.595 --> 01:10.146
a voice, the investigative voice.

01:10.166 --> 01:18.363
And essentially, and he needed a voice.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.605
I needed a voice.

01:20.387 --> 01:23.413
It was a voice I was familiar with.

01:24.322 --> 01:44.006
As I think I might have told you the last time we talked, I was quite surprised when it turned out that he was the leading character in the red, white, and blue, because I thought, first I thought his brother Breaux would be, and then I thought that Leah, whenever she came on the screen, took over the book.

01:44.667 --> 01:48.873
But of course, he is the survivor, and so he turned out to be here.

01:49.553 --> 01:51.696
In this book, he's basically just a boy.

01:52.334 --> 01:53.615
and trying to find out.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.818
So it was easier.

01:56.058 --> 02:02.345
And I always like to know what happens to people after the book is over.

02:02.365 --> 02:10.834
I was giving a reading a couple of weeks ago, and everyone said to me, whatever happened to Thomas Mullins in intrusion fashion?

02:11.475 --> 02:13.217
And I said, I'm really glad you asked.

02:14.178 --> 02:17.762
And this was in the QA afterwards.

02:17.782 --> 02:19.624
And I read him the portion of this.

02:19.739 --> 02:26.589
book, which had to do with Tom Sawyer seeing how he got involved in this murder case thing we couldn't solve, and then how he died in 1984.

02:27.149 --> 02:30.775
So I'd like to sort of go back to these people.

02:31.095 --> 02:48.700
It is conceivable that the book that I'm working on, I think I'm working on now, that I'm something around it now, that the leading character would be Blue Tyler's daughter, the woman who originally this book was supposed to be about.

02:49.321 --> 02:54.429
and he doesn't make any character to the last page.

02:55.511 --> 03:01.942
And I was feeling that the new book's going to be, I've been sort of fooling around with a voice.

03:04.125 --> 03:04.606
A sequel?

03:04.626 --> 03:05.187
No, no, no.

03:05.207 --> 03:07.791
This will take place live in Washington.

03:08.592 --> 03:12.038
And they have sort of fringes of politics.

03:12.642 --> 03:15.906
in Washington and probably New Mexico.

03:16.146 --> 03:19.110
Now, you said that this started out as a book about her.

03:19.130 --> 03:22.014
Is that right?

03:22.454 --> 03:24.657
Well, a lot of things happened.

03:25.198 --> 03:38.835
I sort of had an idea of doing a book, sort of a contemporary, Sister Carrie, in which Sister Carrie was a kind of

03:39.862 --> 03:42.044
singing off from Ginny Foch.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.026
Do you remember Ginny Foch?

03:44.066 --> 03:47.909
Ginny Foch was the leader of Mao.

03:47.929 --> 03:57.578
Her past wife came up and she murdered a number of years.

03:57.858 --> 04:00.641
And she had this mother who was this kind of baggage mother.

04:00.861 --> 04:07.607
It didn't work for a number of reasons, not the least of which it was too fresh.

04:08.465 --> 04:09.426
in mine.

04:09.466 --> 04:30.328
I mean, it was just, so you were, so you were, you would essentially be doing a Ramona Clay, and it was, it was, it was, many people would notice it, which, which is no fun, you know, you know, to do, I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't know how you can keep yourself awake doing a book about the Kennedys, say, a book about Donald Trump.

04:30.348 --> 04:36.615
I mean, I just don't know, everyone knows it, and it's a,

04:37.270 --> 04:39.152
Like a little distance from it.

04:39.172 --> 04:40.013
So that didn't work.

04:41.014 --> 04:49.441
And then we had a long, long, long, long time that we had an idea about doing something.

04:52.304 --> 05:00.712
About a Jewish gangster who goes to Hollywood, obviously inspired by Dougie Spiegel, and who fell in love with Shirley Temple.

05:00.732 --> 05:07.058
But not Shirley Temple, Qua Shirley Temple.

05:07.983 --> 05:13.151
That was just like a two-line idea that I had somewhere.

05:13.411 --> 05:23.527
And then John and I got asked to do a movie about those things.

05:24.568 --> 05:25.430
And we turned it down.

05:26.672 --> 05:31.779
I said to him, what about a kind of generic Jewish gangster?

05:32.481 --> 05:36.707
He gave him an idea of the generic Jewish gangster.

05:37.278 --> 05:43.087
And so Lee started working screen playing, which fell between the cracks.

05:43.187 --> 05:44.189
The studio was sold.

05:44.249 --> 05:46.853
It was like, you know, Johnny Evans leaving Europe.

05:46.873 --> 05:47.434
Sure.

05:47.554 --> 05:49.878
And you're out there in the Gulf.

05:50.018 --> 05:52.922
And so it just, yeah, it was for Lorimar.

05:53.183 --> 05:57.029
And then Lorimar was bought by one or by the family.

05:57.049 --> 06:00.334
It was in someplace colder than Siberia.

06:00.434 --> 06:01.596
So I put it aside.

06:02.617 --> 06:04.080
Went back to work in the book.

06:04.921 --> 06:05.682
And...

06:07.872 --> 06:33.095
Then medicine intervened, and then I thought, well, you know, medicine, I was, and then I'd run back, before medicine intervened, I'd have this, have the bag lady be this chili pimple 45 years later.

06:33.135 --> 06:35.096
Now, how did she get to this point?

06:35.276 --> 06:37.018
That's what I couldn't figure out.

06:37.825 --> 06:49.720
And then I had opened, I was racing through the Honolulu airport the day after Christmas, 1990, and I went boom.

06:51.182 --> 06:52.984
It went out for a couple of seconds.

06:53.004 --> 06:54.026
Scary though.

06:54.947 --> 06:55.167
Yes, scary.

06:55.227 --> 06:57.350
John said to me when I was active, I said, no.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.172
It happened to me once before.

06:59.292 --> 07:00.234
I said, I'll be okay.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.335
I'll just keep.

07:02.075 --> 07:06.660
When I got back to New York, I went to my doctor and had a very serious test.

07:06.780 --> 07:10.204
Obviously, at some point, I was going to have to have an open-heart surgery.

07:11.286 --> 07:17.272
And so I got a second opinion on a Saturday at the London Hospital.

07:17.292 --> 07:27.424
And the second opinion doctor said to me, after doing this, he does his own workout.

07:27.444 --> 07:30.968
He said to me, you have two options.

07:31.741 --> 07:32.963
If you have this operation, you know what?

07:32.983 --> 07:33.504
You die.

07:35.827 --> 07:37.710
Tends to concentrate the mind wonderfully.

07:38.912 --> 07:42.317
And so I was operated on a couple of weeks later.

07:44.601 --> 07:47.205
And... You never had a heart attack?

07:47.225 --> 07:47.485
No.

07:48.347 --> 07:48.627
No.

07:48.928 --> 07:49.489
No.

07:49.509 --> 07:50.610
And I had a heart attack.

07:50.630 --> 07:54.536
It was just... I had... It was a genetic thing.

07:54.777 --> 07:57.361
My aortic valve had basically closed.

07:57.381 --> 07:59.444
I wasn't getting what caused the paining.

07:59.865 --> 08:00.145
I wouldn't.

08:00.530 --> 08:06.880
The blood budget was down, as they say.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.602
And so I was getting it down.

08:08.683 --> 08:12.268
Now, getting over that, I think about eight years, whatever.

08:12.288 --> 08:21.602
I love the stuff that I read in the paper that Michael Eisner, after he had his triple bypass, was a big painting memo the next day.

08:22.924 --> 08:23.806
Bullshit.

08:23.826 --> 08:24.006
Bullshit.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.442
It was bullshit.

08:26.522 --> 08:27.243
Give me a break.

08:27.263 --> 08:32.389
I had a ventral hernia thing last day, which is no big deal.

08:32.469 --> 08:41.819
But I was in the hospital someplace and I didn't feel like doing anything.

08:41.839 --> 08:43.701
It takes about eight weeks to get over.

08:44.322 --> 08:50.408
And then I was just getting back to work and I got blood poisoning.

08:50.428 --> 08:51.850
I got bitten by a bug.

08:52.218 --> 08:53.180
Mosquito, I reckon.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.422
Mosquito, yeah.

08:54.442 --> 08:55.844
I got a bit on the ankle.

08:56.325 --> 09:04.799
And either the mosquito was carrying bacteria, or there was bacteria in my skin where the puncture was, or when I scratched it, there was bacteria in my finger.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.526
And my left leg went up, boom, like this.

09:08.546 --> 09:10.068
It was Saturday.

09:10.088 --> 09:10.329
Saturday.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.272
What was the mosquito carrying?

09:12.673 --> 09:15.077
Some bacteria.

09:15.117 --> 09:16.139
From the gut from what?

09:16.840 --> 09:17.601
Oh, from the gut.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.689
It could have been nesting and shit.

09:19.709 --> 09:23.693
You know, it could have been nesting and nesting and nesting and stuff.

09:23.713 --> 09:33.502
This was on an off Broadway theater, and I thought my doctor would be on Nantucket, where he goes every summer, around the weekend.

09:33.923 --> 09:35.224
I called him.

09:35.624 --> 09:38.867
It turned out he was the cover doctor for his group that weekend.

09:38.987 --> 09:40.669
He was in town.

09:40.689 --> 09:43.592
I told him what happened, and he came right over.

09:43.612 --> 09:46.795
He took one look at my leg for this.

09:47.517 --> 09:52.463
because I had the plastic bag.

09:53.243 --> 09:55.086
Infection is a really big word.

09:57.308 --> 09:59.831
And so I was in the hospital, that time, 10 days.

10:01.853 --> 10:08.060
And I was basically just taking this industrial chain of antibiotics.

10:08.881 --> 10:13.746
And as he said to me, I was at a lot more risk for this than I ever was for the heart surgery.

10:13.766 --> 10:15.128
Because he said, we forget.

10:16.745 --> 10:19.948
In our parents' generation, my doctor is Tim Wells.

10:20.048 --> 10:21.049
He's Bill Wells' brother.

10:21.390 --> 10:21.790
Okay.

10:22.791 --> 10:23.372
Yeah.

10:23.552 --> 10:24.553
Francis Wells.

10:24.573 --> 10:25.594
His name is, his nickname, Tim.

10:26.275 --> 10:35.504
And Tim said to me, we forget, in our parents' generation, people die of infection.

10:35.564 --> 10:36.325
They die of fever.

10:36.445 --> 10:38.387
Women die of puerperal fever after childbirth.

10:38.987 --> 10:44.473
And he said, and I thought that puerperal fever was...

10:45.618 --> 10:46.920
was a part of the birth.

10:46.940 --> 10:52.666
He said, no, it's an infection that sets into the womb after giving birth.

10:53.167 --> 10:56.871
And that's what killed women in childbirth.

10:56.911 --> 10:59.274
Not the pain of the childbirth, it was the infection.

11:00.395 --> 11:06.622
My grandmother died in childbirth.

11:06.642 --> 11:14.832
Yeah, and it was, it was, well, I was,

11:15.841 --> 11:21.488
is a Byzantine way of saying that for about eight months I didn't work.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.593
Eight months in which I didn't think about the book.

11:25.613 --> 11:31.620
Eight months in which when I came back, I came back to absolutely fresh.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.302
I wasn't batting my head against it.

11:33.322 --> 11:34.624
How much had been done at that point?

11:34.644 --> 11:35.725
It wasn't still a card set.

11:35.965 --> 11:36.706
Too many pages.

11:36.726 --> 11:37.427
That's a lot.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.129
200 pages, and I never could get beyond that.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.372
The 200 that are here?

11:43.412 --> 11:43.612
Yeah.

11:44.393 --> 11:49.100
Because this could go anywhere after the first 90 pages.

11:49.340 --> 11:53.225
Basically, it's the 200 that are there, slightly rearranged.

11:53.285 --> 11:57.571
I mean, until that guy, the cat, that's what would go anywhere.

11:59.073 --> 12:05.661
And it was up to the shopping expedition and the shopping mall, and I never knew where.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.684
I couldn't figure out where to go.

12:08.423 --> 12:17.177
And with a slight rearrangement, it was because I hadn't thought about it.

12:17.197 --> 12:18.178
It was preoccupied.

12:18.439 --> 12:24.127
Yeah, but I hadn't thought about it, which is really good, because sometimes you've got to step away from something else to figure out.

12:24.147 --> 12:33.342
And it took me two years to do the first 200 pages, and it took me seven months to do the last 500 pages of manuscript.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.545
Because once I did a slight rearrangement,

12:36.942 --> 12:57.085
There's a chapter, right, the first chapter after the shopping expedition begins something like, in the fullness of time, I've tried to contemplate why certain banks have become legends and others become only legends, fictions.

12:57.405 --> 13:00.329
That was way up in the front of the book.

13:00.349 --> 13:04.133
Did you always intend to really write about the film colony?

13:04.534 --> 13:05.835
Not...

13:06.018 --> 13:13.371
Not really, yes, but to what degree... Yeah, but to what degree, I didn't know.

13:14.372 --> 13:25.672
And so, as I said, the last 500 pages, that was cute, and it was bliss.

13:26.654 --> 13:29.238
I mean, the first two years were just crazy.

13:29.318 --> 13:31.502
I was so depressed, as you always are.

13:31.904 --> 13:35.689
Once I figured out how to do it, I was walking in the park one morning.

13:35.829 --> 13:38.452
I walked in Central Park every morning for three miles.

13:39.553 --> 13:44.480
And I came home and I said to Joan, I know how to finish three books.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.164
And first of all, I just took this thing out and put it there.

13:48.925 --> 13:53.531
And when I sat down and did it, and it was... Does Joan read your stuff?

13:53.911 --> 13:54.152
Always.

13:54.232 --> 13:55.233
Always.

13:55.914 --> 13:58.417
Always, as I read her stuff.

13:58.918 --> 14:00.139
She just showed me...

14:01.199 --> 14:08.447
And before I left, she showed me the first 60 pages of her novel.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.950
And she said, I don't know where it's going.

14:11.330 --> 14:14.814
And I said, have you ever known where a book is going?

14:14.914 --> 14:16.576
Have I ever known where a book is going?

14:16.596 --> 14:18.939
You just go where it thinks you're going.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.880
She was pissing and moaning.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.742
I thought it was terrific.

14:22.843 --> 14:29.991
And it takes place in 1984, in the 80s, 84, you know, early 84.

14:30.578 --> 14:37.527
And so she wrote another 12 pages.

14:37.547 --> 14:42.754
She wrote it to me the night before I left, and I read every 12 pages.

14:42.894 --> 14:46.099
I said, this is your idea of not knowing where to go.

14:46.199 --> 14:49.363
Just keep doing it.

14:49.383 --> 14:49.643
That's great.

14:49.664 --> 14:53.068
You've written how many books now?

14:53.909 --> 14:58.095
I saw a number of books.

14:58.115 --> 15:00.518
Ten or eleven.

15:00.886 --> 15:07.796
I can even say 12, because I wrote a novel, which is my first book, which has been cannibalized.

15:08.377 --> 15:09.819
There's nothing left now.

15:09.839 --> 15:11.221
There's nothing left about it.

15:11.261 --> 15:11.822
Yeah.

15:12.002 --> 15:13.003
I've used bits and pieces.

15:13.023 --> 15:13.824
I've used it in movies.

15:13.904 --> 15:17.429
I've used it in journalism.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.512
I've used it in other books.

15:19.613 --> 15:20.314
There's nothing left.

15:20.594 --> 15:23.458
It's just dust.

15:23.478 --> 15:27.223
Any problem going from nonfiction?

15:27.243 --> 15:29.066
No, I like doing it.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.488
I did it.

15:31.025 --> 15:37.475
Screenplays, I suppose, I like doing the least, but it pays them up.

15:37.915 --> 15:40.038
So it pays everything else.

15:40.058 --> 15:40.940
I did a piece on A.J.

15:40.960 --> 15:51.936
Simpson this summer for the other group, which ran not on the issue that's on the stand now, but the preceding issue, which I...

15:52.220 --> 15:56.405
There's a big journalism piece I've done in a long time, which I really enjoy doing.

15:56.425 --> 15:56.846
Oh, forget it.

15:57.066 --> 15:58.248
I'm fascinated by this case.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.170
Well, I wanted to step back.

16:00.430 --> 16:04.135
Everyone's doing all this shit.

16:04.235 --> 16:05.917
Did this happen?

16:05.937 --> 16:06.518
Did that happen?

16:06.598 --> 16:18.193
Essentially, what I wanted to do was the unexamined illustration of rhetoric, in which there's too much heroes, tragedy.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.393
He isn't a hero.

16:21.054 --> 16:22.836
It's not really tragic.

16:24.158 --> 16:43.979
But I want to do something about jock culture, which I get into a long thing about what must it be like to live a life in which you're never going to do anything again in your life, as well as what you can do at age 25, in which you're professionally somehow certain.

16:43.999 --> 16:45.241
So I had a lot of fun doing it.

16:45.361 --> 16:46.442
I really didn't get it.

16:47.030 --> 16:48.772
Did you see the stuff today?

16:48.792 --> 16:52.695
Now they're saying they found socks in his room.

16:52.715 --> 16:53.456
They put blood on it.

16:54.997 --> 16:55.378
No, it is.

16:55.618 --> 17:01.403
This morning on the news.

17:02.224 --> 17:02.605
Yes.

17:02.685 --> 17:03.926
I don't think he will beat it.

17:04.346 --> 17:08.930
I don't, but I don't think he'll get rid of one either.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.172
It's going to be a tough one.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.495
I did an interview with Donald Wesley a couple weeks ago.

17:13.675 --> 17:14.215
Funny guy.

17:14.536 --> 17:15.957
Yes, he is funny.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.741
in this particular novel.

17:20.103 --> 17:22.066
I don't know.

17:23.087 --> 17:25.351
I didn't want to get involved in guilt or anything.

17:26.293 --> 17:38.552
I do believe that while we all maintain that we believe

17:39.308 --> 17:56.375
It doesn't really apply to Menendez's brothers or the cops that beat Rodney King or to O.J.

17:56.996 --> 18:01.623
and Ron Paul James Simpson, as I follow along the way through this piece.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.708
And it is...

18:05.212 --> 18:09.598
I'm not saying this DA's office and why they had lost so many cases.

18:09.698 --> 18:16.988
I don't want to say win or lose because of how they failed in those convictions and cases that they should have.

18:18.349 --> 18:31.607
One of the reasons, which I don't get into, is that in the last 12 years, in the Duke-Mage and the people's negotiations,

18:32.178 --> 18:40.671
they have made almost 1,300 judges, and 100 of them come out of the LABA zone.

18:40.711 --> 18:52.650
So you take, that's a lot of people, that's a lot of senior people, Laskita, who was the judge in such a case, who was a cyber prosecutor.

18:53.151 --> 19:00.042
Kathleen Kennedy Powell, who did the, who, she's a former,

19:00.477 --> 19:01.318
L-A-D-A.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.803
So you take senior people out.

19:05.965 --> 19:09.210
He's in such a huge office.

19:09.230 --> 19:11.012
I think they've got 900 lawyers.

19:12.274 --> 19:14.497
Well, yesterday was bizarre.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.180
CNN, I mean.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.782
I couldn't believe it.

19:17.842 --> 19:19.685
I said, what's his press conference about?

19:19.725 --> 19:20.466
Michael Jackson.

19:20.486 --> 19:26.535
I mean, two of the lead stories on the national news are both with T.J.

19:26.555 --> 19:27.857
You know?

19:27.937 --> 19:28.898
Amazing.

19:29.215 --> 19:35.321
I love the fact that you still must collect arcania from every possible place.

19:35.682 --> 19:35.982
I do.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.364
And you use it.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.205
I use it.

19:39.926 --> 19:44.211
You know, I was this morning before you called.

19:44.231 --> 19:46.653
I was going to try and put my stuff together.

19:48.395 --> 19:55.182
And I have a thing of clips from the various newspapers that I picked up along the way.

19:55.222 --> 19:56.303
I was looking very clear.

19:56.654 --> 20:18.218
The Atlanta Constitution, or the morning paper, whatever it was called, has, every day, they have a notebook on the Simpson case, which goes down the left, the two columns on the left-hand side of the even-numbered page.

20:18.339 --> 20:20.601
Two columns?

20:20.701 --> 20:22.343
Two columns.

20:22.623 --> 20:23.865
That's huge.

20:23.885 --> 20:25.767
And it goes right down, right down.

20:26.152 --> 20:28.856
It's like Columbine phone, too.

20:28.876 --> 20:32.502
And it's called Simpson Notebook.

20:32.562 --> 20:33.423
Something like that.

20:33.964 --> 20:35.046
And I picked that stuff.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.328
I picked that stuff in Chicago.

20:36.388 --> 20:38.912
I picked that stuff in Miami.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.936
I just take it out a little while.

20:42.657 --> 20:48.186
I've got maybe a half dozen clips just for different things or on Simpson?

20:48.266 --> 20:49.408
No, different things.

20:49.568 --> 20:50.910
How do you file this?

20:51.548 --> 20:53.330
Under categories?

20:53.350 --> 20:57.775
No, a lot of them I'll put it on a computer.

20:58.035 --> 21:12.230
I'll put them, I'll just say, with a clip file, I'll say, Miami Herald, September, whatever, something, something, something, something.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.892
A guy who killed a hundred dogs in one night.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.534
Just, you know.

21:16.554 --> 21:18.096
Well, the thing about the cotton,

21:18.734 --> 21:21.117
on the electric chair.

21:21.137 --> 21:33.616
I actually knew, I actually had known that before, but that was in something, yeah, you know.

21:33.636 --> 21:48.437
The thing on this production is that the oral sexual act, where he's using a certain kind of, where the hell is he picking that thing?

21:48.417 --> 21:54.265
I mean, you use it in your fiction, and it's not gratuitous.

21:54.345 --> 21:59.291
It does seem to be something to characterize it.

21:59.311 --> 22:05.179
I use it, and also a lot of the stuff is not gathered for this book.

22:05.459 --> 22:12.568
It's just stuff I've had, and it's in the notes for a previous book, and I go through all my notes.

22:13.004 --> 22:21.493
every thought, and sort of cull what I haven't used, and just sort of aside for the next time out of the box.

22:23.755 --> 22:41.593
And I did, you know, for example, the name Melbourne Made, Tulati, was a piece in a Fresno or Sacramento newspaper about lifers in the California prison system, and there's this guy called

22:41.843 --> 23:06.265
melvin i think it was melvin melvin tulati spelled too late and he got absolutely batshit when the reporter called him too late and it was i said i thought it's such an unusual name i have no idea what the ethnic derivation is yeah i have no i have no idea what

23:07.713 --> 23:08.894
I don't know.

23:08.934 --> 23:13.320
What would Tulate or Tulate be?

23:13.620 --> 23:21.990
If it's Tulate, you could say conceivably Indian.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.212
But I have no idea.

23:23.572 --> 23:24.173
No idea.

23:24.193 --> 23:28.438
I remember going back in the 50s, the great Giants football team was a great

23:28.705 --> 23:32.370
His name was Eric Barnes, and he was called Erich.

23:32.430 --> 23:33.332
Erich Barnes, yes.

23:33.492 --> 23:38.599
Erich, what the hell is that name?

23:38.619 --> 23:41.984
Erich Barnes, I remember one thing about my memory.

23:42.505 --> 23:48.714
Somebody was doing an on-site kick, trying to get the ball back against it.

23:48.914 --> 23:54.402
And, of course, they had all the ball hammers up close.

23:54.422 --> 23:58.408
And it came to Erich Barnes, and he was right through the sixth entry for a touchdown.

23:58.878 --> 24:05.127
I got a guy in that book, Charles Blockson, did you ever hear of him?

24:05.147 --> 24:07.790
He was a wonderful football player.

24:07.811 --> 24:16.443
Pardon me, he was Lenny Moore's roommate at Penn State, and he was offered an ironclad, you know, he just walked on again.

24:16.463 --> 24:21.870
I hope you don't mind, but I don't know why I like that.

24:21.890 --> 24:26.397
Is it a love cake kind of a thing you do in the movies?

24:26.417 --> 24:28.159
No, it's, no, no.

24:28.358 --> 24:35.204
He's essentially supported us for 25 years.

24:35.885 --> 24:39.048
I like doing it.

24:39.068 --> 24:42.991
I think we have a certain facility in it.

24:43.011 --> 24:50.038
In terms of the novel, too, I mean, you are certainly... Could it be called a satire or something?

24:50.058 --> 24:52.119
No, I don't think it's called a satire.

24:52.139 --> 24:58.365
It's around a sort of unblinking eye.

24:58.801 --> 25:05.569
And it's, you know, the interesting thing about Hollywood is that nobody understands.

25:06.671 --> 25:13.739
People out there don't really care what anyone says who has worked there.

25:13.759 --> 25:21.128
They figure that they proceed from certain knowledge and who has been a member of the community, as it were.

25:22.249 --> 25:26.074
What drives them crazy is an outsider comes down.

25:26.965 --> 25:29.988
Um, say Bob Woodley.

25:33.272 --> 25:37.316
They get the nuance wrong.

25:37.556 --> 25:39.999
They might get the facts right, but they get the nuance wrong.

25:40.319 --> 25:41.740
They get the subtext.

25:41.921 --> 25:43.863
They don't get the subtext.

25:44.824 --> 25:53.513
And so, John and I over the years have written some very harsh things about Hollywood.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.875
Nobody has ever complained.

25:56.243 --> 26:03.091
Because we have a sense of the nuance, the kind of social weave.

26:05.714 --> 26:16.126
There's a point very, very early in this book where talking about Chucky, after Chucky O'Hara, had named names and came back.

26:17.527 --> 26:25.356
And a lot of the social historians said that he was, you know, absent character, absent character.

26:26.568 --> 26:30.633
And Jack asked him why he did it.

26:31.474 --> 26:34.318
He didn't want it to work.

26:34.638 --> 26:37.382
It is the work that is possible in everything.

26:37.783 --> 26:44.852
And when I said something, I said that Hollywood really does not banish you for moral transgression.

26:44.872 --> 26:48.376
If you understand that, it does not say it's right or it's wrong.

26:48.576 --> 26:52.862
It is just a fact of the... I'm sure Roman Polanski came back.

26:53.078 --> 26:53.779
Oh, sure.

26:53.819 --> 26:54.840
Absolutely.

26:54.940 --> 26:55.881
No problem.

26:55.901 --> 26:59.605
Except if the judge, except the... And assuming everything could be resolved.

26:59.625 --> 27:00.606
Yeah.

27:00.766 --> 27:08.434
I saw on the paper recently where the woman was now 31 or 32 years old.

27:09.716 --> 27:13.400
I think it's crazy for him to be kept away.

27:15.622 --> 27:21.128
Interesting story.

27:21.293 --> 27:23.336
Pardon me for not asking me that much about the novel.

27:23.356 --> 27:26.641
The novel speaks for itself.

27:26.881 --> 27:34.572
You mentioned when Chuckie takes off his leg.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.376
Is that based on something?

27:37.616 --> 27:38.037
No.

27:39.298 --> 27:42.223
We've all seen those news.

27:42.243 --> 27:48.972
I just wanted to do something that would be

27:51.162 --> 27:56.187
I always had Chuckie as a war hero.

27:56.207 --> 27:57.648
Chuckie's my favorite character in the book.

27:57.668 --> 27:58.028
Really?

27:58.048 --> 27:58.549
Yes.

27:58.569 --> 28:00.190
He's my favorite character.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.653
He's the one I wanted.

28:03.033 --> 28:09.139
I wanted him to be a director, a breed I generally do not like.

28:09.459 --> 28:11.701
I wanted him to be a reactionary.

28:12.422 --> 28:15.384
I wanted him to be a Semite.

28:15.604 --> 28:19.448
I wanted him obviously gay.

28:19.917 --> 28:25.763
I wanted him to become a communist because he had some boyfriend who was in the party.

28:26.805 --> 28:27.906
I wanted him a war hero.

28:28.226 --> 28:31.510
I wanted him to rock his back.

28:31.530 --> 28:35.094
I wanted him to be blacklisted.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.715
I wanted him to name names.

28:37.336 --> 28:38.517
I just kept on building this.

28:38.638 --> 28:40.279
I'm not all at once.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.402
Which makes him a real person.

28:42.602 --> 28:43.863
It makes him anyway.

28:43.903 --> 28:47.207
And I wanted you to like him.

28:48.014 --> 28:58.008
And I just thought, God, it'd be great if he, if, if when he pacifies, he takes office.

28:58.188 --> 29:06.500
Well, he does this thing, and he knows nobody's listening to him, because they're just, they're just looking at this, they're just looking at this, at this, at this stump there.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.024
And I thought it'd be, you know, it'd be.

29:09.044 --> 29:10.646
I interviewed John Silber.

29:10.847 --> 29:11.908
Yeah, yeah.

29:11.928 --> 29:13.651
Okay, back on.

29:13.671 --> 29:16.114
Yeah, well, it has the, and I,

29:16.870 --> 29:28.524
And then the thing, I spoke that my favorite passage in the book is where Jackie is talking about his friendship with Jacob King.

29:28.544 --> 29:37.395
And he realizes that it's because of his, because he has lost his life.

29:37.415 --> 29:42.901
And I don't know where, it's fairly well on into the book.

29:43.001 --> 29:46.185
It's one of the, it's the last passage I always read.

29:46.958 --> 29:51.723
when I do a reading.

29:53.444 --> 29:59.410
He realizes that Jacob, all these people, and he is still, he wants to know what it is like to die.

29:59.950 --> 30:04.495
And he assumes that's going to happen to him sometimes.

30:05.035 --> 30:12.983
And he wants to make sure that he behaves as well as those gay movies make.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.813
You know what I like about many things?

30:15.833 --> 30:19.678
First, you don't lose your sense of humor with all the magical stuff that you've been through.

30:19.938 --> 30:20.318
It's funny.

30:20.959 --> 30:23.162
It's a funny book.

30:23.182 --> 30:23.362
Oh, yeah.

30:23.382 --> 30:24.463
I hope it's funny.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.286
You laugh at that.

30:26.306 --> 30:32.072
And number two, you don't seem to be intimidated by concepts of political exactitude.

30:32.173 --> 30:32.233
No.

30:32.253 --> 30:34.115
And that's such a work.

30:34.135 --> 30:36.017
Yeah.

30:36.037 --> 30:40.643
You know, even taking on Emily Dickinson, I mean, you can't.

30:40.663 --> 30:40.883
You can't.

30:40.903 --> 30:41.524
You can't.

30:41.544 --> 30:42.565
You're in serious trouble.

30:42.713 --> 30:43.654
She's an icon.

30:45.157 --> 30:46.659
But it's true.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.441
How the black guy gets whacked.

30:49.663 --> 30:52.227
That's a funny story.

30:52.387 --> 30:54.951
Except for the fact.

30:55.071 --> 30:57.274
Except for the fact.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.860
That story actually happened.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.702
Except for the fact of whacking me.

31:03.063 --> 31:08.310
I had bought $331 worth of sheets.

31:09.092 --> 31:10.414
No.

31:11.455 --> 31:12.096
No.

31:12.532 --> 31:15.176
No, of course not.

31:15.236 --> 31:17.859
$351 with the sheets at Berger.

31:17.899 --> 31:20.062
This was right after we moved into it.

31:20.723 --> 31:24.809
We bought a small apartment in New York in 1984.

31:24.829 --> 31:28.955
And then we moved back to New York in 1988.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.398
And don't keep any place long in California.

31:31.418 --> 31:36.205
But when we bought the small apartment, it was two blocks from Berger.

31:36.225 --> 31:36.746
I went there.

31:36.846 --> 31:37.527
I bought the sheets.

31:38.528 --> 31:39.990
I was walking up 58th Street.

31:40.342 --> 31:50.417
And I saw this woman walking down, and she's like all the women I've been running into in hotels across America, who come to these business conferences.

31:50.497 --> 31:52.600
And she was wearing a suit and all the things.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.683
And then she had a little bit of a look.

31:54.703 --> 31:57.848
And I saw this guy with dreadlocks.

31:57.868 --> 32:00.132
She was about a quarter of the way down 58th Street.

32:00.532 --> 32:03.417
And I saw this guy with dreadlocks at the top of the street.

32:03.437 --> 32:05.440
And I knew he was going for her bag.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.783
I just knew it.

32:08.692 --> 32:12.937
And he went past her and boom, that bag was on her shoulder.

32:13.297 --> 32:14.779
And he went flying back now.

32:16.601 --> 32:20.425
I was smart enough not to take the sheet.

32:20.445 --> 32:25.391
But the other thing was $300 worth of sheets is heavy.

32:25.791 --> 32:26.071
It is.

32:27.373 --> 32:28.454
You know, sheets are heavy.

32:28.614 --> 32:33.940
They are really heavy.

32:34.139 --> 32:37.523
And that's—that's—so I just added that little touch on it.

32:37.543 --> 32:39.766
Well, it gets them in trouble with the crops, which is important.

32:39.806 --> 32:40.848
Yeah, yeah.

32:40.968 --> 32:41.528
Yeah, true.

32:41.548 --> 32:42.389
Yeah.

32:42.409 --> 32:43.110
Yeah.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.712
And which is going to happen today, too.

32:44.732 --> 32:56.487
I mean, if you take a—if you intervene in a situation, you're going to—you're going to—essentially, I wanted to do—to do bonfire and vanities in five pages.

32:58.270 --> 33:00.973
That's pretty wild.

33:01.747 --> 33:02.448
What do I thought?

33:02.588 --> 33:06.072
And it's amazing how you pick up on the obits.

33:06.092 --> 33:08.916
I've been reading them now, the AIDS obits.

33:09.176 --> 33:10.618
Immediately you go to Cusco.

33:10.638 --> 33:13.482
When I see how old a person is, immediately go to Cusco.

33:13.502 --> 33:17.086
Immediately go, and the Times insists on giving it.

33:17.106 --> 33:20.050
And then the longtime companion and stuff.

33:20.070 --> 33:24.936
I haven't seen Lover creeping yet, but have you?

33:25.517 --> 33:29.121
Yes, I have seen Lover, not in the New York papers.

33:29.540 --> 33:33.246
But you, the mate, you see, companion.

33:33.266 --> 33:37.312
Companion, that's what you say.

33:37.352 --> 33:39.436
And then the wife, yeah.

33:39.816 --> 33:50.553
Then you think, when it says, when they say, his mother says, you know the mother's never going to say, his mother's going to say pneumonia.

33:50.874 --> 33:50.974
Yeah.

33:51.106 --> 33:53.850
They insist on the cause of death.

33:53.970 --> 33:58.015
I mean, the times really... Yeah, they want to know.

33:58.276 --> 33:59.818
They put it right up there.

34:00.439 --> 34:13.857
And generally, if you look at the age and they're in love and any kind of... A friend of mine... A friend of ours died of AIDS a few years ago.

34:14.378 --> 34:19.645
And his daughter was...

34:21.177 --> 34:28.668
Their mother was dead, already dead, and his daughters wanted to put in that she died of pain.

34:29.309 --> 34:37.722
But his mother was still alive, and the mother was 80-odd years old, living in Missouri someplace, and she didn't want to do it.

34:38.143 --> 34:45.514
And so they bowed to the mother's wishes.

34:46.169 --> 34:49.373
who they knew, they were aware of his father.

34:50.034 --> 34:51.336
Tragic enough to die.

34:51.436 --> 34:53.359
I don't think they're stigmas.

34:53.419 --> 35:08.239
You know, our friend Tony Richardson died, and he was, you know, and the kids, Natasha and Joey and Catherine, it was never an issue.

35:08.259 --> 35:11.603
They were not going to say.

35:11.768 --> 35:14.973
You have a project say, it's all grist for the mill.

35:15.153 --> 35:16.034
That's on page 23.

35:16.054 --> 35:21.382
And I have a subject that goes back to our, we were talking earlier, everything is grist for the mill.

35:21.402 --> 35:21.783
Everything, yeah.

35:21.923 --> 35:23.586
Everything, everything is.

35:23.606 --> 35:25.689
Everything is grist for the mill.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.396
You never know how it's going to be grist for the mill.

35:30.436 --> 35:31.497
Is the writer always writing?

35:31.578 --> 35:33.921
I mean, are you looking?

35:34.181 --> 35:39.610
Well, somebody asked you, how many hours a day do you look?

35:39.630 --> 35:40.471
I'd say 24.

35:40.511 --> 35:40.611
Sure.

35:41.570 --> 35:45.514
because you're always picking up stuff.

35:45.534 --> 35:56.427
I was on David Budnoy's show last night, and he said, well, he said, we were talking about the difference between New York and Los Angeles.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.249
We moved back to New York.

35:58.269 --> 36:00.992
It is a question that I have to hear.

36:01.232 --> 36:01.332
Yeah.

36:01.533 --> 36:05.898
We moved back from Los Angeles in 1988.

36:06.158 --> 36:09.081
And he was talking about the car and the car.

36:09.482 --> 36:09.822
I said,

36:10.122 --> 36:12.265
You forget one thing about the car.

36:12.706 --> 36:14.709
In composure, you do everything in the car.

36:16.331 --> 36:17.052
I would go on.

36:17.253 --> 36:22.360
I would go on and do an errand for 10 minutes.

36:22.841 --> 36:27.648
I'd get my watch fixed, get my shoes done, or bring the laundry to the laundry.

36:29.311 --> 36:31.534
I always brought the laundry to the laundry.

36:31.614 --> 36:33.918
We never had it picked up.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.181
You're in the car.

36:36.301 --> 36:37.002
You're alone.

36:37.303 --> 36:39.606
You get the radio going.

36:40.244 --> 36:46.385
and you're in this kind of cocoon, and it orders your thoughts.

36:46.405 --> 36:52.465
In New York, you go and bring your shoes to get fixed, you're bumping into people in New York.

36:52.917 --> 36:55.982
But you can do it as a pedestrian in New York.

36:56.143 --> 37:02.494
New York is really one of the most great American cities where people really do live in the life of New York.

37:02.574 --> 37:09.867
Yeah, but there's always aggravation of, get out of the way, you know, or some rollerblader comes in.

37:10.809 --> 37:12.512
I like that a lot.

37:12.745 --> 37:17.732
Rollerbladers drive me absolutely crazy.

37:17.752 --> 37:23.480
I'd like to know why they don't license them, why they don't license cans of spray paint.

37:25.063 --> 37:29.369
Why not license cans of spray paint?

37:31.211 --> 37:35.277
And why rollerbladers and bicyclists don't have to follow traffic.

37:35.864 --> 37:38.387
Why they can go through red lights.

37:38.928 --> 37:40.189
Yeah, it just is.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.332
You block the box in New York.

37:42.452 --> 37:44.454
They tell you the fine, what it's going to be.

37:44.474 --> 37:46.657
And they're blocking the box.

37:46.677 --> 37:48.459
Do you keep the car in New York?

37:48.479 --> 37:52.924
I did until our garage went up to $600 a month.

37:52.984 --> 38:00.053
And I said, $600 a month, you can take a lot of limousines for $600.

38:01.555 --> 38:05.179
Taxis are cheap.

38:05.564 --> 38:13.596
And these car hire places that you call and they have a car at your door in 10 minutes.

38:13.897 --> 38:23.791
I mean, when you're doing $600 a month plus the insurance and plus everything else, it's just... So why did you move?

38:23.972 --> 38:30.001
You mentioned in the Times piece you went by the old house and there's other flowers and you missed the pool.

38:30.862 --> 38:32.905
Yeah, I mean... Was this more of a...

38:34.167 --> 38:40.115
It was a creative move, but... No, it was, it was, it was, it was time.

38:40.635 --> 38:41.176
That was it.

38:41.196 --> 38:42.718
I mean, we'd been there for 24 years.

38:43.339 --> 38:44.300
I felt stepped out.

38:45.802 --> 38:51.449
I felt because I had written eight books, which was published largely in Los Angeles.

38:51.469 --> 38:58.618
And I wasn't, I didn't think I had anything more to say.

38:58.658 --> 39:01.862
I wasn't really, it was just, it was,

39:02.905 --> 39:05.909
And so we talked about it, talked about it, talked about it.

39:05.929 --> 39:12.397
And then one day we said, let's just put the house on the market and see what we can get for it.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.402
And so we called the real estate agent.

39:16.422 --> 39:21.808
The real estate agent came by and sold it one day.

39:22.790 --> 39:23.551
And you got your price.

39:25.052 --> 39:29.178
Actually, we didn't take the highest price because somebody asked.

39:29.198 --> 39:30.159
We had three people bidding.

39:30.199 --> 39:32.001
They gave them boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

39:32.622 --> 39:40.032
And they, the bidding... To the second auction, almost.

39:40.193 --> 39:49.786
Yeah, and it was... The highest bid, which was more than we did, had a second mortgage.

39:49.806 --> 39:51.548
A little baggage that you didn't need.

39:51.568 --> 39:54.552
Yeah, which is the baggage we didn't need.

39:54.913 --> 39:58.598
And the person who bought it would pay all cash and pay our price.

39:58.718 --> 40:00.881
And so we said, all right.

40:01.061 --> 40:01.482
And so...

40:01.647 --> 40:24.297
Then we couldn't back out, because if you get the price, according to the real estate contract, if you get the price, you have to pay according to the California law, you have to pay the commission, which at the time we saw it was at the very top of the market.

40:24.715 --> 40:28.560
And you were ready to move, obviously.

40:28.580 --> 40:29.701
Yeah, we were ready to move.

40:29.721 --> 40:32.665
So then we went back to New York 10 days later.

40:32.685 --> 40:33.926
We didn't have a place to stay.

40:35.568 --> 40:39.894
And this place we hadn't looked at in the fall because it was too expensive.

40:42.257 --> 40:46.882
Well, there was the stock market attack in between.

40:47.423 --> 40:51.308
And you felt like a stock market.

40:51.328 --> 40:53.811
And essentially, we just exchanged prices.

40:54.483 --> 41:02.121
And I think it gives you a little bit of distance now to write about that.

41:02.221 --> 41:11.884
And it also turned out right because I did, I wrote two books the first two years I was there.

41:12.843 --> 41:15.887
You mentioned that Chuckie's your favorite character.

41:15.927 --> 41:18.170
Do you basically have affection for most of them?

41:18.190 --> 41:18.891
Oh, yeah.

41:18.972 --> 41:21.014
And you did mention that there's one you detest.

41:21.655 --> 41:22.336
Sidney Allen.

41:22.356 --> 41:22.557
Yeah.

41:22.677 --> 41:27.223
Sidney Allen, who I... And this is a composite character?

41:27.403 --> 41:33.031
No, it wasn't even a... It was not even a composite character.

41:33.051 --> 41:35.735
But there certainly are people like this out there, right?

41:35.755 --> 41:38.299
Yeah, there certainly are people like this out there.

41:38.319 --> 41:41.483
And we did a movie once.

41:42.024 --> 41:42.124
Yeah.

41:43.606 --> 41:51.076
We got notes from the studio executive, who was a woman, a woman I detested.

41:51.096 --> 41:56.584
And practically everything Jackie says comes out of those notes.

41:56.784 --> 42:02.211
It was Sidney Allen, excuse me.

42:02.352 --> 42:08.500
Practically everything Sidney Allen says comes out of those notes.

42:08.615 --> 42:18.426
I had them pinned to my bulletin board, and whenever I needed to check it, boom, I would take one of her notes and then put it in to dialogue.

42:20.269 --> 42:22.071
And she is still active.

42:22.471 --> 42:24.554
So do you have fun?

42:24.754 --> 42:26.356
Do you write in a computer, Wordpress?

42:26.376 --> 42:26.596
Yeah.

42:27.517 --> 42:36.107
I have since—the first book I wrote on Wordpress, it was Harp.

42:36.155 --> 42:37.758
I've written everything since.

42:39.962 --> 42:42.167
It's a lot easier.

42:43.710 --> 42:45.433
It has one downside.

42:45.974 --> 42:47.958
I think you tend to write longer.

42:48.659 --> 42:49.000
You do.

42:49.501 --> 42:51.284
You can always revise up to the last second.

42:51.304 --> 42:54.050
You can revise up to the last second.

42:54.090 --> 42:55.453
And I think you insert things.

42:56.134 --> 42:58.298
And also, because I keep my notes,

42:59.273 --> 43:01.176
also on the computer.

43:01.196 --> 43:03.159
It's easier to find things.

43:04.981 --> 43:09.868
Before I was always going through the notebooks and trying to find stuff.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.232
Now you just do an F2 search.

43:14.355 --> 43:16.157
I love it.

43:16.218 --> 43:18.921
My eyes are going to hell.

43:20.123 --> 43:26.693
We're always buying computers.

43:26.713 --> 43:28.335
I just wanted

43:28.636 --> 43:32.680
I just bought a new compact desk.

43:32.700 --> 43:38.146
John does not like a desk model, but I'm a big sucker.

43:38.286 --> 43:50.379
I bought a new compact desk model with a 350 megabyte hard drive, which means you can put in everything.

43:50.399 --> 43:55.464
And I got it on sale for $999.

43:55.544 --> 43:57.546
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:58.235 --> 44:04.110
which is really expensive.

44:04.231 --> 44:10.969
Say hi, hi, babe.

44:11.109 --> 44:11.711
I've got to haul.

44:11.731 --> 44:13.054
I've got to move you a quarter.
