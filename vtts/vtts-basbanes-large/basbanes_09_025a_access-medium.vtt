00:03.102 --> 00:04.765
Okay.

00:05.225 --> 00:06.147
The tape is rolling.

00:06.167 --> 00:07.389
I'll just put that there.

00:07.729 --> 00:15.963
And tell me here, if you don't mind, a few general questions, how you see this fitting into the corpus, so to speak.

00:16.544 --> 00:22.393
Well, I suppose in the most reductive sense, you know, there's been reductive.

00:22.728 --> 00:30.336
These books have followed certain stages in my own life in some way or another.

00:31.017 --> 00:38.625
And this one is, you know, they sort of echo some concerns that I've been recently living through.

00:38.806 --> 00:44.011
I suppose family pictures would be the exception because it took me way, way back.

00:45.353 --> 00:52.060
But, you know, in the recent, I would say, five or six years of my life,

00:52.512 --> 00:54.034
Everyone has died.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.137
There have been a lot of deaths.

00:56.758 --> 01:02.565
My mother died a long time ago, but my father died, and he was in my care before then.

01:02.645 --> 01:11.156
And my grandparents, who had lived into their 90s and were still there, you know, and completely with it, and sort of the center of our family died.

01:12.158 --> 01:13.920
A very, what we call, good death.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.123
My dad's death was not a good death.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.465
This is all within the last five years?

01:20.485 --> 01:35.844
Yeah, and I really feel, you know, I've always been sort of death-ridden and, you know, aware of mortality in a way that I think is probably highly inappropriate, I mean, from a very young age.

01:36.365 --> 01:39.008
Can I interject something?

01:39.029 --> 01:40.570
You talked with Alan Mundy.

01:40.590 --> 01:43.074
Alan, do you know what Sunday was yesterday?

01:44.756 --> 01:46.498
No, I said the Shakespearean birth game.

01:47.491 --> 01:50.055
I said, do you know that he died on his 52nd birthday?

01:51.316 --> 01:51.857
No, I didn't.

01:52.057 --> 01:54.160
I said, do you know how old I'm going to be in my next birthday?

01:54.240 --> 01:54.701
Me too.

01:54.761 --> 01:56.604
Next month.

01:57.805 --> 01:59.408
I'll be 52 in November.

01:59.428 --> 02:00.749
It's a little further off.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.372
But he died on his 52nd birthday.

02:02.392 --> 02:05.356
And I said, every time, he said, most guys, it's with their fathers.

02:05.376 --> 02:10.143
I said, oh, when I passed Keith to 29 and Byron, I said, I've always said, what have I done?

02:11.745 --> 02:15.490
Anyway, I share the, what I'm trying to say, I guess, is I share the spirit.

02:16.162 --> 02:18.525
Oh, yeah, just craziness about it.

02:18.665 --> 02:23.131
And, you know, my mother died at 60, and I've always been like, shoot, that seems very bad.

02:23.151 --> 02:24.593
That's pretty darn good.

02:24.613 --> 02:28.879
And I think, you know, eight years from now, you know.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.344
So at any rate, I think I've always been a little crazy anyhow.

02:32.504 --> 02:38.392
And then I think this book, this really emerges out of these kind of really, I see a red light.

02:38.512 --> 02:42.878
I think it emerges out of those kinds of things.

02:43.145 --> 02:49.556
And then a lot of other sort of interesting concerns, but most sort of directly.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.798
That is pretty interesting.

02:50.838 --> 02:57.970
So it's not a question of externalizing the art from your life.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.214
It's impossible.

03:00.234 --> 03:08.848
Yeah, and in a way, I feel that at this point, the first time...

03:09.132 --> 03:11.057
I'm going to line them up.

03:11.237 --> 03:14.244
I'm going to have another one of those guys myself.

03:14.264 --> 03:15.748
Unbelievable ways to go.

03:15.768 --> 03:16.189
Yeah.

03:16.329 --> 03:21.160
That's a good idea.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.804
It's terrible.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.982
Yeah, it's equally my fault.

03:25.002 --> 03:26.183
I came in here.

03:26.263 --> 03:27.784
I was early, too.

03:27.804 --> 03:28.565
Yeah, me too.

03:28.585 --> 03:28.965
Always early.

03:28.985 --> 03:31.408
With Sally, I said, Sally, how long have you been here?

03:31.428 --> 03:32.889
She said, I've been here since about four.

03:32.909 --> 03:34.590
I said, you sure she's not here?

03:34.730 --> 03:36.772
And she said, no.

03:37.213 --> 03:37.533
Yeah.

03:38.514 --> 03:43.458
Sally is my, I'm sorry, go ahead.

03:43.578 --> 03:44.579
No, you too.

03:46.821 --> 03:47.001
Go ahead.

03:47.021 --> 03:48.363
And I forget what the question was.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.985
Well, we were talking, I guess, about externalizing and

03:51.252 --> 03:57.124
It's impossible to externalize events from your life, to separate, I guess, your art from your life.

03:58.187 --> 04:02.877
For me, I mean, there are people who work much, at a much greater distance than photography.

04:02.897 --> 04:10.172
I mean, I don't work as close as someone like Updike has, or Roth has inside.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.884
But, you know, I do work fairly close.

04:13.904 --> 04:19.255
I mean, no one has ever pointed a finger at me and said, you know, you used me.

04:19.435 --> 04:22.381
But people have said, I told you that story.

04:23.423 --> 04:25.106
And I said, I know you did.

04:25.928 --> 04:28.413
But you weren't necessarily using events.

04:28.634 --> 04:30.618
I guess you were using feelings.

04:30.798 --> 04:31.499
Yeah.

04:31.580 --> 04:32.802
And they were...

04:32.950 --> 04:34.552
energizing in a way.

04:34.612 --> 04:46.124
Yeah, when something someone tells you suddenly seems to work as you append it to one of your characters, it's probably the most unlikely character to, from their perspective, to append it.

04:46.184 --> 04:53.772
Were you mindfully responding to these deaths?

04:54.333 --> 04:56.796
Well, I was very preoccupied with the whole idea.

04:56.816 --> 04:58.878
Preoccupied?

04:58.898 --> 05:02.822
Yeah, with death and dying for a while, and sort of what seemed to be

05:04.034 --> 05:04.695
It seems to be.

05:04.895 --> 05:14.328
I mean, you know, I've always sort of thought of life as a kind of awful thing we've moved through with wonderful, wonderful moments embedded in.

05:14.348 --> 05:19.335
And, you know, I've always thought of myself as someone who has been able to enjoy those moments.

05:19.355 --> 05:32.252
I think, you know, with the death of these wonderful old people that I have loved so dearly, I really began to see you since, you know, how...

05:32.671 --> 05:35.176
Life closes the same way for everyone.

05:35.196 --> 05:38.622
It's very diminishing and hard.

05:38.642 --> 05:46.236
I'd always sort of known that intellectually, but I really witnessed it and began to, you know, imagine it for myself.

05:46.256 --> 05:48.881
You know, I will not be as I have been.

05:49.022 --> 05:50.224
I will be, you know.

05:50.605 --> 05:52.628
Is this two years between novels?

05:52.809 --> 05:54.612
It is.

05:54.929 --> 06:04.499
Was this a work in progress when the last one came out, or was this something more or less... I think this one was something I wasn't ready to even focus on.

06:04.519 --> 06:08.644
I mean, I wrote the last one and sort of... Because they really are different.

06:08.744 --> 06:09.385
Yeah, right.

06:09.425 --> 06:10.125
There's no question about it.

06:10.145 --> 06:10.326
Right.

06:11.247 --> 06:23.620
But I wrote the last one sort of in the middle of these dying convests, and I sort of, I thought, I need to be doing something, and I chose something that was of great interest to me.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.826
I felt as though I were writing a long essay about love, in a way, in that book.

06:28.846 --> 06:40.239
And it seemed very... But it seemed very remote from the things which were driving me crazy and, you know, making me very sad.

06:40.259 --> 06:42.822
And it helped me turn away from them.

06:43.583 --> 06:47.487
And then I think this was the book that was waiting for me after that.

06:47.847 --> 06:51.852
In terms of formulating the story and...

06:52.034 --> 06:54.625
What came first?

06:54.645 --> 07:00.390
I mean, were these emotions, was it these emotions that were, you know, bubbling?

07:00.843 --> 07:06.310
It's hard for me to remember what came first.

07:06.370 --> 07:08.392
I always ask these creative questions.

07:08.412 --> 07:19.887
I knew it would be about this old woman, and I knew that I wanted, finally, to be writing about this whole race thing that was part of my own growing up.

07:20.067 --> 07:26.395
The race thing is a matter of, again, it does interest me how that works its way into this.

07:26.611 --> 07:33.400
And, you know, I began to read a lot about race and read a lot of the history of that particular time in Chicago, too.

07:33.420 --> 07:39.128
And just these, they just all began to slowly pull together.

07:39.148 --> 07:44.576
I wasn't sure what, you know, who in the family would be the main character.

07:44.636 --> 07:50.704
And then I decided, at one point, I thought I would have it be a first-person narration by this man, Alan.

07:50.724 --> 07:55.150
But I thought I might, then I sort of saw how...

07:55.703 --> 08:00.590
Tightly, I'd have to be with him and thought I might like to be more expansive on that.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.591
He's a very interesting character.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.412
I love him.

08:02.432 --> 08:03.694
I love them all, actually.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.598
I love writing this book.

08:06.618 --> 08:08.601
It's very complicated.

08:08.621 --> 08:16.192
I would say it may even be your most complex novel in many respects.

08:16.252 --> 08:17.914
Do you agree with that or maybe not?

08:18.434 --> 08:21.478
I mean, there are a lot of things that you are addressing.

08:21.678 --> 08:22.119
Yeah.

08:22.299 --> 08:26.765
I think it's a toss-up between it and family pictures.

08:26.785 --> 08:31.470
Yeah, family pictures.

08:31.490 --> 08:31.711
Yeah.

08:31.951 --> 08:32.171
Mmm.

08:32.291 --> 08:37.298
Wonderful.

08:37.318 --> 08:38.980
Jolts you awake.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.921
I love spices.

08:39.941 --> 08:46.990
Yeah.

08:47.797 --> 08:57.369
We need to find them for you to have more wine.

08:57.649 --> 08:58.871
Hot and sour.

09:00.753 --> 09:05.238
Lemongrass and shrimp soup.

09:08.943 --> 09:12.167
A number of your critics.

09:12.265 --> 09:17.935
We talk about relationships, which are always in your books.

09:17.955 --> 09:24.105
Is this something you do mindfully as well, or is it just what interests you as a writer?

09:24.125 --> 09:26.529
Yeah, it's what I think is interesting.

09:26.549 --> 09:28.552
It's what I read other books for.

09:28.572 --> 09:33.160
It's why I'm drawn to certain writers myself.

09:33.140 --> 09:49.242
I think it's at the heart of more fiction than people really... I'm always sort of startled that people point this out about my work, because it seems to me it's at the heart of a great deal of fiction.

09:49.222 --> 10:03.581
And that somehow I've gotten labeled as the sort of writer about the family and sort of human relationships, but I thought that's what fiction was about, quite honestly.

10:04.362 --> 10:08.447
And I think that it has been historically.

10:08.527 --> 10:14.715
I mean, we come from the British novel, and the British novel is a novel of domestic relations.

10:15.836 --> 10:17.018
And...

10:17.572 --> 10:23.100
some sort of turning out to the world, which I think I also do, you know, in that tradition.

10:23.721 --> 10:28.708
But I think the, you know, the American novel as interpreted by men has been quite different from that.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.253
And so people are starting to think of the novel once again as domestic.

10:32.313 --> 10:35.077
And people are always asking me, why are there relationships?

10:35.097 --> 10:36.378
Why is there so much family?

10:36.398 --> 10:39.623
And I'm sort of amazed that that could be a question.

10:40.144 --> 10:45.351
And I also think it's not a question people ask of someone like, or would have asked of Raymond Carver.

10:45.837 --> 10:49.242
It seems to me he wrote exclusively about family and relationships.

10:50.163 --> 10:52.566
Why wouldn't they?

10:53.247 --> 11:05.483
They didn't think of him first as domestic, they thought of him first as working class, and also of the stylistic aspect of his work, because he sort of revolutionized.

11:05.716 --> 11:08.299
a short story in a certain way.

11:08.319 --> 11:26.903
But his topic, his subject, was the relationship, was, you know, domestic life with how husbands and wives get along, and parents and children, and, you know, he turned outside to the economic life of people and how it pushed in on them, that sort of stuff.

11:26.923 --> 11:29.246
Does this slightly upset you with that?

11:29.267 --> 11:33.512
I think women are, you know, if they are doing this, they're seen as sort of

11:33.593 --> 11:44.849
Except that the two reviews I'm thinking of were both written by women, you know, of Gayle Coughlin and that, and Michiko and Natasha.

11:44.909 --> 11:54.522
No, I utterly agree that... It is interesting that, you know, when you mention that, but it is women who are bringing this up, aren't they, in the reviews?

11:54.502 --> 12:11.329
You mustn't say this, but I think Gail Caldwell much prefers male writers, and the more macho the better, and she's just a complete sucker and writes this utterly ridiculous prose about someone like Tim O'Brien, because she sees him as this sort of hero.

12:11.309 --> 12:17.099
But that's a nasty thing to say, and you must never quote.

12:17.119 --> 12:19.643
I never discuss other reviews.

12:19.844 --> 12:25.554
And why she chooses to review me, also, over and over again when she hates me.

12:25.594 --> 12:28.519
With the same complaints.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.482
But I do think

12:30.597 --> 12:34.583
It is interesting, and don't worry about this.

12:34.683 --> 12:46.400
I actually was misquoted once in Newsweek with this, quoting from Diane Johnson, who has a wonderful introduction to her collection of critical essays.

12:47.682 --> 12:50.706
Critical essays, the title of the collection is Terrorists and Nautilists.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.871
But in the introduction, she's talking about how

12:54.172 --> 13:05.488
Everyone has known and has had to know all along how to read male fiction written by men and understands that when you're writing about a sailing voyage, that's a metaphor.

13:05.908 --> 13:12.057
When you're writing about getting in a car and driving across the country to Colorado, that's a metaphor.

13:12.077 --> 13:15.542
When you're writing about catching the great white whale, that's a metaphor.

13:15.562 --> 13:23.213
You know, I went to view two weeks ago, Patrick O'Brien in New York, and he said, you know, when I'm writing about the ocean and living on a ship, he said, that's a metaphor.

13:23.353 --> 13:23.453
Yeah.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.155
But people aren't willing to see.

13:25.195 --> 13:28.379
These aren't just stories of the bounding days.

13:28.480 --> 13:34.647
It's a metaphor for people living in very close places, and it's really the same thing, isn't it?

13:34.668 --> 13:48.225
Yeah, and people just aren't really, I mean, Diane Johnson's point was that people aren't willing to see, and she said men haven't learned to read the female metaphors, home, you know, garden, family, and I think women,

13:48.442 --> 13:51.287
similarly haven't learned to read you this metaphor.

13:51.327 --> 13:52.809
They're very dismissive.

13:52.949 --> 14:05.189
I do think, in fact, female critics are much more dismissive, or even the people who embrace you, embrace you not because you're doing something ambitious, but because finally you're talking about women and children.

14:06.471 --> 14:14.584
So I think the embraces by women is almost as difficult in some ways as the slap in the face by women who say you're just doing the same.

14:15.037 --> 14:17.480
It's a curious, curious phenomenon.

14:17.500 --> 14:23.146
Well, do you find that male reviewers probably had an ironic, paratoxical kind of way response?

14:23.166 --> 14:26.069
They're much more careful, probably because they've been taught they have to be.

14:27.030 --> 14:31.175
We're back on.

14:33.838 --> 14:36.261
We were talking about something that was pretty interesting.

14:36.281 --> 14:36.981
Men, women?

14:37.402 --> 14:37.642
Yeah.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.244
The way fiction gets seen.

14:39.264 --> 14:41.186
You don't mind talking about these things.

14:41.266 --> 14:44.790
I mean, I have a book.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.774
and I wouldn't be here if I didn't like it and wanted to talk to you about it.

14:50.176 --> 14:57.222
I am interested, however, in the characterization of the journalist, how she came into this.

14:58.803 --> 15:13.836
She wasn't originally there, but then I actually read an article about a journalist who arrived to interview, not for the New Yorker, but for another magazine, the writer M.F.K.

15:13.856 --> 15:14.196
Fisher.

15:14.637 --> 15:15.838
Oh, she's great.

15:15.858 --> 15:15.958
Yeah.

15:16.158 --> 15:20.627
and arrived with his leg broken.

15:20.667 --> 15:26.479
And that seemed to me just a tremendously interesting idea.

15:26.499 --> 15:29.204
So I sort of began to fool around with Lynette.

15:29.224 --> 15:37.120
Once I rejected the idea of Alan narrating it in the first person and realized I really wanted to be able to

15:37.522 --> 15:39.524
move around among the characters.

15:43.327 --> 15:57.339
Then this other idea seemed very possible, and the minute I sort of thought of Lynette, you know, I just invented her right away, sort of her own kind of, you know, slightly fluid moral sense.

15:58.580 --> 16:01.843
I mean, I liked everyone in this book.

16:01.923 --> 16:03.925
I loved writing about all of them.

16:03.945 --> 16:06.347
I mean, I liked her, even though she was sort of

16:06.766 --> 16:09.650
You know, she's someone who just is hustling to survive.

16:09.750 --> 16:13.194
She's really, you know, and she hasn't had such a great life.

16:13.475 --> 16:20.343
And she's, you know, I see her as someone kind of likable, almost present.

16:20.363 --> 16:24.188
Talking in terms of architecture, is she essential?

16:24.208 --> 16:28.033
Did you find me to see her as essential?

16:28.214 --> 16:30.036
She certainly let me do certain things.

16:30.176 --> 16:33.280
I think if I hadn't had her, I might have found other ways of doing them.

16:33.698 --> 16:36.182
A journalist is good, isn't it?

16:36.202 --> 16:38.745
I mean, as a device.

16:39.126 --> 16:39.326
Yeah.

16:39.487 --> 16:44.234
I mean, I might have just quoted some articles written about Lily.

16:44.334 --> 16:48.159
I wanted to have that public perspective of Lily enter the book.

16:48.179 --> 17:00.718
The thing which, you know, Alan had had to face, and his siblings had had to face, or his one sister anyway, which was encountering their mother this way, and a version of what that way was.

17:01.289 --> 17:05.835
And it struck me that this would be this wonderful opportunity to actually include some journalism.

17:08.178 --> 17:18.012
I like the idea, too, of writing in that voice, you know, kind of having that snazzy, jazzy, you know, kind of faster voice.

17:18.032 --> 17:22.337
Sentence-to-sentence paragraphs, snapping.

17:22.978 --> 17:26.503
But that was, in fact, the sort of public view of this character.

17:26.939 --> 17:37.536
And that was one important... I mean, in part, I think the novel is about how we can or cannot know other people and how we can or cannot fully understand them.

17:38.337 --> 17:41.703
And so I wanted to have a lot of different versions of Lily.

17:41.743 --> 17:51.358
You know, the version that occurs in Paul's letters, the version that she wrote herself, the version that I tell as the narrator of this book.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.583
And Lynette's version is just another...

17:54.918 --> 17:56.580
way of looking at her.

17:56.940 --> 18:02.627
And, you know, the problem for Alan is, sort of, who was Lily?

18:02.807 --> 18:03.628
Who is Lily?

18:03.648 --> 18:04.909
And then who was Lily?

18:05.910 --> 18:08.914
And, you know, how can I love her and grieve her?

18:09.835 --> 18:18.424
And, you know, even after she's dead, he keeps getting these new versions of Lily.

18:18.444 --> 18:21.988
Now that we've articulated it, and as I think about it, it is an

18:22.711 --> 18:26.598
an element in a lot of your work is this unlayering.

18:26.618 --> 18:32.488
People see these layers of people.

18:32.508 --> 18:34.972
The whole question of whether we can know one another.

18:34.992 --> 18:40.281
In stages peeled away, we see almost like a photograph

18:40.497 --> 18:45.605
and developing, and you use that as some... Yeah, in family pictures, yeah.

18:45.665 --> 19:06.538
But that's the real interest of mine, is sort of, you know, self-understanding and the understanding of others, and how sort of desperately we struggle with that, and how sometimes by luck we sort of intuit another, but how often...

19:06.822 --> 19:12.349
And I felt that way very much about both my parents.

19:12.409 --> 19:19.579
I have a lot of both of their writings because they were both very prolific writers, my dad professionally and my mom just because she was.

19:21.962 --> 19:28.711
And they just still feel like fundamentally mysteries to me.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.354
But I think our parents probably more than anyone else.

19:32.015 --> 19:34.939
I mean, we know them first in one such

19:35.240 --> 20:01.602
clearly defined way and then we have to accommodate the sense that they had this long life before us and then they you know that they were changing even as we knew them and they're the most mysterious i think our parents and that's probably what interested me too when writing this book finally i've got two daughters one almost 14 they're 13 months apart yes but it's it's something to see

20:02.257 --> 20:03.719
yourself or your kid's eyes.

20:03.899 --> 20:04.660
Yeah.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.282
Really, to try and do it.

20:06.302 --> 20:10.026
I remember seeing my parents in my eyes.

20:10.226 --> 20:12.849
I'm trying to see, I mean, do it.

20:12.869 --> 20:15.592
My wife took my dust jacket picture.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.895
Did a nice job.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.757
I had a Jerry Bauer picture.

20:19.857 --> 20:20.517
Oh, yeah.

20:20.537 --> 20:21.919
They sent them up here.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.621
Isn't that funny?

20:23.641 --> 20:25.803
But I had it, but Colt doesn't want to pay for them.

20:25.823 --> 20:26.524
Ah.

20:26.544 --> 20:27.145
That's cool.

20:27.185 --> 20:27.625
That's fine.

20:27.645 --> 20:29.708
They'd rather spend the money on advertising.

20:29.728 --> 20:29.848
Yeah.

20:29.868 --> 20:29.968
Fine.

20:30.607 --> 20:36.144
My wife said, but my kids were picking up.

20:36.184 --> 20:37.809
She did a nice job.

20:38.792 --> 20:41.601
And Jerry makes you like everything.

20:41.621 --> 20:43.266
So she did fine.

20:43.482 --> 20:45.264
I said, Father, what do you think?

20:45.284 --> 20:46.485
And she said, Dad, no offense.

20:46.525 --> 20:48.027
She said, but you look your age.

20:48.908 --> 20:52.392
It's a thing you don't want to do.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.294
And I said, and what might that be?

20:54.334 --> 20:57.417
You know, where are we?

20:57.978 --> 21:03.504
You know, how do I appear to a 14-year-old kid?

21:03.965 --> 21:04.065
Yeah.

21:04.085 --> 21:04.265
Old.

21:04.425 --> 21:08.249
As an old teacher, to use her expression, I don't feel like an old teacher.

21:08.269 --> 21:10.772
You know what we interviewed the day before yesterday was Mary Wesley.

21:11.950 --> 21:19.199
an 80-something year old British writer who writes really sexy books.

21:19.539 --> 21:39.443
You know, you're curious about this in a very delicate way, but she says, you know, where is it written that at the age of 70 you start being interested in sex or religion or whatever?

21:39.980 --> 21:44.910
I can't try to paraphrase, but it was wonderful.

21:46.092 --> 21:47.335
It was very good.

21:49.759 --> 21:55.170
But would you say that the relationship between Alan and

21:55.488 --> 22:05.819
and his mother is kind of a development of this concern that you were having as your parents moving along.

22:06.019 --> 22:14.008
Yes, I mean, and the fact is that more sort of happens for Alan in terms of his understanding of his mother after she dies.

22:14.208 --> 22:20.635
I mean, when she's there, he's not able to...

22:21.509 --> 22:35.290
he's just sort of frozen in his own patterns vis-a-vis her, and he finds himself sort of reduced to boyhood again in a certain way in his resentment of her and in their kind of interaction they have.

22:35.851 --> 22:48.850
And then, you know, there is this thing that I was sort of thinking of in the book, this sort of gift of memory, and I feel that very much with all the people who've died in my life, that

22:50.281 --> 23:02.656
those particular resentments, those particular things, you can let go of them and remember the other parts of the person, which probably you couldn't have done in life.

23:02.676 --> 23:09.825
I mean, they'd come around, they'd start in on you in the way they always did, or they'd say the wrong thing, and you'd be instantly irritated.

23:10.405 --> 23:12.348
And I don't think that's sentimental.

23:12.388 --> 23:16.493
There's one review that accused me of sentimentality.

23:16.513 --> 23:19.056
It said if I'd been a more honest person, I would have said,

23:19.643 --> 23:23.648
Because he didn't have a nice mother, he started to invent one after she died.

23:26.171 --> 23:36.623
I mean, that's so misses what I thought my point was, which was that we do get chosen in these responses of people who are so important to us.

23:36.643 --> 23:38.825
And we can't see the other side of them.

23:38.845 --> 23:42.529
We can't find our way to the other side.

23:42.549 --> 23:44.892
So we know they're there.

23:45.057 --> 24:11.082
I do think that one of the great gifts of memory is that you recall the person whole, and you recall the things that you were sort of blinded to in life because they were new parents in particular, and they had such power, and they shaped you.

24:11.602 --> 24:41.541
they came down on you in some ways and dismissed parts of you and that sort of thing and judged parts of you but i think that there is a release into not a sort of sufi love nothing like that but a kind of sense of how complex they were that they had other lives too you say and of course alan in this case you know has all this testimony of the many other kinds of lives that really live he has

24:41.926 --> 24:58.830
all this written testimony of it, which was part of what I was trying to do, was to make it possible for someone in front of the reader to confront these other senses of a person who'd been just very, very difficult for him.

24:59.591 --> 25:04.558
Had he been the narrator as he considered, it's not quite...

25:05.062 --> 25:08.469
Certainly, structurally, it would have been a different book.

25:08.489 --> 25:09.511
Very much, yeah.

25:09.691 --> 25:12.937
I think he would have had to have found and read things.

25:14.039 --> 25:18.328
I mean, I even feel Princess Gabby's perspective.

25:19.390 --> 25:26.884
Once I'd written a little bit of Lily, I just sort of thought, no, I have to be able to inhabit Lily for some of his books.

25:27.370 --> 25:30.737
Don't you think she still would have been the primary focus?

25:31.960 --> 25:35.828
Well, I see them as sort of balanced.

25:35.908 --> 25:41.240
I mean, Lily is, of course, in a certain way, the center of the book, and the book is titled after her.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.964
The title of the character.

25:42.984 --> 25:43.084
Yeah.

25:43.553 --> 25:52.227
She's not a person who is changed or, you know, there's no dynamic around Lily in the curse of the book.

25:52.347 --> 26:01.301
Everything that happens to her has been decided before, I mean, even her death, which happens in the curse of the book, but it's something that was decided and fixed.

26:02.142 --> 26:06.108
This is something she knew she was going to do when she reached a certain stage in her life.

26:08.452 --> 26:09.814
Whereas I saw Alan...

26:10.655 --> 26:22.931
maybe is a less important character in the book, but is the person whose life changes or shifts because of what goes on in the book, and therefore is a sort of more dynamic character.

26:22.951 --> 26:25.114
I mean, it changes only up to a point.

26:25.294 --> 26:33.204
I mean, part of what I wanted to say was we can't utterly have a revelation that will utterly change our lives when we're 50 years old.

26:33.224 --> 26:37.590
I mean, we have made lives which count on us being a certain way.

26:37.874 --> 26:43.644
But he does, in fact, he is allowed to see things differently.

26:43.664 --> 26:47.370
And he, well, he works to see things differently.

26:47.390 --> 26:53.060
Had he narrated the book, I think that would have been the first time you'd have had a male narrated book, right?

26:53.140 --> 26:53.600
Of a book.

26:53.721 --> 27:00.692
I've had them, the long, short story in Inventing the Abbots was... This doesn't cow you in any way, intimidate you?

27:01.494 --> 27:01.554
No.

27:01.574 --> 27:02.295
No, and I thought the...

27:02.731 --> 27:08.919
I did rites and prose in his voice, and I felt perfectly comfortable with it.

27:08.939 --> 27:17.070
I mean, assuming male persona and male sexuality and all that, that doesn't intimidate you at all?

27:17.250 --> 27:32.029
No, I feel, I mean, even in the third person, I sort of sat on, have done, I mean, I've had male characters, I think, who's deepest feeling, I mean, you know, David, the husband in family pictures, and Max, the son, and...

27:33.511 --> 27:49.613
You know, I mean, there was one point which some friends were talking about with Doug, about my writing male characters, and this wonderful friend who's an artist actually said,

27:50.015 --> 27:54.299
You know, I mean, it seems as though somehow you've found out about how men think.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.923
And Doug said, yeah, doesn't I?

27:58.604 --> 28:01.707
How did you find out?

28:02.368 --> 28:04.350
I'm so pleased.

28:04.690 --> 28:07.553
That is a compliment.

28:07.573 --> 28:07.653
Yes.

28:07.673 --> 28:12.057
And, I mean, obviously Doug said it as a joke, but, you know, I've grown up.

28:12.077 --> 28:13.999
I've had two brothers.

28:15.081 --> 28:16.102
I've been married twice.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.465
You talk about deja vu.

28:19.748 --> 28:21.471
I know I have these quotes from you.

28:22.392 --> 28:23.874
I know we've discussed this.

28:24.174 --> 28:25.737
This whole business of writing as a man.

28:25.937 --> 28:27.019
Probably so.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.401
Maybe because of family pictures.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.243
Because it's interesting.

28:30.263 --> 28:31.645
You told me what you did.

28:31.665 --> 28:33.468
You did grow up in a household.

28:33.588 --> 28:40.999
Yeah, and then, you know, I had a son, and I sort of watched his mind, which was at a certain point pretty transparent to me.

28:41.039 --> 28:45.125
Later, he began to draw some curtains, and he's very good at it.

28:45.145 --> 28:48.490
So he finally really established a kind of...

28:49.280 --> 28:50.903
privacy process, poor guy.

28:51.744 --> 29:01.239
But, you know, I think I sort of saw his mind kind of learning about the world in the way that a boy does.

29:03.402 --> 29:05.626
And I just, I don't feel that that's so alien.

29:05.646 --> 29:12.537
I, you know, I also don't feel that, and I think there was probably a time in our lives when, you know, women

29:12.770 --> 29:18.398
lives and men's lives were so different that one was not very imaginable to the other.

29:20.040 --> 29:25.488
But that's in the last, certainly in the last 30 or 40 years, the country has changed.

29:25.508 --> 29:32.839
I mean, men have always been privileged to imagine the female life, some of the greatest books in the literature, the male imagining of the female.

29:32.859 --> 29:37.025
I mean, and you look at Hemingway just describing women, it's almost Latin.

29:37.626 --> 29:39.148
And he didn't, he couldn't do it.

29:39.938 --> 29:50.249
But when you look at Flaubert, when you look at Tolstoy, I mean, there are some people whose greatest books... Even Fitzgerald, to a degree, I think.

29:52.352 --> 29:55.655
Well, they were sort of iconic, since his work.

29:55.815 --> 29:57.838
Of Proust.

29:57.858 --> 30:00.421
He had it, didn't he?

30:00.701 --> 30:03.184
My wife just finished the Flaubert biography.

30:04.645 --> 30:05.807
The Balzac, I'm sorry.

30:06.047 --> 30:08.089
It was only before that, but...

30:08.963 --> 30:14.768
She did the Flobert, then she did the Balzac, and now she's doing the Bronte, which I just read.

30:14.928 --> 30:16.129
What's the last one?

30:16.149 --> 30:19.552
The new Bronte by Linda Gordon, which is wonderful.

30:19.572 --> 30:20.493
I haven't read it.

30:20.513 --> 30:22.955
I've read a lot of biographies of her, but not that much.

30:22.975 --> 30:24.737
This one is excellent.

30:25.277 --> 30:26.138
I had never read it before.

30:26.158 --> 30:33.244
Before you talk about, here are three sisters writing a lot of men's names, you know, and when they found out, I mean, Zachary became so vicious.

30:33.284 --> 30:35.306
She was angry.

30:35.326 --> 30:36.246
This is a woman.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.008
I mean, she was all this.

30:38.292 --> 30:40.295
anger and emotion.

30:40.776 --> 30:49.510
I mean, they really resented the fact that she didn't express things that they were maybe even better than they were doing.

30:49.530 --> 30:53.937
But I think in part it was because her brother was so accessible to her.

30:53.997 --> 30:57.964
I mean, they were all sort of in each other's minds from the very early stages.

30:59.045 --> 31:00.067
You should really read that book.

31:00.087 --> 31:00.688
It's very funny.

31:01.462 --> 31:08.856
The circumstances of their lives are just so fascinating, and the death, the death, the death.

31:08.876 --> 31:10.479
Yes, talk about death-ridden.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.305
She has the saddest life I think I've ever read.

31:13.345 --> 31:14.627
I just, you know.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.365
I mean, I didn't read that one, I think, but I've read others.

31:19.768 --> 31:23.213
That horrible old man.

31:24.075 --> 31:35.974
Forgive me if we haven't really, but we have actually.

31:36.014 --> 31:39.920
Yeah, we're doing good.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.184
I know that they may leave, you know.

31:42.316 --> 31:43.619
You've got your lead.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.642
I never lead one of these things.

31:45.783 --> 31:48.047
What's your lead going to be?

31:48.067 --> 31:50.592
Oh, I never say.

31:53.377 --> 31:56.103
Because I reserve the right to change it.

31:56.123 --> 32:02.435
But I always feel I'm in good shape when I have my lead.

32:02.555 --> 32:04.138
I always like to

32:04.574 --> 32:08.340
come back to where I started, in one way or another.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.042
No, I guess I don't know what that is.

32:10.062 --> 32:17.373
I sort of imagined it was with this character, Lynette, you know, kind of what she would need to get herself going in the story she was writing.

32:17.633 --> 32:19.837
And that was really fun, you know.

32:20.217 --> 32:20.918
She's not nice.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.080
No, she's not.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.844
She's kind of horrible.

32:24.864 --> 32:32.996
I've known a lot of journalists like her, I have to say, of both sexes, and it was irrelevant with sex.

32:33.016 --> 32:33.417
I mean,

32:33.970 --> 32:39.236
My agent said, you know, oh, and then she goes in and looks into their bedroom.

32:40.117 --> 32:42.639
And I said, why is that?

32:42.719 --> 32:45.142
That's not surprising at all.

32:46.223 --> 32:46.563
Me too.

32:46.583 --> 32:47.665
Me too.

32:47.865 --> 32:48.545
She loves you.

32:48.565 --> 32:52.770
My editor, Alan, he comes in and says, oh, you have this detail.

32:52.790 --> 32:58.476
You describe this woman I have, this woman who is so cessful of Lincoln.

32:58.962 --> 33:02.111
Louise Taper, Mark Taper.

33:02.312 --> 33:05.601
Have you heard of Mark Taper in LA, the Mark Taper poem?

33:05.621 --> 33:06.163
Yes.

33:06.203 --> 33:09.934
She's the third, second...

33:10.387 --> 33:14.113
wife of this baritaker who's better than winning the Mega Bucks.

33:14.474 --> 33:17.900
And all of a sudden, she was able to indulge this passion for Abraham Lincoln.

33:18.381 --> 33:24.091
And for 10 years, she put together this collection at the Huntington Library for the first time ever.

33:24.111 --> 33:30.983
They mounted an exhibition last year of her stuff, their stuff, and the Illinois, and 300,000 people.

33:31.003 --> 33:32.766
She has everything.

33:32.982 --> 33:36.127
So she sort of acquired it by buying?

33:36.567 --> 33:37.148
By buying.

33:37.549 --> 33:38.110
By buying.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.273
Memorabilia and documents.

33:40.293 --> 33:42.216
But better than that, because she has a focus.

33:42.376 --> 33:43.598
She knows about it.

33:43.618 --> 33:44.099
She understands.

33:44.119 --> 33:45.741
She wants all the Mary Lincoln stuff.

33:45.761 --> 33:47.985
She wants all the John Wilkes Booth stuff.

33:48.005 --> 33:53.232
She wants all the... She has all the... She has the earliest notebook of Abraham.

33:53.272 --> 33:55.175
She has this... She does have things.

33:55.215 --> 33:57.158
She has an emancipation crop.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.862
And she's just... How do we get on to this?

33:59.882 --> 34:00.323
But I mean...

34:00.539 --> 34:02.901
They say about her, she collects like a man.

34:05.644 --> 34:06.464
Come on.

34:06.805 --> 34:09.847
Women collect like men all the time.

34:09.867 --> 34:13.351
They're the collectors, after all.

34:13.371 --> 34:14.251
She's great.

34:14.271 --> 34:16.473
I love you.

34:16.634 --> 34:19.496
Why did I bring her up?

34:19.516 --> 34:22.519
Coming around to women and men.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.782
Nope.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.584
Yeah, I think so.

34:27.624 --> 34:29.145
Too much wine.

34:29.378 --> 34:30.780
Well, it's Friday, you know.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.227
It's Friday, but I have to do one more kind of telephone interview.

34:36.568 --> 34:40.014
Oh, really?

34:40.214 --> 34:42.157
Actually, you know, it is really true.

34:42.257 --> 34:46.924
I mean, I really hate being on tour, and I really hate doing interviews.

34:47.144 --> 34:51.030
I mean, I don't drink very much, but I always have had a little bit to drink.

34:51.230 --> 34:51.891
Really?

34:51.911 --> 34:52.011
Yeah.

34:52.548 --> 34:58.602
I mean, I just... To loosen up.

34:58.803 --> 35:06.100
Yeah, because otherwise I'm so... I just get... I find myself sort of being very snippy to people sometimes.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.949
Last week, when we were shooting these pictures, my wife was in the morning, the kids were in school.

35:10.199 --> 35:13.283
She says, here, have a glass of wine.

35:13.303 --> 35:13.804
I said, why?

35:13.824 --> 35:15.025
Because we shot some pictures.

35:15.065 --> 35:17.428
She says, you've got to loosen up a little bit.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.069
She says, you're too stiff.

35:18.089 --> 35:19.110
You're too nervous.

35:19.130 --> 35:20.352
You're too anxious.

35:20.372 --> 35:23.075
You're trying to look too much like the obvious.

35:23.135 --> 35:26.560
And the second group of pictures were wonderful.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.383
As wonderful as they can get.

35:30.585 --> 35:31.386
I think it's true.

35:31.426 --> 35:37.354
Often, I think, the best ones come at the very end of some long, arduous session.

35:37.374 --> 35:40.037
It's just that it affects the photographer's

35:40.304 --> 35:44.520
And the equivalent of giving you a glass of wine, you should sort of warn you about it.

35:44.540 --> 35:48.655
And I also know that she had one good one from the previous two.

35:48.675 --> 35:50.301
That was reassuring, yes.

35:50.762 --> 35:52.288
So we were trying to get the next one.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.020
She did.

35:54.040 --> 35:54.901
It was great.

35:57.243 --> 35:57.884
What do you think?

35:58.244 --> 35:59.285
Can we cover it?

35:59.685 --> 36:00.286
I feel fine.

36:00.566 --> 36:01.827
Yeah, I get plenty of stuff.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.611
Yeah, I mean, I do think, in fact, you have so much from the other record.

36:05.651 --> 36:15.279
I mean, you did mention that certain people did die close to you, and you just kind of saw them have to wonder who they might be.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.122
Make it as specific or as general as you want.

36:18.482 --> 36:20.284
Yeah, a few friends, but in the last...

36:20.264 --> 36:31.422
Five years in my family's life, my grandmother, who was sort of the mother of all mothers to me,

36:31.908 --> 36:42.422
really sort of taught me what to be maternal was, died at the age of 94, my grandfather at the age of 96, and my own father at the age of, I think, 70.

36:44.064 --> 36:47.528
He was the one sort of in my immediate care.

36:47.769 --> 36:48.810
And when was that?

36:48.830 --> 36:50.773
He died three years ago.

36:50.813 --> 36:56.620
And my grandfather was still alive after my father died.

36:58.322 --> 37:00.345
Your grandfather was not his...

37:00.713 --> 37:03.397
My mother died long ago.

37:03.437 --> 37:07.102
I mean, both her parents outlived her family.

37:08.063 --> 37:10.967
Years and years, I think that was just awful.

37:11.447 --> 37:13.590
They outlived several of their children.

37:13.610 --> 37:28.290
Because my mother's generation was, you know, smoked cigarettes, hard drinking, and my grandparents' generation, I mean, plus all the environmental insults we may not know anything about, I'm sure, you know, whatever that may be.

37:28.658 --> 37:33.404
You know, my grandparents were teetotalers, and certainly they never slept.

37:33.424 --> 37:35.567
They were just sort of full of virtue.

37:36.048 --> 37:39.072
I think you covered a lot of this, obviously.

37:39.112 --> 37:39.732
That's good.

37:39.753 --> 37:43.557
I got plenty.

37:43.578 --> 37:46.782
I guess, you know, your first book was published, when, about 10 years ago?

37:46.802 --> 37:47.182
86.

37:47.262 --> 37:48.985
I finished it in 86.

37:49.665 --> 37:54.932
So, did you conceive of an uber at that point?

37:55.733 --> 37:56.414
No, no.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.497
And do you now see...

37:58.966 --> 38:00.609
Everything is part of a body of work.

38:00.930 --> 38:10.210
Well, I feel I've kind of run a certain course, just in terms of this, I guess, biographical reflection.

38:10.270 --> 38:12.314
We could take the check when you're ready.

38:13.076 --> 38:15.902
Or I'll take the check when you're ready.

38:15.962 --> 38:18.848
Biographical reflection on my own life.

38:19.250 --> 38:24.358
And for the first time, I don't have an idea for a novel in my head.

38:24.838 --> 38:26.882
I want to do some short stories.

38:27.362 --> 38:37.798
In part, I think... Usually, as I approach the end of the novel that I'm working on, I'm beginning to sort of...

38:38.200 --> 38:42.488
I passed around a little bit in my nervousness.

38:43.830 --> 38:47.557
And I just didn't really at the end of the book.

38:48.158 --> 38:51.083
In part, I knew there were sort of a lot of life things coming up.

38:51.183 --> 38:53.788
We were building a house, so I knew I'd be very engaged in that.

38:54.008 --> 38:58.076
And we got a dog, and I was very engaged in that.

38:58.096 --> 38:59.398
And, you know, there were just these...

38:59.530 --> 39:04.357
And I'm reading for a literary prize, so I knew that that would take up a lot of my time.

39:04.397 --> 39:05.639
And indeed, it will.

39:05.839 --> 39:08.063
I did one of those.

39:08.083 --> 39:08.363
It's terrible.

39:08.463 --> 39:09.124
You had 200 books.

39:09.204 --> 39:12.709
I'm just reading 60, but I have to read them by mid-June.

39:13.410 --> 39:17.456
So, you know, I knew that I wouldn't really be working right now.

39:17.476 --> 39:20.361
But on the other hand... Are you anxious about that, though?

39:20.681 --> 39:21.062
Well, not.

39:21.222 --> 39:22.724
But yes, also I am.

39:22.824 --> 39:28.693
I mean, I feel kind of relaxed about it, but I also think... I feel...

39:29.129 --> 39:31.831
in a certain way that I don't know what I'll do next.

39:32.032 --> 39:33.153
That's all.

39:33.173 --> 39:34.193
I don't know what I'll do next.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.777
And I feel as though I might do something.

39:37.817 --> 39:41.140
Is that a disquieting feeling or is that a liberating feeling?

39:41.700 --> 39:51.589
I worry a little, but on the other hand, I have a sort of sense of, you know, steps in life that, you know, I will always be trying to do something.

39:51.629 --> 39:52.470
You know what I mean?

39:52.910 --> 39:54.852
I don't, well, anyway.

39:54.872 --> 39:58.495
But one shouldn't deduce from that that you feel somehow that

39:59.690 --> 40:06.700
This body of work is... You've said the stuff that you want to say.

40:06.820 --> 40:19.718
No, but I actually used this analogy with someone else just the other day, but it occurred to me, and I think it's apt, that, you know, if you sort of look at... My work is sort of reflecting these various autobiographical concerns.

40:20.399 --> 40:24.064
I feel as though I've finished my rabbit series.

40:24.084 --> 40:24.465
And...

40:24.800 --> 40:26.582
That's all I've done.

40:26.602 --> 40:37.833
I mean, Updike has a lot of other things in and around and about the Rabbit series, but I sort of feel as though the books that I've written have come very much out of these intensely personal concerns.

40:39.315 --> 40:42.258
And that I'm... Is this Rabbit at Rest, then?

40:42.698 --> 40:43.599
Well, yeah.

40:43.619 --> 40:44.420
I mean, Lily is me.

40:44.540 --> 40:45.621
Alan is me, too.

40:46.422 --> 40:51.347
I mean, I imagine myself being her.

40:51.968 --> 40:57.295
And, I mean, I think I've done it very differently from the way I've done it, certainly.

40:57.315 --> 41:06.246
And I wouldn't want to even try to, you know, seem to be comparing myself to him, because there are those who would not like that in both directions.

41:06.847 --> 41:11.773
But I feel as though somehow a certain ending has come around in my work.

41:11.913 --> 41:14.837
You're making a comparison, which I think is different.

41:15.258 --> 41:16.359
Yeah, yeah.

41:17.260 --> 41:17.841
So...

41:18.091 --> 41:23.340
I feel I've sort of completed a certain body of work in some sense or another.

41:23.801 --> 41:29.992
And I'm not sure what the next step is.

41:30.032 --> 41:32.316
Was this a mindful excursion in that part?

41:32.657 --> 41:33.518
No, it wasn't.

41:34.019 --> 41:38.968
I mean, I sort of only, as I kind of came to the end of this book and really sort of thought...

41:39.286 --> 41:43.973
You know, and I've talked about this a lot to Doug, you know, like, I don't have an idea now.

41:43.993 --> 41:44.473
What's wrong?

41:44.533 --> 41:46.697
You know, and he has been very reassuring.

41:46.897 --> 42:01.337
I know you've written, you know, five books in ten years, and maybe it's time to, yeah, to take a deep breath, and, you know, so... This is the end quote, by the way.

42:01.357 --> 42:03.280
Oh, a deep breath?

42:03.300 --> 42:07.226
I mean, I say sometimes I have my lead, and then I have my kicker.

42:07.246 --> 42:07.386
Uh-huh.

42:08.075 --> 42:14.153
He gave it to me, thanks.
