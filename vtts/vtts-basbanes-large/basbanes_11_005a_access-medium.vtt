WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:03.984
We're talking to Ian.

00:04.084 --> 00:05.866
Ian, yeah.

00:06.547 --> 00:12.774
It's the Gaelic spelling, but it's the same word as Ian.

00:13.675 --> 00:19.541
No, just technically to get the other people you want to contact, it seems to me.

00:21.703 --> 00:22.304
Howard Besser.

00:22.324 --> 00:25.047
I mentioned his name to you, I think.

00:25.347 --> 00:28.350
Howard Besser, he's in the library school here.

00:28.887 --> 00:31.210
Now, whether he's here this week, I don't know.

00:31.430 --> 00:39.180
But he lives in Berkeley, but he does have an appointment also at... I can tell you where.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.002
I've got a reference to him here.

00:42.023 --> 00:42.484
Somewhere.

00:43.004 --> 00:43.164
Yes.

00:44.186 --> 00:45.687
What that book is that you have there?

00:46.328 --> 00:46.809
Hmm?

00:46.869 --> 00:48.431
What book is this that you're holding?

00:48.471 --> 00:52.516
This is my book, which I can't give you a copy.

00:52.536 --> 00:53.597
It's the only copy I have.

00:53.677 --> 00:54.338
But I should be able to...

00:54.503 --> 00:59.388
You can get it, you can get it, maybe, certainly at Cody's in Berkeley.

00:59.408 --> 01:00.269
And the title is?

01:01.210 --> 01:03.151
Resisting the Virtual Life.

01:03.852 --> 01:06.014
The Culture and Politics of Information.

01:06.575 --> 01:07.335
Who's the publisher?

01:07.996 --> 01:08.557
City Lights.

01:09.998 --> 01:16.044
So, in San Francisco, so it should be.

01:16.064 --> 01:20.308
But they have it, it's sort of around.

01:21.908 --> 01:24.372
Oh, it's B as in... Besser, yeah.

01:24.392 --> 01:25.233
Besser, okay.

01:25.854 --> 01:31.702
He's partly at the University of Michigan and he's partly here at the library school.

01:31.762 --> 01:36.630
When Jill arrives, which is in a few minutes, she'll have his phone number here.

01:36.650 --> 01:37.751
Oh, super.

01:37.771 --> 01:38.733
Okay, great.

01:41.356 --> 01:50.650
And he has a... He's good to talk to because he knows what's happening here intimately more than anyone else, but he's also got a critical take, I thought.

01:51.608 --> 01:55.193
And he's not shy about talking about it?

01:55.213 --> 01:55.854
No, not at all.

02:00.782 --> 02:03.846
So his piece is called From Internet to Information Superhighway.

02:04.026 --> 02:04.527
So it's in here?

02:04.707 --> 02:05.048
Yeah.

02:06.530 --> 02:07.572
I know that piece.

02:07.592 --> 02:10.035
Was this published here for the first time?

02:10.055 --> 02:10.256
Yes.

02:11.357 --> 02:12.018
Where did I see it?

02:12.439 --> 02:15.203
Yeah, it's shown up elsewhere.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.481
Okay, good, good, excellent.

02:17.561 --> 02:19.464
I can do an interview with him by phone if necessary.

02:19.484 --> 02:20.245
Yes, exactly.

02:20.426 --> 02:22.008
I much prefer meeting people.

02:22.048 --> 02:23.050
Exactly.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.752
Telephones aren't helpful.

02:26.194 --> 02:26.976
So tell me about this.

02:27.176 --> 02:30.140
Tell me about... I haven't seen it yet.

02:30.341 --> 02:31.803
Oh, yeah.

02:31.823 --> 02:33.946
This is Joe.

02:33.986 --> 02:35.068
May I get you a cup of coffee?

02:35.869 --> 02:38.473
We've been joined by Jillian.

02:38.977 --> 02:54.927
So, we should definitely talk to Howard, if it's a phone conversation, but you might be able to find him here.

02:56.459 --> 03:00.365
These are just the names that I think you should try to get before you go.

03:00.946 --> 03:02.969
You should try to talk to Gray Breckin.

03:02.989 --> 03:06.274
I've already talked to him for two and a half hours, and we're getting together.

03:06.294 --> 03:07.656
He's terrific.

03:07.676 --> 03:10.821
He sounds excellent.

03:12.203 --> 03:15.529
He called back, and it was really to make contact.

03:15.549 --> 03:20.576
We wound up talking for two and a half hours.

03:20.697 --> 03:24.863
Now, he probably told you that there's this very good piece that was published.

03:25.737 --> 03:30.263
on the San Francisco library in a local

03:30.648 --> 03:31.810
Free weekly.

03:31.830 --> 03:32.691
I have all that stuff.

03:32.711 --> 03:33.412
You have that one.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.315
I was with the librarians last night.

03:35.415 --> 03:35.756
Yeah.

03:37.198 --> 03:39.802
Thank goodness I've got a release with wheels on it.

03:40.182 --> 03:41.424
Yeah, right.

03:41.464 --> 03:44.389
Whatever that new free one is called.

03:44.409 --> 03:48.094
It's one that... I mean, Melissa has been dealing with it.

03:48.154 --> 03:48.815
Yeah, I know.

03:48.855 --> 03:49.196
I understand.

03:49.236 --> 03:58.750
I mean, I couldn't believe that you wouldn't have that piece, which I think is the best single short thing done on it.

03:58.770 --> 03:59.151
Okay.

03:59.171 --> 03:59.271
Okay.

03:59.960 --> 04:08.254
I mean, basically, what you should talk to Jill about is, you know, somebody inside the library, on the book side, watching.

04:08.314 --> 04:12.100
Talk about Barclay.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.603
You should talk to Barclay Ogden.

04:13.683 --> 04:15.967
Have you done that yet?

04:15.987 --> 04:16.628
To whom, I'm sorry?

04:16.788 --> 04:17.750
Barclay Ogden.

04:17.810 --> 04:18.070
No.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.092
Jill will tell your name.

04:19.713 --> 04:20.955
Yes, Barclay Ogden.

04:21.075 --> 04:21.756
How do we spell?

04:21.916 --> 04:25.883
B-A-R-C-L-A-Y-O-G-D-E-N.

04:26.605 --> 04:30.470
And he's in charge of the digital program.

04:30.490 --> 04:30.791
Here?

04:31.051 --> 04:32.793
Yes, at Berkeley.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.018
And there's been a lot of difficulty over it.

04:36.038 --> 04:36.378
Oh, really?

04:36.398 --> 04:40.103
Because I think there's a power struggle on some level about who owns it and who doesn't.

04:40.424 --> 04:41.565
I've already been to Michigan.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.528
I've been to Stanford last year.

04:44.049 --> 04:46.132
Cornell, of course, is very, very interesting.

04:46.252 --> 04:49.997
Cornell's doing some things, I think, in Mississippi, California here.

04:49.977 --> 04:50.918
So, yeah.

04:51.279 --> 04:52.681
I'm hoping to set up a day.

04:52.701 --> 04:55.185
I mean, maybe Thursday or Friday.

04:55.305 --> 04:58.670
And so Barkley Ogden is in what department?

04:58.770 --> 05:02.476
He's the head of the conservation department in the library.

05:02.496 --> 05:03.257
His number is 642.

05:03.337 --> 05:03.918
4946.

05:03.938 --> 05:04.539
642.

05:04.579 --> 05:04.839
4946.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.343
4946.

05:07.403 --> 05:08.505
510.

05:08.685 --> 05:15.516
It's interesting because he's a man trained.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.098
Trained in...

05:17.787 --> 05:42.310
the physical conservation of books who has as it were jumped ship in a certain way gone with the fashion gone digital because he has to follow the money in order to keep his program going he has to follow the money which of course is all to do with digitalization and and in fact he's been squeezed microfilming naturally moved into digitization right right yeah a lot of people still

05:42.458 --> 05:47.790
think that microfilming is good, because we know how long microfilm lasts.

05:48.271 --> 05:49.954
Tried and true, that's the argument, yes.

05:50.716 --> 05:54.163
That's what Roger Scott says at Harvard, you know, we know microfilm.

05:54.264 --> 05:57.571
I know, but nobody's really surveyed the readers of microfilm even.

05:57.591 --> 06:01.800
I mean, everybody's totally frustrated, it always has been, with microfilm.

06:02.185 --> 06:12.364
I'm going to Leipzig next month, where their whole unit on preservation, the Germans are really... We'll see.

06:12.384 --> 06:13.186
On preservation?

06:13.406 --> 06:14.689
Because Barkley will know about that.

06:14.789 --> 06:15.149
That's right.

06:15.170 --> 06:23.165
So it would be really useful for me to talk to him before I go to... And that's something you should mention, maybe, of your focus, because he would be... Oh, yes, certainly.

06:23.345 --> 06:23.726
Sorry.

06:23.746 --> 06:24.447
Go right ahead.

06:25.760 --> 06:38.943
Barclay is importantly positioned on the national scene.

06:38.983 --> 06:50.603
He's not just a local enthusiast, he's got a very good grasp of the politics of

06:50.870 --> 06:53.715
of the book and its place.

06:53.975 --> 06:56.679
And so I think he's an important person to search for me.

06:56.859 --> 06:57.961
I think so.

06:58.101 --> 07:01.447
Particularly because he's got a foot in both camps.

07:01.467 --> 07:09.840
I mean, he deeply knows about books as artifacts, as well as being, you know, dragged into the

07:10.107 --> 07:37.903
digitalization because yeah he's in there yeah he's upstairs and so tell me about yourselves and what you do here uh well i mean this about this the reason why howard and these other people are in here this being the book yeah yeah is that um

07:39.065 --> 08:06.726
I'm really a sort of social historian of technology, and so I teamed up with Jim Brook, who's an editor, who's a poet and an editor, who works in Silicon Valley, and saw what was happening.

08:07.381 --> 08:17.436
Jim saw what was happening in Silicon Valley and what was happening to... And the fetish of information.

08:17.456 --> 08:27.371
And so we decided that we would try to... And the hype, the millennial hype over information and its fetishization.

08:27.391 --> 08:30.276
And so we decided that we would... This was about three years ago.

08:30.456 --> 08:35.143
That we would try to pull together a series of critical essays that would...

08:36.068 --> 08:39.812
try to sort of stand back and deal with the hype, you know.

08:40.593 --> 08:42.435
It's interesting you found out the fetishization.

08:42.996 --> 08:44.737
Yeah.

08:45.298 --> 08:45.618
Yeah.

08:45.638 --> 08:48.061
You have to believe it's reached that level.

08:48.502 --> 08:50.123
Oh, there's no question about it.

08:50.143 --> 09:03.578
I mean, it has a long history in the sense that you probably know, but theories of information began to emerge during the Second World War with the

09:03.929 --> 09:33.649
when the war became global and 24-hour, and with very, very noisy equipment, command and control, communication becomes, it's always been important for the imperial project, the landlines, God knows what, but it's etherealization sort of becomes, the questions become really urgent in the 40s, in the early 40s, and so you get Bell Labs combining with small groups of mathematicians like, you know,

09:34.388 --> 09:46.023
You know, Warren Weaver, Shannon, and you get cybernetics as a science being coined in 1948.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.484
It's that kind of mix.

09:47.504 --> 09:52.551
It's interesting that the world is more than 50 years old and most of the world is cybernetics.

09:52.591 --> 09:57.477
Yeah, and it crystallizes because...

09:58.570 --> 10:14.024
You need to theorize it at a moment when you've got all kinds of important questions being asked about encryption, about how to get undegraded messages across space.

10:15.125 --> 10:27.497
And so you can see that, if you look at the history, you can see that the word information becomes a kind of...

10:27.798 --> 10:47.697
buzzword in the as early as the 40s but it doesn't really sort of go it doesn't really get commercialized in the sense until until the what i suppose until the 80s really you begin it really begins to take off you took on a different context i think entirely yeah yeah

10:48.098 --> 10:52.825
No, it doesn't.

10:52.905 --> 10:54.767
No, exactly.

10:55.228 --> 11:13.093
And I think in there somewhere I do have a kind of a history of... Because the interesting thing is that Al Gore, who's the architect of the superhighway, his father was the architect of the first superhighway, namely the interstate system.

11:13.867 --> 11:20.575
And the same kind of height was around, you know, emerged around a freeway system.

11:20.896 --> 11:28.986
I read about that, but they had a couch and ice power made it acceptable by saying it was for national defense, the highways.

11:29.006 --> 11:32.109
That was the only way they could get that feeling about it.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.272
It was, it was, right.

11:34.488 --> 11:48.630
It was more to do with it being funded by the, I mean, this is Chomsky's point, that you can't, you can't, anything that's federal funding, for it not to seem like socialism, you have to call it defense.

11:48.650 --> 11:53.457
So that, and of course it's true for the computer and chip and so on.

11:53.477 --> 11:55.821
These are all done under the umbrella.

11:56.122 --> 12:15.430
of national defense as was the as was the highway system which which happened which i which it needs to be said had very few the boosters no one really was demanding it in the 50s except you know the road lobby road and tire lobby the oil people and you know developers

12:15.815 --> 12:28.231
So as a so-called historian of technology, tell me about your attraction to this particular subject.

12:28.952 --> 12:36.262
Well, what is noticeable when you look at the hype is that this is not the first go-round for this.

12:36.442 --> 12:43.712
Particularly in the American context, again, there's a...

12:43.692 --> 12:58.679
the technical fix is a peculiarly sort of American dream and the demise of the book, the idea... The added context of course is what's happening and what will happen to the book.

12:59.901 --> 13:06.072
The other thing I see why the book has, you know,

13:06.440 --> 13:30.000
been targeted in a way because if you think about education too i mean that everyone this whole sort of philosophy on education for everybody and people are now saying that information is power i mean they're totally admitting it now so that the access to the computer that you know they never admitted that before they never said that if you knew something you were powerful and i think that's come out of this too that

13:29.980 --> 13:35.209
now you're entitled as an ordinary citizen to know everything, right?

13:35.549 --> 13:42.821
And somehow that's equality, that's the American way, that's democracy, right?

13:42.841 --> 13:48.571
But we all know that's not true, of course, but that's how they're touting it too, which I find very interesting.

13:49.272 --> 13:55.903
And consequently, the book has always had that element too of you've got to be able to afford it.

13:56.069 --> 14:03.058
You know, and that whole debate that's going on, that they say, well, everyone can get access in education because the computer is going to be for everybody.

14:03.078 --> 14:07.804
We know that's not true, but, you know, nobody's truly, you know, fighting that, too, you know.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.748
I find that's going to be an issue.

14:10.848 --> 14:16.496
I mean, already they're closing down on the university and saying you can't do certain things, you know, you mustn't... Is that happening here?

14:16.736 --> 14:17.817
Yes, yes.

14:18.218 --> 14:22.363
They haven't quite... I mean, like, they've always closed down on faxes and on telephones.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.905
They've always made you pay, right?

14:23.985 --> 14:25.367
But they haven't quite yet...

14:25.347 --> 14:26.690
cottoned onto the email.

14:26.930 --> 14:27.371
Not yet.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.032
They will do.

14:29.295 --> 14:33.663
So tell me, what do you do here?

14:33.683 --> 14:36.028
I'm the book conservator for the rare materials.

14:36.208 --> 14:36.529
Oh, really?

14:36.609 --> 14:36.870
Yes.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.413
So I restore all the old books.

14:38.493 --> 14:40.116
So I sort of have been

14:40.501 --> 14:43.065
pushed to a corner and I'm quietly working away.

14:43.085 --> 14:45.388
And this is for the university library?

14:45.529 --> 14:52.800
Yes, for the research libraries, for the special collections libraries, which are different from the circulating collections.

14:52.880 --> 14:57.807
In my book, The Gentle Madness, that was my principal concern with the special collections.

14:57.827 --> 15:04.197
Yes, well, the special collections actually are going to be driven into a quiet corner and they're going to continue because there's

15:04.362 --> 15:13.418
Well, they are digitizing Chaucer and some of the medieval manuscripts, but we all know it will never be good enough in the same way you can't digitize paintings, not yet anyway.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.868
You need such a huge memory and such a huge machine to pull them up, but what's the point?

15:19.189 --> 15:24.919
Well, I was at Cornell just a year ago where they're, of course, doing all this digital stuff.

15:24.899 --> 15:26.501
and they showed me what they were doing.

15:26.521 --> 15:30.845
They have this enormous probe of Lafayette.

15:30.905 --> 15:33.408
Oh, the idea of breaking light.

15:33.428 --> 15:38.012
You can see how something's been folded, been handled, been manipulated, and turned.

15:38.113 --> 15:38.753
You can see it.

15:39.094 --> 15:41.356
That's why the original is so important.

15:41.436 --> 15:42.557
At Cornell also.

15:42.978 --> 15:44.139
They're not bagel.

15:44.539 --> 15:45.840
Look, there's guns over there.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.402
It smells like they're not bagel.

15:47.422 --> 15:50.265
Yeah, Timmy Nation is the head of special collections there.

15:50.245 --> 16:05.867
Yes, I think the Bancroft definitely has money.

16:05.887 --> 16:07.950
They've just required this huge

16:08.217 --> 16:10.159
Mexican Inquisition.

16:10.740 --> 16:13.142
Yes, we're the friends of the Mancroft and people.

16:13.543 --> 16:15.505
They've got a lot of support, actually, at Berkeley.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.286
They are buying.

16:16.546 --> 16:19.389
So there is interest in the artifacts?

16:19.429 --> 16:20.951
Much more than anything else.

16:20.971 --> 16:24.095
I mean, we're the dog and pony show.

16:24.195 --> 16:31.823
I mean, if you bring anybody who's a donor, you bring them to the conservation club and they look at rare materials.

16:32.264 --> 16:32.484
It's fancy.

16:32.504 --> 16:32.864
It's glitzy.

16:32.884 --> 16:33.465
We know that.

16:33.445 --> 16:35.147
You know, like that letter they showed you.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.669
What did they show you for the letter, right?

16:36.709 --> 16:38.331
Of course, a beautiful little letter.

16:38.351 --> 16:39.173
Yeah, see, they'll do that.

16:39.213 --> 16:42.217
Think of your Isaac Newton... Isaac Newton, yes.

16:42.317 --> 16:47.744
Isaac Newton's copy of Henry Moore's book on Daniel.

16:48.104 --> 16:51.749
I mean, that's... Well, this is the real thing, you know.

16:51.769 --> 16:58.558
But I mean, as a historian, I... It's the deformation of the historian, but...

16:58.910 --> 17:04.735
What's interesting is the hype is so ill-informed in many ways.

17:04.915 --> 17:08.738
There are so many shibboleths that you'd have to fire out of the book.

17:08.758 --> 17:21.189
So as a historian, sitting here in East Bay, you also have that situation going on in San Francisco.

17:21.209 --> 17:24.792
Do you have any thoughts of sitting back and looking at both?

17:24.912 --> 17:27.955
I mean, is it an interesting Jefferson position?

17:27.935 --> 17:41.737
The way we framed it in Resisting to Virtual Life is that what you're faced with in Besser agrees with this, I think, is that this is part of the continuing enclosures.

17:41.757 --> 17:51.192
I mean, if you can... I mean, I'm using it as a sort of metaphor from the 18th century, the dispossession of people from the comments.

17:51.627 --> 17:56.978
I mean, the enclosure of information into a... They won't pay per, why wouldn't they?

17:56.998 --> 17:59.343
Every time you pay for every hit, you know?

17:59.443 --> 18:05.416
I mean, there's an enormous amount of money to be made on this, so, you know... Not by the author, though.

18:05.777 --> 18:08.843
No, no, no, the author is being...

18:09.599 --> 18:12.502
is being, you know, disempowered.

18:13.223 --> 18:18.209
I'm not happy that they post chapters of my book on the internet.

18:18.309 --> 18:18.509
No.

18:19.491 --> 18:23.115
I'm losing royalty every time.

18:23.175 --> 18:25.978
Yeah, yeah, of course.

18:25.998 --> 18:28.521
There is a, what's the name of it?

18:28.561 --> 18:31.725
I remember I was trying to reach it and get it in Peppers.

18:32.279 --> 18:40.014
There's a new book on the history of copyright by a critical scholar.

18:40.034 --> 18:40.755
What's the name of the guy?

18:40.775 --> 18:43.039
I don't know the name of the guy.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.284
Of course, people are now interested in copyright.

18:45.684 --> 18:49.191
There's a new thing happening, but there's one that's...

18:49.424 --> 19:03.401
that takes a critical... You see a lot of 19th century stuff and early 20th up until, you know, the stuff is still in copyright.

19:03.842 --> 19:08.468
And then, you know, they're really only digitizing stuff that's public domain.

19:08.608 --> 19:12.833
There are problems to be resolved with

19:12.813 --> 19:19.600
getting permission to scan copyrighted material.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.263
So that is a continuing problem.

19:22.283 --> 19:23.344
Do you resist the work?

19:23.504 --> 19:27.048
Well, I haven't had enough really yet to read the book.

19:27.308 --> 19:30.091
I'll get it when I can make a sentence, but I couldn't write it.

19:31.072 --> 19:32.493
Yes, yes, of course.

19:32.553 --> 19:38.179
And resisting it in the sense that...

19:38.800 --> 19:48.215
Oh, first of all, it's... So you take a position beyond, obviously, reporting, being a historian of... Oh, yeah, absolutely.

19:48.235 --> 20:00.213
I mean, I do it out of a commitment to a more radical deepening of democracy, which digitalization is certainly not about.

20:00.334 --> 20:03.118
In fact, it's precisely about enclosure.

20:03.499 --> 20:04.420
So, I mean...

20:04.670 --> 20:11.780
It's about... Discussion of the computer in the abstract is meaningless.

20:11.820 --> 20:21.174
It's completely different if you have an artisanal relationship to it, like you do or I do, maybe, than if you're chained to it as a data entry neo-slave.

20:22.696 --> 20:32.310
You know, I mean, our bank checks are entered in the Virgin Islands each night by people who can't get up to take a pee, you know, and who are getting digital palsy every night.

20:32.370 --> 20:33.772
I mean, that's entirely different.

20:33.812 --> 20:34.052
So...

20:34.218 --> 20:46.665
What all technologies are about is, you know, they're all historically, as Chuck Marks said, you know, they're all, you know, weapons in the class war, potentially.

20:46.685 --> 20:51.295
And so, you know, it doesn't, it makes no sense to ask, you know, is the computer good or bad?

20:51.455 --> 20:53.880
I mean, because it's all, all technologies are...

20:54.434 --> 21:00.065
It's always inserted into already existing sets of social relations.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.149
The book's not going to die.

21:02.169 --> 21:04.252
It's ridiculous.

21:04.273 --> 21:07.198
Well, I didn't interview David Bradbury at the British Library.

21:07.238 --> 21:11.987
It cost a billion pounds to build the British Library.

21:11.967 --> 21:20.601
And he said, you know, if we were to digitize every page, we figured it out, it would cost 50 billion pounds.

21:21.503 --> 21:25.750
And labor, the cost of labor is not going to, you know, and the biggest action is labor, it's not technology.

21:26.210 --> 21:31.579
So trust me, the book's not going to disappear for a long, long, long time, you know.

21:31.559 --> 21:41.518
And they are books that need updating regularly, reference books.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.941
Maybe that's not so bad.

21:42.961 --> 21:44.964
Maybe it's not so bad, exactly.

21:44.984 --> 21:51.677
And maybe one can read the newspaper online, you know, things that are a little more ephemeral, you know, we have a little less of...

21:51.657 --> 21:53.581
You know, paper wasted, maybe.

21:53.641 --> 21:54.964
I mean, maybe it's not so bad.

21:55.124 --> 21:57.068
I don't want to get rid of my newspaper.

21:57.268 --> 21:58.150
Well, all right.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.858
But I do think that things that get updated are good.

22:01.878 --> 22:03.942
The OED, maybe it's better.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.305
I think so.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.489
I really believe that.

22:07.469 --> 22:10.113
We haven't been constantly being changed.

22:10.373 --> 22:19.225
Our monographs that cost you 150 bucks, and they're only issued in a thousand copies of that many, and it's obsolete today.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.228
So maybe stuff like that?

22:21.268 --> 22:21.789
I think so.

22:21.869 --> 22:28.178
If it can do that, and if it can make it more readily accessible at that level in public libraries, it's worthwhile.

22:28.158 --> 22:36.369
Do you have any take on deaccessioning things, getting rid of things, and less coffee situations?

22:36.710 --> 22:39.013
Well, it happens in every library.

22:39.113 --> 22:39.474
Over here?

22:40.134 --> 22:41.256
Well, what happens?

22:41.276 --> 22:48.546
Well, what happens in libraries is it goes into the gift shop, mostly, and then people come and buy it, and if they don't buy it, it gets dumped.

22:48.526 --> 22:51.051
They dump it.

22:51.111 --> 22:54.717
Oh, you know, I honestly don't know that because I'm not a librarian.

22:55.118 --> 22:56.961
Well, people in acquisitions, you know.

22:57.883 --> 23:00.708
Maybe you could ask Barclay, actually, who you would talk to.

23:00.728 --> 23:01.710
He would know that.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.233
I'm trying to think about that.

23:03.273 --> 23:05.537
I could find out for you if you don't have any luck with him.

23:05.597 --> 23:06.458
I'll find out for you.

23:06.478 --> 23:07.741
Because there'll be policies.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.304
I mean, they'll be written down somewhere.

23:09.364 --> 23:10.686
I could get you a copy of those.

23:10.666 --> 23:19.386
But, I mean, if a book hasn't been read in two or three or four or five years, you think that there is a candidate for... No, we have curators look at them.

23:19.667 --> 23:22.453
We have curators of all subject matters come and look at them.

23:22.493 --> 23:26.262
We don't have people who don't, you know, who just...

23:26.242 --> 23:32.372
are in acquisitions or circulation saying, oh, this book has... No, I mean, I have books through my hands that haven't been read since 1930.

23:32.813 --> 23:33.835
They've never been touched.

23:34.255 --> 23:37.381
And yet, you know, somebody takes it out and it falls apart.

23:37.401 --> 23:39.163
So I go, oh, this needs mending.

23:39.404 --> 23:40.185
That's really my work.

23:40.205 --> 23:41.888
But I don't say it wouldn't happen.

23:42.307 --> 23:47.011
I mean, you can imagine that that will be a criterion, right?

23:47.271 --> 23:48.112
What will be?

23:48.152 --> 23:50.914
Well, if it's not been consulted in 50 years.

23:51.075 --> 23:52.356
Not in the research level.

23:52.376 --> 23:58.561
Well, not in the research level, but I know at the University of Michigan, they were thinking, what, five years?

23:58.581 --> 23:58.681
Yeah.

23:58.701 --> 24:01.624
You know, what hasn't been used in five years?

24:02.645 --> 24:06.368
Does an argument have to be made about keeping it?

24:06.508 --> 24:12.313
I'll talk to that question, because he is so much into use, you know, because our whole program is,

24:12.293 --> 24:16.521
based on use, so that we only deal with the books that have been used.

24:16.541 --> 24:26.038
And I know that's slightly for... I'm talking about, no, circulating and special collections.

24:26.058 --> 24:31.348
And even one use, there's a formula where he thinks it will have more use.

24:31.649 --> 24:34.273
No use, it can stay on the shelf.

24:34.293 --> 24:38.220
One use, then you look at it, you know, and you respond to it.

24:38.620 --> 24:43.128
I think this has to do with triage on, you know, the sort of cost-benefit.

24:44.730 --> 24:48.697
This is, I think, the real difference in modernity.

24:48.857 --> 24:51.682
I mean, late modernity is about triage.

24:51.822 --> 24:53.304
It's all about cost-benefit.

24:53.705 --> 24:55.007
That's a great quote.

24:55.578 --> 25:00.286
No, its cost-benefit analysis has taken over almost all disciplines.

25:02.010 --> 25:02.090
Yes.

25:02.110 --> 25:09.683
No, it's not just medicine and environmental health, but it's precisely... I mean, this is why Barclay's thinking, well, how many times is it going to be used?

25:09.703 --> 25:19.982
In other words, is Jill going to disbind it and put it in a new... It's going to be 200 hours of work, or do you just put it in a phase box?

25:20.519 --> 25:25.765
And, you know, because it's only going to be picked up twice in 50 years.

25:26.105 --> 25:32.172
And I think in a way that makes sense.

25:32.192 --> 25:39.019
I mean, I think that in a way that makes sense.

25:39.039 --> 25:47.168
So it's one of the reasons I've got interested in the politics of risk, because it's very, very of risk.

25:47.823 --> 26:05.292
I have a small essay on risk which I should give you, which lays out

26:05.272 --> 26:15.051
this shift in world view, which is at the heart of conservation as well as it is ever, you know, there's a dozen... I've got some cards in my car across the street.

26:15.131 --> 26:18.658
I happen to be parked right over there, so I'll give you my card.

26:18.699 --> 26:20.021
Yeah, you should.

26:20.041 --> 26:20.883
I have to go in a minute.

26:20.963 --> 26:21.765
All right, okay.

26:22.426 --> 26:26.554
When do you think would be my best time to try Barclay?

26:26.787 --> 26:28.049
I think we should try now.

26:28.069 --> 26:28.830
He's there all day.

26:28.950 --> 26:31.173
I think we should just try him and set up an appointment.

26:31.654 --> 26:33.617
He would rather you called him, I know that.

26:33.717 --> 26:34.778
He has lots of meetings.

26:34.798 --> 26:40.707
But I think you should ask him about use, too.

26:40.787 --> 26:44.672
Ask Barclay about use and risk of the collections.

26:44.852 --> 26:45.353
Use?

26:45.856 --> 26:53.491
And how he's devised his program, on what basis, you know.

26:53.511 --> 26:57.720
He should be interested in, I've had a long interview with Ken Carpenter at Harvard.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.305
This chapter, I'm going to have a chapter on this.

27:00.525 --> 27:01.828
Let's do that again.

27:01.888 --> 27:05.856
Every copy of Mark Twain gets looked at and analyzed and itemized and

27:05.836 --> 27:08.642
Oh, there were so many points, that's right, there were so many issues.

27:08.962 --> 27:09.523
Every time.

27:09.563 --> 27:10.906
Where is the Mark Twain?

27:10.926 --> 27:19.263
Mark Twain's upstairs in the Bancroft, and I'm trying to think, Robert Hurst, H-A-R-S-T, H-I-R-S-T, Hurst.

27:19.323 --> 27:22.730
What's the name of the librarian that, I know I've met him?

27:22.750 --> 27:25.515
The rare book librarian, Tony Bliss, Anthony Bliss.

27:26.575 --> 27:28.898
I mean, the Bancroft?

27:28.918 --> 27:31.521
Oh, Charles Fulhaver is the head of the Bancroft.

27:31.541 --> 27:34.564
I know I met a gentleman last year at the ILAB.

27:34.644 --> 27:35.946
Peter Hempf?

27:35.986 --> 27:40.791
Peter Hempf was running it for a while.

27:41.051 --> 27:41.692
That's right.

27:41.752 --> 27:44.035
I know Peter, but who does Peter work for?

27:44.175 --> 27:45.016
Charles Fulhaver.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.919
He's got a mustache, a slight fellow.

27:47.939 --> 27:48.399
He's new.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.501
He's only been there a year.

27:50.181 --> 27:51.403
I met him just about a year ago.

27:51.443 --> 27:52.424
Yeah, that's probably right then.

27:52.444 --> 27:53.345
What's his name again?

27:53.565 --> 27:54.767
Charles Fulhaver.

27:55.047 --> 27:56.008
Charles, that's he.

27:56.528 --> 27:57.749
He's the fellow that told me.

27:58.710 --> 28:04.897
He's not bothered by the thought of having books leave the libraries.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.840
And he said that to me on tape last year.

28:07.860 --> 28:08.281
Charles?

28:08.521 --> 28:09.362
I'm not surprised.

28:10.143 --> 28:13.326
F-A-U-L-H-A-B-E-R.

28:14.007 --> 28:15.909
Do you have his number here?

28:16.150 --> 28:16.710
No.

28:16.830 --> 28:20.074
Actually, it might not.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.818
Okay, you can get him through...

28:24.068 --> 28:26.811
His number is 642... 3773.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.635
3773.

28:29.655 --> 28:32.879
Yeah, that's the main Bancroft number.

28:32.899 --> 28:34.341
I'm going to go make some calls.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.182
That's five women.

28:35.362 --> 28:38.867
Okay, thank you.

28:38.887 --> 28:43.012
Yes, and Barkley, I realize now, now I think about it, he's in a meeting till 11.

28:43.232 --> 28:46.416
Okay, I'm going to go... My boss has gone upstairs, so she'll be in a meeting.

28:46.436 --> 28:49.180
And you have to go... Well, she's not going back till 11, but I do.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.742
Okay, great.

28:50.762 --> 28:51.322
I do.

28:51.342 --> 28:52.203
Okay.

28:52.223 --> 28:53.485
I'm meeting with Paul...

28:53.667 --> 28:58.274
You go there at noon, and he said, you'll tell me how to get there.

28:58.595 --> 29:00.017
Yeah, yeah, he's good.

29:00.037 --> 29:01.460
It's right now from here.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.601
We're meeting at a restaurant.

29:02.621 --> 29:04.324
I'm interviewing at 3 p.m.

29:04.344 --> 29:05.226
today.

29:05.246 --> 29:06.087
Questions?

29:06.107 --> 29:07.089
About a library.

29:07.109 --> 29:11.836
Why does he have to say there are 10 white women whose librarians are up?

29:12.077 --> 29:19.028
I mean, this concept of the affinity groups, all this empty space.

29:19.128 --> 29:20.150
What do you think of that library?

29:20.170 --> 29:20.991
Do you have an opinion?

29:21.393 --> 29:24.376
that you cared to be quoted on at San Francisco Libraries.

29:25.817 --> 29:27.619
And I've been to the French Library now.

29:27.639 --> 29:28.520
That's a statement.

29:28.540 --> 29:30.843
They admit this is a cultural statement that they're making.

29:30.863 --> 29:37.069
It may not be very book-friendly and library-friendly, but they were making a cultural national statement.

29:37.089 --> 29:39.812
I wonder what the health statement is they're making at the census.

29:39.832 --> 29:41.894
I think it's a personal statement for someone.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.595
I don't think it's a statement to reflect.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.997
But do you know which person that is?

29:45.017 --> 29:47.299
Well, the guys who organized the... It's a corporate library.

29:47.319 --> 29:51.163
I think they jumped on the fact that there was this enormous...

29:51.802 --> 30:05.423
general goodwill by the people of the bay area san francisco who can be against libraries it's the last public it's the last commons you know it's all that we have it's a tremendously powerful

30:05.892 --> 30:28.187
metaphor for our lost common life you know the public library so there's an enormous fund of goodwill and uh this bond measure i mean listening to 78 fantastic amount of money and and there was a number of unscrupulous people who um but what were they trying to accomplish what were they trying to build do you think in their monument

30:28.572 --> 30:29.934
Well, I don't know.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.657
I mean, I think that obviously it's the crucible.

30:32.677 --> 30:34.039
There's a number of forces at work.

30:34.079 --> 30:56.487
I mean, I agree with Gray on this, that he, Gray Breton, right, that probably there's been malfeasance, you know, that there are people that there's conflict of interest, and that it's a kind of... If you talk about, if you get this tremendous public support, you get the money,

30:56.703 --> 30:58.726
You get the mandate to build a library.

30:59.386 --> 31:00.868
Why don't you just build a library?

31:01.449 --> 31:03.191
What would the agenda be?

31:03.252 --> 31:06.476
Why would you want to do something that's not a repository of books?

31:07.277 --> 31:08.659
Why would you dump books?

31:08.679 --> 31:12.644
Why would you build a place with all this open, unusable space?

31:12.664 --> 31:16.269
You know, have parties and do all this other stuff.

31:16.409 --> 31:20.274
Is it, in fact, a commitment to the computerized library?

31:20.314 --> 31:20.935
I mean, I don't know.

31:21.435 --> 31:22.076
Is that what it is?

31:22.096 --> 31:23.198
I think that's part of what it is.

31:23.238 --> 31:26.642
You're going to have to... I mean, that's why you... I mean, you need to...

31:26.842 --> 31:27.823
I'm going to ask you that.

31:27.864 --> 31:37.017
The obvious question is, how does Coltrick become qualified to be the president of the Libraries Commission?

31:37.037 --> 31:39.921
He doesn't have a library card, and I've already found that out.

31:41.103 --> 31:44.188
He's never taken a book out of the San Francisco Public Library.

31:44.268 --> 31:45.670
I'm not going to be that direct.

31:45.690 --> 31:47.172
He doesn't need to.

31:47.232 --> 31:50.537
Just ask him what kinds of books he'd like to read.

31:50.557 --> 31:52.340
Ask him what his library's like.

31:52.921 --> 31:54.183
How books are relevant to him?

31:54.263 --> 31:55.144
I don't know.

31:55.343 --> 31:56.585
I've never seen anything like this.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.367
Have you ever seen anything like it?

31:58.968 --> 32:05.878
No, it's a horrendous example, I think, of what, you know, I mean, it's a wake-up call.

32:05.919 --> 32:14.651
I think that's why it's a very good, it's a very, very good case study.

32:15.833 --> 32:16.654
That's why I'm here.

32:18.637 --> 32:19.879
That's why I'm here.

32:19.899 --> 32:21.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:22.816 --> 32:26.721
And I don't want to be quoted on this, actually, this one, because James Chafee... Say that.

32:26.801 --> 32:27.041
Yeah.

32:27.361 --> 32:29.444
I wanted to say something like that.

32:29.624 --> 32:30.405
Except in the beginning.

32:31.026 --> 32:33.468
You had James Chafee, who I'm seeing, by the way.

32:33.789 --> 32:34.189
Yeah.

32:34.830 --> 32:38.955
You indicated that he wrote a piece for this book, Resisting the Virtual Life.

32:39.315 --> 32:40.056
Yeah, yeah.

32:40.236 --> 32:52.030
James submitted a piece for Resisting the Virtual Life, which, you know, made claims that there was...

32:52.668 --> 33:17.157
uh terrible things going on at the san francisco public library which we were interested in anyway as a case study but we had no idea uh that he was so on the mark and so early i mean he was there you know years before anyone else he was trying to raise a and he had a newsletter which uh sounded hysterical that's what i said i said you understand

33:17.542 --> 33:21.469
And he said to me, you know, you're probably going to think I'm crazy.

33:21.489 --> 33:23.833
And I said, well, I don't know.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.656
I don't want to ask you what I think.

33:25.676 --> 33:27.198
It's what other people think.

33:27.218 --> 33:28.661
You know, I'm just coming out to report it.

33:28.761 --> 33:33.569
And I said, well, what is your, why are you so intensely involved?

33:33.629 --> 33:35.352
And he said, I'm a library person.

33:35.372 --> 33:38.137
And, you know, they've stolen my library.

33:38.197 --> 33:40.601
And, you know, I'll talk to him.

33:40.661 --> 33:41.342
You have to learn.

33:41.362 --> 33:41.963
So.

33:42.601 --> 33:43.363
We'll chat.

33:43.864 --> 33:44.606
Thank you so much.

33:45.669 --> 33:48.516
And what's your... I've got to... What's it now?

33:48.616 --> 33:49.879
It's 10 minutes to 11.

33:49.899 --> 33:51.443
Oh, I can go for another 10 minutes.

33:51.463 --> 33:52.044
Okay, good.

33:52.205 --> 33:53.588
And then I can make a full pass.

33:53.608 --> 33:53.889
Thanks.

33:54.009 --> 33:54.531
Bye-bye, John.

33:55.974 --> 33:57.137
Let me give you this back.

33:58.099 --> 33:59.563
This is now...

33:59.712 --> 34:05.598
Now we've had coffee now.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.861
I can call you and we can have a conversation.

34:07.881 --> 34:08.962
Yes, of course.

34:09.002 --> 34:11.965
I look at this as an opening shot.

34:12.185 --> 34:13.426
The telephone.

34:13.486 --> 34:14.628
Let me transcribe this.

34:14.688 --> 34:16.009
Let me read this.

34:16.069 --> 34:20.214
Let me talk to a few more people.

34:20.254 --> 34:20.974
Now we begin.

34:21.074 --> 34:24.658
At the end, we can do the whole thing.

34:24.678 --> 34:29.263
The extent to which I might be useful is as

34:30.526 --> 34:36.133
is as a sort of historian's voice on technology.

34:36.734 --> 34:39.957
I want to see Tilly Olsen tomorrow, who will be wonderful.

34:39.977 --> 34:44.683
She's a writer and a library user, a person who's totally formed by public libraries.

34:45.224 --> 34:56.097
She has no axe to grind other than the fact that libraries are places where you go to commune with the past and the heritage and the history, and they're throwing our books away, she says.

34:56.798 --> 34:58.660
And she's a pretty eloquent voice.

34:58.910 --> 34:59.491
for that.

35:00.271 --> 35:01.893
You're a historian.

35:03.374 --> 35:07.058
Give me a little biographical background.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.621
I'm originally from Ireland, from Ulster.

35:11.963 --> 35:14.665
My family are Northern Protestants.

35:15.786 --> 35:19.470
But I was sent away to school in England from the age of six.

35:21.172 --> 35:22.673
I had a sort of classical education.

35:22.773 --> 35:24.154
I was a recovering classicist.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.757
At where?

35:27.361 --> 35:33.229
I was at Shontland College and then I went to Oxford and Cambridge.

35:33.249 --> 35:46.646
And I got interested in... And I eventually became a kind of a historian of science and technology, but with a detour through linguistics.

35:47.547 --> 35:54.516
And I focused in my work on linguistics on the emergence of...

35:55.340 --> 35:56.943
post-war linguistics.

35:58.426 --> 36:19.103
I was interested because of my political views in Noam Chomsky, and I was interested in how it was that he came to have his theory of language, his unusual view of language, and its relationship to

36:19.859 --> 36:27.751
the sort of industrial complex and the scientific military complex in Boston.

36:27.771 --> 36:35.703
Because he first went to work on... His first job was on a machine translation project.

36:36.444 --> 36:40.951
Well, an artificial intelligence project, in fact, in the mid-50s.

36:41.452 --> 36:42.694
That's pretty great.

36:43.515 --> 36:46.319
That's very well chronicled, isn't it?

36:46.339 --> 36:46.980
At MIT.

36:48.125 --> 37:10.921
Although he says that he never believed in the hype around that particular project, which was really an attempt to pull down Russian broadcasts and to get a computer translation and then do a human post-editing.

37:12.403 --> 37:16.309
It was kind of a bizarre project.

37:17.723 --> 37:21.307
But that's what took me to the whole Boston milieu.

37:23.009 --> 37:26.793
So you're familiar with my neck of the woods?

37:27.054 --> 37:29.196
I worked at Harvard for three years.

37:29.216 --> 37:33.141
I was in the History of Science Department when I first got to the States.

37:33.161 --> 37:42.391
And Jill was recruited from Britain to go and work at the New England Conservation Center.

37:42.632 --> 37:42.972
So you met Jill?

37:43.188 --> 37:45.090
I came, I followed Jill.

37:45.110 --> 37:46.831
Jill was recruited to work in the States.

37:46.951 --> 37:57.721
I came to North America not because I particularly like it here, although I don't particularly like it anywhere, but I think the world is in a bad state.

37:59.103 --> 38:02.666
But so we went to Boston and we lived in Cambridge, yes.

38:03.227 --> 38:06.189
And so I'm quite familiar with Widener.

38:07.130 --> 38:11.174
And she trained in a very old-fashioned way.

38:11.294 --> 38:12.435
I mean, she...

38:12.635 --> 38:20.285
Her boss was Sandy Cockrell, whose father was apprentice to Colton Sanderson and William Morris.

38:20.325 --> 38:24.090
So Jill actually has some of Morris's old tools and things.

38:24.231 --> 38:38.530
So she is an old school bookbinder conservator who is watching, fascinated, the destruction of the libraries.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.212
How about a conservative?

38:40.698 --> 38:41.759
greater length.

38:41.779 --> 39:09.068
Yeah, it's very interesting to see her take on and for her to watch Bartley Ogden, you know, who himself trained, I think, at the Newbury, you know, have to more or less enthusiastically get into the sort of the politics of the book and conservation and deal with the

39:09.858 --> 39:16.765
this astounding situation in libraries where... Yeah.

39:17.145 --> 39:20.429
Well, I'm just sort of... I love the politics of the book.

39:20.449 --> 39:21.270
Yes.

39:21.490 --> 39:21.810
Yes.

39:22.231 --> 39:25.994
I mean, it's absolutely riveting to watch Barclay.

39:26.035 --> 39:27.416
I mean, I don't know.

39:27.456 --> 39:37.266
You could find out maybe how much Barclay still has, you know, that sort of cathexis

39:37.583 --> 39:39.686
of the actual artifact that... Have what?

39:39.866 --> 39:40.426
What was that word again?

39:40.487 --> 39:41.288
Sort of cathexis.

39:41.368 --> 39:44.471
You know, the kind of... Well, it's a Freudian term.

39:44.612 --> 39:46.274
How do you spell it?

39:46.554 --> 39:48.116
C-A-T-H-E-X-I-S.

39:48.196 --> 39:52.081
It's the kind of... It's what book lovers have.

39:52.101 --> 39:56.466
You know, that kind of... The mania for... Well, that might be a chapter title.

39:56.526 --> 39:58.008
Cathexis, yeah.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.229
It's a good word.

39:59.250 --> 39:59.730
Yeah.

39:59.750 --> 40:00.731
To cathex something.

40:00.751 --> 40:05.397
It's when you... It implies a kind of...

40:05.900 --> 40:11.671
more than an emotional investment, but that's somehow like physical, you know.

40:12.573 --> 40:17.683
It's an investment in the touch and feel.

40:18.003 --> 40:18.905
It's a Freudian term.

40:18.925 --> 40:21.049
It's used in Freudian theory.

40:21.189 --> 40:23.534
You cathect various objects.

40:23.554 --> 40:26.760
If you're talking about, yeah, to cathect, yeah.

40:27.668 --> 40:29.350
And cathexis is the noun.

40:29.591 --> 40:40.004
And, I mean, it's the relation you have to particular kinds of book thieves and bibliophiles and those of us who love books desperately.

40:41.066 --> 40:42.508
Those of us who love books.

40:42.528 --> 40:46.553
I mean, you can cathect, of course, cars and breasts.

40:46.673 --> 40:51.700
Yes, exactly.

40:51.720 --> 40:55.785
But, yeah, I mean, God, what is the culture of consumption if not...

40:56.288 --> 41:18.043
just a series of uh you know but i mean barclay i don't know whether he i mean he loves books too but he's had to he's i think he's interesting like besser would be because you know these are people with feet in in both camps in a way

41:18.327 --> 41:20.090
I've got that point where I'm thinking.

41:20.150 --> 41:22.733
I see things that make nice chapter panels too, you know.

41:23.995 --> 41:25.517
In both camps.

41:25.758 --> 41:26.599
In both camps.

41:26.619 --> 41:27.881
You know, he's on the cusp.

41:27.961 --> 41:33.529
And whether books... Which way is it... I mean, of course it's up for grabs.

41:33.649 --> 41:46.528
I mean, that's why I think that, you know, Gray and... Nick Baker and Gray, when that famous meeting where they gave these unbelievably powerful speeches in the belly of the beast of the new library...

41:47.285 --> 42:16.043
Um, you know, it was the first time for me and I realized, you know, how much was at stake, you know, that actually San Francisco was, you know, this was a site of struggle and it was terribly important because the scope of the malfeasance and the, you know, what was going on and the, uh, it was the first time I'd heard fully about, you know, Brooks Hall, you know, and this, these miles of

42:16.664 --> 42:18.908
I'm going down there.

42:19.028 --> 42:21.312
I'm demanding it.

42:21.813 --> 42:23.376
I'm not even going to.

42:23.777 --> 42:27.002
I've stuck in all kinds of places in my life.

42:27.383 --> 42:29.467
I don't think it would be hard.

42:29.487 --> 42:31.270
And if necessary, I'll do it.

42:32.192 --> 42:33.935
But I'm asking straight away.

42:33.955 --> 42:34.656
I want to see it.

42:34.973 --> 42:36.356
Why can't I see it?

42:36.376 --> 42:36.957
Exactly.

42:37.078 --> 42:39.262
I mean, television cameras have been down there.

42:39.282 --> 42:40.585
I'm writing a goddamn book.

42:40.746 --> 42:43.131
Yes, exactly.

42:43.211 --> 42:44.233
This is for all time.

42:44.253 --> 42:45.356
I mean, I want to go see it.

42:45.376 --> 42:48.402
I want to see what you're doing with these collections.

42:48.422 --> 42:48.583
Yes.

42:48.783 --> 42:51.108
We'll see, won't we?

42:51.309 --> 42:51.970
So...

42:52.996 --> 42:56.881
Do you have anything formal to do with the university?

42:57.021 --> 42:57.342
I do.

42:57.462 --> 42:59.484
Actually, I work in that building there.

42:59.725 --> 43:01.427
It's the geography department.

43:01.547 --> 43:04.451
I work in the geography department as a historian.

43:04.611 --> 43:08.275
So the university hires historians?

43:08.576 --> 43:11.840
Do you write history or do you teach it?

43:11.920 --> 43:12.901
To teach it, yeah.

43:12.921 --> 43:13.762
Oh, so you're a teacher.

43:13.782 --> 43:14.423
I teach.

43:15.224 --> 43:17.868
I teach in the geography department, yeah.

43:17.888 --> 43:21.212
That's great.

43:21.232 --> 43:22.834
Yeah, and so I do...

43:23.202 --> 43:28.794
the history of geography, the history of science, environmental history.

43:28.894 --> 43:38.916
My courses are on these big surveys on nature and culture.

43:39.368 --> 43:42.254
Yes, it does.

43:42.655 --> 43:46.243
Yes, exactly.

43:46.704 --> 43:52.197
This one, I don't know.

43:52.317 --> 43:53.439
This is a very small one.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.945
Yeah, it may be.

43:56.185 --> 43:59.132
It may be.

43:59.517 --> 44:04.924
They have it on Cody's.

44:05.044 --> 44:06.726
Have you been to Cody's, the big bookstore?

44:07.347 --> 44:11.412
There's two serious bookstores in Berkeley, just on the south side of the campus.

44:11.752 --> 44:14.956
I've got to be back in this town, so I couldn't let it come back.

44:15.016 --> 44:15.797
I've got it.

44:15.817 --> 44:17.139
I've got it, for sure.

44:17.239 --> 44:18.821
Yeah, I mean, it's around.

44:19.061 --> 44:23.026
I can't say which particular.

44:23.707 --> 44:25.429
No, you'll be able to pick it up.

44:25.489 --> 44:27.611
I'm sorry I don't have any more copies for me.

44:27.792 --> 44:28.933
No to worry.

44:28.913 --> 44:30.638
I'm supposed to meet Paul.
