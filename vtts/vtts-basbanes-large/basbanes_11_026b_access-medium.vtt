The black number of lines, you're very alike, you're very certain on the board.

All right.

31:32.292 --> 31:53.507
We'll be right back.

31:53.487 --> 32:16.660
You okay?

32:16.640 --> 32:38.640
Oh, it's, it's, it's, if you see any catalog, it's on a honeymoon right here.

32:38.660 --> 32:39.542
This is gentlemen, you know, this is Russia.

32:39.522 --> 32:52.960
This is very, I just like to try to get out of the window.

32:52.980 --> 32:53.421
I'm a little obsessed.

32:53.441 --> 32:53.982
This is a very extra table.

32:54.003 --> 32:54.544
Very, that's a great color.

32:54.524 --> 33:14.423
Thank you.

33:14.403 --> 33:32.995
And he was going through that much of a problem.

33:33.015 --> 33:34.237
He made him a situation that made him sound, whatever it was.

33:34.257 --> 33:34.938
He was fighting about the silence.

33:34.958 --> 33:36.040
He was low with whatever he had to write for 20 years.

33:36.020 --> 33:55.699
Thank you.

33:55.679 --> 34:19.999
Thank you.

34:19.979 --> 34:49.986

34:49.966 --> 35:05.241
I don't have a book at one point in time.

35:07.634 --> 35:31.988
I love that.

35:31.968 --> 35:55.393
Oh, I know it's not really good for you.

35:55.373 --> 36:11.847
Normally, I wouldn't have been there, but I think it would look like a story in the New Yorker as well.

36:11.827 --> 36:37.995
.

36:38.015 --> 36:38.035
.

36:38.055 --> 36:38.075

Thank you.

39:28.471 --> 39:53.771
You remember me?

39:53.791 --> 39:54.512
I had this huge interview with them.

39:54.847 --> 40:09.868
... ... ...

40:09.848 --> 40:32.650
I don't know.

40:32.630 --> 40:54.992
Oh, my God.

40:54.972 --> 41:16.225

42:45.773 --> 42:45.793

42:45.773 --> 43:15.763
Come on.

All right.

43:45.173 --> 44:07.439
.

44:07.459 --> 44:07.479
.

44:07.499 --> 44:07.519

Oh, my God.

44:29.707 --> 44:59.713
Thank you.

44:59.693 --> 45:15.120
Oh, God.

45:15.100 --> 45:41.157
.

45:41.177 --> 45:41.197
.

45:41.217 --> 45:41.237
.

45:41.257 --> 45:41.277
.

45:41.257 --> 45:56.582
I can't even tell you how to do it.

45:56.562 --> 46:23.026
It's very interesting, that's what I say.

46:23.046 --> 46:23.767
Now I'm in the library, the library.

46:23.787 --> 46:25.188
And the story that goes in, well, that's what you're here.

46:25.208 --> 46:26.029
There's a better story than when you are.

46:26.009 --> 46:53.805
... ... ... ... ...

46:53.785 --> 47:08.528
But there's something else in the business of Hawaii.

47:08.548 --> 47:10.492
When it's in Hawaii, the Hawaiian, the Hawaiian, the guys who go in the air when it's on the air.

47:10.512 --> 47:12.375
You get a place to the house, you get a place to have it, Hawaii, and the Arab, and over 120.

47:12.395 --> 47:13.156
And that's how it's in Hawaii, Hawaii.

47:13.176 --> 47:13.937
And what is the first time in the air?

47:13.917 --> 47:39.691
Six mucs called Lions Spare.

47:39.711 --> 47:40.091
No lions and gates.

47:40.111 --> 47:40.372
What is that?

47:40.392 --> 47:40.752
Is it an open cup?

47:40.732 --> 47:59.061
It's going to be a really good time to have a window.

47:59.041 --> 48:20.372
.

48:20.392 --> 48:20.412
.

48:20.432 --> 48:20.452
.

48:20.472 --> 48:20.492
.

48:20.472 --> 48:43.054
that's a great story

48:43.034 --> 49:05.000
.

49:05.020 --> 49:05.040
.

49:05.060 --> 49:05.080
.

49:05.100 --> 49:05.120
.

49:05.140 --> 49:05.160
.

49:05.140 --> 49:26.298
One guy.

49:26.318 --> 49:26.479
One guy.

49:26.499 --> 49:26.659
One guy.

49:30.790 --> 49:50.917
.

49:50.937 --> 49:50.957
.

49:50.977 --> 49:50.997
.

49:51.017 --> 49:51.037
.

49:51.057 --> 49:51.077
.

49:51.057 --> 50:14.110
And the doctor said, listen, I got a list of the phone.

50:14.130 --> 50:16.033
I got a phone call that he said, and he said, I'm going to look at the case involving the game.

50:16.053 --> 50:16.914
And he said, the phone case about the game.

50:16.934 --> 50:17.395
How long have I had it?

50:17.415 --> 50:17.655
And he goes,

50:17.635 --> 50:45.043
I don't know.

50:45.023 --> 51:00.496
That's different about any of the things that I remember both.

51:00.516 --> 51:01.017
And they're so different.

51:01.037 --> 51:01.458
They're so different.

51:01.478 --> 51:01.899
They're so different.

51:01.919 --> 51:02.340
They're so different.

51:02.320 --> 51:18.355
I was only 15 years old.

51:18.335 --> 51:45.388
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

51:45.368 --> 52:02.948
I found out who he was.

52:02.968 --> 52:03.028
Ha!

52:03.048 --> 52:03.709
He went and escaped in the woods.

52:03.729 --> 52:04.309
He was the lucky to find him.

52:04.329 --> 52:04.610
I can see you.

52:04.630 --> 52:04.910
I can see you.

52:04.930 --> 52:05.210
I can see you.

52:05.230 --> 52:05.511
I can see you.

52:05.531 --> 52:05.811
I can see you.

52:05.831 --> 52:06.111
I can see you.

52:06.131 --> 52:06.412
I can see you.

52:06.432 --> 52:06.712
I can see you.

52:06.732 --> 52:07.012
I can see you.

52:07.032 --> 52:07.313
I can see you.

52:07.333 --> 52:07.613
I can see you.

52:07.593 --> 52:28.476
It's not like the power.

52:28.496 --> 52:28.977
It's not like the power.

52:28.997 --> 52:29.477
It's not like the power.

52:29.497 --> 52:29.978
It's not like the power.

52:29.998 --> 52:30.478
It's not like the power.

52:30.498 --> 52:30.979
It's not like the power.

52:30.999 --> 52:31.479
It's not like the power.

52:31.499 --> 52:31.980
It's not like the power.

52:31.960 --> 52:51.336
... ... ...

52:51.316 --> 53:09.941
It was really good.

53:09.961 --> 53:10.341
It was really good.

53:10.362 --> 53:10.742
It was really good.

53:10.722 --> 53:37.358
.

53:37.378 --> 53:37.398
.

53:37.418 --> 53:37.438
.

53:37.418 --> 54:05.430
And it's not the alternative case, right?

54:05.450 --> 54:06.351
I understandably, that could be a better one.

54:06.371 --> 54:06.531
Hold on.

54:09.025 --> 54:32.290
Michael, his father, and his mother, and the chief of Wichita are involved.

54:32.310 --> 54:33.131
I mean, that's the story of Jonah, right?

54:33.151 --> 54:33.531
His father died.

54:35.705 --> 55:00.077
And he said that people came sent by his son.

55:01.939 --> 55:05.644
I mean, you know,

55:06.417 --> 55:10.000
So Haven said that his father was suffering from severe delusions.

55:10.021 --> 55:12.843
So that's why it was so relevant about when did you leave home?

55:12.883 --> 55:14.044
Why did you change your name?

55:14.845 --> 55:18.269
Did you ever have any contact with your father over the years?

55:18.469 --> 55:20.731
All this stuff became quite relevant.

55:20.751 --> 55:35.125
His father, who was from Western Texas in a ministry, and he was kind of a religious fanatic, not unlike his son, left all of his money to some Bible group out there, to a publishing program for Bibles.

55:35.780 --> 55:39.445
And Haven went and fought this thing tooth and tongue and lost.

55:39.926 --> 55:46.275
Because they could find no... There was no credible evidence that the father was deranged when he changed the world.

55:47.737 --> 55:48.559
Thank God.

55:48.679 --> 56:01.197
I didn't get... If that guy didn't call me, I would be really... I mean, there's no way they could have sued me because my sources were the United States government.

56:02.493 --> 56:11.286
But as it happens, we did have to change one section of the book in the fifth edition, where it quietly took on all references to the military records.

56:11.526 --> 56:14.871
Not because it was wrong, but because it was incomplete.

56:14.891 --> 56:18.437
You know, and that's the only ethical thing to do.

56:18.517 --> 56:29.513
Once you come into possession of information that shows that you don't have the whole story, well, then either you change it and put that information in, which is what I wanted to do.

56:30.016 --> 56:33.320
And the lawyer said, no, no, no, let's just take it out.

56:33.340 --> 56:33.921
That's fine.

56:34.121 --> 56:34.742
I took that out.

56:35.683 --> 56:43.833
So no longer do we have him being discharged for bed wetting out of there.

56:43.853 --> 56:45.375
I can't tell that story yet.

56:45.395 --> 56:46.437
Do me a favor.

56:46.457 --> 56:47.578
Keep that story.

56:47.598 --> 56:57.070
Oh, I think when this guy dies,

56:57.775 --> 57:04.804
I don't even know if I want to wait that long.

57:04.884 --> 57:17.399
I mean, to me, I owe my readers because he's a food plant.

57:17.419 --> 57:24.188
And yet, on the other hand, he had an extraordinary package and a feel for books.

57:24.268 --> 57:26.010
But everywhere I went in Europe,

57:27.323 --> 57:37.238
really wonderful booksellers like Pia Merez, Karen Burt, Tencher, do these names?

57:37.258 --> 57:41.745
Major, major booksellers in that book people.

57:41.865 --> 57:45.551
I mean, without accepting it, I'll say, that's the one.

57:46.773 --> 57:53.463
My wife and I went to Paris last year called Pia Merez.

57:53.483 --> 57:56.267
He was a great living bookseller.

57:56.770 --> 58:03.079
And then he invited us to dinner, and the first thing he says, he says, your Haven Award chapter is magic.

58:04.161 --> 58:05.583
Well, it's the dynamic, you know.

58:06.825 --> 58:09.068
And he moved with all these people.

58:09.649 --> 58:10.310
He brought books.

58:10.330 --> 58:14.055
It's not like Stephen was stealing from libraries, and he's anonymous.

58:14.977 --> 58:18.762
This guy was, you know, he was imposing himself on everything.

58:19.062 --> 58:25.971
You know, one of the elements that you mentioned was necessary to do this with money and just found a source for money to do that.

58:26.011 --> 58:26.632
Yeah, this is interesting.

58:26.672 --> 58:29.996
He wanted to sue me for $15 million, which is what he got from Davis and had to give back.

58:30.297 --> 58:31.198
He had a problem.

58:31.218 --> 58:35.704
I said, you get one tuna fish in your life, not two.

58:35.724 --> 58:35.984
$15 million.

58:36.004 --> 58:38.968
That's a nice round number.

58:38.988 --> 58:40.210
Nice round number.

58:40.578 --> 58:48.427
Yeah, but I had some nightmares, I'll tell you.

58:48.548 --> 58:49.609
He never filed through his records.

58:50.650 --> 58:53.494
Really, what he wanted is what he got.

58:53.514 --> 58:56.057
His military records.

58:56.077 --> 58:59.361
Really, what they wanted was to change, and that's what we gave him.

59:02.024 --> 59:07.711
So when I told Tom Campbell, you know Tom Campbell, he's a bibliographer.

59:07.731 --> 59:09.673
He teaches bibliography.

59:10.193 --> 59:14.862
He believed that every book you read, every copy, every state, every edition.

59:14.882 --> 59:15.623
And I told him this.

59:17.447 --> 59:18.769
And I told him about the change.

59:18.909 --> 59:19.891
He said, send that today.

59:19.911 --> 59:20.192
Send it.

59:20.673 --> 59:23.017
I said, I want to use this in my course.

59:23.158 --> 59:26.003
Let's say you have the first, second, third, fourth printing of my book.

59:28.167 --> 59:28.708
And you really

59:28.908 --> 59:31.051
if you want to track what it's within it.

59:31.071 --> 59:45.234
You really ought to know that a page and a half in chapter six has been very quietly taken out on the advice of counsel and changed in place with a very tepid thing.

59:45.374 --> 59:48.258
But I can't even tell you what it said.

59:48.278 --> 59:52.305
I haven't read it since the day I wrote it and faxed it in.

59:52.325 --> 59:53.687
So what's the fourth thing?

59:53.707 --> 59:55.129
Yep.

59:55.269 --> 59:55.389
Yep.

59:55.409 --> 59:57.092
And yet two of two years

59:57.528 --> 01:00:04.540
from the time of the fourth printing, the file suit, which has been in New York for a few years.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.386
And it's not from the first printing, it's every additional appearance.

01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:15.077
Even if the book was published in August of 95, even that way, it should have ended more than one year.

01:00:15.097 --> 01:00:15.899
It's one year in New York.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:20.346
I had to wait till January of 97.

01:00:21.693 --> 01:00:29.325
That's why I'm talking so regionally about it today.

01:00:29.345 --> 01:00:30.086
It's a great story.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.794
Well, it really angers me.

01:00:35.815 --> 01:00:40.462
I would mean to forget it.

01:00:40.482 --> 01:00:44.107
But if he called me a liar, he said, I don't know.

01:00:44.127 --> 01:00:46.090
I've never attempted to contact him.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.953
You see, because in rival cases, there's a lot.
