WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.756
Okay, we're on.

00:02.776 --> 00:03.317
I wouldn't mind.

00:04.538 --> 00:14.510
If there were some kind of commissions to serve one, and they wanted somebody who would call them as they see them, I wouldn't mind doing that.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.051
But I guess it's not there.

00:16.151 --> 00:19.896
I've done it, as you know, with the environmental commission.

00:22.018 --> 00:24.301
But the rest of it is not there.

00:24.721 --> 00:31.489
There may be points where it is of interest, but my 24-hour life

00:32.009 --> 00:38.355
23 hours and 59 minutes, which is much better off today than it was before.

00:38.836 --> 00:55.151
One last introspective quote on what the whole experience has done for your worldview, your view of life, of everything, just what you've been through, if you can give us the benefit of your experience.

00:55.271 --> 01:01.037
That's an open-ended question for contemplation, I guess.

01:02.350 --> 01:09.677
Well, I guess more than anything else, I end up feeling a great responsibility to keep the generations.

01:09.897 --> 01:15.602
And in the sense of, you know, we're all on this earth for a short period of time.

01:17.804 --> 01:18.805
You know, I'm lucky.

01:18.985 --> 01:21.848
I've not been, you know, more than five years.

01:23.069 --> 01:31.176
And, you know, for some people who find out they have cancer, they don't last six months.

01:32.371 --> 01:33.693
So it's all temporary.

01:34.754 --> 01:39.180
And there will be others that follow.

01:39.341 --> 01:46.891
And I guess the question is whether the time that we have here was really a trusteeship that was respected.

01:48.113 --> 01:56.224
And I think there's a real question about whether we're doing that in terms of energy issues, environmental issues, and economic issues.

01:56.544 --> 01:58.967
I don't think we are.

01:59.228 --> 02:01.551
I think the president's made great progress.

02:02.392 --> 02:09.081
Fortunately, our arms control, Gorbachev, I think, is really a marvelous addition to the world's themes.

02:09.281 --> 02:24.541
But it bothers me on things like, for example, energy issues when people are willing to close on nuclear power plants, which will force us to use up false refuges, which will then not be available for a future generation.

02:24.601 --> 02:30.089
And they don't care because they're all concerned about being anti-mental air.

02:30.409 --> 02:31.791
There's good politics in that.

02:32.345 --> 02:41.115
That kind of thing, which I used to accept before, as I understand politics as well, political, really bothers me now.

02:41.215 --> 02:45.500
It really gets to me in a way that was not the case before.

02:45.520 --> 02:53.709
It's just politics generally where people take positions that in the long run hurt the country, because it is good politics.

02:54.711 --> 03:01.238
Is there anything you would like to have accomplished that remains unfinished, that kind of frustrates you a little bit?

03:03.023 --> 03:04.684
In the political arena.

03:04.704 --> 03:07.847
In the political arena?

03:07.867 --> 03:09.328
I guess everything took a back seat.

03:11.230 --> 03:20.818
There must have been something that you'd like to have worked on, seen to its completion.

03:20.838 --> 03:24.901
I think your pause speaks volumes, too.

03:24.921 --> 03:28.164
Well, what is the Boston Garden?

03:28.204 --> 03:29.265
I'm talking nationally.

03:30.026 --> 03:32.828
I'm talking about from the Senate.

03:33.922 --> 03:48.739
You were going to run for one more term, and you did hope for a new definition of liberalism, and you certainly had expressed your intention to lead the charge for this new definition.

03:48.779 --> 03:51.122
I wonder, apparently it hasn't happened.

03:51.142 --> 03:53.325
Does this frustrate you in any way?

03:53.345 --> 03:59.592
Well, yeah, it does frustrate me, because I think in the long run we're not winning because of it.

04:00.668 --> 04:02.010
But, you know, I wrote the book.

04:02.030 --> 04:06.418
I don't know what more I could have done, even if I had not written the book, then perhaps.

04:07.560 --> 04:14.051
But I wrote the book, and most of the positions in the book I feel exactly the same way as us today, and hopefully we'll move.

04:15.173 --> 04:25.191
Obviously, Michael is much more that kind of politician than Walter Mondale was, and I feel very positive about that.

04:25.778 --> 04:27.861
could I have done that I did not do?

04:28.242 --> 04:30.025
Well, I think about regrets in life.

04:30.045 --> 04:38.258
I think about spending four years at Dartmouth as a swimmer, not learning anything, not taking out the classics.

04:38.638 --> 04:39.780
But you were a good swimmer, though.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.626
I was a good swimmer, yeah.

04:43.646 --> 04:45.409
Not knowing how to play the piano well.

04:46.511 --> 04:49.275
That's where my regrets come in, not so.

04:49.435 --> 04:49.536
Okay.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.759
Just one other question, if that's okay.

04:51.779 --> 04:53.642
I just wondered, you mentioned

04:54.719 --> 05:01.208
that you've had an experience that not many people come through as you have so splendidly.

05:01.709 --> 05:08.339
Did you draw on some inner spirit that you didn't even realize was there, or was it just, damn it, I'm not going to let this thing beat me?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.361
I just wonder what you drew on.

05:11.383 --> 05:24.642
Of course, you have a wonderful wife and three children, and I imagine that's enough inspiration for any young man faced with that kind of a... Well, obviously, you don't appreciate what a wellspring your family is,

05:25.111 --> 05:27.975
When you're out there, the U.S.

05:28.055 --> 05:34.583
Senate, and everybody's throwing garlands at you, and you get a very swell head about them.

05:34.763 --> 05:45.316
But ultimately, when the chips are down, if you don't have people close to you that care about you, you're really in a tough situation.

05:45.337 --> 05:53.667
And secondly, however you are on the religious field, you are more religious

05:54.288 --> 06:02.657
after something and when you go through it.

06:04.619 --> 06:13.048
If you don't believe that there's something beyond this, you really are weak inside.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.151
You don't have the same strength.

06:16.411 --> 06:23.839
Recognizing that you need a spirituality from someplace,

06:25.034 --> 06:44.779
It's very humbling, but in many respects you end up much more appreciative of things and more, not humble, but more recognizing your dependence on things.

06:44.799 --> 06:52.168
Being a public figure, and still a public figure, you certainly, I'm sure, have provided inspiration for many others.

06:52.288 --> 06:54.771
Do you hear from people about the example you set?

06:55.713 --> 06:56.854
I do a lot of talking.

06:56.874 --> 07:03.722
I wrote a second book on the experience, which is sort of passed around.

07:05.084 --> 07:11.411
And I talk to a lot of people who are about to go through the bone marrow transplant.

07:11.571 --> 07:25.467
Since I'm next to President Reagan and Nancy Reagan, one of the more known cancer patients, people who have it come up and just want to talk about it.

07:26.307 --> 07:30.571
Is there a sense of brotherhood, I wonder?

07:31.432 --> 07:34.454
You know, these are my army buddies.

07:34.474 --> 07:40.720
People who go through similar traumatic experiences are always close to whatever that experience happens to be.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.922
And cancer has always been the kind of thing.

07:42.962 --> 07:50.909
I've had a lot of people come up to me and say, the only people who know I had cancer was my husband, my doctor, and my sister.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.732
You're the only one I've told.

07:54.607 --> 07:58.492
Now that's changing, people are more willing to talk about it.

07:58.512 --> 08:06.681
For a long time, it's sort of like almost a family secret they have to be kept.

08:06.701 --> 08:08.463
I guess we've got to wrap it up.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.706
So you're a more religious person today?

08:11.066 --> 08:11.326
What?

08:11.807 --> 08:16.853
Are you a more religious person today?

08:17.313 --> 08:21.578
How did the Orthodox Church influence you?

08:21.598 --> 08:22.960
Or you're as Catholicism.

08:24.543 --> 08:28.409
Well, this is going to... You want the truth?

08:29.791 --> 08:33.077
Yes.

08:33.097 --> 08:44.455
What we found when we were going through all this was that first of all, believing God is not a function of one religion or another.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.137
You either believe it or you don't.

08:46.678 --> 08:52.187
And as we found the need to be more

08:53.112 --> 09:00.720
involved with church and religion, which obviously means the children have to be part of it.

09:00.820 --> 09:07.627
That's when we ran into this dilemma of my church versus my wife's church.

09:08.287 --> 09:22.562
And it just got to the point where it was not, you know, if you were talking Washington now, the churches, that getting the kids to go to the Greek churches is very difficult.

09:22.880 --> 09:30.547
Whereas the Episcopal Church, they're both in our neighborhood, was very comfortable for them.

09:30.947 --> 09:35.070
They saw women acolytes and women priests and that kind of thing.

09:35.771 --> 09:44.939
And we just got to the point where we decided, look, we want them to have a religious experience and we're going to go with this the least agony over the process of going to church.

09:44.959 --> 09:49.683
And so my children are Episcopalians.

09:49.703 --> 09:52.245
I mean, they're Greek Orthodoxes and

09:52.833 --> 09:54.555
They were baptized.

09:54.755 --> 10:04.246
Baptizing the Greek Orthodox, and I hope they will always be Greek Orthodox, but they're accolades in the Episcopal Church and feel like they're part of it.

10:04.346 --> 10:22.367
It really bothers me because I think there's such an inherent advantage of an ethnic identity, and to have it lost, which I think is what will happen eventually, because of doctrinal reasons.

10:22.718 --> 10:30.326
I know this is very controversial, but I just think at some point there's going to have to be some looking at the consequences.

10:31.988 --> 10:32.668
What do you suggest?

10:33.149 --> 10:35.511
What do you look for?

10:35.531 --> 10:49.026
Well, I just think that the Greek Church is going to have to look at the United States as different from Greece, because in Greece, Greeks marry Greeks.

10:49.046 --> 10:50.447
You don't run into this dilemma.

10:51.170 --> 10:54.654
In the United States, Greek, I don't know what the ratio is.

10:54.674 --> 10:55.575
Oh, it's unbelievable.

10:55.595 --> 10:56.176
75%.

10:57.377 --> 10:58.218
Nary no agree.

10:58.238 --> 10:59.159
Interfaith marriages.

10:59.219 --> 11:04.305
Oh, I have to say, my own guess is probably higher than that.

11:04.325 --> 11:12.654
No, it's an official, because I happen to be a theologian, so I... Anyway, in fact, it says interfaith marriages.

11:12.794 --> 11:19.101
It's an orthodox marriage, a non-orthodox, Roman Catholic, and whatever.

11:19.739 --> 11:23.204
Do you worship in the Orthodox Church, though?

11:24.325 --> 11:28.811
Well, I mean, I go to the church that my family goes to.

11:28.952 --> 11:31.215
I consider myself Greek Orthodox.

11:31.235 --> 11:35.681
I don't consider myself at all Episcopalian.

11:35.841 --> 11:37.643
But I go to their church.

11:37.844 --> 11:39.105
I participate in the church.

11:39.426 --> 11:40.688
I'm a member of the church.

11:40.888 --> 11:42.871
I'm on the board.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.135
Because that's where, if I were to die tomorrow,

11:47.887 --> 11:51.450
I know that they will continue their religious experience.

11:52.751 --> 12:07.185
Whereas if we were going to the Greek church and I would have died tomorrow, because it doesn't ring in them, particularly as young women, then the fear was they would have nothing.

12:07.205 --> 12:09.527
Quickly, how old are the kids now, by the way?

12:09.547 --> 12:10.928
7, 11, and 14.

12:11.589 --> 12:16.493
And I just think at some point the hierarchy in Greece

12:16.945 --> 12:27.374
is going to have to think about whether a viable church... I think the growth potential is enormous.

12:27.454 --> 12:34.741
Because I think in a mixed marriage, the Greek ethnicity is generally stronger than the ethnicity on the other side.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.043
So it's a natural advantage.

12:37.063 --> 12:45.450
I think it's dissipated by... If I had all boys, maybe it would be different.

12:46.544 --> 13:04.986
But I think particularly having daughters who feel strongly about equality and that they have as much right as boys to everything, to be in a religious experience with their, you know, they don't have what they could have in another church, you're at a severe disadvantage.

13:05.827 --> 13:12.054
And my kids, who I would prefer to have been Greek Orthodox, are going to be Episcopalians.

13:12.074 --> 13:13.716
And I think they...

13:14.202 --> 13:23.432
I respect that, but if they're going to lose their ethnicity in part because of that, I think that's a negative.

13:23.893 --> 13:29.379
Does the fact that your children are Episcopalians bother you, Mr. John?

13:30.420 --> 13:34.245
It bothers me because I think I am enriched by being Greek.

13:34.265 --> 13:40.632
What did you do to prevent this switch over to Episcopalians?

13:41.540 --> 13:43.102
Well, I didn't do anything.

13:43.182 --> 13:45.525
I didn't think it was my role to prevent.

13:45.625 --> 13:50.912
I think he tried to create a situation, and we did.

13:51.153 --> 14:00.965
We tried to go to the Greek church down there in the crisis, but it didn't work, and our needs at that point were met by the other church.

14:03.128 --> 14:04.250
Be more specific.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.752
What do you mean?

14:05.832 --> 14:07.794
You mean no one came to visit you?

14:07.814 --> 14:10.618
No one came to give you comfort from the Greek Orthodox Church?

14:10.835 --> 14:17.044
No, no, nobody came because we went all that time without anybody knowing.

14:18.406 --> 14:36.612
But in terms of a family seeking out a religious experience in which three of the people in the church, one is Episcopalian, one is the Greek Orthodox, but three women, young women, and they look at two churches.

14:36.632 --> 14:40.538
One church is in a language that they don't understand.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.289
One is the language they do.

14:43.809 --> 14:45.331
And one frankly offers them more.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.633
It's like being a free agent.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.035
It's who you're going to sign with, right?

14:50.275 --> 14:54.960
And one church says if you're a woman, there are some things you cannot be.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.343
That's what I mean by that statement, by the way.

14:59.083 --> 15:09.293
Let's say that your children tomorrow decide to become Muslim, or Hindus, or Jehovah Witnesses.

15:10.015 --> 15:12.838
Will you allow them to become?

15:12.878 --> 15:14.360
Will you go along with them?

15:15.321 --> 15:22.290
Will you go to the... In this country with women today, you don't allow or disallow.

15:22.930 --> 15:24.012
They do what they want.

15:24.512 --> 15:31.020
And if you have any brain, you create a situation that encourages them to move.

15:31.501 --> 15:37.828
If I ever said to one of my daughters, you cannot be X, they will be X more so.

15:38.770 --> 15:46.037
I would suggest that you don't get in front of the window.

15:46.057 --> 16:01.411
I don't know your camera, but I just have enough experience with these.

16:03.693 --> 16:06.516
Thank you.

16:06.901 --> 16:08.843
Why don't you take a picture of me in the center.

16:08.864 --> 16:09.264
Sure I will.

16:09.785 --> 16:11.086
A couple of little old guys.

16:12.368 --> 16:14.771
It's doing very well.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.394
Now, just when that little light goes on.

16:17.414 --> 16:18.496
Can you focus with this?

16:18.816 --> 16:19.858
Yes, I will.

16:19.898 --> 16:21.179
Why don't you let me focus?

16:21.239 --> 16:23.642
If it's all right, I can bounce it off the ceiling.

16:25.124 --> 16:26.686
Stand right where I'm standing right now.

16:30.772 --> 16:31.913
Okay, thanks.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.222
Thank you.

16:38.803 --> 16:43.232
Do you mind if my piece will be running after the election?

16:44.074 --> 16:46.559
Would you mind if I give you a call after that?

16:46.639 --> 16:50.026
I think I probably need your phone number.

16:51.068 --> 16:55.757
Here is 508... Let me make sure my machine is off.
