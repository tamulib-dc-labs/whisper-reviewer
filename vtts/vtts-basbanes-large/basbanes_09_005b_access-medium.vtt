00:02.782 --> 00:12.456
I was thinking of David because you wrote Fiche.

00:12.576 --> 00:14.679
That was my next question.

00:14.719 --> 00:21.429
Well, I haven't talked for two years now, and it doesn't look like I'm actually more than that, four years.

00:21.449 --> 00:31.303
But it is kind of interesting that you have two of the most prominent and successful children's book writer-illustrators,

00:32.127 --> 00:36.233
You know, we're here in Providence and at the same school in that time.

00:36.313 --> 00:38.496
Well, you know, we're both here because Ristie's here.

00:38.736 --> 00:41.820
And, you know... Is that a school too fascinating?

00:41.840 --> 00:42.521
Well, sure it does.

00:42.601 --> 00:43.823
Sure it does.

00:44.283 --> 00:46.366
So I didn't study illustration in the school.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.089
And actually, David didn't either.

00:48.109 --> 00:49.050
He studied architecture.

00:49.791 --> 00:52.675
And maybe that tells you something, doesn't it?

00:54.217 --> 00:54.597
It does.

00:54.617 --> 00:55.098
I don't know.

00:55.278 --> 00:56.239
I don't know what it tells us.

00:56.260 --> 01:00.345
That we didn't discover what we should have done while we were still in college.

01:01.169 --> 01:05.093
Did you have any questions for me?

01:05.133 --> 01:13.501
Would you kindly inscribe this book for Connie and for Nick Mads, please?

01:13.521 --> 01:18.806
Do you have a card for you?

01:19.067 --> 01:29.477
Now that I know where you live, I'll be pleased to send you copies of the piece if you'd like.

01:29.497 --> 01:30.518
No, I'd like to shoot a couple of

01:30.852 --> 01:35.937
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:35.957 --> 01:41.763
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:41.783 --> 01:42.024
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:42.044 --> 01:56.018
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:56.038 --> 01:56.278
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:56.299 --> 01:56.539
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:56.559 --> 01:56.799
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:56.819 --> 01:57.099
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:57.119 --> 01:57.360
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:57.380 --> 01:57.620
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:57.640 --> 01:57.880
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:57.900 --> 01:58.140
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:58.160 --> 01:58.401
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:58.421 --> 01:58.801
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:58.821 --> 01:59.522
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:59.542 --> 01:59.922
C-O-M-N-R-E?

01:59.942 --> 02:00.183
C-O-M-N-R-E?

02:00.203 --> 02:00.443
C-O-M-N-R-E?

02:00.463 --> 02:00.623
C-O-M-N-

02:05.378 --> 02:06.139
Great.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.882
Thank you.

02:07.902 --> 02:11.088
And this is with Viking, and the first collaboration is with Hogan-Metlin.

02:11.408 --> 02:11.809
Right.

02:11.829 --> 02:15.916
With whom you are still involved.

02:16.997 --> 02:24.931
Viking, you know, I'll bid Hogan.

02:24.971 --> 02:28.537
They have the privilege of publishing it.

02:28.557 --> 02:29.599
Where it goes.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.622
I thought that's dry now, I'm sure.

02:34.808 --> 03:01.710
you know if you don't mind would you just because i have this would you just would you mind just signing this little suite of her this is kind of nice we're rather determined collectors i should point out i did an interview with mark last year on his novel and i brought along

03:02.973 --> 03:05.495
Swan Lake, which you had signed for me some years earlier.

03:06.556 --> 03:14.204
And he said, separately, we've signed thousands of these, but he says, I think there can only be a handful of books that you've done.

03:14.824 --> 03:22.472
Well, there's one in Seattle, I know, because when I was out in Seattle, somebody came to a book signing with one that Mark had signed.

03:22.492 --> 03:25.915
I went to him with one that you had signed, and he was quite impressed by that.

03:26.676 --> 03:29.699
So therefore, we probably have a pretty good deal.

03:29.719 --> 03:31.140
Do you want to take a couple of shots?

03:31.390 --> 03:32.781
No, no.

03:32.942 --> 03:36.328
Any funny things sticking out of the top of my head?

03:36.348 --> 03:36.912
I think you look good.
