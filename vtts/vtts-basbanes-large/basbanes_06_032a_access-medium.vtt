00:03.929 --> 00:07.294
I'm sorry, Dave, you said this is probably... I don't mind showing you, Mr. Scullers.

00:07.515 --> 00:22.037
In many cases, I sit there with them so that they don't accidentally... Now, there were actually two crusades before the main crusade.

00:22.077 --> 00:28.327
The main crusade, you remember, had Henry the Lionhearted and Barbarossa, Frederick Barbarossa, and so forth.

00:28.347 --> 00:32.113
And that was the third crusade that had Henry the Lionhearted, and that's the one we're talking about.

00:32.431 --> 00:42.042
So this is the big one, where all of Europe got together, and they went down there, and they were going to save their maintenance and take over the land, make it safe for Americans.

00:42.062 --> 00:47.929
I mean... What a marvelous place.

00:49.611 --> 00:50.632
What a good excuse, eh?

00:51.153 --> 00:59.282
Now, I put this here so I don't have to touch this, but this is, you can see this is right here, and this is right here.

00:59.515 --> 01:00.877
And here are the words right here.

01:00.897 --> 01:17.960
You can even make out these words that, to show you the flavor of the document, this one says, signum vivifus, who knows, crucix in vestro pectoris circumference.

01:17.980 --> 01:27.953
This is the sign of the living cross on your proud chest, on your round chest, in Latin right.

01:28.203 --> 01:49.474
So he's saying that you are going to be wearing the sign of the Holy Cross, and they had this big red cross, which was the English, by the way, I don't know what, it was the English flag, had a big red cross, and that's what the knights would wear, completely white uniforms or robes with a white cross on their chest.

01:49.494 --> 01:51.877
And so he said that's one thing he has to put in.

01:51.917 --> 01:54.181
Did you tell me the year in this, by the way?

01:54.241 --> 01:56.865
1183, I believe.

01:56.885 --> 01:57.906
I don't see.

01:58.207 --> 01:59.769
Only 800 years old corn.

02:00.590 --> 02:00.910
All right.

02:00.930 --> 02:09.181
In good shape.

02:09.261 --> 02:10.983
What is that green thing?

02:11.323 --> 02:11.984
Is that a stitch?

02:12.004 --> 02:12.865
Is that like a stitch?

02:12.905 --> 02:16.390
Yes, that's what you call ancient preservation.

02:17.771 --> 02:23.599
Instead of... Nowadays, they can almost create new paper around and reseal a pair.

02:24.260 --> 02:27.083
A hundred years ago, they used to use something called scotch tape.

02:27.316 --> 02:28.778
Yeah, well, I'm glad they used that.

02:28.798 --> 02:30.441
Yeah, well, either one.

02:30.641 --> 02:32.324
Yeah, that's better.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.006
Do you have a provenance for this?

02:34.327 --> 02:36.450
Do you know where it's been for the last 800 years?

02:36.791 --> 02:37.812
No, I don't.

02:38.133 --> 02:38.513
I don't.

02:38.633 --> 02:45.083
I know where I got it from, but I... It's interesting to know where it spent centuries.

02:45.364 --> 02:46.525
Yeah, that's true.

02:47.827 --> 02:51.213
Something one of your scholars can go do.

02:51.333 --> 02:55.399
We can have this fit with modern-day techniques, which you can barely see the thing.

02:55.632 --> 03:05.966
But my theory is that 100 years from now, our modern-day repair techniques are going to look like the stitching that they did probably in the 1200s, trying to stitch it back together.

03:06.046 --> 03:19.865
And so why not leave the document, carefully use it, and then let some future generation fix it perfectly rather than fix it with some medieval technique that we have today.

03:19.905 --> 03:21.628
You're looking to the future.

03:21.808 --> 03:23.570
Yeah.

03:23.590 --> 03:24.171
So I never touched

03:24.455 --> 03:28.600
Unless it meets de-esignification, we never try to repair document.

03:28.681 --> 03:30.944
We'll leave it for 100 years from now when they really know it.

03:31.024 --> 03:35.810
Or 200 years from now when the estate's worth $560 million, as you said.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.556
My own thought, of course, is that means you never repair it.

03:40.857 --> 03:47.826
Unless they prove that their technique is, you cannot tell the difference between their repair and their embodiment.

03:47.866 --> 03:48.907
Then they can go ahead and do it.

03:49.468 --> 03:53.213
Until then, you leave it until science is up to that stage.

03:53.918 --> 03:56.321
And it's in good shape, actually.

03:56.541 --> 03:59.265
Yeah, except for the tears, it's in good shape.

03:59.726 --> 04:08.237
For 817 years, I mean... Of course, this is an animal skin, and that usually, if someone didn't fold it up five million times, it would still look brand new, which animal skin does.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.663
Did you say from John you got this as well?

04:12.683 --> 04:12.903
No?

04:13.003 --> 04:13.944
No, I did not.

04:13.964 --> 04:19.812
I got it from someone else, which I... Some I can talk about, but rather than... That's fine.

04:19.852 --> 04:22.035
Don't mind my asking.

04:22.538 --> 04:33.736
The Confederate Constitution, they did not want me to say where it came from, so I didn't, you know, for so many years, and I think the years are off, that's why I was trying to think of what his name was.

04:34.257 --> 04:42.069
But a lot of these things, people are embarrassed that they are, you know, trading them in for money and so forth.

04:42.150 --> 04:43.672
Yeah, but they've gone to a good place.

04:43.832 --> 04:49.221
Oh, yeah, I think they have, because we're going to make sure everybody gets a chance to see him.

04:49.454 --> 04:51.556
And you're going to protect them and preserve them.

04:51.576 --> 04:52.377
Absolutely.

04:52.517 --> 04:54.139
And allow access to them.

04:54.259 --> 04:55.120
That's the key.

04:55.160 --> 04:55.661
That's it.

04:56.161 --> 04:58.364
And then I think we can wrap it up.

04:58.384 --> 04:58.584
Okay.

04:59.525 --> 05:01.267
We've got to go see.

05:01.287 --> 05:02.869
We're trying to have everybody once.

05:02.949 --> 05:07.033
We usually have two or three a day.

05:07.254 --> 05:13.080
And then for a couple of days long.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.664
Well, let's get used to it.

05:17.104 --> 05:17.465
Thank you.

05:17.505 --> 05:19.427
Thank goodness.

05:20.352 --> 05:36.075
Dave's license plate, Annette, is California license plate, the words D-A-D-A, the next word K-A-R, Dakar, and it's a Cadillac, a sense of humor.

05:36.936 --> 05:45.568
One of the questions that they are very interested in, is book selling different today from what it was in Dr. Rosenbach's time?

05:45.589 --> 05:46.630
That's one of her questions.

05:46.998 --> 05:50.562
And of course, you see what Lou is doing, and they're businessmen.

05:50.582 --> 05:54.487
I mean, at that extent, it's different.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.711
We're all merchants in the final analysis.

05:57.771 --> 06:01.095
For the sake of my typist, I just want to say that Annette, we're talking to you.

06:01.115 --> 06:15.733
Ralph Sipworth is president of Joseph the Provider, which is a very highly regarded and excellent bookseller of modern first editions in Santa Barbara, California, August 8th, right?

06:16.614 --> 06:16.954
Thank you, Ralph.

06:17.457 --> 06:37.515
Well, I was going to say that one, I think, basic difference between selling books in 1990 and back in the 30s and 40s is that the process has become more democratized.

06:38.536 --> 06:46.283
In the old days, someone like Dr. Rosenberg would have his two or three

06:47.140 --> 07:02.719
And they were usually, you know, captains of industry, very wealthy men, like, maybe like Bradley Martin.

07:02.799 --> 07:12.270
And they would do most of their business, or at least a large part of it, just with a very few customers.

07:14.950 --> 07:22.499
And they were, to the collector, a gentleman book seller.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.507
Because young people did not collect to the degree that they do now.

07:29.188 --> 07:32.232
We still sell to some very wealthy people.

07:33.313 --> 07:44.687
But we have lots and lots of upwardly mobile, young, I guess you could say,

07:45.781 --> 07:49.166
but that really is not the right word.

07:49.186 --> 08:04.070
But just young, educated people who like the idea of collecting first editions, you know, who have the pride of ownership, like the idea of seeing these beautiful objects on their shelves.

08:05.192 --> 08:10.000
Do you think it's a passion for the book, as it was, say, for Bradley Martin?

08:11.043 --> 08:15.547
I really hate to use the phrase, but one person, I think we use it.

08:15.567 --> 08:17.789
Well, investment in disposable income.

08:17.809 --> 08:23.435
I mean, I'll be like, Southern California, we see what is referred to as disposable income.

08:23.515 --> 08:26.718
Actually, no income is really disposable.

08:26.918 --> 08:34.685
Do you find that this is one way that people feel it's a little bit of money?

08:34.705 --> 08:40.611
Well, my experience is that the best collectors are interested in the books.

08:41.114 --> 09:05.430
However, having said that, and living in our society today, to deny the importance of spending your money in a way in which not only is it not foolish, but with thoughts down the line of possible appreciation, I think that's inescapable.

09:05.450 --> 09:10.497
It's just that I do think that the people

09:11.557 --> 09:22.971
who have come, at least to us, over the last 10, 15 years, or like 10 years, with investment paramount in their mind, those people usually don't stay the course.

09:23.732 --> 09:27.757
They get in, and then they get out, and they're on to something else.

09:27.777 --> 09:36.248
I think that books are special, and that in order for someone to stay a book collector, he has to have some feeling for it.

09:37.004 --> 09:40.989
I have two questions.

09:41.069 --> 09:42.732
How long is Joseph writing?

09:43.252 --> 09:47.498
Well, we're getting ready to do our 20th anniversary catalog, which is what I was doing before you came in.

09:48.099 --> 09:50.802
When you send me one, you'll inscribe it.

09:50.822 --> 09:50.923
Sure.

09:50.943 --> 09:52.645
Would you do that?

09:52.665 --> 09:52.965
Sure.

09:52.985 --> 09:53.927
That would be nice.

09:53.947 --> 09:57.251
I'm collecting inscribed things along the room.

09:57.932 --> 09:59.434
Interesting.

09:59.937 --> 10:05.463
when I looked at the Dr. Miller book and I said, ah, it's not a very good condition right now.

10:05.543 --> 10:07.625
Obviously, I was being sarcastic because it's great.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.948
And you said, Joseph, the provided condition.

10:10.968 --> 10:13.351
Tell me about that, because you do have a reputation.

10:14.192 --> 10:23.201
Well, um... The quality of your books, you can... Well, it's just that there are certain rules to this game.

10:23.822 --> 10:28.827
One of the rules, outside of the intrinsic importance of a book, is its condition.

10:28.987 --> 10:29.708
And I guess...

10:29.806 --> 10:57.180
a long time ago, we decided that we were going to really go to inordinate lengths to get the finest copies that we could afford and correspondingly to pass up decent or ordinary copies of books that we could buy and sell for a profit because we felt that having those ordinary copies

10:57.650 --> 11:06.705
would take away from the idea of what we were trying to do, which is find the best to collect as copies.

11:06.725 --> 11:11.834
And, you know, I think it's kind of a challenge.

11:12.395 --> 11:16.682
From the beginning, are you the founder of Joseph of the Vieta?

11:16.702 --> 11:23.674
Just tell me, I mean, I know the genesis of the name, but tell me why you chose the name of Joseph of the Vieta.

11:24.194 --> 11:28.658
I can tell you very briefly, but I can also give you something I wrote on it.

11:29.139 --> 11:31.441
Basically, Joseph was my grandfather.

11:34.484 --> 11:45.916
He died when I was young, and I guess it was my first close personal experience with death.

11:46.036 --> 11:54.184
I just cast about when I decided to start this crazy business 20 years ago for

11:54.451 --> 11:59.236
something that didn't sound like the Book Nook or the Book Corner.

11:59.256 --> 12:13.190
And it just came to me, and then the whole idea of providing books for people and that literary allusion to Thomas Mann, it kind of all came together.

12:13.270 --> 12:23.580
Probably the one intuitive idea that I've ever had.

12:23.729 --> 12:26.292
Well, the logo is actually a photograph.

12:27.634 --> 12:34.042
It was an artist's rendition of a photograph of my grandfather.

12:34.062 --> 12:39.989
And now that I've gotten older and started to gray, little people say that it looks a little like that.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.753
A lot of people mistakenly say, Joe, call you Joe.

12:42.773 --> 12:43.874
A lot of people call you Joe.

12:43.994 --> 12:46.057
Yeah, I think they do.

12:46.438 --> 12:47.299
Joe's a pro.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.420
He's actually Rob Sibler.

12:48.822 --> 12:50.844
Was Larry in from the beginning with you?

12:50.864 --> 12:54.268
No, Larry came in about a year later, but as I say, I will give you something that way.

12:54.288 --> 12:54.648
Okay, great.

12:55.789 --> 12:59.233
Did you define your scope from the beginning as modern for us?

12:59.333 --> 13:00.454
Yes.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.275
And why is that?

13:02.016 --> 13:10.344
Well, I mean, let's face it, it's the easiest entree into rare books.

13:10.745 --> 13:16.231
But I was an English major, and where was this?

13:16.251 --> 13:18.593
At City College, New York, and I was a New Yorker.

13:18.961 --> 13:36.223
Yeah, right, and had kind of haphazardly pursued a masters and was writing book reviews for several publications in New York and reading contemporary literature.

13:36.243 --> 13:38.165
So that's what we got into.

13:38.746 --> 13:47.517
About a year or two after we started, we expanded a little and then decided that rather than

13:48.155 --> 13:56.826
stretch ourselves thin and maybe dilute the quality of the books that we handle, we would limit ourselves to 20th century literature, more or less.

13:57.867 --> 14:03.754
But within that small framework, expand from within.

14:04.395 --> 14:16.069
And so we have done little things through the years, like we were, I think, among the very first to collect Vietnam War novels.

14:16.319 --> 14:21.826
and baseball literature, and black literature, and Hollywood novels.

14:22.167 --> 14:25.191
And these are all little pockets.

14:25.211 --> 14:27.193
And you do put out specialized catalogs.

14:27.213 --> 14:27.534
We do.

14:27.574 --> 14:29.797
Subject literature, too.

14:29.817 --> 14:38.969
One of your catalogs that I love is books that became movies, which is a great Hollywood edit.

14:39.009 --> 14:41.792
You get a lot of Hollywood people that would love to.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.795
Well, I do.

14:43.859 --> 14:54.977
There's, I think, a growing interest in that field because a lot of the bright, young kids who are not coming out of college don't go into literature.

14:54.997 --> 15:00.846
They become movie makers or they write for television or the movies.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.313
And so there is that interest.

15:05.593 --> 15:11.723
You know, it's kind of a very personal interest that a lot of

15:12.023 --> 15:15.927
younger people have, and they're not limited to people around LA.

15:16.367 --> 15:26.556
Do you agree with the assertion some people make that the real action in book business and book traders out here in California?

15:26.797 --> 15:41.170
Well, I think that as the population of the country has shifted westward to places like the Sun Belt and the west coast, and as some of the inner cities back east

15:41.791 --> 15:54.805
Detroit, Philadelphia, New York, where the quality of life has deteriorated and where corporations have deserted by the hundreds.

15:56.226 --> 16:04.956
I think it's inevitable that there are more book collectors coming out west and residing in California than ever before.

16:05.116 --> 16:10.802
I think it's a trend that hasn't seen its end.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.654
showed you our mailing list.

16:14.176 --> 16:27.675
Most of our collectors are really on both coasts, either in New York or Boston or Philadelphia, or up and down California and Oregon, and are disproportionate, really.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.439
But most of them come from California.

16:31.080 --> 16:39.772
So would you say most of your business is a catalog trade, or do you have people that come to the store?

16:39.792 --> 16:40.333
Oh, no.

16:40.786 --> 16:45.151
do come, but they come the way you've come for a particular purpose.

16:45.311 --> 16:52.578
Or if they drive and sleep... I've been in business with you for a number of years, bought quite a few books from you.

16:53.639 --> 16:57.964
The booksellers come through and collectors, but basically we're mail-order audiences.

16:58.024 --> 17:06.693
And I think one reason that you can do so well through the mail is because your quality is understood.

17:07.354 --> 17:08.515
I can buy a book from you

17:08.984 --> 17:11.688
And I know I'm not going to be disappointed in the quality.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.874
Or you have thoroughly explained its condition to my satisfaction.

17:15.894 --> 17:16.155
Well, we try.

17:16.195 --> 17:17.156
I mean, we're not involved.

17:17.557 --> 17:19.620
I mean, we can't satisfy everybody.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.783
And it is a subjective thing.

17:21.803 --> 17:25.909
Cuts, well, your prices are higher than others.

17:25.929 --> 17:27.672
You might be, but of course, you probably have to pay more.

17:28.353 --> 17:34.803
Well, they're higher, but I think one has to talk about a particular copy.

17:35.143 --> 17:36.325
I mean, I can't say that.

17:36.676 --> 17:43.382
situation normal is a $200 book or a $300 book or a $500 book or a $10 copy.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.704
It depends on the copy.

17:45.724 --> 17:46.405
You're not buying the book.

17:46.545 --> 17:49.727
You're buying a copy of the book.

17:49.747 --> 17:50.288
Is it inscribed?

17:50.488 --> 17:54.692
You know, who it is inscribed to and all that.

17:54.712 --> 18:00.177
Do you find that there's a different kind of collector in California?

18:00.197 --> 18:02.759
And this kind of came up, and let me give you the background on it.

18:02.839 --> 18:06.362
And Luke said it for publication.

18:07.085 --> 18:20.740
He has people that come in and say, gee, I want to be a book collector, and I want a collection within a year or two years, and build me a collection, and here are some names.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.423
I've never heard of that kind of a collector before.

18:24.664 --> 18:35.235
Well, I think... I'm sure implicit in this is that there's a lot of money going to be... Well, there is, and also Lou and Ben are right in that.

18:35.975 --> 18:58.964
you know, little strip of land there, you know, where they all drive, where all the little, not only the little blue-haired ladies, but, you know, the people who are busy all day and who can't devote the time to developing their book collections the way, you know, a book collector usually knows his collection better than anyone else.

18:59.384 --> 19:00.245
That's right.

19:00.265 --> 19:05.492
But I can see where Lou and Ben, because of their reputation and their location,

19:05.877 --> 19:09.442
have attracted that kind of approach to bookselling.

19:09.462 --> 19:14.228
It's not, I don't find too many people like that.

19:14.328 --> 19:21.238
I do get people who, once they start, will ask, you know, for help.

19:21.298 --> 19:33.834
But to say what I think you're saying is that they are placing the responsibility for what goes into the collection to the bookseller, pretty much.

19:33.874 --> 19:35.817
And that is not, you know,

19:36.117 --> 19:37.699
my experience very often.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.522
I'm not against it.

19:39.542 --> 19:40.283
Who would be?

19:40.423 --> 19:41.805
I'm not even being critical of it.

19:41.825 --> 19:42.366
Sure.

19:42.426 --> 19:46.012
It certainly does represent a departure from what I've seen.

19:46.552 --> 19:47.454
That's right.

19:47.474 --> 19:47.634
It is.

19:47.754 --> 19:51.199
And maybe it's going to become more global.

19:51.219 --> 19:57.629
But I think even that Heritage as an institution represents a departure of bookselling from what I've seen.

19:57.649 --> 20:01.655
I mean, they really do approach it quite proudly as businessmen.

20:02.716 --> 20:05.280
I think that's one of the

20:05.581 --> 20:22.516
but leads us back to what we talked about at the beginning, about the change from the Rosenbach kind of John Fleming's book practice, where they only dealt with the very top stratum of the market.

20:23.077 --> 20:34.947
And Lou and Ben, I mean, they started with nothing, and they have now, I think, one of the top book firms in the world.

20:35.855 --> 20:48.167
They're more permissive than we are about certain things, like conditions.

20:48.307 --> 20:55.855
I mean, they can have the greatest copies, too, but it won't be... It's just a different approach.

20:56.275 --> 20:59.999
Well, which for them, which for them?

21:00.039 --> 21:04.123
Well, see, that's one of the things I like about being a bookseller, is that there are

21:04.677 --> 21:11.625
so many different ways in which, you know, you have the independence to run your business.

21:11.645 --> 21:25.661
I mean, I liked, one of the reasons I got into the book business was I liked the idea of just buying a book, putting it in a catalog, sending the catalog out, and back comes a check in the mail.

21:26.322 --> 21:29.766
And you mail this book out and you never have to look at the customer.

21:30.246 --> 21:31.748
That was enormously appealing to me.

21:32.048 --> 21:46.591
And it's much better than buying a bookshop, or establishing one, and then just sitting there and waiting for people to come in the door, and then maybe talking to somebody you don't feel like talking to, or being bound by regular hours.

21:47.432 --> 21:57.027
One of the questions that the editor of the publication has asked me, because the hook I'm trying to hang on is the Martins and Daviti sales.

21:57.715 --> 22:02.102
really great sale in the last 20 years, kind of a watermark sale.

22:03.283 --> 22:06.188
And so then she said, well, our auction is really exciting.

22:06.588 --> 22:09.673
And I said, it will be an hour exciting.

22:09.733 --> 22:21.411
And I took notes of one exchange, Ralph, where you were sitting at the right rear of the South Beach room and spent on the room from the 1970 bookshop.

22:21.431 --> 22:22.473
Oh, yeah, Steve Longstall.

22:22.493 --> 22:22.753
Steve.

22:23.174 --> 22:26.018
Steve Longstall went head to head

22:26.977 --> 22:31.724
up to $60,000 for an item, and he finally purchased it.

22:31.804 --> 22:32.846
I don't recall the item.

22:32.866 --> 22:33.547
It's in my notes.

22:34.368 --> 22:37.874
There might be a change.

22:37.914 --> 22:41.159
But that was as exciting an exchange as I've seen.

22:41.219 --> 22:48.630
It wasn't the $2 million of the Shakespeare's, but it was... Well, it's interesting because

22:49.201 --> 23:07.464
what happens, and we talked about this, some of those high Bradley Martin prices came about as a result of what I call auction fever, where you don't want to give up the book, even though your head is telling you that's too much to pay for the book.

23:07.484 --> 23:11.930
Your heart, your ego are saying, I'm not going to let him get that book.

23:11.950 --> 23:14.894
And so you do that in an open arena.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.039
And the same thing does not obtain when a

23:19.289 --> 23:25.217
when you put out a catalog, then you're trying to usually stay within reason.

23:25.537 --> 23:32.466
Also, there's a difference between a bookseller buying a book for stock or a client.

23:32.546 --> 23:43.440
In this case, I believe I was acting on the instructions of a client, and I may even have exceeded those instructions a little bit.

23:43.741 --> 23:46.004
you know, I felt that it was worth pursuing.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.987
What goes through your mind in a thing like this?

23:48.007 --> 23:49.429
Well, you don't have a chance to really think.

23:49.449 --> 23:51.312
I mean, it all happens so fast.

23:51.893 --> 23:55.698
The best thing to do is be prepared, you know, and we do a lot of studying.

23:56.299 --> 24:03.349
And, you know, I think it was probably one of the James Joyce books and Scribe Joyce.

24:03.970 --> 24:05.452
I would have to check.

24:05.472 --> 24:06.433
It's all a blur now.

24:06.674 --> 24:09.578
It was so intense because you were looking at each other.

24:09.798 --> 24:11.260
And that doesn't normally happen.

24:11.621 --> 24:13.123
I mean, even at the much higher

24:13.373 --> 24:17.317
Sometimes you're bidding against the telephone, or some guy behind the glass upstairs.

24:17.657 --> 24:29.189
But you two guys, he was at the left extreme, he was at the right extreme, and looking at each other, and he would go, and he would go, and I was standing right here in the room, and I said, this is really exciting.

24:29.209 --> 24:31.371
Yeah, but see that talking.

24:31.952 --> 24:36.256
That's also part of this democratization I'm talking about.

24:36.637 --> 24:41.001
When I came to New York to look at the Bradley Martin books, who was there?

24:41.420 --> 24:52.595
but Steve and Lou, or Ben, whoever was there, and 15 other people, dealers, with whom we are friendly competitors.

24:52.615 --> 24:58.723
And, you know, there are only a few of us at these things.

24:58.743 --> 25:09.537
And what's happening is because of the publicity and because of a growing public preference for high spots,

25:09.938 --> 25:17.708
I mean, not every book at the Bradley Martin sale went for, you know, record... Yeah, sure.

25:17.748 --> 25:27.101
What I'm saying is that, but for the very important, the high spots, those books, you know, usually went for two, three times.

25:27.602 --> 25:28.182
Or more.

25:28.202 --> 25:28.803
Yeah, or more.

25:29.564 --> 25:34.791
And so that's, I think, a recent change.

25:34.971 --> 25:36.874
And someone like Mark Hein,

25:37.664 --> 25:43.673
I think is as good at it as anybody, you know, pursuing the high spot.

25:43.693 --> 25:46.156
Mark likes to say, you know Mark, don't you?

25:46.176 --> 25:51.624
Mark likes to say, I only know a hundred books, but I know those, I think I know those books as well as anyone.

25:51.644 --> 26:05.123
Well, I mean, you know, he's being a little facetious, but what he has done is, he is not interested in every Herman Melville title, but, you know, Moby Dick, yes.

26:05.525 --> 26:07.087
and so on down the line.

26:07.227 --> 26:14.614
Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, but maybe not some of the rarer, but more obscure Mark Twins.

26:14.654 --> 26:15.956
Scarcer, perhaps.

26:15.976 --> 26:16.857
Yeah, scarcer.

26:16.877 --> 26:19.139
Scarcer isn't necessarily rare, isn't it?

26:19.159 --> 26:19.379
No.

26:19.479 --> 26:20.881
Oh, no.

26:20.921 --> 26:24.484
A rare book does not necessarily have to be a scarce book.

26:25.165 --> 26:30.030
There are perhaps 30 or 40 Gutenberg Bibles, for instance.

26:30.050 --> 26:34.114
Well, I mean, there's a book vocabulary just like there's a wine vocabulary, and when people

26:34.735 --> 26:40.380
In common used terms, they get to mean the same thing to those people.

26:41.201 --> 26:49.469
But someone outside the book world might look at a catalog and say, see, a good copy only, and say, oh, that's wonderful.

26:49.489 --> 26:54.274
Well, a good copy is, you know, a euphemism for a bad copy.

26:54.294 --> 26:55.635
Good means lousy.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.056
Yeah, good means lousy.

26:57.156 --> 26:58.558
Very good means okay.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.081
So there are conventions that, you know, you learn.

27:02.181 --> 27:04.303
If you start to get interested, it's fine.

27:04.604 --> 27:09.490
Sure, but one person's fine, and another's very good.

27:09.690 --> 27:12.394
I mean, so that's, you know.

27:12.414 --> 27:16.039
Do you have 20 years in the business?

27:16.239 --> 27:19.423
What did you do prior to book selling, by the way?

27:19.443 --> 27:22.547
Oh, I just had various editorial jobs, sales.

27:22.947 --> 27:24.329
I drove a truck for a while.

27:24.389 --> 27:26.492
And you moved out here when?

27:26.632 --> 27:27.513
I started a novel.

27:27.533 --> 27:29.295
I mean, there are all kinds of things.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.418
And you moved out here when?

27:31.438 --> 27:32.499
In 1957.

27:32.519 --> 27:33.801
And then three years after that.

27:34.540 --> 27:45.217
Do you have, I mean, my book, and when we say book collecting, of course, it's a generic term that embraces manuscripts, of course, and it's important.

27:45.237 --> 27:49.204
And it's really about the passion of the collector and the motivation of the collector.

27:49.224 --> 27:56.335
And as one who is in the business and who has dealt with people such as myself for 20 years, do you have a fix?

27:56.416 --> 28:01.003
Do you have an understanding of what passion, what it is that drives a person to learn to own?

28:01.456 --> 28:08.363
Well, it is, but I think that, well, for one thing, I think that they were born collectors.

28:09.784 --> 28:21.515
Carter Burton, who was one of the foremost collectors of our time, Carter told me that when he was, I don't know, three, four years old, he was already collecting toy soldiers.

28:21.535 --> 28:25.859
And I collected toy soldiers, but I didn't have them anymore.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.662
I mean, I either broke them or

28:29.047 --> 28:29.808
threw them away.

28:30.228 --> 28:41.280
Carter still has this, because that was in him, and I can define it by the instinct to preserve something, and the pride of possession.

28:41.520 --> 28:47.366
Those two, I think, are very important motivations for a collection.

28:49.869 --> 28:57.737
I guess the best way it's ever been expressed for me is Larry McMurtry wrote a book about an antique dealer called

28:58.375 --> 29:00.077
Yeah, okay.

29:00.097 --> 29:10.629
Well, I mean, Cadillac Jack goes to visit this man who, of all things, has accumulated and collected bird's nests.

29:10.649 --> 29:11.951
All sorts of bird's nests.

29:11.971 --> 29:18.218
And he comes into this house, and they're all over the place, on the walls, and he's tripping over them.

29:19.139 --> 29:26.728
And I guess the collector, I forget exactly, the collector's over them, and for some reason he wants to divest himself of them.

29:27.518 --> 29:39.775
And he asked Cadillac Jack, and Cadillac Jack says something like, well, you know, I really don't know what I would do with them.

29:39.795 --> 29:42.379
And the collector would stare there and say, do with them?

29:42.940 --> 29:43.901
Why, you'd have them.

29:44.762 --> 29:55.037
And that idea of just wanting to possess, that's what I think a lot of collecting is about.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.120
Talk to me a little bit.

29:57.674 --> 30:05.044
Because I listened to you, John, and we mentioned you, and we'll be writing about him, can you just tell me a little bit about working with him to be, in fact, about him?

30:05.124 --> 30:06.286
Sure, yeah.

30:06.306 --> 30:10.632
I just wanted to add one little thing about this idea of collecting.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.218
What I like is not so much having a book.

30:15.238 --> 30:22.328
I mean, I have lots of books at home, and some of them, by chance, are rare.

30:22.348 --> 30:25.993
You know, maybe Larry McMurtry inscribed a book to me, which he did.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.562
And it's in my library.

30:27.722 --> 30:30.385
But it's not there because it's a rare book.

30:30.405 --> 30:32.127
It's a book that I had.

30:35.792 --> 30:41.078
But I like the idea not of having the book, but of providing it.

30:41.098 --> 30:45.143
Of saying, I had that book in that condition twice.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.587
So, yeah.

30:48.607 --> 30:50.390
Not I have, but I have had.

30:50.630 --> 30:52.352
And it's kind of a rationalization.

30:52.889 --> 30:58.074
I gather you get satisfaction then in helping other people build their collections?

30:58.094 --> 30:59.095
Oh, sure.

30:59.175 --> 30:59.376
Sure.

30:59.396 --> 31:07.384
I mean, that's kind of a vicarious... But I mean, the books physically may not be yours, but you have... Right.

31:07.404 --> 31:08.525
Well, you mentioned John.

31:09.386 --> 31:21.478
Now, I do take pride in having gained, to a certain degree, John's confidence

31:22.083 --> 31:28.389
and having been able to pass along, you know, books to him.

31:28.409 --> 31:33.593
And the way I met him was, you know, he came around to book fairs, very quietly.

31:33.693 --> 31:37.297
For two, three years, he might have even come up to Boston.

31:37.317 --> 31:38.738
You know, I know you were always up there.

31:38.758 --> 31:40.179
Yeah, I don't know what we're going to say.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.962
Well, but he used to come at least to the California fairs, yeah.

31:44.123 --> 31:48.366
I never came to Boston because Peter Stern told me that they took him out to lunch.

31:48.386 --> 31:51.229
He made a film there.

31:52.390 --> 31:57.838
And he might have asked me a question or two, and of course I noticed him.

31:57.878 --> 32:08.072
I didn't know who he was at the time, because I don't really have time for watching much regular TV programming.

32:10.916 --> 32:19.849
But, you know, I just recognized that this was somebody who was asking the right questions, even though he was a novelist.

32:20.842 --> 32:30.315
And I could see not only a genuine interest, but a kind of pragmatic intelligence.

32:31.576 --> 32:38.445
And then, after he started buying some books, I realized that he also had the ability to buy.

32:38.846 --> 32:40.628
And I need to confront him.

32:40.648 --> 32:41.910
And he certainly understands this collection.

32:42.711 --> 32:48.078
He does, and he's not driven to have every last book.

32:48.098 --> 32:50.241
He has patience.

32:50.997 --> 32:56.685
There's one book he wants, desperately, that's an inscribed copy of Endgame.

32:56.886 --> 32:57.747
I know that.

32:58.067 --> 32:59.630
He told me that.

32:59.650 --> 33:03.876
And that really is the whole, to me, this is what made him a collector when he was playing Ham.

33:04.276 --> 33:15.553
I mean, he started collecting Beckett because he was taking Beckett's writing and giving it life on the stage, which is a really very wonderful example for me as a collector.

33:16.141 --> 33:19.284
And you found that Beckett collection, which is wonderful.

33:19.304 --> 33:20.886
Could you describe it a little bit for me?

33:20.906 --> 33:22.588
It is an association collection.

33:22.608 --> 33:26.733
Well, it's a collection that is another collector built over a period of time.

33:26.833 --> 33:29.356
It wasn't complete, but it was pretty good.

33:29.376 --> 33:38.746
And then when we got it, we filled in some of the obvious holes, you know, because we do have contacts.

33:40.308 --> 33:45.253
But, you know, essentially, the nucleus of it was there.

33:46.027 --> 34:00.550
See, if you wanted to collect Beckett today, and you came to me with five or ten times the amount of money that, say, John paid for the collection, I couldn't produce those books.

34:01.031 --> 34:09.604
I mean, I probably could over a period of time, but it's not only having the money, but having the right copies available.

34:09.803 --> 34:12.146
at one time.

34:12.506 --> 34:15.089
It does, but also these things dry up.

34:15.209 --> 34:18.453
They disappear into institutional collections.

34:19.053 --> 34:20.575
How did this happen?

34:20.595 --> 34:25.861
Did you learn of a collection that was for sale and advise John of it?

34:26.462 --> 34:27.182
Well, first, no.

34:27.363 --> 34:32.749
I mean, first, you know, John was buying isolated Becker titles from us.

34:32.769 --> 34:39.456
And then, several years later, when I learned of the availability of the collection,

34:40.718 --> 34:45.304
I approached Sean and I said, I've got a chance to buy it.

34:45.324 --> 34:53.015
I would say that's a major, that actually makes his collection that particular element.

34:53.355 --> 35:05.572
Well, we put ourselves on the line a little, I must say, because I didn't know who was going to buy it, but I had to make a business decision on whether to bring the collection back here or not.

35:05.972 --> 35:06.393
And so I did.

35:06.413 --> 35:10.118
So you had the way I was going to buy it.

35:10.283 --> 35:11.924
Well, sure.

35:12.025 --> 35:25.036
That's part of the excitement, too, is for a bookseller to, I guess I can say it inelegantly, put his money where his mouth is.

35:25.056 --> 35:30.061
There are a number of booksellers in the ADAA who are very conservative.

35:30.321 --> 35:35.846
They will not buy a book unless they're 99% sure that they're going to sell it.

35:35.966 --> 35:39.970
In my mind, that's not the mark of a great bookseller.

35:40.270 --> 35:54.324
is the other end of the poll, the other poll, which is that booksellers who have no discrimination, which is buy, buy, buy, and they're always struggling, you know, with problems of cash flow.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.187
You have to kind of find a middle ground there.

35:59.250 --> 36:03.634
Yeah, can I cut a burden on everyone on September 13th?

36:03.654 --> 36:07.138
He's an example of, he's pretty quite unusual.

36:07.158 --> 36:07.959
He is.

36:08.219 --> 36:09.400
Well, I mean,

36:11.017 --> 36:14.100
the breadth of Carter's collection.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.541
89,000 volumes.

36:15.561 --> 36:17.002
Well, it's more than a number of volumes.

36:17.022 --> 36:24.509
I mean, what Carter set out to do is collect every book by every American author from, say, 1875 hours.

36:24.629 --> 36:31.154
You know, he realized after a while that that was too broad, I mean, way too broad.

36:31.635 --> 36:41.023
But he had the, I guess, the vision and the ambition to do that.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.008
And in means.

36:44.308 --> 36:55.022
And in the last few years, he has divested himself of some of his art collections, and he's sold several other collections to other dealers.

36:55.583 --> 37:00.730
But I think we've helped him dispose of half a dozen of his art collections.

37:02.072 --> 37:09.762
He gave all of his science fiction, you know, thousands and thousands of books to the Neopublic Library.

37:10.197 --> 37:12.500
on that level, I mean, you can do that.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.644
Well, it's probably a leading process written now.

37:15.804 --> 37:16.485
It's refinement.

37:16.545 --> 37:21.130
The mandate that you start with has to be, you have to have a course correction at some point.

37:21.150 --> 37:21.991
He ran out of room.

37:22.392 --> 37:23.333
Carter ran out of room.

37:24.434 --> 37:30.061
Okay, I will give you the quintessential movie image of a collector.

37:30.321 --> 37:33.926
And this is a true story, and I will not name the collector.

37:33.946 --> 37:39.192
But this is a collector in New York who collected on

37:39.678 --> 37:43.402
not quite the grand scale that Carter did, but very wealthy.

37:44.483 --> 37:56.715
And the money really came from his mother, who doled it out to him month by month because he's sort of an irresponsible kind of guy.

37:57.756 --> 38:06.545
And he was always buying books and paying for them at a slightly slower pace than he was taking them in.

38:07.105 --> 38:09.027
And when you got to his house,

38:09.766 --> 38:39.300
six rooms, seven rooms, there were books all over, you know, floor and ceiling shelves stacked up on the floor, in the bathroom, unopened packages, books that had come back from the slipcase makers, and his bed was a king-size bed, and it had on it, on this rectangle, books that were stacked maybe eight, ten eyes,

38:39.770 --> 38:43.394
And, I mean, how many books can you put on a bed before they tip over?

38:43.554 --> 38:44.596
You know, that kind of level.

38:45.156 --> 38:53.807
Except, over the whole bed, except for this little fetal-shaped area where he curled up.

38:54.427 --> 38:57.010
And he slept with his books.

38:57.031 --> 38:57.151
Right.

38:57.171 --> 39:01.155
He'd also gone through three or four wives.

39:01.175 --> 39:02.477
Just a practicing collector?

39:03.438 --> 39:05.200
Well, yeah.

39:05.220 --> 39:05.841
And in New York.

39:06.342 --> 39:06.722
And in New York.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.425
You know, we've got to go catch a 7 p.m.

39:10.445 --> 39:11.066
plane.

39:11.186 --> 39:14.110
Do you have any questions for us?

39:14.131 --> 39:16.314
It seems to be very helpful in the COU.

39:16.434 --> 39:21.803
Anyone there?

39:21.823 --> 39:22.384
Excellent.

39:22.404 --> 39:24.167
Yeah, I'm really glad we made the trip.

39:24.407 --> 39:30.136
We're talking about Margo.

39:30.257 --> 39:33.402
Yeah, but don't attribute this to me.

39:33.422 --> 39:35.545
What happened was that Heritage Board, they collection.

39:35.677 --> 39:36.178
heritage.

39:36.619 --> 39:38.602
And Maury bought that collection.

39:38.783 --> 39:41.708
I sort of told them about it.

39:41.728 --> 39:47.759
It was about 9,000 books, and it was like, you know, like typical booksellers went through.

39:48.500 --> 39:54.651
Here was a collection of 9,000 books bought by this little haberdasher in New Jersey named Norman Unger.

39:54.671 --> 39:56.875
They bought these books one at a time

39:57.428 --> 40:26.322
uh many times got them inscribed and then put them away you know 10 copies of naked in the dead 20 copies of catcher in the ride put them away in his basement for 40 years and uh 20 years died and then his heirs came to uh an auction and kept hearing heritage and approached lou and then after the book fair after the auction sold him the collection this was the hemiro collection no this was modern literature

40:27.365 --> 40:43.821
and uh and uh eventually i know i heard about it i guess through us and went down to l.a and bought the collection you know
