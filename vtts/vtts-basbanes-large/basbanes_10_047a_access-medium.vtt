WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.779
talking to Dr. Gregorian.

00:05.020 --> 00:06.282
Why don't we start?

00:06.302 --> 00:15.472
I love the essay that Philip Hamburger wrote about you for The New Yorker, which was republished, and I have it, and I've prepared.

00:16.193 --> 00:17.194
I've read it several times.

00:17.374 --> 00:18.936
I will probably even quote this.

00:19.937 --> 00:29.228
He uses a concluding paragraph of that piece as an epigraph to one of my chapters where he writes about going into the reading room, and he says...

00:29.950 --> 00:42.767
how the green lights, first of all, he tries to go onto the computer, and it says, help, and then he walks up into the room, and everything is quiet, and it's hushed, and he felt safe again, surrounded by these readers and by these books.

00:43.147 --> 00:43.688
I love that.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.531
I love that piece.

00:45.931 --> 00:58.067
You said in that piece that when you, and really, I don't intend this to be a conversation about your years necessarily at the New York Public Library, but I think it is pertinent to quote there where you say,

00:58.385 --> 01:06.035
You suggest that you arrive in New York, you're in the right place at the right time to help that institution through a period.

01:07.176 --> 01:11.322
I suspect you probably would feel the same way about your years here at Brown.

01:11.342 --> 01:14.566
No, that was completely different.

01:14.586 --> 01:16.148
Okay.

01:16.168 --> 01:23.297
New York Public Library was taken for granted by New Yorkers.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.540
Therefore, it's declined in many ways.

01:27.427 --> 01:31.232
was considered as part of general decline of New York.

01:35.758 --> 01:46.212
So when I arrived in New York, I had no notion of the libraries and their plight and their centrality.

01:46.312 --> 01:49.757
I knew library was important.

01:49.777 --> 01:55.965
I'd spend all my academic life in California, in Texas,

01:56.603 --> 02:26.458
Pennsylvania the university librarian reported to me I knew about issues of the libraries always in relation to the university if you could not get a book we could get it through loan program and so forth so that there was nothing that would prevent your research I could send you to Moscow

02:26.607 --> 02:27.728
because I had no books.

02:28.629 --> 02:30.051
You could take a sabbatical.

02:30.671 --> 02:36.557
Many universities could cope with their deficiencies.

02:36.577 --> 02:37.398
They could cope.

02:37.518 --> 02:38.019
They can.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.180
They can.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.242
Because if you don't have it, you can get from somewhere else.

02:42.804 --> 02:52.314
The issue of New York Public Library, which I did not realize when I took over, was that it was, in a sense, what I mentioned in the article.

02:53.275 --> 02:55.197
It's a university of universities.

02:56.948 --> 03:04.337
It was a kind of central edifice of cultural life of New York.

03:05.998 --> 03:08.521
And if you did not have, you could not get from somewhere else.

03:11.144 --> 03:11.585
Period.

03:13.347 --> 03:21.857
Because public libraries were always conceived to be the equalizers in our culture.

03:21.877 --> 03:25.000
Two institutions were considered very important.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.382
Most public school systems.

03:27.138 --> 03:28.901
to give you a chance.

03:28.921 --> 03:36.612
The other one, to give you a chance throughout your entire life, was New York Public Library.

03:36.632 --> 03:54.377
So when I assumed the role of president, my first meeting on Wall Street with the trustees of New York Public Library, which by the way, I was late 40 minutes because the Russian driver did not know Wall Street.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.002
They know where it is now, don't they?

03:58.022 --> 03:58.883
They know now.

03:58.903 --> 04:16.420
But anyway, my first meeting with the board, on the agenda was how to sell collections, how to shut down some of the branches.

04:16.660 --> 04:17.941
How to sell collections?

04:19.482 --> 04:19.583
Yeah.

04:19.623 --> 04:23.787
That's a major concern of this new book, by the way, too, the deaccessioning of it.

04:23.807 --> 04:25.208
How to sell collections.

04:29.440 --> 04:45.745
some collections valuable, how to charge for use, and how to shut down some of the branches, and how to curtail the hours.

04:47.828 --> 04:48.089
Wow.

04:49.310 --> 04:57.523
The ad that was meant to appeal to New Yorkers was a big ad in the New York Times

04:57.908 --> 05:05.275
that if New York Public Library did not exist, there were a big parking place in mid-Malhattan.

05:05.295 --> 05:17.926
So my notion was that people won't assist a dying institution.

05:18.607 --> 05:20.369
They will not assist.

05:20.769 --> 05:25.774
They will pay for a funeral cost for old time's sake.

05:25.794 --> 05:27.375
But they will not assist a dying institution.

05:28.992 --> 05:40.665
So, what I considered when I came to New York, that that is not a question, cannot even put a matter of question.

05:40.705 --> 05:42.407
New York Public Library has to survive.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.010
Not an option in New York?

05:45.050 --> 05:48.854
Not an option at all.

05:49.354 --> 05:50.816
So don't even talk about it.

05:52.057 --> 05:58.965
You have to stress how central it is, how crucial it is, and how wonderful it is.

06:00.329 --> 06:06.036
Because New York Public Library had one thing that most libraries do not.

06:06.056 --> 06:16.750
That was truly, in my opinion, and was popularized after I mentioned by Nolan Mailer and others, people's palace.

06:17.831 --> 06:20.775
People's palace.

06:20.795 --> 06:22.157
It was built with marble.

06:23.278 --> 06:24.500
It was built to last.

06:25.982 --> 06:27.584
Because culture had to last.

06:28.645 --> 06:29.526
Knowledge had to last.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.518
But it also had something else, which most libraries do not have.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.102
You did not have to give your identity.

06:39.104 --> 06:43.408
Nobody checked your driver's license.

06:45.450 --> 06:50.195
You could give your name as Karl Marx or Freud.

06:50.215 --> 06:55.800
And the other thing is, your privacy, which impressed me.

06:58.396 --> 07:01.260
This is not unique, however, to the New York Public Library.

07:01.340 --> 07:02.541
I mean, or is it?

07:03.002 --> 07:03.322
It is.

07:05.165 --> 07:05.485
It is.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.071
In many ways, other libraries, you need a car to use.

07:11.312 --> 07:13.375
You don't need a car at the New York Public Library?

07:14.236 --> 07:23.728
You walk in from the street, go directly to the manuscript division, go to the genealogy, says, I'd like to see.

07:25.042 --> 07:26.464
A gentle madness.

07:26.504 --> 07:27.705
That explains why.

07:27.725 --> 07:32.411
Because I collect library cards, and I tried to apply for one there, and they said, well, you don't need one.

07:32.491 --> 07:35.855
And I thought, well, maybe they were just being nice to me.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.036
I guess it's policy.

07:37.076 --> 07:37.997
I didn't realize that.

07:38.578 --> 07:40.440
Branch libraries need for circulation.

07:41.301 --> 07:44.565
But at a search library, you don't need a card.

07:44.585 --> 07:52.174
As a matter of fact, my first time when I arrived in New York, I went to New York Public Library, Slavic Division.

07:52.194 --> 07:54.357
And nobody asked me for a card, and I told them.

07:56.227 --> 07:57.288
I was there illegally.

07:57.629 --> 07:58.090
I left.

08:00.293 --> 08:06.341
Birch Museum, Bibliotheque Nationale, you need a card, an ID, a picture of everything.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.663
Not that in your public library.

08:09.786 --> 08:10.286
Wonderful.

08:10.387 --> 08:21.542
Second, we have a law that you don't circulate what has been circulated.

08:23.564 --> 08:28.349
information about circulation of circulated books to individuals for a century.

08:30.992 --> 08:34.635
Somebody wants to come and ask us, what did you read?

08:34.695 --> 08:37.338
None of their business.

08:37.358 --> 08:39.300
No, that's very sacred material.

08:40.241 --> 08:43.324
That's like talking to somebody's psychiatrist.

08:43.805 --> 08:47.749
Well, that's also, so it impressed me very much.

08:47.789 --> 08:51.192
But anyway, to answer your direct question,

08:52.707 --> 09:02.779
I had a thought that the cause was so valuable that if you succeed, it would be a miracle.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.224
If you failed, it would be a great march return.

09:07.244 --> 09:10.268
Either way, you could not lose it.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.650
What accounts for it?

09:11.750 --> 09:14.012
I mean, that library opened in 1911.

09:14.193 --> 09:15.654
This was 1981.

09:15.674 --> 09:16.435
Seventy years.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.958
Was there a decline in our culture?

09:19.038 --> 09:22.022
I mean, did we no longer... No decline.

09:22.357 --> 09:32.850
First of all, great confusion by the term of public.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.912
New York Public Library is a private library.

09:36.394 --> 09:40.479
Which I made clear in this book, and I'm going to make even more clear in the next book.

09:40.499 --> 09:47.748
Public is used in 19th century sense, British sense, open.

09:47.768 --> 09:51.553
Public now is tax supported.

09:53.018 --> 09:55.101
So that was one thing.

09:55.121 --> 09:55.883
Great confusion.

09:56.984 --> 10:03.735
Second is, it did not have a plan to receive gifts other than books.

10:03.755 --> 10:11.127
It would receive books, archives, but no money to maintain it.

10:14.232 --> 10:16.696
And also cities declined in the 70s.

10:16.716 --> 10:20.562
It was linked to New York Public Library's decline.

10:23.157 --> 10:27.843
Basically, for politicians, everything you cut across the board.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.351
That's an easy way to do it.

10:33.852 --> 10:36.175
Everybody lost it.

10:36.195 --> 10:50.715
But some of the library cuts and so forth were historically very regressive because you cannot catch up periods you did not build, you did not collect, you did not catalog, and so forth.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.337
And also,

10:53.903 --> 11:05.159
The story of New York Public Library, as you well know, was that the building was built by the city at a cost of 11 million dollars in 1911.

11:05.279 --> 11:14.391
There is not a single piece of non-marble in that building.

11:14.411 --> 11:20.620
But it was built with the agreement that the city will build the edifice,

11:21.545 --> 11:24.709
Astor, Lennox, and Tilden will bring their collections there.

11:26.531 --> 11:36.464
And City will maintain the building, and independent board will keep the collections.

11:36.484 --> 11:39.067
So it was public-private partnership.

11:40.169 --> 11:44.374
As one part suffered, the public, the rest suffered.

11:46.417 --> 11:49.881
And also the boards, usually.

11:52.544 --> 11:58.212
I had a different notion about being a trustee in your public life.

11:58.232 --> 12:03.039
In 1927, the world has one of the greatest cartoons, Feeding the Lions.

12:04.100 --> 12:15.056
JP Morgan, Rockefeller, who else, Vanderbilt, all of them have one million dollars putting in the mouth of the lions.

12:15.997 --> 12:18.361
You mean patient support to the lions?

12:18.461 --> 12:21.004
Yes, they're feeding, million dollars.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.146
Because to be trustee,

12:22.531 --> 12:26.796
it meant you covered the deficit from your own pocket.

12:26.816 --> 12:31.921
There was no fundraising, no public involvement.

12:31.941 --> 12:48.960
So as a result, in 1980, by 1980, when I arrived, there was an article in the New York Times, actually, that New York Public Library

12:51.337 --> 13:06.558
face $50 million deficit, and that it will have no endowment left, therefore it had to sell collections and so forth.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.245
Did they prioritize the collection that they were going to sell?

13:11.465 --> 13:12.466
Yes, collections.

13:12.707 --> 13:14.169
Well, I mean, Audubon.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.795
What was your reaction to that?

13:19.788 --> 13:24.613
My reaction was simply, you don't oppose things when you're first meeting.

13:25.134 --> 13:27.716
You say, let's study, come up with.

13:27.736 --> 13:34.343
First reaction was that New York Public Library does not need class.

13:34.844 --> 13:35.625
It has class.

13:35.645 --> 13:36.946
It gives class to people.

13:39.208 --> 13:45.275
So that it should be an honor to belong to this board, its most classy board.

13:46.136 --> 13:47.297
So you're dealing with learning,

13:47.598 --> 13:51.824
In many ways, you're also dealing with two issues, elitism and populism.

13:52.805 --> 13:55.348
Elitism and populism?

13:55.449 --> 14:02.238
Good for ordinary people, as well as for writers, scientists, and so forth.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.363
Some of the great inventions were done at the New York Public Library.

14:07.425 --> 14:11.190
Polaroid was developed there.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.112
By using the materials that were there?

14:13.132 --> 14:14.314
The technology did.

14:15.003 --> 14:17.246
You talk about the treasures that are there, right?

14:17.386 --> 14:18.868
Ready to be... Ready.

14:18.888 --> 14:23.134
I mean, you don't know who's working at what and where.

14:23.735 --> 14:26.178
So, that it's central.

14:27.079 --> 14:28.441
Failure is not an option.

14:28.621 --> 14:30.344
That was the issue.

14:30.364 --> 14:39.456
So then, my timing, the reason you quote that was right, because it had reached rock bottom in many ways.

14:41.198 --> 14:44.082
The exhibition hall was...

14:44.737 --> 14:46.079
for accounting offices.

14:46.179 --> 14:48.762
They partitioned that with partitions.

14:50.084 --> 14:54.910
Bartos Forum was for storage.

14:55.911 --> 14:58.114
I gave a talk there two years ago.

14:58.154 --> 14:58.675
Storage.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.880
Storage.

15:02.900 --> 15:13.073
And public donations, their ambition was to ask $35 from each donor.

15:14.082 --> 15:15.343
just to keep up where they were.

15:16.344 --> 15:20.929
So first option was to make failure a non-option.

15:20.949 --> 15:32.662
Second one was to bring the rich and the mighty into an alliance with educators and intelligentsia.

15:32.682 --> 15:36.687
It was very crucial.

15:37.488 --> 15:39.750
And there Mrs. Astor was instrumental.

15:40.651 --> 15:43.414
And Richard Solomon, who was former

15:44.002 --> 15:45.163
head of Charles de Ritz.

15:48.166 --> 15:56.214
He brought Philanthropes, and Andrew Heiskel, former head of Time Life.

15:56.234 --> 16:07.384
So there's a great combination between private philanthropy, business, corporate, and intelligentsia.

16:10.047 --> 16:13.350
Then, of course, you have to bring the mayor another woman.

16:13.735 --> 16:15.116
city council and so forth.

16:15.937 --> 16:25.045
But because it was public, the branch libraries had not to be neglected, because that's where the political muscle was.

16:25.565 --> 16:34.673
So we build a tremendous political and intellectual and social power on behalf of the New York Public Library.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.856
The first act was to clean the building.

16:37.876 --> 16:39.277
People will see what they had.

16:40.838 --> 16:43.000
And then second, extend the hours.

16:43.705 --> 16:48.951
their collections, bring air conditioning to the whole library, preservation.

16:50.192 --> 16:51.674
Actually, a lot.

16:53.396 --> 17:05.369
As a matter of fact, I have something up here.

17:06.530 --> 17:12.497
I was mentioning the fact that

17:13.186 --> 17:17.610
the timing was right because that hit button.

17:17.951 --> 17:20.793
And then the combination of forces were right.

17:22.395 --> 17:27.079
And also the very fact that I did not know its limitations.

17:29.121 --> 17:33.065
Had I been here, I would have seen constraints.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.868
Coming from outside, I only saw its possibilities.

17:37.729 --> 17:38.630
So that's the other way.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.573
Here, of course,

17:42.346 --> 17:51.018
We came, and this is relevant, according to the New York Times, you built the library from 2 million to 3 million books.

17:51.078 --> 18:05.637
At a time, may I say, when I see, and I've been traveling extensively for this new book, one of your sister schools in the Ivy League tells me, Cornell, that they are under a mandate from their trustees,

18:06.477 --> 18:14.325
to reduce their collections from 6.8 million to 6 million on campus by the year 2000, and all that that might involve.

18:15.126 --> 18:20.231
And I say, why can't you put the overflowing, but you own all the land between here and Syracuse.

18:20.251 --> 18:22.113
You know, do what Harvard does.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.254
Deposit for you.

18:23.274 --> 18:25.937
But that's not the direction they're going in.

18:26.137 --> 18:30.882
I mean, they have wonderful collections, but they're more interested in the digital stuff,

18:31.199 --> 18:36.787
and they're working, they're cutting edge, they're doing all kinds of things with Eastman Kodak and with Xerox.

18:37.468 --> 18:41.254
I spent two days up there just looking at the technology that they did.

18:41.594 --> 19:01.003
You, on the other hand, and the hamburger piece, and I'm sure that in the essays that you're going to give me, you profess a great respect for technology, for the computer, and for what it can offer, but I sense in you a deep, abiding, a non-negotiable respect and love

19:01.439 --> 19:07.190
Do you say libraries are sacred places and books are sacred objects?

19:08.472 --> 19:09.514
I don't know.

19:09.554 --> 19:12.259
I guess that's a question in a way.

19:15.044 --> 19:20.815
Well, I don't want to repeat what you read, but basically I believe that

19:21.503 --> 19:23.706
Libraries are not centers of information.

19:23.867 --> 19:24.287
Thank you.

19:24.307 --> 19:25.209
It's a question here.

19:25.469 --> 19:27.773
I mean, because they're changing the names of these places.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.697
The University of Michigan just opened a brand new facility.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.160
I've already forgotten what they call it.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.281
Information center.

19:34.263 --> 19:35.685
They're not centers of information.

19:35.705 --> 19:36.827
They're centers of learning.

19:38.389 --> 19:44.339
And there's a difference between getting information in your room.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.405
You can get it on your computer terminal, information.

19:49.482 --> 19:50.523
There's difference between that.

19:50.563 --> 19:53.747
There's difference between reading, which I contemplate back.

19:55.168 --> 20:01.696
It's almost like you can get a video and watch something at home.

20:02.577 --> 20:06.381
It's not the same thing that when you would sit with 800 people.

20:07.783 --> 20:11.507
It's a collective participation in a movie.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.110
Videos have not eliminated movies.

20:16.032 --> 20:17.093
In the same way, I don't think

20:18.136 --> 20:20.540
computers are going to eliminate libraries.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.604
Libraries are cultural institutions.

20:25.267 --> 20:31.856
If you have a chance, whenever you go to New York, go to Barnes and Noble.

20:35.622 --> 20:37.244
Chant with people till midnight.

20:38.266 --> 20:40.049
People sitting, reading there and so forth.

20:40.329 --> 20:41.030
Cappuccino.

20:41.551 --> 20:43.454
Cappuccino, this and so forth.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.797
I read in yesterday's time, somebody

20:46.182 --> 20:52.129
said that he had read the entire Dostoyevsky, just sitting there to see whether somebody would say leave.

20:52.770 --> 20:55.213
Nobody would say leave.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.515
They know what it's about.

20:59.938 --> 21:02.000
The terminals there are used to find the books.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.826
They don't say, come to Barnes and Noah get some information.

21:10.050 --> 21:14.535
And I believe also there's going to be peaceful coexistence between the book

21:15.325 --> 21:23.212
which is not only, it's a historical artifact, the book, not just containable information.

21:24.253 --> 21:35.364
And as you see in this essay, which I'll give you, that I say, there is a dialectical interplay between the author and the book.

21:36.725 --> 21:42.210
Yeah, each author, we have

21:43.000 --> 21:48.947
Each author has responsibility to readers, and readers have responsibilities to the authors.

21:50.449 --> 21:53.072
A book started by author is finished by a reader.

21:54.053 --> 22:02.343
And the other thing I say in this essay, that you have to be a re-reader, not just reader, to re-read.

22:04.024 --> 22:05.446
Information does not do that.

22:07.128 --> 22:11.353
Because reading is a kind of, I conceive to be, the last

22:11.840 --> 22:13.321
private act left.

22:14.322 --> 22:16.925
The cultural act.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.226
The cultural act.

22:18.967 --> 22:31.439
And so the book I consider also historical artifacts and at the same time... Thank you.

22:31.559 --> 22:38.286
I'm looking for everyone.

22:38.620 --> 22:43.867
Yeah, look under Franklin Murphy and Huntington Library.

22:43.927 --> 22:50.935
This was a place elsewhere, reading in the age of the computer.

22:50.956 --> 22:53.919
Oh, wonderful.

22:53.939 --> 23:05.233
And it is the debate between this one or divided knowledge.

23:05.253 --> 23:05.454
Excellent.

23:05.474 --> 23:05.674
Excellent.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.441
I just got back from Toronto.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.722
I spent three days up there.

23:18.805 --> 23:21.929
The University of Toronto, which is 10 million volume.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.152
And it's very interesting.

23:24.212 --> 23:27.417
I'd never thought of it in this context before.

23:28.678 --> 23:33.845
And it's almost paradoxical with the way you see... Some of these are repetitive, but you'll forgive me.

23:33.865 --> 23:34.887
Oh, I like repetition.

23:34.907 --> 23:39.473
And this is... Oh, good, yeah.

23:39.493 --> 23:40.234
Oh, this is terrific.

23:41.429 --> 23:43.511
This is all the things done in eight years.

23:46.113 --> 23:50.417
Lecture series, exhibitions.

23:50.837 --> 23:52.359
Excellent.

23:52.379 --> 23:52.579
Thank you.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.822
And I'm not trying to, as I said, I am looking for insights.

23:55.842 --> 23:58.864
If it's at all possible, I know we've only got an hour today.

23:58.884 --> 24:00.646
Do you think... No, we can get together again.

24:00.666 --> 24:02.667
Can we get together again, either here or in New York?

24:03.068 --> 24:04.009
Sure.

24:04.129 --> 24:05.530
Or in the library.

24:05.690 --> 24:06.651
Yeah, I think so.

24:06.691 --> 24:09.914
Because I think you can see that this is going to be a very good book.

24:09.934 --> 24:11.335
Very exciting book.

24:12.479 --> 24:13.621
Where was I going?

24:13.821 --> 24:16.465
Toronto, for instance, 10 million volumes.

24:16.505 --> 24:18.167
This decision was made in the 1950s.

24:18.308 --> 24:24.136
If you're going to be regarded as a great institution, then you have to have a measurable collection.

24:24.156 --> 24:25.158
Do you agree with that?

24:25.238 --> 24:25.498
Yes.

24:25.538 --> 24:27.161
Books as objects matter.

24:27.281 --> 24:33.189
I consider, you will read there, great universities are known by great libraries.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.852
They're liabilities.

24:34.872 --> 24:40.360
Now, one problem that will be emerging, and there is a

24:40.711 --> 24:43.974
document, if you can make a note and ask me, I'll send it to you.

24:44.655 --> 24:50.800
One of my colleagues here, Brian Hawkins, is an expert on this.

24:52.061 --> 25:03.432
By the year 2003 or 2005, all of our monies of research libraries will be able to buy 5% of available material.

25:06.114 --> 25:09.537
So that is going to necessitate a great deal of cooperation.

25:12.352 --> 25:13.614
5% of what you need.

25:13.734 --> 25:14.294
Is that what you mean?

25:14.715 --> 25:18.339
What is available, not what you need.

25:18.359 --> 25:25.668
Let's say every year, Frankfurt Book Fair, 850,000 titles alone.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.675
So we cannot afford to buy.

25:31.936 --> 25:33.678
But you would want all 850,000.

25:33.738 --> 25:34.619
No, but you will not.

25:34.659 --> 25:42.088
But how you select it, why you select what you select, is going to be a key issue.

25:42.777 --> 25:55.829
You see, as a Times piece, I'm really impressed by your going from two million to three million, but I'm equally as interested in how you decided which million, which books you chose.

25:56.310 --> 26:03.556
I heard a cute story while I was in Toronto, the University of New York, which was established in the 60s, and they had no books.

26:04.037 --> 26:09.722
So their first act was to go to Star Bookstore in Boston and buy out every book in this.

26:09.742 --> 26:10.523
It's a true story.

26:10.790 --> 26:17.878
buy out every book in the secondhand bookstore here, and then go to Montreal and buy out all the books in Ducharme's store.

26:17.899 --> 26:19.821
And that was the seed for life.

26:19.981 --> 26:23.465
But it's kind of funny, but we're easy.

26:23.906 --> 26:24.767
Somewhere to begin.

26:24.807 --> 26:29.552
Selectivity, as you read in there, selectivity is the biggest issue.

26:29.793 --> 26:32.356
Of course, and that anticipates my question.

26:32.376 --> 26:38.383
So you must have come, not only are we going to strengthen the collections, but clearly we have to

26:38.937 --> 26:41.020
have a strategy in place.

26:41.040 --> 26:52.856
Yeah, the strategy usually is, in sciences, you rely mostly on journals which are antiquated in a couple of years.

26:53.777 --> 26:59.805
So one of the possibilities you're going to have in the future, that most scientific publication would be electronic.

27:00.025 --> 27:00.726
And that makes sense.

27:01.527 --> 27:03.570
Because who wants to read?

27:03.610 --> 27:08.877
There are 850,000 titles in chemistry alone that come up every year.

27:10.426 --> 27:15.653
Well, you don't have to have all of them here.

27:15.673 --> 27:21.720
Basically, the humanities and social sciences and history of science, those are the areas.

27:22.641 --> 27:34.336
And there, the problem is how you decide where to concentrate.

27:35.397 --> 27:39.302
Because the problem that we did not have in

27:40.936 --> 27:43.538
16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.702
There was one notion of world civilization.

27:47.962 --> 27:49.183
Everybody contributed to that.

27:49.904 --> 27:51.145
So we could use progress.

27:51.245 --> 27:52.606
This was the prevailing notion?

27:52.626 --> 27:55.008
The prevailing notion was that it was civilization.

27:55.729 --> 27:56.830
It was a civilized people.

27:57.751 --> 27:57.971
Why?

27:58.011 --> 28:01.134
Because there was some agreement as to what constitutes civilization.

28:02.315 --> 28:10.622
So, in my book, the biggest purveyors and

28:11.328 --> 28:13.510
disseminators of Western civilization.

28:14.912 --> 28:26.002
Having Mao Zedong, you know, take Karl Marx, Hegel, Ricardo, Shakespeare, all over into China.

28:27.184 --> 28:27.604
Imagine.

28:28.965 --> 28:36.913
Because there was notion that we've gone through primeval and medieval feudal

28:37.315 --> 28:41.221
bourgeois capitalist or proletarian revolution, there's progress.

28:42.122 --> 28:45.887
And whoever had contributed progressive phase, you studied those.

28:45.927 --> 28:48.611
So that was one criteria, you could choose books and so forth.

28:50.073 --> 28:55.381
Shakespeare happens to be progressive, so Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, all of them.

28:56.583 --> 28:57.785
So Shakespeare is great.

28:57.885 --> 29:07.018
As a matter of fact, you can measure the years of great repression in Russia, Soviet Union, by saying which are years that many Shakespeare's

29:07.201 --> 29:08.542
texts were published in Russia.

29:10.084 --> 29:16.371
Because many authors and so forth, when they could not write, they became translators of Shakespeare.

29:16.391 --> 29:18.053
Translator of Shakespeare.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.716
That's why they have such a wonderful edition of Shakespeare.

29:20.736 --> 29:20.916
Exactly.

29:20.956 --> 29:27.563
That's the indication that 1937 is a great year of Shakespeare in Russia.

29:28.364 --> 29:32.449
Because you get a new translation.

29:32.469 --> 29:32.749
Yeah.

29:33.049 --> 29:34.050
This is not the one.

29:34.070 --> 29:35.672
There was a book for

29:36.226 --> 29:38.009
This is the same thing.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.332
There was a book, do you remember?

29:40.633 --> 29:42.937
Small Technology and so forth, and Getty.

29:44.559 --> 29:46.422
This summarizes it.

29:48.465 --> 29:50.769
This is it.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.353
This is great.

29:54.375 --> 30:01.205
I'm sorry, you were... And Brian Hawkins, I should... Brian Hawkins has a paper, which I'll send it to you.

30:01.285 --> 30:02.908
It says exactly...

30:03.260 --> 30:14.712
One of the first, I also, in the Times piece, that you also commissioned a study by one of your deans to indicate what students read, is that right?

30:14.952 --> 30:15.953
Was that helpful to you?

30:16.474 --> 30:19.957
Well, what students take, what kind of courses they take.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.322
You know?

30:24.342 --> 30:28.506
Because I didn't, whatever he says, students are encouraged to take.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.628
I said, that's not enough.

30:30.648 --> 30:32.170
Let's go transcript by transcript.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.289
what courses our students take.

30:36.931 --> 30:43.678
So you would know whether you're following genre of fiction or reality.

30:44.980 --> 30:49.204
But that was not determining a source of buying books and so forth, but rather seeing trends.

30:49.985 --> 30:51.827
How about, was Shakespeare popular?

30:52.488 --> 30:54.890
Who else?

30:54.910 --> 31:02.578
If I were to tell you that, and this is just something that I was told, that Amherst College, for instance, two or three years ago,

31:03.554 --> 31:13.729
gave a summa cum laude to an English major who had never taken a course in Shakespeare, had never been required to study Chaucer, Milton, or Spencer.

31:13.789 --> 31:21.820
Now, I don't know whether or not this individual is familiar with these writers, but he got a degree in English literature, graduated summa.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.763
Yeah, without going to foundations.

31:24.063 --> 31:25.245
What's your response to that?

31:25.425 --> 31:27.949
My response, that's very unlikely.

31:28.710 --> 31:30.292
It's an exception rather than the rule.

31:31.274 --> 31:33.477
For one very simple reason.

31:34.992 --> 31:41.702
When you deal with Brown, we have 15,000 applicants for 1,350 places.

31:41.722 --> 31:42.724
1,350.

31:44.727 --> 31:49.014
So 2,000, 3,000 valedictorians have applied.

31:49.034 --> 31:52.119
2,000 valedictorians.

31:52.139 --> 31:53.561
Top 1% of class have applied.

31:54.382 --> 32:02.755
From schools where they already have 1,450 SATs, 1,350, straight A, and they're achievers.

32:04.304 --> 32:07.949
So they come from prep schools when you have to read Shakespeare.

32:09.270 --> 32:12.815
They come from public good high schools when they have to read Shakespeare and so forth.

32:13.936 --> 32:19.082
The issue is whether or not they take advanced courses or not.

32:19.102 --> 32:22.827
So it's slightly misleading if you compare all the universities.

32:22.907 --> 32:28.554
And I will bet this individual in Amherst was undoubtedly... I do not know.

32:28.574 --> 32:29.015
I don't know.

32:29.035 --> 32:29.956
I intend to find out.

32:29.976 --> 32:30.877
Whether he had taken.

32:30.937 --> 32:32.539
Whether he had taken.

32:32.806 --> 32:38.311
At the same time, what you have... That's more a philosophical question.

32:38.411 --> 32:39.352
You know where I'm going.

32:39.372 --> 32:40.553
You know what's happening.

32:40.794 --> 32:46.679
As you see about the fragmentation of knowledge, which I deal with.

32:46.839 --> 33:00.212
Actually, I wish I had known I would have sent all of this to you, because I'm covering all of this poorly by jumping from one topic to the other.

33:00.272 --> 33:01.193
But the good thing is,

33:01.527 --> 33:05.991
If you'll see me again, I'll have a chance to transcribe this tape.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.253
You don't have to transcribe.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.854
You just read these ones.

33:11.136 --> 33:14.900
Eighty percent of your questions are there, answers.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.802
Then we'll have another set of questions.

33:16.822 --> 33:19.084
And then you begin, as Portman is saying.

33:19.264 --> 33:19.645
Yes, yes.

33:19.745 --> 33:21.346
Then we can begin.

33:23.429 --> 33:27.633
I'm sorry, I had a... Well, now you're going to the Carnegie Corporation.

33:28.113 --> 33:30.015
And, of course, the beginning...

33:30.400 --> 33:34.987
That noble exercise began with the formation of libraries.

33:35.688 --> 33:39.754
Well, it became something more than that.

33:41.477 --> 33:48.086
Carnegie Foundation Corporation was created in 1911 by Andrew Carnegie.

33:48.146 --> 33:49.569
It's been years.

33:49.589 --> 33:50.550
Andrew Carnegie.

33:52.713 --> 33:59.243
Ironically, of the second foreign-born president of Carnegie,

33:59.594 --> 34:01.716
The first one being Carnegie himself.

34:03.358 --> 34:07.683
But basically he had two notions, the reason it began before that.

34:08.344 --> 34:19.296
First he believed in the notion, a very revolutionary one at the time, that public wealth, that capitalists are trustees of public wealth.

34:22.039 --> 34:25.623
That wealth was given to you, not to your family.

34:25.643 --> 34:27.745
That you earned it through your endeavor.

34:28.687 --> 34:31.071
And therefore, he had an obligation to give it back.

34:33.875 --> 34:37.682
So Carnegie thought that he had to give back.

34:40.065 --> 34:44.232
And by that, therefore, he created libraries.

34:45.895 --> 34:56.432
As a matter of fact, he is the one who told the city of New York that I'll give you X number of libraries, provided those libraries are run and operated.

34:58.285 --> 35:01.728
by the Independent Board, the New York Public Library Board.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.590
Very precious, isn't it, really?

35:05.412 --> 35:13.120
So that's where you can have, not the city bureaucracy, but the Independent Board governing, and city providing support.

35:13.741 --> 35:17.024
But Carnegie forgot something, inflation.

35:18.465 --> 35:20.487
It would be provided amply for all of them.

35:21.068 --> 35:22.049
So that was one thing.

35:22.249 --> 35:23.691
Henry Huntington, the same thing.

35:23.731 --> 35:25.432
The Morgan, the same thing.

35:25.553 --> 35:27.114
They thought they were set forever.

35:27.154 --> 35:27.955
They set forever.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.641
They did not.

35:30.661 --> 35:38.373
And the other one that Carnegie did, education, public learning.

35:39.515 --> 35:44.803
And the third one was international conflict.

35:44.823 --> 35:52.195
Actually, there is a Russian counterpart to Carnegie, who did not blossom as much as Carnegie.

35:52.756 --> 35:55.360
His name was Ivan Blyok.

35:55.745 --> 35:59.269
I'm going to have a chapter in Eastern European library.

35:59.749 --> 36:00.390
Ivan Blyok.

36:00.570 --> 36:01.952
How do we spell his name?

36:01.972 --> 36:02.873
Ivan, Ivan.

36:02.993 --> 36:03.934
Ivan, of course, yeah.

36:03.994 --> 36:06.136
Blyok.

36:06.156 --> 36:10.060
B-A-I-O-C-H, Blyok, I guess.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.442
The Russian counterpart.

36:11.462 --> 36:15.045
Yeah, he was the Tsar of railway system and industries in Russia.

36:15.546 --> 36:18.029
He was also a pacifist.

36:18.049 --> 36:23.254
He also, he forecast the exact cost of World War I. Really?

36:24.112 --> 36:25.594
That would be catastrophic.

36:25.614 --> 36:28.598
A capitalist has no excuse for war.

36:28.839 --> 36:30.201
There's plenty for everyone.

36:31.102 --> 36:35.027
Science will think people, technology will think people.

36:35.188 --> 36:43.219
But Kardec believed in libraries, in schools, and learning, and international conflict resolution.

36:49.027 --> 36:53.173
So Kardec's main trust is now

36:53.980 --> 37:05.091
education and resolutions of international conflict.

37:05.111 --> 37:11.557
But do you foresee or would you hope, and again, you haven't even begun the job yet.

37:11.577 --> 37:16.622
We're sitting here in March and we still have enough seven, eight months to go here.

37:16.642 --> 37:22.047
But do you think that it would be within the scope of Carnegie's agenda to return to

37:22.297 --> 37:33.069
Well, I do not know yet because I have to see what they're doing, why they're doing, how they're doing, and then set new priorities.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.716
So we have to see.

37:38.736 --> 37:43.701
I always study institution before I embark on change.

37:44.202 --> 37:45.283
That's the key phrase.

37:45.517 --> 37:48.481
as you've already articulated for these last two.

37:48.501 --> 37:53.288
By the way, before I forget, there's a chapter in here on the HRC at the University of Texas.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.490
Yeah.

37:54.510 --> 37:55.531
I'm very familiar with it.

37:55.671 --> 37:56.492
I was in Texas.

37:57.013 --> 37:57.474
I know that.

37:57.534 --> 38:02.621
That's why I mentioned, when I was going through your biography, I said, my God, maybe I should have talked to you when I was doing this.

38:02.641 --> 38:03.783
It's a wonderful chapter.

38:03.823 --> 38:11.033
It tells, more than ever has been published, just about how Harry Ransom and... I knew him well, Harry Ransom.

38:11.053 --> 38:14.017
John Silber talked to me.

38:14.037 --> 38:14.157
Yeah.

38:14.828 --> 38:18.371
and ceremoniously sent out his way in 1971.

38:18.472 --> 38:21.935
It was almost like he was waiting to talk to me after, you know.

38:22.255 --> 38:23.236
You talked to him?

38:23.256 --> 38:25.719
Oh yeah, I had a long interview with him there.

38:25.739 --> 38:27.801
It's in the chapter called Instant Ivy.

38:27.821 --> 38:29.342
I call it Instant Ivy.

38:29.362 --> 38:39.532
Well, the basic thing there, I'm sure you've covered it, Harry Ransom's genius was to consider books as a capital project.

38:41.074 --> 38:44.397
Because Texas, the reason Harry Ransom was successful,

38:44.866 --> 38:46.828
was not for his love of books and so forth.

38:48.310 --> 38:59.383
University of Texas system, entire higher education system, is dependent on available funds, which is the product of oil money.

39:00.825 --> 39:04.309
Because initially, University of Texas was downtown.

39:04.950 --> 39:11.899
I mean, they kicked it out, greedy ones, put it out, and they struck oil.

39:12.459 --> 39:14.822
So they could not...

39:15.022 --> 39:27.375
So as a result, anybody in Texas, higher education, you can be capital projects with available funds.

39:27.395 --> 39:30.759
But other funds have to come from state authorization.

39:31.660 --> 39:36.104
So you have HRC, easily can be built.

39:37.766 --> 39:43.172
You can buy all the collections, you can hire a ransom, convince the legislature that books are capital projects.

39:43.625 --> 39:46.690
I'd never heard a statement quite like that.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.933
I wish I had talked to you a lot.

39:48.953 --> 39:49.454
That's what it is.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.215
Capital project.

39:51.156 --> 39:55.082
As it's a capital project, it succeeded.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.665
Later, it dawned on that.

39:57.947 --> 40:07.181
But you were not able to get legislature to give you librarians, salaries, and so forth.

40:07.221 --> 40:09.224
But he was a genius at what he did.

40:09.264 --> 40:10.105
He was a genius.

40:10.355 --> 40:12.217
And it's a fun, fun chapter.

40:12.277 --> 40:15.121
It's one of my very favorite chapters in the whole book.

40:15.521 --> 40:18.885
How do you stand on these canon wars that are going on?

40:18.905 --> 40:20.307
Do you have an opinion on this?

40:21.448 --> 40:25.673
Well, I think it's the wrong war, to be frank with you.

40:26.394 --> 40:27.976
The issue is not canon.

40:29.178 --> 40:33.242
The issue is how you cope with explosion of knowledge.

40:34.444 --> 40:36.426
Nobody has a solution to that.

40:36.446 --> 40:37.948
That's the issue that's frustrating.

40:39.413 --> 40:46.905
You take Harvard Classics, 80% are no longer classics.

40:46.925 --> 40:47.205
That's right.

40:47.225 --> 40:48.627
What's the definition of a classic?

40:49.829 --> 40:51.051
And I mentioned canon.

40:51.772 --> 40:55.538
It's a, you can check this in one of these dictionaries.

40:55.899 --> 40:56.940
It comes from Arabic.

41:02.028 --> 41:03.671
What does it mean?

41:03.691 --> 41:06.315
It's been standard.

41:07.561 --> 41:08.662
So, but check that.

41:10.344 --> 41:19.255
So, let me just mention, this is a very difficult subject, but let me just mention a couple of things as you write your book.

41:22.099 --> 41:24.662
We had, at one time, European civilization.

41:27.285 --> 41:36.977
Suddenly, I don't know when, maybe when Byzantium was created, because Western Empire and Eastern Empire,

41:37.514 --> 41:39.436
suddenly became Western civilization.

41:42.639 --> 41:46.402
Never has defined itself.

41:46.442 --> 41:56.611
During World War I, French wrote that Germany is not part of Western civilization.

41:56.631 --> 41:57.372
Which is ridiculous, of course.

41:59.794 --> 42:07.521
They have incorporated Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and even maybe Turgenev or Gogol as part of Western canon.

42:09.340 --> 42:11.143
And then came Bolshevik Revolution.

42:12.504 --> 42:19.174
So, the West and East separation reinforced the notion of Western Civilization.

42:22.138 --> 42:27.906
Only the Gaul and like that always considered Europe from Atlantic to Europe.

42:30.670 --> 42:35.396
There was a notion also of American Civilization as distinct from European Civilization.

42:36.998 --> 42:38.841
But suddenly under the NATO,

42:39.158 --> 42:43.224
We have combined Western civilization with United States, which is fine.

42:43.885 --> 42:45.848
Canada, they don't know how to include that.

42:46.749 --> 42:48.372
And Europe, Western Europe.

42:48.392 --> 42:51.176
That's wonderful.

42:51.196 --> 42:53.680
So then how do you deal with Greece, modern Greece?

42:53.700 --> 42:54.521
Well, I'm Greek.

42:54.601 --> 42:54.841
I do.

42:54.881 --> 42:55.943
How do you deal with Greece?

42:57.065 --> 42:58.907
Well, it's part of Western, so it has to be.

42:58.988 --> 42:59.468
I hope so.

42:59.568 --> 43:00.069
All right.

43:01.011 --> 43:03.514
Then how do you deal with Turkey?

43:03.554 --> 43:04.796
Well, it's not, but it is.

43:04.936 --> 43:05.397
It's not.

43:05.878 --> 43:07.060
Ottoman and so forth.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.001
So they're very concerned.

43:08.403 --> 43:10.306
How do you deal with Czechoslovakia now?

43:10.727 --> 43:11.207
How do you?

43:12.509 --> 43:14.052
Well, I deal with ambivalence.

43:16.055 --> 43:17.377
How about Hungary?

43:17.717 --> 43:18.839
How about Romania?

43:20.482 --> 43:26.591
As NATO expands now, they're going to include all of these countries, I'm sure, as part of Western civilization.

43:27.733 --> 43:30.978
Then the issue becomes... Well, is it political or is it cultural?

43:30.998 --> 43:32.861
Well, this one, I'm trying to find out.

43:33.502 --> 43:36.807
I think it's mostly political.

43:37.124 --> 43:40.068
When they say Judeo-Christian, Russians are Christians.

43:40.108 --> 43:42.291
So are you excluding Greek Orthodox?

43:42.831 --> 43:43.512
That's nothing.

43:43.532 --> 43:48.499
If so, how come Greeks are included there?

43:48.519 --> 43:51.903
How can you include Yugoslavia?

43:53.645 --> 43:54.466
You know, Slavs.

43:55.207 --> 43:57.290
Are you excluding Slavs?

43:57.310 --> 43:59.713
If so, how do you deal with the Poles?

43:59.914 --> 44:03.278
All kinds of issues.

44:03.718 --> 44:04.920
Coming back to canon,

44:05.643 --> 44:13.612
Canon was an easy way to structure knowledge from Renaissance to 18th century, 19th century.

44:13.632 --> 44:14.613
Then there's breakdown.

44:16.055 --> 44:28.950
Because who did we ask in United States Harvard Press, a member of the Modern Library Board, publishing their series, whom did you ask?

44:29.656 --> 44:30.837
What should be part of it?

44:30.877 --> 44:33.260
Did we ask French Academy of Art Sciences?

44:33.280 --> 44:36.103
Well, they have their own play on editions, though, so I guess we forget.

44:36.123 --> 44:44.453
Well, did we ask them, excuse us, but which is your most important authors to be part of Western canon?

44:46.716 --> 44:46.776
No.

44:46.796 --> 44:47.857
Did we ask English?

44:49.599 --> 44:50.440
Did we ask Russians?

44:50.580 --> 44:52.082
No.

44:52.102 --> 44:56.147
The biggest problem that they have not been able to deal with the canon is Latin America.

44:57.048 --> 44:59.190
There's 500 years of Latin America.

45:00.183 --> 45:00.764
500 years.

45:02.226 --> 45:08.956
It's Italian, it's German, Spanish, Portuguese, European.

45:10.378 --> 45:12.802
Is it part of Western civilization?

45:14.264 --> 45:22.537
If so, how come it has not produced until now one single book worthy of the canon?

45:23.318 --> 45:26.943
I think we're coming to Latin America.

45:26.963 --> 45:28.806
I mean, who could exclude Borges?

45:30.524 --> 45:37.134
But there is no method of determining as to what constitutes part of the canon.

45:38.656 --> 45:44.985
Because now, instead of saying the canon, we say several canons.

45:45.947 --> 45:48.230
Asian civilization canon.

45:48.250 --> 45:51.074
Which is probably the best approach, would you agree with that?

45:51.094 --> 45:53.538
Yes, Asian African civilization.

45:54.700 --> 45:57.103
Before it was simple, you have European civilization.

45:57.484 --> 45:59.687
And in 1930s, by the way, 1930s,

46:00.477 --> 46:02.440
a new thing emerged also.

46:02.480 --> 46:07.888
You had, for the first time, Americans used American civilization.

46:10.011 --> 46:10.532
You know why?

46:10.572 --> 46:18.063
They were afraid of European culture, which had each nation had its own soul, its own blood, its own mentality, or frightened.

46:18.444 --> 46:24.393
So America was civilization combining all different cultures into one civilization, that Roman civilization.

46:26.195 --> 46:29.320
In the 1930s, you have Beatrice and Sidney Webb,

46:30.768 --> 46:37.277
Fabian Socialists, publishing about Soviet Russia, a new civilization.

46:38.819 --> 46:44.987
All of them trying to deal with the issue that is very important, but nobody wants to deal with that.

46:45.748 --> 46:47.010
Concept of progress.

46:47.971 --> 46:51.055
Is there linear concept of progress?

46:51.176 --> 46:56.563
If so, what are foundations that are needed to lead you to that progress?

46:56.583 --> 46:59.627
In the 18th century, they knew, in the Age of Enlightenment.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.462
These are steps.

47:01.482 --> 47:06.527
19th century positivism, these are the stages.

47:06.547 --> 47:08.810
The 20th century is collapse.

47:08.830 --> 47:13.315
And then we have all this post-modernist stuff, which is impenetrable.

47:13.335 --> 47:14.035
Impenetrable.

47:14.296 --> 47:18.941
And I said, first, you have to create before you can deconstruct.

47:18.961 --> 47:26.389
You have to construct before you can deconstruct.

47:26.409 --> 47:28.011
Now, when you talk about all of these

47:28.447 --> 47:48.956
I am interested, in fact, I've been talking about Edward Kasaneck at the public library who's giving me names of people, and he's really suggesting that maybe I might want to spend some time in Eastern Europe and see what has happened to the whole library structure post-Soviet, because during the Soviet period, these are instruments of policy, libraries were.

47:49.256 --> 47:53.322
It was almost like all these nations, all these states didn't have a culture anymore.

47:53.342 --> 47:55.625
Well, Soviet period... I don't mean to simplify it.

47:55.685 --> 47:57.728
No, no, the Soviet period was very...

47:58.147 --> 48:00.550
fascinating for me, because you have three libraries.

48:02.912 --> 48:06.576
Library one, available for general public.

48:06.596 --> 48:09.179
Library two, available for party researchers.

48:10.480 --> 48:18.949
And library three, certain collections available only to police bureau, banned books, sort of.

48:18.969 --> 48:19.850
And that could be anything.

48:20.410 --> 48:21.131
That could be anything.

48:21.151 --> 48:22.212
That could be Hemingway.

48:22.533 --> 48:24.795
For example, you had

48:26.311 --> 48:32.076
Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1950s edition.

48:32.096 --> 48:34.459
Right after Stalin died, Beria was killed.

48:35.500 --> 48:46.210
Subscribers received... a segment.

48:46.230 --> 48:48.812
He said, please remove pages 28 to 30.

48:49.172 --> 48:49.453
Really?

48:49.793 --> 48:50.013
No.

48:50.314 --> 48:50.634
Really?

48:50.654 --> 48:50.734
Yes.

48:51.475 --> 48:54.057
It was Beria, and replaced this Bering Sea.

48:55.690 --> 48:56.511
Is this it?

48:56.531 --> 48:56.771
Yeah.

48:57.011 --> 48:58.452
Can I document this?

48:58.492 --> 48:59.393
That's wonderful.

48:59.433 --> 49:07.580
Dr. Kasinek, he will give you a censored version of Bolshoi-Sovetska Encyclopedia.

49:07.600 --> 49:16.147
And so now, you have libraries over there discovering... I was at a dinner that Paul gave, by the way, for Zaitsev, and I went to that.

49:17.168 --> 49:22.192
And in fact, he introduced him as, he said, he's the Bartram Gregorian of St.

49:22.212 --> 49:22.773
Petersburg.

49:23.293 --> 49:25.275
He knows everybody.

49:25.542 --> 49:32.109
But it's a difficult situation they find themselves in, and all of a sudden there's no money.

49:33.291 --> 49:36.214
The collections are in desperate disarray.

49:36.734 --> 49:42.941
But from a nation of readers, Russia was nation of readers on the Soviet Union.

49:42.961 --> 49:53.693
The only thing left to you were 19th century classics, 18th century classics, as a source of consolation for an educated person, poetry and so forth.

49:55.377 --> 50:07.803
Now it's gone post-Soviet, in which television, all of these others are vying for the public's attention.

50:09.185 --> 50:14.837
The book is still considered in Russia and so forth as

50:15.830 --> 50:17.813
a valuable commodity.

50:17.833 --> 50:20.437
It was just a piece that they're selling everything.

50:20.457 --> 50:21.740
Trash, it doesn't matter.

50:21.820 --> 50:22.521
They're selling everything.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.083
Insatiable appetite for everything.

50:24.103 --> 50:29.772
But also, I think libraries are in terrible shape because I'm sure they're selling also clandestinely collections and so forth.

50:29.792 --> 50:30.253
Well, they are.

50:30.393 --> 50:33.378
That's not... We know that.

50:33.398 --> 50:36.864
It's something that... And I know we only have a few minutes.

50:38.486 --> 50:41.331
Also, in the hamburger piece, which I thought was...

50:42.728 --> 50:50.274
a great comment, and you may say it here, but we talk about, you talk about libraries as repositories of memory.

50:51.736 --> 50:59.342
And it's not just information, not just books as objects, but they are repositories of generations of memory.

51:00.603 --> 51:12.313
And, you know, when I see something like Sarajevo, for instance, when it was deliberate targeting and destruction of a library and to destroy in one night 1.2 million books,

51:12.935 --> 51:18.924
I have to feel that's not just a random act of war, that is a deliberate attempt to erase... Assassinate memory.

51:19.945 --> 51:23.130
And, I mean, is this what... Assassinate memory, yes.

51:23.150 --> 51:31.081
And so when I talk about libraries of the future, you know, everything is not necessarily all wonderful and rosy and computerized and digitized.

51:31.462 --> 51:40.174
We also have it within our capability, don't we, to continue to do this kind of... Destructive act.

51:40.458 --> 51:59.458
Well, one of the things that the libraries, in every totalitarian culture, the first enemy, as in Orwell, is seen as the book library.

51:59.478 --> 52:03.722
Library always has been seen as a source of threat.

52:03.742 --> 52:04.844
Because it is memory.

52:05.684 --> 52:10.009
And memory allows you to compare, to remember.

52:11.002 --> 52:18.793
compare, transcend, to see comparatively.

52:19.955 --> 52:30.309
And whenever you see relativistically other truths, other shades, that never is well left.

52:30.329 --> 52:36.338
Can you think of any specific examples where the libraries have been targeted?

52:36.358 --> 52:38.781
Well, you just take Nazi Germany.

52:39.335 --> 52:41.718
Burning all the decadent books.

52:42.179 --> 52:43.520
Burning all the decadent books.

52:44.542 --> 52:48.987
Like Russia, banning books.

52:49.208 --> 52:49.628
China.

52:51.230 --> 52:58.059
Suddenly, Chuan Lai's book, or Bichai Chu's book, not being available.

53:01.023 --> 53:02.925
Khrushchev, when he stepped down.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.173
Not available, yeah?

53:09.760 --> 53:11.342
Stalin, after his death.

53:13.344 --> 53:14.065
Not available.

53:14.966 --> 53:15.547
Trotsky.

53:17.249 --> 53:19.372
Bernstein, Trotsky.

53:20.453 --> 53:21.615
Listed.

53:21.635 --> 53:22.596
Attacks against him.

53:22.676 --> 53:23.998
His books are not available.

53:24.518 --> 53:27.162
Even, dare we say, the Catholic Church and its index?

53:27.182 --> 53:27.903
Catholic Church.

53:28.243 --> 53:31.807
But at least Catholic Church kept index of what they had banned.

53:33.249 --> 53:34.931
So there wasn't consistency.

53:35.151 --> 53:37.995
Not only consistency, but you kept a memory of what you had banned.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.645
That's very interesting, isn't it?

53:41.665 --> 53:43.248
Others had eliminated even that.

53:44.570 --> 53:57.717
Orwell's adoption that whoever controls the present controls the future is at the source of all of these things.

53:58.177 --> 54:02.025
The past is considered to be dangerous, knowledge of the past.

54:03.608 --> 54:12.379
Whoever controls the past and memory, 1984 says, controls the present, and whoever controls the present controls the future.

54:12.399 --> 54:15.443
So the OO articulated in pretty much those terms?

54:15.463 --> 54:17.806
Yeah, exactly those terms.

54:17.826 --> 54:19.068
The big brother.

54:19.088 --> 54:21.591
So that's the 1984, which I haven't read.

54:22.653 --> 54:30.923
And of course, another thing I'm interested in is the erection, the establishment of these emigre libraries.

54:30.943 --> 54:33.126
That when you try to destroy a memory,

54:33.713 --> 54:44.603
Okay, maybe you can where you are, but then you find, like I just learned in Poland, for instance, when there was no Poland, the Polish National Library was in Paris.

54:44.623 --> 54:44.703
Yes.

54:44.723 --> 54:45.264
Portable.

54:46.265 --> 54:46.985
Portable memory.

54:47.005 --> 54:47.406
That's right.

54:47.686 --> 54:51.609
And so we have in New York City all these wonderful little emigre libraries.

54:51.990 --> 55:01.999
Well, in New York City, you had one of the first exhibitions we did at the New York Public Library was Ethnic Press in New York.

55:02.401 --> 55:10.248
You have, without exaggerating, 200 ethnic presses in New York.

55:10.268 --> 55:12.230
You have six Chinese dailies, I'm told.

55:13.111 --> 55:24.882
Four Korean dailies, Japanese, 47 Yiddish and Hebrew, Greek, all kinds of publications.

55:25.243 --> 55:29.927
Armenian, two Armenian newspapers in New York.

55:31.088 --> 55:34.211
And this is another time also when Armenia was without a country.

55:34.411 --> 55:37.434
Yeah, but all of them keep the memory and diaspora alive.

55:38.134 --> 55:38.875
Jewish Bund.

55:39.536 --> 55:42.038
Their library now just went out of business.

55:42.138 --> 55:44.200
I think it was incorporated.

55:44.220 --> 55:45.461
I was talking about 1905.

55:46.162 --> 55:55.770
They were expelled from Marxist, Leninists, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, expelled them because they wanted to be nationalist Marxists.

55:55.911 --> 55:57.072
They said, you cannot do that.

55:57.932 --> 56:00.775
Well, where did they bring their library?

56:02.273 --> 56:03.635
United States, New York.

56:04.436 --> 56:11.466
Ninety-year-old people still working about the debates of 1905, Jewish boom, as if it happened yesterday.

56:11.646 --> 56:18.014
This is a good little area for me to explore, don't you think?

56:18.034 --> 56:18.135
Yeah.

56:18.255 --> 56:23.242
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Philip Roth wrote to me.

56:24.744 --> 56:30.011
He was sponsoring Hungarian writers in this country.

56:30.031 --> 56:31.673
It was Hungarian press in New York.

56:32.716 --> 56:34.378
publishing their works.

56:34.398 --> 56:40.165
Polish, five, six papers, weeklys in New York.

56:40.185 --> 56:41.507
German, French.

56:43.489 --> 56:48.916
That's a whole underground press, which I call a parallel memory.

56:54.003 --> 56:56.726
New York is unique to this.

56:56.746 --> 56:57.367
Incredible.

56:57.507 --> 56:59.870
And you're going back.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.453
Well, it's an incredible place.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.262
My time is running out.

57:05.322 --> 57:13.513
Well, let's get together again, because this article will answer 80% of your questions.

57:14.094 --> 57:15.576
And then let's focus on 20%.

57:16.036 --> 57:17.118
Okay.

57:17.158 --> 57:21.904
And then we'll get a nice, sharp, good... Yeah.

57:22.005 --> 57:23.226
I think we're up.

57:23.246 --> 57:24.868
Let me just see if there's one other quick thing.

57:25.369 --> 57:26.290
Just let me, if I may.

57:27.031 --> 57:30.035
I do have about five minutes.

57:30.055 --> 57:33.520
Just make sure there's anything that's not...

57:34.141 --> 57:37.446
Maybe we could just wrap it up by going back to the beginning.

57:37.767 --> 57:41.813
I read also that you started as a page in the library.

57:41.833 --> 57:42.794
Tabriz.

57:42.814 --> 57:44.717
Is this the start for you?

57:45.138 --> 57:51.848
Yeah, because what allows... It allowed me to save my life in many ways.

57:52.249 --> 57:56.335
My inner life and my future life.

57:57.838 --> 58:01.363
Because pressures put on people like the peer pressure.

58:05.140 --> 58:07.242
all my young friends and so forth.

58:09.064 --> 58:10.346
Why are you going to the library?

58:12.528 --> 58:14.750
You know, are you one of the nerds and so forth?

58:15.591 --> 58:16.913
And you say, no, I have to work.

58:18.935 --> 58:20.356
You can justify it.

58:20.376 --> 58:24.020
When I was at the New York Public Library, I discovered how many pages there were.

58:24.861 --> 58:27.644
Jimmy Cagney was a page at the New York Public Library.

58:28.425 --> 58:30.127
You should ask how they forget.

58:30.527 --> 58:31.468
Gee, that's good.

58:32.258 --> 58:44.092
Because I'm also interested in writers who were librarians, like Borges, and Goethe was a librarian, Lessing was a librarian, and Laozi Tu, I think, was that.

58:44.212 --> 58:46.655
Somebody was a librarian.

58:47.315 --> 58:51.320
But I think you should look at that, because... Pages.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.181
Pages at MPL.

58:52.802 --> 58:55.545
That's great.

58:56.466 --> 58:57.828
I think we've got an hour here.

58:58.628 --> 58:59.970
We've got a good start.

59:00.457 --> 59:01.879
and a wonderful staff.

59:01.919 --> 59:02.860
Just a good staff.

59:03.100 --> 59:05.403
He said that I have said it when he quotes me.

59:05.463 --> 59:09.268
Somebody said that you've said that libraries... Yeah, I have since used that.

59:09.649 --> 59:11.992
Ken Burns, who produced... Oh, okay, sure.

59:12.012 --> 59:18.500
Yeah, he said in one of his speeches that... Do you ascribe... Do you ascribe... Yeah, I must have said it, and it must have made an impression on him.

59:19.782 --> 59:25.349
And this is about technology, mostly, which is very important.

59:25.489 --> 59:27.932
This is about canon and...

59:28.216 --> 59:29.578
Everything.

59:29.858 --> 59:37.848
And this one was quoted in New York Review of Books and Farrell, and this is eight years.

59:38.829 --> 59:40.191
That's his origin rate.

59:40.211 --> 59:47.100
Well, I think this is just like... Just briefly, I'm going to London in two weeks, and this is going to be a major international focus.

59:47.340 --> 59:49.923
Can you think of any people that you'd recommend that I should see?

59:50.844 --> 59:51.545
Nicholas Ram?

59:51.685 --> 59:52.266
What's the name?

59:52.921 --> 59:55.785
Nicholas Barker.

59:56.366 --> 59:57.428
Nicholas Barker.

59:57.448 --> 59:59.731
Nicholas Barker.

59:59.751 --> 01:00:01.093
And also Lord Quentin.

01:00:01.574 --> 01:00:02.675
Yes, right.

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:03.557
Okay, good.

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:05.940
Good.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.762
Okay, excellent.

01:00:06.782 --> 01:00:11.949
And Paul, who I just chatted with, said, please give Martin my very, very best.

01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:14.473
They're all thrilled that you're coming back.
