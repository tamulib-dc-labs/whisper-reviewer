00:03.085 --> 00:30.207
How do you feel in the face of this in writing this book?

00:30.406 --> 00:32.568
Well, you know, I currently understand the anger.

00:32.648 --> 00:35.991
I mean, I understood it against my brother foremost.

00:36.792 --> 00:39.895
I mean, I had my own anger at him for what he had done.

00:40.816 --> 00:46.782
And I also, and I understand society's anger at large.

00:49.584 --> 00:50.065
I'm just saying.

00:50.205 --> 00:53.288
Yeah, I do it myself all the time.

00:54.389 --> 00:55.770
You know, these are frightening times.

00:56.371 --> 00:57.612
Oh, yeah.

00:58.148 --> 01:00.030
People do feel under siege.

01:00.050 --> 01:00.811
They feel threatened.

01:01.252 --> 01:08.620
I've experienced a lot of the same fear and damage that other people have in the last few years.

01:08.741 --> 01:13.726
I had somebody shot the desk for my apartment building where I live here in Los Angeles.

01:14.287 --> 01:15.308
You live out here in LA?

01:15.348 --> 01:16.770
Yes, just about a year and a half ago.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.694
I've been robbed many times.

01:20.294 --> 01:25.861
When I worked at a record store, I would sell it at a nice point.

01:27.022 --> 01:27.683
I understand it.

01:28.287 --> 01:28.768
the anger.

01:28.828 --> 01:32.233
I agree that there is a crisis.

01:33.334 --> 01:39.283
I also have strong feelings about how that crisis is interpreted and perceived and reported.

01:39.904 --> 01:49.559
It's interesting that a year ago there was no perception of a tremendous crime crisis in this country.

01:49.799 --> 01:51.802
This comes and goes.

01:52.303 --> 01:55.167
Issues over crime.

01:55.467 --> 01:55.948
Crime is

01:56.165 --> 01:57.206
It's always going to be with us.

01:57.266 --> 02:06.478
It's a periodic issue, and there are periodic concerns or panics about it, and we're certainly going through an intense one at this point.

02:06.538 --> 02:18.713
And I certainly think that some of that has to do with what kind of reportage we've seen, that around the time of the polyclast incident, there was

02:19.267 --> 02:36.435
There was a good deal of reports that I think gave Americans a sense that everybody's at danger, that everybody is at risk in the society, even though some of the statistics indicated that in some ways violent crime was dropping.

02:37.096 --> 02:40.462
But I agree there's a problem.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.625
It has to be addressed.

02:43.229 --> 02:46.293
because clearly it threatens all our futures.

02:46.313 --> 02:55.504
Just to say that perhaps there's a solution to, you know, definitely kids.

02:56.085 --> 03:00.511
All right, go ahead.

03:00.531 --> 03:12.966
There's this fact that I think you articulated in this interview and also in the parts of the book that I have read that we should be really focusing our resources on

03:14.684 --> 03:16.987
the early stages of... Oh, yeah.

03:17.047 --> 03:18.449
But that's not going to happen, is it?

03:18.469 --> 03:19.450
No, it's not.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.571
I'm sure it's not.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.455
But it doesn't change the truth.

03:23.475 --> 03:30.984
But if it's a kid that I do, and I have two girls, and they're 13 and they're 11, and one of these guys is victimized, I'm furious.

03:31.084 --> 03:32.366
Of course you are.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.569
I want satisfaction.

03:35.109 --> 03:39.675
I don't want an explanation of three centuries of abuse.

03:39.975 --> 03:42.278
No, nor should you...

03:42.528 --> 03:48.220
have to, you know, rationalize your feelings on the basis of that explanation.

03:48.621 --> 03:59.044
I mean, if somebody killed somebody very close to me, you know, a person I love, I would have all the same thing that we all would have.

03:59.124 --> 04:01.549
I, in turn, would want to see that person.

04:01.934 --> 04:10.513
I have no trouble comprehending that.

04:10.734 --> 04:17.850
I have no trouble comprehending the idea of something like the death penalty as a matter of vengeance.

04:17.830 --> 04:22.196
rather than... You don't feel that it accomplishes anything in the long run.

04:22.997 --> 04:23.197
No.

04:23.257 --> 04:25.941
Your brother's purpose is as much as it is in society.

04:25.961 --> 04:26.702
Oh, yeah, of course.

04:26.762 --> 04:29.506
In his case, obviously.

04:29.746 --> 04:31.668
And also, I think it accomplishes something.

04:31.688 --> 04:41.762
I think it underscores the whole climate of violence and the whole rationality of killing.

04:41.922 --> 04:44.125
I think what it accomplishes is

04:44.729 --> 05:10.500
you know is in a way a deterrent i feel i do feel strongly that if you were to uh i think if you were to step up the rate of executions in this country you probably see two things happen or three things pricey and initially some some real pleasure that was happening you would um over the long run see that if they would have virtually no effect on the

05:10.717 --> 05:15.302
the rate of violence or murder in society.

05:15.322 --> 05:24.371
And I think in the long term, you begin to see a real dissatisfaction with that whole process and what it renders.

05:25.612 --> 05:39.306
I mean, it is... I think that

05:40.771 --> 05:57.087
To really counter-effect crime or to try to do something to limit its horrible impact on all of us and on this society, I think you have to look at where crime comes from.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.610
And we are doing that.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.672
I mean, there's a great deal of disagreement.

06:01.712 --> 06:09.259
There are those who say where crime comes from is from the media's portrayal of crime or in terms of television or where it comes from films.

06:10.066 --> 06:16.955
But I think that crime comes from the human heart.

06:17.716 --> 06:20.019
Let's talk about this book, Michael.

06:20.039 --> 06:22.402
First of all, tell me about the spelling of your name.

06:22.702 --> 06:23.143
It's Michael.

06:23.203 --> 06:24.444
It always looks Russian.

06:24.905 --> 06:27.649
No, there's no Russian kin.

06:28.169 --> 06:35.078
I was born with the spelling in the normal way and kept that spelling until I was about 14.

06:35.243 --> 06:40.229
My mother had a good friend who had a baby that they named Michael, and that was the spelling they used.

06:40.249 --> 06:41.710
She really liked it.

06:41.790 --> 06:46.155
I was starting high school, and she suggested that I change the spelling.

06:46.175 --> 06:51.361
She said, if I could change the spelling in 15 years, I would have given it to you.

06:51.401 --> 07:00.812
Of course, when you were a kid, the idea of having any kind of singularity, any distinction, was quite exciting.

07:01.332 --> 07:04.175
Christian name, so to speak, is M-I-C-H-E-N.

07:04.195 --> 07:04.856
Yes, that's right.

07:04.936 --> 07:06.278
And so it has changed.

07:06.298 --> 07:10.082
And I just changed it to this guy.

07:10.162 --> 07:14.126
And that's not likely to get into my piece.

07:14.146 --> 07:14.467
I'm curious.

07:16.128 --> 07:19.152
This book is an unusual kind of exercise, isn't it?

07:19.172 --> 07:27.341
I mean, do you think that you would have a publisher like Dumbleday for the connection with Gary Gilmore?

07:27.461 --> 07:28.302
No.

07:28.670 --> 07:29.291
Probably not.

07:29.351 --> 07:30.752
I'm realistic about that.

07:30.772 --> 07:33.034
Pardon me for being brutal.

07:33.054 --> 07:49.431
It's a wonderfully written book, and I'm not minimizing it in any way, but on the other hand, we all remember Gary saying, let's do it, and he gets shot, and we have this pilot shot in the heart, and so you have the occasion.

07:49.992 --> 07:52.174
Tell me a bit about it.

07:52.194 --> 07:54.196
That's a completely fair statement.

07:54.216 --> 07:55.437
One of the reasons

07:55.838 --> 08:08.137
I stayed away from the story by and large, with the exception of writing about a Rolling Stone a couple of times, was exactly for that reason.

08:08.338 --> 08:19.956
I knew that there was a power and attraction to Gary's story, and I knew that it would be an easy thing

08:20.273 --> 08:28.041
So I have people approach me a couple times over the years about doing more writing on it, and I just, I wouldn't even entertain.

08:28.421 --> 08:40.253
In my own reading about you and about this book, I was prepared to dismiss you, but I find that you are akin to discourage a professional writer.

08:40.273 --> 08:47.040
And, you know, I make my living from the pen, and this is not something that you have decided to do

08:47.442 --> 08:48.624
to make a fast buck.

08:48.804 --> 08:51.067
You've been doing this for a number of years.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.395
Believe me, I wouldn't be here today if I didn't feel that you were a professional writer.

08:56.555 --> 08:58.117
Well, thank you.

08:58.418 --> 08:59.699
I'm glad you did.

08:59.719 --> 09:07.430
I look you straight in the eyes as I say this, and I say, who the hell is writing this thing before I know who you are?

09:07.450 --> 09:10.735
It's very well written, and this is why we're here.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.339
For me, from my standpoint.

09:14.661 --> 09:16.403
Put that on the record, it won't take much.

09:16.636 --> 09:19.359
So, go ahead.

09:19.379 --> 09:23.064
Well, yes, I was certainly aware.

09:23.945 --> 09:25.747
Actually, some of it caught me by surprise.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.570
There are stories that we have to tell.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.811
There are stories we have to tell.

09:29.031 --> 09:34.138
And I didn't even want to think about this story.

09:34.218 --> 09:38.784
You must have known at some point that you would have to deal with it.

09:38.804 --> 09:44.010
I did not until it became apparent I could no longer not deal with it.

09:44.108 --> 10:06.100
which happened to me in a period of clinical depression where you start to examine the things that create your depression, where it comes from, and then you look at some of the historical antecedents in your own history, your own family's history, and I realized I was carrying things around that I had never known I was carrying around.

10:06.120 --> 10:11.247
I had told myself that I had to escape my family and that I was not an heir.

10:11.632 --> 10:12.073
At all.

10:12.513 --> 10:18.342
And for me to discover that I was an heir was almost immobilizing.

10:18.362 --> 10:25.753
I mean, I know that during that time I came in as close to self-destruction as I'm capable of.

10:25.873 --> 10:35.007
Do you think if Gary hadn't have done what you've done, and this drama hadn't played itself out, that you would have still been a writer?

10:36.409 --> 10:37.891
Yeah, I had started to be a writer.

10:37.932 --> 10:40.255
I was writing for Rolling Stone when Gary

10:40.589 --> 10:51.388
And I've been writing for local papers in Portland for two or three years, covering music for a couple of newspapers.

10:51.408 --> 10:56.196
So this is a story then at some point which says, it's a roadblock, it's here.

10:56.276 --> 10:58.079
I have to do something with it.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.583
I wrote this because I am a writer.

11:00.884 --> 11:02.587
It's a story.

11:02.807 --> 11:04.470
Yeah.

11:04.855 --> 11:08.140
We've done it with stories in our lifetimes, and we have to do it.

11:08.441 --> 11:10.424
It's just as you said, there are stories we have to tell.

11:10.664 --> 11:16.795
I appreciate that entirely.

11:16.815 --> 11:21.983
If you have the ability to write, I never like writing.

11:22.023 --> 11:24.147
In fact, I really hate doing it.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.290
I do it every week.

11:26.557 --> 11:30.020
I take it out of the last deadline to the last minute, but we do it.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.381
Yes, and it's what I do.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.022
It's all I do.

11:32.042 --> 11:32.963
But we love it.

11:33.043 --> 11:36.225
And it's all I'm trained to do.

11:36.326 --> 11:37.907
It's all I can do.

11:37.927 --> 11:40.209
I was, I, you know, I need this and this.

11:40.229 --> 11:41.190
He thought this was my interview, too.

11:41.210 --> 11:45.394
Yeah, I remember a very good friend named Steve Harrison who just signed a hold.

11:45.414 --> 11:45.754
Oh, you did?

11:47.135 --> 11:47.435
Yeah.

11:47.455 --> 11:50.138
Steve and I went out drinking a lot.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.639
And we'll probably do it again tonight.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.260
He lives about a block from me.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.962
These things do happen.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.243
Oh, yes, yes, they do.

11:56.695 --> 11:59.879
Alan's here, by the way.

11:59.899 --> 12:00.299
Oh, that's right.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.400
You mentioned his name.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.523
Yeah.

12:03.543 --> 12:10.811
So, yes, I, when I finally decided I had an interest in this story, I wrote a letter to him.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.993
There's a risk here for you, by the way.

12:13.394 --> 12:14.615
Yeah, there's a big risk.

12:14.655 --> 12:24.486
You really want the risk of being tapped as the guy who's, as the guy who's, you know, all the other writing that you've done for 20-odd years.

12:25.768 --> 12:26.128
Thank you.

12:26.362 --> 12:56.200
very much you're right in fact and i will have to live with that now i i sort of chose to live with the one thing i didn't want to live with which is that i will be associated with the story i know now that i will be associated with the story more than anything else i will ever do uh and i for years i i tried to avoid that i resented that any of these things had happened in my life uh and i

12:56.787 --> 13:20.618
and i tried to disclaim i mean you know many times over the years i'd meet people and when they would hear my name there would be the frequent comment of or you or you wouldn't be gary gilmore's brother and they always say it jokingly the same way they always say half-assed things you know if you met somebody with the last name nixon you'd say oh well you see i wouldn't do that because it is that unusual name i mean my name is a bad thing if i went on the shot

13:21.543 --> 13:21.924
people.

13:22.846 --> 13:23.928
You're like Hitler.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.290
The guy's name is Hitler.

13:25.310 --> 13:25.491
Right.

13:26.152 --> 13:26.653
Go Hitler.

13:27.735 --> 13:28.677
No relation, right?

13:28.717 --> 13:29.779
There's a problem here.

13:33.266 --> 13:33.707
Yeah, exactly.

13:33.727 --> 13:35.631
But Gilmore is not an unusual name.

13:35.711 --> 13:36.012
No.

13:36.593 --> 13:39.298
And it's far enough removed in

13:40.628 --> 13:43.332
I mean, it happened, but what is it, 17, 18 years?

13:43.352 --> 13:44.353
13 years, yeah.

13:44.373 --> 13:45.475
And here's the Mailer book.

13:46.777 --> 13:49.621
How did you deal with Norman?

13:50.061 --> 13:52.224
I dealt with him always through other people.

13:53.165 --> 13:57.331
I dealt with him through Larry Shiller and through his assistant, Judith McNally.

13:57.732 --> 14:04.341
I sent him a long list of questions, and he wrote some replies, and he turned over a

14:04.658 --> 14:28.101
a lot of records he turned over uh gary's prison records extremely extremely decent grapes to both him and hillary schiller because i had not not only had i not participated in executioner's song but uh but you know i i plainly had strong strong doubt what were you trying i mean what point at what point might you decide to do this i mean just double bacon forward and say

14:29.060 --> 14:33.785
Do you reach a point in your life when they say I had to do this?

14:33.805 --> 14:34.505
That's pretty much it.

14:34.545 --> 14:45.997
What happened was, as I said, I was in a period of depression where I began to realize that some of that was family stuff, and I began to think about it and talk about it a lot to friends and a good therapist.

14:47.178 --> 14:53.704
And one friend suggested one night, as we heard having drinks, she said, this is the story you should write.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.046
I heard it from the way you talk about it.

14:56.066 --> 14:56.767
This is the story.

14:57.388 --> 14:58.729
Because I had tried a couple books and had to do it.

14:58.979 --> 15:02.745
you know, fall on my face in the process.

15:02.865 --> 15:12.120
You said you were suffering from chronic depression, which is a pretty focused thing, right?

15:12.621 --> 15:20.674
Do you think that your relationship to this whole situation was a bad thing in terms of depression?

15:20.814 --> 15:26.083
I'm sure that... I think that the question that came out was...

15:27.667 --> 15:29.869
It was something I've been carrying with me for a long time.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.491
That wasn't the only issue.

15:31.872 --> 15:41.623
I mean, one of the things about depression is it can reverberate back through everything in your life, a bad love affair, a lost job, bad health, so many things.

15:42.524 --> 15:50.232
By the time you go back to all those things, the very last thing you get to might be the place where you learn depression.

15:50.372 --> 15:51.634
In my case, it was the family.

15:52.014 --> 15:54.497
That was the last thing I traced my depression to.

15:54.517 --> 15:57.100
When I would get depressed, I never had anything...

15:57.502 --> 15:58.103
to do that.

15:58.163 --> 16:00.205
And I certainly don't think that was the sole source.

16:00.225 --> 16:05.792
I mean, depression can come from so many different causes, including chemical imbalance.

16:05.812 --> 16:07.814
You know, I don't want to hang at all on that.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.496
Did you reach the William Styron case?

16:09.857 --> 16:10.517
I read his book.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.582
Were you suicide and this kind of stuff?

16:14.602 --> 16:16.765
I never really considered suicide.

16:17.025 --> 16:21.030
I know I wanted to die, but I never considered suicide.

16:21.370 --> 16:22.772
I was really terrified of life.

16:23.353 --> 16:27.137
And it was the kind of thing where I would sometimes

16:27.809 --> 16:32.354
I find myself wishing a truck would just fly off the street and hit me.

16:32.374 --> 16:33.015
That kind of thing.

16:33.336 --> 16:35.718
No, I never thought of action.

16:35.738 --> 16:41.525
I mean, I did think about it, but not to the point where I thought, okay, what I will do is I'll get a gun.

16:43.027 --> 16:52.859
Whenever I would think along those lines, I would realize that I was way too close to my brother at those moments.

16:52.939 --> 16:55.842
Whenever I would think about something like killing myself, I would realize that

16:56.345 --> 16:57.907
that brought me too close to him.

16:57.927 --> 17:02.393
What is the personal pain for you?

17:02.413 --> 17:04.075
You mean of this story?

17:04.335 --> 17:04.956
In this story?

17:07.098 --> 17:07.539
Yeah.

17:08.020 --> 17:12.025
I think I had to discover that over and over throughout the years.

17:12.225 --> 17:26.082
I remember there was a period after I finished writing this, and I have to say that the night I finished it was a night I felt wonderful, even though it doesn't come to a particularly happy ending as a story.

17:26.416 --> 17:32.085
About a month later, I sent it off to my editor, and I didn't want to look at it for a long time.

17:32.165 --> 17:39.897
A month or two later, when I was doing sort of a preliminary copy edit or something like that, I sat down and read it.

17:39.917 --> 17:43.342
And that was the first time I'd read it as a piece since I'd finished it.

17:43.943 --> 17:46.086
And I got really depressed.

17:46.747 --> 17:55.140
And I think what I realized was just, you know, living with the loss of all that mortality,

17:55.542 --> 18:05.211
I realized through this I got to know people in my family in a way that I had never thought about before, but I didn't get to interact with them.

18:05.291 --> 18:08.334
I mean, almost everybody in this story is dead except for my brother Frank.

18:08.894 --> 18:19.644
And I realized when I finished that proofreading or copy editing reading, I sat myself in one night and I felt really awful.

18:19.684 --> 18:24.148
I realized that I will never have these people again.

18:24.550 --> 18:26.593
I never get to see them or talk to them again.

18:26.653 --> 18:28.436
They're gone forever.

18:28.656 --> 18:29.737
And I missed them.

18:29.898 --> 18:34.464
And I realized I really missed my mother.

18:35.666 --> 18:41.214
I probably missed my father at least because he died when I was fairly young, and I had a good relationship with him.

18:41.234 --> 18:43.857
Well, apparently you didn't realize that he was a violent freshman then.

18:43.877 --> 18:44.659
No, I had no idea.

18:44.699 --> 18:44.879
He is.

18:45.019 --> 18:45.800
I had no idea.

18:48.444 --> 18:52.009
As a book which goes out now into the marketplace,

18:54.554 --> 19:04.886
Well, what do you want these people and, you know, the vital signs are positive that this is something that's moving with the people who have read it.

19:05.427 --> 19:08.290
What do you want the reader of America to come away with?

19:08.310 --> 19:12.355
Well, I guess if there's any one central thing.

19:13.096 --> 19:14.397
I mean, message.

19:14.497 --> 19:15.499
Is there a message?

19:15.519 --> 19:17.141
I guess there is, yeah.

19:17.181 --> 19:18.983
It is a story.

19:19.143 --> 19:22.587
It's a story primarily for me as a person who wrote it.

19:22.887 --> 19:26.670
I paid attention to the story and I tried to follow the story.

19:26.750 --> 19:30.894
And as often as I could, I tried to let incidents speak for themselves.

19:31.235 --> 19:40.583
I tried to step in only when I felt like there were times when something particularly horrible happened and I felt like I really do have to say something here at this point.

19:40.623 --> 19:43.646
I owe that to myself and whoever is reading this.

19:43.666 --> 19:49.891
By and large, I tried not to comment too much on too many of the stories.

19:50.392 --> 19:52.894
But I think the thing I came away from is

19:53.093 --> 20:10.457
was an awareness that the violence we do to the people closest to us is a violence in some ways that never ends.

20:11.097 --> 20:13.701
People can carry that stuff inside them.

20:14.153 --> 20:15.896
for a long, long time.

20:15.976 --> 20:20.643
And as in Gary's case, sometimes that violence, I mean, Gary's responsible for what he did.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.565
There's no question.

20:21.585 --> 20:26.453
Because you point out that he had said in prison that he was going to go to counsel for a couple of months.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.296
That was a report I got from a man himself.

20:28.336 --> 20:29.718
Well, yeah, that's probably pretty good.

20:29.738 --> 20:32.382
I mean, I'm an old journalist, and I believe you.

20:32.362 --> 20:34.404
Yeah, I believed it when this guy told me.

20:34.424 --> 20:35.906
You know, I mean, it sounded real.

20:35.926 --> 20:38.109
It had their dream.

20:38.129 --> 20:41.452
Whether or not he knew that these people were Mormons or whatever, but he had a chip.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.675
He had a monumental chip on the show.

20:43.835 --> 20:49.722
Oh, yeah.

20:49.762 --> 20:53.005
How are we supposed to respond to this?

20:53.025 --> 20:59.753
Well, I don't ask anybody to respond to Gary with...

20:59.986 --> 21:02.850
You don't seek the apprehension of Gary.

21:02.950 --> 21:04.973
No, no, there's no way that can happen.

21:04.993 --> 21:09.740
I mean, Gary did awful things, and he paid an awful price for them.

21:10.261 --> 21:11.583
I haven't forgiven Gary for those things.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.765
I have no right to.

21:12.785 --> 21:24.342
I can't imagine the family of the people that he killed could or should forgive him, and maybe the society should not either.

21:24.422 --> 21:29.790
But I guess the one thing that I would want people to pay attention to is

21:30.310 --> 21:39.160
is how this happens to a person's life, how somebody grows up and becomes somebody who does such horrible things.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.242
I don't think these things are accidental.

21:41.262 --> 21:42.363
I don't think they're impulsive.

21:42.423 --> 21:46.668
I don't think they just come out of some deep, genetic core of evil.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.871
What do you suggest, though?

21:48.891 --> 21:53.856
I mean, you do go back several hundred years, and there is a... Well, I think there's a legacy.

21:53.876 --> 21:56.179
...a continuum here of... Yes, exactly.

21:57.701 --> 21:58.742
A lot of that's just learned.

21:59.182 --> 21:59.963
I mean...

22:00.162 --> 22:04.268
Part of me does think that, yeah, we pass on unconscious things.

22:04.829 --> 22:11.979
Just in the same way that we can inherit a physical trait of a parent, eye color, hair color, face shape.

22:14.403 --> 22:16.145
I certainly believe we can inherit.

22:16.205 --> 22:18.388
But we are also responsible for what we do.

22:18.869 --> 22:21.192
I think you made it clear on that.

22:21.253 --> 22:22.755
We are responsible for what we do.

22:22.895 --> 22:25.419
I guess Gary was saying that himself.

22:25.779 --> 22:29.224
I mean, you know, he did... He did...

22:30.149 --> 22:42.639
insist on, I mean, for many, many reasons, and I don't think this was his only reason or even his primary reason, but it was at least part of the statement he made was that he accepted a responsibility and he was going to pay for that.

22:42.659 --> 22:47.972
And he paid the ultimate price for it.

22:48.172 --> 22:52.838
And I think he's the only firing squad execution.

22:54.961 --> 23:00.167
I think I would be very surprised if we ever put an email to the firing squad.

23:00.668 --> 23:03.391
But he kind of demanded that, didn't he?

23:03.411 --> 23:04.192
Oh, yeah.

23:04.673 --> 23:12.643
I really do believe there was, maybe not any conscious level, but kind of a romance with that fate.

23:12.663 --> 23:17.689
You know, I mean, it was not...

23:19.255 --> 23:30.767
It wasn't a shock or a surprise, certainly in many ways, what happened in Gary's life, the murders, the death sentence, the execution.

23:31.728 --> 23:37.214
It was as if he'd been hitting there, and I say this many times in the book, as if he had been hitting there for a long time.

23:37.254 --> 23:42.259
And what I realized during this work was we had also been hitting there.

23:42.279 --> 23:47.625
My mother had a deep, deep abhorrence.

23:47.960 --> 23:54.589
about the death penalty that went almost to the point of some kind of maddened phobia.

23:54.609 --> 23:57.794
She was consumed at times with it.

23:57.814 --> 23:59.496
She told those stories all the time.

24:00.077 --> 24:05.545
I remember one thing I forgot to say in the book and I wish I had remembered.

24:05.565 --> 24:08.990
I pointed out that my mother, the only time she ever voted was to vote for Kennedy in 1960.

24:09.711 --> 24:10.812
But then I remembered later.

24:11.373 --> 24:17.882
Actually, I saw a newspaper report and it reminded me that the reason she had voted was there was a referendum

24:18.233 --> 24:20.195
on the ballot about the death penalty in Oregon.

24:20.215 --> 24:22.237
In fact, that was the year Oregon abolished the death penalty.

24:22.918 --> 24:26.702
And that was the whole reason she went to vote.

24:27.183 --> 24:28.945
She felt so strongly about it.

24:28.985 --> 24:35.292
And I think she always had a fear, a sense that was going to come along and take somebody in her life.

24:35.312 --> 24:41.679
Now, you know, obviously, you know, Gary made all his choices.

24:41.699 --> 24:45.824
You know, he made a lot of rotten choices every step of the way.

24:46.284 --> 24:47.886
And I had great, great anger.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.869
with him for that.

24:49.889 --> 25:00.542
I think I've come to understand a little bit better about how clearly our parents can influence us in so many ways.

25:00.582 --> 25:10.374
They can influence us to who we marry or what occupation we pursue or how smart we are or whether we go to school.

25:11.615 --> 25:16.641
I think just as much clearly our parents can influence us.

25:18.865 --> 25:22.812
He said somebody could end up having a rendezvous with a death penalty.

25:22.852 --> 25:25.196
How well did you know Gary?

25:25.397 --> 25:26.278
Not well at all.

25:26.298 --> 25:27.380
He was never around as a kid.

25:27.621 --> 25:28.402
He was the one brother.

25:28.462 --> 25:30.125
What's the difference in age?

25:30.305 --> 25:30.686
Ten years.

25:31.167 --> 25:35.795
I think he was the one brother I longed to know the most.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.659
When I was a kid, I really wanted Gary to like me.

25:37.959 --> 25:39.322
I was fascinated by him.

25:39.422 --> 25:40.924
Did you fear him at all?

25:40.944 --> 25:42.247
I didn't fear him then.

25:42.387 --> 25:43.489
I certainly came to.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.212
He intrigued me.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.052
He was always quiet.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.634
He was always remote.

25:47.995 --> 25:51.919
He was a terrific artist, and that was the one thing about him I remembered and was fascinated by.

25:51.939 --> 25:56.424
I would sit and watch him draw, and I would try to get him to teach me, but he had no real interest.

25:56.444 --> 25:58.346
He was good at it, but he had no real interest in it.

25:58.366 --> 26:02.931
He certainly didn't want to communicate with it or share it with anybody.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.294
He was someone who came in and out.

26:06.795 --> 26:13.662
By the time I was four, he was already in reform school, and he was in and out a lot over the years, and more out.

26:13.979 --> 26:25.590
From the time he was 14 and I was four, until his death when he was 36, in those 22 years, he spent roughly 20 years incarceration.

26:25.610 --> 26:36.341
And in Oregon, when you're a kid, you cannot go visit somebody, even if they're your father, when they're in jail.

26:36.601 --> 26:38.263
You have to be at age 18.

26:38.283 --> 26:43.648
It has to be a real special circumstance, like an impending death or something.

26:44.641 --> 26:51.189
Gary went to prison for his armed robbery when I was 11, I think, or 12.

26:52.470 --> 26:58.137
And I did not have communication with him for six years.

26:58.778 --> 27:01.781
What did you think of him all this time, even before the murders?

27:02.302 --> 27:03.784
I think I can't have forgotten about him.

27:04.044 --> 27:05.586
I know my mother didn't.

27:06.247 --> 27:06.547
Did you?

27:07.869 --> 27:08.570
Before the murders?

27:09.090 --> 27:09.431
Yeah.

27:09.451 --> 27:11.393
Except that he's a badass dude?

27:11.413 --> 27:11.593
Yeah.

27:13.395 --> 27:13.956
At first,

27:14.122 --> 27:17.626
He wasn't a part of my life, so I didn't really relate to him.

27:17.646 --> 27:19.088
I knew he was in prison.

27:19.188 --> 27:23.393
I felt bad about it, but I also felt ashamed about it.

27:24.033 --> 27:28.558
I didn't start to get to know him until I was a young adult.

27:28.699 --> 27:42.154
And then an instant I relate in the book about when he got a school release, because he won an art scholarship while he was in prison at Oregon State Pantansbury, and they gave him a school release.

27:42.623 --> 27:46.509
to go to an art school in Eugene, Oregon, so that he could study art.

27:46.789 --> 27:49.373
And I was really happy for him.

27:49.433 --> 27:50.134
We all were.

27:50.154 --> 27:52.116
I'm writing for the Eugene paper, by the way.

27:52.277 --> 27:52.597
Oh, really?

27:54.139 --> 27:56.763
Yeah, I'd take a nice piece.

27:56.783 --> 27:56.883
Good.

27:56.903 --> 27:57.424
That might be a challenge.

27:57.684 --> 27:58.626
Yeah, I probably would be.

28:00.609 --> 28:02.872
They took him up to the school.

28:02.992 --> 28:07.659
He was supposed to go to a halfway house every night, check in, spend the night there.

28:07.859 --> 28:10.082
But he could go to school and have freedom on the campus.

28:10.703 --> 28:11.624
He never even registered.

28:11.644 --> 28:12.625
He walked off campus.

28:12.745 --> 28:14.266
He came up to Portland, saw my mother.

28:14.306 --> 28:15.147
He came over and saw me.

28:15.187 --> 28:19.411
And he essentially escaped from prison.

28:19.491 --> 28:23.034
And within a couple days, there was a warrant out for him.

28:23.054 --> 28:24.115
He was committing robberies again.

28:24.135 --> 28:28.739
He wanted me to buy him a gun during that period.

28:28.859 --> 28:31.461
And I was furious with him for even asking.

28:32.042 --> 28:35.985
So that was when I really first got to know him.

28:36.425 --> 28:37.767
And I didn't like what I knew.

28:37.807 --> 28:39.428
I always saw him as...

28:39.745 --> 29:06.647
bright and capable but i saw him as incorrigible i thought how did he react how did he respond to you i think he wanted he very much wanted me to be his brother but gary wanted people always was there any warmth there was a great deal there was real love i mean that was genuine but i mean he did love me i saw it even during that time i mean he seemed to see me i could see that he was really our brother gave him his diet just a few months before

29:06.982 --> 29:11.127
And I think he realized that he was losing his family and he had never been with them.

29:11.147 --> 29:12.509
And I think he did want to reach out.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.892
But he chose really a horrible way to do it.

29:15.393 --> 29:16.774
You come to your younger brother.

29:17.215 --> 29:24.384
You ask your younger brother to get you a gun to help him commit robberies and crimes and somebody can die as a result.

29:25.846 --> 29:27.909
I wasn't about to do that for anybody.

29:27.949 --> 29:31.333
And I deeply resented it.

29:31.753 --> 29:35.318
And more than that, it gave me conviction that he could not be saved.

29:35.433 --> 29:43.102
I thought, this is the best chance he's ever had in his life right here, and he's blown it so badly that he will never be saved.

29:43.122 --> 29:46.566
He will always be in prison.

29:46.586 --> 29:50.051
And I just pulled away, and I know that that hurt him.

29:50.191 --> 29:51.452
I know that angered him.

29:51.472 --> 29:57.880
We had an extremely difficult and bitter relationship from that point on until the last week of his life.

29:58.113 --> 30:05.620
Describe for me your own feelings when you knew that you were going to be executed.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.002
I was just sick to my heart.

30:08.263 --> 30:14.849
When you got the death penalty, when you got the sentence, of course nobody had been executed.

30:15.430 --> 30:20.935
And I tried to comfort my mother that they wouldn't start with Gary, but I think there was some part of me that knew otherwise.

30:20.955 --> 30:24.238
And then when I heard it, he was going to...

30:25.315 --> 30:28.638
give up his appeals and demand that the sentence go forward.

30:29.499 --> 30:31.481
I knew right then, but I was heart sick.

30:31.501 --> 30:34.864
I was full of rage and confusion.

30:35.825 --> 30:37.988
What was the rage?

30:38.108 --> 30:41.731
Deep rage against Gary for making his choice.

30:42.372 --> 30:43.693
The rage began well before then.

30:43.713 --> 30:54.664
When he killed those two men, I was outraged beyond belief.

30:55.673 --> 30:57.918
I really hated it for doing that.

30:57.959 --> 31:02.790
I could not imagine... I could not imagine doing that.

31:02.830 --> 31:07.682
I could not imagine... I can imagine people being angry and killing somebody to serve them.

31:08.805 --> 31:11.792
Or I can imagine somebody in the courts committing a robbery

31:12.110 --> 31:13.393
Something goes wrong.

31:13.413 --> 31:13.613
Right.

31:13.633 --> 31:16.340
Something goes wrong already if you're panicking in the shoes of me.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.144
I can't condone it, but I can imagine.

31:18.545 --> 31:19.146
I can't imagine.

31:19.206 --> 31:21.572
But you can certainly understand how it happens.

31:21.592 --> 31:27.064
I understand how Gary became somebody who was dangerous and deadly, but I can never understand how he

31:28.040 --> 31:45.943
I have an explanation, but not one that can ever go far enough to even begin to absolve it.

31:46.023 --> 31:49.508
As I say, I understand how he became a violent person.

31:49.910 --> 31:53.135
was sort of jammed in his heart from day one.

31:53.155 --> 31:58.082
So let's pull it together and say, what does this book do?

31:58.142 --> 32:05.092
I hope that this book tells something of a history of violence and its origins.

32:05.272 --> 32:11.461
I always conceived it as a genealogy of violence and sort of tracing how violence develops.

32:11.561 --> 32:17.389
I think of violence and... Just come on in again.

32:17.409 --> 32:18.010
I'm sorry.

32:18.293 --> 32:27.003
I've always thought that it's an extremely complex event.

32:27.464 --> 32:34.592
You know, for that moment to happen where somebody kills somebody, I think there's a complexity of history that leads up to it.

32:34.612 --> 32:37.095
And so many different things could make a difference.

32:37.115 --> 32:38.416
So many different things.

32:38.436 --> 32:45.364
You know, sometimes just being, watching across the street and being in the right place or the wrong place at a given time.

32:45.850 --> 32:49.453
or had something else happen in the real life.

32:49.994 --> 32:51.795
And that was what I wanted to do.

32:51.815 --> 32:53.076
I wanted to examine that history.

32:53.376 --> 33:00.382
And I know when I set out, I kept looking for those moments that would have made a difference.

33:00.402 --> 33:03.905
And I realized, of course, there were just way too many of them.

33:04.466 --> 33:09.170
But that was certainly part of what I wanted to understand.

33:09.290 --> 33:15.115
I wanted to look at violence as a consequence of family history.

33:15.972 --> 33:23.181
And do you feel that in some way this types you or casts you?

33:23.722 --> 33:24.143
Sure, I do.

33:24.483 --> 33:28.168
I mean, I don't feel obliged to live, according to that, Kath.

33:28.188 --> 33:37.720
I mean, I'm going to be the person I've always been, as somebody who loves to sit at home and write about music and tinker with computers and toys.

33:37.960 --> 33:44.629
And all my interests, whatever my literary interests are or...

33:45.132 --> 34:10.836
uh my interest in various arts you know i i i think it will cast me yes as the person who wrote about being the brother of a killer um yes of an executed killer and uh it seemed definitely one was one who was profiled by learning mailer yes how do you separate yourself from that book by the way mailer

34:11.052 --> 34:17.718
Well, it's quite easy always to separate myself from it in a certain way because I didn't participate on any level.

34:17.798 --> 34:24.444
I understand that, but that might be the flip side of the story.

34:24.724 --> 34:31.270
Well, I actually think the two books are in some ways complementing one another.

34:31.390 --> 34:33.572
He tells that story.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.694
What do you think of that?

34:35.714 --> 34:37.155
I think it's a great book.

34:37.215 --> 34:38.596
It's a long book.

34:39.057 --> 34:40.418
A little bit, you know.

34:41.090 --> 34:43.213
We've all been guilty of that.

34:43.574 --> 34:55.251
My book, as I say this, my book is one of the reasons to get orphaned in a random house.

34:55.271 --> 34:57.534
Link does not, I think, tell the whole story.

34:58.035 --> 35:00.699
I love to write long.

35:00.779 --> 35:03.603
I'm sure I would have gotten longer with this.

35:03.663 --> 35:06.628
I'm glad I didn't.

35:06.648 --> 35:08.751
I think it was about to write Link.

35:08.984 --> 35:13.529
But I, no, I think, excuse me, I think it's actually Mayer's best book.

35:14.289 --> 35:21.016
I mean, I haven't read it even before.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.458
I hate it.

35:23.099 --> 35:27.023
I hate it.

35:27.623 --> 35:28.004
It's terrible.

35:28.024 --> 35:28.164
Uh-huh.

35:28.244 --> 35:30.126
And he's trying to do some of his reasons.

35:30.146 --> 35:36.072
Well, we'll start talking about things, but... No, I'm sorry to ask you.

35:36.203 --> 35:42.832
I'll tell you, reading that... There was a course that had a tremendous impact on my life with reading that book.

35:43.313 --> 35:56.290
You're reading a story that is... In some ways, I was reading my story because I was reading about somebody I was related to and somebody who was... And I was reading about my family.

35:56.771 --> 36:04.521
And I... And I learned things in that book that I had not learned that nobody had ever told me.

36:04.761 --> 36:05.923
And that was...

36:06.410 --> 36:11.775
for me, the part of the experience that stayed with me the longest.

36:11.815 --> 36:14.357
I learned that my brother David had been stabbed in Chicago.

36:14.457 --> 36:15.238
Nobody had ever told me that.

36:15.318 --> 36:24.247
I thought that he died of an ulcer or an ulcerous condition, you know, made worse by his alcoholism.

36:26.429 --> 36:29.652
I did not know that my father had had many wives before.

36:29.692 --> 36:31.854
I knew he had a couple other children.

36:31.874 --> 36:32.915
That's all I knew.

36:32.935 --> 36:34.476
I had no idea he had

36:34.844 --> 36:40.209
He has an extensive family past of his own and so many marriages.

36:40.910 --> 36:48.838
And I knew he lived under different names, but I had no idea that my father had anything that was given in his history past.

36:49.118 --> 36:56.865
Well, then do you believe that Gary was a particular consequence of one people?

36:56.905 --> 36:58.027
I think in some ways.

36:58.107 --> 37:04.733
I think, in many ways, I think Gary, if there's one real defeat for me in this book, and it's a big one,

37:05.185 --> 37:08.670
is that I never got to know my father well enough in the research.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.532
I could not find enough about him.

37:10.592 --> 37:13.657
I could not solve the mysteries about him that I wanted to solve for myself.

37:14.398 --> 37:22.709
I do think... To me, the two most elusive people in my book remain Gary and my father.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.313
Gary will always be elusive to me in many ways.

37:26.294 --> 37:32.162
And my father, I couldn't get... Who do you know least?

37:32.583 --> 37:32.723
Least?

37:32.743 --> 37:32.863
Least.

37:33.974 --> 37:34.755
Probably my father.

37:34.775 --> 37:39.461
I mean, I knew him well because he loved me and pretended to be good.

37:39.481 --> 37:46.590
Whoever he was inside, I can imagine it at times, but it all feels like guesswork.

37:46.950 --> 37:51.897
But the single greatest feeling for me was not getting his story.

37:54.260 --> 37:59.506
I think that in many ways, Gary was sort of an echo of my father.

37:59.526 --> 38:02.310
I think my father saw things from Gary that

38:02.729 --> 38:32.500
that reminded him of himself a defiance i know my father certainly got tossed out of school uh a lot uh he was a defiant rebellious young man he wanted to have a criminal life before he had a family and i think that he probably saw some of gary saw some of himself in gary and i have a hunch he hated that part that he wanted he wanted to impose a strong discipline on his children he wanted to raise them in the parochial uh tradition and he wanted to uh

38:33.408 --> 38:37.773
And he did not want anybody to defy his authority.

38:38.794 --> 38:55.732
And I think my father was a man who was in some ways so desperate to be loved and so afraid of love that he used authority as kind of the rule for them.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.894
Tell me what the title of the question is.

38:58.275 --> 39:01.558
A friend suggested the title when I was young.

39:02.112 --> 39:30.803
midway through writing a proposal, I had shown to an old girlfriend, and she, and I'm not going to, I mean, I did all the chapter titles, all that, and I was fairly happy with him, but I've never, yeah, I was looking for, I was certainly looking for things that were either a little more academic or a little more subtle, you know, and when she said, she said, you should just call it shot in the heart, and as soon as she said it, I knew that

39:31.188 --> 39:33.370
It resonates through your whole story.

39:34.111 --> 39:37.054
And I'm extremely grateful for that title.

39:38.135 --> 39:46.303
It gave me a focus in some way that... Well, how does such a resonant metaphor?

39:46.323 --> 39:48.325
I mean, it's not just an origin.

39:48.345 --> 39:49.346
I mean, it's certainly a metaphor, isn't it?

39:49.727 --> 39:50.107
Oh, yeah.

39:50.367 --> 39:50.928
Oh, yeah.

39:50.948 --> 39:54.251
It's a metaphor, and it just runs very deep.

39:55.072 --> 39:55.292
Yeah.

39:56.413 --> 39:59.416
Well, I'll tell you, Michael, I think we've covered it.

40:01.078 --> 40:01.178
Okay.
