00:06.967 --> 00:18.120
But, you know, Cotton was, the burning of the Catonian Library was saving her books was a wonderful story.

00:18.140 --> 00:24.547
I have a book, myself, which gives a different story about fire than any other known.

00:24.788 --> 00:28.873
You know, Bentley was the librarian.

00:28.893 --> 00:34.459
And it's Morris Johnson's copy of Cassidy's Catonian Cadillac.

00:34.996 --> 00:46.010
The first page is covered with Morris Johnson's story of what he heard from Caswell about how the fire started, which was that Bentley came in late.

00:46.030 --> 00:46.992
He'd come from Cambridge.

00:48.233 --> 00:49.315
And it was cold.

00:50.356 --> 00:57.125
He turned up, he left the fire on, he left the blower on the fire when he went to bed.

00:57.145 --> 00:58.767
And that's where the fire actually started.

00:58.787 --> 01:02.472
And if so, Bentley, who is of course most famous for attacking the ancients,

01:03.211 --> 01:17.871
I'm going to ask you to do, when I turn this over, I did something, this is the first time this has happened, a hundred hours of tape.

01:20.775 --> 01:26.443
Do the Texas thing once more.

01:26.463 --> 01:30.168
You don't have to do the whole thing.

01:30.188 --> 01:32.391
Well, I think the principle that I was saying, that was,

01:32.742 --> 01:45.540
Well, what I'm saying is that Texas I do not think is unique in its reluctance to let unpublished material be made freely available.

01:46.161 --> 02:02.243
But many institutions regard their investment in material with scholarly potential in it as a kind of investment process which will eventually improve the student body and the quality of education in place by luring in

02:02.948 --> 02:11.679
business academics to do the same thing, and I think you'll find perhaps a little less publicity than a number of other institutions, too.

02:11.699 --> 02:23.274
And I said that... You got a statement that started, the rationale is the... Well, the rationale is that by bringing unpublished material to a place, you attract people to come.

02:23.294 --> 02:31.825
Perhaps a distinguished scholar, professor, and so on will spend a couple of years with you because he's teaching and at the same time working on the material you've got.

02:32.024 --> 02:39.191
He comes in, the graduate students want to come there because he's there, and the graduate students who come are better than what you would otherwise get.

02:39.831 --> 02:45.177
They turn in the better on teachers of the undergraduates who slightly ameliorate the undergraduate education.

02:45.897 --> 02:48.299
Maybe better people start applying to go to the school.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.901
I mean, you get the whole thing.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.723
You get the process going.

02:52.023 --> 02:53.565
It's an idea.

02:54.065 --> 03:00.411
One thing they claim to be very proud of is that they say that on average,

03:00.796 --> 03:13.210
60 books a year are published that have been based, not necessarily primarily, but in large major on research conducted there.

03:13.230 --> 03:22.180
And they have a little glass case of recent books.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.363
The book on James Joyce's wife, I guess, and Michael Hallward's job.

03:25.383 --> 03:28.947
The first one, Hallward, he really kind of ticked out, but he has spent so much time down there.

03:29.180 --> 03:35.147
because they wouldn't gladly take this point.

03:35.948 --> 03:38.190
And then you did mention something about Leon Adel.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.975
Well, I'm not sure that this is absolutely... I would check it out.

03:43.316 --> 03:57.972
I believe that Adel has a kind of an understanding that as he was editing all of him, he might have something to say about

03:58.492 --> 04:09.269
there was some advice to put in about the use of unpublished material that he was going to get to in a volume that might be a year or two.

04:09.289 --> 04:21.107
Hence, you can imagine how you feel if you were working on a whole overview of the correspondence and people kept snapping up the best letters, the most revealing letters,

04:21.560 --> 04:27.429
prior to your book and publishing them in separate articles, which you might argue your own book made unnecessary.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.994
But then I said, gee, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that.

04:31.094 --> 04:35.541
You said, perhaps, but that's not too dissimilar to what Texas is doing.

04:35.601 --> 04:36.683
No, that's right.

04:36.703 --> 04:49.542
I mean, the administration of your manuscripts with a view to what you think is the best way that should be published is actually a duteless one or so, a privilege.

04:50.028 --> 04:57.617
Now, there are places where the British Library, to the best of my knowledge, does not restrict the use of anything.

04:57.637 --> 05:07.509
Although, uncatalogued material might be sort of a typical subject.

05:07.529 --> 05:19.984
You know, I mean, you might ask yourself, I believe it was true until fairly recently, and maybe even still true, that the Mongolian manuscripts at Cambridge University were unavailable because they had never been catalogued since the middle of the 18th century.

05:20.302 --> 05:29.672
And I had a colleague in the 60s who tried to use that material, and he was a serious and very proud of Mongolian scholar.

05:30.593 --> 05:41.926
And I seem to remember that in the 60s, mid-60s, it was still impossible to look at 18th century and early 19th century Mongolian acquisitions of Cambridge because they weren't cataloged.

05:42.006 --> 05:46.731
And this, by the way, was catch-22 because they weren't cataloged because nobody could read them.

05:47.133 --> 05:50.759
And the people who could read them couldn't see them because they want to tell them.

05:50.799 --> 05:51.840
That's a good story.

05:51.901 --> 05:52.482
I like that.

05:52.562 --> 05:54.324
Check it with Cambridge, but I think you want to find it.

05:54.344 --> 05:56.628
There are pocket collections all over the place.

05:56.648 --> 06:02.077
I wish I could see Brian Jenkins and Jackie Reckler.

06:02.097 --> 06:04.901
Well, that's not, again, that's not unique to them.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.245
Well, Texas still has stuff to bring in.

06:07.265 --> 06:12.313
There was a, remember, you probably do know about it, a kind of a little

06:12.783 --> 06:17.970
a fire event a few years ago about the state of the home catalog material.

06:18.290 --> 06:28.423
At which time, you probably know, there were substantial acquisitions which had never been uncreated or in type of analysis.

06:28.443 --> 06:31.507
But I think that's been accurate work very hard.

06:31.667 --> 06:32.589
Yeah, clearly.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.070
I mean, this is another question.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.073
Suppose you are trying to build a library

06:36.273 --> 06:42.220
you try to build a library from very little, really fast.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.646
Well, your first task is to buy as fast as you can before the material vanishes.

06:47.746 --> 06:48.607
A lot of money is available.

06:48.627 --> 06:55.395
You've got the money maybe to buy it, but cataloging is incredibly expensive.

06:55.415 --> 07:02.464
A lot of places take the position, let's buy now and repent and buy and haze, repent and leisure, catalog and leisure.

07:02.764 --> 07:05.267
One of the things that Hamilton

07:06.192 --> 07:16.005
said and stand by, and what you've heard to some degree from other people, but certainly not to the degree.

07:16.025 --> 07:23.294
He claims, he says that they bought nothing with worthless stuff, which is patently outrageous.

07:23.314 --> 07:24.416
Pardon me.

07:24.436 --> 07:28.481
But he did say that they did buy a lot of worthless stuff.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.664
Nicholas says, you know,

07:33.614 --> 07:35.035
because it's unknown."

07:35.135 --> 07:42.402
He said, but we're finding stuff today from 16th century writers, which all of a sudden is quite interesting.

07:42.422 --> 07:50.049
I mean, everyone makes fun of the writer's laundry list, saying who wants to know what King James Amos paid for butter in one week.

07:50.069 --> 07:53.993
But on the other hand, wouldn't he be sort of interested to know what Chaucer paid for butter?

07:54.253 --> 07:56.855
Suddenly it becomes kind of anointed by age.

07:57.136 --> 08:00.339
Let me just, is this driving you crazy?

08:00.579 --> 08:03.081
Can I, shall I move to my own thing?

08:03.483 --> 08:10.831
Oh, that's a pretty one.

08:10.851 --> 08:11.973
Are you okay, Tom?

08:11.993 --> 08:19.481
Do you want to go someplace?

08:19.501 --> 08:22.685
Because there is an area I want to get into at some point too late.

08:22.705 --> 08:27.350
Let me see if there's a woman.

08:29.252 --> 08:30.874
How long would I have a woman?

08:31.647 --> 08:37.575
I would think about 12 years, maybe 10.

08:37.595 --> 08:38.696
I could be off by that.

08:39.357 --> 08:40.999
Is it named Haven O'Moore?

08:42.581 --> 08:46.066
Now you'd better turn it off.

08:46.086 --> 09:00.304
I'm just guessing that traditional science, as Haven O'Moore views it, I suspect is the idea, it's rather like the idea of

09:01.415 --> 09:03.257
of privilege knowledge.

09:03.818 --> 09:25.701
The notion that there is a body of knowledge that moves from age to age and culture to culture, and somehow that you can find communities in it, that there's something between the Vedas and the Infinegan's Wake, that there's a pulse of somehow... I mean, it's a very traditional... Traditional is a very good word, in all sense, because this is... But maybe science isn't...

09:26.052 --> 09:33.420
Science is learning, knowledge, and you can define that as something you happen to prefer or like.

09:33.540 --> 09:45.073
I mean, people who are Neo-Platonist theorists, Rosicrucians, Masonic orders of all sorts exist.

09:46.174 --> 09:53.983
I mean, exist who believe that there is a body, a way of looking at things that moves from time to time without altering very much.

09:54.537 --> 10:08.251
I think Haven's books reflect a kind of prescriptive understanding of the whole body of writing and thinking.

10:08.692 --> 10:12.676
You'll notice, for example, there's very little illustration in Haven's books.

10:12.696 --> 10:23.667
I don't, as far as I know, I may be completely off base, but I've never actually... No, the books he acquired, not his own, because there's quite a bit of illustration on his own.

10:24.372 --> 10:37.348
As I understand it, I think his perception of continuity of knowledge is not so much a visual one, it's a rather abstractly philosophical one.

10:37.368 --> 10:40.392
It affects certain authors more than others.

10:40.412 --> 10:42.495
Do you think he became a collector?

10:43.096 --> 10:45.279
And again, now we are Dr. Bumpel collector.

10:45.299 --> 10:47.621
That would be nice.

10:47.642 --> 10:48.903
Why did he become a collector?

10:49.043 --> 10:53.569
To acquire these milestones of world

10:54.106 --> 10:59.735
or to study them, to go in and capture this tradition?

11:00.736 --> 11:03.340
Well, let me just describe it.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.982
This is a valid question.

11:05.103 --> 11:16.680
No, I mean, if you mean, does a man go out and buy a copy of The City of God in Latin in order to read it, don't be silly.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.062
Of course it doesn't.

11:18.263 --> 11:20.586
It's the sort of touchstone idea that you can actually

11:21.089 --> 11:22.610
be in the presence of the text.

11:22.831 --> 11:31.959
Many people feel, I do, that you look at the wall and the spine, you sort of draw some kind of inspiration.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.862
Seeing things that you may not even touch.

11:34.882 --> 11:37.385
It may never take off the shelf.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.706
That's how I became a collective.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.629
Walking into the libraries and friends who collect.

11:41.649 --> 11:44.592
And I used to say, I feel the camera race.

11:44.612 --> 11:45.933
It's like a microwave.

11:46.153 --> 11:48.075
Fantastic information, too.

11:48.308 --> 11:54.016
Yeah, really, something cool in the summer, warm in the winter.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.183
It's just something.

11:59.203 --> 12:14.565
I'm approaching this delicate, and I'm just wondering at what point did he start acquiring, once you get established, a wish to the Michael Davis, and then you have the werewolves all of them to buy these different books.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.628
About that, I actually...

12:16.945 --> 12:20.130
I'm being quite honest here.

12:20.150 --> 12:22.874
I don't have to do that.

12:22.894 --> 12:26.178
I don't know at what point and what the details of any of the financing were.

12:26.198 --> 12:27.380
I mean, I know probably far less than you do.

12:28.742 --> 12:32.127
What I do know is that there was a kind of pattern to this collecting.

12:32.147 --> 12:40.479
It began with an interest in Blake and in, for that matter, Trianon Press, like some of those in Blake, and in press books.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.525
And I think he gradually became considerably more sophisticated.

12:44.545 --> 12:45.366
Press books were

12:46.409 --> 12:56.083
sort of an initial, early enthusiasm, which he then took one big opportunity to make them very, very splashy.

12:56.103 --> 12:59.869
But he got more and more selective as he got more experienced.

13:00.690 --> 13:07.059
And certainly there are things in the garden sale which don't seem to make much sense in terms of the other books.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.965
You sort of ask yourself, why do you need some radiative pictures on values?

13:11.587 --> 13:15.291
And the answer might be, as with many collectors, you get bored.

13:16.052 --> 13:18.254
There hasn't been anything on offer that you very much want.

13:18.775 --> 13:24.361
And the other answer might be that if he'd been able to continue... The other answer might be anything like that.

13:24.441 --> 13:24.661
Yeah.

13:24.801 --> 13:39.277
Well, another point is that when you buy these miscellaneous things, sometimes if they are part of some amazing total vision that you have of the world, it may take you another 20 years to bring them into the scope of the building around them.

13:39.297 --> 13:40.058
I don't know.

13:40.342 --> 13:44.889
Certainly there are books, there were books in our collection, and books excluded from the cell.

13:46.391 --> 13:48.735
Song books were.

13:48.755 --> 13:55.786
Which don't seem to fit with any kind of cosmic view of anything, but that's inevitable.

13:56.107 --> 13:58.009
What if you're going in to capture the energy?

13:58.550 --> 13:59.953
I'm supposed to capture the energy.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.635
A few sparks.

14:01.775 --> 14:05.421
I think that's good.

14:05.958 --> 14:12.065
There's no way I'm going to convince you one way or the other about what I'm supposed to do.

14:13.447 --> 14:14.328
You don't get anxious.

14:14.388 --> 14:15.710
You don't want to see the guy's done in.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.792
Well done in isn't the point.

14:17.812 --> 14:22.718
I don't want to be... I don't want to talk out of school about somebody when it doesn't know they're the right to.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.559
That's right.

14:23.659 --> 14:26.523
And I am talking about books, my position of books.

14:26.543 --> 14:29.907
I am going to tell this story as much as I can.

14:30.067 --> 14:34.092
I am my trope of the fact that he's a private individual.

14:34.747 --> 14:37.951
You know, there are limits to which I can go as well as a writer.

14:42.016 --> 14:56.034
I have acquired the instrument that established the garden, which made it very hard to find.

14:56.535 --> 15:02.442
And the way I found it...

15:03.873 --> 15:15.391
I don't think that there's any reason why Hayden would be secretive about his academic background.

15:15.471 --> 15:18.676
He went to the University of Oklahoma, I believe, after the war.

15:20.018 --> 15:22.241
Was he on WW2?

15:22.842 --> 15:23.163
Yeah.

15:23.824 --> 15:25.927
And he was also in the Korean War.

15:26.027 --> 15:30.053
He has told a number of people he worked on McCarty's staff, I guess.

15:30.654 --> 15:31.956
He certainly met him.

15:33.286 --> 15:35.109
I don't know the details of that.

15:35.129 --> 15:35.589
I do know.

15:35.609 --> 15:37.131
I don't know who I can talk about.

15:37.151 --> 15:39.795
But yes, he had some contact with me.

15:39.815 --> 15:45.043
He was at the University of Oklahoma, I believe, and at Berkeley at one time, and at Brandon's at one time.

15:45.063 --> 15:49.529
And as you know, there's a DR in front of this man with a full stop.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.230
And I didn't know this.

15:51.532 --> 15:52.073
Do it again.

15:52.153 --> 15:52.694
There's a what?

15:53.415 --> 15:54.516
Doctor.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.161
So, there may be somewhere a record again.

15:58.181 --> 16:00.645
With a full stop, or you say, stop.

16:00.665 --> 16:02.888
No, like, like he is.

16:03.239 --> 16:05.783
I don't know how he is.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.025
I have never seen Preston.

16:07.065 --> 16:09.509
I've never seen it.

16:09.829 --> 16:14.056
No, I don't know the details of his degrees or what.

16:14.677 --> 16:17.842
But I believe he was at his feet.

16:17.862 --> 16:19.484
How old would you think he is?

16:21.147 --> 16:24.392
I'm told he looks a lot younger than he probably is.

16:25.574 --> 16:29.299
Yeah, I think I could guess.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.643
But it would be me guessing rather than information.

16:32.534 --> 16:47.775
I would say he was 60 now.

16:48.115 --> 16:49.557
60, maybe.

16:49.577 --> 17:00.712
I think he's been in the Second World War and he's 60 now, I wonder.

17:00.732 --> 17:01.113
Other age, I think.

17:01.133 --> 17:01.393
Okay, maybe.

17:02.622 --> 17:12.778
I think the tales about his service experience I have to not want to discuss, because I know them from what he's told.

17:12.798 --> 17:21.492
If they're really true or not, then it's a matter of record.

17:21.512 --> 17:23.155
He's got, presumably, army in his service.

17:23.175 --> 17:28.984
Without pushing you, does he claim to have any decorations?

17:30.702 --> 17:33.344
I mean, he's never made much of a point about it.

17:33.404 --> 17:38.649
I know something about what he's discussed as war experience, but that's very personal.

17:38.669 --> 17:39.190
Okay.

17:39.370 --> 17:40.070
And, let's see.

17:40.090 --> 17:45.916
I'm told that he made it.

17:46.096 --> 17:48.157
Have you tried to interview him?

17:48.618 --> 17:54.383
You know, I think, believe it or not, I think he would be contraceptive.

17:54.443 --> 17:58.887
I think many of these questions he'd tell you the whole thing.

17:59.373 --> 18:03.299
If he wouldn't, then I shouldn't.

18:03.359 --> 18:04.661
No, I think he will.

18:06.925 --> 18:20.365
But the way a professional investigator, like my investigative reporter works, a journalist, is that you generally like to have everything that you want to know.

18:21.867 --> 18:22.849
And I think I've got it.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.992
I mean, I think I've got it.

18:25.495 --> 18:35.745
But you gave me a very interesting, fascinating evaluation of the man about the magnetism that he exudes, he projects.

18:36.646 --> 18:42.032
And I'm wondering if maybe this might not have come into play with this Michael Davis.

18:45.115 --> 18:49.860
I know nothing about that whole aspect.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.165
Let's ask one question, and this you could probably say, you know, for the record,

18:56.022 --> 18:59.966
But did you ever know there was such a person as a Michael Davis?

19:00.427 --> 19:05.793
Or did you think that Hayden was the person who was the major player in the bookmarker?

19:05.813 --> 19:13.061
I did not know the existence of Michael Davis until it was one.

19:13.221 --> 19:20.509
And you are not, you join a family that includes everyone who knows.

19:20.689 --> 19:21.810
Nobody knows.

19:24.102 --> 19:31.190
Well, Paul Galari in New York said, we all wondered where the money was coming from, and now we don't like it.

19:31.210 --> 19:34.714
Maybe that's the case.

19:34.734 --> 19:41.060
Well, it is true that there was, I mean, it's one thing that people speculate on first.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.005
A new player in the game shows up, especially at this level.

19:45.025 --> 19:46.607
A major player.

19:46.647 --> 19:52.573
People always speculate about the money, and you will hear, before all this blew up,

19:53.583 --> 19:56.846
There were calculus theories, many of them.

19:56.866 --> 20:03.011
I think the sentence I will end this chapter with will be a quote of John Clemens.

20:03.031 --> 20:07.195
And I will only paraphrase it now because it's quite wonderful.

20:07.215 --> 20:10.918
And he has said it in the presence of any number of people.

20:11.679 --> 20:12.599
We have to forgive him.

20:12.639 --> 20:15.021
Somebody said, is he crazy?

20:15.842 --> 20:17.203
Asked if he's crazy.

20:17.223 --> 20:21.207
He said, whatever he is, don't condemn him.

20:21.367 --> 20:22.628
He loves books so much.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.201
something like that.

20:25.261 --> 20:26.202
The man loves books.

20:26.903 --> 20:28.104
We have to forgive him.

20:28.385 --> 20:29.906
Something like that.

20:29.926 --> 20:30.747
I have it down.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.770
I quite agree.

20:32.970 --> 20:38.136
It's a fair thing to say about Haven, but with all respect, it's typical of John B. Severn.

20:39.818 --> 20:40.679
Is that right?

20:40.719 --> 20:41.460
I think I missed.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.443
I wish I'd started this project two years ago.

20:44.463 --> 20:47.867
When I said it was typical, I didn't mean that in a complimentary way.

20:47.887 --> 20:49.068
Is that right?

20:49.128 --> 20:52.412
I very much like John, but he did have a tendency to

20:52.882 --> 21:01.269
No, he had a tendency to sort of, well, I was going to say this.

21:01.329 --> 21:02.110
I think one asks.

21:02.591 --> 21:04.712
I've got to do that.

21:05.813 --> 21:09.437
I'm told he has children from a previous marriage.

21:09.557 --> 21:11.819
Is that something you've heard?

21:12.299 --> 21:13.160
I've heard these stories.

21:15.081 --> 21:15.622
But not again.

21:15.682 --> 21:18.344
I think I'm going to talk to him.

21:20.086 --> 21:21.387
Let's leave Haven.

21:21.957 --> 21:27.324
I think personal details are things that... How would you judge his collection?

21:28.345 --> 21:30.829
It's small and select.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.672
A collection that was sold in November, let's say.

21:34.653 --> 21:37.758
Well, it was in many ways quite terrific.

21:38.959 --> 21:46.729
He tried to get the best possible copy of every book, and in some cases he certainly succeeded.

21:46.749 --> 21:50.454
If he can succeed in more than a few, that's very remarkable.

21:50.975 --> 21:51.255
I think

21:51.556 --> 21:54.781
It's curious how complete it feels, even though it clearly wasn't.

21:54.941 --> 21:59.768
No one intended to expose it so early.

22:00.088 --> 22:01.851
Pretty good.

22:01.871 --> 22:08.520
I guess the greatest surprise of the sale was your purchase of the Don Quixote, the $1.5 million.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.686
That's the way you look for $300.

22:12.927 --> 22:16.632
How do you count for something like that?

22:16.652 --> 22:18.795
Well, the selfies that far off,

22:20.277 --> 22:27.248
There were two very determined collectors who wish to buy it.

22:27.268 --> 22:29.171
One who didn't want to get it.

22:29.251 --> 22:39.286
In general, that's good, isn't it, that if an institution disposes of the evidence.

22:39.306 --> 22:40.889
We all have, I think, mixed feelings about it.

22:40.969 --> 22:46.858
We'd like to know that there's something called constancy or there is a

22:47.378 --> 22:53.327
constant situation when we say there's only one copy in private hands out of heat.

22:53.407 --> 22:58.855
It's kind of embarrassing suddenly to discover that there are six more available.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.217
And this may very well happen.

23:00.237 --> 23:02.040
How quickly did the Tamerlaids show up?

23:02.080 --> 23:05.445
You know, I think they show up to people.

23:05.765 --> 23:06.987
Well, no, that's not true.

23:07.127 --> 23:11.013
Tamerlane has turned up for a long time.

23:11.033 --> 23:13.277
There was a set number, and then there were a couple of discoveries.

23:13.938 --> 23:16.862
And the most recent one was really discovered absolutely

23:17.348 --> 23:18.830
for no money.

23:18.850 --> 23:21.713
There is, of course, a copy of Tamerlane that's somewhere out there.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.815
There was a Virginia copy that was stolen.

23:24.276 --> 23:35.728
My understanding of that copy was that where somebody sold it, I mean, it was thought that that might be a missing Virginia copy, and it was subjected to every known test, and it came to plain.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.309
I'm sorry.

23:36.910 --> 23:43.677
But the question of there not being just part of way about Keokia and Spain,

23:43.943 --> 23:49.449
We sold a copy not long ago.

23:51.291 --> 23:58.259
One of the very few copies now, which I think is in their senses, but that was given to Juan Carlos.

23:58.759 --> 24:03.705
So presumably if the king keeps his books in Spain, there's a copy in Spain.

24:03.725 --> 24:06.428
But that would have been the first copy to have gone to Spain.

24:06.468 --> 24:06.628
I see.

24:06.648 --> 24:06.808
Okay.

24:06.828 --> 24:08.390
Going back to Spain.

24:08.410 --> 24:13.275
But if that's the case, and I'm certainly not asking you to confirm what I could outside,

24:14.622 --> 24:40.478
that's that's a nice story that's a happy ending isn't it yeah i mean this is their national book yes but i mean what i mean is that the king's copy is not the haven copy it's the copy which is so so the story is so charming is not correct it's so often happens doesn't it yeah i mean the story of harry wideness saying uh from shipwreck this will go with me i'm now told that even though quarry

24:41.217 --> 24:44.441
I'll help circulate that story and it's probably not true.

24:44.582 --> 24:45.583
No, we never circulate it.

24:45.603 --> 24:48.687
In fact, the article that you've been told about is by me.

24:50.650 --> 24:53.274
Harry Watt, Courage Endless.

24:53.294 --> 24:54.215
I'll give you a copy.

24:54.235 --> 24:55.597
May I?

24:55.617 --> 24:55.717
Yeah.

24:55.777 --> 24:57.820
Sort of explaining what actually did happen.

24:57.900 --> 24:58.942
Well, I think I need that.

24:59.302 --> 24:59.683
Okay.

25:00.123 --> 25:00.844
I'll give you a copy.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.026
I may have a copy.

25:02.166 --> 25:06.072
And Dick Manning, of course, urged me to see you when I came here.

25:06.092 --> 25:08.775
I spent about three hours with him.

25:08.795 --> 25:10.498
And he's one of my subjects.

25:10.518 --> 25:10.718
Good.

25:10.799 --> 25:15.445
So, what can you tell me about Dick as a collector?

25:15.465 --> 25:19.351
With the knowledge that he suggested I see you, okay?

25:19.932 --> 25:26.441
And if there's any problem, you know, about this, we'll scratch it.

25:26.461 --> 25:28.263
Well, the problem is this, really.

25:28.283 --> 25:31.307
When, you know, when you're asking me... Yeah, okay.

25:32.148 --> 25:33.330
But, basically...

25:34.306 --> 25:44.798
It isn't like I don't like talking about other people I'm delighted to, but I'll find myself having to say the sort of things people say in talk shows or in interviews.

25:44.938 --> 25:48.082
I owe it all to my offensive line.

25:49.604 --> 25:50.405
Forget about me.

25:50.485 --> 25:55.290
I know I hit 450, but if it weren't for the guys who sat in front of me, I wouldn't have a chance.

25:55.310 --> 25:57.653
They'd walk me every time.

25:57.673 --> 26:02.018
What was Lefty Gomez's secret of my success?

26:02.892 --> 26:09.200
I don't want to give you Pablum, and yet I can't tell you anything.

26:09.260 --> 26:12.103
Well, he is, well, it's much more impressive.

26:12.123 --> 26:13.425
He's two models, though.

26:13.545 --> 26:17.049
But he's a collector who's really only been collecting books for six or seven years.

26:17.069 --> 26:18.071
Yeah, so I got him.

26:18.091 --> 26:18.952
It is interesting.

26:19.012 --> 26:19.793
He told me.

26:19.933 --> 26:22.116
Well, he's a long-term, long-standing collector.

26:22.216 --> 26:26.982
Well, he's got two rooms at the next fall, I think.

26:29.004 --> 26:29.525
He told me.

26:30.426 --> 26:31.347
He made you a collector?

26:31.883 --> 26:33.946
Yes, I think so.

26:34.066 --> 26:35.748
I deal with him a lot.

26:35.969 --> 26:46.664
I think he's his... I mean, I'm not entirely sure of the... I don't quite understand the scope of what he's doing completely.

26:47.425 --> 26:55.657
But, yeah, he's a... Major isn't a word to use about collectors, I think, until... Well, all right.

26:55.677 --> 26:56.798
It's good to continue again.

26:56.898 --> 27:00.203
I mean, there are collectors who have

27:00.807 --> 27:02.769
very little money for major collectors.

27:03.330 --> 27:10.619
There's a guy in Oxford who has been collecting simply and fastidiously all his life.

27:11.480 --> 27:16.886
I think he once spent the equivalent of $4,000 in the book.

27:17.327 --> 27:19.870
He has an absolutely spectacular collection.

27:19.890 --> 27:24.535
Is he somebody I should look into?

27:24.555 --> 27:25.837
Which it might be awkward right now.

27:25.857 --> 27:27.799
It's not very well.

27:27.819 --> 27:30.122
And in his collection, they sort of

27:30.845 --> 27:38.694
But there are other people who have, I mean, who can just simply buy a book at any price.

27:38.714 --> 27:40.175
I'm doing both kinds of collectors, you know.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.299
I mean, when I'm at Qualich, I'm at the top end of the scale.

27:43.599 --> 27:48.384
Yeah, but we also... As you understand, I'm covering the waterfront, you know, on this.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.507
But you see, I mean, even most of us collect, you know.

27:51.527 --> 27:58.455
I consider myself quite a serious director, but I'm not on these guys who are

27:59.060 --> 28:01.263
I collect books and various things.

28:01.664 --> 28:12.037
I mean, people you've never heard of, I hope, like John Payne, Collier, and the world's greatest.

28:12.058 --> 28:12.558
Oh, I like him.

28:12.578 --> 28:15.402
He's a very fascinating character.

28:15.702 --> 28:19.628
I got interested in him when I was a graduate student, even earlier.

28:20.589 --> 28:25.836
And I should have written his biography, but I didn't.

28:25.956 --> 28:28.780
I waited for a bad man to come out and established it was there.

28:28.861 --> 28:31.504
When did that come out?

28:31.524 --> 28:32.385
Oh, it's a dreadful book.

28:32.545 --> 28:37.030
It came out about five years ago.

28:37.050 --> 28:42.356
Unfortunately, it's a biography which took as its thesis the idea that Cotier was not a forger.

28:42.376 --> 28:46.721
He was innocent of everything, and that this was conspiracy of the... What?

28:46.741 --> 28:49.183
It's rather mad.

28:49.484 --> 28:56.151
But the guy selected... The author... Yeah, well, the author... Unfortunately, the author was very selective about what he chose to tell anyone.

28:56.536 --> 28:58.659
And his book actually is quite responsive.

28:58.719 --> 29:00.882
We don't know any of the other guys.

29:00.902 --> 29:01.342
So he did this.

29:01.362 --> 29:02.223
Do you collect wise?

29:02.243 --> 29:04.106
I don't collect wise.

29:04.306 --> 29:07.570
I have a fair amount of materials related to wise.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.633
Are you interested in forgeries?

29:09.653 --> 29:09.833
Yeah.

29:10.554 --> 29:10.894
Why?

29:12.496 --> 29:14.819
What's it interesting?

29:14.839 --> 29:19.405
I think forgeries are particularly

29:20.212 --> 29:24.796
in right now in a way that is, I think, fairly lazy.

29:24.856 --> 29:33.224
Forgery, first of all, is a fascinating field, because the borderline between forgery and fiction is not an extremely clear one.

29:33.945 --> 29:38.690
Is Robinson Crusoe forgery, for example, starts by saying, this is a true story.

29:40.491 --> 29:48.379
We like that, and I think there is a certain little tickle to forgeries, which we like brushing with.

29:48.595 --> 29:57.967
lawlessness, and a lot of crushing with cheating, and there's something rather delightful about people getting away with certain things.

29:57.987 --> 30:16.932
But many foragers also play a terrible... I collect bibliography and materials throughout the history of book collecting, that's what you're doing, but I collect only... Well, you should come and see mine.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.923
No, I lived here.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.886
I lived here for 20 years.

30:24.206 --> 30:25.707
No, 15.

30:25.727 --> 30:27.689
This is home.

30:27.729 --> 30:32.593
What brought you here?

30:33.113 --> 30:39.018
Well, I was tired of teaching.

30:39.038 --> 30:44.122
Book-selling is really the only other thing I can do that makes a living.

30:44.142 --> 30:47.205
I taught at Boston University from 65 to 75.

30:47.540 --> 30:51.145
And the part that continues before that, very much.

30:51.286 --> 30:57.675
But when I quit teaching, I wanted to deal in books, and this is, I've always liked one.

30:58.376 --> 30:59.498
What did you teach?

30:59.518 --> 31:02.022
Basically, Shakespeare from Shakespeare.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.704
Shakespeare was my passion.

31:03.804 --> 31:07.190
Do you know what Michael Davis' nickname was?

31:07.210 --> 31:09.653
He was a crackhead in the crowd.

31:09.673 --> 31:11.296
False staff.

31:11.316 --> 31:11.897
I've heard that.

31:11.917 --> 31:12.678
Well, I've heard that.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.861
He was false staff.

31:14.881 --> 31:16.163
He was a private creature.

31:17.257 --> 31:19.720
I'm sorry, I don't know.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.201
I've done my work, as you can see.

31:24.725 --> 31:27.709
You're from Massachusetts, I think I asked, from where Boston came from?

31:27.729 --> 31:28.229
No, I came back.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.732
And went to Harvard, I gather.

31:30.752 --> 31:35.417
Yeah, I saw it with undergraduate and junior fellow undergraduate.

31:35.437 --> 31:42.505
And I saw the announcement for your book and the book collector, which I just recently have put together an entire one

31:43.008 --> 31:48.555
I told Nicholas last night, I said, I hope you realize how expensive these things act as a run.

31:48.735 --> 31:53.120
But I don't think I can do this project without it.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.001
They're just wonderful.

31:54.021 --> 31:55.483
I've got all the colophones.

31:55.503 --> 31:57.326
I've got all the colophones together.

31:57.346 --> 31:59.849
I've got a wonderful mint.

31:59.869 --> 32:00.690
I've never used that word.

32:00.710 --> 32:05.876
It's just an excellent copy of the Carter Pollock for your career.

32:05.896 --> 32:08.339
I have Carter's copy.

32:08.359 --> 32:09.741
You have Carter's copy?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.803
That's nice.

32:11.823 --> 32:12.424
That's nice.

32:12.742 --> 32:24.252
I'm coming back in August, September for the second round.

32:24.873 --> 32:28.576
I told Nicholas last night, I said, this is, I told my wife.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.938
I think I might have said Mary Uncle.

32:30.958 --> 32:33.640
She's wonderful.

32:33.661 --> 32:41.027
I just was thinking of the other day, in terms of singleness of purpose and length of

32:41.429 --> 32:45.375
I would probably give her my vote.

32:46.117 --> 32:51.966
No, there are some Italian and Spanish and a couple of German collectors who are really major.

32:53.068 --> 33:00.480
There are major, of course, Japanese individual collectors as well as institutional.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.206
A couple of Australian collectors that belong in your pantheon.

33:04.226 --> 33:08.112
The difficulty for me is that if I knew somebody would welcome me,

33:08.733 --> 33:13.498
I'd put you in touch, but I'd have to find out about it first.

33:14.078 --> 33:15.960
I might be able to give you something.

33:15.980 --> 33:17.021
I'm going to write you, okay?

33:17.161 --> 33:18.162
Okay.

33:18.303 --> 33:19.564
I'll look into it.

33:19.704 --> 33:27.892
I'll say the one collection which I think, above all, it's possible for you to know about it.

33:27.912 --> 33:31.816
You ought to find out about it.

33:31.836 --> 33:33.638
I'll see.

33:33.658 --> 33:35.680
Is it British?

33:35.700 --> 33:37.422
It's European.

33:37.442 --> 33:37.542
Okay.

33:38.298 --> 33:47.827
We're at the mag's reception now, and this gentleman is going to talk to me.

33:47.847 --> 33:48.267
Thank you.

33:48.287 --> 33:52.772
But we are talking now with Mr. Julian Roberts at the Bodleian.

33:53.673 --> 33:54.994
Is it the Bodley Library?

33:55.114 --> 33:55.735
Bodleian.

33:55.855 --> 33:57.516
Bodleian.

33:57.716 --> 33:58.437
Yeah.

33:58.697 --> 34:04.022
It's very familiarly as Bodleian, and then the graduates call it the Bodleian.

34:05.524 --> 34:07.866
You said you were about to vote there.

34:08.420 --> 34:11.784
an exhibit of a private collection.

34:11.884 --> 34:16.289
The current exhibition we're doing at the moment is the collection of Robert Thurston.

34:16.409 --> 34:20.513
Is that something I can see before I... You can see the exhibition, yes.

34:22.155 --> 34:25.739
Oxford, of course, has been collecting books as long as he's been in Oxford.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.921
That's right.

34:28.061 --> 34:34.208
Unfortunately, we had a medieval library, but it disappeared in the 1550s.

34:34.964 --> 34:40.953
The number of private collectors contributed to that, but at last, nearly everything was gone.

34:41.133 --> 34:45.179
My study will start effectively with the dissolution of the monasteries.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.424
Well, we did.

34:48.644 --> 35:02.845
Although there was no university library here, when the monastic books were appearing on the market or were being disposed of,

35:03.466 --> 35:09.735
Some gynecologists, of course, couldn't have quite a lot of asty books.

35:09.755 --> 35:13.641
But there was no effective university library here to receive them, as there was.

35:13.661 --> 35:21.112
For example, when the monasteries were dissolved in Leipzig in Germany, the monastic books flowed straight into the university library.

35:21.132 --> 35:21.933
That didn't happen to them.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.277
When, since there was the Web Street?

35:24.297 --> 35:26.300
Well, it was at the same time.

35:26.320 --> 35:31.768
The German monasteries were at Leipzig, the Protestant center, and there was of course

35:32.086 --> 35:35.249
where most of the monastic life is closed down.

35:35.269 --> 35:37.251
That's worth pointing out.

35:37.391 --> 35:40.353
This was by no means a unique occurrence at that time.

35:41.074 --> 35:42.095
Tragic as it was.

35:42.175 --> 35:43.876
Catastrophic.

35:44.297 --> 35:45.518
Was it catastrophic?

35:45.938 --> 35:49.982
Do you really believe that a lot of precious things were irrevocable?

35:50.002 --> 35:51.923
There's no doubt about that before.

35:53.745 --> 36:01.772
A lot of books were saved on the monastic life, but probably until about 75 to 80% of Spanish

36:04.385 --> 36:07.070
But that, of course, is true of any library of the time.

36:07.110 --> 36:13.944
Not just monastic libraries, in fact, anybody's library.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.331
You won't find that it was dispersed in

36:18.543 --> 36:28.033
In the 16th and 17th century, monastical wires were found as a rule more than an identifiable survivor rate of more than 10 or 20 percent.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.795
Of course, in these cases there was systematic destruction.

36:31.676 --> 36:35.420
It was not so much systematic, it was carelessness.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.603
People had no value for the books.

36:38.643 --> 36:45.310
They didn't realise... Well, a lot of the monks, of course, took books away from the monks.

36:46.268 --> 36:49.492
But there was also destruction of books.

36:49.512 --> 36:54.378
Didn't a number of items find their way back to the continent?

36:54.418 --> 36:57.282
Yes, not as many as you think.

36:57.362 --> 37:09.457
I suspect that either the numbers going to the continent have been exaggerated or that they've simply not been identified in continental libraries as English monastic books.

37:09.717 --> 37:12.560
I will start, this will be basically my second chapter.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.723
My first chapter is kind of an overview.

37:15.175 --> 37:29.814
starting at the Alexandria Library, and then the competition they had with programming and recalling Caesar's visit there, and just kind of an overview.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.798
But what the stakes are, I guess I really want to make clear.

37:32.858 --> 37:35.541
It's paper.

37:35.561 --> 37:37.504
When you come right down, it's paper and it's vellum.

37:37.624 --> 37:39.326
But what's on it is precious.

37:39.406 --> 37:43.892
And why do people become obsessed with saving these things?

37:43.912 --> 37:44.473
It's not just the paper.

37:45.112 --> 37:47.094
obviously, yes, contained therein.

37:47.575 --> 37:57.306
Well, Robert Burton is a very good example of a man who preserved what were thought of in his time as a female literature.

37:57.427 --> 37:58.728
And peeps to a degree.

37:58.748 --> 37:59.890
Oh, peeps, yes.

38:00.050 --> 38:03.173
Each of them preserved a female literature.

38:03.193 --> 38:08.680
And of course, the greatest collector of a female literature is Narcissus Luxor.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.064
I don't know him.

38:12.719 --> 38:14.441
How do we spell his name?

38:14.561 --> 38:16.803
Narcissus, as in Narcissus.

38:17.243 --> 38:22.088
And Luttrell, L-U-T-T-R-E-L-L.

38:22.348 --> 38:30.056
Tell me a little bit about him, if you might.

38:30.076 --> 38:30.436
Certainly.

38:31.317 --> 38:33.459
Can you tell me a little bit about Narcissus?

38:33.539 --> 38:41.427
Yes, he was... he flourished in the late 17th century and he collected

38:41.930 --> 39:08.460
You see this runs counter to a commonly held view of many circles there.

39:09.250 --> 39:23.010
the collecting of what we call modern forests developed a century, which is absolutely... No, I don't think that's... Well, the works of living writers... Living writers?

39:23.030 --> 39:30.942
I would suspect that Narcissus, if he was preserving things, cut off the press, as it were.

39:31.002 --> 39:34.026
He put the press in the ditch when he pardoned.

39:34.748 --> 39:47.967
And of course there was George Thomas, the one who got collections among the British Library, who collected all the pamphlets of the Civil War period.

39:47.987 --> 39:51.191
And you wouldn't have these things if it weren't for these people, would you say?

39:51.211 --> 39:58.582
No, at the top end of the scale he collected a lot of Milton's prose pamphlets and so on.

39:59.283 --> 40:04.570
And at the other end of the scale he collected very

40:04.752 --> 40:08.156
Very attemoral material indeed.

40:08.437 --> 40:09.418
Are there any statements?

40:09.658 --> 40:15.466
Did he state why he was doing this?

40:15.486 --> 40:21.254
Are there any records of things that he rather said?

40:21.274 --> 40:27.222
Are there any contemporary... I don't think Tom Slecht has stated.

40:27.242 --> 40:31.027
It's clear from his practice what he's trying to do.

40:31.047 --> 40:34.371
But I don't think there's a statement on everyone, but I don't think there's anything

40:34.925 --> 40:40.892
specific statement, which he said, I am trying to preserve all literature on both sides.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.874
It was issued during the Civil War.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.076
It's wonderful.

40:44.096 --> 40:45.838
And that's what he could more succeed in doing.

40:46.238 --> 40:50.423
And at what point did it come into the public domain?

40:50.624 --> 40:54.388
Well, it was bought for the New British Museum.

40:54.909 --> 41:00.115
I think the King bought it for the New British Museum in the late 18th century.

41:00.135 --> 41:02.337
So the value of this was recognized?

41:02.498 --> 41:02.758
Oh, yes.

41:02.778 --> 41:04.560
It was recognized, as long as it was.

41:05.232 --> 41:12.586
That's very important, because a lot of these collectors in the United States went to see the things that Isaiah Thomas collected.

41:13.507 --> 41:16.072
Well, not so, of course, as was another.

41:16.172 --> 41:27.814
Plus, we did see the value of the material coming off the press, picking it up as it appeared, and Thomas was another.

41:32.738 --> 41:57.835
national addiction and national biography which i would have access to at home yeah that's that's important if marcus hasn't got the set you tell him that it's still a very different work i'm in the widening library three years a week so it's only it's only half an hour at my house that's excellent what you're telling me is basically

41:58.321 --> 41:59.222
what I'm interested in.

41:59.402 --> 42:05.728
So you would say without question that the individual collective has really contributed to the preservation of the national heritage.

42:05.748 --> 42:07.790
Yes, absolutely.

42:08.511 --> 42:10.933
It was left to the academics, wouldn't it?

42:11.053 --> 42:15.738
They would only collect what they are currently interested in individually.

42:16.759 --> 42:19.021
They're interested in what they're teaching.

42:20.302 --> 42:21.163
That's funny.

42:21.183 --> 42:21.703
I love that.

42:21.723 --> 42:24.666
That's probably good.

42:26.114 --> 42:38.630
I think one thing also that you get when you see the individual collection is quirks, eccentricities, which express themselves in their collecting case.

42:42.075 --> 42:50.265
Back when we had some collections on witchcraft, it's doubtful the university would set about on a program of

42:50.650 --> 42:51.871
producing a collection.

42:51.891 --> 42:56.596
It's very unlikely that Oxford University would have collected books on witchcraft in the early 17th century.

42:56.616 --> 42:57.577
Very unlikely indeed.

42:57.957 --> 42:59.319
But do you have a collection?

42:59.639 --> 43:07.467
We don't have a specific collection on witchcraft, but we've got all the books now because people retrospectively went back before.

43:07.887 --> 43:09.209
People acquired them.

43:10.590 --> 43:12.432
So could you make a general statement?

43:12.993 --> 43:18.238
Does the university owe any kind of debt of gratitude to the individual collected?

43:18.678 --> 43:20.320
Does it owe a debt?

43:20.452 --> 43:26.881
Yes, and continuously.

43:28.523 --> 43:37.536
This very year we've been given some books by examples.

43:37.796 --> 43:47.910
A few weeks ago we went to the home of a former academic in this university, John Buxton.

43:50.793 --> 43:56.465
who was interested particularly in the greater Stephen Farris, Spencer in Sydney.

44:00.955 --> 44:05.024
And he left us the choice of his books.

44:06.467 --> 44:08.291
Who got those?

44:08.311 --> 44:08.852
That's one.

44:10.756 --> 44:11.798
It's all right.

44:11.878 --> 44:14.381
I just wonder why it's playing late.

44:14.562 --> 44:17.846
Well, that's because it's recording you.

44:17.866 --> 44:19.008
It's all right.

44:19.168 --> 44:21.592
I've got one of these things too.

44:21.892 --> 44:28.361
It proves to me that we're... It reassures me that we're dying.

44:28.402 --> 44:30.825
I've got one of these.

44:31.045 --> 44:32.087
That's beautiful.

44:32.127 --> 44:32.728
That's small.

44:32.928 --> 44:34.410
Anyway.

44:36.313 --> 44:38.576
John Buxton.

44:39.057 --> 44:39.818
John Buxton.

44:40.523 --> 44:56.499
I think even more recently we were given a collection of children's books which were connected with the family of Elizabeth Barrett Brownie, some of which had belonged to her.

44:56.519 --> 44:59.623
Again, a private collection.

44:59.883 --> 45:09.653
For me, the gems of that collection were some of the earliest separate printings of Lancaster's from Shakespeare, which I was very, very aware indeed.

45:10.088 --> 45:12.612
And these came from a private collection.

45:14.354 --> 45:21.544
One wonders if there was any kind of a temptation on the part of these people to consign and say, the Sotheby's are Christie's.

45:22.405 --> 45:27.312
They're thoughtful enough to give them to Oxford.

45:27.412 --> 45:32.920
But we must go into this where people have the opportunity, I guess.

45:34.062 --> 45:38.408
I think that items like that would come out with pretty

45:39.451 --> 45:50.442
Well, we've got a great loyalty of course among our own members of the university here.

45:50.642 --> 45:55.907
John Buxford who taught English at New College down the road.

45:55.947 --> 46:03.635
Other people see Oxford University's main library as a very fitting place for that.

46:03.655 --> 46:05.577
We've got a long history of preserving that.

46:07.278 --> 46:12.486
The record speaks for itself, a number of centuries.

46:12.506 --> 46:14.669
Yes, it does.

46:14.850 --> 46:29.292
Another thing, of course, if you adopt a very high profile in collected books, the characteristic example of course is the over-collection of these children's books.

46:29.312 --> 46:34.500
People offer you more books because you are known to have a great collection.

46:35.257 --> 47:03.120
uh this is one way also to perpetuate the name of the collective yes well we do do that actually those books will be given themselves forever that that was a case where was it wasn't there a national drive and didn't the prince actually help because i think these these books actually were

47:03.843 --> 47:07.167
kind of on their way to the Archeneur's plot, weren't they?

47:07.188 --> 47:09.010
No, not the Earthquake, no.

47:09.030 --> 47:10.272
Well, maybe the artifacts were.

47:10.292 --> 47:14.698
The Earthquakes had always wanted them to come, you know, because they did so much of their early research.

47:15.098 --> 47:17.562
But he died unexpectedly, I think, didn't he?

47:17.622 --> 47:20.285
He was in pain in health, I think, wasn't he?

47:20.345 --> 47:24.150
And she is still very lively and weak.

47:24.170 --> 47:27.195
So they found a proper home here, thank goodness?

47:27.535 --> 47:28.276
Yes.

47:28.296 --> 47:31.020
I think, yes, yes.

47:31.661 --> 47:32.702
How would you feel

47:35.467 --> 47:46.899
to see if you saw a collection like the Oakley collection broken up and down and go to... Well, we were thinking of a very, very pretty thing.

47:46.919 --> 47:49.502
Because the point about the A.P.

47:49.582 --> 47:54.847
collection, you see, was that, again, for me, the treasures of the A.P.

47:54.867 --> 48:02.155
collection were the trifling of the books, which our predecessors didn't think there was any interest.

48:02.215 --> 48:05.018
In the children's books of the 18th and early 19th century,

48:05.335 --> 48:09.841
which our predecessors were not interested in.

48:11.404 --> 48:21.318
And we now realise... When you say predecessors, you mean... People like, people like, holding jobs like mine, two and three hundred years ago.

48:21.338 --> 48:22.199
They were, they were.

48:22.399 --> 48:23.661
Were they in presentation?

48:23.681 --> 48:24.242
Not in general.

48:24.783 --> 48:29.790
They were not really interested in...

48:32.639 --> 48:36.504
which they would have considered as something a very slight interest.

48:36.524 --> 48:47.239
And don't forget that English literature was not taught in this university until the 19th century.

48:47.259 --> 48:48.460
Might go out, why?

48:48.480 --> 48:51.785
Well, it was, you could view, it was, it wasn't.

48:51.805 --> 48:57.833
Well, what was taught here is task force, the theology, law.

48:57.853 --> 48:59.575
No Shakespeare?

49:00.922 --> 49:02.584
Shakespeare's not taught in this university.

49:02.604 --> 49:04.267
He was collected in a library.

49:04.307 --> 49:06.490
He's not taught in a library.

49:06.510 --> 49:07.211
That's extraordinary.

49:07.671 --> 49:10.375
Well, he's taught in an American university library.

49:10.395 --> 49:11.777
Well, I understand.

49:11.997 --> 49:13.779
I'm a Shakespeare fanatic.

49:13.820 --> 49:16.103
Well, you won't find that St.

49:16.223 --> 49:17.885
Harvard was teaching Shakespeare.

49:20.288 --> 49:21.470
It's extraordinary.

49:22.031 --> 49:28.680
I'm the first collector, and the first major collector, so I think I've had a collection in the United States of Shakespeare.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.422
It's probably Boston from the library.

49:30.807 --> 49:34.512
They have a fascinating collection.

49:34.532 --> 49:47.368
Of course, the Folgers came through rather late, but there's a case of a truly obsessive collection out there.

49:47.608 --> 49:57.261
When you set about to look for, to identify collections, are you looking for collections or are you looking for items?

49:57.981 --> 50:00.004
I understand Cambridge now is

50:00.406 --> 50:02.288
really going after entire collections.

50:02.308 --> 50:04.270
That's something I really get.

50:04.290 --> 50:05.311
I haven't asked what's coming up.

50:05.451 --> 50:07.313
What did you see?

50:07.333 --> 50:08.634
John Maggs.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.435
I asked, yes.

50:09.455 --> 50:11.097
Well, Cambridge first.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.723
Yes, Cambridge is certainly buying her collections.

50:17.984 --> 50:19.706
I suggest that that's something I might look into.

50:19.846 --> 50:22.969
Not that there's any, just an interesting thing for a university doing.

50:22.989 --> 50:29.856
Well, Cambridge, like ourselves, would find, if they buy an entire collection, they don't have quite a lot of their books already.

50:30.275 --> 50:36.581
as we would with the other collection.

50:37.062 --> 50:45.590
So rather than break them up, rather than dissipate the collection, just break them together.

50:46.311 --> 50:49.314
I see no problem with duplication personally.

50:49.374 --> 50:59.404
I know that I was rather astonished to learn that the Don Quixote was sold at the Garden Sale in November, which went for 1.5 million

50:59.688 --> 51:03.792
to a Spanish, an anonymous Spanish colleague.

51:04.893 --> 51:12.862
That book, which was a perfect, I mean it was the condition, it was exquisite, actually came from the Morgan collection.

51:12.882 --> 51:14.063
It is.

51:14.083 --> 51:16.606
And there are only six of these known in existence.

51:16.846 --> 51:19.409
Well, we've had ours since the lovely first set up.

51:19.549 --> 51:21.871
Well, that's the way it came from.

51:21.891 --> 51:22.372
Our agent.

51:22.392 --> 51:24.434
Our agent bought the book.

51:24.454 --> 51:24.714
Truly.

51:25.515 --> 51:27.197
We've had it since it's published.

51:27.217 --> 51:28.298
Well, that's wonderful.

51:28.318 --> 51:29.239
That's the way it came from.

51:29.472 --> 51:35.017
Well, Marcus, of course, tells a wonderful story because, of course, it doesn't involve him.

51:35.438 --> 51:39.482
You know, they could have had the Audubon Elephant Folio.

51:39.502 --> 51:48.451
Audubon came through Worcester, spent two days trying to get an appointment with the dental librarian to sell, and they didn't have time to see him.

51:48.731 --> 51:52.375
Well, you've always got time to see people.

51:52.655 --> 51:54.777
And Marcus said, well, I can't do this.

51:54.797 --> 51:57.960
Marcus will tell you, I'll tell you the same.

51:58.497 --> 52:06.788
Nineteen times out of twenty, you know, we get nowhere, but twenty is the one.

52:06.888 --> 52:20.485
It was a Saturday morning, I was on duty here, and somebody came, a gentleman came to say, what was there anybody to talk to about collecting maps?

52:20.625 --> 52:26.513
And I said, okay, I'll see him, the lab is shutting him up now, I don't have a way to go.

52:27.522 --> 52:37.116
He turned out that he got the disposal of the finest collection of maps and private accounts.

52:37.136 --> 52:37.857
And he got them now.

52:38.538 --> 52:39.319
This was a deal?

52:39.699 --> 52:43.965
No, he was the brother of the collector.

52:43.985 --> 52:50.895
He did more or less have the disposal of this collection.

52:50.915 --> 52:56.483
Because we were nice to him, in the end we got the collection.

52:57.087 --> 53:00.411
I'm curious that he came to a university first and I'll do a dealer.

53:01.232 --> 53:11.566
Well, he wanted to keep a collection together, so what a dealer can't do is to pay in general, unless he's got somebody who wants to buy a collection, in general he can't guarantee to keep them together.

53:11.586 --> 53:17.394
This man wanted to keep them and have them kept together as a memorial for his legacy project.

53:17.474 --> 53:21.920
Can you think of that thing in the name of the collection?

53:21.980 --> 53:23.662
That's an interesting story.

53:23.682 --> 53:24.563
The collection is called the

53:25.285 --> 53:28.709
And this is just a recent, is it?

53:29.630 --> 53:31.632
And so it's here now?

53:31.712 --> 53:34.715
And you call it a major collection?

53:34.795 --> 53:38.599
It is a major collection, yes.

53:38.700 --> 53:39.841
I love maps.

53:41.102 --> 53:43.505
Maps just transport me.

53:45.647 --> 53:48.851
So you are strong here in cartography.

53:48.871 --> 53:52.394
Yes, that is one of our best friends, historical cartography.

53:52.755 --> 53:54.837
Do you have a specific focus?

53:55.238 --> 53:59.885
or are you really quite willing to go after anything that's significant?

53:59.905 --> 54:12.083
Well, we try... If you ask what the purpose of the Buckingham Library is, the first answer is to support the research and teaching at Oxford University.

54:12.143 --> 54:15.969
Which would suggest that you should follow the curriculum, wouldn't it?

54:15.989 --> 54:19.795
Yes, but you've got to keep an eye on the curriculum of the future as well.

54:20.264 --> 54:26.750
We are now, you see, a center for research into literature for children, which we were never before.

54:28.031 --> 54:34.897
So the Oakley collection will bring people doing research into the University of Oxford.

54:34.917 --> 54:37.039
It's wonderful.

54:37.199 --> 54:37.860
Continue with that.

54:37.900 --> 54:43.825
I interrupted what you said, if I were to ask for the purpose.

54:44.025 --> 54:45.366
Well, that's the principle.

54:45.386 --> 54:49.630
The second purpose is to act as an international library for research.

54:49.812 --> 54:52.335
a very large number, a portion of them are.

54:52.355 --> 54:54.256
We just come from that side of us.

54:56.419 --> 54:58.180
This is all the Bodleian right here.

54:58.441 --> 54:58.681
Yes.

54:58.861 --> 54:59.882
In this area.

54:59.902 --> 55:05.728
What you're in now is a new volcano, which was built in the 30s and opened just after the war.

55:06.108 --> 55:07.470
And there's an old Bodleian?

55:07.550 --> 55:08.391
An old Bodleian, yes.

55:08.451 --> 55:09.812
Where you sort of shop.

55:09.852 --> 55:10.693
That's it, the old Bodleian.

55:11.253 --> 55:14.577
Oh, so the library separated by the street?

55:14.837 --> 55:15.237
Yes.

55:17.520 --> 55:19.802
You can walk on the ground to the other side.

55:20.035 --> 55:22.318
Will I be able to see a few things while I'm allowed?

55:22.338 --> 55:24.842
Well, I can take you over there, yes.

55:24.862 --> 55:25.603
That would be wonderful.

55:25.623 --> 55:26.785
That would be wonderful.

55:26.885 --> 55:33.414
Is there kind of a friendly competition between Oxford and Cambridge for the acquisition of what's going on?

55:34.496 --> 55:34.676
Yes.

55:34.696 --> 55:36.478
Do you collect basically the same things?

55:36.539 --> 55:41.526
We have the same sort of materials, yes.

55:41.546 --> 55:43.448
I'm trying to get into this delicately.

55:45.211 --> 55:48.135
Would you say it's a healthy competition?

55:48.436 --> 56:07.237
Do you ever find yourselves in the position of bidding against each other?

56:07.257 --> 56:12.723
We wouldn't normally bid commercially against them.

56:14.845 --> 56:17.548
I don't think we've ever been in that position.

56:17.782 --> 56:27.796
If a major item came up in Yorkshire, we should.

56:27.836 --> 56:34.144
Nicholas Barker was telling me the other night about a very interesting story, which I hadn't heard about, and I had to check it.

56:34.164 --> 56:36.988
Oh, gee, put this tape on the other side before we went out.
