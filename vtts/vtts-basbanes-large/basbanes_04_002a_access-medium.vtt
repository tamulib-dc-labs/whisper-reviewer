WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:03.121
There we go.

00:03.141 --> 00:04.984
Okay, we're talking to Nick Baker.

00:06.446 --> 00:07.528
Fascinating stuff.

00:07.548 --> 00:08.569
Thank you very, very much.

00:08.650 --> 00:11.134
I was absorbed in it last night.

00:12.656 --> 00:24.435
This talk, weeds, it's not exactly, I mean, you mentioned in this preface here that a lot of it was used, or some of it was used in the

00:24.922 --> 00:26.704
New Yorker essay that you did.

00:27.505 --> 00:30.648
But really, I think it's a totally separate thing, entirely.

00:31.709 --> 00:47.285
Well, it was meant to be read aloud, and it was, by the time I was, by the time the New Yorker got around to doing the editing, I put together a different version, and then that went through metamorphosis and stuff.

00:47.565 --> 00:49.667
It did end up being different.

00:49.687 --> 00:52.330
But I wanted to alert people that it was,

00:52.968 --> 00:58.394
that there was some overlap, a couple of the passages in the middle of the thing.

00:59.075 --> 01:04.521
You mentioned a few, to my mind, minor factual errors.

01:04.861 --> 01:07.104
Why didn't you just correct them, just out of curiosity?

01:07.404 --> 01:22.401
Well, it got so... The opposition from the library's publicity department got so nasty at some point that they posted on the web

01:23.157 --> 01:47.079
this listing of all the errors in my New Yorker piece, but it was really a false list because they would pounce on things that the fact checker asked someone and then say, see, he doesn't know, and things like that.

01:47.179 --> 01:48.321
When the fact checker

01:48.875 --> 01:53.220
was simply trying to find out from them what the figures were.

01:53.260 --> 01:58.546
So they were pouncing on tiny errors that weren't material.

01:59.367 --> 02:05.994
And therefore, I felt that I had to have the original talk exactly as I said it.

02:06.414 --> 02:12.862
So there wouldn't be any charge that, oh, well, he's shifted his position or something.

02:15.064 --> 02:18.628
And then include any little corrections in the beginning.

02:19.435 --> 02:39.842
So it was just sort of part of this whole thing that really, really the reaction on the part of the administration, particularly this guy.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.004
Dale Carlson?

02:41.164 --> 02:41.965
Publicity person.

02:42.045 --> 02:49.375
No, he was bad, but he wasn't the one who kind of, he got mad, you know, so he wrote those angry letters.

02:49.912 --> 03:01.005
but the one who really engaged in sustained effort and character of that nation was the woman, Marsha Schneider.

03:01.025 --> 03:01.946
Marsha Schneider.

03:03.568 --> 03:07.974
She, I think... I think I met her briefly.

03:07.994 --> 03:17.225
Her job is still to be the media, whatever they call it, essentially the corporate communication.

03:17.405 --> 03:17.505
Yeah.

03:17.603 --> 03:23.038
It's sort of funny that a public library would have this.

03:23.058 --> 03:32.102
Well, when I went there last September, and really I was out in San Francisco for other things and tried to put this thing together.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.173
I asked to see Dowlin.

03:34.474 --> 03:37.618
It was amazing the buffers that were put between him.

03:37.638 --> 03:38.700
I never saw him.

03:40.603 --> 03:46.932
She put me on a little potted plant tour of the library.

03:47.052 --> 03:52.200
I doubt she took you to see one quarter of the library actually.

03:52.602 --> 03:53.944
That's amazing.

03:54.465 --> 04:00.735
As I'm going through all this stuff last night, I'm writing up a few narrative strategies here.

04:00.855 --> 04:02.418
Boy, it's quite a story.

04:02.859 --> 04:03.420
It really is.

04:05.122 --> 04:09.169
Would you consider yourself number one?

04:09.189 --> 04:15.960
Would you accept the characterization of yourself as a library activist in this particular instance?

04:19.619 --> 04:25.527
Well, I became... I never liked those noun pairs.

04:25.767 --> 04:26.468
Okay.

04:27.029 --> 04:29.272
But yes, I became certain.

04:29.532 --> 04:33.157
I, by the end, was calling myself one, I think.

04:33.878 --> 04:34.719
Is that right?

04:34.739 --> 04:36.682
Because it was so troubling.

04:36.822 --> 04:47.837
Really, the moment it decided it for me was going to a Library Commission meeting and seeing the head of the Library Commission, whose name is Stephen Coulter,

04:48.138 --> 04:57.992
be so rude to people who were obviously literate, intelligent people who were coming up and saying, maybe this isn't a good idea.

04:58.012 --> 04:59.213
He was so nasty.

04:59.233 --> 05:10.509
And there was a level of arrogance there that I associate with, I don't know, the nuclear power industry or something.

05:10.949 --> 05:17.318
And I just was staggered to see this kind of thing going on at a great

05:17.500 --> 05:34.662
public library, and I thought that, and then I had all these, I had this site still in my head of Brooks Hall and the estimates of the number of books and pictures and all that stuff.

05:36.604 --> 05:40.209
So I kind of had to become a library activist.

05:41.230 --> 05:46.377
The other problem was that I said these things, but I only said them in a speech.

05:46.762 --> 05:51.726
And then it took a long time for the New Yorker to publish the written version.

05:52.707 --> 06:07.680
So the only way that I could give people something to think about if a reporter called or something was to do an interview.

06:07.740 --> 06:15.807
So I ended up making all the charges that I had planned to make from the written New Yorker piece.

06:16.090 --> 06:27.023
to reporters ahead of time, which, of course, gave the library administration this wonderful opportunity to prepare their dossier of objections.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.728
Now, who's in charge there now?

06:31.928 --> 06:33.550
This woman, Kathy, is she still there?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.293
Kathy Page is in charge, yeah.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.536
Is she interim or has she got the job?

06:38.556 --> 06:39.096
She's interim.

06:39.116 --> 06:45.844
They've got a search committee going, and I don't know if they've made any progress with that, but she's...

06:46.853 --> 06:47.654
She's in charge.

06:48.855 --> 06:51.358
Now, the letter you sent to the mayor, did he respond?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.461
Did you get an answer to that?

06:53.761 --> 06:54.782
He never responded, no.

06:55.203 --> 07:04.173
But then it was funny because there was a piece in the Chronicle in which the mayor suddenly said, you know what I think they should do with the libraries?

07:04.193 --> 07:09.199
I think they should take over the old Maine and then you're going to have to use the new Maine and the old Maine.

07:09.905 --> 07:34.630
together and that and uh the article came out oh well that's interesting i guess he did read the letter or something it's not an idea that only i have put forward but i don't know if anyone has written a mayor like that before with with that idea but uh then then there was such a fuss from the asian art museum that he now says he now came up with this other idea that the old

07:35.150 --> 07:38.878
The library should take over the old Mint, which is a building far away.

07:38.898 --> 07:40.361
Yeah, I know that building.

07:40.381 --> 07:41.022
Wouldn't work very well.

07:41.042 --> 07:41.704
That wouldn't work.

07:41.784 --> 07:49.320
But no, and you point out, as you point out in that letter, it's by no means a unique proposal.

07:50.001 --> 07:52.928
They did something similar in Boston, Philadelphia.

07:52.948 --> 07:55.032
The new French library.

07:55.012 --> 08:06.506
which cost something like 7 billion francs to build, they are still keeping the Richelieu Library downtown, the old Bibliotheque Nationale, where they're going to keep manuscripts and stuff.

08:06.546 --> 08:10.390
So, I mean, it's a very workable thing there.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.373
It would be the right thing.

08:12.393 --> 08:19.001
It's a building that right now has all the stacks are there, and it's got all the mottos all over the facade.

08:19.341 --> 08:19.862
It's nice.

08:20.623 --> 08:24.327
It's a library, and it could be...

08:24.982 --> 08:31.910
go back to that function instantly, and the problems of storage would be solved.

08:31.930 --> 08:32.571
But it didn't work.

08:33.632 --> 08:34.292
What's your sense?

08:34.312 --> 08:51.732
Is this something that's aberrational to San Francisco, or do you think that that far more sinister situation is that this is endemic to what's going on in libraries throughout the country, what you perceived happening there in San Francisco?

08:52.589 --> 09:09.587
I know best what's going on in San Francisco, and I don't... I keep getting letters from people saying, believe me, you know, it's the same thing happened in my library at X, and so I assume that similar things.

09:09.627 --> 09:20.318
But I do think that the San Francisco case was unusual in that a man who was such an apostle of

09:20.686 --> 09:24.871
digitalism or something was put in charge.

09:24.971 --> 09:25.852
I like that word.

09:28.815 --> 09:36.724
It did such harm to the older components of the collection.

09:36.945 --> 09:50.440
I just think it's an unusually clear example of the kinds of incompetence that you can get if your board is run by

09:50.858 --> 10:02.458
somebody who's in the connectivity business, like Coulter, whose job is to further the aims and wishes and dreams of Pacific Bell.

10:03.479 --> 10:04.641
That's their method.

10:04.822 --> 10:14.638
And I think it's the method of lots of these kind of newer entrepreneurial phone systems is to give a big gift in which you

10:15.192 --> 10:18.136
set up a digital information center.

10:18.436 --> 10:22.101
You know, there's one going in the library here at Cal.

10:22.121 --> 10:37.903
And then once you give the gift in the one year of the leased lines, then you know that for the next forever you're going to get those leased line fees will come in, and they're not cheap.

10:37.963 --> 10:44.912
So it's a real business decision that you get people set up, and it's just like...

10:46.192 --> 10:49.637
It's like the mug of the month club.

10:49.897 --> 11:05.519
Look at the gift, the $250 million Bill Gates gift to libraries, tied in with another $250 million or $200 million of Microsoft software.

11:05.639 --> 11:10.086
What exactly is he doing there, I wonder?

11:10.106 --> 11:15.253
I think that people haven't yet understood...

11:15.740 --> 11:38.833
that the railroads, you know, I mean, I know that people, this is not a new analogy, but the way people are playing around with the tariffs and stuff with these leased lines and link-ups is very similar to the monopolistic practices of the railroads.

11:38.853 --> 11:41.557
But it was a guy in the New York Times who said that.

11:43.080 --> 11:43.721
Anyway.

11:43.961 --> 11:45.443
But yes, I...

11:46.368 --> 11:48.190
Paul LeClaire wrote a piece for it.

11:48.230 --> 11:54.596
Yeah, maybe somebody did that, but there was the guy who wrote, he was a science writer.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.740
Wilfred Bride, one of those others.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.424
Do you mind indulging me just a little bit?

12:04.485 --> 12:05.426
How were you drawn to this?

12:05.647 --> 12:10.752
Did it start with the card catalogs thing, story?

12:10.992 --> 12:15.396
It did, because I had several card catalogs that I

12:16.186 --> 12:21.414
genuinely, you know, odd as it may sound, loved.

12:21.855 --> 12:45.450
And the fact that they were being thrown out upset me because I felt that there was intellectual content there that was being lost, a way of ordering the world of knowledge that was not being

12:46.358 --> 12:52.784
offered by the online system that was replacing them.

12:56.908 --> 13:13.024
So then I got, you know, I was calling all these libraries all over the country asking what was happening and was getting the same kind of story everywhere that

13:14.843 --> 13:19.650
It was kind of a gleeful, happy feeling that they were going.

13:20.230 --> 13:26.279
And then a few people who were upset about it, and so I thought I should write about it.

13:26.639 --> 13:33.148
It also seemed to me to stand for a general kind of contempt for history.

13:34.050 --> 13:44.344
I mean, if you cannot trust the library to recognize the value of its own historical artifacts, then

13:44.797 --> 14:00.256
perhaps we should be suspicious of the library's ability to recognize the larger historical value of old books and old documents in general.

14:01.898 --> 14:11.850
So it seemed to be a tight... It stood for a larger problem, which is that librarians... That is to say library administrators have...

14:13.636 --> 14:17.240
have become contemptuous of the past in many cases.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.043
But it also was something that just upset me terribly.

14:22.104 --> 14:30.393
And so then the natural progression from that to getting to the library story, the actual story.

14:30.413 --> 14:31.394
I should send you this tape.

14:31.434 --> 14:36.719
What happened was, I mean, I got a lot of letters then from librarians, many of them.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.300
Following the New Yorker story.

14:38.681 --> 14:40.683
Following that card catalog story.

14:40.703 --> 14:40.943
Yeah.

14:41.497 --> 14:43.800
saying, you know, I'm glad you did this.

14:46.284 --> 14:59.543
The letters to me were overwhelmingly positive, although the reaction on the web, I guess it wasn't the web at that point, the listservs, was vicious.

14:59.603 --> 15:03.649
But following that... Who was vicious?

15:04.249 --> 15:10.238
The listservs, the old... They used to be... Before the web, there were these...

15:10.825 --> 15:12.367
I guess the web was just being started.

15:12.387 --> 15:13.468
There were listservs.

15:13.508 --> 15:14.209
They still are.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.171
They're fascinating places.

15:16.191 --> 15:21.577
But AutoCAD, have you seen AutoCAD?

15:23.379 --> 15:28.145
It's like a bulletin board, but using the Internet.

15:28.165 --> 15:33.971
And everybody who signs up automatically gets these postings.

15:33.991 --> 15:35.653
Sort of like being in an auto.

15:35.833 --> 15:39.077
And AutoCAD is the one for automated cataloging.

15:39.698 --> 15:44.905
And there's also Pub Live is one.

15:45.065 --> 16:08.558
And some of the most rabid kind of destructive modernists are in that are

16:08.757 --> 16:09.678
posting there.

16:10.039 --> 16:14.884
I mean, it really is kind of amazing sometimes.

16:15.245 --> 16:26.057
But if you just cruise around, some of the postings have been posted in other people's websites and stuff, so you might have seen them there.

16:26.117 --> 16:29.481
But I think AutoCAD.

16:29.942 --> 16:30.503
AutoCAD.

16:30.743 --> 16:31.263
I'll find it.

16:31.864 --> 16:38.612
AutoCAD, what you do is you have to send

16:39.520 --> 16:44.626
a piece of mail to the list owner who's at Cornell, I think.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.909
No, not at Cornell.

16:46.929 --> 16:47.290
Somewhere.

16:47.470 --> 16:51.435
And then you automatically get all the postings.

16:51.695 --> 16:51.955
I know.

16:52.216 --> 16:54.078
There's a similar thing for ex libris.

16:54.198 --> 16:55.079
Yeah, that's it.

16:55.099 --> 16:56.421
It's the same thing.

16:57.342 --> 16:59.324
Which I go into every once in a while.

16:59.445 --> 17:06.253
Five library ones that I remember.

17:07.752 --> 17:17.466
And so anyway, the reaction there was fierce, and there was a lot of... And then some librarians came to my defense, and it was... Who came to your defense?

17:18.427 --> 17:20.290
Can you think of any people in particular?

17:21.812 --> 17:30.405
Yeah, there was a really nice, more recently, a really great letter from somebody in Texas.

17:31.827 --> 17:36.173
I just got shipped all my stuff, so I can probably dig it out.

17:36.575 --> 17:38.438
Wait, this is HRC, you sent your stuff?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.002
I'm sorry, is that where you sent your stuff to Texas?

17:41.943 --> 17:44.547
No, my stuff was shipped back from England.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.089
Oh, I see, I'm sorry, okay.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.293
I misunderstood, okay.

17:48.313 --> 17:52.539
But I can find out, but it was really an eloquent thing.

17:53.561 --> 18:04.557
But anyway, so one of the people who got in touch with me was a librarian at San Francisco Public after I'd gone to this radio show, because the...

18:06.663 --> 18:27.065
the library was opening, there was a big fuss, and so Dowlin was on the radio show, Kessler, and who you talked to, I think, and me, and the guy, and Gray Breckin, who's the guy who also gave a talk that evening, the talk that I said, he also was there that evening.

18:27.166 --> 18:33.953
And I never knew, I didn't know him before the radio show, and I was in a hotel room somewhere, because I was on a

18:34.135 --> 18:36.840
reading tour, but I participated by phone.

18:38.102 --> 18:57.898
And Dowlin and Kessler were predictably extolling the advanced search features of the online catalog and all that, and it's just fine, although the San Francisco Public's online catalog is not a thing of beauty and has...

18:58.655 --> 19:04.921
many problems, and it doesn't even include all the actual books in the library.

19:05.081 --> 19:06.522
The conversion isn't finished, et cetera.

19:07.263 --> 19:26.281
But what was strange was that Dallin seemed to be implying, strange in retrospect, was that Dallin seemed to be implying that the library had thrown out the card catalogs already, except for some thousand that it plastered to the wall, right?

19:26.821 --> 19:28.543
Yeah, I saw them, yeah.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.261
But the librarian who called me said no.

19:33.242 --> 19:35.946
You know, that's the impression that he wants to give.

19:37.327 --> 19:41.632
But actually, the card catalog is untouched and it's still in the old building.

19:41.672 --> 19:45.997
And only, you know, you're the one who could probably save it.

19:46.858 --> 19:56.750
So then I thought, well, you know, do you really care about these things or are you just kind of a dilettante who writes magazine articles and stuff?

19:56.770 --> 19:57.130
And so...

19:58.375 --> 20:21.149
At that point, when I realized that there was this... Now I understand it's a known technique, that you imply that the thing is... It happened at Haverford, too, in a sense, although I hate to dump on this guy who's a reasonably nice guy, but he hid the card catalog away before destroying it for some months.

20:22.251 --> 20:26.998
It gave the impression that it had already been carted off to a landfill, or to a recycling.

20:27.738 --> 20:29.901
and then destroy it.

20:30.041 --> 20:33.005
So this is a known way of doing it.

20:33.405 --> 20:43.298
You make a very clean break, imply that the old thing is destroyed, and then people can't raise a fuss because what are they going to... It's a fait accompli.

20:43.599 --> 20:45.141
Right.

20:46.583 --> 20:56.175
But when I realized that they were trying to pull that, and that the old catalog was in perfect shape, and it really was... So then anyway, I got a chance to

21:01.252 --> 21:05.276
I got a chance to peek at it.

21:06.077 --> 21:06.697
The catalog?

21:07.098 --> 21:08.319
Yeah, yeah.

21:08.339 --> 21:09.400
But not to study it.

21:10.541 --> 21:30.060
And so then my only other, I felt, kind of somewhat maybe possibly deft move was to make a Public Information Act request.

21:31.188 --> 21:36.376
to see the card catalog because then it changed its status.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.159
So that's 979033, right?

21:38.379 --> 21:41.704
Is that another public information request?

21:41.785 --> 21:44.329
That's the case number, the one that you reference in these letters?

21:46.131 --> 21:46.993
Yeah, yeah.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.816
Oh, the case number.

21:48.876 --> 21:49.176
Yeah.

21:49.497 --> 21:52.041
Well, the case, it didn't actually, it wasn't a case at that point.

21:52.081 --> 21:58.731
It was just a, I mean, I didn't go to lawyers until it was repeatedly denied, but...

22:00.297 --> 22:00.858
Right.

22:01.579 --> 22:10.191
There's a law in California that's a little bit stricter version of the federal freedom of information law.

22:10.652 --> 22:25.052
And it says that you have the right to see any document that's... I can't remember how they phrased it, but in any case, the card catalog certainly sits under the rubric of a public document.

22:25.132 --> 22:26.314
They're denying it.

22:26.694 --> 22:29.258
And they're saying, no, we cannot allow this at this time.

22:29.660 --> 22:31.382
And that's illegal.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.590
What is the status of that, by the way?

22:39.292 --> 22:40.734
It's sort of in limbo.

22:40.754 --> 22:44.859
So they're still to this day denying you access to this public document?

22:45.640 --> 22:45.980
No, no.

22:48.063 --> 22:58.536
What they did was sent over drawers finally after the speech and somewhere in August, I think, or July.

22:58.988 --> 23:01.831
They sent over the drawers that I specifically requested.

23:03.493 --> 23:08.197
And to the new library, to that nice San Francisco History Center on the top.

23:09.299 --> 23:10.220
And I used them up there.

23:10.540 --> 23:13.103
So they just had a book truck full of card catalog drawers.

23:14.264 --> 23:21.131
It was kind of hilarious to have this air of great secrecy.

23:21.311 --> 23:23.433
Like the Pentagon Papers, for God's sake.

23:23.874 --> 23:26.116
Like the Pentagon Papers, you know?

23:26.136 --> 23:28.118
Yeah, and also to have it be in their...

23:28.604 --> 23:37.676
essentially their most prized possession room, the California history and rare books kind of area.

23:38.276 --> 23:53.155
And there I am looking through the thing that they wanted to, not they, but Dowlin and Coulter mostly wanted to come.

23:53.175 --> 23:56.840
But it was helpful because what I did was I did kind of a sample.

23:56.900 --> 23:57.801
I wanted to find out

23:58.456 --> 24:05.165
How many of the books of certain sample writers could I find in the online catalog?

24:05.786 --> 24:07.328
That's, by the way, terrific.

24:08.269 --> 24:11.233
I have to say that's magnificent investigative work.

24:11.873 --> 24:19.443
Well, but there are many, many problems with that because you never know whether they're in the online catalog.

24:20.224 --> 24:28.395
They're not in the online catalog because the online catalog is bad or because the book has been...

24:28.662 --> 24:29.904
thrown out or given away.

24:29.924 --> 24:31.487
Maybe it's deliberately ambiguous?

24:32.969 --> 24:35.253
Well, I think not.

24:35.273 --> 24:43.907
I don't think that... I think that Dallin really just didn't care about that because he's not interested in the old collections.

24:43.927 --> 24:55.986
And so it wasn't that he... Although, you know, you start to think... Once you get involved in these things, you do start to think a little bit more like a conspiracy theorist when...

24:56.573 --> 25:09.753
When all the news, say all the radio DJs are getting this duffing of the real truth about Nicholson Baker and it's this packet of stuff that's, you know, smear stuff.

25:10.494 --> 25:13.158
The anti-Semitic thing was bad.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.582
So you do start to think that way more.

25:15.622 --> 25:22.092
But I don't think it was, I think most of what happened was the result of

25:23.236 --> 25:41.380
the library's senior administration starving the traditional areas of librarianship, that is, cataloging and reference staff, those kinds of people, so that the library just suffered and was unable to do its job.

25:42.902 --> 25:49.311
And one of its jobs was to, you know, to convert to an online system, but there wasn't, I mean,

25:49.561 --> 25:50.603
It's more than that.

25:51.745 --> 25:55.753
He's not just converting to an online system.

25:55.934 --> 25:56.916
He's getting rid of books.

25:57.156 --> 26:01.284
He's philosophically taking off into a new direction.

26:02.146 --> 26:05.673
Printed books are quite irrelevant in his view.

26:06.014 --> 26:07.637
That's a view that he's

26:08.242 --> 26:10.324
He wrote a book in 1984.

26:10.425 --> 26:15.751
It's considered one of the seminal texts of this whole movement.

26:15.771 --> 26:16.512
Have you ever looked at it?

26:16.872 --> 26:19.035
I have a copy of it, yeah.

26:19.275 --> 26:34.553
It's really funny because you can see some of the ironies of this whole wave of enthusiasm because there's a picture on one page of the Dowland Den.

26:34.573 --> 26:36.175
He calls it the Dowland Den.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.236
It's a picture of his

26:37.807 --> 26:47.638
I can't remember his radio shack, you know, 180.

26:47.738 --> 26:53.324
I don't know the numbers, but with 256K of memory, it proudly says that kind of thing.

26:53.845 --> 27:05.278
You know, I mean, it's the equipment in the Dowland Den, in that picture, in a book from 1984, is worthless now.

27:05.298 --> 27:07.240
It really would be scrapped.

27:07.675 --> 27:12.561
unless you were putting together a museum of computers, which should happen more.

27:13.682 --> 27:28.580
But the book that Dowlin wrote in 1984, Dog Years Though It Is, is still extremely valuable because it represents a way of thinking that has great historical interest.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.565
It's part of the beginning of something that's now causing us so much trouble.

27:32.926 --> 27:34.948
So the strange thing is that

27:35.705 --> 27:51.884
These huge sums that Dowland has spent over the years, not just on his own computer equipment, but on various library systems' computer equipment, are, well, much of it is wasted because it has no lasting value.

27:51.984 --> 27:57.651
I mean, after five years, you've got to get a new set of monitors.

27:57.671 --> 28:01.776
You've got to spend another five million and re-equip your system.

28:02.557 --> 28:03.298
But the books...

28:03.785 --> 28:05.207
have residual value.

28:06.608 --> 28:09.051
I have a case of a library in St.

28:09.091 --> 28:09.912
Paul, Minnesota.

28:10.092 --> 28:18.722
I'm just getting preliminary detail on it now, but it's like a little Newbery library, you know, so it's not a public library.

28:19.824 --> 28:27.793
But they sold, through a bookseller, about $3 million worth of exquisitely rare books to buy computer equipment.

28:28.293 --> 28:29.154
Oh, yeah.

28:29.174 --> 28:30.636
Now, that's a very...

28:31.088 --> 28:32.329
short-sighted decision.

28:33.030 --> 28:35.253
And those books are gone forever now, of course.

28:35.954 --> 28:37.455
Well, at least they're sold.

28:37.495 --> 28:53.494
If you go through and sell really valuable books, there's some feeling, and you know this much better than I, because you've chronicled the progression of these books around the provenance and all.

28:53.514 --> 28:58.159
But at least we know that the rare book market understands the value of these things and stuff.

28:58.595 --> 29:02.802
Well, at least they brought in a... In fact, it made this bookseller.

29:02.902 --> 29:08.272
I mean, he's now on the board of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, a young guy.

29:08.312 --> 29:11.076
And he said, he's quite open.

29:11.096 --> 29:12.739
He said, you know, this made my career.

29:12.799 --> 29:19.911
I mean, by having these books and being able to put them on the world market, you know.

29:19.931 --> 29:20.973
I'm a different guy now.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.758
Yeah, well, yeah, he's... Yeah, well...

29:23.738 --> 29:25.300
That's very sad.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.623
It is sad because it was a... But it's not just sad.

29:28.663 --> 29:29.724
That's what I think.

29:29.744 --> 29:46.361
In the case of the least of San Francisco Public Library, it's illegal because a community decided wisely to create a communal repository of books and they set up an institution that would guard them.

29:47.181 --> 29:51.906
And the institution does not have the right to despoil that

29:52.493 --> 29:58.782
communal repository and to privatize it by sending the books to landfills or giving them away.

29:58.842 --> 30:03.910
That's a waste of millions of dollars of public money.

30:04.110 --> 30:14.906
And you can quantify it because you can estimate the number of books that San Francisco got rid of is in the hundreds of thousands.

30:14.926 --> 30:21.536
And they have themselves, when they did their earthquake calculations, they made a lot of money on the earthquake.

30:21.576 --> 30:21.876
And they

30:22.413 --> 30:33.809
did it in part by using a standard Bowker's value of, I think it's five or ten dollars or something per lost book.

30:34.089 --> 30:37.154
Did he really use that phrase, the Augien stables?

30:37.975 --> 30:38.916
Is that how you pronounce it?

30:38.936 --> 30:39.938
Yes, yes, he did use that.

30:39.958 --> 30:41.760
That's unbelievable.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.544
He's basically calling these books bullshit, in other words.

30:44.604 --> 30:46.707
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

30:47.148 --> 30:48.369
You talk about a metaphor.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.053
That's unbelievable.

30:51.073 --> 30:51.694
You know, you don't,

30:52.585 --> 31:12.985
I think he, I think he's clearly, I think he, I mean, I don't want to impute things to him because that seems to be, but from everything that I've heard about him, he likes new things.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.146
That's what he was hired to do.

31:14.486 --> 31:15.207
Gadgetry.

31:15.687 --> 31:17.689
And fill the shelves with new stuff.

31:17.949 --> 31:21.833
He got rid of, you know, just forget the books, the LPs.

31:22.758 --> 31:28.224
I mean, LP collectors are a strange and fascinating finder.

31:28.264 --> 31:29.405
They know what's valuable.

31:29.485 --> 31:44.241
And it's true that library LPs are often beat up, but they were going out on those flatbed trucks were thousands of LPs because the library decided that it was going to go and have a CD collection.

31:44.261 --> 31:49.727
It's not like the CD collection replaced the LP collection because what's available on CDs is different.

31:50.399 --> 31:57.253
But there was no chance for LP collectors at other libraries or individuals to get those things.

31:57.273 --> 32:00.039
Plus, we know that CDs, by the way, deteriorate over time.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.202
I didn't know that.

32:01.222 --> 32:08.858
Yeah, I mean, there's no guarantee that CDs are going to have anything close to the permanence of vinyl.

32:09.279 --> 32:09.519
Really?

32:09.679 --> 32:10.922
Oh, yeah.

32:10.902 --> 32:13.846
That's one of the major concerns you're running into now.

32:13.946 --> 32:20.233
I mean, these things, you better keep the digital information because CDs do deteriorate.

32:20.714 --> 32:22.556
I've been talking to people.

32:22.937 --> 32:25.300
I'm going into the preservation angle, by the way.

32:26.061 --> 32:33.289
All these little phrases that I'm coming up, and you have some beautiful ones in here, just, you know, see the librarian for information.

32:33.810 --> 32:40.318
The words and phrases, these euphemisms that they're using, you know, to describe what they're doing.

32:40.298 --> 32:47.155
It's a fantastic, I mean, migration is a word, you know, the migration of the information.

32:47.736 --> 32:57.801
You know, once you digitize stuff, but of course, like when I was at Cornell, they said, you know, our responsibility is to make sure that we migrate the material that we have developed.

32:57.781 --> 33:02.387
digitally scanned or whatever as the operating systems change, right?

33:02.828 --> 33:02.948
Right.

33:02.968 --> 33:03.749
Who's to make sure?

33:03.809 --> 33:15.926
You know, I mean, I said, but I'll bet right now as we speak on this campus, and this is the woman who's in charge of Cornell, that you have thousands of perforated cards that you don't have the equipment to read that contain material.

33:15.966 --> 33:18.449
You wouldn't have a clue as to how to access it if you want.

33:18.470 --> 33:19.070
She said, you're right.

33:20.112 --> 33:20.452
Yeah.

33:20.472 --> 33:26.100
And there's always, there's every, every upgrade has its, has its, um,

33:27.295 --> 33:37.847
has a kind of margin around which, and we all make this decision, do we want to convert all those old, whatever they were, files?

33:38.067 --> 33:40.310
There has to be, and somebody, I guess, is starting this.

33:40.390 --> 33:41.731
I was reading about the preservation.

33:41.771 --> 33:54.045
There has to be a national software repository with all revs of software sent to them the way you send books to the Library of Congress or the Bodleian or something.

33:54.582 --> 34:09.663
That way, in a hundred years, if there's some novel by some novelist who turns out to be the greatest person around who died young and left his stuff on disc, you could actually read the thing.

34:09.683 --> 34:10.725
Well, that's right.

34:11.045 --> 34:13.188
That's exactly right.

34:13.228 --> 34:17.374
And is there an archival copy of everything that's been digitized?

34:17.574 --> 34:19.397
Who's responsible for that?

34:19.777 --> 34:21.079
There's been nothing.

34:21.498 --> 34:26.483
Are you familiar with the site D-L-I-B D-L-I-B Digital Library?

34:27.504 --> 34:29.085
Are you familiar with that?

34:29.105 --> 34:30.186
Yeah, take a look at it.

34:30.287 --> 34:33.830
I mean, they actually have things on there about what the minimum standards are.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.693
You know, I mean, what's acceptable loss?

34:37.333 --> 34:42.619
You know, I mean, it's almost like, you know, what's acceptable loss in a nuclear exchange?

34:44.841 --> 34:51.387
What are you willing to accept as loss, basically, I guess, is the kinds of things they're talking about in there.

34:51.974 --> 34:52.835
Right.

34:53.255 --> 35:03.446
The thing that I don't understand is why is it that it's... The reasons that they're giving simply fail to convince me.

35:03.947 --> 35:15.239
They always say that libraries are running out of space, but it cannot be that libraries are running out of space because they say it at the same time.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.302
They build these vast new symbolic...

35:19.379 --> 35:20.620
libraries.

35:20.660 --> 35:30.510
And the cost of simply storing things isn't what's killing these libraries.

35:30.630 --> 35:38.257
It's really the huge cost of buying all this equipment and hiring the staff to tend it and all that.

35:38.357 --> 35:42.981
So it isn't an economic decision.

35:43.001 --> 35:47.766
It's a kind of religious enthusiasm that has swept over

35:48.995 --> 35:59.230
all these library administrators, and they're all supporting each other and kind of, I don't know.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.874
And have you ever talked to Dowlin, by the way?

36:02.415 --> 36:03.056
Yeah.

36:03.076 --> 36:07.121
And how have your discussions been?

36:07.141 --> 36:08.043
Have they been cordial?

36:08.143 --> 36:18.478
Well, I mean, you know, by the time I talked to him, I asked to interview him while I was working on his speech, and he didn't want to, or he

36:18.830 --> 36:22.274
I guess he ignored it until he... I know what happened.

36:22.294 --> 36:43.839
The very day of the speech, when finally the posters were going up saying that I was going to give this speech, even though I'd requested the interview, I don't know, three weeks before that or so, he sent a letter saying that he would be happy to interview with me.

36:44.139 --> 36:47.723
So anyway, after I gave that speech, I...

36:49.053 --> 36:50.755
I took him up on it.

36:52.817 --> 37:11.714
But at that point, he then said he couldn't interview me because I was suing the library for those various files, the withdrawn book files.

37:11.734 --> 37:13.836
So you were involved in litigation, in other words.

37:14.077 --> 37:15.118
Right, so I couldn't interview him.

37:15.398 --> 37:16.579
Well, that seems reasonable.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.711
But I have talked to them briefly here and there.

37:19.731 --> 37:24.498
I mean, I got up at Library Commission meetings.

37:24.518 --> 37:28.824
But really, it was very impressive for a while after I gave the speech.

37:29.364 --> 37:35.192
The way Coulter and Dowlin handled it was just, they just sat there at these meetings.

37:35.212 --> 37:38.176
And people were so upset.

37:39.057 --> 37:46.988
You know, librarians were getting up there and members of the public and everything saying, you know, it was really a...

37:47.879 --> 38:05.584
a kind of thrilling, I don't know, ratification of the book as a valuable and permanent artifact or something.

38:06.425 --> 38:10.171
And people were just saying that over and over again.

38:10.271 --> 38:11.553
But they were just silent.

38:11.573 --> 38:13.315
I mean, they didn't say anything.

38:13.355 --> 38:15.979
Do you think they would say we can't comment on any part of this?

38:16.752 --> 38:21.597
We will be issuing some response to it at some point.

38:21.617 --> 38:25.362
But now I know it's just the standard bureaucratic.

38:26.483 --> 38:34.612
You listen, you pretend to listen, but essentially you're thinking, well, we'll let them go for another 20 minutes and then we'll get on to business.

38:34.632 --> 38:43.602
Do you think he sees himself as a kind of fallen angel, a darling, or do you think he's going to be a phoenix to rise from the ashes someplace else?

38:44.963 --> 38:46.405
I don't think he...

38:47.009 --> 39:03.370
I don't know what he sees of himself as, but I think that the problems at San Francisco are so bad and there's so many different kinds of problems.

39:03.390 --> 39:12.983
There's the damage to the collection, but also all these strange financial stories that I think he's...

39:16.203 --> 39:18.745
You know, who can predict?

39:19.406 --> 39:23.670
If I wanted to get in touch with him, I'd love to do an interview with him when I come out there this fall.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.451
Yeah, why not?

39:25.491 --> 39:32.497
He's a fascinating person because he's... I think he's down in San Jose, though.

39:32.878 --> 39:36.141
Well, that's fine, but I'd love to get his take on this whole thing.

39:36.161 --> 39:37.762
Does he believe he was victimized?

39:38.142 --> 39:39.844
Does he think that you were out to get him?

39:39.904 --> 39:40.705
That kind of stuff.

39:41.365 --> 39:44.488
Well, I think he does, because I think I've heard...

39:45.110 --> 39:56.742
You know, and they... Well, who can... Somebody who has been removed from power is going to be hurt an angry person.

39:56.762 --> 40:03.750
That's perfectly understandable, and they're going to... And I did play a small part in that removal.

40:04.571 --> 40:05.372
Maybe a large part.

40:05.412 --> 40:14.121
I wanted him to go because I felt that he had done what I think of as truly...

40:15.316 --> 40:28.593
horrible, if not just in a standard legal sense, criminal things to this collection.

40:28.633 --> 40:30.115
So I wanted him to go.

40:31.657 --> 40:38.826
But I'm perfectly happy to have him say bad things about me now, because that's sort of all he can do.

40:40.168 --> 40:42.150
Of course, a lot of the attacks on you were personal.

40:42.839 --> 40:43.780
Yeah.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.602
I mean, I can even see it in the stuff you sent me.

40:45.642 --> 40:47.844
You know, you breeze into town and you breeze out.

40:47.984 --> 40:50.107
That kind of stuff.

40:50.127 --> 40:55.993
You want to address that in any way that you feel appropriate?

40:56.093 --> 41:04.762
Well, I think there was just a general feeling of desperation.

41:05.883 --> 41:07.365
Something terrible had gone on.

41:07.385 --> 41:12.070
Many thousands of books had been destroyed and there had been no...

41:13.366 --> 41:18.191
no records kept, and the whole thing was really bad.

41:18.412 --> 41:39.335
And people who would normally be sensible, I think, maybe, members of the Library Foundation and things, were so upset that this thing that had seemed like such a success, this great new building, turned out over time to be kind of a disaster.

41:39.856 --> 41:40.977
So they had to

41:41.615 --> 41:49.805
I was the first person to say it publicly so aggressively.

41:49.885 --> 42:01.459
I mean, to talk about, say, the sorting room, which was one of the many disasters, you know, this tiny room mounded high with books so that books were being destroyed when they were returned.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.764
That was all really bad PR for the friends of the library.

42:05.904 --> 42:09.208
So they naturally were frothing at the mouth about it.

42:09.931 --> 42:19.262
And the attacks were personal because there is no way to defend the sorting room, and there is no way to defend the library's self-mutilation.

42:19.302 --> 42:39.347
I mean, they can't... I just don't... I think it's just a very familiar kind of reaction, which is to attack...

42:39.766 --> 42:46.915
me personally because I'm charging them with mismanagement.

42:47.535 --> 42:51.020
There was a terrific piece in the LA Times that somebody sent me in February.

42:51.040 --> 42:51.861
Did you see that piece?

42:52.902 --> 42:56.126
I'll be happy to either fax it to you or send it.

42:56.246 --> 43:00.431
I was getting kind of a shipment of clippings from some of the librarians at the library.

43:00.491 --> 43:01.552
Yeah, this one was good.

43:01.713 --> 43:04.997
In fact, somebody in Illinois sent it to me.

43:05.037 --> 43:07.900
Well, this is how it came to me, but I just got it recently.

43:08.234 --> 43:10.918
But, you know, they quote Tilly Olson in there.

43:11.899 --> 43:16.265
I mean, you are by no means alone in your views.

43:16.385 --> 43:22.073
I mean, you're not just this Jeremiah figure, you know, screaming from the outside.

43:22.093 --> 43:23.334
Oh, I know.

43:23.374 --> 43:37.954
And that was, I thought, was really what was unfair about some of the reactions was that they were trying to kind of make me this

43:38.609 --> 43:45.840
this crackpot who had a bee in his bonnet about card catalogs came from nowhere without any support and said all these things.

43:46.862 --> 43:59.842
But it was very useful to them because then they could ignore the fact that 30 other people stood up at meetings saying all sorts of related things.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.787
And they didn't know me and I didn't know them.

44:02.867 --> 44:04.870
I mean, the library...

44:05.693 --> 44:14.849
dissidents, or whatever they were called, the people who have some major disagreement with the library, go way back.

44:15.129 --> 44:18.856
Coulter has been fought for years.

44:19.597 --> 44:23.243
And it's true that I'm a come here in this.

44:23.264 --> 44:25.447
And I do think there's two unfortunate things.

44:25.588 --> 44:29.895
One is that all those people...

44:32.272 --> 44:39.925
have not gotten sufficient credit for their long years of trying to oppose these policies.

44:39.965 --> 44:50.162
And also I think the librarians themselves haven't gotten sufficient credit for having saved large numbers of books that were

44:50.783 --> 45:14.243
on discard trucks and ready to go you indicated that you might be able to put me in contact with some of these librarians yeah well i i talked to andrea grimes she says she she met you at a at some convention or something very briefly or said hello or saw you passing because you while you were doing research for your book but right um she's in san francisco

45:14.442 --> 45:17.145
She's one of the special collections.

45:17.165 --> 45:18.226
So where did I meet her now?

45:18.546 --> 45:19.047
I wonder where I met her.

45:19.107 --> 45:20.148
I don't know, but she could tell you.

45:20.168 --> 45:22.450
But anyway, she's... So I can give her a call?

45:22.771 --> 45:23.171
Yeah.

45:23.191 --> 45:23.411
Oh, great.

45:23.431 --> 45:24.312
Let me give you her number.

45:24.452 --> 45:25.633
Okay, good.

45:25.654 --> 45:28.416
Although... God damn.

45:28.436 --> 45:29.738
Where the hell did I meet her now?

45:30.478 --> 45:35.644
I think... No, it was just... It's painful these last two years.

45:35.704 --> 45:39.808
Well, I don't think she's assuming that you would...

45:40.666 --> 45:43.749
No, I like the story.

45:43.769 --> 45:45.831
It's getting better and better for me.

45:46.732 --> 45:48.434
This L.A.

45:48.454 --> 45:55.340
Times piece, for instance, it identifies a couple of great panthers who are saving books until the day they can be returned.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.623
I mean, that's a great little story, isn't it?

45:58.023 --> 45:58.203
Right.

45:58.243 --> 46:03.208
These old people who are taking... One of them is the one that I quote in... Exactly, yeah.

46:03.448 --> 46:03.649
Yeah.

46:03.969 --> 46:04.930
And the L.A.

46:04.950 --> 46:07.112
Times piece, I think that the guy...

46:08.543 --> 46:10.767
Yeah, kind of followed up on some of those.

46:10.967 --> 46:17.678
The Grey Panthers woman is a really nice, smart woman who simply cares about books.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.564
What's her name?

46:21.584 --> 46:23.247
That's an irresistible story for me.

46:23.548 --> 46:23.748
Yeah.

46:24.269 --> 46:27.234
Okay, well, let me just think of what her name is.

46:27.254 --> 46:29.177
It's in the story, so you don't have to worry about it.

46:29.297 --> 46:29.898
I can find her.

46:30.078 --> 46:31.100
Yeah, no, I got it, though.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.764
I can give you her number.

46:33.905 --> 46:35.327
It's...

46:46.023 --> 46:46.904
Deetje Boler.

46:47.545 --> 46:49.107
How do you spell it, B-O?

46:49.127 --> 46:51.991
Deetje is D-E-E-T-J-E.

46:52.491 --> 46:53.673
Okay, that is the name, too, yeah.

46:54.134 --> 46:56.757
Deetje, and Boler is B-O-L-E-R.

46:57.017 --> 46:58.339
Yep.

46:58.359 --> 47:01.022
And her number is 415-752-4688.

47:01.924 --> 47:08.152
Oh, that's great.

47:08.172 --> 47:08.692
Terrific.

47:09.634 --> 47:10.855
And Andrea is 415?

47:12.157 --> 47:12.597
Right.

47:12.738 --> 47:13.819
Well, she gave me her...
