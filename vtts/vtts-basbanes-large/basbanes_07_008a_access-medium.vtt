WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:11.230
We're talking to Father William Monaghan, M-O-N-A-H-A-N, and we're at the Gleason Library.

00:11.510 --> 00:12.191
M-O-N-I-H-A-N.

00:12.772 --> 00:14.714
M-O-N-I-H-A-N, I'm sorry.

00:16.116 --> 00:16.276
William.

00:16.296 --> 00:20.281
William, and we're at the Gleason Library at the University of San Francisco.

00:20.362 --> 00:22.384
Father, why don't you just watch your little tour?

00:22.444 --> 00:32.097
Now, we have one of the major collections, these are major collections along here, and Norman Strauss, whom I'm sorry you'll not be able to interview him,

00:32.397 --> 00:33.558
He's well up in years.

00:33.658 --> 00:39.845
He just is not able to do so, but he's one of the great collectors in America, and the first one we received was the Thomas More Award.

00:40.305 --> 00:45.370
Well, he gave us this collection of the Richard Ledalien.

00:45.771 --> 00:52.197
Richard Ledalien was born in England and was the carnivore of the English 1890s.

00:52.657 --> 01:02.067
So we have formed, with his encouragement, an English 1890s collection, and so we have not only

01:02.519 --> 01:05.984
the outstanding books of his, but manuscripts.

01:06.004 --> 01:10.650
Those are manuscripts and autographs.

01:10.690 --> 01:13.895
The Oscar Wilde was the center to that group.

01:14.456 --> 01:16.258
We were too late to get an Oscar Wilde.

01:16.518 --> 01:20.764
We at least got in the man who told the story, Boswell of Oscar Wilde.

01:20.784 --> 01:21.666
That's Legallien.

01:21.726 --> 01:23.168
Legallien.

01:23.188 --> 01:27.293
And the daughter is Eva Legallien.

01:27.714 --> 01:28.095
Eva?

01:29.016 --> 01:29.096
Eva.

01:29.517 --> 01:32.020
And she's on theater in America, stage

01:32.506 --> 01:38.151
And she came here one time, and she was so pleased, and she said, well, I'm going to be sure that some of my things will come here, too.

01:38.572 --> 01:38.872
That's great.

01:38.932 --> 01:48.301
So this is a, you do what you can do, and we had the opportunity to get the man who told the story of England's 189s, even though we didn't get the Oscar Wilde as the center of the whole thing.

01:48.321 --> 01:51.224
That's the essence of your collecting that, meaning to interrupt, you do what you can do.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.948
That could almost be a credo for you, isn't it?

01:55.048 --> 01:55.889
It is, it is.

01:55.929 --> 01:56.629
What's available?

01:57.050 --> 02:01.534
Then the Haussmanns, A. Haussmann, the Shropshire-led, and Lawrence Haussmanns,

02:01.717 --> 02:11.447
are also a major work collection, and we obtained the Lawrence Haussmann work collection from a local collector here in the area.

02:12.188 --> 02:18.554
And the A. Haussmann we've added to, but not substantially, simply because we're late.

02:18.755 --> 02:19.896
We're too late in doing it.

02:20.076 --> 02:21.678
We have some substantial things.

02:21.698 --> 02:23.379
One of the major collections— Pardon me.

02:23.399 --> 02:25.822
Manuscripts or mainly printed books on the house base?

02:25.842 --> 02:26.863
Also, some manuscripts.

02:26.883 --> 02:29.766
They're not—some autographs—letters.

02:29.797 --> 02:32.940
But those are so pricey now, $4,000 and $5,000.

02:32.980 --> 02:42.229
Now, Eric Gill is one of the major collections in America, maybe four or five major collections of Eric Gill in America.

02:42.289 --> 02:58.926
Texas, UCLA are two other major ones, and probably the Boston Museum, the Boston Museum Y. So this is a major collection here, and now you're only seeing sort of a showcase of it, because underneath the exhibit case over there,

02:59.210 --> 03:02.875
actual prints, proofs, drawings, and so on.

03:03.276 --> 03:07.982
So it's not exhaustive, but we're one component part in America of the Eric Gill collection.

03:08.263 --> 03:09.905
If you study Eric Gill, you have to come here.

03:09.985 --> 03:11.687
Sure, that's right.

03:11.707 --> 03:19.017
And then here are some cuts that he made and filled with gesso to make them an ornamental thing.

03:19.698 --> 03:21.381
This is quite a beautiful room, by the way.

03:21.441 --> 03:22.863
Is this something that you designed?

03:22.883 --> 03:26.668
Well, the former librarian, one of the former librarians that are designing it,

03:26.918 --> 03:33.506
But a lady friend and volunteer got the money from Dan Murphy Foundation in Los Angeles.

03:34.006 --> 03:37.190
So that was a very, that's a major step ahead to get it through.

03:37.751 --> 03:43.637
Because I wanted to show to our friends, we know how to take care of things.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.300
That's the most important thing we can do.

03:46.461 --> 03:47.382
To get their confidence.

03:47.402 --> 03:52.508
We exhibit, we keep them, we keep up the maintenance of it and so on.

03:52.528 --> 03:54.450
Now, anyhow, this is a representative.

03:54.490 --> 03:56.352
Now, then, Robert Graves.

03:56.905 --> 04:07.579
Early in the 1960s, a collector, local wool collector, put in our hands, and I call it in trust, because whatever we receive is for the public or benefit.

04:07.599 --> 04:10.042
But in trust is Robert Graves' collection.

04:10.703 --> 04:13.507
Well, it was basically a first edition collection.

04:13.747 --> 04:16.070
We have added on the early wool variants.

04:16.431 --> 04:21.998
We have both autograph letters and manuscripts, so it's a major watcher of Robert Graves' collection.

04:22.018 --> 04:24.381
How many volumes would you guess?

04:24.715 --> 04:26.978
Well, I would say several hundred.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.268
But the guts, the real sources are the autographed letters and manuscripts.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.152
So this is both Robert Bates.

04:36.172 --> 04:39.437
HRC of Texas has a pretty good Graves collection, too.

04:39.537 --> 04:40.138
I'm sure.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.602
Well, they've done very well in so many others.

04:42.622 --> 04:46.047
Now, here is the sort of showcase for the Thomas More collection.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.870
The rest of it's on the other side there.

04:47.890 --> 04:48.631
These are gorgeous.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.195
My God.

04:51.378 --> 04:58.868
It was a primary collection formed by a collector in San Francisco, who was a lawyer and a dean of the Hastings Law School.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.151
And his name?

05:04.736 --> 05:05.437
Morris Harrison.

05:05.577 --> 05:06.379
Maurice Harrison.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.101
Maurice Harrison.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.045
Correct.

05:11.065 --> 05:17.654
And so we were able to buy this in 1951, before we had any price, any money.

05:18.175 --> 05:20.558
I went to my folks who said I wanted to borrow.

05:20.757 --> 05:24.461
8,000 bucks, and they said, we'll give you 8,000 bucks.

05:24.481 --> 05:25.462
So anyhow, this is how this is.

05:25.482 --> 05:26.823
You get this for 8,000 dollars?

05:26.843 --> 05:27.083
Yeah, 8,000.

05:27.103 --> 05:29.606
Oh my God, there are single items here worth more than 8,000.

05:29.626 --> 05:30.567
That's why I'm smiling.

05:30.607 --> 05:34.330
I'm looking at some, I don't know if there are any incunables here.

05:34.390 --> 05:40.817
These are the represent people of the 17th century, Western and the English Catholics from the Northern continent.

05:41.077 --> 05:43.619
But down here is the real sources.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.203
These are the first editions of Moores' Utopia.

05:47.437 --> 05:49.919
It belonged to the family of Thomas More, the grandson.

05:50.239 --> 05:52.121
That was his copy, William Roper's copy.

05:52.261 --> 05:53.382
Which one is the utopia?

05:54.443 --> 05:57.045
William Roper's copy of the English Works, 1557.

05:57.946 --> 06:02.290
I saw a utopia go at the Bradley, was at the Bradley Martin sale for about a half a million dollars.

06:04.672 --> 06:11.858
Now, we are specializing, not specializing, but we are getting opportunities to collect fine printing.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.780
Now, this is the Book Hub of California.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.022
The Book Hub of California has used

06:17.609 --> 06:29.286
has used very fine printers in San Francisco over 60 years, and so we have a near-complete collection of the Book of California.

06:30.047 --> 06:42.484
The Graveline Press, another San Francisco press, although it was in the Midwest and then in Seattle, in the front here, well-known, this is not a complete but near-complete collection of Graveline.

06:44.407 --> 06:47.211
And then we have a friend, a library associate,

06:47.647 --> 06:49.369
who makes cases for us.

06:49.769 --> 06:51.291
So those lovely cases here.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.936
But all the way throughout here, they suggest exquisite cases.

06:55.956 --> 07:02.183
Now, one of the things I was interested in is, well, I'm interested in people, and people are my specialty.

07:03.084 --> 07:05.927
And so I was able to get— People are your specialty?

07:05.947 --> 07:07.109
Yes, my specialty, yeah.

07:08.330 --> 07:15.358
And I knew a lady who was a collector at Robinson and Jefferies, who was a friend of Robinson and Jefferies,

07:15.912 --> 07:23.601
And so she's deceased now, and the daughter was the one who gave us this great collection of Robertson Jeffers.

07:23.681 --> 07:27.226
Now, this is a California poet, I think of considerable standing.

07:27.726 --> 07:30.389
I saw his house next to Sandy Berger's place.

07:30.770 --> 07:31.231
You were.

07:31.431 --> 07:31.811
You were.

07:32.632 --> 07:34.635
You certainly covered the ground.

07:35.516 --> 07:42.604
Anyhow, we have about 150 autographed letters of the wife, Mrs. Jeffers.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.907
That's a very important collection.

07:45.106 --> 07:45.767
I think so.

07:46.147 --> 07:52.336
Now, certainly, we had a good base, but we didn't have this quality.

07:53.677 --> 07:56.261
In many areas, we have a good base to start with.

07:57.603 --> 08:07.315
Now, over here is another printer from about 1900 to 1945, John Henry Nash.

08:07.335 --> 08:13.864
And in our area, this is a well-known name, so that the people of

08:14.232 --> 08:22.287
the Stanford people in the 1920s and 30s and 40s, and people here at USF, when they have a special occasion, we'd have it done by John Henry Nash.

08:22.608 --> 08:24.932
Well, we have near complete recollection.

08:24.952 --> 08:29.942
Now, his patrons were Charles and William Andrews Clark.

08:30.603 --> 08:33.709
William Andrews Clark gave his library to UCLA.

08:34.347 --> 08:39.091
So the major library of Folk and Dryden and other people like that at UCLA.

08:39.392 --> 08:40.833
This is the William Andrews Clark Library.

08:41.093 --> 08:44.556
We'll have the patrons of John Henry Nash, William Andrews Clark.

08:46.498 --> 08:53.845
Interesting, you're picking around the corners in the periphery of the La Gallienne collection from the Clark.

08:53.945 --> 08:56.027
Yeah, yeah.

08:56.047 --> 08:58.329
It's very important because you're filling in the gaps, too.

08:58.349 --> 08:59.149
Yeah.

08:59.169 --> 09:03.173
Now, here is, I'm giving one picture here of an artist

09:04.250 --> 09:08.195
Well, that's Dean.

09:08.795 --> 09:09.736
D-E-A-N.

09:09.937 --> 09:11.699
M-A-L-L-E-T-E.

09:12.099 --> 09:13.120
Now, that's Dean.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.201
Okay.

09:14.222 --> 09:20.128
He's a local artist who died about ten years ago and did some marvelous work.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.890
This is a double image, by the way.

09:22.351 --> 09:27.477
I don't know how to describe it artistically, but it gives the depth, like the rain is on it.

09:27.557 --> 09:28.418
It's beautiful.

09:28.618 --> 09:31.962
So, it's a glowing gate, but he is a

09:32.448 --> 09:39.997
We have a master of a collection of his work, so one of the families were allowed us to acquire a major collection.

09:40.017 --> 09:41.558
What is the motif?

09:42.800 --> 09:47.745
Well, the motif is a Japanese style of print.

09:47.765 --> 09:48.126
I see.

09:48.146 --> 09:49.167
But the subject is .

09:49.427 --> 09:54.013
I'm just curious how he did it.

09:54.854 --> 10:00.480
Well, that takes more knowledge of art in a practical sense than I have.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.751
But it's a double image.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.033
It's a double image.

10:03.233 --> 10:06.156
That's how he signed it, H.M.D., right?

10:06.176 --> 10:07.097
H.M.D., yeah.

10:07.117 --> 10:10.161
So here's what the Harold Malet-Deema has.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.223
He was known to us as the Malet-Dean.

10:13.164 --> 10:14.366
Okay.

10:14.386 --> 10:18.090
Now, that we don't, I mean, if Steve Poirier were here, he could show you that.

10:18.310 --> 10:23.076
But I wanted to move into this artist, Victor Hammer.

10:24.878 --> 10:28.081
Victor Hammer was from Europe, from Austria.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.623
Wow.

10:30.042 --> 10:36.391
worked with Rudolf Koch, K-O-C-H, or maybe his son did.

10:37.372 --> 10:47.947
But Victor Hammer, this is his part, a self-portrait, a man in York City, when he heard that we got this collection of Victor Hammer from Norma Strauss.

10:48.428 --> 10:50.350
I'm speaking about... Oh, again, this is Rich Strauss again.

10:50.390 --> 10:52.313
Yeah, Norma Strauss, yeah.

10:52.333 --> 10:59.543
So this Mr. Kaufman, Kaufman in York City, was very generous and honest to take over

11:00.080 --> 11:06.648
at the Public Trust is the self-portrait of Richard Hammond, which I think is very funny.

11:07.248 --> 11:11.513
This is of the nine newses, the nine newses which I just wrote it down.

11:11.673 --> 11:16.078
I really don't, I'm not too warm towards that, but I'm still coming in.

11:16.098 --> 11:16.719
You don't like that?

11:17.280 --> 11:18.221
I'm not wowed about it.

11:19.062 --> 11:21.665
Content or execution?

11:21.685 --> 11:28.112
Well, the handling of the subject matter, all the faces are the same.

11:28.514 --> 11:32.217
And I should not say I don't like it because don't put that in print.

11:33.418 --> 11:36.161
As far as taste goes, I like the idea of music.

11:36.181 --> 11:40.685
I like the idea of being here in the library because we should have the nine music.

11:40.705 --> 11:46.991
But I just would say as far as artistic accomplishment, I don't think it is as great as this.

11:47.011 --> 11:49.213
This, I think, is a very fine self-portrait.

11:49.753 --> 11:55.218
That's very important because even though you personally may not like something, that doesn't mean you don't think it belongs in the collection.

11:55.238 --> 11:57.340
You're not imposing your artistic...

11:57.843 --> 12:00.887
catechism, so to speak, on the collection.

12:00.907 --> 12:06.875
But the Hammer, the eight design typefaces, and the Unsell, Hammer Unsell is famous for it.

12:06.895 --> 12:07.456
Oh, that's very famous.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.337
Sure it is.

12:08.357 --> 12:09.819
I didn't realize that we were talking about it.

12:09.839 --> 12:19.572
So this is the source here, and his second wife is still alive in Kentucky, and I still haven't gotten to see her in Lexington.

12:19.592 --> 12:27.462
So now, then I'll show you, this is a

12:28.302 --> 12:30.125
painting by a Jesuit.

12:30.145 --> 12:30.586
Beautiful.

12:30.726 --> 12:40.761
Went to China in the 17th century, and then the emperor, like the Jesuits, who came from Europe.

12:40.781 --> 12:41.442
That's gorgeous.

12:41.462 --> 12:44.988
So he gave him a full-time job to paint for him.

12:45.008 --> 12:47.171
Now, this is the confine of the emperor.

12:47.211 --> 12:48.113
The concubine.

12:48.133 --> 12:50.616
This is a concubine, a Pakistani woman.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.601
And you see these three faces, all the same person.

12:53.885 --> 12:57.910
because they participated with the vice, yes, I don't know if that's true.

12:57.930 --> 13:23.183
But the artist is Giuseppe Castiglione, C-A-S-T-I-G-L-I-O-N-E, G-I-U-S-E-P-P-E, the years of 1688 to 1766, Jesuit artist at the Chinese Imperial Court from 1715, known as Lang Chi Ning, that's L-A-N-G-C-H-I-H-N-I-N-G, and this is a picture I've

13:23.737 --> 13:32.270
painting of Princess, H-S-I-N-G-F-E-I, with S words, Serga, 1750, watercolor on silk.

13:32.290 --> 13:33.832
This is my type.

13:34.754 --> 13:39.181
Well, this has not been proven to be a genuine Castagnoni.

13:39.702 --> 13:47.213
There's a book of the known masterworks, but a Chinese Jesuit kind of mind says,

13:47.395 --> 13:48.877
I think it's very genuine.

13:48.897 --> 13:49.397
It's beautiful.

13:49.417 --> 13:59.969
Somebody did it, that's for sure, and it's quite— And it's a European—a European will matter, but still, it's a size of name in Chinese, yeah?

14:00.009 --> 14:00.369
Okay.

14:02.371 --> 14:03.953
This is a gift of Arthur—Mr.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.076
and Mrs. Arthur Gambarassi.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.900
Yes.

14:11.921 --> 14:12.542
Okay.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.378
This is the place.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.064
And these are the folio, folio books.

14:24.084 --> 14:28.449
And again, it's collecting as we could collect.

14:28.469 --> 14:34.836
Norman Strauss gave us this wonderful collection of Habler, which are the single leaves of Inconabula books.

14:34.856 --> 14:36.058
Oh, right.

14:36.578 --> 14:38.020
H-A-E-B-L-E-R.

14:38.601 --> 14:38.701
Yeah.

14:38.721 --> 14:40.263
The Italian Inconabula.

14:40.283 --> 14:40.383
Yeah.

14:41.124 --> 14:45.128
See, it's German, German, Italian, Italian, West European.

14:45.395 --> 14:50.823
One, two, three, it's six long, flat, folio-sized cases, I would say.

14:54.768 --> 14:54.968
Yeah.

14:54.988 --> 14:55.209
1927.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.310
And Hebler is who?

14:56.330 --> 15:00.236
That was the— Hebler was the scholar, the German scholar who put it out.

15:00.856 --> 15:05.202
So it was 19— Oh, it's 27, yeah.

15:05.222 --> 15:08.467
27 to 30, I guess it is.

15:08.487 --> 15:10.890
27, 28 in three years.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.853
But this is just—

15:13.795 --> 15:14.736
Leaves.

15:15.096 --> 15:15.397
Leaves.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.279
Leaves, but studies on them, so by a scholar.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.102
This is the Plantin Bible here.

15:21.583 --> 15:26.488
This is the Plantin Bible, and another set of this established Leiden University.

15:26.848 --> 15:34.696
Leiden University, a page of William of Orange, established the, what is today, the Leiden University of Leiden with this set.

15:34.976 --> 15:35.297
Really?

15:35.437 --> 15:38.960
We got this as a gift after the earthquake and fire in 1906.

15:39.341 --> 15:40.782
They were destroyed completely.

15:40.998 --> 15:44.301
at Hayes in Venice, the center of the city, near the civic center.

15:45.022 --> 15:48.506
And so, but... This Bible is four volumes or eight?

15:48.966 --> 15:50.287
Well, it's four volumes.

15:50.468 --> 15:51.749
Two, four, six, eight.

15:52.129 --> 15:52.630
Eight volumes.

15:53.110 --> 15:57.535
But it's a parallel line, so there are three or four languages.

15:57.855 --> 16:01.038
So it's a... And these are giant folios.

16:01.519 --> 16:02.940
Are these original leather bindings?

16:02.960 --> 16:03.300
Yes, yes.

16:03.321 --> 16:06.324
And about how old are these Bibles, would you say?

16:09.006 --> 16:10.768
The binding...

16:11.052 --> 16:13.414
I would say would be 18th century.

16:13.454 --> 16:21.061
The book itself, 16th century, through the 1500s.

16:21.141 --> 16:24.944
And printed where?

16:25.284 --> 16:27.306
Printed in Antwerp.

16:27.506 --> 16:27.987
In Antwerp?

16:28.788 --> 16:32.831
You know, Phil II was the patron, so he paid for it for the printing.

16:33.332 --> 16:40.738
But for us to have this is one of the cornerstones of fine printing in Europe.

16:41.005 --> 16:42.166
Okay, what do we call it?

16:42.186 --> 16:44.909
The Biblia Regia.

16:45.369 --> 16:48.412
Biblia, B-I-B-L-I-A, R-E-G-I-A.

16:50.254 --> 16:55.999
And Platin, P-L-A-N-T-I-N, is a printer in Antwerp.

16:56.660 --> 17:00.824
And Philip II, the King of Spain, was a patron.

17:01.144 --> 17:02.125
He paid for it.

17:02.145 --> 17:04.107
Okay, so you say this is one of the cornerstones?

17:04.207 --> 17:09.392
The cornerstone of Bible production, Bible printing.

17:09.912 --> 17:19.126
The polygraph before this was in Spain, and I just can't remember the name of it.

17:19.146 --> 17:20.387
But this came to you as a gift?

17:20.608 --> 17:21.209
As a gift?

17:21.349 --> 17:23.051
After the earthquake and from home again?

17:23.192 --> 17:23.652
We don't know.

17:24.113 --> 17:24.534
We don't know.

17:24.674 --> 17:28.940
It was here after 1906, so I would say in the 1910s.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.042
But was it local?

17:30.082 --> 17:31.304
Was it in the city someplace?

17:31.424 --> 17:33.767
I think it probably came as a European gift.

17:34.048 --> 17:34.809
I can only guess.

17:35.009 --> 17:37.413
Well, that's some kind benefactor.

17:37.433 --> 17:38.434
That's right, right.

17:38.549 --> 17:41.133
Yeah, we don't know.

17:41.333 --> 17:41.854
We don't know.

17:41.954 --> 17:43.396
We tried to determine.

17:43.436 --> 17:44.298
We couldn't find out.

17:44.318 --> 17:45.199
We couldn't find out.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.062
What is this gorgeous?

17:47.402 --> 17:51.288
These are the Biblia Sacra, S-A-C-R-A.

17:51.348 --> 17:57.397
This is famous not for the printing or binding, but the Dali, Salvador Dali illustration.

17:57.538 --> 17:58.619
Oh, their Dali illustration.

17:58.639 --> 17:59.601
And it's very exciting.

18:00.702 --> 18:04.388
I can show you later on another going outside there of the same set.

18:04.722 --> 18:05.663
They're very exciting.

18:05.703 --> 18:06.524
What do you call this room?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.766
This is the treasure room?

18:08.267 --> 18:11.571
Well, the stack room for the Red Book.

18:11.711 --> 18:11.971
The what?

18:11.991 --> 18:12.532
The which room?

18:12.552 --> 18:13.253
The stack room.

18:13.293 --> 18:13.634
Stack.

18:13.714 --> 18:14.375
Stack.

18:14.415 --> 18:14.915
Oh, stack.

18:15.015 --> 18:15.336
Okay.

18:15.436 --> 18:17.939
Stack room for the Red Book.

18:17.959 --> 18:22.886
So a lot of things which we have here are misled.

18:23.086 --> 18:25.850
This is an Egyptian of Coptic things.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.432
Oh, you have some Coptic stuff?

18:28.633 --> 18:30.055
Life and miracles of...

18:30.440 --> 18:59.248
T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-K-L-A-T-A-

18:59.566 --> 19:04.651
English 1890s, the Spanish magazine, for doing them.

19:04.671 --> 19:07.694
These are English literary people.

19:09.196 --> 19:24.652
Now, I want to show you, here's a part of a set, a set of On Columbus, which represents one of the big documentary sets of a collection we bought in 1954.

19:25.173 --> 19:29.337
It's called On Columbus and the Navigation of the Voyages of Columbus.

19:30.008 --> 19:35.938
There's George Nunn, annual double-end, taught in the public schools, high schools in San Francisco.

19:35.998 --> 19:39.184
He's a first-rate scholar and historian.

19:39.504 --> 19:40.726
And so that came to us.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.050
But this is just one of the very large questions.

19:43.070 --> 19:43.812
So he gave this to you?

19:43.952 --> 19:46.216
It was not only this, but a whole large collection.

19:46.236 --> 19:47.077
But he was a teacher?

19:47.117 --> 19:47.959
A teacher in high school.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.062
How did he manage to put together such wonderful things?

19:50.102 --> 19:51.825
Precisely on a teacher's salary.

19:51.845 --> 19:52.827
That's a marvelous thing.

19:52.807 --> 19:54.729
Do you know something about this?

19:54.949 --> 19:57.231
Are you going to tell me a little bit about it later?

19:57.311 --> 19:58.052
I will.

19:58.072 --> 19:58.613
I'll try.

19:58.793 --> 20:08.562
At some point after we get through the tour, I've got to tell you what I'm doing, too, so you can appreciate what I'm doing, and then you'll see why you fit in so beautifully.

20:08.583 --> 20:14.969
Well, now, these things here, we are not in a position to have extraordinary collections of our manuscripts.

20:14.989 --> 20:19.393
We have the facsimiles, wonderful facsimiles, a look of kilns.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.295
I know that facsimile.

20:21.443 --> 20:22.304
Isn't it nice?

20:22.324 --> 20:22.484
Yeah.

20:22.605 --> 20:25.729
I know Boston College has it, and they're exceedingly proud of it.

20:26.089 --> 20:29.314
And here's another one.

20:29.454 --> 20:33.880
Thanks to a book collector that wouldn't exist, Robert Cotton.

20:35.142 --> 20:35.602
Ah, yes.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.024
He'll be in my book.

20:37.385 --> 20:37.665
All right.

20:38.086 --> 20:38.606
All right.

20:38.626 --> 20:40.990
Also, Beowulf wouldn't exist if it weren't for cotton.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.271
You've covered a lot of ground.

20:43.874 --> 20:47.258
The Vespasian Psalters wouldn't exist if it weren't for cotton.

20:47.739 --> 20:47.839
Yeah.

20:48.224 --> 20:49.866
These are people that are nuts.

20:49.886 --> 20:51.147
They're enthusiasts.

20:51.187 --> 20:52.268
That's what I'm writing about.

20:53.269 --> 20:54.290
But there's a purpose.

20:54.310 --> 20:58.474
It's the collector not only accumulating, but preserving and saving.

20:58.654 --> 21:01.697
And making it available to the public.

21:01.837 --> 21:04.459
And passing on the product of humans.

21:04.599 --> 21:10.685
Passing on and our institution may go out of existence in a couple of centuries.

21:10.805 --> 21:12.046
Someone else would take it over.

21:12.066 --> 21:14.088
This is what we're supposed to do as human beings.

21:15.169 --> 21:15.970
That's wonderful.

21:17.063 --> 21:20.168
This is largely what you've built, isn't it?

21:20.548 --> 21:34.430
I know you're a modest man, but... Well, I would say I have had a lot to do with it, but the main thing is that I started with an enthusiastic start, and other people carried on.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.894
And so the other thing is fun.

21:39.718 --> 21:41.080
Early on, I knew...

21:41.482 --> 21:47.691
So I could never have a strong library by depending upon university funds, because they would say, we would love to help you.

21:48.072 --> 21:50.235
Sorry, we just can't do it.

21:50.255 --> 21:55.583
But I really went outside, so I became head of the library in 1947.

21:56.004 --> 21:58.267
I went out to meet people.

21:58.287 --> 22:00.491
I've been doing it ever since.

22:00.972 --> 22:06.780
But to me, the thing is, I create enthusiasm among friends to support us.

22:07.241 --> 22:09.244
Now, we have an endowment fund of some size.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.225
But I'm always getting gifts.

22:12.605 --> 22:16.530
So what you're seeing is largely not university funds at all.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.834
This is outside money that's doing this.

22:19.854 --> 22:20.694
And that's your genius, isn't it?

22:20.715 --> 22:27.482
Well, as I say, I know people, I love people, and they love me, and that's how it happens.

22:27.502 --> 22:28.764
That's great.

22:28.784 --> 22:34.830
And we haven't left, for the sake of my transcript, we haven't left row one yet of the spectrum.

22:34.850 --> 22:35.451
Go ahead, sir.

22:39.903 --> 22:50.538
You can see the boxes around here, just loads and loads of things, and it just shows that we need expansion work.

22:50.558 --> 22:57.227
And the head librarian is thinking very seriously about finding more stacking space.

22:57.427 --> 22:59.010
We don't want to change the beautiful room there.

22:59.530 --> 23:01.573
We want more stacking space for the library.

23:02.455 --> 23:06.400
So they're seeing high points, and we're acquiring them all the time.

23:06.869 --> 23:10.273
Benvenuto Cellini, Volume 1 and Volume 2.

23:12.255 --> 23:15.599
These are really wonderful.

23:15.659 --> 23:18.622
I mean, you have many centuries represented here, too, I can see.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.565
Look at that unusual binding.

23:20.685 --> 23:21.506
That looks like this.

23:21.526 --> 23:28.854
That is a copy made of a Latin text under the Mussolini.

23:29.294 --> 23:32.438
No kidding.

23:32.941 --> 23:35.244
The Virgil, the Virgil.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.366
So it's a facsimile of the master.

23:37.667 --> 23:38.127
It's in Greek.

23:38.908 --> 23:39.308
Is that Greek?

23:39.589 --> 23:40.270
No, it's Latin.

23:40.450 --> 23:41.151
Oh, it's Latin.

23:41.191 --> 23:42.472
Capitals.

23:42.492 --> 23:42.913
Latin, Capitals.

23:42.933 --> 23:43.473
No, it's not Greek.

23:43.593 --> 23:45.335
That's not, okay.

23:45.916 --> 23:55.207
But, um, I'm sorry to tell you more specifically, but these are individual books that are important by himself because of Pine.

23:55.647 --> 24:00.273
His edition of this is a direct former owner's.

24:00.293 --> 24:00.433
Mm-hmm.

24:01.072 --> 24:01.853
It's very nice.

24:02.114 --> 24:03.015
That's a gorgeous book.

24:04.998 --> 24:07.602
Do you have any favorites?

24:08.243 --> 24:14.452
Any personal favorites that particularly give you a glow when you... Well, you will hear me as I talk.

24:14.472 --> 24:23.025
I will probably, because I have so many favorites, I can't... But here's a nice thing.

24:23.386 --> 24:25.809
It was done by the Clubbinders.

24:26.390 --> 24:28.754
This is the Gloria Club.

24:28.894 --> 24:30.336
Gloria Club.

24:30.653 --> 24:33.558
And the club wore binders around the beginning of the century.

24:33.578 --> 24:43.695
The wealthy men of the border club hired some binders in New York City, and they're known as the club binders in the 1920s.

24:44.276 --> 24:49.504
And to me, the important thing of this is that the lovely thing has maintained itself throughout the years.

24:49.584 --> 24:50.285
This has been a trade.

24:50.306 --> 24:51.227
What's the title of the book?

24:51.376 --> 24:53.619
Well, it's the life of a coin collector.

24:53.719 --> 24:54.419
I have this book.

24:54.439 --> 24:54.660
You do?

24:55.421 --> 24:55.621
Yeah.

24:55.981 --> 24:56.842
I just got it.

24:56.862 --> 24:57.563
Well, good for you.

24:57.743 --> 24:58.985
I'm a collector.

24:59.906 --> 25:01.147
You'll find out soon.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.069
That's why I recognize it instantly.

25:03.309 --> 25:08.495
That's why you're an ideal person to do what you're doing, because you have a feeling for what we're doing.

25:10.397 --> 25:11.438
Okay.

25:12.159 --> 25:17.806
But this is endless number of things which we have.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.948
This is the first

25:20.182 --> 25:25.026
American Catholic Bible, published in Philadelphia.

25:25.126 --> 25:26.267
It's a very important book.

25:26.527 --> 25:27.288
It's a very important book.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.709
For the University of San Francisco.

25:28.729 --> 25:31.311
It was restored, you see, in the style.

25:31.812 --> 25:37.937
Steve Corey, the curator of this, found out how the other copies were bound in America.

25:37.977 --> 25:38.637
Oh, wonderful.

25:38.718 --> 25:43.962
And so he used the same thing in rebinding, so it looks like it was first in Philadelphia.

25:43.982 --> 25:44.843
What was the year?

25:46.124 --> 25:50.087
It was 1790-something, before the 18th century.

25:51.012 --> 25:55.379
It really was post-revolution before you got a Catholic Bible in the United States.

25:55.399 --> 25:55.919
That's right.

25:55.939 --> 26:07.316
It was Matthew Cary, C-A-R-V-Y, is a major printer in Philadelphia at that time, and a man who knew society.

26:07.396 --> 26:11.302
He was not only living in his shop, but he knew people, and they knew him.

26:11.643 --> 26:20.496
So he's quite a force, and he's not at all a Roman Catholic who was living in a sort of small area, but he tried to sell

26:20.830 --> 26:46.922
the bibles so when god is concerned for the partisans he made lots of money because the fathers were buying bibles so uh anyhow i'm let's continue on because i okay i could get lost with it and there's still and there's still a lot of things we have to talk about too so what do you say we interrupt now okay i'd like that i think that's a good idea and then our conversation may may develop with

26:47.155 --> 26:47.776
I think so.

26:47.796 --> 26:55.325
I think what I've got now is the introduction to the collection, and this would be a good time to chat.

26:56.386 --> 27:16.791
The Sir Thomas Moore Medal, which you conceived a number of years ago and have given, it recognizes the efforts and the achievements of the private book collector, the individual private book collector, and how these collectors have contributed to the preservation

27:17.294 --> 27:19.097
achievement, I guess.

27:19.117 --> 27:20.279
Maybe we'll start with that.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.621
Can I tell you the origin of it?

27:21.701 --> 27:22.302
I wish you would.

27:22.422 --> 27:33.539
I was with the DeGuardia Club in 1967 on one of their European trips.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.245
Not the first, but the third or fourth European trip.

27:37.265 --> 27:45.478
And I had just become a member, T. Waller Barrett, former president of the public, introduced me to the club.

27:45.847 --> 27:47.890
I don't remember in 1966.

27:47.910 --> 27:53.958
But in 1966, that was my first trip with the Gloria Club in Europe, in a stomp home.

27:53.979 --> 28:11.263
We were all assembled in the Royal Library, and the director of the library chose to make an obvious occasion of awarding a medal for book collecting, a major person in Sweden, major collector in Sweden.

28:12.323 --> 28:24.499
got the information there, and the phrase that I captured from them was, private book collecting a public business benefit, a public business benefit.

28:24.519 --> 28:41.301
Now, to me, the collector, I don't want to use hard, I don't want to give any bad connotation to those who don't make it public, but we gain so much from a collector who makes it available, like Huntington, or a...

28:41.939 --> 28:43.181
Morgan.

28:43.381 --> 28:44.363
Morgan, thank you.

28:44.383 --> 28:45.685
I was looking for that name.

28:45.705 --> 28:46.165
Or Morgan.

28:46.346 --> 28:46.766
Folger.

28:47.007 --> 28:47.888
Folger.

28:47.968 --> 28:54.798
People who enjoy collecting, but often being available for those dollars.

28:54.858 --> 29:05.374
That's the theme in my idea, the myth behind the book that we liked so much recently, the name of the rose.

29:05.734 --> 29:10.782
Now, the name of the rose, to me, is a myth of a collector.

29:11.285 --> 29:14.948
who wanted all for himself is destroyed within himself.

29:15.269 --> 29:17.551
But if it's for others, it flourishes.

29:18.172 --> 29:23.076
And cotton, any of these names you mentioned, are people who are interested in the public benefit.

29:24.017 --> 29:31.084
So with that mentor, that model, the Royal Library of Sweden, we followed in their footsteps.

29:31.104 --> 29:35.228
They came back and talked to our library associates, said, why can't we do it?

29:35.808 --> 29:39.672
So Charles Frappier, F-R-A-C-C-H-I-A,

29:40.023 --> 29:41.885
was then the president of our library show.

29:41.905 --> 29:42.926
She said, well, let's do it.

29:43.707 --> 29:46.431
So, in 1968, I met Norman Stumps.

29:46.451 --> 29:51.136
He was still the chairman of the board of J. Walter Thompson in New York City.

29:51.156 --> 29:59.326
So, we had lunch together, and he said, well, I'd like to get there.

30:00.267 --> 30:05.534
And we gave him the offer to receive the first medal.

30:06.475 --> 30:08.477
And he received it, and he said,

30:09.453 --> 30:20.988
When I allowed to California, I'm going to help to make your library great."

30:21.068 --> 30:22.650
He was still living in New York, you see.

30:22.670 --> 30:31.741
He was still living in New York at a time, and in a lovely two-floor penthouse in New York.

30:33.323 --> 30:38.650
But he was a collector who was on the board of the New York Public Library.

30:39.035 --> 30:42.700
He was a donor to the Free Library of Philadelphia.

30:42.720 --> 30:49.168
He was a contributor to many, many institutions.

30:50.129 --> 30:51.932
I will help make your library great.

30:52.012 --> 30:53.294
I will help make your library great.

30:53.314 --> 30:53.754
That's wonderful.

30:53.774 --> 30:54.876
That's wonderful.

30:54.896 --> 31:03.307
Anyhow, and I can name at least seven or eight collections immediately, and many more, that I can identify with his name.

31:03.807 --> 31:07.472
How about giving me a few, just to ... All right.

31:07.756 --> 31:09.298
I think you already showed me one.

31:09.318 --> 31:22.754
This is from John Henry Nash, Book Club of California, Richard McGonaghan, Victor Hammer.

31:22.774 --> 31:23.615
Okay, that's good.

31:25.438 --> 31:26.759
These were his collections?

31:26.999 --> 31:36.531
These were the collections he formed, and he would say to me, you know, I wonder, would you like to have this collection archive?

31:37.085 --> 31:42.894
So when I was screening, it was passionately.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.757
Of course, I would love to have it.

31:45.378 --> 31:52.869
And in accepting any collection, I feel we have a public responsibility to keep that alive, to add to it.

31:53.209 --> 31:56.575
And that's where the funds, which I have collected over the years, come in handy.

31:57.236 --> 32:01.181
So when I see something on the market, I can do quickly and add that to it.

32:01.602 --> 32:04.847
But the Robinson-Jefferson collection, you know, there,

32:05.333 --> 32:17.847
Steve Corey, the curator, was at a book fair in San Francisco, was able to purchase the collection of a bibliographies, a collection of objectives, at a price of $10,000.

32:20.330 --> 32:22.513
But we were able to move in that quickly.

32:22.813 --> 32:25.957
The lady who gave the lecture said, I'm amazed and thrilled.

32:26.417 --> 32:31.523
I just can't speak enough of your institution, because we moved quickly to add some substance to it.

32:31.764 --> 32:34.767
So we don't put it up and lock it up and say, thanks very much, goodbye.

32:35.523 --> 32:41.370
You are kind of, well, let's talk a little bit more about Strauss, because I really think I have to know.

32:41.651 --> 32:44.975
I heard a story from Sandy Berger yesterday, and he told me to check it out through you.

32:45.535 --> 32:53.826
But I heard that he and another fellow, one was collecting Doves Press, and the other was collecting Kelmscott Press.

32:53.946 --> 32:55.968
And so they decided, listen, why should we compete?

32:56.469 --> 32:57.410
Let's trade.

32:58.031 --> 32:58.852
Is that a true story?

32:58.912 --> 32:59.373
Yes, it is.

32:59.733 --> 32:59.953
It is.

33:00.074 --> 33:00.854
I don't know particularly.

33:00.915 --> 33:02.897
That's a very familiar story to me.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.809
and Sandy would be able to give you more.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.953
Yeah, Sandy did, but he just said to run it by you just to see if you recall anything.

33:07.993 --> 33:11.237
Well, I'll recall it, but I don't recall it specifically.

33:14.301 --> 33:14.821
That's fine.

33:14.841 --> 33:17.304
Well, Norman Strong has many collections.

33:17.324 --> 33:18.506
He still has many collections?

33:18.526 --> 33:19.627
Well, no, not many now.

33:23.091 --> 33:29.239
The man in Maine, who was a pirate, a pirate,

33:29.658 --> 33:30.319
A pirate?

33:30.339 --> 33:34.844
I'm reaching for it, because he would reprint books without any authority.

33:34.924 --> 33:35.605
That's a pirate.

33:35.845 --> 33:41.131
And so, there are many pirate editions, which he's got.

33:41.151 --> 33:41.952
I'm reaching for the name.

33:41.992 --> 33:43.314
I'm sorry, you can't pull out my memory.

33:43.854 --> 33:46.978
But Norman still keeps that.

33:49.401 --> 33:54.747
He's given talks, Norman has given many talks on his very collection.

33:54.787 --> 33:59.412
One of the major things which Norman Stiles did, he met in New York,

34:00.067 --> 34:05.614
the first chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, California Santa Cruz, starting a new campus.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.496
They liked the man very much.

34:07.917 --> 34:11.481
He said, I'm going to give you a collection to be your cornerstone library.

34:11.501 --> 34:15.086
They promised Carlisle, Carlisle collection.

34:15.106 --> 34:22.856
And this is a collection of importance in the beginning, but also he says, I'm going to promise you, I'm going to add to it.

34:22.876 --> 34:25.399
So autograph letters, manuscripts,

34:25.767 --> 34:29.132
It's a major collection at UC.

34:29.373 --> 34:31.556
What, major collection anywhere?

34:31.576 --> 34:32.678
Who can ask that?

34:33.159 --> 34:46.981
What amazes me about this man is that, from what you've told me, it would be very easy for him to give a collection to Harvard or to the Beinecke or to the Firestone of Princeton or Stanford.

34:47.222 --> 34:49.345
But it seems to me he's really trying to help

34:49.645 --> 34:54.271
the emerging collection, that he wants to spread it around a little bit.

34:54.291 --> 34:54.851
Yes, he does.

34:54.871 --> 34:56.273
Is this a fair reading on that?

34:56.313 --> 35:00.358
It's a fair reading, but again, he's a people man, too.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.585
I got to know him, and we had many visits.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.647
I was a house guest in St.

35:07.667 --> 35:07.988
Helena.

35:08.769 --> 35:13.835
Now, let me give you sort of a sidelight on this.

35:14.816 --> 35:19.602
Ellen Schaefer, S-H-A-F-F-E-R.

35:20.510 --> 35:25.717
He's the curator of his museum, the Silverado Museum in St.

35:25.977 --> 35:26.157
Leon.

35:26.638 --> 35:28.360
Oh, he's the Silverado man.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.422
Oh, I'm perfect.

35:29.442 --> 35:31.144
He's the founder of that whole museum.

35:31.805 --> 35:34.909
Now, um, uh, okay.

35:35.009 --> 35:37.733
Now, Ellen Schaefer is the same age as Norman Charles.

35:37.753 --> 35:42.479
The difference is that Ellen Schaefer is alive and running right now.

35:42.659 --> 35:49.268
You know, she's 88, 89, but she's, now, there's been an oral history program

35:49.535 --> 36:03.193
at UC California, and I have recommended, just a matter of a few weeks ago, that Ellen Shearer be interviewed for The Old History, because this will be a source for Hilma Schultz.

36:03.213 --> 36:06.036
She will tell her a lot about Hilma Schultz.

36:06.056 --> 36:18.192
In fact, if you had the time in view of your book and your own time schedule, it would be worth making a point with her to see the Hurricane Lena.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.064
And how far is that?

36:20.584 --> 36:25.249
Well, it's the driving time about an hour and a half maximum.

36:26.090 --> 36:26.490
Okay.

36:26.510 --> 36:27.511
I'm leaving Sunday.

36:27.531 --> 36:28.753
Do you think I could talk to her tomorrow?

36:28.773 --> 36:30.554
Well, it's possible.

36:31.135 --> 36:32.396
You can telephone.

36:32.416 --> 36:34.558
But it's more important that you know of her.

36:34.618 --> 36:35.179
Okay.

36:35.219 --> 36:38.603
Well, I'd like to talk to her, too, but I could probably talk to you.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.825
I'm going to call her today.

36:40.905 --> 36:41.025
Okay.

36:41.045 --> 36:44.408
Ruth will get you the telephone number.

36:44.428 --> 36:47.892
When I say Dr. Milner-Strauss,

36:48.563 --> 37:06.800
Um, uh, the, um, the Scottish BBC for Broadcasting Company came out to Silver Art Museum and did a story, a film story, a cassette, a video cassette on his, his museum.

37:06.820 --> 37:07.521
Is that available?

37:07.581 --> 37:13.186
Sure it is, but it's available from, from, from, uh, from, uh, from Alan Shaker.

37:13.226 --> 37:17.170
See, if you really contact her, in the sense of person to person,

37:17.521 --> 37:21.506
then you can ask her questions by telephone from time to time.

37:21.586 --> 37:23.308
Oh, no question, but I'd like to see it, too.

37:23.528 --> 37:24.289
Yes, you should see it.

37:24.629 --> 37:28.814
But anyhow, that would be a good visual to see.

37:30.816 --> 37:41.348
So I would say that the Beinecke had a Stevenson election, and I think today there's nothing to match the Stevenson election that Norma Strauss had won.

37:42.349 --> 37:46.414
This is a man who is an exemplar of the

37:46.647 --> 37:53.874
public trust of collectors, meaning that they think they owe something to the community, the learning community.

37:53.894 --> 38:06.627
To me, you can share this with me, that you and I, citizens of any country, can go anywhere in the world and use these items with no cost, although very low cost.

38:06.647 --> 38:10.071
So, the riches of humanity are available for us to study.

38:10.471 --> 38:12.133
Isn't that marvelous?

38:12.153 --> 38:13.814
And museums, too.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.456
I mean, no part of the museum.

38:15.773 --> 38:34.653
I did symposium on Egypt, and I would never have gotten my feeling and my passion without seeing the Metropolitan Museum after they had doubled the galleries at the Metropolitan Museum.

38:34.673 --> 38:37.076
Anyway, I'm talking in your terms, my terms.

38:37.717 --> 38:43.603
The collectors whom I've known have this passion for the future of the population.

38:44.107 --> 38:45.869
Let's talk a little bit about your passion.

38:47.251 --> 39:06.798
It is kind of contradictory, paradoxical, not contradictory, it's almost paradoxical that a man who's been a Jesuit all his life, taken sworn vows of poverty, should have the spark to acquire great and exquisite greatness.

39:07.118 --> 39:12.966
Tell me a little bit about this and how you knew, I've read someplace that you knew from the very beginning,

39:13.148 --> 39:15.450
that your mission in life is to build a library.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.432
Well, that's what Kevin Starr said.

39:18.913 --> 39:20.995
Was that a fair quote?

39:21.015 --> 39:23.077
A quote of Kevin Starr about me.

39:25.540 --> 39:41.755
I would say that my emergence or my passion for books, I would say emergence to my own consciousness, because it was there without me being aware of it, was looking at the Thomas More Library,

39:42.072 --> 39:44.855
in 1951 at the booksellers' shop.

39:46.217 --> 39:52.545
And he said, Bill, I think you should see this and take a look at it.

39:52.565 --> 39:58.172
And I said, I began to look through things, and I went on fire.

39:58.192 --> 40:07.824
The quality of books I saw there by John Dunn's annotated copy of Utopia.

40:07.844 --> 40:08.805
Isn't that fantastic?

40:09.612 --> 40:11.474
with both pencil and ink.

40:11.494 --> 40:14.017
Now, again, because I know collectors... You have that out here?

40:14.277 --> 40:14.598
Yes.

40:14.618 --> 40:15.058
Want to see it?

40:15.078 --> 40:16.280
Yeah, I'd love to.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.062
I bet I would love this one.

40:19.683 --> 40:27.112
So you just said, because you were... Because I was acquainted with a man whom you probably know of the British Library.

40:27.733 --> 40:31.997
He's one of the spokesmen for... He's the editor of... Nicholas Barker.

40:32.017 --> 40:32.618
Nicholas Barker, thank you.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.719
I interviewed him twice already.

40:33.739 --> 40:34.040
You did?

40:34.300 --> 40:38.725
Well, he looked at this book as... He's a kind of a fellow...

40:39.127 --> 40:50.104
charming fellow who, a lot of people were sitting around here, who had to sit by himself and examine this, and he had a great concentration, and people would be talking with him, and he paid no attention to this.

40:50.124 --> 40:59.518
But he said to me, now, he said, I want you to notice that these pencil marks are also John Donne's, but there's martial annotations here.

40:59.879 --> 41:01.561
Look at the condition of this.

41:01.581 --> 41:01.882
Beautiful.

41:03.384 --> 41:06.910
Is that the original binding, do you think, or it must have been rebounded some point?

41:06.930 --> 41:07.851
Rebounded, it was rebounded some point.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.890
It's a nice old binding.

41:12.052 --> 41:18.119
One of our faculty wrote an article on the annotations in the margin of John Donne.

41:18.139 --> 41:23.605
We're looking for some ink annotations by John Donne.

41:23.625 --> 41:28.110
But they add substantially to the knowledge of John Donne's mind.

41:28.130 --> 41:35.639
See, he's on the feminine side of Moore Lyon, so he's a descendant of Thomas More.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.462
Is this a first edition, by the way?

41:38.915 --> 41:41.798
No, it's not any important.

41:41.818 --> 41:43.740
Well, it's an early edition, certainly.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.161
It's 1560.

41:44.181 --> 41:47.705
Yeah, it's an early edition, but by no means is it the first edition.

41:48.286 --> 41:50.428
But it's the association of it.

41:50.568 --> 41:53.031
Now, here, these are marginal allocations.

41:53.191 --> 41:57.996
Marginal allocations of John Donne.

41:59.198 --> 42:00.880
These are in 10.

42:00.900 --> 42:01.080
Oh, yeah.

42:02.401 --> 42:05.124
Crisis of the King's Prerogatives.

42:05.665 --> 42:07.487
And Nicholas was going through this.

42:09.256 --> 42:13.582
Oh, yeah.

42:13.602 --> 42:14.844
1563 is the date on it.

42:14.965 --> 42:22.275
I'm going to place this back in your hands, Father.

42:22.295 --> 42:28.505
The article by one of our friends, John Gleason, A Glimpse from Marginalia.

42:29.226 --> 42:38.740
Dr. Dunn and the Ports of Kings, colon, A Glimpse from Marginalia by John B. Gleason, published by the Journal of English and Germanic.

42:39.395 --> 42:45.460
Philology at the University of Illinois Press, October 1970, number four.

42:46.401 --> 42:47.922
But, okay, I'll check it out.

42:50.525 --> 42:54.668
Well, anyhow, these are examples of things that I saw in booksellers' shop.

42:55.629 --> 43:06.438
And then I saw a manuscript, an early 17th century manuscript of the life of Thomas More, which I could show you as well.

43:06.538 --> 43:08.440
Then also,

43:08.757 --> 43:10.419
There's so many things exciting me about it.

43:11.060 --> 43:18.449
And I said to Dave McGee, that's M-A-G-E-E, M-A-G-E-E.

43:18.469 --> 43:20.872
I said, Dave, how much time do I have?

43:21.333 --> 43:22.194
He said, how much do you want?

43:23.075 --> 43:24.016
I said, a week.

43:24.036 --> 43:25.879
Oh, you have a week.

43:25.899 --> 43:28.142
So as I was already told, he went to my mother and father.

43:28.162 --> 43:31.546
He said, I want to borrow $8,000.

43:31.566 --> 43:32.327
To your mother and father?

43:32.347 --> 43:33.268
Mother and father.

43:33.288 --> 43:35.992
They died in the 1950s, in 1951.

43:36.692 --> 43:37.954
So I said to him,

43:38.356 --> 43:39.798
I'd like to borrow $8,000.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.260
I'd pay you back $1,000 a year.

43:42.201 --> 43:49.630
And they went in the huddle and talked to my brother and sister, and said, we won't lend it to you.

43:49.650 --> 43:51.052
We'll get it to you.

43:51.072 --> 43:52.053
That's a nice story.

43:52.214 --> 43:54.677
This became a cornerstone of our collection.

43:54.697 --> 43:59.283
So the Thomas More Library, the Thomas More Collection, they took a medal.

44:00.264 --> 44:01.746
That's a wonderful story.

44:01.946 --> 44:03.688
Warren Howell.

44:03.708 --> 44:04.249
Warren Howell.

44:04.269 --> 44:05.951
You know that name, Warren Howell?

44:06.091 --> 44:06.692
Oh, indeed.

44:07.516 --> 44:13.102
So when I used the word Saint Thomas More, he said, what are you talking about?

44:13.122 --> 44:15.104
So anyhow, I said, okay, Sir Thomas More.

44:15.345 --> 44:17.207
That's more universal.

44:17.787 --> 44:20.691
But Warren and I became very close friends.

44:22.192 --> 44:23.654
That's how it surfaced.

44:23.674 --> 44:29.680
I knew I had it inside of me because I was never a collector in my earlier years.

44:31.382 --> 44:37.489
But I responded to quality of ancient books and a condition

44:38.245 --> 44:45.476
Dave William McGee would tell our students, our Bing Maher students, to see them, they would say, condition is everything.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.860
You can have a magnificent book and lousy condition.

44:47.880 --> 44:48.420
What is it?

44:48.901 --> 44:52.547
But look at this, something you would enjoy holding.

44:52.867 --> 44:55.070
This is a 16th century book.

44:55.130 --> 44:57.754
It's a delight to hold it and look at it and study it.

44:58.616 --> 45:01.480
Now, again, that's a book you'd take in any condition, though.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.443
But you would restore it.

45:03.693 --> 45:12.564
This is the obligation we all have in your own household or in your library to keep it up, keep it in good condition.

45:13.184 --> 45:22.456
So to continue on with the passion that I have, I wanted library equality.

45:23.096 --> 45:30.966
I was at the Honnold Library in Cromont, H-O-N-N-O-L-D, Honnold Library in Cromont, which is the central library for the Cromont Colleges.

45:31.672 --> 45:41.561
And Dave Davies, D-A-V-I-E-S, was then the director of the Hall of Library, and a very close friend of mine.

45:41.581 --> 45:49.868
When I saw the quality of his collection on the stack, open stacks, I said, that's what I want to do.

45:50.628 --> 45:58.936
So I would say, as far as I'm responding to exemplars for myself and for models, so I want to have quality.

45:58.956 --> 46:01.678
So when I look at our stacks,

46:01.945 --> 46:08.592
I want people to see substantial stuff to work on right now.

46:08.612 --> 46:15.519
So, granted, you take a chance to lose some things, you have lost things, but the purpose is it's open to the public.

46:15.859 --> 46:20.324
And if you're open to the public, you take chances.

46:20.344 --> 46:26.951
But anyhow, that's my passion to make available.

46:27.451 --> 46:31.075
And the other thing was, another passion was,

46:31.730 --> 46:32.411
knowledge.

46:33.252 --> 46:34.193
You have to know.

46:35.355 --> 46:39.180
What good does it go to a bookstore and say, I'm going to buy this book?

46:39.501 --> 46:46.310
As you know and I know, you have to be aware of the importance of the book, and at least have the nose for it.

46:46.370 --> 46:47.632
This may be an important book.

46:47.932 --> 46:51.457
Then go back and check it for your book to read the article.

46:51.477 --> 46:59.408
I was at Oberlin College in 1960, and the retired librarian, I wrote in Kessner, Cleveland,

46:59.725 --> 47:05.193
I said to him, what advice do you have for a younger man than a librarian?

47:05.213 --> 47:09.539
He said, my advice is bibliography, bibliography, bibliography.

47:09.559 --> 47:11.982
And that is so basic.

47:12.002 --> 47:16.188
So you're spending life in the study of sources.

47:16.208 --> 47:22.276
Because you and I know I cannot order in technology by the way to check it out.

47:22.597 --> 47:25.201
I can order in apps by way to check it out.

47:25.221 --> 47:27.724
So I have purchased books in every field.

47:28.295 --> 47:39.850
In fact, they say, well, a Catholic case with lowercase c. So I would say I'm a passionate man, I would say that.

47:40.310 --> 47:50.303
And booksellers I've known and people that I've been inspired by are passionate people, too, meaning they just love it, love what they're doing.

47:51.987 --> 47:57.274
So hopefully that will give you some effort of answering your question.

47:57.314 --> 48:08.509
So tell me, but still, this is a Jesuit school, I gather, and your means, as you pointed out, are not as great as, say, the Beinecke's or the HRC of Texas.

48:09.150 --> 48:12.093
You've had to learn the craft of friendly persuasion, didn't you?

48:12.113 --> 48:13.455
Yes, yes.

48:13.655 --> 48:19.223
And, I mean, this story that you mentioned, the Kevin Starr story, they called you the penniless Medici of San Francisco.

48:19.243 --> 48:19.463
Yeah, yeah.

48:19.814 --> 48:25.262
kind of a newsy headline, I guess, but how do you respond to being so described?

48:25.703 --> 48:40.045
Well, I felt I needed to get out to people who had resources to help us, and when I was taken out of head librarian's job in 1964, I was in 17 years.

48:41.667 --> 48:48.538
I knew I had to have the support of the community, so I began the symposia.

48:48.991 --> 48:55.059
In 1965, that was the year after I began into public relations, formerly.

48:55.079 --> 48:58.764
I've always been doing public relations, but I had a different hat as a librarian.

48:58.964 --> 49:04.432
Now I was a PR man called Director of Library Relations.

49:04.612 --> 49:12.703
I formed a symposium, which would be a literary artistic symposium, which would attract, my purpose was,

49:13.105 --> 49:20.314
people in the community who support the ballet, the symphony, the opera, and the museum, who support the arts.

49:20.334 --> 49:24.719
And with the help of prominent ladies here, I reached them.

49:26.021 --> 49:28.444
Now, this is not a Roman Catholic thing, not a religious thing.

49:28.604 --> 49:29.746
It's a humanistic program.

49:30.306 --> 49:38.877
I just finished the program on Shakespeare, and I think one of the strongest staffs I've ever had, both lectures and discussions,

49:39.363 --> 49:44.768
individuals ready to get into the battle about Shakespeare on comedy, Shakespeare comedy.

49:44.788 --> 49:49.573
So this is my mark, my identification.

49:50.173 --> 49:57.921
And Ruth is showing you, like, the folders of photographs and so on, which we're doing with that too.

49:58.281 --> 50:03.727
But I did go out after not to try to advertise nationally.

50:04.227 --> 50:09.252
I did, in the Saturday, a review.

50:09.653 --> 50:14.538
And it did me some good, but I'm still struggling with advertising, because I charge a lot of money.

50:14.758 --> 50:16.340
You actually take out advertising?

50:16.360 --> 50:17.581
Yeah, advertising.

50:17.601 --> 50:18.662
And what do you say in these ads?

50:19.483 --> 50:23.106
Well, it would be Freedom of Authority was my first program.

50:23.447 --> 50:28.211
The University of California had the first riots on campus as a student revolt.

50:28.231 --> 50:33.356
And so, I took Freedom of Authority in the 16th century, more than that.

50:33.677 --> 50:39.222
And I had a former director of libraries at MIT as my chairman.

50:40.450 --> 50:49.122
a man from Yale, that's my lecture on it more, a man from France, a lecture on Rasmus, a man from Stanford on Luther.

50:49.643 --> 50:51.325
I went down to Stanford with my announcement.

50:52.307 --> 51:01.820
I said to George Houle, H-O-U-L-E, who was then director of the music department, I said, I want you to do the music for me in this symposium.

51:02.001 --> 51:02.882
I want a total experience.

51:02.942 --> 51:03.883
He said, I want lectures.

51:03.903 --> 51:06.908
I want a total experience for people to have.

51:06.928 --> 51:07.268
So he said,

51:07.737 --> 51:08.278
All right.

51:08.298 --> 51:09.359
I'm looking at your program.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.824
I don't have the time, but it's so good I can't turn it down.

51:12.964 --> 51:17.750
So he joined me, and so we had three dinners for three evenings.

51:18.491 --> 51:37.457
We had the lectures discussed in the day, ending at 2 o'clock, but evening we had Trader Vic's, went down to Sanctuary to the Paul Besson Vineyards, and each time we had music appropriate for that time, with instruments, in fact, some of the instruments of that time.

51:37.994 --> 51:52.817
And then the final one is that the Legion of Honor, one of the major museums in San Francisco, out near the Golden Gate, we had, in the Crystal Room, we had a banquet, the Wild Boar, a formal banquet.

51:53.117 --> 52:05.757
And we had drinks in an adjoining area, a gallery, and had the music appropriate to bring the people in following the Wild Boar into the dining room, and we had a dance

52:06.074 --> 52:14.767
and then finally I got up, and we had a lovely dinner.

52:15.748 --> 52:20.014
So I worked hard, but the program just left my hands straight up.

52:20.595 --> 52:26.163
So I said at the end, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the symposium in the authority, good evening.

52:26.824 --> 52:31.431
And a doctor, MD, got up and said, oh my, I beg to differ with you.

52:31.451 --> 52:32.993
This is not the end, there's the beginning.

52:33.580 --> 52:35.802
So I've been doing it every year since 1965.

52:36.063 --> 52:40.607
Not every year, but most years since 1965, so 25 years ago.

52:41.728 --> 52:48.956
So I've done 23 of them, so next will be 24, and so on.

52:49.236 --> 53:00.448
Do you believe that, I mean, prior to your active interest, there was nothing here, right?

53:00.631 --> 53:08.640
Most of my predecessors in the library management were scholars, were people who were more teachers than anything else.

53:08.660 --> 53:19.231
Then before me was a Jesuit who was a real book collector, and he built up the basic sources in our library, the pre-article runs, the reference books which we needed.

53:19.772 --> 53:27.180
But when I came aboard in 1947, we had about 50,000 volumes, and they were not all in one place.

53:28.281 --> 53:30.604
And so the then president of the university,

53:30.888 --> 53:37.155
responded to my interest on planning a new structure.

53:37.175 --> 53:42.942
So I went across the country to Washington State at Pullman.

53:42.962 --> 53:45.866
In fact, our library is very similar to their book.

53:46.386 --> 53:52.894
Then went to Colorado, to Iowa, all places were planning new structures.

53:52.914 --> 53:56.058
Went to Harvard, to MIT.

53:56.619 --> 53:58.701
MIT, I got a great deal of help at MIT.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.282
and then Princeton.

54:01.302 --> 54:13.336
And so the new idea was the modular library, which means that you can, without keeping the center structure around the elevated toilets, all the rest of the space is usable.

54:13.556 --> 54:15.258
Space take walls, whatever.

54:15.278 --> 54:22.727
So I came back, I presented to the trustees, and they said, okay, and happily, the money became immediately available.

54:22.787 --> 54:27.572
I mean, a million and a quarter right on the barrel, no fundraising necessary.

54:27.632 --> 54:28.253
There it was.

54:28.513 --> 54:29.194
That's great.

54:29.663 --> 54:33.867
So, this building now was completed and dedicated in December 1950.

54:35.048 --> 54:41.234
That's pretty nice.

54:41.714 --> 54:45.818
Today, we are approaching 600,000 blinds.

54:45.918 --> 54:46.959
You started with 50,000.

54:46.979 --> 54:51.143
You added a half a million plus 50.

54:53.726 --> 54:56.008
It's a matter of, again,

54:56.562 --> 55:03.690
I want to say that the library staff and family have done a lot, but I have maybe created an environment to make it move ahead.

55:05.372 --> 55:16.665
Whenever I'm traveling in Cleveland, or in Boston, or Chicago, or New York, or wherever, I go in to see the bookstores.

55:16.685 --> 55:20.850
And I don't depend upon them giving any quotations.

55:21.391 --> 55:23.053
I respond to what I've seen.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.776
And I look for the bottom shelves.

55:26.026 --> 55:31.851
And very often they were not mocked up and said, okay, take it as it is.

55:32.231 --> 55:33.092
Keep that same price.

55:33.833 --> 55:47.685
So I pursued, and I went to Europe in 63, this is the end of my term as head librarian, in 1963, 54, from January to July.

55:48.366 --> 55:52.049
And I probably acquired 10,000 books on that occasion.

55:52.069 --> 55:52.189
Wow.

55:52.590 --> 55:55.392
And including one major library on

55:56.873 --> 56:02.382
foreign history, war, and foreign policy.

56:02.442 --> 56:05.988
So that was a major coup.

56:06.089 --> 56:10.696
And I had good force in meeting people in Belgium.

56:10.717 --> 56:15.985
Now, the prices I paid in 1964 are amazing.

56:17.388 --> 56:20.313
Under ten dollars a book, like five dollars a book.

56:20.533 --> 56:22.797
Very important, ordinary good book.

56:23.114 --> 56:28.681
We would be very happy to pay $35, $40, $50 for the same book."

56:28.701 --> 56:30.723
I'd say, thank you very much for this price.

56:30.843 --> 56:36.290
But they were, in England, $500 book, under one pound.

56:36.510 --> 56:41.056
But that was hard work.

56:41.076 --> 56:45.501
Even with my passion, it was hard work that six months, as far as I was exhausted.

56:45.541 --> 56:46.362
I lost weight.

56:46.382 --> 56:49.746
In six months, you acquired 10,000 books.

56:51.059 --> 56:52.481
And you knew what you were getting.

56:52.681 --> 56:54.223
I mean, tell me about the conviction.

56:55.104 --> 57:05.596
What I do, whenever I—I've always done this, from the European ship on the present day, I never buy anything on the wall.

57:06.497 --> 57:15.768
I get a quotation that was sent down to the library, to the library staff for participation in it.

57:15.788 --> 57:17.370
So, they would say, we already have it.

57:17.806 --> 57:21.331
or we have another edition, or we don't need it, or we don't want it.

57:21.692 --> 57:26.018
So I'm probably a sportsman that I could buy it, and so it's a cooperative thing.

57:26.840 --> 57:30.926
But my nose says this is an important book, and 90% of the time they order it.

57:32.008 --> 57:38.317
So I have the funds, and they buy it.

57:38.377 --> 57:46.750
And just maybe one statement on your conviction of why a university needs not just books, but rare books.

57:47.000 --> 57:57.813
Well, the rare books, it's an unfortunate term, but to a lay person outside of the real world and my world, it's very misleading.

57:58.453 --> 58:05.722
They feel it's going to be something under glass, it's going to be something like a museum thing, which is static, not active.

58:06.603 --> 58:16.855
I consider the materials in this room and in this area are sources of study, and we have had

58:17.206 --> 58:24.973
A number of people come here and do serious work, and they say, I have everything I need to study in this particular subject.

58:25.714 --> 58:31.039
I'd like to quote Sosnitzel at the end of August 1914.

58:31.920 --> 58:35.443
He portrays a woman teacher at a university.

58:35.503 --> 58:36.184
This is in Russia.

58:37.345 --> 58:41.108
And this woman is talking to the girls, students, sophomores.

58:42.109 --> 58:45.272
She says, girls go to the sources.

58:45.944 --> 58:50.171
Otherwise, one shadow box plucked into another shadow box.

58:50.191 --> 59:00.708
Now, that is very strong to me, because we have things here which our factory are not yet connected with.

59:00.848 --> 59:04.754
There is primary source for material here for publications.

59:04.774 --> 59:06.577
So, it's not a museum thing.

59:06.758 --> 59:10.163
We have a nice tsunami, granted, but it's primarily

59:10.463 --> 59:15.187
Well, it's important to show what you have, but basically you have to have the collection.

59:15.207 --> 59:17.369
It's the collection that makes the collection.

59:18.330 --> 59:28.639
But the other thing, fascinating for us, that people would discover things which we didn't realize they had, because this is what an archive, particularly a rare bookman, why?

59:28.659 --> 59:29.820
I didn't know if you had this.

59:30.260 --> 59:38.968
Well, of course, it's our pleasure to know that they recognized certain sources, because a specialist in a special area would say, that is very important.

59:39.168 --> 59:42.091
we know is important, but how important we didn't know.

59:42.331 --> 59:47.837
And the strength, would you just tell me briefly what you think the strength of the collection is, in what areas?

59:48.878 --> 59:49.759
Particularly strong?

59:49.799 --> 59:55.806
Well, in literature, American, English, some French, in art.

59:56.006 --> 01:00:08.820
The history of thought, it's pretty hard for me to say these things without coming down to specific instances.

01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:13.444
This housing collection is not a terribly important collection for research.
