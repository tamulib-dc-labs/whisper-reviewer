00:03.153 --> 00:21.155
You know that when J. Paul Getty, the founder, died in 1976, I believe, he left a great deal of money.

00:22.296 --> 00:29.225
How much money was never really known, even though he was considered the richest man in the world during his lifetime.

00:29.645 --> 00:31.067
But he left an enormous

00:32.617 --> 00:57.898
Invested an enormous amount of money to what was then called the J. Paul Getty Foundation, the sole purpose of which was the care and feeding of the little museum in Malibu that he had founded in the villa, the copy of the Herculaneum Villa that he had built there.

00:58.503 --> 01:12.440
Well, the estate, the Getty estate, was tied up for years in litigation.

01:12.460 --> 01:24.054
There was the children and the girlfriends and all the, you know, there were a number of claims on it and that kind of thing.

01:24.074 --> 01:25.776
And it was a vast amount of money.

01:25.992 --> 01:29.840
And so it took some time until all that was settled.

01:30.001 --> 01:42.027
When it was all settled and everything in place, the trustees of the foundation realized that they had something quite extraordinary on their hands and that it was far too much money.

01:42.310 --> 01:57.195
to be lavished with any sense of responsibility on this museum on the shores of the Pacific.

01:57.215 --> 01:59.619
They did a very intelligent thing.

01:59.639 --> 02:07.592
They reconstituted themselves entirely and they took a lot of time to do it and to study the situation.

02:08.028 --> 02:14.637
They reconstituted themselves from the Getty Foundation to the Getty Trust, as it's now known.

02:14.997 --> 02:18.322
When approximately did they do this, would you say?

02:18.342 --> 02:19.884
Late 70s, early 80s.

02:19.904 --> 02:20.805
I can't remember.

02:20.825 --> 02:23.308
Let's say 1980 to be... So it's the last 10 years.

02:23.328 --> 02:23.669
Oh, yes.

02:24.370 --> 02:27.854
So they became the Getty Trust.

02:28.695 --> 02:35.284
And they took this enormous endowment.

02:35.821 --> 02:50.563
which they had under their control, and gave it different responsibilities and charges than that simply of the care and feeding of the museum.

02:51.064 --> 02:53.187
Can I just interject a question?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.711
Can we say that it was in the hundreds of years?

02:55.731 --> 02:56.192
Is that fair yet?

02:56.358 --> 03:19.851
Oh there's no question that it was in the hundreds of millions uh it was uh it was uh because these are public figures so there's no problem with that. It was somewhere close to uh well I don't even remember now. I mean it's easy enough. You can check it out. I think it was uh I think it was uh

03:20.253 --> 03:48.420
in the area of one and a half a million, uh billion, dollars. B, with a B. Now the managers of the uh of the Getty uh Trust are very accomplished uh people, very intelligent, uh they come from uh financial, corporate uh backgrounds and uh and with the sale of the Getty Oil Company to

03:48.822 --> 03:52.908
Not to Texaco.

03:53.028 --> 04:03.662
That was the cause of the problem.

04:03.682 --> 04:05.004
There was Pennzoil, I think.

04:06.386 --> 04:07.187
Whatever it was.

04:07.207 --> 04:18.002
With the sale of the Getty oil stock which the trust had inherited in, I think, 1984, the trust...

04:18.235 --> 04:28.161
uh came up to uh close to its present figure of almost four billion dollars so uh

04:28.985 --> 04:31.908
I want to say something about that.

04:32.449 --> 04:42.218
Well, I want to say something about that because you're interested in my role as a collection developer, and that, of course, means money.

04:42.779 --> 04:49.846
But I want to say something about this money, but I'm going to come back to it.

04:50.327 --> 04:53.710
Let me just finish the history of this place.

04:55.276 --> 05:14.196
So with this establishing themselves as the Getty Trust, and as I say, they took a lot of time, consulted with a lot of people all over the world about what this trust could do, and what its functions could be, and how it could best use this money.

05:14.952 --> 05:20.762
And what they did was establish a series of entities, as we call them.

05:21.263 --> 05:29.998
The Getty Trust is the mother organization, the umbrella organization for all of the entities.

05:30.018 --> 05:34.986
All of the entities come to it for their funding.

05:34.966 --> 05:47.834
They come to it for the guidelines and the rules concerning all sorts of administrative matters, budgets and personnel and equipment and everything that falls under the head of it.

05:48.456 --> 05:50.400
Do they determine how much money you're going to get?

05:51.342 --> 05:51.422
Yes.

05:51.908 --> 06:05.164
Yes, every year each entity submits a budget, and the trust in its wisdom decides what's appropriate and necessary, and we operate on that budget.

06:06.386 --> 06:09.770
Now, just a little closer.

06:09.950 --> 06:10.050
Sure.

06:10.190 --> 06:10.931
Oh, sorry.

06:10.951 --> 06:19.722
Okay, now, so each of these entities, the oldest and the best known, of course, because of its name is the J. Paul Getty Museum.

06:20.090 --> 06:30.240
And then is the entity with which I'm associated, the J. Paul Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.905
It's a research institution.

06:32.358 --> 07:00.863
And then there are a number of others, the J. Paul Getty Conservation Institute, the J. Paul Getty Art History Information Program, the J. Paul Getty Program for the Study of Art and Film, the Getty Program for Education, Art and Education, and the J. Paul Getty Grant Program.

07:00.843 --> 07:06.189
Could this ever evolve itself into an institutional university?

07:07.870 --> 07:09.292
Yes, it could, but it won't.

07:09.312 --> 07:25.949
We don't feel, or the trust doesn't feel, that it's appropriate to found another university or to become part of another university, all of which was suggested initially.

07:26.850 --> 07:30.394
A university does a different thing into the teaching function.

07:32.095 --> 07:52.761
It means using the money in ways which we feel are already well done by existing institutions.

07:52.781 --> 07:54.183
We don't want to compete with them.

07:54.203 --> 07:57.647
Although we collaborate with many teaching institutions, we don't want to

07:58.623 --> 08:10.675
This is unique to the United States.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.134
Can you say that again?

08:13.154 --> 08:14.176
You're educated in the libraries?

08:14.917 --> 08:15.157
Yes.

08:15.558 --> 08:16.640
That's a good quote.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.160
I like that.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.264
There's no question about it.

08:19.364 --> 08:21.247
I can prove it to you.

08:21.267 --> 08:30.320
I can tell you that I was educated in the library, in the libraries of my native city of Baltimore, and particularly in the public library.

08:30.901 --> 08:37.811
The Enoch Pratt Free Library is, and has been since it began, one of the great public libraries of America.

08:40.195 --> 08:41.016
I...

08:41.468 --> 09:08.202
grew up uh not too far away from that library uh the great central library which is yes great i came from a uh a family uh where

09:08.873 --> 09:16.283
Books in education were of course very important.

09:16.303 --> 09:20.789
Service is not what it should be like.

09:24.273 --> 09:30.882
I spent a large part of my youth, when I wasn't in school,

09:31.688 --> 09:36.092
in the main branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library.

09:37.073 --> 09:38.975
And I can't recall happier days.

09:41.757 --> 09:48.524
I can remember when the library was built right across from the great cathedral in Baltimore.

09:51.186 --> 09:58.253
I remember walking in it and around it with my father.

09:58.756 --> 10:08.285
and he was very proud of the city and had a very good education in the history of the city as a result.

10:09.046 --> 10:27.244
And I remember when the library was being built, I was a little boy, and since my father was a merchant, he was very proud of the fact that the windows of the Enoch Bradfrey Library were, as they still are today,

10:27.832 --> 10:51.662
designed uh for exhibit purposes and they had a lot in common thank you they had a lot in common with the windows of the department stores in baltimore at that time and they were designed deliberately for that reason since enoch

10:52.216 --> 11:15.109
Pratt was himself a merchant, and since the wealth of Baltimore was founded, was based on a lot of merchant wealth, like Pratt, Peabody, and others, the windows were deliberately designed to be like the windows of the department stores.

11:15.189 --> 11:17.953
And in those days, when I was a kid,

11:18.288 --> 11:30.442
Baltimore was filled with wonderful department stores, which were models for those elsewhere in the United States.

11:30.502 --> 11:42.256
There was Hutzlers, and there were Stewers, and there was Hoshio Kohn, and there was Hex, and Landsbergs, and so on, and so on.

11:42.336 --> 11:45.139
And these were

11:46.621 --> 11:55.009
families that also were the supporters of the cultural life of the city.

11:55.429 --> 12:06.859
So I always, from the time I was a child, I had a close feeling of close association with that life.

12:06.879 --> 12:13.645
And my youth was spent in them.

12:13.665 --> 12:15.447
And I remember being

12:15.832 --> 12:45.062
befriended by librarians. I remember that my first drink in public was thanks to a librarian. We lived we lived around the corner from a branch library and the branch librarian was Mrs. Melvin, and of course I remember that because Melvin is my middle name. That's why I'm called Mel.

12:45.447 --> 13:09.312
But Mrs. Melvin was one of those wonderful people who loved books and loved children or I should say loved human beings, and uh she obviously saw a kid when she looked at me who both needed direction and would take it.

13:10.017 --> 13:22.733
And I remember the wonderful afternoons in that library of being, when she would take me under her wing and she would ask me, have I read this?

13:22.773 --> 13:23.534
Have I read that?

13:24.455 --> 13:31.224
And we would insist that when I brought books back, I would tell her what I thought about them.

13:32.906 --> 13:35.890
As a matter of fact, she was teaching, of course.

13:36.123 --> 13:47.054
And I still think that that's one of the principal functions of the best booksellers and the best librarians.

13:47.995 --> 13:51.799
I can even remember being, I can remember a moment in Cusili.

13:51.819 --> 13:52.360
Cusili for me.

13:53.061 --> 13:56.464
There you go.

13:56.484 --> 13:58.066
I'm going to shut this off during lunch.

13:58.086 --> 13:59.928
Yeah, go ahead.

13:59.948 --> 14:02.130
Well, you were saying something earlier.

14:02.583 --> 14:07.835
Like that?

14:08.416 --> 14:09.479
Like that?

14:10.601 --> 14:11.022
Okay.

14:12.105 --> 14:17.858
I had asked you at the beginning of lunch,

14:18.850 --> 14:21.854
I had mentioned that this is unique to the United States.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.957
The Getty Center?

14:24.338 --> 14:24.939
This center?

14:25.199 --> 14:28.964
Yeah, not just unique to Getty, but I think like the Morgan has done a similar thing.

14:29.205 --> 14:30.547
Oh, yes.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.409
But if you don't find this outside of the United States.

14:32.429 --> 14:40.280
No, there are many research institutes in the United States and centers for a study of this, that, or the other.

14:41.162 --> 14:47.811
But the kinds of programs that we have here and the philosophy that guides us

14:48.517 --> 14:52.624
I think make us quite special, if not unique.

14:52.684 --> 14:57.011
I don't know why I have to say unique about anything.

14:57.732 --> 15:05.445
But we are a research center devoted to the history of art and the humanities, as the name indicates.

15:06.927 --> 15:11.875
We interpret the history of art very broadly.

15:12.530 --> 15:26.085
That does set us off from a number of similar institutions, particularly the one that I came from here.

15:26.706 --> 15:29.509
I was at the National Gallery of Art before I came here.

15:29.529 --> 15:41.743
I was chief librarian there for 14 years and had a large part in the formation and development of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.974
at the National Gallery of Art.

15:44.994 --> 15:59.197
The difference between this place and that one and many others, many other research centers where the history of art is the focal aspect is that we interpret the history of art very broadly.

16:02.262 --> 16:09.233
For us, it is important that the history of art be studied

16:09.753 --> 16:18.612
and thought about in terms of its role as part of the history of civilization and history of culture as a whole.

16:19.354 --> 16:28.875
It is not simply the study of art objects

16:29.362 --> 16:40.614
disembodied and separated from the cultures in which they were formed and executed.

16:40.634 --> 16:46.260
So if you have a focus on the history of art, then is that kind of a general umbrella?

16:46.400 --> 16:55.470
Our focus is the history of art, but because of the broad interpretation that we put upon it,

16:55.923 --> 17:21.559
And because we cover so many fields, everything from the ancient world to the contemporary, and in so many places, we really are engaged here, not so much in the history of art, although we never forget that focus of our activity, but we really are engaged here in the history of ideas.

17:23.159 --> 17:26.143
That's right.

17:26.844 --> 17:27.806
That's right.

17:27.826 --> 17:32.893
And so our collections, for which I'm responsible, mirror that point of view.

17:33.634 --> 17:36.879
Where did you find the collections, the manuscript collections?

17:36.899 --> 17:49.978
The collection, our resources, as we've chosen to call them, consist of all of the usual kinds of material that you find everywhere else.

17:50.879 --> 17:51.360
Books,

17:52.370 --> 17:57.677
You cannot study the history of art, after all, without photographs.

17:57.697 --> 17:59.320
That's what the great Panofsky said.

17:59.680 --> 18:11.757
Panofsky defined the history of art as the combination of books and photographs, never to forget the original work of art itself, of course.

18:12.398 --> 18:21.330
But in lieu of being able to stand in front of the original work of art, in order to study it, you have to have a photograph of it, and you have to have literature about it.

18:21.563 --> 18:39.891
So our resources consist of books, photographs, and the mass and mass of documentation of unpublished kinds that exist in every kind of archive or manuscript division.

18:39.911 --> 18:45.199
We have manuscripts, letters, drawings.

18:46.260 --> 18:46.761
You don't care what?

18:47.416 --> 18:48.657
Is it all catalogued?

18:48.677 --> 18:49.859
No, of course not.

18:49.919 --> 18:54.984
If it were all catalogued, there'd be no reason for my being here.

18:55.965 --> 19:15.567
I am always suspicious of libraries that have everything all catalogued, because I wonder what kind of collection development program that they have, what sort of acquisition policy that they have, or what kind of miracle workers their catalogers are, that they are all catalogued.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.629
No, it's not all catalogued.

19:17.729 --> 19:23.237
It's not even all accessible, I regret to say.

19:23.878 --> 19:25.741
But that's the nature of things.

19:25.781 --> 19:31.169
The Getty Center, like the other Getty entities, is young.

19:31.309 --> 19:35.535
It started off with a big bang some two years ago.

19:35.575 --> 19:42.145
There was initially a great deal of money available, and it did what it had to do

19:42.479 --> 19:53.969
initially, in order to create an institution, a brand new institution, in order to assemble its resources.

19:53.989 --> 19:58.193
It did what it had to do, and then it bought large collections en bloc.

19:59.554 --> 20:12.486
And it has continued to do so to a lesser degree, of course, as the amount of duplification increased and as money became less.

20:12.719 --> 20:22.193
But that's the only way to build quickly and well, is to buy material in large quantities.

20:22.213 --> 20:28.382
And, of course, it's also true because of the kinds of material that we're interested in.

20:29.163 --> 20:39.298
Scholars' libraries and dealers' archives and collectors' archives and artists' letters and that sort of thing.

20:39.318 --> 20:42.102
Sure, I mean, if one had all the time in the world

20:42.908 --> 20:53.525
You could buy, much more selectively, one piece here, another piece there.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.431
But we don't have all the time in the world.

20:57.852 --> 21:09.490
And while there may be an occasional piece of nonsense that comes in, on the whole, the quality is very high because

21:10.178 --> 21:13.102
The sources are good ones.

21:14.644 --> 21:19.792
Of course, with manuscripts, there won't be duplication.

21:19.812 --> 21:20.092
No.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.496
With books, of course.

21:22.576 --> 21:24.899
Well, there's a certain amount of duplication.

21:25.460 --> 21:31.910
But with a large institution, you know, there are always duplicates and there are duplicates.

21:31.990 --> 21:37.738
There are many books of which you cannot have too many copies.

21:39.018 --> 22:04.975
Well, for example, if you have the catalogue résumé of important artists and you are running a large research center such as this one, there will always be a number of offices, a number of areas in the institution that will want

22:05.562 --> 22:13.554
the catalogue résonne of the particular artist in, in, in that area office, or, or this.

22:13.794 --> 22:16.338
It's not necessarily a rare book.

22:16.358 --> 22:16.919
That's right.

22:17.460 --> 22:24.590
Now, we do not buy, uh, the rare book, uh, in and for itself.

22:25.372 --> 22:28.837
We are all, at heart, bibliophiles here.

22:30.459 --> 22:35.046
But we do not buy, unlike other places, which,

22:35.296 --> 22:38.880
to their credit are set up to do that.

22:38.900 --> 22:56.601
We do not buy, for purely bibliophilic reasons, we do not buy a particular edition of a book, for example, because it is the rarest edition.

22:56.621 --> 23:00.226
We are interested in information here.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.970
We are interested in materials for research.

23:04.692 --> 23:06.514
resources for scholarship.

23:07.755 --> 23:29.194
And so if the second edition of a book is the fuller one, the more valuable in terms of the information which it contains for scholarship, that's the interest.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.376
That's the edition which interests us.

23:31.396 --> 23:32.877
It really is a significant difference.

23:33.599 --> 23:41.369
That's right.

23:41.429 --> 23:43.191
That's right.

23:43.411 --> 23:47.496
They were collecting exquisitely valuable things.

23:47.977 --> 23:48.257
Right.

23:49.238 --> 23:49.779
Right.

23:49.799 --> 24:00.552
We are, of course, interested in the beautiful book, too, but not to the extent that other institutions are, because we are surrounded

24:00.920 --> 24:09.148
by institutions which have made a significant step in that direction and have done a very, very good job.

24:09.569 --> 24:15.374
And we don't feel that we should either try to duplicate what they do or rival what they do.

24:16.035 --> 24:24.263
And our relationship with our sister and brother institutions in the area are very close and very cooperative.

24:25.224 --> 24:27.366
We make a great effort.

24:27.683 --> 24:38.158
to work with them so that there is no needless duplication and expensive duplication.

24:38.738 --> 24:50.775
And there are a number of areas which we stay away from entirely because the holdings on those subjects are so good in very close areas.

24:50.795 --> 24:53.539
And our relationship with UCLA in particular

24:54.093 --> 25:01.025
is an extremely close one, and that's true not only geographically.

25:01.065 --> 25:15.150
We are approximately five miles from the UCLA campus at the moment, and when we are in our own buildings there on the Brentwood site in a few years, we will be even closer, I think about three miles.

25:15.831 --> 25:19.037
Is that what you're projecting for a couple years?

25:19.405 --> 25:22.229
Oh, I don't know when the move will take place, you know.

25:22.269 --> 25:26.014
I'm just thinking in terms of my book, I'm wondering how it writes this.

25:26.034 --> 25:27.676
It's probably five months.

25:27.696 --> 25:28.758
It's probably five years.

25:28.978 --> 25:32.923
It's probably five years.

25:32.943 --> 25:33.043
Okay.

25:33.444 --> 25:42.056
It is said, I mean, one of the many reasons I hear are certainly because you're a major person in your own right.

25:42.076 --> 25:42.356
Yeah.

25:42.456 --> 25:45.660
But the duty is said to be the main event right now.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.623
I mean, in terms of spending, in terms of acquisitions,

25:47.772 --> 25:48.333
Right.

25:48.353 --> 25:51.077
What's going on now, just as where it's happening?

25:51.097 --> 25:55.164
The Getty, uh— Is that something you would answer, first of all, with a yes-to-no answer?

25:55.184 --> 26:15.096
Well, I don't want to describe our activities as the main event, necessarily, and I want to make sure that the— Yeah, no, I want to make sure— I want to make sure that the— that the clear distinction is made between the Getty Center

26:15.498 --> 26:18.662
and the activities of the Getty Museum.

26:20.664 --> 26:24.829
I certainly would not be here, if you don't find it, if it were.

26:25.089 --> 26:26.331
Yeah, right, right.

26:26.351 --> 26:29.094
The position of a Van Gogh for Indian knowledge.

26:29.174 --> 26:29.754
Yeah, you see.

26:29.774 --> 26:42.349
I mean, and of course it's problematic whether or not the acquisitions of the museum are the main event, too.

26:42.751 --> 26:45.936
Those are arguable matters.

26:45.956 --> 26:49.340
There are a lot of people who are pleased with what the Getty Museum does.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.986
There are some people who are critical of it.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.129
That's neither here nor there.

26:56.270 --> 26:59.915
You understand the distinction between the two places.

27:02.018 --> 27:05.964
We collect on a large scale.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.851
The money, of course, doesn't match what the

27:11.455 --> 27:21.212
Getty Museum spends, the trust, disbursement of its funds is not equal.

27:23.135 --> 27:29.726
Whether it should be is something else, and I'm not prepared at all.

27:29.746 --> 27:31.148
I want to talk about that.

27:31.289 --> 27:34.033
However, let me just interject.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.197
What they might spend on one painting

27:36.869 --> 27:41.137
If you have that amount of money to buy a minister, it's more than anybody else.

27:41.157 --> 27:41.698
Exactly.

27:42.158 --> 27:42.579
Exactly.

27:42.599 --> 27:48.690
And there's no way that we have anything we're close to that, you see.

27:48.810 --> 27:58.287
So, I mean, they're two totally separate institutions with different goals, and they're not to be compared.

27:58.874 --> 28:05.402
The Getty Center's budget, and everybody's always curious about that.

28:06.023 --> 28:10.108
I can't mention, nor would I, if I could, exact figures.

28:10.168 --> 28:11.930
That's confidential information.

28:12.411 --> 28:27.430
We're a semi-public institution, and unlike a certain public one, we don't have to reveal what our

28:27.781 --> 28:29.803
internal budgets are.

28:30.764 --> 28:32.706
The trust issues an annual report.

28:33.486 --> 28:42.415
This is public information, and what's in the annual report is available to everybody who wants to find it, to look at it.

28:43.156 --> 28:56.168
But our budgets, our operating budget and our collection development budget are by any standard

28:56.587 --> 29:03.178
whether relative or absolute standard, very good ones, high ones.

29:03.218 --> 29:07.426
There's no question that by any standard we have a lot of money.

29:08.047 --> 29:17.042
We do not have the infinite amount of money that public opinion credits us with.

29:17.832 --> 29:30.553
We are held to a tight budget and an increasingly tight budget from the trust every year.

29:31.033 --> 29:41.410
There is no special appeal every now and then for something unusually expensive or grand or large.

29:42.082 --> 29:51.398
what the money that is appropriated for us every year is that which we have to deal with, and as I say, it's constantly less.

29:52.059 --> 29:59.251
For all the usual reasons, the Trust has enormous programs throughout the entities.

29:59.271 --> 30:07.785
The cost of the building will be great, and as these things always go, there probably will always be

30:08.170 --> 30:09.671
greater than anticipated.

30:10.292 --> 30:27.328
There are all of the usual outside factors that have to do with the fluctuation of the value of the dollar, recession or not recession, inflation or not inflation, the ups and downs of the stock market, and so on.

30:28.049 --> 30:37.418
So we don't have the ability that a lot of people credit us with being able to do

30:38.157 --> 30:39.359
almost anything.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.004
And I'm glad we don't have such an ability.

30:43.465 --> 30:56.984
I don't want to deny for a minute that we have by, as I say, either absolute or relative standards, a great deal more money than most other institutions.

30:57.004 --> 30:57.705
That's true.

30:58.346 --> 31:06.578
But in addition to what I've already said, I want to point out that that money has to cover an enormous area

31:06.845 --> 31:14.411
for collection development, as well as many programs.

31:14.431 --> 31:18.755
And I'm speaking just within the Getty Center, the Search Center.

31:20.196 --> 31:25.721
And the same thing is true for all the Getty entities.

31:26.662 --> 31:36.430
We cover, as I mentioned to you before, a broad range of art historically related subjects.

31:36.865 --> 31:43.631
from the ancient world to the contemporary ones.

31:44.953 --> 32:05.792
We have dedicated areas for research for which collecting is an expensive proposition.

32:06.194 --> 32:25.232
in an attempt to be conscientious and as complete as possible in those areas, we find that the budget that we have is fairly adequate.

32:26.674 --> 32:30.717
What you're saying is really at no great moment.

32:30.738 --> 32:30.958
No.

32:32.199 --> 32:35.442
It's a considerable amount of money to go question about that, and that's fine.

32:35.759 --> 32:48.891
I think what I'm particularly interested in is that you are now in a very enviable position of having the opportunity, you and Edelstein, to create a great collection.

32:48.911 --> 32:49.071
Exactly.

32:49.091 --> 32:50.432
And the means with which to do it.

32:50.492 --> 32:50.952
Right.

32:50.972 --> 32:54.516
And the mandate, apparently, to decide where to go out and get.

32:54.536 --> 32:54.756
Right.

32:54.776 --> 32:57.939
And maybe we just thought, you know, I'm kind of interested in this.

32:58.079 --> 32:58.219
Right.

32:58.239 --> 33:03.884
Yeah, no, I, uh, I agree, and it is an enviable position to be in.

33:03.904 --> 33:05.125
I feel very fortunate.

33:05.543 --> 33:11.490
at this stage of my life and my career to have this kind of job.

33:11.510 --> 33:18.938
In a way, it's the sort of job that I have been, in a sense, preparing myself for all my life.

33:19.779 --> 33:34.656
I've had the interesting and good fortune to work for a number of institutions at crucial stages in their histories when

33:34.906 --> 33:58.862
when the growth of the collections was at a time when the growth of the collections was an important factor for those institutions, and when I had the opportunity to play a part in the growth of those collections.

33:59.583 --> 34:03.529
I mean, after all, I was at UCLA in the 1960s.

34:05.213 --> 34:22.297
before Ronald Reagan stamped finish to the growth of the education in California, and then later on in the United States.

34:24.020 --> 34:35.035
But to be at the University of California at Los Angeles, UCLA, in the early

34:35.538 --> 35:05.140
in the middle 60s when Bob Vosper was still librarian, when Larry Powell's magic touch was still apparent throughout the university, particularly the libraries, when Franklin Murphy was chancellor, when there was a sympathetic and receptive Board of Regents

35:05.828 --> 35:19.441
governing the university, and to build some of the great collections that exist at UCLA was very nice.

35:20.262 --> 35:31.713
Those were sweet, good days, exciting ones, and I, along with everybody else who was part of the team, had a terrific sense of accomplishment.

35:33.155 --> 35:34.536
For a very brief time,

35:34.972 --> 35:50.709
I was at NYU, New York University, when it had just acquired the Fails Collection, when it was the initial stages of the planning for the Philip Johnson Building on Washington Square.

35:50.749 --> 36:00.840
And for a very brief time, there was at least the promise of exciting creative opportunities there.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.624
It didn't work out.

36:04.942 --> 36:34.442
for many, many reasons, but mostly it was because the university was truly not interested in that aspect of its future, and it didn't have enough of the right people to push the program through, and I was lucky enough to be able to get out of there quickly and get back to California.

36:34.928 --> 37:02.505
Then for a long time, I was with the National Gallery of Art in Washington when the National Gallery of Art, in anticipation of the founding of the Center for Advanced Study and the Visual Art, was interested in building a world-class library for the study of the history of art.

37:03.413 --> 37:06.337
And I was given that charge.

37:06.497 --> 37:12.344
I said, okay, here's where you sit.

37:13.986 --> 37:14.527
Go to it.

37:15.708 --> 37:33.049
And now I'm at the Getty Center with an even broader and more interesting charge, and I feel

37:33.822 --> 38:03.778
working with fascinating, interesting, bright people who have stimulating ideas, where one, for the most part, naturally there will always be intrusions on various bureaucratic necessities, but for the most part, where one can actually

38:04.248 --> 38:32.213
live in a community where ideas and books and scholarship are the most important things and where we can see progress being made on a daily basis.

38:32.497 --> 38:57.795
Well, that's a very good question, because—that's a very good question, because I am not—I believe in an active, in being an active,

38:59.547 --> 39:09.620
I don't really like that phrase, but for another waste time trying to find a better one, it will do.

39:10.782 --> 39:24.340
A lot of collection development is done in libraries, we all know of them, in which of a passive nature.

39:24.826 --> 39:26.208
by very, very good people.

39:26.348 --> 39:31.895
This is no reflection on the people at all, on the people who do this kind of work.

39:32.336 --> 39:53.162
But it's passive in the sense that the person doing it is a good bookman, knows his stuff, and when he sees a good book in a catalog, or a list, or an offer, whatever form it may take,

39:53.699 --> 40:09.340
is well able to recognize that this is a worthwhile book or a worthwhile piece of paper or whatever it may be, and that it has a place in the collection that's being formed.

40:11.563 --> 40:12.365
That's fine.

40:12.585 --> 40:22.238
That has to be done, and one needs to be a person or needs to have people around who are capable of knowing and collection well,

40:22.623 --> 40:33.277
and recognizing what belongs in it, and taking advantage of opportunities that present themselves.

40:35.480 --> 40:47.876
I like to see collection development proceed on yet another level, and that is a more active one.

40:49.678 --> 40:51.060
I think the best

40:51.462 --> 41:19.444
kind of collection development exists when the person responsible for it, either alone or preferably with colleagues in the same institution, people who have the same goal, the same mission, get together and say or think about an area of thought or an area of scholarship which needs some work.

41:19.897 --> 41:46.866
who promote, in a sense, an area to be developed, even a point of view to be taken about certain kind of work, and go out and attempt to find the kind of the material that belongs

41:47.437 --> 42:13.140
in that field and try to do something about it let me give you a let me try to be a little bit more specific for example we have here at the getty center a really remarkable holding uh concerning all of the 20th century art and literary movements and really spectacular

42:13.593 --> 42:15.775
Holdings among the best in America.

42:15.875 --> 42:17.256
I'm very proud of them.

42:17.276 --> 42:25.704
I'm very proud of the role that I've been able to play in developing some of them.

42:27.025 --> 42:33.410
Now, I mean all of the ones that everybody else means by the same subject.

42:33.470 --> 42:42.418
Our holdings on Dada, on Surrealism, on Italian Futurism, German Expressionism, Russian Constructivism are remarkable.

42:43.495 --> 42:59.518
I mean, truly, truly remarkable in all formats, incidentally, books, manuscripts, photographs, unpublished material, all kinds of material.

42:59.538 --> 43:11.275
Now, I suppose one could take great pride in this, and also take great pride in the fact that it

43:11.575 --> 43:12.536
heavily used.

43:13.878 --> 43:17.122
We have people constantly using this material.

43:17.142 --> 43:18.203
It's in great demand.

43:18.804 --> 43:25.973
It's in great demand for scholarly work, for exhibitions, for loans, for this and that.

43:27.555 --> 43:32.401
I think it would have been wrong to stop right there.

43:33.503 --> 43:38.629
It would have been wrong to stop right there because an essential element is missing.

43:39.470 --> 43:42.494
And mind you, I'm talking about this kind of institution.

43:42.614 --> 43:52.346
I'm not talking about institutions that have other goals that do things differently.

43:52.366 --> 44:03.199
But given the philosophy under which this institution operates, it would have been wrong to stop with these marvelous collections.

44:04.107 --> 44:09.454
as they were constituted.

44:10.435 --> 44:33.625
And what we have done, with some degree of success, is go out and find the literature on 20th century critical theory, on the late 19th century philosophy, particularly that of Nietzsche.

44:34.297 --> 44:50.758
which underlies an understanding of which is absolutely essential for really grasping what these 20th century movements are all about.

44:51.840 --> 45:04.236
We would have been remiss if we hadn't tried to make some connection with the similar movements

45:04.688 --> 45:17.943
in music if we had just left these to art and literature.

45:18.203 --> 45:27.214
So this is what I mean by an active collection development.

45:27.714 --> 45:28.275
How do you find those?

45:28.976 --> 45:31.118
How do you find these things?

45:31.604 --> 45:41.937
This is the secret of the trade, I suppose, if you can call what I do a trade, and I don't object to that.

45:42.238 --> 45:43.900
Or the secret of the art.

45:44.621 --> 45:47.344
I'm not going to give away all my secrets.

45:47.364 --> 45:53.933
But a certain amount of it is a function, and we have to face facts about these things.

45:54.453 --> 45:56.616
A certain amount of it is a function of age.

45:59.414 --> 46:02.459
Contacts.

46:02.479 --> 46:03.361
Experience.

46:05.184 --> 46:09.070
Interest.

46:09.090 --> 46:10.593
And knowing where things are.

46:10.833 --> 46:11.855
And knowing where things are.

46:11.915 --> 46:22.452
Now, it cannot be denied that here I am, I represent the Getty.

46:22.472 --> 46:24.055
The Getty means money.

46:25.115 --> 46:54.413
means opportunity for the real trade which is out there so there are a lot of things that i don't have to worry about that are going to be offered to me that's good we depend on that i am a i'm a great fan of the of the trade of course trade of course of course of course absolutely

46:55.000 --> 47:00.589
But without the trade, none of us could exist.

47:00.649 --> 47:01.350
We need it.

47:02.832 --> 47:19.838
I mean, I'll never forget my first meetings with the great Lehmann Haupt, Helmut Lehmann Haupt, when he was with H.P.

47:19.858 --> 47:20.379
Krauss.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.944
He'd come around, this wonderful man,

47:24.447 --> 47:26.510
dragging this enormous suitcase.

47:27.351 --> 47:33.579
And he'd open it up and he'd say, there is a book which you are going to buy.

47:33.639 --> 47:36.843
You have to buy it because you don't have it.

47:37.504 --> 47:39.347
And how did he know he didn't have it?

47:39.367 --> 47:47.718
He didn't know he didn't have it because he had gone to the trouble of doing some research.

47:48.299 --> 47:51.703
And most of the time, he was right.

47:52.223 --> 47:55.868
And most of the time, we bought it when it was something we did.

47:55.948 --> 47:58.592
When you were born at this time?

47:58.612 --> 48:01.155
Oh, this was my early days at UCLA.

48:03.018 --> 48:04.821
And that kind of thing is appreciated.

48:04.861 --> 48:21.724
We need, none of us who do what we do could work without the trade, particularly the men and women in the trade who take great pride in placing what they have in the right

48:22.312 --> 48:25.715
spot in the right collection.

48:26.776 --> 48:31.280
I can't say enough good things about the trade.

48:32.020 --> 48:52.217
I think the scholarly, interested booksellers who all of us have known in our lives and careers, and some of whom, thank God, are still with us, are the backbone for collection development.

48:52.737 --> 48:54.499
They're absolutely essential.

48:54.660 --> 48:58.104
Two women I interviewed, Liana Rochtenberg and Natalie Sturge.

48:58.325 --> 48:58.645
Right.

49:00.287 --> 49:01.229
Yeah.

49:01.269 --> 49:03.852
They deal almost exclusively with colleges.

49:03.932 --> 49:04.193
Right.

49:04.313 --> 49:05.114
Exactly.

49:05.154 --> 49:06.556
They're wonderful.

49:06.576 --> 49:12.965
And they will take a small college and create their collection for them.

49:12.985 --> 49:18.492
But you see, but I also believe in going beyond it.

49:19.147 --> 49:43.590
I believe that somebody who is really doing his job does not, as I said before, does not just sit around waiting for the right catalog to come plop on his desk or the trade to make contact with him.

49:44.511 --> 49:45.812
You have to go out.

49:46.349 --> 49:49.654
You have to sometimes stimulate the trade.

49:50.355 --> 49:58.007
You have to be sure that the trade knows what it is that you need, knows what it is that you want.

49:58.968 --> 50:04.337
Make sure that they have your guidelines clear.

50:04.397 --> 50:08.363
And then you have to go beyond the trade.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.486
There are personal contacts.

50:13.310 --> 50:13.791
Your...

50:14.159 --> 50:20.025
And I'm not going to tell you what those are, because that's going to give away too many of them, right?

50:20.506 --> 50:21.467
But I think it's clear.

50:21.487 --> 50:30.936
You've got to act on your ideas and on your instincts.

50:30.957 --> 50:31.097
Okay?

50:31.117 --> 50:33.619
It'll pop when it stops.

50:33.639 --> 50:33.840
All right.

50:34.260 --> 50:34.480
Fine.

50:34.500 --> 50:38.424
This little red light is blinking, but I suppose, yeah.

50:39.706 --> 50:43.930
So I do what everybody else does.

50:44.382 --> 50:46.665
I do a lot of reading.

50:47.607 --> 50:48.729
I follow up.

50:49.289 --> 50:50.010
I meet people.

50:50.071 --> 50:50.992
I go to meetings.

50:55.258 --> 51:02.409
Most of them, like all of them, like all conferences and conventions in one thing or another, they're always most valuable for the personal contact.

51:02.429 --> 51:03.831
You travel the world.

51:04.011 --> 51:04.973
And I travel a lot.

51:05.474 --> 51:07.617
I travel in this particular job.

51:07.717 --> 51:11.723
I travel more than I have ever had done in any job.

51:12.125 --> 51:15.168
And some of it is a great pleasure, and some of it is a burden.

51:16.669 --> 51:18.811
Traveling is tiring.

51:18.831 --> 51:21.274
It keeps you away from your desk.

51:21.674 --> 51:27.359
And the office is a den of horrors when you get back.

51:30.122 --> 51:35.667
But I travel for all the usual reasons.

51:35.747 --> 51:40.832
I go to look at particular offers, look at collections, negotiate for them.

51:41.167 --> 51:43.230
I go to meetings and conferences.

51:43.250 --> 52:09.942
I go sometimes for the value of just sort of showing the flag, sort of being in a place where it's important that I be recognized as a representative of the Getty and to show our interest in a subject or a person or an event or

52:10.293 --> 52:13.377
What should you decide to bid at auction?

52:13.397 --> 52:15.320
I imagine you have your agent.

52:15.340 --> 52:15.640
Yes.

52:15.840 --> 52:23.791
I never go—I mean, I may occasionally go to an auction myself if it's convenient.

52:24.451 --> 52:29.198
I wouldn't necessarily travel to an auction myself, and I never bid myself.

52:32.542 --> 52:37.228
Well, the question of what might happen to the price is one thing.

52:37.647 --> 52:48.178
Although people in the trade are very shrewd about that kind of thing, and they know who we use as our agents.

52:48.779 --> 52:57.088
But the use of an agent for an auction has other extremely important values.

52:57.108 --> 52:59.711
One, I mean, an auction house wants its money right away.

53:00.411 --> 53:02.414
Well, I work for an institution.

53:02.534 --> 53:05.697
I can't carry around blank checks.

53:06.031 --> 53:08.914
and write them off right away.

53:08.994 --> 53:23.168
So an institution has to have an agent who will take care of all of that, who will pay the bill and then bill us and perhaps wait a long time while all the usual institutional delays take place.

53:24.629 --> 53:33.658
We need, like other institutions, somebody whom we can trust who will really verify for us what the option

53:34.010 --> 53:35.732
catalog description means.

53:35.812 --> 53:46.822
You know, there's nothing more debatable than the word fine when it's used to describe condition.

53:47.742 --> 53:55.009
Who will collate the material, who will be responsible for packing and shipping, and will do all of that kind of thing.

53:55.029 --> 53:56.350
They earn their commission.

53:56.470 --> 54:04.017
Indeed, I think that they earn their commission many times over.

54:04.351 --> 54:14.504
And I never resent a proper commission, honestly and reasonably earned, I think.

54:14.885 --> 54:28.623
I'm always happy to pay it, and I think it's proper for the people in the trade to earn the commission that way and more power to them.

54:29.564 --> 54:32.468
That would be later the point .

54:33.241 --> 54:48.404
Well, it's wonderful.

54:48.444 --> 54:52.551
It gives me a great feeling of satisfaction.

54:52.591 --> 54:59.822
It's gratifying.

55:00.477 --> 55:14.492
And I can have that, I can satisfy all my collecting urges, and with somebody else's resources, it's wonderful.

55:15.353 --> 55:25.023
I used to be a collector, but I really don't do it now anymore very much.

55:25.603 --> 55:28.206
Maybe it's because so much of that

55:28.709 --> 55:36.117
urge is taken care of here in the office, but it's more to it than that.

55:38.520 --> 55:43.285
I have a lot of books.

55:43.305 --> 55:55.138
I have a lot of art at home, and I find that it doesn't give me the same pleasure that it used to.

55:55.540 --> 56:03.368
And there are, I've got collections of books which still sit in boxes in which they were packed years ago.

56:03.408 --> 56:06.912
And that seemed wrong to me.

56:07.452 --> 56:10.476
What kind of things did you collect?

56:10.496 --> 56:13.098
Oh, I collected quite a lot of varied things.

56:13.198 --> 56:21.447
I was never, I would, I hesitate to call myself a collector because I was never very systematic about it.

56:21.983 --> 56:26.229
There was something I like, an author I liked, a press I liked.

56:26.249 --> 56:33.279
I would try to get it, try to be as complete as possible, and things in very good condition.

56:33.339 --> 56:39.989
I did have, and I still have, some rather nice collections.

56:40.009 --> 56:51.045
I mean, for example, I have perhaps one of the best collections of the books of Wallace Stevens that

56:51.650 --> 57:05.286
If anyone has, that I know of, the best collection, of course, is at the Huntington Library because they bought the Stevens archive from his daughter some years ago.

57:06.307 --> 57:20.323
I know it's somewhat instrumental in that because my connection with Stevens has been close over the years, and I did the Wallace Stevens bibliography that appeared in the University of Pittsburgh bibliography series.

57:21.248 --> 57:23.900
uh, some years ago.

57:24.704 --> 57:27.175
Pardon me.
