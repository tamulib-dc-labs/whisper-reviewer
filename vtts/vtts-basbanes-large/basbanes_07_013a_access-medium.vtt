00:02.073 --> 00:03.655
There's incunabula Americana.

00:03.715 --> 00:13.628
Now, incunabula Americana, if you ask someone what that means, or to define it basically, what I'm saying is books printed in English-speaking America before 1701.

00:13.648 --> 00:23.141
In other words, the first century of printing, 1640 to 1700, is an American incunable.

00:23.161 --> 00:31.472
And incunable, for example, was before 1600, 1540 to 1600.

00:33.005 --> 00:39.813
Books were printed before 1600 in Peru and in Mexico.

00:39.833 --> 00:43.357
1584 in Peru and 1540 or so in Mexico.

00:46.641 --> 00:53.349
The first book printed, of course, in the United States was the Baysan book, 1640 or 1639.

00:53.890 --> 01:02.100
And again, there's a neat area of a universe, which is...

01:02.941 --> 01:09.570
If you're looking at material printed before 1700, it fits very nicely.

01:09.610 --> 01:21.686
Now I have simply because, as an example, one of the areas that are in its ascendancy is American bindings.

01:22.227 --> 01:32.340
Again, America, unashamedly, it's a wonderful area to collect because I have very great feelings about nationalism and nation states.

01:32.894 --> 01:34.575
I think that they are basically good.

01:34.595 --> 01:45.125
I think that they are basically, toward the human condition in human society, net benefits, certainly in the last 400 or 500 years.

01:46.266 --> 01:56.555
And as far as the society that I live in and that I'm part of, I find that it's very easy for me to focus on and collect Americana.

01:56.575 --> 02:02.580
And my definition, or those aspects of Americana, are things essentially done here.

02:04.906 --> 02:15.497
in accumulating the material that I accumulated as an example or as an offshoot of American imprints, early American imprints.

02:15.517 --> 02:23.225
Now, I have simply the largest holding of 17th century American imprints around.

02:23.785 --> 02:32.274
Now, Scheide may have a much more important holding, much more valuable holding, but comprehensively, I got more.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.356
In collecting that material,

02:35.281 --> 02:46.533
I have about, I would say, upwards of 40 or 45 bindings, or books in original bindings, in 17th century bindings.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.016
Jesus Christ, that's 300 years old.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.578
Okay.

02:50.598 --> 03:00.548
It turns out that when I spoke with Wilman Spahn in Bryn Mawr about bindings, I sat at him and I said, Wilman, listen, what do you know about 17th century bindings?

03:01.189 --> 03:02.190
I said, who's got what?

03:02.210 --> 03:03.972
He says, well, he says,

03:04.559 --> 03:12.187
You know, most of the big institutions, Harvard, AAS, Mass Historical, the Republic, they all got about the same.

03:12.367 --> 03:17.752
The only one that's got more is University of Virginia because they have the William Gwynn Mather collection.

03:17.772 --> 03:19.414
I said, well, what are you talking about numbers?

03:20.275 --> 03:25.860
He says, well, everyone's got about 40, but Virginia's got more than 50.

03:26.481 --> 03:27.762
I probably have 40 to 50.

03:27.923 --> 03:28.783
I certainly have 45.

03:29.684 --> 03:33.368
So that what I'm saying is the reason- You have an interesting collection notice at Edward Wolfe.

03:34.141 --> 03:35.863
but not of 17th century stuff.

03:35.923 --> 03:38.787
And Edward's got the collection on plaque bindings, which I show you.

03:38.807 --> 03:39.467
I have a lot of also.

03:39.488 --> 03:40.789
He's doing a book on it.

03:40.809 --> 03:49.720
But again, my collection of bindings, my American binding collection, is a first-rate collection.

03:50.641 --> 03:51.042
It's excellent.

03:51.602 --> 03:57.690
But it is not so much a collection yet as it has been, let's say, an informed accumulation.

03:58.150 --> 03:58.971
I was interested.

03:59.111 --> 03:59.592
I bought.

03:59.926 --> 04:02.971
I bought with a reasonably experienced eye.

04:02.991 --> 04:05.655
Well, that sounds like it ought to be in an institution then.

04:07.037 --> 04:10.563
The binding collection or aspects of it should be, eventually.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.845
But that's my pleasure now.

04:12.005 --> 04:13.388
That's why you're clapping.

04:13.668 --> 04:14.670
Well, I asked Forzheimer.

04:14.690 --> 04:16.753
I said, you know, he said, everything's going to Yale.

04:17.594 --> 04:21.179
and everything, the Mollier collection.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.303
They lost after his father's Mollier collection.

04:24.323 --> 04:29.609
His intelligence collection, as far as they're concerned, they throw that away, but they really want the Mollier.

04:29.629 --> 04:31.652
He said, they're taking this to get the Mollier.

04:32.253 --> 04:41.104
I said, well, I'm speaking very euphemistically, but I said, well, are you going to oversee the transfer of materials

04:41.658 --> 04:44.521
He said, no, he said, when I die, they're going to come and get him.

04:44.541 --> 04:46.682
He said, I'm going to enjoy it.

04:46.702 --> 04:47.263
I'm a collector.

04:47.283 --> 04:50.085
He said, I will enjoy this until I die.

04:50.105 --> 04:52.347
And he says, that's their problem.

04:52.708 --> 04:58.413
I once saw an interview of Charlie Finley once on television.

04:58.433 --> 05:03.137
And they said to him, they said, Mr. Finley, what does your middle initial O stand for?

05:03.157 --> 05:04.538
He says, O stands for owner.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.000
I never forgot that.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.943
You know, when Finley was fighting with Bowie Kuhn,

05:10.565 --> 05:15.870
You know, when he wanted to transfer the A's from Oakland, I sent him $100 for his legal defense fund.

05:15.890 --> 05:18.192
I was involved in this huge lawsuit with Caterpillar.

05:18.573 --> 05:21.015
And I knew what the hell, you know, they were getting there.

05:21.035 --> 05:21.936
He sent it back to me.

05:21.996 --> 05:24.759
It was a very lovely guy.

05:24.779 --> 05:26.961
Yeah, I threw it out.

05:27.361 --> 05:39.033
But the thing is that in the area of my collecting, for example, my bindings, my 19th century binding collection is lovely.

05:39.293 --> 05:39.373
It's

05:39.674 --> 05:40.235
It's beautiful.

05:40.335 --> 05:41.637
It's everything you want it to be.

05:42.879 --> 05:44.421
My 19th century.

05:44.521 --> 05:48.767
My 18th century collection is probably equally formidable.

05:48.787 --> 05:57.600
But my 17th century collection, simply from the point of a historic point in time, here we're dealing with absolute rarities.

05:58.161 --> 06:00.685
I have 50 books that have the original.

06:00.705 --> 06:01.826
Yeah, I'll show them all here.

06:01.846 --> 06:05.091
I have 50 books with the original Bynes on them.

06:06.370 --> 06:09.114
That's all the AIS got, or Harvard, or anyone else.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.297
That's important to note.

06:11.797 --> 06:20.890
It's important to note, and it's important to recognize, from my point of view, on a nonjudgmental basis.

06:21.190 --> 06:27.859
You don't have to impute a qualitative analysis to the binding.

06:27.899 --> 06:29.121
Suffice to say,

06:29.557 --> 06:31.459
that these things exist.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.662
They are iconographic in nature.

06:34.423 --> 06:36.706
They exist.

06:37.387 --> 06:39.249
They don't have to be wonderful or anything.

06:39.269 --> 06:49.702
Other people, I mean, from my point of view, what I'm trying to say is this is if you want to get into the... You know, quality is quite irrelevant.

06:49.803 --> 06:55.750
In this case, it's not that quality is irrelevant, but it is...

06:57.113 --> 07:00.218
not a function of what I'm doing.

07:00.238 --> 07:01.700
Others can look at this book.

07:01.720 --> 07:09.972
In other words, the purpose that I see my collection is serving is I have accumulated these things to me.

07:11.013 --> 07:20.467
You, as an expert, and I'm not an expert, and you may want to see, and I'm not saying you, someone else, may want to look at this and say, look at all these wonderful things about him.

07:21.348 --> 07:25.855
The importance of what I'm doing is I got him so they can see him.

07:26.408 --> 07:28.110
Nothing more, nothing less.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.652
But they're here.

07:29.812 --> 07:30.493
No, no, no.

07:30.993 --> 07:31.975
First of all, they're here.

07:32.595 --> 07:38.402
Secondly, those that need to know... Like I said, it's like a CIA safe house.

07:38.522 --> 07:41.206
Yeah, but those that need to know, know they're here.

07:41.306 --> 07:42.047
They're available.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.228
You want them, I'll mail them to you.

07:44.029 --> 07:47.213
I have no... I'm not troubled by that.

07:47.834 --> 07:53.260
If someone wanted to do a study... If there was a scholar wanting to do a piece on 17th century findings,

07:53.881 --> 07:55.984
You would be pleased to allow them?

07:56.245 --> 07:57.066
You can have them.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.368
I mail them to them.

07:58.388 --> 07:58.889
I don't care.

07:59.269 --> 08:00.431
You can have access to anything.

08:00.451 --> 08:13.851
But what I'm saying is that the importance of what I'm doing, at least to myself, is simply getting them and making it known to those people that need to know.

08:14.392 --> 08:18.538
AAS knows who my collection is.

08:19.058 --> 08:21.483
other people know what my collection is.

08:21.503 --> 08:30.881
If someone asks a question of AAS for 17th century bindings, they'll say, among other things, call Zinman.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.947
If they call me, the collection's open to them.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.392
But I'm not sitting

08:36.760 --> 08:43.970
judgmentally and saying to you, look at this wonderful, this object is beautiful, this object is important.

08:44.451 --> 08:45.292
I'm not saying that.

08:45.672 --> 08:47.675
And I'm saying that I have no time to say it.

08:48.096 --> 08:50.880
I have, you know, in passing, it's pretty or whatever it may be.

08:51.561 --> 08:54.885
But it's for others to determine what they want to get out of it.

08:56.407 --> 08:57.809
That's the whole idea.

08:57.849 --> 09:02.776
You know, from an institutional point of view, if you want to look at it that way, it's passive, it's neutral.

09:03.597 --> 09:04.759
Take whatever you want out of it.

09:05.330 --> 09:26.396
I bought, I'll show you, among some of the really important things that I have in terms of the history of American printing, I have the only example of the only published poem of, what is it, Edward Dewey or something like that, or Edward Taylor.

09:28.739 --> 09:29.920
David Dewey, David Taylor.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.722
that everyone's going gaga over.

09:34.463 --> 09:35.444
No one knew about it.

09:35.464 --> 09:36.646
It's a fragment.

09:36.726 --> 09:38.227
It's missing the first couple of pages.

09:38.548 --> 09:39.229
But there it is.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.570
McCorrison would kill for it.

09:41.311 --> 09:48.479
I have one of the great 17th century books on science.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.342
Only copy known.

09:51.642 --> 09:55.366
I got it at an auction in Philadelphia for not a lot of money.

09:55.947 --> 09:57.108
And it's got great plates in it.

09:57.128 --> 09:59.451
One of the things I'm interested now in collecting

09:59.870 --> 10:04.976
is 17th and 18th century American illustration.

10:05.036 --> 10:05.857
Illustrations and books.

10:06.357 --> 10:08.620
I was trying to tell you that on the cut.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.161
That's my collection.

10:10.201 --> 10:11.683
American illustrations and books.

10:11.703 --> 10:14.246
Yeah, come on, I'll show you some American illustrations and books.

10:14.606 --> 10:16.328
We should clean up the table.

10:19.391 --> 10:22.755
I bought this book

10:23.613 --> 10:25.175
$3,500, I see.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.659
Yeah, this is today's a little bit more.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.642
I mean, you talk about great blindings.

10:29.702 --> 10:30.523
Look at these blindings.

10:30.603 --> 10:31.625
Crushed Morocco.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.207
Is that a contemporary binding?

10:33.227 --> 10:35.570
No, this is Riviera, Bradstreet, or whatever.

10:35.691 --> 10:36.572
Riviera, Bedford.

10:37.053 --> 10:43.842
This is DeForest Curtis, Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, Brayton Ives.

10:44.824 --> 10:46.226
Brayton Ives, pretty nice book plan.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.651
Oh, look at that.

10:49.911 --> 10:51.113
A History of the War Inn.

10:51.173 --> 10:52.455
Let's go back.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.944
Oh, it smells wonderful.

10:57.964 --> 11:01.127
You bought it like this, or did you put the... I bought it exactly like it is.

11:01.207 --> 11:02.268
Is that a Brave Knows?

11:02.308 --> 11:03.109
No, no, no.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.710
The current company had it.

11:05.311 --> 11:08.174
I had it sent down to me over... This was when no one was buying Americana.

11:08.214 --> 11:09.835
I had it sent down to me two or three times.

11:10.456 --> 11:13.799
And finally, I was at a book fair, and Billy went over.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.820
They had it there.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.501
Billy went over at Reese and bought it.

11:17.202 --> 11:19.044
And as soon as he bought it, I said, I want it.

11:19.064 --> 11:19.664
I bought it from him.

11:19.724 --> 11:20.485
I wouldn't buy it.

11:28.497 --> 11:35.163
These are all contemporary American bodies.

11:36.024 --> 11:38.646
From which century?

11:38.826 --> 11:40.088
All 17th century.

11:40.168 --> 11:43.210
So this is what we were talking about earlier.

11:43.851 --> 11:44.912
These are all American bodies.

11:44.952 --> 11:49.416
Here is probably the greatest binding on your own.

11:49.436 --> 11:51.878
This is a binding.

11:52.199 --> 11:55.341
First of all, the book is extraordinarily important.

11:55.361 --> 11:56.102
I'm not going to touch it.

11:56.142 --> 11:57.103
No, this I'll open myself.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.792
Just tell me what it is.

12:00.694 --> 12:01.314
I'll get there.

12:03.157 --> 12:08.144
Illustrious Provinces by Increase Mather.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.447
An essay for the recording of Illustrious Provinces, 1684.

12:10.467 --> 12:11.048
Providences.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.731
Providences by Increase Mather.

12:13.751 --> 12:17.236
Now, the endpapers, that's the seal.

12:17.276 --> 12:23.204
This is from a 1675 law with the seal of the colony of Massachusetts.

12:23.945 --> 12:27.310
But the thing about this is the binding is guilty.

12:28.994 --> 12:29.735
And goffered.

12:29.795 --> 12:30.195
See me?

12:30.536 --> 12:31.076
You see me?

12:31.477 --> 12:32.338
What do you call it there?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.078
It's goffering.

12:33.098 --> 12:33.879
You know where they roll it?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.541
And the spine is gilt.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.664
And this is a contemporary binding, 1685.

12:38.684 --> 12:39.445
The edges were gilt.

12:40.306 --> 12:42.228
The edges were gilt.

12:42.248 --> 12:42.409
Okay.

12:43.670 --> 12:49.716
And the idea of American gilt bindings in the 17th century, there is.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.379
So is that what you describe as an American incunable?

12:52.399 --> 12:54.522
This is an American incunable.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.685
All of these are American incunables.

12:58.306 --> 13:01.590
But what I wanted to show you, I want to show you here.

13:01.610 --> 13:04.133
Let me show you some great, this is this book that I bought.

13:05.855 --> 13:06.856
Tenebrae.

13:08.058 --> 13:11.662
Tenebrae, Eclipses of the Sun and Moon by Jacob Taylor.

13:11.682 --> 13:13.684
Printed by New York, in New York, Bradford.

13:15.306 --> 13:16.968
Okay, now Bristol is an era.

13:17.309 --> 13:18.170
This was known.

13:19.371 --> 13:24.137
At some point, you're talking about Fleming and Rosenbach.

13:24.918 --> 13:26.119
Rosenbach bought a book.

13:26.538 --> 13:40.547
And in rebinding it, the binding apparently was shot, and he opened the binding up, and the board of the binding was made of pastedowns of leaves of American books, which he gave to Wilberforce Eames at the New York Public Library.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.706
One of the pages, or one of the books, was this Tenebrae, this Jacob Taylor Ephemeris.

13:45.726 --> 13:47.809
How is it spelled Tenebrae?

13:47.829 --> 13:48.750
T-E-N-E-B-R-A-E.

13:48.770 --> 13:49.451
Okay, T-E-N-E-B-R-A-E.

13:49.611 --> 13:49.951
Okay?

13:50.652 --> 13:55.499
And it was known by a fragment of the title page and one other page.

13:55.519 --> 13:59.204
It's the only, you know, fragment of the book that was catalogued.

13:59.224 --> 13:59.905
This comes up.

14:00.285 --> 14:01.046
Jesus, look at this.

14:01.066 --> 14:01.527
Okay.

14:02.368 --> 14:09.117
And it is complete but for... This is where Samuel Freeman auctioned.

14:09.137 --> 14:10.078
I even had the catalog.

14:12.488 --> 14:12.889
All right.

14:13.409 --> 14:13.870
Complete.

14:14.671 --> 14:14.991
There.

14:15.051 --> 14:18.556
The only known textually complete copy of Bradford's, 93.

14:18.616 --> 14:19.017
It's not.

14:19.277 --> 14:20.198
It's 1697.

14:20.218 --> 14:21.340
You know what they were talking about.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.463
There's the description and what have you.

14:23.483 --> 14:31.494
Now, I think I paid, oh, I don't know, 3,000 bucks or something.

14:31.514 --> 14:32.775
It's not a lot of ways.

14:32.795 --> 14:32.976
Okay.

14:32.996 --> 14:34.858
Now, let me show you the beauty of this.

14:37.301 --> 14:38.203
You keep these things.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.187
There's this photograph.

14:41.948 --> 14:42.208
But,

14:46.559 --> 14:47.680
Somewhere in here.

14:47.700 --> 14:48.141
Look at that.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.703
Those are metal.

14:50.144 --> 14:52.166
I mean, this is 1697.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.491
You know, surveying.

14:56.312 --> 14:56.972
Geometric.

14:56.992 --> 14:59.135
Geometric, you know.

15:00.637 --> 15:04.022
Look at that.

15:04.082 --> 15:04.642
Ain't too many.

15:04.662 --> 15:05.443
There's another one in here.

15:05.764 --> 15:09.068
Ain't too many 17th century American illustrations.

15:10.089 --> 15:10.470
Jeez.

15:11.732 --> 15:12.252
There's another one.

15:12.272 --> 15:13.414
But the point that I'm saying is.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.216
What do you think the binding was in that?

15:15.685 --> 15:17.908
Oh, uh, this.

15:19.030 --> 15:21.013
That's just a simple calf.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.979
Practical people, don't ever forget that the bookbinders, for the most part, were in business.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.181
It was a business.

15:27.042 --> 15:35.535
A lot of these points that people deal with, you know, they would only reflect back on what the customers were doing, or the dealers were doing that.

15:36.496 --> 15:40.883
Uh, I want to show you some, uh, illustrations.

15:43.192 --> 15:56.250
Which I have.

15:56.270 --> 15:56.691
Do you want to enjoy?

15:56.711 --> 15:58.753
I gather you've just moved, kind of moved the stuff in here.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.539
Yeah, and you have a wall.

16:02.559 --> 16:06.644
The bookcases are beautiful.

16:06.664 --> 16:07.225
These are oak.

16:07.245 --> 16:08.627
These aren't for veneers.

16:09.328 --> 16:10.870
Yeah, it's here.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.238
Did you buy boxes like this?

16:16.278 --> 16:16.959
No, I hate them.

16:16.979 --> 16:19.281
I think I'm after close.

16:19.762 --> 16:23.666
What are the smallest boxes of those?

16:23.706 --> 16:28.491
Well, they do protect them.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.974
What do you need the boxes to go for?

16:31.994 --> 16:32.535
The books make me better.

16:32.555 --> 16:34.337
I think I'm only going to do it.

16:34.357 --> 16:34.617
Look at that.

16:34.637 --> 16:34.917
1717.

16:34.937 --> 16:40.923
A dying father's last legacy to an old child, Mr. Hugh Peter's advice to his god.

16:41.484 --> 16:44.687
Which was, keep your legs close, honey.

16:44.819 --> 16:46.046
Does so.

16:46.690 --> 16:49.446
It says here, keep your legs closed, honey.
