WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:04.000
unaccessible.

00:04.020 --> 00:05.022
They were destroying books.

00:05.542 --> 00:24.350
So what was your added, you know, I want to... So I began to learn at the commission meetings the necessity of trashing the Old Main as this dark, terrible building that really had no, had practically no books in it.

00:24.750 --> 00:31.320
I'll never forget the meeting where Dowlin, and I told you how he came into this meeting, his plan

00:31.553 --> 00:36.419
to save money now and make up for the deficit was to cut more staff.

00:38.702 --> 00:46.453
Well, he didn't mean the top staff, of course, but the cut staff, typical CEO mentality.

00:47.474 --> 00:59.029
But I hear, then there's this incredible farewell to Dowling meeting,

00:59.617 --> 01:10.513
It would be worth your getting, have you talked with Peter, last name, Peter Warfield?

01:12.356 --> 01:20.909
Peter, it's essential you talk with him because he got tapes of all the commission meetings.

01:21.109 --> 01:28.560
I was buying them for a while, too, and I was, as a matter of fact, looking in my room for where I'd put those of them that I had bought.

01:29.198 --> 01:34.746
At the meeting where Dowlin finally realized he was going to have to go.

01:34.786 --> 01:42.258
Agnos, Art Agnos, who I have such honor for.

01:42.578 --> 01:46.144
He's a wonderful, wonderful representative.

01:46.284 --> 01:47.085
I knew him, you know.

01:47.145 --> 01:47.846
He went to Bates.

01:47.966 --> 01:49.148
I went to Bates College.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.191
Oh, uh-huh.

01:50.211 --> 01:50.892
I didn't know him well.

01:50.973 --> 01:55.580
He was a year or two ahead of me, but... What's the name of the other college besides Bates?

01:55.640 --> 01:58.885
Bates, Bowden, and Colby are the three colleges in Maine.

01:58.965 --> 01:59.506
Yes, uh-huh.

01:59.526 --> 02:01.970
I went to Bates, which is... Uh-huh, yeah.

02:01.990 --> 02:03.091
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:03.111 --> 02:10.022
Well, at the farewell, every commissioner...

02:11.167 --> 02:26.651
And Art Agnes came from Washington for it, and he told about the great visionary that unfortunately, because, and he's quoting Dowling's excuses, his weakness is that he's not really a finance man.

02:26.691 --> 02:28.854
That was what he said.

02:29.275 --> 02:36.786
Anyhow, so Agnes talks about the vision he had for this great new library,

02:37.103 --> 02:41.469
and so forth and so on.

02:41.549 --> 02:42.650
He's in Washington.

02:42.710 --> 02:45.033
His wife is on the commission.

02:46.215 --> 03:01.074
Well, Sherry Agnos, I've often felt like asking her, because I'm pretty sure she did, didn't you ever bring your kids besides to the wonderful neighborhood library on Petrero Hill, because they lived on Petrero Hill.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.617
Well, I know, because one of my...

03:04.272 --> 03:14.230
Somebody I know very well, you know, was a neighbor, and she was using, before he was ever mayor, before he went to Washington.

03:14.250 --> 03:21.984
But anyhow, she refers to the old Maine as out of the dark ages.

03:22.265 --> 03:23.547
This is Agnos' wife?

03:23.847 --> 03:29.717
Sherry Agnos, who's on the Library Commission, who I would have expected.

03:29.737 --> 03:35.125
There were no libraries in the Dark Ages, I don't think.

03:35.326 --> 03:42.137
Well, there were certain libraries in the monasteries, in the monasteries.

03:42.157 --> 03:42.658
That's an oxymoron.

03:43.479 --> 03:50.310
And there were certain, you know, but when it came to a public library, there wasn't even literacy.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.694
Very few people had literacy.

03:53.714 --> 03:54.034
Literacy.

03:54.054 --> 03:55.336
What a horrible thing to say.

03:55.356 --> 03:57.458
What a horrible thing to say, actually.

03:57.899 --> 04:00.142
Well... That the library was out of the dark ages.

04:00.442 --> 04:17.563
Yeah, well, anyhow, when you think of all the people who used and got so much out of that library to refer to it as out of the dark ages, well, anyhow, they did not have...

04:19.315 --> 04:45.762
No, I'm not remembering right that they didn't have public comment, because there were people who got up and many of the library staff, one of whom it turned out afterwards was not really saying what he thought, but had been asked to speak in support of Darwin.

04:46.062 --> 04:54.335
a wonderful Filipino woman who comes and was so moved by how Dowland sat there.

04:54.375 --> 04:59.504
This was not the one where he was defending himself, but where he knew he was on his way out.

05:00.706 --> 05:13.386
And she spoke sorrowfully about how hard it must be for him, but that he was going to go on to something else, she was sure, and she wished him well, which was very nice.

05:13.957 --> 05:18.322
But librarians got up and spooked, and now I remember that meeting.

05:18.342 --> 05:21.345
One of them was so wonderful.

05:21.425 --> 05:31.256
She's from one of the branch libraries, and she said, and she said, she said, you have nothing but contempt for us, she says.

05:31.296 --> 05:38.344
Never in my, in all of my years, and I will be retiring in a few years,

05:39.134 --> 05:44.400
Until you came, could I have imagined someone who is in charge of the library?

05:44.440 --> 05:45.781
This is all on tape.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.364
You have to get it from Peter.

05:50.487 --> 05:50.867
I'll find it.

05:50.887 --> 05:53.190
I'll call him, or I'll call you.

05:53.330 --> 05:54.251
I'll get it from Walter.

05:54.271 --> 05:54.571
Don't worry.

05:54.651 --> 05:56.694
Walter.

05:59.477 --> 06:05.243
But you have to get the incredible tape of that meeting.

06:06.826 --> 06:08.368
God, I have thousands.

06:08.528 --> 06:10.831
None of this is alphabetized.

06:11.392 --> 06:12.494
Let's not worry about it right now.

06:12.514 --> 06:13.375
All right, okay.

06:13.916 --> 06:34.403
Anyway, it was absolutely heart-rending the way she spoke of the change in how she felt and how she hated to have anything to do, even to come into the new Maine, because she might...

06:35.092 --> 06:39.438
There's just this treatment of the branch libraries and the branch librarians.

06:39.498 --> 06:43.264
By the way, we have wonderful branch libraries and branch librarians.

06:44.786 --> 06:45.006
What?

06:45.267 --> 06:46.228
He wanted to close them.

06:46.308 --> 06:46.689
I know.

06:46.749 --> 06:49.433
Not all of them, but some of them.

06:49.813 --> 06:50.214
But most of them.

06:50.234 --> 06:50.454
Yes.

06:50.474 --> 06:57.384
Well, you know, to him, you get into a car and you drive or maybe even have a chauffeur.

06:57.424 --> 06:58.966
Everything's accessible.

06:59.928 --> 07:03.613
You know, I really don't think he'sâ€”I may be faulting him.

07:03.847 --> 07:09.555
Anyhow, he spoke about his son, the greatness of computers.

07:09.615 --> 07:11.778
This was in his farewell address.

07:12.399 --> 07:31.504
And I thought, well, if your son only watches the computer and does not read, he will not get into those schools you want him to get into because what the elite schools look for is somebody who can write a critical essay.

07:32.606 --> 07:32.706
Yeah.

07:34.289 --> 07:35.631
Amazing.

07:35.651 --> 07:42.483
So let's, when you found out that books without, were just being dumped by the truckload.

07:42.604 --> 07:55.386
Oh, well, part of me was so hurt, and I found out about it first when I went to the meeting of the, um, um, finance and, uh,

07:57.526 --> 07:58.767
I suddenly can't remember.

07:58.787 --> 08:02.911
Oh, by the way, here is also one of the earliest things.

08:03.051 --> 08:05.934
We're going to stop pretty soon because it's gone over two hours.

08:05.954 --> 08:11.899
Well, I have to... And I don't want to over-stay my welcome.

08:13.581 --> 08:20.567
Well, what was it I was looking up that I had to find?

08:20.687 --> 08:26.773
And I need to find what I, myself, the one thing that I wrote.

08:27.665 --> 08:31.109
What did I say just before this?

08:32.932 --> 08:34.474
I was looking for something.

08:37.658 --> 08:54.820
Well, anyhow, we finally began to get articles in the paper, and then a lot of the, by the way, you probably have this, when he didn't talk about the strategic future, except in that very narrow term.

08:56.673 --> 08:57.734
Oh, hell.

08:59.315 --> 09:01.717
Well, I'll have to mail that to you too.

09:02.518 --> 09:04.940
Probably may not even be in here.

09:04.980 --> 09:15.469
Oh, there's that thing about the shocking thing.

09:15.530 --> 09:21.475
You see, we should be, they should be sending books to the school.

09:21.515 --> 09:25.178
They should supply the schools that don't have

09:26.575 --> 09:48.972
libraries with books, and they should carefully select books that first and second graders might love, and that would bring them on to other books, and some of them should be, oh, this is, by the way, speaking of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, none of these books were in, but they said some of them were.

09:51.905 --> 10:02.861
Oh, well, this is coolers on the public librarian books, which I understand, though it may... I don't know if it's true or not that he didn't write it.

10:03.061 --> 10:15.839
Oh, this is that thing where we were trashed.

10:15.859 --> 10:16.840
I've seen this, yeah.

10:16.860 --> 10:17.581
Do you have that?

10:17.742 --> 10:18.062
Yeah.

10:18.102 --> 10:21.507
Well, you see, that was the attitude.

10:21.875 --> 10:27.220
So holy was the library that they did not listen to the truth.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.483
And some of it may have been us.

10:30.684 --> 10:38.412
I was troubled in the beginning because it was confrontational when people got up to speak.

10:38.852 --> 10:40.213
Of course, bit by bit.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.476
Then we were cut down to three minutes.

10:42.916 --> 10:45.599
Then the minutes themselves stopped being minutes.

10:45.859 --> 10:47.461
That's the latest thing, you know.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.865
And the last minutes, they would not identify anybody.

10:52.570 --> 11:20.113
by name and i got up at the minutes and i said and i identified who the people were and i said their name should be there so first of all cooler as usual tried to shut me up and i didn't shut up but anyhow this is the latest thing that the minutes are not supposed to be instructive so he finally listened when one of the librarians under good and welfare

11:20.971 --> 11:40.768
who followed me, as a matter of fact, pointed out that the minutes go out to the branch librarians who are not there that night because they're at the branch libraries, and what will they know about what happened at the commission meetings if this is what they are presented with?

11:41.896 --> 11:50.185
Well, anyhow, I don't know what's going to happen because they already voted that they were not going to enlarge the minutes and put in names.

11:50.245 --> 11:51.366
They were going to keep this.

11:52.106 --> 11:55.710
We had a wonderful secretary who kept the most wonderful minutes.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.692
Do you have copies of previous minutes?

11:58.033 --> 11:58.113
Yes.

11:58.133 --> 12:05.200
Well, you should just simply compare them with the last minutes and see how much information you got about what really went on.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.262
The action is what you heard.

12:07.816 --> 12:18.809
But as far as what the public said, you did not... Oh, Finance Operations and Building Committee.

12:18.889 --> 12:20.451
That was where I first went.

12:20.832 --> 12:36.270
Where I first heard about the books that were being dumped, and I heard to my horror that because books had a torn binding, or it was dog-eared, so I got up and I talked about

12:36.503 --> 12:46.152
what it had given me as a writer about the book in which I read, El Otima Adios, that was in Hey, Sailor, What Ship?

12:46.172 --> 12:57.483
And I'd been urged by the librarians to talk about my credentials to speak, because everybody else was, you know, had no, they were just, it was all ego, and some ego was involved.

12:57.963 --> 13:04.890
But anyhow, so, but you know, people got very confrontational.

13:05.208 --> 13:10.613
And I didn't understand it in the beginning, but then I realized what brings it on.

13:10.673 --> 13:15.197
You're ignored, or you're put down, or you're ruled out of order.

13:16.278 --> 13:21.263
I began to get confrontational, and I am confrontational now.

13:23.025 --> 13:34.776
You should ask one of the librarians or somebody who is the way I spoke with Kulder after he talked about our having a special agenda.

13:35.110 --> 13:38.873
and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know.

13:38.893 --> 13:52.405
I quoted it back to him, and I also stood there asking him for what I knew I was not going to get, which was, well, here's some more.

13:52.505 --> 13:53.826
Here was another instance.

13:53.926 --> 13:58.850
I kept these damn things, so I'd write for them, and then I wouldn't get anything.

13:58.890 --> 14:04.375
So is your fear that these books would be... This was in the beginning, you know, and then I thought,

14:04.574 --> 14:31.797
it's true it's something that is really honestly honestly truly happening now what's happening is that the committees they haven't met for months and we only have the one commission meeting to go to so you know another thing i determined with nick baker today is he has a list of all these uh books that were last copies in the system 18 000 of them but then i said

14:31.979 --> 14:34.982
Well, is there a list of all the books that they've gotten rid of?

14:35.862 --> 14:36.143
No.

14:36.543 --> 14:43.069
You realize that nobody even kept a record of the books or they have destroyed them all.

14:43.169 --> 14:50.916
And I said, my God, it's like killing people and not even keeping the name of the person.

14:50.936 --> 15:01.986
I mean, it's almost like a death camp metaphor in a way that you send books off to the dump and you don't even keep a record of the book that you had of the people once read and were nourished by it.

15:02.371 --> 15:07.018
And he said it's an anti-intellectual attitude that they have.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.600
And I think he's right.

15:08.941 --> 15:14.890
I think it's so arrogant that not only do you dump the books, you don't even keep a record.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.573
It's like at least keep the person's name.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.295
Keep the memory of that book.

15:18.355 --> 15:20.579
There is no reverence for the book.

15:21.680 --> 15:26.307
I'm sorry to go off like this, but I've never seen anything like this in my life.

15:26.548 --> 15:27.990
I became convinced

15:28.342 --> 15:36.632
that Dowling really does believe that books are absolutely obsolete, that it's like that first little tremor of wonder.

15:36.772 --> 15:47.606
What is this sign, you know, that ends with we do not know how long they'll be around?

15:49.468 --> 15:50.910
Were there any books?

15:51.010 --> 15:53.353
And that sign was at every bus stop.

15:54.548 --> 15:57.431
It was your invitation to come to the new Maine.

15:57.671 --> 15:59.333
So you talk about irony of ironies.

15:59.693 --> 15:59.994
Yes.

16:00.634 --> 16:04.038
Yeah, that was my first indication something was wrong.

16:04.598 --> 16:06.320
Well, I never mentioned that to Spencer.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.962
You mean this quote here we're talking about?

16:08.262 --> 16:08.863
Exactly.

16:11.165 --> 16:13.728
Well, what is the subtext here?

16:13.748 --> 16:15.590
What is this saying to you when you saw this?

16:15.610 --> 16:17.752
Well, to me, I didn't understand.

16:18.212 --> 16:21.636
This is the invitation to the new Maine library?

16:22.308 --> 16:24.672
and come and get them while they last.

16:25.173 --> 16:32.785
But I kind of put it aside until I, you know, I thought, well, you know, it's just somebody's dumb idea.

16:33.587 --> 16:47.910
Somebody found a quote in a thesaurus, maybe, but it's... Well, it doesn't say even... Well, no, I asked and I was told that this was in something that one of the Bloomsbury Circle...

16:48.751 --> 16:54.258
One of Virginia's closest friends.

16:57.262 --> 17:00.926
He wrote about the Victorians.

17:00.946 --> 17:02.028
You know who I mean.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.570
Not Lytton Strachey.

17:03.590 --> 17:03.830
What?

17:04.050 --> 17:04.551
Strachey?

17:04.631 --> 17:06.814
No, it wasn't Strachey, so it wasn't him.

17:06.934 --> 17:07.755
No, anyhow.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.319
Well, I'll tell you.

17:11.339 --> 17:14.724
Do you mind if I take a couple of photographs of you, by the way?

17:15.004 --> 17:15.665
Is that okay?

17:15.825 --> 17:16.546
A couple of what?

17:16.566 --> 17:17.307
Photographs.

17:17.759 --> 17:18.860
No, go ahead.

17:21.283 --> 17:22.545
Well, we still have this nice light.

17:22.605 --> 17:23.686
You can keep talking.

17:23.726 --> 17:24.267
Good evening.

17:24.387 --> 17:25.588
I'm Kendall.

17:28.852 --> 17:32.076
Were there any books that you went in to find there?

17:32.116 --> 17:34.199
That I was able to find?

17:34.439 --> 17:38.845
That were not there, that particularly distressed you?

17:40.006 --> 17:42.789
You mentioned Higginson, right?

17:43.170 --> 17:45.893
Well, I was particularly distressed by...

17:46.700 --> 18:02.463
Well, among other things, they had a wonderful collection, although Andrea tells me that she looked up and that they ordered more of them or were going to have more of them or something of that nature.

18:03.044 --> 18:09.874
They had something called the Shakespeare Head Bronte, and they had every single letter in it.

18:10.655 --> 18:12.538
First, they had the complete poems.

18:12.974 --> 18:16.920
Then they had every single letter that any of those sisters ever wrote.

18:17.701 --> 18:42.357
And that, along with reading Zachary, was where I discovered how much fun they made of Charlotte Bronte when she came to London, thinking she was at last going to have a literary company, and how...

18:42.640 --> 18:48.047
Instead, poor little shriveled woman of genius.

18:49.148 --> 18:51.011
How she would have given anything.

18:51.031 --> 18:58.680
He is writing this to some young society girl.

18:58.700 --> 19:05.409
To be as beautiful and attractive as you are.

19:05.429 --> 19:07.772
How she would have given up all of her fame.

19:09.554 --> 19:09.694
Uh-huh.

19:10.332 --> 19:21.806
This is something else that got hell, and I don't know where the other half of it is, but I'm looking for my own piece, and I can't find it.

19:22.667 --> 19:26.191
The piece I wrote before the Main Library ever opened.

19:27.553 --> 19:31.658
Kathy Page's August 26 letter to Main Library staff.

19:31.758 --> 19:36.964
Oh, this is when I was making up kits to send to people.

19:39.138 --> 19:41.261
to tell them what was going on.

19:41.281 --> 20:01.066
I also gave complete sets to the Library Commission members at one point of everything I had as things began to be proved that what was in this kit were true and they had been denying it or ignoring it or didn't know.

20:01.106 --> 20:02.968
Well,

20:08.517 --> 20:23.028
So I put in a lot of my life between the police commission and anyhow, this was, well, I guess that you got things like this, didn't you?

20:23.248 --> 20:25.874
I think Walter's given me just about everything.

20:25.894 --> 20:26.796
I'm sure.

20:27.400 --> 20:32.488
Well, he probably didn't give you my thing that appeared that my tribute to the library.

20:32.548 --> 20:38.898
That's quoted from in... I had it a second ago.

20:38.958 --> 20:52.480
In the annual report that year, it's just something about this library, my comfort, my refuge...

20:53.607 --> 20:59.213
My teacher, I've forgotten what it was, but anyhow, I had, but I'll find it.

20:59.393 --> 21:00.534
It's somewhere.

21:00.695 --> 21:01.415
You know what I think?

21:01.476 --> 21:03.338
I think it's time for us to probably.

21:03.358 --> 21:03.518
Madness.

21:06.261 --> 21:09.885
Oh, it's in this report, but only that one sentence.

21:10.005 --> 21:22.298
I'm going to, you give me one more minute, and then afterwards I'll begin to remember all the things that I never, you know, this is far more recent.

21:23.915 --> 21:33.603
Oh, I hope you got all of these things from, from, from... I don't know yet.

21:33.643 --> 21:37.466
Walter is going to send me this stuff, but look at this, huh, from the City Librarian.

21:46.094 --> 21:53.500
What is, well, is that the one that, that has in, in the middle the, the other thing?

21:54.070 --> 21:56.954
that I was looking for, The True University.

21:56.974 --> 21:58.736
Yes, it's a collection of books.

21:58.756 --> 22:02.480
There's wonderful quotes in it that are tributes to books.

22:03.041 --> 22:12.933
That was from the thing I put before.

22:12.953 --> 22:17.098
You should talk to... Oh, there's your quote right there.

22:17.478 --> 22:17.739
What?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.581
No, that's a small part of it.

22:19.641 --> 22:21.023
I don't mean a small part.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.845
It was only a couple of paragraphs.

22:23.770 --> 22:27.835
But no, it wouldn't be March.

22:27.855 --> 22:29.618
That was way back.

22:31.360 --> 22:36.006
Anyhow, a lot of trees went, didn't they, and the material around it.

22:36.026 --> 22:44.177
Here's another, Access, Discover, Empower through Multimedia, which is certainly a big help.

22:51.546 --> 22:52.107
Well...

22:55.799 --> 23:00.305
You would think I would have a whole file of my own thing.

23:00.466 --> 23:06.033
Old library had more books, critics say.

23:06.294 --> 23:15.787
Well, we finally began to crack through the wall of silence, and then came more and more revelations that couldn't be denied.

23:15.847 --> 23:20.574
This was published by the library itself or by the Friends?

23:21.215 --> 23:21.435
What?

23:21.854 --> 23:25.079
This publication right here with your quote, who published this?

23:25.099 --> 23:27.403
Well, that was published by the library itself.

23:27.443 --> 23:30.248
That was the annual report, isn't it?

23:30.809 --> 23:32.652
From the library, I should say.

23:35.276 --> 23:39.924
So you were at this point considered an ally at this point.

23:39.944 --> 23:42.388
No, it was before the new Maine opened, isn't it?

23:42.408 --> 23:43.209
Look at the date.

23:43.670 --> 23:44.291
Just a second.

23:44.311 --> 23:45.533
I want to finish writing this down.

23:50.643 --> 24:03.721
And that's probably why it's not in these files, except I dug it out at one point, because I was going to... This is the 1994-95 annual report.

24:04.863 --> 24:06.605
Yes, uh-huh, yeah.

24:06.666 --> 24:18.422
Well, I told you it was before the new Maine had ever opened, but it was... This is actually a...

24:18.908 --> 24:21.251
One of the police files.

24:21.271 --> 24:23.273
What's that doing in here?

24:23.293 --> 24:25.816
Well, when I find it, I'll mail it to you.

24:25.836 --> 24:27.598
Well, this is very good, too.

24:27.678 --> 24:28.298
Look at this.

24:28.419 --> 24:29.280
Take it.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.080
Oh, I can take this?

24:30.181 --> 24:31.042
Yes, take it.

24:31.162 --> 24:32.143
Well, I have another one.

24:32.283 --> 24:32.783
Oh, great.

24:33.384 --> 24:33.805
That's great.

24:34.245 --> 24:35.426
I have another one, yes.

24:35.486 --> 24:35.927
You see?

24:35.987 --> 24:45.878
And this was in spite of Dowling before he had his...

24:47.798 --> 24:48.940
Can I take these, too?

24:49.180 --> 24:51.463
Are you giving these to me?

24:51.543 --> 24:53.746
Well, aren't you going to see him?

24:53.866 --> 24:54.367
Yes, I am.

24:54.387 --> 25:02.278
Well, listen, this guy is the only guy who's been going to Library Commission meetings for something like... Yeah, 20 years.

25:02.318 --> 25:05.082
I don't think it's 20, but it's pretty close to 20.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.523
He is a love.

25:07.285 --> 25:09.628
And he is so literary.

25:09.728 --> 25:13.553
When you get him in a car, he and I love exchanging...

25:13.803 --> 25:16.125
Things we've memorized.

25:16.686 --> 25:20.530
I've never had a chance to really sit down and talk with him.

25:21.151 --> 25:21.912
Here he has.

25:21.932 --> 25:25.355
You can, if you need these, call me.

25:25.716 --> 25:27.237
I'm supposed to actually see him tonight.

25:27.377 --> 25:29.560
Oh, well, that's going to be great.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.642
Well, I should feed you something quick.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.244
No, no, no.

25:33.284 --> 25:34.525
Sandwich or something.

25:34.765 --> 25:35.666
No, thanks.

25:36.067 --> 25:36.567
Thank you.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.189
Well, we sat too long.

25:38.309 --> 25:40.131
I'm going to have to take a long walk.

25:40.415 --> 25:43.239
I'm going to go back and call my wife and kids.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.426
Well, I can give you a phone if you want, but privacy.

25:47.866 --> 25:48.287
No, no.

25:48.948 --> 25:53.255
Actually, I'm going to shut this off now.

25:53.275 --> 25:56.460
I started to say the first thing that I'm going to say.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.985
Okay.

26:00.005 --> 26:05.053
Yeah, you see, not on the shelves, third floor, paging desk, missing.

26:05.874 --> 26:08.278
This was, I think, my first indication.

26:08.298 --> 26:09.139
That's Higginson.

26:09.288 --> 26:37.708
uh no no no these this i think it is the um are the brontes are the brontes um oh that wonderful can i just see what titles they were that you were looking for well i don't think it even has the title thing it's just the numbers right oh i see sure yeah it doesn't say because in the beginning that's that's all that came up it didn't have the title but the brontes were missing what

26:38.178 --> 26:40.561
But you were looking for some Brontes, and they were looking.

26:41.742 --> 26:42.203
Yes.

26:42.223 --> 26:44.005
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

26:44.025 --> 26:47.889
Uh-huh.

26:47.909 --> 26:50.592
Yes, and I, but they probably got torn.

26:50.653 --> 27:06.531
They were old, and that meeting I got up, my heart was just breaking to think of them destroying that book in which I got the complete text of El Ultimo, Adios, because it, it was,

27:06.933 --> 27:07.914
A little ragged.

27:08.015 --> 27:20.612
Well, also, when you speak about some of the books I most love, those that we had a fire in this apartment, and I lost a lot of books.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.418
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:24.558 --> 27:27.642
But a lot were saved, too.

27:28.870 --> 27:33.578
Some of the terrible shapes, some of the books I brought were in.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.141
Some were coverless.

27:35.622 --> 27:40.210
Some had pages missing and so forth and so on, but they were treasures.

27:40.751 --> 27:44.939
Stanford has my volume of that, 1861 Atlantic.

27:48.085 --> 27:52.212
I gave that to them.

27:52.867 --> 27:54.929
You look tired, so I think I'm going to stop.

27:54.949 --> 27:55.590
No, I'm not tired.

27:55.650 --> 27:56.751
I'm very reflective.

27:56.772 --> 28:01.877
I'm tired of sitting because I try to do standards.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.840
We've got close to three hours of tape.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.041
Poor you.

28:05.682 --> 28:08.725
You have to only transcribe what's important.

28:08.986 --> 28:11.649
I'm very selective, but I do listen to it.

28:11.789 --> 28:14.932
And I do it on the computer, I have to say.

28:14.993 --> 28:18.857
And I love your book.

28:18.955 --> 28:19.616
You're kind.

28:20.117 --> 28:24.662
And I'm sorry that there isn't a book about how poor people collect books.

28:25.143 --> 28:26.064
I'd be glad to.

28:26.264 --> 28:26.945
I'd like to know.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.168
Well, I would be glad to donate some.

28:29.188 --> 28:34.295
Well, who do you suppose buys in places like McDonald's?

28:34.575 --> 28:36.518
They never classify their books.

28:36.618 --> 28:38.280
It's a bookstore here.

28:38.513 --> 28:39.554
You go in there.

28:39.715 --> 28:41.537
Sometimes things are on the floor.

28:41.577 --> 28:43.400
You pick up things from the floor.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.461
Where are they?

28:44.822 --> 28:47.225
I don't know where McDonald's moved to.

28:47.565 --> 28:49.748
I'd have to look in the phone room.

28:49.888 --> 28:50.329
M-C-D-O-N-A-L-D-A?

28:50.349 --> 28:50.589
Yes.

28:50.670 --> 28:51.471
It's a bookstore?

28:51.491 --> 28:51.751
Yes.

28:52.132 --> 28:53.553
It's a used bookstore.

28:53.574 --> 28:54.355
But for poor people.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.317
It's in the... Well, no.

28:56.518 --> 28:59.141
Book collectors go there, too, I'm sure.

28:59.261 --> 29:00.022
I might go there.

29:00.062 --> 29:01.044
That might be a story.

29:01.705 --> 29:02.546
Show up, yes.

29:03.307 --> 29:06.952
But that's where I got a number of books.

29:06.992 --> 29:07.913
McDonald's.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.146
at their old location.

29:11.449 --> 29:14.133
But I think they're on the other side of it.

29:14.153 --> 29:18.701
Don't forget, that book was about the collecting impulse.

29:18.721 --> 29:24.291
And I would like to think that the greater theme there was also the preservation of knowledge.

29:24.311 --> 29:25.673
Oh, absolutely.

29:25.693 --> 29:26.394
Oh, of course.

29:26.715 --> 29:29.259
Oh, I mean, it's a real book lover's book.

29:29.339 --> 29:29.860
Thank you.

29:30.341 --> 29:31.102
You know that.

29:31.343 --> 29:32.685
It's just a

29:32.952 --> 29:35.116
Well, I'm going to buy a copy.

29:35.156 --> 29:39.523
I'm going to send you one, if you allow me.

29:39.823 --> 29:43.850
I didn't carry any out here with me because they weigh about four pounds each.

29:45.272 --> 29:47.676
What I would like very much to do is send you a copy.

29:48.217 --> 29:57.492
Well, you know, I never realized I became a scholar out of the library until somebody told me when I gave my first silences talk.

29:59.142 --> 30:08.336
I was so startled, and I still didn't believe it, and it took that night after MLA.

30:08.396 --> 30:20.454
Adrian Rich was on that panel and spoke a very different way about books.

30:20.474 --> 30:25.521
Why am I looking under MAC when I'm looking under bookstores?

30:26.024 --> 30:28.706
Yes, please let me when I get home.

30:28.766 --> 30:30.048
I've ordered some new books.

30:30.088 --> 30:31.929
They should actually be here.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.711
They should arrive on a way.

30:40.136 --> 30:55.109
And, you know, the Bay Area is a book lover's... Oh, I know.

30:55.130 --> 30:55.710
McDonald's.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.904
I guess it's after the M.A.s.

30:59.004 --> 31:08.519
I thought it was going to be ... Don't tell me ... These are the brand new books that I just got today.

31:08.559 --> 31:24.043
They're certainly still in the ... Oh, books, new books, no wonder.

31:24.378 --> 31:26.480
Where are they?

31:26.640 --> 31:28.862
Here are books used and rare.

31:29.323 --> 31:30.124
Okay.

31:31.445 --> 31:34.087
Oh, how I'd love to go prowling around.

31:36.330 --> 31:37.871
McDonald's book shop.

31:37.931 --> 31:40.253
See, add under book tailors, retail.

31:40.293 --> 31:43.216
Oh, they're on 48 Turk Street.

31:43.236 --> 31:44.277
48 Turk.

31:44.297 --> 31:45.238
How about their phone number?

31:45.859 --> 31:45.939
Hmm?

31:45.959 --> 31:46.900
What's their phone number?

31:47.060 --> 31:53.406
Okay, their phone number is 673-2235.

31:53.977 --> 31:57.740
Well, they used to be over on the other side of market on 3rd.

31:59.302 --> 32:00.063
I'll take a look.

32:00.083 --> 32:01.264
I'll go over there.

32:02.725 --> 32:02.825
Yeah.

32:05.387 --> 32:08.690
But anyhow, they were a wonderful place to buy books.

32:11.593 --> 32:16.017
Did you say you had a lot of poor people going in there for books?

32:16.618 --> 32:22.363
Well, there were people like me, and the location was a good location.

32:22.681 --> 32:28.147
even for really poor people, because it was just half a block from what used to be Skid Row.

32:29.629 --> 32:42.905
But no, but it was people who couldn't afford, you know, and there were times I wouldn't think of ourselves as really having a terrible economic problem at all, but there wasn't money.

32:42.945 --> 32:51.675
If you have four kids and a lot of other things that require money, you know, books are a luxury.

32:52.094 --> 32:56.865
But you could pick up secondhand books.

32:57.386 --> 32:58.308
Who's McDonald's?

32:58.328 --> 32:59.771
Is that name for a person?

32:59.891 --> 33:00.954
Is McDonald's something?

33:00.974 --> 33:02.617
It was the name of a person.

33:02.737 --> 33:06.105
And I don't think the original McDonald's is alive anymore.

33:06.125 --> 33:07.448
But maybe his kids are there.

33:07.468 --> 33:09.833
I wonder if he had a philosophy about making books.

33:10.792 --> 33:14.735
I never spoke with him.

33:14.816 --> 33:17.998
That would have been a fascinating thing to have found out.

33:18.018 --> 33:19.440
To find out what his motivation was.

33:19.460 --> 33:22.202
Because it was really a wonderful... I've had so many books.

33:22.222 --> 33:23.263
He had so many books.

33:23.303 --> 33:24.324
He brought everything.

33:24.784 --> 33:26.746
And I brought a complete set.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.629
This was when I got my first money.

33:29.649 --> 33:39.437
I brought a complete set of illustrated... of Dickens.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.478
Short stories.

33:41.487 --> 33:46.712
and some of the volumes too.

33:47.353 --> 33:55.101
There were more time I'd show you some of the things that I picked up, but that was really very rare and very wonderful.

33:57.624 --> 34:02.409
And remember what Somersuk Mom said about books as a writer.

34:03.750 --> 34:09.216
He said, my heart sinks when I go to a bookstore

34:10.597 --> 34:16.464
He said, I dread going into the library for that reason, too.

34:16.484 --> 34:30.279
He says, when I see all those books there being sold for next to nothing, and think of what went into writing those books, and there they are practically.

34:30.319 --> 34:36.306
He didn't use the word trash, but, you know, a word like that.

34:38.047 --> 34:39.589
Outcasts.

34:39.609 --> 34:39.749
Yeah.

34:39.789 --> 34:40.070
Uh-huh.

34:40.090 --> 34:40.350
Yeah.

34:40.972 --> 34:42.794
very poignantly about that.

34:42.874 --> 34:46.958
I guess he was feeling nobody was ever going to read him once he died.

34:46.978 --> 34:51.842
I don't know if people do, but he wrote a wonderful book about books and reading.

34:51.922 --> 34:52.783
It's in that book.

34:53.484 --> 34:54.104
Mom did?

34:54.445 --> 34:55.486
Somerset Mom.

35:01.271 --> 35:02.292
Somerset Mom.

35:02.913 --> 35:04.234
Yeah.

35:04.254 --> 35:08.178
Well, I'm sure it's books in print or books out of print.

35:08.218 --> 35:10.860
You probably know how to get books that are out of print.

35:11.887 --> 35:13.830
Or it may be at McDonald's.

35:14.731 --> 35:15.972
What's the title of it?

35:16.033 --> 35:16.233
Books?

35:16.273 --> 35:24.023
I don't remember what the... No, it's in his... He's writing about himself, his own life.

35:24.043 --> 35:24.904
It's a memoir.

35:24.964 --> 35:25.185
What?

35:25.205 --> 35:26.066
It's a memoir.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.107
It's a memoir.

35:27.207 --> 35:27.508
Yes.

35:30.051 --> 35:32.835
But it's not a skinny book.

35:32.855 --> 35:34.096
He had a lot to say.

35:34.137 --> 35:36.420
I'm going to leave you.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.060
You'd better.

35:37.120 --> 35:41.286
And you have been just so... Well, I'll send you...

35:41.519 --> 35:47.244
What I wrote about the public library when I run across it, I know I have it somewhere.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.628
Let's take a few pictures, if you don't mind.

35:52.309 --> 35:54.791
Would you like to take a picture of me with Emily?

35:54.851 --> 35:55.532
Yes, I would.

35:55.812 --> 35:56.253
Absolutely.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.194
That's Emily.

35:59.636 --> 36:02.278
These were done by... Should I pull them?

36:02.519 --> 36:05.682
Yeah, because I'm getting glare, and I do want to get Emily's picture in there.

36:09.245 --> 36:09.825
Yeah, that's good.

36:09.845 --> 36:10.446
That's fine.

36:10.527 --> 36:11.368
Okay.

36:12.549 --> 36:14.791
It's done by Barbara Swann.

36:14.931 --> 36:15.552
It's beautiful.

36:16.433 --> 36:22.159
And one of the four lipos is in the Emily Dickinson house.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.121
Really?

36:28.705 --> 36:30.547
It's not in black and white.

36:30.567 --> 36:36.113
It's done in the color of her hair, like the sherry left in the glass.

36:37.474 --> 36:38.155
Oh, this is nice.

36:52.816 --> 36:58.782
Are you taking pictures of the entire cast of characters of the Muddites?

36:59.223 --> 37:01.685
As many as I can, yeah.

37:01.745 --> 37:02.646
You'll have already?

37:03.347 --> 37:09.714
I don't know how many you can use, but to me it's documentation, you know, it's important.

37:10.655 --> 37:13.097
During the time when the prisms are beginning.

37:13.217 --> 37:13.878
Isn't it beautiful?

37:15.179 --> 37:16.180
Float around.

37:17.482 --> 37:19.203
Okay, we can open this again.

37:19.684 --> 37:22.587
Maybe can I get a picture of you with your books too?

37:23.208 --> 37:24.570
Just standing over here.

37:25.752 --> 37:27.534
You mean just to prove that I'm a reader?

37:28.195 --> 37:29.797
Well, that's nice.

37:29.977 --> 37:32.961
I love pictures with books in the background.

37:33.202 --> 37:38.008
Well, so do I. If it's a good one, we'll use it on my next book.

37:38.169 --> 37:39.671
Oh, that would be great.

37:39.691 --> 37:40.392
I'm serious.

37:41.794 --> 37:42.775
I'm coming in tight.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.384
Oh, that's a great picture.

37:51.254 --> 37:52.556
Did you get Gutenberg?

37:53.257 --> 37:54.498
Is that Gutenberg?

37:54.518 --> 37:56.881
Yeah, that's Gutenberg.

37:57.062 --> 37:58.664
And of course, you know what this is?

38:00.046 --> 38:00.286
No.

38:02.108 --> 38:08.697
In the days before the new kind of studying books from a computer.

38:08.717 --> 38:10.660
Oh, that's a tray for type.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.402
That's right.

38:13.023 --> 38:20.653
My guy, after he was McCarthy'd off the waterfront and became...

38:21.325 --> 38:25.730
I mean, after he became a printer.

38:28.333 --> 38:28.994
What happened?

38:29.014 --> 38:29.895
He became a printer.

38:31.637 --> 38:35.761
Well, so that's why Gutenberg.

38:35.781 --> 38:40.827
And so we got together, some of us, and gave that to him for our first day.

38:42.749 --> 38:43.850
These are great.

38:43.870 --> 38:45.392
I take a lot of pictures, if you don't mind.

38:47.245 --> 38:55.157
Well, I certainly would not have been wearing leggings if I'd have known my... But it's cutting right here.

38:56.479 --> 39:00.244
I'm not wearing... The leggings aren't showing up in the picture.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.105
Oh, that's all right.

39:01.686 --> 39:05.532
If they did, if we... Oh, that's a beautiful picture right there.

39:06.533 --> 39:08.556
Well, look your hand up just as you were talking it up.

39:08.697 --> 39:09.658
Because you know why there's some...

39:10.195 --> 39:15.343
There's some wonderful light coming in that we're going to capture here.

39:15.363 --> 39:17.906
I'm just going to try this one over there.

39:17.947 --> 39:21.472
Oh, I'm going to shoot these available light.

39:21.492 --> 39:26.619
Oh, that's wonderful.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.681
That's wonderful.

39:28.724 --> 39:29.846
Excellent.

39:29.866 --> 39:35.313
Well, you're the kind of photographer you take enough pictures so at least one of them has to come out.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.596
And I don't take two hours to do it either.

39:37.776 --> 39:38.437
No, you don't.

39:38.457 --> 39:42.623
There are people who come in from Vanity Fair and I've published my photographs.

39:43.704 --> 39:48.070
I'm looking for one really lovely picture, you know, like that with the prisms right there.

39:48.090 --> 39:50.053
Are we got a copy of this to give you?

39:51.575 --> 39:56.942
This is somebody, Irish herself, still worked

39:58.711 --> 40:07.401
as a waitress, fell in love with Emily Dickinson's maid and the groundsmen who were Irish.

40:09.304 --> 40:21.478
So she went to Amherst, gathered a crew, took them on a walking tour of where they'd lived, plus, of course, the cemetery that's

40:21.863 --> 40:24.326
I guess 18 miles away.

40:24.407 --> 40:27.191
They couldn't be buried where the Dickensons were buried.

40:27.932 --> 40:33.580
And she made this book for the people who now work in the Emily Dickinson house.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.944
She hand-shows this, The Art of Service.

40:37.004 --> 40:39.428
She had them write what they do.

40:40.169 --> 40:41.691
Here's the woman who cleans.

40:42.652 --> 40:48.681
And she asked them if there was any way that they felt it was, you know, like a work of art.

40:49.370 --> 40:54.257
And this one didn't say that, but this one did.

40:54.337 --> 40:59.826
It is like art or poetry, and that you do it to the best of your ability, and it's what your passion and love is.

40:59.846 --> 41:03.451
Speaking of, she gave all of them these books.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.435
Carpenter, Cap... Carpenter, Maker.

41:06.455 --> 41:07.497
Carpenter, Maker.

41:07.557 --> 41:15.749
The job resembles art or poetry in some of the fabrication and blending in of mothing to match or make it look like others.

41:16.350 --> 41:18.313
The landscape technician...

41:18.918 --> 41:21.784
You know, speaking of photography.

41:21.805 --> 41:23.208
And who's the woman who did this again?

41:24.009 --> 41:25.954
Her name is Aoife Murray.

41:26.976 --> 41:29.943
I'll be glad to see Rox and Samuel.

41:29.963 --> 41:31.346
K-I-F-E-M-U-R-R-A-Y.

41:31.526 --> 41:38.462
And she has four of my Emily Dickinson volumes now because...

41:38.999 --> 41:42.102
She got a Jack Olsen labor scholarship.

41:42.122 --> 41:44.384
That's what we did after Jack died.

41:44.404 --> 41:46.185
It was mostly his family.

41:46.226 --> 41:48.888
That is on his side.

41:49.088 --> 41:57.095
We had some money, and they set up the scholarship at San Francisco State for somebody who had taken some classes.

41:57.376 --> 41:58.517
The sunlight is beautiful.

41:58.597 --> 41:59.537
If you don't mind.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.921
That's wonderful.

42:08.686 --> 42:09.006
Great.

42:09.340 --> 42:17.468
So, and then she saved enough money to go to Amherst, finally, and look at all the places.

42:18.189 --> 42:23.614
And the newspaper says 100 came, but the curator counted 140.

42:24.395 --> 42:29.841
Anyhow, over 40 of the crowd were the direct descendants of Tom Kelly.

42:29.901 --> 42:30.942
I'll send you a copy.

42:30.962 --> 42:32.043
Very nice.

42:32.343 --> 42:34.285
In fact, anyhow...

42:34.602 --> 42:37.145
also participating and honored on the tour.

42:37.225 --> 42:38.226
That's what she's like.

42:38.266 --> 42:43.231
We're the men and women who currently clean and maintain the Dickinson Homestead House and grounds.

42:43.812 --> 42:51.740
In fact, I asked them to write about their jobs, and I made hand-sewn books with their writing, titled Art of Service.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.162
And anyhow, so they all... You know who I interviewed?

42:54.923 --> 42:56.284
Isn't that a wonderful story?

42:56.304 --> 42:58.106
Who you'd love for this?

42:58.126 --> 42:59.808
I interviewed for this new book.

43:00.489 --> 43:01.690
It was Murray Sendak.

43:02.176 --> 43:03.417
Oh, yes.

43:03.677 --> 43:06.079
Maurice is a lot like yourself in many respects.

43:06.099 --> 43:07.441
You know, he never went to college.

43:08.542 --> 43:09.743
He's totally the product.

43:09.783 --> 43:12.025
And he is so... It made me think of it.

43:12.765 --> 43:15.988
How did you feel when you went into Emily Dickinson's house?

43:16.008 --> 43:20.172
Was there any kind of a communion that you felt with her when you went into the homestead?

43:20.712 --> 43:23.995
Well, it was strange.

43:24.015 --> 43:30.681
They have on display, they have her white dress, and it's kind of on a...

43:31.572 --> 43:39.644
When I first went there, they had it on a kind of a dummy, you know, like what you sew on.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.830
Last time it was on a hanger.

43:43.870 --> 43:45.412
I don't know what made the change.

43:45.472 --> 43:49.478
Maybe the new faculty people who lived in the house there.

43:50.600 --> 43:59.453
But I was troubled by the fact that I felt it was really sacred why they had her

43:59.720 --> 44:04.505
her writing desk where she had it and her chair there by the window.

44:04.605 --> 44:15.096
And you looked out, of course, there have been some houses that have been built since, but still it's pretty much the same, a one or two-story place.

44:15.116 --> 44:17.598
So you see the pine or a valley.

44:17.838 --> 44:22.924
I mean, beyond that, you see the old, I thought about that view.

44:22.944 --> 44:29.170
I was sad that it wasn't the same trees that were probably there when she was there.

44:29.943 --> 44:38.552
They have this, as I said, in her colors, because Barbara did too.

44:39.693 --> 44:57.250
Barbara gave me one of those, because I took her to the Emily Dickinson room, and we looked at the sewing fascicles, and at the bottom in that dresser drawer, because they have her dresser.

44:57.635 --> 45:00.899
in the bottom are her herbarium.

45:01.440 --> 45:08.750
Those girls who were the aristocracy of Amherst, you know, they would go out in the fields.

45:08.830 --> 45:23.389
It was the time when Linnaeus was publishing articles in the Atlantic Monthly, and they would go out and they would pick flowers, and they would press them, and then they would write down the Latin name, but Emily was different.

45:23.926 --> 45:33.898
She did write down the Latin name, but she also writes down the popular name, the name that people in Amherst called them by who didn't have the other language.

45:34.038 --> 45:36.481
She was very young at the time.

45:36.581 --> 45:39.244
When did you first discover Emily Dickinson?

45:40.806 --> 45:44.050
Well, I read her first in anthologies.

45:44.170 --> 45:46.913
You know, I got a lot out of anthologies.

45:46.954 --> 45:49.917
The Untermyer Anthology.

45:49.957 --> 45:53.241
There was a later Harriet Monroe one.

45:53.474 --> 45:57.498
And those books would often appear, by the way, in secondhand stores.

45:59.701 --> 46:01.403
Maybe they were used as text.

46:01.423 --> 46:02.023
I don't know.

46:02.063 --> 46:03.805
You know, maybe you had to buy them.

46:03.825 --> 46:06.128
Was it something immediate, though, when you discovered her?

46:06.228 --> 46:07.469
I mean, is this?

46:07.549 --> 46:12.094
Well, they never published her complete poetry in the beginning, you know.

46:12.855 --> 46:16.459
But I began to read everything.

46:16.820 --> 46:20.764
And then, of course, when the letters came out,

46:21.166 --> 46:29.819
and the complete poems, and the letters contained those beautiful fragments, if you've ever read the fragments.

46:29.839 --> 46:34.385
I have a copy of the faxicals, actually, the Harvard, you know, the... Yes, uh-huh.

46:34.405 --> 46:35.567
Which is quite wonderful.

46:35.587 --> 46:38.371
Yes, well, I know it was put out that way.

46:38.411 --> 46:43.859
And then the accident of meeting Theodora Ward, that was so wonderful.

46:43.939 --> 46:50.008
But, well, she's often...

46:51.052 --> 46:57.081
often on my lips or quoted in a letter.

46:57.121 --> 47:03.210
When you talk about the printed book or the book, for her, the book really is not a printed book.

47:03.270 --> 47:05.894
It goes back to her.

47:06.435 --> 47:06.715
Of course.

47:06.735 --> 47:08.077
Of course.

47:08.158 --> 47:09.700
She wanted to be published.

47:10.681 --> 47:12.644
She wanted desperately to be published.

47:12.664 --> 47:17.852
I mean, her poems about fame, well, are heartbreaking.

47:18.592 --> 47:21.035
That's one of the great, you know.

47:21.055 --> 47:22.457
But she was not of her time.

47:22.477 --> 47:23.839
I mean, she speaks to us.

47:24.440 --> 47:28.325
Well, as I said, let me take a second.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.006
I think I know.

47:29.486 --> 47:43.204
Maybe I don't know where the... We're next to nothing, because these are my... I was pressing autumn leaves at the time.

47:43.384 --> 47:45.087
This is when I was first in the East.

47:45.487 --> 47:48.531
This is his library of poetry and songs.

47:49.085 --> 47:49.826
Whose library?

47:49.886 --> 47:50.127
What?

47:50.788 --> 47:51.449
Whose library?

47:52.590 --> 47:53.271
Uh, Bryant.

47:53.291 --> 47:53.652
Oh, Bryant.

47:53.672 --> 47:55.555
William Cullen Bryant.

47:55.575 --> 47:55.955
Oh, sorry.

47:55.995 --> 47:59.441
Memoir of him, and this is a reprint of this book.

47:59.661 --> 48:00.302
Look at this.

48:00.322 --> 48:13.742
This book isn't quite... But you see, you look at this, but you don't see anything that would, you know, that would, who would even have a, have a, have a published her...

48:14.212 --> 48:23.786
Well, here's, believe me, if all those in very young terms, just something from a library to borrow books, copy information, anything for a bookmark.

48:23.846 --> 48:30.255
Now you have those lovely things that you can print in, but you read why these, why these... Look at these leaves.

48:30.355 --> 48:31.877
Are these Massachusetts leaves?

48:32.659 --> 48:37.005
They were, they were probably Massachusetts leaves.

48:37.646 --> 48:42.733
See, I'm surprised even, I haven't looked in this, but it's interesting how

48:43.237 --> 48:59.697
the different things, but, you know, if you read this, I'm telling you, she was, well, this, of course, is Tennyson in here, but by and large, it's not what, oh.

49:01.400 --> 49:10.611
Look at all the book parks, all the, you really use your books, don't you?

49:11.384 --> 49:14.529
I had a wonderful time at McDowell every once.

49:14.769 --> 49:19.977
I was there for a terrible winter, and every morning I would read thorough.

49:20.858 --> 49:24.183
Oh, this messy room.

49:29.751 --> 49:31.393
This is his journals.

49:31.413 --> 49:33.857
And look at all the bookmarks, the marks you have in there.

49:33.877 --> 49:34.177
Yes, indeed.

49:34.197 --> 49:35.139
All of these books have been great.

49:35.159 --> 49:39.585
And this, by the way, you can see went through the fire, but it wasn't right where the...

49:40.122 --> 49:42.828
Books everywhere, all with lots of money.

49:42.848 --> 49:44.411
Well, books in every single room.

49:44.431 --> 49:46.356
That's the journal of Henry D. Fuller.

49:46.656 --> 49:50.144
Here's the Comrade in Illustrated Social Monthly.

49:50.224 --> 49:57.039
It's also very, very, very fascinating book.

49:57.740 --> 49:58.502
Anyhow...

49:58.921 --> 50:04.847
Very disorganized, except I know where everything is, so they're not really disorganized.

50:04.867 --> 50:05.587
It's all up here.

50:05.888 --> 50:06.709
I know what you're saying.

50:06.889 --> 50:10.913
Yeah, and pictures of writers I love.

50:10.953 --> 50:12.214
Can you name some of them for me?

50:12.674 --> 50:15.737
Well, how many can you name by looking at them?

50:16.738 --> 50:21.082
There are some personal ones here, too, and a few that flipped over.

50:21.162 --> 50:23.345
You certainly know who that is.

50:23.365 --> 50:24.586
Well, of course, of course.

50:24.606 --> 50:25.907
That's Walt Whitman, and that's...

50:26.461 --> 50:32.086
Speaking of someone who never had college... That is Virginia, of course.

50:32.106 --> 50:33.147
Yes, indeed.

50:34.168 --> 50:34.309
Uh-huh.

50:36.170 --> 50:37.852
That's not Jane Austen, of course.

50:37.872 --> 50:41.576
Well, this is one of the... We were talking about her.

50:41.596 --> 50:42.677
One of the Bronte sisters.

50:42.697 --> 50:43.297
That's right.

50:43.317 --> 50:45.580
And someone who wrote about them.

50:49.123 --> 50:50.304
Um... Gaskell.

50:50.364 --> 50:51.005
Elizabeth Gaskell.

50:51.065 --> 50:52.867
Oh, that's Elizabeth Gaskell.

50:52.887 --> 50:53.227
She's famous.

50:53.367 --> 50:53.487
Yeah.

50:53.507 --> 50:53.647
Uh-huh.

50:53.667 --> 50:56.350
This is someone I love very much.

50:56.937 --> 51:00.121
Have you read Pat Barker's trilogy?

51:00.422 --> 51:01.403
No.

51:01.423 --> 51:07.150
You have to read Regeneration, The Eye on the Door.

51:08.292 --> 51:09.233
It's a trilogy.

51:09.934 --> 51:11.276
It's a literary trilogy.

51:11.316 --> 51:11.596
Pat Barker.

51:11.656 --> 51:13.098
It's also a historical one.

51:13.118 --> 51:14.480
Well, I don't have that book.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.282
You know who this is?

51:16.302 --> 51:18.185
That's Emerson over there.

51:18.265 --> 51:19.827
That gentleman I don't know.

51:20.208 --> 51:20.728
I should know.

51:21.309 --> 51:22.491
This is William Blake.

51:22.671 --> 51:23.572
That's William Blake.

51:23.932 --> 51:24.413
Yeah.

51:24.578 --> 51:25.679
One of my great heroes.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.602
Yeah, mine too.

51:28.003 --> 51:28.724
Mine too.

51:28.784 --> 51:31.507
It was just a wonderful biography you've been written about him.

51:31.527 --> 51:32.529
Well, I have it.

51:32.769 --> 51:33.410
It's wonderful.

51:33.951 --> 51:36.013
My wife read it and basically read it to me.

51:36.474 --> 51:38.517
And the illustrations in it are fantastic.

51:38.657 --> 51:40.459
It's a wonderful, wonderful book.

51:40.479 --> 51:40.720
Fantastic.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.262
Yes, I spent money for it.

51:42.282 --> 51:44.124
That's Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

51:44.144 --> 51:44.905
You know who this is.

51:45.246 --> 51:45.927
I can't see it.

51:46.608 --> 51:47.629
That's Keats.

51:47.829 --> 51:48.590
Oh, that's Keats.

51:48.690 --> 51:49.652
Poor John Keats.

51:49.812 --> 51:50.974
That's the death vest.

51:51.674 --> 51:54.298
Maury Sendak has a death mask of Keats.

51:54.464 --> 51:56.447
Oh, yes, and there's Emily.

51:56.487 --> 52:09.906
There's that one photograph of her with the scratches that are in the dagger attack.

52:11.208 --> 52:13.131
You listen to a lot of music, I gather.

52:13.151 --> 52:14.753
That's sound, by the way, was it?

52:14.773 --> 52:16.596
Well, it isn't only music.

52:16.636 --> 52:24.167
We have a very rich couple of radio stations here, and there are a lot of writers, interviews, and

52:24.383 --> 52:30.669
and so forth and so on, and here's, like everybody, their favorite.

52:32.071 --> 52:34.553
I've got to take a picture of those books the way they are.

52:34.633 --> 52:35.294
This is what?

52:36.055 --> 52:40.159
I've got to take a picture of those books, if you don't mind.

52:40.179 --> 52:41.240
That is priceless.

52:41.380 --> 52:42.782
That's unbelievably good.

52:43.022 --> 52:44.643
This is the desk of a reader.

52:45.364 --> 52:45.584
Wow.

52:52.011 --> 52:53.192
Oh, this is...

52:54.185 --> 52:55.106
Oops, watch it now.

52:56.307 --> 52:57.108
I don't want to break anything.

52:58.670 --> 53:01.853
See, there's Kate and Shelley.

53:02.074 --> 53:10.703
My daughter is having a book come out next month, and my granddaughter, we just had a book party.

53:11.704 --> 53:18.792
Her book is entirely different, but this is... And that's made in America?

53:19.332 --> 53:19.773
Yes.

53:19.793 --> 53:20.734
Immigrant students.

53:20.754 --> 53:23.837
Very, very...

53:24.661 --> 53:26.905
I want to get another picture of this.

53:28.427 --> 53:29.489
God, I didn't know.

53:29.509 --> 53:31.673
It's slightly embarrassing.

53:31.713 --> 53:33.055
No, it's not, because I have a chance.

53:33.075 --> 53:33.536
It's a mess.

53:33.556 --> 53:34.237
Everything's a mess.

53:34.257 --> 53:36.781
I'm writing about readers, though, in their books, you see.

53:36.821 --> 53:37.823
Yes, I see.

53:37.843 --> 53:39.325
Well, all right.

53:39.345 --> 53:42.551
That's a great, great picture.

53:42.771 --> 53:43.733
There's your typewriter.

53:44.775 --> 53:47.479
Well, if you're going to take...

53:54.648 --> 53:55.549
Oh, that's great.

53:55.569 --> 53:56.351
That's wonderful.

53:56.371 --> 53:58.013
I can't tell you how much I enjoy this.

53:58.754 --> 53:59.836
I don't know if you don't mind.

54:00.096 --> 54:00.637
You'll call the writers.

54:02.680 --> 54:10.533
Well, see, there's that big hole where Aoife Murray borrowed the rest of the letters.

54:13.978 --> 54:16.081
These are some of the most exciting pictures I've taken.

54:16.181 --> 54:22.071
This is one of my most favoritest books in the world.

54:22.091 --> 54:23.052
Do you want to point to it again?

54:23.251 --> 54:24.953
Would you point to it again?

54:24.973 --> 54:25.714
Let us now praise.

54:25.734 --> 54:26.955
Oh, would you point to it?

54:26.975 --> 54:31.340
Now put your finger right on it, like you were right on the spine.

54:31.360 --> 54:37.847
Yeah, the paperback has got most of the little inserts in it, because I take that with me.

54:37.887 --> 54:39.869
That is one of my very favorite books.

54:39.889 --> 54:40.110
Over here.

54:40.350 --> 54:42.332
I have a first edition of that book.

54:42.352 --> 54:42.652
Do you?

54:42.672 --> 54:43.333
Yes.

54:43.353 --> 54:43.994
Oh.

54:44.014 --> 54:46.156
I have all of aging, everything we ever did.

54:46.196 --> 54:47.418
And you know who this is?

54:48.038 --> 54:49.059
It's Albert.

54:49.079 --> 54:49.180
What?

54:49.520 --> 54:51.122
That's Albert Camus, no?

54:51.142 --> 54:52.143
Yes.

54:52.163 --> 54:52.603
Yes.

54:52.623 --> 54:53.224
Where are the...

54:54.048 --> 54:55.791
We're just a few months apart.

54:55.831 --> 55:08.970
He was a member of the Young Communist League when I was a member of the Young Communist League, but the only other resemblance, I do revere him, most of all for his journals.

55:09.731 --> 55:11.213
You've probably never read them.

55:11.493 --> 55:12.515
I read all of Communism.

55:12.535 --> 55:20.647
This, by the way, was the first Emily Dickinson book of poetry, and I... That right, Tina.

55:21.368 --> 55:21.608
Take it out.

55:22.010 --> 55:24.013
Look at that.

55:24.033 --> 55:25.615
You're holding your Dickinson right now.

55:26.336 --> 55:36.951
Well, across the deaf is on the pain.

55:39.515 --> 55:44.862
Well, anyhow, Thomas Hardy is another one of my very beloved

55:47.288 --> 55:50.431
writers, but most of all for his poetry.

55:50.571 --> 55:53.534
How about one picture of you just standing?

55:53.554 --> 55:54.575
See, here's .

55:55.896 --> 55:56.957
Here's .

56:00.000 --> 56:02.423
Well, I've never been so photographed, sir.

56:04.625 --> 56:05.386
Well, this is exciting.

56:07.367 --> 56:13.093
I'm with a real writer that I respect and admire, and you give me so generously of your time.

56:14.322 --> 56:15.503
And it's free.

56:15.603 --> 56:19.508
And yes, and you have to call your wife and kids.

56:19.528 --> 56:20.629
Ah, that's okay.

56:21.911 --> 56:22.992
They know I'm working.

56:24.794 --> 56:27.517
You can say it was all that woman's fault.

56:27.757 --> 56:36.667
No, I left and I crossed the border to Mexico for an abortion, but I was never out of the country otherwise until I was 80 years old.

56:36.808 --> 56:37.248
Come on.

56:39.070 --> 56:41.813
You were never out of the United States until 80.

56:43.295 --> 56:43.435
Mm-hmm.

56:43.853 --> 56:44.414
Why?

56:45.375 --> 56:52.843
Well, for years it would have been pretty impossible.

56:52.883 --> 56:56.387
You know, I was a mother and a grandma.

56:56.967 --> 57:13.185
I had quite an age range in my kids, too, and then it never seemed to be the time between writing or other such matters, and finally

57:13.503 --> 57:20.412
And a few years later, well, I went to England.

57:20.752 --> 57:25.378
I was invited to England and to Sweden and Norway originally.

57:25.779 --> 57:26.560
So I went.

57:27.381 --> 57:32.908
And then I went on my own with Jack.

57:33.449 --> 57:42.801
And then I went back again when I was invited for various things.

57:43.237 --> 57:45.940
So much of the world I want to see.

57:46.760 --> 57:54.348
But I went to China in 1984 in the women writers' delegation, and that was fascinating.

57:54.488 --> 58:02.616
And then that same year, I got an invitation from the Soviet Union, who published Yanandiyo, by the way.

58:02.656 --> 58:08.862
And they were going to publish Life in the Iron Mills.

58:09.322 --> 58:12.265
They may have, but I never saw it if they did.

58:13.088 --> 58:15.411
They weren't interested in telling me a riddle.

58:17.013 --> 58:23.762
And that was fascinating, too, especially as Jack spoke some German and some Russian.

58:24.764 --> 58:27.547
And there were a lot of Germans who were there.

58:28.769 --> 58:34.016
But anyway, I haven't seen much of the world with my body.

58:34.036 --> 58:37.741
Oh, yeah.

58:37.841 --> 58:38.662
Two books, then.

58:38.782 --> 58:42.387
Books have allowed you to travel the world, haven't they?

58:42.502 --> 59:10.686
oh yes but not the world not enough of the world and uh every year i say well this year i'm going to go oh god look at my blank i don't know why i never brought a good blank but see here's that wonderful blank your wife was reading yeah yeah i brought that you see oh no this is about something else but these are pieces of paper see i've learned to

59:11.037 --> 59:15.221
I have things I can put in, but I was so fascinated.

59:15.241 --> 59:16.102
That's a great book.

59:16.323 --> 59:18.445
He was quite a reader as well, you see.

59:19.366 --> 59:22.910
He taught himself Italian so he could illustrate Dante.

59:23.790 --> 59:26.013
But his wife was illiterate.

59:26.033 --> 59:27.935
He never taught her to read and write.

59:27.955 --> 59:29.436
That's interesting, isn't it?

59:29.456 --> 59:34.682
Now, Tolstoy wanted his wife to read so she could be his secretary and his bookkeeper.

59:35.017 --> 59:40.825
Well, yes, but she was a reader anyway.

59:40.865 --> 59:43.388
She was quite an accomplished woman.

59:43.408 --> 59:44.830
Well, she was educated.

59:44.850 --> 59:46.011
She was educated.

59:46.071 --> 59:54.342
And although she was very young, the aristocracy did give their daughters some education.

59:58.127 --> 01:00:01.652
I'd love to talk with you about Tolstoy sometime.

01:00:01.672 --> 01:00:02.593
I love Tolstoy.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.405
Ah, and a lot of the other writers I liked.

01:00:06.425 --> 01:00:07.687
Next trip, next time I come out.

01:00:07.747 --> 01:00:09.290
This is a wonderful writer.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:12.535
Eduardo, yes, yes, yes.

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:14.358
You may not know.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:17.523
And I love James Kelman, the Scotch guy.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:18.244
I interviewed him.

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:19.286
You did?

01:00:19.306 --> 01:00:20.447
I met him and interviewed him.

01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:21.789
Fascinating.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.153
Well, I do a weekly literary column, you know.

01:00:24.173 --> 01:00:24.554
I didn't know that.

01:00:24.574 --> 01:00:25.415
Well, it's not out here.

01:00:25.495 --> 01:00:26.958
And so how was he?

01:00:27.198 --> 01:00:27.639
Wonderful.

01:00:27.919 --> 01:00:29.121
I'll send you the story.

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.996
I'd love to read it.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:38.183
He wrote me a fan letter when I was published in Britain years ago.
