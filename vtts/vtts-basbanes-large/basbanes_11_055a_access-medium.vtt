00:03.271 --> 00:18.356
I have two chapters, by the way, in this new book, titled, in fact, Continuum 1.

00:18.637 --> 00:21.902
Continuum 2 will be the future.

00:22.503 --> 00:24.807
This is a bachelor's question, but...

00:25.360 --> 00:28.326
Are you listening to my talk this afternoon?

00:28.406 --> 00:43.114
That's really the occasion that I will not bore you with my late afternoon thoughts on this subject.

00:43.134 --> 00:45.478
But everybody who is concerned with

00:46.859 --> 00:48.061
The book is artifact.

00:48.081 --> 00:53.052
It's necessarily also concerned with the book as intellectual construct.

00:54.254 --> 00:58.302
Because no matter what you collect, no matter what you're interested in, you're going to want new books on the subject.

00:58.342 --> 01:00.487
You're going to want new information.

01:00.507 --> 01:01.088
What are you going to do?

01:01.108 --> 01:03.874
Stop using the telephone book because it's in electronic form?

01:03.894 --> 01:04.615
That's absurd.

01:05.219 --> 01:13.844
You have to get information where you can find it, and usually you're just grateful that you can get it in any form.

01:13.864 --> 01:20.342
You have no choice in the matter if the only copy of what you need within 1,500 miles is a microphone.

01:21.757 --> 01:31.707
self-indulgent beyond permission as a scholar to concern yourself beyond a certain extent with the package that the information comes in.

01:31.887 --> 01:35.230
Now, the package you're studying is a different question.

01:35.310 --> 01:49.924
I don't want to study watermarks under glass, but anybody who's active in any intellectual pursuit is right up there at the library terminal,

01:51.052 --> 01:57.442
consulting the, quote, card catalog, unquote, because the card catalog died.

01:57.662 --> 01:59.445
Do you lament its passing?

01:59.545 --> 02:00.406
Not a bit.

02:01.768 --> 02:07.897
I sit in my terminal, as you sit in your terminal, and I have nothing better to do.

02:07.917 --> 02:14.026
I access 150 catalogs of the libraries I like best.

02:14.046 --> 02:18.493
And, well, in my day, I'm doing an exhibition

02:19.503 --> 02:23.907
this summer.

02:23.927 --> 02:28.191
This is the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Book Arts Press.

02:29.152 --> 02:36.720
And the exhibition is called the teaching resources of the Book Arts Press.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.783
I'll come to that.

02:39.963 --> 02:40.864
Well, great.

02:40.944 --> 02:45.088
It will be up during the

02:45.625 --> 02:49.453
four weeks of our book school and a long ways before and after.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.516
That's this summer?

02:50.556 --> 02:55.246
Right, it'll be up from the beginning of June until the middle of September.

02:55.366 --> 02:58.673
Somebody send me a notice, do you think?

02:59.918 --> 03:06.687
I noticed somebody will kindly say, if you'll kindly give me a card to remind me of that.

03:06.707 --> 03:07.388
Oh, sure.

03:19.705 --> 03:24.492
And one of the things I need

03:26.108 --> 03:31.990
for the exhibition is two copies of the Dover Dory Bible Gallery.

03:32.672 --> 03:37.671
Two copies because I have a million copies of the original, but I'm taking

03:38.056 --> 03:46.309
I sat on the road to give a workshop that helped me to the Utah Library Association Rare Book Group in May.

03:46.469 --> 03:49.253
Is that in Salt Lake City?

03:49.273 --> 03:49.954
Yes.

03:50.215 --> 03:51.597
They take my call.

03:52.338 --> 04:06.460
For reasons that I'll explain in a minute, I'm teaching process identification to 80 people.

04:07.992 --> 04:24.635
And I'm doing it with real examples, which means taking real prints out of books or wherever they come from, damaged copies, and encapsulating them in mylar, not all the way around, but just as if it were a transparent file holder.

04:24.715 --> 04:27.339
Just take a big piece of polyester and fold it once.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.827
The static electricity holds whatever it is inside beautifully, and you can see it.

04:32.847 --> 04:37.493
But you can lift up and feel the texture if you want to without further ado.

04:37.473 --> 04:55.938
So I've been carrying up sets of 40 examples of wood cut, wood engraving, steel engraving, chalk manner lithograph, transfer lithograph, polytype, really half-term aquitin photography are the 19th century processes.

04:55.958 --> 05:02.147
And each person in the workshop is going to have a collection of about 30 credits, each two people.

05:03.629 --> 05:05.792
And what are these people studying?

05:06.025 --> 05:14.220
They are librarians and book salaries and such who want to know the difference between one print and another.

05:16.244 --> 05:27.325
For personal pleasure, because conservators and librarians ought to know what's going to happen to something when they put it under water.

05:29.161 --> 05:37.128
some indication of the value, intellectually and financially, in various processes at various times.

05:37.268 --> 05:44.815
But one of my factors is wood engravings, in fact they're electrotypes, of wood engravings from the Dori Bible.

05:46.177 --> 05:52.683
But I want everybody to have not only an original print, I want them to have a photolithographic reproduction of it.

05:52.783 --> 05:57.447
And since Dover prints on both sides, I need two copies so I can rip them off.

05:58.068 --> 06:02.832
So at 4 o'clock this morning, I called up Amazon.com.

06:02.992 --> 06:06.215
Those copies will be in Charlottesville waiting for me on Monday.

06:07.036 --> 06:09.418
Now, I lived in New York for 29 years.

06:09.999 --> 06:14.363
If I wanted the Dover, I could go down to Varick Street and get one.

06:14.383 --> 06:16.885
Or stop off at any of 50 bookstores along the way.

06:16.905 --> 06:18.346
But what do you do in Charlottesville?

06:19.507 --> 06:22.350
Go to a bookstore and order it, no problem.

06:22.370 --> 06:23.912
But I can do that too, and I did.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.674
So there's the continuum.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.103
I needed the book.

06:29.123 --> 06:34.196
I needed it for purposes having only to do with the identification of 19th century prints.

06:34.818 --> 06:39.570
These are the wonderful things that we have from computers.

06:39.590 --> 06:42.317
I've been to Cornell, for instance, for this

06:42.888 --> 06:47.596
They're digitizing books, indeed they are, and the Redoubtable Lamb.

06:48.056 --> 07:02.179
And not only are they digitizing books, but they are a mandate from their Board of Trustees to reduce their collection on campus from 6.8 million to 6 million by the year 2000.

07:02.159 --> 07:07.888
Obviously, their agenda includes the print book.

07:08.168 --> 07:09.370
We have still a lot of books.

07:09.390 --> 07:11.573
That does not mean getting rid of 800,000 books.

07:11.594 --> 07:15.700
It means getting rid of twice that many because of normal accessions coming in.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.222
That's right.

07:17.583 --> 07:21.028
And then, while I was there, just to go into that ultimus,

07:21.008 --> 07:28.342
Maybe they take me up, but I wish the heck I had my camera with you, but they are scanning things.

07:28.402 --> 07:29.885
They're scanning archives.

07:29.905 --> 07:32.871
They're scanning the letter books of those in Cornell.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.035
Just as so happens while I'm there.

07:35.386 --> 07:48.120
Now, they have made a determination that only the content matters, because these are not his letters.

07:48.140 --> 07:51.103
They're the letters that is out calling letters written by some secretary.

07:51.123 --> 07:51.743
So they're scanning them.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.885
And then the originals are being disclosed on.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.126
Now, how do you respond to something like that?

07:54.146 --> 07:56.108
Is that something that is unique?

08:00.112 --> 08:00.713
It's not clear.

08:00.733 --> 08:02.575
Two ways.

08:02.555 --> 08:09.024
One the opposite of the other.

08:09.104 --> 08:25.025
No reason why you wouldn't know, but you just might know that the Lucas Press has an annual Valentine in the shape of the big posters.

08:25.045 --> 08:29.271
Well, one year it was, change is neither merciful nor just.

08:31.023 --> 08:54.010
That's what Cornell's letters book, which I presume, looks like seven volumes, but they're copies made under pressure of the originals on tissue.

08:55.340 --> 09:10.900
And the paper wasn't very good when it was made.

09:10.920 --> 09:21.013
So in 150 years, 150 years has not helped.

09:21.033 --> 09:21.954
Choose one.

09:21.974 --> 09:25.018
Don't make surrogates of the originals and watch themselves distraught.

09:25.038 --> 09:25.178
Or two.

09:26.288 --> 09:31.861
make surrogates of the originals and throw away the originals.

09:32.262 --> 09:38.817
And don't talk to me about three, both, because it's too expensive.

09:38.837 --> 09:42.205
And they will tell you the process of making the copy

09:43.518 --> 09:47.843
It really requires dilating the volume so they can get a good copy.

09:47.963 --> 10:03.342
My impression when I went up to this room, I saw a lot of old, basically, just fillet.

10:03.362 --> 10:06.285
It's so people, we say what we can.

10:06.991 --> 10:13.740
But if you can't walk, how?

10:14.101 --> 10:20.810
So this is a practical necessity that you do have to script your books and don't have to.

10:21.270 --> 10:32.926
Well, the faculty speaking, probably, if you had, you can tell yourself that if you have real stamina, you just go out and raise the money and do both.

10:33.026 --> 10:34.348
But on the break, you've got

10:35.054 --> 10:45.874
6,799,000 other books, many hundreds of thousands of which

10:46.816 --> 10:52.003
are clamoring for attention.

10:52.023 --> 10:58.152
Are you familiar with a phrase called phased deterioration?

10:58.252 --> 11:01.977
Not a bit of phased deterioration.

11:02.157 --> 11:05.281
I've certainly heard of phased conservation.

11:05.301 --> 11:11.790
Phased deterioration means that's a fact that has been formalized.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.494
And John Cole heard of it at the Library of Congress.

11:15.048 --> 11:18.554
This is another phrase I picked up before now.

11:18.574 --> 11:21.139
Basically, the decision has been made.

11:21.239 --> 11:24.545
I'm not passing any judgment at all.

11:24.565 --> 11:25.226
I'm not reporting.

11:25.246 --> 11:29.373
We're talking about book culture and the way things are going.

11:29.393 --> 11:30.475
This is what I'm looking at.

11:31.788 --> 11:39.621
Certain books have made the determination that certain books will not take any heroic efforts to rely on them.

11:39.641 --> 11:46.052
And so they're going to make them as comfortable as they can, give them a little bit of reasonable.

11:46.092 --> 11:48.837
But there is a point at which, of course, you can't intervene.

11:48.937 --> 11:51.762
That's why it's called phase deterioration.

11:51.862 --> 11:54.707
I mean, you do pass a certain point, I guess, where...

11:55.126 --> 12:05.456
reclaiming the book, or restoring it, or deacidifying it, is not only relatively expensive, but actually practically impossible.

12:05.476 --> 12:11.102
So that happens, obviously.

12:11.722 --> 12:12.163
No, sure.

12:13.004 --> 12:14.025
This is great.

12:14.505 --> 12:21.572
Your realism quotient has to be in working order here, if you're going to get through the day in the Westside Carmel or any other large library.

12:22.649 --> 12:31.146
The New York Public for years has been taking in new pamphlets and filming them and throwing them away on the spot, brand new stuff.

12:33.130 --> 12:34.032
Yes.

12:34.112 --> 12:39.984
And they're the only place in the country that's got them.

12:40.044 --> 12:41.827
That's got a pamphlet.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.611
It's got the information they contain.

12:44.603 --> 12:50.669
They are the only place that knows that it has them, which is the same thing.

12:50.849 --> 12:58.457
And they throw away the originals, maybe because they have no place to store them.

12:58.477 --> 13:02.041
They throw away the originals because they don't need them.

13:02.061 --> 13:09.889
Because they captured the intellectual context.

13:09.929 --> 13:13.733
Too bad for the writing historians.

13:14.067 --> 13:23.862
Do you have an attitude?

13:25.063 --> 13:28.629
Are you riding that?

13:28.649 --> 13:35.819
We reach a point, obviously, where we can't keep everything.

13:35.839 --> 13:36.721
We reach that point 20 centuries ago.

13:36.741 --> 13:39.385
The world is for the living.

13:39.405 --> 13:41.087
Most people aren't terribly interested in the past.

13:42.215 --> 13:59.775
I say this afternoon we have an obligation.

13:59.795 --> 14:03.840
We cannot use up the past.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.002
We have to.

14:05.022 --> 14:05.342
How do you mean?

14:05.362 --> 14:06.083
What do you mean by that?

14:06.103 --> 14:06.944
We cannot provide the future and the past.

14:06.964 --> 14:09.046
We cannot use up all the natural, physical, and mental resources that have been heard.

14:09.066 --> 14:09.707
Too bad for the kids.

14:14.530 --> 14:23.622
There were 200 copies of the reading book that were printed, there were 50 copies that survived.

14:23.642 --> 14:28.509
It was pretty good for 500 years, but we can't use them all.

14:28.609 --> 14:38.783
It's irresponsible of us as a civilization not to do our part to see that those books get carried on in an unsurrogated format.

14:40.687 --> 15:03.907
to posterity because it's one of the great monuments of Western culture.

15:03.927 --> 15:05.849
But this doesn't mean that I'm going to vote for the salvation of every edition of Little Women.

15:05.869 --> 15:06.870
I already need every edition of every Bible.

15:06.890 --> 15:07.891
I mean, this is a huge example of Gutenberg.

15:07.911 --> 15:09.512
You know, we say it, any copy of a great many editions of the Bible.

15:10.555 --> 15:30.046
Now, again, one hopes that we pass on to our successors enough so that they get a sense of the past and an honest one.

15:30.327 --> 15:36.917
And in questionable areas, we should be as generous as possible.

15:37.336 --> 16:02.145
but historically practically all the conservation money has gone to the top of the market not the bottom you don't have to worry by the end of the 18th century nobody was throwing away portfolios of shakespeare indeed so lovingly were they being considered

16:03.104 --> 16:17.809
Yet Donald Farron, who cataloged the Folger 79 for his folios last year at NDH grant, says that there is not a single untampered wood copy.

16:17.829 --> 16:19.311
Not one.

16:19.391 --> 16:20.854
Every single one of them is the Folger.

16:20.874 --> 16:21.675
At the Folger?

16:22.096 --> 16:22.176
Yep.

16:23.050 --> 16:27.594
By whom do we have any?

16:27.794 --> 16:37.984
By five generations of conservatories and book finders and booksellers.

16:38.004 --> 16:38.484
In what respect?

16:38.504 --> 16:39.085
Improved, perfected.

16:39.105 --> 16:41.207
It's a good copy and it was owned by Garrick.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.228
But the frontispiece is torn.

16:43.288 --> 16:46.832
Let's replace it from a better copy.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.733
The frontispiece title page is torn.

16:48.753 --> 16:50.315
And now one of them is metamedic.

16:50.335 --> 16:52.737
Now he's doing the second and third and fourth folios.

16:52.902 --> 16:57.337
He's almost through the seconds and he says he hasn't gone to Nuntampu second yet either.

16:57.517 --> 17:03.537
Well, as I was saying, that's where all the money goes.

17:03.905 --> 17:18.188
But Worcester, Massachusetts pamphlets of the 1840s, you can be pretty sure, are not porgeries, are not tampered with, and are not preserved.

17:18.448 --> 17:22.795
There are local interests.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.339
There weren't that many produced.

17:25.319 --> 17:35.552
Thank you very much.

17:35.572 --> 17:50.651
There is now a lifted range of interest, and we just hope that three or four societies' operations will keep up with that.

17:50.671 --> 17:51.192
If one is discovered in...

17:51.813 --> 17:59.505
Charlottesville, Virginia, on a subject of interest only to those living in Worcester in the 1840s.

17:59.605 --> 18:01.828
What do you think its chance of survival is?

18:02.409 --> 18:05.374
We're going to throw it away.

18:06.876 --> 18:13.867
If we have stamina, and if we're little enough, we do, then we might do something better than that.

18:14.348 --> 18:19.035
I recently was in touch with Robert Buckeye, who's the Wilbur librarian at Middlebury.

18:19.657 --> 18:30.331
I expressed a terrible copy of a piece of pastoral theology of no interest to us in the bad binding of 1825.

18:30.611 --> 18:42.788
And I wrote him essentially a joke message saying, you know, it's 1825, it was published in Middlebury, your mom, and I cannot believe that you don't have 25 copies of it.

18:42.808 --> 18:44.890
But I'm going to throw it away if you don't want it.

18:44.910 --> 18:45.411
Do you want it?

18:46.471 --> 18:47.793
He wrote that.

18:47.813 --> 18:48.915
He said they'd love to have it.

18:48.935 --> 18:55.385
They have the second edition, 1827, but they don't have the first edition, 1821.

18:55.405 --> 19:00.413
So, the book has gone home to a place where it will be looked after.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.937
Very appropriate.

19:03.117 --> 19:10.369
But it is not realistic to ask me, Book Arts Press, a teaching laboratory, to put this book in with a lot of other books.

19:11.176 --> 19:36.947
to look after literary 1825 printing i will not take that responsibility i will just because i know a lot of people it's very efficient for me to be in touch with the railroad library because i'd like you to know them by email and i'd like you to know their address to send a message off saying do you want something

19:39.222 --> 20:00.860
But I don't know if you can expect how many libraries to do this.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.862
There's something that everybody has to remember.

20:01.882 --> 20:02.283
They're book school.

20:02.303 --> 20:03.084
Church at Columbia.

20:03.104 --> 20:03.525
But it had a problem.

20:03.910 --> 20:26.070
I was prepared to do everything necessary to make your big school good, but I was not willing to take on the problems of the Upper West Side.

20:28.632 --> 20:32.399
You just can't do everything all the time.

20:32.480 --> 20:38.572
Libraries are the trouble they're in.

20:38.592 --> 20:41.798
For a simple reason, I think.

20:43.162 --> 20:49.794
There has to be a sharing between two elements, responsibility and authority.

20:50.054 --> 20:57.287
If somebody is to be responsible for something, then they have to have authority over it.

20:57.307 --> 20:58.589
You can't have it both ways.

20:58.609 --> 21:06.503
You can't tell libraries you're responsible for preserving all this stuff without giving them

21:06.888 --> 21:16.443
the means to do so, and to tell them that they must go raise the means is like telling me to clean up the West Side so I can run their book school.

21:16.463 --> 21:18.646
It's too much responsibility.

21:19.868 --> 21:25.136
It's thrown at an institution that doesn't have the authority to raise that kind of money anymore.

21:25.176 --> 21:27.800
I'm not having the authority to clean up the Upper West Side.

21:27.940 --> 21:31.485
Now you said a lot of trouble that they're in.

21:31.505 --> 21:32.807
I think you like to cover them.

21:32.827 --> 21:34.490
What do you mean by that?

21:34.510 --> 21:35.832
The trouble they've always been in.

21:36.605 --> 21:38.870
Too many books, not enough money.

21:38.890 --> 21:41.475
Do you know about libraries in general?

21:41.495 --> 21:44.381
Not books, libraries specifically.

21:44.401 --> 21:49.050
I'm talking about any research library that has an obligation to an area.

21:49.251 --> 21:53.820
Well, a public library is a convenience operation.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.705
Here's two of them.

21:57.266 --> 22:10.027
Their problems are probably more similar to those of Barnes & Noble than they are to New York public.

22:10.147 --> 22:13.933
You don't mind my jumping around with that.

22:13.953 --> 22:16.197
The reputations of institutions are still

22:16.430 --> 22:43.828
Why be an institution?

22:43.848 --> 22:43.928
Huh?

22:43.948 --> 22:44.609
Because this is likely to change.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.070
Why be an institution?

22:45.674 --> 22:49.225
over the past 25 years, it's good in everything except their library.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.335
It doesn't work that way.

22:52.356 --> 22:56.188
You've got a good faculty, you've got a good campus, you've got a good endowment, you've got a good library.

22:56.629 --> 22:58.435
They all come together.

22:58.820 --> 23:06.511
You can't say you're going to have a good faculty with a bad library.

23:06.531 --> 23:10.457
You can't say you're going to have a good library with a bad faculty.

23:10.477 --> 23:12.019
They try to do everything at once.

23:12.039 --> 23:15.224
You can't specialize that much in academia.

23:15.645 --> 23:16.346
They're encyclopedic operations.

23:16.366 --> 23:18.890
You can't decide if you can have a three-legged table.

23:18.910 --> 23:20.672
You can't have a four-legged table.

23:20.692 --> 23:25.559
You've got to put your resources at good students, good faculty, good physical resources.

23:25.579 --> 23:27.342
That means to support it all.

23:27.322 --> 23:49.702
For example, in nine years, everyone would acknowledge that our university is one of the great American universities.

23:49.722 --> 23:52.565
And yet in nine years, right-hand Gregorian increased the holdings from $2 million to $3 million.

23:52.585 --> 23:53.085
Only he must have had it.

23:53.105 --> 23:53.846
How big did anybody else grow?

23:53.866 --> 23:54.747
And then all the other institutions?

23:54.767 --> 23:55.928
I think all the other leagues are already larger than one.

23:56.313 --> 24:00.956
But what was the percentage of interest throughout the country?

24:00.976 --> 24:02.745
I bet it wasn't anything close enough.

24:03.417 --> 24:12.987
Yeah, that's a 30%.

24:13.788 --> 24:17.532
And I bet Brown lied, too.

24:17.552 --> 24:18.413
Well, why would they lie?

24:18.433 --> 24:24.119
I mean, just let me talk you theoretically now.

24:24.139 --> 24:25.501
Why would they want to put out an important ticket?

24:25.521 --> 24:26.522
Why would it be important to go to a piece of art?

24:27.498 --> 24:51.856
Maybe that goes back to my initial question.

24:51.876 --> 24:53.178
It's certainly still largely the case that Mars better than Mars.

24:53.198 --> 24:53.358
Hold on.

24:53.378 --> 24:53.979
It's not two to three million.

24:53.999 --> 24:54.340
It's interesting.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.001
It's two to three million watts.

24:55.021 --> 24:55.902
In England, there is some competitive lying.

24:57.755 --> 25:14.070
because the granting agencies decided that they would accept giving money to the great research libraries based on the number of holdings they had.

25:14.171 --> 25:21.397
When Oxford Learned and Cambridge was counting individual slip sheet ballots, they said, all right, you sons of bitches.

25:21.417 --> 25:25.762
They began counting their cigar labels individually in the John Johnson collection.

25:25.782 --> 25:26.222
Come on.

25:26.242 --> 25:27.323
Anybody can play this now.

25:28.636 --> 25:50.825
But basically, I can give you a person to talk to about this who does those statistics.

25:50.885 --> 25:52.787
His name is Kendon Stubbs.

25:53.392 --> 26:06.456
Kenton, K-E-N-B-O-N, S-T-U-B-B-S, he's associate librarian, associate director that is, at UVA, a very short name.

26:06.476 --> 26:09.542
He's quiet, don't let it be.

26:10.183 --> 26:12.507
He's associate director.

26:12.527 --> 26:15.653
Did I send you a book on his first guest book?

26:17.388 --> 26:29.639
Maybe we should talk about what the Book Arts Press is, how to have that.

26:29.879 --> 26:34.964
You've got to take care of the function in this field without that book.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.666
It's called Kennedy's Book Arts Press address book.

26:37.686 --> 26:44.492
It's a list of about 25, maybe 3,000 names of people who are active in the book world.

26:44.512 --> 26:44.893
That's what I said.

26:44.913 --> 26:45.353
And you get it.

26:47.510 --> 26:51.455
by being a friend of the book like France, which costs you $30 a year.

26:51.695 --> 26:55.180
My check will be in the mail.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.842
And you get many other things besides.

26:56.862 --> 27:01.888
Well, it's like joining the Friends of the Harvard College Library.

27:01.908 --> 27:05.273
That's the best thing you've ever had.

27:05.293 --> 27:05.653
Oh, isn't it?

27:05.673 --> 27:06.574
Absolutely.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.297
Isn't that amazing?

27:08.317 --> 27:11.020
It's a miracle.

27:11.287 --> 27:26.888
They do a wonderful job.

27:27.870 --> 27:34.138
What I'm saying is that

27:37.156 --> 27:57.708
And anybody mixed up in the preservation of the national patronage is either going to develop a sense of the macabre, or set the risks, because you're going to lose stuff all the time.

27:58.849 --> 28:05.880
A friend of mine was in a play as an undergraduate as Moliere play, under-rehearsed,

28:07.092 --> 28:23.013
and she and the rest of the cast were... They're dropping so many lines, and during performances, I finally said to my friend, Jane, what's it like up there when that happens?

28:23.033 --> 28:23.975
She says, well, you think?

28:23.995 --> 28:25.357
Too bad for the playwright.

28:25.477 --> 28:30.503
And I think, finally, in the library, you think, well, too bad for posterity.

28:31.425 --> 28:34.669
You know, save on the Charlottesville entrance,

28:35.898 --> 28:39.386
The Middlebury infants are going to have to look after themselves.

28:39.506 --> 28:53.957
I won't accept the responsibility for the world's class from then to now because I am not given the authority to do so.

28:54.899 --> 28:59.736
And don't tell me I've got the responsibility when you won't give me the authority.

28:59.756 --> 29:01.743
Don't tell me I've got to do it all.

29:01.763 --> 29:02.245
I'm not Atlas.

29:02.385 --> 29:04.493
I don't do it.

29:05.075 --> 29:06.259
Now look.

29:06.678 --> 29:14.428
That's your typical research library's attitude in spades.

29:15.089 --> 29:21.838
They work hard eight, nine hours a day.

29:21.858 --> 29:22.999
Then they go home.

29:23.119 --> 29:29.327
And in an environment with very limited authority and very great responsibility, it isn't going to work very well.

29:29.347 --> 29:33.673
We should be grateful that it works as well as it does.

29:33.693 --> 29:35.976
And if Cornell decides that they've got this stamina

29:37.542 --> 29:41.406
to digitize Ezra's letterbox.

29:42.187 --> 29:44.009
That is just one example.

29:44.169 --> 29:44.650
Sure.

29:44.670 --> 29:50.076
Oh yeah, no, but look, they're doing something at least.

29:50.276 --> 29:58.345
The things are going to self-destruct all by themselves without intervention anyway.

29:59.226 --> 30:01.609
They, probably, most of them,

30:01.589 --> 30:05.333
are stupefying irrelevance and wellness anyway.

30:05.353 --> 30:13.042
So when they submit the decision has been made, they've got a committee that the only value there is context.

30:13.523 --> 30:14.584
Oh, but even then?

30:14.664 --> 30:17.087
Are they about beer or are they about Cornell?

30:18.588 --> 30:26.297
Are they about beer or something about Ezra's other enterprises or are they about the university?

30:26.598 --> 30:29.004
I think that there is letters in general.

30:29.024 --> 30:36.100
Dear Mr. Smith, thank you for your invitation on your committee.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.947
I regret the press of business that prevents me.

30:39.709 --> 30:44.640
Well, all right, you're going to save that and throw away your Emily Dickinson letters?

30:47.455 --> 30:55.571
Because you don't have the authority, which is to say you don't have the resources not to.

30:55.652 --> 30:58.798
I've also been to the Harvard Deposit Church.

30:58.818 --> 31:02.225
This is going to be a wonderful chapter.

31:02.245 --> 31:06.173
I wish I could explain just the various things that it involves.

31:06.743 --> 31:17.738
Did you want an ice?

31:17.818 --> 31:36.463
Did you want an ice?

31:36.612 --> 31:42.080
Yeah, no, why do it again?

31:43.162 --> 31:47.969
The subs can tell you about that one as well, if you understand.

31:49.291 --> 31:53.136
Tell me, by the way, I've got plenty of time, but I know you don't.

31:53.437 --> 31:57.263
So tell me what about the book I express, okay?

31:57.283 --> 31:58.825
And you must have some literature.

31:58.845 --> 31:59.326
I'll send you some.

31:59.346 --> 32:02.851
I thought I did, but I'll send you a full suite.

32:02.891 --> 32:02.991
Okay.

32:03.713 --> 32:18.958
The Book Arts Press is an institute that supports the study of the history of the book and related subjects.

32:18.978 --> 32:28.033
It is an octopal incorporation chartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

32:28.925 --> 32:33.251
A time that's fonder and pleasurable.

32:33.271 --> 32:35.535
Twenty-five years ago this summer, apparently.

32:36.175 --> 32:40.301
This thing founded up here, like anywhere.

32:40.402 --> 32:43.947
In New York it had no separate existence.

32:43.967 --> 32:52.219
It started out as a course in the Columbia Library School.

32:52.359 --> 32:55.303
And I began acquiring stuff to support my teaching.

32:56.228 --> 33:19.437
And that collection grew a little bit every year so that when I moved the Book Arts Plus equipment and supplies and book collections to Virginia in the summer of 92, I moved, and I'm sure you received for it, just over 21 tons worth of material.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.840
So it grew a lot.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.683
It was not easy to extricate it from Columbia.

33:26.570 --> 33:32.263
I did not wish to have it fall into the hands of the state of Virginia.

33:32.423 --> 33:45.692
So I set up a private corporation, and Columbia was willing to turn over the assets, which is to save the supplies and equipment of the Book Arts Press, through the Book Arts Press, with certain exceptions.

33:47.073 --> 33:54.555
Those they would give up only to the University of Virginia, because they were afraid of liability problems and moving heavy presses.

33:54.615 --> 33:59.209
And so they were given to the University, which then gave them to the Popeye's press.

33:59.965 --> 34:15.783
that if an employee of one of the universities had been damaged during the move of the presses, then the University of Virginia would have been liable not to work on stress.

34:15.903 --> 34:21.670
And given the difference in our resources, that was probably prudent on Columbia's part, although not fine.

34:22.291 --> 34:29.553
because it was a very low risk, and in the event of unnecessary precaution.

34:29.573 --> 34:34.748
But... The La Carte's press is...

34:35.943 --> 34:58.151
I like to call it a collection of cottage industries.

34:58.171 --> 34:58.952
It's a summer school, or a book school.

34:58.972 --> 34:59.492
It's a publishing program.

34:59.512 --> 35:00.473
We do videotapes, we do occasional publications.

35:00.494 --> 35:01.615
It's a lecture year.

35:01.635 --> 35:03.317
We've said thousands of speakers over the years, and in particular, assisted English

35:04.090 --> 35:11.541
and putting together American lecture tours.

35:11.561 --> 35:31.472
Including various tours by Ian Willison, John Dreyfus, James Mosley, Nicholas Pickwell, Christopher Clarkson, Bill Dane.

35:31.492 --> 35:32.173
The Bookhouse Press is in Augusta.

35:32.322 --> 35:42.583
What's unusual about a law?

35:42.604 --> 35:50.500
Is it the principal support for the book that suggests other than that which the University of Virginia gives, which is the matter?

35:53.737 --> 36:12.816
in the form of contributions to the Friends of the Bookhouse Press, and become a friend of the Bookhouse Press, in which there are 600, exactly as of this morning, exactly 600 members.

36:12.836 --> 36:14.898
So I have the opportunity to read the 600 members?

36:14.978 --> 36:15.999
That's right.

36:16.079 --> 36:22.866
Well, it's down to about 630 because I just removed 29 people from the area as the nonpayment, so that's a pretty tight number.

36:23.150 --> 36:36.445
6.29 is the largest you've ever done.

36:36.465 --> 36:45.716
But this time here is always when it's the largest before it gets cut.

36:45.736 --> 36:47.038
Because people have not paid attention to their second use notes.

36:47.058 --> 36:49.020
But the facts of the book are expressed are largely working professionals in the field.

36:49.040 --> 36:49.841
And that's what's unusual.

36:49.861 --> 36:50.862
I don't have, in other words, large donors by now.

36:51.500 --> 37:14.147
It's just people out there, paper and booksellers, paper, librarians, conservatories, binders, book collectors, who support me.

37:14.167 --> 37:17.071
Either to the tune of $30 a year, or of the 600, 200 are close friends at Book Arts Press, $85 a year.

37:17.091 --> 37:18.773
About 30 of them are best friends at Book Arts Press, $250 a year.

37:19.327 --> 37:36.131
And I have several people who give me even louder contributions.

37:36.192 --> 37:46.527
Now, when I was at Columbia, the Book Art Express was the teaching lab for a master's degree in library science with a specialty in rare books.

37:46.547 --> 37:47.829
Which is no longer being taught here, right?

37:47.849 --> 37:48.169
That is correct.

37:48.942 --> 37:56.069
About two-thirds of those students wanted to be verbal librarians and about one-third wanted to be antiquarian booksellers.

37:56.689 --> 38:06.178
And of the people that you know who went through the program, I'll just run a string of names and see which ones you recognize.

38:06.358 --> 38:17.869
Karen Hepps and David Weitzel and David Farris and David Warrington at Harvard, Richard Neville and Sam Streit and Dennis Landis.

38:19.486 --> 38:35.829
at Brown, Bell and Cortis, and Beaver Powell, who may not like you to know, at Yale.

38:36.009 --> 38:40.515
Jeffrey Manser-Weiss at Sydney College, Hartford.

38:41.457 --> 39:09.247
at AAS, Martin Antonetti, now Smith, Virginia Bartow, and Jennifer Lee, and John Graffay, and Miriam Mandelbaum, and Dan Love.

39:09.267 --> 39:10.308
Ross's house name, it'll come in a minute.

39:10.428 --> 39:11.329
At New York Public,

39:12.187 --> 39:31.074
Claudia Funke and Jane Rogers of Columbia, John Goodwell and Gray Immel at Princeton, Dan Craister at Penn, Robert Jones, the new head at Illinois, Alex Schreier at Chicago, Peter Van Lingen at L.C.

39:31.755 --> 39:41.248
And those are just the ones I think are at the top.

39:44.384 --> 39:53.919
Jim Green is a library company, and I can do it by year.

39:53.939 --> 39:56.463
It's a lot of people, but without a list.

39:56.483 --> 40:08.321
Columbia, increasingly, research universities, increasingly, need to have alumni at large at all levels that are either pastors or prestigious.

40:08.341 --> 40:10.965
Columbia doesn't get a beam from its PhDs in Greek.

40:12.616 --> 40:23.703
that it lends prestige to the university to have a celebrated Greek department, and how much prestige they get from the graduates of their business school, that they get plenty of money, so that's okay.

40:24.905 --> 40:27.672
But why do social work?

40:28.647 --> 40:31.770
Why do librarianship?

40:31.790 --> 40:33.691
Why do physical therapy?

40:33.711 --> 40:34.792
There's no money in it.

40:34.812 --> 40:37.215
There's no prestige in it.

40:38.436 --> 40:43.420
They're just doing it as a service to humanity.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.822
That's not good enough.

40:45.842 --> 40:48.985
They don't do librarianship anymore.

40:49.005 --> 40:51.267
They still do social work, but don't hold your breath.

40:51.287 --> 40:54.550
They still do nursing, but don't hold your breath.

40:54.570 --> 40:55.010
They're too expensive.

40:55.030 --> 40:55.951
That kind of education is going to the states.

40:55.971 --> 40:56.832
Because the states will have to support it.

40:57.790 --> 41:13.207
But really, the library skills are disappearing.

41:13.227 --> 41:13.628
Just the fancy ones.

41:13.648 --> 41:13.849
Just what?

41:13.869 --> 41:14.270
Just the fancy ones.

41:14.290 --> 41:15.252
And at its height, there were 75 library skills.

41:15.272 --> 41:15.613
There's still 55.

41:16.538 --> 41:20.528
It's just the ones in the research universities that are under attack.

41:21.350 --> 41:24.118
Are they still relevant in your view?

41:24.659 --> 41:24.880
Yeah, sure.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.123
Are books still relevant?

41:26.283 --> 41:26.604
Sure.

41:26.624 --> 41:28.469
Are they going to be in 50 years?

41:29.351 --> 41:30.354
Not unless they change.

41:30.514 --> 41:31.577
Are they going to change?

41:31.557 --> 41:40.252
Sure, I could do a half a dozen campuses.

41:40.272 --> 41:49.247
University of Michigan, Stanford.

41:49.267 --> 41:53.434
They've opened brand new facilities and they're not even called libraries anymore.

41:53.455 --> 41:54.356
They're called learning resources.

41:54.376 --> 41:54.837
That comes and it goes.

41:54.857 --> 41:56.480
It used to be called under papers, now there are more tissues.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.261
They still deal with bodies.

41:58.135 --> 42:01.928
They used to be called school librarians.

42:02.029 --> 42:04.878
Now they're called media specialists or maybe they're not.

42:04.959 --> 42:07.126
They would be called learning resource specialists.

42:07.568 --> 42:08.230
But that tells you something.

42:12.614 --> 42:33.215
they're not teaching them bibliography, but they're teaching them something about how to find information.

42:33.235 --> 42:34.136
Bibliography is part of that.

42:34.557 --> 42:36.919
The names change.

42:36.939 --> 42:39.702
I don't think we have the luxury of too easily combining change and decay.

42:40.137 --> 42:44.582
Change always looks like decline, decay, decrepity.

42:44.602 --> 42:49.427
It always looks vicious, sinful, and awful.

42:49.447 --> 42:54.432
As you get old, you're sick of change.

42:54.652 --> 43:03.101
A hundred years ago, the library press is full of the difficulties of fiction.

43:03.121 --> 43:07.506
Should public libraries waste their money in buying fiction, it's not good for the people.

43:07.526 --> 43:08.507
The stuff is junk.

43:09.702 --> 43:14.590
Eighty years ago, the big problem in children's literature was Oz books.

43:14.610 --> 43:16.033
They were bad for children.

43:16.233 --> 43:18.457
Many libraries refused to carry Oz books.

43:19.498 --> 43:20.480
They weren't worthwhile.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.842
They taught a kid nothing.

43:22.824 --> 43:27.051
Fifty years ago, comic books.

43:27.071 --> 43:28.774
You know, you brought them on.

43:28.794 --> 43:31.238
Your mother probably didn't want you to have them either.

43:31.606 --> 43:36.973
Now, look what's happened to the graphic novel.

43:36.993 --> 43:39.316
I mean, is this decline or is it just change?

43:39.536 --> 43:46.726
And I think we all need to be as far as we can to figure out what it is that we're saving.

43:46.826 --> 43:55.177
As far as Israel, Israel's letter books are concerned, we're saving the content.

43:55.197 --> 43:56.078
Because we can't.

43:56.277 --> 44:16.489
And it's a miracle if we do that, don't we?

44:16.509 --> 44:20.015
You have a pretty reasonable attitude.

44:20.035 --> 44:20.576
Well, look, of course I do.

44:20.596 --> 44:21.057
What's the alternative?

44:21.077 --> 44:22.639
I want you to use this information with discretion, please, because, you know,

44:25.235 --> 44:46.703
these people are very good friends of mine but look why do you go into librarianship you don't sit there choosing well i could be an explorer or it could be rocket science or it could be a librarian it doesn't work that way you're in a librarianship historically in this country because

44:47.257 --> 44:56.208
If you're interested in a lot of things, you're curious.

44:56.228 --> 44:58.030
That's why librarians are so much fun to be with.

44:58.050 --> 45:02.536
They're genuinely interested in things.

45:02.556 --> 45:03.617
They're not whiners, in my experience.

45:04.498 --> 45:08.623
They do the best they can, which is often very good indeed.

45:09.380 --> 45:23.397
They're knowledgeable, they work hard, they know a lot, but they want a job.

45:23.417 --> 45:29.364
They're not easily confused with Henry Ford or Thomas Alba Edison.

45:30.246 --> 45:32.829
They're not entrepreneurs and they don't want to be.

45:32.849 --> 45:38.796
Many of them are being forced into roles that if they knew they were going to be forced into, then they would never have gone into the profession.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.727
They're forced to raise money.

45:42.747 --> 45:46.552
They're forced to superintend digitization projects.

45:46.572 --> 45:57.324
They're forced to do large amounts of often quite difficult and tedious supervision.

45:57.444 --> 46:04.072
They're forced to take on ever greater responsibility, usually without a commensurate increase in authority.

46:04.092 --> 46:05.013
And a lot of them are wearing pink.

46:05.033 --> 46:05.273
What we need

46:05.725 --> 46:13.135
in a lot of these places is people who are a little bit more entrepreneurial in their attitude.

46:13.155 --> 46:22.947
But if they had that kind of enterprise, that kind of entrepreneurial instinct, they wouldn't have gone into librarianship because entrepreneurs don't take on that kind of work.

46:23.428 --> 46:25.911
Most of librarians in this country are public servants.

46:26.937 --> 46:30.861
A typical librarian works for the state.

46:30.881 --> 46:34.966
Whether it's the University of Michigan, or the city of New York, or something like it.

46:34.986 --> 46:38.610
It's a municipal employee, state employee, federal employee.

46:38.650 --> 46:42.534
The library's the exception, not the rule in this country.

46:42.554 --> 46:45.517
The library's the great exception.

46:45.537 --> 46:51.143
So you've got a lot of very nice and competent people who are suddenly all being asked to be Henry Ford.

46:51.283 --> 46:54.326
Without the resources.

46:54.346 --> 46:55.868
So sure they're involved.

46:55.888 --> 46:56.809
But look, it's an ice bath.

46:58.578 --> 47:12.257
It was easier, I think, for public libraries, when public libraries were universally believed to be a vehicle of municipal pride, which now they're not.

47:12.277 --> 47:14.640
Look at San Francisco.

47:14.660 --> 47:17.765
Despite all that, they built a brand new library.

47:17.945 --> 47:21.790
They're just a great example of municipal pride.

47:21.910 --> 47:25.736
Well, what would they have built if the old one hadn't had to fall down?

47:26.477 --> 47:27.538
Because it's always getting off.

47:29.088 --> 47:33.878
If things are going so well, why did they fire the librarian on open go?

47:33.898 --> 47:36.162
I mean, it's not easy.

47:36.182 --> 47:45.200
But if you look at the great research public library collections, Boston, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Denver, New Orleans, public, terrible public.

47:45.380 --> 47:46.823
Most of them are closed.

47:47.284 --> 47:50.691
Detroit's closed, Denver's closed, Cleveland is living alone.

47:51.025 --> 47:54.909
Boston's not very good, Philadelphia's closed.

47:55.770 --> 48:00.075
It worked 100 years ago, libraries for the College of the People.

48:00.455 --> 48:07.724
The libraries, public libraries, municipal libraries aren't the College of the People anymore.

48:07.804 --> 48:10.026
It went a different way.

48:10.046 --> 48:11.468
And we're still paying for that.

48:11.488 --> 48:15.312
Really, in this generation's thought, didn't realize that everybody would go to college.

48:16.625 --> 48:19.792
So they were providing public continuing education.

48:19.812 --> 48:23.360
It could have gone that way.

48:23.380 --> 48:23.721
It just didn't.

48:23.741 --> 48:25.164
And now we're stuck with it.

48:25.184 --> 48:27.009
We do the best we can.

48:27.029 --> 48:27.630
But it ain't going to be easy.

48:28.707 --> 48:35.374
in places like Detroit is another problem.

48:35.434 --> 48:56.436
Another area, by the way, a chapter I'm doing, Roger suggested this, and it's basically a picking up on Barney Rosenthal's lecture, Malcolm Lecture at Columbia, and trying to locate as many of the surviving emigre booksellers are there, a little over the crowds for instance, to talk to herself.

48:56.416 --> 49:09.601
Well, there are a number of them still around.

49:09.741 --> 49:11.825
Talk to Barney about that.

49:11.845 --> 49:13.328
I interviewed Barney last year.

49:14.354 --> 49:33.526
I've interviewed Otto Bettman for this book.

49:33.546 --> 49:34.067
I can see Otto in Florida.

49:35.819 --> 49:59.834
I'll tell you, the evening that Barney gave that lecture at Columbia was an occasion.

49:59.854 --> 50:01.056
There were 15 of them in the audience, and they were so old.

50:01.076 --> 50:01.917
It was just, it was a moment, to tell you.

50:01.937 --> 50:02.078
Was it?

50:02.098 --> 50:02.759
Can you describe it a little bit?

50:02.779 --> 50:03.700
Maybe you had to get a little bit past Barney.

50:05.317 --> 50:09.904
I thought that he could do it better.

50:10.705 --> 50:15.293
Well, maybe you could describe it as an experiment.

50:15.313 --> 50:18.197
Well, I was... Because you proposed it, I didn't know.

50:18.257 --> 50:18.878
Oh, yeah, sure.

50:19.079 --> 50:22.925
But, detectives, I treasure his response.

50:23.125 --> 50:26.350
Damn you, damn you, damn you.

50:26.370 --> 50:28.894
He decided he wouldn't lecture in public anymore.

50:29.600 --> 50:42.032
and he felt he could not refuse to lecture on this subject for Marianne, who he had known for more than 30 years at that point.

50:42.052 --> 50:47.097
So he wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been that topic, I think.

50:47.197 --> 50:49.840
He's speaking for me next summer.

50:49.860 --> 50:57.227
Well, a while back he gave a talk for me, things about which I've changed my mind in 30 years in the book business.

51:00.160 --> 51:05.548
my mind in 40 years and get business.

51:05.648 --> 51:13.541
So he says they'll do that for me for middle school next summer.

51:13.561 --> 51:28.243
In fact, the lecture itself, the front two rows were made up to a considerable extent of some very old people and their daughters or sons who dropped them.

51:29.438 --> 51:32.701
Roush was still alive, he did not come.

51:32.781 --> 51:36.004
His daughter was there.

51:36.384 --> 51:42.150
He was already pretty shaky.

51:42.890 --> 51:50.437
Saul Malkin himself, of course, had just died.

51:50.457 --> 51:50.938
He had died here before.

51:50.958 --> 51:51.458
Paul Henbacher was there.

51:51.478 --> 51:51.919
Goldschmidt was there.

51:51.939 --> 51:53.901
Marguerite, of course.

51:54.041 --> 51:57.724
I did not really know that generation, of course, because

51:59.003 --> 52:21.688
Back to the Book Arts Press.

52:23.269 --> 52:27.694
The Book Arts Press runs a lecture series,

52:30.256 --> 52:37.169
is unusual because it's really about the underlying bookings, not the only lecture series of any length.

52:37.189 --> 52:37.449
It is.

52:37.469 --> 52:41.176
There have been some exceptions, but not many in the series.

52:41.196 --> 52:47.488
The ones I've published, they are on the underlying bookings.

52:48.194 --> 52:54.700
The Ralkan Lecture this summer is Kathy Lieb on 100 Years of American Book Crisis Probes.

52:54.780 --> 52:56.741
It's their centennial this year.

52:56.822 --> 52:59.204
Is that going to be here?

52:59.404 --> 53:00.225
Is that down there?

53:00.505 --> 53:09.012
The Ralkan Lecture is always, oh yeah, it's been in Charlottesville since 92.

53:09.132 --> 53:17.880
It was Bob Darnton in 92, Justin Schiller in 93, Anthony Roda in 94,

53:19.345 --> 53:25.713
Christopher Dehamel in 95, Ken Rendell in 96, Kathy Deeb in 97, Paul Needham in 98.

53:26.654 --> 53:30.138
Oh, all talking on bookplate subjects.

53:30.158 --> 53:35.545
So it's one of our contributions to the history of the field in the 10th.

53:35.585 --> 53:39.610
There's not much written about the bookplate.

53:39.630 --> 53:40.991
You're surprised how much of it's in Malcolm's interest.

53:41.011 --> 53:43.935
So we're a collection of cottage industries, as I say.

53:46.278 --> 54:08.057
Well, at large, the biggest impact we make is the bookstool because it's big.

54:08.077 --> 54:08.478
It's a little field.

54:08.498 --> 54:09.059
It's big for a little field.

54:09.079 --> 54:09.320
It's little.

54:09.340 --> 54:09.540
We're not.

54:09.560 --> 54:10.241
We're going to be easily confused.

54:10.261 --> 54:10.682
We'll see you online.

54:12.502 --> 54:39.201
But we had 300 people there last summer, and we've had 300 people there every summer since 1983, so that most of the people you're going to be taught to now have some sort of formal relationship with your book school, either as a student, or as a student.

54:42.083 --> 55:05.153
Roger and Barney taught a course together.

55:05.173 --> 55:06.335
Ruth Mortimer and John Lancaster taught a course together.

55:06.355 --> 55:06.975
It's a long list at this point.

55:06.996 --> 55:07.977
Well, you get one and you ask, and it emerges.

55:07.997 --> 55:08.918
John and Ruth is a fairly obvious combination.

55:10.906 --> 55:21.539
married to each other as they were.

55:21.559 --> 55:34.594
I asked Roger to teach a course in acquisitions, and he thought it would be nice if Barney came in for a couple of days, so that's how that happened.

55:34.614 --> 55:35.996
And yeah, there have been some interesting feelings.

55:36.016 --> 55:38.719
I lose money on team-taught courses, so I don't

55:39.475 --> 55:58.247
I'm not going to go out of my way to be imaginative on this, but they occur.

55:58.267 --> 55:59.509
And sometimes it's the only way you can get it close together.

55:59.529 --> 56:00.571
John Goodwell knows European papermaking history.

56:00.591 --> 56:01.613
Timothy Barrett knows Oriental papermaking history.

56:01.633 --> 56:03.275
In the way, he's got a pair of some Japanese and Western papermaking.

56:03.295 --> 56:04.217
I'm just going to turn this on the other side.
