00:02.140 --> 00:04.042
Well, we're talking to Shana Alexander.

00:04.142 --> 00:05.404
It's a delightful book.

00:06.025 --> 00:06.465
Thank you.

00:06.705 --> 00:07.106
I see.

00:07.146 --> 00:12.092
And you say towards the end that you had put off writing this for 11 years.

00:12.292 --> 00:18.459
Tell me a little bit about why you were concerned about writing it.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.242
Well, it isn't exactly that.

00:21.583 --> 00:24.807
Before my father died, I was...

00:25.377 --> 00:31.945
This was the book I always intended to write, urged by Tommy Thompson and anyone else who knew my family and myself.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.969
But Tommy was one of the people I remember.

00:34.989 --> 00:44.941
Maya Angelou was another, and all kinds of savvy people who saw this unusual constellation of father, mother, daughter.

00:47.524 --> 00:55.013
And I just had writer's block on the Patty Hearst book, and my father was too...

00:55.752 --> 01:10.892
Yes, that's right.

01:11.699 --> 01:14.043
And then I lost my collaborator.

01:14.383 --> 01:17.468
We were trying to write a book about Tin Pan Alley.

01:18.650 --> 01:35.277
And I had to go to a great many cities and talk about Patty Hearst, about whom I no longer cared anything, because I was suffused with my father's death, but I had made a kind of a pact.

01:35.425 --> 01:39.109
with my sister and mother that I'd go ahead and do the book tour.

01:40.131 --> 01:48.561
And I asked the various interviewers not to play any of his music.

01:49.362 --> 01:49.642
Really?

01:49.702 --> 01:57.552
This was a mistake, kind of a Faustian bargain that had a terrible rebound.

01:58.190 --> 02:00.133
Because I didn't want to cry.

02:00.173 --> 02:01.095
And I would have cried.

02:01.115 --> 02:02.778
The music, you know, would have made me cry.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.064
And so they didn't play the music, and I didn't cry.

02:06.104 --> 02:07.126
And I finally got home.

02:07.546 --> 02:10.932
Now I was ready to cry, and it had all somehow dried up.

02:11.874 --> 02:13.557
And I didn't know what to do.

02:13.617 --> 02:16.181
I called Irving Berlin, whom I didn't know at all.

02:17.023 --> 02:22.392
But his daughter told me he was in one of his more reclusive than usual situations.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.200
How old was he at this point?

02:25.220 --> 02:26.602
Well, the year was 1979.

02:26.622 --> 02:27.163
Yeah.

02:28.224 --> 02:29.506
So he was over 90.

02:29.586 --> 02:30.407
Amazing.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.289
But Milton had worked for him.

02:32.530 --> 02:35.954
And I didn't really know him.

02:36.034 --> 02:41.061
I knew his daughter, Mary Ellen, somewhat.

02:41.622 --> 02:43.164
We had known each other over the years.

02:44.706 --> 02:44.886
And

02:45.305 --> 02:48.888
So she said, well, you have to write to some old gorgon of a secretary.

02:49.228 --> 02:57.375
And if the secretary thinks your letter is worthy, she will pass it along to Irving, who's up in the Catskills in their house.

02:57.555 --> 02:59.157
The keeper of the gate, so to speak.

02:59.357 --> 03:00.077
Exactly so.

03:00.678 --> 03:01.939
And I did this.

03:02.840 --> 03:08.685
And I remember rushing to the Wayne Scott Post Office, which closed at noon on Saturday in those days, to get it in the mail.

03:09.225 --> 03:13.128
And Monday morning, I was coming in the door with an armful of groceries.

03:13.148 --> 03:15.210
The phone was ringing on the kitchen.

03:15.882 --> 03:45.147
counter hello Shana this is Irving so I dumped the groceries wait a minute and ran upstairs I had been a recording device on my phone because that's how we used to do point counterpoint Kilpatrick and myself one would whoever was going first I don't know if you might be too literary to remember no I enjoyed it that's how I think so many of us were introduced to you as a matter of fact um

03:45.650 --> 03:49.176
So I had the bug on my phone, and I flipped it on.

03:50.959 --> 03:53.904
In other words, that's the way we did the program.

03:54.345 --> 04:04.423
If Jack was going first that week, he would write out his piece, and I would tape it, and then I would write a rebuttal, and vice versa the next week.

04:04.823 --> 04:07.548
But as I recall, you used to face each other in the studio.

04:07.568 --> 04:10.493
No, no, we were, Jack, this was the magic of television.

04:10.962 --> 04:17.049
I was in the studio in Manhattan, and Jack then lived in Woodville, Virginia.

04:17.069 --> 04:18.111
So he drove to Washington.

04:18.892 --> 04:23.197
And we each had our script, and we had them put on teleprompters while we were being made up.

04:23.858 --> 04:26.281
And then we read it to each other.

04:26.301 --> 04:27.302
How do you like that?

04:27.522 --> 04:31.367
I was fooled all those years.

04:31.387 --> 04:32.348
But anyway, I'm sorry.

04:32.368 --> 04:33.249
So Irving called.

04:33.409 --> 04:36.193
So Irving called, and I, of course, taped him.

04:36.253 --> 04:37.274
And he said, you're not taped.

04:37.334 --> 04:40.378
And he talked to me for over an hour in the most adorable time.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.825
and hard-nosed at the same time way.

04:45.165 --> 04:49.010
And he said, your father wrote two great hits, Happy Days Are Here Again, and Ain't She Sweet.

04:49.030 --> 04:49.831
That's all I know.

04:50.212 --> 04:51.393
You're not taping this, are you?

04:51.754 --> 04:54.217
No, sir.

04:54.237 --> 04:55.519
I thought you were just talking to me.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.721
I was scared.

04:58.282 --> 05:01.626
I know, but he said to you, you're not taping this.

05:01.646 --> 05:03.148
How was his mind after all those years?

05:03.168 --> 05:05.491
His mind was absolutely sharp.

05:05.511 --> 05:09.977
And what he said was, he said, I didn't really know your father very well.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.891
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:11.911 --> 05:14.394
He said, but the really interesting one was your mother.

05:14.414 --> 05:22.304
And I said, and he said, your mother knows more about your father than anyone.

05:22.364 --> 05:22.905
Talk to her.

05:23.626 --> 05:25.989
Well, my mother was in deep grief.

05:26.009 --> 05:27.871
He had been dead about 10 weeks.

05:28.812 --> 05:36.842
And I called my mother and I thought to myself, maybe I can, since I don't have Milton for a collaborator, I can write about their life.

05:38.206 --> 05:39.027
with Cecilia.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.610
This was sort of, you know, by talking to her.

05:41.670 --> 05:49.079
This was really a fantasy of my own because she would never talk about herself, as you know from having read the book.

05:49.479 --> 05:55.126
But I thought it would please her that she would like hearing that Irving said she was the interesting one.

05:55.666 --> 05:59.331
If you had had Milton as a collaborator, how different would the book be?

05:59.351 --> 06:01.333
Oh, it would have been a completely different book.

06:01.353 --> 06:06.559
It would have been a book about Shin Pan Alley in the years

06:06.893 --> 06:22.395
between World War I, which is when he had his first hit in 1918, Everything is Peaches Down in Georgia, to wherever we decided to end it, you know, but certainly not beyond World War II.

06:23.957 --> 06:28.103
And there was no such book, and there is no such book.

06:28.784 --> 06:35.213
And Milton was the perfect person because those years were exactly his own peak years, and he

06:35.513 --> 06:37.198
his mind was also very sharp.

06:37.238 --> 06:38.381
He remembered everything.

06:38.942 --> 06:45.119
He was better than one of the... Most of the songbooks, you know, that give you lists of who wrote what.

06:45.199 --> 06:46.442
They're replete with errors.

06:48.969 --> 06:50.012
And...

06:50.228 --> 06:51.750
He knew it all.

06:51.810 --> 06:52.652
He knew all the people.

06:52.732 --> 06:53.894
He knew all the anecdotes.

06:53.954 --> 06:56.317
He knew all the inside stories.

06:56.518 --> 06:57.359
He was a musician.

06:57.439 --> 06:57.840
I'm not.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.544
I'm almost tone deaf like Cecilia.

07:00.664 --> 07:01.345
That's amazing.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.009
And so I couldn't do that book without him.

07:04.109 --> 07:09.638
And the day after I had this conversation with my mother, she had a stroke.

07:09.658 --> 07:11.841
So then I thought, God is really against me.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.684
And I just said, oh, the hell with it.

07:13.704 --> 07:17.670
I put this thing on the back burner and wrote half a dozen more books.

07:17.988 --> 07:20.494
but this was always in my mind.

07:21.456 --> 07:31.660
What was it specifically that Tommy and Maya Angelou... They wanted me to write about my parents and myself because they were unusual.

07:32.382 --> 07:58.153
individuals and and their marriage was a very advanced form of marriage that you didn't see at least in america maybe you saw it in italy i'm not so sure you see it now either it's it really it really appears to be a unique relationship i have to say it was it was by the time i really knew them as three adults who were friends

07:58.488 --> 08:10.566
It was a very fond relationship, although well-peppered with irritability and extremely intimate knowledge of the other person.

08:10.586 --> 08:21.462
Chris, had you written it in collaboration with your father, do you think it would have been less honest, do you say?

08:21.603 --> 08:23.285
Less frank, less candid?

08:23.485 --> 08:24.988
He would be honest.

08:25.148 --> 08:27.972
I think it would be just as honest as it is now.

08:28.289 --> 08:32.054
That was really not the word I wanted to use, but you know what I'm saying.

08:32.074 --> 08:38.241
I guess frank and candid and I guess all these... Because it's really hard to write about yourself, isn't it, sometimes?

08:38.261 --> 08:40.624
It's very hard to write about your parents.

08:40.644 --> 08:40.985
Indeed.

08:42.386 --> 08:45.110
Particularly while they're alive, I would think.

08:45.130 --> 08:57.705
Well, a relationship which is landmined with 20 or 30 or 50 years of history, and you have to transcend...

08:59.153 --> 09:03.399
certain childhood feelings, I suppose, but yet not forget them.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.583
It's not fair to leave them out.

09:06.603 --> 09:23.406
I think what I try to do is come to a gradual understanding of these unusual and extremely reticent people and try to comprehend their relationship to the extent that any child can understand

09:23.723 --> 09:25.966
its parents.

09:25.986 --> 09:28.289
And that's a limited extent.

09:29.351 --> 09:29.992
We know that.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.293
Hausmann was right.

09:31.594 --> 09:35.259
The night my father got me, his mind was not on me.

09:37.081 --> 09:40.887
This is very hard for the... A child is an egotist.

09:42.168 --> 09:44.171
What was the secret to the magic, would you say?

09:44.191 --> 09:47.696
I would say it was several things.

09:48.517 --> 09:52.903
It was terrific mutual respect.

09:53.474 --> 09:59.060
Although they were very different people, each had enormous respect for the other.

09:59.580 --> 10:03.384
They each had a good command of scorn and put down.

10:03.424 --> 10:06.367
They were well matched.

10:08.930 --> 10:13.955
They were witty and very bright.

10:14.876 --> 10:21.363
And they had some kind of a commitment.

10:21.383 --> 10:21.523
Mm-hmm.

10:22.769 --> 10:30.183
My working title for this book was always Poles Apart, a cheap joke, but it described the relationship.

10:30.584 --> 10:37.617
And I only changed the title at the last minute to Happy Days because that was Milton's title and I thought it was more commercial.

10:37.818 --> 10:42.306
And I wasn't sure that my joke wasn't too cheap.

10:42.507 --> 10:43.970
Well, you do keep it for part one.

10:44.150 --> 10:45.773
I kept it inside.

10:47.778 --> 11:11.997
let go of it it's really I mean it does open up you know act one and you did divide it into acts which I thought is I thought was very very nice well thank you well those arrangements sort of come to you as you write the thing over and over and over would you say you were putting off in a way doing it though I mean do you think it really was necessary I mean to to be kind to do it on your own

11:12.702 --> 11:18.228
Would you rather have done it with Milton, or do you think it's correct to have done it this way?

11:18.448 --> 11:19.810
It was a different book.

11:19.930 --> 11:24.094
Of course I would rather have done it with Milton, but that would have been a book about Tin Pan Alley.

11:25.576 --> 11:32.704
That wouldn't have been, I don't think, maybe I didn't answer your earlier question accurately, I think I didn't.

11:34.025 --> 11:40.532
A book about Milton's relationship with his wife, I don't think he would have felt

11:41.052 --> 11:55.607
at ease collaborating with me about it, whereas we would have both felt extremely at ease trying to write down the unwritten history of American popular music.

11:56.568 --> 12:09.000
Where American popular music is uniquely American, and this relationship is distinctive, certainly, would you say this is a distinctively American story that you're telling here?

12:09.571 --> 12:32.845
Well, I would say not only that, but the few people I know that are really in the music business tell me that they learned things that they didn't know before, so that there is actually new information about how different songs were written and how people worked together and what the climate was.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.688
You mean factual type things?

12:34.708 --> 12:35.349
Factual things, yeah.

12:35.569 --> 12:39.375
Just things that hadn't been... There's nothing any good.

12:39.541 --> 12:54.319
Many people have written books about having been songwriters, lyric writers or composers, but the other people that are in the industry have always sneered at the books.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.241
Really?

12:56.522 --> 12:57.743
Yeah.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.606
Nobody has thought they were much good.

12:59.986 --> 13:03.070
I think Michael Feinstein has an excellent book out now.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.251
I don't know if you've read it.

13:04.271 --> 13:05.733
I haven't read it.

13:07.796 --> 13:08.957
That has a lot of good

13:09.427 --> 13:14.756
Information particularly about Ira Gershwin and Harry Warren, who's totally unknown.

13:15.717 --> 13:19.063
I mean, his songs are... It really is.

13:19.143 --> 13:22.849
Tell me what it was like being a child growing up in this environment.

13:22.929 --> 13:25.273
I mean, was it exciting, thrilling?

13:26.555 --> 13:30.742
Were you alert that you were going through something special as a child?

13:30.762 --> 13:34.388
I knew we were different from all other families.

13:35.093 --> 13:43.844
We weren't like the families of any of the other children I knew in my various schools or any families that I read about in books.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.047
And I happened to hate being different.

13:46.167 --> 13:55.458
I couldn't stand not being exactly like Dick and Jane, you know, or Fanny Farmer and whoever her husband was.

13:55.618 --> 13:59.023
I wanted to be what I thought of as normal.

13:59.403 --> 14:03.328
And I thought we were weird, so it was a source of tremendous...

14:04.422 --> 14:05.524
discomfort to me.

14:05.724 --> 14:09.429
You know who said exactly the same thing to me a couple weeks ago was Amy Tan.

14:09.469 --> 14:10.290
Really?

14:10.310 --> 14:10.551
Yeah.

14:10.951 --> 14:15.057
She said she wanted so much to be like every... Of course, she was Chinese American, whatever.

14:16.299 --> 14:20.985
She said, all I wanted was to be... In fact, I even think she said Dick and Shane, you know.

14:21.005 --> 14:27.434
And then, of course, when she realized that she was special and different, she said that is what is uniquely American, isn't it?

14:27.995 --> 14:29.537
Well, that's interesting.

14:29.557 --> 14:29.918
Yeah.

14:29.938 --> 14:31.059
Well, anyway, it's interesting.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.062
My mother, you see, always said

14:33.042 --> 14:35.046
But you're different.

14:36.067 --> 14:40.776
And she was saying, you know, you're better if you only didn't try to imitate Dick and Jane.

14:41.096 --> 14:42.699
You would be the most wonderful creature.

14:43.240 --> 14:54.780
But you destroy, she kept saying, you destroy yourself by trying to have straight hair or whatever I was trying to have, you know, so I would be like the other kids.

14:55.368 --> 15:09.287
But when you look at such a strong parental background, the fact that you achieved so spectacularly on your own, I mean, that kind of runs counter to that kind of a situation, doesn't it?

15:09.548 --> 15:13.874
People talk to me about that, you know, since people who've read this book.

15:13.894 --> 15:17.940
And I never regarded it as achievement.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.865
And I see now that my mother, who also achieved success,

15:22.790 --> 15:24.052
Which is really good to me.

15:24.072 --> 15:25.374
She was exactly the same way.

15:25.394 --> 15:27.117
She didn't talk about her work.

15:27.377 --> 15:28.539
She didn't think much of it.

15:29.821 --> 15:30.582
She belittled it.

15:31.623 --> 15:33.166
And she just wouldn't speak about it.

15:33.406 --> 15:34.348
Why would she belittle it?

15:35.169 --> 15:36.271
Because it was small.

15:36.691 --> 15:41.258
Because there weren't any... It was small in comparison to her husband's work?

15:41.278 --> 15:42.680
No, no.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.844
I didn't ever feel any rivalry.

15:45.204 --> 15:49.050
They were terrifically mutually supportive about one another's work.

15:49.469 --> 15:53.035
Which is so far ahead of its time, isn't it?

15:53.235 --> 15:54.418
Terrifically so.

15:55.800 --> 15:56.802
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

15:57.443 --> 16:00.548
You were talking about your own emergence from this situation.

16:01.049 --> 16:03.353
What I wanted was to be a perfect wife and mother.

16:03.994 --> 16:05.537
I was a terrible wife and mother.

16:08.822 --> 16:13.350
Meanwhile, this other part of myself, which was the professional part,

16:15.085 --> 16:18.128
grew as if it grew in the dark.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.811
I wasn't paying any attention to it and I wasn't ambitious for that.

16:23.272 --> 16:24.574
How do you explain what happened then?

16:25.514 --> 16:26.155
Can you explain it?

16:28.637 --> 16:29.298
Not really.

16:29.538 --> 16:42.910
I think when I stopped, I'm sure I had ability, and when I stopped fighting, stopped trying to be someone else, I guess some of me came out.

16:42.990 --> 16:43.911
I don't know.

16:44.330 --> 16:47.415
I can't explain it.

16:48.136 --> 16:55.108
Many, many women of my generation had the same sort of mother problem that I had.

16:55.128 --> 17:01.579
It was quite commonplace that the daughters of women of achievement had a hard time

17:03.533 --> 17:12.830
Well, it's... And also, I find that some of the reviewers have said, you know, as if I had had Joan Crawford for a mother.

17:13.230 --> 17:15.514
Oh, I mean... I had a wonderful mother.

17:15.555 --> 17:17.458
She just was a lousy mother.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.844
She was very good at everything else.

17:20.864 --> 17:22.768
She was wonderful fun to be with.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.372
She was the best of company.

17:26.134 --> 17:27.516
So...

17:28.103 --> 17:35.652
Looking at the influences then, on the whole, you would consider them very positive then?

17:37.074 --> 17:37.815
Oh, I think so.

17:37.855 --> 17:51.952
I think that whatever standards I have and taste that I have, I learned from them, and they were very sharp, acute judges of behavior and of creative ability.

17:52.392 --> 17:55.596
They had wonderful...

17:55.711 --> 18:04.563
modesty and kind of rectitude, they had wit.

18:06.645 --> 18:09.910
We're looking at the subtitle, My Mother, My Father, My Sister.

18:09.990 --> 18:12.573
Me, through this conversation, we haven't even mentioned your sister yet.

18:13.234 --> 18:13.775
That's true.

18:13.795 --> 18:23.227
But my sister was the most important person in the constellation by the time I wrote this book, because our parents had died.

18:23.267 --> 18:24.469
And...

18:24.685 --> 18:28.570
My sister was the second child, and she was the unfavorite.

18:29.151 --> 18:33.838
And it was made very clear to her that she was not the favorite.

18:33.858 --> 18:50.881
In other words, nobody... You could say that this was a family without hypocrisy, or you could say that it was a family which, you know, which told it like it was, particularly my mother.

18:50.901 --> 18:54.186
So she was in an awful position.

18:55.145 --> 19:06.739
And how to write the story and not dishonor Laurel was a matter of tremendous concern to me.

19:06.819 --> 19:10.864
So you didn't have your mother or your father to collaborate with.

19:12.727 --> 19:14.809
How deeply did you work with your sister?

19:14.869 --> 19:16.511
What I did was this.

19:16.812 --> 19:20.376
I kept her informed as I was working.

19:20.812 --> 19:23.275
as to what I was doing, who I was talking to.

19:23.675 --> 19:25.977
Because I didn't want her to feel left out of.

19:26.538 --> 19:31.243
I wanted her to be fully, you know, briefed.

19:31.263 --> 19:36.849
And when I finally had a manuscript, I sent it to her.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.033
And she was the first person I sent it to.

19:41.073 --> 19:44.497
And she's a very busy woman in her own right.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.819
She's a technical writer, and she...

19:47.457 --> 19:50.560
She is the kind of den mother to a whole bunch of other writers.

19:50.660 --> 19:58.246
Whatever they do is classified, so I don't know, but they do it seven days a week, and she's still at it.

19:58.927 --> 20:06.814
So I had to wait quite a few days before I heard from Laurel, and those were anxious, heart-stopping days.

20:07.294 --> 20:16.502
And finally the phone rang, and she said, Shana, you have written a wonderful book.

20:16.820 --> 20:24.311
She said, of course, there are quite a number of mistakes in it.

20:24.331 --> 20:25.493
I will correct them.

20:25.573 --> 20:26.354
Factual things.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.457
Yes, things that I misremembered.

20:28.838 --> 20:31.502
Or to use a wonderful Irish word, disremembered.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.505
I like that.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.526
But how about impressions?

20:34.566 --> 20:36.870
Did she feel like she had gotten a fair shake?

20:37.190 --> 20:37.571
Oh, yes.

20:37.651 --> 20:39.393
Yes, she didn't feel at all resentful.

20:39.454 --> 20:41.817
That's what I was concerned about.

20:42.558 --> 20:43.840
She felt that I had...

20:44.461 --> 20:45.543
This is her nature.

20:45.603 --> 20:55.478
She felt that I had exaggerated her work, her talents, her husband's abilities, her daughter's abilities.

20:55.698 --> 21:00.325
She felt that I had... She always feels that I overstate.

21:01.908 --> 21:04.111
How about your sense that she was the unfavorite?

21:04.131 --> 21:06.595
Do you think perhaps you overstated that?

21:07.076 --> 21:09.319
No, because she and I have talked about that.

21:10.381 --> 21:11.042
And...

21:11.832 --> 21:19.222
I know how awful it was for Laurel, but the point is that I'd never even talked to her about it until we were over 50.

21:19.242 --> 21:21.285
So I was just going to ask you, if you ever discussed it.

21:21.706 --> 21:23.428
I was the one who couldn't stand to face it.

21:23.669 --> 21:27.374
She faced it at the age of two and always dealt with it.

21:27.394 --> 21:29.577
Usually it's the younger one who's less mature.

21:29.617 --> 21:33.502
Would you say there's a question of maturity here or understanding things?

21:33.783 --> 21:36.947
I would say that in this case, the younger one is the more mature.

21:37.268 --> 21:37.568
Really?

21:37.708 --> 21:38.489
And the more level.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.472
Yes, without question.

21:40.452 --> 21:42.174
That's kind of funny.

21:43.757 --> 21:50.025
Yeah, I really have hesitated to ask you things about the matters that explain themselves perfectly in the book.

21:50.085 --> 21:52.128
So, you know, I have that.

21:54.752 --> 21:56.314
So I don't want to take up too much of your time.

21:56.334 --> 21:57.796
And I really did want to get some quotes.

21:57.836 --> 21:58.417
I enjoyed it.

21:58.457 --> 21:59.438
It's a nice read.

22:00.239 --> 22:02.082
And how many books now have you written?

22:02.262 --> 22:07.029
This must be... Well, about a dozen, I think.

22:07.049 --> 22:08.030
I guess you could count.

22:08.170 --> 22:09.312
I put them all in the...

22:09.646 --> 22:10.887
Okay, yeah, there they are.

22:10.907 --> 22:11.708
I've got them right here.

22:13.190 --> 22:17.194
You say at some point that you feel that this is the book you were born to write?

22:17.374 --> 22:18.856
Somebody at Doubleday said it.

22:18.876 --> 22:19.737
Oh, okay, somebody at Doubleday.

22:19.757 --> 22:20.958
But I think they said it correctly.

22:21.298 --> 22:32.210
I mean, I think that I made out of this book, out of this story, which originally was double the length of what you read.

22:33.912 --> 22:39.518
And I was determined not to have a long book and not to tell everything, but to cover the ground.

22:39.987 --> 22:41.129
fairly.

22:41.430 --> 22:54.994
I think I made a little monument to these two little remarkable people that did a fair job, does a fair job of depicting them and memorializing them.

22:55.696 --> 22:58.781
And it was terribly hard to do because they were my mother and father.

22:59.723 --> 23:04.071
And also because I couldn't, there was only a

23:04.287 --> 23:05.971
a finite amount of material.

23:06.772 --> 23:09.598
I'm not a novelist or a fiction writer.

23:09.618 --> 23:11.603
I couldn't make stuff up and I didn't.

23:12.525 --> 23:20.642
And I feel that I've done something that is worthwhile and that

23:21.145 --> 23:24.569
If they saw it, they would like it.

23:24.689 --> 23:27.852
They might not tell me so, but I think they'd be pleased.

23:27.892 --> 23:34.459
You wrote this largely through the prism of memory, of course, and you really didn't have factual material.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.121
Well, I did a lot of research.

23:36.141 --> 23:44.250
There were still, in particular, my mother's younger brother, a doctor, he has since died, but he had...

23:44.804 --> 23:49.031
And I wouldn't have understood how my grandparents were cousins if I didn't have him.

23:49.592 --> 23:56.864
But I mean, in terms of the things that you experience and that you remember, it really has to be memory, of course.

23:57.665 --> 23:58.346
It isn't memory.

23:58.366 --> 24:01.111
It isn't biography.

24:01.151 --> 24:08.483
But it's a very affectionate and respectful book, and I think that's very important, I think, to point that out in this age of...

24:08.463 --> 24:11.087
So do I. I hope you will point it out.

24:11.308 --> 24:11.628
It is.

24:11.648 --> 24:17.178
I mean, it's nice, and it's very evocative, too, and I think you really captured the spirit of past times.

24:17.658 --> 24:20.283
I'm working out my sentences here, I think.

24:20.323 --> 24:20.924
How old are you?

24:21.104 --> 24:21.805
52.

24:22.106 --> 24:22.426
I see.

24:22.847 --> 24:23.949
Your voice is younger.

24:24.370 --> 24:25.271
Well, thank you.

24:25.692 --> 24:30.340
One likes to know since I've put in my voice.

24:31.101 --> 24:33.645
The art director is the fellow who found the picture.

24:34.146 --> 24:34.707
I just...

24:35.024 --> 24:36.726
I love it, Jack.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.347
I love it, too.

24:37.407 --> 24:39.190
I'm looking at it, and we say... The one on the cover.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.293
Yeah, we talk about an evocative book.

24:41.594 --> 24:43.036
Yeah, Cecilia took the picture.

24:43.076 --> 24:45.699
I'm in a divorce mill called Pyramid Lake.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.784
I'm getting my first divorce, and she came to see me.

24:49.265 --> 24:56.054
And that's a snapshot, and this guy found it, the art director, and blew it up, you know, and knew that it had... But you look so happy.

24:56.275 --> 25:00.541
Yes, I was happy.

25:00.561 --> 25:01.643
I'm in the same place.

25:02.384 --> 25:04.727
It has sort of literary...

25:05.737 --> 25:09.462
overtones or undertones, because A.J.

25:09.502 --> 25:17.534
Liebling, it was a tiny little place called Pyramid Lake, and the phone number I remember was Pyramid Lake 1, and there wasn't any Pyramid Lake 2.

25:18.054 --> 25:18.655
Isn't that funny?

25:19.056 --> 25:27.728
It was just one little kind of really modest dude ranch on an Indian reservation north of Reno.

25:27.708 --> 25:35.835
And Liebling had been there before me, and after me came Arthur Miller, and that's where the misfits happened.

25:35.875 --> 25:41.560
I mean, that's where he saw the horse wranglers, you know, the people who rounded up the wild horses.

25:42.721 --> 25:49.347
Now, you mentioned all the other books that you've done, but I also sense that you could only have written this book at this point in your life.

25:49.407 --> 25:50.088
Yes, you're right.

25:51.589 --> 25:52.290
I couldn't have done it.

25:52.490 --> 25:55.993
I didn't have enough detachment or...

25:56.463 --> 25:58.185
grasp or nerve?

25:58.947 --> 26:01.370
Yeah, I mean, there are certain things that are right at certain times.

26:01.791 --> 26:05.075
I just wrote, my first book has just been published, I'm pleased to say.

26:05.116 --> 26:06.818
What did you write about?

26:07.018 --> 26:16.552
I wrote about bibliomania, book madness, and the title of the book is A Gentle Madness, and it's about to go into its fourth printing, I'm thrilled to say.

26:16.592 --> 26:22.240
It's my first book at the age of... Does it mean people, how do you use the term?

26:22.320 --> 26:23.382
I know the term, but...

26:23.750 --> 26:27.922
Someone has a book about someone who's been stealing books.

26:27.942 --> 26:28.844
Is that your book?

26:28.864 --> 26:29.486
That's my book.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.649
Okay.

26:30.709 --> 26:32.194
Well, that's just one of the chapters.

26:32.414 --> 26:32.655
Yes, right.

26:33.517 --> 26:34.600
And it's doing pretty good.

26:34.701 --> 26:38.772
They told me yesterday that the third printing is gone.

26:38.752 --> 26:57.366
and the back order is like 2,600 books, and it's a big expensive book, you know, nobody expected to buy it, and one of these great exciting things, but I've maintained, I could not have written it, you know, 15 years ago, I had to be this age to... What were you doing 15 years ago?

26:57.387 --> 27:01.975
I was a book editor in Worcester, I was writing a literary column, and

27:02.528 --> 27:05.052
And it came time to leave.

27:05.072 --> 27:14.625
I've got two young daughters, and, you know, after 15 years at the same place, it's time to... Yes, I had a friend who correctly advised me every seven years.

27:15.146 --> 27:18.451
I wish I had taken that advice more literally.

27:19.392 --> 27:20.654
Bill Atwood, did you ever know Bill?

27:20.714 --> 27:21.776
No, I didn't, actually.

27:22.156 --> 27:26.983
But I remember you quoted... Tommy Thompson gave me a quote, and then you quoted it as well.

27:27.655 --> 27:30.940
My book, by the way, is thrilling, my publisher.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.885
The first printing was 6,700 and we're about to up to 50,000.

27:35.005 --> 27:37.088
Yeah, it really is.

27:37.149 --> 27:38.831
And so they want to know what the next book is.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.395
And I remember you telling me, you quoted Tommy Thompson.

27:41.455 --> 27:48.224
It's like picking somebody that you're going to sleep with for the next three or four or five years, whether or not you really want to do this book.

27:48.264 --> 27:50.828
Well, yes, the person lives in your head.

27:50.808 --> 28:11.415
And particularly if you don't have two young daughters or, you know, in other words, if you live with two young dogs, as I do, or a middle-aged dog and her young son, and you don't have much family around, even more so, there's no relief from the characters you're writing about.

28:11.455 --> 28:19.245
And that's why I never wrote, I used to tell everybody, why has no one done a biography of Roy Cohn?

28:19.748 --> 28:25.574
because finally Nick von Hoffman did one, somebody else did one, but for a long time there wasn't any.

28:26.014 --> 28:28.056
And people would say back, why don't you do it?

28:28.076 --> 28:29.978
You're the perfect person.

28:29.998 --> 28:30.679
Roy Cohn?

28:32.040 --> 28:32.140
Yeah.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.622
Well, David McCullough quit doing Picasso.

28:34.642 --> 28:37.125
He says, the more I looked into him, the more I hated him.

28:37.465 --> 28:38.646
He says, I quit.

28:38.706 --> 28:42.310
I didn't know that, but you do have to be self-preservative.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.112
Yeah, and he said, that was it.

28:44.172 --> 28:49.637
He said, why should I spend my... Then he switched over to Truman, you know, somebody he really liked and admired.

28:49.617 --> 28:52.220
Now the Counter-Reformation is setting in.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.562
I know.

28:53.842 --> 28:55.665
But I like McCulloch's Truman.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.606
Well, I do.

28:56.626 --> 28:57.808
He's such a wonderful writer.

28:58.288 --> 28:58.829
I do, too.

28:58.849 --> 29:01.873
Well, you write to be read, I think.

29:01.913 --> 29:06.459
That's one of the things I really enjoy about your books.

29:06.479 --> 29:14.068
And you also mentioned your friendship with Gene Harris, how there was a subject for a book who became a friend and a confidant.

29:14.910 --> 29:17.633
And more than that, really...

29:18.018 --> 29:23.406
Nick, because if I could write a play, I would love to write a play.

29:24.648 --> 29:36.065
In fact, once in a while I work at it a little bit, but a very strange thing happened over the 12 years that she was in prison.

29:36.085 --> 29:41.352
We got to know each other, and I actually didn't start.

29:41.373 --> 29:47.822
I had started work on the book the day that I heard that she was arrested, but

29:48.275 --> 30:05.195
Her lawyers tried to keep us apart during the trial, and it was only after they succeeded in getting her convicted that I had free access to her and she to me, because in a woman's prison, most of them have young children, and so they have to have extremely liberal visiting hours.

30:06.036 --> 30:10.982
And so I could spend as much time with Jean as I wanted if I, you know, up in the slammer.

30:11.702 --> 30:17.269
And she never read the book, and I can tell that she still hasn't read it.

30:17.367 --> 30:27.980
And after it came out, then she wrote a book and finally three books, one of which was a book of letters to me, but it's really a description of prison life.

30:30.663 --> 30:42.237
But a shift in the balance of power took place over those years, and whereas in the beginning, in my image, she was like a drowning person holding on to me.

30:42.357 --> 30:46.142
I believed her, and very few people did.

30:46.578 --> 30:58.113
And by the end of it, of the 12 years, I felt that she was holding me up by her staunch friendship.

30:58.174 --> 31:00.477
And she's very funny and marvelous to talk to.

31:00.497 --> 31:01.939
That would make a wonderful play, by the way.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.140
It would make a great play.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.522
I can just see it staged.

31:04.662 --> 31:08.307
It would be so easy to stage because it could be very spare.

31:08.327 --> 31:10.951
And I would like to do it in the phone conversation.

31:10.971 --> 31:11.712
Two characters.

31:11.732 --> 31:12.693
That's all you need.

31:12.793 --> 31:15.657
And it'll keep two old actresses really happy.

31:15.637 --> 31:17.179
It would be wonderful.

31:18.801 --> 31:20.243
Let's see, one other question.

31:20.263 --> 31:22.185
What else did I want to ask you about, Jean Harris?

31:22.205 --> 31:38.105
Well, when you think about that woman did 12 years, and you think of somebody like Simpson, when you look at the comparison of the crimes now, and that she actually, with her heart condition, and the fact that she's no threat to anybody, I think of this now, that she did 12 years.

31:38.145 --> 31:44.293
Yes, and that she would, if she hadn't had the heart condition, and if the governor hadn't got...

31:44.999 --> 31:47.372
frightened that she might not survive the surgery.

31:47.392 --> 31:48.196
She'd still be there.

31:48.216 --> 31:49.041
She'd still be there.

31:49.483 --> 31:50.147
I'm sure of it.

31:50.187 --> 31:50.790
Amazing.

31:51.665 --> 31:52.867
Well, listen, I'm going to let you go.

31:52.887 --> 31:54.048
I had a wonderful chat.

31:54.389 --> 31:55.611
I've enjoyed it very much.

31:55.731 --> 31:57.333
And this will make a great piece.

31:57.353 --> 32:05.665
And I have a couple of papers that take me, by the way, Tallahassee, for instance, and Asbury Park in New Jersey.

32:06.226 --> 32:08.289
I've done pretty well going after these papers.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.933
And you made your own syndicate.

32:10.973 --> 32:13.697
It's called Literary Features Syndicate, believe it or not.

32:14.478 --> 32:20.727
And what I do is offer these wonderful interviews and profiles of authors of what I consider important books.

32:20.707 --> 32:25.315
I do one a week, and I... Could you send me more than just myself?

32:25.415 --> 32:25.635
Sure.

32:25.655 --> 32:26.677
I'd love to read some of them.

32:26.697 --> 32:30.223
Oh, I do... Because I'm looking for some other sort of things to do.

32:30.444 --> 32:32.367
Well, sure, I'd be happy to.

32:32.507 --> 32:33.028
It'd be my pleasure.

32:33.048 --> 32:33.549
I'd love to read them.

32:33.569 --> 32:36.193
I mean, I'd like to read Umberto Eco or anybody else.

32:36.213 --> 32:41.342
Umberto Eco, Doris Lessing, Amy Tan, Anne Beattie.

32:41.382 --> 32:42.985
I do a different one each week.

32:43.505 --> 32:46.811
Did you do, was Doris Lessing here or did you go?

32:46.832 --> 32:48.675
I went to New York to do her last year.

32:48.695 --> 32:50.058
Oh, but I mean she was in New York.

32:50.078 --> 32:50.839
This was last year.

32:50.899 --> 32:51.461
Yeah.

32:51.481 --> 32:52.282
Yeah, when she came.

32:52.563 --> 32:54.246
I'll travel to do these interviews.

32:54.306 --> 32:59.877
Normally I like to do a face-to-face interview, but I did tell Marley.

32:59.857 --> 33:03.906
I am impressed by your book.

33:04.307 --> 33:09.217
That means a great deal to me.

33:09.759 --> 33:10.480
You know how it is.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.068
It's so hard to do these telephone things, and I would much rather do them.

33:14.555 --> 33:20.621
in person, but I have met you before, so we are both journalists, so we know what we're doing.

33:20.641 --> 33:21.983
What's the feeling about the other person?

33:22.023 --> 33:27.469
You're very easy to talk to, and I know that I'll like whatever you do.

33:27.789 --> 33:31.373
People say to me, how come you like everyone that you write about?

33:31.433 --> 33:34.616
I say, because I choose the people I want to write about.

33:35.057 --> 33:35.958
Very selective.

33:37.139 --> 33:39.021
That's the hard kind of writing.

33:39.041 --> 33:40.182
It is, isn't it?

33:40.202 --> 33:42.705
And to sustain it week after week.

33:42.685 --> 33:56.240
Because my mother was a critic, and she too felt it was absolutely, she felt, you know, honor bound if she'd like something to celebrate it in appropriate terms.

33:56.780 --> 34:04.149
And we were having a little mini film festival at the Museum of Modern Art in December, if you're ever in New York.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.510
I'm in often, actually.

34:05.850 --> 34:07.292
Well, it's December 7th.

34:07.542 --> 34:08.423
Pearl Harbor Day.

34:08.463 --> 34:08.964
Pearl Harbor Day.

34:08.984 --> 34:14.610
And the museum helped me sort out her reviews, her papers, and I gave them all.

34:14.710 --> 34:16.032
Isn't that great?

34:16.052 --> 34:16.292
Yeah.

34:16.853 --> 34:22.639
And so they're going to show a movie called The King of Jazz, which movie buffs.

34:24.561 --> 34:26.263
It was a very early talking movie.

34:26.283 --> 34:27.885
There's quite a bit about it in my book.

34:27.905 --> 34:35.754
You can have the first dolly shots, the first cartoon, the first color, the first everything.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.296
And Milton wrote most of the songs.

34:37.597 --> 34:44.224
So they're going to show that in the morning and in the evening or in the afternoon.

34:44.605 --> 35:03.926
In the evening, they're going to show The Treasure of Sierra Madre because among Cecilia's papers is a letter from John Huston that says that her review of that movie, which I quote a little bit of in my book, was the best movie review he'd ever read.

35:03.966 --> 35:04.887
Isn't that something?

35:05.710 --> 35:11.177
There must have been something growing up with so much creative energy, though, in the household.

35:11.798 --> 35:15.802
I didn't know anything else.

35:18.366 --> 35:29.920
It didn't strike you as being extraordinary at the time, that there was so much, that people were thinking and feeling differently in your household than they were every place else?

35:29.940 --> 35:34.806
No, to be honest, it struck me as acutely embarrassing.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.974
That's a good line.

35:41.034 --> 35:41.775
I can use that.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.983
I'm not proud of it, but that's the truth.

35:47.264 --> 35:48.986
Well, embarrassing in what sense?

35:49.547 --> 35:50.969
We're back to Dick and Jane.

35:52.471 --> 35:54.755
But when other people were there, they would embarrass you?

35:55.095 --> 35:56.017
You would feel embarrassed?

35:56.137 --> 35:58.460
God, when they came, occasionally they came to school.

35:59.382 --> 36:00.203
Almost never.

36:00.554 --> 36:03.420
But on those rare occasions that they did.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.182
Oh, yes.

36:04.282 --> 36:06.968
I mean, my mother was a very fashionable woman.

36:06.988 --> 36:10.395
She didn't look like any of the other mothers or any of the teachers in the school.

36:11.197 --> 36:18.713
And she smoked and I don't know.

36:18.733 --> 36:20.537
I just couldn't stand it.

36:22.070 --> 36:23.111
Well, I'm going to let you go.

36:23.131 --> 36:25.773
I do miss those point-counterpoint exchanges.

36:26.154 --> 36:29.196
That was very... That was only fun for a while.

36:29.997 --> 36:31.038
You know, after a while.

36:31.218 --> 36:34.141
After a while, it's like engraving the Lord's Prayer.

36:34.161 --> 36:35.522
I think, yeah.

36:35.542 --> 36:36.403
You can do it.

36:36.423 --> 36:37.844
It had its run, I guess.

36:37.944 --> 36:41.788
And it had its run, and it had very unpleasant aspects.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.731
And so I'm extremely glad to be out of it.

36:44.751 --> 36:45.071
Unpleasant?

36:45.091 --> 36:46.672
You mean personally?

36:47.453 --> 36:49.035
Personally, fiscally.

36:49.535 --> 36:50.055
Really?

36:50.075 --> 36:50.676
And...

36:51.584 --> 36:52.685
I felt exploited.

36:52.705 --> 36:55.048
In what respect?

36:55.068 --> 36:56.610
That you were the token woman on TV?

36:56.630 --> 36:58.793
I could never get more than $600 a week.

36:59.794 --> 37:00.275
Jesus.

37:01.296 --> 37:01.736
You're kidding me.

37:01.757 --> 37:03.379
And when I finally said, I can't do this.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.461
$600 is all you got for that?

37:05.481 --> 37:05.741
Yes.

37:06.482 --> 37:07.964
And so did Jack.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.687
But Jack was writing three columns a week.

37:10.748 --> 37:13.311
Well, he had a regular gig going, though.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.352
Yes, that's what I mean.

37:14.372 --> 37:16.374
In other words, he was up on things.

37:16.395 --> 37:16.815
Yeah.

37:16.981 --> 37:23.150
If we were going to, if we decided to do the defense budget or, you know, agricultural subsidies, whatever we were going to do.

37:23.851 --> 37:28.317
He was part of the Washington Press Corps, and he was writing three a week.

37:28.517 --> 37:36.829
For me, it was a way of staying legitimate as a journalist, because by that time I was drowning in my Patty Hearst.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.142
Yeah.

37:39.162 --> 37:45.652
It did give you a visibility, though, that was, I think millions of people know who you are who might not otherwise.

37:45.852 --> 37:46.574
Millions of people.

37:46.874 --> 37:48.276
Yeah, I just said that, millions.

37:48.296 --> 37:48.797
Many, many millions.

37:48.817 --> 37:48.917
Yeah.

37:48.937 --> 37:50.299
But they have me.

37:50.319 --> 37:52.282
But to them, I'm the ignorant slut.

37:53.224 --> 37:53.965
Come on now.

37:54.205 --> 37:54.946
Maybe they're right.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.951
Don't say that.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.574
I was very ignorant for a long time.

38:00.134 --> 38:00.555
Oh, no.

38:01.193 --> 38:05.531
Well, I dispute that, and I'm going to let you go.

38:05.731 --> 38:06.836
You're a nice fan.

38:06.896 --> 38:08.001
It was fun to talk to you.

38:08.021 --> 38:08.563
I enjoyed it.

38:08.623 --> 38:09.406
Let me see some of them.

38:09.426 --> 38:10.149
I'll be pleased to.

38:10.169 --> 38:10.732
Thank you.

38:10.852 --> 38:11.575
Bye-bye.
