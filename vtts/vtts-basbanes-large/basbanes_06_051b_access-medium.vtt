WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:06.382
Can I go back to one thing?

00:08.865 --> 00:09.847
This is fascinating.

00:11.249 --> 00:24.526
You say that you really developed your expertise as a result of this collector who was an anonymous collector who bought this collection on block.

00:24.546 --> 00:30.814
You met this collector for the first time after he or she or whoever had bought this collection.

00:31.182 --> 00:31.823
The collection.

00:32.083 --> 00:35.689
The collector clearly was very impressed.

00:35.709 --> 00:36.710
The collection was beautiful.

00:36.730 --> 00:37.852
The collection was beautiful.

00:38.553 --> 00:42.438
And I would assume approach to it that I want more.

00:43.239 --> 00:43.420
Yes.

00:43.981 --> 00:45.743
And so thus began.

00:46.023 --> 00:47.285
Yeah.

00:47.546 --> 01:00.244
Except, I mean, that meant that a lot of these bindings started to come through my hands that I got to handle into catalogs that I wouldn't have otherwise.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.472
I mean, in vast numbers, you know, hundreds and hundreds of books.

01:03.492 --> 01:03.772
Oh, sorry.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.635
In other words, the word, get out there.

01:05.915 --> 01:07.438
I was out looking all the time.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.721
I think you were out looking.

01:09.741 --> 01:12.806
And I represented the collector's office.

01:12.826 --> 01:14.148
You went to all these offices.

01:16.471 --> 01:17.974
I went to all these offices.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.716
But the background was already there.

01:19.756 --> 01:22.060
I mean, you know, the School of Paris background was already there.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.046
I mean, I could look at a Durant.

01:26.296 --> 01:35.689
from his Froese period and know that the book was going to be worth more money than a draft that was done in the later part of his life, because his paintings are worth more money.

01:36.150 --> 01:47.205
I mean, I'm very tied into the art world, and I almost come to this with the art dealer's mentality rather than the book dealer's mentality.

01:47.606 --> 01:54.836
That's why I've asked a few questions in a very gentle way about, again, is it a book or is it an artwork?

01:54.856 --> 01:56.218
Is the book one for Sylvester?

01:56.722 --> 02:06.988
When you get to a print dealer and he's cut up like this is jazz, this book here, this book is sold as individual play all over the place.

02:07.008 --> 02:10.056
And that's why there's very few of the whole book left.

02:11.268 --> 02:12.930
The same thing that blew off.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.571
The same thing with Picasso.

02:14.852 --> 02:17.334
Well, Brazilla did a reprint.

02:17.374 --> 02:21.318
And that thing was a big... That's up to $250,000.

02:21.459 --> 02:26.444
This was an incredible one.

02:26.824 --> 02:30.988
The first time I sold that book, I sold it for 47... You sold the Matisse?

02:31.008 --> 02:31.129
Yeah.

02:31.169 --> 02:35.653
The first time I sold the Matisse Jazz was in 85, and I sold it for $47,000.

02:36.554 --> 02:36.754
Wow.

02:37.155 --> 02:37.756
The next time?

02:38.857 --> 02:39.237
$52,000.

02:39.337 --> 02:40.178
You did this in New York.

02:40.529 --> 02:42.452
Do you have these kind of customers up here in Boston?

02:42.692 --> 02:45.356
No, they're not in Boston, no.

02:45.376 --> 02:49.122
I sell from Boston, but I don't sell it to people from Boston.

02:49.142 --> 02:51.085
Your clientele generally would be?

02:52.267 --> 03:05.847
I have a handful of clients that are international, in Europe as well as in the United States.

03:05.868 --> 03:08.832
The most satisfying thing about the last book there was that for eight years, Priscilla's been working,

03:09.807 --> 03:25.703
I know the feeling in a very different kind of a way.

03:25.763 --> 03:33.931
I succeeded at the Worcester Telegraph's book editor, the guy who was the founder and first president of the National Book Critics Circle.

03:34.332 --> 03:37.755
And they give the award every year, the Ivan Sandroff Award.

03:38.292 --> 03:46.883
And I will never forget, after five or six years, we had a party for it.

03:46.903 --> 03:47.864
Thank you for the material.

03:48.666 --> 03:51.209
This time, two inscribed copies.

03:52.070 --> 03:54.073
And I'm working my way backwards.

03:54.093 --> 03:59.059
You mentioned Houdini, so I just want to show you the link between Doyle and Houdini.

04:02.864 --> 04:03.625
Here's a great book.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.860
This is all about Doyle's spiritualist phase, which I mentioned to him.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.222
I saw the little letters.

04:10.242 --> 04:11.544
See, everything hangs together.

04:11.624 --> 04:12.826
You saw the little photographs.

04:14.368 --> 04:19.276
He and Houdini were very close, until... Houdini was a pretty good collector, too, actually.

04:19.296 --> 04:22.160
He was a collector, but then there was a break.

04:22.180 --> 04:29.511
Doyle stayed with the mediums, and he felt that spiritualism was a bona fide religion, if you will.

04:30.065 --> 04:32.228
Houdini said, that is baloney.

04:32.729 --> 04:35.994
I can debunk every medium you will ever bring to me.

04:36.595 --> 04:38.257
But this was during their friendly period.

04:41.181 --> 04:41.842
To my friend.

04:42.123 --> 04:44.206
Houdini from A. Conan Doyle.

04:44.226 --> 04:45.047
Arthur Conan Doyle.

04:46.649 --> 04:47.310
Given to me.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.572
Houdini's book plate.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.093
Oh, wow.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.956
This from the same collection?

04:52.478 --> 04:53.099
Yes, this is.

04:53.580 --> 04:58.587
Given to me by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on his visit to my home, 278.

04:58.820 --> 05:24.523
on the 13th street new york houdini lady doyle visited mrs houdini the same day and they wrote this thing they knew they look at the condition of the book right yeah but were these books issued with jackets by the way everything is this is with jacket that's one thing if anyone ever tells you that these things weren't issued with jacket there are almost no things that were issued without a jacket

05:24.841 --> 05:32.890
I would say particularly beginning around the 1880s, and there were even earlier jackets, but beginning with the 1880s, and I'll show you some things that are very rare worth, John.

05:32.910 --> 05:34.111
What's the year in this book?

05:34.151 --> 05:36.194
The Wanderings of a Spiritual Cell?

05:36.554 --> 05:38.857
I don't want to give you the exact name.

05:38.897 --> 05:39.818
Just so we know.

05:39.838 --> 05:40.919
Gold story in 1921.

05:40.939 --> 05:41.239
1921.

05:41.940 --> 05:44.863
Now, the book alone, without a jacket.

05:44.924 --> 05:48.908
I'm just going to tell you that my machine wasn't running when we read that letter.

05:49.445 --> 05:57.957
We don't have to read the whole letter again, but you did tell me some quotes about, because I'll get it again at some point, but the quotes about how you got this collection from another collector.

05:58.337 --> 06:04.867
In the case of a collector, I'm just replaying it in my mind, wanting the collection to go to another collector.

06:05.247 --> 06:06.449
That's very important to me.

06:07.771 --> 06:18.726
But always with price entering into it, so that in my world and the way I deal with things, I specifically asked this person, and the person took my advice,

06:19.094 --> 06:25.223
to go to other major sources against whom I was willing to compete and be held up.

06:25.243 --> 06:26.645
Did he ever tell you what they quoted?

06:26.685 --> 06:27.927
No, never did.

06:28.868 --> 06:30.771
But he was satisfied that you were in the ballpark.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.272
Exactly.

06:31.873 --> 06:34.777
And I'm sure in your heart of hearts, you know that you probably got it.

06:35.578 --> 06:36.940
Maybe, well, you don't know.

06:37.181 --> 06:42.468
I paid through the nose for me on this collection.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.253
But he would have done anything to have it.

06:45.393 --> 06:46.054
Of course.

06:46.094 --> 06:48.257
The night before I went to pick this up,

06:48.541 --> 06:52.726
I was lying next to Priscilla, and I couldn't sleep the whole night.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.710
He was so excited about having these books.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.312
That's the way I get it.

06:57.673 --> 07:01.217
How extensive was the collection that you got from this collection?

07:01.237 --> 07:02.399
He had a great collection.

07:02.419 --> 07:05.443
He had a great collection, but you just made it greater.

07:05.923 --> 07:09.027
Here's a good example of something from my collection that I had before.

07:09.448 --> 07:11.190
This is an incredible rarity.

07:11.828 --> 07:18.517
This is the first American edition of the Valley of Fear, but it's also the first edition, because this was first printed in the United States.

07:18.537 --> 07:19.338
The Valley of Fear.

07:19.358 --> 07:20.239
So this is the first edition.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.381
One of the chef's doors.

07:21.401 --> 07:22.362
This is Molly McGraw.

07:22.462 --> 07:23.544
And a very nice copy.

07:24.285 --> 07:25.326
But the jacket is beautiful.

07:25.346 --> 07:26.408
The jacket is so good.

07:26.428 --> 07:29.432
It's a great, superb jacket and an inscription by Doyle.

07:30.153 --> 07:30.934
So this...

07:31.252 --> 07:33.775
I mean, these are things that people would go for.

07:33.796 --> 07:38.342
If you were to find a jacket for that Houdini book, would you put it on there?

07:38.502 --> 07:41.286
Well, you could, but you know, it wouldn't add that much to the book.

07:41.606 --> 07:46.353
The book itself, that Houdini book... Well, the association... You're wrong, you're wrong.

07:46.653 --> 07:55.926
That Houdini book is wonderful, you know, a great book, but the book itself, without the Houdini signature, is worth $100, $125 maybe.

07:56.627 --> 08:00.212
With a jacket, it's probably worth $500.

08:00.530 --> 08:03.194
with the Houdini signatures, what, $15,000, $20,000.

08:04.676 --> 08:08.162
You see, that, you know, there's a whole magnitude of difference.

08:08.182 --> 08:10.345
It's just, it's just, you can't remember.

08:10.485 --> 08:17.836
Where, where was that thing that we just mailed to the, just so I can cue my, we don't have to go through the whole letter again, but my machine was off for about two minutes there.

08:18.337 --> 08:19.940
I was getting too excited.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.422
It's Royal Lynx Hotel.

08:22.383 --> 08:23.225
Chroma.

08:23.245 --> 08:24.146
Chroma.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.790
CMO EMER, National Telephone Number 2-0.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.782
to Green, G-R-E-E-N-H-R-U-G-H, Smith.

08:30.082 --> 08:31.244
We don't have to read the whole thing.

08:31.384 --> 08:32.726
The editor of the Strand Magazine.

08:32.766 --> 08:34.348
But, but, but, go ahead.

08:34.428 --> 08:41.477
My dear Strand, I have the idea, my dear Smith, I have the idea of a real creeper for the Strand.

08:42.158 --> 08:45.142
It would run, I think, to not less than 40,000 words.

08:45.623 --> 08:53.374
It is just the sort of thing which would suit you, full of surprises and breaking naturally into good lengths for serial purposes.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.558
It would be called the Hound of the Basketball's.

08:57.027 --> 08:58.669
That's all I need, really.

08:59.110 --> 09:02.053
Although I love the details about how much you want to get paid.

09:02.914 --> 09:04.757
Now, I have weird things in the collection.

09:04.937 --> 09:06.759
Wouldn't it be nice to have the guy's response?

09:06.779 --> 09:06.999
Yeah.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.081
This is incredible.

09:09.362 --> 09:13.187
This is A Visit to Heaven by Mary Conan Doyle.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.551
This is Doyle's daughter, written when she was eight years old.

09:17.332 --> 09:18.073
Eight years old.

09:18.574 --> 09:19.575
Again, being false-making.

09:19.724 --> 09:20.825
and my box maker.

09:22.027 --> 09:22.507
Here it is.

09:23.408 --> 09:24.910
With the author's love, Mary.

09:24.950 --> 09:25.951
This is Doyle's.

09:26.071 --> 09:32.158
This came out in probably like five copies, and this is an inscribed copy of the five copies, right?

09:33.319 --> 09:44.032
So it's not Sherlock Holmes, and it's not by Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's so rare that it takes on a life of its own almost.

09:46.094 --> 09:46.354
Okay.

09:46.534 --> 09:47.475
This is interesting.

09:48.076 --> 09:48.837
I think we all

09:49.120 --> 09:51.303
This is the first meeting of the Baker Street Irregulars.

09:51.323 --> 09:54.126
Remember we talked in New York about the Baker Street Irregulars?

09:54.607 --> 09:55.949
Rich Paul Clarkson was a member.

09:56.049 --> 09:56.289
Right.

09:56.570 --> 09:57.911
And this is the first meeting.

09:57.931 --> 10:02.497
The menu for the first meeting in 1934.

10:02.597 --> 10:05.661
It doesn't say the restaurant, but it was Tony's Restaurant.

10:06.082 --> 10:09.526
Where I used to go, long before I knew that, that was the meeting place.

10:09.546 --> 10:10.287
Now it's a shrine.

10:10.448 --> 10:13.592
Now it's gone now.

10:13.612 --> 10:14.553
And who's signed?

10:15.074 --> 10:15.474
Everybody.

10:15.614 --> 10:16.555
Christopher Morley.

10:16.696 --> 10:17.777
Christopher Morley.

10:18.955 --> 10:24.244
Oh, look at that.

10:24.645 --> 10:25.867
These are all these guys.

10:25.927 --> 10:26.848
There's William Gillette.

10:29.433 --> 10:30.374
Let's see.

10:30.395 --> 10:32.458
Frederick Dorsteel, one of the great illustrators.

10:32.979 --> 10:37.487
Lawrence P. Dodge, who in later years, I learned, lived in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.109
Who is this one?

10:39.129 --> 10:40.171
Price.

10:40.452 --> 10:41.173
Alan Price.

10:41.473 --> 10:42.415
Earl Walbridge.

10:42.665 --> 10:45.931
who was a customer of mine when I was at the New York Public Library.

10:46.311 --> 10:48.756
I used to get books for him, run books from the stank.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.138
Peace Soup, Cadigan West.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.621
I'm looking at those menus.

10:51.641 --> 10:52.001
Right.

10:52.262 --> 10:54.446
These all have to do with Sherlock Holmes, right?

10:54.466 --> 10:57.671
The Noble Bachelor, Chateau Reichenbach.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.454
You know, Plover's eggs.

10:59.474 --> 11:00.997
Can you imagine they had Plover's eggs?

11:01.017 --> 11:01.558
That's great.

11:03.722 --> 11:06.647
So, again, not everything is measured in money.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.872
You know, this is not worth so much money.

11:10.112 --> 11:11.734
It's the rarity.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.655
What are you talking about?

11:12.675 --> 11:13.916
But it's the rarity, yeah, the rarity.

11:13.996 --> 11:16.960
And look at the beautiful box that Jack Crave made.

11:16.980 --> 11:17.540
Jack Crave.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.902
Jack Crave fixed the book for me.

11:19.022 --> 11:20.724
Oh, is Jack Crave as your guy?

11:20.744 --> 11:22.646
Jack Crave's been to my house, in a matter of fact.

11:22.666 --> 11:23.347
He's a very nice guy.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.429
He's excellent.

11:25.489 --> 11:25.690
Okay.

11:26.350 --> 11:27.572
Here's another thing.

11:29.174 --> 11:32.578
Doyle had his work pirated extensively.

11:32.678 --> 11:36.482
At the turn of the century, the new copyright law was just coming into effect.

11:36.884 --> 11:41.751
And the Americans were merciless to these British authors, Dickens, Ryder Haggard.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.977
Doyle hated these guys with a passion.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.859
Americans didn't pay royalties.

11:47.879 --> 11:48.881
They paid no royalties.

11:48.901 --> 11:51.704
So here's The Sign of the Four, an old beat-up copy.

11:51.724 --> 11:54.849
It's a pirated edition, which is a reprint.

11:54.869 --> 11:59.055
But this was in Eugene Field's collection, and Eugene Field and Doyle were friends.

11:59.856 --> 12:03.060
This was a copy that Doyle inscribed to Eugene Field,

12:03.395 --> 12:07.481
And then he wrote this and drew this little pirate flag.

12:07.981 --> 12:10.745
And here's this quatrain that he wrote.

12:11.266 --> 12:15.692
This bloody pirate stole my sloop and holds her in his wicked ward.

12:16.192 --> 12:18.916
Lord, send that walking or my poop.

12:19.657 --> 12:24.083
I see him kick along main yard, which means hanging, right, you know.

12:25.285 --> 12:27.327
That's one of the great things.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.752
I mean, these are all just incredible things.

12:31.154 --> 12:35.320
Here's another thing I mentioned to you in the interview.

12:35.340 --> 12:38.786
I'll just give you an example.

12:38.846 --> 12:39.908
Baker Street Fuller.

12:39.928 --> 12:40.088
Right.

12:40.589 --> 12:43.453
These are all letters by Roosevelt.

12:43.713 --> 12:45.376
Remember I told you that Roosevelt was a member?

12:47.319 --> 12:49.623
And this is the printed version of the letters.

12:50.484 --> 12:53.729
And, of course, this book itself is extremely rare.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.094
This is, um...

12:59.065 --> 13:01.027
Copy number one of this book.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.531
Copy number one of these limited things are very scarce.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.734
But in this particular book, it's scarce.

13:08.114 --> 13:10.057
And in here... Are the letters, probably.

13:10.077 --> 13:10.977
Are the letters.

13:11.198 --> 13:11.718
Not all of them.

13:11.738 --> 13:12.519
You can't surprise me.

13:12.599 --> 13:14.581
Exactly.

13:17.284 --> 13:17.945
But some of them.

13:19.627 --> 13:23.831
And they're the most interesting ones.

13:23.851 --> 13:26.794
This one is of great historical significance.

13:27.787 --> 13:28.688
Here's what he says.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.271
Can we read this, dear?

13:31.331 --> 13:32.212
Dear Edgar Smith.

13:32.232 --> 13:33.253
Dear Edgar Smith.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.055
September 21, 44.

13:35.215 --> 13:35.555
Right.

13:36.576 --> 13:42.183
I was delighted to find on my desk your letter and the complimentary bound copy of the Sherlocking Astartes dedicated to Baker Street.

13:42.203 --> 13:55.617
A glance at the foreword and your article entitled The Disappearance of Mr. James Fillmore inspires me with keen anticipation of another trip when that rare moment of relaxation comes, this time in a four-wheeler to Baker Street.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.570
Many thanks for your kindness in presenting this volume to me."

13:59.631 --> 14:05.176
Then, of course, this is interesting, because this is when they were printing this.

14:05.636 --> 14:11.262
This is Eleanor Roosevelt saying, My dear Smith, this is right after Roosevelt's death.

14:11.282 --> 14:18.088
I shall, of course, approve of your printing the letters of which you sent me copies, and I think my husband would have liked to have it done very sincerely yours.

14:19.189 --> 14:25.215
More letters by Eleanor Roosevelt, a letter by Grace Tully, the secretary.

14:25.685 --> 14:29.689
From the same collector?

14:30.050 --> 14:31.531
Well, these I got in different places.

14:32.352 --> 14:33.814
Oh, you've assembled this.

14:33.834 --> 14:34.915
Right, exactly.

14:34.935 --> 14:35.916
This suite of letters.

14:35.936 --> 14:37.017
The suite, exactly.

14:37.898 --> 14:43.744
But all on the same subject, all illustrating their passion with Roosevelt, found in Sherlock Holmes.

14:48.229 --> 14:49.110
It's quite extraordinary.

14:49.850 --> 14:50.571
It really is.

14:50.851 --> 14:52.492
Yeah.

14:52.553 --> 15:02.081
Holmes is a link for people of very, very different... Is it fair to say that you two guys get together because of a shared passion for books?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.963
I mean, I don't want to... No question?

15:03.983 --> 15:04.964
I don't want to... Absolutely.

15:05.024 --> 15:09.789
I don't want to... I'm a personal question, but... No, absolutely.

15:10.229 --> 15:11.811
Priscilla printed her first catalog.

15:11.971 --> 15:13.172
Not that one, actually.

15:13.192 --> 15:14.353
That was our Priscilla's book catalog.

15:14.373 --> 15:15.714
Her first literature catalog.

15:16.435 --> 15:18.777
The very first catalog when she first went into business.

15:19.212 --> 15:27.183
And a mutual friend of ours saw the catalog, showed me the catalog, and there was a book in it that I wanted, and it was being sold too cheaply.

15:28.124 --> 15:33.752
And so I hustled my ass right over, made an appointment, called her up, and of course I got there, the book was sold.

15:33.912 --> 15:36.596
But I took one look at her, and I forgot about the book.

15:37.397 --> 15:44.967
But that doesn't mean anything, because I'm not that fast a mover, as Priscilla has now found out, right?

15:45.841 --> 15:51.711
I didn't call Priscilla for six months, and finally she called me and said, would you like to have some lunch?

15:52.332 --> 15:53.815
I didn't even remember who it was.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.879
And I said, Priscilla?

15:56.460 --> 16:01.629
Yes, I would definitely like to have some lunch.

16:02.370 --> 16:03.692
I'm not going to quit this.

16:03.873 --> 16:04.554
Don't worry about it.

16:04.574 --> 16:06.557
Let me go a little bit further on the Sherlock Holmes.

16:07.479 --> 16:09.823
In addition to collecting what?

16:10.242 --> 16:13.967
Other people might have, okay, these items are unique, but the books aren't unique.

16:14.387 --> 16:15.829
I've heard this record, by the way.

16:16.970 --> 16:23.498
I also have a number of unique items in my collection that there's only one of a kind of, okay?

16:23.559 --> 16:25.901
And they're printed materials.

16:26.622 --> 16:32.510
Many of these are the Library of Congress deposit copies, okay?

16:32.530 --> 16:38.477
And so here's a book that never came out commercially called Western Wanderings by Doyle.

16:38.997 --> 16:43.965
which was deposited for copyright purposes to the Library of Congress.

16:43.985 --> 16:47.791
It was printed, but it was never sold commercially.

16:48.072 --> 16:52.218
It never really sold the issue.

16:52.238 --> 16:55.003
How did this thing manage to escape the Library of Congress?

16:55.023 --> 16:57.186
Well, somebody traded the Library of Congress.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.829
It came out quite legitimately.

16:59.670 --> 17:04.498
Somebody swapped the Library of Congress for stuff that they wanted much more than this.

17:05.120 --> 17:13.491
And subsequently, I bought these from a very legitimate book dealer, a member of the ABAA, and actually very high up in the ABAA.

17:13.511 --> 17:14.232
Here's another one.

17:14.252 --> 17:15.493
This one isn't even bound.

17:16.174 --> 17:20.179
You can see this is what the Library of Congress did to mark their deaccessioning.

17:21.421 --> 17:26.287
And it's just a little story with the Library of Congress call numbers.

17:26.307 --> 17:28.170
And they found their way into my collection.

17:28.670 --> 17:31.414
And then I have one book.

17:32.272 --> 17:34.414
which is the only known book of its kind.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.056
Who picks the fabric for the boxes?

17:37.156 --> 17:37.296
I do.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.898
No, I do that.

17:39.999 --> 17:40.179
Right.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.881
Well, what makes you decide that you want a certain... I don't know.

17:43.002 --> 17:51.990
I suggest to him what kind of book I'd like to have, and then he does the boxes.

17:52.010 --> 17:53.131
These are little parodies.

17:53.151 --> 17:54.452
I love parodies of Holmes.

17:55.132 --> 17:56.534
He's had millions of parodies.

17:57.074 --> 17:57.895
This one is great.

17:59.076 --> 18:01.418
This is the Sleuths, and it contains...

18:01.617 --> 18:06.963
And this is the original Library of Congress deposit card for this.

18:07.724 --> 18:09.707
And I bought this at auction in New York.

18:09.727 --> 18:15.714
And I had to buy the whole set of these to get this one throughout the rest of the set, which had no value.

18:16.214 --> 18:17.295
And this one is incredible.

18:18.677 --> 18:19.798
And here's a pick-lock hole.

18:19.919 --> 18:21.681
Here's another one of Dan's parodies.

18:22.462 --> 18:24.684
This one was written on an exhibition at Harvard.

18:24.784 --> 18:26.406
The Adventures of... Pick-lock Holes.

18:26.546 --> 18:27.928
These are incredibly rare.

18:28.837 --> 18:35.986
But these are even rarer than most copies, because they're all inscribed.

18:37.729 --> 18:38.870
I mean, these are just unheard of.

18:41.073 --> 18:46.720
Look at the condition of the book, too.

18:48.322 --> 18:51.446
That's the author's granddaughter, Martha Peabody.

18:51.466 --> 18:52.147
Could you read it?

18:52.167 --> 18:54.010
It's Martha Peabody from R.C.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.633
Layman, Xmas, 1901.

18:57.052 --> 19:02.817
And I've never heard in all the years of my collection of any other inscribed copies.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.221
That's one of the parodies there.

19:07.241 --> 19:08.062
Except this one.

19:09.603 --> 19:12.125
So there are two inscribed copies in the world.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.847
And I have them both.

19:14.187 --> 19:14.647
Two known.

19:14.908 --> 19:15.548
Two known ones.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.110
Rosamond P. Byron's sister.

19:17.130 --> 19:18.150
Don't ever say they were only two.

19:18.171 --> 19:18.751
Two known, two known.

19:18.771 --> 19:20.533
It's like they're only 10 Tamerlanes.

19:20.713 --> 19:21.694
Only two known.

19:21.854 --> 19:23.195
And then the 12th, right?

19:23.235 --> 19:26.738
This is a birthday present that I got for Danny.

19:26.937 --> 19:28.679
Ralph Sipper turned this up.

19:31.022 --> 19:34.706
Now, I also collect the rarest detective fiction, okay?

19:34.726 --> 19:36.108
He collects Queen's Quorum titles.

19:36.288 --> 19:36.508
Right.

19:38.331 --> 19:44.558
Dan already had this book in his collection, but the copy that he had was not nearly as beautiful as this one.

19:44.578 --> 19:53.228
I bought this book, not this particular one, but I bought my first copy from Lou Feldman, and I paid, I think, $100 from Lou Feldman.

19:53.268 --> 19:54.750
It was from the K collection.

19:55.253 --> 20:04.429
And that was the only copy I saw for years, until Priscilla turned this copy up at Ralph Zipper's, and she bought it for me for a birthday present.

20:04.449 --> 20:09.617
The same thing, these books are all great detective fiction.

20:09.637 --> 20:10.679
This one is incredible.

20:10.719 --> 20:12.783
Look at the jacket on this.

20:15.347 --> 20:21.177
This is the Queen's Quorum title, too, and this one has a nice sign by the author, Thomas Burke.

20:23.401 --> 20:28.767
I mean, is there a better collection than this, in your own humble opinion, of this?

20:29.067 --> 20:35.313
Well, of Sherlock Holmes, in book and in letters, there isn't any.

20:36.835 --> 20:37.075
Okay?

20:37.095 --> 20:38.417
This is a preeminent collection.

20:38.737 --> 20:38.997
Right.

20:39.658 --> 20:44.063
I think that most people, well, most people would agree if they saw it.

20:44.443 --> 20:48.227
Remember, there have probably been two people that have seen this collection.

20:48.832 --> 20:49.433
to see that.

20:49.493 --> 20:50.494
I'm so privileged.

20:50.534 --> 20:52.357
I really... No, don't feel privileged.

20:52.437 --> 20:54.360
I do, because... It's not my thing.

20:54.460 --> 21:00.568
I just haven't... You're interested, so I'm enthusiastic about it, and I'm very happy... Do you have a catalog?

21:00.588 --> 21:01.089
No.

21:01.109 --> 21:02.491
I'm in the process of cataloging.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.333
You should catalog it.

21:04.353 --> 21:06.476
What is it that's about?

21:06.836 --> 21:07.918
That's there someplace.

21:08.839 --> 21:10.401
No, it's on the other one.

21:10.421 --> 21:12.344
Over there?

21:12.364 --> 21:13.205
Yeah.

21:13.225 --> 21:14.787
Is it under the... Yeah.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.490
Now, here are some great books.

21:16.510 --> 21:16.830
I mean,

21:17.333 --> 21:28.469
If you remember at the fair, Mark Hyman, a dealer from California, had a couple of Sherlock Holmes books.

21:28.489 --> 21:31.934
These are the first and second issues of The Sign of the Four.

21:33.076 --> 21:34.698
Now, the thing about this is condition.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.970
Now, Mark's book, which he sold at the fair for $13,500,

21:43.186 --> 21:46.830
was not nearly, didn't even begin to compare with this copy.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.412
This is the finest known copy.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.694
There's no question about it.

21:52.557 --> 21:55.881
Oh, I'll find it for you.

21:55.901 --> 21:56.562
One second.

21:56.842 --> 21:58.724
And I love condition.

21:58.804 --> 22:07.334
And so I've made a real passion of finding these books in great condition.

22:07.895 --> 22:08.976
This is another single.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.358
My God.

22:10.490 --> 22:13.334
This is the White Company, a novel in a three-decker by Doyle.

22:13.754 --> 22:15.016
He's 19th century.

22:15.477 --> 22:21.885
And you say these were all issued with jackets, even if they were plain wrappers.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.468
Well, the three-decker one wasn't.

22:23.488 --> 22:25.250
This one was probably issued in a jacket.

22:25.270 --> 22:28.014
Do you think it had anything pictorial on it, or was it just a plain wrapper?

22:28.034 --> 22:28.655
I don't think this one did.

22:29.416 --> 22:33.381
Some did, but I don't believe that this one did.

22:33.401 --> 22:36.345
And then, you know, I'm sort of working my way towards...

22:37.827 --> 22:41.493
the cornerstones of the collections, which is what we're getting to.

22:42.254 --> 22:44.938
Quite literally, we're on the upper shelf, moving left.

22:45.118 --> 22:48.323
And I skipped a whole lot of stuff in here, a lot of great stuff.

22:49.224 --> 22:54.292
But The Sign of the Floor, that's the first legitimate issue in England.

22:54.552 --> 23:01.082
But there was a previous issue that was published in the United States in a pirate edition, which is impossible to find.

23:01.503 --> 23:05.189
And this one is incredibly rare, especially because of the condition.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.771
It has the complete back strip.

23:07.173 --> 23:13.940
And when you get into this rarefied atmosphere, the backstrip is really important because it's the first thing that goes, believe it or not.

23:14.061 --> 23:14.581
I know that.

23:14.821 --> 23:23.050
So the difference between this copy and a lesser one with no backstrip is like $8,000 difference just for the backstrip.

23:23.091 --> 23:24.052
Published by Collier.

23:24.172 --> 23:24.472
Exactly.

23:24.492 --> 23:25.573
That's the same guy.

23:25.593 --> 23:26.634
That's the same Collier.

23:26.674 --> 23:27.896
It's 1891.

23:28.016 --> 23:28.416
Right.

23:28.436 --> 23:32.120
Exactly.

23:32.321 --> 23:37.146
And then just working our way down, this is the first book edition.

23:38.864 --> 23:41.167
of A Study in Scarlet, which is the first book.

23:44.791 --> 23:48.356
This is the English style, by the way, of box making.

23:48.376 --> 23:51.380
You see, it's a totally different style.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.642
Do you have why they're getting this open?

23:53.662 --> 23:55.284
Do you have any of Doyle's own books?

23:56.105 --> 23:57.487
No, I don't.

23:58.188 --> 24:03.875
And there was a collection of Doyle's own books, but not Sherlock Holmes, and I was not interested in those.

24:03.935 --> 24:05.097
I do have a few, actually.

24:05.597 --> 24:06.018
Yeah, I do.

24:06.218 --> 24:08.601
You're not interested in any of his non-Sherlock Holmes books?

24:09.121 --> 24:11.945
Oh, I am, but I mean, do I have a book?

24:11.965 --> 24:13.567
That was the question.

24:13.587 --> 24:15.070
Oh, I do, yeah, I do.

24:15.190 --> 24:17.994
Do you want to know about the current book plate?

24:18.014 --> 24:19.456
This is an incredible thing.

24:20.317 --> 24:23.802
And that condition for that book, again, it's the finest known product.

24:23.842 --> 24:26.546
Now, is this, what is this, a little mildew there?

24:26.766 --> 24:29.911
Foxing, exactly the way it came, and it's exactly, it's been like that.

24:29.931 --> 24:31.072
Have you treated it?

24:31.092 --> 24:35.719
No, it's been like that since probably 20 years after it was issued.

24:39.395 --> 24:44.143
That's an incredible book.

24:44.804 --> 24:45.926
How long have you had that?

24:46.447 --> 24:47.929
Three or four years.

24:48.670 --> 24:49.752
So you're still working on this.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.615
This is a very active collection.

24:51.635 --> 24:55.362
This is a live, completely live collection.

24:55.382 --> 24:57.445
This is the cornerstone of any collection.

24:57.645 --> 25:01.792
Not necessarily the most valuable book, but very valuable.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.677
But this is the Beaton's Christmas Angle.

25:05.618 --> 25:07.461
And this is the most photographed book.

25:07.481 --> 25:08.983
I mean, Priscilla can show you a T-shirt.

25:09.003 --> 25:09.845
Study in Scarlet.

25:09.885 --> 25:10.586
Which I did.

25:11.467 --> 25:14.092
And this is the first appearance of Holmes in print.

25:15.153 --> 25:17.277
And this is all that's left of this back strip.

25:17.417 --> 25:18.719
The A is missing.

25:20.161 --> 25:20.943
It's intact.

25:20.963 --> 25:21.824
But it's intact.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.647
And this is one of the finest copies now.

25:24.468 --> 25:26.952
Not the finest, but one of the finest.

25:26.972 --> 25:28.154
And you acquired that where?

25:28.715 --> 25:31.840
And I acquired that about two or three years ago.

25:31.860 --> 25:32.201
Wow.

25:32.221 --> 25:32.301
Wow.

25:33.479 --> 25:41.046
Is this opportunity, I mean, are these just things that you've just found within the last two or three years, or are things that you've just been able to afford in the last two or three years?

25:41.347 --> 25:44.129
Well, affording is part of it, but some of these have not appeared.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.412
And the collection goes way back.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.494
This collection goes back 35 years.

25:49.154 --> 25:53.699
So some of these, for instance, this Valley of Fear that I showed you is a rather old book.

25:53.719 --> 25:57.823
These adventures and memoirs, the first edition of the adventures, first edition of the memoirs, are old.

25:58.343 --> 25:59.845
These are inscribed by Doyle.

26:00.505 --> 26:01.326
These are old.

26:01.913 --> 26:06.519
I haven't shown you a lot of things, but... Well, what do you really covet?

26:06.599 --> 26:07.199
It's not here.

26:07.340 --> 26:08.941
I mean, two or three years.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.103
You said the living collection.

26:10.383 --> 26:11.164
Not covet.

26:11.184 --> 26:14.668
That's the wrong word, but... Let's put it this way.

26:14.688 --> 26:17.712
When you go to a big fair like New York or something in London, what are you looking for?

26:17.772 --> 26:18.973
Then I look for parodies.

26:19.114 --> 26:21.456
The only thing I can find there are parodies.

26:21.577 --> 26:23.699
I love parodies of Holmes.

26:23.779 --> 26:26.082
Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.242
They're very rare in themselves.

26:28.422 --> 26:29.384
These are all parodies.

26:29.404 --> 26:31.506
This is a parody, The Eleven Tough Buttons.

26:31.586 --> 26:37.934
Here's a whole book of parodies and misadventures, spooks, misfits, the sleuths, Carrington's Cases.

26:37.974 --> 26:44.302
I mean, if you want to see condition for a book, I mean, this is just incredible for this particular book.

26:44.322 --> 26:44.822
Carrington's Cases, yeah.

26:45.423 --> 26:47.606
And it has a homeless parody in it.

26:47.626 --> 26:52.231
And these are very, they're not only collectible, but they're very difficult to find.

26:52.251 --> 26:55.275
And, of course, they're worth a lot of money.

26:56.538 --> 27:02.107
So in terms of the core collection, the A-Adams, you pretty well have the whole shelf on them.

27:02.127 --> 27:02.868
I have the whole shelf.

27:03.069 --> 27:03.569
Yeah.

27:03.589 --> 27:03.990
Right.

27:04.010 --> 27:06.574
I'm still looking for a little thing to fill in here and there.

27:06.995 --> 27:10.721
I'm always upgrading in terms of condition constantly.

27:11.382 --> 27:18.794
But here's a book like this, the first American edition of The Hound of the Baskervilles, the first true American edition, which is a very scarce book.

27:18.814 --> 27:20.917
I'm still looking for that in jacket.

27:20.937 --> 27:21.598
Okay?

27:21.618 --> 27:23.862
Here's a book that I got recently in jacket.

27:24.415 --> 27:28.300
This is the only known copy in a jacket, The Return of Sherlock Holmes.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.461
It's a late book.

27:29.481 --> 27:33.467
It's 1905, and it is the only known copy in a jacket.

27:33.487 --> 27:34.027
From a dealer?

27:34.728 --> 27:35.649
From a dealer, right.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.572
Do you remember what you thought when you saw it?

27:38.112 --> 27:39.254
Yeah, I went wild.

27:39.274 --> 27:39.935
I think it fell.

27:42.158 --> 27:44.841
Did you see it in the catalog, or did you just kind of walk into a shop?

27:45.482 --> 27:47.164
People know what I collect.

27:47.805 --> 27:48.386
Here's a book.

27:48.446 --> 27:50.288
I mean, you want to talk about a book?

27:50.622 --> 27:52.464
The dealer is an odd book.

27:52.484 --> 27:54.465
Take advantage of that kind of obsession, though.

27:54.485 --> 27:56.807
Sometimes, yeah.

27:57.047 --> 27:57.668
But you know what?

27:58.168 --> 27:58.629
You know what?

27:59.129 --> 28:01.291
My position is I always know more than the dealer.

28:02.552 --> 28:08.177
So if I buy a book and I pay for it, if it's in my field, I'm going to get the better of the deal.

28:08.897 --> 28:09.658
Well, you've got the book.

28:09.678 --> 28:13.821
But the dealer never knows what the real value is, and I've got the book.

28:13.841 --> 28:14.342
Exactly.

28:15.483 --> 28:16.784
This is a wonderful story.

28:16.844 --> 28:20.427
This is a book full of Doyle letters.

28:20.795 --> 28:23.920
Now that says My Dear Watson, but it's not My Dear Watson.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.884
These are all Doyle materials and Doyle letters.

28:27.765 --> 28:30.028
Here's Arthur Conan Doyle and his son.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.851
Isn't that wonderful?

28:35.396 --> 28:37.119
That's Doyle at the end of his life.

28:37.599 --> 28:40.003
That's his inscription, life's pilgrimage.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.428
Let me read you this letter.

28:44.229 --> 28:45.190
This comes from Rhoda.

28:46.873 --> 28:48.976
I'm going to see Anthony.

28:49.036 --> 28:50.498
This is dated November

28:51.220 --> 28:52.661
21st, 1940.

28:52.781 --> 28:57.906
Temporary address, and I'll tell you why in a minute, 8 Burlington Gardens.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.910
My dear mister, and I won't repeat the name because I don't want to mention it.

29:02.450 --> 29:11.619
Very many thanks for your cabled order of October 30th for the Doyle album and cobbler's campaigning, and for your confirmatory letter of November 1st just received.

29:12.119 --> 29:18.645
The reason why the Doyle item was not sent immediately is that it suffered slightly in the bombing of Bodley House.

29:19.098 --> 29:21.200
The cloth binding was lightly stained.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.063
Fortunately, the contents came to no harm.

29:24.643 --> 29:34.813
I wanted to keep the volume back for inspection by the insurance law's assessors, but as it seems that they may not be here for weeks yet, I think I had better send you the item at once.

29:35.294 --> 29:46.084
I thought of having it rebound in the same style, but then I thought, you might not find it uninteresting to have in your library one book which bears the honorable scars of the Battle of Britain.

29:46.958 --> 29:50.322
And I thought that letter, to me, this is in value.

29:50.382 --> 29:51.683
It's not that great in value.

29:51.844 --> 29:56.449
But to have that book, it just gives you a wonderful feeling.

29:57.650 --> 29:59.693
You know, I've heard this all of them.

29:59.713 --> 30:03.577
A very dear friend of mine, now deceased, who actually started me as a book collector.

30:03.637 --> 30:04.718
He used to be the music critic.

30:06.200 --> 30:06.761
He had that.

30:06.781 --> 30:08.002
He played it for me one night.

30:08.022 --> 30:12.287
And it is arguably the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.

30:13.128 --> 30:13.989
Have you seen this one?

30:14.129 --> 30:15.731
This is a gift from Peter Stern.

30:15.911 --> 30:16.712
Peter Stern.

30:17.317 --> 30:27.631
One of the things which are also touching, these are World War I journals, prisoner of war camp journals.

30:27.651 --> 30:28.873
The camp was Ruhleben.

30:29.934 --> 30:31.556
R-U-H-L.

30:32.878 --> 30:33.178
L-E-B-E-N.

30:33.719 --> 30:37.144
And it was a very famous prisoner of war camp where the British were held prisoner.

30:37.284 --> 30:37.744
Infamous.

30:37.845 --> 30:42.311
And it was a huge camp, probably 25,000 people in the camp.

30:42.511 --> 30:43.392
Ran for miles.

30:43.709 --> 30:48.276
And they developed their own colleges and their own universities within the camp.

30:48.296 --> 30:51.841
And they put on all these various shows.

30:52.482 --> 30:54.766
And, of course, there's quite a bit about Holmes.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.812
Here's The Speckled Band by A. Conan Doyle.

30:59.252 --> 31:01.716
So the whole thing is full of material on Sherlock Holmes.

31:02.357 --> 31:10.189
What makes this so interesting is this copy was bound by someone in the camp and sent back home.

31:11.941 --> 31:15.985
This is to who it was sent, and he was the binder, Ernest Long.

31:17.446 --> 31:21.250
And again, this is the only known copy in a camp binding.

31:21.951 --> 31:22.892
They set up a bindery.

31:22.952 --> 31:26.315
And you've marked these pages for it, because those are where the Holmes things are.

31:26.335 --> 31:27.476
Yeah, exactly.

31:27.496 --> 31:32.101
This is the little binder's ticket right here to be sent to.

31:34.423 --> 31:36.986
And here's a copy that is bound in a regular binding.

31:37.626 --> 31:38.127
Same thing.

31:38.147 --> 31:41.290
But it's very scarce to begin with.

31:42.839 --> 31:48.567
Then you have to buy some copies from his own collection.

31:48.588 --> 31:50.631
I'll just show you.

31:50.651 --> 31:52.093
A collection, a library, I guess.

31:52.113 --> 31:52.513
Library.

31:52.533 --> 31:56.800
Let's see if I can find something.

31:56.860 --> 31:57.781
You don't have to show me.

31:57.881 --> 31:59.964
I was just curious if you had any.

31:59.984 --> 32:04.611
Well, they're interesting because they have his notations on it.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.614
Are the slippers anything, or are they just slippers?

32:08.437 --> 32:10.500
Well, he kept his tobacco.

32:10.987 --> 32:13.130
He kept his tobacco when the person slipped.

32:13.150 --> 32:15.354
I figured it had to have reason to be on that show.

32:15.554 --> 32:22.604
This is a wonderful finding, again, done by the critics.

32:22.945 --> 32:29.515
It's a book that I had been looking for for years called How to Do It, a Sherlock Holmes parody.

32:30.136 --> 32:37.146
Again, because I'm such a condition freak, it's a great condition jacket and has a shark on the parody.

32:38.408 --> 32:43.174
It's got a little statue, a little, we can call it a statue, we would call it.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.436
A little leather holmes on the spine.

32:44.456 --> 32:52.768
A little leather holmes on the spine, which I've never seen anything quite like it before.

32:52.788 --> 32:59.376
Some of these are just, these covers, some of these jackets are just magnificent.

32:59.397 --> 33:00.698
They look brand new, don't they, really?

33:00.718 --> 33:02.661
There's an addition in this book.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.665
The Land of the Mist?

33:06.978 --> 33:12.266
Even these later books, for instance, and large books, they all have jackets.

33:12.326 --> 33:19.076
They're all... Then there's, let's see, There's a Lost World.

33:23.142 --> 33:23.522
Spectacular.

33:23.542 --> 33:27.448
So these are just, as I say, this is years of collecting.

33:27.488 --> 33:31.054
These are things you're just not ever going to see.

33:31.074 --> 33:33.016
What do you foresee with this collection?

33:33.036 --> 33:34.098
I mean, that's not a fair... I don't know.

33:34.378 --> 33:36.782
I haven't even started thinking about it.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.868
I think mostly because I don't want to think about it.

33:39.888 --> 33:41.069
No, then there's no reason why you should.

33:41.109 --> 33:44.634
I mean, William Scheide didn't like the question either.

33:44.654 --> 33:47.098
And he's all learning stuff is in Princeton.

33:47.318 --> 33:49.561
And he said it's not a sure thing, by the way.

33:49.601 --> 33:50.262
This is great.

33:51.464 --> 34:02.359
This is a book that I frequent Arnold Silverman's store, Goodspeed's on Milk Street, although I haven't been there in probably two or three years.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.503
But this is a book I found on his Tencent bookshelf.

34:06.260 --> 34:08.523
This is probably worth $700 or $800.

34:08.924 --> 34:09.925
It is, believe it or not.

34:10.366 --> 34:14.712
I know it's a phrase that's overused, but this one is in the original glassine.

34:15.793 --> 34:17.676
And you can see it because it's in mint.

34:17.696 --> 34:18.917
The book is in mint edition.

34:19.759 --> 34:20.820
You got that for a dime?

34:20.840 --> 34:21.361
A dime.

34:21.381 --> 34:23.344
Ten cents on his shelf.

34:23.364 --> 34:24.966
And this is the only edition.

34:25.026 --> 34:25.887
It was only printed.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.389
And how long ago was this?

34:28.010 --> 34:30.493
Just about eight years ago, nine years ago.

34:30.513 --> 34:32.436
What's your feeling when you see something like that?

34:32.551 --> 34:33.913
I can't believe it.

34:34.313 --> 34:36.596
But you can't betray this.

34:36.616 --> 34:36.956
No.

34:36.996 --> 34:38.979
You go in and you pay a dime.

34:39.940 --> 34:41.862
You absolutely pay a dime.

34:41.882 --> 34:42.643
And get out of there.

34:42.743 --> 34:43.564
And get out of there.

34:43.684 --> 34:44.946
And giggle the whole one.

34:45.126 --> 34:45.947
These books here.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.829
Did you know it instantly when you saw it?

34:48.870 --> 34:49.070
Instantly.

34:49.090 --> 34:50.452
These are all farther brown.

34:51.433 --> 34:54.276
These are very scarce in jacket.

34:54.297 --> 34:56.339
You know, I collect detective fiction.

34:56.359 --> 34:58.341
These I bought in a rare book dealer's shop.

34:59.142 --> 35:01.545
I paid $15 and $20 a piece for these.

35:01.913 --> 35:03.635
at the Strand Rare Bookshop.

35:04.336 --> 35:11.043
They had just come in as a collection, and I bought them from a guy who is now his own business.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.585
I bought them from Glenn Horowitz.

35:13.586 --> 35:15.128
Who one used to work at the Strand.

35:15.168 --> 35:15.608
Right.

35:15.628 --> 35:18.952
Who had no idea what he had and thought that he knew everything.

35:18.972 --> 35:19.973
One thinks he knows everything.

35:19.993 --> 35:20.233
I'm amazed.

35:20.253 --> 35:21.635
He still thinks he knows everything.

35:21.655 --> 35:24.938
Now, he's made a lot of money, but I guarantee you he doesn't know everything.

35:25.779 --> 35:27.061
No one knows everything.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.242
No, no one knows everything.

35:28.677 --> 35:34.424
I like books that really have a unique touch to them, and that's what I look for.

35:34.444 --> 35:56.170
This is a very famous detective story writer, R. Austin Freeman, but he did, his first book was really a travel book, and he did it in a very scholarly way, and it's touching because this is a copy of the Hien Squad to his mother, and I have several books of that kind of, Agatha Christie's first book,

35:56.757 --> 35:58.619
which is inscribed to her father.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.907
I have Marjorie Allingham's first book inscribed to her father saying, please go out and buy more copies of these books.

36:05.507 --> 36:09.692
I like things that are a little bit off the track.

36:12.115 --> 36:13.196
Those are pretty nice.

36:13.217 --> 36:16.781
These are all... You got those from the Strand, huh, Glenn Hall?

36:16.881 --> 36:19.224
Yeah, these particular ones, right.

36:19.244 --> 36:23.829
But this is a collection of Friedman, which is probably one of the greatest collections.

36:23.929 --> 36:26.292
Most of these are inscribed.

36:26.660 --> 36:28.842
This one, this isn't a jacket.

36:29.923 --> 36:31.525
Believe it or not, that's the jacket.

36:32.706 --> 36:37.130
Let me show you the book so you don't get a kick out of why the jacket is so neat.

36:37.471 --> 36:38.492
Here's the book.

36:38.512 --> 36:39.272
Here's the jacket.

36:39.773 --> 36:45.158
You can't even tell that it's a jacket.

36:45.178 --> 36:54.948
I know I'd like to find it myself.

36:55.548 --> 36:56.329
It'll turn up.

36:56.849 --> 37:02.154
Well, it's with my other, maybe in the other room.

37:02.174 --> 37:02.334
Yeah.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.836
Take a look on this.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.778
Don't forget to put your dime book back.

37:13.445 --> 37:14.426
This place is enormous.

37:19.852 --> 37:19.952
Yeah.

37:19.972 --> 37:20.072
Yeah.

37:20.092 --> 37:20.993
It's all over the place.

37:21.634 --> 37:23.976
This is more great though, isn't it?

37:24.016 --> 37:26.198
This is a very funny story.

37:26.532 --> 37:29.175
This is the only Seminar title that's on his form.

37:30.417 --> 37:35.103
I don't know about thousands of books or how many hundreds of books that Seminar wrote.

37:35.784 --> 37:39.429
I used to deal with Seminar when I was at Harcourt.

37:40.711 --> 37:42.913
He just died, didn't he?

37:42.934 --> 37:43.755
Yeah, a couple of years ago.

37:43.775 --> 37:46.178
Maybe more recently than that, I think.

37:46.198 --> 37:46.698
You know what?

37:46.759 --> 37:48.200
The light is after me.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.443
Where is the light?

37:50.463 --> 37:51.605
I don't know.

37:51.625 --> 37:54.008
This came up in an auction lot at one of Sotheby's sales.

37:54.595 --> 38:02.406
This with all the first, a hundred other Simenon titles, usually the first edition in English of most of his May Gray novels.

38:02.806 --> 38:09.054
And I bought the whole lot for what seemed to me a very reasonable amount of money for all of those books.

38:09.615 --> 38:14.522
And I got this first edition of the only Queen's Quarm title of Simenon.

38:14.542 --> 38:18.788
And I thought, well, gee, you know, I wonder if he remembers me.

38:18.808 --> 38:20.149
Maybe I'll ask him to unscribe it.

38:20.169 --> 38:22.813
So I called, I wrote Helen Wolfe, who was his,

38:23.502 --> 38:32.492
publisher at Harcourt, you know, Helen Woolf, had a co-publishing venture with their own imprint.

38:32.512 --> 38:40.161
And Helen Woolf was retired up in New Hampshire, and she said, sure, she remembered me, and she'd write to Simenon to see if it was okay if I wrote him.

38:40.602 --> 38:46.168
So I wrote him a letter, and because she said, fine, go ahead, I wrote him a letter, he wrote back and said, yes, by all means, send the book.

38:46.418 --> 38:48.000
So I wrapped it up very carefully.

38:48.942 --> 38:53.148
We even got Swiss stamps for the right amount of posters, so the man had to do nothing.

38:53.468 --> 38:54.890
You know, put tape in the box.

38:54.910 --> 38:56.272
That's the way you do it, yeah.

38:56.853 --> 38:58.375
But I told him to inscribe it to Dan.

38:58.395 --> 38:59.577
Oh, look, I can see the inscription.

38:59.597 --> 39:00.738
Inscribe it to Dan.

39:00.758 --> 39:03.602
But I'm the one who is buying the book, you understand.

39:03.622 --> 39:05.365
And I said, please inscribe it to Dan.

39:05.805 --> 39:06.607
Here's what he writes.

39:07.047 --> 39:10.732
So it's a very effusive inscription.

39:10.793 --> 39:13.236
I mean, it was...

39:13.790 --> 39:17.394
ebullient homage to the author.

39:17.454 --> 39:18.194
Yeah.

39:18.214 --> 39:18.575
Of course.

39:18.595 --> 39:20.196
Yeah.

39:20.436 --> 39:22.779
And it's very nice.

39:23.339 --> 39:26.322
I mean, the inscription is— Well, what he did was— Are you miffed?

39:26.683 --> 39:26.903
No.

39:27.263 --> 39:30.506
To make a long story short, he has very good taste.

39:30.667 --> 39:33.709
He remembered what Porcelain looked like, let me tell you.

39:33.729 --> 39:35.611
Well, he was known to be a bit of a woman, I think.

39:35.631 --> 39:35.832
Right.

39:35.852 --> 39:36.492
Oh, really?

39:36.813 --> 39:39.375
You couldn't tell from the inscription, right?

39:39.558 --> 39:41.920
But I do love Simenon, just the same.

39:42.221 --> 39:44.023
And these are other Simenons.

39:44.043 --> 39:48.027
And inscribed, inscribed Simenons are the utmost rarity.

39:48.107 --> 39:49.088
Really, because he doesn't do them?

39:49.128 --> 39:50.109
He never did them.

39:50.129 --> 39:51.971
These are wonderful.

39:55.014 --> 39:57.237
Jack Kramer loves you.

39:57.637 --> 39:58.478
For their condition.

39:58.658 --> 40:02.682
These, the condition of these books is completely unbelievable.

40:02.722 --> 40:04.124
Oh, boy.

40:04.865 --> 40:07.668
I mean, this is just like... No, it's a K copy?

40:07.748 --> 40:09.109
Yeah, yeah, both K copies.

40:09.477 --> 40:11.099
So that means it came from Lou.

40:11.479 --> 40:13.301
Yeah, this is all Lou Feldman, by the way.

40:14.282 --> 40:16.344
I'll show you books that came from Lou Feldman.

40:16.425 --> 40:20.129
Anything with a K book plate meant that Lou Feldman.

40:22.171 --> 40:22.852
It was his book?

40:23.272 --> 40:23.973
No, he sold it.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.915
But he put his book plate in there?

40:25.935 --> 40:30.560
No, he put this collection together called Mr. and Mrs. K. I'm sorry, okay.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.262
But look at the quality of these books.

40:32.622 --> 40:35.866
Isn't that beautiful?

40:35.886 --> 40:38.108
But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

40:38.349 --> 40:38.809
This one.

40:39.397 --> 40:40.638
There's another one from Lou.

40:43.441 --> 40:49.106
This is one of the scarcest-known pieces of detective fiction, written under a pseudonym.

40:49.126 --> 40:51.388
This is really Richard Austin Freeman, the same guy.

40:51.408 --> 40:54.111
I think the pseudonym is Clifford Ashton.

40:54.171 --> 40:55.812
A-S-H-R-E-O-W-M.

40:56.052 --> 40:57.914
This is one of the rarest pieces.

40:57.954 --> 40:59.596
There's probably 15 known copies.

41:00.176 --> 41:02.358
Again, more from Lou.

41:02.378 --> 41:07.463
And here's a postcard that tells you this is the guy who discovered

41:07.932 --> 41:12.658
Clifford Ashdown was a student in this particular guy, Percival Stone.

41:12.678 --> 41:18.666
And so this is a card that is laid in describing what the student is.

41:18.686 --> 41:22.732
If you want to see condition again, always condition.

41:23.212 --> 41:24.714
Condition is everything.

41:24.734 --> 41:26.396
Here's another one of Lou's books.

41:27.878 --> 41:32.464
This is one of the greatest books I own for its rarity and conditioning.

41:32.484 --> 41:36.690
This is The Red Thumb Mark of Clark Austin Freeman and the original Glass Seed.

41:37.970 --> 41:39.912
That's the condition of the book, 1908.

41:42.235 --> 41:46.200
These books are, really, I'm telling you, I'm not exaggerating.

41:46.220 --> 41:47.482
They're virtually unheard of.

41:48.122 --> 41:51.346
And they're really unheard of because nobody's ever seen them.

41:51.807 --> 41:52.588
How do you make sense?

41:52.608 --> 41:53.989
Is this how you enjoy the course?

41:54.010 --> 41:55.431
I'm dying of starvation.

41:55.451 --> 41:56.593
It's one of the nine.

41:56.813 --> 41:59.056
Okay, we're going.

41:59.076 --> 42:00.017
I'll stop here.

42:00.417 --> 42:00.978
Okay.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.062
To me, this is what I love.

42:04.362 --> 42:06.745
I could look at these books all day.

42:07.130 --> 42:09.212
and I enjoy them over and over again.

42:09.232 --> 42:10.734
You can't read them, though, obviously.

42:10.954 --> 42:12.395
No, but I've read the stories.

42:12.896 --> 42:14.778
Everything in English I have read.

42:15.198 --> 42:16.499
I've read all of these stories.

42:17.881 --> 42:18.862
He was a great writer.

42:18.922 --> 42:21.284
He was what we call a procedural writer.

42:21.745 --> 42:24.427
In other words, he'd go do his research, just like you're doing.

42:24.507 --> 42:25.749
What's all that stuff in itself?

42:25.769 --> 42:26.369
That's Priscilla's.

42:26.489 --> 42:27.891
That's all French.

42:27.911 --> 42:30.994
And that's really part of Priscilla's English story.

42:32.275 --> 42:32.375
Okay.

42:32.395 --> 42:34.217
These are all from Lou.

42:34.602 --> 42:37.666
This is the guy who wrote The Phantom of the Opera, Gaston La Rue.

42:37.686 --> 42:38.247
Oh, that's great.

42:38.287 --> 42:42.973
And these are all original materials in French, in beautiful condition, the same as the seminaries.

42:46.658 --> 42:49.442
I can shut this guy off, right?

42:49.462 --> 42:52.926
This collection would be complete without these.

42:53.046 --> 42:54.769
And I get it.

42:54.789 --> 42:56.191
I see a Victor red label.

42:56.211 --> 42:57.252
That's Conan Doyle.

42:57.586 --> 43:00.409
recorded, the only known recordings of Doyle.

43:00.469 --> 43:02.671
With the original jackets.

43:03.271 --> 43:07.956
Don't touch the grooves now, just be very careful.

43:07.976 --> 43:09.377
And what does he think about?

43:10.118 --> 43:12.560
About his life and Sherlock Holmes.

43:12.620 --> 43:16.804
Now what you should do is record it on tape and then never put a needle on it again.

43:16.824 --> 43:20.308
These are William Gillette recordings.

43:21.108 --> 43:22.790
This is of William Gillette.

43:22.810 --> 43:24.792
So the two of them together, both

43:25.261 --> 43:32.048
You know what, you should take this to a pro with a really very delicate, I'm just asking this to take them for you.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.470
So you can just listen to them.

43:35.592 --> 43:36.913
Have you heard, have you listened to them?

43:38.054 --> 43:38.295
No.

43:38.695 --> 43:39.336
Well, let's see.

43:39.356 --> 43:43.860
Yes, and he's afraid to listen to them.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.642
Now tell me what that slipper is once for.

43:46.023 --> 43:49.326
This is where Sherlock Holmes kept his tobacco, in a Persian slipper.

43:49.646 --> 43:52.129
You know, Texas had the socks he wore when he died.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.064
Did you know that?

43:53.104 --> 43:53.285
No.

43:53.726 --> 43:54.106
They do.

43:54.126 --> 43:55.489
Yeah, that's one of the big things.

43:55.509 --> 43:56.331
I'll show you.

43:56.391 --> 43:59.958
It's like they got it from Newfoundland.

43:59.978 --> 44:02.724
I'm sorry, from Texas, Newfoundland.

44:02.744 --> 44:04.788
Right here.

44:04.808 --> 44:05.289
Right here.

44:05.369 --> 44:07.554
The BBC spooked them for that, in a matter of fact.

44:07.574 --> 44:08.055
See this?

44:08.075 --> 44:08.616
Oh, yeah, that's great.

44:09.018 --> 44:12.704
This doll was made in 1899, December of 1899.

44:12.724 --> 44:14.066
That's a Sherlock Holmes doll.

44:14.086 --> 44:19.814
This is the costumer for William Gillette in his first performance made that doll.

44:19.834 --> 44:21.036
That's much better than this doll.

44:21.056 --> 44:26.164
And a lady from Connecticut called up Kenny Gloss and said she had this for sale.

44:27.546 --> 44:33.695
She was the maid to Faith Baldwin, the writer, who was the mistress of William Gillette.

44:34.737 --> 44:38.282
So it was handed down to her when Faith Baldwin died.

44:39.005 --> 44:40.367
She didn't know what to do with it.

44:40.387 --> 44:43.771
And Kenny, thanks to him, called me up immediately.

44:43.791 --> 44:44.833
You've got to have the network.

44:44.853 --> 44:47.156
And I bought this from that woman.

44:47.176 --> 44:48.418
The Jaguar, what's that?

44:48.438 --> 44:49.019
Cheetah.

44:49.119 --> 44:50.481
That's Dan's tradition.

44:50.501 --> 44:52.664
That's my position in the speckled band.

44:52.684 --> 44:55.467
Dan is the cheetah of the speckled band.

44:55.487 --> 45:02.477
Rimesby Roilock, the villain of the speckled band, had a cheetah and a baboon rooming in town.

45:02.737 --> 45:03.118
Please, please.

45:03.138 --> 45:05.561
Yeah, don't get me started.

45:05.581 --> 45:08.505
So far we've been talking about books, but don't get into charge.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.821
This is more than you want to know.

45:10.861 --> 45:11.587
No, it's not.

45:11.889 --> 45:12.977
You should be surprised.
