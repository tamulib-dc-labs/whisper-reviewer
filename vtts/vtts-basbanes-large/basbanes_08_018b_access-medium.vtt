00:04.638 --> 00:10.006
The perception of the book, I think, is very important, too.

00:10.026 --> 00:15.053
You certainly don't want people to consider this kind of a father-dearest kind of a book in any way.

00:15.113 --> 00:18.639
This is not a condemnation, I don't think.

00:18.679 --> 00:19.580
No, no.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.905
In fact, I was very careful in this book.

00:22.925 --> 00:24.507
I was very reserved about my father.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.949
There was a lot that I left out.

00:27.892 --> 00:33.801
I tried to be fair to him in talking about the things that I loved about him, as well as the things that

00:34.220 --> 00:35.462
with torture that I hated.

00:36.284 --> 00:40.051
I tried to give him a somewhat balanced picture of my mother as well.

00:40.952 --> 00:54.236
But the children's book, the reason this is important is that it is so exciting and freeing to write a book that's free of trauma and where I just get to play with the writing and I'm playing with music again.

00:54.256 --> 00:57.983
It's actually based on Schumann's Thirteen Scenes from Childhood.

00:58.216 --> 01:10.069
And so each, what I'm doing is, there's a piano in the book, and there are two sisters, one's adopted, one's not, and the older one's struggling with the adopted one about to take piano lessons and take over her piano.

01:11.391 --> 01:19.580
But what's happening is she's also learning these scenes from childhood, and the piano teacher has instructed her to make up a narrative, to make up a story.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.802
So this is actually like a young adult book, probably.

01:21.822 --> 01:24.105
No, I'm really aiming for the

01:24.288 --> 01:26.290
nine-year-old, eight-nine-year-old.

01:26.310 --> 01:27.432
A picture book?

01:27.632 --> 01:28.253
It'll have pictures.

01:28.573 --> 01:32.478
So you're probably talking about 2,000, 2,500 words, that's all.

01:32.838 --> 01:34.260
Yeah, very short, very short.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.584
I've counted the words in these books to see how many words there are.

01:37.604 --> 01:39.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39.286 --> 01:40.367
It's going to be short.

01:40.507 --> 01:42.930
2,000 words an hour is basically it.

01:43.010 --> 01:51.460
It has to be so... But the problem, I mean, the good thing is I have an artist, Lucia Lynn, who's the violinist, who's a part of mine, that I've worked with.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.513
excuse me, is also a talented illustrator.

01:55.494 --> 01:56.895
She's the one who's working on the pictures.

01:57.676 --> 02:01.741
And I'm hoping, I had so much fun making the audio tape from Memory Slips.

02:01.881 --> 02:03.422
I don't know if you've seen it or heard it.

02:03.442 --> 02:04.724
In fact, I'll give you one.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.307
I actually would, yeah.

02:07.327 --> 02:14.555
That I would love to deal with an audio book which has the actual playing of the streamlined scenes from childhood in it.

02:14.575 --> 02:15.336
I can take this?

02:15.356 --> 02:16.477
Take it, sure.

02:16.497 --> 02:17.618
Great.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.960
Thank you.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.042
This would be very helpful.

02:23.013 --> 02:24.996
I'm hoping to do also a CD-ROM.

02:25.477 --> 02:27.220
Have you seen Mercer Mayer's Grandma and Me?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.081
No.

02:28.422 --> 02:30.726
It's a wonderful book all by itself.

02:30.906 --> 02:31.587
It's a picture book.

02:31.607 --> 02:41.424
But on CD-ROM, you open the little windows, and then you go into the knothole of the tree, and the owl begins to speak, and he tells you about himself.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.367
Which is what a CD-ROM does that a book can never do.

02:43.938 --> 02:44.680
What do you say?

02:44.700 --> 02:48.007
That's the kind of thing a computer can do that a book can never do.

02:48.047 --> 02:48.488
That's right.

02:48.689 --> 02:49.130
That's right.

02:49.150 --> 02:54.242
I'm writing in my new book about books of the future and all this stuff.

02:54.422 --> 02:54.883
Really?

02:55.204 --> 02:56.226
Really?

02:56.662 --> 03:00.930
And libraries of the future, and I've done a tremendous amount of work on this.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.132
I would love to, too.

03:02.213 --> 03:04.898
I will very much be anxious to read your new book.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.619
It's going to be great.

03:05.699 --> 03:08.865
Which, interesting, because you're also interested in antiquarian books.

03:09.046 --> 03:17.742
Yeah, and this book is not a book about collectors per se, although there will be collectors in there, because I have to keep my core constituency up here.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.120
Let's finish with the kids in the CD-ROM.

03:20.140 --> 03:26.646
So the CD-ROM would incorporate some music education and some music and also different elements of the story.

03:27.026 --> 03:28.287
I'm really excited about this.

03:28.487 --> 03:37.515
But I've also, before Memory Slips, I started a second novel, which I now want to go back to, which the working title is The Snake and the Cactus.

03:37.535 --> 03:46.463
And it's about a Japanese-American violinist who lives in Tokyo, whose mother is a geisha, and whose father was a GI from World War II, and an army chaplain.

03:46.966 --> 03:49.129
a fallen army chaplain.

03:49.149 --> 03:52.834
And at the age of 35, she learns that her father is not dead.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.617
And her son is now college age.

03:55.637 --> 03:59.082
He's going to the States to go to Harvard or MIT, I haven't decided.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.705
And he's a computer techie.

04:01.905 --> 04:06.451
And she decides to go back to the United States and search for her father.

04:07.232 --> 04:11.978
And so she's searching for this lost father who she most of her life thought was dead.

04:12.397 --> 04:17.082
And yet every year they'd do the Oban ceremony, and for some reason they wouldn't leave out food for the father.

04:18.163 --> 04:20.425
So she knew something was not quite right.

04:21.326 --> 04:22.207
Interesting.

04:22.227 --> 04:23.909
So that's the second novel.

04:24.729 --> 04:29.354
And then you affiliated with the writers' group when, about 92 years ago?

04:29.474 --> 04:36.661
No, I've been with the writers' group since, I joined Sally Brady's first writers' group in 89.

04:36.681 --> 04:42.167
And then that group went on Tuesday night, and I think I joined Elizabeth Berg's group.

04:42.805 --> 04:45.849
which is another one of Sally's groups, in 91?

04:49.053 --> 04:51.136
About the same time I joined the writer's room.

04:51.156 --> 04:51.797
Did they help you?

04:52.438 --> 04:53.439
Very much so.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.280
Very much so.

04:54.300 --> 04:59.788
I think, you know, having a weekly audience to kind of write for was a great thing.

04:59.848 --> 05:04.173
I read my stuff to my wife, so she's my... You read it out loud to me?

05:04.514 --> 05:05.455
Oh, it's wonderful.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.299
She's got a good ear.

05:07.379 --> 05:08.180
That's wonderful.

05:08.380 --> 05:09.261
You're very welcome.

05:09.501 --> 05:11.783
I really do write for rhythms and stuff.

05:12.184 --> 05:15.607
It's a nice way to try them out.

05:15.627 --> 05:19.250
My husband is a very good editor also, and so I do try out things.

05:19.270 --> 05:20.831
And I do it with my column.

05:20.851 --> 05:29.119
We don't have to have the first thing, but when you read your own work... When you read your own work, you reflect it the way you think it should go.

05:29.259 --> 05:32.502
And so you're not necessarily getting what the reader's going to get.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.104
So if you allow someone else to read your work to you,

05:35.371 --> 05:41.159
You may find out where the rhythm of the sentence is and where the real meaning is.

05:41.199 --> 05:41.619
Interesting.

05:41.639 --> 05:43.221
Rhythm is so important to me.

05:43.241 --> 05:43.942
Absolutely.

05:44.643 --> 05:47.507
I'm a Shakespeare fanatic.

05:47.667 --> 05:48.188
Oh, really?

05:49.990 --> 05:58.321
You can never replicate a blank verse or anything like that, but really the flow of words and sentences being displayed and going into it.

05:58.381 --> 06:01.125
Using the same word twice drives me crazy.

06:01.308 --> 06:06.355
I try to never use the same word twice in a poem.

06:06.375 --> 06:14.705
If it's a name, obviously, you can't help it, but even in my book, it's just 250,000 words.

06:14.725 --> 06:20.573
If I used the word quintessential once, I would be mortified if I used it a second time.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.756
Things like that.

06:22.876 --> 06:29.745
Well, rhythm is also important to me as a musician, but one of the things I learned from my writer's group is that you fall into your own rhythms.

06:30.316 --> 06:31.697
too, and that can be a trap.

06:32.038 --> 06:42.328
If your sentence sets it up, but it sets the D. And if you end up getting that rhythm too many times, it sort of mesmerizes the reader and maybe bores them a little bit.

06:42.348 --> 06:47.293
So it's kind of good to shake it up a little bit and give them a different look.

06:48.314 --> 06:49.716
We've got plenty of stuff here.

06:49.736 --> 06:50.717
Okay, great.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.779
I wonder if would you kindly inscribe this for me?

06:52.799 --> 06:53.560
I would love to.

06:53.660 --> 06:53.980
Thank you.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.863
This is how my collection started.
