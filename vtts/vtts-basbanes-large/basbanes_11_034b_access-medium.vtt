WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:07.607
Learning doesn't have to be, you know, a non-fun thing, you know.

00:07.627 --> 00:10.350
It can be, you know, a good experience.

00:10.791 --> 00:13.775
Would you call this scholarly pursuit?

00:14.435 --> 00:18.200
In a way, it does end up being that way, you know.

00:18.761 --> 00:21.524
You sort of become like the authority, you know.

00:21.544 --> 00:24.829
People look up to you.

00:24.869 --> 00:29.194
Sometimes it's really bad because if I'm looking for a book,

00:29.512 --> 00:41.025
Already they think that I'm looking for it because there's some hidden name behind it, and it's worth a million dollars or something like that, because I know the internet.

00:41.065 --> 00:42.467
It gets to be ridiculous.

00:42.487 --> 00:43.268
Where do you do your work?

00:43.328 --> 00:44.429
I mean, do you have to travel much?

00:44.650 --> 00:50.036
You mentioned copyright stuff, and I mean, is this stuff you're able to do within a close proximity to it?

00:50.056 --> 00:53.660
Yeah, I can do that, yeah.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.143
But I go to either PPL or...

00:57.338 --> 00:59.421
AAS, of course, for the older stuff.

00:59.441 --> 01:04.507
For the older stuff, yeah.

01:04.547 --> 01:16.020
A lot of, you know, research I've done, you know, at the New England Genealogical Historical Society to, you know, get basic information, you know.

01:16.060 --> 01:20.085
For this guy here, I've been, you know, supplying him with all kinds of material.

01:20.466 --> 01:24.831
I mean, one of the big problems I find about today

01:25.216 --> 01:30.369
is that newspapers really don't carry the information they used to carry years ago.

01:30.389 --> 01:39.512
I mean, newspapers used to have marriage columns, birth columns, death columns.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.309
Intentions to get married.

01:42.329 --> 01:44.371
Court columns.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.433
Very detailed court columns.

01:46.493 --> 01:47.654
Divorces.

01:47.734 --> 01:48.235
Divorces.

01:48.495 --> 01:51.498
And they've done away with all that stuff.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.359
They've done away with all that stuff.

01:53.379 --> 01:56.162
Newspaders used to carry some great literature.

01:56.182 --> 01:56.883
Fiction.

01:57.603 --> 01:59.145
I mean, at one time, you know.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.087
And some of them gets original.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.910
The Boston Globe really started out that way.

02:05.531 --> 02:09.955
Capitalizing on crime and stuff like that.

02:10.340 --> 02:16.388
Tell me a little bit about book scouting.

02:20.393 --> 02:24.038
Well, I did it for, you know, George.

02:24.058 --> 02:30.306
Most of the time, I tried to keep the stuff myself unless I really needed the money, you know.

02:30.326 --> 02:31.207
But where did you look?

02:31.267 --> 02:38.136
Well, at that time, I think the Morgan Memorial in Boston.

02:38.639 --> 02:42.163
had, like, every Monday or so.

02:42.564 --> 02:44.967
One particular day, they would put out all their new books.

02:46.528 --> 02:47.770
You mean newly arrived books?

02:48.010 --> 02:50.894
Right, yeah, newly arrived books.

02:50.914 --> 02:54.498
And, uh, it'd be like a madhouse.

02:54.558 --> 02:57.882
Book scouts and book dealers and everybody.

02:57.982 --> 02:59.204
Everybody was hip to it.

02:59.684 --> 03:04.991
Well, they were all hip to it, but, I mean, everybody had their field, you know, more than one of the gifts.

03:05.011 --> 03:08.595
So, uh, if you, you know, if you had...

03:08.930 --> 03:19.605
had three or more fields, he would come up to you and say, you know, keep your eye out for this for me, keep your eye out for that for me, you know, because he couldn't be in every place at one time.

03:19.966 --> 03:25.734
Were you looking for titles, or just, was it more or less targets of opportunity, as we used to say in the Navy?

03:25.874 --> 03:26.195
Both.

03:28.438 --> 03:28.718
Both.

03:29.359 --> 03:35.528
And then, you know, I would have, I don't know, I just had a sixth sense about, you know, a book being worth money.

03:36.790 --> 03:37.752
How did that work?

03:38.052 --> 03:38.613
I don't know.

03:38.633 --> 03:39.394
By feel, by sense?

03:39.795 --> 03:45.784
I could, like, sniff them out, you know, that it was a limited edition, just by feeling the paper, you know.

03:48.769 --> 03:52.395
But there would be nothing particularly compelling... About the binding, you know.

03:52.415 --> 04:03.152
About the title page or the... Well, sometime, you know, the composition of the title page would certainly indicate that it was...

04:03.689 --> 04:06.634
What would you say one of your greatest finds was?

04:06.694 --> 04:15.929
Can you think of anything offhand?

04:16.069 --> 04:20.175
Any tips for collectors or people who might go out?

04:20.796 --> 04:22.259
What's your best advice for people?

04:22.379 --> 04:24.041
Follow your mind and your heart.

04:24.522 --> 04:26.305
Well, in what respect?

04:27.719 --> 04:29.181
Collect what you like to collect.

04:29.321 --> 04:40.919
But I mean, for finding things that are worthwhile, as opposed to things that are junk, or maybe in your view there is... Well, another man's junk is somebody else's treasure, you know.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.425
You don't know, you know.

04:44.445 --> 04:46.047
I'd say.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.751
Does the Morgan Memorial still have these, uh, sales?

04:49.072 --> 04:52.377
I don't know, but I guess, uh, you know, like, uh,

04:54.247 --> 04:56.889
Salvation Army's bookstores.

04:57.250 --> 05:00.132
I mean, they have, you know, books that they carry.

05:00.152 --> 05:04.836
When I lived in Washington, D.C., they had one of the best second-hand bookstores, the Salvation Army.

05:04.856 --> 05:05.437
Salvation Army?

05:05.457 --> 05:09.260
Yeah, because people were always moving in and out of Washington, and they had good books.

05:09.280 --> 05:09.480
Right.

05:11.142 --> 05:12.323
They may not be valuable.

05:12.343 --> 05:13.404
Well, some of them might be.

05:13.724 --> 05:13.864
Yeah.

05:14.084 --> 05:24.253
You know, the best places I find are, like, these Friends sales, where they get fresh stuff that's coming out of the people that are donating, and they're not being handled by professionals.

05:24.571 --> 05:27.174
Well, don't kid yourself.

05:27.194 --> 05:33.460
I mean, most of these places that have book sales now call in somebody, you know, to look over.

05:34.000 --> 05:44.270
And, you know, like at Brandeis, if the library, you know, needs stuff, I mean, you know, they'll call through the good stuff and find out does the library need this.

05:47.673 --> 05:48.835
So the stuff is looked at.

05:51.157 --> 05:52.418
You want to show me some of your stuff?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.289
Well, we didn't want to start.

05:54.309 --> 05:57.514
I mean, I got a million things that I collected.

05:57.534 --> 05:58.435
I'd love to take a look.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.178
I'd love to get a sense of what you're doing.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.402
I think I'll leave the camera here.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.786
Maybe if we want to shoot, we'll come back and do that.

06:06.809 --> 06:13.140
Hello.

06:14.588 --> 06:18.793
That's a little small collection I read on Sherlock Holmes.

06:19.013 --> 06:26.001
And most of them are really pastiches or parodies of Sherlock Holmes.

06:26.862 --> 06:31.246
I don't think I could afford to buy the first editions of Sherlock Holmes.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.309
But a lot of these are first editions.

06:33.389 --> 06:35.471
Some of them are first paperback editions.

06:38.274 --> 06:42.739
That's one area that I collected.

06:43.816 --> 06:48.323
Just some of my movie books.

06:48.463 --> 06:49.104
Movie books.

06:49.384 --> 06:50.165
These are references?

06:51.167 --> 06:57.155
I don't try to buy a book about some movie has some title.

06:57.175 --> 06:58.617
Have you ever paid a lot of money for a book?

07:00.580 --> 07:02.143
No.

07:02.163 --> 07:06.228
Yeah, one time I collected, you know, limited edition.

07:06.949 --> 07:07.971
Not the limited edition.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.174
Oh, I might want to take a few pictures of this stuff.

07:10.274 --> 07:12.878
I mean, this is... This is...

07:14.326 --> 07:16.289
Yeah, I've got to get some pictures, Victor.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.131
This is too good.

07:18.774 --> 07:19.956
I'm going to go get my camera.

07:21.078 --> 07:22.600
Books are there and there.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.367
They're all over there.

07:26.387 --> 07:27.729
And you know where everything is, right?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.673
Well, I've got a good idea where it is.

07:29.693 --> 07:31.576
You don't catalog it or anything like that?

07:31.837 --> 07:33.359
I just don't have the time.

07:33.379 --> 07:36.104
I mean, research has to go on.

07:36.825 --> 07:39.490
Cataloging is for somebody else.

07:40.482 --> 07:45.348
So how do you feel when you hear about things going off to be pulped?

07:45.589 --> 07:49.053
I bet you think everything should be saved, huh?

07:49.374 --> 07:52.938
Yeah, everything printed really has a value at some point in time.

07:53.980 --> 07:57.805
How do you feel about this trend towards digitization of stuff?

07:57.825 --> 08:02.311
Well, I don't mind making it available, the text and things like that.

08:02.371 --> 08:04.954
But how about libraries that are actually going to go the route of...

08:05.204 --> 08:08.470
using that in place of books and then actually get rid of their books, isn't it?

08:08.650 --> 08:10.814
Well, you'll never get rid of books.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.176
I don't care what you say.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.420
You'll never, never get rid of books.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.227
What makes you so confident on that?

08:18.688 --> 08:20.631
Something about a book that's a book.

08:21.252 --> 08:23.617
And what do you use these happy faces for?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.425
Oh, my wife and I, we belong to this.

08:28.766 --> 08:30.148
She has Huntington's disease.

08:30.517 --> 08:33.341
So, you know, I send out birthday cards to them.

08:33.421 --> 08:38.688
Oh, I thought maybe you'd use them as some kind of a designation for a book or something.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.712
And so these are newspapers and stuff.

08:41.832 --> 08:43.194
Pulp Ear.

08:44.196 --> 08:44.897
New series.

08:44.997 --> 08:45.577
Pulp Ear.

08:45.838 --> 08:46.058
E-A.

08:46.679 --> 08:47.620
Pulp Era is what it is.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.082
I'm looking at it backwards.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.506
Now, there's quite a few.

08:51.626 --> 08:58.515
Either I, you know, have articles or letters, you know, and this thing that I call it.

08:59.963 --> 09:01.767
You know, I've got to tell you, it's very orderly, though.

09:02.168 --> 09:02.489
It is?

09:02.870 --> 09:06.217
It doesn't look too orderly to me.

09:06.337 --> 09:11.168
Do you have a name for this room, or is this just pretty much... My name.

09:12.551 --> 09:15.077
Well, if I have a name, it's not pretty beautiful.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.382
I mean everything.

09:18.610 --> 09:25.098
So you said you've actually paid good money for some, for some... Yeah, I mean, I used to collect this Bernie Bull Press.

09:25.118 --> 09:25.979
Oh, well, that's big.

09:26.080 --> 09:26.861
I met him, you know.

09:27.541 --> 09:27.782
Uh, yeah.

09:27.962 --> 09:28.763
He's a nice guy.

09:28.783 --> 09:38.836
I mean, I sold quite a few of them off, but, uh, I used to collect, I had quite a few of these from him, uh, Henry, uh, what the hell is his name?

09:38.856 --> 09:40.879
Henry, whatever his name is.

09:40.899 --> 09:41.459
Henry Morris?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.782
Yeah, he invited me to write something for him.

09:43.822 --> 09:45.124
I knew this guy's law, sir.

09:46.606 --> 09:51.453
Leonard Schlosser, yeah, his wife is Mary Schlosser, and she's still around.

09:51.993 --> 09:54.878
A peer on paper, two essays on paper history.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.601
Yeah, well, Morris is a genius on paper.

09:57.661 --> 09:58.182
Yeah, right.

09:58.202 --> 10:00.065
He used to make his own paper, he told me.

10:00.365 --> 10:06.594
In fact, he wrote me when my book came out to tell me something about the gold beaters, you know.

10:07.014 --> 10:12.762
Just a few small little things that I kept from the experience of the war.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.805
Some of the books are dedicated to me.

10:14.865 --> 10:15.186
Really?

10:15.366 --> 10:16.107
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:16.323 --> 10:17.064
Like which one?

10:20.707 --> 10:25.312
This one's a great one.

10:25.332 --> 10:31.138
And the title of this book is The Passionate War by Peter Wyden, W-Y-D-E-N.

10:31.158 --> 10:35.642
I guess it's his son that's the Wyden from... Oh, yeah.

10:35.662 --> 10:36.763
All right.

10:36.783 --> 10:45.132
And the subtitle is, To Victor, one of my very favorite people without whom truly this could never have been done.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.313
All the very best.

10:47.187 --> 10:49.650
And salutes.

10:49.670 --> 10:54.235
Peter.

10:55.877 --> 10:56.458
Very good.

11:02.044 --> 11:03.305
Well, this is pretty something.

11:04.046 --> 11:04.607
Argosy.

11:06.549 --> 11:13.017
Stories of Ray Bradbury, Richard Hughes, Michael Foster, Neil Pettison, Lawrence Kirk, Jeffrey Hussle.

11:13.037 --> 11:16.080
Like I said, those are pretty...

11:16.887 --> 11:19.309
Tarzan, The Lost Adventure.

11:19.329 --> 11:21.231
Right.

11:21.251 --> 11:21.812
No.

11:21.872 --> 11:23.233
Pretty recent.

11:23.734 --> 11:24.074
Yeah.

11:24.094 --> 11:27.817
And then we got some from 1910, 1912.

11:28.518 --> 11:29.499
Detective Tales.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.021
And then we got some darn novels here.

11:32.302 --> 11:33.123
Boy's Own.

11:35.044 --> 11:35.845
Those are great, huh?

11:36.206 --> 11:37.687
These, these are great covers.

11:37.707 --> 11:38.888
The Pirate Doctor.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.031
Series of prize novels.

11:42.191 --> 11:43.993
Orphan, what's that, Seamstress?

11:44.013 --> 11:44.373
Yeah.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.135
Orphan Seamstress.

11:46.570 --> 11:50.455
Star of the Fallen, F-A-L-L-E-N.

11:53.840 --> 11:58.045
Matricides, that's apostrophe S, daughter.

11:58.166 --> 11:58.486
Wow.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.450
Now, are these written pseudonymously?

12:01.490 --> 12:04.995
No, these are the real people.

12:06.176 --> 12:07.478
And what's the era of these?

12:07.778 --> 12:11.243
These are probably 1816.

12:11.563 --> 12:12.485
Well, so these are pretty old.

12:12.505 --> 12:13.626
They're in pretty good shape, huh?

12:13.646 --> 12:13.826
Yeah.

12:14.628 --> 12:15.829
So these are Civil War era.

12:16.370 --> 12:16.510
Yep.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.764
This is one of the Spicy Detectives.

12:21.325 --> 12:30.497
Ah, Spicy, S-B-I-C-Y, Detective Stories, Disc, D-I-S-C, by Corey Moran.

12:30.597 --> 12:32.740
Yeah, these are all students.

12:34.723 --> 12:36.185
Spicy Adventure Stories.

12:36.585 --> 12:40.350
Oh, China Charter by Clint Morgan.

12:40.370 --> 12:42.733
So you'd see names like Clint Morgan there.

12:43.085 --> 12:47.630
and the name of, like, Cary, C-A-R-Y, Moran, M-O-R-A-N.

12:48.491 --> 12:50.734
This would pique your interest, right?

12:50.774 --> 12:51.915
Who is this guy, right?

12:51.955 --> 12:54.838
Yeah, but today still nobody knows who they are.

12:54.998 --> 12:55.519
Is that right?

12:55.739 --> 12:58.582
Yep.

12:59.563 --> 13:04.309
I've got a collection here of what they call photo playbooks.

13:05.250 --> 13:11.657
They were, you know, books that movies were adopted from, and they would put scenes...

13:11.958 --> 13:38.218
into the uh into the uh books uh the book could have been published five years before as you know real sir when it became a movie uh cross it and dunlap would republish it with scenes from the movie is this where most of your stuff is in this room no you haven't seen anything yet you're gonna go down the basement okay good

13:38.873 --> 13:40.035
I'm going to get my camera.

13:40.075 --> 13:41.797
I do want to get some pictures of this stuff.

13:41.817 --> 13:43.199
This is pretty good.

13:43.219 --> 13:44.340
Yeah, this is great stuff.

13:49.968 --> 13:51.490
So how long have you lived out in Marlboro?

13:53.533 --> 13:57.418
Uh, since 1979.

13:57.758 --> 14:00.642
And look at this room over here, also packed.

14:00.662 --> 14:01.864
Okay, this room is packed.

14:02.725 --> 14:03.666
Is this the guest room?

14:04.270 --> 14:06.754
Yeah, my sister was here.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.160
I had to clear this old bed off, make it available.

14:10.821 --> 14:11.763
There's a microfilm reader.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.546
Oh, you got a microfilm reader over here?

14:15.029 --> 14:15.149
Yeah.

14:15.630 --> 14:25.367
There's another area that I collect in, and those are novels based on real crimes, real murder, crime, murder, particularly murder.

14:25.847 --> 14:27.190
You really have a sense of that.

14:27.210 --> 14:29.113
You have an appreciation for the...

14:29.819 --> 14:32.523
Bizarre things, don't you, huh?

14:32.583 --> 14:38.871
Murder, science fiction, call it murder, Humphrey Bogart poster on the wall over here.

14:44.078 --> 14:46.281
I'm a member of, you know, God knows, huh?

14:46.301 --> 14:47.382
Just go ahead, you're a member of what?

14:47.783 --> 14:50.526
You know, God knows how many organizations.

14:51.407 --> 14:55.393
The Book Club of California and stuff like that.

14:55.413 --> 14:55.793
New England.

14:56.448 --> 15:04.202
The Armchair Detective, over here.

15:04.543 --> 15:07.127
That's the Armchair, one word, detective.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.251
Mean Streets, this is Australia.

15:09.391 --> 15:12.316
Mean Streets, two words, M-E-A-N, Mean Streets.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.602
Australia's Crime and Mystery Magazine.

15:17.065 --> 15:19.890
Mystery Readers, that's plural, journal.

15:22.958 --> 15:23.899
That's a recent book.

15:24.059 --> 15:24.640
Yeah.

15:24.660 --> 15:25.721
All right, it's first edition.

15:26.021 --> 15:27.022
Now, you buy these new?

15:28.964 --> 15:30.126
No, I don't know.

15:30.146 --> 15:34.410
I seem to have a feel for collecting certain authors.

15:34.770 --> 15:39.615
And suddenly you know that all of a sudden they're... That's a pretty good book, that Alien.

15:39.716 --> 15:40.817
Yeah.

15:40.957 --> 15:43.299
That came out last two years ago, I think it is.

15:44.400 --> 15:50.687
Then I try to buy every mystery book that I can lay my hands on published before 1940.

15:52.270 --> 15:52.891
And how you doing?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.012
How many would you say you have?

15:56.194 --> 15:58.215
Oh, probably about 500.

15:58.496 --> 16:00.918
Let me just go read off a couple of titles, if you don't mind.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.941
You want to take a picture?

16:04.221 --> 16:04.581
Yeah, I do.

16:04.681 --> 16:08.324
The Riddle of the Mysterious Light by H-A-N-S-H-U.

16:08.345 --> 16:08.865
Hanshu.

16:09.586 --> 16:10.166
Hanshu.

16:10.406 --> 16:10.747
Right.

16:11.567 --> 16:17.733
No, I uncovered a bunch of stories that he had written that have never made it into books.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.595
What's his first name, Hanshu?

16:19.975 --> 16:20.716
Thomas.

16:20.736 --> 16:21.096
Thomas.

16:21.363 --> 16:25.507
American, displaced American, moved over to England, died there.

16:27.710 --> 16:43.587
Willing, Killing Jazz by Booth, The Riddle of the Frozen Flame, again by Hanshue, The Case of the Fifth Key by Gregory Dean, The Murder in the P-A-L-L-A-T by J.S.

16:43.607 --> 16:44.007
Fletcher.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.812
So you wonder if you'd find any of these in Harvard University or the BPL, huh?

16:49.573 --> 16:50.314
Harvard, you might.

16:50.334 --> 16:51.235
I think they got them.

16:51.367 --> 16:56.474
There's a lot of reference books in there.

16:56.874 --> 16:58.617
Tons of them.

17:04.084 --> 17:06.607
So do you want to go?

17:06.747 --> 17:09.691
Let me get my camera and I'll shoot a couple pictures up here.

17:11.874 --> 17:16.000
Let's see if I can get my details.

17:16.420 --> 17:19.264
You hate to throw away things?

17:20.155 --> 17:23.580
These are crates of detective mystery novels.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.080
Right.

17:24.100 --> 17:32.652
Mystery, adventure, science fiction, westerns, you name it.

17:33.113 --> 17:34.275
Do you go through them?

17:34.475 --> 17:38.000
When you look at acquisition, what do you do with it?

17:38.440 --> 17:43.467
Well, I just hang on to it until, you know, maybe somebody writes something about it, I have to verify it.

17:44.228 --> 17:44.949
What he's written.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.554
I mean, I'm a great checker-upper, you know.

17:48.574 --> 17:49.015
I just

17:49.568 --> 17:53.394
try to, you know, to check the facts.

17:53.414 --> 17:54.375
I think that's all.

17:54.395 --> 17:59.462
Now, this stuff, do you kind of pick it up at yard sales, anywhere you can find it, right?

17:59.483 --> 18:02.267
Do you buy it formally, like through dealers?

18:02.327 --> 18:13.483
Sometimes dealers, sometimes flea markets.

18:19.471 --> 18:25.258
This is the kind of stuff that they sold back in the 50s.

18:25.278 --> 18:32.426
I mean, they were really nothing, but they gave them, you know, fancy titles.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.608
Now, all right, so what's the worth in this to you?

18:34.628 --> 18:39.213
I don't mean the... I mean the monetary worth?

18:39.233 --> 18:42.777
No, no, the worth, the actual worth, not the monetary worth.

18:44.399 --> 18:45.040
We're looking at...

18:45.323 --> 18:48.906
We had a magazine called Boy Madness, another one called Wayward Nymph.

18:48.926 --> 18:52.730
Now, see, it said that it was really published under the name Beach Party.

18:53.110 --> 18:54.512
Now, who was Ralph Douglas?

18:54.752 --> 18:55.613
D-R-U-G, right.

18:55.773 --> 18:57.374
I have a good idea who it is.

18:57.855 --> 18:58.375
You do?

18:58.455 --> 18:59.877
Yeah.

19:00.137 --> 19:00.697
But you don't know.

19:00.717 --> 19:01.999
You haven't been able to know about that.

19:02.019 --> 19:06.103
Well, I mean, I can find out maybe within a week.

19:07.043 --> 19:08.905
If you cared enough to go find out.

19:09.246 --> 19:09.346
Yeah.

19:09.366 --> 19:15.111
I mean, I happen to know that there was a writer at this time that wrote for this particular company.

19:15.395 --> 19:18.721
whose name was Douglas Duperot.

19:19.343 --> 19:20.264
How do you spell that?

19:20.364 --> 19:24.052
D-U-P-P-E-R, I don't know.

19:24.072 --> 19:24.793
Something like that.

19:26.095 --> 19:32.728
I know he's dead, because I've checked him up in the Social Security death benefit records.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.274
And his name is Ralph Douglas Dupereaux.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.660
He wrote him the name, both Ralph Douglas and Douglas Dupereaux.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.623
Of course, on the cover we say boy madness.

19:42.843 --> 19:48.030
It's an attractive young woman with a skirt up around her thighs and a healthy young man.

19:48.671 --> 19:49.012
Right.

19:49.512 --> 19:50.834
This is what they read in the 50s.

19:50.854 --> 19:55.200
Especially, you know, these traveling salesmen.

19:55.721 --> 19:58.024
Sure.

20:06.070 --> 20:09.014
What are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?

20:09.374 --> 20:13.359
There are probably 100, 150 of these boxes, do you think?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.401
Right.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.602
200 maybe?

20:15.822 --> 20:18.426
They're either filled with pulp magazines or paper bags.

20:18.646 --> 20:20.989
And these are Hollinger, H-O-L-I-N-G-E-R.

20:21.009 --> 20:22.191
These are archival boxes?

20:22.291 --> 20:22.551
Yeah.

20:23.132 --> 20:24.874
Acid-free Hollinger boxes.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.943
And I've got a lot of early...

20:33.425 --> 20:38.652
Well, you know, basically what I'm really interested in is popular literature.

20:41.656 --> 20:42.918
Let's take a picture here.

20:43.980 --> 20:45.241
Popular literature, you said.

20:45.482 --> 20:49.868
Well, you know, and how does it affect mankind?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.374
And you think it does affect mankind?

20:54.835 --> 20:56.637
It does affect mankind.

20:56.737 --> 20:57.418
In what respect?

20:57.438 --> 21:01.744
Well, I mean, people make lots of opinions based on what they read.

21:04.036 --> 21:05.658
good, bad, or indifferent.

21:08.381 --> 21:10.724
So what do you think happens to all this stuff at some point?

21:11.986 --> 21:14.669
At some point, hopefully it ends up in a library.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.172
Hopefully.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.837
You're trying to squeeze through a couple of, an area here.

21:23.360 --> 21:29.628
Have you made any, have you talked to any libraries?

21:29.968 --> 21:33.773
Usually, I don't know, I don't know, you know, just what to do, you know.

21:33.972 --> 21:37.137
This is stuff that was printed around the turn of the century.

21:37.357 --> 21:38.278
And we'll look at the title.

21:38.298 --> 21:45.790
It's called King Dan, Eureka Detective Stories, The Factory Detective by George W. Goode, G-O-O-D-E.

21:45.810 --> 21:46.250
Good.

21:46.270 --> 21:46.511
Good.

21:46.831 --> 21:50.296
Yeah, he was, uh, I think he came from this area.

21:51.498 --> 21:51.658
Uh-huh.

21:51.678 --> 21:55.084
He lived up around Lawrence, somewhere around there.

21:55.104 --> 21:55.244
Uh-huh.

21:56.225 --> 21:57.527
The Old Mill Mystery.

21:58.308 --> 22:00.171
That's probably set up in Lowell, where I'm from.

22:00.191 --> 22:00.772
You never know.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.456
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:07.655 --> 22:12.399
Secret Service series, detective stories by prominent authors.

22:14.881 --> 22:16.903
S-P-E-C-I-E.

22:21.447 --> 22:22.388
Do you read any of these?

22:24.590 --> 22:26.031
Only when I have to.

22:27.152 --> 22:28.533
So it's not because you like this stuff?

22:29.634 --> 22:31.235
Well, there's something about it, you know.

22:31.255 --> 22:36.700
I just, you know, if somebody tells me this is number 37, I gotta check to see if that is a

22:37.051 --> 22:38.954
Number 37.

22:38.974 --> 22:43.640
Somebody said Number 7 was published on June 26th.

22:44.021 --> 22:45.723
I said, no, it's not June 26th.

22:45.743 --> 22:47.005
It's July 14th.

22:47.025 --> 22:52.352
And, you know, I check.

22:52.613 --> 22:55.937
I check everything.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.281
And you'd be surprised how many mistakes I catch.

22:58.481 --> 23:00.884
Oh, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

23:01.485 --> 23:03.989
And these are things that are supposed to be referenced.

23:04.409 --> 23:05.050
Okay.

23:05.553 --> 23:07.415
bibliographies, things like that.

23:07.435 --> 23:09.598
So what kind of a library do you think would benefit from this?

23:14.644 --> 23:18.468
Probably one that's the most interesting in American popular culture.

23:20.551 --> 23:24.696
Is this something you'd want to present or sell or who knows, right?

23:25.737 --> 23:26.197
I don't know.

23:26.218 --> 23:29.181
Maybe one day I'm walking down the street

23:29.482 --> 23:34.428
I drop dead, my kids get all of it, and they say, what are we going to do?

23:34.448 --> 23:35.149
Let's sell it.

23:35.169 --> 23:36.110
Well, why not?

23:36.230 --> 23:37.432
It's an asset.

23:37.452 --> 23:37.652
Right.

23:40.336 --> 23:43.299
I mean, I have paperbacks that are worth over $100.

23:43.319 --> 23:45.462
Wow.

23:45.482 --> 23:46.624
I hope they know that.

23:46.664 --> 23:47.425
The kids know that?

23:47.965 --> 23:51.650
Well, I continue to put away in a box my goodies.

23:54.193 --> 23:55.014
How many kids do you have?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.236
Two boys.

23:56.916 --> 23:57.577
One's married.

23:58.178 --> 23:58.999
They live around here?

23:59.485 --> 24:02.930
Oh, that's nice.

24:02.950 --> 24:04.893
So when did you close the deli, by the way?

24:04.933 --> 24:05.674
I never asked you that.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.455
I never closed it.

24:06.495 --> 24:10.201
I mean, I left it, and my partner stood there for a while.

24:10.481 --> 24:11.623
Eli's, right?

24:12.164 --> 24:16.770
That's what it was, yeah.

24:16.971 --> 24:20.015
More on-chair detective.

24:20.035 --> 24:21.217
Flurry Queen's mystery magazine.

24:21.237 --> 24:24.642
Flurry Queen's mystery magazine.

24:24.662 --> 24:26.144
There's all more letters right there.

24:26.164 --> 24:26.725
Yeah, right.

24:29.270 --> 24:32.513
See, there are thousands, I would say, of items, huh?

24:33.334 --> 24:39.621
Oh, there has to be, I'd say, at least 20,000, 20 to 30,000 items.

24:39.881 --> 24:45.187
You ever rescue anything from the dump?

24:45.207 --> 24:52.535
No, not really.

24:52.555 --> 24:53.496
Very good, Rick.

24:53.676 --> 24:57.100
I want to get a picture of you in the kitchen sitting down, if you don't mind.

24:57.485 --> 25:00.371
That's kind of where you work, I guess.

25:00.451 --> 25:02.054
Yeah, that's where I work.

25:07.064 --> 25:11.152
That's mine, thank you.

25:11.473 --> 25:13.196
What the heck did I do with that notebook?

25:14.899 --> 25:15.240
Thanks.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.983
I'm sorry, one thing leads to another.

25:22.084 --> 25:23.105
You say that's what you find.

25:23.525 --> 25:27.570
Yeah, one piece of information leads to another piece of information.

25:28.130 --> 25:32.455
And then I find that there's something missing somewhere.

25:32.896 --> 25:35.179
You're going to think of nobody else's research.

25:35.199 --> 25:46.772
Right, you know, like back in the good old days, in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, you know, the big thing was more of your animals.

25:46.792 --> 25:46.932
Uh-huh.

25:49.848 --> 25:57.075
I tried researching what melodramas were based on dime novels and stuff like that.

25:57.095 --> 25:59.156
And did you find, did you find them?

26:00.438 --> 26:02.660
They were based on novels.

26:09.886 --> 26:18.454
So Brandeis, you said earlier that it's kind of your way of giving back to the systems.

26:18.653 --> 26:19.174
Right.

26:19.194 --> 26:25.402
I mean, they sort of carried you through, you know.

26:25.422 --> 26:27.846
So they gave me my academic career.
