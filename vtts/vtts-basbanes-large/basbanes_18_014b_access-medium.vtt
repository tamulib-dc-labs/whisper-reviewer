00:01.870 --> 00:08.691
Well, I have such a respect for

00:08.958 --> 00:34.493
the doctor to me the doctor is what you are sir well you notice the jacket picture doesn't have a white coat or a tie or any coat and it doesn't say md on the front of the book i know that i didn't write this book as a doctor i wrote this book as somebody's brother and somebody's father and somebody's son and somebody's friend

00:37.780 --> 00:47.291
close to 40 years of his life in clinical situations, so I know certain things that other fathers and brothers and so forth don't know.

00:47.992 --> 00:52.377
But I didn't write this book as a doctor to lecture people.

00:52.477 --> 00:57.904
I wrote this book because I wanted people to know what I've learned over the years.

00:58.604 --> 01:01.628
And that thing with the jacket picture

01:01.861 --> 01:08.191
my wife said to me, what conceivable reason would you have to wear a coat and a tie?

01:08.211 --> 01:27.480
You want people to see the man who wrote the book, who wrote that book, in a beat-up old sweater, in a shirt without a tie, and every morning you put a damn sweater on and go to work, and that's the guy that free-associated his way through 300 pages of a book, and that's a water beyond the jackpot.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.370
You know, it's interesting.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.574
I have the two books in front of me here.

01:32.716 --> 01:35.962
And, of course, you have that wonderful Thomas Aikens painting.

01:36.423 --> 01:37.525
And I love Aikens.

01:37.545 --> 01:39.168
I love American art, by the way.

01:39.909 --> 01:41.131
Oh, really?

01:41.151 --> 01:43.836
I collect books on 19th century American art.

01:43.876 --> 01:45.058
By the way, we don't want to get into that.

01:45.179 --> 01:50.468
But it is interesting that that first book is the biography of medicine.

01:50.729 --> 01:50.869
Mm-hmm.

01:50.849 --> 01:54.794
biography, a synonym we use for biography is a life.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.256
Exactly.

01:56.276 --> 02:00.261
And these two books, in a way, are bookends.

02:00.942 --> 02:04.526
They are really complementary to one, in a way.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.349
Am I reaching here for something?

02:06.369 --> 02:06.849
Not at all.

02:06.949 --> 02:07.590
No, no, no, no.

02:07.871 --> 02:14.299
You know, because you're a writer, you and I are having a conversation that's different than I've had with anybody else.

02:14.719 --> 02:19.185
There are things that you understand that I think other people are just simply not going to understand.

02:20.347 --> 02:21.890
No, you're dead on the money.

02:22.571 --> 02:26.438
And I didn't perceive it until this instant when you just said it.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.502
Interesting though, isn't it?

02:28.743 --> 02:30.606
It really is, including the picture.

02:30.666 --> 02:43.350
One picture is even taken in my office in medical school, the first one with a white coat.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.276
There's even more to it.

02:45.737 --> 02:47.899
I've got a suntan in that picture.

02:47.919 --> 02:50.062
I have a suntan about once every three years.

02:50.142 --> 02:52.244
I just don't really have one.

02:52.264 --> 02:53.125
It's a great picture.

02:53.285 --> 02:55.227
It's the ideal picture.

02:56.589 --> 03:02.195
You'll notice on the other picture, the way I look usually, which is a little pale.

03:02.235 --> 03:03.336
Well, I like it.

03:03.356 --> 03:04.077
It looks like me.

03:05.699 --> 03:07.701
I'm flattered.

03:07.681 --> 03:11.710
No, but I mean in terms of, I'm not talking about the dust jacket pictures.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.895
I'm talking about the content of the two books.

03:13.996 --> 03:22.856
I mean, and again, when you say that this was a stream of consciousness kind of a work, yeah, okay, but it is part of a larger concern.

03:22.956 --> 03:24.981
And in this first book,

03:24.961 --> 03:31.009
You were talking about the biography, the life of medicine, what has brought us from there to here.

03:31.710 --> 03:35.736
And now we're going to the next step, how we deal with the final, I guess.

03:35.756 --> 03:36.397
Oh, exactly.

03:36.437 --> 03:42.665
But what I'm saying about the dust jacket is it epitomizes the difference in approach in the two books.

03:43.486 --> 03:48.653
And incidentally, you don't call yourself a doctor or MD in the first book either on the dust jacket.

03:48.713 --> 03:49.354
That is true.

03:50.215 --> 03:51.357
That is true.

03:51.995 --> 03:55.339
There's a million things we could talk about, and I know you're a busy man.

03:55.519 --> 04:05.689
And if you'd like, I'd like to send you a copy of this piece directly, as opposed to, you know, you'll certainly get it if you give me your address.

04:05.770 --> 04:11.376
And if you are interested in reading about some of this book stuff, I'd be pleased to send some down.

04:11.676 --> 04:14.519
As one bibliomaniac to another, you bet I'd be interested.

04:14.539 --> 04:17.522
I think you'd like the first chapter, which is my hodgepodge.

04:17.662 --> 04:20.365
I mean, it's, I've tried to...

04:20.345 --> 04:41.323
Pull everything, the literature, the, uh, there has been, there was an essay on, uh, by a, by a psychotherapist on bibliomania where I kind of poo-poo, not poo-poo it a little bit, but, uh, I mean, when you start getting into, uh, um, you know, the, exactly, you know, and, uh,

04:41.303 --> 04:46.794
And he takes on Dr. Rosenbach, and he thought it was very interesting that the man liked to smoke big cigars, you know.

04:46.814 --> 04:52.104
But so did Freud, for that matter, who was quite a collector, by the way, of things, you know.

04:52.244 --> 04:54.629
Well, you know, he should remember Freud's admonition.

04:54.689 --> 04:56.713
Sometimes, boys, a cigar is just a cigar.

04:56.693 --> 04:59.058
He said a cigar was a good cigar.

04:59.138 --> 05:01.182
It probably was.

05:01.202 --> 05:02.444
Well, it killed him, too, didn't it?

05:02.845 --> 05:03.526
Oh, yeah.

05:03.546 --> 05:04.047
Yeah.

05:04.068 --> 05:11.262
Well, Amy Lowell, the one he never mentioned is that Amy Lowell, one of the great women collectors, she smoked.

05:11.282 --> 05:12.504
Now, that was very interesting.

05:12.544 --> 05:14.228
She did smoke cigars.

05:14.248 --> 05:14.989
She smoked cigars.

05:14.969 --> 05:15.730
I didn't know that.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.150
Oh, yeah.

05:16.170 --> 05:17.792
Well, Rosenbach talks about it.

05:17.873 --> 05:24.901
I mean, she would come and visit him in Philadelphia, and they would together smoke cigars, you know.

05:25.101 --> 05:29.627
And I would think that would be a far more tempting target, you know.

05:29.667 --> 05:36.015
Rosenbach had a very close relationship with John Fulton, who was the founder of our own medical library at Yale.

05:36.355 --> 05:36.796
Oh, indeed.

05:36.956 --> 05:41.562
Well, which one is?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.385
There's another base psalm book that you have there.

05:45.074 --> 05:51.501
came kind of not fully as Mrs. Harkness, I guess, paid for most of it, but Rosenbach had to pay for it.

05:51.521 --> 05:52.642
He went over her limit.

05:53.323 --> 05:56.146
He picked up the difference, I guess.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.028
That's an interesting story.

05:59.070 --> 05:59.971
Well, in any case, sir.

06:00.711 --> 06:04.275
Let me give you my address.

06:04.295 --> 06:04.976
Okay.

06:04.996 --> 06:07.319
The post office address is the best because it's faster.

06:07.339 --> 06:07.799
That's fine.

06:07.819 --> 06:08.640
I use that myself.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.001
P.O.

06:09.201 --> 06:13.005
Box 6356

06:13.137 --> 06:16.961
6356 in Hamden, Connecticut.

06:16.981 --> 06:17.562
Uh-huh.

06:17.582 --> 06:18.823
06517.

06:18.943 --> 06:19.344
Okay.

06:19.704 --> 06:25.871
And my phone number is 203-288-9275.

06:26.232 --> 06:28.434
Oh, that's great.

06:28.494 --> 06:31.558
The fax, which is the same, 288-6040.

06:31.958 --> 06:32.358
Okay.

06:33.159 --> 06:33.680
That's great.

06:33.700 --> 06:40.107
Well, I'm now, in addition to writing for the Worcester paper, I am freelancing, and I'm trying to...

06:41.403 --> 06:45.732
with some success, but it's a lot harder than I thought to try and syndicate my column.

06:46.313 --> 06:53.989
And just this week, I've got the Quincy Patriot Ledger has come online, so it's just effectively doubling my circulation in one swoop.

06:54.650 --> 06:55.472
That's terrific.

06:55.552 --> 06:56.995
I'm going to call Glenn.

06:57.176 --> 07:00.222
I'm not going to get back until a week from...

07:00.202 --> 07:07.215
today, but I'm going to call Glenn and tell him that you and I met, even if only through this medium.

07:07.555 --> 07:10.841
I'd give Glenn a call today and see how we're doing.

07:11.342 --> 07:17.333
I guess you learn it's like an old military thing, hurry up and wait.

07:17.313 --> 07:25.926
This editor who, if he is in fact going to buy it, will be a wonderful editor for this book and it's really a wonderful publishing house.

07:25.946 --> 07:34.478
But he did call Glenn about a month ago and said, I love this book and I intend to give you an offer on it.

07:34.458 --> 07:38.845
But, of course, that's a month now, and where's the offer, you know?

07:38.865 --> 07:41.049
Well, trust Glenn.

07:41.389 --> 07:59.959
It turns out, and I have to tell you another part of this story, and I only told this to Glenn last week, that for about six months prior to Glenn's phone call to me, my daughter had been telling, my daughter works in the State Department, and her husband is writing a book on his experience in Nicaragua,

07:59.939 --> 08:02.703
And she kept telling me, I've got to drop my agent.

08:02.743 --> 08:08.532
See, I didn't have an agent when I wrote Doctors, but after Doctors came out, I was sort of hot, so I had my choice of agent.

08:08.552 --> 08:10.535
I picked this big literary agent in New York.

08:10.555 --> 08:12.639
He never really did anything for me.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.465
So my daughter kept saying, you know, I've got this phenomenal agent.

08:16.525 --> 08:20.631
He's young, and he's very aggressive, and you don't want to be...

08:21.505 --> 08:30.022
book writer number 50 on the list of some huge agent, you want to be right at the top of some young, aggressive guy's list.

08:30.583 --> 08:37.557
And she wrote down the name of her husband's agent, and I've stuck it somewhere in our telephone book.

08:38.026 --> 09:04.438
some months after glenn became my agent the thing happened to flutter out of the telephone book and you know what it was that's something i came to him in much the same way uh tom dish recommended he said you've got to get together with glenn hartley yeah because he really cares about uh and he thinks of things and he comes up with ideas and he doesn't drop the book once he gets the contract oh

09:04.418 --> 09:11.117
Let me tell you, I came to him about five years ago, and we've been together this time.

09:11.478 --> 09:14.186
I had this contract for three years with Random House.

09:14.226 --> 09:16.352
Everything was going along swimmingly.

09:17.497 --> 09:20.381
And, you know, he could lose confidence in me.

09:20.441 --> 09:21.683
You know, it would be very easy.

09:21.783 --> 09:25.028
I mean, he hasn't made any money to speak of on me, you know.

09:25.629 --> 09:28.293
And yet they believe in me and they believe in the book.

09:28.353 --> 09:30.195
And boy, what more can you ask for than that?

09:30.356 --> 09:30.916
They'll do it.

09:30.956 --> 09:33.240
You know, they'll do something really good with this book.

09:33.260 --> 09:37.125
You know that big Newsweek article they did about me two weeks ago?

09:37.145 --> 09:38.948
Glenn made that happen.

09:39.046 --> 09:39.767
You're kidding.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.589
Glenn forced that.

09:41.769 --> 09:49.097
You know, Bill Loverd at Knopf was pushing it and pushing it, but it never would have happened if Glenn had not realized.

09:49.117 --> 09:50.539
Number one, Glenn instigated it.

09:50.559 --> 09:51.540
It was his idea.

09:51.580 --> 09:55.985
Number two, he kept pressing them and pressing them and pressing Loverd.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.388
And finally, they did it.

09:58.528 --> 10:00.510
And that has been like a watershed.

10:00.530 --> 10:00.851
Wow.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.893
And I give all the credit to Glenn.

10:03.802 --> 10:07.025
Well, I feel that there are books that are bestsellers.

10:08.006 --> 10:10.348
There are books that really deserve to be bestsellers.

10:10.648 --> 10:13.731
And this is kind of, I think this may even be the lead of my piece.

10:13.791 --> 10:22.999
The response the public is giving to this book, I mean, really, it's really merited here.

10:23.019 --> 10:24.540
It's a marvelous thing.

10:24.640 --> 10:30.385
And I want to let you go because I suspect you've got a full day ahead of you.

10:30.565 --> 10:32.067
It is starting to snow out here.

10:32.107 --> 10:32.707
I don't know if it's hit.

10:32.727 --> 10:33.808
Yeah, I'm going to catch a train.

10:33.788 --> 10:35.231
Actually, I'm on the way to New Haven.

10:35.251 --> 10:37.514
There's a train I'm getting in about 45 minutes.

10:37.695 --> 10:38.837
Well, I better let you run.

10:38.877 --> 10:41.702
Thank you very much.

10:41.822 --> 10:50.036
I'm sure we'll get together again, and I'll send you some things to read, and it's been such a pleasure talking to you.

10:50.497 --> 10:51.098
Oh, for me.

10:51.258 --> 10:52.460
And have a safe trip back.

10:52.661 --> 10:53.362
Thanks again.

10:53.422 --> 10:53.903
Thank you, sir.

10:54.524 --> 10:54.825
Bye-bye.

10:54.945 --> 10:55.105
Bye-bye.
