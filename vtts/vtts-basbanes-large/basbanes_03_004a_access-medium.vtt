WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:03.990
I think anything you say might be very interesting.

00:04.010 --> 00:05.532
Well, I'm going to ask you a question.

00:05.552 --> 00:05.773
Go ahead.

00:05.833 --> 00:17.971
In the beginning, which is, I don't know enough, I know next to nothing, which it pulls me, about the history of American university presses.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.854
How far back do they go?

00:20.415 --> 00:25.262
Well, I can answer that, because I just read, while I was waiting up last year there,

00:25.563 --> 00:27.185
Yeah, that was about the third of the fourth.

00:27.225 --> 00:30.770
The oldest is Johns Hopkins, going back, I think, to 1870, 1880.

00:30.831 --> 00:31.632
Almost to their foundation.

00:32.052 --> 00:33.695
Almost to their foundation.

00:33.735 --> 00:36.459
Well, don't forget, they were founded as a graduate school.

00:36.479 --> 00:36.759
I know.

00:36.879 --> 00:37.760
That's why.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.363
Which would make sense.

00:39.463 --> 00:40.645
Absolutely.

00:40.765 --> 00:41.906
And it would make sense to me.

00:42.407 --> 00:44.350
And founded to publish their dissertations.

00:44.370 --> 00:54.504
And then, of course, I would imagine, similarly, the University of Chicago, which is next in line, also established as a graduate school.

00:54.825 --> 00:54.945
I see.

00:54.925 --> 00:56.187
And that makes sense.

00:56.227 --> 00:57.348
So, I see.

00:57.368 --> 01:07.842
So, what they said to me was a section of OUP in Cambridge, which were 500 years.

01:08.003 --> 01:17.575
A few 20 years ago, there was a 500th anniversary book written of the Cambridge University, if you can possibly believe it.

01:17.595 --> 01:19.498
And Oxford is about as old as you like.

01:20.221 --> 01:29.155
And, of course, they were also appointed to publish the King James Bible.

01:29.836 --> 01:35.184
That established them.

01:35.525 --> 01:36.166
So, I see.

01:36.406 --> 01:37.067
So, I see.

01:37.087 --> 01:38.509
So, it's about fourth after.

01:40.813 --> 01:42.375
Chicago is second.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.080
And then, I believe, Princeton.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.625
Princeton is third because Charles Scribner

01:49.178 --> 01:51.781
gave them some money, and he gave them a press.

01:51.801 --> 01:54.984
And that was about 1905 or 1906, very close.

01:55.004 --> 01:56.005
And then Columbia?

01:56.886 --> 01:58.007
I'm not so sure about Columbia.

01:58.247 --> 02:02.451
Maybe Columbia, but definitely Yale comes along 1908 and Harvard.

02:02.812 --> 02:03.312
Oh, Harvard.

02:03.572 --> 02:04.934
No, Harvard's after Yale.

02:04.954 --> 02:05.855
That's 1913.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.056
Yes.

02:07.076 --> 02:07.756
I was astonished.

02:07.777 --> 02:11.400
I would have thought that we had university presses in the United States for ages.

02:12.081 --> 02:13.082
And then Harvard.

02:14.123 --> 02:17.346
I don't know when it was that Harvard

02:18.727 --> 02:23.677
became the American agent for Heinemann for the Loeb classical library.

02:23.757 --> 02:24.939
Yeah, I think I know that.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.162
I think that was in the 50s.

02:26.182 --> 02:27.524
In the 50s, after what I went to.

02:27.544 --> 02:28.406
Yes, that's right.

02:28.466 --> 02:31.031
Because I have some Loeb libraries which are simply Heinemann.

02:31.131 --> 02:31.432
Right.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.173
And I do, too.

02:32.233 --> 02:34.037
And those are some of my very favorite books.

02:34.057 --> 02:34.598
Oh, I know.

02:34.758 --> 02:35.079
Oldest.

02:35.199 --> 02:37.123
Oh, and the wonderful...

02:37.458 --> 02:38.819
much better binding.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.260
Right.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.743
And it really became a great cash power for Harvard, too.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.124
Oh, I know.

02:43.144 --> 02:44.866
And they charge outrageously for it.

02:45.006 --> 02:46.527
Oh, the ravens try to get them.

02:46.627 --> 02:48.910
I get them whenever I see them on the antiquarian.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.071
You get them on Bookfinder.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.332
Exactly, yeah.

02:51.352 --> 02:54.055
Or if I'm in the Strand Bookstore in New York, sometimes they'll have it.

02:54.075 --> 02:55.677
I'd rather even put them aside for me.

02:55.697 --> 02:55.937
Yeah.

02:56.558 --> 02:58.400
And I would love to have a complete run.

02:58.580 --> 02:58.740
Oh.

02:59.060 --> 03:05.507
I know people come to my house, and I see the green and the red, and they say, gee, how come we've got too a lot of Greek and the green and the Latin and the red?

03:05.825 --> 03:28.554
There are a couple of unique cases in the Love Library where you will have, you'll have the Greek here, and Latin here, because it's scurrilous, homosexual, erotic epigrams from the Greek anthology.

03:28.614 --> 03:29.035
Exactly.

03:29.355 --> 03:31.278
Stratos, Musa Poirelis.

03:31.618 --> 03:32.840
It is.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.802
It is.

03:34.985 --> 03:40.832
As opposed to... And then, in one case, the left-hand page is blank.

03:41.793 --> 03:43.735
Really?

03:43.755 --> 03:43.996
Interesting.

03:44.016 --> 03:44.917
Unique case.

03:44.937 --> 03:46.118
Yeah.

03:46.138 --> 03:50.383
It's because... I'll tell you who it is.

03:50.403 --> 03:52.325
It's Philo.

03:52.345 --> 03:58.933
Some of the volumes of Philo, of Alexandria, some of the biblical commentary.

03:59.150 --> 04:06.599
The left-hand page is blank because the translation was done, and the Greek text is lost.

04:06.699 --> 04:09.843
And the translation was done from Armenian.

04:09.863 --> 04:16.230
If I had known that, that would have been in my last book, because I wrote a little bit about the transmission of texts.

04:16.331 --> 04:26.743
And Ralph Marcus, who did that volume of... That's a great book.

04:27.314 --> 04:29.556
You can get it from the Armenian.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.778
But they don't print the Armenian.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.900
It's a limited use.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.581
That's amazing.

04:34.961 --> 04:41.968
Of course, Armenian was a language that came along much later, too, in the third or fourth century, isn't it, in terms of a written language?

04:41.988 --> 04:44.970
In terms of written language, yes, yes.

04:45.571 --> 04:49.555
Armenia was the first officially Christian nation.

04:49.775 --> 04:53.458
And they actually devised their alphabet to do it.

04:53.478 --> 04:56.241
It's an inter-European language.

05:00.659 --> 05:15.152
Well, Margaret Mead had a sort of nutty notion that everybody on the planet ought to speak one language in common, but that not one.

05:15.393 --> 05:18.916
It ought not to privilege unduly any particular language.

05:18.936 --> 05:20.838
Didn't Shaw try to do the same thing?

05:21.278 --> 05:21.778
Yeah.

05:21.878 --> 05:27.023
And then there was Esperanto, which was one of the stupidest ideas you could imagine.

05:27.103 --> 05:30.126
The whole idea that some...

05:30.578 --> 05:34.164
pop art neo-romance language, which is what it was.

05:37.769 --> 05:56.198
You know, for inflections, inflections and limited word order, except there are those therein versions in Spanish, but it made modern Spanish look like Latin.

05:56.954 --> 05:57.935
So, very simple.

05:58.015 --> 06:03.402
But, of course, it didn't touch on what about all the other languages in the planet.

06:03.442 --> 06:21.703
Margaret Mead, who was much more sophisticated about that, said that she thought, I was surprised at the time because I knew nothing about it, that Malay would be the best, most generally accessible from other languages.

06:21.823 --> 06:25.307
It's because, not only of the phonology,

06:25.473 --> 06:45.356
which is very simple, not a great display of vowels, but that the consonants really don't provide many problems for hexes from all sorts of languages that would have great problems with each other's consonants.

06:45.396 --> 06:52.504
And she said, the trouble, we can't do that because there are almost more speakers of Malay than of any other languages.

06:52.644 --> 06:53.505
And you can't.

06:54.413 --> 06:58.378
You can't displace that by making it general as well.

06:58.899 --> 07:02.424
And she said that she'd figured out that Armenian would be the best bet.

07:02.664 --> 07:08.011
And there were a smaller number of Armenian speakers to be displaced by this than Malay.

07:09.173 --> 07:14.920
And I don't know much, I don't know anything about, you know, a little bit about Armenian or any Armenian.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.565
I do know a little bit about Malay because, um,

07:18.832 --> 07:22.637
It is terribly easy.

07:22.657 --> 07:41.042
It's, you know, minimal inflection and sort of English-Chinese word order, and very limited phonology and a nice, simple way of compounding nouns.

07:41.242 --> 07:47.434
You know, you mentioned that you didn't realize... Oh, you said you know next to nothing about the history of America.

07:47.454 --> 07:48.095
Yeah.

07:48.836 --> 07:55.249
Would it surprise you to learn, or perhaps you know, that Yale University Press operated in the black last year?

07:55.269 --> 08:01.040
That it actually was a profitable entity, which is kind of... That's extraordinary, isn't it?

08:01.060 --> 08:02.322
No, let me kind of...

08:02.808 --> 08:12.080
I'll open the conversation with that, because then I think it would lead to a few other... I was talking about poetry and... Yeah, that's... That's amazing.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.664
I wonder what it was.

08:15.844 --> 08:18.407
Was it GRU Files that made the money?

08:18.528 --> 08:19.849
I think it was that.

08:19.869 --> 08:21.932
I think the China books really helped.

08:21.952 --> 08:22.893
Oh, right.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.237
And the art books have been really... Well, yes.

08:26.257 --> 08:31.684
And that, but for decades, we...

08:32.423 --> 08:37.009
The quality of art books produced by Yale has been splendid.

08:37.029 --> 08:41.434
I think the best in the world, in fact.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.216
And that's a U.K.

08:43.677 --> 08:44.017
operation.

08:44.037 --> 08:44.678
It's a U.K.

08:44.738 --> 08:45.839
operation.

08:45.879 --> 08:49.304
That's the reason now for my going to the U.K.

08:49.324 --> 08:51.546
is to talk about the Yale art books.

08:51.666 --> 08:58.735
On the other hand, off the record,

08:59.204 --> 08:59.985
Off the record.

09:00.045 --> 09:02.108
I beg you to let me use it if it's really good.

09:02.128 --> 09:03.770
No, no, no.

09:04.471 --> 09:09.157
And he's probably teasing by saying off the record, but... I don't care.

09:09.918 --> 09:12.020
I would never use anything.

09:12.781 --> 09:17.988
No, because this isn't personal, so it doesn't have to be off the record.

09:18.168 --> 09:24.216
When Ellen Graham, I suppose I want to talk to you about her, she was a great editor.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.202
when Ellen Graham was doing the literature here.

09:27.963 --> 09:31.667
I wrote books back there, but I just want to write down a few things.

09:32.287 --> 09:51.925
I would occasionally see, and I consulted with her quite a bit over the tenure after I got here in 1977, my second time.

09:53.812 --> 10:01.239
I would notice a new book in literature would come in, and I'd turn pages on it, and I'd say, Ellen, this is appalling.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.521
And she would roll her eyes.

10:03.541 --> 10:08.246
Heavenward, and she said, yes, that was thrust upon us by London.

10:08.266 --> 10:19.176
And it was interesting that the acquisitions of literary, work in literary criticism, scholarship, that came.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.798
Oh, my goodness, that's huge.

10:21.419 --> 10:24.303
That came from London.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.307
Well, that's really... That doesn't have to be off the record.

10:27.367 --> 10:30.812
That's kind of... We're nowhere in the lead of those.

10:31.393 --> 10:35.339
That's... So in those days, London was kind of a poor cousin?

10:35.439 --> 10:37.181
No, it wasn't a poor cousin.

10:37.262 --> 10:47.997
It was just that... Whoever had... Whoever was acquiring some literary works for them wasn't... Getting good ones.

10:48.017 --> 10:48.878
Whereas the art...

10:49.381 --> 10:54.407
and particularly the production.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.272
You said you really want to talk about Ellen Graham.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.755
Let's go to what you think we should talk about.

11:00.775 --> 11:05.420
Let me just, as a little background, because I may refer to it.

11:05.541 --> 11:12.950
I can do it through the history of my relations with Yale Press, so why not?

11:12.970 --> 11:13.530
I'd love that.

11:14.351 --> 11:17.515
In any way you think it makes sense to you.

11:17.832 --> 11:20.294
I may occasionally interject with a question.

11:20.315 --> 11:31.706
Yes, I knew Yale University Press as a graduate student looking at books.

11:32.267 --> 11:46.641
I knew that they published very distinguished dissertations automatically, so there was a series of very, very good dissertations.

11:47.262 --> 12:01.219
identical bindings that went on for, you know, as one of those series, but I knew that lots of university presses, like Michigan, for example, had simply monographs, scholarly monographs series.

12:01.239 --> 12:16.999
But I didn't, but I knew of the Yale Younger Poets series, and I remember the first ones I ever saw when I was an undergraduate was William Merwin.

12:18.430 --> 12:24.857
Richard Howard and I were undergraduates at Columbia together.

12:24.897 --> 12:28.761
The book came into the office.

12:28.801 --> 12:31.024
That's quite a pair of classmates, isn't it?

12:31.044 --> 12:34.968
John Holder and Richard Howard?

12:35.308 --> 12:35.548
Pretty good.

12:37.631 --> 12:41.295
So I knew about it and followed it.

12:41.315 --> 12:43.577
Indeed, when I was in the society, I was

12:44.097 --> 12:50.167
in the Society of Fellows at Harvard at the time, in the mid-50s.

12:50.187 --> 13:02.586
And I did submit a manuscript, and just as I was in my last year in the Society of Fellows, it was picked by Auden.

13:02.606 --> 13:09.497
And so it was actually accepted in spring of 57 and published in 1958, when I was

13:09.950 --> 13:14.035
I'd left Harvard for a brief term while I finished my dissertation.

13:14.075 --> 13:19.702
I was teaching at Connecticut College for women, as it was.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.945
But I was in New London.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.049
This is the blue cheese area of the house.

13:25.069 --> 13:25.229
Right.

13:25.309 --> 13:26.591
I'll try that.

13:27.592 --> 13:34.320
And came down to New Haven.

13:35.009 --> 13:47.984
to meet with the designer, who's somebody I haven't met before, a man named Alvin Eisenman, who has been a friend ever since.

13:48.004 --> 13:51.768
Remarkful, remarkable man.

13:51.788 --> 13:53.931
Now this was for a volume of poetry, right?

13:53.951 --> 13:56.814
This was for the Yale Younger Poet Series.

13:56.834 --> 14:03.582
Which is the most prestigious poetry competition in the North America.

14:04.338 --> 14:16.149
I even remember where his offices were, which was on the building right at the corner of Elm and Temple right down.

14:16.729 --> 14:18.371
Two or three, four buildings down, right?

14:18.391 --> 14:18.912
Just to come down.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.053
I'm sorry, the one right at the corner.

14:23.296 --> 14:32.404
And I remember that very well and working with him.

14:34.814 --> 14:36.537
primarily on matters of design.

14:39.822 --> 14:47.593
And we have, I think, having an unending conversation ever since then.

14:47.613 --> 14:49.676
Isn't that wonderful?

14:49.817 --> 14:55.665
How far into these series of the Yale Younger Poets would you say it was at that point?

14:55.685 --> 14:56.246
It goes way back.

14:56.306 --> 14:58.209
I mean, Hazy wanted back in the whole morning.

14:58.349 --> 14:59.311
Oh, yes.

14:59.491 --> 15:02.335
There is a book, and it'll be in the Yale Press office.

15:03.978 --> 15:04.078
Okay?

15:04.227 --> 15:25.878
by George Bradley, who was a Yale Younger Poets winner, which will give you, at a glance, the history of the Yale Younger Poets series, because what it does is to include some poems from every one of the volumes, with the historical and introductory note.

15:25.998 --> 15:27.660
That's the thing to look at.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.683
Sorry, I should have brought it with me.

15:29.703 --> 15:30.484
That's our job.

15:30.504 --> 15:32.547
But it's right there in the press.

15:33.421 --> 15:56.593
One of my reasons for bringing up the curious coincidence of the press operating in the black is because it does, I think, allow the press also to do

15:57.063 --> 16:03.753
Projects like the Yale Denver Poets, which clearly, in its wildest dreams, could never operate in the black.

16:04.114 --> 16:06.177
No, but I think it was endowed to begin with.

16:06.578 --> 16:07.940
You should check out.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.746
I think it was separately endowed.

16:13.268 --> 16:15.832
But then additional money had to be raised for it.

16:16.373 --> 16:21.180
Because I remember talking to John, I don't know, 20 years ago about ways to get it.

16:21.852 --> 16:26.999
So that's very good, because one wonders if it would survive if it didn't happen at Dallas.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.721
Do you think that they would?

16:28.741 --> 16:29.902
Particularly nowadays, yes.

16:29.942 --> 16:32.526
Well, one wonders.

16:32.546 --> 16:40.256
Also, every university press isn't nailed down.

16:41.257 --> 16:48.186
It has a 10th-rate poetry publication.

16:48.206 --> 16:49.648
It's being, um,

16:49.898 --> 16:54.543
Harvard doesn't, but that's a... Harvard does do it?

16:54.723 --> 16:55.504
No, it doesn't.

16:55.524 --> 16:56.986
I think so, right?

16:57.006 --> 16:59.749
To its credit.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.511
Princeton had a wonderful one.

17:03.033 --> 17:12.103
But when Lippincott came to Princeton Press, all sorts of wonderful things stopped.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.427
One of the first things he said... Oh, all right.

17:15.567 --> 17:16.508
This is the blue cheese.

17:16.528 --> 17:18.150
One of the first things...

17:18.552 --> 17:31.367
What I heard of when he got there was to say, these books are too beautiful.

17:31.908 --> 17:35.072
We've got to save money.

17:35.092 --> 17:46.606
And that is so ignorant about the relation of very good book production to cost.

17:46.626 --> 17:48.508
Because the better the designers are more.

17:49.838 --> 17:50.659
Save your money.

17:50.679 --> 18:05.493
Harry Ford, my great editor at Knopf and before that at Athenaeum, used to be able to find for books of poetry, 2,000 copies.

18:05.513 --> 18:13.420
Used to be able to find lots of, I mean, so many of my books were published, or my earlier books were published at Athenaeum and Knopf were published on laid paper.

18:14.121 --> 18:18.225
Because he knew, he was a great designer as well as an editor.

18:18.391 --> 18:22.315
Have you come across his name before?

18:22.335 --> 18:23.897
No, this is not to do with Yale Press.

18:23.917 --> 18:24.577
And it's important?

18:24.677 --> 18:25.478
Yeah.

18:25.498 --> 18:45.158
No, but these design... And so, and Lippincott junked that, and then he junked that poetry series, which was, although due diligence requires that I admit it, it was one of the series of people I had for picking books for.

18:45.323 --> 18:46.424
Really?

18:46.444 --> 18:48.587
And I was the last one.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.551
I'd done it for quite a few years.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.857
And the series was very good.

18:58.180 --> 19:04.689
And a lot of, you know, very prominent poets were very published in it.

19:04.709 --> 19:07.813
And he jumped out, and that was too bad.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.817
And how would you regard the Yale series?

19:10.837 --> 19:13.761
I mean, it's important, say, in the light of American letters.

19:16.120 --> 19:28.071
Well, when it was almost unique, university presses didn't publish poetry this evening.

19:29.292 --> 19:33.416
It was obviously more important in one sense.

19:33.436 --> 19:46.127
Since then, its importance is simply a function of how good the poets are that are chosen by

19:47.103 --> 19:54.491
who was doing the choosing.

19:54.511 --> 19:59.556
At times, I think the press was ill-advised to get certain people to select, huh?

19:59.576 --> 20:04.381
Well, is that a strength or a weakness, when it's one person who makes the selection?

20:04.401 --> 20:07.525
Right.

20:07.545 --> 20:10.448
It is.

20:10.468 --> 20:10.708
Strength.

20:10.728 --> 20:15.473
Unless a panel is chosen with such knowledge

20:16.685 --> 20:31.659
through sophistication, by someone who really knows enough to be on a friend or him or herself.

20:31.679 --> 20:43.570
Otherwise, we will put together people who aren't playing in the same ballpark, and all they will come

20:45.237 --> 20:47.619
and they will usually compromise.

20:48.500 --> 20:58.350
Which is why the Pulitzer Prizes in poetry have been so abominable for so many decades.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.512
It's because it's being done by committee.

21:00.732 --> 21:03.015
And so you have politics going on.

21:03.035 --> 21:07.339
You have lobbies coming in to present the merits.

21:07.379 --> 21:09.161
This is more of an artistic decision, isn't it?

21:09.221 --> 21:13.405
There was one university press

21:16.456 --> 21:20.660
committee that I served on.

21:20.861 --> 21:23.143
It was absolutely splendid.

21:24.805 --> 21:28.649
But I've not ever served on one nearly as good.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.132
I think it was by chance.

21:33.414 --> 21:45.467
Wesleyan Press, who had been publishing junior, what was I, a publishing junior scholastic or something like that, and made a tremendous amount of money.

21:45.734 --> 21:51.000
And then the new tax laws were passed, and they had to spend it.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.622
Because of non-profit law, I think.

21:53.642 --> 22:04.034
Well, Yale has really launched the careers of some extraordinary... Yeah, but at Wesleyan, this suddenly happened around 1960.

22:04.394 --> 22:06.116
59, 60.

22:08.679 --> 22:15.606
We were in a great panic about what to do, and one of the things they did, I thought they would publish some poetry.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.643
for whose and what.

22:19.663 --> 22:33.098
And they put together a board to choose books for, you know, publishing between two and four a year.

22:38.664 --> 22:38.965
It was amazing.

22:38.985 --> 22:41.948
And by luck, they put together

22:46.400 --> 22:55.833
extremely pleasant and agreeable, and it was a great moment for this to happen.

22:55.853 --> 23:06.869
Because trade publishing of poetry, which was never great, but had really slumped.

23:08.271 --> 23:14.820
And there were some absolutely wonderful poets whose second books couldn't get published,

23:15.458 --> 23:23.513
Maybe because the editor who had originally done them for New York Trade House had the left or something like that.

23:25.597 --> 23:36.377
Probably there were a tremendous number of first-rate books begging to be published.

23:36.397 --> 23:38.040
And what does this mean, books buy?

23:41.969 --> 23:48.457
John Ashbery, James Dickey, James Wright, and who?

23:49.278 --> 23:51.241
A whole raft of people.

23:52.222 --> 24:05.619
And the panel I was on, they thought they would have... I was on it simply because I think I'd been the... No, I'd been the Yale Younger Poet the year before, and Norman Holmes Pearson.

24:05.639 --> 24:08.142
Does his name mean anything to you?

24:08.162 --> 24:08.603
No, but it will.

24:08.663 --> 24:09.664
Check it out.

24:13.373 --> 24:29.513
Norman Holmes Pearson.

24:29.533 --> 24:38.864
He's professor of American literature here.

24:38.884 --> 24:39.845
Very sophisticated when it came to bibliography.

24:39.865 --> 24:40.046
Literary.

24:40.066 --> 24:40.326
Conservation.

24:42.179 --> 24:47.748
executor of several states.

24:47.768 --> 25:04.756
And also very distinguished in World War II as one of Donovan's top second, third in command in OSS.

25:05.056 --> 25:08.642
And from that period when so many

25:09.888 --> 25:13.932
I just wanted to say that was pretty much a Yale project, wasn't it?

25:13.952 --> 25:17.235
A good part of it, yeah.

25:17.255 --> 25:20.378
Robin Winx's book called Cloak and Gown.

25:20.398 --> 25:22.260
You can read about Pearson in that.

25:23.542 --> 25:25.864
It's a fascinating chapter on Pearson.

25:25.884 --> 25:27.586
It's fascinating.

25:29.047 --> 25:37.195
And so they got him, and he got me, and Donald Hall, who's been a friend of mine.

25:39.048 --> 25:45.617
teaching him, Michigan and Richard Wilbur.

25:45.637 --> 25:48.060
And the four of us were the boys.

25:48.080 --> 25:48.160
Wow.

25:48.180 --> 26:06.946
And we knew that there were all these books waiting to be published.

26:06.966 --> 26:07.587
So the Wesleyan one started out

26:08.309 --> 26:09.030
I did.

26:11.473 --> 26:18.601
But then, after four years, we were rotated off, and another board came on, and the books were terrible.

26:20.843 --> 26:24.388
Put it this way, they were second, third, really.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.251
Why did the first ring stay away, or is it they didn't stay away?

26:27.591 --> 26:35.060
Because the people didn't have the, I suppose, the board wasn't as good.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.882
Similarly with the Yale series.

26:38.549 --> 27:03.898
Auden, I admit, also came along at a lucky time.

27:03.918 --> 27:05.960
My generation produced a lot of very good people.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.442
And if you look at the ones that Auden chose, Merwin, Daniel Hoffman,

27:12.147 --> 27:15.250
James Wright, Hedrianne Rich.

27:15.570 --> 27:16.411
He's amazing.

27:16.431 --> 27:17.572
Yeah.

27:17.592 --> 27:38.491
But you see, there were the people there, and it was not all the horrible thing, the horrible institution of creative writing programs and even graduate programs in creative writing had not spread over the whole country.

27:38.511 --> 27:40.973
There are hundreds of

27:41.543 --> 27:49.194
28th-rate writing workshops in poetry all over the country.

27:49.915 --> 27:52.699
And it's unbelievable.

27:54.121 --> 28:01.150
In the days when bad poets had to teach themselves, they were less bad.

28:01.231 --> 28:04.074
Because they weren't taught by a bad poet to begin with.

28:06.137 --> 28:08.381
But that hadn't happened yet.

28:08.401 --> 28:10.183
So there were not many people

28:12.290 --> 28:16.675
And the ones that were around were better.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.236
So, in one sense, it was easier for others.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.541
It would have been afterwards.

28:22.621 --> 28:28.407
He was followed by Dudley Fitz, who chose some very, very good people.

28:28.427 --> 28:36.295
By Stanley Cunitz, who chose some, I think, good, some not so good.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.977
It had its ups and downs.

28:38.648 --> 28:45.594
In recent decades, James Merrill did it for a number of years, and was the best since often, I think.

28:45.614 --> 28:48.256
So it is essentially a poet, a selecting poet?

28:48.276 --> 28:49.617
Mm-hmm.

28:49.637 --> 28:50.178
It's not a critic.

28:50.518 --> 28:50.678
No.

28:50.918 --> 28:56.303
Helen Bedford or River Ricks or somebody of that stature as a poet.

28:56.323 --> 28:56.683
Mm-hmm.

28:56.763 --> 28:58.445
And that's important, I gather.

28:58.845 --> 29:01.087
Well, to them it is.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.709
It's all right.

29:03.789 --> 29:07.913
Except that some poets don't have

29:08.585 --> 29:14.491
Very good judgment.

29:14.511 --> 29:14.731
More.

29:15.752 --> 29:31.908
They may not have totally honorable judgment.

29:32.029 --> 29:34.491
Now is it a requirement that the poet not have been published?

29:34.910 --> 29:35.851
prior to this?

29:35.911 --> 29:37.253
I mean, in a collection?

29:37.454 --> 29:40.177
You mean the poet being selected?

29:40.478 --> 29:42.881
No, no, no, the poet being selected.

29:43.001 --> 29:47.207
There were balloons, I think, for first books.

29:47.227 --> 29:48.168
Say again, I'm sorry?

29:48.188 --> 29:49.490
Yeah, well, for first books.

29:49.510 --> 29:50.391
They have to be the first books.

29:50.411 --> 29:51.493
Oh, yeah.

29:51.513 --> 29:55.258
And when you think of some of the winners, what they became, it's extraordinary.

29:55.278 --> 29:59.023
That's why, if you look at Brad, who is one of them?

29:59.143 --> 30:01.727
I think in recent years, one of the very best.

30:02.517 --> 30:10.225
So when you think about a contribution to the cultural landscape, what is the role of a university press?

30:10.305 --> 30:23.338
That's kind of what I'm... I just love this story of the younger poets, because it is just... They're not necessarily publishing research or scholarship, per se.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.560
You can't even describe it.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.702
It's a creative accomplishment.

30:27.802 --> 30:29.824
But this is a toehold into...

30:33.145 --> 30:44.281
an increasingly interesting problematic question, which is how much of what used to be trade publishing can only be done by non-profits?

30:47.426 --> 30:48.587
Could you address yourself to that?

30:48.627 --> 30:50.410
That's a fascinating concept.

30:50.790 --> 30:53.334
And I would say poetry certainly fits into that category.

30:53.354 --> 30:56.679
But a lot of other things as well.

30:56.699 --> 30:57.700
How about short stories?

30:57.720 --> 31:00.084
What kind of a trade market is there for short stories now?

31:00.164 --> 31:01.566
Very rarely do you see

31:02.558 --> 31:04.861
short fiction by unknown writers.

31:04.881 --> 31:25.149
What you will see is short fiction by very well-established writers, with a publisher like John Updike or whomever, in an effort to placate the author and to please the author, will agree to do a volume of the short fiction, knowing fully that this is not going to sell at all, it's going to be a success, but you do this.

31:26.852 --> 31:30.036
Or even what we call literary fiction today.

31:30.537 --> 31:31.418
But in general,

31:31.853 --> 31:37.722
I mean, I'm very gloomy about the fate of literacy.

31:38.963 --> 31:39.905
I think it's appalling.

31:39.925 --> 31:49.539
I just, I think, I really feel, for the first time, a total dinosaur.

31:51.202 --> 32:00.375
And that all of the expectations I have had about what certain aspects of the world would be like.

32:00.659 --> 32:17.860
despite all my early training from childhood on in knowing that each generation grows up and expects the world to have been like something and only feel very silly because you're so ignorant as to feel betrayed.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.586
So one knows about all that.

32:22.606 --> 32:26.571
Nonetheless, I really feel this is not just what I'm experiencing.

32:26.591 --> 32:29.535
It's not just psychological because I know.

32:30.022 --> 32:35.411
always known too much history to be taken in by a cyclical found.

32:35.831 --> 32:42.201
Are you making this judgment on the basis of what you see throughout the land, particularly in the academy?

32:43.624 --> 32:52.738
Even at Yale, you see this?

32:55.081 --> 33:18.014
as a teaching assistant, was a graduate student teaching class in Indiana University, where I got my Ph.D.

33:18.034 --> 33:18.494
in, in the early 1950s.

33:18.514 --> 33:24.683
I was told that at Indiana then, veteran freshmen were all in the freshman year, but they were tagged

33:26.198 --> 33:38.847
and also an architect, a degree in business, an undergraduate business degree, that is, they do a lot of their work in the business school, in arts and sciences, in education.

33:42.576 --> 33:44.781
The business school then required

33:45.098 --> 33:50.885
three required semesters of freshman composition.

33:50.905 --> 34:00.357
Two semesters and an additional one in which you wrote a 20-odd page research paper and learned one, taking responsibility for what you've written here.

34:02.239 --> 34:04.001
It was a business.

34:04.021 --> 34:05.563
Arts and sciences required two.

34:06.765 --> 34:08.787
School of Education required only one.

34:10.009 --> 34:13.553
And I said, naively, having come from

34:14.512 --> 34:21.465
and also being appalled by what I discovered about the school system in the state of Indiana.

34:21.485 --> 34:30.020
I've gone to New York City Public Schools, which were at that time the finest of the country.

34:31.182 --> 34:37.835
And I said to myself, it's interesting, once and then the results of this have to be exponential.

34:37.855 --> 34:38.055
They work.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.462
along with everything else.

34:42.642 --> 35:09.898
The one thing that is never discussed when we talk about our education problems is the one thing that the education racket in this country, which is the educational industrial complex, as it were, that is the school, the accrediting boards for K-12 in every state,

35:11.077 --> 35:20.534
the teachers unions and the schools of education are all in league to prevent these questions from being raised.

35:22.137 --> 35:24.301
What should the training of teachers be?

35:26.044 --> 35:34.519
And the people who have that blood of this on their hands are people like me and my colleagues.

35:35.562 --> 35:43.169
I'm not allowing myself to get off the hook because I've been screaming about this and this effect ever since I was starting to teach.

35:44.270 --> 35:50.036
First, I talked to you a year ago when I was working on my hook.

35:50.056 --> 35:53.119
I mean, these are exactly the issues that I do.

35:53.179 --> 35:54.080
I hate to be gloomy.

35:54.160 --> 36:01.547
In a period of time, I was at City University in McQueen minor, two students at Yale.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.088
I came to Yale.

36:04.975 --> 36:26.236
The year after my first contact with Yale Press, publishing, my young, young poet's book was there.

36:26.256 --> 36:26.856
I was in here for seven years.

36:26.877 --> 36:29.819
Then I went to City University in New York, which had started its PhD program, and I was there for about 11, 12 years.

36:29.839 --> 36:30.460
Then came back to Yale in 1977.

36:31.300 --> 36:39.772
I taught most of my teaching life at Yale, but it was in two segments.

36:39.792 --> 36:49.486
But when I was teaching there at the University, I would have an MA level course at Hunter College at night.

36:52.791 --> 37:00.362
So I would have people teaching in the New York school system.

37:03.211 --> 37:16.545
substitute teachers waiting to get their licenses and accreditation, and had to take, still taking some additional courses to qualify.

37:16.565 --> 37:31.800
And over a few years, several of them came to me in tears, saying there was something dropping out of, not of my course,

37:33.181 --> 37:41.212
time to qualify because they had been, think I was taking my course, I had to be taking courses in education.

37:43.275 --> 37:46.159
I was taught by low-grade morons and frauds.

37:47.461 --> 37:51.106
And they felt dirty every time they were in that class.

37:51.126 --> 37:57.855
And it was too humiliating when they were going to teach in private school.

37:57.875 --> 38:02.682
My mother, who had been a teacher in high school,

38:04.670 --> 38:12.299
And who had a higher degree from Colombian Comparative Literature.

38:12.559 --> 38:13.140
That's extraordinary.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.682
And she knew from that time.

38:14.902 --> 38:21.009
She knew and the old French and German.

38:21.029 --> 38:22.771
So reading was always a part of your old life?

38:22.912 --> 38:23.252
Oh, yeah.

38:24.774 --> 38:27.437
But she used to tell me

38:28.649 --> 38:50.146
of the ridiculous courses in education she had had to take in order to teach in her school.

38:50.166 --> 38:54.353
And how and why the teachers at the university level would not be allowed to teach in the public schools.

38:57.016 --> 38:59.279
That's why we are the pits.

38:59.339 --> 39:00.580
Why is that?

39:00.760 --> 39:02.002
Because of the racket.

39:03.984 --> 39:17.540
These rotten, corrupt schools of education would be put out of business if, imagine if, in order to teach in high school.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.003
You wouldn't be qualified according to their standards.

39:20.023 --> 39:20.584
Right.

39:20.664 --> 39:26.871
Supposing if, in order to be qualified to teach in high school, I would have whatever academic credentials I have.

39:29.348 --> 39:52.382
It also requires to do an internship for a year.

39:52.402 --> 39:55.487
Working with very experienced teachers.

39:55.507 --> 39:56.188
And to demonstrate some knowledge.

39:56.208 --> 39:56.368
Perhaps.

39:57.175 --> 39:58.537
of the history of education.

39:58.577 --> 40:05.965
They're taught by a professor of history, not by someone in their education school.

40:05.985 --> 40:22.504
Perhaps for, and certainly, although no certification in developmental psychology which might be worthless, some practical knowledge of developmental psychology which might be developed in that internship.

40:22.524 --> 40:22.744
That's all.

40:23.990 --> 40:31.419
There's an on-the-job training for a year to get street smarts and then go in with what you know.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.702
We could do that.

40:34.062 --> 40:35.624
It would be marvelous.

40:35.644 --> 40:50.763
Also, the children of the poor would have access to the same courage of intellectual equality, which is necessary but not sufficient.

40:50.963 --> 40:51.904
We understand that.

40:52.492 --> 40:56.958
But the lack of sufficiency is not supplied by schools of education.

40:56.998 --> 41:03.866
It's by character, good humor, street smart, and devotion.

41:03.966 --> 41:07.451
Otherwise, it's all the knowledge you have.

41:07.471 --> 41:17.183
The more math you know, the more ways you could devise to explain something complex to a student that isn't getting it in.

41:17.838 --> 41:24.046
the one knee-jerk way this is explained.

41:24.406 --> 41:26.229
Can you have a coffee?

41:26.749 --> 41:27.530
Yes, I will.

41:27.550 --> 41:28.091
I'll have a coffee for you.

41:28.111 --> 41:28.211
Sure.

41:28.672 --> 41:34.179
Black coffee for me with caffeine.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.380
Well, you eat a little bit now, OK?

41:35.400 --> 41:38.063
Sorry, but I'm going way off the subject.

41:38.083 --> 41:38.804
That's OK.

41:38.824 --> 41:40.667
It's fascinating.

41:40.687 --> 41:41.368
Could you say regular coffee also?

41:41.388 --> 41:41.928
Regular, please.

41:41.948 --> 41:43.771
Thank you very much.

41:44.331 --> 41:44.892
You're welcome.

41:47.723 --> 42:00.917
So I think there is an absolute decline in literacy and in the ability of people in this country to pay attention to anything for more than a few seconds and witness the triumph of the present administration.

42:00.937 --> 42:01.758
Monument, too.

42:04.962 --> 42:05.462
Ignorance.

42:08.606 --> 42:11.008
Not necessarily stupidity, but ignorance.

42:11.189 --> 42:13.671
But the question is, what does ignorance do?

42:13.691 --> 42:14.312
I love that line.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.233
I'm waiting there.

42:18.065 --> 42:18.786
Uh, two.

42:19.326 --> 42:24.192
Intelligent.

42:24.993 --> 42:26.494
I don't know.

42:26.514 --> 42:36.646
Did you, did you teach, uh, the incumbent while he was at Yale?

42:36.666 --> 42:36.726
No.

42:36.746 --> 42:37.367
I thought it was class minutes.

42:37.387 --> 42:38.588
I don't think I ever thought anymore.

42:38.608 --> 42:39.509
Gattis Smith had it, he told me this morning.

42:40.150 --> 42:40.450
Oh, Gattis?

42:40.470 --> 42:40.570
Yeah.

42:40.590 --> 42:41.271
Gattis taught Cary.

42:41.538 --> 42:44.981
Yeah, but he also taught George Stosey.

42:45.001 --> 42:48.065
And he did not have a high opinion on that.

42:48.105 --> 42:49.866
No, I know he taught W. Amazing.

42:49.906 --> 42:57.494
I don't know how to get into that, but that's a pretty good question.

42:57.634 --> 42:59.776
That was the old Yale.

42:59.956 --> 43:00.637
Say again, I'm sorry?

43:00.657 --> 43:01.678
That was the old Yale.

43:01.858 --> 43:02.479
Yeah, the old Yale.

43:02.499 --> 43:05.061
That was the first product.

43:05.081 --> 43:08.625
And had it not changed to the new Yale, I would not come back.

43:09.787 --> 43:11.870
Well, can I ask this?

43:11.910 --> 43:15.356
Was there an old Yale University Press, or was there a new Yale University Press?

43:15.436 --> 43:17.980
No.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.482
No, not.

43:19.502 --> 43:30.580
I mean, there have been recent changes, but that was not... No, I mean, it was publishing wonderful books.

43:32.129 --> 43:48.393
According to Gavin, though, he said, there's one thing that I should, one aspect I should definitely look into is the publication of a couple of polemics by a fellow named Beard during the 1940s, which were, it sounds very, he was aggressive, anti-Rouisville polemics that were published.

43:48.413 --> 43:49.835
No, those guys didn't know.

43:49.855 --> 43:53.340
And he said, we should really take a look at that.

43:54.301 --> 43:57.245
And then he said, I should also take a look at the Vinland map.

43:57.265 --> 43:59.048
He said, that's kind of a... Oh, yes, that means...

43:59.770 --> 44:00.411
I remember.

44:00.491 --> 44:02.355
They never consulted one scholar.

44:02.375 --> 44:04.979
That's wonderful.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.568
That was the one.

44:09.888 --> 44:11.631
I remember it was published.

44:11.651 --> 44:12.853
Everybody was gung-ho about it.

44:13.314 --> 44:17.201
Yeah, that would be good, thanks.

44:17.802 --> 44:18.824
Come on, in those days.

44:22.992 --> 44:24.394
The Akruscan warrior.

44:24.728 --> 44:27.252
in the Metropolitan Museum that I had grown up with.

44:28.974 --> 44:29.295
That's funny.

44:29.475 --> 44:31.939
Because there was a fake.

44:31.959 --> 44:35.444
I want to take a cookie and pass this over.

44:35.464 --> 44:37.347
Sorry, I'm not giving in for much money.

44:37.527 --> 44:38.969
There you are, actually.

44:39.790 --> 44:46.500
But when I... It's hard for the area of the poets here.

44:49.636 --> 44:59.627
Ellen Graham is a literary editor who I encountered when I came back to Yale in 77.

44:59.647 --> 45:00.948
She was wonderful.

45:01.849 --> 45:08.096
She had great sweet smarts.

45:08.116 --> 45:18.748
She had a very, very good and successful network of referees.

45:20.332 --> 45:20.872
She knew.

45:22.354 --> 45:23.635
She was interested in a book.

45:25.456 --> 45:26.878
As a piece of writing?

45:26.958 --> 45:28.199
Yeah, as a piece of writing.

45:28.239 --> 45:29.760
Which is really unusual.

45:29.940 --> 45:38.648
It's not necessarily part of the discourse, where writing is a bridge that you prized.

45:39.688 --> 45:47.175
It needs to go without saying this.

45:47.195 --> 45:49.697
But she knew.

45:49.812 --> 46:18.807
to whom to send it, someone who would, he hoped, he always had this feeling, he hoped would, excuse me, either see the virtues in achieving, and provide some professional grounding, his enthusiasm.

46:20.069 --> 46:26.999
You'd show up what was wrong with her enthusiasm.

46:27.019 --> 46:30.784
And she was always wonderful enough, smart enough.

46:31.706 --> 46:32.727
To be able to welcome.

46:33.929 --> 46:36.152
The correction, not as a rebuke.

46:36.592 --> 46:40.478
But to be grateful for it.

46:40.498 --> 46:43.983
This she had in common with her office.

46:44.003 --> 46:46.887
Now, did you ever publish fiction?

46:47.677 --> 46:50.481
I don't remember Yale ever publishing.

46:51.022 --> 46:53.545
And do you think it's the purview of a university press to do this?

46:53.565 --> 46:53.926
I don't know.

46:54.707 --> 46:58.752
It is to do poetry because there are so few other elements.

46:58.772 --> 47:00.395
I don't know.

47:00.555 --> 47:01.616
They might.

47:01.837 --> 47:11.150
What I was going to say was when I went off into my minimally relevant polemic state of reading.

47:13.773 --> 47:17.278
There have been excellent models for it.

47:18.845 --> 47:38.693
What used to be high-level trade publishing has now become mid-scale economically trade publishing by university in another press that I've been associated with.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.922
which is Oxford.

47:41.942 --> 47:57.024
When Oxford Fresh New York had in the 1960s, 70s, in New York office.

47:57.044 --> 47:57.565
We still do.

47:57.685 --> 47:59.588
I know, wait, different.

47:59.608 --> 48:02.773
In New York office, and ahead of him, that was

48:04.255 --> 48:19.073
allowed by Clarendon and by Ely House, which was Oxford Press, London, to... They weren't allowed to originate books in English literature.

48:19.093 --> 48:19.834
They were not allowed?

48:19.894 --> 48:20.134
No.

48:20.414 --> 48:21.476
They had to be done in the UK.

48:21.496 --> 48:26.442
That had to be done in the UK, mostly by Clarendon.

48:26.462 --> 48:33.570
But they were allowed to originate books in modern literature, even if they were British.

48:34.782 --> 48:40.351
in modern literature, in American literature, and then, of course, in history and that sort.

48:40.371 --> 48:44.077
So the New York office under a wonderful editor named Barnes, I would say.

48:45.078 --> 48:50.747
It's an excellent history and literature and philosophy editor.

48:50.927 --> 48:53.692
They're publishing wonderful books, and they did very well.

48:53.712 --> 48:55.995
They published lots of Samuel Elliot Morrison.

48:56.055 --> 49:00.402
He's their best-selling author, Samuel Elliot Morrison.

49:01.647 --> 49:08.074
And there was a very, very good text, college text division.

49:08.114 --> 49:13.860
But they published some semi-trade books.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.703
Oh, I think more than semi-trade books.

49:16.723 --> 49:18.786
I think clearly trade books.

49:20.247 --> 49:29.157
And I think university presses can and should publish very good trade books, which aren't being

49:32.073 --> 49:42.709
So often you'll see a book, say, that was published in the UK by Thames and Hudson, which is a trade house, will be published by Yale over here.

49:44.312 --> 49:49.119
They maybe couldn't get a New York publisher to do it.

49:49.199 --> 49:59.835
But let's remember them in the 1950s, through the 1960s, all sorts of books.

50:00.980 --> 50:03.644
that would be published subsequently.

50:04.385 --> 50:06.207
I'm talking about in the field of literature.

50:06.768 --> 50:10.834
It would be published here by university presses.

50:11.194 --> 50:12.637
It would be published only by trade.

50:14.800 --> 50:21.469
And think of the work of some of the greatest literary critics of the 20th century.

50:22.495 --> 50:23.476
William Amberson.

50:24.999 --> 50:25.439
Kenneth Burr.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.823
These are all publishers.

50:28.063 --> 50:29.666
Trade publishers, something small.

50:29.726 --> 50:30.507
New Directions.

50:30.968 --> 50:31.288
Well, yeah.

50:31.308 --> 50:33.371
Shadow and Winders in London.

50:33.391 --> 50:39.721
New Directions might as well have been a, like a cottage thing for Lachlan, James Lachlan.

50:40.041 --> 50:42.065
He published Tennessee Williams, too.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.027
Look, that's another subject.

50:44.048 --> 50:46.551
Jay Lachlan.

50:46.571 --> 50:47.693
Wonderful, wonderful man.

50:49.613 --> 50:56.242
He's not much attached to it, even though all his enthusiasm is like mine, but he helped educate me.

50:57.323 --> 50:59.306
I still wanted to do an interview with him.

50:59.326 --> 51:00.828
He was apparently a very shy man.

51:00.888 --> 51:01.649
Yeah, very shy.

51:01.789 --> 51:03.391
A lovely, lovely person.

51:03.491 --> 51:04.372
And he passed away.

51:04.693 --> 51:07.096
That's one of the failures of my life.

51:07.116 --> 51:11.942
When I was in Huntsville, New Direction was publishing four months.

51:12.597 --> 51:16.502
Well, that was all right.

51:16.523 --> 51:19.126
He was kind of like a Paul Ellen in the publishing world.

51:19.887 --> 51:25.075
But what he did was to get hold of... Yes, we'll find it.

51:25.095 --> 51:27.358
Get hold of... Oh, I know.

51:27.438 --> 51:28.019
Some milk.

51:28.039 --> 51:29.280
Can we have some milk, please?

51:29.721 --> 51:30.422
Ma'am?

51:30.442 --> 51:30.803
Hello?

51:31.123 --> 51:31.423
Ma'am?

51:31.443 --> 51:32.725
Could we have some milk?

51:32.745 --> 51:33.086
Sorry.

51:34.768 --> 51:35.008
Milk.

51:36.350 --> 51:38.233
Please.

51:40.475 --> 51:54.590
He had managed to get hold of all sorts of books that had either gone out of print or that he could buy reprint rights to.

51:56.432 --> 52:08.845
He had already been publishing chapbooks for his own prose, and he had a series called The Makers of Modern Literature, and that published things like

52:09.601 --> 52:10.923
Very, very young.

52:11.003 --> 52:13.588
Harry Levin's brilliant little book on joys.

52:13.989 --> 52:14.870
Which educated him.

52:15.491 --> 52:16.192
I can't think of it.

52:16.212 --> 52:19.398
This is a trade house, which means ostensibly a for-profit house.

52:19.438 --> 52:21.041
Have you ever heard of them new directions?

52:21.161 --> 52:23.165
If they do 20 titles a year, it's a lot.

52:23.185 --> 52:26.310
Well, that's because he fell into it, but at its height.

52:26.628 --> 52:30.854
It was, it was one, I don't remember when I was... But I mean, I think everything was subsidized.

52:30.954 --> 52:33.799
I don't think... Yeah, sure.

52:33.819 --> 52:38.906
There was no expectation that it was... No, no, but look, but look at what trade publishing was.

52:38.986 --> 52:39.747
But that's the point.

52:39.827 --> 52:42.972
What's trade publishing in New York in the 1920s?

52:42.992 --> 52:45.095
Look at the Bollingen series out of Princeton.

52:45.235 --> 52:47.178
That's a different matter.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.041
That's to make those gorgeous...

52:49.021 --> 52:54.747
It had the effect of making those gorgeous, brilliant, and important books for the most part.

52:55.768 --> 52:55.928
Exactly.

52:55.948 --> 52:57.970
Produced gorgeously.

52:58.490 --> 53:01.393
And available for about a quarter of the price.

53:01.413 --> 53:03.915
They should have been about that.

53:03.935 --> 53:12.764
And at the expense of publishing a lot of, I mean, Who Needs It Young?

53:12.784 --> 53:16.868
But along with that, came Courteous.

53:17.405 --> 53:28.674
Those two great masterpiece books, you know, published in beautiful editions by Princeton Press because of the so-called Bollinger series.

53:28.794 --> 53:30.919
Do you know the story of that, the Bollinger series?

53:31.000 --> 53:32.764
It's fascinating.

53:32.744 --> 53:35.007
Again, that was Mellon money.

53:35.067 --> 53:36.990
Paul Mellon.

53:37.611 --> 53:38.973
Paul Mellon money.

53:39.433 --> 53:41.316
They named it for a village.

53:41.797 --> 53:45.662
No, it's a village in Switzerland, but we're called Jung.

53:45.742 --> 53:46.223
We're Jung.

53:46.724 --> 53:47.605
It was a Jungian.

53:47.645 --> 53:49.107
Thank you.

53:49.648 --> 53:50.589
It was a Jungian.

53:50.609 --> 53:54.434
They said they were going to do 100, not 100 volumes, but 100 books.

53:55.936 --> 53:58.540
So there might be 10 volumes in one series.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.025
It was a little... The complete Valérie.

54:02.478 --> 54:04.862
But I'm good.

54:04.882 --> 54:07.246
Have you seen those volumes of Prince and Fresh volumes?

54:07.266 --> 54:08.328
They're magnificent there.

54:08.348 --> 54:10.872
They're really one of the great stories in publishing.

54:10.892 --> 54:14.599
But it was done under the— I have to remember to get this there, because that's funny.

54:14.619 --> 54:17.083
Gorgeous.

54:17.103 --> 54:20.870
With the poetry and the beast, not the best, for instance.

54:20.890 --> 54:26.179
The name of it was Prince Alphonse, otherwise.

54:26.199 --> 54:28.182
You know what, in English, and they would do—

54:28.870 --> 54:34.416
They did that, and of course they had the currency that I thought about.

54:34.536 --> 54:37.679
And things in renters, all of a sudden.

54:37.699 --> 54:38.860
Wonderful, wonderful stuff.

54:38.880 --> 54:41.122
They've had some bestsellers, extraordinary.

54:41.603 --> 54:46.187
Didn't they do all the young books that they published and sold?

54:46.208 --> 54:52.314
There were some that actually sold a hundred, two hundred thousand copies, which is really strong.

54:52.694 --> 54:55.637
I wrote a little bit about it in my last book.

54:55.820 --> 55:05.855
In the 1920s, I want to be a publisher.

55:05.955 --> 55:13.327
I have maybe a little money for my family.

55:13.347 --> 55:14.689
Very little.

55:14.709 --> 55:16.211
And maybe I have a buddy with a little.

55:17.453 --> 55:20.477
Like Bennett Cerf and his pal, for instance.

55:20.497 --> 55:22.420
A perfect example, right?

55:22.460 --> 55:23.161
Pat Covici.

55:23.262 --> 55:23.582
Right.

55:24.001 --> 55:26.244
And it eventually became... Covici-Fried.

55:26.264 --> 55:28.548
Covici-Fried and eventually became Viking.

55:28.568 --> 55:28.968
Exactly.

55:28.988 --> 55:38.302
When, then, Tom Ginsberg's father... He knew his whole... But you could start with... You had a little money.

55:40.345 --> 55:44.331
You were going to buy yourself a publishing business.

55:44.351 --> 55:45.753
Yale Press started that way.

55:45.853 --> 55:47.916
You were going... Hear it out.

55:47.936 --> 55:48.818
You had a little money.

55:51.421 --> 55:53.164
You were going to...

55:54.173 --> 56:01.991
start a publishing firm, you were willing not for the firm to make money, that is, not to make money on your money.

56:02.552 --> 56:08.625
You were willing to just have it work well enough so you could pay yourself a salary.

56:09.267 --> 56:12.013
You could pay yourself a very good salary as head of the firm.

56:12.601 --> 56:16.186
But you wouldn't expect the firm to make a lot of money.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.548
That's at a whole different time.

56:17.568 --> 56:24.858
No, but that's the way publishing... Well, I think Yale... Except for the old publishers rooted in the 19th century.

56:24.958 --> 56:38.417
And the big family... Yes, but I'm thinking of Scribner and Scribner, McMillan, and Lippincott, and all these... The Boston ones, Houghton Lippincott, all these old 19th century firms.

56:38.437 --> 56:41.241
I'm not talking about that, but... For example...

56:41.575 --> 56:54.808
When you look at the history of imprints in literature, R. R. and Reinhardt,

56:55.126 --> 56:56.988
Ferrer Strauss.

56:57.128 --> 56:57.589
Oh, yeah.

56:57.689 --> 56:58.470
Oh, that.

56:58.490 --> 57:00.091
It was Ferrer and Reinhardt.

57:00.111 --> 57:00.572
Ferrer and Reinhardt.

57:00.592 --> 57:02.514
Then it split off into Reinhardt and Company.

57:02.534 --> 57:03.955
It was Holt, Reinhardt, and Winston.

57:04.096 --> 57:04.476
Oh, that.

57:04.576 --> 57:05.117
Oh, yes.

57:05.197 --> 57:06.818
And that became Henry Holt.

57:06.979 --> 57:07.779
Henry Holt.

57:07.799 --> 57:10.723
And the new Winston, published the New Winston Dictionary.

57:11.163 --> 57:13.425
And then, this is later on.

57:13.445 --> 57:17.650
And then Harcourt, Harcourt Brace, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and then went back to Harcourt.

57:17.670 --> 57:18.030
Yes.

57:18.170 --> 57:19.512
And all of that place.

57:19.532 --> 57:19.632
Yeah.

57:19.780 --> 57:28.411
And, oh, and it was Ferrar and Reinhardt, then Reinhardt, and then Ferrar, Strauss, and Young, and then Ferrar, Strauss, and Cuddihy.

57:28.651 --> 57:29.772
Cuddihy.

57:29.812 --> 57:33.897
Cuddihy was a Catholic poet in particular.

57:33.917 --> 57:37.542
Then Bob Giroux came over from Harcourt.

57:38.303 --> 57:40.725
I've had a couple of great interviews with Bob Giroux.

57:40.746 --> 57:41.947
Oh, what a wonderful guy.

57:42.988 --> 57:48.555
When I was an undergraduate at Columbia, and we had—

57:49.008 --> 57:50.389
Did you take Van Doren's first?

57:50.530 --> 57:51.050
Oh, thank you.

57:51.070 --> 57:52.071
Van Doren was mine.

57:53.573 --> 57:54.134
Oh, that's cool.

57:54.294 --> 57:58.799
He was one of my two or three saviors as a geeky undergraduate.

57:59.159 --> 58:00.320
What are the students he had?

58:01.061 --> 58:04.204
He was a wonderful, wonderful teacher.

58:04.305 --> 58:08.369
I had some marvelous teachers, also Lionel Trilling, but I was not a favorite student at first.

58:09.030 --> 58:16.838
And we didn't get along at all, and he mistrusted me as being a sort of creep and unreliable.

58:17.155 --> 58:22.881
I was the kind of undergraduate that I always used to pray when I was teaching.

58:23.141 --> 58:27.306
I used to pray to have patience.

58:27.406 --> 58:29.789
Do you think that you'll teach at some point, Caroline?

58:29.809 --> 58:30.770
Is that in your future?

58:30.790 --> 58:34.834
I'm not sure, actually.

58:34.854 --> 58:38.678
When you're writing a dissertation?

58:39.259 --> 58:40.480
When I'm writing it on?

58:40.780 --> 58:47.179
on Algerian women's writing on the Algerian revolution and some...

58:49.370 --> 58:59.065
And you did some very interesting work at Oxford, I think you mentioned it.

58:59.085 --> 59:03.072
Was that part of this project, the work that you did at Oxford?

59:03.092 --> 59:04.293
Which work are you talking about?

59:04.313 --> 59:06.517
The dissertation that you're talking about now.

59:06.837 --> 59:08.740
Did you do any of that research there?

59:09.001 --> 59:10.583
Yeah, I did a lot of it in France, actually, but also at Oxford.

59:10.603 --> 59:12.066
Do you have any Mulberry?

59:12.086 --> 59:12.687
Do I have?

59:12.707 --> 59:13.588
Mulberry.

59:14.497 --> 59:15.458
I'm not sure.

59:17.742 --> 59:23.290
The Arabic of Westerns.

59:23.611 --> 59:32.845
No, actually, I started learning Arabic a few years ago, but my focus was on Algerian women's writing French.

59:32.925 --> 59:36.370
Oh yes, I assume that.

59:38.290 --> 59:43.197
I meant for the spoken part.

59:43.297 --> 59:53.873
I planned to readdress that, but right now my focus is about French writing.

59:54.093 --> 59:57.578
Did you have any questions that you'd like to ask?

59:57.598 --> 01:00:06.010
I actually started reading.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:07.352
Hold on.

01:00:08.092 --> 01:00:13.647
That's one of two books.
