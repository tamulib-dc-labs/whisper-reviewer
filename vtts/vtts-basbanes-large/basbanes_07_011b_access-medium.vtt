WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:10.303
We have probably the second biggest collection of Thomas Mann manuscripts.

00:10.323 --> 00:10.624
Really?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.668
The big one is at Zurich, of course.

00:12.948 --> 00:15.252
Mann gave these to you?

00:15.673 --> 00:22.705
Mann gave a collection of about, I forget the number, it was around 30.

00:22.725 --> 00:25.009
M-A-N-N, isn't it?

00:25.630 --> 00:45.250
We've got autograph manuscripts to Yale, and then we've added to this, we've got the papers that Helen Lowe Porter has translated, and we have the papers of Agnes Meyer, of Eugene Meyer, and the Washington Post fame, who has wrote many, many letters, large correspondence with Thomas Mann, which is very interesting.

00:45.270 --> 00:50.035
She was his kind of political advisor in this country.

00:50.707 --> 00:52.910
There's a collection that today you might not get.

00:53.271 --> 01:02.023
This kind of reflects back, I mean, if this collection were to be given at this point, it would probably go to Germany because of the changes in politics.

01:02.043 --> 01:02.904
Of course, yeah.

01:03.705 --> 01:16.523
And he was in this country, and he had these papers, and there was a person named Joseph Angel, a graduate student here, who organized this gift and encouraged it.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.324
Joseph Angel?

01:17.704 --> 01:20.528
Joseph W. Angel.

01:21.115 --> 01:29.404
He coordinated the mind gear.

01:29.424 --> 01:32.527
Was he a Yale alumnus?

01:32.547 --> 01:36.011
Oh, he certainly was a graduate school.

01:39.955 --> 01:41.056
He was a student in comparative literature at the time.

01:41.076 --> 01:42.498
All that happened to Nabokov stuff.

01:45.001 --> 01:46.262
Probably Cornell or Harvard.

01:47.086 --> 01:49.269
He would have been in that same kind of category, wouldn't he?

01:49.289 --> 01:51.632
I seem to think Harvard, but I don't know why.

01:52.474 --> 01:52.894
You'd think.

01:53.795 --> 01:54.216
You'd think.

01:54.777 --> 01:57.000
I would have asked why you started.

01:59.123 --> 01:59.504
Uh-uh.

01:59.704 --> 02:06.513
So we have manuscripts of two of the Joseph novels in German, and we have the most famous manuscript.

02:06.573 --> 02:11.220
It's about a hundred pages that Thomas Mann threw out of the Magic Mountains.

02:11.774 --> 02:18.682
And the total manuscript of the Magic Mountain was destroyed during the bombing of Munich at the end of the Second World War.

02:18.702 --> 02:23.948
But he had revised it so much, which is unusual for him, because he was a very clean writer.

02:23.968 --> 02:26.310
He had in his head what he was going to put on the page, you know.

02:26.430 --> 02:30.695
And here are these hundred pages that never made it into the Söderberg.

02:30.815 --> 02:33.358
Do you think that they would get into a critical edition?

02:34.279 --> 02:39.385
There has been a critical edition of these hundred pages, and it was put out by these

02:39.871 --> 02:42.174
Thomas Manchin even in the journal.

02:42.695 --> 02:43.817
Is there a context?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.701
I mean, is it apparent where it belongs, I wonder?

02:47.683 --> 02:49.004
Yeah.

02:49.065 --> 02:50.266
Yeah, you can.

02:50.286 --> 02:54.172
But part of it is the French section.

02:55.314 --> 02:56.075
That's fascinating.

02:56.095 --> 02:56.355
Yeah.

02:56.636 --> 02:57.497
Would you like to see it?

02:57.557 --> 02:59.059
Yeah, I would.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.925
His hand is very, very difficult.

03:03.165 --> 03:03.866
What do we call this?

03:03.886 --> 03:04.768
This is a fragment.

03:05.449 --> 03:09.034
Yeah, rejected pages from him.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.714
Who rejected them?

03:12.734 --> 03:15.879
Yeah, while he was writing the book and revising.

03:15.899 --> 03:21.927
And as I say, it's very unusual, because most of the things you look at... Well, even there are some struck out lines here, too.

03:21.987 --> 03:25.191
So the pages must have become too messy, or he copied them over.

03:27.675 --> 03:34.684
That looks to me like it would be a scholar's... Is that his ex there?

03:35.465 --> 03:36.827
I would assume so, yeah.

03:37.887 --> 03:41.693
Big, bold, cross-out X, right?

03:41.713 --> 03:44.798
Got annoyed, probably.

03:44.818 --> 03:45.099
Yeah.

03:45.179 --> 03:47.883
And he numbered the leg.

03:47.944 --> 03:49.186
That looks like an annotator.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.888
It's certainly a European hand.

03:50.908 --> 03:51.529
I don't know.

03:52.431 --> 03:53.332
Look at that.

03:53.352 --> 03:54.154
It's a European .

03:55.496 --> 03:58.781
Do you have much scholarly interest in looking at this?

03:58.801 --> 04:01.105
You must have people who want it.

04:01.125 --> 04:01.225
Yeah.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.030
Well, this was a long time in the making.

04:06.035 --> 04:08.798
This is called the Yale Zauberbeg, right?

04:08.838 --> 04:10.600
Is that how we pronounce it?

04:10.660 --> 04:11.921
Zauberbeg.

04:11.961 --> 04:12.782
That's not bad.

04:12.802 --> 04:24.073
I'm so interested in the correspondence with Agnes Meyer, which is going to be published soon, with the Fischer-Fell-Lach-and-Charmes.

04:24.333 --> 04:33.583
I remember one day I was here, and I had a visit from Lev Coppola, and he looked at all these things.

04:35.585 --> 04:36.025
Fascinating.

04:38.148 --> 04:46.782
the notes for Thomas Mann's famous essay on Gertrude and Tolstoy.

04:46.802 --> 04:47.643
So, yeah, these are certainly interesting.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.865
Okay, that's good.

04:49.226 --> 04:49.647
That's great.

04:51.510 --> 04:56.458
Is there a chance you can just kind of briefly show me some of the things upstairs without having to describe them?

04:57.179 --> 05:02.147
I know it's outside of your field of... Yeah, I kind of like it, yeah.

05:06.177 --> 05:09.720
That was great.

05:09.760 --> 05:15.265
Thank you.

05:15.805 --> 05:25.674
A collection in a university library, if it's going to really reach its potential, is like a three-legged stool.

05:25.914 --> 05:34.682
You need somebody on the faculty who is informed and interested in this field, so the collection

05:34.831 --> 05:37.213
if it exists, will actually be used.

05:39.295 --> 05:49.105
You need somebody on the library staff who is informed and enthusiastic so the collection will continue to grow.

05:50.046 --> 06:02.678
And then you need either a well-to-do alumnus or friend of the library or an endowed fund

06:03.012 --> 06:16.047
Because it's almost never that the library can afford to subsidize from its operating budget the growth of a special collection.

06:16.848 --> 06:21.574
None of those collections in Feinecke get any money from the university budget.

06:22.235 --> 06:27.501
It's all either endowed funds or

06:28.662 --> 06:35.154
gifts of the library associates, which is the friends of the library group.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.177
That is amazing, isn't it?

06:37.698 --> 06:44.330
I don't know how many people realize that, that it really is.

06:44.350 --> 06:52.324
Well, not all the faculty do, because every once in a while you get sour comments from faculty members about the office.

06:52.557 --> 06:56.282
library wasting all this money on those old books.

06:56.963 --> 07:08.257
Think of the miles of microfilm or now computer disks that we could buy with that money, but they're using only funds that were left for that specific purpose.

07:10.600 --> 07:21.214
So, um, I don't know that I have a copy, but, um,

07:21.633 --> 07:49.294
If you could get a copy, and it was reprinted sometime in the 1920s, and this is when the proposal to Bill Sterling Library, I think, had just been adopted, Chauncey B. Tinker,

07:49.628 --> 07:52.451
who was at that time an English professor.

07:52.471 --> 07:56.496
I was told to ask you about him at some point, but you might have some recollection.

07:56.536 --> 08:17.982
Well, he spoke to the alumni at reunion time that year, and he spoke to them about the needs of a library in a university and the fact that such a library needed support not only from the university budget,

08:18.164 --> 08:21.768
but from alumni and friends and so on.

08:21.788 --> 08:38.264
And essentially, it was that talk that led Lefty Lewis and a couple of other people to form the Library Associates, which is the Friends of the Library group.

08:38.284 --> 08:45.792
And it was a result of that, that the library's

08:46.278 --> 08:50.310
great rare book collections really were formed.

08:50.812 --> 08:54.623
So there really wasn't a collection, a great prior to that?

08:54.984 --> 08:57.030
No, but if you consider

08:57.145 --> 09:13.683
Down at least till probably the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a college library existed mainly for the use of the faculty, not the students.

09:13.703 --> 09:17.988
The students were taught by textbook and lecturers.

09:18.168 --> 09:25.937
And then there were, of course, certain basic books in the college library, but much of what was there was for the faculty.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.812
In terms of research materials?

09:29.172 --> 09:33.417
Yes, and in terms of undergraduate use.

09:33.517 --> 09:55.924
Now, shortly after the turn of the century, it may have been, I don't know enough about the history of education, but then you got to the point where the reserve bookroom entered the picture, and students were assigned readings for a lot of things besides their textbook, and the library had to have multiple copies of those things.

09:56.275 --> 10:05.187
but essentially the real library collections were for the use of faculty and graduate students.

10:05.207 --> 10:07.731
And this was true certainly right through the 30s.

10:09.593 --> 10:23.973
By shortly after World War II, undergraduates were doing library research on a level that would in our day have been considered only appropriate for a Ph.D.

10:23.993 --> 10:24.814
candidate.

10:25.570 --> 10:30.598
Consequently, the libraries had to build their collections.

10:32.441 --> 10:37.008
But if you look at... Can I interrupt?

10:37.048 --> 10:37.388
Yes.

10:37.789 --> 10:45.842
Do you think that all research collections are generally, are really built with the curriculum in mind?

10:46.803 --> 10:47.024
No.

10:47.564 --> 10:47.785
No.

10:48.025 --> 10:51.831
But sometimes the existence of a collection

10:52.317 --> 10:57.506
can add to the curriculum.

10:57.686 --> 11:05.800
No, because essentially the research collections are not built either by the faculty or in most cases by the library staff.

11:05.881 --> 11:16.519
If you look at the great collections in the Beinecke Library, and even many that aren't in the Beinecke Library but are in the main library,

11:16.769 --> 11:37.453
Most of these, I would say, were formed by private collectors, people with means, and devotion, who then, having formed the collection, wanted it to reach its fullest use, and so gave it to a library or sold it to a library.

11:38.374 --> 11:40.817
This is one of the focuses of my book.

11:41.078 --> 11:44.802
My book is really going to focus on the private, on what

11:44.782 --> 11:48.827
But the preservation of knowledge owes to the private collector.

11:48.847 --> 11:53.413
And I just see this everywhere I go, the New York Public Library.

11:53.793 --> 11:55.896
It's just a collection of private book collections.

11:56.217 --> 12:13.118
Yes, and I think this is mainly true everywhere because, and particularly these days, with operating costs what they are, no library could afford to start in and build a collection like any of those that are in the Beinecke County.

12:13.486 --> 12:23.181
And if you look at the Western collection in the Beinecke, this, in some ways, is a very fine example of what happens.

12:23.662 --> 12:34.238
The Western collection, as a separate entity, came into being in the 1940s when William Robertson Cove— How do we spell his name?

12:34.258 --> 12:35.000
C-O-E?

12:35.020 --> 12:35.621
C-O-E.

12:37.564 --> 12:41.029
Gave his Western Americana collection to Yale.

12:41.566 --> 12:46.651
I won't go into the circumstances surrounding it, but... Is it an interesting story?

12:48.592 --> 12:49.713
Yeah, to some extent.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.336
Is it something I could find in...?

12:54.177 --> 13:10.932
There is a whole issue of the Yale Library Gazette in the late 1940s devoted to that collection, and the description was written by Ed Eberstadt, who had been Coe's agent.

13:11.401 --> 13:33.915
Because Coe, in some ways, was the ideal donor, he not only gave this collection, and it was perhaps an unusual collection in that it included not only printed books, but manuscripts and maps and some original paintings, he gave the collection

13:34.182 --> 13:38.308
He paid all the expenses of cataloging it.

13:38.328 --> 13:47.239
He paid for whatever repairs and slip cases and so on were necessary.

13:47.259 --> 13:57.633
And he gave an endowment, a substantial part of which went to establish a chair in the field of American Studies.

13:57.754 --> 14:02.620
And then the remaining income from the endowment went

14:02.988 --> 14:10.340
to pay for a librarian and for additions to the collection.

14:11.622 --> 14:29.232
So that meant that we not only received this great collection, but that since he had insisted that it be separately housed, that gave us a chance to go through the library stacks

14:29.768 --> 14:37.779
and bring out of them everything that was there, that was rare, that needed special care, and that could be added to the collection.

14:37.799 --> 14:43.727
And it's amazing the number and types of things that we found.

14:47.732 --> 14:59.488
For example, well, I mentioned the fact that in the 19th century, the average college professor at Yale had a better library in his own personal house

14:59.755 --> 15:02.699
than the college had in his own field.

15:03.981 --> 15:11.872
And then what happened when the professor died, like Benjamin Silliman, for instance.

15:12.974 --> 15:25.712
I suspect that his widow took one look at the deceased's study and said, good Lord, what am I going to do with this?

15:26.536 --> 15:28.998
send it down to the college library.

15:29.999 --> 15:37.566
And Silliman had not only, of course, all the standard works on geology.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.408
How do we spell his name?

15:39.528 --> 15:41.670
S-I-L-L-I-M-A-N.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.732
Actually, there were two of them, Benjamin Sr.

15:43.752 --> 15:49.217
and Benjamin Jr., and they were the leading American geologists for quite a few years.

15:49.297 --> 15:52.220
These were Yale men, right?

15:52.240 --> 15:52.380
Mm-hmm.

15:53.361 --> 15:56.003
But Silliman

15:56.725 --> 16:14.523
had a tremendous collection of pamphlets, including all kinds of, for instance, prospectuses and reports on gold mines, silver mines, and everything else in the American West.

16:17.406 --> 16:21.190
And that kind of a formal literature, you know, disappears.

16:21.630 --> 16:26.175
And there were a number of other

16:27.202 --> 16:32.127
collections like that that had been formed by faculty members that we drew on.

16:32.207 --> 16:55.993
Then, in the 1880s, a Yale man named Henry Robb Wagner graduated from Yale, and he went to work for the Guggenheims.

16:56.969 --> 17:05.698
who sent him as a mining expert to various parts of the world and everywhere he went, he formed a new book collection.

17:06.979 --> 17:15.148
When it was in the British Isles, he formed a collection of Irish economic tracts.

17:16.930 --> 17:26.740
In Mexico, he not only acquired, well,

17:27.850 --> 17:41.365
For instance, there was a group of about 5,000 Mexican broadsides going all the way from the 17th century to the end of the 19th, and an equal number of pamphlets from the same period.

17:43.147 --> 17:51.617
And he was also interested in early Mexican printing and collected some fine examples of that.

17:52.778 --> 17:56.963
But he got interested in

17:57.601 --> 18:01.687
the early history of the Spanish Southwest.

18:02.187 --> 18:06.133
Now, would you say he was a collector or was he a scholar, a buyer?

18:06.153 --> 18:06.714
He was both.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.376
He was also a bibliographer.

18:09.498 --> 18:20.854
Because, you see, he collected the early history of the Spanish Southwest and formed and compiled a bibliography on his collection.

18:21.595 --> 18:27.523
But he was also typical of many collectors in that, having done this and having done the bibliography,

18:28.010 --> 18:33.958
He then decided it was time to move on to another field, and he disposed of that collection.

18:34.519 --> 18:37.363
That one, I think, is somewhere in California.

18:37.423 --> 18:40.447
I'm not sure where.

18:40.467 --> 18:54.045
But then he moved his attention further north and compiled a collection and did a bibliography on the plains and the Rockies.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.730
The Trans-Mississippi West down to...

18:57.980 --> 18:59.101
the 1860s.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.244
Now, this is still Sullivan we're talking about.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.947
No, no, this is Henry Ralph Wagner.

19:06.971 --> 19:18.324
And his bibliographies are still standard, although The Planes and the Rockies is now, and it's about a fourth edition.

19:19.986 --> 19:26.974
He only edited the first one.

19:28.220 --> 19:31.626
He did a bibliography of early California printing.

19:32.347 --> 19:38.999
He did a very fine work on the cartography of the Northwest Coast.

19:40.703 --> 19:43.788
And he inspired other bibliographers and collectors.

19:45.151 --> 19:52.624
Now, Yale did have his Texas and Middle West collection, which he acquired through a curious

19:52.975 --> 20:01.228
combination of gift and purchase and so on.

20:02.009 --> 20:10.583
But Tom Streeter, whom you've utterly heard of.

20:10.643 --> 20:15.610
I bought Bradley Martin Streeter catalog at the Martin Sale.

20:15.911 --> 20:19.877
I have Bradley Martin Streeter catalog.

20:20.330 --> 20:34.330
Tom, at some point, I think in the 20s, had invested in an oil well in Texas, which produced neither oil nor royalties.

20:35.011 --> 20:37.514
And he went down to Texas to investigate.

20:37.535 --> 20:45.626
And he got very much interested in Texas history.

20:45.646 --> 20:48.430
He was also a...

20:48.764 --> 20:51.648
with Henry Wagner.

20:51.668 --> 21:05.989
And in the course of a conversation, Henry said, you know, he said, my Spanish Southwest bibliography only goes down to 1795.

21:06.149 --> 21:16.864
He said, it would be very interesting to do a bibliography of Texas from 1795 to statehood in 1845.

21:17.772 --> 21:27.469
And Tom thought that would be an interesting project, but his idea of the way to do a bibliography was not necessarily to go around from library to library.

21:27.489 --> 21:29.753
It was to collect all the books to be included.

21:31.456 --> 21:41.653
And he spent from sometime in the 20s to sometime in the 1950s collecting the books.

21:42.393 --> 21:47.339
At the end of that time, he produced a five-volume bibliography of Texas.

21:48.059 --> 21:49.421
Did you know him?

21:49.441 --> 21:50.682
Mm-hmm.

21:50.702 --> 22:06.460
Because, um, it was, uh, he made no secret of the fact that once the bibliography was finished, he would be willing to part with the Texas collaboration.

22:06.676 --> 22:09.520
And what did you think about that?

22:09.901 --> 22:11.683
Well, it wasn't a question of what I thought.

22:13.285 --> 22:26.464
Jim Babb, who was a university librarian in the 40s and 50s and into the early 60s, was a book collector himself.

22:26.844 --> 22:32.011
In fact, he moved from being a stockbroker to being an associate librarian and a librarian of Yale.

22:32.933 --> 22:35.957
And he not only collected books, he collected collectors.

22:36.511 --> 22:46.306
And so he was very much aware of the existence of this collection and the fact that it would be available.

22:46.647 --> 22:49.912
Now when you say available, available to Yale or available?

22:50.092 --> 22:52.255
Available for purchase.

22:52.275 --> 22:53.257
By somebody else.

22:53.277 --> 22:54.699
Not necessarily by Yale.

22:54.799 --> 22:55.079
No.

22:55.881 --> 22:58.765
So there would be a sense of competition involved here.

22:58.925 --> 23:03.953
Yes, except that— Anxiety at least.

23:04.760 --> 23:15.193
He managed to raise enough money among alumni and friends of the library to buy that Texas collection.

23:15.213 --> 23:34.598
Um, and I went, uh, as each section of the bibliography was, uh, was published, then we were allowed to have the materials that were included in that section.

23:34.831 --> 23:39.256
Except I don't think there was too much competition.

23:40.257 --> 23:48.826
Texas would have been a logical other competitor, but apparently there was a feeling there that Street had no right to sell that collection.

23:48.846 --> 23:54.331
He had to give it to them.

23:54.752 --> 23:56.213
I wasn't, of course, at this time.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.658
I was still a very— This was the 1950s.

24:00.778 --> 24:04.602
So this is before Harry Granson got Texas going on a big thing.

24:04.953 --> 24:09.757
Well, and even there, he wasn't particularly interested in historical collections.

24:09.797 --> 24:12.820
He was mainly interested in literary ones.

24:13.060 --> 24:22.768
But at this point, you see, I was a very new, very young curator, and I didn't get involved in any of these high-level things.

24:22.788 --> 24:28.533
But I did get to go down to Morristown each time to pick up the books.

24:29.054 --> 24:34.318
Actually, I had been there once before.

24:34.923 --> 24:40.997
Just on a visit, I was invited to come down and see Tom's collection.

24:43.342 --> 24:50.518
After we took the Texas collection, Ruth Streeter very optimistically said,

24:51.005 --> 24:56.012
once we get the Texas things out of the house, maybe we'll have a little breathing room here.

24:56.974 --> 25:19.527
Of course, what happened was not only the whole Texas collection, since so much of it was broad-sized and pamphlets, left very few empty shelves, and then Tom promptly spent all the money on other books, because he went back to what had always been his

25:20.772 --> 25:25.619
main collecting interest, that Americana beginnings.

25:25.639 --> 25:50.492
But one reason that he was willing to sell to us, and really it was a question of his deciding who he was going to allow to buy this, but because it was Wagner that had started him on this project, and because Wagner's Texas collection was already at Yale,

25:51.164 --> 25:53.928
Then he was much more inclined.

25:53.968 --> 25:58.875
He liked the idea of his collection joining wagons.

25:59.276 --> 26:08.650
And between then what was already at Yale and Strier's collection, we then ended up with

26:09.035 --> 26:15.864
with the greatest pre-state of Texas collection in terms of printed material.

26:15.884 --> 26:19.089
I think even including whatever's in the state of Texas?

26:19.109 --> 26:19.429
Mm-hmm.

26:21.412 --> 26:26.479
Well, if you added everything in Texas together— Part of it in one collection?

26:26.799 --> 26:27.019
No.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.065
At that time, in the 1950s, this was true.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.929
We were the prime collection.

26:34.690 --> 26:37.033
How did it really decide—I mean,

26:37.807 --> 26:42.435
Certainly the street of sale of the 60s is one of the great sales.

26:43.036 --> 26:50.850
How did you decide what should be sold at auction and what should go privately to institutions?

26:51.451 --> 26:53.655
Did you talk about that?

26:53.973 --> 27:00.459
No, he spent—he had always intended that collection to be sold at auction.

27:00.479 --> 27:01.641
The Texas collection?

27:01.801 --> 27:02.281
No, no.

27:02.561 --> 27:06.285
The Texas collection, I mean— No, the Texas collection.

27:06.405 --> 27:13.172
Once he'd finished the bibliography, then he was not interested in that anymore.

27:13.612 --> 27:22.461
Now, it was specified that where he had more than one copy of an item

27:22.711 --> 27:25.154
We could pick whatever copy we wanted.

27:25.314 --> 27:27.136
This is from the regular collection?

27:27.156 --> 27:28.717
Yeah, from the Texas collection.

27:29.618 --> 27:40.369
We could pick whichever copy we wanted, but then he would keep any other copy, so that even after we had bought his Texas collection, he still had copies.

27:40.389 --> 27:48.077
Some of the keys went to him, yeah.

27:48.209 --> 28:11.668
he had always intended that that americana beginnings collection should be sold at options why do you think well i think for two reasons partly because he wanted that sale to be for the 20th century what the brimley sale was for the 19th and in a way you see

28:12.138 --> 28:18.291
It irked him no end that he wouldn't be there at the sale to see what things brought.

28:18.412 --> 28:24.465
On the other hand, if he had parted with that collection while he was still alive, it would have killed him.

28:25.347 --> 28:26.469
Did he ever talk about this?

28:26.870 --> 28:27.351
Oh, yes.

28:28.513 --> 28:31.159
And also, something he didn't talk about,

28:32.118 --> 28:44.010
His family, and this, I think, should not be rooted abroad, his family was never really very sympathetic with his book collecting.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.712
Not many families there.

28:45.732 --> 28:50.236
I mean, Bradley Martin's library was sold within a year of staff.

28:51.798 --> 29:00.927
But when, for instance, he sold the Texas collection for 300-something thousand dollars,

29:01.058 --> 29:08.108
That was proved to his family that he hadn't been an idiot putting his money in these scraps of paper.

29:08.148 --> 29:17.201
And then, of course, the sale of his collection brought in over three million.

29:18.062 --> 29:21.747
Well, of course, there were a number of reasons for that.

29:21.887 --> 29:27.555
The sale came at just the right time in terms of the financial status of the country.

29:27.755 --> 29:35.306
And there was a tremendous amount of goodwill toward him among collectors and in the trade.

29:35.787 --> 29:37.810
Everybody has good things to say about sales.

29:37.850 --> 29:40.374
Everybody wanted that sale to go well.

29:41.856 --> 29:49.628
And also, you know, he built in a certain amount of competition in his wealth.

29:50.080 --> 29:57.427
because in his will, he had a list of libraries.

29:58.629 --> 30:14.645
Actually, there were three lists, and every library on the first list got a bequest of, I've forgotten what it was, five or ten thousand dollars, something like that.

30:15.105 --> 30:20.070
Then, if the sale brought in a certain amount of money,

30:20.607 --> 30:26.395
then there was a second list of about half as many libraries.

30:26.415 --> 30:30.822
And if it brought in so much, then each of them got an additional amount.

30:31.723 --> 30:40.176
And then if it brought in a certain amount more, there was a third list of only about five libraries that got still more.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.665
And he very sweetly said in his will that

30:46.932 --> 31:03.729
that while he did not in any way dictate how his bequests should be spent, he knew that many of these libraries would want to have at least one book from his collection.

31:05.151 --> 31:11.337
And, in fact, most of the libraries on the A and B lists did

31:11.317 --> 31:14.580
spend that money at the sale.

31:14.821 --> 31:18.144
But that really wasn't necessary.

31:18.164 --> 31:20.667
There was a great competition.

31:20.687 --> 31:23.930
But he gave them money to spend his books at the sale.

31:24.130 --> 31:30.517
Well, he gave them money to do whatever they wanted with, but a lot of them spent it at the sale.

31:30.537 --> 31:38.505
But you'd think that maybe he would have said to the American antiquarian society, you know, Clarence Brigham, I think there's something here that you might like.

31:38.722 --> 31:42.627
No, you see, he wanted this sale.

31:42.787 --> 31:44.269
It was his monument.

31:44.369 --> 31:47.333
It was his monument.

31:48.695 --> 31:57.807
He was a really charming person, and certainly one of the most knowledgeable book collectors that I ever met.

31:58.027 --> 32:05.877
He really knew why everything in his collection was important, and he had read them all.

32:06.278 --> 32:08.020
So...

32:08.219 --> 32:23.006
He was, as you know, so many book collectors started collecting somebody else's list, the Zamorano 80, the 100 books important in science, and so on.

32:23.026 --> 32:23.567
But he didn't.

32:23.667 --> 32:27.454
He established his own standards.

32:27.474 --> 32:32.202
Well, to go back to the Western collection, Yale,

32:32.654 --> 32:46.741
At about the same time that we were cataloging the Coke collection, a classmate of Tim Babb's, Winlock Miller Jr., died.

32:47.262 --> 32:52.131
Now, he came from a Seattle family.

32:52.347 --> 33:12.521
His grandfather had been one of the pioneers of the Washington Territory, had been Secretary of State there, had been one of the leading businessmen and so on in the state, and also a political figure.

33:13.723 --> 33:16.768
Bill Winlock collected Pacific Northwest America

33:16.748 --> 33:20.339
but he died untimely just in his early 40s.

33:20.399 --> 33:31.112
And in spite of the fact that his father was a regent of the University of Washington, Winlock had willed it to Yale,

33:31.784 --> 33:41.856
And so we were able to add that collection to the Western collection.

33:41.896 --> 33:45.020
Did it go to Yale?

33:45.060 --> 33:45.601
Winlock, yes.

33:45.621 --> 33:49.486
But I'm sure Washington was pretty upset about that.

33:49.506 --> 33:52.189
Well, yes, except that we...

33:52.523 --> 34:02.637
microfilm for them, all of the manuscripts that had a bearing on Washington Territory history.

34:04.460 --> 34:18.480
So now there are three collections, one from an alumnus, four collections really, two from alumni, one purchase, one gift from a non-alumnus, then

34:19.827 --> 34:36.949
Also, at just about the same time that the Miller Collection came, there was another Yale alumnus, Walter McClintock, and he was about ten years later than Henry Wagner.

34:37.650 --> 34:41.835
But the year he graduated from Yale, he had a job

34:42.119 --> 34:47.744
that summer as photographer to a government commission to the Blackfeet.

34:48.345 --> 34:56.533
And apparently he fell in love with the Blackfeet and took to spending all his summers with them and eventually was adopted into the tribe.

34:57.133 --> 35:09.865
And he was allowed to photograph their Sundance ceremony at a time when it was still a very meaningful part of the religious life of the tribe.

35:10.013 --> 35:22.051
And he had this tremendous collection of photographs of black people, and also all his lecture notes.

35:22.271 --> 35:28.841
And he used to come to Yale, back to Yale periodically.

35:28.861 --> 35:29.963
Actually, he really...

35:30.213 --> 35:38.645
would have preferred to be down at Peabody Museum with the anthropologist, but he was an amateur.

35:38.665 --> 35:40.548
He didn't even have a Ph.D.

35:40.808 --> 35:52.285
But the library took him in, and so when he died, he left his whole collection of photographs and negatives and lecture notes.

35:52.305 --> 35:59.275
He even collaborated on a Blackfoot Indian opera.

35:59.609 --> 36:17.930
And he was a bachelor, and he left a fund subject to a life interest of his two surviving sisters to be used to buy materials relating to North American Indians.

36:18.251 --> 36:21.254
Notice the man's name once again?

36:21.314 --> 36:23.978
Walter McClintock, with a C-K.

36:26.300 --> 36:29.464
C-K-L-I-N-T-O-C-K.

36:29.900 --> 36:36.688
No, M-C-C, C-L-I-N, M-C-C-L-I-N-P-O-C-K.

36:38.290 --> 36:47.181
And then the last of the collections to come to the Western collection was Fritz Beinecke's.

36:47.541 --> 36:49.523
Now he was E.J.

36:49.644 --> 36:50.845
Beinecke's brother.

36:50.993 --> 36:54.439
he started collecting fairly late in life.

36:55.641 --> 37:04.275
And at first, I mean, he was interested in the American West, and at first he was just collecting currently published books and things like that.

37:04.295 --> 37:17.997
But then when he got to a point where he could really afford to collect on a major scale, he did.

37:18.230 --> 37:36.854
He came into the picture just as Cole was leaving, so that the holiday sale in 1954 was the last major sale at which ever—at which Cole bought anything and the first at which Fritz Finnecke bought.

37:37.294 --> 37:41.740
And from then on, he—and he was primarily interested.

37:41.922 --> 37:47.450
in California and the Spanish Southwest, which is where we were weakest.

37:47.791 --> 38:10.225
But he was also interested in essentially anything American Western, and he was the kind of person who was very cooperative and, well, when the Eberstads would get out a catalog, they would send page proofs to me and to Fritz Feinecke.

38:10.373 --> 38:23.202
And I would go over the catalog, and I would write for us a letter, and I would pick out six really great titles.

38:23.603 --> 38:30.437
and say, these we must have, and devote perhaps half a page to each of them.

38:30.457 --> 38:38.033
And then I would pick out another dozen or fifteen and say, these also, and devote a paragraph to each of them.

38:38.594 --> 38:42.422
And then I would find, and then besides there are all these things,

38:42.402 --> 38:47.351
How much time do we have?

38:49.155 --> 38:56.509
Well, we've got at least 20 minutes.

38:56.529 --> 39:02.520
Then he would phone me.

39:02.939 --> 39:09.270
And I know one time he had already talked to Lynn Everstand.

39:09.972 --> 39:18.146
And so he phoned me and said, Trilby, I've just been talking to Sven Gali.

39:18.287 --> 39:20.390
Boy, has he got you hit my diet.

39:20.871 --> 39:22.294
He said, I've gone over your list.

39:22.574 --> 39:23.496
He said, no.

39:23.797 --> 39:30.028
The top six and the next 12, yes, we've got to have those.

39:30.048 --> 39:39.966
And then these and these and these and these, they don't really excite me very much, but if you say Yale needs them all right, then these things,

39:40.267 --> 39:41.589
They leave me cold.

39:41.649 --> 39:43.532
If you want them, you buy them.

39:43.953 --> 39:59.196
And at the height of his collecting, he was giving Yale up to sometimes $200,000 worth of books and manuscripts in a year.

39:59.276 --> 40:01.619
This is Frederick W. Beineken.

40:01.639 --> 40:02.721
This is Frederick W. Beineken.

40:03.041 --> 40:03.422
Yes.

40:03.925 --> 40:09.512
Well, in books and manuscripts.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.717
But again, I wouldn't want that figure publicized.

40:13.177 --> 40:24.953
But essentially... Well, he started collecting in, I would say, the middle 1950s.

40:25.513 --> 40:29.899
And he died soon...

40:29.879 --> 40:32.604
after the first Streeter sales.

40:32.624 --> 40:35.930
The first of the seven Streeter sales was the last there of 67.

40:36.551 --> 40:37.052
Yeah, 67.

40:37.212 --> 40:46.709
And in those 12 years, he put together one of the major Western Americanicals.

40:46.789 --> 40:50.155
What was his motivation?

40:50.175 --> 40:53.862
Well, he loved, he was fascinated by the West,

40:54.179 --> 40:59.428
and he loved book collecting, and he was very devoted to Yale.

41:00.210 --> 41:02.253
Those are the three banks that you need, I think.

41:02.273 --> 41:04.938
Yeah.

41:04.958 --> 41:09.366
And of that— Did you know him?

41:09.606 --> 41:10.207
Oh, yeah.

41:10.247 --> 41:11.530
Tell me a little bit about him.

41:11.870 --> 41:19.123
Well, of the three senior generation Beineckeys, Edwin,

41:19.745 --> 41:21.529
and Frederick and Walter.

41:23.012 --> 41:24.174
Walter I never met.

41:24.194 --> 41:28.683
He died really before I came into the picture.

41:28.743 --> 41:30.807
And he was not a book collector.

41:31.449 --> 41:33.934
Edwin... Are you supportive of what the brothers did, though?

41:34.294 --> 41:39.625
Well, his family did later.

41:40.026 --> 41:41.128
And...

41:41.108 --> 41:42.071
E.J.

41:43.795 --> 41:49.391
started collecting Robert Louis Stevenson and put together the great Stevenson collection.

41:49.471 --> 41:55.287
And then when he was in his 60s, I think, he was quite ill.

41:55.435 --> 42:00.085
And he'd already collected everything that Stevenson you could get.

42:00.526 --> 42:05.096
And he stopped collecting and was kind of grumpy.

42:05.717 --> 42:13.714
Then he had a couple of major operations and came out of them feeling 20 years younger and immediately started a whole new collecting career.

42:13.694 --> 42:23.392
collecting caxtons and incunabula and medieval illuminated manuscripts.

42:23.552 --> 42:29.543
And he was the one that really pushed the family into building the building.

42:29.962 --> 42:36.588
Frederick was his younger brother, and he was Western Americana.

42:36.668 --> 42:40.112
Do you think they saw this as a monument to themselves?

42:40.132 --> 42:47.318
Well, to some extent, and you saw that inscription on the door behind the desk.

42:47.338 --> 42:54.565
But actually, of the three senior brothers, although all three of them matriculated at Yale, F.W.

42:54.585 --> 42:56.627
was the only one that ever graduated.

42:56.776 --> 42:59.080
but they were all very loyal.

42:59.261 --> 43:08.317
And of course, in the next generation, the only one who was a real book collector was Walter Junior, the son of the man who was not a book collector.

43:09.159 --> 43:10.000
And he collected J.M.

43:10.581 --> 43:11.443
Barrie,

43:11.761 --> 43:17.493
And I got to know him when we were both collecting John Buchan.

43:18.334 --> 43:19.276
He's my age.

43:20.859 --> 43:28.154
But the family really were devoted to Yale.

43:28.295 --> 43:31.020
And they were passionate book collectors.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.465
And young Walter said to me one time,

43:33.445 --> 43:41.400
He only worked for Sperry and Hutchinson for a few years.

43:42.402 --> 43:52.782
But Walter said to me one time, if you come to S&H on business, you better have an appointment, and when you get here, you better be first in business.

43:52.862 --> 43:54.525
If you come to talk about books,

43:54.775 --> 43:57.119
You can come any time and stay forever.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.382
And both E.J.

43:59.462 --> 44:00.103
and F.W.

44:00.323 --> 44:04.229
kept large parts of their collections right in their offices.

44:04.890 --> 44:14.545
And in fact, after Fritz Beinecke died, and in his will, all his books came to Yale, to the collection.

44:14.565 --> 44:23.719
But his son, who was then president of the company, also a member of the Yale Corporation, said, I want you to leave

44:23.986 --> 44:27.972
He said, we haven't let anyone else use my father's office yet.

44:28.052 --> 44:32.258
He said, and I want you to leave enough books on the shelf.

44:32.278 --> 44:40.811
He said, they don't have to be the rare books, but I want enough books on the shelf for that office to look the way it did when he was there.

44:43.054 --> 44:45.157
They were a marvelous family.

44:45.177 --> 44:47.741
Every university should have a Bynick family.

44:47.941 --> 44:49.183
Yes.

44:49.501 --> 44:53.887
Unfortunately, you know, all those people are gone now.

44:54.188 --> 45:00.357
But there was a whole series of these people that were inspired.

45:00.978 --> 45:09.390
A lot of them had been Tinker's students when they were undergraduates at Yale, and he was a book collector.

45:09.850 --> 45:14.116
In fact, after he retired, he became the first keeper of rare books at Yale.

45:14.237 --> 45:15.238
I think he did.

45:15.488 --> 45:21.236
And he inspired a tremendous number of book collectors.

45:21.256 --> 45:22.778
Tell me a little bit about Tinker, don't you think?

45:22.798 --> 45:28.106
Well, I didn't really know him because I'm not a... But you say he inspired.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.769
I think that his... He was a book collector.

45:30.789 --> 45:36.377
His legacy, to some extent, might be that the fact that he affected... Yes, absolutely.

45:36.978 --> 45:40.703
Among the people who followed and the things that came from him.

45:40.683 --> 45:46.195
Of course, he collected himself and his folks came to Yale, but essentially, no.

45:46.255 --> 45:59.704
He infected a number of the really important people, like Lesley Lewis, for instance, and Jim Babb,

46:00.190 --> 46:03.655
the Beinecke's, and I don't know how many others.

46:03.675 --> 46:09.383
I see Jackson did some of his, Jackson did some of his, don't you think?

46:09.504 --> 46:19.498
Yes, but, in a way, Bill Jackson was one of the best friends the Yale Libraries ever had.

46:19.478 --> 46:34.340
quite unintentional, because at Yale, and under, and this is a result of the presence there of Donald Wing and Jim Bass.

46:35.501 --> 46:41.570
Well, for instance, when I was appointed librarian of the Koch collection, Jim Bass called me into his office.

46:42.271 --> 46:44.895
He said, all right, I'm giving you the collection.

46:45.331 --> 46:50.460
But how well you do with this will depend entirely on your relations with the booksellers.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.644
Now get the hell out of here and go meet them.

46:54.066 --> 46:55.108
Who said this to you?

46:55.709 --> 46:56.350
Yeah.

46:56.370 --> 46:57.292
Who said this again?

46:57.312 --> 46:59.215
Jim Bass.

46:59.756 --> 47:06.107
And for instance, shortly after...

47:06.965 --> 47:20.664
I was appointed Dick Wormser, who was at that time the kind of dean of the antiquarian booksellers.

47:20.684 --> 47:23.829
He'd been one of the founding members of ABAA.

47:23.849 --> 47:31.019
Dick Wormser invited me to speak to the old book tables in New York.

47:31.039 --> 47:36.567
And I was tremendously impressed meeting all these booksellers.

47:37.002 --> 47:41.870
And when I came back, Jim said, well, did you enjoy it?

47:41.890 --> 47:42.692
And so on.

47:42.712 --> 47:45.957
And I said, yeah, in fact, this was so great.

47:45.977 --> 47:50.044
And why couldn't we invite them here sometime?

47:50.344 --> 47:52.368
And Jim said, why didn't I think of that?

47:52.688 --> 48:01.423
And so he invited the book table up to New Haven and had cocktails for them and a rare book for them and dinner for them here.

48:01.403 --> 48:10.791
And afterwards, Dick Wormser said, you know, he said, over the years, we've had a lot of librarians as our guests.

48:10.812 --> 48:15.836
This is the first time that any library ever invited us.

48:17.217 --> 48:29.048
And the same way, the first time that ILAB met in this country, they met in New York, and Jim invited all of them to New Haven for a day.

48:29.635 --> 48:32.960
And there were special exhibits in Sterling Library.

48:33.020 --> 48:36.044
This was before Beinecke was built.

48:36.204 --> 48:47.841
Tours of the library, lunch at the Lawn Club, cocktails in the medical historical library, and then the Lieberts invited them all to a buffet supper at their house.

48:49.503 --> 48:57.094
And now I think this probably cost the library three or four thousand dollars, which I'm sure...

48:57.192 --> 49:00.298
Jim managed to get from some of the associates.

49:00.799 --> 49:09.497
But what it did in terms of goodwill, you see, and so Yale always cultivated the booksellers.

49:09.697 --> 49:15.809
Bill Jackson alienated his standard reaction.

49:15.889 --> 49:21.861
Whenever an antiquarian bookseller offered Bill Jackson a book, he immediately made a counteroffer of 50%.

49:23.364 --> 49:26.770
You know, you don't get very far that way.

49:26.790 --> 49:30.237
I'm just going to change tapes here.
