00:02.444 --> 00:25.399
This is the serious good period, when you're, if you're me anyway, the time between the time that my book is last touched by you, I'm sorry, and before it comes out into the world and gets, commences its life and dependent on you is the most blissful time in the world.

00:25.519 --> 00:26.320
Yeah.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.587
Because I think for the first one, too, it probably, it's like your first anything maybe.

00:30.607 --> 00:31.208
Mm-hmm.

00:31.228 --> 00:31.388
No?

00:31.722 --> 00:33.765
Oh, no, it's great now.

00:33.785 --> 00:34.766
This time in your life?

00:35.847 --> 00:35.968
Yeah.

00:35.988 --> 00:37.670
No, I mean, this is my first book.

00:37.730 --> 00:38.251
That's what I mean.

00:38.271 --> 00:45.120
What I'm saying, though, is the first book always the best one, or do you find that everyone that comes out is still as ecstatic as the last one?

00:45.140 --> 00:49.265
No, the first time you publish a book, your life feels charmed.

00:50.326 --> 00:51.648
Your life feels charmed.

00:51.668 --> 00:55.453
And there's no... I know.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.118
Don't let anybody talk you out of it.

00:59.198 --> 01:00.700
Don't let anybody say,

01:00.967 --> 01:04.472
You know, you're acting like a kid in a candy store because, hell, it's your life.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.935
You worked eight years on this book, and you were in it.

01:07.756 --> 01:08.477
Enjoy it.

01:08.978 --> 01:13.985
And this is pertinent to you because, and we are talking to Richard Floyd for the sake of the tape.

01:15.887 --> 01:20.834
I could never have done this without the total support of my wife.

01:21.094 --> 01:23.497
And it's really her idea.

01:23.698 --> 01:27.683
This book, I was writing a piece nine years ago for Boston Magazine.

01:28.658 --> 01:30.020
And I always read stuff to her.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.722
Everything I write, I read to her.

01:31.762 --> 01:33.444
Yeah, what you do, I understand.

01:33.484 --> 01:34.305
You read to your wife.

01:35.025 --> 01:35.486
I used to.

01:35.967 --> 01:36.767
You don't anymore.

01:36.787 --> 01:37.969
She's got into politics.

01:37.989 --> 01:39.090
She doesn't have time.

01:39.671 --> 01:41.373
I've spent a lot of time listening to her.

01:43.315 --> 01:45.458
And she said, I was reading this thing.

01:46.419 --> 01:47.200
It doesn't matter what it is.

01:47.260 --> 01:49.062
And she said, you know, that's your book.

01:49.082 --> 01:49.602
That's your book.

01:50.724 --> 01:52.366
And it became the book.

01:52.386 --> 01:52.946
And to lead.

01:53.207 --> 01:57.872
And to support me when I said I've got to quit the newspaper job because I can't do these two things at the same time.

01:58.898 --> 02:00.960
You can only give your best shot to one thing.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.221
I don't know if you find that.

02:02.481 --> 02:03.442
I do find that.

02:03.682 --> 02:06.725
Maybe you find that in teaching, because I don't think you're teaching anymore.

02:06.805 --> 02:08.026
I only taught two years, no.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.487
But did you find that it drained?

02:09.587 --> 02:12.810
It diverted you from what you were most... Fundamentally.

02:13.630 --> 02:14.791
Fundamentally.

02:14.811 --> 02:19.455
It doesn't seem like it when it's happening, because if you're teaching and you're really succeeding at it, it feels so good.

02:19.956 --> 02:22.218
You think to yourself, well, this can't be bad.

02:22.818 --> 02:28.483
But what it does here, it somehow lessens your tolerance for the kinds of

02:28.936 --> 02:36.223
and I don't want to make it sound overly dramatic, but peculiar kinds of agonies that are involved in writing a book.

02:36.243 --> 02:42.329
If you're being satisfied on some other level, it lessens your tolerance for the agonies of writing a book.

02:42.349 --> 02:45.692
You need to write a book as well as you possibly can.

02:45.712 --> 02:56.142
As far as I'm concerned, it requires complete application, because you have to generate your satisfactions beyond the particular grievances that the book creates.

02:56.425 --> 03:01.130
teaching out there and making you happy and pleasing, teaching the students.

03:01.150 --> 03:02.952
You're getting your satisfaction from someplace else.

03:05.075 --> 03:07.818
This book, and we really won't talk that much about the novel.

03:07.898 --> 03:09.220
That's my job, is to read it.

03:09.580 --> 03:14.105
I'm at ease talking about... Not talking about the novel.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.728
I mean, you'd rather not... I mean, I'm at ease not talking about it.

03:16.748 --> 03:22.335
Okay, yeah, that was just... Yeah, my job is to read the... Yeah, it's not your job to tell me what you meant.

03:22.355 --> 03:25.318
That's my job to figure it out, and I've enjoyed it enormously, but...

03:25.501 --> 03:31.229
We will talk about a few peripheral things, and I just spent an hour on the radio talking to a guy about the book.

03:31.249 --> 03:34.333
It just practically bored him in the ceiling.

03:34.353 --> 03:35.795
Yeah, I mean, he's supposed to read it.

03:36.436 --> 03:37.457
It would be anything.

03:37.537 --> 03:38.899
Oh, yeah, that's great.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.301
We're just talking about it, as you say.

03:42.063 --> 03:44.567
Whatever I mean, some guy walked up to me in a bookstore yesterday.

03:45.027 --> 03:49.133
I was there in a signing book, and the guy said to me, Ah, you write this book?

03:49.173 --> 03:50.054
I said, yeah, I don't know.

03:50.074 --> 03:51.116
I said, well, what's it about?

03:51.837 --> 03:54.360
I said, it's about 451 pages here reading it.

03:55.032 --> 04:01.202
It was a little bit rude to him, but everything I know about Independence Day, I put in it.

04:02.545 --> 04:05.229
I can't do anything better than what I did.

04:05.309 --> 04:09.376
At least somebody should allow you the courtesy of knowing what the book is about.

04:10.137 --> 04:18.812
Give the person the respect for all the work and the energy and the love and passion that went into it to at least know

04:19.788 --> 04:24.055
or at least have a decent team not to ask, you know what I'm saying?

04:24.075 --> 04:46.791
Well, he meant, you know, it was just a throwaway line, a throwaway line, but unfortunately it was a throwaway line about my book to me, so I just put it in his hand, which was kind of an aggressive thing to do, because then I pinned him to the buyer's thing, because there, you know, he had to have my book in his hand, and he didn't want to buy it, and had to figure out something to say while I was sitting there to get himself off the hook, which actually, I'm sorry, seems quite excruciating to watch.

04:47.041 --> 04:52.089
He had to stare at it as though it were an art object.

04:52.109 --> 04:55.134
But there are a certain few things I want to ask you about.

04:55.675 --> 04:57.297
I read all this.

04:57.317 --> 04:59.841
Knopf, I have to say, sent out a terrific press kit on you.

05:00.062 --> 05:01.063
I'll tell you, Knopf.

05:01.804 --> 05:02.145
Knopf.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.492
I like to see everything that's been done.

05:06.512 --> 05:08.034
People say, I don't want to see what's been done.

05:08.154 --> 05:09.897
I say, what a fool you are.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.441
You should read everything that you can that's been done about a person.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.012
I should know as much about you as I possibly can.

05:15.253 --> 05:17.016
You got all the stuff from all my other publishers.

05:17.036 --> 05:20.662
Yeah, and it's terrific, but the profiles are good.

05:21.203 --> 05:23.768
I mean, I know what people have said about you often.

05:23.788 --> 05:30.700
I don't know whether they're copying each other or you write about these desperate down-and-out characters in your early books.

05:31.270 --> 05:36.118
Although I always think of them as people trying to make their life better, you know, it's kind of a half-time empty business.

05:36.138 --> 05:37.300
I always see the glasses in full.

05:37.420 --> 05:48.659
But certainly with the creation of this character and his appearance, again, this has to be a transitionary moment in your life, creatively, I think.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.769
I've never imagined doing anything like that before, writing a sequel to a book I'd already written.

05:54.789 --> 05:58.054
And so one of the things you are trying to do, as you will find out,

05:58.642 --> 06:05.548
is to find, you know, you use up so much of your life writing books, you use up your history, you use up a certain number of brain cells.

06:06.329 --> 06:08.811
It gets to be a bit of a challenge to find something new to do.

06:09.812 --> 06:12.955
That isn't just new for novels, but a second novelty.

06:12.975 --> 06:16.158
So to have written a sequel was something I never expected to do.

06:16.198 --> 06:20.502
So it's satisfying in the sense that it's something I never imagined doing.

06:21.083 --> 06:26.708
And even though it's a sequel and has something slightly to do with another book, to me it's still a whole new experience.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.823
But why did you feel that you wanted to do the sequel?

06:30.863 --> 06:35.949
Certainly, anyway you said it, he's still 44 years old, and it's in 1988.

06:35.989 --> 06:36.209
Right.

06:36.870 --> 06:39.473
Whereas it was just only five years later.

06:39.513 --> 06:40.174
That's right.

06:40.194 --> 06:42.797
Well, this isn't Rabbit Angstrom.

06:43.497 --> 06:43.698
No.

06:44.519 --> 06:51.126
Some people ask me, I don't know what they quite mean when they say, is this going to be another Rabbit Angstrom?

06:51.146 --> 06:53.268
I always sort of scratch my head and say, well, I don't know.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.230
I don't know why there needs to be another one.

06:55.671 --> 06:56.712
No, this is...

06:57.029 --> 07:04.999
I had the voice somehow still echoing around in my brain, and particularly in my notebook.

07:05.239 --> 07:06.401
I am interested in the notebook.

07:06.581 --> 07:08.243
We'll come back to that, okay, real quick.

07:08.303 --> 07:22.902
But I found all these notes I was accumulating in Frank's voice, and I started trying them out on some of the things that I was interested in distinct from Frank, and I found that Frank actually, that voice that I call Frank, could

07:23.354 --> 07:29.642
negotiate these new subjects, could talk about different things from what he had talked about in the sports writer.

07:30.002 --> 07:34.208
So finally, after a year of kind of revisiting it, I just gave in.

07:34.228 --> 07:35.489
I thought, well, this is a given.

07:35.509 --> 07:38.293
You know, this is what the world has given me to write about.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.395
And so I set off on it.

07:40.996 --> 07:50.408
Very, in some ways, nervous about the idea of a sequel because sequels are sometimes boring to lose.

07:51.164 --> 07:54.007
Sometimes they're just the first book written over again.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.269
Sometimes you run out of stuff in the middle.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.072
Sometimes you don't know why you're doing it anyway.

07:59.092 --> 08:05.820
So I resisted it for a long time, talked myself out of writing the book, but the book kind of wouldn't go away.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.221
It was what I had to write about.

08:07.501 --> 08:17.092
And if I hadn't written about it, I think I would have felt like I was not taking my work at its time.

08:17.152 --> 08:20.175
Because I wanted to write a big book.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.079
a long book, a comprehensive book, as much about America as I could.

08:24.619 --> 08:28.043
And this seemed to give me the opportunity.

08:28.063 --> 08:34.830
Of course, the metaphor of independence is pretty obvious, too, isn't it?

08:34.850 --> 08:35.090
Yeah.

08:35.531 --> 08:36.632
It's about independence.

08:36.652 --> 08:37.152
Right.

08:37.172 --> 08:38.714
It takes place from the 4th of July.

08:38.774 --> 08:40.095
Well, much more American than that.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.256
Yeah, that's what I thought.

08:41.276 --> 08:49.605
I mean, I wanted, you know, there's a great line of, of Dykes, you know, in an essay he wrote about William Dean Howells in which he said he wanted to write a,

08:50.210 --> 09:19.592
novel good enough for america and that's what i wanted to do you know i'm thinking though you've done some uh screenplays this could work you know as a play as a play yeah don't you think so maybe uh you'd have to work on it obviously somebody else would have to work on it i'll tell you because this boy can go work on it no more not this not no no no um i don't want to i don't want to work on this book anymore this book just about broke my ass um

09:19.943 --> 09:21.065
probably in the last year.

09:21.485 --> 09:21.746
Why?

09:22.867 --> 09:27.754
Because it's so long, and it's got, in a sense, it's got so many sentences in it.

09:27.894 --> 09:29.957
It has to be more than length, though.

09:29.977 --> 09:32.180
It has to be just more than the heft of it.

09:32.200 --> 09:48.904
Well, it had some fairly, for me, devious and complicated arguments in it that I felt real responsibility to make sure I had clearly in the book a lot of, you know, a lot of looking at the front and looking at the back

09:49.154 --> 10:02.491
not knowing how to, not knowing what to say to make sure that, you know, all of the novelty things, making things progress, making things consistent, making things hook up, making everything be part of a larger whole that is actually more important than some of its parts.

10:03.172 --> 10:08.319
So that, for me, for the last year, I finished the book, I was in West Rock Street.

10:10.161 --> 10:14.927
I, you know, I was teaching at Harvard.

10:15.869 --> 10:17.811
I just, you know, it was 18 hours a day,

10:18.466 --> 10:24.434
for not ten and a half months every day, including Christmas Day, Thanksgiving, and New Year's.

10:25.195 --> 10:26.496
I just don't want to do that again.

10:26.516 --> 10:27.678
I don't want to get into that.

10:27.898 --> 10:29.380
I don't want to get into that book again.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.783
Do you read your work when it's done?

10:31.803 --> 10:32.604
I know you give readings.

10:32.824 --> 10:34.346
I read the whole book aloud.

10:34.426 --> 10:38.291
I read this book aloud twice this winter.

10:38.632 --> 10:41.315
That was the completely ORS experience.

10:42.156 --> 10:43.918
Do you find things that you'd like to change?

10:44.759 --> 10:44.980
No.

10:45.701 --> 10:46.502
I mean, as you're reading.

10:46.662 --> 10:46.802
No.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.289
I mean, not even a couple of words.

10:49.329 --> 10:51.632
No, no, not a one.

10:52.533 --> 10:53.614
I wouldn't change a word.

10:53.735 --> 10:55.817
And you believe that finished work is finished work.

10:55.857 --> 11:00.163
You'd never go back and screw around with any of the earlier things that you've done.

11:00.263 --> 11:00.503
No.

11:00.904 --> 11:03.007
Do you read your previous work?

11:03.027 --> 11:08.754
I don't read anything aloud past my book of stories.

11:09.916 --> 11:10.436
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

11:10.697 --> 11:12.579
I would read some parts of the sports writer aloud.

11:13.320 --> 11:17.245
But there was a kind of, I made a kind of a, well, I don't want to call it a break.

11:17.883 --> 11:23.368
But my life, my ambitions kind of altered after 1981.

11:24.469 --> 11:29.955
I had a kind of a failure with the book, The Ultimate Good Luck, which failed in the thinking nobody read it.

11:30.856 --> 11:40.725
And I think I thought back then that if I was going to write another book, I was going to have to muscle up in a way that I think I hadn't muscled up to there.

11:40.745 --> 11:41.866
Okay, I did.

11:41.886 --> 11:45.370
That was a failure in finding the audience, but did you consider the book a failure?

11:45.430 --> 11:45.930
No, not at all.

11:46.451 --> 11:46.911
Not at all.

11:47.482 --> 12:07.581
I guess I had to, I thought I had to, my agent said to me when I was lost off into writing this voice letter, she said, you know, you'd better have a big book this time, she said, because you're going to run out of whatever, you know, in other words, what she said to me was, this better do something and get done.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.203
You mean with her or with the publishing?

12:09.323 --> 12:14.428
I think she just meant that I was going to get cast as somebody who couldn't find an audience.

12:15.329 --> 12:16.830
So is there a

12:17.401 --> 12:20.345
An ulterior drive for commercial success?

12:20.405 --> 12:29.036
No, there is a quite profound drive to find an audience, which is quite distinct from commercial success.

12:29.837 --> 12:31.780
They sometimes go hand in hand.

12:33.122 --> 12:35.185
We certainly, with professional writers, we have to live.

12:36.366 --> 12:37.367
But I've lived.

12:37.628 --> 12:46.159
I've lived quite nicely making a living as a writer for the last 12 or so years and do not want, do not need a lot more money.

12:46.831 --> 12:53.939
And I also have a conviction that that tide will turn on me and I'll come to a point where I won't.

12:54.700 --> 13:00.086
Well, you know, I won't be able to write and publish books with some success forever.

13:00.106 --> 13:00.546
I don't think.

13:00.726 --> 13:02.208
I just don't think life goes that way.

13:02.468 --> 13:03.770
Because I'll change.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.912
What you're saying is fashion.

13:05.992 --> 13:09.056
I think your work is a lot more important than being finished.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.859
Everybody's work has a little bit of fashion involved.

13:12.119 --> 13:13.200
I'm not tearing to it.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.762
I'm just doing what I know how to do.

13:15.265 --> 13:19.071
I mean, your good friend Ray Carver says, you're the late Ray Carver.

13:19.151 --> 13:20.012
We're lying for lying.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.775
He says, you're the best for a writer alive.

13:21.795 --> 13:26.923
That's quite a humbling observation, isn't it?

13:27.063 --> 13:31.469
He was a sweet man.

13:31.509 --> 13:35.115
But your peers, you know, had Dr. Rowland.

13:35.135 --> 13:36.577
I mean, to get that blurb that you got.

13:36.597 --> 13:39.902
Walker Percy was my favorite living author when he was alive.

13:40.363 --> 13:43.247
You know, that's heavy stuff.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.852
That's more than just fashionable.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.454
Writing, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

13:47.694 --> 13:56.664
Well, but I mean, no, I just think trying to be realistic, you know, being a writer just simply doesn't promise you anything.

13:56.684 --> 14:04.212
And so I just try to be realistic about the fact that if I write a book that finds an audience this time, well, maybe I'll come close or do it all.

14:04.773 --> 14:08.958
But there's just no promise down the line that I'll keep on being able to do that.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.000
I like looking at the world that way.

14:11.020 --> 14:11.901
I like it.

14:12.286 --> 14:15.629
there is that contingency in the world.

14:15.649 --> 14:26.399
A number of the people who have written about you think of me that you have this parapatetic sense of place, and I've seen some instances where you've disputed that.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.701
Could you address yourself?

14:27.721 --> 14:30.123
Well, I just think that Americans move.

14:30.283 --> 14:33.066
Americans are always movies, and they make sure how this country was settled.

14:33.726 --> 14:41.854
If people landed in one place and didn't like it, or if it didn't like them, and they got up and they went someplace else, and if that didn't work, they went someplace else.

14:42.070 --> 14:52.700
People coming to a new place and trying to be accommodated is utterly American, but it's also the source of a lot of drama.

14:53.300 --> 15:01.287
You know how you move into a new neighborhood, move to a new town, and what kind of things you have to learn, what about the place you bucks you.

15:01.628 --> 15:03.589
It's the source of the drama of anybody's life.

15:03.629 --> 15:12.077
That's why this book is about selling houses and buying houses, because it's in the ultimate American hometown drama.

15:12.513 --> 15:20.945
So I think, I mean, I have moved around a lot, but I don't think that there's anything particularly interesting about that or very unusual.

15:20.965 --> 15:26.532
Yeah, but you haven't staked out for yourself a... No, that's right.

15:26.552 --> 15:30.257
Well, that's because somebody already staked out the Oxford talk before me.

15:30.277 --> 15:34.984
I realized that I didn't know anything about Mississippi that I hadn't read in a book.

15:35.024 --> 15:40.832
The whole of... If you drive around Mississippi right now, particularly the parts I like, the Delta and North Mississippi,

15:41.470 --> 15:57.816
What you'll find is Faulkner everywhere, because he got it so right, and to a certain extent, Mississippians who've all read Faulkner by and large, particularly white people, they're living out a kind of a Faulkner life.

15:57.836 --> 16:00.581
Likewise with you, Dora.

16:01.643 --> 16:02.584
Who did she work for?

16:03.391 --> 16:04.673
Yeah, regardless.

16:04.693 --> 16:31.153
So anyway, I had nothing to write about the South, and so I had, and Walker had done everything, anything I might have wanted to write about the South, given my age, Walker had already done, and I wouldn't have been able to write what Faulkner did, but I knew the South much more in the eyes that Walker knew the South, the suburban South, and I knew that pretty well, and he'd already, unfortunately, circled the square there, so I was kind of made to go out of Mississippi and look at the rest

16:32.787 --> 16:38.847
But you don't really feel the need of a specific place to energize your work.

16:39.048 --> 16:39.228
No.

16:39.670 --> 16:43.101
You can basically be where you are

16:43.638 --> 16:52.006
Yeah, and one of the news will kick in and do Paris, Milan, West Roxbury, Missoula, New Jersey, Connecticut.

16:52.026 --> 16:52.987
New Jersey, Connecticut, sure.

16:53.007 --> 16:56.270
Well, you're a dream for me, you know, because I have newspapers in Connecticut.

16:56.290 --> 16:57.011
I've got New London.

16:57.051 --> 16:58.953
I've got two papers in New Jersey.

16:59.213 --> 16:59.333
Yeah.

16:59.353 --> 17:02.977
Every place that you've been, you know, I have people.

17:03.037 --> 17:04.118
Well, I try.

17:04.138 --> 17:06.420
You know, they always seem wonderful for me, really.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.682
That's what's good for me.

17:09.063 --> 17:12.126
But I always didn't like the idea of regional writing.

17:12.916 --> 17:16.261
in the sense that... It's so American, though, excuse me for interrupting, though.

17:16.281 --> 17:17.523
To be a regional writer.

17:17.543 --> 17:22.711
Yeah, I mean, it is, and he's certainly, the Americans seem to be more regional than him.

17:23.192 --> 17:38.316
I think it's less the case now, because in the time that I've been a writer, I notice when I go to Montana, where I've been part of the year, A, there are a lot of Southerners out there who've lived, who've lived through the second generation of it, and I notice the language.

17:39.005 --> 17:48.918
The language that people speak, partly because of radio and TV, partly because of superpowers, the language, people speak the same language, the same locutions, the same metaphors.

17:50.019 --> 18:02.435
So I find that, if anything, a wish to address the whole country rather than to address religion is a promising and fruitful, even helpful thing to do.

18:03.516 --> 18:08.623
I don't want to talk about the country as though I were at its exponent, but...

18:09.886 --> 18:13.870
There's something to hold it together.

18:13.890 --> 18:24.741
And literature itself won't do it, but one of the consequences of multiculturalism is that you have, you know, fanatical pluralism.

18:24.861 --> 18:27.263
And everybody else is adversaries.

18:27.283 --> 18:33.149
The whole business about whether or not to speak English or not, also, they'll pull this country limb from limb.

18:33.169 --> 18:39.876
And I would rather be in the guard of people who want to try to hold it together as a writer.

18:40.717 --> 18:46.844
I believe people have to speak English.

18:46.884 --> 18:51.590
I assure you I'll use that quote.

18:51.690 --> 18:52.712
I speak three languages.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.213
I grew up learning languages.

18:54.814 --> 18:59.280
What are the other two?

19:00.361 --> 19:07.129
I believe anybody who comes to this country who speaks Spanish, who speaks French, who speaks Portuguese, should

19:08.172 --> 19:16.320
Find ways to keep their native language alive, but you need to speak English.

19:16.580 --> 19:20.564
It is the American language.

19:21.605 --> 19:22.025
I'm sorry.

19:22.045 --> 19:24.547
I'm a liberal.

19:24.567 --> 19:35.698
I hate to use publishing words like breakthrough books, but would you consider that a book that brought you from one level of recognition?

19:35.965 --> 19:46.502
I guess it did, but I'm like you, I don't like that notion of a breakthrough book because I wrote it just like I wrote the other two, which was to say totally flat out and get my very best at it.

19:46.902 --> 19:53.413
And moreover though, you know, when it came out, when the sports writer came out, it didn't get great reviews.

19:53.433 --> 19:57.799
It got a very sort of dismissive review in the New York Sunday Times.

19:57.819 --> 20:00.724
But I'll bet I know why, because it was a paperback original.

20:01.531 --> 20:03.013
Well, it got a big review, though.

20:03.253 --> 20:04.175
It was Alice Hoffman.

20:04.195 --> 20:06.778
She just said, you know, this book isn't really very good.

20:06.798 --> 20:07.459
Isn't that interesting?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.881
I didn't realize she reviewed it.

20:08.961 --> 20:09.301
Yeah.

20:09.702 --> 20:11.684
She's an interesting woman.

20:11.885 --> 20:12.646
I've never met her.

20:12.666 --> 20:13.247
I hope never.

20:13.267 --> 20:15.169
I didn't read her last week's second time.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.073
She's kind of set on a track, I think.

20:18.453 --> 20:23.040
Well, I think she was writing books by her own lights when she met her.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.823
She was, in other words, like a lot of American writers.

20:25.883 --> 20:29.428
And suddenly something happened to her readership, and it just exploded.

20:30.168 --> 20:32.250
And I don't think she's writing books any differently.

20:32.310 --> 20:35.353
I'm sure she's going along writing the most important books she knows how to write.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.796
But her readership just went... Off the scale.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.717
Yeah, which is great, you know.

20:41.618 --> 20:49.125
I wish she had been a little more generous with me because I was doing nothing but what she was doing.

20:49.145 --> 20:52.348
But anyway, it didn't feel like a breakthrough book at the time.

20:53.489 --> 20:54.750
It did pretty well.

20:54.770 --> 20:58.013
I think it's all 60,000, 70,000, which is... Ten years.

20:58.293 --> 20:59.755
Okay, did it take time to hit that?

20:59.775 --> 21:00.175
See, that's...

21:01.117 --> 21:03.299
They can say 60,000 now, can't they?

21:03.319 --> 21:04.240
90.

21:05.001 --> 21:06.803
But it certainly does have a cachet, though.

21:06.843 --> 21:08.084
Everybody knows the sports story.

21:08.104 --> 21:09.366
They've read a lot.

21:09.386 --> 21:10.607
It gets taught in colleges.

21:11.067 --> 21:18.635
People come up to me sometimes and say, you know, I read your book, Going Through a Divorce, or I read your book, Going Through a Bad Town in My Life, Women and Men Together.

21:18.655 --> 21:24.562
And for some reason or another, it kind of caught a little bit of the country's attention.

21:24.582 --> 21:29.807
Going back to what you said earlier, you heard Frank's voice, and it was there, and it was there, and he wouldn't let go.

21:30.344 --> 21:32.726
He must be pretty special to you then, I mean.

21:32.806 --> 21:33.186
He is.

21:33.387 --> 21:42.975
You know, and the Robert Angstrom question is kind of pertinent because, you know, he is perceived as the alter ego or the extension of Updike.

21:43.335 --> 21:48.639
And I suppose there are those who are wondering if this might not be the case with you.

21:52.423 --> 21:59.929
I wouldn't say so because I write about other people who are very different from Frank.

22:00.854 --> 22:07.601
who I would think, if I only wrote about them, one would also say maybe they're my alter ego.

22:07.622 --> 22:18.273
Maybe it's true that writers, if they are aspirant, have a lot of alter egos, because I do think that characters that you write do participate in your own character to some extent.

22:18.854 --> 22:20.776
But I wouldn't say Frank was my alter ego.

22:20.836 --> 22:28.785
No, he does contain a part of me, but all those guys I've written about in Montana, they contain another part of me, and the women out there.

22:29.322 --> 22:36.692
Also, the other thing is, of course, I don't think of Frank as being the only person in the book.

22:36.912 --> 22:39.796
Those kids in the book are hugely important to me.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.643
There's a line from Graham Greene.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.188
He said, to be a writer, you have to be able to be a lot of different people.

22:48.208 --> 22:52.253
I think that's just something I always thought I could do.

22:53.435 --> 22:55.017
How important is the story to you?

22:55.798 --> 22:56.359
Very important.

22:57.031 --> 23:01.457
I don't think I, I couldn't write books if they knew the story, you know, in the sense that I wasn't.

23:06.004 --> 23:12.332
I mean, well, I thought you were, we all needed to get, because it did have this nice view of the garden.

23:12.773 --> 23:14.275
This is just, you don't worry about it.

23:14.295 --> 23:17.440
No, it's my, room service is my idea of heaven.

23:18.121 --> 23:19.122
It's nice, isn't it?

23:19.142 --> 23:19.903
Yes, it is.

23:20.504 --> 23:22.587
I used to stay at the Chateau Marmont, you know.

23:22.607 --> 23:23.168
Is that right?

23:23.188 --> 23:26.953
And I always stay in the Chateau Marmont, and boy, to have a,

23:27.862 --> 23:33.629
to have a tuna melt in the Chateau Marmont at about 11 o'clock at night, overlooking the lights of L.A.

23:33.649 --> 23:37.273
is, you know, that's as good as it gets, as far as I'm concerned.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.735
It's not as good as it gets in L.A.

23:39.296 --> 23:42.239
You know, this is basically, by the way, a club sandwich with grilled chicken.

23:42.259 --> 23:43.961
That's kind of what I thought when we were looking at it.

23:44.342 --> 23:46.304
Does it have any bacon in there?

23:46.384 --> 23:48.467
Yeah, it has bacon in there.

23:48.567 --> 23:49.047
That's good.

23:49.308 --> 23:50.389
Stuff, so there you go.

23:52.812 --> 23:53.753
Let's go back to it.

23:53.773 --> 23:55.075
Plus, the tea has clove in it.

23:55.655 --> 23:57.818
My gosh, you just don't eat simple here, do you?

23:58.186 --> 24:06.174
This has got an equal rating, you know, now with the Ritz, in terms of those who do the ratings.

24:06.194 --> 24:10.899
Well, let me say, because I wish you would print this.

24:14.582 --> 24:24.552
I was kicked out of the Ritz, where I was a guest, likewise to Copley, where I was a guest, for wearing my best blue jeans in the bar.

24:25.653 --> 24:27.315
Never again, I said.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.301
Made a big stink in the Ritz bar by her.

24:30.182 --> 24:32.786
Said the F word a few times quite loudly.

24:34.248 --> 24:34.728
That happens.

24:35.309 --> 24:37.492
That's why I stay in the Four Seasons.

24:37.512 --> 24:38.533
But it's a beautiful hotel.

24:38.813 --> 24:42.839
I mean, you're not, you haven't gone down in class.

24:42.859 --> 24:44.381
Do you have any plans for a prank?

24:44.401 --> 24:44.801
I mean, no.

24:45.782 --> 24:46.443
No.

24:46.463 --> 24:47.224
No.

24:47.244 --> 24:49.187
Frank's on.

24:49.247 --> 24:54.053
Frank was, when I first dispensed with him, he's gone back in the closet.

24:54.073 --> 24:55.915
Which doesn't mean he's going to come back as a gay man.

24:56.977 --> 24:57.117
Mm-hmm.

24:57.299 --> 25:00.543
I don't have any plans for him, no.

25:00.563 --> 25:07.593
That's not to say that he might not come back in some future... He could, he could, but not in any way that I know.

25:08.334 --> 25:12.580
Well, then, did your dealings with him in this instance satisfy?

25:13.621 --> 25:15.564
But my dealings with him in the last time satisfied.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.626
Yeah, but you said his voice was still there, you could still hear him.

25:17.646 --> 25:27.019
He came back five years later, so I extinguished his... I mean, I had a great deal of affection for the process of writing about him when I would read some paragraphs that I wrote

25:27.792 --> 25:31.335
about him at the end of the book, I thought, gee, I'm glad to have written those paragraphs.

25:31.395 --> 25:32.236
I'm glad those are there.

25:32.856 --> 25:34.898
So he lived in that peculiar way.

25:35.619 --> 25:42.825
But this book is still so fresh in my mind, and pretty much I'm right up against it.

25:43.245 --> 25:46.588
I couldn't imagine looking around it and seeing down the road anything else.

25:47.509 --> 25:52.954
Do you think of your body of work as a body of work, as a corpus, that that should really be?

25:54.075 --> 25:57.698
Well, I feel like if I went ahead and do it

25:58.015 --> 26:01.640
and did what I've been doing, that it might achieve that.

26:01.660 --> 26:06.127
I mean, I've got sort of separate parts of a body of work.

26:06.267 --> 26:15.782
I've got a part of a body of work that takes place in Montana, part of a body of work that takes place in the Northeast, a beginning, a little smaller body of work that takes place in Paris.

26:17.003 --> 26:22.451
I don't think it'll ever, you know, it won't ever be cohesive in the sense of Yacht-Nippertafa.

26:23.493 --> 26:26.858
But again, using Mr. Updack as an example,

26:28.306 --> 26:29.147
He's written about it.

26:29.167 --> 26:30.248
He writes all over the map.

26:30.728 --> 26:32.470
He writes about everything.

26:32.711 --> 26:42.020
But I, you know, frankly, conferring on somebody's work the idea of a corpus, that's for somebody who teaches at Amherst to do, you know.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.482
I can't do that about my own work.

26:43.522 --> 26:45.203
I just think of it as ongoing.

26:46.625 --> 26:53.091
Well, I did an interview with Nadine Gordon McGill, and she was giving me a child's early in Norton lectures.

26:53.131 --> 26:55.714
She made an interesting observation.

26:56.572 --> 27:22.123
she's described, and she's got tons of books, you know, she compares it to a statue in a room, and walking in, and every book is looking at the statue from a different angle, the same piece of sculpture, but she's looking at it, and every book, even though she doesn't intend it to be that, she seems to feel that she's writing basically the same

27:22.795 --> 27:24.317
So she has a theme, she thinks.

27:24.458 --> 27:27.202
She thinks she has a... I guess, that's right.

27:27.883 --> 27:36.717
You can get from that as much as I can, but it is an interesting observation on how she perceives her own work.

27:36.737 --> 27:37.979
She's a woman I know quite well.

27:38.821 --> 27:45.552
She's a woman who does not make offhand remarks.

27:45.572 --> 27:48.416
If she said that, by God, that's what she meant.

27:48.436 --> 27:50.119
Well, I quoted it.

27:50.352 --> 27:53.076
I mean, it wasn't one of those little toss-off amounts that she made a regret.

27:53.116 --> 27:54.378
No, no, no, it was considered.

27:54.398 --> 27:54.858
Oh, yeah.

27:54.959 --> 28:00.627
And she was very pleased that I had the tape recorded because she wanted to be sure that I got the quotations.

28:00.647 --> 28:01.288
She's not one of them.

28:01.308 --> 28:02.810
The quotation's precisely correct.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.652
A certain pipe on this.

28:04.773 --> 28:05.394
That's right.

28:07.396 --> 28:07.997
Which is fine.

28:08.378 --> 28:09.580
She ought to be proud of her work.

28:09.660 --> 28:10.681
It's remarkable.

28:12.203 --> 28:14.807
Of course, winning the Nobel Prize doesn't...

28:15.057 --> 28:18.561
with an enormous amount of... I was talking to Pat Conway this week.

28:18.581 --> 28:20.663
I don't know how... You and he are two... Nice man.

28:21.244 --> 28:22.045
Wonderful, Pat.

28:22.065 --> 28:24.727
I was just in New York with a Wednesday.

28:24.747 --> 28:26.389
And nine years for this book.

28:26.409 --> 28:27.911
And he says, you know what it's like?

28:27.971 --> 28:31.335
He says, I never expected Prince of Tides to become Prince of Tides.

28:31.515 --> 28:32.276
No, sure you didn't.

28:32.296 --> 28:35.259
You know, he says, all of a sudden, they give me how many millions of dollars?

28:35.279 --> 28:42.887
He said, I never need this kind of... Basically, he says, but all of a sudden, I have to write in my mind a million-dollar book.

28:43.255 --> 28:48.860
He really did feel that he was carrying this baggage.

28:49.741 --> 28:54.785
Do you feel the added weight of baggage each time out that you have to at least equalize and pass them?

28:55.626 --> 29:04.714
What I feel is that I would like to broaden my readership.

29:06.116 --> 29:12.081
And if my books are not broadening their readership, then I'm going nowhere.

29:12.955 --> 29:14.597
And that's all.

29:15.217 --> 29:15.798
That's all I feel.

29:15.818 --> 29:26.669
Because as to the perks of being a writer, you know, people thinking that you're a good guy and reading your work and, you know, getting this and getting that, I don't need anything.

29:27.610 --> 29:33.896
All I want to do is get people to read my work, and that's all.

29:35.658 --> 29:41.764
I mean, I would feel like I was doing good.

29:42.689 --> 29:44.692
In fact, I get more people to read books.

29:44.712 --> 29:47.496
Mine.

29:47.516 --> 29:49.679
It's an interesting concept to explore.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.643
It's not enough for you to write and to know the work is good.

29:53.104 --> 29:57.570
No, it's not.

29:57.590 --> 30:00.294
It has to fund the readership.

30:00.314 --> 30:02.457
That's not true if I was 25 years old.

30:03.499 --> 30:06.122
That fueled me when I was 25 years old.

30:06.723 --> 30:10.789
But 26 years later, I have to...

30:11.427 --> 30:15.531
I have to do what writers have to do, which is to say, write and be read.

30:16.252 --> 30:18.374
Does that validate the work for you, in a way?

30:19.455 --> 30:23.579
It makes it seem worthwhile.

30:23.659 --> 30:25.121
It makes it seem useful.

30:25.601 --> 30:29.485
I want to write books that are useful for people.

30:29.505 --> 30:41.097
I read, and please don't misunderstand me, it's just from the stories that I read, but you seem to take, when a reviewer can be a jerk, I guess, sir.

30:41.482 --> 30:44.565
be hurtful or not understand, it upsets you.

30:44.585 --> 30:47.447
You can't ignore yourself from what I've seen.

30:47.647 --> 30:47.848
Nope.

30:47.948 --> 30:49.049
I'm trying to put this down.

30:49.069 --> 30:49.649
I have things, Jim.

30:50.890 --> 30:51.511
I have things, Jim.

30:52.492 --> 30:58.357
Because if you review my books badly, you probably made an enemy out of me.

31:01.720 --> 31:07.705
So don't come around and want to be my pal after you've reviewed my books badly because you will not find a friend.

31:08.526 --> 31:11.168
Because what you've done, basically, if you review my books badly,

31:11.705 --> 31:15.891
As you've said to readers who haven't read my book, don't read this guy's book.

31:16.812 --> 31:23.722
Well, that's a formula.

31:23.742 --> 31:26.286
Do you equate badly with negatively?

31:26.486 --> 31:26.706
Yes.

31:31.634 --> 31:33.656
I should say I make one exception there.

31:34.438 --> 31:41.087
People who are regular book reviewers, people who have a track record, whose tastes are known, whose prelections are

31:41.506 --> 31:42.187
available.

31:43.228 --> 31:44.549
I make some exceptions, too.

31:46.030 --> 31:54.258
But when colleagues review your book and drive people away from it, I take no prison in that.

31:54.418 --> 31:54.879
And I agree.

31:55.339 --> 31:59.803
As one who's been writing professionally about books, I would never publish a review.

31:59.843 --> 32:06.590
For instance, I was a book review editor for any number of years.

32:07.010 --> 32:11.074
To his credit, he just said, Nick, you get him.

32:11.543 --> 32:12.444
You don't worry about them.

32:12.825 --> 32:22.418
And see, there is a, and that's because Pat knows what only a guy like Pat can know, only a guy who's had the life that Pat's had to know.

32:22.938 --> 32:24.120
Readers mean everything.

32:24.841 --> 32:32.612
A bad review in Time Magazine is not going to drive a significant number of Pat Conroy faithful away from this book.

32:32.632 --> 32:38.239
And so he thinks to himself, who I'm writing for is going to read this book.

32:38.339 --> 32:38.800
There they are.

32:39.353 --> 32:40.254
That's the connection.

32:41.075 --> 32:42.497
And no amount of bad reviews.

32:42.517 --> 32:47.705
Now, that's true for people with smaller readerships, you know.

32:48.806 --> 32:50.449
Probably that's true for me.

32:50.469 --> 32:55.636
I mean, but I do cut people slack who are professional reviewers.

32:55.736 --> 33:00.743
I do believe that I can write a book that somebody wouldn't like.

33:01.925 --> 33:02.906
I don't think that's crazy.

33:03.827 --> 33:07.212
But, you know, what can I say?

33:07.252 --> 33:09.175
Piss on my book?

33:09.914 --> 33:10.595
You made an enemy.

33:11.056 --> 33:16.103
There you are.

33:18.045 --> 33:22.832
I'm amused also, in a nice way, in a very pleasant, agreeable way.

33:25.756 --> 33:35.550
You make it very clear that you were not born to be a writer, that you studied hotel management, I guess, and you did a semester at law school.

33:36.090 --> 33:37.913
This isn't something that has obsessed you

33:38.247 --> 33:41.830
from your earliest recollections, and that is pretty interesting.

33:41.990 --> 33:44.893
I mean, you can't say that you were born to be a writer.

33:45.834 --> 33:46.675
Made myself a writer.

33:47.496 --> 33:50.779
Yeah, but that's not possible with everybody, is it?

33:50.799 --> 33:52.861
I mean, I for one don't believe that anybody can be a writer.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.224
Well, I don't know if that's true.

33:56.264 --> 34:07.174
More people than are writers could be writers if they wanted to, you know, perform those practices, dedicate yourself to your own responses to things, and

34:08.572 --> 34:10.615
work hard to the exclusion of all else.

34:11.376 --> 34:14.020
But no, probably everybody couldn't be a writer.

34:15.743 --> 34:28.341
My wife, who's the smartest person I know, probably wouldn't want to write novels, probably couldn't write novels.

34:28.502 --> 34:32.387
Which she says herself, and she could probably write a better one than she thinks.

34:32.988 --> 34:33.950
But no.

34:35.492 --> 34:36.874
For me, it was just a matter of

34:38.795 --> 34:51.408
coming, getting kind of beefed in a very early part of my life, not being able to do anything very well to my satisfaction, starting off wanting to write stories because I hadn't already proved to myself I couldn't do it.

34:52.749 --> 35:01.058
Also, I was led to it by having, by reading having meant so much to me.

35:01.078 --> 35:06.844
I thought maybe I could do for a reader what books had done for me, which is to lift me up.

35:07.651 --> 35:09.513
Any authors in particular?

35:09.553 --> 35:11.675
Well, you know, the regular ones.

35:11.695 --> 35:24.308
I mean, Eudora and Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor and a lot of Southerners, you know, Sherwood Anderson and Isaac Babo and Scott Fitzgerald.

35:24.328 --> 35:25.929
What's your next interview?

35:25.949 --> 35:26.850
Well, we'll just be cool.

35:27.411 --> 35:28.572
It's only got ten minutes.

35:29.092 --> 35:29.313
Hello.

35:30.714 --> 35:30.934
Hi, honey.

35:33.096 --> 35:34.738
Okay, we're just about finishing our lunch.

35:35.393 --> 35:37.776
If we were about eight minutes, would that be okay?

35:38.717 --> 35:39.097
All right.

35:39.778 --> 35:39.978
No.

35:40.559 --> 35:42.241
We'll just come down when we're finished.

35:42.301 --> 35:42.642
Okay.

35:42.662 --> 35:43.102
Thank you.

35:43.322 --> 35:44.264
And does she want to come up here?

35:44.364 --> 35:45.545
Because it's nice and quiet up here.

35:46.646 --> 35:51.512
But unless, I mean, if there's a quiet place, that's what I would like.

35:51.572 --> 35:52.433
It doesn't have to be here.

35:53.815 --> 35:56.678
You just think about it when I come downstairs.

35:57.279 --> 35:57.579
Okay.

35:57.719 --> 35:58.841
Bye.

35:59.762 --> 35:59.882
Sorry.

36:02.140 --> 36:03.882
Yeah, I got plenty of stuff to write.

36:03.902 --> 36:05.624
I wish you had a nice lunch out of this thing.

36:05.644 --> 36:06.645
I love this thing.

36:06.665 --> 36:11.770
I wanted a nice, quiet place where we could just... Just a nice... We've got to sign a couple of books, too.

36:15.635 --> 36:15.775
Mm-hmm.

36:15.795 --> 36:19.058
So many things that... I'm not going to ask you questions that other people have asked you.

36:21.841 --> 36:27.928
I find that you are very comfortable writing, creating male characters or...

36:29.242 --> 36:34.569
But I feel uncomfortable, I think maybe my best characters are women.

36:34.589 --> 36:48.867
I don't have to narrate books necessarily, but... You're not afraid to try and make a woman... Notion that women, this rabid notion that men can't know anything about women.

36:50.148 --> 36:52.031
I mean, women are on men's minds a lot.

36:52.712 --> 36:55.435
Men can know quite a lot about women.

36:55.617 --> 37:10.191
They don't necessarily know everything at all, and their word isn't the last word, but... I take great pleasure writing about women because I try to give them wonderful lines to say.

37:10.992 --> 37:16.878
And I think if I'm giving characters wonderful lines, that I'm making them controllers of their own fate.

37:17.839 --> 37:22.924
If they're speaking grammatically into the world, talking about what's important, I don't know what else you can do.

37:23.461 --> 37:29.067
with characters besides martyring them to give them a stature in a book.

37:29.127 --> 37:31.530
So I feel like I deal with women quite well.

37:31.590 --> 37:39.098
I've actually never had anybody convince me that I wrote about women badly.

37:39.118 --> 37:44.544
In fact, I've had a lot of women say, I don't know why people say you write about women less well than you write about men.

37:44.584 --> 37:45.205
I don't think so.

37:45.225 --> 37:49.210
So I feel corroborated about writing about women.

37:49.230 --> 37:51.392
And let me just go back because you say you write

37:52.064 --> 37:54.587
what's most important to you is to get that readership.

37:54.607 --> 37:56.489
Do you have a sense of who the readership is?

37:57.671 --> 38:01.255
And then as a corollary to that, do you write for that readership?

38:01.395 --> 38:03.497
Do you have this readership in mind when you write?

38:03.517 --> 38:04.579
Who do I think I write for?

38:08.543 --> 38:10.666
Not college professors.

38:10.686 --> 38:11.487
Not book reviewers.

38:12.648 --> 38:20.417
But maybe somebody who was 20 years old who was serious and

38:20.650 --> 38:23.914
who needed, in some ways, to have a life changed by a piece of work.

38:24.655 --> 38:31.404
In other words, I write for somebody who was like I was when literature began to make a big difference to my life.

38:31.944 --> 38:38.813
I mean, I could have read Racine, I could have read Fitzgerald, I could have read Flaubert, I could have read George Eliot at that age.

38:39.834 --> 38:44.059
You know, I don't mean I write for kids.

38:44.660 --> 38:45.001
I don't.

38:45.421 --> 38:46.342
I write for adults.

38:46.783 --> 38:50.067
Writing for that person who needs a book

38:50.738 --> 38:53.581
you know, for whom a book could make a difference.

38:53.601 --> 38:56.884
And you perceive this as your readership as well.

38:56.904 --> 38:59.527
You write for that reader.

38:59.947 --> 39:00.308
Yeah.

39:00.328 --> 39:02.470
You also perceive that that is who your reader is.

39:02.530 --> 39:03.671
Yeah, it is.

39:04.252 --> 39:08.035
Although I've had people come in to book signings who said that they read my books.

39:08.095 --> 39:13.501
I remember Toby Wolfe and I were someplace, and some guy said, you know, I read your books on my tractor when I have lunch.

39:13.581 --> 39:15.163
I'm on the phone.

39:15.183 --> 39:19.547
I thought to myself, ah, Jonathan, you're going to eat your heart out.

39:20.540 --> 39:24.364
because he had not long before said that nobody read my work because it wasn't any good.

39:24.384 --> 39:25.125
That's what he actually said.

39:25.305 --> 39:25.806
Jesus.

39:25.826 --> 39:27.628
He said, this guy shouldn't even be writing books.

39:27.668 --> 39:28.709
Nobody reads him anyway.

39:30.191 --> 39:31.512
What an asshole.

39:31.532 --> 39:31.612
Wow.

39:31.792 --> 39:32.653
I said it.

39:33.254 --> 39:34.435
He will not be allowed into heaven.

39:38.980 --> 39:46.989
I have to say, you're the first writer I've seen, I've met, and I've met hundreds of them, literally, who actually can give a specific date for when he became a writer.

39:47.029 --> 39:50.293
I saw that in January, 65, something like that.

39:50.678 --> 39:51.679
Isn't that great?

39:51.699 --> 39:53.641
I became a writer on such and such a date.

39:55.083 --> 39:55.183
Yeah.

39:55.203 --> 39:56.884
My mother said to me, what are you going to do with yourself?

39:57.605 --> 39:58.686
I said, I think I'm going to be a writer.

40:01.569 --> 40:02.710
I never looked back.

40:04.432 --> 40:09.217
And then once you committed yourself to it, would you say you're obsessive?

40:09.558 --> 40:09.978
No.

40:09.998 --> 40:11.760
Well, I have been with this book.

40:13.962 --> 40:18.947
I would have said I was in a healthy way, very determined up to now.

40:18.967 --> 40:19.588
I think this book

40:20.328 --> 40:22.431
required a certain obsessiveness on my part.

40:22.952 --> 40:32.827
And then where you have also been described by numerous writers as writing often about down-and-out drifters, and then some of these same writers also quote you as saying you're an optimist.

40:33.227 --> 40:34.830
Maybe you could give me a brief quote on that.

40:34.850 --> 40:45.906
Well, I'll just quote you Sartre, that to write about the darkest possible things is itself an act of optimism, because it proves they can be thought about.

40:48.070 --> 40:48.150
Hmm.

40:48.170 --> 40:48.310
I mean,

40:49.150 --> 40:54.335
And that's when I think of an optimist, I think that a story is always optimistic.

40:55.236 --> 41:11.031
Because I give you a story and I say, here's something you will like or you can use or make something of, which necessarily means you have a future, which necessarily means that it posits the possibility of something better.

41:11.092 --> 41:15.476
So I don't know.

41:15.496 --> 41:16.677
It just seems to me that, you know,

41:17.804 --> 41:19.947
necessarily an optimistic gesture.

41:19.967 --> 41:20.628
Great.

41:20.648 --> 41:27.037
And then, why don't we make this the last one so we don't keep your other... Carol waiting too long.

41:28.039 --> 41:31.744
Do you make a distinction between the fictive world and the real world?

41:32.806 --> 41:35.389
And if you do, which one is the more truthful world?

41:35.410 --> 41:35.930
The real world.

41:36.611 --> 41:37.452
Is more truthful.

41:37.493 --> 41:37.853
Really?

41:37.993 --> 41:38.494
Absolutely.

41:39.736 --> 41:41.338
I didn't expect to say that.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.081
Throw me back on that.

41:43.141 --> 41:43.581
Okay.

41:43.601 --> 41:44.202
Great.

41:44.222 --> 41:46.345
Can you just explain briefly on that?

41:47.207 --> 41:47.507
Well,

41:48.449 --> 42:05.212
For me, fiction is something that one does to bring you back into the real world with heightened acuity, a greater sense of where pleasure lies, a greater sense of what's important.

42:06.654 --> 42:18.169
And you go to fiction basically for instruction of a kind, you know, in the broadest sense, in the Aristotelian sense of instruction, for instruction about the real world.

42:19.533 --> 42:24.785
in that very setup, the fictive world is subordinate to the real world.

42:25.847 --> 42:26.308
That's great.

42:26.930 --> 42:28.653
Want to quit on that?

42:28.914 --> 42:29.315
Yeah.

42:29.335 --> 42:30.758
Will you sign a couple books for me?
