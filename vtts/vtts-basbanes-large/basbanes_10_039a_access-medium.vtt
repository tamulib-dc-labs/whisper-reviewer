00:02.630 --> 00:30.088
The exhibition opens with this magnificent banner, of which you see the Verzo, which is the book plate from the library of Emperor Nicholas II in the Winter Palace.

00:30.575 --> 00:57.325
The book plate was designed by Baron Armin Folkassan, who was the curator of the silver and gold collections of the Hermitage, and it's a magnificent example of fin de siÃ¨cle book design, or book plate design, and the inscription in a stylized old church Slavonic says, the private library of his imperial majesty, the Winter Palace, which is, of course,

00:57.710 --> 00:59.854
the Hermitage now.

01:00.355 --> 01:11.193
Nicholas had about 30,000 volumes in his library in the Winter Palace, some of which are on display here.

01:11.995 --> 01:15.060
I think that he was

01:17.082 --> 01:32.523
an administrator of a vast, very complex, multinational empire, and used books as reference material, and for his leisure reading.

01:32.563 --> 01:39.512
It was a tradition in the Alexander Palace, which was in Tsarskoe Sala, which was the residence of the

01:39.830 --> 01:47.934
the imperial family to relax by reading in the evenings and reading in a variety of languages.

01:48.716 --> 01:50.742
So who acquired the books for him?

01:50.762 --> 01:53.029
He had a private librarian who

01:53.330 --> 02:09.899
He would survey various catalogues and make selections, which the librarians and their co-porteurs in Western Europe would obtain for him.

02:09.939 --> 02:13.045
Of course, they were fluent in many languages.

02:13.686 --> 02:18.274
Were they acquiring for rarity of content?

02:19.013 --> 02:23.805
It depends on the mode of acquisitions, and I'm going to discuss that in a second.

02:24.427 --> 02:35.335
Nicholas, the exhibition, first of all, is very much connected with the centennial of the Slavic and Baltic.

02:35.602 --> 02:42.374
collections we're celebrating our centennial next year.

02:43.196 --> 02:56.260
And in the course of a century, we've served millions of readers ranging from Nabokov to Trotsky to Bukharin to Majakovsky to Jacqueline Kennedy Anassas too.

02:56.240 --> 03:01.548
George Frost Kennan, and General Van Eken, and so on and so on.

03:02.229 --> 03:13.387
And this is a kind of payback to this international clientele that we have served in the course of a century.

03:14.228 --> 03:22.922
And the reason we selected these materials of the hundreds of thousands that we could have shown

03:23.476 --> 03:39.846
is that the materials are very glamorous, the theme is glamorous, and the materials are drawn from all parts of the library's collections.

03:39.926 --> 03:44.775
That is to say, it is not simply from Slavic and Baltic,

03:44.958 --> 04:00.734
This is very important to keep in mind that, for example, Pride of Place here is given to books from the Oriental and from the Aarons collection, where they have Imperial Association volumes, and I'm going to dwell on that.

04:00.874 --> 04:01.374
So it's not all Romanov.

04:01.715 --> 04:06.900
No, it is all Romanov, but it's from different divisions of the library, the music division, the Aarons.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.301
Some of these things were acquired.

04:08.702 --> 04:10.003
They were dispersed.

04:10.186 --> 04:12.733
They were dispersed, and that's the problem.

04:13.094 --> 04:15.160
Now the reconstruction.

04:17.728 --> 04:22.120
This was library practice.

04:22.572 --> 04:24.355
I plead innocence.

04:26.458 --> 04:38.236
So one of the themes, the first themes, I think, of the exhibit, and there are four really underlying themes, I would say, is number one, that the collections here are museological, they're artifactual in nature.

04:38.576 --> 04:44.045
It's not only the Met, it's not only the Museum of Modern Art that has spectacular things to show.

04:44.065 --> 04:45.006
Is that all museological?

04:45.447 --> 04:46.909
I don't know, I just made it up.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.946
Probably not.

04:50.427 --> 04:51.288
I make up a lot.

04:52.129 --> 05:02.081
In any case, we also have material that is of a museum quality, and we like to show it.

05:02.501 --> 05:05.285
Again, museum quality, the definition being rarity?

05:05.565 --> 05:10.551
Rarity, beautiful silver bindings.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.934
uh, imperial association binding.

05:12.974 --> 05:15.058
So we've- The large significance of content.

05:15.078 --> 05:19.205
That also, that leads me to another theme of the exhibit.

05:19.586 --> 05:24.675
So the artifactual significance, and then secondly, that it's drawn from all of the library's collections.

05:24.695 --> 05:29.704
This is not only Slavic and Baltic division, where you would expect to find such material.

05:29.684 --> 05:36.731
because the 10th case, which is called Western Perspectives on the Romanov, is material in Western.

05:36.771 --> 05:50.403
It's in Italian, it's in French, it's in German, showing also rare books how the Romanov were perceived in Western literature, because the message is that Slavic is not only Slavic language, it's everything relating to these cultures.

05:50.784 --> 05:55.348
So we have a very broad definition of our collections here.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.750
And then maybe the third...

05:57.950 --> 06:20.717
The third theme that I want to emphasize is that the books are not only books beautiful and rare, but they are books that tell us something about the way these individuals view their historic role and their historic obligations in the administration.

06:20.697 --> 06:33.576
of an empire that occupied a sixth of the world's surface, from America to the Elba, and down to the Hawaiian Islands and California.

06:33.636 --> 06:37.783
This is the empire at its height under Nicholas I. Can I ask you a question?

06:37.803 --> 06:37.983
Yes.

06:39.145 --> 06:44.152
This is the first time you have ever exhibited anything from the Romanov.

06:45.234 --> 06:45.474
Yes.

06:46.115 --> 06:50.181
Would such an exhibition have been possible during the Soviet years?

06:51.224 --> 06:53.229
I would have done it with reluctance.

06:53.510 --> 07:00.647
I would have done it with reluctance, but let's save that discussion for a moment.

07:00.808 --> 07:03.114
Just make sure the tape is running fine.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.036
Yeah, it is.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.507
Now, let me just give maybe a fourth.

07:08.875 --> 07:26.496
or a third underlining theme that the books are messengers of how these people who own them which was the ruling elite of the late 19th early 20th century how these individuals

07:28.687 --> 07:39.016
how these individuals recreated with these books, how they explored with these books, how they conducted war with these books.

07:39.176 --> 07:41.683
And you firmly believe they did all these things.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.770
You be the judge.

07:44.930 --> 07:51.686
I'll show you, and let's see whether the case is compelling, how they defended their faith with these books.

07:51.966 --> 08:00.145
In other words, the books as prisms to various activities of this vast...

08:00.125 --> 08:02.109
multicultural empire.

08:02.629 --> 08:07.679
And let's start with the first two cases, which are background cases.

08:07.779 --> 08:19.720
They talk about some of the personages who own these books, and about some of the buildings from which they were nationalized and confiscated by the Soviet government,

08:19.700 --> 08:24.777
after the Bolshevik Revolution, and then into the 20s.

08:25.520 --> 08:32.764
And let me just say that the books were taken from

08:33.149 --> 08:52.440
the books that we have at least, were taken from some of the last emperors, Alexander II, Alexander III, Nicholas II, and the brother of Emperor Alexander III, the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich in 1931.

08:52.690 --> 09:04.010
the library bought about 2,700 volumes from his library, and he, by far, most of the books in this exhibit come from his library.

09:04.271 --> 09:06.514
Were these selected by your predecessors?

09:06.815 --> 09:16.993
These were selected, purchased by primarily Avram Yarmolinsky, who was curator for 40 years, and so many of the greatest acquisitions of

09:17.530 --> 09:23.018
The books of the czars came during his tenure.

09:23.605 --> 09:35.121
with some subsequent... Realize, though, that many of the books, even if they were purchased later, first appeared on the antiquarian book market in the 20s and 30s.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.242
These are historic books.

09:36.322 --> 09:43.672
We knew about them from auction catalogs in the 30s, and they went underground, they resurfaced, they were bought again, and so on.

09:43.712 --> 09:46.116
Yeah, this is a case in point here.

09:46.196 --> 09:48.659
For example, this Ottoman album.

09:48.679 --> 09:50.862
I'm taking it on faith, by the way, that these...

09:51.095 --> 09:53.701
all of these items are in the catalog that I'll be getting.

09:53.981 --> 09:55.384
I don't have to take notes seriously.

09:55.404 --> 09:59.313
No, everything is in the catalog.

09:59.574 --> 10:08.513
So, for example, this item here, Mr. Davis, who's over there, he would probably tell you, this book probably first appeared in the bookmarked

10:08.982 --> 10:10.044
in the 1930s.

10:10.124 --> 10:11.446
The book we're talking about?

10:11.466 --> 10:11.646
Right.

10:11.827 --> 10:16.675
The book is an album of Ottoman watercolors.

10:17.216 --> 10:20.802
This was from the first part of the 19th century.

10:20.842 --> 10:28.855
It was presented to the Russian Tsar to show him how the various Ottoman adversaries appeared.

10:28.895 --> 10:35.226
And here is, you know, one of the viziers, Minister F. Nangea.

10:35.746 --> 10:40.293
appeared to a Russian artist who sketched it.

10:40.714 --> 10:45.301
So let's look a little bit further here.

10:45.321 --> 10:47.504
You don't mind if I occasionally ask a question?

10:47.804 --> 10:48.425
No, not at all.

10:49.247 --> 10:54.895
For example, here... Well, is this a part of their history?

10:54.915 --> 10:57.940
Then you think that the Soviets were eager to...

10:58.409 --> 11:02.173
or they were just kind of... No, I think both.

11:02.874 --> 11:18.031
I mean, why, if you were Lenin or Trotsky, and realize Trotsky and Bukharin worked in this library before World War I, in his memoirs, Trotsky says that the first place that Bukharin dragged him from St.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.434
Mark's place was here to the public library.

11:20.684 --> 11:21.806
in my life.

11:22.267 --> 11:27.999
So, you know, they knew this library, but why would you want to keep these relics of the ancien regime?

11:28.299 --> 11:30.684
I mean, think of what happened after the French Revolution.

11:30.965 --> 11:35.554
You began to expunge, to sell, to nationalize, to

11:36.209 --> 11:38.392
Were books a victim after that period of time?

11:38.412 --> 11:44.900
There have certainly been some manuscript collections and books ended up in Russia, thanks to the Russian rulers again, saving them.

11:45.161 --> 11:47.784
And here we have this situation in reverse.

11:48.245 --> 11:49.446
An unusual continuum.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.649
Yeah, an unusual continuum.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.491
Bizarre continuum.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.054
And this is kind of background material.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.257
All of these are from imperial collections.

11:57.277 --> 12:01.963
This is from the Coronation Album of Emperor Alexander II, one of the biggest books ever published.

12:02.230 --> 12:04.453
Look at the quality of the chromolithography.

12:05.394 --> 12:06.135
It's superb.

12:06.155 --> 12:09.420
You can very easily identify all of the personalities who are here.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.363
For example, the Hungarian ambassador.

12:12.905 --> 12:15.989
This is a printed book.

12:16.009 --> 12:17.451
There were 200 printed.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.494
We have two of them.

12:19.534 --> 12:21.837
We have the French version and the Russian version.

12:22.318 --> 12:23.800
These are all original photographs.

12:24.117 --> 12:31.445
Did you say at the time this material was acquired, this was the smallest collection outside of Russia slash the Soviet Union?

12:31.465 --> 12:36.771
No, it was certainly the most heavily used, because we're celebrating, as I say, our centenary.

12:37.312 --> 12:38.933
But you were in place.

12:39.174 --> 12:43.038
We were in place, and we were ready to leap at the opportunity.

12:43.358 --> 12:49.205
And here, for example, is another coronation album showing the most sacred part of the coronation of Nicholas II.

12:49.365 --> 12:52.048
And here, this cloth,

12:52.484 --> 13:01.459
that you see on the Bishop Desna Bedrinek, you'll see the original in one of the other cases that was sold by the Soviets to Armand Hammer during the 20s.

13:02.702 --> 13:13.220
Again, here one of our readers, Isabel Hapgood, who wrote denunciations to the library director about all of the radicals working in our reading room.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.243
Here, she is in St.

13:15.303 --> 13:16.365
Petersburg,

13:16.987 --> 13:27.318
in 1916, and who writes to her but Empress Alexandra in remembrance of Tsarskoye Sela, Alexandra, in lovely English.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.020
And look at the date.

13:29.040 --> 13:29.941
Yeah, 1916.

13:30.401 --> 13:31.062
Very close.

13:31.082 --> 13:33.905
Yeah, and then this book... December 8th.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.988
Right, fell into the collection of Mrs. Edward Harkness.

13:39.671 --> 13:41.393
A very important page for Mrs. Harkness.

13:41.413 --> 13:42.574
Exactly, right.

13:42.934 --> 13:43.635
Harkness...

13:43.919 --> 13:48.628
I write books.

13:52.275 --> 13:54.439
And so here is the interior.

13:54.780 --> 14:02.715
This is not an emigrate library, but in a way it is, isn't it?

14:02.735 --> 14:03.717
It's the materials.

14:04.203 --> 14:05.104
I'm sorry.

14:05.124 --> 14:07.066
We'll talk about that at another time.

14:07.506 --> 14:14.674
Here is the interior of the library of Nicholas II in the Winter Palace, and here you see the actual room.

14:15.094 --> 14:16.296
It's called the Gothic Library.

14:16.316 --> 14:17.357
The Gothic Library.

14:17.377 --> 14:19.299
That's where so many of these things resided.

14:20.500 --> 14:20.820
Some.

14:21.541 --> 14:22.442
Some of these things.

14:22.522 --> 14:23.663
Here is his book plate.

14:23.723 --> 14:27.407
Here's his book plate, which is a recurring theme in the entire book plate.

14:27.427 --> 14:28.809
Is that the actual book plate?

14:28.889 --> 14:31.932
That's the original, by Baron Folker Sam.

14:32.249 --> 14:34.072
Was it in all those colors?

14:34.292 --> 14:38.379
Yes, that's exactly the way it looks.

14:38.399 --> 14:55.748
Now, here we come to some of the Grand Dukes, whose books are also represented, particularly the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, and here he is in his youth, an original photograph, and here is one of his three residences in St.

14:55.808 --> 14:58.813
Petersburg, next to the Hermitage,

14:59.232 --> 15:06.019
A very powerful figure, usually called the third person in the Russian state at the end of the 19th, beginning of the 20th.

15:06.039 --> 15:15.369
And here's the interior of his library in this building, which held about 65,000 volumes, and realized that we have about 2,700 of these books.

15:15.489 --> 15:18.913
Now, what we're looking at here are photographs and illustrations.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.676
Are these fun?

15:21.696 --> 15:23.097
Are these individual...

15:23.549 --> 15:25.932
These aren't books that we're looking at.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.256
Some were scanned from books that we have.

15:28.316 --> 15:30.619
That's an original photograph, for example.

15:31.140 --> 15:38.971
This is a scan to show the modern thing, and this is a historic photograph of the interior of the library in this building.

15:39.452 --> 15:47.363
And here, for example, is the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, his book plate, and here is his palace, the marble palace.

15:50.954 --> 15:55.481
And here you see other book plates represented in the collection.

15:55.761 --> 16:01.450
So, for example, from Tsarskoe Selov, from Pavlovsk, and so on and so on.

16:02.652 --> 16:06.578
And here, finally, the last of personages and palaces.

16:07.119 --> 16:14.370
Here you see the third coronation album, also magnificent, of Emperor Alexander III, the father of Nicholas.

16:14.771 --> 16:17.395
And here is... That's magnificent.

16:17.415 --> 16:19.358
Here is he...

16:20.232 --> 16:26.597
and the mother, the Danish princess Dagmar, whose 150th anniversary is now being celebrated.

16:26.657 --> 16:35.105
Hi, could I have some kind of schmata, please, because I'm going to do a... I don't have a schmata.

16:35.125 --> 16:35.345
Oh, thanks.

16:35.365 --> 16:40.309
As I go along... I usually have some schmata.

16:40.349 --> 16:40.829
We'll get there.

16:40.849 --> 16:43.712
This is Mr. Baz Baines, who is doing an article.

16:43.732 --> 16:48.396
These are my colleagues, Barbara Serg, Judith Ribichoff, and Mr. Davis, you know?

16:49.156 --> 16:49.817
Welcome to the show, please.

16:52.328 --> 17:09.639
So, the Danish princess Dagmar, whose 150th anniversary is now being celebrated in a show at the Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, a major show.

17:09.659 --> 17:10.640
She died in Copenhagen.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.404
You remember the film Anastasia?

17:12.584 --> 17:17.172
This is Helen Hayes, Helen Hayes' role.

17:20.678 --> 17:25.245
You're pretty proud of this exhibition, you're cleaning the... Yes, I hate smudge marks.

17:27.068 --> 17:30.032
Don't think this doesn't get into this story.

17:30.053 --> 17:30.593
No, I do.

17:32.076 --> 17:34.519
I don't do windows, though.

17:34.539 --> 17:35.521
Only glass cases.

17:35.541 --> 17:38.906
Now, let's go further.

17:40.348 --> 17:42.832
Now, here.

17:44.154 --> 17:48.441
Cases three to eight are the core of the exhibit.

17:49.315 --> 18:17.635
how these materials were utilized by their owners in the palaces in which they resided to deal with issues of empire, its historical memory, the historical memory of empire, how these books were used in various military and foreign policy campaigns, how they were used in exploration, how they were used in travel and leisure,

18:17.834 --> 18:20.017
how they were used in issues of faith.

18:20.778 --> 18:23.623
This is the core, these cases of the exhibit.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.809
And then cases 9 and 10 are again pendants.

18:28.229 --> 18:34.899
They're explicatory material because case 9 says salesmen, sellers, and buyers.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.402
How did the books get here?

18:36.422 --> 18:39.366
Because you look at this stuff and you wonder, well, you know, what's the story?

18:39.686 --> 18:44.854
And then the last case, as I explained, is setting it in the context of library-wide collections.

18:45.053 --> 18:54.267
so that people should not walk away thinking that the Slavic collections are exclusively this kind of material, or in this script, because they're not.

18:55.048 --> 19:02.280
So let's walk... These notes are all in the material that I... Everything is in... Right.

19:02.420 --> 19:05.084
Nicholas, the catalog is over 100 pages.

19:05.104 --> 19:07.027
It's very well illustrated.

19:07.047 --> 19:09.270
Very often the same images.

19:09.751 --> 19:10.352
And here...

19:10.855 --> 19:21.019
All of the regions of the empire, for example, here you see books, bound silver, gold, by Tarzok masters.

19:21.400 --> 19:28.356
You see, for example, how they would present in cases these materials to Vladimir Alexandrovich.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.539
Look at the guild.

19:29.857 --> 19:30.838
.

19:30.858 --> 19:49.140
Someone would come from a city, a delegation, they would make an appointment with the secretary, they would be given a day when they could appear at court, and they would present this formally, these views of particular regions.

19:49.661 --> 19:53.105
And here is one of the rarest items in the entire collection.

19:53.465 --> 19:59.172
This is the super ex libris of Maria Fyodorovna, the wife of Emperor Paul,

19:59.928 --> 20:01.370
who was assassinated in 1801.

20:01.491 --> 20:11.568
One of the earliest books that we have from Romanov Library is the end of the 18th century.

20:11.608 --> 20:12.189
So, 1773.

20:12.229 --> 20:13.551
Exactly.

20:13.591 --> 20:14.713
This is one of the earliest.

20:15.955 --> 20:17.878
Is this your first major exhibition in this room?

20:20.303 --> 20:25.311
No, we've had a Polish exhibition here, but not quite on this scale.

20:25.865 --> 20:31.754
Many of these items here are also books that were presented to the emperor.

20:31.774 --> 20:41.648
For example, a survey of the revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire, obviously of critical significance, prepared by the secret police for the emperor.

20:41.668 --> 20:46.114
Right, on silk, printed on silk.

20:46.154 --> 20:48.037
Here is one item.

20:48.057 --> 20:48.598
Print that on silk.

20:49.085 --> 20:50.126
The Secret Police.

20:50.226 --> 20:52.208
No, this item is on silk.

20:52.328 --> 20:56.872
This is a memorial volume to someone who was assassinated, so it was printed on silk.

20:57.032 --> 21:07.621
Now, here is a description presented to Grand-Dougladimir Alexandrovich of the Great Cathedral of Christ the Savior, which was destroyed by the Soviets in the 20s, now being reconstructed.

21:08.022 --> 21:18.771
Here is another item from Nicholas's library, dealing with a remarkable, wonder-working icon, and you see it's all in silk.

21:18.937 --> 21:42.362
And here you see again the kinds of things in Greek, for example, by Kapo de Istrias, the foreign minister presented to Nicholas I, or these kinds of reports dealing with the external affairs of war,

21:42.595 --> 21:51.690
of the empire, dealing with Bosnia, with the South Slavs, a very actual issue even today, that these books are in the libraries of the Tsar.

21:51.730 --> 21:54.855
Here's a description of Bosnia, a manuscript description.

21:54.915 --> 21:55.757
1865.

21:55.777 --> 21:56.258
Exactly.

21:56.959 --> 22:00.384
So these issues were very much on the minds of the imperial court.

22:00.705 --> 22:03.069
What is going on with our brethren in the South?

22:03.429 --> 22:06.274
And how can we serve as protectors of these people?

22:07.165 --> 22:12.573
Here, similarly, look at this, Anastasia, Grand Duchess Anastasia or Anastasia.

22:13.154 --> 22:17.520
Here, these people lived extremely demanding court lives.

22:17.941 --> 22:19.363
This is from her library.

22:19.423 --> 22:29.538
This collection of photographs from her purse was sponsored a military train during World War I. And here you see surgery being performed in one of the wagons.

22:29.818 --> 22:30.940
And look at the cover of the book.

22:31.281 --> 22:35.687
It's all hand-lettered from Anastasia's library.

22:35.853 --> 22:56.414
Here's another imperial presentation, in this case to Alexander Alexandrovich and Alexander III, a book dealing a memorial volume in honor of the defeat of Napoleon.

22:56.815 --> 23:04.122
And here you see again, 1812, just after Napoleon's defeat from the library of Tsarskoe Selaw,

23:04.473 --> 23:06.640
Napoleon's Pyrrhic victory.

23:06.660 --> 23:09.770
He's pulling back the curtains and Moscow burns.

23:10.733 --> 23:16.491
Now here, military regiments would...

23:17.332 --> 23:22.319
would present to the emperor and empress various volumes like this.

23:22.720 --> 23:32.034
Now, here you see they came and they took the buttons, they took the uniforms, they sewed it into the book binding.

23:33.035 --> 23:38.884
And similarly here, the hat, the perepaha, from Caracol, lambs, wool, is also so.

23:38.864 --> 23:45.032
Now, we're showing for the first time some of the artifacts in our collections, like this from the Bantyukhov Bates collection.

23:45.713 --> 23:48.616
Mrs. Bates will be here tonight, the widow.

23:48.816 --> 23:54.604
He was a military officer, a major translator between Eisenhower and Zhukov during World War II.

23:54.624 --> 24:03.254
We have his swords, and we're showing that menus, for example, from various... Everything here is not from the Roman acquisition.

24:03.334 --> 24:08.601
You have nourished this exhibition with items, other items from...

24:09.880 --> 24:16.268
I would say that 95% of the books are from Romanov collections, but just from background.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.672
And most of the artifacts are from our collection.

24:19.972 --> 24:20.613
Most of the artifacts.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.935
They're not from private collections.

24:22.035 --> 24:24.778
Some artifacts from one private collection.

24:24.839 --> 24:25.259
That's all.

24:26.380 --> 24:31.847
Because this is not a show about silver or swords.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.629
The swords are just background.

24:34.370 --> 24:37.434
And if we happen to have them in the collection, we use them.

24:37.454 --> 24:38.976
And they add to something.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.166
Exploration.

24:42.186 --> 24:42.987
Exploration.

24:43.507 --> 24:50.997
How these people viewed the various peoples of their vast empire, multinational empire.

24:51.017 --> 25:03.874
These are original photographs by de Ruwalt of the various types of people that lived in the empire, the Caucasus, which was a trouble spot then as it is now.

25:04.755 --> 25:10.583
And also these, for example, the photographer, you see he left the fly.

25:10.782 --> 25:13.054
in the photograph, de Ruwalt.

25:16.734 --> 25:18.463
And here you see

25:19.304 --> 25:26.131
Nicholas bought 300 watercolors from the estate of academician Sansa, who was a very prominent artist.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.574
And this is a fraction of the original watercolors.

25:28.614 --> 25:32.738
In this case, a woman of the Don, Tatar peoples.

25:32.939 --> 25:35.181
How many did you acquire for that house?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.524
Excuse me, he acquired 4,000.

25:37.804 --> 25:41.027
We have 300 in the original packing case.

25:41.127 --> 25:41.708
Where are the others?

25:43.310 --> 25:44.751
Dispersed, maybe in Russia.

25:46.473 --> 25:48.095
Kyrgyz, for example.

25:48.175 --> 25:49.176
All the strong, all the people.

25:49.342 --> 25:50.784
Jewish population of Kolder.

25:50.804 --> 25:51.545
Are these culled again?

25:51.825 --> 25:57.293
Do you think these were the best of what was available in the opinion of the acquiring librarian?

25:57.433 --> 25:58.755
They may have been culled.

25:59.115 --> 26:02.480
We don't have any detailed documentation on it.

26:03.461 --> 26:15.197
And here, this is a remarkable item also, a map of Peking that was presented to Nicholas I, showing the Temple of Heaven.

26:15.616 --> 26:32.275
and the forbidden city, and the Russian compounds which surround, because, of course, the Russians had representation in Peking for 300 years, so-called Dukhovna Amicia, map of the United States, railway map.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.385
if only because you're alert to it.

26:38.445 --> 26:38.665
Right.

26:38.945 --> 26:53.222
From the Pavlov's Palace, a description of shamanism on the west coast of the United States from one of the volumes, thanks so much, of Russian explorers.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.024
Now let's go further.

27:04.615 --> 27:04.995
Here,

27:06.899 --> 27:21.453
Again, here, magnificent volume presented to Emperor Alexander III dealing with Central Asia in the so-called Turkestan Exposition of 1886.

27:21.493 --> 27:26.078
Again, showing other original photographs presented.

27:26.398 --> 27:27.519
This was in Chicago.

27:27.579 --> 27:31.523
These are the Russian pavilions in Chicago during the Columbian Exposition.

27:31.563 --> 27:32.064
And this stuff was there?

27:32.084 --> 27:33.065
This material was there?

27:33.305 --> 27:34.506
Exactly, exactly.

27:34.546 --> 27:36.568
And here you see the interior of the Russian pavilions.

27:37.291 --> 27:40.154
in Chicago in an imperial binding.

27:41.156 --> 27:54.832
Now here, just to offset some of the silver in the binding, here we put a couple of fragmentary pieces just to kind of give it a little... This is original by Alexandra Fjodor, that's a watercolor by her.

27:58.155 --> 28:00.999
And here again, you see work in leisure.

28:01.339 --> 28:07.146
These are all original photographs taken from imperial collections.

28:07.615 --> 28:20.673
This by one of the great photographers, Karielin, showing various exposition shows that took place in the Russian Empire in the 19th century.

28:20.993 --> 28:24.217
Here is one of Tsarevich Alexei's books, Bound in Silk.

28:25.519 --> 28:32.188
When he went to Kostroma with his parents, this was given to him by the Kostroma Zemstvo.

28:34.447 --> 28:42.114
Did you decide in the various categories, culture, war, working leisure, Western perspective?

28:42.134 --> 28:45.597
Was this something that you determined to find?

28:45.617 --> 28:52.322
A lot of the work was done by Professor Ryeth, who will be here tonight, who had the Bakhnechev chair at Columbia.

28:53.143 --> 29:04.453
And all of these books in works of literature, to give some kind of idea of the things that people were reading at the court,

29:04.687 --> 29:13.879
And here, for example, you have some of the great poets of the 19th century, for example, Dead Souls.

29:21.188 --> 29:22.970
One woman wanted to take me home with her.

29:24.792 --> 29:34.204
And you see, Dead Souls in an imperial copy, literature that was read at the court,

29:34.505 --> 29:41.236
Here is a book from an imperial collection documenting the opening of the Imperial Public Library in St.

29:41.276 --> 29:41.857
Petersburg.

29:42.197 --> 29:47.205
This is 1813, at the time of the opening of the Imperial Public Library.

29:47.225 --> 29:48.247
Was it, in fact, a public library?

29:48.487 --> 29:53.155
Well, it was the Imperial Public Library, open to the public as it was then understood.

29:55.419 --> 29:59.145
Because at that particular point, perhaps 80% of the population is not literate.

29:59.205 --> 30:00.006
Right, exactly.

30:04.812 --> 30:10.518
Now here, also... I'm watching.

30:10.698 --> 30:32.980
And here again, you see the culture of the empire, some of the novellas, some of the historical monuments that were found in imperial collections, some of the archaeological digs that were documented at the time and presented to the Russian emperors, and

30:34.141 --> 30:41.473
some more historical watercolors by Sonsif.

30:42.214 --> 30:49.887
Now here... How many of these exhibition cases do you have?

30:50.748 --> 30:55.856
There are 10, actually 12 with two cases.

30:56.017 --> 30:57.499
Right, right.

30:58.643 --> 31:04.190
And here you see a fraction of the books from imperial libraries that deal with issues of faith.

31:04.571 --> 31:14.263
Some of the great monasteries, some of the great churches of the empire, and a fraction of our collection from the Bates Pantyuchov collection of enamels.

31:14.624 --> 31:16.045
This has never been shown before.

31:16.626 --> 31:19.690
These enamels were done in Rastov, one of the

31:20.277 --> 31:24.843
important cities, medieval cities of the empire.

31:25.303 --> 31:36.777
And here, you can see again, in velvet, in velour, these photographs of the Crimea, exquisitely documented for the imperial family, documentation on one of these monsters.

31:36.797 --> 31:41.944
Now, in the library, are these items that you would have acquired, or would they have been presented to you?

31:42.565 --> 31:47.250
No, this was a collection that was given to us, the Bates-Pantyukhov collection.

31:47.591 --> 31:48.512
So, explain

31:48.813 --> 31:53.159
Why it's in the best interest of the library to get things like this?

31:53.379 --> 31:56.263
It's part of a larger convoy of material.

31:56.323 --> 32:01.010
In other words, his collection was primarily books and graphics, but this came along with it.

32:01.050 --> 32:04.775
I insisted that everything come, because that was in his mind.

32:04.795 --> 32:11.344
He was in a private home as part of the collection, as he conceived it, and I wanted to keep it intact.

32:11.364 --> 32:14.128
He wanted to maintain the integrity of the collection as he conceived it.

32:14.648 --> 32:25.013
remarkable photographs of the Volan Monastery, which during Soviet times was turned into a submarine base because it's, of course, on a number of islands in Lake Ladoga.

32:25.516 --> 32:35.555
And here, the New Jerusalem Monastery, this is the model of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

32:36.137 --> 32:45.735
And this is another theme that comes up, how the Russian imperial elite saw themselves as successors to Rome and to Jerusalem.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.838
It's called the New Jerusalem Monastery.

32:47.878 --> 32:50.181
Moscow is to become the New Jerusalem.

32:50.542 --> 32:56.971
And it emulates exactly, in its proportions, the city of the sacred city of Jerusalem.

32:57.712 --> 33:01.357
And here, the same theme comes up again.

33:01.397 --> 33:15.537
Here is a book bound in olive wood that was presented to the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, who was patron of the Imperial Palestine Society because the Russians had a mission in Palestine.

33:16.192 --> 33:25.746
And the book is bound in olive wood from the Mount of Olives and depicted here is the caravansary that the Russian-Palestine society maintained.

33:25.786 --> 33:36.041
It's now the prison in Jerusalem where the Israelis keep people who are disturbing peace.

33:36.061 --> 33:39.246
This is also from the Bates Pantyukhov collection.

33:39.665 --> 33:47.996
One of the many icons, this of the Virgin Mary, the burning bush, which burns, but which is not consumed.

33:48.457 --> 33:55.165
Here again, magnificent from the Library of the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, a description of a collection of enamels.

33:55.306 --> 33:56.647
One of the most beautiful books.

33:56.888 --> 34:05.419
There's another copy of the book, not this specific provenance, in Ambassador Davies's collection at University of Wisconsin.

34:05.399 --> 34:13.567
Is this collection preserving apart a slice of this history that would have disappeared if these materials hadn't come out?

34:14.208 --> 34:22.196
It may be stretching it a little bit, but it certainly highlights certain interests and preoccupations of the imperial court.

34:22.236 --> 34:31.626
For example, here, we could not show the most graphic plates in this book, which was presented to Alexander II, and the book deals with male and female castration.

34:31.876 --> 34:36.423
And here are the implements of castration.

34:37.064 --> 34:44.014
And the reason, of course, this is a Protestant sect, the Scopzi.

34:44.034 --> 34:47.500
And they, of course, were resisting military service.

34:48.421 --> 34:53.910
And this had to be brought to the intention of the emperor because it had all sorts of security.

34:56.213 --> 34:58.557
Exactly.

34:59.798 --> 35:00.820
They're very graphic.

35:03.044 --> 35:14.841
Now, here we come to the two pendants in the exhibit, sellers, salesmen, and buyers.

35:14.861 --> 35:15.842
We call them the pendants.

35:16.804 --> 35:21.851
They're pendants in the sense that they're the core we've gone through.

35:21.871 --> 35:25.997
And now we come to the kind of explicatory or explanatory.

35:26.281 --> 35:29.145
The question arises, you're looking at the sale, well, how did it come here?

35:29.405 --> 35:30.366
And here's the answer.

35:30.987 --> 35:43.322
That it was part of a much larger process of the sale of treasures during that period, whether it's diamonds, and here we have the original catalog of 1925, Ministry of Finance.

35:43.923 --> 35:45.625
This is what was up for sale.

35:45.645 --> 35:47.066
Do we know what we paid for this?

35:48.668 --> 35:49.149
Not really.

35:49.529 --> 35:51.071
The documentation is very skimpy.

35:52.153 --> 35:53.675
And I'll deal with it.

35:53.695 --> 35:55.697
But here's the original letter of invitation from

35:56.065 --> 35:59.169
the Ministry of Education to the New York Public Library.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.672
They may actually initiate this.

36:01.692 --> 36:02.853
Right.

36:02.873 --> 36:04.235
It's to Dr. E.H.

36:04.435 --> 36:05.937
Anderson Public Library.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.018
It says, please come.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.240
Bye.

36:10.423 --> 36:13.426
It's October 29, 19, is that 24?

36:14.728 --> 36:15.289
That's 33.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.471
October 12, 1923.

36:17.632 --> 36:20.956
Is this in the catalog?

36:21.156 --> 36:21.937
Yes.

36:21.977 --> 36:22.738
74 years.

36:23.258 --> 36:23.979
Don't.

36:24.039 --> 36:24.520
Don't read.

36:24.837 --> 36:27.620
And this again shows you how the books migrated.

36:28.001 --> 36:38.813
Here, the book was originally in Tsarskoe Sela, then it went to the reference library of the Hammer galleries, and then it was sold to the New York Public Library.

36:39.173 --> 36:42.657
So you have the whole cycle complete with all of the stamps.

36:43.718 --> 36:50.125
Does this collection have such depth and sophistication that you would see as absolutely research depth?

36:50.306 --> 36:54.270
I mean, there are monographs and books and all sorts of things waiting to be

36:54.436 --> 37:09.818
I think that certainly it is a very significant collection, that there are things from this collection that should be reproduced, reprinted, and researched further.

37:10.640 --> 37:19.212
And here we have some of the cast of characters, Dr. Hammer, his gallery, some of the original auction catalogs,

37:19.546 --> 37:26.852
from that period, Israel Pearlstein, the all-time king of the antiquarian book trade, interiors of galleries.

37:27.793 --> 37:41.966
And here, some of the personalities also in the library world that were responsible for buying Romano treasures, Archibald Carey Coolidge, Paul M. Fekula, Frank Alfred Golder.

37:42.426 --> 37:43.727
Look at that photograph.

37:43.747 --> 37:44.828
Describe that photograph.

37:44.928 --> 37:47.991
It's a remarkable photograph because it shows how books were sold.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.452
There is Golder.

37:50.039 --> 37:53.065
positioned against stacks of material.

37:53.426 --> 38:03.265
And here is the original visa with which Harry traveled to Russia on his famous book-buying trip with Avram Yarmolinsky in 1923.

38:04.067 --> 38:11.361
Case DeWitt Metcalfe, deputy director of the New York Public Library, who has a privilege to meet as a beginning librarian at Harvard.

38:11.381 --> 38:12.503
He was in his 90s.

38:13.276 --> 38:14.238
The Davies is.

38:14.719 --> 38:17.384
Marjorie Merriweather Post, Ambassador Davies.

38:17.404 --> 38:18.526
These are the big names.

38:18.546 --> 38:18.766
Right.

38:19.087 --> 38:22.453
These are the books that were removed from the palace libraries?

38:22.794 --> 38:24.597
These are nationalized books in general.

38:24.658 --> 38:28.024
Fekula was a great purchaser of Imperial Association books.

38:28.124 --> 38:31.330
So these are being readied for shipment?

38:31.631 --> 38:32.472
They're sale.

38:32.773 --> 38:33.394
Right.

38:33.374 --> 38:39.201
And here, for example, you just get some idea, again, of the kind of books.

38:39.221 --> 38:44.247
This is the Coronation Album, from the Coronation Album, of Alexander II.

38:44.668 --> 38:48.172
And what you see here is in that photograph on the table.

38:48.572 --> 38:52.337
So again, there are many things that kind of echo throughout the exhibit.

38:52.357 --> 38:54.259
This is one of the largest books ever printed.

38:54.940 --> 38:55.982
It's just huge.

38:56.382 --> 38:57.383
This is just one plate.

38:58.264 --> 39:02.149
And then we come to the end of our excursion.

39:02.821 --> 39:10.488
And we look at how the Romanos were perceived in some of our very rarest Western European books.

39:10.908 --> 39:21.398
And here, for example, original sketches by an Englishman of the great battle at Balaclava during the Crimean War.

39:22.199 --> 39:32.608
Each one of these books, for example, Gagarin's plates of the Caucasus, or, for example, Hubigong,

39:32.926 --> 39:38.211
the French artist, the morals and costumes of Roshron.

39:38.231 --> 39:45.097
Or for example... Yes, Chromo lithographs, by one of the great artists, Gagarin.

39:45.117 --> 40:00.672
And here, books published in northern Italy, in Venice, in Turin, documenting the visits of Paul,

40:00.989 --> 40:16.525
and Maria Fyodorovna to Venice, to Turin later in the century, and here again, another Western view by Kadil of the center of the Kremlin.

40:16.545 --> 40:29.258
Now, finally, we wanted to show how the material, we come back to,

40:29.457 --> 40:43.028
the visits of the Grand Dukes and these remarkable lithographs of Japan, of Osaka, of the tsunami, of the court, and then these two items, which

40:43.801 --> 40:44.922
are from our collection.

40:45.022 --> 40:49.967
We have a whole collection of imperial chartists signed by Nicholas with all of his titles.

40:51.649 --> 40:59.437
He was Tsar, Moskovsky, Kievsky, Vladinevsky, Novgorodsky, Kazansky, Astrakhansky, and so on.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.478
These are just the titles.

41:01.279 --> 41:06.944
And then here, again, an imperial rescript given to someone for meritorious service in the empire.

41:07.685 --> 41:12.390
This is the actual seal itself in

41:12.758 --> 41:14.541
We should open it up because it's intact.

41:15.823 --> 41:26.899
Now here, we have a genealogical table of the people represented in the exhibit.

41:29.002 --> 41:30.785
And here, a map.

41:33.228 --> 41:35.331
Right, yeah.

41:35.832 --> 41:39.577
Right, tercentenary, which was celebrated in 1913.

41:40.078 --> 41:40.639
And here,

41:43.471 --> 41:57.907
We have a map that is related to this case of Western perspectives in German, dealing with the length and breadth of the empire, from the Elba to Alaska and California and the Hawaiian Islands.

41:58.208 --> 42:01.592
This is Cherka, 1836, the apogee of empire.

42:01.852 --> 42:08.519
And we very selectively put in the cities that are represented in the existence, so people could get some basic orientation.

42:11.182 --> 42:11.323
Okay?

42:11.443 --> 42:11.723
Remarkable.

42:15.972 --> 42:18.415
is the freebie that everyone can take.

42:19.255 --> 42:20.096
So I'll take them as well.

42:20.116 --> 42:20.417
Right.

42:21.217 --> 42:22.639
That was sponsored by the state.

42:23.159 --> 42:25.782
And here, a little press release.

42:26.663 --> 42:29.045
And here, these catalogs, you will get one.

42:29.206 --> 42:31.348
And this is comprehensive.

42:33.270 --> 42:39.817
Portrays many of the images in the... And I hope that we can get a reproduction of the book plate.

42:39.837 --> 42:39.917
Yep.

42:39.937 --> 42:43.400
Because we're definitely going to... Okay, fine.

42:44.862 --> 42:45.102
Wow.

42:46.128 --> 42:46.655
I was insane.
