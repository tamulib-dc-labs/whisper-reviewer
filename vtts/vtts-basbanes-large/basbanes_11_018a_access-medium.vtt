WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:09.053
I wonder if you could just identify yourselves for my tape, and then that'll help me.

00:09.874 --> 00:11.696
You can just leave it here, it'll be fine.

00:13.659 --> 00:14.079
Okay.

00:14.099 --> 00:16.722
That's good, yeah.

00:16.742 --> 00:21.849
Aoki Erdansson, Director of Noby Library, Swedish Academy, Stockholm.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.651
Excellent, thank you.

00:24.052 --> 00:29.278
And I'm Susanne Borenberg, I'm Systems Librarian at this library too.

00:29.377 --> 00:33.060
Do you have cards that will help me with the spellings of your names?

00:33.080 --> 00:33.981
I don't have a card.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.624
My name is Lisa.

00:37.644 --> 00:38.565
How do you spell your name?

00:39.046 --> 00:39.706
Susanne.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.390
That's S-U-S-A-N-N-E.

00:43.610 --> 00:44.010
Okay.

00:44.090 --> 00:44.691
Oh, thank you, sir.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.433
And B-O.

00:47.754 --> 00:48.775
B as in victory.

00:48.795 --> 00:51.497
No, B as in B. It's in my name.

00:51.517 --> 00:52.618
Okay.

00:53.379 --> 00:54.780
O-R-E-N.

00:55.501 --> 00:56.241
That's right.

00:56.361 --> 00:57.142
And then Berg.

00:58.904 --> 00:59.164
B-E-R-E-N.

00:59.853 --> 01:01.095
Good.

01:01.115 --> 01:20.425
Well, we're in the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy, and you were saying that your mandate is to, as we read in this prefatory page of this body, is to promote excellence in... How does the library attempt to do that, shall we ask?

01:22.028 --> 01:28.037
Today we tried to cover the literature from the whole world with

01:29.401 --> 01:31.324
which is an impossible mission.

01:32.586 --> 01:34.088
But we tried to.

01:34.108 --> 01:53.777
We have specialists in English language, French language, Spanish, slave, Spanish, slave.

01:53.797 --> 01:57.282
And we have also, for example,

01:57.818 --> 02:01.024
members of the academy specialized in different languages.

02:01.064 --> 02:12.404
We have eminent specialists in the Chinese, senior, senior analog, member of the academy.

02:14.047 --> 02:19.557
But we can't cover, we can't cover.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.502
all languages here.

02:21.923 --> 02:24.587
But it is largely literature, of course.

02:24.607 --> 02:25.468
Yes, yes.

02:25.488 --> 02:25.889
Fiction.

02:26.089 --> 02:27.911
That's fiction.

02:28.072 --> 02:29.934
And poetry as well?

02:30.155 --> 02:31.437
Drama, poetry.

02:32.058 --> 02:33.980
The creative literature.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.945
All literature around the letter.

02:37.285 --> 02:39.088
Okay, and criticism as well?

02:39.388 --> 02:40.790
Yes, yes.

02:40.810 --> 02:41.511
Of course.

02:41.692 --> 02:48.522
And then how many volumes would you... We always said we have more than 200,000 volumes.

02:49.022 --> 02:49.543
And it is

02:49.743 --> 02:51.125
specifically 20th century?

02:51.425 --> 02:51.746
Yes.

02:53.408 --> 02:58.855
The library was created in 1901.

02:59.396 --> 03:04.642
So you really quite literally encompass the 20th century.

03:04.843 --> 03:05.163
Yes.

03:05.584 --> 03:08.327
But we have also the classics.

03:08.828 --> 03:12.212
That's not our task.

03:12.793 --> 03:17.539
We're not the same task mission as the National Library.

03:17.941 --> 03:20.083
So how would you distinguish the two then?

03:20.323 --> 03:24.767
How would you distinguish your mission from theirs?

03:26.469 --> 03:38.020
We had to, we tried to acquire books where there was interest for the academy.

03:39.201 --> 03:46.007
That is to say the literature which is created today.

03:47.827 --> 03:52.271
We buy literature or fiction from now living authors.

03:52.291 --> 03:58.177
And if dead authors, if they come with some new edition, we don't really care.

03:59.178 --> 04:03.482
If it's not a very important or interesting translation.

04:03.502 --> 04:09.007
So to say, if they have Shakespeare in a new edition, it's not necessarily that we buy it.

04:09.488 --> 04:17.175
But if it's a good translation, a new translation, a different translation, and a now living translator, then we might buy it.

04:17.408 --> 04:25.958
So, Pasternak's trans-Russian translation of Shakespeare, which was regarded as excellent, is likely to be in your collection here.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.722
Yeah, but Pasternak is... Pasternak is short, right?

04:28.782 --> 04:29.042
Yes.

04:29.062 --> 04:29.823
That's what I'm saying.

04:29.843 --> 04:31.125
Yes, right.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.007
But I think that's what you're saying.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.911
You would have that because it's Pasternak.

04:36.091 --> 04:37.412
Yes, yes.

04:37.593 --> 04:44.401
But we don't necessarily find new editions of dead authors, so to say.

04:44.461 --> 04:45.222
They have to be.

04:45.505 --> 05:15.445
alive and why and that's this is absolutely fascinating to me why is the living author of primary interest if you think of our history this is an institute one of the reasons we we are an institute for the swedish academy to to nominee the nominate the prize winner of the nobel prize and the authors of the nobel prize they have to be living it has to be living authors right

05:15.779 --> 05:17.360
You can't get the price when you're dead.

05:18.702 --> 05:26.269
Has it ever happened that somebody who has been seriously considered died, you know?

05:26.329 --> 05:29.091
Well, they die all the time.

05:29.131 --> 05:30.552
They die all the time, aren't they?

05:30.733 --> 05:34.916
But I guess that immediately takes them out of the running, so to speak.

05:35.417 --> 05:35.877
It is.

05:36.598 --> 05:43.204
Not necessarily, but I mean, that's our main... It is to recognize excellence

05:43.606 --> 06:12.837
by living writers excellence in literature in literature by living and the academy distributed about 50 prizes not only the great prize there are other prizes in poetry Swedish poets drama teachers and so on translators about 50

06:13.407 --> 06:14.308
Every year.

06:14.348 --> 06:17.312
Explain to me why prizes are important.

06:18.573 --> 06:26.523
Does it validate the work or does the work validate itself?

06:26.723 --> 06:33.351
The Swedish Academy has two missions.

06:33.371 --> 06:35.874
One, the Swedish language.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.216
The other is the Swedish literature.

06:40.499 --> 06:41.220
And that's why.

06:42.837 --> 06:51.107
Now, when you talk about collecting 20th century literature, and as you already acknowledged, it's an impossible task to cover the whole world.

06:51.287 --> 06:52.689
Yeah.

06:52.709 --> 06:56.774
So how do you separate the wheat from the chaff, as we say?

06:58.035 --> 07:00.058
Yeah.

07:00.418 --> 07:02.901
Now we are talking about the noble processes.

07:02.941 --> 07:03.342
Sure.

07:03.382 --> 07:03.662
Yes.

07:07.326 --> 07:12.793
In a week, we send off 600 letters for the next year.

07:12.993 --> 07:41.633
to foreign academies, recognized by the Swedish Academy, lawyers in literature, who are an ally, and presidents of pen clubs, presidents of pen clubs in the whole world, professors,

07:42.119 --> 07:46.025
in language and literature all over the world.

07:47.847 --> 07:57.561
And in return, they propose a candidate.

07:57.581 --> 08:02.829
And at the end of January, it's finished.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.191
At the end of January.

08:04.291 --> 08:04.972
January.

08:05.453 --> 08:09.919
And after that, there is a committee, the Nobel Committee.

08:09.939 --> 08:11.822
Five members of the Swedish Academy

08:13.287 --> 08:25.458
who look, discuss all these candidates in collaboration with Swedish Academy, the other members.

08:25.478 --> 08:33.966
And at the end of May, there is a short list.

08:34.887 --> 08:36.128
Only five candidates.

08:37.590 --> 08:39.712
And that is not publicized?

08:39.732 --> 08:41.033
No, no, no, no.

08:41.536 --> 08:42.217
Never.

08:42.237 --> 08:45.182
But it certainly does arouse intense speculation.

08:45.342 --> 08:45.522
Yes.

08:47.185 --> 09:01.887
And while first in October, while first in October, the academy, the department secretary, made the announcement.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.610
And as it happened was yesterday.

09:03.790 --> 09:06.835
Yes.

09:07.574 --> 09:11.199
There's always intense anxiety and enthusiasm.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.542
I'm sure that there are certain groups that have favorites.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.965
Yes, very often.

09:16.245 --> 09:20.490
But I think it is a real special.

09:21.311 --> 09:30.443
Because Daryl Froeh will know that everybody

09:31.486 --> 09:38.132
Everybody who is occupied with theatre literature knows Dario Faux.

09:39.033 --> 09:45.439
Which was not the case with Szymborska or Szymseni.

09:47.982 --> 09:50.865
So this was a very popular selection, you would say?

09:50.885 --> 09:53.347
I think, yes, in a double sense.

09:53.707 --> 09:54.148
Popular.

09:55.389 --> 09:59.653
And how is that greeted by the people of Sweden, by the way?

10:00.055 --> 10:03.399
I think the reaction was very favorable.

10:03.459 --> 10:16.716
And in general, because this is my first visit to this beautiful country, because I'm also interested in this whole concept of book culture, is this something that the people take a great deal of interest in, what you say?

10:16.756 --> 10:25.827
Yes, in the Nobel Prize of Literature, yes.

10:26.488 --> 10:29.151
I think it's more spectacular than that.

10:29.907 --> 10:34.614
the price in physics or chemistry.

10:35.455 --> 10:36.237
More so?

10:36.597 --> 10:37.158
Yeah, more.

10:37.418 --> 10:49.797
Because this is a country... Because everybody can, in some way or another, understand the price.

10:50.318 --> 10:58.530
In chemistry, in physics, it's very difficult for everybody to...

10:59.860 --> 11:01.181
know what it's about.

11:04.585 --> 11:05.426
You can read the book.

11:05.686 --> 11:13.274
You can understand an equation that may find a cure for age.

11:13.354 --> 11:23.525
And often and always there is only one person in literature.

11:25.207 --> 11:28.230
In physics there are many

11:28.683 --> 11:55.821
professors there are institutes medicine but also people read books yeah and is is sweden the country of the book in your view i i think it's rather finland yes all right yeah i'm sorry all right iceland finland and iceland in the nautica countries i

11:56.476 --> 12:04.569
I know that in Finland they read more than in Sweden.

12:04.589 --> 12:05.430
Why do you think that is?

12:07.313 --> 12:08.876
Tradition.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.416
I don't know.

12:10.218 --> 12:12.381
Well, you see, we're concerned.

12:12.642 --> 12:17.369
People ask me if I'm writing about the demise of the book as an object.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.012
What do I know?

12:19.552 --> 12:22.297
But I am certainly going to libraries.

12:22.858 --> 12:24.340
I was just in Leipzig with her.

12:24.944 --> 12:28.949
They lead the world in the preservation of books on a mass scale.

12:28.969 --> 12:32.834
I'm interested in that, but I'm also interested in digital books and standard books.

12:32.854 --> 12:39.402
But what really concerns me is not so much the book as the object, because I do believe how I'll survive, is the people reading.

12:39.602 --> 12:53.820
And in my country, unfortunately, we have too many things that compete with books, and you really don't find... I was flying to Texas, to San Francisco through Texas, and there was a man sitting next to me reading Cicero.

12:54.475 --> 12:56.598
And I was so stunned.

12:56.918 --> 13:02.246
And I said, excuse me, sir, if you don't mind, are you reading this for business or for pleasure?

13:02.266 --> 13:04.069
I thought he was a professor.

13:04.109 --> 13:04.830
He said, for pleasure.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.111
And I wrote it down.

13:06.192 --> 13:10.878
I mean, I was so amazed to see somebody reading a classic work in public.

13:10.978 --> 13:12.761
How often do you see that?

13:13.542 --> 13:19.390
But I think there are traditions in history in Sweden that make people a real people.

13:19.410 --> 13:23.436
We've got these traditions of public libraries

13:23.753 --> 13:27.136
What do you call it?

13:27.176 --> 13:28.077
Folketskolen.

13:28.097 --> 13:28.878
Yeah, Folketskolen.

13:28.918 --> 13:30.480
What do you call it?

13:30.900 --> 13:35.264
Education for grown-ups.

13:35.364 --> 13:37.186
Adult education.

13:39.048 --> 13:41.491
That's built around reading, reading books.

13:41.591 --> 13:43.152
That's very important.

13:43.172 --> 13:51.060
If you read books, you get to learn things and then you can pull back out, you see.

13:51.428 --> 13:54.913
have an impact on your life and on your surroundings.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.656
I think that's a tradition we've got.

13:57.136 --> 14:03.306
To go back just a bit, when you get these nominations, and I won't take up too much of your tenure.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.367
Excuse me.

14:04.407 --> 14:05.268
No, that's fine.

14:05.308 --> 14:08.173
Really, this is a treat for me.

14:08.313 --> 14:09.034
It's very useful.

14:09.455 --> 14:12.419
Trust me, you'll see very good results out of this.

14:14.322 --> 14:19.950
You mentioned that the 600 or so people you request to

14:20.183 --> 14:21.765
make suggestions and nominations.

14:22.225 --> 14:24.488
Do you then acquire the books of all these authors?

14:27.010 --> 14:27.991
Not all, not all.

14:28.072 --> 14:30.855
But what's the process at that point?

14:30.875 --> 14:31.715
Yes, yes.

14:31.735 --> 14:35.720
The candidates are very, they are very important for us.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.703
We, in general, we have their books here.

14:39.484 --> 14:40.225
So you already do?

14:40.245 --> 14:40.745
Yes, yes.

14:40.965 --> 14:45.050
That's one source of our, of our acquisition.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.013
But there are other sources.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.586
For example, reviews, magazines.

14:52.969 --> 14:59.518
I think we have a good choice of magazines, literature magazines.

14:59.538 --> 15:11.574
So you have a staff that is constantly reading reviews and criticism around the world and basically saying, oh, this looks like an important writer.

15:11.734 --> 15:12.716
Oh, it's got that book.

15:12.796 --> 15:14.558
Does that handle what happens?

15:15.365 --> 15:43.785
and also the candidates proposed by those who are authorized to propose and the members of the academy and authors and translators there are quite a few people and here we have also about 50 or 100 scholars who come here and

15:44.440 --> 15:46.202
everything is freer.

15:46.943 --> 15:55.515
But we ask them to propose interesting writers in their field.

15:56.676 --> 16:00.341
And how many books a year would you estimate you acquire?

16:00.401 --> 16:01.403
Not very much.

16:01.463 --> 16:03.265
About 3,000.

16:03.626 --> 16:06.910
So it is very exclusive.

16:08.072 --> 16:09.654
The best of the best.

16:10.054 --> 16:12.878
So you really are not attempting in any way to be

16:13.448 --> 16:15.070
a comprehensive collection.

16:15.750 --> 16:15.991
No.

16:17.172 --> 16:18.033
But an exclusive.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.735
Yes, very, very exclusive.

16:20.255 --> 16:27.643
But one that is also not necessarily comprehensive in terms of titles, but it covers the world.

16:28.284 --> 16:29.585
We do... We try to.

16:29.605 --> 16:30.566
We try to.

16:30.806 --> 16:38.835
And how many nations, would you say, have literature that's represented in your collection?

16:38.855 --> 16:41.818
I'm asking some silly questions.

16:42.338 --> 16:45.663
Probably as many nations as there are in that.

16:45.683 --> 16:55.577
Well, when the library was built up for almost 100 years, it was said to cover 33 languages.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.739
33.

16:58.061 --> 16:58.762
Enumerated.

17:00.244 --> 17:04.390
But today I think we cover about double.

17:04.410 --> 17:07.755
Not cover, but we try to.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.219
How many...

17:10.418 --> 17:15.528
nations have received Nobel Prizes in Literature, I wonder.

17:16.028 --> 17:16.449
Do you know?

17:17.331 --> 17:17.551
No.

17:18.052 --> 17:19.415
I can figure it out.

17:19.595 --> 17:22.420
I'll give you a list of them.

17:22.481 --> 17:24.785
I have a list, by the way, of winners.

17:25.306 --> 17:28.211
You have a list of laureates.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.359
Excellent.

17:33.723 --> 17:58.549
I won't take up too much of your time I think I think it's easier for you to grasp to understand what we do here when you are going around you find a very very concrete way you talk about the whole concept of folk culture

17:58.833 --> 18:03.778
I think that we are really sitting at the seat of what could be described as the epitome of folk culture.

18:04.679 --> 18:10.825
I think you have been interested in Borges, I think.

18:10.865 --> 18:11.525
Of course.

18:11.545 --> 18:15.089
And everybody asks, why didn't he, why didn't he got the prize?

18:15.169 --> 18:15.809
Good question.

18:16.710 --> 18:17.611
Do you have anything?

18:18.392 --> 18:19.773
I can, no.

18:20.134 --> 18:26.260
You see, our archives are secret for 50 years here.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.722
But you can, you can,

18:29.613 --> 18:33.943
guess the candidates by looking in our catalogue.

18:33.963 --> 18:41.058
And if you look at the name of Borges in our catalogue, you'll find something.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.461
I'd like to do that.

18:43.404 --> 18:45.428
I'd be interested in Kazantzakis

18:46.066 --> 19:03.085
So United is playing the record.

19:05.248 --> 19:05.528
Two.

19:06.910 --> 19:07.470
Take two.

19:08.391 --> 19:10.774
Go back.

19:10.923 --> 19:22.236
So the records are made public after 50 years.

19:22.837 --> 19:28.203
They're not made public, but they're no longer... Yes, for scholars.

19:31.327 --> 19:33.069
They're released for examination.

19:33.149 --> 19:38.415
You see, one to six of... 103.

19:38.716 --> 19:41.239
There are 103 records, right?

19:44.802 --> 19:46.364
So what does that indicate?

19:46.944 --> 19:53.671
That's... It's up to you to interpret that.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.313
But this is more than books.

19:55.353 --> 20:05.803
This means that these are... So there are 103...

20:08.517 --> 20:12.442
Is this a catalogue of your records?

20:12.842 --> 20:14.384
Here in our library, yes.

20:14.404 --> 20:16.066
Of the archives?

20:16.086 --> 20:16.727
No.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.369
Books in the library.

20:18.449 --> 20:21.753
Books in the library, a book of Borges.

20:22.995 --> 20:28.542
So that there are so many indicates that he has been.

20:28.862 --> 20:29.603
He has been.

20:29.983 --> 20:32.146
How about Nikos Kazantzakis?

20:34.109 --> 20:36.972
I know when Camus won the prize.

20:37.205 --> 20:39.468
He said K-A-Z.

20:41.452 --> 20:47.100
Can I type it?

20:47.120 --> 20:47.601
Yes.

20:53.390 --> 20:54.311
52 items.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.877
So Kazanzaki's generated 52 items.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.681
Would you consider that a lot?

21:01.268 --> 21:03.431
Yes.

21:03.752 --> 21:07.678
These are the different languages that it's in.

21:07.718 --> 21:11.904
So it's in Spanish, it's in English, it's in German, it's in Greek.

21:11.924 --> 21:12.666
Yes.

21:13.126 --> 21:19.917
If the member of the Academy can't read the language in question, we have a translation.

21:19.937 --> 21:22.561
English, French, German, Spanish.

21:24.003 --> 21:25.886
You see our friend Kazinzakis had 52.

21:25.926 --> 21:29.892
52 entries, which I think is considerable, right?

21:30.108 --> 21:31.069
Can I try one more?

21:31.389 --> 21:34.232
He's Greek, yes.

21:34.252 --> 21:48.846
97, so he was there.

21:50.087 --> 21:57.094
And this also indicates the years that, that doesn't really indicate the years that he might have been discussed, just the years

21:57.378 --> 22:04.027
Okay, so that's Graham Greene is 97, Kazantzakis.

22:04.869 --> 22:08.854
Yeah, why not?

22:09.816 --> 22:10.396
Oh, I have another.

22:10.657 --> 22:11.318
Can I try another?

22:11.358 --> 22:15.283
The interpretation is yours.

22:16.004 --> 22:18.047
I'm not making any interpretation at all.

22:18.368 --> 22:22.153
How do I go back to search again?

22:22.420 --> 22:34.741
Search, okay, so I'm going to do... No toaster, because you don't spell it really.

22:34.981 --> 22:40.410
Ah, try it again.

22:40.551 --> 22:44.177
How do I do this now?

22:44.637 --> 22:47.382
Okay.

22:48.442 --> 23:11.125
okay yes t-o-l-s-t-o-y maybe like that you think just three

23:11.307 --> 23:17.478
It's not complete.

23:17.718 --> 23:21.205
So now you've been counting and then I'm telling you it's not complete.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.549
Okay, that's important.

23:24.010 --> 23:29.760
The academy was very interesting at the beginning.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.725
But this is also the very beginning.

23:33.025 --> 23:38.093
So I would imagine you're entering material in the database going back.

23:39.155 --> 23:47.909
At the time, Tulsa was not an ideal writer from now.

23:50.372 --> 23:58.966
This is one of those cases where, of course, a writer's reputation and stature becomes greater in death.

24:00.488 --> 24:00.889
Perhaps.

24:01.223 --> 24:07.351
but the adaptation of the idea has changed too, today.

24:07.431 --> 24:08.372
That's right.

24:08.652 --> 24:15.861
But when you think of your mission, it's as you stated earlier, you're dealing with living ways.

24:15.881 --> 24:31.180
So maybe in this case, history as a judge, you're not... No, when the president was given to the unknown poet, Syl Prudhomme,

24:31.312 --> 24:35.578
the French.

24:36.619 --> 24:50.618
All Swedish writers and foreign writers protested because they said there are Steinberg, Nibsson and Tolstoy.

24:52.401 --> 24:54.624
Steinberg and Nibsson didn't get Nobels either?

24:54.684 --> 24:54.864
No.

24:56.226 --> 24:57.808
I have to check one of them out too.

25:01.147 --> 25:06.073
Ibsen, he wasn't an ideal writer.

25:06.253 --> 25:09.557
Alright, so how do I do this now?

25:09.757 --> 25:10.178
Lane.

25:10.298 --> 25:13.401
Okay, so I'm going to look up Ibsen.

25:13.421 --> 25:16.605
No, no, you take, you go back.

25:17.746 --> 25:18.928
You take five.

25:19.328 --> 25:19.909
Five.

25:20.049 --> 25:22.412
Oh, I see, okay.

25:22.772 --> 25:23.133
Five.

25:23.393 --> 25:25.035
That's 15.

25:25.055 --> 25:28.239
We have the classics.

25:28.259 --> 25:29.921
So I go, just Ibsen, right?

25:30.201 --> 25:31.002
Ibsen, yes.

25:31.218 --> 25:35.745
I don't need his first initial, do you think?

25:35.925 --> 25:36.466
No.

25:36.486 --> 25:42.857
I wouldn't think so.

25:42.877 --> 25:43.638
And 110.

25:44.559 --> 25:46.502
You see him?

25:48.465 --> 25:49.487
That's fascinating.

25:50.589 --> 25:56.398
I think I may as well get Strindberg while I'm at it because Strindberg worked at the library over there.

26:02.521 --> 26:04.203
B-E-R-G, right?

26:04.363 --> 26:08.228
Or is it B-U-R-G?

26:08.908 --> 26:19.521
Is it B-E-R-G or B-U?

26:19.541 --> 26:20.943
Five hundred and eleven.

26:23.445 --> 26:28.191
It's the French would say.

26:28.711 --> 26:37.360
Okay, that's... Indeed.

26:40.404 --> 26:44.408
But if I were to look up somebody like John Updike, I wouldn't see anything, right?

26:44.428 --> 26:44.748
I'm sure.

26:44.788 --> 26:46.890
Oh, but I thought you said 50 years.

26:47.211 --> 26:52.997
Okay.

26:58.681 --> 27:02.667
It's pretty interesting, isn't it?

27:04.771 --> 27:08.577
And these are titles of books that are in here.

27:09.318 --> 27:10.620
And then how do I go back again?

27:12.103 --> 27:12.784
You want to go back?

27:12.804 --> 27:13.986
Yeah, I want to see another one.

27:15.608 --> 27:20.436
Okay.

27:29.680 --> 27:33.184
Oh, Mr. Updike couldn't be pleased to know that.

27:33.244 --> 27:35.987
Joyce Carol Oates is 39 more than he does.

27:37.689 --> 27:38.289
Oh, I've got to try.

27:38.309 --> 27:39.430
This is exciting.

27:41.833 --> 27:42.273
One mother.

27:47.059 --> 27:48.380
Contemporary of Updikes.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.743
Of course, he hasn't written as much.

27:50.763 --> 27:52.524
33, though, is very interesting.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.730
Very, very, very interesting.

27:58.621 --> 27:59.962
Don't ask God.

27:59.982 --> 28:00.463
Here's one.

28:00.483 --> 28:09.433
49, good for Tennessee.

28:09.633 --> 28:13.177
I love Tennessee Williams.

28:13.197 --> 28:15.139
I could do this forever, but that's enough.

28:15.539 --> 28:17.181
Okay.

28:17.201 --> 28:23.228
You can hear that Borges was not alone to the Swedish Academy.

28:23.248 --> 28:27.953
To have a...

28:28.557 --> 28:30.319
Oh, I would love it.

28:36.947 --> 28:43.475
That looks like it's English right there.

28:43.495 --> 28:44.356
And this was yesterday.

28:44.396 --> 28:46.618
Wow.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.741
That's so exciting.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.404
Where is that announcement made?

28:52.025 --> 28:54.408
Usher.

28:55.289 --> 28:56.370
Thank you.

28:56.705 --> 28:58.948
Yes, and who is that?

28:59.428 --> 28:59.989
Homer.

29:00.009 --> 29:00.690
Oh, that's Homer.

29:01.351 --> 29:02.952
One of my ancestors.

29:05.295 --> 29:06.817
I'm Greek-American.

29:07.418 --> 29:12.344
Here's the manuals on modern literature.

29:14.506 --> 29:17.230
Greek, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian.

29:18.531 --> 29:21.835
On his side, bibliographies.

29:22.928 --> 29:35.000
And this room is the reading room where your members, is this where the deliberations are made in this room?

29:36.181 --> 29:38.764
Not only for the members.

29:38.804 --> 29:41.927
There are two rooms for the study.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.211
That room and here, the reading room.

29:45.231 --> 29:50.556
The other rooms are for the staff and for the speech academy.

29:51.127 --> 29:53.691
But where are the winners selected?

29:55.033 --> 29:58.939
Okay, thank you.

29:58.959 --> 30:10.898
I think it depends on people are working on their work.

30:10.918 --> 30:13.302
But we'll do it.

30:13.322 --> 30:17.488
And we come to this table with the latest acquisitions.

30:17.992 --> 30:21.756
Like that, they can see what we have acquired.

30:21.876 --> 30:26.782
I say acquired because we get free copies.

30:26.862 --> 30:27.283
I'm sure.

30:27.303 --> 30:32.048
Are they necessarily entered into the collection?

30:32.168 --> 30:40.318
I'm sure you still screen the books that otherwise you'd have an unmanageable collection.

30:40.338 --> 30:44.442
No, they know very well what books we are interested in.

30:44.462 --> 30:44.823
I see.

30:46.685 --> 30:47.526
Excellent.

30:48.198 --> 30:56.889
Thank you.

30:58.331 --> 31:06.942
And I see, for instance, from A, African-America, African literature today, Australian, Canadian literature.

31:07.462 --> 31:08.063
And German.

31:08.279 --> 31:11.163
And then, of course, contemporary literature.

31:11.183 --> 31:13.345
That's a big... Criticism.

31:13.465 --> 31:22.016
There's Danish literary magazines, books from England, modern poetry and translation, et cetera, et cetera.

31:22.356 --> 31:22.777
French.

31:23.217 --> 31:23.538
French.

31:26.081 --> 31:31.307
And then here we've got... I mean, these are international, too.

31:31.468 --> 31:33.250
Do you know that?

31:33.270 --> 31:33.590
That's right.

31:34.111 --> 31:35.873
And then we've got...

31:36.190 --> 31:42.077
That's not funny.

31:51.709 --> 31:52.210
That's okay.

31:52.230 --> 31:52.810
That's fine.

31:52.830 --> 31:53.131
Yes.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.033
I understand what you're showing me.

31:55.574 --> 31:58.037
Yes, yes.

31:58.057 --> 31:59.398
We've got quite a few magazines.

31:59.438 --> 31:59.939
What was that?

31:59.959 --> 32:03.143
You just, Q-U-I-M-E-R-A, and that is what... Yes, right.

32:04.743 --> 32:10.450
Spanish, I hope it's Spanish.

32:10.570 --> 32:15.316
Partisan review, of course, which is an important text.

32:15.696 --> 32:21.183
And then worship.

32:22.044 --> 32:24.407
Of course.

32:24.587 --> 32:31.535
So this time it's Italian.

32:31.555 --> 32:33.197
The new Russian.

32:34.325 --> 32:41.094
Can I just leave this cane someplace so I can take some notes?

32:41.114 --> 32:42.436
Yes.

32:43.477 --> 32:43.878
Okay.

32:45.580 --> 32:45.920
Okay.

32:47.082 --> 32:50.647
In fact, I'll leave these papers someplace.

32:50.687 --> 32:52.049
That way I can take notes.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.672
The New York Times book review.

32:56.234 --> 32:56.975
Food to a grass.

32:58.257 --> 32:59.338
What does that headline say?

33:01.641 --> 33:02.863
German poets.

33:04.126 --> 33:08.233
But I mean... Did he die?

33:08.673 --> 33:09.835
No.

33:09.855 --> 33:10.176
No.

33:10.897 --> 33:13.662
It's just a story about him.

33:15.024 --> 33:15.204
Okay.

33:15.224 --> 33:17.408
I was concerned that it might be a little bit you already.

33:17.508 --> 33:19.211
Did I make something?

33:20.092 --> 33:24.900
Then again, a bit of the lower record numbers, volume?

33:25.000 --> 33:25.181
Yes.

33:26.443 --> 33:27.585
Of the magazine.

33:27.765 --> 33:28.606
It starts here.

33:29.247 --> 33:30.910
The staff that drew it.

33:31.868 --> 33:37.273
then there's no, we want this, we don't want this.

33:37.293 --> 33:39.656
That's a very important thing.

33:39.716 --> 33:42.038
Make this quickly, ask for this, okay?

33:42.438 --> 33:45.922
And make it as quick as you want, really.

33:47.904 --> 33:50.146
This is... I'm fine, I'm fine.

33:50.306 --> 33:52.788
No, no, it's not because of that.

33:52.808 --> 33:59.715
It's just, I realized that this was not scheduled, so... What I wanted to tell you is that we divide books

34:00.117 --> 34:20.315
by language, which means English-speaking English, which means these books are books from Australia, from some parts of Africa, English.

34:20.716 --> 34:23.658
But if they're in English, this is where they're going to be.

34:24.359 --> 34:27.762
Even if the author is Indian,

34:28.433 --> 34:30.557
But it wasn't English in general.

34:31.499 --> 34:33.062
Exactly, right, exactly.

34:33.202 --> 34:37.029
Somebody like Naipaul, for instance.

34:37.390 --> 34:38.692
Yes, right.

34:38.752 --> 34:39.954
Or Rushdie, perhaps, even.

34:39.974 --> 34:41.337
Yes, yes.

34:41.357 --> 34:43.040
But he's English now, I think.

34:44.002 --> 34:47.809
But I understand precisely what you mean.

34:47.869 --> 34:52.197
Nabokov, for instance, in his time later,

34:52.463 --> 34:55.289
How would you do Nabokov, who wrote in Russian and in English?

34:55.329 --> 34:58.956
Where he started, just like Beckett.

34:59.096 --> 35:06.090
I think he's in, we have him in French, because he mostly wrote in French.

35:06.110 --> 35:07.132
Beckett, yes.

35:07.232 --> 35:09.016
So we put it in French.

35:09.777 --> 35:14.286
I want to look up Nabokov, by the way.

35:14.401 --> 35:25.935
Well, I don't know, but how much he did so much writing in, you know, when he lived in America, in English.

35:25.955 --> 35:32.663
I mean, he's considered an American writer in some... Yes, in America.

35:32.683 --> 35:33.825
Well, he considered himself.

35:34.265 --> 35:39.852
Yes, but like in socialism, I think probably in Russian.

35:40.034 --> 35:44.683
Of course, but he never got American citizenship either.

35:45.284 --> 35:51.636
We looked up now, but then we make a mark in the catalogue that this author is from India.

35:52.638 --> 36:03.358
It looks that we've got all these English authors, but that's because we've got also the Canadian, the Australian, the English.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.255
Do you mind if I take a photograph of this?

36:08.178 --> 36:10.921
Just, and again, it's for visual purposes and nothing else.

36:12.724 --> 36:21.975
Not for reproduction, but just the things you're describing to me are very, you know, a lot easier for me to... To remember.

36:21.995 --> 36:23.838
To remember when I had a picture of it.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.943
And on top of that's done.

36:28.304 --> 36:28.524
Uh-huh.

36:28.544 --> 36:31.708
And that's difficult, too, because you were not only...

36:32.127 --> 36:35.690
That's right.

36:35.811 --> 36:42.397
Well, then you have some Canadians who write in French.

36:44.799 --> 36:45.680
So it's by language.

36:46.861 --> 36:49.544
But when the award is given, it's by nationality, right?

36:50.084 --> 36:50.585
By nation?

36:51.005 --> 36:52.066
It's given by author.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.187
It's given to the author.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.311
So that's a misconception that a nation wins an award?

36:57.351 --> 36:57.611
Yeah.

36:59.113 --> 37:00.514
But even though there is balance,

37:01.220 --> 37:05.947
I think you could almost bet that there will not be an Italian winner next year.

37:06.007 --> 37:06.648
Probably.

37:07.269 --> 37:12.316
But still, you give the price to the author, and that's the kind way over.

37:12.336 --> 37:13.017
It's the author.

37:13.798 --> 37:22.450
I mean, I'm not asking you to discuss Graham Greene, because that's history, but I do remember when they gave William Golding the award, they said, well, that should pretty much take care of the Greene question.

37:23.932 --> 37:25.354
But I mean, they all respect him.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.605
They do, but that's part of the fun of it.

37:28.845 --> 37:31.088
That's part of the fun.

37:34.193 --> 37:35.094
How long have you worked here?

37:38.059 --> 37:38.520
Since 1913.

37:38.540 --> 37:39.421
I don't remember when you were.

37:39.441 --> 37:41.805
That's before your watch, as we used to say in the Navy.

37:42.606 --> 37:43.727
That was not on your watch.

37:44.549 --> 37:46.171
Oh, right.

37:46.592 --> 37:49.136
And then, of course, we've got the business center.

37:49.276 --> 37:54.604
I'm going to turn it out here.

37:54.624 --> 37:55.425
All this business liquor.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.735
History of literature.

37:57.076 --> 37:58.037
Oh, this is exciting.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.662
I'll put away that.

38:02.842 --> 38:05.145
No, no, that's fine.

38:05.585 --> 38:08.548
It's part of the ambiance.

38:08.568 --> 38:11.472
You know, I like to see things in situ, as they say, you know.

38:12.353 --> 38:12.953
That's fine.

38:13.194 --> 38:21.963
Again, this is not for... That's the end of it.

38:22.104 --> 38:23.345
So that'll be the last picture.

38:24.046 --> 38:25.227
Oh, well.

38:25.932 --> 38:40.751
But this is the history of literature, and then we start with Swedish literature, and then it's Swedish literature, and then it's history of English literature.

38:40.771 --> 38:50.804
And it's on fifth floor, as well as the Swedish, English, and French fiction, and the history of French literature, it's on fifth floor.

38:50.824 --> 38:52.927
And there's a reason for it.

38:52.987 --> 38:53.988
That's what's mostly used.

38:54.429 --> 38:55.450
That's what we have to get.

38:57.269 --> 39:21.133
uh the more that's what they usually or most often order for people coming here so we keep them on this floor it's a very pragmatic approach it's a good approach you have to use something for all this

39:24.539 --> 39:33.668
And this.

39:35.850 --> 39:38.012
And it's too late.

39:39.334 --> 39:39.834
But you know what?

39:39.934 --> 39:41.536
I don't think it would come out too good anyway.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.079
And I'm sure we can get photographs of this.

39:52.247 --> 39:54.529
Oh my.

39:54.847 --> 39:57.331
Just tell me, describe for me where we are.

39:57.391 --> 40:11.012
And what time yesterday was the announcement made?

40:11.053 --> 40:17.262
It's 12.20, so almost 24 hours.

40:17.282 --> 40:21.529
24 hours ago at this time, I'm sure that people were beginning to assemble in here.

40:21.830 --> 40:25.414
Who does?

40:29.437 --> 40:29.718
Yes.

40:29.778 --> 40:50.318
And television cameras and everything.

40:50.753 --> 40:52.915
Quite a few people.

40:54.517 --> 40:58.641
Often it's, you know, you can hardly open the door.

40:58.661 --> 40:58.881
Yeah.

40:59.842 --> 41:01.243
And are you here when that happens?

41:01.263 --> 41:02.845
Yes, it's fun.

41:02.865 --> 41:03.145
Yeah.

41:03.305 --> 41:04.786
Oh, yeah.

41:04.806 --> 41:05.487
Of course, yeah.

41:07.429 --> 41:10.492
And was it a surprise to you up until the minute it was announced?

41:10.512 --> 41:12.494
Yes, it's always a surprise.

41:12.514 --> 41:14.796
We don't just remember.

41:14.816 --> 41:17.098
So do you have guesses amongst yourselves?

41:18.740 --> 41:19.140
It doesn't.

41:19.897 --> 41:20.798
Oh, come on!

41:21.139 --> 41:28.248
You're not supposed to know.

41:28.268 --> 41:30.131
Then you choose not to know, right?

41:30.772 --> 41:33.275
Then you can wonder and be curious.

41:33.596 --> 41:39.323
But in a way, you kind of, you know.

41:39.343 --> 41:41.186
Do you read a lot of these authors yourself?

41:43.008 --> 41:43.269
Sometimes.

41:43.309 --> 41:46.393
So do you have a personal favorite that you'd like to see?

41:47.622 --> 41:49.865
for either sentimental reasons or literary reasons?

41:50.286 --> 41:51.488
No, I don't think so.

41:51.508 --> 41:56.616
Because you forced yourself not to, it's important.

41:56.636 --> 41:57.417
I don't know.

41:57.437 --> 41:58.058
I know, I know.

41:58.899 --> 42:00.241
This is really wonderful.

42:01.022 --> 42:01.743
This is exciting.

42:02.164 --> 42:12.279
This is also the room where the laureate, the Nobel Prize winner, holds his Nobel speech.

42:12.299 --> 42:16.245
That's often in the seventh or eighth of December.

42:16.782 --> 42:19.585
Of every Nobel laureate or just the literary one?

42:19.605 --> 42:20.206
The literary one.

42:20.646 --> 42:21.507
Literary one.

42:22.248 --> 42:22.508
Okay.

42:22.528 --> 42:25.050
The literary laureate.

42:25.070 --> 42:26.332
The literary laureate.

42:29.955 --> 42:39.205
And that will be in December.

42:39.485 --> 42:44.190
It will be in December.

42:44.677 --> 42:47.782
So they got like a weed that's very hectic.

42:49.344 --> 42:52.950
So is today kind of anti-climactic?

42:52.970 --> 42:54.152
Is it quiet now?

42:55.173 --> 43:02.084
The papers were wonderful.

43:02.985 --> 43:09.435
It's great.

43:10.478 --> 43:12.200
Oh, that'd be good.

43:12.781 --> 43:14.603
And that'll be pretty much it, by the way.

43:14.643 --> 43:19.068
You know, after that, I don't... You want to see another picture?

43:19.829 --> 43:20.950
That's the third.

43:20.970 --> 43:22.933
He was the founder of the Jewish Academy.

43:22.953 --> 43:23.974
You have to remember that.

43:23.994 --> 43:32.804
Gustav III, a statue of him behind podium, founder SA.

43:32.824 --> 43:35.828
Thank you.

43:37.478 --> 43:52.617
And this is... 18 chairs.

43:53.318 --> 44:02.389
There is a beautiful box.

44:03.162 --> 44:09.470
Can you describe the style of furniture, or does it— In English?

44:09.490 --> 44:09.591
Yeah.

44:09.611 --> 44:18.903
No, there's— This is an ornish— The house was in 1751.

44:18.923 --> 44:19.203
1751.

44:20.705 --> 44:22.848
I would say blue is the predominant color.

44:23.729 --> 44:24.691
Blue, gray, and green.

44:28.015 --> 44:29.277
Gorgeous chandelier.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.102
Gold.

44:35.647 --> 44:37.610
would you call them decorations on the wall?

44:43.780 --> 44:58.144
So there are two, four, six, there are twelve, fourteen, but there are fourteen at the table and then four around it.

45:00.588 --> 45:09.299
It's very seldom that all the members are here at the same time.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.243
And this is where the decisions are made?

45:13.224 --> 45:14.586
Yes.

45:14.606 --> 45:17.890
Or maybe, what do I know?

45:17.970 --> 45:18.871
Because we're supposed to prepare.

45:18.891 --> 45:19.472
That's right.

45:19.492 --> 45:22.676
And again, this is just for the literary award.

45:22.716 --> 45:24.238
Yes, correct.

45:24.278 --> 45:26.941
The other Nobels are done elsewhere by other people.

45:27.082 --> 45:29.785
It's the Royal Science Society.

45:30.541 --> 45:39.313
And that's today, I guess.

45:41.196 --> 45:47.845
That's right.

45:55.296 --> 45:56.958
Okay.

45:56.978 --> 45:59.181
I'll wait here for you if that's okay.

46:00.916 --> 46:21.077
But do you do your does your board to make me you don't know this but do they read the material and it's in their original languages or?

46:21.137 --> 46:21.718
They do too.

46:21.978 --> 46:22.899
That's very important.

46:23.140 --> 46:30.147
When they select a laureate they try to read it in as much as possible in as many translated

46:30.430 --> 46:32.372
as possible.

46:33.673 --> 46:36.316
They don't read it in Swedish or just in English.

46:36.336 --> 46:47.246
They try to read it in French, in German, in English, and if possible, in like Italian or Dutch or Russian or whatever.

46:47.266 --> 46:49.529
This is, again, history of literature.

46:50.469 --> 46:51.350
And this is Yiddish.

46:52.772 --> 46:54.233
You wouldn't believe that, would you?

46:54.253 --> 46:54.553
No.

46:54.573 --> 46:55.514
And that's African.

46:56.095 --> 46:57.576
What is Yiddish?

46:57.917 --> 46:58.277
Yiddish.

46:58.544 --> 47:00.206
Yeah, but Singer won a Nobel.

47:00.226 --> 47:00.586
Yes, right.

47:01.387 --> 47:03.309
And he wrote only in Yiddish.

47:03.509 --> 47:06.391
We got it as a special.

47:07.573 --> 47:09.855
Probably because of him, isn't it?

47:10.736 --> 47:16.041
They knew what they did when he was elected, too.

47:16.061 --> 47:17.342
No, he was wonderful.

47:18.263 --> 47:19.264
That's Romanian.

47:20.645 --> 47:22.927
That's African.

47:23.027 --> 47:25.109
That's Macedonian.

47:25.289 --> 47:26.070
Macedonian.

47:29.257 --> 47:31.762
That's the Jitsi.

47:32.764 --> 47:34.407
Their language.

47:36.190 --> 47:40.558
And the Spanish, of course.

47:40.759 --> 47:46.810
The Slovenian, Slovakian.

47:49.068 --> 47:55.957
We also got, like, Icelandic and , I don't know how you call it.

47:55.977 --> 47:56.458
What's that?

47:56.538 --> 47:57.419
Not the fairy islands.

47:57.439 --> 47:58.220
Which one, though?

47:58.240 --> 47:58.580
Which one?

47:58.921 --> 48:03.346
The islands outside Iceland, between Iceland and Greenland, kind of.

48:03.687 --> 48:06.190
It's a small world of islands.

48:06.290 --> 48:08.013
You know where they are, but you don't know the name.

48:08.073 --> 48:10.235
I don't know the name in English.

48:10.255 --> 48:11.337
It's in there.

48:11.357 --> 48:12.819
Oh, the Faroe Islands, sure.

48:12.839 --> 48:14.060
Yes, right?

48:14.080 --> 48:15.362
No, you know what I'm saying.

48:15.663 --> 48:19.248
And of course this is German, German, German, and again German.

48:21.351 --> 48:22.372
And then you all got it.

48:22.873 --> 48:23.554
Are you in a hurry?

48:23.694 --> 48:24.174
No, no, no.

48:24.194 --> 48:24.715
I'm just checking.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.477
It'll have to be 2 o'clock at the National.

48:26.558 --> 48:27.299
I got plenty of time.

48:27.639 --> 48:30.383
That's Greek and that's Arabic, Armenian.

48:31.164 --> 48:39.595
I just want to show you, to show that we try to collect, we really try to collect pictures from all different parts of the world.

48:40.081 --> 48:46.950
as much as possible, because it's not that easy to know what they write in Tibet, so to say.

48:47.270 --> 48:50.654
You don't read Tibetan, and you don't get to know it, right?

48:51.315 --> 48:55.240
And we don't know anybody living in Tibet who can tell us that these are good workers.

48:55.521 --> 48:56.742
Do you have any Tibetan here?

48:57.203 --> 49:00.447
Yes, we've got Tibet.

49:00.467 --> 49:02.910
But I mean, of course, that's difficult.

49:02.930 --> 49:05.413
That's difficult, but still we try.

49:06.203 --> 49:07.144
As much as possible.

49:07.204 --> 49:08.105
But you have it right there.

49:08.305 --> 49:08.825
But we have it.

49:09.026 --> 49:11.128
Yes.

49:11.148 --> 49:14.571
But again, it indicates... But we try.

49:15.372 --> 49:18.935
It's Mongolian.

49:18.955 --> 49:19.395
That's Tibetan.

49:19.455 --> 49:22.158
That's one book.

49:22.178 --> 49:23.499
One book.

49:23.519 --> 49:25.301
But still it's a book, right?

49:25.321 --> 49:26.102
Is it in Tibetan?

49:27.063 --> 49:27.643
No, it's not in Tibetan.

49:27.663 --> 49:28.744
This is the translation.

49:28.764 --> 49:29.405
What's the title?

49:30.246 --> 49:31.987
This is the book.

49:32.007 --> 49:33.949
Le Lama au Sainte.

49:34.553 --> 49:39.759
That's a brother I love, I think.

49:39.779 --> 49:41.441
But that's, still, Ramon.

49:42.642 --> 49:46.166
That's a novel, right?

49:46.306 --> 49:46.527
Right.

49:46.787 --> 49:49.070
Who's the author?

49:49.090 --> 49:52.994
Yondon, the Lama Yondon.

49:53.014 --> 49:54.115
And that's the translator.

49:54.135 --> 49:59.181
They made a film about it for a few years ago.

49:59.201 --> 50:00.202
Oh, sure.

50:00.483 --> 50:00.783
Yep.

50:00.803 --> 50:01.123
What about Osan?

50:01.143 --> 50:01.804
It's five.

50:01.864 --> 50:02.485
I want to...

50:02.735 --> 50:11.904
I just wanted to show you that... We try our best, what do you do?

50:11.924 --> 50:17.849
But I mean, there's no use in buying books in Vietnamese.

50:17.869 --> 50:19.651
We try to find translations.

50:19.831 --> 50:24.535
We try to use the, what do you call it, European alphabet?

50:25.216 --> 50:29.400
With one exception, that's the Cyrillic alphabet.

50:30.983 --> 50:37.312
So if it's a book in Thai, so to say, we don't buy it in Thai, because nobody can read it.

50:37.332 --> 50:38.533
It's all acrylic, but how about Greek?

50:38.553 --> 50:39.134
That's close.

50:39.535 --> 50:40.075
Sometimes.

50:40.096 --> 50:41.377
Because you have three Greek winners.

50:41.678 --> 50:42.899
Yes, some people.

50:42.919 --> 50:46.064
Yes, but just... That's a massive question.

50:46.104 --> 50:47.205
Yes, yes, yes.

50:47.225 --> 50:48.587
No, but I'll answer.

50:49.468 --> 50:51.151
Because nobody's reading Thai, right?

50:51.171 --> 50:52.793
So what's the use of having a book in Thai?

50:52.993 --> 50:55.236
So then we try to find it in translations.

50:55.557 --> 51:00.163
But if we have a Nobel Prize winner, like, or like...

51:00.869 --> 51:12.070
Then we try to get all his books, even in his original language.

51:12.090 --> 51:13.592
Was it Elitis or Cavati?

51:13.693 --> 51:14.354
Elitis.

51:14.394 --> 51:14.995
Yeah, Elitis.

51:15.696 --> 51:17.520
Cavati is the other Greek.

51:17.540 --> 51:18.000
Yes, right.

51:18.421 --> 51:20.164
That's what we're doing.

51:20.405 --> 51:24.312
As long as they don't get the price, we try to get it in.

51:25.338 --> 51:31.347
the European alphabet, but if they get, then we try to get all of their books in the original language, too.

51:31.367 --> 51:33.149
So we got only on Japanese.

51:34.271 --> 51:39.158
I interviewed him, by the way, from my, I did an interview of Kenzie Bordewin.

51:39.899 --> 51:43.064
Actually, I interviewed a half a dozen Nobel laureates.

51:43.084 --> 51:44.065
Are they happy with our money?

51:45.367 --> 51:51.135
You know, I never ask.

51:51.155 --> 51:54.400
So in Russian, we got quite a few books in Russian.

51:54.953 --> 51:59.139
But this is no use.

51:59.159 --> 52:00.241
It's just Italian.

52:00.281 --> 52:05.949
Well, did we see Nabokov, or do you think he's going to be in... Let me just be clear now.

52:06.049 --> 52:16.624
You aren't getting them in the... One exception, Russian.

52:16.684 --> 52:16.825
Okay.

52:16.885 --> 52:20.650
So they do depend on translation, then, don't they?

52:20.670 --> 52:22.733
Yes, but they can't read Chinese.

52:24.265 --> 52:24.565
Right?

52:24.806 --> 52:24.966
Right.

52:25.206 --> 52:28.592
You can't expect them to read all the languages.

52:28.612 --> 52:29.974
Yes, so they're dependent.

52:30.054 --> 52:33.078
So there are filters that the works have to pass through, is what I'm saying.

52:33.739 --> 52:36.163
Yes, of course.

52:36.183 --> 52:37.565
I mean, they're human beings, right?

52:37.585 --> 52:40.469
I'm just saying, just to consider it as an interesting one.

52:40.489 --> 52:41.912
Yes, right, yes.

52:41.952 --> 52:46.619
Because I've interviewed translators, like Robert Bagels, who did make masters.

52:46.639 --> 52:49.463
Try to read as many translations as possible.

52:50.017 --> 52:51.078
to get a balanced view.

52:51.098 --> 52:51.719
Yes, right.

52:52.060 --> 52:55.344
They try to read a translation in English, in French, and in German.

52:56.725 --> 53:05.837
Because, of course, they are aware of the fact that a translation is changing, that's a word.

53:05.897 --> 53:06.838
Okay, that's very important.

53:06.978 --> 53:08.140
That's very important.

53:08.200 --> 53:08.620
Yes, it sure is.

53:08.640 --> 53:13.326
And, of course, they try to, if they know the language, they try to read.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.950
There are quite a few languages in the world.

53:17.852 --> 53:19.534
That's something to be proud of, too.

53:19.885 --> 53:25.312
We don't all want to speak English.

53:25.472 --> 53:26.853
That's fine.

53:27.394 --> 53:33.221
I have a sixteen-year-old daughter who does all the translations from German and French for me.

53:33.401 --> 53:35.724
Yeah, that's nice.

53:35.904 --> 53:37.426
And over there.

53:38.147 --> 53:40.790
I don't know why I missed it.

53:41.091 --> 53:44.695
This is Nabokov, and this is all in English.

53:45.046 --> 53:47.229
Oh, this is English, McGraw Hill, New Direction.

53:47.309 --> 53:49.252
Yes, but here, that's in Russian.

53:49.272 --> 53:50.053
That's in Russian.

53:50.153 --> 53:54.199
So we have him... Nabokov, Nabokov, Nabokov, Nabokov, Nabokov.

53:54.219 --> 53:55.841
And here he is actually in Triloch.

53:56.041 --> 53:56.342
Yes.

53:57.804 --> 54:01.849
And, uh, so you have him in both, is the answer to what we were saying.

54:01.869 --> 54:04.233
Yes, yes.

54:04.253 --> 54:09.760
We had that from the very beginning, because it was... And then we had him in English.

54:10.321 --> 54:10.862
You can have a look here.

54:11.583 --> 54:14.547
We got him in English, we got him in French,

54:18.273 --> 54:18.895
Okay.

54:18.915 --> 54:19.959
And we got him in Swedish.

54:21.424 --> 54:22.969
Probably got a few in German, too.

54:24.956 --> 54:27.124
So, you know, yeah.

54:27.144 --> 54:29.211
But that's normal, especially the rest.
