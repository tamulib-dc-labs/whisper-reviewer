WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:14.971
I wrote the Death Committee, and it was not a great bestseller, and... The rabbi, you said, was 26 weeks on the New York Times.

00:14.991 --> 00:16.834
26 weeks on the list, yeah.

00:16.854 --> 00:20.500
And the rabbi was published, I'm just thinking, when we met at the end of that, it was published in 65.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.040
Yeah.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.783
And that's cool.

00:22.963 --> 00:24.145
Okay, okay.

00:24.165 --> 00:25.327
And then I wrote the Death Committee.

00:25.667 --> 00:31.236
I seem to remember that the Death Committee was on the Times list for one or two weeks only.

00:31.957 --> 00:32.097
Mm-hmm.

00:32.279 --> 00:43.251
But, you know, it sold pretty well, and it was a Literary Guild selection and all that stuff, and picked up by the Reader's Digest and the Reader's Digest book.

00:43.871 --> 00:47.615
So, you know, it was a successful experience.

00:49.157 --> 00:58.607
The Jerusalem diamond thudded in this country, and I'll tell you why I say in this country.

00:58.857 --> 01:04.964
All along, I got picked up by a few foreign countries, all along with every book.

01:05.705 --> 01:15.956
And the only country that I ever refused was, several times I refused publication in South Africa, because in those days there was apartheid, and I didn't want to be published there.

01:17.418 --> 01:22.003
But the rabbi, I got a German contract for the rabbi.

01:22.543 --> 01:24.746
Don't forget, this isn't that long after World War II.

01:25.186 --> 01:25.707
I'm a Jew.

01:27.369 --> 01:28.510
But I said to myself,

01:28.777 --> 01:29.678
Isn't it wonderful?

01:29.878 --> 01:34.222
God, I want a book of mine called The Rabbi, published in German.

01:34.703 --> 01:38.046
But then when it came out, they didn't have the guts to call it The Rabbi.

01:38.086 --> 01:40.388
They called it A House for the Lord.

01:41.289 --> 01:43.311
And I was absolutely teed off.

01:43.331 --> 01:44.452
And they changed the title.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.334
They changed the title without my consent.

01:47.955 --> 01:55.122
It wasn't until years later when my present publisher, Dremer Knauer, published everything that I've ever written.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.665
And they've all been bestsellers in Europe.

01:58.949 --> 02:03.274
that they published it under the title The Rabbi, so I was very pleased about that.

02:03.634 --> 02:28.602
But then, I'm in the hills, and the books number two and three were not the kind of success that the first book had been, and I take a long time between books, and we're in the hills, and I waste two years on the only thing I've ever tried that I didn't publish.

02:28.936 --> 02:31.900
which was a spy novel, a lousy spy novel.

02:34.163 --> 02:40.511
And I guess that's the answer why I should never try to write something I'm not really interested in, because I don't like spy novels.

02:40.531 --> 02:41.773
So why did you try it?

02:41.793 --> 02:43.715
Because it was time to write another book.

02:43.815 --> 02:48.281
I had kids to feed, and I came up with the only idea that was there at the moment.

02:48.381 --> 02:53.007
And meanwhile, staring you in the face is just your knowledge of medicine and science.

02:53.127 --> 02:53.908
Wait, wait, wait.

02:53.928 --> 02:55.230
So what happened was I tried this

02:56.240 --> 02:58.684
the spy novel, and I threw it away.

02:58.964 --> 02:59.665
Two years work.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.688
Two years is unbelievable.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.612
You literally trashed it?

03:05.013 --> 03:06.415
Well, it's in a drawer someplace.

03:06.555 --> 03:08.598
It's in a drawer someplace.

03:08.618 --> 03:12.704
No, I still have my master's thesis, which is unpublishable, but I still own it.

03:13.645 --> 03:19.634
And Lorraine and I looked at one another, and we loved living there.

03:19.814 --> 03:25.162
And she said, look, try another book.

03:25.202 --> 03:25.943
And we didn't have

03:26.210 --> 03:31.036
By that time, we had a nice house and three growing kids, and I needed a source of income.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.519
And she said, try another book.

03:34.099 --> 03:34.740
Try another book.

03:34.900 --> 03:39.186
And if it doesn't work, you're going to have to get the best job you can find.

03:39.266 --> 03:45.193
And I figured, here comes another newspaper, but you can't work on a newspaper and live in Nashville, Massachusetts.

03:45.213 --> 03:51.721
And I sat there, and I thought of this medical novel and sent it off to my agent, which is where we pick up the conversation.

03:51.741 --> 03:52.842
And this is still the same agency?

03:52.940 --> 03:54.042
They're still the same agent.

03:54.162 --> 03:55.605
And name her once again for her?

03:55.625 --> 03:56.726
Pat Chartle.

03:56.747 --> 03:57.247
Okay.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.810
Now Pat Chartle, Myra.

03:59.070 --> 04:02.456
And just, I know we spelled it very, spelled it early, early on.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.141
S-C-H-A-R-T-L-E.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.403
So what I'm transcribing.

04:06.423 --> 04:07.926
She was a fine agent, yeah.

04:08.426 --> 04:13.996
And so this book was The Physician.

04:14.016 --> 04:14.938
And who did you sell this one?

04:14.958 --> 04:16.741
And I sold it to Simon & Schuster.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.103
Okay, so you've got McGraw-Hill.

04:18.387 --> 04:20.370
The second book was... Random House.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.194
I did not stay at the same publishing house.

04:23.394 --> 04:25.477
The third one was Simon & Schuster.

04:25.838 --> 04:31.706
So you really haven't developed, pardon me for jumping on that kind of a close rapport with a particular editor.

04:31.766 --> 04:33.509
No, but let me tell you what happened.

04:34.450 --> 04:48.090
And I'll tell you in the same vein that you told me what happened at Random House, but there are some things I would just assume not, you know, start an ancient war about.

04:48.307 --> 04:52.871
What happened was I went to Simon Schuster.

04:52.891 --> 04:57.736
I had the best editor I've ever met in my life, maybe outside of my daughter.

04:57.776 --> 05:00.979
She's really a good editor, but he really was a terrific editor.

05:01.039 --> 05:01.860
And his name was?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.184
And his name was Herman Golub, G-O-L-L-U-B.

05:06.725 --> 05:11.710
At just the wrong moment, he left to become editor-in-chief at Doubleday.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.973
At exactly the wrong moment, my book was about to come out.

05:15.513 --> 05:17.335
Excuse me, I don't have that date.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.969
Don't worry about it.

05:18.989 --> 05:19.830
65 is the day.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.212
The day of publication.

05:21.413 --> 05:23.996
And Herman was a really fine editor.

05:24.437 --> 05:27.742
I mean, a good manuscript man, you know, a good editor.

05:28.022 --> 05:28.563
Line editor.

05:28.743 --> 05:29.424
Line editor.

05:29.464 --> 05:30.526
He's a good editor.

05:30.586 --> 05:31.848
He's a really fine editor.

05:32.669 --> 05:39.820
And when he left, what actually happened was I got turned over to a guy named Fred Hills.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.483
I don't want this in, and I trust you.

05:42.764 --> 05:45.668
Fred Hills lied to me from the very beginning, told me he had sent

05:45.901 --> 06:12.077
things out to other authors for quote never said I've heard this so often never never sent a letter Ted Wiesner up in Portsmouth and they did the same thing well well listen this is right in the beginning and I caught him at several lies within two days and you know what I said to him because it was obvious to me what was happening I couldn't I couldn't be out of there they had me I said I never want to talk to you again for the rest of my life and I never did

06:12.479 --> 06:18.754
And if he had to contact me, he went through my agent, if I had to contact him, and the book was a disaster.

06:18.814 --> 06:20.879
They sold something like 10,000 copies.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.207
And I was distraught.

06:24.228 --> 06:30.623
I had worked The Physician, which is a blockbuster all over the world, you know.

06:30.873 --> 06:33.597
Well, we have to say... Five million copies.

06:33.617 --> 06:43.690
Well, we have to say that there were problems with your... Well, what you can say... That you don't care to get into... No, I would appreciate it if you don't.

06:43.990 --> 06:48.035
Let me offer you a suggestion and see if you can buy it.

06:48.196 --> 06:52.461
Because I told you... There has to be some explanation for the fact that it belonged in the U.S.

06:52.521 --> 06:56.787
Yeah, you can tell them that I... Do it this way.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.310
We can tell them without telling them because you can tell them...

06:59.729 --> 07:08.184
You can quote me, direct quotes, as saying, I had always heard that when one becomes an orphan, you know, it was a disaster.

07:08.625 --> 07:12.713
My book was orphaned, you know, as far as the editor was concerned.

07:14.857 --> 07:23.813
But I found that it really made a great difference, and the book did not do well at all in the United States.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.142
You can say this.

07:25.222 --> 07:26.444
And what year was this?

07:26.624 --> 07:27.665
This was during my watch.

07:27.705 --> 07:29.929
This is going to be late 70s, early 80s.

07:29.969 --> 07:32.332
You can call my agent and he can fill you in.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.936
Because by that time, several things happened.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.178
So I left my editor.

07:36.639 --> 07:41.065
Also, Pat Charvel got married and left me, left the business.

07:41.245 --> 07:42.167
You're a double orphan.

07:42.187 --> 07:43.429
I'm a double orphan.

07:43.529 --> 07:46.033
I was really distraught.

07:46.053 --> 07:48.136
I'm going to use that quote, a double orphan.

07:48.156 --> 07:49.117
Well, I was.

07:49.137 --> 07:51.100
And...

07:51.383 --> 08:11.535
It's something I've never gotten into with a PWP, so I'd like to... Yeah, and at my request, Jing went up and talked to Simon & Schuster, and because the book wasn't selling, Joni Evans was happy to release me for my obligation for my next book.

08:12.106 --> 08:14.610
You know, and that took care of Simon Schuster.

08:14.630 --> 08:14.810
Really?

08:14.850 --> 08:15.611
She was happy?

08:16.012 --> 08:17.794
Well, I mean, I assume that.

08:17.814 --> 08:20.518
Now, was the book doing great in Europe simultaneously?

08:20.538 --> 08:21.720
Well, this is what happened.

08:21.740 --> 08:25.045
Not simultaneously, but almost simultaneously.

08:25.065 --> 08:27.188
It would have prompted them to take another look.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.429
A little bit after.

08:28.449 --> 08:30.793
Now you've already been released.

08:31.193 --> 08:32.315
I've been released.

08:32.335 --> 08:33.276
I've been released.

08:33.296 --> 08:39.345
And a guy comes from Europe named...

08:40.540 --> 08:43.643
Carl Blessing, Carl Heinz Blessing, Dr. Blessing.

08:44.944 --> 08:46.285
Pardon me?

08:46.926 --> 08:55.354
Excuse me, he's a doctor, and it's K-A-R-L, middle initial H, Blessing, B-L-E-S-S-I-N-G.

08:56.755 --> 09:06.204
And Carl sees a little notice in the catalog, the S&S catalog.

09:06.244 --> 09:09.467
Comes twice a year to buy books for his backlist, American books.

09:10.274 --> 09:20.868
And he says, that's interesting, reads the book, falls in love with it, takes it back, the whole company fell in love with it, you know, Jerome Knauer.

09:21.909 --> 09:25.974
And what he did was he backed it to the hilt.

09:26.054 --> 09:39.572
In contrast to what was happening in America, he ordered 5,000 reader's copies, paperback, free reader's copies, gave one not only to every bookstore manager, gave one to every book clerk in Germany.

09:39.612 --> 09:39.792
Wow.

09:40.784 --> 09:41.165
You know?

09:41.345 --> 09:42.947
Now what's the name of the publisher again?

09:43.127 --> 09:43.648
Dromer.

09:43.748 --> 09:45.951
D-R-O-E-M-E-R.

09:46.092 --> 09:47.313
D-R-O-E-M-E-R.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.014
Okay, right.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.677
D-R-O-E-M-E-R.

09:49.697 --> 09:49.837
Okay.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.519
There's no umlaut.

09:51.559 --> 09:54.463
No umlaut, but K-N-A-U-R.

09:54.704 --> 09:55.265
No dash.

09:55.605 --> 09:56.026
No, no.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.529
Just Dromer, Knauer.

09:58.549 --> 10:04.538
And, and, um, and the book, uh, first... Do you know the year approximately?

10:04.558 --> 10:06.100
I don't know if I've asked you just a couple of times.

10:06.603 --> 10:07.504
This is huge.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.446
This is a year approximately.

10:09.807 --> 10:10.307
We'll get to it.

10:10.327 --> 10:11.428
Let's go on.

10:11.448 --> 10:11.549
Okay.

10:11.829 --> 10:13.531
Yeah, I can get it.

10:13.671 --> 10:15.413
I probably have a copy here somewhere.

10:15.453 --> 10:16.895
Physician in Germany.

10:16.975 --> 10:17.676
Yeah.

10:18.156 --> 10:20.399
Lorraine, when was the Physician first published in Germany?

10:20.419 --> 10:21.540
Do you know?

10:21.560 --> 10:21.800
Let me know.

10:21.820 --> 10:22.221
Okay, thanks.

10:22.261 --> 10:24.283
You're a good kid.

10:24.804 --> 10:25.925
What title?

10:25.945 --> 10:26.506
The Physician?

10:26.966 --> 10:31.671
They published it under the title Medicus, which means the physician.

10:31.691 --> 10:32.232
How do you spell?

10:32.492 --> 10:33.794
M-E-D-I-C-U-S.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.855
Okay.

10:35.189 --> 10:37.392
M-E-D-I-C-U-S?

10:37.552 --> 10:38.874
Yeah, D-E-R.

10:38.894 --> 10:39.254
D-E-R.

10:39.875 --> 10:40.776
Dere Medicus.

10:41.337 --> 10:42.459
And it means the physician.

10:43.480 --> 10:43.780
Okay.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.361
Okay.

10:45.502 --> 10:50.429
And then, you know, Kyle would say, it's doing wonderfully through, and it just went off the charts.

10:50.930 --> 10:58.159
You know, it just... And it was unbelievable to me, because, you know, I had tasted this with the rabbi, but there had been a long...

10:58.730 --> 11:28.686
drug in between so it was really lovely lovely lovely and and he asked us over and and i and lorraine and two of my children met us there and we we had a wonderful first uh visit you know let me back up just a bit how did dr blessing become aware of the physician he saw a little right up in the in the uh

11:28.953 --> 11:32.677
Simon & Schuster catalog, and said, that's an interesting thing.

11:32.717 --> 11:33.778
I'd like to look into that.

11:33.878 --> 11:34.358
Read it.

11:34.379 --> 11:36.721
Talk about just fortuitous little things.

11:36.901 --> 11:37.602
Yeah, yeah.

11:37.622 --> 11:40.505
That was published in the United States in 86.

11:40.785 --> 11:41.706
Okay, U.S.

11:41.726 --> 11:42.106
86.

11:42.347 --> 11:43.368
And Germany in 87.

11:43.428 --> 11:44.809
So the next year.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.050
Yeah, it was the next year.

11:46.150 --> 11:52.737
Right after I had bombed in America, he bought it, and it became an explosion in Europe.

11:53.077 --> 11:55.060
You were talking about just a 10-year phenomenon.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.542
Yeah, but then what happened was,

11:57.742 --> 12:03.908
It spread because it went from country to country.

12:04.088 --> 12:07.492
And I've got to tell you this, because this is interesting for PW.

12:08.313 --> 12:14.499
In Spain, they bought it, probably largely on the success in Germany, and it bombed.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.323
The first time they bought it, they got a lot of returns.

12:18.463 --> 12:20.925
People just didn't know about it, you know.

12:20.945 --> 12:25.129
And this will show you fortuitousness in the book business.

12:25.149 --> 12:27.732
One of the book managers was ill.

12:28.572 --> 12:34.939
gets up at two o'clock in the morning, can't sleep, says, what the hell do I have on the shelf, reaches out, grabs a book.

12:36.240 --> 12:44.810
It's their book, you know, their copy of The Physician, which has just been returned by the, you know, Carlos.

12:46.231 --> 12:53.079
He didn't stop reading until he read every last word and then began going in and saying, you gotta take this again, this is a great book.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.442
That was on one level.

12:55.582 --> 12:58.545
On another level, there's a medium-sized store

12:58.610 --> 13:06.559
in Barcelona, an independent bookseller named Maite, M-A-I-T-E.

13:06.579 --> 13:15.049
And Maite, she goes by just that one name, Maite fell in love with the book and is a very aggressive woman.

13:15.249 --> 13:23.478
And every time somebody came into the store, this is literal, she would grab them and say, I've got a book and you can't leave unless you read this book.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.560
You've got to buy this book.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.642
There's a plaque in her store

13:26.926 --> 13:32.595
because in the very beginning she saw something like, honestly asked Lorraine, something like 4,000 books.

13:33.015 --> 13:54.148
I don't know how many, we'll have to check the, you can call and ask when you talk to her, but between my day and this manager who saw the light, I was number one before the book took off in Spain, and since then all of my books have taken off in Spain, and the two

13:54.736 --> 14:00.423
awards that I've won in Spain, the two Silver Bass Prizes, are popularity contests, really.

14:00.643 --> 14:02.846
They're not done by juries.

14:02.886 --> 14:03.847
Second numbers.

14:04.007 --> 14:05.569
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.293
So that's what happened there.

14:09.294 --> 14:20.187
Meanwhile, in this country, we go to Dutton, my present publisher, which published

14:21.128 --> 14:22.069
After the physician.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.411
After the physician.

14:23.451 --> 14:24.152
Shaman.

14:24.213 --> 14:25.034
Shaman is next.

14:25.134 --> 14:27.277
And we go to Dutton.

14:27.357 --> 14:44.703
So I say to Dutton, I don't think this is telling tales out of school, it probably is, but I said to people at Dutton, why don't you take on the ad saying, oh, because my work had already become, you know, greatly received, hugely received in Europe.

14:45.224 --> 14:48.148
So why don't you take on the ad and say, oh, already,

14:48.787 --> 14:51.651
an international bestseller.

14:51.711 --> 14:53.313
They said, can't do that.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.576
Somebody actually said this to me.

14:56.518 --> 15:01.605
Their marketing people decided that people would think it was a European book, not an American book.

15:01.665 --> 15:03.748
This is a book about the American Civil War.

15:06.511 --> 15:06.792
Right?

15:08.174 --> 15:09.816
But this time, they

15:10.150 --> 15:12.833
Thank God for this book.

15:14.174 --> 15:18.399
But now you've reached the point where you're publishing in Europe before you're publishing in the States.

15:18.419 --> 15:18.980
Is that right?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.642
Is this the first time this has happened?

15:20.982 --> 15:23.885
No, last time was the first time it happened.

15:23.905 --> 15:27.729
So basically... The last two books I published in Europe first.

15:27.749 --> 15:29.051
Which ones now?

15:29.231 --> 15:31.053
Shaman and this book.

15:31.113 --> 15:32.815
Okay, so these last two books.

15:32.835 --> 15:32.935
Yeah.

15:34.113 --> 15:37.496
And do you consider yourself something of an expatriate, right?

15:37.516 --> 15:39.057
Or do you remember maintaining that?

15:39.538 --> 15:40.118
No, no.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.744
First of all, I don't grieve because that happened.

15:47.625 --> 15:55.872
I honestly think that I'm going to sell again in the United States the way I sell in Europe.

15:56.532 --> 16:00.736
But I have never grieved about it because I think you can understand this.

16:01.997 --> 16:03.478
It's such a precarious...

16:04.083 --> 16:27.142
profession that when it happened all over the place in other countries, that was gratifying enough so that I'm an American writer, I live here, I work here, I want people to read me here, but it was so gratifying that it was happening someplace else and I'm happy.

16:27.683 --> 16:33.668
Now, I want it to happen here, you know, I'm not saying I don't, but

16:34.357 --> 16:39.525
But I've gotten so much joy and fulfillment out of other countries.

16:39.545 --> 16:44.833
And at first I said— I just can't think of any other case where this is—any other instance where this has happened.

16:44.853 --> 16:45.915
Can you think of anything else?

16:45.975 --> 16:46.376
No, I don't.

16:46.536 --> 16:47.377
I mean, I really don't.

16:47.397 --> 16:50.001
I know other writers do better overseas.

16:50.182 --> 16:51.243
Yeah, but American writers?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.827
There are some American writers that do better overseas.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.709
And they do here.

16:54.729 --> 16:59.436
Yeah, my agent could tell you if he—and he told me a couple— Did you have any new agent to come out of the room?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.709
Eugene Winnick, W-I-N-I-C-K.

17:03.170 --> 17:04.151
W-I-N-I-C-K.

17:04.531 --> 17:06.413
W-I-N-I-C-K.

17:07.154 --> 17:08.455
McIntosh and Otis.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.878
And God, I've called that for so many years.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.561
I should remember the number, but let me look at it.

17:13.921 --> 17:15.743
I'll give it to you.

17:15.823 --> 17:20.188
You might as well have it.

17:20.228 --> 17:22.991
It's area code 212-687-7400.

17:24.172 --> 17:25.013
Okay.

17:25.714 --> 17:28.377
And so...

17:28.846 --> 17:58.819
there was something, oh, and it's been wonderful because at first I said to myself, well, maybe it's just that something I write, something in my psyche, the German readers respond to, you know, except it's happened that way, you know, in Spain, wildly successful, number one, you know, Brazil, bestseller-dom in Italy, you know, and I published

17:59.120 --> 18:01.703
to an enormous number of countries now.

18:02.184 --> 18:05.127
Can you tell them that as a result, every book you've written?

18:05.848 --> 18:06.810
Every book you've written?

18:06.850 --> 18:16.381
Yeah, including the weak failures in America, you know, the Jerusalem Diamond, the Death Committee, everything has been a bestseller in Europe.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.907
And all these books on the bestseller?

18:20.987 --> 18:24.652
At the same time, I had five books on the list.

18:25.152 --> 18:26.494
This is in Germany.

18:26.828 --> 18:30.878
But it was, you know, I don't know, 15 or whatever list.

18:30.898 --> 18:37.775
And Shaman was the top selling, gotten European book, book in Europe.

18:37.895 --> 18:39.960
I think they said Shaman was

18:40.058 --> 18:41.559
So what's wrong in this country?

18:41.660 --> 18:43.421
Can you have a clue on this?

18:43.561 --> 18:46.304
Well, I think... Do you think the marketing can be a little more aggressive?

18:46.324 --> 18:47.225
Well, well, no.

18:47.245 --> 18:53.151
I don't know what you have to say on the record, but... Well, for off the record, I'll tell you what it is in this country.

18:53.231 --> 19:01.459
I don't want to be quoted, because immediately four publishers are going to say, no, stuff stinks, that's why we didn't do it, if you say this.

19:01.479 --> 19:06.964
We're a genre, as far as fiction is concerned, we're built around genres, you know?

19:07.324 --> 19:08.125
They publish.

19:08.375 --> 19:32.155
mainly i'm not saying that they don't know american publishers american publishers publish uh murder mysteries now there's a murder in my next book but not because it's a murder story you know that's sometimes part of life but but i'm talking about the genre books murder mysteries used to be westerns they're still somewhat alive

19:32.573 --> 19:34.936
The big thing is romance books.

19:35.016 --> 19:35.577
Look at that.

19:36.078 --> 19:44.549
If the big thing was science fiction, there'd be a spaceship on the cover.

19:44.569 --> 19:48.635
And everything is geared to, what did your last book do?

19:49.175 --> 19:52.279
Business people run the companies now, no longer.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.984
Editorial people, they can't afford to go with their hunches.

19:56.665 --> 19:58.568
So they look at your last book.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.652
I've got a book at Simon & Schuster, sold

20:01.953 --> 20:03.094
10,000 copies.

20:03.715 --> 20:06.318
They're not terribly interested in me, you know?

20:06.679 --> 20:10.203
Now, then I have a book, Shaman, didn't sell well.

20:11.284 --> 20:12.906
They're not terribly interested in this book.

20:13.066 --> 20:22.237
Now, they are, because now things have gotten so big in Europe that I have been talked to by publishers.

20:22.297 --> 20:24.600
I don't know how much we want to say about that.

20:24.620 --> 20:28.805
But now, for my next book, I'm in a very good position.

20:28.825 --> 20:29.967
The book following this one?

20:29.987 --> 20:31.909
The book following this one, you know?

20:32.058 --> 20:33.960
And you told me already, I think, what that was.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.323
Did you tell me what it was?

20:36.343 --> 20:38.485
It's The Secret Jew, a book about the Inquisition.

20:38.525 --> 20:41.228
It was novel about the idea in Spain.

20:41.248 --> 20:42.549
In Spain.

20:43.170 --> 21:00.028
And what's happened is not only gratifying from the sense of someone who sits in a room and writes and doesn't know what the hell's going to happen to it and has had success and failure both, but it's been wonderful.

21:00.569 --> 21:01.710
I had never been to Europe

21:02.382 --> 21:05.765
I had never been to Europe until that first trip to Germany.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.707
Now we've been to a number of countries.

21:07.747 --> 21:08.948
We've met a number of people.

21:09.509 --> 21:22.141
They all respond to this work by an American writer, and it indicates to me that they may like more garlic or less garlic or more of this or less of that, but they're all interested in the same thing.

21:22.161 --> 21:23.763
They're interested in their kids.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.384
They're interested in a world at peace.

21:25.805 --> 21:31.410
They're interested in jobs for their children and security and education for their kids.

21:32.099 --> 21:37.547
you know, and a job for themselves, and the economy, and a place to live.

21:38.168 --> 21:41.894
We all have the same, the very same needs.

21:41.994 --> 21:46.901
You certainly, because you don't, you can't even read the editions that most of these are published in.

21:47.101 --> 21:56.215
You can't read the languages and the translations, but you know, because you've written the story, but are you mindful now of these, of an international audience when you're writing?

21:56.515 --> 21:58.158
Are you still writing the same way you want to get?

21:58.879 --> 22:00.942
No, I'm writing the way I've always written,

22:01.124 --> 22:05.550
which is to please, honestly, honestly, because I think this is the only way anybody can ever write.

22:06.071 --> 22:07.052
It's to please me.

22:07.552 --> 22:10.817
And then she'll read it and maybe we'll fight about something.

22:11.017 --> 22:13.781
My daughter will read it and an editor.

22:13.841 --> 22:22.312
But I don't write for her or my daughter or the editor or the person in Spain or in Italy or in Germany or in Bulgaria or wherever the hell it is.

22:23.233 --> 22:27.379
Really and truly, I write the way you write.

22:27.499 --> 22:29.241
You want to please me.

22:29.677 --> 22:37.145
I feel that it's a tremendous advantage to me that all my life I've been a really hungry and enjoying reader.

22:37.946 --> 22:40.269
Because I write the kind of book I look for.

22:40.289 --> 22:43.853
I try to write the kind of book I look for.

22:44.533 --> 22:51.661
And I think that any writer has to be a reader.

22:51.701 --> 22:52.342
Who do you read?

22:53.483 --> 22:54.024
Everybody.

22:55.145 --> 22:56.166
Literally everybody.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.650
We buy a lot of books.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.590
use public libraries.

23:01.851 --> 23:16.713
You know, I'm an old library trustee, and I have terrific admiration for the libraries we have in this country, which a lot of European countries don't have, you know.

23:16.733 --> 23:17.434
That's great.

23:17.454 --> 23:17.734
Yeah.

23:18.675 --> 23:25.305
So, that's... You know what, I think we've probably... You've got enough?

23:25.325 --> 23:25.826
Yeah.

23:25.846 --> 23:28.590
Well, these are the points that I wanted to hit.

23:28.756 --> 23:29.297
Okay.

23:29.457 --> 23:32.441
And I'll just get home and start transcribing.

23:32.461 --> 23:33.502
Well, I'm here by phone.

23:33.742 --> 23:38.068
And you're here by phone, and you can do me some good in negotiations.

23:38.829 --> 23:41.613
And it's okay if you don't, because I've been a journalist too.

23:41.653 --> 23:42.674
My pleasure, please.

23:42.694 --> 23:43.074
Okay.

23:45.638 --> 23:56.772
I think that the best situation, you know, the ideal situation is for a writer to finish a book and then market it.

23:57.697 --> 24:02.201
And that's the way I have preferred to work with, you know, several books.

24:02.221 --> 24:03.523
So basically it's one book?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.104
And then have a contract, yeah.

24:05.504 --> 24:07.266
Oh, so you actually sell the book when it's done?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.988
That's what I would prefer it to do.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.649
As opposed to selling the book?

24:10.669 --> 24:11.951
Yeah, that's what I did last time.

24:12.611 --> 24:14.393
You didn't sell a book idea, you sell it.

24:14.573 --> 24:15.574
I sell the book.

24:15.594 --> 24:19.238
And this is what your procedure has basically done?

24:19.378 --> 24:20.659
Not every time.

24:20.859 --> 24:25.864
I've had contracts, yeah, but that's what I would prefer to do.

24:26.654 --> 24:35.593
However, this time I probably will sign a contract because I'm being... Pursued?

24:35.614 --> 24:36.415
Pressed.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.578
Yeah.

24:37.598 --> 24:41.907
Because, you know, there are publishers who... You're persuaded by others.

24:41.927 --> 24:45.034
I'm being persuaded, but I'll probably sign a contract.

24:45.655 --> 24:53.065
I think it would be good if you don't go into that.

24:53.165 --> 24:54.968
I'll tell you what this is about.

24:54.988 --> 24:57.291
Just tell me the context that we're talking about here in general.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.433
I'll tell you what it's about.

24:58.653 --> 25:09.368
Well, I think in general I would prefer to write the book, you know, and I now can afford to do that, thank God, and get it to your satisfaction, and then

25:09.753 --> 25:39.051
you know then you know and they know exactly what they're going to get there's no gambling and and you know you're in a good position to market it but uh off the record what what is happening is that the the company that i have been so successful with in germany has had an internal uh splitting uh one man has gone to the other giant house in in germany bafflesman

25:39.267 --> 25:41.630
They're both pursuing me, you know.

25:42.211 --> 25:46.997
Yeah, so as my agent said, it's a nice problem.

25:47.057 --> 25:50.941
So he said... Tell me the name of your current publisher again.

25:50.961 --> 25:53.104
My current publisher is Jeremiah Knauer.

25:53.845 --> 26:06.000
So he said, Gene said, Noah, if you can, I'm telling you boldly and frankly, my agent said, if you can drop into the thing somehow that you're

26:06.200 --> 26:31.735
you know seriously considering signing a contract for this book both sides are going to be very interested in considering you mean signing contracts for my next for this before writing it before writing it see like this book is finished before he sold oh i see and you are and you are you're not you're not under contract anybody right now for the next work no oh it's like move on with the and what happens and what happens is i have

26:31.985 --> 26:34.749
Well, it's a good position to be in business-wise.

26:34.889 --> 26:38.274
It's a tough position to be in because I have friends in both camps.

26:39.355 --> 26:40.437
You've got to do what's best for you.

26:40.457 --> 26:42.079
You've got to do what's best for you, of course.

26:43.681 --> 26:48.648
So that's going on now, and it might be over by the time this comes out, but it might not be.

26:48.668 --> 26:49.970
I'll read this to you.

26:50.130 --> 26:53.255
If you talk to your agent, you might tell him to expect a call from me.

26:53.635 --> 26:53.816
Okay.

26:54.136 --> 26:54.877
I'll call him today.

26:55.218 --> 26:57.521
And if he has things about figures and stuff.

26:57.982 --> 27:01.907
Well, the best place to get some really astounding figures

27:02.258 --> 27:05.001
is from Claudia Limmer in Germany.

27:05.121 --> 27:06.442
But he'll give you other figures.

27:06.602 --> 27:07.883
Gene will give you whatever you need.

27:08.324 --> 27:19.854
But Claudia, you should, if you will, if you call both Claudia Limmer and Silvia Quirini in Spain, they can tell you something.

27:19.974 --> 27:22.517
The best time to call them is very early in the morning.

27:23.317 --> 27:24.078
You can fax them.

27:24.098 --> 27:25.860
I'll give you both of their fax numbers too.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.002
Okay, wait a minute.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.243
Yeah, because then you're not wasting your money.

27:29.263 --> 27:29.363
Yeah.

27:29.647 --> 27:30.568
Well, I'll put it.

27:30.588 --> 27:31.109
It doesn't matter.

27:31.129 --> 27:32.991
It's better to call them, I think.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.074
As long as they speak English.

27:35.094 --> 27:43.044
And Claudia just got a good new job as Director of Public Relations to a non-fiction house, so I'm not going to be working with her anymore.

27:43.084 --> 27:45.627
But she'll be there until the end of the month.

27:45.647 --> 27:46.288
Okay.

27:46.789 --> 27:54.018
Now, you've never had, you know, through all this discussion this morning, you never once had you mentioned any kind of a close relationship with an editor.
