WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:05.411
You could have called this book The Prodigy, I think, not just The Soloist.

00:07.114 --> 00:08.757
Why The Soloist?

00:10.319 --> 00:15.969
Well, the reason I considered The Prodigy, we talked about titles that had Prodigy in it.

00:16.269 --> 00:27.068
But the thing is, in my mind, it's not really about Prodigy so much as it's about how people in general have to deal with that gap.

00:27.453 --> 00:34.167
between the way they wish their lives were, what they think their lives should be at this moment, and where their lives really are.

00:34.247 --> 00:41.442
I think we all cope with that at one time or another, but I, for the sake of telling a story, thought it would be interesting to create an extreme case.

00:42.204 --> 00:46.052
I was thinking in my mind, since how can I create a character

00:46.420 --> 00:50.806
for whom this would be a real problem that would throw it into an extra intense light.

00:50.826 --> 00:59.237
And I thought, well, why not have someone whose life, whose real life actually did match his expectations for a while and then have it taken away?

00:59.297 --> 01:04.064
So that was really what I began with.

01:05.966 --> 01:11.914
But then it's interesting that in the writing of it, of course, I had to explore a lot about prodigies and all.

01:11.954 --> 01:14.638
And so, of course, that is a strong theme in the book.

01:14.737 --> 01:20.931
My initial intention was for it to be about something that we'd all be familiar with, a little bit like the book Remains of the Day.

01:21.392 --> 01:23.256
You mentioned that in the PW interview.

01:23.556 --> 01:25.621
Yeah, oh, that book.

01:25.861 --> 01:26.443
It's a great book.

01:26.543 --> 01:27.505
It's so good.

01:27.705 --> 01:30.231
I just loved that so much.

01:30.464 --> 01:34.930
That really was a big influence when I was writing this book.

01:34.950 --> 01:35.330
Really?

01:35.350 --> 01:35.871
I think so.

01:36.071 --> 01:40.477
People see his name, and if they know very little about him, they think he's a Japanese writer.

01:40.617 --> 01:40.917
Yeah.

01:40.937 --> 01:43.380
But in fact, he's an English writer.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.302
Yeah, yeah.

01:44.322 --> 01:46.384
And he is very much, I think, which is important.

01:46.504 --> 01:50.449
I mean, he's writing in the English tradition.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.252
That's no big point.

01:52.652 --> 01:59.661
I think it's really amusing for him that so many people who have read his books, and even reviews, have said, you know,

01:59.911 --> 02:05.060
He's so much within the Japanese tradition, and it must really sometimes pester him.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.885
But hey, that's a tradition I wouldn't mind being associated with.

02:08.085 --> 02:08.907
It's a lovely book.

02:10.069 --> 02:12.813
And I understand the film is really different.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.234
Oh, it's beautiful.

02:13.254 --> 02:13.775
Have you seen it?

02:13.795 --> 02:14.075
Yes, yes.

02:14.236 --> 02:19.665
And I went fully expecting that I couldn't like it nearly as much, and I liked it as much.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.971
It's just different enough that it stands on its own.

02:23.031 --> 02:25.395
And of course, the actors in it are...

02:25.510 --> 02:36.482
My wife and I went to see it and we were supposed to go to dinner with friends afterwards, and we had cried so hard during the movie we had to stop at a 7-Eleven parking lot just to get ourselves arranged.

02:37.043 --> 02:37.323
That's funny.

02:38.064 --> 02:39.606
Did you start with that single premise?

02:39.666 --> 02:45.092
Because you really do have three themes writing for this book, maybe three, two, three.

02:45.112 --> 02:50.978
No, actually the original premise, the original problem that I got kind of

02:51.515 --> 02:59.767
that started to nag at me that I wanted to resolve through a fictional story was the problem, well I'll describe how the problem was presented to me.

03:00.068 --> 03:03.834
I was in a car and I overheard a conversation between two people in the front seat.

03:04.414 --> 03:12.747
One woman said, you know I just read an article about Asian philosophy and they say that these Zen masters

03:12.997 --> 03:24.029
have achieved psychological freedom, that they are no longer burdened by our social conventions and our notions of right and wrong, that they realize these are relative positions.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.911
She said, do you suppose that's possible?

03:25.951 --> 03:28.814
And then the other person said, I really don't know.

03:28.955 --> 03:32.879
And so this first woman said, see, I have a problem with that, though.

03:32.899 --> 03:41.248
If a Zen master has transcended our social conventions, how could you tell the difference between him and a psychopath?

03:41.667 --> 03:59.010
And then I remember afterwards, it kept bugging me, and I thought, that's a good question, because actually we judge people as being either religious geniuses or psychopaths according to our social conventions and our ideas of ethical wisdom and all.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.153
So how do we tell the difference?

04:01.353 --> 04:06.239
And I really got so attracted to the problem of how to articulate the difference.

04:06.259 --> 04:09.444
I think we all feel there's a difference, but how do you articulate it?

04:10.064 --> 04:11.286
So originally...

04:11.873 --> 04:21.385
I got the idea of this trial of the Zen monster, but in the early drafts I realized, though, to make that the focus of the story, it was a little bit too hitting the nail on the head.

04:21.905 --> 04:29.755
It got a little bit dry, and I felt it would be more interesting to tell that story as seen or heard by someone who would be indirectly affected by it.

04:30.296 --> 04:40.328
And he is working out this other major, I don't want to call it a crisis in his life, but certainly he's at one of these watershed points where

04:40.797 --> 04:47.587
I mean with the young man that he's finally decided to teach and he's astonished by the talent.

04:47.668 --> 04:52.395
I mean they are working together I think in a very interesting kind of a way.

04:53.717 --> 05:01.188
It is interesting now that you mentioned it, it is kind of a flip on the Amadeus theme isn't it?

05:01.208 --> 05:04.273
Your character is certainly not mediocre.

05:04.777 --> 05:10.283
The protagonist is not mediocre, and also he doesn't really resent the kid.

05:10.303 --> 05:12.525
I think maybe he sees the kid as his chance.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.688
Or at least eventually, I think.

05:16.049 --> 05:23.717
At first he doesn't know what to think, I think, because it reminds him of what he thinks he should be doing, and that's painful.

05:23.997 --> 05:28.742
Should be doing or could be doing?

05:28.908 --> 05:34.174
Is there acceptance on his part that it's not likely to be for him?

05:34.194 --> 05:34.815
I think there is.

05:34.835 --> 05:45.928
I hope that there is toward the end of the story, but I wanted it to be that toward the beginning you feel that he still has not been able to accept the idea that this is going to go on forever.

05:46.228 --> 05:54.578
He may be able to say that, but in his heart he still feels like a bit of a ghost, so insubstantial.

05:54.929 --> 05:59.414
A sense of identity is being a concert musician, and he's not a concert musician.

06:00.596 --> 06:07.364
At least in my imagination it seems it would be hard for him to feel that he has any life at all until he gets back to who he really is.

06:07.404 --> 06:09.947
It's not really a Pygmalion theme, is it?

06:12.510 --> 06:14.633
You know I'm not familiar enough with that story.

06:14.953 --> 06:24.244
You shape somebody in your image.

06:24.494 --> 06:28.400
His image, per se, is an expression of excellence I guess.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.925
Yeah, I think that it eluded him I think.

06:32.186 --> 06:43.723
I feel you're right that when he sees the boy at first it's a little bit of an aggravation because to be reminded that this is, it reminds him of his glory days.

06:44.104 --> 06:49.472
But I think though for someone like Reinhardt, once he hears the boy play he cannot deny

06:49.722 --> 06:53.589
He can't deny the boy's talent.

06:53.649 --> 06:54.631
He's so attracted to it.

06:54.651 --> 06:55.252
It's music.

06:55.292 --> 06:56.154
It's beautiful music.

06:56.174 --> 06:57.075
He's got to help.

06:57.937 --> 07:02.405
So at least that's how I saw it.

07:02.425 --> 07:07.153
We just played the Amadeus tape again for that fifth or sixth time.

07:07.173 --> 07:12.523
And it's amazing when suddenly everybody gets, I mean he's furious on the one hand, but

07:13.718 --> 07:32.147
I think my favorite scene in that movie is when he's reading the manuscript pages and he's hearing it in his head and they finally just drop out of his hands.

07:32.448 --> 07:37.696
Actually I said to my wife, I said this is one of the great moments of movies.

07:37.896 --> 07:41.582
I think because I've very rarely seen the creative process

07:42.457 --> 07:43.799
He's playing the film.

07:43.879 --> 07:47.804
In other words, he's hearing the sounds.

07:47.844 --> 07:53.651
I can't read music, but he's dictating the requiem.

07:53.671 --> 07:56.575
He's hearing the chorus.

07:57.236 --> 08:05.466
It really is a nice visual kind of explanation I think of what happens creatively.

08:05.486 --> 08:11.234
It's not seated in any way, but I can think of it.

08:11.254 --> 08:11.434
Terrific.

08:11.802 --> 08:31.140
One thing I didn't know until I read this, and I just read the PWM interview this morning, I assume of course, obviously the photo of you, but I didn't realize that you come from a tradition, perhaps the similarities in the experience.

08:31.260 --> 08:36.285
I'm sure the character is unique, he's an imaginary character.

08:36.305 --> 08:39.548
But tell me a little bit about the influences here.

08:39.882 --> 08:42.045
Well, my mother is a concert harpsichordist.

08:42.505 --> 08:55.802
And so growing up, of course, from the time I was, as long as I can remember, I remember going to her concert, seeing her on stage, and playing that beautiful music, and also getting that applause at the end.

08:55.883 --> 09:07.898
And I think as a little kid, I took up the cello originally mainly to please, to be more like her, to please her, to do something that I knew both my parents would approve of.

09:08.519 --> 09:12.163
Do that from the beginning close.

09:12.283 --> 09:17.289
If you just hold this a little closer, you can solve it.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.191
Let me make a good beginning here.

09:21.754 --> 09:32.265
My mother is a concert harpsichordist, and so from as young as I can remember, I remember seeing her on stage playing that beautiful music.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.905
having such control, but most of all getting the applause at the end.

09:37.125 --> 09:45.436
And I think I started playing the cello when I was seven, mainly because I felt at that time that music was simply a good thing to do.

09:45.456 --> 09:56.650
It was something that would not only make my parents happy, but I knew it was something I'd approve of, and hopefully it would give me the kind of control over my life that my mother has.

09:56.984 --> 10:16.307
So one problem for me playing the cello is that for many years, right up to the time I entered college as a music major, I think I played music for the wrong reason, which is rather than playing it because I had a deep love for it, I played it because I wanted to reach the goal of being a concert musician.

10:16.947 --> 10:26.198
And once I got to college and saw the other music majors and saw how much more serious about it they were than me, that's when I decided to take Chinese.

10:27.241 --> 10:27.882
put that down.

10:27.902 --> 10:31.367
That's good, that's excellent.

10:31.888 --> 10:35.834
I think that's the one we'll lose, because it's terrific.

10:37.457 --> 10:52.219
So what's the difference between the character here and my own life is that Reinhardt's mother is not a musician, but when she sees her son as extraordinarily gifted,

10:52.469 --> 11:02.902
she devotes her life to making sure he achieves his potential, and that's a problem for Reinhardt because she takes such control over his life, he's not able to make many of his own decisions.

11:03.102 --> 11:05.405
In my case, it was completely the opposite.

11:05.765 --> 11:11.372
My mother is a musician, she's a teacher, she knows what a mistake it can be to push kids for the wrong reasons.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.557
She was always reminding me to do this

11:16.043 --> 11:17.365
only if I loved it.

11:17.746 --> 11:20.951
But I, being stubborn, I felt this was a challenge.

11:21.011 --> 11:22.013
I didn't take it literally.

11:22.093 --> 11:25.138
I thought this was her way of finding out whether I was serious or not.

11:25.198 --> 11:30.146
And the more she would say, do it for the love of it, the harder I would work to be great at it.

11:30.306 --> 11:35.154
And so that's the main difference between, oh, and also I was not a prodigy by any means.

11:35.274 --> 11:40.282
I have a good musical ear, but I was not extraordinary by any means.

11:41.123 --> 11:43.587
So I quit playing the cello once I

11:43.803 --> 12:09.844
got to college, I'd fool around with it after that, but it wasn't until I was writing this book that I picked it up again, and that's been one of the great joyful discoveries of my life, is that as I was writing this character and imagining what it would be like to play without the burden of this goal of being somebody that I wasn't, I'm describing his childhood as he's playing, and he's just really free when he's playing,

12:10.212 --> 12:21.345
It was such an enjoyable experience that one day, it was literally one afternoon, I remember thinking suddenly, what if I were to imagine the same experience and I had a cello in my hands?

12:21.445 --> 12:22.026
Would it work?

12:22.086 --> 12:30.116
So I went right to a violin shop, rented a little cello, brought it home, played for about four or five hours without stopping, and ever since then I've practiced every day now.

12:30.196 --> 12:30.917
I love it.

12:30.937 --> 12:31.998
You picked it right back up.

12:32.018 --> 12:32.558
Absolutely.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.562
It happened in one afternoon since then.

12:35.727 --> 12:36.989
It is such a source of joy.

12:37.009 --> 12:37.930
You can see that little thing.

12:37.950 --> 12:42.296
I have a portable cello I take with me in hotels, because it's so pleasant.

12:42.576 --> 12:43.838
Why'd you point that out?

12:43.858 --> 12:45.641
Go ahead, that gets in the story.

12:47.964 --> 12:50.447
Yeah, I'll have to show you that thing, because that's really ingenious.

12:50.507 --> 12:59.560
But anyway, now I do play two or three hours a day, and it's entirely different, an entirely different experience from when I was a kid.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.266
Now practice used to seem like...

13:04.465 --> 13:10.933
a grim exercise on the way toward a very attractive goal.

13:11.193 --> 13:26.231
Now, just even playing scales, just producing sounds and making slow improvements, that in itself, that kind of problem solving and that kind of the play of harmony and melody and all, it's like playing a sandbox.

13:26.331 --> 13:30.456
My wife has to literally get me to stop practicing every day and

13:30.605 --> 13:34.631
Well, it's no longer practice in the traditional sense.

13:34.651 --> 13:37.495
You're not training for something.

13:37.515 --> 13:37.876
Exactly.

13:37.896 --> 13:41.341
It's like reading for pleasure and reading because you have to, I think.

13:41.381 --> 13:42.543
Yes, that's right.

13:42.603 --> 13:44.886
I think you're doing this because it gives you pleasure.

13:45.106 --> 13:48.892
No, you're not doing it because you're hoping to get a shot with the New York Film.

13:48.912 --> 13:49.813
Yes, yes.

13:50.174 --> 13:53.258
Maybe there's that as well, but I suspect not.

13:53.358 --> 13:56.443
No, I don't think so.

13:56.677 --> 14:05.866
As you said, you went to Yale, and the intention was to be a music major, and then you got into Chinese studies.

14:05.886 --> 14:16.417
But of course there was no thought at that point about being a writer, about expressing yourself creatively through writing, which is how you've made your mark thus far.

14:16.537 --> 14:18.199
I think people will dispute that.

14:18.979 --> 14:24.625
Do you find, though, that the writing is kind of a surrogate way

14:25.280 --> 14:28.404
express yourself creatively?

14:28.424 --> 14:31.649
Well, I think, yes, I see just what you mean.

14:31.669 --> 14:34.894
As a substitute for the music, I guess, is what I'm saying.

14:34.914 --> 14:54.662
I suppose, I'm sure that in a sense that must be partially true, that I think like all of us, especially when I was a teenager, I yearned to have some creative outlet that I could do well enough that it would identify me as someone with ideas and not a complete slough off.

14:54.963 --> 15:01.373
And what worked out well about writing with me is that I didn't have writing in mind.

15:01.393 --> 15:03.336
I was sort of surprised by writing.

15:03.696 --> 15:11.728
After that experience of living in China, when I came back, it was friends' suggestions that I try writing down some of the stories there.

15:12.509 --> 15:18.979
So by having it come about sort of by accident that I discovered that I had a knack with words,

15:19.752 --> 15:41.885
I didn't have a lot of that pressure at the beginning of expectations, and so that's why I think I feel that writing has been a very enjoyable process of learning about fiction, learning how to write every day, rather than something that I'd started off very early on and struggled with unrealistic expectations that I had to get through.

15:41.925 --> 15:46.011
Again, the theme of the book, isn't it?

15:46.031 --> 15:46.131
Yeah.

15:46.448 --> 15:57.159
But let me also say, as one of those who have been writing for quite a few years, to make that leap into fiction, that's a whole other realm.

15:57.179 --> 16:11.494
To have these characters just emerge, I'm sure they don't come full blown from the mind of Salzman, but you work at them and you feel them, and there is a chemistry that's going on here, call it a creative process, whatever.

16:12.368 --> 16:22.598
There is an artistic side there that transcends the craft of writing, the art of writing and the craft of writing.

16:22.618 --> 16:34.970
And I'm impressed by, as one who lived in the vineyards for many years, it would be something that you could think about doing the problem.

16:35.090 --> 16:42.257
Well, the way I got into writing fiction was that after writing Iron and Silk, and then realizing I had a chance

16:42.743 --> 16:43.584
At a career.

16:44.145 --> 16:47.669
And at that time, I'd been just teaching martial arts in New Haven and hating it.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.933
I thought, okay, I'd better get to work on a new book.

16:51.935 --> 16:57.742
Everyone expected me to write another nonfiction, and I would have been happy to, except I didn't have anything left true to say.

16:57.782 --> 16:59.384
You're pushing 30 at this point.

16:59.404 --> 16:59.965
Yeah, yeah.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.707
And I didn't have any other stories.

17:01.827 --> 17:03.589
And also, I'm not an adventurer.

17:03.810 --> 17:11.299
I didn't feel like getting on a plane and going to some new, uncomfortable place and having another experience just so I could write a book about it.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.580
So I felt a little bit backed into a corner.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.823
I felt fiction was the only way to go.

17:15.883 --> 17:34.670
And so, in a sense, what was motivating me, I think, was the sense that this is probably, realistically, the only direction that I can take where I can stay at home every day and not have to... Yeah, so... Why did you move out to L.A., just out of curiosity?

17:35.551 --> 17:38.636
My wife makes documentary films.

17:39.056 --> 17:40.138
And also, she's from...

17:40.355 --> 17:41.717
California from the Bay Area.

17:42.097 --> 17:43.058
We lived there for a year.

17:43.118 --> 17:51.528
I loved it, but there really wasn't any chance for her to work, so then we moved down, and oh, she loves it.

17:51.648 --> 17:56.193
She's ecstatic in Los Angeles, and her enthusiasm has rubbed off on me.

17:56.653 --> 18:01.118
I kind of went dragging my heels, because I'd only visited Los Angeles once before.

18:01.198 --> 18:01.799
I hated it.

18:01.859 --> 18:02.700
I remember saying,

18:02.967 --> 18:07.075
Well, at least this is one place I know I'll never have to worry about, you know, wish that I lived there.

18:07.095 --> 18:07.516
Here you are.

18:07.576 --> 18:15.330
And now I live there, and I think once you make friends with a few people that you like, then it's all over.

18:15.350 --> 18:15.931
It's home.

18:16.011 --> 18:23.485
I've lived in the Bay Area for a number of years, but I've never liked L.A.

18:23.505 --> 18:23.806
and down there.

18:23.826 --> 18:26.511
But I have to say that while researching this book,

18:28.145 --> 18:29.827
spending some time out there with my wife.

18:29.847 --> 18:30.767
We love it.

18:30.787 --> 18:32.809
Well, we spent a lot of time in the Huntington Library.

18:33.130 --> 18:34.551
Oh, yeah.

18:34.571 --> 18:40.216
Yeah, you go to the garden.

18:40.857 --> 18:42.778
How did they make out the earthquake?

18:42.798 --> 18:45.220
I heard that they were fine and no trouble there.

18:46.261 --> 18:52.587
And also the Getty, they say they had no, the only thing that broke was a reproduction of fake statue they had in the coffee shop.

18:52.707 --> 18:53.908
That's good.

18:53.988 --> 18:56.491
I'm sure that they constructed that.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.932
Of course, it's on a hill here.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.031
Yeah.

19:01.293 --> 19:03.656
How about yourself?

19:03.676 --> 19:04.797
Any earthquake experience that you relate to?

19:04.817 --> 19:06.059
We frozen eastern?

19:06.079 --> 19:11.465
Yeah, well, it was pretty shocking because we are in the valley and not too far from it.

19:11.605 --> 19:17.432
And it was so powerful that when I kind of woke up, I was halfway across the room.

19:17.492 --> 19:20.836
I'm not sure how I got there, so I think I got shaken right out of bed.

19:21.416 --> 19:25.020
We had things tossed around, but luckily no structural damage.

19:25.040 --> 19:25.641
But the most

19:26.448 --> 19:31.895
The interesting part about it, I felt, was that the aftershocks were coming every two or three minutes of scenes.

19:32.536 --> 19:36.801
And our cats managed to, you know, we looked for them all day, couldn't find them.

19:37.041 --> 19:41.066
Finally, I looked under the bed and saw a giant gash under the box spring.

19:41.427 --> 19:46.313
They had slashed open the box spring and both jumped up in there and dug their claws into the springs.

19:46.715 --> 19:49.758
They wound up like little balls and we managed to coax them out.

19:50.078 --> 19:55.143
And their tails were wound so tight between their legs that they were right under their chins, tickling their noses.

19:55.484 --> 19:58.987
And we were trying to lift them out.

19:59.167 --> 20:09.197
We flew down in Florida last year for the AVA.

20:09.217 --> 20:11.980
We went out to the Everglades just for a little day trip.

20:12.398 --> 20:17.787
And this was shortly after Hurricane Andrew and the woman for the National Park Association.

20:17.807 --> 20:18.408
It's amazing.

20:18.548 --> 20:20.472
The animals really survived it.

20:21.293 --> 20:23.577
We came in expecting to find all these dead animals.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.964
They found trees and everything and the structures and so on, but the animals were fine.

20:28.946 --> 20:35.117
So there's something in there that's instinctive that they can prepare themselves.

20:36.559 --> 20:38.322
By the way, what's your schedule?

20:38.487 --> 20:42.553
Oh, you know, the appointment after this was put off a half an hour, so we're fine.

20:42.593 --> 20:42.954
Okay.

20:42.994 --> 20:44.897
I've got lots of stuff here.

20:46.359 --> 20:47.761
Let's give it another 15 minutes.

20:47.781 --> 20:48.202
Is that okay?

20:48.222 --> 20:49.184
That's perfectly fine.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.808
We did talk about your mother.

20:51.868 --> 21:03.125
We talked about the plane.

21:03.506 --> 21:03.906
The astronaut train.

21:03.926 --> 21:04.427
I knew that was right.

21:04.762 --> 21:06.546
Oh, the box?

21:07.027 --> 21:08.250
That's absolutely true.

21:09.332 --> 21:10.875
I used to sit in this box.

21:11.477 --> 21:24.525
And the funny thing about it is that I had, which I don't know if I put that in the novel or not, but I had this little simple periscope with two mirrors, and to wait a clock off time was to watch all the afternoon programs, you know, sitting in this little box.

21:25.062 --> 21:30.689
Oh, yeah, especially the mothers that would drop off their kids for my mother to teach, you know, where's your son?

21:30.849 --> 21:31.850
Oh, he's in his box.

21:33.652 --> 21:34.854
He's so well-behaved.

21:36.496 --> 21:44.426
When you think of things that you did and things that you didn't do, I mean, would you like to be a pilot?

21:44.446 --> 21:54.698
Well, as it turns out, I think now, no, because I'm really, I'm not a very, I'm very much a coward rather than an adventurer.

21:54.982 --> 21:58.085
I like routine.

21:58.145 --> 22:04.751
I like the safety of comfortable routines, and that allows me then to have my flights of fancy.

22:05.972 --> 22:12.618
But what I liked about the whole thing of training for an astronaut is I guess I tend to be a bit obsessive.

22:13.258 --> 22:20.725
I love to get obsessed with a task and to get so involved with it, to be so passionate about it that nothing can distract me.

22:20.885 --> 22:23.908
And that's, I think, what I liked about the idea of being in a little box

22:24.142 --> 22:34.394
going out in space is that I like being challenged by limitations and having to focus and not lose sight of what's going on.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.056
That, I think, is what attracted me.

22:37.018 --> 22:43.405
Plus, my dad, being an amateur astronomer, we used to go out every night with the telescope.

22:43.906 --> 22:49.052
Then he gave me his old telescope after they retired, so I liked to stargaze a lot.

22:49.285 --> 22:56.992
I guess I just am really attracted to the sort of chilling feeling you get when you're looking at objects that are unimaginably distant.

22:57.113 --> 23:01.657
I know that book that you mentioned, that book of the photographs from space.

23:01.677 --> 23:02.217
Oh, yeah.

23:03.058 --> 23:03.699
Oh, yes.

23:04.119 --> 23:10.726
And that quote from the Soviet, the Russian guy, the incredible silence.

23:10.806 --> 23:15.310
I spent crossing the Pacific on this aircraft carrier a number of times.

23:15.880 --> 23:23.572
being out there, literally in the middle of the ocean, and thinking how you really get to see the sky.

23:23.753 --> 23:28.580
It's like going up to Maine.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.021
There's no pollution.

23:29.041 --> 23:33.288
I remember thinking how silent it was, how fast, how magnificent.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.673
And then to take it to that next step, to actually walk out

23:36.890 --> 23:42.416
It must be, you can hear his blood going on.

23:42.436 --> 23:48.363
I can see with that, it was a wonderful little image there.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.965
It was a very familiar book.

23:50.265 --> 23:51.187
What are you working on?

23:51.207 --> 23:53.429
This could make a heck of a movie, I think, as well.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.431
Have you optioned this?

23:55.552 --> 23:56.393
No, not yet.

23:57.073 --> 24:04.602
I hope someone does, of course, because it's sort of a sad, but

24:04.767 --> 24:16.701
But the fortunate thing is that a writer can often make a better living just from optioning his books than from all the sales and advances altogether, even if it's not made.

24:16.801 --> 24:20.986
So I'm hoping it gets options so that I can afford to write the next one.

24:21.526 --> 24:28.935
Because frankly, the sale of a book, no matter how good it does, really you can't pay your bills from writing.

24:29.168 --> 24:29.729
We'll see.

24:29.969 --> 24:30.970
But I'm glad you said it.

24:30.990 --> 24:32.392
I think it would make a nice movie.

24:32.432 --> 24:36.457
Well it's good drive, and it's just got a story, which is important.

24:36.497 --> 24:44.607
Characters that you can identify with, just looking at it.

24:44.728 --> 24:47.111
It's a very nice movie.

24:47.331 --> 24:50.715
The tour, your promotion tour, is how big?

24:50.735 --> 24:52.237
I know it's the only thing about eight cities.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.198
I'm surprised at that.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.920
Well let's see, they've added on a couple.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.724
It's altogether a little bit under three weeks.

24:58.582 --> 25:07.973
Which is fine, I think, for me, because that's about my limit, I think, before I get so homesick and then I really, oh, I want to go back to my own routine.

25:08.013 --> 25:11.397
Now, you're reading today at Borders, I think.

25:11.417 --> 25:11.697
That's right.

25:11.737 --> 25:12.878
Now, what do you read?

25:13.699 --> 25:28.116
Actually, what I do is I usually read a very, I try to choose something extremely brief because I don't like, I don't enjoy hearing people read aloud very much, so I don't

25:28.450 --> 25:29.835
I don't feel I do it well to others.

25:29.855 --> 25:36.058
So what I do is actually, I just tell the story of how I got to writing this book, what interested me about it.

25:36.078 --> 25:38.386
I like to tell a story about that conversation in the car.

25:38.968 --> 25:40.333
So I try to make it

25:40.651 --> 25:42.154
a little bit more than just a reading.

25:42.234 --> 25:46.624
I try to make it an opportunity for them to hear, you know, why did this guy write this book?

25:46.644 --> 25:48.888
And what personal experience does he have?

25:48.908 --> 25:50.452
So that's generally what I do.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.256
Could you read one twenty-second thing?

25:53.037 --> 25:54.440
Just see what happens.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.645
Maybe I can use it, you know.

25:56.765 --> 25:57.767
I'm really excited about this.

25:57.887 --> 26:00.112
I'm giving these guys three segments as well.

26:00.132 --> 26:01.495
Oh, okay.

26:02.875 --> 26:11.206
I'm giving them this Gershwin song book.

26:11.226 --> 26:17.094
The Ira Gershwin lyrics, a big book that did 700 lyrics to all the songs.

26:17.514 --> 26:22.180
I call it a time capsule of the book.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.823
Give them a selection of things.

26:24.584 --> 26:29.490
Let's see, you're thinking about 20, 30 seconds or so?

26:29.707 --> 26:36.077
I'm just thinking, let's try something, and if I can use it when I put the thing together this afternoon, I'll use it.

26:36.097 --> 26:36.397
All right.

26:36.497 --> 26:45.471
Well, maybe one part I like is the part of it where Reinhardt and his teacher see the lunar eclipse, and the old teacher says, you know, is that all right?

26:45.491 --> 26:45.591
Yeah.

26:50.458 --> 26:55.866
One winter afternoon in Ederstasi, just after my eleventh birthday, my cello teacher

26:56.116 --> 27:02.483
Von Kempen asked my mother and me to stay on for a while after the lesson to see what he called a celestial performance.

27:03.264 --> 27:15.458
When the grandfather clock upstairs in his music room struck five o'clock, the three of us looked out the bay windows over his garden and saw the full moon, newly risen over the reservoir, glowing a dull copperish red.

27:15.478 --> 27:19.963
"'Mundfinsternis,' he said reverently, "'a lunar eclipse.'

27:20.770 --> 27:29.101
I asked what this meant, and he explained that the sun, the earth, and the moon were now perfectly aligned, so that the moon was now entirely in the earth's shadow.

27:29.361 --> 27:31.484
It could receive no direct light from the sun.

27:32.445 --> 27:33.606
So why can we still see it?

27:33.727 --> 27:34.067
I asked.

27:35.028 --> 27:45.722
The old master looked genuinely puzzled and limped over to his desk, where he picked up a newspaper and held it under a light, and using a huge magnifying glass read what was apparently a brief article about the eclipse.

27:46.643 --> 27:49.647
Ah yes, dear boy, such a fine inquiring mind!

27:49.947 --> 27:58.637
The paper tells us that the moon receives a bit of indirect sunlight thanks to our own Earth's atmosphere, which deflects the light and sends some of it toward the moon.

27:59.799 --> 28:10.452
In spite of the moon's diminished brightness, I could see details on its surface more clearly than I ever had before, perhaps for the same reason that distant trees and mountains look sharper when seen through darkened glasses.

28:11.453 --> 28:15.378
Von Kempen returned to the window to admire the scene further, then chuckled to himself.

28:15.998 --> 28:19.903
"'I just thought of something,' he said, opening a fresh can of blended tobacco."

28:20.339 --> 28:22.481
The moon and I, we have something in common.

28:22.901 --> 28:23.882
Can you guess what it is?

28:23.922 --> 28:26.325
No, I can't, Herr Professor.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.266
Oh, come, take a guess at least.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.229
I could never think quickly when put on the spot.

28:31.630 --> 28:37.075
My mind went blank, but to satisfy my expectant teacher I blurted out, You both have reddish faces?

28:38.076 --> 28:40.838
The old cellist laughed out loud, but my mother was horrified.

28:40.938 --> 28:43.261
What a thing to say, she said loudly in English.

28:43.961 --> 28:47.865
Thankfully, von Kempen leaped to my defense before she could scold me any further.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.473
Not at all, mein Liebfrau Sundheimer.

28:50.733 --> 28:55.440
The young maestro is quite right, but I was thinking of something else.

28:55.460 --> 28:59.325
He lit his pipe, puffed at it dreamily, and then laughed quietly once again.

28:59.345 --> 29:02.729
I am still visible because of you.

29:02.990 --> 29:04.612
That is why I am like the moon.

29:05.053 --> 29:07.296
How fortunate I am that you play the cello.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.581
That was 270 and 271.

29:11.641 --> 29:12.483
Excellent.

29:15.727 --> 29:15.827
Okay.

29:16.465 --> 29:20.070
You're from Connecticut now, just a little biographical background.

29:20.090 --> 29:24.217
Yeah, small town in Connecticut, Bridgefield.

29:25.559 --> 29:35.454
So I lived in Connecticut all together 25 years, because I went to school there, of course, at Yale, and then after Yale stayed on for three more years in New Haven.

29:36.555 --> 29:42.184
So I've lived in Connecticut for 25 years, China for two, and now California for six, I guess.

29:42.204 --> 29:42.945
Six years?

29:43.027 --> 29:47.585
Yeah, let's see, 87 to now, this is our seventh year.

29:49.252 --> 29:52.847
Okay, listen, I'm going to, in fact, would you inscribe this for me?

29:52.867 --> 29:53.188
Oh, yeah.
