WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:24.081
This is basically the first major piece I bought on my own and my husband thought it was next.

00:24.787 --> 00:26.530
Now he doesn't, obviously.

00:27.531 --> 00:32.679
Charles Maltby was a friend of Abraham Lincoln's, and they lived in New Salem.

00:32.739 --> 00:33.540
That's where they met.

00:34.382 --> 00:39.570
And later on, Lincoln appointed him in charge of Indian affairs in California.

00:40.551 --> 00:46.701
And so Mrs. Maltby, when she was in Washington, brought three copies.

00:46.961 --> 00:53.511
And these lithographs were done by a 14-year-old lithographer in San Francisco.

00:53.761 --> 01:18.975
name i think it's butler and lincoln signed them one is in this one is the best copy of it and i would assume it's the first one he signed because you could see he pressed too hard and it just did that and the others aren't like that this is a one of three this one was given to cornelius cole who was a senator in california

01:19.580 --> 01:25.426
The other one was given to Maltby, and it's in the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History.

01:25.746 --> 01:31.052
And there's one more that I heard a dealer has in Washington, D.C.

01:31.913 --> 01:36.978
And mine is supposed to be in the best condition because you see the flag and the colors and everything.

01:37.619 --> 01:44.486
The one in the museum is all the flag, the colors are faded, and likewise with the one in Washington.

01:44.506 --> 01:47.629
So this is de-emancipation, or did you say the California?

01:47.930 --> 01:51.273
the California Emancipation Proclamation.

01:53.075 --> 02:03.024
But it is one of three, so it makes it much rarer, people are beginning to realize, than the ones where there were 52, and now there's 28 existing.

02:04.906 --> 02:07.408
And let's see, these are slave bills.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.129
They just wanted two different types.

02:09.189 --> 02:13.513
This one says the slaves, and this one says Negroes.

02:13.674 --> 02:17.397
But the one that is unique about this one

02:17.680 --> 02:25.110
It's from Hardin County, Kentucky, which was Lincoln's birth town.

02:25.130 --> 02:36.105
And this is a piece of the coat that Lincoln was wearing when he was shot.

02:37.347 --> 02:38.789
And that's the document.

02:38.809 --> 02:47.080
It came from Reverend Gurley, who was the one that, I guess he did the funeral services and was there.

02:48.089 --> 02:50.933
And it's attested to it and said, what were thinking were key?

02:51.374 --> 02:53.797
This came out of a private collection.

02:53.817 --> 02:55.940
I wonder how he got it.

02:55.961 --> 02:57.563
Did he take it to order?

02:57.763 --> 03:01.429
Because isn't most of the code with the... No.

03:02.610 --> 03:06.376
The code is in Ford's Theater in the basement in the museum.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.622
But from what I'm told, part of it was put back together.

03:11.163 --> 03:13.426
But there are several pieces of it.

03:14.788 --> 03:17.472
That's a eulogy on a Lincoln book plate.

03:18.008 --> 03:21.933
written by Thomas Edison on Abraham Lincoln.

03:24.577 --> 03:32.487
This is another reverse glass of the summer home, the soldier's home that the Lincolns went to when the weather got real hot.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.791
They'd leave the city and go and stay there.

03:36.813 --> 03:44.623
And then, that's a morning silk in New York City for the funeral.

03:44.823 --> 03:50.731
And that's a gauge bronze.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.937
These are just nothing, you know, pickup things.

03:55.117 --> 04:00.344
I mean, they're unique and rare, but they're not of much value.

04:02.968 --> 04:08.756
This is an invitation that the Lincolns sent out for people to come.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.159
I forget who they were invited.

04:12.601 --> 04:14.644
March 1, 1864.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.041
for the White House.

04:16.402 --> 04:19.707
President and Mrs. Licken at home Tuesday evening, March 20th.

04:20.468 --> 04:24.915
I'm sorry, Andrea.

04:24.935 --> 04:28.401
I get off track every single time.

04:28.421 --> 04:31.245
This is fine.

04:32.827 --> 04:42.302
But in collecting, we collect antiques, 18th century English, and some 17th century, and some American pieces, mostly English.

04:44.105 --> 04:47.810
I saw an ad in an antique paper, and I saw these two portraits.

04:48.491 --> 04:50.955
And it said, Mr. and Mrs. Salmon Chase.

04:51.816 --> 04:53.599
And I liked them.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.563
Ended up, it's a long story, but I ended up buying them.

04:57.444 --> 05:03.894
And they are the original portraits of Salmon Chase and his first wife, Catherine.

05:03.934 --> 05:13.808
And they were painted by two painters, Samuel, but they were called Waldo and Jewett.

05:14.497 --> 05:17.461
Samuel, Lovett, Waldo, and William Jewett.

05:17.882 --> 05:23.390
One of them painted the hands and the face, and the other one painted the clothing.

05:24.472 --> 05:29.239
And the unique thing about it is they got married.

05:29.479 --> 05:34.006
Eight months later, she had a baby and died giving birth to the baby.

05:35.007 --> 05:39.754
So here he is, without a wife, a little baby.

05:40.355 --> 05:43.660
He starts to raise the baby and meets another woman and marries her.

05:44.720 --> 06:10.339
then she's helping to raise this baby the baby dies then this second woman the second wife has a baby and he makes her name the baby after the first wife the baby of the second life was kate chase who was mary lincoln's arch enemy in washington she was like the belle of washington in the 1860s and

06:11.315 --> 06:25.330
She wanted her father to become president, so they were like... And he became, he was a chief justice, and he was secretary of the treasury.

06:26.771 --> 06:31.316
So I bought them because I felt they were good looking.

06:31.536 --> 06:36.922
They've been offered, I heard, to the Chase Manhattan Bank, and the curator said we only collect contemporary art now.

06:40.406 --> 06:40.866
That's great.

06:47.714 --> 06:49.516
Do you want to see certain things?

06:49.917 --> 06:50.017
Sure.

06:50.037 --> 06:55.544
Anything you want to show me, sure.

06:55.564 --> 06:57.206
Do you mind, Louise, if I take a few pictures?

06:57.967 --> 06:59.168
Does that bother you?

06:59.188 --> 06:59.288
Yeah.

06:59.549 --> 06:59.889
Okay.

06:59.909 --> 07:02.532
But I don't, yeah, kind of.

07:03.394 --> 07:06.177
Let's wait, I think, for it.

07:08.880 --> 07:14.387
Because then people might see what, you know, what it is or whatever.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.451
These spoons, you can see, say...

07:18.258 --> 07:21.562
They belonged to Ninian and Elizabeth Edwards.

07:21.622 --> 07:32.313
Elizabeth Edwards was Mary Lincoln's sister, and it was in the Edwards home that the Lincolns were married, and supposedly the spoons were used at the wedding.

07:34.515 --> 07:40.662
And that's Mary Lincoln's letter opener, and I don't know what you call that.

07:40.742 --> 07:48.130
It's like a little date thing made out of ivory.

07:48.920 --> 07:56.191
And then these two pieces of marble, this piece is from, have you ever been to Springfield?

07:56.211 --> 07:56.292
No.

07:56.332 --> 08:03.463
Okay, in Springfield, there was the first, you'll see pictures, there was a holding vault before they built the big tomb.

08:04.124 --> 08:06.828
And this is a piece of marble from the holding vault.

08:07.770 --> 08:16.243
And this is a piece of marble that was on the table, that the casket was on, on the train that went from Washington back to Springfield.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.086
and the marble broke.

08:19.786 --> 08:22.289
So a few people got souvenir pieces.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.733
Supposedly this is the only one in existence.

08:26.794 --> 08:30.438
This is the cufflink button that Lincoln had on.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.281
The other one is in the Library of Congress.

08:33.942 --> 08:37.105
You mean the night of the assassination?

08:37.125 --> 08:39.608
And that's a piece of the lead.

08:39.628 --> 08:41.570
There's two pieces.

08:41.590 --> 08:45.454
That piece that was kept by the man that cut open

08:45.687 --> 08:48.211
the coffin before Lincoln was finally buried.

08:48.251 --> 08:53.961
They had to view the body to make sure before they put all the concrete in the wire.

08:53.981 --> 08:59.571
And that was his piece, and there's another piece that's about this big.

08:59.671 --> 09:03.177
It's in the library in Springfield, Illinois.

09:04.459 --> 09:11.391
And then in here, I have a tea napkin and a handkerchief from Mary Lincoln, and she monogrammed the M on it.

09:12.485 --> 09:23.441
And these are the carte de visite in a lock of hair of Mary Lincoln, carte de visite of Willie in his hair, and Abraham in his hair.

09:24.243 --> 09:29.270
And then that's a piece of Meissen china from Hildene that was Robert Lincoln's.

09:30.152 --> 09:41.108
And then that china is of the period and is the pattern that the Lincolns used in their home in Springfield, but it did not belong to the Lincolns.

09:41.662 --> 09:45.466
Did you acquire those three items separately?

09:45.486 --> 09:48.068
These were together from a collector.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.292
And then, that's Abraham Lincoln's billfold.

09:52.273 --> 09:52.873
That's great.

09:57.958 --> 10:09.390
What he would do, supposedly, a billfold was if he was on the circuit and did some work for someone and there was an IOU, he would put it into the slot

10:09.775 --> 10:16.103
that they owed him, just a little note, and when he got back home, then I guess he would put it in a ledger.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.926
What do you call this part of it?

10:18.126 --> 10:19.908
Well, this is not the manuscript.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.430
No, artifacts.

10:21.450 --> 10:22.512
This is artifacts, yeah.

10:23.012 --> 10:26.417
This is a sash, a pallbearer sash from Springfield, Illinois.

10:28.780 --> 10:39.073
This is Abraham Lincoln's handkerchief with the A monogrammed by Mary, and then

10:39.222 --> 10:41.464
The three bottles there and that bottle.

10:41.584 --> 10:43.466
The one laying down is a snuff bottle.

10:44.287 --> 10:48.952
The two on the side of the middle one are the ink bottles.

10:49.753 --> 10:53.176
And the center one is Abraham Lincoln's cough medicine bottle.

10:53.516 --> 10:59.883
And they were all from the Lincoln-Hurndon Law Office.

10:59.903 --> 11:02.185
They were found between the flooring.

11:02.205 --> 11:05.729
There was a flooring put over the original flooring.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.409
Look at the hat.

11:06.790 --> 11:09.112
And that's Abraham Lincoln's hat.

11:09.132 --> 11:09.212
Wow.

11:09.412 --> 11:11.575
And his glasses.

11:13.437 --> 11:15.219
This is pretty impressive.

11:15.499 --> 11:18.443
And then this is the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and they're signed.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.365
It is signed.

11:22.447 --> 11:23.288
By Lincoln and Douglas?

11:23.569 --> 11:26.052
No, they never both signed them.

11:26.732 --> 11:29.756
If someone had one, I don't know what the price would be.

11:29.796 --> 11:30.517
They never did.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.518
This is signed by whom?

11:31.578 --> 11:35.723
This is signed by Lincoln and came from the Doheny collection.

11:35.872 --> 11:46.967
The hat, the glasses, and the billfold were on the Freedom Train around the United States, and Governor Thompson of Illinois took the three of them on a tour of China.

11:48.088 --> 11:51.813
So we have all these brochures in Chinese with Abraham Lincoln.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.076
The hat is really something.

11:54.657 --> 11:59.083
And then, yes, I'll open the show again.

12:00.605 --> 12:03.128
That's a piece of flooring from the Lincoln Home.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.497
That's an extraordinary case, but I don't think as well.

12:13.522 --> 12:18.588
Look at the spectacles on it.

12:18.608 --> 12:28.678
I gather that photograph, this picture... That's just really a postcard from one of the sites in Springfield, but it shows the hat.

12:28.718 --> 12:36.085
You can see they used one of these real tall ones, and you can see it wasn't quite that tall.

12:36.385 --> 12:43.893
is one of the pairs of gloves that Mary Lincoln had when she bought hundreds and hundreds of gloves.

12:44.454 --> 12:45.375
These were never worn.

12:46.456 --> 12:48.058
I have some upstairs that she wore.

12:48.398 --> 12:53.383
And this ivory and lace parasol was hers.

12:54.084 --> 12:58.909
And I would suppose this was one of her mourning parasols because of the black.

12:59.710 --> 13:05.076
And then this is a book that had been given to her and obviously used when they were in Washington.

13:05.292 --> 13:33.325
washington described mrs a lincoln she didn't sign it but it was her book all about washington so and you could see with the guilt around it so it was a very special copy and then this is a presentation copy from mary lincoln to tad her son but it's because the association i don't know that is

13:35.431 --> 13:41.099
She writes and it's presented to Thomas Lincoln by his mother December 25, 1867.

13:41.159 --> 13:43.322
So it was a Christmas present.

13:43.342 --> 13:43.962
And what is the book?

13:44.603 --> 13:48.929
It's part of the Soldier Boy series.

13:48.969 --> 13:50.371
You'll see I have more of them.

13:50.611 --> 13:53.395
There was a whole series of these books.

13:55.358 --> 14:00.064
That's about as good a Lincoln Association copy as you can get.

14:00.084 --> 14:03.008
I have a lot of books.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.194
What are these?

14:05.815 --> 14:07.136
This is interesting.

14:07.236 --> 14:18.488
It's Staffordshire that they made, and I guess when Abraham Lincoln was president, the English just put A. Lincoln.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.691
I've seen very few of them.

14:21.771 --> 14:23.333
I was lucky to get them.

14:23.353 --> 14:24.774
These are all Staffordshire, too.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.797
John Brown, Uncle Tom, Little Eva.

14:27.978 --> 14:31.341
And this was produced during Lincoln's lifetime?

14:32.266 --> 14:33.247
That I don't know.

14:33.267 --> 14:34.469
I don't know too much about it.

14:34.509 --> 14:37.153
All I know is I saw it somewhere and had to have it.

14:37.594 --> 14:39.196
And one day I saw one and got it.

14:39.977 --> 14:50.953
General Grant's pocketbook.

14:51.354 --> 14:51.654
Right.

14:52.055 --> 14:53.757
Grant's memoirs, of course.

14:53.777 --> 14:54.719
We get sidetracked.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.684
The pocketbook's inside that case, and it's real fragile.

14:58.705 --> 15:01.108
And he signed the inside of the pocketbook.

15:08.294 --> 15:11.998
a pastel on linen of Edwin Booth.

15:16.922 --> 15:21.767
And these were all Edwin's ticket to a theater that he owned.

15:25.070 --> 15:29.054
The greatest American Shakespearean actor ever.

15:29.074 --> 15:34.079
And this is the, that's John Wilkes Booth's father.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.963
And this is the ticket that was in his pocket

15:38.213 --> 15:40.176
He died.

15:40.196 --> 15:43.701
He died on a boat, a steamship.

15:43.721 --> 15:45.683
Passage ticket from New Orleans to Cincinnati.

15:47.346 --> 15:51.892
Found in this person after his death in Arbitrary of 1852.

15:51.912 --> 15:59.683
And then, if you could see, that's, there's a few hairs of John Maxwell.

16:00.804 --> 16:04.189
I usually don't keep much proof of that.

16:04.209 --> 16:06.212
And this is Edwin.

16:08.791 --> 16:11.536
This is a playbill of Edwin's.

16:11.556 --> 16:13.058
How did you get so interested in Edwin?

16:13.238 --> 16:17.205
I bought, that's the collection I bought because I didn't want it broken up.

16:17.766 --> 16:20.070
And that's an oil painting of Edwin of Hamlet.

16:21.332 --> 16:23.716
And then this is one of his Hamlet costumes.

16:23.756 --> 16:26.220
It's magnificent.

16:27.262 --> 16:30.327
I've seen some of his at the Players Club and this is like this.

16:31.420 --> 16:35.143
I'm on the library board of the players.

16:35.163 --> 16:35.504
You told me that.

16:35.524 --> 16:36.244
Yeah, that's exciting.

16:36.264 --> 16:39.367
This is a study for a painting that supposedly wasn't done.

16:39.407 --> 16:40.809
It was very young here.

16:40.829 --> 16:43.231
I think it was in, I forget, 1850-something.

16:45.393 --> 16:52.620
And these are three views from the old state capitol.

16:52.680 --> 16:58.385
So there are three streets that surround it, the old state capitol in Springfield.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.567
And I've got to have it.

17:00.918 --> 17:13.297
marked, but this is the bank that he kept his money at, and let's see.

17:13.317 --> 17:17.243
Okay, here's the law office, the court.

17:18.024 --> 17:19.707
This was the farmer's bank.

17:19.767 --> 17:25.035
This one's a real famous photograph, and you see it in all the different books.

17:25.943 --> 17:28.626
Is this a contemporary print?

17:29.087 --> 17:31.650
Of the period, yes.

17:31.670 --> 17:34.573
It's a photograph made right at the time.

17:34.593 --> 17:36.976
An original.

17:40.259 --> 17:46.106
This is Brady's photography box.

17:46.326 --> 17:46.567
Wow.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.630
Matthew Brady's photography box.

17:50.892 --> 17:53.014
And then these are just unique

17:53.872 --> 18:23.642
china pieces that i picked up a lincoln paperweight this is an illinois watch company put out a lincoln watch and on the back of it it says a lincoln illinois watch company and the people in illinois they get these they get really excited it's a big deal to have it and i got the sample salesman's copy this is a civil war necklace of buttons made up from the uniform the center one's confederate and the rest are union these are just plain

18:25.478 --> 18:32.948
This is the Lincoln room, I gather.

18:33.729 --> 18:43.602
Let me turn more lights.

18:47.407 --> 18:49.309
The clock from the Lincoln room in the office.

18:53.238 --> 18:57.183
That's H-E-R-N-D-O-N, and that was also in Springfield, is that right?

18:59.245 --> 19:03.891
That's a campaign ticket.

19:03.911 --> 19:09.858
This is a daybed that was made by Thomas Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's father.

19:11.900 --> 19:21.692
It was made in 1808.

19:22.145 --> 19:26.272
I should prepare myself someday, my chance will come.

19:26.292 --> 19:31.100
Oh, that's what I got when I got my own redacted.

19:31.120 --> 19:39.333
That, it was in Springfield, I guess it's like a campaign flag that was used by the Wide Awakes.

19:40.094 --> 19:44.862
And that flag didn't go with this, but this is what they use.

19:45.061 --> 19:52.292
a flag similar to that was like nailed on and there was oil in there and they lit it up and at night they'd march and campaign.

19:55.196 --> 20:00.043
That's a picture of the writers all together that did Sandberg's Lincoln for David Walter.

20:01.726 --> 20:11.220
Do you work for that?

20:12.972 --> 20:16.497
These are the mask, the bulk mask and hands.

20:18.160 --> 20:26.692
These were actually used, as I understand it, when they created the Lincoln Memorial, the monument, they used these hands, I think, isn't that right?

20:27.453 --> 20:31.539
As a model for the... I don't know.

20:31.559 --> 20:32.320
I don't know.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.943
I don't know.

20:34.003 --> 20:36.246
Those hands are very important.

20:36.266 --> 20:37.528
These hands here...

20:38.302 --> 20:40.424
We saw that at the Master's Coral Society.

20:40.444 --> 20:41.405
That's exactly right.

20:41.425 --> 20:42.686
We saw it a couple of weeks ago.

20:42.706 --> 20:43.226
They had that.

20:43.567 --> 20:45.028
There's more than one set.

20:45.048 --> 20:52.014
There's a lot of sets, but you can see the finer sets have more definition in the sculpture.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.916
But my point is these were used when they created the Lincoln.

20:55.076 --> 20:55.737
These are the hands.

20:55.777 --> 21:00.161
If you go to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, those are the hands you can see.

21:00.321 --> 21:01.662
I mean, obviously much larger.

21:02.743 --> 21:04.384
He actually used those hands.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.086
I didn't know it either.

21:06.106 --> 21:07.347
We just heard that.

21:07.495 --> 21:13.000
And let's see.

21:13.020 --> 21:20.186
It's just different sculptures by different people.

21:20.206 --> 21:23.509
That's Stephen Douglas.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.433
This is a Mary Lincoln's nightcap.

21:29.734 --> 21:31.095
These are her undergarments.

21:32.736 --> 21:34.298
And those are her gloves.

21:34.318 --> 21:37.080
I think she wore those to one of the inaugurations.

21:38.782 --> 21:43.189
Is that a Civil War chess set?

21:43.249 --> 21:45.733
I saw it recently in a mail order catalog.

21:46.394 --> 21:50.560
You could see Abraham and Mary Lincoln on this side and Grant.

21:52.343 --> 21:54.806
Jefferson Davis on the other side.

21:56.309 --> 21:56.669
Right.

21:56.689 --> 21:57.470
Let's see.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.293
Oh, this is interesting.

21:59.313 --> 22:05.062
This is the Council Award, but the thing that makes this one unique is this one belonged to Robert Lincoln.

22:05.442 --> 22:06.544
What do we call it again?

22:06.642 --> 22:07.783
The Council of War.

22:07.803 --> 22:08.964
The Council of War.

22:08.984 --> 22:15.110
And it was in Hilding, and Robert Lincoln kept it, someone said like 30 years.

22:15.310 --> 22:15.510
Right.

22:16.831 --> 22:18.152
Right next to him.

22:18.533 --> 22:19.774
Who executed this?

22:21.255 --> 22:22.076
John Rogers.

22:22.376 --> 22:25.339
Wasn't it John Rogers?

22:25.359 --> 22:36.649
And they were all done in plaster, but in some of the Lincoln letterpresses we found in Springfield, it says that Robert, when he was in Chicago,

22:37.085 --> 22:42.552
took it to someone on Wabash Avenue and had this bronze coating put over it.

22:44.093 --> 22:46.216
That's right.

22:46.236 --> 22:49.780
This is Grant to Lincoln's right, is that right?

22:50.081 --> 22:50.841
And Stanton.

22:50.861 --> 22:51.722
And Stanton to his left.

22:53.164 --> 23:05.058
And then, um... Tell me what you've seen now.

23:05.078 --> 23:06.400
This is all...

23:07.240 --> 23:09.743
Bulk's sculpture.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.066
It's the only one in marble of the hand.

23:13.047 --> 23:20.315
And these, I'll just open it so you can get a better look.

23:20.376 --> 23:22.218
These are really unique.

23:22.258 --> 23:23.619
Not many people have anything.

23:24.040 --> 23:30.087
If you want to come around this side.

23:30.107 --> 23:31.729
This is White House China.

23:31.979 --> 23:35.963
But this is the China the Lincolns ordered.

23:36.083 --> 23:42.530
They ordered this for the White House, and they ordered a set for themselves, and they were taking a long time to come.

23:42.650 --> 23:47.355
So Mary Lincoln wrote all these letters, where's my China, where's my China, drove them crazy.

23:47.455 --> 23:57.025
So to be nice, they made her a tiny set of the pink China, and this is the terrine.

23:57.680 --> 24:08.294
And then this is Robert Lincoln's sterling silver toothpick holder, and his wife Mary Harlan Lincoln's sterling teaspoons.

24:09.436 --> 24:18.708
And then this is Mary Lincoln's morning fan, the morning collar, her morning veil, her sterling silver spoons.

24:19.389 --> 24:23.114
And then all these books were hers, and they're all signed and dated.

24:23.755 --> 24:24.176
By Mary.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.037
By Mary.

24:25.523 --> 24:33.771
And then these spoons are coin silver spoons that belong to her sister and husband and Wallaces.

24:34.572 --> 24:40.117
Then these books, let's see, what's the best?

24:40.137 --> 24:43.840
Okay, I have Robert Lincoln's copy of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates.

24:46.763 --> 24:55.311
This is a book that belonged and signed by Mary Lincoln Beckwith, who was the great-granddaughter

24:55.932 --> 25:04.922
This book was written by the nurse that took care of Willie when he died in the White House, and it's signed by her, Mrs. Pomeroy.

25:04.962 --> 25:15.814
And there's a letter, I have a copy of a letter in it from Springfield, where Robert wrote about getting the book and how he remembered her and liked her.

25:15.874 --> 25:23.543
This is Robert's copy and signed of a book, I guess, when they were in London and went to Westminster Abbey.

25:24.333 --> 25:29.399
This book is, they're all, see, they're all very personal.

25:29.459 --> 25:34.905
This is Abraham Lincoln II, his grandson's signature.

25:35.466 --> 25:36.787
It looks a lot like Lincoln's, doesn't it?

25:36.888 --> 25:39.170
He was very good at that, and that was his number.

25:39.210 --> 25:44.536
He had a whole numbering system of what he did with his library.

25:44.757 --> 25:52.045
And then this book is, I think this one is Tad's, Thomas Lincoln, signed.

25:52.632 --> 25:53.653
which is very unique.

25:53.673 --> 25:56.536
There are very few who tried to do A. Lincoln.

25:56.797 --> 25:57.958
No, no, this isn't the one.

25:57.978 --> 25:59.059
I have it over there.

25:59.079 --> 26:10.732
This one was given by Mary, and she puts, presented to Thomas Lincoln on the 15th anniversary of his birthday by his affectionate mother, Mary Lincoln, Chicago, April 4th, 1868.

26:12.835 --> 26:14.096
That's pretty spectacular.

26:14.677 --> 26:15.958
And let's see.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.182
These are Robert Lincoln's.

26:19.322 --> 26:22.065
Okay, here's Tad's school book, signed.

26:23.750 --> 26:32.483
This is when, after the assassination, they moved to Chicago.

26:38.111 --> 26:42.818
This was given to Robert Lincoln.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.522
It's a biography of Abraham Lincoln.

26:51.053 --> 26:55.419
Robert Lincoln Esquire with kind regards, and Arnold signed it.

26:57.242 --> 27:00.366
And then the same thing with this one.

27:02.770 --> 27:04.853
But this was when he went to Harvard.

27:05.634 --> 27:06.956
Robert signed it, R.T.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.079
Lincoln, Cambridge.

27:10.281 --> 27:12.364
Yes.

27:12.384 --> 27:20.115
And this is a signed

27:20.888 --> 27:26.834
I don't know what you'd call it, but Lincoln had it with him, and it was to a man named Mr. Kaysen.

27:27.415 --> 27:39.288
Kaysen was the man that outfitted and redid the inside of the car that took Lincoln from Springfield to Washington, and he gave this to Abraham Lincoln.

27:39.308 --> 27:40.929
That's K-A-S-S-A-N.

27:41.890 --> 27:44.093
W-M-Kaysen, April 1886.

27:49.478 --> 27:49.819
Okay.

27:49.979 --> 27:50.119
And?

27:51.095 --> 27:52.938
Another Mary Lincoln.

27:54.220 --> 27:55.281
What did she write in her?

27:55.301 --> 27:57.244
The Gate's ajar, so it must be a novel.

27:57.264 --> 27:58.366
Mary Lincoln.

27:58.406 --> 27:59.467
See, Robert saved it.

27:59.587 --> 28:02.932
Mary Lincoln, 1870, September.

28:04.715 --> 28:07.619
And what's in here, Andrew?

28:07.639 --> 28:08.320
Is it the Kitchell?

28:11.124 --> 28:12.566
Oh, this is fabulous.

28:12.586 --> 28:13.368
This is new.

28:13.388 --> 28:14.008
I just got it.

28:14.649 --> 28:14.770
Ah!

28:16.292 --> 28:16.632
This is great.

28:16.652 --> 28:18.375
I forgot about it.

28:18.395 --> 28:19.376
Oh, it's a manuscript.

28:19.396 --> 28:20.578
This is a manuscript.

28:20.828 --> 28:27.921
where Lincoln is defending a couple that accused a woman of being a whore.

28:29.443 --> 28:44.811
And in the first part, he says, you can see right here, Marianne Jacobus gets her fine clothing clothed up by whoring, say plaintiff.

28:45.398 --> 28:49.223
Mary Ann Jacobus is a whore.

28:49.463 --> 28:51.405
She gets her clothes by whoring.

28:52.126 --> 28:57.433
So it goes through the whole thing and they finally stay.

28:57.493 --> 28:59.996
She didn't own anything else.

29:00.016 --> 29:14.173
He was very clever because at the end he said that neither of the people had, let's see, knowledge, information or reasonable belief or want of charity on the part of the plaintiff or either of her sisters.

29:14.373 --> 29:20.321
And therefore, by the consent of the parties, this suit is dismissed, and each of the parties pay their own.

29:20.721 --> 29:34.339
But there was a part of it where he says she only owned the clothes she had on her back, so if she was whoring, she didn't do too well.

29:34.359 --> 29:38.585
Was that by a private acquisition or at a sale?

29:38.605 --> 29:39.105
A dealer.

29:39.366 --> 29:39.846
Oh, good.

29:39.866 --> 29:40.367
A dealer.

29:40.707 --> 29:42.950
Okay, this is Abraham Lincoln from his library.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.312
Oh, nice.

29:44.630 --> 29:53.622
And it was given to him by .

29:53.642 --> 29:54.623
And what is it?

29:54.964 --> 29:57.487
I love that cloth and the binding here.

29:57.987 --> 30:02.794
The Diplomatic Correspondents Department of State, so it's really its official .

30:03.695 --> 30:06.619
And then this is the history of the Lincoln family.

30:06.659 --> 30:11.145
This is the one signed by Robert Todd Lincoln Beck with the great-grandson.

30:11.165 --> 30:12.627
Does that say Worcester Mass on it?

30:12.847 --> 30:12.987
Mm-hmm.

30:13.007 --> 30:13.708
Worcester Mass?

30:14.650 --> 30:16.152
That's where we are.

30:20.459 --> 30:22.942
Worcester Mass.

30:23.804 --> 30:25.226
I wonder why Worcester is on there.

30:26.307 --> 30:29.052
Maybe the Antiquarian Society or something?

30:29.072 --> 30:29.813
Okay.

30:30.033 --> 30:32.356
History of the Lincoln Family.

30:32.517 --> 30:34.700
Presentation copy to Abraham Lincoln.

30:38.005 --> 30:41.750
Well, the Lincoln is from Worcester.

30:41.771 --> 30:41.971
Yeah.

30:41.991 --> 30:44.134
I wonder why that says Worcester Mass on it.

30:44.333 --> 30:48.458
The publisher gave Lincoln this, so it's just a presentation copy.

30:48.719 --> 30:49.399
I don't know why.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.885
There's always a Worcester connection, isn't it?

30:56.809 --> 31:07.843
And then... This is a presentation copy, a book signed by Stephen Douglas.

31:08.904 --> 31:13.310
And it's very rare, because I don't know anyone else that has one, and it's the Constitution.

31:13.330 --> 31:13.530
Oh, gee.

31:15.198 --> 31:16.820
And it belonged to Williamson.

31:16.840 --> 31:17.821
That's why it's such a thing.

31:18.021 --> 31:21.985
You know, the Lilly Library has Jefferson Davis' copy of the Constitution.

31:22.105 --> 31:22.906
Oh, you're kidding.

31:22.926 --> 31:23.707
Yeah, and it's signed.

31:23.747 --> 31:27.311
And then the guy who had it after that said, a heck of a lot of good it did him.

31:27.791 --> 31:29.413
He wrote right in it.

31:29.433 --> 31:31.215
But that's in the vault, the Lilly Library.

31:31.235 --> 31:34.398
So that gives you some idea of what you have here, you know.

31:34.418 --> 31:36.220
Wow.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.144
That's in the vault at the Lilly Library of Williamson.

31:39.164 --> 31:43.348
And then, let's see, these are...

31:43.733 --> 31:46.938
This is in the Lincoln inventory, what was in the house.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.784
And we've discovered that these were Mary Lincolns.

31:52.186 --> 31:57.996
And in the inventory, plus they're cookbooks.

31:58.016 --> 32:02.463
One's a house book and one's a cookbook to Mary Harlan.

32:04.426 --> 32:10.956
And then... This is Mary Lincoln.

32:13.231 --> 32:16.395
I've got a lot of Mary Lincoln books on.

32:16.415 --> 32:18.998
This is to Mrs. A. Lincoln with compliments.

32:19.018 --> 32:20.560
This is from the author.

32:21.020 --> 32:25.146
It's a presentation copy.

32:25.166 --> 32:30.572
And this is Mary Lincoln's letterbox.

32:30.612 --> 32:32.094
How long have you been acquiring all this?

32:33.295 --> 32:40.584
I've been collecting for about 18 years, but I'm really seriously doing all this for five years.

32:41.065 --> 32:41.145
Hmm.

32:41.868 --> 32:52.002
We're going to get into that, how she became a collector.

32:52.022 --> 32:57.250
This is Lincoln's private correspondence of James Madison.

32:57.370 --> 32:58.332
It was Lincoln's.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.417
You can see it's a special edition.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.382
It's a printed book.

33:05.542 --> 33:10.609
It's not a manuscript.

33:12.243 --> 33:17.528
to Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, from DeFries, and DeFries gave it to him.

33:17.888 --> 33:21.771
And you can see it's the, I forget what they call it, but it wasn't.

33:25.354 --> 33:37.185
And then these four books are from the Lincoln-Herndon Law Office, and one is a very rare Illinois book, and they're all signed Lincoln and Herndon, all by Herndon.

33:38.145 --> 33:41.068
And then this is Another Life of Abraham Lincoln,

33:42.061 --> 33:49.270
This is Robert Lincoln's copy of his father's life.

33:50.651 --> 33:51.833
This is Elmer Ellsworth.

33:54.997 --> 33:56.158
This is Mary Devlin.

33:56.178 --> 33:59.222
There's poems written by Edwin Booth to his first wife.

33:59.883 --> 34:03.087
This is Meserve, so it's all photographs of Lincoln.

34:03.427 --> 34:05.309
This is Mary's Surratt manuscript.

34:05.369 --> 34:07.672
She was the first lady.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.536
She was the, you know, the one that had the boarding house.

34:11.337 --> 34:11.697
Oh yeah.

34:11.727 --> 34:15.130
And this is actually a letter of hers.

34:15.150 --> 34:16.892
It's the only one in private hand.

34:18.474 --> 34:18.974
How do we spell?

34:18.994 --> 34:20.335
Mary Surratt.

34:20.355 --> 34:22.638
Her name is S-U-R-R-A-T-T.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.239
S-U-R-R-A-T-T.

34:24.960 --> 34:30.866
This is... God, we should probably pull it out.

34:30.886 --> 34:31.806
It's hard to explain.

34:32.547 --> 34:38.253
It's a salesman's copy of a book, The War of the Rebellion.

34:39.094 --> 34:41.616
And you had to sign up to order the book.

34:42.136 --> 34:44.759
Yeah.

34:44.779 --> 34:46.982
Do you know how to do the air?

34:47.964 --> 34:48.064
Yeah.

34:48.084 --> 34:49.526
So warm.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.128
Can you help me with that?

34:52.089 --> 34:56.034
Can I help you with that works?

34:56.054 --> 34:56.515
It's real handy.

34:56.555 --> 35:08.290
You can put this on that movie table.

35:08.310 --> 35:08.651
Over here.

35:08.671 --> 35:08.751
Yes.

35:13.051 --> 35:19.460
This is the book.

35:19.480 --> 35:19.820
And what?

35:20.481 --> 35:29.193
The salesman would go around and take this little book with him, and he'd say, This is what I'm selling.

35:30.214 --> 35:34.019
And this is one binding, and there's the other.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.382
These are very, very, very rare.

35:36.442 --> 35:37.243
I have both sets.

35:39.086 --> 35:40.628
They call salesman's dummies.

35:40.912 --> 35:49.922
And so, they put it together, just, it's a sample, and the chapters, and then people, you know, wrote in it.

35:51.744 --> 35:54.367
And then part of it's interesting, because part of it's in German.

35:55.569 --> 35:57.171
There it is.

35:57.191 --> 35:59.874
And then the people ordered it.

36:00.014 --> 36:09.805
And if you go through, I mean, it's every famous person in Washington, it's a library, Congress, and, you know, real important places, but,

36:10.460 --> 36:13.544
Look who else signed it.

36:13.564 --> 36:14.626
These are all their signatures, right?

36:15.307 --> 36:23.398
Gideon Wells, Chase, A. Lincoln.

36:25.260 --> 36:26.983
Lincoln ordered a library copy.

36:27.003 --> 36:28.605
Seward, Montgomery, Blair.

36:28.865 --> 36:30.207
That's your signature, right?

36:31.132 --> 36:32.874
So the salesman actually came in.

36:32.914 --> 36:35.977
He came in to the president and he ordered it.

36:35.997 --> 36:37.779
And it goes all the way through.

36:37.799 --> 36:38.700
So it's really fabulous.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.201
Isn't it wonderful?

36:39.221 --> 36:41.803
Let me just get the title of the book so I got it.

36:41.823 --> 36:42.664
The title.

36:42.684 --> 36:44.406
I love it.

36:44.706 --> 36:48.230
Is The Great Rebellion.

36:49.431 --> 36:50.112
I got it.

36:51.934 --> 36:52.875
The Great Rebellion.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.502
The History of the Civil Rights by T.J.

37:00.511 --> 37:15.610
And then... That's great.

37:18.394 --> 37:26.644
Salesman's dummies are... Can I do that for you?

37:26.724 --> 37:29.067
No, no, no.

37:29.367 --> 37:32.071
This is an original photograph of us.

37:32.091 --> 37:32.632
Here he is.

37:32.672 --> 37:34.014
Famous, famous picture.

37:34.034 --> 37:37.580
And then this is a little note.

37:37.620 --> 37:47.596
And the story is that during the war, Thomas Tad Lincoln would go in and bother the soldiers that were in the stables.

37:47.616 --> 37:49.879
And he asked to have his horse shoes.

37:50.420 --> 37:54.126
So they said, you know, go ask your father for permission.

37:54.477 --> 37:58.883
So he came back with this little note, and it says, Shoe Tad's horse for him, A. Lincoln.

37:58.923 --> 38:06.534
And so this soldier had it verified that it was to him, and he kept it in his pocket, they say, until the day he died.

38:06.734 --> 38:10.779
Shoe Tad's horse for him, A. Lincoln, April 7th, 18th.

38:10.819 --> 38:11.641
That's wonderful.

38:11.661 --> 38:20.513
And of course, that photo is the one they recently used as the basis for that stamp, the American reading, and it shows Lincoln.

38:20.553 --> 38:21.474
Very, very famous.

38:21.494 --> 38:22.155
You should get the stamp.

38:25.797 --> 38:32.126
And then this, this is very unique.

38:32.147 --> 38:34.009
See, Andrea, all the other parts aren't here.

38:34.029 --> 38:40.419
There was the book telling about it and everything.

38:43.163 --> 38:45.547
Yeah, but the original letter that goes in it.

38:45.647 --> 38:45.967
Okay.

38:46.688 --> 38:48.371
Maybe bring out the Lincoln box.

38:49.052 --> 38:53.138
This is, you've heard of Monaghan.

38:53.489 --> 38:58.155
Okay, Monaghan is for book collectors in Lincoln.

38:58.255 --> 39:00.959
Monaghan 1, 2, and it goes into the thousands.

39:00.979 --> 39:04.384
It's like the bibliography of Lincoln collecting.

39:05.265 --> 39:11.253
There's Monaghan, it's great to have Monaghan 1, 2, 3, and 4 are missing of the story, missing one of them.

39:11.273 --> 39:13.235
This is before one.

39:13.736 --> 39:15.398
They just discovered it.

39:16.460 --> 39:21.927
And it was used, Lincoln was defending a woman

39:22.497 --> 39:28.564
And this is the handbill that he had printed that was tacked up in the courtroom.

39:28.644 --> 39:30.285
Did you bring out the manuscript?

39:30.305 --> 39:30.926
They're in the drawer.

39:31.627 --> 39:32.808
In the glass.

39:37.433 --> 39:41.398
And this was part of the exhibit.

39:41.678 --> 39:48.285
This was Lincoln's copy, the only copy, because wherever it was hung, I guess it got thrown out or they didn't make very many of them.

39:48.670 --> 39:50.632
And it was used in the courtroom.

39:50.652 --> 39:54.435
And if I pull it out, you'll see there's notes on the back with his writing.

39:55.035 --> 40:06.085
But then also part of it, there's a manuscript where he took this part because he needed to show it to the court and hand wrote it because they didn't have their own machines.

40:06.585 --> 40:07.686
And we have that piece.

40:18.255 --> 40:18.475
Is that it?

40:18.978 --> 40:20.841
And he writes a copy.

40:20.861 --> 40:23.224
And you can see where it says judgment.

40:23.305 --> 40:26.529
He copies it exactly as it is there in his hand.

40:27.150 --> 40:29.234
So it really goes together.

40:29.274 --> 40:30.075
That's great.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.602
Very, very, very rare.

40:34.982 --> 40:36.525
These are handbills to the public.

40:37.286 --> 40:40.430
August 5th, 1837.

40:40.631 --> 40:40.971
Wow.

40:41.672 --> 40:44.036
Abraham Lincoln's statement by Benjamin Talbot.

40:44.837 --> 40:45.458
Charles R.

40:45.978 --> 40:47.239
M-E-T-A-G-N-Y.

40:47.259 --> 40:47.460
Matheny.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.161
Matheny.

40:48.181 --> 40:49.983
Stephen T. Logan.

40:50.003 --> 40:50.523
Simeon.

40:50.543 --> 40:51.144
Simeon.

40:51.164 --> 40:51.404
S-I-M-E-O-N.

40:51.424 --> 40:51.865
Francis.

40:52.766 --> 40:54.728
Seventh, eight, eight, eight, eight.

40:54.748 --> 41:02.177
See, Simeon Francis printed it in the newspaper because he was the publisher of the Sangamo Journal, which was the paper.

41:03.418 --> 41:06.502
And I think what?

41:06.562 --> 41:12.348
Rare Werewolf.

41:12.368 --> 41:13.690
Do you want to go to the next one?

41:18.175 --> 41:19.016
Furniture pieces?

41:20.818 --> 41:21.640
Lincoln?

41:22.240 --> 41:22.681
No.

41:22.701 --> 41:25.104
You want me to pull those up?

41:25.144 --> 41:35.958
I'll just show a few of these, then we can get to those albums later and just do some manual scripts, I think.

41:36.820 --> 41:38.682
There's just a few I wanted you to see.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.047
I'll offer to help you with it.

41:46.067 --> 41:48.250
I'm afraid to handle these things.

41:56.039 --> 42:01.246
Okay, this piece is a wanted poster.

42:01.546 --> 42:03.188
Oh, is this the group wanted poster?

42:03.969 --> 42:06.272
This is... And I'll show you.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.774
I have an earlier one.

42:07.794 --> 42:08.555
I know how.

42:10.457 --> 42:11.098
Musicians don't know.

42:11.669 --> 42:15.335
These are very, very, very scarce, these posters.

42:15.355 --> 42:17.237
Because a lot of them were fakes.

42:17.278 --> 42:18.600
That's right.

42:18.620 --> 42:19.321
This is a good one.

42:19.821 --> 42:22.125
Howard Gottlieb has one across the university.

42:22.145 --> 42:25.129
He told me how this is going, his prized possessions.

42:27.373 --> 42:34.884
Did that have a date on it, Andrea?

42:34.904 --> 42:36.006
Did they date this poster?

42:38.264 --> 42:44.070
Yeah, so this was issued like almost right away.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.613
But I have an earlier one that was the first one.

42:46.993 --> 42:48.755
I'll show you that one.

42:49.296 --> 42:54.722
So that's what makes it so scary.

42:54.862 --> 42:56.183
This is the playbill.

42:56.544 --> 42:58.065
Oh, the playbill.

42:58.145 --> 43:02.350
And a ticket seat number.

43:02.370 --> 43:06.094
And I have another ticket that's a

43:07.120 --> 43:08.542
What do you call it?

43:08.602 --> 43:12.769
I guess a receipt that you pick up your ticket for the dress circle.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.234
Was that the night of April 14th?

43:16.835 --> 43:18.337
Friday evening, April 14th?

43:18.357 --> 43:20.641
Mm-hmm.

43:20.701 --> 43:21.162
Okay.

43:21.302 --> 43:24.287
That gives you goosebumps.

43:31.418 --> 43:32.660
Oh, that's just a commission.

43:33.761 --> 43:34.883
Signed by Lincoln.

43:35.858 --> 43:37.580
This is unique.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.845
This is an entire real estate transaction handled by Lincoln.

43:43.647 --> 43:51.817
And the Todd family, Mary Lincoln's family, invested in land in Springfield, Illinois.

43:51.857 --> 43:59.787
And Mariah Todd Bullock, Mary Lincoln's aunt, decided she wanted to sell some of the land.

43:59.847 --> 44:02.170
So she asked Abraham Lincoln to represent her.

44:02.707 --> 44:04.169
And it took him five years.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.370
He made no money.

44:05.390 --> 44:06.572
It cost him money.

44:06.632 --> 44:10.637
And these are all the parts to it.

44:11.097 --> 44:13.400
This is the plat map that he had made.

44:13.420 --> 44:15.863
And all this is his writing.

44:16.564 --> 44:17.585
This is his writing.

44:18.126 --> 44:20.469
And he divided up and showed where it was.

44:20.949 --> 44:23.833
Then he had to have a public sale and sell some.

44:25.194 --> 44:25.895
He did that.

44:26.356 --> 44:28.258
And a man that bought it

44:30.584 --> 44:32.587
Let's see, what is this one?

44:32.707 --> 44:39.837
This is the terms to who it was sold to.

44:40.177 --> 44:40.998
This is the Vinnie.

44:41.118 --> 44:43.001
This man, William Vinnie, bought it.

44:43.081 --> 44:45.304
So this is the deed and the whole thing.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.027
All that's Lincoln's writing.

44:48.108 --> 44:56.920
Then Vinnie, they went and took the note to the assessor's office.

44:57.681 --> 44:58.803
It's in his writing.

44:59.824 --> 45:00.405
Then...

45:02.225 --> 45:03.826
A busy lawyer, wasn't he?

45:03.846 --> 45:05.888
He did all the... That's another part of it.

45:09.872 --> 45:18.319
Then he promises to pay Mariah Bullock, and this is his note, but Lincoln wrote the whole thing out.

45:18.940 --> 45:32.232
Two years after date, I promised to pay Mrs. Mariah Bullock $81 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from date until pay.

45:32.566 --> 45:33.687
And then Vinnie signed it.

45:34.168 --> 45:35.629
Well, then Vinnie couldn't pay it.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.914
It's a whole history, isn't it?

45:39.934 --> 45:41.776
That's more recent.

45:47.062 --> 45:48.504
That's all in Lincoln's writing.

45:49.145 --> 45:50.506
This is part of the transaction.

45:50.526 --> 45:51.067
And when is this?

45:51.087 --> 45:53.129
This is probably in the 40s or 30s?

45:53.290 --> 45:56.693
It's Stark, and we'll have it written on the cover, don't we?

45:56.733 --> 45:57.274
What year?

46:02.722 --> 46:10.170
These are the legals.

46:11.231 --> 46:12.913
You had to take Vinnie to court.

46:12.993 --> 46:20.681
I've had them cleaned, so they were folded and Lincoln didn't rip the pages, so when we encapsulated them, we left them full.

46:21.021 --> 46:23.584
That's all the whole legal process.

46:23.604 --> 46:27.047
Yeah, usually they're folded just to be like something like that.

46:27.167 --> 46:29.370
Well, it's two pages, but we didn't want to tear them.

46:29.390 --> 46:31.632
If Lincoln didn't tear them, we're not going to.

46:32.084 --> 46:34.186
And that's one.

46:36.908 --> 46:39.791
And there's the other.

46:41.172 --> 46:45.356
And that was the whole transaction.

46:45.696 --> 46:50.300
I never made any money on that.

46:52.282 --> 46:52.402
No.

46:52.902 --> 46:54.804
Honest Abe.

46:54.824 --> 46:56.846
Want to sit down?

46:56.866 --> 46:57.286
Yeah.

47:01.369 --> 47:01.990
Sure.

47:02.527 --> 47:30.255
I'll just pull out things that

47:32.834 --> 47:33.495
are unique.

47:35.798 --> 47:36.439
I love that.

47:36.719 --> 47:38.782
Just things that are unique.

47:38.802 --> 47:39.923
No, none for me, thanks.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.508
This is 1832.

47:44.770 --> 47:48.555
This is when he was captain in the Black Hawk War.

47:52.179 --> 47:52.560
May I?

47:52.900 --> 47:53.081
Sure.

47:55.644 --> 47:59.449
I do hereby certify that William Carpenter was

48:00.323 --> 48:09.213
This is fabulous.

48:10.334 --> 48:30.077
You've heard of the Lincoln Berry Store in New Salem.

48:31.002 --> 48:34.447
He went into business and opened his store, but he had to take a loan.

48:34.507 --> 48:39.174
This is the only loan he ever took, and this is the document.

48:39.194 --> 48:40.016
That's the only loan.

48:40.376 --> 48:41.418
This is the only loan?

48:41.438 --> 48:41.918
1833.

48:42.880 --> 48:43.901
What do we call this again?

48:44.022 --> 48:47.587
This is the, it's a, how do I describe it?

48:49.950 --> 48:50.812
It's a receipt.

48:52.354 --> 48:53.075
Well, it's a loan.

48:53.416 --> 48:59.625
It says, all in Lincoln's hand, one day after date, we or either of us promised to pay

49:00.027 --> 49:01.248
Reuben Radford.

49:01.288 --> 49:04.031
It's a promissory note, yeah.

49:04.372 --> 49:10.539
$379.82 for value received is witness our hand and seal.

49:11.039 --> 49:18.147
And Lincoln signed it, Barry signed it, and... Barry, how do you spell his name?

49:24.113 --> 49:27.317
And then there's some penciling in when they started paying it off.

49:28.242 --> 49:34.047
That's quite a document, because it's part of the folklore of the man, too.

49:34.107 --> 49:55.667
Well, here's another one from New Salem, and this is one where Lincoln was postmaster, and he writes, Missers, your subscriber at this place, John C. Vance, is dead, and no person takes the paper from this office, respectfully, a Lincoln PM.

49:56.153 --> 49:58.096
Postmaster.

49:59.017 --> 50:05.666
I try to collect every phase of his life, and I like the real personal things.

50:08.190 --> 50:16.321
This is something, just a note from his first law partner that's all in his writing, but it was Lincoln and Stewart.

50:16.902 --> 50:18.765
And I have Lincoln, you know, with all of them.

50:22.570 --> 50:25.975
This is a bond that was signed by Lincoln.

50:27.136 --> 50:34.003
And after 1860, after 1840, he very rarely signed a bond.

50:38.108 --> 50:40.090
This was the trial we saw.

50:47.618 --> 50:48.619
Oh, this is great.

50:48.899 --> 50:54.645
This is the only document I have ever seen signed by Lincoln and Douglas together.

50:55.587 --> 50:57.429
and it was during the trial.

50:58.069 --> 51:01.813
Lincoln was for the plaintiff and Douglas for the defendant.

51:02.754 --> 51:04.896
And the date is August 17th, 1839.

51:04.956 --> 51:07.298
That's kind of neat.

51:07.318 --> 51:08.179
Can I just hold that?

51:08.219 --> 51:08.680
Sure.

51:10.681 --> 51:20.110
Stephen T. Logan versus James Adams from the Circle Court of Swithersburg?

51:20.131 --> 51:22.793
I don't know how to do this, but it's a point.

51:22.813 --> 51:23.774
It's a point.

51:23.794 --> 51:24.835
He is agreed by the

51:26.671 --> 51:31.897
parties to the above case that the same be continued.

51:31.937 --> 51:41.329
There's a place that's legalese, signed August 17, 1831, Abraham A. Lincoln for plaintiff, Douglas for defendant.

51:41.349 --> 51:42.770
Isn't that something?

51:42.950 --> 51:47.175
Isn't that great?

51:47.236 --> 51:48.858
Yeah, that's exciting.

51:50.700 --> 51:52.302
I'm just going to pull out.

51:52.322 --> 51:54.444
Do you think there's anything like that at the National Archives?

51:54.464 --> 51:55.986
There's none ever anywhere.

51:57.788 --> 52:07.884
Again, was that something that you acquired privately or at a sale, do you remember?

52:08.364 --> 52:09.767
That was privately.

52:10.928 --> 52:14.133
So you're like, you really are on alert, aren't you?

52:14.374 --> 52:15.556
Oh, yeah.

52:16.056 --> 52:25.190
Like a wolf on the hunt.

52:25.211 --> 52:26.192
Coffee's wonderful, by the way.

52:28.214 --> 52:29.836
No, thank you.

52:29.856 --> 52:30.397
Right now?

52:30.417 --> 52:35.143
Maybe a little bit later.

52:35.163 --> 52:36.945
Where's the piece at the Huntington?

52:37.025 --> 52:38.387
Oh, we have a bunch of things at the Huntington Hill.

52:40.289 --> 52:45.256
Now, you're going to be participating in an exhibit next year, I think you told me.

52:45.416 --> 52:45.576
Right.

52:45.596 --> 52:49.101
Jointly with the Huntington and the State of Illinois.

52:49.882 --> 52:58.052
That's quite an honor to have two institutions like the Huntington and the Historical Society of Illinois, and a private individual.

52:59.163 --> 53:00.625
It's never been done.

53:01.386 --> 53:06.152
I guess that gives some indication of the strength of your collection, I guess.

53:07.193 --> 53:21.190
I want to talk at some point about how Louise Tapin became a Lincoln collector and the energy that drives it and what you're hoping to accomplish.

53:21.531 --> 53:24.755
As much as I'm enjoying this, but I know your time is precious.

53:25.476 --> 53:26.537
People come here.

53:26.922 --> 53:30.006
from Library of Congress, and they want to look.

53:30.046 --> 53:31.508
And you can't see it in a day.

53:31.528 --> 53:32.248
It takes days.

53:32.329 --> 53:33.710
I've got Mary Lincoln.

53:33.730 --> 53:37.995
It started, I read a book when my kids were babies.

53:38.176 --> 53:41.199
I read a book, Love is Eternal by Irving Stone.

53:41.960 --> 53:44.563
Don't give them any credit because I didn't like it.

53:44.583 --> 53:51.732
But I read the book, and I just wanted to know what happened to the children's children.

53:52.387 --> 53:55.471
You know, you read the whole story and he's assassinated and it ends.

53:55.571 --> 53:57.594
And then I thought, gee, what happened to the children?

53:58.055 --> 53:58.996
What happened to the wife?

53:59.056 --> 53:59.857
I was curious.

54:00.478 --> 54:05.284
And my brother collects rare newspapers from Revolutionary War on.

54:05.324 --> 54:08.629
So I called him up and said, how can I find out?

54:08.789 --> 54:11.813
And he said, he gave me two numbers to call.

54:12.554 --> 54:17.240
A man in charge of rare books before Alan Judsy, it was Cary Bliss.

54:17.400 --> 54:21.786
And he said, call Cary Bliss at the Huntington or call Dawson's Bookshop.

54:22.627 --> 54:32.844
Well, to make long story short, they both led me to a man named Justin Turner, who had been the leading Lincoln collector in the country at that time.

54:33.966 --> 54:48.010
And I met him, was introduced to him, and immediately he was excited because he was an old man, and he was thrilled that someone real young was interested in Lincoln.

54:48.175 --> 54:50.358
So he said, I will work with you.

54:50.418 --> 54:51.821
You can come over every day.

54:51.901 --> 54:53.203
You can go through my files.

54:53.223 --> 54:54.284
You can do anything you want.

54:54.465 --> 54:56.888
I'd love for you to learn Lincoln and carry it on.

54:58.471 --> 54:59.693
So a collector got you.

54:59.773 --> 55:02.076
Another collector got you.

55:02.116 --> 55:02.377
Right.

55:02.537 --> 55:07.024
But his daughter was married to a man that owned a manuscript gallery.

55:07.204 --> 55:12.372
So we became friends, and I wanted to learn about collecting that way also.

55:12.732 --> 55:15.837
So I said, could I work for you, but I don't want the money?

55:16.357 --> 55:18.439
just figure out what you pay me per hour.

55:18.459 --> 55:21.962
At the end of the year, we'll add it up, and I'll pick out documents.

55:22.583 --> 55:23.684
So we did that.

55:24.584 --> 55:26.006
And I worked off and on.

55:26.026 --> 55:27.567
I could choose my own hours.

55:27.687 --> 55:33.913
And then from there, everyone started coming to me because I was just obsessed.

55:33.973 --> 55:37.376
I started buying books and forming a reference library.

55:37.937 --> 55:40.679
And I had the contacts because of Justin Turner.

55:41.100 --> 55:44.963
So I ended up doing the six one-hour specials on Abraham Lincoln

55:45.280 --> 55:48.184
Sandberg's Lincoln, where Hal Holbrook played Lincoln.

55:48.684 --> 55:50.567
Now, you say you did them?

55:50.587 --> 56:02.361
Well, I was signed on at the beginning, before the scripts were written, and my job was to divide Lincoln's life into six parts.

56:03.182 --> 56:10.191
Then, they picked six writers, and they had to be Academy Award-winning or Emmy Award-winning writers.

56:10.492 --> 56:15.419
And then I would supply them with all the information, and they'd put it in the script form.

56:15.459 --> 56:18.584
So they wanted unique things or something exciting.

56:19.365 --> 56:23.271
And it was fun, because then when we went into production, they said, could you stay on?

56:23.832 --> 56:29.820
I worked with the costume people, showed them pictures, the makeup people, set decorators, everything.

56:29.840 --> 56:30.481
So it was fun.

56:30.521 --> 56:32.044
And this was all done here, of course.

56:32.264 --> 56:32.544
Yes.

56:34.026 --> 56:36.130
And I got to go to Springfield to do research.

56:37.211 --> 56:37.832
Then...

56:38.167 --> 56:43.132
But I still want to go, again, you read the book and you want to know what happened to the children.

56:43.252 --> 56:45.554
I'm still wondering what?

56:45.574 --> 56:49.758
Did you know inside that you were a collector, that you had this... No.

56:49.978 --> 56:54.082
Well, it started, you know, I couldn't afford to buy things.

56:54.222 --> 56:55.783
I really couldn't afford to do it.

56:55.884 --> 57:06.013
So I, every so often, instead of, you know, it was a birthday or something, I would say, oh, I want to give me money so I could go buy whatever I wanted.

57:06.297 --> 57:13.063
And, you know, most women wanted clothing or jewelry, and I just really cared about getting Lincoln things.

57:13.784 --> 57:20.109
So I did that, and then a number of years, it was like dormant, but it was always there.

57:20.149 --> 57:31.859
And I was always involved in the Manuscript Society and was the first woman president of the Los Angeles or Southern California Manuscript Society, and just kept active.

57:32.580 --> 57:35.983
And then I married my husband about

57:36.942 --> 57:38.183
We're married six years.

57:38.203 --> 57:47.574
And I decided I sold some property and I decided I was going to invest in some manuscripts in a big way.

57:48.295 --> 57:54.581
So we went to the Doheny sale and I bought the California Emancipation Proclamation.

57:55.603 --> 57:58.906
And I paid double what I intended to pay.

57:59.287 --> 58:01.930
And he said, you are crazy.

58:02.650 --> 58:03.651
What is wrong with you?

58:04.552 --> 58:06.915
And I said, well, I had to have it.

58:07.250 --> 58:34.067
reporters came up and you know they wanted names i told them i don't want any publicity anything at the time and then i started just buying some things and pretty soon it was well you know i don't want to use up all my money and my husband said well you know i'll give you some now and before you know it he's a collector with me and now we're both just totally obsessed and i guess the training that i had

58:34.604 --> 58:41.494
all those years when I really couldn't afford to buy, made it lucky because then when I could, I knew what to do.

58:41.534 --> 58:51.209
And I knew exactly what to do because I, Tom Schwartz, you spoke with Tom, who's the curator in Springfield.

58:51.630 --> 58:55.656
I said to him, oh, come on, anyone with money can go and make a collection.

58:55.696 --> 58:56.577
He said, it's not true.

58:57.639 --> 59:01.945
If you gave someone millions of dollars and said, go out and be a collector,

59:02.144 --> 59:11.156
If you don't have a collector's mentality and you're not focused, you cannot acquire a collection like this.

59:11.236 --> 59:14.060
If you have millions of dollars, anybody can be an accumulator.

59:14.300 --> 59:14.821
Exactly.

59:15.561 --> 59:22.571
But to be a collector, you have to have the knowledge and the focus and the direction and taste.

59:23.071 --> 59:32.083
I have met accumulators who have major collections and they have people that come to their home and put it together and put it on the shelf and do all that.

59:33.025 --> 59:35.228
I do all, we do everything ourselves.

59:35.688 --> 59:51.106
I fly wherever I have to go, pick up the piece, bring it back, or I have it bought for me and it's sent here, we catalog it, we get it deacidified, encapsulated, and we do all the research on it, and, you know, really.

59:51.126 --> 59:56.712
I mean, you wouldn't think of hiring an agent and saying, gee, put together a Lincoln collection.

59:56.732 --> 59:58.514
Never, never, never.

59:59.135 --> 01:00:02.779
And because I'm so focused into Lincoln,

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:08.883
and Mary Lincoln and the children that everyone knows me.

01:00:08.903 --> 01:00:11.706
And wherever I go, I hear someone, oh, you're from Illinois?

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:15.811
Gee, do you know anyone in your family knows anything about anyone that has any Lincoln pieces?

01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:18.914
And I have gotten a lot of things that way.

01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:23.619
And I have an apartment in Springfield, Illinois, and go there a lot.

01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:30.707
So naturally now I'm on the board of the Abraham Lincoln Association and the Lincoln Legals and all the different groups.
