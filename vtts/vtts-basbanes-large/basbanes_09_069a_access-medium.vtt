WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:18.393
I'm often invited to give lectures, but they're usually just one event, so I focus on that.

00:18.793 --> 00:28.823
But it can take quite a while because, of course, one wants to focus one's thoughts in a very condensed way, and then there's a sense, too, that one wants it to be

00:29.039 --> 00:32.342
as good as possible, so there's a lot of revision involved.

00:33.944 --> 00:53.883
If it's okay, I'll start talking a little bit about the book, and if we don't really get into the book itself, please understand that I'm writing a feature, and I really believe that books speak eloquently on their own merits, and it's presumptuous of me to ask you specific things about the novel.

00:54.023 --> 00:58.928
Inevitably, of course, we probably will talk about the novel, but I am interested in writing

00:59.212 --> 01:01.295
I'll just shut this up.

01:01.315 --> 01:20.418
Let me say, I know you've done this many times in the past, but it does... I am really awestruck by the way in which you can assume the voice of a man and really pull it off so convincingly.

01:21.520 --> 01:28.088
Apparently, I'm not intimidated at all about really writing and creating from these footprints.

01:28.304 --> 01:32.110
from the perspective of a male character?

01:32.130 --> 01:35.555
No, I think I understand certain kinds of men very well.

01:36.035 --> 01:41.023
Also, I feel deep sympathy and identification with many men.

01:41.844 --> 01:45.149
I think issues of gender are probably not that relevant.

01:46.030 --> 01:56.826
I can understand certain individual men better than I can understand certain individual women, and the same is true for men.

01:57.700 --> 02:05.171
theory of gender is quite as impermeable as some people think.

02:05.191 --> 02:22.215
What interested me about this particular novel was the phenomenon, as I see it, of how a person creates his own personality, or how we invent selves as we grow older.

02:22.235 --> 02:24.518
We have a child's

02:26.455 --> 02:28.297
that may be the natural self.

02:30.340 --> 02:38.891
And then around adolescence, we start to create another self with which we confront our peers.

02:39.472 --> 02:54.452
And Corky Corcoran in the novel is one of these characters who might have become very introverted, very angry at the world, very depressed and morbid, but he takes a different turn.

02:54.492 --> 02:56.074
He becomes extroverted

02:57.117 --> 02:59.840
He gets involved in sports in high school.

02:59.900 --> 03:06.028
He's seeking after the popular boys and becomes friends with them.

03:06.709 --> 03:12.896
And he's kind of a sunny, funny, cheerful kid on the outside.

03:13.857 --> 03:25.251
And whatever is on the inside, he keeps hidden until when we see him at the age of 42, and he is almost completely this other person.

03:25.653 --> 03:27.896
a handshaker and a backslapper.

03:27.956 --> 03:31.701
He's very well loved by some people.

03:31.741 --> 03:35.346
He's involved in city politics in the city, something like Buffalo.

03:36.107 --> 03:37.709
He's a democratic councilman.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.592
Something like Buffalo.

03:40.753 --> 03:44.758
Something like Buffalo, yeah.

03:45.078 --> 03:46.861
He's the kind of person whom we meet.

03:47.601 --> 03:54.951
We see a person like this come into a room and other people look around and their faces light up because he's got a lot of jokes and he brings energy to it.

03:55.673 --> 04:01.682
an event, he shakes people's hands, you know, and women like him because he likes women and men like him.

04:02.583 --> 04:23.773
And I wanted to explore what might be inside a person like that, who in some ways is antithetical to myself, because I am rather introverted and rather quiet and analytical, but the extroverted personality seems to be quintessentially American, very related to other people.

04:24.496 --> 04:26.199
and wanting to be popular.

04:27.641 --> 04:30.606
That seems to me a very American value.

04:30.626 --> 04:30.987
I think so.

04:31.187 --> 04:36.576
And you mentioned also the city, Union City, a lot like Buffalo.

04:36.596 --> 04:40.783
I remember doing an interview with Ruth Rendell, a year or so ago.

04:40.803 --> 04:41.324
Oh, really?

04:41.344 --> 04:46.072
Yeah, she came through, and we were talking about British fiction, English fiction in America.

04:46.513 --> 04:50.740
And she said that one thing that made us heard about American novels is how

04:51.327 --> 04:53.069
how critically important Place is.

04:53.149 --> 04:54.710
Oh, yeah.

04:54.870 --> 04:58.074
And she said this about her book.

04:58.094 --> 05:03.199
She said, you could take this book right here, whichever one it was, and you could just put it anywhere.

05:03.739 --> 05:06.662
Place really wasn't so essential, she thought.

05:07.443 --> 05:09.425
That's the kind of writing that she does.

05:09.445 --> 05:14.329
But Iris Murdoch, for instance, is so saturated in Place.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.494
Iris Murdoch has a novel that's all about the underground among them.

05:19.294 --> 05:20.035
Exactly.

05:20.268 --> 05:25.374
There are other English writers, certainly of the early 20th century, like D.H.

05:25.394 --> 05:30.200
Lawrence and Thomas Hardy, who are very saturated in plays.

05:30.220 --> 05:30.801
Hardy especially.

05:30.861 --> 05:34.425
So you wouldn't necessarily accept that?

05:34.585 --> 05:40.653
Well, Ruth Render does a certain kind of novel that's more like a concept novel, problem novel.

05:40.673 --> 05:44.477
She's just a wonderful suspense mystery novel.

05:44.497 --> 05:47.020
And the mystery is a concept.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.363
It's as if we had a puzzle on the table.

05:49.799 --> 05:57.348
and you were laying out the jigsaw puzzle pieces, and you could take the whole thing, I suppose, and put it over in some other area.

05:58.229 --> 06:18.692
But those of us who are very much related to a region or a country, I identify with America very much, are really writing out of a sense of something more organic and integral, where the people whom we write about are of their place and their time.

06:20.478 --> 06:23.221
This book is impossible without Irish Hill, I mean.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.104
Yes, right, Irish-American.

06:25.264 --> 06:25.784
Right, really.

06:25.925 --> 06:34.735
Yes, a sense of being victimized, which sometimes is true, and sometimes it's just what they're saying, you know, a bit of blarning.

06:35.516 --> 06:45.368
And you have to know that when an Irish person says something, it may or may not be uttered in absolute truth.

06:45.809 --> 06:48.612
Much of what is said is playful.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.392
It's like music or poetry.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.795
It isn't meant to be taken absolutely literally.

06:55.496 --> 07:06.070
When Corky, for instance, says these awful things about women or thinks these awful things about women, those are not 100% himself.

07:06.151 --> 07:09.575
That's a fleeting moment in his life.

07:11.017 --> 07:14.802
And some people have isolated things that Corky said.

07:15.980 --> 07:20.925
or thought out of the 600 pages of the novel as if this stood for him.

07:21.686 --> 07:44.468
But certainly the whole Irish sensibility is very playful, and I don't mean insincere, but there is a sense of that language inhabits its own sphere.

07:45.224 --> 07:54.292
the idea of the scheme here, where you decided to really write about a character who you said was just maybe 180 degrees different from yourself.

07:54.332 --> 07:54.572
Yes.

07:54.853 --> 07:59.957
Did you have the story in mind, or was it, do you start with a concept of this character?

08:01.879 --> 08:10.807
I'm wondering how you really pointed to this weekend, for instance, here, in which everything seems to reveal itself.

08:11.107 --> 08:14.370
Well, to be absolutely honest, the origins of

08:14.907 --> 08:18.391
of long works I think are shrouded in mystery.

08:19.091 --> 08:44.138
And I remember waking up one morning some years ago feeling such a sense of excitement and elation that I was going to write a novel about a man who would be very different from myself and he would be representative of a certain kind of masculinity, very macho, but also very well-liked, a kind of popular man.

08:44.405 --> 08:49.891
a man who has lots of friends, a type I've never written about before.

08:49.951 --> 08:52.834
And I was very excited, I can remember that.

08:53.555 --> 08:56.619
Strange sense of elation that lasted for hours.

08:57.660 --> 09:03.246
But at that point I didn't have the story, and I didn't really have Corky.

09:04.347 --> 09:07.971
Then a little later I thought, well I'll write about an Irish-American male.

09:07.991 --> 09:13.197
I've never written about that particular type before.

09:13.565 --> 09:18.571
I'm descended from Irish-Americans, partly on the other side of my family.

09:18.611 --> 09:20.814
My mother's side is Hungarian.

09:21.555 --> 09:27.222
And I've written a lot about middle European people, that is, you know, the descendants.

09:28.123 --> 09:34.591
But I've never really done very much with the Irish-American strings, and to me that was very exciting.

09:35.312 --> 09:40.939
So it's corkiest based on some men I know.

09:41.223 --> 09:44.327
Very fleetingly, an uncle of mine.

09:46.570 --> 09:51.536
Did you hear the voice before you had the, you said, before you knew who he was?

09:51.556 --> 09:57.644
Well, I always, as soon as I thought I'd write about an Irish-American, I always knew who Corky was, and I always knew him.

09:57.704 --> 10:07.156
The trouble, the difficulty for me as a novelist is to find the narrative voice, so I have to experiment with my narrative voice.

10:07.216 --> 10:08.698
I always knew what Corky sounded like.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.587
I could write pages and pages of him talking.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.553
I always do that when I'm starting a novel.

10:15.593 --> 10:23.045
I just have my characters talk, and they talk and explain themselves, and they get in scenes with other characters.

10:23.265 --> 10:32.099
The stories that I write arise from the characters, just as the stories in our lives tend to arise from our characters.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.564
And I don't really write about random things.

10:35.865 --> 10:37.487
I mean, in real life, you and I,

10:37.737 --> 10:39.880
can have random experiences.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.425
We could leave this hotel and be struck by a car.

10:43.465 --> 10:46.149
It has no integral relationship to our lives.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.853
But in a novel, everything arises from character.

10:50.556 --> 10:54.141
So as soon as you have a character, you know what's going to happen.

10:55.383 --> 11:05.618
When Corky learns that a young woman seems to have committed suicide, he is not the kind of person who will be incurious about it.

11:05.902 --> 11:07.423
He's going to find out more about it.

11:07.444 --> 11:08.685
He's very inquisitive.

11:09.466 --> 11:12.308
And as he says a couple of times, he should have been a cop.

11:12.869 --> 11:18.574
He should have been an Irish cop because he has this restless sense of wanting to know more.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.956
He's always asking questions.

11:20.757 --> 11:28.104
Now, another man would have let it go, would have been sorry for the fact that this young woman died, but wouldn't have done anything about it.

11:28.484 --> 11:34.390
Whereas for four days, Corky's driving around town, trying to ferret out information, makes telephone calls.

11:34.808 --> 11:43.417
He's getting deeper and deeper into trouble because the people who are responsible for this young woman's killing herself are always aware of what he's doing.

11:44.358 --> 11:50.145
They know what he's doing, and he should know better, but he can't help them.

11:50.165 --> 11:57.072
And he gets deeper and deeper into what he sees to be some sort of a scheme or a plot or a conspiracy.

11:57.913 --> 12:01.457
The reader always knows a little more what of course he's doing than he knows.

12:01.893 --> 12:04.898
You really needed that contracted period, too, didn't you?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.179
Yeah, everything coming together.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.404
To give it that tension, even.

12:09.665 --> 12:09.945
Yeah.

12:09.965 --> 12:12.689
It couldn't really be spread out over a period of time.

12:12.729 --> 12:15.574
You really did have to focus it, I think.

12:15.934 --> 12:19.279
Again, this came through the process of writing the novel.

12:19.359 --> 12:23.406
I mean, you didn't really have this online, so to speak.

12:23.426 --> 12:24.607
Oh, yes, I always had the online.

12:24.627 --> 12:24.808
Do you?

12:24.888 --> 12:28.774
Oh, I knew it would just be four days around Memorial Day.

12:28.934 --> 12:29.655
It had to end.

12:31.357 --> 12:35.281
It ends on Memorial Day for symbolic reasons.

12:36.302 --> 12:44.191
But you learn later on in the novel, the center of Corky's emotional life, which is related to his mother.

12:44.752 --> 12:56.245
And it's the short chapter called The Kiss, where we see what Corky's mother was like when he was 11 years old, or I think he's 12 years old.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.288
And why he's so fascinated by women

12:59.572 --> 13:09.044
And he's so susceptible to women, but he can't be faithful to any one woman because he's pursuing this elusive chimera.

13:09.284 --> 13:16.332
His own mother was so mysterious, a very beautiful and schizophrenic woman who died young.

13:16.933 --> 13:20.678
So he's always pursuing this elusive image of a woman.

13:21.439 --> 13:22.940
And I think that's how people are.

13:22.981 --> 13:27.486
Did you also...

13:28.850 --> 13:31.033
That opening scene, of course, is gripping.

13:31.053 --> 13:41.769
I mean, if you want to grab a reader, you do it quite, quite powerfully with that scene of the wreath out in front of the house.

13:43.852 --> 13:45.314
Again, you started with Corky now.

13:45.514 --> 13:48.839
Now you had to build his life around him, didn't you?

13:49.239 --> 13:50.741
Right, around there.

13:50.761 --> 13:56.730
And then you had to have this very important scene, you know, but you had to have that right away to get to kind of

13:56.963 --> 13:59.788
to see why everything follows from there.

14:00.308 --> 14:03.313
What kind of a boy would he have been if his father had lived?

14:03.934 --> 14:07.200
Not the boy, and then not the man he does become.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.667
And that line, you're the only witness, you know.

14:11.707 --> 14:13.670
The only witness, but he can't lie.

14:13.731 --> 14:15.754
He didn't really see the car.

14:15.894 --> 14:18.058
But the police wanted him to.

14:18.518 --> 14:23.747
But I've been in situations like that where I almost have seen something

14:24.773 --> 14:26.936
And, oh, I almost remember something.

14:26.956 --> 14:28.879
Or my husband and I were almost seeing something.

14:29.279 --> 14:32.864
But your eyes could even be on something, but you haven't seen it.

14:33.826 --> 14:36.730
And so he can't lie.

14:37.271 --> 14:39.614
That's the one legacy of his father.

14:39.654 --> 14:40.836
He just can't lie.

14:41.356 --> 14:42.818
Now somebody else might have lied.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.662
Because, in fact, it wasn't that much of a lie.

14:45.723 --> 14:50.609
It wasn't that much of a stretch to identify the car.

14:51.711 --> 14:54.595
But he couldn't lie.

14:55.030 --> 15:04.224
You aren't intimidated at all about, I mean, picking up the jargon, the talk of a guy like this.

15:04.244 --> 15:04.544
Oh, man.

15:04.564 --> 15:04.744
Yeah.

15:05.666 --> 15:05.986
Well, no.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.048
It's not phony at all.

15:07.068 --> 15:09.091
I have to say, I'm an old Navy guy.

15:09.531 --> 15:11.855
Oh, my God.

15:12.175 --> 15:22.050
And there's really nothing, there's really nothing gratuitous about the language, and you really, where do you go?

15:22.874 --> 15:45.821
How do you get this kind of... Well, as a writer, I'm very interested in how people talk, and I see American idiom as very beautiful, and the profanities and obscenities and the kind of weird metaphors and figures of speech that people use is really a kind of poetry.

15:45.841 --> 15:52.729
People may be offended by it, but if you look at black English, for instance, black English,

15:53.587 --> 15:55.609
meeting with African-American people.

15:55.629 --> 15:59.272
Right, African-American is really so poetic.

16:00.453 --> 16:10.763
And that language has so many tropes and similes and metaphors and witty conjunctions of words.

16:11.524 --> 16:14.607
And some of them are profane and some of them are obscene.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.551
But a lot of them are really right on target.

16:18.671 --> 16:21.113
A lot of them have to do with white people.

16:21.548 --> 16:32.799
So you look at this language and you think, this is really an incredibly beautiful, complicated, brilliant sub-language.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.320
It's not exactly English.

16:34.741 --> 16:38.765
It's African-American English.

16:38.945 --> 16:43.149
And there's a whole jargon of men talking to other men.

16:43.209 --> 16:47.573
And they don't talk that way usually when women are around or they don't talk that way to women.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.437
And that too is often very funny.

16:51.856 --> 16:59.304
very witty, seemingly vulgar and crude, but the men are communicating.

17:01.245 --> 17:04.689
And the function of language is communicating.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.832
But it's something a little different.

17:07.852 --> 17:20.665
So for me to work in Corky's idiomatic voice, which is very macho, and someone might say exaggerating, that was very exhilarating because it was as if I were exploring a language.

17:21.725 --> 17:26.009
that's not my own, and that people don't speak in principle.

17:26.029 --> 17:27.430
It's like I went on a journey.

17:29.372 --> 17:33.596
And so, I mean, I know how people do talk to some extent.

17:34.777 --> 17:42.184
I've also written a novel called Because It Is Bittering, Because It Is My Heart, that has a lot of black talk in it.

17:42.204 --> 17:43.285
These are black people.

17:44.186 --> 17:49.791
And there's a white family and a black family, and I sort of contrast that language.

17:50.699 --> 17:54.262
Anyway, for me as a writer, language is just so exciting.

17:54.843 --> 17:57.886
So the whole natural language I find is just wonderful.

17:58.727 --> 18:00.669
How do you acquire it?

18:01.409 --> 18:07.215
I mean, living in a lovely little village like Princeton or wherever, I mean, I think.

18:07.675 --> 18:08.917
Well, one, I mean, one.

18:08.937 --> 18:18.526
I mean, John, for instance, has really bemoaned the fact that, I mean, he's, I think he's almost as prolific as you are in terms of output.

18:18.546 --> 18:19.727
Oh, yeah, definitely.

18:19.893 --> 18:27.002
But he's bemoaned that he really doesn't get out and see the real world as much as he might.

18:27.763 --> 18:28.544
He could.

18:28.644 --> 18:30.066
I go to New York a lot.

18:30.086 --> 18:31.047
I have lots of friends.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.288
I'm involved in this theater.

18:32.509 --> 18:34.251
I'm teasing just a little bit now.

18:34.611 --> 18:35.292
I know John.

18:35.372 --> 18:38.777
He's a friend and we correspond a bit.

18:38.797 --> 18:43.943
But John does what he wants to do, basically, and he has a readership that

18:44.598 --> 18:47.883
and a constituency that likes what he does very much.

18:47.923 --> 18:54.412
So he's writing about a sort of upper middle class Caucasian world and those are the people who buy his books.

18:55.293 --> 19:01.903
If he were to be writing about something very different, he'd have to be a little stretch or a little prowling about his readership.

19:02.744 --> 19:08.412
I don't have any problem with trying to write for a certain readership because I don't think I have any.

19:08.628 --> 19:11.651
Stable readership.

19:11.771 --> 19:13.913
I have no idea who reads my books.

19:14.113 --> 19:14.933
I'm also surprised.

19:15.694 --> 19:17.035
You mentioned constituency.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.456
That was your work for John.

19:20.298 --> 19:24.141
Do you have a sense of what your constituency is?

19:26.623 --> 19:28.165
My novels are so different.

19:28.405 --> 19:34.730
I have a book on boxing, which has its own little life.

19:35.331 --> 19:37.673
There are people who read my book on boxing.

19:37.973 --> 19:40.636
who don't even read books.

19:40.656 --> 19:43.460
I mean, boxing, actually boxing.

19:44.421 --> 19:53.672
A very good friend of mine wrote a biography of Joaquin Marciano about 20 years ago, and he's familiar with your book on boxing.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.796
This is another example of the masculine world.

19:57.236 --> 20:02.723
My father took me to boxing matches when I was an old girl, and my father loved boxing.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.748
He had a good friend who was a professional middleweight out of Buffalo.

20:07.049 --> 20:08.972
who never got anywhere.

20:09.132 --> 20:10.634
In fact, he was injured in the ring.

20:11.275 --> 20:25.937
So for me, boxing is the sport that typifies masculinity, much more than football or baseball, because boxing was the sport of my childhood and my girlhood.

20:25.957 --> 20:33.107
And there's a whole world there and a language there, and boxers are very witty.

20:34.994 --> 20:41.442
Mike Tyson, for instance, was, or maybe he still is, a very funny person.

20:42.443 --> 20:45.607
In a group of people, Mike was funny.

20:46.148 --> 20:47.369
He'd make jokes.

20:47.830 --> 20:48.551
He was witty.

20:50.353 --> 20:53.697
Now, that doesn't come through in his public persona.

20:54.358 --> 20:59.444
He's branded now forever as a rapist and God knows what.

20:59.464 --> 21:01.727
As I had to say from Tyson, there was always this sense of menace.

21:02.281 --> 21:08.910
Maybe that contributed to the, maybe there was a surprise for McNuma, but, you know, being around Tyson.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.072
No.

21:10.092 --> 21:10.433
Really?

21:10.533 --> 21:10.733
No.

21:12.275 --> 21:15.239
You know, I went out to dinner with Mike and with his manager.

21:16.161 --> 21:18.384
No, that is sort of PR.

21:18.484 --> 21:19.205
Really?

21:19.766 --> 21:31.022
Now, if you met Mike in a different venue, you weren't in a midtown restaurant with him and his trainer, his manager, his co-manager, and his wife.

21:31.340 --> 21:43.273
I mean, if you met Mike when he was in another state, for instance, if you met Mike in a boxing ring and he's coming at you, he's a different person because he's a professional boxer.

21:43.974 --> 21:50.982
And people shouldn't be surprised that a professional boxer, heavyweight champion of the world, is medicine.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.283
Of course, he's deadly.

21:52.343 --> 21:53.324
He's like a killer.

21:53.404 --> 21:54.546
So is Jack Dempsey.

21:55.307 --> 22:01.093
But you take these people out of that professional ring and they're often very different.

22:01.478 --> 22:07.306
But the thing about Mike Tyson and about other Baptists whom I met is how smart they are.

22:08.387 --> 22:10.730
Their reputations for not being smart, very smart.

22:10.750 --> 22:11.932
I mean, look at Muhammad Ali.

22:14.635 --> 22:15.897
He was so sharp.

22:15.937 --> 22:16.678
He was fun.

22:16.698 --> 22:18.240
He was playful.

22:18.260 --> 22:20.062
A lot of playfulness there.

22:21.104 --> 22:29.595
There was a piece in the New York Times a week or so ago, and somebody went to Madonna's, the woman, the entertainer,

22:30.335 --> 22:32.177
her Manhattan apartment.

22:32.217 --> 22:37.823
Probably the place is lined with boxing photographs inscribed, and there's one from Ali.

22:37.843 --> 22:37.983
Really?

22:38.223 --> 22:40.786
Yeah, if I can find the piece, I'll send it to you.

22:40.826 --> 22:41.547
It was terrific.

22:42.048 --> 22:42.768
I missed that.

22:42.888 --> 22:44.851
It was a big, big piece in the New York Times.

22:45.291 --> 22:52.739
And then she had allowed the New York Times correspondent to come in, which is kind of unusual.

22:52.759 --> 23:00.207
But her favorite was the inscribed picture from Ali for Madonna, where both

23:00.727 --> 23:01.728
the greatest.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.770
We are the greatest.

23:03.551 --> 23:08.237
And they asked her, this is a great quote, what is it about boxing that you enjoy?

23:08.317 --> 23:10.380
And she says, the violence.

23:12.543 --> 23:13.844
The controlled violence.

23:13.864 --> 23:15.547
I don't even know what she called it, control.

23:16.167 --> 23:30.126
I understand, but I think she really likes this, maybe it was even the other side, I mean, uncontrolled, the actual, you know, it's

23:30.680 --> 23:35.487
It's competition taking, reduced to its basis the most basic elements, I guess.

23:35.507 --> 23:36.528
I love boxing.

23:36.548 --> 23:41.235
Well, I love it too, but right now it's actually wonderful, isn't it?

23:41.255 --> 23:41.835
It's terrible.

23:41.956 --> 23:43.558
There was a fight on a couple months ago.

23:43.618 --> 23:44.479
I called my father.

23:44.599 --> 23:45.200
He's 84.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.282
It was a fixed fight.

23:46.302 --> 23:47.083
It was terrible.

23:47.103 --> 23:51.549
It was this heavyweight fight that when I went down, it had to be fixed.

23:54.012 --> 23:57.497
When I was a kid, he wasn't a real...

23:58.051 --> 24:01.818
He wasn't real heavy, but he was small.

24:01.838 --> 24:02.298
Yeah.

24:03.561 --> 24:04.683
We could talk boxing all day.

24:04.703 --> 24:05.905
We could talk boxing all day.

24:05.925 --> 24:09.431
But Raffi Marciano is another example of someone who was small.

24:10.353 --> 24:15.081
Yeah, but he was a lot like Mike Tyson.

24:15.449 --> 24:18.474
He had this total killer instinct.

24:18.494 --> 24:21.258
That's right, but he wasn't as good a boxer as Mike.

24:21.378 --> 24:24.643
Mike had a really good defense, and Marciano didn't have a good defense.

24:24.683 --> 24:26.826
Marciano was basically a savage.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.689
Yeah, he was like Jack Dempsey.

24:29.190 --> 24:35.359
But when Mike Tyson was training seriously, he was a very sharp, defensive boxer.

24:35.419 --> 24:37.142
He was very, very defensive.

24:37.683 --> 24:38.744
Then he lost it all.

24:38.764 --> 24:41.929
He fired his trainers, you know, Kevin Rooney.

24:42.297 --> 24:46.042
He became a different kind of boxer, I think much less interesting.

24:46.522 --> 24:50.507
Some of this boxing stuff will get into my piece.

24:50.527 --> 24:51.428
Oh, it's fine.

24:51.728 --> 25:01.140
But don't you think it's just part of this interest in the masculine world, which has its own poetry, and I can see that it's a world different from my own.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.543
See, I'm interested in people, not myself.

25:03.823 --> 25:08.929
I feel I'm like a reporter or anthropologist.

25:10.782 --> 25:14.067
Some people get interested in birds, and they travel around the world.

25:14.107 --> 25:20.718
I have a friend who looks at rare birds and loves them and takes photographs, and I feel that way about human beings.

25:23.121 --> 25:31.174
I read in a—in fact, I read it last night again—the interview you did with Paris Review back in, I guess, was 70— Quite a while ago.

25:31.194 --> 25:36.823
I guess it was 78, and you were living up in Canada at that time.

25:37.394 --> 25:38.916
You were asked a couple questions.

25:38.956 --> 25:45.385
There was one novel, I guess, Wonderland, where you actually went back and rewrote the ending of it.

25:46.386 --> 25:47.848
The ending, yeah.

25:47.868 --> 25:53.876
Just coincidentally, I did an interview with Kim O'Brien a couple weeks ago, moved that around.

25:54.617 --> 26:04.971
He, for instance, said that even though 15 years after he had won the National Book Award for going after Cacciato, he actually went in and rewrote parts of it.

26:05.288 --> 26:08.711
I mean, the paperback that is out there right now is different.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.473
He said he gets letters from teachers all the time.

26:10.513 --> 26:13.056
He goes, hey, I'm using one book and the students do another.

26:14.117 --> 26:20.243
And I just, I know Henry James did like to, he couldn't keep his hands up and stuff.

26:20.263 --> 26:23.526
And his prefaces to the New York edition, for instance, are just wonderful.

26:23.867 --> 26:28.411
But while he was doing this, he did go in and gorby dallas, tinker a little bit.

26:28.892 --> 26:31.955
How do you feel about a finished work being a finished work?

26:32.015 --> 26:34.317
I mean, do you really think that it does represent your,

26:35.343 --> 27:01.266
your self as a writer at a particular point in your life and do you really feel that you should ever go back and tinker with things or do you feel on the other hand as O'Brien says I have an obligation to make the most beautiful work that I can you know I don't know it's just a general question well it's interesting about Tim O'Brien I teach the

27:01.651 --> 27:02.673
The Things They Carried.

27:02.793 --> 27:04.796
It's the long short story.

27:04.816 --> 27:09.844
Let me just interrupt and say, he said that now that this book is done, he's going to go back and fool around with that one again.

27:10.265 --> 27:11.026
The Things They Carried.

27:11.046 --> 27:11.787
Oh, The Things They Carried.

27:11.887 --> 27:16.675
I just was wondering whether he had altered that.

27:16.795 --> 27:18.818
He said he's about to alter that.

27:18.939 --> 27:25.629
Well, it's very beautiful, but if he puts more in it, that might make it better.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.654
I think the writers have to do what they...

27:29.123 --> 27:36.494
compelled to do, and that we already have some sense of being driven by inner and partly unconscious forces.

27:37.336 --> 27:48.112
It's the way in which people fall in love, let's say, and there are cycles in our lives where we become intensely interested and have dreams about an earlier period of our lives.

27:48.233 --> 27:57.527
Maybe we're 20 years old, maybe we're 30 years old, maybe we're dreaming about when we're 14, and I don't know why this comes up again and again,

27:57.845 --> 28:10.084
So I suppose with writers, there are works that inhabit their past that are living and vivid, and they start thinking about that, and now they feel that they could write it a little better.

28:10.144 --> 28:18.276
I often rewrite a short story completely after it's been published in a magazine.

28:18.617 --> 28:20.980
I mean, you're getting it ready for a collection.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.383
Getting it ready for a collection.

28:23.324 --> 28:24.366
It's different, I think.

28:25.347 --> 28:26.569
It's different.

28:27.241 --> 28:28.662
Maybe it's not, I'm just saying.

28:28.843 --> 28:31.145
But I think, I would think that's different.

28:31.845 --> 28:32.666
It's different.

28:32.786 --> 28:43.977
If you're taking a story that you did for a magazine and now, because in a collection, I know that you particularly like to have the stories, a certain theme for the stories.

28:44.077 --> 28:48.781
And so, you know, maybe it is necessary to make some alterations.

28:49.742 --> 28:50.863
I think that's different.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.665
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

28:52.785 --> 28:54.186
It is different.

28:54.426 --> 28:54.987
It's different in a way.

28:55.591 --> 29:00.698
If there's a continuum, it's on that continuum, but it's at an extreme, obviously.

29:00.718 --> 29:08.208
But to rewrite a published book is more of a commitment, obviously, and many people have done it.

29:09.169 --> 29:13.916
And sometimes it's a good idea, sometimes it may not be.

29:13.936 --> 29:19.543
My friend Toni Morrison insists that she's going to be rewriting The Bluest Eye.

29:20.945 --> 29:24.670
And I said to Toni, please don't, because it's a beautiful novel.

29:25.645 --> 29:27.447
She's not going to listen to me.

29:27.467 --> 29:29.410
She's got her own inner voice.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.092
Now, why do you think that is?

29:31.172 --> 29:34.136
And this is not for my story, but I'm just curious.

29:34.156 --> 29:36.500
Because writers are stubborn.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.801
Toni's stubborn.

29:37.881 --> 29:39.103
She has her own inner voice.

29:39.804 --> 29:43.149
If she wants to rewrite her first novel, she's going to do it.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.972
She's not going to listen to other people.

29:45.992 --> 29:53.863
When I rewrote the ending of Wonderland, it was a very raw and somewhat crude

29:54.468 --> 30:05.401
inchoate part of my life where I was having many emotions and going through an emotional turbulence that I don't have now.

30:06.523 --> 30:21.561
So the original ending for Wonderland had seemed like the inevitable ending, but then some months later I believed that I understood the real ending and why this was.

30:21.621 --> 30:22.102
I don't know.

30:22.542 --> 30:23.884
My publishers are very

30:24.404 --> 30:27.729
sympathetic and very patient with me.

30:27.749 --> 30:41.908
But with a novel like What I Lived For, written in a more mature time, one might say I would never let it go out of the house until I was absolutely certain that I'd finished it.

30:42.689 --> 30:47.096
And when I was a younger writer, I didn't have that perspective.

30:48.377 --> 30:53.905
I might finish a novel and send it off to my publisher within a month.

30:54.644 --> 30:59.932
But now I keep the work around much longer, maybe six months.

30:59.972 --> 31:15.195
You said in this interview, and I wonder if this is still the way you work, you will finish a novel, put it away, go to work on something else, perhaps some stories or another novel, and then go back.

31:15.335 --> 31:16.076
Back and back.

31:16.096 --> 31:18.159
Is this still the procedure that you've done?

31:18.179 --> 31:18.379
Oh, yeah.

31:18.399 --> 31:19.721
To me, that's very comfortable.

31:20.302 --> 31:23.487
Because once I get out of the novel and into another consciousness,

31:23.821 --> 31:29.147
and then go back to it, I have much more critical detachment.

31:29.167 --> 31:32.771
And then you had said also, pardon me for bringing up the old, I am interested in craft.

31:33.612 --> 31:38.738
You actually had started, I mean, you talk about going in a different direction.

31:39.359 --> 31:47.429
I guess in your earlier years, you used to write on a typewriter, and then you changed over to handwritten manuscripts.

31:48.330 --> 31:51.554
I wonder now, have you entered the word processor generation?

31:52.034 --> 31:53.676
No, I don't use a word processor.

31:54.044 --> 31:56.548
I sit and write by long hand.

31:56.568 --> 31:59.272
I was working on a poem this morning.

31:59.732 --> 32:02.416
I like to write with my own handwriting.

32:03.498 --> 32:05.681
All of what I lived for was in handwriting.

32:05.701 --> 32:05.961
Really?

32:07.043 --> 32:15.195
But in a kind of informal way, like a piece of paper that are folded over, and I write that way.

32:15.615 --> 32:18.179
But to me, it's just a comfortable way of writing.

32:19.060 --> 32:22.245
I had a word processor for two years, and I became so

32:23.120 --> 32:29.049
obsessed with it and I was working much longer than I should have every day, sometimes past midnight.

32:30.070 --> 32:42.889
I was fascinated by the screen and staring and mesmerized and I thought I don't want to live the rest of my life being hypnotized by the screen, staring at a screen for 12 hours of a day.

32:42.909 --> 32:50.460
So I got rid of the word processor and now I look out the window again and I write in longhand and I have a

32:50.930 --> 32:51.891
a nice typewriter.

32:52.272 --> 32:56.537
It's a very handsome, state-of-the-art typewriter.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.881
So then I typed, but I can look out the window.

32:59.361 --> 33:01.164
To me that's very important.

33:01.184 --> 33:07.933
There was a study, I'm told about the study, Joe Finder told me about it, at Harvard or MIT.

33:08.834 --> 33:20.329
Apparently, and I believe this because I write entirely on a word process, and I see my stuff every week, so I see how it looks in print, and I also see how it looks on a screen.

33:20.579 --> 33:25.026
And I also see, and I print it out, and so I see how it looks on the manuscript page.

33:25.827 --> 33:32.438
And it looks different, and it reads differently, and I think it impacts people differently.

33:32.518 --> 33:39.589
And there have been studies which apparently validate this, that what you write on a screen, you really can't.

33:39.609 --> 33:43.756
I know Dr. Roble, I interviewed earlier this summer for the new novel.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.941
He writes in the word processing, but he prints it out.

33:47.242 --> 33:51.929
And he said he has to do the editing on the page because it's different.

33:52.370 --> 33:56.696
It's totally different from the way it looks on the screen, and you're saying different things.

33:56.796 --> 33:59.020
It is interesting how language comes to you.

33:59.060 --> 34:07.492
The words can be the same, but the effect, the impact will be totally different just by the medium to which you can get it.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.036
So true, so true, and also the type thought.

34:10.056 --> 34:11.799
The thought is so important, isn't it?

34:11.959 --> 34:14.683
The quality of the pages.

34:15.052 --> 34:19.899
If there's an elegant font and handsome paper, it makes a big difference.

34:21.521 --> 34:22.683
I don't know what the number.

34:22.783 --> 34:28.632
I could have counted them, I guess, but do you have a count of how many books that you have now?

34:28.832 --> 34:39.207
Well, books and titles are somewhat different because some of the titles refer to novellas or even short stories that have been special auditions, so it's hard to have a count.

34:41.771 --> 34:44.535
A library may have 95 items in that.

34:45.022 --> 34:51.091
But some of them are just short stories that are special editions.

34:51.772 --> 34:55.958
That's why a quantitative figure is misleading.

34:56.499 --> 34:57.380
Twenty-four novels.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.864
Amazing.

34:59.984 --> 35:02.688
Some of them are short.

35:02.708 --> 35:05.552
Some of them are very short.

35:05.852 --> 35:13.223
I'm sure you are inevitably asked the question, how is it that you can possibly maintain this kind of a fate?

35:13.979 --> 35:18.986
Well, I love writing, I love language, and as I said, you know, I get fascinated by people.

35:20.247 --> 35:22.550
So for me it's excitement and pleasure.

35:22.590 --> 35:29.860
And there's never a, there's no shortage of ideas, apparently.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.903
No, no, I have many, many more ideas.

35:32.003 --> 35:37.910
I have so many outlines and sketches for novels and short stories I'll never live to write.

35:38.611 --> 35:41.455
You mentioned correctly that Updike,

35:41.975 --> 35:48.745
That's just an example, but he does tend to write about a certain white middle class.

35:48.765 --> 35:50.628
Generally, except for Brazil.

35:51.089 --> 35:53.513
Brazil, which is a little different.

35:53.533 --> 35:54.194
A little different.

35:54.775 --> 36:02.627
Tim O'Brien, to name another, writes five out of six books that all had Vietnam themes.

36:04.069 --> 36:08.115
But you, on the other hand, cover the waterfront, so to speak.

36:08.155 --> 36:09.417
I guess what I'm asking is,

36:09.785 --> 36:12.929
Do you see your work as a corpus?

36:13.149 --> 36:14.551
Probably, I think so.

36:14.591 --> 36:18.276
I always read about things that I've experienced emotionally.

36:18.376 --> 36:23.562
It was Goethe who said he'd never written about anything he hadn't experienced.

36:23.582 --> 36:29.129
I suppose he meant by that he hadn't experienced in some emotional way.

36:29.189 --> 36:38.020
We've all had experiences of love and betrayal and losing someone whom we love to death.

36:38.337 --> 36:41.922
We don't necessarily have to write about ourselves, our own experiences.

36:42.002 --> 36:48.851
We can give those experiences to fictitious people, and I think that's what writers do, or some writers anyway.

36:49.492 --> 37:02.309
Obviously for Tim O'Brien, the Vietnam War came at a time in his young manhood, when he was just out of college, and anything at that time would have been so vivid and powerful to him.

37:03.431 --> 37:06.775
And then added to that the trauma of the war, so that's the most

37:09.117 --> 37:10.779
dynamic part of his life.

37:11.981 --> 37:20.211
He said, and I really challenged him on this, and I pushed him on it, and he said, this is the last book I'm going to write.

37:20.231 --> 37:21.032
I'm not writing anymore.

37:21.052 --> 37:21.893
I said, I don't believe it.

37:21.913 --> 37:24.997
I mean, he's gone through some personal, which he outlined in the New York Times.

37:25.017 --> 37:25.839
I know, I read that.

37:25.859 --> 37:28.802
Which I was a little disappointed to see that.

37:28.822 --> 37:34.770
I mean, there were certain things that you'd like to see people resolve in their own without having to

37:36.134 --> 37:38.819
But in any case, let me talk a little bit about that.

37:38.939 --> 37:43.126
But he did say, this is the best book.

37:43.146 --> 37:47.113
He said, I'm not capable of writing a better book than this.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.179
And I said, you're a young guy.

37:50.199 --> 37:51.141
You're younger than I am.

37:52.683 --> 37:58.193
I said, I have to believe that you're going through something that you're going to deal with.

37:58.679 --> 38:00.682
and that you're going to come back to this.

38:00.762 --> 38:05.027
And he said, well, maybe 15 years from now I'll change my mind.

38:05.047 --> 38:07.390
But he said, I don't know what to write about.

38:08.271 --> 38:14.059
And I quoted him on that, and that's quite a startling thing to say.

38:14.139 --> 38:16.722
I'm not asking you to comment on O'Brien.

38:16.742 --> 38:17.944
I'll comment on Tim O'Brien.

38:18.144 --> 38:27.336
One day Tim O'Brien will wake up from a night of extraordinary dreams and have a new idea for a new novel, and he'll write it, and it will be wonderful.

38:28.852 --> 38:30.994
We can't predict what we're going to do.

38:31.354 --> 38:33.877
But Tim O'Brien loves language, and he's a writer.

38:33.937 --> 38:45.467
He thinks that he's exhausted his subject, but his subject actually is something much more compelling and deeper than just a surface subject.

38:45.487 --> 38:48.130
It actually has to do his own spiritual reality.

38:48.570 --> 38:49.391
You're saying exactly what he said.

38:49.411 --> 38:53.575
He said, I use Vietnam to develop moral choice.

38:54.455 --> 38:55.496
That's right.

38:55.516 --> 38:57.238
He said Updike uses suburbia.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.854
He said, I use Vietnam.

38:59.874 --> 39:13.106
My books draw on my Vietnam experience because it was a defining event of my generation and my life, but I use it to express my feelings of moral choice.

39:13.666 --> 39:16.489
And I think if you read this book, you agree.

39:16.829 --> 39:17.570
Absolutely.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.993
He came to Princeton and read from the new novel.

39:21.013 --> 39:24.876
He was my, I mean, I invited him and I introduced him.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.618
He's a wonderful writer.

39:26.767 --> 39:41.607
I love this book, too, and it's getting, he was victimized by an unfortunate, he's funny, you know, I mean, this particular novel, he did in two different, I've got two different sets of reader's proofs on this, I mean, he kept changing it right up until the end.

39:41.628 --> 39:43.750
I heard that, but I don't know about that.

39:43.770 --> 39:52.302
Yeah, and he said, the first one was done, because for the ABA, they wanted to pass it around, and I think it was that one that P.W.

39:52.543 --> 39:53.584
used for its review.

39:55.943 --> 39:57.645
revisions subsequent to that.

39:58.306 --> 40:00.569
I like the book, and I agree with him.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.052
He said, every mystery doesn't have a solution.

40:04.254 --> 40:05.856
It's much more realistic.

40:05.876 --> 40:10.162
And he said, you know, why are we so fascinated with Amelia Earhart?

40:10.863 --> 40:12.946
And why did they make a movie of JFK?

40:12.966 --> 40:15.068
Because Lizzie Borden, you know?

40:15.349 --> 40:17.191
Because there is a mystery we don't know.

40:17.331 --> 40:17.672
That's right.

40:17.692 --> 40:19.314
That's much more true to real life.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.238
And, you know, it's a very powerful

40:22.792 --> 40:25.995
Tell me, by the way, what your schedule is, if I'm running out of time.

40:26.095 --> 40:27.317
Well, until about 10.30.

40:27.377 --> 40:27.837
Okay.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.039
I'm sorry to be jumping around here.

40:30.380 --> 40:33.082
Well, we'd love to talk about vaccines.

40:33.122 --> 40:34.904
We could talk about vaccines around.

40:34.984 --> 40:35.485
We could.

40:35.765 --> 40:40.530
I've got plenty of stuff, but I just want to make sure.

40:42.231 --> 40:49.879
There was a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker, taken 25 years ago, framed, you know, that showed a guy in a

40:50.281 --> 40:55.046
a hammock out in his yard and his wife is looking at him, you know, what are you doing?

40:55.267 --> 41:01.974
And basically the caption is, listen, a writer isn't always writing when he's writing for that one.

41:02.375 --> 41:03.496
Is that basically true?

41:03.556 --> 41:04.657
Are you always writing?

41:04.677 --> 41:07.220
I mean, this is a 24-hour-a-day job.

41:07.240 --> 41:07.881
I don't think so.

41:07.941 --> 41:12.125
I'm always thinking about writing, about ideas.

41:12.766 --> 41:16.170
I'm working on a poem now, and I started going through the poem.

41:16.437 --> 41:17.258
in my head.

41:17.298 --> 41:21.481
It's the sort of thing that one can do when one is traveling or in a hotel room.

41:21.501 --> 41:27.607
So if I was over in a public garden running around early this morning, and these lines are going through my head.

41:29.268 --> 41:38.176
But after one finishes a long novel, like what I lived for, or Tim O'Brien's novel, there's such a feeling afterward of being depleted.

41:38.837 --> 41:41.399
And you can't think of another long novel.

41:41.479 --> 41:42.800
You just can't think of it.

41:43.521 --> 41:45.162
It's as if you've swum across

41:45.530 --> 41:53.281
a turbulent river, and you've just made it to the other side, and you're lying on the bank, gasping, you're not going to think about swimming bad.

41:53.942 --> 42:00.832
You're not going to think about swimming at all, but you might do some little things, and I think that's what we're all doing.

42:01.133 --> 42:12.870
There was an interesting quote, again, in that Paris review piece, where you said that so much of your fiction kind of develops from dreams.

42:13.171 --> 42:13.832
Sometimes.

42:13.852 --> 42:15.194
Take notes, you wake up.

42:15.214 --> 42:15.795
Sometimes.

42:17.337 --> 42:19.740
But those are often the hardest stories to write.

42:20.841 --> 42:21.703
They're very hard.

42:22.364 --> 42:27.471
I work with a dream image and how to integrate that into a realistic story.

42:28.232 --> 42:36.463
I've actually worked harder using a dream image than I would have been if I just invented something.

42:36.483 --> 42:38.285
So I don't really like doing that.

42:38.746 --> 42:41.710
I worked very hard for weeks and weeks on a short story.

42:42.415 --> 42:44.377
that was generated by a dream.

42:46.760 --> 42:55.189
It's almost as if you're walking in the street, somebody hands you a slip of paper with an idea on it, and you look at this, and you think, I'm supposed to write a story about this?

42:55.769 --> 42:57.351
And you have no idea how you can do it.

42:57.431 --> 42:59.453
That's what it is to get an idea from the dream.

43:00.294 --> 43:01.695
It's actually very difficult.

43:03.838 --> 43:05.860
Have you ever read Lessons of the Golden?

43:06.020 --> 43:06.460
Oh, yeah.

43:07.101 --> 43:07.862
Years ago.

43:07.942 --> 43:10.785
That was 62, and the concept there is that

43:11.390 --> 43:13.873
man and woman exchange for sentences, remember?

43:14.995 --> 43:15.456
Yeah, yeah.

43:15.476 --> 43:17.558
I'll give you the first sentence.

43:17.598 --> 43:19.100
The first sentence up there.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.743
I asked her about that the other day.

43:20.763 --> 43:24.368
It's an interesting idea.

43:24.388 --> 43:28.774
Could you think, as you just said, you pick up something and somebody will do a story on this?

43:28.794 --> 43:28.994
Yeah.

43:29.234 --> 43:30.756
That would be kind of interesting.

43:30.977 --> 43:34.381
It would be quite a challenge.

43:34.882 --> 43:37.365
Doris Lexington was a young woman then.

43:37.405 --> 43:40.890
She was in love with and living with a man who was a writer.

43:41.782 --> 43:43.464
whose name I actually know.

43:44.145 --> 43:48.911
And so they were so close, you know, emotionally in all kinds of ways, very close.

43:48.931 --> 43:50.833
They were both writers, both obsessive.

43:51.414 --> 43:57.722
And so to exchange the sentences between those two had a special meaning.

43:57.742 --> 44:01.947
And maybe Doris herself has repudiated it all, you know.

44:02.027 --> 44:03.128
That's an excellent point.

44:03.288 --> 44:05.371
Because she's so different.

44:05.391 --> 44:11.198
So maybe there was a sim-symbiotic kind of relationship there, where that would be possible, I guess.

44:12.241 --> 44:18.110
But she, like many of us, as we get older, she sort of repudiates her early herself, I think.

44:18.751 --> 44:20.273
Have you read the memoir yet?

44:21.635 --> 44:22.997
I haven't read the memoir.

44:23.598 --> 44:29.186
The Globe gave it a pretty nasty review, and boy, if you go by the reviews, and I've been in this business.

44:29.266 --> 44:30.488
They're so misleading.

44:30.848 --> 44:38.940
I was prepared to find none of the humor in this book, and the woman who reviewed it,

44:43.460 --> 44:53.075
I'm sometimes surprised that reviewers are so thoughtful because many reviewers don't have time to read more than once.

44:53.476 --> 45:01.268
I think most works necessitate one's reading twice to do a review or an essay.

45:01.749 --> 45:05.635
But I'm often surprised at how sensitive reviewers are.

45:06.175 --> 45:10.362
They pick up meanings that I put in and they get the right interpretation.

45:10.645 --> 45:13.649
I mean, I'm less surprised when a review is careless.

45:13.669 --> 45:18.536
It seems to me to be part of the whole genre of reviewing where one is in a hurry.

45:19.577 --> 45:25.505
But I'm very grateful for the serious reviews.

45:25.525 --> 45:26.967
Do the bad ones bother you?

45:28.149 --> 45:29.230
It's hard to say.

45:29.291 --> 45:36.781
I think that I've been made stronger by having a good or very harsh criticism when I started out as a writer.

45:37.502 --> 45:39.825
I was writing about themes that were not

45:40.025 --> 45:43.269
perceived as proper for a woman to write about.

45:43.389 --> 45:49.476
Because I began writing in the early 1960s, and so there wasn't any women's relations.

45:49.496 --> 45:51.979
There wasn't any concept of feminism.

45:51.999 --> 46:01.731
If a woman was writing about themes of violence or masculine activity, she was perceived to have transgressed and to be writing out of her element.

46:01.751 --> 46:05.015
So I got a lot of very, very negative reviews.

46:06.297 --> 46:09.981
But I think, on the whole, it was probably good for me.

46:11.193 --> 46:13.937
because I wasn't going to change my subject.

46:14.057 --> 46:16.059
I never had changed at all.

46:16.660 --> 46:18.383
But then I'd be more prepared.

46:18.403 --> 46:30.699
I think, well, if I write a novel about the Duterte riots, which I did, called Them, I'll be writing about men, and I probably will get a lot of abusive reviews, but I think it's worth it.

46:31.059 --> 46:35.225
So I'd be making more of a moral decision before I began a subject.

46:35.245 --> 46:36.687
I didn't go into it blindly.

46:37.207 --> 46:39.951
I would make a kind of decision ahead of time,

46:40.302 --> 46:45.912
And I would think, well, I will make it as good a novel as I can if I'm going to write about men.

46:46.633 --> 46:51.562
I'll try to make them complex and real.

46:53.024 --> 46:57.833
So I think, on the whole, that's been helpful.

46:58.393 --> 47:00.437
Interesting quote from Alexander Thrillwhite.

47:00.856 --> 47:03.459
That's a nice book, isn't it?

47:03.499 --> 47:03.879
Yeah.

47:04.059 --> 47:05.040
We have the same editor.

47:05.060 --> 47:07.523
I have a book coming out from Hope next year.

47:07.723 --> 47:11.207
It's a book on Bibliomania on Book Mantis.

47:11.927 --> 47:15.030
Oh, great.

47:15.771 --> 47:23.259
But anyway, Alex mentioned these essays that he wrote, and he said, I really didn't, because they do have an unusual texture to them.

47:23.539 --> 47:24.920
Oh, they're completely unique.

47:24.940 --> 47:27.543
Yeah, and I said, how did that happen?

47:27.563 --> 47:29.445
He said, you know, I didn't start them, I entered them.

47:30.607 --> 47:35.613
It was very interesting that I tried to write the piece about him.

47:35.633 --> 47:37.215
I always like to pick up a little something.

47:37.235 --> 47:41.680
I said, let's see if I can enter this particular essay about, just enter the discussion.

47:42.401 --> 47:43.683
And it's an interesting idea.

47:43.763 --> 47:46.246
And then all of a sudden it builds around.

47:46.406 --> 47:49.530
But if you notice, it really doesn't have a proper beginning.

47:50.050 --> 47:51.893
No, it's meditative.

47:51.913 --> 47:58.120
And I always find it very hard to review that book, because it's a unique book.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.702
I think it's very beautiful.

48:01.353 --> 48:03.837
It's a very beautiful book and very original.

48:04.758 --> 48:10.006
And it's amazing that it hadn't really been done before, on the primary colors.

48:10.246 --> 48:15.373
Well, Alexander Terrell is really writing about the experience of his life.

48:15.634 --> 48:20.541
All these associations are coming out of him.

48:21.542 --> 48:26.069
It's as if he were writing a memoir using this as a sort of tuning for it.

48:26.790 --> 48:28.412
So it's really unique.

48:28.432 --> 48:29.554
It's quite unique.

48:29.973 --> 48:31.675
Just one final question.

48:31.695 --> 48:38.241
Do you read any particular authors for pleasure?

48:39.122 --> 48:43.406
I read almost everything for pleasure.

48:43.987 --> 48:47.310
Last night I was sitting here, these books came in the hotel room.

48:47.430 --> 48:54.718
I know, and there are books in there which I think have not been touched for a long time.

48:55.759 --> 48:59.963
They basically read almost everything for pleasure and edification.

49:00.297 --> 49:03.040
I read all the time because I see this reading.

49:06.004 --> 49:09.067
When you first started writing, you would write novels and throw them away.

49:10.849 --> 49:11.430
That's right.

49:11.450 --> 49:13.412
Do you still throw stuff away?

49:13.432 --> 49:15.034
No, I don't do that anymore.

49:15.054 --> 49:16.596
I think I was learning how to write.

49:17.096 --> 49:20.580
I was in college and I would write on scrap paper.

49:21.481 --> 49:27.088
I was sort of learning like a young pianist playing for scales.

49:27.528 --> 49:30.051
There were exercises.

49:31.448 --> 49:36.114
I did this week's Publishers Weekly interview with Tobias Wolfe.

49:36.355 --> 49:37.076
Oh, really?

49:37.356 --> 49:40.140
Gosh, you're meeting all my friends.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.042
It's a small world.

49:42.123 --> 49:48.391
It is, but when you're interested in quality writers, there really aren't all that many either, you know?

49:50.073 --> 49:52.276
But anyway, Toby had mentioned it.

49:52.296 --> 49:58.705
He allowed me to use it in the piece when he was writing, writing, writing, and he would throw stuff away.

49:59.292 --> 50:04.138
He wrote three novels when he was living out in San Francisco, and I put this in the tea.

50:04.338 --> 50:06.281
I ran it by him first, I called him.

50:06.982 --> 50:09.945
One of the books was bought by Ellen in England.

50:10.526 --> 50:11.527
Nobody knows about it.

50:11.547 --> 50:13.129
He wouldn't even tell me the title of it.

50:13.750 --> 50:14.431
I said, why not?

50:14.451 --> 50:15.913
He said, because I'm embarrassed by it.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.815
And hear his own name?

50:17.875 --> 50:20.218
We could find out what I mean.

50:20.759 --> 50:22.601
So he doesn't list it in his credits.

50:22.641 --> 50:24.203
He doesn't list it.

50:24.804 --> 50:25.485
Fascinating.

50:25.837 --> 50:37.371
The theme of preserving the past, you know, restrict the core with me, because when I'm writing a novel like this one, I am memorializing that world, and the world won't be there forever.

50:37.491 --> 50:49.987
So, like your friend, or your friend, who stole the books, I too am trying to preserve some chunk of history.

50:50.007 --> 50:52.570
It's the same thing.
