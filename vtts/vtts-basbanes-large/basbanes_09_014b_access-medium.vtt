00:02.798 --> 00:05.882
33 books for you now, Mr. Francis.

00:05.902 --> 00:06.783
33 books.

00:07.504 --> 00:18.017
How is it that you keep managing to come up with so many, I don't know, one just has to try and think of something.

00:18.137 --> 00:30.072
And when my wife and I, Felix, we went to Australia and New Zealand last October, November, and we came back via

00:30.811 --> 00:31.352
Hollywood.

00:32.274 --> 00:37.343
Spent a few days there at the Universal Studios and they were wonderful to us.

00:38.004 --> 00:47.702
Hoping to get perhaps some of my books on the films but nothing's happened yet but anyhow I thought there was an idea for the next story.

00:48.123 --> 00:53.072
I was thinking about an American film company coming over to England to make a racing film.

00:53.828 --> 00:58.396
The book just proved all right, I think.

00:58.416 --> 01:01.561
But, so therefore, you have a very agreeable muse.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.066
I mean, everything is grist for the mill, I guess.

01:04.126 --> 01:05.969
That way, then.

01:05.989 --> 01:06.269
Oh, yeah.

01:06.289 --> 01:06.390
Yeah.

01:06.770 --> 01:12.200
Well, every story I write, I research the subject.

01:12.220 --> 01:13.482
And my wife helps.

01:13.582 --> 01:16.747
She loves researching these subjects, too.

01:16.768 --> 01:17.068
And, uh,

01:17.960 --> 01:21.024
They've proved beneficial so far.

01:21.044 --> 01:24.488
Have you ever thought of not doing anything with horses?

01:25.529 --> 01:31.937
I suggested it to Mrs. Michael Joseph, who is now dead, about 16 or 17 years ago.

01:31.957 --> 01:37.744
She said, if I write a book that hasn't got horses or racing in it, will you publish it?

01:37.764 --> 01:41.408
And she said, after a while, she said, yes, we'll publish anything you write.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.050
We'd rather you live and do so.

01:43.911 --> 01:47.916
Your readers would be disappointed if they weren't learning.

01:48.200 --> 02:16.620
something about the racing scene and uh i i join the racing scene to something else such as pharmacology or merchant banking or photography or computers you know and you know it's nice to do well my wife and i have done research on wines and spirits for about 48 years

02:16.904 --> 02:18.866
And I've brought that into proof.

02:19.046 --> 02:22.330
So it goes on.

02:22.691 --> 02:26.455
Now, you don't have a continuing character.

02:26.475 --> 02:29.418
No, I've repeated two characters twice.

02:30.319 --> 02:33.042
But I don't like that.

02:33.182 --> 02:40.331
I don't consider myself a born novelist, you might say.

02:40.351 --> 02:46.017
And I find introducing a character and talking about its characteristics.

02:46.975 --> 02:51.421
throughout the story, hosting is all the book out.

02:51.441 --> 03:11.808
So, therefore, it's... You find it a lot easier to create a new character, I mean, a protagonist every time of... Yes, because if you've had one continuing character, like, you know, whoever, I mean, you pretty much have to remember what you've done in the 23 previous installments, I guess.

03:12.870 --> 03:16.695
But that's very interesting, I guess, where you are writing...

03:17.198 --> 03:18.700
in the genre, I guess.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.602
Would you consider yourself a genre writer?

03:21.884 --> 03:31.236
It's a word I don't like, but I suppose I am, yes.

03:31.276 --> 03:36.102
Lots of people say I'm a mystery writer and a crime writer.

03:36.122 --> 03:39.026
I belong to the mystery writers of America.

03:39.126 --> 03:41.469
I belong to the crime writers of England.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.855
I consider myself more an adventure story writer.

03:46.038 --> 04:07.964
I'd like to bring in some of the experiences I've had into the stories and adventures such as in Norway, in the sea, North Sea oil and smokescreen.

04:08.064 --> 04:14.712
That's brought in quite a lot about the Kruger Park Game Reserve in South Africa where my wife and I went for

04:15.367 --> 04:16.689
a long weekend.

04:16.909 --> 04:28.064
I went out to judge at the International Horse Show Johannesburg and one of the carrots dangled in front of me was, oh, we'll give you a weekend at the Cougar Park game reserve.

04:28.084 --> 04:32.089
So I went and it was very interesting.

04:32.149 --> 04:34.012
I brought that into smokescreen.

04:34.753 --> 04:36.956
Do you still enjoy horse racing?

04:37.576 --> 04:38.938
I do, yes.

04:39.619 --> 04:42.703
I enjoy people chasing.

04:42.843 --> 04:43.264
I don't

04:43.750 --> 04:45.954
enjoy flat racing all that much.

04:45.974 --> 04:52.446
One likes, I like to go to a place like Royal Ascot where there are four days.

04:52.486 --> 04:54.270
Where is this again?

04:54.290 --> 04:57.296
Royal Ascot, Royal Ascot.

04:57.356 --> 05:00.301
There are four wonderful days racing.

05:00.361 --> 05:06.012
There are six races each day and they're all superb top-class races.

05:06.262 --> 05:11.551
I don't care if I don't see the races, but I like to see the horses parading in the parade ring.

05:11.571 --> 05:13.734
How about the people that they attract?

05:14.395 --> 05:20.225
A lot of people go there for the fashion and the social scene.

05:21.006 --> 05:27.797
But there are people who, equestrian people who know what about horses go.

05:28.250 --> 05:31.273
Now, of course, you said you're not a born novelist.

05:31.293 --> 05:34.556
I don't know if there's any such thing as a born novelist.

05:35.197 --> 05:35.838
Probably not.

05:35.918 --> 05:40.623
But you're never really trained to be or even conceived of being a professional writer.

05:40.643 --> 05:42.124
You were a jockey, right?

05:42.144 --> 05:43.346
Yes, I was.

05:43.586 --> 05:47.310
When I was young, I didn't do a lot of reading.

05:50.793 --> 05:54.477
During the winter, the fox hunting was in our area.

05:54.946 --> 05:59.272
And Mondays and Fridays were always days when they weren't very far away.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.795
And I went to day school.

06:01.055 --> 06:04.280
I didn't go away to boarding school.

06:04.300 --> 06:09.247
And Monday mornings and Friday mornings, I used to come down before breakfast.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.269
Can I go hunting, Dad?

06:11.110 --> 06:13.113
And more often than not, he'd say, push, cowboy.

06:13.153 --> 06:16.338
And then he and Mother would have great arguments.

06:16.358 --> 06:17.720
She said, you've got to go to school to learn.

06:18.801 --> 06:22.607
She taught me a lot by making...

06:22.908 --> 06:27.314
I rode ponies for a lot of people in the show ring and won prizes.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.258
I suppose I was quite good at it.

06:30.278 --> 06:33.102
And I won a lot of prizes and they'd give you presents.

06:33.122 --> 06:39.070
Your cufflinks and your watches and things like that.

06:39.230 --> 06:46.800
And my mother insisted that as soon as I received the present I sat down and wrote a letter to these people.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.342
And it had to be...

06:48.440 --> 06:52.223
A proper letter, you know, no mistakes.

06:52.243 --> 06:59.270
One particular letter I wrote to Lord Camoy's daughter, the Honorable Noreen Stoner.

07:00.451 --> 07:05.815
She gave me some lovely gold cufflinks.

07:05.835 --> 07:09.739
And I wrote three letters, and Mother read them.

07:10.820 --> 07:16.945
No, no, there's something wrong again, so I had to write another one, four, and I wrote five, and

07:17.498 --> 07:41.194
mother's read it and she said well i think that's all right you can go to bed now and she said just let me look at that once more so i thought just she looked at it and all the others i'd been writing dear miss stoner well this one i've got dear stoner so she said you go to bed and write it in the morning but funny enough

07:42.220 --> 07:47.028
About five or six years ago, I met this Mrs. Stoner that was.

07:47.048 --> 07:50.674
I met her in Florida, and I told her about this.

07:50.775 --> 07:52.297
She's now Mrs. Drexel.

07:52.317 --> 07:56.204
She comes from Rhode Island.

07:56.264 --> 08:00.972
She was so amused about it.

08:01.795 --> 08:03.818
Let's see, you had a couple of bad falls, right?

08:03.838 --> 08:07.182
I mean, I guess it was kind of... Well, you get quite a few falls.

08:07.202 --> 08:10.546
It was almost a near catastrophe that actually moved you into the riding game.

08:10.566 --> 08:11.547
Is that right?

08:11.888 --> 08:13.950
Well, that wasn't really a fall.

08:13.990 --> 08:18.456
That was when the horse collapsed for me in the Grand National, the Queen Mother's horse.

08:18.516 --> 08:21.760
You were actually leading the race, isn't that right?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.603
I was about 10 minutes in front.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.485
It was 25 yards to go.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.747
And it was the Queen Mother's horse?

08:26.767 --> 08:27.528
The Queen Mother's horse.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.389
What was the name of the horse?

08:28.729 --> 08:29.490
Devon Lock.

08:29.808 --> 08:33.291
E-V-O-N-L-O-C-H.

08:33.311 --> 08:36.534
And he was winning it easily.

08:36.674 --> 08:40.758
And it was before the days that the races were televised.

08:40.918 --> 08:45.042
And there were a quarter of a million people at Aintree that day all around the course.

08:45.062 --> 08:47.044
It was a two-mile circuit, you see.

08:47.564 --> 08:52.529
And you go twice this round, four and a half miles.

08:52.769 --> 08:53.750
That's a long race.

08:53.770 --> 08:54.090
It is.

08:54.170 --> 08:55.231
It's the longest.

08:55.411 --> 08:56.472
It happens every year.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.233
It's a great race.

08:57.415 --> 08:58.616
And what's the name of the race again?

08:58.656 --> 08:59.918
Grand National.

08:59.938 --> 09:00.659
Oh, that's famous.

09:00.739 --> 09:01.640
And what was that held?

09:01.880 --> 09:02.420
Aintree.

09:02.521 --> 09:03.742
Aintree.

09:03.822 --> 09:04.282
Aintree.

09:04.463 --> 09:06.024
Aintree.

09:06.044 --> 09:06.205
Aintree.

09:06.565 --> 09:07.005
Aintree.

09:07.206 --> 09:07.666
Aintree.

09:07.746 --> 09:08.127
Aintree.

09:08.607 --> 09:08.988
Aintree.

09:09.028 --> 09:09.368
Aintree.

09:09.408 --> 09:09.688
Aintree.

09:09.708 --> 09:09.989
Aintree.

09:10.009 --> 09:10.349
Aintree.

09:10.629 --> 09:10.870
Aintree.

09:11.350 --> 09:11.751
Aintree.

09:11.811 --> 09:11.991
Aintree.

09:12.051 --> 09:12.251
Aintree.

09:12.551 --> 09:12.772
Aintree.

09:12.792 --> 09:13.212
Aintree.

09:13.292 --> 09:13.472
Aintree.

09:13.512 --> 09:13.953
Aintree.

09:14.514 --> 09:15.354
Aintree.

09:15.374 --> 09:15.535
Aintree.

09:15.675 --> 09:15.975
Aintree.

09:17.297 --> 09:17.997
Aintree.

09:18.017 --> 09:18.458
Aintree.

09:18.478 --> 09:18.778
Aintree.

09:18.798 --> 09:19.219
Aintree.

09:19.239 --> 09:19.479
Aintree.

09:19.539 --> 09:20.019
Aintree.

09:20.040 --> 09:20.520
Aintree.

09:20.540 --> 09:20.760
Aintree.

09:20.780 --> 09:20.940
Aintree.

09:21.281 --> 09:21.481
Aintree.

09:21.501 --> 09:21.661
Aintree.

09:21.681 --> 09:21.841
Aintree.

09:22.022 --> 09:22.242
Aintree.

09:22.262 --> 09:22.622
Aintree.

09:22.662 --> 09:22.903
Aintree.

09:22.923 --> 09:23.083
Aintree.

09:23.443 --> 09:24.384
Aintree.

09:24.524 --> 09:24.905
Aintree.

09:24.925 --> 09:25.265
Aintree.

09:25.646 --> 09:25.826
Aintree.

09:25.846 --> 09:26.006
Aintree.

09:26.026 --> 09:26.246
Aintree.

09:26.266 --> 09:26.446
Aintree.

09:26.466 --> 09:26.627
Aintree.

09:26.647 --> 09:26.807
Aintree.

09:26.827 --> 09:26.967
Aintree

09:27.233 --> 09:36.844
Well, when I first rode a fancied one for the Queen Mother, the trainer told me, he said, I think you'll win this stick.

09:36.904 --> 09:46.055
He said, jump the last up sides with the others and make a better way home to the finishing post.

09:46.455 --> 09:51.121
Well, I did this, and about halfway up the straight, I thought I was winning quite easily.

09:51.601 --> 09:55.806
I could hear noises shouting, which you don't hear, do you see?

09:56.242 --> 09:58.144
And I thought, my God, I'm being tackled.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.465
So I sat down and rode.

09:59.545 --> 10:00.546
I didn't look around.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.488
It's a bad thing to look.

10:02.508 --> 10:06.993
So I got past the winning post in front, and then I stood up and looked around.

10:07.013 --> 10:10.376
There was nothing within spitting distance of me.

10:10.776 --> 10:16.062
It was one of Her Majesty's early winners, and he was given a great reception.

10:16.662 --> 10:20.026
And this happened a number of times over the next two or three years.

10:20.066 --> 10:22.468
I got used to it.

10:22.685 --> 10:32.037
But this day in the Grand Nationals, she'd never had a runner in the National before, and there hadn't been a runner, a royal runner in the National since about 1900.

10:32.177 --> 10:42.931
And as I jumped the last fence, just in front of the eventual winner, I could hear this crescendo of cheering building up.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.477
Then I just sat down and rode to the winning post.

10:47.626 --> 10:56.637
And 25 yards before you get to the winning post, you gallop past the water jump, which you jump on the first circuit.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.641
The second circuit, you gallop past it to the winning post.

11:00.622 --> 11:10.515
And I've looked at the film, newsreel film, time and time again, and you see Devon Locke sort of pricking his ears just as he's approaching this water jump.

11:10.535 --> 11:12.918
And as he pricks his ears, the noise hits him.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.620
Christ, what's happening?

11:14.640 --> 11:14.880
Sure.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.502
Time quarters refuse to act.

11:17.545 --> 11:23.711
He went down, slid along on his belly, brought his four feet up to stop him going over, slid along on his belly.

11:24.231 --> 11:28.175
How I didn't fall off him, I don't know, but he got to his feet again.

11:28.215 --> 11:33.419
If I could have got him going then, I was still far enough in front to have won.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.441
So he didn't have to be destroyed or anything?

11:35.461 --> 11:36.202
Oh, no, no, no.

11:36.342 --> 11:37.383
He was quite all right.

11:37.944 --> 11:41.907
He pulled all the muscles in his hindquarters, but I couldn't get him going again.

11:41.927 --> 11:44.970
I just had to get off and walk away with a lad.

11:45.406 --> 11:47.608
How far were you from the finish line?

11:47.729 --> 11:49.130
I was about 25 yards.

11:49.150 --> 11:50.071
From the finish line?

11:50.131 --> 11:51.293
From the finish line.

11:51.413 --> 11:53.275
Has the Queen Mother ever won a Grand National?

11:53.295 --> 11:53.475
No.

11:53.895 --> 11:55.277
So that was probably your best shot.

11:55.778 --> 11:57.820
Yes, that was the best shot.

11:57.840 --> 12:07.110
But she and the Queen and Princess Margaret were all there, and I had to go and see them afterwards, and they were as dumbfounded as I was.

12:07.130 --> 12:07.791
What do you say?

12:07.811 --> 12:10.654
I mean, were they sporting about it at least?

12:11.107 --> 12:16.314
I told them what I thought and what a great ride I'd had until this spot.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.316
The Queen Mother was very philosophical.

12:18.817 --> 12:22.261
She said, well, that's racing, isn't it?

12:22.281 --> 12:25.946
So did this in any way influence your becoming in the game?

12:27.948 --> 12:31.613
Well, the horse, he didn't run for six months following that.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.455
He won his next race.

12:33.475 --> 12:34.757
He won two more races.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.158
Really?

12:35.398 --> 12:37.080
He won two more races for me.

12:37.499 --> 12:49.331
And then he, I was laid up in the beginning of 1957 and he ran in a race and his tendon went with another jockey and he was retired from that time on.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.740
And he lived, he lived for another

12:53.665 --> 12:55.007
five years.

12:55.248 --> 12:57.110
Was he a pretty good stud for us?

12:57.731 --> 12:59.935
No, he was no good stud because he was a gelding.

13:02.719 --> 13:04.482
Most steeplechasers are gelding.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.607
Not all of them, but most steeplechasers are gelding.

13:08.769 --> 13:15.780
And tires, stallions, they don't prove to be good steeplechasers.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.281
They hate

13:16.750 --> 13:21.276
jumping over a fence and dragging their private parts over the fence.

13:21.296 --> 13:27.845
But that's why there are very few pool sleepers areas.

13:27.865 --> 13:37.678
And about three months after this episode, my author's agent, John Johnson, he got an introduction to me.

13:38.699 --> 13:40.061
His mother knew my mother.

13:40.822 --> 13:43.045
He said, why didn't I write my autobiography?

13:43.430 --> 13:46.715
You were about thirty-four at this time, I guess.

13:46.895 --> 13:48.097
Well, I was thirty-six.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.178
Thirty-six.

13:49.359 --> 13:53.324
It was old for a secret church job, because that's about the time when I do give up.

13:53.645 --> 13:58.913
Anyhow, I didn't think I could, but he said, go on, you try it.

13:58.973 --> 14:02.298
And my wife said, go on, you're always writing long letters to people.

14:02.598 --> 14:05.482
I'll help with the spelling and English.

14:05.502 --> 14:12.913
So I sat down and wrote The Sport of Kings, my autobiography.

14:13.332 --> 14:18.138
And I'd done about half of it by January 1957.

14:20.802 --> 14:25.347
And I had a nasty fall then, and it was sort of my final fall.

14:25.388 --> 14:26.729
I was very well advised.

14:27.991 --> 14:38.484
I was leading the jockey's table, and my advisor said, if you're going to get out, now's the time until you're at the top of the tree and get all sorts of things off of you.

14:38.504 --> 14:41.528
Well, I got out, and it was news.

14:41.729 --> 14:42.850
All the media wanted...

14:43.285 --> 15:10.339
wanted interviews was i going to trade yeah i was champion jockey you see and it was news and uh i said all right half written my autobiography i'll see what develops well the sports editor of the london sunday express he must have read these reports to the telephone and asked would i lunch with him one day so i had lunch in london and he said uh

15:11.787 --> 15:14.752
It seems you can write a little bit.

15:14.772 --> 15:20.460
Will you write half a dozen articles for my newspaper on the current racing scene?

15:20.480 --> 15:25.689
Well, I'd done three, and they wanted me to become a full-time newspaper man.

15:26.149 --> 15:32.479
I wouldn't become a full-time, I didn't think I was, until the following November, November 1957.

15:32.746 --> 15:34.649
I signed on the dotted line then.

15:35.109 --> 15:37.573
I did it for 16 years.

15:37.693 --> 15:39.476
I missed people after 16 years.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.497
That's amazing.

15:41.098 --> 15:43.902
And it was a good job, and it kept me in the racing world.

15:43.983 --> 15:46.346
It brings you up to your 50s then.

15:46.867 --> 15:55.379
Well, yes, but after about four years, my wife said to me, she said, you always said you're going to write a novel.

15:55.459 --> 15:56.701
She said, now's the time.

15:57.523 --> 16:01.268
The car's beginning to knock, and we've got two sons to educate.

16:01.940 --> 16:13.180
The carpets were wearing out, so I sat down late 1960s, 61, and wrote my first novel, Dead Sirt.

16:14.141 --> 16:18.810
And Michael Joseph, who had published The Sport of Queens, they'd done it very well.

16:20.913 --> 16:25.922
One of the conditions of publication was if I wrote anything else, they must have first refusal.

16:27.100 --> 16:34.148
So my agent took the manuscript of Dead Surfer and Long Film, and they said they'd publish it straight away.

16:34.869 --> 16:41.756
And they published it in the spring of 1962, and there's been one every year ever since.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.160
So you were out there with Ian Fleming at the same time, I guess, right?

16:45.240 --> 16:47.222
Yes, yes.

16:48.183 --> 16:53.890
I hadn't got a James Bond, but I had a different character at the time.

16:53.910 --> 16:55.251
I didn't know...

16:55.501 --> 16:58.886
I knew his brother and sister very well.

17:00.608 --> 17:02.130
We used to spend a lot of time together.

17:02.831 --> 17:04.914
So it's been a pretty good ride for you, hasn't it?

17:04.934 --> 17:05.895
Oh, it hasn't been bad.

17:07.758 --> 17:11.062
It's not nearly so thrilling as riding racing.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.165
That is terrific.

17:14.266 --> 17:18.893
You win a race and people pat you on your back and say, well done, Dick.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.496
Immediate satisfaction is terrific.

17:21.516 --> 17:25.221
But the long-lasting satisfaction comes from the books because...

17:25.775 --> 17:35.007
When you win this race, half an hour after, you go out and you go end over end, and all your patting on the back is gone.

17:35.047 --> 17:38.351
But people read the books the years afterwards.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.435
Does it surprise you, your success?

17:41.456 --> 17:42.597
It does, very much.

17:42.657 --> 17:43.418
Every time, right?

17:43.558 --> 17:44.099
Every time.

17:46.122 --> 17:52.830
I try nowadays, for some years now, I try to improve with everyone.

17:52.850 --> 17:54.853
I try to make them a little better time.

17:55.171 --> 17:56.433
Do you go back and read them at all?

17:56.753 --> 18:06.706
When I'm thinking of a story or thinking of passages of a story, have I used that in such and such a book?

18:06.726 --> 18:08.348
I will go back and read bits of them.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.712
I don't say I'm going to read them all.

18:12.373 --> 18:14.115
But you want to make sure you're not repeating yourself.

18:14.135 --> 18:14.556
Yes.

18:14.576 --> 18:15.577
And how about your fans?

18:15.597 --> 18:17.720
Have your fans ever catch you on things?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.223
No, I'm glad to say they haven't.

18:20.243 --> 18:21.424
Do you hear from horsemen?

18:21.465 --> 18:25.009
I hear from hundreds of people.

18:25.664 --> 18:30.850
And I have a set letter which I write.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.651
It has to be done.

18:32.852 --> 18:41.321
But I hear from children who are 12 and 13 and people who are 90 in every walk of life.

18:42.042 --> 18:42.802
It's amazing.

18:42.862 --> 18:48.649
And it's lovely to hear from the children because I encourage them to read more.

18:48.829 --> 18:52.933
And if you get them at that age, you've got them for life.

18:53.374 --> 18:55.536
Do you think course racing is...

18:55.820 --> 19:00.147
I mean, I know it's not as popular today as it used to be, and I don't know what the reason is.

19:00.167 --> 19:03.954
It is as popular in the United Kingdom, yeah.

19:03.974 --> 19:06.678
And there is more racing now.

19:06.698 --> 19:07.920
There's much more racing.

19:08.281 --> 19:16.595
When I was a champion jockey, I won 76 races in one season.

19:16.615 --> 19:16.976
Wow.

19:17.056 --> 19:17.136
Wow.

19:17.285 --> 19:22.375
But the champion jockeys now are winning over 200 races, jumping races.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.021
South race jockeys used to win over 100.

19:25.602 --> 19:29.029
Jordan Richards, he holds the record.

19:29.049 --> 19:34.720
He rode 259 in one season.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.590
The flat race juffies over here win many more than that, too.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.094
The jumper stems.

19:41.194 --> 19:44.219
When I say, over here, where am I?

19:44.239 --> 19:44.780
I'm in America.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.901
I can't remember where I come from.

19:45.921 --> 19:49.747
Of course, here, horse racing is so closely identified as gambling.

19:49.928 --> 19:50.589
Yes.

19:50.729 --> 19:55.336
And so there are so many other interests now that people are gambling on.

19:55.396 --> 19:58.581
I mean, it's a shame in every way the Indians are becoming...

19:58.848 --> 20:00.530
You know, the modern dean of the Arabs.

20:00.890 --> 20:12.500
Well, they're including that big national lotteries in Britain, and it hasn't started yet, but I think the racing people are wondering what is going to happen.

20:12.781 --> 20:21.449
But lots of people, including myself, go to big race meetings, and I never look at the gambling and never worry about it at all.

20:21.489 --> 20:26.273
I like to see the action and see what the modern-day jockeys are riding like.

20:26.793 --> 20:30.755
I know you've got a signing at 1230.

20:30.895 --> 20:31.639
Yes, I have.

20:31.659 --> 20:33.630
Listen, would you sign it for when?
