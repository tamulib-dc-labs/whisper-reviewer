WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:19.744
We work together on our newspaper articles, and she reads everything that I write critically and as an editor, and she gets me furious sometimes because she's a part of the creative process, but it's very good.

00:20.078 --> 00:23.824
I really don't want to oppose too heavily on Dr. Bettman's time.

00:23.944 --> 00:28.911
No, we'd want to go out and have a little bite if you can make it.

00:29.252 --> 00:46.137
But I would just, if you could just talk briefly about Bach, just a little bit about, to distinguish between how your interest in the photography... Bach is an absolute overman, and it's simply my conviction that we are set on earth...

00:46.572 --> 01:15.432
simply to make a little aura of chaos everything is fairly chaotic chaotic chaotic yes he starts with a theme and develops it and it must always be in the same tonality in the same spirit the theme is carried through

01:15.749 --> 01:26.826
It goes up, up into our forms of variations, but it always comes back that star.

01:27.507 --> 01:29.950
Bach always brings us back to life.

01:30.471 --> 01:31.993
Beethoven doesn't do that.

01:32.494 --> 01:37.562
He starts out and he shoots it up into the subspace.

01:38.303 --> 01:45.013
Bach is confined, small, in his melodic inventions, perhaps.

01:45.365 --> 02:05.796
But when he gets hold of a theme, maybe a chorale or some other form of musical performance, he always, everything is in such wonderful order.

02:06.276 --> 02:07.979
And that's what life is not.

02:09.201 --> 02:12.165
And what did God do when he started the world?

02:13.343 --> 02:16.446
He made Orva out of chaos, didn't he?

02:17.247 --> 02:17.868
Yeah.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.610
Not very successful already.

02:20.190 --> 02:28.619
And I get this wonderful feeling of Orva and everything he writes.

02:29.580 --> 02:36.988
So I can show you a little film how the Batman archive looks today, or will you go there?

02:37.812 --> 02:39.855
It's in New York, isn't it?

02:40.175 --> 02:42.038
Yes, we can go there.

02:42.238 --> 02:44.521
Yeah, you should really see it.

02:44.561 --> 02:47.325
Who should I see?

02:47.506 --> 02:54.055
Mr. What's his name?

02:54.175 --> 02:59.402
He's the son-in-law of Mr. Krauss.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.628
That's in New York, right?

03:03.648 --> 03:05.811
Mr. Herb Gestalver.

03:06.466 --> 03:10.009
G-E-S-T-E-A-L-D-E-R.

03:11.351 --> 03:15.314
I'll be in New York next week, all week.

03:15.615 --> 03:17.797
I've got a couple of free days.

03:17.837 --> 03:19.618
Maybe I can do that.

03:19.819 --> 03:22.061
I don't know what's happening there.

03:23.142 --> 03:33.311
I have a little film about it that a German did, but I don't think it's overly interesting.

03:33.371 --> 03:34.212
It's just...

03:34.580 --> 04:03.169
peculiar that this little cigar box that I started, also greatly inspired by my father, started with medical pictures, which I, as a young boy, simply as a joke, I went to his waste paper basket, and there were all these prospectuses of medical firms and a lot of medical...

04:03.689 --> 04:32.194
medical material in it taintings to dress it up and i i clipped these out and made my own boyish picture history of medicine out of it and this really started me then to seriously collect medical pictures it was one of the successful first successful

04:32.714 --> 04:40.945
aspect of the Bettmann Academy, started with the Pictorial History of Medicine.

04:40.965 --> 04:42.207
I think you have seen it.

04:43.609 --> 04:43.929
I have.

04:44.009 --> 04:46.333
And you did this before you came to the United States.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.035
This is why you were still here.

04:48.095 --> 04:49.777
No, I did it here.

04:50.398 --> 04:51.139
Oh, okay.

04:51.560 --> 05:00.612
You know, often you struggle so much for acceptances when in other books you

05:00.997 --> 05:04.321
You just hit it right one time.

05:04.782 --> 05:10.008
I think it was one of the first ventures medical publishers not into.

05:10.589 --> 05:13.753
It's no, I've read Knopf or Henry Old.

05:15.014 --> 05:19.800
But he said, yeah, I want to do that.

05:19.920 --> 05:26.228
And I don't give advances, but I have found that if you give advances,

05:26.512 --> 05:27.754
You'll never get a book.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.580
Briefly, because I think it's very important.

05:33.021 --> 05:34.503
Did you have a hard time?

05:35.244 --> 05:36.385
Selling this book?

05:37.887 --> 05:38.147
Yes.

05:39.449 --> 05:43.535
You did pedal it around a bit?

05:43.635 --> 05:52.126
It had been under contract to Random House at one point, and that editor left and went to another house, and I became an orphan.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.409
And then they didn't want the book.

05:54.575 --> 05:57.801
Well, that very often happens.

05:57.861 --> 06:04.073
They canceled the contract, and I got to sell it all over again, which I didn't know.

06:04.093 --> 06:07.379
Oh, this is really highly regarded.

06:07.479 --> 06:09.242
This is very fine.

06:09.593 --> 06:15.580
One of the few really great houses that hasn't been absorbed by others.

06:15.660 --> 06:22.848
They've maintained their identity, and they still want to do good books, and to do them well, and I couldn't be happier with them.

06:22.868 --> 06:27.133
They're really textbook publishers, actually, mostly.

06:27.553 --> 06:32.539
What my editor said, the young man who bought this book, he said, I don't care if it sells 3,000 copies.

06:32.619 --> 06:37.845
He said, it's a book that deserves to be published and to be published well, and for that,

06:37.943 --> 06:41.268
They have my undying loyalty, really.

06:42.149 --> 06:44.132
They want to do another one.

06:45.334 --> 06:47.818
There must be a market for friends.

06:50.141 --> 06:52.124
We were lucky.

06:52.765 --> 06:53.446
We were lucky.

06:53.727 --> 06:58.414
We were lucky that Random House didn't want, because look at the beautiful job.

06:58.434 --> 07:03.281
You were ambitious and had the right idea, and we went this way.

07:04.002 --> 07:05.444
How long did it take you?

07:06.125 --> 07:06.786
Eight years?

07:07.036 --> 07:16.453
I did 250 interviews like this, and of people who we talked to.

07:16.574 --> 07:22.665
I have 250 hours of tape or something, thousands of pages of research.

07:23.135 --> 07:26.403
But I hate to hear myself in my own tapes.

07:26.423 --> 07:31.274
It's a real book, but I'm really, these things are really drunk.

07:31.415 --> 07:37.549
My wife saw the story about you first in the New York Times, and she said, we have to go see this man in Florida.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.242
for the next book.

07:39.302 --> 07:43.027
And when I read it, I said, my God, this is unbelievable.

07:43.047 --> 07:46.352
Yeah, but I haven't been given you very much.

07:46.372 --> 07:47.173
Actually, you have.

07:48.274 --> 07:50.377
This is a dream.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.959
This is the way I like to do interviews.

07:52.019 --> 07:58.268
I really like to have it more of an oral history kind of a thing to allow you to talk about the things that you do.

07:58.648 --> 08:05.818
I have asked you a few questions, actually, of things that I'm interested in.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.300
And I really, I'm...

08:07.600 --> 08:10.884
conscious of the fact that I don't want to impose too much on your time.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.947
But can I just ask you about these pictures?

08:13.588 --> 08:20.316
Would it be possible at some point in the future to acquire reproductions of those pictures for the next book?

08:20.336 --> 08:29.067
Yeah, of course I'm a pauper now when it comes to the procession of pictures for all of the Batman archives.

08:29.548 --> 08:34.134
These are pictures specifically from your history of the book section, I think.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.616
Yeah, that's right.

08:35.636 --> 08:37.438
I looked into this

08:37.975 --> 08:40.959
what we call the Bedman Paul.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.462
Okay, that's fine, the dog.

08:42.982 --> 08:43.283
Yeah.

08:43.803 --> 08:56.542
And, for instance, reading was always my great passion and the first group of pictures that I assembled.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.269
Those are wonderful.

09:01.409 --> 09:02.451
Yeah, it's the Bedman Paul.

09:02.471 --> 09:02.751
Great kind of.

09:03.153 --> 09:07.839
This is, of course, totally overhauled now, overhauled.

09:07.859 --> 09:12.245
I'm sorry, you mentioned earlier about collecting books for their illustrations, is that right?

09:13.126 --> 09:16.110
Did you actually collect books for their illustrations?

09:16.130 --> 09:18.392
No, rather the other way around.

09:18.573 --> 09:22.738
Once I had the picture, I thought we must put this in the book.

09:22.758 --> 09:26.723
But today this will always be on the computer.

09:28.005 --> 09:32.991
I want something on the printing.

09:34.996 --> 09:38.320
This was rather a nice venture.

09:38.340 --> 09:45.309
For not only did people have to call me up and ask for a picture.

09:45.329 --> 09:49.715
Oh, they're all over here.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.357
Here they are, sure.

09:51.377 --> 09:53.220
Yeah.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.003
Oh, so this was kind of like a... A catalog.

09:56.023 --> 09:57.706
A catalog that people could go in.

09:57.946 --> 10:00.609
This was a catalog that they could go in and make a selection.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.233
I mean, it was a double pincer.

10:03.253 --> 10:04.935
We sold this thing for...

10:05.337 --> 10:22.361
for twenty-five dollars, and then the people simply told us, even a photographer in Central Park or a woman in the middle of the Kodak, so they called us up, sent me twenty-eight, twenty-seven.

10:23.062 --> 10:26.527
But that's now computerized.

10:27.889 --> 10:28.950
It isn't, that's something.

10:29.431 --> 10:29.691
Yeah.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.475
And that's there for you.

10:32.658 --> 10:35.961
Yeah, but you used the same picture that we did in a couple of two.

10:36.482 --> 10:44.449
Yeah, I used the same picture in front of you, like that, so I don't want to.

10:44.469 --> 10:48.874
I really could have saved you a lot of trouble.

10:49.214 --> 10:51.717
I'm going to put that in the prologue, you know that?

10:52.157 --> 10:54.479
I'm going to put that in the prologue of the next part.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.083
I mean, all these pictures will come on.

10:58.423 --> 10:59.684
I have no idea the letters.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.547
I sent all over the world to get to you.

11:03.235 --> 11:04.477
chased all around.

11:04.497 --> 11:20.809
They had, you know, paper, and they had some sort of paper that was waterproof so that people could read in the bathroom.

11:24.817 --> 11:25.598
That's wonderful.

11:25.915 --> 11:27.256
I've got no way.

11:27.437 --> 11:27.977
I've got no way.

11:28.037 --> 11:30.800
I'm actually going to shut this up.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.162
I don't want to impose any further.

11:33.362 --> 11:36.606
I wonder if it was kind of inscribed to those books that you gave to us, though.

11:36.646 --> 11:39.168
I would be— No, I would be very fair of them.

11:39.188 --> 11:48.037
We would be honored to add them to our— Sometimes when you inscribe a book, it's harder than you write it, isn't it?

11:48.057 --> 11:49.638
I've taken a few pictures, by the way.

11:49.658 --> 11:50.459
I hope you don't mind.

11:50.479 --> 11:53.222
No, that's very kind, but I don't know.

11:54.232 --> 11:59.957
My nose is powerful.

12:00.858 --> 12:01.419
It's the same.

12:01.739 --> 12:03.000
The same in sheets in the back.

12:06.003 --> 12:08.445
That's the Levenger.

12:09.126 --> 12:11.528
This is the reproduction of his neck.

12:11.568 --> 12:14.231
Does it say that?

12:14.251 --> 12:16.012
Oh, my God.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.974
That's correct, yes.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.576
Yeah.

12:19.596 --> 12:22.078
That's the Durer engraving on the front.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.941
Yeah, certainly.

12:23.961 --> 12:26.164
In fact, the original one is right here.

12:28.426 --> 12:30.188
I'll show you the lip there.

12:30.208 --> 12:30.528
Find it.

12:31.529 --> 12:33.952
First, the first signature photographs.

12:33.992 --> 12:34.392
Here it is.

12:35.673 --> 12:39.177
Can you find his book too?

12:39.197 --> 12:40.138
Yes.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.080
And you have all the peeps.

12:42.100 --> 12:42.420
Yeah, right.

12:44.743 --> 12:50.749
That's the actual, that's, he was the first fool of the whole Navy, but that's the Dasnan Shif.

12:51.387 --> 13:04.461
There are a lot of pictures in there, there.

13:04.481 --> 13:04.781
Probably.

13:04.801 --> 13:05.262
Yeah.

13:05.282 --> 13:15.292
That's on the guy's phone, I'm going to go.

13:15.312 --> 13:16.213
Yeah, I'm going to go.

13:20.142 --> 13:25.167
Unfortunately, it was translated by Boogang.

13:25.267 --> 13:26.429
Did you ever come across it?

13:26.749 --> 13:27.550
No, it's not in there.

13:28.191 --> 13:29.132
I don't know that, no.

13:29.172 --> 13:29.572
Yeah.

13:30.293 --> 13:31.935
I've got to end this thing.

13:35.078 --> 13:36.039
It's marvelous.

13:36.059 --> 13:46.009
It's so well-written, enviously well-written, and yet has the basis of scholarship.

13:46.029 --> 13:47.431
That's awesome.

13:47.531 --> 13:49.053
It's talking about my book.

13:49.073 --> 13:49.373
It's amazing.

13:49.808 --> 13:52.653
I have a catalog.

13:52.673 --> 13:54.155
I don't know if we have this one.

13:54.315 --> 14:07.277
It's books that rarely are recognized, and I'm rather happy that you are on this list of distinguished books for

14:07.831 --> 14:13.399
Well, you are going to be a prominent figure in our next book, which we hope to have allowed in three years.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.504
We'll finish it in two, and we'll see it published in 1999.

14:16.744 --> 14:20.690
Yeah, I hope I still have allowed.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.293
Time is getting it shown.

14:22.473 --> 14:23.675
You'll get the first copy.

14:25.758 --> 14:30.625
And now engage, I just don't want to keep you too long.

14:30.645 --> 14:32.708
I'm getting very nice looking at.

14:33.346 --> 14:37.671
I'm just going to ask you to inscribe these books for us before we forget.

14:37.691 --> 14:40.415
These are treasures for us.

14:42.578 --> 14:46.262
You're collecting these now.

14:46.543 --> 14:46.783
Yeah.

14:47.263 --> 14:58.057
It's simply I'm taking old paintings, great paintings, not as pathetic achievements, but that they tell us about the life of women.

14:58.978 --> 15:02.863
Motherhood, you know, and

15:03.822 --> 15:10.611
And for what purpose are you collecting these now, Dan?

15:10.631 --> 15:11.111
Yeah.

15:12.613 --> 15:13.755
Just like a book?

15:13.775 --> 15:14.596
Is this another book?

15:14.616 --> 15:15.617
What they're doing, yeah.

15:16.398 --> 15:23.007
They could be a book of this, but these are terribly expensive.

15:23.387 --> 15:25.129
So you're still working as a writer?

15:25.169 --> 15:27.973
You're not slowing down at all, are you?

15:31.750 --> 15:32.852
He calls it holy.

15:33.973 --> 15:39.400
Yeah, coming into the open.

15:39.941 --> 15:48.473
Women only painted sideways and then slowly showing their face and starting to, committed to love.

15:50.355 --> 15:51.557
Beautiful.

15:51.577 --> 15:54.501
You know, one thing we haven't said, and I think we should, is that

15:54.835 --> 16:07.046
You mentioned to me that the royalties from this book you have donated to the Library of Congress, which I think is really quite a remarkable gesture in your part.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.169
Well, I don't know.

16:10.530 --> 16:20.039
I just gave a talk at the Smithsonian a few weeks ago about my adventures.

16:20.539 --> 16:20.940
The Smithsonian?

16:21.080 --> 16:21.940
And in Washington?

16:22.521 --> 16:24.623
Yeah.

16:26.965 --> 16:40.759
I was there two weeks ago at the Library of Congress.

16:41.220 --> 16:45.665
I was there after the Smithsonian, I'm sorry, the Smithsonian.

16:45.785 --> 16:55.555
And I did the New York Public Library and the Grower Club and Harvard College a couple weeks ago, and the Roxburgh Club.

16:56.075 --> 16:58.278
That's part of it.

16:58.779 --> 17:01.803
That's part of it.

17:01.923 --> 17:09.454
They call you a modern renaissance man, who has mastered the art of reinventing himself.

17:10.235 --> 17:11.537
How do you respond to that?

17:12.198 --> 17:12.999
I don't know how.

17:13.039 --> 17:25.457
I think that—and see, acquiring all these rights to these famous pictures, there's Truman holding the Dewey Beats Truman, the famous Marilyn Monroe

17:25.690 --> 17:27.773
How did you acquire the rights?

17:27.793 --> 17:33.283
These are already in the new era.

17:33.363 --> 17:37.449
These are already pictures in the new Batman archive.

17:37.469 --> 17:40.294
They come from the United Press.

17:40.354 --> 17:41.897
Oh, they came from UTI.

17:41.917 --> 17:42.758
Yeah.

17:42.778 --> 17:43.159
I see.

17:43.760 --> 17:49.369
And I think they made it a little bit too modern, but I have no credit for this.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.714
Well, it's 12 o'clock, and I really don't want to pose too heavily on you.

17:54.794 --> 17:57.337
No, I'm delighted, but I don't want to take too much.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.481
But I said, oh, therefore, click by.

18:00.641 --> 18:03.284
Okay, could you inscribe these for us before we go on?

18:03.345 --> 18:09.372
Maybe I should think of something smart, and then we'll see you.

18:09.793 --> 18:11.835
Okay, that would be wonderful.

18:12.035 --> 18:13.597
Yeah, that would be wonderful.

18:14.038 --> 18:16.161
I expect a new shipment of these.

18:17.082 --> 18:18.023
We have a...

18:18.830 --> 18:22.854
Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like to take them with me, because I'd like to read them.

18:23.955 --> 18:26.878
I would, yeah.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.263
Well, we have a lot of the time in the world, but we don't want to impose on your time.

18:31.363 --> 18:34.306
We don't want to impose on your time.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.067
We have—we're here.

18:35.087 --> 18:37.289
I'll put this aside, so it'll affect them.

18:37.329 --> 18:41.834
I'll help you put these books away, actually.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.837
My poison is at three or four.

18:46.302 --> 18:49.044
You had your doctorate in history.

18:49.945 --> 18:52.868
Did you want to be a teacher?

18:53.188 --> 18:55.070
Was teaching something that you aspired to?

18:55.110 --> 19:01.496
No, I wanted to be more of a publisher.

19:01.876 --> 19:08.602
As a matter of fact, my dissertation was on the book trade.

19:10.744 --> 19:16.309
Every time he says something, I can't thank you enough for these books.

19:16.593 --> 19:23.363
Well, it is nothing compared to your enormous achievement.

19:23.383 --> 19:27.388
Well, I'm just so pleased that you're going to be part of the next book that we're doing.

19:27.589 --> 19:33.497
Well, at the same time.

19:33.517 --> 19:34.819
What is the occasion you were saying?

19:35.039 --> 19:36.081
Of the book trade.

19:36.101 --> 19:37.302
Of the German book trade?

19:37.362 --> 19:38.204
Of the European?

19:38.304 --> 19:43.111
Of the German.

19:44.613 --> 19:46.195
That's okay.

19:46.512 --> 19:55.204
Could you tell us just a little bit about it without—do you remember the title of it?

19:55.805 --> 20:00.371
Yes, it's an impossible title.

20:00.832 --> 20:07.822
The Development of Ideals in the Book Trade.

20:07.942 --> 20:11.727
Development of Ideals in the Book Trade in Germany.

20:13.445 --> 20:19.714
And I was really trying to decide to get into publishing.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.278
So you wanted to be a publisher?

20:22.999 --> 20:23.359
Yes.

20:23.379 --> 20:26.043
As an editor, too, or mainly a publisher of books?

20:26.063 --> 20:34.315
Well, you start as an editor, and you hope you can produce your books and sell.

20:35.437 --> 20:39.663
I can find this at the Library of Congress, Dr. So you really don't have to look for it.

20:39.683 --> 20:40.684
I'm sure they'll have it there.

20:42.402 --> 20:48.011
I'm sure Harvard will have it.

20:55.443 --> 20:57.226
I'll find it.

20:57.346 --> 21:04.798
Not to worry.

21:05.690 --> 21:19.328
I'm getting a little stiff, really.

21:37.685 --> 22:01.857
.

22:01.877 --> 22:01.897
.

22:01.917 --> 22:01.937
.

22:10.237 --> 22:23.008
I'm losing my touch.

22:23.069 --> 22:25.251
What was the piece that you just played?

22:25.931 --> 22:27.092
What was that piece?

22:27.112 --> 22:34.038
It was a manuette from one of the piano suites.

22:34.058 --> 22:39.163
And then I played with a friend on two pianos, you know, Bach, Roger,

22:39.683 --> 22:44.529
all sorts of, even a concert for four pianos.

22:44.789 --> 22:45.230
Wow.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.993
We had so many children, they all played with them.

22:48.794 --> 22:53.220
They're gorgeous, gorgeous, wonderful things.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.562
That's wonderful.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.285
I can't give them all too little time to it.

22:57.986 --> 23:00.229
I thought I would have a little time.

23:00.269 --> 23:02.411
You don't have a lifetime, apparently.

23:02.431 --> 23:03.853
You've been very busy.

23:04.374 --> 23:06.096
I probably call this retirement.

23:08.725 --> 23:21.837
You have the works of Emerson, and Francis Parkman.

23:22.778 --> 23:23.959
Oh, I wonder if these are firsts.

23:28.344 --> 23:29.084
Those are wonderful.

23:31.447 --> 23:33.649
Well, Francis Parkman.

23:33.669 --> 23:38.293
See, you have the American historians here, Parkman, Prescott.

23:39.134 --> 23:44.059
And Emerson, now it's very interesting that you have so much American literature here.

23:44.379 --> 24:04.198
Yeah, well, I had a coffee with my wife, but when I bought these, I must admit, mainly for buying things, it seems to be the case for.

24:04.218 --> 24:08.162
They bought them Russia in some

24:08.682 --> 24:09.805
Very early.

24:11.609 --> 24:16.460
There's a finished part, you know, the steam part.

24:16.540 --> 24:21.472
That's right.

24:21.492 --> 24:23.637
That's very nice.

24:25.810 --> 24:26.912
I must go.

24:26.952 --> 24:45.422
...the German bookcase, they have so much trouble with Lieblings, illegal Lieblings, how the German bookcase by some sort of unwritten...

24:45.402 --> 24:56.374
the information that restrained me from illegal weapons.

24:56.394 --> 25:15.274
And it was always a very remarkable bunch of German publishers, a very direct crime of human beings in professional, ethical, behavioral, fine sense of beauty,

25:15.254 --> 25:27.948
We thought the Germans would in the French and the English.

25:28.388 --> 25:36.497
And we are working on it.

25:36.517 --> 25:43.084
My agent is working on it too.

25:43.064 --> 25:46.870
We'll see what happens.

25:46.890 --> 25:48.513
It's really a phenomenon.

25:48.533 --> 25:52.819
Of course, most of the focus of part two is North America.

25:53.661 --> 25:56.125
That kind of limits interest in part two.

25:57.126 --> 26:00.852
Part two of the book is largely North America.

26:00.872 --> 26:05.179
Part one is more individual.

26:05.199 --> 26:05.399
We'll see.

26:05.419 --> 26:07.823
I'm not worried about it.

26:07.843 --> 26:08.224
It'll be out there.

26:08.244 --> 26:08.464
Absolutely.

26:08.967 --> 26:19.343
Well, I have to tell you something.

26:19.403 --> 26:30.580
I grew up reading the New York Times and always wanted to be a writer and a journalist.

26:30.680 --> 26:37.050
And I cannot tell you how I always remember seeing photo credits for Bettman Archives.

26:37.216 --> 26:39.560
I've seen it thousands of times.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.705
I've been sitting here with the man who created it.

26:42.805 --> 26:45.229
It's really quite a place to be.

26:45.349 --> 26:46.912
I mean, I study journalism.

26:47.112 --> 26:49.215
It's just a crazy idea.

26:49.235 --> 26:52.160
I never thought it would go in America.

26:52.961 --> 26:58.911
But we are a picture mind that's really very intensely.

26:58.931 --> 26:59.612
I think it's

27:00.065 --> 27:06.876
German Kultur in quotation marks is a little more verbal.

27:07.357 --> 27:21.820
From the early times, the whole invention of photography points to the need to see things rather than to recreate them verbally.

27:22.103 --> 27:28.154
And also the fastness of pick-up, isn't it?

27:28.174 --> 27:39.414
I mean, you see a picture of this famous Chinese saying.

27:40.015 --> 27:43.842
I once gave a course here in

27:44.294 --> 27:49.420
in pictorial research at the university.

27:49.941 --> 27:58.811
The first thing they always throw at you was, one picture is worth a thousand pounds.

27:58.831 --> 27:59.853
Do you agree with that?

28:00.153 --> 28:00.513
No.

28:00.553 --> 28:05.519
I think a world can be sometimes worth a thousand pictures.

28:05.539 --> 28:07.562
That's wonderful.

28:07.722 --> 28:13.189
Well, for Otto Beckmann to say that, I'm stunned.

28:13.209 --> 28:13.609
Yes.

28:13.589 --> 28:18.695
Norman Cousins made a statement about it.

28:18.815 --> 28:29.428
He said that words have a way of wrapping thought up in three dimensions.

28:29.448 --> 28:39.360
And pictures, you see them, they flutter by and they have no great impact in your thinking.

28:39.813 --> 29:07.479
It was a strange thing that this one picture, the burning of the Hindenburg, that is a great feature now of the new Batman Archive, what happened, the activity, not the thinking, not the... So anyway, the next time I came to the classroom, they didn't agree with that at all.

29:07.499 --> 29:09.060
The picture is a thing.

29:09.209 --> 29:16.619
He had a big sign up, one picture is worth a thousand bucks.

29:17.179 --> 29:20.964
That's wonderful.

29:21.004 --> 29:22.506
That's wonderful.

29:22.907 --> 29:32.219
Are you familiar with this phrase, interactive books now, where the, it's a computer phrase.

29:32.419 --> 29:33.360
Yeah.

29:33.644 --> 29:38.490
A person on the computer can interact with the text and do things.

29:38.510 --> 29:38.871
Oh, really?

29:38.991 --> 29:40.353
No, I didn't know that.

29:40.373 --> 29:48.063
And, of course, they say, now, the first interactive books were probably books with pictures, where you interacted with pictures, or pop-up books, or movable books.

29:48.083 --> 29:48.303
Yeah.

29:49.204 --> 29:54.471
Well, it gives you the semblance of a new dimension of depth.

29:55.278 --> 29:59.783
I don't know how much... But the book is still the text, though, I think.

30:00.865 --> 30:11.377
Well, it's an expansion of thinking and of getting a better grasp of life.

30:11.397 --> 30:18.425
But I still think the true living set life are better than books.

30:19.326 --> 30:24.272
And computers just give you very much the surface.

30:24.522 --> 30:26.285
Do you break chess?

30:26.305 --> 30:27.266
You must break chess.

30:27.446 --> 30:29.409
No, I don't really.

30:29.790 --> 30:35.097
I know that there is a thinker scheme, isn't it?

30:35.117 --> 30:44.691
You think like the principle of chess as an application to the way of living, isn't it?

30:44.671 --> 30:49.338
I'm not a chess player myself, but I am certainly.

30:49.358 --> 30:54.566
I wonder if you read the newspapers where a computer played the world champion chess player.

30:54.666 --> 30:57.530
And I say, my answer to that is, so what?

30:57.991 --> 31:01.476
I mean, this is supposed to be a human expression.

31:01.496 --> 31:03.980
It's like trying to get a computer to compose music.

31:04.581 --> 31:05.843
Cooking is what it sounds like.

31:05.863 --> 31:07.986
It's not a human artistic expression.

31:08.006 --> 31:10.830
It is the expression of a human soul, not a machine.

31:10.810 --> 31:21.293
I think this whole computerized music is for the pearls.

31:21.543 --> 31:27.351
One of the folks.

31:27.371 --> 31:39.709
Do they have about the apprehension and comprehension of life that the computer takes over?

31:40.050 --> 31:50.605
It sounds very old-fashioned and remote.

31:50.585 --> 32:01.455
As I told you, they objected to printing too, but the Master had the five students of the

32:01.621 --> 32:04.245
of the depths of thinking.

32:05.026 --> 32:09.472
It was an auditory culture.

32:10.414 --> 32:14.580
They only had their memory before.

32:15.781 --> 32:17.664
You mentioned auditory.

32:17.824 --> 32:22.751
Did the Bettman archive ever do anything with recordings at all?

32:22.771 --> 32:27.358
Did your archive ever do anything with recordings or was it all visual?

32:27.575 --> 32:45.027
I should have shown you how I cut up the world, almost like a decimal system, a systematized book.

32:45.445 --> 32:54.036
So I developed a book, almost a book, with all the different categories.

32:54.657 --> 33:15.064
M was medicine, and M was anesthesia, or poons, or, and then, naturally very difficult now, the geographical things, 47, France, Germany, Morocco, and so on.

33:15.550 --> 33:23.319
That was one of the merits of the archive, and that has enormously grown.

33:23.880 --> 33:33.391
This new country is popping up every few weeks.

33:33.431 --> 33:35.273
It was kind of a time saver.

33:35.293 --> 33:40.579
People came in and people told me how food is.

33:40.745 --> 33:43.913
Washington on a white horse.

33:44.013 --> 33:46.620
I go to the library and get a food store.

33:47.322 --> 33:51.031
So I said, my good man, how long will it take you?

33:51.933 --> 33:58.129
And here they called up and I looked at the animals.

33:58.362 --> 34:01.206
I have a pedigree in here.

34:01.226 --> 34:02.548
This is Minutes.

34:02.628 --> 34:08.397
We had some pictorial documents.

34:09.037 --> 34:12.042
It was interesting.

34:14.305 --> 34:17.670
The library of Congress collection, of course, of

34:17.650 --> 34:21.315
The photographic art is extraordinary.

34:22.256 --> 34:26.102
They have many, many millions of images, as you know.

34:26.783 --> 34:37.498
And this photo collection at the University of Texas in Austin, the Humanities, which we write about, they have an extraordinary photographic collection in Austin, Texas.

34:37.978 --> 34:43.226
And actually, I'm surprised they didn't try and buy the Bettman archive before Bill Gates did.

34:43.286 --> 34:45.008
That would have...

34:44.988 --> 34:59.419
How many generations does your family go back and lightsaber?

34:59.703 --> 35:02.730
My father was a dude.

35:02.810 --> 35:09.245
He probably came from the Rheinland, from the West.

35:09.886 --> 35:18.927
And then they said, I don't know what was made, it's true in a very small town in Turingia.

35:19.379 --> 35:30.163
In the middle, it's a very beautiful part of the country.

35:30.183 --> 35:33.069
More architecture here.

35:33.089 --> 35:37.118
Thankfully, I humbly started with a little inn.

35:37.334 --> 35:38.916
I think they are always lying.

35:38.956 --> 35:50.770
I think I am sure there is some talent in the one teacher town, you know, there was a thing.

35:50.790 --> 35:54.154
They missed the schoolmaster.

35:54.174 --> 35:59.680
He talked until they were sent to a big city, to a commission.

35:59.980 --> 36:07.028
My father seen me shoot some interest and some lessons.

36:07.108 --> 36:17.521
He really was supported to go to the university by the American and French.

36:17.961 --> 36:20.765
He could never have done it otherwise.

36:20.785 --> 36:28.654
And then he went to Luxburg in Bavaria and

36:29.258 --> 36:36.491
The physicist professor was a man by the name of Holken, Wilhelm Holken.

36:36.591 --> 36:40.097
He was an inventor of the X-rays.

36:40.117 --> 36:44.905
Your father was a professor.

36:44.945 --> 36:51.356
My father became a father who was his assistant for a time.

36:51.457 --> 36:54.642
He was an inventor, that's right.

36:54.925 --> 36:57.247
His father became his assistant.

36:57.267 --> 36:59.950
Your father was making his assistant?

36:59.970 --> 37:13.342
And then there was a very, very, very... The angels, they had no idea that he could be terribly destroyed.

37:13.422 --> 37:18.586
So my father constructed it early in all his life.

37:18.606 --> 37:22.570
He put these terrible wounds that he had to...

37:22.550 --> 37:29.305
I mean, he died for it, finally, when he was 70.

37:29.746 --> 37:35.138
But to see that this turned around, I mean, there we thought it was kind of a joke.

37:35.619 --> 37:40.069
When we had a children's party, we always went downstairs to...

37:40.049 --> 37:50.305
They could show them how much money they had in the... So they used it as a... It was amazing, yeah.

37:50.345 --> 37:57.797
They had said that it's good to come, you know, for the use of it.

37:57.817 --> 37:58.378
Wow.

37:58.438 --> 38:06.090
That's a little idea, there was... the X-rays...

38:06.070 --> 38:26.456
One has to take through a different method of instrumentarium.

38:27.978 --> 38:35.487
So the Father was a researcher as well as a surgeon.

38:35.467 --> 38:40.833
It must have been magical.

38:40.994 --> 38:43.637
It's scary when you think of how dangerous it is.

38:43.717 --> 38:47.341
I didn't understand how dangerous they went to Florida.

38:47.581 --> 38:50.445
It was very sarcastic.

38:50.525 --> 38:55.791
Marie Curie was first working with radium and all that.

38:56.211 --> 38:57.493
That killed her.

38:57.693 --> 39:00.917
I think her husband...

39:01.201 --> 39:07.130
Was this a team of forces?

39:07.270 --> 39:20.509
A team of forces?

39:20.843 --> 39:35.967
The greatest thing ever.

39:35.947 --> 39:39.310
I'll look it up.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.692
Tauchnitz?

39:40.852 --> 39:44.395
Tauchnitz editions.

39:44.656 --> 39:47.719
And they were the first pocketbooks, basically.

39:47.739 --> 39:52.383
They were really the first pocketbooks for the German book trade.

39:52.403 --> 39:56.007
It was very strict in book design.

39:56.027 --> 40:04.736
And he wanted a classical book also in classical form.

40:05.036 --> 40:05.937
So they...

40:06.254 --> 40:10.999
The book of art was very highly developed in Germany.

40:11.580 --> 40:16.485
And this man had simply taught it because in the 1840s.

40:17.486 --> 40:21.049
Then the Germans were great Anglophiles.

40:22.110 --> 40:24.793
My mother spoke English very well.

40:24.993 --> 40:31.300
We had an English nurse, friends, Miss Harris.

40:31.583 --> 40:42.347
I don't know how Enoch came over here.

40:42.427 --> 40:50.284
He found a cichlid here.

40:50.264 --> 41:06.703
And then the others, the grave, the grave, I think what's his name?

41:06.904 --> 41:11.789
And they died up with Simon & Schuster.

41:11.970 --> 41:17.436
What's the prophecy?

41:17.416 --> 41:24.962
It's all part of that thing.

41:25.330 --> 41:50.072
Yes, there was a book published on this about this whole wave of what these people brought to this country in terms of intellect, in terms of industry,

41:50.052 --> 41:55.898
enterprise and how much of a great benefit to this country.

41:55.938 --> 41:58.781
The real great ones, the scientists.

41:58.801 --> 41:59.502
Einstein?

41:59.522 --> 42:03.125
In a way, yes.

42:03.245 --> 42:04.967
There's a book about it.

42:05.608 --> 42:11.574
It's called Chased Out of Paradise.

42:11.674 --> 42:15.157
We just thought we have this book.

42:15.177 --> 42:17.680
I think I have a paragraph in there too.

42:17.660 --> 42:21.026
But very modestly.

42:21.527 --> 42:23.270
Exiled in Paradise.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.574
Exiled in Paradise.

42:25.594 --> 42:28.860
And I just wrote another book.

42:29.421 --> 42:31.545
Why are you interested in this?

42:31.565 --> 42:37.997
You seem to observe the American...

42:38.213 --> 42:41.278
attracts you to this new promise.

42:41.298 --> 42:53.978
I'm interested in the transmission of knowledge, and how knowledge in not just texts, but knowledge migrates, and this wave of thoughts, of linguals,

42:53.958 --> 42:57.726
that came here enriched this country.

42:57.866 --> 43:08.508
I mean, Hitler sent these people here, and we are the great beneficiaries of Hitler, and political fraud, and, well, it's extraordinary.

43:08.708 --> 43:14.380
I want to trace this, not just through books, but through texts.

43:14.360 --> 43:40.890
Well, because we are a conglomeration of different people, our grandparents, people in Greece, my grandparents, my grandparents,

43:40.870 --> 43:46.580
They bring something, but they get something too.

43:46.660 --> 43:52.289
That's wonderful.

43:52.429 --> 44:02.726
Well, you must be far away from an emigre celebration.

44:02.847 --> 44:03.688
I don't speak.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.572
I don't speak Greek, unfortunately.

44:06.652 --> 44:08.903
I only speak English, which is a loss.

44:08.923 --> 44:13.122
I wish I did.

44:13.355 --> 44:17.401
Now, how was your English when you moved here?

44:17.901 --> 44:34.985
My friends who came a year before left at it took me immediately to NYU.

44:35.065 --> 44:36.527
They had started

44:36.507 --> 44:46.022
uh, cause English photographers at NYU to, uh, kind of catch up.

44:46.042 --> 44:48.686
I had no idea they would.

44:48.706 --> 44:54.075
They'd put in this before they came, so that was a major month ago.

44:54.095 --> 44:57.140
A very multi-lingual, actually.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.587
Here's a question for you, where did you keep all the pictures?

45:01.938 --> 45:03.721
How are the images?

45:03.741 --> 45:10.233
Well, they were all a minute or rather than a minute or two.

45:10.253 --> 45:20.892
Of course I started out with one filing cabinet and now they have made it.

45:20.912 --> 45:21.533
It's simple.

45:21.553 --> 45:22.495
Oh, and I...

45:22.475 --> 45:26.922
was famous as a picture for a veil.

45:28.744 --> 45:34.252
The people were always excited about pictures.

45:34.272 --> 45:37.076
And they had some very nice standards.

45:37.457 --> 45:41.383
A picture must have certain qualities.

45:41.403 --> 45:47.031
I got so many offers of pictures.

45:47.011 --> 45:55.922
Mr. Tasman, you must see my grandfather's pictures of Spanish Americans.

45:56.622 --> 46:08.817
And then it was when it stuck so far away that you couldn't see much, but these people all thought they had to take pressures on their hands.

46:08.797 --> 46:20.850
There were certain criteria for a good picture, for signs, for usability, for a needed impact.

46:23.113 --> 46:25.496
Did you judge them all individually?

46:25.556 --> 46:33.364
Well, you said the pictures went trampling over my desk.

46:33.384 --> 46:36.728
I threw too many pictures of it.

46:37.130 --> 46:48.962
My girls came out of this after hours and picked by four of these and wanted to found a new Batman archive.

46:48.982 --> 46:50.244
Is that what threw them away?

46:51.445 --> 46:57.251
Yes, I think we are much too uncritical.

46:57.271 --> 47:03.137
We have learned how to pick the best and certain principles of

47:03.269 --> 47:05.934
picture quality that I have.

47:06.895 --> 47:15.871
I don't know about some strange hunch that I have no proper claim to special marriage.

47:16.271 --> 47:25.828
He always said that my pictures were selected with a certain sense of humor.

47:26.088 --> 47:28.753
One man even

47:28.733 --> 47:36.553
I don't know, there's something that my picture says.

47:36.633 --> 47:42.287
It's a kind of unusual aspect of reality.

47:42.807 --> 47:48.557
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

47:48.577 --> 47:57.011
They could recognize a Batman picture on the blindfold.

47:57.552 --> 48:05.305
Yeah, they see that they are much better or worse than any other pictures.

48:05.285 --> 48:16.579
I have a certain general concept of what people want to see and what they want to read.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.343
This was simply embedded in me.

48:19.743 --> 48:27.613
I had no particular mind to boast about it.

48:27.593 --> 48:42.013
Another man told me when he gave him a little tour of the Batman Archive, and he really knew that I was a great admirer of Bach.

48:42.033 --> 48:50.224
He said, I mean, a very strict order that I insisted on.

48:50.244 --> 48:53.608
He said, there's a lot of Bach in the Batman Archive.

48:53.949 --> 48:56.993
Well, that sounds very good, but...

48:56.973 --> 48:59.195
I wish it had been too.

49:00.616 --> 49:08.244
I believe you have to throw a lot of stuff out, but it's a whole venue.

49:08.264 --> 49:10.586
It's not only for the venue.

49:10.606 --> 49:12.948
I'm somewhat like a writer.

49:13.028 --> 49:18.473
A writer has to throw away a lot of stuff for him.

49:18.854 --> 49:20.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:20.515 --> 49:24.759
He wants me and said, this paper is a writer's pen.

49:24.839 --> 49:25.680
This paper.

49:25.897 --> 49:29.903
Did you have many competitors after a while?

49:30.564 --> 49:36.032
No, I had one competitor, Calvert Service.

49:36.052 --> 49:39.077
He was very well known, he had wonderful stuff.

49:39.638 --> 49:50.494
He was really superior to me, for he was here in the great days of Audrey, and he was very good in early the agriculture.

49:50.514 --> 49:55.161
They're still in existence, but somehow I...

49:55.630 --> 50:01.900
He's got a little bit ahead of him by being a little more for St.

50:02.020 --> 50:09.032
Babbitt or I don't know what.

50:09.152 --> 50:12.137
And there's something, I guess,

50:12.438 --> 50:22.450
earned in the Germans, they are many obnoxious, but they are the way systematic ways.

50:22.510 --> 50:31.361
It sounds as though your filing system enabled you to satisfy a custom very easily.

50:31.381 --> 50:36.167
I talked their language a little more than others.

50:36.147 --> 50:42.761
They are all abusive people and they want to save time.

50:42.781 --> 50:56.569
So my offerings were a little bit already in the language of tutorialism and the traffic justice.

50:56.549 --> 51:02.720
You knew, you had this vision.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.304
You had this vision.

51:05.705 --> 51:09.451
People told you that you were filling with these chunks of photos.

51:09.471 --> 51:16.203
But you had an idea that this concert would do, yeah.

51:16.303 --> 51:18.186
I don't know, that was simply laughter.

51:18.402 --> 51:20.425
I had to make a living somehow.

51:20.565 --> 51:24.571
I went through a very hard time.

51:24.631 --> 51:28.015
My daughter, Beverly, who's now, is a slobber, too.

51:28.056 --> 51:47.683
She was one of my sisters, and her husband, who was from the archive, and my son, Mel, who came out of your family, and they all, I must admit, sitting pretty now.

51:47.866 --> 51:55.839
And they worked with you in the business?

51:55.879 --> 52:00.426
Yes, yes.

52:00.586 --> 52:11.764
But we moved from a cellar, evacuated coal cellar, to a building on 57th Street.

52:11.744 --> 52:18.296
It was such a place and it's right on the river.

52:18.316 --> 52:21.883
So I could walk to my office.

52:21.903 --> 52:29.837
I must admit I became a 24 hour work.

52:29.817 --> 52:38.270
My wife, my dearly, she did an awful lot of stuff.

52:38.310 --> 52:50.509
My Americanist niece had a school, we were in front of his mother, but then she was asked about her husband.

52:50.489 --> 53:01.047
He called my husband, laughing very clearly, but he always sits at the desk.

53:01.247 --> 53:03.871
I was a real German.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.454
Spending for our work.

53:05.534 --> 53:13.127
And I must admit Germans are more... How about a little something for your sweets today, everybody?

53:13.147 --> 53:14.269
Yeah, this is good.

53:14.389 --> 53:16.092
And I don't know, I asked it.

53:16.072 --> 53:18.536
Well, maybe I should have a little decaf.

53:18.616 --> 53:19.237
Decaf?

53:19.478 --> 53:20.820
Yes.

53:20.840 --> 53:29.834
To any way, but what I should is interest to, these are all right.

53:29.895 --> 53:31.397
This is all right.

53:31.377 --> 53:33.140
Did you process pictures?

53:33.160 --> 53:36.446
Did you have a dark room too or did you send all that out?

53:36.467 --> 53:41.396
You really finally, I started in my bedroom.

53:41.536 --> 53:43.780
In my bathroom was my dark room.

53:43.880 --> 53:50.112
I washed the pictures in there and squeezed them.

53:50.092 --> 53:52.215
metal plates.

53:53.316 --> 54:00.725
It started in a very small, very small vein.

54:00.745 --> 54:05.891
I always doubted whether I would make it during the beginning of World War II.

54:06.152 --> 54:13.681
I went to Washington and wanted to get a job with a single throat.

54:13.761 --> 54:16.344
My wife also was always a supporter.

54:16.404 --> 54:18.867
She ran a teacher.

54:19.049 --> 54:22.715
for the 57th year.

54:23.737 --> 54:31.950
It worked out with understanding and fairly simple life.

54:32.791 --> 54:44.390
But we had a little house up in New England always with recreation.

54:44.410 --> 54:45.732
And then

54:45.931 --> 55:02.969
But this is not really the theme of your book.

55:03.090 --> 55:04.791
I'd like to know as much as I can.

55:06.453 --> 55:10.858
You're part of the theme, actually.

55:11.328 --> 55:30.822
But I couldn't imagine living in another country.

55:31.055 --> 55:36.105
This one week that I spent it in Germany, I was most unhappy.

55:37.828 --> 55:41.996
It's the best place in the world, no doubt about it.

55:42.056 --> 55:50.953
Even if you don't have Goethe or Schiller or one of these German rivals.

55:50.933 --> 55:58.804
How did you come on the idea of licensing the pictures, of acquiring the rights?

55:59.145 --> 56:04.552
Well, you know, that is a very questionable thing.

56:04.572 --> 56:14.106
After all these pictures that you find in the picture magazine like Harper's Weekly,

56:15.250 --> 56:18.017
Ah, not copyrighted.

56:18.097 --> 56:27.201
Copyrighted, you can copyright a picture only for 40 years, then it becomes public domain.

56:27.299 --> 56:32.628
I don't know how Mr. Gates is going to solve this problem.

56:32.808 --> 56:39.660
So my field of collecting was rather limited.

56:39.680 --> 56:44.027
We went from Adam and Eve to about 1910.

56:44.047 --> 56:47.333
And he has now...

56:47.313 --> 57:04.039
So I protected myself by the fact that it is common right, I can tell you if you want a picture

57:04.019 --> 57:05.622
of Washington.

57:05.963 --> 57:12.516
Here is a picture, but I give it to you under the condition that if you use it, you must pay me.

57:13.558 --> 57:16.724
It is property right, not copyright.

57:17.185 --> 57:18.367
Very interesting.

57:19.009 --> 57:20.211
Very interesting.

57:20.311 --> 57:23.277
It has already...

57:23.257 --> 57:32.837
Stirred up some dust and it has been rightly, rightly discussed only.

57:33.038 --> 57:39.291
It is catching the user, really based on copyright.

57:39.271 --> 57:43.375
And there's also a question of... Whether he can own the copyright.

57:43.736 --> 57:47.880
The question of whether he can own the copyright of an old image.

57:48.180 --> 57:54.767
Once it's escaped across the copyright page, you... He's out of luck.

57:54.807 --> 58:03.456
There's some sort of fresh coffee coming deep after just a second.

58:05.579 --> 58:08.846
Anyway, I do a lot of talk.

58:09.247 --> 58:21.134
So actually, the service that you offered was, you had the pictures that they wanted, but they didn't even know they existed.

58:21.154 --> 58:24.381
There was always fear on their part, you see.

58:24.361 --> 58:31.694
Sometimes stole a picture, whether I had any right to it anyway.

58:32.736 --> 58:40.049
There was a stamp in fact, you know, that said, you'll be giving you this picture on the condition that you dare see.

58:40.429 --> 58:42.032
I don't know how strong it is.

58:42.012 --> 58:45.523
Oh, please, I couldn't leave.

58:45.563 --> 58:46.787
I never... You never had to?

58:47.148 --> 58:47.348
Hmm?

58:47.369 --> 58:49.656
Did you ever have to go to work?

58:49.676 --> 58:50.057
No, I didn't.

58:50.077 --> 58:53.889
Maybe I wasn't going to come up under that.

58:53.909 --> 58:54.992
Maybe I didn't know.
