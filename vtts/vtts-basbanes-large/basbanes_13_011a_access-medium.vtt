WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:04.940
I'm on now, okay?

00:05.160 --> 00:06.542
Is it good to be outside?

00:06.602 --> 00:07.683
No, this is great.

00:07.764 --> 00:08.985
Actually, this is wonderful.

00:09.005 --> 00:09.826
I love that.

00:11.128 --> 00:13.191
We're talking to Ian Jackson.

00:13.271 --> 00:15.013
How long have you been a bookseller?

00:15.033 --> 00:16.195
Since graduating from college.

00:16.235 --> 00:17.417
So from 1976.

00:17.437 --> 00:25.127
So 20 years.

00:25.147 --> 00:25.968
20 years.

00:26.028 --> 00:27.350
And where did you go to school?

00:27.951 --> 00:28.832
UC Santa Cruz.

00:29.052 --> 00:30.254
University of Oakland, Santa Cruz.

00:30.274 --> 00:31.135
And studied what?

00:31.655 --> 00:34.859
Classics, well, Greek, classical Greek, and art history.

00:35.200 --> 00:35.480
Okay.

00:36.521 --> 00:38.264
And this is a bachelor's degree?

00:38.324 --> 00:39.265
That's right, bachelor's degree.

00:39.285 --> 00:40.967
I'm a lifelong enemy of education.

00:41.668 --> 00:43.511
My father's a professor of physics.

00:43.971 --> 00:44.332
Where?

00:44.352 --> 00:46.435
And right here at Berkeley.

00:46.675 --> 00:51.421
And I only went to college because... You'd have broken your wrist.

00:51.441 --> 00:51.882
No, no, no.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.844
They were willing to pay for me to go to college.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.428
Otherwise, I would have had to get a job.

00:56.528 --> 00:58.130
So why not go to college?

00:58.170 --> 01:01.054
And Santa Cruz was an excellent university, particularly then.

01:01.304 --> 01:05.468
There were no grades, and you could do whatever you want, lots of independent studies.

01:05.508 --> 01:10.272
So basically I used the library, which was, it's quite a good library.

01:10.352 --> 01:15.718
They bought Isaac Foote, who's the father of Michael Foote, the English labor politician.

01:15.738 --> 01:21.703
I've had a lot of books, and I have no complaints.

01:22.324 --> 01:29.050
But of course the subjects I study are absolutely useless from an employment point of view unless you go to grad school, because our

01:29.536 --> 01:35.906
You know, you've got to get a PhD in Art History or Classics, and even then, certainly the Classics isn't all that important.

01:35.926 --> 01:36.948
Anyway, I've always liked books.

01:37.589 --> 01:55.999
I discovered I had a lot of... I never had a lot of money, but I had at least 1,000 books, or maybe 1,500, on graduating, and then I discovered you could sell them for more than you paid for them, and... My math, so if you graduated college in 1976, you're about 32 years old.

01:56.148 --> 01:57.430
Oh, that's 20, I see.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.491
My math is... No, no, I'm 45.

01:58.631 --> 01:59.312
You're 45.

01:59.692 --> 02:00.033
I'm 45.

02:00.173 --> 02:01.815
My math.

02:01.895 --> 02:03.176
Jet lag, math.

02:03.577 --> 02:13.769
No, I actually think I graduated, no, I must have graduated in 70... No, yes, it must be earlier, right.

02:13.829 --> 02:19.997
I graduated, no, I graduated in 70, maybe 73.

02:20.217 --> 02:22.780
That's much more likely, 73.

02:23.198 --> 02:26.222
But I didn't sell books for another year or two.

02:26.463 --> 02:30.689
I continued to read books.

02:30.869 --> 02:32.932
Okay, to read books, a lot of books.

02:33.453 --> 02:40.283
Yeah, I've always read at least, well, in those days I would read maybe 12 hours a day.

02:40.343 --> 02:43.067
Nowadays I'm down to reading only about five hours a day.

02:43.127 --> 02:44.549
Following any kind of a program?

02:44.569 --> 02:46.112
Well, I read a lot of lots of things.

02:47.393 --> 02:51.239
I'm interested in, well, that's part of the reason I'm not such a successful bookseller compared to many.

02:51.259 --> 02:52.581
I have far too many interests.

02:52.865 --> 02:55.768
and you have to pursue something a little more narrowly than I do.

02:56.549 --> 03:03.395
I'm interested in, well, I sell botanical books as my main subject, so I'm interested in the history of natural history.

03:04.777 --> 03:08.460
I still have a bit of classics, although I've practically given up reading such things.

03:10.162 --> 03:22.534
I read Italian books, French literature, English literature, a fair amount of biography history.

03:23.071 --> 03:31.021
You said earlier, just before I put the tape recorder on, that you are an enemy of education.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.423
I just like organized education.

03:32.443 --> 03:38.191
I'm an enemy to institutionalization of anything, from religion to education.

03:38.291 --> 03:44.459
I think it simply breeds vested interests.

03:44.479 --> 03:52.369
I mean, you know, the early days of Veblen and the industrialization of education, and I think...

03:53.682 --> 04:00.012
Again, I'm not a member of the ABAA, I wouldn't dream joining it, not even if it were a more admirable organization than it is.

04:00.573 --> 04:05.180
The only societies that belong to are bibliographic societies, and they are all simply publishing societies.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.943
You're basically subscribing to a journal.

04:09.286 --> 04:13.192
I tend to think institutionalization of those things breeds careerists.

04:13.593 --> 04:21.445
There are a great many people who simply go in for these things for the sake of...

04:21.813 --> 04:27.183
a certain degree of, well, money, prestige, that sort of thing.

04:27.243 --> 04:38.362
An old friend of ours who was a German émigré orientalist used to say that when she and her husband first, when they did anything in the 1930s, they did it because they wanted to do it.

04:38.683 --> 04:46.116
Nowadays, they would meet the younger UC professor types who would never dream of even getting interested in anything until they

04:46.349 --> 04:47.772
received a grant to do it.

04:48.072 --> 04:54.264
And I would find that at universities, there are many a student who would say, I don't know anything about such and such, I think I'll take a class in it.

04:54.645 --> 05:00.797
Now, they wouldn't dream of reading a book on the subject, but being lectured to was somehow a painless way of pouring the information in.

05:01.157 --> 05:03.201
I've always had complete contempt for that sort of thing.

05:03.302 --> 05:04.925
There are lots of books out there.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.169
We have an excellent public library system.

05:07.209 --> 05:08.712
If you're really interested in

05:09.029 --> 05:15.017
Swedenborg, you can go out and at least read one book before you waste, I think, a professor's time lecturing your book.

05:15.037 --> 05:23.269
And you know, the result is, of course, you get, particularly with undergraduate educators, extremely elementary lectures for people who really shouldn't be in the university.

05:23.289 --> 05:30.319
In fact, I disapprove of the spread and debasement of higher education in this country.

05:33.143 --> 05:33.383
Well,

05:34.544 --> 05:35.927
That's very curious.

05:35.947 --> 05:38.892
So what would you propose as an alternative?

05:38.912 --> 05:42.518
Well, I think there are many people who aren't really suited to intellectual pursuits.

05:43.059 --> 05:49.351
And what we've done is ruined a good blacksmith in order to make a rather poor junior college graduate.

05:49.411 --> 05:52.917
I think everyone should be, you know, elementary education is fine.

05:52.957 --> 05:54.019
Literacy is fine.

05:54.741 --> 05:58.307
I think of a person as intellectual curiosity and has been taught to read.

05:58.523 --> 06:00.346
and has opportunities.

06:00.446 --> 06:03.632
Obviously, I believe in excellent public library system.

06:03.672 --> 06:05.075
Again, that's going down the drain.

06:06.577 --> 06:10.725
From then on, if you've got some curiosity, you can progress yourself.

06:11.165 --> 06:17.497
Certain things like foreign languages are well taught by teachers, and I'm not saying dismantle elementary education, but there's so much.

06:17.737 --> 06:19.941
It's like that Babar, all shall have prizes.

06:20.191 --> 06:23.656
Everything in this country is run on a lowest common, unashamed elitist.

06:23.677 --> 06:27.603
It's run on a lowest common denominator system where everyone's got to be happy.

06:27.623 --> 06:28.604
It's like a driver's license.

06:29.025 --> 06:31.970
Everyone in this country, virtually everyone, can get a driver's license.

06:32.150 --> 06:36.597
Now, driver's license, driving requires some degree of skill, but we recognize that

06:36.779 --> 06:45.350
forbid any significant percentage of people who aren't virtually legally blind from getting a driver's license is, you know, it ruins your ability to commute somewhere or something.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.812
And it's an undue hardship.

06:46.832 --> 06:53.961
So we've simply decided on a certain standard for getting a driver's license, which virtually ensures that everyone will get a driver's license.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.563
And education is going that direction.

06:55.583 --> 07:00.730
It's so that, you know, you virtually, since you need a BA, it's virtually worthless.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.073
It's what a high school education was in the old days.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.313
and even terminal NAs, which they give out.

07:06.373 --> 07:12.279
I mean, there's people who can barely write English, who can barely string a sentence together, who have NAs.

07:12.359 --> 07:15.462
And it contributes to a debasement of everything.

07:15.482 --> 07:21.888
And I guess I'm certainly a great enemy of debasement of anything.

07:21.908 --> 07:26.973
Peter said that you have one of the great bibliographical libraries.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.736
I have a lot of books.

07:29.756 --> 07:32.318
So having said what you just said about

07:33.513 --> 07:48.973
organized education, tell me about your passion for books, and the study of books, and books as a, you know, you clearly are, you're self-educated as well, I think, is what you're telling me.

07:49.013 --> 07:50.435
Yeah, that's perhaps true.

07:50.455 --> 07:55.822
Well, even as though I've been through, you know, I've attended classes, and I've, you know, done... Things that interested you.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.765
Yeah, things that interested me.

07:59.804 --> 08:01.426
Well, that's another problem with the school system.

08:01.466 --> 08:05.712
You're basically telling the children to do such and such this week or such and such this quarter.

08:05.732 --> 08:13.063
It's never pursue this to the end of your interests and then stop, which may end up spending a year on doing something.

08:13.103 --> 08:24.840
For instance, our child, we were educating him at home, and basically he's interested in something at some point, and he has 1,500 books already himself, and he spends most of his time, he learned to read at a fairly early age.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.641
And how old is he?

08:25.661 --> 08:26.742
And he's six now.

08:27.724 --> 08:28.545
And...

08:28.846 --> 08:31.449
which at least, of course, I greeted you with his Middle Eastern cookbook.

08:31.469 --> 08:42.801
He's got this cookbook where, of course, that was a fatal thing for my wife once he learned to read because he no longer was stuck being fed what she chose to cook or what he could actually knew existed and therefore asked.

08:42.821 --> 08:50.088
He could look up in some rather complicated recipe book, see a beautiful picture of something which takes about five hours to make, point to it and say, I'd like that.

08:50.189 --> 08:50.769
It's very simple.

08:50.809 --> 08:53.232
And she's quite obliging and has cooked quite a number of these things.

08:54.413 --> 08:55.835
So there's a downside to reading.

08:55.855 --> 08:57.216
But I basically think if you...

08:57.466 --> 08:59.229
It's obviously not suitable for everyone.

09:00.070 --> 09:21.567
I don't mean to disparage forms of knowledge which aren't book-oriented, but if you do have an interest, if you absorb things through reading and have books, you can... To a great extent, I think there's been this fraudulent thing about booksellers have...

09:22.188 --> 09:25.711
tried to make books seem much more recherche, rare.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.354
You know, people will come and say, I'm really interested in such a show, but I could never really be a collector.

09:30.015 --> 09:33.358
People will, ignorant people will come and say, oh, do you have first editions?

09:33.378 --> 09:40.444
Because the book trade has spent all this time promoting first editions as something that, you know, completely artificial concept.

09:41.105 --> 09:46.349
And it intimidates people who might have some chance of being bookish otherwise.

09:46.950 --> 09:51.874
And so I'm certainly an enemy to the publicity that the booksellers

09:52.141 --> 09:59.368
seem determined to promote for the sake of their own interests.

09:59.428 --> 10:09.458
I think if books were... Well, I think an important thing, if you were writing a book about book culture and such, would be worthwhile investigating two things.

10:10.139 --> 10:17.646
One is, you probably know the famous remark of Mark Pattison, who said that no educated man should have less than 20,000 books.

10:17.666 --> 10:21.810
Pattison was the biographer of Cazabon, and rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, died about

10:22.162 --> 10:29.210
1880 or so, supposed to be the Cazabon in George Eliot's Middlemarch.

10:31.473 --> 10:33.955
Anyway, Patterson made this disparaging remark.

10:34.196 --> 10:35.978
Well, the energy of Patterson did have a great many books.

10:36.018 --> 10:38.901
Indeed, I have his set of Saint-Beuve's Coseries du Landis.

10:39.542 --> 10:51.055
And the question, though, is what relation did the 20,000 books Patterson had in 1875 bear to the totality of knowledge at that time?

10:51.254 --> 10:59.326
How many books would one need to have now in order to cover the world of learning to the depth which Patterson's 20,000 did?

10:59.366 --> 11:02.030
And my guess is it's probably something like 400,000.

11:02.050 --> 11:06.556
And even at the time, that was viewed as 20,000 was viewed.

11:06.756 --> 11:08.899
How could you have contempt for those who have fewer books?

11:10.382 --> 11:11.423
So I think that's...

11:11.639 --> 11:20.007
If you're exploring the relations of books to culture and learning, I think some quantification of that could be done in an interesting way.

11:20.287 --> 11:22.830
The other thing is to look at the diminishing audience.

11:22.850 --> 11:28.075
See, this is what I object to in the lowest common denominatorization of American, particularly American culture.

11:28.395 --> 11:34.361
I do think, you know, I'd save an immense amount of time by virtually never even looking at an American commercially published book.

11:35.081 --> 11:40.026
Yours is almost the only commercially published book, a non-university press book I've read in five years.

11:40.107 --> 11:44.112
And Norton occupies, it is Norton that published it, isn't it?

11:44.333 --> 11:44.954
Holt and Norton.

11:45.134 --> 11:59.854
You know, they are representing the elite end of it, but still, you know, you read English academics will constantly be trashing the way their book had to be rewritten for low-grade American, you know, in order to sell 100,000, you have to make it seem even stupider than it is.

11:59.894 --> 12:02.458
Now, that's happening to England is always just five years behind.

12:02.818 --> 12:07.384
I've read some absolutely horrible recent English books that are, again, absolutely the same commercialization.

12:07.725 --> 12:08.646
It seems to me...

12:08.778 --> 12:12.082
though, that this is a completely unnecessary phenomenon.

12:12.142 --> 12:25.340
If you look at the circulation of the large quarterly reviews in England in the 19th century, the quarterly, the Edinburgh, all these things, they'd be printing 20,000, 30,000 to a population vastly smaller than we have nowadays.

12:25.680 --> 12:37.215
And the actual willingness to read really quite serious journalism, which, you know, most of the stuff, again, journalism nowadays, I don't read newspapers either, or television, you know, it's just too amazing...

12:37.313 --> 12:44.620
Well, I should tell you one other thing from Sir Charles Wentworth Dilk, who would, if he hadn't committed adultery, possibly been Prime Minister.

12:44.980 --> 12:45.801
How does he spell his name?

12:46.001 --> 12:47.262
D-I-L-K-E.

12:47.282 --> 12:48.664
He was actually an interesting figure.

12:48.724 --> 13:01.596
His father was Sir Charles Wentworth Dilk, also senior, who was the publisher of Notes and Queries, which was a great monument of Victorian antiquarianism.

13:02.056 --> 13:06.240
And Dilk himself had a lot of Keats relics through his grandfather.

13:06.389 --> 13:09.552
which I think he gave to Keats' house in 1910 or so.

13:09.612 --> 13:16.179
Dilk was a very shrewd, learned, with a certain sort of pungent comments French diplomats will make.

13:16.259 --> 13:28.811
Anyway, he said he had never forgotten the advice that had been given to him when he was young by an old diplomatist, which was this, never read the newspapers if you wish to be able to distinguish between what you know and what you have just read.

13:29.752 --> 13:36.379
And so many people are, when we had this house reconstructed, all the carpenters would buy the New York Times, which admittedly is one of the better papers,

13:36.562 --> 13:39.546
down at the corner with their coffees and read and all they ever talked about.

13:39.586 --> 13:45.173
They had one idea in their, or several, a corpus of ideas in their head, which were just what they had read in the New York Times that day.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.797
I see that actually as an internet information sort of danger.

13:49.158 --> 13:54.244
No one seems obliged to actually know anything and have any command over everything if they've landed on a desert island.

13:54.484 --> 14:03.936
They think it's all out there and that they are on a, well, there's a bookseller in San Francisco who said to a friend of mine who wouldn't, I think I know who he is, but he wouldn't disclose because he knew I would satirize him,

14:04.203 --> 14:08.250
He said, you know, now with his internet stuff, I have all the resources of porridge.

14:08.270 --> 14:10.875
Well, he's got all the resources of porridge, except the brains of porridge.

14:11.416 --> 14:16.805
And I think this is going to breed an enormous amount of conceit among people.

14:16.965 --> 14:19.350
I mean, you can see students know less and less.

14:19.370 --> 14:27.544
The people under, the pre-computer people that I've seen, post-computer people I've seen, the youth,

14:27.845 --> 14:30.628
they really do seem to me to be amazingly ignorant.

14:30.648 --> 14:36.755
Now, my generation is viewed as ignorant by the ones before that, but I think it's very distressing to you.

14:36.775 --> 14:42.761
They have no notion of finding anything, and they don't really think they need to have anything in their heads to begin with.

14:43.502 --> 14:45.424
And their conversation is worth it.

14:45.464 --> 14:51.350
If you can't think to begin with, and you have no facts to exercise your thoughts upon, it's a waste of time to talk to you.

14:51.410 --> 14:55.254
And I find that group of people is steadily increasing.

14:55.274 --> 14:56.856
But what I was going to tell you with the...

14:57.140 --> 14:58.783
circulation of these quarterlies.

14:59.184 --> 15:02.311
You can also look at the decay of publishing.

15:02.691 --> 15:10.928
You can see the sort of books that would be published by a commercial publisher in 19th century England are now only viable with the university press.

15:10.968 --> 15:16.600
And if you look at, university presses don't like to publicize how few copies they print, and the remainder half of them usually,

15:16.900 --> 15:20.765
Many a university press book is printed in only 500 to 1,000 copies.

15:20.805 --> 15:23.508
Or in fact even fewer.

15:23.628 --> 15:30.736
Of course, if they said that, people would with their carefully tooled by the bookseller or carefully schooled by the bookseller's notion of artificial rarities.

15:30.756 --> 15:32.458
They would think, oh, you know, there are only 500.

15:32.498 --> 15:33.760
I'd better grab mine now.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.725
The fact is there are probably only 200 people in the world who actually want the thing.

15:37.745 --> 15:42.790
The university press doesn't want to indicate to its backers, the university, that their books are of such minimal interest.

15:43.331 --> 15:44.933
I mean, you'll get outside...

15:45.166 --> 15:52.016
commentators, ordinary citizens saying, why are we supporting this university press when only 200 people ever buy the book?

15:52.536 --> 15:58.785
In Victorian times, a commercial publisher without subsidy would be, you look at John Murray, publisher of Byron.

15:58.805 --> 16:05.014
Murray published this whole series of books by William Smith of Dictionary of Classical Biography.

16:05.134 --> 16:07.257
They were in fact going to do a dictionary of national biography.

16:07.358 --> 16:09.821
Even they couldn't quite make that remunerative.

16:09.841 --> 16:12.625
It had to be subsidized by Smith, eventually published by him.

16:13.006 --> 16:13.266
But

16:13.432 --> 16:18.619
these books would be published by a commercial publisher, immense investment over a long period of time.

16:18.659 --> 16:21.242
Now, you could get scholars to work for a little less, perhaps.

16:21.582 --> 16:22.764
Printing was a little cheaper.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.768
But nonetheless, these things would be bought by 5,000 or 10,000 people.

16:26.268 --> 16:36.081
Again, if you compare that to the population and extrapolate to today, these are books that are like modern bestsellers, things that would be selling the equivalent of

16:36.314 --> 16:37.215
200,000, 300,000.

16:37.475 --> 16:56.415
And the whole, the Victorian era, I think, is a time when ordinary people had far more intellect, far more sort of, not quite groupish, but there was an esteem that the learned man, the Victorian sage, held on the stage, which doesn't exist anymore.

16:56.455 --> 16:59.518
And of course, America's always had a pronounced anti-intellectual element.

16:59.899 --> 17:05.865
But even so, even allowing for that aberration, we have really, I think, fallen enormously

17:06.048 --> 17:08.612
And what is the... You know, it's just continuing on.

17:08.952 --> 17:10.715
Films, of course, I don't go to films either.

17:12.197 --> 17:15.581
You know, everything is just made for the stupidest, lowest common denominator.

17:16.062 --> 17:24.534
It's unfortunate that democracy is always seen as a... You know, running the world by the rabble.

17:24.574 --> 17:30.682
If you look at Greek democracy, it was really not necessarily... Not released, where I was saying, go back to the Greeks.

17:30.782 --> 17:34.047
But, you know, it's not as though I don't feel...

17:34.853 --> 18:03.004
you know, that we shouldn't be run by people, we should have a representative government, but I do think that if one suddenly allowed, the vote has been again so debased, just like the book, if you simply gave people the chance to vote for four years every 15 years, or three years every 15 years, so you suddenly reduce the voting population to a fifth of what it is at any given moment, you would then suddenly, we have such enormous quantities of people here,

18:03.220 --> 18:07.466
that you feel, I mean, what's the use of the vote except possibly in the Berkeley mayoral election?

18:07.506 --> 18:10.691
It's totally useless once you get up to the representative or presidential level.

18:10.891 --> 18:24.210
If you could artificially reduce the number of people, everyone gets their chance at a certain time, then you could really feel, someone like myself might feel, yes, I should really actually get interested in the issues and actually possibly read a newspaper to make an informed vote.

18:24.230 --> 18:32.822
At the moment, I simply have general principles of life from years of observation, and these people are such cardboard figures that you don't really need to know anything about them.

18:33.190 --> 18:37.358
And, well, at any rate, we're getting far from books.

18:37.378 --> 18:38.399
No, actually, it's pretty interesting.

18:40.303 --> 18:45.673
I'm wondering, though, with that attitude, how is it that you can make a living as a bookseller?

18:45.733 --> 18:46.654
Who likes your books?

18:46.674 --> 18:47.756
Oh, you see, I should, yes.

18:47.816 --> 18:53.687
When I retire, I should tell, I do everything wrong, according to conventional bookselling wisdom.

18:53.988 --> 18:55.350
I'm not in the telephone book.

18:55.972 --> 18:57.814
I'm not in the Yellow Pages.

18:57.994 --> 18:59.416
I'm a member of no trade orgs.

18:59.476 --> 19:04.062
I virtually have no publicity, and you would never have found out for me if it weren't for Peter Howard.

19:04.763 --> 19:10.850
I don't drive a car, which eliminates hauling large numbers of books.

19:11.591 --> 19:14.374
I only print 125 catalogs.

19:15.115 --> 19:16.036
I don't have a computer.

19:16.077 --> 19:17.919
That's the most uneconomic aspect.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.562
I despise computers.

19:20.812 --> 19:24.236
If I had a computer, of course, I could make my catalogs much cheaper.

19:24.276 --> 19:29.121
What I actually do is type up on the typewriter that my father typed his thesis on.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.362
Manual typewriter?

19:30.663 --> 19:32.024
Manual typewriter in old Remington.

19:32.384 --> 19:33.165
It has a great advantage.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.327
We were Canadian originally.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.928
It's an old Canadian typewriter.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.711
It's got pound sign, which is very useful.

19:38.751 --> 19:43.817
It's not usually on an American typewriter, and since I sell a lot of books to England, it's quite helpful.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.301
But I type it out on a slip, and then I have an elderly typist in San Francisco.

19:47.321 --> 19:50.464
It's about 70, and our eyesight's beginning to go, so I may have to face

19:50.849 --> 20:14.494
changes sometimes, but I keep her, she types it up for me, so that costs a lot of extra money, and when you divide out the total, you know, I pay her, say, for typing up a 20-page catalog, I pay her $400 or $500, well worth it, but you divide that out by the $125 that you do, you end up, although my catalogs are relatively poorly produced,

20:14.761 --> 20:16.823
I end up with the postage and everything.

20:16.883 --> 20:21.709
They cost about $3 a piece, which, again, is hopelessly uneconomical.

20:21.769 --> 20:25.513
However, I have... Did Peter show you any of my titles?

20:25.533 --> 20:26.915
Well, they're in the vein... I'll give you some.

20:27.115 --> 20:31.300
They're in the vein of at least the annotations.

20:31.340 --> 20:36.446
You remember there are two, if he gave you the two volumes of Clare Hughes.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.608
The first one had virtually no notes.

20:38.909 --> 20:43.313
And then I realized in sending it off to foreign friends, they wouldn't have any idea what's going on.

20:43.494 --> 20:47.778
Well, I was looking for the author in the first record.

20:47.798 --> 20:48.839
Yeah, it's even anonymous.

20:48.859 --> 20:53.544
Of course, I'm completely behind those scenes, and I mean, I don't publicize myself at all.

20:53.604 --> 20:56.687
But you did indicate your authorship on the back of the second one.

20:56.707 --> 21:01.792
Because some people said, oh, you know, you're, well, Rostenberg and Stern called it a filthy anonymous libel.

21:01.812 --> 21:04.815
So I decided I'd better not be anonymous, although I thought it was perfectly well-known.

21:04.855 --> 21:08.359
I made no secret of my authorship.

21:08.727 --> 21:13.594
The second one, I added notes of the sort that I've written one by one to friends abroad.

21:14.255 --> 21:16.999
And that's very much in the vein of my catalogs.

21:17.039 --> 21:22.686
My catalogs have much to I will sell books for $10 or $12 and maybe have a 15-line description.

21:23.007 --> 21:30.297
However, you know, I shouldn't be the one to say it, but they have an entertainment value beyond that of most people.

21:30.597 --> 21:31.519
people's catalogs.

21:31.539 --> 21:35.370
And the result is that people like to stay on my mailing list.

21:35.390 --> 21:42.187
And my actual response from any given catalog is, I think, far higher than most people's.

21:42.368 --> 21:47.020
I send out 125 of which possibly 25 are just old friends

21:47.371 --> 21:54.979
Many of them have lots of books, but they're in their 70s and aren't buying them anymore, or just friends of mine that I don't expect to buy books.

21:55.039 --> 21:59.023
But of the remaining, so those people get the catalogs free without my worrying about it.

21:59.044 --> 22:04.249
The remaining 100, those people do have to buy books, although I never rub in the fact.

22:04.690 --> 22:13.679
It's fairly obvious when you see only 125 printed and that they perhaps ought to buy a book merely to keep on my mailing list.

22:13.699 --> 22:17.243
So I have, I would say that of the 100 who are supposed to be live customers,

22:17.662 --> 22:23.794
possibly 60, sometimes even 60 or 70 of them actually order from every catalog.

22:23.814 --> 22:26.980
Now, most people don't get that level of response.

22:27.061 --> 22:34.255
Of course, some of the books are already sold, but I tend to sell, of the English language books, I certainly sell 90 or 95 percent.

22:35.157 --> 22:37.581
French, maybe only 60 percent.

22:37.662 --> 22:39.906
Italian, when I have Italian books,

22:40.156 --> 22:46.225
maybe only 20 or 30, but overall I sell certainly 80 or 90% of the books, which again is much higher than most people.

22:46.245 --> 22:50.412
So others are sending out, you know, 1,000 catalogs at much higher prices.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.717
My prices are cheap.

22:54.678 --> 22:55.880
The prices are quite your books.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.902
My books are very cheap.

22:57.262 --> 22:59.646
I largely sell to other booksellers.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.188
And I think that's another aspect.

23:01.209 --> 23:07.378
The bookseller realizes the economics of it and realizes he wants to continue to get my catalogs that he's better...

23:07.797 --> 23:33.855
uh order a book and i but i do also have it um i think also contributing to this is that i say prompt payment expect i don't demand advanced payment but prompt payment and i do get prompt payment even from people who according to other uh booksellers never pay other people in less than six months uh to stay on my mailing list as a source of supply um will pay quite promptly so i don't have any trouble with that and i also um

23:34.932 --> 23:43.659
One further thing is that I have, they're always in a catalog, there's some interesting books that you can sell easily and possibly for vastly more money than I asked.

23:43.860 --> 23:45.301
But there also are some ordinary books.

23:45.321 --> 23:48.404
They don't always have wonderful things.

23:48.424 --> 24:04.197
And if a person has received your catalog and he doesn't want any of the better or more interesting books, and yet he wants to stay on your mailing list, he will always be able to find a bibliography, say, that he, I've always been meaning to buy Young's Bibliography of Memory,

24:04.379 --> 24:13.891
but, you know, just to keep Ian Jackson happy, I'll order it this time, whereas you don't have that feeling with somebody who's just going to keep sending your catalogs whether you order it or not.

24:14.452 --> 24:30.572
And I've... Anyway, I have the customer well-trained, and I have a... I'm an unforgiving... You know, if you don't pay promptly and you don't order books, I basically ditch you from my mailing list, and I don't feel...

24:30.788 --> 24:43.123
And also, the people who've been sort of dickering, these people up at the high end who have grossly overpriced books, they have to take people out to dinner, they have to give them special credit terms, they'll be asked for discounts.

24:43.223 --> 24:45.666
Nobody ever asks me for a discount.

24:45.686 --> 24:55.177
And I find that what I've tried to do is make my books as cheap as I possibly can so that ordinary people can just buy them.

24:55.197 --> 24:59.142
These other people, or not all of them, but some people who have rather inflated prices

24:59.392 --> 25:01.134
are simply, or sell a lot to libraries.

25:01.175 --> 25:02.016
I never sell to libraries.

25:02.036 --> 25:03.578
Well, there are one or two libraries.

25:03.618 --> 25:04.659
I don't sell to libraries.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.061
Libraries take forever to pay.

25:06.802 --> 25:09.366
You can send a lot of catalogs and you never feel obliged to buy.

25:09.646 --> 25:14.193
Occasionally a library has a live person there who's virtually like reaching a collector.

25:14.573 --> 25:21.323
Tony Shipps used to be at the University of Indiana, and he would always order five or ten books.

25:21.383 --> 25:23.045
He took early retirement to work on his.

25:23.085 --> 25:27.171
He's writing a dictionary of all the quotations that have never been identified by anyone else.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.942
He's been doing this for years and years.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.443
He used to always write notes and queries.

25:30.844 --> 25:33.767
Notes and queries is now, of course, a horribly debased journal.

25:34.708 --> 25:37.712
But it used to have a lot of queries that you could get answers.

25:37.732 --> 25:39.814
And Tony Shipp's the only person who ever answers anything.

25:39.834 --> 25:48.284
And he'll have anything from a recognized minor masterwork of English literature to, he'll say, that quotation comes from heartthrobs 1914.

25:48.305 --> 25:50.307
His range of reading is enormously wide.

25:50.647 --> 25:57.175
So he's retired with his pile of last 50 years as a New Yorker and various other things to write this quotation dictionary.

25:58.049 --> 25:59.171
But he would order books.

25:59.271 --> 26:02.857
And when Marcus McCorson was at the American Antiquarian Society, he would order books.

26:02.877 --> 26:05.521
But of course, those people are real bookmen.

26:05.621 --> 26:12.713
Most librarians, unlike my hierarchy, the booksellers, to my mind, although I despise many of them, are certainly at the top.

26:13.234 --> 26:17.521
Collectors a fair way down, and librarians even below.

26:17.581 --> 26:23.230
Librarians, especially in this country, not quite so much in England, and certainly not in the rare books.

26:23.497 --> 26:25.983
But they're really just administrators.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.366
They aren't really bookish people at all.

26:27.607 --> 26:29.391
You look at the glorification of Panizzi.

26:29.411 --> 26:40.898
Panizzi, who, in my opinion, was just an Italian mafioso and always in loggerheads with people like Madden or Edward Edwards, people who had their certain gross personality problems, although I think no worse than Panizzi.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.642
but weren't socially connected.

26:42.662 --> 26:57.184
You know, Penizzi had the charm of being an Italian refugee in the era when every, you know, Englishman was promoting, you know, anti-papal, anti-French, anti, you know, Italian Mazzini and all that, Garibaldi and such.

26:57.444 --> 27:02.171
So he had this aura of the oppressed refugee and good connections with Glaxon.

27:02.191 --> 27:06.397
But what he is is not, he did write some somewhat scholarly works in early youth.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.522
So it was basically a wheeler dealer managed to get large appropriations.

27:09.542 --> 27:10.463
I mean, all credit to him.

27:10.612 --> 27:13.397
But he's the prototype of modern big administrator.

27:13.417 --> 27:19.487
And that's why he gets, when you read the biographies of Panizzi, the modern one by Edward Miller is just a piece.

27:19.547 --> 27:25.838
It's by a British Museum bureaucrat who recognizes the father figure to all other bureaucrats.

27:25.858 --> 27:28.142
And even the British Library is going down the drain.

27:28.162 --> 27:36.096
It's got these, the last generation of scholar librarians has basically quit when it became the British Library instead of being the British Museum.

27:36.329 --> 27:58.354
and uh you know it's run by these people who barely know what they're doing it's much better than in this country but librarians to me are down at the bottom um so i don't sell to them apart from numerous other things although there are i have good friends in libraries but i think they're uh they they would wholeheartedly endorse um uh what i say this whole concept then which you that i

27:58.621 --> 28:06.128
I wasn't going to bring it up, but you mentioned this passion for first editions and condition of the dust jacket and all this other stuff.

28:07.129 --> 28:15.337
But collecting, then, as defined by the ABAA and all these other people on the book fairs, this is not something that you find terribly interesting.

28:15.357 --> 28:17.780
No, I despise it, and I think it an evil thing.

28:17.800 --> 28:26.428
And in fact, if you're starting to study books in culture, this is what directly contributes to the destruction of any notion among ordinary people.

28:26.608 --> 28:28.290
They can buy books, old books.

28:28.591 --> 28:33.758
To many people, particularly in California, an old book is something 30 years old.

28:34.159 --> 28:43.212
And most of this paperback, the yellow highlighter, all these things, just unfamiliarity of books to people.

28:43.713 --> 28:51.684
And it's promoted by this... The book trade has always had to reduce the number of things that are officially collectible.

28:51.724 --> 28:53.887
Now, I recognize that as an economic necessity.

28:54.228 --> 28:55.830
The huge quantity of books...

28:56.148 --> 29:01.554
that are dumped on the market has to be somehow reduced.

29:01.694 --> 29:09.903
If you took every copy of Gone with the Wind that's out there, you'd simply, every bookseller would have five copies on a shelf, and why buy one from me and not from someone else?

29:10.143 --> 29:15.449
You have to squeeze it down to the, you know, the first edition, the first edition with a certain point.

29:15.829 --> 29:19.513
The first edition, of course, has become really first impression.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.976
Really, it's first edition with a number of impressions.

29:22.016 --> 29:23.758
I noticed you use

29:24.008 --> 29:25.650
I think, well, I'm not.

29:25.850 --> 29:26.772
That's fine.

29:26.792 --> 29:27.412
I get it wrong.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.716
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:29.736 --> 29:34.642
I didn't feel you got it wrong because publishers like to call them additions because, of course, it looks like more.

29:34.662 --> 29:40.490
It does seem as though your book went through three impressions and then had a corrected fourth impression that we could call another edition.

29:40.510 --> 29:41.611
No, actually, I have changes.

29:41.631 --> 29:42.512
Yeah, well, that's what I mean.

29:42.532 --> 29:46.177
It could be either a corrected impression or a new edition, so I wasn't going to.

29:46.357 --> 29:53.627
But there is this general feeling that you can get the same text if it's a completely uncorrected second impression, as it very often is,

29:53.759 --> 29:56.062
It's the identical text, and it's almost worthless.

29:56.222 --> 29:59.866
I think this is destroyed, particularly with modern literature.

30:00.267 --> 30:13.101
It's made a... You know, I'm in favor of people who read books, and modern literature collecting, of course, if you've been the Bokov collector and stuff, you get people collecting books in Russian which they can't read.

30:13.181 --> 30:19.168
I don't think people have much business buying books, except possibly to give them to libraries, that they can't read.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.471
I think...

30:22.666 --> 30:28.312
When you sell books in Greek, then, is it with the expectation that the people that are buying or reading are Greek?

30:28.332 --> 30:31.256
Well, apart from the booksellers, yes.

30:31.276 --> 30:41.067
I don't sell a great many books in Greek, partly because there's a rapacious or somewhat rapacious black oak around the corner who will buy most of the things before anyone else.

30:41.087 --> 30:48.876
No, it just breeds a sort of false...

30:49.193 --> 30:56.120
sense in the collectors, this notion if I have piles of books, I somehow have painlessly absorbed the knowledge simply by looking at the spines or touching them.

30:56.681 --> 31:05.429
And most collectors in my mind are pseudo, well, these are collectors in the ABAA sense, are basically pseudo-scholars.

31:05.449 --> 31:06.430
And I'm interested in this.

31:06.450 --> 31:06.891
Yeah.

31:06.911 --> 31:09.413
See, I sell mostly, of course, professors have gone down the drain.

31:09.453 --> 31:14.498
They used to buy books, but they have very little space with these compulsory retirements, move out of your office.

31:15.119 --> 31:18.002
In the old days when, particularly in England, where you could

31:18.218 --> 31:25.306
you know, live in your rooms for the rest of your life and you had five rooms over the Trinity Gateway or something, you could have 20,000 books and no one would ever kick you out.

31:25.626 --> 31:36.017
Nowadays, somebody retires from being professor or lecturer in English literature and they've got to get rid of all the books in their office because they squeeze down and you find that no one accumulates these 20,000.

31:36.057 --> 31:39.881
They may have 5,000 of which they get rid of 3,000 every so often.

31:40.442 --> 31:44.727
And professors, I think, are, you know, the libraries are too good.

31:45.067 --> 31:46.048
Harney Rosenthal,

31:46.180 --> 32:04.223
His uncle, Leonardo Olschke, came over from Italy to be in the university here, and he no longer had to have this giant private library, which all German scholars used to have.

32:04.503 --> 32:05.685
You needed a private library.

32:06.105 --> 32:13.875
There's a collector, in fact, the only person I really do sell Greek books to, Bill Calder, who's the old father professor of...

32:14.564 --> 32:16.908
The History of Classical Scholarship at the University of Illinois.

32:16.928 --> 32:18.130
He has a very large library.

32:18.831 --> 32:20.573
Started buying it very young at Harvard.

32:20.673 --> 32:27.404
Got wife memberships as birthday presents from various aunts and uncles in, you know, philological societies at a young age.

32:27.424 --> 32:28.305
Knew what he wanted to do.

32:28.746 --> 32:35.897
Also noticed that great scholars, if you don't have a huge amount of money, needed a good library, he feels.

32:36.198 --> 32:39.403
and that a wife and family is incompatible with this.

32:39.583 --> 32:45.633
And he points out, he's got a list of classical scholars with huge libraries, all of whom were bachelors.

32:45.713 --> 32:54.326
And again, if you look at 19th century era when there were large libraries, the number of unmarried people is really quite large.

32:54.366 --> 32:59.634
And it's not, you know, we nowadays look at, say, the huge amount of prostitution in Paris and the number of unmarried people.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.497
A lot of it is pure economics.

33:01.831 --> 33:09.981
It's to set up a family, to get a wife implies having children, implies having to have an estate, implies lots of other things.

33:10.261 --> 33:17.670
Nowadays, we notice, I mean, there are many people who simply get married and don't necessarily think they're going, they think they can still live a pleasant, yuppie lifestyle.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.512
In those days, you really couldn't.

33:19.552 --> 33:26.701
And so, of course, you, and as long as you have large quantities of prostitutes and very own mistresses and stuff, things that cost a certain amount without the family establishment.

33:27.001 --> 33:29.384
And books require, well, of course, they require a huge amount of space.

33:29.764 --> 33:30.505
Most people,

33:30.687 --> 33:34.356
who live in apartments nowadays, can't afford to have a huge quantity of books.

33:34.857 --> 33:46.204
And with the large number that are now printed or available, again, to cover it in even the mildly, the Patersonian way, you need more books than people can afford to have.

33:46.585 --> 33:48.730
So if they don't have any scholarly advancement

33:48.963 --> 33:51.852
They simply, you get some author where you can have it in a bookcase.

33:51.932 --> 33:54.640
I'll collect all of Nabokov, all of Stephen King or something.

33:54.921 --> 34:00.638
And it's also that you, as other people around you, where you're stupider and stupider, you want something you can talk to them about.

34:00.658 --> 34:02.483
Look at Folger and his...

34:02.682 --> 34:03.323
Shakespeare.

34:03.623 --> 34:04.844
Everyone has heard of Shakespeare.

34:04.885 --> 34:07.087
Everyone possibly has even heard of the first folio.

34:07.327 --> 34:09.970
If you go around and at a cocktail party people say, what do you do?

34:10.010 --> 34:11.232
And you say, oh, it's piles of books.

34:11.492 --> 34:13.374
If you can say, oh, yes, I've got a lot of Shakespeare's.

34:13.575 --> 34:20.843
I mean, his problem was, pre-Hinman Collator, is that he had, you know, 79 copies of these things, which did look a bit like overkill.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.545
We may not think now that it is.

34:22.865 --> 34:30.414
Look at the fellow Mayfield, I don't know if he's in your book, who collected Swinburne, you know, to prove that more than 100 copies of, I've forgotten what it was, were ever printed.

34:30.975 --> 34:31.255
And...

34:31.488 --> 34:33.832
You know, that was, in my mind, idiotic collecting.

34:33.852 --> 34:37.578
It's the machine level of, it's not early printing.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.220
What's that?

34:39.240 --> 34:39.601
I don't know.

34:39.681 --> 34:47.754
John S. Mayfield, he should be in Dickinson's.

34:47.774 --> 34:50.739
I think he gave his books maybe to Rochester or something.

34:50.759 --> 34:53.483
He collected other things, but Swinburne and such.

34:53.503 --> 34:56.027
He published, I think, a little book on Swinburne.

34:56.395 --> 35:00.681
You know, it's just, it seems to me it's a pointless, but that sort of thing is encouraged by books.

35:00.741 --> 35:04.986
I mean, Peter Howe is just a toady to his customers, and they want something.

35:05.347 --> 35:08.571
This is why he's gotten into all this trouble with these screenplays.

35:08.771 --> 35:18.724
You know, it's Peter's, I think there's a, I'm not to get into the morality of it, but I think Peter has, he has gone after these things because

35:18.957 --> 35:20.979
A completist customer has to have them.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.603
Peter wants to feel the motto of serendipity books is service.

35:24.803 --> 35:28.227
If it can humanly be God, we will get it for you.

35:28.788 --> 35:37.277
To me, and you know, to some people who are like that go to immense pains and possibly well-deserve the greater amount of money they feel that is due to them.

35:38.438 --> 35:43.243
To myself, I try to sell to people who are possibly halfway capable of getting it for themselves.

35:43.460 --> 35:55.879
who aren't idiots, who want something sensible, and I therefore try to reduce my involvement to a minimum.

35:55.919 --> 35:58.824
I try to provide an honest, clear description of the book.

35:58.844 --> 36:01.968
When it's something that everyone knows about, I don't have a blurb at all.

36:02.269 --> 36:08.218
If it's something that maybe no one has heard of or doesn't realize that this is the first mention of...

36:09.262 --> 36:15.652
cyanide in English literature, I might then point it out and try to sell it.

36:15.672 --> 36:18.376
And my blurbs also, no, no, Aldo.

36:18.697 --> 36:26.068
My blurbs also have an element, since they're largely directed to booksellers, largely directed to booksellers.

36:26.248 --> 36:27.530
Just, Aldo, go inside.

36:27.751 --> 36:29.313
Don't attack this thing.

36:29.333 --> 36:29.613
Come on.

36:30.014 --> 36:30.294
In there.

36:30.655 --> 36:30.875
In there.

36:30.915 --> 36:31.697
Did you want lunch?

36:32.458 --> 36:32.618
No?

36:32.798 --> 36:35.282
She's about to make... Aldo, just go.

36:35.422 --> 36:35.763
Come on.

36:35.803 --> 36:37.125
Don't attack, please.

36:37.460 --> 36:43.830
I was talking about... I'm sorry, I arrived, so it was unexpected.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.773
No, she's quite a good cook.

36:45.813 --> 36:47.015
You could have lunch made by her.

36:47.696 --> 36:48.598
Yeah, well, go ahead.

36:48.838 --> 36:50.080
There's going to be one something.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.023
Fine, Anna.

36:53.366 --> 37:00.537
Let's see, we were talking about... Well, we were talking about, we went from John Mayfield to... Oh, my catalogs, yes, not selling to you.

37:00.557 --> 37:00.918
Yes, exactly.

37:01.198 --> 37:02.040
I should show you a few.

37:02.140 --> 37:02.961
I think I might have

37:03.295 --> 37:06.178
I saved a couple of old book dealers with reviews in my catalogs.

37:06.218 --> 37:13.607
In one of them, James Ferguson, I think, says quite correctly, you know, I specialize in constructing immense houses of cards about books.

37:14.148 --> 37:19.594
And there is certainly an element of self-parody or parody of other booksellers.

37:19.694 --> 37:23.098
One looks at the way people sell things, which I'm a keen student of.

37:24.159 --> 37:28.464
Garrison Morton, for instance, if a medical book is in Garrison Morton, it's saleable.

37:28.484 --> 37:30.727
If a medical book isn't in Garrison Morton, it's unsaleable.

37:30.747 --> 37:31.868
In fact, in my last catalog,

37:31.966 --> 37:37.056
I was selling a long run of something relatively unsaleable, the Nobel Prize Lectures.

37:37.957 --> 37:45.291
I bought Melvin Calvin's library, the discoverer of the chemistry of photosynthesis, and he won the Nobel Prize at an early age, and every year afterwards he got it.

37:45.311 --> 37:46.273
So it fills a lot of space.

37:48.216 --> 37:52.665
But I did point out that it does include a couple of items in Garrison Morton.

37:52.685 --> 37:55.510
It's probably because Jeremy Norman couldn't do the last revision.

37:55.777 --> 38:23.961
couldn't find if a person has done their discovery isn't some ethic making paper like the dna where you can actually say this is now collectible um and the simpler person did 15 20 years of researchers reported 200 things and for his cumulative knowledge as with calvin you don't have an actual breakthrough paper there's this physical science aspect of einstein all these you know sudden you're sitting here e equals mc squared you've got this thing you can have it on a piece of paper it becomes a talisman object

38:24.177 --> 38:27.081
And I'm sure this is very characteristic, even no more.

38:27.341 --> 38:37.234
This is a greater significance and reality to the book-collecting mind than something that is simply long and patient labor that can't be crystallized in a purchasable entity.

38:37.474 --> 38:43.642
So you get this fetishistic, fetish object formation for bookselling.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.005
And so you have this long run of these things.

38:46.065 --> 38:50.691
And so one of these things is in Garrison Morton, Eccles' little thing on brain.

38:51.127 --> 38:58.234
So I pointed out in my blurb, I said, booksellers who... This run does contain a few items in Garrison Morton.

38:58.494 --> 39:02.999
Booksellers who spend their waking hours on bended knee before this brazen idol.

39:03.099 --> 39:03.660
Please note.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.643
Well, Jeremy Norman called up and ordered it, the reviser of it.

39:06.663 --> 39:09.045
He said, yes, I agree with you completely about Garrison Morton.

39:09.506 --> 39:12.969
If it had, it was five times the size, it might actually be comprehensive.

39:14.431 --> 39:16.713
So, you know, all of us are playing some sort of game.

39:16.753 --> 39:18.855
Printing in the mind of man...

39:19.797 --> 39:29.793
You know, if you talk to anyone who was involved, or you look at the earlier thing, the thing done by Stanley Morrison in 1940 of the proto-printing of the Mind of Man, which has completely different books.

39:30.294 --> 39:36.323
You know, they both have a Newton Principia and a Gutenberg Bible, but the rest of the thing is much more in the English literature.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.366
The science craze hasn't taken over.

39:38.486 --> 39:45.197
And, you know, this is just checklist, ridiculous checklist, but it's the only way that

39:45.633 --> 39:56.403
Many booksellers, I think of rather dim capacities, have found to convert a teeming mass of books, which are complicated to learn about, into things that are easily saleable.

39:56.423 --> 39:59.907
Well, I was just looking at Rick Watson's catalog here.

39:59.947 --> 40:02.249
This is an excess of deprecation.

40:03.130 --> 40:06.133
But he said, all I know about is expensive books.

40:06.153 --> 40:09.897
And this could be said with more justification by quite a number of other booksellers.

40:09.917 --> 40:13.480
Now, the expense has nothing to do with the...

40:13.595 --> 40:15.918
even the collectability or the value of the book.

40:15.958 --> 40:22.427
To me, I'm trying to sell, since I like to sell, the more a person knows, the better suited they are to be a customer.

40:22.447 --> 40:24.269
I'm not trying to swindle anyone.

40:24.950 --> 40:28.915
Well, I'd be reluctant to say that certain booksellers are trying to swindle.

40:29.196 --> 40:35.324
It's nonetheless, they sell to ignorant people, and they're not telling them every bit of the fact.

40:35.444 --> 40:42.133
Very few booksellers, for instance, feel themselves obliged to tell you that a second edition of a practical bibliography, let's say,

40:42.316 --> 40:47.623
that a second edition vastly enlarged was published, and you really shouldn't waste your money buying this.

40:47.643 --> 40:49.365
To my mind, I tell them that.

40:49.645 --> 40:59.397
Of course, if I had the second edition vastly improved at $100, and I have the first edition, I'll be charging $10 for the not terribly good first edition thought.

40:59.798 --> 41:01.059
I tried to put it in proportion.

41:01.099 --> 41:04.003
I feel if the improved version is worth $100,

41:04.085 --> 41:08.629
then there is a genuine value to the one that isn't quite as good, and it may only be $10.

41:08.669 --> 41:12.873
The person who's trying to sell the not-so-good one for $75 doesn't want to tell you that.

41:12.893 --> 41:18.258
I don't say that's dishonest, but it's very frequently done.

41:18.538 --> 41:29.368
To me, I feel if the person possibly already knows this, he doesn't know it, since I've made the price so low, he knows he's getting something that isn't as good, but he's also not paying very much.

41:29.388 --> 41:30.769
You can see an actual relation.

41:31.069 --> 41:31.830
There's a lot of

41:33.042 --> 41:47.142
A lot of booksellers are trying to get by on... It seems to me too... Well, I shouldn't trash booksellers because actually who'd sell books requires more... who'd sell books well requires... is always grossly underpaid.

41:47.242 --> 41:48.384
Even somebody like H.P.

41:48.404 --> 41:53.852
Krauss, by comparison, I mean, we should be comparing him to the head of the Davis Insurance Company or something.

41:54.232 --> 41:58.358
I mean, you know, he's in many ways a despicable person, but...

41:58.490 --> 42:02.317
Nonetheless, if you rank it with tycoons of business, there's nothing horribly wrong.

42:02.337 --> 42:02.958
And there are other people.

42:02.978 --> 42:04.741
I mean, Arthur Freeman is no doubt paid or evil.

42:04.761 --> 42:05.943
He's now resigned from Horwich.

42:05.963 --> 42:08.047
But Horwich no doubt paid him quite a lot of money.

42:08.327 --> 42:09.590
But Arthur is well worth that.

42:09.630 --> 42:11.092
No, no, no.

42:11.132 --> 42:13.457
I got a fax from him a month or about two weeks ago.

42:13.517 --> 42:13.997
Yeah, he's left.

42:14.579 --> 42:15.741
September 1st.

42:16.742 --> 42:17.123
Really?

42:18.757 --> 42:19.638
Interesting.

42:19.658 --> 42:20.660
I wonder if he's staying in England.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.162
Yeah, he's always staying in England.

42:22.182 --> 42:26.089
Well, they're working on that Collier life, and he's quite entrenched.

42:26.329 --> 42:28.172
Have you visited him at his house?

42:28.232 --> 42:29.554
No, I think quite.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.597
Well, he's got this huge, I mean, he could never use it.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.761
He probably owns the flat that he's living in.

42:34.081 --> 42:37.727
And he's got, he must have at least 15,000 works there.

42:37.907 --> 42:39.310
Steve Weissman's got a new house.

42:40.011 --> 42:40.832
Uh-huh, right, yeah.

42:41.173 --> 42:42.655
Well, they're all, you look at what happens.

42:42.702 --> 42:57.344
Americans, although I've trashed American culture in front of you, which I think is well worthy of trashing, it's simply because we cater to the lowest grade of humanity, do it extremely well, and we can export that, because there's low-grade humanity all across the world.

42:57.665 --> 42:59.708
But we export our finest brains.

42:59.748 --> 43:11.005
If you look at the American booksellers who have gone to England, Rick Watson, Stephen Weissman, Ted Hoffman, Arthur Freeman, Stuart Bennett was there for a while,

43:11.170 --> 43:20.241
We're generally exporting the creme de la creme of American booksellers, whereas they still, without naming any names, they're certainly exported Englishmen to this country.

43:20.542 --> 43:21.343
Don't print this.

43:21.423 --> 43:22.424
I recorded this here.

43:22.644 --> 43:23.105
Don't print it.

43:23.125 --> 43:27.811
But this is just a bit of intercultural politics.

43:28.031 --> 43:32.757
That's fine.

43:33.277 --> 43:39.605
Anyway, I feel no bookseller, however contemptible, is actually making more money than he deserves to make.

43:39.625 --> 43:44.311
You can make $19.50 an hour driving a UPS truck, which, of course, is just a driver's license.

43:44.331 --> 43:46.554
So who am I to say unkind things?

43:46.574 --> 43:47.655
But they're posers.

43:47.735 --> 43:48.596
I guess that's what I just said.

43:48.616 --> 43:51.460
And, of course, in those volumes of Claire Hughes, that's what I'm attacking.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.964
It's not that Stephen Lowenthal is such a total idiot.

43:55.365 --> 43:56.927
It's just that he's a fraud.

43:57.327 --> 43:57.968
And he's a...

43:59.078 --> 44:01.001
I can't print that, you know.

44:01.021 --> 44:01.863
Of course you can't print that.

44:01.883 --> 44:02.484
Well, that's fine.

44:03.285 --> 44:07.031
But I guess what is the impulse for that, to publish that?

44:07.051 --> 44:08.373
To publish my clericies?

44:08.394 --> 44:08.934
Yes.

44:08.954 --> 44:12.681
Oh, well, you see, I'm, you know, I'm like, it's like the emperor's new clothes.

44:12.981 --> 44:13.883
I'm a scourge.

44:13.903 --> 44:14.844
I'm a scourge of other people.

44:14.904 --> 44:22.818
I think, I believe in, I don't believe in, it's not so much insulting people, it's just that I've always, you know the old Greek motto, know they stay out on, know thyself.

44:22.918 --> 44:25.542
Now, I feel that's a very valuable thing for anyone.

44:25.741 --> 44:28.844
To know yourself, you simply don't exist in a vacuum.

44:29.105 --> 44:30.827
You're in relation to lots of other people.

44:31.107 --> 44:34.571
So to know yourself, you have to know your position in relation to others.

44:34.591 --> 44:37.534
Now, you need to take that in a caste system or a class system.

44:37.874 --> 44:40.297
You know, I'm not an aristocrat, therefore I'm nothing.

44:40.437 --> 44:41.398
I don't believe in that.

44:41.699 --> 44:48.346
But when I meet a person and I talk to them, I know just where I stand in relation to them.

44:48.386 --> 44:53.672
I may take a few conversations, or I have to...

44:54.108 --> 44:55.310
read something they've written.

44:55.630 --> 45:07.406
But I have a fairly clear notion, if you ask me about almost any bookseller with whom I have some acquaintance, if you say, where does he rank these booksellers by intellect, rank these booksellers by learning, rank these booksellers by taste, I could do it just like that.

45:07.666 --> 45:10.230
Now, I realize there are not a lot of people who think that way.

45:10.650 --> 45:17.620
To me, here I am, a person who has never promoted himself, published sort of things semi-anonymously.

45:18.361 --> 45:23.187
I won't say where they're printed, but things of mine do appear anonymously,

45:23.386 --> 45:28.351
in certain periodicals.

45:28.732 --> 45:33.256
And, you know, I'm not in the phone book.

45:33.477 --> 45:39.283
You know, no career thing, but I don't sit here thinking, gosh, compared to Jonathan Hill, I'm an absolute nothing.

45:39.843 --> 45:48.953
You know, I know where I stand, and I don't... Too many booksellers simply measure all this in commercial success, and it's not just the money aspect.

45:48.993 --> 45:51.756
It's simply thrilling to them to have a Newton's Principia.

45:52.023 --> 45:58.974
Well, you know, to me, in Principia, if you're actually spending a lot of time investigating the bibliography or if you're a historian of science and you're studying it, fine.

45:59.214 --> 46:01.718
But otherwise, it's just a talismanic object.

46:01.758 --> 46:06.105
And there are many far more interesting small things that have never been written up.

46:06.125 --> 46:15.600
And the booksellers, I chiefly esteem, are those who have taken small thing under-considered... You know, to me, the five... You could print this.

46:15.620 --> 46:19.566
To me, the five greatest booksellers are Oberle and France,

46:19.951 --> 46:25.639
who did a wonderful catalogue of Foulet Malassie, a French publisher.

46:25.839 --> 46:29.884
And, you know, Oberle has a large personality.

46:29.904 --> 46:31.947
And, you know, he's not just interested in books also.

46:32.247 --> 46:39.737
And his thing on Neo-Latin, he's never necessarily taken, he sells, you know, some famous books and such, but he's never taken them from an obvious point of view.

46:40.058 --> 46:46.887
I think John Collins at Mags, John Collins knows natural history books better than anyone around, and yet he's still selling

46:47.255 --> 46:49.297
10, 20-pound books.

46:49.337 --> 46:58.026
I know many accountants don't like this, but John Collins is willing to spend time investigating some minor thing that has no commercial value.

46:58.066 --> 47:03.312
He's also looked at books in, you know, he has a, you know, he's seen books at libraries also.

47:03.332 --> 47:11.741
You know, so many of these booksellers, they act as though merely because you've never handled a Newton Principia commercially that you would have never even seen one.

47:12.141 --> 47:15.625
If you spend time at libraries, the Berkeley Library has a superb collection of books.

47:15.858 --> 47:17.860
Although, again, it's going horribly downhill.

47:18.581 --> 47:26.208
It's put all its good books in store, all its books printed before the last 20 years are in storage, and it's gotten almost useless nowadays.

47:27.569 --> 47:34.656
You know, you can see by going to libraries, and after I graduated, that's why I was wondering about the missing years when you asked me when I graduated, when I started selling books.

47:34.696 --> 47:42.024
For about three years between graduating, I spent all my time looking at all the natural history books at the rare book room in the biology library.

47:42.264 --> 47:43.485
So I've seen, although I've

47:43.786 --> 47:48.033
I've never owned more than a handful of color plate botanical books.

47:48.053 --> 48:03.718
I've actually seen, although not in multiple copies as someone who's been in the business 40 years has, but I probably, for someone who handles, you know, a copy of Curtis's Foreign Landonensis twice in a lifetime, I've seen just as many color plate books as those people have, and yet those people don't

48:04.070 --> 48:07.234
They think the only way you can see those books is to actually sell them.

48:07.254 --> 48:08.014
It's the auction house.

48:08.034 --> 48:09.656
You see the same thing with our commissorship.

48:09.676 --> 48:23.292
There are people who, Francis Haskell, there was an article by him not long ago, where we all know many a collector who will go to, you'll be seen in Bond Street, but would never be seen at the National Gallery.

48:23.512 --> 48:25.234
They're only interested in if it's purchasable.

48:25.254 --> 48:27.036
And I think that's a great problem with many collectors.

48:27.296 --> 48:28.497
They never go to libraries.

48:28.517 --> 48:29.959
They don't know what there is there.

48:30.209 --> 48:34.096
And yet they're only interested in it from what they can buy out of a catalog or see at a book fair.

48:34.296 --> 48:35.678
There are many a bookseller like that.

48:35.718 --> 48:49.382
There are booksellers who specialize, I won't name any names, but there's one who I was disgusted with who specializes in what I consider an extremely narrow field and was completely unaware of a number of standard bibliographies because they're somewhat scarce.

48:49.750 --> 48:55.198
But if you went to any library, any library has those, or a decent research library, has all of those.

48:55.459 --> 48:58.684
You should immediately go and see those things, know what's there.

48:59.725 --> 49:03.171
But no, their curiosity is entirely limited by commercial considerations.

49:03.451 --> 49:05.234
John Collins has never had that at all.

49:05.775 --> 49:06.976
He used to work at Korich.

49:06.996 --> 49:12.325
He did wonderful catalogs when DeBelder was buying all those books because DeBelder supported the department.

49:12.345 --> 49:15.369
They'd go, or Hugh Fattorini, those people would buy the big, expensive books.

49:15.389 --> 49:17.192
So John Collins simply got out his typewriter,

49:17.375 --> 49:27.048
catalogued every, well, of course, used to have huge numbers of old students to distribute things, and their naturalist department had lots of things worth a pound, two pounds, ten pounds, but they'd never gotten around to catalog.

49:27.068 --> 49:29.951
Those catalogues in the late 60s, early 70s are superb.

49:30.212 --> 49:43.990
John Collins was the same way he catalogued all the Signet Library when he moved to Sotheby's, or the Plesch simply got his typewriter and went out, and the rate at which he can catalog intelligently, you know, sort of slapdash offhand commentary is really extraordinary.

49:44.410 --> 49:46.673
Anyway, I've given you overlay, John Collins,

49:47.159 --> 49:49.523
I said five.

49:50.265 --> 49:50.365
Five.

49:50.785 --> 49:55.754
Rowan Gibbs, unknown to almost anyone, Rowan Gibbs is in Wellington, New Zealand.

49:56.977 --> 50:00.423
He is a lapsed classicist like myself.

50:03.228 --> 50:10.180
I think he was going to do a thesis on poor Apollo, who was a sort of fake, well, it's, they're,

50:11.020 --> 50:15.489
There was a Bollingen edition by Boas, edited by Boas, but otherwise Horopalo was irrelevant.

50:15.530 --> 50:18.476
He was very influential on iconography.

50:19.217 --> 50:25.851
At any rate, he is very learned in classics.

50:26.352 --> 50:31.864
He specializes in New Zealand books, collects a lot of New Zealand fiction, sells books again in what I esteem as its place.

50:32.198 --> 50:39.169
sense of the game of, I dislike A. Edward Newton, his book collecting game, but book selling can be viewed as a game.

50:39.189 --> 50:41.994
It's reeling the person in, never cheating them.

50:42.074 --> 50:45.179
Remember when the Rosenbachs would never sell a book to a customer if he was drunk?

50:45.740 --> 50:48.464
Well, my notion is never sell to them by lying to them.

50:48.485 --> 50:57.319
But I, in fact, described in one of my catalogs, cataloging is the art of making a book seem more desirable than it really is without actually lying about it.

50:57.780 --> 50:58.020
And

50:58.237 --> 51:01.121
Many people need to be just positioned just in the right way.

51:01.421 --> 51:04.024
It's a sort of complicity about it.

51:04.044 --> 51:08.350
They know they're being positioned there, yet they're willing to have that done to them.

51:08.370 --> 51:15.219
You notice that from the rare instances when I see news, largely these people started blaring out their radio at 6 in the morning.

51:15.259 --> 51:20.585
I've overheard these news programs where the news reports it and then say, we know this is sort of disinformation.

51:20.966 --> 51:25.792
It's really being distributed by Prince Charles so that he can position himself as the goody-good effect.

51:26.092 --> 51:28.075
So you get this sort of this wonderful...

51:28.595 --> 51:36.985
place where you're making the audience into a critical, if you know this is a forgery, it's different from not knowing it's a forgery.

51:37.005 --> 51:38.647
We can still esteem it as a forgery.

51:38.867 --> 51:41.650
Or wasn't that a British Spanish forgery, Wise's forgery?

51:41.670 --> 51:47.957
They're esteemed and they're still valuable on a completely different level from the original chicanery.

51:48.338 --> 51:54.805
So Rowan Gibbs is a master at positioning a book which no one would have believed had a New Zealand connection.

51:55.122 --> 52:00.248
in a very possibly far-fetched, but he knows New Zealand books extremely well.

52:00.268 --> 52:01.649
He will spend, he's uneconomical.

52:01.669 --> 52:03.792
I guess that's another aspect which I esteem in these people.

52:04.132 --> 52:05.834
It's not merely the five greatest booksellers.

52:05.894 --> 52:13.823
It's those who will cut their own throat a little or will be uneconomically discursive about their books.

52:14.504 --> 52:23.053
And we'll have a long description about a cheap book and a very short description about a very expensive book, which the real money boy,

52:23.590 --> 52:27.376
of the business would never dream of doing because it confuses the rich customer.

52:27.717 --> 52:34.788
The big expensive book is supposed to be in a box with a nice long note and a lot of citations to make it look, and they don't want to believe some little.

52:34.848 --> 52:38.794
And of course those people don't have the learning if they spend all their time reading Printing in the Mind of Man to do anything.

52:38.814 --> 52:40.697
Rowan Gibbs spends an enormous amount of time reading.

52:41.318 --> 52:44.964
He has a wonderful collection, which I think he may have sold, of Swiss Family Robinson.

52:45.445 --> 52:50.593
Again, he's discovered interesting textual peculiarities, but in fact the whole thing has been partially rewritten.

52:50.827 --> 53:02.099
Um, he has, there's a New Zealand National Bibliography, which he, the last five pages of one of his catalogs simply listed addenda and coragenda to the New Zealand National Bibliography, a free gift to the world.

53:02.159 --> 53:08.645
Um, he's, I think, being pillaged by there's going to be a New Zealand, I think, companion to New Zealand literature.

53:08.685 --> 53:11.609
Those people get a back file of his catalogs and just go through.

53:11.649 --> 53:15.973
You can find immense, uh, he will, he did a catalog of, uh,

53:16.983 --> 53:21.911
early printed books where he had a conjectural emendation of Virgil that no one has ever proposed.

53:22.292 --> 53:24.275
To me, that's the kind of bookselling to do.

53:24.295 --> 53:29.964
It requires a lot of intelligence and learning, and it requires a disinterestedness that very few people have.

53:30.264 --> 53:38.738
So I'm now down to overlay John Collins and—well, of course, I have to say Arthur Freeman.

53:39.595 --> 53:42.640
you know, one of the most intelligent and learned booksellers around.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.267
And you wouldn't, I mean, Arthur Freeman is probably my one choice that everyone would agree.

53:46.287 --> 53:49.312
Well, Oberle, I suppose, although Oberle certainly is not.

53:49.352 --> 53:52.557
I mean, there are people who don't respond to that sort of personality.

53:52.598 --> 53:56.184
I don't think Arthur has too many enemies, and I think you get no quarrel.

53:56.204 --> 53:58.007
So I don't need to, good wine needs no bush.

53:58.047 --> 53:59.710
I needn't promote Arthur Freeman.

54:00.571 --> 54:04.438
Um...

54:06.308 --> 54:07.730
Maybe I shouldn't have said five.

54:07.750 --> 54:24.997
I mean, there are a number, I hate to offend many friends, there are a number of sort of good high second string people who are, to me, they're free of the money-grubbing, careerist, I only handle the finest books, the finest manuscripts, or things that have been codified by others.

54:25.418 --> 54:27.962
So have some independence of judgment.

54:33.747 --> 54:37.633
I know after you've left, I will remember I've eliminated someone I really should.

54:37.913 --> 54:42.760
Well, I will say Andrew Jones, again, heard of by no one.

54:42.800 --> 54:57.182
In fact, I don't know that you should publicize these names, but some of these people, they put out rather small numbers of catalogs, and they actually, also, they're all notable for having quite cheap books, and so I'm able to buy a number of things from these people.

54:57.702 --> 55:02.269
Andrew Jones' elapsed history dawn, that's, I think,

55:02.587 --> 55:03.708
or St.

55:03.768 --> 55:14.038
Catherine's in Cambridge, who sells academic history books out north of Oxford.

55:14.058 --> 55:25.028
He's, the quantity of annotation, I mean, he obviously knows academic history backwards, but he's a very opinionated, conservative person.

55:27.250 --> 55:31.834
I like to think I've corrupted at least, I can't claim I've corrupted John Collins,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.926
I think I've certainly corrupted both Andrew Jones and Rowan Gibbs.

55:36.046 --> 55:40.332
Both of them have become more discursive in the last five or ten years, I think.

55:40.973 --> 55:44.078
Perhaps we're, you know, it's foliadeur or something.

55:44.338 --> 55:51.849
Yes, and I've noticed, I would say with Andrew Jones, he has become, of course, I encourage him into becoming more, interestingly, longer annotations.

55:52.410 --> 55:59.661
But I did put out a volume which I, which you would, well, I don't know that I will show it to you, but...

55:59.928 --> 56:02.992
There is a third volume of Clara Hughes, which was never published.

56:04.014 --> 56:05.275
I gave it out this New Year's.

56:05.396 --> 56:13.988
I published it under... It was published anonymously, although since it wasn't ever sold, it was always given by me to friends, so my name does appear on it.

56:14.028 --> 56:14.949
Do you have one?

56:15.129 --> 56:15.770
I have a copy.

56:15.970 --> 56:17.052
I think I have one copy left.

56:17.092 --> 56:20.917
I don't... Perhaps I will allow you to glance at it.

56:21.178 --> 56:25.023
Because it was distributed privately, I was a little more free with my commentary.

56:25.324 --> 56:27.967
It's called Parnasse Erotique des Libraires.

56:27.987 --> 56:29.209
It's nothing about...

56:29.442 --> 56:34.289
You know, it's not always sexual, but the erotic connections of various booksellers.

56:34.309 --> 56:35.571
There's no scandal in it.

56:36.272 --> 56:42.882
Because, again, I live a very retired life, and I don't, you know, these people, there are many, Peter Howard dines once a month with these various other booksellers.

56:42.902 --> 56:44.645
There are ABA meetings there I was going to.

56:45.066 --> 56:49.392
I'm really never, I never wish to have information that I can't print.

56:49.692 --> 57:00.908
So I'm very, it's like Archbishop Waitley who said, never, never, if you tell me, don't tell me afterwards that you want somebody to keep me to keep this information you've just told confidential.

57:01.168 --> 57:02.650
Yeah, exactly.

57:02.671 --> 57:03.351
See, you should have said it.

57:03.612 --> 57:05.054
I'm not saying I follow Waitley.

57:05.334 --> 57:08.899
But one should always say, don't repeat anything and get the person to agree to it.

57:09.140 --> 57:14.187
If you do it afterwards, Waitley was famous for always saying, no, I shall do with that information what I see fit.

57:14.547 --> 57:18.433
But, you know, I don't actually, don't worry about the Haven no more, because I don't really care about

57:18.667 --> 57:20.610
evidence that I can't use.

57:20.630 --> 57:35.572
I am very much in judging people, which I do, admittedly, Peter will tell you, I'm a severe judge of people, but I try to be fair, I try to bend over backwards, let them hang, give them enough rope, my enough rope theory of human relations.

57:36.553 --> 57:42.362
But I always want evidence that's good enough for a courtroom or for myself if I were a hanging judge.

57:42.629 --> 57:45.832
And so I'm not interested in, you know, so-and-so sort of thing, so-and-so.

57:45.852 --> 57:52.319
If you can actually spot a person selling a defective book after you point it out to him, defective, you've got the goods on that person.

57:52.619 --> 58:01.008
And I feel I've never, with all these people that I've come down severely on in those Clarehues, I could certainly give, in fact, the notes are very often much too kind.

58:01.028 --> 58:02.790
I mean, I've got to the where of life.

58:02.830 --> 58:06.093
When the first one came out, Peter said, oh, this is wonderful, I'll buy a hundred copies.

58:06.133 --> 58:09.317
Then talked to his lawyer who said, you can't possibly sell this.

58:09.337 --> 58:12.400
Lou Weinstein could sue you, for instance.

58:13.004 --> 58:20.001
You know, Peter, for instance, when I say Lou Weinstein just loves to write the dollar sign, for him it really puts the icing on pricing.

58:20.422 --> 58:22.366
Peter said, well, you're suggesting two things.

58:22.747 --> 58:27.739
You're saying that Lou Weinstein's books are overpriced, which is true, as Peter said.

58:27.955 --> 58:30.718
And all he cares about is money, which Peter also says is true.

58:30.738 --> 58:32.801
Don't quote this again as Peter having said it.

58:33.261 --> 58:36.505
But, you know, the fact that... Trust me, I don't need a libel to see.

58:36.566 --> 58:37.987
Right, okay, exactly.

58:38.408 --> 58:39.890
I'm a very big target.

58:39.910 --> 58:41.371
You know, Lou Weinstein is a privilege.

58:41.391 --> 58:43.194
You know, I don't dislike Lou Weinstein, at least.

58:43.214 --> 58:45.556
He's a very genial, unpretentious person.

58:45.577 --> 58:50.082
He's selling books to a lot of ignorant people in Southern California, where the intellectual level...

58:50.230 --> 58:53.514
is lower and the money is much higher than it is in the Bay Area.

58:53.975 --> 58:56.638
And, you know, he adapts to the surroundings.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.221
There's always been a lot of hucksters in Los Angeles.

59:00.423 --> 59:01.204
But I don't condemn that.

59:01.244 --> 59:05.609
But Peter's lawyer immediately pointed out to them, Lou Weinstein could sue you for this.

59:05.689 --> 59:11.116
And Rostenberg and Stern, I don't think, could... Oh, actually, again, I think I can influence Rostenberg and Stern.

59:11.136 --> 59:16.643
Rostenberg and Stern, Kevin O'Donnell got it autographed by everyone else.

59:16.977 --> 59:22.603
send it to Rostenberg and Stern, or maybe just to Xerox, to ask them to autograph it.

59:22.623 --> 59:25.727
And they wrote back to him saying they refused to have anything to do with a filthy anonymous label.

59:26.027 --> 59:30.672
This may have indicated to them that some remarks on lesbianism should be made.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.694
Now, I'm not in the least condemning lesbianism.

59:32.714 --> 59:37.019
What I condemn about Rostenberg and Stern is their constant self-promotion.

59:37.039 --> 59:38.801
And it's fingerspits and confused.

59:38.821 --> 59:39.722
Well, they deny it, too, by the way.

59:39.802 --> 59:40.383
Yeah, of course they do.

59:40.423 --> 59:44.487
Yes, but they've only denied it in this latest book, which is post-

59:45.023 --> 59:46.565
my volume.

59:46.585 --> 01:00:05.592
And I think I could perhaps claim credit for their willing denial because no one else has ever, you know, they've got this self-promotion of, well, as Barney Rosenthal says, you know, they're constantly saying, you know, they were, you know, discrimination against Jews and that Thorndike wouldn't give them, pass them for a PhD at Columbia.

01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:07.875
As Barney says, she just didn't know Latin well enough.

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.698
But they've got this mythology.

01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:12.103
If you're a woman, if you're a Jewish, you have this.

01:00:12.143 --> 01:00:14.487
And it's not to deny that women don't have a worse.

01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:15.769
There are hardly any women in the book trade.

01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:17.913
I mean, that's something one could certainly investigate.

01:00:18.174 --> 01:00:20.618
Why are there virtually no female booksellers?

01:00:20.638 --> 01:00:22.081
Why are there virtually no collectors?

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:23.523
Women buy new books.

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:27.130
They don't buy old books.

01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:41.843
Or, you know, again, to get back to Rustenburg and Stuart, it's certainly true that in academic life, including at Columbia, Jews were certainly discouraged, but the sort of professor who was regularly quoted in the 20s and 30s as telling a promising Jewish student who, be it noted, they did not refuse to teach this person.

01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:49.033
They merely gave them the fact that you're going to have a hard time getting a job at a university because they have a quota about hiring Jews.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:58.129
Being simply honest about a person, in retrospect, 50 years later, these people are viewed as sort of trying to dampen... I mean, Rostenberg is a complete charlatan.

01:00:58.169 --> 01:01:02.357
What I dislike essentially about these two women is they're a pair of self-advertisers.

01:01:02.437 --> 01:01:04.320
It's like Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:10.752
They go into a bookshop and they act as though they found something at Courage that Courage didn't know was there.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.722
I'll explain to you later.

01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:16.969
And so it's, look at this, Leona, look at this, and these sleuthing caps they wear.

01:01:16.989 --> 01:01:26.784
I mean, it's completely in this aspect of the ABA, which I despise, making a sort of toy game out of book collecting, as though it isn't serious, as though it doesn't have a scholarly dimension.

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:28.307
They're sleuthing.

01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:29.308
I despise the words.

01:01:29.409 --> 01:01:33.114
I mean, they're our modern representative, A. Edward Newton, who was also an idiot.

01:01:33.135 --> 01:01:38.443
And sort of by the tingling feeling, as though they are the only one, you read their books,

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:46.662
They visited that next-to-last thing that was well-published, collecting old books in the New World or something or other.

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.869
They visited people like Jean.

01:01:48.889 --> 01:01:49.751
They visited E.P.

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.273
Birchman.

01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:53.900
they visited for senior, all these people, do they tell you anything about these people?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.207
I mean, what would we give for an account, you know, a 10-page account of the personality of E.P.

01:01:59.227 --> 01:01:59.768
Goldschmidt?

01:01:59.788 --> 01:02:00.709
You don't get it from these people.

01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:01.671
They've got their big wedger.

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:05.997
They're simply looking at books which they think they know more about than Goldschmidt, and they found them.

01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:09.842
And it's this narcissistic, and the two of them have been bonded together.

01:02:09.862 --> 01:02:12.025
I mean, I think it's been terrible for the two of them.

01:02:12.376 --> 01:02:21.430
That thing in the actual, I haven't read the latest book, but in the review you saw where Stern's father had a heart attack when she announced she'd gone out on a date with a boyfriend.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.796
I mean, these things are just, you throw up your hands.

01:02:25.816 --> 01:02:31.765
The fact is, of course, what I'm telling you about Rosenberg and Stern, it's said in private by absolutely everyone.

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:34.048
Trust me, it's not likely to make it.

01:02:34.169 --> 01:02:35.751
First of all, the outside work.
