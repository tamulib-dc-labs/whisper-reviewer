00:02.883 --> 00:21.060
This is the third tape, I guess the fifth side of the Brodsky series of interviews, and we're talking with Bob Hamblin, who is now going to talk about some manuscript material, and this is the Western Union

00:21.648 --> 00:33.165
Well, I pulled a folder here that has some Faulkner letters, and by chance it has the telegram that Faulkner sent to Sacks Cummings on the occasion of Albert Einstein's death.

00:33.766 --> 00:37.792
This ties in with the story you heard earlier about Faulkner and Einstein.

00:38.553 --> 00:44.322
And the telegram reads, Albert Einstein was one of the wisest of men and one of the gentlest of men.

00:44.382 --> 00:48.067
Who can replace him in either, let alone in both?

00:49.129 --> 00:49.950
Signed, Bill.

00:51.027 --> 00:56.714
And that's dated April 20th, 1955.

00:59.878 --> 01:03.402
This is from a folder of Cummings materials.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.404
There's some handwritten letters here.

01:05.484 --> 01:06.766
You might want to look through a few.

01:06.826 --> 01:12.613
There are probably about 500 Faulkner letters in the collection.

01:16.745 --> 01:17.546
Go ahead, don't mind me.

01:17.566 --> 01:21.892
I'm just taking care of the necessary housekeeping.

01:21.912 --> 01:27.500
A good number of those we've published in the, let's see, I need to double check that.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.745
We published about 500 letters in volume two.

01:31.025 --> 01:33.348
I think 125 of those were by Faulkner.

01:34.290 --> 01:34.830
I think L.D.

01:34.911 --> 01:42.421
estimates now there may be as many as 1,000 letters in the collection, and more than 200 of those are by Faulkner.

01:42.441 --> 01:43.262
I just found it in my bag.

01:43.362 --> 01:45.165
Do you like the English peppermints?

01:46.698 --> 01:50.365
They're strong.

01:50.766 --> 01:51.227
Thank you.

01:55.134 --> 01:55.955
So we have letters.

01:56.797 --> 02:02.468
I've pulled some manuscript material here.

02:02.488 --> 02:08.419
One of my favorite manuscripts is Sepulcher South, an autobiographical essay that Faustman wrote.

02:10.593 --> 02:24.547
And it starts out as a typescript, but then he was away from his typewriter, apparently, and on page four, he shifts to longhand, and then he continues the essay in longhand.

02:25.108 --> 02:26.649
And there are a couple of versions.

02:26.950 --> 02:30.573
Yes, indeed.

02:30.593 --> 02:32.255
You could just tell me what I'm looking at.

02:32.275 --> 02:35.098
This is an essay...

02:37.677 --> 02:39.479
I'm trying to think of the famous photographer.

02:39.820 --> 02:44.225
There was a photograph of a cemetery in Walker Evans.

02:45.086 --> 02:50.793
And Faulkner had been shown this photograph of a Walker Evans view of a cemetery.

02:50.913 --> 02:56.059
And maybe it was Cummins or someone at Random House said, why don't you write an essay about this photograph?

02:56.820 --> 02:59.203
And the photograph, which was of St.

02:59.223 --> 03:02.487
Peter's Cemetery in Oxford,

03:03.040 --> 03:13.274
It brought back all of Faulkner's memories about the death of his grandfather and others in the family, the times he had gone to the cemetery, and this is a very fine essay.

03:14.335 --> 03:15.397
What did he title the essay?

03:15.417 --> 03:16.919
It's called Sepulchre South.

03:18.120 --> 03:18.761
S-E-P.

03:20.423 --> 03:23.728
He spells it S-E-P-U-L-C-H-U-R-E.

03:25.650 --> 03:26.031
South.

03:27.473 --> 03:27.613
Mm-hmm.

03:28.201 --> 03:32.966
I think it was published with the T-U-R-E spelling, but... Where was it published?

03:33.307 --> 03:40.514
It was... It's been collected in the uncollected stories.

03:40.634 --> 03:47.342
It was published before that in... Maybe in Harper's.

03:47.382 --> 03:47.982
That's okay.

03:48.143 --> 03:56.271
No problem.

03:56.291 --> 03:56.892
S-Light.

03:57.412 --> 03:58.713
In and by.

03:58.813 --> 04:02.797
In and by, that's his slash, in and by gaslight.

04:03.898 --> 04:09.103
But they dropped the subtitle when they published it.

04:09.123 --> 04:13.708
Which is kind of a neat thing to have, isn't it?

04:13.728 --> 04:14.128
Right, right, right.

04:14.148 --> 04:15.730
Separate your cell, 1101.

04:15.750 --> 04:16.430
Help yourself to them.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.872
Do you like these mints, by the way?

04:17.892 --> 04:18.232
Yes, indeed.

04:18.252 --> 04:18.552
You're good.

04:18.572 --> 04:21.835
Help yourself to them.

04:21.855 --> 04:23.537
My wife gets these for me by the crate.

04:28.090 --> 04:39.160
That was published in Harper's Bazaar, December 1954, and then later collected in Blotner's edition of Uncollected Stories, Sepulchre South.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.041
What was the date on again?

04:40.561 --> 04:41.342
December 1954.

04:43.524 --> 04:45.606
And how do they spell it in there?

04:45.886 --> 04:47.868
S-E-P-U-L-T-U-R-E.

04:47.928 --> 04:51.972
Which is interesting.

04:52.152 --> 04:53.413
I wonder why they changed this from here.

04:53.433 --> 04:57.977
Right.

04:57.997 --> 04:58.097
Nice.

04:58.887 --> 05:15.011
Another set of manuscripts in the collection is Requiem for a Nun, the play slash novel that Faulkner wrote for Ruth Ford.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.138
And some of these, these are really the outtakes.

05:19.198 --> 05:20.800
These were at Sacks Cummins' house.

05:21.361 --> 05:26.008
Eldie acquired them from Cummins and from Dorothy.

05:27.541 --> 05:32.786
I asked Ruth Ford once to account for the VIEW letterhead stationery.

05:32.846 --> 05:41.996
Her brother, Charles Henry Ford, was editor of VIEW magazine, and Ruth didn't know how far from it came by this letterhead, probably at her apartment when he was there visiting.

05:42.016 --> 05:45.759
He just picked up some sheets of it and may have even done some writing while he was there.

05:46.100 --> 05:52.266
But he turned over the backside of the letterhead stationery and he wrote,

05:52.752 --> 05:57.417
And these were the sections that were later revised, and so these would be outtakes.

05:58.078 --> 06:00.040
We've studied this and published the materials.

06:00.881 --> 06:05.887
I think there are portions of five different scenes here from the play or novel.

06:07.188 --> 06:08.970
Which were never incorporated?

06:09.831 --> 06:13.215
Most of them were, but in greatly revised form.

06:14.356 --> 06:22.185
When you say outtakes, it's essentially material that he reworked, and then he laid these pages aside as he reworked them.

06:22.672 --> 06:26.516
for the further version.

06:26.536 --> 06:30.079
And some of this is typed.

06:30.099 --> 06:39.908
Much of it is in longhand, different colors of ink, different... Some of the handwriting is fairly easy to read, fairly meticulous.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.630
Other is quite sloppy.

06:41.650 --> 06:44.753
It looks like he sat on his knee and wrote it.

06:45.914 --> 06:47.796
But it's significant.

06:47.816 --> 06:52.560
And he also had a lot of cut and paste that he did where he would just

06:53.063 --> 06:58.391
sometimes clip out a passage and move it to another section of the manuscript.

06:59.173 --> 07:05.202
Not having a word processor, he'd just use scissors and glue and move material from one place to another.

07:06.685 --> 07:09.509
So there's a good bit of Requiem material here.

07:09.689 --> 07:11.672
There's similar pages from a fable.

07:13.155 --> 07:20.286
I guess I didn't pull those, but it's also material that he rejected, and he left a lot of that at Sacks Cummings' house in Princeton.

07:20.890 --> 07:25.817
and Brodsky acquired it from Dorothy Cummings, the widow.

07:25.837 --> 07:32.006
I think Brodsky's favorite manuscript, in fact, I'm positive of that, is this wash.

07:32.126 --> 07:34.810
This is the folder that Faulkner kept it in.

07:36.072 --> 07:41.680
This came from, at one time, this was at Rowanoak, Faulkner's home.

07:41.700 --> 07:50.593
Like many of the materials in the collection, various people were given things by Faulkner or Estelle, and then after Faulkner's death,

07:50.860 --> 07:56.766
different relatives went in and probably took things so they'd have something from Faulkner.

07:56.786 --> 08:02.471
And so this is a manuscript of one of Faulkner's best short stories called Wash.

08:02.491 --> 08:06.535
It was later incorporated into Absalom Absalom as a part of the novel, a chapter.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.338
There's an early version.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.760
Yeah, I think I have to handle this.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.364
Yeah, this is the choice manuscript in the collection.

08:15.744 --> 08:19.768
Wash, W-A-S-H, isn't it?

08:19.788 --> 08:19.888
Okay.

08:21.725 --> 08:22.826
This is pretty nice.

08:22.846 --> 08:24.368
Now, have you had this treated at all?

08:24.568 --> 08:25.129
No, no.

08:25.149 --> 08:28.112
Do you think you want to stop that foxing, actually?

08:28.132 --> 08:28.272
Right.

08:28.292 --> 08:31.075
Yeah, there's a lot of that material, a lot of that work that has to be done, right?

08:31.095 --> 08:31.235
Mm-hmm.

08:33.257 --> 08:34.358
Do you have it on both sides?

08:34.378 --> 08:34.498
No.

08:34.578 --> 08:36.721
Not in this one, he didn't.

08:36.741 --> 08:39.544
And this one has the... The paper clip?

08:40.465 --> 08:42.166
Pages, they're numbered.

08:42.227 --> 08:43.928
There's another version of that.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.791
There's the rest of the paper clip.

08:46.811 --> 08:49.334
See, this one has the two over one.

08:50.255 --> 08:50.635
Mm-hmm.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.276
These are...

08:52.488 --> 08:54.390
Now this stuff that's crossed out, is that rejected?

08:55.130 --> 08:58.714
That's the manuscript in progress as he went along.

08:59.254 --> 09:02.617
But I mean, that's material that didn't make it into the... That's right.

09:02.717 --> 09:08.803
In fact, none of this in this version made it up to the... You see, this is an early version.

09:08.863 --> 09:10.725
This is an updated version.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.228
Then he moved up to the typescript.

09:14.508 --> 09:15.709
So he kept all his variants.

09:15.769 --> 09:16.230
That's right.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.771
You have three variants here.

09:18.111 --> 09:19.913
And you finally got to the typescript.

09:21.277 --> 09:23.660
This is Faulkner's typing, I'm pretty sure.

09:26.204 --> 09:29.389
But none of these is the published version.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.111
He continued to revise.

09:31.131 --> 09:34.476
Faulkner revised right up through Galley.

09:35.257 --> 09:39.063
And when he'd send the galleys back, he was still making revisions and so on.

09:39.083 --> 09:46.153
That's why some of the so-called corrected editions of Faulkner's works that are being issued now, some of those are really quite questionable because

09:46.842 --> 09:52.968
If you don't have all the variants and all the processes, the phases, you can't go back to Faulkner's manuscript.

09:52.988 --> 09:53.849
And know which is which.

09:54.029 --> 09:54.530
That's right.

09:54.950 --> 09:55.291
That's right.

09:55.311 --> 09:59.415
And so when you start tampering with... There's nothing here to indicate this is the first draft or the second draft.

09:59.635 --> 10:00.135
No.

10:00.175 --> 10:01.757
In fact, that's an advanced draft.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.080
We know that's farther along than this one.

10:05.961 --> 10:13.068
And, of course, the typescript would presumably be farther along than this, and yet he continued to revise, and the published version is different from even the typescript.

10:13.088 --> 10:15.651
Now, this is closer to the published version than this.

10:16.424 --> 10:19.628
The published story has an altogether different opening, different beginning.

10:20.650 --> 10:24.014
And so what you have here is an intermediate version of the short story.

10:24.174 --> 10:25.796
Has this all been copied, I hope?

10:25.816 --> 10:28.460
Yeah, and we published this now.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.221
We have.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.924
We transcribed it and published it in this.

10:32.325 --> 10:33.887
Where has it been published?

10:33.907 --> 10:35.089
In our volume five.

10:36.651 --> 10:37.512
Or one place.

10:37.752 --> 10:38.673
The Mississippi books?

10:38.994 --> 10:39.695
Right, right.

10:41.717 --> 10:45.182
Many of these manuscripts that you're seeing have been published now in our...

10:45.803 --> 10:48.587
in our volumes.

10:48.607 --> 10:54.316
That takes nothing away from the archival quality of the materials.

10:55.117 --> 11:03.570
I don't think so, and with Faulkner reading his handwriting, there's a lot of guesswork involved, and so there's always the challenge of another scholar coming along and redoing it, rechecking your work.

11:03.610 --> 11:06.114
You're never, it's never final.

11:06.614 --> 11:09.599
There's no definitive version of Faulkner's handwriting.

11:09.619 --> 11:12.283
I mean, transcribing it because somebody else looks at it

11:12.770 --> 11:19.377
We try to be very meticulous about if we say illegible or we put a question mark if it's hard to read.

11:20.157 --> 11:24.782
But there's a real challenge in reading his handwritten manuscripts.

11:24.802 --> 11:27.284
Have you had many scholars come to use the materials?

11:27.324 --> 11:27.785
We're getting.

11:29.006 --> 11:31.689
Blopner has used the materials for his revised biography.

11:32.429 --> 11:35.152
Oates used a good many of the materials for his biography.

11:35.332 --> 11:37.635
He actually thanked L.D.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.115
Carl.

11:38.716 --> 11:40.077
Carl used his.

11:40.580 --> 11:44.546
Joel Williamson, the historian from Chapel Hill, was here for three weeks this summer.

11:45.407 --> 11:46.889
He's doing a book on Faulkner and race.

11:47.009 --> 11:48.091
He spent three weeks here.

11:48.632 --> 11:52.037
A month ago, we had a lady from Amsterdam who was here for a week.

11:53.118 --> 11:55.782
She's doing her doctoral dissertation at the University of Amsterdam.

11:55.962 --> 12:01.631
I've sent materials to Tokyo, Paris, that is copies, photographs.

12:02.372 --> 12:03.453
No, Xerox copies.

12:05.196 --> 12:10.063
Next week, I'm mailing to Gallimore, the French publisher, about 20...

12:10.330 --> 12:12.792
photographs from the collection, reproductions.

12:12.832 --> 12:18.377
They were doing a pictorial biography of Faulkner, and they wanted about 20 of the photographs from materials here.

12:18.417 --> 12:28.606
Once we establish the Faulkner Center, we will be able to, right now it's on a kind of a one-by-one basis.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.908
And there would be no Faulkner Center if you didn't have the Brodsky Collection?

12:31.928 --> 12:33.230
No, no, no.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.652
The Brodsky Collection is the Faulkner Center.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.595
But I mean, obviously you're, for instance, looking for some

12:40.165 --> 12:40.946
Any H money?

12:41.046 --> 12:42.588
We've applied for a federal grant.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.972
We've also applied for foundation support.

12:48.756 --> 12:58.749
But even if we don't get the outside funding, we will begin renovation next door this summer to create a meeting room, office space, exhibit area.

12:58.769 --> 13:02.053
We've got to decide if we want a door here to go into the center.

13:02.674 --> 13:04.576
That might lessen security a little bit.

13:04.596 --> 13:05.557
We may choose not to go.

13:05.597 --> 13:06.919
And we lose some shelf space.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.003
We may just go out the door here and down the hall and

13:10.388 --> 13:13.092
But there's a little theater right there, and I see it's 200 people.

13:13.332 --> 13:14.494
It's a lecture hall.

13:15.035 --> 13:18.039
And we will take that space and renovate it into the Faulkner Center.

13:18.941 --> 13:28.535
And then once we have secretarial help and staff and we get all this file in a way and have it copied, so we could have working copies.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.919
Most scholars would not use the originals.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.481
We'd use Xerox copies.

13:32.933 --> 13:38.582
But we'll have the facility set up so that students and scholars can use the materials.

13:38.862 --> 13:39.824
It's exciting, isn't it?

13:39.884 --> 13:40.404
It really is.

13:40.585 --> 13:51.742
And to me, that's sort of the culmination of the work, to see it evolve into a research center where people can come.

13:51.922 --> 13:55.107
And we've let people do that for the last five years or so.

13:55.187 --> 13:59.734
That is, use the collection, but it's always had to be on an individual basis.

14:00.457 --> 14:07.168
We've had some graduate students occasionally use certain materials in the collection and some of the scholars that I mentioned.

14:07.188 --> 14:19.307
We had a school teacher from New Hampshire who had a summer independent study from the National Endowment for the Humanities dealing with Faulkner in Hollywood and he came and spent about a week here and used the film script material.

14:21.992 --> 14:25.317
The opportunities for scholarly use

14:26.140 --> 14:29.425
Which, again, is part of the excitement for L.D.

14:29.445 --> 14:31.067
He's moved beyond collecting now.

14:31.688 --> 14:44.227
I would say he moved from collecting to publishing, and now the next phase is creating the Faulkner Center, the research center, and opening it up for other people to use the collection.

14:44.287 --> 14:47.031
See, for the past ten years I've been the luckiest scholar in America.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.133
Where is that?

14:48.153 --> 14:50.376
Because I've had almost a monopoly.

14:51.166 --> 14:59.137
working with LD, and this is, you know, we've been the only two people by and large in this room using these materials for five years.

14:59.578 --> 15:00.880
He moved the materials here in 84.

15:03.223 --> 15:06.929
And there's a little story I need to tell you about his looking at this room and all, too.

15:07.469 --> 15:12.276
But we deposited the materials here in 84, though it remained in private ownership.

15:12.437 --> 15:14.119
We just warehoused the materials for him.

15:15.196 --> 15:16.517
And it made it easy.

15:16.617 --> 15:20.020
For the first five years that I knew him, I drove back and forth to Farmington and St.

15:20.060 --> 15:20.380
Louis.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.304
I commuted about once a week to use the materials there.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.285
And that was quite a hassle.

15:26.305 --> 15:28.888
We did the first two or three books in that fashion.

15:29.768 --> 15:30.469
This room was here.

15:30.509 --> 15:31.630
It wasn't being used for anything.

15:31.670 --> 15:32.791
It had all the empty shelves.

15:32.871 --> 15:33.652
And one day, L.D.

15:33.672 --> 15:34.713
was in here looking around.

15:34.773 --> 15:36.154
And he said, boy, what a great room.

15:36.214 --> 15:39.857
And I need something like this, he said, for the collection.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.338
And I said, you know, here it is.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.781
If you want to use it, we could arrange if you just want to store the materials here.

15:45.419 --> 15:49.584
And so since 84, this is where we've done much of our work.

15:49.604 --> 15:52.688
And yet, by and large, it's been him and me.

15:53.289 --> 15:55.512
And other scholars have not had access to the material.

15:55.532 --> 16:01.480
And so I've been very privileged, as I say, to have something almost like a monopoly on the material.

16:01.740 --> 16:05.966
That's changing now as we create the center and make it available to other scholars.

16:06.246 --> 16:09.450
Do you have a favorite among the majors?

16:10.191 --> 16:14.076
The sepulcher I just showed you, I think, is my favorite of the

16:14.528 --> 16:16.070
the stories or essays.

16:17.913 --> 16:22.000
There are some cartoons, some yearbook cartoons that Faulkner did.

16:22.020 --> 16:30.032
They didn't have enough money to complete the yearbook.

16:30.052 --> 16:31.655
He was a 16-year-old high school student.

16:31.675 --> 16:32.676
Yeah, in 1913.

16:33.778 --> 16:38.685
And he did some cartoon drawings for the yearbook, which was never published, never printed.

16:38.826 --> 16:42.932
And then he gave these cartoons to a high school classmate, maybe a sweetheart.

16:43.452 --> 16:45.574
Her name was Myrtle Ramey.

16:45.594 --> 16:52.861
There were 10 of these cartoons, and my favorite was the one, the Lincoln caricature.

16:53.742 --> 17:02.030
This is Miss Ella Wright, Faulkner's history teacher at Oxford High School, at Oxford Graded School, it was called.

17:02.510 --> 17:10.658
Here's Faulkner's signature without the U. Miss Ella Wright is grinding out demerits to this villain, Lincoln,

17:11.195 --> 17:17.322
At his feet in miniature, you have the big Yankee bully armed with a knife picking on that little unarmed Confederate.

17:18.002 --> 17:22.447
And the history teacher, this is the way she taught history from a Confederate point of view.

17:22.487 --> 17:25.050
The caption says, them's my sentiments.

17:25.070 --> 17:25.390
Wow.

17:25.471 --> 17:28.634
Now, those were probably Faulkner's sentiments, too, you see, in 1913.

17:28.694 --> 17:33.840
But by the 1940s, he was moving toward integration.

17:33.860 --> 17:35.241
I'm just describing it.

17:35.361 --> 17:36.983
Lincoln almost looks like an ape.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.523
I mean, he has some simian qualities to it.

17:39.543 --> 17:44.047
Now, Blotner, in his first edition, he had seen these before the days of Xerox.

17:44.087 --> 17:49.953
He saw them when Murder Ramey had them, and Blotner calls that a likeness of Abraham Lincoln.

17:49.973 --> 17:51.215
Wow.

17:51.235 --> 17:52.196
He missed it.

17:52.216 --> 17:52.676
He missed it.

17:52.696 --> 17:56.820
The caricature and the criticism of Lincoln as the villain.

17:56.840 --> 18:05.169
We have a Yankee with a knife, and we have a rib much smaller, and them, T-H-E-M apostrophe S, them's my sentiments.

18:05.489 --> 18:05.569
Yes.

18:05.819 --> 18:17.151
W. Falker, the F-A-L-K, and we're looking at the... I'll tell you, he and I have written across three years.

18:19.514 --> 18:29.405
Now, as a, shall I say, liberated Southerner myself, you know, when Dr. King said, free at last, thank God Almighty we're free, he meant whites, too.

18:29.425 --> 18:31.507
I mean, we miss that point sometimes.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.970
He freed the white Southerner from prejudice, you know, and so...

18:34.473 --> 18:40.019
I consider myself a kind of liberated southerner, and it's interesting to me to see how Faulkner made that progress.

18:40.920 --> 18:45.365
Faulkner's early—there is some racism, if you want to call it that, in Faulkner's early work.

18:45.545 --> 18:50.090
That is, his views of blacks are stereotypical, but he grew out of that.

18:50.871 --> 18:51.732
Stone never did.

18:52.954 --> 19:02.404
Stone remained a racist all of his life and quit talking to Faulkner, but this measures how far Faulkner had to come to get to be an integrationist in the 1950s.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.046
Robert, where did I go with that coffee cup?

19:05.066 --> 19:05.767
I see it.

19:05.787 --> 19:13.934
I hid it there because they were photographing the other day, and they didn't want the coffee cup in the... I think there's a nice, gritty commensal there, if you'd like to find out.

19:13.954 --> 19:14.295
Thanks.

19:14.475 --> 19:15.376
I found my tender.

19:15.416 --> 19:17.458
I was looking for them this morning.

19:17.478 --> 19:18.298
Did that thing go in?

19:18.318 --> 19:19.580
You know, that needs to be in a folder.

19:19.940 --> 19:21.221
Those darn things, they did it.

19:21.241 --> 19:21.942
I'm sure it did.

19:21.962 --> 19:22.262
They what?

19:22.322 --> 19:22.623
Yeah.

19:23.103 --> 19:25.265
Those things need to get in a folder.

19:25.285 --> 19:27.427
You know, in their own... Yeah, I mean, in their own glassine.

19:27.527 --> 19:28.528
That's part of the work.

19:28.628 --> 19:32.712
I was just talking with Bob Foster, and I told him, uh, I met Caleb.

19:33.097 --> 19:33.578
Oh, did you?

19:33.718 --> 19:34.980
Yeah, nice.

19:36.021 --> 19:37.584
She was real keen on our work.

19:38.465 --> 19:39.146
I'll be right back.

19:41.029 --> 19:43.353
Don't forget he was just a kid of 16 here, too.

19:43.373 --> 19:45.396
I mean, we're talking about a child.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.297
This is juvenile.

19:46.317 --> 19:48.120
That's right.

19:48.160 --> 19:48.621
When L.D.

19:48.681 --> 19:50.384
found these, they were in the daughter.

19:50.504 --> 19:56.573
By that time, Myrtle Ramey was in a rest home, and her daughter had these materials, and he went there to get some inscribed books.

19:57.228 --> 20:00.513
And she said, well, if you want to look through that box, I think there's some other materials there.

20:00.553 --> 20:11.389
And so he literally rescued these things from probably the garbage dump because the woman who had them didn't understand the importance of the juvenilia.

20:11.749 --> 20:14.293
She knew the books were significant.

20:14.313 --> 20:14.894
And L.D.

20:15.014 --> 20:20.962
brought back both three or four books signed by Faulkner to Myrtle Ramey, but he also brought back these ten cartoons.

20:21.143 --> 20:22.845
Where did he get these from again?

20:22.865 --> 20:24.147
The Daughter of Myrtle Ramey.

20:24.397 --> 20:27.321
M-Y-R-T-L-E, Ramey, R-A-M-E-Y.

20:28.302 --> 20:34.390
And by that time she was Demarest, D-E-M-A-R-E-S-T, her married name.

20:35.091 --> 20:40.578
But she had been Myrtle Ramey, a classmate of Faulkner at the Oxford graded school, and maybe his sweetheart.

20:41.860 --> 20:45.805
And he gave her these cartoons when they weren't used in the yearbook.

20:45.885 --> 20:47.026
And then years later, L.D.

20:47.086 --> 20:50.691
acquired them from the daughter, who really didn't know what she had.

20:51.042 --> 20:59.573
And for a scholar to look at that cartoon and all that it says about Faulkner's attitude, the world he grew up in, I mean, that's what excites me.

20:59.673 --> 21:03.137
That's much more exciting than three inscribed books to me.

21:03.958 --> 21:08.283
That cartoon, for the scholar, is worth more than three inscribed books.

21:08.303 --> 21:08.984
Can I take a picture of it?

21:09.064 --> 21:09.385
Do you mind?

21:09.405 --> 21:09.525
Sure.

21:11.387 --> 21:13.109
I'm trying to draw a facsimile there.

21:13.190 --> 21:13.870
It's kind of funny.

21:14.551 --> 21:20.779
I mean, I have no idea.

21:28.606 --> 21:31.690
You don't have any idea how they... He pulled out his favorite.

21:31.710 --> 21:35.154
Yeah, he asked me what was my favorite, and I went for the Sepulcher South.

21:35.174 --> 21:36.636
That's only because he's a Southerner.

21:36.776 --> 21:38.018
Oh, that's right.

21:38.038 --> 21:38.739
That's right.

21:38.759 --> 21:41.903
Well, in Sepulcher South, the manuscript.

21:41.923 --> 21:42.163
Oh, yeah.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.125
Oh, and you know my little favorite manuscript?

21:44.225 --> 21:47.830
I love that damn introduction to the Faulkner Reader.

21:48.010 --> 21:48.531
Yeah.

21:48.551 --> 21:53.056
About his grandfather's Catholic library, where he talks about it being a vegetable.

21:53.117 --> 21:56.681
Did you show... You tell him about De Gaulle, because that's the manuscript of De Gaulle.

21:56.701 --> 21:58.343
Did you show Nick those...

21:58.880 --> 22:00.422
wash manuscripts?

22:00.502 --> 22:01.063
Yeah, we do.

22:01.263 --> 22:01.964
Oh, we did wash.

22:01.984 --> 22:02.765
We did separate yourself.

22:02.825 --> 22:03.126
Mind blower.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.828
We've done the cartoons.

22:04.848 --> 22:07.011
I tell you what, that came out of Faulkner's home.

22:07.031 --> 22:07.411
Really?

22:08.392 --> 22:09.814
Those were wonderful.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.937
I don't want to get into that one.

22:12.077 --> 22:13.018
I want to stay with you.

22:13.819 --> 22:25.815
That's another part of it, too, that if you work like I worked, some things surface that are surreptitious, and they remain surreptitious for good reasons, but that's true with anything.

22:26.335 --> 22:29.478
And it isn't that I have indulged in criminal activities.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.200
It's just that if you want to make an anomaly, you have to break eggs.

22:32.701 --> 22:35.323
Well, see, I was in Oxford when Faulkner died.

22:35.443 --> 22:38.186
I was in Oxford, and there was nobody in the home.

22:40.428 --> 22:46.614
Miss Dorothy Oldham was a sort of caretaker of the sister-in-law, and relatives had access to the home.

22:46.714 --> 22:55.802
And what happened, I think, I mean, everybody, when somebody dies, people take things or divide them up, or relatives.

22:55.917 --> 22:56.819
And who can say?

22:56.899 --> 22:58.884
I mean, maybe they were given to them by Faulkner or Estelle.

22:58.904 --> 23:08.167
I'm going to read you a... But in some cases, I think people just went into Rowanoak, relatives, you know, who had access to the building, and they just took something to have a souvenir.

23:08.187 --> 23:12.778
And then later, 20 years later... The way people grab stuff out of Shakespeare's house, you know, I mean...

23:13.433 --> 23:18.260
Let me tell you this story.

23:18.480 --> 23:28.255
When Faulkner's library at Rowanoak was just out there open and they didn't have the rooms closed off or anything and they'd have the 200 people in the house and Faulkner's personal library was just there on the shelf.

23:29.056 --> 23:36.247
And I wrote Jim Webb one time and asked him to check an inscription in a Faulkner book because Blotner had recorded it and it didn't make sense.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.471
It was either an advanced review copy or Blotner had miscopied the date.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.314
So I wrote Ole Miss and asked Jim Webb to

23:41.648 --> 23:45.994
to check on the inscription the next time he was out at Rowanoak, and when he went out, he said, the book's not there.

23:46.935 --> 23:52.202
And he said, maybe Jill took it, as we suspect, but anybody could have taken it.

23:52.383 --> 24:02.456
In those days, you could go into Rowanoak, and they weren't very careful about... Talk to Mr. Nick about a little story that fits in with that one.

24:02.837 --> 24:05.040
Oh, yes, that's one I have.

24:05.510 --> 24:30.797
Every year at the Faulkner Conference, Evans Harrington, who is the director of the annual Faulkner Conference, leads people on the tour, and they go out to Faulkner's farm, and there's a little lodge out there where Faulkner did some writing and had some books, and Evans always tells this story every year.

24:30.817 --> 24:34.521
He says, when I came out here in the 1950s, there were

24:34.889 --> 24:39.115
three modern library editions.

24:39.376 --> 24:43.722
He said, I remember there were two Hardy novels, and he said, Green Mansions was another.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.585
And he said, they were here on the shelf.

24:45.605 --> 24:46.987
I'm holding Green Mansions in my right hand.

24:47.127 --> 24:50.552
And he said, then I came back a few years later, and the books were gone.

24:50.612 --> 24:52.094
And he said, I don't know where they are.

24:52.215 --> 24:57.062
And I told Evans one time, I said, I'll tell you where the books are.

24:57.182 --> 24:59.826
I don't, you know, they're in the Brodsky collection.

24:59.866 --> 25:04.052
But these books were out at Faulkner's Lodge at Greenfield Farm.

25:04.555 --> 25:07.498
I'll tell you the rest of the story.

25:07.518 --> 25:08.439
You tell the rest of the story.

25:08.459 --> 25:21.672
What I'm holding, I just want for the record, I'm holding three small modern library editions of Faulkner's own signed copies of Green Mansions, Jude the Obscure, and Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.554
Faulkner's personal reading copies.

25:23.574 --> 25:24.995
Now, Faulkner's personal.

25:25.556 --> 25:27.258
From whom did I get them?

25:27.278 --> 25:29.440
I got them from Jim Silver.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.522
The history professor.

25:31.542 --> 25:34.545
Jim Silver had these three books because he got them at the farm.

25:35.048 --> 25:38.491
Jim Silver told me that Estelle told him that he could have them.

25:39.652 --> 25:44.096
I'm going to leave it like that, and you're not going to mess with that in that transcription.

25:44.116 --> 25:48.480
Let's just say that occasionally there are things that we call creative provenance.

25:48.500 --> 25:52.003
Listen, I'm going to shut this out just for a second.

25:53.345 --> 25:58.269
Let me tell you a coda to these three books and to their provenance.

25:58.289 --> 26:04.735
These books are not only significant because they funnel into the other books in this collection that I told you were actually

26:04.883 --> 26:06.525
Faulkner's own personal copies.

26:06.966 --> 26:11.112
These were his three, these were three of his favorite copies that he returned to quite often.

26:11.433 --> 26:16.561
How favorite was Green Mansions in the story, The Bruch, am I not correct?

26:17.101 --> 26:22.630
The character is sitting there in the chair reading his Modern Library copy of Green Mansions.

26:23.491 --> 26:30.081
Now that story was written about the same time that William Faulkner's copy of the Modern Library was dated, Rowanoak 1931.

26:30.567 --> 26:38.755
You see, he was installing his own library in his new home, which he just moved into in 1930, in either April or June, I don't remember.

26:39.436 --> 26:41.698
But here was Faulkner signing the books he loved.

26:42.319 --> 26:44.020
And here were these wonderful three books.

26:44.080 --> 26:48.325
And when I got these from Jim, they weren't really expensive.

26:48.345 --> 26:51.007
They were like, and he said, you set a price.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.551
And I think I paid him like $500 a piece for these books.

26:54.731 --> 26:55.652
You were being very fair.

26:55.992 --> 26:57.674
I was, too, because he was thrilled.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.916
Because a lot of people might think, wow.

27:00.217 --> 27:02.100
You know what they cost him?

27:02.180 --> 27:05.506
All it is is an autograph on a book that he didn't write, you know?

27:05.726 --> 27:06.347
Well, that's right.

27:06.848 --> 27:07.829
What they cost him.

27:08.891 --> 27:09.292
That's right.

27:09.312 --> 27:11.235
This is from Found Money, in other words.

27:11.295 --> 27:14.961
Yeah, absolutely.

27:15.562 --> 27:16.363
Let me read you.

27:18.046 --> 27:19.108
Found Money is right.

27:19.188 --> 27:20.510
Plenty of it he found for me.

27:22.553 --> 27:25.498
He had one item that Malcolm Franklin gave him.

27:26.035 --> 27:55.215
that I have not put it's the only item I didn't put of all of the things and it sits on my desk it sits beside my typewriter and every morning when I work I wind it up it's a pocket bend West Clocks pocket bend with a little black face and little iridescent numerals and hands and on the back of it with a nail he had inscribed W. Faulkner Ring Dove it had been the watch the pocket watch that he kept in the binnacle on his sailboat

27:55.482 --> 27:57.685
the ring dove on Sardis Reservoir.

27:58.366 --> 27:59.087
And I love it.

27:59.307 --> 28:01.290
And my press is called Timeless Press.

28:02.191 --> 28:09.421
And in The Sound and the Fury, when I told you I first attached to Faulkner, I attached to Faulkner through Quentin Compson.

28:09.441 --> 28:11.884
And Quentin was absolutely obsessed with time.

28:12.786 --> 28:15.329
And he had his grandfather's watch, was it not?

28:15.349 --> 28:17.933
And it, he broke it finally.

28:17.953 --> 28:18.694
It had no hands.

28:21.317 --> 28:22.959
Anyway, let me read you one thing.

28:23.000 --> 28:23.380
This is

28:24.035 --> 28:27.159
How do you put a world-class collection like this together?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.783
You do it with the help of an awful lot of people.

28:30.764 --> 28:34.429
There is no one person like Carl Peterson or like L.D.

28:34.469 --> 28:40.797
Brodsky who, buying from book dealers catalogs, if you did it for 50 years, could put a collection together like this.

28:41.518 --> 28:41.838
Why?

28:42.459 --> 28:52.152
The why is because you need to tap in to all kinds of mini collections that will ultimately create the large collection.

28:52.874 --> 28:54.216
What do I mean by collections?

28:54.456 --> 29:05.293
The people who owned a lot of the artifacts that I went to and acquired the materials from would never have thought of their holdings as a collection, but rather as accumulated things that they'd gotten over the years.

29:05.513 --> 29:07.136
They weren't consciously collecting.

29:07.436 --> 29:11.102
As an example, Phil Stone was not consciously collecting.

29:11.555 --> 29:14.538
gathering and accumulating and saving the artifacts.

29:14.638 --> 29:15.058
And souvenirs.

29:15.339 --> 29:18.802
Souvenirs from years, from 30, 40 year span, actually.

29:18.822 --> 29:19.462
Keepsakes.

29:19.563 --> 29:20.063
Keepsakes.

29:20.123 --> 29:25.148
But you wouldn't, the people who knew Faulkner, for the most part, also knew how profound he was.

29:25.528 --> 29:27.230
And so they didn't throw those keepsakes away.

29:27.830 --> 29:40.262
So I would go to various people and acquire from them, not an item, not two or five items, but each time a trove, an archive, if you will, a collection.

29:41.137 --> 29:43.160
that they had unconsciously collected.

29:43.981 --> 29:54.815
If you take 15 or 20 of those in various degrees of quality and breadth, then you have the beginnings of a massive world-class collection.

29:55.336 --> 29:55.977
That's what's here.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.401
There's Clienth Books here and his gathering.

29:59.421 --> 30:00.262
Malcolm Cowley.

30:01.183 --> 30:01.704
On and on.

30:01.724 --> 30:03.426
I could run on and on the list of that.

30:03.647 --> 30:04.328
Moon Mullen.

30:04.788 --> 30:06.190
I went to travel to find him.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.111
Phil Stone.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.393
Myrtle Ramey.

30:09.115 --> 30:09.796
On and on.

30:09.896 --> 30:12.840
We could, wouldn't stop for quite a while if I ran the list.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.963
Here is a little trove, a little collection.

30:15.003 --> 30:19.650
There was a man at Random House, an editor named Robert Linscott.

30:19.670 --> 30:27.662
He was an underling to contemporary of, but really an underling to Saks Cummins, as was Albert Erskine.

30:27.682 --> 30:29.604
Both of them were minor editors.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.587
Saks was premier editor.

30:32.268 --> 30:33.550
Saks edited C.P.

30:33.570 --> 30:33.911
Snow.

30:34.752 --> 30:37.876
He edited Eugene O'Neill, whose best friend he was.

30:38.457 --> 30:39.038
He edited

30:39.558 --> 30:40.159
Faulkner.

30:40.179 --> 30:41.821
Those were his three premier.

30:42.241 --> 30:47.027
He also edited people like Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Dr. Seuss.

30:49.611 --> 31:06.392
I'll tell you in the car driving home how it is that I acquired the Saks Cummins archive right out from under the Firestone Library, precisely because Dorothy had a lot of resentment toward a lot of people, not the least of whom was a Malcolm Cowley.

31:06.777 --> 31:13.765
who borrowed some of those papers to put in the back of one of those books, the Cowley Faulkner file, the Faulkner-Cowley file.

31:14.546 --> 31:18.410
In the back of that, he prints a manuscript of the American Dream or something on privacy.

31:18.791 --> 31:21.494
He went to Doe to borrow some of the manuscripts.

31:21.954 --> 31:25.538
He virtually didn't credit her at all, said very little about Sacks.

31:25.559 --> 31:32.987
She had a big burn on because Blotner virtually didn't write Sacks Cummins into the biography.

31:33.355 --> 31:34.316
She was real pissed.

31:34.396 --> 31:37.640
There's a beautiful letter Ellie shared with her from Dorothy Cummings.

31:37.780 --> 31:48.852
When our letters volume came out, which had a lot of the Sacks Cummings letters, and in our introduction, we treated how crucial Cummings was to partner's career, especially the last part of it.

31:49.413 --> 31:54.699
And she wrote you this beautiful letter thanking you for it, because now Sacks finally had got his view.

31:54.739 --> 31:56.581
He finally had got the recognition.

31:56.601 --> 32:00.325
And when Blotner went back and revised the one volume,

32:00.878 --> 32:07.487
He had to put Cummings in, and then using our letter volume and other materials, so he didn't rewrite that significantly.

32:07.507 --> 32:07.867
Oh, he did.

32:07.887 --> 32:08.709
Significantly.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.411
From what he had done in the first.

32:10.431 --> 32:12.213
So this stuff was going to Firestone?

32:12.233 --> 32:13.936
So, I'll get back to that story.

32:14.296 --> 32:15.337
Don't forget it.

32:15.377 --> 32:16.038
I won't forget it.

32:16.058 --> 32:18.662
Here's a little collection, the Robert Linscott Group.

32:19.403 --> 32:21.345
That's all there was, but that's pretty interesting.

32:21.406 --> 32:25.551
Now, a collector might not have bought this piece, and I'm going to read it to you because the content is scintillating.

32:26.092 --> 32:27.694
It was typed by Faulkner.

32:27.774 --> 32:28.956
Linscott had kept it.

32:28.976 --> 32:29.957
That's the dust jacket.

32:30.123 --> 32:32.845
That's the dust jacket, the first drawing.

32:32.865 --> 32:34.327
I said, no, I'm right on.

32:34.887 --> 32:35.227
Right on.

32:35.268 --> 32:37.890
That's the first conception Faulkner had.

32:37.910 --> 32:38.550
Wow, that's a cross.

32:38.811 --> 32:39.191
Yeah.

32:39.371 --> 32:42.534
A cross, which now appears as the dust jacket on the table.

32:42.674 --> 32:43.435
Isn't that wonderful?

32:43.735 --> 32:45.717
Here's a picture of Faulkner and Robert Linscott.

32:45.737 --> 32:47.178
Yeah, let's take a picture of that, too.

32:47.498 --> 32:54.164
And here is a wonderful little fragment that is not signed by Faulkner, but Linscott, in his hand, put on it, Bill Faulkner.

32:54.184 --> 32:56.586
Faulkner had typed it and thrown it away.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.628
This still didn't get this.

33:00.278 --> 33:00.579
Good.

33:00.960 --> 33:01.280
Thank you.

33:01.501 --> 33:07.555
Listen, anyway, a collector might not have bought this, but this was with the little archive, and I know it was Faulkner's, and furthermore, I know by what he wrote.

33:07.976 --> 33:09.900
And there was this one to Bob Rinscott.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.328
So this is what you call a mini collection.

33:13.348 --> 33:13.869
I like that.

33:14.190 --> 33:16.255
It's a mini collection of five items.

33:16.615 --> 33:19.502
It's one, two, three, four items.

33:20.562 --> 33:22.906
that are souvenirs that Robert Linscott kept.

33:22.926 --> 33:24.448
Who put them together like that?

33:24.468 --> 33:25.209
The book dealer.

33:25.229 --> 33:26.211
Glenn Horowitz had these.

33:26.271 --> 33:27.032
Oh, you got those from what?

33:27.052 --> 33:29.476
Well, these came from Toby Holtzman's collection when he sold it.

33:29.977 --> 33:36.807
When he blew it away, I told you he put it at Michigan and tried to make a big deal about that.

33:37.308 --> 33:40.072
He gave them quantity, and he made this big deal.

33:40.133 --> 33:42.096
He made himself real self-important.

33:42.516 --> 33:44.499
But what he didn't give them was any of the great stuff.

33:44.539 --> 33:47.464
And I bought other great stuff out of that collection, too, including

33:47.613 --> 33:52.921
one of only two known copies of the galley proofs for Absalom Absalom.

33:52.941 --> 33:54.242
Do you spell Linscott's name for me?

33:54.263 --> 33:56.766
I think it's L-I-N-S-C-O-T-T.

33:56.786 --> 33:57.567
We'll have to look it up.

33:57.607 --> 33:58.028
Two Ts?

33:58.448 --> 33:59.530
Yeah, I see.

33:59.550 --> 34:00.772
But so there's Bill and Bob.

34:02.314 --> 34:06.360
There's this wonderful original design for title page.

34:06.380 --> 34:10.726
But now, why doesn't Robert Linscott have more stuff?

34:10.766 --> 34:12.509
Well, because he wasn't close to Faulkner.

34:12.529 --> 34:14.211
He took him home one weekend when he was six.

34:14.933 --> 34:17.917
When Faulkner was alcoholic, they tried to dry him out there at his house.

34:19.179 --> 34:22.343
Which is the kind of assignment you give to a junior editor.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.104
That's right.

34:23.464 --> 34:25.407
Well, Cowley did it once, one weekend.

34:25.908 --> 34:26.969
Linscott did it once.

34:27.490 --> 34:29.392
He was always on the doorstep of the Cumminses.

34:29.412 --> 34:31.175
He virtually lived there for two or three years.

34:31.996 --> 34:34.800
He was up there all the time when he was having terrible times at home.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.322
And listen to this fragment.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.364
Yours received.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.288
My point of view re-publicity piece has not changed.

34:41.649 --> 34:44.873
I still contend that my printed works are in the public domain.

34:44.988 --> 34:46.771
And anyone can bat them around.

34:47.391 --> 34:53.700
But my private life and the photograph face are my own, and I will defend them as such to the end.

34:53.720 --> 34:54.762
I would defend them.

34:55.042 --> 34:57.005
I would defend them as such to the end.

34:57.025 --> 35:03.334
I have deliberately buried myself in this little, lost, almost illiterate town, Oxford.

35:03.905 --> 35:07.850
to keep out of the way so that news people won't notice and remember me.

35:08.611 --> 35:17.283
If, in spite of that, this sort of thing comes down here, I not only won't cooperate, I will probably do whatever I can to impede and frustrate it.

35:18.044 --> 35:33.085
You'd think, with as many people as they seem to be in this country willing to pay any price to get themselves in the public print, that they would let be one insane and eccentric enough not to want to, wouldn't you?

35:34.516 --> 35:35.418
What is that?

35:35.438 --> 35:39.745
This is a piece that he wrote, and this was in regard to Life magazine that was coming down.

35:39.825 --> 35:40.446
I saw this.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.069
Where did I just see this?

35:42.089 --> 35:43.311
You didn't see quite this one.

35:44.353 --> 35:46.056
I think I saw it in your catalog.

35:46.156 --> 35:46.978
Is it in your catalog?

35:47.038 --> 35:47.939
No, I don't think so.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.721
You read another one.

35:48.741 --> 35:50.584
There's one about the Nobel Prize.

35:51.053 --> 35:52.756
that he wrote to Moon Mullins.

35:52.996 --> 35:55.239
Well, people were invading his privacy all the time.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.701
Isn't that a wonderful fragment?

35:56.721 --> 35:58.224
What prompted him to write that, do you think?

35:58.384 --> 36:03.171
Yes, because he found out that they were going to send people... I don't know who he's writing this to, yours received.

36:03.652 --> 36:05.875
It's probably another one like he wrote to Moon Mullins.

36:05.955 --> 36:11.544
When he found out... Random House was probably encouraging that kind of publicity.

36:11.564 --> 36:17.552
But he hated it, and it was at the time he learned Life magazine was going to send a reporter down to do a big article feature on it.

36:17.573 --> 36:19.255
Which he should have been thrilled about, actually.

36:19.235 --> 36:21.017
He didn't like being intruded on.

36:21.057 --> 36:22.278
Yeah, but he wanted to sell books.

36:22.898 --> 36:31.607
We also know now why he treasured his privacy so much, because he had all those affairs and other things going on.

36:32.227 --> 36:37.092
He had a very pragmatic reason for protecting his privacy.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.915
I'm not going to read all these, but I want you to see out of the letters.

36:39.995 --> 36:41.656
We have a great, great collection of letters.

36:42.177 --> 36:43.618
These are new ones that I just acquired.

36:43.638 --> 36:44.579
They came out of Oxford.

36:44.599 --> 36:46.381
They came from his nephew, Jimmy Fulton.

36:47.602 --> 36:48.583
They're full of love.

36:48.884 --> 36:51.727
I contend that these letters... Brother Will.

36:51.947 --> 36:55.009
Yeah, and Brother Will was writing to the son he never had.

36:55.069 --> 36:59.393
He loved Jimmy because Jimmy was virile.

36:59.614 --> 37:02.456
He was a marine fighter pilot.

37:02.476 --> 37:05.078
He was everything that Bill himself had not been.

37:06.039 --> 37:08.822
And I try to get at that in life glimpses, and I even quote this letter.

37:08.842 --> 37:18.250
Yeah, but can I just, before you do that, let me just say, I'm just quoting at random here, but it's on the first paragraph that begins the second page of the letter.

37:18.871 --> 37:20.676
The next milestone is fear.

37:21.478 --> 37:23.544
Sometimes they happen at the same moment.

37:23.604 --> 37:28.276
This means that you fail to pass the foolhardiness milestone and it is too late.

37:28.758 --> 37:33.370
But if the fear is not a result of foolhardiness, then you are all right.

37:33.772 --> 37:35.915
You have learned and are capable of learning.

37:35.935 --> 37:36.956
Oh, isn't that what?

37:36.976 --> 37:37.838
I ought to hear the whole letter.

37:37.858 --> 37:39.540
I know, but that system just pulling out.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.461
This is the best letter.

37:40.501 --> 37:42.264
This is one of the great letters I've ever read.

37:42.284 --> 37:44.307
Yeah, and this is a letter he wrote to Jimmy.

37:44.327 --> 37:46.910
To Jimmy going into the service.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.352
It's not dated, unfortunately.

37:48.372 --> 37:49.313
This one's the early 40s.

37:49.394 --> 37:50.255
He was out in Hollywood.

37:50.275 --> 37:51.436
And I think we can.

37:51.577 --> 37:52.237
We will date it.

37:52.778 --> 37:53.439
It was like 42.

37:54.661 --> 37:54.801
Mm-hmm.

37:54.983 --> 37:55.684
Look at this one.

37:55.724 --> 37:56.345
Good luck, Jim.

37:56.365 --> 37:57.907
Plenty of revs and give them hell.

37:58.108 --> 37:58.508
That's great.

37:58.528 --> 37:59.910
Getting ready to go off into the service.

37:59.930 --> 38:00.952
And here's a better one.

38:00.972 --> 38:01.693
These are a little later.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.095
But holograph, very rare.

38:03.796 --> 38:04.878
Faulkner holograph letters.

38:04.958 --> 38:09.785
Oh, and by the way, Hemingway wrote literally thousands of letters.

38:09.966 --> 38:11.448
40, 50,000 letters.

38:11.528 --> 38:13.691
And you can see why it took him so long.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.597
Faulkner, we don't know a thousand letters that Faulkner wrote.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.463
And we've got about 200 of them here.

38:22.540 --> 38:25.063
And that is unbelievable considering I didn't have shit.

38:25.404 --> 38:29.149
It's 20% of the known... I didn't have shit when I started.

38:29.249 --> 38:33.955
And when I'm talking about it, in 1978, when Bob and I met each other, I did not have a letter.

38:34.315 --> 38:37.279
I did not have one photograph.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.382
I did not have any scripts.

38:39.462 --> 38:40.523
I did not have any wills.

38:42.106 --> 38:45.870
When I met you in 78, I was a book collector.

38:46.271 --> 38:49.375
Because I joined forces with Bob, the scholar,

38:50.283 --> 38:55.050
I learned that the kind of stuff I was going to go collect was going to be the meat of scholarship.

38:55.070 --> 38:56.272
Well, the archival stuff.

38:56.292 --> 38:56.853
Absolutely.

38:56.873 --> 38:59.978
Well, I told him that we see three phases that the collection's gone through.

38:59.998 --> 39:04.084
You know, there was the book collection, and it became a world-class book collection.

39:04.585 --> 39:13.940
But then, as you got into the exhibits and the publishing, then the focus of the emphasis in the collection changed to manuscripts and letters and documents and things that would support the scholarship.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.120
Right.

39:14.381 --> 39:16.003
And now, as we...

39:16.338 --> 39:21.843
the third phase with the Faulkner Center and allowing scholars to use it and so on.

39:21.863 --> 39:28.330
And that's been fun for me to watch the evolution of the collector and the collection into these different phases.

39:28.370 --> 39:30.972
Let me tell you my sense of pride.

39:30.992 --> 39:33.315
And each of the earlier phases continues.

39:33.395 --> 39:36.538
It's not that you, you know, it's a layer you add on.

39:36.598 --> 39:37.659
He's still a book collector.

39:38.440 --> 39:42.023
And we'll still do publishing when we have the Faulkner Center, but you add on another layer.

39:42.083 --> 39:46.007
And where we're going now is we're actually trying to acquire scholarship itself.

39:46.747 --> 40:09.269
Bob and I took a wonderful drive up to Ann Arbor, Michigan to the home of Joe and Yvonne Blotner a year ago and brought back with us something that I had prepared for a year prior to that, the entire archive of perhaps 20,000 letters and notes and manuscripts that went into the making of the seminal William Faulkner biography of Blotner.

40:09.369 --> 40:15.775
We have all that archive here for scholars to use for years, the letter files from John Faulkner.

40:15.957 --> 40:24.648
from Murray Faulkner, from the mistress Joan Williams, from the mistress Elsa Johnson, from people writing all over the country.

40:24.728 --> 40:26.370
It's an incredible archive.

40:26.390 --> 40:29.614
Did you have to trade Wagner for that?

40:29.634 --> 40:29.714
Yes.

40:29.734 --> 40:30.034
$35,000.

40:30.775 --> 40:33.098
I thought it was extremely reasonable under the circumstances.

40:33.138 --> 40:34.620
Most collectors passed on it.

40:35.020 --> 40:35.981
Virginia passed on it.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.885
Virginia passed on that archive.

40:38.945 --> 40:39.706
He couldn't believe it.

40:39.866 --> 40:40.547
I couldn't believe it.

40:41.303 --> 40:44.247
Why would they have passed on something that significant?

40:44.447 --> 40:48.112
I've got letters in there from Murray, from John, you name it.

40:48.132 --> 40:51.637
$35,000 is not a lot of money for that.

40:52.237 --> 40:53.018
It was a lot of money.

40:53.058 --> 40:53.839
Two books?

40:53.860 --> 40:55.822
It was, yeah, two books?

40:55.842 --> 40:57.024
That was the first trade L.D.

40:57.044 --> 40:58.506
worked out as curator.

40:58.566 --> 40:59.427
Yeah.

40:59.447 --> 41:01.970
In his role as a university curator.

41:01.990 --> 41:02.511
Oh, is that right?

41:02.531 --> 41:03.052
What happened?

41:03.072 --> 41:04.133
He traded two books.

41:04.373 --> 41:06.576
Two inscribed books.

41:06.596 --> 41:07.077
Oh, really?

41:07.097 --> 41:07.918
The Blotner Archive.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.677
Did that pain you?

41:09.897 --> 41:13.301
No, it didn't pain me at all, because what we acquired was much more significant.

41:13.381 --> 41:14.422
It all pains me a little bit.

41:14.483 --> 41:18.347
I sold one Malcolm Cowley book, and I might have sold one Phil Stone book.

41:18.367 --> 41:20.129
Well, there was one you were going to show him when to go.

41:20.149 --> 41:20.890
And I didn't find it.

41:21.471 --> 41:22.031
Is that right?

41:22.051 --> 41:28.459
If you caught that a moment ago, he was going to show you a book, but he said, we don't have that one anymore.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.240
That's right.

41:29.260 --> 41:31.463
You caught that, and I caught that.

41:31.483 --> 41:33.605
It bothered me, but not much, and I'll tell you why.

41:33.865 --> 41:37.770
I love the notion of having acquired that archive for scholarship.

41:38.290 --> 41:45.256
Now, what's my feeling right now looking at this letter, holograph letter of Faulkner to his nephew, Jim Faulkner?

41:46.157 --> 41:47.899
I'm so proud that it's here.

41:48.719 --> 41:52.863
I have no pangs that I don't own it physically anymore.

41:53.524 --> 41:56.767
I never look at it with the thought that this is a $3,000 letter.

41:57.788 --> 42:01.011
It doesn't have any meaning for me in that realm.

42:01.031 --> 42:01.791
It never did.

42:02.872 --> 42:04.654
I acquired this group of eight letters.

42:04.834 --> 42:05.955
It was very expensive.

42:05.975 --> 42:07.116
It will cost me one book.

42:09.037 --> 42:09.998
That's how I look at it.

42:10.258 --> 42:10.859
It's worth it.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.420
Fine.

42:13.181 --> 42:17.986
But I don't have any personal sense of either ego or sense of possessiveness.

42:18.646 --> 42:20.268
And I hadn't for the longest time.

42:21.049 --> 42:22.710
This belongs to you, Nick.

42:23.271 --> 42:24.392
It belongs to you, Bob.

42:24.412 --> 42:25.673
And I'm not being histrionic.

42:26.194 --> 42:27.895
It belongs to us who care about literature.

42:28.576 --> 42:32.360
I couldn't give one flaming shit about physically having it in my home.

42:32.380 --> 42:34.682
I never had any of these things in my home.

42:35.002 --> 42:36.043
They weren't fondleable.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.706
I could have had them in my home if I were the fondling type.

42:39.209 --> 42:40.190
the possessive type.

42:40.810 --> 42:41.731
That never drove me.

42:42.392 --> 42:44.274
Well, they didn't even know how big his collection was.

42:44.374 --> 42:45.995
I told you about when he came into this room.

42:46.796 --> 42:47.497
Say that again.

42:48.878 --> 42:51.641
He didn't know how big his collection was when I first met him.

42:52.021 --> 42:53.202
Some of it was at his home.

42:53.222 --> 42:54.743
Some was at his parents' home in St.

42:54.763 --> 42:55.004
Louis.

42:55.024 --> 42:57.926
Some of the more valuable pieces were in the mercantile bank vault.

42:58.687 --> 43:00.329
But he had never seen it all in one place.

43:00.969 --> 43:07.275
And so when we scouted out this room, the possibility of depositing the materials here just to warehouse them to make our work easier,

43:07.795 --> 43:13.640
He walked in here and he looked at this wall over here, which were empty shelves like this.

43:14.021 --> 43:14.862
No doors.

43:16.483 --> 43:18.084
That cabinet was not in the corner.

43:18.165 --> 43:18.965
That was all built.

43:19.466 --> 43:22.429
And so that side looked just like this side.

43:22.449 --> 43:31.237
And so we measured out, and we knew we had to put doors on the cases and all, so we said, Eldie, how much of this space do you need to house the collection?

43:32.318 --> 43:34.900
And he said about half, about half of that wall.

43:35.791 --> 43:39.176
Well, Zink, the librarian, said, we're not going to put doors on just half of it.

43:39.216 --> 43:40.498
We'll put doors on the whole.

43:40.839 --> 43:46.407
Then we moved the collection in, and he kept collecting, and now you see we've spilled over into the Harrison collection.

43:46.508 --> 43:47.890
And we're upstairs with some of it.

43:47.910 --> 43:49.632
We're getting ready to go into this section.

43:49.672 --> 43:53.278
You think at some point Harrison's going to leave the room?

43:53.298 --> 43:53.558
No.

43:56.182 --> 44:01.711
He had never seen the collection all in one place.

44:01.871 --> 44:02.372
He hadn't.

44:02.943 --> 44:04.205
until we moved it into this room.

44:04.645 --> 44:05.767
So it's kind of home now.

44:05.807 --> 44:06.488
And he was amazed.

44:06.568 --> 44:08.851
I think you were amazed that it was as large as it was.

44:08.891 --> 44:09.352
I was amazed.

44:09.372 --> 44:11.154
And that was only half of what he has now.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.336
Now, Carl had a lot.

44:12.456 --> 44:14.138
How much did Carl have that got sold?

44:14.559 --> 44:17.944
He had about half what I have in quantity.

44:18.785 --> 44:22.770
And the bulk of his half were foreign editions and were reprints.

44:23.672 --> 44:25.775
He did not have the quality for the most part.

44:25.815 --> 44:29.760
He probably had a couple hundred items that were absolutely world-class wonderful.

44:30.162 --> 44:34.467
But what Carl did that I admire very much, he was extremely thorough and comprehensive.

44:34.967 --> 44:46.160
If I could have welded one of my dreams early on, and it might not have been his because he was envious of me, but had the two of us been able to mesh our collections, he would have filled in on all the areas I never worked.

44:46.520 --> 44:51.786
I told you earlier on, because of his obsessive nature, he didn't need to buy quality.

44:51.826 --> 44:53.989
He just needed to all the time be acquiring.

44:54.029 --> 44:55.290
That satisfied his needs.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.773
I didn't mind going for months at a time with nothing.

44:58.225 --> 45:01.229
I worked for months at a time to set up acquisitions.

45:01.770 --> 45:05.414
He had a book coming in or packages coming in every week because I used to visit with him.

45:05.835 --> 45:06.996
And he'd get more joy.

45:07.036 --> 45:10.000
He'd get absolutely orgasmic with the thought.

45:10.421 --> 45:11.943
He'd go down and check in his hall.

45:12.423 --> 45:13.625
Is there a package for me today?

45:14.045 --> 45:14.706
Is there a package?

45:14.726 --> 45:15.868
He loved that shit.

45:15.888 --> 45:17.009
And I talked with Margie Cohn.

45:17.049 --> 45:22.476
She told me some of her collectors just loved to come in and buy and have her send them so they could receive a package.

45:22.797 --> 45:24.058
It's like little kids getting gifts.

45:25.059 --> 45:26.341
Well, that's what Carl had in his life.

45:26.461 --> 45:27.102
I didn't need that.

45:27.723 --> 45:31.167
I had a family, I had my occupation, I had my art.

45:32.149 --> 45:35.973
This was really done as a wonderful passion.

45:37.035 --> 45:45.465
And I'll tell you what, it is a beautiful, beautiful passion because I look at letters like this and I'm so very proud that this stuff is here.

45:45.525 --> 45:46.647
This one's a great one.

45:46.667 --> 45:47.948
This one Jimmy wore in his wallet.

45:48.970 --> 45:51.773
And this one was telling people that if Jimmy ever got stranded,

45:51.938 --> 45:58.048
But all I had to do was loan money to Jimmy on William Faulkner, the bank of Oxford.

45:58.188 --> 46:01.273
Well, this is a letter that Jimmy folded and kept in his wallet.

46:01.293 --> 46:03.917
It's from Uncle William, right?

46:04.578 --> 46:07.703
And this is dated 30 July 1943, but he does say...

46:08.122 --> 46:10.567
I love you and I'm proud as hell of you.

46:10.607 --> 46:12.671
Maybe we will see one another in September.

46:12.691 --> 46:13.432
That's the kind of thing.

46:13.472 --> 46:14.655
That's the son he never had.

46:14.915 --> 46:17.260
And that the boy.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.987
And that the kid folded and put in his wallet.

46:21.007 --> 46:22.770
Because this part showed right here.

46:23.331 --> 46:24.173
And that's right.

46:24.153 --> 46:25.334
And that's exactly right.

46:25.374 --> 46:25.975
And that's it.

46:25.995 --> 46:28.157
This little part here with William.

46:28.217 --> 46:29.858
You can borrow money on my account.

46:30.079 --> 46:30.779
Oh, is that what it says?

46:30.879 --> 46:31.620
I didn't read it.

46:31.640 --> 46:32.461
Yeah, that's what it says.

46:32.481 --> 46:34.363
These are already printed in the volumes, right?

46:34.423 --> 46:35.464
No, no, they're not.

46:35.524 --> 46:36.605
Oh, you just got these?

46:36.625 --> 46:37.425
You just got these.

46:37.626 --> 46:38.126
Yeah, there's a lot.

46:38.146 --> 46:39.427
Because I figured I could, you know.

46:39.447 --> 46:41.629
Oh, no, but these are going to come out in the next volume.

46:41.770 --> 46:43.331
All of our books are already outdated.

46:43.371 --> 46:45.393
They need revision because this guy won't quit.

46:45.673 --> 46:46.934
Now, what do you mean you just got these?

46:47.015 --> 46:48.856
These are the ones that you traded the books for.

46:49.116 --> 46:49.957
I just got these.

46:50.218 --> 46:50.938
Like just when?

46:52.259 --> 46:52.860
Two months ago.

46:54.157 --> 46:55.198
Three months ago, maybe.

46:57.721 --> 46:58.282
Look at that.

46:58.302 --> 46:58.902
These are wonderful.

46:58.922 --> 46:59.823
See, he's still collecting.

47:00.184 --> 47:00.384
Yeah.

47:00.404 --> 47:01.405
Tell him about it.

47:01.445 --> 47:02.306
Tell him about it.

47:02.406 --> 47:02.767
My favorite story.

47:02.787 --> 47:03.908
You haven't given up this bullshit.

47:04.028 --> 47:07.372
You've got to tell him about the De Gaulle manuscript.

47:07.432 --> 47:08.513
I pulled it for you.

47:08.693 --> 47:09.634
Okay, I will.

47:09.915 --> 47:10.576
I'll do that right now.

47:10.596 --> 47:11.577
Let me just show you this one, too.

47:12.197 --> 47:12.738
It's another set.

47:13.419 --> 47:14.620
I just picked this up last year.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.382
How did I get these?

47:16.462 --> 47:16.843
I forgot.

47:17.003 --> 47:18.404
I must have traded something for these, too.

47:19.386 --> 47:20.747
These are absolutely scintillating.

47:20.787 --> 47:22.409
These also came from the nephew, Jimmy.

47:22.649 --> 47:23.370
These are letters?

47:24.481 --> 47:30.910
These came from the nephew, but these came sort of circuitously.

47:31.030 --> 47:33.133
That's off the record.

47:33.153 --> 47:36.097
That little part is going to come out of that typescript, the circuitous part.

47:36.838 --> 47:38.640
Let's just say these are letters, mother letters.

47:39.141 --> 47:39.962
That the nephew had.

47:40.162 --> 47:41.004
That the nephew had.

47:41.504 --> 47:42.365
Wow.

47:42.386 --> 47:51.518
These are six letters, and they all document, for the most part, one little brief period where Faulkner was going, was he not, to work with Howard Hawks on the land of the pharaohs.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.456
It's really quite fascinating.

47:53.476 --> 47:53.837
Well, here's one.

47:53.857 --> 47:54.778
He's at Random House.

47:54.878 --> 47:55.398
Random House.

47:55.418 --> 47:57.080
Yeah, and he's tapping a letter, Dear Moms.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.021
Dear Moms, I finally got straightened out.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.884
I will stay here until December 1st, finish my novel.

48:01.904 --> 48:08.730
I'll meet Mr. Hawks in Paris, December 1st or 2nd, to stay until the job is finished, which means I will X-mas at home.

48:09.650 --> 48:11.252
We'll be back, I hope, in February.

48:11.272 --> 48:14.014
I can't turn Mr. Hawks down because he has been too good to me.

48:14.054 --> 48:18.939
Besides the $15,000 in expenses, the trip will cost me nothing.

48:18.959 --> 48:19.339
I am well.

48:19.399 --> 48:20.580
I believe the book is a good one.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.741
What book is he talking about?

48:21.991 --> 48:24.955
All the people, they'll like what they've seen of it.

48:25.035 --> 48:27.318
I will write again soon and make all arrangements.

48:27.818 --> 48:30.121
You and Dean will leave before I get back.

48:30.141 --> 48:30.521
I love you.

48:30.662 --> 48:31.963
Here's the scholar again.

48:32.003 --> 48:41.094
You see, if you know from studying Faulkner's life that Estelle was always jealous of Faulkner's mother because every afternoon he'd walk up the street and visit his mother.

48:41.735 --> 48:47.342
And often when Estelle even was ill, Faulkner seemed to be more concerned about his mother than he was his wife.

48:47.983 --> 48:51.407
And so if you know that Faulkner's relationship to his mother

48:51.961 --> 48:54.224
created a problem in his marriage.

48:54.404 --> 48:58.029
And then you have an opportunity here to get some letters from Faulkner to that mother.

48:59.291 --> 49:01.134
And you see how all that ties together.

49:01.294 --> 49:08.043
And so it's very, very exciting because just the salutation on their dear mom says a lot about how Faulkner felt.

49:08.063 --> 49:14.352
And then he's writing with such detail, filling her in on all his little details, even like his bowel movements almost.

49:14.893 --> 49:16.695
And you know, he didn't do that to anybody else.

49:16.716 --> 49:19.960
And he wasn't writing during some of his period, but he wasn't writing as well.

49:20.243 --> 49:21.805
sending stuff to the Random House.

49:22.165 --> 49:25.649
He was real frugal.

49:25.829 --> 49:28.032
And that's another little biograph.

49:28.052 --> 49:30.094
Cairo, stationary.

49:30.615 --> 49:31.616
I read an article recently.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.078
This is airmail, why not, right?

49:33.258 --> 49:35.521
Mina House is considered one of the great hotels in the world.

49:35.541 --> 49:43.209
I was just looking at a book when I was in New York about great hotels, and it had the Mina House in there, right on the Nile, by the pyramids.

49:43.229 --> 49:44.671
They stayed in real class, you know.

49:44.691 --> 49:46.033
That's what Hawke should do for you.

49:46.053 --> 49:47.314
Well, that's what he did, too.

49:48.425 --> 49:49.907
I just saw that and thought about that.

49:49.927 --> 49:50.769
I was going to tell you that.

49:50.869 --> 49:51.830
You just got these, right?

49:52.111 --> 49:53.954
I got those last year, about a year and a half.

49:53.974 --> 49:57.279
And these are... These are incredible.

49:57.299 --> 49:59.663
These are for Faulkner scholars, for Faulkner collectors.

49:59.683 --> 50:03.529
I mean, to get a trove like that, that's a little trove of six.

50:03.589 --> 50:04.651
That's a little trove of eight.

50:04.871 --> 50:08.858
All of a sudden, you turn around and you've got a world-class collection if you can work out enough of that.

50:09.319 --> 50:13.285
But now, I won't tell you that a little bit of the collection didn't come from dealers.

50:13.923 --> 50:15.445
I had some help.

50:15.525 --> 50:19.449
The major help actually came from one scintillating dealer, Glenn Horowitz.

50:19.469 --> 50:21.411
He is the one I told you that I admire most.

50:21.811 --> 50:23.453
He's the only dealer I really admire.

50:23.673 --> 50:24.434
I loved Margie.

50:25.435 --> 50:28.037
But I loved her because I had sentimental attachments to that.

50:28.097 --> 50:30.059
She's the one that really got me going on Faulkner.

50:30.440 --> 50:31.201
Not Henry Wenning.

50:31.681 --> 50:32.302
She really did.

50:33.082 --> 50:36.526
But I admire Glenn because he's gritty.

50:37.026 --> 50:38.108
Because he gets right in there.

50:38.408 --> 50:39.329
Because he travels.

50:39.449 --> 50:40.510
He's been all over the world.

50:41.271 --> 50:42.512
He's been to visit...

50:44.230 --> 50:46.414
The Thomas Mann estate in Switzerland.

50:46.955 --> 50:48.038
He's traveled to England.

50:48.138 --> 50:52.366
He's bought collections out of there, all over from people.

50:52.386 --> 50:57.597
He's traveled to Hawaii to acquire Leonie Dell's collection of Henry James.

50:57.737 --> 51:01.344
I mean, Glenn has done it the way I've done it.

51:01.364 --> 51:02.627
He's done it as a business.

51:03.451 --> 51:07.256
But I admire him, and he has been the one to ferret out some of this stuff now.

51:07.477 --> 51:16.750
And I could tell you tales about how he could ferret some stuff out that I opened up, and I couldn't get it because I wasn't trusted by a few people, and ironically, he, the dealer, was.

51:17.651 --> 51:22.297
And so we did a triangulation by which I could get the materials.

51:22.317 --> 51:27.805
And I'm not saying a collusion or that there was anything untoward about it, but rather there were times when I...

51:28.747 --> 51:31.631
had to become, as it were, my own intermediary.

51:32.332 --> 51:34.916
I had to send someone on to a dealer to get it to me.

51:34.956 --> 51:35.978
Some people just didn't watch.

51:36.018 --> 51:37.981
Well, see, I find residences like this.

51:38.602 --> 51:46.254
I find a cache of letters between Henry Huntington and Clarence Brigham that nobody knows about the American Anthropocene Society.

51:47.195 --> 51:52.543
And lo and behold, Huntington was using Brigham to buy books in Europe.

51:53.030 --> 51:56.234
And the reason was, they just didn't want to sell anyone at Huntington.

51:56.254 --> 51:56.815
They were pissed off.

51:56.835 --> 51:58.217
He was buying up everything.

51:58.417 --> 51:59.218
And they just wouldn't sell.

51:59.339 --> 52:01.562
Or if you bought, they were going to jack the prices up.

52:01.922 --> 52:05.627
So good old Clarence, who everybody respected, and I got the letters.

52:06.609 --> 52:07.650
This is great stuff.

52:07.670 --> 52:09.092
This is unpublished stuff.

52:09.252 --> 52:11.015
Absolutely cherry, unpublished letters.

52:11.555 --> 52:12.977
And I almost died.

52:13.378 --> 52:15.321
They said, you can only copy 20 letters a day.

52:15.721 --> 52:18.285
I said, Sidney, you've got to copy all.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.608
I can't leave you a little piece of letters.

52:20.828 --> 52:22.210
This is my position.

52:22.443 --> 52:23.685
You can go back tomorrow.

52:23.825 --> 52:26.850
I said, they may not be here tomorrow.

52:26.870 --> 52:27.972
You have a feeling, right?

52:28.834 --> 52:30.496
That's good stuff.

52:30.797 --> 52:33.882
What I'm suggesting is that sometimes you have to do things.

52:34.803 --> 52:36.767
This is something that still worries me.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.631
I don't think that we've got these ordered in Xeroxes, do we?

52:39.651 --> 52:42.296
Can I take a break and hit the head for about five seconds?

52:42.777 --> 52:43.698
Do we have these things?

52:44.319 --> 52:46.122
We're all hand-typed by fault, right?

52:46.692 --> 52:47.333
Originals.

52:47.673 --> 52:48.675
Don't get them out of order.

52:48.715 --> 52:49.736
We're not in order here.

52:49.796 --> 52:51.499
We don't have, I'm not sure we have a copy of this.

52:51.739 --> 52:52.601
These are the order.

52:52.781 --> 52:53.862
This is the order in which.

52:53.963 --> 52:54.483
So what is it?

52:54.583 --> 52:59.210
This was one of the sets that I found in Buzz Becerides' desk.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.772
Well, this is out of California.

53:00.792 --> 53:03.336
This is the DeGaulle story that Faulkner had banged out.

53:03.456 --> 53:04.958
This is the celebrated story.

53:04.978 --> 53:08.604
You were ready to leave and the desk wouldn't open or something like that.

53:08.724 --> 53:10.326
And I found those manuscripts.

53:10.807 --> 53:12.930
And these were absolutely sensational.

53:12.950 --> 53:15.454
I found them in the last minutes before I was going to leave.

53:15.474 --> 53:16.395
Here's another set of them.

53:17.152 --> 53:19.936
Look at this thing.

53:19.956 --> 53:20.537
Look at this stuff.

53:22.079 --> 53:24.223
Why didn't he number them?

53:24.283 --> 53:25.304
No, no, don't, don't.

53:25.364 --> 53:27.167
No, no, no, I'm not shuffling them, but did he number them?

53:27.187 --> 53:28.709
They numbered because they were in and out.

53:28.950 --> 53:30.372
They were outtakes and inversions.

53:30.893 --> 53:32.435
We haven't worked on this.

53:32.896 --> 53:35.520
Why the hell didn't he number them, huh?

53:35.540 --> 53:38.725
He numbered them, but he didn't care about what came after him.

53:38.765 --> 53:40.387
This was a lot of stuff.

53:40.587 --> 53:41.749
Oh, wonderful stuff.

53:41.769 --> 53:43.352
Have you done anything to treat this paper?

53:43.772 --> 53:44.914
No, we're going to have to do that.

53:45.316 --> 53:46.898
You really should.

53:46.958 --> 53:48.099
This looks like copy paper.

53:48.119 --> 53:48.940
It's coming off, it is.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.541
That's in line to be done.

53:51.282 --> 53:53.604
That is copy paper, and it's okay right now.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.946
It's fairly stable, but I don't see as much of it as I kid.

53:55.966 --> 53:58.148
I don't want to handle any more of it.

53:58.269 --> 53:58.589
Yeah.

53:58.609 --> 53:59.410
It's a great trope.

53:59.910 --> 54:00.931
This was a great trope.

54:00.951 --> 54:01.892
But this is what we're talking here.

54:01.912 --> 54:03.113
We're handling the buzz.

54:03.333 --> 54:04.475
This is the DeGaulle story.

54:04.495 --> 54:09.540
This was Faulkner's first solo flight for Warner Brothers.

54:09.580 --> 54:15.205
And when he went out in June of 42, this was his first assignment for Robert Faulkner.

54:15.623 --> 54:19.287
to create an original screenplay called The De Gaulle Story.

54:19.928 --> 54:27.215
It has subsequently been published by us, by University Press in Mississippi, the screenplay, actually a couple of the screenplay versions.

54:28.056 --> 54:33.021
Galimar in Paris, Edicione's Galimar, has published it in translation.

54:33.682 --> 54:41.090
It is now being turned in over there to a television docudrama with an adaptation script.

54:41.330 --> 54:43.993
It is being produced this month.

54:44.530 --> 54:47.634
Ghalimar is now contracting with us.

54:48.035 --> 54:54.003
This is the acquisition of this is what prompted a pretty good-sized New York Times piece, I think.

54:54.063 --> 54:54.744
Indeed it did.

54:54.804 --> 54:57.007
And that's what prompted me to call you for the first time.

54:57.027 --> 54:57.708
Yes, that's right.

54:58.168 --> 54:59.190
And then it, that's right.

54:59.450 --> 54:59.851
McDowell.

54:59.911 --> 55:00.892
Ed McDowell.

55:01.212 --> 55:02.774
Ed McDowell, that's right.

55:03.155 --> 55:06.960
And then subsequently, we had a huge article in Loexpress.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.162
in Paris.

55:09.222 --> 55:12.265
They were more excited about the find than anybody.

55:12.546 --> 55:14.388
This was a find, all right.

55:14.848 --> 55:17.151
Bees had been sitting there for 40 some odd years.

55:18.833 --> 55:24.019
By the time I got out to Buzz's house, Buzz had no idea they were out there, that they were in that desk.

55:24.159 --> 55:25.640
Spelled Buzz's last name from my text.

55:25.660 --> 55:26.882
His name is Bezzerides.

55:27.002 --> 55:29.405
He's Armenian.

55:30.085 --> 55:34.270
And it is spelled B-E-Z-Z-E-R-I-D-E-S.

55:34.651 --> 55:35.351
Two Zs.

55:35.371 --> 55:35.952
Yeah.

55:37.518 --> 55:42.145
Buzz worked at Warner Brothers, and I don't want to go into that whole story.

55:42.185 --> 55:43.847
No, no, it's been written.

55:44.087 --> 55:44.508
I can get it.

55:44.588 --> 55:51.298
But these were wonderful, and we have all kinds of other spectacular biographical documents.

55:51.358 --> 55:54.422
I don't know if Bob found any of those to show.

55:54.502 --> 56:05.177
How about some of those things that we did show glass, like that folio thing and stuff like that.

56:05.198 --> 56:06.259
There's so much in here.

56:06.526 --> 56:10.371
Let's show you just a little more and then we'll probably stop because it really will get meaningless.

56:10.391 --> 56:11.592
I think I've got it.

56:11.612 --> 56:12.353
It's an overload.

56:12.373 --> 56:12.594
Yeah.

56:12.674 --> 56:13.635
Well, it's good.

56:14.036 --> 56:14.696
Fun for me.

56:15.337 --> 56:30.517
Sometimes people ask me about the significance of this collection in terms of the relationship with the other, like Virginia or Texas or Mississippi, because there are four, essentially four major academic repositories for faulty material.

56:30.877 --> 56:34.862
Now, as a book collection, this is better than all the others put together.

56:35.281 --> 56:37.764
It's the finest Faulkner book collection to work.

56:39.306 --> 56:43.251
In terms of the 1940s Warner Brothers movie scripts, it's the best.

56:43.391 --> 56:50.320
It has all of the 40s Warner Brothers except The Big Sleep, which got sold off before L.D.

56:50.380 --> 56:51.802
acquired the material.

56:52.163 --> 56:53.565
That's the only one that's missing.

56:53.585 --> 56:59.512
It has Faulkner's complete, with the exception of The Big Sleep, it's got all of the work that Faulkner did for Warner Brothers in the 1940s.

56:59.853 --> 57:02.436
Nobody else has that.

57:03.057 --> 57:10.131
In letters, the Phil Stone letters and the Estelle Faulkner letters are unique to this collection.

57:11.132 --> 57:12.034
Nobody has those.

57:12.295 --> 57:23.496
Of course, they don't have the Faulkner letters that are here are unique too, but in addition to, there are other places that have a lot of Faulkner letters, but this has the Phil Stone letters, this has Estelle Faulkner's letters.

57:23.864 --> 57:26.647
What are some other areas, L.D., where it's unique?

57:26.667 --> 57:30.751
I mean, there's some overlapping in all these collections, too, but like manuscripts.

57:31.171 --> 57:32.873
Well, you got some biographical things here.

57:32.893 --> 57:33.554
Right, the wills.

57:33.614 --> 57:40.481
The wills are... I had that treated, and I'm going to have all those pages you said de-acidified.

57:40.561 --> 57:42.483
I'm going to start working on each of those.

57:42.503 --> 57:44.825
I had that one treated, so it'll last.

57:44.845 --> 57:49.990
That is a one-of-a-kind, it's the only known manuscript of Faulkner's Legion of Honor speech.

57:50.662 --> 57:52.404
Yes, there are so many unique items in this.

57:52.524 --> 57:53.405
And it's in French.

57:53.926 --> 57:54.847
Yes, it's in French.

57:55.167 --> 57:56.429
It was the way Faulkner read it.

57:57.871 --> 58:06.161
Faulkner gave this to Sachs comments and he inscribed it for him.

58:06.181 --> 58:07.062
Yeah, that's great.

58:07.102 --> 58:10.506
He gave the speech and then he had it and then he gave it to Sachs as a momentum.

58:10.866 --> 58:11.587
This is what he read.

58:12.148 --> 58:14.290
Un homme libre, right?

58:14.310 --> 58:14.931
A free man.

58:16.042 --> 58:19.426
And it's not great French either, but it's what he wrote himself.

58:19.726 --> 58:20.106
Not bad.

58:20.327 --> 58:21.227
Not bad is right.

58:21.268 --> 58:22.629
They understood what he was saying, right?

58:22.649 --> 58:25.272
The document is wonderful.

58:25.292 --> 58:25.732
Yeah, they understood.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.175
It's a wonderful document.

58:28.195 --> 58:29.536
Here's a wonderful letter I found.

58:29.757 --> 58:31.659
It was at Victoria's in one of her boxes.

58:31.719 --> 58:33.380
My friend Victoria, this was her mother.

58:34.121 --> 58:34.862
And this was when he went.

58:34.882 --> 58:36.363
He was trying to get a new publisher in 35.

58:36.644 --> 58:37.925
Well, look how wonderful.

58:38.326 --> 58:39.527
Wonderful, wonderful.

58:40.348 --> 58:41.068
Isn't that gorgeous?

58:41.209 --> 58:42.350
This is Victoria Stockwell.

58:42.970 --> 58:43.571
That's his daughter.

58:43.611 --> 58:45.373
Box 170, Oxford, Mississippi.

58:46.805 --> 58:49.191
I love it that they kept one of these things.

58:49.211 --> 58:49.772
Oh, tell me.

58:49.913 --> 58:51.276
Bob, I can't stand this.

58:51.316 --> 58:53.842
I'm having such fun going through this.

58:53.923 --> 58:56.248
I'm having such fun going through this shit, I can't even believe it.

58:56.268 --> 58:57.010
Dear sister.

58:58.173 --> 59:01.000
Nobody does this for classes from time to time, but...

59:01.334 --> 59:14.030
I spent a semester in London last year, and then he was setting up his time in his press operation, so we did go about a year without doing much of this.

59:14.330 --> 59:16.974
We do get him down as often as we can.

59:16.994 --> 59:20.198
Students and groups to do exhibits.

59:20.238 --> 59:26.065
I'm going to be down every second week now, too, and I'm going to go at one of the things I intend to do with this, of course, is get it ordered.

59:26.346 --> 59:28.689
You have no idea how many manuscripts are in there by looking at that.

59:28.709 --> 59:30.531
It looks like just two cases full of manuscripts.

59:30.832 --> 59:32.736
Shit, there are thousands of pages.

59:33.678 --> 59:35.161
I never stopped to count.

59:35.181 --> 59:37.947
That's another thing I met in the collectors I met.

59:38.247 --> 59:42.316
They could tell me how many feet, linear feet of shelving they had.

59:42.717 --> 59:45.062
They could tell me how many pages, how many books.

59:45.763 --> 59:47.948
That kind of stuff is obsession in the wrong direction.

59:48.048 --> 59:50.072
The famous Faulkner collector, Linton Massey.

59:50.558 --> 59:54.102
Bob and I found in one of our letters that he wrote to someone, he was bragging.

59:54.122 --> 59:59.227
At that time, he had 35 linear feet of Faulkner on my shelves.

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:05.374
That, to me, is the wrong attitude, folks.

01:00:05.794 --> 01:00:09.999
There's something really gross about that.

01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:11.160
There's some of that here, too.

01:00:12.061 --> 01:00:13.182
That same obsession.

01:00:14.343 --> 01:00:15.945
It's with quantity and not quality.

01:00:16.886 --> 01:00:20.430
Ultimately, you've got to be... This was an early thing that came from Vance Carter Broach.

01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:24.578
The black bridge swung in the white rose tree.

01:00:24.658 --> 01:00:25.599
Faulkner typed it out.

01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:27.423
Faulkner put the little hand note.

01:00:27.443 --> 01:00:27.944
That's a poem.

01:00:28.164 --> 01:00:29.907
He's writing to Aunt Bama.

01:00:29.967 --> 01:00:31.350
It's a three stanza poem.

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.892
Each stanza is about three.

01:00:33.053 --> 01:00:34.816
There are two known copies of this that exist.

01:00:34.956 --> 01:00:35.758
Two known copies.

01:00:35.998 --> 01:00:37.561
One's at Texas in a burnt form.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:38.723
I think I've seen it.

01:00:38.743 --> 01:00:39.124
I saw it.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:40.446
I handled it.

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:41.608
Burnt fragment.

01:00:41.977 --> 01:00:42.998
This is the second copy.

01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:45.421
Look at this wonderful little coda in Faulkner's hand.

01:00:45.482 --> 01:00:49.967
Mrs. Oldham of Oxford, who has musical talent, is composing music for this one.

01:00:50.007 --> 01:00:51.109
Who is Mrs. Oldham?

01:00:51.529 --> 01:00:56.656
Well, she's his wife-to-be's mother.

01:00:58.498 --> 01:00:59.400
Estelle Oldham.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.424
This was Estelle Oldham's mother, Lida.

01:01:03.565 --> 01:01:08.912
And this was a note he had written when he sent this poem to his beloved Aunt Bama.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.985
And so Bama bequeathed this to Vance.

01:01:12.566 --> 01:01:13.689
So I acquired that.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:16.074
How did the one that Texas has get burned?

01:01:16.094 --> 01:01:16.976
Here's more.

01:01:16.996 --> 01:01:18.760
Here are horns that are ones of a kind.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.045
These are versions of Bama.
