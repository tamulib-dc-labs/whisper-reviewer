WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:03.279
I'll go on.

00:03.299 --> 00:05.102
Now we're talking to Nico Israel.

00:05.763 --> 00:12.092
And you mentioned, sir, that you know the story of Avon or more, because I'm going to update that chapter in a future edition of the book.

00:12.553 --> 00:13.354
Don't mention.

00:13.394 --> 00:14.316
No, but I won't.

00:14.336 --> 00:21.086
I mean, it's correct, but I'm telling you nothing... No fantasy.

00:22.689 --> 00:28.097
In 1975, we had Inhold and Amsterdam, an international affair.

00:29.950 --> 00:35.396
Among the American visitors was a man named Haven O'Moore.

00:36.017 --> 00:36.797
Never heard of him.

00:37.498 --> 00:43.144
He comes a man, which is rather for friendship.

00:43.204 --> 00:47.729
It is like it is, and so I never knew of Haven O'Moore.

00:48.810 --> 00:55.097
When he came to my booth, I had done a rather important rare emphasis, good condition.

00:55.904 --> 01:00.249
Not a tremendous price, let's say 40,000 or something like that.

01:01.070 --> 01:05.416
He saw it and he liked it and he said, you're going to give me a discount.

01:05.436 --> 01:06.697
He says that every day.

01:06.717 --> 01:14.266
And then he was rather persistent and I said, no, I'm sorry, not my habit.

01:14.326 --> 01:16.449
Then you have to look for another client.

01:16.469 --> 01:21.355
I said, that's fine, Mr. Moore, but at least the point in a way is,

01:21.790 --> 01:28.299
I didn't think that you are my type of, that I am your type of bookseller.

01:28.779 --> 01:32.244
And I don't find that you are my type of collector.

01:32.965 --> 01:34.527
By Mr. O'Moore.

01:35.709 --> 01:36.249
This was that.

01:36.770 --> 01:45.402
An hour later he comes back and says, I'll give him another thought and probably I may be willing to buy it.

01:45.482 --> 01:46.503
I said, I'm totally sorry.

01:47.084 --> 01:48.246
But his husband is great.

01:48.886 --> 01:51.510
I just sold it to one of my Dutch clients.

01:52.621 --> 01:53.482
Impossible.

01:53.522 --> 01:55.404
Who wants a book like that except me?

01:55.424 --> 02:01.309
I said, well, Mr. Moore, you may believe me, then I'll say something.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.290
I'll tell you something.

02:02.310 --> 02:03.231
It's the truth.

02:03.311 --> 02:04.452
I think it's not the truth.

02:04.873 --> 02:09.197
I saw the book just half an hour after you left.

02:09.497 --> 02:09.897
And you did.

02:09.917 --> 02:11.018
Of course.

02:12.039 --> 02:18.966
So, about a year later, I got a telephone call from

02:19.655 --> 02:27.203
He lived in Amsterdam and I said, I would like to see him.

02:27.223 --> 02:28.464
I said, of course, you're welcome.

02:28.484 --> 02:28.944
We met.

02:29.265 --> 02:31.367
I think you'll see his collector.

02:32.368 --> 02:38.053
And I always like to talk with people and say, oh, fine, come.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.577
So I had enough.

02:41.717 --> 02:45.521
He's at the Kaiserschaft in Amsterdam and he came there.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.962
I showed him a great, great book.

02:47.303 --> 02:48.784
It was a great book.

02:49.642 --> 03:14.383
uh famous early edition of colonies in a way it is the second west map in a way the first this real map some of the first is a kind of different one different 77 and 78 wrong edition besides the bare rare orchids and they're cable and he bought it

03:14.600 --> 03:16.142
That was at the sale.

03:16.323 --> 03:17.324
That was in the sale.

03:17.404 --> 03:22.132
Yeah, and then I had it in my catalogue.

03:22.152 --> 03:25.898
Catalogue was just going to be printed, and he bought it.

03:25.918 --> 03:26.739
So that was that.

03:27.300 --> 03:27.981
He paid the bill.

03:28.061 --> 03:28.963
Everything was fine.

03:28.983 --> 03:34.912
So that was the first time I met his wife, and I said she was a very nice woman.

03:35.934 --> 03:37.396
And that was that.

03:37.456 --> 03:40.962
We met again in the United States, somewhere in New York.

03:41.650 --> 03:50.163
That's kind of the way, did he introduce himself as Dr. Romo?

03:50.684 --> 03:52.407
That I can't remember.

03:52.427 --> 03:54.650
I think he introduced himself as Abraham.

03:54.871 --> 03:56.493
He always wanted to be known as Abraham.

03:56.513 --> 03:58.516
He was a good looking man.

03:58.657 --> 03:59.778
Oh yes, absolutely.

03:59.838 --> 04:01.060
He impressed a lot of people.

04:01.401 --> 04:03.164
He fooled a lot of people.

04:04.025 --> 04:06.028
Yeah, but then I read your story.

04:06.048 --> 04:07.270
I still can't make it out.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.624
I'll tell you more when we're done.

04:10.644 --> 04:12.847
I know, I've since learned a lot more.

04:13.147 --> 04:16.112
Because he threatened to sue me, you know, as you can imagine.

04:16.132 --> 04:16.372
Oh, he did?

04:16.833 --> 04:17.153
Oh, yeah.

04:17.534 --> 04:18.495
But he threatened, he didn't.

04:19.436 --> 04:22.040
And he can't now because it's too late.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.222
There's nothing to sue me about.

04:23.622 --> 04:25.605
You can only sue if I made mistakes.

04:26.126 --> 04:31.874
I must say that when I read the story, it's like yours.

04:32.214 --> 04:33.516
It's the same story.

04:33.576 --> 04:34.718
It's the same story.

04:35.379 --> 04:36.260
It's the same story.

04:36.621 --> 04:37.662
Tries to get him down.

04:38.215 --> 04:39.136
on the price.

04:40.318 --> 04:43.842
But he didn't ask a question from me.

04:44.744 --> 04:45.384
He wanted 10%.

04:45.425 --> 04:49.630
That's not my habit.

04:49.890 --> 04:55.738
I mean, I saw books at a fixed price, and then you can prove you're a dealer, you get your 10%.

04:55.938 --> 04:58.101
Otherwise, that's right.

04:58.282 --> 04:58.942
This is business.

04:59.423 --> 05:02.307
It's like asking a doctor to give you a discount for his services.

05:02.367 --> 05:06.973
He told me about

05:07.240 --> 05:11.024
He told all kinds of fairy tales, I suppose.

05:11.044 --> 05:11.824
But I'm not sure.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.746
He said, he may have told that he was.

05:14.747 --> 05:26.279
Now, I said, do you keep your fantastic library, because Daniel, I think, whether he's led by a fantastic book service, yes, in your home, in your house.

05:27.159 --> 05:33.906
He said, well, yes, but it's so well protected by all the technical means that no one is there.

05:34.173 --> 06:03.150
because and that i can remember i am interested in this uh field of technique or i am a partner in one of the uh he couldn't he couldn't even keep his life he couldn't even keep his life straight uh yeah thank you it was not my favorite good for you but you picked right up on that no but he had the uh

06:04.092 --> 06:20.250
I must say, the courage and the knowledge to buy the great books wherever they came.

06:21.671 --> 06:26.116
Because you need not only money, you know, it also remains courage to spend the money.

06:26.136 --> 06:26.597
That's right.

06:26.697 --> 06:29.600
Easier when it is not only your money, I agree.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.424
But when you are a responsible person, then

06:34.062 --> 06:35.504
It doesn't make much difference.

06:35.524 --> 06:36.185
You know, he loves books.

06:36.205 --> 06:37.167
We have to give him that.

06:37.327 --> 06:37.648
No, no.

06:37.668 --> 06:38.689
Fantastic books.

06:39.651 --> 06:39.751
Yeah.

06:39.791 --> 06:40.632
And well chosen.

06:40.913 --> 06:41.393
Yeah.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.236
I like it.

06:43.717 --> 06:44.118
Yeah.

06:44.178 --> 06:46.121
I had another client.

06:46.141 --> 06:47.963
No, no, no.

06:48.264 --> 06:58.720
I had a client who has a different taste, but sometimes they were in the same

06:59.459 --> 07:06.427
both interested in the same book, and then we always sacrifice one third against the other.

07:07.067 --> 07:23.806
And while I am coming from a country where money is still money and you don't throw away money, I'm much more careful in spending other money, even more.

07:23.886 --> 07:26.108
We need the other's money.

07:27.016 --> 07:30.260
Well, I'm so interested in your own experiences.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.023
Well, come on, but you tell me.

07:33.363 --> 07:34.645
You ask questions.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.026
Okay.

07:36.046 --> 07:39.971
I'm really interested in this trip, this European tradition of bookselling.

07:40.331 --> 07:42.454
I know that you come from a family of booksellers.

07:42.674 --> 07:44.136
My father was a bookseller, yes.

07:44.476 --> 07:50.623
And his brother's... I had his brother, 10 years old.

07:51.444 --> 07:54.728
He would have been, could have been one of great booksellers.

07:55.096 --> 07:58.921
in the world after the war, because he knew everything.

07:58.941 --> 08:01.524
But he was killed.

08:05.269 --> 08:07.291
And his name was Solomon.

08:07.712 --> 08:09.434
How did you spell Solomon?

08:09.454 --> 08:14.460
Like the... King of Israel.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.381
S-O-O.

08:15.401 --> 08:17.744
S-A-L-O-M-O-N.

08:17.824 --> 08:19.647
S-A-L-O-M-O-N.

08:19.707 --> 08:20.988
S-A-L-O-M-O-N.

08:21.048 --> 08:23.051
You say Solomon, you say Solomon.

08:23.071 --> 08:23.972
Solomon.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.683
And he was at 40 during the war?

08:27.023 --> 08:27.504
He was.

08:28.044 --> 08:29.807
He was born from 1900.

08:30.688 --> 08:32.570
So he had already spent some time.

08:32.590 --> 08:43.683
He already had spent some time, and he was the born of that book.

08:44.484 --> 08:47.828
He knew a book before having seen it, or having heard it.

08:48.389 --> 08:48.709
Really?

08:48.989 --> 08:51.192
No, he was, in that respect, was great.

08:53.568 --> 08:56.673
How can you explain he knew a book before he saw it?

08:56.693 --> 08:58.616
I love that story.

08:58.696 --> 09:04.244
Because, well, that's difficult to explain.

09:04.344 --> 09:09.492
A kind of intuition, as the Germans say.

09:10.293 --> 09:12.136
You have it or you don't.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.760
He could smell a good book.

09:16.002 --> 09:22.512
And he was a very self-educated person.

09:23.943 --> 09:28.128
He never stopped reading.

09:28.148 --> 09:29.810
And what were his interests?

09:29.830 --> 09:32.594
In everything he was interested.

09:32.694 --> 09:33.815
An autodidact.

09:33.855 --> 09:34.236
An autodidact.

09:34.997 --> 09:37.540
He was an autodidact.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.901
Was he kind of a hero for you?

09:39.622 --> 09:39.923
No.

09:40.704 --> 09:40.964
No.

09:41.464 --> 09:44.268
But we really got along very well.

09:46.110 --> 09:47.352
He was my bigger brother.

09:48.053 --> 09:49.214
He was big.

09:50.295 --> 09:52.498
I'm from 1919.

09:52.968 --> 10:02.138
1900, so we had 19 years, which, when you are young, is a very, a real difference.

10:03.179 --> 10:09.887
And so, for as long as you have a memory, you remembered your brother had this great knowledge about poetry.

10:09.987 --> 10:12.510
Absolutely, and he was recognized as such.

10:12.730 --> 10:20.899
I mean, the people who knew books, they came to see him.

10:21.436 --> 10:22.637
And this was in Arnhem?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.059
It was in Arnhem.

10:24.099 --> 10:26.942
Later he started a business in Amsterdam.

10:29.425 --> 10:30.907
He was unmarried.

10:32.809 --> 10:33.950
He was the head of the family.

10:36.193 --> 10:39.036
And he learned from your father, you would say?

10:39.156 --> 10:40.778
I think he learned from himself.

10:40.798 --> 10:42.420
My father was a different kind of man.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.763
My father was a well-educated man.

10:44.963 --> 10:47.946
He was a well-educated man.

10:47.966 --> 10:50.149
And his name was, what was his name?

10:50.469 --> 10:51.190
Bernard.

10:51.389 --> 10:55.734
Bernard, my brother's surname is B-M-U-S.

10:56.034 --> 10:56.775
He was Bernard.

10:57.616 --> 11:06.306
It was another Bernard living in the small town of Ireland, so he made a name himself Bernard Marcus.

11:06.586 --> 11:08.808
Marcus was the name of his father.

11:09.229 --> 11:10.070
M-A-R-C-U-S.

11:10.090 --> 11:10.871
So that's B-M.

11:11.451 --> 11:13.574
M-A-R-C-U-S.

11:13.794 --> 11:17.037
And Bernard, B-E-R-N-H-A-R-D?

11:17.118 --> 11:19.320
No H. B-E-R-N-A-R-D.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.071
So your father was very well educated?

11:22.191 --> 11:30.641
He was well educated, but came from a typical Jewish provincial family.

11:31.582 --> 11:40.171
No money, a lot of children, and everybody had to go out to get themselves as young as possible.

11:41.513 --> 11:43.956
How do you suppose your father chose to be a bookseller?

11:46.098 --> 11:49.662
I don't know, but he was born to become a bookseller, absolutely.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.276
Perhaps you can explain a little bit.

11:53.476 --> 11:55.379
He loved books.

11:56.059 --> 11:58.843
He knew books.

11:58.863 --> 12:00.205
He was devoted to books.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.149
He devoted, and that is probably the most important.

12:04.990 --> 12:09.036
He was very devoted to people interested in books.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.043
You see, even books only are not enough.

12:15.263 --> 12:19.108
You have to have some connection with people.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.835
I think that was one of his great gifts.

12:22.796 --> 12:30.406
I've been young enough, I'd say we were, my brother must have told you, we were nine children.

12:31.647 --> 12:32.689
He didn't tell me the number.

12:32.829 --> 12:35.733
But there were nine, four sons and five daughters.

12:36.394 --> 12:38.677
I was one of the youngest, but I was the youngest son.

12:39.818 --> 12:47.188
And when I became 18, for the first time in history, he had a car because I could drive a car.

12:47.658 --> 12:51.222
So I went to a lot of traveling with my father.

12:51.602 --> 12:51.722
18?

12:51.742 --> 12:53.324
18, yeah, 19.

12:53.484 --> 12:58.029
I had to recall from that time earlier in this country.

12:58.049 --> 13:08.100
So in certain seconds of the course, I got my license and the car was built.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.763
And so we went to a lot of traveling together.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.646
Sitting in the car with my father-in-law was reset.

13:13.666 --> 13:16.990
He was going to do everything and he was...

13:17.341 --> 13:22.648
Very much interest in politics and everything that had concerned life and society.

13:24.451 --> 13:28.716
And how did that work into becoming a bookseller?

13:29.097 --> 13:30.699
I think that's what I said.

13:30.719 --> 13:32.902
I think he was born a bookseller.

13:33.002 --> 13:34.805
That is the kind of bookseller.

13:34.825 --> 13:36.707
What kinds of books was he looking for?

13:37.108 --> 13:42.215
He was looking less than mine for the product.

13:42.235 --> 13:45.138
In, let's say, a regular book.

13:45.158 --> 13:45.559
Mine.

13:46.045 --> 13:55.042
He was interested in any kind of book.

13:55.282 --> 14:02.596
But he was the man who formed in Ireland, wanted to create rare book shops in the world.

14:02.736 --> 14:06.262
And nobody can talk me out of that or buy that.

14:06.843 --> 14:08.847
But that was correct.

14:10.531 --> 14:15.257
We have some very good spies in Germany in the years just before Hitler.

14:15.277 --> 14:15.638
Who did?

14:16.018 --> 14:17.020
Your father?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.522
No, my father.

14:18.542 --> 14:19.643
This is Solomon.

14:19.663 --> 14:20.484
Yeah, Solomon.

14:20.504 --> 14:28.054
And he wrote in Germany the Depression of the First World War and the Depression.

14:28.355 --> 14:31.279
And a lot of these noble families were in the money.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.965
And he succeeded in buying tremendous money.

14:36.822 --> 14:59.023
a library from castles, a tremendous eye member, and I was 13, 14 years old, 12 years old, that I helped to unload a wagon, a train wagon load full of books, and not one later than 1750.

14:59.123 --> 14:59.423
Wow.

14:59.944 --> 15:00.584
That's where it was.

15:01.585 --> 15:03.387
Then thousands of books came in.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.751
Who was selling them?

15:04.771 --> 15:06.833
The owners of the castles?

15:06.893 --> 15:08.355
No, the owners of the castles.

15:09.196 --> 15:10.497
Because of the depression in Germany?

15:10.517 --> 15:12.620
The depression and the inflation before.

15:14.321 --> 15:16.063
So this was a way to get money?

15:16.344 --> 15:17.165
To get some money.

15:17.785 --> 15:24.853
I don't think that there were hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars if that was a question of tens of thousands of dollars.

15:25.954 --> 15:29.678
Because books were not in very...

15:30.772 --> 15:39.226
And of course, when you need food, you'll do anything... Well, then you'll need to have your roof repaired or whatever.

15:40.107 --> 15:44.314
And these books came out of castles all over... All over Germany.

15:44.394 --> 15:48.240
I think they need some parts.

15:48.794 --> 15:55.442
Did he go into Germany himself, or did he have people... No, he had some, like I said, agents.

15:56.123 --> 16:07.076
And then he got news that there might be a possibility, and then he took the train and went to Portugal, didn't.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.199
And then, of course, these books came to Arnhem

16:09.584 --> 16:19.958
I was early, that's why I was waiting outside.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.821
I couldn't.

16:22.922 --> 16:23.763
Outside.

16:24.143 --> 16:26.326
I was just here a few minutes early, that's all.

16:26.366 --> 16:27.067
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:27.087 --> 16:27.768
No, no, no.

16:27.888 --> 16:29.350
I'm sorry, I thought I saw you outside.

16:29.370 --> 16:30.171
I guess I didn't go.

16:30.892 --> 16:31.813
No, no, no, okay.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.516
But it was easy to find.

16:33.536 --> 16:34.677
300 meters.

16:35.178 --> 16:37.000
You only helped him?

16:37.040 --> 16:37.280
Yes.

16:37.721 --> 16:38.402
Oh, yes.

16:38.682 --> 16:39.203
How was it?

16:39.402 --> 16:41.024
It's wonderful.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.727
It's beautiful.

16:43.747 --> 16:45.830
Coffee, tea, something cold.

16:45.950 --> 16:48.493
Something cold, maybe water or something would be good.

16:49.474 --> 16:50.856
Food, juice or something.

16:51.156 --> 16:52.818
Something cold, anything.

16:52.959 --> 16:57.544
Anything cold.

16:57.564 --> 17:03.752
So we were talking about your brother bringing books to ICAM.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.853
Bringing books to ICAM.

17:05.761 --> 17:10.586
And if I'm not easy to sell, first, he was not a cataloging man.

17:11.526 --> 17:12.567
That was his weakness.

17:12.748 --> 17:14.169
That was his weakness.

17:14.189 --> 17:24.419
Probably his strength as well because, therefore, he could kind of regulate the sales and he needed the money he sold when he didn't get the books.

17:25.460 --> 17:32.106
So the books were heating up in warehouses in Ireland.

17:32.339 --> 17:34.281
You had several warehouses?

17:34.301 --> 17:36.203
At a certain moment, yes.

17:36.903 --> 17:39.285
How many books do you think he had at a given point?

17:39.446 --> 17:45.271
I took an old book because he did a whole kind of books.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.052
A hundred thousand?

17:46.072 --> 17:47.353
A hundred thousand, a hundred thousand.

17:47.373 --> 17:47.573
Wow.

17:48.214 --> 17:49.295
But not only books.

17:49.615 --> 17:50.476
He had a good taste.

17:50.616 --> 17:52.598
He didn't buy everything.

17:52.618 --> 17:59.124
I mean, and then he bought and then, like, say, a lot like that, the first thing he wanted to get rid of the books he didn't like.

17:59.164 --> 18:01.806
So it remained with better ones.

18:03.828 --> 18:28.401
and i remember when we had i mean talking uh particularly 18th century uh bird books flower books houses travel books travel books whatever so but you said he wasn't much of a camera but he knew the books he knew the books

18:30.322 --> 18:38.435
One of my dear colleagues I remember in Germany was Domislav.

18:38.576 --> 18:54.642
Domislav was by far the greatest antiquarian dealer in Germany, but only known to a few people because he never had a publishing title in his own name.

18:55.128 --> 18:56.409
What was his name again?

18:56.429 --> 18:57.430
Dominslav.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.794
Helmut was the first name.

19:00.814 --> 19:02.015
D-O-M-I-Z-L-A-F-F.

19:03.156 --> 19:05.859
Dominslav.

19:06.940 --> 19:07.901
Dominslav.

19:08.822 --> 19:12.706
And he was in Germany?

19:12.786 --> 19:13.947
He was in Germany, Munich.

19:14.508 --> 19:20.574
One of the most respected and grand dealers in Germany in the world.

19:21.235 --> 19:22.276
Never published capital.

19:22.756 --> 19:24.578
He worked for...

19:24.963 --> 19:41.417
A part of the Rosenthal's, who had the business in Lugano in years before the war.

19:42.798 --> 19:50.265
And he was working there, and the Rosenthal was a demonstration of herbers.

19:51.846 --> 19:54.328
And he did a description of that capital.

19:54.865 --> 19:57.669
I wonder why.

19:58.009 --> 19:59.751
Did anyone ever ask him why?

19:59.771 --> 20:01.474
Or he didn't have to, I guess.

20:01.494 --> 20:02.775
So he didn't have a shot.

20:03.096 --> 20:07.141
He was living, holding his book in his own apartment in Munich.

20:09.064 --> 20:10.866
It was a little bit difficult to buy from him.

20:12.308 --> 20:20.539
I mean, I came there, and I was a young man, and we know he's, by name at least, because of my brother.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.623
And when

20:25.662 --> 20:33.830
I got easily enthusiastic about a certain book, and he liked me, so he did sell me now and then every book.

20:34.311 --> 20:41.258
But it was very difficult to persuade him to sell you a book if he didn't want to.

20:41.278 --> 20:41.458
Why?

20:41.518 --> 20:42.940
Because he wanted to keep the books?

20:42.980 --> 20:48.485
He wanted to keep the books, because in the middle of the money, and he wanted to make sure they were going to the right place.

20:48.685 --> 20:53.030
And of course he paid the scholarship.

20:53.070 --> 20:53.731
Was he Jewish?

20:54.151 --> 20:55.112
No, not at all.

20:55.649 --> 21:02.436
He had been to Sweden, because one of the bookstores in Sweden was very poor in your time.

21:02.456 --> 21:05.218
It was Billy Eilman of Sandberg.

21:06.820 --> 21:07.981
He was a good bookstores.

21:08.001 --> 21:08.862
He came from Germany.

21:09.543 --> 21:22.315
And it was Domislav who helped him, who assisted him in taking a refuge in countries who built him

21:23.020 --> 21:27.066
I think to the Dutch, the German-Danish border.

21:29.870 --> 21:42.429
There is a great tradition, a European tradition in bookseller, a scholar, bookseller who really, as you're describing your older brother and of course yourself, the people who really understand the books.

21:43.190 --> 21:46.334
It's not just a question of being in business.

21:46.434 --> 21:50.901
I think it achieves a certain kind of

21:51.235 --> 21:53.859
Yeah, it is a cultural function.

21:53.879 --> 22:16.450
It is, but that's only true, let's say, in non-German countries, because in the German countries, I mean, that was that you couldn't settle as a Uxad or an entrepreneur without having, and how do you call it?

22:17.054 --> 22:21.078
permission, or a grant, or no, not a grant.

22:21.098 --> 22:21.678
A license?

22:21.738 --> 22:22.439
A license.

22:24.020 --> 22:28.824
And you could only get a license when you have a certain study.

22:29.325 --> 22:30.246
To become a bookseller?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.086
To become a bookseller.

22:31.106 --> 22:31.487
Is that right?

22:31.507 --> 22:32.167
I didn't know that.

22:32.408 --> 22:34.710
No, no, because even today it's true.

22:34.730 --> 22:35.670
You have to have a license?

22:35.751 --> 22:46.420
You can't be a rare book dealer, or a auctioneer, or a regular bookseller.

22:46.703 --> 22:50.377
when you are not the nice thing to do so.

22:51.421 --> 22:53.308
So you have to have a certain education?

22:53.348 --> 22:57.945
That is something that isn't true in Holland.

22:58.634 --> 23:00.116
It's not true in Holland.

23:00.136 --> 23:02.440
It isn't true in France.

23:03.481 --> 23:04.423
It isn't true in England.

23:05.224 --> 23:10.412
I mean, when you are in the United States, when you want to establish yourself as a bookseller, you open it.

23:10.612 --> 23:13.016
You open a shop and hang up the same.

23:13.036 --> 23:15.900
Or you just start having three books.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.201
That's right.

23:16.361 --> 23:17.283
And calling people.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.229
So the Germans have a system.

23:21.669 --> 23:22.711
A system.

23:23.392 --> 23:24.754
That's for everything.

23:24.774 --> 23:25.635
That's for everything.

23:25.756 --> 23:26.076
Yes.

23:27.423 --> 23:43.426
Of course, you know, Barney Rosenthal has written about the Jewish booksellers who left Germany and brought their skill, you know, to North America, to England, and how... That's not true.

23:43.547 --> 23:53.481
I mean, it's... I mean, the English booksellers, the English booksellers, the English trades, for many, many, many years...

23:54.338 --> 23:56.180
Very, very important.

23:56.200 --> 24:03.848
You see a man like Horst coming from Leipzig to London, not the other way it comes.

24:04.448 --> 24:15.640
And firms like Max, Bosch, Edwards, Francis, Edwards, in the United States, sailing in the 19th century already.

24:17.362 --> 24:20.125
And Rosenbach was pretty important.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.626
Rosenbach was pretty important.

24:21.666 --> 24:23.468
Smith was important.

24:24.258 --> 24:51.717
came before him but uh but it is interesting though that there weren't maybe 50 booksellers who i'm not saying they influenced the whole trade but they certainly were very influential but still like today it's the same there is in the world uh book book selling in the world is a lot of small dealers second hand books

24:52.186 --> 25:00.016
call it, and sometimes an old book, not necessarily important old book, but sometimes there are thousands of them.

25:02.179 --> 25:19.341
Then there are, in the world, a good number of leaders, even, let's say, the more important book, whether that is a book of yesterday or a book of 500 years ago, that is not of any importance.

25:20.283 --> 25:48.231
But, and then there have to be very few, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like

25:48.650 --> 25:56.618
I'm going to see Chiesa next month.

25:57.258 --> 25:59.280
He hasn't been well.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.501
He sent me a letter.

26:00.521 --> 26:01.342
He said, please come.

26:01.663 --> 26:05.666
I hope I'm okay when you arrive.

26:06.307 --> 26:09.770
His letter, he said something like that.

26:11.352 --> 26:15.636
So,

26:15.903 --> 26:19.588
Just to finish the story about your brother, your brother didn't survive the war.

26:19.828 --> 26:42.399
No, he was... My wife and I, we escaped to Switzerland by... We had a special line that was known to my parents-in-law.

26:42.419 --> 26:43.280
A line?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.121
A line.

26:44.489 --> 26:46.151
That's a smugglerous line.

26:46.332 --> 26:46.612
OK.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.114
As an escape route.

26:48.134 --> 26:50.938
An escape route, yeah.

26:50.958 --> 26:59.389
But when we were in Brussels, we knew that there the line was going to be cut.

26:59.510 --> 27:03.255
We were the last to make use of it.

27:03.275 --> 27:09.383
So when I arrived in Switzerland, I sent in cables to

27:09.818 --> 27:31.101
books arrived well but further shipments impossible that's all that was that was from switzerland to here well from when we arrived in switzerland

27:31.823 --> 27:32.344
To whom?

27:32.364 --> 27:33.365
Who did you say that they were?

27:33.505 --> 27:38.493
To a friendly bookseller who drove my family to my family.

27:38.513 --> 27:40.776
So you were saying the books arrived, meaning yourself?

27:40.796 --> 27:41.217
Yeah, yeah.

27:41.497 --> 27:42.479
And your wife?

27:42.779 --> 27:46.965
No further shippings possible.

27:46.985 --> 27:56.038
And then the first thing we knew was that my old brother, together with my parents, went up the same route.

27:56.058 --> 28:00.765
And there were siblings because their design was cut.

28:00.906 --> 28:01.206
I knew that.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.994
And this was about 1942.

28:06.094 --> 28:07.877
And this is your brother and your parents?

28:09.239 --> 28:10.921
My parents and me.

28:10.941 --> 28:11.963
So your wife's parents?

28:12.003 --> 28:13.906
My wife's parents.

28:13.926 --> 28:14.887
And that was 1942.

28:15.147 --> 28:17.771
And then you also lost some other members of your family, I think.

28:17.791 --> 28:21.537
Well, there are other members, yeah.

28:21.557 --> 28:24.381
But the rest of the tragedy evolved to the family.

28:26.003 --> 28:30.670
And so after the war, you came back to...

28:31.072 --> 28:32.955
Three of us brothers who came back.

28:33.717 --> 28:36.923
Yourself, and brother Max.

28:36.943 --> 28:45.078
And I had a third brother who was arrested by the Germans, not being a Jew.

28:45.198 --> 28:48.103
He was in a mixed marriage.

28:48.123 --> 28:49.145
I don't know.

28:49.165 --> 28:53.333
Some married to a non-Jewish wife.

28:55.473 --> 29:14.862
He was arrested for going illegal, going against the Germans.

29:14.982 --> 29:20.130
He was convicted for being against Germans.

29:20.448 --> 29:27.617
was being a prisoner sent to one of the Germany's constitution times.

29:27.637 --> 29:46.320
But being a prisoner, and though he had a life, impossibly, they didn't kill him because he had, he was, he had a prison sentence, so they had to keep him alive because all of that was destroyed.

29:47.515 --> 29:48.476
And so he survived.

29:48.736 --> 29:49.577
And he survived.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.579
And what's his name?

29:52.100 --> 29:52.741
Bob.

29:53.201 --> 29:53.501
Bob?

29:53.782 --> 29:54.222
Bill Mead?

29:54.242 --> 29:54.623
Bill Mead.

29:56.765 --> 29:59.047
And so after the war, the three of you started?

29:59.167 --> 29:59.988
Well, we started all over again.

30:00.008 --> 30:04.793
All this business was completely rubbed out.

30:05.054 --> 30:05.794
There was nothing.

30:06.115 --> 30:10.519
When I say nothing, there was nothing.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.621
So you went and you lost?

30:12.702 --> 30:14.063
We lost the greatest success.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.238
Part of our book was .

30:17.338 --> 30:19.642
So they were destroyed.

30:20.062 --> 30:28.256
And a lot of them were destroyed, but we were under control by the Germans.

30:28.336 --> 30:32.002
And they showed all the books we had, or a great part of the book.

30:32.022 --> 30:34.106
So when we came back, we had nothing.

30:34.787 --> 30:37.992
I was with the Canadian units coming back.

30:39.271 --> 31:03.456
and you said you were you were serving 44 and oh so you came but you served in the second so you served with the canadian army i was by the canadian army and uh what year did you did you did you join up with the canadian 44. and that's the army

31:03.706 --> 31:05.829
I joined the Dutch Army.

31:06.010 --> 31:15.364
They were just coming over from England to France, and being a Dutch Army, having been in the Dutch Army before the war.

31:16.246 --> 31:18.009
Thank you so much.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.437
So you came back, you fought?

31:23.597 --> 31:29.246
I came back, you know, and over the Rhine, in St.

31:29.266 --> 31:31.570
Papakirin, over the Rhine, back to the two months.

31:34.722 --> 31:50.306
So when I landed in my region, just north of Ireland, I took my car and went, and that was a big mistake I made, I did, went to Ireland.

31:50.326 --> 31:55.914
It was just liberated the town of the city of Ireland.

31:55.934 --> 32:01.863
And when I was there, believe me or not, I was the only person there.

32:01.883 --> 32:03.025
I was absolutely the opposite.

32:03.595 --> 32:04.757
All the residents were gone.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.962
They had evacuated the town.

32:09.203 --> 32:11.166
Not only evacuated, but they took everything.

32:12.288 --> 32:14.391
They could use oil.

32:14.411 --> 32:15.112
All the furniture.

32:16.474 --> 32:21.702
All the, the, the, the, the femorails, the electrical wiring.

32:21.802 --> 32:23.605
Everything, everything they took.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.448
It was like what we call a ghost town.

32:25.468 --> 32:26.209
It was a ghost town.

32:26.309 --> 32:27.411
Not what you call it.

32:27.511 --> 32:29.614
It was a ghost town.

32:29.634 --> 32:31.577
It was a ghost town.

32:32.722 --> 32:34.604
And this was 45 now?

32:34.784 --> 32:36.646
Oh, 44.

32:37.026 --> 32:40.969
April of 45.

32:40.989 --> 32:46.775
Wow.

32:47.635 --> 32:50.738
That's very dramatic, I have to tell you.

32:51.058 --> 32:52.760
Yes.

32:53.140 --> 32:58.345
Okay.

32:58.365 --> 33:01.868
And did you go into...

33:02.101 --> 33:04.144
books on the same day.

33:05.146 --> 33:11.536
And I found a need of the most important books.

33:13.559 --> 33:27.501
But having later, without any cover, the Dutch winter, the Dutch spring from September through April and the paper.

33:29.223 --> 33:30.285
And there was one

33:31.868 --> 33:34.491
a heap of wet paper.

33:34.511 --> 33:35.852
And it was outside?

33:35.892 --> 33:37.774
It was outside.

33:37.794 --> 33:41.017
I mean, no, the roof was... Oh, the roof was destroyed.

33:41.217 --> 33:45.601
Destroyed, and... There was a heap of... a mass of pulp.

33:45.621 --> 33:50.066
A mass of pulp.

33:50.086 --> 33:50.946
And what was your feeling?

33:51.987 --> 33:53.068
I think it cried.

33:55.591 --> 33:55.691
Yeah.

33:55.711 --> 33:57.232
It's very, very dramatic.

33:59.234 --> 33:59.935
And so...

34:01.366 --> 34:02.327
You decided then?

34:02.367 --> 34:17.865
And so you established yourself down here in Amsterdam.

34:17.885 --> 34:28.116
And tell me how, if you can, you know, if you've got the time, how did you go from nothing to becoming... No.

34:30.087 --> 34:34.914
His English was not... He was three years old.

34:35.735 --> 34:42.926
In fact, he said Nico all the time.

34:42.986 --> 34:49.916
What happened is that when we came back, we hadn't done anything.

34:49.936 --> 34:54.803
The other thing we had was a little experience.

34:54.823 --> 34:58.508
Because in a way, I've never been trained to become a real book dealer.

34:58.775 --> 35:01.318
As I said, we were four brothers.

35:01.338 --> 35:02.919
I was the youngest.

35:02.939 --> 35:05.321
And I came to my father's bookshop.

35:07.924 --> 35:09.886
The royal registry was in it.

35:10.627 --> 35:16.132
So my father decided, if it's good for you, you go and do the regular book trade.

35:16.152 --> 35:22.939
And later I started also on the education.

35:22.959 --> 35:25.221
I'm going to just take a picture while you talk, if you don't mind.

35:25.488 --> 35:30.033
Well, I hope it will come out as well because I am not pretty gentle.

35:30.053 --> 35:32.116
Well, don't worry.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.458
My pictures are good.

35:33.478 --> 35:34.799
Okay, you don't have a use to it.

35:34.819 --> 35:37.002
You said gentle madness, all the pictures are good.

35:39.305 --> 35:39.405
Okay.

35:39.425 --> 35:40.806
Well, I'm worried.

35:40.826 --> 35:43.209
Okay, go ahead.

35:43.229 --> 35:50.098
This is rewinding now.

35:50.218 --> 35:50.959
It's rewinding.

35:51.199 --> 35:52.120
Oh, yeah.

35:53.264 --> 35:58.834
You had three brothers, and you said you were the youngest, and you didn't.

35:59.134 --> 36:01.338
When we came back, I mean, at least we had.

36:01.478 --> 36:06.026
I never, ever be a rare book man.

36:07.248 --> 36:16.504
Of course, I've been grown up in a family where rare books were daily bread and butter, but I've never had any training.

36:19.184 --> 36:25.212
I had one for the economy, and it's a regular bookseller, modern books.

36:25.232 --> 36:36.248
That was a kind of... Actually, I mean, I had to buy them, which I passed, that's okay, but I never had any experience in being a bookseller.

36:36.268 --> 36:40.133
So then I came back, I wasn't a great bookseller.

36:40.153 --> 36:42.677
My brother, who was three years old, he had more experience.

36:42.717 --> 36:46.963
He worked some years in my part of business, and...

36:47.939 --> 36:55.046
He had some knowledge of... He had some knowledge, more knowledge at least than I had, and so he put on things that he did.

36:56.808 --> 37:06.559
But having not one old book and having no, not one penny, he had to start out somewhere.

37:07.179 --> 37:10.503
And then he started being in a modern book shop.

37:11.524 --> 37:12.725
In modern books, you mean?

37:13.005 --> 37:15.448
In modern books.

37:16.019 --> 37:41.875
started coming in modern books and we were helped then by the association of booksellers your brother did say that the association um gave you some stock to get started yeah the yes and that he said said that when you opened there was a whole queue of people who was always

37:42.800 --> 37:48.346
And I will say that for some years we had a thriving trade in modern books.

37:50.328 --> 38:00.058
We seem to have had the right taste and the right appeal for clients, and we had the most interesting clients in Amsterdam.

38:00.078 --> 38:11.029
The book collectors and the authors and the theatre people, that's very much nothing from the forties per year.

38:11.249 --> 38:12.030
Certainly no more.

38:13.394 --> 38:17.341
And at what point did you decide to move into the area?

38:17.361 --> 38:18.162
No, we always had.

38:18.182 --> 38:21.728
That was always our aim.

38:21.768 --> 38:31.745
The goal was to get back to what you... So we bought, piece by piece, we bought old books.

38:31.766 --> 38:34.390
And where were you finding the books at this time after the war?

38:34.876 --> 38:47.719
So you really couldn't buy for stock so much?

38:47.960 --> 38:48.701
No, we couldn't.

38:48.941 --> 38:50.905
We couldn't buy for selling either.

38:51.466 --> 38:59.280
We simply didn't have the money to make the purchase.

39:00.779 --> 39:04.202
So very slowly you... I thought it was an interesting story.

39:04.242 --> 39:07.285
It was an interesting story.

39:07.305 --> 39:10.187
I think it is an interesting story.

39:10.347 --> 39:11.749
I think everything is interesting.

39:11.769 --> 39:13.230
No, no, it's not.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.692
But it was interesting.

39:16.733 --> 39:23.539
I've been, as I told you, a refugee in Switzerland.

39:25.140 --> 39:30.465
I made a report to the Dutch government about... Like I said, I was another bookseller.

39:31.087 --> 39:39.561
after the situation of the Dutch... No, it was a scientific book in Holland after the war.

39:39.661 --> 39:41.705
The situation of the scientific book?

39:42.606 --> 39:44.569
In Holland, modern book in Holland, for a student.

39:44.790 --> 39:45.411
I see, yes.

39:45.451 --> 39:45.731
Yes?

39:46.012 --> 39:46.352
Okay.

39:46.633 --> 39:50.038
Okay, that was... Traditionally, it was German.

39:51.180 --> 39:57.651
I decided that after the war, the first years after the war, the German...

39:58.103 --> 40:05.693
input of books for this purpose would be no, which was correct.

40:05.713 --> 40:09.398
So that was my presumption.

40:11.941 --> 40:26.119
And I decided that being in Switzerland, which was a good idea to check, Switzerland could provide German books for Dutch children.

40:27.500 --> 40:37.572
That was delivered to the embassy in Berlin and sent to London.

40:37.592 --> 40:43.379
But the Dutch government was there.

40:43.400 --> 40:56.055
And a few months later, they came back that the idea was to have the hospital.

40:57.470 --> 41:04.397
Swiss publishers.

41:04.417 --> 41:06.358
Very good, excellent story.

41:07.980 --> 41:14.226
So you perceived this need?

41:14.786 --> 41:14.907
Yes.

41:16.568 --> 41:17.929
And that was the end.

41:17.949 --> 41:20.031
I made a report, because it was fine.

41:20.051 --> 41:27.038
It was then turned under the cane, and I forgot everything about it, until September 45.

41:27.541 --> 41:30.525
Peace was back in Holland.

41:30.545 --> 41:41.159
I got a letter on the Dutch government, whether I was willing to go to Switzerland and make a serious support.

41:42.521 --> 41:54.797
And I was invited to go this then-or-righty good friend of mine in Amsterdam to go together.

41:56.195 --> 41:59.859
Some of the money we got.

41:59.879 --> 42:02.622
That bond cured Sudan and all this chaos.

42:04.544 --> 42:05.645
We've been four of us.

42:06.666 --> 42:07.487
He's one.

42:08.428 --> 42:08.949
I won.

42:09.710 --> 42:13.494
And he worked hard for six weeks.

42:13.514 --> 42:19.060
But while working hard, I was going around to burn.

42:20.041 --> 42:25.527
And in one of the windows, show windows, I don't know.

42:26.063 --> 42:28.005
a bookshop in Bern.

42:29.006 --> 42:42.180
So I went into the shop.

42:42.821 --> 42:50.249
You always had to understand that you didn't know I had one friend.

42:50.309 --> 42:52.071
Getting a simple meal.

42:53.603 --> 43:01.972
So I went into the chateaus in the hall of the lady, and she asked what I wanted, so I said, I think we can do that in my book, may I have a look at it?

43:01.992 --> 43:02.833
So I think, sir.

43:03.333 --> 43:07.318
So she showed me the book, and I said, yes, that's what interests me.

43:07.778 --> 43:11.522
We have more rare, important books like this.

43:11.542 --> 43:12.824
She said, yes, I have more.

43:12.844 --> 43:15.046
Would you like to see him?

43:15.066 --> 43:17.288
I said, yes, I would like to see him.

43:17.308 --> 43:20.992
And then she comes with four or five really great, great books.

43:22.814 --> 43:23.475
Even today,

43:24.974 --> 43:31.361
So, do you remember what?

43:32.322 --> 43:33.764
Yes, sir.

43:33.924 --> 43:43.074
I think in this respect, then the problem was I had no money.

43:43.935 --> 43:47.779
First question, a few thousand Swiss rings altogether.

43:47.819 --> 43:49.942
Several thousand Swiss rings?

43:49.982 --> 43:51.764
Some thousand Swiss rings.

43:51.804 --> 43:52.905
So the money was not

43:53.240 --> 43:56.467
But books were not then all that expensive either.

43:58.671 --> 44:13.341
So I looked at the woman and said, do you trust me?

44:13.912 --> 44:15.534
So that's in what language?

44:16.175 --> 44:16.695
In German.

44:16.876 --> 44:17.556
In German.

44:19.459 --> 44:22.042
Do you trust me?

44:22.402 --> 44:23.083
Yes, why not?

44:25.206 --> 44:35.719
So I asked her, would you trust me enough to let me have the books for 24 hours.

44:38.802 --> 44:39.724
I have no money here.

44:40.905 --> 44:43.328
I bring them back within 24 hours.

44:43.949 --> 44:48.755
Or I'll pay you, would you ask me?

44:48.795 --> 44:50.036
Would you ask me?

44:55.723 --> 45:11.982
I took the train to Geneva, same hour, and so took the books to Kendi, one of the great books I was really nice, Kendi, William S. Kendi, K-U-M-D-I-G, okay.

45:12.299 --> 45:14.862
He sold him two books.

45:16.124 --> 45:23.914
Among the books were Ptolemy, 1511, but a fantastic book.

45:23.934 --> 45:24.335
1511?

45:24.836 --> 45:24.976
Uh-huh.

45:25.016 --> 45:27.739
The Danish 1511.

45:27.759 --> 45:32.906
There was a very fine copy of it, a great book.

45:34.288 --> 45:38.053
The first book was in London.

45:38.843 --> 45:52.442
There is Versaceus, there's a link in the media video, there's a B-E-Z... B-S-A-L-I-U-S... I have a Versaceus in Gentle Madness, Castle Norman has it.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.645
It's coming up for sale, do you know that?

45:55.206 --> 45:55.566
Yes, sir?

45:55.907 --> 45:57.028
It's coming up for sale?

45:57.429 --> 45:58.150
Yes, he died.

45:58.310 --> 45:59.291
It's coming up.

45:59.972 --> 46:00.653
I didn't know that.

46:01.374 --> 46:03.417
So they asked someone who was going to come up.

46:03.970 --> 46:05.072
I'll check it out.

46:05.393 --> 46:10.201
I was hoping they'd keep the collection, but that's what happens.

46:10.221 --> 46:10.582
It's good.

46:10.602 --> 46:11.223
It's going back.

46:11.804 --> 46:19.919
When are they going to do that, do you know?

46:20.419 --> 46:23.325
The first one will be in the early next year.

46:23.465 --> 46:24.246
Okay, good.

46:24.266 --> 46:26.651
I'll roll.

46:26.811 --> 46:27.652
I'll do it well.

46:27.873 --> 46:28.594
I'll do it well.

46:29.030 --> 46:30.231
Because he's in my book.

46:30.632 --> 46:33.214
For sure he is.

46:33.795 --> 46:36.157
I have a picture of him with Veselius.

46:37.178 --> 46:38.179
It was his favorite book.

46:38.960 --> 46:39.320
Of course.

46:39.461 --> 46:41.643
He believes he has the presentation property.

46:41.683 --> 46:42.944
I won't know about that.

46:43.505 --> 46:45.987
It should be very interesting, because I write about it at length.

46:46.047 --> 46:46.728
Well, I know.

46:48.190 --> 46:51.793
So I knew what you wrote about it.

46:51.873 --> 46:53.695
So one of the books was in Veselius.

46:53.735 --> 46:55.577
No, it was Veselius, but the English didn't change.

46:55.878 --> 47:06.071
It's a book that's published in England, and I'm going to say to my man, it's called Gemini, G-E-M-I-N-I.

47:06.091 --> 47:12.940
Some later than 43, I think it was 54 or so.

47:12.960 --> 47:17.987
These are spectacular books.

47:18.254 --> 47:32.397
But the famous copy I've seen since of one of the great books on this colony, that was a book by a man called, a French book, published in Lyon, 1557 or so.

47:32.417 --> 47:39.368
A man called B-A-S-S-E-N-T-Y-N-E.

47:40.343 --> 47:48.054
I can't believe this story.

47:50.938 --> 48:02.134
That's three.

48:03.917 --> 48:07.482
We'll get to that.

48:07.816 --> 48:11.520
Then I went to Lausanne, but it was not a great bookseller.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.300
Same day, right?

48:12.341 --> 48:13.101
You go for it.

48:13.121 --> 48:13.782
Yeah, of course.

48:13.842 --> 48:22.310
I only had one for hours.

48:22.330 --> 48:23.171
Yes.

48:23.652 --> 48:31.880
There's a special thing you need.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.544
To know much, everybody can learn.

48:35.984 --> 48:36.945
Yes, sir.

48:37.212 --> 48:41.096
He has a special feeling for something, for many things.

48:41.116 --> 48:49.826
And I think when he was describing his brother, he was also describing himself, his older brother, about the feel for the books, that you can't teach it.

48:50.407 --> 48:54.571
That's it, that's what I'm talking about, yes.

48:54.671 --> 49:00.558
I often wonder what would have happened if he would have stayed alive and we could have worked together.

49:00.578 --> 49:04.502
It would have been a disaster.

49:05.174 --> 49:06.415
be fighting all the time.

49:07.116 --> 49:07.176
Oh.

49:07.717 --> 49:09.799
No, or you could have built up.

49:09.939 --> 49:12.341
A great empire.

49:12.481 --> 49:13.302
Yeah.

49:16.025 --> 49:17.626
Absolutely.

49:17.646 --> 49:20.870
But that's really OK.

49:20.890 --> 49:25.154
So you had, so then you went to Lausanne.

49:25.174 --> 49:30.639
To Lausanne and stole the book to Nicholas Roche.

49:30.660 --> 49:31.881
Nicholas, and I see.

49:32.201 --> 49:34.904
And Nicholas, yeah, I'm not Nicholas.

49:34.924 --> 49:35.164
Roche.

49:35.498 --> 49:47.478
And did you know them or did you just walk in?

49:47.498 --> 49:50.082
Yeah, because I wasn't in Geneva.

49:50.603 --> 49:53.548
Anyway, I've been very kind to me, I must say.

49:53.568 --> 49:54.790
So I was Nicholas Roche.

49:56.153 --> 49:57.675
They were okay for some reason.

49:57.695 --> 50:03.624
They always treated me like a man, like somebody.

50:03.985 --> 50:04.766
A colleague.

50:04.786 --> 50:06.669
A colleague.

50:06.689 --> 50:08.572
I was so young in those days.

50:08.592 --> 50:08.933
You were?

50:10.174 --> 50:12.258
I was three, four years old.

50:12.278 --> 50:14.661
I've never been in the rare book trade in any way.

50:14.681 --> 50:15.483
Well, you were now.

50:16.584 --> 50:17.285
Right now you were.

50:17.305 --> 50:19.188
At this point in time you were.

50:19.369 --> 50:22.954
That was the first old book I laid my hand on.

50:25.803 --> 50:29.208
And then... And which book did you sell to Roche?

50:29.349 --> 50:30.811
I sold the Basantin to Roche.

50:31.252 --> 50:31.632
The which?

50:31.712 --> 50:32.494
The Basantin.

50:32.974 --> 50:34.356
Oh, the Basantin to Roche.

50:34.417 --> 50:34.517
Okay.

50:34.597 --> 50:47.677
And then I had one book left, and now I'm not sure, and I went to Zurich because I had to be there on time.

50:47.717 --> 50:49.380
So I went off early in the morning

50:49.816 --> 50:53.962
went to Geneva, which is two others, to an artifact train.

50:54.062 --> 50:55.764
So you went to Geneva for it?

50:55.784 --> 50:58.167
Yeah, and first to Geneva, so to .

50:58.888 --> 51:00.631
Went to Los Angeles.

51:00.751 --> 51:02.433
Surrey had one book left.

51:02.453 --> 51:14.970
Went to Surrey, Geneva, Los Angeles, Surrey, and then back to Bern, where I can go in the mid-back.

51:14.990 --> 51:15.251
Okay.

51:15.271 --> 51:16.853
So did you sell a book in Zurich?

51:17.221 --> 51:18.022
As I was concerned.

51:18.042 --> 51:18.503
To whom?

51:18.663 --> 51:20.426
I think that was to Laos, yeah.

51:21.688 --> 51:24.712
That was the firm of Erwin Rosenthal, I was talking about.

51:25.253 --> 51:25.734
Oh, really?

51:26.155 --> 51:26.936
So, Rosenthal?

51:27.537 --> 51:28.839
Rosenthal.

51:28.939 --> 51:30.822
Dr. Erwin Rosenthal.

51:31.022 --> 51:31.423
I-R-W-N.

51:32.524 --> 51:35.248
How do you spell his name, Erwin?

51:36.691 --> 51:37.211
I-R-W-I-N.

51:37.392 --> 51:37.953
E-R.

51:38.594 --> 51:39.895
W. And Rosenthal?

51:40.456 --> 51:42.399
Rosenthal.

51:42.419 --> 51:42.620
Rosenthal.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.523
And do you remember what that book was?

51:44.603 --> 51:46.165
I think it was Jim.

51:46.550 --> 51:48.091
I think so, yeah.

51:49.092 --> 51:55.639
And they paid me cash, you see, because I had to be paid for it.

51:55.919 --> 52:02.806
So I went to the... To the woman.

52:03.747 --> 52:04.988
And paid her money.

52:05.849 --> 52:07.010
And you made a profit, of course.

52:07.030 --> 52:09.973
I made a profit, and then we had Muslims tested them.

52:10.833 --> 52:15.578
No, not to be forgotten, because suddenly they had the money.

52:16.537 --> 52:23.065
And together, four of us, we treated ourselves with a fantastic deal.

52:23.485 --> 52:25.487
First glass wines and everything.

52:26.068 --> 52:29.472
Now, did you have enough money to get started now and buy some books, do you think?

52:29.492 --> 52:30.793
No, that was the question.

52:30.813 --> 52:32.676
I gave them a few thousand.

52:33.316 --> 52:33.436
Right.

52:33.517 --> 52:34.137
It was money.

52:35.219 --> 52:37.221
Do you remember the name of the woman you bought from?

52:37.241 --> 52:37.421
No.

52:38.182 --> 52:38.963
You can't remember her name?

52:38.983 --> 52:40.104
No, I can't remember my name.

52:40.184 --> 52:41.346
It was not the woman.

52:41.566 --> 52:45.210
She was acting for a Swiss firm, but I can't remember the name of the firm.

52:45.967 --> 52:54.495
I can't visualize the shop, the window, but I can't remember the name of it.

52:54.515 --> 52:58.799
Which is almost, was it, was it, did it look like it was once an important store, or just a store?

52:58.879 --> 53:07.887
No, it was, we had all kinds of books, and in the middle of the center of the window, there was the one book.

53:08.288 --> 53:09.409
Do you remember which one it was?

53:09.489 --> 53:10.490
No, I can't tell you.

53:11.250 --> 53:14.033
That's a great story.

53:14.165 --> 53:14.846
That was that.

53:14.906 --> 53:17.750
So then I was very popular.

53:18.611 --> 53:29.044
So when we came back and we decided, my brother and I, that our luck probably was more than the rare books than the mother was.

53:29.805 --> 53:36.875
And then we had the bad luck, or probably the good luck, that they had to leave the shop where we were in.

53:37.616 --> 53:38.557
Here in Amsterdam?

53:38.577 --> 53:39.178
In Amsterdam.

53:40.319 --> 53:43.243
And we had to establish ourselves among them.

53:44.118 --> 53:51.509
So we couldn't do this anymore.

53:52.170 --> 53:59.961
So we had to .

53:59.981 --> 54:07.352
And then someday I decided that we differ so much.

54:07.953 --> 54:11.678
Our character differ so much.

54:12.721 --> 54:15.224
Yeah, so then I put that at home.

54:15.244 --> 54:16.646
The state plans didn't go far.

54:17.447 --> 54:17.968
Makes sense.

54:19.570 --> 54:20.771
And he's... And I left.

54:22.273 --> 54:23.454
And so it starts again.

54:24.175 --> 54:27.019
Same story.

54:27.319 --> 54:28.581
And when did you start by yourself?

54:28.761 --> 54:29.202
What year?

54:29.622 --> 54:31.625
I was the first of January, 1950.

54:33.707 --> 54:36.130
So you're still a young man, a very young man.

54:37.171 --> 54:39.034
You're still in your 40s, 20s, aren't you?

54:39.114 --> 54:39.675
I was 30.

54:40.075 --> 54:41.237
I was just 30.

54:41.257 --> 54:42.218
Just 30.

54:42.358 --> 54:42.458
Yeah.

54:42.877 --> 54:44.819
And that was it.

54:44.839 --> 54:50.625
So... And then, how did you develop the specialty for which you became well born?

54:50.645 --> 54:52.867
Well, I don't know whether you're interested in it.

54:52.967 --> 54:53.128
I am.

54:53.228 --> 54:54.769
I'm interested in everything, actually.

54:54.789 --> 54:55.590
No, no.

54:55.610 --> 54:58.013
Because it is stupid.

54:58.033 --> 54:59.694
There, I guess, I'm having no money.

55:01.256 --> 55:10.565
I could better spend the few money I had, the little money I had, in buying one good book.

55:10.585 --> 55:12.107
And in buying hundreds published.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.222
So that was what I did.

55:15.343 --> 55:23.773
I bought one book and sold the book, and I had the money to buy another book, and to buy some other books, and to... That's brilliant.

55:24.033 --> 55:36.707
That's... To get money for... to pay for the food, and the rent, and... So you really focused on getting a small number of excellent books.

55:36.847 --> 55:39.390
Yeah, from the beginning of it.

55:39.410 --> 55:40.491
And I think that saved me.

55:41.973 --> 55:44.456
Because I am lazy, I'm not.

55:45.537 --> 55:47.059
No, not correct.

55:47.079 --> 55:48.401
I'm lazy, I'm not right.

55:52.005 --> 55:55.510
But I'm not thriving, I'm not.

55:55.570 --> 55:56.351
Full of energy.

55:57.993 --> 55:59.314
So where did you find these books?

55:59.395 --> 56:01.717
In Amsterdam, my book, at that time.

56:01.978 --> 56:06.463
Until the first time I went to London.

56:07.164 --> 56:08.706
And there I wrote one of the great books.

56:09.665 --> 56:10.526
Yes, I have.

56:10.786 --> 56:12.828
A Dutch book, but don't forget.

56:13.749 --> 56:18.454
Holland is not a world of a small country.

56:20.456 --> 56:28.845
It is not like telling Rosenbach and his Shakespeare's, or Krauss and his encurements, or manuscripts.

56:29.866 --> 56:35.512
It's always a difference in magnitude.

56:35.532 --> 56:38.895
But in reality, important,

56:39.550 --> 56:41.974
It might even be much bigger.

56:41.994 --> 56:47.924
But that's different again, because it is Dutch.

56:48.505 --> 56:56.820
And that's why I decided sometime that that was my prospect as well.

56:57.521 --> 56:58.943
With the Dutch market, too?

57:00.085 --> 57:01.187
The Dutch market, too, because

57:02.163 --> 57:05.667
As I said, I was just talking.

57:05.687 --> 57:10.734
I didn't have much international connections or clients or... Experience.

57:10.754 --> 57:11.975
Experience, not at all.

57:13.878 --> 57:30.499
Before I had been to Denmark, I had a friend who was art dealer, Dutch origin in New York, who came to meet

57:30.766 --> 57:35.832
in the same shop, in the small shop in the last time in Amsterdam.

57:37.815 --> 57:41.600
Well, we came later down, we became good friends.

57:41.620 --> 57:44.804
And he has an American family, a Hudson car.

57:44.824 --> 57:47.307
I don't know whether you remember Hudson cars.

57:48.268 --> 57:52.794
Hudson is one of these great, great American cars.

57:52.814 --> 57:54.456
Oh, the Hudson car.

57:54.496 --> 57:55.718
Of course, it's a wonderful car.

57:55.978 --> 57:58.461
Funny, it had a funny... And that was one of these...

57:59.082 --> 57:59.883
Open one.

57:59.903 --> 58:00.845
Yes.

58:01.266 --> 58:01.566
Beautiful.

58:01.586 --> 58:06.554
Driving in a car like that in Europe, in those days, and at the end the car broke.

58:07.315 --> 58:08.758
It was already sensational.

58:08.778 --> 58:16.771
So we went to Germany where I bought a fantastic coffee, I must say.

58:17.732 --> 58:21.979
In Germany, in Cologne.

58:22.139 --> 58:23.441
The Atlas.

58:23.702 --> 58:25.765
I just saw one in

58:26.251 --> 58:33.940
I saw one up at Stoke Gloucester Castle, up in... I was up at Stoke Gloucester and... Oh, yeah.

58:34.280 --> 58:40.948
But this was my first rebook, and that was sergeant and so on.

58:40.968 --> 58:41.989
March already then.

58:42.670 --> 58:43.751
But you had to pay for this.

58:44.072 --> 58:45.834
Yeah, but I could pay after.

58:45.854 --> 58:47.636
Oh, so they gave you terms.

58:49.859 --> 58:52.782
And did you buy it from an individual or from a...

58:53.099 --> 58:55.703
So the booksellers helped you, the trade helped you.

58:56.063 --> 59:05.316
Yeah, but this was, then it was in Germany, it was impossible to settle, because Cologne was a town, and you can't imagine.

59:05.837 --> 59:12.266
I mean, you could sit down on your knees in the center of Cologne, and you could overlook all the city.

59:13.047 --> 59:13.628
It was rubble.

59:14.229 --> 59:16.933
It was only rubble.

59:16.953 --> 59:22.701
So the bookseller who had a chance to sell, not in German work, that was the point.

59:23.525 --> 59:24.887
You've had to get into it.

59:24.907 --> 59:25.768
It was nothing.

59:25.948 --> 59:27.891
That was even more rubbish.

59:28.211 --> 59:38.304
So the understanding was you take the books and I pay in dollars or pounds, you know, over time.

59:38.324 --> 59:38.744
We did.

59:39.125 --> 59:42.950
And this is now 1950?

59:43.010 --> 59:48.197
That was before 1950.

59:48.237 --> 59:50.399
So it's still right after the war.

59:50.600 --> 59:52.502
And then we went to Denmark.

59:52.887 --> 01:00:01.359
That's the first book I sold to the university.

01:00:01.379 --> 01:00:05.144
Do you remember what book that was?

01:00:05.164 --> 01:00:09.049
That was a book that won't say much to any of your work.

01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:10.191
Well, don't be so surprised.

01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:13.275
No, no, because nobody will know.

01:00:13.295 --> 01:00:14.597
There's one great book from Brazil.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:20.785
As you may know, I have been for about 25 years in Brazil.

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:25.943
next to the Portuguese, the owners of Brazil.

01:00:27.006 --> 01:00:35.027
And the Dutch prince brother, Stadtholder, he was
