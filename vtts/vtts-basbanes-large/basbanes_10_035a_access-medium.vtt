WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:11.772
And we're talking to Clark Evans, senior reference librarian at the Library of Congress on the 24th of October, 1996.

00:11.832 --> 00:12.775
And they're showing me

00:14.510 --> 00:38.239
how would you describe this it's not quite elephant folio size volume it's a binding it even has the appearance of leaf gold golden leaf that's right guilt uh edges on the on the outside of this volume and you open it up and where you know sometimes you see these joke things where people have a weapon inside a bible have you ever seen that you open up a book and they've carved out

00:38.675 --> 00:41.339
these holes in here.

00:41.359 --> 00:43.543
Well, in this instance, what we have are six plates.

00:43.723 --> 00:44.364
That's correct.

00:44.384 --> 00:45.085
Dessert plates.

00:45.225 --> 00:46.467
I'm looking at two.

00:46.608 --> 00:47.649
One is titled The Peach.

00:48.430 --> 00:51.956
Ye garden's royal pride, am I a queen of beauty?

00:53.679 --> 00:54.660
I can't even mention it.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.004
This is in Kipling's hand, by the way, right?

00:57.271 --> 00:59.314
And this one above it is called Capples.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.737
That's right, Capples indeed.

01:00.757 --> 01:08.249
And so Kipling had visited this family, apparently, in Pennsylvania about 100 years or so ago?

01:08.269 --> 01:09.110
1889.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.572
Yep, a little more than that.

01:11.434 --> 01:16.201
And he apparently, as you said, was taken by this youngster.

01:17.083 --> 01:22.331
And as a little gesture of friendship, her name was Caroline, and this was in Beaver, Pennsylvania.

01:22.371 --> 01:23.633
Beaver, Pennsylvania.

01:23.832 --> 01:25.614
See, I'm a good studier, and I am picking up.

01:25.974 --> 01:28.817
He wrote these, and these were apparently impromptu.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.540
That's correct.

01:31.620 --> 01:32.161
Who knows?

01:32.181 --> 01:36.866
Presumably, it was done just because he was probably only visiting in a generation.

01:36.886 --> 01:43.693
And it seems also that the family had the perspicacity to bake these things and preserve them in some fashion.

01:43.713 --> 01:46.436
And here they are at the Library of Congress.

01:46.596 --> 01:47.477
How did they get here?

01:47.677 --> 01:49.399
I'll explain that in a minute.

01:49.419 --> 01:52.402
I just want to catch up to what we've already discussed.

01:52.422 --> 01:55.385
This is called Collection of Plates by Reggie Kimmel.

01:55.406 --> 02:01.232
Remember the young lady's initials are C.A.T., Caroline A. Taylor, and that is the cat of my parents.

02:01.252 --> 02:02.553
That's on the back of the plate.

02:02.573 --> 02:07.259
These are copies of them.

02:09.901 --> 02:12.084
These are grapes and berries.

02:13.505 --> 02:14.627
These are lovely.

02:14.647 --> 02:14.967
They are indeed.

02:16.820 --> 02:20.264
And you have photos of these?

02:20.504 --> 02:20.704
Yes.

02:20.824 --> 02:29.253
The photos that we see in the Binding probably date from the 20s as a New Yorker article to elaborate on them.

02:29.273 --> 02:31.095
Well, I must get that New Yorker article.

02:31.976 --> 02:36.340
And so these are grapes and berries, and there are two more, which would be titled.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.967
And you're turning these like as if they're pages in her name.

02:42.987 --> 02:45.009
That's right.

02:45.109 --> 02:45.389
C-A-T.

02:45.970 --> 02:46.050
Cat.

02:46.807 --> 02:48.469
Oh, indeed, isn't that a nice touch?

02:48.489 --> 02:50.090
He even put 18 years.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.131
He dated.

02:51.211 --> 02:52.693
Look, he's got a little face there.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.073
That's right.

02:53.093 --> 02:53.954
For a cat.

02:54.034 --> 02:54.975
For a cat.

02:54.995 --> 02:56.296
What are these?

02:56.416 --> 03:01.141
These are plums and watermelons.

03:03.403 --> 03:06.206
He spent some time on this, didn't he?

03:08.068 --> 03:10.130
Very much so.

03:10.150 --> 03:14.434
And you said these came over to the library and loved that.

03:15.055 --> 03:16.536
Plums, Children of the Garden.

03:16.676 --> 03:18.098
Do you keep saying Children of the Garden?

03:18.878 --> 03:26.705
I'm reasonably certain this came to us from the several Kipling collections that we have here in this edition.

03:26.725 --> 03:31.189
I'm reasonably certain this came to us as part of the Carpenter Kipling collection.

03:31.209 --> 03:33.211
Oh, yes, here we go.

03:33.251 --> 03:35.113
The William Carpenter Kipling collection.

03:35.613 --> 03:41.558
And I can give you some background information about how the collection came, et cetera.

03:41.578 --> 03:42.599
That's a great story.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.421
A marvelous story.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.402
And that hasn't been done, has it?

03:47.622 --> 03:53.432
I don't think, well, let's say it's, I mean, it's alluded to.

03:53.552 --> 03:57.438
A kitty cat, when you're looking at it upside down, a kitty cat's sitting on a fence.

03:57.639 --> 04:06.553
If somebody, I mean, this is the policy of the Library of Commerce, want to arrange to have photographs of these, color photographs of these, take a gun.

04:06.693 --> 04:07.314
That could be done.

04:07.755 --> 04:08.957
Oh, yes, it could be done.

04:09.545 --> 04:14.173
And does one have to know the call number of this, or is it sufficient to know the collection of places?

04:14.193 --> 04:15.876
Yeah, the Kipling Deserve Place.

04:16.237 --> 04:17.479
The Kipling Deserve Place.

04:17.619 --> 04:22.467
Carpenter Kipling Collection would be, if you wanted to take it an extra layer.

04:23.509 --> 04:25.192
Were they given to the library?

04:25.212 --> 04:25.853
Yes, they were.

04:25.873 --> 04:30.682
They were a gift to the library.

04:30.702 --> 04:32.264
What a great idea.

04:32.304 --> 04:35.029
Do we know anything at all about his visit to this family?

04:35.600 --> 04:46.492
Well, I think, let me see if this, in fact, while I'm putting paper in the machine, when I just scrubbed it out there, perhaps it would.

04:46.512 --> 04:52.558
It certainly gets into the fascinating history of the binding, which is that story unto itself, of course.

04:52.578 --> 04:53.599
The New Yorker.

04:53.880 --> 04:54.480
Isn't that great?

04:56.382 --> 05:03.090
I'm reading The New Yorker here of December 14, 1929, and it's the piece on page 22.

05:03.150 --> 05:05.252
It's titled Six Dinner Plates.

05:06.346 --> 05:09.891
And it discusses the set of plates which came to the library.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.055
Yeah, we have to get a copy of this.

05:14.517 --> 05:16.199
Good.

05:16.219 --> 05:19.924
We understand now how these verses were baked in.

05:20.205 --> 05:22.147
The girl's hobby was pottery making.

05:22.888 --> 05:27.955
During his visit, the girl made a set of six plates, and on each, the girl made the plates, you see.

05:29.377 --> 05:30.839
What a great story this is.

05:33.002 --> 05:33.342
Huh?

05:34.123 --> 05:34.364
It's great.

05:34.404 --> 05:36.066
And it's one little treasure.

05:37.143 --> 05:38.465
out of millions.

05:38.585 --> 05:41.489
Remember the old show, The Naked City?

05:42.270 --> 05:46.636
There are six million stories in The Naked City.

05:46.656 --> 05:47.658
You have just seen one.

05:51.303 --> 05:56.129
I love it.

05:56.309 --> 05:58.973
I'm going to write an article about this.

05:59.894 --> 06:06.103
This collection came to the library in 1941, so that would be about 12 years after.

06:07.113 --> 06:14.822
Carpenter was a great president of the Kitchen Society, and he was from Illinois.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.024
Let me actually photocopy these as well.

06:18.206 --> 06:21.109
This is very productive, by the way.

06:21.810 --> 06:22.831
Trust me on this.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.935
Let's touch that again when you think.

06:26.975 --> 06:28.257
What were you saying, sir?

06:28.277 --> 06:28.617
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:28.637 --> 06:32.001
I mean, your life all went off in the context of this as a chosen story.

06:32.141 --> 06:32.782
I think you're absolutely right.

06:32.802 --> 06:33.643
I think it's an exciting...

06:33.961 --> 06:34.842
concept indeed.

06:35.843 --> 06:43.934
Well, that would focus, you see, and recreating the visit, but then in an article for a magazine, you could explain this whole thing.

06:44.254 --> 06:50.642
Carpenter's involvement, how the book, how the book was new.

06:50.682 --> 06:55.027
For the children's book, it would just be this interaction of this child with this great writer.

06:55.628 --> 06:58.512
Also, I'll lead to a question.

07:00.014 --> 07:02.517
I'm not a Kippen scholar.

07:02.557 --> 07:03.478
Was he indeed

07:03.998 --> 07:07.564
Did he have international renown by the late 1880s?

07:07.584 --> 07:08.125
Perhaps not.

07:08.165 --> 07:09.927
I think that may be a little bit young issue.

07:09.947 --> 07:10.929
I'll check that out.

07:11.129 --> 07:20.544
Because it may be that when he came, you see, at that point, he may have been relatively anonymous compared to, of course, his great renown that came later.

07:20.665 --> 07:22.227
And that would certainly be another time...

07:22.510 --> 07:28.075
I think you're right, because I have a number, and I'm not a Kipling reader, but they're just... Yeah, that's correct.

07:28.516 --> 07:32.780
In fact, his device on his books was a swastika.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.541
That's correct.

07:33.561 --> 07:33.961
That's right.

07:34.101 --> 07:35.082
Pre-Nazi swastika.

07:35.102 --> 07:35.843
That's correct.

07:35.863 --> 07:36.544
Indeed, you see that.

07:36.564 --> 07:37.504
I've seen that.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.748
That's right, which must have been a great embarrassment to him at the end.

07:40.788 --> 07:42.389
Well, he died.

07:42.409 --> 07:44.511
Oh, yeah, he's three years.

07:44.591 --> 07:47.434
It took over in... What year was he?

07:47.454 --> 07:47.714
33.

07:48.075 --> 07:50.777
He would have seen that for three years.

07:50.797 --> 07:51.538
Amazing.

07:52.531 --> 08:15.585
This is the earliest book we know of in Abraham Lincoln's possession.

08:15.937 --> 08:18.881
This is called Pickens Grammage.

08:18.901 --> 08:21.304
You really want to take my breath away, right?

08:21.605 --> 08:23.247
I have to hold it if it's okay with you.

08:23.387 --> 08:24.088
I promise to do it.

08:24.148 --> 08:26.351
Why don't you just describe it?

08:26.371 --> 08:28.875
Well, it's a little story book.

08:28.895 --> 08:31.959
Of course, when we think of Lincoln, we think of Springfield, Illinois.

08:32.019 --> 08:33.601
He's a hometown of many years.

08:33.641 --> 08:40.391
But prior to that, of course, as we remember the early tales of Lincoln, he lived in a little village of New Salem, Illinois.

08:40.411 --> 08:45.758
That's basically the first town that he lived in.

08:46.058 --> 08:52.567
Anyway, you're getting the idea about the story behind the book.

08:52.587 --> 09:07.407
Anyway, when he first appeared in New Zealand as a man of, what, 21 years of age, he went to the village schoolmaster and he said, I would surely like to have an English grammar.

09:08.789 --> 09:10.952
I'd like to learn more about the English grammar.

09:10.972 --> 09:13.956
Now, is this apocryphal or is this recorded?

09:14.122 --> 09:38.458
good solid historiography it is well documented in the hundred reminiscences and others so he went to Mentor Graham Mentor Graham was the name of the school and he went to Mentor Graham and said gee I would like to have an English grammar amazingly the school teacher did not have one but he knew of a farmer who lived six miles out of town who did have a grammar so Blinken goes the 12 mile round trip by foot

09:38.945 --> 09:44.032
undoubtedly there's some chores on this farm, there's a state to acquire the very book that we're holding now.

09:44.253 --> 09:46.335
And it's the sixth edition published in 1828.

09:46.396 --> 09:47.337
That's right.

09:47.597 --> 09:50.922
The first edition, this was Samuel Kirkham.

09:51.262 --> 09:52.945
K-I-R-K-A-J-M.

09:53.085 --> 09:53.746
That's right.

09:53.766 --> 09:58.433
The first edition was printed in Frederick, Maryland, not so many years prior to that, 1823.

09:59.073 --> 10:01.577
And it was an enormously popular

10:01.996 --> 10:06.201
I went through numerous editions from its first appearance.

10:06.221 --> 10:07.643
Is that a prior owner of A.D.?

10:07.703 --> 10:09.806
No, no, that's Lincoln's writing.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.007
That's Lincoln's writing, that's right.

10:11.628 --> 10:16.134
And indeed, what he's saying there is Anne M. Rutledge is now learning grammar.

10:16.374 --> 10:16.895
Oh, wow.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.717
Remember, of course, the tale about A.D.

10:18.817 --> 10:20.539
Anne, who's in New South?

10:20.559 --> 10:20.739
Yeah.

10:21.340 --> 10:25.185
So here's sort of a documentary evidence of a connection between the two of them.

10:25.503 --> 10:50.868
We're looking at the title page of the English grammar and familiar lectures, accompanied by a compendium, semicolon, embracing a new systematic, S-Y-S-T-E-M-A-T-I-C-K, order of parsing, P-A-R-S-I-N-G, comma, a new system of punctuation, comma, exercises in false syntax, and a key to the exercise.

10:50.888 --> 10:51.949
I actually love these titles.

10:52.199 --> 10:55.925
designed for the use of schools and private learners.

10:56.145 --> 10:58.689
Those last two words are actually private ones.

10:58.789 --> 11:00.772
Private learners.

11:00.812 --> 11:04.137
This grammar was sort of a self-teaching grammar.

11:04.378 --> 11:12.330
Grammars up to that time, Lindley Murray being the main grammarian from England, they were sort of designed for classroom use.

11:12.350 --> 11:19.000
The distinctive thing about self-teaching grammar, Lincoln would not have had access to a classroom yet,

11:21.123 --> 11:22.905
to work with on an individual basis.

11:23.546 --> 11:24.247
You see what this is?

11:24.287 --> 11:27.511
Another possible children's book.

11:27.531 --> 11:27.911
Yeah, that's right.

11:27.931 --> 11:30.214
It's the story behind the book.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.876
We're working on something, yeah.

11:32.097 --> 11:36.782
And also from my new book, we have a chapter on relevant sacred texts.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.364
This is a sacred text.

11:38.525 --> 11:38.965
It is.

11:39.626 --> 11:48.497
One of the questions that always comes down about Lincoln is how could this man with less than a year of formal stealing have such a remarkable command of the English language?

11:49.135 --> 11:58.626
And the answer to that question is probably complex, but I can guarantee you a component of it was right here, because we know concretely that he devoured this volume.

11:58.706 --> 11:59.407
He just read it.

11:59.547 --> 12:03.793
And he's written in, in his hand, which I'm pointing to at the eraser end of my pencil.

12:03.813 --> 12:05.154
That's right.

12:05.174 --> 12:07.577
He has written above where it says English grammar.

12:08.899 --> 12:09.780
N-M Rutledge.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.923
N without an E. A-N-N-M Rutledge.

12:12.943 --> 12:13.784
Rutledge.

12:13.804 --> 12:15.406
R-U-T-L-E-D-G-E.

12:16.027 --> 12:16.147
Right.

12:16.167 --> 12:17.849
And it says English grammar, right?

12:17.869 --> 12:18.450
That's right.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.186
Is now.

12:20.426 --> 12:20.947
Is now.

12:21.047 --> 12:24.391
And then the printed in is now learning, right?

12:25.031 --> 12:25.352
Grammar.

12:25.432 --> 12:25.792
Grammar.

12:26.733 --> 12:27.294
Yes, sir.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.915
And then what is Lincoln written?

12:28.935 --> 12:30.217
Now, this was an insert.

12:30.277 --> 12:35.102
Lincoln clerked a sort of gentleman named Denton Offit there in New South Wales.

12:35.262 --> 12:36.143
Oh, F-F-E-T-T.

12:36.163 --> 12:39.487
Yeah, he was a clerk in Denton Offit's store.

12:40.007 --> 12:41.489
How old was Lincoln?

12:41.509 --> 12:42.430
He probably said that.

12:42.650 --> 12:46.234
Here, he would have just turned 23, I believe.

12:46.274 --> 12:47.475
He was born in 1989.

12:47.962 --> 12:51.506
So he just turned 23 when that was written.

12:52.367 --> 12:55.690
But he would have been, by this time, he would have been quite a veteran of New Salem.

12:56.311 --> 13:00.475
By the way, it says, Mr. James, once again, Lincoln's writing, Mr. James Rutledge, that's Anne's father.

13:00.595 --> 13:02.417
Let's take it slowly.

13:02.697 --> 13:07.302
Mr. James Rutledge, this is the father of Anne, pleased to pay the bearer, David P. Nelson.

13:07.322 --> 13:11.427
Pleased to pay the bearer, B-E-A-R-B-R, right?

13:11.447 --> 13:15.511
David P. Nelson, $30.

13:15.531 --> 13:17.233
And the $30 is written now?

13:17.293 --> 13:17.513
Yeah.

13:17.965 --> 13:22.551
and this should be your receipt for the same.

13:23.152 --> 13:23.493
Okay.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.575
March 8, 1832.

13:25.716 --> 13:29.360
And it's the numeral 8, TH underlined.

13:29.501 --> 13:30.462
That's right.

13:30.482 --> 13:37.712
1832, A Lincoln, and then underneath that, for D Offit.

13:38.473 --> 13:45.222
When I first saw that, I thought that was short for district office, but no, it was a person, Dutton Offit, who was indeed the clerk for the...

13:45.488 --> 13:50.075
Lincoln worked for this gentleman who could often own the store, but Lincoln worked in the goods.

13:50.095 --> 13:54.382
This volume is 1828, so published four years prior to this.

13:54.402 --> 14:00.090
Do you think that's the 1828 publication date for the book itself, or for this particular edition?

14:00.831 --> 14:02.254
We don't know.

14:02.294 --> 14:05.278
We're looking at the sixth edition title page of 1828.

14:05.619 --> 14:08.083
Once again, the book initially appeared in 1823.

14:08.103 --> 14:09.986
Now, he got this as a new book, you think?

14:10.326 --> 14:12.289
It must have been relatively new, because

14:12.488 --> 14:14.372
So it's been beaten to death by him.

14:14.412 --> 14:16.817
Yeah, that's right.

14:16.917 --> 14:21.326
He arrived in New Salem, I believe, in 1830, when he was 21 years of age.

14:21.927 --> 14:31.186
So it would have only been, let's say, at the most, two or three years old when he would have gotten his... Probably he was just two years old.

14:32.228 --> 14:32.809
Wow.

14:33.987 --> 14:35.309
But it might have been new.

14:35.509 --> 14:36.390
That's right.

14:36.430 --> 14:39.815
But the significance of this book, once again, you said he devoured it.

14:40.116 --> 14:40.456
That's right.

14:40.476 --> 14:42.979
And you were telling me something.

14:43.400 --> 14:51.772
Well, actually, it shows a documentary proof of its connection with Anne.

14:51.792 --> 14:59.543
For many years, let's say from 1970 to 1940, historians always played up a romantic and panglement between Abe and Anne.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.345
Anne has perhaps, you know, died.

15:01.865 --> 15:05.409
Young, about 1830, died tragically in a mountain.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.171
About long after this inscription.

15:07.191 --> 15:07.631
That's correct.

15:07.671 --> 15:08.132
That's correct.

15:08.652 --> 15:22.187
And so, historians very much were attracted to this idea that the two of them were sort of, how should I say, Jewish sweethearts.

15:23.168 --> 15:26.832
And indeed, that held sway in history so broad.

15:26.852 --> 15:28.193
It was at Lincoln for decades.

15:28.679 --> 15:40.457
Starting in the 1940s, James G. Randall, who comes to mind, historians really started to attack this concept, that they thought that this was this idea that the two of them were romantically involved.

15:40.537 --> 15:41.638
It was a fabrication.

15:42.219 --> 15:56.501
And so for the next 40 to 50 years, and indeed to a degree right to this day, historians are trying to throw cold water on the idea that the two of them were romantically involved.

15:56.521 --> 15:57.302
But in point of fact,

15:58.362 --> 16:09.152
More recently, serious historians have re-looked at the story and found that actually there's pretty solid evidence that indeed they were, more than friends.

16:09.832 --> 16:14.957
And so I can cite some articles for you on that film.

16:14.977 --> 16:16.098
I don't even know if that's that necessary.

16:16.458 --> 16:21.543
But basically, once again, after Lincoln is finished with the volume, he passes it on to Anne.

16:22.524 --> 16:27.188
And of course, obviously, we see that they... And that is definitely his A.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.366
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

16:29.386 --> 16:30.988
There's no ambiguity about that.

16:31.449 --> 16:35.435
So anyway, the book passes on to Anne.

16:35.615 --> 16:39.321
Of course, Anne, once again, tragically dies in 1835.

16:39.341 --> 16:44.509
And the book then is passed to one of the Rutledge brothers, one of her brothers.

16:44.529 --> 16:48.095
That brother, I think, migrates out west to Montana.

16:48.836 --> 16:54.745
And it's to the sons of that brother, Jane Hammond,

16:55.012 --> 17:07.791
in Decatur, Illinois, was able to acquire the mind, she was able to, she'd heard of his grammar and she was curious about what could have happened to her.

17:07.811 --> 17:15.463
So she made contact with all of the other descendants and was able, through one of them, to find and view, here it is.

17:15.543 --> 17:16.705
How recent?

17:16.725 --> 17:19.990
Oh, this was in the 1920s when Joan Handen was doing this.

17:20.010 --> 17:20.871
So fairly recent.

17:20.891 --> 17:22.654
Yeah, that's right.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.917
As things go.

17:25.268 --> 17:33.637
when, indeed, at that point, Jane Hammond was collecting a lot of Lincoln material.

17:33.657 --> 17:35.278
This was in there all the time?

17:35.298 --> 17:35.739
No, no, no.

17:35.759 --> 17:37.340
I think that was inserted in.

17:37.360 --> 17:37.941
Oh, what's this?

17:38.782 --> 17:50.794
That's probably, I don't think this is Lincoln related, probably from other owners maybe in the village, or possibly maybe it was written into that former's family.

17:50.814 --> 17:51.395
Well, it must have been.

17:51.535 --> 17:52.416
Look, 1829.

17:52.436 --> 17:53.757
This would have been scribbling

17:54.192 --> 17:59.181
So what we've just done is we've lifted up this sheet, which has been tipped in.

17:59.281 --> 18:01.925
It's been tipped in.

18:01.945 --> 18:04.510
And then underneath this, we're seeing some other writings.

18:04.530 --> 18:05.612
That's right, that's right.

18:05.632 --> 18:06.533
And the air of the year.

18:07.595 --> 18:11.642
It says somebody might commence study.

18:12.443 --> 18:15.328
They've actually made a record of their reading, haven't they?

18:15.348 --> 18:17.292
They've made a record of what they're doing here.

18:17.312 --> 18:19.896
And this is dated 1829.

18:21.007 --> 18:26.074
So did the book come to the library with this sheet?

18:26.094 --> 18:29.659
That I'm not sure, although it's entirely possible that it did.

18:30.360 --> 18:39.092
But certainly there's a connection between this book and this piece of paper.

18:39.192 --> 18:45.040
It's quite possible that the fact that it's another piece of paper

18:45.577 --> 18:52.083
paper evidence of Lincoln's presence in New Salem, that someone thought it would be appropriate to have this.

18:52.303 --> 18:58.869
And you said this is also the earliest book known to have been in Lincoln's possession.

18:59.069 --> 19:00.430
That's correct.

19:00.450 --> 19:11.940
Do you have any idea, that's not your job here, but I mean I just recently read about a Lincoln letter, a million dollars, about as risky as, you know, to a little girl.

19:12.561 --> 19:15.043
Can you imagine, and this is when he was running for president,

19:15.428 --> 19:20.575
you know, 32 years, whatever, 30, 28 years after this.

19:21.295 --> 19:25.260
A million dollars, maybe?

19:25.381 --> 19:38.297
I would perhaps, because nothing like this, I'll link in my manuscript this one thing, because nothing of this nature, it would be hard for me.

19:38.716 --> 19:43.764
Yeah, I'm sure that's extraordinary.

19:43.784 --> 19:44.365
Wonderful.

19:44.385 --> 19:45.848
And I'm so glad it's here.

19:45.868 --> 19:47.991
It could be someplace else.

19:48.011 --> 19:49.273
And this was the sentiment.

19:49.414 --> 19:54.582
When this descendant of Anne Rutherford...

19:55.118 --> 19:56.359
said that, okay, Ms.

19:56.379 --> 19:58.382
Allen, you can have the book.

19:58.402 --> 20:07.131
She said that she would only receive except this book from the Rutgers Center, the idea that it was destined for the Library of Congress in Washington.

20:07.151 --> 20:09.374
They would know that she would serve as a prophet.

20:09.494 --> 20:12.137
It's a wonderful story.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.840
So you've got your favorites here, aren't you?

20:14.860 --> 20:15.200
Oh, yeah.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.942
No question about it.

20:16.962 --> 20:19.725
But it seems to me that your favorites have a story attached to them.

20:20.887 --> 20:29.539
I think there's a narrative quality behind the book as a grammar in Lincoln's grammar.

20:29.599 --> 20:48.987
I think in this particular case, let's say that I have a personal interest in Lincoln, as indeed millions of other Americans do, and it's wonderful thanks to Alfred Whittleston that he had this great collection of Inconiana in The Division.

20:49.557 --> 20:56.928
the more you become involved in a collection, something like this takes out a game, of course.

20:57.188 --> 21:04.158
That goes into my top ten tactile experiences with forestry.

21:04.479 --> 21:05.661
I'm delighted.

21:05.761 --> 21:12.751
I'm ranking it on the Google Earth Bible.

21:12.771 --> 21:13.472
It's a great

21:14.667 --> 21:16.149
A great piece of history.

21:16.169 --> 21:16.910
A great piece of American history.

21:16.930 --> 21:20.035
I'm holding a book, that he would have Lincoln.

21:20.055 --> 21:21.958
This just didn't pass through his hands.

21:22.459 --> 21:27.146
He spent unknown hours with that book.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.328
That's right.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.851
This is not something that somebody just hadn't signed.

21:31.372 --> 21:34.276
This book actually helped shape and inform him.

21:34.317 --> 21:35.318
That very book.

21:35.338 --> 21:36.500
A copy of that book.

21:37.261 --> 21:42.649
If you want to know what association... Years ago, I...

21:43.186 --> 21:47.410
I wrote a little article for a newsletter here in town called The Wayne Pony.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.372
And let me see if I can dig that up before you have it.

21:49.392 --> 21:53.977
I'm not sure I have it readily available, but if I do, it might help out.

21:54.017 --> 22:00.384
Oh, sure, here we are.

22:00.404 --> 22:03.347
Okay, super duper.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.468
Can we do email at all?

22:05.269 --> 22:05.709
I can.

22:05.729 --> 22:07.071
I'm sort of getting into his way.

22:07.431 --> 22:09.193
Okay, we're better to do it this way.

22:12.835 --> 22:16.759
the popular and video travels here.

22:16.779 --> 22:21.364
Peter undoubtedly showed you some of the items from the Leicester Rosenwald collection.

22:21.565 --> 22:27.892
And I was so lucky that when I was here, that great exhibition was going on.

22:27.952 --> 22:31.275
In fact, I've got my name in that book.

22:31.295 --> 22:31.836
I made it.

22:32.016 --> 22:34.879
So I was... I basically saw everything.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.864
Do you know that they show any of these 20th century French findings at all?

22:38.884 --> 22:39.685
I don't think anything.

22:39.705 --> 22:41.847
I just wanted to show you a few of them.

22:42.181 --> 22:49.652
Paul Bernet Jones, and this is called Dapri Parry, 1921, I believe.

22:50.413 --> 22:51.955
Look at that.

22:52.095 --> 23:01.528
And I just thought that you might be here.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.651
Now is Lessing into binding so much?

23:03.712 --> 23:06.295
There must be great illustrations.

23:07.918 --> 23:08.899
Yeah, there is, there is illustrations.

23:08.919 --> 23:11.783
Dapri Parry, look at the paper.

23:12.995 --> 23:15.758
Oh, that's beautiful.

23:15.778 --> 23:19.782
Lithographs of Jean-Louis Foussino.

23:20.242 --> 23:21.523
B-O-U-S-S-I-N-G-A-U-L-T.

23:21.624 --> 23:23.966
Okay, let him read.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.508
Oh, that's beautiful.

23:26.568 --> 23:31.433
Oh, I think about that.

23:34.596 --> 23:36.298
This is probably an addition to how many?

23:36.498 --> 23:37.639
Half a dungeon?

23:37.780 --> 23:38.480
One.

23:39.301 --> 23:41.263
Because the binding makes it unique.

23:42.121 --> 23:51.812
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

23:51.832 --> 24:04.647
And it looks like, of course, it was just recently, once again, actually, we're looking at a work from about 19, 20, 21, I don't know, 75 years.

24:04.667 --> 24:05.267
Yeah, 21 seems to be the best.

24:05.287 --> 24:05.488
Beautiful.

24:05.508 --> 24:07.690
Quite a job you have here.

24:10.606 --> 24:13.410
And obviously, we have a deep appreciation to these things.

24:13.450 --> 24:17.957
This came over with the Rosenwald collection.

24:17.977 --> 24:27.592
Just one more book.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.656
This is from 1930.

24:30.676 --> 24:39.870
Once again, one of the Almanides is finding the holograms by the Almanides.

24:41.977 --> 24:44.559
Do you like bindings as a rule, yourself?

24:44.980 --> 24:51.306
I can't claim any scholarship in terms of an art historian as in the context of the arts.

24:52.647 --> 24:53.968
That's a layman, goodness, yeah.

24:53.988 --> 24:58.993
Yeah, who would not indeed be something like that?

24:59.013 --> 25:00.414
I don't want to focus on your specialty in that.

25:00.454 --> 25:08.462
Now, how does this particular binding relate, say, how does it complement the text or whatever?

25:08.482 --> 25:09.823
Well, yeah, I think, actually,

25:10.934 --> 25:13.918
Two or three things here.

25:13.938 --> 25:16.160
Notice the title and the silver.

25:17.942 --> 25:18.463
I can't see.

25:18.483 --> 25:19.104
I should just say it.

25:19.184 --> 25:28.695
In other words, notice how the binder is just... He's actually done every other... On the raised part of the binder, he's written out the title.

25:28.715 --> 25:31.358
And notice the author is on the lower part.

25:32.520 --> 25:37.045
A-P-O-L-I-N-A-Pollinaire.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.608
I believe that

25:40.195 --> 25:44.101
Obviously, in something like this, there was a limited work.

25:44.121 --> 25:49.569
Each line is unique in some fashion from the others.

25:49.829 --> 25:53.194
And the best way for me, oh, by the way, let me see you.

25:53.214 --> 25:53.955
Oh, there.

25:54.275 --> 25:55.697
You can let me see to it.

25:55.717 --> 25:56.258
Look at that.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.825
When you open it, see, but there's a sort of paragraph where it's closed, isn't it?

26:00.845 --> 26:03.389
Oh, there's some treasures here.

26:03.569 --> 26:05.051
Yeah, this is spectacular.

26:05.071 --> 26:05.291
Oh, my God.

26:05.311 --> 26:06.774
That's a beauty.

26:06.794 --> 26:08.436
Paul Bernays of 1931.

26:09.678 --> 26:09.898
Oh, my God.

26:10.756 --> 26:21.888
Well, I just had the rare privilege and honor to hold Abraham Lincoln's grammar, dated 1832, in his hand.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.853
That's right.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.200
Well, actually, the grammar was interesting.

26:26.483 --> 26:29.326
1830, I would think, is one of the first words required.

26:29.906 --> 26:33.990
But I think that inscription he wrote was 1832.

26:34.050 --> 26:42.759
When he clerked in James Rutledge's store, that would have been attached to... Oh, I see.

26:42.779 --> 26:45.402
That's not necessarily related to the book.

26:45.422 --> 26:45.882
Okay, that's good.

26:45.922 --> 26:51.968
Well, it is to the extent that it tells the whole story of his time in New Salem and his attachment to the Rutledge family.

26:52.285 --> 27:21.347
um and uh there's no doubt about its authenticity as an original link in the autograph but um so in a broad sense it does it is related to the book i think that was clearly put in something that starts to be collected and um let me actually um believe it or not john has gone through about four books the first two we've really got

27:21.817 --> 27:29.553
Well, I read Kipling's dessert plates and I read Kipling's dessert plates and I read a little piece on that.

27:29.573 --> 27:33.742
And I might even, I'm thinking out loud, do a children's book.

27:33.762 --> 27:35.065
That's brilliant.

27:35.185 --> 27:37.851
I mean, it's a mix of natural.

27:38.236 --> 28:04.598
I think you should probably get a little more into the detail about

28:05.472 --> 28:18.464
Once again, you won't find it.

28:18.584 --> 28:21.827
And as you said, that also came over with the .

28:21.847 --> 28:31.115
You wouldn't even know that you could see through those.

28:31.135 --> 28:34.618
.

28:35.122 --> 28:38.646
I just brought out two other little things.

28:39.007 --> 28:42.451
This is just a final resume.

28:42.631 --> 28:45.195
We made a manuscript from about 1500.

28:45.275 --> 28:49.340
From where else?

28:49.360 --> 28:52.424
I think it's French.

28:52.444 --> 28:54.927
I'm not going to touch this one.

28:54.947 --> 28:57.270
I'm going to look at it.

28:58.451 --> 29:02.496
Not to denigrate in any way the calligraphic pages would be extraordinary as well.

29:05.142 --> 29:09.832
Oh, that's just so totally fresh.

29:09.852 --> 29:12.197
I mean, I could have been done two weeks ago.

29:13.058 --> 29:14.722
There's your lapis over there.

29:19.492 --> 29:20.113
Look at that.

29:20.650 --> 29:24.093
Can we know who owned this?

29:24.113 --> 29:27.096
Well, you know, I'm getting to this production for a long time.

29:27.116 --> 29:35.143
It was believed to have been the work of Jeffrey Torrey, but in point of fact, recent work has said no, it's not Torrey.

29:35.163 --> 29:36.885
Is this vellum, by the way?

29:36.965 --> 29:37.746
Yes, it is vellum.

29:37.766 --> 29:39.908
That's correct.

29:39.948 --> 29:40.488
Look at this.

29:40.789 --> 29:42.370
Hard to believe.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.312
Hard to believe.

29:44.612 --> 29:45.713
Absolutely.

29:45.733 --> 29:47.755
Look at the faces and smile.

29:48.308 --> 29:53.317
Look how precise the one is there.

29:53.337 --> 29:54.880
Look at the gold on the rope there.

29:58.466 --> 30:03.675
And the beads, the masterpieces, you know, when you think of paintings and then they're enclosed in a book.

30:03.996 --> 30:11.770
Yeah, and often I say, I've had a New York Museum in the public, which is true about that.

30:11.790 --> 30:12.932
That's just absolutely wonderful.

30:13.165 --> 30:20.505
And it brings up the fact that the first book illustration fully relates to what was being done on the canvas at the time period of time.

30:21.227 --> 30:22.872
Do we know who these artists are?

30:23.577 --> 30:33.933
I would need to check the most recent cataloging, but once again, for a while, it was thought Jeffrey Torrey was the artist here, but in point of fact... You said that we're not sure about that.

30:33.953 --> 30:34.333
That's right.

30:34.413 --> 30:37.358
I believe that there's reason to believe that he was not the artist.

30:37.378 --> 30:40.322
Is this listed in one of the Rosenwald catalog books?

30:40.342 --> 30:41.184
Yes, very much so.

30:41.364 --> 30:42.165
Very much so.

30:42.265 --> 30:46.732
It's indeed in the... And it says they run the... Number what practice?

30:46.772 --> 30:47.353
Number 14.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.255
Number 14.

30:48.355 --> 30:51.880
I'm just looking at the... It's number 14 in the catalog.

30:52.923 --> 30:54.184
we could get all of that.

30:57.688 --> 31:00.331
With the pastel quality in the background.

31:02.093 --> 31:06.998
You always look at the... What are these black things on the hand?

31:07.658 --> 31:11.242
The shoes that are on it?

31:11.262 --> 31:14.946
There's an Arabic proverb that we put in one of our little quote books.

31:14.966 --> 31:17.689
It says the book is a garden in your hand.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.833
It just said it's a museum.

31:22.943 --> 31:24.044
It's all of these things.

31:24.245 --> 31:26.828
That's the beauty of it.

31:28.010 --> 31:28.570
That's a treat.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.454
Yeah, that's really wonderful.

31:32.095 --> 31:36.982
And is it something that Lessing had bound, or did it, I don't think so?

31:37.002 --> 31:42.589
No, I think probably, well of course now the outside box would have been bound by these bookbinders in Philadelphia.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.031
I think that's an old binding problem.

31:44.051 --> 31:46.234
Yeah, that's probably a 19th century one.

31:47.142 --> 31:49.705
Our binding says Jeffrey Torrey, 1524.

31:49.825 --> 31:50.546
That's right.

31:51.067 --> 31:53.270
And once again, that's the binding?

31:53.290 --> 31:54.211
Yeah, okay.

31:54.231 --> 31:55.492
No, no, that's the label.

31:55.653 --> 31:56.353
That's the label.

31:56.874 --> 31:57.395
That's the way.

31:57.455 --> 32:02.321
Decades ago, I think there was a whole week through that.

32:02.881 --> 32:04.964
That takes a forward a couple hundred years.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.706
That's right.

32:06.726 --> 32:07.267
Look at that.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.789
That's wonderful.

32:15.037 --> 32:16.238
What's our schedule, sir?

32:16.488 --> 32:34.994
Look at this work back here.

32:35.014 --> 32:36.115
And what is it?

32:36.155 --> 32:39.179
What kind of a book is it?

32:39.260 --> 32:41.803
It's a book of hours.

32:44.416 --> 32:49.363
undoubtedly produced for some of the considerable substance.

32:49.383 --> 32:51.987
Yeah, but that's an old binding, yeah.

32:52.007 --> 32:57.355
Well, say early 1950s, perhaps.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.898
And it was used, too, wasn't it?

32:58.978 --> 33:02.102
It was handled.

33:02.223 --> 33:08.392
That's the house back in there.

33:08.412 --> 33:13.900
This is a 1782 Dutch Bible, and it's...

33:14.875 --> 33:23.727
In fact, we still have some acquisition information out there.

33:23.847 --> 33:31.978
I just wanted to show you the illustrations of the work of the Remain de Hoog.

33:32.058 --> 33:32.679
Of whom, I'm sorry?

33:32.779 --> 33:35.122
Remain de Hoog, HFGUE.

33:36.324 --> 33:42.452
He was a particularly renowned Dutch printmaker and illustrator at the time.

33:42.922 --> 33:46.707
let's say the late 17th, early 18th centuries.

33:46.727 --> 34:06.313
And so we have some of these other works, and this particular acquisition from a few years ago obviously helped strengthen our local buildings, but notice the, unlike most other extant editions of this particular, these are all hand.

34:09.162 --> 34:15.530
by an artist of some considerable ability, I would say.

34:16.050 --> 34:17.192
I would think so.

34:17.432 --> 34:19.134
Look at that.

34:21.837 --> 34:26.463
It just flies against general with, you know, wisdom that if it's colored, it's not as good.

34:26.583 --> 34:27.764
It's just ridiculous.

34:29.046 --> 34:31.469
Except if you have the master himself coloring.

34:31.489 --> 34:32.470
Well, that's another story.

34:33.471 --> 34:39.118
Actually, it's in two volumes, and indeed you're just to...

34:41.174 --> 34:44.598
And look how this old paper stands up.

34:47.762 --> 34:48.583
That's beautiful.

34:49.164 --> 34:49.884
Look, feel that.

34:51.647 --> 34:55.131
And that's probably a contemporary binding, wouldn't you say?

34:55.191 --> 34:55.451
Yes.

34:55.531 --> 34:59.316
No, that binding does appear to be the original binding.

35:00.117 --> 35:00.758
Oh, boy.

35:04.742 --> 35:05.583
Oh, my God.

35:05.623 --> 35:07.806
That's wonderful.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.910
Biblia.

35:13.030 --> 35:15.033
What's the generic name for this?

35:15.073 --> 35:29.710
Have any scholars used it since its acquisition?

35:29.730 --> 35:30.311
Probably not.

35:31.192 --> 35:34.976
They bought it for you, sir.

35:34.996 --> 35:38.400
You never know.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.458
Formalance would be interesting here.

35:40.478 --> 35:44.402
Do you have any idea who owned it?

35:44.903 --> 35:58.458
Yes, I think that's accessible information.

35:58.498 --> 36:07.408
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

36:07.979 --> 36:08.680
Geronimo.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.466
You put a G on it and you've got an Indian warrior.

36:12.949 --> 36:13.590
Oh, boy.

36:14.031 --> 36:16.616
We love these raps, don't we?

36:16.656 --> 36:18.339
Look how good they are.

36:21.766 --> 36:24.992
We still have California as an island over here.

36:30.102 --> 36:32.284
And that's what Dr. Billingson was saying yesterday.

36:32.304 --> 36:41.653
Thankfully, it didn't happen, but it just drives him crazy when his books are bought and raped and torn up and sold.

36:42.994 --> 36:45.276
What a criminal act it is.

36:45.657 --> 36:48.199
But there were people who would take that out, wouldn't they?

36:48.359 --> 36:48.920
Sure.

36:48.980 --> 36:56.447
Did you see the book?

37:01.777 --> 37:06.625
Any one of Otto Bettany's I've been working with is I've been just enjoying right now.

37:07.427 --> 37:13.898
And the animals there.

37:13.978 --> 37:19.687
That's gorgeous.

37:19.707 --> 37:23.874
And look at the evidence again.

37:23.894 --> 37:27.260
Magnificent.

37:27.701 --> 37:27.801
Okay.
