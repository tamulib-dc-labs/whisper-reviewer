WEBVTT

00:28.972 --> 00:30.474
Yes, good morning.

00:30.854 --> 00:34.538
Mr. Chevalier, please.

00:34.558 --> 00:38.762
Yes, my name is Nick Baz Baines, B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

00:41.105 --> 00:45.089
I'm a writer in Massachusetts.

00:45.189 --> 00:53.198
I was just talking to Susan Birdman, and I believe she's already spoken to Mr. Chevalier.

00:53.218 --> 00:57.122
I'm writing a book for Random House on book collectors and book collecting, and I will be attending a single of his books next week.

00:57.473 --> 01:03.784
I thought I might talk to him for a little while at least a minute.

01:03.804 --> 01:07.410
Okay, what's your phone number?

01:11.076 --> 01:13.740
Yes, I'm in Massachusetts, and it's 508-793-9186.

01:13.760 --> 01:13.880
Okay.

01:13.900 --> 01:14.662
Now, give me your message.

01:14.682 --> 01:17.186
Could you give me an idea when that might be, because I'll hang around with you?

01:17.206 --> 01:18.789
It should be very shortly.

01:18.809 --> 01:19.029
Okay, fine.

01:19.049 --> 01:19.430
I'll be in my desk.

01:19.450 --> 01:19.650
Thank you.

01:19.934 --> 01:20.755
Good morning, sir.

01:20.795 --> 01:21.376
How are you?

01:21.396 --> 01:21.816
Good.

01:21.836 --> 01:22.878
Thank you very much for calling.

01:22.998 --> 01:23.679
Appreciate it.

01:23.699 --> 01:24.840
Where am I calling, by the way?

01:24.941 --> 01:26.483
I'm in Worcester, Massachusetts.

01:26.563 --> 01:27.484
Oh, OK.

01:27.504 --> 01:33.231
And my day job here is I'm the book editor of the Worcester Telegram.

01:33.251 --> 01:36.075
And I'm also writing a book for Random House.

01:36.836 --> 01:38.298
I've been working on it now for it.

01:38.318 --> 01:40.181
In fact, I just finished drafting a letter to my editor.

01:40.201 --> 01:47.410
It's exactly a year since we signed our contract telling what I've been doing for the last year and how we're going.

01:47.997 --> 01:49.860
Briefly, what the book is about.

01:52.023 --> 01:53.605
It is not how to book collect.

01:53.625 --> 01:55.268
It is about book collectors.

01:55.568 --> 01:56.930
Half the book is history.

01:57.491 --> 01:58.753
Half the book is contemporary.

01:58.773 --> 02:00.675
And the contemporary section is really exciting.

02:01.356 --> 02:09.148
I've interviewed a number of important collectors, William Scheide at Princeton University, Carlton Lake in Austin, Texas, Charlie.

02:09.168 --> 02:09.789
Right?

02:09.809 --> 02:14.616
Yeah, I went to law school, Columbia.

02:14.636 --> 02:15.076
I don't know the card.

02:15.096 --> 02:15.557
I went to law school.

02:16.111 --> 02:19.175
He went to Harvard, I know.

02:20.176 --> 02:28.907
In any case, his collection of American fiction is 70,000 or 80,000 books, I guess.

02:28.967 --> 02:42.304
But that's just, you know, those are the individual collectors and also spending a good deal of time on institutional collections, which have been formed largely through the efforts of private collectors.

02:44.680 --> 02:52.189
The New York Public Library is entirely indebted to private collectors.

02:52.209 --> 03:01.119
So it's, it'll be good stories, if you're off with the book guards, groups, and scholars, and the way that C.W.

03:01.139 --> 03:11.531
saw the archaeology was there too far in our keen subject of interest to the general readership of trying to do the same thing with book collecting.

03:11.551 --> 03:12.392
That's kind of my quick

03:12.676 --> 03:16.360
My quick explanation of what I thought.

03:16.380 --> 03:20.164
I did spend some time in L.A.

03:20.184 --> 03:20.524
in August.

03:20.544 --> 03:23.787
Bill Self, do you know Bill?

03:23.807 --> 03:26.150
He's a producer.

03:26.170 --> 03:31.675
God, I know the name, but not as a book collector.

03:31.695 --> 03:32.857
He's been collecting one for 34 years.

03:32.877 --> 03:39.223
I talked to John Larroquette, the actor, who collects modern forests.

03:39.608 --> 03:46.677
Sandy Berger up in Carmel, who has a marvelous William Morris collection for the finest in the world.

03:46.697 --> 03:47.979
I've handled some of these things.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.561
I handled Shady's Gutenberg Bible.

03:49.581 --> 03:54.127
When I was at the Lilly Library, I handled Tamerlane.

03:54.147 --> 03:56.951
We were a fountain of knowledge on book collectors.

03:56.971 --> 03:57.471
I hope so.

03:57.491 --> 03:58.353
I hope that's the case.

03:58.933 --> 04:01.857
But again, the focus is stories.

04:01.877 --> 04:02.198
Right.

04:02.218 --> 04:03.519
Telling good stories.

04:03.639 --> 04:05.582
Now, I'm coming to your sale next week.

04:06.068 --> 04:23.317
We also got a piece from the New York Times, which will be published, I believe, January, February.

04:23.337 --> 04:25.140
The hook for this piece is the sales, major book sales this fall I've been to.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.462
Everything of importance, it's Sotheby's, Christie's, and Swan.

04:26.482 --> 04:27.604
Your sale is the big book sale for Christie's this fall.

04:37.321 --> 04:47.352
You have a chapter that starts with the wholesale in 1911, which was the great American book auction ever.

04:47.372 --> 05:00.327
I'll start a chapter with that, with Huntington coming to New York on the train, and the sitting at the old home of George D. Smith, and all of a sudden announcing his presence to the bookworm.

05:00.347 --> 05:01.388
Prior to that, nobody really paid him any attention.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.054
And at that sale was Bill Green for J.P.

05:04.094 --> 05:05.336
Morgan.

05:05.456 --> 05:06.477
Rosenbach was there.

05:06.497 --> 05:09.462
The Wideners were there.

05:09.502 --> 05:10.343
Henry Fullager was there.

05:10.363 --> 05:11.685
Everybody was there.

05:11.825 --> 05:13.508
Book collecting was a bigger thing then, yeah.

05:13.528 --> 05:14.830
Yeah, but it's a device.

05:14.910 --> 05:21.239
I can use that auction as dramatically as a device to use all these people, you know.

05:22.061 --> 05:27.829
And that chapter will end with the Jerome Kern sale of 1929, which preceded a great crash.

05:27.849 --> 05:31.054
And so I kind of blackened the golden age by most of the deal.

05:35.658 --> 05:40.688
But I think it'll be fun.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.672
Random House certainly thinks so.

05:42.692 --> 05:45.878
They're the first house to look at it, and they bought it.

05:45.898 --> 05:49.546
They've got a paperback deal with vintage as well.

05:50.407 --> 05:52.792
So it'll be around for a while.

05:53.995 --> 05:54.475
It'll be in print.

05:54.976 --> 05:57.261
And here you are, one of the very few

05:57.764 --> 06:04.193
whose books are going to sell that one can talk to, I guess.

06:05.735 --> 06:08.239
You know what I mean by that, right?

06:08.259 --> 06:08.339
Yep.

06:08.359 --> 06:14.548
And I wonder if you... What profit this decision to sell to part with your books?

06:14.568 --> 06:18.293
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

06:19.435 --> 06:23.340
I got very, very interested in books, and I collected it very, very intensely.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.725
I mean, other than my own work, that really was what...

06:27.363 --> 06:28.144
I was doing.

06:29.385 --> 06:38.295
About four years ago, four or five years ago, I started working with something called the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.120
There are two big businessmen's clubs in Los Angeles.

06:42.180 --> 06:44.463
The Jonathan Club is one of them.

06:44.483 --> 06:56.256
And I got interested in learning about California art and the early California artists, and four early California artists were made life artists of the Jonathan Club.

06:57.012 --> 07:26.952
and there was a lot of art there but it was not not well maintained it needed to be cleaned and some needed reframing some frames need gilding etc and i convinced the club that what we should do is to improve the condition of the paintings and perhaps look at getting some more and i got some money from the club to do that and i went out and hired a really wonderful lady to be our part-time curator

07:27.573 --> 07:30.176
who had been active with the California Museum.

07:30.376 --> 07:34.160
And as time went on, that led to forming an art foundation.

07:35.162 --> 07:41.949
So I formed an art foundation where it was supported by members of the Jonathan Club.

07:41.969 --> 07:48.897
And the goal of the foundation was to acquire California art and loan it to museums so that people could see it.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.580
And so then I started collecting.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.964
So then my interest

07:55.552 --> 07:58.416
began shifting more to California art.

07:59.097 --> 08:06.006
And at the same time, the kinds of things that I were collecting, the great books, um, they just weren't available anymore.

08:06.026 --> 08:12.355
I mean, uh, there are so few in, in, uh, in outstanding condition.

08:12.955 --> 08:22.368
Uh, there are so few great fine bindings, uh, from the period I was collecting that were done in the English speaking world.

08:23.710 --> 08:23.770
Um,

08:24.053 --> 08:36.651
And so I was finding that even though the collection had a relatively small number of volumes, there probably aren't more than 160 volumes, that it probably was the best collection in America.

08:36.671 --> 08:38.634
Certainly the best one I could find out about.

08:39.575 --> 08:40.036
Yeah, mine.

08:40.717 --> 08:41.058
Mine.

08:41.779 --> 08:45.424
And, you know, I know of one collection in England that's better.

08:45.664 --> 08:47.747
There may be more, but I only know of one.

08:48.188 --> 08:48.548
Which one is that?

08:48.568 --> 08:48.889
Getty.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.392
His collection is better.

08:51.733 --> 08:51.833
Okay.

08:52.437 --> 08:58.326
But even there, I'm much stronger in Sangorski and Sutcliffe than he is.

08:59.227 --> 09:14.569
I mean, I don't know what you know about this kind of binding, but these jewel bindings were done starting in 1906, and virtually all the good ones were done by the mid-20s.

09:15.230 --> 09:18.415
And in fact, all the great ones were done in three years.

09:18.575 --> 09:18.715
Mm-hmm.

09:19.775 --> 09:21.116
1912 to 1914.

09:21.257 --> 09:26.242
Uh-huh.

09:27.443 --> 09:35.552
Yes.

09:35.572 --> 09:36.132
Of the period.

09:36.152 --> 09:39.215
The period is late 19th century, early 20th century.

09:39.896 --> 09:44.861
I'm not suggesting that, you know, the early bindings, I've got an important collection.

09:44.901 --> 09:45.462
I do not.

09:46.083 --> 09:58.994
But from that particular period, and this all started with William Morris and the revival of arts and crafts, and then we started having a new development in fine bindings.

09:59.635 --> 10:08.482
From the 17th, well, from the 16th century until the last quarter of the 19th century, just about all the bindings looked the same.

10:13.226 --> 10:15.128
Well, you must know Sandy Bernard from Carmel, but his William Morris collection is preeminent.

10:15.547 --> 10:17.309
No, I don't know him.

10:18.972 --> 10:26.101
Again, I know the name.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.504
Oh, great.

10:28.524 --> 10:34.332
Great.

10:37.216 --> 10:42.162
Oh, it was the scholarship.

10:42.361 --> 10:44.283
It was the scholarship and acquiring them.

10:44.303 --> 10:45.484
It was learning about it.

10:45.565 --> 10:52.773
I would go back to the binders in London and in Bath, and I'd talk to the owners.

10:52.893 --> 10:54.014
Everybody was really friendly.

10:54.394 --> 10:58.319
And I could get back into whatever records were not destroyed in the two world wars.

10:58.839 --> 11:06.628
And I copied the records and learned everything I could about the people that worked on these bindings and then try to hunt them down.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.292
And that was the fun of it for me.

11:10.643 --> 11:13.647
Now, once I acquired them, I mean, I've kind of got them.

11:13.667 --> 11:14.828
They're in my own library.

11:14.868 --> 11:17.692
Nobody sees them except some of my close friends.

11:18.893 --> 11:27.443
They're fragile, so you can't really loan them out to exhibits unless you've got special lighting protection against ultraviolet lights so the leather doesn't fade, et cetera.

11:28.264 --> 11:32.610
And I thought, okay, now it's time, you know, to go public.

11:32.630 --> 11:34.091
And this was my way of going public.

11:35.133 --> 11:38.777
And pass it on, and then I'll move on to something else.

11:40.597 --> 11:43.962
Yeah, which is California art right now.

11:43.982 --> 11:44.803
So you're out of the books?

11:44.823 --> 11:45.764
Yeah, I'll be out of the books.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.758
And I guess the problem with this is the realization that you really couldn't improve this collection.

11:55.778 --> 11:56.338
Well, that's paramount.

11:56.358 --> 12:00.244
I mean, the chances of my getting, you know, I got this all in 15 years.

12:00.664 --> 12:04.349
If I spent the next 15 years on it, maybe I could improve it 10%.

12:04.830 --> 12:04.950
Right.

12:05.639 --> 12:09.883
Would you say that you were obsessive in your pursuit of these treasures?

12:09.903 --> 12:10.583
Oh, absolutely.

12:10.944 --> 12:19.251
I mean, I dealt with all the, not all, but you can't deal with them all, but I dealt with many of the key dealers that deal in this kind of book.

12:20.592 --> 12:24.396
And, you know, any time anything came up, I got first call.

12:30.081 --> 12:30.801
How did you get onto these bindings?

12:30.821 --> 12:31.242
How did that happen?

12:31.262 --> 12:32.483
Well, kind of by accident.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.005
I mean, I didn't start collecting book bindings.

12:35.272 --> 12:36.514
I started collecting.

12:37.195 --> 12:38.717
Well, I started having some free time.

12:38.757 --> 12:57.523
When my company owned Bergdorf Goodman, I'd be in New York, and at the end of the day, instead of going to a bar or chasing women, I would go down the street, and there was this bookstore called Barkfields, which is a preeminent name.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.344
You probably know it.

12:59.265 --> 13:05.093
And I'd go in there, and I'd just go around and just look at the books, and I'd go there, you know,

13:05.242 --> 13:07.124
many, many times and never bought a thing.

13:07.364 --> 13:08.025
And they didn't care.

13:09.086 --> 13:11.528
And at one point, I bought a $50 book.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.633
And then that got me started.

13:15.693 --> 13:22.620
And then the next time I was in, they had a collection of books in French and Italian that were partially bound.

13:23.741 --> 13:26.864
Not a very fancy collection, but really good books.

13:27.585 --> 13:32.650
And my wife is French, so I bought that whole collection for my wife.

13:33.490 --> 13:42.480
And then I started getting interested in children's illustrated books, limited editions by Arthur Rackham and Dulac and folks like that.

13:43.221 --> 13:46.645
And I started buying those.

13:46.665 --> 13:52.431
No, I sold those a few years ago to buy some of my extraordinary fine bindings.

13:53.432 --> 13:57.597
And then I started collecting private press books on vellum.

13:57.617 --> 14:00.460
And that's what I got very interested in, people like William Morris.

14:01.638 --> 14:29.248
no i sold those to buy fine bindings as well and i had developed a pretty nice collection of those um and then i got into the fine bindings and that was uh kind of by accident too because a lot of these children's illustrated books had been rebound by e joseph in london and my wife and i were in london one time walking down the street and i saw the bookstore e joseph and i said gee they've

14:29.482 --> 14:43.477
found some of my books, so I went in there, and I met the head of it, a fellow by the name of David Brass, and his wife had just had a baby that morning, and he had this wonderful jewel binding, which is the only one I've kept.

14:43.497 --> 14:53.768
It isn't the most important, but it was my first one, on Shakespeare's poems that actually he had gotten through San Francisco, and I bought it.

14:54.490 --> 14:58.535
And that's how I started becoming interested in that kind of book.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.903
Well, I mean, first I became obsessed with the scholarship, okay?

15:21.322 --> 15:34.423
And I made arrangements to get into Zanesdorf Book Bindery and Zangorski in Sutcliffe and Baton in Bath, who had taken over Riviere, which was an important bindery that went out of business in 1939.

15:35.645 --> 15:39.071
And I spent time there going through the records.

15:39.992 --> 15:46.603
And then I spent time with the book dealers, E. Joseph, which has been around for, I don't know, 100 plus years.

15:47.157 --> 15:51.483
And they had sold many of these bindings, and they specialized in them to try to hunt down where they were.

15:52.604 --> 15:59.133
And with Heritage Bookshop in Los Angeles, I'm friends with the people there, the Weinsteins.

16:01.075 --> 16:04.059
And they're very important in that kind of book in America.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.505
And Cummings in New York.

16:09.426 --> 16:09.687
Jim Cummings.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.189
Yeah, Jim gets some of those books.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.192
Those were the three main booksellers.

16:14.393 --> 16:16.135
And Mike Frost at Bartfield.

16:16.722 --> 16:19.705
which was more important in the past than they are now.

16:23.468 --> 16:26.271
Yeah, but I didn't get up to Boston much in those days.

16:26.331 --> 16:31.456
Later I did because I got active with Harvard, but in those days I didn't.

16:31.876 --> 16:43.287
So through them, and then I got a line on, about four years ago, I got a line on a guy that had bought from the Phoebe Boyle sale.

16:43.307 --> 16:44.468
You familiar with that sale?

16:45.089 --> 16:58.966
Well, this fellow had bought them, and my understanding is that he got married a second time, and his widow, wife number two, who had been, I guess, much younger than him, decided to sell her collection.

17:00.067 --> 17:14.505
And she contacted some book dealer, and he in turn contacted both Brass from E. Joseph and Lou Weinstein from Heritage, and they went there, and I guess they went there on a

17:15.008 --> 17:36.279
a Thursday, grabbed up everything, and then they had lined up customers to show them to, but I was the first customer on Saturday, and I bought the most significant things, which included the most important jewel binding ever made, which is in the sale, which is this Keats.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.361
Keats.

17:37.381 --> 17:38.683
Some poems by Keats.

17:39.424 --> 17:40.746
It took two years to do

17:41.097 --> 17:48.067
It took the team of the very best people in the firm, and they had the very best people in London.

17:48.087 --> 17:53.835
And it has 4,400 onlays of leather and over 1,000 jewels.

17:54.916 --> 18:06.512
And it's an illuminated manuscript, and they had a great painter named Geddes, G-E-D-D-E-S, who did these wonderful pre-Raphaelian paintings.

18:06.813 --> 18:09.957
And, you know, the whole thing is just a wonder.

18:10.409 --> 18:15.135
Is this something you can tell me what it cost you?

18:15.156 --> 18:15.396
No.

18:15.877 --> 18:16.898
I'm not going to tell you what it cost.

18:16.918 --> 18:18.360
But it cost six figures.

18:23.447 --> 18:23.547
Okay.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.450
How about, how did you feel if you got this?

18:25.470 --> 18:25.990
Tell me about that.

18:26.010 --> 18:26.070
Oh.

18:26.091 --> 18:27.693
They wouldn't tell me what they were going to show me.

18:28.794 --> 18:32.499
And, you know, they said, we have something really wonderful to show your collection.

18:32.539 --> 18:33.721
No, was this in L.A.?

18:33.741 --> 18:34.422
Yeah, this was in L.A.

18:34.442 --> 18:35.363
They brought it to L.A.

18:36.244 --> 18:37.146
They went down to Heritage.

18:37.566 --> 18:39.589
So I went down there at 10 o'clock in the morning.

18:40.261 --> 18:42.503
And, I mean, I was just overwhelmed.

18:42.583 --> 18:46.447
So at 1 o'clock, I called my wife, and I said, you've got to see this, you know.

18:46.787 --> 18:47.308
Oh, come on.

18:47.328 --> 18:48.389
I said, you've got to see this.

18:48.409 --> 18:49.109
So she came down.

18:50.050 --> 18:56.516
And at 4 o'clock, she called my son, and he had to come down.

18:57.277 --> 18:58.198
And we kept going.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.479
I mean, it was a heady experience.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.320
It was a high.

19:00.420 --> 19:04.263
And we all went out to dinner, and at 10 o'clock at night, I struck the deal.

19:05.404 --> 19:07.146
And that's when I sold back...

19:07.447 --> 19:11.953
all those other books I described to you as part of that deal.

19:12.194 --> 19:12.935
To the two of them.

19:13.656 --> 19:20.365
And then I still had to come up with an awful lot of money, which I did, to get very few books.

19:20.385 --> 19:27.936
But four of the top ten jewel bindings in the world were in that, including the number one.

19:29.919 --> 19:35.226
I think probably about number one, two, four, and five are in that.

19:35.510 --> 19:46.720
Now, if there were still summits to conquer out there, you'd still be collecting, you think?

19:46.740 --> 19:47.000
Oh, sure.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.864
But, I mean, I know where three of the other top ten are, and they're not going anywhere.

19:51.905 --> 19:56.709
So, you... And then the same thing with ivory miniature bindings.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.431
You know, I have some great, great ivory miniature bindings.

19:59.451 --> 20:00.532
But they're in institutions.

20:00.612 --> 20:02.414
A lot of these are in institutions.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.575
They're not going to go anyplace.

20:04.556 --> 20:04.656
So...

20:04.973 --> 20:08.919
Or they're in the Getty collection, and that's not going anyplace.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.220
So part of the kick for you, then, is getting them?

20:10.881 --> 20:11.041
Yeah.

20:11.062 --> 20:12.103
But when did you get them?

20:13.124 --> 20:22.317
Then I had special full leather boxes made for each of them to protect them forever because, you know, I just didn't want anything to happen to them.

20:22.778 --> 20:26.643
See, I guess what I'm driving at is a circuitous way.

20:26.904 --> 20:29.327
My opening chapter deals with...

20:29.999 --> 20:36.487
the moment inevitably comes when the precious volumes must pass to one of the hills.

20:36.507 --> 20:46.298
Most collectors don't even want to consider the inevitability of fighting with these things.

20:46.318 --> 20:52.425
What's amazing to me is how you just made this decision and you're simmering yourself.

20:52.445 --> 20:54.467
Is there going to be a little bit of hurt in there?

20:54.488 --> 20:57.010
No, because I will do that with everything.

20:57.091 --> 20:59.213
I mean, eventually I want to simplify.

21:00.003 --> 21:08.696
I mean, I think life starts simple and then we develop our interests, which also means we complicate it.

21:09.597 --> 21:14.304
And I think what we eventually should end up with is going back to simplicity.

21:15.065 --> 21:24.378
So I'm now 51 years old and, you know, by the time I'm 60 to 65, I'm going to be out of everything.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.204
I mean, I'm going to have a real simple life where I can just

21:28.589 --> 21:36.961
Not have to worry about this problem or that problem and travel and meet people and enjoy people and go scuba diving and have a great time.

21:38.483 --> 21:47.536
These things do not dominate your life.

21:47.556 --> 21:47.757
No, no.

21:47.777 --> 21:48.438
I guess you enjoy them, period.

21:48.458 --> 21:49.900
And I say it's time to measure them off to another life.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.801
Sure, sure.

21:50.881 --> 21:56.009
I mean, they're wonderful, but they're things.

21:56.029 --> 21:57.651
And, you know, pass them on.

21:57.901 --> 22:11.943
Now, one thing that really interests me about bindings is that it's really the only end of book collecting where you are not collecting the content.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.185
That's correct.

22:13.305 --> 22:17.452
The content is basically irrelevant to what you're collecting.

22:17.532 --> 22:20.196
And most people collect autographs, then it's irrelevant, too.

22:20.216 --> 22:21.959
It's just who signed it.

22:22.419 --> 22:26.085
Now, when you go out to buy a binding,

22:26.909 --> 22:31.094
What's inside, I mean, you don't even probably consider that.

22:31.114 --> 22:32.837
I mean, that doesn't enter the equation, does it?

22:32.857 --> 22:34.739
Unless it's an illuminated manuscript, yeah.

22:34.759 --> 22:35.941
That's another story.

22:35.961 --> 22:39.665
Yeah, and a lot of these are illuminated manuscripts.

22:39.685 --> 22:41.367
But then we're talking about another artwork in itself.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.249
But it's art.

22:43.390 --> 22:44.071
It's art.

22:44.091 --> 22:44.912
There's no question.

22:44.932 --> 22:47.615
So it's a book collecting, per se, then?

22:48.497 --> 22:52.822
Well, I can't say that either, because it all goes together.

22:52.882 --> 22:56.747
What is inside has to match with what's on the covers.

22:57.959 --> 23:08.270
But the thing is, if you do a binding, what you're trying to do is you're trying to put the contemporary art of the time together with the content of the book.

23:08.290 --> 23:18.381
If someone were doing Keats' poems today, he'd do a totally different kind of binding to reflect the art of today, or at least he should.

23:19.703 --> 23:24.388
You see, the problem that I had with binding up until the last quarter of the 19th century

23:24.723 --> 23:30.810
Everybody just copied the bindings that were done in the 16th and early 17th century.

23:31.431 --> 23:33.853
I mean, nobody tried to get contemporary with the time.

23:35.776 --> 23:38.719
But it's the way you're interpreting something today.

23:38.739 --> 23:43.865
Like if you see a Shakespeare play today, you interpret it differently than the time of Shakespeare.

23:43.885 --> 23:45.947
And so what the binding does is it does that.

23:45.987 --> 23:47.389
So it is one with the book.

23:48.314 --> 23:51.177
It's not just a separate, isolated painting hanging on a wall.

23:51.437 --> 23:52.378
It's one with the book.

23:52.538 --> 24:01.667
Now, when I get my copy of the catalog, which I'm getting tomorrow or the next day, will it describe the books that are contained inside these bindings?

24:01.687 --> 24:01.967
Sure.

24:02.768 --> 24:06.212
But not, you know, a catalog is highly technical.

24:06.292 --> 24:14.760
What I did is, in addition to that catalog, before I ever gave this to Christie's, because I wanted to have a remembrance, I had some scholarship done

24:15.314 --> 24:21.784
which goes way beyond what's in the catalog on each of these books, which will get much more descriptive of what's inside the book.

24:21.804 --> 24:22.445
Is that in the catalog?

24:22.545 --> 24:25.689
No, there wouldn't be room, but it's a book I have, which I'd be glad to show to you.

24:27.052 --> 24:27.893
Did you publish it?

24:27.913 --> 24:28.173
No.

24:29.034 --> 24:35.304
Well, I have more than one, but I haven't gotten it yet because it's being hardcovered for me.

24:35.324 --> 24:35.544
Oh, really?

24:35.564 --> 24:36.466
Is this something that you're going to sell?

24:36.486 --> 24:36.766
No.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.251
No, it's just for my own remembrance of this.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.157
But the catalog is limited in space,

24:44.795 --> 24:48.700
And so it can't have all the detail, but it has much more detail.

24:48.980 --> 24:52.284
Well, this is something I would like to see at some point.

24:52.304 --> 24:53.265
Sure.

24:53.285 --> 24:53.866
If that's at all possible.

24:54.086 --> 24:55.628
Do you get out here?

24:55.648 --> 24:58.392
I'm coming out again, I believe, first of the year.

24:58.412 --> 24:59.133
I'll be glad to come back.

24:59.153 --> 24:59.353
Sure.

24:59.693 --> 25:01.696
I'll have you over the house, and I'll be glad to show you.

25:01.736 --> 25:02.757
That would be nice.

25:02.817 --> 25:07.543
I do have a couple more interviews.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.106
I've got another day of research at the Huntington.

25:10.126 --> 25:11.848
And one of the rules I've been close to myself

25:16.537 --> 25:36.547
every collection.

25:36.567 --> 25:37.348
I'll see yours at Christie's next week.

25:37.368 --> 25:37.488
Right.

25:37.508 --> 25:40.653
Even the history stuff, there's no rehashing work that we have done for Rosenbach and Huntington and Morgan.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.716
We've got unread letters at the Rosenbach Library in Philadelphia, which has just been made available.

25:42.736 --> 25:44.178
Stuff that always, nice cherry stuff that we've always looked at before.

25:44.198 --> 25:45.580
So I'm going to give a nice, new, fresh look to everything I'm doing.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.341
That's a reasonable way of saying it.

25:46.777 --> 25:48.199
Everything is done to order.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.825
I'm really going out to meet the people I'm writing about.

25:52.326 --> 25:54.169
And if you have this book, I'd love to see it.

25:54.289 --> 25:55.150
Sure.

25:55.170 --> 25:56.673
And you will be at the sale next week?

25:56.773 --> 25:58.055
Oh, yeah.

25:58.075 --> 26:02.182
So I'll make it a point to seek you out and shake your hand.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.083
I'm the guy with the beard.

26:03.464 --> 26:04.485
Yeah, the guy with the beard.

26:04.505 --> 26:05.828
Yeah.

26:05.848 --> 26:07.510
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

26:07.530 --> 26:08.852
Are you from L.A.?

26:09.013 --> 26:10.275
From New York originally.

26:10.355 --> 26:10.455
Yeah.

26:10.857 --> 26:14.300
But I've lived in L.A.

26:14.541 --> 26:15.301
since 1972.

26:15.321 --> 26:20.106
My background is I went to Columbia, undergrad.

26:20.366 --> 26:21.227
I was in the Navy.

26:21.467 --> 26:22.528
I was on a Navy scholarship.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.609
I was in the Navy for three years.

26:23.649 --> 26:24.370
Had a great time.

26:24.430 --> 26:26.972
Loved it.

26:26.992 --> 26:28.654
I was on the Kitty Hawk.

26:28.674 --> 26:34.640
I was on the Erskine.

26:34.660 --> 26:34.840
Ah, okay.

26:34.860 --> 26:35.160
Public Affairs.

26:35.180 --> 26:35.280
Okay.

26:35.300 --> 26:35.821
When were you there?

26:37.663 --> 26:38.063
I was there in 1968.

26:38.768 --> 26:45.596
Okay, I was there 60 to 63, part of the commissioning crew, which was fun.

26:46.376 --> 26:51.182
And then I went back to Columbia Law School, and I also took a business degree there.

26:51.222 --> 26:58.190
And I've worked for Carter Holy Hail since 1972.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.112
Which does what, don't we?

27:00.192 --> 27:00.672
Retail.

27:01.213 --> 27:07.560
We're West Coast Retail, the Broadway, if you've ever seen it, the Emporium in San Francisco, Weinstocks.

27:08.063 --> 27:12.690
We're number one, I think, in the state of California, and we're in a number of other states.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.633
But we've owned Neiman Marcus over the years.

27:14.673 --> 27:19.360
We've owned Bergdorf Goodman.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.663
20% of Harrods of London at one point.

27:24.487 --> 27:25.689
Too bad you didn't get boonies before the guy in Canada did.

27:25.709 --> 27:27.271
Yeah, well, that would have been nice one to have.

27:28.573 --> 27:31.137
He stood up really good, too, didn't he?

27:31.157 --> 27:31.337
Yeah.

27:31.756 --> 27:34.058
He not only screwed up, but he screwed everybody up.

27:34.078 --> 27:34.619
Everybody.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.562
All of retail screwed up because of that.

27:37.582 --> 27:39.504
Terrible, terrible.

27:39.524 --> 27:43.007
Let me see, I have a couple other questions I want to ask you.

27:43.047 --> 27:46.230
So it's another question, very important.

27:46.250 --> 27:51.095
When you bought these, did you consider them investments?

27:51.115 --> 27:51.295
Never.

27:51.315 --> 27:55.540
I think that's a very important question because a lot of people are going to ask.

27:55.560 --> 27:55.900
Never.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.703
Collectors should never do that, and I never did.

27:59.383 --> 28:01.105
I'm not going to make any money on this.

28:02.890 --> 28:06.835
You'd be pleased if you do, obviously.

28:06.855 --> 28:09.518
Well, I'd be pleased, but I don't expect to.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.220
But that's not the motive.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.003
I don't know how it could be, certainly, in these times, either.

28:14.023 --> 28:15.345
No, that would never be the motive.

28:15.625 --> 28:18.128
That would never be the motive for me on this.

28:18.168 --> 28:21.972
I mean, if you collect, you should do it out of love and passion and scholarship.

28:24.055 --> 28:24.916
Not to make money.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.738
That's a speculator, Chuck.

28:27.629 --> 28:28.610
I'm not going to do that.

28:28.630 --> 28:31.454
I'll put my money in the stock market if I want to speculate.

28:31.474 --> 28:35.598
What kind of people do you hope get these items?

28:35.618 --> 28:36.059
Collectors.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.100
Collectors?

28:37.120 --> 28:37.381
Institutions?

28:37.401 --> 28:37.921
Collectors.

28:38.202 --> 28:45.851
Institutions is fine because institutions have an advantage because the institutions will then be able to show them to more people.

28:46.632 --> 28:48.794
The problem with fine bindings is they're fragile.

28:49.475 --> 28:51.257
There's a limited number of times you can open them.

28:52.688 --> 28:56.011
So if they go in institutions, they've got to be put on display.

28:56.031 --> 29:00.375
The problem with fine bindings in institutions is they put them away and nobody sees them anyway.

29:01.216 --> 29:03.798
I mean, the Huntington's got a couple of jewel bindings.

29:03.818 --> 29:05.240
I haven't gone over to see them.

29:05.260 --> 29:09.424
I'm sure I could, but you have to make appointments, you know, the whole routine.

29:11.706 --> 29:17.551
But that's just the nature of book collecting, and particularly of fine binding collecting.

29:17.571 --> 29:21.835
But I'd like to see serious collectors get them.

29:22.422 --> 29:24.984
I'm sure they will.

29:25.004 --> 29:26.366
Do you think Mr. Getty will be there?

29:26.386 --> 29:27.267
Buy a bag for Mr. Getty?

29:27.467 --> 29:29.368
We'll both find out at the sale, right?

29:31.230 --> 29:31.931
I hope so.

29:32.231 --> 29:35.054
You don't know what Brian is buying.

29:35.074 --> 29:35.634
You know where it's going.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.478
I hope so, and I hope sometime to see his collection.

29:39.618 --> 29:45.784
But from everything I hear, I hear that he's a great collector, a great lover of books.

29:47.465 --> 29:51.349
Yeah, but he's also built a museum or is building a museum for them.

29:51.650 --> 29:56.617
but nobody's really been in there.

29:56.637 --> 29:57.278
I like those really great books.

29:57.298 --> 29:59.361
At some point, they'll be for the public.

30:02.566 --> 30:03.367
Well, you wonder during your lifetime.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.270
Who knows?

30:05.290 --> 30:05.971
Yeah, who knows?

30:06.091 --> 30:06.492
I don't know.

30:06.532 --> 30:17.829
But I suspect that that gives the public a good shot at some point seeing them.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.091
Well, you know, people really hadn't had no idea where it was.

30:19.111 --> 30:20.152
The first piece was within a wonderful working time.

30:20.172 --> 30:20.593
It was an experiment.

30:21.417 --> 30:25.242
Oh, about 1909 or something like that.

30:25.643 --> 30:30.570
Everybody knew he was a great collector, but they really didn't know what he had.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.392
So there were parallels to that.

30:32.412 --> 30:33.414
Sure.

30:33.434 --> 30:35.617
I have a terrific Morgan book coming up in the sale.

30:35.797 --> 30:37.439
Actually, it's four books.

30:37.459 --> 30:37.920
Is that right?

30:38.100 --> 30:47.093
Yeah, what he did is he had printed on vellum 20 copies of his ivory miniature collection with a lot of scholarship.

30:47.173 --> 30:49.075
Copy number 12 is in the sale.

30:49.095 --> 30:50.157
Oh, great.

30:50.177 --> 30:50.277
Yeah.

30:50.527 --> 31:05.303
The other thing you should get from Susan is there's an article called Christy News, which is an interview with me on book collecting.

31:05.423 --> 31:06.624
You'd probably get a copy of that.

31:13.191 --> 31:14.432
Yeah, it's good.

31:14.492 --> 31:19.858
Yeah, 2405 Glendower, G-L-E-N-D-O-W-E-R,

31:20.328 --> 31:25.112
Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90027.

31:25.313 --> 31:28.616
I can reach your camera.

31:28.636 --> 31:29.156
Look at this phone number.

31:29.176 --> 31:31.819
This number, and in evenings it's 213-660-6718.

31:31.839 --> 31:33.700
Okay, I'm planning to come back out.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.561
I'd love to see Bill South again.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.632
He's got 23 presentation copies of Dickens, but we are here tonight.

31:46.652 --> 31:48.394
There's plenty of time that he's searching for some of us out there at the time, but...

31:48.728 --> 31:59.479
I really want to see his stuff.

31:59.499 --> 32:06.085
He's the fellow in the book of Tamerlane.

32:10.369 --> 32:10.950
His breath went to Tamerlane.

32:10.970 --> 32:11.050
Wow.

32:11.070 --> 32:11.711
He flew east just for that sail.

32:11.731 --> 32:12.171
This was a lovely guy.

32:12.191 --> 32:12.972
I went up and introduced myself to him.

32:12.992 --> 32:13.232
He ate this.

32:13.252 --> 32:13.352
Sure.

32:13.372 --> 32:13.853
I'd love to talk to you.

32:13.873 --> 32:14.513
I do want to go out and see him.

32:14.534 --> 32:15.514
And I decided to do some footage with Huntington.

32:15.535 --> 32:16.656
So if you see him, I hit the bucket below on his resume.

32:16.676 --> 32:17.216
I would have it at the tip.

32:17.236 --> 32:17.336
Sure.

32:17.356 --> 32:18.077
So this is a thorough job I'm doing.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.235
I'll tell you something else you ought to try to get a hold of, if you can.

32:30.815 --> 32:33.779
Get a copy of the Phoebe Boyle catalog.

32:33.799 --> 32:35.861
Get a book dealer if you find you want.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.766
A lot of the books in my sale were in that sale, too.

32:42.069 --> 32:45.973
Anderson Gallery, which was predecessor, of course, of Sotheby.

32:46.614 --> 32:47.235
1923.

32:47.295 --> 32:57.447
Oh, you do?

32:57.815 --> 33:07.026
Yeah, I'm going to whiteboard.

33:07.046 --> 33:07.607
I was 150 years old.

33:07.627 --> 33:10.410
I mean, they had these blue catalogs, suction catalogs.

33:10.430 --> 33:17.999
I found a criminal justice article about bibliocleptomedia, you know, from 19... Sure.

33:18.019 --> 33:18.700
...at the last school.

33:18.720 --> 33:23.826
I mean, just for wonderful little stories about... Well, you heard about this case out in the Midwest.

33:23.846 --> 33:25.668
It's about it stole 20,000 things.

33:25.689 --> 33:27.631
Did you hear about that case this summer?

33:27.651 --> 33:27.771
Uh-oh.

33:28.004 --> 33:34.171
The Steven Dunberg case, well, that's an extraordinary story.

33:34.391 --> 33:35.693
This guy stole 20,000 things just to keep.

33:35.893 --> 33:39.938
And the FBI both found the rest of them in March, was it?

33:39.958 --> 33:41.500
And they put a value of $40 million.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.761
Well, you know Glenn Dawson?

33:43.282 --> 33:43.682
Sure.

33:43.762 --> 33:44.443
We'll ask Glenn.

33:44.463 --> 33:45.624
Glenn was the expert.

33:45.644 --> 33:48.708
The FBI asked to come in and tell them that it was there.

33:48.728 --> 33:50.690
I did read something about that, yeah.

33:50.810 --> 33:51.151
Yeah.

33:51.391 --> 33:52.152
Glenn went there.

33:52.332 --> 33:53.433
Roger started it.

33:53.453 --> 33:55.636
Hope the library just got back.

33:55.656 --> 33:56.257
So I put Roger in next week.

33:56.277 --> 33:56.577
That's great.

33:56.962 --> 34:00.225
Incidentally, in this sale, you're going to find some Robert Ho books, too.

34:00.245 --> 34:01.727
Really?

34:01.747 --> 34:02.387
Yeah.

34:02.407 --> 34:06.471
There's a wonderful... You guys did some Robert Ho books.

34:06.491 --> 34:13.258
Boy, you really... Oh, I've got... Actually, they're mostly foreign books.

34:13.818 --> 34:17.522
There are two very intriguing French bindings in the sale that Ho had.

34:18.383 --> 34:23.728
And there is one of these silver gilt cage bindings.

34:24.468 --> 34:26.771
That was on a German book, but actually it's French.

34:26.791 --> 34:36.903
That was in the wholesale, which is the last one, the very last one at the end of my sale, and then there's a few French bindings of somebody else's in the sale.

34:37.704 --> 34:39.366
But that's from Robert Ho, too.

34:39.866 --> 34:47.656
And that's a beauty, and when I got it, it was tarnished, so I sent it to Asprey, and Asprey cleaned it in London.

34:48.076 --> 34:53.142
So you can tell I do really serious things to get everything in the perfect condition that I can get it in.

34:53.594 --> 34:57.579
And no looking back at all, no misgivings about this.

34:57.599 --> 34:59.922
I mean, you've crossed the Rubicon.

35:00.502 --> 35:01.403
Oh, yeah.

35:01.423 --> 35:01.684
Oh, yeah.

35:01.704 --> 35:05.248
No, I mean, I'm moving on to the next thing.

35:05.568 --> 35:07.010
Life is a movable feast.

35:08.712 --> 35:09.313
And what's next?

35:09.373 --> 35:11.736
What do you go after next?

35:11.756 --> 35:19.525
Oh, I think what I'm going to be going after next is, you know, I'm still active with this art foundation, still working with that.

35:19.625 --> 35:21.728
I mentioned there are four life artists of the club.

35:22.248 --> 35:26.632
One of them is still alive, and he's just donated his entire collection to the foundation.

35:26.652 --> 35:27.954
That's a million-dollar collection.

35:28.975 --> 35:29.996
So I'm real pleased with that.

35:30.076 --> 35:33.640
I've been working with that, getting museums now to show that collection.

35:34.701 --> 35:35.642
So I'm working on that.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.846
But in terms of collecting books, you think you're out of that?

35:39.866 --> 35:39.966
Yeah.

35:40.667 --> 35:44.010
I mean, I still have some nice books at home.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.334
Barry Moser is a guy I happen to like.

35:48.835 --> 35:50.837
I've got a lot of his materials.

35:51.442 --> 36:02.553
In fact, I bought his woodblocks, which I will eventually donate to museums, for Alice in Wonderland, a lot of those books.

36:02.633 --> 36:03.855
I own the original woodblocks.

36:05.436 --> 36:09.981
And in fact, Dartmouth now has them on loan from me, the Alice woodblocks.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.565
But I've got a lot of his woodblocks.

36:13.585 --> 36:17.989
But Barry's a major guy, another person I've interviewed.

36:18.323 --> 36:20.286
I talked to Barry.

36:22.849 --> 36:23.770
I thought I had heard that he was a collector.

36:23.790 --> 36:27.555
He said he really is, to me, collects things for functional purposes, but not really for obsessive purposes.

36:27.575 --> 36:32.541
But Leonard Baskin is quite a collector.

36:32.561 --> 36:34.103
And I've interviewed Lenny and his wife.

36:34.123 --> 36:34.604
They're both collectors.

36:34.624 --> 36:35.305
Oh, is that right?

36:35.485 --> 36:35.986
I've seen it.

36:36.086 --> 36:38.849
I almost bought one of his sculptures.

36:38.989 --> 36:39.130
Yeah.

36:39.150 --> 36:41.893
Well, his book collecting is not really known.

36:41.913 --> 36:43.335
I'll be the first one I've ever heard about.

36:44.817 --> 36:46.359
There's another thing here, right?

36:46.800 --> 36:47.541
Oh, it's a lot.

36:47.561 --> 36:48.623
I'm looking forward to your book.

36:48.783 --> 36:49.745
Well, it's going to be fun.

36:49.765 --> 36:51.347
And I'll even tell you what the title is.

36:51.367 --> 36:56.175
The title is A Gentle Madness.

36:56.195 --> 36:56.816
Oh, I like that.

36:56.876 --> 36:57.678
Yeah, it's good.

36:57.898 --> 37:00.161
In fact, I don't sell the book.

37:00.182 --> 37:10.538
I derive that from when Isaiah Thomas, whose collection became the American Quarantine Society here in Worcestershire, so it's kind of tipping my hat to an institution down the street.

37:10.720 --> 37:19.154
When he died, his grandson sucked up.

37:19.434 --> 37:24.543
My grandfather was afflicted with the gentlest of infirmities.

37:24.563 --> 37:25.404
He was a big wheeled maniac.

37:25.424 --> 37:25.564
Uh-huh.

37:25.584 --> 37:26.125
So I kind of modified that.

37:26.145 --> 37:29.911
When I interviewed Colin Freyburn in Oxford, England, you may know, he's quite an important deal.

37:29.931 --> 37:30.031
Sure.

37:30.052 --> 37:31.394
He said, oh, I rather like the gentlest of infirmities.

37:31.414 --> 37:32.696
Well, he's a scholar, yeah.

37:32.816 --> 37:34.919
I said, Colin, I said, that's English.

37:34.939 --> 37:35.901
I said, Americans from...

37:36.100 --> 37:38.582
identify with Magnus.

37:38.822 --> 37:39.423
You're so right.

37:39.443 --> 37:43.867
The difference between the English and the Americans, I mean, they don't like adjectives.

37:43.907 --> 37:46.109
They don't like powerful words.

37:46.249 --> 37:48.571
Everything is understatement.

37:48.591 --> 37:49.332
Exactly.

37:50.112 --> 38:00.902
And actually, I toyed with that, and I discussed it with my editor at Random House to sit down.

38:00.922 --> 38:04.625
I'll stick with the general manager to have a subtitle, Excursions on Book Collectors, not interviews with, but Excursions on Book Collectors, past and present.

38:04.645 --> 38:06.006
They'll be shooting back and forth to probably hold on a few things.

38:07.083 --> 38:17.615
John Carter Brown, and Jeremy Belnapp, opening shooting forward to people such as yourself, and Lady Apple, William Scheide, and Carter Burton.

38:17.635 --> 38:17.955
We had some fun.

38:17.975 --> 38:20.298
Now, Carter Burton, his first name is Shirley, right?

38:20.338 --> 38:20.938
No, no, Carter.

38:21.379 --> 38:24.863
No, but I think his first name is Shirley Carter Burton.

38:24.883 --> 38:26.024
He probably dropped the Shirley.

38:26.925 --> 38:27.706
He went to Harvard.

38:28.407 --> 38:33.232
He went to Harvard, and then he went to Columbia Law, and he was married to Paley?

38:34.233 --> 38:34.814
Precisely.

38:35.675 --> 38:35.875
Yeah.

38:36.142 --> 38:36.883
Blonde.

38:36.903 --> 38:39.768
I don't know if he's blonde anymore, but he was.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.732
Yeah, he was in my class at law school.

38:43.433 --> 38:44.355
Maybe he dropped out.

38:45.697 --> 38:48.562
He may have dropped out, but he was in my first year class at law school.

38:48.602 --> 38:56.855
Yeah.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.859
And his first name is Shirley.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.542
Yep.

39:02.720 --> 39:08.409
Okay, say Paul, and I look forward to meeting you, too.

39:08.649 --> 39:16.000
Okay, Nick, and we'll see you next week.

39:16.020 --> 39:16.721
You bet.

39:16.741 --> 39:21.148
Thank you so much for your time.

39:21.168 --> 39:21.609
Okay.

39:21.669 --> 39:23.291
Appreciate it.

39:23.852 --> 39:24.373
Bye.
