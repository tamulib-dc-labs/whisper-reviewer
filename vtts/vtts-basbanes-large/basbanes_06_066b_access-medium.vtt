WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:32.468
I guess what I really have to be brought up today, though, we're talking Aaron Lansing, it's two and a half years since we spoke, and I think when we talked the first time, I guess what you have done here was largely responsible for Yiddish being taught in a number of institutions, and the number is really not in here, but I think you said about 16, or it might have been 660 is what the college figure is, but we actually have a student working also,

00:32.836 --> 00:33.797
trying to confirm this.

00:34.258 --> 00:35.660
And I don't know how far she's gotten.

00:35.740 --> 00:38.865
It's probably not quite that many in reality.

00:38.885 --> 00:40.707
That's a commonly used number.

00:40.788 --> 00:42.610
What number would you... Forty, say.

00:43.011 --> 00:44.333
So let's say about 40.

00:44.593 --> 00:46.676
As a credit course.

00:46.896 --> 00:47.598
As a credit course.

00:47.658 --> 00:49.500
But it's being taught.

00:49.580 --> 00:53.546
Now, the most prominent example, of course, is Yale.

00:53.566 --> 00:56.070
And I guess that continues to be the most prominent example.

00:56.090 --> 01:01.678
There were about 10,000 volumes, I guess, which you said that election was more significant than we ever could have.

01:02.401 --> 01:08.390
What the Yale collection did was to legitimize the whole notion that Yiddish belonged in major university libraries.

01:08.410 --> 01:09.832
That was a major gift, as you know.

01:09.952 --> 01:14.779
It was a $200,000 gift, and it was a very important deal.

01:14.799 --> 01:16.542
Yale was one of the major libraries in the world.

01:16.582 --> 01:19.466
They had not had significant Yiddish holdings up until now.

01:20.087 --> 01:28.179
When Yale did it, it, in effect, announced to everybody else that if you really want to have a major research library, you're really going to have collections of world literature.

01:28.199 --> 01:30.062
Yiddish has to be part of that collection.

01:30.565 --> 01:34.231
So since then, we have set up an enormous number of collections.

01:34.571 --> 01:37.997
I think we're up to 150 libraries around the world now that we're dealing with.

01:38.017 --> 01:40.961
When I spoke to you two years ago, it might have been, I don't know, 30 or 40.

01:40.981 --> 01:42.604
Well, of course, the Cold War was still on.

01:42.624 --> 01:45.849
Now you have readier access, I guess, to Eastern Europe, which is changing.

01:45.869 --> 01:46.991
Yeah, but it's actually not there.

01:47.051 --> 01:51.378
These are all major university and research libraries in the United States, Europe, Japan.

01:51.418 --> 01:52.860
No kidding.

01:52.992 --> 01:53.873
Japan.

01:53.893 --> 01:54.574
Yeah.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.275
Even Japan.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.098
Can you name me an institution in Japan?

01:58.178 --> 01:58.758
I can look it up.

01:58.779 --> 02:00.941
I think it's the University of Tokyo or whatever.

02:01.882 --> 02:04.405
There's a professor there who is an ethnic Korean.

02:05.987 --> 02:10.572
And he said that as an ethnic Korean, he began studying European history.

02:10.592 --> 02:14.796
And he was an ethnic Korean, knowing what it means to live on the outside of Japanese society.

02:15.457 --> 02:20.603
When he started to study the history of Europe, he was naturally gravitated towards the history of Jews.

02:20.752 --> 02:23.195
because he could identify with their experience very directly.

02:23.836 --> 02:33.587
And once he began doing that, although still the mainstream of Jewish scholarship looks away from Yiddish and still looks towards, you know, religion and theology and that kind of thing.

02:34.108 --> 02:36.270
And he looked, well, I want to understand the Jews of Europe.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.613
I've got to understand them in their own language or towards Yiddish.

02:39.133 --> 02:42.397
And he went out to talk himself Yiddish, and now he teaches courses there.

02:42.578 --> 02:46.422
The number, the figure that you gave me,

02:47.465 --> 02:52.810
Yiddish as a language is not even 200 years old.

02:52.830 --> 02:53.271
No, no.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.612
The language is about a thousand years old.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.794
That's what you're saying here, a thousand years.

02:56.814 --> 02:59.257
But where does the two-century figure come in?

02:59.277 --> 03:00.298
It's the literature itself.

03:00.418 --> 03:00.758
Okay.

03:01.619 --> 03:02.680
That's very important.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.382
The language itself.

03:04.422 --> 03:05.743
I was looking at that.

03:05.883 --> 03:07.225
We get two sets of figures here.

03:07.305 --> 03:09.166
The language itself is about a thousand years old.

03:09.827 --> 03:12.730
But for almost the entire period of its history,

03:12.929 --> 03:25.366
Jews have always, wherever they have lived, maintained a system of a linguist called internal bilingualism, which means that wherever they are, they maintain at least two Jewish languages of their own, in addition to whatever indigenous languages they might speak.

03:26.107 --> 03:28.490
In this case, Hebrew is always one of them.

03:28.550 --> 03:32.075
Hebrew, and to a lesser extent, Aramaic, are the holy languages.

03:32.155 --> 03:34.899
That's the language of scholarship, language of prayer.

03:35.620 --> 03:41.147
But the spoken languages, vernacular, usually a Jewish version of the indigenous language, which in our case is Yiddish,

03:41.701 --> 03:52.094
But because it is that kind of dichotomy, as long as the traditional Jewish world prevailed, scholars, that is, educated men, spent their time studying legalistic texts in Hebrew, that's what you were expecting.

03:52.195 --> 03:53.997
Almost had the same parallel of Latin.

03:54.017 --> 03:56.420
That's right, very, very, exactly analogous.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.143
In Yiddish, it's vernacular.

03:59.164 --> 04:08.856
So the only literature in Yiddish during most of that period was what was called Viber Literature, V-I-B-E-R, which means women's literature, which,

04:09.005 --> 04:12.970
was supposedly, see, women would not have been expected to learn Hebrew.

04:13.771 --> 04:20.941
And as a result, this was didactic literature for women and for uneducated men who were not able to read Hebrew.

04:22.042 --> 04:26.949
Didactic literature in the sense that it would retell biblical stories or popular tales, always with a moral.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.472
But it was very limited.

04:29.592 --> 04:31.515
There was a limited range of that literature.

04:32.016 --> 04:36.902
It was only in the late 19th century when the old Jewish world finally began to break apart that all of this changed.

04:37.372 --> 04:53.196
As long as the old Jewish world, based in Talmudic law, remains intact, based in concentrated communities, Jews, a kind of separate people, a separate class within a feudal society, as long as all that was in place, everything was okay, and Yiddish had a very limited literary role.

04:53.857 --> 04:59.245
In the mid-19th century, in Eastern Europe, in Russia and Poland,

04:59.663 --> 05:00.784
Everything began to change.

05:00.824 --> 05:07.453
The ideas of Western Enlightenment, 100 years late, started to make their way into Eastern Europe at that point, particularly among the Jewish community.

05:08.374 --> 05:14.942
And so reason becomes a factor, and we say, you know, we can figure out for ourselves what it means to, you know, live a decent human life.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.887
We don't need to abide by the dictates of the minutiae of Tom Wood's laws.

05:18.948 --> 05:20.149
People are starting to say this.

05:20.670 --> 05:21.891
The economy is changing.

05:21.931 --> 05:26.397
Feudalism starts to break down, and scholars start, I'm sorry, and so

05:26.714 --> 05:32.181
there's now a chance for mobility, limited, but some mobility within a society which wasn't present before.

05:32.762 --> 05:37.989
And also the idea of Jews living in fairly discreet communities also begins to break down.

05:38.189 --> 05:39.872
Jews are moving out into large cities.

05:40.432 --> 05:48.383
There's a gradual industrialization, small industry, like making clothing, that kind of stuff.

05:48.423 --> 05:50.967
But nonetheless, the Jews are moving into cities in larger numbers.

05:51.407 --> 05:54.291
And then after 1881, when the Russian Tsar was assassinated,

05:54.592 --> 05:56.594
Jews were actually expelled from the villages.

05:57.896 --> 05:59.418
They were forced into the cities.

05:59.959 --> 06:05.725
So suddenly, all the traditional patterns break down, and Jews have to figure out how one lives in a modern world.

06:05.806 --> 06:07.247
How do you live in an industrial world?

06:07.287 --> 06:11.232
How do you live in a world where you're no longer defining your Jewishness by Talmudic law?

06:11.252 --> 06:14.016
It's no longer automatically defined, as it were.

06:14.716 --> 06:18.641
And to that point, the intellectuals have to kind of struggle for a literary language.

06:19.362 --> 06:24.328
The first thing they do is return to Hebrew, because Hebrew was legitimate.

06:24.663 --> 06:28.428
They're called Maschilim, these proponents of enlightenment in the Jewish world.

06:29.529 --> 06:30.430
It's M-A-S-K-I-L-I-M.

06:31.031 --> 06:36.838
The Maschilim set out, and first they turned to Hebrew because Hebrew's classical.

06:36.858 --> 06:43.607
I mean, don't forget the 17th century Harvard University's commencement addresses weren't Hebrew, or the seal of Yale University had Hebrew on it.

06:43.627 --> 06:44.788
It was a classical language.

06:44.868 --> 06:45.850
Is it going to continue?

06:46.551 --> 06:48.253
The Yale seal still does?

06:48.273 --> 06:48.793
Yes, it still does.

06:48.873 --> 06:49.334
Oh, that's funny.

06:49.354 --> 06:49.654
Oh, yeah.

06:50.075 --> 06:51.717
Yeah, biblical Hebrew on the seal.

06:51.916 --> 06:59.083
So, you know, the classical language along with Latin and Greek, it was pre-diaspora, and therefore it was legitimate.

06:59.223 --> 07:01.385
It had all the kind of... Sacred.

07:01.885 --> 07:05.769
Yeah, all the cachet of the way the Christian world viewed the Old Testament.

07:05.909 --> 07:08.752
The Hebrew had all that kind of... Caracad.

07:08.772 --> 07:10.493
Yeah, all that recognition going for it.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.554
Yiddish had none of that.

07:11.714 --> 07:20.843
Yiddish was the language of the Jewish masses, the language of women, everything about Jews that was backwards, as it was perceived at that time, that was culturally specific.

07:21.481 --> 07:28.455
Of course, what happens is these must give them right in Hebrew to enlighten the masses, but the masses that they're trying to enlighten don't read Hebrew.

07:28.635 --> 07:29.637
They're not well-educated.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.539
They don't read Hebrew.

07:30.960 --> 07:42.763
And the graduates, now we're talking like 1850s, early 1860s, one by one, some of these writers begin to get the idea that if we're really going to educate the masses, we have to do it in their own language, which is Yiddish.

07:42.946 --> 07:44.668
reach them.

07:45.068 --> 07:49.954
Here's a great problem, of course, because Yiddish is antithetical to everything they're trying to do.

07:49.974 --> 07:56.581
It's this kind of new universalist, you know, classical vision they're trying to put forth there, enlightened vision.

07:56.761 --> 08:00.205
They see Yiddish as the antithesis of this, so it's a kind of necessary evil.

08:00.225 --> 08:01.667
Well, it tells them we're secular, too.

08:01.727 --> 08:03.709
Yeah, well, yes, but these are already sensitive.

08:03.729 --> 08:07.293
These are people who have already broken the traditional world and are now doing this.

08:07.873 --> 08:09.375
So what ends up happening is that

08:09.980 --> 08:11.804
First, it's kind of a necessary evil.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.407
They don't really like this idea at all.

08:14.570 --> 08:27.718
But, you know, the medium is the message, and it's only a matter of time, within 10 years, about the 1860s now, that a number of important writers, including the most important of all, the Mendele-Moychus Forum, who was the grandfather of the literature,

08:28.103 --> 08:31.366
Mandela writes in Yiddish as a necessary evil to reach the masses.

08:31.506 --> 08:32.127
Did he say this?

08:32.347 --> 08:33.388
Oh, yeah, explicitly.

08:33.588 --> 08:37.352
But he starts to enjoy it, and he starts to like the language, and he realizes what it can do.

08:37.813 --> 08:43.258
And the more that he kind of mimics the masses to make fun of them in their own language, the more he realizes its artistic potential.

08:43.278 --> 08:45.020
Where would I find that quote from him, you know?

08:45.580 --> 08:47.202
Because there's something I could cite.

08:47.562 --> 08:48.823
Yeah.

08:48.844 --> 08:49.865
That would be wonderful.

08:49.885 --> 08:50.585
Go back out again.

08:50.605 --> 08:50.926
Stay again.

08:50.946 --> 08:51.927
What he talks about.

08:51.947 --> 08:52.407
I'm sorry.

08:52.667 --> 08:57.452
What Mandela speaks about here is

08:59.305 --> 09:06.374
his own reasons for not writing in Yiddish earlier is how it begins.

09:08.997 --> 09:11.120
Now, is it alright if I quit note this, by the way?

09:11.140 --> 09:11.760
Of course, of course.

09:11.780 --> 09:14.484
And this is an unpublished thesis, so I'll leave the title page, too.

09:14.504 --> 09:15.945
Yeah, alright.

09:15.965 --> 09:18.829
We'll do all that before we leave here.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.471
I've got a couple.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.233
I've got Bill Reese's thesis, too.

09:22.293 --> 09:22.714
Oh, good, okay.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.276
Yeah, I was very interested in that period.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.397
I only write about

09:25.900 --> 09:31.024
four years of Mendel, the first four years of his work, because it's at that point that I see the transition taking place.

09:31.505 --> 09:53.103
As I see it, what he ends up doing is the more he becomes aware of the artistic possibilities of the language, the more his whole kind of social theory is transformed as well, and the more he comes to identity, instead of spreading kind of bourgeois liberal enlightenment to the masses, he begins to defend the masses in their own political and economic struggles, because he identifies with them aesthetically as well.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.705
It's an interesting transformation that takes place.

09:56.005 --> 10:02.917
Anyway, the result of all of this is that Mendelof starts writing in Yiddish, first reads the masses, understands its artistic potential.

10:03.398 --> 10:05.281
Other writers begin to see the same thing.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.645
And these are all sophisticated intellectuals.

10:08.286 --> 10:13.715
At least until the 20th century, there was no Yiddish writer who was not conversing with many other languages.

10:14.717 --> 10:19.565
Most of these people were living their lives, although they grew up speaking Yiddish, were living their lives in other languages.

10:20.106 --> 10:21.388
But we're so...

10:21.638 --> 10:26.307
enamored of the artistic possibilities inherent within Yiddish that they began writing in it.

10:26.327 --> 10:33.240
They understood that there was something in that voice that could express a point of view that they could never express in Russian or in Hebrew or in other languages.

10:33.741 --> 10:36.006
And so suddenly the literature burst forth at that point.

10:36.506 --> 10:41.195
Mendel's first novel is 1864, and that's usually seen as the start of modern Yiddish literature.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.298
It's only a hundred years?

10:42.318 --> 10:44.021
125 years old.

10:44.241 --> 10:44.642
That's all.

10:44.842 --> 10:45.643
It's nothing.

10:45.723 --> 10:46.444
I agree with you.

10:46.465 --> 10:46.945
I know.

10:46.965 --> 10:50.851
It's a very modern literature, and what happened... I was dying when you came along.

10:50.871 --> 10:52.213
I know, but that's why.

10:53.475 --> 11:00.787
He starts in 1864, and by 1939, when the Nazis invade Poland, of course, that's an enormous bloat that the literature never recovers from.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.052
And even had enough for that, there were questions about what would have happened.

11:05.574 --> 11:11.203
But in that very brief period of time, let's say between the 1880s and 1940, roughly,

11:12.010 --> 11:14.333
When I spoke to you before, I probably gave you a title.

11:14.614 --> 11:17.578
I thought there were 40,000 titles in Yiddish literature.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.302
We now think there are 50,000 titles in Yiddish literature.

11:20.322 --> 11:21.724
This has just been revised upward.

11:22.625 --> 11:25.729
If there's a bibliography, it's in this building, right?

11:25.749 --> 11:27.332
It's something that you people can buy.

11:27.352 --> 11:28.373
Well, we have a lot of it.

11:28.553 --> 11:31.838
Of course, there's the YIVO Institute in New York, which is a Yiddish research library.

11:31.878 --> 11:33.240
Can I talk to somebody about that?

11:33.260 --> 11:33.400
Yeah.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.463
There's a really knowledgeable person to speak with there.

11:35.483 --> 11:37.386
Zachary Baker is the head librarian.

11:37.406 --> 11:37.847
Zachary?

11:38.708 --> 11:38.828
Right.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.176
And what's the name of the institution again?

11:42.196 --> 11:45.720
This is called the YIVO, Y-I-V-O, Institute for Jewish Research.

11:46.021 --> 11:48.664
This is the major Yiddish research institute in the world.

11:49.185 --> 11:53.952
It was founded in Vilnius in Lithuania in 1925.

11:54.012 --> 11:54.492
Exactly.

11:54.512 --> 11:56.255
You will give me some quotes about what you're doing.

11:56.275 --> 11:56.795
That's right.

11:56.815 --> 11:57.616
Of course you will.

11:57.877 --> 11:59.279
We work very closely with them.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.522
Actually, that's a story in itself.

12:01.582 --> 12:03.464
This is your story, right?

12:03.484 --> 12:04.065
I know.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.029
I can tell you really quickly about the YIVO archive.

12:07.089 --> 12:09.152
This is not so much books, but archival materials.

12:09.537 --> 12:21.508
The Nazis took over the Evo in 1941 when they invaded Vilna, and they forced a number of the scholars there to work for them because they wanted to create this record of the people who were destroyed, kind of like what we do with American Indians.

12:21.528 --> 12:26.613
I mean, they had this idea they were going to make a museum of the Jewish scholars.

12:26.853 --> 12:27.794
Yeah, exactly.

12:27.894 --> 12:32.218
So they forced these scholars to work for them, but the scholars, very heroic, they were smuggling books out of the building.

12:32.258 --> 12:33.359
Oh, I like this story.

12:33.939 --> 12:35.141
Yeah, it's a great story.

12:35.161 --> 12:37.823
In a way, it's a nice precursor for others also.

12:38.140 --> 12:42.867
They smuggled books out of the building, and they hid them in milk cans and buried them in the Vilna ghetto.

12:42.987 --> 12:44.088
Where can I find out about this?

12:44.108 --> 12:45.270
Zachary will tell you all about it.

12:46.131 --> 12:49.456
And after the war, even the American troops came in.

12:49.476 --> 12:54.563
They liberated a lot of that material, shifted back, forth, and then it was just reconstituted in New York City.

12:55.124 --> 12:57.507
And some of it still ended up in the hands of the Soviets.

12:57.988 --> 12:58.609
That's an end!

12:58.809 --> 12:59.771
And it was still there.

12:59.831 --> 13:01.814
This is really the whole story.

13:02.555 --> 13:04.958
I hadn't gone to the Soviet Union yet when I spoke to you, right?

13:05.208 --> 13:08.132
You had, I think, just the first trip, maybe.

13:08.152 --> 13:10.015
Yeah, then we went with a second expedition as well.

13:10.035 --> 13:11.337
What was the date you had?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.158
February of 19th.

13:12.178 --> 13:15.543
February, so I hadn't gone with a second expedition there.

13:15.563 --> 13:17.506
In Vilna... Don't forget to give me your number.

13:17.526 --> 13:17.706
Oh, sure.

13:17.767 --> 13:31.487
In Vilna, there is a, I think it's like an old cathedral or a monastery or something, and there's a great big church, and the Soviets had used this as a place to stash away books and stuff, and it's amazing.

13:31.507 --> 13:35.012
It's this cathedral, and books have piled up, you know, 20, 30 feet high.

13:35.431 --> 13:36.973
We just were able to get into it.

13:37.013 --> 13:41.820
Twenty, thirty feet high, these mountains of books in all different languages, but many Jewish books among them.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.185
How do you feel when you see something like that?

13:46.467 --> 13:57.822
I guess one stands in awe of the magnitude of human creativity and also the magnitude of human ignorance and indifference to bash all these things away like that.

13:57.842 --> 13:58.784
See, you have it.

13:58.844 --> 14:01.067
You have the virus.

14:01.233 --> 14:08.463
I make no apologies about loving books, believe me, but I see that, you know.

14:08.623 --> 14:10.526
I'm also interested in what's inside the books.

14:10.626 --> 14:14.992
And that's what makes it clear, and that's how we bring in Charles.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.374
And I also got Father Monaghan.

14:16.394 --> 14:18.557
You ever heard of Father Monaghan from the University?

14:18.617 --> 14:19.018
Wonderful.

14:19.338 --> 14:22.022
They call him the Penalas Medici of San Francisco.

14:22.042 --> 14:29.352
He got no money, and he goes out and he's just, well, that's another story, as we say, but it's great.

14:29.432 --> 14:30.193
I've got the Catholic guy.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.183
Great, all right, good.

14:34.203 --> 14:36.727
Okay, Zachary's number, 212-535-6700.

14:36.887 --> 14:51.967
Now, is this stuff, interestingly enough, is this the kind of material, does anybody who collects the material, the hateful material, does anybody collect them?

14:52.447 --> 14:55.371
I know Yeshiva, for instance, has the famous

14:55.773 --> 15:02.840
the Council of Trent document, which... Yeah, but I mean, the American paper material... Well, anything, I mean, the Council of Trent document.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.622
In Jamaica is what it's called, yeah.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.382
Is that what it's called?

15:05.543 --> 15:05.683
Yeah.

15:05.703 --> 15:07.384
But somebody has to preserve this.

15:07.885 --> 15:08.345
Yeah.

15:08.365 --> 15:08.646
I don't know.

15:09.106 --> 15:09.486
Okay.

15:09.627 --> 15:11.228
That's where you can tell you that.

15:11.829 --> 15:14.291
I know that the B'nai Rift in America has an arc.

15:14.311 --> 15:15.572
Okay, that would make sense.

15:15.592 --> 15:17.855
It has a library of... That's what comes out here.

15:17.995 --> 15:18.575
Yeah.

15:18.595 --> 15:20.017
Okay, go on with you.

15:20.277 --> 15:25.442
Anyway, to the Evo story itself, it's a very interesting one, because there really was real heroism in saving books there.

15:25.743 --> 15:35.415
Also, when YIVO was first constituted, this is kind of a connection here, when YIVO was first constituted in 1925, it was convened by a number of the leading Jewish intellectuals of the day.

15:35.896 --> 15:44.266
It's very hard for us today to realize how uncollected all these materials had been up until that point.

15:45.127 --> 15:53.117
But, as I said, the main occurrence of Jewish scholarship at that time came out of Germany, a fairly assimilationist or apologetic model.

15:53.519 --> 15:58.747
tended to focus on ideas and religion, not on Jews, not on the social history of the Jewish people.

15:59.568 --> 16:15.091
For example, I'll come around with this, but for example, in the 1860s, when Heinrich Gretz, G-R-A-T-Z, who was the great Jewish historian of the 19th century, living in Germany, he wrote a six-volume history of the Jews, a definitive history of the Jews until that point.

16:15.952 --> 16:19.037
At that point, about 80% of the Jews in the world were speaking Yiddish.

16:19.537 --> 16:22.682
He accorded Yiddish exactly two paragraphs out of the sixth volume.

16:23.202 --> 16:26.265
And in those two paragraphs, he characterized Yiddish writing in German.

16:27.026 --> 16:30.670
He said, he said, it's a half-yiddish sprache.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.791
You know what they said?

16:31.932 --> 16:33.073
Right, yeah, right.

16:33.113 --> 16:35.636
A half-beastial tongue.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.217
Is that what he said?

16:37.237 --> 16:38.979
Yeah, it was really a terrible denigration.

16:38.999 --> 16:39.720
That's how he translated it?

16:39.740 --> 16:39.840
Yeah.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.944
Beastial tongue, the animal tongue.

16:42.964 --> 16:44.946
So there's a terrible denigration that took place.

16:44.966 --> 16:47.809
But these scholars in Eastern Europe began slowly to realize

16:48.312 --> 16:56.541
And the greatest of them, the person who's really always been my intellectual mentor was a man named Simon Dubnov, D-U-B-N-O-W.

16:56.561 --> 16:59.504
Yeah, Dubnov was the great Jewish historian in the 20th century.

16:59.565 --> 17:06.292
Eventually, he was 81 years old, and he was murdered in Riga in 1941, actually by a Latvian militia.

17:08.014 --> 17:17.965
But Dubnov began early on collecting materials, and he organized a network of what he called zamblers, which means collectors, to start collecting documents from their own communities.

17:18.265 --> 17:25.334
Z-A-M-L-E-R-M, to start collecting materials from their own communities and shipping them to a central point.

17:25.434 --> 17:26.896
Is there a biography, Tim?

17:26.916 --> 17:27.116
Yeah.

17:27.657 --> 17:29.039
There's a new biography that just came out.

17:29.119 --> 17:31.843
You'll find it in any library that just came out.

17:31.903 --> 17:32.664
D-U-B-N-L-W.

17:32.744 --> 17:33.204
N-L-W, yeah.

17:33.224 --> 17:34.306
Do you know the title of it?

17:34.326 --> 17:36.629
I think it's called A Life Assignment.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.211
I'm not positive for that.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.212
I'm going to hire him this week.

17:39.232 --> 17:39.753
Okay.

17:39.773 --> 17:43.738
There's also an older book where you'll get information more easily.

17:44.078 --> 17:46.922
There's a book by Dugna,

17:47.307 --> 17:55.574
called Nationalism and History, and it has a long introduction by Koppel Tinson, P-I-N-S-O-N, and he'll tell the whole story in there.

17:55.594 --> 17:57.276
Okay, Nationalism and History.

17:58.237 --> 17:59.718
Who's the author of that again?

17:59.818 --> 18:04.662
Dumno's the author, but Tinson is the one who edited it, and he had the introduction, Koppel.

18:04.682 --> 18:04.782
Good.

18:06.304 --> 18:09.026
We could go on all day with all these stories, but I'll just tell you a little more.

18:09.847 --> 18:16.673
So Dumno set up this network of Zamblers, and when YIVA was established in 2005, they took over his Zambler network, expanded it,

18:17.041 --> 18:25.934
And there ended up being these kind of, used to call them hallowed intelligentsia, half-intellectuals, all over the countryside, all these little shetlocks, these little towns, all over Eastern Europe.

18:25.954 --> 18:27.797
There were hundreds of thousands of these towns.

18:28.498 --> 18:33.165
And these people would collect the minutes of their communal societies going back a hundred years.

18:33.185 --> 18:35.869
Whatever they could find, they were sending this material into medieval.

18:36.550 --> 18:41.517
And then it was a lot of this material that then survived the war and was shipped to New York and is now there.

18:41.717 --> 18:43.320
I'm going to have to get out and see this guy.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.922
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a very good guy.

18:45.188 --> 18:48.312
I go to see everything, by the way.

18:48.893 --> 18:50.815
Zachary is a really good guy.

18:50.875 --> 18:54.920
He's extremely knowledgeable.

18:56.282 --> 18:57.524
We have an arrangement with Ivo.

18:57.544 --> 19:04.953
When we started the book center, we recognized that there had to be one definitive Yiddish research library in the world where there was a copy of absolutely everything.

19:05.634 --> 19:09.819
So we made an arrangement with Ivo where we maintained what we call permanent loan collection there.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.744
Whenever we collect books, as soon as we accession them, we send lists to Ivo,

19:14.146 --> 19:14.867
They go through them.

19:14.907 --> 19:17.269
Anything that's not in the YIVO library, we send it free.

19:17.309 --> 19:24.117
We retain title, but we send it on indefinite loan, and it becomes part of the YIVO research.

19:24.397 --> 19:28.262
And then the books stay there forever and ever, and that way they're always accessible.

19:28.282 --> 19:29.743
So we've been very careful to do that.

19:30.204 --> 19:44.119
But anyways, when I started at the Book Center, having been really such a strong intellectual influence on me, as an undergraduate and later in graduate school, he always kind of shaped my own thinking about Jewish history and what it meant.

19:44.437 --> 19:48.142
As a result of that, I knew full well what he had done with Zamblers.

19:49.304 --> 20:00.861
And when I started the Book Center, I figured, hmm, maybe we could revive this idea that Dubnov had used, you know, whatever it was, 75 years before or 60 years before, that perhaps I could revive this idea here.

20:00.881 --> 20:04.746
And so I organized, in America and Canada, a network of Zamblers all over again.

20:05.287 --> 20:12.317
But in this case, collecting not archival materials, but books themselves.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.418
And we now have a network of almost 200 people all over North America.

20:16.498 --> 20:17.459
Have you all collected?

20:17.679 --> 20:18.861
Yeah, and this is how we collect it.

20:18.921 --> 20:22.205
A lot of publicity.

20:22.525 --> 20:23.347
I go up on the road.

20:23.387 --> 20:26.070
I spend a lot of time on the roads lecturing.

20:26.090 --> 20:28.573
Just let me interrupt for a second, but go ahead.

20:29.014 --> 20:29.715
Okay.

20:29.735 --> 20:34.300
So what I did in fact was to recreate the Nozama network in North America.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.363
And I say these people now are all over the continent.

20:36.403 --> 20:42.591
What we do is we send them a packet telling them how to collect books and how to launch a local Yiddish book collection drive.

20:43.077 --> 20:46.302
And we send them press releases that they can send to their local papers.

20:46.322 --> 20:47.484
They just put their name into it.

20:48.065 --> 20:53.914
And we send them posters they can put around.

20:53.934 --> 20:55.737
I'm in my office.

20:55.757 --> 20:59.062
Could you bring me a copy of a Zambler's packet with the press release and all?

21:01.205 --> 21:01.866
Yeah, okay.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.670
Let me tell you a little more about the Zambler Center.

21:04.691 --> 21:08.196
The Zambler Center have been collecting books all over the country.

21:08.216 --> 21:09.298
They've been extraordinary.

21:09.378 --> 21:11.481
There are some amazing people who do this work.

21:12.035 --> 21:14.618
I'll give you a few examples of the people who are still alive.

21:15.058 --> 21:21.284
A lot of our examples have passed on since the older people, and now there are a lot of younger people doing this.

21:21.605 --> 21:24.488
When Pearl Ann is the organizer, you'll talk to her for a minute.

21:27.651 --> 21:38.582
For example, there's a woman who lived in an old commune of left-wing Jews, mostly Jewish, Yiddish-speaking anarchists, that was up in Peekskill, New York, in Crompile, New York, named Sorel Skolnik.

21:39.068 --> 21:42.572
When we met her, she was probably already in her early 80s when we first began.

21:43.193 --> 21:49.460
But a woman with amazing dignity and extraordinarily strong and poised and intelligent, well-educated woman.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.603
Worked all her life as a seamstress, you know, making her a living.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.225
But she used to teach at night.

21:54.245 --> 21:58.991
She had a great love of Yiddish and Russian literature and used to teach two nights a week courses in each literature.

21:59.751 --> 22:02.855
And when she heard about us, she became one of our most active Zamblers.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.498
A woman, utterly unsentiment, but really

22:05.900 --> 22:09.043
You know, a real profound people's intellectual.

22:09.744 --> 22:14.689
And she had an old car, she had an old Dodge Dart, like a 60-something Dodge Dart.

22:14.709 --> 22:19.134
And she started driving all over Westchester County, collected thousands of books for her.

22:19.154 --> 22:22.377
And she had a stroke, unfortunately, but she's still alive.

22:22.397 --> 22:23.358
What's her name once again?

22:23.919 --> 22:27.603
S-O-R-E-L-L, S-O-R-E-L-L, S-K-O-L-N-I-K.

22:28.123 --> 22:30.005
Okay, can I name her?

22:30.146 --> 22:31.307
Oh, absolutely.

22:31.327 --> 22:32.448
To pay credit to her?

22:33.189 --> 22:33.409
Absolutely.

22:33.457 --> 22:42.467
Yeah, and another person was, well, there's a person named Jacob Schaefer, who was actually just out here for a program, S-C-H-A-E-F-E-R.

22:42.988 --> 22:43.228
Why not?

22:43.749 --> 22:44.830
Yes.

22:45.331 --> 22:50.737
Jacob was a survivor, came from the city of Kovnev, Kamis, in Latvia, survived the Holocaust.

22:50.797 --> 22:53.881
His wife and his five children were killed in Auschwitz, but he survived.

22:54.461 --> 22:58.706
Came to America, worked all his life as a tailor in New York City.

22:58.726 --> 23:02.991
And he told, he said, you know, I always hated being a tailor, but it was the only way in which he could make a living.

23:03.511 --> 23:09.997
When he finally retired, he went out to Los Angeles and found out above us and became our most active Zambler ever.

23:10.598 --> 23:15.803
And he also had an old car, an old Chevy Nova.

23:15.943 --> 23:26.814
He has an old Chevy Nova, and he would drive all over Santa Monica and Vifax and Venice, California.

23:26.834 --> 23:28.555
I'm just going to write him down before we get a Schaefer.

23:28.636 --> 23:30.638
Yeah, rounding up books from old Jews.

23:30.838 --> 23:32.740
And he made an arrangement.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.180
Come on in.

23:34.021 --> 23:44.133
He made an arrangement with the Workman's Circle, an old organization in L.A., to ship the books to us, and probably collected about 40,000 books in a while, and he's still alive.

23:44.153 --> 23:57.448
This is Nick Bashmaker, who's a writer who's writing a book about bibliomania, and he's writing about a lot of people who collect books in bibliomania, and Ferland Margamit runs our special conferences, but also runs the book collection.

23:57.468 --> 23:59.050
Sit down for one second.

23:59.317 --> 24:05.145
So, we had spoken once before, about two and a half years ago, and I had never mentioned... Let's take my tape.

24:05.165 --> 24:07.589
Why don't we just identify the woman who just walked in?

24:08.390 --> 24:08.951
Yeah.

24:08.971 --> 24:09.151
Go ahead.

24:09.171 --> 24:09.371
All right.

24:09.391 --> 24:15.019
My name is Pearl Ann Margalit, and I work with our volunteer... Could you spell it to me, Pearl Ann?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.142
...M-A-R-G-A-L-I-T.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.846
And Pearl Ann is... Pearl E-A-R-L.

24:20.027 --> 24:20.968
Yeah, I can understand.

24:20.988 --> 24:21.088
Okay.

24:21.338 --> 24:25.985
With all the six things.

24:26.005 --> 24:26.346
Okay.

24:26.366 --> 24:28.089
With a different accent, too.

24:28.109 --> 24:29.811
So it complicates life.

24:29.831 --> 24:30.352
Go ahead.

24:30.592 --> 24:35.280
I work with the volunteers who are known as sounders throughout the country.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.565
I'm actually going to give you a list here.

24:38.585 --> 24:40.047
I don't know if you want that.

24:40.107 --> 24:43.433
These are people who have officially signed up.

24:43.453 --> 24:46.958
Although we have a lot of people who collect books for our volunteers.

24:47.157 --> 24:49.279
in full verbatim as well.

24:49.520 --> 24:58.810
But these are the people who I know I can call upon at any given time, at any emergency, and I'll gladly help out.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.272
How long have you been working with Aaron?

25:01.453 --> 25:03.475
I think it's about five years.

25:03.495 --> 25:05.037
Yeah, I think so, yes.

25:05.057 --> 25:05.918
It doesn't seem that long.

25:05.938 --> 25:10.783
Do you share the passion, the energy that he so clearly projects?

25:10.803 --> 25:11.844
Oh, absolutely.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.568
Can't you see my face live part?

25:14.588 --> 25:16.810
Yeah, I really do.

25:17.110 --> 25:29.471
To me, in a sense, it was a little bit of a career change, although I was reared in a Yiddish-speaking household.

25:29.631 --> 25:31.634
You just anticipated my next question.

25:31.654 --> 25:34.579
Yeah, my parents are both Holocaust survivors.

25:34.964 --> 25:43.114
So after the war, they happened to move down to South Africa and continue to speak Yiddish.

25:43.154 --> 25:44.816
What accounts for the British accent?

25:44.916 --> 25:54.607
Well, South Africa, one of the former colonies, a quasi-British accent, not quite.

25:54.627 --> 25:56.550
And where were they survivors from?

25:56.590 --> 25:57.230
Which country?

25:57.311 --> 25:59.793
Well, from Poland and Lithuania.

26:00.234 --> 26:02.777
Both had very interesting little tales.

26:03.128 --> 26:28.933
I was very typical of people of my generation who really didn't quite feel comfortable about having parents who had a different accent and slightly different mannerisms and all that and it was really strange because I don't know if I've ever said that to you Erin but I had to leave home and go so far away to really truly appreciate

26:29.234 --> 26:32.838
everything that they had imparted to me.

26:32.858 --> 26:36.862
So, you know, that's why I kind of speak with an amazing passion.

26:36.882 --> 26:40.006
Are there phone numbers there for Jacob Schaefer and Sorrel?

26:40.026 --> 26:40.907
Yeah.

26:40.927 --> 26:42.368
Is Sorrel able to contact her?

26:42.388 --> 26:48.214
Sorrel, I spoke with her last week, and even her speech pattern has improved.

26:48.355 --> 26:49.696
I won't bother her if you don't.

26:49.716 --> 26:53.600
I mean, you pay tribute to her, which I think that's adequate.

26:54.101 --> 26:56.203
Jacob also is getting older now.

26:56.437 --> 27:00.601
I think that Morris Wilder is also a very special person.

27:00.641 --> 27:01.743
That's a good guy to talk about.

27:01.783 --> 27:02.664
He's American-born.

27:03.224 --> 27:06.868
But another one, he's collected inordinate numbers of books.

27:07.309 --> 27:08.530
He offers his own passion.

27:08.550 --> 27:16.679
You have to understand that as much as I'm passionate here about what we do, over the country, these people who are collecting books... Synergistic is the word.

27:16.699 --> 27:19.722
I mean, all the energy kind of... These people really care.

27:19.902 --> 27:21.243
People care about books.

27:21.304 --> 27:24.587
And, of course, the love of books goes very deep in Jewish culture.

27:24.871 --> 27:28.016
And it's more than just an incidental obsession.

27:28.076 --> 27:29.358
It was really the key to survival.

27:29.418 --> 27:31.581
No, I know about the Genesia idea.

27:31.601 --> 27:32.122
Yeah, Genesia, right.

27:32.142 --> 27:32.582
Genesia.

27:32.602 --> 27:35.146
And I've been actually, I'm trying to find some information.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.069
I understand they found one in Cairo.

27:37.469 --> 27:39.893
Yeah, it's a very famous Solomon.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.315
I think I have some stuff on that.

27:42.116 --> 27:42.296
Yeah.

27:42.717 --> 27:47.103
But someone wants to say, books are Jews' portable homeland for people without a country of our own.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.045
Say that a little slower.

27:48.065 --> 27:51.249
That books are the portable homeland of the Jewish people.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.713
Because the people without a country of our own

27:53.913 --> 27:58.761
our national identity resides in literary text, resides in the written word.

27:59.062 --> 28:05.754
And that, I think, is why the zombies who are out there have this almost in their, you know, it's bread in the bone.

28:05.954 --> 28:12.846
It is such a deep and profound part of one's consciousness.

28:12.866 --> 28:14.849
It's been essential to survival, I guess.

28:14.869 --> 28:15.190
Exactly.

28:15.230 --> 28:16.292
And we all know this.

28:16.532 --> 28:17.554
I could never as a kid.

28:17.574 --> 28:18.756
I mean, it's so funny, but just

28:19.208 --> 28:23.093
It's a kid, no matter what book we were reading, if we ever dropped a book, my parents would always have us pick it up.

28:23.554 --> 28:26.077
Even if it was a book that your father had anything, anything.

28:26.097 --> 28:26.678
During the 60s.

28:26.718 --> 28:27.579
That's right, that's right.

28:27.719 --> 28:28.981
Exactly, exactly.

28:29.001 --> 28:47.865
And I think most youth grew up with that kind of thing, and these authors therefore understand that there's a culture in danger, and they respond with such a... You mentioned that occasionally, and I was at a bar mitzvah a couple weeks ago, and I asked the rabbi about whether or not there are, in fact, any periodic funerals or books.

28:48.267 --> 28:51.713
He told me to get in touch with the Jewish, some council in Boston.

28:52.134 --> 28:53.316
The Jewish Book Council, maybe?

28:53.336 --> 28:54.338
Some council.

28:54.418 --> 28:56.121
I'd love to go to one of these things.

28:56.161 --> 28:57.083
Yeah, they have one.

28:57.324 --> 28:59.127
I'm just arranging out for another level.

28:59.147 --> 28:59.528
You are?

28:59.548 --> 28:59.968
I really am.

29:00.189 --> 29:01.772
Yeah, they just tell me about this.

29:01.792 --> 29:02.513
You're going to have one?

29:03.303 --> 29:06.106
We won't do it, but we'll turn the books over to someone who will then bury these books.

29:06.126 --> 29:07.087
Who would I talk to?

29:07.748 --> 29:09.650
I mean, I'd love to just go through one of these.

29:09.670 --> 29:10.831
It's just amazing for it now.

29:10.871 --> 29:14.195
You could speak to the person who's in charge of the warehouse, not a Jeffrey.

29:14.255 --> 29:15.396
I'm going down there from here.

29:15.416 --> 29:15.997
Oh, yeah.

29:16.077 --> 29:16.798
Ask Jeffrey about it.

29:16.938 --> 29:17.779
Jeffrey.

29:18.119 --> 29:19.020
Wouldn't that be interesting?

29:19.120 --> 29:19.420
Oh, yeah.

29:19.440 --> 29:19.961
I might want to.

29:19.981 --> 29:20.982
It's very, very interesting.

29:21.022 --> 29:21.823
Well, I mean, moving.

29:21.883 --> 29:23.545
I mean, to me, these things are life.

29:23.685 --> 29:27.189
One of my favorite titles of the book is Books Are Not Life, But Then What Is?

29:27.509 --> 29:30.092
And that's, you know, that's a book from 1970.

29:30.232 --> 29:31.133
Yeah.

29:31.619 --> 29:32.220
They are.

29:32.240 --> 29:32.500
Go ahead.

29:32.540 --> 29:38.129
The only difference in the funeral I went to is that instead of having people dig out the grave, they had a backbone there because it was so big.

29:38.529 --> 29:39.331
They had a what?

29:39.451 --> 29:40.693
A backbone to dig.

29:40.853 --> 29:41.634
Oh, really?

29:41.814 --> 29:49.606
The Rabbi said that occasionally what they will do is if there's, for some reason, if there's a funeral of an infant or a child that they might combine that with.

29:50.067 --> 29:50.427
Oh, really?

29:50.487 --> 29:51.489
Apparently they will.

29:51.609 --> 29:53.071
It's it, but I guess.

29:53.312 --> 29:56.356
It certainly shows that it may be acceptable.

29:56.436 --> 29:57.438
Yeah, it does.

29:57.959 --> 29:58.600
I'm sorry.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.142
I'm sorry.

30:00.783 --> 30:00.883
Okay.

30:01.252 --> 30:03.114
What do you want to know about the Wilbur?

30:03.134 --> 30:03.375
Let's start.

30:05.778 --> 30:05.998
Go ahead.

30:06.038 --> 30:06.979
Where are they from, the Wilbur?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.582
They are both, I think they're both New Yorkers.

30:09.602 --> 30:09.843
Oh, great.

30:10.223 --> 30:24.441
And besides being very involved with, you know, the Yiddish Book Center, they also are very keen photographers, and they're very involved with the bridge building project in the New York school system.

30:24.944 --> 30:31.993
And another one of their passions was being informing people about the Chinese culture.

30:32.013 --> 30:34.896
So they have... But they really love cultures.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.760
They have a small house, I don't know, Brooklyn somewhere.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.762
They collect as well for themselves?

30:39.842 --> 30:40.363
Yeah.

30:40.643 --> 30:41.845
No, no.

30:42.265 --> 30:46.871
So the satisfaction of collecting... You have to kind of go and see to just appreciate the setup there.

30:47.492 --> 30:50.375
Small, you know, modest, you know, in a class house in Brooklyn somewhere.

30:50.856 --> 30:52.538
There's a back alley with a garage there.

30:53.750 --> 30:54.731
Fill it up with books.

30:54.912 --> 31:00.159
Every time we go to New York, which is maybe every month, every two months now, you know, we have books to pick up from them.

31:00.179 --> 31:01.500
And I don't know how they do it exactly.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.121
They're not young.

31:02.161 --> 31:08.089
Well, they're both in their late 70s, and they're extraordinary in terms of their commitment and dedication.

31:08.109 --> 31:11.914
You know, they get out there on snowy, icy days.

31:12.094 --> 31:14.718
They have great good humor is why I think you'd enjoy them, though.

31:15.078 --> 31:15.719
And these are different.

31:15.739 --> 31:19.164
These are not Europeans who are kind of saving their own culture exactly.

31:19.184 --> 31:21.647
These are people who were born here who really still have that connection.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.390
Are there numbers there also?

31:23.410 --> 31:24.712
Yes, there are numbers.

31:24.792 --> 31:26.454
Oh, that's wonderful.

31:26.474 --> 31:28.276
Mars and Sarah Wildor.

31:28.296 --> 31:30.179
Mars, that's M-A-U-R.

31:30.199 --> 31:32.242
M-O-R-R-I-S.

31:32.262 --> 31:32.983
Mars and Sarah.

31:33.163 --> 31:33.964
Sarah Wildor.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.346
Two L's, one L's.

31:36.527 --> 31:37.168
Two L's.

31:38.210 --> 31:39.591
The number is 718-251-3855.

31:39.611 --> 31:39.792
Good.

31:40.873 --> 31:51.207
Not only would they like to talk to you, you'll get a good meal out of it, too.

31:51.227 --> 31:51.347
Great.

31:53.420 --> 31:58.226
I just want to get this to you.

31:59.127 --> 32:06.275
We need to update it because we've moved, but all the information is reasonably up to date, and I'm sure you'll find it very well.

32:06.656 --> 32:07.497
Thank you so much.

32:07.637 --> 32:14.485
Just for sure, it's funny because this I designed, this is a fact before we gave it to four designers, and I did this myself, and this was done like in 1980.

32:14.605 --> 32:18.370
I think it's very pretty for me.

32:18.390 --> 32:20.312
Well, I wish you best of luck.

32:20.332 --> 32:21.754
Thanks so much.

32:21.774 --> 32:22.735
Very serious.

32:23.086 --> 32:27.673
I have one bit of news that's relevant to what I'll just tell you.

32:27.934 --> 32:34.725
I just came back and started at a summer camp in Pennsylvania where there are leaders of these beneath-birth youth organizations from around the country.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.668
These are kids 16 and 17 years old.

32:37.369 --> 32:44.260
And this year, more than ever before, used the enthusiastic response of these kids.

32:44.761 --> 32:50.190
And what they agreed to do is they are now going to organize these youth chapters as collectors around the country.

32:50.356 --> 32:54.139
and organized collection drives in about a half dozen major cities.

32:54.159 --> 32:57.642
So now, not only do we have all the books collecting, we'll have these kids collecting for us as well.

32:57.662 --> 32:58.563
It's very exciting.

32:58.583 --> 32:59.724
It's a brand new development.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.045
That's it.

33:01.065 --> 33:07.031
So we'll get all that information nicely from you, Aaron.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.312
Thanks, Sophia.

33:08.412 --> 33:10.834
You know what we do for people who collect this packet.

33:11.635 --> 33:16.479
Some are more active than others.

33:16.499 --> 33:17.860
Some are very, very active.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.042
Well, again, the focus is on

33:20.326 --> 33:26.018
I know you put them in these posters and they put these up on your telephone poles and Jewish delicatessens and that kind of thing.

33:26.278 --> 33:31.268
When you originally started this, you thought maybe a two-year commitment.

33:31.288 --> 33:32.411
Now it's your life, right?

33:32.431 --> 33:34.234
Yeah, absolutely.

33:34.254 --> 33:41.389
And one of the things that you had said last time, and I noticed, you said your mother wonders when she loves, she's so proud of what you're doing.

33:41.707 --> 33:44.009
But when are you going to find yourself a good Jewish wife?

33:44.230 --> 33:47.173
Oh, since I spoke to you last, I am not only married, but we have a baby now.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.974
Congratulations.

33:49.155 --> 33:55.701
I noticed the ring there, and I said, it's wonderful.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.004
Congratulations.

33:59.024 --> 33:59.805
Thank you very much.

33:59.845 --> 34:00.726
That's wonderful.

34:00.746 --> 34:01.087
Your name?

34:01.647 --> 34:02.408
Sarah Rysel.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.271
Ah, I have two great mother-in-law.

34:05.671 --> 34:05.951
Great.

34:07.233 --> 34:09.955
So anyway, how do you spell the middle name?

34:09.976 --> 34:10.256
R-A-Y-Z-L.

34:10.636 --> 34:10.756
Okay.

34:11.117 --> 34:11.477
Sarah Rysel.

34:11.677 --> 34:12.539
Great.

34:13.641 --> 34:16.607
Hadn't slowed down the intensity for the project.

34:17.289 --> 34:17.990
Having gotten married?

34:18.672 --> 34:20.115
No, I just had my wife to help me now.

34:20.816 --> 34:22.981
Actually, not in the least.

34:23.321 --> 34:24.363
What's your wife's name?

34:24.864 --> 34:25.806
Gail.

34:28.452 --> 34:29.955
It's very interesting because

34:30.340 --> 34:35.367
I probably told you when you were here, whatever that was, two years ago, that things would eventually slow down in collecting books.

34:35.748 --> 34:36.549
It hasn't happened yet.

34:36.589 --> 34:37.871
It's getting embarrassing.

34:37.891 --> 34:42.697
I get up every year at our annual board meeting and I say, well, I think that book collection has now slowed down.

34:43.378 --> 34:48.265
And it's still, it's a consistent 50,000 books a year coming in right now, no matter what we do.

34:48.285 --> 34:49.046
And what's going up?

34:50.208 --> 34:51.369
The number's increasing.

34:52.611 --> 34:55.515
It's getting upwards of 10,000 maybe going out now.

34:55.535 --> 34:58.980
So this is still, you're still gathering and preserving this.

34:59.450 --> 35:01.032
We just had a conversation this morning.

35:01.052 --> 35:02.555
It's not in and out, in other words.

35:02.575 --> 35:04.037
Not yet.

35:04.057 --> 35:05.299
But it eventually will.

35:05.339 --> 35:08.944
I mean, the number of books we send out has been doubling every year.

35:08.964 --> 35:13.972
It's still a repository as much as... Yes, but ultimately a clearinghouse as well.

35:14.092 --> 35:18.418
I say the number of books going out has doubled every year in the past five years, which is very significant.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.662
And still all to institutions?

35:20.942 --> 35:24.768
No, to individuals as well, if we have enough duplicate copies of the books.

35:24.968 --> 35:27.752
Is your policy still absolute that you will not buy a book?

35:28.205 --> 35:28.586
Yeah.

35:28.606 --> 35:29.848
We don't like books.

35:30.028 --> 35:30.629
That's important.

35:30.689 --> 35:31.651
Yeah.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.432
Oh, yeah.

35:33.033 --> 35:34.796
We've never found the need to be doing that.

35:34.816 --> 35:36.719
But, I mean, it's quality, too, I think.

35:36.739 --> 35:37.160
That's right.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.742
Except with new books, of course.

35:38.863 --> 35:39.864
Of course.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.787
But never used books.

35:42.028 --> 35:42.148
Okay.

35:42.368 --> 35:50.702
So, Ash, you told me the last time that every month you duel with bankruptcy so often that it's almost

35:51.121 --> 35:52.843
they revere a part of life.

35:53.004 --> 35:54.706
Is it still a shoestring?

35:54.726 --> 35:58.471
It's a million-dollar budget, but it's still a shoestring, a million-dollar budget.

35:58.831 --> 36:00.514
It's a big struggle even now.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.837
Our membership continues to grow.

36:03.197 --> 36:05.460
The number of libraries have established growth.

36:05.480 --> 36:10.327
The other part is that, since I spoke to you, we've increased the educational work dramatically now.

36:11.508 --> 36:13.611
We've always recognized there are three phases to the work.

36:13.691 --> 36:14.713
One was collecting books.

36:15.334 --> 36:17.436
Second, distributing them, getting them back into use.

36:17.957 --> 36:20.841
But the third, in effect, is letting the world know what's inside these books.

36:21.158 --> 36:23.760
I probably told you we'd started these summer programs years ago.

36:24.241 --> 36:27.704
We're expanding all of that now in a lot of dramatic ways.

36:28.164 --> 36:36.031
Starting this winter, we'll be running a week-long program for college students, and we now have a vastly expanded summer internship program.

36:36.331 --> 36:37.532
Have you been getting our publications?

36:37.732 --> 36:41.035
I haven't, and I would like to be on your mailing list.

36:41.436 --> 36:45.479
The next issue of our magazine is just coming up, but I'll give you the last issue, which we did.

36:45.499 --> 36:46.400
They sent me that one.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.000
I asked for it.

36:47.101 --> 36:51.064
That was one up in Nova Scotia where they planned all these new events up there.

36:51.297 --> 36:55.084
So we're doing a lot of work, but I'd like to be at a... This is another reason why I'm here.

36:55.145 --> 36:59.373
It could be brought up to date, but I... Put you on right now.

36:59.393 --> 37:03.561
Once my book is out and there's a little income, you know, maybe I can... Who knows?

37:03.581 --> 37:06.507
Have you ever heard of a guy named Toby Holtzman in Michigan, by the way?

37:08.190 --> 37:09.693
All right, that's okay.

37:09.773 --> 37:12.158
I've dropped your name around to people who might be able to help.

37:12.863 --> 37:13.925
Michael Zinman.

37:13.945 --> 37:14.546
Do you know Michael?

37:14.606 --> 37:14.827
No.

37:14.887 --> 37:17.030
I should have felt it.

37:17.051 --> 37:18.573
Anyone you can put in touch with, though, we will get.

37:18.593 --> 37:28.611
I should just say, the last thing we're doing in terms of books now is I just the other day had a conversation, and we are about to branch out energetically into South America now.

37:28.731 --> 37:29.433
Energetically.

37:30.515 --> 37:31.897
Energetically, yes.

37:31.937 --> 37:36.846
We've been collecting books in a very limited way in Argentina.

37:37.062 --> 37:38.043
And I'm not sure when.

37:38.063 --> 37:39.565
It's probably since I spoke to you last.

37:39.586 --> 37:41.328
We had a huge find down there.

37:41.348 --> 37:42.630
There's a... In Argentina.

37:42.810 --> 37:46.595
Yeah, there's a man named Mark Swiatlo who has been collecting books.

37:46.615 --> 37:49.419
A Polish Jew who had lived in Argentina and now lives in Florida.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.044
And he's been collecting books from Florida Atlantic University.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.847
And he's been working with us as well.

37:55.548 --> 37:58.332
And he went down there and he found... There was a series of books.

37:58.352 --> 38:01.997
We have a whole article about this that you can read in one of our back issues.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.420
There was a series of books...

38:05.058 --> 38:10.065
It was published in Argentina right after the war.

38:10.225 --> 38:11.687
It was 175 titles.

38:12.428 --> 38:21.520
Many of them were Holocaust survivors, memoirs of survivors of the Holocaust, but others were cultural and historical studies of communities in Eastern Europe, some literary works as well.

38:22.201 --> 38:25.525
These books have been out of print for years and years, and everyone thought they were unavailable.

38:26.126 --> 38:30.812
And this guy went down and found 3,000 unsold copies of these books in October.

38:31.231 --> 38:37.542
some kind of warehouse garage or something of Buenos Aires, and he managed to get them out of there and ship them up here, and so we now have those as well.

38:38.824 --> 38:48.961
But we think there are several hundred thousand books in Buenos Aires alone, and many more books in Brazil and in Uruguay and in Mexico, and even some in Costa Rica.

38:49.021 --> 38:49.903
I had to get them here.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.868
Yeah, so we're starting a major expedition in...

38:53.337 --> 38:58.985
In January, right after we finish our winter program for college students, my wife and I and the new baby will fly down.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.427
Yeah, we'll fly down.

39:00.447 --> 39:01.589
She's already well-traveled.

39:01.609 --> 39:04.433
We're going to fly down to Costa Rica.

39:05.174 --> 39:17.472
And with the help of a woman there, who's the head of the Jewish day school in Costa Rica, who's a native Yiddish speaker and Spanish speaker, we'll then go from there on to Argentina.

39:17.873 --> 39:23.923
where we'll begin organizing a whole collection operation down there, in a sense replicating what we've done here and arranging for shipments.

39:24.123 --> 39:24.644
So exciting.

39:24.985 --> 39:27.849
Yeah, and we now have a group in South Africa working with doing collections.

39:27.869 --> 39:30.173
You said your life course is set, isn't it?

39:30.273 --> 39:31.175
There's plenty of work to do.

39:31.235 --> 39:38.006
I think that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, I'll be spending a lot less time rescuing books.

39:38.026 --> 39:41.572
But I'll have, in a sense, even more work to do at that point.

39:41.592 --> 39:42.754
How old are you now?

39:42.774 --> 39:43.375
I'm now 37.

39:43.928 --> 39:47.952
One project we've begun is to try to reprint works of Yiddish literature.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.934
There are many titles of which we already don't know.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.356
And the result of that is the same thing.

39:51.416 --> 39:51.696
Really?

39:51.716 --> 39:56.160
Yes, Messjith historical society continues to publish things, which we've started.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.282
That's great.

39:57.302 --> 40:00.124
The Adams Family Project is one of their things, you know.

40:00.144 --> 40:02.827
But he started that 200 years ago.

40:02.847 --> 40:05.089
So what we'll do is we will... That's great.

40:05.109 --> 40:08.052
We're going to do more than just reprinting.

40:08.072 --> 40:12.877
The easier thing would be to just photograph the books that do facsimile reproduction and offset.

40:12.897 --> 40:13.598
But that's not...

40:14.202 --> 40:20.467
good enough, because what's needed is that we have to reset the books in modern orthography so the students can read them readily.

40:20.768 --> 40:23.730
Yiddish spelling wasn't standardized until yesterday.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.312
Very, very recently.

40:26.233 --> 40:35.080
Standardized the spelling, but even more importantly than that, in any given Yiddish book, between 15 and 20 percent of the words do not appear in any published Yiddish dictionary.

40:35.881 --> 40:42.707
These are words that come from Ukrainian and Russian and other languages, or they are difficult concepts that you just cannot find in the dictionary.

40:43.227 --> 40:45.170
So we have this big project, and we're beginning.

40:45.210 --> 40:48.456
That's why I was excited about this meeting that's about to come this afternoon.

40:49.217 --> 40:56.989
What we'll do is develop a database of all the words, including all the inflected forms of all the words that appear in the two major published Yiddish dictionaries.

40:57.751 --> 41:07.466
And then we will start entering entire Yiddish novels into the computer, and then run them against the database, and then automatically identify all the words in the given text that aren't in the dictionary.

41:07.486 --> 41:08.849
Do you have a mainframe?

41:08.869 --> 41:09.690
No, it's solved on a...

41:09.788 --> 41:12.152
We have a Vax, but this will be done on PCs.

41:13.073 --> 41:28.796
And then we will identify the words that aren't in the dictionary, and then work with older Jews who are still around and scholars to help us identify these, not only words, but also phrases and just cultural oddities, things that are no longer recognizable to the modern reader.

41:29.297 --> 41:38.631
And what we will do is end up producing fully annotated editions of Yiddish literature, where at the bottom of each page of Yiddish text will be English language footnotes, translating words and explaining.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.904
those culturally specific things that wouldn't be recognizable to future readers.

41:43.385 --> 41:54.637
In doing that, we feel it will lay an infrastructure whereby students 50 or 100 years from now, long after the native Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe were gone, the students will still have access to the literature.

41:54.677 --> 41:55.899
So that's another big project.

41:56.299 --> 42:03.888
And the biggest project of all that I think will take certainly the rest of my life is really letting the world know why this literature is important.

42:04.388 --> 42:08.753
I mean, as I see Yiddish literature, I think it's critical in the scheme of Jewish history

42:09.087 --> 42:11.750
because it's a bridge literature.

42:11.770 --> 42:14.153
It's a bridge between two epochs of Jewish history.

42:14.894 --> 42:17.957
You have, I mean, if you saw kind of one great epoch... E-P-O-C-H.

42:17.977 --> 42:18.277
Right.

42:18.738 --> 42:34.015
If you saw one great epoch of Jewish history, which began, you know, which existed at the time when Jews were living in their own country in Israel, and then ends in 135, or in 70, when the temple was destroyed, and 135 after the defeat of Bar Kokhba by the Romans,

42:34.501 --> 42:38.246
At that point, that was when Jews, you know, the diaspora kind of officially begins.

42:38.266 --> 42:41.250
Jews really start spreading out in much larger numbers than before.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.733
And they have to reconstitute Jewishness.

42:43.793 --> 42:47.278
How do you have a Jewish identity which exists without a territorial base?

42:47.838 --> 42:51.102
And that's where the Talmud is written over a period of several hundred years.

42:51.503 --> 42:52.865
And the Talmud becomes a bridge.

42:52.905 --> 42:58.512
It codifies the knowledge that it had existed before that point and lays the foundation for Jewish life in the New World.

42:59.073 --> 43:01.216
That world prevails for 1,800 years.

43:01.616 --> 43:03.158
The late 19th century comes.

43:03.408 --> 43:11.218
the challenge of rationalism and industrialization happens, takes place, and then it's lecture all the time.

43:12.220 --> 43:15.744
So then Jews have to then figure out how to live in the modern world.

43:15.944 --> 43:21.752
Yiddish becomes the language again in which they remember the immediate past, lay the foundation for the future.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.716
It doesn't matter that it won't continue.

43:24.736 --> 43:27.239
It doesn't matter that Jews have now moved on to other languages.

43:27.299 --> 43:30.023
The fact is that that first moment of transition

43:30.391 --> 43:36.539
But now we get to the early stage of what's called the Mishnah, or the early part of the Talmud, takes place in Yiddish.

43:36.599 --> 43:41.285
And Yiddish literature is therefore a critical bridge between two worlds, between two epochs.

43:41.765 --> 43:43.688
And for that reason, we have to contend with it.

43:44.449 --> 43:56.624
If Jews today, the American Jewish community, if we're going to know what it means to live as Jews in the modern world, we can't ignore the very first body of literature in which Jews confronted the modern world.

43:56.784 --> 43:59.267
All of that becomes absolutely critical.

43:59.669 --> 44:04.155
When you started, you were told, why waste your time in a dead language?

44:04.175 --> 44:04.956
Right.

44:05.016 --> 44:08.081
That's 10 or 12 years or so ago.

44:08.101 --> 44:08.201
Yeah.

44:08.221 --> 44:08.942
How do you feel now?

44:09.583 --> 44:12.006
I don't hear that very much anymore.

44:12.167 --> 44:16.252
Is the battle being, I hate to use that as a metaphor, but... Yes, the battle is being won.

44:16.272 --> 44:18.856
I think consciousness is being raised.

44:18.876 --> 44:28.950
I think that gradually, well, even five years ago, when I would go to major universities and try to speak with librarians about why they should have Yiddish books,

44:29.200 --> 44:31.604
I was still greeted with a certain measure of skepticism.

44:32.285 --> 44:41.459
I think partly as a result of the Newman collection, the collection we set up at Yale, but also partly as a result of just a greater understanding of what history means.

44:41.479 --> 44:46.888
I mean, historiography generally has changed more and more towards social history.

44:47.609 --> 44:56.102
And when you look at social history of Jews, so you look at Jews as a people, you can't help but look at Yiddish, the language that 80% of them were speaking for the last thousand years.

44:56.521 --> 45:00.387
And therefore, when I go to university libraries today, people understand that.

45:01.288 --> 45:03.952
Yes, we know that Yiddish books belong in libraries.

45:03.992 --> 45:05.774
How can you help us to get those collections?

45:06.375 --> 45:14.146
And even when I speak to the same people in the Jewish establishment who had kind of dismissed this work or denigrated this work 12 years ago, even there, there's more resonance.

45:14.186 --> 45:21.396
The fact that we have a thriving organization with 13,000 members is already proof that Jews care, that this is important.

45:21.917 --> 45:24.621
And it's funny, the greatest resonance sometimes comes from young people.

45:25.023 --> 45:28.606
who don't know enough to be prejudiced against this, who just take it at face value.

45:28.626 --> 45:30.948
Which is really the target audience.

45:31.149 --> 45:31.529
Of course.

45:31.549 --> 45:35.052
Ultimately, that is the future, and that's what we have to address ourselves to.

45:35.072 --> 45:36.353
So that's very exciting.

45:36.373 --> 45:41.158
So I guess the answer is, I don't hear the challenge that Yiddish is dead so much anymore.

45:41.178 --> 45:42.859
I mean, I think people are beginning to learn.

45:43.019 --> 45:44.761
Our work has been successful in any way.

45:45.461 --> 45:47.003
It's helped to change that consciousness.

45:47.743 --> 45:52.768
I mean, I think I've probably told you this before, even the books themselves were such a powerful metaphor.

45:53.035 --> 45:56.202
You know, it's one thing to let a culture kind of fall into disuse.

45:56.864 --> 46:06.666
It's a very different thing to have to be faced with that, to really see it before your eyes and to understand that someone says to you, look, it's not only that we're losing Yiddish culture, we're literally throwing it away.

46:06.987 --> 46:12.259
At this very moment, there were 8,000 books sitting in a garbage dumpster about to be thrown out unless we do something about it.

46:12.543 --> 46:17.710
I think that helps to shock people into wakefulness and let them realize that something has to be done.

46:17.730 --> 46:22.036
It's like looking at the deteriorating marvel at the Aquapolis.

46:22.296 --> 46:23.658
We've got to do something.

46:23.678 --> 46:26.502
I'm using my Greek background now.

46:26.542 --> 46:28.104
That's right.

46:28.364 --> 46:29.586
Somebody has to do something.

46:29.626 --> 46:33.491
Do you still go into the annex at night by yourself?

46:33.791 --> 46:36.475
Not that the images...

46:36.708 --> 46:38.230
I may even start with that.

46:38.250 --> 46:40.092
I don't know if it's different.

46:40.472 --> 46:47.660
Because with everything that's happening in your life, you're doing 200 miles an hour, sometimes you go in and you have to say, my God.

46:47.741 --> 46:49.022
Yeah, it's still happening.

46:49.202 --> 46:51.164
Yeah, I don't go in there in search of religious experience.

46:51.184 --> 46:54.268
I go in there because a lot of people have gone off rough pigeon inside office.

46:54.288 --> 46:55.249
But absolutely.

46:55.269 --> 46:56.410
It happens regularly.

46:56.751 --> 46:57.592
Now even more so.

46:57.612 --> 47:04.960
I think as I get older, as I've had a child, my perceptions of all this perhaps deepen, if anything.

47:05.277 --> 47:14.008
So rather than becoming inured to the sight of a million books and taking it for granted, just the opposite has to come to appreciate it more and more, really, what's here.

47:14.569 --> 47:19.915
Also, as the last of the older generation passed on, the books become all that more precious to me.

47:19.935 --> 47:28.566
I understand more and more how they're really... No, I understand more and more how they're really... They are the repository of that world.

47:28.626 --> 47:31.470
Whatever we'll live of Jewish life in the past thousand years,

47:31.754 --> 47:32.875
will live in those books.

47:32.895 --> 47:34.377
How old is your child?

47:34.417 --> 47:35.719
She's now nine months old.

47:35.739 --> 47:39.544
Nine months, so she was born in October of 1991.

47:40.345 --> 47:40.906
October what?

47:41.347 --> 47:42.288
October 14, 1991.

47:43.229 --> 47:43.469
Great.

47:43.509 --> 47:45.552
Yeah, it changes everything.

47:45.572 --> 47:50.939
Validates your life in a way that you... It validates my life and also validates what I do with my life.

47:52.341 --> 47:56.927
It reminds me all the more for whom I am saving these books.

47:57.167 --> 47:59.070
So I think it's become very important.

47:59.090 --> 48:00.732
Did you meet your wife in context with

48:00.948 --> 48:04.737
We were fixed up on a blind date by one of my professors.

48:05.179 --> 48:10.352
And one other thing before the tape runs out on this plane, tell me a little bit of how we got here.

48:10.412 --> 48:12.216
We're no longer in a brick place.

48:12.577 --> 48:16.527
Our wonderful brick schoolhouse

48:17.283 --> 48:21.130
was leased to us at a very minimal rent by the town of Amherst for 11 years.

48:21.490 --> 48:21.931
Wonderful.

48:22.512 --> 48:28.663
And the school population of Amherst is a thriving academic community, and the school population has been increasing dramatically.

48:28.683 --> 48:32.510
And this year they had no choice but to take back the building to open it up as a school again.

48:33.231 --> 48:36.256
This year being for the fall of... The fall of 1991.

48:36.757 --> 48:37.358
Fall of 92.

48:37.459 --> 48:38.200
Oh, upcoming.

48:38.220 --> 48:38.781
Yeah, okay.

48:39.282 --> 48:41.686
So last... So you just moved on here, then?

48:41.706 --> 48:42.227
Three weeks ago.

48:42.848 --> 48:44.110
You've only been in here three weeks?

48:44.210 --> 48:46.814
Yeah, and we ran a summer program for 150 people in the midst of it.

48:46.854 --> 48:47.315
Wow.

48:50.580 --> 48:52.283
There's more than three weeks now, sorry.

48:52.303 --> 48:52.984
Well, I'm fine.

48:54.025 --> 48:54.746
June 10th morning.

48:54.947 --> 48:55.788
June 10th morning.

48:56.669 --> 48:57.050
Okay.

48:57.931 --> 48:59.193
Time moves so quickly right now.

48:59.374 --> 49:00.696
So, go ahead.

49:00.716 --> 49:02.679
Anyway, you got kicked out of that building, basically.

49:02.699 --> 49:03.480
We had to leave.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.002
We were frantically searched about.

49:05.323 --> 49:06.224
Told you had to leave.

49:06.284 --> 49:06.605
Yes.

49:07.346 --> 49:07.807
Yes, right.

49:07.867 --> 49:08.928
There's a more gentle way.

49:08.968 --> 49:10.611
Yes, I will accept your wording on that.

49:11.215 --> 49:13.298
They might take umbrage at that.

49:13.318 --> 49:13.899
No, no, we weren't.

49:14.139 --> 49:21.149
Actually, the truth is, the town was very gracious about all of this, and they really could not have been more accommodating, and we couldn't be more appreciative of that.

49:21.169 --> 49:23.672
But they needed the building back, and we had to leave the building.

49:24.613 --> 49:31.363
Eventually, the president of Hampshire College, a man named Gregory Prince, found a temporary building for us near his campus.

49:31.403 --> 49:38.713
It was an old, it's not old, it was a metal building, a little butler building, that had been used as the sales office for a condominium complex.

49:39.514 --> 49:40.395
And...

49:40.932 --> 49:48.759
they were going to give the building to the college, the condominium complex retirement village, was going to donate the building to the college for our use.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.320
And we were going to move in.

49:50.340 --> 49:51.261
It didn't even have windows.

49:51.301 --> 49:52.462
We'd have to cut windows into it.

49:52.482 --> 49:53.883
We were getting ready to do all of this.

49:54.003 --> 49:54.784
We were about to move.

49:54.804 --> 49:55.485
This was in May.

49:56.145 --> 49:59.929
And it turned out that the land the building was on was not owned by the retirement village.

49:59.949 --> 50:01.850
It was owned by another condominium complex.

50:02.190 --> 50:04.012
And they decided they didn't want us there.

50:04.032 --> 50:04.573
So here we are.

50:04.593 --> 50:06.294
We had like two weeks to get out of this building.

50:06.314 --> 50:07.335
We had no place to go.

50:07.875 --> 50:09.397
And we couldn't afford commercial rents.

50:09.437 --> 50:10.838
We really did know what to do.

50:11.240 --> 50:16.047
and we phoned Mount Holyoke College, who had been very helpful to us over the years.

50:16.067 --> 50:21.475
And Mount Holyoke said, well, as a matter of fact, they had been bequeathed this mansion.

50:21.495 --> 50:31.048
This is a 20-room mansion that had belonged to Joseph Skinner, who was a major industrial magnate of Holyoke, silk mills and satin mills of Holyoke.

50:31.209 --> 50:38.479
Skinner died in 1947 and left this building to the college with the understanding that his daughter could live here for as long as she lived.

50:38.999 --> 50:42.144
She died at the age of 90-something just a few years ago.

50:42.765 --> 50:48.133
The college has had the mansion, hasn't quite known what they wanted to do with it, and they agreed to rent this to us for a dollar a year.

50:48.493 --> 50:48.874
For how long?

50:49.154 --> 50:50.496
For at least the next three years.

50:51.217 --> 50:53.561
Would it be nice to keep the fit like you stayed here?

50:53.821 --> 50:57.247
Actually, we have even more ambitious long-term plans.

50:57.867 --> 51:04.197
The last development since we last spoke is we are going to be building a building of our own in which we will consolidate our entire operations.

51:04.700 --> 51:08.286
Most likely it will be on or adjacent to the campus of Hampshire College.

51:08.366 --> 51:13.053
I read someplace that Hampshire has actually had some kind of affiliation.

51:13.073 --> 51:15.537
Yeah, and we're negotiating, because I'm a Hampshire alum.

51:15.737 --> 51:15.937
Right.

51:16.398 --> 51:18.621
We're negotiating the specifics of this right now.

51:19.082 --> 51:26.834
But what it looks like will happen is the Book Center will end up owning somewhere 10 acres of land, either on that campus or on another campus, most likely in Hampshire.

51:26.854 --> 51:29.458
And we'll build there not only our offices,

51:29.827 --> 51:33.192
We'll also build a building for a large part of the book collection.

51:33.212 --> 51:34.534
We can't afford to build for all of them.

51:34.554 --> 51:36.918
But we'll give you an academic affiliation.

51:37.038 --> 51:38.080
Which is great.

51:38.601 --> 51:41.565
And the other part is that Hampshire will then want us to build a conference center.

51:42.166 --> 51:47.334
And we will build an educational center with classrooms and an auditorium so that we can run conferences all year round.

51:47.354 --> 51:54.546
Where all year we can be bringing people to the books where they can come and explore Yiddish culture in various ways.

51:54.646 --> 51:55.507
Lecture centers.

51:55.647 --> 51:56.709
I'm so excited about it.

51:56.729 --> 51:57.891
Yeah, we're really proud.

51:57.911 --> 51:58.011
Yeah.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.203
And also we'll have programs for kids as well.

52:00.223 --> 52:03.068
And the other part of it, there will be a big exhibit hall.

52:03.088 --> 52:12.725
We'll develop our realm, not quite a museum, that's too static a word, but an exhibit center, which will exhibit not only the books, but the culture they represent in very lively, dynamic, interactive ways.

52:12.745 --> 52:16.070
You still have the only linoclite machine, is that down there?

52:16.090 --> 52:18.434
I'm going to take some pictures when I get out of here.

52:18.535 --> 52:20.718
Did you see the article on the Wall Street Journal about that?

52:21.219 --> 52:21.439
No.

52:21.700 --> 52:22.421
Okay, I'll give you a clip.

52:22.441 --> 52:23.543
Okay, I'll see.

52:24.215 --> 52:30.885
It's very funny, the Wall Street Journal picked up on this story a year later and ran an article in which they actually ran the headline of the story.

52:30.905 --> 52:31.866
Oh, nice.

52:32.006 --> 52:34.831
So it's the first time ever in the history of the Wall Street Journal.

52:35.872 --> 52:37.675
So you'll see that as well.

52:37.935 --> 52:40.158
Jocelyn's going to... I don't want to take up too much of your time.

52:40.178 --> 52:42.722
This is more than I ever expected to get.

52:43.023 --> 52:45.707
But I would like to... You want the quote of this?

52:45.727 --> 52:46.187
Yes, man.

52:46.207 --> 52:48.391
And the title page also.

52:48.411 --> 52:48.711
Yeah.

52:48.731 --> 52:50.053
But share this finger at the...

52:50.405 --> 52:58.934
a number of significant challenges for the historian or literary critic because he writes originally in Yiddish but translates immediately into English.

52:59.314 --> 53:00.716
He does the translation himself?

53:00.756 --> 53:02.237
He works with translators to do it.

53:02.257 --> 53:03.919
We should make it past tense, of course.

53:03.959 --> 53:05.901
Yeah, works with translators to do it.

53:06.302 --> 53:09.645
And the result was that he tended to polish the English version more than the Yiddish.

53:09.685 --> 53:12.288
The Yiddish was the original, so it becomes very difficult to learn.

53:12.588 --> 53:15.752
So we know what version to work with when you're studying.

53:15.892 --> 53:19.095
So many writers who I've interviewed over the years, I'm related to this book,

53:19.430 --> 53:25.956
will tell you they do not feel, even if they're conversant in the language, that somebody else should translate it.

53:27.497 --> 53:30.319
Because the temptation then is to create another work.

53:30.820 --> 53:31.901
That's very interesting.

53:31.961 --> 53:33.102
That's very interesting.

53:33.122 --> 53:37.806
And, you know, I'm surprised how the artist, the Greek guy, you know, he writes in English now.

53:37.866 --> 53:41.829
He's forced himself to write in English, but he doesn't want to translate it back to his native language.

53:42.330 --> 53:43.711
Because he says, I'm fooling around.

53:43.731 --> 53:44.792
I'm changing the writing.

53:44.812 --> 53:47.094
You know, then it becomes a different work.

53:47.434 --> 53:48.255
What did Maverick?

53:48.910 --> 53:51.613
He's the honorary chairperson of our board of directors.

53:52.113 --> 53:55.137
And Bela continues to be, Saul Bela continues to be?

53:55.157 --> 53:55.637
Bela's a friend.

53:56.098 --> 53:56.438
A friend.

53:56.658 --> 53:57.619
Yeah.

53:57.639 --> 54:01.203
Would he be interested in what Mike's trying to contact, do you think?

54:01.363 --> 54:02.945
I don't think he knows enough about our work.

54:02.965 --> 54:06.529
I've had dinner with him, but I don't think he knows enough about our work to be able to speak about it.

54:07.089 --> 54:09.192
You know, he's just more an admirer from afar.

54:09.212 --> 54:09.932
He hasn't been integral.

54:09.952 --> 54:11.294
But he might give a great quote, though.

54:11.314 --> 54:12.055
It might be useful.

54:12.075 --> 54:13.796
He'd give a great quote about his literature.

54:13.816 --> 54:14.537
Yeah, you could try that.

54:14.657 --> 54:15.358
And what you're doing.

54:15.698 --> 54:17.961
Yeah, he's living in Vermont now.

54:17.981 --> 54:18.141
I think.

54:18.593 --> 54:25.667
I don't want to steal, take away from what focus of the article, the essay is going to be.
