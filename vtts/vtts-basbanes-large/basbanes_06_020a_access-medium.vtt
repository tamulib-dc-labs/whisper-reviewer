12:45.447 --> 12:46.749
$775,000.

12:46.769 --> 12:48.030
$700,000.

Coming up on lot 180 after this one, this is 179 now.

13:59.578 --> 14:09.117
I have this on because the estimate on this 180 is 200 to 300 and if any lot at all has a chance to go under a thousand dollars, this is the one.

14:09.434 --> 14:33.045
Lock number 180 is next.
