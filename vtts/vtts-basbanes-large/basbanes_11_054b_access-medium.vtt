00:02.512 --> 00:18.340
Okay, one day we said in this catalog was the description of a small incunable of a religious text which caught my eye.

00:19.021 --> 00:25.212
As every antiquarian bookseller knows, religious texts, even the 15th century edition, are

00:25.613 --> 00:27.516
really of great commercial value.

00:27.536 --> 00:38.614
However, the rather short description of the book mentioned a woodcut on the title page representing a woman and a dog just found my attention, a secular representation in a religious book, question mark.

00:39.234 --> 00:44.923
The books were exhibited a few days before the sale, and I went to the exhibition to look at the little volumes.

00:44.943 --> 00:49.731
The moment I saw the title page, I realized that the woman was not a woman and the dog was not a dog.

00:50.234 --> 00:53.560
Much more appropriate to the text is to be represented St.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.000
Jerome.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.162
That's a wonderful story.

00:55.182 --> 00:55.423
St.

00:55.443 --> 00:56.264
Jerome and the Lion.

00:57.045 --> 01:00.952
However, the cataloger who described it as a woman and a dog could be excused.

01:00.972 --> 01:09.847
The style of the wood cover is far removed from the stuff, and the stiff representations usually found in 15th-century books, and the flowing down of St.

01:09.867 --> 01:11.770
Jerome could be taken for the one of the woman.

01:11.790 --> 01:13.153
You see, he understood, didn't he?

01:13.173 --> 01:14.054
He had his knowledge.

01:14.074 --> 01:14.655
Right, yeah.

01:14.922 --> 01:19.248
But he knew this, you see.

01:19.268 --> 01:21.471
He knew, exactly.

01:21.591 --> 01:33.548
Just as the nervous movement of the lion for the movement of the leaping dog, it was obvious that the illustration was the work not of the usual artist of woodcutting, but of a real artist.

01:33.568 --> 01:35.230
Who was he?

01:35.250 --> 01:42.300
I was now at the point where my former boss stood in front of my lathe to find a way to make it run.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.743
I'll let you see that he speaks about it.

01:45.095 --> 01:47.238
that he worked in the machine shop.

01:47.258 --> 01:49.361
And he had 10's up.

01:49.581 --> 01:50.703
And he worked all right.

01:50.723 --> 01:51.444
He was pumped.

01:51.464 --> 01:53.667
He was there every day, and so on.

01:54.328 --> 01:56.391
And I said, the machine stopped.

01:56.551 --> 01:57.292
And he stood there.

01:57.512 --> 02:09.549
I took a look at the imprint at the end of the text, which said, Basel, Bergman, B-E-R-G-M-A-N-N, Bond, small D-O-N, O-P-A-O-L-P-E, 1492.

02:09.569 --> 02:13.414
And here Mr. Knight, K-N-I-G-H-T, opened the spool and put the oil in.

02:13.951 --> 02:33.068
This was the printer and the period of the famous illustrator book, The Ship of Fools, by Sebastian Grein, the illustrations of which have been attributed to Albrecht Dürer, which I write about in my book, but I have a Dürer engraving on the cover of it.

02:33.088 --> 02:43.738
It needed only a little research to ascertain that the woodcut of a little book at the Swan Galleries was a work of Dürer, who at that time was traveling through Basel, where he worked for the printer Bergmann von Holfi.

02:44.242 --> 02:50.710
I bought the book at a low price and sold it shortly afterwards for what appeared at the time a very nice profit.

02:50.730 --> 03:00.203
Although it was not this profit which gave me so much pleasure, as the fact that it gave me back the confidence in the work I was doing and have continued to do until this day.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.745
Here I am ending my memoirs.

03:01.765 --> 03:10.256
The forty years that followed were not eventful enough to be recorded, and at least part of it was witnessed by those who have read the above.

03:10.276 --> 03:13.540
On the whole, there were happy years, and happy people have no history.

03:14.262 --> 03:19.488
My hope is that this happiness will last before the end of my days.

03:19.508 --> 03:20.209
This was written in August of 1987.

03:20.229 --> 03:21.310
It's very lovely.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.793
Yeah, and I had really pushed him.

03:23.813 --> 03:25.895
He never wanted to write.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.358
He never wanted to write.

03:28.819 --> 03:40.653
And then his grandson, the oldest one, wrote him a very nice letter and said, well, you say happy people have no history, but I'm still interested in what happened to you after.

03:40.673 --> 03:42.835
Well, I am too, actually, because...

03:43.574 --> 03:52.304
Well, you see the point was, he was so down in that machine shop, because he was not able to do anything.

03:53.005 --> 03:58.951
He was there in the morning at 8.30, or 8 or 7.30, whenever it was, he was never thinking about it.

03:59.232 --> 04:02.355
On Christmas Day, or New Year's Day, had a big party.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.460
And he came home and was drunk, he didn't drink at all, so.

04:07.148 --> 04:14.257
He had a bit of alcohol and was drunk, and he came home and said, this is the happiest day of my life.

04:14.277 --> 04:16.339
And the kids looked at me.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.403
So tell me then, he started?

04:20.084 --> 04:37.105
He started, so he said, the last days when it was pretty clear that the war would be over, he said, you know, maybe I should not leave there, because at least it's little that I earn, but I know what I earn, and God knows,

04:37.726 --> 04:46.575
When I start all over again, I said, oh, God, is his self-confidence so low.

04:47.376 --> 04:51.380
But the day that the war was over, he was fired.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.182
So there was no two ways.

04:53.222 --> 04:55.905
So what kind of work did he specialize in?

04:55.925 --> 04:58.087
Did he have a shop in New York?

04:58.187 --> 04:59.068
Did he?

04:59.588 --> 05:00.129
Oh, no.

05:00.629 --> 05:02.451
That come next.

05:02.952 --> 05:05.354
By that time, I wanted to go to school.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.176
I had already been, no.

05:07.561 --> 05:12.068
It was, I was not gentle, but I said, I cannot always say all this doesn't work.

05:12.829 --> 05:16.875
And so we discussed it, and he said, I will start from here anyway.

05:16.995 --> 05:18.898
Our apartment is big enough.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.282
Now, you're living up on 92nd Street?

05:21.302 --> 05:22.524
Did you move in with your in-laws?

05:22.824 --> 05:23.265
No.

05:23.285 --> 05:24.186
Oh, no, no, no.

05:25.188 --> 05:30.436
When he got the job with Erwin, all the time, he moved to Brighton Beach for two months.

05:30.536 --> 05:31.478
Everybody was sick.

05:31.678 --> 05:32.920
Florence had gifteria.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.122
Claude had gifteria.

05:34.142 --> 05:35.644
I mean, you know,

05:36.012 --> 05:41.900
And from there, I moved to Kew Gardens, not in this apartment, but to Kew Gardens.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.442
So you've moved here for 45?

05:43.462 --> 05:44.663
Since 541, since 41.

05:45.104 --> 05:45.184
Wow.

05:45.204 --> 05:46.225
Right.

05:46.245 --> 05:49.229
So where was Emil's business, out here in Queens or in Manhattan?

05:50.491 --> 05:52.453
I can show you his business.

05:52.473 --> 05:54.636
It still looks the same way as it looked.

05:54.656 --> 05:57.960
I'll show it to you if you want to get it up.

05:58.181 --> 05:59.562
So actually you can see it from here?

06:01.365 --> 06:04.669
No.

06:07.298 --> 06:11.604
We're now in the... So how long have you lived in this apartment?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.668
Since 1967.

06:14.688 --> 06:19.655
Okay, and so from this place, he operated his business for about 35 years or so.

06:19.675 --> 06:22.379
Exactly, and very successful.

06:22.399 --> 06:25.344
So most of his business was mail-added, would you say?

06:25.404 --> 06:27.607
Yeah, yeah.

06:27.627 --> 06:31.412
But he had customers who came, which he never liked.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.056
He said he liked his customers better if they don't come.

06:34.316 --> 06:35.618
And what was his specialty?

06:36.037 --> 06:38.340
You know, medicine and science.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.523
So he continued with medicine and science.

06:40.783 --> 06:41.164
Oh, yes.

06:41.304 --> 06:43.607
There was never any doubt in his mind.

06:43.627 --> 06:46.932
And this is his start, and this he would continue.

06:46.952 --> 06:50.396
Did he sell to institutions, to medical schools?

06:50.416 --> 06:53.821
Oh, yes, to many, and the Academy of Medicine.

06:54.161 --> 06:59.749
I saw the other day that they look for a new chief librarian.

07:00.674 --> 07:03.077
I don't know the name, but he knows them all.

07:03.217 --> 07:06.401
Did he acquire much material in Europe after the war?

07:06.521 --> 07:09.404
Yes, he traveled almost every year.

07:09.444 --> 07:12.067
Once a year, he went to Europe.

07:12.087 --> 07:17.413
So would you say that because he was a European, he knew where to go to get the material?

07:17.433 --> 07:18.435
Oh, yes, of course.

07:18.455 --> 07:22.860
He knew Munich, he knew Berlin, he knew Holland, he knew Paris.

07:23.380 --> 07:26.564
I mean, he knew Paris in particular, you know, Paris.

07:26.644 --> 07:29.247
And where were most of his customers here in the United States?

07:30.087 --> 07:30.748
would you say?

07:30.768 --> 07:31.268
Most, yes.

07:31.569 --> 07:39.377
So basically, you know, Roger Stoddard at Harvard University says it's, he really credits these emigre booksellers.

07:39.898 --> 07:42.661
Roger Stoddard was a close friend of him.

07:42.681 --> 07:44.503
Well, he's, you'll see in my book, I did.

07:44.904 --> 07:50.530
No, but maybe that was my, maybe I'm too touchy.

07:50.550 --> 07:59.520
It was very shortly, very shortly before, you mean, died.

08:00.968 --> 08:11.717
He had bought, he had sold neoclassic books to Studdard.

08:11.837 --> 08:13.338
Studdard was very interesting.

08:13.358 --> 08:14.359
Emil collected them.

08:14.820 --> 08:19.564
He loved them, didn't want to sell them, but finally he did sell them.

08:19.584 --> 08:22.706
And Studdard writes an article about them.

08:22.867 --> 08:26.830
I'm sure if you're talking about neoclassic books.

08:26.850 --> 08:30.553
I haven't seen them in quite a while, but I'll... Studdard didn't remember it.

08:31.057 --> 08:42.731
I'm just looking, I'm just looking at his stacks of... Well, you know, I told you, I've sold the whole business.

08:42.751 --> 08:43.171
Oh, you did?

08:43.331 --> 08:46.035
To John, to Hill.

08:46.455 --> 08:51.001
And I'm so amazed that... Who did you see you told me?

08:51.121 --> 08:57.368
The man who comes from Belgium.

08:59.575 --> 09:03.479
an antiquarian book dealer here who comes from Belgium, you told me something.

09:03.599 --> 09:07.763
He's a close friend of Jonathan.

09:07.783 --> 09:12.787
And Jonathan was really almost like a student of Emil.

09:12.888 --> 09:19.834
You know, there was such a relationship almost like between teacher and... He's in New York.

09:19.954 --> 09:21.296
He's in New York, yes.

09:21.316 --> 09:24.438
He does the same books as Emilie did.

09:24.499 --> 09:26.480
Now, why did he take this stuff?

09:26.681 --> 09:28.182
Because these were...

09:28.398 --> 09:29.760
And this I didn't give him.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.041
These were Amos Cardinals.

09:31.061 --> 09:31.522
Oh, I see.

09:32.022 --> 09:33.203
These were Amos Cardinals.

09:33.284 --> 09:33.944
I didn't give him.

09:34.465 --> 09:37.028
And these... Oh, and this is correspondence here.

09:37.288 --> 09:38.510
And this is correspondence.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.752
He wasn't interested.

09:40.972 --> 09:42.374
I gave him all the books.

09:42.614 --> 09:48.962
And how long that he was interested, I gave him because... And Jonathan was there.

09:49.042 --> 09:49.843
Care with me.

09:49.943 --> 09:52.285
And I sold him the business.

09:52.305 --> 09:54.047
And that was good.

09:54.067 --> 09:58.152
Because I know I did not want... So did Amos...

09:58.874 --> 10:02.018
He knew where to go to... In Europe.

10:02.199 --> 10:03.300
Indeed, he knew.

10:03.901 --> 10:09.929
A lot of people feel that, you know, that because of these... Is this where Jonathan Hill is right there?

10:10.690 --> 10:11.611
Jonathan, I'm sorry.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.794
Sorry, Jonathan R. Hill.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.338
That's his... It's Hill, not Hall.

10:16.799 --> 10:17.459
Huh?

10:17.540 --> 10:20.063
I wonder if he's still at 470 West End Ave.

10:21.665 --> 10:22.987
When was his catalog?

10:23.267 --> 10:25.911
If he's not there, he's...

10:26.532 --> 10:28.114
wrote further down.

10:28.154 --> 10:31.539
He's in the telephone, but I can't give you the telephone number.

10:31.559 --> 10:33.862
Oh, it's right here, it's right here.

10:33.882 --> 10:33.982
Yeah.

10:34.002 --> 10:35.124
7, 8, 5, 6, 8 o'clock.

10:35.604 --> 10:36.606
When is the catalogue?

10:37.066 --> 10:39.249
This is, uh, 93.

10:39.270 --> 10:40.852
93?

10:40.912 --> 10:42.694
No, he was in the old apartment.

10:42.714 --> 10:43.155
He moved.

10:43.996 --> 10:44.437
He moved.

10:44.597 --> 10:53.309
But, uh... But, um, I mean, you'll find the telephone very easily.

10:53.369 --> 10:56.353
I said he was a close friend of, I don't know...

10:56.637 --> 11:01.063
Not clothespens anymore, but Schreiber was a clothespender.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.728
So he, so basically, you know, was it books?

11:04.768 --> 11:06.611
Did he go in manuscripts?

11:06.691 --> 11:24.957
No, manuscripts was, well, I should say that, you know, at one point he had a customer who was in Cincinnati, who came to him, was interested in gardening, and wanted trees and all this, you know, and that was somewhat nameless life.

11:25.342 --> 11:32.591
But he became a very big customer and bought almost anything, and Emil bought for him in auction.

11:33.712 --> 11:36.596
So there were unusual things, you know.

11:38.057 --> 11:46.187
And I remember once we had the birds, who made the birds, well-known birds.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.449
Not Audubon.

11:47.469 --> 11:48.610
Audubon birds.

11:48.630 --> 11:51.874
One day, Emil bought that in auction for a Yale professor.

11:51.934 --> 11:52.335
Really?

11:52.415 --> 11:52.635
Yeah.

11:52.876 --> 11:54.117
I mean, that's...

11:54.518 --> 11:55.499
Is this Emil here?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.262
Yeah.

11:57.302 --> 11:58.304
This is Emil.

11:58.624 --> 12:00.908
No, no, this is Claude, I'm sorry.

12:01.088 --> 12:01.528
I'll show you.

12:01.569 --> 12:02.089
I have something.

12:02.109 --> 12:02.810
That's your son.

12:03.031 --> 12:04.012
That's my son, yeah.

12:04.413 --> 12:05.314
And that's when he works.

12:05.354 --> 12:06.957
But he has nothing to do with our books.

12:07.577 --> 12:09.000
Not the least bit interested.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.106
My daughter is, but he's not the least bit interested.

12:13.126 --> 12:20.857
So anyway, he had these Audubon birds, which he bought for a Yale professor.

12:21.338 --> 12:23.361
And I said, how will they get to Yale?

12:24.033 --> 12:26.116
And he said, you will drive me up there.

12:26.196 --> 12:29.041
I said, no way will I drive you up there.

12:29.521 --> 12:37.594
And if you have an accident in the car with the pictures of Yales, you bought them for $60,000, I pay for those?

12:38.475 --> 12:40.518
So the professor came down.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.021
Did he enjoy the business?

12:42.922 --> 12:44.064
Very much so.

12:44.404 --> 12:46.848
And he loved the books.

12:46.868 --> 12:49.332
And he had, you know, for instance, there was a

12:49.801 --> 12:55.689
He was studded, and there was a librarian in Yale who he liked very much.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.714
The librarians all liked him, and he liked them, and so on.

12:59.754 --> 13:01.317
Now he enjoys his life.

13:01.437 --> 13:03.980
So when he went to Europe, did he know where to go?

13:04.040 --> 13:05.362
Did he buy from individuals?

13:05.422 --> 13:06.724
Did he buy from schools?

13:06.744 --> 13:16.517
Because right after the war, they needed money, so he must have... In Paris, he knew everything that they had worked in Paris, for himself, for Mr. Bonnier.

13:17.003 --> 13:17.984
So he went down.

13:18.385 --> 13:22.910
And what kind of things were they looking for?

13:23.811 --> 13:26.294
They weren't looking for.

13:26.314 --> 13:27.756
What kinds of things?

13:27.776 --> 13:29.177
Well, he had many physicians.

13:29.598 --> 13:37.427
Just the other day, I talked to Jonathan, and Jonathan said, you know, and you wouldn't recognize the business anymore.

13:37.968 --> 13:44.175
We barely have a doctor anymore, because the doctors are not as

13:44.611 --> 13:46.333
flush as they were.

13:46.594 --> 13:48.777
What you get now is Silicon Valley.

13:49.377 --> 13:50.519
I said, well, I'm glad.

13:50.619 --> 13:51.560
I mean, isn't that out?

13:52.101 --> 13:55.045
So is this where he kept the stock in here?

13:55.085 --> 13:56.527
This is basically.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.810
So he really didn't keep that much stock on hand.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.793
He had about 300 books, I would say.

14:00.813 --> 14:01.414
That's all, huh?

14:01.434 --> 14:01.874
Yeah.

14:01.894 --> 14:03.617
So basically he brought and placed things.

14:04.077 --> 14:04.878
Right, right.

14:05.259 --> 14:11.327
And he, you know, the French book dealer, any decent book dealer in France has a personal collection.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.452
Amy never had a person collection.

14:14.472 --> 14:17.157
She said, I'm a book dealer, I'm not a collector.

14:17.417 --> 14:22.725
And so, if he hadn't been a collector, what kinds of things would he, you think he would like it?

14:22.745 --> 14:27.873
He had a book by Marie Curie with an inscription by her.

14:27.893 --> 14:28.975
And he kept that for himself?

14:29.596 --> 14:30.477
No, he didn't.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.121
He kept it a little bit longer than the other books.

14:33.141 --> 14:33.902
So who did he sell that to?

14:33.942 --> 14:36.326
I think it went to Jonathan.

14:36.346 --> 14:36.807
Ah.

14:36.827 --> 14:36.927
Yeah.

14:38.189 --> 14:39.330
So, you know.

14:39.350 --> 14:41.053
What do you mean, after Emil died?

14:41.073 --> 14:41.673
After Emil died.

14:41.693 --> 14:43.255
Well, so that he didn't sell it, he kept it.

14:43.636 --> 14:45.718
No, but he didn't have it very long.

14:46.119 --> 14:46.419
I see.

14:46.479 --> 14:51.906
No, it was not, it was not very long that he had it, so.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.529
That's, that's, that's, yeah.

14:54.549 --> 14:55.531
So, what else?

14:55.571 --> 14:56.572
This is great.

14:56.592 --> 14:58.374
Well, I didn't realize he worked here.

14:58.795 --> 15:00.156
He already worked here.

15:00.177 --> 15:01.378
I looked for something.

15:01.713 --> 15:04.316
No, this is probably not a name.

15:04.477 --> 15:06.419
Have you ever been to London to the dealers?

15:06.720 --> 15:07.441
Yes.

15:07.481 --> 15:09.363
Dr. Weill, is that a name for you?

15:10.685 --> 15:11.186
E-W-E-I-L.

15:11.406 --> 15:11.606
Yeah.

15:11.626 --> 15:13.308
And who is he?

15:13.449 --> 15:15.211
He was a book dealer in London.

15:15.231 --> 15:17.514
Was he also a German refugee?

15:17.774 --> 15:18.335
Oh, really?

15:18.355 --> 15:19.156
Is he still alive?

15:19.517 --> 15:20.178
No, no.

15:20.198 --> 15:22.420
He was considerably older than Emil.

15:23.282 --> 15:26.766
Who among Emil's colleagues are still alive, would you think?

15:27.387 --> 15:29.610
I talked to Phoebe up in Westchester.

15:30.113 --> 15:31.374
Yeah.

15:33.536 --> 15:37.000
I don't think any of the Germans is any more alive.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.843
And you said you are interested in the German Jews.

15:39.863 --> 15:41.765
Well, it doesn't, yeah.

15:41.785 --> 15:44.307
But I don't know.

15:44.327 --> 15:56.659
I think your best friend, and I don't know how pleasant he will be, how much he... Oh, yeah, there is also... Ah, there are two brothers.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.462
Well, actually, here...

16:00.910 --> 16:05.856
This is Anatole Brown, and Anatole Brown is not his name, and this is in French.

16:08.139 --> 16:10.382
Oh, this is an obituary, right?

16:10.402 --> 16:14.106
It's an obituary, which appeared in the English trade paper.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.649
Can I read it?

16:17.710 --> 16:17.891
Sure.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.513
Can I read it into my tape recorder?

16:19.533 --> 16:19.633
Do I?

16:19.813 --> 16:20.634
If you want to.

16:20.654 --> 16:21.075
It'll be quick.

16:21.095 --> 16:21.615
It's in French.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.377
No, it's in English.

16:23.397 --> 16:23.718
It's in English.

16:23.738 --> 16:25.760
This, and you might get these.

16:25.780 --> 16:26.401
I have these.

16:26.481 --> 16:27.402
You have that.

16:28.243 --> 16:29.685
So that's September?

16:29.851 --> 16:32.574
September 90, 1990.

16:32.614 --> 16:33.155
September?

16:33.175 --> 16:34.036
1990.

16:34.696 --> 16:35.577
September 10th.

16:36.018 --> 16:37.539
Oh.

16:37.559 --> 16:38.000
Every week?

16:38.420 --> 16:38.841
Yeah, every weekend.

16:38.861 --> 16:39.301
1990.

16:39.361 --> 16:40.483
And that's AB.

16:41.123 --> 16:44.607
That's AB, and there is his obituary.

16:45.889 --> 16:51.915
Page, obituary of Dad, page 85, I think.

16:53.397 --> 16:53.697
I'll find it.

16:53.717 --> 16:54.158
Yeah, that's in there.

16:54.258 --> 16:55.499
I have these at home, actually.

16:55.519 --> 16:56.400
You have these at home.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.063
I have a few others there.

16:59.083 --> 16:59.183
Okay.

16:59.753 --> 17:05.719
I think I put out the copies of it.

17:05.879 --> 17:08.522
It was a translation.

17:08.542 --> 17:12.746
Okay, so the death of Emil Offenbacho on August 16th is a very sad event.

17:12.786 --> 17:15.088
He was a nice, charming, modest, and clever gentleman.

17:15.649 --> 17:16.930
He had a quiet sense of humor.

17:16.950 --> 17:19.412
He managed to be brilliant without ever being flashy.

17:20.113 --> 17:22.556
More competent tens will say his place in the trade.

17:22.696 --> 17:29.102
I met him only about 1970, while he issued his first catalogs well before the Second World War.

17:30.128 --> 17:40.379
In fact, a few years ago, he laughed and laughed when I told him that two of his pre-war Paris catalogs had such an extravagant price in a French auction.

17:40.399 --> 17:44.082
In his main field, medicine and science, he had all the great books and knew everything.

17:44.623 --> 17:52.411
He was fond of the obscure, interesting books with an innocuous title, like Sulzer, S-U-L-Z-E-R's pre-Galvanic discovery.

17:52.812 --> 17:58.017
He had a supreme knowledge of the rarity of books and a remarkable instinct for what was a good book.

17:58.037 --> 17:59.038
That's good in quotes.

17:59.407 --> 18:06.015
While he was an expert in various fields, far from his main subject, notably Neo-Latin poetry, his forte was chemistry.

18:06.595 --> 18:11.000
He had helped to assemble the foremost collections in this field, built since about 50 years.

18:12.082 --> 18:16.507
That he much contributed to the Duveen, D-U-V-E-E-N, that was the person you mentioned.

18:16.587 --> 18:23.895
Collection is well known, but he did the same for many others, notably the Sondheimer, S-O-N-D-H-E-I-M-E-R, collection.

18:24.483 --> 18:26.186
He was not a tycoon of the book trade.

18:26.206 --> 18:33.879
He was probably the most knowledgeable dealer in his field, working in the Tauber, T-A-U-B-E-R, slash Weil, W-E-I-L, tradition.

18:34.560 --> 18:50.406
But in my opinion, incomparably more serious than Dr. Weil, who in many cases had to rely on his own sole authority, a phenomenon not too far from what the French call esbouffe, E-S-B-R-O-U-F-F-E, of legendary rarity.

18:50.825 --> 18:56.573
was most carefully used by Mr. Offenbacher, that's a phrase, of legendary rarity.

18:56.593 --> 19:10.273
He did not tamper with bindings, provenances, samulbans, as a few others who liked to manufacture the ideal copy of an interesting book and smartly used the skill of binders or an endpaper inscribed by Hugo or NX Libres by Lavoisier.

19:11.415 --> 19:19.026
His career was very long, but he admirably adapted to the new trends of the trade, while in the 40s he had exchanged a copy of Hooke's, Lectiones,

19:19.782 --> 19:36.361
L-E-C-T-I-O-N-E-S C-U-T-L-E-R-I-A-N-A-E, against a copy of Newton's Cachepia, he would perfectly accept the fact that Hooke's book was much less appreciated in absolute terms in the 70s, and he would continue buying it and selling it at the right price.

19:37.121 --> 19:41.987
He bravely bought for hundreds of dollars the books which at the beginning of his career could not be sold at $5.

19:43.168 --> 19:46.532
More important, he continuously improved his bibliographical knowledge

19:47.153 --> 19:55.823
using systematically the new tools as DSB-PMM, those must be bibliographies, although no one knew better the limitations of these works.

19:56.643 --> 20:07.796
Well, in some sense, every good dealer in medicine and science has been his pupil, his death, and the retirement of Mr. Gurney, G-U-R-N-E-Y, probably his only peer in the Anglo-Saxon world, marked the end of an era.

20:08.396 --> 20:10.178
Anatole Braun, B-R-A-U-N.

20:10.198 --> 20:11.300
Who is Anatole Braun?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.503
He has an entirely different name.

20:14.523 --> 20:15.304
He's a Frenchman.

20:15.723 --> 20:18.948
who met Emil a few times in science.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.009
So this is not his name?

20:20.190 --> 20:21.732
No, not his name.

20:21.752 --> 20:23.955
And I don't know his real name.

20:23.975 --> 20:25.077
Where did this appear?

20:25.417 --> 20:27.200
In the English paper.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.562
Oh, I see.

20:28.642 --> 20:31.286
So that's basically the counterpart of the AB maybe?

20:31.306 --> 20:32.267
Right, yeah.

20:32.347 --> 20:33.008
I see.

20:33.329 --> 20:34.230
It's the English paper.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.335
So he had this reputation in England as well, apparently.

20:37.355 --> 20:39.017
Oh, absolutely, yes.

20:39.037 --> 20:42.422
Yeah, he was kind of international for the

20:43.499 --> 20:45.582
albeit a small area.

20:45.602 --> 20:48.145
I mean, you know, he didn't touch anything.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.168
Now, did you work with your husband in the business?

20:51.129 --> 20:51.409
Never.

20:51.970 --> 21:00.882
I mean, when I retired, when I was 70 and was retired, and even had some doubt if I wanted... Now, this is one... That's the AB piece.

21:00.902 --> 21:01.362
Yeah.

21:01.382 --> 21:09.313
That's another AB piece, the one that you... Yeah, it has a date here, November 2, 1994.

21:11.295 --> 21:13.438
And I thought I had a third one.

21:14.195 --> 21:29.871
There was a very long one of one of also a younger book dealer who was very fond of Emil.

21:30.431 --> 21:37.859
But Emil kind of had taken more to Jonathan Herold, but they were good friends too.

21:38.279 --> 21:39.941
But I forget his name right now.

21:40.561 --> 21:43.324
He is a book dealer and his father is a book dealer.

21:43.591 --> 21:48.556
And the brother is better known, who deals much in Spanish books.

21:49.357 --> 21:49.717
No, no.

21:49.737 --> 21:49.957
No.

21:50.478 --> 21:51.659
I'll ask Jonathan.

21:51.679 --> 21:52.440
Jonathan, yes.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.802
OK, anything in there I should know about?

21:54.922 --> 21:59.267
No, there are some photos, which are not particularly good.

21:59.427 --> 22:00.648
Can I just take a look at it?

22:00.668 --> 22:01.309
I can see.

22:01.329 --> 22:03.831
Yeah, right, that you can see, yeah.

22:05.453 --> 22:08.216
And they're all, you know, enlarged.

22:10.238 --> 22:10.758
Grandchild?

22:10.778 --> 22:12.400
It is one grandchild, yeah.

22:13.139 --> 22:16.263
And all the grandchildren and the children live outside of New York?

22:16.283 --> 22:18.185
They all live around San Francisco.

22:18.445 --> 22:19.727
Which is beautiful out there.

22:19.927 --> 22:20.588
Right, it is.

22:20.788 --> 22:22.490
But you like New York?

22:23.811 --> 22:26.995
Well, I like New York, yes.

22:27.416 --> 22:29.238
At the beginning, I like New York.

22:29.258 --> 22:33.763
And then I have my place here, you know.

22:33.823 --> 22:38.809
This place where I go is a place for retirement home, and I'm not...

22:39.380 --> 22:45.689
Can I just take a quick look again at the autobiographical, the memoir that your husband wrote for his grandchildren?

22:46.611 --> 22:47.252
Don't you think?

22:47.552 --> 22:48.854
Did I just put it away?

22:48.874 --> 22:50.517
I think you put it away.

22:50.557 --> 22:51.358
I just read the end.

22:51.398 --> 22:55.404
I just want to just briefly see if there's anything about bookselling that I should know about.

22:57.026 --> 22:58.729
So you talked him into doing this, right?

22:59.009 --> 23:00.251
You suggested he do this.

23:00.472 --> 23:02.034
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:02.054 --> 23:02.795
Absolutely.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.197
Oh, this?

23:04.317 --> 23:06.180
Yeah, the biography I did, yes.

23:06.532 --> 23:10.717
The books, he was involved with books long before he knew me.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.962
Siegfried Schwarzschild.

23:14.982 --> 23:15.603
That's his uncle.

23:15.863 --> 23:17.225
That's the uncle.

23:17.385 --> 23:24.073
S-I-E-G-F-R-I-E-D-S-C-H-W-A-R-Z-S-C-H-I-L-D.

23:24.093 --> 23:26.456
I would not want you to use his name.

23:26.776 --> 23:29.299
Because he has still relatives here.

23:29.339 --> 23:32.103
I mean, that's what I... He was the Uncle Fritz.

23:32.363 --> 23:35.106
He was the Uncle Fritz, right, yeah.

23:35.507 --> 23:35.727
Okay.

23:35.747 --> 23:35.847
Okay.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.762
I'm just going very quickly here, as you can see.

23:38.883 --> 23:39.444
I do not.

23:39.464 --> 23:40.806
I mean, that's... That's fine.

23:40.827 --> 23:42.830
I understand.

23:42.851 --> 23:44.374
Your husband never went to high school?

23:44.694 --> 23:44.955
No.

23:45.877 --> 23:46.618
I told you that.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.602
He went to eighth grade.

23:50.446 --> 23:53.211
That's always... So he's not formally educated.

23:54.136 --> 24:00.823
I told you that in the beginning because that's what everybody always asks.

24:00.843 --> 24:05.008
At the age of 16, my father placed me in a small banking firm in Frankfurt.

24:05.568 --> 24:09.973
His opinion was that training as a banker was the best basis for any non-academic career.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.575
I worked in the bank for three years.

24:12.436 --> 24:21.966
Looking back at that time, I am surprised at the enthusiasm I brought for my work, which during its latter part included some lively participation in the stock market.

24:22.688 --> 24:26.232
I am sorry to say that I did not derive any profit from that training.

24:26.252 --> 24:27.593
So anyway, we can go over.

24:27.613 --> 24:28.834
I didn't realize he was not.

24:29.595 --> 24:34.240
No, he was really the trustee, the basic age he is.

24:34.520 --> 24:45.291
Well, in 1928, it was decided that I should leave my parents' house, and my father found me through one of our relatives, a non-paid position in one of the prominent Berlin art galleries.

24:45.311 --> 24:46.372
You told me that.

24:46.392 --> 24:46.492
Yeah.

24:46.552 --> 24:47.293
An auction house.

24:47.353 --> 24:51.177
The owner called G-R-A-U-P-E, I think it was.

24:51.933 --> 24:53.275
It was a remarkable myth.

24:53.295 --> 24:57.962
So his father didn't want him, didn't encourage him to go on to school?

24:58.763 --> 24:59.024
No.

24:59.364 --> 25:08.357
No, nobody got, you know, in Germany, you learned reading in the first, eighth grade and learned the basic of math in the first, eighth grade.

25:08.798 --> 25:14.286
And unless you wanted to do study, you didn't go any further.

25:15.348 --> 25:20.235
You go one extra year because that kept you a little bit better in the army.

25:20.570 --> 25:30.023
But this Paul who, Graupe, that was the person who basically gave your husband the idea that he might want to go into the book.

25:30.063 --> 25:32.065
No, it was Uncle Emil.

25:32.186 --> 25:34.168
I see, that's right.

25:34.188 --> 25:38.995
At the time I came to his business, it was located in a palace in one of the most elegant quarters of Berlin.

25:39.475 --> 25:41.298
There was a lot of snobbishness, blah, blah, blah.

25:41.318 --> 25:43.641
The head of the inter-Korean book department was a young man.

25:43.992 --> 25:49.578
Yeah, he committed suicide later on.

25:50.979 --> 25:58.507
He immigrated to England and committed suicide, one of the many who did not really survive.

25:59.428 --> 26:04.914
Well, the auctions themselves were society events where I got acquainted with the Berlin elite.

26:04.974 --> 26:13.543
I remember only a few of these people, one of whom was Dr. Richard Strauss, a composer who collected English color prints of the 18th century.

26:14.215 --> 26:16.679
I told you it's a little bit like self-speed.

26:16.699 --> 26:18.922
...that I began my career at the wrong end.

26:18.942 --> 26:26.574
Dealing in real books can, for some gifted individuals, become a glamorous profession, although only really as much as that of a dealer in great art.

26:27.055 --> 26:31.822
But for the majority of the profession, it is a moderate, though often fascinating, undertaking.

26:31.842 --> 26:37.651
And how moderate a way I have to create a bookseller operates was made evident to me by my second job in the field.

26:37.671 --> 26:41.657
After a year and a half in Berlin, I should spend a half a year in Paris,

26:42.042 --> 26:43.344
You told me about this.

26:43.764 --> 26:48.229
Monsieur Frederick, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C, Monnier, M-O-N-I-E-R.

26:49.511 --> 26:53.536
A small shop in the Rue des Clichy, C-L-I-C-H-Y.

26:53.616 --> 26:59.223
That's interesting, only because it's not at all in the car team where all the book dealers are.

27:03.087 --> 27:03.908
Okay.

27:04.649 --> 27:05.430
Well, this is good.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.593
I'm really glad you're doing it.

27:07.613 --> 27:09.775
I'm only interested in the book stuff, as you can say.

27:10.456 --> 27:11.377
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

27:11.437 --> 27:11.998
I just don't.

27:12.687 --> 27:21.098
He was happy at Munich, and even more so after I was joined by Anne, and it's A-N-N-E, you have an E in the name, okay.

27:21.118 --> 27:35.837
Who continued to lock her law studies at the university after having attended... Now, I had 13 years of school, because you couldn't go to the university, but nobody... And I always wanted to study law, so... So you studied at Heidelberg?

27:36.718 --> 27:37.699
I started in...

27:38.472 --> 27:41.917
Heidelberg, then Jönig, then Frankfurt, then Jönig again.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.900
And you were introduced by his brother, Eric.

27:44.360 --> 27:44.561
Right.

27:44.581 --> 27:45.923
Who had known him from some time.

27:46.944 --> 27:48.326
He fell in love with Anne Wright.

27:48.466 --> 27:48.586
Right.

27:50.549 --> 27:55.236
Her motto was, Wer glücklich ist, verdient zu sein.

27:55.777 --> 27:58.320
The one who is happy deserves it.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.502
Happy deserves being happy.

27:59.887 --> 28:00.608
That's great.

28:00.628 --> 28:01.309
Yeah.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.233
It's Dehmel, D-E-H-M-E-L.

28:04.253 --> 28:06.195
I mean, it's a German poet who says that.

28:06.276 --> 28:09.059
Let me just say what he said about you.

28:09.079 --> 28:16.890
She was and is the most cheerful person I ever met, and her cheerful outlook on life has sustained me now for more than 50.

28:18.512 --> 28:19.213
Exactly.

28:19.313 --> 28:26.923
He always said, he never said he married me because I was beautiful or bright or anything, but only because I was always in a good mood.

28:27.578 --> 28:32.425
And I can tell you it took a few years where it was hard to be in a good mood.

28:33.586 --> 28:45.883
You know, when he was interned and I had a baby of two months and a boy of three years and no money and no person in the near neighborhood.

28:45.903 --> 28:47.485
Let me read this because this is very important.

28:48.006 --> 28:56.978
On January 31st, 1933, I passed by a news poster named Ludwig Strasse, L-U-D-W-I-G S-T-R-A-S-S-E,

28:57.262 --> 28:58.363
in Munich.

28:58.383 --> 29:01.848
The wording was short but probably the most portentous of the century.

29:02.549 --> 29:13.363
It said that the president of the German Reich had appointed Adolf Hitler, the leader of the strongest party in the German parliament, as chancellor.

29:13.903 --> 29:18.029
The triumph of evil, long dreaded but never really believed, had arrived.

29:18.049 --> 29:21.994
I decided to go home to Frankfurt and await further developments.

29:22.014 --> 29:25.378
I spent the rest of the year in my palace house doing some business on my own.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.632
But much of this time was spent by making plans for the future.

29:28.672 --> 29:31.795
The measures the Nazis took against the Jews were applied progressively.

29:32.436 --> 29:38.160
This led many Jews to delude themselves by wishfully thinking that they could accommodate themselves to the changed conditions.

29:39.061 --> 29:43.885
Since the alternative was leaving their homeland to start a new life in a foreign country, a difficult decision to make.

29:44.386 --> 29:46.007
Their hesitation was understandable.

29:46.027 --> 29:49.190
Nobody was able to pursue the horrible ending of the story that had just begun.

29:50.070 --> 29:55.635
The decision of my mother at the time had come for us to leave the country, which you told us, which saved us.

29:56.155 --> 30:01.623
The reasoning was that while there might still be time to leave later, the time to be admitted by other countries would be limited.

30:02.143 --> 30:03.505
This was a prophetic view.

30:03.525 --> 30:06.790
By the end of 1933, the dispersion of our family began.

30:07.651 --> 30:15.081
One year later, my parents had found a new home in Amsterdam, and with them, my youngest brother and my only sister, who both later settled in Palestine.

30:15.101 --> 30:19.467
My brother Eric had left for America, and I started to build myself a new existence in Paris.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.833
With money provided by my father, I was able to buy a section of Mrs...

30:24.033 --> 30:26.697
Halle Stark, H-A-L-L-E, which you told me.

30:27.297 --> 30:34.387
These were all books in the exact and occult sciences and some medicine, which determined the direction of my business up to this day.

30:34.627 --> 30:38.052
I forgot the occult sciences, but you kept them up, actually.

30:38.072 --> 30:45.202
My office was a hole in the wall on the ground floor of an apartment building near the Medellin, M-A-D-E-I-N-A, Madeleine.

30:45.222 --> 30:50.749
It consisted of two bookshelves with a small desk in between and very little space to move around.

30:51.151 --> 30:56.178
Anne had already moved to France several months earlier after she had found a job in an orphan asylum in Paris.

30:56.198 --> 30:57.380
You told me all about that.

30:57.560 --> 30:57.720
Yeah.

30:57.981 --> 30:58.381
Okay.

30:58.421 --> 31:03.989
In August 1934, you were married by the mayor of the 8th Alain Giesemar in Paris.

31:05.131 --> 31:05.791
Okay.

31:05.811 --> 31:09.817
I'm going to go ahead.

31:09.917 --> 31:14.824
One day, an Englishman of about my age appeared in my office and asked if I had any early books on alchemy.

31:14.904 --> 31:15.805
That was the subject.

31:16.006 --> 31:17.648
A-L-C-H-E-M-Y.

31:18.151 --> 31:20.354
This was one of my specialties at that time.

31:20.494 --> 31:22.918
I eagerly took one book after another from my shelves.

31:22.958 --> 31:25.822
The customer looked at them shortly and piled them up on my desk.

31:26.503 --> 31:29.287
When I showed him everything I had, he asked, any more?

31:29.788 --> 31:31.430
And then said, please send them to me.

31:32.051 --> 31:45.150
He gave me his card, which showed that his name was Denis, D-E-N-I-S, one N, Duveen, D-U-V-E-E-N, and that he lived in one of the elegant new apartment houses near the Invalides, I-N-V-A-L-I-D-E-S.

31:45.170 --> 31:45.711
Invalides, yeah.

31:45.792 --> 31:51.179
It turned out that he was a chemist from a rich English family who was doing some work at the Sorbonne at the time.

31:51.219 --> 32:02.795
During a sickness, somebody had given him John Read, R-E-A-D, Read's book, Pray You to Chemistry, to read, which contained many attractive illustrations from early books and alchemy.

32:04.077 --> 32:15.613
Pardon me, these pictures had appealed to him, and he asked Maurice E-T-T-I-N-G-H-A-U-S-E-N, the only English bookseller in Paris he knew, this is the first thing he told me about.

32:15.897 --> 32:23.286
Whether these books were still available for purchase, Hayden Housen sent them to me, and he became my first substantial customer.

32:23.466 --> 32:28.792
It also was the first time that I had the opportunity to build up an important collection from its beginnings.

32:29.553 --> 32:31.395
Dennis was extremely generous to me.

32:31.475 --> 32:35.660
He never bargained and also let me work on the catalog of his collection.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.801
Oh, you didn't tell me that.

32:36.841 --> 32:37.923
That was very important.

32:38.403 --> 32:41.787
This meant, of course, an enormous change in our financial situation.

32:42.104 --> 32:44.827
as it relieved us from our constant worrying about money.

32:44.847 --> 32:46.668
So that was very important.

32:46.688 --> 32:49.291
Claude was born in 1936, and so there we go.

32:49.351 --> 32:49.691
You know?

32:50.912 --> 32:56.518
I think he does.

32:57.098 --> 32:58.620
I think that's excellent.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.101
Yeah, that's good stuff.

33:00.221 --> 33:04.265
You see, all I'm really interested in is... So tell me about his mind.

33:04.625 --> 33:04.986
Tell me.

33:05.026 --> 33:08.128
Now, you're a... What do you mean about his mind?

33:08.148 --> 33:09.009
Well, his intellect.

33:10.451 --> 33:11.892
He was a great reader.

33:12.108 --> 33:14.011
and a very careful reader.

33:14.471 --> 33:20.720
You barely open one of our books, that isn't what they called in France, trophée.

33:21.401 --> 33:22.883
You know what a truffle is?

33:23.043 --> 33:27.409
Something is put in, you know, where he is cutting out there.

33:27.750 --> 33:31.816
He was also an ardent writer to the New York Times.

33:32.797 --> 33:33.258
Wrote letters?

33:34.159 --> 33:35.501
Letters to the New York Times.

33:35.521 --> 33:36.382
Did they publish a lot of them?

33:37.203 --> 33:37.504
Yes.

33:38.765 --> 33:39.887
And so just...

33:40.120 --> 33:46.009
Now there is a book out, a new book on Thomas Mann by Anthony Heilberg.

33:46.790 --> 34:02.214
In the midst of the book, I think on page 41, 141 of 142, I cannot swear to it, I don't have the book here, it says, this information comes to me by Emil Offenbacher.

34:02.394 --> 34:04.217
No, I'm not kidding.

34:04.237 --> 34:08.363
Because it's not just from the New York Times that he got it.

34:08.383 --> 34:09.385
His mother was

34:09.753 --> 34:12.916
the girlfriend before I came onto the line.

34:13.296 --> 34:15.699
And we met each other again, you know.

34:16.840 --> 34:35.338
And Emil said that he felt, when you really did you see, that the L. Koenig pointed towards a homosexual relationship.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.818
You know, in fact.

34:38.858 --> 34:40.400
That's a surprise.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.743
Who's the author of this man book?

34:43.244 --> 34:44.345
Heilbutt.

34:44.365 --> 34:45.666
Anthony Heilbutt.

34:45.967 --> 34:47.188
H-E-I-L.

34:48.009 --> 34:49.491
I have it, I think.

34:49.511 --> 34:50.572
B-U-T-T.

34:50.592 --> 34:57.841
He wrote a very interesting book, which was called Riders in Exile.

34:58.101 --> 34:58.962
I know his book.

34:58.982 --> 34:59.082
Yeah.

34:59.230 --> 34:59.791
Yeah.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.173
Excited paradise or something.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.476
Excited paradise, something like this.

35:03.516 --> 35:07.662
He's the same age as my daughter, so they went to high school together.

35:07.782 --> 35:12.789
And they were never friendly, but the parents were friendly.

35:13.129 --> 35:17.495
And I heard him interview the other day on WQF, you know.

35:18.637 --> 35:22.542
The interview always in the afternoon, Lopat.

35:22.622 --> 35:24.445
I turned on the radio.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.166
because I cannot read as much.

35:26.226 --> 35:30.212
I had a cataract operation, and so I'm still a little bit handicapped.

35:30.232 --> 35:35.420
And so I turned on the radio more often than I said, huh, that all sounds very familiar.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.705
He interviewed Anthony, so I listened to it.

35:39.466 --> 35:49.041
So we were talking... So you wanted to know what... Well, he wasn't formally educated, but here he is recognized as the great bookseller in his field.

35:49.662 --> 35:51.705
Yes, because he worked on it.

35:51.965 --> 35:53.267
I mean, and he worked

35:55.272 --> 36:00.718
I mean, he really sat in his office for morning to night and was happy.

36:01.639 --> 36:14.833
Sometimes he played some music with it, but when he was very young at one point, I think he wanted to be a conductor, but that didn't last very long.

36:14.853 --> 36:20.178
And the other thing is that, I mean, he never wanted to study.

36:20.198 --> 36:24.823
Very strange, studied all his life, but never wanted to study.

36:24.922 --> 36:33.251
He came as a death from a very orthodox family, and you couldn't take every job, you know.

36:33.832 --> 36:35.874
You had all these restrictions.

36:35.894 --> 36:40.119
You didn't work on Saturday, you didn't do this, you didn't do that.

36:40.139 --> 36:52.393
And when he thought he wanted to be a composer, or not a composer, a conductor, his father told him very quickly, that's not for the wrong, what might you?

36:52.533 --> 36:54.135
You cannot do that, you know.

36:54.908 --> 37:01.117
strictly eating all these kosher food and so, you see, we were restricted.

37:01.397 --> 37:04.962
Can I just ask you briefly, why did you pick Queens?

37:04.982 --> 37:06.424
How did you manage to come out to Queens?

37:06.544 --> 37:07.906
I can tell you that exactly.

37:08.066 --> 37:12.753
My mother is, I don't know, my parents came here too before we came.

37:12.793 --> 37:15.617
They both died before we arrived.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.980
She had two brothers here who lived in Washington Heights.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.542
I don't know if you have ever heard anything about these.

37:21.742 --> 37:25.285
It was family reasons that they've worked.

37:25.305 --> 37:30.090
Washington Heights was full of Germans, of German Jews who had moved there.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.632
So I went up there.

37:32.852 --> 37:33.913
That's not for me.

37:33.933 --> 37:37.796
Two little children, high houses, old houses.

37:37.816 --> 37:45.283
And then someone said, I think it was my mother-in-law, said, why don't you go out to Queens one day who was with me in class?

37:45.517 --> 37:49.042
This out there, there you have Queens and things.

37:49.062 --> 37:51.004
So I went to Queens.

37:51.024 --> 37:51.745
Do you like it here?

37:52.166 --> 37:53.227
Love it.

37:53.247 --> 37:53.688
I love it.

37:53.968 --> 37:58.614
In between, Amy just said, you really should live in Manhattan.

37:58.634 --> 38:02.119
I said, all right, George, you go every day to Manhattan.

38:02.940 --> 38:05.463
You went every day to the public library, you know.

38:05.804 --> 38:07.306
You go every day to Manhattan.

38:08.187 --> 38:08.708
You look.

38:09.349 --> 38:11.271
I am working in Queens.

38:11.291 --> 38:11.912
I worked in

38:12.297 --> 38:15.400
I worked in Flushing High School.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.782
Or you did social work?

38:18.142 --> 38:18.943
Social work.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.385
As a social worker.

38:21.805 --> 38:23.387
Anyway, I said, you look.

38:23.407 --> 38:25.288
I mean, you have seen three apartments.

38:25.348 --> 38:26.950
We go and look at them together.

38:27.650 --> 38:31.354
That never was that hard.

38:31.374 --> 38:32.395
That's great.

38:32.855 --> 38:33.275
You know what?

38:33.295 --> 38:34.937
I'm going to get back into Manhattan.

38:34.997 --> 38:37.039
It's my third apartment here in Queens.

38:37.059 --> 38:39.361
But you've been here for 40 years, I think you said.

38:39.501 --> 38:39.881
Longer.

38:40.442 --> 38:41.022
58.

38:41.761 --> 38:44.685
Yeah, about, yeah.

38:44.745 --> 38:49.331
I mean, we came in this one since 58, but we came in 41 years.

38:49.391 --> 38:51.094
Well, that's 39 years.

38:51.114 --> 38:54.218
Yeah, in 41 we had a three-room apartment with two children.

38:54.679 --> 38:56.101
That wasn't very big.

38:56.121 --> 39:04.732
And we stayed much longer than we had planned to because the war came, because we thought as soon as we are now in two weeks, we'll find a bigger apartment.

39:04.752 --> 39:08.317
But first, there were no more apartments during the war.

39:08.357 --> 39:10.300
Nothing was built, and...

39:10.567 --> 39:11.889
We had no money either.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.313
Emil earned $15 a piece.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.336
Now, are these Emil's books?

39:16.356 --> 39:17.037
Are your books?

39:17.057 --> 39:19.240
A mixture of both of ours.

39:19.260 --> 39:23.927
Some, we left, as I said, everything in Paris.

39:24.067 --> 39:25.990
We had gone on vacation.

39:26.010 --> 39:28.013
They were thinking of not coming back.

39:29.415 --> 39:33.001
And then a friend.

39:33.021 --> 39:38.008
And we had a very decent, although we had just moved to Saint-Maudet from Vassette,

39:38.393 --> 39:41.256
The Monty was more elegant, and they had a large apartment there.

39:41.917 --> 39:44.980
And he had put everything we had in storage.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.784
He was a very decent man, because we lived there three months.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.567
And then we went on vacation and never came back.

39:52.708 --> 39:57.033
And after the war, we wrote him.

39:57.053 --> 40:02.399
And he wrote back that, indeed, he had all our furniture.

40:04.020 --> 40:06.443
And he had, you know,

40:07.030 --> 40:08.512
He put it all in storage.

40:08.893 --> 40:16.383
If we wanted it, he'd be glad to send it to us, provided we would pay him the fee that he had paid.

40:17.043 --> 40:25.335
If, on the other hand, we didn't want it anymore, he thought that we wouldn't mind if he'd sell the things.

40:26.656 --> 40:35.248
At that same moment, I wrote to a French friend who was still there.

40:35.802 --> 40:51.344
although Jewish but French, that if she could start dig up my study books so that I could show them to Columbia, because in order to get into graduate school in Columbia, I had to prove some proof what I had done.

40:52.505 --> 40:54.428
And she said she certainly would look.

40:54.448 --> 40:59.515
She looked, and then she wrote back and said, I found you, say, I'm the mayor.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.161
But let me ask you something.

41:02.362 --> 41:04.303
A, what do you want to do with your books?

41:04.443 --> 41:06.845
B, what do you want to do with your furniture?

41:08.927 --> 41:11.029
And we wrote back, not much.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.992
We would love to have our books sent, if that would be possible.

41:15.012 --> 41:18.095
And she said, I'd be glad to have your books sent.

41:18.115 --> 41:25.201
And I wondered if we could also have your furniture, because we have absolutely nothing left.

41:25.221 --> 41:26.682
So she got the furniture.

41:26.782 --> 41:30.345
And with part of the furniture, her parents came to

41:30.950 --> 41:32.011
San Francisco.

41:32.391 --> 41:33.372
Okay.

41:33.392 --> 41:35.334
And so you got some of the books back.

41:35.354 --> 41:35.474
Right.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.236
We got the books back.

41:37.356 --> 41:38.737
These are books that you left behind.

41:38.777 --> 41:39.338
Yeah.

41:39.758 --> 41:43.041
And that's why they are in such poor condition.

41:43.061 --> 41:45.543
They are all... And what year was this that you finally got them?

41:48.186 --> 41:48.966
After the war.

41:48.986 --> 41:50.468
Oh, so it was quite a few years.

41:52.109 --> 41:52.209
Yeah.

41:52.229 --> 41:52.329
Yeah.

41:52.349 --> 41:56.673
And half of them we threw out because they were in such poor condition.

41:58.155 --> 42:00.737
And some I knew, I knew some before here, but

42:01.426 --> 42:04.584
Most of them came from that.

42:05.248 --> 42:07.622
Listen, I've got to get into the city before I practice.
