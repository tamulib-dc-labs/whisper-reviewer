WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:10.536
I don't use it in conversation.

00:10.716 --> 00:14.700
Okay.

00:16.522 --> 00:22.689
And you've moved to your operation to England within the last year.

00:23.070 --> 00:26.814
Well, yeah, I mean, we've been playing this for a long time.

00:26.854 --> 00:31.759
My wife's English, and she came

00:32.026 --> 00:38.594
who lived in New York about 10 years ago and hated everything together.

00:38.614 --> 00:41.577
And I got sick of New York, too.

00:43.159 --> 00:53.852
So we decided about five years ago to pull up and leave as soon as we could.

00:53.872 --> 01:01.020
So it's more of a personal, domestic reason, and nothing to do, not so much... It was not... No.

01:01.400 --> 01:01.881
Although...

01:03.042 --> 01:08.888
Oddly enough, moving the business has been the easiest part of coming.

01:11.611 --> 01:19.478
And when we sold our apartment there, we already rented this place for a long time.

01:19.498 --> 01:24.403
And she had rented it before we were there.

01:24.423 --> 01:33.032
And we had a bit of luck, because this whole area of North London used to be out by even top.

01:38.530 --> 01:50.106
and that's why all the names around here have to be like Don's Road and Avenue and so.

01:51.828 --> 02:06.107
Anyway, Eton owned all these houses and they used to just rent them out to people and gradually they came getting out of the property business so they got a notice in the mail one day that this house had been sold to the

02:07.420 --> 02:12.208
what sounded like a somewhat shady property development called Tickback.

02:13.731 --> 02:20.622
Well, we didn't like the idea that Tickback was going to be our new landlord.

02:21.904 --> 02:30.158
And we discovered that we had the right, with other certain tenants in the building, to preempt the story.

02:30.178 --> 02:33.023
So we wound up buying the whole house.

02:33.847 --> 02:37.851
back to Vicky's mother in the downstairs thing.

02:37.871 --> 02:39.352
We could control that flat.

02:41.074 --> 02:49.962
We had this one upstairs with a short-term tenant, and on the top floor was another American who teaches violin.

02:49.982 --> 02:54.786
So with him, we bought the whole house for next semester.

02:54.806 --> 02:55.767
Oh, that's wonderful.

02:55.787 --> 02:57.228
Congratulations.

02:57.629 --> 03:03.634
So we came here, I think, about 10 months ago.

03:03.901 --> 03:13.810
sold one downstairs and relocated, my mother-in-law, for more than the whole house.

03:13.830 --> 03:17.574
So we're now sitting with these two.

03:18.995 --> 03:21.778
Most of our stuff is still in storage.

03:21.798 --> 03:32.608
And what I've done is convert that last day, which is not my brother, but on the family of the room.

03:34.327 --> 03:42.114
They're here, though, in London?

03:42.134 --> 03:42.835
They're here.

03:42.915 --> 03:46.638
I mean, I haven't seen them for a year and a half.

03:46.658 --> 03:48.840
Really?

03:48.860 --> 03:50.842
So, obviously, that's general stuff.

03:50.902 --> 04:03.473
There's no— I've moved all the better, but I'm a bit of a reference line.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.274
working out of this room.

04:06.294 --> 04:15.205
Well, the office was closed, paper, maybe not.

04:15.225 --> 04:16.947
It's been a long time.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.889
Yeah, well, here you are.

04:18.909 --> 04:31.705
And so, the last time that we moved out for a few years, and then I keep going up with black hair.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.121
We just bought this.

04:35.303 --> 04:37.585
You bought that?

04:37.606 --> 04:37.786
Yeah.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.689
I love that.

04:40.709 --> 04:41.250
Wow.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.152
You got my wife's attention on that.

04:43.673 --> 04:45.655
That's where it is right now.

04:48.618 --> 04:49.199
Wow.

04:49.219 --> 04:52.042
Well, I could do it.

04:52.062 --> 04:53.404
It's just not such.

04:54.686 --> 04:55.046
Wow.

04:57.889 --> 04:59.972
This is country.

05:01.113 --> 05:01.894
No, I'm going to

05:02.971 --> 05:04.272
move everything down there.

05:04.413 --> 05:08.537
London will just be appeared up here.

05:09.038 --> 05:16.706
In fact, part of the reason we chose this house is that's the 10s actually.

05:16.726 --> 05:19.589
We have 200 yards from each on the page.

05:21.171 --> 05:24.455
It looks like a pretty nice shape, too.

05:24.535 --> 05:25.756
It doesn't look like we have to do much.

05:26.017 --> 05:28.920
It needs a lot of cosmetic stuff.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.301
It doesn't need too much.

05:30.902 --> 05:31.763
Unfortunately,

05:33.852 --> 05:37.455
is double glazed windows, which we've got to take out.

05:38.116 --> 05:41.299
But this section, there's sort of three rooms here.

05:42.941 --> 05:44.322
They're pretty big, actually.

05:44.682 --> 05:45.984
That'll become the book rooms.

05:48.887 --> 05:52.470
How old is it?

05:52.490 --> 06:01.659
I think basically the earliest parts of it are the mid-18th century, although this village obviously goes back much earlier.

06:01.679 --> 06:02.880
And I know that

06:03.991 --> 06:06.515
Edward the Confessor stayed next door.

06:06.535 --> 06:12.104
There's a wonderful Anglo-Norman church sitting next, almost next door.

06:12.826 --> 06:15.750
So I'll become a country scribe shortly.

06:16.492 --> 06:20.979
That would be fairly weird, I guess.

06:20.999 --> 06:27.810
Most of your book business must be, I mean, obviously people don't come to see the material.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.775
Yeah, probably.

06:32.678 --> 06:40.349
I mean, they don't actually come here much either, so it doesn't really matter.

06:40.369 --> 06:48.621
It's not that much of a change because, in fact, not that many people came to the office and, I mean, people did come.

06:48.641 --> 06:57.894
But even in the middle of New York, we've got one or two people a day, I suppose, and most of those were just either chums or a waste of time.

06:58.095 --> 07:01.740
When we chatted the other day, we said, well, come on over, I'll tell you what I'm up to.

07:02.345 --> 07:16.699
Well, I mean, to be honest, when we moved here, I wasn't quite sure how it was going to work.

07:17.400 --> 07:27.930
I mean, the business had sort of established a pattern in New York.

07:28.130 --> 07:32.798
that's going to change in some ways, but it doesn't seem to be changing all that much.

07:34.520 --> 07:46.340
In fact, what I think will happen is that the number of customers will be smaller, and I'll deal with them in a somewhat more intense way.

07:47.722 --> 07:49.344
Could you increase it a little bit?

07:49.364 --> 07:53.491
I mean, you've been there, you know, we went to Vegas this morning, and we just left quarters.

07:54.393 --> 07:55.234
What they do is,

07:55.754 --> 08:04.125
Well, it isn't really that different actually.

08:04.205 --> 08:07.248
They just do it with a lot more people.

08:07.268 --> 08:15.739
It's a matter of temperament in a way, whether you like to do it yourself or whether you like to be part of a big group.

08:16.901 --> 08:22.808
But we sell the same kind of books to the same customers.

08:24.205 --> 08:27.149
I know their customers, and they know mine more or less.

08:27.209 --> 08:32.317
I mean, obviously they cover more areas if they have more people.

08:32.337 --> 08:43.513
But, I mean, in a way you could say this business is like one of Klerich's sections.

08:44.793 --> 08:54.485
You know, they have a literature department, an early book department, a travel department, an economics department, an Arabic department, whatever.

08:54.565 --> 09:13.129
I mean, I sort of function as one of their departments, but I have a little more freedom to hop about from subject to subject, whereas their departments are fairly self-contained and compete with one another, I think.

09:14.830 --> 09:18.536
say to yourself a specialty bookseller?

09:24.927 --> 09:31.318
Not a specialty bookseller, but there are some biases just based on my background.

09:31.338 --> 09:38.170
I mean, it's more literary than it is science and medicine.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.252
It's more

09:40.970 --> 09:46.956
It's probably more academically oriented than some booksellers would be now.

09:49.138 --> 09:56.065
I came along early enough so that I dealt with the library market more than the younger booksellers.

09:56.085 --> 10:02.752
And very interesting, by the way, that is a continuation of this book.

10:02.772 --> 10:10.099
Just because we never formally discussed it, can you just give me a brief background, biography?

10:11.497 --> 10:20.250
I went to Harvard, I don't know, class of 59.

10:20.270 --> 10:27.901
I was a math banker originally.

10:27.921 --> 10:39.098
But after three years, I could have fulfilled the requirements for my BA and decided that I wasn't going to be a mathematician.

10:39.118 --> 10:41.301
So I switched to English.

10:42.985 --> 10:49.192
and mostly did English courses my senior year.

10:49.212 --> 10:52.316
I stayed on it for graduate school.

10:52.336 --> 10:54.859
At Harvard, at Harvard.

10:54.879 --> 11:00.726
That's what I did in those days, to stay on the army.

11:00.746 --> 11:01.968
I went for the same period.

11:02.068 --> 11:04.391
Well, you must know how old you are.

11:04.411 --> 11:05.071
I'm 50.

11:05.091 --> 11:06.173
Fishing 54.

11:06.193 --> 11:11.759
I wound up a little older than you, but didn't know what I needed.

11:11.779 --> 11:12.300
I went to graduate at 65.

11:13.445 --> 11:19.393
I mean, in those days, going to graduate school was almost automatic.

11:20.014 --> 11:21.176
It brought you two more years.

11:22.017 --> 11:24.561
Well, it brought you as many years as you wanted.

11:25.462 --> 11:34.995
I mean, technically then, you could say a student, then there came a point where you had to be married.

11:35.015 --> 11:35.957
That came before.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.779
Yeah, that was about 61.

11:37.939 --> 11:39.462
And you had to have a kid.

11:39.702 --> 11:41.244
I got married at that point.

11:41.645 --> 11:43.367
You didn't need a kid until

11:43.668 --> 11:44.309
about 65.

11:44.589 --> 11:46.611
That's right, which is when I graduated.

11:46.631 --> 11:47.192
Yes.

11:47.612 --> 12:02.508
Well, I was, what happened was I did a year of grad in school, and I took a year off and sort of traveled, I spent most of it in Paris, and then traveling to Paris for a few months.

12:03.329 --> 12:12.699
I did that because I was the last year, at that point, my draft board was in Chicago, and that's where my parents were at that time.

12:12.719 --> 12:13.320
At that point,

12:13.672 --> 12:19.537
They were only drafting if you were over 23, from 23 to 26.

12:19.737 --> 12:26.083
And I was 22, so I knew I could drop the deferment for a year and then take it back.

12:28.044 --> 12:38.273
So I took a year off, and then I came back to graduate school, picked up my deferment, got married, which sort of helped continue the deferment.

12:39.855 --> 12:43.678
And so I was at graduate school over five years.

12:44.688 --> 12:57.484
I had almost gotten my PhD, but I took a course in the Houghton Library in the Arbor City, exactly the same as Arthur at Corrigan.

12:57.504 --> 13:00.107
We were talking to him right now.

13:00.147 --> 13:00.467
Yeah.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.371
Well, he's my classmate.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.032
I didn't know that.

13:04.192 --> 13:05.734
I bet I didn't know.

13:05.754 --> 13:07.496
I didn't tell him we were coming here.

13:07.516 --> 13:09.278
That's probably just as well as Mr.

13:15.552 --> 13:17.814
even though we were very close chums.

13:17.834 --> 13:38.077
And he and I got divorced at almost exactly the same time, although happily we can cause each other's divorce instead.

13:38.097 --> 13:42.201
About six months after, we were married.

13:47.530 --> 14:08.133
So, Arthur and I, we get along on that, but we're not as chummy as we used to be.

14:09.275 --> 14:13.119
But our backgrounds are very similar in the bookings.

14:13.139 --> 14:15.782
I mean, in fact, he was also a graduate.

14:21.179 --> 14:26.464
He went on, he did get his Ph.D.

14:26.584 --> 14:29.947
in with a professor at Boston University for a while.

14:31.748 --> 14:40.116
I think Uncle Harry was quite a famous Harvard English professor.

14:40.516 --> 14:44.760
He took this course from Bill Jackson.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.702
He did say Bill Jackson was his mentor.

14:47.723 --> 14:50.545
That's right.

14:51.841 --> 14:54.044
I mean, you know about Jackson.

14:54.325 --> 14:55.687
Oh, like you said.

14:55.707 --> 14:58.070
Yeah, and he wrote the four-pound catalogs.

14:58.090 --> 15:05.902
I mean, he was a fairly amazing bookman of the old school, really.

15:05.922 --> 15:10.429
If he hadn't been American, he would have been an English-haristic, actually.

15:10.449 --> 15:12.552
He was at that time.

15:12.572 --> 15:19.823
In fact, he kind of hobbobbed the aristocracy anyway.

15:21.271 --> 15:23.014
and became fascinated by it.

15:23.114 --> 15:26.339
I mean, I've never touched any old books before.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.561
I knew nothing about what kind of work.

15:28.342 --> 15:30.225
So you credit this course that you took?

15:30.245 --> 15:37.416
Yeah, Arthur took the course, because we were very close friends, and he was talking about it all the time.

15:37.616 --> 15:38.978
And I thought, that sounds interesting.

15:38.998 --> 15:44.287
And this was a course that was part of the graduate school curriculum.

15:44.307 --> 15:49.675
So I took the course the next year.

15:49.925 --> 15:55.333
with a third friend who we put up a silent partner late in 1961.

15:55.673 --> 15:59.098
Well, I put up $1,000.

15:59.279 --> 16:01.061
The other friend put up $1,000.

16:02.183 --> 16:08.672
Arthur, who never had any money at that time, but had already bought a few books one way or another.

16:08.692 --> 16:10.795
He put up $1,000 worth of books.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.342
And together, we started Syntomies.

16:22.645 --> 16:36.159
So, we did, how did it work?

16:36.679 --> 16:42.966
We formed a business, chose a name for it.

16:42.986 --> 16:44.988
And how did you think we chose a judge, Billy?

16:46.469 --> 16:49.412
Jimenez is actually the head name.

16:51.738 --> 16:59.871
the man who set the crossword puzzles in the London Observer, and I was sort of a crossword puzzle fan.

16:59.891 --> 17:09.086
You know, these really difficult English crossword puzzles, and they're not like the New York Times.

17:09.387 --> 17:10.329
I mean, I still do.

17:10.549 --> 17:14.916
You can see them lying around here.

17:15.838 --> 17:17.340
I mean, you know, you have to,

17:21.134 --> 17:24.598
This is the Sunday Observer puzzle.

17:25.679 --> 17:30.564
The reason you see it, it's now set by a man named Azad.

17:33.046 --> 17:35.669
He's the successor because Jimenez died.

17:36.670 --> 17:44.318
The first person who did the puzzle called himself Torquemada because the puzzles were so fiendishly difficult.

17:44.358 --> 17:48.022
He took a name from the Spanish Inquisition.

17:48.042 --> 17:49.183
When he died,

17:50.260 --> 17:56.527
His successor picked another name from the Spanish Inquisition, which was Cardinal Jiménez.

17:58.068 --> 18:09.280
And then when Jiménez, as they called in England, died, his successor just picked the name A-Z-A-T-Z.

18:10.161 --> 18:12.223
That was cool.

18:12.984 --> 18:13.604
In fact, when?

18:14.705 --> 18:16.167
It was about 19...

18:16.484 --> 18:25.877
early 1970s, when my office in New York, which was around 85th Street, the doorbell rang, and there was an Englishman there.

18:25.917 --> 18:32.887
He said, he just wanted to know why there was a book company called Ximenez.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.429
So I was startled by that.

18:34.449 --> 18:35.150
I told him.

18:35.170 --> 18:42.781
He said, oh, well, that's interesting, because I am Azay, the successor to Ximenez, and it was this man at my door.

18:44.103 --> 18:44.263
Right.

18:44.497 --> 18:51.885
I mean, he didn't care about old books particularly, but he just saw it in the phone book, I guess.

18:52.266 --> 18:56.750
And so he handed me a book of his puzzles and went away.

18:56.871 --> 18:59.554
And I keep meaning to sort of look him up here again.

19:00.415 --> 19:09.605
Anyway, we gave, you know, we chose the business end just sort of as a joke because it wasn't very serious.

19:10.906 --> 19:13.609
And we started buying books.

19:13.825 --> 19:15.467
good deeds.

19:16.829 --> 19:28.026
Also, Jackson, I think, sort of liked the notion that some of his students were actually trading at books.

19:28.046 --> 19:31.190
He was kind of a bookseller, Monquet himself.

19:31.410 --> 19:40.103
He knew a lot of his course not only had to do with what the books were, but how much they were worth and where you got them, and

19:41.078 --> 19:46.486
collecting world generally, and that was the sort of thing that appealed to me.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.129
Was it a bibliography course?

19:49.149 --> 19:51.392
It was technically a bibliography course.

19:51.412 --> 19:54.216
I mean, it was the most genteel course I ever took.

19:55.138 --> 19:56.039
It was wonderful.

19:57.241 --> 20:01.587
It met once a week on Wednesday afternoons.

20:02.047 --> 20:09.077
You had tea in the Keats room, and you sort of passed around Shakespeare quarters and things like that, while Jackson used to talk about

20:10.053 --> 20:19.045
where they came from, how much they were worth, who bought them, who sold them, and things like that.

20:19.065 --> 20:33.844
And plus all the technical details of bibliography, but I confess at that point, I think the kind of treasure hunt side of it appeared to me more than anything.

20:35.005 --> 20:38.490
To be honest, I wasn't that keen at a graduate

20:39.095 --> 20:40.717
I mean, I was good enough at it.

20:41.117 --> 20:48.965
But the notion of becoming an English professor, there was no alternative, you know, by the that or Vietnam.

20:50.387 --> 20:54.311
And suddenly this presented itself as an alternative.

20:54.331 --> 21:05.903
I spent most of my time in those, as my chief interests, was in playing poker, going to the racetrack, various forms of gambling, actually.

21:07.685 --> 21:08.005
And

21:08.339 --> 21:21.499
I think, although I didn't quite realize it at the time, that this business turned into a kind of respectable form of playing poker or going to the racetrack.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.063
I mean, it is a kind of gambling business.

21:24.985 --> 21:32.777
And in fact, ever since I've been doing this full time, my car flying and so on has more or less vanished business.

21:33.415 --> 21:38.420
And Arthur wasn't quite as involved in that, but he was a games-playing person, too.

21:38.460 --> 21:44.547
He was a chess player, and we had a lot of things in common like that.

21:46.428 --> 21:51.634
So we ran it together for about three years, along with his talent partner.

21:52.234 --> 21:54.056
Was he down in New York now?

21:54.076 --> 21:54.957
No, it was in Cambridge.

21:54.977 --> 21:55.698
Yeah, Cambridge.

21:55.778 --> 22:00.503
We issued three catalogues together.

22:00.905 --> 22:07.894
And then I decided that I wanted to do this full-time.

22:07.914 --> 22:19.508
So I chucked my thesis, which was sort of halfway done, into the wastebasket, and brought out Arthur and the other guy, I think for $3,000.

22:19.668 --> 22:21.711
I mean, some fairly trivial stuff.

22:21.851 --> 22:22.852
So they made a profit.

22:23.132 --> 22:24.034
They made a profit.

22:25.295 --> 22:27.638
Well, that was about all I had, anyway.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.714
So there wasn't much choice.

22:29.854 --> 22:34.941
And all of the books at that point were basically in that little glass bookcase.

22:34.961 --> 22:35.502
You still have it?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.143
It's still there.

22:36.383 --> 22:42.452
Yeah, that bookcase was bought in Cambridge for $25 at a local audience there.

22:43.173 --> 22:49.102
I mean, not a great bookcase, but it was much more than that.

22:52.707 --> 22:53.288
Yeah.

22:54.297 --> 23:00.265
In fact, I got married by then, so we decided the summer of 65, we picked up and moved to New York.

23:02.588 --> 23:10.760
Serendipitously, I had inherited $10,000 from my grandmother who died, so I had some working capital.

23:12.903 --> 23:15.967
Just what you needed in those days wasn't very much.

23:17.829 --> 23:22.376
Real estate in Manhattan was not that expensive.

23:22.476 --> 23:24.118
I mean, it amazes me now.

23:24.368 --> 23:31.356
When we moved to New York, our first apartment was, we chose between two on the Upper West.

23:31.616 --> 23:41.407
One of them cost $110 a month, and one cost $130 a month, and we decided to go for the cheaper one.

23:41.427 --> 23:50.136
And my office, little office on 45th Street, a block away from the old set of Gables, cost me $100 a month.

23:50.156 --> 23:51.878
I think I made it.

23:53.005 --> 23:55.228
And I'm just old enough.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.752
You haven't gotten yours yet, but you will in a few years.

23:57.812 --> 24:02.378
You get your Social Security history as you approach your 60s.

24:05.703 --> 24:09.408
Mine just arrived the other day, which shows my earnings in 1965.

24:09.528 --> 24:15.196
In the first year I earned any money, I think my tax return was $535.

24:15.496 --> 24:21.004
So it still was running through the $10,000 I even earned.

24:22.469 --> 24:26.595
And in 66, I think I made $6,000.

24:27.036 --> 24:35.569
Every year after that, you can't tell because I hit the Social Security threshold, so they just tell you that amount if you're in.

24:38.754 --> 24:42.259
So we opened the business in the fall of 65.

24:43.902 --> 24:51.413
And just about that time, it was, it must have been

24:51.916 --> 24:56.762
66 already, when they changed the draft rule again, you had to have a kid.

24:58.865 --> 25:03.090
My wife, after a long struggle, was pregnant.

25:04.031 --> 25:13.863
And I received my notice from my draft board to report for a physical about two days after we learned she was pregnant.

25:15.045 --> 25:19.510
So I knew that I wasn't going to be drafted, and

25:20.030 --> 25:35.432
At the same time, I still had to go to the physical, down in the steps of Lower New York, because it was too hard to cancel it.

25:35.452 --> 25:45.447
So five o'clock in the morning, I drifted down to the ludicrous physical exam, at which it turned out...

25:46.895 --> 25:49.279
Well, there was a very funny moment, actually.

25:49.299 --> 25:53.426
It was one of these things where you're with 500 other young men.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.291
Most of them in those days actually were Puerto Rican.

25:57.753 --> 25:59.516
And they'd give you an eye test.

25:59.536 --> 26:02.661
They'd say, look in there and read the third line.

26:02.722 --> 26:06.688
And it was this sort of microscope kind of eye tester.

26:06.708 --> 26:10.114
And I'd look in, and I said, I can't see anything.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.957
It was five in the morning.

26:13.253 --> 26:17.119
So they said, okay, and they're still in the form you were carrying around.

26:17.239 --> 26:20.924
I noticed it said both 2020 and both.

26:21.866 --> 26:33.743
After about an hour, I'd gotten to the point where there's a famous moment in all Army physicals where they examine the recruits' backsides.

26:33.763 --> 26:35.105
That's interesting.

26:35.125 --> 26:41.995
Yeah, there are 200 naked guys, and you're all sort of leaning over.

26:42.700 --> 26:49.692
And the doctors are walking down the aisle, and they go, okay, okay, okay.

26:49.712 --> 26:56.383
Well, I was right at the end of the line, and the team of Army doctors got to me, and they said, okay, and they walked.

26:57.084 --> 26:59.448
And suddenly one of them said, wait a minute.

27:01.051 --> 27:01.371
You.

27:02.513 --> 27:04.156
I said, what?

27:04.176 --> 27:06.280
I said, you've got a pyelonoidal cyst.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.303
I said, I know, so what?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.939
You're kidding.

27:11.959 --> 27:12.841
I had one too.

27:13.001 --> 27:13.642
They took me.

27:14.063 --> 27:14.543
I had one.

27:14.663 --> 27:15.765
Unbelievable.

27:15.905 --> 27:16.226
Really?

27:16.486 --> 27:16.967
Yeah.

27:16.987 --> 27:20.011
Well, that was the end of my physical.

27:20.051 --> 27:22.495
They sent me away, and they made me 4F.

27:23.617 --> 27:24.959
And a polynatal cyst.

27:25.439 --> 27:26.861
Yeah, well, yeah.

27:26.881 --> 27:28.564
One in ten people have it.

27:28.804 --> 27:30.226
So you know what I'm talking about.

27:30.266 --> 27:30.527
I had one.

27:30.547 --> 27:31.468
I had it removed in the Navy.

27:31.588 --> 27:33.211
I mean, on my ship, they took it out.

27:33.631 --> 27:33.972
Really?

27:34.012 --> 27:34.793
Yeah.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.557
See, I always refused to have mine removed.

27:37.577 --> 27:38.138
I had a...

27:38.810 --> 27:45.600
I had an uncle, who's a great uncle, who always wanted to remove it.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.124
He said, you know, you should have that operate on it.

27:48.144 --> 27:48.885
He was a surgeon.

27:48.965 --> 27:53.212
He loved operating on anything that moved.

27:53.232 --> 27:55.635
I said, well, you know, what harm does it do?

27:55.695 --> 28:02.826
In fact, the only disadvantage of the pilonodal cystic, it got inflamed if you rode around in a jeep a long time, you know.

28:08.172 --> 28:11.255
Well, you grow out of it anyway.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.879
I mean, it hasn't bothered me since my late 20s.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.422
Mine was pretty tough.

28:17.442 --> 28:17.902
I used to bleed a lot.

28:17.922 --> 28:18.803
Yeah, occasionally.

28:18.823 --> 28:22.527
I mean, if you did too much bike riding or something.

28:23.729 --> 28:28.193
When you're in your 20s, we could get sore sitting in lectures.

28:28.213 --> 28:29.455
It was kind of uncomfortable.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.936
It wasn't serious enough.

28:31.897 --> 28:36.222
Anyway, we had a physician on our ship who was dying to do a surgery.

28:36.725 --> 28:39.870
I had mine done over in the Tonkin Gulf, a guy that were all healthy people.

28:39.910 --> 28:41.552
He was desperate to do surgery.

28:41.712 --> 28:47.601
But I thought those—well, in the earlier days, the operation they used in the Army didn't work.

28:47.681 --> 28:48.502
It grew back.

28:48.562 --> 28:48.983
Wonderful.

28:49.524 --> 28:51.967
I had mine 31 years ago.

28:52.067 --> 28:53.289
I had never returned.

28:53.830 --> 29:00.660
Yeah, but you see, it was a waste of time because mine hasn't bothered me in 30 years.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.883
He showed me, you know, it was huge when he took that.

29:02.903 --> 29:03.003
Yeah.

29:03.303 --> 29:03.684
Absolutely.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.787
But it kind of, as you get older, sort of,

29:06.307 --> 29:11.032
It shrivels away, and anyway it's in your genes, and you pass it on.

29:11.372 --> 29:18.178
Well, I guess the mother, I think it comes, I mean my mother, I don't know.

29:18.198 --> 29:20.140
It comes through the mother.

29:20.160 --> 29:29.870
I don't know if that's true, but that probably had a couple of cysts in various places, and I was just falling out of them.

29:30.010 --> 29:31.471
Anyway, let's get away from it.

29:31.491 --> 29:31.932
Here we go.

29:32.072 --> 29:34.474
It was sort of ironic to me, because

29:34.741 --> 29:42.272
If they said then I was 4F, then all this business about staying in graduate school, et cetera, et cetera, getting married— Irrelevant.

29:42.292 --> 29:44.114
All irrelevant, I could have done anything.

29:44.695 --> 29:47.639
But they might not have seen it the first time, too.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.102
He knows, yeah, exactly.

29:49.122 --> 29:54.129
I mean, I said— They took me, I can tell you what they called me.

29:54.149 --> 29:55.571
You were just unlawful.

29:56.072 --> 29:59.196
That's the way it called me.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.653
You were lucky they turned around.

30:01.673 --> 30:04.016
But it wouldn't have mattered then.

30:04.076 --> 30:05.117
I didn't care.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.701
Anyway, that was the end.

30:08.302 --> 30:10.285
They sent me away halfway through the physical.

30:10.405 --> 30:11.486
I never finished it.

30:11.506 --> 30:14.911
So then you went and became a determined bookseller.

30:14.971 --> 30:16.954
Yeah, at that point I was a bookseller.

30:16.974 --> 30:24.845
Well, what I knew because of where I'd gotten my training was the first thing I knew was the library market.

30:25.025 --> 30:28.069
Harvard was our first customer because we used to buy

30:28.572 --> 30:33.117
We used to trade stuff with Jackson.

30:33.137 --> 30:41.027
You know, we'd find things locally, look them up in the Harvard catalogs and so on, because we didn't have any reference library.

30:41.487 --> 30:50.338
If we'd find out that they didn't have anything, he would take us down to the duplicate room and swap duplicates with us.

30:50.358 --> 30:58.427
In fact, I mean, the first significant book we ever handled, really, was the first edition of Paradise Lost, in my opinion.

30:59.032 --> 31:07.664
which we traded to him for some, a couple of other early English sermons.

31:07.684 --> 31:08.746
To Jackson?

31:08.786 --> 31:09.447
To Jackson.

31:09.467 --> 31:10.969
He didn't have a Faraday's Lot?

31:10.989 --> 31:12.251
He had a duplicate.

31:12.431 --> 31:23.787
We found, or actually it was Arthur who found them, actually, sort of across the street at one of the old secondhand bookstores there, a little pile of early English sermons.

31:23.948 --> 31:24.689
In Cambridge?

31:24.909 --> 31:26.051
In Cambridge.

31:26.071 --> 31:26.271
And,

31:26.555 --> 31:28.658
Arthur bought them for a dollar each.

31:28.878 --> 31:30.921
I think there were 11 of them.

31:31.862 --> 31:44.998
So we looked them up and found out Harvard didn't have some of them, so we traded something like four sermons for five sermons for a first edition of Paradise Lost, which we then sold.

31:45.018 --> 31:47.081
I think it was our first sale to the library.

31:47.101 --> 31:48.623
We sold to Penn State.

31:49.063 --> 31:52.748
I don't know how we knew that they didn't have one, but

31:53.707 --> 32:00.319
And Charlie Mann, the librarian there, who's still the librarian, bought it from us for, I think it was $250.

32:00.359 --> 32:00.440
Wow.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.944
That's been crazy.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.229
That was good profit.

32:05.449 --> 32:07.693
Well, that was the kind of thing that appealed to me.

32:07.773 --> 32:08.815
I thought, this was fun.

32:09.997 --> 32:15.107
And in a sense, I've always felt that there's at least a certain kind of bookseller.

32:15.762 --> 32:22.911
a key ingredient to doing this is you have to like the idea of finding something for a dollar and selling it for a thousand.

32:22.951 --> 32:27.037
I mean, if that's not fun, you're in the wrong business.

32:27.057 --> 32:32.964
I mean, admittedly, there are booksellers, I suppose, who don't care about that, but many of us do.

32:33.025 --> 32:35.067
I mean, that's one of the kicks you get out of it.

32:35.107 --> 32:39.473
You're constantly on this sort of treasure hunt, and it still happens.

32:39.573 --> 32:42.597
I mean, part of the fun of it, I still feel,

32:43.252 --> 32:50.038
go to a book fair or whatever, find something for 20 pounds that I can sell for 500 pounds.

32:50.058 --> 32:54.943
Now, do you think that you know somebody's interested or do you just recognize immediately?

32:56.544 --> 33:03.471
I mean, I suppose it would be unfair to say I don't know that anybody's interested in it, but that's not really the way.

33:03.491 --> 33:06.033
I don't buy books for specific people.

33:06.113 --> 33:10.457
I kind of buy a kind of book that interests me

33:11.112 --> 33:16.238
And therefore, over the years, I have customers who are going to be interested in it.

33:16.258 --> 33:23.427
But, you know, many times I'll buy it and then sit down and think, oh, well, I might as well offer it to so-and-so.

33:23.908 --> 33:26.371
But that's sort of a secondary consideration.

33:26.471 --> 33:27.672
I've bought it already.

33:29.314 --> 33:35.182
I was up in Toronto a couple weeks ago, and Thomas Fisher and we were talking to Richard.

33:35.202 --> 33:37.344
Right, and the captain's group up there.

33:38.366 --> 33:39.567
And he mentioned that...

33:40.627 --> 33:45.053
York University, where it was founded in the 60s, which is up in Toronto.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.735
York University.

33:46.915 --> 33:48.237
They didn't have any books at all.

33:48.978 --> 34:01.555
So as he told me, a core collection, they went to Star Bookstore, bought out all of their books, and then went to a place in Montreal, Ducharme, I guess, and borrowed all of their books to get some French claim.

34:01.695 --> 34:04.359
And that was basically a core thing.

34:04.379 --> 34:08.845
Well, that was one thing, and if you were in the business in this,

34:09.112 --> 34:32.262
50s and 60s, it made it a lot easier to get started because it was a period of huge expansion of all these North American libraries, and they had more money than cents, and big budgets being allocated to library development because they thought then that in order to be a respectable school, you had to have a respectable library.

34:33.463 --> 34:37.228
So they had...

34:37.445 --> 34:41.691
more than enough money to buy all the imprint things they wanted.

34:41.711 --> 34:50.785
So they used the leftover to buy retrospectively, which often included antiquarian books.

34:51.686 --> 34:55.151
Not just out-of-print books, but old books.

34:57.074 --> 35:05.967
And so in those days, if you sent out a catalog, you would often get these rather astonishing orders from long days that I remember in the

35:06.655 --> 35:08.777
I thought it was in on the tail end of that.

35:08.837 --> 35:16.505
I said, it was really big in the 50s when libraries would walk in and buy your whole stock.

35:16.585 --> 35:17.165
They lived there.

35:17.586 --> 35:20.288
It was possible, yeah.

35:22.030 --> 35:26.094
But I remember early catalogs I sent out to Newark.

35:26.154 --> 35:35.363
You got orders from places like the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

35:35.849 --> 35:45.064
You had 350 items in a catalog, and they'd order everything under $100, which was a lot of items in those days.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.209
You could buy a lot of good books for under $100.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.934
Did they get your first catalog next time out, probably?

35:50.954 --> 35:53.398
Well, they didn't actually.

35:53.418 --> 35:57.064
They'd ordered three months late, which was great.

35:57.854 --> 36:03.102
You know, your customers you knew would get first crack, and then they'd come along and sweep up everything else.

36:03.142 --> 36:06.326
They'd order 175 items or anything like that.

36:07.768 --> 36:14.318
It wasn't a lot of money or anything, and it was already fading in the late 60s.

36:14.338 --> 36:19.645
But in those days, I dealt with lots and lots of libraries.

36:19.665 --> 36:27.777
And the history of the business has been that those numbers have been gradually shrinking until

36:28.077 --> 36:33.644
I mean, now, I've cut them all off the mailing list, practically.

36:34.165 --> 36:41.354
I mean, I probably deal with, in a serious way, with 20 now.

36:42.636 --> 36:48.303
It's down to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Folger, Chicago, Toronto.

36:48.323 --> 36:50.686
I mean, the big ones.

36:50.706 --> 36:55.753
The ones who are still acquiring rare things.

36:55.793 --> 36:56.734
Yeah.

36:57.457 --> 37:06.588
I mean, I suppose some of them may be still acquiring bits here and there on special subjects, or they may have special funds.

37:06.768 --> 37:11.554
I mean, you know, we may sell to the art smaller library.

37:11.574 --> 37:18.763
A few may have hung on for one reason or another.

37:19.083 --> 37:23.509
But it's certainly not the same kind of business as it was then.

37:23.629 --> 37:26.232
So a young bookseller getting into the market now

37:27.342 --> 37:36.373
He's not going to be focusing on libraries so much anymore because that won't be the center of the business.

37:37.214 --> 37:50.290
Even if the money is available, those libraries are going to be buying from the older, more established dealers like me or Quaritch or whatever, and it would be hard to break into them.

37:50.350 --> 37:53.113
They just don't have the funds to buy everything they want.

37:58.291 --> 38:03.197
Do you think that's still a case?

38:06.602 --> 38:08.885
Not in the same way as it used to be.

38:09.045 --> 38:25.767
And I think that most, I would guess that most university administrators are faced with mounting budgets, and I mean, universities are expensive places to run, are reluctant to allocate

38:26.506 --> 38:33.892
masses of money to the libraries anymore the way they used to.

38:39.577 --> 38:46.243
Certainly not in antiquarian books, because they can see the future is coming.

38:47.163 --> 38:48.184
You can't stop it.

38:48.425 --> 38:52.388
Libraries aren't going to be used the same way they used to be.

38:52.708 --> 38:56.091
They aren't even called the libraries anymore, which is really depressing.

38:56.695 --> 38:59.338
I don't find it depressing.

39:03.944 --> 39:11.273
We're at a period of huge change now, obviously, with the electronic world upon us.

39:11.294 --> 39:19.904
I think we're at a moment now that is not entirely dissimilar to the moment in the middle of the 15th century when printing was invented.

39:19.965 --> 39:25.892
I'm sure there were people like us sitting around saying, what are these inventories?

39:26.125 --> 39:27.247
new things.

39:27.267 --> 39:28.308
It's a movable type.

39:28.328 --> 39:29.270
It's vulgar.

39:31.753 --> 39:37.602
We like our nice old libraries with beautiful illuminated manuscripts in them.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.026
This new stuff is no good.

39:41.227 --> 39:50.080
And yet, 50 years later, the role of manuscripts was... You couldn't stop it now.

39:50.361 --> 39:55.288
And the nature of a library changed quite dramatically.

39:56.399 --> 40:01.449
print allowed libraries to expand dramatically.

40:01.469 --> 40:04.454
Electronics is obviously going to shrink.

40:04.474 --> 40:11.848
There's not going to be, I don't believe in a hundred years there's going to be a physical library except as a museum.

40:15.655 --> 40:19.723
You won't have to go to a library to get information.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.547
We can do that now from our homes.

40:22.567 --> 40:25.752
Yeah, you already can, but it's chaotic now, right?

40:25.792 --> 40:29.477
I mean, you have to know how to hunt the internet or whatever.

40:30.499 --> 40:34.264
But I can't believe that books aren't going to be sort of scanned in.

40:34.324 --> 40:36.086
They'll be huge databases.

40:37.108 --> 40:43.877
If a book comes, a scholarly work comes out, you're not going to have to go into the British Library and sit in the reading room to look at it.

40:44.138 --> 40:45.179
That's ridiculous.

40:46.421 --> 40:50.807
Stanford University Press is actually publishing some of his

40:51.125 --> 40:52.707
on life.

40:52.727 --> 40:54.229
They aren't even going into print.

40:54.249 --> 41:00.497
Well, it's idiotic to print a monograph that 20 people really are going to need.

41:00.517 --> 41:04.582
And it will cost $500 and is basically obsolete the day it comes out.

41:04.662 --> 41:09.028
I mean, don't invest your money in companies printing scholarly journals.

41:09.148 --> 41:11.271
I mean, it's crazy.

41:11.792 --> 41:14.495
I mean, that's a scam that won't exist anymore.

41:14.515 --> 41:18.280
And huge amounts of library money go on those things.

41:18.867 --> 41:32.440
I think that this is going to be a bonanza for universities and that the cost of running a library should be, many of the costs should be eliminated.

41:33.281 --> 41:34.642
It just won't be necessary.

41:34.962 --> 41:45.072
How do you feel about the deaccession of books, physical books?

41:45.633 --> 41:48.115
Personally, I don't have a purist attitude.

41:50.187 --> 41:56.335
I mean, I like the scholarly side of the book world.

41:56.435 --> 41:57.757
I mean, that's my background.

41:57.817 --> 41:58.998
It does interest me.

41:59.018 --> 41:59.939
I hope to know that.

42:00.080 --> 42:05.186
But I also like the sentimental side of collecting.

42:05.206 --> 42:09.071
Collecting is not just a scholarly activity.

42:09.091 --> 42:12.676
There's something about the feel of a book.

42:14.858 --> 42:19.384
Just having a first edition in your hands doesn't mean that

42:21.254 --> 42:25.000
the scholarly life.

42:25.020 --> 42:31.770
So it's nice to have books back in circulation when it allows people to collect them again.

42:31.790 --> 42:39.000
I don't know how much this is going to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if over the next century there's quite a lot of deacquisition.

42:39.802 --> 42:45.911
I mean, all those books I sold to Stonebrook 30 years ago, what do you think they're doing there?

42:46.752 --> 42:47.653
Nothing, right?

42:48.575 --> 42:50.097
Do you think anyone's using them?

42:50.313 --> 42:51.975
in a meaningful way.

42:53.437 --> 42:57.381
Well, if nobody's using them today, does that mean they should get rid of them?

42:58.622 --> 42:59.023
Why not?

42:59.043 --> 43:05.971
I mean, it's a lot easier to travel around now, too, than forgetting the electronic business.

43:06.211 --> 43:19.206
I mean, if you want to see a copy of a book and there's one at Harvard or something, if you actually have to see it physically, as opposed to just reading the text or having it scanned into a database,

43:20.097 --> 43:21.799
Then you can travel to see it.

43:21.819 --> 43:25.462
It's about the heart that you used to travel.

43:25.842 --> 43:27.003
Where were you yesterday?

43:27.123 --> 43:30.006
You were in North America.

43:32.168 --> 43:36.132
When I was a kid, to get here you got on a boat.

43:38.134 --> 43:43.739
You were just beginning to fly, and then my first two trips to Europe were by phone.

43:43.759 --> 43:46.281
It took six days to go see a book.

43:46.882 --> 43:48.383
It was on the other side of the earth.

43:49.392 --> 43:51.416
I mean, it's not going to matter.

43:52.177 --> 44:05.041
And I don't believe that places like Stony Brook will keep stuff like that, except out of inertia, because they're too stupid to focus on it.

44:05.061 --> 44:12.936
When I started in the business, I used to come to England and buy trips every nine months or so.

44:14.502 --> 44:16.504
I had a sort of regular pattern.

44:16.524 --> 44:32.240
I would fly to Scotland, actually, rent a car up in the airport outside of Glasgow, Prestwick, drive into Edinburgh and around there hunting for books, and gradually work my way down to London.

44:32.260 --> 44:34.002
It was sort of a three-week routine.

44:35.464 --> 44:41.070
And that's where a lot of my stock would come from.

44:41.090 --> 44:43.412
In the course of those checks, I would buy

44:43.696 --> 44:49.322
Victorian novels, because it was one of the areas that I was sort of interested in.

44:49.342 --> 44:53.066
These nice three-decker novels that are sort of attractive.

44:53.086 --> 44:57.631
And I could find in a three-week trip, 60, 80, 100 of them.

44:58.913 --> 45:03.938
My limit in those days for a routine novel was six pounds.

45:04.318 --> 45:10.345
I didn't notice as much as I would spend, unless it was somebody paying for Thomas Hardy or George Eliot.

45:12.063 --> 45:18.911
But I would buy all kinds of them in obscure titles, and I could find them.

45:20.353 --> 45:29.243
I'd get them back to New York, and my best customer for them was the University of South Carolina.

45:30.584 --> 45:31.926
I would make a list of them.

45:32.667 --> 45:38.053
They used to cost $25, $30, that kind of range.

45:39.367 --> 45:46.374
I'd send them down a list, and they would buy all the ones they didn't have, which was a fairly healthy percentage of them.

45:47.836 --> 45:55.964
I don't know how many years I did that, but I probably spent them 500 to 1,000 three-deckers.

45:56.585 --> 46:00.929
Well, the University of South Carolina doesn't buy three-deckers anymore.

46:00.949 --> 46:05.374
They haven't done so for 25 years.

46:06.316 --> 46:07.759
They must have them now.

46:07.920 --> 46:12.971
Now the average three-decker of that store is worth a couple hundred pounds, I suppose.

46:14.334 --> 46:18.644
Nobody's looking at them at the University of South Carolina.

46:18.684 --> 46:20.528
They have minor Victorian novels.

46:33.890 --> 46:36.392
took it upon himself to buy Victorian novels.

46:36.532 --> 46:38.114
I mean, you know, you have to buy something.

46:38.134 --> 46:40.716
They had to use up their budgets.

46:40.736 --> 46:47.903
I can't, I don't think it was necessarily anybody doing anything with a great plan or for a very sensible reason.

46:47.983 --> 46:49.404
Maybe it was his hobby.

46:49.464 --> 46:50.245
I don't know.

46:51.286 --> 46:53.728
Expressing his collections in the university.

46:53.828 --> 47:00.734
But those, if I go on a similar three-week trip now, I'm not going to see any three-day novels.

47:00.794 --> 47:01.936
They're off the market.

47:01.956 --> 47:02.496
They're gone.

47:03.286 --> 47:06.309
There are a few around if you go into a jar and dice or something.

47:06.429 --> 47:07.210
I have some.

47:07.751 --> 47:12.876
They still come up occasionally, but not in any quantity.

47:12.976 --> 47:15.218
Well, is there a demand for them among collectors?

47:15.619 --> 47:15.739
Yeah.

47:15.759 --> 47:16.580
There's still a demand.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.761
They're expensive now.

47:18.842 --> 47:27.411
But for a young collector starting out, if he comes in, I'm not going to tell him, why don't you make a comprehensive collection of Victorian three-deckers?

47:28.311 --> 47:29.833
Where are they going to find them?

47:30.826 --> 47:38.598
He could still collect them, but now it's like collecting Elizabethan plays.

47:38.678 --> 47:44.026
You mentioned that you're not going to advise a young collector to do this or that.

47:44.046 --> 47:45.568
Do you work in that area?

47:45.648 --> 47:48.533
Do you develop collections with individuals?

47:49.674 --> 47:52.098
It's sort of a two-sided business for me.

47:52.118 --> 47:53.480
It has been always.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.167
One is my dealing with the university life.

47:59.918 --> 48:05.846
And I have done quite closely with a fair number of them.

48:05.866 --> 48:09.951
And the other side of the business is dealing with private collectors.

48:10.652 --> 48:13.857
And they buy a different kind of book, really.

48:14.197 --> 48:21.607
And you can't sell a Jane Austen first edition to a university library, because they have it.

48:21.627 --> 48:24.711
And Harvard doesn't need a Jane Austen first edition.

48:26.311 --> 48:29.254
That doesn't mean I don't like Jane Austen.

48:29.494 --> 48:32.798
So if I'm going to buy that, that's a different kind of business.

48:32.958 --> 48:38.423
I have to sell it to a collector, or another dealer who's going to sell it to a collector.

48:38.443 --> 48:42.287
But it's essentially aimed at a private collector's world.

48:43.989 --> 48:54.580
Now, there are private collectors who are sophisticated enough or specialized enough that they may share some of the characteristics of a research line.

48:55.522 --> 48:58.366
quite scholarly collectors.

48:58.386 --> 49:08.821
They're somewhere in the middle, but many collectors collect famous books, or books they like, or books they've heard of, or whatever.

49:10.063 --> 49:12.306
And that's a very different kind of business.

49:12.326 --> 49:15.070
So I'm running two businesses at once, and I always have them.

49:15.951 --> 49:22.440
Could you give me an idea, could you give some examples of some tiny collections that you've helped to go?

49:22.460 --> 49:24.583
Yeah, I'll give you a perfect example of them.

49:25.070 --> 49:33.640
It was about 1967 or so, I suppose.

49:34.040 --> 49:45.894
I had a young friend, a woman in New York, who was starting a career as a journalist.

49:46.775 --> 49:53.322
She works at the Times, but she, in those days, was sort of freelance writing articles.

49:54.989 --> 49:57.011
New York Magazine had just started.

49:57.531 --> 50:07.340
And so with my help, she did an article on the rare bookstores of New York.

50:08.621 --> 50:16.628
Naturally, because I was telling her who all the stores were, I got a kind of free paragraph in it.

50:17.849 --> 50:24.895
And it said in it that, among other things, that I was about 20 years younger than most of the other booksellers in New York.

50:25.398 --> 50:28.501
In those days, there weren't young booksellers around.

50:28.541 --> 50:32.105
There was a real age gap in the trade.

50:32.986 --> 50:41.195
I think probably because of the war, World War II actually, it sort of created a gap, both in collectors and dealers.

50:43.378 --> 50:46.922
I was in my 20s.

50:47.002 --> 50:51.827
There were very few other rare booksellers under 50.

50:52.246 --> 50:55.210
Anyway, the article said something like this.

50:57.914 --> 51:07.267
A few months later, a guy came to the office, and I opened the door, and he said, he's clutching New York Magazine.

51:07.327 --> 51:09.951
He said, you know, this says that you're easy to talk to.

51:10.171 --> 51:14.197
I want to know, what is this collecting rare books anyway?

51:14.217 --> 51:17.241
He said, I like to collect things.

51:18.042 --> 51:20.886
I wasn't that busy in those days.

51:21.338 --> 51:23.661
I sat him down, and we started talking.

51:23.681 --> 51:26.705
It turned out he was a dermatologist in New Jersey.

51:26.725 --> 51:33.615
He was not well-educated or anything, but he was a collector by nature.

51:33.635 --> 51:35.077
He did like to collect them.

51:35.097 --> 51:37.280
He collected stamps and anti-lock covers.

51:37.300 --> 51:39.904
He had a full run of Playboy magazine.

51:41.926 --> 51:43.048
But I don't know.

51:43.208 --> 51:49.557
You'd sense that when you meet people like that, either they collect or they don't see the point of it.

51:50.077 --> 51:52.600
The world divides into two kinds of people.

51:53.441 --> 51:57.445
They're either collectors or they're not collectors.

51:59.828 --> 52:05.274
I think if you're in the business, you can sort of spot this difference in about 30 seconds.

52:05.294 --> 52:08.338
Anyway, this guy was a collector.

52:09.759 --> 52:14.405
I think he bought a birthday present for his wife.

52:14.425 --> 52:15.326
That's what happened.

52:15.406 --> 52:17.248
I think that's what he came in for.

52:18.241 --> 52:34.343
He wanted a birthday present for his wife, and I sold him a copy of Byron's Hebrew Melodies for something like 25 bucks, because it had the poem in it, She Walks in Beauty Like the Night.

52:35.845 --> 52:41.493
The fact that his wife was short and fat didn't matter, but this served its purpose.

52:42.695 --> 52:43.376
And he went away.

52:43.396 --> 52:45.719
I didn't see him for a year.

52:45.739 --> 52:46.560
He came back.

52:47.333 --> 52:50.678
his wife's next birthday, and bought another book.

52:50.698 --> 52:52.121
And we sort of got to talking.

52:52.181 --> 52:54.905
It turned out we had a common interest in playing bridge.

52:56.788 --> 52:59.993
And so we started to play duplicate bridge together.

53:01.195 --> 53:04.660
And we became sort of serious bridge players.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.645
We would go play in the summer nationals.

53:07.665 --> 53:09.688
Oh, yeah.

53:09.728 --> 53:14.556
And we got pretty good, actually.

53:15.093 --> 53:18.859
We were doing that, and he kept sort of saying, well, why don't I collect books?

53:18.879 --> 53:23.846
I know he was beginning to make a little more money now as he was working for a drug company.

53:23.926 --> 53:31.457
He wasn't in private practice, but he liked that, and he saw what I was doing in the business, and it sort of appealed to him.

53:32.178 --> 53:34.502
So I said, well, what do you want to collect, Jerry?

53:34.522 --> 53:35.263
He said, I don't know.

53:35.423 --> 53:39.489
I mean, I said, you want to collect dermatology?

53:39.729 --> 53:41.472
He said, no, I don't think.

53:41.975 --> 53:45.900
I said, well, that's good, because I don't know anything about dermatology books in any way.

53:45.940 --> 53:47.262
Most of them are disgusting.

53:47.362 --> 53:49.805
I mean, they show pictures of scabs.

53:51.568 --> 53:52.809
So he said, you choose.

53:52.829 --> 53:54.031
I said, well, okay.

53:56.894 --> 54:01.040
I said, let's... I think I put it this way, probably.

54:01.160 --> 54:11.914
I said, let's collect English poetry of the 19th century, starting with Wordsworth and ending with sort of early Yates.

54:12.704 --> 54:17.731
And more or less what Jerry said was, who's Wordsworth and who's Yates?

54:18.192 --> 54:20.755
I mean, he didn't know anything.

54:20.815 --> 54:23.900
He had gone to pharmacy school or something.

54:24.560 --> 54:27.084
From a very poor family, he worked his way up.

54:27.364 --> 54:37.759
And he was a perfectly nice guy, but not educated in any sense, the academic sense.

54:39.061 --> 54:42.205
But he said, OK, we'll collect that.

54:43.130 --> 54:46.353
You choose the books and I'll pay for them.

54:46.674 --> 54:48.395
And so we started.

54:48.736 --> 54:50.658
I said, how much do you want to spend?

54:50.678 --> 54:54.121
And he said, I think you could spend $1,000 a year.

54:56.744 --> 55:01.469
So I said, okay, and you could buy books.

55:02.770 --> 55:05.373
So we started collecting together.

55:07.035 --> 55:11.239
Well, that collection is still going.

55:11.259 --> 55:11.479
Okay.

55:11.599 --> 55:12.360
Is it still building it?

55:12.779 --> 55:13.901
Yeah.

55:13.921 --> 55:14.501
Yeah.

55:14.622 --> 55:16.604
Do you still like all the choices?

55:16.965 --> 55:19.629
Jerry has never bought a book on his own.

55:20.670 --> 55:27.039
I mean, he now will sometimes suggest things to him if he sees them in a Quaritch catalog.

55:27.600 --> 55:42.381
And I think that you'd have to ask him, but I think that now, after almost 30 years, he has, of his suggestions, I think we've bought

55:43.508 --> 55:46.512
I always say no.

55:46.572 --> 55:48.775
Oh, you reserve the right to veto them.

55:48.795 --> 55:50.337
I veto all of them.

55:50.918 --> 55:54.983
But he now does know who Wordsworth and Pyron is.

55:55.063 --> 56:01.792
I mean, he's not that interested in 19th century poetry, but he still loves collecting.

56:01.812 --> 56:05.196
And the collection is the biggest thing in his life.

56:05.902 --> 56:07.724
No, is this an American collection?

56:07.744 --> 56:08.625
Yeah, it's in New Jersey.

56:08.785 --> 56:11.148
Well, no, he's left his wife now.

56:11.288 --> 56:15.974
He has a little apartment opposite Lincoln Center, and that's where the collection is.

56:16.054 --> 56:19.017
But he's the treasurer of the Keats-Shelley Society.

56:19.078 --> 56:20.379
Is his name anybody I know?

56:20.960 --> 56:21.801
Jerry Wachs.

56:22.421 --> 56:22.842
Wachs?

56:23.102 --> 56:24.404
Yeah, he's in the Grolier.

56:24.944 --> 56:25.986
I'll tell you what you think.

56:27.668 --> 56:32.213
I did a Grolier exhibition of his collection.

56:37.188 --> 56:38.829
the tape on the other side, yeah.
