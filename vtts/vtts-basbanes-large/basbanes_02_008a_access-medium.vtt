00:04.739 --> 00:06.441
Thank you very much, Bob.

00:06.461 --> 00:08.884
That's an extraordinary compliment.

00:09.144 --> 00:15.171
And I think when you write any book at all, you hope, first of all, people will enjoy it.

00:15.211 --> 00:15.812
They'll read it.

00:16.252 --> 00:21.158
But to think that somebody is suggesting that it'll be around 300 years.

00:23.161 --> 00:24.442
I'll take 50 right now.

00:26.925 --> 00:29.548
Bob mentioned that he has a set of the galleys.

00:30.136 --> 00:35.624
The true collectors among you will probably appreciate just how dear these things are.

00:36.345 --> 00:47.160
And in the case of the galleys for this book, there were some substantial changes from the proofs to the first edition of the printed book.

00:47.180 --> 00:51.025
And I think I wrote and I inscribed the copy I gave to Bob.

00:51.045 --> 00:52.728
I said, my first collector.

00:52.808 --> 00:53.529
I couldn't believe it.

00:53.549 --> 00:57.354
I actually had somebody who wanted to collect something that I'd written.

00:57.374 --> 00:58.776
And I was very proud to...

00:59.617 --> 01:07.247
that he was interested in having a copy of that and the fact that he's read it so carefully and so well and has been kind enough to say these nice words.

01:08.290 --> 01:11.194
It's a great, great pleasure for me to come back to Clark.

01:11.434 --> 01:15.499
Actually, to come back, I think Clark is with me all the time.

01:15.579 --> 01:16.920
This is home.

01:18.202 --> 01:24.389
I served as president of the Friends prior to Bob, and I follow Al Southwick, who's here.

01:25.291 --> 01:30.657
And Al wrote a wonderful review of my book in Worcester Magazine a couple weeks ago.

01:31.478 --> 01:36.424
In the C-SPAN interview, which Bob mentions, I quoted...

01:37.484 --> 01:43.377
one of Al's comments, the interviewer, Brian Lamb, asked me if I'm a bibliomaniac.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.944
And I said, you know, people ask me that often.

01:46.964 --> 01:50.211
My stark answer is that I'm on the cusp

01:51.035 --> 02:00.108
But I like the observation that Al Southwick made is Nick Basmaids might not be a bibliomaniac, but he is seriously at risk.

02:00.128 --> 02:02.312
And thank you, Al.

02:02.993 --> 02:07.339
I'm going to use that because I think it does describe the way I feel.

02:08.120 --> 02:12.306
Boy, I really encourage all of you to take a look at these four exhibitions here.

02:13.668 --> 02:18.375
I got here a little early just to enjoy them and to look at them, and I love the way they've been

02:18.355 --> 02:19.176
They've been set up.

02:19.256 --> 02:21.980
I mean, they've been curated by the collectors themselves.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.447
So they aren't these sterile stock kinds of displays.

02:27.487 --> 02:33.214
You see the haphazard nature of the way they've not seemingly haphazard.

02:33.995 --> 02:37.419
And I guess that that kind of defines what a collector is.

02:37.740 --> 02:41.104
It may seem to be haphazard and it may seem to be an accumulation.

02:41.124 --> 02:42.726
But what it really is, it's focused.

02:43.415 --> 02:49.962
It's a focused collection that represents the various interests of the four collectors, who's wonderful.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.505
I mean, really, I'm so impressed.

02:52.565 --> 02:57.611
I was asking Roger Casperson about that beautiful Hemingway first edition.

02:57.872 --> 03:05.020
Mine doesn't even come close to the condition of his copy of that book.

03:05.040 --> 03:11.447
My book is about collectors, I guess, in a very narrow sense, but

03:11.731 --> 03:14.074
you won't learn anything about collecting if you read it.

03:14.234 --> 03:21.923
And the book is 638 pages, and I won't even pretend to try and summarize it for you.

03:21.943 --> 03:30.532
I hope that those of you who have it will read it, dip into it, and enjoy various sections of it.

03:31.313 --> 03:33.756
One thing I'm constantly asked, constantly,

03:34.158 --> 03:48.859
On the few occasions that I've been interviewed for this book, as recently as this morning, however, by a reporter for a Connecticut newspaper, it seems I should be the authority on this subject.

03:49.463 --> 03:54.232
I've written a book about books, a book that is about the passion for books.

03:54.332 --> 03:57.357
I guess it's a celebration of books as much as anything else.

03:57.998 --> 04:04.590
So people usually come to this question, what do I think the future of the book is with this computer generation?

04:04.630 --> 04:07.555
Everybody has a notebook, a small computer.

04:08.697 --> 04:14.087
Of course, I have no idea, but I do feel that whatever shape or form books take,

04:14.708 --> 04:18.192
If it's a computer or if it's a chip, there will always be books.

04:18.212 --> 04:23.138
Books are expressions of creativity, and we've had them for 5,000 years.

04:23.178 --> 04:25.621
When they first appeared, they were clay tablets.

04:26.282 --> 04:30.868
They later became papyrus scrolls from the 3rd century to the 15th century.

04:30.908 --> 04:35.113
They were bound in the same fashion that we see them today, but they were manuscript.

04:35.988 --> 04:44.978
which means they were written by hand, and then we had the invention of movable type, which a lot of collectors in those days thought this was going to be the end of real books.

04:45.158 --> 04:47.801
I mean, how dare they print something that everybody could have?

04:48.262 --> 04:50.124
There would be no more unique copies.

04:50.885 --> 04:52.326
Well, of course, books just flourished.

04:52.466 --> 04:58.513
Whatever shape they take, whatever form they take, there will always be books, and there will always be the passion for them.

04:59.214 --> 05:03.919
I'll tell you a little story about something that happened to me while I was in this

05:04.692 --> 05:10.638
crazy mad rush to get my galleys completed and submitted to my publisher.

05:10.658 --> 05:11.940
This was about April or May.

05:13.301 --> 05:23.432
For reasons that I won't belabor, but I desperately needed to find the 1914 three-volume edition of the catalog of Samuel Pepys's library.

05:24.353 --> 05:32.522
Had to be the 1914 edition, not the 1911, not the 1879, not the 1969, the 1914.

05:32.637 --> 05:41.312
because there's an introduction to Volume 2 regarding the codicils of Pepys's will that I had to verify for bibliographic reasons.

05:42.554 --> 05:43.215
Couldn't find it.

05:43.235 --> 05:49.586
I was working off a Xerox that had been sent to me by the librarian of the Pepys Library at Cambridge University.

05:49.626 --> 05:51.289
Repeated telephone calls.

05:51.790 --> 05:53.473
Dr. Luckett is at lunch.

05:53.593 --> 05:55.236
Dr. Luckett is someplace else.

05:55.537 --> 05:59.241
I'm making these terribly expensive telephone calls to England.

05:59.321 --> 06:01.964
Finally, one morning I was in Boston.

06:02.044 --> 06:04.166
On a whim, I went to the Boston Athenaeum.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.130
To make a long story short, yes, they had the three volumes.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.295
As I was checking them out, they were in immaculate, beautiful condition.

06:13.296 --> 06:16.599
And they don't have computers yet at the Athenaeum, so you sign out your books.

06:18.241 --> 06:18.982
I opened up the book.

06:19.062 --> 06:22.906
I'm the first person to ever check these books out of the Boston Athenaeum.

06:22.946 --> 06:24.868
They've been there since 1914.

06:25.608 --> 06:27.630
It's 1995, 81 years.

06:29.131 --> 06:33.916
I said something really stupid like, gee, I wonder who they bought these books for in the first place.

06:33.936 --> 06:38.080
And this distinguished gentleman signing me out said, we bought them for you, sir.

06:41.784 --> 06:50.873
And, you know, the Athenaeum has been around since 1807.

06:51.595 --> 06:54.658
And I later talked to, I mean, this really struck me.

06:54.698 --> 06:56.760
I mean, the voice was so resonant.

06:56.980 --> 07:20.083
If you read my book, you'll see Sir Robert Cotton and Isaiah Thomas and Jeremy Belknap and Thomas Prince and all these people, all these voices I felt coming down through the ages telling me why some collector or some librarian had seen fit to buy a book that maybe they didn't see any use for, but that somebody down the road, desperate like myself,

07:20.840 --> 07:21.621
would need to have.

07:21.641 --> 07:39.224
And that, I guess, is the future and the meaning of books and what collectors in their own way and libraries, which are collectors in an institutional way, perform, is that they don't just satisfy their passion for these things, is that they do preserve and they pass on.

07:40.365 --> 07:45.632
And I guess that was what I tried to celebrate in this book, which I titled A Gentle Madness.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.138
And I'm pleased to note that this title is kind of taking on a little

07:51.248 --> 07:52.750
a little kind of a cachet of its own.

07:52.770 --> 08:03.046
I was signing books in Washington three weeks ago at the Antiquarian Booksellers Association book fair, these antiquarian book fairs they have.

08:03.908 --> 08:11.239
And on the same day that Colin Powell was signing books out in Virginia, I was signing books in the District of Columbia.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.906
Of course, he signed, I think, something like 2,000 books online.

08:16.072 --> 08:22.018
And I said, I'll never get anybody, but I signed 400, which I'm very... because I had a bunch of ringers.

08:22.058 --> 08:24.500
I had all collectors there.

08:25.261 --> 08:31.607
And they were all there to get the first edition of the book, which I'm pleased to say is a fairly scarce item right now.

08:32.428 --> 08:40.515
The first printing of the book was 6,700 copies, which we thought was good, and it disappeared within two days.

08:41.016 --> 08:43.378
And the second printing...

08:43.561 --> 08:47.066
was ordered the first week of publication, and that was totally on back order.

08:47.086 --> 08:48.448
I'm gloating now, forgive me.

08:48.728 --> 08:57.440
It's amazing because nobody knows what the tastes of the readership is going to be, the audience.

08:57.720 --> 09:04.489
Well, the second printing of, I think it was 11,000, was on full back order by the time it was finished.

09:05.195 --> 09:13.888
And then now the third printing, which brings us up to 35,000 copies in print, is just arriving at bookstores, and that's within six weeks of publication.

09:13.968 --> 09:17.293
So I think I've touched something out there.

09:18.295 --> 09:24.464
And there are more people than you might think, certainly not with this audience.

09:24.484 --> 09:33.818
We're talking with an audience of bibliophiles who really care about books, which is what I hope a gentle madness is all about.

09:34.608 --> 09:38.714
Briefly, the title has a Worcester connection, a Worcester residence.

09:41.037 --> 10:04.210
When Isaiah Thomas, who was the great colonial and federal printer, bookseller, entrepreneur, and founder of the American Aquarian Society, died, his grandson Benjamin Franklin Thomas said in an appreciation, which was later published in the second edition of his History of Printing in North America, that grandfather was afflicted

10:04.814 --> 10:09.782
From the earliest age with that gentlest of infirmities, he was a bibliomaniac.

10:10.483 --> 10:14.490
And I saw that and said, there's my title right there.

10:14.730 --> 10:17.756
And I kind of coined a gentle madness.

10:18.377 --> 10:22.283
It pleased me while I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago.

10:23.022 --> 10:28.233
There was a cocktail party that I went to prior to one of the signings.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.082
And I was there a little early, and I was sitting down with this gentleman I didn't know.

10:33.044 --> 10:38.336
And I asked him if he was a bookseller, because this was a party put together by a bookseller.

10:38.356 --> 10:41.723
He said, no, no, I'm just one of the gently mad.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.873
And boy, I sat up, you know.

10:47.893 --> 10:49.055
I said, really, you know.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.659
I said, I was the one who coined that phrase.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.984
And I said, really, you're Nicholas?

10:55.484 --> 10:56.466
And his name was Nick, too.

10:56.526 --> 10:58.208
He was from Fort Wayne, Indiana.

10:58.228 --> 11:01.894
And he said, I came here to meet you and to buy your book.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.858
So we, and to get, that was kind of nice.

11:05.579 --> 11:08.584
And he's a Mark Twain collector, as it happens.

11:08.604 --> 11:10.967
And we've started a correspondence.

11:11.656 --> 11:19.588
Since the book has been published, it was published in the first week of August, I've received, on average, I would say a letter a day.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.732
I've received a wonderful one.

11:22.092 --> 11:25.237
It's amazing that there are maybe 20,000 copies of the book out there.

11:26.098 --> 11:36.535
And when I think of, I've been writing for newspapers for 30 years, and when I write a column that may get into 25 newspapers, your circulation can be as many as 2 or 3 million.

11:36.555 --> 11:38.157
I mean, mind-boggling numbers.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.060
Never get a letter, you know?

11:40.698 --> 11:53.255
But you write a book, and it's amazing that not only are the letters, do you get letters, number one, but they're so intelligent, and they're from people who are reading the book, finding mistakes.

11:57.521 --> 11:59.203
I see a letter now, I shudder.

11:59.243 --> 12:06.132
It's like my brother, who's an attorney, says he gets a letter from the board of bar overseers, and first, you know, you wipe your brow.

12:06.803 --> 12:08.585
And then you open it up, it's a solicitation.

12:08.665 --> 12:10.848
But I see a letter, I say, what have they found now?

12:12.429 --> 12:20.479
Thankfully, the errors have been minor and have been quietly corrected from printing to printing.

12:20.539 --> 12:24.623
I think there are 10 issue points that distinguish.

12:25.865 --> 12:29.208
For collectors, you'll appreciate what I'm saying here.

12:30.210 --> 12:35.055
Issue points from the second printing to the first printing, and the third printing has

12:35.626 --> 12:42.758
I think four, and when we hopefully get into a fourth edition, there'll be a couple more.

12:43.339 --> 13:00.587
Nothing major, but I nevertheless hate to learn, for instance, that it wasn't Thomas Vaughan who wrote Silex Sintelins in 1623, it was his twin brother Henry, you know, and a professor in New York caught that one.

13:01.006 --> 13:03.690
And the one mention of Thomas, I mean, it's amazing.

13:04.271 --> 13:12.946
I had an 1893 that should be an 18, an 1883 that should be an 1893 typo, hit the wrong number.

13:13.827 --> 13:23.503
I had, you don't want to hear my errors, but anyone, Bob, you can, Bob can verify, Al, you live in, you live in,

13:24.631 --> 13:36.543
fear, terror that somebody's going to really find something that's... But it hasn't so far, thankfully, knock on wood, we haven't had a really embarrassing situation.

13:37.924 --> 13:40.207
Anyway, we talked about the title of the book.

13:41.828 --> 13:42.969
Am I a collector?

13:43.210 --> 13:43.630
Of course.

13:44.311 --> 13:45.232
Do I collect books?

13:45.512 --> 13:51.238
I look at these four collections over here and I say, wow, this stuff is outstanding.

13:51.258 --> 13:54.621
I think one of the points I try to make in my book is that

13:55.613 --> 14:01.560
To have a really wonderful collection, you don't have to have an inexhaustible source of funds.

14:03.142 --> 14:08.109
Book collecting is not synonymous with expensive book collecting.

14:08.169 --> 14:14.196
I mean, you can have a great deal of fun by collecting scarce, unusual, and very cheap things.

14:14.256 --> 14:23.528
I mean, you can find some of my favorite catches or 50-cent things at the Salvation Army bookstore or in antique barns.

14:23.862 --> 14:31.354
And I guess my favorite personal collection is a collection of about 1,500 to 2,000 first editions.

14:32.155 --> 14:41.790
But they're books that were written by authors I've interviewed for the last 19 years, since I've been writing about books for the Telegram and now other newspapers.

14:42.671 --> 14:45.195
And from the very beginning, every time I interviewed an author,

14:46.120 --> 14:52.747
I would ask the man or the woman, whoever, Bill Ferguson, for instance, comes immediately to mind when we talk.

14:52.787 --> 14:53.848
What year was that, Bill?

14:53.928 --> 14:54.249
Freedom?

14:55.771 --> 14:56.391
Well, there you go.

14:56.932 --> 14:57.833
So that's 11 years.

14:57.873 --> 15:00.716
I was already five, six years into the project at that point.

15:00.736 --> 15:04.380
I would always ask the author to write some sort of an inscription.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.323
That collection now is, I've cheated.

15:07.383 --> 15:09.846
See, I've interviewed maybe 900 authors.

15:09.906 --> 15:10.947
How is it that I've got

15:11.146 --> 15:12.227
2,000 books.

15:13.668 --> 15:18.773
Well, if I were doing Joseph Heller on God Knows, well, I'd bring along a Catch-22, you know.

15:19.514 --> 15:26.160
Or if I were doing Arthur Miller on his memoir, Time Bends, I'd bring along Death of a Salesman, so on.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.622
William Kennedy, the whole lot.

15:27.722 --> 15:29.123
Toni Morrison, the whole lot.

15:29.904 --> 15:36.530
So you don't just only have that one inscribed book of the one you're doing the story on, you have the others.

15:37.191 --> 15:40.714
And so it's now about 1,500, 2,000 volumes.

15:41.251 --> 15:44.574
But when you think about it, what does this collection actually cost me in terms of money?

15:45.315 --> 15:45.615
Nothing.

15:46.897 --> 15:47.617
Not even a nickel.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.320
Not counting the books that I've added to it.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.243
But the central collection is review books.

15:53.543 --> 15:58.809
Books that have been sent to me by publishers with the hope and the expectation that I'll write something about it.

15:59.830 --> 16:02.473
And on those occasions that I do, I'll have them sign it.

16:03.053 --> 16:03.974
And so what's the value?

16:04.034 --> 16:05.215
Is the value monetary?

16:05.335 --> 16:06.096
I have no idea.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.840
Some of them, I suppose, the Ansel Adams book would have some value.

16:10.748 --> 16:17.899
But the value is personal, and I think that's what these four collections write out here.

16:17.959 --> 16:28.956
I have no doubt that a number of the items in there are very valuable books, which certainly command wonderful prices if they were ever put up at auction.

16:29.036 --> 16:38.511
But the value to their owners, I know, is personal, and that's, I guess, what book collecting is really all about.

16:38.997 --> 16:44.808
We've talked about value of my prepared text here.

16:46.030 --> 16:49.096
The book, of course, as Bob mentioned, is divided into two parts.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.939
Bob read the second part first.

16:53.123 --> 16:58.373
A lot of people are doing that, and it really is two books as envisioned.

16:59.382 --> 17:08.035
Originally, when I first made the proposal to write this book back in 1987 or so, I envisioned just a history.

17:08.896 --> 17:19.573
And I guess this started from a piece I did about the Antiquarian Society, again, on their 175th anniversary back in 87, and pretty nicely received.

17:20.154 --> 17:28.326
And I thought I'd just do a history of this passion and how this passion has been channeled into the preservation of books, manuscripts of knowledge.

17:28.930 --> 17:34.545
And a publisher liked the idea, signed a contract.

17:34.565 --> 17:39.157
But as it developed, the journalist in me said, well, these stories are wonderful.

17:39.177 --> 17:39.799
They're history.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.624
But what's going on right now?

17:41.664 --> 17:45.133
And that really became part two, which

17:45.670 --> 17:49.156
which is of the 638 pages, it's probably, what, 400?

17:50.157 --> 17:59.472
I don't know how many, maybe two-thirds of the book, are these wonderful stories that just happen to break more or less on my watch.

17:59.632 --> 18:08.286
I mean, who could predict a year and a half into the writing of this book that Stephen Blumberg, this book thief, would get arrested and

18:09.413 --> 18:30.441
And they would find in his house in Ottumwa, Iowa, 24,000 rare books, all of them stolen from 368 colleges and universities throughout the United States, a value initially estimated to be as high as $20 million, but more realistically $7 million, which is not bad.

18:31.482 --> 18:33.565
What made him very interesting to me...

18:34.878 --> 18:40.044
We've been talking all along about the productive aspects of bibliomania, bibliophilia.

18:40.945 --> 18:45.309
Well, here's the perfect example of what happens when a collector falls over the cliff.

18:45.329 --> 18:47.752
It totally loses it.

18:49.234 --> 18:53.659
These are the consequences, I guess, of uncontrolled, unchecked bibliomania.

18:53.679 --> 18:55.300
Beyond that, he was a wonderful story.

18:56.582 --> 18:57.783
And so I went to his trial.

18:58.324 --> 19:02.168
Spent two weeks in Iowa in one of the coldest winters they've ever had.

19:02.823 --> 19:04.965
Got to know him, spent a day with him.

19:05.025 --> 19:13.273
He was out on bail while they were still waiting for the verdict to come down.

19:15.074 --> 19:20.079
What happened in his case, of course, these are the consequences of what I call criminal bibliomania.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.363
He wasn't really charged with stealing these books because it was a federal crime.

19:24.383 --> 19:29.888
He was charged with transporting stolen property across state lines into Iowa.

19:29.908 --> 19:32.290
But to prove that, they had to prove that the books were stolen.

19:32.843 --> 19:40.071
But his defense, unique, no other instance of it in the history of American jurisprudence, was insanity.

19:41.273 --> 19:52.286
Now, you have a book called The Gentle Madness, and you have a guy who's stealing books valued at $7 million, and his defense is insanity.

19:52.306 --> 19:53.768
And it wasn't a frivolous defense.

19:53.808 --> 19:57.552
I mean, if I were on the jury, I would have accepted it, I think.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.781
He had a history.

19:59.861 --> 20:02.725
I mean, he had 20-year history of read the book.

20:02.785 --> 20:11.437
I mean, I did manage to get access to his psychiatric records, and his father had power of attorney and allowed me to examine them.

20:12.638 --> 20:23.353
I got a letter from Steven from prison after he got a chance to read the book, and he said, as painful as it is to rehash those days, I find on balance it's a very

20:24.042 --> 20:29.307
a very fair evaluation of what happened, but then he used an expletive.

20:30.588 --> 20:38.115
He said, but that tells you how sacred your thoughts are, the thoughts are that you share with the psychiatrist.

20:38.135 --> 20:52.648
He had no idea that his very valid complaint, you know, he had no idea that some of these records that he had, some of these statements that he had shared with the psychoanalyst had been turned over to me, but...

20:52.983 --> 20:56.127
I hope that they served a useful purpose in the book.

20:57.249 --> 20:59.292
Stephen was a thief.

20:59.973 --> 21:04.559
He had committed, by his own estimation, perhaps 10,000 felonies in his life.

21:06.081 --> 21:07.764
But was he just a thief?

21:07.824 --> 21:12.971
If he were just a thief, then he wouldn't really be of that much interest to me.

21:13.011 --> 21:19.260
I mean, there have been other book thieves, certainly not nearly as spectacular as Stephen...

21:20.067 --> 21:23.011
But what made him very interesting to me is that he stole these books to keep them.

21:23.111 --> 21:24.272
He loved them.

21:24.512 --> 21:25.974
There was no greed involved.

21:26.014 --> 21:27.056
He didn't steal them.

21:27.076 --> 21:32.542
Not that this mitigates the crime in any way, but he was a collector.

21:32.622 --> 21:34.725
I call that chapter the Blumberg Collection.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.247
And it was very focused.

21:37.228 --> 21:40.292
Any number of people who went and looked at it said, it's a beautiful collection.

21:40.372 --> 21:42.494
It's the provenance that we question.

21:45.518 --> 21:48.221
One fellow said, well, I don't much care for ex-libris books.

21:49.123 --> 21:49.483
But...

21:50.375 --> 21:51.918
Other than that, they're wonderful.

21:53.041 --> 21:55.647
He took out all of the book plates.

21:56.549 --> 22:01.440
So it made it very hard to figure out where these books all came from.

22:02.382 --> 22:05.228
But what he also did is he had some albums.

22:05.731 --> 22:07.733
And this became a collection within the collection.

22:07.753 --> 22:13.460
He put all these book plates from all the various places that he stole books into these albums.

22:13.860 --> 22:20.608
And so when they finally caught up with him and they started examining these book plates, they had an idea of where to start.

22:20.988 --> 22:23.571
But still, which book plates belong to which books?

22:24.753 --> 22:33.763
And while we were driving down to Ottumwa that day during the middle of the trial, he was kind of holding out as what he thought might be a bargaining chip

22:34.520 --> 22:40.545
that might help him negotiate a lesser sentence was that he knew where every book came from.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.788
So he said to me, turn off your tape recorder.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.209
I turned it off.

22:45.070 --> 22:47.992
And he said, you know the Uncle Tom's cabin they think I got from Harvard?

22:48.853 --> 22:50.094
He said, I got it from USC.

22:52.636 --> 22:53.537
And it was.

22:55.739 --> 23:03.126
But that chip, like every other, it lost its currency because they had a whole team of bibliographers who

23:03.629 --> 23:04.292
worked on the books.

23:04.332 --> 23:07.946
It was amazing how they determined where the books came from.

23:09.131 --> 23:13.167
Because up until the time of his arrest, and he had been stealing for a 20-year period,

23:13.838 --> 23:15.000
all over the United States.

23:15.080 --> 23:22.070
It was 40, 45 states, two Canadian provinces in the District of Columbia that he stole books from.

23:22.471 --> 23:24.093
And he was really out for the record.

23:24.113 --> 23:28.740
He hadn't been to Hawaii or Alaska yet, and there were certain places way up north that he didn't like the cold.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.287
But he would have gotten there sooner or later, I'm sure.

23:36.051 --> 23:40.538
But he had this idea of putting together a marvelous collection of Americana,

23:41.125 --> 23:42.186
that would document.

23:42.747 --> 23:50.877
He said, by the way, that he was tempted by the American Antiquarian Society, but he never thought he would be able to get in there.

23:50.917 --> 23:52.059
Their security was good.

23:52.079 --> 23:53.180
I told Marcus that.

23:53.721 --> 23:59.828
Marcus was very pleased that he was on the list, but he was never able to get in.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.873
One of the ways that they determined ownership was interesting.

24:04.154 --> 24:06.036
Harvard, for instance, uses a

24:06.421 --> 24:11.487
a certain kind of tape that they could identify for repairing books.

24:11.507 --> 24:17.553
So they're able to identify certain books as belonging to Harvard by the tape, or there were watermarks.

24:17.693 --> 24:19.836
But it was an extraordinary job.

24:19.856 --> 24:23.460
There were 24,000 books.

24:23.480 --> 24:30.167
Among the treasures that he had was the state of Connecticut's own copy of the first

24:30.485 --> 24:31.807
book printed in Connecticut.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.869
He stole that from the state of Connecticut Library.

24:34.550 --> 24:35.972
He also collected doorknobs.

24:39.196 --> 24:43.501
He gave me one, as a matter of fact, as a memento of our day together.

24:43.521 --> 24:44.502
He had a warehouse.

24:45.503 --> 24:46.925
Oh, this guy is unbelievable.

24:47.706 --> 24:49.648
He had a warehouse in downtown Ottumwa.

24:49.688 --> 24:52.712
He had, it is estimated, perhaps eight other

24:53.097 --> 24:54.959
warehouses throughout the United States.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.964
He had 50,000 antique doorknobs.

24:59.765 --> 25:03.990
He had 120,078 RPM records.

25:05.131 --> 25:08.636
He had perhaps as many as 30,000 stained glass windows.

25:08.676 --> 25:13.782
Now these are the stained glass windows of these old Victorian houses that had been condemned.

25:13.802 --> 25:17.286
He started doing collecting things when he was 12 or 13.

25:17.726 --> 25:22.412
He had been treated, you know, he had legitimate emotional

25:22.578 --> 25:24.382
psychiatric problems.

25:25.424 --> 25:36.127
But he had this fascination for the Victorian period, and the book collection started more or less as a reference library to document some of the things that he was interested in.

25:36.729 --> 25:38.492
And then it went off on its own.

25:38.552 --> 25:41.599
I said, well, how does that explain the 100 incunables that you have?

25:42.220 --> 25:49.714
I mean, incunables are books that were printed from 1450 or so up until 1500, the first printed books.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.959
Incunable means from the cradle.

25:52.019 --> 25:54.724
It's the cradle period of printing.

25:55.385 --> 26:02.018
So if he's only interested in Americana, what is he doing with books that were printed before the discovery of America, you know?

26:02.707 --> 26:05.531
And he said, well, that became, he said, yeah, that's a good point.

26:05.611 --> 26:08.916
He said, but I really became interested in printing itself.

26:09.056 --> 26:13.021
And he said, 100 incunables at this stage of the 20th century.

26:13.041 --> 26:15.725
He said, not bad, not a bad achievement.

26:15.745 --> 26:17.587
And he was very impressed.

26:18.809 --> 26:26.920
He was so upset because when the books were seized, they brought them to a, if I'm going too long on Bloomberg, stop me, by the way.

26:27.802 --> 26:28.883
He does seem to be the,

26:29.690 --> 26:32.654
the character in the book that people are most interested in.

26:35.057 --> 26:36.759
But where was I going, Bob?

26:37.119 --> 26:41.004
I sometimes get going on these... I'm sorry, what?

26:41.064 --> 26:44.348
When they were seized.

26:44.368 --> 26:45.209
When they were seized.

26:46.551 --> 26:47.432
Thank you.

26:47.452 --> 26:51.117
They brought the books to a warehouse in Omaha, Nebraska.

26:51.137 --> 26:52.078
A secret warehouse.

26:52.158 --> 26:53.159
Nobody knew where it was.

26:54.201 --> 26:55.242
The FBI took me.

26:55.282 --> 26:58.566
They didn't blindfold me, but they did drive me around in circles.

26:58.968 --> 27:01.952
And it was this nondescript warehouse.

27:01.972 --> 27:04.696
And the agent in charge said, I don't know what you want to come out here for.

27:04.716 --> 27:06.018
All you're going to see is old books.

27:06.779 --> 27:12.007
I said, you know... He said, it looks just like a library.

27:12.127 --> 27:16.873
I said, well, that's... I said, that's the idea.

27:16.893 --> 27:21.140
I described this in the early pages of that chapter.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.303
Yeah, I went and it looked just like a library.

27:23.403 --> 27:24.604
Beautiful bindings.

27:24.705 --> 27:26.427
He had a wonderful collection of...

27:26.896 --> 27:31.962
18th century American bindings, these incunables that we mentioned, all sorts of things.

27:32.002 --> 27:51.864
But what struck me were these little signs that they had on the shelves, corrugated metal shelving, and the signs were Harvard, UCLA, Wisconsin Historical Society, all these different institutions that they had identified as the places that he had stolen from.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.688
And he had said to me later that,

27:56.528 --> 27:58.833
He said, they messed up my whole cataloging scheme.

27:58.994 --> 28:02.883
I mean, yeah, he said, he said, when I had them in a tumour, I had them all by subject matter.

28:02.903 --> 28:06.531
He had his favorite room in the house was the California room.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.736
And I have pictures for those of you who have the book.

28:09.378 --> 28:10.701
I took some pictures of him.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.149
And these are the only pictures I'm pleased to say that that.

28:14.517 --> 28:22.544
other than his mug shot that has been shot since his arrest, he's posing very happily in front of some empty shells in the California Room.

28:23.085 --> 28:29.150
And that was named the California Room because that was where he did what he felt were his best pickings.

28:30.231 --> 28:31.812
Claremont College, USC.

28:32.373 --> 28:33.534
He climbed up elevator.

28:33.554 --> 28:38.919
And how he got into, I mean, the way he did these thefts is beyond belief.

28:38.939 --> 28:40.540
He would climb up elevator shafts.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.481
He was a locksmith.

28:41.501 --> 28:42.482
He would make keys.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.993
He once managed to get an ID card of a professor.

28:47.793 --> 28:51.897
So he assumed, and then he told me, well, I'm very good at things.

28:52.638 --> 29:00.205
So he constructed a whole new identity for himself around this professor, Matthew Magoo was his name.

29:01.066 --> 29:10.815
And he had a driver's license with his own picture, totally authentic driver's license, social security card, faculty ID.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.126
And now he was able to elevate the level of his collecting.

29:14.146 --> 29:27.822
Before he could just get into the general stacks, now as a visiting professor, Professor Magoo, with his briefcase filled with, pardon me, burglary tools, he was now able to get into the special collections areas.

29:27.902 --> 29:31.366
And he would steal keys, he'd take them out, make copies, come back at night.

29:31.406 --> 29:32.888
He knew how to get around...

29:33.458 --> 29:34.881
security systems.

29:34.921 --> 29:42.535
I mean, a couple of mafia guys talked to him, and they said, what are you fooling around with books for, you know?

29:43.136 --> 29:46.823
With your talent, you know, you could be... And they said, well, you don't understand.

29:46.863 --> 29:49.888
He said, I didn't steal the... I didn't take the books to sell them.

29:49.908 --> 29:51.712
I took them to keep them.

29:51.772 --> 29:55.058
And he said, when I told them that, they decided I really was crazy.

29:56.059 --> 29:56.901
And...

29:57.505 --> 29:59.229
So he is still in prison, by the way.

29:59.269 --> 30:00.512
They gave him seven years.

30:00.552 --> 30:02.616
His insanity defense didn't hold up.

30:04.079 --> 30:11.616
They took about 15 minutes to convict, and he is going to be released in February.

30:13.115 --> 30:35.126
And so many, in fact, I've been invited, this is true, to participate in a symposium put together by the Smithsonian Institution, and it's in February, and it's for security directors at museums and libraries that are coming from all, and they want me to talk about Blumberg, and they are really concerned what's going to happen when Blumberg gets out.

30:36.588 --> 30:39.612
And I said, don't worry, there's only one Stephen Blumberg, and

30:39.878 --> 30:43.527
The real people you have to worry about are the

30:43.810 --> 30:48.375
the people who really have legitimate access to get inside.

30:48.415 --> 30:58.505
I tell one story in that Bloomberg chapter about this fellow down in Georgia, a guy by the name of Skeet Willingham, who was the curator, the librarian there of rare books.

30:58.645 --> 31:04.571
And he stole virtually all of the Confederate imprints and destroyed the records.

31:04.752 --> 31:08.415
So there was no way of knowing what they had and sold them.

31:08.476 --> 31:10.518
So, I mean, this is a question of pure greed.

31:10.658 --> 31:10.898
I mean,

31:11.350 --> 31:24.224
If there's a balance of who's more evil, I mean, they're both thieves, but Willingham only served like a year and a half, and I find his crime far more reprehensible than Blumberg's, as heinous as it is.

31:25.025 --> 31:29.931
I mean, the guy is, I think, clearly sick and requires some form of treatment.

31:30.051 --> 31:36.037
And in the end, you know, how can you really despise somebody who loves books as much as he did?

31:36.898 --> 31:40.362
And...

31:42.299 --> 31:44.662
Well, he's only one chapter out of 14.

31:44.682 --> 31:54.554
I think, in my own view, it's the chapter that everybody is kind of interested in because it was a national story when it broke.

31:55.675 --> 31:57.017
There was some press attention.

31:58.078 --> 32:05.387
Thankfully, from my standpoint, I was the only journalist from outside of Iowa at the trial, so I kind of had a clear field.

32:06.008 --> 32:20.516
It happened that the week that trial went on was the same week that Operation Desert Storm started, and the press was more interested in the bombing in the Gulf than they were in books in Iowa.

32:20.536 --> 32:22.279
It worked out to my advantage.

32:22.951 --> 32:23.893
But that's one case.

32:23.953 --> 32:26.116
That's the aberrational case.

32:26.437 --> 32:42.124
I like to think that the William Scheide's of the world, and Mr. Scheide, who is considered to own the finest private book collection in the world, and when he allowed me to handle his Gutenberg Bible, and I felt lightheaded,

32:42.560 --> 32:46.284
I think that's really what the book is more properly about.

32:46.885 --> 32:55.294
Or Carter Burden, who has this extraordinary collection of 70,000 modern first editions, American first editions.

32:56.296 --> 33:07.268
Or Chef Zathmary from Chicago, who acquired 250,000 culinary objects, which he has since given to Johnson and Wales, the University of Chicago.

33:07.855 --> 33:14.154
University of Iowa, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, given just to further scholarship.

33:14.595 --> 33:18.507
And I think you'll find that wherever you go in the United States,

33:19.027 --> 33:32.427
that there's always a collector or a group of collectors who at some point have given whatever library it may be, its focus, the finest books that they have, and they may be quirky.

33:32.847 --> 33:42.942
You know, you have the Arendt's Tobacco Collection at the New York Public Library put together by one of the owners of the American Tobacco Company, but they have 250,000 items.

33:43.782 --> 33:46.185
and very, very worthwhile things.

33:47.627 --> 34:01.365
So the second half of the book is the journalism, the front half is the history, and I'm sorry I talked so long about Mr. Blumberg, but I'd be pleased to answer any questions anybody might have.

34:03.768 --> 34:09.115
I hope, Robert, you said you had a dozen, so come on, you're the ringer in the audience.

34:12.453 --> 34:13.434
my own adventures.

34:14.615 --> 34:20.682
I don't consider, I thought I was a serious collector up until the day I started this book.

34:20.702 --> 34:29.152
And then when I really saw what some of these people have, I kind of lost my steam, you know.

34:29.172 --> 34:31.875
I love my modern first editions.

34:31.975 --> 34:32.976
I love my signed books.

34:33.076 --> 34:34.478
I love my books on

34:35.116 --> 35:00.415
bibliography and the history of collecting and library formation, but when you see some of these collections of William Self, the Hollywood producer who gives you his copy of, allows me you to hold his copy of Tamerlane, he has 22 inscribed copies of Dickens, one book that Dickens gave to Hans Christian Andersen.

35:00.479 --> 35:03.723
And it's inscribed, and you're holding this.

35:03.964 --> 35:05.666
And I think that's part of collecting.

35:06.968 --> 35:11.393
Every collector, every bibliophile will admit that there is something tactile.

35:11.433 --> 35:12.275
You really feel it.

35:13.056 --> 35:16.440
Something really goes up your arms and you get dizzy.

35:17.862 --> 35:19.144
I've seen Bob faint.

35:22.408 --> 35:25.592
When he sees a particularly beautiful bird illustration, I mean...

35:25.943 --> 35:27.685
That was at the price, though.

35:27.705 --> 35:28.106
Whatever.

35:31.631 --> 35:32.752
So, yes, sir?

35:36.638 --> 35:38.400
What happens to these collections when they die?

35:38.420 --> 35:38.801
Where do they go?

35:38.821 --> 35:47.633
Well, my first paragraph of the book, it's the defining moment, you know, in the life of every collector comes this moment.

35:48.474 --> 35:55.444
Regardless of how great or how small the collection is, there comes a point where the books have to pass...

35:55.897 --> 36:09.559
And as I've indicated, and perhaps not well enough, that so many of the great, great libraries in this country have been given books by, I mean, look at the Morgan Library.

36:09.579 --> 36:11.202
That's one collector in New York.

36:11.222 --> 36:16.150
Look at the American Antiquarian Society, which started as the collection of Isaiah Thomas.

36:16.703 --> 36:19.846
the Huntington Library in California.

36:19.866 --> 36:29.176
I mean, everywhere you go, the New York Public Library is just a collection of great collections for maybe a hundred different people who have put together these collections.

36:29.536 --> 36:33.701
Now, all collections shouldn't go to institutions because that would take the fun out of collecting.

36:33.721 --> 36:40.748
You have to leave stuff for the next... The greatest American collection ever is said to be Robert Hole III.

36:41.729 --> 36:42.630
He died in 1909.

36:42.990 --> 36:44.652
My chapter 5

36:45.307 --> 36:56.819
which I call Brandy for Heroes, and I won't get into how it came by that title, but that starts with the wholesale in 1911, and why did he not give these books to some library?

36:56.839 --> 37:00.983
He said, well, if other people didn't sell their books, where would I have gotten mine?

37:01.264 --> 37:07.030
And he felt an obligation, and he had two Gutenberg Bibles, one on vellum, one on paper.

37:07.791 --> 37:12.435
It was a remarkable sale that went on for two years.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.858
In fact, Harry Widener was on his way back from

37:15.833 --> 37:23.768
England just to attend one of the wholesales when he went down on the Titanic, which I described in the book.

37:24.509 --> 37:27.595
And he helps his mother on board lifeboat number four.

37:27.675 --> 37:29.178
He said, mother, I have the bacon.

37:29.218 --> 37:30.440
The bacon goes with me.

37:30.460 --> 37:35.409
And he had a little volume of Bacon's essays, which he had purchased in England.

37:35.449 --> 37:37.333
And those are the old days.

37:37.393 --> 37:39.597
My wife said, you know, how many of these guys would...

37:40.370 --> 37:45.658
would help their mothers and their wives on the boats, you know, they'd probably jump on it.

37:45.678 --> 37:49.624
I mean, that was the day of gentlemen.

37:50.165 --> 38:01.401
And he went down with his father on the Titanic, and the result, of course, is the great Widener Library at Harvard University, which is really a monument to a collector.

38:01.461 --> 38:05.888
I don't know if that answers the question, but some people sell them.

38:05.986 --> 38:07.308
Other people pass them on.

38:07.388 --> 38:14.340
But the books, what matters is that the books go on and that there's some place for another collector or for an institution.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.572
Nick, this book is on the way.

38:21.592 --> 38:22.033
What's your name?

38:22.053 --> 38:27.522
Still, happily, my publisher is asking the same question, and that's the real...

38:27.907 --> 38:38.297
I say the hardest thing in the world is to sell your first book, and I can attest to that, and that it's now out and exceeding their expectations.

38:40.339 --> 38:49.928
They want to know what's next, and I don't know, but I'd like to think that I'm not done with books yet, and I don't want to do more of the same.

38:49.988 --> 38:57.475
I'd like to do some stories about European collecting and focus really on the 20th century, but we'll see.

38:57.455 --> 38:59.112
We'll see if there's interest in it.
