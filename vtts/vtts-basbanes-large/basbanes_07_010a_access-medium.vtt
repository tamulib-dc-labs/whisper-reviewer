00:03.338 --> 00:09.467
to Dr. Haskell Norman in San Francisco on 14 June, 1991.

00:10.629 --> 00:19.441
And you started, Doctor, by saying, by commenting on the phrase, the concept of bibliomania.

00:19.922 --> 00:31.759
Yes, what I was trying to call your attention was there is no equivalent terminology to my recollection that applies to any other form of

00:32.482 --> 00:36.006
collecting or accumulation of objects.

00:36.247 --> 00:41.433
And I haven't studied it that carefully, but I don't recall any.

00:41.453 --> 00:52.847
And I've always been interested in the fact that the pathology, the term, you know, maybe applies primarily to people who, in some ways, collect books.

00:52.867 --> 01:02.218
Now, obviously, the term that has historical origin and may, in some instances, may be justified

01:02.401 --> 01:25.694
But the obvious term, just like any other mania, it applies an exaggerated form of meditation rather than a more, shall we say, normal form of meditation.

01:25.714 --> 01:27.356
But after all, what do you do with a term hobby or adaptation?

01:27.376 --> 01:31.041
One thinks of hobbies, one thinks that's a perfectly acceptable term in our society.

01:31.561 --> 01:56.654
And I think that one has to differentiate between something that may be an allocation from something that becomes, if you will, an obsession, are viewed as madness.

01:56.674 --> 01:58.075
And I think this is where the civil line has to be drawn, I would say.

01:58.095 --> 01:59.357
That's my response to your title of your book.

01:59.692 --> 02:14.306
Let's make clear that when I was thinking of a title, it wasn't because I planned to write about the—and I'm putting quotation marks around the word—madness or the mania.

02:14.406 --> 02:29.040
But again, it goes back to the Isaiah Thomas— Right, but you see, when you read the public in general, you're emphasizing one aspect of it which I think—now, after all, I know some of the people that

02:29.830 --> 02:31.432
you've interviewed.

02:31.452 --> 02:37.881
I mean, I know them well, but I would hesitate to say that they're mad.

02:37.901 --> 02:43.589
I believe... Well, when Steven Blumberg was arrested out in Iowa... Steven Blumberg's an exception.

02:43.609 --> 02:45.772
Okay, and I've interviewed him, by the way.

02:46.373 --> 02:50.239
I've interviewed him.

02:50.259 --> 02:52.041
When he was arrested, they said,

02:52.190 --> 02:54.373
well, this man is a bibliomaniac.

02:54.473 --> 02:55.815
That's true.

02:55.835 --> 02:57.317
Maybe in his case it's true.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.720
And maybe in his case it's true.

02:59.740 --> 03:12.798
And I feel, you see, one theme I hope to explore in my book is how the book collector has provided a function of helping to preserve the artifacts of human achievement.

03:12.818 --> 03:13.579
Oh, of course.

03:13.619 --> 03:16.763
But that's no different than the art collector or others.

03:17.148 --> 03:21.635
Well, but a work of art is a unique work in many cases.

03:22.276 --> 03:29.267
Books are printed and have always been the poor cousin to the works of art.

03:29.807 --> 03:33.353
So many things have been considered ephemeral or worthless.

03:33.473 --> 03:37.760
It depends on whether you're collecting prints or painting.

03:38.220 --> 03:45.872
If you're collecting prints, you're closer to the category of books because once you get into a series of, say,

03:46.325 --> 03:58.864
200 of Chagall's lithographs, you're not so far from a book that's limited edition.

03:59.004 --> 04:13.525
So I think it may be true it's a poor cousin in the sense that economically in our market books don't claim the same kind of money as the New York Times article.

04:13.746 --> 04:13.986
I think

04:14.725 --> 04:26.239
I think the difference, of course, is the visual accessibility of what a book is and what a painting is.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.963
I think, you know, people can look at it.

04:28.983 --> 04:38.435
You can't really display your library as well as you can if you had to do it in a great painting.

04:38.455 --> 04:41.138
So there's a difference in terms of, on the other hand, I presume you can't display

04:41.489 --> 04:53.664
Well, in his case, I'm using him as the example of a collector.

04:54.384 --> 04:58.329
Was he also a businessman?

04:58.629 --> 05:02.534
Did he sell some of the stuff?

05:02.734 --> 05:04.116
Not the books.

05:04.236 --> 05:06.919
No, we don't know for sure.

05:07.961 --> 05:10.804
That was a later development book.

05:11.071 --> 05:12.753
Well, I've covered it pretty carefully.

05:12.813 --> 05:17.938
In fact, I'm the only journalist who's interviewed him, and we've actually corresponded even since he's been incarcerated.

05:18.199 --> 05:18.839
Is he in jail?

05:19.260 --> 05:22.403
Well, he's awaiting sentencing, but he's being held without blood.

05:22.463 --> 05:32.454
Well, I think that, I think, obviously, that anybody that steals something is going to get some fat again.

05:32.474 --> 05:32.774
Wouldn't you?

05:32.794 --> 05:38.040
It isn't, like, you can't just call him mad, necessarily, because not all mad people steal.

05:38.645 --> 05:47.355
But what makes another aspect that makes him very interesting to me is the fact that there's focus in his book collection.

05:47.536 --> 05:51.220
It wasn't a haphazard gathering of Americana.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.824
I thought he had a Nuremberg Chronicle.

05:54.944 --> 05:58.789
Well, but you can justify the Nuremberg Chronicle.

05:58.989 --> 06:01.712
You can justify anything.

06:01.732 --> 06:05.597
Well, because it's the last great history

06:06.083 --> 06:11.990
It's the last great history published that fails to mention the discovery of North America.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.271
It was published in 1493.

06:13.952 --> 06:21.620
So if you have a serious Americana collection that has place in it— I'm not going to—it's not necessary to take issue on that.

06:21.640 --> 06:32.833
But the main thing I have—the main point I'm trying to get to is I think that the motivation is so different in your interest in motivation.

06:33.337 --> 06:35.580
Are there any number of us?

06:36.220 --> 06:43.488
I don't think one can just start and generalize and you really feel as individuals.

06:43.509 --> 06:47.513
I know I've talked to other people who collect them.

06:47.533 --> 06:53.640
You don't learn anything about significant things about the motivation really on an ordinary encounter.

06:53.780 --> 06:59.867
You learn only if you have a chance to study carefully what's going on in the person's life.

07:00.742 --> 07:10.577
I think it's a little hazardous to try and make too many general motivations without the motivations.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.300
Because after all, you know, why does one collect books, for example?

07:12.320 --> 07:18.109
Assuming you have the means to collect, why would you collect books rather than something else?

07:18.129 --> 07:20.433
That's a good question to begin with.

07:20.453 --> 07:24.960
Now, some people who are wealthy enough can collect more than one thing.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.086
I know one collector I had occasion to visit at a great library.

07:30.106 --> 07:31.108
His wife collected great paintings.

07:32.189 --> 07:42.263
So between the two of them, they covered two important areas of collections.

07:42.283 --> 07:43.365
And so it was interesting.

07:43.505 --> 07:50.535
Now, he happened to have scientific background, so there was a little bit more of a motivation on his part.

07:50.575 --> 07:51.336
Now, I never did know.

07:51.552 --> 07:54.675
was that motivated his wife.

07:54.775 --> 08:02.483
I didn't know either enough well that I'm just mentioning.

08:02.503 --> 08:04.205
If you ask yourself a question, you can start with that.

08:04.325 --> 08:08.189
Just like you can ask yourself a question while you're interested in something.

08:08.269 --> 08:13.915
Have you ever resolved for yourself why some people collect books as opposed to paintings?

08:14.015 --> 08:17.138
No, not really because how can you

08:17.236 --> 08:27.808
I think most people that collect books have a certain intellectual curiosity, I think, about books, period, and what books represent to them.

08:27.828 --> 08:42.805
After all, I think we all start to use books to read from, and depending on what the acquisition of knowledge means to people, I think books become important to some people more than others, why they become

08:43.392 --> 08:50.641
Utilizes objects rather than sources of knowledge is a difficult another question.

08:50.661 --> 08:57.290
But I think most people, for example, almost any scholar you'll encounter has something of a library.

08:58.251 --> 09:05.420
If nothing else, he has borrowed from the university rows of books in his office.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.087
So there are sources of information which scholars lean on.

09:11.995 --> 09:15.439
Do you have a difference between them?

09:15.539 --> 09:18.323
I don't believe we have a difference between them.

09:18.343 --> 09:19.945
No, but there's some reason I say that.

09:19.965 --> 09:23.849
I think it all starts with a certain amount of no.

09:24.810 --> 09:40.129
I think the transition between collecting books as objects and collecting books for information is one of the things that differentiates between, if you will,

09:40.784 --> 09:49.697
Well, I have not seen a catalog of your collection yet.

09:49.717 --> 09:53.162
I have not seen a catalog, of course, of your collection.

09:53.182 --> 10:03.517
We can get to that, but my point is I understand that it's outstanding, that what you have put together is close to being preeminent in what it does.

10:04.619 --> 10:06.842
I hope so.

10:08.138 --> 10:18.430
I would imagine that some of the books, the printed books that you have, and extraordinarily rare editions, are probably available and inexpensive.

10:19.671 --> 10:25.578
You could probably, if you wanted just the information that was contained therein, you could go to the library or go and purchase it.

10:25.598 --> 10:26.239
Oh, absolutely.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.662
I just said that with differentiation.

10:28.682 --> 10:28.842
Okay.

10:28.862 --> 10:35.530
But my question for you is, how do you justify the acquisition of the rare

10:35.932 --> 10:39.355
You, Dr. Norman, justify the acquisition.

10:39.496 --> 10:41.658
Well, I think, as I said, it changes.

10:43.239 --> 11:00.897
One has to acknowledge that there's a difference between using books for, as I said, work or information studies and for some other purpose, which I call, if you will, play, pleasure, a hobby.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.059
And I think that's the important difference.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.061
Now, once you get into that aspect,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.407
then many other factors get involved.

11:09.228 --> 11:23.521
For example, in the first place, you have to have an interest in acquisition, and that's a psychological factor.

11:24.142 --> 11:31.969
You know, people who are interested in accumulation and acquisition frequently start out in a young age, don't they?

11:31.989 --> 11:35.672
They collect poster stamps, things like that.

11:36.108 --> 11:45.941
marbles, whatever children do, and some are more serious and other than that.

11:45.961 --> 11:50.728
But it still starts out as a hobby, right?

11:51.228 --> 11:58.778
And so it depends on to what degree that influences you in terms of your later life experience and activity.

11:58.798 --> 12:01.542
Now, if obviously it remains within certain bounds,

12:02.129 --> 12:17.265
You know, just like any other part of your personality, if your personality is adaptive in terms of society, then it's considered reasonably normal.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.988
If it's maladaptive, then you can start talking about madness and things like that.

12:20.668 --> 12:22.130
So, I mean, it's a common sense thing.

12:22.831 --> 12:26.955
So a hobbyist thing can be perfectly harmless,

12:27.475 --> 12:32.800
with what you want to say and provide a certain amount of recreation and pleasure.

12:32.820 --> 12:38.466
After all, there are all kinds of motivations to get into.

12:38.486 --> 12:40.788
Why does one want to do one once?

12:41.549 --> 12:56.824
If you're going to collect, I suppose, for reasons other than industry, when you're perfectly correct, you're not going to use the first edition of a particular book, particularly if you don't want to,

12:57.260 --> 13:01.986
depreciate its value if you want to look at it that way.

13:02.066 --> 13:11.597
You know, every time you open a red book, you exhaust it a little bit.

13:11.617 --> 13:12.578
So you don't need that.

13:12.698 --> 13:18.045
So you do it because it's something you want to be identified with.

13:18.065 --> 13:24.953
And then it becomes a matter of having something that distinguishes you from the next guy.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.575
I mean, after what is that?

13:26.943 --> 13:40.999
For example, I just, you know, when I first started out, I wasn't really that interested in first editions particularly.

13:41.019 --> 13:44.022
I was interested in getting things that I could use.

13:45.224 --> 13:56.376
And then I decided when I was on training as a psychoanalyst that I should buy a first edition of Lloyd Dutron's iPhone.

13:56.845 --> 13:58.327
I'm sorry, which, sir?

13:58.567 --> 14:04.656
It was Interpretation of Dreams.

14:04.676 --> 14:12.647
And so, I won't go into the details as to why that occurred, but anyhow, at that time it seemed like something interested me.

14:12.667 --> 14:16.372
And then after I bought that, I thought, well, why not?

14:16.392 --> 14:18.595
Maybe I should select a few of these others.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.437
And I remember I could still read German then.

14:20.457 --> 14:23.101
So we had very excellent English translations that were available, much easier.

14:23.121 --> 14:25.384
So I knew at that point I wasn't buying these books for...

14:25.853 --> 14:31.478
I decided, well, it's kind of fun.

14:31.498 --> 14:38.464
Let's see if I can collect enough of these so that I can have a set.

14:38.684 --> 14:42.227
You know, there's a certain amount of compulsion to get into it.

14:42.808 --> 14:51.876
And so I did that, and I started teaching the history of psychoanalysis, and I would bring my books to the classroom of students.

14:51.896 --> 14:55.759
And I started teaching the history of psychiatry, so I expanded my collection.

14:56.279 --> 14:57.961
I would get books that I could use.

14:58.481 --> 15:02.945
They were still used to rationalize up until those days.

15:02.965 --> 15:04.807
So I combined, if you will.

15:04.827 --> 15:06.408
You were rationalizing, you said?

15:06.588 --> 15:09.071
Yeah, of course, combining business with pleasure.

15:09.611 --> 15:12.293
I didn't need them.

15:12.313 --> 15:12.694
I didn't need them.

15:12.714 --> 15:19.860
I was, let me see, part of the reason for it was that there was an economic element.

15:19.880 --> 15:26.286
I was not a person of unlimited means, so I couldn't necessarily just simply say that

15:26.873 --> 15:36.327
This was a necessary thing, right?

15:36.347 --> 15:40.814
On the other hand, it wasn't a particular hardship or any problem.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.775
So this became my recreation.

15:41.795 --> 15:45.040
How old were you at a time?

15:45.320 --> 15:52.731
I was in my 30s.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.714
In 1953, I was in my late 30s.

15:54.734 --> 15:56.577
1950, about 62, I mean.

15:57.130 --> 16:03.018
Anyhow, the important element about it was exact.

16:03.038 --> 16:10.347
It also became a kind of form of social, additional social life.

16:10.788 --> 16:14.713
I corresponded with dealers throughout the world and pen pals.

16:15.374 --> 16:19.840
And I used to do this at night when I was finished with my work.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.924
In other words, in those days, I had young families.

16:23.625 --> 16:26.268
I had practice.

16:26.288 --> 16:26.749
So I...

16:27.235 --> 16:38.514
Usually around 10 or 11, my wife would probably by this time have retired, so then I'd pick up my catalogs.

16:38.634 --> 16:40.296
It was an hour of recreation.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.099
In fact, I never visited a bookstore.

16:42.200 --> 16:42.801
You never did?

16:42.941 --> 16:46.366
For a few number of years at the time.

16:47.248 --> 16:49.271
So it was mostly by correspondence.

16:49.632 --> 16:51.074
Did you buy at auction at all?

16:51.295 --> 16:54.019
No, never bought at auction in those days either.

16:54.286 --> 16:56.068
It wasn't a great boy, too.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.313
You must know my own opinion.

16:59.433 --> 17:03.198
I've written some of this up to you, but I'll let you read it.

17:03.218 --> 17:03.418
Oh, great.

17:03.438 --> 17:04.119
I'll let you read it.

17:04.720 --> 17:13.791
Anyhow, so, and this went on, I think, for a number of years.

17:14.312 --> 17:22.082
It was not a particularly, you know,

17:22.518 --> 17:33.171
It was out of interest, I must say, that I pursued with great diligence.

17:34.032 --> 17:36.115
But, you know, certain things interest me.

17:36.255 --> 17:48.350
If I went through a professional meeting, I remember one period I was looking for the etchings of Sigmund Freud, but that was still important to me.

17:48.370 --> 17:49.011
And those were hard to find.

17:49.031 --> 17:50.753
And I don't forget when I was

17:51.205 --> 18:00.559
in New York, and a young Viennese woman there, and she would say to me, aren't you interested in any good art, you know?

18:02.922 --> 18:09.693
As a matter of fact, she would twist my arm into buying a few good things, which I don't regret, and eventually sold.

18:09.713 --> 18:16.002
But that point is, it was not, there was no financial aspect involved in that aspect.

18:16.022 --> 18:18.025
It was strictly intellectual.

18:19.227 --> 18:20.689
Well, the things that you're interested

18:21.277 --> 18:48.195
I think as my financial situation became—there were a few other factors I went into, but I'm not going to skip over those—as my financial situation became better, and through a number of circumstances that you read about, I decided that I wanted

18:48.563 --> 18:56.931
By this time, I had a library that I didn't regard as particularly impressive when I began to compare with other people's libraries.

18:56.951 --> 18:59.634
So competition went into it.

18:59.654 --> 19:02.777
The competition factor did enter into it.

19:02.957 --> 19:03.197
Oh, yes.

19:03.337 --> 19:04.759
I think that's a very obvious thing.

19:04.779 --> 19:08.102
I want to have a better library in my hands.

19:08.262 --> 19:10.504
But better than everyone else.

19:10.924 --> 19:13.627
Not better than everybody else, but maybe as good as some.

19:13.647 --> 19:17.351
It was not possible to have better than everybody else.

19:17.451 --> 19:17.811
In other words,

19:18.500 --> 19:26.952
You know, if you're not an extraordinary wealthy man like Bill Scheid, you can't buy a Gutenberg idol.

19:26.972 --> 19:29.656
So you may have to settle for what you can afford.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.762
Or also be blessed by the fact that you've had two generations head start.

19:33.782 --> 19:35.224
I mean, his library is 125 years old.

19:35.244 --> 19:38.008
But even so, there are some people who still can do it, you know.

19:38.449 --> 19:40.471
So you have to sacrifice your own niche.

19:40.592 --> 19:45.098
So within your own niche, anyhow...

19:45.449 --> 19:52.357
We'll give you the write-up, and I hope you'll use them accordingly, that I wrote for the Introductionist Catalog.

19:52.738 --> 19:53.539
Oh, wonderful.

19:53.759 --> 19:53.919
Great.

19:53.939 --> 20:13.583
Because you'll discover that my meeting with booksellers, which eventually I started to travel more, was very important because I began to learn something about points of bibliography, which I had not been attentive to.

20:14.204 --> 20:22.872
And this was partially through correspondence and partially through experience.

20:24.514 --> 20:32.542
And then meeting some collectors who were substantial collectors in the area that interested me.

20:33.443 --> 20:36.666
So that was very influential.

20:37.507 --> 20:42.912
And so I just decided that, you know, part of the

20:43.381 --> 20:46.645
pleasure with the hunting for books.

20:46.665 --> 20:51.833
In other words, since they were hard to find, it was like fishing, you know.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.359
I used to go fishing when I was a lot younger.

20:56.379 --> 20:58.462
You know, you'd sit around doing a long time.

20:58.482 --> 21:00.905
If you're lucky, you get a bite, and you pull the fish in, right?

21:01.486 --> 21:11.920
So collecting books was, in many respects, similarly, you send out a lot of requests, and if you're lucky, the fish bites, you know.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.352
So you have a want list.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.413
You had a want list.

21:14.433 --> 21:19.261
No, I was not even a very... You know, a want list was not even an easy way to do it.

21:20.022 --> 21:21.785
I had a mental list.

21:21.805 --> 21:35.225
One of the big problems with sending want lists on I discovered was that there were so many people that would feel upset if you bought the book and then they forgot to tell them you no longer had on the want list.

21:35.245 --> 21:37.629
So it got to be... I did it for a while.

21:37.689 --> 21:38.510
I gave that up.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.573
I had my own want list.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.788
The most effective thing was establishing contacts.

21:44.728 --> 21:51.775
I mean, getting people to get to know you, and I say all that.

21:52.595 --> 21:57.760
So the big factor was to see whether you can find these things.

21:57.980 --> 22:04.406
Obviously, at this time, I was very familiar with some of the great collections in my field.

22:04.426 --> 22:10.611
I knew I'd always want to see whether Oostler had one or Sona had one or what they were like.

22:11.232 --> 22:23.545
So if I could find something that I was looking at, I was interested in rarity, I was interested in condition, I was interested in its price.

22:23.625 --> 22:35.857
Of course, I have to be realistic about this because, as I say, unless you have unlimited money, you can't, you know.

22:35.917 --> 22:39.501
Did you interview the people at the garden sale?

22:40.105 --> 22:42.008
When we're done, I'll be happy to tell you.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.892
I will have a chapter on the garden.

22:44.932 --> 22:46.714
Were you able to interview David O'Mara?

22:47.095 --> 22:47.255
No.

22:47.295 --> 22:47.916
Did you know him?

22:47.936 --> 22:49.518
I only met him one time.

22:49.959 --> 22:52.242
I didn't know him.

22:52.262 --> 22:54.726
I just wondered whether he knew anything more than I know.

22:54.926 --> 22:55.787
I probably do.

22:56.568 --> 22:57.370
I probably do.

22:57.750 --> 23:09.707
The reason I want to eventually, there's a book that's in that sale that I mentioned in my write-up about when I first got interested in

23:10.733 --> 23:15.240
some of the, shall we say, the expensive books.

23:17.283 --> 23:18.284
I had made some money.

23:18.605 --> 23:25.455
I had some extra money, which I made through some investments around the early 1960s.

23:26.797 --> 23:34.229
So I was traveling in London, and I had a friend who is a renowned bookseller, and I earned a smile.

23:34.249 --> 23:37.213
I say a friend because he'll be a correspondent for a number of years.

23:38.088 --> 23:41.393
And so I said to him, you know, I think I'd like to buy a great book.

23:42.815 --> 23:50.227
So I said, and he, I remember he had, well, we were just chatting over tea.

23:50.307 --> 23:56.597
I said, if you could pick out one great book, what would you buy?

23:56.617 --> 24:06.272
And he says to me, well, there's a copy of Copernicus that was written by, that was inscribed by Radicus.

24:07.163 --> 24:11.387
And this book, he said, has been in the market for about a year.

24:11.988 --> 24:15.071
And I said, what is it going to cost?

24:15.311 --> 24:16.333
He said, $12,000.

24:16.353 --> 24:17.614
That's not bad.

24:17.634 --> 24:20.417
Oh, it's not bad, right?

24:20.437 --> 24:23.720
So I come back to San Francisco, and this is all written up.

24:23.740 --> 24:24.261
Really?

24:24.281 --> 24:31.068
So I come back to San Francisco, and I'm talking now, visiting Warren Powell.

24:31.989 --> 24:34.812
He was a good friend of mine also.

24:34.852 --> 24:36.934
Diana worked for Warren.

24:37.606 --> 24:48.999
Anyhow, and Herbert M. Evans, who was a great scientist, an old man with a very distinguished and important man, and a bibliophile.

24:49.619 --> 24:51.261
Have you ever heard of him?

24:51.642 --> 24:52.683
Herbert M. Evans?

24:53.003 --> 24:53.764
No, I'm sorry.

24:53.824 --> 24:57.248
Have you heard about him in my introduction?

24:57.368 --> 25:04.115
Because he was a combination of bibliophile and some pathology.

25:04.135 --> 25:05.537
And I'll explain that later.

25:06.175 --> 25:10.520
So Herbert says to me, you're not going to get that book.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.562
I said, how come?

25:12.682 --> 25:15.886
He says, because Harrison Horvath in New York has it.

25:15.906 --> 25:18.269
So I said, well, I thought about it badly.

25:18.289 --> 25:22.493
So I said, well, can you please introduce me to Harrison Horvath?

25:22.593 --> 25:25.917
So anyhow, make a long story short.

25:27.038 --> 25:29.601
I met him, and that was an important meeting.

25:29.661 --> 25:34.647
But so

25:36.061 --> 25:43.210
Not having that book, we went on another tangent, but I'll go back six weeks a minute.

25:43.230 --> 25:49.078
So I would, you know, people would ask me how I got started playing.

25:49.098 --> 25:54.324
I said, well, I started out with the idea of getting this one book, which I missed, and so forth.

25:54.344 --> 26:02.575
So a number of years later, Lou David Feldman, who you may have heard out of the name, was one of the leading booksellers in

26:02.875 --> 26:05.178
He's a subject in my book, too.

26:05.198 --> 26:06.520
Well, I knew Luke Feldman.

26:06.801 --> 26:09.444
And I'd at some point love to get some thoughts of yours.

26:09.505 --> 26:11.788
I'm going to write it down so I don't forget.

26:11.808 --> 26:24.346
Well, Luke Feldman, you know, was a big entrepreneur who didn't really need publicity because he was making a living selling to the University of Texas.

26:24.506 --> 26:28.512
You know, he sold millions and millions of dollars worth of books.

26:28.532 --> 26:30.655
Anyhow, so one time,

26:31.057 --> 26:38.726
In 1968, Lou calls me up and he says, I can get you the book, he said, for $50,000.

26:38.746 --> 26:48.999
Well, I just couldn't pay $50,000 at the time, and so I said, so I just passed it out to Benton.

26:49.019 --> 26:51.922
I'm not as affluent as I can.

26:51.942 --> 26:58.330
I didn't have as much free cash as I would have liked, but I guess I wasn't ready to spend $50,000 on the book.

26:59.052 --> 27:03.318
But Lou knew of my interest in the book, and I talked to him in each book.

27:03.719 --> 27:08.605
So when the book, when Harrison's Library came out, he bought it for $100,000.

27:08.886 --> 27:14.213
And he sold it, I think, for about at least $150,000.

27:14.373 --> 27:18.840
And of course, at the auction, it sold for $400 and something thousand.

27:18.860 --> 27:21.664
So that was my involvement with that book.

27:22.284 --> 27:25.168
But that book was kind of significant.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.051
You asked me about Haven or Worth.

27:27.757 --> 27:28.898
You had met him?

27:29.078 --> 27:30.019
I met him only once.

27:30.339 --> 27:31.260
At a function?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.382
No, I met him and learned how his books were.

27:33.442 --> 27:33.923
Oh, really?

27:33.943 --> 27:34.143
Yeah.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.404
What was your impression?

27:35.964 --> 27:38.367
There was no way of having an impression to be honest.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.368
He seemed like a pedantic sort of man.

27:40.428 --> 27:42.270
Certainly nobody I could get close to.

27:42.310 --> 27:43.231
He didn't try.

27:43.851 --> 27:50.578
For that matter, he didn't amount to me to get the book collected, as far as I knew, until I saw the collection that he owned.

27:51.178 --> 27:56.683
Though I did know that he bought that book when he did after that, but this was before I think he bought that book.

27:57.490 --> 28:08.820
And he bought a copy of Harvey, which Warren sold, which was up to Conrad, which, as you may know, was a clear outlook and been stolen.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.561
Yes, that's right.

28:10.581 --> 28:12.523
It was a piece written.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.305
Maybe, I guess.

28:16.026 --> 28:18.488
Well, anything else you want to add?

28:18.548 --> 28:24.053
Before I forget, if we could just digress a bit on Lou Feldman, your impressions of him.

28:24.313 --> 28:25.655
I liked Lou Feldman.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.396
He was a rather...

28:28.304 --> 28:29.686
Elegant, handsome man.

28:29.806 --> 28:33.150
I meet him in New York.

28:34.372 --> 28:41.781
He liked to have hair, but he wore this lovely fur coat and a big collar and a gold cane.

28:41.801 --> 28:42.062
That's great.

28:42.082 --> 28:45.727
Lou Feldman had started out as a specialist in detective stories.

28:45.747 --> 28:47.168
That's correct.

28:47.188 --> 28:50.613
And he had a great affection for Sherlock Holmes.

28:50.633 --> 28:53.136
By the time I knew him, he was very successful.

28:53.156 --> 28:56.100
This beautiful apartment that he operated out of,

28:56.755 --> 28:57.936
his business.

28:57.956 --> 29:00.198
He had two apartments in New York.

29:00.318 --> 29:01.339
I remember.

29:01.359 --> 29:02.620
And he had some great things.

29:02.801 --> 29:11.308
And, you know, he had any, he had a card block because Harry Ransom was banking him.

29:11.468 --> 29:14.711
I bet he sold him $50,000 million worth of money.

29:15.912 --> 29:16.573
It's hard to say.

29:16.593 --> 29:19.115
We spent a week in Texas for this project.

29:19.135 --> 29:21.978
Do they know anything about it, really?

29:22.018 --> 29:24.320
You mean, if they know, they're not telling them.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.442
They probably don't, because it was a,

29:26.708 --> 29:37.180
You know, Harry Ransom ran that as his own private library, and he was able, you know, that was when oil was available and valuable, and he could raise the money.

29:37.641 --> 29:39.543
We personally think he did a great thing.

29:39.663 --> 29:43.768
I mean... Oh, I'm a great admirer of Luke Feldman.

29:43.788 --> 29:44.929
Don't misunderstand me.

29:44.949 --> 29:49.875
I mean, we think that the HIC is a monument that really needs very little justification.

29:50.015 --> 29:53.880
I agree, you know, he had the foresight to...

29:54.130 --> 29:57.414
I don't know who influenced who between the two of them.

29:57.474 --> 29:58.896
They had a great thing going.

29:59.817 --> 30:06.365
But, you know, he had a lot of power because of the support he was getting.

30:06.466 --> 30:12.233
And so he dominated the book scene in many respects.

30:12.253 --> 30:13.374
I'll never forget.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.497
I don't remember whether he actually...

30:16.253 --> 30:23.161
I don't remember whether they ever bought the Gutenberg Bible, but I remember— They got the Gutenberg Bible, but that came through the Pforzheimer.

30:23.381 --> 30:25.724
Actually, Perot put up the money.

30:25.744 --> 30:26.564
Oh, that came later.

30:26.645 --> 30:27.465
That came later.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.428
But Lewis tried to sell them.

30:29.448 --> 30:31.170
Lewis had died by then, I think.

30:31.270 --> 30:33.793
And he was trying to sell them one.

30:33.813 --> 30:34.193
I remember that.

30:34.613 --> 30:39.158
He was very—you know, Warren Howell was a very good—well, I won't say good friend.

30:39.199 --> 30:39.999
They did business.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.841
I don't know how you evaluate.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.223
That's how I remember.

30:44.266 --> 30:58.704
because I met him in San Francisco for the first time, and we got started talking, and I guess maybe I mentioned that story to him, and that's how we became it.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.507
And I would have dinner with him in New York.

31:01.628 --> 31:10.519
I'd go to New York maybe once or twice a year, and whenever he was alive, I would visit with him when I could, you know, maybe two or three times.

31:10.639 --> 31:11.360
I can't remember how.

31:11.380 --> 31:12.501
Did you buy books from him?

31:12.886 --> 31:32.295
He's a character, and Lou Feldman is a subject in my book.

31:32.461 --> 31:34.944
Well, I don't know who would know him.

31:35.304 --> 31:38.708
I've talked to quite a few people.

31:38.768 --> 31:42.873
But when you get a good picture, you know the story.

31:43.014 --> 31:46.918
I'm sure he was a source of great envy in the book trade when he was alive.

31:47.479 --> 31:50.422
Because he dominated so much, you see.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.283
And he had Texas.

31:52.104 --> 31:53.386
After all, H.P.

31:53.406 --> 31:59.413
Krause was the big man in the book world, and Luke Goldman was sort of an upstart, I think.

31:59.798 --> 32:09.967
And for a number of years, you know, he took on a comparable position, as I would guess, although I can't speak from great knowledge.

32:10.787 --> 32:15.571
What I knew mostly was what Warren Howell would tell me.

32:15.591 --> 32:22.117
From what people say, he really wanted to be known as the man who, behind the man who built the HRC in Texas.

32:22.137 --> 32:24.119
Well, I think it's true.

32:24.139 --> 32:26.841
I don't think there was any question about it.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.383
I remember one time he was telling me, he was

32:29.853 --> 32:43.427
I don't remember exactly, but apparently he was negotiating for the remains of the Elgin marbles from Lord Elgin for the university.

32:43.447 --> 32:46.409
That sounds like a Lou Feltman story, though.

32:46.430 --> 32:47.591
I remember that.

32:47.611 --> 32:52.836
A lot of these people like to talk about their achievements.

32:53.917 --> 32:58.982
So you put together a great collection, then, with

32:59.384 --> 33:01.666
Limitations.

33:01.726 --> 33:08.673
I mean, you imposed limitations on yourself, and yet you were still able to put together what many suggest is a great collection.

33:08.893 --> 33:12.877
How do you explain the success of Stuart Shack?

33:13.157 --> 33:13.317
Luck.

33:13.437 --> 33:13.817
Luck.

33:13.878 --> 33:17.901
Money and luck.

33:17.921 --> 33:19.283
I said this many years ago.

33:19.703 --> 33:24.748
Now, I think you have to have, what did I say?

33:24.908 --> 33:28.311
First, you have to have health.

33:28.780 --> 33:35.567
In addition to knowing what you want, you have to have a good relationship with the trade.

33:36.568 --> 33:45.096
In other words, if there are ten people who are in the same book, you have to be the lucky one that the people in the trade are going to direct it toward you.

33:45.817 --> 33:50.081
So I think for a number of years I had pretty good relationships with the trade.

33:51.002 --> 33:56.627
Then you have to also be in a position to pay the bill when you have the opportunity.

33:57.198 --> 34:03.347
As long as the books were not too expensive, there weren't too much interest.

34:03.367 --> 34:19.933
I mean, a big factor is also the time you're collecting because, in other words, right now it would be a very difficult time, relatively speaking, because books are much scarcer, and also they're much more expensive, relatively speaking.

34:19.993 --> 34:24.640
You know, 40 years ago you could buy some of these books for, for example,

34:25.042 --> 34:32.870
The first edition I paid, I bought a Freud's, and it was $75.

34:33.991 --> 34:40.858
Now you probably have to pay $10,000 for it, so it makes a difference whether $75,000, $75 I had.

34:41.018 --> 34:43.581
What was the title of that book again, I'm sorry?

34:43.601 --> 34:44.402
The one that you take?

34:44.422 --> 34:46.464
The Traumdeutung, 1900.

34:48.006 --> 34:50.408
It's The Interpretation of Dreams.

34:53.307 --> 34:56.652
Do you collect in several and many languages?

34:56.812 --> 34:59.737
Yes, whatever languages the books are written in.

34:59.977 --> 35:05.886
Not necessarily could read them all, although I have some familiarity with those little languages.

35:05.906 --> 35:07.588
Did you ever consider it more than a hobby?

35:08.850 --> 35:10.513
I mean, like what, a business?

35:10.533 --> 35:10.793
No.

35:11.144 --> 35:12.706
My son, of course, does.

35:12.726 --> 35:14.348
I'm interested in that.

35:14.388 --> 35:16.952
Is this a coincidence, by the way, that Jeremy went into books?

35:17.012 --> 35:19.896
Well, he can tell you that one.

35:21.838 --> 35:24.862
My version might be different.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.786
Clearly, books were a very important part of your home.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.070
In my life, in our home, yes.

35:30.290 --> 35:33.594
Our children were exposed to the home.

35:33.614 --> 35:39.362
My wife is a great reader, and we encourage our children to read.

35:39.967 --> 35:40.928
I have two children.

35:41.148 --> 35:43.611
My daughter is a physician.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.533
She's not a collector.

35:45.553 --> 35:48.917
Yes, she's there, but she doesn't collect.

35:50.099 --> 35:53.643
My wife does some interesting collecting.

35:53.663 --> 35:54.544
What does she practice?

35:55.165 --> 35:58.448
My daughter, internal medicine.

35:58.468 --> 36:00.731
Have you always been a Californian, by the way?

36:00.751 --> 36:02.954
No, I was born in Massachusetts.

36:02.974 --> 36:03.815
Oh, really?

36:03.835 --> 36:04.135
Where?

36:04.773 --> 36:05.955
Lynn, Massachusetts.

36:06.255 --> 36:06.676
Lynn?

36:06.856 --> 36:08.259
I was born in Lowell, which is nice.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.582
Well, not so far from here.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.425
I'm familiar with Wood Street.

36:13.026 --> 36:14.328
And when did you come out here?

36:15.290 --> 36:17.113
California?

36:17.373 --> 36:17.714
Yeah.

36:17.734 --> 36:20.378
January 1, 1947, Uncle Sam, United States Army.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.165
And is there a biographical thing that we could have?

36:25.185 --> 36:25.927
Not about that.

36:26.047 --> 36:28.671
No, I mean about just if there's something that I would

36:29.073 --> 36:31.999
bothering you with the biographical background stuff?

36:32.059 --> 36:39.576
I don't think I have any on my biography, but I have something on my book collection.

36:39.856 --> 36:40.738
Anything else?

36:40.758 --> 36:44.466
Can you think of anything like that, Dr. Norman?

36:46.673 --> 36:51.120
Yeah, we interviewed a physician down in Los Angeles, Dr. Pincus, Erwin Pincus.

36:51.140 --> 36:51.581
Have you seen him?

36:51.601 --> 36:52.903
Yeah, we saw him two days ago.

36:52.923 --> 36:56.548
Handled his Harvey and his Copernicus as a matter of fact.

36:57.169 --> 36:57.710
Nice man.

36:57.910 --> 36:59.473
Very nice man, yeah.

36:59.493 --> 37:05.442
And one thing I've noticed, and maybe it's coincidental or whatever, but so many

37:06.164 --> 37:11.290
really good and dedicated book collectors happen to be physicians.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.572
And I wonder if there's any of you.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.713
And this is through history.

37:13.753 --> 37:14.754
This isn't just now.

37:14.834 --> 37:17.698
Well, I don't know the answer to that.

37:17.758 --> 37:32.796
I think that for a long time there wasn't that much information available to doctors that they could use in the treatment of patients.

37:33.316 --> 37:38.204
and a lot of the information that was available was historic information.

37:38.224 --> 37:56.233
You know, up through the Renaissance, people were reading the documents that were preserved from the Greek and Roman eras, and it was a big transition during the Renaissance when they began to have a more scientific approach, if you will.

37:56.994 --> 37:59.037
You know, the whole idea of the

38:00.215 --> 38:09.485
the rebirth of learning and so forth, which had been, if you will, inhibited by the religious element and so forth, started then.

38:09.986 --> 38:18.515
But there weren't any significant gains in medicine until, after all, last century, in terms of the ability to treat disease.

38:18.555 --> 38:27.285
I mean, the bacterial concept of disease has established in the last century, so doctors would depend on what they

38:27.822 --> 38:30.565
hopefully they could lean on authorities for.

38:31.106 --> 38:32.808
So books were very important.

38:32.848 --> 38:56.715
Now obviously the whole idea of learning from patients progressed from the beginning of the Renaissance when they started dissecting bodies and they started looking, observing patients, you know, as if this, it wasn't necessarily a new idea, but it was new because they began to depart from historical authority so that

38:57.303 --> 39:03.369
Books became very important, and the combination, you see, of studying your patient and using books is very important.

39:03.389 --> 39:05.512
Now, for this, you didn't need old books.

39:05.792 --> 39:10.257
The practice had libraries.

39:10.737 --> 39:13.520
Now, as collectors, I think it's the same as today.

39:13.680 --> 39:20.247
I think that some people were more interested in the acquisition aspect.

39:20.307 --> 39:24.171
Some were interested in the hobby aspect.

39:24.758 --> 39:35.751
I think the big impetus for our generation came from Sir William Osler, who was an important American physician, a Canadian-American physician.

39:35.991 --> 39:40.176
You'll find that in my opinion, too.

39:40.297 --> 39:43.881
How many doctors at the end of the year besides Jack Pinkus?

39:44.642 --> 39:47.125
Not many, but it's just a phenomenon that I've noticed.

39:47.445 --> 39:49.107
Well, I don't know that many.

39:49.167 --> 39:50.248
I know Jack Pinkus.

39:50.268 --> 39:51.610
I know a few others.

39:52.113 --> 39:56.457
And he has one of the outstanding collections that I'm aware of.

39:57.398 --> 40:02.423
And I don't know, you know, I don't know.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.485
I mean, I've noticed it more through history.

40:04.505 --> 40:16.117
Well, through history, but of course, it's true because, well, my son wrote that and some of that up because he was interested in people with catalogs and libraries.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.559
And, and,

40:20.007 --> 40:21.048
Jeremy wrote that up?

40:21.068 --> 40:22.710
Yeah, it's going in our catalog.

40:22.730 --> 40:23.130
Oh, is it?

40:23.150 --> 40:24.392
Good.

40:24.412 --> 40:26.214
When is your catalog going to be published again?

40:26.234 --> 40:32.541
You want to lift your thing up there, Diana, and show the brochure.

40:34.043 --> 40:35.204
These are for us?

40:35.684 --> 40:36.726
Oh, wonderful.

40:36.746 --> 40:37.366
That's the prospectus?

40:37.386 --> 40:38.848
This is the prospectus.

40:38.868 --> 40:39.429
Oh, great.

40:39.449 --> 40:42.412
And that's it?

40:42.432 --> 40:43.333
This is you, Diana?

40:45.696 --> 40:46.657
Are you familiar?

40:46.677 --> 40:48.559
Oh, this is great.

40:48.579 --> 40:48.799
Thank you.

40:50.011 --> 41:01.686
Are you familiar with that essay that was written in the psychiatric journal about 20 years ago by a psychiatrist named, I think it's Wiener, about bibliomania?

41:01.726 --> 41:05.391
Yeah, not Wiener.

41:05.411 --> 41:06.012
It should be, probably.

41:06.052 --> 41:07.754
It's about the only professional article.

41:07.774 --> 41:08.695
Anything useful?

41:09.436 --> 41:12.520
Well, I mean, he really goes into a disquisition.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.503
Do you know what journal it is?

41:14.523 --> 41:16.465
I'm going to send you a copy of it.

41:16.485 --> 41:18.448
In fact, I don't have one with me.

41:18.952 --> 41:19.833
I don't have one with me.

41:19.853 --> 41:20.775
I thought I might have learned.

41:20.815 --> 41:22.157
I'm going to leave you my card now.

41:22.177 --> 41:24.861
Was he a real collector?

41:26.504 --> 41:27.465
It doesn't indicate.

41:27.766 --> 41:30.790
Or was he just speculating?

41:30.830 --> 41:37.180
No, he must have been a collector, because he really knew the history.

41:37.514 --> 41:47.624
a lot of the cases, the famous cases, the Libri case, and the Libri case, and the other things.

41:47.644 --> 41:57.374
So he knew the history, and he got through the books, and he gave some analyses, I guess.

41:57.954 --> 42:02.919
I'll absolutely make sure I send you copies when you get home.

42:02.939 --> 42:06.863
I just had wondered if you had probably caused some

42:07.400 --> 42:11.969
It's about 15 or 66, I guess, when it was published.

42:12.570 --> 42:17.900
And I just found it scrolling through the UMass Medical, the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.

42:17.920 --> 42:20.405
I just go up there one day and went through their file.

42:20.545 --> 42:30.184
I'm not too familiar with much that's been written about collecting, but it's rather interesting.

42:32.375 --> 42:37.019
Charles Darwin wrote about this a little bit in his autobiography.

42:37.039 --> 42:37.239
He did?

42:37.259 --> 42:38.180
That's right.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.683
I'm going to help you out today.

42:43.165 --> 43:02.382
He said he was a collector, and when he was young, he collected, let's see, I guess, he collected shells and coins, and I guess, Franks, which were the postage things on those days, and I guess,

43:02.868 --> 43:05.430
I know he collected beagles, you know, and so forth.

43:05.871 --> 43:22.407
So he made a comment that if you're, and nobody else in this family was a collector, but if you are a collector, you may become a natural historian, as he regards a virtuoso or a miser.

43:22.427 --> 43:28.633
And these are the, so in other words, he saw the range of possibilities.

43:28.653 --> 43:31.255
So you can see that he included the pathology.

43:31.876 --> 43:47.838
the extraordinary achiever, because after all, people, how do you differentiate between people who are so creative and collect so many ideas that they can put together and assemble?

43:47.858 --> 43:50.802
And so that's what we regarded, I guess, as a virtue.

43:50.822 --> 43:58.373
At what point did you realize that you were really putting together something more than the satisfaction of a pastime?

43:59.213 --> 44:03.397
Well, you were assembling a major collection.

44:03.417 --> 44:16.431
Well, I think this was supplemented by my son, for example, who got interested in the book world in 1964.

44:17.352 --> 44:28.984
And I think that this was a very important factor in my life, because he became a companion

44:29.791 --> 44:45.149
And he actually went through my collection before he started his business, which was some 29 years ago.

44:45.169 --> 44:51.156
And I felt rather pleased that he thought it was a good thing.

44:51.396 --> 44:53.078
He was young then, of course.

44:53.439 --> 44:57.764
He had been working for Warren Howell, you see, for a number of years.

44:57.784 --> 44:59.646
That happened to be a job that he got.

45:00.250 --> 45:06.980
because at one time he needed a job, and Warren was the only businessman I knew, so it worked out well.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.422
That's how he got started.

45:08.442 --> 45:10.125
I think I'll have to talk to Jeremy.

45:10.145 --> 45:13.209
Oh, I think you should, because he knows a lot more about these things than I do.

45:13.229 --> 45:17.375
Well, but I'd like to know a little bit about... He'll be back on Tuesday.

45:17.616 --> 45:19.578
I'll give him a call.

45:19.719 --> 45:28.772
Yeah, but so I think that that was an important factor, because it always concerned me that

45:30.187 --> 45:46.774
My health had been pretty precarious at 30 times in my life, and I was always concerned that I had a collection of valuable books, but that there was nobody that I could depend on to disperse anything that happened to me.

45:46.794 --> 45:54.827
So when he got involved in the book trade, I began to feel reassured that he was interested, and I knew that that was

45:55.027 --> 46:13.823
Now, I'd already bought most of the, or many of the most important books that were in the catalog, that really made the collection important, but at that time I had more freedom to feel that it wouldn't just get lost, in other words.

46:13.843 --> 46:24.713
And we also, we sort of had an agreement that, when he started his business,

46:25.537 --> 46:34.447
I naturally, as a parent, was very supportive, particularly in finding books as an interest in me.

46:34.467 --> 46:42.176
So I lent him, I should say, I didn't lend him money, I lent him books.

46:42.316 --> 46:47.562
I lent him books because I didn't want to sell them to him either.

46:47.582 --> 46:50.385
I'd give them to him either.

46:50.405 --> 46:52.928
So I made it easy for him to dance.

46:53.313 --> 46:58.300
you have to owe me a favor someday, and that is, someday you can catalog my library.

46:59.121 --> 46:59.842
And that's true.

46:59.962 --> 47:02.946
I mean, so we had that deal.

47:02.966 --> 47:05.390
Well, so that was a big impetus.

47:05.890 --> 47:06.892
How many years ago was that?

47:07.292 --> 47:11.218
Well, that was 21 years ago, I guess, when he started business.

47:11.238 --> 47:15.143
So the pledge was made 20 years ago to catalog the library.

47:15.163 --> 47:15.664
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47:15.684 --> 47:22.493
And, well, you know, because, well, I guess he had his own reasons for agreeing to it.

47:22.743 --> 47:32.593
But the important thing was, that gave me the feeling, you see, that I had somebody I could depend on.

47:33.013 --> 47:44.765
Because it wasn't fair to my wife, and knowing how collections are frequently picked up by people, particularly if you don't know what they're worth, you know.

47:45.306 --> 47:49.290
And since this was an important asset to my family, I was really,

47:49.692 --> 47:54.377
That made it possible for me to comfortably continue to collect.

47:54.397 --> 48:02.086
And so, you know, most of the important books that are illustrated there, I owned by that time.

48:03.428 --> 48:09.074
But I continued to collect, of course, as you read, until a few months ago.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.217
So I just thought.

48:11.677 --> 48:15.622
So this has gone on for seven years now.

48:16.423 --> 48:18.585
Is your collection essentially complete then?

48:19.004 --> 48:19.565
No.

48:20.926 --> 48:25.511
But I mean, in your mind, you said you collected up until several months ago.

48:25.531 --> 48:27.273
How are you still looking is what I'm asking.

48:27.293 --> 48:30.917
Well, this is a moot point now.

48:30.937 --> 48:36.162
Once you publish a catalog of a collection, you sort of, this is a moot point.

48:36.743 --> 48:38.185
I can't put any more on the catalog.

48:38.205 --> 48:40.747
Yeah, but you could bring out an addendum.

48:40.767 --> 48:45.012
There's no plan to issue another catalog.

48:45.599 --> 48:50.505
Yeah, but you must run across things that you say, gee, that really belongs in the collection.

48:50.525 --> 48:54.549
Yeah, well, of course, but I've been doing that for years, and I've had to reject them too, you know?

48:54.870 --> 48:57.713
How many volumes approximately is the Baby Day?

48:57.813 --> 49:02.138
About 2,600.

49:02.178 --> 49:03.820
What is your hope for the library?

49:04.281 --> 49:09.006
Well, would you like to see it remain as a collection?

49:09.026 --> 49:12.470
Well, I really don't think that I'm going to decide that.

49:12.490 --> 49:13.651
I'll put it very simply.

49:13.771 --> 49:15.133
I'm not going to...

49:15.603 --> 49:21.853
donated to a university, looking to pride my family of the financial aspect.

49:23.135 --> 49:25.318
I think that's a realistic thing.

49:26.240 --> 49:32.430
The catalog would be sufficient to satisfy my ego, if you will.

49:32.450 --> 49:41.965
And if it's decided, it won't be decided, I don't think, during my lifetime.

49:42.755 --> 49:52.970
would probably either be dispersed at auction, or it could be sold on block, depending on whatever arrangement they want to make.

49:52.990 --> 50:01.824
But my own feeling, I thought about this very seriously, and I just decided, it's not worth it to me.

50:01.844 --> 50:04.868
You know, if I'm gone, what difference would they have a wing somewhere?

50:04.889 --> 50:07.533
I don't think it'll get a wing, but anyhow.

50:07.993 --> 50:10.517
But the point about it is, so I expect my

50:10.767 --> 50:15.634
my heirs to get some of the proceeds.

50:15.654 --> 50:20.902
Maybe some will keep some books, maybe some will take money.

50:20.962 --> 50:27.592
He would like some of the books, I'm sure, and I hope he can get them too.

50:27.792 --> 50:35.264
So therefore, the production, the publication of the catalog for you is a great event?

50:35.404 --> 50:39.610
It's a very important event, because you see,

50:39.877 --> 50:56.201
If you go over my experience as a collector, I had more contact with the catalogs of libraries I did with the actual books because, you know, I couldn't go to Yale every so often or go to McGill.

50:56.501 --> 50:59.405
I went to Uppsala once.

50:59.525 --> 51:02.510
I couldn't even see the books, you know.

51:02.790 --> 51:06.736
So the catalogs of the libraries were the tools I used.

51:07.437 --> 51:09.580
And this is going to be a great tool.

51:10.268 --> 51:13.273
I think it's going to be a great source of information.

51:13.394 --> 51:25.896
Is it going to be very richly, the bibliography, are you going to really give the points and are you really going to try and give as thorough a bibliography as you can for each of these?

51:25.916 --> 51:29.222
Yes, each description will have relations and plate counts.

51:29.557 --> 51:42.676
And if there are issue points, there's a problem with issue points.

51:42.696 --> 51:45.540
There's, I think, that I've pointed out, which haven't been pointed out before as well.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.101
Would you look at a sample?

51:46.121 --> 51:46.461
There's a sample.

51:46.481 --> 51:46.962
Yeah, there is a sample.

51:46.982 --> 51:48.143
There's a sample, a couple of samples.

51:48.164 --> 51:48.544
In here?

51:48.564 --> 51:48.985
Right in there, yeah.

51:49.005 --> 51:54.392
Well, we're probably going to buy a set of these, actually.

51:54.412 --> 51:54.573
Good.

51:54.593 --> 51:57.657
That's one of my collecting interests is catalogs.

51:57.957 --> 52:21.102
Well, as far as we know, there's no science catalog for science that has ever been compared with this as of now, maybe in the future, because all of those that I'm familiar with do not have all of the descriptions and the detail that they have spent all this time on.

52:21.122 --> 52:23.965
Have you been on it from the beginning?

52:24.325 --> 52:24.826
We've been on it.

52:24.846 --> 52:26.367
They're going to have big celebrations.

52:26.387 --> 52:27.829
What's the limitation going to be?

52:28.518 --> 52:44.515
I guess this is a question I always ask.

52:44.835 --> 52:51.002
How do you enjoy your collection?

52:51.182 --> 52:58.069
Once you acquire, do you get the most satisfaction out of the acquisition?

52:58.640 --> 53:00.202
Do you continue to enjoy it?

53:00.282 --> 53:00.903
It varies.

53:00.923 --> 53:07.272
For example, now that I have the leisure, see, I'm virtually retired professionally.

53:09.295 --> 53:17.887
So I, I guess it was 1985, we put out an exhibit for the National Association of Bibliophiles that came here.

53:18.387 --> 53:23.134
So I was able to show my collection to them, some of it.

53:23.214 --> 53:27.600
Last, earlier this last year, we, we,

53:28.070 --> 53:39.204
I had an exhibit of my Freud collection at Stanford in conjunction with an exhibit of Freud's art collection.

53:39.224 --> 53:44.591
And I guess September, that's going to the Groyer Club in New York for the Freud material.

53:44.791 --> 53:46.873
So I've enjoyed that aspect.

53:47.234 --> 53:53.341
I've talked about it in various places, in Copenhagen.

53:54.403 --> 53:57.807
I've talked about it in San Francisco.

53:58.175 --> 54:07.127
I've written more recently now at times things that are either directly or indirectly related to some of the things.

54:08.248 --> 54:15.377
Now, as far as, a lot of it depends on the impetus.

54:15.938 --> 54:18.742
Today I'm enjoying my collection.

54:18.882 --> 54:22.827
I'm talking to you about it.

54:22.847 --> 54:28.114
Actually, there aren't that many people within I can discuss it.

54:28.988 --> 54:30.850
Do you have any of the books here?

54:30.871 --> 54:31.431
Yes, I have.

54:31.451 --> 54:34.075
Maybe we can see a few at some point, if that's okay.

54:34.195 --> 54:34.575
Yeah, we can see.

54:35.036 --> 54:39.041
You know, of course, that Freud gave his only lecture in North America, in Worcester.

54:39.562 --> 54:41.705
Yeah, I know, of course.

54:42.146 --> 54:43.227
At Clark.

54:43.387 --> 54:46.712
Yeah, at Clark, uh, and the Clark lectures.

54:46.732 --> 54:47.913
Well, everybody knows that.

54:47.953 --> 54:54.082
That's one of Worcester's great claims, Robert Goddard and Sigmund Freud.

54:55.103 --> 54:57.286
Yeah, yeah.

54:57.326 --> 54:57.426
Yeah.

54:58.537 --> 55:00.521
Well, how much time do you want to spend?

55:00.561 --> 55:08.055
Well, I could ask a few more questions, but I don't want you to, I don't want to extend my welcome either.

55:08.776 --> 55:14.166
I guess there's still that lingering, I'm just going to turn these things on the other side because I think they're ready to turn on.
