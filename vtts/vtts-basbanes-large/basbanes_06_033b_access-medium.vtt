WEBVTT

00:04.756 --> 00:14.853
Thank you.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.047
For me to do anything by halves is not my nature.

00:23.067 --> 00:26.473
If I was going to sell any part of my collection, I was going to sell it all.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.637
My book collection.

00:29.056 --> 00:32.161
And that's how I feel.

00:32.181 --> 00:38.309
If I was gonna sell any of my Chippendale furniture, I would sell the entire Chippendale collection.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.454
If I'd sell any of the federal furniture, I'd sell a federal collection.

00:41.474 --> 00:47.423
I'm not gonna cut the heart out of any collection and cheat the public.

00:47.463 --> 00:57.257
Because if you sell something, let people come and buy and be offered the extent of what you've put together.

00:58.942 --> 00:59.963
And that's how I feel.

01:00.463 --> 01:02.625
Are you a victim of the recession?

01:03.046 --> 01:04.767
No, nobody's a victim.

01:04.867 --> 01:06.789
We all are in command of our own life.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.952
And I'm a victim of myself.

01:10.773 --> 01:16.238
I'm not a victim of any third party or third influence.

01:17.319 --> 01:18.620
I'm not a victim, incidentally.

01:19.401 --> 01:21.363
I'm in command of my own life.

01:22.784 --> 01:26.147
I simply have to raise your money, and therefore I've got to figure out where to raise it from.

01:26.617 --> 01:31.745
I simply have to raise some money and have to figure out where to raise it from.

01:31.765 --> 01:32.265
That's all.

01:32.285 --> 01:35.070
It's as simple as that.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.513
I mean, there's no mystery.

01:38.274 --> 01:44.944
There's no... Let's talk a little bit about the economy, if you want.

01:45.004 --> 01:51.935
I mean, do you think that... See, the advertising business has had a big slowdown.

01:52.656 --> 01:55.560
And my basic business is media, and that's the heart of advertising.

01:56.097 --> 01:58.400
And advertisers have cut their budgets.

02:00.103 --> 02:12.061
And that was complicated not only by the cutting of budgets because of the recession, but by the war in Iran, in Iraq, rather, has caused... In the Persian Gulf War.

02:12.081 --> 02:13.883
In the Persian Gulf War.

02:13.903 --> 02:21.154
The Persian Gulf War has caused a tremendous stoppage of advertising.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.117
Stoppage of advertising aside...

02:23.603 --> 02:28.489
This all affects what we do for a living, and cash flow is very important.

02:29.390 --> 02:40.284
In order for us to continue to collect, we have to start shelling some things, which you have to understand is not abnormal.

02:41.305 --> 02:45.590
Every collector that I've ever known sold part of his collection to acquire other things.

02:46.151 --> 02:48.814
We never sold any of our collections to acquire anything.

02:49.535 --> 02:53.340
In the 20 years of my marriage, I didn't have to sell part of my collection to acquire another part.

02:54.198 --> 03:01.565
So the fact that I have to sell a small, I'm talking about 5% of my collection.

03:01.845 --> 03:04.607
Let's go back to the verb have.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.549
Do you have to sell this, by the way?

03:06.569 --> 03:09.092
No, no, I don't have to, but if I would like.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.935
Thank you very much, sir.

03:12.955 --> 03:13.155
Thank you.

03:13.175 --> 03:13.736
I haven't done anything yet.

03:14.657 --> 03:17.719
I don't have to sell it.

03:17.739 --> 03:23.985
But I would rather sell it than part with any more cash out of my cash reserves.

03:24.623 --> 03:25.304
That's the difference.

03:25.564 --> 03:27.306
I could simply write a check and sell a piece to buy.

03:28.368 --> 03:29.950
I'd not sell anything.

03:29.970 --> 03:45.049
But it gave me the, it started me thinking that, hey, what a marvelous opportunity to, hey, might get down to sell a piece and continue on.

03:46.250 --> 03:53.820
Going back to the old craft table shooter and baccarat player, did you enjoy the run while you had it?

03:54.121 --> 03:56.425
All the books.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.606
I loved it.

03:57.626 --> 04:02.294
And the one, you know, Mike Todd, let me tell you about Mike Todd.

04:04.036 --> 04:14.673
In 1958, when I read Mike Todd's biography, I remember a very poignant question that was asked him.

04:15.234 --> 04:22.305
They said, and this does not apply to me, but I want to give the example because it says a lot that may apply to me.

04:24.344 --> 04:27.508
They said to Mike Todd, how does it feel to be poor?

04:27.709 --> 04:29.071
And please, I'm not poor.

04:30.372 --> 04:32.255
My collection is worth a hundred million bucks.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.442
They said, Mike Todd, how does it feel to be poor?

04:38.624 --> 04:39.866
And Mike said, I'm not poor.

04:39.966 --> 04:42.590
I'm temporarily out of funds.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.911
And that was the truth.

04:43.931 --> 04:49.139
And it certainly was at a time before he produced Around the World in 80 Days.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.984
So all I'm saying is that

04:53.133 --> 05:04.285
I wish I could offer you the romance of having one of your subjects as a play, a romance?

05:04.345 --> 05:05.006
No, no, no, that's okay.

05:05.026 --> 05:05.506
I understand.

05:05.927 --> 05:11.233
I wish I could offer you the ultimate romance of making this a depression kind of a situation.

05:11.253 --> 05:12.194
No, no, no, believe me.

05:12.214 --> 05:12.474
It's not.

05:12.494 --> 05:13.095
It's just, it's not.

05:13.255 --> 05:16.018
What it is is that... Times are tough.

05:16.518 --> 05:18.921
Times are tough.

05:19.373 --> 05:28.645
Rather than start to liquidate more cash, it's smarter to liquidate a little bit of the total collection.

05:29.205 --> 05:36.975
And what I have to liquidate, unfortunately, is the thing that you are most interested in, and that I am very interested in, and that I am very interested in, is books.

05:37.275 --> 05:39.758
You know where I'm coming from?

05:40.439 --> 05:45.145
You don't owe anybody anything.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.626
And the final analogy.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.207
Touche.

05:48.169 --> 05:51.334
Big, big, big fucking deal if you have to sell your books.

05:51.555 --> 05:52.076
Exactly.

05:52.657 --> 05:55.041
They were for sale when you bought them.

05:55.061 --> 05:56.884
They're for sale now when you sell them.

05:57.385 --> 06:01.372
You're more eloquent than I. You said it better than I could.

06:01.993 --> 06:02.514
Who cares?

06:02.674 --> 06:03.135
Who cares?

06:03.335 --> 06:03.916
Exactly.

06:04.377 --> 06:05.399
What difference does it make?

06:05.539 --> 06:06.761
And the grand scheme of things.

06:06.801 --> 06:07.723
The grand scheme of things.

06:08.092 --> 06:09.614
I'm sorry.

06:09.634 --> 06:09.935
Please.

06:10.115 --> 06:11.818
I'm talking and I'm supposed to be listening.

06:11.858 --> 06:12.238
No, no.

06:12.799 --> 06:21.552
Sometimes, sometimes the great author is the one who has total comprehension of the subject.

06:21.673 --> 06:26.800
How can you write well about a subject if you can't truly understand the total depth?

06:26.860 --> 06:34.692
Well, there are guys who came into the field, saw the stuff, had the wherewithal to acquire it, who acquired it, paid big bucks.

06:34.732 --> 06:35.854
Everybody did good.

06:36.087 --> 06:37.548
The auction houses did well.

06:37.588 --> 06:38.669
The booksellers did well.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.071
The sellers did well.

06:40.091 --> 06:41.552
And when I sell, I will do well.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.054
You gave them a very nice home.

06:44.254 --> 06:44.835
I surely did.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.158
And now you're sending them off to a new life.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.240
Which incidentally... So what's the problem?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.401
And it's very important.

06:51.481 --> 07:00.169
And if I say nothing else, because this is the crux and the hub of why the books are being sold aside from everything else I've told you.

07:00.189 --> 07:02.371
I put collections together, which we give away.

07:03.352 --> 07:04.693
But I have said this...

07:05.720 --> 07:18.834
From the day I started buying books, and anybody who knows me, any dealer who knows me, any collector who knows me, knows this is Dick Manny, and this is not something I've invented for this interview or because of why I'm selling the books.

07:18.854 --> 07:20.236
Very important.

07:20.256 --> 07:27.563
The one thing I said I would do, no matter what, was sell my books at public auction when they came up for sale.

07:28.424 --> 07:34.731
And you can check this with Jim, you can check this with Mark Hyatt, anybody who's been close to me.

07:35.133 --> 07:40.661
and knows my philosophy, that if I had to sell my books, they would go to public sale and not to an institution.

07:40.681 --> 08:00.832
The reason for this is I have always believed what every great book collector has known, that books must go back and have an opportunity to circulate in other hands.

08:00.852 --> 08:02.254
It's not my paintings.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.670
It's not like objects.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.592
A book is a very special thing.

08:07.372 --> 08:12.317
And to take those books out of circulation is a crime.

08:13.598 --> 08:21.646
Because nobody sees a book in an institution unless he fills out a slip and has it handed to him.

08:22.907 --> 08:25.430
They're not on the wall of museums.

08:25.450 --> 08:31.195
They're not on the floors of museums like furniture or the walls of museums like paintings.

08:31.462 --> 08:33.925
They're not out there for the public to see.

08:33.945 --> 08:45.558
A book is something that is hidden, that is behind walls, that is behind closed doors, that no one, you give your book collection to an institution, it is gone forever.

08:46.059 --> 08:53.868
It is out of sight, it is out of mind, except to those few people who live in a rarefied atmosphere, and only a small percentage of them.

08:54.749 --> 08:58.954
They have to go into that institution, first of all, they've got to identify the institution,

08:59.423 --> 09:01.466
They have to go to that institution.

09:01.546 --> 09:02.868
They have to travel to it.

09:02.888 --> 09:04.029
Justify themselves.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.471
Justify themselves.

09:06.072 --> 09:10.038
Fill out a slip and have somebody bring it to them and lay it out for them.

09:11.199 --> 09:17.348
We don't believe that that is what fine works of literature or objects should be.

09:17.368 --> 09:26.460
They should be in the hands of people who will love them, who will use them, who will read them, who will point them out to others, who will keep

09:27.284 --> 09:28.506
the flame alive.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.930
Good stuff.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.233
Very good.

09:32.253 --> 09:34.236
Good.

09:36.741 --> 09:44.735
I fought the first Camelina in 20 years.

09:44.755 --> 09:45.576
That came up at all?

09:46.317 --> 09:46.518
Yeah.

09:46.538 --> 09:48.401
You understand what I'm saying?

09:48.421 --> 09:48.521
Yeah.

09:48.541 --> 09:52.448
I'm sorry that you didn't pick my Camelina up because it would be more poignant.

09:52.748 --> 10:01.803
In other words, I have been a forerunner in a lot of areas.

10:04.027 --> 10:13.423
I reopened a lot of areas of book collecting with a passion.

10:16.036 --> 10:26.013
And I had more of a universality, more of a... And I was in so many different areas.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.798
Of course, I had so many interests, you know.

10:29.899 --> 10:32.344
And I love the garden collection.

10:33.806 --> 10:35.048
It's very stratified.

10:36.130 --> 10:39.436
All the books that have meaning and the history of life.

10:39.456 --> 10:40.457
You understand what I'm saying?

10:40.497 --> 10:42.060
I'm going to go out and buy those books.

10:42.479 --> 10:43.460
You know, give me a list.

10:46.224 --> 10:48.606
And then go get a Quartz or, you know.

10:48.626 --> 10:51.970
Patrick Freeman, or Tom Holland, Franklin.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.313
Right, to go out and, you know, we'll get you the best examples.

10:54.574 --> 10:55.375
Which is what they did.

10:55.535 --> 10:56.035
Right.

10:57.237 --> 11:04.365
But what I did was pick and choose all of my varied interests, which are very varied.

11:04.385 --> 11:05.787
And that was, that's what...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.458
But it was a high spot collection.

11:08.478 --> 11:13.729
It was a high spot collection, but there's nothing I've ever... I will not buy a book... It is a high spot collection.

11:13.749 --> 11:14.932
Yes, but let me say this to you.

11:15.132 --> 11:21.886
There isn't a book that I ever bought that I didn't have an interest in and or read.

11:22.668 --> 11:27.758
In other words, or manuscripts, whatever I've got.

11:28.362 --> 11:33.067
It was a personal collection based on the things that moved me.

11:34.669 --> 11:35.150
It wasn't?

11:35.390 --> 11:38.834
Because somebody said, if you're going to build a film noir collection, which I did build.

11:39.775 --> 11:40.436
A which?

11:40.456 --> 11:44.721
A film noir collection of motion picture scripts.

11:46.443 --> 11:50.007
And Peter Howard and company helped me build that.

11:51.289 --> 11:53.391
But everything else that I put together,

11:54.012 --> 12:02.562
was put together based on what I love, what I've read, and what I wanted the first example of.

12:02.582 --> 12:08.749
It wasn't put together because if I'm going to build a high spot collection, this is what should be in my high spot collection.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.330
There's no way.

12:09.811 --> 12:12.093
Well, I saw the film about things at the Glover Club.

12:12.113 --> 12:14.136
They were very, very, very impressive.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.177
Best, best, best.

12:15.916 --> 12:23.305
No one will ever say that whatever I put my hand to was not the best of its kind that I could afford.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.126
That's a good quote.

12:24.447 --> 12:25.088
Very important.

12:25.788 --> 12:32.337
I have never bought a second-rate object knowingly.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.119
Have you ever moved up?

12:34.960 --> 12:35.401
Of course.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.683
Of course.

12:37.744 --> 12:44.472
Where at one time I couldn't afford Chippendale furniture made by Thomas Chippendale out of his workshop.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.475
I have a separate collection of just his things.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.643
Which cost me millions to put together.

12:56.547 --> 13:00.211
Does it give you a kick to go over to the Metropolitan and see your name in a couple of rooms there?

13:00.392 --> 13:00.752
Sure it does.

13:01.613 --> 13:03.455
I would be crazy if I said no.

13:03.475 --> 13:03.736
Why?

13:04.136 --> 13:05.898
Because everybody wants a little bit of immortality.

13:07.160 --> 13:11.345
How do you reach immortality?

13:11.365 --> 13:15.150
What does life or genetics...

13:15.485 --> 13:20.630
This is a little nonsense philosophy.

13:20.650 --> 13:21.491
What's it all about?

13:23.753 --> 13:28.898
Immortality is a basic, I think, is a basic of nature.

13:31.240 --> 13:36.625
And we all strive for immortality, kings and princes and everyday people.

13:37.506 --> 13:39.448
And I'm just an everyday person.

13:39.468 --> 13:42.130
How can I reach immortality?

13:42.150 --> 13:45.053
One way is to leave my name.

13:45.775 --> 13:48.578
and that of my family, to continue.

13:49.319 --> 13:53.364
What do most men want out of life?

13:55.848 --> 14:04.839
When it comes to leaving their name to go on, this is another way of doing it.

14:05.099 --> 14:15.512
And to be able to have left a mark, to say I was here, as trite, and as...

14:15.982 --> 14:21.628
As cliched as that sounds, we all would like to say that we were here.

14:23.229 --> 14:29.316
One of the ways we can do that, aside from doing good works, is to leave a little bit of a legacy.

14:31.778 --> 14:44.571
And if I can leave my name in an institution or two, if I can put a collection or two together that moves and teaches and instructs, what's wrong with that?

14:45.091 --> 14:47.235
Let's go back to a year ago.

14:47.255 --> 14:50.700
I don't think you were collecting, but I'm just really interested.

14:51.321 --> 14:57.271
You said that there was a point where you were paying $60 a month for things, and your wife was paying $10 a week for things that you bought.

14:57.291 --> 14:58.553
Oh, exactly, because of 20 years.

14:58.734 --> 14:59.515
Yeah.

14:59.535 --> 15:09.552
But what I'm curious about is how did Richard Manning, who was paying things on $60 time, become Richard Manning, who could afford to spend $500 a year?

15:09.872 --> 15:10.373
What happened?

15:10.690 --> 15:12.092
I started to make some money.

15:12.453 --> 15:12.913
What happened?

15:12.973 --> 15:16.098
I went into business for 33 years.

15:16.138 --> 15:20.865
Tell me a little bit about the past, because I don't know that much about it.

15:21.827 --> 15:24.371
I was married in 1963.

15:24.771 --> 15:26.273
You told me.

15:28.016 --> 15:28.837
Good man, you remember me.

15:28.857 --> 15:31.281
I was married in April of 1963.

15:32.054 --> 15:37.603
I had already been in business for myself since July or June of 58.

15:38.664 --> 15:44.073
And I divested myself at that point of partners that I had.

15:46.076 --> 15:50.643
And I started to make money.

15:51.485 --> 15:51.965
Doing what?

15:53.127 --> 15:54.590
In the advertising and media world.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.853
Selling.

15:57.855 --> 15:59.918
Working for yourself or myself?

16:00.421 --> 16:05.426
I've always worked for myself since I'm 22, since 1958.

16:05.446 --> 16:12.613
And I don't want to say something about that.

16:17.758 --> 16:29.550
I started in the advertising and media world, supplying stations across the country, TV, radio stations,

16:30.020 --> 16:47.737
with incentive merchandise, which they could use to promote their stations by having giveaways, and they would pay me for this merchandise in advertising time, which I would then resell to my clients.

16:48.017 --> 16:48.798
Very interesting.

16:50.160 --> 16:50.940
Very clever.

16:51.060 --> 16:55.845
Yeah, we were the first company to start the first independent media buying operation.

16:55.865 --> 16:57.106
That's where you get to name media.

16:57.206 --> 16:57.867
Exactly.

16:58.302 --> 17:05.689
Actually, the name was Mediators, which changed to Mediators very quickly.

17:06.630 --> 17:17.361
Mediators was a name that was given to me by a friend by the name of Don Purcell, who was at the time in the jingle business.

17:18.942 --> 17:25.609
I went to Don, and I said, Don, I'm going into the business of trading merchandise with stations.

17:26.028 --> 17:52.930
acquiring media he said you are a mediator and i said son of a gun it's a hell of a word and i called myself the mediators incorporated and it wasn't three weeks after i we came up with a name and incorporated it and people looked at the spelling and said oh yes mediators and after that i was the mediators it was impossible to continue pronouncing it mediators and uh what we were

17:53.112 --> 18:03.526
were the first company that took media buying outside of the advertising agency and became the first independent company to buy and sell media.

18:04.768 --> 18:05.949
Media meaning what?

18:06.090 --> 18:08.153
Television and radio advertising.

18:08.173 --> 18:10.656
We're not talking about... 30 and 60 second commercials.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.338
Like a newspaper or a television.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.640
No, we're talking about TV and radio.

18:13.800 --> 18:19.748
Have I understood that you, somebody said that you actually brokered the sale of TV stations and newspapers or something?

18:19.768 --> 18:20.509
No, that's wrong, right?

18:20.529 --> 18:21.010
That's wrong.

18:21.682 --> 18:46.423
okay we booked the sale of the commercial time and uh we're talking about abstractions time yes uh well there are abstractions on one hand but great realities on another because when you watch a commercial for kodak or xerox or any any you know major client uh they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars depending on purchasing

18:46.640 --> 18:49.943
these 30- and 60-second commercials across the country.

18:50.764 --> 18:57.731
And what we do is we try to get them the best buys from all these stations as humanly possible.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.335
We negotiate these rates for them.

19:01.355 --> 19:09.203
And I've built that business over the last... Just out of curiosity, where do you make your buck in this?

19:09.223 --> 19:12.546
My buck is made in the difference between my cost of the advertising

19:13.032 --> 19:18.878
and what they sell it for.

19:18.898 --> 19:19.759
Very entrepreneurial.

19:21.801 --> 19:23.643
And this is our basic business.

19:23.663 --> 19:33.733
And what has happened over the years is that we offer our clients the ability to pay for that advertising, not only in cash, but with excess inventory.

19:34.354 --> 19:42.702
To give you an example, a client is sitting with excess merchandise that he's manufactured, television sets,

19:44.555 --> 19:49.823
Stereos, cars, I don't care what it is.

19:49.843 --> 20:00.460
In order for the client to sell all of these tape recorders that he's got excess in, they sell, say, for $200 a piece wholesale, let's just say.

20:00.480 --> 20:05.828
But if he's sitting with an overage of this stuff, if he wants to dump it into retail, he can't get $200 for it.

20:05.848 --> 20:07.571
He's going to have to sell it maybe for $100.

20:08.152 --> 20:08.773
Maybe less.

20:08.933 --> 20:09.634
Or maybe less.

20:10.272 --> 20:12.234
I come here and say, don't take a discount.

20:12.514 --> 20:15.478
I'll pay you $200 for it.

20:15.498 --> 20:17.340
So your books don't take a loss.

20:17.360 --> 20:23.766
But take that $200 in media credits, not in cash.

20:23.907 --> 20:24.427
Very good.

20:25.268 --> 20:26.930
That's my business.

20:26.950 --> 20:27.971
I love it.

20:28.051 --> 20:28.892
You came up with this.

20:28.912 --> 20:29.152
Yes.

20:29.433 --> 20:32.496
That's what I do for that.

20:32.536 --> 20:35.059
But when times become tough, as they are now.

20:35.099 --> 20:39.503
When times become tough, advertisers cut their budgets, and so everybody gets hurt a little bit.

20:39.523 --> 20:40.144
But, you know.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.761
It's just cyclical.

20:41.861 --> 20:43.102
It's happened to us three times.

20:43.383 --> 20:45.905
Do you expect that this will watch out?

20:45.945 --> 20:46.305
Oh, it's old.

20:46.325 --> 20:49.248
Within the next year or two, we're going to be back bigger and better than ever.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.410
And we've seen this happen three times before.

20:52.391 --> 20:56.555
You have tremendous... Pardon me.

20:56.575 --> 20:58.897
I think it's in the American economy.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.559
There's no question about that.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.625
I still believe as the world goes... As the world goes, so does America.

21:07.645 --> 21:09.186
As America goes, so does the world.

21:09.453 --> 21:10.855
I don't care about Japan.

21:10.915 --> 21:14.099
I don't care about anybody else.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.781
A lot of other people care about Japan.

21:15.982 --> 21:22.851
That's marvelous, but I will tell you that America is the deciding factor.

21:25.674 --> 21:39.072
If we were to have a very negative cash problem over an extended period of time, it would affect the entire world.

21:40.722 --> 21:44.587
Do you agree with the estimates that we have 10 years to get our act in order?

21:45.929 --> 21:46.130
No.

21:47.171 --> 21:50.075
I think... I shouldn't say that.

21:50.135 --> 21:52.518
You're saying we have 10 years to get our act in order?

21:52.578 --> 21:52.659
Yes.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.762
I've never heard that expression before, but I think you're right.

21:55.202 --> 21:57.545
I think we've got 10 years to get our act in order.

21:57.565 --> 22:01.591
I think if we continue down this road for the next 10 years, the way we're going is not good.

22:02.392 --> 22:06.958
But right now, we are the absolute deciding factor of how the world goes.

22:07.599 --> 22:10.223
We're still the biggest and largest economy in the world.

22:10.456 --> 22:25.858
And as much as Japan has all the banking and all the cash flow at this point, without American business, without American finance, without American trade, the world will fall apart.

22:26.258 --> 22:28.742
Ten years from now, it's going to be a totally different subject.

22:29.202 --> 22:32.867
But I believe we're going to pick up and wake up in very short order.

22:35.651 --> 22:40.378
I'm one of the three, four or five most important book collectors at the time

22:40.898 --> 22:43.141
that we're talking about right now.

22:43.161 --> 22:53.353
Yet, you must understand that in the whole oeuvre of my collection, the whole meaning of my collection is 5% of what I collect.

22:54.594 --> 22:58.158
And that you will see when you come to the house.

22:58.178 --> 22:58.419
Question.

22:58.439 --> 22:58.659
Go ahead.

23:02.584 --> 23:04.045
Yes.

23:04.065 --> 23:04.806
Go for it.

23:04.846 --> 23:05.107
Go ahead.

23:05.687 --> 23:06.768
Ask a question.

23:06.788 --> 23:09.792
Some people have suggested that you're the Donald Trump of the book world.

23:10.868 --> 23:15.694
I don't know whether to be flattered or not to be, but I will tell you this.

23:16.495 --> 23:21.520
The people who really know me know that I am not a flash in the pan.

23:22.502 --> 23:30.351
For 28 years we've put together collections and given them away, and therefore it belies any statement to that effect.

23:31.933 --> 23:38.260
The reason for the sale of the books is because of some immediate cash needs, as we talked about prior to this.

23:39.455 --> 23:44.962
And books are something I can realize the right amount of money on based on the true value.

23:45.563 --> 23:55.575
But more importantly, I'm flattered that I've even been able to make the kind of a mark with some of my enemies who are so jealous as to want to relate to me to Donald Trump.

23:55.975 --> 24:00.501
I take that as a compliment and I would very much want you to keep that in the book.
