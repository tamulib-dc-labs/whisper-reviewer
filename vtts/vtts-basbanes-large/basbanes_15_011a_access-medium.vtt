WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:14.615
Morris, in reading about your biography, especially in the PW interview that you did a couple years ago.

00:14.955 --> 00:26.370
You're from Vermont, and apparently you had a difficult childhood, but a modest childhood.

00:27.172 --> 00:31.337
Can we, is it a superficial conclusion that

00:31.891 --> 00:35.795
There's a lot of autobiographical resonance in this novel.

00:35.815 --> 00:48.787
Well, the characters are certainly close to my family, and the circumstances are similar.

00:49.347 --> 00:51.970
My mother and father were divorced.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.913
My mother raised us.

00:55.273 --> 00:59.297
I have three brothers in the book.

00:59.317 --> 01:00.598
There are two brothers.

01:01.473 --> 01:06.200
for a number of years.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.325
Things were very tight and difficult in the family.

01:11.607 --> 01:13.230
So it's close that way.

01:13.250 --> 01:19.979
I've read where you start generally with characters or stories.

01:19.999 --> 01:23.504
Are you more plot-driven or character-driven?

01:23.524 --> 01:26.068
They're really close for me.

01:28.331 --> 01:29.252
I know plot is

01:29.519 --> 01:33.485
very much a dirty word with a lot of people, but it isn't with me.

01:33.865 --> 01:38.732
It's really important, and so are the characters.

01:39.593 --> 01:40.875
Okay, can you hear me now?

01:40.895 --> 01:43.699
The characters, that's the most important thing.

01:44.921 --> 01:49.467
Yeah, this is a big, about 700 pages?

01:49.487 --> 01:51.410
Yeah, 740-something.

01:51.430 --> 01:53.012
It's pretty good.

01:53.332 --> 01:58.800
I mean, your first two books were not nearly as large as the... No, I...

01:59.557 --> 02:25.530
I knew once I got started that it was going to be long, but no, I didn't start out with that in mind at all.

02:26.253 --> 02:29.278
Well, I haven't counted.

02:29.338 --> 02:32.342
Now, someone somewhere did write that.

02:32.522 --> 02:34.746
I forgot where that was.

02:34.766 --> 02:45.242
Yeah, I'd seen that, so I'm not sure how accurate that is, but it doesn't surprise me that there are that many.

02:46.724 --> 02:55.517
I also understand that you're kind of vital with the suggestion that you write about the misfits in society.

02:55.919 --> 03:03.690
But it is clear, however, that you do write about the less advantaged, so to speak.

03:03.710 --> 03:12.122
Could you just explain a little bit about your interest in the kinds of characters that you write about?

03:12.142 --> 03:17.970
Well, I can see where people would say that with the book Vanished.

03:18.451 --> 03:21.235
Certainly, Aubrey Wallace was a misfit.

03:21.873 --> 03:26.359
A dangerous woman the main character certainly was, Martha Horgan.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.525
And I didn't use the word misfit, by the way, but others have.

03:31.487 --> 03:31.627
Uh-huh.

03:32.188 --> 03:33.369
No, I understand that.

03:34.932 --> 03:39.298
But to suggest that that's all, you know— No, I would never suggest that.

03:39.538 --> 03:40.139
Certainly you are.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.625
I see kind of a—are you familiar with William Kennedy's work?

03:44.665 --> 03:44.986
Uh-huh.

03:45.186 --> 03:47.029
You know his book, Iron Weed?

03:47.149 --> 03:47.890
Uh-huh.

03:47.910 --> 03:51.475
There's an interesting parallel with that book.

03:52.113 --> 04:01.825
And he had published three or four books prior to that, but he couldn't have a life with him to get that book published by anybody.

04:01.945 --> 04:17.884
And what he said was, everybody indicated to him, who's interested in a bunch of low-lives, people who live in the gutter, people who are former alcoholics, who's interested in these people?

04:18.421 --> 04:28.775
Fortunately for him, Saul Bellow wrote to Viking, and they gave another one, and I think it's one of the great books, you know, certainly over the last 20 black years.

04:28.795 --> 04:41.872
But do you sense that people are not necessarily interested in the kinds, not interested, but it's hard to generate empathy for characters on the stage?

04:41.893 --> 04:47.500
Well, I think the natural impulse for

04:48.104 --> 05:14.820
readers for most people and most things is to want to be happy and want to escape from their problems and even in their reading and so if the characters are people with a lot of problems I can understand why a reader wouldn't necessarily want to

05:16.049 --> 05:18.331
go looking for a book like that.

05:20.773 --> 05:34.426
Especially this book, I don't see that the characters are primarily fringe people, the way the others are.

05:34.686 --> 05:44.976
They're certainly experiencing difficult times, to be sure.

05:45.547 --> 05:57.445
The central character certainly is not living a much life by any means, and there's certainly a lot of stress.

06:00.550 --> 06:09.563
But I found that struggle that that character, Marie Fermoil, I found that a fascinating struggle.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.916
How was it that you chose 1960 as a summer?

06:13.936 --> 06:21.524
Well, that was easy, because in the summer of 1960, I was just graduating from high school myself.

06:21.544 --> 06:27.871
I was seventeen, and I knew that time.

06:28.412 --> 06:40.765
And I really do feel that it was an easier time in many respects.

06:41.386 --> 07:09.317
I saw it as a real challenge on the one hand and also as a good

07:10.478 --> 07:16.785
structurally a good way to do it because it kept the story tight.

07:16.805 --> 07:30.461
It kept the focus on Marie Fermoil's goal to get this daughter into school, and that's primarily why.

07:30.742 --> 07:36.148
A couple of your critics currently have pointed out that

07:36.382 --> 07:38.826
It is kind of a thriller.

07:38.846 --> 07:47.458
There is an element in here that does keep the reader involved as to what's going on.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.842
Did you see this also as a kind of a thriller?

07:50.563 --> 07:54.809
Well, that's always, again, to use the word challenge.

07:55.550 --> 08:05.224
With the other two books as well, it has always seemed to me that you could write a very serious book.

08:05.913 --> 08:08.095
and still make it entertaining.

08:08.636 --> 08:16.283
You could still completely engage the reader if you did it well.

08:17.324 --> 08:25.753
With the three books, do you see any interrelated, do you see an inconsistency, a thematic consistency for you?

08:25.773 --> 08:33.000
Is it a business, in fact, a body of work for you, a corpus, or do you use the wrong words?

08:34.010 --> 08:40.118
I wouldn't dare do that.

08:40.398 --> 08:45.885
I think I'd be afraid I'd get too close to the flame and blow it out or something.

08:45.985 --> 08:46.886
I don't know.

08:47.547 --> 09:02.025
But there are certainly themes that you're concerned with.

09:02.647 --> 09:04.169
And see, I think of people.

09:04.310 --> 09:18.211
I go to, I find people's loneliness and yearning for love and the cruelties that people inflict upon one another.

09:18.231 --> 09:23.198
Those are, that interest me.

09:23.218 --> 09:26.664
And I don't really think in terms of themes.

09:28.647 --> 09:29.548
I read that

09:30.912 --> 09:50.775
I wish more authors did that, you know, that little statement of what the authors did.

09:50.795 --> 09:52.737
I wish I had a good question.

09:52.757 --> 09:56.802
But you use words with such as frailty and love.

09:57.305 --> 10:20.110
Well, it was primarily in the—that began with how the book was structured in that it had no—there are no chapters in the book.

10:20.370 --> 10:25.776
It's just really a series of one scene.

10:26.414 --> 10:29.037
blending into another scene.

10:30.859 --> 10:52.405
The different voices were very important to me that each scene, each character, would be written in the tone of the character's voice and the manner of the character's thoughts.

10:54.342 --> 10:57.587
I didn't want chapters that had titles.

10:57.647 --> 11:08.004
I wanted a sense for the reader that he was just kind of in this and swept along through it.

11:08.024 --> 11:10.648
Do you rewrite a lot?

11:10.668 --> 11:12.972
Yes, uh-huh.

11:12.992 --> 11:16.778
I think this is, what, 44 years between books?

11:17.059 --> 11:18.160
I think it's 88, 91.

11:18.441 --> 11:21.666
Yes, between publishing, uh-huh.

11:22.945 --> 11:26.291
Did this one take you longer to write, more time to write?

11:26.933 --> 11:36.390
Yeah, this took me twice as long as far as the length of hours in a day.

11:36.431 --> 11:41.460
You find that there's also the intensity of you.

11:41.930 --> 11:52.668
Yes, because there were so many characters and so many stories, I had to stay with it much more.

11:52.688 --> 12:04.647
I couldn't, even going away on a trip was difficult because when I came back, I'd have to completely reacquaint myself, start over almost.

12:04.998 --> 12:12.267
And the longer I was away, it was just so hard getting back to it.

12:12.287 --> 12:14.650
Do you live these books while you're writing them?

12:15.090 --> 12:17.613
I suppose, in a sense, yeah.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.576
Do you wake up with solutions to problems?

12:19.996 --> 12:21.078
Oh, yeah, all of that.

12:21.138 --> 12:29.067
Wake up with solutions, hear the voices in my head, walk along, realize that I'm kind of talking to myself.

12:29.087 --> 12:32.912
But so many of these characters, I really...

12:33.635 --> 12:38.402
I mean, they were original, the 51-year-old twins.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.425
Oh, yeah, the Manka twins.

12:40.605 --> 12:40.805
Uh-huh.

12:40.885 --> 12:47.595
You know, you have priests and police chief office.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.377
Is this a little town?

12:49.918 --> 12:54.585
Of course, it is a fictional town, I believe.

12:54.705 --> 12:55.967
It's not an actual town.

12:55.987 --> 12:56.908
Jacksonville, Vermont, isn't it now?

12:57.293 --> 13:00.296
I guess there's an Athens in New Hampshire, but I've never been there.

13:01.637 --> 13:08.923
Well, yes, it's geographically set up much the way my hometown of Rutland, Vermont was.

13:09.063 --> 13:12.966
Well, pretty close to Rutland, I think.

13:12.986 --> 13:19.211
Yes, except that, of course, Rutland is the second largest city in Vermont.

13:19.231 --> 13:23.115
It would be larger than no one refers to Rutland.

13:24.376 --> 13:27.098
No one in that area refers to Rutland as a town.

13:27.196 --> 13:34.345
But they think of themselves as a city by these standards here, around here, of course, as a town.

13:35.166 --> 13:42.596
Yeah, but Rutland is a city, and I apologize for writing a simple word.

13:42.616 --> 13:54.351
I don't mean to use the other observations of other reviewers, but I noticed one said that you're thieves of Catholicism.

13:54.871 --> 14:05.045
Are these, in fact, the kinds of areas that you wanted to pursue?

14:08.029 --> 14:13.337
They were just what the story was about, you know.

14:13.938 --> 14:16.722
No, I didn't set out to attack Catholicism.

14:16.822 --> 14:17.302
I didn't .

14:17.322 --> 14:17.342
.

14:17.362 --> 14:17.623
.

14:17.643 --> 14:20.226
Well, I didn't use the word .

14:20.547 --> 14:20.587
.

14:20.607 --> 14:20.827
.

14:21.168 --> 14:23.511
No, but it's been

14:24.031 --> 14:28.556
pointed out to me and suggested that that's what I've done.

14:29.337 --> 14:40.769
And no, I just, for me, the person as Father Gannon was first and foremost a troubled young man.

14:41.130 --> 14:50.680
And of course what that does when one is a priest, how that can mess a lot of things up.

14:50.963 --> 14:56.672
The issue of poverty is, again, just there.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.855
It's just part of what that story's about.

14:59.716 --> 15:10.152
Do you think that this really, that poverty or any other kind of hardship, does test the middle of a person, you know, the character?

15:10.172 --> 15:11.034
Oh, definitely.

15:11.314 --> 15:11.695
Definitely.

15:11.715 --> 15:17.083
Maybe there's another reason why you choose to write about people under stress.

15:17.103 --> 15:18.245
I don't know.

15:18.265 --> 15:18.405
Mm-hmm.

15:20.174 --> 15:33.534
Well, of course, it's just maybe the thing that, because I grew up with it, I'm more familiar with it.

15:34.695 --> 15:36.538
I'm certainly comfortable with it, though.

15:37.520 --> 15:48.055
You know, I noticed that, just like Mary Gordon has told me, and I've read a number of books, she feels so uncomfortable writing about men.

15:48.878 --> 15:53.246
You don't seem to have that problem at all, I mean, by the way.

15:53.267 --> 15:54.048
Oh, no, I don't.

15:54.850 --> 16:00.901
And I wonder why, especially with your personal contact with the central character.

16:00.921 --> 16:02.925
With the man, uh-huh.

16:02.945 --> 16:04.528
That didn't intimidate you at all?

16:05.691 --> 16:08.997
No, it didn't until afterwards it was pointed out to me that it was...

16:09.196 --> 16:14.582
that I certainly had a lot of nerve doing it.

16:14.642 --> 16:17.366
And I said, well, maybe you're right.

16:20.129 --> 16:24.234
No, it didn't occur to me that I didn't see that.

16:25.415 --> 16:35.427
To me, the challenge there was to tell that story through a very limited perspective of that particular character, not that he was male.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.410
Artistically, was this book...

16:38.845 --> 17:03.300
I knew I wanted to tell a particular story that had many aspects, many other stories as part of it.

17:04.282 --> 17:08.127
The particular story being the story of the Fremoyle family.

17:08.765 --> 17:27.930
And so for that reason, once I got started, yes, it was very much a challenge to keep all the voices straight and to make every story matter in relation to the main story.

17:30.654 --> 17:32.777
Do you write in the work process?

17:32.797 --> 17:35.380
Yes, I do now.

17:35.748 --> 17:39.492
There's no way of knowing how many drafts there are of this book, right?

17:40.092 --> 17:40.753
Right, right.

17:40.893 --> 17:47.139
But I have a couple of huge boxes filled.

17:47.299 --> 17:52.084
The manuscript was 1,200 pages, so just printing.

17:52.104 --> 18:02.734
I'm sure you know then that every time it came off the word process, there it was.

18:03.490 --> 18:10.922
And in fact, you know, the metaphor is always a baby, you know, giving birth.

18:11.063 --> 18:11.243
Yeah.

18:11.784 --> 18:13.407
And it weighed, in fact, nine pounds.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.650
I'll never forget to actually weigh the manuscript.

18:15.670 --> 18:19.076
Yeah.

18:19.096 --> 18:25.647
It's not an easy thing to... Now, did you take yours with you when you would travel or... See, I would never do that.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.470
There was too much to it.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.734
In my case, I love...

18:30.322 --> 18:36.592
Luke Gingrich, for instance, remember he was talking about this book, and he was welcome to the yard with his last thought.

18:36.612 --> 18:38.054
He banged away.

18:38.074 --> 18:45.405
I mean, my research fills this room for me to go and really work on something.

18:45.426 --> 18:46.748
Now you have to teach.

18:47.649 --> 18:51.535
There are pages where I might have different references.

18:51.555 --> 18:56.683
It is a non-fiction book, but I really just wrote entirely in my little book.

18:57.254 --> 18:59.737
Yeah, you'd have to.

18:59.757 --> 19:02.059
It wasn't just coming off the top of your head.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.864
Every one was opening, every sentence was opening up.

19:09.566 --> 19:23.821
Just about all of the feature stories that have been written about you, the consistent theme is how you wrote in secrecy for all those years.

19:23.881 --> 19:24.882
And it is interesting.

19:25.891 --> 19:31.718
being a journalist, we jump on things like this, but did you, in fact, write in secrecy?

19:31.738 --> 19:32.739
I really did.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.722
It is fascinating.

19:34.842 --> 19:45.295
I'm sorry to cover ground, but a lot of the papers I write for have never had features on you before, so we will revisit some of the areas if it's okay with you.

19:46.196 --> 19:47.217
Oh, yes.

19:47.417 --> 19:55.527
I don't have a problem admitting to my fetish now, but no, I was

19:57.481 --> 20:26.560
unable to tell people it was part of it I think was because I wasn't published it seemed that to say I was writing people would think I was like everyone else who's writing and I think I feared that maybe I was like that too that I was just

20:27.333 --> 20:30.698
I'd like to read, therefore I thought I could write.

20:30.798 --> 20:40.854
And if I told people I wrote, then I was going to have to answer the question of, well, have you ever had anything published?

20:40.914 --> 20:42.777
Have you tried to have anything published?

20:43.158 --> 20:51.130
And it was just all too painful at that time to always be rejected whenever I sent anything out.

20:52.072 --> 20:59.902
It was so much easier just to not talk about it and not, you know, to just do it quietly.

20:59.962 --> 21:04.928
And you were acting as your own agent.

21:04.968 --> 21:05.609
Oh, yes.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.853
Sending it out to just a name.

21:08.993 --> 21:15.801
I didn't know if the editor's name I had loved science fiction and hated everything else.

21:16.321 --> 21:19.225
So you never went to LMP to look at the names?

21:19.405 --> 21:20.907
Well, yes, I did.

21:20.987 --> 21:28.456
But again, you don't get a huge amount of information about particular editors or anything.

21:28.476 --> 21:30.639
So the break was getting an agent.

21:30.659 --> 21:39.750
The break was exactly getting an agent, and her knowing which editor would like the type of work I was doing.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.752
That was the difference.

21:41.793 --> 21:45.417
That's wonderful that she liked the book, too.

21:45.717 --> 21:50.922
It was pretty amazing that she liked the book, because nobody else did.

21:51.103 --> 21:58.250
Was that, in fact, the first book that you had been working on over the twenty years of secrecy?

21:58.290 --> 21:59.952
Were there many books?

21:59.972 --> 22:14.847
Well, there were many different things that I had been writing, but that was the first book that I was determined that I would send out, and that I had worked on so much that I had

22:15.097 --> 22:21.523
I finished it, and I knew it was complete, and I knew there was nothing more that could or had to be done on it.

22:22.323 --> 22:27.728
And did it, in fact, get published pretty much the way you submitted it?

22:27.768 --> 22:28.569
Just about.

22:29.470 --> 22:30.231
Yeah, it is.

22:30.551 --> 22:33.033
It's really amazing to me.

22:33.153 --> 22:36.196
Does it feel a validation?

22:38.918 --> 22:44.023
I guess I'm superstitious enough not to feel too much of one.

22:44.746 --> 22:53.456
I'm just very grateful that it finally did happen or I'd still be writing away secretly, probably.

22:53.476 --> 22:54.438
Would you think you would still be writing away?

22:54.498 --> 22:55.178
I think so.

22:55.238 --> 23:02.407
I think I'd be extremely unhappy, though, because I was getting deeper and deeper into my unhappiness.

23:03.909 --> 23:11.698
It's very bewildering to do some one thing over and over again and not have anyone

23:12.202 --> 23:13.504
want it or like it.

23:13.724 --> 23:20.514
What was your family's reaction to your episode?

23:20.534 --> 23:21.615
Very supportive.

23:21.775 --> 23:38.459
My husband always was, and when I was most down about the whole thing, he would always seem to say the right thing, and the children were too.

23:38.539 --> 23:42.124
As they got older, they would see that I—because sometimes I

23:42.408 --> 23:51.740
There was one instance where I had a very devastating reply to the book, suggesting that it was just terrible work.

23:54.884 --> 23:57.708
So they were old enough to say nice things.

24:01.973 --> 24:07.420
Your views pretty much are always very positive.

24:08.294 --> 24:10.116
But are you thin-skinned, and how do you respond?

24:10.136 --> 24:12.619
Yes, I'm very thin-skinned.

24:12.639 --> 24:15.502
I mean, does it drive you crazy the way it drives me?

24:15.522 --> 24:27.716
And I think you can fume—not fume, but you can—how somebody can dismiss something in 200 words that somebody has been eight or nine years working on?

24:28.917 --> 24:36.225
I don't think that there's much kindness that goes into it.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.143
writing a review when you can do that to someone.

24:39.163 --> 24:51.017
It always seemed to me that if you're going to—really, those kinds of reviews probably should be left to professional critics.

24:51.177 --> 24:54.661
I can't imagine one writer doing that to another writer.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.383
I'll never understand it.

24:56.543 --> 24:59.366
As long as I live, I will never understand it.

24:59.386 --> 25:02.550
I know, as a book review editor,

25:03.188 --> 25:08.157
You know, I must have edited 5,000 reviews over the years.

25:08.177 --> 25:10.761
And I would just never publish a mocking review.

25:10.941 --> 25:15.089
I mean, if you're not supposed to say you'll kill, I would kill the reviewer.

25:15.109 --> 25:19.035
I'd call the reviewer and say, I just can't publish this.

25:19.055 --> 25:20.558
You're mocking this.

25:20.578 --> 25:22.621
If you don't like the book, fine.

25:23.703 --> 25:26.428
I'd say so in a respectful way.

25:27.117 --> 25:32.506
Nothing outrages me more than a review of the flux per person.

25:32.527 --> 25:37.736
I mean, if you have problems with it, express those problems in an expectful way.

25:37.956 --> 25:47.573
I thought maybe I'd like to speak to myself in the right way, but I think you know what I'm about.

25:49.527 --> 25:55.856
I don't know what to call it, the brouhaha tempest between Winston Groom and Michiko Kakutani.

25:55.976 --> 25:56.777
Oh, I've missed that.

25:56.797 --> 25:57.979
I'm following that.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.381
It's very interesting.

25:59.441 --> 26:03.106
Her parody is... Oh, I read the parody.

26:03.447 --> 26:04.288
Oh, yeah.

26:04.909 --> 26:14.623
Yes, he's been in the news a couple of times with his comments about her review.

26:14.806 --> 26:17.430
personal text from him?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.234
From him, he directed it.

26:21.115 --> 26:38.640
Yeah, he was quoted as saying that it was a mean-spirited review, it was cruel, scathing, and that the difficulty was that there's really not much a writer can do when someone sets out to destroy them like that.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.083
In his case, though, there's a lot of...

26:43.257 --> 26:55.292
There's no question that he was cashing in on the liberty of this movie, too, I mean.

26:55.312 --> 26:55.893
The popularity of Boris Gump.

26:55.913 --> 26:58.716
You know, I don't imagine the thing could have hurt.

26:58.736 --> 27:01.039
I mean, it wasn't even in the back of the section.

27:01.059 --> 27:03.722
It jumped on the front page of the section.

27:03.743 --> 27:04.704
Really?

27:05.565 --> 27:06.746
I didn't read the parody.

27:06.766 --> 27:08.168
I've only read his...

27:08.468 --> 27:28.373
I have no problems saying in print how despicable I am, but Madonna's book was.

27:28.393 --> 27:30.396
You can't even look at it in the bookstore.

27:30.476 --> 27:34.921
They had plastic on it.

27:34.941 --> 27:37.885
It was clearly an exploitive thing.

27:38.253 --> 28:01.659
The book, of course, speaks for itself, and you'll forgive me if we really haven't talked about it, but it's my job to read it and talk about it, and I do try and combine .

28:01.719 --> 28:01.819
.

28:01.879 --> 28:06.825
.

28:07.210 --> 28:07.651
Oh.

28:07.671 --> 28:13.958
A little feature kind of thing.

28:14.018 --> 28:16.862
I think your writing is extremely fun.

28:16.982 --> 28:17.943
Oh, thanks, Nick.

28:18.323 --> 28:18.944
Thank you so much.

28:20.185 --> 28:33.201
I normally can read very quickly if I have to, but there are times when you want to slow down a little bit and enjoy it.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.011
I've seen two numbers.

28:39.312 --> 28:42.918
Advantage was rejected 20 times, is that right, or 27 times?

28:42.998 --> 28:45.823
I think it was 27, something like that, yeah.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.448
And you never gave up.

28:48.468 --> 28:52.115
That's really... Well, I came close.

28:52.275 --> 28:53.758
I mean, I really did.

28:53.858 --> 29:01.872
I actually had declared that I would never send it out again and went through the...

29:04.147 --> 29:09.693
formality of putting it in a box and taping it up and putting it up on a shelf.

29:12.416 --> 29:25.229
Because every time it came back, it hurt the writing I was doing, because it made me wonder why I was doing this, why I was bothering.

29:25.349 --> 29:31.015
Was it ever close to being picked up?

29:32.777 --> 29:32.837
No.

29:32.817 --> 29:56.361
Yes, and I wish I could think of, there was an editor of New York Times Book Review, and I cannot think of his name, and a relative of mine had met him and had told him about the book, and he said, oh, he was just fascinated, and he said, well, I know...

29:56.712 --> 29:58.435
two people, and I'm going to send the name.

29:58.495 --> 30:01.339
I wish I could think of his name.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.104
Two days later, he was hit by a car.

30:04.685 --> 30:06.989
That was about the close.

30:07.049 --> 30:09.513
He was hit by a car in New York City.

30:09.793 --> 30:15.362
It was a terrible tragedy on every level.

30:15.612 --> 30:19.498
So what was your reaction finally when your agent called?

30:22.402 --> 30:29.633
In the very end when she, it was just like a college acceptance in a way, the reverse.

30:29.653 --> 30:38.627
So because it was a thin letter, I knew I wasn't getting the manuscript back.

30:38.647 --> 30:42.413
So we had many stages in this process where she was looking at the

30:42.713 --> 30:54.806
And the last letter she sent, because it was just a thin envelope, I just knew before I opened it that she was going to take the book.

30:55.006 --> 30:58.289
My reaction was just to call everyone I knew.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.172
Well, everyone who knew I was writing, not everyone I knew.

31:01.713 --> 31:08.620
Then that was an interesting process to go through to tell people.

31:09.646 --> 31:14.831
So what was the response of all these people who didn't know you were writing?

31:15.132 --> 31:16.974
That was difficult for many people.

31:17.034 --> 31:30.087
They were very pleased for me, but it was hard when you think you know someone and when you've gotten close to someone and there's this whole aspect of them that they haven't shared with you.

31:30.147 --> 31:35.212
I'll tell you you did it the right way when we're done.

31:35.232 --> 31:37.695
I'll tell you a little bit of my history, which is

31:38.738 --> 31:46.710
I have your phone number in case I have any questions.

31:46.730 --> 31:47.271
Oh, sure.

31:47.291 --> 31:52.599
I'll transcribe it tomorrow, and if you don't mind, I'll give you a call.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.240
Oh, no.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.164
I'm leaving Sunday on the book tour.

31:56.325 --> 31:58.087
That's the only thing.

31:58.288 --> 32:01.433
Where are you going?

32:01.693 --> 32:07.041
New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Seattle, things.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.955
Chicago.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.478
Are you going to Minneapolis?

32:11.498 --> 32:11.719
Yeah.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.541
Are you doing any interviews out there?

32:13.681 --> 32:20.210
So Minneapolis takes me every once in a while if I have something in particular interest.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.915
I may, I'm not sure if I have an interview.

32:23.956 --> 32:24.997
I've got to check that.

32:25.037 --> 32:26.960
I'll check it out.

32:28.281 --> 32:28.802
Don't worry about that.

32:28.822 --> 32:32.067
You are in New England all along your life, is that right?

32:32.087 --> 32:34.971
Yeah, born in Connecticut and raised in Vermont.

32:34.991 --> 32:35.471
Where in Connecticut?

32:35.491 --> 32:36.032
Meriden.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.926
Because I have New London and Manchester, too.

32:39.507 --> 32:40.428
Oh, really?

32:40.728 --> 32:42.450
No, I was— You were born in Merida?

32:42.811 --> 32:45.433
Born in Merida, my mother and father.

32:45.453 --> 32:48.236
My father was working there during the war years.

32:48.657 --> 32:52.041
He was working one of those plants down there.

32:52.081 --> 32:58.187
Well, Merida's not far from Manchester, right?

32:58.207 --> 32:58.888
I love that.

32:58.908 --> 32:59.929
Is that New London paper?

33:00.530 --> 33:02.712
I'm so pleased to be in that.

33:02.759 --> 33:03.560
Really?

33:03.700 --> 33:06.903
Yeah, it's owned by a trust for the employees.

33:07.884 --> 33:10.086
You know, it's only 40,000 or 50,000 in circulation.

33:10.106 --> 33:13.469
They can indulge themselves in a call, and they love it.

33:14.110 --> 33:14.811
Oh, that's great.

33:16.072 --> 33:20.236
If I can give them a little local flavor, I'll do it.

33:20.256 --> 33:26.242
And then, when did you move up to Vermont?

33:26.482 --> 33:27.443
As a child.

33:28.604 --> 33:31.467
We also lived in Brooklyn, New York.

33:32.105 --> 33:45.538
Maybe three years, again, during the years when there was a lot of, my father then was, Borum and Peas was the company he worked for in Brooklyn, New York.

33:45.558 --> 33:57.910
And then from there, when I was about, my parents separated when we lived in Brooklyn, and so I went back to Vermont about the age of five or six.

33:59.020 --> 34:03.106
For a year I was sent back and lived with a relative, though.

34:03.286 --> 34:05.790
I didn't—things were difficult.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.512
Do you basically consider yourself from Vermont?

34:08.073 --> 34:10.537
Because that's what I—yeah.

34:11.558 --> 34:19.850
Does this sensibility work itself into your fiction, would you say, this regional affinity?

34:21.533 --> 34:23.295
Well, certainly New England does.

34:23.916 --> 34:25.298
Yeah, it's certainly—

34:26.071 --> 34:28.154
And is your husband from New Orleans?

34:28.174 --> 34:28.554
He is.

34:28.655 --> 34:34.843
He grew up in Lawrence at Mance, and we live in the next town over now, Andover.

34:36.265 --> 34:36.926
He's an attorney?

34:37.106 --> 34:40.291
Yeah, his office is right around the corner from the house.

34:43.475 --> 34:45.638
And you met him?

34:45.658 --> 34:52.548
I was working one summer—it was the summer of my senior year in high school—at Hampton Beach.

34:52.888 --> 34:54.711
I met him.

34:54.944 --> 34:57.507
I was probably going to go to Hampton Beach at the same time.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.871
Yeah, the summer of 1960 we met.

34:59.891 --> 35:04.537
Well, I graduated high school in 61, and we used to go to Hampton Beach.

35:04.557 --> 35:05.398
Oh, yeah.

35:05.899 --> 35:09.063
That's a great place to go then, wasn't it, huh?

35:09.704 --> 35:10.285
You haven't?

35:10.886 --> 35:11.587
I really haven't.

35:11.607 --> 35:14.050
I've gone to the Cape.

35:14.283 --> 35:16.446
I haven't.

35:16.467 --> 35:17.688
It's a different place.

35:18.209 --> 35:20.473
It was a good high school hangout someplace.

35:20.493 --> 35:20.974
It was.

35:20.994 --> 35:26.082
I went to a college up in Maine.

35:27.685 --> 35:29.107
Oh, my niece is there now.

35:29.267 --> 35:35.397
In fact, my Greek sister-in-law, their daughter is there, Penny.

35:36.338 --> 35:38.801
See, either one of my daughters want to go there.

35:40.142 --> 35:41.283
Yeah.

35:41.404 --> 35:42.465
No, she loves it.

35:42.605 --> 35:52.035
Melanie's a very bright girl, and she's happy there.

35:53.357 --> 36:00.144
I'll tell you, it's always great.

36:00.404 --> 36:00.745
Mm-hmm.

36:02.066 --> 36:03.848
I'll be back about...

36:04.300 --> 36:08.425
For good, I'll be back October 2nd or 3rd, something like that.

36:08.445 --> 36:09.766
So you're going to be back for a little while?

36:10.347 --> 36:29.129
Yes, but if you did need to call me or anything, yeah, Patty Kelly would, yeah, and she would... I think that we pretty much have anything that you feel I should have that I don't.

36:29.149 --> 36:29.590
I will.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.354
How about the character of Omar?

36:33.374 --> 36:34.155
You talked about a predator, right now.

36:35.367 --> 36:56.751
Well, he was a character that, of course, I started with a Fermoil family and just knew them instantly, especially the character of my own father who was alcoholic, so the character of Sam Fermoil I knew so well.

36:58.053 --> 37:04.140
But the minute I had Omar Duval, I was fascinated.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.121
I felt myself

37:06.198 --> 37:08.621
in his spell almost.

37:09.522 --> 37:23.116
I was very fascinated by him and began to wonder, was he in me, was I in him?

37:23.156 --> 37:27.481
There's also a biblical texture to it, isn't it?

37:27.501 --> 37:30.484
He does come and he almost is.

37:31.628 --> 37:37.154
Well, and he just knows what everyone needs.

37:37.234 --> 37:37.815
He knows.

37:38.555 --> 37:40.758
And yet he has so many of his own needs.

37:42.580 --> 37:49.187
He has the need to be recognized and to be loved and to be successful himself.

37:49.287 --> 37:52.050
And he just believes.

37:52.150 --> 37:59.678
When he ever meets Roy Gold, he just totally believes in the whole presto soap.

37:59.860 --> 38:18.003
package, and you would think that he wouldn't, but having— So you suggest that this character almost kind of took possession of you with some— I mean, I don't want to make it too— Well, but he— He affected you.

38:21.367 --> 38:25.733
He was a very easy character to write.

38:26.320 --> 38:36.130
As easy as the family members, he did speak to me.

38:36.710 --> 38:39.113
I really enjoyed him as a character.

38:39.133 --> 38:44.838
Is he just a character, or does he represent something for you?

38:44.858 --> 38:54.808
I think what he came to represent, as I wrote it, was that wish, that hope that we always have.

38:55.463 --> 39:03.731
someone will come and change our lives, whether it's the lottery ticket.

39:04.091 --> 39:17.664
You know, you walk out of the store with the lottery ticket in your pocket and you think, whoa, I don't have to worry about much anymore as soon as I have my million dollars.

39:21.127 --> 39:22.408
For me?

39:23.669 --> 39:24.610
I was

39:25.838 --> 39:55.558
I viewed Marie with a great deal of admiration and tenderness that she was so desirous of her children's success and that they be good people that she was willing to give up just about everything and anything but of course

39:56.213 --> 40:07.829
It gets complicated when Omar devolves into her life because he represents both what she wants and what she's been willing to give up, too.

40:20.887 --> 40:23.250
Would you kindly inscribe this for me?

40:24.260 --> 40:35.596
Oh, I wrote this art from Yankee Magazine in front of me on the wall.

40:35.617 --> 40:38.300
And we're talking about the dust jacket for the station.

40:39.542 --> 40:39.642
Yeah.

40:40.223 --> 40:52.461
And when the time came for the suggestions for the cover art, the publisher asked if I had any ideas.

40:52.964 --> 40:58.450
usually they just pat you on the head and say, oh, yeah, nice idea.

40:58.470 --> 41:04.857
But when they saw this, when I sent this to them, they were very excited and they really liked it right away.

41:04.897 --> 41:16.971
And I especially like it because I remember, you know, these houses in the background and we could cut through the school beside one of them.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.793
This reminds me of a couple of things.

41:18.813 --> 41:21.756
We have a, and the town that I live in, Grafton has a,

41:22.124 --> 41:24.046
bandstands like that.

41:24.066 --> 41:31.413
It was put up when they were filming Our Wilderness, Eugene O'Neill, which was practical with film and graphic, so they built it.

41:32.013 --> 41:32.534
It's there.

41:33.054 --> 41:37.279
I don't know if you've ever been to Illumination Night in Oklahoma.

41:37.699 --> 41:39.481
I've read about it.

41:39.721 --> 41:42.283
I read Alice Hoffman.

41:42.303 --> 41:45.286
Yeah, Alice has written about it.

41:45.506 --> 41:46.327
One more question.

41:46.407 --> 41:51.372
When you finally did, when your first book finally was published, not when it was sold, but

41:51.790 --> 42:03.006
If you can just describe for me the feeling that you had when you finally saw that book and you finally got your first reading and people began to respond to it.

42:03.487 --> 42:06.652
You're starting to hear from people I'm sure you've never heard from before.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.496
People I hadn't heard from in years and years.

42:09.736 --> 42:12.540
But also people writing to introduce themselves.

42:12.561 --> 42:19.030
I had a letter today from a guy who's remembering the Baker Street Irregulars in Minnesota.

42:19.415 --> 42:23.221
I have one chapter that's basically a mystery, and he's solving a mystery.

42:23.241 --> 42:24.323
Sherlock Holmes dies.

42:24.363 --> 42:28.389
It's a wonderful, wonderful thing.

42:28.409 --> 42:29.731
But there must have been a euphoric.

42:30.092 --> 42:44.334
Probably what sums it up for me is the first time I saw it in a bookstore, I was with my stepfather, and a shovel stick was there sooner than we thought it would be, and we said, oh, there it is.

42:44.474 --> 42:46.097
I just...

42:46.398 --> 42:48.240
I didn't want it to shrink away.

42:48.280 --> 42:51.804
I was afraid to even pick it up.

42:52.005 --> 42:57.331
I guess I thought everyone would know if they picked it up that it was in a book and I wouldn't know how to react.

42:57.351 --> 43:00.355
I was so self-conscious about the whole thing.

43:00.575 --> 43:03.138
That was late spring.

43:03.178 --> 43:07.203
Was this up right back in Andover?

43:07.363 --> 43:08.244
In Andover.

43:08.645 --> 43:14.852
As it happens when a book comes out, it comes out and you accept.

43:15.153 --> 43:28.488
symbols to be clashing, and the world to change, and suddenly there's the great silence that happens, and it's almost as if it didn't happen, and you're wondering what happened.

43:28.849 --> 43:38.600
And then I received a call in the fall that had been nominated for the National Book Award, and that was very much out of the blue.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.004
That was a shock to me.

43:42.608 --> 43:52.163
So I went from that late May reaction, the great silence, and then into November, found myself one night in New York.

43:52.864 --> 43:58.653
Joyce Carol Oates had me by the arms saying, Mary, Mary, come with me.

43:58.733 --> 44:00.997
I want you to meet Ed, Ed, Ed.

44:02.058 --> 44:04.763
Well, Ed turned out to yell Dr. Owen.

44:05.143 --> 44:05.243
Yeah.

44:06.305 --> 44:08.589
I interviewed him in this world hotel.

44:08.609 --> 44:08.869
Really?

44:09.254 --> 44:14.719
So it was an amazing, it really was an amazing humor.

44:15.221 --> 44:16.145
Quite a stretch.

44:16.728 --> 44:17.632
This is very nice.

44:17.752 --> 44:18.194
Thank you.

44:18.234 --> 44:19.078
Thank you so much.
