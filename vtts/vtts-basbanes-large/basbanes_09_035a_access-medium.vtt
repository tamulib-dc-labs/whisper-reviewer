WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:04.957
That's a minute machine.

00:04.977 --> 00:05.799
It's the smallest.

00:05.899 --> 00:06.480
And you know what?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.343
The fidelity is just wonderful, too.

00:08.363 --> 00:10.126
It is indeed.

00:11.268 --> 00:14.414
I'll just start.

00:15.275 --> 00:19.743
This must be quite amazing for you, this reaction.

00:20.304 --> 00:22.067
It is most surprising.

00:22.729 --> 00:26.916
Because these folks did come out in the States to...

00:27.622 --> 00:30.145
You don't mind if I just put this a little closer to you that way?

00:30.766 --> 00:36.032
To a very widespread and virtually universal indifference.

00:36.052 --> 00:42.339
As Goldsmith said, the public makes an absolute point of neglecting my works.

00:42.980 --> 00:45.242
That applied to these.

00:45.623 --> 00:55.654
And then suddenly, even before Richard Snow's very, very favorable work,

00:55.988 --> 00:59.011
review in the New York Times.

00:59.031 --> 01:09.143
Even before that, it began to change once Norton started publishing, because Harcourt Price and Lippincott had had a go, and we just didn't know.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.786
Lippincott was a very, very kind man.

01:12.166 --> 01:15.931
There was a dear man called Brendan Gill.

01:16.031 --> 01:17.232
No, no, it wasn't.

01:17.252 --> 01:17.933
What was his name?

01:18.193 --> 01:24.240
I dedicated one of the books to him, a dear man, and he encouraged me very heartily

01:24.490 --> 01:27.534
For they could not make a commercial success at all.

01:27.995 --> 01:30.619
They had very good reviews sometimes, very good.

01:30.639 --> 01:33.863
But now people... Now you're talking about in the States?

01:35.025 --> 01:36.126
I'm talking the States, yes.

01:36.167 --> 01:41.094
But your popularity, I guess, in the UK... It was not inconsiderable.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.395
It was not inconsiderable.

01:42.856 --> 01:44.078
But it was nothing.

01:44.118 --> 01:49.205
Well, I mean, after all, there are roughly 50 million people there, and I think you have.

01:49.365 --> 01:50.707
How many people do you have?

01:50.767 --> 01:53.351
About 260 million here, I guess.

01:53.371 --> 01:53.451
Yes.

01:54.292 --> 01:57.015
Yes, an awful lot more.

01:57.916 --> 02:03.762
And they make their voices felt in no uncertain way.

02:03.982 --> 02:07.806
Once they start, and then there's that snowball effect.

02:08.267 --> 02:09.208
It always works.

02:09.228 --> 02:12.832
Well, I've been writing about books, as I said, for close to 20 years.

02:13.092 --> 02:17.717
I've never seen anything quite like this, because there are certainly

02:18.322 --> 02:23.568
followings for individual workers, but you seem to cut across currents.

02:23.588 --> 02:26.752
I mean, just look at this, we have physicians here.

02:26.772 --> 02:32.439
Yes, I mean top men, top physicists, and that's harder still.

02:32.879 --> 02:33.580
It's amazing.

02:33.941 --> 02:35.202
And men and women.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.604
Women, particularly.

02:36.844 --> 02:43.452
Yes, I should say most of the people who write, an awful lot of people who write, they have to be sieved off by their publishers, otherwise

02:44.073 --> 02:47.076
I'm a very slow, poor letter writer.

02:47.497 --> 02:51.041
If I do half a dozen letters in the morning, well, that's my morning gone.

02:51.582 --> 02:55.306
Even if I use formulae, which I don't like, Dr. Gord letters.

02:56.407 --> 02:56.988
There it is.

02:58.349 --> 03:00.552
Did you conceive of these when you started?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.074
These are not amusements.

03:02.274 --> 03:05.518
I mean, these are, and I think that's important to point out.

03:05.538 --> 03:10.183
These, as John Bailey said, these are emphatically not adventure stories.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.607
They are concerned with the condition humane.

03:14.498 --> 03:40.618
And they are, it's relations between them, and the whole of it is intensified by them being shut up in a wooden box, set off to sea for months, years, with all the perils of war, of the elements, which are not inconsiderable in a sailing ship, shortage of food, shortage of water, overcrowding, disease.

03:40.798 --> 03:43.122
The whole thing is in a sort of hothouse,

03:44.873 --> 03:48.318
from the point of view of the development of human relations.

03:48.899 --> 03:59.635
And that I find very propitious for speaking about these matters, Judy, which is what I'm essentially interested in.

04:00.496 --> 04:05.663
The rest is the vehicle in which they come, and I make it as pleasant as ever I can, and I enjoy the vehicle.

04:05.683 --> 04:08.147
But the essence of the matter is a

04:08.313 --> 04:13.860
Is this your primary concern, this exploration of the relationship?

04:13.880 --> 04:14.861
Yes, of course it is.

04:14.881 --> 04:19.106
Of course the ocean is... Just as it was with Proust.

04:19.126 --> 04:19.646
Exactly.

04:20.708 --> 04:26.294
And the Proust omitted the funds.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.218
Let me preface this next statement.

04:29.278 --> 04:31.140
I spent three years at sea as a naval officer.

04:31.200 --> 04:31.640
Oh, did you?

04:31.661 --> 04:32.522
I'm an aircraft carrier.

04:32.702 --> 04:33.182
Oh, did you?

04:33.202 --> 04:35.485
Yes, you know what you're talking about.

04:36.393 --> 04:42.021
You know, an aircraft carrier may be a huge ship, but it's still a very small community.

04:42.061 --> 04:45.987
Exactly so, and you see one another every day, and you cannot get away from one another.

04:46.047 --> 04:50.834
I remember one of the quotations we had was at Johnson.

04:50.854 --> 04:56.783
They said, going to sea is a lot like going to prison, except that going to sea, you have the added danger of drowning.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.165
I think it was quite like that.

04:58.185 --> 05:02.772
There was fact, but he did say that going to prison usually gave you...

05:03.342 --> 05:07.707
Better company and better food and better company.

05:07.727 --> 05:09.409
But he wasn't too keen about that.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.431
No, indeed he wasn't.

05:10.451 --> 05:12.253
About the fellowship of the sea, shall we say.

05:12.273 --> 05:12.813
That's all.

05:14.535 --> 05:17.639
You know, of course, you've written some wonderful biographies.

05:17.799 --> 05:26.410
I read the Joseph of the Banks book with great pleasure, and coincidentally, Morton is publishing now a biography of Cook.

05:27.131 --> 05:27.611
Yes, yes.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.433
Which is quite wonderful.

05:29.493 --> 05:29.794
Yes.

05:30.535 --> 05:31.596
Very fine man, indeed.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.298
Did you see...

05:35.422 --> 05:41.911
writing the biographies, uh, writing history, like you did Picasso as well, as your primary work, as your, as your primary concern?

05:42.031 --> 05:42.391
No, they were.

05:42.411 --> 05:44.214
Do you more or less gravitate into this, uh?

05:44.915 --> 05:48.319
No, they, they, they were on the side.

05:49.421 --> 05:49.981
Great fun.

05:50.122 --> 05:51.764
I like, I like doing them very much.

05:51.784 --> 06:00.615
And the banks, of course, sewed up all this, all this, all, all rematch or anything, and encapsulated it.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.238
Of course, there you'll see it.

06:04.761 --> 06:04.821
Uh,

06:05.594 --> 06:09.358
rather set out in one book.

06:10.639 --> 06:22.470
It's true, you have to extrapolate to make the full tale, but it does connect with these books, remarkably well.

06:22.490 --> 06:33.400
In one of the books, I don't recall which, but you mentioned that you are creating some hypothetical years, and I wonder if you could just expand a little bit on that concept for me.

06:33.420 --> 06:33.760
Yes.

06:34.421 --> 06:34.521
Well,

06:36.357 --> 06:44.829
I don't like to be absolutely fixed to chronological exactitude, but I do want a degree of chronological credibility.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.733
And Homer didn't give a damn.

06:48.214 --> 06:56.085
He carried on the Sea of Troy really beyond all the possibilities.

06:56.105 --> 06:57.266
In the last ten years, I think.

06:57.286 --> 07:05.638
I mean, the logistics of the Sea of Troy as described by him just, you know, it can't be accepted.

07:06.462 --> 07:09.284
The Napoleonic was sufficiently close to us.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.947
My wife, for example, wears the Nile Medal.

07:12.547 --> 07:15.149
I mean, it's within three or four generations.

07:15.950 --> 07:22.436
At home I was talking of something very, very much earlier, and about which an enormous amount of legend had already accumulated.

07:22.456 --> 07:25.678
But I have to be a bit more accurate than that.

07:25.758 --> 07:26.099
A bit.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.860
I'm not tied to it.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.963
So I have dragged things on, rather.

07:31.583 --> 07:35.727
However, I am now within an easily close

07:36.128 --> 07:40.656
The awful, as Storr puts it, outbreak of peace.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.639
Ah.

07:42.659 --> 07:44.782
Do you have anxiety about this?

07:44.802 --> 07:52.535
Not really, but various people have said, Jack Aubrey has been on the post-captain's list for a long while.

07:53.036 --> 07:54.679
He must be very known.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.442
A flag list.

07:56.462 --> 07:57.784
Now, that's not really quite true.

07:57.804 --> 08:00.769
In point of fact, I was worried by...

08:01.238 --> 08:07.224
a critic who said that, and a critic no less than a professor of English literature at Oxford, John Bailey.

08:08.646 --> 08:09.767
Now, he had got it wrong.

08:11.068 --> 08:19.197
I worked that out very carefully, and the general rate, the average rate of being a post-captain was 25 years before the flag.

08:20.258 --> 08:28.326
Now, he was made post-captain only in, what, 1802, thereabouts.

08:28.711 --> 08:31.395
So, as far as that's concerned, I've got a lot of leeway.

08:33.457 --> 08:41.068
But there is this whole point of flag rank, which is very important to him, as it is to any sailor.

08:41.088 --> 08:47.476
And there is... There are the confines of historical credibility.

08:47.496 --> 08:56.228
So I don't think that in this particular war I can go on for much more than a volume of two.

08:56.248 --> 08:56.569
Really?

08:57.190 --> 08:57.570
No.

08:57.652 --> 09:06.324
I'm on 18 now, and I'm blockading West, whereas Wellington's army's advance in France now.

09:06.344 --> 09:24.688
However, I have a domestic situation here in this present book, which I think will tie up this present book, that I may come to a climax of this particular aspect of his career in the next, and then I have plans, if I'm spared, for another couple,

09:25.192 --> 09:28.357
I do particularly want to go to the 20 or perhaps 21 times.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.541
Well, this is 17, I believe.

09:31.581 --> 09:32.603
Yes, 18 is on the way.

09:32.623 --> 09:33.464
And 18 is in the works.

09:34.265 --> 09:35.828
You certainly see it as a corpus.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.150
Oh, quite certainly, yes.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.293
And we can pick these up.

09:39.894 --> 09:46.884
I think one of the beauties of the whole series or the cycle is that you can pick them up at any point, but it really does whet the appetite.

09:47.104 --> 09:52.051
But also, if you want a context, you mentioned Proust earlier.

09:52.131 --> 09:52.532
I mean...

09:52.968 --> 09:56.251
We talk about many novels, but one whole, I think.

09:56.271 --> 09:57.012
Yes, yes.

09:57.032 --> 10:01.556
And you can pick up almost any, you've got Hedda Shigelmalt, for example.

10:01.636 --> 10:02.156
Exactly.

10:02.176 --> 10:04.859
And so it goes, and it is an entity.

10:05.500 --> 10:13.587
There's a greater advantage in reading the entirety, but you can go, having read one after, you can go back and pick up the whole.

10:13.827 --> 10:20.173
Now, with 17, 18 in the works, and you say perhaps you see the end, I guess,

10:20.592 --> 10:27.802
I see the end for this particular war, but I have notions for a continuation beyond.

10:28.864 --> 10:30.045
With the characters?

10:30.065 --> 10:33.871
Oh, of course.

10:33.951 --> 10:36.354
They're changing for you all the time, aren't they?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.215
Oh, quite certainly.

10:37.235 --> 10:39.939
They're mature, I'm mature, they're mature.

10:39.959 --> 10:40.460
Exactly.

10:41.421 --> 10:49.232
I had a... We're talking about... It's amazing when you have two or three questions at the same time.

10:49.617 --> 10:57.951
You've been described quite flatteringly as people see qualities of Jane Austen and Forster in you.

10:58.011 --> 11:02.619
How do you respond to comparisons like that?

11:02.639 --> 11:09.491
Well, I'm extremely pleased at being compared with Jane Austen, whom I love deeply.

11:09.732 --> 11:13.498
She's very, very good, and she gets better the more you read her, I find.

11:15.065 --> 11:18.388
For sure, not much more by one way or another.

11:18.408 --> 11:20.810
I mean, the comparison doesn't really matter at all.

11:21.551 --> 11:27.155
You seem to enjoy the comparisons with writers of an earlier age.

11:27.836 --> 11:36.343
I've seen you in print described as a man who might enjoy living in the 18th or 19th century.

11:36.363 --> 11:43.890
Yes, but for the lack of brains and anesthesia and decent dentistry, I should refer to it as it is.

11:44.461 --> 11:46.865
I'm quite happy where I am.

11:46.885 --> 11:56.841
And, of course, the attraction of sailing as opposed to powered... And there is always a gift, isn't there?

11:56.921 --> 12:00.587
In every one of these books, you certainly can give us a sense of the sea.

12:00.607 --> 12:02.190
I think that's essential.

12:02.430 --> 12:02.871
Oh, yes.

12:05.315 --> 12:09.401
Now, I'm wondering now, this is... I don't know, I forgot to check how many pages.

12:09.481 --> 12:11.785
We're under 300 pages, but it's amazing how...

12:12.153 --> 12:13.594
much territory you cover.

12:13.614 --> 12:21.582
We have the slave trade, we have the French, of course, as always, the domestic situations.

12:21.622 --> 12:25.406
Do you plot these things very carefully?

12:25.426 --> 12:26.047
No, pretty well.

12:26.227 --> 12:28.549
Not very carefully, but a general line.

12:28.930 --> 12:42.143
And very often, as with mites, if something comes to me while I'm reflecting at night, and it really seems to me a useful piece, or fun,

12:44.249 --> 12:49.676
I'll interrupt my plot or put an intercalated piece, you see.

12:50.657 --> 12:54.302
I understand over the weekend you were on a nuclear submarine?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.204
Yes, Hampton she was called.

12:56.224 --> 12:57.146
Tell me a little bit about that.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.028
Do you remember which ship it was?

12:59.188 --> 12:59.789
The Hampton?

12:59.809 --> 13:00.069
Yes.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.172
That was the name of the boat?

13:02.372 --> 13:03.394
Yes.

13:03.414 --> 13:03.894
Hampton?

13:04.095 --> 13:04.815
Hampton, yes.

13:05.817 --> 13:09.902
I was there and I know very well what she was called Hampton, which I very kindly gave her a hat.

13:10.186 --> 13:10.947
Oh, that's nice.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.772
I hope there's gold braid on it.

13:13.852 --> 13:16.356
Certainly, a great deal of gold braid.

13:16.376 --> 13:23.827
That's, of course, in the Navy, everything about commander has gold braid.

13:24.027 --> 13:32.000
And they made my wife an honorary submariner with a beautiful little insignia.

13:32.200 --> 13:32.440
Dolphins?

13:32.460 --> 13:33.081
Dolphins, that's it.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.767
And she had given it to Mrs. Clinton immediately before.

13:37.220 --> 13:41.748
It was Admiral Emory down there.

13:41.788 --> 13:52.787
When you make these, I understand that when you make these trips, you always like to tie in a little bit of field work, I guess, a little bit of, on a previous trip you went to the Bronx Zoo.

13:52.928 --> 13:53.749
Yes.

13:54.270 --> 13:59.459
You visited old Irish Sides up in Boston, which they're doing a splendid job with that.

13:59.479 --> 14:01.062
Oh, dear.

14:01.222 --> 14:02.164
Splendid.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.412
That was quite a nice night with the fog coming.

14:04.432 --> 14:05.674
In fact, I wrote a piece of it.

14:05.694 --> 14:07.456
It was such a perfect night with the fog.

14:07.796 --> 14:10.800
It just reminded me of all these mornings when we went out to sea.

14:12.762 --> 14:15.385
You've always had this attraction for the sea.

14:15.645 --> 14:16.446
Oh, yes.

14:18.589 --> 14:20.050
Are you one who can feel comfortable?

14:20.411 --> 14:30.042
These gentlemen are returning from, I guess, it's a four-year mission, a four-year in this particular installment they've been circumnavigating for.

14:30.595 --> 14:32.057
for some time.

14:32.837 --> 14:36.722
Where it first starts, yes, where that kind of goes.

14:37.202 --> 14:37.523
Yes.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.526
Yes, that was an awful long time.

14:40.546 --> 14:47.854
I've been a little careful not to give it exact bounds in the calendar, but it's an awful long time.

14:47.874 --> 14:48.875
It's about that, yeah.

14:49.756 --> 14:59.607
I don't want to pick up too much time, by the way, so tell me when we're... I really did want to get to meet you and get a couple of quotes, and I know how busy you're.

15:00.228 --> 15:01.370
your time is.

15:02.010 --> 15:08.199
You did say that you have a grand design for the series of novels.

15:08.259 --> 15:10.502
Is there a grand design in your view?

15:11.203 --> 15:11.484
Yes.

15:13.106 --> 15:13.406
Yes.

15:14.087 --> 15:28.868
Well, the wheel comes from the whole... It is interesting also that

15:29.827 --> 15:43.585
And this is one of the more clever technical skills that you bring to the task, is even though we know the outcome, we the reader, from this remove of a hundred and... There's not much suspense about the war, as well.

15:43.826 --> 15:57.724
But for us, but there certainly is this... When you get caught up into the novel, you've managed to just inject this right degree of uncertainty, I guess, and...

15:58.919 --> 16:05.426
When you had the characters also, did you, from the beginning, did you foresee a series of continuing characters?

16:05.446 --> 16:05.667
Oh, yes.

16:05.687 --> 16:06.748
Oh, quite certainly.

16:06.768 --> 16:12.354
If you'll remember, the very first ends with the court-martial of Jack Aubrey for the loss of the sofa.

16:13.575 --> 16:14.356
He's acquitted.

16:14.877 --> 16:20.623
I mean, he was taken by a French squadron, after all, of the 74th.

16:20.663 --> 16:23.687
He had no... And he's acquitted.

16:24.127 --> 16:27.711
And as will... Come on, and...

16:28.231 --> 16:38.306
the court model hands back his sword and hopes it will be used with equal success and courage on future occasions.

16:38.346 --> 16:43.574
Well, I mean, that's a clear example, but the next book begins with his doing so.

16:44.255 --> 16:47.079
And so, they're all open-ended.

16:48.641 --> 16:58.035
You've been described by one reviewer, I don't recall which one, but one reviewer has described you as the best historical, I mean,

16:58.353 --> 16:59.515
That's a categorical statement.

16:59.535 --> 17:00.776
Have you seen that?

17:00.796 --> 17:01.798
That's Richard Snow.

17:02.238 --> 17:08.947
The best historical novel ever written.

17:09.007 --> 17:14.495
He's a man who's pretty much given to understatement, but I don't really resent it.

17:14.995 --> 17:21.584
But I'm just wondering, in your view, what is incumbent upon the historical novelist?

17:21.624 --> 17:25.930
I hate to use the word mission,

17:26.315 --> 17:44.554
Insofar as he has a mission, which is, yes, I must admit, a forbidden word, he has to write about that which transcends the merely temporal, but in a different time of some different value.

17:44.634 --> 17:47.798
What are these shocking things, do you think, these people?

17:49.740 --> 17:51.141
These firefighters.

17:51.897 --> 17:56.221
But they have revolvers, I suppose.

17:56.401 --> 17:57.983
They're probably campus security.

17:58.003 --> 18:00.665
I mean, I had to go through a battery of things to get in here.

18:00.685 --> 18:03.148
Well, let's go back to historical knowledge.

18:03.708 --> 18:08.994
Here's to describe man in his intemporal aspect.

18:10.775 --> 18:20.925
In a given time, with different mornings round him, with a culture that has

18:21.580 --> 18:49.647
on a similar basis but with different emphases and this is to do in a language that is convincing for the period of which he is writing but he is essentially to speak about what are human beings and there is an eternal humanity

18:49.964 --> 18:54.470
from about the very earliest records known to men.

18:55.291 --> 19:07.947
The cave paintings that I have to know, they were painted by people one would have spoken to with real understanding.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.331
One knows exactly what that wise and what that wild boy is doing.

19:12.152 --> 19:18.520
There was an immediate fellowship, so there is, with the two men in the Iliad.

19:18.854 --> 19:28.268
the two soldiers on the walls of Troy who see Helen go by, and they say roughly, well, it's worth it, it's worth it, worth it.

19:29.650 --> 19:31.152
They might have said that afterwards.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.696
They were saying, Brigitte Bardot, a man in the room.

19:34.317 --> 19:37.462
One feels an immediate contact.

19:38.764 --> 19:46.195
You mentioned the concern of what are human beings, and of course, again, we set these stories in the early 1800s.

19:46.529 --> 19:49.193
Do you feel that human nature is a constant?

19:49.233 --> 19:50.716
There are constants in it.

19:51.177 --> 19:54.522
And there are a lot of variables round about that nucleus.

19:55.003 --> 20:02.776
So it seems to be... One suffers very much with Lizzie Bennet when her relatives behave in a vulgar manner.

20:02.796 --> 20:04.599
I'm talking, of course, of Brian Bridgetus.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.685
And that's the constant.

20:09.326 --> 20:11.490
Their manner of behaving vulgar.

20:11.993 --> 20:36.651
various from from time to time what is considered vulgar whether you must change up your knife and fork i mean what the hell but for some for a generation or so it matters but the embarrassment remains in this constant but when you are writing when you're creating and characterizing these these characters are they late 20th century people

20:36.867 --> 20:38.909
There are people in that period.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.611
So you have to enter that period yourself.

20:40.751 --> 20:41.592
Oh, quite certainly.

20:41.612 --> 20:42.013
And you do.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.274
Oh, well, well, well, well, well.

20:43.334 --> 20:44.676
And you're very comfortable there.

20:44.756 --> 20:45.377
Perfectly.

20:45.817 --> 20:46.738
Perfectly.

20:46.758 --> 20:47.479
I know the language.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.941
I know the architecture.

20:49.541 --> 20:58.652
I live in an ancient civilization with an architecture that hasn't changed in my childhood.

20:58.732 --> 20:59.913
It hasn't changed at all.

21:00.474 --> 21:05.119
In a countryside, it hasn't changed much, above all in Ireland and in my part of Catalonia.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.243
No, I'm really quite determined.

21:08.263 --> 21:13.549
And as a Catholic, using its own very recent Latin language.

21:13.569 --> 21:16.072
It's not classical Latin, but it's an ecclesiastical lesson.

21:16.112 --> 21:18.014
It hasn't changed 1,500 years.

21:18.575 --> 21:24.002
You see, you can slide back to that with precious little trouble.

21:24.502 --> 21:26.745
Now, you write, I think you said you write in the morning.

21:27.225 --> 21:27.526
Yes.

21:27.606 --> 21:29.148
You write, I'm sure, by longhand.

21:29.308 --> 21:30.389
Of course.

21:30.409 --> 21:33.933
None of this word processing business.

21:34.174 --> 21:35.275
How is his handwriting, sir?

21:36.385 --> 21:37.286
Very legible.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.410
Do you do many drafts?

21:40.490 --> 21:41.491
Are there many variants?

21:41.511 --> 21:41.772
No.

21:45.557 --> 21:47.319
I write a set of notes for the entirety.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.784
I write closer notes when I'm sitting out on each chapter.

21:52.385 --> 21:57.271
And then, so that I shall forget all these notes, I tune them sometimes to the wall.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.475
Sometimes they vanish in a heap of papers.

22:01.537 --> 22:04.080
My filing system isn't quite what it might be.

22:05.258 --> 22:06.439
But then I write away.

22:06.459 --> 22:11.045
I write in a good day, a very good day, a couple of thousand words.

22:12.988 --> 22:20.297
Then when I finish my chapter, I type it as far as my typing ability allows me.

22:20.317 --> 22:23.821
Editing as I go.

22:23.921 --> 22:24.742
I left off stage.

22:25.223 --> 22:26.805
I reread the manuscript.

22:26.825 --> 22:28.367
Then type there.

22:28.507 --> 22:31.030
Then I edit the manuscript.

22:31.431 --> 22:34.995
Then I show it to my wife, who, when we've agreed on balance,

22:35.752 --> 22:36.453
differences.

22:37.214 --> 22:38.656
She then types it pretty.

22:38.676 --> 22:39.437
That's interesting.

22:39.517 --> 22:41.640
So your wife is kind of an editorial woman?

22:41.660 --> 22:42.001
Oh, very much.

22:42.021 --> 22:42.922
Oh, dear Lord, yes.

22:43.222 --> 22:46.567
She's a very important part of the process.

22:46.587 --> 22:51.734
In terms of reading critically what you write, or does she also give input?

22:51.754 --> 22:54.458
I hate that word, too, but make suggestions.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.921
Input, I guess, is the word.

22:58.443 --> 22:58.604
No.

22:58.804 --> 23:05.133
Are there ever any serendipitous turns for you, or is it pretty firmly structured once you're underway?

23:05.153 --> 23:05.353
Yes.

23:05.620 --> 23:13.448
You see, I'm so accustomed to my own rhythm that's... So it goes, it's... Pretty well.

23:14.590 --> 23:23.739
Unless I've been vexed, unless people write to me, unless visitors come, or blight strikes, or a vineyard, or that sort of thing.

23:23.839 --> 23:28.584
But I mean, what I'm saying, I guess, is that you never encounter any surprises in the narrative along the way.

23:29.405 --> 23:30.987
Well, yes, occasionally.

23:31.507 --> 23:34.450
What I like to think of as a brilliant thought will occur to me.

23:37.252 --> 23:38.333
And that goes in.

23:38.734 --> 23:40.675
Sometimes it makes me very happy.

23:40.695 --> 23:42.057
Sometimes it comes to me in the night.

23:42.777 --> 23:43.778
Very often.

23:44.139 --> 23:45.620
And I write it the next morning.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.724
And just one quick question and I'm going to let you go because I think my half hour is about up.

23:51.385 --> 23:52.426
Who do you read for pleasure?

23:52.446 --> 23:56.230
You've mentioned... Well, you see, I write an awful lot.

23:56.290 --> 23:58.712
I've got a great many other things to do.

23:58.810 --> 24:02.976
You have to keep abreast reading a decent paper like Le Monde.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.440
And reading Le Monde is the best part of an hour.

24:07.522 --> 24:08.663
I do like to listen to music.

24:09.224 --> 24:12.208
I have a fairly active social life.

24:12.789 --> 24:18.056
So I just don't read very much new stuff unless I'm reviewing it, unless it's a friend's book.

24:19.118 --> 24:22.422
I generally go back to my own very particular friends.

24:22.587 --> 24:31.615
At the moment I'm reading critical, solidly through Chaucer, but at Ard Mount.

24:31.635 --> 24:33.337
I know him very well, Closier.

24:35.779 --> 24:37.100
It's easy going.

24:37.721 --> 24:42.826
Jane Austen I look into very frequently.

24:42.906 --> 24:45.929
I'm reading War and Peace at the moment for this journal.

24:46.249 --> 24:48.031
Oh dear, it is so.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.653
Yes, I don't read Russian reads.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.945
They did, were moderate at one time, but I don't, you know.

24:55.345 --> 25:00.092
Every French I thought, at least, I write in French.

25:00.112 --> 25:03.836
And the Mongol translation of Tolstoy is very, very good.

25:04.117 --> 25:07.000
Most of the English translations are painful to degree.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.924
But Tolstoy, naughty so-called.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.387
Dear he so-called.

25:12.407 --> 25:14.590
So much better than I can remember it.

25:14.610 --> 25:15.291
That's a great line.

25:15.732 --> 25:16.353
Oh, dear.

25:17.094 --> 25:19.797
And when you consider, my...

25:20.367 --> 25:24.451
That's all my things, perhaps, sometimes, occasionally, or twice.

25:24.471 --> 25:29.095
Countess Tolstoy quoted out War and Peace eight diatoms.

25:29.115 --> 25:29.395
Wow.

25:30.736 --> 25:32.318
Isn't that right?

25:32.358 --> 25:33.679
And, of course, there were no diatoms.

25:33.719 --> 25:35.260
War and Peace, no less.

25:35.821 --> 25:38.203
And they were harrowing furiously all the time.

25:38.263 --> 25:40.245
That's probably why he took off on that.

25:41.586 --> 25:44.148
I'm going to, I think I'm going to wrap it up, sir.

25:44.168 --> 25:48.552
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to inscribe a happy... Okay, sir, well.

25:48.835 --> 25:51.480
But my chapter is just about exactly 10 minutes.

25:51.500 --> 25:51.781
Really?

25:51.901 --> 25:52.562
Really close.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.088
So you have an internal clock.

25:55.689 --> 25:57.733
We basically feel that's it.

25:57.813 --> 26:01.360
And I think my internal clock tells me my time is that.

26:01.420 --> 26:01.941
Thank you very much.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.384
Thank you very much, sir.

26:03.404 --> 26:06.210
It was a great pleasure, and I look forward to the next opportunity.

26:06.470 --> 26:07.933
Thank you very much for your time.

26:07.953 --> 26:09.797
Thank you.
