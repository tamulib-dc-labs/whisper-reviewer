WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:06.882
of literary.

00:08.245 --> 00:13.999
John Felsen wrote the order of my life.

00:14.019 --> 00:18.951
He died in his ordeal and his tornado, and he died in his death.

00:19.302 --> 00:24.928
And Daniel Boone approved of every word of it.

00:24.948 --> 00:29.974
Lord Byron wrote that famous poem about Daniel Boone.

00:29.994 --> 00:32.016
And Daniel approved of that.

00:32.036 --> 00:37.943
And if he were here today, he'd approve of John's paragraph.

00:38.764 --> 00:44.731
And they'll go on and on and on to the end of time.

00:44.751 --> 00:45.632
Lord signed Daniel Boone.

00:46.933 --> 00:48.735
But I had the privilege.

00:49.154 --> 00:52.399
But during Daniel, a good turn, I hope.

00:53.741 --> 01:11.230
I got a letter from the young skipper of the submarine, Daniel Boone, asking me why to scrape up from Daniel Boone Reddick's and send them to the city to go aboard the Daniel Boone, which was being lost in their island.

01:11.378 --> 01:17.065
I don't like that we were like Frank Allen.

01:17.085 --> 01:19.549
But I didn't have a two, three, three, three, four.

01:19.649 --> 01:28.140
I had a San Diego letter that I would permit to go on board this San Diego.

01:30.443 --> 01:33.307
I had about 20 barbers.

01:33.447 --> 01:35.430
It's a horrifying thing.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.352
And I had a board.

01:37.568 --> 01:47.863
So, I sent Daniel around the world.

01:48.043 --> 01:58.598
Every time that Daniel

02:03.337 --> 02:10.627
Finally, when he came around in the law, he returned all that material.

02:10.647 --> 02:16.635
But he had been so sensitive about protecting the letter.

02:16.655 --> 02:29.893
He said it might be wrapped in, I think, another towel in the United States name to dry off every animal for his name in their mouth.

02:30.675 --> 02:32.517
But he just told me,

02:32.497 --> 02:37.565
by winning the old blood and leather in the throat into the river.

02:38.366 --> 02:43.114
He was a classmate in fitting there.

02:43.154 --> 02:49.324
And then there was that marvelous group of people, James Howard, that established Harris now.

02:49.658 --> 03:03.904
And those missionaries who'd come out and finally shaped them, which is in a very fine state of preservation, marvelous spot.

03:04.044 --> 03:09.715
It is the highest part of the trajectory where you can go and discuss anything.

03:09.735 --> 03:11.899
But I want to come back just a moment.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.101
I want to go on there.

03:14.380 --> 03:29.000
I was the first historian to break into this very guarded publication bank.

03:29.020 --> 03:35.168
And they didn't know whether a historian could do it or not.

03:35.188 --> 03:38.232
I set up five chapters.

03:38.252 --> 03:42.618
And I went to the meeting of the American Historical Association in New York.

03:42.878 --> 03:44.320
Don't think many of them say it.

03:44.890 --> 03:49.716
And I went up to the Fire and Reinhardt office.

03:49.836 --> 03:58.005
I was prepared to go into one of those rushing things, that little bit of stationery that he had looked like a movie version.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.989
I will publish his own.

04:01.009 --> 04:04.813
I had a darn fire with his shirt tail out.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.235
The desk fire was so high.

04:06.956 --> 04:11.421
And he pulled around for 10 minutes looking for my man.

04:11.671 --> 04:20.679
And he said, I've got a room for a room here somewhere.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.625
It was fun.

04:22.825 --> 04:24.972
But by that time, I was the fastest day.

04:25.272 --> 04:33.601
I was waiting for John to find whatever it was that somebody said about that magic.

04:33.621 --> 04:38.526
But when he finally found it, it was available for the use.

04:38.546 --> 04:43.712
And that meant that my spirit reminded me for just one moment.

04:43.732 --> 04:51.280
Then John proceeded to set upon me, giving me a lecture about how I've developed this story

04:52.272 --> 04:59.321
And that last year, I went back down to Pennsylvania, New Salem.

05:00.543 --> 05:06.131
And the first thing I heard was a thing that John was talking about.

05:06.151 --> 05:10.336
One historian says to another, why are you working on now?

05:10.476 --> 05:16.845
And whatever it was, almost exploded in just prayer to mind.

05:16.825 --> 05:27.982
When my book came out, there was a review of it, I think, in the old New York house for me, my bad friend of it.

05:28.082 --> 05:35.674
And he said, if he gets by the home people, he's by the national public trade.

05:37.818 --> 05:40.422
I got by the home people.

05:40.442 --> 05:41.503
I don't have a few of them.

05:42.505 --> 05:44.588
But it thrilled my life.

05:45.850 --> 05:49.718
to do that, folks.

05:49.738 --> 06:02.965
And the thread, the dribble of the thread, more than that, gets to the truck, right around, right straight through the heart of the expanding America.

06:03.181 --> 06:09.050
That's part of the frontier where it all started.

06:09.731 --> 06:10.312
But I had the privilege.

06:10.512 --> 06:12.495
And apparently I don't know where to write stories.

06:13.256 --> 06:14.418
I can't believe this.

06:14.899 --> 06:18.724
Oh my, I couldn't go home without this.

06:18.925 --> 06:23.772
John Farrell and all that lecture on, I don't know where the story is.

06:25.304 --> 06:31.452
said to me, and I'm glad you said what you did about the military.

06:31.553 --> 06:35.939
Who's your illustrator?

06:36.139 --> 06:36.920
I said, the military.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.744
I never heard anything proud of it, the military.

06:39.764 --> 06:44.230
They said, yes, you go home and come up with a military.

06:44.250 --> 06:52.341
Well, I had just seen the book illustrated by a young man named John Feldman III.

06:53.620 --> 07:00.868
I went home to look up John's film.

07:01.329 --> 07:06.455
I didn't know anything about it except I was interested in the illustrations that he had produced this movie.

07:06.475 --> 07:19.830
I went up in the mountains with a nut, a first-rate nut, whose vows are about to carry down on the border, and this is a fellow that spread the front of the radio station.

07:20.603 --> 07:26.655
It came up with rain.

07:26.695 --> 07:29.902
What day in Appalachian Islands did it rain?

07:30.022 --> 07:32.587
Get out of it.

07:32.607 --> 07:34.090
If you're in a river valley, get away from it.

07:37.276 --> 07:52.336
We caught the first fort, the second one, we were a little deeper, and the third one, another set up to my camp in the Cuddy River water.

07:52.356 --> 07:58.505
And this fort, the fort of the Cuddy River and I, was right on the right.

07:58.805 --> 08:02.490
We went up to a mountain cabin and slept up in the hammock that night.

08:02.470 --> 08:10.000
We went over the next day to the Feynman Fettman School.

08:10.501 --> 08:19.253
If the cat had drank something, he knew it couldn't have looked more.

08:19.273 --> 08:24.961
Then came this bright youngish fellow, Josh Fettman.

08:25.302 --> 08:31.631
I said, I talked to him and he was going, you wouldn't have anything to do.

08:31.651 --> 08:31.971
I listened.

08:32.305 --> 08:40.782
He was down there the next day.

08:44.590 --> 08:52.727
He was hung there high.

08:53.365 --> 09:15.525
I'd like to go back very quickly

09:15.505 --> 09:35.134
because we are going to have illustrators up here this morning if they have anything to do with the illustration of their book and so how that how that might work

09:37.477 --> 09:40.600
Yeah, this is very brief.

09:41.301 --> 09:56.595
My mother was the president of the PPA, and my illustrator was the person who did the drawings on the cover of the PPA's Wiki Newsletter.

09:56.615 --> 10:00.119
She did a lot of other things .

10:00.139 --> 10:04.463
She was a mile away, and totally fell in the place.

10:04.443 --> 10:08.530
This is the theme of search for .

10:10.535 --> 10:28.785
Well, one in this video was him and children, three hands of rain, he died in the shoes.

10:28.805 --> 10:34.534
First of all, I think it's a drawing of the Great Lakes support area, which he pictured for the Great Command painting.

10:36.134 --> 10:42.263
And I was asked to recommend.

10:43.886 --> 10:46.870
And I recommended him.

10:48.012 --> 10:48.513
He's made a few samples.

10:48.533 --> 10:48.773
I liked him.

10:48.793 --> 10:50.175
And so he was on board.

10:50.195 --> 10:55.062
I'll jump to the end of my book.

10:55.082 --> 11:04.757
I asked Hume to accompany me to co-signing at Halley's bookstore.

11:04.737 --> 11:13.767
And he declined debt for the price of the angle.

11:13.787 --> 11:18.292
And we were sitting together in the gymnasium.

11:20.574 --> 11:22.316
One of my students would come up.

11:22.336 --> 11:25.219
He was a very sad guy.

11:25.419 --> 11:31.746
And Stuart would say, I think he would say, I'm living in a class of all of them all.

11:31.766 --> 11:32.787
And he'd say, that's all.

11:33.323 --> 11:37.908
And I've been all afternoon.

11:37.928 --> 11:48.639
So sitting next to us was, you know, Elliot Kazin, who had just come out of what I think was the first very book.

11:48.979 --> 11:55.326
It was called The Arrangement.

11:55.466 --> 11:58.369
And he came and said over to me, and I just read a few pages.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.954
And Kim was a redhead.

12:01.696 --> 12:07.718
I turned it over to Kim and he was really .

12:15.241 --> 12:37.314
Well, by the time, both Reinhard and Winston, in the time of reading a lot of books, the author had nothing to do with two musical illustrations.

12:38.596 --> 12:42.261
And so that sort of, excuse me, on the ground, it's not like that.

12:42.460 --> 12:47.104
However, this gentleman will have to be because

12:47.354 --> 12:53.940
We had a most unfortunate experience.

12:53.960 --> 13:00.787
He was a relapsed man and had a quite good reputation in San Francisco.

13:00.807 --> 13:04.591
And he was inherently looking at his students.

13:04.611 --> 13:10.957
There's a very mediocre job that you can talk about with one hand and make a nice little, little extra pocketbook.

13:10.977 --> 13:16.382
And so when the pictures came to me from my article, they worked around the river.

13:18.505 --> 13:30.137
And I immediately, he was weak, and I didn't know what to do, so I sent a telegram.

13:31.358 --> 13:41.328
I don't know if his face was still there or not, but to the then editor, and said, you know, what are we going to do?

13:41.348 --> 13:44.631
Because the pictures were, I mean, the text was almost ready.

13:45.168 --> 14:05.860
And I had sent him specific details about the areas that I suggested that he illustrated and told him about the Indians.

14:06.025 --> 14:15.419
The California Indians were unlike the Eastern Indians or the Plains Indians over there.

14:15.439 --> 14:21.187
And so the Indians that were drawn came with war bonnets.

14:22.148 --> 14:35.728
And one thing that struck me was a common old firehouse, which was in Yuba City, which is a new group on the other side of the street.

14:35.962 --> 14:48.613
So we had quite a time, and so hope wired here, apparently, a very strong message.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.157
And I received help of it.

14:50.322 --> 15:02.673
And he said, more or less, he had orders to come over and see.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.016
And this was the first attempt.

15:06.036 --> 15:10.581
He never, he was supposed to, he was himselfless.

15:10.601 --> 15:13.263
And the first thing I knew was that the children were seeing him.

15:13.283 --> 15:16.166
So he came, and that was one of the most unhappy experiences in my life.

15:16.406 --> 15:18.608
I went to the door, and this man's face was purple.

15:18.740 --> 15:22.664
And he was absolutely furious.

15:22.684 --> 15:27.549
He said, oh, Brian Arden, Winston, he accused him of plagiarism.

15:27.569 --> 15:30.292
And so I said, no, it wasn't that.

15:30.673 --> 15:34.336
He just chose the wrong river.

15:34.356 --> 15:38.761
So I suggested that I go with him.

15:38.841 --> 15:41.404
My daughter and I go with him.

15:41.424 --> 15:42.385
And I go into the country.

15:42.545 --> 15:43.686
And I know it so well.

15:43.927 --> 15:46.249
I can take him and he's seen me places.

15:46.820 --> 16:02.837
uh the rivers are very different physical than anyone between western american rivers and of course they're writing for an audience that knows about uh people who do interviews and so forth and they're not going to accept new lists

16:02.817 --> 16:29.506
So, he had resigned on a dying boat by a sunset vaccine.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.828
So, eventually,

16:32.078 --> 16:39.007
Uh, the things, all I can draw, all of the things, of course.

16:39.027 --> 16:40.088
And, uh, I had to go and do research.

16:40.108 --> 16:41.930
And I do research and I need to check out folks.

16:41.951 --> 16:49.981
I sent them to my home and they, uh, they said there was many of them.

16:50.001 --> 16:56.269
And, yes, they were, and I never was having to cover.

16:56.289 --> 16:56.669
I had to show them.

16:56.689 --> 16:57.991
And, uh, they were, and I never was having to cover.

16:58.011 --> 16:58.391
I had to show them.

16:58.411 --> 16:59.713
And, uh, they were, and I never was having to cover.

16:59.733 --> 17:00.875
I had to show them.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.275
I had to show them.

17:01.424 --> 17:28.090
I was at a sort of an unfortunate

17:29.318 --> 17:41.464
He was the official artist, president of the Historical Society.

17:41.484 --> 17:46.635
He did two sketches, which was very nice, and he asked him back.

17:48.674 --> 17:53.478
and put up the facts that I have.

17:54.299 --> 17:57.742
And so I sounded around, and I can't remember too much.

17:57.762 --> 18:02.647
Maybe Jerry Hazard, who is here today, was my illustrator.

18:02.667 --> 18:06.510
He can tell you as to his side of the story.

18:07.471 --> 18:13.597
My side was that I heard that Jerry Hazard was a very good illustrator.

18:14.498 --> 18:15.699
He knew the same story.

18:16.119 --> 18:16.960
He loved it.

18:17.362 --> 18:27.860
And so I had, over my years, collected photographs in an album of scenic youth along the St.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.463
Troy and also people.

18:32.007 --> 18:34.071
Jerry and I had conference.

18:34.355 --> 18:54.051
several conferences and we went through the slides and the photographs and so forth and then he said this is nice that's nice no that's not so good and so he was chosen as the illustrator and i never regretted it because

18:54.638 --> 19:11.938
well thank you all please join me in thanking

19:21.942 --> 19:25.492
Actually, what did you say to many of your subsequent books?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.858
Oh, I've done 17 books in all.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.110
The French Brawl, published in 1955, was my first one.

19:32.190 --> 19:35.479
And subsequent books...

19:36.016 --> 19:52.017
I find that some part of those books really grew out often of the French broth, of an interest I had, of a subject I addressed, of a way I told a story, so that I figured that was, shall we say, roots...

19:52.283 --> 19:55.108
for the rest of my writing career.

19:55.449 --> 20:00.297
Did you know any of these other authors who were here today prior to discussion?

20:00.317 --> 20:01.219
Oh, Thomas Clark.

20:01.339 --> 20:03.783
I've known him, but I knew a number of the authors.

20:03.803 --> 20:07.530
Of course, Carl Palmer, who did the Hudson and the Susquehanna.

20:07.550 --> 20:09.914
I knew Frank Waters, who did the Conflata.

20:10.415 --> 20:12.418
I knew...

20:12.398 --> 20:17.967
Oh, who was the poet who did the, well, anyway.

20:18.408 --> 20:21.493
So it was a fraternity, sorority, so to speak.

20:21.513 --> 20:32.331
Well, no, it was just the sort of thing that my husband and I would look up, these people in various places, Hodding Carter, who did the Miss Lower Mississippi, a number of the Frank...

20:32.311 --> 20:36.136
He did the Yazoo, Frank Smith.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.239
Difficult name to remember, Smith.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.661
Frank Smith did the Yazoo.

20:39.681 --> 20:41.524
Not easier than Lesbians.

20:41.724 --> 20:43.327
No, did the Yazoo.

20:44.168 --> 20:45.830
But it was a touchstone.

20:46.131 --> 20:51.298
If we happened to be someplace, I met Frank Waters on a trip to China, one of the first trips that

20:51.430 --> 20:54.833
and the Americans made it to China.

20:54.913 --> 20:58.837
How do you feel about Carol Fitzgerald's work on this?

20:58.857 --> 21:00.258
Oh, I think it's wonderful.

21:00.278 --> 21:08.946
I think the fact that somebody had this intensity, and I'm afraid that I've not always answered her as promptly as I should, but I've tried to cooperate.

21:08.966 --> 21:10.928
But it is quite an accomplishment.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.950
Well, it is an accomplishment.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.212
She seems to have taken it to the next dimension.

21:15.252 --> 21:15.932
Well, she has.

21:15.972 --> 21:17.594
No, it's not just collecting.

21:17.934 --> 21:18.855
She's a scholar.

21:18.835 --> 21:39.409
that's right she's got she did what the sillies tried to do which was to be her history but to be you see i like to remember that the major part of the word history is s-t-o-r-y and that makes all the difference in the world because you have the history is the

21:39.389 --> 21:44.656
under part of the glacier and the tip of the glacier and the story and the book.

21:44.696 --> 21:54.490
So it's factual, it's based in fact, but that doesn't mean you can use your human imagination and your human, you know, knowledge of things.

21:54.691 --> 21:55.091
That's great.

21:55.171 --> 21:58.256
I'm sorry to pop in, but I'll use these quotes.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.017
Thank you very much.

21:59.037 --> 22:00.739
Well, I want you to... Maris Wall.

22:14.067 --> 22:27.442
through my equipment, because the temperature to the tonsilary was here in Washington, and it kind of got to me.

22:28.964 --> 22:29.724
I'm going to deal with that.

22:29.744 --> 22:32.628
I'm here to the wonderful adventures that come to Seekers After Rivers.

22:33.288 --> 22:41.037
And then you're also such as an audience that's been converted, and I share with you my experiences, which is a very wonderful thing.

22:42.029 --> 22:44.134
I grew up on a shore in Lake Michigan.

22:44.896 --> 22:54.340
And, originally, there were different bodies of water, and so it was the other side of which you cannot see.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.282
I really don't fall into it.

22:55.303 --> 22:58.671
And we're going to come home to home shortly and to the field.

22:59.191 --> 23:07.549
their great power, their elemental nature, and their symbolism for our American culture.

23:07.569 --> 23:17.790
And a lot of this stood out in our experience in the last years of working with the Romans of America series.

23:17.990 --> 23:30.188
We do exhibit and promote collections that we have on hand, or new collections that we receive, and don't do much creating.

23:30.649 --> 23:32.432
We're beyond that.

23:32.452 --> 23:44.790
So this was a new experience, and I'm a little hesitant about it, but the elements that came into play were uniformly play durable, and I'm going to share those with you.

23:46.154 --> 23:51.760
I also applaud, as you have heard, a very persuasive gentleman and his interest in the river.

23:53.582 --> 23:59.509
It's been the answer, and sponsorship of this topic, of course, got excited.

24:00.350 --> 24:05.976
And we had a legitimate page in the collection with Donald Davison's papers.

24:06.196 --> 24:11.622
And if you've heard, Donald Davison is the only author of the two volumes

24:11.720 --> 24:19.266
the history of a river, the Tennessee, and as we explored and learned,

24:20.073 --> 24:35.755
more clearly perhaps than we had before about the divided nature of Donald Davidson and in a way that he expressed these passions of his folklore and for the native culture of the region.

24:36.616 --> 24:45.608
So we have in the first volume of the Tennessee, the Romantic Davidson is the second volume of the Tennessee,

24:46.533 --> 24:59.925
agrarian anti-industrial reactions to what has happened to the land because of the way the river has been handled in that century.

24:59.945 --> 25:16.540
So the Navis and Garnelake and other selections which held the most at Loma Dyson and the Cumberland, steam moats on the Cumberland, we have more of a foundation there than we knew we had.

25:19.152 --> 25:38.154
And I was so aware that it was an opportunity to work with an ultimate scholar-collector who's just really held the many facets of the enterprise, the great publishing enterprise of the 20th century, which is the purpose of America.

25:38.174 --> 25:46.324
It touches everyone, and I hope it will grow to touch even more than the young people in the country.

25:47.992 --> 25:58.244
Terrell Fitzgerald accepted a role as guest curator of the exhibit that he's planning to have with the reality talk in special collections.

25:58.385 --> 26:01.849
Of course, he was in Fort Wanamiel, and I was in Nashville.

26:01.869 --> 26:15.265
And we were trying to image the things of ourselves and managed to have a fairly cogent discussion of it through

26:15.599 --> 26:18.342
and talking over the telephone.

26:19.042 --> 26:33.636
And we were enormously helped by Carol's very generosity not only to share her collection with us, but to send it on early so that we had the physical artifacts to see and to place on exhibit.

26:34.377 --> 26:43.345
We've documented the exhibit area, and I do have some slides which are going to be shown this afternoon

26:43.814 --> 26:49.121
for the procession, because the equipment is where they're going to take place.

26:49.201 --> 27:03.979
But I also, if you're not able to either, have a few photographs of the gallery area, and that will give you an idea of what the layout was.

27:07.804 --> 27:12.690
We have, let's see what I think.

27:12.957 --> 27:17.567
And a lot of wall things.

27:19.712 --> 27:29.593
And when you deal with literary selections, you deal with print, and not so much with image or illustration.

27:31.177 --> 27:32.299
And so there wasn't a

27:32.482 --> 27:44.040
a challenge to distribute the material in an interesting way, in a compelling way for an audience.

27:44.941 --> 27:51.932
And so we decided to focus on the rivers that are important in the sea.

27:52.493 --> 27:59.063
The Cumberland, the Kentucky, the French Broad, the Ohio, the lower Mississippi, and the Tennessee itself.

27:59.566 --> 28:11.702
and collected related originals, so the primary documentation for those rivers to show, along with the book, in the landscape.

28:11.952 --> 28:15.676
We had correspondence from several of the writers.

28:15.696 --> 28:23.105
In fact, a wonderful correspondence that Davidson had had was the publisher of things that were wrong.

28:23.125 --> 28:31.175
And the illustrations of the Tennessee shows that he's dipping down into Georgia, which he doesn't have sex done.

28:31.195 --> 28:33.137
It might have late in that, if he corrected.

28:33.157 --> 28:35.580
And then he had all of them.

28:35.915 --> 28:43.303
problems straightened down as it was a strife, and the books were delivered in time to make the signing of the morning.

28:43.323 --> 28:47.607
It went out with great difficulties.

28:47.647 --> 28:52.432
I began to see him as a perfectionist with a poltergeist.

28:54.654 --> 29:05.365
But it all worked out at the end and so well that in one of his letters on this period, and I brought this to you

29:05.986 --> 29:09.434
He writes, God bless the editors.

29:10.476 --> 29:18.555
Those were the cases.

29:18.575 --> 29:21.582
On the wall, this is another.

29:22.169 --> 29:25.933
It's a challenge to find in our timeframe.

29:26.773 --> 29:32.899
We have good materials from our collection to other agencies to give it.

29:32.919 --> 29:38.845
And I've found, oh, my goodness, you're a three-year-old lead time with these registrar's documents and so forth.

29:38.865 --> 29:39.605
Nothing like that.

29:41.147 --> 29:44.750
So I'm trying to find the fearless map somewhere.

29:44.950 --> 29:51.096
And I found the Library of Congress and the New York Public were willing to let us borrow the map.

29:51.076 --> 30:02.595
But the time was too short to go through all of the originating documentation, the reservations, work that would have to be done on the ship and so on.

30:03.496 --> 30:05.659
So we weren't able to do that.

30:05.680 --> 30:10.928
And I was rather desperately searching in upon a treasured librarian's tool.

30:10.948 --> 30:15.936
And I hope some of you will enjoy it, too.

30:16.203 --> 30:19.308
where was I going to find the map of the river.

30:20.249 --> 30:31.466
And so I checked in the pre-1956 imprint, and there it was, Cleveland Public Library.

30:32.006 --> 30:39.538
And it's all there, and they were willing to allow us to have their map.

30:39.558 --> 30:44.505
They developed a nice picture and a very fine copy of the map.

30:44.840 --> 30:55.415
And on either side of it, we use another technique to provide images that we employ.

30:55.915 --> 31:08.012
And that is taking a polaroid shot in this instance of the jacket of the

31:08.228 --> 31:19.046
individual rivers booked and framed them among them, so that on either side of the map we were able to have the Kennebec and the American.

31:19.066 --> 31:23.233
And these are very interesting things.

31:27.213 --> 31:34.040
Then we came up to Carol's appearance in the gallery.

31:34.521 --> 31:41.969
You'll also see I'm sorry, but it shows well that there's a physical area of room.

31:42.109 --> 31:50.959
There's a portrait of Carol to the side of the bookcases in this exhibit.

31:51.226 --> 32:15.242
and she appeared with um that i initially had um very gracious about the exhibit and carrying with her um some items that i think of as the what are really the fruits of her labors now because she has built this collection so thoroughly and understands it so well that um

32:15.222 --> 32:25.823
Now she's into the ephemera area and every time she turns up another fragment of background or connected

32:26.562 --> 32:52.671
object but these rivers is a real thrill and so here she arrives and with her the costumes of brandy wine for the sign by the last some promotional material for the kentucky and for the members of america and we were delighted to share her joy along the way

32:53.191 --> 32:55.684
We had some other experiences.

32:56.468 --> 33:01.935
Because when you're used to an activity, you didn't help but talk about it.

33:02.135 --> 33:17.030
And coincidentally, this period had hit a time when the young man who was vaccinating the Cumberland River with what stood up to a two-hour documentary was finishing his work.

33:17.631 --> 33:20.754
He came at it for seven years of research.

33:21.515 --> 33:26.640
He felt very strongly about the river, that his

33:27.093 --> 33:32.947
story is that he was abandoned beneath the Chevy Street Bridge in Nashville.

33:32.967 --> 33:41.828
And so the general member of his mother had a great influence on who was adopted by some very nice people who brought him up well.

33:42.331 --> 33:49.203
And he's in the music system, and he brings a different kind of zest to this.

33:49.904 --> 33:58.799
But he's done a very similar job of interviewing non-liver people, and a grand job of editing this documentary.

33:59.460 --> 34:04.288
And in fact, it's so tight, it's been difficult for him to reduce it.

34:04.268 --> 34:10.996
beyond the two hours or under the two hours, so that it's a showable piece for me.

34:11.957 --> 34:24.552
But it was shown at the opening of the Tennessee Bicentennial Celebration, another coincidental event, but it was a really important tendency.

34:25.353 --> 34:31.120
And the great accomplishment of the Bicentennial was to open the space

34:31.690 --> 34:35.776
back behind the capitol to the north.

34:35.836 --> 34:39.923
The capitol building has been indulged by especially over time.

34:40.463 --> 34:41.285
But it's not killed.

34:41.605 --> 34:51.420
And behind it was a kind of ramshackle area of warehouses and, you know,

34:51.940 --> 35:13.628
So all that was cleared out, the beautifully designed Vista was created going back to a ride from Vista's away.

35:13.895 --> 35:25.474
and a young architect who designed what is really a rivers-oriented wall there.

35:25.977 --> 35:48.323
When it's completely flooded, the rivers of Tennessee will rise at the back and flow down through a landscape walkway, which shows the terrain of Tennessee from the mountains of Delta by a variety of streams.

35:48.742 --> 35:53.607
I don't want to think of one of the waterways.

35:54.228 --> 36:04.579
There's a pool, a kind of shallow pool, which has rivers of Tennessee engraved in the basin.

36:04.599 --> 36:10.646
When you drive down to the Bicentennial Ballroom, you find many children in this pool.

36:10.666 --> 36:14.530
In fact, they're watering away the rivers.

36:14.510 --> 36:17.194
They're little people.

36:17.375 --> 36:22.864
But all these people, even who are looking down, finding their own place in this world.

36:23.144 --> 36:28.753
There's a lot of what they're living here around us.

36:29.334 --> 36:38.389
Also, during this time, we had a call from a man who makes his business of searching and free marketing.

36:39.070 --> 36:40.973
And he has been to a business.

36:41.408 --> 36:50.598
market in Maryland and come up with a signature of .

36:50.779 --> 37:04.454
And he is an aficionado of the Cumberland River and particularly the logging and rafting enterprises that took place on the river.

37:04.474 --> 37:09.019
And he showed us all of these devices that we

37:09.387 --> 37:21.382
They used to keep their craft together and to guide the materials down the river and offering them tools for the exhibit.

37:21.402 --> 37:27.230
They were a little rusty for next year on the books.

37:28.151 --> 37:28.832
I thought of their time.

37:28.852 --> 37:29.733
And I didn't see a future for them.

37:29.753 --> 37:35.701
It's a trouble in the museum and science center along with the end of the century.

37:35.961 --> 37:38.905
The thing just grows wonderfully.

37:39.188 --> 37:51.685
So also during this period, he came up to the library dinner.

37:51.705 --> 37:57.433
And we're very fortunate he had a figure this year for indictment.

37:57.768 --> 38:14.243
imagine expanding her delightful remarks this morning to roughly an hour in length, you know, have some idea of what a treat that talk was for us.

38:14.263 --> 38:21.109
So we kept having music, but since I was very patient with us, allowing us to have a circle for a longer time.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.973
But it was a wonderful year of introducing

38:25.257 --> 38:32.256
people in the national area to the river.

38:32.276 --> 38:40.498
And now we have great memories of some good friends developed in Christmas Enterprise.

38:40.664 --> 38:55.450
several wonderfully usable artifacts in the image of the map, and then a videotape of the exhibit for which we've seen uses in both exhibit and educational interests.

38:58.906 --> 39:12.764
but continuing interest in the river's theme and the several of new dimensions that I didn't wait here to cross rivers every month, but very interesting.

39:12.784 --> 39:20.293
And I just went across the chain, driving up from Mexico the other day.

39:20.393 --> 39:27.242
And we have an extra question also about the engaging projects that come in this wonderful world.

39:40.030 --> 39:50.451
What Merit has reminded us about, of course, is the living tradition of rivers, which is very much part of our continuing project.

39:50.471 --> 40:00.672
She didn't mention, as we did last night, the current way that rivers are in the newspapers, which is yet a different aspect of the rivers.

40:05.039 --> 40:08.908
And that is another aspect, I think, of the continuing position.

40:08.928 --> 40:18.089
But I can't help listening to her because I was fortunate enough to hear Wilma after he's transferred to the library.

40:18.129 --> 40:19.352
And this day, it's clear that the Bible

40:20.108 --> 40:32.325
But in the monument, at the foot of the park, where there is this testimony to the rivers of Tennessee, there's also a quote from .

40:32.345 --> 40:35.789
And it gets me, I'm the big fan of quotations and descriptions.

40:36.110 --> 40:38.072
I suppose many of you are as well.

40:38.193 --> 40:45.222
But here was a whole monument dedicated to quotations about rivers and water.

40:47.986 --> 40:51.473
But we're all part of it.

40:51.633 --> 40:58.526
And I came across this not knowing it was there, and that I was towards the river.

40:58.546 --> 41:05.560
I think there's been a year 10 feet of the way I had.

41:05.580 --> 41:06.482
And I think it's going to come to the region.

41:06.502 --> 41:06.862
It's really a hit.

41:06.882 --> 41:07.243
Yeah, I'm so good.

41:07.763 --> 41:18.558
I would like now to invite the illustrators who are here to come up to the stage.

41:19.580 --> 41:24.326
And we are going to continue from this aspect of the illustration.

41:24.547 --> 41:31.797
And by the illustrators, our discussion of this part of the Rivers of America series.

41:32.117 --> 41:36.083
And we have, in addition to Jerry Tassard and Troy,

41:36.063 --> 41:54.122
I would like to have all reading children as well for my interviews last night.

41:54.102 --> 42:23.417
we also have family members i know both the authors and real estate and we hope to have a chance if not this morning at the end of the day get some more comments from us associated with

42:23.397 --> 42:41.525
We started by getting about illustration.

42:41.625 --> 42:50.198
We could ask each of our illustrators in turn, perhaps, to answer their size the same question I ask the authors.

42:50.178 --> 43:18.497
how they came to illustrate the work which they illustrated and the alternations that they might like to make about the process, about the illustrations that they showed, and how that relationship was with the illustrator and the author, and anything else they would like to say about the publishing process for the book.

43:18.477 --> 43:21.601
And I think George, it's all right.

43:21.621 --> 43:26.227
We can go the other way today and start with you and do that.

43:28.270 --> 43:32.516
You know, this is something I haven't read about.

43:32.816 --> 43:34.839
It's 37 years ago.

43:34.859 --> 43:40.226
It's a little shock to see it all turn in.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.413
I did an illustration for her.

43:46.793 --> 43:55.482
advertising agencies and editorial publishers.

43:55.502 --> 44:14.320
And one day I left my portfolio that called Reinhard and In there was a book called Yankee Loggers, which Stuart Holbrook wrote, and I illustrated along the quote.

44:17.118 --> 44:25.368
A few days went by and I got a call and said that they would like me to go to space reality.

44:28.151 --> 44:37.202
So unlike the other authors who had some contact with them, I never had any contact with them.

44:39.264 --> 44:44.631
I felt I was an art editor, but I didn't show my samples.

44:44.651 --> 44:46.433
I don't know.

44:48.033 --> 44:55.706
And I don't know when it feels crazy.

44:56.607 --> 45:00.654
But that's roughly what happened.

45:00.674 --> 45:02.376
So is it a separate negotiation entirely?

45:02.396 --> 45:04.099
Is he being sealed with the author at all?

45:04.320 --> 45:05.822
No, not at all.

45:10.814 --> 45:26.312
David, do you want to respond to that?

45:26.913 --> 45:27.996
Yes.

45:29.663 --> 45:33.730
I did have the privilege to interview Lou.

45:33.810 --> 45:43.788
I called him in Rockport, Maine, on Valentine's Day, as it happens this year, sitting in the kitchen of his home, overlooking .

45:43.808 --> 45:49.919
That was one of the questions I asked.

45:49.939 --> 45:54.287
What do you have to do with the illustrations of the illustrator?

45:54.571 --> 45:57.797
Nothing.

45:57.817 --> 46:00.862
When you think of the work, he said, I thought it was first class.

46:01.103 --> 46:16.630
It showed that the illustrator knew something about the work, the work of working in the woods, that is, which is a big part of what the Allogast story was about working in the Jordan-Masel-Lumberwood.

46:17.352 --> 46:28.813
And as George told me yesterday, when we did an interview here at the library, he just explained a moment ago, the fact that he had done this earlier, was really instrumented here.

46:29.806 --> 46:42.585
And you might want to comment on the fact that some of the illustrations in the first book served as marvelous for illustrations in the second book, right?

46:42.605 --> 46:51.358
And I'm thinking of one of the characters that you know, who each wrote about a pretty legendary character of a walker there in the book.

46:52.199 --> 46:56.485
But just to say again, really respectful.

46:56.885 --> 47:04.555
Well, actually, this job was a big help because they are a huge company in the area.

47:04.575 --> 47:14.388
And they had tons of photographs of his stars online, which were a tremendous thing.

47:14.488 --> 47:17.532
And I can fall back on those when I did the alligator.

47:18.541 --> 47:28.580
And for Lou to do his work, and this is a very remote area in Maine, very sparkly populated in my home state, incidentally.

47:29.341 --> 47:33.169
By the way, I grew up on the bank, but that's fine by.

47:34.411 --> 47:37.056
But anyway, for Lou to do his research,

47:37.222 --> 47:55.508
it was necessary for him to obtain permissions from the lumber companies, including International Paper Company, which turns out to be the firm that commissioned the book that George did the illustration for .

47:55.529 --> 47:56.230
So we have that cost current .

47:57.852 --> 48:03.099
Yeah, I must say this is just a happy incident.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.925
And 30 years later, you can see .

48:14.431 --> 48:42.480
coming after all these people who are authors that were so eloquent, I feel, because, you know, it's still sort of like a list with any of the separate customs, and authors who were

48:43.169 --> 48:56.085
But at the time that the war with Germany ended, I was in the hospital.

48:56.105 --> 49:02.913
And I expected to be shipped over to Japan to help clean up that mess.

49:02.933 --> 49:05.376
And that was a result that I didn't want to talk.

49:05.396 --> 49:05.937
So I went over.

49:05.917 --> 49:16.011
transferred to the Stars of Christ to learn newspaper, and shortly found myself in a little town in Germany, the Altdorf, which is your murderer.

49:16.362 --> 49:28.440
And Dick Jones was the editor of a magazine session, and I was the art director on it.

49:28.460 --> 49:31.585
So he and I got along really well, and I got a point of commitment.

49:31.605 --> 49:39.957
And then many years later, when he got the chance to do the Minnesota River Book, and they were looking for a new dating from Minnesota,

49:39.937 --> 49:52.775
He called me up and asked me if I wanted to do it.

49:52.795 --> 49:53.817
And I said, sure.

49:53.837 --> 49:54.939
So that's how I happened to do it.

49:54.959 --> 50:01.288
And my wife and I, her information on any better than mine, and she thinks we've spent about a week along the river, but I think it was much longer than that.

50:01.308 --> 50:04.532
We went along the river making sketches of everything that we saw.

50:04.552 --> 50:05.033
And I tried to make them

50:05.215 --> 50:16.879
look like sketches done on the spot.

50:16.899 --> 50:19.203
Some of them weren't, some of them weren't.

50:19.223 --> 50:25.536
But anyway, I just did a whole lot of interesting points along the river and sketches of people, pioneers and engines and so forth that have been

50:25.938 --> 50:37.672
problems in the settling of the reverse, and that went into heaven, and they picked out the money they wanted to use.

50:37.692 --> 50:46.883
Of course, I had read this book, so I had some I knew what he was talking about, so that's how I had it.

50:52.550 --> 50:58.770
Did you know that as well?

50:58.951 --> 51:05.713
Oh, yeah, because we did work on this person first.

51:05.733 --> 51:05.833
Yeah.

51:06.573 --> 51:29.644
An interesting thing, we have, we worked at a printing plant that had been the printing plant for Victor Sturmer, his arms, his parting paper, and we have the same typologies and the same press room and the same types of his and the whole shred that he had, and of course none of them have ever been adopted.

51:30.147 --> 51:47.380
I'm sure everybody's pleased with the results of this.

51:49.553 --> 51:56.143
Jerry Hathard, who was an illustrator in St.

51:56.404 --> 52:00.249
Louis, from Jim Dunn and Jerry.

52:00.430 --> 52:07.921
You're not a pilot, but you're a fair little background.

52:08.142 --> 52:18.177
And like Jerry was involved in the arts in World War II, I started out to become a pilot.

52:18.730 --> 52:30.234
And I went through my 10 hours flying and the college education and so forth, found out in San Diego, California, where I got probably the worst cold of my life.

52:31.376 --> 52:37.088
And wound up with a heavy duty sinus problem and couldn't get through the pressure chambers.

52:37.909 --> 52:39.793
So I'm chucked out of state.

52:43.334 --> 52:53.610
And I wound up, I finagled my way over to England, ultimately, to have an aircraft armor with the 8th Air Force.

52:53.630 --> 53:00.080
And like everything else, I had about 50,000 aircraft armors in excess over there.

53:01.062 --> 53:07.292
And my captain asked if I was good for anything, was anything I could have.

53:07.552 --> 53:07.893
What?

53:07.913 --> 53:08.093
What?

53:08.866 --> 53:11.670
And I said, well, I fancy myself as an artist.

53:11.690 --> 53:18.200
I've taken art of pretty much all these great people in high school and a couple of summer sessions.

53:18.460 --> 53:20.082
And he literally floated.

53:20.202 --> 53:22.085
He handed me the keys to his chief.

53:22.105 --> 53:23.067
He took out his wallet.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.328
He said, buy whatever you want.

53:24.348 --> 53:25.029
He had so much.

53:25.590 --> 53:27.453
It's such a great mean for art.

53:27.673 --> 53:30.177
I didn't really tell him about it.

53:30.297 --> 53:34.403
So I wound up doing all kinds of interesting projects.

53:34.864 --> 53:36.426
I decorated the chapel.

53:36.912 --> 53:44.652
One extreme, designs 3D posters, and lots of little things that were great.

53:45.293 --> 53:49.524
And they kept me working night and day.

53:49.544 --> 53:50.787
Anyway.

53:51.239 --> 53:58.508
When I got out of the service, I went to my education at Mayapolis School of Art, College of Art.

53:58.608 --> 54:09.040
And after years of supporting my family as an artist, pretty adequately, I got this call from Jim Dunn.

54:09.060 --> 54:13.225
And he explained that they had an artist on this project who had passed away.

54:13.486 --> 54:18.732
It's not the first time I placed I could film.

54:19.235 --> 54:26.902
I must say that the experience that I had with Jim and with Gene Crawford was one of the nicest ones of my whole career.

54:27.623 --> 54:32.847
I can't imagine a few more helpful people on any kind of project.

54:32.867 --> 54:44.658
I mean, some of these things, I think, as my fellows, my peers here know about some of the conditions that I already put up with.

54:45.379 --> 54:48.702
And it was really a pleasant experience.

54:49.019 --> 54:50.380
I'm working with these two people.

54:50.400 --> 55:04.514
Jim came to my office with two large boxes of archives, let's say, assembled by his father, who was quite a photographer, as Jim was, and a writer of his own, right?

55:04.695 --> 55:05.896
Sort of good.

55:05.956 --> 55:06.136
St.

55:06.256 --> 55:06.877
Troy?

55:06.997 --> 55:07.077
St.

55:07.097 --> 55:09.139
Troy and areas surrounding it.

55:09.700 --> 55:15.145
And his writings, which was not quite as good as Jim,

55:15.479 --> 55:17.681
And we're very good.

55:17.742 --> 55:35.401
His father documented the arrival of all the and so forth that came out of the river, and all the birds, and all the things that happened, and all the occurrences of the logging industry, and so on.

55:36.262 --> 55:41.588
And we had some nice little meetings, talked about what that happened.

55:46.090 --> 55:49.874
came up with some really nice solutions with Jean.

55:50.715 --> 55:56.821
Jean asked how I would like to do, what would be my preference for style of drawings.

55:56.842 --> 56:00.786
And she said, usually they are a candidate target.

56:01.747 --> 56:11.157
I said, well, I'd like to try something different, and I'll do a couple drawings submitted to you and see if you like it.

56:12.058 --> 56:14.140
And so I did, I think, three drawings.

56:14.727 --> 56:19.734
And we set them on her, and she fired a letter back saying, go ahead, they're great.

56:19.754 --> 56:22.497
And this was very nice, very complimentary.

56:23.198 --> 56:26.483
And there was also the business arrangement.

56:26.503 --> 56:34.293
I think publishers, of course, we do not say, illustrators as well as some other sorts of corporations do.

56:35.194 --> 56:38.219
And so I am being polite here.

56:38.879 --> 56:39.140
I don't know.

56:39.260 --> 56:42.304
I think it's the nature of the ..

56:43.381 --> 56:59.471
And I said, what I want to do is retain ownership of those loans.

57:00.052 --> 57:05.001
And what I'll do is a trade-off.

57:13.942 --> 57:16.586
And he said, great.

57:16.606 --> 57:22.154
And then I'll add about four more drawings, if you've got room for them, in the book, which I did.

57:23.376 --> 57:27.041
That was a very long situation.

57:27.061 --> 57:33.491
And I was able to sell the drawings, a number of them, for up to three or four times as well.

57:34.192 --> 57:36.796
I can't say it originally.

57:37.176 --> 57:39.280
By the penalty.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.962
That's basically my story.

57:41.785 --> 57:59.992
I can remind the audience that we do have copies of the book and our authors on display here.

58:02.095 --> 58:08.805
And the books over here are from the collections of the Library of Congress.

58:09.089 --> 58:17.697
aired, and the books on the other side are from Gerald's collection.

58:17.717 --> 58:19.699
They're not going to be picked up.

58:19.719 --> 58:36.794
You wanted to because we just had to put those things lived on the vivid cases, but you'll get a feeling of the covers, at least, and for the books as the logic, which, again, a book series is part of what makes this series.

58:36.814 --> 58:37.995
So in practice, they are a series.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.096
They look like a series.

58:39.076 --> 58:42.630
And as the series evolves, we are now learning.

58:42.650 --> 58:49.457
There were many changes internally, but the series basically won that.

58:51.344 --> 58:58.013
Aaron, for the gentleman, to Aaron Kessler, who was the illustrator for the Merrimack.

58:58.674 --> 59:07.886
The author of the Merrimack was Raymond C. Goldman, and the Merrimack was the public designer.

59:09.128 --> 59:15.576
Well, I grew up on the shores of Easter, but I don't know.

59:15.596 --> 59:16.137
Oh, I don't know.

59:16.336 --> 59:28.173
That, for a while, was probably my involvement with Rivers.

59:28.554 --> 59:32.159
I never met Raymond Colvin.

59:32.179 --> 59:37.307
I never led a theology of the world.

59:37.327 --> 59:43.356
I was about four years out of school at that point.

59:43.376 --> 59:44.858
And I had been involved in public.

59:45.597 --> 01:00:07.065
I got involved in book publishing daily as a designer of book jackets around 1865.

01:00:08.058 --> 01:00:12.648
And I really love your work, and that seems to be the trade-off.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:19.644
Publishing allows you to do things you couldn't really like to do.

01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:25.257
It's a much greater arena for an artist.

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:33.536
And I had had the experience of working with several of them, rather directly.

01:00:33.757 --> 01:00:37.302
I worked with one of the male for a while.

01:00:37.322 --> 01:00:40.086
That's a whole other story.

01:00:41.147 --> 01:00:48.538
I did the first, actually, which was a tough one.

01:00:49.799 --> 01:00:51.582
And I had sort of a...

01:00:52.085 --> 01:00:59.093
history of doing stuff like choppy jacks as fast as time.

01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:03.097
At the same time, I was living it.

01:01:03.237 --> 01:01:04.278
Like I say, I loved it.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:11.906
And I had worked for a short time for Ben Thader, who was the art editor of the series.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:17.232
And I guess it must have been surely

01:01:20.283 --> 01:01:31.099
So he called me, and apparently someone had no idea to illustrate the book, and for some reason he couldn't do it.

01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:35.586
And he urged me to do it, and I didn't want to do it.

01:01:36.367 --> 01:01:41.454
I had real doubts about my ability to illustrate a book and to do it.

01:01:42.256 --> 01:01:46.662
And he just, I was kind of pushed into it, I think.

01:01:46.878 --> 01:01:50.242
But it was kind of a new and interesting thing.

01:01:51.002 --> 01:01:56.048
And I had no, I met, I must have known the people of my heart.

01:01:56.068 --> 01:02:02.254
And I knew some of them because I didn't know what those people were.

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:07.199
And I knew things for them, and I had to be one of the people of my heart.

01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:11.704
And interestingly enough, I guess that speaks about publishing at a time when somebody

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:20.504
It was still less than a year ago, but he couldn't have direct contact with principals.

01:02:22.747 --> 01:02:26.213
At any rate, he convinced me to do it.

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:38.653
And I don't recall exactly who I met with at Barnhart, but I was given a very kind of group

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.280
of what I had to do.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.230
I don't think I had seen another river
