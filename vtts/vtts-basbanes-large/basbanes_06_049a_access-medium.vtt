00:03.085 --> 00:12.700
This is the first book to have illustrations of the military nature.

00:13.562 --> 00:17.147
And they're the first line illustrations.

00:17.167 --> 00:19.090
Now, these are all incunables, you said, right?

00:19.110 --> 00:20.132
These are all incunables.

00:20.332 --> 00:21.474
And with this whole?

00:21.815 --> 00:22.756
Just this section right here.

00:22.776 --> 00:23.517
This whole section?

00:23.637 --> 00:25.020
Yeah, we have 5,000 of them.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.203
These are just some of the more famous ones.

00:27.605 --> 00:28.566
You know what incunables are?

00:28.586 --> 00:30.129
They're books published prior to 1500.

00:30.169 --> 00:33.153
These are line engravings showing military apparatus.

00:33.654 --> 00:36.238
It's considered the first great military book ever published.

00:36.258 --> 00:37.720
And it's had a little bit, once again?

00:37.740 --> 00:40.605
Oh, Volturi is day military, day ring military.

00:42.187 --> 00:43.108
Yeah, they're batting rams.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.671
They're really batting rams.

00:44.691 --> 00:45.672
I've never seen them.

00:45.692 --> 00:47.695
And that was probably contemporary military stuff.

00:47.715 --> 00:52.362
I think Leonardo used this book, actually, as an example.

00:52.422 --> 00:53.885
This is the great Subiaco.

00:53.905 --> 00:56.228
We had the first book printed in Italy.

00:57.878 --> 00:58.919
Oh, this really gets me.

01:02.242 --> 01:04.424
We put these gaps here because of earthquakes.

01:04.444 --> 01:06.566
We don't want them to fall off.

01:07.007 --> 01:16.316
The last two earthquakes in Whittier and the one out in the valley, books tumble off.

01:16.656 --> 01:17.817
We have a major one.

01:17.837 --> 01:19.739
We just don't want to stick with the spines.

01:19.759 --> 01:20.720
How far down are we again?

01:20.760 --> 01:22.502
Two levels beneath the ground about what you said?

01:22.522 --> 01:24.243
This was built and designed by Caltech.

01:24.744 --> 01:25.945
Uh-huh, which is right down the street.

01:27.005 --> 01:28.206
These are great early.

01:28.226 --> 01:29.968
This is our English book collections here.

01:29.988 --> 01:33.772
These are pre-1640 imprints.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.114
And this is the heart and soul of our collections.

01:35.134 --> 01:37.276
I was going to say one of the great strengths of the collection.

01:37.296 --> 01:38.097
Yes, English books.

01:38.117 --> 01:40.439
I mean, they're sensational books here.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.062
There's the Hackwood's Voyages.

01:43.082 --> 01:45.044
Oh, there's the Hackwood's Voyages.

01:45.325 --> 01:50.010
This is the Bateman upon Bartholomew.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.052
That's when Ship of Fools by Pinson.

01:53.674 --> 01:56.016
You know, the primary fool is in the Ship of Fools.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.547
The bibliomaniacs.

01:57.567 --> 01:58.368
Is that right?

01:58.388 --> 01:58.688
That's true.

01:58.708 --> 01:59.089
That's right.

01:59.529 --> 02:00.610
Anyway, there's a great thing.

02:00.730 --> 02:04.554
These are great foreign books after 1500.

02:04.674 --> 02:09.158
There's a wonderful Palladio.

02:10.119 --> 02:11.240
There's Agricola.

02:13.562 --> 02:17.206
Ray Metallica, the first engineering book on mining.

02:17.226 --> 02:21.330
Isn't that the name of Hoover's collection over at Claremont?

02:21.430 --> 02:21.810
Right.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.852
He had it reprinted.

02:23.872 --> 02:24.012
Uh-huh.

02:24.835 --> 02:26.577
Then there's all kinds of things.

02:26.597 --> 02:32.205
There's Martin Luther, and there's later editions of Don Quixote and Galileo's Dialogue.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.527
Do you have the first Don Quixote?

02:33.627 --> 02:34.188
No, no.

02:34.228 --> 02:36.150
There's a story about that.

02:37.131 --> 02:47.225
Huntington had it in the church collection, and an archer who started the Hispanic Society had an English edition of Don Quixote, so they traded it.

02:49.648 --> 02:51.771
And that's now the Hispanic Society of New York.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.240
There were only six of those.

02:53.881 --> 02:55.083
Ah, yeah, they're very few.

02:55.123 --> 02:56.785
Very few.

02:56.865 --> 02:58.548
The Garden went for one and a half million.

02:59.729 --> 03:00.490
The Garden City?

03:00.671 --> 03:02.513
Yeah, 1.5 million.

03:02.954 --> 03:03.454
Yeah.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.656
To a Spanish collector.

03:05.197 --> 03:07.560
Yeah, they're very, very hard.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.062
Are these also in Canada?

03:09.122 --> 03:11.105
These are early American books.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.927
Most of these are from the church collection.

03:12.987 --> 03:15.471
This is, let me show you.

03:16.432 --> 03:20.177
I've got a couple here.

03:20.197 --> 03:20.998
No, no, this is fine.

03:21.367 --> 03:35.147
This is a very scarce book.

03:35.488 --> 03:42.217
The University of Virginia and the Huntington's own account of this, as far as I can find out, in this country.

03:42.538 --> 03:48.066
This is the prose, I mean the poetic account of Columbus's letter.

03:48.417 --> 03:48.857
Oh.

03:48.877 --> 03:49.838
Translated in 1495.

03:50.018 --> 03:51.760
There's only a couple of these.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.201
This is three years after the discovery.

03:53.221 --> 03:53.642
Right, right.

03:54.002 --> 03:55.143
Here's the illustration.

03:55.183 --> 03:55.643
Woodcut.

03:55.663 --> 03:57.285
It's a wonderful little book.

03:57.685 --> 04:03.951
There's the translated from Latin into Italian whole poetry.

04:04.371 --> 04:05.953
Who bound this, would you say?

04:05.993 --> 04:09.456
Oh, this is late 19... It's typical church copy.

04:09.476 --> 04:10.236
Oh, it's church.

04:10.256 --> 04:10.437
Okay.

04:10.717 --> 04:11.578
Here's his book plate.

04:11.858 --> 04:13.239
And he had a lot of his books be done.

04:13.439 --> 04:14.961
And give me just the title of it again.

04:14.981 --> 04:17.563
It's Dottie's...

04:17.881 --> 04:19.743
D-A-T-I.

04:20.164 --> 04:21.005
Uh-huh.

04:21.165 --> 04:23.588
It's his, I don't know the exact title.

04:24.069 --> 04:25.671
How would you, what would you call it?

04:25.831 --> 04:28.855
It's a poetic translation of the letter of Prince Christopher Columbus.

04:28.875 --> 04:29.396
1495?

04:29.416 --> 04:29.756
1495.

04:29.876 --> 04:30.417
Printed where?

04:31.398 --> 04:32.820
I think it's from Florence.

04:33.321 --> 04:34.342
There it is right there.

04:35.344 --> 04:35.724
Great book.

04:36.585 --> 04:37.386
Congratulations.

04:37.446 --> 04:38.087
One of only two?

04:38.828 --> 04:45.036
In this country, as far as I've been able to find out right away, but there's other wonderful books here.

04:45.758 --> 04:47.741
Alan, give me your title again.

04:48.101 --> 04:52.567
And it's J-U-T-S-S-E-Z-I.

04:53.068 --> 04:55.031
And your middle initial?

04:55.051 --> 04:57.975
No, H. And you use two L's with Alan?

04:59.477 --> 05:01.099
A-L-A-N.

05:01.179 --> 05:04.644
These are the folio books.

05:06.306 --> 05:13.015
We have all these copies of Ptolemy's Geography because the early maps of the New World are included in these.

05:13.518 --> 05:14.139
Can we see one?

05:14.560 --> 05:15.441
Let me see.

05:15.801 --> 05:19.187
The great, brilliant one with the big... Well, these aren't real.

05:19.207 --> 05:22.351
These are some of the later ones, actually.

05:26.017 --> 05:30.404
Let me see.

05:30.444 --> 05:33.128
This is worth a trip right here.

05:33.148 --> 05:37.594
These are early, this looks like a Cortez letter.

05:38.195 --> 05:39.998
Again, it came in the church collection.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.212
How do you have these categorized?

05:42.232 --> 05:48.939
These are all American books organized essentially by date.

05:48.959 --> 05:52.042
1506 is the first one here.

05:52.703 --> 05:55.286
And in this book, America is mentioned.

05:55.306 --> 05:58.389
These are really accounts of the New World.

05:58.809 --> 06:01.712
And this is Cortez's account of the conquering of Mexico City.

06:01.732 --> 06:03.955
How do you feel when you handle these?

06:03.975 --> 06:07.278
Even after all these years, it's wonderful.

06:08.279 --> 06:09.040
See, there's the...

06:09.880 --> 06:14.885
letter of Cortez telling about his experiences.

06:14.905 --> 06:16.387
Cortez in the New World.

06:16.647 --> 06:17.348
In the New World.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.673
We have a big Columbus exhibit going up because we have such a wonderful collection.

06:23.374 --> 06:25.576
Our collection is a lot like the New York public.

06:25.636 --> 06:26.477
John Carter Brown.

06:27.858 --> 06:31.862
This is the Elliott Indian Bible.

06:31.882 --> 06:34.104
This is a later copy of it.

06:34.124 --> 06:36.887
But we have all different kinds of things.

06:36.907 --> 06:38.689
There's Almanacs.

06:40.188 --> 06:54.930
This is the first, for example, this is the first road atlas ever printed in the New World, and it was, I mean, in America, and it was done about 17, this is about 1787.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.432
It's beautiful.

06:56.612 --> 06:58.275
Yeah, it just shows the road from New York.

06:59.937 --> 07:02.581
How are those illustrations done?

07:03.342 --> 07:06.307
I think they're in gray, Dutch.

07:08.570 --> 07:09.351
This is the...

07:09.635 --> 07:11.858
The first map ever done is 1780.

07:12.059 --> 07:14.763
The manuscript map of Gilson's map of Kentucky.

07:16.005 --> 07:18.028
You see all these poor Richard's almanacs.

07:18.048 --> 07:21.954
These all came to the church sale.

07:21.974 --> 07:22.675
Do you have a full run?

07:22.915 --> 07:23.776
Pretty much full run.

07:23.796 --> 07:26.861
You know, the library company doesn't, for instance, in Philadelphia.

07:27.762 --> 07:29.064
There's children's books.

07:29.084 --> 07:31.869
Here's a little children's book.

07:32.790 --> 07:32.890
1775.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.074
And again, most of them are church.

07:35.314 --> 07:37.397
Oh, this is quite later, but even so.

07:38.221 --> 07:43.869
We have the first known edition of Cinderella here.

07:45.451 --> 07:48.094
It's The History of the Little Goody Two Shoes.

07:49.476 --> 07:55.725
We don't have as large a collection of children's books, but we have some... Does it compare to the Morgans?

07:55.805 --> 07:57.607
Morgans are pretty spectacular.

07:57.647 --> 07:59.410
They got their, I think, from the ball.

08:02.854 --> 08:07.941
But these are... We have a variety of copies.

08:08.174 --> 08:12.802
Thomas Jefferson's own copy of the Journal of the House of Milk.

08:12.822 --> 08:16.448
So we have a lot of books that are owned by important people.

08:16.468 --> 08:19.272
This is the treasure room, would you say?

08:19.352 --> 08:21.356
No, the vault is in there.

08:22.437 --> 08:24.301
You want to go back there?

08:26.264 --> 08:27.125
Yeah, maybe.

08:27.145 --> 08:28.507
We came here just for this.

08:30.250 --> 08:34.958
But we're two of the few people in the world that actually travel across the country to look at books.

08:35.866 --> 09:02.599
mr jesse is now opening an enormous vault at least three feet thick you know the walls here are like eight or twelve feet you can see anyway

09:05.127 --> 09:10.812
This is the treasure room.

09:12.174 --> 09:16.258
And I would say, I would estimate about 18 feet by 12 feet.

09:16.298 --> 09:19.581
Is that a fair estimate?

09:19.601 --> 09:22.403
These are all the Shakespeare quartos.

09:22.864 --> 09:24.405
These are all the Shakespeare folios.

09:26.247 --> 09:27.028
This is the first.

09:27.048 --> 09:30.311
This is the great dossier right here.

09:30.391 --> 09:32.653
This is the first.

09:33.460 --> 09:38.345
This is the first laws of the state of New York, of which I think there's only one other copy in the world.

09:39.986 --> 09:40.567
Maybe not.

09:40.587 --> 09:41.808
I think there's one other.

09:42.389 --> 09:47.914
But it's published by Bradford in 1694.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.756
It's a fairly bad shape.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.339
That's darn close to being an American incunable.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.021
Well, Michael Zinman, you know Michael?

09:55.782 --> 10:00.767
Michael calls these things American, which is not bad, you know.

10:01.557 --> 10:09.249
These, you know that big book we have at home, the white book, the facsimile of the Shakespeare Quarter at the Huntington Library, that's what these are from.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.513
This is the great, this is the best copy we have.

10:13.174 --> 10:17.381
It's missing a page, but it includes, it's in the original.

10:17.461 --> 10:19.764
How many, first roll is, do you have?

10:19.784 --> 10:20.165
Yeah, four.

10:21.407 --> 10:22.649
This is the Bridgewater copy.

10:22.669 --> 10:25.273
See, this is almost pretty much like it was originally.

10:25.433 --> 10:27.556
Well, it looks like it's an original binding.

10:27.576 --> 10:28.017
Yeah.

10:28.037 --> 10:28.317
It is?

10:28.397 --> 10:28.898
Pretty close.

10:30.548 --> 10:38.976
The great English library he got was the Bridgewater Library, which is the greatest family library ever put together in England.

10:38.996 --> 10:41.458
He bought it at Lock, Stock and Barrow in 1917.

10:41.898 --> 10:42.699
There's the bookmark.

10:42.719 --> 10:43.259
1917.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.642
Can we just see the Drosshut portrait?

10:46.342 --> 10:48.244
That'll always give us a little kick.

10:48.384 --> 10:48.864
There it is.

10:50.486 --> 10:57.292
See, it feels as though the book is actually... John, within seven years of figures death.

10:57.312 --> 11:00.555
It just does it, doesn't it?

11:01.058 --> 11:03.401
See, it's breaking right here.

11:03.902 --> 11:08.969
It's broken a little more since I've been here.

11:09.209 --> 11:09.950
I don't let it out.

11:10.030 --> 11:13.355
Do you do any kind of repair on these?

11:13.495 --> 11:15.798
Oh, yeah.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.384
These copies of these books, here's the D, the Duke of Devonshire.

11:20.745 --> 11:23.729
That was another great collection.

11:23.809 --> 11:28.095
You have here Bridgewater Church in Devonshire.

11:28.632 --> 11:30.274
There's all kinds of other books here.

11:30.354 --> 11:34.478
This is the only known copy of Tom Jones in the original boards.

11:35.579 --> 11:41.886
This is the great Getty's Burns, which includes maybe 20 or 30 manuscript poems by Burns.

11:42.147 --> 11:45.130
Manuscript poems.

11:45.150 --> 11:53.779
The Alice, the first Alice, the Letters of Cumbolumbus, the Besson book, the Letters of

11:54.383 --> 11:56.825
The different editions of The Letters of Columbus.

11:56.845 --> 11:59.387
There's one going on, so that's a Besson book.

11:59.407 --> 12:00.408
This is a Besson book.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.252
That's the first book printed in North America, period.

12:04.272 --> 12:08.536
1629 or something like that?

12:08.556 --> 12:08.816
1640.

12:08.836 --> 12:09.637
1640.

12:09.657 --> 12:10.577
The Elliot Bible.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.824
This is a Mather Tracks that was actually owned by the family.

12:17.844 --> 12:21.187
Of course, the American Antiquarian Society says this library.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.749
Milton, the first of Walton's Angler.

12:24.252 --> 12:28.418
The poem Tamerlane.

12:29.179 --> 12:29.940
That's Tamerlane?

12:30.782 --> 12:32.564
Yes, Tamerlane.

12:32.584 --> 12:38.353
And these are all Pinson and Caxton, works of... Where are the Caxton's?

12:38.653 --> 12:38.994
Right here.

12:39.214 --> 12:41.097
First book printed in English language.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.220
How many Caxton's here?

12:43.661 --> 12:45.263
I don't know for sure.

12:46.425 --> 12:47.747
He's England's first printer.

12:47.807 --> 12:48.809
He's England's Gutenberg.

12:49.289 --> 12:50.411
These are black books here.

12:50.952 --> 12:53.095
What's the significance of that book of Key's poems?

12:53.817 --> 12:57.643
It's probably on the regional boards and maybe a presentation copy.

12:57.723 --> 13:03.571
It's not open.

13:03.591 --> 13:04.252
It's my own now.

13:04.412 --> 13:04.653
Okay.

13:09.399 --> 13:11.623
Yeah, I don't know what this is.

13:11.643 --> 13:12.965
It's an original board.

13:13.045 --> 13:14.948
It looks like it's in pretty nice shape.

13:14.968 --> 13:15.448
Yeah, it is.

13:18.132 --> 13:22.238
Yeah, these are real, really cool actors.

13:22.842 --> 13:25.506
Researchers, not students.

13:25.526 --> 13:26.587
Researchers.

13:26.828 --> 13:28.129
This side is all manuscripts.

13:28.170 --> 13:33.938
We have the great collection of letters of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln.

13:35.099 --> 13:37.062
Where's Franklin's autobiography?

13:37.623 --> 13:39.245
It must be on display.

13:39.666 --> 13:42.810
This is Walden by Thoreau.

13:42.830 --> 13:43.772
Oh, that's the manuscripts?

13:43.792 --> 13:43.952
Right.

13:44.793 --> 13:46.355
This is one of the great literary manuscripts.

13:46.375 --> 13:51.803
It wasn't finally deciphered until the 1950s.

13:52.492 --> 13:53.973
That's Walden.

13:54.474 --> 13:55.175
That's the manuscript.

13:55.195 --> 13:56.336
That's Thoreau's hand writing.

13:57.697 --> 14:09.588
It's about 900 or 1,000 pages, and it took him forever to figure out how he really evolved until they realized he started out with a very small version and kept building the building.

14:09.608 --> 14:11.350
Was that acquired in Huntington's lifetime?

14:12.111 --> 14:14.073
Oh, almost almost is.

14:14.093 --> 14:15.514
Virtually always.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.736
Not everything.

14:17.796 --> 14:21.840
This is the Prince of the Popper, Mark Twain, Samuel Coltridge's

14:22.310 --> 14:24.352
The Hotline Correspondents.

14:24.372 --> 14:29.376
Hotline Correspondents, yeah, that's a great group of correspondents.

14:29.457 --> 14:37.484
In the early Clemens Correspondents with the person who was on his trip to around the world with him.

14:37.504 --> 14:40.387
There's the Manuscript of Lord of Doom.

14:40.407 --> 14:41.948
This is pretty spectacular.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.470
This is a pretty spectacular treasure in the world.

14:44.490 --> 14:48.954
Oh yeah, those are early Portland charts, medieval manuscripts.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.777
We have a great collection of English medieval manuscripts there.

14:52.094 --> 14:55.078
They're the signers of the Declaration of Independence, came from Emmet.

14:55.758 --> 14:56.740
You ever talk about Thomas Emmet?

14:58.021 --> 15:00.284
Thomas Edison Emmet, a great collector.

15:00.384 --> 15:02.667
His collection, I think, went from the New York Public.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.289
But he put together sets like that.

15:05.170 --> 15:09.355
These are medieval manuscripts in English, medieval manuscripts here.

15:10.316 --> 15:14.681
A lot of books of ours, prayer books.

15:15.602 --> 15:17.945
But there are also some wonderful English texts here.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.228
We have, like, the prick of conscience.

15:20.444 --> 15:25.410
We have some of the really wonderful collections.

15:26.852 --> 15:27.993
It's all European.

15:28.013 --> 15:29.355
There's no papyri or anything.

15:30.236 --> 15:35.142
We have bits and pieces of things, but nothing.

15:35.182 --> 15:36.504
Here's the wonderful thing.

15:36.564 --> 15:38.466
George Washington's playing on Mount Vernon.

15:39.948 --> 15:45.495
We have wonderful things related to Mount Vernon because Henry bought several big collections in Washington.

15:45.515 --> 15:47.197
That's itself like HM 599.

15:47.918 --> 15:49.540
HM is how he can make the script up there.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.441
This is a treat.

15:53.481 --> 16:00.068
How often do you come down here?

16:00.728 --> 16:04.392
We occasionally get books for display.

16:08.976 --> 16:12.860
We have the first hamlet.

16:12.900 --> 16:17.164
You have both the good cordo and the bad cordo.

16:17.204 --> 16:19.746
What if you have a scholar here from

16:20.063 --> 16:23.527
from Cambridge or something and he wants to look at this.

16:23.587 --> 16:33.717
Well, most of the time they won't, but if they're working on textual things, you want to see a mark or something, they'll ask for it and they'll want to see it for now.

16:33.737 --> 16:36.920
These are all going to be published by University of California Press.

16:38.943 --> 16:44.248
We spend a lot of time making things available to two presses.

16:44.397 --> 16:46.600
And again, who owned those quartos?

16:46.660 --> 16:47.681
Whose collection was that?

16:47.701 --> 16:56.553
Well, basically, it's the Duke of Devonshire, Devonshire Library, Campbell Devonshire it's called, the Bridgewater Library.

16:57.074 --> 17:05.365
There are several copies from the Pembroke, the Bridwell sale.

17:05.385 --> 17:08.349
So it's a great variety of many people.

17:08.749 --> 17:10.812
They sold a few duplicates.

17:10.932 --> 17:12.514
The collection of quartos, I think,

17:12.798 --> 17:15.801
is superior to the Folger, isn't it?

17:15.821 --> 17:22.428
We don't have anyone near as many folios, but we've got a greater selection of quartos, if I remember correctly.

17:22.448 --> 17:27.913
I have to be persuaded that you need 100-odd more folios, you know, other than to make a Henman accent.

17:27.953 --> 17:30.156
That's right, that's right.

17:30.176 --> 17:32.077
But the quartos is really very impressive.

17:34.059 --> 17:35.561
OK, that's wonderful.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.724
Boy, that's a thrill.

17:39.805 --> 17:42.568
It is.

17:42.903 --> 17:44.986
Even safe makers.

17:45.266 --> 17:50.774
Bankers come in there, you know, when you get a repair, they say, what?

17:50.794 --> 17:51.575
For books, right?

17:53.157 --> 17:56.802
It's got to be oil.

17:58.705 --> 18:02.890
You have what appears to be a pretty extensive book plate collection here, too.

18:02.910 --> 18:08.258
Yeah, we've got a couple of big collections that people have given us, and they're not used very often.

18:09.139 --> 18:10.581
But we do a book plate collection.

18:11.455 --> 18:12.938
We have a lot of things given to us.

18:13.720 --> 18:31.776
This is a collection, the Book of Common Prayer, that was given to us by former director, and there's Book of Common Prayer books of FDR, and there's miniatures, and there's all kinds of things in the collection.

18:32.397 --> 18:35.980
You said just when we came down here that he really wasn't a treasure hunter?

18:36.060 --> 18:36.681
Did you say that?

18:36.721 --> 18:38.202
Well, no, he was not exactly.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.985
He didn't collect exactly like Morgan did.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.986
He was interested in the research library.

18:43.827 --> 18:50.053
I've got a feeling he wanted to create the greatest research library on English and American literature in the world.

18:52.175 --> 18:53.796
With the emphasis on research.

18:53.816 --> 18:56.799
Yeah, with the emphasis much different than that.

18:56.819 --> 18:59.941
Well, Mark.

18:59.961 --> 19:00.582
Mark, oh.

19:00.832 --> 19:04.417
He had a wonderful taste and really bought some of his memories.

19:05.359 --> 19:10.706
Henry went out and bought whole libraries so that he could have all those English books.

19:10.806 --> 19:13.590
Our strength is our pre-1800 English books.

19:15.754 --> 19:27.190
Now we collect archival material related to California politics, Western water rights, mining in the American West, all that kind of thing.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.535
We can order a bunch of research like very much different than the market.

19:30.818 --> 19:39.772
How and why did he get interested in it?

19:40.673 --> 19:48.806
And he seemed to have made his decision sometime in 1908, 1909, and he was going to do something like this.

19:48.826 --> 19:58.260
When he was in advanced middle age, when he, number one, he inherited the will from Collins, his uncle.

19:58.645 --> 20:03.070
Secondly, he settled in an area that he liked.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.471
He settled in Southern California.

20:04.931 --> 20:09.276
He had land holdings, tremendous land holdings, and he saw opportunity.

20:09.296 --> 20:13.140
He liked Southern California, and he thought it would be a big, big, metropolitan area.

20:13.500 --> 20:13.921
He was right.

20:14.261 --> 20:15.282
He was right.

20:15.302 --> 20:23.050
And he was involved primarily through the Pacific Electric Railroad, which he built and which then

20:23.350 --> 20:26.533
He had 24, 28 land companies in the area.

20:26.673 --> 20:27.534
All over.

20:27.554 --> 20:28.415
24, 28.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.217
I'm not sure of the number.

20:30.237 --> 20:31.839
I can't remember.

20:32.019 --> 20:37.445
So he kind of semi-retired, but kept his hand in his land companies for the rest of his life.

20:39.927 --> 20:46.314
The result was that he felt an obligation to do something, just like all the great philanthropists.

20:46.975 --> 20:51.940
And I think he had an interest in literature.

20:52.527 --> 21:19.665
and but he particularly liked these are the things that i think he liked he liked uh wonderful and beautiful books he liked um great literature and thirdly he liked material related to the founding fathers uh that's why we have such great washington and jefferson holdings and colonial holdings what when he bought the church he was buying what he was going to stay in the field he was going to stay in church had

21:19.915 --> 21:33.870
American and English literature and historical material, and he had a couple of wonderful books of ours, and he had a couple of incunables, and that essentially is the parameters that he kept the rest of his collecting career.

21:34.471 --> 21:37.034
So that's why I think the church is so important.

21:37.054 --> 21:46.564
You see in some of the correspondence that, with Rosenbach particularly, and I suspect we might see this earlier with Smith, is that

21:47.303 --> 21:53.488
Is he close yet to being as good as the British Library, or is he close yet to being the best in the world?

21:53.788 --> 21:55.130
That's right.

21:55.470 --> 22:00.294
I think he had the New York Public Library with the Astrid and Tilden collections to shoot against.

22:00.314 --> 22:04.858
He had the British Libraries to go against, and he had collectors like Morgan.

22:04.878 --> 22:07.460
Do you think he felt the competition with Morgan?

22:08.201 --> 22:09.021
No, I don't think so.

22:09.081 --> 22:10.282
I don't see it, but look at this.

22:10.302 --> 22:17.108
This is the way the Cole, George Washington, Cole cataloged his collection, you see, that he bought.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.804
Cole was his first librarian.

22:19.884 --> 22:22.509
Cole was his first librarian he was hired in 1960.

22:22.529 --> 22:26.136
So he would list a book like this and describe it.

22:28.742 --> 22:31.186
What's the name of the catalog?

22:31.287 --> 22:31.948
Oh, the catalog.

22:31.968 --> 22:33.130
Because he used facsimiles.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.535
And then he'd say other copies.

22:35.870 --> 22:38.633
British Library, Booth, Rothschild, Lennox, Ayr Library.

22:38.653 --> 22:45.001
See, immediately this was a book where compared, all the books in here were compared with copies of other places.

22:45.021 --> 22:46.443
So he gave you kind of a mini census?

22:46.824 --> 22:59.760
Yeah, this is one of the great catalogs ever produced because he gave you a census, and people like Bill Reese and all the major American county dealers frequently always referred to the church.

22:59.780 --> 23:02.603
They'll say at the bottom, the Church 111 or something like that.

23:03.022 --> 23:06.046
So, Henry Huntington loved this kind of comparison.

23:06.367 --> 23:13.216
And that's when he hired people like Brigham.

23:13.697 --> 23:15.099
He wanted to build the numbers.

23:15.419 --> 23:22.949
Brigham brought back some pretty lousy copies compared to the rest of his library, but he bought back books that were hard to find at that stage.

23:23.010 --> 23:29.198
He'd bought so many libraries by that time that he was looking for things that were tough to find, and so Clarence Brigham was able to do that.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.465
This catalog and his attitude was to compare.

23:34.627 --> 23:36.189
What volumes was that published?

23:36.650 --> 23:39.293
Well, it was five American and two English.

23:40.014 --> 23:42.037
Have you ever seen it offered for sale?

23:42.097 --> 23:44.841
No, it sells for like $1,500 or something like that.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.182
1907?

23:46.202 --> 23:50.388
Yeah, 1907 and the other one is 1909 or 1910.

23:50.869 --> 23:51.810
And then Church died.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.463
The Church family, they showed up one time.

23:55.204 --> 23:55.584
Well, they did.

23:55.604 --> 23:56.806
They lived in New Jersey.

23:56.906 --> 23:59.890
The Arm & Hammer Company operates out of New Jersey.

24:00.390 --> 24:02.633
And they showed up one time, and it was great.

24:03.013 --> 24:03.514
They came here?

24:03.734 --> 24:04.735
Yeah.

24:04.816 --> 24:06.678
And one of them remembered her father.

24:06.738 --> 24:07.719
It was her father.

24:08.460 --> 24:16.209
Oh, yeah, she was very sophisticated, Easterner, and she remembered her father riding around in Brooklyn.

24:16.890 --> 24:17.251
E.D.

24:17.331 --> 24:17.671
Church.

24:18.532 --> 24:19.934
Eliudee Church.

24:20.815 --> 24:21.696
Eliudee Church.

24:22.655 --> 24:25.519
You don't hear much about him when you hear of the great New York collectors.

24:25.559 --> 24:29.725
I mean, Ho, usually, and Brayton Ives, and Beverly Chew, and all these other guys.

24:30.266 --> 24:37.236
You know, those are the ones you hear of, but you're very... The only context you hear of this guy is because Huntington bought his, you know, on block.

24:37.556 --> 24:37.897
Right.

24:37.917 --> 24:42.383
You never hear of it because of, you know, he didn't, he wasn't, he didn't tout himself.

24:42.824 --> 24:44.466
He worked through Dodd and Mead.

24:45.187 --> 24:46.609
Which I noticed, right?

24:46.709 --> 24:47.811
Yeah, Dodd and Mead.

24:47.831 --> 24:50.755
Yeah, they have a... He bought most of his things through them.

24:50.954 --> 25:16.894
and he was private collector like unlike other people he didn't have an auction you have an auction you're minutely famous that's correct let me let me go on we want to wait here for a while or let me go and get the uh the files for you i don't think he had uh the collector that i know very well is a man named henry wagner do you ever hear you know henry wagner was a big collector of western americana he had 13 different collections

25:17.431 --> 25:19.995
And he gave his first one to Yale.

25:20.075 --> 25:24.401
He worked for the Guggenheims and gave a big economics collection to Yale in, like, 1910.

25:24.922 --> 25:30.289
He then lived on until he died at an age of 90-something in 1960.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.252
He lived right down here in San Marino.

25:32.272 --> 25:36.518
He knew Henry Huntington, and he bought things.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.824
Americana, the Henry Huntington one.

25:40.885 --> 25:42.847
They fought each other for Americana.

25:42.907 --> 25:44.029
And he said,

25:44.093 --> 25:50.042
Henry Huntington really didn't care for the American West or anything except these early documents.

25:50.663 --> 25:52.125
And he was quite right.

25:52.325 --> 25:56.451
He knew that he needed to collect them to have a great collection of Americana, so he did.

25:57.172 --> 25:59.576
But Henry Wagner knew individual items.

25:59.696 --> 26:01.319
He created the autobiographies.

26:01.359 --> 26:02.640
He wrote about his books.

26:04.243 --> 26:13.797
But Henry Huntington, on the Huntington other hand, knew a few books very well and enjoyed them.

26:14.333 --> 26:20.999
One of the books he got was Science of Shakespeare, which was only a few copies, and that he looked at.

26:21.199 --> 26:26.304
He looked at several other, George Washington's Genealogy.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.945
I've got it written down here as well.

26:28.045 --> 26:32.970
Those are the ones that he picked out to look at his first-rate collection.

26:34.351 --> 26:42.378
But he wasn't that kind of a collector where he really dug into his books, because he had time on this that was against him.

26:42.959 --> 26:44.340
He had to do all this very quickly.

26:44.607 --> 26:46.909
And because he hired people to do a lot of his work.

26:47.250 --> 26:50.874
But on the other hand, it's obvious he did a lot of his own buying.

26:50.894 --> 26:52.135
There's no question about that.

26:52.175 --> 26:55.499
He went through the whole catalogs, he went through this and that.

26:55.519 --> 26:58.702
You see wires that Rosenbach gets, I mean, Western Union.

26:59.483 --> 26:59.763
Yeah.

26:59.783 --> 27:02.126
Listed one by the Senate.

27:02.166 --> 27:02.266
Yeah.

27:02.286 --> 27:05.509
There'll be 150 lots there that he wants to bid on.

27:05.529 --> 27:08.132
And then he tells them how much he can bid on each lot.

27:08.152 --> 27:08.252
Yeah.

27:08.570 --> 27:14.756
You know, I mean, this is a man who's gone over every item in the catalog and has decided the things that he wants and how much he's willing to pay.

27:15.236 --> 27:15.957
Right, right.

27:15.977 --> 27:16.517
Absolutely.

27:16.958 --> 27:24.525
Let me, let me, I gave a talk a couple of weeks ago on early Americana at the Huntington, and it details a lot of this stuff about church.

27:25.706 --> 27:27.047
I'll make a copy of it.

27:27.087 --> 27:27.948
I'll make a copy of it.

27:27.968 --> 27:28.429
That'd be great.

27:28.909 --> 27:30.671
And, uh, I could bum a pencil.

27:31.552 --> 27:32.052
Right.

27:32.072 --> 27:32.352
Why don't you?

27:33.333 --> 27:34.895
And, and how do I identify?

27:35.435 --> 27:37.477
Well, I did, of course, say the same.

27:37.497 --> 27:38.458
No, Huntington.

27:38.911 --> 27:41.374
Now, they may have known each other by 1908.

27:41.755 --> 27:47.302
The Poresale was a fine book sale, and Henry Huntington bought some books there.

27:48.303 --> 27:50.847
By himself?

27:50.867 --> 27:51.928
Or did he have an agent there?

27:51.948 --> 27:53.630
He probably had an agent.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.954
Now, who it was, I'm not sure of.

27:55.974 --> 28:00.259
Do you think that Smith actually bought it and sold it to Huntington, or do you think it's in the cover?

28:00.540 --> 28:01.681
No, you see the contract here.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.163
Okay.

28:03.970 --> 28:07.714
So this article and this contract, we'd have to read the two.

28:08.155 --> 28:22.512
Yeah, it's not clear to me right away what the relationship is, but obviously Honey brought it directly from the church estate, and Smith was somehow involved in it, obviously because he said he originally had purchased it.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.496
I'm going to put a little piece of paper for that article.

28:28.499 --> 28:32.323
They got papers of reading colonial... Just put that close name on.

28:33.097 --> 28:35.980
They got papers after 1920.

28:36.481 --> 28:49.616
Because he had a professional staff, they were able to search out and find archives, papers, and lesser-valued libraries, more historically-oriented libraries.

28:51.318 --> 28:54.262
But all the same, he was buying big Civil War libraries.

28:55.303 --> 28:59.408
He was buying so many things in Brock to really create a research lab.

28:59.658 --> 29:07.627
It comes out in the paper here that I point out that most of the great early colonial papers that we got with the Huntington came after 1920 when he had a staff in place.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.691
Was that in addition to the 1570s?

29:12.132 --> 29:12.412
Yeah.

29:12.432 --> 29:16.697
He started collecting when he was 50.

29:16.717 --> 29:17.938
It's vague, you know.

29:18.058 --> 29:24.305
Actually, I said in the Times piece, he didn't become a serious collector until 55, and I gave myself an out on that.

29:24.606 --> 29:24.906
Yeah.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.485
I mean, right, right.

29:27.766 --> 29:36.229
The serious is after the poor, the poor live collection sale was in 1908, and 1910 was the, was the hole in that church.

29:36.249 --> 29:36.430
Yeah.

29:36.450 --> 29:36.730
Yeah.

29:36.751 --> 29:41.764
You just leave it tight if you want something.
