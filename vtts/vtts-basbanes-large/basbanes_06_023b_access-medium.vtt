00:02.512 --> 00:15.426
In the room of the Scenic Road Press, that's a gorgeous letter.

00:15.766 --> 00:22.233
The same size as the one that Morris had that's now at the Huntington Library.

00:22.333 --> 00:30.662
See, he had one fat size and he had three that are higher than your shoulder, as in that picture.

00:30.895 --> 00:42.388
Right next to this press, we have a computer, quite a modern computer, an IBM, and I gather you have a software catalog.

00:43.149 --> 00:43.990
Notebook 2.

00:44.150 --> 00:44.991
Notebook 2.

00:45.892 --> 00:46.253
Okay.

00:46.493 --> 00:54.922
Which was recommended by the Rare Book Library in Stanford as being the most advanced cataloging program.

00:55.263 --> 00:59.788
And you have just entered the 2,102.

00:59.954 --> 01:04.901
102 Morris item in your catalog.

01:05.081 --> 01:05.362
Yeah.

01:05.382 --> 01:07.204
And you feel you have a thousand more to go.

01:07.324 --> 01:08.145
Just a thousand.

01:08.165 --> 01:10.248
A thousand more of your items to catalog?

01:10.669 --> 01:10.849
Yes.

01:10.869 --> 01:12.892
Okay.

01:12.912 --> 01:16.397
Now, this is essentially the printing library.

01:17.098 --> 01:27.933
So you were talking about some of these things about collecting down there and up here.

01:27.993 --> 01:28.594
Mostly books.

01:28.844 --> 01:35.290
Oh, here, let me show you.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.012
The Morgan Library.

01:38.192 --> 01:38.353
Oh.

01:38.513 --> 01:41.075
I've got to write this down.

01:41.175 --> 01:42.296
I can get that from the Morgan.

01:42.696 --> 01:45.059
I wanted to get the case.

01:45.079 --> 01:45.599
1976.

01:45.619 --> 01:48.121
Yeah, they have these, by the way.

01:48.141 --> 01:52.225
1976, William Morris and the Art of the Book.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.168
Beautiful.

01:55.188 --> 01:56.028
And you had a number of?

01:56.489 --> 01:56.809
Yeah.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.850
Well, there we really felt we were in good company.

02:01.111 --> 02:03.373
Look at this.

02:03.393 --> 02:03.814
Lenders.

02:05.035 --> 02:05.556
Look at the lenders.

02:05.876 --> 02:17.349
Birmingham City Museums, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, Cambridge University Press, the Doheny Memorial Library, the Fitzway Museum, the Gloria Club, Metropolitan Museum of Art, St.

02:17.409 --> 02:24.476
Bride Printing Library, Society of Antiquaries, the Victorian Album Museum, Sanford Albury, I don't know, Breslauer.

02:24.617 --> 02:25.918
He's a dealer.

02:26.607 --> 02:28.429
And Paul Mellon is in there.

02:28.589 --> 02:29.950
Gordon Ray is very important.

02:29.970 --> 02:32.652
John A. Sacks, he had a store on Fifth Avenue.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.176
They were sitting next to each other at lunch one day.

02:36.196 --> 02:36.516
Oh, my God.

02:36.536 --> 02:38.137
At the opening of this exhibit.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.919
And he asked Cynthia what he did.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.300
And he said, I'm an architect.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.982
And his name is John A. Sacks.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.223
He said, what are you doing?

02:44.443 --> 02:45.844
He said, I'm in that.

02:45.864 --> 02:46.385
What do you think?

02:46.405 --> 02:47.166
I have some stores.

02:47.186 --> 02:49.488
I have some stores.

02:49.508 --> 02:50.609
That's what he said.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.210
And here's Norman H. Starks.

02:52.230 --> 02:53.832
Norman H. Starks.

02:53.852 --> 02:54.252
Norman H. Starks.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.283
That looks like a very important book for me to get.

02:57.403 --> 02:58.004
Yeah.

02:58.024 --> 02:59.085
And they're all in print.

02:59.105 --> 03:00.027
I know that.

03:00.047 --> 03:04.833
This tells you more about Morris.

03:05.254 --> 03:15.188
See, now here's one of the examples where he worked with the commercial printer to try to improve their typography.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.750
He was kind of miffed though, right?

03:16.770 --> 03:17.511
Oh, he was.

03:18.913 --> 03:22.217
I won't say the other word.

03:22.237 --> 03:23.479
But he did design.

03:23.763 --> 03:30.912
But this is a great thing.

03:31.052 --> 03:35.117
Here's his hand illumination.

03:35.137 --> 03:40.223
This is the Aeneid that Andrew Lloyd Webber just bought.

03:40.423 --> 03:41.024
I'll show you.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.408
Andrew Lloyd Webber is the Phantom of the Opera guy.

03:44.708 --> 03:47.011
And the Les Miserables.

03:47.031 --> 03:47.532
Les Miserables.

03:47.692 --> 03:49.734
He's a major Morris collector.

03:49.835 --> 03:51.897
Which nobody realized until he bought

03:52.298 --> 03:55.082
$2 million worth from the Doheny Morris.

03:55.543 --> 03:57.125
Were you representative of that sale?

03:57.145 --> 03:59.468
Yeah, I got it.

03:59.488 --> 04:01.351
Oh, you did, yeah.

04:01.551 --> 04:09.903
Oh, here, I was going to show you the, at the night of the opening of this exhibit.

04:10.344 --> 04:10.484
Oh.

04:10.644 --> 04:11.926
I think I read some of these.

04:11.946 --> 04:14.009
Here's John M. Crawford.

04:14.029 --> 04:16.994
For Sandy Berger, so glad we met last.

04:17.014 --> 04:19.437
It's really John M. Crawford, Jr.

04:19.754 --> 04:29.403
He is the fellow that... Major Morris collector who traded with Norman Strauss for the Cobden Sanderson.

04:29.423 --> 04:30.824
It's a great collector's story.

04:31.945 --> 04:34.707
And this is Charles Ryskamp, who was the head of the Morgan.

04:34.767 --> 04:35.508
The head of the Morgan.

04:35.588 --> 04:40.172
I think he left to go to the first.

04:40.192 --> 04:47.779
Sandy Berger, a collector of discrimination, distinction, and a friend of Morris and of all who loved the book.

04:47.899 --> 04:48.900
Charles Ryskamp.

04:49.589 --> 04:56.380
But best wishes to Sandy Berger, one of our most generous lenders, Paul Needham, who just went over to Selfies, by the way.

04:56.400 --> 04:56.520
Right.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.401
Yes, he did.

04:57.421 --> 05:00.406
John Dreyfus, he wrote one of the essays.

05:00.426 --> 05:03.070
He's the typographic.

05:03.971 --> 05:12.645
Well, he was the assistant printer at the Cambridge University Press while Brooke Crooksley was there, and then he was a consultant to the Monotype Coal.

05:12.865 --> 05:13.186
But anyway.

05:15.009 --> 05:16.351
Joe, what's it for?

05:16.371 --> 05:17.773
Sandy, who scooped

05:18.344 --> 05:23.069
The type designs of William and who shared... W.M.

05:23.589 --> 05:35.822
William Morris, I'm sorry, W.M., and who shares everything underlined with such abundant enthusiasm and generosity.

05:36.082 --> 05:41.208
John Dreyfus.

05:41.228 --> 05:46.393
And then Joe Dunlap is the great scholar and collector in New York.

05:47.048 --> 05:52.255
in the Library of Columbia is retired.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.497
To Sandy, to whom?

05:54.438 --> 05:55.059
Mauricians.

05:55.299 --> 06:01.688
Mauricians, M-O-R-R-I-S-I-A-N-S, will be ever indebted cordially jail time.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.712
This is the pantheon, I suppose.

06:04.733 --> 06:08.297
Tomorrow's involvement.

06:08.317 --> 06:09.719
That was a thrill.

06:09.739 --> 06:13.665
Yeah.

06:14.446 --> 06:15.908
John Dreyfus wrote that.

06:16.158 --> 06:32.953
Oh, this is it.

06:35.535 --> 06:44.443
This fellow, John Walsdorf, he's the

06:45.352 --> 06:50.058
North American representative for Blackwell, a bookseller from Oxford.

06:51.019 --> 07:01.492
He got into collecting Morris, and he ended up publishing William Morris in private press and limited edition.

07:03.434 --> 07:05.877
Oh, this is a great page here.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.580
It's got the Tunnel Road Press.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.381
Oh, you're in there.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.907
He's got the Scenic Road Press.

07:14.360 --> 07:20.349
several examples where I did the typographic layout for a printer in San Francisco.

07:20.369 --> 07:25.517
He's got that.

07:25.557 --> 07:29.403
You have become a printer within the last 20 or so years then.

07:29.463 --> 07:32.107
Here's piece number one.

07:32.307 --> 07:34.130
Christmas of 1970 or New Year's.

07:34.410 --> 07:42.342
I guess because if you became, if you got involved in Morris in 60, 65, it couldn't have been prior to that.

07:44.414 --> 07:46.877
That was the first item produced at the time of year.

07:46.897 --> 07:55.007
Yeah, this is the first item produced at the Tunnelo Press, Berkeley, California, set in 36-point and 18-point number one, Baskerville.

07:55.488 --> 08:06.761
Types and printed with an Albion hand press, which is this over here, on Blake Moffitt, M-O-F-F-E-T-T, and Town, T-O-W-M-E, or Tender Coverstock.

08:07.763 --> 08:11.908
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Stephen, Jeff, Helen, and Sanford.

08:11.928 --> 08:13.169
Oh, that was a Christmas greeting.

08:13.690 --> 08:13.830
It was.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.572
See, it's folded.

08:16.152 --> 08:19.997
I cut it in half just to cut it down.

08:20.017 --> 08:23.421
Those are the names of the boys, Kip, Stephen, that's the E-B-E-N, and Jeff.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.482
Kip is short for letters.

08:24.502 --> 08:25.143
Kip is Kip.

08:25.163 --> 08:25.664
Kip is Kip.

08:25.684 --> 08:29.448
That's his name.

08:30.409 --> 08:34.974
Morris is chief designer and sort of right-hand man.

08:35.335 --> 08:39.700
He took him in when he was about 16 or 17 and taught him everything.

08:40.405 --> 08:47.515
And he actually succeeded Morris when Morris died, and he continued as the design manager of the company.

08:48.356 --> 08:57.809
But I have, and his name is J. H. John Henry Durell, D-E-A-R-L-E, Durell.

08:57.829 --> 09:04.658
I have several of his sketchbooks, and one has this portrait of Morris that Durell did.

09:06.865 --> 09:10.010
You want to read a naughty thing?

09:10.030 --> 09:12.213
Read this one.

09:13.295 --> 09:19.084
The over 700 watercolor drawings of those very same windows.

09:21.468 --> 09:27.237
Project them simultaneously and see the comparison between...

09:27.537 --> 09:32.503
I'm just going to tape off the first half, but as a group you've been doing this?

09:32.563 --> 09:33.884
No, no, just Helen and me.

09:33.984 --> 09:35.766
Just Helen and you're going through?

09:35.786 --> 09:36.887
185 churches.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.289
And where are they all located?

09:38.309 --> 09:38.649
All over England.

09:38.669 --> 09:39.490
All over England.

09:39.971 --> 09:44.236
See, like this next year, we're going on the end of September and October.

09:45.437 --> 09:51.223
We'll be starting out from London and going east, south, a little south.

09:51.904 --> 09:56.329
There's a whole bunch over there and over to the Isle of Wight.

09:57.355 --> 09:59.138
And the goal is to document.

09:59.679 --> 10:06.189
Document all the windows that have survived, because there's a lot of redundancy.

10:06.329 --> 10:10.996
That's what they declare the church when there aren't enough people who go in the church to keep it up.

10:11.016 --> 10:12.198
They close it.

10:13.339 --> 10:23.515
And only recently have they organized a system of either protecting or getting the windows out of there before the kids get out and bust it.

10:24.001 --> 10:25.704
Here is the collector, by the way.

10:25.724 --> 10:26.465
It's preserving.

10:26.565 --> 10:32.053
By the way, this is— Yeah, it's going to be a— But I mean, this is where the collector comes in and saves things.

10:32.073 --> 10:36.079
Here's the Berne Jones cartoon from St.

10:36.179 --> 10:37.081
Francis.

10:37.101 --> 10:38.643
Explain to my wife what a cartoon is.

10:38.663 --> 10:48.778
I think you'd probably— It's a full-size drawing from which a window or a tapestry or anything—this you could call a cartoon.

10:48.918 --> 10:53.485
I call them color separations for the woodblock cutter.

10:53.836 --> 10:55.898
for the printed fabric.

10:55.918 --> 11:09.272
Each different color needs a separate block, full-size, careful, because that's what the craftsman is going to execute from, is whatever you put on that cartoon.

11:09.292 --> 11:11.855
And it's full-size, too, which is very important.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.297
It's always full-size.

11:14.417 --> 11:19.182
Morris and Company would reuse designs.

11:20.384 --> 11:22.746
They had a very organized system of

11:23.671 --> 11:28.538
photographic files, which we have five of.

11:28.558 --> 11:31.803
I'll show them to you.

11:31.883 --> 11:37.451
These are all rolled-up, full-size cartoons of windows.

11:38.612 --> 11:43.680
These three come on a window that's 25 feet tall.

11:45.482 --> 11:46.484
They're most incredible.

11:46.964 --> 11:52.412
And the only time we've ever seen them on the road was one in the museum in Monterey.

11:53.033 --> 12:01.085
had an exhibit, and they got the fire department from across the street to bring in their twenty-four.

12:01.105 --> 12:06.032
And the firemen climbed up the ladder and mounted these from near the roof.

12:06.052 --> 12:08.175
Cartoons are spelled the same way.

12:08.235 --> 12:09.096
Like a cartoon.

12:09.116 --> 12:10.178
Like a cartoon, yeah.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.704
Yeah, it was just a spectacular thing.

12:15.846 --> 12:21.454
Now, here's one of the most important documents that was in the archives.

12:22.700 --> 12:27.446
These are the Morris Company archives, which you acquired.

12:29.008 --> 12:31.952
On block, by the way?

12:32.472 --> 12:38.940
Let's say the last block, and I can explain how it happened to be still intact.

12:38.960 --> 12:45.268
These are the formulas for the dyes for the printed fabrics with swatches.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.252
Each page has a swatch.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.072
Documents.

12:56.172 --> 12:59.757
Incredible.

12:59.777 --> 13:00.277
Oh, let's see.

13:00.297 --> 13:01.819
I just want to touch it.

13:01.839 --> 13:02.180
May I?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.481
Oh, sure.

13:03.882 --> 13:05.464
First, I want to show you.

13:05.624 --> 13:14.816
See, that's this design there called Strawberry Thief on Mat Claw.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.181
That's page 49.

13:19.402 --> 13:19.562
Yeah.

13:20.703 --> 13:20.984
Feel this one.

13:21.004 --> 13:21.985
That's it.

13:23.062 --> 13:26.285
These are marvelous.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.527
If you want to touch some of them, please do.

13:28.547 --> 13:29.308
Oh, God.

13:29.348 --> 13:33.852
There's another beautiful one that I've never seen.

13:33.872 --> 13:40.018
Now, are these maintained by a number of different people, or is this basically one individual journal, do you think, or is this the company's journal?

13:40.038 --> 13:41.639
This is the company's journal.

13:41.679 --> 13:44.642
So any number of different people would contribute items to this.

13:44.842 --> 13:51.448
See, when they would want to make another batch and get it the same as the previous batch,

13:51.513 --> 13:54.676
And if they found there was a problem, they would cross it out.

13:54.696 --> 13:56.838
So this has very technical information.

13:56.858 --> 13:57.779
Oh, okay.

13:57.799 --> 13:59.361
This is the chemical for me.

13:59.381 --> 14:03.264
Can you describe the information contained to the right of each swatch?

14:03.304 --> 14:04.846
What basically is that?

14:04.866 --> 14:06.307
That tells you how to produce?

14:06.568 --> 14:20.541
How to the sequence of the materials and chemicals in order to reproduce a subsequent batch.

14:20.825 --> 14:23.509
So using this, some designer could replicate.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.070
Okay.

14:24.090 --> 14:38.430
Now, there's a woman from New York, Virginia Davis, who has, let's see, been here on two separate occasions and done a great deal of research and actually executed.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.275
She is, by, let's say, profession, a dyer.

14:42.315 --> 14:47.743
And she has published in a magazine about dying,

14:47.977 --> 14:59.824
And in the article, she cautions amateurs, be aware these are very serious, dangerous chemicals, so don't approach it lightly.

15:00.105 --> 15:02.169
There are acids and all kinds of things.

15:02.190 --> 15:05.738
Yeah, but this is almost the Rosetta Stone to making a Morris fabric.

15:05.758 --> 15:05.918
Exactly.

15:06.826 --> 15:08.027
This tells you how to do it.

15:08.047 --> 15:09.549
This tells you what it takes.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.633
It doesn't give you the technique and the experience of how to handle it.

15:13.653 --> 15:14.934
It gives you the table.

15:15.275 --> 15:15.975
That's right.

15:15.995 --> 15:17.897
It gives you the menu, I guess.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.838
The recipe.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.719
The recipe.

15:19.779 --> 15:20.500
There's the word.

15:21.061 --> 15:22.522
This is the recipe.

15:22.642 --> 15:25.665
But it doesn't make you a chef.

15:25.685 --> 15:26.226
You got it.

15:27.007 --> 15:29.049
There you go.

15:29.069 --> 15:36.276
But these things they found were the wrong amounts, so they altered them.

15:36.948 --> 15:41.635
So this is the working shop book.

15:43.477 --> 15:44.779
What do they call it?

15:44.799 --> 15:49.946
The Merton Abbey Dye book.

15:50.467 --> 15:56.736
M-E-R-T-O-N Abbey Dye book.

15:57.798 --> 15:59.400
And everybody knows it.

15:59.420 --> 16:04.407
It keeps getting, I allow it to be published, you know, pages from it.

16:04.808 --> 16:06.049
Who owns the copyright on it?

16:06.250 --> 16:07.731
Or is the copyright lapsed?

16:09.053 --> 16:09.654
I think I do.

16:10.314 --> 16:16.882
And if anybody wants to publish extracts for that, they need your permission?

16:16.902 --> 16:19.205
Your permission.

16:19.225 --> 16:19.706
Do you give it?

16:19.946 --> 16:22.569
Yeah.

16:22.969 --> 16:25.953
This box.

16:25.973 --> 16:32.060
Early proofs of initials and ornaments from the original wood box, Kelskart Press.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.702
Good.

16:34.087 --> 16:49.228
Three sets of these pulled, three sets of these proofs made when the press closed, and just before they gave all the woodblocks to the British Museum Library, they made these three sets.

16:49.488 --> 16:53.434
One is at the British Museum, one's at the Morgan Library, and one's there.

16:53.454 --> 16:57.259
Look at that old label from Morris Company.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.980
What some people would do just to get on with one of those labels.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.461
Oh, yeah.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.703
Never mind this stuff.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.066
Yeah.

17:05.126 --> 17:12.278
That's a very desirable ephemera in its own way, isn't it?

17:12.318 --> 17:12.879
This one?

17:12.899 --> 17:13.200
Yeah.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.562
This is a long.

17:15.043 --> 17:18.228
See, these are original pieces in three different colors.

17:18.368 --> 17:19.931
Well, they have retained.

17:20.552 --> 17:21.053
Just brilliant.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.670
They haven't lost a thing.

17:23.690 --> 17:29.378
They haven't faded at all.

17:30.239 --> 17:31.902
But they haven't faded even slightly.

17:32.102 --> 17:34.706
How old did you say that fabric is?

17:34.826 --> 17:37.209
Probably 1874.

17:37.229 --> 17:37.950
116 years.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.474
Wow.

17:41.535 --> 17:46.683
Now these are watercolor designs done by Durrell, remember J.H.

17:46.703 --> 17:49.707
Durrell, in 1924.

17:51.222 --> 17:58.753
for the church at Cranbrook near Detroit.

17:58.773 --> 18:03.860
See, this is the Old Testament and the New Testament.

18:03.880 --> 18:13.995
Cranbrook is a school started by a guy, his last name was Booth.

18:14.015 --> 18:19.643
He brought Eliel Saarinen over from Sweden.

18:21.007 --> 18:26.533
to start the school as a school as well as design the building.

18:26.553 --> 18:28.094
He was an architect.

18:28.114 --> 18:39.025
And then you may know Eliel's son, Eero Saarinen, who designed the TWA Terminal in New York and the Dulles in Washington, D.C.

18:39.045 --> 18:42.469
But this was designed for tapestries.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.031
They're twenty-one foot nine tall.

18:45.852 --> 18:50.457
Twenty-one foot nine tall.

18:50.960 --> 19:03.338
At the school, before Saarinen came, Booth had hired Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, the architect, to do the Gothic building.

19:04.100 --> 19:12.292
Incidentally, Goodhue was also a very good typographer, and his early work was pure Morris.

19:12.452 --> 19:16.478
Come here, let me show you a Goodhue .

19:26.617 --> 19:29.460
I've got some catalogs from my good friends, Ann and David Bromer.

19:30.101 --> 19:31.322
Yes, we know them.

19:31.462 --> 19:31.983
Very well.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.666
Yeah, they've been here.

19:35.586 --> 19:35.787
Have they?

19:43.615 --> 19:43.855
Yeah.

19:43.875 --> 19:44.396
Here we go.

19:44.456 --> 19:50.222
Yeah, as a matter of fact, that box I just showed you of the proofs from the woodblock I got from the Bromer.

19:50.242 --> 19:50.502
Really?

19:55.327 --> 19:55.948
Look at that.

19:56.317 --> 19:57.858
That's a booming, a boomer.

19:58.939 --> 20:00.140
And what do we call this stuff?

20:00.461 --> 20:01.382
Well, this is a border.

20:01.882 --> 20:02.803
Okay.

20:02.823 --> 20:08.868
But you can see Goofy, who was very much influenced the proportion of the... Very amazing.

20:08.888 --> 20:10.430
It's very... You'd think of it.

20:10.550 --> 20:11.231
It really was.

20:11.251 --> 20:19.518
See, there's a woman called Susan Thompson, American Book Design and William Morris.

20:19.758 --> 20:26.104
And she, this is her thesis, her PhD, on the same subject, of

20:26.303 --> 20:29.307
the influence on Morris on all the American print of a book.

20:29.327 --> 20:34.333
I mean, derivative is too mild a word.

20:34.353 --> 20:35.174
Oh, no.

20:35.194 --> 20:45.566
So she has analyzed or gathered together all the people who have strongly influenced.

20:45.586 --> 20:47.008
I'm going to take a picture.

20:47.088 --> 20:50.452
This is a child Morris chair.

20:51.594 --> 20:53.796
I think it's child Morris chair.

20:53.896 --> 20:54.437
With Brother Rabbit.

20:54.788 --> 21:05.703
That was her little chair.

21:05.824 --> 21:08.688
I love it.

21:09.148 --> 21:23.749
I've never seen anything like that.

21:24.488 --> 21:32.579
I keep this here.

21:35.523 --> 21:36.405
It keeps my light on.

21:36.425 --> 21:36.585
Oh, boy.

21:36.605 --> 21:48.742
I just want to... Oh, look at it.

21:48.762 --> 21:48.942
Oh, yeah.

21:48.962 --> 21:49.303
Put that into it.

21:49.323 --> 21:50.264
Yeah, I think it's hard, but I think it's okay.

21:50.284 --> 21:51.245
That's almost worth a couple of shots, isn't it?

21:51.265 --> 21:52.487
Would you like to sit in one of those chairs?

21:54.830 --> 22:02.957
It's gently right here.

22:03.497 --> 22:10.083
Oh, this is so, I mean, yeah, it's breathtaking.

22:15.908 --> 22:18.290
That's the picture.

22:18.951 --> 22:21.253
Did you just see them all sometime?

22:21.273 --> 22:22.334
Let me tell you the story.

22:22.414 --> 22:23.875
Let's get this.

22:24.108 --> 22:25.269
What do you think I was shooting?

22:25.309 --> 22:26.811
I mean, I got that in there.

22:27.071 --> 22:33.839
That museum in Monterey actually has done three separate exhibits over the years.

22:33.859 --> 22:42.769
The first one was the stained glass, the second one was the textiles, and the third one was the typography.

22:42.789 --> 22:44.872
So, for here, I'll just jump over.

22:44.952 --> 22:46.613
For here, we can look.

22:46.634 --> 22:50.137
They did some nice publicity for invitation.

22:50.538 --> 22:51.499
I gave a talk.

22:51.682 --> 22:56.588
That was in 1979.

22:58.350 --> 23:14.128
And they built—see, they couldn't afford to build the whole frame, so they built a backlighted box and stood the ten figures up, so they were still a great spectacle.

23:14.148 --> 23:17.912
But these are some of those rolls you saw in the closet unrolled.

23:18.413 --> 23:19.714
She's always watching the show.

23:20.318 --> 23:23.482
The 25-foot ones keep going up to the gable.

23:24.944 --> 23:26.607
Here, you can see it.

23:26.627 --> 23:28.109
Excuse me.

23:28.129 --> 23:30.071
Yeah, see, this has a gable roof.

23:30.772 --> 23:33.316
And that drawing went right up to the peak.

23:34.477 --> 23:38.883
It was really... I had never seen it.

23:39.084 --> 23:43.330
But these are some marvelous drawings.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.853
I hate to keep them rolled up because you can't look at them.

23:47.487 --> 23:49.429
So this is, in other words, a neat room.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.973
This is the Morris room, right?

23:52.473 --> 23:55.317
What a wonderful exhibition.

23:55.497 --> 23:57.980
Then here's of those 140 drawings.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.323
Here you can see them.

24:00.343 --> 24:03.827
Not all of them, but a lot of them.

24:04.308 --> 24:09.034
And with the watercolor drawings, which I'll show you some of them.

24:09.054 --> 24:11.737
They're jewel-like drawings.

24:11.757 --> 24:16.363
Then for the textiles, I proposed

24:16.833 --> 24:27.631
but they built a replica of his Oxford Street showroom.

24:27.651 --> 24:28.352
That's a good idea.

24:28.373 --> 24:29.294
Here it is.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.777
See, there it is on Oxford Street.

24:30.797 --> 24:34.222
So they took this photograph, duplicated it.

24:34.864 --> 24:39.672
We picked out things to furnish it with the two jugs and the desk.

24:39.692 --> 24:40.834
Oh, isn't that nice.

24:41.114 --> 24:42.857
And you entered the exhibit.

24:43.158 --> 24:43.959
through the door.

24:44.039 --> 24:45.381
See, you came in through here.

24:45.662 --> 24:46.203
See the floor?

24:46.223 --> 24:47.104
What a wonderful idea.

24:47.344 --> 24:51.932
And then you were in the exhibit.

24:54.696 --> 24:56.759
Oh, this stuff was just magnificent.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.044
Now, this was right down, this is here in Monterey.

25:00.765 --> 25:10.380
I'm sure that what occasion this is is the happy coincidence that you're a neighbor.

25:12.672 --> 25:17.218
And then the third exhibit was the—oh, this is all the wallpapers.

25:18.439 --> 25:25.949
Would you say this is the most extensive show that has been mounted at your holdings, principally your holdings?

25:27.871 --> 25:29.033
Let's put it this way.

25:29.053 --> 25:40.367
See, these are three separate shows, each one of which went into greater depth than either the Stanford exhibit that tried to include everything,

25:40.499 --> 25:44.525
or the UC Berkeley exhibit that included everything.

25:44.545 --> 25:52.196
So, more material in the total of these three shows than either one of those.

25:52.216 --> 25:52.917
That's awfully nice.

25:52.937 --> 25:55.140
Now, here's the typography.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.442
These were the two curators.

25:57.243 --> 26:00.368
Monterey Peninsula Museum of Life.

26:01.089 --> 26:02.270
And that was in 85?

26:02.731 --> 26:03.372
Yeah.

26:03.392 --> 26:05.395
September, October, and November 85.

26:07.218 --> 26:08.920
See, we took the press over there.

26:09.524 --> 26:10.885
Oh, those poor guys here.

26:11.005 --> 26:13.148
Look at them trying to get it back in the van.

26:16.010 --> 26:27.762
But along with everything to do with typography, we had a single piece of the window, a single woven fabric, printed fabric, just one example of it.

26:27.782 --> 26:35.890
There's the carpet that you saw at the top of the stairs.

26:36.690 --> 26:39.413
Yeah, it was magnificent.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.103
That's our Chaucer, isn't it, no?

26:42.123 --> 26:43.905
No, that's one of the other books.

26:44.285 --> 26:49.532
The Chaucer was all in this case here.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.516
How did you feel about having all of your things out of the house like that?

26:52.816 --> 26:53.938
Do you feel like a parent?

26:54.058 --> 26:54.498
It was empty.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.841
You're seeing your kid go out and test date?

26:56.861 --> 26:59.104
I mean, can't wait till they come home.

26:59.124 --> 27:04.811
We kept going over there to look at them, see if they were tucked in.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.373
But it was a great show.

27:06.393 --> 27:09.197
They really just did everything they could possibly.

27:09.515 --> 27:12.899
They had all of these cases built for this exhibit.

27:14.682 --> 27:15.343
They were well protected.

27:15.423 --> 27:21.350
Oh, in that box, those proofs of the woodblock, here they are all the way around the room.

27:21.731 --> 27:25.416
We used it like a freeze.

27:25.436 --> 27:28.440
That was impressive.

27:28.460 --> 27:29.100
Good turnout?

27:29.661 --> 27:31.544
Oh, like that never had before.

27:31.964 --> 27:34.207
I bet they came from all over for us.

27:34.227 --> 27:34.588
They did.

27:36.270 --> 27:38.813
Yeah, that's how I'm saying.

27:39.147 --> 27:44.016
I was looking at the marks.

27:45.659 --> 27:57.501
That's ceramics.

27:58.643 --> 28:01.408
Read the middle line first.

28:02.924 --> 28:13.299
to the fortune of the maid who was called cinder maid and was afterwards a queen.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.562
I don't know what it is already.

28:15.582 --> 28:28.240
How her sisters would go to the prince's feast without her, but her godmother gave her the shoes of glass wherewith she went to the prince's feast and danced with him.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.665
How she lost her shoe of glass at the feast and how the prince

28:32.303 --> 29:00.876
made to be cried that he would wit her that he could wear the shoe and how cinder made alone could wear it the whole story morris told it in three months is that the genesis of the story no i don't know i wonder why cinder made though how did we find cinder made that is his which can you tell me a little bit about these about these she took the cinders out what can you tell me the burn jones design

29:02.020 --> 29:10.232
And this was done in the first year of the company, because all they needed was a kiln for a six-inch square tile.

29:11.734 --> 29:14.037
So it was before they really got organized.

29:14.097 --> 29:15.079
Where did this repose?

29:15.519 --> 29:16.701
Where was this?

29:17.342 --> 29:18.043
I'm not sure.

29:18.063 --> 29:27.657
The only copy that's mounted like this is one other set.

29:31.383 --> 29:33.005
What would you call it?

29:33.105 --> 29:33.785
I mean, I'm just curious.

29:33.845 --> 29:35.126
What was it made for?

29:35.187 --> 29:37.509
It was made to go over a fireplace.

29:37.589 --> 29:38.209
A fireplace.

29:38.530 --> 29:39.070
Probably.

29:42.393 --> 29:46.397
Do you have a picture of it?

29:46.417 --> 29:48.959
He wrote to me that he had this.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.543
Did they try to give you a provenance when they have one?

29:52.943 --> 29:53.584
If they have one.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.587
But he didn't know, because I have one.

29:57.607 --> 29:58.388
He didn't know the word.

29:58.408 --> 30:00.310
Who is it that tries to ascertain

30:00.593 --> 30:03.096
Authenticity, you or the dealer for both?

30:03.116 --> 30:03.938
Oh, both.

30:03.958 --> 30:07.803
All the good dealers always try to.

30:07.823 --> 30:16.575
Partly they're interested, but partly they know who we sang earlier.

30:17.877 --> 30:20.440
Have you ever unwittingly gotten any forgeries?

30:22.062 --> 30:28.752
No.

30:28.772 --> 30:29.773
You'd know them, of course.

30:31.492 --> 30:35.575
That's your calligraphy.

30:36.396 --> 30:39.559
This is the first card catalog I've ever seen in beautiful calligraphy.

30:44.223 --> 30:46.745
That's okay.

30:46.765 --> 30:48.907
It's his card catalog of his possessions.

30:49.107 --> 30:50.688
No, but I think it's funny.

30:51.909 --> 30:56.693
The way I practiced, first of all, being an architect, I was pretty good at lettering.

30:57.854 --> 31:01.397
But it also happened when I got started doing it.

31:02.677 --> 31:21.223
that I was on the Berkeley Planning Commission, and I would sit up there, you know, in the council chambers, behind the big desk there, and most people, I think, thought I was taking copious notes on the proceedings.

31:25.449 --> 31:31.738
Actually, I was sitting there,

31:32.208 --> 31:33.249
That's your calligraphy?

31:33.409 --> 31:33.810
Yeah.

31:33.830 --> 31:35.031
That's extraordinary.

31:35.071 --> 31:35.612
That's beautiful.

31:36.392 --> 31:38.395
I always practice.

31:38.415 --> 31:45.042
While the meetings are going on, while you should be paying attention to... I was paying attention.

31:45.722 --> 31:50.868
The implication that I wasn't paying attention.

31:50.888 --> 31:51.128
I'm teasing.

31:51.148 --> 31:52.810
How dare you.

31:52.850 --> 31:54.572
During the meeting.

31:54.612 --> 31:58.396
That's what others might call doodling, but you made it very productive.

31:58.416 --> 31:58.536
Right.

32:00.457 --> 32:04.142
Book collector, antique collection.

32:04.162 --> 32:05.223
He's trying out words.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.589
Combination of letters together.

32:09.609 --> 32:10.771
All the important people.

32:12.693 --> 32:17.180
Sidney Cockrell's secretary.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.083
Oh, this is magnificent.

32:20.103 --> 32:24.770
How do you get such thick characters?

32:24.790 --> 32:26.092
Just a thicker pen.

32:26.112 --> 32:26.672
Is that right?

32:26.692 --> 32:29.056
Yeah, the various thicknesses of pen pie.

32:29.076 --> 32:30.177
That's quite a fine.

32:31.085 --> 32:36.229
spiky kind of way.

32:36.249 --> 33:00.670
I have the correspondence between Quaritch and Ellis, who is Morris' associate and editor on several of the books, when they were negotiating for Quaritch to be the publisher of the first Countess Press book, in which it stated

33:01.004 --> 33:09.554
that Morris will have sole selection of the type, the paper, the this, the that, and the printer.

33:10.195 --> 33:19.025
Because originally, Morris intended to do typographic layout, but then have a commercial printer actually execute it.

33:19.045 --> 33:26.914
And at some point, he decided, if you're going to have control, you've got to have presses, hire the compositors and the press and the whole thing.

33:27.835 --> 33:30.758
So if you want total control of what you're doing,

33:32.392 --> 33:34.435
That is the ultimate.

33:34.455 --> 33:38.920
Now study that carefully.

33:39.101 --> 33:40.543
All right.

33:40.563 --> 33:40.663
Okay.

33:41.203 --> 33:43.246
Directly from his own wool.

33:46.330 --> 33:48.473
Now there's nobody else you can blame.

33:49.915 --> 33:52.278
You've got to do total control.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.640
No middle.

33:53.980 --> 34:01.690
Now here's that idea.

34:01.805 --> 34:03.708
Total control in a phrase.

34:04.248 --> 34:04.669
That's it.

34:05.670 --> 34:10.277
And when he selected, he had the paper made to order.

34:10.857 --> 34:12.860
He had the ink made to order.

34:13.241 --> 34:15.584
He designed his own type.

34:16.886 --> 34:18.208
He examined everything.

34:18.228 --> 34:26.619
You should see the minute changes that I have on proof sheets to the final sheet, things you wouldn't believe.

34:26.859 --> 34:27.801
This looks like a block.

34:28.402 --> 34:31.626
It's a wood block for the pink and rose wallpaper.

34:31.741 --> 34:34.784
That's the actual block.

34:34.804 --> 34:37.687
That's the actual block they would print out.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.950
How large would it be to make the whole swath?

34:39.970 --> 34:44.995
I mean, that's just a... There was another section, and then it repeated from that.

34:45.015 --> 34:46.317
This was the width of the roll.

34:46.577 --> 34:48.760
Which is about 2 1⁄2, 3 feet, I would say.

34:48.780 --> 34:53.885
Not quite.

34:53.905 --> 34:56.648
More like 12 to there.

34:56.668 --> 34:57.649
Pretty close.

34:57.669 --> 34:58.410
Nine more.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.111
21 inches.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.212
21 inches.

35:00.817 --> 35:01.698
And how high about?

35:01.838 --> 35:12.471
And then high would be about more like, I think, 19, so that would be about 38-inch vertical repeat.

35:14.953 --> 35:26.106
That's where, see, in order to avoid seeing where block meets block, they would camouflage it by doing that.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.149
And the other one would fit in.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.170
It doesn't fit in.

35:29.572 --> 35:36.641
You print with this one, take it away, then bring the next block and register it right where this line was.

35:38.604 --> 35:43.490
Up there are, let's say, the boards from the various exhibits.

35:43.510 --> 35:50.679
There's a full-size drawing by Marth for one of these designs, the cartoon and other.

35:50.699 --> 35:58.870
And then he took a red pen line and delineated where the matching edges should be so that it's not

35:59.187 --> 36:00.848
It's not legible.

36:01.429 --> 36:05.973
While I was shooting the picture, you were just telling us what it was.

36:05.993 --> 36:07.474
Could you tell us what that is?

36:09.396 --> 36:11.118
Let me tell you this much.

36:11.138 --> 36:12.779
It was designed by Mark.

36:18.204 --> 36:28.553
You can have catalogs for each of the different crafts that they produce, and you could buy either the design to embroider it yourself,

36:29.275 --> 36:36.503
Which, incidentally, Fitzwilliam produces it.

36:36.524 --> 36:37.264
Exactly.

36:37.284 --> 36:39.747
You could buy a kit like that.

36:39.767 --> 36:45.154
Or you could have Morris and Company actually do it.

36:45.174 --> 36:45.975
That's the way to go.

36:46.996 --> 36:55.446
And then you could also... It's flowers, right?

36:55.486 --> 36:59.130
Then you could also order it in the frame already.

36:59.617 --> 37:04.745
See?

37:04.765 --> 37:05.907
And they've made the full place.

37:05.927 --> 37:07.490
Mark Moss was almost a visionary, wasn't he?

37:07.650 --> 37:11.716
I mean, he seems to have done things as no one else had conceived of doing.

37:13.119 --> 37:13.800
Yeah, nobody has done this before.

37:13.820 --> 37:18.447
Was he a modern man, in your view, or was he a 19th century man, I wonder?

37:18.467 --> 37:26.620
It's a curious thing how he would lecture and advocate that

37:26.988 --> 37:35.660
Before you try to do any craft, you must go back and learn everything about it that's been done.

37:37.723 --> 37:50.361
And then, having been discerning about what you've been learning or looking at, then sit down and do it your own way.

37:52.024 --> 37:55.729
But with that wealth of experience,

37:56.722 --> 37:59.546
of everything that's been done before.

37:59.566 --> 38:10.003
And then he would do that in a lot of his writing, where he would take a story and then retell it in his own way.

38:10.263 --> 38:18.637
Or when he did translation, he translated from Greek, from Latin, from French.

38:20.139 --> 38:24.045
He would, let's say, update some of the early, early English.

38:24.785 --> 38:37.797
He then wanted to do all the Norse sagas and the Icelandic sagas, so he hired a professor of Icelandic who was teaching in England, learned Icelandic.

38:38.698 --> 38:44.263
I can show you a manuscript where the teacher and Morris would work together.

38:46.605 --> 38:54.673
You knew nothing about this when you bought that first book in 1965.

38:55.868 --> 39:00.915
What I'm saying is that the passion seems to have... Item number one.

39:00.955 --> 39:02.417
That's it.

39:02.517 --> 39:03.879
That's the facsimile.

39:04.279 --> 39:05.301
That's the facsimile.

39:05.321 --> 39:10.007
Facsimile of the William R. Helmscott Chaucer.

39:10.027 --> 39:11.930
And you bought it, why did you have $10?

39:11.950 --> 39:12.330
$10.75.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.376
It was marked down.

39:16.957 --> 39:20.281
It was a used bookstore.

39:20.301 --> 39:23.125
And I opened it to these pages.

39:25.788 --> 39:51.913
I mean, you open that page there, and you've never seen anything like it, except, as I mentioned earlier, about my father being able to do things like that.

39:58.289 --> 40:07.139
My father loved to do this kind of leaf design overnight.

40:07.159 --> 40:08.120
And this is what you saw?

40:08.160 --> 40:10.122
So this was the first thing.

40:10.182 --> 40:13.886
Then I brought it home and read this introduction.

40:13.906 --> 40:17.651
By Jante Winterech, W-I-N-T-E-R-S-E-H.

40:17.671 --> 40:24.398
This was published in 1958.

40:25.002 --> 40:31.310
a facsimile of the white pigskin binding.

40:35.636 --> 40:50.074
So then, as I mentioned, I went over to Howells, and I'll show you the first book.

40:50.094 --> 40:50.535
There it is.

40:51.156 --> 40:53.659
That's pretty beautiful.

40:54.871 --> 41:00.879
Yeah, I'm going to have to, I'm afraid.

41:00.899 --> 41:01.941
This is the first one.

41:02.041 --> 41:05.246
Oh, God, that's wonderful.

41:05.266 --> 41:07.989
Pick it up and hold it.

41:08.009 --> 41:11.334
The Life and Death of Jason, J-A-S-O-N, by William Morris.

41:15.780 --> 41:20.247
So soft, isn't it?

41:20.267 --> 41:21.669
No, that's the vellum.

41:21.689 --> 41:22.009
It's the vellum.

41:23.592 --> 41:26.577
And it's also from the library of Edward Gwynn Jones.

41:26.857 --> 41:30.983
And that book plate was printed at the Kelmscott Press.

41:31.003 --> 41:34.589
The Grange North, End Road, Fulham, if you know H-A-N.

41:35.650 --> 41:39.897
Ex-Lewis Templeton and Crocker.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.059
Hang on to the book.

41:41.079 --> 41:42.401
Did he make his own paper?

41:42.421 --> 41:43.182
He had it made.

41:44.364 --> 41:49.792
He went to the papermaker's factory and actually made the first sheet.

41:50.593 --> 41:51.354
Oh, it's inscribed.

41:51.474 --> 41:51.895
Look at this.

41:52.263 --> 41:54.686
to Edward Byrne Jones from W.M.

41:54.766 --> 41:56.087
June 30, 1895.

41:56.227 --> 41:58.930
An inscribed copy.

42:00.812 --> 42:02.194
That's a pretty good inscription.

42:02.214 --> 42:04.837
We also call it a great association.

42:04.857 --> 42:05.497
That's a win.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.460
Look at that.

42:08.481 --> 42:09.402
Oh, God.

42:09.462 --> 42:10.643
I'm holding in my hands.

42:10.943 --> 42:12.485
This is the book.

42:12.525 --> 42:18.672
I'm holding in my hands the item that launched an obsession, I think.

42:21.795 --> 42:21.915
Right.

42:24.005 --> 42:26.868
Yeah.

42:26.888 --> 42:29.250
The condition is extraordinary.

42:29.270 --> 42:29.651
It does.

42:29.851 --> 42:31.473
It didn't flux at all, either, did it?

42:31.873 --> 42:32.574
No, no.

42:32.594 --> 42:33.675
Do any of his books flux?

42:33.695 --> 42:34.276
Yeah.

42:34.296 --> 42:35.176
Some do.

42:35.237 --> 42:36.658
Yeah.

42:40.742 --> 42:42.024
This is extraordinary.

42:42.044 --> 42:44.786
So it was kept, it was maintained with love.

42:44.806 --> 42:45.327
Oh, yeah.

42:45.387 --> 42:46.068
Never amused.

42:46.668 --> 42:53.235
So often you see beautiful things that... Doubled in progress, first of all,

42:53.789 --> 42:58.460
He was very discerning as a collection.

42:58.480 --> 43:03.050
And this was Templeton Crocker's collection that you ultimately acquired?

43:03.110 --> 43:03.351
Yes.

43:04.914 --> 43:11.088
And from that point— He collected in many, many fields, but this is the— The keystone?

43:11.569 --> 43:13.333
The Kelmstock part of it.

43:14.832 --> 43:19.337
Catalog of the Library of Charles Templeton Crocker.

43:19.658 --> 43:22.541
And you'll find in there the section on Kelmscock.

43:23.041 --> 43:24.263
I'm going to have to find this.

43:25.164 --> 43:27.707
Hillsborough, California, 1918.

43:27.807 --> 43:33.513
I'm sure he has.

43:36.497 --> 43:41.122
I have to write that down.

43:41.783 --> 43:44.586
This is the story of a glittering plane by William Morris.

43:45.038 --> 43:48.443
And this is the first book published by the Kelmscott Press.

43:48.984 --> 43:50.506
This also is from T.J.

43:50.526 --> 43:57.357
Cobden, C-O-B-D-E-N hyphen Sanderson, this is the E-R-S-O-N, also from the Library of Templeton-Crocker.

43:57.377 --> 43:59.280
And you recognize this name?

43:59.300 --> 44:00.562
That's the Doves Press.

44:01.383 --> 44:04.948
And this is a book plate printed at the Doves Press.

44:04.968 --> 44:05.109
Wow.

44:06.370 --> 44:12.620
And Templeton-Crocker had twelve Cobden-Sanderson Association copies.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.982
Look at the conditions.

44:15.110 --> 44:36.323
The first book, I'll show you another copy of the first book in what I think rightfully is called An Exhibition of Minding.

44:36.604 --> 44:41.912
I'll bring it up.

44:41.932 --> 44:42.433
Oh boy.

44:45.383 --> 44:49.370
Well, we're holding here, Story of the Glittering Plain, again, William Morris.

44:50.572 --> 44:53.477
How would you describe this lining?

44:55.200 --> 44:55.821
Oh, my God.

44:58.986 --> 44:59.927
Sorry to open it.

45:00.168 --> 45:02.271
It's a good lining.

45:02.291 --> 45:03.473
I never opened a book all the way.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.258
It's a linen.

45:06.979 --> 45:09.163
No, that's called...

45:10.173 --> 45:12.055
I don't believe it.

45:12.075 --> 45:13.817
Do I believe what I'm reading inside?

45:14.397 --> 45:17.941
That's that ambiguous English language I was telling you about.

45:19.062 --> 45:19.162
Yeah.

45:19.182 --> 45:20.623
It says inside.

45:20.683 --> 45:22.525
Whose hand did you think this is in?

45:22.765 --> 45:23.406
It's not Morris's.

45:23.546 --> 45:24.407
No, no.

45:24.427 --> 45:29.472
But it says the first book printed at the Kelmscott Press.

45:29.492 --> 45:34.177
Now, does that mean it's the first copy of the first book?

45:34.197 --> 45:35.057
I wonder.

45:35.077 --> 45:36.299
That's the ambiguity.

45:36.319 --> 45:38.661
But I think that with that binding,

45:39.417 --> 45:42.862
Are there any other copies of this book that you know of with this binding?

45:44.465 --> 45:45.687
How can I know of?

45:45.707 --> 45:49.212
Is there anything else that would distinguish it other than the binding?

45:49.393 --> 45:50.394
There's no other identification.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.516
Is this a Morris design?

45:52.578 --> 45:52.898
No.

45:53.219 --> 46:02.153
It's designed by Riviere and Son, who are London bookbinders, but it's obviously inspired by Morris's order.

46:02.533 --> 46:04.817
You have to hold it with a major book.

46:05.084 --> 46:09.755
My guess, may I make it, may I, uh, it's the first book published at the Colm Sky Press.

46:09.775 --> 46:12.622
I like that idea, but I can't prove it.

46:13.243 --> 46:14.206
You can't, sir.

46:14.546 --> 46:17.814
But I'm looking at what I see, which is an extraordinary.

46:18.075 --> 46:19.899
But that's the trouble with this language.

46:21.082 --> 46:23.768
It's the trouble with this passion, too, when you're going to be sure.

46:24.811 --> 46:30.596
Was that case made for it when it was issued, do you think?

46:30.617 --> 46:31.237
Yes.

46:31.317 --> 46:33.299
Again, there's another piece of evidence.

46:33.379 --> 46:40.966
Here's the literary silk, the ivory button, the whole thing.

46:40.986 --> 46:43.349
With the background that you have, do you have any gifts?

46:43.369 --> 46:43.869
We can't.

46:44.249 --> 46:45.671
There's nothing.

46:45.791 --> 46:50.375
I've never read anything that would refer to this particular copy.

46:50.395 --> 46:51.156
It says the first book.

46:51.946 --> 46:58.715
...exams to Oxford.

46:59.055 --> 47:01.118
Morris is studying for the entry exams at Oxford.

47:01.138 --> 47:02.700
These are the Odes of Horace.

47:04.702 --> 47:13.513
And here's a drawing by Morris of a peg-legged man holding up a signboard saying, W. Morris is Horace.

47:15.976 --> 47:16.637
That's cute.

47:19.435 --> 47:36.792
And I got Father Monaghan to translate this Latin writing here, which translates, a proposition is said to be converted, of which the extremes are transposed.

47:37.453 --> 47:38.113
What does it mean?

47:39.014 --> 47:40.756
Just exactly what it says.

47:41.437 --> 47:45.421
Now, if you want it in Latin, the same thing in Latin.

47:45.441 --> 47:48.103
And he says it on the other hand.

47:48.123 --> 47:48.784
There it is.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.523
William Morris, W. Morris.

47:51.943 --> 47:52.503
W. Morris.

47:52.604 --> 47:53.204
March 21.

47:53.324 --> 47:58.449
March 21, 1851.

47:59.691 --> 48:03.995
That looks like a seven, but it's the crossbar of the five.

48:04.035 --> 48:07.158
And then DCA, nobody's been able to translate.

48:08.039 --> 48:10.662
But here's a drawing of the church and the spire.

48:11.602 --> 48:17.168
See, when Morris was three years old, he could read.

48:17.890 --> 48:23.358
By the time he was four, he had read all of Scott's Waverly novels.

48:24.499 --> 48:40.181
His father would take him—his father was a stock and bonds dealer who had a bunch of copper-mining things that suddenly became enormously valuable.

48:40.381 --> 48:47.391
So, Morris grew up as a child, one of eight of his children.

48:47.725 --> 48:53.333
but the only one who had the genius, but in a wealthy family.

48:53.413 --> 49:03.727
And his father was well-educated and would take Morris as just a child to visit churches and cathedrals and all the important buildings.

49:04.407 --> 49:15.382
And Morris absorbed and read everything he could get out and remembered, understood and remembered everything from day one.

49:15.402 --> 49:16.604
And this, again, was from a dealer?

49:17.245 --> 49:17.445
Yeah.

49:18.708 --> 49:22.533
Do these dealers offer these things to you generally, do you think?

49:23.834 --> 49:29.361
I mean, before they catalog them, would you get a call and say, Sandy, I've got something you've got to have, right?

49:29.381 --> 49:30.021
Frequently.

49:30.041 --> 49:32.044
And what do you say when they tell you you've got to have it?

49:32.604 --> 49:34.026
I first have to say, how much?

49:35.968 --> 49:44.078
And then they will, if I say, sounds like it, then they'll send it really on approval, but I don't think they'll ever send it.

49:44.098 --> 49:46.521
There's a wonderful story in the book, Infinite Riches.

49:47.210 --> 49:50.254
where it describes you going up to... You read that.

49:50.274 --> 49:51.395
Yeah, you read that, yeah.

49:52.417 --> 49:52.537
Yeah.

49:52.777 --> 49:55.561
He was a great dealer.

49:55.841 --> 49:56.702
David McGee.

49:56.722 --> 50:03.871
You actually went, you know, I mean, you said, I think, at some point, these are no longer, be very careful, these are no longer yours.

50:03.972 --> 50:09.499
I mean... And that was even before I'd gotten hell out of it.

50:09.519 --> 50:12.002
You should be very careful with my experience.

50:12.022 --> 50:13.464
These aren't yours anymore.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.186
These aren't yours anymore.

50:15.206 --> 50:16.828
As a matter of fact, what had happened...

50:17.315 --> 50:18.576
Those rolled-up drawings.

50:18.757 --> 50:22.862
He was carrying a bunch, and he dropped them.

50:22.882 --> 50:23.302
That's why I said it.

50:23.322 --> 50:25.164
The rolled-up drawings we just saw in the closet.

50:25.184 --> 50:28.228
In the closet, yeah.

50:28.248 --> 50:32.353
And as I recall, you dropped everything to go see that stuff.

50:32.373 --> 50:32.513
Oh.

50:32.553 --> 50:34.816
Whatever it was that you were doing it at the beginning of the day.

50:35.897 --> 50:36.077
Oh, yeah.

50:36.117 --> 50:44.927
He said I broke the speed limits driving from Berkeley to Stanford.

50:44.947 --> 50:45.188
What was it?

50:45.208 --> 50:45.328
Three.

50:45.348 --> 50:45.448
Okay.

50:47.420 --> 51:06.607
I would be pleased if I could claim that my wife Helen and I started with the goal of assembling a collection of examples of every medium in which William Morris and his colleagues worked.

51:06.627 --> 51:11.233
The fact of the matter is that our collection began December 1965 with the modest goal

51:12.530 --> 51:13.471
All right.

51:13.491 --> 51:19.680
I do not wish to seem mystical or superstitious, but it was as if the collection willed itself into being.

51:20.661 --> 51:29.554
Our success probably can be accounted for by, quote, having been in the right place at the right time, close quote, except that there have been so many coincidences.

51:30.655 --> 51:31.817
And that's true.

51:31.937 --> 51:33.099
That's the spooky part.

51:33.119 --> 51:35.663
Yeah, and that's what makes it a wonderful thing, wonderful.

51:35.903 --> 51:38.166
Yeah.

51:38.939 --> 51:40.922
It was a fantastic bunch of unique stuff.

51:40.942 --> 51:41.042
Yeah.

51:41.142 --> 51:46.770
So they bought it at the Cockrells sale, and it was the ephemera letters, stuff like that.

51:49.033 --> 51:49.354
Stuff like that.

51:49.374 --> 51:50.656
You said, as you said, Kelmscott Press.

51:50.676 --> 51:54.061
The first two to three years was only Kelmscott Press.

51:54.081 --> 51:54.842
Of your collection.

51:54.902 --> 51:55.903
Of our collection.

51:55.923 --> 51:56.083
Okay.

51:56.103 --> 51:57.846
Kelmscott Press, only at the beginning.

51:57.866 --> 51:58.547
Only at the beginning.

51:58.567 --> 52:04.395
And as you just said, William Morris Company was a totally separate operation from the press.

52:04.776 --> 52:04.896
Right.

52:05.348 --> 52:08.873
But now you've decided to take the plunge and go from... This was the trigger.

52:09.734 --> 52:12.157
The embroidered fire screen.

52:12.178 --> 52:16.904
The embroidered fire screen changed it, which was just for admiring.

52:20.048 --> 52:21.831
And I said, okay, I'll take it.

52:22.212 --> 52:25.556
And I said, may I have the photograph and the shirt?

52:25.656 --> 52:26.598
I put it in an envelope.

52:27.459 --> 52:30.223
And I had already a date to meet Helen for lunch.

52:31.344 --> 52:33.347
So we met at the restaurant.

52:33.867 --> 52:38.894
ordered a drink, and I took the photograph out and said, I bought it.

52:39.655 --> 52:43.641
And she said, that's nice, thinking I had bought the photograph.

52:44.402 --> 52:50.691
And then when I said, no, I bought the window, her first words were, what are you going to do with it?

52:52.955 --> 52:53.556
I'm going to mad at it.

52:54.337 --> 52:55.999
Just as you said now.

52:56.079 --> 52:57.702
It's gorgeous as it is.

52:57.722 --> 52:59.424
What are you going to do with it?

53:00.105 --> 53:03.570
Sandy, where's she from?

53:04.428 --> 53:21.209
This is one of the translations by William Morris and Erika Magnusson of one of the Icelandic sagas, and it's one of twelve copies for private circulation only.

53:22.371 --> 53:34.266
It's got Byrne-Jones, Townscott Press bookplate, inscribed to Ned from W.M., Ned being Edward.

53:34.415 --> 53:44.690
page, Caraja Morris has illuminated as a gift to E.B.J.

53:45.071 --> 53:48.315
Edward Bernard Jones.

53:48.335 --> 53:48.896
It's unique.

53:49.357 --> 53:52.121
Oh, yeah.

53:52.141 --> 54:02.616
This was 1870, and that was the year that he did the illuminated

54:02.782 --> 54:08.089
book called Book of Verse that he gave to Georgiana Berne-Jones.

54:09.311 --> 54:15.939
The story of the Volsung, V-O-L-S-U-N-G-S, and Niblungs, N-I-B-L-U-N-G-S, Chapter 1.

54:16.039 --> 54:22.868
And on this page, a little circle at the bottom, E-E-J, which you've already described.

54:22.888 --> 54:28.175
And it's a prologan verse on the page somewhere around, Morris.

54:28.195 --> 54:28.576
So beautiful.

54:32.000 --> 54:32.721
See, Morris

54:33.764 --> 54:40.651
did illuminated manuscript work as relaxation on weekends.

54:40.671 --> 54:45.736
Oh, my boy.

54:50.260 --> 54:50.480
Relaxation.

54:50.500 --> 54:54.965
Mine must have been incredible.

54:54.985 --> 55:02.252
These are two of the manuscripts you get.

55:02.435 --> 55:20.381
The Book of Earth, the same year as the Volsungs and the Negroes, he designed the binder to the marvelous facsimiles, and to Georgiana Byrne-Jones.

55:20.401 --> 55:26.710
But you can see the title page.

55:26.750 --> 55:30.315
That was done by Charles Fairfax Murray,

55:31.747 --> 55:46.165
who was a painting assistant to Bernard Jones, but Morris would hire him to do the miniaturization of some of those figure drawings that I have shown you.

55:47.827 --> 55:54.234
And I'll show you that this is entirely by hand by modern.

55:54.254 --> 55:55.576
No, this is a facsimile here.

55:55.616 --> 55:56.637
This is a facsimile.

55:56.697 --> 55:58.800
The original's at the Victorian Album.

55:59.776 --> 56:08.566
And he got Byrne Jones to do that painting.

56:09.627 --> 56:11.530
Well, you've got to do something to relax.

56:11.550 --> 56:12.951
Oh, my God.

56:12.971 --> 56:13.572
It's incredibly long.

56:13.592 --> 56:14.113
Weekend.

56:14.273 --> 56:20.140
I didn't know anybody.

56:20.160 --> 56:24.445
You know, illuminated manuscripts are something that was supposed to be done over the Renaissance.

56:24.465 --> 56:24.905
It did.

56:25.686 --> 56:27.488
Here, hold on to this painting.

56:30.893 --> 56:32.376
It's quite a lovely facsimile.

56:33.598 --> 56:36.884
It's a beautiful facsimile.

56:36.905 --> 56:42.054
They did a cheaper copy of it, which is also very good.

56:42.074 --> 56:47.064
This was a special edition.

56:47.084 --> 56:52.294
Generosity, charity, justice, mercy, humility.

57:00.830 --> 57:09.302
Here are two studies for this lady here.

57:09.362 --> 57:23.383
He would have Charles Fairfax Murray do the actual painting on this scale.

57:25.226 --> 57:26.568
Another example.

57:26.588 --> 57:30.313
So you can see, here's 1870.

57:31.340 --> 57:38.928
The first Kelskot Press book is 1891, so he's well into proportion of margins and the whole concept of Booker.

57:41.771 --> 57:42.792
Now, another one.

57:42.812 --> 57:46.536
You'd love to have that book in your collection, wouldn't you?

57:46.556 --> 57:48.939
It's hard to get things away from .

57:48.959 --> 57:57.027
It's equally hard to get things away from the British Library, who has the original .

58:02.575 --> 58:06.038
This he also did for George Adams.

58:06.058 --> 58:15.207
He would just do one copy of it.

58:15.227 --> 58:15.908
Oh, yeah.

58:16.008 --> 58:17.249
God, can you imagine doing another?

58:17.269 --> 58:21.794
Yeah, but what I'm saying is that there would be no attempt to do... No commercialization?

58:22.334 --> 58:24.396
No.

58:24.416 --> 58:28.560
Look at the lady sitting in the chair there.

58:28.580 --> 58:30.642
That is she?

58:30.824 --> 58:32.907
So these are working sketches?

58:33.167 --> 58:34.869
The concept stage.

58:35.069 --> 58:37.252
How did he survive, would you say?

58:37.512 --> 58:38.754
This was all in the archives.

58:39.595 --> 58:44.861
They must have been among these drapery studies for windows.

58:44.941 --> 58:54.473
And as you mentioned, as he scooped up all the window-related documents, he scooped everything inside, I'm sure.

58:56.015 --> 58:58.097
I wouldn't have left the dust.

58:59.933 --> 59:01.715
That's a great story.

59:01.735 --> 59:05.258
Yeah, so that's how these guys, that's part of this 140.

59:05.578 --> 59:11.864
And how have you, it must have taken you a tremendous amount of time to make the connection between those things and those things.

59:11.884 --> 59:14.407
It did, it did.

59:14.687 --> 59:18.531
But tell me about, you got these things, what happens?

59:18.551 --> 59:20.012
What do you say to yourself?

59:20.032 --> 59:21.694
I'm going to find out what these things are for.

59:21.714 --> 59:22.214
Absolutely.

59:23.095 --> 59:26.198
I mean, is this something you know you're going to do intuitively or immediately?

59:26.278 --> 59:26.819
What happens?

59:27.259 --> 59:28.320
You get this and what do you say?

59:28.340 --> 59:29.181
Just know it has to be done.

59:29.735 --> 59:31.157
What was that for?

59:31.237 --> 59:33.159
And so then, when you find it, you say what?

59:33.560 --> 59:33.720
Wow!

59:36.063 --> 59:37.605
I don't mean to put words in your mouth.

59:37.965 --> 59:38.266
That's it.

59:38.286 --> 59:39.988
That's the right word.

59:40.008 --> 59:59.252
See, and then, it took a long time to find, to identify which drawing went with which figure in which window.

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:02.206
Oh, you did the window search, too.

01:00:02.226 --> 01:00:03.668
Oh, that's where it loads.

01:00:04.249 --> 01:00:06.052
Now, this is what I was saying.

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:10.699
We had 700 of these jewel-like drawers.

01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:11.961
Did this also come to the archives?

01:00:11.981 --> 01:00:15.006
This is part of the archives.

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:16.488
How large was the archives?

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:21.035
Two crates, each one the size of an automobile.

01:00:21.055 --> 01:00:21.436
God.

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:26.083
Just look.

01:00:27.785 --> 01:00:31.610
How could England allow that to leave the country?

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:36.857
Oh, I think there had to be illegal.

01:00:38.399 --> 01:00:40.402
I don't want to use the word smuggle.

01:00:44.568 --> 01:00:46.350
I mean, because...
