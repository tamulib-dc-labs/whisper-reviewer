WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:03.660
Okay, taping, okay.

00:04.841 --> 00:05.402
Welcome back.

00:06.203 --> 00:06.864
When did you get back?

00:06.984 --> 00:08.486
When did you get over from Italy?

00:08.706 --> 00:09.147
Saturday.

00:09.307 --> 00:15.094
Okay, so I'm still jet lagged, but I have to get up early, so it's serving me.

00:15.114 --> 00:15.975
Starting in Philly?

00:16.616 --> 00:18.939
Yeah, New York yesterday, but they didn't do anything.

00:19.039 --> 00:22.404
Okay, well, this is an interesting situation with this book.

00:23.305 --> 00:25.768
Not the situation so much with the Esquire.

00:26.339 --> 00:29.823
What do you make of all this?

00:29.883 --> 00:36.810
I read the story, I have to say, I was expecting this pornographic thing.

00:36.830 --> 00:48.903
I said, Jesus Christ, there's nothing... In some ways I'm the wrong person to ask because I was completely... I never had any contact with any of the principals in this story.

00:48.943 --> 00:51.125
I never talked to Will Blythe, I never talked to Ed Kozner.

00:51.826 --> 00:53.207
I was working with another editor there.

00:53.828 --> 01:11.235
But my impression is that this is simply a case of a kind of huge overreaction on the part of a very nervous publisher who was worried because the magazine, from what I gather, has been losing ad pages and was afraid that the story might offend advertisers.

01:11.275 --> 01:15.381
The more interesting question is what was it about the story that made it?

01:15.918 --> 01:21.268
her so jumpy when you considered that, you know, the March issue of Esquire had a ruler on the cover.

01:21.348 --> 01:24.394
Which is amazing, which embarrassed me to show it to my daughter.

01:24.654 --> 01:26.958
Yeah, it was, it was, I mean.

01:27.059 --> 01:31.868
I mean, it was really amazing, the cover, the ruler.

01:32.088 --> 01:32.348
Oh, I know.

01:32.368 --> 01:34.272
Goes from 6 to 12 or something like that.

01:35.053 --> 01:35.935
You know, I mean.

01:36.607 --> 01:38.349
And it says the male ego or something.

01:38.369 --> 01:47.762
And we're talking, you know, we're mentioning penises in the book, but we're actually giving the graphic an illustration of one on the cover of the magazine.

01:47.782 --> 01:56.214
I mean, I don't think it's anything so simple as the fact that it was, at first I thought it was just a homophobic period of people, but I think it's more subtle than that.

01:56.234 --> 01:58.817
I think something about the combination of the

01:59.877 --> 02:19.638
fact that it has a protagonist called David Levitt and that there are these straight boys in UCLA proposing these kinds of indecent bargains, the whole effect of the story might have... I think it was something about the story itself that must have made people uncomfortable.

02:19.658 --> 02:24.703
And to a certain extent, I take that as a compliment because I wanted the story to

02:25.544 --> 02:26.966
have a provocative effect.

02:27.467 --> 02:28.749
Yeah, well, there is background.

02:28.769 --> 02:37.863
I mean, the New York Times did publish quite a large story within the last six months or so about the misfortunes at Esquire.

02:38.183 --> 02:43.331
You know, I mean, it still has a good circulation, but it has lost a definition of itself.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.738
And advertisers will say, well, where the hell is this magazine going?

02:47.718 --> 03:00.455
And it is interesting that the worst thing that can happen in any business is that somebody in charge of advertising takes a look at a copy and has input as to whether or not the thing is going to be published.

03:00.635 --> 03:07.384
And I hadn't even thought about it until I read some story about a Jeep being mentioned as a meeting place for a tryst.

03:07.404 --> 03:11.329
I mean, that's exactly the kind of thing that they go crazy over.

03:11.309 --> 03:13.232
But who's to say?

03:13.272 --> 03:20.682
The problem is I can't really know, because the only people who can really answer these questions are the people at Esquire, and they're not talking.

03:20.702 --> 03:27.971
Yeah, but I've got to tell you, having read the story, the novella, I said, there's the problem here.

03:27.991 --> 03:29.053
We're mature adults.

03:29.113 --> 03:32.878
I mean, I really expected a lot more.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.199
A lot different.

03:35.239 --> 03:37.762
I mean, it's a funny story, I think, actually, this humor there.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.225
I think people are failing to see the humor in it.

03:40.726 --> 03:43.048
Maybe you didn't intend it to be humorous.

03:43.068 --> 03:46.012
Oh, no, I intended it to be very humorous.

03:46.172 --> 04:01.650
And, in fact, they bought the story in August, and all I heard from the day that the story was bought until the surprising facts arrived from Ed Kozner was how much everybody there loved it and how proud they were to be publishing it and

04:02.170 --> 04:12.679
I got the feeling that the people in the editorial side of the magazine really saw this story as part of an opportunity to regain Esquire's old reputation.

04:13.080 --> 04:13.720
Macho man.

04:16.062 --> 04:17.143
But not so much that.

04:17.463 --> 04:22.828
The days when Esquire would send Jean Genet to the Democratic Convention.

04:23.008 --> 04:26.712
I thought you meant their image as the Hemingway kind of magazine.

04:27.052 --> 04:30.675
Before that, they had this reputation for being fairly daring.

04:31.735 --> 04:41.273
and so uh you know when when the one thing that i found very offensive was when kosner started

04:42.097 --> 04:47.484
bad-mouthing the story and saying that he'd made this decision weeks before, which is absolutely untrue.

04:47.504 --> 04:54.873
Yeah, that's the part that pisses you off is when they start to lie about, when they have to justify their reasons when the reasons are so transparently obvious.

04:56.375 --> 04:57.556
You'd respect them more.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.318
And this is not for my piece, really.

04:59.338 --> 05:00.940
I'm just fascinated by them.

05:01.261 --> 05:08.410
There is a kind of an underlying irony here, isn't there, when you open this story and you do tell a lot of the factual stuff that happened to you.

05:08.430 --> 05:08.830
Yeah.

05:08.810 --> 05:13.096
And you mentioned Viking and Salman Rushdie and your experience with them.

05:14.037 --> 05:19.645
And then, you know, it's almost a repetition in a similar manner here, isn't it, in a way?

05:20.486 --> 05:38.631
It is kind of ironic that of all the stories, the other thing that I find ironic is that this is a story about a writer trying to regain a certain privacy and to get out of the cycle of the media.

05:39.033 --> 05:48.948
And what should happen but that this particular story should cause a scandal and therefore put its author into the middle of a kind of media service.

05:48.968 --> 05:50.470
Of all the stories for it to happen to.

05:50.831 --> 05:59.344
Another kind of, it's not amusing for you, but you mentioned, you know, as this guy Ben is reading the story, you feel like you're sitting next to Michiko.

05:59.804 --> 06:03.670
And then she whacks you in the times anyway.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.112
I know.

06:05.132 --> 06:05.513
I know.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.996
Go figure, you know.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.439
It's almost your worst fear realized over there.

06:11.441 --> 06:14.524
I feel that she misread the story myself, to be honest with you.

06:14.585 --> 06:18.229
Again, I'm not planning to discuss other reviews on my stories.

06:18.489 --> 06:19.250
I appreciate that.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.694
You can't go by what you read all the time, can you?

06:23.135 --> 06:27.801
We met you and I some years ago when you came through Boston.

06:27.941 --> 06:29.564
I think you were with Morrow at the time.

06:29.984 --> 06:32.327
A Viking, probably.

06:32.307 --> 06:33.870
I think it was pre-Viking.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.754
Maybe it was with Weidenfeld.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.038
Were you with Morrow at all?

06:38.118 --> 06:38.278
No.

06:38.559 --> 06:41.003
Okay, so I think it must have been Weidenfeld.

06:41.064 --> 06:44.109
Yeah, one book.

06:44.129 --> 06:44.731
It still existed.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.616
It's not funny, I thought it was Morrow.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.231
You look pretty good at this.

06:51.074 --> 06:57.983
I mean, the title clearly does suggest, and then you give us the provenance of the source of the title.

06:58.003 --> 07:01.407
I mean, was there a sense of escaping for you?

07:01.467 --> 07:06.854
I mean, did you want to go into a kind of Arkansas in the Oscar Wilde sense?

07:07.255 --> 07:09.137
Oh, I absolutely wanted to.

07:10.219 --> 07:16.587
The irony, of course, was that, like the protagonist of all three of these novellas, I couldn't.

07:16.607 --> 07:17.248
You know, you...

07:18.157 --> 07:38.967
The irony of that title and that epigraph is that, of course, such a place, such a sort of paradise of exile, to borrow a phrase from Shelley, can never really exist because things follow you.

07:41.174 --> 08:04.309
And that to me was the link between the three novellas, the idea that all three of them had to do with people trying to escape things inside themselves by going to a different place, whether it's Los Angeles or in the Second Story, Italy, and discovering that to do so is really impossible.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.333
Why three novellas and not a novel?

08:08.512 --> 08:10.475
Well, I became very interested in the novella.

08:10.495 --> 08:17.203
I started off by writing Saturn Street, and the reason I wrote it as a novella was because at that point I was very, very blocked.

08:17.243 --> 08:22.670
I'd been trying to write a novel for several years, and I'd never been able to get past page 80.

08:23.531 --> 08:35.987
I had six versions of the first 80 pages, and I started writing Saturn Street as a kind of exercise to free up my creativity because it had been such a long time since I'd finished anything.

08:36.828 --> 08:39.531
I figured maybe the thing to do would be to try something shorter.

08:39.932 --> 08:43.436
And I initially intended it as a story, but it grew longer than a story.

08:44.657 --> 08:50.824
After that, I became very fascinated by the form.

08:51.325 --> 08:54.708
I've always loved short novels, for example, Muriel Sparks novels.

08:55.830 --> 09:03.498
And Forster defined the novel as a prose narrative of less than 50,000 words.

09:03.539 --> 09:04.860
And I thought, well, what about those

09:05.549 --> 09:09.254
things that are too long to be stories and too short to be novels, and I started reading a lot.

09:09.314 --> 09:16.182
And I found it in extremely a form that was full of possibilities, perhaps because of its unorthodox length.

09:16.683 --> 09:20.808
And I was reading a lot of Alan Gerganis' novellas.

09:21.188 --> 09:23.451
Certainly not his novel, if we're talking brevity.

09:23.711 --> 09:25.393
Oh, yeah.

09:25.413 --> 09:28.837
But I love some of the sort of seven, 100-page pieces he writes.

09:28.857 --> 09:30.760
And I reread Death in Venice.

09:31.901 --> 09:33.964
I read some of Jane Smiley's novellas again.

09:34.684 --> 09:35.185
And I just...

09:35.620 --> 09:37.262
fell in love with the form.

09:37.282 --> 09:46.893
I had the sense here in the title novella that there is a pleasure in re-reading and the re-discovery of old novels.

09:47.173 --> 09:48.935
Did you go through something like this particularly?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.377
You're talking about James and Forrester.

09:50.717 --> 09:53.280
Yeah.

09:53.300 --> 10:00.789
That was to a great degree for me the result of living in Italy and not having access to new books.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.513
So I would read old books because

10:05.118 --> 10:15.813
When I was living in Florence and I would go to the American bookshop there, it's a bookshop that fundamentally caters to students having their junior years abroad.

10:16.534 --> 10:19.117
And so they stock lots of Henry James and lots of B.M.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.960
Forster and lots of D.H.

10:21.000 --> 10:21.440
Lawrence.

10:22.382 --> 10:26.547
And so those were the writers I started reading because I hadn't read any of them since I've been in college.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.232
Were you already embarked in this particular story?

10:30.332 --> 10:33.657
I mean, are these borrowings, these are things that kind of come into the

10:34.160 --> 10:35.301
That actually happened before.

10:35.321 --> 10:39.767
I wrote the term paper artist after I wrote Saturn Street.

10:40.508 --> 10:53.143
And it was in a very oblique way, a way of talking about what had happened to me in the years between the Spender lawsuit and... You're talking about now the term paper artist.

10:53.163 --> 10:53.883
The term paper artist.

10:53.903 --> 10:54.084
Right.

10:55.425 --> 11:00.371
But this came after you had written the other story, the other novella.

11:00.611 --> 11:01.052
Saturn Street.

11:01.252 --> 11:01.553
Right.

11:01.573 --> 11:01.973
Yes.

11:02.932 --> 11:16.209
So did you see that you were, did you envision what you were doing as, that you were embarked on a kind of exorcism that you were going to, did you expect that you would get to the term paper artist?

11:16.730 --> 11:17.271
No.

11:17.371 --> 11:17.431
No.

11:17.511 --> 11:21.536
Because that clearly is the next phase in the creative process.

11:21.716 --> 11:21.817
Yeah.

11:22.337 --> 11:26.883
But it's the central, you know, it's certainly the only story everybody's talking about right now.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.286
I mean, unfairly, I think.

11:29.406 --> 11:32.230
Well, looking back, it makes sense.

11:32.632 --> 11:35.957
that I was on my way to writing the term paper artist.

11:35.977 --> 11:39.162
But I wasn't conscious of that at the time.

11:41.185 --> 11:43.028
At the time of composition, of course.

11:43.289 --> 11:44.290
Yeah.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.273
Never is.

11:46.294 --> 11:49.438
But do you feel that this has been an exorcism for you?

11:50.340 --> 11:51.682
It was a very liberating book.

11:52.263 --> 11:53.885
It was a very freeing book for me.

11:55.107 --> 11:59.314
It was not only freeing in the sense of helping me to

11:59.902 --> 12:19.964
in a psychological sense, to exercise a lot of demons, but also it provided me with an opportunity to try to expand my range.

12:19.985 --> 12:23.208
Maybe the pun I should use is exercise and exercise.

12:23.388 --> 12:24.229
Yeah, okay.

12:24.830 --> 12:25.991
They both apply, I guess.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.474
Yeah, and I felt...

12:28.825 --> 12:45.809
that I was able to get out of a certain repetitiveness that I was falling into in that novel that I was never able to finish, where it seemed to me that I was constantly going back and repeating ideas that I'd already written about.

12:47.011 --> 12:58.647
And I think most writers go through that phase, you know, where you maybe you can verify from your experience, you know, where you suddenly you go through a period when you really feel like you're spinning your wheels.

12:59.065 --> 13:05.575
And you know that some kind of leap is on the horizon, or at least you hope that some sort of leap is on the horizon.

13:06.497 --> 13:16.012
And then once it comes and you make that leap onto another level, you look back and you realize that that whole time you were spinning your wheels, you were actually preparing for it.

13:16.372 --> 13:20.078
What's a famous New Yorker cartoon a writer isn't always writing when he's writing?

13:20.210 --> 13:21.974
Yeah, exactly.

13:21.994 --> 13:25.160
That's the guy lying down in the hammock in the backyard.

13:26.242 --> 13:31.333
But, of course, the fear is that it'll never happen, that you'll keep waiting and waiting and waiting, and it'll never come.

13:31.754 --> 13:35.822
Do you think that you said what you have to say about that Spender incident?

13:36.410 --> 13:44.378
So you don't think that really a non-fiction treatment at some point, from your point of view, is necessary?

13:44.559 --> 13:45.159
Not at the moment.

13:45.179 --> 13:47.081
I mean, I wrote the introduction to the revised.

13:47.261 --> 13:47.762
Exactly.

13:48.182 --> 14:00.055
And if someday I write my memoirs, which is something I don't anticipate doing any time in the near future, I might talk about it.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.291
Well, I mean, you're still well on the other side of 40.

14:04.851 --> 14:10.537
Well, exactly, but that doesn't seem to be stopping anyone else from writing their memoirs.

14:10.577 --> 14:12.179
Without naming any names, I'm looking.

14:12.199 --> 14:18.565
Well, as long as the memoir remains trendy and gets onto the front page of the New York Times, I'm not writing one.

14:18.985 --> 14:22.028
Did you see the piece in Sunday's Times about this whole genre?

14:22.289 --> 14:23.069
Yes.

14:23.089 --> 14:25.952
And this woman has written a memoir about an affair with her father.

14:25.992 --> 14:26.633
Yeah.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.072
and doesn't want you to try and identify them.

14:29.092 --> 14:30.656
So why does she write the book, I wonder?

14:30.997 --> 14:31.519
I don't know.

14:31.699 --> 14:32.261
I haven't read it.

14:32.281 --> 14:37.193
A friend of mine was telling me that she read it expecting to hate it and actually thought it was very good.

14:37.955 --> 14:42.647
I saw a very positive blurb from Toby Wolfe in Today's Times, which kind of...

14:43.268 --> 14:44.971
So you really can't tell, can you?

14:44.991 --> 14:46.053
You have to read this thing.

14:47.115 --> 14:50.340
That's the strange thing about the period we're living in.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.265
You know, it's like what... I heard George Steiner speak last year.

14:54.046 --> 14:54.287
Where?

14:54.948 --> 14:55.289
In Rome.

14:55.589 --> 14:55.850
Really?

14:56.150 --> 14:56.370
Yeah.

14:56.491 --> 14:58.915
I've been hoping to get an interview with him.

14:58.955 --> 15:01.018
I was in England a couple weeks ago for this.

15:01.038 --> 15:01.599
Anyway, go ahead.

15:02.321 --> 15:03.683
I think he's such a genius.

15:04.164 --> 15:04.264
Yeah.

15:04.531 --> 15:33.036
and uh he was he was so impressive it spurred me to read real presences where he talks about that whole idea of the secondary city exactly that's in the new the new book from yale i think isn't it uh i think so yeah but this idea that we live in a culture where people basically read more texts about other texts than read the books themselves you know where everybody and you find this in new york all the time everybody reads the reviews everybody reads the interviews and then

15:33.877 --> 15:36.121
I just did it a few minutes ago.

15:36.221 --> 15:38.926
I said, well, I haven't read it, but I've heard that.

15:40.289 --> 15:42.173
And we fall into this kind of language.

15:42.693 --> 15:48.404
And it kind of scares me because it seems to me we're approaching a time when there won't be any need for books.

15:49.386 --> 15:52.071
There'll just be, you know, talk about books.

15:53.283 --> 15:54.905
Well, then, of course, who's who?

15:54.925 --> 15:56.467
Who will be writing the books at that point?

15:56.487 --> 16:01.274
You know, down at Brown University, they have this, in fact, I have to get down there, Bob Coover's.

16:01.754 --> 16:02.515
Oh, yeah.

16:02.736 --> 16:07.422
This whole interactive fiction department where, go ahead, I'm sorry, you were about to say something.

16:07.442 --> 16:08.223
I've heard about that.

16:08.363 --> 16:12.709
Yeah, and there's another guy down there who wrote this book called Hypertext.

16:13.111 --> 16:15.573
And Landau, I think is his name.

16:15.613 --> 16:16.754
He's down there too.

16:16.814 --> 16:20.298
And they actually have novels that they put up there on the web.

16:20.318 --> 16:22.540
I mean, this concerns me.

16:22.580 --> 16:29.626
It's suggesting that a novel is no longer the work of one individual or that it's subject to constant change.

16:29.666 --> 16:30.907
I agree.

16:31.468 --> 16:37.773
And I also think there's something a little bit scary about the novel not having a physical existence.

16:37.793 --> 16:42.898
I mean, there's something very comforting to me about the physical fact of a book.

16:43.688 --> 16:47.836
It is not the same to read scrolling text on a computer screen.

16:48.257 --> 16:54.891
Well, a couple of weeks ago, about four weeks ago, I went down to MIT to the media lab there, which you've probably heard of.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.053
Yeah.

16:56.073 --> 17:03.047
And I'd read a little item about the book of the future that they're developing there, you know, in great secrecy.

17:03.922 --> 17:10.292
And I went in and, you know, you see a name in the newspaper, Professor Joe Jacobson.

17:10.312 --> 17:13.557
So, you know, you expect to see a guy in his 50s maybe, right?

17:13.577 --> 17:15.700
This is a 31-year-old kid.

17:16.581 --> 17:17.603
And I said, you're young.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.684
And he said, is that an issue?

17:18.744 --> 17:20.587
And I said, in this case, I think it is.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.470
You know, it does take...

17:22.906 --> 17:47.648
somebody like 29 and now 30 31 year old joe jacobson to come up with what he calls the electronic book and and and it's a book that they're making and that they will have available in two to three to four years and the only thing holding them back is expense not technology but a book that looks like a book that has paper that looks like paper that has electronic ink and you can load each of these books with 3 000 different books

17:48.725 --> 18:15.306
and on the spine you can dial uh david levitt or whoever you want and it'll appear and it will appear on the page with like this electronic ink like a screen and it will even replicate the type the size of the type you can enlarge the type um and they're calling this the last book you know you'll ever need i mean something scary about that but it's the ephemeral nature i don't care if it's paper and if it's the physicality of the thing

18:15.826 --> 18:19.995
You know, when you still push the button, the page erases or it disappears.

18:20.536 --> 18:21.417
It's very scary.

18:23.321 --> 18:25.005
I don't know quite where I'm going with this just yet.

18:25.065 --> 18:27.871
No, but what about the wonderful smell of libraries?

18:27.891 --> 18:29.434
And that's what I write about, you know.

18:31.017 --> 18:33.362
But anyway, it is comforting to...

18:33.865 --> 18:39.093
to hear you say that there is something about the physicality of the book that you still... Absolutely.

18:39.113 --> 18:45.482
I haven't really questioned you about the content of these novellas, and I really try not to do that.

18:45.522 --> 18:50.188
I mean, that's my job to read them and to comment on them.

18:50.209 --> 18:56.818
And I do find that the fiction writers are the most interesting, most challenging to interview because...

18:57.710 --> 19:00.114
I mean, because I do have that responsibility.

19:01.856 --> 19:05.682
We have to kind of cut around the corners here and try and get some quotes.

19:06.563 --> 19:21.625
And I really don't like to ask you to comment on other reviews, and I never use them in my pieces, but I did sense in Michiko's piece that she's very concerned that you seem to use sex as the yardstick.

19:21.605 --> 19:46.026
of what she suggests is quote unquote gay fiction or a gay novel i mean how would you respond to that why and you know i didn't really see um well i mean certainly sex is at the center of these stories but is it necessary for sex to be such an important element i don't think it's it's necessary but at the same time i don't see why why sex is any

19:47.305 --> 20:15.439
less legitimate or more controversial an area of inquiry and human experience than any other I mean you know there seems to be a renewed squeamishness among critics these days writing about sex and I am a little bit perplexed by it simply because in the 70s and 80s people were writing about sex all the time without

20:16.803 --> 20:22.968
necessarily creating any kind of reaction on the part of a readership simply because they were writing about sex.

20:24.450 --> 20:33.337
I write about sex not for its own sake but because I think it's a very interesting way of exploring relationships.

20:33.678 --> 20:45.848
For me the difference between pornography and literary writing about sex is that pornography exists to arouse and literary writing about sex exists to explore the ways in which sex expresses

20:46.503 --> 20:48.566
the content of a relationship between two people.

20:49.407 --> 20:51.069
And this isn't a particularly new idea.

20:51.129 --> 21:00.662
This is something that, you know, since Freud has been a kind of commonplace among psychoanalysts.

21:00.682 --> 21:07.812
I mean, I remember a friend of mine is a shrink telling me that he had a professor who said, everything is about sex except for sex, which is about aggression.

21:08.513 --> 21:09.314
That's a great question.

21:09.334 --> 21:15.362
And so it doesn't seem to me a particularly, you know, wild or outrageous or even...

21:16.709 --> 21:18.352
risky thing to do.

21:18.412 --> 21:26.065
It simply seems one of several important areas of human experience that deserves to be talked about.

21:26.626 --> 21:32.076
You know, are you familiar with a book that was published not even a year ago called Push by Sapphire?

21:32.396 --> 21:34.440
Yeah, I didn't read it, but I'm familiar with it.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.764
And I read it, and I liked it, by the way, you know, again.

21:36.984 --> 21:39.308
But nobody mentioned...

21:39.642 --> 21:46.711
None of these same critics got bent out of shape by the unbelievable sexual content of that book.

21:46.771 --> 21:56.743
I mean, here's a young girl that is repeatedly raped by her father, has two children by him, has AIDS by him.

21:56.783 --> 22:00.047
And that seems to be the whole...

22:00.871 --> 22:22.491
essence of this particular book what i liked about it is that that you know this bittersweet resolution is through reading as to the discovery of words of the awareness that you can't read and i found that kind of endearing in a great way but none of these critics that read this book had any problem at all with the use of you know sexual themes and content and language that is

22:22.640 --> 22:26.005
believe me, far more explicit than anything I read in your book.

22:26.025 --> 22:27.407
Maybe it's because it's homosexual.

22:27.548 --> 22:27.968
I don't know.

22:28.529 --> 22:29.931
Well, I think that's what I'm saying.

22:29.951 --> 22:31.574
That's what I'm asking here.

22:32.675 --> 22:44.674
The only reason I would hesitate in the case of Michiko Kakitani to think that is that I have seen her go after other books for having a lot of sexual content that were not gay.

22:45.195 --> 22:48.580
For example, if I recall correctly,

22:49.673 --> 22:59.866
I think she was, maybe I'm wrong, maybe it wasn't her, but I thought she was going after Nicholson Baker after he published Vox for a similar reason.

23:00.366 --> 23:02.649
I mean, it may be that... I'll check that out.

23:03.170 --> 23:04.511
Are you online, by the way?

23:04.552 --> 23:05.112
No.

23:05.533 --> 23:10.919
Well, the New York Times now has a site, you know, you can search 50,000 reviews free going back to 1980.

23:10.939 --> 23:13.483
So, I mean, as soon as we finish, I'll go check.

23:13.503 --> 23:14.684
Yeah, I may be wrong about that.

23:15.025 --> 23:19.410
But I think that it may be more, maybe people don't,

23:19.728 --> 23:20.569
get more nervous.

23:20.609 --> 23:21.952
This is just a hypothesis.

23:22.553 --> 23:28.743
When sex is talked about as something fun, as opposed to when sex is talked about as something horrible.

23:29.644 --> 23:43.086
That is to say, if a book describes a girl being raped by her father getting AIDS, the ugly side of sex is somehow less disturbing to people than the idea of writing about

23:44.382 --> 23:49.030
people enjoying sex, especially enjoying sex in a perverse or unconventional way.

23:49.090 --> 24:01.590
I mean, I thought Vox was a masterpiece, and yet there was such a backlash against it, critically, simply because it was a kind of, it reveled in sex.

24:02.211 --> 24:06.238
Well, I was out in California a couple months ago, and I'm working on this new book.

24:07.231 --> 24:14.481
And, of course, you know what Baker's been saying about the San Francisco Public Library destroying all the card catalogs and disposing of books.

24:15.363 --> 24:18.808
And one of his biggest critics is Mike Keller down at Stanford.

24:18.968 --> 24:23.034
And he said, who can believe anything a pornographer?

24:23.735 --> 24:25.958
You know, he made this public comment.

24:25.978 --> 24:28.502
This is the head of the Stanford University Library.

24:28.522 --> 24:30.825
It came back at him as a...

24:30.805 --> 24:40.219
You know, totally irrelevant, even if it was, you know what I'm saying, he attacked him by the strength of that book.

24:40.240 --> 24:44.406
Well, you see, and he's not writing, I mean, he is as heterosexual as you can get.

24:44.426 --> 24:49.033
And yet he is having a lot of the same problems.

24:49.553 --> 24:51.935
I thought Vox was great.

24:51.975 --> 24:59.002
I didn't much like the Firmata, which I found a kind of attempt to do Vox a second time, not as successful.

24:59.022 --> 24:59.863
Revisited.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.665
But I really thought Vox was wonderful.

25:03.005 --> 25:03.486
Interesting.

25:03.786 --> 25:10.392
I can't say it was... I read it through, so that's going to stand for something.

25:11.353 --> 25:16.478
It seemed to me to say so much about certain kinds of obsessive sexuality.

25:16.558 --> 25:16.658
Yeah.

25:17.785 --> 25:18.486
Let me see.

25:18.506 --> 25:19.887
So what are you working on now?

25:20.368 --> 25:23.931
I'm just finishing a novel that's called The Page-Turner.

25:24.612 --> 25:24.993
Oh, I like.

25:25.553 --> 25:31.920
It refers, in this case, to the person who turns the pages for a pianist.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.001
Oh, very interesting.

25:33.221 --> 25:44.653
And it's about a former child prodigy pianist in his late 30s trying to make the transition from being a child prodigy to being just a musician.

25:45.595 --> 26:01.528
see my first image when you said the page turner i was just at the british library and they have they have a brand new computer called turning the pages really and uh it hasn't been this will be at the new british library and they're there is the reading room still open uh it is it's it's

26:01.508 --> 26:04.712
A lot of things have been stripped out of there.

26:04.732 --> 26:09.497
Books are moving to the new place at the rate of 10,000 volumes a day, which is... Oh, God.

26:09.517 --> 26:11.800
Because the Reading Room of Bear Sniper is one of my favorite places on earth.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.662
The new place is going to be wonderful, though.

26:13.702 --> 26:13.943
It is?

26:14.123 --> 26:14.463
Yeah.

26:14.623 --> 26:17.567
I had a tour of it a couple weeks ago.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.230
And what will they do with the old Reading Room?

26:21.031 --> 26:22.813
The museum is going to do something with it.

26:23.274 --> 26:26.217
And they've got a big capital program, and so...

26:26.197 --> 26:28.462
But you will love the new British Library.

26:28.482 --> 26:28.963
Oh, I'm sure.

26:28.983 --> 26:45.015
I spent a lot of time there last year because Mark Mitchell and I were researching this anthology we've just done about called Pages Passed from Hand to Hand, which is about the tradition of gay-themed fiction in English from the 18th century through World War I.

26:45.788 --> 26:47.071
How do you mean by hand-to-hand?

26:48.014 --> 26:50.259
Well, the title refers... Hasn't been published?

26:52.184 --> 26:52.886
I'm curious.

26:52.946 --> 26:57.577
This whole concept of book culture and reading culture is of great interest to me.

26:57.597 --> 27:02.650
Well, the title refers to Talany, which was a sort of underground...

27:02.630 --> 27:12.143
semi-pornographic but very great 19th century novel written by several people, one of whom may have been Oscar Wilde.

27:12.343 --> 27:20.153
Before it was eventually published in Paris, it existed in the form of a manuscript that was passed from hand to hand.

27:20.173 --> 27:20.554
Really?

27:20.594 --> 27:21.375
How do you spell it?

27:22.276 --> 27:24.319
Telany, T-E-L-E-N-Y.

27:24.339 --> 27:25.680
And is there literature on it?

27:26.321 --> 27:27.623
Yeah, it's available now.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.646
But I mean, is there literature on the history of it?

27:30.387 --> 27:30.747
There's

27:31.098 --> 27:32.359
Some people have written about it.

27:33.140 --> 27:37.525
There's a good introduction to the British edition that tells the entire history of it.

27:38.527 --> 27:42.912
And we've written a fairly detailed history of it in the anthology.

27:42.932 --> 27:44.253
And when will this be published?

27:44.333 --> 27:45.174
In the fall.

27:45.194 --> 27:45.635
By whom?

27:45.655 --> 27:46.236
Hoden Mifflin.

27:46.256 --> 27:47.837
Oh, good, good, good, good.

27:47.858 --> 27:58.590
But to research this book, especially the English material, we spent about two weeks at the British Library in that reading room, reading all sorts of weird, old, for example, public schoolboy novels.

27:59.532 --> 28:00.954
Things like that.

28:02.355 --> 28:03.096
And I loved it.

28:03.136 --> 28:04.838
I developed such a fondness for that place.

28:04.919 --> 28:06.601
Yeah, it's a wonderful place.

28:07.662 --> 28:09.384
Let's see, what else did I want to ask you?

28:09.404 --> 28:14.190
Oh, your mind jumps around here.

28:14.210 --> 28:15.692
I mean, I think I have this pretty clear.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.395
Okay.

28:18.415 --> 28:22.620
There was another question, but you can't...

28:23.782 --> 28:27.852
Of course, it'll come to me just as soon as I have.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.777
When are you coming up here?

28:30.318 --> 28:31.421
On the day after tomorrow.

28:31.441 --> 28:33.506
Yeah, I have to go to Washington, unfortunately.

28:33.526 --> 28:35.270
I would much rather do this in person.

28:36.934 --> 28:39.681
I told Laurie I really did want to talk to you, so...

28:39.661 --> 28:44.626
I have to say, I really prefer the personal interview to the telephone interview.

28:44.706 --> 28:45.567
I do too.

28:47.168 --> 28:50.492
But this, I did want to do the story, and we'll get it up pretty quickly.

28:50.752 --> 28:54.195
You're going to be around at all today, if I want to call back?

28:54.316 --> 28:58.380
Yeah, I'll be from sort of 2 until about 6.

28:58.540 --> 29:02.083
I'm going to be here part of the time on the phone, part of the time doing a print interview.

29:02.323 --> 29:02.724
Okay.

29:02.924 --> 29:03.925
So yeah, if you call back.

29:04.245 --> 29:04.686
Okay, good.

29:04.706 --> 29:06.147
I think we're fine.

29:06.868 --> 29:06.968
Okay.

29:07.403 --> 29:09.846
I know there was another question.

29:09.866 --> 29:12.229
Not necessarily burning, but pretty interesting.

29:12.349 --> 29:14.893
And, of course, it escapes me right now.

29:14.913 --> 29:18.677
But I enjoyed talking with you again and look forward to the next time.

29:18.697 --> 29:19.699
Oh, yeah, here's the question.

29:19.719 --> 29:21.781
I mean, you're now, what, 35?

29:21.821 --> 29:26.948
So tell me, were you happy with the arc of your career up there?

29:26.928 --> 29:39.944
If you could just briefly talk about the arc of your career as a literary career, where it was going, and then the ramifications and the consequences of that whole Spender incident.

29:40.224 --> 29:43.949
Well, I still don't know, because I think time will tell.

29:44.069 --> 29:49.816
I mean, I don't think it's had long-lasting ramifications.

29:51.258 --> 29:55.483
And I'm very glad that the book is going to be published in England finally.

29:56.425 --> 29:57.306
in the fall.

29:57.626 --> 29:59.688
And obviously in the revised?

30:00.088 --> 30:01.830
Yes, and not by Penguin.

30:01.870 --> 30:04.752
I've changed publishers there.

30:05.753 --> 30:14.781
However, you know, when I look back, I often feel that I would, from a commercial standpoint, I benefited very much from publishing as early as I did.

30:14.821 --> 30:16.863
From an artistic standpoint, I'm not sure if I did.

30:17.924 --> 30:26.331
I think that I probably became a little bit arrogant after my first book

30:26.969 --> 30:33.356
in the way that here I was being lauded as a serious writer, as a very young man.

30:34.137 --> 30:41.986
And at a point when what I needed to do was go through a period of very slow development, I was being urged to publish more.

30:42.927 --> 30:49.134
And so when I look back, I'm sometimes a little embarrassed by some of the things that I wrote between Family Dancing and Willing and Sleeps.

30:50.335 --> 30:54.360
And I often wish that I'd had

30:55.015 --> 30:56.880
a more conventional career.

30:56.900 --> 31:06.844
I mean, for example, I just read Edmund White's new book, The Farewell Symphony, and at one point he says about the five novels that he wrote and never published, how relieved he is now that he never published them.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.134
Do you have any stuff on the desk drawer?

31:11.587 --> 31:13.009
Sure.

31:13.129 --> 31:14.091
Gathering dust.

31:14.111 --> 31:18.537
For example, Houghton Mifflin is going to bring in a new paperback edition of The Lost Language of Cranes.

31:18.577 --> 31:22.663
And as I was reading it over, I just winced with embarrassment at some of the things I'd done.

31:23.204 --> 31:24.726
Were you tempted at all to change it?

31:24.987 --> 31:25.928
I am going to.

31:26.249 --> 31:26.709
Oh, you are?

31:26.729 --> 31:28.532
I'm not going to change anything huge.

31:28.985 --> 31:32.589
But I'm doing some tightening and editing.

31:32.609 --> 31:44.523
Well, that's very interesting because so many authors I've talked to, I mean, there really is an attitude about completed work being regarded as completed work and representing, you know, again, it goes back to the arc of your career.

31:44.583 --> 31:53.593
And I'm wondering, you know, if maybe even though it makes you wince today at 35, maybe that does represent who you were as a writer, you know, when you were 28 or so.

31:53.773 --> 31:55.195
It's the only book I do it with, though.

31:55.732 --> 32:00.278
Because I think it's not that I want to change anything substantive.

32:00.298 --> 32:01.499
I just found it sloppy.

32:02.901 --> 32:06.085
Do you have a sense of neatness here, then, that you wanted to?

32:06.145 --> 32:07.426
I wanted it to read better.

32:08.568 --> 32:21.624
You know, there were some very embarrassing, at one point, some terrible problems with, for example, redundancies, such as referring to a plastic Tupperware container.

32:22.986 --> 32:24.928
You know, that kind of thing, which seems so...

32:25.297 --> 32:27.741
Well, if you make it Tupperware, make it plastic, right?

32:27.761 --> 32:28.061
Exactly.

32:28.422 --> 32:30.525
And that's the level of the kinds of things I'm changing.

32:30.645 --> 32:32.448
But when I read those things now, I just win.

32:34.571 --> 32:34.911
Hmm.

32:34.931 --> 32:35.232
Okay.

32:35.492 --> 32:37.014
That's not revision.

32:37.074 --> 32:42.883
But I did an interview with Tim O'Brien when the Lake of the Woods came out.

32:43.505 --> 32:53.819
He made this unbelievable assertion that when the paperback of Cacciato came out, he really did considerable rewriting of it without telling anybody.

32:54.400 --> 33:02.290
And then he got a letter from a professor someplace who said he was reading the book from his hardcover and his students were reading it from the...

33:02.540 --> 33:05.787
from the paperback, and they said, Jesus, this is different here.

33:06.509 --> 33:08.253
And I said, well, you know, why?

33:08.313 --> 33:11.159
That was a National Book Award winning novel.

33:11.259 --> 33:11.961
Why change it?

33:11.981 --> 33:13.665
And that's you 20 years ago.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.110
And he said, well, I have this obligation to make this

33:16.597 --> 33:19.862
beautiful piece of work, you know, make it as beautiful as I can.

33:19.942 --> 33:20.884
And that's one attitude.

33:20.944 --> 33:23.608
Henry James certainly had that attitude too, didn't he?

33:23.689 --> 33:24.590
Yes, he certainly did.

33:25.652 --> 33:26.673
With mixed results.

33:27.294 --> 33:29.037
I think decidedly mixed results.

33:29.698 --> 33:35.568
The prefaces to the New York edition are wonderful, but I don't know if the changes he made in the novels, you know, made them better.

33:35.728 --> 33:37.010
No, I tend to prefer the earlier.

33:37.050 --> 33:37.491
Yeah.

33:37.910 --> 33:40.115
But anyway, listen, I'll let you go.

33:40.155 --> 33:41.959
That was good.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.965
That was kind of what I wanted to discuss.

33:45.446 --> 33:46.208
Well, thanks very much.

33:46.228 --> 33:46.869
And I think you did.

33:46.889 --> 33:48.493
And I look forward to it.

33:48.974 --> 33:50.417
Do you mind one other quick question?

33:51.072 --> 34:02.947
When you first, you know, and again, I haven't even brought it up because it hasn't occurred to me, but, you know, you were identified as, you know, this quote-unquote gay fiction writer.

34:04.128 --> 34:06.371
I think that bothers you.

34:06.511 --> 34:07.532
That would be my sense.

34:07.753 --> 34:19.307
It bothers me less now than it used to, but I'm willing to accept it since I don't have much choice, but I want it to be made clear that I'm a writer first and gay second.

34:21.380 --> 34:22.161
Okay.

34:22.481 --> 34:32.153
And that, you know, anyone who enjoys reading, you would hope and you would expect, you know, that they will read the books for the pleasure of the literature.

34:32.734 --> 34:35.718
I wish that the language would allow me to call myself a writer gay.

34:36.979 --> 34:37.860
Who even needs that?

34:38.121 --> 34:39.382
Exactly.

34:39.402 --> 34:44.248
But no, I mean, as long as it's clear that my commitment primarily is to writing.

34:45.038 --> 34:48.263
And also I think the classification of what is gay fiction, you know?

34:48.583 --> 34:52.449
I mean, that makes it a genre itself, doesn't it?

34:53.231 --> 34:54.372
Well, unfortunately.

34:54.793 --> 34:59.300
But I think that that's more the result of publishing than anything else.

35:00.021 --> 35:02.625
The fact that publishers have discovered a kind of

35:03.112 --> 35:14.194
easy way to market books by selling them only at gay bookstores and advertising them only in gay publications, as if the books, because of gay subject matter, automatically are of no interest to anyone else.

35:14.775 --> 35:20.867
Just think if you'd had some of these UCLA students narrating that novella, they'd market it as young adults, probably.

35:21.708 --> 35:24.933
Maybe that's the next thing is I should rewrite the whole thing from the point of view.

35:24.953 --> 35:31.603
Well, I mean, it is said that if Catcher in the Rye would be issued today, it would be issued as a young adult novel.

35:31.623 --> 35:32.324
Isn't that incredible?

35:32.604 --> 35:35.769
Because the narrator is a kid, you know?

35:35.789 --> 35:36.951
And that's publishing today.

35:36.991 --> 35:38.493
That's publishing.

35:38.513 --> 35:39.134
Okay, sir.

35:39.495 --> 35:40.035
You take care.

35:40.076 --> 35:40.436
Thank you.

35:40.456 --> 35:41.558
Nice talking to you.

35:41.598 --> 35:41.758
Bye-bye.
