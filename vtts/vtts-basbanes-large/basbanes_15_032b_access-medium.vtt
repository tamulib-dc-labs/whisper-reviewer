WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:05.446
Okay, sir, we're on again.

00:05.466 --> 00:14.775
How often, to be irrelevant for a moment, how often do you encounter a person you're interviewing who also has his own recorder, of what he's saying?

00:14.795 --> 00:15.396
Not often.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.277
Do you have one?

00:16.297 --> 00:16.737
No, I don't.

00:16.837 --> 00:18.980
No, that's good.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.650
I never have, but I have noticed—well, I'll tell you, my colleague at Harvard Law School, Alan Dershowitz, apparently, whenever he speaks, carries his own

00:30.355 --> 00:32.458
I can't blame him, actually.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.382
No, no, I didn't mean to.

00:35.643 --> 00:37.225
If he's been burned in the past.

00:37.886 --> 00:45.497
I don't know whether he has been burned, or sometimes, of course, he's preserving things that wouldn't otherwise be recorded.

00:46.539 --> 00:48.341
And it may, I suspect.

00:50.465 --> 00:57.595
I have often wished that I could reconstruct the way I put something

00:59.009 --> 01:08.359
in class, or to you, or, gee, I said that much better this morning, and it never will come back, you know what I mean?

01:08.379 --> 01:11.883
That, I suspect, that's all he's doing, but it just flashed through my mind.

01:11.923 --> 01:28.560
Well, in my experience, it's happened one or two times, particularly, I think, with people involved to some degree in the political process, where it would behoove them to have a record of what they said

01:29.080 --> 01:31.163
Right.

01:31.183 --> 01:32.205
And it would make sense.

01:32.225 --> 01:37.272
But in terms of interviewing authors, per se, none of them have ever done it.

01:37.292 --> 01:37.412
Right.

01:37.432 --> 01:37.813
Question.

01:38.053 --> 01:44.823
I know that you have gone on record as saying you will not go on record regarding the Bork nomination.

01:45.504 --> 01:45.805
Right.

01:47.287 --> 01:56.841
Could you tell me, for the record, why would you give me a statement?

01:56.881 --> 01:56.961
Yes.

01:58.325 --> 02:25.598
an application of the principle that one shouldn't involve himself, where there may be a conflict between irrelevant personal feelings in this interest and the exercise of the impartial judgment

02:27.063 --> 02:53.391
Not even I can tell for sure, having been fired by Bork in the sense that he was the instrument, how far any personal feeling

02:55.210 --> 02:58.494
might be influencing my judgment.

02:58.514 --> 03:03.080
If it was against him, how far it was being influenced in that direction.

03:03.641 --> 03:10.950
If it was foreign, how far it was the result of leaning over backwards and not wanting to be unfair.

03:12.592 --> 03:19.200
And I don't think any man can be sure that he has struck the right balance.

03:20.221 --> 03:22.264
And I think every man also

03:24.590 --> 03:32.102
be aware that even if by some miracle he did strike the right balance, nobody else would think he had struck the right balance.

03:32.142 --> 03:35.167
So, better to withdraw from the debate entirely?

03:35.187 --> 03:51.272
Yes, it's—I mean, the clearer cases, of course, are where one should stand aside from acting on a public question.

03:52.282 --> 04:08.882
But I think much the same thing is involved when it comes to expressing an opinion which might have some influence, and might have some influence for the very reason that you shouldn't be expressing an opinion.

04:08.902 --> 04:20.095
Perhaps you might wish to comment on the process, though, that he is currently going through, whereby he is acknowledged to have excellent credentials

04:20.935 --> 04:26.362
and yet there is a groundswell of opposition to his confirmation.

04:27.043 --> 04:41.701
Well, that's, again, a fair question, but any comment on the process gets so close to the particular case and the person and the individual that I think I'm better now.

04:41.741 --> 04:41.982
Okay.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.305
Another topical question.

04:44.365 --> 04:50.132
How do you feel about the propriety of Justice Thurgood Marshall just a few days ago?

04:50.905 --> 04:55.211
commenting on the politics of President Reagan?

04:55.231 --> 05:19.022
I think all the justices would be much better advised if they would return to the older practice, virtually a tradition, of refraining from comment on current public issues or current public officials or

05:19.407 --> 05:24.294
perhaps more broadly, current public figures.

05:26.617 --> 05:41.998
Maybe there have been exceptions in the period from the Civil War to 1960 or thereabouts.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.723
I don't know of them.

05:45.743 --> 05:49.228
The practice certainly came to be in true

05:49.799 --> 05:59.929
All but the last few years of my life, the justices didn't do that, period.

05:59.949 --> 06:01.670
You mentioned Justice Marshall.

06:01.690 --> 06:07.476
There's also Justice Stevens' comment on the board, nomination.

06:08.617 --> 06:19.367
I think the justices would do better to define their talking to their judicial opinion.

06:21.524 --> 06:43.874
Regarding the Constitution itself, this document, which evolved apparently over a four-month period, of course the evolution wasn't greater than that, but the actual framing, you might just reflect on the inspiration.

06:43.974 --> 06:49.742
Was it an inspired process to have such...

06:49.975 --> 06:53.880
that two centuries' worth of significance.

06:55.322 --> 07:18.750
Well, it was the product of years of study and reflection of men who were both practical

07:19.540 --> 07:38.397
the affairs of their day, had local office and things like that, but who also had read nearly everything written about government and governments in the past and studied their history.

07:38.417 --> 07:47.725
And I think the single most extraordinary thing about the dominant framers of the

07:48.886 --> 08:11.777
was their sense of the long-run implications of the way you establish institutions of government through the interplay between those institutions and human behavior, the springs of human action.

08:12.699 --> 08:18.066
I mean, they thought in these terms and talked in these terms.

08:18.299 --> 08:20.421
They were concerned for the long run.

08:21.182 --> 08:27.548
But they also were very conscious of the immediate political needs of their times.

08:27.709 --> 08:44.185
Now, the other thing that, of course, in a sense, perhaps comes closer to inspiration, in the end, as you know, during those four months, it teetered on the balance.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.749
Early July, they just about all went home.

08:48.303 --> 08:52.529
almost like the collective bargaining session.

08:53.551 --> 08:55.053
Well, we'll meet again tonight.

08:55.374 --> 08:57.357
It doesn't look to be much use.

08:57.777 --> 09:01.142
If it doesn't come off tonight, then we'll break up.

09:03.666 --> 09:14.162
I think the sense we must achieve a result, we must achieve some unity, was inspiration almost.

09:14.643 --> 09:16.926
Do you think that these 18th century men

09:17.446 --> 09:26.274
would be amazed to learn that their 18th century sensibilities still govern people in the 20th century.

09:28.055 --> 09:40.446
I think you kind of touch on that in the book, where you say they probably had no idea that the Constitution, as framed, would continue to be a viable product 200 years later.

09:40.626 --> 09:42.648
I think that's true.

09:43.629 --> 09:46.491
Of course, we know

09:46.910 --> 09:58.764
Some men of that time, he wasn't in the convention, but Jefferson said on various occasions that the Constitution ought to be changed every ten years.

09:59.544 --> 10:02.488
I certainly didn't think it was as enduring.

10:02.988 --> 10:15.803
No, one of the things that in the bicentennial year my mind keeps coming back to, you'll remember that George Washington wrote Lafayette shortly after the signing

10:16.238 --> 10:19.421
of the Constitution.

10:20.022 --> 10:21.624
It was a miracle.

10:24.967 --> 10:34.417
I think it's an even greater miracle, that with few major changes through the addition of the Bill of Rights.

10:34.477 --> 10:37.260
But that was done by the same men, essentially.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.561
Several years later.

10:38.701 --> 10:42.165
Yes, four years later, and not identical men.

10:42.205 --> 10:46.009
But Madison was on both, and so were a lot of others.

10:46.462 --> 10:48.764
And then, the post-Civil War amendments.

10:50.406 --> 10:59.354
With those major additions, it's the same document, the same instrument.

10:59.914 --> 11:11.625
And isn't it an even greater miracle that that same instrument, with those changes, still is such a workable structure of government today.

11:12.666 --> 11:15.388
That serves as a low stock.

11:16.516 --> 11:19.940
for Americans in so many contexts.

11:21.241 --> 11:24.424
You ask, why that second miracle?

11:26.246 --> 11:44.565
Well, I think part of it was what I call this sense of the framers, the interplay between institutions and human nature in the long run, which second

11:47.347 --> 11:53.736
I attribute a great deal of it to the work of the Supreme Court.

11:58.903 --> 12:15.767
It occurred to me that somebody might say, well, isn't it curious, Professor, that you should attribute so much to the role of court, which isn't even spelled out in the Constitution?

12:16.945 --> 12:27.742
And then the third is, I think, the character of the American people.

12:27.762 --> 12:35.655
The extraordinary sense, through most of our history, of being engaged in a great common adventure.

12:36.696 --> 12:44.809
The sense of motion, an adventure not just of

12:45.177 --> 12:49.884
all the people, excluding the blacks at first, but now bringing them into it.

12:51.707 --> 12:59.839
But also a sense of an adventure that was common to previous generations and future generations.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.662
You have a wonderful line in the book.

13:01.922 --> 13:05.067
They also had a sense of giving us enough, but not too much.

13:05.468 --> 13:06.529
Yes, yes.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.933
Saying enough, but not too much.

13:08.953 --> 13:10.936
Yes, very important.

13:10.956 --> 13:11.257
Yes.

13:11.918 --> 13:14.121
And then one other thing which I really like is that

13:14.405 --> 13:21.994
You said that it's amazing how the most trivial cases can decide the most fundamental issues.

13:22.014 --> 13:23.456
Yes, yes.

13:23.476 --> 13:26.259
Has that always surprised you as a student of the law?

13:29.603 --> 13:32.567
Well, certainly often.

13:34.930 --> 13:39.435
Certainly often, and about Marbury and Madison, yes, for many years.

13:42.098 --> 13:43.720
I did do.

13:43.970 --> 14:04.898
connection with the book that projected television series, I did get deeper into the facts that people made for these cases and the events that led up to them that I ever had before.

14:04.918 --> 14:06.601
They're wonderful cases, by the way.

14:07.542 --> 14:11.307
I found that fascinating.

14:11.988 --> 14:13.470
I've practiced law enough.

14:14.547 --> 14:24.339
Now, cases do arise out of very individual human needs.

14:24.479 --> 14:29.665
They become important because there are a lot of other human beings who have the same feelings.

14:30.927 --> 14:42.040
And or, as John W. Davis used to put it, appellate cases are one on the facts and not on the law.

14:43.100 --> 14:53.957
I was not unaware of this, but I found it great fun pursuing it, and it intensified my appreciation of those truths.

14:54.859 --> 14:57.082
Well, we've got this schedule.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.685
I'd be delighted to talk more.

14:58.705 --> 15:02.391
Would you kindly give me the honors?
