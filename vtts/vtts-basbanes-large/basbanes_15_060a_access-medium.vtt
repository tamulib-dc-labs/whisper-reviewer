00:01.786 --> 00:02.807
talk about your book.

00:03.929 --> 00:04.069
Hi.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.871
We're talking with Kathleen.

00:05.951 --> 00:09.196
It's first time I think I've seen Kathleen with a C. Is that unusual?

00:10.117 --> 00:13.642
Yes, it's an old Jewish name that runs in the family.

00:14.623 --> 00:17.226
I don't know where my parents came up with it, but I like it.

00:17.286 --> 00:18.007
It's very nice.

00:20.110 --> 00:25.397
Tell me about, where is Pequotter in your mind?

00:25.613 --> 00:35.587
I decided, partly because of the mistake I made in the last book, that I wanted this town to be completely imaginary, made up.

00:36.608 --> 00:43.278
Partly it was so I could use it as a character, really make it a character in the book.

00:44.139 --> 00:52.231
And partly I didn't want to make mistakes, put the wrong kind of flora and fauna in it and have the street names wrong.

00:52.351 --> 00:54.093
I just didn't want to have to think about that.

00:54.153 --> 00:55.435
I wanted to just create it.

00:55.837 --> 01:05.868
So the name Pequot is an Indian name from New England, right, and in Connecticut also, which is where I'm from.

01:06.169 --> 01:07.370
I'm from Westport, Connecticut.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.291
Really?

01:08.411 --> 01:09.152
Yes.

01:11.054 --> 01:15.940
I have two papers in Connecticut that take my feature, New London, Tennessee, and Manchester.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.102
We'll mention that.

01:19.044 --> 01:19.404
Okay.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.546
They always like that.

01:21.566 --> 01:21.927
That's right.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.248
Local girl makes good.

01:23.268 --> 01:24.730
Local angle.

01:25.688 --> 01:40.564
So I used the name, which I really like, and I wanted to give it a kind of New England feel, but I wanted it to be possibly Massachusetts, possibly Cape Cod, possibly Connecticut.

01:40.684 --> 01:44.268
It's a little bit physically, a little bit like Stonington, Connecticut.

01:46.070 --> 01:49.053
It could possibly be on Long Island.

01:50.714 --> 01:51.736
Possibly on Long Island, yeah.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.058
And it could also possibly be...

01:54.410 --> 02:02.222
The Jersey Shore, one of the reference books that I used, I went to the Strand, this wonderful bookstore.

02:03.423 --> 02:03.744
Great bookstore.

02:03.764 --> 02:05.406
Yes.

02:06.248 --> 02:12.617
And I just poked around in the local history, and I found a book with the best title of any book I've ever seen.

02:12.637 --> 02:15.341
And I'll try to get it right.

02:15.401 --> 02:19.928
It was not Towns of New Jersey...

02:20.667 --> 02:23.672
Not small towns of New Jersey.

02:23.773 --> 02:25.375
Yeah, it was not any of these.

02:25.696 --> 02:28.922
It was not small towns of southern New Jersey.

02:29.743 --> 02:33.610
It was not forgotten small towns of southern New Jersey.

02:34.171 --> 02:39.300
It was more forgotten small towns of southern New Jersey.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.812
My favorite title.

02:40.832 --> 02:41.834
This was at the Strand?

02:41.954 --> 02:42.575
Yeah, it was.

02:42.775 --> 02:44.759
So the first one must have been a smash hit.

02:44.779 --> 02:45.460
Yeah, right.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.722
That's what I thought.

02:46.802 --> 02:47.644
Here's the sequel.

02:47.804 --> 02:52.131
More Forgotten Small Towns of Southern New Jersey.

02:52.151 --> 02:52.411
That's great.

02:52.431 --> 02:53.213
There was Pequod.

02:53.654 --> 02:54.154
It was great.

02:54.194 --> 03:03.550
Well, there wasn't a Pequod, actually, but I just used all these different stories from, because there's a lot of little bits of local history in the book, and

03:04.340 --> 03:09.390
And a lot of the names I got, the name Scattergoods was a real name of some people.

03:09.831 --> 03:11.534
You got me on Scattergoods, by the way.

03:11.955 --> 03:13.979
I'm usually pretty good at figuring these things out.

03:14.059 --> 03:19.289
That came from, it was some family that settled a town in southern New Jersey.

03:19.309 --> 03:20.972
But I also mean the resolution of the story.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.315
Oh, oh, oh, I got you.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.697
Good, good, good.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.162
That's very good.

03:26.598 --> 03:32.226
When I first wrote it, someone said, why don't you just put up a big poster saying what's going to happen?

03:32.266 --> 03:34.128
But I fixed it and made it less obvious.

03:34.148 --> 03:34.869
No, I didn't see that.

03:35.070 --> 03:35.751
No, I fixed it.

03:35.811 --> 03:39.956
It was very obvious when I first wrote it, and I like it the way it is now.

03:42.360 --> 03:49.309
So anyway, that's what... I wanted it to have... Basically, that town is a summer town.

03:50.010 --> 03:52.774
I think anyone who's ever...

03:53.075 --> 03:59.624
been in New England and been to a town on the water in the summer will instantly recognize it, even though it's not real.

04:00.064 --> 04:04.370
And so is it kind of like a Shakespearean comedy in that respect?

04:04.390 --> 04:10.839
I mean, it is a summery kind of a... Yeah, I mean, I hadn't... ...like quality to it, I guess?

04:10.859 --> 04:22.575
I hadn't thought of Shakespeare, and I would never even, you know, make that comparison, but... The only reason it comes to mind is I'm just writing about Jane Smiley's book this week.

04:22.859 --> 04:26.165
Which is very definitely almost like a Shakespearean comedy.

04:26.185 --> 04:26.686
The new one?

04:27.167 --> 04:27.427
Moo?

04:27.527 --> 04:28.569
I love Moo.

04:28.890 --> 04:30.032
Oh, I think it's brilliant.

04:30.292 --> 04:32.997
How could she go from that previous book to this one?

04:33.017 --> 04:33.899
She's incredible.

04:33.939 --> 04:35.502
She really is.

04:35.682 --> 04:39.829
That book, I'm going to write about it also, if I can find the time.

04:39.849 --> 04:42.915
Because I just loved it.

04:42.975 --> 04:43.656
It's brilliant.

04:43.756 --> 04:44.698
And if you write...

04:44.864 --> 04:51.615
If you write humorous novels, you see just, you know, it's a great work of art.

04:51.635 --> 04:54.459
I mean, it's so difficult what she did, and she made it look so easy.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.584
And then I went back and read A Thousand Acres, which I've never read.

04:58.005 --> 04:59.307
It's completely different.

04:59.848 --> 05:01.851
Completely different skills involved.

05:01.891 --> 05:02.572
It's amazing.

05:02.612 --> 05:03.514
She's amazing.

05:03.534 --> 05:10.164
Yeah, my piece, we don't have to talk about her, but it's three novels in a row, and then Greenlanders was like an epic.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.226
It was a historical...

05:11.493 --> 05:12.835
Is that good?

05:12.875 --> 05:13.576
I haven't read that.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.459
Yeah, that was just Greenlanders, it's called.

05:15.479 --> 05:16.040
It's an epic.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.285
I mean, it's a historical epic set, you know, a thousand years ago.

05:19.305 --> 05:20.506
Oh, did you like it?

05:21.628 --> 05:23.451
No, I like these two better, but that's beside the point.

05:23.471 --> 05:24.352
Well, maybe I'll try and read it.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.779
But my point was with her, I said, do I sense something here?

05:28.899 --> 05:31.382
You know, Shakespeare was a blear, it was a tragedy.

05:31.803 --> 05:33.425
Here's the history, here's the comedy.

05:34.147 --> 05:37.872
She said, not bad, you know, but she does see these two as a pair.

05:38.054 --> 05:42.541
There's agriculture in Iowa.

05:42.581 --> 05:46.307
Well, it's the two sides.

05:46.868 --> 06:06.238
Anyway, I hadn't thought of that, but some reviewers said something about Midsummer Night's Dream and about Puck and about a love potion, and I thought how wonderful, because in fact the love letter does function as a kind of love potion in a

06:06.590 --> 06:15.346
Now that you've mentioned love letters didn't really work in Shakespeare, was it much do about nothing, or were it all love letters?

06:16.208 --> 06:17.150
You got me.

06:17.250 --> 06:23.041
I didn't sit in on all of the Shakespeare courses with my husband.

06:23.061 --> 06:29.593
I sat in on the Lear.

06:30.265 --> 06:42.123
With my last book, what I was thinking of very specifically were movies like The Awful Truth and those kind of romantic farce comedies.

06:42.163 --> 06:50.215
With this one, I really wanted to write a more conventional novel with a beginning, a middle, an end.

06:50.600 --> 06:57.145
that was less of a farce and was really a romance, but one that, I mean, I like reading.

06:57.326 --> 07:00.849
But you worked in a little mystery element to it.

07:02.030 --> 07:20.505
Yeah, because it seems to me that most of the time when you think about a plot and that there's a real relation, that what mysteries do, and maybe the reason they're so satisfying, is they kind of boil down the essence of narrative, which is what's going to happen and who did it, who did what.

07:20.890 --> 07:24.133
And so I played around with that.

07:24.173 --> 07:25.395
That was fun also.

07:25.675 --> 07:32.181
I mean, this book, although it's smaller and in some ways lighter than the last book, it was much more complicated to write.

07:32.201 --> 07:40.630
And let's talk a bit about using the bookstore and this passion for words and things.

07:41.731 --> 07:47.657
Well, the bookstore seemed like a really rich environment.

07:48.228 --> 08:04.246
I spend a lot of time in bookstores, and I browse, and I buy, and I think that there's something very personal about one's relationship to a small bookstore.

08:04.286 --> 08:18.201
Even if you've just come in for the first time, it's as if you're meeting someone, because the taste of the owner is apparent, and you strike up a relationship right away with that store.

08:18.637 --> 08:20.039
And that interested me.

08:20.159 --> 08:32.873
And also, I had a friend who had been the manager of a small store in New York called Three Lives, and she was always telling me these stories of all these things that had happened there, and everybody was flirting with everybody else.

08:32.953 --> 08:43.765
And I thought, what a wonderful little hothouse with lots of people, or for me, with lots of characters walking in off the street.

08:44.146 --> 08:48.070
There was just a tremendous amount of possibility there.

08:48.623 --> 08:54.911
And plus I got to write about books and to mention books, and, you know, I like them.

08:54.931 --> 09:00.779
Well, you mentioned the Wilson-Bolkoff letters, which I have and which I enjoy, and Elizabeth Bishop's letters from last year.

09:00.859 --> 09:03.122
Elizabeth Bishop's letters were amazing.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.966
Really, one of the great collections.

09:05.986 --> 09:10.873
Yeah, and very moving when you think about her life and compared to the poetry.

09:10.893 --> 09:11.734
I mean, they're very different.

09:11.774 --> 09:16.200
I found them very interesting, because then I started thinking about what letters are.

09:16.636 --> 09:21.706
and especially if you don't write letters, which I don't, but I like getting them.

09:21.726 --> 09:23.570
Now, when did you start thinking about letters?

09:23.590 --> 09:26.536
Well, once I... Okay, well, here's what happened.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.981
I thought, oh, good, a bookstore.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.244
I'm going to put it in a bookstore.

09:31.185 --> 09:32.588
So we started with the place first?

09:32.829 --> 09:33.430
We did.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.654
And I thought, oh, good.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.037
Do we have Helen at this point?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.324
Well, we had someone who was a flirt.

09:41.105 --> 09:42.187
Yes, we had Helen.

09:42.207 --> 09:42.848
A 40-ish flirt?

09:43.069 --> 09:44.652
A 40-ish flirt.

09:44.752 --> 09:48.540
I hadn't decided with whom she was going to fall in love.

09:48.700 --> 09:54.912
I knew I wanted a very particular kind of short, you know, a kind of

09:55.347 --> 09:59.632
Every 20-year-old kid's dream, I have to tell you.

09:59.652 --> 10:00.092
Good.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.335
It's a perfect summer.

10:02.355 --> 10:06.159
Well, every 42-year-old woman's dream as well, I imagine.

10:06.820 --> 10:18.492
I really wanted the kind of love and romance that is very powerful even as you realize how ridiculous it is.

10:18.512 --> 10:22.637
I mean, that's what was important to me, that it shouldn't be someone

10:23.056 --> 10:25.519
with whom she could have a life.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.865
I mean, you could, I suppose, but it would be rather difficult.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.849
So it does really have to be summer.

10:33.110 --> 10:38.157
It has to be a place like Cape Cod or wherever.

10:38.177 --> 10:38.457
Right.

10:38.978 --> 10:41.321
It's a fable, I mean, in a way.

10:41.962 --> 10:46.969
And in September we're all going to wake up, maybe.

10:46.989 --> 10:52.236
But I think what Helen wakes up to in September, because she does wake up in September,

10:52.621 --> 11:05.058
But what she wakes up to is her own vulnerability, which is something she didn't want to think about in the past, and how important that is and how that's one of the things that makes us human.

11:05.398 --> 11:09.704
I mean, that's one of the good things, to be that vulnerable to feeling and to emotion.

11:10.505 --> 11:19.658
And so I think in a way she discovers a weakness, but I think that she realizes that that weakness is one of the great

11:20.009 --> 11:27.719
joys, that it's a privilege to get to feel that particular weakness.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.967
That was the thing I was really trying to get at.

11:34.668 --> 11:47.265
It's not so easy in this society to come up with a pair who would have to keep something secret, because not too much is taboo anymore.

11:47.718 --> 11:52.097
But I think this pretty much counts.

11:52.137 --> 11:52.981
This qualifies.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.814
Especially in a village where she is a known person.

11:56.115 --> 11:56.597
Right.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.794
Right, she's a respectable person with a child.

11:59.914 --> 12:01.135
She knows the parents of this.

12:01.155 --> 12:04.439
Right, it's a little outré.

12:04.559 --> 12:06.562
I mean, there is some baggage to this.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.683
Right, exactly.

12:07.863 --> 12:24.403
And that adds to the sense of ridiculousness and of absurdity, and also that it's wrong in the eyes of most of the world, and yet she and Johnny both feel that it's right.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.145
Did he have to be Johnny, by the way?

12:26.665 --> 12:53.871
My editor, whose name was John, when I started this, and now my editor's, he left, and so I have another, Janet is my editor, but he said, Janet, Janet Silver, he said, Johnny, it has to be Johnny, I hate the name Johnny, because it's horrible, no 20-year-old would allow himself to be called Johnny.

12:54.307 --> 12:59.312
And I thought, well, that's true, but that's part of what's going on here.

12:59.432 --> 13:07.961
And that's part of, you know, she thinks she has a certain hold over him because she's older and she's his boss and she's bossy and very confident.

13:07.981 --> 13:10.223
Well, she barks at him like he's a dog at this point.

13:10.243 --> 13:10.343
Yeah.

13:10.363 --> 13:11.665
And she knows she's barking at him.

13:11.685 --> 13:14.848
Yeah, she barks and he knows that she's barking at him, you know.

13:14.868 --> 13:19.993
I mean, at one point he feels as if he's the dog on the leash.

13:20.750 --> 13:27.800
And that was part of what made the whole thing ridiculous, and yet there was nothing either of them really could do.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.063
These were very strong and very real feelings.

13:30.083 --> 13:34.209
I mean, things can be real at the same time that they're preposterous.

13:34.490 --> 13:37.895
And that combination, I think, is very powerful.

13:38.135 --> 13:50.132
And I've always loved to write comedy about things that are preposterous, but I also at the same time wanted to write about this very earnest, powerful, real...

13:50.551 --> 13:51.092
feeling.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.297
So that was kind of the fun of doing both those things.

13:56.499 --> 13:59.363
You say, in your books, are they all comic novels?

13:59.383 --> 14:00.845
Yeah, they're all comic.

14:00.865 --> 14:04.990
And the first two are farces.

14:05.010 --> 14:11.319
The first one was about a girl in the hospital, which is very autobiographical, and it's really a farce.

14:11.339 --> 14:12.901
It's sort of a black farce.

14:13.722 --> 14:19.950
And the second one is about the same family, and there's a stalker, and

14:20.318 --> 14:22.542
But they're very much comic.

14:23.544 --> 14:38.913
And then the last one is a little more complicated and is sort of what I consider an intellectual farce, a comedy of... That one's still in print and paperback.

14:39.013 --> 14:42.580
Yeah, I think with your passion for books, you'd like it.

14:43.302 --> 14:52.672
So that one, it was sort of instead of people slamming doors and going in and out off the stage, that one was really more ideas slamming doors.

14:52.752 --> 14:53.856
Now, is this a satire?

14:54.859 --> 14:55.301
This one?

14:55.521 --> 14:55.742
No.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.079
Because one of your reviewers said they called it a satire.

14:59.639 --> 15:03.423
I found that very interesting, and someone said I skewered characters.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.044
I was looking for the satire element.

15:05.405 --> 15:11.351
I don't write satires, and I think that sometimes people just use the satire word when they mean comedy.

15:11.371 --> 15:14.213
You have to satirize something.

15:14.313 --> 15:24.143
You have to satirize something, and I sometimes comment on things or describe them in a funny way, but I think satire requires a certain...

15:24.545 --> 15:27.869
real anger about a target.

15:27.889 --> 15:29.030
You really have to have a target.

15:29.130 --> 15:29.891
Right.

15:29.951 --> 15:34.817
And an anger about the way things are and a desire to change them in some way.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.799
I just don't feel that way.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.464
I find things amusing, a lot of things, and silly.

15:41.685 --> 15:47.492
I interpret a lot of things as amusing, but it's different.

15:47.512 --> 15:49.274
How do you get into your karmic mode?

15:50.736 --> 15:54.180
Oh, it's just I'm stuck with it.

15:54.447 --> 15:57.050
I mean, are you witty in company?

15:57.411 --> 16:01.716
No, I'm just deadly sort of earnest.

16:01.916 --> 16:09.024
Dave Barry, who I interviewed a couple of times, the problem is people really expect a performance from you.

16:09.044 --> 16:23.982
I wonder, do you find that kind of a... Well, I'm not well-known enough yet, but just in regular life when you go out to dinner and things like that, people expect some sparkle and wit.

16:24.248 --> 16:26.631
that's just the way it is.

16:26.771 --> 16:34.962
And I sort of sit, and whenever an opportunity comes up and something is... I can't remember anything.

16:35.042 --> 16:41.771
I can't remember anyone's name suddenly, and I'm just not... It's not the way my mind works.

16:41.851 --> 16:45.576
I don't make witticisms and fond mo and things like that.

16:45.596 --> 16:47.218
Yeah, well, we can't one-liners either.

16:47.238 --> 16:48.940
I think the humor of this

16:49.628 --> 16:49.968
book.

16:50.629 --> 16:52.051
You really have to be into the book.

16:52.251 --> 16:58.259
I know from reviewing it, it's not going to be that easy to just pull out a line.

16:58.279 --> 16:59.861
I mean, there are some very funny lines.

17:00.882 --> 17:04.246
But then I also have to set up the context as well, I think.

17:04.446 --> 17:16.741
Right, because it has to do more with the way people are, and the way they feel, and the way they see things, and how one person's perception clashes with another person's perception.

17:16.781 --> 17:18.083
I mean, that to me is

17:18.468 --> 17:35.426
what humor often is about, and misperception, which is one reason it's so much fun to write about families, because they're the perfect comic group, since you're stuck with them, and you didn't choose them, and you're all different, and there you are.

17:35.847 --> 17:39.551
But look at the difference between yourself, say, and Sue Miller, who writes about families.

17:41.152 --> 17:43.615
You're looking at the humorous sides of it.

17:43.763 --> 18:02.621
Well, that's just, you know, I mean, people deal with the world in different ways, and somehow, it's partly my family's very funny, and we, in general, have a sort of, you know, just, you know, I mean, you know, bad things happen, and they always turn everyone's just laughing.

18:02.641 --> 18:04.123
It's just the way we are.

18:04.583 --> 18:13.011
Just as a speculative question here, there's a publication in the Hamptons on Long Island that takes my stuff

18:13.548 --> 18:18.375
And I usually try and find some way to pitch them a story.

18:19.016 --> 18:24.925
I mean, is it possible that this, I mean, just could this be a place not unlike something of Manhattan?

18:25.286 --> 18:29.312
Oh yeah, I definitely had… I could kind of package it in that manner.

18:29.332 --> 18:32.437
One of the towns I had in mind was Sag Harbor.

18:32.457 --> 18:36.703
I really, I really… Have you spent any time out there at all?

18:37.223 --> 18:55.750
Yeah, I've spent some time out there, and, you know, I've spent summers out there, and I've just visited, and we used to sail and go there.

18:56.611 --> 19:06.505
And also, I mean, I go to Connecticut in the summer and stay at my mother's, but all of New York goes out there, so I, you know,

19:06.687 --> 19:12.334
Which is why I'm happy to be in this paper, and it really is a terrible newspaper.

19:12.354 --> 19:12.694
Really?

19:12.975 --> 19:14.657
But they pay very well.

19:14.717 --> 19:15.918
That's good.

19:15.958 --> 19:17.580
But they're basically incompetent.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.584
I mean, they have no .

19:20.624 --> 19:20.944
.

19:20.964 --> 19:20.985
.

19:21.465 --> 19:26.431
I don't have to transcribe all that soliloquy.

19:26.451 --> 19:28.153
No, that's right.

19:28.173 --> 19:29.935
So, we're talking about writing funny, I guess.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.640
Right.

19:33.805 --> 19:39.532
Give me a little bit of your background, because they really didn't give me a biographical thing.

19:39.552 --> 19:40.893
Okay, here's my background.

19:42.075 --> 19:46.320
I grew up in Westport, Connecticut, wanting to be a writer.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.504
Paul Newman's?

19:49.564 --> 19:50.565
Paul Newman's town.

19:50.605 --> 19:52.487
Neighbor or whatever.

19:52.668 --> 19:59.796
Yes, all of Westport is Paul Newman's neighborhood.

20:00.164 --> 20:05.711
I wrote poetry in high school that was really terrible and embarrassing, and you will find some of it in the book.

20:07.353 --> 20:10.578
That's mine, which I discovered.

20:10.838 --> 20:12.801
I really thought it had been destroyed.

20:12.821 --> 20:13.602
But you can use it.

20:13.622 --> 20:14.783
You've been able to recycle it.

20:14.823 --> 20:15.184
It's funny.

20:15.324 --> 20:23.775
I was delighted, but when I found it, I was looking at old letters for this book, and in this packet of old letters I found

20:24.093 --> 20:27.499
this folder full of poetry, and I almost died of embarrassment.

20:27.599 --> 20:29.923
I almost didn't use it, I was so embarrassed.

20:29.943 --> 20:35.413
But then the vanity of composition overcame me, and I used it.

20:36.054 --> 20:49.577
And then I went to Sarah Lawrence in order to study poetry, but the minute I got there, I got embarrassed and terrified, and I took animal behavior in medieval history.

20:50.013 --> 20:53.958
and I thought I was going to become a medievalist.

20:56.301 --> 21:03.009
I eventually went to graduate school in medieval history, which I was terrible at, University of Chicago.

21:03.030 --> 21:04.151
I was freezing cold.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.695
I was very disoriented.

21:07.856 --> 21:11.180
I have a terrible memory, so I got everything mixed up.

21:12.301 --> 21:13.623
It was awful.

21:13.683 --> 21:16.847
I mean, they were very nice to me and sort of said,

21:16.979 --> 21:18.641
you can have an M.A.

21:18.661 --> 21:20.043
if you'll go away.

21:22.666 --> 21:25.109
So I went away without even getting the degree.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.073
Could you handle manuscripts?

21:28.654 --> 21:29.935
Yeah, it was great.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.397
It was very exciting.

21:31.718 --> 21:38.346
But I realized that I was in the wrong field when I got a fellowship and went to Florence for the summer.

21:38.947 --> 21:43.172
And it was in paleography, which is studying handwriting and

21:43.692 --> 21:46.916
Humphrey Wanley is in my book, and he was a paleographer.

21:46.936 --> 21:47.216
Really?

21:47.476 --> 21:48.758
And it was wonderful.

21:48.798 --> 21:52.622
I'd sit in the library and I'd look at all these funny little signs and scripts and everything.

21:52.802 --> 22:01.292
But then I'd get sort of bored and hot, and I just spent most of the summer buying shoes in Florence.

22:01.312 --> 22:03.234
And I thought, there's something wrong.

22:03.274 --> 22:05.016
Perhaps I'm in the wrong profession.

22:06.298 --> 22:07.479
So I left graduate school.

22:07.899 --> 22:11.083
I decided I would become a buyer, since I like to buy shoes.

22:11.401 --> 22:14.765
But, you know, you have to actually have some talent.

22:14.865 --> 22:18.410
And Melda Marcos would have been a good contact.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.311
Mentrix.

22:19.932 --> 22:25.359
And so anyway, I luckily couldn't even get an interview to be a buyer anywhere.

22:25.399 --> 22:32.107
And a friend of mine, a friend of the family, was an editor at the Village Voice at the time.

22:32.708 --> 22:39.737
And I had been in the hospital for a year and had all these problems with my hips, and it was pretty much a nightmare.

22:40.055 --> 22:44.140
And she said, why don't you write about that for The Voice?

22:44.981 --> 22:46.683
Who was the editor?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.087
Her name was Margo Hentoff.

22:49.547 --> 22:50.849
Oh, is she related to Nat?

22:51.009 --> 22:52.231
She's Nat's wife, yeah.

22:52.251 --> 22:55.415
And they're very close friends of the family.

22:55.675 --> 22:59.159
And so I said, well, okay, I'll try writing it.

22:59.940 --> 23:02.564
And I wrote a piece, and it was very, you know, it was fun.

23:02.624 --> 23:04.907
It was really good, and I was really happy.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.170
And how old are you at this point?

23:07.530 --> 23:09.032
I was 20...

23:10.463 --> 23:11.885
That's pretty good.

23:11.905 --> 23:12.606
Something like that.

23:12.626 --> 23:14.929
Usually we were all driven to be writers from, you know.

23:15.590 --> 23:18.715
I was driven when I was little, and then I got driven away.

23:18.815 --> 23:24.083
I mean, I was really frightened of it, and I didn't want to try it and fail.

23:24.123 --> 23:27.107
To have that kind of a positive response from your first piece, though.

23:27.147 --> 23:31.213
Now, if it had been bad, do you think that would have tried buying a canton?

23:31.233 --> 23:32.435
That would have been the end of it.

23:32.455 --> 23:34.338
But this is how Margot edited it.

23:35.119 --> 23:36.741
She'd look at it, and she'd say,

23:37.008 --> 23:40.151
well, there's something, I don't like this part so much.

23:40.171 --> 23:42.214
And I said, well, could you be specific?

23:42.234 --> 23:43.255
And she'd say, yes.

23:43.435 --> 23:50.203
And she'd take a red pen, and she'd go like this, and just knock it out, and turn the page, and go, and cross it out.

23:50.223 --> 23:52.425
But then other times... She was willing to work with you.

23:52.445 --> 23:53.246
Oh, she was wonderful.

23:53.366 --> 24:04.198
And, you know, I said... She said, you know, just... She said, I know how you talk, and I've, you know, and I know the way you see things, and just pretend you're writing a letter.

24:04.238 --> 24:05.119
Just sit down and write it.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.120
So you were very lucky to Cameron.

24:06.370 --> 24:15.019
She's been, throughout my life, she's sort of served as both a model and a teacher, and Nat was also very good to me.

24:15.300 --> 24:30.957
When I was in seventh grade, my English teacher gave me a really hard time all year, because I was sort of rebellious and obnoxious, and she hated everything I wrote and hated everything I said.

24:30.977 --> 24:35.702
It was very depressing, and my mother, my wonderful mother, took one of my papers and

24:35.902 --> 24:47.745
sent it to Nat, and Nat wrote back a postcard, which I still have hanging over my desk, which says, your teacher's an ass, you're a real writer, best Nat.

24:47.765 --> 24:48.426
Isn't that nice?

24:48.446 --> 24:49.388
Yeah, it was wonderful.

24:50.026 --> 24:53.191
Are they still down, you mentioned the Strand, are they still down there on Broadway?

24:53.631 --> 24:56.235
Well that's where his office, his office was on.

24:56.355 --> 24:57.557
Broadway and 14th were there on there.

24:57.577 --> 24:58.138
The Strand?

24:58.598 --> 25:00.361
The Strand is at Broadway and 13th, I think.

25:00.381 --> 25:01.062
13th, right.

25:01.362 --> 25:04.487
But the voice used to be... No, yeah, I guess it is.

25:04.507 --> 25:05.288
I haven't been there.

25:05.568 --> 25:10.916
When I was working there, I was at 11th and University, so I think it is... I don't know.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.198
I haven't been there in a long time.

25:13.259 --> 25:15.763
So anyway, Margot was great.

25:15.997 --> 25:18.481
As she was editing this piece, there were parts of it.

25:18.501 --> 25:20.804
She said, well, this doesn't belong in the article.

25:20.864 --> 25:22.086
Save it for your novel.

25:22.968 --> 25:24.350
And I said, oh, my novel.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.111
Okay.

25:25.752 --> 25:27.274
And I just sat down.

25:27.314 --> 25:28.256
That's amazing.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.317
I said, okay.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.320
I do whatever Margot says.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.363
So she said, you're writing a novel.

25:33.403 --> 25:35.066
So I said, oh, I must be writing a novel.

25:35.266 --> 25:41.536
And, you know, that novel is very unskilled in a lot of ways.

25:41.656 --> 25:42.477
It's published, right?

25:42.676 --> 25:44.698
You know what, I'm very, very proud of it.

25:44.758 --> 25:45.919
I love it, actually.

25:45.939 --> 25:46.780
Who published it?

25:46.880 --> 25:47.301
Knopf.

25:47.621 --> 25:48.542
How can you beat that?

25:48.562 --> 25:49.223
It was great.

25:49.323 --> 25:49.803
I couldn't.

25:50.204 --> 25:52.766
And it was very well received, and John Updike reviewed it.

25:52.827 --> 25:53.647
It was wonderful.

25:53.667 --> 25:54.368
It was amazing.

25:55.049 --> 25:57.551
What year was that?

25:57.712 --> 26:00.835
It came out the year my son was born, which is 83.

26:00.975 --> 26:04.278
Four books in 12 years.

26:04.358 --> 26:06.861
It's very episodic.

26:07.313 --> 26:11.419
You know, it's one, because what I did was, I thought all you have to do is get to the end.

26:11.459 --> 26:14.644
You don't have to think about structure, which I didn't know how to think about.

26:15.044 --> 26:16.927
You just have to, there's the beginning, a middle, and an end.

26:16.947 --> 26:21.013
It was autobiographical, so I didn't have to really worry about what the story was.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.116
And I just wrote a page a day.

26:23.256 --> 26:24.478
That was what I did.

26:24.578 --> 26:29.946
So it took me a year, and it's 365 pages approximately.

26:30.365 --> 26:32.208
Manuscript pages or book pages?

26:32.228 --> 26:34.070
Yeah, I think so, or typed pages.

26:34.110 --> 26:37.275
So each page is sort of a little episode, but it works.

26:37.335 --> 26:40.259
I mean, it's on its own terms.

26:40.700 --> 26:44.806
And you got those kind of reviews, and so you were... It was wonderful.

26:45.026 --> 26:53.338
My second book took me seven years to write then, because I then had two children, and it was just impossible to do anything.

26:54.219 --> 26:59.967
And by then, that book, you know, I had trouble selling it.

27:00.841 --> 27:02.663
My first editor was not interested.

27:02.723 --> 27:06.288
It went to a lot of different places.

27:06.348 --> 27:08.531
That's so disheartening, yeah.

27:09.212 --> 27:16.621
But finally, you know, it wound up at Farrar Strauss, which I was very happy about, and had a wonderful editor named Michael DiCapua.

27:16.641 --> 27:18.384
That's very, very well known.

27:18.404 --> 27:28.857
And, you know, he makes you work very hard, and he made me, in a way, be able to take myself more seriously.

27:29.242 --> 27:31.184
It was a big breakthrough.

27:31.224 --> 27:39.314
And while editing that book, which was called To the Birdhouse, I started thinking about Ramos' niece.

27:39.334 --> 27:41.937
And that was a big change at that moment.

27:43.099 --> 27:47.985
I mean, I love the first two books, but these last books are just, they're different.

27:48.005 --> 27:50.868
I mean, in a way I think... You elevated your craft.

27:51.349 --> 27:58.017
Well, you know, in a way I think I'll never write a book as good as Alice in Bed, my first book, because it had a certain...

27:58.216 --> 28:04.142
On the other hand, I think in other ways, I think these books are better.

28:04.162 --> 28:05.703
Oh, you're more professional now.

28:05.723 --> 28:08.185
Yeah, so it's a mix.

28:08.346 --> 28:09.667
And it's not as if I have a choice.

28:09.747 --> 28:18.095
I can't write another first novel, and at the time I couldn't write a fourth novel, so I'm happy to... Are you at work on the fifth novel?

28:18.115 --> 28:24.101
I'm just starting to kind of think about who's who and what it might be about.

28:24.141 --> 28:26.243
And you live in New York, I think you said?

28:26.263 --> 28:27.784
Yeah, I live in Manhattan.

28:28.675 --> 28:29.998
And I have two little boys.

28:30.158 --> 28:30.278
Great.

28:30.358 --> 28:31.721
How old?

28:31.781 --> 28:36.290
Their birthdays are in June, and one's going to be twelve, and one's going to be eight.

28:37.092 --> 28:37.874
I have two daughters.

28:38.335 --> 28:39.457
How old are they?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.822
Twelve and almost fourteen.

28:42.463 --> 28:43.164
Oh, man.

28:43.205 --> 28:44.527
We have a Labrador Retriever.

28:44.547 --> 28:45.449
You're in the thick of it.

28:46.070 --> 28:47.393
Yeah.

28:47.913 --> 28:50.275
share the same birthday, which is tomorrow.

28:50.816 --> 28:51.957
Oh, happy birthday.

28:52.177 --> 28:53.719
And it's my 52nd birthday.

28:54.019 --> 28:55.680
Oh, that's how old my husband is, too.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.822
And that's a big deal.

28:56.882 --> 29:03.268
I was telling my editor the other day, and I said, you know what, Alan, I said, this is, and wouldn't you know, I had a take.

29:03.968 --> 29:14.038
You have no trouble, obviously, writing about the sexuality of a woman, being a woman, but I find that with little Johnny, you're able to actually kind of put yourself

29:14.626 --> 29:17.749
Well, you know, we writers.

29:18.690 --> 29:25.297
Yeah, but I know women like Mary Gordon who will readily admit that she can't do men, you know, every time she tries.

29:25.317 --> 29:36.309
Well, I had a lot of trouble, less with the sexuality, which I think there's a certain universal quality to sexual excitement, perhaps.

29:36.569 --> 29:42.996
But I had trouble getting inside Johnny's head and trying to see the world

29:43.448 --> 29:45.670
through a man's eye.

29:45.730 --> 29:47.271
Especially the one that young, it seems.

29:47.291 --> 30:01.924
Well, you know, in a way I felt it was easier to do a young kid than to do an adult, because I think that there are certain very strong predilections that young people have, and I think it's shared by girls and boys.

30:01.944 --> 30:04.126
And it's probably more transparent, too.

30:04.246 --> 30:05.767
Yeah, I think that's true.

30:05.807 --> 30:12.493
And so I felt that somehow his youth was what I could concentrate on rather than his maleness.

30:12.743 --> 30:14.166
That may be a weakness.

30:14.526 --> 30:15.007
I don't know.

30:15.087 --> 30:16.650
I worked very hard on it.

30:17.572 --> 30:20.857
And I personally fell in love with him and thought he was wonderful.

30:21.659 --> 30:26.287
And a lot of men I know have read it and felt very close to him.

30:26.808 --> 30:28.150
Well, I told you.

30:28.170 --> 30:29.152
I said, every kid's green.

30:29.312 --> 30:29.733
Yeah.

30:30.134 --> 30:36.405
But other guys think it's sort of silly and sentimental.

30:36.807 --> 30:44.959
And, you know, there's a long tradition, a literary tradition, of these kinds of relationships, but it's not an American tradition.

30:45.239 --> 30:47.823
Kind of like Lolita in reverse, in a way.

30:47.843 --> 30:48.204
Lolita in reverse.

30:48.244 --> 31:00.021
I mean, Colette wrote about this, and what's his name, Raymond Radigay, and there's a wonderful Canadian writer who's actually Hungarian, I think, but he wrote a book called In Praise of Older Women, which is fantastic.

31:00.061 --> 31:01.343
Oh, that's a famous book.

31:01.363 --> 31:02.625
I read it when I was a kid.

31:02.645 --> 31:03.306
It's terrific, actually.

31:03.326 --> 31:04.047
It's great.

31:04.145 --> 31:10.614
But it's not a real American literary thing that happens.

31:13.257 --> 31:15.420
But, you know, it was not so easy.

31:15.501 --> 31:16.742
I mean, I had to really think about it.

31:16.762 --> 31:21.389
And you had mentioned earlier that your first two novels had continuing characters, is that right?

31:21.669 --> 31:23.271
Yeah, it's the same family.

31:23.872 --> 31:28.458
Well, I mean, are these characters safely between the covers of this book?

31:28.478 --> 31:33.325
Yes, I think this is a discreet incident, this book.

31:33.710 --> 31:40.858
Sometimes, because I get very attached to my characters, I think of bringing them back in a minor role in another book.

31:42.220 --> 31:46.505
But I'm not sure if that would be coy in some way or gimmicky.

31:47.046 --> 31:47.546
I don't know.

31:47.667 --> 31:59.521
But, you know, to me, they all seem kind of... They all still exist, and I sometimes think about what they would think about something or what they would do, and so it's a temptation.

31:59.661 --> 32:01.523
But I don't know.

32:02.009 --> 32:10.722
But no, these, I think certainly Helen and Johnny are, they're sort of left in that little limbo at the end.

32:10.742 --> 32:13.807
And she has her flaws, too, doesn't she, her character.

32:14.147 --> 32:15.670
I certainly think so.

32:15.750 --> 32:19.175
I mean, I wanted to make her a flawed character.

32:19.255 --> 32:24.002
I like writing about flawed characters, particularly women.

32:24.383 --> 32:30.312
And one of the... And her selfishness is kind of...

32:31.574 --> 32:38.322
She's selfish, and she's tough, and she's smug, and she's egotistical.

32:38.763 --> 32:40.986
I don't think those are terrible things.

32:41.727 --> 32:45.031
But there are things that she wants.

32:45.071 --> 32:48.475
Yeah, I think those are some of the things that make a person interesting.

32:48.995 --> 32:52.219
If that's all there is, then they're not very appealing.

32:52.340 --> 32:59.168
But one of the great challenges and pleasures in this book and all my books, really, has been...

32:59.418 --> 33:05.185
trying to write about a character who is flawed but with whom the reader can sympathize.

33:07.207 --> 33:26.691
For the first three books, I read Emma before writing each of them just because she's a sort of quintessential perfect heroine who is unsympathetic and yet completely sympathetic.

33:27.093 --> 33:29.175
And the other one is Mary Poppins.

33:29.675 --> 33:34.961
I don't know if you've read Mary Poppins as an adult, but it's quite amazing.

33:34.981 --> 33:37.963
Well, I read it as an adult and I thought, how does she do this?

33:38.024 --> 33:38.964
This is magic.

33:39.065 --> 33:40.726
How does she make this woman appealing?

33:40.806 --> 33:42.288
She's such a bitch.

33:43.989 --> 33:52.498
So that was, yes, she's meant to be flawed and interesting and, you know, full.

33:53.178 --> 33:54.880
It's a nice summer story, too.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.121
I wouldn't call it a summer read.

33:56.270 --> 33:58.412
But it's a nice summer story.

33:59.353 --> 34:06.842
You know, summer's very important to me, because I get out of the city, and I love being in the country, and I'm never there.

34:07.122 --> 34:11.627
And Westport is no longer the country, but you can pretend.

34:11.707 --> 34:17.754
And my mother's house is, you know, sort of surrounded by honeysuckle, and so you can't see anybody else.

34:17.814 --> 34:25.062
And it's a little oasis, and it's a very powerful

34:25.430 --> 34:28.875
feeling when I get out there, and I love it.

34:29.035 --> 34:34.662
And Ramos' niece took place completely indoors, and I really felt the need to.

34:35.483 --> 34:36.565
I'm going to have to get that.

34:37.045 --> 34:40.670
I'm going to run because I'm close to getting a $30 ticket.

34:40.710 --> 34:41.731
Don't get a $30 ticket.

34:41.751 --> 34:44.134
Would you do me the honors on that?

34:44.635 --> 34:44.935
Yes.

34:45.256 --> 34:45.536
You would.

34:45.737 --> 34:48.400
I have what has to be done.
