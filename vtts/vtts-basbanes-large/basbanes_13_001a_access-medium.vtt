WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:07.586
They kindly take me under their wings once a year.

00:08.547 --> 00:16.675
They send me back to the hitherlands of New Hampshire, supposedly feeling a little better from this fresh mountain air.

00:18.056 --> 00:23.402
What I neglect to tell them is that we actually have fresh mountain air.

00:23.702 --> 00:32.130
It's just that we have to wait for it to rain a little more frequently because we get all that acid stuff from in the Midwest, but it's good to be here.

00:32.313 --> 00:33.735
and I'm really pleased to be here.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.141
So picture this.

00:43.246 --> 00:50.315
I'm on the third floor, Scram, a bookstore, New York City.

00:50.335 --> 00:54.600
And I'm thinking to myself, what a place.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.004
This is the store that's been around in New York forever.

00:59.145 --> 01:00.447
It's the store that's built

01:00.764 --> 01:02.326
Tremendous collections.

01:02.346 --> 01:12.539
It's the store that authors who we revere today, Faulkner, Hemingway, Annis Ninn, have always have walked through those aisles.

01:15.163 --> 01:25.256
I'm talking with Marvin, the bookseller, the book buyer of 30 years for the Strand, and he's installing the great virtues of this store, and I'm just enthralled.

01:27.859 --> 01:30.703
I leave Marvin, and I go downstairs into the bowels

01:31.223 --> 01:37.974
of the Strand, which is really where the experience of the Strand happens.

01:37.994 --> 01:43.623
And I'm walking around, and all of a sudden I hear this voice.

01:45.546 --> 01:47.569
I can't see anybody, but I hear this voice.

01:48.370 --> 01:48.811
It's here.

01:49.312 --> 01:50.093
I know it's here.

01:52.397 --> 01:53.278
I know it's here.

01:53.298 --> 01:54.180
I've got to find it.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.081
It's here.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.767
So I'm now curious.

02:00.873 --> 02:08.766
And I start trying to find the voice and I start chasing it through the aisles and I'm going from travel to a dramatic attack.

02:10.769 --> 02:22.628
And about the fourth aisle I catch up with it and I run around the corner and all of a sudden I literally bump into Nicholas Vansman.

02:22.648 --> 02:26.234
And I said, Nicholas, what are you doing here?

02:27.536 --> 02:28.197
And he kind of

02:28.615 --> 02:34.201
At first, he's trying to be polite, but you know in his eyes he's got this goal, this mission.

02:34.742 --> 02:38.266
He gives me a hello, but he's off in another world.

02:39.808 --> 02:40.929
And I said, what is it?

02:42.631 --> 02:43.071
It's here.

02:43.612 --> 02:44.373
I know it's here.

02:45.334 --> 02:46.295
I've got to find it.

02:47.296 --> 02:47.897
What, what?

02:47.977 --> 02:50.860
And I'm saying, if I can get it for him.

02:51.329 --> 02:54.494
I'm younger.

02:55.175 --> 03:03.288
I can dash up to the second floor, get through the checkout counter, and be lost in a city of 10 million people before he knew what's happened.

03:03.788 --> 03:07.774
And he finally says, it's got to be here.

03:07.935 --> 03:09.297
I says, what, Nicholas?

03:09.317 --> 03:12.302
He says, that unsigned John Dunning novel.

03:13.043 --> 03:17.229
That's good.

03:18.772 --> 03:19.092
I'm out of here.

03:20.843 --> 03:27.130
You see, I'm the non-fiction one.

03:27.150 --> 03:30.914
I have to tell you, it's giving me great pleasure to make that story up.

03:31.134 --> 03:37.961
I started to put it together, I said, I'm not having one of these seen you more.

03:37.981 --> 03:39.343
We did meet at the Strand.

03:39.363 --> 03:41.124
There is a thread of truth to all stories.

03:42.786 --> 03:49.213
And the truth of it is, I did meet Nicholas Baffing last February in the basement of the Strand.

03:49.733 --> 04:03.150
It is true, I was on the third floor talking with Marvin, and I said to Nicholas after we said hello, I said, you know, Nicholas, it would be wonderful to have you and John Dunning on a platform together.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.652
I said, you guys are just great.

04:05.132 --> 04:06.935
I said, I know John, I know you.

04:07.355 --> 04:13.062
I said, you know, you both are opinionated, you've got ideas, you know, something could happen.

04:14.584 --> 04:17.047
And he says, great.

04:18.729 --> 04:19.150
I said,

04:19.838 --> 04:20.559
call John.

04:21.340 --> 04:31.752
Well, John is off on the road, so I write him an email, little did I know, he's on this 10,000 mile book tour from, I think he refers to it as the book tour tour of hell.

04:33.535 --> 04:38.581
And I start emailing him.

04:38.681 --> 04:49.474
So my first email, I kind of try to set it up, and I tell him, you know, Nicholas Batchman really likes your works, he's never had a chance to meet you, he wants to meet you, how about coming to New Hampshire and doing a program?

04:49.808 --> 04:52.191
And I get this short little curse response.

04:52.631 --> 04:53.452
I don't fly.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.358
So I say to myself, all right, let me try again.

04:58.378 --> 05:00.520
So I grovel through a couple more emails.

05:01.081 --> 05:05.566
And John finally writes back to me and says, why don't you guys come out here?

05:06.447 --> 05:10.291
Now, I'm guessing that John's thinking that that's going to finish that story.

05:11.532 --> 05:16.017
But John didn't know that my resources were a little deeper than he might have expected.

05:16.158 --> 05:18.280
And I got through to the committee and to Lois.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.743
and they loved the idea, and now we are here.

05:23.145 --> 05:28.270
And that part is really exciting.

05:28.290 --> 05:33.496
So, why are we here today?

05:35.838 --> 05:36.960
Where's the bar?

05:37.220 --> 05:41.204
Yes, okay, why are we here today?

05:42.385 --> 05:47.811
Well, in a few well-known paraphrased words,

05:48.297 --> 05:49.939
It's the story, stupid.

05:52.162 --> 05:53.023
That's why we're here.

05:54.345 --> 05:55.206
It's the story.

05:55.246 --> 06:03.918
It's the story not just of every book, but the story about every book, about every copy of every book.

06:03.938 --> 06:14.532
It's the story about who wrote it, who owned it, who signed it, who read it, who collected it, how did it get here, why is it different from any other copy or printing?

06:15.073 --> 06:16.515
What's the association?

06:17.407 --> 06:19.349
What's unusual about this copy?

06:19.369 --> 06:20.370
Where did I find it?

06:20.991 --> 06:24.375
What a bargain I got here.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.397
How does it fit into my collection?

06:27.499 --> 06:34.927
These are all the stories we tell when we show our books and talk about our collection.

06:34.947 --> 06:46.080
Well, today we have Nicholas Vassbain, who's written in Gentle Madness, Among the Gently Mad, Patience and Fortitude, in his latest book, Splendors of Letters,

06:46.972 --> 07:00.587
who has done a great service to the book world by collecting stories about book collectors, some of which may have been lost through the ages, were it not for his gift of investigative reporting.

07:03.630 --> 07:11.258
Nicholas writes about the life of the book, and we have John Dunn, who in his

07:11.643 --> 07:13.485
who really doesn't need an introduction.

07:13.525 --> 07:14.986
He writes about the death of the book.

07:18.710 --> 07:22.194
That's not interesting.

07:22.214 --> 07:24.436
He needs no introduction.

07:24.456 --> 07:39.372
You've been reading him since he worked at the Denver Post, his first book, Holland Suggestion, 1972, his Janeway novel, his encyclopedic bedtime book,

07:40.364 --> 07:48.133
on radio shows, in his chapbook, Book Scout, is a personal favorite.

07:48.673 --> 07:58.384
John gives life to the book, expecting that there someday may be apocryphal stories about this event here today.

08:01.668 --> 08:09.477
About these two men, locked, locked, tusk to tusk, in their stories about

08:10.132 --> 08:29.977
The story of Tales from the Trail, it is really a wonderful honor and a privilege to present for your pleasure, Nicholas Badmaine and John Beckham.

08:29.997 --> 08:33.321
We've got to get more money.

08:33.807 --> 08:36.189
Should we go alphabetically or the hometown guy?

08:36.530 --> 08:38.071
You go.

08:38.091 --> 08:40.194
BA, right?

08:40.214 --> 08:41.195
The husband goes first.

08:42.376 --> 08:48.903
Well, I have to tell you, it really is a great thrill and a great honor for me to not only be here at the Rocky Mountain Book Fair.

08:48.923 --> 08:51.585
It's my first trip ever to Denver.

08:51.686 --> 08:54.468
I did come through once on the way to Colorado Springs.

08:55.429 --> 09:02.717
And as a person who really is committed and dedicated to book culture, book people, book places, anything pertaining to and involving books,

09:03.119 --> 09:04.300
from every aspect of it.

09:05.542 --> 09:10.167
I've always felt that one of the great book cities I really had not been to is Denver.

09:10.187 --> 09:17.335
So when this discussion started generating with Richard, he didn't really accost me in the stand, but it was close I got to say.

09:18.136 --> 09:19.017
I'm teasing.

09:19.037 --> 09:21.940
It was very nice to chat with him, but I was kind of selling books.

09:21.960 --> 09:27.827
You know what that's like when you're involved in a transaction?

09:28.178 --> 09:49.832
comes up, and first of all, you're nervous because somebody recognizes you, you know, and I think, my goodness, I have my hat on with my name on the back of it, but anyway, it was a delight to chat with Richard, and he was proposing this thing up in New Hampshire, and I said, yeah, really, do you think John wants to come up to the, I mean, New Hampshire is wonderful, and I'm a lifelong New England guy.

09:50.386 --> 10:07.928
But I said, on the whole, I'm really much rather go out to Denver and visit this great book city and to come to this fair and to really, for me it's kind of like paying homage to a person I have the greatest respect and admiration for, and that is John Dunning.

10:08.068 --> 10:10.371
And now I'm not teething.

10:10.391 --> 10:15.077
Here we are on this same program, Tales of the Trail, and if I am

10:15.631 --> 10:21.543
The Boswell of the book collecting world, which I, it's not bad, I haven't been called that yet, but I'll call it myself.

10:22.425 --> 10:31.765
If I may digress, my wife, but I've mentioned this at the Colorado State yet, and I forget how there's some, how do they introduce me to something of the book world?

10:32.126 --> 10:33.268
The teen, yeah, the teen.

10:33.839 --> 10:36.402
I said, that's a new one, the dean of the book world.

10:36.622 --> 10:42.087
My wife and I went to Chattanooga, Tennessee once, and the local paper said, the king of the bibliophiles.

10:42.187 --> 10:42.768
I said, wow.

10:44.089 --> 10:47.152
And Connie was with me, and she said, he's impossible enough to live with now.

10:47.192 --> 10:49.615
Now he's really going to be insufferable.

10:50.115 --> 10:52.718
And I've also been described as the Johnny Appleseed.

10:52.798 --> 11:03.188
That's kind of fun, because Johnny Appleseed was a New Englander, and he traveled the country, and he sowed the seeds of apples, I guess apples.

11:03.488 --> 11:14.001
I like to think that I go around and just instilling this, if I can share my passion and my enthusiasm for books and for book people, that I'm doing something productive.

11:14.522 --> 11:16.624
But again, really what I am is a reporter.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.569
I am a storyteller first, but a reporter second.

11:21.250 --> 11:25.896
And what I determined early on is that I could never be a great collector.

11:25.916 --> 11:33.445
I could be a great collector if I had vast sums of money and if I were able to purchase the books that I would really like to have, but I knew that would never happen.

11:33.712 --> 11:39.000
but something I could do as a reporter and as a chronicle is collect collectors, and I've been pretty good at that.

11:39.681 --> 11:56.246
And I think those of you who are familiar with Gentle Madness, really one of the purposes of that book was to go out not only and to write about many of the great collectors through history, which is part one, but part two of that book, I thought I could do something which had never, in my view, been done before.

11:56.266 --> 11:57.508
It was to bring my

11:57.843 --> 12:10.914
modest skills of an investigative reporter, a good interviewer, a person who likes to go out and listen and see things and feel things and touch things and to go out and really write about many of the great collectors of today.

12:11.375 --> 12:26.348
And I thought it would be worthwhile not only to identify these people but to try and box the compass as it were, to do it not only geographically but in terms of those who afford to buy it, all levels of activity, and to write a bunch of stories.

12:27.070 --> 12:28.973
It really is storytelling.

12:29.013 --> 12:33.001
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing, is the way I look at it.

12:33.021 --> 12:40.534
If there's not a good story attached to whatever it is I'm trying to describe, then I will find an instance where there is a good story.

12:40.554 --> 12:44.802
But if I'm the Boswell to complete that thought, I do tend to ramble.

12:44.842 --> 12:46.064
This is Homer over here.

12:46.204 --> 12:47.847
I'm the reporter.

12:48.012 --> 12:48.974
And this is the poet.

12:50.736 --> 12:56.165
So it really is, for me, a great, and I told you I was going to use that line, too, and you said, you better not, I'm out of here.

12:56.265 --> 13:01.634
Out of here, you have to forgive me for the accent.

13:01.654 --> 13:13.834
So it really will be a lot of fun to talk a little bit about some tales of, I guess, is it on the trail or from the trail, a book collecting more of people that I've

13:14.017 --> 13:21.608
been able to meet and write about, and I really have covered every aspect, I mean, from one extreme to the other.

13:21.969 --> 13:30.421
Steven Blumberg, those of you who may be familiar with Chapter 13 of Gentle Madness, called the Blumberg Collection, a rather ironic title.

13:30.441 --> 13:38.092
This is the individual who, over a 20-year period, collected 25,000 books, 20-year period.

13:38.472 --> 13:43.720
Conservatively, the value is conservatively estimated at $20 million.

13:44.341 --> 13:46.003
The one question was provenance.

13:46.724 --> 13:57.696
329 libraries in 45 states, two Canadian provinces in the District of Columbia, fully 95% of which were never known to be missing until the day he was arrested in 1990.

13:59.838 --> 14:03.382
Ken Sanders is here in the back of the room, the ADAA security man.

14:03.442 --> 14:07.847
He'll tell you this is probably the most knowledgeable man in the United States on book theft.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.091
Steven Blumberg, I think we can say, is wise.

14:11.510 --> 14:14.194
the most accomplished book thief of the 20th century.

14:14.234 --> 14:20.983
Here I was embarked on writing a book about the wonderful aspects of bibliomania.

14:21.003 --> 14:30.395
The whole premise of A Gentle Madness was so much of what we value of our history, our culture, our literature would be lost forever if it were for book collectors.

14:30.435 --> 14:32.578
I'm looking around for the vacant looks.

14:33.399 --> 14:37.104
I'm not getting them, thankfully, because we are among kindred spirits.

14:37.124 --> 14:41.230
These are book people here, but I have to say that I was a reporter and a journalist and a

14:41.412 --> 14:44.096
book editor, people would say to me, what are you working on?

14:44.196 --> 14:50.725
And I would say, I'm working on a book about book collectors, and I would get this blank book.

14:51.066 --> 14:58.416
And I'd start telling them, and then the next book, of course, Patience and Fortitude, which is a library, and that really got their attention.

14:58.497 --> 15:03.444
And I would tell them, this is very interesting, there's a chapter in there about off-site storage.

15:03.464 --> 15:06.508
Well, that really, that really is brilliant.

15:06.910 --> 15:12.498
I swear I was introduced once at a program as the author of A Gentle Madness and Pride and Prejudice.

15:12.518 --> 15:19.567
And I had to say, look, this is not a lost Jane Austen novel.

15:19.627 --> 15:30.122
Patience and Fortitude are the names of the lions that stand guide in front of the New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue in New York, so named during the years of the Great Depression.

15:30.142 --> 15:33.947
Now, this is the world expert, the world authority on radio.

15:34.197 --> 15:51.747
Mayor LaGuardia used to give these Sunday night broadcasts during the years of the Great Depression, and he would unfailingly conclude his remarks by saying words to the effect, what we need to see us through the great ordeal that lay ahead are to exercise the twin virtues of patience and fortitude.

15:52.588 --> 15:55.513
And prior to that, the lines of Tennessee Pink Marble, which

15:55.763 --> 16:11.863
stand guard outside the public library, named, I think, Lennox and Aster, after James Lennox and John Jacob Aster, who were patrons, early patrons of the library, the names thereafter of Patience and Fortitude.

16:11.903 --> 16:13.865
What a great image and metaphor to choose.

16:14.786 --> 16:18.531
Here we are, these declining years of the 20th century, and

16:18.815 --> 16:23.683
And the whole mission, the future of the library is being debated.

16:23.703 --> 16:43.373
I don't think there's any question that libraries will continue into process, but the role and the function of the printed book, the future of the printed book, I thought this image of Lyon's standing guide at the gates of knowledge worked, although occasionally it is confused what in the world is patience and poetry that has to do with book culture.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.037
But that's where that title comes from.

16:46.304 --> 16:53.353
It's been wonderful, I have to say, traveling the country, going to the trial of Steven Blumberg.

16:53.413 --> 16:59.501
This book was supposed to be about people who preserved culture, preserved literature, preserved history.

17:00.262 --> 17:11.277
I find myself in the middle of Iowa for two weeks in one of the coldest winters on record, attending this trial, where the man's defense, by the way, was not guilty by reason of insanity.

17:11.717 --> 17:13.780
Now, if you have a book titled A Gentle Madness,

17:13.928 --> 17:26.022
And this is the only case, I think, in the history of American jurisprudence where what amounts to a case of criminal bibliomania where the defense is going to be insanity.

17:26.062 --> 17:28.545
I did it because I was crazy.

17:28.565 --> 17:40.780
That is a very appealing concept for me, I have to say, and prompted me to take what was supposed to be an 18-month project and it became an eight-year project, a book that

17:41.030 --> 17:47.820
And it's the first contract that I had with Random House that was supposed to be, the book was supposed to be in about 1990, 1991.

17:47.940 --> 17:58.315
It was supposed to be 95,000 words and the final product eight years later with another publisher, Random House Got Tired of Waiting, was $250 for it.

17:58.515 --> 18:08.910
And I'm going to let John talk a little bit now and if you'd like to hear a little bit more of some of the stories from the trail, I'd be more than happy to pick up on it.

18:09.734 --> 18:10.235
Thank you.

18:10.575 --> 18:10.855
Yes, sir.

18:11.416 --> 18:26.654
This is probably a good deal earthier than your part of the program because I think when we talk about, I've got a couple of Gentle Madness stories, but I came to this in a whole different way.

18:27.075 --> 18:29.798
I was a writer a long time ago.

18:31.901 --> 18:36.366
I had written five books, none of which really made any kind of a splash.

18:37.544 --> 18:40.507
most of which you didn't earn out, as they say in the book trade.

18:41.988 --> 18:49.476
That means that you get an advance and you don't make enough to pay your advance back.

18:49.496 --> 18:56.983
And around 1980, I hit the mother of all dry streaks where I couldn't sell anything.

18:57.003 --> 19:06.893
And my wife and I would walk around the neighborhood and talk about what's going to happen when I click again.

19:08.003 --> 19:14.211
She has amazing optimism.

19:14.231 --> 19:22.962
But there comes a time when you have the weight of rejection.

19:22.982 --> 19:28.930
Now I know what word always felt like when they pile the weight on.

19:28.950 --> 19:37.200
And I came to a point where I said, you know, as much as I love the idea of authorship and authorhood and writing books,

19:38.395 --> 19:42.300
Maybe it's time we did something else.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.703
It's been a long time since I've worked for any kind of living.

19:44.723 --> 19:52.813
So she had been in the foreign service, and she had a little nest egg from that.

19:53.975 --> 20:00.483
And when you live with a bookman or a writer, your money is never safe.

20:00.903 --> 20:04.588
And I generously offered to

20:05.868 --> 20:09.813
take her money and open a bookstore for her.

20:09.833 --> 20:15.780
You remember that Isaac Denison line, I had a farm in Africa, I had a bookstore on East Colt.

20:17.823 --> 20:28.676
What a life, we were there, we were there 10 years, and from the first day, it was like magic.

20:31.559 --> 20:33.782
There's a scene in my book, Book to Die,

20:34.235 --> 20:38.059
where they're building the bookstore, and they're building the shelves.

20:38.079 --> 20:42.203
And book scouts would come in off the street with bags of books.

20:42.423 --> 20:43.424
I didn't make this up.

20:45.926 --> 20:49.129
Book scouts would come in, and they would say, are you buying books?

20:49.910 --> 20:51.452
And I had books all over the floor.

20:53.073 --> 20:53.954
And I said, sure.

20:53.994 --> 21:01.221
And Steve Wilson was a guy down the street, a guy with a long, pointy beard, old ex-hippie.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.870
And he would come up, and he was a carpenter.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.752
He would help me build the shelves.

21:05.772 --> 21:10.398
And Steve would say, don't buy that.

21:11.038 --> 21:12.260
It's a dog.

21:13.501 --> 21:18.287
And don't ever buy a book by a female writer with three names.

21:18.307 --> 21:29.740
And don't buy a book that's, don't ever buy a book written by Jane Fonda or anybody.

21:29.956 --> 21:36.383
who has had a best seller attached to their name because there's 8 million copies in The Naked City and you'll die with it.

21:37.864 --> 21:47.214
On the other hand, if you have a book about the history of teeth in North Denver written by a dentist, North Denver was fairly colorful.

21:49.015 --> 21:50.937
And sometimes there wasn't anything left but teeth.

21:52.319 --> 21:54.661
And so he said, buy that.

21:55.762 --> 21:56.803
That's a $60 book.

21:57.644 --> 21:59.406
And I would say, how do you know that?

21:59.740 --> 22:00.801
And he said, just buy it.

22:01.342 --> 22:02.062
And I would buy it.

22:02.082 --> 22:05.165
And I would say, well, what am I going to sell it for?

22:05.425 --> 22:05.986
He said, $60.

22:06.086 --> 22:08.548
And I said, well, I'll die with this book.

22:08.568 --> 22:14.554
And he said, if you price it any lower than $60, I'll buy it.

22:15.555 --> 22:17.477
And I said, well, I don't want to have that.

22:19.419 --> 22:23.042
So price it at $60, and somebody would come in and buy it.

22:23.062 --> 22:27.807
And Nick was talking about the pet names we collect.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.926
I wasn't thinking of those great philosophers.

22:32.006 --> 22:36.592
I was thinking more of Moe, Larry, and Shemp, and I was Larry.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.395
He was the one who died.

22:38.475 --> 22:41.419
I don't know what Steve and Michael were.

22:41.439 --> 22:46.186
Michael was a guy up the street as well, but they were my mentors.

22:46.206 --> 22:49.310
I started out knowing diddly about books.

22:49.771 --> 22:50.492
I still don't know a lot.

22:50.592 --> 22:55.819
I found out that nobody knows all of it, and you can't

22:56.221 --> 22:57.322
You can be a specialist.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.104
You can be introduced as an expert.

22:59.164 --> 23:01.547
I'm always very queasy when they say that.

23:03.889 --> 23:07.213
So I drove my way along on East Colfax.

23:07.273 --> 23:08.254
Didn't write a word.

23:09.235 --> 23:11.638
I was in danger of never writing again.

23:11.658 --> 23:15.382
Or the world was in danger of never seeing it.

23:17.504 --> 23:24.692
But you know, no matter how discouraged you get, there's something about a writer who isn't writing

23:26.663 --> 23:31.049
And eventually, I wrote again and again.

23:31.389 --> 23:34.613
And I was really rusty when I started this book to die.

23:34.974 --> 23:37.237
And it was based on my stuff on East Colfax.

23:38.378 --> 23:39.860
Books to Book Scouts were real.

23:41.643 --> 23:44.607
People who came in stores were real enough.

23:44.747 --> 23:46.749
I hate to tell you how real some of them were.

23:47.971 --> 23:53.278
And I sent it off to New York to my agent.

23:54.338 --> 23:58.883
And she started sending it around, and nobody wanted it, it seemed.

23:58.903 --> 24:01.707
It went and went and went, and a year passed.

24:02.628 --> 24:09.996
And I looked at my wife one day, and the police were sitting in there on Saturday, and I had just gone to the post office and gotten my latest rejection on it.

24:10.918 --> 24:18.747
And I turned to her and I said, I don't think I want to do this anymore.

24:18.767 --> 24:23.232
I'm going to write to my agent and withdraw the book, and I'm going to be a happy book

24:23.566 --> 24:26.771
seller from now on.

24:30.036 --> 24:35.323
And that gentleman sitting right over there, he and I used to share an office.

24:35.343 --> 24:49.004
The guy in the yellow shirt, Mr. Warwick Downing Esquire, we used to share an office where we were both aging, he was more aging than I was, aspiring to keep it going, writers.

24:49.765 --> 24:52.729
And I went in that day to the office, and I sat down and I said,

24:53.266 --> 24:54.007
I've had it.

24:54.568 --> 24:55.649
I'm sick of this stuff.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.434
He said, well, what does that mean?

24:59.454 --> 25:02.538
And I said, I'm going to call the book back and I'm going to burn it.

25:02.558 --> 25:03.619
And he doesn't remember this.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.282
His memory is much faultier than mine.

25:07.144 --> 25:14.232
But he stood up there on his hind legs and he says, if you can even think of doing that, you're going to have to whip me.

25:15.394 --> 25:19.419
He's a wiry guy, smaller than I am.

25:19.439 --> 25:21.822
But he's sneaky.

25:22.291 --> 25:35.207
And I decided I didn't want to try that, so I sent it out one more time, and my agent wrote back and said, at last I get to make money.

25:37.509 --> 25:39.492
I don't care at this point.

25:39.512 --> 25:40.273
I said, I don't care.

25:40.293 --> 25:43.637
She said, you're not going to get much money, so don't.

25:43.657 --> 25:45.099
And I said, I don't care how much money.

25:45.199 --> 25:47.962
She said, Skridner wants to buy it.

25:49.324 --> 25:50.425
And I said, Skridner?

25:52.058 --> 25:54.420
House of Hemingway.

25:54.460 --> 25:58.204
Wolf, Fitzgerald, me.

25:59.184 --> 26:04.309
And I'm sitting there in my bookstore, and we've got about a $35 day going.

26:07.011 --> 26:09.634
There's a lot of those.

26:09.714 --> 26:13.297
Real booksellers like Ken Sanders back there don't know what it's like to have a day like that.

26:14.218 --> 26:16.100
There's nothing but excitement in that store.

26:16.120 --> 26:22.065
But we had a couple of customers who actually just made my life.

26:22.265 --> 26:31.394
I would start out in the morning, and I would cruise Capitol Hill in my car, and I would just suck these books up like a vacuum.

26:31.434 --> 26:32.635
You can't do this anymore.

26:32.815 --> 26:33.736
People don't put them out.

26:35.297 --> 26:39.661
I know, I get some of the blame for that, but, you know, maybe it's true, maybe it isn't.

26:39.741 --> 26:45.547
I would go along and they would throw out the entire Shelby Foote trilogy on the Civil War for $5.

26:45.727 --> 26:48.970
And I'd buy it and come back.

26:49.450 --> 26:51.192
And we had a couple of

26:51.391 --> 27:02.162
a couple of customers, Bob and Harvey Platts, who were usually there on Saturday, and when I would unload the truck, we would sell books on the street before I even got them in the store.

27:02.202 --> 27:02.963
What do you want for this?

27:03.663 --> 27:04.284
I don't know.

27:04.304 --> 27:05.725
I think that set's worth about $60.

27:07.067 --> 27:08.108
Why can't you do a little better?

27:08.208 --> 27:10.490
Well, you know, I got $5.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.612
$50.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.894
Okay, right out of check.

27:14.814 --> 27:19.339
And when I sold Bookman's Way,

27:20.652 --> 27:27.058
And then when I saw 2 o'clock Eastern wartime, I had, for the first time, a little bit of money.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.543
And we went to New York, and we went to the New York Book Fair.

27:33.105 --> 27:39.131
I know Ken knows what a danger that is to go into the New York Book Fair thinking you have some money in your pocket.

27:41.013 --> 27:49.461
And I told Helen, I said, I want to find out what it's like to buy a good book and actually pay for it.

27:49.812 --> 27:55.478
And I bought a beautiful copy of The Grapes of Wrath, a bookseller we know.

27:56.999 --> 28:02.705
A great guy came up to me and said, I got $7,500 on this.

28:04.467 --> 28:05.949
You can see, look at it.

28:06.569 --> 28:07.671
It's beautiful.

28:08.612 --> 28:11.114
I'll let you have it for five because it's you.

28:12.496 --> 28:14.558
And I wrote up a check and I handed it to him.

28:15.579 --> 28:16.680
And then I bought

28:17.437 --> 28:29.153
a copy of The Long Valley, and then I bought a copy of Mice and Men, and I walked out of there with a $10,000 tariff, and we got back to our hotel in New York, and I looked at her, and I said, what the hell did I just do?

28:30.735 --> 28:32.578
Is this the general madness or what?

28:32.918 --> 28:33.719
That's it.

28:35.001 --> 28:38.125
I don't do too much of that anymore.

28:38.145 --> 28:40.349
But it has been a trip.

28:40.369 --> 28:43.913
It has been a lot of fun trekking through the book world.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.258
And are we going to

28:47.592 --> 28:54.663
keep this up, or are we going to ask questions, answer questions, or are we going to try to answer questions?

28:54.683 --> 29:01.935
Richard, do you want us to answer questions, or do you want us to talk more?

29:01.955 --> 29:02.295
Talk more.

29:02.476 --> 29:02.936
Talk more.

29:02.956 --> 29:03.277
Talk more what?

29:03.297 --> 29:04.118
Talk more.

29:04.138 --> 29:04.819
You should talk more.

29:04.859 --> 29:05.240
Talk more.

29:05.280 --> 29:05.440
What?

29:06.342 --> 29:09.707
Well, I'll finish this story, and then you can have at it.

29:10.648 --> 29:11.089
I'm on deck.

29:12.431 --> 29:14.815
I got back to Denby, and

29:16.465 --> 29:36.705
All that story about my book scout, he used to come to the store, and the description of, I shouldn't say this too loud, I suppose there's still some action that could be taken about this, but he would come into the store, and he would, he was so difficult, he started out as a pussycat.

29:37.126 --> 29:42.231
He just, I had a reference section, and I said, it's open to anybody.

29:42.251 --> 29:43.732
You want to look my books up?

29:43.973 --> 29:44.093
Fine.

29:44.293 --> 29:46.455
When I come in, we'll talk about it.

29:46.705 --> 29:48.568
He was always desperate.

29:48.588 --> 29:50.791
These guys always lived from hand to mouth, you know.

29:50.811 --> 29:58.382
And I would come in and he would say, I think this is a $50 book, which means I would pay him $20 for it if I was going to sell it for $50.

29:58.402 --> 30:01.686
And I'd look at it and I'd say, is this what you found it for?

30:01.746 --> 30:02.828
I used to have these reference books.

30:02.848 --> 30:05.912
These were the great days before the Internet.

30:06.092 --> 30:08.736
The great days when nobody knew what anything was worth.

30:10.679 --> 30:12.441
And he just made it up.

30:12.461 --> 30:15.666
And some guys made it up better than others, and they were the ones that got rich.

30:16.253 --> 30:20.998
And so then they would get in these books called Bookman's Price Index, which I subscribe to.

30:21.939 --> 30:28.006
And we would look them up in there and find out that, hey, this is a $600 book.

30:29.067 --> 30:32.491
Well, if you can sell it, it's a $600 book.

30:32.511 --> 30:35.494
And he would say, I think this is a $100 book.

30:35.634 --> 30:39.118
And I would say, well, you know, there's four others in there that I can get for $20.

30:39.138 --> 30:39.999
And we would argue back.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.781
It became more and more difficult.

30:41.861 --> 30:45.805
And one day I took my hand and I slammed it down on the counter and I said,

30:46.628 --> 30:52.877
I swear to God, I'm going to write a book about the book trade, and I'm going to put you in it, and I'm going to kill you in the first line.

30:55.360 --> 31:02.650
It's just a coincidence that Bobby the Book Scout was killed at midnight.

31:02.670 --> 31:04.973
And he had cats, and he had them.

31:06.656 --> 31:10.181
I went over to his house one time, and we had the string of drop cord.

31:10.862 --> 31:12.003
He didn't have any electricity.

31:12.063 --> 31:14.847
From the next apartment, it was building darkness.

31:15.029 --> 31:16.852
And he had a light bulb and a drop cord.

31:16.872 --> 31:25.284
And I had to look at his books while cats trek through the place, kind of looking at the books.

31:25.484 --> 31:31.953
And I said, are these cats allowed to have their way in here with these books?

31:32.354 --> 31:34.036
And he said, no, no, they are well trained.

31:34.056 --> 31:36.079
And he put on and picked up the book and bummed it.

31:37.761 --> 31:39.263
He was a piece of work.

31:39.644 --> 31:40.625
And we had some fun.

31:41.787 --> 31:42.668
And then I got out of it.

31:42.688 --> 31:44.631
I still miss parts of it.

31:44.982 --> 31:48.526
I realized that I miss what isn't anymore.

31:49.688 --> 32:03.365
The internet came in, and it spawned a whole raft of people who are knowledgeable, but a whole raft of people who, as my friend Jane Wood would say, can't find their butt with both hands and our little telescope.

32:04.987 --> 32:05.988
Some of them are pathetic.

32:07.049 --> 32:12.576
Anyway, it's a different business today than it was one.

32:13.619 --> 32:16.842
I really sound a hundred years old, you know.

32:16.862 --> 32:19.845
And it's only been ten years ago that all this has happened.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.929
Please, start something before I speak again.

32:24.089 --> 32:25.971
Okay, well, it's been ten years for me, too.

32:26.411 --> 32:43.187
Gentle Madness was published in 1995, and I mentioned how it had been under contract to Random House, and they either tired of waiting for it or whatever, but they one day just unceremoniously said, when I'm publishing this book,

32:43.893 --> 32:52.342
And it was amazing how difficult it was, how almost impossible it was, to find a publisher in New York that would want to publish a book about book collectors.

32:52.362 --> 32:54.424
I said, well, you know, they said, who'd read it?

32:54.444 --> 32:58.589
And I said, you know, book collectors, maybe, to start with.

32:58.609 --> 32:59.290
That might work.

32:59.790 --> 33:02.433
And then, of course, I did have this huge book that was 250.

33:02.513 --> 33:02.713
It is.

33:03.054 --> 33:04.816
I mean, it's a four-pound book.

33:04.856 --> 33:06.718
I've never seen anyone read it on an airplane.

33:06.758 --> 33:11.503
I've seen your book, I have to say, people reading any number of John Denny's books.

33:11.905 --> 33:12.586
airplanes.

33:12.666 --> 33:15.050
Not only are they wonderful reads, they're compact.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.073
They don't weigh five pounds, six pounds.

33:17.734 --> 33:28.409
But the day will come when I will see someone carrying a Gentle Madness on an airplane and I'll embrace that person and take a dress and send out a copy of the next book.

33:28.450 --> 33:38.925
Happily, thankfully, a fellow who used to review books for me by the name of Alan Peacock, a young student at Harvard and I was still a book review editor in Worcester, Massachusetts.

33:39.260 --> 33:48.554
At that time was now a senior editor at Henry Holt of New York and heard that Nick was out there desperately trying to find someone who would publish his book.

33:48.995 --> 33:51.098
And Alan was on a roll at that time.

33:51.118 --> 33:54.623
He had had a couple of Pulitzer Prize winners.

33:54.683 --> 33:57.468
He was really the hot shot at Holt.

33:58.129 --> 33:59.130
He said, all right, send us.

33:59.310 --> 34:00.332
He called my agent.

34:00.452 --> 34:01.574
He said, send Nick's book over.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.376
And I'll never forget this day.

34:03.437 --> 34:05.740
I tear up when I think about it.

34:06.108 --> 34:07.710
He'd had it for the longest time.

34:07.730 --> 34:10.053
He was a notorious, really slow reader.

34:10.994 --> 34:19.125
And then one Thanksgiving, it was 1994, 1993, he called the day before Thanksgiving, this is Alan Peacock.

34:19.165 --> 34:22.850
I want you and your family to have a wonderful Thanksgiving tomorrow.

34:22.870 --> 34:23.771
I'm buying your book.

34:24.772 --> 34:29.799
And I well up when I even think about it.

34:29.819 --> 34:33.904
It was really a fabulous day because we had been wandering the wilderness, I think, for a long time.

34:34.222 --> 34:38.229
nine months, 13 months, whatever it was, who in the world is going to publish this book?

34:38.790 --> 34:40.873
He said, there's just one question I have to ask.

34:40.914 --> 34:41.615
And I said, what's that?

34:41.635 --> 34:42.576
He said, what's wrong with it?

34:43.258 --> 34:46.223
You know, because it had been with Random House and they'd sent it back.

34:46.283 --> 34:48.246
Random House was about to publish it.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.213
It had already been listed in the catalog.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.332
But I was an orphan.

34:54.372 --> 35:06.671
Have you ever been an orphan, John, where you had an editor who acquired you and left and went someplace else, and now you don't have anyone being your champion.

35:06.691 --> 35:12.099
So I actually, by the time my second book was published, I had had nine different editors.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.502
Three editors along that.

35:14.662 --> 35:15.423
It's just amazing.

35:15.944 --> 35:17.847
But anyway, Alan published Gentleman.

35:18.282 --> 35:23.090
One of the reasons it's a scarce book today is that they didn't have that much confidence that it would sell.

35:23.490 --> 35:29.680
So the first printing was 5,800 copies, which thankfully sold out within a few days.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.207
We had three printings within the first month of publication in 1995.

35:34.307 --> 35:36.350
It was a pretty interesting run.

35:36.791 --> 35:43.041
But I do have to say we talk about the Internet and how it has changed the book world.

35:43.342 --> 35:58.198
For me, as a collector, certainly it's changed things, but as a journalist, as a writer, and as a chronicler of this book world, it hasn't changed a thing, except that I can now do searches and using LexisNexis or whatever.

35:59.379 --> 36:05.445
But as a person who really wants to go out and get book stories, I still feel that I have to go out and meet the people I'm going to write about.

36:05.465 --> 36:08.929
I have to go out and handle the goods, see the collections.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.673
It's still very much a tactile exercise for me.

36:13.210 --> 36:16.595
That's the only way I know how to write stories.

36:16.615 --> 36:18.038
There's one story I do like to tell.

36:18.098 --> 36:19.981
We talk about a tale from the trail.

36:20.441 --> 36:22.084
I like to tell it.

36:22.104 --> 36:29.836
It's about a collector by the name of William Scheide, who I would suggest is probably the greatest living book collector in the world.

36:30.918 --> 36:32.340
I write about him in Gentle Madness.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.802
He's still quite alive.

36:33.822 --> 36:34.623
He's in his nineties.

36:34.643 --> 36:36.366
He's a third generation collector.

36:37.122 --> 36:45.392
His library is so extraordinary, it is on the campus of Princeton University in Firestone Library in a little room all by itself.

36:45.773 --> 36:46.694
He owns the building.

36:46.794 --> 36:48.456
Princeton is very clever.

36:49.077 --> 36:54.964
They figure that however old the books are, however long Mr. Shaggy lives, the books will last longer.

36:55.545 --> 37:00.211
And at some point, maybe, this has not been disclosed, the books will go to Princeton.

37:00.231 --> 37:06.218
But it still very much remains a private collection, but it's in Firestone Library.

37:06.586 --> 37:13.613
I devoted a whole chapter to Bill Scheide and Gentle Madness because I couldn't see who else you could even put with him in this one chapter.

37:13.633 --> 37:16.176
There are chapters where I write about three or four different collectors.

37:16.776 --> 37:17.277
They're fine.

37:17.297 --> 37:18.578
They work in one chapter.

37:18.638 --> 37:20.300
For Scheide, he had to be alone.

37:21.401 --> 37:26.506
I went to see him a couple of times at the library at Princeton, in the Firestone Library.

37:26.727 --> 37:29.830
There's one moment I'll never forget.

37:29.870 --> 37:34.855
He walked over to this old stand-up safe that had been his grandfather's.

37:35.527 --> 37:42.817
He was in his 80s at that point and he was struggling with the door and lifting up and removing this big clamshell box.

37:43.698 --> 37:51.329
I offered to help him with the box and he very gruffly said, you go sit down over there, I'll be right over.

37:51.349 --> 37:54.153
It was a reading table and I said, yes sir, okay.

37:54.173 --> 38:02.985
I went over, I sat down and he came over, he opened up this box and then revealed to me what I knew instantly was his copy of the Gutenberg Bible.

38:03.623 --> 38:10.952
in its original 15th century binding, one of only two in private hands in the world.

38:11.032 --> 38:21.926
As I say, these are books that I could never hope to own, but what he was doing was opening and revealing to me and inviting me to touch where metal type had hidden into paper for the first time.

38:21.966 --> 38:27.072
Now, I record everything, as you can see, everything that I'm allowed to, and I put it certainly on my interviews.

38:28.494 --> 38:30.677
You can go back to this day and listen to that tape

38:31.130 --> 38:35.155
hear all of a sudden this elderly voice saying, are you okay?

38:38.519 --> 38:42.964
And you will hear me say, forgive me, sir, I am a bit lightheaded.

38:44.426 --> 38:53.797
And I will continue by saying, and I said, it isn't often that I am allowed to touch a person's Gutenberg Bible.

38:53.817 --> 38:55.078
He liked that, and he said that

38:55.278 --> 38:56.680
Oh, Rodgers started it.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.883
Harvard would let you handle his anytime.

39:01.226 --> 39:03.649
And I said, no, Rodgers is a friend of mine, actually.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.850
And he's already said no.

39:08.495 --> 39:10.598
And that Gutenberg Bible is not Rodgers.

39:10.618 --> 39:11.419
It's Harvard's.

39:11.459 --> 39:12.080
This is yours.

39:12.320 --> 39:16.566
And I guess the point is, my wife Connie and I will travel.

39:16.746 --> 39:19.429
Really, we will go anywhere to see a great book.

39:19.469 --> 39:20.411
This was only Princeton.

39:20.431 --> 39:22.213
This was only a couple hundred miles away.

39:22.750 --> 39:27.357
We've traveled to Venice to go to the bibliothèque, the St.

39:27.377 --> 39:31.803
Mark's Library, the Marziana, just really to see the books of Cardinal Busserian.

39:31.823 --> 39:45.763
He was the Greek bishop who fled at the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and he carried out all these wonderful cortices documenting ancient Greek literature.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.927
He was a humanist, actually, and then he converted to the Catholic Church.

39:49.295 --> 39:49.936
It's amazing.

39:49.956 --> 39:54.382
I'm Greek-American, so I can say it's how they will bear a pledge after 500 years.

39:54.883 --> 40:03.656
I went up to Mount Athos for a chapter in Patience and Borgia just to see these books that have been preserved and saved in these monastic libraries for a thousand years.

40:04.297 --> 40:06.300
And one of the monks said to me, well, where have you been?

40:06.340 --> 40:10.105
I said, oh, I went to see Bassarian's books two months ago in Venice.

40:10.125 --> 40:10.947
He said, the traitor.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.353
He was still the traitor because he had converted from...

40:15.653 --> 40:19.797
It's amazing.

40:19.817 --> 40:25.703
But we went to Venice really just to hold and to handle this one 7th century codex.

40:25.723 --> 40:29.567
It's the oldest, the earliest known copy of Homer that has come down to it.

40:29.587 --> 40:33.491
Now, of course, it's not the oldest text, but it's the oldest surviving text.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.735
You have some of these marginalia, these annotations in the margins.

40:37.775 --> 40:41.899
There are references to books that themselves don't even exist anymore.

40:41.919 --> 40:45.643
But here is this, and it's vellum, of course, and you can see where it's been handled

40:45.809 --> 40:51.261
You can just wonder and imagine whose fingers have handled this book.

40:51.281 --> 40:52.423
And that's a kick, traveling.

40:52.443 --> 40:53.526
Of course, Venice is nice.

40:53.546 --> 40:58.937
I mean, my wife said, I'll go to Venice with you and go visit that library.

40:59.058 --> 41:04.830
In February, I traveled to Chicago on a day trip, one day, just to go out and see one book.

41:05.401 --> 41:17.421
There's a chapter in my new book, A Splendor of Letters, where I talk about discards and books that have been deaccessioned, books that are sold off and carved up for their engravings.

41:17.661 --> 41:32.505
I write about the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, which just a year or two ago sold off, which up to that point was arguably the finest collection of horticultural and botanic books in the United States, and to raise $6 million to

41:32.958 --> 42:00.822
their spring flower show and to fix the leaky room and using the excuse that nobody comes to see these books anymore they sold off all of these remarkable books they were saying well most of them will go to collective they'll go to institutional collections they won't be broken up but this very astute librarian at the chicago botanic garden had put out the word among his bookseller friends and he gave them a list of titles if you see any of these books show up cannibalized let me know

42:01.392 --> 42:07.019
He did, he found one book, one of only eight copies in institutional libraries in the world.

42:07.059 --> 42:13.668
You know, we say the Audubon elephant folios, there were 46 copies in institutional libraries.

42:13.688 --> 42:16.912
Exceedingly rare book, but not a particularly scarce book.

42:16.932 --> 42:21.418
I mean, that is a concept that is hard sometimes to impress upon people.

42:21.478 --> 42:24.382
The first folio Shakespeare, were there 250 of those?

42:24.742 --> 42:26.645
There were 80 alone at the Folger Library.

42:26.665 --> 42:29.829
Well, it's not a scarce book, but it certainly is a very rare book.

42:29.849 --> 42:30.910
But this particular book,

42:31.261 --> 42:35.747
It's an 18th century illustrated book on plants, on fruit-bearing trees.

42:36.327 --> 42:44.718
It has to be the title, but it's a long German title, and I think it's the Nuremberg Hesperides of the short form.

42:44.738 --> 42:50.525
Only one copy of New England, and yet the Horticultural Society had sold it for $50,000.

42:50.805 --> 42:54.670
It sold at Christie's, and within months,

42:55.038 --> 42:58.764
The cannibalized copy had shown up in England.

42:58.985 --> 43:06.136
All of the plates, 258 plates, were gone and had been colored, by the way, and they're selling on the internet now for $1,500 each.

43:06.637 --> 43:10.884
But I went to Chicago just to see, to pay my respects to this one book.

43:10.904 --> 43:16.113
I mean, you go to see a beautiful book, but in this instance it was to go and to pay my respects to this book.

43:16.674 --> 43:19.138
And for me, my books, by the way, are never done.

43:19.473 --> 43:31.087
I have to say one thing about writing nonfiction books, even though they have already appeared between hardcovers and they've been published, and while you're still working on the next one, it all remains a work in progress for me.

43:31.107 --> 43:36.173
I'm continually interested in the collectors I write about, the booksellers I meet, the librarians.

43:36.574 --> 43:38.436
I want to know how everyone is doing.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.539
I've never finished with them.

43:40.559 --> 43:48.028
So even though I had written about the Horticultural Society, a blender of letters, and that book was out, I still went to Chicago to see the book.

43:48.329 --> 43:54.876
came back, wrote an op-ed piece for the Boston Globe, timed it to appear a week before the Spring Flower Show in Boston.

43:55.857 --> 43:56.899
And it's on our website.

43:56.919 --> 43:57.639
Take a look.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.541
NicholasBasbane.com.

43:59.561 --> 44:00.683
There's a click down there.

44:00.703 --> 44:04.687
I took a big picture of this book that had just been raped.

44:04.707 --> 44:09.412
I hate to use that verb, but the book had been totally abused.

44:09.432 --> 44:12.236
And there has never been a facsimile published of this book.

44:12.596 --> 44:17.121
So even just getting the text at the Chicago Botanic Garden was important.

44:17.675 --> 44:29.031
There are the wonderful aspects of collecting, but there are also these shameful aspects, and I feel it's my responsibility and my pleasure to talk about them.

44:29.091 --> 44:34.979
I don't know if that has to do with a tale from the trail, but it's one of them.

44:34.999 --> 44:36.481
That's a great tale from the trail.

44:37.623 --> 44:40.627
I love this stuff.

44:40.647 --> 44:41.428
I wish I knew it.

44:41.548 --> 44:42.390
I wish I'd seen it.

44:42.690 --> 44:46.956
I wish I could walk in his shoes for a while and see what he's seen.

44:48.050 --> 44:54.338
But most of my turf is far more common.

44:54.358 --> 45:09.436
The East 17th or whatever the street was, thrift store, where I went in and picked up a copy of the Recognitions by William Gattis, signed copy, for 65 cents.

45:11.599 --> 45:13.141
It's a $400 or $500 book, even then.

45:13.161 --> 45:17.466
And when you do that, it lights up your life.

45:17.800 --> 45:23.445
I don't know, especially when you have rent to pay, which I always had.

45:25.086 --> 45:38.057
I remember finding books that, this is one of my favorite tales from the trail.

45:38.818 --> 45:39.959
This was not long ago.

45:40.519 --> 45:43.061
In fact, I think Lois was there.

45:43.081 --> 45:47.385
We were having a bookseller's lunch out of North Denver.

45:48.361 --> 45:58.210
And we were all sitting around grousing, griping, about how bad it's gotten, about how you can't find anything anymore.

45:58.230 --> 45:59.592
This is what booksellers do.

46:00.753 --> 46:01.253
They gripe.

46:04.056 --> 46:06.438
When I was on the racetrack, racetrackers griped.

46:09.261 --> 46:12.204
When I was at the Denver Post, newspaper people griped.

46:12.444 --> 46:15.567
But booksellers seemed to have their own level of griping.

46:15.918 --> 46:22.027
And we were all, about a dozen of us, sitting around the table talking about how the Internet has dried everything up.

46:22.087 --> 46:23.008
You can't find stuff.

46:24.690 --> 46:27.494
And we headed across North Denver.

46:28.115 --> 46:34.725
Pardon me if some of you have heard this story, but it's one of my favorite stories at the trail.

46:37.208 --> 46:42.195
And we drove past this thrift store where I pulled out lots and lots of books.

46:43.036 --> 46:48.324
I've got a friend, by the way, who's a book dealer of some note, and he says, I know what you do in those places.

46:48.985 --> 46:51.209
He says, I've never been able to find anything in there.

46:51.269 --> 46:53.552
Plus, you go in there and it smells.

46:53.913 --> 46:59.842
It smells like I've used hospitals, you know, mattresses and stuff.

47:00.764 --> 47:02.567
And I said, well, you know.

47:02.587 --> 47:04.149
So I tell him this story.

47:04.910 --> 47:11.220
So we walk in the Trish store, and there's four book scouts, at least.

47:11.808 --> 47:18.419
hanging there like vampires, waiting for the woman to come out and put the books out.

47:18.539 --> 47:23.667
And this particular place has got this fierce woman.

47:24.829 --> 47:26.752
She's got a... I hope she's got hair.

47:29.937 --> 47:37.710
Because if I've ever come close to being afraid of a woman, she is a... She's got a stud through her face.

47:37.730 --> 47:38.912
Face-sealed bolt.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.937
I've never been able to understand that.

47:43.439 --> 47:50.248
And the book scouts would kind of edge close to the tray as she put them out.

47:50.268 --> 47:55.414
And if one of them leaned over a little further, she would say, don't do that.

47:55.595 --> 47:57.657
Don't touch the books until I get them on the shelf.

47:57.757 --> 48:01.642
And boy, move back.

48:01.662 --> 48:04.166
And we got there and we started working this store.

48:04.246 --> 48:06.148
She was just rolling the cart back

48:08.542 --> 48:09.323
safe now.

48:10.505 --> 48:12.007
And we did it fast.

48:12.047 --> 48:12.768
We walked down.

48:13.128 --> 48:14.370
She's looking on one shelf.

48:14.490 --> 48:15.432
I'm looking on the other.

48:15.452 --> 48:20.378
And we get to the end and there's a copy of The Water's Wide by Pat Conroy.

48:21.119 --> 48:23.443
And I crack it like this.

48:23.463 --> 48:25.425
And she said, oh, it's going to be a book club edition.

48:25.465 --> 48:27.809
And I said, no, no, trade edition.

48:27.829 --> 48:28.970
She said, how do you know?

48:29.030 --> 48:31.714
And I said, because the book club edition

48:32.150 --> 48:34.292
And I start giving a seminar right there.

48:35.113 --> 48:40.679
The Book Club edition had dark red paper-covered boards on the spine, paper-covered spine.

48:41.861 --> 48:44.964
The trade edition had cloth on the spine.

48:44.984 --> 48:49.168
And I could look right down inside the dust jacket and see that it was a trade edition.

48:50.350 --> 48:53.433
And I said, there were, however, several printings.

48:54.895 --> 48:57.938
And she said, well, there is a way to find out, but it is.

48:58.407 --> 49:00.129
You could open it up and look.

49:01.731 --> 49:07.838
I'm afraid at this point to open and look, because I know the first printing is really more prolific than the later prints.

49:07.918 --> 49:10.861
It's typical of any other book, including Book to Die.

49:10.901 --> 49:18.029
They did a reasonably small first printing, and then they did smaller additional printings.

49:18.049 --> 49:23.215
So I open it up, then it's a first edition, and I closed it like this, and I said, yes, there is a god.

49:23.235 --> 49:26.038
And I took two books off the shelf and put them on the top of it.

49:26.859 --> 49:28.060
I'm walking along, and

49:28.310 --> 49:30.072
The book scouts, of course, are still there.

49:30.612 --> 49:32.574
This is not at all lost on them.

49:33.815 --> 49:38.699
And one of them comes over to me and says, that was a good one, wasn't it?

49:38.719 --> 49:42.303
And I said, yeah, it actually was pretty good.

49:42.403 --> 49:44.645
And he said, how good was it?

49:45.165 --> 49:46.767
And I said, pretty good.

49:48.128 --> 49:53.913
And I thought, well, you know, if I tell him, he's going to hate me.

49:54.093 --> 49:56.696
But he hates me anyway, so I might as well tell him.

49:56.716 --> 49:58.097
And he said, it's about $1,000.

49:58.853 --> 50:00.896
And he said, and his face turned white.

50:01.136 --> 50:03.219
And he said, I had it in my hand.

50:03.259 --> 50:04.581
I had it in my hand.

50:04.641 --> 50:06.243
I carried it all over the store.

50:07.264 --> 50:11.349
And I thought, Pat Conroy, who cares?

50:12.711 --> 50:16.756
You know, I've got five copies of Beach Music that I can't sell.

50:17.658 --> 50:19.760
And I said, this is not the same animal.

50:19.780 --> 50:22.684
It's just got the same guy's name on it.

50:22.724 --> 50:26.029
There was a 250,000-some printing on that book.

50:26.049 --> 50:27.831
This is a very scarce animal.

50:28.874 --> 50:30.997
So he hates me.

50:31.038 --> 50:32.981
There were a lot of stories like that.

50:33.321 --> 50:36.166
Not quite as much fun as that one.

50:36.226 --> 50:42.516
I think to be a good book scout you also have to have a twist of perversity in your soul.

50:43.438 --> 50:44.680
The agony of defeat.

50:45.101 --> 50:46.403
The thrill of victory.

50:47.044 --> 50:53.194
I found books in thrift stores that paid the rent.

50:53.765 --> 50:59.943
And that's the particular kit when you are trying to scrape it up every month and get it together.

50:59.983 --> 51:04.416
Our tales of the trail are very different.

51:04.936 --> 51:07.381
Richard is lurking.

51:07.481 --> 51:10.326
I know the look of a lurk when I see him.

51:10.346 --> 51:13.712
He looks like one of those book shouts I was telling him.

51:13.732 --> 51:16.517
Hang there like a vampire waiting to pounce on you.

51:16.838 --> 51:20.304
You're not going to forgive me for that story are you John?

51:20.525 --> 51:23.711
That was not you, but it might have been.

51:24.212 --> 51:25.714
A few minutes for questions.

51:25.735 --> 51:26.556
Okay.

51:27.633 --> 51:55.632
back there we'll come here in a second um he's asking about i think my final actually i think you're probably talking about my emily dickinson which is uh i i oh the legends actually that's the jeffrey crayon which is the uh washington that that i really didn't find that had belonged to uh

51:55.966 --> 51:57.749
a kind of a mentor of mine.

51:58.309 --> 52:02.315
And among The Gently Met, I do write about the importance of having a mentor.

52:02.415 --> 52:11.749
I think that because so much of this is not codified and there is so much wisdom to pass on if you can latch on to somebody who is willing to share.

52:12.190 --> 52:14.693
And this was a person who did teach me a lot.

52:14.773 --> 52:21.663
And when he died, his books went off to a little sale above a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

52:21.703 --> 52:22.885
I mean, it was not a big sale.

52:23.371 --> 52:34.164
And there were booksellers who came, and here was the sketchbooks of Geoffrey Crayon, which they were all interested, of course, there were more modern first editions, and this thing went for like 10 bucks.

52:34.644 --> 52:39.550
And I was able to, because I knew this was my friend's library, I was able to get it.

52:39.570 --> 52:43.515
But I think you're also asking about, you never know, do you, John?

52:43.555 --> 52:49.902
You're up there in North Worcester County and Central Massachusetts, and there's a yard sale.

52:50.405 --> 52:54.591
An elderly woman has a box, among other items, out in her yard.

52:54.611 --> 53:02.242
She has a box lot of 14 books, 12 of which are probably worth 25 cents, but marked $10 each.

53:02.823 --> 53:07.971
Two of which are probably worth considerably more, also marked $10 each.

53:08.632 --> 53:10.915
And I have to say, as a sport, I bought them all.

53:11.136 --> 53:15.382
I think there were 20 books, because I gave them $200.

53:16.423 --> 53:19.568
But the one, there were two in there, really, but of course, the

53:19.885 --> 53:28.677
Emily Dickinson's first series, 18, was it 90 or 90, whatever it is, knowing instantly what it was, I have to say.

53:28.737 --> 53:32.381
And then people have said to me, didn't you feel terrible doing that to that little old lady?

53:32.942 --> 53:34.785
And I said, I paid her price.

53:34.905 --> 53:37.989
I mean, really, we should discuss this at some point.

53:38.349 --> 53:40.793
If the price is, I didn't try to beat her down, right?

53:41.133 --> 53:44.537
And I bought everything that was in the box a lot, and I thought I was being a sport.

53:45.118 --> 53:46.500
I think you were a great sport.

53:46.666 --> 53:48.949
to buy the whole, really, right?

53:48.969 --> 53:57.778
And whatever I didn't keep, I gave to the Goddard Library, and they probably sold them for two bucks at 50 cents each, and she was very happy with the $200.

53:57.798 --> 54:15.778
The rule of thumb in the book trade is if they invite you to their house and ask you to give them what it's worth, you're honor-bound and obligated to give them your best shot, consistent with your rent and your budget and all that stuff.

54:16.315 --> 54:23.946
On the other hand, if they put it out for a price, whether it's in a bookstore or yard sale, and I find it, it's mine.

54:24.748 --> 54:32.018
I mean, there was a former track of smoke I told that story to, and he said, if you go to hell, that's going to be the reason.

54:32.179 --> 54:38.388
We're going to hell.

54:38.408 --> 54:39.910
We're all going.

54:41.999 --> 54:43.261
There was a question over here.

54:43.281 --> 54:43.962
Yes, sir.

54:43.982 --> 54:45.444
A question for both of you.

54:45.464 --> 54:52.755
What's the most unusual or valuable or strange thing you've ever found inserted in a book from a previous owner?

54:52.995 --> 54:54.137
I don't have a book from.

54:54.537 --> 54:54.898
Something.

54:55.078 --> 55:01.027
He's asking what's the most valuable thing inserted in a book from a prior owner.

55:01.928 --> 55:08.057
I can't say that I found anything other than I like books that have annotations in them.

55:08.290 --> 55:09.271
Do you mean like a letter?

55:09.772 --> 55:10.493
No, not for me.

55:10.553 --> 55:13.217
No, I can't say that I have, actually.

55:13.878 --> 55:14.679
I wish I could say.

55:14.699 --> 55:17.062
I haven't found anything except in my own imagination.

55:17.463 --> 55:21.389
I mean, nothing that I would wish that were there.

55:22.009 --> 55:27.878
I did find a book one time with a heart drawn in it.

55:28.038 --> 55:32.084
And the reason I mention this is because the book itself was not worth much of anything.

55:32.564 --> 55:37.892
And somebody in 1901 or something had apparently secreted a

55:38.969 --> 55:43.215
a secret message to his lover in this heart.

55:44.317 --> 55:50.246
And there was a little note to that effect, and somebody had slit it with a razor and plucked the note out of it.

55:50.666 --> 55:51.488
That's kind of intriguing.

55:51.508 --> 55:53.831
Oh, that's pretty good.

55:54.732 --> 55:56.115
But what it said, I don't know.

55:56.976 --> 56:02.164
Probably said, they'll meet you down in Kentucky Fried Chicken.

56:02.184 --> 56:03.846
No wonder you're not writing romance.

56:04.147 --> 56:33.124
no wonder you're not writing romance I am writing romance I have to say when I hear a novelist say he got mad at a book scout and he says I'm going to write a novel and I'm going to kill him off I can't do that as a nonfiction writer I continually write about books and book culture and I was on a panel last year at the Miami Book Fair and Carolyn C was there she was talking about her father who had been a

56:33.458 --> 56:37.764
a pornographer who wrote 70 pornographic novels under a pseudonym.

56:38.285 --> 56:39.968
And I said, well, how the heck can I talk that?

56:40.068 --> 56:47.158
So I did say, you know, the closest I will ever come to writing a love scene, I mean, here I am writing books about books.

56:47.178 --> 56:49.021
And I do have a page in Among the Gently Red.

56:49.061 --> 56:50.183
I checked it out this morning.

56:50.203 --> 56:52.085
It's pages 69 and 70.

56:52.686 --> 56:53.868
I said, this is it.

56:53.888 --> 56:59.697
This is as close as I will ever come to writing a love scene in the book, where I talk about the tactility.

56:59.757 --> 57:01.980
I mean, what is it about

57:02.382 --> 57:08.342
the erotic qualities of, and I can't paraphrase it, don't ask me to, but I do know I read it

57:08.677 --> 57:10.519
at the Miami Book Fair and I blushed.

57:10.719 --> 57:13.642
And it was colorized.

57:13.762 --> 57:15.464
It was on C-Span.

57:15.484 --> 57:18.607
My wife said to me, you really shouldn't have done that.

57:18.627 --> 57:21.149
Shouldn't have read that section very well.

57:21.169 --> 57:21.710
What is it?

57:21.770 --> 57:25.093
People say, what is it that drives you crazy about a book?

57:25.113 --> 57:26.835
I mean, we feel it.

57:26.855 --> 57:27.596
We smoke it.

57:27.616 --> 57:28.537
We caress it.

57:28.897 --> 57:30.779
We fill our lungs with the aroma.

57:30.799 --> 57:31.760
I mean, we get dizzy.

57:31.780 --> 57:33.321
We get weak meat.

57:33.361 --> 57:36.945
So I am paraphrasing it.

57:37.634 --> 57:56.241
to this day feel that way, because I still get review books, for instance, that come in the mail, and I'll see a big box from Yale, they do wonderful art books, or the Getty Center, they do, and I'll say, oh, and I'll open it up, and it'll be a beautiful book on El Greco or something, and you get that weak-kneed feeling.

57:56.261 --> 58:00.807
Actually, you could write a book, a non-vision book, about a murderer.

58:01.495 --> 58:03.338
But you would have to kill the guy.

58:03.518 --> 58:11.530
Or hire some... You wouldn't have no motive for doing this, so that's pretty good.

58:11.550 --> 58:16.578
You'd hire somebody who'd come and knock this guy off, just so you could write a book about it.

58:16.658 --> 58:19.743
Wouldn't that be cool?

58:20.023 --> 58:22.187
Be careful, he's from the Boston area.

58:23.469 --> 58:27.455
Do you have one parting word you want to give everybody?

58:27.475 --> 58:28.937
Because we're going to have to close it.

58:29.153 --> 58:57.726
thank you for coming it's a wonderful time this is the greatest bookstore in the state today there's lots of books out there and if you look at something that you really wanted and you say that's too much money remember me with my graves of wrath too much money and now that's starting to look pretty good it goes up those kind of books that are 50 years old and dwindling the value keeps going up it doesn't go down

58:59.022 --> 58:59.766
for what it's worth.

59:00.771 --> 59:04.813
I want to say thank you to the dean of bibliophiles and to the dean of bibliophiles.
