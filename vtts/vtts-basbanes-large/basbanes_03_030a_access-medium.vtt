WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:05.571
Well, I'm working now.

00:05.591 --> 00:06.152
I got it going.

00:06.532 --> 00:07.714
Oh, good.

00:07.734 --> 00:12.159
And so briefly, just for my tape recording, give us your full name so we have it on the tape.

00:12.279 --> 00:12.659
Oh, sure.

00:12.740 --> 00:13.541
Ronald Schleicher.

00:15.963 --> 00:21.850
And you were telling my wife some fascinating things about how you work with physicians who are also writers.

00:22.511 --> 00:22.971
Yeah.

00:23.472 --> 00:27.777
Part of what we were talking about last night is

00:28.887 --> 00:54.102
uh what they find and they've tested to find this is as students progress through medical school they become worse and worse at listening to patients at listening yes and and in fact at the oklahoma medical school but many of them do this when freshman medical students come in before they start classes they have them interview simulated patients and they record

00:54.318 --> 01:00.135
their skills in obtaining information, and they do this every year, and every year they get worse.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.775
The first two years are courses, the second two years are clinical work.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.333
Through this clinical use, this third and fourth year, they did worse and worse.

01:10.893 --> 01:18.042
And so we've designed this class, and now we're designing this project to try to teach doctors to listen better.

01:18.362 --> 01:22.708
And the way to do it is to involve them in literature.

01:22.728 --> 01:22.948
Wow.

01:23.188 --> 01:25.150
And what precisely do you teach?

01:25.170 --> 01:27.373
Why don't you tell me a little bit about what your background is?

01:27.573 --> 01:33.761
Oh, my background is I have a degree in English in modern literature.

01:33.781 --> 01:35.783
Wrote my thesis, my dissertation on Yates.

01:36.286 --> 01:38.409
But I've done a million things.

01:38.689 --> 01:40.371
I'm part of the Fund of English.

01:40.471 --> 01:41.332
You can do whatever you want.

01:41.653 --> 01:44.616
So this is not really a medical kind of a thing for you.

01:44.697 --> 01:48.381
Well, it's become a medical thing because I've worked for six years.

01:48.481 --> 01:57.533
Jerry and I have taught classes here on the campus and at the Health Science Center up in the city to medical students and pre-medical students.

01:58.474 --> 02:00.336
In fact, Jerry even bought me a white coat.

02:00.485 --> 02:02.348
That's great.

02:02.388 --> 02:08.055
He told me if I were in the hospital, I'd be pounding our chest.

02:10.278 --> 02:11.760
But it's wonderful.

02:11.780 --> 02:15.345
I mean, these are the brightest and among the most motivated students you'll ever meet.

02:15.826 --> 02:17.088
And they want to be good doctors.

02:17.728 --> 02:19.551
And there's something about medical education.

02:19.571 --> 02:21.654
We could talk about this a little bit.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.296
Because I think we can specify what it is.

02:23.596 --> 02:29.985
But there's something about medical education that teaches people

02:30.252 --> 02:34.558
They don't have to interact with patients.

02:35.119 --> 02:40.427
But to get back to something you said earlier, why were they getting worse and worse every year?

02:40.447 --> 02:46.636
What was going on that they were regressing?

02:46.817 --> 02:47.938
There are lots of speculations.

02:48.239 --> 02:54.488
My educated sense is that—this is my office here—

02:55.075 --> 02:57.358
I like this.

02:57.618 --> 02:58.099
It's fine.

02:58.119 --> 02:59.841
I'm very comfortable here.

03:01.123 --> 03:10.916
It gets worse and worse because the nature of medical education is positive science.

03:12.118 --> 03:16.664
And they're taught without having to interact with other people.

03:16.684 --> 03:21.370
I mean, probably the course like this, which we've been teaching, is there's so much information

03:21.873 --> 03:23.616
medical students need to learn.

03:23.976 --> 03:29.505
So whose idea was it to bring an English professor into the medical school?

03:29.665 --> 03:35.154
It was Jerry Veneta, the dean of the college.

03:35.174 --> 03:43.307
Well, and I'll show you the—let me take off my jacket and I'll show you because it's on the computer.

03:44.519 --> 03:48.964
Look at the cow, Greg.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.247
My son took the cow.

03:51.528 --> 03:53.610
What kind of old is he?

03:53.630 --> 03:54.131
He's 20.

03:54.391 --> 03:56.794
I mean, he's no child.

03:56.954 --> 04:00.839
Well, that 20-year-old does the same kind of thing.

04:01.059 --> 04:05.224
Well, I've got a polar bear in mine, which is kind of funny.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.268
So we've probably got about 15 minutes, I would think, right?

04:08.288 --> 04:08.869
Yeah.

04:08.889 --> 04:10.991
She said she's going to come at quarter, too.

04:11.232 --> 04:11.472
Okay.

04:11.492 --> 04:12.774
Are they going to come here?

04:12.894 --> 04:13.094
Yeah.

04:13.194 --> 04:13.494
Oh, okay.

04:13.515 --> 04:13.935
To pick you up.

04:14.540 --> 04:20.266
In fact, I just made a presentation.

04:20.286 --> 04:21.206
This is chapter two.

04:21.427 --> 04:27.052
This is the small company up in Tulsa who are doing the technique.

04:27.072 --> 04:29.675
This is the table of contents.

04:29.755 --> 04:32.317
And this is the chapter we have here on the patient's story.

04:37.522 --> 04:43.568
The story a patient brings to the physician is usually among the first and most important information that healthcare workers encounter.

04:44.155 --> 04:54.330
These stories, narrated by the patient or, in special cases by others, present information organized in particular ways that call from particular times in which we're going to call ourselves again.

04:54.350 --> 04:59.777
...the patient-physician relationship, and that help define the scope of healing and care in particular cases.

05:00.418 --> 05:02.481
Here, I mean, there's some wonderful things here.

05:02.642 --> 05:09.131
We've been here, although I won't go through the whole thing with a quote by William Carlin, as well as a great writer who was a physician.

05:09.251 --> 05:10.272
Right.

05:10.293 --> 05:13.437
And we've interviewed a mess of people, including Oliver Sacks,

05:13.720 --> 05:24.592
But this is John Stone, who's a cardiologist at Emory, and we're contracted to have it done by October.

05:24.612 --> 05:26.895
I mean, this is my favorite.

05:26.915 --> 05:37.467
John came to Oklahoma City, and we've made him... Graduation at Emory University School of Medicine in 1982 with OEM is...

05:37.868 --> 05:44.278
after Christopher Smart, so constructed about his cat, Geoffrey.

05:44.919 --> 06:01.484
I just want to read the last part of this, but I want to underscore first that Gaudium Sagatur is an old medieval Latin drinking song, which many of you will have sung at graduation.

06:01.604 --> 06:04.028
It means, therefore, let us rejoice.

06:04.497 --> 06:33.863
story will come to you like hunger like thirst for you will know the answer like second nature like thirst for the patient will live and you will try to understand for you will be amazed the patient will not live and you will try to understand for you will be baffled for you will try to explain both either to the family for there will be laying on of hands and the letting go

06:34.855 --> 06:38.239
was what death would always intend if it had the choice.

06:39.300 --> 06:46.449
For the fever will drop, the bone remold along its lines of force, a speech will tremble itself.

06:50.734 --> 06:56.420
So each chapter opens up with half a dozen people who calls.

06:57.161 --> 07:02.247
We spoke to Robert Calls, and on the other hand,

07:02.513 --> 07:29.331
our plan is now that we're good ways along we're going to get back in touch with him because we quote from his work with all of stories and one of the things even if we can't get him on camera i bet you i'm morally certain this beginning just talks about um uh patient stories and important and one of the ways this functions when we're done it'll run about eight or nine hours the whole thing is about narrative and storytelling literature and patience

07:29.665 --> 07:39.340
In fact, one of the things we have, we have a search engine with different kinds of attention afforded by literature and narrative.

07:42.145 --> 07:50.178
Reading this down here is part of what we're going to do is create what's called continuing medical education.

07:50.799 --> 07:53.563
We need to take 150 hours every three years.

07:53.645 --> 07:56.868
schools all over the country offer courses of one story or another.

07:58.650 --> 08:05.336
Both Howard Medical College and Penn, who's publishing this, and Columbia, her name is Rita Sharon.

08:07.158 --> 08:21.812
But one of the things, this chapter is called Narrative Knowledge, and one of the aims of this DVD is to find, since they were 13, to get into medical school, that there are other people, for instance,

08:22.552 --> 08:35.483
So here's the screen, although it's ugly, we're going to change it, about narrative knowledge, and then we hyperlink it to a mess of stuff about Descartes.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.466
Here's a screen on Descartes.

08:38.486 --> 08:41.629
We hired this company, and we're just working closely with them.

08:41.649 --> 08:45.612
So we're just finding images, and they paste them up, and we decide if we like them.

08:45.632 --> 08:48.995
Is this something that you hope to ask them twice in medical schools?

08:49.015 --> 08:50.556
Well, both.

08:50.616 --> 08:51.377
Here's the problem.

08:52.268 --> 08:54.752
Terry says to me, you'd like this.

08:54.852 --> 08:56.374
When you go to medical school, you'll learn.

08:56.895 --> 09:01.842
The students who we've had, I've taught for 25 years.

09:03.525 --> 09:10.014
Can we get medical students to grudge this stuff when they have so much other stuff to learn?

09:10.055 --> 09:18.848
And our medical school could say to second year students, this is what you have to do when you're not taking classes.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.111
It's an AC.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.072
It really is an exciting project.

09:23.112 --> 09:29.181
One of the... So we have this.

09:29.561 --> 09:41.698
We have... What we did is we... Later... We have a good search engine, but later we're going to... The later chapters that you're developing, you can go to a particular page.

09:41.718 --> 09:50.170
I hired two English graduate students to work as our assistant on this to find images.

09:50.572 --> 09:53.455
And one of the things... The following patient positioning.

09:53.475 --> 09:54.816
This is one of our students.

09:54.836 --> 10:00.442
One of the things we've done... I'll just shut this down here.

10:00.662 --> 10:04.366
Enacted a... Do I?

10:04.386 --> 10:04.827
Yes, hi.

10:04.967 --> 10:05.768
I'm Dr. Doraleva.

10:05.788 --> 10:07.069
Yeah.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.110
She tells her story.

10:08.771 --> 10:14.697
I'm here today because your doctor asked me to come and see if I could help figure out what's going on.

10:14.717 --> 10:19.202
It sounds like it's kind of... She has implanted arteries.

10:19.222 --> 10:19.482
That's great.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.129
That he doesn't notice at this point.

10:21.149 --> 10:21.890
He doesn't notice.

10:22.971 --> 10:26.576
And... This hasn't been done.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.920
Well, in fact, this is a case that Jerry knew about.

10:29.940 --> 10:32.203
So... I mean, in terms of the story.

10:32.223 --> 10:33.204
Yeah, in terms of the story, right.

10:33.585 --> 10:41.295
And here we have a copy of... This is what... This is an elaborate one for the students.

10:41.315 --> 10:42.477
So the students can go through this.

10:42.577 --> 10:47.063
It's very standard.

10:47.984 --> 10:48.945
Between patient visits?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.396
I'll go back.

10:50.557 --> 10:51.338
This is terrific.

10:51.438 --> 10:56.745
At the end of this, this thing takes seven minutes, this interview.

10:57.286 --> 11:00.811
At the end of the interview, let's get to it.

11:00.871 --> 11:09.102
Other tests they've already done and what I've learned, I'll be examining you in just a minute and see if we can figure out what's going on.

11:09.122 --> 11:10.684
Well, has he done this?

11:11.045 --> 11:11.205
Yeah.

11:11.225 --> 11:15.050
And at the end of the interview, he gives the dominant discomfort.

11:15.311 --> 11:17.093
Yeah.

11:17.815 --> 11:25.864
I mean, she has fatigue, a low-grade fever, and this is something that really happened with Jerry.

11:25.884 --> 11:26.985
He met this woman.

11:27.005 --> 11:32.572
The story is hilarious, and he saved her life.

11:32.632 --> 11:34.294
I'll just let that go.

11:35.715 --> 11:46.287
But anyway, what we go through here is the patient's history of present illness presents a

11:46.537 --> 11:54.166
What we go through here for the medical students is the ways that, if you understand how many, we have a bunch of sections earlier.

11:55.088 --> 11:56.970
I'm watching the clock.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.191
Sherlock Holmes.

11:59.353 --> 12:00.134
They're going to change that.

12:00.274 --> 12:01.556
It won't say you lose it.

12:01.576 --> 12:08.224
It's a nose search, you lose it.

12:09.886 --> 12:12.409
So we have murders in the Rue Morgue.

12:12.794 --> 12:14.776
Uh, to talk about the text.

12:14.816 --> 12:16.698
Oh, I got the wrong button.

12:18.901 --> 12:20.142
Um, sorry.

12:20.162 --> 12:24.747
Get the sound.

12:25.408 --> 12:30.153
Uh, lots of... He wrote three.

12:30.554 --> 12:35.099
The murders in the room or... Okay, so, and then we have them... Extraordinary murders.

12:35.159 --> 12:35.859
Just read them.

12:35.899 --> 12:37.902
That's why I was asking her about copyright.

12:37.922 --> 12:40.945
...were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific three.

12:41.110 --> 12:54.206
And we have a lot of discussion about the way that the detectives go about their business.

12:57.950 --> 13:00.514
And Conan Doyle, for instance, was a doctor.

13:04.138 --> 13:07.422
And that's the Mishrach Holmes.

13:08.093 --> 13:14.562
A scholar who teaches Northwestern medical humanities talking about the last section of this chapter.

13:14.582 --> 13:17.766
This is just about the patient.

13:18.888 --> 13:23.334
Unwillingly it seems.

13:23.354 --> 13:26.439
Separation seems.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.064
But I guess some of the things I might.

13:30.965 --> 13:34.810
Almost never share my own thoughts with my students.

13:34.870 --> 13:37.594
But I guess some of the things I might.

13:37.996 --> 14:06.805
want to bring out of that poem with students or someone else teaching it would be to think perhaps about the way in which illness is almost never an isolated experience or individual experience that this is a shared experience in the poem between two people who are in love and that

14:07.763 --> 14:34.581
the end of life i think which is visible in the poem uh is something that both people present in the poem must confront and and and so the one issue there i think that would be important the first this is a series of dvds and the first one they did is called red planet about mars in fact my a pal of mine bob markley did this

14:34.831 --> 14:39.297
And three of us are editing this series of DVDs for pen.

14:39.537 --> 14:45.284
And I wanted to give you a copy of this, although ours is much better, because Bob did his on a shoestring.

14:45.324 --> 14:46.305
He's an English professor.

14:46.365 --> 14:51.291
And I found the pot of gold up at the—just in terms of funding.

14:51.872 --> 14:54.776
But— That's important.

14:54.796 --> 14:55.436
Yeah.

14:55.637 --> 15:02.425
And what Bob did is—it took him four years—three years to do this, and he would get $5,000 here and $5,000 there.

15:02.759 --> 15:04.281
And that's something on this scale.

15:04.762 --> 15:06.043
Yeah.

15:06.804 --> 15:09.848
But he started it, and I wish I had an extra copy.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.489
I'll mail you.

15:10.509 --> 15:16.717
If you give me your card, I'll email you, and then we can establish a line of communication.

15:16.738 --> 15:21.043
We have a lot to talk about.

15:21.904 --> 15:22.405
Excellent.

15:24.376 --> 15:25.898
Oh, it's just, and it's so exciting.

15:26.038 --> 15:27.040
I mean, it's, yeah.

15:27.581 --> 15:28.682
Adjunct professor of medicine.

15:28.763 --> 15:29.904
Yeah, yeah, I got an appointment.

15:29.924 --> 15:30.585
Is that something?

15:30.605 --> 15:32.688
He's got a, he's got a position in the medical school.

15:34.131 --> 15:36.274
It's terrific.

15:36.294 --> 15:36.915
It is.

15:36.935 --> 15:37.055
It is.

15:37.075 --> 15:38.737
It's a real thing.

15:38.858 --> 15:40.220
It's fantastic.

15:40.280 --> 15:45.047
And you're pioneering something, I think, too, which is, it has to be done, you know.

15:46.149 --> 15:46.810
Well, it works.

15:46.890 --> 15:49.313
I mean, the students who get encounters with stuff.

15:49.333 --> 15:53.860
We had one young man, I was telling you last night, from Arkansas, a brave medical student.

15:54.397 --> 15:59.644
We took our two-week course, and we read five books, Tenders, The Night.

16:00.706 --> 16:01.066
Come in.

16:03.209 --> 16:04.290
The door should be open, yeah.

16:05.752 --> 16:11.741
I can print out my syllabus.

16:11.841 --> 16:15.466
Anyway, he announces new class in front of other people.

He says, I've doubled the number of books I've written.

16:19.070 --> 16:19.531
Wow.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.173
Hi, Pat.

16:22.595 --> 16:22.896
I know.

16:23.016 --> 16:23.897
We've got a call, right?

16:24.097 --> 16:33.796
I have to miss your talk to Sam.

16:33.816 --> 16:34.457
That's okay.

16:34.477 --> 16:38.325
Well, you've heard everything I've got to say.
