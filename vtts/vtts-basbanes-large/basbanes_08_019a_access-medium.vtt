WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:05.915
Okay, we're talking to Betty Warren.

00:05.935 --> 00:07.919
All right.

00:09.402 --> 00:10.724
You'll clean up my paint hat.

00:10.945 --> 00:18.700
I've done close to a thousand of these in a few years, and I've never had a complaint, I have to say.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.465
The tape recorder is... I used to tape...

00:21.597 --> 00:49.056
no this is curious notes so we're going to actually look into one another which i find that when we're doing on television interviews and you can't i can't see somebody's else's face you get so disconcerted because you're looking at nothing and that's why i hate to do telephone interviews i really don't i try not to do that because i think this is kind of a record exactly and i think you're part of uh

00:49.390 --> 00:52.098
It's not that much of a word sometimes, especially for an interview.

00:52.178 --> 00:59.460
I think, you know, when you write a book, you have a chance to really rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.

00:59.721 --> 01:01.606
This is now your fifth book, I believe.

01:01.847 --> 01:02.910
And I would say that...

01:03.127 --> 01:08.294
The first four were decidedly, in one manner or another, very strongly autobiographical, I think.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.577
Well, actually, it's not.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.282
Well, the children's book are definitely autobiographical.

01:14.303 --> 01:16.185
Well, I mean, there were resonances from your life.

01:16.205 --> 01:17.006
Yes, yes.

01:17.026 --> 01:20.771
Of course, I guess he was kind of a... Yes, exactly, exactly.

01:20.832 --> 01:22.934
And my sister's story.

01:22.954 --> 01:24.236
But you're right.

01:24.276 --> 01:26.940
This is a book that I had...

01:27.427 --> 01:42.889
written, trying to keep the history as far in the background as possible so that it isn't as historical as perhaps Spring Moon was.

01:42.909 --> 01:55.307
And it took almost 15 years from the time I thought of it to now that sometimes now I know that I'm going to be talking about the book, thinking back on it, I hardly even

01:55.642 --> 02:01.281
can find the strands that initiated the story.

02:01.733 --> 02:16.055
I live by this myth that grapefruit just helps me with my diet.

02:17.758 --> 02:22.766
I've been dieting for 20 years, I think.

02:22.786 --> 02:23.547
No, no, no.

02:23.687 --> 02:29.496
I was just saying that as soon as you finish

02:29.712 --> 02:32.195
a first novel, you're thinking of a second novel.

02:33.256 --> 02:40.323
And really, since Spring Moon was published in 1981, I've been thinking about it a long time, off and on with other books.

02:40.403 --> 02:49.733
But nevertheless, you have that challenge of the second novel, which is both frightening and exhilarating.

02:49.753 --> 02:58.302
Well, in some of the interviews I've read that you gave while you were working on Legacies and, of course, while you were posting to Beijing,

02:58.940 --> 03:01.364
It was said that you were working on an artist.

03:01.444 --> 03:02.506
Is this that novel?

03:02.526 --> 03:04.749
This is that novel.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.630
I hate to admit it.

03:05.771 --> 03:12.902
I hate to admit it because it just seems like somehow you feel neuter.

03:13.242 --> 03:16.007
I mean, you always feel nude when you go out there with a novel.

03:16.247 --> 03:20.053
But you feel even neuter because you're older.

03:20.073 --> 03:23.939
The word, by the way, is N-U-D-E.

03:23.959 --> 03:24.520
That's right.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.483
That's spelled by transcription when I...

03:27.104 --> 03:28.065
No, not neuter.

03:28.085 --> 03:34.193
Well, there were times I wrestled with these words, and it certainly helps to spell it.

03:34.213 --> 03:47.951
But if this book has been thinking about it for 15 years or so, where Tiananmen Swear works into this, now how... Well, of course, the problem with thinking about... It's been changing.

03:48.052 --> 03:48.873
It's been changing.

03:48.913 --> 03:50.134
That's one of the problems.

03:50.275 --> 03:55.561
I've written about, I'd say, a fourth of it before I went to Beijing.

03:56.182 --> 03:56.723
And then...

03:57.209 --> 04:05.417
I thought, being quite ignorant, I guess, or hopeful at least, that I would just pick up where I left when I came home.

04:06.097 --> 04:14.605
But of course, having lived in Beijing for four years and growing older and so on and so forth, I came back and realized that I had to start all over again.

04:15.366 --> 04:17.127
That makes for a better book, isn't it?

04:17.147 --> 04:17.748
I think so.

04:17.768 --> 04:25.495
I think because Tiananmen really marked my own thinking and my own life in ways that I...

04:25.998 --> 04:28.023
could have never imagined.

04:29.125 --> 04:34.698
When I went to Beijing, I was much more hopeful about what can be done within the party.

04:34.919 --> 04:39.670
I think every Chinese, that my friends were anyway, they thought that

04:40.139 --> 04:58.922
the party after the Cultural Revolution and everything else that Dung and his cohorts were facing, at least in the direction they may be going slowly, they may be going two steps ahead and one step backwards, but nevertheless they were for the opening and eventually there will be political change.

05:00.604 --> 05:10.095
Then, after my husband's tour was over, I went back to really cover for CBS the Gorbachev

05:11.088 --> 05:15.914
meeting, and then it happened.

05:16.495 --> 05:28.050
And, of course, my experience there during those 40-some odd days was just both inspirational and depressing.

05:28.070 --> 05:31.114
But it was, we should point out, a journalistic assignment.

05:31.294 --> 05:31.474
Yes.

05:31.734 --> 05:34.598
And were you able to...

05:35.050 --> 05:38.378
Because, I mean, one of the tenets of the profession is detachment.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.806
Well, I would not say that I was a journalist.

05:41.866 --> 05:43.710
I would say more that I was a commentator.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.259
So I had a little bit more leeway in terms of emotions.

05:48.041 --> 05:53.734
But what I saw was so unique.

05:54.102 --> 06:04.754
Because even the hardened journalists and the hardened cameramen, you know, usually cameramen, they're not quite interested in seeing, they're looking for that, wonderful pictures.

06:04.774 --> 06:14.264
I used to see them come back from the square, sometimes with tears in their eyes, they were so moved.

06:14.284 --> 06:16.927
So I plead guilty to being involved.

06:18.389 --> 06:22.253
And when I came back and saw the aftermath,

06:22.553 --> 06:25.476
I left on the Tuesday before the tanks rolled.

06:25.997 --> 06:27.198
Tanks rolled on Saturday.

06:28.119 --> 06:30.621
And was reporting from here through the pictures.

06:31.362 --> 06:34.125
And it was such a shock.

06:34.345 --> 06:38.369
It was perhaps again looking backwards.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.391
I should have seen it.

06:40.512 --> 06:52.324
It was in a way inevitable because these people had grown up in a system and their whole attitudes toward force had been there.

06:52.945 --> 06:59.873
And I guess that's what, in many ways, that it seemed to be much more continual than I would have thought.

06:59.913 --> 07:15.011
I would have thought the Cultural Revolution and the break with the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's opening would have softened the kind of reactions to what was definitely a peaceful demonstration, but that was not to be.

07:15.031 --> 07:20.978
So when I came from a moment, I looked at what I had written and decided

07:21.380 --> 07:44.113
start all over again i think that one of the pluses of that certainly as a fiction writer because it is a novel that you having lived with these three principal characters for such a long time you know them you know the histories yes and the artist thing was that i um i had the three characters in mind

07:44.802 --> 07:51.493
And when I went to China, I kept meeting people who had aspects of each character.

07:51.513 --> 08:02.251
And of course, that also gave you a mirror in which to focus on the characters.

08:03.393 --> 08:10.405
And how, for instance, although I'm an opera fan, I'm not an opera expert,

08:10.992 --> 08:24.148
But the training of the stars and how so many of them have really no education, can barely read, which reinforced my thinking.

08:24.168 --> 08:34.401
It is a believable thing that people who have talent can somehow come into a career that is startling.

08:35.258 --> 08:45.190
Since we think of opera as grounded in the culture of Europe and very much the court and so on and so forth.

08:45.210 --> 08:53.480
But it is true, I've met several opera singers who really was trained in the old-fashioned way and who did not have any education.

08:54.361 --> 09:02.751
And their talent is so oral that it met the way in which

09:03.018 --> 09:12.353
they approach it, and even they don't even, many of them don't even understand what they're singing, except they do because of the music, the music.

09:14.235 --> 09:15.077
Yes.

09:15.277 --> 09:26.815
So it's another aspect of a profession or a talent that I don't have, because I was able to

09:27.132 --> 09:29.054
befriend so many people there.

09:29.675 --> 09:34.542
I was able to have them describe to me how they did it.

09:34.562 --> 09:43.032
Are there aspects of the characters, having lived with them now as long as you have, that you know that aren't worth it?

09:43.173 --> 09:51.143
I mean, do you know them so well that you know elements of their history, their personal history, that you had to know, but the media doesn't necessarily have to know?

09:51.163 --> 09:55.148
Ah, a very interesting question.

09:55.516 --> 09:57.659
Especially since you reformulated the book.

09:57.679 --> 09:58.400
Yes, yes.

10:00.042 --> 10:12.881
There was earlier parts in the book in which Steel Who is much more of a happy-go-lucky and a rather promiscuous young man.

10:13.742 --> 10:16.165
But that was in my mind.

10:16.185 --> 10:23.616
But I'm one of those terrible writers who cannot seem to...

10:23.815 --> 10:30.728
express the more vivid details of, shall we say, that aspect of human life.

10:30.748 --> 10:31.570
But you know it, right?

10:31.590 --> 10:32.732
I know it, I know it.

10:32.832 --> 10:36.940
And it's true for them, even though it's not necessarily... Yes.

10:37.902 --> 10:41.048
But does it help you as a writer to know these additional...

10:41.332 --> 10:42.914
Yes, of course, of course.

10:42.934 --> 10:48.862
When you have it in the back of your mind, in the foreground, it's like the background, and in the foreground you focus in.

10:49.743 --> 10:54.429
And, although I didn't deal with it, and of course, the warriors.

10:55.130 --> 11:10.090
Since I wrote his book mostly in terms of scene, because I find it easier to write, because I do not wish to state anything categorically.

11:10.610 --> 11:25.083
I like to write it from the character's point of view so that the reader is involved in the process of understanding what the author understands as the scene proceeds.

11:26.524 --> 11:33.330
I found it easier because there's so many levels of understanding of the characters of one another.

11:33.370 --> 11:39.756
Sometimes one knows something about the other that the other doesn't know about the other two.

11:40.242 --> 11:45.209
And in that way, you have attention in the scene.

11:45.469 --> 11:47.692
The reader understands.

11:48.413 --> 11:51.457
Because at one time or another, the reader knows more than the characters.

11:51.718 --> 11:57.366
You know, a word you use a couple of times earlier in the conversation is hopeful.

11:57.446 --> 11:59.989
And was this always intended to be a hopeful novel?

12:00.009 --> 12:00.650
Because it is.

12:00.830 --> 12:01.952
Yes, yes, yes.

12:02.012 --> 12:07.700
Despite the, you know, the occasion for the conclusion, nevertheless.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.063
Oh, I think I'm...

12:10.448 --> 12:12.050
I wanted it to be a helpful book.

12:12.070 --> 12:20.700
I wanted it to be that these characters really, despite all that happened to them, they do their best.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.622
They try to be human beings.

12:24.544 --> 12:36.658
They are forced to, by circumstances, or they feel that they have to, do things that are perhaps inexplicable in terms of the Western leader.

12:37.415 --> 12:53.144
but after you have lived their lives as they lived it through the book, which I hope they will, is the understanding that perhaps the reader will say, aha, had I been there, I might have done the same thing.

12:53.625 --> 12:57.452
And in many ways, I felt that way when I was in China.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.997
I looked at these characters and had I been still hope.

13:00.348 --> 13:02.690
I might have become a Catholic.

13:02.710 --> 13:05.072
And I give several wishes.

13:05.873 --> 13:17.143
I might have gotten on that stage and done things that are just so foreign on me and foreign from the reader.

13:17.163 --> 13:22.687
I think always, I've often thought, you know, why do I write about China so much?

13:22.707 --> 13:26.591
I've lived most of my life here.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.152
At the age of eight.

13:28.352 --> 13:29.173
At the age of eight.

13:29.491 --> 13:58.502
do not expect to become a writer or really be so involved in China because I think I guess the fundamentally is because I want to have others who have not had a chance to know China or the Chinese people to come to an understanding of these people that do such incredible things and even

13:58.972 --> 14:19.579
When I was in China, I found that many of the younger people who had not lived through the historical period did not know either, which surprised me, because their parents, as Summer Wishes and Mountain High, avoid talking about

14:20.437 --> 14:41.601
historical period because they know that history will be revised and reinterpreted so therefore it's best just not to talk about it but the the acts

14:42.020 --> 14:58.248
The things that happen, not the reasons or the motives, but the struggle meetings for many of the Chinese young, they have never been through one.

14:58.268 --> 15:01.513
And they've never heard what happened to their parents.

15:01.553 --> 15:05.580
And this amazed me.

15:05.965 --> 15:07.506
in the same way that Spring Union did.

15:07.647 --> 15:13.933
I didn't think I was going to have a Chinese audience when I wrote Spring Union, because I figured this is second nature in many ways.

15:15.935 --> 15:21.280
But I did, because it was published while I was there, and I had young people write to me.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.181
I didn't know this.

15:22.281 --> 15:26.965
I think this is fine for us.

15:27.165 --> 15:27.506
Thank you.

15:27.566 --> 15:34.032
Would you like some more coffee?

15:34.737 --> 15:50.113
I think one thing we haven't said and we haven't talked about background politics and things like that

15:50.262 --> 16:10.123
Yes, I wanted to tell a love story, and how hard love is.

16:11.264 --> 16:19.493
Anyway, but especially when there is also a

16:20.249 --> 16:47.134
quote-unquote, mistress, which is history, and throughout the triangle, and also how one can love differently, two different people, and feel the tugs and pulls and the conflict, the terms, when, even though you have ordered them in your heart, number one and number two,

16:47.300 --> 16:55.388
that sometimes number two love is not to be regarded as something inferior.

16:57.050 --> 17:15.889
It's something I think that happens to people everywhere, whether it's in your family, whether it's between, as Summer Wishes says, between her and her brother, that love is so special.

17:18.181 --> 17:21.507
to parse it, to weigh it, to analyze it.

17:23.009 --> 17:44.104
I think sometimes it's a mistake because I was just reading The Good Husband by Gail Godwin in which she says something about there are many kind of love, including

17:44.253 --> 17:46.495
those who are a match and those who are a mate.

17:48.037 --> 17:48.698
That's a good line, isn't it?

17:49.278 --> 17:50.119
Yes.

17:50.139 --> 18:11.982
And so, as I was reading that and hearing her talk about it on the Diane Williams show, Diane and I belong to a literary club together, and she handed the members that particular interview, and I thought, ah, my goodness, I can describe it better, the two

18:12.704 --> 18:19.094
The two kinds of love that you have, one's a match and one's a mate.

18:19.154 --> 18:37.143
Tell me, because you have written a number of journalistic pieces, and your husband is a career diplomat, and yet now you're also a fiction writer and trying to tell a story.

18:37.163 --> 18:37.243
Yes.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.461
And are you mindful of the other problems?

18:40.481 --> 18:45.375
Are you mindful of the political considerations and historical considerations?

18:45.957 --> 18:48.103
It's not a political novel, to be sure.

18:48.203 --> 18:48.263
No.

18:48.715 --> 19:05.380
I have to know the background.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.502
I have to know the history.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.306
I have to know the politics.

19:09.386 --> 19:17.558
But I write it in scenes so that the scenes are about those three people because I want

19:17.875 --> 19:35.170
the reader to be involved with the characters and what happens to them so that history is not the centerpiece.

19:35.491 --> 19:39.915
The centerpiece is always the three characters and their relationship to one another.

19:40.555 --> 19:45.840
I don't have tremendous problems myself as a writer with putting that

19:46.175 --> 19:50.886
all in the background, or in my head, or in the subtext for me, for the author.

19:51.407 --> 20:05.078
I do have problems with people who read it, and who go at the story from a historical point of view, even though you want it to be

20:05.227 --> 20:13.015
a love story, the reader brings their own wishes into the reading of a novel, especially a historical novel.

20:13.235 --> 20:16.238
And they say, well, maybe I want to know about that period of history.

20:16.779 --> 20:19.101
But only in as far as I can see.

20:19.742 --> 20:26.529
And as far as my husband is concerned, I'm very, very lucky he doesn't care what I say.

20:27.950 --> 20:32.635
In fact, all what trouble I make

20:32.733 --> 20:45.370
I have trouble, we have trouble only in that we have both been accused of putting words into other people's mouths that we are each other's puppets, but believe me, we are not.

20:45.390 --> 20:49.336
But it must have caused problems, I mean, in terms of perceptions.

20:49.356 --> 20:49.897
Oh, yes.

20:49.977 --> 20:50.798
Oh, yes.

20:50.958 --> 20:56.766
And I'm sure that when you were in Beijing, that regardless of how much you try to hear these people that do,

20:56.932 --> 20:58.735
There were no cross-influencers.

20:58.755 --> 21:00.158
They didn't believe he was welcome?

21:00.178 --> 21:01.360
No, no.

21:01.420 --> 21:07.531
They expect everything that comes out of my husband's or my mouth comes out of pillow talk.

21:07.971 --> 21:09.454
They thought you were responding for him.

21:09.494 --> 21:10.115
You never know.

21:10.456 --> 21:15.244
Well, actually, after Tiananmen, when I was...

21:15.899 --> 21:24.919
Many of them, there were secret directives saying that I was the black hand of Tenermann Square, and I thought, oh my God.

21:25.961 --> 21:35.983
Well, it wasn't even that, but how silly that somebody like me could have had anything to do with the instigation of...

21:36.402 --> 21:40.448
of a movement that happened in 289 cities or something like that.

21:41.029 --> 21:43.032
And a foreigner, no less.

21:43.092 --> 21:46.197
And a foreigner, no less.

21:47.059 --> 21:49.743
But you have to put up with it.

21:49.783 --> 21:52.427
You have to put up with it.

21:52.447 --> 21:59.738
When you went to Tufts and then to Fletcher, did you have any idea that there were these writer's genes?

21:59.758 --> 22:01.341
No.

22:01.782 --> 22:03.304
Probably not.

22:03.655 --> 22:15.719
And even when I wrote Ace Moon, which was the story of my sister coming out of China and her, the 17 years that we were separated from another, it was really not at all to write about, to write.

22:15.739 --> 22:20.749
I just couldn't find anybody else who understood Chinese who I knew that was a writer who would take on the project.

22:21.591 --> 22:25.579
And being rather young at the time, I think I was 23, 24,

22:25.728 --> 22:28.852
I wanted to hear quite stupid, you know.

22:29.012 --> 22:40.745
And so when I couldn't find anybody, I decided to do it without really understanding what it means to be a writer or what it means to get published.

22:41.566 --> 22:49.735
So... He's one who just published his first book this last year, in 1952, I guess.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.297
I appreciate what you're saying, but...

22:51.732 --> 22:53.054
Is it fiction or nonfiction?

22:53.074 --> 22:53.795
It's not fiction.

22:53.855 --> 22:56.019
We'll talk about it if you'd like.

22:56.059 --> 22:56.179
Sure.

22:56.199 --> 22:56.660
Yes.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.344
In fact, my book is listed for National Book Critics.

22:59.364 --> 23:00.405
Oh, how wonderful.

23:00.425 --> 23:02.008
Congratulations.

23:02.188 --> 23:03.370
It's about bibliomania.

23:03.851 --> 23:03.971
Ah.

23:03.991 --> 23:07.296
Which is why when I saw the book made, I said, oh.

23:07.316 --> 23:09.499
But that's for a student study partner.

23:10.541 --> 23:11.783
Anyway, absolutely.

23:12.185 --> 23:12.806
Yes.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.609
Well, no, I didn't expect it at all.

23:15.669 --> 23:19.875
When I was a test, I started out as a chemistry major, believe it or not.

23:21.016 --> 23:22.538
Let me just interrupt for a second.

23:22.558 --> 23:25.762
I did an interview with Amy Tan several months ago.

23:26.183 --> 23:28.325
Her mother really expected her to be a doctor.

23:29.307 --> 23:30.929
What is it about Chinese parents?

23:31.089 --> 23:33.973
I mean, this is the mood.

23:34.033 --> 23:41.382
Well, I think because so many of us have grown up in a situation where...

23:41.733 --> 23:48.619
Science seems to be such an exact science and that it sort of mapped out the rest of your life because you would have a job.

23:48.660 --> 23:52.183
You would be able to pursue it in a very linear way.

23:52.803 --> 23:56.367
And it's palpable, too.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.829
Yes, it's something people can understand.

23:58.849 --> 24:00.310
Wedding is so vague.

24:00.631 --> 24:06.777
It's so vague and you don't know whether you're going to make a living and you don't know who's going to read it.

24:07.397 --> 24:10.440
But I think also for parents, it's kind of hard to think that

24:10.707 --> 24:15.232
the person living with you has all that stuff inside that they want to get out.

24:15.633 --> 24:20.038
Or that the secret place is there that the parents have never visited.

24:21.159 --> 24:24.483
So you're studying science at Tufts?

24:24.503 --> 24:25.344
Yes.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.986
And then at what point did you?

24:27.466 --> 24:30.870
I got an offer from the head of the chemistry department.

24:30.890 --> 24:35.436
He said if I stayed in his department, I'd flunk out.

24:35.456 --> 24:38.779
And that was sort of a motivation to change.

24:38.860 --> 24:39.280
I agree.

24:40.323 --> 24:42.866
I started Bates as a biology of A.U.

24:42.886 --> 24:44.668
which didn't even last a half a semester.

24:44.688 --> 24:46.730
I mean, this is not for me.

24:46.750 --> 24:52.436
Well, one of the things I think that's wonderful, I feel myself a very lucky person.

24:52.497 --> 24:59.424
And it's lucky in this country that at least as far as education, you have a second, a third, fourth chance.

24:59.865 --> 25:07.253
And now that there's so much continuing education, I guess you have unlimited chances if you have the tuition.

25:07.413 --> 25:09.115
And I think it still lets one of the great...

25:09.533 --> 25:14.699
I totally agree with you.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.242
I totally agree with you.

25:17.362 --> 25:21.647
It gives you the equipment in which to pursue anything else that you want.

25:21.667 --> 25:25.071
Because at 17 or 18, what do you know about yourself?

25:25.091 --> 25:32.740
I remember when I was appointed book reviewer of the Worcester paper book in 1978.

25:33.209 --> 25:43.843
But I have to say, I shall never forget, it was very, I was in freshman English.

25:44.228 --> 26:08.734
and uh professor higgins who was my uh freshman english teacher uh gave me an a for for for a paper that i did and it was the first time that i think anyone had said to me well but then it soon passed but i think that was the first initial

26:09.237 --> 26:31.009
And somehow also we get the feeling because I was also a great reader.

26:31.411 --> 26:32.793
And it always has been.

26:32.873 --> 26:38.199
And so you feel that something as enjoyable as that you can't make a living with.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.682
I don't.

26:40.702 --> 26:45.989
I was blessed today when I had that book that I did a job for 13 years.

26:46.650 --> 26:49.133
I made absolutely huge promotions.

26:49.153 --> 26:52.277
It was a dream job.

26:52.297 --> 26:53.218
A dream job.

26:53.238 --> 26:56.101
To get every book that's published in New York.

26:56.121 --> 26:59.005
To be off his regular basis like this.

26:59.390 --> 27:04.077
In fact, when I left the newspaper five years ago, I kept this poem.

27:04.097 --> 27:04.337
Yes.

27:04.697 --> 27:06.119
You know, I'm freelancing this.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.762
I'm not employing this paper.

27:08.443 --> 27:11.487
But then it's even better because you can pick a Jew.

27:11.507 --> 27:13.149
I've always picked a Jew.

27:13.209 --> 27:17.756
I've always done absolutely the one thing I want to and what I have done.

27:17.916 --> 27:20.540
I'm not going to yell at myself when I'm transcribed.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.942
I want to have myself taught.

27:22.462 --> 27:24.986
But I don't know if I told you this, but I've syndicated the poem.

27:25.006 --> 27:25.627
Yes, I know.

27:25.647 --> 27:26.809
It's in about 25 years.

27:26.829 --> 27:27.810
That's my bliss.

27:28.432 --> 27:31.235
Largely all university towns.

27:31.255 --> 27:33.638
And, you know, where I work.

27:33.658 --> 27:34.519
Yes.

27:34.539 --> 27:35.200
And buy books.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.004
So I just got to go to Jackson, Mississippi last week.

27:39.024 --> 27:39.885
Congratulations.

27:39.905 --> 27:46.713
And I'm in Salt Lake City, and I'm in Eugene, Oregon, and Charlottesville, Virginia, and Gainesville, Florida.

27:47.294 --> 27:54.102
Well, that must be wonderful, because I know that one of the thrills of writing, I mean, it's a terrible, terrible,

27:54.858 --> 27:56.620
Or dear, for me, anyway.

27:56.641 --> 28:03.710
I envy any of these writers who could just sort of sit down and feel that, for me, it's a very, very hard, hard, hard work.

28:05.593 --> 28:16.869
The idea of having readers and then now and then coming across them and having a conversation about people that only lived in your imagination and become real to others.

28:17.250 --> 28:21.135
It really is one of the most...

28:22.330 --> 28:24.934
rewarding parts of writing.

28:24.954 --> 28:29.902
What I love about it, and believe me, is that the conversation is not the reason you do it.

28:29.922 --> 28:31.024
You love it.

28:32.045 --> 28:36.432
If I get 50 papers, it'll pay its way.

28:36.452 --> 28:41.921
But it does allow me, first of all, I retain my validity as a journalist.

28:43.183 --> 28:49.232
I'm writing every week for publication, and it goes out and it's in three or four meeting papers all over the United States.

28:49.887 --> 28:51.909
And you're here, you know, and you know if you fail.

28:52.470 --> 28:57.195
You know if you're still in the heat as the baseball guys say, you know.

28:57.335 --> 28:57.956
And it's nice.

28:57.976 --> 29:03.923
And when you're writing a book, it's, I spent eight years on mine, and you say, has anybody going to read this thing?

29:04.183 --> 29:06.266
Has it got to be any good, you know?

29:06.286 --> 29:10.050
I think those things are the occupational hazards of this.

29:11.091 --> 29:16.317
I don't know, I, every time I come out with a Berkey, you,

29:16.651 --> 29:23.889
You feel that you're going to jump off the cliff, and there's no safety net, and the anxieties, and I don't think one ever gets over it.

29:24.511 --> 29:28.400
And then you happen to have to meet a reader.

29:28.761 --> 29:33.192
I was just doing last-minute shopping for my toilet kit coming over here.

29:33.762 --> 29:40.228
And a woman came up to me and said, I just finished your book, and I just think it's wonderful.

29:40.248 --> 29:48.455
And it just, well, I don't mean to say that it's wonderful, but what surprised me was that I thought they were talking about a previous book, because they'd just gotten to the bookstore.

29:48.475 --> 29:50.236
She said, no, no, no, it's your new book.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.757
And I thought, oh.

29:51.778 --> 29:52.378
Isn't that nice?

29:52.398 --> 29:52.878
Isn't that nice?

29:52.898 --> 29:53.079
Yeah.

29:53.759 --> 29:57.743
So that meant they had to have read it within one sitting.

29:57.763 --> 30:02.807
Now, I think, Sir, because you write teens, they are very beautiful.

30:03.884 --> 30:08.650
You are a visual writer and I can't see one of the films.

30:08.670 --> 30:08.750
Yes.

30:09.030 --> 30:13.776
I certainly think it would lend itself perfectly to a film treatment.

30:13.796 --> 30:23.648
Have you had any kinds of... Well, we are now... My agent tells me there are several people looking at it, but who knows.

30:24.569 --> 30:33.199
But beyond that, what was an interesting thing that I did was I did my own recording of the Dove version, and I also...

30:33.601 --> 30:37.244
My editor and I also abridged it.

30:37.264 --> 30:49.495
And in abridging it, I discovered that it was a terribly painful process because the words that you selected and the scenes that you selected, the way you have gone through, it's just horrible.

30:49.735 --> 30:58.462
And yet at the end of it, I always feel such a pathological optimist that I think at the end of any trial, you learn something.

30:58.562 --> 31:02.646
And then what I learned was I suddenly realized that I'd written a screenplay.

31:04.246 --> 31:23.452
That I had learned through this process, that I had now, if I were asked to do a screenplay, I could, because you could not, what you could not do is extract scenes, because I think I couldn't otherwise.

31:23.512 --> 31:25.755
Well, it's a linear book.

31:25.876 --> 31:28.179
It's a linear book, and it seems to be.

31:28.459 --> 31:29.861
Well, it's chronological.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.785
It's chronological, and you follow.

31:33.018 --> 31:40.367
The things that are linking, you can't just de-link and say, well, I'll take this part out.

31:40.528 --> 31:41.369
Exactly, you can't.

31:42.070 --> 31:44.032
But what you could do is make them leaner.

31:44.613 --> 31:59.532
And what I did was that I learned that the only way you could take a 370-page book and make it into 70 pages or so is to take out characters rather than scenes.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.124
And I think you'd really focus more on the dialogue.

32:03.665 --> 32:08.451
Yes, the dialogue and... But it was interesting.

32:08.632 --> 32:16.062
And standing up for three days before a microphone, I don't wish it on anyone.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.727
I think what you have to decide is, look, the book remains the book.

32:19.748 --> 32:19.988
Yes.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.570
And this is something else entirely.

32:21.590 --> 32:23.513
Yes, yes.

32:23.733 --> 32:28.540
I think, though, that it's amazing, because when I heard...

32:28.553 --> 32:32.921
My book read for the first time, because I've never bought one of those cassettes.

32:33.422 --> 32:35.966
And this was for Legacies, the entire book of Legacies.

32:36.908 --> 32:42.137
And one day, somebody sent me the version, and I put it in.

32:42.919 --> 32:46.225
And I enjoyed it on another level that I never thought I could.

32:47.487 --> 32:50.292
The oral level, which is different from the visual.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.312
Did you agree?

32:52.512 --> 32:55.316
I did, because it was read so well.

32:56.037 --> 33:05.770
Again, of course, I'm a writer, and I hope that people buy the book and then maybe go into the oral part.

33:07.032 --> 33:19.148
But words are interesting also, because what you can absorb with your eyes is so different than what you can absorb with your ears.

33:19.752 --> 33:32.823
And again, doing the abritments, I found myself cutting partial sentences, too, that have more of an impact when you're reading it than when you're listening to it.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.550
Your first language is Chinese.

33:35.682 --> 33:45.055
My first language was Chinese, but I cannot write in Chinese because I was never educated as an adult.

33:45.435 --> 33:56.069
Yes, I speak Chinese with my parents who speak English, and when I'm with Chinese, it automatically switches.

33:56.089 --> 33:58.353
But do you start thinking in Chinese when you're born?

33:58.513 --> 33:59.674
I'm not aware of it.

34:00.015 --> 34:04.381
When I'm starting, I think of... I'm a one-language person, unfortunately.

34:04.401 --> 34:05.402
No, I think it just sort of...

34:06.243 --> 34:09.447
It comes, oddly enough, with a visual trigger.

34:10.127 --> 34:12.089
I think everything with me is sort of visual.

34:12.890 --> 34:18.717
When I see a Chinese face, whether or not they speak Chinese, I start speaking Chinese.

34:19.057 --> 34:23.122
It's very embarrassing at times.

34:23.262 --> 34:32.672
And the other way around as well is him, you know, people who look like my husband, who have excellent Chinese, not my husband doesn't have excellent Chinese,

34:32.956 --> 34:39.764
But others who speak excellent Chinese, I still speak in English because the visual figure is the face.

34:41.026 --> 34:41.987
And the writing, though.

34:42.007 --> 34:50.757
And the writing doesn't... The writing doesn't... No, the writing only comes in English because the words are... They're not translatable.

34:51.678 --> 35:01.630
In fact, the difficulty of taking a work that you've written in one language and transposing it to another, even if it's in the language that...

35:02.251 --> 35:07.837
that is the local dialect of the place that you've chosen to write about, doesn't work.

35:07.857 --> 35:09.399
It just doesn't work.

35:09.419 --> 35:13.304
Do you have a sense of who your reader is in your writing?

35:14.065 --> 35:18.450
And also, you said that you surprised the Chinese were reading there first.

35:18.470 --> 35:29.482
Yeah, only in so much as I write in English, so I assume that most of my readers will not have an intimate knowledge of the history of China.

35:29.643 --> 35:31.224
So I don't make it a mystery to them.

35:31.244 --> 35:31.785
I try to...

35:31.985 --> 35:50.549
to do it in a very, try to break up the lump of history into little crumbs and sort of scatter it throughout the book, hoping that the absorption of the historical context is again unnoticed.

35:51.230 --> 35:58.600
I don't want to put it in the foreground, I want it to be part of the makeup of the characters.

35:59.204 --> 36:04.149
The reader, do you have a sense of who the reader of your book is?

36:04.209 --> 36:04.689
No.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.091
Female, both?

36:06.111 --> 36:07.893
Oh, I hope both.

36:08.533 --> 36:13.058
I think the only person I say my reader is not is my mother.

36:16.762 --> 36:24.870
Only because my mother, in this particular book, she said, you know, I hope you're not writing about the family, and I hope you're not writing about anybody who's pockmarked.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.152
And this happened...

36:27.352 --> 36:33.091
after I had written the first part of it, in which I do have someone pockmarked.

36:33.372 --> 36:38.188
So I never give her anything to read until it's in between covers.

36:39.012 --> 36:40.194
And your sister?

36:42.116 --> 36:49.646
Yes, but I really don't allow anyone except my husband and my editor to read it as I'm going off.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.349
This is when it's in manuscript, of course.

36:51.369 --> 36:52.530
Yes, when it's manuscript.

36:53.051 --> 37:00.121
And afterwards, or even in galleys, because I also do a lot of editing between galleys and final work.

37:00.842 --> 37:08.412
So even though I may have edited 18 times, the 19th time, we're still editing.

37:08.780 --> 37:20.236
comes with a book, and I, for anybody in the family who's not involved in it, except that I'm related to them, and I'd like to have them read fine.

37:20.856 --> 37:23.800
And so, what are you planning next?

37:25.022 --> 37:25.823
A novel?

37:26.184 --> 37:36.778
Oh, I'm thinking about a children's book, only because I like to, it's a change of pace, but also

37:37.687 --> 37:48.737
There's part of me that's mischievous and a humorous part of me that I find it's easier to do with children with that voice.

37:48.837 --> 37:52.221
I love that other book.

37:52.281 --> 37:55.504
What a contrasting such images, you know.

37:56.605 --> 38:02.010
Eight-year-old Chinese girl in Brooklyn, you know, with the Dodgers and Jackie Pop.

38:02.330 --> 38:06.394
Wonderful, you know, and her being a baseball player.

38:06.931 --> 38:11.717
It allows you to sort of put this one aside and pick up something else.

38:11.797 --> 38:21.008
And I don't know what the... I have a few ideas what that might be, but again, it's sort of in the gestation period.

38:21.889 --> 38:25.373
And talk to me just a little bit about... Yes.

38:25.473 --> 38:27.495
...we haven't had a question right now.

38:27.515 --> 38:27.595
Yes.

38:27.615 --> 38:31.720
And we're going to work with the creative place organization.

38:31.740 --> 38:35.925
And, you know, apart from the book, if you could just give me a little bit about your own... Surely.

38:36.496 --> 38:44.023
your own concern and you can just take it any way you want.

38:44.964 --> 39:05.203
I think there are two things coming back to the middle part starting there that started me thinking about this book was many many years ago in the early 70s I met a man in Hong Kong who I spent some time with and

39:05.707 --> 39:13.760
I was interviewing him, and he said, there's only one thing you have to know, really, when you write about China.

39:13.780 --> 39:14.661
And I said, what's that?

39:14.681 --> 39:15.683
This is very simple.

39:15.823 --> 39:17.465
It's a word, peasant.

39:17.485 --> 39:17.926
Say again.

39:17.946 --> 39:18.287
Peasant.

39:19.529 --> 39:22.834
You cannot forget the peasant.

39:24.256 --> 39:33.250
And I think this also informs, not that they're characters in my book, but the idea that this was a peasant revolution.

39:33.854 --> 39:57.277
is something that I held in mind as I wrote this book and the frustrations of the cadre or the teacher who has to deal with leadership that is for the most part quite uneducated.

39:58.338 --> 40:03.203
And this doesn't mean that they're not heroes

40:03.487 --> 40:27.638
in the ordinary sense, but those who make a revolution seldom are able to build a society that is, I think, the best for what I think is the

40:28.867 --> 40:43.663
the civilized part of China, the civilized, the great civilization, the values that are, that have come through my genes, that have come through my family.

40:43.683 --> 40:51.972
I feel that in writing this book, I wanted very, very much to

40:53.116 --> 40:55.398
to emphasize being a little salad here.

40:56.019 --> 41:00.824
And this I saw again because of my life there.

41:00.844 --> 41:12.877
And when I came back, my work with Freedom House is based on the idea that every human being is worthy.

41:14.799 --> 41:15.280
It's worthy.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.062
Don't worry about your syntax, by the way.

41:17.162 --> 41:18.824
It's perfect.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.727
May I say, I'm listening.

41:22.007 --> 41:22.988
And that

41:24.098 --> 41:37.477
It's odd to me that in many ways, if you go back to the 19th century or 20th century, it was the Westerner who regarded the Chinese people as unworthy.

41:38.939 --> 41:47.170
And now suddenly you have the Chinese government making the Chinese people a part.

41:47.302 --> 41:54.771
Freedom Cross was started in 1941, when really you could count the democracies on your hands.

41:54.791 --> 42:01.038
And now the greater majority of the countries in the world, whatever culture, whatever geography, are democracies.

42:01.959 --> 42:03.841
Many of them fledging democracies.

42:04.201 --> 42:06.544
And failing democracies.

42:06.564 --> 42:08.967
And democracies is not easy to build.

42:09.487 --> 42:15.334
But nevertheless, the idea that the value of human beings

42:16.259 --> 42:30.515
the value that a government or a civilization should inculcate in the people is not what is happening today in China.

42:31.256 --> 42:42.568
And I felt, really, this is why I write, I think, because these people are to be valued.

42:42.588 --> 42:45.051
My characters are to be valued.

42:45.318 --> 42:48.021
They meet life as honestly as they can.

42:48.561 --> 42:51.284
They have all kinds of failures as human beings.

42:51.344 --> 42:57.150
And they're selfish at times, and they do all things that we all do.

42:58.591 --> 43:09.141
But in their own ways, they are people who need to be considered.

43:10.663 --> 43:14.987
And how terrible it must be to go through life to think

43:15.507 --> 43:17.530
that you're only important as a pawn.

43:20.053 --> 43:23.678
Everybody in the whole wide world wants to be the master of their fate.

43:24.219 --> 43:28.665
There's not anybody who says, I am born and I want to be a pawn.

43:29.426 --> 43:32.931
Everybody wants to be, I want to have control.

43:32.951 --> 43:34.133
I want to have some credit.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.474
You don't necessarily want to be a king.

43:35.575 --> 43:36.736
No, no, no, no.

43:36.796 --> 43:37.577
You don't want to be a pawn.

43:37.737 --> 43:38.799
You don't want to be a pawn.

43:39.580 --> 43:44.687
And so many people today are saying, the Chinese, oh,

43:45.123 --> 43:46.204
Let them make a living.

43:46.244 --> 43:46.945
Let them eat.

43:47.485 --> 43:48.246
That's fine enough.

43:48.326 --> 43:48.926
That's good enough.

43:49.246 --> 43:49.787
That's good enough.

43:49.867 --> 43:50.768
Why do we care?

43:50.788 --> 43:52.489
They've never had democracy before.

43:52.529 --> 43:53.390
The country is so huge.

43:53.430 --> 43:56.393
Maybe democracy can't work in a nation with a billion people.

43:56.513 --> 43:57.914
Oh, I'm going to go to India.

43:57.934 --> 43:58.474
Exactly.

43:58.554 --> 43:58.975
Exactly.

43:59.595 --> 44:06.601
And I think when you get to know characters, when you get to know the individuals, you can't say you're not worthy.

44:07.182 --> 44:07.722
You can't.

44:08.483 --> 44:09.384
Because you know them.

44:10.184 --> 44:14.488
And you understand why they have done what they've done.

44:14.508 --> 44:14.708
No.

44:14.907 --> 44:19.953
And I love my characters.

44:20.153 --> 44:26.201
I'm not sure, and they may not be good people, but I embrace them.

44:26.281 --> 44:32.448
I don't think I could live so long with them unless I cared for them.

44:32.548 --> 44:37.414
And I hope that my readers will care for them.

44:37.434 --> 44:41.139
I think that attitude is reflected so perfectly in that piece you wrote.

44:41.159 --> 44:43.902
I forget which, whether it was in our bed piece or in our newsweek piece,

44:44.607 --> 44:51.460
Your continuing concern about this young man who stepped in front of the tanks, what became of him?

44:51.480 --> 44:52.662
What became of him?

44:52.682 --> 44:53.584
We don't know.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.087
We don't know.

44:55.107 --> 44:55.808
We don't know.

44:56.209 --> 44:58.954
One wonders.

44:59.305 --> 45:00.987
They want an opinion.

45:01.007 --> 45:01.327
Exactly.

45:01.347 --> 45:02.729
But where is this important?

45:02.809 --> 45:03.850
Yes.

45:03.870 --> 45:05.312
What did they do to Hanover?

45:05.392 --> 45:08.455
I mean, when you think of history, you think of images.

45:08.476 --> 45:11.859
You think of that little baby in Shanghai by the railroad tracks.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.223
You think of Times Square after the war.

45:15.964 --> 45:16.745
There are pictures.

45:16.765 --> 45:19.488
They call it the whole period of history.

45:20.449 --> 45:25.315
And that man in front of the tank is indelible in this whole generation.

45:25.335 --> 45:27.237
You talk about profile and courage.

45:27.622 --> 45:37.583
I don't know what your schedule is, we're close to 10.

45:37.763 --> 45:38.505
Oh, I'm fine.

45:38.725 --> 45:40.609
I don't have anything until 10.

45:40.729 --> 45:42.774
Okay, so actually we're pretty close.

45:43.094 --> 45:44.277
Would you inscribe my book?

45:44.397 --> 45:44.938
Oh, yes.

45:45.458 --> 46:00.742
As I'm writing the first two or three or four drafts, always, I get back from my editor.

46:02.264 --> 46:04.147
You're being too indirect.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.529
You're being too indirect.

46:06.010 --> 46:07.312
You have to tell a little bit more.

46:07.372 --> 46:08.334
Tell a little bit more.

46:09.436 --> 46:10.077
Exposition.

46:10.137 --> 46:13.542
And my problem has always been that I want the reader

46:13.859 --> 46:16.463
to learn as they read.

46:16.864 --> 46:40.862
So I try to do everything by interaction and also to stay away from, for want of a better word or cliche, that I go way, way off on left field or right field that I have to, as I correct and re-edit, to bring it a little bit more.

46:41.028 --> 46:45.778
And one quick thing I'll ask you, because a lot of people might ask you this, and it's something you can think about.

46:45.798 --> 46:51.631
Just tell me again, I know the quote for the title, but tell me the significance of the title and how long you had this.

46:51.651 --> 46:53.094
Did you always have this title?

46:53.114 --> 46:54.818
Yes, I've always had the title.

46:55.135 --> 47:00.563
The middle heart is a separation of Chinese character for loyalty.

47:00.603 --> 47:04.990
It's written with an upper radical and a lower radical.

47:05.070 --> 47:07.854
And if you split them, it means the middle heart.

47:09.256 --> 47:10.719
This heart here?

47:10.919 --> 47:12.061
This heart, this heart.

47:12.621 --> 47:19.392
And if you were to explain it, it would probably be the core of the heart, which is loyalty.

47:20.614 --> 47:21.615
And if you...

47:21.865 --> 47:25.949
think of China in the way that the Chinese refer to China.

47:26.789 --> 47:33.655
It's always , which is said as , which means the Middle Kingdom, which was at the core of the world.

47:34.016 --> 47:36.418
The Chinese think it's at the center of the world.

47:36.818 --> 47:40.421
So the center of the heart and core of the heart is loyalty.

47:41.342 --> 47:47.688
And that, I think, actually, that may have been the impetus, because it was the title.

47:47.768 --> 47:50.370
It was the idea of

47:50.570 --> 47:57.938
the Middle Heart and how different it is in America, perhaps, than in China.

47:59.820 --> 48:06.728
Very seldom, at least during the McCarthy era, people equate patriotism with loyalty.

48:06.768 --> 48:14.637
We always think of loyalty as personal loyalty, loyalty to our values, loyalty to ourselves, loyalty to a family, but not loyalty to

48:15.157 --> 48:19.846
to the current administration.

48:21.189 --> 48:22.492
Yes, that's a good idea.

48:22.532 --> 48:23.534
That's a good idea.

48:23.754 --> 48:30.268
I think actually this is odd because you triggered the impetus that I had forgotten.

48:30.308 --> 48:33.975
And many times there was another interview

48:34.259 --> 48:35.941
but asked me why I became a writer.

48:36.242 --> 48:36.862
The same thing.

48:36.902 --> 48:42.249
I went through this whole thing about not understanding what I did because I just sort of fell into it.

48:43.971 --> 48:49.799
And then suddenly during one of these interviews, I thought, my God, I come from a family of writers.

48:51.180 --> 48:51.481
I do.

48:52.001 --> 48:53.864
My grandfather, my great-grandfather.

48:53.904 --> 48:56.607
But I never thought about that one because I didn't know them.

48:57.889 --> 48:59.651
But we've got my DNA here.

48:59.691 --> 49:02.815
Well, there's... Yes.
