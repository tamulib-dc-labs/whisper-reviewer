00:03.153 --> 00:29.498
this is side two of our librarians okay so so his idea was that um the library was specialized in information and people could you know get this other stuff other other places basically and um and then also that the library would be self-service i think the idea was that you weren't going to have much money so you had to make the library as self-service as possible so you would put all these machines in

00:29.866 --> 00:36.234
And then people would just push buttons and they'd get what they wanted without having to have a stop there to help you.

00:36.254 --> 00:38.958
So you've got an awesome system you could possibly have.

00:39.138 --> 00:40.760
Talk to Regina about this show.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.521
She loves this show.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.863
Talk about what?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.966
Technology at the New Main Library.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.387
Technology in our system.

00:47.008 --> 00:49.191
First thing she found out when she got there is this.

00:49.475 --> 00:52.639
We have no high technology.

00:52.659 --> 00:56.103
I was in her office the other day and the shades automatically dropped.

00:56.123 --> 00:59.147
And I said, this is the most high tech thing we've got in this building.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.769
And she's booted together with me.

01:00.789 --> 01:02.852
Did anybody work with the architect?

01:02.872 --> 01:12.664
I mean, the thing that struck me in visiting the place and it was even more profound looking at this tape today, I mean, I guess it's a pretty building.

01:13.252 --> 01:14.113
It depends on your taste.

01:14.153 --> 01:15.474
But it's open space.

01:15.554 --> 01:22.862
It's all this money spent for sight lines and sunlight, which is not good in life.

01:22.882 --> 01:43.123
Whenever you work with architects on a library, and I did, I worked with, not directly, but whenever you work with architects on a library project, probably on any project, you know that it's going to fail because you know that their architecture is going to

01:43.627 --> 01:53.185
The books are exposed to the sun, and the people are down below.

01:53.365 --> 02:01.721
Up here, and the reading room is down, and the books come, and they're in the sun, and they're in the sun.

02:01.821 --> 02:05.668
That's right, because now they go to the British Library, and of course,

02:06.003 --> 02:10.368
A lot of the British people think it's ugly, but actually, I've been through it.

02:10.388 --> 02:11.910
It's magnificent.

02:11.930 --> 02:12.730
It's beautiful.

02:12.790 --> 02:17.596
It's brilliant, and the books are way down below, and, you know, seven, eight levels.

02:18.156 --> 02:21.820
And the thing is really designed to be a library.

02:22.321 --> 02:24.744
The French library is a statement.

02:24.764 --> 02:26.586
I mean, it's a cultural statement.

02:26.606 --> 02:28.227
Well, that was a competition.

02:28.248 --> 02:28.828
That was a competition.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.630
And then Dominique Carroll is 36 years old.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.452
I mean, I was there.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.094
I spent three days there last month.

02:34.434 --> 02:35.976
And it's a...

02:37.677 --> 02:41.763
I'll go to the new German library next month, by the way, in Frankfurt.

02:41.983 --> 02:44.828
Frankfurt, and then they have a brand new preservation facility.

02:44.848 --> 02:49.715
Oh, my goodness, you're going to do that grand tour that Kathy and Ken did before.

02:50.456 --> 02:53.481
Anyway, Kathy Page was in charge of the project.

02:53.501 --> 02:53.901
She was.

02:54.582 --> 02:56.846
Ken Dallin was not in any way.

02:57.006 --> 02:59.410
I should really talk to her then, huh?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.131
Yes, you should.

03:00.151 --> 03:02.274
She's coming back on Monday.

03:04.097 --> 03:04.357
Really?

03:04.377 --> 03:06.300
She's going to be in David Price's office.

03:07.462 --> 03:09.105
Sorry, I'll give her a telephone call.

03:09.125 --> 03:09.225
Sure.

03:09.866 --> 03:17.117
She was responsible for developing, doing the building program, and I worked with her.

03:17.137 --> 03:17.778
I was her assistant.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.480
What was her title?

03:18.520 --> 03:19.722
She was an assistant lawyer.

03:19.742 --> 03:25.351
She was chief of facilities, for facilities development.

03:25.411 --> 03:30.679
So she had a vested interest in this thing.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.021
She knew.

03:32.181 --> 03:34.465
And she filled in for Dowland after Dowland.

03:34.951 --> 03:39.358
Yeah, but she was going to be the chief of this new library.

03:39.378 --> 03:42.343
That was going to be her role.

03:43.284 --> 03:46.510
And she, yeah, exactly.

03:46.790 --> 03:53.661
And she knew that she would have to deal with, and she knew that it was going to be a struggle with the architects all the way along.

03:54.262 --> 04:02.275
She saw her role as keeping it in check and having a reason, ending up with a reasonable product that was... Was she a book person?

04:03.098 --> 04:06.563
She's a librarian, but she's not a book person.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.768
But she came as a reference librarian.

04:09.788 --> 04:11.130
I mean, that's her history.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.371
Did Dallin bring her in?

04:12.391 --> 04:14.114
Dallin brought her in.

04:14.134 --> 04:16.758
So she was basically loyal to him.

04:16.898 --> 04:17.499
Yes, she was.

04:17.659 --> 04:19.141
Well, they all were loyal to him.

04:19.482 --> 04:21.385
It was like a corporate... No, they hated him.

04:21.445 --> 04:22.266
They all hated him.

04:23.027 --> 04:25.631
They would get together and just talk about how much they hated him.

04:26.392 --> 04:30.017
But for him to pick her... Well, she took a test.

04:30.301 --> 04:31.723
They took a test.

04:31.863 --> 04:33.966
She took a chief test.

04:34.427 --> 04:41.557
She took a test for library chief, and she scored number one on the test.

04:41.577 --> 04:42.779
No, it's a civil service test.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.103
She took a civil service test and got the test.

04:46.123 --> 04:48.006
But you have to keep interviews and stuff.

04:48.026 --> 04:48.126
Yeah.

04:48.146 --> 04:51.731
But after all is done and done, when she left, nobody was sad.

04:52.973 --> 04:53.254
Yeah.

04:53.614 --> 04:57.760
Well, when she became chief of this monstrosity that she had built,

04:58.313 --> 05:03.340
She's just a horrible person and a horrible supervisor.

05:03.400 --> 05:09.909
So she couldn't be... But she made an attempt, because you'll see some of it in some of these documents.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.612
She realized it was a big mistake.

05:12.892 --> 05:14.795
Yeah, but I mean, when did she realize it?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.216
Too late.

05:15.476 --> 05:16.537
Too late.

05:17.939 --> 05:25.249
Well, one of the really bad things that happened was... I'm not a librarian, but it seems to me if I'm building a new library, I need shelves.

05:25.381 --> 05:26.583
I need rooms.

05:26.723 --> 05:28.085
I need conservation.

05:28.626 --> 05:31.710
Well, it was designed for 20 years of growth.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.034
I'm telling you, I was there for that process.

05:34.615 --> 05:35.516
It was designed.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.598
We counted the collection.

05:37.499 --> 05:39.282
We added 50%.

05:39.762 --> 05:42.206
Well, how big was the collection when you counted it?

05:42.226 --> 05:42.887
I don't know.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.150
There's two and a half million books in this TV thing.

05:45.531 --> 05:46.472
Right.

05:46.573 --> 05:48.055
At one time, that's correct.

05:48.075 --> 05:49.357
Well, it's always very complicated.

05:49.377 --> 05:50.899
Do you have a million books in New Maine?

05:51.048 --> 05:59.662
It has to do with the government documents, the pieces of microfiche, it depends on who you're talking to, what they're really talking about.

06:00.323 --> 06:17.612
But we did the spreadsheets, we did 50% growth, and then we translated that into what the architects had given us for what spaces would be, and it looked like it would fit, and then they discovered they couldn't put in a second floor below.

06:17.980 --> 06:21.765
which was going to be an entire city block of compact stacks.

06:21.785 --> 06:26.230
But keep in mind that that would not be browsable, those would not be re-browsable books.

06:26.270 --> 06:29.394
This isn't like UC Berkeley, where it's compact stacks, it's self-service.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.036
This is totally, you have to be patient.

06:31.276 --> 06:32.197
But they could have been.

06:32.277 --> 06:38.405
I mean, if it had come to a crunch, I mean, just like Brooks Hall, the staff could, I mean, the public could have gone.

06:38.665 --> 06:43.831
But anyway, they lost an immense amount of shelving.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.755
And I said to Kathy Page when that happened,

06:47.900 --> 06:49.622
Well, what are we going to do?

06:49.642 --> 06:51.985
The thing is designed.

06:52.005 --> 06:54.348
We've got, you know, their grand design.

06:55.009 --> 06:58.133
And what are we going to do about the shelving?

06:58.473 --> 07:00.716
Well, it's a public project.

07:00.897 --> 07:08.787
And when that happens... Did they bring consultants or anything like that to say, hey, you're screwing this thing up in a very big way?

07:09.187 --> 07:14.454
No, the Department of Public Works was overseeing this project.

07:14.714 --> 07:17.738
And the library was not even the client.

07:18.646 --> 07:23.814
The library was the sort of peripheral, but they were supposed to be overseeing it for expenditure.

07:23.834 --> 07:36.454
I mean, mainly, it would be kept on the hundred million dollars, and the architects were constantly fighting that or ignoring what we were saying about what our needs were in terms of money, because they were trying to make this grand thing.

07:38.156 --> 07:39.859
We lost that space for books.

07:39.879 --> 07:41.081
I said, what are we going to do?

07:41.341 --> 07:42.704
Are we going to call the halls?

07:42.864 --> 07:44.627
I was her assistant.

07:44.647 --> 07:46.830
Ah, you were Captain Cage's assistant?

07:47.114 --> 07:51.698
I said, doesn't this mean we have to stop and redesign?

07:52.059 --> 07:53.340
And she said, oh, no, no.

07:53.860 --> 07:54.761
We'll find her.

07:54.781 --> 07:55.582
We'll find her.

07:55.602 --> 07:56.843
And that's always what she said.

07:56.883 --> 07:57.664
We'll find her.

07:57.684 --> 08:02.488
And the thing about Kathy Page is that she tends to have the sin of omission.

08:02.508 --> 08:04.410
You know, people say, who's her now?

08:06.472 --> 08:07.873
She kept everything very close.

08:08.074 --> 08:13.999
Now, is this for the one that was lost because of money or because of the underground stream?

08:14.350 --> 08:16.634
Well, the underground stream caused it to be expensive.

08:16.654 --> 08:17.275
Oh, I think.

08:17.295 --> 08:17.696
Down here?

08:17.836 --> 08:18.096
Yes.

08:18.417 --> 08:19.399
There's an underground stream?

08:19.939 --> 08:20.701
Under the library.

08:20.921 --> 08:24.086
Now, ask Gray about the underground stream.

08:24.107 --> 08:26.350
They should have known that they had a creek under there.

08:26.551 --> 08:27.713
They did know.

08:27.873 --> 08:29.456
They called it a legend.

08:29.476 --> 08:33.763
It's a public project, and a public project is not funded enough.

08:33.783 --> 08:36.207
It's never funded enough, right?

08:36.676 --> 08:37.757
They knew all these things.

08:37.778 --> 08:46.830
I mean, they put a... Dallin took $5 million out of the bond to satisfy the branch library to get Proposition A passed for the new name.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.575
He said it would be to renovate all of the branch libraries.

08:51.276 --> 08:52.017
$5 million.

08:52.037 --> 08:56.643
$5 million went to two, and that was gone.

08:57.124 --> 09:02.211
So with the public project, there's always this...

09:02.714 --> 09:03.975
Ignorant.

09:04.436 --> 09:09.240
This fellow Chafee I'm supposed to talk to, he apparently has filed a number of suits.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.581
Against the library submission.

09:10.601 --> 09:14.545
And one of them, of course, and I said, well, could you just characterize him?

09:14.565 --> 09:16.707
He's going to show me that.

09:16.807 --> 09:22.873
He said, yeah, well, one of them was there was money left and allocated to buy books.

09:23.874 --> 09:25.155
And they were taking the money.

09:25.175 --> 09:26.396
The permanent funds.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.538
And instead they were using it to buy computers.

09:28.558 --> 09:32.502
And I said, hey, you're violating the terms of this trust.

09:33.038 --> 09:38.885
And he said, so they went to court, and they have now succeeded in changing it, apparently, and now he lost.

09:39.125 --> 09:46.513
He lost the case because they said that he didn't have any standing before the court, because a citizen can't, say, complain about the process.

09:46.533 --> 09:47.254
Well, what can't you?

09:47.274 --> 09:48.556
It's a public library.

09:48.636 --> 09:51.699
As a patron, if he had a library card, it would seem to be he has standing.

09:51.739 --> 09:52.921
That would be my thing.

09:53.041 --> 09:53.381
I know.

09:53.421 --> 09:59.989
Well, the thing is, he's hardly ever been successful, because there's always a weird thing that happened, though, to it one.

10:00.009 --> 10:00.109
Yeah.

10:00.764 --> 10:07.240
Anyway, Kathy was victimized by the whole, I mean, it was set up for a failure.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.222
It was.

10:08.302 --> 10:14.858
It would have been very difficult given that Ken Dallin was your boss and that DPW was involved and that these architects.

10:15.985 --> 10:18.308
Oh, here, I can read you this book.

10:18.408 --> 10:19.409
Oh, yeah.

10:19.629 --> 10:21.191
Do you know this one, The Giant's House?

10:21.211 --> 10:21.512
No.

10:21.532 --> 10:26.117
It's written by a librarian from the Fine Arts Work Center, Robinson.

10:26.177 --> 10:31.023
Oh, yeah, The Giant's House by Elizabeth McCracken.

10:31.904 --> 10:33.426
I had my library.

10:33.446 --> 10:34.427
It's about a librarian, too.

10:34.727 --> 10:36.830
I had my library, which I loved and despised.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.853
All librarians, deep down, loathe their buildings.

10:39.873 --> 10:40.875
Something is always wrong.

10:40.895 --> 10:45.520
The counter is too high, the shelves too narrow, the delivery entrance too far from the offices,

10:45.854 --> 10:48.356
The Hallway Echoes, The Lights from Windows Bleach Books.

10:48.376 --> 10:52.100
In short, libraries are constructed by architects, not librarians.

10:52.620 --> 10:53.961
Do not trust an architect.

10:54.041 --> 10:57.344
He will always try to talk you into an atrium.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.948
Will you ask to spell her name to me?

11:00.968 --> 11:02.789
Elisabeth Macken.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.612
Nick M. C. Kraken.

11:05.672 --> 11:05.972
C-R-A-C-K-E-N.

11:06.213 --> 11:06.433
What is it?

11:06.453 --> 11:07.554
Is this the recent novel?

11:07.574 --> 11:08.174
No, it's a novel.

11:08.214 --> 11:09.155
It's a recent novel.

11:09.215 --> 11:10.496
It's from 1996.

11:10.516 --> 11:11.177
Yeah, it was published.

11:12.678 --> 11:13.279
Well, it's...

11:14.322 --> 11:15.163
Dial Press.

11:15.443 --> 11:21.629
It's about a librarian who falls in love with a giant boy on Cape Cod.

11:22.250 --> 11:22.991
Really?

11:23.011 --> 11:23.191
Yes.

11:23.231 --> 11:23.952
Wonderful.

11:23.992 --> 11:25.013
Oh, I heard about this.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.414
She lives in the North Shore.

11:26.434 --> 11:27.515
Can I just see it for a second?

11:27.535 --> 11:30.118
Yes, she was in the province and she went to the Finance Center.

11:31.159 --> 11:32.400
Oh, I heard about this.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.861
Sure, she's a librarian.

11:33.982 --> 11:34.142
Yeah.

11:34.462 --> 11:36.444
Yeah, the gold had a story on her.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.490
They will always give you an A to me.

11:42.773 --> 11:47.140
And we have another ancient article that talks about the same atrium thing.

11:47.160 --> 11:47.661
Remember?

11:47.681 --> 11:49.003
Remember that article that you wrote?

11:49.123 --> 11:49.784
Oh, yes, N.Y.

11:49.824 --> 11:50.505
Buckle.

11:50.526 --> 11:50.926
Oh, yes.

11:51.567 --> 11:51.868
What is that?

11:51.888 --> 11:52.028
N.Y.

11:52.088 --> 11:52.789
Buckle.

11:52.809 --> 11:55.614
That library from... Oh, yes.

11:55.834 --> 12:00.702
There's a very funny ancient article from the 1970s, right?

12:00.922 --> 12:01.343
Right, right.

12:01.363 --> 12:03.246
About how architect's script library did that.

12:03.563 --> 12:10.852
this new library that we've built, and it's got all of the things that are wrong with the new main library included in this vision.

12:11.193 --> 12:13.275
So what's the solution to this?

12:13.295 --> 12:14.757
You've got this $200 million.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.739
It's got to be all of that, right?

12:16.960 --> 12:20.704
No, no, it keeps getting bigger and bigger.

12:20.784 --> 12:27.913
Let me get to my... I had a point, though, that things were not going well, and it wasn't the library we had all dreamed it would be.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.837
But what really went wrong was that

12:31.087 --> 12:37.475
The Library Foundation told Kathy Page that new library is opening on April 18, 1995.

12:38.156 --> 12:40.739
Come hell or high water.

12:40.819 --> 12:42.201
Now, 96.

12:42.561 --> 12:53.575
Anyone who works on a project, a building project, knows that you add a year to the end of any closing date.

12:53.595 --> 12:57.600
Well, she accepted that date.

12:58.238 --> 13:00.921
and the place should not have been open for another year.

13:01.001 --> 13:05.145
Even DPW people said she's not even open.

13:05.165 --> 13:08.129
So because of that, books were dumped.

13:08.149 --> 13:09.350
All of a sudden, she freaked out.

13:09.430 --> 13:13.735
They were going to move the books in, and all of a sudden, oh, we have no room.

13:14.716 --> 13:26.288
By 1995, though, and I have an email message from January 96, but in 1995, right before the old library closed,

13:27.010 --> 13:30.774
Walter Biller said he remembers this.

13:30.794 --> 13:34.158
He said he could hear screams in the library.

13:34.258 --> 13:40.345
It was the day we found out that our periodical collection wouldn't fit into the new main library.

13:40.765 --> 13:45.371
He could hear screams from the library staff.

13:45.831 --> 13:53.760
And I said, oh yeah, that was the day we found out the periodical collection, 60% of the periodical collection would not fit into the new main library.

13:54.095 --> 13:57.964
and they were beside themselves.

13:57.984 --> 14:03.738
The librarians in art and music and business and science were hysterical.

14:04.118 --> 14:05.963
So what did you do, cancel subscriptions?

14:06.344 --> 14:09.471
No, they just moved.

14:10.345 --> 14:15.992
almost every bound periodical pre-1985 over to Brooks Hall.

14:16.173 --> 14:20.558
Which means it's 24 hours to get those periodicals.

14:20.578 --> 14:25.424
And of course, most people don't know that, so they come and expect you to be able to get something.

14:25.445 --> 14:27.347
Yeah, sure, I need the Olympic Monthly from 1975.

14:27.367 --> 14:27.928
Right, exactly.

14:27.948 --> 14:30.972
Well, maybe you'll get it in the newspaper and magazine center.

14:31.172 --> 14:32.033
Maybe you'll get it.

14:32.131 --> 14:34.634
But there are many other... Well, I need foreign affairs.

14:34.714 --> 14:36.557
Foreign affairs are quite possible.

14:36.617 --> 14:37.939
I thought it was everyone.

14:37.959 --> 14:40.242
No, it's almost everyone.

14:40.302 --> 14:41.704
Almost everyone.

14:41.724 --> 14:44.227
There's some selected titles that they have the full run.

14:44.327 --> 14:45.469
Yeah, accessible.

14:45.549 --> 14:47.952
But it's not accessible, isn't it?

14:48.173 --> 14:49.675
Well, no, it's not an open shelf.

14:49.975 --> 14:53.199
Well, it's even more insidious because you don't know what we're talking about.

14:53.219 --> 14:53.520
You don't know.

14:53.540 --> 14:53.700
Exactly.

14:53.798 --> 14:57.503
And probably the library doesn't know either.

14:57.543 --> 15:05.915
Well, it was even more controversial because the New Mains put all the periodicals in one place and took them from the subject department.

15:05.936 --> 15:14.748
So not only were they not going to have them in their subject department anymore, but they weren't even going to have them in the building.

15:14.768 --> 15:16.611
So that's what the streaming was about.

15:16.651 --> 15:22.219
This is part of the legacy, Kathy Page's legacy, is that she...

15:22.486 --> 15:24.529
insisted on this.

15:24.729 --> 15:33.340
This is what happened with the New Main Library being so small, and she made sure that those periodicals were put into Brooks Hall.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.563
The librarians had to do it.

15:36.424 --> 15:47.818
They had to follow her instructions, and then she also was the one who started panicking and called for the weeding of the books in Brooks Hall, which

15:48.693 --> 15:51.957
which moved to the weeding of books.

15:52.257 --> 15:53.419
So who did the weeding?

15:53.659 --> 15:56.242
I mean, were you ever called upon to do any other weeding?

15:56.282 --> 15:57.544
No, I wasn't.

15:57.704 --> 15:59.926
There are certain departments that didn't weed.

16:00.026 --> 16:00.407
That's right.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.049
They refused.

16:02.129 --> 16:06.354
So there's heroes, real heroes among the library staff.

16:07.035 --> 16:09.558
Will I be able to talk to some of these people?

16:09.578 --> 16:11.460
I hope so.

16:11.812 --> 16:14.615
Do you have a suggestion for how that will happen?

16:14.635 --> 16:16.837
Well, I have already started speaking with some of them.

16:17.037 --> 16:17.738
What's a good day?

16:17.898 --> 16:20.120
I'm going to be there Wednesday morning, you know, to be there.

16:20.140 --> 16:26.646
Yeah, well, I think you need to go walk around, and people need to see you, too.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.248
Well, I'm just saying that it's a good day.

16:28.268 --> 16:28.368
Yeah.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.451
But maybe you should talk to, like, Cher or Johanna.

16:31.471 --> 16:32.532
Cher and Johanna.

16:32.552 --> 16:34.153
I've already spoken with Johanna.

16:34.954 --> 16:36.696
Pat Hall, I don't know.

16:36.716 --> 16:38.157
What's a good day to do that?

16:38.930 --> 16:41.574
Can you get them to call him?

16:41.955 --> 16:47.685
I'd be happy just to come over.

16:47.705 --> 16:49.348
See, that's the other part, too.

16:50.490 --> 16:54.637
Everybody's so overworked, they may need to call you.

16:54.777 --> 17:04.954
So I've sort of been asking people, would you give me permission to give Nick Bassbaines your telephone number?

17:05.305 --> 17:07.190
Some of them have already started saying yes.

17:07.210 --> 17:09.757
And I told a couple of people to call you.

17:10.659 --> 17:11.782
Some guy called me.

17:11.822 --> 17:12.284
Phil Silverstein?

17:12.304 --> 17:13.447
Yeah, who is he?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.372
Oh, Phil is wonderful.

17:15.412 --> 17:16.314
He's a patron.

17:16.355 --> 17:17.798
He's a patron, yeah.

17:17.818 --> 17:18.420
I couldn't...

17:18.873 --> 17:22.216
I couldn't make out what he said.

17:22.516 --> 17:26.200
He's a very funny guy, but he came to a library commission meeting.

17:26.260 --> 17:29.863
He was somebody I worked with like 15 years ago.

17:29.903 --> 17:31.685
He was an actor, very funny.

17:31.705 --> 17:38.591
But he came to one library commission meeting, I think, maybe two, and just did a wonderful explanation of what was wrong with building.

17:38.891 --> 17:46.298
The checkout stands were on a curve like this, so if you're waiting here, you can't see.

17:46.818 --> 17:50.062
when the next person's station is open.

17:50.082 --> 18:04.521
I mean, all of these clubs, all these design clubs... But clearly the kinds of things that only a person who uses a library would be unlikely to ever be aware of.

18:04.962 --> 18:13.753
It's so sad, because when you're involved in programming and doing it, you think, we thought of everything, we have to think of everything, and it really is a tremendous version.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.659
But, unfortunately, I have no sympathy for Kathy Page, even though it was a pretty dream.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.662
But you look at the British Library, they have thought of everything.

18:19.682 --> 18:23.307
Of course, they've been building the thing for 20 years, and it's not done, and it's not done.

18:23.327 --> 18:24.728
When it's done, it's going to be done.

18:24.748 --> 18:26.851
Oh, well, that's the other thing that happened.

18:26.871 --> 18:28.053
That's what you were just saying.

18:28.073 --> 18:31.277
The commission was saying, on budget, on time, on program.

18:31.517 --> 18:32.539
See, they have a statement.

18:32.679 --> 18:41.310
I think this is about glitz and making a statement and about the private family.

18:41.662 --> 18:48.411
the public-private partnership, and how great it worked out, and everybody's included.

18:48.431 --> 18:52.556
Well, everybody wasn't included, but it really was about a statement that these people were making.

18:52.997 --> 18:57.583
And so it became a symbol of everything that was wrong.

18:58.724 --> 19:00.386
Nothing turned out right.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.990
Is there anybody happy with it?

19:03.010 --> 19:07.516
Some patrons, some of the public... Some people like the building.

19:07.536 --> 19:10.099
Some people in the public like the building.

19:10.703 --> 19:13.327
But it's noisy.

19:13.347 --> 19:13.708
It's really noisy.

19:13.768 --> 19:16.433
I went in there last year, and I went on a tour.

19:16.733 --> 19:19.718
That was a year ago.

19:19.738 --> 19:25.528
But not only that, I remember sitting and you could hear people talking way over there.

19:25.548 --> 19:26.690
The acoustics are wonderful.

19:26.950 --> 19:30.676
I mean, but it's not... It's not supposed to be.

19:30.776 --> 19:33.461
It's very noisy.

19:33.481 --> 19:37.167
I mean, in our department, there's a big barrel of killing.

19:37.433 --> 19:39.898
And it conducts noise beautifully.

19:40.139 --> 19:41.241
We saw that in libraries.

19:41.261 --> 19:45.369
We went to visit some libraries and we saw that in one library.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.296
You can hear every word that happens.

19:48.316 --> 19:51.983
I left the tape recorder one for about ten minutes just to pick up the phone.

19:52.003 --> 19:52.384
Oh, that's good.

19:52.404 --> 19:53.346
But here's the other thing.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.328
Here's the other thing.

19:54.308 --> 19:59.536
Take a look at all the terminals and all the internet, the Netscape, the PCs.

19:59.656 --> 20:04.984
They're all put out where they can make the most noise to people who are trying to read.

20:05.084 --> 20:10.272
Oh yes, and the security gate.

20:10.713 --> 20:16.722
Everything that happens in the bottom floor of the atrium goes up and is amplified.

20:16.702 --> 20:22.591
A crying child in the checkout line could just drive you wild.

20:23.293 --> 20:27.459
On the third floor, there is no glass.

20:27.479 --> 20:30.644
Third, wait, is it the third and fourth floors?

20:31.105 --> 20:36.173
On the fifth, no, on the fourth floor, it is glassed in.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.415
On the fifth floor, it's glassed in.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.858
Third floor, no glass.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.203
We said, is it possible that

20:42.453 --> 20:46.561
The architects could be made to glass in the third floor.

20:48.364 --> 20:51.070
Because it's evidently a big problem.

20:51.090 --> 21:00.808
And then we were told by one of the engineers, if they did that, then they would have to totally reconfigure the HVAC system.

21:01.369 --> 21:04.275
The direction of the air flow and all that business.

21:04.492 --> 21:06.757
But it's created massive problems.

21:06.777 --> 21:10.666
And not only that, we had a recent patron who threatened to throw himself off.

21:10.806 --> 21:11.127
No.

21:11.368 --> 21:12.129
No.

21:12.149 --> 21:12.470
Where?

21:12.991 --> 21:14.194
Well, we've been expecting that.

21:14.475 --> 21:15.156
Yes, we have.

21:15.196 --> 21:16.459
We have been waiting for that.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.695
He was on the third floor.

21:19.715 --> 21:21.177
On the third floor balcony.

21:21.217 --> 21:24.360
This wasn't because of anger at the library.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.821
No, just anger at his room.

21:25.861 --> 21:28.864
You would assume that it probably had his sad life.

21:28.884 --> 21:30.606
This was just a suicide attempt.

21:30.626 --> 21:40.915
Well, we already had a suicide attempt on behalf of a book that threw itself off one of the Atlas cases and landed next to a patron on the first war.

21:41.156 --> 21:41.596
Oh, no.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.678
It tried to kill itself.

21:43.844 --> 21:48.190
They had to move the Atlas cases away from the light well.

21:48.250 --> 21:48.690
Do it again.

21:48.730 --> 21:50.733
What happened now?

21:50.773 --> 21:54.638
What really happened was there were map, you know, Atlas cases.

21:54.658 --> 21:55.880
But you could hear big books.

21:56.160 --> 21:56.961
Big books.

21:57.041 --> 22:01.487
And the Atlases were sitting on top of the Atlas cases that were right next to the light well.

22:01.507 --> 22:02.629
Did you get killed by a book?

22:02.649 --> 22:06.674
And one of them must have been pushed by someone or something.

22:06.874 --> 22:09.818
And the book, the Atlas, big, heavy book,

22:10.085 --> 22:14.512
flipped over and down through the light well and landed on the first floor.

22:14.572 --> 22:15.493
How many floors did it fall?

22:15.693 --> 22:15.974
Three.

22:16.895 --> 22:17.797
That's a missile.

22:17.957 --> 22:18.658
That is it.

22:18.778 --> 22:20.401
It could have really hurt somebody.

22:20.681 --> 22:21.262
And so it landed?

22:21.482 --> 22:23.846
And it landed on the floor on the first floor.

22:23.866 --> 22:24.747
That's a tremendous sound.

22:25.168 --> 22:28.793
Well, the third floor, the humanity staff was very upset.

22:28.813 --> 22:31.317
So they immediately moved the atlas to it.

22:31.870 --> 22:33.675
They were there in a bad position anyway.

22:33.775 --> 22:37.125
Besides the atrium, it was badly designed everywhere.

22:37.145 --> 22:43.703
It is very much like the Rio de Janeiro in that there was a lot of theory that went into it, this occupied wall.

22:44.003 --> 23:03.514
ideas you know about that and you know from light into i do yes i do yeah and the light into dark and all this stuff so you have this sort of like the book the library as a text oh yeah and bridges into the light right and the light and the you know

23:03.494 --> 23:05.056
It used to be there.

23:05.236 --> 23:05.717
I'm sorry.

23:05.737 --> 23:06.197
Oh, really?

23:06.217 --> 23:07.158
A fellow in France.

23:08.840 --> 23:13.806
But he had this bold idea with the four books facing each other and a forest in the middle.

23:13.846 --> 23:15.788
But see, there's the grand statement, too.

23:15.808 --> 23:17.210
This is Mitterrand's grand statement.

23:17.230 --> 23:17.450
Oh, it is.

23:17.470 --> 23:17.891
And you know what?

23:17.911 --> 23:19.112
The French love it.

23:19.132 --> 23:19.733
Oh, they do?

23:19.873 --> 23:21.856
Oh, I heard the librarians are having a hell of a time.

23:21.876 --> 23:27.222
Well, I talked to the head lady, Jacqueline Sanson, who basically works for the top guy.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.685
She's not a librarian, but she is.

23:30.766 --> 23:32.488
And my wife was with me, and I went,

23:33.194 --> 23:39.023
I said, well, listen, it's a beautiful place, but what do you think about it?

23:39.043 --> 23:40.165
I mean, you're moving the books.

23:40.185 --> 23:44.391
They're taking down a wall, and the books are going over there.

23:44.651 --> 23:54.346
And she said, you know, I'm proud that my country built all this money to build a library and did this for books.

23:54.747 --> 23:55.708
And she said, and really?

23:56.009 --> 23:58.972
I can't worry about things that I can't control.

23:59.212 --> 24:01.434
I mean, I have to live with it.

24:01.454 --> 24:02.415
She said, guess what?

24:02.435 --> 24:05.338
I don't like the books up at the top.

24:05.418 --> 24:08.200
What can I do?

24:08.220 --> 24:08.941
What can I do?

24:08.961 --> 24:14.206
So I'm working within this, what they've given me, and that's it.

24:14.226 --> 24:16.528
And that pitch about it is basically what she said.

24:16.888 --> 24:21.272
So I guess the reason I mention this is... What can we do?

24:21.473 --> 24:24.075
That's why I say, look, you've got a $200 million thing over there.

24:24.275 --> 24:26.198
We're not going to tear it down.

24:26.319 --> 24:33.832
They are going to have a post-occupancy assessment, but unfortunately it's going to be done by an architect.

24:34.313 --> 24:43.069
But they are really going to look at it and see what can be done to repair the dysfunctionality.

24:43.169 --> 24:44.872
Is it a dysfunctional library?

24:45.013 --> 24:45.253
Yes.

24:45.807 --> 24:47.549
Well, for one thing, the book drops.

24:47.609 --> 24:48.871
Oh, yeah.

24:49.572 --> 24:52.596
The book, there's a... The book, it kills you.

24:52.736 --> 24:56.781
And, you know, if you read the New Yorker thing, I mean, the stuff goes down, these books go down one at a time.

24:56.801 --> 24:57.242
It rips books apart.

24:57.602 --> 25:04.932
Instead of them, it's like sending your shirts through the airport luggage handling thing without a suitcase.

25:04.992 --> 25:05.252
Right.

25:05.512 --> 25:08.176
So the books are constantly getting ruined.

25:08.216 --> 25:12.962
And Annette has a wonderful copy of Itacidus, I believe it was, that was completely ripped to shreds.

25:14.022 --> 25:22.877
But one thing that can happen is that we could get all of the book haul.

25:22.898 --> 25:28.047
It could be made really, you know, humidity and temperature.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.649
Environmentally controlled.

25:29.669 --> 25:29.930
Right.

25:30.290 --> 25:31.933
And it could be made attractive.

25:31.993 --> 25:34.237
And it could be made into browsable books.

25:34.398 --> 25:39.186
Part of the trouble is that people cannot browse, which makes the building far more labor-intensive.

25:39.537 --> 25:43.001
than it would otherwise be... So that was never intended to be browsable?

25:43.021 --> 25:43.762
No, and that was the thing.

25:43.842 --> 25:51.010
I remember asking Dalton, because they would have these public forums and staff things, and I remember asking him at one of these things, will the books be browsable?

25:51.030 --> 25:53.613
And he said, well, unless there's some reason for them not to be.

25:55.155 --> 26:04.205
So we end up with a library with huge areas of compact stores which are not intended to be and never can be browsable because they're mixed in with the office space.

26:04.225 --> 26:05.226
It's not like... That's right.

26:05.246 --> 26:06.688
It's all mixed in with office space.

26:06.708 --> 26:09.291
So huge areas, and...

26:09.625 --> 26:18.167
There's not much you can do about that, but maybe there's, I don't know, but maybe there's some way to put parts of the collection of books that could be browsed.

26:18.535 --> 26:22.099
But you need the librarians near the... You need to cover up the light walls.

26:22.119 --> 26:23.361
I mean, there are things that they can do.

26:23.441 --> 26:25.283
They can make more floor spaces.

26:25.303 --> 26:26.965
I don't know what they can do.

26:27.025 --> 26:30.849
But we also even entertained the idea of taking back the old main library.

26:31.149 --> 26:32.952
Yeah, that's what we'd really like to do.

26:33.112 --> 26:35.494
Or even looking at the federal building behind us.

26:35.534 --> 26:38.358
The federal building behind us is possibly going to be vacated.

26:38.378 --> 26:41.101
I mean, my vast... Oh, also the old mint.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.262
Too far away.

26:42.302 --> 26:42.823
Too far away.

26:43.183 --> 26:44.745
So Brooks Hall was, for me...

26:45.147 --> 26:49.392
one of the very last possibilities because it is so gruesome.

26:49.973 --> 27:04.991
Well, I'm in favor of it without knowing anything about it, and that's why it might be interesting to talk to somebody like Chuck Davis, who designed the new underground library at Berkeley, which has, you know, oodles of extra space, even though they do still have tons of stuff in storage at NLRF.

27:05.091 --> 27:10.037
But it's that, you know, I don't like being underground either, but it's right there.

27:10.057 --> 27:11.078
It's so close.

27:11.098 --> 27:12.420
And even the federal buildings,

27:12.957 --> 27:21.271
But the problem is that the people at Bill Graham Civic Center need access, need to park there.

27:21.311 --> 27:23.154
Yeah, but I mean, how much space?

27:23.335 --> 27:24.957
No, no, no, it's the exhaust.

27:25.218 --> 27:28.183
No, but I'm talking about building a building within Brooks Hall.

27:28.283 --> 27:31.829
I'm talking about really doing it completely.

27:31.849 --> 27:34.273
And I don't know, maybe it would be better to have this.

27:34.844 --> 27:39.269
For a while, the mayor was even saying that we should have the old library back.

27:39.289 --> 27:40.671
Build a tunnel.

27:40.771 --> 27:41.031
Great.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.534
For a week, we were all in some clouds.

27:43.634 --> 27:48.200
And the weird thing about it is that there was no reason that we had to give up that building in the first place.

27:48.300 --> 27:48.981
We didn't need it.

27:49.001 --> 27:49.742
We didn't sell it.

27:49.762 --> 27:51.003
We passed the bond issue by 78%.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.425
We didn't need to sell it.

27:52.445 --> 27:54.928
That building in order to remain.

27:55.128 --> 27:58.812
And since we didn't sell it, maybe we should get some other piece of property for free.

27:58.932 --> 28:00.714
And the money to fix it up.

28:00.835 --> 28:01.175
I know.

28:01.736 --> 28:02.176
I know.

28:02.296 --> 28:02.877
I know.

28:03.110 --> 28:16.243
But if people really want to let, part of the trouble is that Dowlin and Colter did nothing to pass originally, to come up with the idea of passing Prop B, which actually doubled our budget.

28:17.004 --> 28:21.449
We were going to have to run this library on half the money that we have now.

28:21.709 --> 28:29.657
And it would have meant exactly what the branch people, advocates, had been saying, which was the new main library is going to

28:29.873 --> 28:31.134
wipe out the branches.

28:31.475 --> 28:37.902
If Proposition E had not passed, we would have had to run the system on $15 million.

28:38.303 --> 28:47.133
And Dowling did not tell the public, and Coulter did not tell the public, you know, we're building this new building, but not only is there the bond, but we're going to have to have a lot more money to really make it work.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.114
That didn't happen.

28:48.134 --> 28:58.446
It took a few library activists to get this thing put on the ballot, and then they finally came around and, well, Dowling didn't, but Coulter and some of those other people came around and tried to help pass it.

28:58.831 --> 29:00.773
But in addition, that's not enough money.

29:00.793 --> 29:14.186
If you want to have a library that does the traditional functions, as well as the internet on every terminal and lots of databases and lots of confusing stuff, you're going to need more money.

29:14.206 --> 29:17.509
And the people may be willing to pay for it because it's still going to be a bargain.

29:17.529 --> 29:19.130
And you need to have staff.

29:19.150 --> 29:20.572
Are you buying any books?

29:21.012 --> 29:21.813
Not right now.

29:22.574 --> 29:23.374
We have a budget.

29:23.635 --> 29:26.037
Our budget is less than it was last year.

29:26.303 --> 29:27.885
much less than it was two years ago.

29:27.905 --> 29:35.193
And there's always been a lot of inflation of, like, you know, they would run around saying, oh, the book budget was $4.5 million, which was never true.

29:35.634 --> 29:38.497
You should really talk to Anne Routman.

29:38.557 --> 29:39.238
Oh, yeah.

29:39.358 --> 29:39.818
Anne Routman.

29:39.839 --> 29:44.384
I mean, we have librarians who say things like, Dalvin hates books, but she would never say it in public.

29:44.664 --> 29:46.806
No, she might talk to you probably.

29:47.868 --> 29:48.428
She may.

29:48.889 --> 29:49.249
She might.

29:49.650 --> 29:52.513
I think, Nick, maybe you need to see the...

29:53.084 --> 30:00.335
public spaces as well as the back-of-the-house spaces, too.

30:00.355 --> 30:14.996
The answer to that big question is we don't know what would be... We didn't set out to... I hate this when people say, when you're progressive or leftist, they say, well, what's your alternative?

30:15.156 --> 30:17.760
I don't know what the alternative is for this mess.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.302
This building is a mess.

30:19.322 --> 30:21.285
People are entertaining lots of ideas like...

30:21.468 --> 30:26.652
In fact, I even said this at a meeting one time, we should just go back to the old building.

30:26.672 --> 30:29.475
Oh, because at least it was emotional.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.377
You could put our books in it.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.139
We don't even have room for our current collection.

30:34.279 --> 30:35.040
What about growth?

30:35.320 --> 30:39.864
If we have growth now, every time we bring a book in, a book has to go out.

30:41.065 --> 30:43.167
And this is supposed to be for the 21st century?

30:43.267 --> 30:44.688
Yeah, and that's what they're saying.

30:44.708 --> 30:50.513
Now, you know, there's a really interesting article I didn't tell you about by Sheila Bowd, who was the librarian at

30:50.915 --> 30:53.479
She was like head of reference or something at UC Berkeley for many years.

30:53.499 --> 30:54.100
It was very nice.

30:54.461 --> 31:03.616
Called Alexandria Revisited, which was in a journal called something like The Bottom Line, I think, which was for library budgeting.

31:03.636 --> 31:05.079
And she lives in Berkeley.

31:05.099 --> 31:06.541
And Steve Colter has her number.

31:07.182 --> 31:08.464
So you can get her number from Steve Colter.

31:08.485 --> 31:09.987
What does she mean by Alexandria?

31:10.304 --> 31:34.692
she means that try to have really try to work towards the libraries that are more and more comprehensive and the point of the article was that academic librarians even were saying at one point that um there was just no way that libraries could sort of keep up with growth and therefore it should have to be kind of one book in one book i don't think she said that exactly but her point was knowledge grows old knowledge does not

31:35.009 --> 31:37.132
is not to plant as my new knowledge.

31:37.273 --> 31:40.538
If you're going to have a real library, it's going to have to be perpetually growing.

31:40.598 --> 31:44.684
It doesn't mean you can't weed anything, but it's going to have to keep growing, because knowledge grows.

31:44.785 --> 31:47.409
It's not like you can throw out old dutchies into your new stuff.

31:47.429 --> 31:53.679
But somebody like Colter or Dowling, you know, they're just, you know, it's got to be practical.

31:53.699 --> 31:55.562
Everything's going to be out of line.

31:55.582 --> 31:56.303
Yeah, but they're just incredible.

31:56.403 --> 31:58.326
You don't talk about knowledge anyway.

31:58.346 --> 31:59.708
It's all new and it's nice.

31:59.849 --> 32:01.591
Nobody's reading books anyway.

32:01.611 --> 32:02.653
You just watch videos.

32:02.937 --> 32:08.426
You know, Dallin thought everybody would just get stuck at the first stop, and it would be like a bookstore.

32:08.446 --> 32:11.632
You'd have multiple copies of things.

32:11.652 --> 32:13.996
But they just didn't even do it nicely.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.699
It's not even a nice bookstore.

32:15.919 --> 32:16.600
Stupid.

32:16.681 --> 32:20.026
You said there were no acquisitions?

32:20.066 --> 32:23.332
Is that an exaggeration?

32:23.853 --> 32:28.000
Well, it's because there's... We haven't purchased a book since September.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.952
Now you're talking special collections.

32:29.972 --> 32:30.773
A year of special collections.

32:30.793 --> 32:34.437
In the general, at the branches, we have not purchased a book since May.

32:34.457 --> 32:34.618
Right.

32:34.758 --> 32:35.579
Any book.

32:35.599 --> 32:36.119
Well, no.

32:36.159 --> 32:37.461
We do get McNaughton books.

32:37.481 --> 32:38.182
Do you know about those?

32:38.282 --> 32:38.903
No.

32:38.923 --> 32:39.363
Rental books.

32:39.383 --> 32:41.926
Those are rental books from the Broad Art Company.

32:42.587 --> 32:42.908
Basically.

32:42.968 --> 32:44.149
And those are the best sellers.

32:44.189 --> 32:46.332
So we do have some best sellers.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.195
Maybe these are rental books.

32:49.597 --> 33:02.420
The McNaughton Company is a company that you pay, it's a subscription, and the library pays them a certain amount, so each branch has a quota, and they can order these books, and we keep them for one or two years, and then we send them back.

33:02.861 --> 33:05.546
Now, this is something that actually makes me like my opinion.

33:05.586 --> 33:06.428
It's not a rental for the public.

33:06.448 --> 33:08.511
It is interesting in terms of last copy.

33:08.531 --> 33:12.178
Yeah, it's like video tapes from, you know,

33:12.378 --> 33:21.823
Yeah, it's kind of weird because they're kind of selected by whoever they're selected, as I know, for being high, having a lot of publicity.

33:21.923 --> 33:23.186
Where are they at at McNaughton?

33:24.289 --> 33:25.011
They're in Brodart.

33:25.031 --> 33:29.222
They're part of Brodart, and Brodart is the computer game stuff.

33:30.063 --> 33:31.706
No, that's Broderbund.

33:32.066 --> 33:33.749
Broderbund, that's in Moran.

33:33.909 --> 33:36.193
Broderbund is in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

33:36.633 --> 33:37.294
B-R-O-D?

33:37.715 --> 33:38.396
A-R-T.

33:38.637 --> 33:46.990
And I wrote a paper about McNaughton when I was in library school saying librarians shouldn't give up their, you know, ability to form their own collections.

33:47.010 --> 33:47.671
Williamsport.

33:47.691 --> 33:48.392
Williamsport.

33:49.250 --> 33:52.354
It's where, you know, home of Little League Baseball.

33:52.655 --> 33:55.719
The books actually cost just as much as it would cost to buy them.

33:55.739 --> 33:57.381
And in fact, sometimes they're talking a lot more.

33:57.461 --> 33:58.823
Yeah, but you have to keep them.

33:58.843 --> 33:59.123
That's good.

33:59.143 --> 34:01.526
For people like Dell, who doesn't want it.

34:01.566 --> 34:04.130
Right, you want 17 million copies of something.

34:04.310 --> 34:04.831
You keep it.

34:04.851 --> 34:07.414
Basically, you're keeping it for the shelf life of the book.

34:07.434 --> 34:07.594
Right.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.357
As long as it's on the bestseller list.

34:09.377 --> 34:10.158
But the librarians have it.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.219
You know, he's asking for it.

34:11.479 --> 34:12.461
It goes back to.

34:12.621 --> 34:13.302
And you know what they do?

34:13.322 --> 34:15.104
They recondition the books and sell them.

34:15.124 --> 34:15.945
They file them.

34:15.965 --> 34:16.506
You'll love it.

34:16.486 --> 34:22.935
They file down the edges of the book so they're no longer briny, and they put a new miler on them or something, I don't know, and then they sell them.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.258
I mean, they sell them to, like, bookstores or something.

34:25.278 --> 34:30.905
They're actually... They pay for the... Somebody pays for the postage.

34:30.965 --> 34:35.271
I mean, you know, some of them are actually in very good shape because they don't go out that much.

34:35.487 --> 34:39.896
But we have the choice of purchasing them for the collection.

34:39.916 --> 34:40.377
$50 each.

34:40.577 --> 34:43.222
So I do, but I... How many libraries do this, I wonder.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.505
Oh, a lot.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.030
The branch is probably more than anything else.

34:47.050 --> 34:48.954
Yes, yes, not the main anymore.

34:48.974 --> 34:49.214
Yeah.

34:49.615 --> 34:50.998
The reason that it's...

34:51.518 --> 34:52.700
desirable in some ways.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.683
They used to come with all the cards already.

34:54.723 --> 34:55.705
They come faster.

34:55.765 --> 34:57.708
How long has this been going on?

34:57.808 --> 34:58.589
Oh, years.

34:58.689 --> 34:59.270
Oh, years.

34:59.310 --> 35:00.953
They're so big deals.

35:00.973 --> 35:01.554
78 now.

35:02.575 --> 35:04.318
But anyway, those are the only books we have.

35:04.338 --> 35:06.542
Thank God we have Nick Naughton.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.725
Because otherwise we don't have anything.

35:08.745 --> 35:09.747
We have not had a book.

35:09.767 --> 35:13.132
And there is a good thing about Nick Naughton, which is that you don't have to stick with the list they send you.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.636
Often those books are really pretty bad.

35:16.122 --> 35:18.005
And, I mean, they're not really best sellers.

35:18.025 --> 35:19.026
So you can request.

35:19.046 --> 35:23.592
So you can ask for anything that's in print as long as I'm a fairly major publisher.

35:23.612 --> 35:26.656
And there's a weird thing, like if it's under $24, it counts as one book.

35:26.677 --> 35:30.322
But if it's between $24 and $29, it counts for two books.

35:30.342 --> 35:32.324
So you don't really want to waste two points.

35:32.424 --> 35:34.748
So you kind of tend to do it for the books that are under $24.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.650
But, yeah, you can call up and order anything.

35:36.670 --> 35:37.852
So that's actually great.

35:37.892 --> 35:39.013
And they'll put it in the catalog.

35:39.134 --> 35:40.155
So I can order stuff.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.362
that I couldn't ordinarily get, and it comes pretty carefully.

35:43.382 --> 35:44.483
Yeah, they do can.

35:44.523 --> 35:49.809
But the point of this is that we have no money other than ordering.

35:50.329 --> 35:57.196
Well, and the reason is because of the domestic equality and benefits ordinance passed by San Francisco.

35:57.216 --> 35:57.837
Do you know about that?

35:58.658 --> 36:02.662
It requires all vendors who deal with San Francisco.

36:02.682 --> 36:03.563
I'm taking a break.

36:03.863 --> 36:04.524
Okay.

36:04.684 --> 36:09.349
All vendors who deal with San Francisco must sign things they may comply with

36:09.937 --> 36:13.582
offering benefits to domestic partners.

36:14.003 --> 36:14.584
Well, that's right.

36:14.764 --> 36:15.725
I didn't know about that.

36:15.745 --> 36:20.091
It's like the South Africa or the ordinance or something like that.

36:20.111 --> 36:30.926
So right now we're trying to sign our major vendor, which is Baker and Taylor, but their president is a Mormon, and he's not going to sign it.

36:30.946 --> 36:34.652
So we're trying to get compliance from all these vendors.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.075
And in the meantime, we aren't buying anything.

36:39.097 --> 36:47.810
So we've fallen very much behind, even like the most, like Berkeley Public and all the local public libraries.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.232
We should quit pretty soon.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.313
I think everybody's getting tired.

36:50.333 --> 36:50.794
Yeah, we're tired.

36:51.755 --> 36:53.538
You're getting way too much.

36:53.618 --> 37:02.891
But the whole Eve of Cedar, the whole year and how that was successful was so fabulous.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.834
I have to come up with a program.

37:05.185 --> 37:29.237
August 2, 1997, in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, he said, basically the staff is okay, but, well, first of all, he said, no one will want to come here to be the city librarian because of all the labor unrest, and that basically the staff's okay except for these ten white women, these ten pot stirrers who are all white women.

37:30.298 --> 37:32.661
So he talked to... Well, why was that significant?

37:34.058 --> 37:35.580
He's trying to make it significant.

37:37.063 --> 37:40.128
Say that we're white and we don't have the right to stir any pots.

37:40.168 --> 37:42.732
We don't have the right to do anything.

37:42.812 --> 37:44.435
And what we're doing is racist.

37:44.455 --> 37:47.019
And that you don't represent any of the special interest groups.

37:47.039 --> 37:49.062
Any of these special interest groups.

37:49.303 --> 37:50.284
Who they represent.

37:50.985 --> 37:51.266
Right.

37:52.388 --> 37:55.432
They're trying to take over the... Who they claim to represent.

37:55.453 --> 37:58.457
They're the politically correct and we're just these white women.

37:58.558 --> 38:00.100
Carried to the...

38:01.885 --> 38:07.154
It's very absurd, and mainly because who works in a library?

38:07.976 --> 38:08.777
White women.

38:09.538 --> 38:10.500
I didn't hire the people.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.645
The union did not hire the people who work in the library.

38:14.246 --> 38:15.308
We are who there are.

38:15.509 --> 38:16.570
You know, that's who we are.

38:16.611 --> 38:18.854
Now, how did you become a librarian?

38:18.874 --> 38:19.696
Oh, my goodness.

38:19.736 --> 38:21.299
I've been a librarian since 1970.

38:21.459 --> 38:24.805
Are you from here?

38:25.386 --> 38:26.728
I'm from Wisconsin.

38:27.063 --> 38:28.104
Did you go to library school?

38:28.145 --> 38:29.667
Went to library school in Wisconsin.

38:29.687 --> 38:31.469
It's still a real library school.

38:31.489 --> 38:31.850
Yep.

38:31.870 --> 38:33.392
One of the last ones.

38:33.412 --> 38:41.423
And the Midwest has a, and the East, too, but the Midwest has a wonderful tradition of public libraries and supporting public libraries.

38:41.503 --> 38:43.266
They have great library schools, too.

38:43.286 --> 38:43.766
Yep.

38:43.786 --> 38:46.670
And when I came to California, I was so shocked.

38:46.690 --> 38:47.812
I worked in Boston for a while.

38:47.852 --> 38:48.833
I worked in Somerville.

38:49.294 --> 38:49.855
Did you?

38:51.076 --> 38:55.062
And the Thomas Crane Public Library in, oh, where is it?

38:55.177 --> 38:57.140
and I've forgotten the name of the place.

38:57.961 --> 38:58.682
Memphis?

38:58.702 --> 39:00.684
No, it's South.

39:00.704 --> 39:01.746
South of Boston?

39:01.766 --> 39:04.489
Yeah.

39:04.509 --> 39:04.690
Oh, darn.

39:04.710 --> 39:05.090
South of Boston.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.332
I can't even remember.

39:06.612 --> 39:06.973
Quincy.

39:06.993 --> 39:07.674
Yes, Quincy.

39:07.714 --> 39:11.078
I worked in Quincy Public.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.580
That's all that South of Boston have.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.782
Then you get to the king.

39:13.802 --> 39:14.823
Right, right.

39:15.404 --> 39:18.288
So I worked at Quincy, and so I had that experience.

39:18.308 --> 39:20.050
When I came to California, I was shocked.

39:20.230 --> 39:23.935
It's just like the education system, the libraries are not supported.

39:24.472 --> 39:32.483
San Francisco is maybe this great liberal city, but it's... I lived out here when I was in this room, back in the late 60s.

39:33.464 --> 39:39.312
You know, I mean, this is not an intellectual... Despite Stanford and UC.

39:39.653 --> 39:41.335
Oh, it's down there.

39:41.836 --> 39:42.657
That's over there.

39:42.697 --> 39:44.319
The city itself?

39:44.339 --> 39:45.040
Absolutely not.

39:45.060 --> 39:50.047
You know, a little Worcester, where I have more schools.

39:50.568 --> 39:52.871
There's a better art museum, by far.

39:53.212 --> 39:54.293
The schools here are...

39:54.560 --> 39:58.284
the third lowest in the country in support.

39:58.364 --> 39:59.045
I believe that.

39:59.065 --> 40:00.647
Hey, how about some coffee?

40:00.667 --> 40:01.088
Yeah.

40:01.108 --> 40:03.851
He says he's getting ready to do colado.

40:03.971 --> 40:06.514
I'm still on these clothes.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.516
Yeah, he's really tired.

40:08.536 --> 40:09.598
Did you do melatonin?

40:09.938 --> 40:10.459
Did I what?

40:10.499 --> 40:11.500
Did you do melatonin?

40:11.620 --> 40:13.062
I have the family.

40:13.162 --> 40:16.045
When you fly?

40:16.919 --> 40:24.228
You know, you can take, some people don't do this, of course, but you can take, you know, at 3 o'clock, there's a whole routine that was in a Jane Brody column.

40:24.248 --> 40:24.588
Really?

40:24.829 --> 40:25.329
Yeah.

40:25.349 --> 40:26.691
And apparently it works pretty well.

40:27.211 --> 40:27.992
You can do it on the way back.

40:28.012 --> 40:31.597
My problem is I wake up my... At the old time.

40:31.657 --> 40:32.317
At the old time.

40:32.338 --> 40:35.021
I was awake this morning at 5 o'clock.

40:35.221 --> 40:37.263
You know, that was that weird.

40:38.064 --> 40:39.086
Thank you for bringing this.

40:39.726 --> 40:41.749
Well, it's just, yeah, it's terrific.

40:41.789 --> 40:44.412
I'm probably even...

40:44.797 --> 40:46.519
You know, I just bought it.

40:46.579 --> 40:48.902
I just got it.

40:48.942 --> 40:49.663
At the co-op?

40:50.284 --> 40:53.468
At the Harvard book store, not the coop.

40:53.669 --> 40:55.271
Oh, the coop, sorry.

40:56.092 --> 40:59.296
That's what I think.

40:59.476 --> 41:00.458
Arthur worked at the coop.

41:00.478 --> 41:04.163
The library, you know, has this Library Express.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.547
It's pay for service.

41:08.590 --> 41:16.039
Even when we haven't bought any new books, we still have Library Express working at $60 an hour for whoever has.

41:16.479 --> 41:17.100
Two and a half people?

41:18.442 --> 41:29.194
And, you know, that's another thing we're opposed to because even though, you know, the library can't supply everything to everybody that they want, but it should focus on supplying things which we can share.

41:29.234 --> 41:30.315
That's what libraries are about.

41:30.335 --> 41:30.996
They're about sharing.

41:31.016 --> 41:35.982
And if it's something where we have to discriminate between this person who can pay and that person who can't,

41:36.299 --> 41:45.253
and we give more to those who can afford it, it really kind of destroys the quality which libraries help to create in our culture.

41:45.914 --> 41:50.041
And so that's one of the things that, another thing that we're very unhappy about.

41:51.703 --> 41:55.569
Can I ask, so do you think Tuesday is a good day to come over?

41:55.589 --> 41:56.130
Yeah.

41:56.870 --> 41:57.791
to the library.

41:57.811 --> 41:58.112
Yeah.

41:58.132 --> 41:59.734
What do you think about Brooks Hall?

41:59.754 --> 42:07.964
Is this something that... I don't know whether she... I could call her tomorrow and ask her if she, you know, when it comes, but I sent her an email.

42:08.004 --> 42:12.290
We didn't even realize what kind of medieval situation we had.

42:12.950 --> 42:19.679
I mean, we knew it was bad, but when we first met with her and realized that, oh, this is the truth... Well, she's a librarian.

42:19.899 --> 42:20.180
Yeah.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.521
She's a frontline librarian.

42:22.483 --> 42:23.304
She works the frontline.

42:23.324 --> 42:25.807
But she's very truthful, and she'll just tell it like it is.

42:25.887 --> 42:26.708
And Dallin...

42:28.038 --> 42:30.121
specialized in untruths.

42:30.642 --> 42:33.966
And he had a spinmeister who did his spin for him.

42:34.507 --> 42:42.017
And that was one of the first things he did when he came to the library was set up an office of community relations and get somebody out front.

42:42.718 --> 42:49.407
And he told Regina, his only advice to Regina was, the city charter says you can hire five special assistants.

42:49.427 --> 42:51.190
I suggest you do it.

42:51.210 --> 42:56.577
And here's this woman who just found out that the budget was $3.2 million off because

42:56.911 --> 43:05.220
he had 100 unfunded positions, and he tells her this, and she says, it became awful.

43:05.240 --> 43:14.970
It was very clear that he wants a buffer between him and the public, and he has no regard for budgets of any kind.

43:14.990 --> 43:17.713
And she knows that it's not going to work.

43:18.634 --> 43:19.695
She's a librarian.

43:19.735 --> 43:21.337
She's been a branch librarian.

43:21.397 --> 43:21.737
She is

43:22.510 --> 43:24.794
She believes in working with staff.

43:24.814 --> 43:30.263
She said at the Branch Heads meeting on Friday, library workers make libraries work.

43:32.127 --> 43:32.227
Wow.

43:32.247 --> 43:36.194
She went, wow.

43:36.454 --> 43:38.157
She said to me, she said,

43:38.525 --> 43:41.529
go take a look at my Berkeley library.

43:41.549 --> 43:43.412
It's such a nice library.

43:43.573 --> 43:45.656
She has a very special fondness with it.

43:45.916 --> 43:50.984
She said it's overflowing with books.

43:51.044 --> 43:54.589
She was saying this with a great deal of affection.

43:54.989 --> 43:58.575
She was there for 17 years.

43:58.615 --> 44:00.077
Wouldn't it be great if they could keep her?

44:00.361 --> 44:03.105
Why search the country when you get somebody of her quality?

44:03.125 --> 44:06.891
Well, that's what we said, and she said she's so well set for her retirement.

44:08.493 --> 44:11.037
Who needs to go into this whirlpool, you know?

44:11.117 --> 44:13.741
Well, I think she asked for it.

44:13.842 --> 44:15.344
But she's really calming this.

44:15.364 --> 44:23.336
And this is, we understand, this is the place where she wanted to really end her career, San Francisco.

44:23.376 --> 44:27.803
So this is good for her, and it's good for us, and it will be good for our public.

44:28.795 --> 44:30.737
We'll see what happens.

44:30.917 --> 44:31.317
Yeah.

44:31.358 --> 44:34.401
Okay, so you said something about Tuesday, or what do you want to do?

44:34.421 --> 44:35.842
Well, I'm definitely coming over Wednesday.

44:36.122 --> 44:37.744
So you want to do it Wednesday?

44:37.764 --> 44:40.466
And then you still have Thursday and Friday to take place.

44:40.767 --> 44:46.412
Because I'm hoping to see some of these other people, like Chafee and Walter.

44:46.833 --> 44:47.253
Walter.

44:47.293 --> 44:49.195
Walter wants to see me.

44:49.676 --> 44:51.197
Tilly Olsen.

44:51.617 --> 44:52.098
Definitely.

44:52.118 --> 44:53.159
I've already talked to her.

44:53.179 --> 44:54.741
She says, fine, come see me.

44:54.761 --> 44:55.762
She's great.

44:55.782 --> 44:57.283
This is fine.

44:57.415 --> 44:59.658
So, Andrew, you went from literature?

44:59.678 --> 45:01.640
Literature to humanities.

45:02.461 --> 45:11.012
And then at the end of 92, I was asked if I would like to transfer up to the Special Collections Department.

45:11.033 --> 45:12.474
Yes.

45:12.494 --> 45:14.998
And are there any things that we haven't told Nick?

45:15.018 --> 45:16.279
Oh, a lot.

45:16.299 --> 45:17.441
So do we get to see you again?

45:18.142 --> 45:18.963
I hope, yeah.

45:19.223 --> 45:19.704
I'm here.

45:19.744 --> 45:25.431
Okay, let's send him off to his hotel room so we can go get his decent sleep.

45:25.985 --> 45:31.533
What's your schedule like on... You're booked on Tuesday, Wednesday?

45:31.553 --> 45:32.394
I'm booked tomorrow.

45:32.454 --> 45:41.427
Tuesday's... I'm hoping... She brings a... You know, she's a patron.

45:42.409 --> 45:43.190
She's a writer.

45:43.350 --> 45:46.214
And she uses libraries.

45:46.314 --> 45:52.624
She doesn't have libraries to come up with books to be republished.

45:52.764 --> 45:54.947
And she didn't go to even college.

45:55.307 --> 45:55.688
Right.

45:55.752 --> 45:57.994
Really educated in the public library.

45:58.014 --> 45:59.216
Same as Eric Hoffer.

45:59.336 --> 46:02.139
Eric Hoffer educated himself here in our library.

46:02.159 --> 46:05.222
She wasn't educated in this library, but she moved here in San Francisco.

46:05.242 --> 46:06.003
Eric Hoffer did.

46:06.543 --> 46:12.309
We have big photographs of him in the old literature department.

46:12.329 --> 46:13.891
There are so many writers.

46:13.911 --> 46:16.213
There are so many writers.

46:16.794 --> 46:18.155
I just interviewed.

46:18.175 --> 46:19.937
I spent time, and I have to go back.

46:20.575 --> 46:28.150
Yeah, because Kerwin's, I mean, he's educated himself in libraries, mostly the L.A.

46:28.210 --> 46:28.812
Public Library.

46:28.832 --> 46:30.174
And he wrote books in libraries, too.

46:30.194 --> 46:30.355
Yeah.

46:30.736 --> 46:36.868
He says that in a preface to the 25th or whatever it is, edition of Florida.

46:36.948 --> 46:39.874
He mentions going over to the library.

46:39.894 --> 46:40.836
Yeah, that's a good thing.

46:40.856 --> 46:41.858
I'm glad you reminded me of that.

46:42.530 --> 46:44.633
I want to tell you something about UC Berkeley.

46:44.653 --> 46:52.444
I had a long talk with a librarian who's a friend of mine who's worked there for many years, and I finally got Susana Hinojosa's office number.

46:52.965 --> 46:53.646
Who is this?

46:53.666 --> 46:58.573
Susana Hinojosa is the union steward there, and she's worked there for 25 years or something.

46:58.593 --> 47:01.117
There's a whole bunch of really great librarians that have worked there for many years.

47:02.479 --> 47:07.166
And Susana Hinojosa is... How do you spell?

47:07.186 --> 47:07.506
S-U-S-A-N-A.

47:08.288 --> 47:08.908
I get Susana.

47:09.029 --> 47:11.112
And H-I-N-O-J-O-S-A.

47:11.793 --> 47:12.013
H-I-N.

47:12.128 --> 47:14.351
O-J-O-S-A.

47:15.993 --> 47:19.558
I know her from Vivian's site.

47:19.578 --> 47:21.821
Is that right?

47:21.841 --> 47:22.742
643-9348.

47:23.403 --> 47:26.467
And Beth was going to... It's 510, right?

47:26.487 --> 47:26.727
Yeah.

47:27.148 --> 47:34.338
So she's... I can't remember what she does exactly there now, but what Beth was saying, a book... He's writing... She's talking about you.

47:34.538 --> 47:35.679
He's writing a book.

47:35.699 --> 47:38.022
We need an article on a book.

47:38.063 --> 47:38.884
It'll take too long.

47:38.904 --> 47:41.427
She said, everything is moving so fast, and

47:41.930 --> 47:47.135
You know, so I told her you wrote articles too, so maybe you'll just do an article about UC Berkeley instead of a book.

47:47.556 --> 47:48.917
Well, what's going on too fast?

47:48.937 --> 47:53.581
Well, it's just they have this blue ribbon committee now to sort of find out what to do about the library, I guess.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.103
Well, what's wrong with the library?

47:55.123 --> 47:56.544
Oh, it's just a terrible mess.

47:56.564 --> 47:57.766
They keep retiring people.

47:57.786 --> 47:59.027
They have no money for the library.

47:59.047 --> 48:01.169
Are we talking now UC Berkeley?

48:01.189 --> 48:01.870
UC Berkeley.

48:01.930 --> 48:06.714
I thought they were not, I thought you, they stopped public access.

48:06.794 --> 48:08.396
Oh, no, no, they just got the reference desk.

48:08.957 --> 48:10.418
They took, yeah, they took out the,

48:10.600 --> 48:17.927
I don't know exactly what's happening, but they closed down the reference desk to do some renovation on it, but it's not clear that it's ever going to be opened again.

48:17.947 --> 48:22.211
I mean, this was the main reading room with a reference desk with librarians.

48:22.231 --> 48:29.518
And they used to get more periodicals than any other library in the country, I think, and now they're, like, way down.

48:29.538 --> 48:31.520
Basically... No, more than Harvard.

48:31.540 --> 48:32.281
I can't imagine it.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.122
Well, maybe they were second to Harvard.

48:34.263 --> 48:37.806
They were number one or number two, you can ask that.

48:38.883 --> 48:43.970
She says there's been a lot of articles written about some of their troubles, but there's a lot of digitization going on.

48:43.990 --> 48:51.000
There's a lot of money going towards digitization and fancy new projects, and nothing there to make sure that the books get on the shelf.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.703
They probably have the books get on the shelf.

48:52.723 --> 49:01.515
Now, they have the room for the books, but they don't have the money for the collections, and they don't have the staff to help people find stuff and teach people how to find stuff.

49:01.968 --> 49:03.931
And they don't have the staff even to shelve the book.

49:04.732 --> 49:06.575
Have they cut down any of your staff?

49:06.655 --> 49:07.936
Have you lost any staff?

49:08.077 --> 49:09.779
Oh, yeah.

49:09.799 --> 49:11.942
By attrition.

49:12.062 --> 49:23.719
Also, they made sure that any of the new librarians that they hired through the Prop E, with the Prop E money, were half-time librarians, and we begged for them to be full-time librarians.

49:24.580 --> 49:27.324
So they're gone.

49:27.424 --> 49:31.570
And because Dallin got into budget trouble,

49:31.685 --> 49:32.406
It was frozen.

49:32.486 --> 49:35.470
Our hiring was frozen and has been for a couple of years.

49:35.550 --> 49:40.496
So we were very short-stepped, hideously short-stepped to the branches.

49:40.876 --> 49:41.657
It's just awful.

49:41.837 --> 49:50.187
And with this new budget, the city's budget director evidently took a snapshot of who was in place as of May 97.

49:50.267 --> 49:51.589
It's not even true.

49:51.789 --> 49:53.992
It's not even true.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.975
There are no vacancies in the library right now.

49:57.015 --> 50:01.000
Those vacancies we thought we had that were going to be filled are not going to be filled.

50:01.790 --> 50:06.398
Regina is going to the mayor and asking for petans and pages, and that's all.

50:06.418 --> 50:08.061
Oh, that's outrageous.

50:08.081 --> 50:10.165
We have no, we aren't going to fill any position.

50:10.185 --> 50:11.989
The branches are in desperate straits.

50:12.269 --> 50:21.846
Along with Proposition E, the money, we got Proposition E, the hours, and we had to promise a certain number of open hours per week.

50:22.428 --> 50:24.912
So the Library Commission, in its wisdom,

50:26.377 --> 50:33.151
The minimum specified in Prop E was 10,048 hours a week.

50:33.171 --> 50:34.794
I mean 1,048 hours a week.

50:35.616 --> 50:44.754
And they gave the public 1,192 hours per week.

50:45.515 --> 50:46.798
And it's written in the law.

50:47.167 --> 50:50.570
Once they decided that, that's it.

50:50.650 --> 50:51.271
For five years?

50:51.712 --> 50:56.797
And we're stuck with those hours, and we don't have the staff, and there's nothing we can do about it.

50:58.819 --> 51:00.560
Let's let him go.

51:00.620 --> 51:02.122
So I can have this?

51:02.242 --> 51:03.563
Yes, you can have that.

51:03.583 --> 51:07.227
Kathy, was that John Philbrook is suing the public library?

51:08.008 --> 51:10.070
He will when he leaves his criminal case.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.212
They accused him of child molestation.

51:12.563 --> 51:41.220
that's it this is you this is not a librarian oh this is this is part of the story but but ephemeral at this i mean but peripheral peripheral thank you not ephemeral peripheral at this we don't want it to be ephemeral we don't know that well i'm a lot of he wrote and signed a petition saying the new name library was not big enough oh he did not well designed and was not safe for the staff so

51:41.200 --> 51:45.965
And he's now, he's been out of work for more than a year and a half.

51:46.685 --> 51:50.049
Charged with child molestation.

51:50.069 --> 51:52.831
Well, we don't know how the charges came about.

51:52.951 --> 51:55.274
All we know, there was no due process.

51:55.874 --> 51:58.597
Was there a criminal complaint?

51:58.737 --> 51:59.578
Yes.

51:59.738 --> 52:04.823
How could they trump that up?

52:04.903 --> 52:07.645
Well, we don't know how it happened.

52:07.665 --> 52:09.267
All we know is this one,

52:09.567 --> 52:11.889
It was an event that didn't happen in the library.

52:12.610 --> 52:13.411
It happened in jail.

52:13.431 --> 52:15.974
Yeah, but he's been—a grand jury indicted him?

52:15.994 --> 52:17.435
No, no, no.

52:17.455 --> 52:18.677
Grand jury did not indict him.

52:18.697 --> 52:18.957
How come?

52:18.977 --> 52:20.358
Was he facing criminal complaint?

52:20.378 --> 52:21.299
Facing criminal complaint.

52:21.319 --> 52:21.900
That's a felony.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.361
I mean, he didn't go to jail for that.

52:23.381 --> 52:24.002
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:24.643 --> 52:26.865
I know that he'll have coverage of a lot of crime.

52:26.885 --> 52:30.949
I mean, it's— Well, this is a wonderful case to get involved with, because we think he's gay.

52:31.009 --> 52:31.970
We think it's a witch hunt.

52:31.990 --> 52:37.296
We think that they're— Well, Colter should be— Supporting him.

52:38.069 --> 52:46.439
How do you respond?

52:48.642 --> 53:05.663
I understand that a former employee, a fellow by the name of Phil Brook, circulated a petition

53:05.643 --> 53:06.365
Back in 91.

53:06.525 --> 53:07.908
In 1991.

53:08.429 --> 53:10.574
I would love for you to see the petition.

53:10.615 --> 53:16.749
The thrust of this was that this is a dysfunctional library.

53:16.789 --> 53:17.831
And unsafe.

53:18.192 --> 53:20.698
Unsafe, not enough room for the collection.

53:21.505 --> 53:23.708
It was signed by 32 staff members.

53:23.948 --> 53:24.729
I'm very sure it noticed.

53:24.830 --> 53:27.934
It would have been a lot more if it circulated longer.

53:27.954 --> 53:30.077
This is the point at which it had been designed.

53:31.178 --> 53:42.814
Part of the trouble is that whenever you've got something that you can be of a sex crime in a criminal thing, what would happen is the library, Kathy Page conducted her own investigation.

53:42.834 --> 53:45.878
She can't investigate a criminal thing.

53:45.898 --> 53:47.180
That's what cops are for.

53:47.200 --> 53:47.781
That's right.

53:47.981 --> 53:50.044
Plus, instead of like...

53:50.260 --> 53:56.267
You know, putting him in a different unit or, you know... Giving him a desk job.

53:56.688 --> 53:57.169
Right.

53:57.749 --> 54:05.118
So they took away his income without any kind of due process, and they conducted their own investigation.

54:05.138 --> 54:05.939
Is he fighting it?

54:06.120 --> 54:06.360
Yeah.

54:06.700 --> 54:08.182
Yeah, he's probably going to sue him.

54:08.242 --> 54:12.147
But now he has to go through the case, but we think he's going to win the case.

54:12.327 --> 54:13.849
Because they don't have any evidence.

54:13.869 --> 54:14.530
Does he have a kid?

54:15.016 --> 54:15.597
They have a kid.

54:17.159 --> 54:23.208
The kid is very detailed on everything except the dates.

54:23.228 --> 54:36.248
But the other thing is the kid has brought similar charges, not criminal, but similar charges against everybody he's ever had any contact with, including his father.

54:36.835 --> 54:37.837
Of sexual?

54:38.137 --> 54:39.219
Or just complaint?

54:39.239 --> 54:39.780
Sexual?

54:40.561 --> 54:42.263
So, I mean, a good lawyer will destroy him.

54:42.344 --> 54:43.385
So this kid is a liar.

54:43.906 --> 54:44.006
Yeah.

54:44.207 --> 54:45.729
And John does.

54:45.749 --> 54:49.034
Wilbur circulated a petition saying this is a lousy library.

54:49.054 --> 54:49.375
Yes.

54:50.536 --> 54:51.278
Long before.

54:51.298 --> 54:51.959
In 91.

54:52.319 --> 54:52.940
He saw it.

54:52.980 --> 54:54.643
Yep.

54:55.144 --> 54:57.828
You talked to Sheila Goldmacher about that petition.

54:58.509 --> 54:59.871
So she was the co-author.

55:00.893 --> 55:02.235
They co-wrote the petition.

55:02.255 --> 55:03.737
He actually wrote it.

55:04.949 --> 55:06.812
Oh, yeah, check it out.

55:06.872 --> 55:07.633
What is that one?

55:07.753 --> 55:08.854
Oh, volume one, number two.

55:08.894 --> 55:12.620
This is what we call Barbie.

55:12.700 --> 55:13.601
1991.

55:18.067 --> 55:20.791
Hmm.

55:20.811 --> 55:25.337
Melissa, do you have your piece that you wrote for the Union newspaper about...

55:25.672 --> 55:28.537
Oh, yeah, I think that's the copies of that in here.

55:28.557 --> 55:29.218
Oh, I have one.

55:29.238 --> 55:31.362
There's one on the Union Bulletin Board, too.

55:31.643 --> 55:33.265
I can take down now.

55:33.326 --> 55:34.367
Oh, she's got some.

55:34.387 --> 55:34.728
That's right.

55:34.828 --> 55:36.131
I might have some.

55:38.855 --> 55:41.520
We've got like, you know, millions of people.

55:41.753 --> 55:49.366
So he actually was canned five years after the... Yes, but the thing is, it was at the time when all of these surfaced things.

55:49.386 --> 55:52.190
Yes, and he was requesting a promotion.

55:52.230 --> 55:53.412
He was applying for a promotion.

55:53.432 --> 55:53.913
That's right.

55:53.933 --> 55:55.937
He had the audacity to ask for a promotion.

55:55.957 --> 55:58.581
He was an award-winning librarian.

55:59.202 --> 56:00.985
Devoted to his work.

56:02.988 --> 56:05.753
The question is, why was he accused of this thing by this...

56:06.560 --> 56:09.644
at this particular moment.

56:10.165 --> 56:14.772
Kathy Page heard about this, heard that something was brewing.

56:14.832 --> 56:21.642
She called people into her office and solicited their, wanted them to talk about John Philbrook and anything they knew about him.

56:26.509 --> 56:29.513
Well, the inspector is unable to substantiate and corroborate them.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.742
So he hasn't been charged, then?

56:33.703 --> 56:34.023
Yes.

56:34.144 --> 56:34.804
At that point.

56:35.024 --> 56:52.362
And when they brought him to trial, there were 21 of us that came to support him on the first day of the trial, and the prosecution decided to drop the charges because they got dates off by a year, and the witnesses decided to change their story.

56:52.662 --> 56:59.449
From 1994, they changed the story to 1995, so they had to refile the story.

57:00.543 --> 57:05.468
Well, this is a really good article because it's about the Union Rock.

57:05.488 --> 57:06.949
I don't know if I need this letter.

57:08.030 --> 57:12.014
It's not terrible.

57:12.154 --> 57:13.615
It's the further reaches of this thing.

57:13.635 --> 57:16.037
I think you can keep it for later until we find out what happens.

57:16.057 --> 57:18.219
I'll take it if you want me to take it.

57:19.360 --> 57:23.164
No, like you said, it's ephemeral to the case.

57:24.425 --> 57:27.247
Ephemeral.

57:28.208 --> 57:30.010
You said ephemeral.

57:30.428 --> 57:39.359
This whole file is for you, okay, and you can just return it at your leisure.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.861
This whole package?

57:41.982 --> 57:42.063
Yes.

57:42.083 --> 57:43.044
Okay, good.

57:43.064 --> 57:43.985
It'll take a little while.

57:44.566 --> 57:45.066
It's okay.

57:46.468 --> 57:47.570
Maybe, you know, months.

57:47.590 --> 57:49.312
Oh, and we didn't talk about the catalog at all.

57:49.532 --> 57:57.342
It's a part of what led to this whole thing, too, is that the catalog was so bad, and the point about that was the brushing.

57:57.362 --> 57:57.943
The online catalog.

57:57.963 --> 57:58.343
The online catalog.

57:58.407 --> 58:03.035
is that we were not ready to discard the old card catalog.

58:03.216 --> 58:08.165
The online catalog was not up to snuff.

58:08.285 --> 58:10.028
It's incomplete.

58:10.048 --> 58:21.208
And it's not as if the card catalog is so wonderful and so complete and so accurate, but it was an adjunct to a very incomplete online catalog, which has some virtues and many glitches.

58:21.526 --> 58:26.012
So there was no reason to throw it out just because they were moving into a new building.

58:26.032 --> 58:27.413
Just because we needed wall decorations.

58:27.433 --> 58:28.294
Yeah, that's right.

58:28.475 --> 58:29.015
Exactly.

58:29.035 --> 58:30.637
Well, the decorations were already done.

58:30.858 --> 58:32.379
The decorations were from the shelf.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.943
They were not taken from the great old market.

58:35.023 --> 58:37.866
It's an emblem of what it is.

58:38.687 --> 58:39.208
It's old.

58:39.608 --> 58:41.431
Just get rid of it.

58:41.471 --> 58:43.273
We don't need it.

58:43.313 --> 58:44.935
We don't want it.

58:45.185 --> 58:53.459
And we didn't want it in the front hall where people would think it was, you know, the first thing that they saw, and they'd think it was accurate, totally accurately.

58:53.479 --> 59:03.256
We wanted it upstairs, both as an artifact and as an adjunct, and to have the sea references and other things that would help people get started on their search if they couldn't figure out how to use the catalog.

59:03.276 --> 59:03.477
I'm tired.

59:03.877 --> 59:04.438
Let's go.

59:04.458 --> 59:05.200
Let's go.

59:05.260 --> 59:05.600
Okay.

59:05.620 --> 59:06.602
Just a minute.
