WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:07.462
We're talking to Christophe.

00:07.502 --> 00:08.826
How do you pronounce your name?

00:08.866 --> 00:10.270
Christophe, I'm sure.

00:10.531 --> 00:15.525
Since I came to the States, it's sort of...

00:15.826 --> 00:22.534
It's been modified, and now most people say something like longshore or something, and I've gotten used to it.

00:22.554 --> 00:25.257
And so how long have you been in the United States?

00:25.837 --> 00:31.043
Oh, it's been since 1993, 1994, basically.

00:31.163 --> 00:34.707
And you're from Germany, I assume, is that correct?

00:34.888 --> 00:37.851
Yeah, yeah.

00:38.168 --> 00:42.133
a specialty in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

00:42.153 --> 00:42.954
Oh, I didn't.

00:42.974 --> 00:44.857
Actually, that's not what I started out doing.

00:45.618 --> 00:51.345
My expertise is actually in 19th century nature writing, really.

00:51.966 --> 00:55.030
Originally it was actually modernist poetry.

00:55.070 --> 00:58.234
I wrote a book about William Curtis Williams.

00:58.254 --> 01:00.497
He really had the power.

01:01.743 --> 01:11.821
Then my next book was about the poetics of natural history, because I like books, and that's essentially where my passion is.

01:11.841 --> 01:17.912
So how does a monograph on the modernists bring you to Longfellow, might I ask?

01:18.348 --> 01:21.332
Really, I wasn't interested in Longfellow at that point at all.

01:22.393 --> 01:26.359
And where are we in terms of time when you say that point?

01:26.599 --> 01:29.844
Late 80s, 1991.

01:30.765 --> 01:32.207
That was a while ago.

01:32.327 --> 01:33.629
Yeah, that was a while ago.

01:33.729 --> 01:43.562
I knew that Pound was distantly related to Longfellow and this famous story that Grace reports about Longfellow.

01:44.048 --> 01:48.675
pound, you know, suffering from the shame of being related to Longfellow.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.900
How arrogant can you get, really?

01:51.920 --> 01:52.180
Yeah.

01:54.063 --> 01:58.169
Well, did that kind of attract you to taking a look at Longfellow?

01:58.189 --> 01:58.389
No.

01:58.549 --> 02:11.068
No, what really happened is I was working, I spent most of the 90s really working on John James Audubon and related things, and I

02:11.369 --> 02:15.074
My book was about Bartram, Audubon, and a couple of other nature writers.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.359
And really, with the love of books, they got me to do that.

02:18.459 --> 02:23.387
And Audubon, of course, the pinnacle of, you know, fine bookmaking.

02:23.467 --> 02:28.634
And I did a lot of work in Houghton.

02:28.654 --> 02:36.786
And I knew that Longfellow was interested in Audubon.

02:37.036 --> 02:48.610
simply because, not because he thought he was a great writer, but because he needed some material for Evangeline as he was working on, you know, writing about a landscape he'd never seen.

02:48.630 --> 03:03.567
And he thought Audubon was a wretched writer, but still, if you read Evangeline very closely, you find lots of echoes of Audubon, some of them directly, the hummingbirds flitting, hummingbirds flitting and so on, the stuff that he got from...

03:04.289 --> 03:06.072
Audubon.

03:07.294 --> 03:11.682
But even at that point, I wasn't yet interested in Longfellow.

03:12.043 --> 03:15.028
There were two factors that really kind of came together.

03:15.048 --> 03:29.233
I came across just by chance a box of little drawings in Houghton Library done by, as the catalog said, Charlie Appleton Longfellow, which was not correct.

03:29.838 --> 03:41.401
They were done by Longfellow himself, and then, of course, Daniel Aaron, who was my mentor at the time, had written on Longfellow, and very compellingly so.

03:41.461 --> 03:47.593
There's a very good essay by him, which came out in a very...

03:48.080 --> 03:53.675
inaccessible location, the Portland Historical Society magazine.

03:53.795 --> 03:57.124
Is this something that I can find, by the way, the Aaron piece?

03:58.147 --> 04:00.514
Probably not.

04:00.554 --> 04:03.642
They used to have a little reprint at the...

04:03.622 --> 04:05.585
Well, you could find it at Harvard, of course.

04:05.905 --> 04:08.228
Yeah, the Athenaeum must have it, too.

04:08.309 --> 04:11.553
Yeah, it's cited in my book in the bibliography.

04:11.573 --> 04:14.517
Oh, no, I actually saw the citations.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.682
So you will be able to find it at the Athenaeum, I'm sure.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.866
If not, I actually have an extra copy of it.

04:20.886 --> 04:21.687
Well, let me see.

04:21.787 --> 04:25.433
I have about ten titles that I'm going in to get at the Athenaeum.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.657
Which is a really remarkable piece in many, many ways.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.760
And then there is a...

04:31.060 --> 04:37.892
An introduction he did to the Everyman edition of Hiawatha, as long as I would like to have it pronounced.

04:37.972 --> 04:38.713
Hiawatha.

04:38.733 --> 04:39.614
Hiawatha, yeah.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.776
Not Hiawatha.

04:40.796 --> 04:41.618
No, no.

04:42.239 --> 04:44.883
Which is always a dilemma, you know, when you talk about it publicly.

04:45.604 --> 04:47.468
You need to decide what you're going to say.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.571
If you say Hiawatha, you sound affected.

04:49.591 --> 04:53.177
Is it like Elizabethan or Elizabethan, right?

04:53.338 --> 04:54.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:54.820 --> 05:02.192
So I usually trip myself up and switch between... So what do you say, he or wasa?

05:02.292 --> 05:06.840
Well, I say both, really, and that doesn't make me look so good publicly, really.

05:07.661 --> 05:10.165
Unfortunately, but... No, I think it's great, actually.

05:10.205 --> 05:11.147
It always happens.

05:11.167 --> 05:13.530
Well, I mean, it's an authorial decision there.

05:13.551 --> 05:14.793
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:15.414 --> 05:18.258
And he did an introduction for the Everyman paperback.

05:18.278 --> 05:20.001
It's a little paperback, which...

05:20.234 --> 05:22.798
It might be out of print now, and it's a terrific introduction.

05:22.818 --> 05:34.156
It's really, really well written, and full of the Aaron-esque kind of irony, tongue-in-cheek way of writing that he has.

05:35.879 --> 05:41.328
So I saw these drawings, and they were remarkable, and I really, really liked them.

05:41.388 --> 05:44.132
I thought it was not something I associated with Longfellow.

05:44.534 --> 05:49.720
And I only knew some of the standard, you know, anthology pieces.

05:50.140 --> 05:56.888
Metzuka Minna I knew and Polarivia Thrive and maybe a couple more.

05:57.589 --> 06:01.273
The Cross of Snell, you know, the pieces you usually find.

06:02.134 --> 06:07.420
And the drawings were just so delightful and so wonderful.

06:07.973 --> 06:10.698
so lightly done that I wanted to know more.

06:10.778 --> 06:15.026
And I talked to Aaron, and Aaron said, you know, there's really something that you should take a look at.

06:15.867 --> 06:19.774
Now, what exactly was he suggesting that you look at his writing?

06:19.974 --> 06:23.080
He was suggesting, well, he was

06:24.038 --> 06:29.671
He wasn't really, I mean, the remarkable thing about having him as a mentor is that Aaron never suggests what he should do.

06:30.212 --> 06:35.564
He just, you know, plants a little mug in your ear and says, look a little more.

06:35.584 --> 06:39.653
He's wonderful, which is why I really wanted to write about him in one of his looks.

06:39.673 --> 06:40.174
Yeah, yeah.

06:40.829 --> 06:46.297
Yeah, which I haven't wanted to do for about 20 years, by the way, and I said, if I don't do it, I'll never do it.

06:46.437 --> 06:52.066
The best piece of advice anyone has ever given me actually came from him, and it was way post-dissertation.

06:52.086 --> 06:54.870
It was that, you know, I would have needed it much earlier.

06:55.491 --> 07:07.208
I was working on this natural history book, and I gave him a chapter that I wasn't really sure about to read, and I said, you know, I would really like to hear what you think about it, and he said,

07:07.829 --> 07:08.693
Do you like it?

07:09.817 --> 07:11.404
And I said, not really.

07:11.444 --> 07:12.910
Then I don't want to read it yet.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.240
Isn't that wonderful?

07:16.317 --> 07:20.081
You have no idea how such... Of course you do.

07:20.121 --> 07:23.525
That's the best advice he could possibly give you.

07:23.626 --> 07:27.951
If it's going to bore you, don't you think it's going to bore me, basically?

07:27.971 --> 07:29.412
But he would never say it like that.

07:29.452 --> 07:31.194
But he did, in a way.

07:31.355 --> 07:34.238
You know what impresses me?

07:34.899 --> 07:41.166
Were you bringing a European sensibility to the writings of the work of Longfellow?

07:41.266 --> 07:41.987
Yeah.

07:42.693 --> 07:44.997
That's, I think, what happened in mind.

07:45.178 --> 07:47.842
It's kind of refreshing, isn't it, in a way?

07:48.023 --> 07:48.965
Yeah.

07:49.045 --> 08:00.185
Because here's this American who went to Europe and studied all of these languages and traditions and used them to inform this body of work, which we're still trying to figure out what it is or was.

08:01.087 --> 08:03.351
And then you come with this European...

08:03.837 --> 08:06.180
perspective.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.483
Am I following this correctly?

08:09.503 --> 08:10.284
Do I think?

08:10.304 --> 08:11.085
Definitely.

08:11.465 --> 08:21.196
And, of course, passages like the one that, you know, kind of ignited my interest and my passion for him.

08:21.216 --> 08:25.902
I think I cite this in my book, though I don't remember now.

08:26.482 --> 08:31.768
There's a letter in which he writes to Sumner, and he talks about having...

08:32.457 --> 08:45.975
attempted to persuade members of the Harvard faculty to sign a petition for a reduction of overseas postage.

08:47.097 --> 08:51.583
And no one cared about it.

08:51.603 --> 08:53.706
And President Walker even said,

08:54.310 --> 09:00.058
he'd only received, I think, one letter from Europe ever, and he was not hoping to ever get another one.

09:00.539 --> 09:01.681
It also was appalled.

09:02.442 --> 09:22.731
And, you know, for me, of course, this is a resonant passage, and connected also with my sense that, you know, here we are, and this is, of course, my identity as a college professor, too, and we teach Whitman, Emerson, and so on, and we heard the same orthodoxies about, you know, how

09:23.318 --> 09:32.553
the birth of the American identity and so on, you know, basically sort of the ethnomahism idea that this is the Renaissance.

09:32.573 --> 09:49.782
And there are all these people who are also in Cambridge at the same time who are far more informed about global matters, about literature in different languages, than some of the...

09:50.437 --> 09:53.283
you know, canonical figures today are.

09:53.323 --> 10:04.045
And it suddenly occurred to me that, you know, what was kind of iconoclastic in the 1850s, Melville, Whitman, and so on, is basically orthodoxy today.

10:04.265 --> 10:07.011
And it seemed kind of interesting to go back to...

10:07.514 --> 10:09.699
the now marginalized people like Longfellow.

10:10.361 --> 10:13.509
Well, that's a very interesting point.

10:13.569 --> 10:19.945
I don't mean to interrupt, but you say the now marginalized people such as Longfellow.

10:20.326 --> 10:23.093
Because this does kind of, I think...

10:23.697 --> 10:32.869
allow us to enter, you know, what is my concern for this particular piece for Smithsonian is that we approach his bicentennial year.

10:32.909 --> 10:46.988
And my take on it, obviously, as articulated by you in your book, and certainly suggested by your title, although you have a disclaimer there that you are not...

10:46.968 --> 10:52.422
You are not calling for a total re-evaluation of Longfellow.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.547
But it is Longfellow Redux.

10:54.908 --> 11:00.302
And this apparently was our first great, meaning American,

11:00.738 --> 11:07.887
Our first great literary or cultural pop star, hero.

11:08.088 --> 11:21.846
And now I'm 63 years old, and I can tell you that when I went to elementary school and junior high school, I easily was required to memorize no fewer than six Longfellow poems.

11:22.226 --> 11:22.847
Yeah, yeah.

11:22.827 --> 11:29.479
But today, I have two daughters, both in their 20s, and they don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

11:30.100 --> 11:39.077
Well, they might know a list of my children, and usually they were the Midnight Rider Paul Revere, but on the shores of Kitschikumi or something like that.

11:39.097 --> 11:42.944
But this was so extraordinarily pervasive and powerful.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.447
And what happened?

11:44.427 --> 11:45.671
What happened?

11:45.691 --> 11:53.053
So I guess I'm looking at celebrity and how ephemeral the nature of fame and celebrity are.

11:53.405 --> 12:03.194
But it is, I think, just let me finish this, in addition to being a literary phenomenon, it was a cultural phenomenon, I guess.

12:03.594 --> 12:05.956
And so now you can take it from there, I guess.

12:05.976 --> 12:12.482
But that's kind of what I'm trying to... I just wanted to reaffirm what you said.

12:12.802 --> 12:21.370
I just finished about two weeks ago teaching an NEH seminar for high school teachers on Longfellow and Hawthorne.

12:21.907 --> 12:33.233
co-teaching it with somebody at Bowdoin College, and most of the teachers had signed up for our seminar because they wanted to do more Hawthorne, and the Scarlet Letter is one of the most

12:33.820 --> 13:01.498
widely thought text and also Longfellow was unknown to them and several of them actually Longfellow and after the seminar several of them went back and they created an email list and so on so the discussions are in fact ongoing and every day I see a new installment in the debate and

13:01.765 --> 13:09.052
And several of them went back and started talking to their colleagues about Longfellow and how excited they were about some of the things that they discovered.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.856
And some of their colleagues didn't even know who he was.

13:13.977 --> 13:28.110
There was one teacher who sent an email to the list saying that one of her fellow teachers who were a graduate of Morehouse College had never even heard of Longfellow, and he had a master's degree in English.

13:28.698 --> 13:31.460
I've never heard of Longfellow.

13:31.540 --> 13:44.231
That's like being allowed to get a degree in English without having been required to read Shakespeare, it seems to me.

13:44.251 --> 13:58.283
But I also, not to insert another sort of angle into the discussion, but the reason I included that disclaimer in my book is that I also see a chance

13:58.600 --> 14:08.012
you know, in Longfellow to get it away from the discussions of what is a major and what is a minor poet.

14:08.032 --> 14:11.157
I have it right here, right on my list of things to ask you.

14:11.637 --> 14:11.838
Right.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.221
First one, major poet, minor poet.

14:14.241 --> 14:14.421
Yes.

14:14.821 --> 14:27.358
Which is, you know, Newton Arvin gets all tangled up in his book, trying to avoid, on the one hand, to repeat what others had done to Longfellow.

14:27.845 --> 14:37.201
trying to recover what... Now, when you say dentu, could you use the verb inflicted upon him?

14:37.382 --> 14:46.898
Well, people, you know, mathism in the 50s, he said we need to, I think, smash the plaster bus of his long-dead reputation.

14:46.919 --> 14:47.780
Who said this?

14:48.020 --> 14:48.201
F.O.

14:48.241 --> 14:48.962
Mathism.

14:49.142 --> 14:49.543
Really?

14:49.683 --> 14:51.186
Introduction to the...

14:51.588 --> 14:54.351
The second edition of the Oxford Book of American Poetry.

14:54.572 --> 14:55.172
You're kidding.

14:55.473 --> 14:55.793
Yeah.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.117
And, of course, the third edition is just out now.

14:59.377 --> 14:59.918
That's right.

14:59.978 --> 15:04.123
Leland puts six poems in there.

15:04.223 --> 15:05.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:05.765 --> 15:06.846
But is that what he says?

15:07.267 --> 15:08.748
Yeah.

15:08.849 --> 15:09.029
Uh-huh.

15:09.049 --> 15:09.890
I'll have to get that then.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.390
It should be.

15:10.410 --> 15:16.638
Yeah, and then the Lewiston quote about the wretched schoolchildren and who got wretched schoolchildren?

15:16.698 --> 15:18.540
Read Longfellow today.

15:18.520 --> 15:30.493
And Arvin wants to sort of be more sophisticated about it, but because he's all tangled up in this minor and major kind of categorization, he doesn't get anywhere, really.

15:30.733 --> 15:37.800
I mean, he stops himself halfway and then says, but for all that, it really isn't a major poem.

15:38.741 --> 15:43.026
And interesting enough...

15:43.377 --> 15:55.494
Even the so-called cultural studies people today who write about Longfield, Eric Harrelson, and a couple of other names come to mind, they cannot move away from that.

15:55.995 --> 16:05.669
Even though they see themselves as in the vanguard of new methodologies and so on, they always have to at some point acknowledge that he's not a great writer.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.014
Let me just interject.

16:09.054 --> 16:10.316
Do you agree with that?

16:11.517 --> 16:13.300
Or do you dispute that?

16:14.444 --> 16:25.960
I think it's a category that, for me, has lost its relevance, really, which is one of the results of working on Longfield.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.323
Several of the poems mean personally a lot to me.

16:29.104 --> 16:33.009
Some of the poems I find very beautiful, others I have to force myself to read.

16:34.391 --> 16:37.716
My standards have never been one of my favorites.

16:38.176 --> 16:42.983
But I've become more...

16:43.418 --> 16:56.695
respectful, I guess, of the work he's been trying to do, breaking down the barriers between taste and appetite, so to speak.

16:56.996 --> 16:57.496
Taste?

16:57.737 --> 17:08.110
Taste and appetite, by which I mean taste is something for refined people, refined readers, cultured people who have the equipment to understand.

17:08.377 --> 17:13.024
And that's a long fellow that we're talking about there, do you think?

17:13.244 --> 17:14.606
Yeah.

17:16.328 --> 17:29.747
But also, I mean, even in his less ambitious work, in his more popular work, you do, there's some, you never forget that he's a learned poet.

17:30.308 --> 17:34.654
And there's always something that you find yourself wondering about, that you find yourself

17:35.258 --> 17:46.150
Having to look up, a simple example is the children's hour where the Bishop of Bingen appears, which had no meaning for most of Longfellow's readers.

17:47.251 --> 18:02.228
It was something that he'd picked up on one of his travels that he knew about because he'd been to Europe, because he was familiar with those stories, because he'd read Robert Sotheby, because he knew more than most people at his time did.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.356
So he never lets you forget.

18:05.037 --> 18:10.145
So is he writing for himself and his circle there, or for the wider readership, do you think?

18:10.946 --> 18:19.879
Well, I think the challenge is that he was combining those things and was indicating that there is something more than consumption.

18:20.781 --> 18:24.486
There is stuff that you need to think about.

18:25.040 --> 18:30.017
inform yourselves about, if not in this poem, maybe next time you pay attention to it.

18:30.037 --> 18:33.287
There's a sort of a little bit of strangeness that he puts into a poem.

18:33.608 --> 18:36.197
You know, that takes you, I'm not saying that

18:36.650 --> 18:39.613
All readers had to go and look up who the Bishop of Bingham was.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.316
But just the fact that this is there in the poem.

18:42.336 --> 18:43.757
And they didn't have Google either.

18:43.977 --> 18:44.398
That's right.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.421
I mean, I could do this right now as we're talking if I choose to.

18:47.661 --> 18:47.941
Yeah.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.224
To find out who the Bishop of Bingham is.

18:50.644 --> 18:56.410
But the point is that this is right there in the poem, and it takes you out of the American context.

18:56.430 --> 19:02.556
And I suggest something to you that is other than the world that you know.

19:03.008 --> 19:09.315
as the poet says in Tales of the Wayside Inn, which is one of my favorite Longfellow works.

19:09.556 --> 19:12.459
And I live, by the way, about 10 miles from the Wayside Inn.

19:12.679 --> 19:13.120
You do?

19:13.140 --> 19:16.924
We actually, my wife and I, got married at the Wayside Inn.

19:16.944 --> 19:17.305
Oh, really?

19:17.385 --> 19:20.629
We were going to marry our daughter there last month.

19:20.769 --> 19:21.670
No, we did.

19:22.391 --> 19:25.434
And this was before my interest in Longfellow.

19:25.474 --> 19:32.222
The reason being, my wife is a violinist who did a lot of, we lived in Boston for a long time, and she

19:32.658 --> 19:41.449
in Cambridge and Somerville, and she did a lot of gigging, and The Way Set In was one of the least expensive sites.

19:41.809 --> 19:43.812
It was a very lovely venue.

19:43.912 --> 19:44.733
It worked out great.

19:45.174 --> 19:50.580
But the poet says in The Taste of the Way Set In, don't think for the literary sunsets in your backyard only.

19:52.222 --> 19:54.705
So, not in your backyard only.

19:54.826 --> 19:58.570
It's something that happens that's the global phenomenon.

19:59.271 --> 20:00.032
And...

20:00.248 --> 20:11.768
And I see the same impulse driving his work as a translator, an attempt to remind readers that this is a translation from a work that's not written in English.

20:11.788 --> 20:14.813
So you put an Italian word right into your translation.

20:15.394 --> 20:20.683
You do make the syntax so that it doesn't sound English, which a lot of people make fun of.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.847
Even today when Matthew Pearl...

20:23.047 --> 20:25.670
edition of the Inferno was reissued.

20:25.710 --> 20:31.557
I think Christopher Benfey, in a review, foreslaved that, you know, what are we supposed to do with those lines?

20:32.198 --> 20:33.419
They don't sound good.

20:33.539 --> 20:35.001
They don't sound English.

20:35.121 --> 20:35.401
Exactly.

20:35.421 --> 20:39.386
Well, did he even try the... Didn't he try the Tessarima rhyme?

20:39.586 --> 20:41.929
I don't think he did, but... No, no, he did not.

20:42.149 --> 20:42.670
He did not.

20:42.710 --> 20:50.539
But he did rhyme the... Yes, he... It was an attempt to use

20:51.194 --> 20:53.316
English verse, that's for sure.

20:53.997 --> 21:06.531
But it was not an exact attempt to replicate Dante because the chapter reminds me that they're like, he has close numbers, like the blossoms on a hawthorn bush.

21:06.952 --> 21:09.655
Something has to be sacrificed in that translation.

21:09.675 --> 21:19.986
But I can still remind my readers that this is not an English text because that's important to me, that you look beyond who you are and what you know.

21:20.759 --> 21:27.148
And when I say breaking down the distinction between taste and appetite, these are poems that are meant to be enjoyed.

21:27.229 --> 21:31.895
They're poems that are meant to be consumed and reproduced, recreated.

21:32.937 --> 21:41.049
At the same time, they also appeal to sort of a higher sense of what culture is supposed to be.

21:41.069 --> 21:42.771
Now, on Longfellow's part?

21:42.791 --> 21:44.013
On Longfellow's part, yes.

21:44.534 --> 21:49.281
And that is a project that I find compelling.

21:49.733 --> 22:00.691
And very, very challenging because it also challenges our own orthodoxies, critical orthodoxies of what literature and the teaching of literature is all about.

22:01.332 --> 22:09.987
English departments have instilled in us in a sense that a poem is good if it's difficult and if you spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly it is.

22:10.253 --> 22:24.339
Longfellow is the victim of that kind of... Well, it made him exceedingly popular on the one hand, but demeaned on the other by certainly the modernists in the 20th century.

22:25.280 --> 22:31.772
So coming back to your question, whether he's major or minor, I think these are categories that make no sense.

22:32.512 --> 22:35.115
Well, I'm just picking up a phrase that was in your book.

22:35.135 --> 22:36.457
That's why I wrote it down.

22:37.638 --> 22:41.903
I once saw a description of Allen Ginsberg as a major minor poet.

22:42.264 --> 22:44.907
Yeah.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.609
The theme has been applied to Longfield.

22:46.829 --> 22:47.330
Is that right?

22:47.490 --> 22:47.870
Yeah.

22:48.090 --> 22:49.332
I don't know who it was.

22:49.412 --> 22:55.279
And then there was a review recently in the New York Times of the new edition of the Oxford Book of America.

22:55.259 --> 22:56.263
Poetry.

22:57.488 --> 23:05.018
And he says, let's face it, all American poetry of the 19th century prior to Whitman and Dickinson stinks.

23:05.078 --> 23:06.383
That's the word he uses.

23:06.768 --> 23:08.711
that reviewer.

23:08.751 --> 23:16.481
He basically says, you know, why even fool around with even including some of this stuff in this anthology?

23:16.682 --> 23:19.806
And, you know, so that is the attitude.

23:20.186 --> 23:22.490
Do you agree that that is still the attitude?

23:22.510 --> 23:26.515
I was pleased to see, and one of the great

23:26.495 --> 23:32.144
admirers and indeed fans in print.

23:32.165 --> 23:36.231
That's how I became acquainted with Daniel Aaron of the Library of America.

23:36.592 --> 23:39.938
And they did do a volume six years ago.

23:41.300 --> 23:41.660
J.D.

23:41.741 --> 23:45.707
McClatchy did a wonderful job on it.

23:45.767 --> 23:50.916
But it did take them a hundred volumes before they got to Longfellow.

23:50.896 --> 23:55.761
And the collection actually became quite successful.

23:55.861 --> 24:00.766
My editor of the Library of America, I did the Audubon volume for the Library of America.

24:00.786 --> 24:01.787
I love that book.

24:01.807 --> 24:02.828
I'm sorry.

24:02.928 --> 24:05.871
I apologize for not realizing that you did that.

24:06.832 --> 24:13.359
Well, that's really what I did before I came to Law School.

24:13.860 --> 24:17.123
And what I'm doing again, I'm returning to Audubon for...

24:17.710 --> 24:18.931
A couple of projects.

24:19.171 --> 24:21.634
I love Annie Fields, too, by the way.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.977
I did write about her a little bit in one of my books.

24:25.518 --> 24:32.325
Annie Adams Fields is a great interest of mine.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.707
Is that a publishing interest?

24:34.747 --> 24:43.836
I have a piece coming out in Raritan about her and Henry James in either the next issue or the one thereafter.

24:44.221 --> 24:52.309
So it's just sort of an offshoot and, again, triggered by books because I like these little beacon biographies.

24:52.389 --> 24:54.071
So are you a collector, by the way?

24:54.091 --> 24:54.852
Yes, I am.

24:55.432 --> 24:59.096
In a very, very modest sense because I don't have enough money.

24:59.116 --> 25:09.766
But I like these little beacon biographies that Mark DeWolf Howe did around the turn of the century.

25:09.786 --> 25:11.528
They're very expensive now.

25:11.812 --> 25:15.556
And Annie Fields did a little volume and also.

25:16.397 --> 25:18.559
And they're just beautiful little things.

25:18.579 --> 25:23.764
And just a hundred pages long, I guess, of the format.

25:23.784 --> 25:25.506
Some of them are very, very expensive.

25:25.526 --> 25:32.834
The one on Agassi is currently, I think, it's like $500 or $600 if you want to buy it.

25:32.854 --> 25:33.755
There's only very few.

25:34.335 --> 25:41.283
And that's the only book he ever wrote, actually, in that slide.

25:41.463 --> 25:41.683
So...

25:41.967 --> 25:50.639
But most of my interests are triggered by, you know, either wanting to own a book or seeing it at a library and being fascinated by it.

25:51.980 --> 25:56.667
Well, is it an artifactual thing with you?

25:56.707 --> 25:58.349
I mean, do you enjoy holding?

25:59.170 --> 26:00.091
Is there a tactile?

26:00.552 --> 26:01.253
Yes.

26:01.273 --> 26:02.254
There definitely is.

26:02.757 --> 26:08.505
You know, this is what I write about.

26:09.487 --> 26:13.853
Some of the Longfellow books don't look so great because they're standard Tickner and Field.

26:13.873 --> 26:14.434
They are.

26:14.454 --> 26:17.638
I've got a bunch of them, and you can get them in a pretty good place.

26:17.738 --> 26:22.846
I love the Blue and Cold edition of his poetry and the two volumes of his prose.

26:23.026 --> 26:27.212
I own those, and I've always wanted to own the...

26:27.698 --> 26:41.356
The addition of Hyperion with a photograph by Frith, which is really around $1,000 now, which is not affordable for me.

26:42.457 --> 26:45.141
But definitely something that I would like to have at some point.

26:45.461 --> 26:49.326
Do you have a sense of how he achieved so much celebrity?

26:49.707 --> 26:54.313
What accounts for his extraordinary fame?

26:55.002 --> 26:59.629
He never went out and did lectures as everyone else did.

27:01.232 --> 27:05.418
There was an aloofness to him, and yet an accessibility, as you point out.

27:05.919 --> 27:07.962
At the very beginning, a woman comes to his door.

27:09.184 --> 27:12.870
I think there's sort of a multiplicity of causes.

27:12.890 --> 27:16.335
One of them certainly is that he was very canny about managing his own business.

27:16.973 --> 27:18.455
affairs as a writer.

27:18.836 --> 27:23.181
And he intended to be a professional writer, is that right?

27:23.201 --> 27:24.703
He intended to be a professional writer.

27:24.724 --> 27:43.028
And as soon as he felt he was able to maintain himself, which in fact he was, he resigned from Harvard, which is something most people today would think is something you don't do.

27:43.068 --> 27:44.891
That was pretty good.

27:45.291 --> 27:45.732
Yeah.

27:46.387 --> 27:52.336
And so he was very canny when it came to managing his own rights as an author.

27:52.916 --> 28:07.798
But I think the real reason for success were that he managed, and McClatchy described that very well in a little piece he did for the New York Times Book Review.

28:08.559 --> 28:09.500
Which I have.

28:09.861 --> 28:10.902
That's excellent.

28:10.962 --> 28:15.769
In which he said that, you know, he gave, he came up with stories that

28:16.475 --> 28:17.677
people could relate to.

28:18.458 --> 28:20.441
He was a storyteller.

28:20.781 --> 28:21.342
Exactly.

28:21.823 --> 28:24.727
Remember, these are narrative poems.

28:24.747 --> 28:25.849
He's a narrative poet.

28:25.889 --> 28:33.741
And this is, of course, what also goes against the modernist idea of a poem, that a poem has to be concise and compressed and...

28:34.042 --> 28:36.007
It's difficult to figure out.

28:36.027 --> 28:36.649
Inaccessible.

28:37.030 --> 28:38.053
Yeah, exactly.

28:38.093 --> 28:44.029
I mean, Pound was much more of a relative of Longfellow than he realized when he looked at the cantos.

28:44.190 --> 28:49.063
And, you know, there you see the storyteller coming out and really wanting to.

28:49.043 --> 28:52.669
have as much space as he can to expatiate on things.

28:52.749 --> 28:55.633
Have you read all of Pound's cantos?

28:56.234 --> 28:58.538
At one time, yes.

28:58.898 --> 28:59.499
I haven't.

28:59.519 --> 28:59.960
I tried.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.021
I was in English major.

29:01.061 --> 29:01.863
Well, I did.

29:02.524 --> 29:07.912
You know, my dissertation came out of that, so I was kind of forced to do it.

29:08.092 --> 29:12.018
And there are parts of it I enjoy, but other parts, you know, unreadable.

29:12.339 --> 29:13.280
I was teaching it.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.362
I was just curious.

29:14.422 --> 29:15.844
Yeah, yeah.

29:16.178 --> 29:23.867
So as a storyteller, I suppose he just came up with the right things at the right time.

29:23.987 --> 29:36.041
And a poem like Evangelion, you know, this final image of the two lovers buried in the city that is a synonym for American independence.

29:36.902 --> 29:44.751
And with all this other people basically going about their business around them, the hearts that are throbbing and that are...

29:44.933 --> 29:49.279
You know, he has these very memorable lines about, you know, what ordinary people are like.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.503
And he captures that.

29:52.683 --> 30:07.422
And he gives them a story of displaced people, Evangeline and her lover, basically embodying a sense of insecurity that he felt most people also felt.

30:07.822 --> 30:10.125
You know what I love about that?

30:10.226 --> 30:14.451
And you have it in your book and others touch on it.

30:14.971 --> 30:24.620
And it goes back to what you're saying, not only about narrative and story, but, you know, I'm a journalist, basically, and I write books that thrive on storytelling.

30:25.801 --> 30:31.026
And he's sitting around, and he hears this story that Hawthorne hears about first.

30:31.546 --> 30:33.008
Hawthorne is not interested in it.

30:34.009 --> 30:35.670
And he says, well, maybe I can use it.

30:36.091 --> 30:38.773
Because he sees the story in it.

30:39.474 --> 30:43.037
And Hawthorne, I think, later was very rueful about it,

30:43.490 --> 30:46.073
Why didn't I do that?

30:47.795 --> 30:52.401
But he saw the possibilities of the storytelling.

30:53.282 --> 30:55.725
I don't know if you have his biography.

30:55.745 --> 30:57.267
I do, in fact, and I've read it.

30:57.347 --> 31:04.456
He has a very funny little aside on what would have happened to the story that happened and the fourth one had written it.

31:04.656 --> 31:10.003
Well, that's what I was just actually picking on, actually drawing on.

31:09.983 --> 31:13.888
I mean, I said that because I do have that book, in fact.

31:15.751 --> 31:19.215
So was his celebrity a phenomenon, do you think?

31:19.235 --> 31:21.458
I mean, he is the first great superstar.

31:21.758 --> 31:22.740
Yeah.

31:23.621 --> 31:34.455
Well, it also came from something else, I suppose, that in a sense made him, for me, a much more American writer than some of the...

31:35.077 --> 31:54.497
While at the same time he was the most European of all American writers, in another sense he was very American in that he thought of literature as a civic obligation, as something that a celebrity for him was not, you know, just stardom that came without any strings attached.

31:54.517 --> 32:02.805
It came with an obligation to handle his celebrity well and to be accessible to the people he wrote for.

32:03.545 --> 32:07.209
Well, how did he account for that accessibility?

32:08.130 --> 32:09.512
Answering letters that he got.

32:09.532 --> 32:09.972
So he did.

32:10.072 --> 32:12.074
So he did the correspondence.

32:12.174 --> 32:16.499
To an extent that... Because he didn't do the lectures as so many others did.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.120
Yeah.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.342
And to an extent that baffles people.

32:20.103 --> 32:28.152
Whittier at one point said in one of his letters that he thinks the letters that Longfield received finally killed him at the end.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.062
Whittier says this?

32:30.122 --> 32:30.363
Yes.

32:31.765 --> 32:33.507
I think I have that reference.

32:33.567 --> 32:38.474
If my index is correct, you might be able to find it.

32:38.514 --> 32:48.529
But in a letter written after Longfiller's death, Whittier, of course, was very frail at that time himself and was suffering from a similar sort of assault on his privacy.

32:49.750 --> 32:55.118
People fighting him, trying to, and his problem was different because he was actually...

32:55.317 --> 32:59.022
probably be vocal about all sorts of causes and people wanted to enlist him.

33:00.304 --> 33:07.434
But Longfellow would respond even to the most senseless queries.

33:07.474 --> 33:10.077
Well, you have the letter from the little girl in Ohio.

33:10.097 --> 33:10.698
Exactly.

33:11.399 --> 33:12.400
Which is wonderful.

33:12.621 --> 33:16.506
And he answers her with a well, beautifully written letter.

33:16.827 --> 33:17.688
Exactly, yes.

33:17.708 --> 33:18.088
Quotable.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.510
Perfectly, in fact.

33:19.791 --> 33:24.497
And that is something I actually... It became clear to me that even...

33:24.916 --> 33:50.637
It wasn't even clear to me when I wrote the book, when I was at Bowdoin, and I looked at some of what these young men were required to do in college, and how many of them, in the class of 1825 especially, ended up fulfilling public functions of some sort in Maine or elsewhere as lawyers and that

33:51.342 --> 33:53.505
as representatives and so on.

33:53.746 --> 34:10.470
Longfellow was part of a culture that, you know, implanted in him the idea that you give back what you receive and you do this in a didactic way, which is something also that marks his poetry and mars his poetry in the minds of many people who don't like him.

34:11.672 --> 34:15.578
But there was also a sense that you do what you do because...

34:15.929 --> 34:20.955
You have to, and you do it in such a sense that you are accountable for what you do.

34:21.696 --> 34:40.379
There's this beautiful story, which I think I mentioned in my book, just about the time that Evangelion had come out, when he goes to Cambridge and he buys a pair of shoes, and the clerk says to him, Mr. Longfellow, you're going to get some of that money back later today when I'm going to buy myself a copy of your poem.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.345
And he liked that idea.

34:46.000 --> 34:54.410
that this is sort of an exchange of goods in a sense, which also doesn't mean that literature is just a product.

34:54.430 --> 34:57.093
It means that you work on it.

34:57.254 --> 35:06.625
It means that you do your best and that you don't release something that doesn't fulfill certain criteria for craftsmanship, which is very important.

35:06.705 --> 35:15.636
And something else you point out in your book, and actually you lead with it, but people don't read poetry today, but poetry...

35:16.207 --> 35:22.433
You look at what people had to entertain themselves.

35:22.473 --> 35:26.978
They had story, they had lectures, they had whatever.

35:29.581 --> 35:33.985
These poems, they were best sellers.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.828
He even kept count of his own sales.

35:38.450 --> 35:39.171
Very carefully.

35:40.932 --> 35:42.754
He got the plates to his own books.

35:42.774 --> 35:43.595
It was amazing.

35:43.815 --> 35:45.437
He had a business sense, didn't he?

35:45.603 --> 35:47.847
An entrepreneurial sense, perhaps, even?

35:49.209 --> 35:53.516
Or a sense of his own value, monetary as well as cultural?

35:53.576 --> 35:54.597
I don't know.

35:55.419 --> 35:55.559
Yeah.

35:55.979 --> 36:03.391
I think, you know, one thing you always have to remember, too, is that he married the daughter of the Richard Campbell, Massachusetts.

36:03.411 --> 36:07.037
And while the Harvard professor was not a nobody,

36:07.405 --> 36:12.631
He was certainly not, you know, had the same social standing as Fanny Allen.

36:12.651 --> 36:20.219
Well, I don't know how many professors anywhere could move into the Craigley Mansion, you know, on Brattle Street.

36:20.419 --> 36:21.880
That's for sure.

36:22.001 --> 36:34.594
You also have to remember that most of the writers around him did have daytime jobs that they held on to.

36:34.912 --> 36:40.381
And Longfellow originally wanted to be a poet, and he told his father.

36:40.401 --> 36:45.389
Well, that letter to his father is extraordinary, which I will quote on my piece, by the way.

36:45.490 --> 36:47.773
You will be richly cited, by the way.

36:49.496 --> 36:50.979
It's an extraordinary letter.

36:52.441 --> 36:53.162
It's right there.

36:53.363 --> 36:55.406
He says what matters to him in life.

36:56.027 --> 37:00.835
It's a passage I did not quote in my book, which is extraordinarily moving.

37:01.085 --> 37:28.999
after his father's death, it's not in the published diaries, he goes back to Portland to clean up, well, basically to clean up his father's things, and there's a moment where he looks at his father's papers, he looks at his writing desk, and he just can't, I think he says, I don't remember the exact words, but

37:29.300 --> 37:30.341
How depressing.

37:31.342 --> 37:32.984
A small-time lawyer's life.

37:33.945 --> 37:35.527
The many petty affairs.

37:35.827 --> 37:40.392
He sees before, and this could have been his fate.

37:40.412 --> 37:43.155
His father wanted him to be a lawyer like he was one.

37:44.657 --> 37:51.865
And there is the specter of mediocrity that he escaped, but he still was a guy from Portland.

37:52.418 --> 37:54.702
In Cambridge.

37:54.722 --> 37:57.186
Well, he probably should have gone to Harvard, actually.

37:57.346 --> 37:59.790
I mean, I went to Bates up in Maine, by the way.

38:00.210 --> 38:05.038
But Bowdoin back in the, whenever he went there, Bates wasn't even in existence then.

38:05.178 --> 38:11.869
I mean, with his pedigree, I guess it was monetary as well.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.752
But I mean, I think it should have been at Harvard.

38:14.272 --> 38:26.428
I think there was also a little bit the idea that Bowden is a place where young men can be kept safe and away from the temptation.

38:27.009 --> 38:41.528
If you read Hawthorne's first novel, terrible novel, which is no longer really accessible, he writes about the temptation that college students are exposed to and Fanshawe.

38:41.930 --> 38:51.560
Which is, you know, from a bibliographical point, it's very, or the point of a bibliophile is very interesting, too, because it's so rare.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.181
What's the title of that one?

38:53.422 --> 38:56.024
Fanshawe.

38:56.505 --> 39:02.971
He had all copies except two or three, I guess, burned, because he was so embarrassed by it.

39:02.991 --> 39:04.813
And, of course, it was reissued and so on.

39:05.414 --> 39:09.658
And he writes about the temptations that one is exposed to, and there's...

39:10.111 --> 39:19.952
There's a guy that, you know, falls for everything that one can possibly fall for, including drink.

39:20.945 --> 39:29.177
So it's a memorable book because it's one of the first, I think, descriptions of a hangover in American literature.

39:29.418 --> 39:31.701
Now, something to interrupt here briefly.

39:31.922 --> 39:34.205
I know you've got your children there.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.068
You don't want to spend the night talking to me.

39:36.088 --> 39:42.457
But I certainly do want to make mention of your Houghton exhibition.

39:42.678 --> 39:45.662
And thank you, by the way, for sending that description.

39:45.682 --> 39:47.365
It's excellent.

39:47.605 --> 39:50.209
What are you trying to accomplish in this exhibition?

39:50.611 --> 40:18.340
The basic idea is to challenge the image of Longfellow as a sort of stuffy Victorian and to point out, A, that as a writer he was driven by a sense of extreme professionalism and that he was... and also...

40:19.315 --> 40:23.339
by a sense of duty, as I tried to explain earlier.

40:23.359 --> 40:28.304
So the readers and fans are part of that first goal.

40:28.965 --> 40:48.664
And the second goal is to also show that a kind of lighter side of him in his private, personal life, which involves, you know, the interactions, especially with the children, that are very interesting from

40:49.167 --> 41:05.632
even a social history point of view because he was what we would probably refer to today a new man, somebody who, as opposed to a new woman, somebody who took his obligations as a father very, very seriously and was incredibly available to his children.

41:07.675 --> 41:11.361
In a sense, in a way that was unusual for the time.

41:11.695 --> 41:14.718
So I'm going actually off in two different directions.

41:14.778 --> 41:30.095
I want to sort of reinvent him as a professional poet on the one hand and also emphasize how modern he was in the ways in which he arranged his personal life.

41:31.296 --> 41:34.380
These are the two goals that I want to combine.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.522
Will we get a sense of his celebrity?

41:37.413 --> 41:42.981
Yes, because there's a whole case devoted to a fan letter.

41:43.682 --> 41:51.494
And, of course, you have the jug there and a few other things, which are wonderful, aren't they?

41:51.514 --> 41:54.819
The cigar wrappers and stuff.

41:54.939 --> 41:55.540
Yeah, yeah.

41:56.009 --> 42:05.603
Extraordinarily, I think that quote from Queen Victoria, who certainly knew who he was, but she was so astonished that the servants knew who he was.

42:05.663 --> 42:06.884
That's exactly right.

42:06.904 --> 42:15.857
And that's what I meant when I said earlier, sort of the distinct human taste and appetite breaks down in this work, you know, because there's the servants reading him.

42:16.073 --> 42:20.260
I also have a letter by Anderson, Hans Christian Andersen.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.321
You have that.

42:21.582 --> 42:22.183
I enjoy that.

42:22.223 --> 42:24.126
He liked Anderson, and Anderson liked him.

42:24.146 --> 42:36.445
There's much more, apparently, because I started corresponding with somebody at the Anderson Center in Copenhagen, and there are Longfellow letters that she's been trying to track down for me, apparently.

42:36.678 --> 42:42.866
in several collections in Denmark, some of which this person thinks are written in Danish.

42:43.106 --> 42:44.568
Oh, that would be, well, he could do it.

42:44.848 --> 42:47.751
If anyone could, he could.

42:47.771 --> 42:49.013
It would be very interesting.

42:49.193 --> 43:03.090
Certainly, and he maintained a lifelong interest in Andersen, not just because he read the stories to his children, but because he had a shared love of Italy, which impressed Longfellow, even though

43:03.442 --> 43:13.856
He said that Anderson knew far less than he did, which, you know... You know, apparently Dickens came to spend a Thanksgiving dinner with him.

43:14.216 --> 43:14.436
Yeah.

43:14.857 --> 43:16.739
And I wonder, is there any record of that?

43:17.280 --> 43:23.408
You talk about, you had a meeting there, the breaking of bread.

43:23.911 --> 43:35.049
on the other side of the Atlantic, arguably the most celebrated man over there, and the most celebrated figure over here, getting together at Thanksgiving.

43:35.089 --> 43:38.955
Would you love to know what was discussed at that dinner?

43:39.455 --> 43:42.540
Is there any sort of a journal record of that that I could find, do you think?

43:43.462 --> 43:47.648
Annie Fields has written about Dickens and Longfellow.

43:48.550 --> 43:50.593
I don't think there is...

43:50.810 --> 43:58.780
The diaries talked much about words that were being... And Longfellow didn't really share much about his thoughts, did he?

43:58.800 --> 43:59.280
No, no.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.442
That's a problem, isn't it?

44:00.462 --> 44:04.026
His diaries are very focused on external things.

44:04.046 --> 44:08.372
Who came, who left, what was eaten, but not much about what was dead.

44:08.552 --> 44:13.678
In his reading last time, we know what he read, but we know very little about... Yeah.

44:13.658 --> 44:18.987
If you go by the reading list, you know, what the hell did you think about it?

44:19.027 --> 44:33.650
There's one way of, you know, finding out about this when it comes to books about Italy and Dante because a lot of these were mined for his notes, for his translation.

44:34.411 --> 44:38.738
And you see, and in some of these notes he's actually a little more

44:39.207 --> 44:49.018
scholarly than you do find him combining things, evaluating, quoting, and so on.

44:49.038 --> 44:52.642
But he'd pretty much given up writing essays at that point.

44:52.863 --> 45:02.934
Actually, really after the 1840s, there's no critical commentary from him anymore, except sometimes in letters.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.417
So it's very hard to assess

45:06.055 --> 45:11.645
um, how he responded to, uh, to books he, he read.

45:11.805 --> 45:13.669
And sometimes it's very disappointing.

45:14.410 --> 45:27.473
And, uh, there's a, there's a quote I, I sometimes use and, uh, in class, um, when he, um, visited Hawthorne once and, uh,

45:27.908 --> 45:35.298
Hawthorne was very depressed about his lack of popularity and his weary and everything else.

45:35.319 --> 45:40.486
And he said to Longfellow, apparently, I shall write no more tales.

45:41.267 --> 45:52.583
And Longfellow says, and that he records in his diary, I advise him to write up 100 in all and then give them a good round title such as,

45:53.069 --> 45:55.332
The Hundred Tales, or Century of Tales.

45:55.572 --> 45:56.794
Do you know what the heck he was doing?

45:56.834 --> 45:57.775
Let them go with that.

45:58.816 --> 46:08.768
You know, there's a book coming from Yale in a couple months, and I'm doing a book for Yale, so they gave me a reader's copy, but it's Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity.

46:09.449 --> 46:10.530
I heard about that.

46:10.911 --> 46:11.652
And it's pretty good.

46:11.672 --> 46:13.213
That's David, even Blake.

46:13.834 --> 46:13.954
Yeah.

46:13.974 --> 46:22.705
And, of course, he does have a long... He says, you know, flat out in there that Longfellow is the guy, and everybody else is...

46:22.685 --> 46:30.214
you know, this is Mount Everest and everything else is, you know, just in the Himalayan range.

46:30.655 --> 46:42.550
But apparently it really bothered Whitman, who so craved celebrity, that what do I have to do to get up there?

46:42.770 --> 46:45.954
Does he also write about Whitman keeping the stamp?

46:46.194 --> 46:50.039
Yes, he does.

46:50.380 --> 46:51.561
What does he make of that?

46:51.541 --> 46:55.787
He doesn't get into it in any great detail.

46:56.068 --> 46:57.570
I think it's just wonderful.

46:57.630 --> 47:05.202
He really gets into the butterfly image, you know, which I've spent too much time on.

47:06.323 --> 47:09.188
But it's a nice little thing.

47:09.448 --> 47:18.021
I'm talking, I'm not sure how much of it is accurate, but Peter Corviello, who...

47:18.355 --> 47:20.458
co-taught the seminar at Bowdoin with me.

47:20.558 --> 47:21.580
He was a Whitman expert.

47:22.120 --> 47:34.297
He said Whitman would even be concerned about, you know, how his virility would come across in photographs and pose and repose himself.

47:35.559 --> 47:39.605
Well, Longfellow really loved the photograph, didn't he?

47:39.645 --> 47:40.366
The daguerreotype.

47:42.048 --> 47:42.709
Yeah, yeah.

47:43.803 --> 47:46.647
It is interesting as I've up to Whitman.

47:46.727 --> 47:54.558
Whitman was questioned directly, in fact, on a couple of occasions about at least 48 years, too.

47:54.578 --> 47:55.479
Yeah, yeah.

47:55.620 --> 48:07.396
But apparently, I mean, not to become too graphic, but I heard a paper from someone who actually said that Whitman was, you know, concerned about how his privates would come across.

48:07.817 --> 48:09.739
You mean his actual privates?

48:10.260 --> 48:13.725
And asked for

48:14.296 --> 48:21.625
knew for repositioning that would, you know, help him in that quest.

48:22.146 --> 48:35.482
This is a guy working at Iowa and apparently has been comparing different versions of photographs and which is part of that whole celebrity issue, I suppose.

48:35.963 --> 48:37.805
Very, very interesting, though.

48:37.825 --> 48:43.172
There's also this wonderful meeting between Longfin and Whitman, which I'm sure you talked about, where

48:43.709 --> 48:55.466
Whitman was a little put off by how Shaman and Longfellow seemed like a lady, like somebody who'd been dressed by his wife.

48:55.526 --> 48:56.187
That's in there.

48:57.188 --> 49:03.878
But celebrity, it's a phenomenon that is just emerging at that time, isn't it?

49:03.898 --> 49:04.198
Yeah, yeah.

49:04.465 --> 49:10.673
And Mark Twain certainly becomes identified by his white suit, almost in a tumble kind of a way.

49:10.713 --> 49:16.100
I know the Mainest York Society is trying to do a little workshop about fame and longfilling.

49:16.120 --> 49:23.470
Yeah, well, they see something today, and I told them, I said, look, I'd love to help you, and I'll do what I can, but I'm not a scholar here.

49:23.550 --> 49:25.633
I gave your name to them.

49:25.653 --> 49:29.798
And I had a conversation with the guy, and I said, whatever I can do to help, but I don't see...

49:29.778 --> 49:32.262
what I could contribute to the discourse.

49:33.243 --> 49:35.286
I talk to people like Christoph.

49:35.427 --> 49:37.690
I don't do the work that they do.

49:37.830 --> 49:39.573
I think you would have been great for that.

49:40.514 --> 49:47.986
I watched Alan Trachtenberg, who is a great scholar, come to Greece a little bit last year.

49:49.348 --> 49:58.722
He was talking about his new book, Shades of Here or Other, which is about the interest in Native Americans.

49:59.377 --> 50:04.284
myths and how, you know, different ethnic groups were using them to represent themselves.

50:05.165 --> 50:13.637
And these guys, you know, people who attend these seminars, they are Longfellow fans.

50:13.677 --> 50:14.498
They're fanatical.

50:15.019 --> 50:16.662
They're local.

50:16.682 --> 50:17.603
They're local people.

50:17.643 --> 50:22.650
And they wanted to know whether Trachtenberg really likes Longfellow.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.590
And he said, well, I don't know.

50:25.610 --> 50:29.316
One lady said, you wrote a book about him.

50:29.616 --> 50:30.297
Do you like it?

50:30.758 --> 50:32.240
Or do you think it's dangerous stuff?

50:32.840 --> 50:33.221
Wow.

50:33.541 --> 50:37.888
And he said, well, I think it's done a lot of damage.

50:37.908 --> 50:43.796
And then somebody else said, what do you mean by damage?

50:43.916 --> 50:51.827
And then he said, well, it's sort of... And he really couldn't say why he felt it was harmful.

50:52.212 --> 51:11.301
And they were very sharp, and I like Alan a lot, and I like his book, but he clearly wasn't able to step out of this academic framework and confront people who have a passion for reading and who'd come to this because they wanted to know, and they wanted to know what he thought about this.

51:11.681 --> 51:18.892
And somebody said, well, Professor, just tell us, would you sit down and pick up Longfellow at night and read him?

51:19.873 --> 51:20.695
And he said, no.

51:20.975 --> 51:21.696
Well, would you?

51:22.199 --> 51:23.841
I do, actually.

51:23.901 --> 51:27.624
I have my favorites.

51:27.805 --> 51:29.426
I have poems that I return to.

51:29.506 --> 51:36.153
I think there are some poems that have a great deal of personal significance for me.

51:38.215 --> 51:44.521
Some of the later poems, especially, he writes about aging, like no other poet, really, including Ritman.

51:45.702 --> 51:51.328
And I find him very compelling when he writes about...

51:51.545 --> 52:04.651
One poem I keep coming back to, and that's the elegy he wrote for Hawthorne, which I think is just wonderful.

52:05.091 --> 52:06.153
It's simply called Hawthorne.

52:06.174 --> 52:12.085
It's a poem written to commemorate his funeral, and it's one of his most beautiful poems, I think.

52:12.385 --> 52:14.968
And even in that poem, there's a reference to Aladdin.

52:15.269 --> 52:20.956
So he always takes you a little bit out of the cultural framework that you're used to.

52:21.597 --> 52:28.767
And he sent this poem, which I think is very, very significant, you know, when you try to understand him.

52:29.347 --> 52:33.373
He sent it to Fields, James Fields, after the funeral.

52:33.393 --> 52:40.482
And he said, this is what I wrote, Did you not feel so likewise?

52:41.003 --> 52:41.143
Mm-hmm.

52:41.579 --> 52:44.822
And that's sort of the idea that drives this poetry.

52:44.862 --> 52:49.026
It's not really something that we're used to applying to poetry.

52:49.747 --> 52:52.350
You know, that it's about feelings that we share.

52:53.831 --> 53:06.524
When you read, by contrast, the poem that Melville wrote for Hawthorne, so most people think it was Hawthorne, you were talking about it, it's simply called Monody.

53:07.004 --> 53:10.067
And it's just, it's naked despair in the poem, and it's

53:10.283 --> 53:13.309
Never its own despair about having lost thoughts on.

53:13.810 --> 53:21.584
It's nothing about feelings that can be shared by all people who have feelings.

53:22.285 --> 53:30.300
It's about my own despair, which is much more accessible to people who come out of this modernist idea of what literature is supposed to accomplish.

53:31.293 --> 53:32.936
I think, at least.

53:33.216 --> 53:39.946
And, you know, it kind of forces us to sort of step back a little bit and think about literature differently.

53:40.507 --> 53:46.416
So do you think the modernist view continues to hold sway?

53:46.436 --> 53:48.159
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:48.179 --> 53:56.311
And it's not much likelihood that Longfellow will make any kind of a recovery, you think?

53:56.331 --> 54:00.017
Or will he continue to be this marginal figure?

54:00.487 --> 54:07.333
I don't see much of a chance in English department context, really.

54:07.373 --> 54:28.873
Simply because the very idea that literary history is something that's always about the kind of idea that we have to make it new is so ingrained in the heads of

54:29.866 --> 54:51.350
In what we've been taught, that we cannot, that we have no room for a poet who looks at the past and recycles it in his work and reuses what he finds elsewhere, as he did, you know, you mentioned the Evangeline story and so on.

54:51.870 --> 54:53.793
This is not something that we are used to.

54:53.813 --> 54:58.658
We are much more comfortable with somebody like Whitman or Pound or

54:59.060 --> 55:16.960
and it's very interesting that in spite of the many critical schools and the many sort of theoretical turns that the academy has gone through, we still hold on to the idea that this is how literature has to work.

55:17.841 --> 55:24.949
I think that there is a chance for recovering a little bit

55:25.925 --> 55:37.065
in schools, which is one of the reasons why I was so happy when I was invited to do this NEH seminar.

55:37.746 --> 55:49.266
Longfellow poems can be taught very well if you move away from the memorization thing and so on, because poems are well made.

55:49.955 --> 55:55.281
And you can talk about them in very accessible, very interesting terms.

55:55.381 --> 56:12.260
Even a poem like The Rite of Paul Revere, which has been read so much and taught so much, you can approach it very simply as a sort of, here's the story that Longfellow wants to tell, and the aesthetic challenge is the story that takes place at night.

56:12.981 --> 56:15.464
How do you write a poem about something that happens at night?

56:16.505 --> 56:18.107
That is a challenge.

56:18.127 --> 56:18.247
It is.

56:18.287 --> 56:19.168
How do you do it?

56:19.385 --> 56:30.576
And then you can look at how he represents sound, how he works with sound, how, you know, the hoof tabs or whatever, how he works with light and so on.

56:30.636 --> 56:35.862
And you see all of a sudden that this is a really interestingly made, well-made poem.

56:36.302 --> 56:42.048
It's not a poem that you have to step back and revere, no pun intended.

56:42.869 --> 56:45.291
But it's a poem that...

56:46.199 --> 56:54.950
that is just a good, well-made object that can teach you something about how you yourself should approach your own writing.

56:56.151 --> 57:01.097
And there is a chance for recovery that I think is very real.

57:01.257 --> 57:12.671
And the echo that we had from the 35 to 40 school teachers who attended our seminar, I think, proved me right.

57:13.853 --> 57:14.113
And

57:15.798 --> 57:20.682
And there, I think, is a real opportunity for us to get back to Longfellow.

57:20.822 --> 57:29.149
And the other opportunity, of course, and this is even something that might happen in the academy as well, if that is important at all.

57:29.370 --> 57:32.652
I still think that it's more important what readers out there think.

57:33.713 --> 57:42.020
The kind of transnational angle, the international angle, to me is very important.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.163
And more important today than ever before, because

57:45.464 --> 58:08.502
Here's a writer who thinks about the world not in terms of the superiority of the Anglican mentality and race, which is something that even Whitman and Mel would subscribe to, but thinks about it in terms of shared cultural interests.

58:09.443 --> 58:14.192
Any change of interest, even which is why translation was so important to him.

58:14.212 --> 58:25.934
So, let me just, because I've taken up a full hour of your time here, Richard, I'm interested in what you feel when you walk into the Longfellow House over there on Brattle Street.

58:26.695 --> 58:30.743
You talk about a place giving you some sense of the person there.

58:31.111 --> 58:32.052
Yeah.

58:32.072 --> 58:35.516
Is that anything at all that resonates with you?

58:35.776 --> 58:37.978
Well, the first thing I look at is books, of course.

58:37.999 --> 58:39.260
And I see books everywhere.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.403
And that for me is... Four thousand books there, I think, of his.

58:42.423 --> 58:42.563
Right.

58:43.184 --> 58:49.131
And that is a feeling, an instant feeling of at-homeness when I walk into that place.

58:50.492 --> 58:58.821
Because here is somebody who surrounds himself with books and who cannot have enough of them.

58:59.322 --> 58:59.582
And...

58:59.984 --> 59:04.188
For me, that's the most powerful sort of rapport that I have with him.

59:05.029 --> 59:11.755
I like his study.

59:12.455 --> 59:26.268
What I find very interesting, there's a famous photograph of Longfellow sitting, he seems kind of asleep, next to his desk.

59:26.328 --> 59:29.791
He went to get a statuette there, right?

59:29.911 --> 59:29.991
Yes.

59:30.730 --> 59:34.994
I like the fact that it's a round desk that he uses.

59:35.134 --> 59:38.638
It's not one of those traditional, you know, writing desks.

59:38.838 --> 59:50.870
It's almost like something you would find in a parlor, which shows again sort of how these two things come together, you know, writing as a profession, but also something that, you know, other people can do and relate to.

59:50.890 --> 01:00:00.720
So it's both something that I do very well, but something also that I, you know, share with people other than me who might not be writers

01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:07.562
There's something, you know, demonic about that as far as I'm concerned.

01:00:07.582 --> 01:00:17.214
I like the study very much because it's a workplace for him, but it's also a place where you still feel the presence of the family.

01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:28.868
And that brings together the two things that I want to explore in my exhibition to, you know, the workmanlike aspect of his work, and yet...

01:00:29.371 --> 01:00:33.918
the familiarity that it also has, literally.

01:00:34.419 --> 01:00:36.001
I like that very much.

01:00:36.962 --> 01:00:38.004
It's inseparable.

01:00:38.445 --> 01:00:52.546
The whole thing is inseparable for me, at least, from the work that people like Jimmy Fay and others are doing, who've made that house a hospitable and open place.

01:00:52.706 --> 01:00:53.287
It's wonderful.

01:00:53.467 --> 01:00:56.852
Like few other places I've experienced.

01:00:56.872 --> 01:00:57.353
They are...

01:00:58.008 --> 01:01:17.265
extremely dedicated people, all of them, Paul Blanford, Nancy Jones, Anita Israel, Jim Shea, but they also constantly think about ways of getting more people to become involved in the House with a dedication that I've never seen anywhere.

01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:23.010
and Jim Shea is a scholar in his own right.

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.451
Yeah, he's terrific, actually.

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:26.333
He was the one that got me interested in this, by the way.

01:01:26.413 --> 01:01:27.474
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:27.494 --> 01:01:29.736
Listen, I'm going to let you go, Professor.

01:01:30.617 --> 01:01:33.060
Don't call me that.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.400
Okay.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:47.674
What I will suggest is why don't I get back in touch with you after I've had a chance to go through this tape, work on the piece, and I'd be more than happy to run your quotes by anything that I use so you can have a chance to...

01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:53.000
Maybe amend them or whatever you'd like to do with them.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:53.502
Oh, sure.

01:01:54.184 --> 01:01:54.826
I'm sure.

01:01:55.287 --> 01:01:58.556
Well, you know, I'd like to get it right, too.

01:01:59.098 --> 01:01:59.319
Yeah.

01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:00.482
But feel free to call.
