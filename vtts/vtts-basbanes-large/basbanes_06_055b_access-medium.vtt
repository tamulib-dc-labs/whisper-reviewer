WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:05.969
An hour in each side.

00:06.570 --> 00:10.918
Yeah, but we shut it off if we go on.

00:12.321 --> 00:19.093
You asked if we collected book planes.

00:19.113 --> 00:19.554
Yeah.

00:19.574 --> 00:23.581
And I said no, but we collect booksellers and book fonders tickets.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.747
You know the little tickets they put in?

00:26.997 --> 00:29.840
Books found by, don't know, or sold by.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.702
Oh, those little, little, little things.

00:31.963 --> 00:34.125
I'll show you something wonderful.

00:34.145 --> 00:34.986
I can find it.

00:35.066 --> 00:36.268
I'm a vast collection.

00:36.288 --> 00:37.429
No, why then?

00:38.470 --> 00:39.671
They're part of the book trade.

00:39.711 --> 00:41.894
They're interesting typographically.

00:42.114 --> 00:44.537
Remember, I'm a printer, which we haven't discussed at all.

00:44.557 --> 00:46.379
Which I wanted to get into, by the way.

00:46.399 --> 00:50.824
And we also have a large collection of circulating library tickets.

00:50.844 --> 00:56.110
We have rewards of merit, watch paper, and assorted ephemera.

00:56.326 --> 00:59.730
Is there a difference between a collection and a library?

01:00.070 --> 01:05.096
A library, I mean, I read, was it John Carter or something like that?

01:05.116 --> 01:10.682
He says that a library has a further implication for general dissemination.

01:10.782 --> 01:11.703
Something like that.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.186
Whereas a collection is an expression of a private.

01:15.087 --> 01:16.068
Could that be the difference?

01:16.088 --> 01:20.834
I think that's probably a little bit too.

01:21.675 --> 01:23.717
To get back to that one question that was,

01:24.794 --> 01:27.778
You've never become, I don't mean, bored.

01:28.098 --> 01:29.180
Absolutely not.

01:30.061 --> 01:37.210
If ever I'm bored with anything else, which I never, as it happened, I would come into the library and start looking at stuff, and I would be enchanted.

01:38.052 --> 01:40.014
I love the stuff we've got.

01:40.795 --> 01:43.198
How did the day start with you?

01:44.500 --> 01:44.961
I work.

01:44.981 --> 01:45.762
I don't work.

01:45.962 --> 01:48.065
I make a living as an artist, you know.

01:48.285 --> 01:49.347
That's what I'm saying.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.971
I'm not a rich dilettante who pokes around, you know, this and that.

01:53.712 --> 01:54.193
I work.

01:54.511 --> 01:57.855
I work at collecting, too.

01:58.256 --> 02:06.166
But you get up in the morning with the idea that I have to go do some artwork today.

02:06.306 --> 02:07.828
That's right, every day.

02:07.848 --> 02:10.732
And that's the first impulse.

02:10.792 --> 02:14.276
And then you are active as a printer as well.

02:15.678 --> 02:16.018
Yes.

02:16.599 --> 02:18.742
I'm not a pressman, I'm a printer.

02:18.762 --> 02:20.324
I understand that.

02:21.025 --> 02:23.708
You've had that for quite a few years.

02:24.127 --> 02:27.972
There was a time for over 25, 30 years when I actually had a plant.

02:28.813 --> 02:29.594
I've given that up.

02:29.614 --> 02:33.159
That's a money loser of colossal proportions.

02:33.179 --> 02:34.200
And that was where it worked at?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.962
In Northampton.

02:35.982 --> 02:38.806
But we had that built in this one.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.128
But no one works there.

02:40.188 --> 02:43.332
We had a full-time present.

02:43.352 --> 02:45.715
So we had to pay him his wages week in, week out.

02:46.476 --> 02:48.158
That was appropriate.

02:48.178 --> 02:49.820
How many titles did you do?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.923
130 there in the bibliography.

02:53.658 --> 02:57.583
1992 will be the 50th anniversary of the Gahanna Press.

02:57.603 --> 02:58.825
50th anniversary.

02:59.426 --> 03:17.571
There's going to be a series of celebratory exhibitions all across the U.S., beginning, I don't know, perhaps at Southern Methodist University, California colleges, going on to the Library of Congress, Pittsburgh, at the Morgan, at the Mellon, Carnegie University.

03:17.611 --> 03:19.213
Would you remember to invite me to one of these days?

03:19.233 --> 03:19.513
Sure.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.496
I'll remind you.

03:21.516 --> 03:22.197
Princeton.

03:23.122 --> 03:34.534
And how long have you had the press?

03:37.036 --> 03:46.186
I started the press.

03:46.206 --> 03:49.129
50 years?

03:49.295 --> 03:50.616
Fifty years.

03:50.636 --> 03:54.519
In 1990, I started printing when I was a student in New Haven.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.122
Yeah.

03:57.142 --> 03:57.422
Wow.

03:58.163 --> 04:00.605
Are you going to publish something appropriate?

04:00.625 --> 04:03.747
We're thinking about, well, there's going to be a catalog.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.429
Colin Franklin is writing it, actually.

04:05.449 --> 04:05.769
Who is?

04:05.969 --> 04:06.870
Colin Franklin.

04:07.511 --> 04:12.555
He's writing his books out.

04:13.356 --> 04:14.457
He's a brilliant writer.

04:14.677 --> 04:15.077
Do you know him?

04:15.097 --> 04:15.738
Have you read him?

04:16.178 --> 04:18.340
He just wrote his name.

04:19.028 --> 04:20.270
That's the same fella?

04:20.290 --> 04:23.576
Yeah, he's written the only... That's the guy whose phone number you gave me, right?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.240
Yeah, it's the only literate bookseller we really know.

04:26.260 --> 04:29.766
I mean, he's really... He's written the only good book on the private press.

04:30.949 --> 04:33.713
Wonderful book called The Private Press.

04:33.733 --> 04:37.520
He's written a book on Ashley, Dustin Allen for Brickville.

04:38.181 --> 04:40.966
He's done a book on Aquatines.

04:40.986 --> 04:42.268
Marvelous guy.

04:44.375 --> 04:46.578
He was the director of Routless King and Paul.

04:46.598 --> 04:47.219
You know that?

04:47.239 --> 04:47.799
I know that.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.320
Oh, sir.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.242
They had an office in Boston there for a while.

04:50.983 --> 04:55.109
Well, in its greatest days, he was their managing director.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.050
That's it.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.132
He was one of those English aristocrats.

04:58.153 --> 04:59.915
You were just a kid when you started the press.

05:00.736 --> 05:01.056
I didn't know.

05:02.278 --> 05:03.660
Yeah, I was 19.

05:04.741 --> 05:07.064
Well, how did this come about?

05:07.304 --> 05:08.105
It's reading blank.

05:10.889 --> 05:11.349
This is all.

05:11.469 --> 05:12.711
You've got to read about me.

05:13.973 --> 05:25.156
What the hell is the name of the book?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.143
It has nothing on the spot.

05:32.792 --> 05:35.037
Nothing at all?

05:37.480 --> 06:02.813
I'm going to shut this off while you're looking.

06:03.485 --> 06:08.953
Let me ask you a question, Lisa.

06:08.973 --> 06:09.053
Yes.

06:11.116 --> 06:15.862
Now, do you have specific things that you have to get from collecting?

06:16.122 --> 06:16.303
No.

06:16.903 --> 06:17.084
No.

06:17.104 --> 06:23.653
I mean, I'm not, I don't collect, first of all, it's such an enormous area.

06:23.693 --> 06:29.461
I do not specialize in suffrage in 19th century American history, though I have quite a bit of it.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.804
I'm really interested in the

06:32.054 --> 06:37.759
political, social, and intellectual history of women from the 16th century on.

06:37.819 --> 06:40.001
The books are not necessarily written by women.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.463
Women can be the subject matter as well.

06:43.844 --> 06:50.710
Because, so, there is no bibliography.

06:51.651 --> 06:53.693
There is no bibliography that one can turn to.

06:54.474 --> 06:55.675
Slowly people are doing work.

06:55.755 --> 07:01.740
I mean, a woman called Dale Spender did a book called Mothers of the Novels.

07:02.193 --> 07:05.638
women novelists before Jane Austen.

07:05.658 --> 07:09.062
A hundred women novelists before Jane Austen.

07:11.466 --> 07:23.462
And that book, though academic scholars scorn the book and scorn some of her work, I find that book enormously interesting because she's done bibliographical work.

07:24.163 --> 07:29.570
She's made short bibliographies of all the women that she's discovered.

07:29.590 --> 07:30.732
Amelia Opie wrote

07:31.032 --> 07:34.716
about a novel based on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft.

07:34.876 --> 07:38.400
I didn't know that until I read about it in Dale Spender's book.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.404
Maybe that's something you should do, you know.

07:41.804 --> 07:42.465
It's endless.

07:43.146 --> 07:43.747
It really is endless.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.828
But it's a good bibliography.

07:45.709 --> 07:46.129
Of what?

07:46.710 --> 07:47.291
It's enormous.

07:47.311 --> 07:48.652
I'm not a bibliographer.

07:48.912 --> 07:50.314
That's not my interest.

07:50.394 --> 07:51.636
Every good book collector is a bibliographer.

07:51.656 --> 07:53.077
No, I'm not a bibliographer.

07:53.097 --> 08:00.786
I've started collecting a woman called Helen Maria Williams just in the past three or so years.

08:01.593 --> 08:12.386
Helen Mariah Williams was a woman who lived in the 18th century, an English woman, who went to live in France during the Revolution, was jailed.

08:14.849 --> 08:28.866
If you look up Helen Mariah Williams in the DMV, you'll find a very nasty, though quite extensive, biographical notice, where the writer

08:30.263 --> 08:33.046
says, how dare this woman write about ideas?

08:33.146 --> 08:33.607
Who is she?

08:33.627 --> 08:34.548
She's a mere woman.

08:35.088 --> 08:37.190
And she's telling us about the French Revolution.

08:37.230 --> 08:48.883
Well, it turns out, according to French sources, that the most accurate reporting of the French Revolution that was carried to England was carried by Helen Maria Williams and Tom Paine.

08:50.104 --> 08:54.669
In her books, she wrote 12 volumes on the French Revolution.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.731
She was a friend of Mary Wollstonecraft.

08:57.212 --> 09:00.135
Wollstonecraft scholars, historically,

09:00.655 --> 09:03.679
They write a page or two about Helena Rothstein.

09:03.739 --> 09:04.520
And how did you come on to?

09:05.060 --> 09:06.061
I came on to her.

09:06.081 --> 09:12.709
I had bought some books of hers, willy-nilly, and became interested in her.

09:12.729 --> 09:19.037
And then Madeline Stern and Leona Rostenberg had a great cache of her books and would feed me her books.

09:19.097 --> 09:22.241
And since then, I've been able to buy some letters of hers, et cetera.

09:22.761 --> 09:24.323
Nobody's done any work on her.

09:24.343 --> 09:25.705
Could I talk to Rostenberg as well?

09:25.745 --> 09:26.766
Do you mind if I mention that?

09:26.786 --> 09:27.507
No, no, certainly.

09:28.229 --> 09:28.950
I adore them.

09:28.970 --> 09:29.631
They're wonderful.

09:29.711 --> 09:32.374
I wish I had known them 40 years ago.

09:32.394 --> 09:33.195
I mean, they're dead.

09:33.415 --> 09:37.661
I mean, I feel terrible when I don't owe them money, you know.

09:37.681 --> 09:41.866
Sure, I've just bought a wonderful book from the Dahini collection from Leon and Madeleine.

09:41.886 --> 09:48.895
I bought a beautiful 16th century book of all the writings of Marguerite of Navarre.

09:48.915 --> 09:50.277
Marguerite.

09:50.297 --> 09:51.098
Marguerite?

09:51.118 --> 09:52.539
Marguerite of Navarre.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.682
A beautiful copy with woodcuts.

09:54.722 --> 09:57.105
This is a book that crosses

09:57.963 --> 10:07.658
because it has, it's a beautiful piece of French 16th century book making, illustrated with woodcuts by .

10:07.678 --> 10:14.028
You know, you just demonstrated, well, I haven't seen that, but it is interesting.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.191
You know everything that you have.

10:16.660 --> 10:18.382
Oh, yeah.

10:18.442 --> 10:21.927
And for the most part, you can put your hand on it.

10:22.168 --> 10:25.953
But of course, it's interesting.

10:26.073 --> 10:28.336
I completely forgot it's in the box, but I was going to show you.

10:28.476 --> 10:32.782
But when we talk about catalogs and using the catalogs to locate things.

10:32.802 --> 10:34.725
Yeah, you have a catalog to locate things.

10:35.446 --> 10:36.227
This is a book.

10:36.588 --> 10:37.970
Because you wouldn't mind the books.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.373
It's in grateful shape that I'm keeping the music.

10:40.775 --> 10:46.342
This is no great, but it's of no great interest to me.

10:46.443 --> 10:46.743
1673.

10:46.763 --> 10:47.083
1673.

10:47.224 --> 10:51.770
It's a nice collection, but I own it.

10:51.790 --> 10:56.716
It's a nice travel book, but I own it because... Books printed in London.

10:56.937 --> 10:58.078
Inserted inside it.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.481
A little catalog.

11:00.982 --> 11:03.205
And actually sold by Elizabeth Hutchinson.

11:03.586 --> 11:04.707
I mean, this is her style.

11:05.277 --> 11:08.722
And how did you find them?

11:08.842 --> 11:21.481
Did you go out?

11:22.122 --> 11:22.803
Yeah.

11:24.085 --> 11:26.068
We met, incidentally, at the school bridge.

11:26.448 --> 11:27.430
At the book fair.

11:27.710 --> 11:30.254
Which is not, as book fairs go, is not a major book fair.

11:30.334 --> 11:32.938
But I always managed to find them.

11:33.121 --> 11:35.344
Well, I can find that kind of stuff there.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.726
And I can find who knows what.

11:36.746 --> 11:38.409
In fact, I found a nice little early book.

11:38.429 --> 11:39.210
I don't find good books.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.371
No, I didn't find that.

11:40.712 --> 11:43.656
But I believe I got a great book of the Boston books there.

11:43.676 --> 11:47.141
But it's a book I've never seen or heard of.

11:47.161 --> 11:48.383
Got a wonderful book.

11:50.766 --> 11:54.011
It's a book on the movement of water.

11:55.413 --> 11:59.719
It's a book on the movement of water.

12:03.108 --> 12:09.715
Do you bid at options?

12:10.115 --> 12:12.097
No.

12:12.117 --> 12:12.337
Yes.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.538
Lisa maybe does, I don't.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.662
I don't buy or sell at auction by and large.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.124
I have some funny stories.

12:19.144 --> 12:25.610
I mean, I was going to bid at Sotheby's, I got a catalog, the Sotheby's sale, and there was something that was catalogued.

12:26.491 --> 12:28.873
Les raisons des forces mouvantes.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.415
It's about...

12:30.884 --> 12:38.412
It's a scientific book about the mechanics of moving water so you can have fountains and grottoes and stuff like that.

12:38.432 --> 12:40.454
You can't go ahead and say, excuse me.

12:40.514 --> 12:42.716
Now, this man, Salomon de Caus.

12:43.057 --> 12:44.078
C-A-B-S.

12:44.098 --> 12:45.199
I know that name.

12:45.219 --> 12:45.599
C-A-U.

12:45.619 --> 12:46.420
What's a U?

12:46.440 --> 12:47.221
C-A-U-S.

12:47.922 --> 12:51.846
He is famous for having done a great perspective book, which I never could find.

12:52.446 --> 12:57.672
But my friend, Timothy Trace, the great bookseller who lived in Peaksville, New York, had a copy in his personal collection.

12:57.692 --> 12:58.373
So I knew it.

12:58.913 --> 12:59.794
Yeah.

13:00.162 --> 13:05.309
In fact, it was used originally for that perspective, although I haven't found this copy to look this up.

13:05.329 --> 13:06.531
You see it's been crossed out here.

13:06.551 --> 13:07.933
It's been scraped out.

13:07.973 --> 13:09.155
Here on the block, do you think?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.778
On the plate, on the plate, on the plate.

13:11.999 --> 13:16.085
Okay, so this is such a book about machinery, right?

13:16.505 --> 13:19.089
About the movement of water, about water wheels.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.751
Fundamentally, it's boring.

13:20.952 --> 13:23.475
It's not really boring.

13:23.515 --> 13:24.837
It's boring.

13:25.154 --> 13:30.262
It has wonderful things, for example, about... Well, I like these things of machinery.

13:30.322 --> 13:31.383
But you knew this before?

13:31.403 --> 13:31.884
No.

13:31.904 --> 13:32.645
Oh, never saw it?

13:32.665 --> 13:33.707
Never saw a reference to it?

13:33.787 --> 13:35.069
I've never seen it in a catalog.

13:35.089 --> 13:39.676
I've never seen any... And since we bought it... I haven't been able to find out anything about it.

13:39.816 --> 13:39.976
Nothing.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.478
But it's the second set.

13:41.499 --> 13:42.981
The second set, that's interesting.

13:43.021 --> 13:46.346
Although there are things on mechanical music, like, you know... That's wonderful.

13:46.386 --> 13:48.709
Yeah, this is like a tableau revampus, like automata, isn't it?

13:48.729 --> 13:51.494
How they're animated, in this case, with water.

13:51.514 --> 13:52.495
Now, this is a music...

13:53.099 --> 14:19.360
like a new player piano yeah what's the day i'm listening 16 1810 be careful can i read that yes you see the price they were asking for i won't mention that no but i'm just telling you about that's not i didn't pay that for it mm-hmm i didn't swap i swapped that's the best play that's 1624 paris

14:20.099 --> 14:23.706
Yeah, but let me show you what's interesting.

14:23.786 --> 14:25.349
All right, so this is, these are quite interesting.

14:25.369 --> 14:33.064
These are all music, still music, but okay, then they, actually this is one of the details, and here's the actual music that plays.

14:33.545 --> 14:35.829
It's up and down, right?

14:37.012 --> 14:38.535
It's rather interesting.

14:38.555 --> 14:42.883
Well, then you get to the second volume, and this is the second edition of this volume.

14:43.235 --> 14:43.896
Here we go.

14:44.176 --> 14:50.807
Now we come to the second, which is in the first edition, which is earlier than, as you see, in 1615, this is later.

14:51.588 --> 14:53.791
There's 20, but it's the second printing of the first part.

14:54.412 --> 14:56.776
It's dedicated to Elizabeth of England.

14:58.318 --> 14:59.500
Brian?

14:59.540 --> 15:04.307
Oh, what's the date on it again?

15:04.347 --> 15:04.828
1615.

15:05.068 --> 15:06.510
Yeah, but she's been dead for 12 years.

15:07.232 --> 15:08.854
Did she die in... 1603.

15:09.391 --> 15:10.733
This is the princess.

15:10.753 --> 15:11.293
Oh, princess.

15:11.373 --> 15:11.894
I'm sorry.

15:11.914 --> 15:13.196
It's not the queen.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.297
It's not the queen.

15:14.457 --> 15:15.118
This is the princess.

15:15.178 --> 15:17.881
Princess is the princess.

15:18.242 --> 15:19.383
This is not the queen.

15:20.164 --> 15:24.209
Okay, and this is a grotto, right, with fountains and all sorts of stuff.

15:24.249 --> 15:25.150
Look at this place.

15:26.232 --> 15:29.055
Here is one of these balls going up on a fountain.

15:29.095 --> 15:29.596
Wait a minute.

15:29.616 --> 15:30.137
You see that?

15:30.177 --> 15:34.622
All around are chameleons, monsters, and various creatures which ship.

15:35.463 --> 15:39.229
Making a star around the water jet.

15:39.289 --> 15:40.891
Making that ball stay in the air.

15:40.911 --> 15:42.394
The ball stays in the air from there.

15:42.414 --> 15:43.435
That is fascinating.

15:43.455 --> 15:44.957
That is a fabulous plate.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.242
That plate really knocked me for a loop.

15:48.363 --> 15:50.005
You saw this when you saw the book?

15:50.025 --> 15:52.689
I mean, did you take this much time to go through a plate for a plate?

15:52.809 --> 15:56.836
I just looked at it and saw that it was an incredibly interesting book.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.179
Then I found one other plate which knocked me.

15:59.199 --> 15:59.880
I'll show it to you.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.723
There's this cancel, which is interesting.

16:02.446 --> 16:05.030
This is some model of some fast work.

16:05.090 --> 16:14.687
But the other plate that's fabulous is this plate of a cave with Apollo.

16:15.949 --> 16:18.894
Apollo.

16:20.176 --> 16:24.443
This is an automaton, you see, worked by music, worked by water.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.226
He plays his fiddle.

16:26.813 --> 16:28.995
Meanwhile, their animals are charmed.

16:29.015 --> 16:29.896
Do you see the animals?

16:30.177 --> 16:31.999
Every nook and cranny, there are animals.

16:32.119 --> 16:33.240
What kinds of plates are these?

16:33.380 --> 16:35.042
These are copper plates.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.745
Do you see these animals everywhere?

16:37.765 --> 16:40.408
I even know where most of them are copied from.

16:41.809 --> 16:43.471
But they're in every nook and cranny.

16:43.491 --> 16:47.696
You see these alligators in the owl up there?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.598
That's actually a way, huh?

16:50.287 --> 16:51.208
Gorgeous.

16:51.228 --> 16:52.469
The book is unknown.

16:52.730 --> 16:56.774
And this hits you as an artist, as a collector, as a printer?

16:56.934 --> 17:01.960
It hits me on every level, on all levels, because it's a book of vast interest.

17:02.380 --> 17:02.881
And unknown.

17:02.941 --> 17:04.623
It's peculiar and unknown to me.

17:04.643 --> 17:06.505
I've looked through all the catalogs I own.

17:06.565 --> 17:07.366
I can't find it.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.408
How about the fellow that sold it to you?

17:09.428 --> 17:10.570
Did he know anything about it?

17:10.590 --> 17:11.270
Not too much.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.993
Look, you see how... He had no bibliographical reference.

17:14.013 --> 17:14.814
He had nothing.

17:14.834 --> 17:20.040
He says, the second part of the film is a worthy companion to

17:20.982 --> 17:21.983
to Faldus.

17:22.284 --> 17:27.050
That has as much to do with Faldus Fountains of Rome as I have with Ivan Zandorff.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.074
Salomon, S-A-L-O, Degas.

17:30.135 --> 17:33.780
M-O-N, D-E, Svaldi, C-A-U-S.

17:35.382 --> 17:36.904
He doesn't know anything about it, you see.

17:37.104 --> 17:46.137
Les raisons, les forces, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les raisons, les forces of movement, right?

17:46.157 --> 17:46.737
Diverse machines.

17:46.757 --> 17:48.660
And they're clever booksellers, these guys.

17:49.687 --> 17:52.093
The two Johns in Williamsburg.

17:52.113 --> 17:52.694
Do you know them?

17:53.436 --> 17:53.536
No.

17:53.576 --> 17:55.641
They're very hot, very clever guys.

17:56.082 --> 17:56.443
What is this?

17:56.463 --> 17:57.024
I'm going to have this.

17:57.044 --> 17:58.066
This is a piece of shit.

17:58.106 --> 17:59.389
We're going to have redone.

17:59.630 --> 18:00.211
You're going to do it.

18:00.231 --> 18:01.053
Nineteenth century.

18:01.073 --> 18:02.196
I'm going to put a new one on.

18:02.216 --> 18:04.000
That'll be pleasing.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.338
How about tree?

18:05.419 --> 18:08.443
It hasn't boxed, which is extraordinary for three centuries.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.104
Watch the box.

18:09.124 --> 18:10.385
It's perfectly good paper.

18:10.405 --> 18:11.747
It's as good as the day it was made.

18:11.767 --> 18:12.609
That's what I'm saying.

18:14.211 --> 18:18.357
It's been badly handled by someone who's got torn here and there.

18:18.377 --> 18:19.478
There's lots of tearing.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.760
I'll get that old thing.

18:20.780 --> 18:21.821
It's 300 odd years, though.

18:21.841 --> 18:24.285
I mean, we've got that.

18:24.805 --> 18:25.707
That's exciting.

18:25.727 --> 18:27.890
Now, does this rank as one of your great finds?

18:28.330 --> 18:30.453
I would say it's a very interesting, good find.

18:31.274 --> 18:33.818
I'll show you a great find.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.214
Let me know when you want me to go, by the way.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.617
We don't get a chance to show our books.

18:40.697 --> 18:41.318
Show books to anybody.

18:41.358 --> 18:43.400
People don't have any knowledge or insight.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.621
People aren't interested.

18:44.641 --> 18:47.004
You can't imagine, also, they're not interested in books.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.969
Did you design this room with these?

18:51.289 --> 18:51.730
Yes.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.632
We drew on the wall.

18:53.652 --> 19:01.041
This is the reason I don't collect big things like that, prints and such.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.024
Before I show you this, I'll have to show you something else.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.942
What's the color of the paint?

19:07.962 --> 19:08.823
What do you call it?

19:09.584 --> 19:12.568
I just, I don't know, there were no colors.

19:13.970 --> 19:17.895
They have numbers at our paint store now.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.463
The brand is about a great color plate collection.

19:25.024 --> 19:27.948
We have these wondrous little fascicules.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.452
How could you pile with those wonderful color plates?

19:31.552 --> 19:33.775
We have to.

19:33.957 --> 19:36.200
There's a man called Jan Ladmiral.

19:36.261 --> 19:36.982
Very important.

19:37.022 --> 19:38.244
He worked with Goethe Daggett.

19:38.464 --> 19:39.586
L-A-D-E-M-I-R-E-A.

19:39.606 --> 19:41.288
And you should know that name for Dick Reich.

19:41.308 --> 19:42.530
But what I want to show you is that.

19:42.811 --> 19:43.031
Ooh.

19:43.412 --> 19:44.654
That is color mezzotint.

19:45.956 --> 19:46.917
All kinds of colors.

19:46.937 --> 19:47.939
Including the gold.

19:49.681 --> 19:50.503
That is gorgeous.

19:50.563 --> 19:54.308
It's like a jewel, isn't it?

19:54.328 --> 19:58.054
And there are in the world seven different of these pasticules.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.256
We have...

19:59.523 --> 20:03.910
You don't have... And in all the years we've been collecting... This is all we can find.

20:03.930 --> 20:08.817
This is the one that comes with... These are variants from other... What is the subject, might I ask?

20:08.837 --> 20:15.587
The subject has to do with the part of the brain, the dura... And so on.

20:15.607 --> 20:17.670
The reason I'm showing these to you... Now, remember this.

20:18.051 --> 20:22.498
Careful.

20:22.518 --> 20:25.823
Let's put them back in the box.

20:26.884 --> 20:28.787
This is a special edition.

20:29.105 --> 20:30.967
of a quite common book.

20:32.349 --> 20:38.435
There was a man called Van Mander, who was the Northern Vasari.

20:39.116 --> 20:44.542
He did the same for Dutch artists as Vasari did for us.

20:44.562 --> 20:51.310
And he hired this guy, Jan Laudmirao, to make portraits of these artists.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.772
And if you look down here, there it is.

20:53.973 --> 20:54.954
You'll see what it is.

20:54.994 --> 20:55.374
There it is.

20:55.494 --> 20:55.795
There it is.

20:55.895 --> 20:56.175
There it is.

20:56.408 --> 20:57.410
My god, that's it.

20:57.530 --> 20:59.955
It would otherwise be absolutely meaningless, right?

20:59.975 --> 21:00.336
That's it.

21:00.356 --> 21:01.779
It's one of the things that interests me.

21:01.799 --> 21:04.084
What this is then... How do you make these connections?

21:04.104 --> 21:05.146
How did you find them?

21:05.166 --> 21:08.533
Because we had this, and we had a shop in California.

21:08.553 --> 21:09.595
Hey, but you noticed it.

21:09.615 --> 21:10.958
We asked for portrait books.

21:11.495 --> 21:13.278
And he said, well, I have one.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.841
Yes, and he shows me this book.

21:15.121 --> 21:16.564
What happens when you see something like that?

21:16.584 --> 21:17.145
What do you feel?

21:17.165 --> 21:19.709
I feel very excited.

21:20.250 --> 21:25.840
And I saw this, and I see this is the final published one with the letters and the numbers, right?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.022
This is the proof.

21:27.443 --> 21:29.166
This is the engraver's drawing.

21:29.687 --> 21:31.169
And where's the artist's drawing?

21:31.189 --> 21:33.433
This is the artist's drawing.

21:33.453 --> 21:35.697
This is a lot of morale traced.

21:36.622 --> 21:38.203
Oh, copied, engraved.

21:38.424 --> 21:40.605
How do we spell this gentleman's name again?

21:40.626 --> 21:41.546
L. Adler.

21:41.626 --> 21:43.108
Okay, L. Adler, okay.

21:43.128 --> 21:44.549
And it goes like this.

21:44.609 --> 21:46.471
Is this a well-known work?

21:46.491 --> 21:46.551
No.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.372
Not this particular book, but I mean what he did.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.994
You said what he did.

21:50.014 --> 21:50.814
This.

21:50.975 --> 21:52.516
It's a very famous book.

21:52.596 --> 21:53.177
Sure, sir.

21:53.497 --> 21:53.957
Okay.

21:53.977 --> 21:54.858
It's very famous.

21:56.059 --> 21:59.662
But this is the sort of thing we were alert to because we were in the portrait business.

22:00.963 --> 22:02.965
The bookseller had no idea what he had.

22:02.985 --> 22:05.127
He didn't know any of the people.

22:05.512 --> 22:06.833
You knew von Maunder, of course.

22:06.853 --> 22:08.955
Yeah, you know, it felt like a $1,000 book.

22:08.975 --> 22:09.256
Yeah.

22:09.616 --> 22:10.857
And it literally was $1,000 book.

22:10.877 --> 22:12.639
It made $2,000 worth all of that.

22:13.340 --> 22:13.920
I know that.

22:15.662 --> 22:16.563
God, what's the title?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.965
What's right there on the spine?

22:18.985 --> 22:19.966
Carl von Maunder.

22:20.927 --> 22:23.410
Leven der Niederlandische Kunstler.

22:23.430 --> 22:25.472
Leven der Niederlandische Kunstler.

22:25.492 --> 22:26.152
E-N-D-E-R.

22:26.172 --> 22:26.873
Niederlandische.

22:26.893 --> 22:28.835
Le-N-D-S-C-H-E.

22:28.855 --> 22:29.395
Kunstler.

22:29.415 --> 22:29.596
Schilder.

22:29.696 --> 22:30.536
Schilder.

22:30.556 --> 22:30.837
Schilder.

22:30.857 --> 22:33.139
Did you say this is folio size?

22:33.271 --> 22:34.892
And probably even a little larger, right?

22:35.013 --> 22:35.513
Oh, yeah.

22:35.773 --> 22:37.855
Yeah.

22:37.875 --> 22:38.716
Well, that's a good book.

22:38.896 --> 22:39.416
That's great.

22:39.957 --> 22:42.179
Any great disappointments in the collecting?

22:42.859 --> 22:43.760
The ones that get away?

22:43.800 --> 22:49.765
Disappointment.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.667
Of course you're disappointed.

22:51.687 --> 22:54.649
Never what you thought that you would get.

22:54.669 --> 22:56.151
It's always what we've done.

22:56.171 --> 22:56.951
You don't have the money.

22:57.112 --> 23:00.074
Or else we didn't have the wits to know how good something was.

23:00.815 --> 23:01.395
How interesting.

23:01.415 --> 23:02.316
Did you taste the milk?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.321
I did, sir.

23:03.341 --> 23:03.661
Did you?

23:05.383 --> 23:13.050
Making the connections, though, with those color plates and seeing that... But you saw it instantly, didn't you?

23:13.371 --> 23:14.152
I saw it instantly.

23:14.172 --> 23:15.253
Well, then why should not?

23:15.273 --> 23:16.994
Richard set me up for it.

23:17.054 --> 23:19.197
Yeah, but I set myself up for it.

23:19.277 --> 23:20.938
I know those color plates.

23:21.078 --> 23:23.741
I know everything about color plates.

23:23.761 --> 23:24.482
It's so apparent.

23:24.982 --> 23:27.825
So then, therefore, do you know what that is?

23:27.845 --> 23:29.987
Have you gone back to the source?

23:30.007 --> 23:30.508
What source?

23:30.628 --> 23:32.590
To determine just what that famous little

23:33.312 --> 23:34.153
color plate is.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.255
Yeah, it's one of those.

23:36.377 --> 23:37.358
It's one of those, actually.

23:37.739 --> 23:39.081
I understand that.

23:39.121 --> 23:39.301
No.

23:39.862 --> 23:41.204
No, you mean what it is, medically?

23:41.224 --> 23:41.544
Yeah.

23:41.805 --> 23:44.909
It's just a little tract about a part of the brain.

23:46.812 --> 23:49.756
It must have been very famous in its time.

23:49.816 --> 23:51.018
It must have been well-known.

23:51.058 --> 23:55.565
Not famous, but they couldn't have been too many copies.

23:55.585 --> 23:59.070
Yeah, it was hard to print those letters, too.

23:59.090 --> 24:01.834
Let's see if we hear anything else.

24:02.438 --> 24:04.380
You've given me a great deal of your time.

24:04.420 --> 24:09.644
Have you found another collection like that?

24:09.664 --> 24:12.647
I don't expect to find an early collection like that.

24:12.687 --> 24:15.289
Well, Arthur and Charlotte have books better than ours.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.192
Early books better than ours.

24:18.232 --> 24:18.972
They have more money.

24:19.513 --> 24:20.274
More classics.

24:20.294 --> 24:24.677
And they also don't collect other objects.

24:24.938 --> 24:26.439
Well, they collect as a couple?

24:26.879 --> 24:27.260
Yeah.

24:27.620 --> 24:28.881
You don't collect as a couple.

24:29.341 --> 24:30.402
Yeah, we do.

24:31.864 --> 24:32.344
We do.

24:32.678 --> 24:33.319
And we don't.

24:34.300 --> 24:41.767
We did collect much, much more as a couple when we were just collecting the early books.

24:42.468 --> 24:46.812
When Lisa started collecting her women's books, it became much more her collecting.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.995
And I look upon this as her collection.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.597
I think this incredible achievement is hers.

24:52.278 --> 24:57.083
And I think it's Lisa Bassett's collection of the history of women.

24:58.328 --> 25:02.493
Whereas I look upon both of ours, although latterly it's been mostly mine.

25:02.593 --> 25:04.695
Well, latterly we also haven't been able to buy the books.

25:05.176 --> 25:06.197
But we do get books.

25:06.217 --> 25:06.477
Occasionally.

25:07.258 --> 25:09.140
I buy two or two to four books.

25:09.160 --> 25:09.500
A year.

25:11.002 --> 25:13.605
I'd like to cycle back to one other thing.

25:14.686 --> 25:18.390
Your collection probably does belong in an institution at some point.

25:18.791 --> 25:18.911
Yeah.

25:19.211 --> 25:25.298
When I said, on the other hand, you'd probably... Oh, I could say to go back now.

25:25.413 --> 25:27.656
Yeah, it's a priming collective.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.098
That's a philosophical statement.

25:29.218 --> 25:31.041
I wonder if you could just expand on that a little bit.

25:31.061 --> 25:37.891
I think what Lisa has done is put together diverse materials and made a new whole out of them.

25:37.911 --> 25:46.523
The femoral material, the journal material, the manuscript material, and the principles together create a new entity which has never existed before.

25:47.124 --> 25:53.513
And as a result, it instructs us, it informs us, it delights us, it educates us, and it transforms us.

25:53.965 --> 25:55.987
And it won't ever be put together in that way.

25:56.048 --> 25:59.732
Again, it can't be because materialists do a family.

25:59.752 --> 26:05.940
To break that up, it seems to me, would be to betray its essential quality.

26:07.201 --> 26:10.726
Whereas to break up the collection of old books, you're not breaking anything up.

26:10.846 --> 26:15.011
It's a nice collection of miscellaneous and early books.

26:15.031 --> 26:20.698
I can just see from the first sentence to that period, an entire statement

26:21.995 --> 26:28.725
I'll tell you, that was a great statement.

26:29.947 --> 26:36.517
Now, tell me just to... All right, now you've just explained Lisa's collection.

26:37.278 --> 26:45.050
Tell me why you think, on the other hand, your items, because I can't tell them all books because they're items.

26:46.492 --> 26:48.094
They also can't call them his.

26:48.154 --> 26:49.196
They're also not fine.

26:49.236 --> 26:49.977
They're ours.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.942
And I'd make that clear.

26:52.403 --> 26:57.229
The women's books are Lisa's, but everything else is ours.

26:57.249 --> 27:01.154
She participates in the rest, even though laterally she hasn't been beaten at all.

27:01.174 --> 27:04.198
What are you looking for, Lisa?

27:04.238 --> 27:05.700
You should see what's up.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.541
You can't believe this.

27:06.741 --> 27:08.584
Does this happen often to you?

27:08.664 --> 27:08.884
No.

27:09.144 --> 27:11.307
We had to do it for scholars.

27:11.624 --> 27:12.565
How about for yourselves?

27:12.765 --> 27:17.110
For ourselves, yeah, for also to revamp the collection, to let me get new stuff.

27:17.130 --> 27:21.716
I mean, I just, you know, I have no room, and I'm forever moving sections.

27:21.756 --> 27:25.400
We're building stacks in that new room, I think.

27:27.663 --> 27:32.368
But, tell me, you see, there is something I want to get out of the book.

27:32.408 --> 27:33.189
I understand.

27:33.429 --> 27:36.893
Bradley Martin, for instance, put together the greatest.

27:37.354 --> 27:38.355
Yeah, French.

27:38.515 --> 27:38.916
Yeah.

27:39.296 --> 27:40.197
The legend, and yet,

27:41.003 --> 27:42.925
I thought people would be outraged.

27:42.945 --> 27:43.626
No.

27:43.646 --> 27:43.926
Not really.

27:43.946 --> 27:47.530
They said, well, look, as a collection, it was wonderful, but Yale is a wonderful collection.

27:47.550 --> 27:50.593
Yeah, there are many other sets, but there aren't many like this.

27:50.673 --> 27:56.579
My book, Smith, Schlesinger, are the only places, not one or two.

27:56.699 --> 27:57.881
You mentioned Princeton.

27:57.941 --> 28:09.593
Princeton has a collection that was formed by a woman called Edith Holden, and she had early books, but she didn't have the kind of scope that I have.

28:09.961 --> 28:15.149
As I was saying to you before, I don't have only 19th Central American Suffrage.

28:15.590 --> 28:21.279
I also have a history of obstetrics and medicine.

28:21.579 --> 28:24.103
That's exciting, isn't it?

28:24.123 --> 28:24.664
Does this excite you?

28:24.684 --> 28:25.986
I have women printers.

28:26.086 --> 28:33.098
I mean, there was a woman called Anne Catherine Green, who was a colonial printer to Maryland.

28:33.538 --> 28:37.825
And it was Anne Catherine Green and Son on the title page, by the way.

28:38.632 --> 28:39.173
What?

28:39.193 --> 28:40.595
Of the Constitution?

28:40.775 --> 28:41.116
No, no, no.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.418
What did she print something them for?

28:42.438 --> 28:46.424
She would just say, print it to the Commons.

28:46.844 --> 28:52.513
But, so there are a lot of categories in what my books are.

28:52.533 --> 28:58.081
Do you have an idea, I don't know whether I asked you a question, how many items you have, roughly?

28:58.101 --> 28:58.422
No.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.126
It's irrelevant.

29:01.146 --> 29:01.947
Thousands say.

29:02.989 --> 29:04.030
Well, ten.

29:05.292 --> 29:07.896
I don't know, because, come sit over here for a second.

29:09.091 --> 29:12.074
Tens of thousands of items.

29:12.314 --> 29:16.779
Hundred-hundred children and not one comes to visit me.

29:17.399 --> 29:17.960
Do you know that?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.542
Two-thousand-year-old man?

29:20.122 --> 29:21.624
Oh, is that in the notebook?

29:21.644 --> 29:22.224
Yeah.

29:23.366 --> 29:33.216
These are blank books.

29:33.236 --> 29:36.499
And in them, I mean, the family is very hard to have.

29:37.036 --> 29:40.780
And these were, you know, these common little papers with handovers that were handed out.

29:41.601 --> 29:43.062
I mean, I survived.

29:43.082 --> 29:46.346
I had a napkin from a suffrage... Picnic.

29:47.287 --> 29:48.908
...that was printed.

29:48.928 --> 29:50.370
I mean, they were all... I collect things.

29:50.390 --> 29:54.835
I have so many stars that look to them, and I have a suffrage... That's very lack of a good condition.

29:54.855 --> 29:56.937
Yeah, that's... Is there any way to date that?

29:57.397 --> 30:00.621
Oh, sure, you can date it within a year by the time.

30:01.361 --> 30:02.423
Yeah, you can do it by the time.

30:02.483 --> 30:04.765
I could find out what year it was that this... Sure.

30:05.200 --> 30:16.032
This was just a flyer, Words to a Song, a March of Women, by J. Michael Smart.

30:16.072 --> 30:17.814
These are big blank paper.

30:17.834 --> 30:22.900
I imagine it's all... Tomorrow, sir, it's the one we're full of.

30:22.920 --> 30:23.220
An envelope.

30:26.244 --> 30:26.764
A little tiny.

30:26.844 --> 30:28.646
It's not a real song.

30:28.666 --> 30:29.968
It's just a book's room.

30:29.988 --> 30:33.672
That's in fabulous condition.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.686
Look at this stuff.

30:35.706 --> 30:37.047
You can't believe it, you see.

30:37.187 --> 30:38.749
Where are you going to duplicate this?

30:39.630 --> 30:39.750
Boxes.

30:39.770 --> 30:42.853
She has so much of this, you can't imagine how much she has.

30:42.953 --> 30:45.395
I have this guy running, I think, someplace.

30:45.415 --> 30:50.060
I don't know where he's going.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.122
He's going to be really hard.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.887
He's going to occasionally have a nasty, but not very often.

30:56.907 --> 30:57.848
Great suffrage demonstration.

30:57.868 --> 30:59.610
This piece is addressed to the medium.

30:59.630 --> 31:00.090
I think we see it.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.191
Social and political movement.

31:01.211 --> 31:02.933
Every proper goose should have been.

31:03.436 --> 31:08.885
Sorry, it's funny.

31:08.905 --> 31:10.087
It is funny.

31:13.873 --> 31:18.240
And Lisa has scrapbooks of... Suffer's scrapbooks.

31:18.260 --> 31:20.123
Suffer's scrapbooks.

31:20.203 --> 31:21.625
That's how it doesn't know.

31:21.645 --> 31:25.551
And these are from a collection of prints that we sold the prints.

31:25.571 --> 31:26.793
This is the Enlightened Smelly one?

31:27.735 --> 31:27.975
No.

31:28.259 --> 31:34.325
She was a remarkable woman.

31:34.345 --> 31:38.809
She was the only one who had been screwed with .

31:38.849 --> 31:40.551
She was his mistress.

31:40.591 --> 31:43.093
She traveled with the 8th Street Army and everything.

31:43.113 --> 31:49.199
She wrote a great book called Dorio Hearth.

31:49.419 --> 31:56.646
I mean, just by looking at it, it speaks.

31:57.841 --> 32:06.709
Now, age is obviously not the only factor.

32:06.909 --> 32:12.594
Now, this stuff you find in basements, you find in addictions.

32:12.614 --> 32:14.656
You've got to buy it at autographs, too.

32:14.936 --> 32:19.840
This is a Dr. Ward's gift.

32:19.880 --> 32:24.244
This is a gift.

32:24.324 --> 32:27.527
It was mounted on this, and I had it restored and taken off that.

32:29.718 --> 32:53.987
We're still running.

32:54.457 --> 32:55.078
Look at this.

32:55.338 --> 32:59.725
I mean, you just won't believe the amount and quality and quantity.

32:59.765 --> 33:04.513
Well, it's like a public institution, you see, this kind of collection.

33:04.533 --> 33:06.836
You're very proud of this collection.

33:06.856 --> 33:09.140
Oh, I think it's incredible.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.423
It's incredible.

33:13.787 --> 33:18.094
You have almost looked at it.

33:18.114 --> 33:18.895
I sense a...

33:19.212 --> 33:20.754
She's very proud of her.

33:20.774 --> 33:22.215
Great pride.

33:22.235 --> 33:28.062
Yeah, I've also given her some crucial books and objects for this collection, I mean, that I have found.

33:28.122 --> 33:36.691
In other words, that beautiful costume book that we first showed you, that came from me, that huge library book that came from me.

33:37.212 --> 33:39.634
So did many treasures, which I love finding.

33:39.675 --> 33:41.436
I've got wonderful books for Christmas.

33:41.517 --> 33:49.185
I have a feeling that one of the reasons that you really are very proud of it, it really seems to be an extension of her.

33:49.790 --> 33:52.653
Lisa seems to have conceived this.

33:52.673 --> 33:54.255
Yeah, totally.

33:54.275 --> 33:58.060
And I'm just proud, you know, I think it's a fantastic achievement.

33:58.080 --> 34:10.615
I mean, any collector who has any instinct... Oh, it's in the other box.

34:11.136 --> 34:15.421
But this is the letter that we've begun talking about.

34:16.462 --> 34:17.984
Who's that from?

34:18.765 --> 34:19.105
Oh, yeah.

34:19.355 --> 34:21.477
That's a great letter.

34:21.497 --> 34:21.998
Elizabeth Gaskell.

34:22.018 --> 34:22.859
I gave Lisa this letter.

34:23.139 --> 34:24.681
Lisa the President.

34:24.701 --> 34:30.347
Elizabeth Gaskell, a monk, and she was a great novelist, an enormous importance.

34:30.627 --> 34:37.274
But she also wrote probably one of the best biographies ever written in one of the famous biographies of Charlotte Bronte.

34:37.414 --> 34:40.137
And this letter is to Ellen Nussie.

34:40.978 --> 34:45.823
And Ellen Nussie was Charlotte Bronte's closest to all her friends.

34:45.843 --> 34:48.366
And this letter is written

34:49.257 --> 34:55.642
to Ellen Nussie by Elizabeth Gaskell, as she's really beginning her initial research on the biographies.

34:56.083 --> 35:03.990
And she is extremely obliged to you for kind answer to my almost illegible note.

35:05.091 --> 35:18.302
I wrote it with ink pen and ink at Skipton, where we were detained that Monday night after our visit to Howard.

35:21.978 --> 35:34.750
I am sure you can be of more service to me than anyone else, because you have been her dear friend for so many years, and must have known her through all the progress of her character.

35:34.811 --> 35:45.041
From what I can judge from the letters Mr. Nichols, father's husband, has entrusted me with, her very earliest way of expressing herself must have been different to common.

35:45.521 --> 35:51.647
And I look forward with deep personal interest.

35:52.049 --> 36:04.284
and for the value of any materials they may furnish me with, from my difficult and terribly interesting past, to the reading of any of these which you may think it right to entrust me with.

36:04.905 --> 36:06.066
I am sorry, Ms.

36:06.087 --> 36:06.367
Wooler, Ms.

36:06.387 --> 36:07.789
Wooler ran the school a short talk.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.051
I am sorry Ms.

36:10.071 --> 36:16.580
Wooler shrank from the idea of my coming to see you as Ilkley, which is, you know, as you thought of.

36:17.060 --> 36:20.925
As you say, it would have been better to talk about her on the hills,

36:21.209 --> 36:25.675
and in the free open air than in a room.

36:25.695 --> 36:28.680
It's wonderful, isn't it?

36:28.740 --> 36:33.286
For that letter to me, it's a very special mother-in-law.

36:33.306 --> 36:38.494
But this, this is a Charlotte Francaa letter.

36:40.817 --> 36:42.700
And it's wonderful because it's witty.

36:43.040 --> 36:43.921
And where did you get it?

36:44.222 --> 36:47.487
Manny gave it to me as a present.

36:47.687 --> 36:49.950
It came with it, I think.

36:50.605 --> 36:54.729
It's a very important letter.

36:55.830 --> 36:56.691
It's a wonderful letter.

36:56.731 --> 36:58.493
That's a $10,000 object.

36:58.653 --> 36:59.194
No, no.

36:59.394 --> 37:03.338
Roy said, when we were still living in England, it was a $12,000 letter.

37:04.239 --> 37:07.082
Roy Davids is the head of Sotheby's book.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.383
Sotheby's book.

37:08.403 --> 37:09.464
Good friend of ours.

37:09.564 --> 37:10.585
So it's a $15,000 object.

37:10.845 --> 37:11.506
So who knows?

37:12.387 --> 37:18.593
It's a great, great letter, because it's really, it's to Ellen, who's Ellen Murphy, my dear Ellie.

37:18.613 --> 37:19.414
Has he been published anywhere?

37:19.478 --> 37:21.860
It's been referred to.

37:21.900 --> 37:27.006
That makes them worth more, I guess, when they haven't been published.

37:27.026 --> 37:27.366
Yeah.

37:27.406 --> 37:31.090
But still, there's so few Charlotte letters.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.511
She's writing.

37:32.531 --> 37:35.835
It's very interesting about marriage.

37:36.115 --> 37:40.299
I couldn't afford to buy a letter like that today.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.141
I couldn't begin to.

37:42.161 --> 37:46.065
I bought that over, what, ten years ago or some more.

37:46.085 --> 37:47.106
But what is good is,

37:47.390 --> 37:50.234
You weren't tempted to sell it, either, because of the place.

37:50.254 --> 37:51.115
This is a wonderful letter.

37:51.135 --> 37:52.397
None of this stuff has ever been sold.

37:52.417 --> 37:53.338
I bought this at an auction.

37:53.658 --> 37:56.602
This is a letter of Lady Wilde, Oscar's mom.

37:56.802 --> 37:57.864
It's a lovely letter, too.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.906
And it's very, it has one lovely bit in it.

37:59.926 --> 38:01.428
Lady Speranza, her name is.

38:01.468 --> 38:03.151
She loves this collection.

38:03.171 --> 38:05.594
Oh, yeah.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.236
I like her very much, Speranza.

38:07.296 --> 38:08.497
She's a fantastic woman.

38:08.518 --> 38:10.881
She taught singing lessons.

38:10.901 --> 38:14.425
She gave singing lessons to keep the family going, and she would run and walk around.

38:14.545 --> 38:15.827
A woman's duty...

38:15.959 --> 38:17.982
Ends with marriage.

38:18.423 --> 38:22.328
She becomes a vegetable, a house leak, a mop.

38:22.348 --> 38:26.114
I feel that I am potted for the rest of my days.

38:26.154 --> 38:27.255
Who is this again?

38:27.275 --> 38:28.076
Wild's mother.

38:28.117 --> 38:29.118
Wild's mother.

38:29.659 --> 38:34.285
At marriage, at marriage, she becomes a vegetable, a house leak, a mop.

38:34.366 --> 38:35.387
A house leak, a mop.

38:35.407 --> 38:36.148
A mop.

38:36.168 --> 38:38.191
A leak, a vegetable, right?

38:38.211 --> 38:41.876
I feel that I am potted for the rest of my days.

38:42.617 --> 38:44.380
Isn't that incredible?

38:44.697 --> 38:45.778
What's the date on that?

38:45.798 --> 38:46.659
Is this date?

38:46.679 --> 38:46.979
1890s?

38:46.999 --> 38:47.920
No.

38:47.940 --> 38:48.761
1880s?

38:49.482 --> 38:49.542
No.

38:49.562 --> 38:52.044
I don't know if it was the date on that.

38:52.064 --> 38:52.304
1852.

38:52.344 --> 38:52.505
Yeah.

38:52.525 --> 38:53.185
1852, so.

38:54.607 --> 38:55.187
What did I say?

38:55.467 --> 38:57.289
71 pounds for that.

38:57.309 --> 38:58.150
That's not bad.

38:58.230 --> 39:00.893
This is one of the most moving things I want to understand.

39:01.013 --> 39:01.573
What's that?

39:02.574 --> 39:11.003
This is a group of things, three things, that this young woman, Emily Davison.

39:11.663 --> 39:11.983
Oh, yes.

39:12.044 --> 39:12.924
I'm going to go have it.

39:12.944 --> 39:13.265
Selfridges.

39:13.925 --> 39:14.586
That's what's fantastic.

39:15.072 --> 39:17.835
I'll show you some of the other books.

39:17.935 --> 39:23.542
These are all memorial things.

39:23.622 --> 39:34.335
Emily Davison, in order to... She threw herself under the king's horse at a race.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.856
I don't know if you know about this.

39:36.437 --> 39:39.301
And she became a real martyr to the cause.

39:39.321 --> 39:41.323
Is this stuff you know about afterwards?

39:41.343 --> 39:42.244
No, I knew about this.

39:42.460 --> 39:50.472
Yes, and I got a letter, and the letter is interesting.

39:50.532 --> 40:00.486
This is a handbook from Hasimo.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.910
There's a little anecdote after she died.

40:03.970 --> 40:30.287
She threw herself under the... Her name is Emily Wilding Davison, who graduated with honors at London University, took first-class honors in the final schools at Oxford University in English language and literature, suffered imprisonment and endured the torture of forcible feeding on many occasions, and finally at Epsom offered up her life for her faith on Wednesday, the 4th of June, 1913, and died on Sunday, the 8th of June, 1913.

40:33.507 --> 40:38.615
And it was said that the king inquired after the health of his horse.

40:39.497 --> 40:46.007
The queen inquired after the young man.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.149
And these were saved.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.332
It's interesting how these came.

40:49.573 --> 40:52.758
Now these, they would be categorized as ephemeral.

40:52.778 --> 40:53.459
This is definitely.

40:53.539 --> 40:56.464
Nothing is more ephemeral than this.

40:56.484 --> 40:56.764
Right?

40:57.004 --> 40:57.405
Here.

40:57.672 --> 41:06.704
In a loving memory of Miss Emily Wiley-Davidson, B.A., 38 years old, who was fatally injured on Epstein-Racebook, since then he was a started hospital in Epstein, interred at my house.

41:07.645 --> 41:08.406
This is a feminist.

41:09.127 --> 41:11.951
And this is a transcript of this letter.

41:13.092 --> 41:13.893
Dear Stahl.

41:14.173 --> 41:17.338
Dear Stahl, here are three of the cards I did not see any more about.

41:17.538 --> 41:20.722
Even these have had adventures.

41:20.742 --> 41:24.026
They were last retrieved from the insides of a royal pillbox.

41:24.046 --> 41:26.970
I was lunching with Evelyn Eng and Princess Alice of Tess.

41:27.389 --> 41:29.873
And after lunch, the toilet started, right?

41:29.893 --> 41:34.700
And after lunch, I said I was to rummage in the crowd for Memorial Day.

41:35.902 --> 41:39.006
So the princess immediately said she would like to come and see the fun.

41:39.807 --> 41:45.095
There was a great crowd about and insisted on squeezing in, vodkin between, in the groan.

41:45.115 --> 41:54.189
Of course, with all the well-known livery we got through everywhere and bought these things, they were paid for by Weigel, the Egyptologist, as I found myself without my purse in the street.

41:54.830 --> 41:57.193
And W, happening to be just there, paid for them.

41:57.747 --> 42:03.954
Then the princess was afraid that they would take us to suffragettes, and the unfortunate cars were stuffed away and finally forgotten.

42:03.974 --> 42:06.837
It was only by telephoning to the stables later they were retrieved.

42:07.638 --> 42:10.921
It was an enormously long procession, but everything was very orderly.

42:11.382 --> 42:12.323
The police were wonderful.

42:12.343 --> 42:14.004
The traffic wasn't stopped exactly.

42:14.024 --> 42:15.886
They managed to pass the show down the middle of it.

42:16.367 --> 42:23.815
I might be able to come to that Friday 27th to try to draw a little Dora, or if not, I could spare a longer time at the beginning of it.

42:23.915 --> 42:25.096
I don't know who was home.

42:25.136 --> 42:26.758
Much love from Dora.

42:27.464 --> 42:28.465
But that's a family.

42:28.485 --> 42:30.067
Now you got this as a group of others.

42:30.208 --> 42:36.876
Yes, these were the three things that she retrieved from the parents.

42:36.896 --> 42:37.938
This is all over.

42:37.958 --> 42:39.440
Preserving a fragment, you know, too.

42:39.460 --> 42:39.700
Oh, yeah.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.261
And how?

42:41.322 --> 42:44.587
An important fragment that would otherwise be lost.

42:44.747 --> 42:47.210
These are two notes that have lots of notes.

42:47.230 --> 42:51.375
That's why I meant the thing together creates a new total.

42:51.395 --> 42:52.597
It's a synergy, actually.

42:52.617 --> 42:53.318
That's right.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.079
These are notes.

42:54.869 --> 42:57.993
by a former woman called Emily Faithful.

43:00.797 --> 43:04.622
Who ran a... The Victoria Press, including formative women.

43:04.642 --> 43:08.386
Including compositors and press women and everything.

43:11.010 --> 43:17.799
She had an annuity... And she influenced... She visited America three times and wrote a crucially interesting book about her trip to America.

43:18.399 --> 43:20.522
She visited the Riverside Press in Boston.

43:20.924 --> 43:22.106
saw all the women working.

43:22.126 --> 43:26.672
He said, ah, look at how the Victorian press is influenced in the spread of women in printing work.

43:26.693 --> 43:40.453
Mr. Beatrice, will you help my last effort in America by using the enclosed, if possible, and by giving out a notice of my lecture at your Sunday services?

43:40.533 --> 43:45.020
I hope to be surrounded by some of your noblest countrymen and women.

43:48.004 --> 43:50.087
That good old Derek Smith has come

43:50.303 --> 43:56.049
up on purpose from Peterborough, Lucretia Mott expects to be present.

43:56.069 --> 44:02.396
And I shall bid farewell to this land of promise with genuine... Sorry.

44:02.577 --> 44:04.739
No, genuine something in spite of asthma.

44:05.480 --> 44:09.865
The proceeds of the lecture I shall devote to my fund for destitute gentlewomen.

44:10.445 --> 44:11.286
This is Emily?

44:11.306 --> 44:12.668
This is Emily Faithful.

44:12.688 --> 44:14.049
And then here's the notice of the lecture.

44:14.110 --> 44:14.170
Ms.

44:14.190 --> 44:17.273
Faithful will give a farewell address on work for women

44:17.692 --> 44:27.383
With her English and American experiences at Steinway Hall, Thursday afternoon, April 3rd, the proceeds will be given to Miss Faithful's Home Fund for Distressed Ladies.

44:27.463 --> 44:31.167
Lucretia Mott is expected to address the meeting.

44:31.187 --> 44:34.110
We named our daughter after Lucretia Mott.

44:34.130 --> 44:36.533
49 Remington Street.

44:36.553 --> 44:36.633
Yes.

44:36.653 --> 44:37.654
Another one was faithful.

44:37.674 --> 44:38.915
She's enormously interesting.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.477
There's a huge bibliography.

44:40.497 --> 44:41.198
It's just typed.

44:41.238 --> 44:43.200
Nobody's done any work on her, really.

44:44.802 --> 44:45.943
This is really an archive.

44:46.413 --> 44:54.843
This is the Julie Ward Howe letter, which I find very amusing and very interesting, because I believe she was 92 or so when she wrote this letter.

44:56.145 --> 44:58.848
Showing the letter how it looks of a 92-year-old woman.

45:06.838 --> 45:10.362
It's interesting because she's a little anxious to speak, and she's a little anxious.

45:11.843 --> 45:13.825
This surely must be my last public appearance.

45:13.905 --> 45:19.873
I'm quite sure of a gratifying reception from my native city, but not so sure of a favorable verdict.

45:20.013 --> 45:25.219
Wasn't it strange that I should fear to show you my work, and yet dare to recite them for the great public.

45:25.239 --> 45:26.981
I've read your two, and it's interesting.

45:27.001 --> 45:28.403
Who is she writing to?

45:28.423 --> 45:28.923
Sanborn.

45:29.484 --> 45:30.345
Magistrates.

45:30.365 --> 45:32.548
Sanborn.

45:32.568 --> 45:39.676
I've got the first Uncle Tom's cabin, which I found in wonderful condition.

45:39.696 --> 45:40.097
Really?

45:40.817 --> 45:41.378
Found in Cape.

45:41.695 --> 45:43.277
A little old guy by the name of that.

45:44.338 --> 45:47.282
Look, he's dead now.

45:47.322 --> 45:48.323
Winston Burrell.

45:48.524 --> 45:49.705
Do you want to press Winston?

45:50.046 --> 45:51.828
No.

45:51.848 --> 45:52.349
Burrell?

45:52.609 --> 45:53.270
Burrell.

45:53.410 --> 45:54.531
B-U-R-R-E-R.

45:55.993 --> 45:56.874
Margaret Fuller.

45:56.914 --> 45:58.016
That's a lot of money for that.

45:58.036 --> 45:58.757
It's been wonderful.

45:58.797 --> 46:01.520
I think it came out of the house in the case.

46:01.540 --> 46:02.962
Do you have any style material?

46:03.042 --> 46:04.805
I have printed books.

46:05.526 --> 46:06.146
I have a letter.

46:06.206 --> 46:06.707
There's one letter.

46:07.261 --> 46:08.482
Alice Moore's Pearl.

46:08.502 --> 46:10.965
Pearl of the other books are worthless, basically.

46:11.085 --> 46:11.805
No, they're not.

46:12.506 --> 46:15.109
Pearl of Horse Island, I disagree with you.

46:15.149 --> 46:17.611
There's a book called Literary Women by Ellen Mullins.

46:17.631 --> 46:18.972
Okay, that was a foolish statement.

46:19.132 --> 46:20.274
Yeah, the books aren't worthless.

46:20.294 --> 46:25.459
I mean, they might not have had the importance that Uncle Tom's cabin had.

46:25.559 --> 46:29.202
I think maybe the word, the expression... Let me show them some printed books.

46:29.222 --> 46:31.404
This is some early material, all right?

46:31.504 --> 46:33.106
What do you want to say?

46:33.166 --> 46:36.009
I feel like I'd show them the first coined book.

46:36.029 --> 46:36.289
Yeah.

46:37.163 --> 47:05.263
i would have just make sure i've got another tape ready it's time to have another cape up already

47:07.775 --> 47:12.322
This is a marvelous book.

47:12.342 --> 47:13.724
I'll just show you some random things.

47:13.784 --> 47:14.465
I love it.

47:14.485 --> 47:14.826
All right?

47:15.607 --> 47:26.644
This is the very first book ever made, which tries to set forth in some order and system the earliest Roman poem.

47:27.545 --> 47:30.590
It's called Illustrious, Illustrium Imogenesis.

47:30.630 --> 47:35.537
It's by a man called Poulvius, and it was printed in 1517.

47:37.323 --> 47:40.588
in Rome by a guy called Iacobo Mazzocchius.

47:41.730 --> 47:45.375
Impressed in Rome, I'll put Iacobo Mazzocchius of Rome.

47:45.395 --> 47:45.596
Nice.

47:45.876 --> 47:49.622
He also was a bookseller, 1517, the 15th day of the year.

47:49.642 --> 47:53.728
I think Mazzocchius is a... That's pretty clever for 1517, that little... No.

47:55.130 --> 47:55.671
What, this?

47:56.011 --> 48:01.420
Well, I mean, this little inverted... They did that... That's where it came from.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.484
And by 1523, there was a French copy of the book.

48:04.725 --> 48:06.267
See, illustrium imaginae.

48:07.816 --> 48:09.619
Do you have any incunables here?

48:09.659 --> 48:10.760
No, but this could.

48:10.780 --> 48:13.444
If I told you that's an incunable, it looks just like it.

48:13.464 --> 48:14.846
It feels like it, doesn't it?

48:14.866 --> 48:21.656
It's an exact copy of this book, down to misunderstanding the... Just a little smaller format.

48:21.676 --> 48:23.299
Smaller format.

48:23.519 --> 48:24.721
So how did they replicate it?

48:25.301 --> 48:26.103
Well, they tried.

48:26.123 --> 48:27.665
They just copied it, you see.

48:27.685 --> 48:28.747
They copied all these ornaments.

48:28.827 --> 48:29.688
They're all copied.

48:30.088 --> 48:31.951
I could find the very, you know, object.

48:31.971 --> 48:33.814
The decorations.

48:33.874 --> 48:36.658
They don't have the verb because they don't understand it, right?

48:36.773 --> 48:41.639
I think it's 1523 or thereabouts.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.603
Now, you wouldn't call this a piracy.

48:46.064 --> 48:48.647
Of course there is an absolute dead piracy.

48:51.810 --> 48:53.012
MD 1524.

48:53.352 --> 48:55.054
I mean, do we have piracies in those days?

48:55.114 --> 48:55.474
Of course.

48:55.515 --> 48:56.716
This is a piracy, isn't it?

48:56.736 --> 48:57.537
It just lifted it.

48:57.857 --> 49:01.161
But, I mean, there were no copyright laws, of course not.

49:01.276 --> 49:02.518
Oh, that's not for Germany.

49:02.538 --> 49:04.901
Well, I wanted to show you what they did in Germany then.

49:04.921 --> 49:06.163
Now, did you find these separately?

49:06.263 --> 49:06.644
Yes.

49:07.585 --> 49:10.990
That's the fun of it, isn't it, huh?

49:11.090 --> 49:17.780
And then in Germany, the next year, in 1525, appears Mr. Ulrich.

49:18.561 --> 49:21.566
This book, which is a... This is 1534.

49:21.586 --> 49:22.387
It's a later edition.

49:22.407 --> 49:23.268
I'll show you why.

49:23.729 --> 49:25.051
But this is the same book.

49:25.231 --> 49:25.832
Oh, that's beautiful.

49:26.072 --> 49:28.015
But this is really a gorgeous book.

49:28.035 --> 49:28.516
God, look at that.

49:28.536 --> 49:29.157
Top thing of that.

49:29.407 --> 49:30.969
Do you see it's the same thing?

49:31.029 --> 49:32.430
Why is the paper so good?

49:32.651 --> 49:34.152
It says pure paper.

49:34.633 --> 49:35.073
Pure red.

49:35.314 --> 49:37.496
Starts with Julius Caesar.

49:37.516 --> 49:37.756
Where is he?

49:37.776 --> 49:38.337
There is.

49:38.617 --> 49:42.602
That's Alexander Magnus.

49:42.942 --> 49:44.204
Julius Caesar.

49:45.365 --> 49:46.346
Julius Caesar.

49:47.327 --> 49:48.048
Where is he?

49:48.068 --> 49:48.328
Where is he?

49:48.348 --> 49:49.510
That's all.

49:49.530 --> 49:50.591
Pompeius.

49:50.611 --> 49:52.393
Marcellus.

49:52.413 --> 49:55.676
Oh, I'm missing the name.

49:55.696 --> 49:56.878
Julia, where are you?

49:56.898 --> 49:58.119
Well, that's what's the point.

49:58.319 --> 49:58.840
Anyhow.

49:59.140 --> 50:00.422
This is a gorgeous book.

50:01.363 --> 50:04.888
But it's based on these two books, but slightly different, you see.

50:05.349 --> 50:06.511
And we know who made these.

50:07.031 --> 50:09.395
We know who made these, too, by the way.

50:09.475 --> 50:12.559
A man called Hans Weintert is responsible.

50:12.599 --> 50:17.266
It's actually visually very beautiful books of the Renaissance, I think.

50:17.286 --> 50:17.847
This book?

50:17.867 --> 50:18.328
This book.

50:18.728 --> 50:19.610
Don't you think it's gorgeous?

50:20.611 --> 50:22.273
But I mean, you just made quite a statement.

50:22.294 --> 50:23.215
One of the most beautiful books.

50:23.335 --> 50:23.816
Oh, look at it.

50:23.876 --> 50:25.418
I think it's a magnificent book.

50:26.326 --> 50:27.868
I'm not challenging you on it.

50:27.888 --> 50:36.462
And then if you don't think that's beautiful, in the back of it, there's a second book, which is Consularum Romanorum.

50:36.482 --> 50:40.668
These are the coins of the Roman consuls away from Rome.

50:41.389 --> 50:45.055
And it just has then a catalogue with these wonderful borders.

50:45.716 --> 50:49.161
And then when you get to the coins, they're just like this.

50:49.582 --> 50:50.423
Look at this opening.

50:51.184 --> 50:52.586
It's gorgeous, eh?

50:52.606 --> 50:55.050
It's fabulous.

50:55.756 --> 51:01.528
I just want to show them one more of the... You don't treat your books gingerly, though, do you?

51:01.688 --> 51:02.269
Oh, be careful.

51:02.530 --> 51:05.195
It just looks like... I just want to show them this.

51:05.275 --> 51:07.360
I would be frightened to have a book like that.

51:07.380 --> 51:09.584
Well, if you're frightened... I know.

51:10.326 --> 51:15.857
And I'll show you one last coin book, which is a precious book.

51:17.018 --> 51:21.102
which may have been illustrated by the guy who... Do you get these because you like clothes?

51:21.182 --> 51:23.244
No, because it's just immensely interesting.

51:23.284 --> 51:26.186
Actually, Philip Hopper gave me this as a present.

51:26.206 --> 51:27.067
This is as external.

51:27.087 --> 51:29.129
That's our old house in Northampton.

51:29.149 --> 51:30.210
That was our English.

51:30.230 --> 51:31.451
I haven't put our new one in.

51:33.453 --> 51:34.874
You cleaned up here.

51:34.894 --> 51:36.395
Here it is.

51:36.415 --> 51:37.636
It goes right down here.

51:39.058 --> 51:39.918
Or down there.

51:39.939 --> 51:40.359
I don't know.

51:40.439 --> 51:40.919
It doesn't matter.

51:40.939 --> 51:44.443
Well, anyhow, Philip Hopper, you know what I mean?

51:44.463 --> 51:44.983
Do you agree?

51:45.419 --> 51:47.822
But we already had a copy of the book that he gave me.

51:48.583 --> 51:53.749
I didn't tell him, though.

51:53.769 --> 52:02.580
But it is those coins again, but so beautiful, like gems, the way they're cut white on black.

52:03.602 --> 52:06.846
You see how gorgeous that is?

52:06.866 --> 52:08.247
Well, I could go on and on.

52:08.348 --> 52:09.329
Is that a vellum?

52:09.549 --> 52:10.250
That's vellum.

52:10.310 --> 52:11.652
That's vellum, that's vellum.

52:12.873 --> 52:13.494
What did you say?

52:13.554 --> 52:14.215
Yes, I'm on.

52:14.235 --> 52:15.036
Yes, I'm on.

52:15.056 --> 52:15.156
Okay.

52:16.942 --> 52:18.024
So that's pointless.

52:18.124 --> 52:18.384
Wow.

52:21.028 --> 52:25.134
They are interesting because they're the earliest form of portrait books.

52:28.078 --> 52:33.025
Would you say that's kind of your major direction personally right now is portrait books?

52:33.045 --> 52:34.006
At the moment, yes.

52:34.647 --> 52:36.830
It's because they're eminently collectible.

52:37.391 --> 52:38.653
So it's opportunity as well.

52:38.753 --> 52:46.003
So we love a kind of book called model book.

52:48.110 --> 52:49.884
That book.

52:49.904 --> 52:51.818
This is a more classic bottle book.

52:52.161 --> 52:53.108
Ruben Sand.
