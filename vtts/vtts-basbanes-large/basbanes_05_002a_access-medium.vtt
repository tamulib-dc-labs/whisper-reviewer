00:37.122 --> 01:04.007
Part of this comes from

01:04.342 --> 01:19.658
that great feeling of warmth, devotional, and hospitality, that sense that if we're coming to Worcester for the first time, we are returning to a place we hold up.

01:19.678 --> 01:33.792
I think part of that comes from finding here again old friends, like Father Dean, because he doesn't sit here, who will engage with Demetri Pastino's daughter.

01:34.210 --> 01:41.425
and new friends that I know will become over a period of time.

01:41.445 --> 01:45.934
Friends, I have this world.

01:45.954 --> 01:54.953
In a thrilled way, this is the feeling we have as I move across this country through the name of their issues.

01:55.608 --> 02:01.700
That sense of caring, of meaning, of one place to come.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.666
What do you say you are a noted writer?

02:04.686 --> 02:06.570
Is it not always this way?

02:06.871 --> 02:16.570
Do you not enter a town, an earthly town, meet before a club, seated, acclaimed, recognized?

02:17.528 --> 02:27.099
There are times when the enthusiasm of a person in which you meet exceeds their literary accuracy.

02:27.119 --> 02:41.135
As with a woman, program chairman of a woman club in Minnesota, with zeal as Patrice, the world were not the author of Portland.

02:43.438 --> 02:46.962
That was obviously not the part, but an eminently free

02:46.942 --> 02:52.749
But no, it isn't always that way.

02:52.849 --> 03:09.388
I remember through the years of lecturing a whole series of tall college towns coming in late and inviting you to a dreary bus terminal or railroad station being picked up by an associate instructor in the English department.

03:09.757 --> 03:19.749
Driven to the only hotel in town, a grim, forbidding-looking character that resembled the story by Edgar Allan Poe.

03:19.789 --> 03:28.479
Taking into the lobby, which has the musty smell of our food, withered palms beside the registration desk.

03:29.601 --> 03:34.887
Out to my room, where, if it is winter, steam kisses in the rusted rain.

03:37.330 --> 03:44.966
I would sleep that night in the bed of a mattress that I would sleep.

03:48.573 --> 03:50.277
That reasonable reason.

03:50.678 --> 04:00.935
In the morning would rise to shade before a band of ear that was always trapped in my face to meet the contortions of the glass.

04:01.556 --> 04:10.611
The different aspects of my nature made my thoughts.

04:10.726 --> 04:27.604
The noun of the pleasantest part of the day was assembly or the convocation, the chance to meet with students, afterwards before departure for the next student at the college town, lunch with selected members of the English department.

04:28.175 --> 04:38.565
Most of whom were amiable and friendly, and the few who were hostile because they had written novels, they thought were better than anything I had done.

04:38.826 --> 04:42.209
But they could not get the publication.

04:45.132 --> 04:52.159
I am, with all the grand introductions of this literary, a story.

04:52.179 --> 04:55.482
It is an old and terribly honorable tradition.

04:56.322 --> 05:09.856
We used to have, in a way, a claim to make all the story-telling, an old blind quote by the people who told some good stories.

05:09.876 --> 05:16.863
I remember the great flapping of arms before the ramparts of Troy that morning.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.565
I remember the old memories that are armed.

05:18.945 --> 05:21.388
Now, how does the story-teller begin?

05:21.408 --> 05:23.410
It does not begin much differently than all of us.

05:24.250 --> 05:50.258
We also learn that the activities of the memories are less important than the emotion which the memories generate.

05:51.014 --> 06:11.014
The fine novelist Wright Morris had a memory of gathering with a group of his friends under the back porch of a house where he grew up.

06:11.737 --> 06:22.229
Years later, as a result, he returned to that house and was astounding to find there wasn't room under the back porch for anything more than an assembly of cats.

06:22.970 --> 06:30.498
How could he remember, he thought so clearly, those friends gathered under that porch?

06:30.518 --> 06:36.625
I suspect that what he remembered was the warmth, the emotion of that gathering.

06:36.645 --> 06:40.630
And that replaced the accuracy of the

06:43.681 --> 06:46.447
My father was a Greek Orthodox.

06:48.210 --> 06:51.938
We grew up on the south side of Shippon.

06:51.958 --> 07:00.155
We lived, 10 of us, in our family, in buildings always in general proximity to my father's church.

07:00.215 --> 07:03.742
Some of you raised in an environment like that.

07:03.902 --> 07:04.744
You'll remember that.

07:05.213 --> 07:18.874
were two-story or three-story buildings, very narrow, separated by very narrow gang waves where the earth was dead and dark because it never felt the light or warmth of the sun.

07:18.894 --> 07:30.913
The buildings were all the same, designed by the same brooding architects, whose evolved aim was to eliminate as much light and warmth from these rooms as possible.

07:30.953 --> 07:33.837
It was a sunflower room in front

07:34.610 --> 07:42.198
Living room, long narrow corridor from which bedrooms and bathrooms ran off like cubicles in the ladder of the devils.

07:43.018 --> 07:52.568
Dining room, kitchen, back of the kitchen, a small sun-parter room, where the windows never had to look any close, so the room was frigid winter.

07:53.529 --> 07:56.231
How did I know that room was frigid winter?

07:56.251 --> 08:01.917
I was one of the youngest in the family, and invariably those rooms were my domain.

08:02.993 --> 08:05.437
I can remember waking on a winter morning.

08:06.678 --> 08:13.649
You know how one tests the temperature of the air by exhaling before you emerge from beneath the cupboards?

08:13.669 --> 08:24.525
I would breathe out into the cold air of the room, and if I asked you what I see, you would answer, I saw my breath.

08:24.545 --> 08:28.090
Though this is an important part of all I will have to tell you.

08:29.133 --> 08:35.984
A storyteller must not accept any experience as ordinary.

08:36.004 --> 08:40.832
All experience is extraordinary because it is happening to us.

08:41.573 --> 08:47.563
It is happening to that life within us, to that span of years within us.

08:48.364 --> 08:55.596
There is no such thing as ordinary experience because each of us, in our own way, is extraordinary.

08:56.605 --> 09:00.515
Therefore I would respond, I did not see my breath.

09:01.157 --> 09:08.978
I saw the sphere of my breath congeal at once into a ball of ice and plummet to the floor.

09:09.970 --> 09:14.199
But this room was a delight in spring, summer, and autumn.

09:14.219 --> 09:18.688
I could open the windows, could call to my friends playing in the alley below.

09:18.788 --> 09:19.891
They would call out to me.

09:19.971 --> 09:27.506
I would go down and join them at their games, which must be the games you played as children and grandchildren play now.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.491
It was high school.

09:29.511 --> 09:30.713
Pick the can.

09:30.963 --> 09:33.186
You must all remember, kick the can.

09:33.606 --> 09:39.613
The goalkeeper tending the can, the idea to call out the name of any player here.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.796
Tap the can, the player comes to jail.

09:42.456 --> 09:52.128
Now as long as even one player remains free, who might get to that can and kick it, then all those already captured would go free.

09:52.148 --> 09:56.633
So the more players captured in a game, the more nervous the goalkeeper becomes.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.972
I remember one magnificent game of kick the can.

10:01.453 --> 10:07.764
Nineteen of my freemates captured, I the only one still free.

10:07.924 --> 10:09.447
How did I know I was the only one still free?

10:10.028 --> 10:16.558
I could hear their beseeching voices calling to me across the backyard fences.

10:16.578 --> 10:18.942
Harry, save us!

10:18.962 --> 10:20.545
Save us!

10:21.233 --> 10:33.292
I crept stealthily from yard to yard, hid for a moment behind a garbage can, shitting up a telephone pole to stand for a moment on the peak of a garage roof.

10:33.312 --> 10:37.478
There they were, masked in the alley before me, the goldkeeper and his prisoners.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.107
I stood up for a moment, balanced precariously like a Greek Superman.

10:43.508 --> 10:53.906
and then leaped down into their starved mist to give the can a smashing, furious kick that sent it ricocheting and rolling down the alley.

10:53.926 --> 10:58.815
I, teed of my claiming, cried out my name in jubilation.

11:02.501 --> 11:03.964
The goalkeeper.

11:03.944 --> 11:15.643
A good friend of mine who told that day was in such despair he sat down on the stole of the alley and cried.

11:15.663 --> 11:23.617
You will say, please, it was, after all, simply the game that kicked the camera.

11:23.637 --> 11:27.403
But I say to you, it was not the game that kicked the camera.

11:28.480 --> 11:38.092
It was a moment of gilded and golden triumph I had been trying vainly in my life to match.

11:38.112 --> 11:47.304
The twilight and the plaintive voices of the mothers falling across the gathering darkness.

11:48.185 --> 11:56.395
Now we would scatter German, Polish, Irish, Jewish, Greek, going up to our own ethnic preserves,

11:57.775 --> 12:03.048
Looking back, my mother's kitchen always warmed for me.

12:03.088 --> 12:05.253
The sense of freshly baked bread.

12:05.273 --> 12:06.537
Was she always baking?

12:06.597 --> 12:08.722
No, she probably didn't bake more than once a month.

12:09.624 --> 12:13.253
But we remember not that which happened.

12:15.545 --> 12:17.970
I remember my mother's kitchen.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.875
Warm, pretty big bread.

12:21.336 --> 12:25.144
We'd have a slice of that bread with a little glass of red wine before going to bed.

12:25.184 --> 12:28.089
Sometimes as a special treat, the great soup bowl.

12:28.590 --> 12:32.558
When it had been boiled for broth, we'd scoop out the marrow.

12:34.192 --> 12:42.000
When I say to a high school or a palet audience, narrow sandwiches, I would read it with a collective.

12:43.642 --> 12:46.705
And I say to them, they are deprived.

12:50.589 --> 12:54.874
Sunday morning, my father would wake me very early.

12:54.894 --> 12:57.837
I would go with him to his church.

12:58.643 --> 13:04.241
I remember the stillness of those mornings the two of us walking down 61st Street.

13:05.084 --> 13:09.278
The first light of dawn flimmering across the top.

13:09.832 --> 13:17.021
The Earth is suspended in that curious moment that we have in our grasp at the beginning of time.

13:17.041 --> 13:23.369
That moment when the night begins to descend and the light can move stronger.

13:24.070 --> 13:32.200
That moment that is precarious and dangerous because there is always that perhaps the darkness will remain strong.

13:33.241 --> 13:35.704
The light will not gain a sense anymore.

13:35.971 --> 13:40.998
I remember the stillness and our footsteps across the walls.

13:41.018 --> 13:58.522
And I remember one particular morning now, more than forty-five years ago, when the only other occupant of the street beside my father and myself was a prowling town, turning to the point of the street, and I drowned.

13:58.582 --> 14:05.472
Like I heard to this day, my father decided to excuse me that I had to say, I will expect exactly

14:05.654 --> 14:34.480
As a brief reading, I'm going to read to you a memory of that period, a recollection I have of my childhood, and of the way in which I wrote it in here, and the way in which the writer introduces the element of nostalgia to warm and enjoy it.

14:37.565 --> 14:47.546
If one traveled west from our neighborhood across Cottage Grove Avenue to the location of my father's church, the district was almost completely blocked.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.971
Cottage Grove seen the dividing line.

14:50.120 --> 15:02.820
It took us to the military school who taught English subjects from 9 to 1230, and after a break for lunch, it means grammar and history from 1 to 12.

15:02.840 --> 15:10.812
Our teachers are both Greek and American, and achieve the common ethnic denominator by their reliance upon the stick.

15:11.365 --> 15:14.972
I would get flat hands without someone getting walloped.

15:14.992 --> 15:21.005
As a rule, the American teachers were struck without any great position.

15:21.025 --> 15:27.197
One of the Greek teachers of the group of their Mediterranean background struck with passion and fur.

15:27.532 --> 15:32.383
We had boys in our class who were continually practicing with the hold of the punishment.

15:32.924 --> 15:42.646
There was once a classmate of mine who had threatened with a beating would sprint to a rear window, open it, and leap through a second before the outreach teacher reached him.

15:43.769 --> 15:46.114
He was called a racist.

15:46.550 --> 15:50.819
We had another boy called Trappier Cleveland the Howl.

15:51.360 --> 15:58.614
At the first blow, whoever he liked, he would begin to howl and shriek in unremitting agony, rolling his eyes, clutching his head.

15:59.396 --> 16:02.382
There was still another boy called the Duck.

16:04.049 --> 16:11.778
As supple of the snake, he would twist and coil his body, neatly evading most of the violent flailings of the stick.

16:11.918 --> 16:21.970
We watched the spouse with rapid admiration till the exhaustion came from, having pickled the land more than two or three bones out of thirst.

16:22.250 --> 16:28.718
I own experience with the stick included a period when, for some reason, I was never struck with.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.221
You never get hit, but there's a problem.

16:31.522 --> 16:35.070
My classmates told me resentment.

16:35.130 --> 16:41.745
However, there was another interminable period when I suffered the curse for the most trivial in life.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.489
I was beaten every day.

16:43.823 --> 16:48.391
You always get hit because your father's the priest, they explain it.

16:48.411 --> 16:52.238
I brought the priest to my church and school.

16:52.258 --> 17:09.207
It was a Roman Catholic church and parish school, a foreign country ruled by long, black-skirted, white-sized sisters, with the awesome capability to deliver bare-handed blows that equal the force of the ones struck by our teachers with sticks.

17:09.187 --> 17:19.291
I once witnessed a boy pulled out of line by an irate sister who held him by the scrum in his jacket and then delivered a short beard and bow to his side.

17:19.311 --> 17:27.550
He landed crumbled against the fence, apparently outpulled in the knockout Muhammad Ali with a bad hand.

17:27.530 --> 17:31.614
Reflecting the neighborhood, most of the students in the Catholic school were black.

17:32.175 --> 17:35.878
We came as interlopers from the white neighborhood across Cottage Grove.

17:36.159 --> 17:40.163
Black and white, we were mortal enemies constantly at war.

17:40.803 --> 17:48.291
Our assaults and forays against one another raged in curses and stone-throwing to full-scale battles with fists and sticks.

17:48.991 --> 17:55.798
I cannot remember anyone getting killed, which was a wonder considering the number of broken teeth and bloody heads.

17:56.318 --> 18:00.465
After such encounters, our teachers pulled us inside and beat us.

18:00.825 --> 18:09.139
Much as the black boys were being beaten across the street, the punishment, as you can imagine, served only to intensify our fury.

18:09.159 --> 18:22.461
There was a black boy I will never forget, tall and strong, although he was no more than fourteen, with the speed and body of a superb athlete who spread care among us.

18:22.913 --> 18:30.683
Sighted, splashing eyes and grayed white teeth, bared in a scream of battle, struck us with panic.

18:30.703 --> 18:45.601
One ignominious day, the infertile defense entered our playground, and a hundred of us, boys and girls caught in some mob hysteria, fled frantically for the protection of our school building.

18:45.621 --> 18:52.650
The spectacle of that boy, although all, chasing a hundred to send support into the school,

18:53.879 --> 18:56.382
remains with me to this day.

18:59.786 --> 19:06.234
Where are they now, the boys I played with, the girls I walk beside?

19:07.155 --> 19:12.362
Where are the young blacks we fought in the senseless, doable bigotry of our youth?

19:13.563 --> 19:17.588
Where is the black Achilles who struck such terror in my heart?

19:18.710 --> 19:22.975
Where are the racer, the holder, the dodger,

19:23.225 --> 19:30.359
Do they still meet the assaults of life as they once met the attacks of angry teachers?

19:30.379 --> 19:38.415
Where the storekeepers greeted us each morning as my sister and I walked proudly beside my father on our way to school?

19:39.475 --> 19:42.319
I know where my father is.

19:42.339 --> 19:48.489
He is dead now, lying great and still beneath the flowered patch of cemetery sun.

19:49.290 --> 20:00.387
How many of the others must be dead as well, their sons and daughters scattered across the country and the world, remembering even as I remember now.

20:00.367 --> 20:25.986
If I could, I would say to them, this is the way it was on those crisp mornings in autumn, when we stuffed our sneakers with the brown wrinkled leaves, those afternoons in early spring, the windows of our classrooms open to the scent of new buds, those twilights in the summer with the mothers calling plaintively as we crouched hidden in the shadows.

20:26.692 --> 20:41.460
While we shared this kingdom of our childhood, lived there as sprinters and fools, first word of joy and sorrow, played against time and games we always won, felt no threat of age and death.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.848
Because you see, then we thought the sun would remain young.

21:00.610 --> 21:04.394
Memories and the nostalgia for the memories.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.919
What's another important ingredient for storytelling?

21:09.740 --> 21:15.307
That which characterizes men and women alone among the animals.

21:15.327 --> 21:17.309
The quality of imagination.

21:18.050 --> 21:26.179
Imagination, simply that capacity to structure something that might have happened, though it did not happen.

21:27.273 --> 21:36.507
We Greeks, again, have both a blessing and a danger inherent in our great heritage.

21:36.527 --> 21:49.467
We tend to believe, in fact, are convinced we are descended from the Gods, and this sometimes can have dreadful ramifications.

21:51.134 --> 22:06.163
I speak of the development of my whole imagination, fed and nurtured by this heroic Greek background, so that on the earth we walk in epic strides.

22:06.183 --> 22:13.817
I began my writing with a writing of poetry, quivering sonnets and ravishing refrains.

22:14.101 --> 22:24.811
very dreadful verses, which my indulgent merits allowed me to read and guests assembled at my father's table on satyata.

22:24.831 --> 22:34.881
When I had finished a pulver, the quality of the words burning my palms, I would carry it to my mother and say, let me read it to the guests.

22:34.901 --> 22:38.945
She'd take me into the dining room and call the guests of my father to attention.

22:39.726 --> 22:43.129
I would stand there reciting one of my verses.

22:43.328 --> 22:52.298
Fortunately for you good people, I can only remember the opening lines of one of those early efforts which went something like this.

22:53.840 --> 23:01.409
Here we all sit around the table, drinking wine from a bottle with a red label.

23:01.429 --> 23:11.901
Our faces eager and our appetites bright as we're all sitting around pretty hungry under the light.

23:11.881 --> 23:15.805
We have poets, good poets in this audience.

23:15.825 --> 23:21.652
It almost shames me to have to confess that, but in the spirit of the talk, I will relay it.

23:22.332 --> 23:26.937
But I was always greeted by enthusiastic applause.

23:26.957 --> 23:37.669
It took me the reason, years to understand the reason for this intemperate and excessive applause, but simply, you see, the guests had either already eaten my mother's good food,

23:37.649 --> 23:44.698
or were about-eated, and in either instance, what did it profit of them to be critics?

23:44.718 --> 23:58.015
Now, the echoes of that contemporary applause lingered in my ears for years, further unbalancing an already unfortunate predilection for unbalancement my dead path from an early age.

23:59.057 --> 24:05.665
By the time I reached the seventh grade of our parochial school, the school attached to my father's church,

24:05.847 --> 24:11.875
I had been designated Storyteller Laureate of the 7th grade class.

24:11.895 --> 24:13.057
Now what did this mean?

24:13.077 --> 24:15.901
This meant simply once or twice a week.

24:15.921 --> 24:27.037
When it came time for the reading of several small stories, my teacher with uncommon sensitivity retained my reading for last.

24:27.057 --> 24:32.384
I used to secretly think of myself like the frosting on a cupcake.

24:32.424 --> 24:33.846
The best for the end.

24:34.366 --> 24:38.514
I can remember as I remember the triumph of Kick the Camp.

24:38.855 --> 24:42.863
I can remember those days when I knew I was going to read.

24:43.223 --> 24:45.989
I couldn't concentrate on my lessons all morning.

24:46.390 --> 24:51.199
When my turn came, the class hushed in anticipation.

24:52.021 --> 24:55.648
I would rise from my desk, which was in the last row of the room.

24:55.628 --> 25:01.537
I would walk slowly to the front of the room, savoring the silence.

25:01.557 --> 25:19.763
When I stood up beside the teacher's vest, the little sheaf of my manuscript in my hand, I would cast a look out across the audience, and finish by looking admirably at a dark-eyed, bare-legged little plump of a girl named Malcolm in the first row.

25:20.063 --> 25:28.132
Oh, there was the loveliest girl in the room, and I and every other boy in the room admired her very much.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.254
I read my manuscript.

25:30.274 --> 25:47.674
When I finished the class burst into spontaneous and enthusiastic applause, I would stand up there lovingly applause, closing my eyes better to enjoy the rhythm of that slander, swaying slight

25:49.004 --> 25:54.336
until my teacher nudged me for me to go back to my seat.

25:54.416 --> 25:59.026
You know how you walk when you're trying to affect a demeanor of modesty?

25:59.587 --> 26:08.346
I walked down the aisle slouching slightly, my eyes downcast, and yet one of them was smitten and baleful.

26:08.326 --> 26:15.133
glaring at some lout in the corner who wasn't applauding with the rest.

26:15.573 --> 26:19.277
I vowed I would improve his enthusiasm at recess.

26:20.498 --> 26:35.714
At night, in the last few moments before going to sleep, I would recount, recapture the triumph of my day and think, what a marvelous thing the writer's life, approval, approbation, applause.

26:35.734 --> 26:37.135
You see, although I was a Greek,

26:37.570 --> 26:54.586
and even as a boy had read the Greek tragedies, I did not yet have wisdom enough to understand the gods punish humorous, the sin of arrogance, in Chicago as well as in thieves.

26:55.848 --> 26:56.710
One day,

26:57.027 --> 26:59.411
In this class, I forgot my lunch at home.

26:59.551 --> 27:03.677
I forgot the little brown bag with my lunch at the dining room at home.

27:03.697 --> 27:05.520
I went to classes.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.582
The morning passed.

27:06.762 --> 27:07.663
Lunchtime came.

27:07.723 --> 27:10.688
My teacher, noticing I had more lunch, asked me where it was.

27:10.768 --> 27:11.850
A simple question.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.654
Harry, where's your lunch?

27:14.674 --> 27:22.907
A simple question deserving a simple, truthful answer, as I am sure all of you would have answered.

27:22.927 --> 27:23.187
But remember,

27:23.572 --> 27:30.002
In this class, I have grown accustomed to delivering my recitations to approval and applause.

27:30.663 --> 27:40.860
And suddenly, the prospect of uttering so commonplace and ordinary a statement as, I forgot it at home, seemed insufferable to me.

27:41.441 --> 27:46.609
And on the spot, my imagination took flight like a Cretan gun.

27:46.589 --> 27:49.574
And I concocted a story which went something like this.

27:49.714 --> 27:57.105
I said, on my way to school this morning, I saw a ragged old man sitting in the gutter.

27:57.125 --> 27:59.489
I stopped and asked the old gentleman what was wrong.

28:00.110 --> 28:04.176
He told me he was very hungry because he had not eaten in two days.

28:04.747 --> 28:17.643
I realized then the only Christian and humane thing for me to do, particularly since my father's the priest, was to give the old man my lunch, which I did.

28:19.065 --> 28:29.218
I am told that small, furtive lie to impress my teacher, and she was impressed beyond my wildest expectations.

28:29.435 --> 28:37.824
She had large dark eyes and I remember in that instant they swelled open till they resembled great bursting cups.

28:37.844 --> 28:40.647
She sent one of my classmates for the principal.

28:40.667 --> 28:46.593
When the principal returned, my teacher called the class to attention.

28:46.653 --> 28:49.636
Class, please stop eating your lunches.

28:51.478 --> 28:56.303
We have all heard Harry read his good stories to us.

28:56.553 --> 29:05.060
Today, he has a true experience to share with us, something that befell him on his way to school.

29:05.080 --> 29:16.450
I want you all to listen very carefully and to take this experience as a model of conduct for you in your own daily lives.

29:16.470 --> 29:22.635
She turned to me and she said, Harry, repeat that experience again.

29:22.655 --> 29:25.918
Now, I had told a small, quick, sneaky,

29:26.354 --> 29:44.596
But suddenly, with the whole class watching and waiting, with the principal standing there, with Olga wondering what I had done, I could not repeat a small, fertile line.

29:44.616 --> 29:52.185
True to my heroic and Homeric background, I had to make it an epic life.

29:53.867 --> 29:54.488
Now,

29:55.345 --> 29:59.771
I spoke of the scuffed and shabby tips of the old man's shoes.

30:00.692 --> 30:06.339
I spoke of his patched and faded trousers looking as if they had been washed many times.

30:06.359 --> 30:08.662
I spoke of the way I knew he was telling me the truth.

30:08.842 --> 30:09.783
He wasn't lying to me.

30:10.244 --> 30:10.965
How did I know?

30:11.285 --> 30:17.974
I said, his fingers trembled with weakness from hunger as he took the bag of lunch from my hands.

30:18.395 --> 30:20.357
I spoke of the tears of gratitude

30:20.675 --> 30:30.805
glistening in the corners of his eyes, and finally I told him how his voice quavered at the end when he thanked me by saying, God bless you, my son.

30:30.825 --> 30:39.134
This is the way I did it, so powerfully, so dramatic, so full of fur and passion.

30:39.154 --> 30:47.222
When I finished, the principal slapped my shoulder, shook my hand, and said, I will never forget his words.

30:50.780 --> 30:58.113
Olga had two great tears running down her lovely cheeks.

30:58.133 --> 31:06.347
And the class was so awed at what I had done, they neglected to applaud.

31:06.527 --> 31:11.556
And I returned now to my seat.

31:12.852 --> 31:23.250
Just before I reached it, it was visited by a great swarm of my classmates who brought me votive offerings of halves of their own lunches.

31:23.270 --> 31:37.375
So when I reached my death, I found it piled high with the halves of bologna and salami sandwiches, or a new and chocolate chip cookies, apples, oranges, bananas.

31:40.848 --> 32:06.295
and left her seat in the first row, and came walking down the aisle, with the grace of a Trojan princess, to my seat in the rear row, and from her own slender and delicate hands, laid upon my desk, one gold juice.

32:07.477 --> 32:10.500
Now, I sat there,

32:11.594 --> 32:22.771
Enjoying this repast, and if I did not feel I deserved it for my integrity, even then I knew what integrity was.

32:22.791 --> 32:28.860
I must confess to you, a little shamefully, since Father Dean has been a story.

32:29.532 --> 32:36.260
I must confess to you that I did feel I deserved it for the fertility of my imagination.

32:36.320 --> 32:45.952
Now, I am recounting an experience, but I am also storytelling.

32:47.153 --> 32:59.168
And the beauty of storytelling is that as the audience and the storyteller mesh more closely together, the storyteller may stop.

32:59.671 --> 33:08.425
And the audience, then caught up in the tale, will continue to unravel the suspense out of the ground.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.710
But first, you must return with me.

33:11.730 --> 33:19.122
You must suspend belief now and make the leap backward in time with me to that classroom.

33:19.142 --> 33:22.067
You see me there, mundanely you.

33:22.908 --> 33:26.252
with the face of a myopic hawk.

33:26.272 --> 33:31.658
See me taking a bite from half the salami sandwich and putting it down.

33:31.678 --> 33:36.604
Responding to the call of a friend on the right who said, Harry, Harry.

33:37.165 --> 33:38.406
I said, yeah.

33:38.426 --> 33:41.650
He said, Harry, how did you ever think to do such a thing?

33:43.032 --> 33:43.993
I said, I don't know.

33:44.894 --> 33:46.416
It just came over me, I guess.

33:48.098 --> 33:49.679
Somebody from the left, Harry.

33:49.800 --> 33:50.440
I said, yeah.

33:51.121 --> 33:51.902
I said, Harry.

33:52.355 --> 34:00.792
you know you'll be number one in the school from now on.

34:00.812 --> 34:03.057
I know, I know, and I deserve it.

34:06.023 --> 34:07.005
When suddenly

34:08.048 --> 34:31.120
The door of my classroom opened, and who do you think appeared?

34:32.129 --> 34:39.163
She was my mother and I loved her.

34:39.183 --> 34:45.676
And I think for one unbalanced moment, I was even glad to see her.

34:45.696 --> 34:53.732
My mother, it wasn't until she entered my room, it wasn't until the teacher who knew her rose to greet her.

34:54.961 --> 35:01.730
It wasn't until the moment my mother handed the teacher the small brown bag at home.

35:02.631 --> 35:12.584
It wasn't until that dreadful moment that I realized that she was something.

35:12.784 --> 35:18.411
You are a good audience, a responsive one.

35:18.431 --> 35:22.757
We are all bound together by the wealth of a tradition.

35:24.172 --> 35:32.391
And I would like to respond to your generosity in coming to hear me tonight by telling you exactly what took place then.

35:32.772 --> 35:36.460
After all, I am placing great stress upon memory.

35:37.975 --> 35:43.726
Unfortunately, I cannot.

35:43.966 --> 35:50.619
That experience was so horrible, I have plodded it from my mind.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.748
One thing I do remember.

35:57.230 --> 36:23.153
how Olga left her seat in the first row and came walking with the grace of a Trojan princess down the aisle to my seat in the rear row and with her slender and delicate fingers reached down to my desk and took back her peach.

36:26.204 --> 36:28.013
Thank you.

36:36.886 --> 36:47.157
One thing more I remember how for weeks afterwards, wherever I walked in the classrooms, in the corridors, in the schoolyard, I could hear them whispering behind me.

36:47.437 --> 36:48.418
What were they whispering?

36:48.999 --> 36:51.221
They're whispering, there goes Harry.

36:51.922 --> 36:57.167
He's the biggest liar.

36:59.089 --> 37:02.473
So many years ago, I was a boy then.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.256
Now I'm a man.

37:05.810 --> 37:07.272
on the threshold of 60.

37:07.292 --> 37:16.624
And I would like to tell you I have reformed.

37:16.784 --> 37:19.208
I am still an incredible liar.

37:19.748 --> 37:28.600
Give me the kernel of an experience and I will so ornament and embellish it, it will become almost unrecognizable in the telling.

37:28.620 --> 37:31.564
Fortunately, my choice of profession

37:32.067 --> 37:36.873
allows me to conceal to some degree this aberration.

37:36.893 --> 37:44.142
A writer is, among other things, a professional liar.

37:44.162 --> 37:56.337
Memories, nostalgia for the memories, imagination, laughter, not merely the capacity to laugh at others which we

37:58.038 --> 38:04.705
to be able to laugh at ourselves and at our own infernities.

38:04.725 --> 38:10.771
What is another important quality for the writer, important quality for you beings?

38:11.592 --> 38:13.774
That is simply compassion.

38:13.795 --> 38:16.177
By compassion I don't mean pity.

38:16.537 --> 38:22.864
I don't mean a patronizing emotion we sometimes feel for those who are not as fortunate as we are.

38:23.148 --> 38:30.797
I mean compassion as an awareness that we are all mortal, that we are all flawed creatures.

38:30.817 --> 38:37.345
Yet, when we look at them, when we examine the flaws, we see they often bear their own validity.

38:38.627 --> 38:53.104
Society condemns the prostitute, the harlot, but the writer who seeks to understand must come to recognize there are pines, perhaps, when a wanton woman could be a friend of all this.

38:55.193 --> 38:57.235
Society mocks the coward.

38:57.255 --> 38:58.697
What good is a coward?

38:58.717 --> 39:05.725
He is the exact opposite of what we have come to venerate in a Clint Eastwood and James Bond movie.

39:05.746 --> 39:09.170
But the coward knows what it is to be frightened.

39:09.190 --> 39:14.376
Because of that, he may be able to condemn others who are inferior.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.879
Society mocks the fool.

39:17.620 --> 39:17.800
The fool.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.942
What good is a fool?

39:19.962 --> 39:24.728
But the fool may be able to overcome the suspicion of wiser men and women.

39:25.467 --> 39:34.721
give food to someone who is truly hungry, or the wiser person will say they're trying to deceive the enemy.

39:34.741 --> 39:40.650
Now a twin of compassion is simply the tragic sense.

39:42.133 --> 39:45.959
This is a difficult thing in a way to grasp.

39:46.479 --> 39:50.766
It is something we all to one extent or another feel.

39:51.775 --> 39:55.141
and yet difficult at times to articulate.

39:56.463 --> 40:08.343
And the tragic sense is merely that awareness, that death is a perimeter around all our lives, that the sun rises in the morning and the sun sets in light.

40:08.363 --> 40:13.272
And in the space of that day, we have grown a day longer.

40:13.292 --> 40:16.517
The cycle carries through the relentless

40:21.391 --> 40:27.419
As children standing under a light sky full of stars, we quiver with expectation.

40:27.459 --> 40:33.707
We wait the ascent of the sun we feel will shine in us forever.

40:33.727 --> 40:43.520
As we grow older, involved in the turmoil of living, we come to experience death, illness, suffering, suffering.

40:44.261 --> 40:49.288
But even as we watch those we love grow ill, sometimes die,

40:50.146 --> 41:05.280
The living of life allows us to begin to discern the pattern that exists in the cycle of the seasons, the present, the past, and the future, the living, the dead, and the unborn.

41:05.300 --> 41:18.972
From the tug of wind to the fall of a raindrop, the flutter of a moth's wings, we move across eternity to the stunning image of Jupiter brought back by the cameras in the satellite.

41:20.217 --> 41:30.509
We sense in some way the linkage of these things without being able to define other poets and philosophers of trauma.

41:30.529 --> 41:36.255
We who cannot see the thousand subtle bonds by chance, they are there.

41:37.837 --> 41:46.967
With that inner vision which comes to us through the living of our lives, we begin to sense that subtle connection of all things.

41:47.420 --> 41:52.989
That is the tragic sense, that tragic awareness.

41:53.009 --> 42:05.771
So even as we grieve for others who pass on ourselves, we hear the laughter of our children, the whisper of young lovers, and the joy and clamor of celebrations.

42:05.791 --> 42:11.841
We applaud the vision of the artist's art, of the poet's poet.

42:13.137 --> 42:20.909
With that battered understanding which comes to Paul, we begin to recognize the truth of St.

42:21.290 --> 42:38.416
Paul's utterance, who asks us to beareth all things, to holdeth all things, to believeth all things, and to endureth all things.

42:38.437 --> 42:40.680
I speak, as I have said,

42:41.858 --> 42:43.380
in so many places.

42:44.802 --> 42:49.890
And I counted a great good fortune.

42:49.910 --> 42:58.382
Because in the speaking, I owe many of the things I think we feel in our lives.

42:58.403 --> 43:08.878
I feel that in speaking, I am given the opportunity to articulate many things that we feel in the loneliness of our own problems.

43:10.698 --> 43:20.175
As children remember how we would wake in our father and mother's houses, cloistered and protected.

43:20.195 --> 43:25.685
They and sisters and brothers who slept in rooms and around our own.

43:25.705 --> 43:27.909
Some or others, they secured our lives.

43:28.009 --> 43:32.337
They acted as sentries around us in the darkness.

43:32.357 --> 43:34.461
How different it is for us not.

43:35.015 --> 43:49.875
I wait now in my house beside my wife, father and mother dead, sisters and brothers of the way, sons of Rome and God from our house.

43:49.895 --> 43:58.407
I lie there and find it difficult to fall back soon, thinking of all that mass of things all of us face in our lives.

43:58.387 --> 44:07.441
unfulfilled contracts and unnamed goals and the difficulty of relationships that exist on ours.

44:07.461 --> 44:20.901
And I think then, if one wishes to understand the difference between the night that we experienced as children and nights that we experienced as adults in the maturity of our lives,

44:27.209 --> 44:32.161
I am now, I said, on the threshold of 60.

44:32.682 --> 44:40.360
Now that is not old, but it is certainly no longer gone.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.848
I am the writer of 10 books.

44:43.868 --> 44:45.572
I have some written articles and stories.

44:46.177 --> 44:49.761
I have been puzzled to one woman.

44:49.781 --> 44:59.173
I do not say that as a lament, but to say that at least in that way I am more successful than Norman Mailer at Salt Lake.

44:59.193 --> 45:03.578
I have looked into the faces of many men.

45:04.039 --> 45:06.762
I have heard the foolishness they spoke.

45:06.782 --> 45:10.567
I have uttered many possibilities myself.

45:10.587 --> 45:13.230
I have learned much, forgotten much.

45:24.787 --> 45:32.665
I've also learned that we are not all destined regardless of what we anticipate as children.

45:32.685 --> 45:37.395
We are not all destined in our lives.
