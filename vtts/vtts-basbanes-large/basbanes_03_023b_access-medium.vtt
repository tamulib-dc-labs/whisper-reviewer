WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:09.739
Very interesting because of Carlisle's whole relationship to German literature and German thought.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.086
You know, it's a very interesting connection there.

00:14.106 --> 00:18.133
At any rate, I then wrote a note to Hugh Trevor Roper.

00:18.193 --> 00:24.724
I was a student, a graduate student, and said, you say that this book was Hitler's favorite book.

00:24.804 --> 00:29.211
I just want you to know I have his copy of the book with his book plate,

00:29.663 --> 00:38.036
And he wrote back, and he said, yes, it was clearly a favorite book, and would you like to come by for tea, and I'd like to see the book.

00:38.056 --> 00:43.023
He wanted, obviously, to see whether it had annotations in addition to everything else.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.145
It has no annotations.

00:44.165 --> 00:45.206
Of course, I checked that.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.488
I was a young scholar.

00:46.528 --> 00:48.070
That would have interested me greatly.

00:48.311 --> 00:59.147
The only thing I could tell was that Hitler, someone at any rate, had read the book carefully, because the ribbon with the top edge was gilt, and the ribbon, you could see that

00:59.363 --> 01:03.788
It had been moved all the way through and made marks all the way through in a regular.

01:03.828 --> 01:05.630
It had been read from beginning to end.

01:05.970 --> 01:07.953
Yeah, read from beginning to end.

01:08.013 --> 01:08.794
You could tell that.

01:09.554 --> 01:14.840
And so I had tea with Hugh Trevor Roper, and he said, oh, yes, this, and he looked at it and everything.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.002
It was very interesting.

01:17.644 --> 01:26.113
This was before, as I mentioned, he had later authenticated the Diaries of Hitler, and he lost his credibility for authenticating things, I'm afraid.

01:27.106 --> 01:27.727
I went back.

01:27.847 --> 01:29.008
Your book quite is pretty persuasive.

01:29.028 --> 01:29.649
Yeah, yeah.

01:30.169 --> 01:44.763
I went back, and then we had our... The next thing that happened was, as a member of the Oxford Society of Bibliophiles, we had that term's final meeting, which was always held in John Sparrow's lodgings as a warden of all souls.

01:45.404 --> 01:48.407
And so we had a meeting with John Sparrow.

01:48.587 --> 01:51.010
Everybody's supposed to bring a favorite book.

01:51.030 --> 01:54.413
And John Sparrow had that habit always of, once you showed your book,

01:54.781 --> 01:58.266
then he would go upstairs to his personal library and bring down something better.

01:59.127 --> 02:01.831
If you had a first edition, he had an inscribed copy.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.014
If you had an inscribed copy, the same author.

02:04.194 --> 02:07.158
If you had an inscribed copy, you had an inscribed with a person's mother.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.543
I hardly ever saw him stumped.

02:11.243 --> 02:19.895
But I gave this copy, and then he sat, and he said, I'm sorry, I don't have anything to match this.

02:19.935 --> 02:21.177
He said, I do have a copy of

02:21.899 --> 02:26.886
Mein Kampf first edition, but he said, I can hardly bring that down to show.

02:27.387 --> 02:36.900
And then he said, Mr. Mitchell, we never, I'm going to ask you a question we never asked at the Society of WFIL, which you guessed, how much did that cost?

02:37.100 --> 02:38.602
And I said, well, it was five pounds.

02:38.662 --> 02:44.790
And he said, if you give it to me, I can tell you how much Mags paid for it in 45, because their code word was harlequin.

02:45.051 --> 02:47.734
He looked in the back, and they had paid three pounds for it.

02:47.815 --> 02:48.876
The letters were such.

02:48.896 --> 02:49.577
Twenty years earlier.

02:49.793 --> 02:54.379
Three pounds, twenty years earlier, they'd take one.

02:54.399 --> 02:58.484
He's still fed up on eBay today, 80 books.

02:58.504 --> 02:58.824
Yeah, yeah.

02:58.844 --> 02:59.104
That's right.

02:59.124 --> 03:01.427
So, uh... Where did Sparrow's collection go, by the way?

03:01.447 --> 03:03.610
I'm not sure about his own collection.

03:03.990 --> 03:05.192
He was quite a collector.

03:05.232 --> 03:07.094
But this killer collection must have gone someplace.

03:07.114 --> 03:07.955
Yeah.

03:07.975 --> 03:08.536
I don't know.

03:08.596 --> 03:09.657
That's a good question.

03:09.677 --> 03:14.603
I actually helped in the sense of anybody he knew, interested in books, he'd have him look out.

03:14.785 --> 03:23.192
I remember he was asking me to look out for something that I found that he was able to purchase and add to his collection.

03:23.933 --> 03:24.633
But that was it.

03:24.674 --> 03:27.516
Then the other thing was that I have kept it with me, of course.

03:27.856 --> 03:33.361
It's for the Lilly Library, but I have it still myself at the moment.

03:33.881 --> 03:43.830
And I had it in my home, and that's when I brought in a friend of mine, a colleague, Alvin Rosenfeld, who's the head of Jewish studies, and written a book on Hitler and the Holocaust and literature.

03:44.620 --> 03:48.184
And there was a... I had not really meant to shock him.

03:48.224 --> 03:55.091
I just thought he'd be interested, and I was going to sort of surprise him by showing him a book without telling him in advance.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.693
Now, here's a book from Hitler's library.

03:57.233 --> 04:00.417
So I said, I think you might be interested in this book, and I handed it to him.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.959
And he said, oh, like, very interesting.

04:03.500 --> 04:08.025
And then he opened it and just went white and started to tremble.

04:08.085 --> 04:12.990
And I hadn't realized that it might even be considered

04:13.308 --> 04:24.961
cruel or something on my part, or certainly thoughtless or tactless, to spring a book like that on someone who was so deeply connected with the whole suffering of the Jewish people and the Holocaust.

04:25.742 --> 04:29.426
And so we talked about it, and I told him, and so forth.

04:29.486 --> 04:40.719
And then he went back, and he wrote a story, eventually, a short story, published, I think, in... It was published in a periodical, and I have to find the name of it.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.201
I can't remember.

04:42.704 --> 04:47.671
Oh, that was the name under which I sold books when I heard these things.

04:48.212 --> 05:04.314
So in this periodical, Alvin Rosenfeld wrote a fictional story about a man who's invited to a supposed friend's house and then suddenly shown, without any warning, a copy of a book that belonged to Hibner and what the emotional reaction was.

05:04.334 --> 05:12.205
And because they haven't come to get me yet, you were saying that all the books from the Tricking the Mind of Man exhibition, one thing they all have in common is that they look backwards

05:12.742 --> 05:17.769
And then you said, well, what about the books that look forward?

05:17.789 --> 05:19.792
And that's where the conversation ended.

05:19.812 --> 05:21.054
What were you suggesting there?

05:21.074 --> 05:32.910
No, I was just meaning that once you have this canon established, the canon is always something that is like Monday Morning Quarterback.

05:33.211 --> 05:51.749
we look back on in order to decide what those books are, but they're books that have had, you know, their impact is finished, so in a sense, they're books not finished, of course their impact continues, but somehow that whole thing is a matter of establishing a canon and you look back at it.

05:52.690 --> 05:59.657
When you start to think about what the future is, what are the books of the future to look forward, I only meant by that

05:59.924 --> 06:01.867
Understanding now.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.049
What is it now?

06:03.289 --> 06:09.760
We try to collect here books that we think 300 years from now people will care about.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.362
And do you actually follow that principle?

06:11.382 --> 06:13.646
I mean, are you looking ahead 300 years?

06:13.746 --> 06:14.788
Yes, absolutely.

06:15.870 --> 06:24.784
This is why we collect on standing orders such a broad range of British and American authors, for example, because we want 300 years from now someone

06:25.102 --> 06:36.980
who says, oh, the great author of the early 20th century was X. We'd like to have all the first editions of that author in very nice condition, not to have missed out on them totally some way.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.064
So broadly collecting is one way.

06:40.084 --> 06:45.773
But another one I think I mentioned was that we did buy the first edition of Mao's Little Red Book.

06:46.313 --> 06:52.142
There probably aren't a lot of libraries looking for that or collecting it right now.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.906
I think there's no doubt, but what if there's a printing

06:55.308 --> 07:01.815
and the Mind of Man extension, that's got to be one of the books that would be interesting to be in such a collection.

07:01.835 --> 07:04.437
And also, you want things that are global now.

07:05.038 --> 07:09.522
Most of our printing in the Mind of Man has been really Eurocentric in the past.

07:09.603 --> 07:16.289
The future is going to be much more global, and therefore work like Mao coming out of China is going to be important.

07:16.309 --> 07:22.636
And there are probably important things appearing around the world that we'll be interested in, too.

07:22.656 --> 07:24.638
Does that mean to draw you into this?

07:24.658 --> 07:24.758
Yeah.

07:25.177 --> 07:31.906
debate, but when you talk about global books, will they have to be printed books, do you think?

07:31.946 --> 07:35.090
That kind of an impact can come from an artifact.

07:35.711 --> 07:42.099
No, and it is a different question of how we deal with preserving the future in rare books and manuscripts.

07:42.600 --> 07:50.610
Well, we have many authors now who say to me, you want my papers, does that mean you want the discs?

07:51.080 --> 07:55.886
also, or you want my electronic files, you want my email.

07:56.227 --> 08:03.276
Right now I'm saying, yes, send us your disks and copy out your emails or send them by attachment, whatever.

08:03.596 --> 08:07.882
That's the correspondence we have, and we have to figure out how to preserve it.

08:07.922 --> 08:13.089
But I think I'm one of the people who believes that the book will last forever.

08:13.129 --> 08:19.517
The book is such a wonderful thing, and it has so much to it beyond the text itself.

08:19.767 --> 08:25.963
The physical artifact of the book is absolutely, I think, going to last for hundreds of years.

08:25.983 --> 08:29.953
It's only the second day I go on this camera, but I don't have anything hard.

08:30.995 --> 08:32.379
This is all zeros and ones.

08:32.439 --> 08:33.642
I don't have a negative.

08:33.740 --> 08:34.381
Yeah.

08:34.401 --> 08:37.305
And I have quite an archive of photographs.

08:37.325 --> 08:38.627
I'm dealing with it.

08:38.647 --> 08:40.169
I'm going to make hard copies.

08:40.189 --> 08:40.650
I have to.

08:40.670 --> 08:41.992
You better make hard copies.

08:42.012 --> 08:44.155
Otherwise, transfer it over to a hard disk or something.

08:44.175 --> 08:50.284
You see in these disks, actually, the disks mostly eventually are going to be useless, but there'll be no machine that can play those disks.

08:50.685 --> 08:51.546
Absolutely true.

08:51.606 --> 08:55.051
So I say print out on nice paper.

08:55.071 --> 08:57.234
We'll print out what we can of everything.

08:57.254 --> 08:58.636
It's like those old faxes.

08:58.676 --> 09:01.581
We have to make copies on archival papers of faxes.

09:01.861 --> 09:02.582
They're fading.

09:02.967 --> 09:06.751
almost unreadable now, many important things that were facts.

09:06.851 --> 09:09.074
And now we have to take care of that.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.755
Napoleon was a great leader.

09:11.156 --> 09:11.396
Yeah.

09:11.556 --> 09:20.526
And I wonder if it's been documented how any of his books might have influenced any of his books.

09:20.546 --> 09:24.390
You had mentioned Mussolini and Mussolini's copy of Machiavelli.

09:24.410 --> 09:28.114
Yeah, being up in Canada with somebody up in Canada.

09:28.448 --> 09:36.019
I'm trying to think.

09:36.039 --> 09:51.761
Malcolm Bradbury, whose papers we have here, wrote a book called To the Hermitage, and one of the ways that he got into the book, you'd find it interesting to read, was he was interested in the library at the time, too, and what had happened to some of the books from St.

09:51.781 --> 09:56.548
Petersburg and had been in the Royal Library and so forth.

09:57.457 --> 10:02.723
The history of libraries and what happens to them, of course, obviously, is fascinating.

10:03.324 --> 10:21.706
But what I'm thinking about in terms of printing in the mind of men and to be open to at least thinking about beyond literature itself and certainly beyond British and American literature, what works are important in the history of the mind that we should be getting right now or recognizing right now.

10:22.006 --> 10:26.772
One of the things I mentioned was there are important developments in philosophy, for instance, which

10:27.123 --> 10:31.668
I think the lily is behind on, we need to catch up with.

10:32.229 --> 10:36.853
So there'll be major developments in philosophy in the 20th century.

10:37.614 --> 10:49.607
One reason that I like John Ranofsky as a bookseller is because he's opened up to and done catalogs in some new areas that people should be collecting in if they haven't been.

10:49.627 --> 10:54.953
He's done a nice catalog on philosophy, for instance, and philosophical things.

10:55.422 --> 11:03.653
He's just interested, I think, in a broader range of what is worth preserving than the traditional range of British and American literature.

11:03.673 --> 11:08.319
You get a new bookseller in one of my books, instead of the old cast of characters.

11:08.780 --> 11:19.274
John's always interesting, too, because he's a controversial character, because he almost single-handedly has raised the level of cost of the market and so forth.

11:19.294 --> 11:24.180
A lot of people have found that the sorts of prices he puts on things

11:24.532 --> 11:48.448
have skewed the market upward, makes it more difficult for them to buy and sell, but he's gone out in areas in which nobody's collecting anything and put out catalogs and tried to create collectors as authors try to create readers, and he has done that, and he puts prices on them that he thinks they're worth.

11:48.468 --> 11:53.796
I mean, he'll say, you know, this is the first edition of this philosophical work inscribed

11:54.063 --> 11:57.552
to another philosopher, you know, this should be a $2,000 book.

11:57.612 --> 12:01.742
Well, it may be a book that is selling for $50 anywhere else.

12:02.223 --> 12:06.113
He's putting down the prices that he thinks they're... That's a good question.

12:06.133 --> 12:06.474
We've covered it.

12:06.514 --> 12:08.258
Okay, yeah, that'll spare it.

12:08.660 --> 12:17.836
Oh, this was Samuel Beckett's copy of King Lear.

12:20.340 --> 12:26.651
Well, first of all, this is my opinion, but I think it's true.

12:26.792 --> 12:31.680
Samuel Beckett is the most important dramatist of the 20th century.

12:32.504 --> 12:39.115
He's had a greater influence, a greater impact, a greater figure in 20th century literature than any other dramatist.

12:39.135 --> 12:42.821
You can think of Bertolt Brecht or George Bernard Shaw or something, nobody.

12:42.901 --> 12:45.746
And he only wrote in the second half of the 20th century.

12:45.766 --> 12:51.094
So we have what I consider, the person I consider to be the greatest dramatist of the 20th century.

12:52.256 --> 12:58.326
And this is his copy of one of the greatest works of dramatic literature, Shakespeare.

12:59.285 --> 13:05.912
Shakespeare clearly had an impact on Beckett, as Shakespeare had an impact on every important writer.

13:06.673 --> 13:18.586
And this notion that here's a book that he read when he was a schoolboy, and that he wrote in, and he annotated, and he practiced his signature in, you know.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.789
And who's the woman who owns this book, Helen?

13:21.349 --> 13:29.038
Helen, now I can't think of her last name, because we're always just first name, and I can't speak, but...

13:29.305 --> 13:39.179
Yeah, she has the book, and the story of it is that she loved Beckett, and we often talked about Beckett, even before I became director of the Lily.

13:39.660 --> 13:56.865
But she went back home to get some of her school books from her childhood home, just to have them because of sentimental attachment, having no idea that her copy of King Lear that she used in school and bought from a used bookstore was Samuel Beckett's copy.

13:57.217 --> 14:03.487
She had read it and used it so long ago before she ever knew Beckett from her home in Ireland.

14:03.527 --> 14:05.269
I'm not sure what city it was in.

14:05.830 --> 14:11.679
So she came back and she said, look, Breon, among my school books was this copy of King Lear.

14:11.699 --> 14:12.140
Look at it.

14:12.180 --> 14:15.805
She opened it up and it says Samuel Beckett with his address and the date.

14:16.366 --> 14:25.941
And on the title page is the word catastrophe, which of course is a word that relates technically to tragic drama.

14:26.225 --> 14:30.251
at the moment of turn in the tragic drama, Catastrophe.

14:30.672 --> 14:40.167
It also happens to be the title of a play by Samuel Beckett, a play that he dedicated to Václav Havel, the president of the Czech Republic.

14:40.187 --> 14:42.210
How old do you think Beckett was when he had been?

14:42.230 --> 14:52.246
Well, we know exactly how old he was, but he would have been probably 14 or 15 when he was doing this, maybe a little younger, 14, maybe a little younger.

14:52.286 --> 14:53.428
He covered everything.

14:53.448 --> 14:53.548
Yeah.

14:53.950 --> 14:54.673
Thank you.

14:54.693 --> 14:55.497
Yeah, oh, you're welcome.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.064
I'm sorry.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.579
No, no, and Joel's coming up all the time.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.728
Timing is just right.
