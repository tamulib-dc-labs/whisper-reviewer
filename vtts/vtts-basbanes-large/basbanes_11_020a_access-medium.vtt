00:02.883 --> 00:12.235
The books are running about 4,000 a day, and at the moment we're quite ahead on the process of moving books in.

00:12.255 --> 00:15.098
We're not allowed to take photographs, unfortunately.

00:15.138 --> 00:17.982
That's a rule from the department, not from our ruling.

00:18.583 --> 00:25.772
So what we'll do is we'll go over to the other side of the piano so you get an idea of the view, and I can explain more about how the building is.

00:28.235 --> 00:28.796
It's beautiful.

00:30.638 --> 00:32.400
And how long has this been in construction?

00:32.583 --> 00:40.314
The foundation stone was laid in 1982, and construction project began around about that time.

00:40.715 --> 01:00.885
This was a railway goods yard, and there's 12 acres of land on this side, and it came up for purchase, probably one of the few sites in central London this large that would actually come up for purchase at the time, so the Department of National Heritage, or the Office of Arts and Libraries,

01:01.203 --> 01:07.771
whatever it was at that time, purchased this land and construction started on the site.

01:07.811 --> 01:12.377
There were various restrictions about what we could and what couldn't be done about it.

01:12.757 --> 01:27.075
The idea of a library goes back, perhaps even to the 1950s, when they wanted to extend at the front of the British Museum building down in Bloomsbury, further out across from the front of the museum, down towards Holborn.

01:28.237 --> 01:31.241
and at the time those plans were rejected.

01:31.782 --> 01:33.705
So the architect, Professor Colin St.

01:33.725 --> 01:41.136
John Wilson, has been working on the initial designs for that part of the project back in the 50s.

01:41.516 --> 01:45.923
But I bring you back to here because you just get this wonderful view.

01:46.804 --> 01:47.785
As you look at the St.

01:47.805 --> 01:55.797
Cancras station just over here and our building, you get to that point where the buildings merge and the bricks

01:56.350 --> 02:02.499
For our building, the clay for the bricks came from the same quarry as the clay for the bricks that were on St.

02:02.559 --> 02:03.621
Pancras Station.

02:04.422 --> 02:10.310
And we've used some 10 million hand-made bricks in the construction of this building, is my card by the way.

02:11.672 --> 02:12.113
Thank you.

02:13.915 --> 02:19.103
And the slate, they have now been cleaning up on St.

02:19.143 --> 02:20.064
Pancras Station.

02:20.966 --> 02:25.412
And they've got green slate and we've got grey, and they're supposed to be the same colour.

02:25.848 --> 02:40.287
They've come from Wales, and one of the things in the construction is that we've used all the grey flakes in the quarry, so when they've come to redo, we've taken it all out.

02:40.788 --> 02:50.961
But as the building is, as we're looking at it now, on this left-hand side here is where the bookshop is, the exhibition gallery,

02:51.481 --> 02:58.434
the Manuscripts Reading Room and Rare Books Reading Room, and eventually here at the back there will be the Humanities Reading Room.

02:58.454 --> 03:14.265
The slated area right in the middle here is the entrance hall area, and then as you come across to this side, where the green shutters are, these are the Science Reading Room, and further back upon the complete ahead of the Oriental Reading Room,

03:14.482 --> 03:25.500
and we come to the very front of the building, in here, and where the round hole is, as it were, and that part of the structure there, that is the auditorium where we'll finish up this afternoon.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.984
And so where will you be storing all the books and manuscripts?

03:28.184 --> 03:31.189
Right, well, we're actually standing on top of an eight-story building.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.052
Okay, all right.

03:33.073 --> 03:35.597
Yes, they're four basements, and they're double pint.

03:36.879 --> 03:40.084
And they go from about where the fence line is, over here,

03:40.874 --> 03:44.858
to roughly where the top of the slates are.

03:45.359 --> 03:51.746
And the wedge shape of the site is also the shape of the basement.

03:51.766 --> 03:52.987
Will we be able to see any of this?

03:53.127 --> 03:55.450
We can't get into the basements, unfortunately.

03:56.151 --> 04:02.738
What they had to do was they had to use a new method for construction at the time called top-down construction.

04:03.219 --> 04:06.342
If you can imagine digging a hole large enough

04:06.642 --> 04:08.064
to go down deep enough.

04:08.344 --> 04:16.055
What would have happened is that the package station in these flats here wouldn't have fallen into the holes.

04:16.376 --> 04:21.443
So they laid and excavated under it and then supported.

04:21.864 --> 04:25.629
Then excavated, supported, excavated, supported, right the way down.

04:25.649 --> 04:28.112
That's why it took 15 years, I would say.

04:28.172 --> 04:34.962
And round the outside of the site, because of the rising water table in London, they've actually put a homeable membrane as well.

04:36.072 --> 04:40.076
How are we protecting the books and manuscripts from this rising water table?

04:41.097 --> 04:48.805
Through the membrane, etc., the solidness of the walls, the controlled environment down there.

04:48.825 --> 04:54.211
We're going to aim to increase the life of a book in this building by about four times as much as we can currently.

04:54.932 --> 04:55.693
From what to what?

04:57.094 --> 04:59.717
I think we're going up to about 300 years.

05:00.963 --> 05:16.643
Currently, if you're in the round reading room area, the stacks there, there's no control over the temperature as such, and so in the winter it's very, very cold, in the winter it's very, very hot, and the station running down the walls, etc.

05:16.663 --> 05:22.230
So you mean four times without any intervention on the book itself, without any conservation procedures?

05:22.710 --> 05:29.839
The basements are split into various compartments down there, so that if, in the case of a fire,

05:30.595 --> 05:35.441
The fire doors come down, and they're strong enough to hold off a fire for two hours.

05:36.902 --> 05:42.309
And the sprinkler system, there's actually a sprinkler system in the building.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.112
They looked at using gas and things like that.

05:45.212 --> 05:45.793
So it's water.

05:46.153 --> 05:47.655
Having people in there as well.

05:48.316 --> 05:49.397
Water system.

05:49.417 --> 05:53.442
But that will actually only come on in that particular compartment, so that particular area.

05:53.502 --> 05:54.703
Kind of like a ship almost.

05:54.903 --> 05:55.124
Yeah.

05:55.144 --> 05:56.565
Watertight compartments in a ship.

05:57.126 --> 05:59.809
But for the system to actually come on,

05:59.958 --> 06:03.525
two adjacent smoke alarms trigger off.

06:04.006 --> 06:08.855
So one will go off, and all the circuits will be changed.

06:09.175 --> 06:11.239
So there's a redundant system in other words.

06:11.259 --> 06:14.325
And then if an adjacent one comes on, then the doors come down, etc.

06:14.445 --> 06:18.273
And that area becomes where it is.

06:18.293 --> 06:22.641
We have freezers in the building, in the basement areas, so that we can make...

06:22.908 --> 06:25.071
If there were all the damage, put them in.

06:25.191 --> 06:28.515
You freeze the books immediately and then you can conserve them, right?

06:28.555 --> 06:41.911
When there was the fire at the library in Norwich, the large supermarket such as Safeways and Sainsbury's and people like that gave freezer space so they could get their books in and get them... Did you know that happened?

06:41.931 --> 06:42.251
I didn't.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.152
When was that fire?

06:43.933 --> 06:46.536
Well, we were in 1997, 1995.

06:46.887 --> 06:48.610
How bad did you lose a lot of books?

06:48.630 --> 06:50.214
They lost a lot of books, yes.

06:50.254 --> 06:54.442
They lost lots of things from that time.

06:54.462 --> 06:56.947
That's right.

06:57.989 --> 06:58.891
Isn't that great?

06:58.951 --> 06:59.572
What's under here?

06:59.793 --> 07:06.566
Under here is a statue of Newton, based on Blake's design, which has been designed by Eduardo Palazzi.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.849
Oh, really?

07:08.099 --> 07:28.442
Mark, my book is two years away.

07:28.482 --> 07:33.448
At some point, will I be able to acquire some official photographs of this facility to use in this book?

07:33.749 --> 07:34.790
I would have thought so, yes.

07:34.870 --> 07:36.693
I can do that probably through Jane, I would imagine.

07:36.713 --> 07:43.381
Through Jane and the preface.

07:45.444 --> 07:47.507
Is the statue in fact under there right now?

07:47.527 --> 07:48.949
It's under there, she's in place.

07:49.129 --> 07:49.890
Okay, great.

07:49.910 --> 07:53.254
It's going to be unveiled at possibly opening ceremonies, etc.

07:53.294 --> 07:54.215
When will there be?

07:54.235 --> 07:57.860
We're opening reading room services on the 24th of November this year.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.402
We might come, we never know.

07:59.720 --> 08:11.815
There will be a formal opening to the building, of course, which that is being done, hopefully, by Her Majesty, by the Queen, or whoever the monarch will be at the time, shall we say.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.619
So that's all there now.

08:14.659 --> 08:18.163
It's a very exciting time in the library, now we've started to move the books in.

08:20.045 --> 08:26.233
Bearing in mind that as the books are being moved in, they are still part of a working collection.

08:26.517 --> 08:30.386
So if a reader requests a book, they will have to go back from here.

08:30.406 --> 08:34.837
So it's sort of like that kind of, this is the current reading room and this is this building.

08:34.877 --> 08:39.869
It's almost like exchanging and as we get more and more books, there'll be the changeover.

08:39.889 --> 08:41.353
So this is currently like a storehouse.

08:41.671 --> 08:43.875
And then it will become a reading room.

08:43.895 --> 08:48.061
So once we've got enough books in this part of the library, then to go to reading room services.

08:48.302 --> 08:51.507
So are the books coming in quite systematically then by shelving?

08:51.567 --> 08:53.490
So are they starting low and moving up?

08:53.530 --> 08:55.894
They've actually started, I think it's basically before.

08:56.214 --> 09:05.690
I've been down there once, and after seeing for such a long time all this shelving empty, to start to see books on the shelving is very, very exciting.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.995
And in the basement there's various types of shelving.

09:09.093 --> 09:22.447
There's shelving where the material can be placed flat and be pulled out, and there's multiple shelving, there's shelving for microfiche, there's static shelving, there's various types of shelving for there.

09:25.009 --> 09:30.355
Do you have any comparison with the Bibliotech National, with the type of library that you've opened?

09:30.375 --> 09:32.257
Jane may know more about that.

09:32.677 --> 09:37.682
I'm not particularly au fait with what's been going on at the Bibliotech National.

09:38.033 --> 09:42.659
The main entrance for our users will be through the gates here, through the portico here.

09:44.682 --> 09:48.587
People ask, why have we got this huge area here?

09:49.147 --> 09:58.500
Part of the restrictions were that in the London Borough of Camden, which is where the building is placed, there aren't that many open areas for members of the public, park areas and things like that.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.104
So this has to be an open space, and this is actually four members of the public.

10:02.124 --> 10:04.227
Any member of the public can come in here.

10:04.612 --> 10:13.501
and use the piazza, because they're going to have access to people who have access to the bookshop, have access to exhibition galleries, the restaurant area, etc.

10:13.921 --> 10:15.603
So, you know, it's a public building.

10:16.123 --> 10:18.686
So there's going to be lots going on in and around this area.

10:18.806 --> 10:21.268
But the same rules for readers apply, however.

10:21.329 --> 10:25.693
Readers' passes will be issued on a need-to-use basis.

10:25.713 --> 10:27.495
We're bringing together two different schools of thought.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.877
In the science reading rooms currently,

10:30.211 --> 10:33.854
You just sign the visitor's book when you arrive, and you go in and use the reading room.

10:33.874 --> 10:37.258
In humanities areas, you have to have a reader's path.

10:37.538 --> 10:38.879
So we're bringing that together.

10:39.420 --> 10:47.827
And what you'll end up with is a path to the library, as opposed to, say, a path to a particular area within the library.

10:48.288 --> 10:58.277
So, for example, some of our users, perhaps in the patent community, who need to search patents and scientific literature, may need a journal that is held in humanities collections,

10:58.763 --> 11:10.981
example being something like Toy Trader Journal, can, rather than now, currently can go all the way over to the humanities, get a pass, et cetera, in this building they'll be able to read all that material at the same desk.

11:12.022 --> 11:12.843
You'd bring this to them.

11:12.863 --> 11:13.885
You'd bring it to them.

11:13.905 --> 11:16.829
So it's bringing together two different ideas.

11:16.929 --> 11:19.413
And how do they streamline the retrieval system?

11:19.493 --> 11:25.121
I mean, if I ask for a book that I'm reading, what's the projected time from the amount of time I ask?

11:25.141 --> 11:28.686
The objective time at the moment is 80% of book requests within 20 minutes.

11:29.543 --> 11:30.104
And that's here?

11:31.125 --> 11:31.205
Yes.

11:31.225 --> 11:37.552
Currently, you can order a book from a building in south London, and it's a day, two days.

11:40.475 --> 11:45.060
We'll see a little bit of the system, what is going on.

11:45.481 --> 11:46.662
We'll go into the building.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.644
I've told them so that they know.

11:49.065 --> 11:54.330
There's actually, as a word of warning, there is an event happening in the south, in the entrance.

11:54.651 --> 11:57.694
You've come on a good day, because...

11:57.978 --> 12:05.050
they are knocking down the partition wall between the first phase and the completion phase.

12:05.070 --> 12:10.900
And so it'll be the first time that, as you walk, hopefully, I don't know how far they've got, I've not been in, you'll be able to see the King's Library.

12:11.201 --> 12:11.822
Oh, really?

12:11.842 --> 12:13.004
Oh, yeah.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.066
That's happening this afternoon.

12:14.206 --> 12:17.151
And it's also the architect's 75th birthday.

12:17.485 --> 12:19.788
So this is quite a rather important day, isn't it?

12:19.808 --> 12:22.632
He's been working on this for the past 15 years.

12:22.652 --> 12:27.959
He's been working on the idea of construction of a national library for the past 30 years.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.104
So he's been involved in the project from there.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.808
And he's invited lots of friends around.

12:34.828 --> 12:37.772
Apparently Pilotsy might be here this afternoon as well.

12:38.056 --> 12:40.820
So we're going to be sort of sculpting around all that's going on.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.141
That's exciting, that's exciting.

12:42.301 --> 12:46.527
But it'd be quite interesting when we get into the entrance hall to see how far.

12:46.827 --> 12:50.732
They're calling it the part, the unification.

12:52.555 --> 12:54.437
What kind of stone is this here, the light?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.621
Purbeck and Portland stone out here.

12:58.382 --> 13:04.570
And throughout there's various lights, all these roundels on the front.

13:04.904 --> 13:09.191
And this area here, the curved area is the bookshop that we're looking at now.

13:09.591 --> 13:11.374
The building is nice.

13:11.414 --> 13:12.716
It's particularly beautiful.

13:12.997 --> 13:13.337
I bet.

13:13.357 --> 13:13.878
Particularly beautiful.

13:14.900 --> 13:15.881
How long have you worked here?

13:16.162 --> 13:20.248
I've worked in the library since 1987, so I'm coming up with my 10-year sentence.

13:20.268 --> 13:20.669
Oh, good.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.574
That's a pretty nice place.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.159
So you work actually over at the... I work at the back of this building.

13:27.260 --> 13:27.660
Oh, I see.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.802
At the development office.

13:29.390 --> 13:32.613
We're in port-a-cabins at the back, which are very nice.

13:32.633 --> 13:38.119
It's a nice office I've worked in since I've been in the library.

13:38.399 --> 13:38.940
Very nice.

13:39.660 --> 13:41.182
Wonderful.

13:41.202 --> 13:47.068
So in here, the architecture continues to be the answer of the design.

13:47.628 --> 13:51.432
It's to encourage people when they get to the front door, they think they can't go into the last building.

13:51.933 --> 13:54.355
As far as if they get to the door, then that continues through.

13:54.876 --> 13:59.160
It actually changes when you get up the steps over there.

14:02.195 --> 14:07.746
Very nice.

14:10.211 --> 14:10.772
And it works.

14:12.896 --> 14:18.427
This is magnificent.

14:18.488 --> 14:21.233
When we were out from the piazza, this is your inflated area.

14:22.259 --> 14:39.981
From here, you can get to most areas.

14:40.282 --> 14:45.687
There's a place here where when you need to get a part to use the reading room to come straight from the front door.

14:45.707 --> 14:47.328
Inflammation is just in front of the room.

14:47.568 --> 14:49.530
If you need to get a part, etc, etc.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.732
Go to the room to the room to the room to the admission office.

14:51.752 --> 14:53.654
Go downstairs to the cloakroom area.

14:53.674 --> 14:56.076
We can hang some 800 coats down there.

14:58.078 --> 15:03.282
The exhibition galleries are just through to the doors here and the bookshop.

15:03.923 --> 15:08.567
The surfaces in here, all the white which you see is white Italian travertine marble.

15:09.543 --> 15:38.132
and all the woodwork that you see is white American oak came from the state because there wasn't enough in this country to provide the needs of the building come from renewable sources the only thing I do know is that the wood they've used in the French building apparently haven't come from renewable sources but that's one of the things I have been told but all our wood has come from renewable sources and when you go around have a look at the woodwork and you'll see there's no notch marks in any of the wood at all part of the design

15:38.450 --> 15:42.935
specifications, there's to be no notch marks.

15:43.196 --> 15:49.923
Here's the subject of the last hand built building.

15:50.084 --> 15:51.786
You'll just notice right the way round.

15:53.107 --> 16:00.576
So where the plastic is at the moment, behind there is the King's Library.

16:00.978 --> 16:11.287
And the reason the plastic is coming down, well I presume some things will be coming down later, that will reveal the six-storey glass tower of the King's Library.

16:11.307 --> 16:12.508
I can't wait to see that.

16:12.989 --> 16:21.376
And the King's Library is the Library of George III, given to George IV.

16:21.396 --> 16:24.679
It's a working library, it's a working collection within the library.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.943
The spines of the books are going to be facing outwards throughout the tower.

16:29.632 --> 16:41.486
and the shelving is movable, so you pull the shelves and the books slide back and there's a walkway around the outside, a member of staff can retrieve the books from within the glass tower.

16:41.506 --> 16:43.348
Will the tower only be facing one direction?

16:43.428 --> 16:44.570
It's facing all four directions.

16:44.590 --> 16:45.370
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:45.390 --> 16:47.193
That's like the Beinecke to a small degree.

16:49.095 --> 16:49.936
What's that?

16:49.956 --> 16:53.019
A lot.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.765
And the main... just up there.

16:58.522 --> 17:06.832
So that's going to be quite exciting, because it's going to be one of the things that marks us out as a working library, as opposed to being a museum to the book.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.815
That's not what we are.

17:09.835 --> 17:12.398
We are the working library of the United Kingdom.

17:13.860 --> 17:20.347
So on the large wall here, coming down between the two lines is going to be a tapestry.

17:22.269 --> 17:24.552
And that is seven metres by seven metres.

17:25.093 --> 17:28.056
And it's based on a painting by Tiptine.

17:28.475 --> 17:30.057
called If Not, Not.

17:30.938 --> 17:35.644
And it represents various themes of 20th century life.

17:36.065 --> 17:45.496
In one corner there's outfits, there's various literary figures, and it's supposed to be like a description of a train journey through the countryside.

17:45.797 --> 17:49.882
It's one of those pictures that people either love or they hate.

17:50.683 --> 17:53.346
I don't mind it, I think it's quite attractive.

17:53.366 --> 17:57.992
But to actually now see the photographs of the pastries being woven,

17:58.242 --> 18:01.028
It's still being made.

18:01.930 --> 18:11.070
There's only one loom large enough in this country, the tapestry, and it's being woven in Edinburgh.

18:11.320 --> 18:18.615
and we had a grant for that from the Art Council Luxury Fund.

18:18.795 --> 18:25.889
Hi James, I'm Nick Breswain, my wife Connie.

18:27.131 --> 18:29.937
This has been a terrific introduction for me.

18:29.917 --> 18:30.758
That's great.

18:30.878 --> 18:32.219
We've just got to the Passage Street.

18:32.319 --> 18:43.490
I have to tell you, I've just had that part of the reason I'm late is that my taxi driver turns out his mum lives in Oxford Street and has lived in this part of London for 90 years.

18:43.510 --> 18:44.130
90.

18:45.091 --> 18:52.638
And I'm trying to get a local history project together where we have the kids from the region to come and record memories of the place.

18:53.579 --> 18:57.683
And he's just told me that he's going to go and ask his mum to get photographs of what it looked like.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.805
He remembers cows and sheep

19:00.140 --> 19:10.000
and horses on this site, because they used to do all the distribution of food during the war from this site, by horse and car, because there's no fuel.

19:10.121 --> 19:13.187
Anyway, so there is a different reason.

19:13.488 --> 19:17.173
Just so you know, I'm taping this, okay?

19:17.193 --> 19:18.515
Everything will be held within it.

19:18.535 --> 19:19.536
There's no surprise.

19:19.637 --> 19:20.278
That's fine.

19:20.518 --> 19:21.760
That's fine.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.745
Well, I do apologize to them.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.787
Oh, come on.

19:26.907 --> 19:29.931
I'm thrilled that you're able to see us, frankly, at such short notice.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.233
Well, you will see also.

19:31.293 --> 19:32.995
You arrived at the moment.

19:33.356 --> 19:36.440
Has Mark explained to you?

19:36.460 --> 19:36.761
Hi.

19:37.221 --> 19:37.582
Hello.

19:37.842 --> 19:38.904
Good to see you.

19:38.924 --> 19:41.147
This is a great occasion, isn't it?

19:41.167 --> 19:41.267
Well,

19:42.057 --> 19:42.818
No, it is.

19:42.918 --> 19:47.225
No, come on, don't qualify it.

19:47.245 --> 19:51.492
And that's been conceived as an integral part of the construction of the building.

19:51.632 --> 19:55.638
It's not only there to look pretty, it's helped with the acoustics in the entrance hall as well.

19:56.079 --> 19:58.983
So that's one of the works of art.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.888
And the four busts are of whom?

20:02.122 --> 20:08.289
The four of the founding donors of the collection.

20:08.349 --> 20:10.631
In fact, I thought that's for them.

20:10.712 --> 20:16.238
Have you explained that the tapestry is just about to be cut off the loom?

20:16.518 --> 20:16.818
It is.

20:16.858 --> 20:20.743
It's being made in Scotland.

20:20.763 --> 20:22.124
Very, very close.

20:22.144 --> 20:22.985
This is so beautiful.

20:23.065 --> 20:23.906
Congratulations.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.509
It should be a great

20:26.793 --> 20:28.515
Pleasure to work here, I can imagine.

20:28.575 --> 20:32.681
Oh, I think we're all really looking forward to it.

20:32.701 --> 20:35.104
It's going to be terrific.

20:35.124 --> 20:37.066
I plan for the afternoon.

20:37.107 --> 20:38.689
I think we do the exhibition gallery.

20:38.709 --> 20:42.514
I think we can get through, can't we?

20:42.594 --> 20:46.238
Yes, I think we'll just... We'll have to come back out this way.

20:46.319 --> 20:48.602
We'll have to come out to the top there.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.963
Maybe I'll sit around.

20:49.983 --> 20:52.767
We'll go to Redwood.

20:53.320 --> 20:58.225
Can we walk around the back maybe?

20:58.245 --> 21:01.128
We'll cross us through and finish the auditorium.

21:01.188 --> 21:07.514
We're thrilled to really... Do you have a time where you need to... No, we're giving the whole day to this.

21:08.695 --> 21:10.817
Whatever your time is, we're fine.

21:11.798 --> 21:15.662
So we'll go through into the exhibition gallery.

21:16.002 --> 21:20.627
At some point, will we be able to get some photographs

21:21.282 --> 21:24.125
You know, for you, they don't have to be by us.

21:24.405 --> 21:28.089
Yes, no, but we do have photographs, yes, of all the buildings.

21:28.109 --> 21:38.619
And this is... You can't get into it, but we have got a large bookshop which faces out onto the front and which will be a mixture of our own publishing and others.

21:38.639 --> 21:46.186
It's meant to work as a fully-fledged, proper bookshop which can support both the readers but also our general visitors.

21:46.206 --> 21:47.928
So that's not a gift shop, per se.

21:47.968 --> 21:50.530
It'll also be a professional bookshop.

21:50.847 --> 21:59.615
We have a bookshop on our site already, and I'm very keen that it remains a bookshop primarily because that reflects the library's mission and role.

21:59.875 --> 22:16.371
And there will be some low-priced things that go with it, and we ourselves produce greetings cards based on the collection of gift books, of which I can see Mark holding one, which we produce for general audiences.

22:16.391 --> 22:19.774
And of course things like our CD-ons, because we produce

22:21.070 --> 22:34.101
technology which is a whole other area quite literally is the shop window for the library as well which is why it's important

22:34.655 --> 22:43.064
curving windows that you can just about see, which will be, as it were, the shop window for the library as well as a book selling space.

22:43.324 --> 22:50.292
Is there a virtual element to the library in terms of the virtual library, the library of the future, the digital library?

22:51.333 --> 22:57.540
We have, in various places, terminals where there can be either public or reader access.

22:57.773 --> 23:02.341
to either the catalogs or to individual items within.

23:02.742 --> 23:07.770
We'll have a look, you'll see in the gallery, it's one of our most exciting developments, there's something called Turning the Pages.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.696
We learned about that.

23:11.056 --> 23:15.023
You have something you can show us on that?

23:15.223 --> 23:15.544
Not yet.

23:15.564 --> 23:21.334
It isn't set up here, there's only a prototype, but it's a development that we've

23:21.719 --> 23:23.261
It sounds very exciting.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.286
We were talking about it in terms of the Lindisfarne Gospels, apparently.

23:26.346 --> 23:34.679
That's the one that... Well, the ones we've done so far are the Leonardo da Vinci sketchbook and the Diamond Future.

23:35.000 --> 23:43.373
And what we're exploring is how you can get back as close as you can to that sense of actually touching and turning the pages that using the technology can.

23:43.353 --> 23:54.205
The diamond suits we particularly were very pleased about because it was a scroll, and we found this way that you can actually, with a touchscreen version, as it were, unfold the scroll.

23:54.245 --> 23:57.869
Apparently it's still too sophisticated to put together as a CB1.

23:58.830 --> 24:05.698
It's a question of memory compression storage and still wanting the kind of quality.

24:05.982 --> 24:07.644
But yes, ultimately, that's the idea.

24:07.724 --> 24:08.425
Oh, we'll get there.

24:08.445 --> 24:09.966
Yeah, you'll get there.

24:10.126 --> 24:19.156
But one version that will be here in the galleries, which was where our thinking started, because when we put books on display, obviously all you see is one open.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.080
And that's a frustration for any visitor.

24:23.100 --> 24:28.405
And the idea originated with allowing you to see beyond that.

24:29.466 --> 24:31.348
So you might see all the

24:31.666 --> 24:34.750
Gospel pages and the carpet pages of Linda Swan Gospel.

24:34.770 --> 24:39.516
I think Alice said that you'll be doing about 24 pages, I guess, originally, not the whole book.

24:39.536 --> 24:41.379
Linda Swan will do about 30 pages.

24:41.399 --> 24:47.146
With the Swartz Hours, we've done already about 30 pages, and we'll do more.

24:47.206 --> 24:49.750
With the Leonardo sketchbook, again, we'll take samples.

24:49.770 --> 24:55.497
But the idea is that we'll develop scholarly programs beyond that, so that you can actually be able to see the whole of them.

24:55.612 --> 24:57.114
It's more than entertainment.

24:57.514 --> 24:59.256
Oh, it's not.

24:59.316 --> 25:01.037
I hope it is entertaining.

25:01.178 --> 25:07.484
If it's just selective, then it certainly can't have that much of a scholarly application of existence.

25:07.544 --> 25:22.659
Part of it is trying to... What we try to do in the galleries and for the public is to just open the door a little bit to the collections and to direct people to how they can find out more about then what happens, what goes on.

25:23.440 --> 25:23.560
Great.

25:23.928 --> 25:29.697
So no, it's always, I hope, educational as well as entertaining.

25:29.717 --> 25:32.862
Will there be a unit here also for scanning books?

25:32.942 --> 25:34.945
I mean, will that be incorporated in this?

25:34.965 --> 25:36.627
We won't scan in this area, no.

25:36.728 --> 25:38.450
Or we won't allow people to scan here.

25:38.530 --> 25:43.137
We're looking at how we scan all the reading ones.

25:44.219 --> 25:52.652
We run, obviously, at the moment, with conventional terms, we produce photocopies or photographs for readers of material they want to look at.

25:53.375 --> 25:59.822
We have to be a little cautious about how we handle scanning and how we handle handheld scanning.

26:00.502 --> 26:03.405
We are going to have a unit up there.

26:03.906 --> 26:05.467
I don't mean for the general public, by the way.

26:05.507 --> 26:10.472
I mean in terms of your own professional scanning your own material.

26:10.512 --> 26:11.073
Yes, of course.

26:11.534 --> 26:22.825
We have huge already microforming units and they will slowly convert as technology allows it to development of scanning and full text capture.

26:23.935 --> 26:39.597
We have a project where we're looking for commercial partners to work with us to help us develop the infrastructure to support that, because, of course, it's not so much just the scanning, but it's the ability to store, index, and then get access to the material.

26:39.617 --> 26:43.563
These are all the issues I'm dealing with in this book, which is fascinating.

26:43.884 --> 26:46.047
It's working through those issues.

26:46.107 --> 26:47.929
It is a library of the future.

26:47.949 --> 26:48.991
I hope so.

26:49.011 --> 26:50.533
It really is.

26:51.121 --> 27:02.120
that is full of the past, that is absolutely something facing on the future.

27:03.082 --> 27:05.406
Mark, go ahead.

27:05.426 --> 27:08.151
It's a slumbering giant, isn't it?

27:08.468 --> 27:11.234
There's no natural light coming in.

27:11.254 --> 27:17.727
This is like the end of the fall into the Exhibition of Gallows, which we have three.

27:18.408 --> 27:22.697
If we go along with the end, we'll look down into the largest of the three.

27:23.538 --> 27:40.348
If this area is planned, this is open somewhere where we can either serve guides or small items about the collections, or if we can admission to some of our temporary exhibitions, then we'll send tickets here.

27:40.328 --> 27:45.316
There's a backlit post with that, and they've put large post with that.

27:45.336 --> 27:57.737
And there'll be a post on this line here which might show a major item or a recent acquisition or a particular item if it's an anniversary or something that we want to bring out for the short term.

27:57.757 --> 27:59.900
This is striking the black in the eye.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.964
The surface is here, which I've put in stone on the floor.

28:02.044 --> 28:07.112
And this is an African wood, black stained Iroko, which has a very low acidic level.

28:07.970 --> 28:11.557
So all the wood that you see as well, sometimes I think it's a metal.

28:12.118 --> 28:15.745
I was just feeling it, and I was unsure if it was wood, to tell you the truth.

28:15.885 --> 28:16.627
That's actually right.

28:16.807 --> 28:29.792
The kind of building you want to feel, as you walk around, do you see certain areas and you just want to... Will these exhibition areas basically be the ones that are now in the main reading and the...

28:30.683 --> 28:59.425
approach and concept and perhaps as we go into each mark do you mind if i explain a little bit about what we're going to do in each um this one is the is going to combine its its functions it's the largest of the three galleries as you see its double height and it will have each summer a major temporary show um our first show is actually going to be a joint exhibition with the library of congress which which we call at the moment is a working title

28:59.793 --> 29:08.063
special relationship and it's about the relationship and migration backwards and forwards between our two countries and how they've influenced and informed each other.

29:08.864 --> 29:10.646
As cultures or as libraries?

29:10.666 --> 29:17.755
As cultures, primarily, but of course the libraries are the underlying source of all that information and that's the message that's there.

29:17.835 --> 29:22.240
So it will deal with cultural, political, social,

29:22.979 --> 29:28.333
legal issues and the way in which our two nations have related.

29:28.794 --> 29:38.440
But underneath it all is of course the message that it is only in libraries that you can keep a record of that range of historical information.

29:39.365 --> 29:42.170
And when are you planning to mount this exhibition?

29:42.190 --> 29:43.773
That exhibition will be in 1999.

29:43.993 --> 29:45.155
That's when my book comes out.

29:45.175 --> 29:46.057
Who's curating it?

29:46.077 --> 29:46.417
Do you know?

29:47.199 --> 29:49.843
Yes, I do, because I'm organizing the curatorial team.

29:49.863 --> 29:50.725
We have curators.

29:51.125 --> 29:56.054
We have quite large teams of curators at the moment on both sides of the Atlantic working together.

29:56.715 --> 29:58.318
And we've now had...

29:58.298 --> 30:02.764
three, I think, exchange visits back between each other as we refine the ideas.

30:02.804 --> 30:04.106
Who's working at the LC?

30:04.206 --> 30:05.808
Do you know what I'm going down to?

30:05.989 --> 30:13.179
The LC, well, the coordination is still, I think, through their exhibitions team, and Winston-Cab would be the person to start with.

30:14.140 --> 30:19.327
But there are about six key curators from each of their departments.

30:19.347 --> 30:24.154
It'd be nice for me to talk to both sides on that, and just to prove that there would be some

30:24.623 --> 30:28.087
interesting insights just about what they're trying to demonstrate.

30:29.268 --> 30:36.716
Well, we've developed on this side a series of themes, and we've worked through with them to agree those.

30:36.736 --> 30:50.310
We went back to the States, four of us, in September to refine the themes, and since then we've been looking at a kind of spine for the exhibition, which is a timeline which identifies key events that we want to draw.

30:51.522 --> 30:52.643
Political or?

30:53.184 --> 30:55.666
They may be political, they may be social, they may be cultural.

30:55.687 --> 31:01.453
We've not seen... Tell me the name of the exhibition again.

31:01.553 --> 31:05.477
The exhibition we're calling is a working title, A Special Relationship.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.638
A Special Relationship.

31:06.678 --> 31:08.600
There'll probably be a colon there, I'm sure.

31:08.981 --> 31:15.087
Well, I'm not even sure whether that'll be the title, because, you know, it's all in inverted commas.

31:15.248 --> 31:15.408
L-C-B-L.

31:15.428 --> 31:17.470
My book is coming out in 1999.

31:17.510 --> 31:18.671
It would be a graphic combination.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.213
That would be perfect to write.

31:21.678 --> 31:37.759
The 2000th century exhibition for example is one on a literary theme, it tends to be called a thousand years of English literature, or literature in English, or again working titles.

31:37.919 --> 31:46.690
The exhibition in 2001, the key exhibition is on the Nobel Prizes, which are the prizes when you're working with the Nobel Foundation.

31:47.682 --> 31:51.107
The one out of us in 2002 is our medieval scene.

31:52.349 --> 31:58.418
And we're trying to, in presenting our exhibition, explore all the areas of the collection.

31:58.438 --> 32:08.273
But then in between, there's a series of semi-paramount scenes that reflect areas of the collection and which relate, when we come to it, to what we're doing in the other two scenarios.

32:09.046 --> 32:35.125
So, for example, the first five themes that we open are, as we walk down, children's books, the story of writing, something on science and technology, but I've forgotten if it's a new title, images of the theme, and... That's okay.

32:35.145 --> 32:38.310
I'm curious... There are a series of themes, the art of the book.

32:38.932 --> 32:40.815
The Beowulfs, would that be here?

32:40.855 --> 32:43.299
The Beowulfs will actually be up in the Treasurer's Gallery.

32:43.319 --> 32:44.842
So that will be the Treasurer's Gallery.

32:44.862 --> 32:51.192
The Treasurer's Gallery will be taught long and hard of about over eight years.

32:51.873 --> 33:00.467
What do you do with a collection that's so diverse, where there are so many completely unrelated items, where there are such hard relationships with individuals?

33:00.565 --> 33:09.375
And the treasure's galleries and those is our only way really of handling it, where there are about 40 or 50 major items which will be always on display.

33:09.875 --> 33:22.389
And then around those will be groups of items from the collection which will explore some very broad, very, very broad streams of literature and media.

33:22.409 --> 33:25.052
But when you talk... I'm sorry, go ahead, not finished.

33:25.072 --> 33:25.712
No, no, no, that's fine.

33:25.732 --> 33:25.973
I'm sorry.

33:26.593 --> 33:30.117
Certainly...

33:30.603 --> 33:53.984
When you're saying completely unrelated themes... The individual items, for example, there is no intellectual relationship beyond their place in the library that we can find for, say, Magma Carter and the Winsfang Gospels and the Diamond Sutra.

33:54.905 --> 33:56.866
The Diamond Sutra is not British.

33:56.947 --> 33:59.749
What I was thinking, the treasure room probably would be

33:59.965 --> 34:02.649
related by the fact that they were at least British, right?

34:02.749 --> 34:11.904
No, no, no, because we are not, although we're the nationalized of Britain, our collections are international, and always have been, right from the beginning.

34:13.406 --> 34:16.291
The earliest foundational collections were not just British.

34:16.311 --> 34:17.933
That's right.

34:17.953 --> 34:20.978
So you can understand the difficulty then of making coherent

34:21.548 --> 34:39.085
gallery which is showing off the collection so we just have decided to give a little bit of shape to the scenes by giving a context to the individuality so here we begin I think with the classical and antique world and they move into the medieval period

34:39.284 --> 34:41.527
which allows us to show the illuminated manuscripts.

34:42.207 --> 34:55.623
We move into the Renaissance and the Golden Age, which allows us to talk about Shakespeare and the introduction of printing and some of the literary works, which carries on into the literary work into the 19th and 20th century.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.124
Magna Carta is here.

34:58.145 --> 34:58.966
Music is here.

34:59.046 --> 35:06.675
And so we've constructed a, I hope, comprehensible sequence of things happening.

35:07.364 --> 35:12.277
But I couldn't pretend to say that there was a coherence, except that they were all part of our collection.

35:12.398 --> 35:17.612
Is it understood that this is basically a permanent exhibition?

35:18.053 --> 35:18.514
Yes.

35:18.555 --> 35:20.580
These won't be revolving items, so to speak.

35:20.881 --> 35:25.265
There were 40 or 50 which were not moved, for a variety of reasons.

35:25.285 --> 35:32.852
I mean, some, by terms of the quest, but mostly because people will expect to see Magrakasha, they'll expect to see them in the spine gospels whenever they can.

35:33.532 --> 35:46.824
Other material will change, and it gives us an opportunity to show, and we have several thousand illuminated manuscripts, and so therefore we wouldn't want to show all the time just the sort of 20 or so that we could show in this space.

35:48.325 --> 35:50.247
And you have maybe...

35:50.598 --> 35:53.925
200, 300 that are just as beautiful as the last one.

35:53.945 --> 35:54.226
Absolutely.

35:54.406 --> 35:57.452
I mean, it sounds rather greedy, but that is the case.

35:57.492 --> 36:01.641
So this will allow for everyone to keep the permanent core and then build around it.

36:02.102 --> 36:04.146
But also, this is where we'll show turning the pages.

36:04.166 --> 36:05.890
There's a little room off here.

36:06.865 --> 36:13.132
And you can go in and have a look at digital images of items that we've seen and turn the pages.

36:13.152 --> 36:15.615
We decided not to put the technology in the gallery.

36:16.356 --> 36:22.442
The only possible exception to that will be sound, where we have the National Sound Collections, you know.

36:23.424 --> 36:27.508
And we feel that we need to somehow present a sound treasure.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.110
That'll be in here.

36:29.130 --> 36:33.615
And we're looking now at how we might introduce that into this gallery without

36:38.472 --> 36:43.778
presenting a contrast between the other things that are going on.

36:43.818 --> 36:47.602
We'll perhaps have a word about what's happening down below because we have something different.

36:49.023 --> 37:08.023
All the cases are fiber optic lit and can be individually conditioned so that you can actually maintain items in the conditions that their fabric requires, so if there is ivory or silver or other material that requires different conditioning within a case we can achieve it.

37:08.341 --> 37:10.786
and it's a cold fibrillate.

37:10.806 --> 37:16.417
We're introducing the lights, the lights will be higher than this, but most of the light will come from within the cases.

37:17.018 --> 37:26.596
But in addition, we're producing double-panelled engraved glass directional silage.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.422
So here is the sample.

37:29.442 --> 37:31.125
There will be a double-spin

37:31.105 --> 37:40.061
engraved glass panels with light flooding up in between, uplift, so that the lighting will actually show you where the broad directions are.

37:40.261 --> 37:42.805
You're moving from the classical world to the medical world.

37:43.486 --> 37:44.308
And it'll give you that.

37:44.328 --> 37:53.063
But if they themselves will be, we hope, rather beautiful, and in a sense works of art, but they have a very practical purpose, is that they'll bring more light into the space.

37:53.718 --> 37:59.045
Because we don't, although these are clearly items to revere, we don't want people to be put off.

37:59.345 --> 38:06.995
And if you walk into a dark room, quite a lot of others may feel intimidated.

38:07.015 --> 38:08.377
So we don't want people to be intimidated.

38:08.397 --> 38:12.603
We want to keep drawing them in and to provide opportunities for them to move on.

38:13.143 --> 38:22.536
My wife asked Mark a question a little bit earlier, and I think that you kind of anticipated it in a way where you suggested that this is an international library.

38:22.576 --> 38:23.657
And I wonder,

38:24.076 --> 38:29.304
Could you contrast the new British Library, say, with the new French National Library?

38:29.324 --> 38:31.988
Or is that going, reaching too far?

38:32.048 --> 38:41.942
Well, the French National Library does also have international collections, but probably not to the extent that we have.

38:41.962 --> 38:48.091
Their concentration has been on French material.

38:48.111 --> 38:53.239
So when I say that, they have wonderful collections that are international in scope, certainly early collections.

38:54.097 --> 39:02.851
But certainly the later collections are not, I would say, as international as ours are, so I wouldn't particularly want to make that kind of comparison.

39:02.871 --> 39:02.931
No.

39:02.951 --> 39:10.263
I'm just wondering in terms of a—I mean, it is coincidental that you both have brand new facilities opening at approximately the same time.

39:12.006 --> 39:16.493
Would you say that there's a philosophical difference or a similarity between the two?

39:16.928 --> 39:19.010
in terms of purpose?

39:19.030 --> 39:21.153
I think overall there are many similarities.

39:21.333 --> 39:28.100
I mean, we are each striving for that kind of universality that a national library seeks.

39:28.120 --> 39:42.936
The difference, I mean, there's a fundamental difference in that they are attempting to provide what we would call a public library service, and that one whole element of their new reading room at Tolbiac

39:43.321 --> 39:50.049
is for the public public library access.

39:50.069 --> 39:55.876
We're using a lot of new technology to bring surrogate material for a general audience.

39:55.896 --> 39:56.917
We don't aim to do that.

39:56.937 --> 40:00.401
There's a public library system well developed in the UK.

40:01.362 --> 40:04.706
Perhaps needing support now, but still very well developed in the UK.

40:04.726 --> 40:06.748
But this remains a research facility.

40:06.788 --> 40:09.031
Essentially a research facility.

40:09.411 --> 40:12.535
But what we recognize that our ownership

40:13.038 --> 40:25.950
of these major, major cultural items means that we owe, if you like, the taxpayer, the general public, the general interested person, as well as the researcher, the opportunity to have access.

40:25.970 --> 40:42.285
Hence the galleries and a whole lot of educational and associated events, which we think are an important part of owning and caring for a national collection.

40:42.535 --> 40:45.179
Well, it has to be, doesn't it, in this day and age?

40:45.199 --> 40:46.241
And I hope everything else.

40:46.622 --> 40:46.822
Yeah.

40:48.304 --> 40:54.875
In a way, I'm less worried about bullets than sort of liquid and chewing gum, and the bullets are hopefully occasional.

40:55.015 --> 40:56.557
They'll get them at the door, we hope.

40:56.778 --> 41:06.834
The chewing gum, the chewing gum, and I mean, at least in our galleries at the moment, one of my exhibition centers' first inquiries was, can we have concealed locks?

41:07.014 --> 41:09.538
Because in our cases in the British Museum,

41:10.025 --> 41:15.994
They're perpetually, not perpetually, but really quite often finding that people are stuck.

41:16.014 --> 41:23.484
Oh yeah, well it's quite malicious, isn't it?

41:27.951 --> 41:32.217
So these are probably for the optic fiber, these little curly things?

41:32.237 --> 41:34.260
Yeah, these things are the fiber optic.

41:34.510 --> 41:51.794
B, when we put up the door closed in quite such serried ranks as they are now, that they can move anywhere along this process, which means that wherever we put an item, we can focus and turn the heads and turn the lights and get the cold light onto the object itself.

41:52.315 --> 41:57.182
And of course, the beauty of having internal case lighting is that you don't get reflection from the glass.

41:57.202 --> 42:01.648
I mean, as you can see now already, we're getting reflection from the lights above.

42:02.472 --> 42:06.437
Internal lighting means that you have no reflection, you can look at the lighting itself.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.839
So these lights won't be on then?

42:08.300 --> 42:11.003
Well, we're changing the way these, we won't change them.

42:11.043 --> 42:14.688
The lights will be here, but they'll be rather differently focused.

42:14.708 --> 42:17.211
And so the concentration will be on the light here.

42:17.231 --> 42:20.396
And that will diffuse any reflection you can get from other lighting.

42:20.736 --> 42:27.585
And as I say, we're providing, through uplighting, at various points, extra ambient light.

42:28.038 --> 42:38.268
which doesn't affect the light on the surface of the book because for preservation reasons, I keep that down to about 50 to 75 left, which I think is about four to five candles.

42:38.288 --> 42:39.729
A lot of thought went into this.

42:40.210 --> 42:41.031
Oh, yes.

42:41.051 --> 42:42.332
Yes.

42:42.352 --> 42:48.398
Well, I've personally been working on this for... I don't think I even want to share it.

42:48.418 --> 42:49.979
Well, how long?

42:50.620 --> 42:57.066
Well, I took on the job, well, part of my job which included exhibitions in, I think, about 80...

42:57.502 --> 43:02.868
1987, and we really started working on this, the detail here then.

43:03.408 --> 43:07.953
But some work had already been done, but we were specifying the cases from that stage on.

43:07.974 --> 43:08.234
Wow.

43:08.454 --> 43:13.520
So it is now 10 years.

43:13.540 --> 43:16.223
Construction as a rule doesn't take that long, does it?

43:16.303 --> 43:16.603
No.

43:17.164 --> 43:19.947
We didn't expect it to take that long when we started.

43:19.967 --> 43:24.792
When was this originally supposed to be operational?

43:25.008 --> 43:39.605
The earliest date for this particular development on this site was I think probably 1991 was the first meeting date which then moved really quite quickly to 1993 and thereafter.

43:40.186 --> 43:54.002
Can I just tell you briefly, just down below here is another gallery which is just an empty square so nothing to see but there we've introduced something completely different which we've never done before which is a kind of hands-on

43:54.505 --> 44:00.432
display which is about the history of communication and the idea is that you walk into a space

44:01.019 --> 44:06.644
which begins to tell you about the introduction of language and text and talks about scripts and moves into the Middle Ages.

44:06.704 --> 44:11.808
We reconstruct, in fact, a woman scribe, Christine de Pisa.

44:12.069 --> 44:12.789
Oh, she's famous.

44:12.849 --> 44:13.710
Of course she's famous.

44:13.750 --> 44:17.974
But she's a woman which is quite nice because everybody thinks a scribe is being nice and scriptural.

44:18.034 --> 44:19.275
I have several books about her.

44:19.315 --> 44:22.678
And Christine, we have a small model of where she worked.

44:22.698 --> 44:30.064
But we also have her materials there so that people can actually touch and relate to what she was doing, what she was working with.

44:30.584 --> 44:38.753
And then we introduced printing, we have reconstructed the 18th century wooden common press, which will be operating on it.

44:39.434 --> 44:39.874
I can't wait.

44:39.894 --> 44:40.815
When will this be opened?

44:41.116 --> 44:42.397
April next year.

44:42.537 --> 44:43.819
We'll come back next year.

44:43.839 --> 44:46.702
We'll still be working on the book, so we'll be able to get this in.

44:46.722 --> 44:50.966
And it ends up with a computer-based hypothesis.

44:51.107 --> 44:53.870
This is lovely.

44:54.010 --> 44:55.191
You actually see that.

44:55.492 --> 44:58.679
Isn't that wonderful?

44:58.739 --> 45:00.022
So tell me what we're looking at, Mark.

45:00.042 --> 45:02.126
This is the King's Library.

45:03.229 --> 45:06.896
If we go further over, you'll be able to see the four stories.

45:07.919 --> 45:11.286
As I said earlier, the way it faces all four sides of the building.

45:11.306 --> 45:12.428
Oh, this is beautiful.

45:12.549 --> 45:13.230
And this is it.

45:13.700 --> 45:16.002
You're excited, I can tell.

45:16.022 --> 45:18.405
I've never seen it through a door before.

45:18.845 --> 45:19.866
My favorite bit.

45:20.286 --> 45:20.807
My favorite bit.

45:20.847 --> 45:21.928
Can we get up?

45:23.009 --> 45:23.790
Let's go to the next.

45:24.330 --> 45:27.874
Because one of the flagging little effects is you put black marble down here.

45:28.214 --> 45:34.561
And when you get a bath, you have the sense that this whole tower rises literally out from the basement.

45:34.581 --> 45:35.562
Masses of storage.

45:35.642 --> 45:37.543
It looks as though it goes up forever.

45:37.704 --> 45:42.188
It's a bit like a... I can't wait to see this.

45:42.910 --> 45:44.953
The shelving, what is the shelving?

45:44.973 --> 45:46.275
The shelving is metal of some sort?

45:46.295 --> 45:47.778
It's metal, yes.

45:48.278 --> 45:52.325
It does actually, it moves.

45:52.966 --> 45:57.373
All of the books here have to be retrievable to be looked at in the reading room.

45:57.393 --> 46:08.230
So this is a functional, this is a totally functional... If we go through, I think there'll probably be some of this plastic we can nip through to the side.

46:08.250 --> 46:10.133
I'm sorry Martha, I'll just capture a bit.

46:11.328 --> 46:13.813
Well, they're having a reception now, sir, isn't it?

46:13.994 --> 46:18.383
Well, it's Sandy Wilson, who is the author, at 75th birthday.

46:18.603 --> 46:18.784
Uh-huh.

46:19.064 --> 46:23.093
And it's the first... This is actually an auspicious day, right?

46:23.292 --> 46:35.246
It's changed up here.

46:35.387 --> 46:51.426
We're now through in a reader-only area between 3D Green and 8.

46:52.013 --> 46:58.203
So if somebody will need a pass to get through here?

46:59.104 --> 47:00.466
It's like using the tube gate.

47:00.486 --> 47:02.129
But it's a reader's pass.

47:05.194 --> 47:12.165
So when I applied for one of these five years ago, if I had one of these now, I could come in and read.

47:12.145 --> 47:19.093
automated system are actually about three to four years ago, so your past may not be one of those.

47:19.113 --> 47:20.820
No, I don't think it's current, actually.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.527
No, but when it's reissued,

47:23.080 --> 47:27.205
it will be able to open these gates, and so it will allow you through.

47:27.225 --> 47:29.428
But if I don't have one of those, I can't come through.

47:29.448 --> 47:32.792
You have to come to the Reader Admissions Office, which is down in the corner, and have it reissued for you.

47:32.812 --> 47:34.574
But the general public can't come up here.

47:34.735 --> 47:36.377
No, that's the dividing line.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.601
The public can walk all the way around at this level and the lower level.

47:40.582 --> 47:50.134
That, unfortunately, is the center of the book, which is a kind of place where we can give the public information about book-based events and things that are happening.

47:50.114 --> 47:54.359
I'm looking at some general inquiry terminals there, where you can access the internet.

47:54.379 --> 47:58.084
This is the centre of the book 10 from the Library of Congress.

47:58.104 --> 47:58.725
John Cole.

47:58.745 --> 48:00.046
John is an old friend of mine.

48:00.066 --> 48:03.030
I gave a talk at the Library of Congress.

48:03.110 --> 48:06.594
Oh my goodness me.

48:06.714 --> 48:09.838
I did tell you about the choir, didn't I?

48:09.858 --> 48:12.021
I told Marie, she didn't know Sandy was telling me.

48:12.963 --> 48:26.703
Have you ever been to see the Thomas Fisher Airbook Roman?

48:27.745 --> 48:29.668
I know Richard very well.

48:29.768 --> 48:31.370
Richard was my host two weeks ago.

48:31.511 --> 48:37.840
I gave a talk up there and I just found so dramatic and almost

48:39.473 --> 48:55.232
It's magnificent, it really is.

48:55.492 --> 49:03.962
You have to sort of see it with the King's Library volumes inside.

49:04.921 --> 49:14.032
The reason I mention Thomas Fisher is this kind of suggests what they did up there, with the galleries that go around the outside, and the Beinecke somewhat like this.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.113
Yes, the Beinecke is very similar.

49:15.674 --> 49:17.396
This was much more Beinecke modeled, I think.

49:17.416 --> 49:18.838
That's right, because this is a core.

49:19.318 --> 49:21.081
Thomas Fisher goes around the outside.

49:21.121 --> 49:23.063
This is wonderful.

49:25.786 --> 49:27.368
And how many volumes in King's Library?

49:27.388 --> 49:29.170
Must be 17,000 or whatever?

49:29.991 --> 49:30.832
Something like that.

49:30.912 --> 49:31.693
I should know the numbers.

49:31.713 --> 49:32.194
Hello, Clyde.

49:33.676 --> 49:48.817
And the beauty of the King's Library is that, you know, some people might argue that you should move it more or less precisely the way it was, but when it went into the British Library, it was never precisely the way it was when the King had it.

49:49.918 --> 49:54.845
The whole point about the library is that it doesn't space.

49:54.865 --> 49:55.386
That's right.

49:57.549 --> 50:00.072
I'm sorry, Mark, did I take you in the sewer?

50:02.296 --> 50:27.831
is this american wood really is this american well i'm very proud this beautiful wood i hope you don't feel yes i'm not sure whether it's definitely to be proud but it's also because it's a renewable resource in the states which it isn't in the uk and unlike with your technology now who have used unreadable hardware we felt quite strongly

50:29.077 --> 50:32.582
It's quite correct, shall we say.

50:33.984 --> 50:39.251
One of my favourite stories is about this, which shows the history of the brief.

50:41.034 --> 50:47.743
The history of the brief for the building goes back to the late 1970s, at which time

50:48.398 --> 50:54.447
We needed to specify a typing room, which was a quiet place where people who had typewriters could go and work.

50:54.467 --> 50:55.308
Oh, that's funny.

50:55.328 --> 50:56.830
So here is the typing room.

50:56.991 --> 50:58.313
Nobody has typewriters anymore.

50:58.333 --> 51:00.696
Nobody has typewriters anymore.

51:00.716 --> 51:04.462
My belief is that that will be the place where people without computers go.

51:06.004 --> 51:07.386
To be quiet.

51:07.872 --> 51:10.214
So why did they keep it then?

51:10.254 --> 51:13.457
Well, because the brief became fixed in about 1980.

51:13.517 --> 51:18.041
And of course, if you think back, 1980, no internet.

51:18.061 --> 51:20.242
CD-ROM was introduced in 1981.

51:21.283 --> 51:26.448
Brief was fixed in order, the government said, for this contract to go through, you can't keep changing.

51:26.468 --> 51:27.308
You can't fool with the brief.

51:27.849 --> 51:30.171
So what do you do with computers and the internet then?

51:30.231 --> 51:34.334
Well, every single... We've been able to upgrade the space.

51:34.394 --> 51:35.215
So we have ports here.

51:35.595 --> 51:37.457
So each...

51:37.825 --> 51:45.267
Whether we will allow people to bring in computers and use their own computers to access the internet is a big question.

51:45.307 --> 51:46.370
We haven't quite decided.

51:46.932 --> 51:52.408
But in theory, there is an individual PowerPoint and ADP point.

51:53.148 --> 51:54.831
for the linkage.

51:54.851 --> 51:59.521
It's whether our local network can support us and quite how we manage it.

51:59.541 --> 52:01.285
A little printer here too, probably.

52:01.325 --> 52:02.327
Yes, we probably could.

52:02.347 --> 52:06.435
That would be a question probably of noise and disturbance as well.

52:06.555 --> 52:10.363
It's all a question of working through what's going to be most comfortable with people doing.

52:10.597 --> 52:14.108
And we call this the, this is the reading room?

52:15.011 --> 52:17.278
This is one of the main readings.

52:17.298 --> 52:19.365
This will be ultimately the red book's reading room.

52:19.385 --> 52:23.779
It will open a humanities reading room in the first phase.

52:23.962 --> 52:26.025
Well, you're a lot of readers, aren't you?

52:26.085 --> 52:29.449
We will get a lot of readers.

52:29.469 --> 52:36.798
What we know, in fact, one of the worries is that we haven't got enough, you know, even criticized for not having enough space.

52:36.819 --> 52:39.662
That's a question of funding, not of choice.

52:39.742 --> 52:44.568
David said this morning that I talked to Dr. John Simmons yesterday.

52:44.588 --> 52:46.831
I thought it was quite an interesting one.

52:46.851 --> 52:48.073
And he gave us a chair.

52:48.574 --> 52:51.497
I think we should ask you both to test drive the chair.

52:51.517 --> 52:51.918
Okay, good.

52:52.599 --> 52:53.580
To see what you think.

52:58.049 --> 53:02.477
And I need a new chair, Karne, because I know where they got these.

53:06.924 --> 53:07.365
These are all leather.

53:07.385 --> 53:07.746
Oh, this is great.

53:07.766 --> 53:07.866
Nice.

53:07.886 --> 53:08.687
One of the tables actually wrote a book.

53:08.707 --> 53:09.108
Excellent.

53:10.210 --> 53:11.112
Made in Britain.

53:11.132 --> 53:13.155
There's always in Britain, too.

53:13.675 --> 53:15.538
They were specially designed for the time.

53:15.918 --> 53:18.282
Do we call them British Library chairs, do you think?

53:18.302 --> 53:19.404
Do you think they have a name?

53:19.424 --> 53:20.645
I think we'll probably sell them now.

53:20.665 --> 53:21.727
I hadn't thought about that.

53:22.007 --> 53:23.029
You could sell them, you know.

53:23.109 --> 53:23.870
I could sell them.

53:23.910 --> 53:26.955
You bet.

53:27.175 --> 53:28.177
I shall have to do it, obviously.

53:28.197 --> 53:33.304
You should really put a little seal on the back, and it's guaranteed, you know, British Library.

53:33.324 --> 53:40.375
And then all the famous names to start on it, so it's not just a British Library chair, but this is who shall we have.

53:40.709 --> 53:41.731
Michael Holroyd.

53:41.751 --> 53:42.913
This is Michael High's chair.

53:43.314 --> 53:44.676
This is Margaret Gravel's chair.

53:44.696 --> 53:45.418
Margaret Gravel's chair.

53:45.558 --> 53:47.101
This is Hal Pinter's chair.

53:47.121 --> 53:47.461
That's right.

53:47.482 --> 53:49.505
This is Lodi Antonia Frazier's chair.

53:49.525 --> 53:49.746
Exactly.

53:50.627 --> 53:51.830
This is Lodi Lively's chair.

53:51.850 --> 53:53.312
This is Phyllis James's chair.

53:53.332 --> 53:54.334
Yeah, that will happen.

53:54.354 --> 53:55.917
And that's the typing room over there.

53:55.937 --> 53:57.520
Is that what we formally call it?

53:57.719 --> 53:59.481
Well, it's been changed.

53:59.521 --> 54:01.203
It was the type of room until recently.

54:01.223 --> 54:08.270
I notice now it's called the study room, which I think is a very... It may carry a certain cachet, you know.

54:08.310 --> 54:11.294
There may be people who want to be in there because it is isolated.

54:12.295 --> 54:13.156
You might find that.

54:14.117 --> 54:21.004
Well, the way the current reading rooms work is that there is a whole unwritten process of laws.

54:21.024 --> 54:21.705
Oh, absolutely.

54:22.546 --> 54:24.388
Especially at the French library, for instance.

54:24.408 --> 54:27.591
You have to be somebody to sit in the middle, you know.

54:27.807 --> 54:37.019
Yes, I mean, with us, it's probably, where you sit in the Ryan Reading Room, very fundamentally where you sit in the North Library, which is our, our Brooks Room.

54:37.039 --> 54:41.545
And you have to be very careful that you don't sit in some of the seats.

54:41.565 --> 54:47.413
And you have the TV cameras, I think, conspicuously placed, which is important.

54:48.375 --> 54:50.698
People should be aware that they're there.

54:50.718 --> 54:53.241
We had a very, we had a couple of very

54:54.014 --> 54:56.497
unpleasant cases, but which were brought to court.

54:56.517 --> 54:57.939
We insisted they were brought to court.

54:57.959 --> 55:06.989
In fact, in both cases, the people you had stolen from the collections got prison sentences.

55:07.009 --> 55:11.955
And we then put out a display in the rare books room of the damage that had been done.

55:12.035 --> 55:15.499
We put it on display in cases just to remind people because

55:17.217 --> 55:27.031
But it's important that at Cornell, which is a brand new facility, they have the cameras right where you can see them, and then they also have the monitors, so you can actually see what they're looking at in the reading room.

55:28.573 --> 55:33.340
It's important as a deterrent, because it is very difficult still to detect.

55:33.360 --> 55:39.529
And what is that design of...?

55:39.762 --> 55:42.464
I think this guy has a Turkish wine rack.

55:45.167 --> 55:45.327
Not bad.

55:45.347 --> 55:47.248
Hold a lot of bottles, wouldn't it?

55:47.268 --> 55:51.152
But throughout the building, there's plenty of little features.

55:51.232 --> 55:57.357
There's the gruel on the front of the region missions office as well.

55:57.377 --> 56:00.900
And just little features throughout the building.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.602
That one is just more interesting, though.

56:02.622 --> 56:05.464
There's quite a lot of Japanese and things that you saw in the galleries, and you can see that bit more interesting.

56:05.484 --> 56:09.027
He's found himself very pleased with the way he's moved from that floor.

56:09.698 --> 56:25.016
I love that it's very plain.

56:25.076 --> 56:26.899
It's white, it's oak.

56:27.459 --> 56:30.122
Down below it's black and it's white.

56:30.383 --> 56:31.684
Outside it's the brick.

56:32.085 --> 56:35.088
Just very nice, consistent.

56:35.108 --> 56:39.013
The question I was going to ask is what Dr. Simmons said yesterday with David

56:39.500 --> 56:44.828
You said that you add one and a half miles of books a year, and David said, I think it's more than that.

56:44.868 --> 56:48.213
It might be two, two and a half miles of books per year.

56:48.693 --> 56:50.095
What are you equipped to handle here?

56:50.416 --> 56:51.618
When were you run out of space?

56:52.038 --> 56:52.779
Have you projected that?

56:52.880 --> 57:08.983
Well, we have projected it, and what we're already doing is trying to identify what we would call low-use material and recognize that that'll have to move off-site to Boston Sparks, to our Yorkshire, our store of space, because

57:09.301 --> 57:19.112
we haven't got the size of building that we'd originally wanted, that the funding was reduced, and therefore we haven't got the room for expansion, we'd hoped.

57:19.132 --> 57:30.746
But what we'll aim to do is to use Boston Spire as the prime site, so we won't get into the situation we were in, that we're in now, in fact, where we're trying to draw from 14 or 15 different sites around London.

57:30.786 --> 57:32.208
There's 17, actually, I think.

57:32.228 --> 57:38.515
Well, there's 17 sites that feed into one, leading into something like 14 different

57:39.372 --> 57:44.380
So what is the capacity here then for printed books and other materials?

57:44.620 --> 57:45.922
The total number.

57:46.182 --> 57:47.605
Approximately.

57:47.905 --> 57:49.888
How many linear meters?

57:50.088 --> 57:53.013
Is it 375 million?

57:53.433 --> 57:54.795
275 miles.

57:55.316 --> 57:56.899
Yeah.

57:56.999 --> 58:01.806
So just under 300 miles of linear meters.

58:01.826 --> 58:02.207
Whatever.

58:03.809 --> 58:04.771
Some other books.

58:04.791 --> 58:07.835
We have a set of statistics which we could happily send you.

58:08.216 --> 58:08.316
Okay.

58:08.549 --> 58:10.652
I may query you on this.

58:11.013 --> 58:15.060
Helen is wonderful, by the way, so she seems she's answered every query that I've had.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.442
Oh, good, good.

58:16.462 --> 58:24.976
In the science reading room, I was out at the water with my friends, because they've been on holiday, and they can canoed 18 kilometres.

58:24.996 --> 58:26.879
I said, oh, that's Hyde Park Corner to Heathrow.

58:26.899 --> 58:35.653
And I said, how do you know that I've followed 18 kilometres of open access shelving in the science reading room, and it's Hyde Park Corner to Heathrow?

58:35.836 --> 58:39.664
You have to know these comparative statistics.

58:39.784 --> 58:43.070
Yeah, because the total length distance is almost from London to Edinburgh.

58:43.571 --> 58:44.714
Is that right?

58:48.601 --> 58:56.477
We'll go out into the book supply area.
