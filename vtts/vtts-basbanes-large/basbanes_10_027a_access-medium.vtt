WEBVTT

00:04.958 --> 00:07.701
You said we just got a $7 million gift?

00:07.941 --> 00:13.708
Yes, we got a $7 million gift in 1999 from a person who was a $100-a-year donor.

00:16.551 --> 00:16.832
Wow.

00:17.052 --> 00:17.913
Can you tell me who he is?

00:18.514 --> 00:18.854
She is?

00:19.955 --> 00:21.017
This person is still alive?

00:21.557 --> 00:28.165
Well, it's a little bit of a complicated story, because I'll tell you the story off the record, and then we'll see what we can use.

00:31.349 --> 00:33.171
I don't have to think about his name.

00:33.231 --> 00:34.392
His wife's name is well-known.

00:34.878 --> 00:36.380
I mean, is known to me.

00:37.421 --> 00:43.007
This person was a bachelor and gave us $100 a year as a friend of the library.

00:44.269 --> 00:48.494
His will stipulated that if he predeceased... Wow.

00:49.475 --> 00:50.736
There was this fellow and his sister.

00:50.957 --> 00:51.257
Good story.

00:52.098 --> 00:58.305
The will stipulated that if his sister died first, his entire estate would come to the New York Public Library.

00:59.586 --> 01:04.412
It further stipulated that if he predeceased his sister,

01:04.865 --> 01:10.711
The library would get $20,000, and the rest would go to the sister.

01:10.731 --> 01:12.032
That is indeed what happened.

01:12.052 --> 01:12.953
So now he's dead?

01:13.113 --> 01:13.914
So then he died.

01:13.934 --> 01:14.895
I can get his name.

01:14.915 --> 01:17.037
Yeah, but I can give you all that stuff.

01:17.077 --> 01:24.464
So then the sister died shortly after the brother died.

01:24.504 --> 01:30.750
So an attorney representing the sister's husband, Dr. Adolf Berger.

01:31.631 --> 01:32.712
That's the name of the guy who died?

01:33.012 --> 01:34.253
No.

01:34.493 --> 01:42.381
Adolf Berger is the husband of Margaret Liebman Berger.

01:42.881 --> 01:43.822
B-E-R-G-E-R?

01:43.842 --> 01:44.683
B-E-R-G-E-R.

01:45.864 --> 01:52.090
And so Margaret Liebman's husband's brother's name was something Liebman.

01:52.430 --> 01:53.371
Charles, I think.

01:53.391 --> 01:53.772
Charles Liebman.

01:53.832 --> 01:54.693
He's the benefactor.

01:54.753 --> 01:55.573
He's the benefactor.

01:55.774 --> 01:57.575
Well, there are many benefactors, it turns out.

01:57.715 --> 02:00.058
So Liebman, right?

02:00.098 --> 02:00.818
Liebman.

02:00.838 --> 02:02.140
L-E-I-B-M-A-N?

02:02.180 --> 02:02.580
L-E-I-B-M-A-N.

02:03.607 --> 02:05.349
Yes.

02:06.610 --> 02:19.562
So the attorney representing the widower of his sister wrote to me asking, saying that he'd like to talk to me about a possible gift to the library.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.587
So I said, sure, I'd love to see you.

02:24.667 --> 02:29.371
And the development, this is off the record, the development people here said, don't get your hopes up.

02:29.591 --> 02:32.314
You know, the person involved gave us $100.

02:32.615 --> 02:35.579
a year, and so you're going to be lucky to get $100,000.

02:35.639 --> 02:47.173
And I said, well, look, this letter comes from, you know, a white shoe law firm, and an attorney at this level wouldn't ask to see the president if it were just $100,000.

02:47.193 --> 02:48.775
You know, send me a letter.

02:49.436 --> 02:56.545
So I saw the attorney, and Dr. Berger wanted to know he didn't need the money.

02:57.666 --> 03:02.132
He wanted to know what we would do with it if, instead of accepting it, he simply

03:03.023 --> 03:14.094
and there's a technical legal term, sort of declined to accept the inheritance himself from his late brother-in-law by his late wife, and in fact directed it to us.

03:14.995 --> 03:26.906
And the way the law works, you've got sort of a window of opportunity that might last a year, a specified number of months, in which this kind of a decision had to be made, and the clock was ticking, and he had to make up his mind within a week.

03:27.847 --> 03:30.550
So I said to the attorney, how much money is involved?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.717
And the attorney said, $7 million.

03:33.797 --> 03:38.563
Excuse my grief.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.826
How recent is this, by the way?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.389
This was within the last 12 months, I guess.

03:43.409 --> 03:43.670
Wow.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.233
So, 99?

03:46.433 --> 03:47.474
I believe it was in 99.

03:47.755 --> 03:49.136
Might have been 98, 98, 99.

03:49.817 --> 03:53.061
So, it turns out that Charles Liebman loved manuscripts.

03:55.015 --> 03:59.421
And so we allocated $4 million to endow the Manuscript Division here.

04:00.202 --> 04:00.422
Wow.

04:00.442 --> 04:03.065
You're going to call it FDM, name it?

04:03.986 --> 04:05.108
No, but we did name.

04:05.168 --> 04:15.301
And then $3 million we used to endow the Scholars and Writers Center that we've created.

04:15.361 --> 04:16.082
Oh, I see.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.704
So some of this money came from you.

04:17.724 --> 04:22.710
So the public meeting room there where the lectures to the public will be presented is called...

04:23.247 --> 04:25.751
The Margaret Liebman Burger Forum.

04:25.911 --> 04:26.372
Margaret?

04:26.652 --> 04:27.193
Liebman.

04:27.473 --> 04:28.234
L-E-I-B-M-A-N.

04:28.254 --> 04:29.116
L-E-I-B-M-A-N.

04:29.136 --> 04:29.797
How come Margaret?

04:30.077 --> 04:30.638
Burger.

04:30.658 --> 04:31.539
Burger Forum.

04:33.382 --> 04:37.949
Because the money had come to Margaret, and it was Margaret's husband.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.573
So was this a departure from the will?

04:41.795 --> 04:42.035
No.

04:42.496 --> 04:44.959
Because he did pre-decease.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.422
He did pre-decease, yes.

04:46.722 --> 04:52.090
But the sole survivor of the three of them, Dr. Burger, said, well, you know, why shouldn't I...

04:52.306 --> 04:57.373
abide by my late brother-in-law's initial wishes.

04:57.433 --> 05:01.378
Most people wouldn't take $7 million unless Dr. Berger didn't need it.

05:01.398 --> 05:06.105
Well, Dr. Berger was also, I assume, inheriting from his wife and had his own assets.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.307
And Dr. Berger at that point was in a nursing home.

05:08.568 --> 05:08.948
I see.

05:09.008 --> 05:15.757
He and his wife, his wife was more ill than he, and so he couldn't provide for her at home.

05:15.778 --> 05:16.599
That's a nice story.

05:16.619 --> 05:18.281
So they had both checked into a nursing home.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.122
Is this written anywhere?

05:19.482 --> 05:19.643
No.

05:19.683 --> 05:20.484
That's a nice story.

05:20.504 --> 05:21.385
And he just died.

05:21.685 --> 05:25.009
It's a nice, it's a lovely story.

05:25.049 --> 05:25.329
I love it.

05:25.349 --> 05:25.609
I love it.

05:25.629 --> 05:28.352
And the lawyer was here for tea the day before yesterday, and we showed him the room.

05:28.392 --> 05:31.396
How can I get some material on this to document?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.538
Catherine Dunn, who's our senior vice president.

05:33.798 --> 05:38.063
And would you, I know you're leaving, but can I tell her that we spoke, or would you?

05:38.083 --> 05:38.343
Yeah, sure.

05:38.383 --> 05:41.567
And would you express that it would be all right for her to share some?

05:41.587 --> 05:42.187
Yeah, yeah.

05:42.207 --> 05:42.968
Catherine Dunn.

05:43.248 --> 05:43.749
The UNN.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.951
And the secretary's outside can give you her phone.

05:45.971 --> 05:46.352
Okay, good.

05:46.372 --> 05:46.772
Terrific.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.334
That's a wonderful story.

05:49.597 --> 05:51.820
And I'd love to find out something about Ratke.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.484
Would you also be the one to give me some information about him?

05:54.504 --> 05:58.530
I'm thinking, you see, of using an epigraph for every chapter.

05:59.771 --> 06:03.577
And I hadn't, until I walked in today, and I said, there's my epigraph for this.

06:03.997 --> 06:08.924
It doesn't always have to be Voltaire or Borges.

06:09.024 --> 06:10.947
It can be somebody like

06:11.382 --> 06:12.083
That's very nice.

06:12.123 --> 06:12.784
That's very nice.

06:13.084 --> 06:15.867
I thought that would just be because this is what a public library is.

06:15.887 --> 06:16.087
Right.

06:16.107 --> 06:20.612
Since we last spoke, I got the famous $15 million gift to do the reading room.

06:20.632 --> 06:21.413
Have you seen the reading room?

06:21.573 --> 06:22.915
I haven't.

06:22.935 --> 06:24.697
I just spent a half an hour up there now.

06:24.857 --> 06:25.377
It's gorgeous.

06:25.397 --> 06:27.059
To keep copying stuff up there.

06:27.079 --> 06:27.760
It's my legacy.

06:28.180 --> 06:28.861
Isn't it exquisite?

06:29.061 --> 06:29.902
It's magnificent.

06:29.922 --> 06:30.763
It's absolutely magnificent.

06:30.783 --> 06:32.625
So that was a gift from a tripte and her husband.

06:32.645 --> 06:34.347
And anyone we can name?

06:34.507 --> 06:34.928
Oh, sure.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.811
Sandra Priest Rose and Frederick Phineas Rose.

06:37.891 --> 06:39.853
We have this much.

06:40.306 --> 06:42.369
press clippings on that.

06:42.449 --> 06:44.914
And again, Catherine would be the person for this stuff.

06:45.935 --> 06:46.095
Yep.

06:46.115 --> 06:49.080
Somebody else would just send me an $8 million personal check.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.025
Easy smile.

06:52.346 --> 06:56.292
Let the tape show, but Paul is smiling.

06:56.312 --> 06:59.197
But she doesn't want her name banished about it.

06:59.237 --> 06:59.577
That's fine.

06:59.597 --> 06:59.918
That's fine.

06:59.938 --> 07:05.487
That's to create a whole new orientation center for the public here in this building.

07:06.378 --> 07:08.721
Okay, which brings us to something.

07:08.741 --> 07:13.947
The public library here, the New York Public Library in particular, seems to be, you're not a university.

07:14.948 --> 07:16.029
You're a library.

07:16.590 --> 07:21.736
And yet you are doing things beyond the transmission and the preservation of knowledge.

07:22.337 --> 07:23.879
You're doing things of scholars.

07:23.899 --> 07:29.165
You're doing things that would normally be in the purview of a... Well, yes and no.

07:29.205 --> 07:31.367
Well, I think it's wonderful.

07:31.488 --> 07:33.049
Perhaps you could explain to me what you're doing.

07:33.069 --> 07:33.550
Well, most...

07:33.817 --> 07:35.159
But my time is really limited.

07:35.179 --> 07:35.279
Okay.

07:35.299 --> 07:37.042
Well, how much time do we have, by the way?

07:37.062 --> 07:39.646
We have five minutes.

07:39.666 --> 07:40.087
Just five?

07:40.307 --> 07:40.668
Yeah.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.512
We have two important questions to ask you before we go.

07:44.013 --> 07:48.921
Most independent libraries in America have centers for advanced scholarship.

07:49.161 --> 07:58.035
The American Antiquarium, the Folger, the Getty.

07:58.055 --> 07:59.858
Yeah, but they're specialized research libraries.

08:00.766 --> 08:04.811
They're not really public libraries, even though we know the special circumstances.

08:04.831 --> 08:17.305
Yes, but this is a very, very high-end, intensely rich, vast collection that obviously is intended to serve the needs of the scholar community as well as other communities.

08:17.325 --> 08:23.072
So it was Bob Darnton, the great historian of the book, who suggested... Which is one of the two questions that I have here involves Bob Darnton, so go through my head.

08:23.092 --> 08:27.837
Well, what pleases me about some of the work that I've been able to do here is that

08:28.171 --> 08:41.408
While I'm no longer in a university with faculty around me, I was able to bring into the library's family two of the great, great scholars whose work I've always admired, Peter Gay and Robert Darnton.

08:42.309 --> 08:44.232
And, you know, it was Darnton.

08:44.252 --> 08:47.055
When I got here, I realized that we had no academics on the board.

08:48.477 --> 08:49.158
So I pointed that out.

08:49.178 --> 08:50.460
I've interviewed Bob for this book.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.962
Yeah, I pointed that out to the chairman.

08:52.022 --> 08:52.682
He said, who do you want?

08:52.743 --> 08:53.383
I said, Darnton.

08:53.403 --> 08:54.685
So Darnton came on.

08:55.103 --> 08:59.988
Darnton gave me the idea of creating a center for scholars, and then the donor said you should make them scholars and writers.

09:00.088 --> 09:01.550
And I said, of course, why didn't I think of that?

09:01.610 --> 09:02.751
So it's now scholars and writers.

09:03.832 --> 09:13.021
And then hired Peter to be his first director, which was a wonderful thing.

09:13.422 --> 09:16.485
What was I going to tell you?

09:17.386 --> 09:17.826
That's OK.

09:17.846 --> 09:19.888
Let me ask my question.

09:19.908 --> 09:20.489
Oh, go ahead.

09:20.509 --> 09:20.689
No, no.

09:22.508 --> 09:41.652
What we realize now is that as we put all this very, very high-end information technology into these facilities, and as we ourselves move very aggressively into the field of the electronic dispersal of information, the New Public Library, when I met you, we didn't even have a website, I believe.

09:41.672 --> 09:48.381
Last month, in one month alone, we had 17 million hits on the library's website, with readers coming from 161 different countries.

09:49.154 --> 10:17.338
and so you can track that yeah and you can even track those i can give you the list okay easter island andorra i didn't realize that you could i can give you the list of all the different countries of where we just oh you should see it we'll get that to the captain yeah it's uh yeah 135 thousand electron view sessions

10:18.145 --> 10:40.778
So as we make these places more sophisticated in terms of information technology, we realize increasingly that we have a responsibility to train the public on how to use these libraries, how to exploit them skillfully, efficiently, effectively.

10:42.985 --> 10:46.369
And we are building now classrooms in this library, in this building.

10:46.469 --> 10:58.664
We're building a new building, yes, with classrooms in it and a whole new orientation center in which to train readers, both those who read in traditional kinds of ways.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.506
Are we talking about the general public?

11:00.746 --> 11:01.747
Are we talking about students?

11:01.767 --> 11:03.629
Are we talking about scholars?

11:03.870 --> 11:04.811
How do you define a reader?

11:05.251 --> 11:05.632
Anybody.

11:05.672 --> 11:07.234
All of them.

11:07.594 --> 11:11.659
If you come in here, we should be able to tell you how the collections are organized,

11:11.943 --> 11:12.804
What's where?

11:12.824 --> 11:14.125
Are you going to have a classroom for that?

11:14.165 --> 11:14.366
Yes.

11:15.627 --> 11:17.169
So you'll have sessions that are there.

11:17.209 --> 11:24.998
Well, we have four classrooms at Sybil, and to date we've trained, in terms of IT, about 30,000 people.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.400
There's an immense demand for it.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.301
How to use the library.

11:29.142 --> 11:29.943
That's right.

11:30.023 --> 11:30.944
And how to use the library.

11:30.964 --> 11:34.368
And what we do is we convert librarians into teachers, instructors.

11:35.389 --> 11:35.630
Yeah.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.412
Well, we can tell you a lot about this.

11:37.452 --> 11:38.693
I mean, this is a big deal for us.

11:39.247 --> 11:49.259
And we have a whole, we got a million dollars from the Hearst Foundation to do a three-year advanced management training program for all the librarians and the research libraries.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.861
And we hired a guy to do that.

11:51.042 --> 11:51.983
He's really quite wonderful.

11:52.483 --> 12:05.980
So the, you know, the kind of advance that we're making at the New York Public is taking exceedingly seriously the need to reconceptualize part of the work of a professional librarian with training of the public.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.903
as a key element in that reconceptualization.

12:09.084 --> 12:13.909
And we are building facilities in which we can... The facilities were here or elsewhere?

12:14.329 --> 12:18.253
Here, in the branches, but especially in the research libraries.

12:19.435 --> 12:26.943
We're putting in a training center in the new Library for the Performing Arts that we're renovating.

12:26.963 --> 12:32.509
And we're putting in a substantial commitment to a training center here at Fifth Avenue.

12:32.529 --> 12:35.352
So quickly, because you do have to go, let me do three things.

12:35.372 --> 12:36.473
The first time we spoke

12:36.875 --> 12:38.097
And we've touched on this.

12:38.498 --> 12:42.224
You said, do you realize how much money I have to raise every week to keep this place going?

12:42.244 --> 12:44.929
And I think the figure you said was half a million dollars a week.

12:44.949 --> 12:46.712
It's now $600,000.

12:46.732 --> 12:47.634
So it's now $600,000.

12:47.654 --> 12:48.335
So that's the $2,000.

12:48.676 --> 12:49.277
That's number one.

12:49.297 --> 12:58.613
Number two, in my interview with Bob Darnton, he mentioned that, of course, being a trustee, that this is springing out of the Zinman thing and the...

12:59.167 --> 13:28.465
periodicals which were microfilmed and the books that were guillotined and are rather embarrassing i'm not getting into this in a great deal but i have to deal with it and bob did say that you have developed a plan or a no very comprehensive policy and is this something that i can see that i can have or that i could i don't know uh but i'll find out and i'd like but even i'd like to know what the policy of the library is now on that matter very conservative

13:30.233 --> 13:31.575
It's very conservative.

13:31.915 --> 13:35.720
But my colleague, Bill Walker, who runs the research library, has put this together.

13:36.301 --> 13:38.244
Should I call Bill on this?

13:38.264 --> 13:38.364
Yeah.

13:38.904 --> 13:40.126
Why don't you do that next week?

13:40.366 --> 13:42.269
He's in an ARL meeting in Chicago.

13:42.409 --> 13:44.772
But I think, Bill, I think we have to address ourselves.

13:44.972 --> 13:45.173
Sure.

13:45.213 --> 13:45.814
Because Bob did.

13:46.174 --> 13:47.656
Oh, it's a major revision.

13:47.736 --> 13:52.783
And I think it will be to your best interest to let me have it, too.

13:52.803 --> 13:55.887
Because I think you do recognize the error of your ways.

13:56.087 --> 13:58.350
Not your ways, but certainly.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.462
Maybe things were done that shouldn't have been done.

14:02.024 --> 14:03.005
It's easy in hindsight.

14:03.025 --> 14:04.648
You did preserve the information, of course.

14:05.969 --> 14:11.716
There were different attitudes towards managing collections 20 years ago than are the case now.

14:13.198 --> 14:17.984
And the artifact is taken on a different kind of context.

14:18.405 --> 14:26.835
The whole concept of the artifact is taken on a different... The artifact is container, it's not just

14:27.068 --> 14:33.635
It's not just, I mean, the argument tends to be what's more important, the information it carries or the artifacts?

14:33.675 --> 14:38.160
Well, it's a, it's a... Of course, Bob Darton, this is one of his major concerns.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.922
It's a substantially complicated issue.

14:40.123 --> 14:43.666
I mean, one has to look at the financial condition of this library in the 1970s.

14:45.609 --> 14:46.750
It was not what it is today.

14:47.831 --> 14:55.860
And one, there were fiscal capacity issues, whether or not the library had the resources to keep.

14:56.093 --> 14:59.036
contain everything that it owned or that was coming to the collections.

14:59.917 --> 15:01.338
There were preservation issues.

15:02.219 --> 15:14.690
There were attitudes that are developing, and you can talk to Pat Batten, who's the best spokesperson, about preservation microfilming and so on and so forth.

15:16.191 --> 15:25.560
So what this administration did, when it had the opportunity to look at

15:26.283 --> 15:37.901
practices and to consider revising those practices was to do what we consider to be the best thing given our own attitude today towards collections at our own capacity.

15:38.221 --> 15:45.472
Our economic or financial capacity now is vastly superior night and day from what it was 20 years ago, 25 years ago.

15:47.395 --> 15:49.739
And I absolutely understand the relevance of that.

15:49.799 --> 15:51.401
That makes perfect sense.

15:51.421 --> 15:51.702
Sure.

15:51.822 --> 15:55.227
And I'm a friend here, so you have to understand that I'm not

15:56.523 --> 16:02.470
You have to understand where I'm coming from, but I would also be criticized if I didn't address the subject.

16:03.011 --> 16:04.433
It's not our issue alone.

16:05.434 --> 16:05.714
No, no.

16:05.874 --> 16:06.876
I have a whole chapter on it.

16:07.016 --> 16:09.659
Have you heard of the James J. Hill Library out in St.

16:09.799 --> 16:11.141
Paul, Minnesota?

16:11.942 --> 16:12.963
They got rid of 150,000 books.

16:13.023 --> 16:15.707
This is an issue for all research libraries.

16:15.727 --> 16:21.754
This is not an issue, but it's particular to the New York Public Library at all.

16:22.612 --> 16:23.954
You just had more material.

16:23.974 --> 16:26.477
I mean, you had a larger critical mass of material, too.

16:26.517 --> 16:30.282
You also had things which were degrading, and we were talking here about pamphlets.

16:30.322 --> 16:37.172
I don't know if we had a larger critical mass in other great research libraries and university-based research libraries.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.754
We might not have.

16:38.774 --> 16:40.576
But again, funds are critical.

16:40.757 --> 16:44.722
You are at a university, and you don't have an endowment, per se.

16:44.762 --> 16:46.965
You certainly didn't have one in the 70s.

16:47.080 --> 16:59.995
And then finally, a small thing, we've heard about the discussion going on at the Library of Congress, the debate as to whether or not they will shelve by height, and then you guys have about 40% of, you've been doing it for a long time, is that right?

17:00.015 --> 17:02.939
We've been doing it since this building opened.

17:02.959 --> 17:05.522
And it hasn't, what's your take on it?

17:05.602 --> 17:06.363
Has it been a successful?

17:06.483 --> 17:12.310
Of course, you don't have open stacks, so people don't go in and browse according to subject classifications by office.

17:12.330 --> 17:16.395
No, we will continue to shelve by height, even in the off-site facility.

17:16.949 --> 17:18.050
Well, outside makes sense.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.393
That's where it absolutely makes sense.

17:20.413 --> 17:22.255
The Harvard model is entirely by size.

17:22.295 --> 17:23.237
You eliminate the air.

17:23.297 --> 17:24.138
That's the whole point.

17:24.438 --> 17:30.866
But is your evaluation that it's been a successful, no big problem?

17:30.926 --> 17:33.008
I mean, you don't understand what all the excitement's about?

17:33.669 --> 17:38.615
Why is all this criticism coming from within the Library of Congress as to whether or not they might?

17:38.635 --> 17:41.218
And this is not a browsable library, so I don't understand it myself.

17:41.298 --> 17:42.600
I went to the new German library.

17:42.620 --> 17:43.942
It's entirely done.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.083
Every book is

17:45.316 --> 17:47.439
catalog by the time it comes in in the year.

17:47.619 --> 17:49.301
That's the 001.

17:49.341 --> 17:51.404
That's the first book that comes in in 2001.

17:51.464 --> 17:52.445
That's how it shows.

17:52.786 --> 17:58.974
No, I must admit, maybe I shouldn't, but I'm oblivious to the controversy of the Library of Congress.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.576
It's not something... Good.

18:00.636 --> 18:04.080
I like the quote, too.

18:04.101 --> 18:04.962
That's it.

18:04.982 --> 18:06.323
I wish we had more time.

18:06.343 --> 18:06.784
Yeah, I do, too.
