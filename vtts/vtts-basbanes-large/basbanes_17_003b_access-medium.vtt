00:02.343 --> 00:06.830
Cheap and pocket, is it still cheap or is this appreciated, Alan?

00:06.890 --> 00:07.371
It depends.

00:07.471 --> 00:10.416
Do you have a printing date on it by any chance?

00:10.436 --> 00:11.678
There isn't a printing date.

00:12.420 --> 00:15.945
Some of the engravings say they were engraved for C. Cook in 1797.

00:15.965 --> 00:18.469
Others say 1799.

00:18.750 --> 00:18.850
Okay.

00:18.830 --> 00:21.954
Well, it precedes the true cheap edition.

00:22.554 --> 00:33.187
Interestingly enough, when railroad stations were being built in the 1850s is when the first paperbacks or the first cheap editions really were made popular in England.

00:33.447 --> 00:36.230
They were the first paperback or cheap edition racks.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.474
And that's when you actually see the word cheap edition on almost every book.

00:39.634 --> 00:40.956
It was a traveler's library.

00:40.936 --> 00:49.694
What you have is probably a traveler's library that was printed in the 1780s to 90s to the early 1800s.

00:50.115 --> 00:57.831
And what it is is a series of which you have a volume which comprises two poets that could have been as long as 40 or 50 volumes.

00:57.811 --> 01:02.195
dependent upon what the publisher decided to do or the printer decided to do to put out.

01:02.675 --> 01:09.902
As a general rule of thumb, these books sell for no more than $5 to $15, depending on the condition of the leather.

01:10.222 --> 01:16.227
And a full set would be proportionate to that, $10 a volume, as a general sense.

01:16.588 --> 01:27.177
I'm sure that is what it is, because it even says here in the back, they describe it as each volume from its convenient size forms an agreeable traveling companion, adapted for amusement at the fireside, et cetera, et cetera.

01:27.157 --> 01:48.220
an interesting point is the torwich editions which were another series of books cheap editions bernard torwich um actually published some of the first editions of travel books which now are worth two to three to four hundred dollars a piece but they came out as cheap editions in the 1830s we have one book in stock right now by amelia edwards which is um um

01:48.200 --> 01:51.005
on untrodden peaks and something else.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.388
I can't remember the exact title.

01:52.408 --> 01:55.254
She also rode 1,000 miles up the Nile.

01:55.554 --> 02:00.604
And we have the tourways edition, which has original photographs of the people that she saw in the Alps.

02:00.664 --> 02:03.289
And we have that price at $150.

02:03.269 --> 02:13.240
Another individual group of books that came out is the Harper Brothers series in the 1830s, which were the equivalent of the first American pocketbooks, but they're cloth-bound.

02:13.260 --> 02:21.649
And they actually have Baker, the Travels Up to the Niazza Falls, which is the first book on the African exploration.

02:21.729 --> 02:24.532
That book sells for $300, and that was a cheap edition.

02:24.552 --> 02:25.593
So cheap isn't always cheap.

02:25.893 --> 02:27.875
Well, not in book collecting, it isn't.

02:27.935 --> 02:29.657
So don't get put off because you just see cheap.

02:29.697 --> 02:32.821
But in your case, unfortunately, cheap is inexpensive.

02:32.841 --> 02:33.141
It's expensive.

02:33.762 --> 02:34.747
Thanks, Sally.

02:34.908 --> 02:35.511
Well, thank you.

02:35.631 --> 02:35.973
Thank you.

02:35.993 --> 02:41.038
That's Sally calling the Book Guys, 1-800-828-BOOK.

02:41.339 --> 02:42.440
That's the number you call.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.642
You'll get an answering machine.

02:43.662 --> 02:57.037
We just want to tell you what happens, and no matter who's there answering, sometimes it's a live person, but quite often, because we're recording when you're out of the house, when you're calling, we'll call you back and set you up for the radio show.

02:57.057 --> 03:03.744
That's the way it works in a lot of programs today, and we want to get you at home, comfortable, like, well, like Dean is.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.567
He's sitting in his home, and he's got something for us.

03:06.888 --> 03:08.289
Dean, welcome to the Book Guys.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.330
Well, thank you, Book Guys.

03:09.671 --> 03:10.492
I'm glad to be here.

03:10.512 --> 03:10.772
Good.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.538
I've got a couple of interesting books that are signed by Barry Goldwater.

03:15.599 --> 03:18.642
One is his book that's called People and Places.

03:19.143 --> 03:20.304
It's a first edition.

03:20.324 --> 03:24.949
1,000 copies have been printed on special paper or special bound.

03:24.989 --> 03:26.530
Each copy contains an original photograph.

03:26.771 --> 03:30.154
This is number 650, signed by Barry Goldwater.

03:31.095 --> 03:40.084
And then I have a book by Olaf Wehorst, who's a southwestern painter you may be familiar with, who has since died.

03:40.570 --> 03:44.834
This book is signed by Barry Goldwater and Olaf Wehorst as well.

03:45.775 --> 03:52.722
It has an original sketch in the front by Mr. Wehorst.

03:53.003 --> 03:54.404
Barry Goldwater did a show.

03:54.444 --> 04:01.351
He was a big collector of his artwork, I believe, and had a show somewhere either in Washington or in the southwest at one point.

04:01.952 --> 04:05.295
And I think he helped him in his work.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.896
profession.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.718
I mean, it was not a mentor.

04:08.738 --> 04:09.900
What's the word I'm looking for here, Mike?

04:10.120 --> 04:11.401
He was his mentor.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.382
Mentor, right.

04:13.924 --> 04:19.530
The first Goldwater book is probably the only book signed by Goldwater that actually is worth something because it's the limited edition.

04:19.950 --> 04:29.460
There are so many books out there that are signed by Goldwater since he's still alive that an average book signed by him would only be worth $15 to $20, depending on the book.

04:29.440 --> 04:36.807
The book you have is a little bit better because of the limitation, and I would say that on the market now it sells for between $75 to $125.

04:37.888 --> 04:51.402
The other book with the original sketch, I'm not familiar with the artist's work as far as his resale value, but I could just assume that considering that it's double signed with an original sketch.

04:51.422 --> 04:57.608
Is it an original sketch or is it a printed piece that's signed by the artist?

04:58.010 --> 04:59.673
It's actually an original sketch.

05:00.094 --> 05:00.995
In the book itself?

05:01.116 --> 05:02.538
I actually have two copies of the book.

05:02.558 --> 05:03.079
It's interesting.

05:03.119 --> 05:04.722
And they're both different sketches.

05:04.902 --> 05:05.103
Right.

05:05.984 --> 05:06.926
One's 100, number 127.

05:07.227 --> 05:08.229
Another one's 79.

05:08.409 --> 05:08.910
That's interesting.

05:08.930 --> 05:16.544
So he, in other words, made a limited edition book and in each book wrote a different or illustrated the book with a different sketch?

05:16.764 --> 05:17.305
That's correct.

05:17.325 --> 05:17.605
Wow.

05:17.766 --> 05:18.267
That's correct.

05:18.347 --> 05:21.432
And then Barry Goldwater has written a forward in the book.

05:21.633 --> 05:21.773
Mm-hmm.

05:22.057 --> 05:25.523
and there's a reason why his name is on there, and then the author of the book, William Reed.

05:25.883 --> 05:30.511
Well, I'll tell you quite frankly, I'd have to do some more research on this to give you an accurate idea of the value.

05:30.671 --> 05:38.243
I'm really interested in finding it out, because I've very rarely heard of an artist who actually would do a different illustration for a limited edition.

05:38.223 --> 05:44.413
Usually what they do is issue a limited edition with possibly a print numbered of one of 150 signed.

05:44.714 --> 05:59.979
And then to enhance the book, like I have a friend who does children's illustrations, who always illustrates the books for my kids and taking one of the illustrations from the book and then just doing a little, you know, capsulated version of it, which is an extra value to the book.

05:59.999 --> 06:04.146
But I've never heard of an artist actually going out and doing a different illustration per book.

06:04.126 --> 06:13.980
Alan, because this is a southwestern artist and because Barry Goldwater is based in Arizona, would this book possibly be worth more in Arizona than here on the East Coast?

06:14.060 --> 06:22.692
Oh, there's no question that geographically books have a difference in value, and people are going to be more prone to collect it in the area that the book is from.

06:22.672 --> 06:33.164
It's one of the tenets of appraising that actually when we do a certified appraisal that we can take in geographical location as a way to increase the value, i.e.

06:33.184 --> 06:39.952
a collection on books about Montana will sell for more because they're more desirable than they would be in New York City or Florida.

06:40.293 --> 06:44.157
So we can actually affix a value a little bit higher or higher.

06:44.322 --> 06:49.187
on a general rule, proportionately higher than you would in outside the geographic area.

06:49.707 --> 06:57.275
I would like to actually find out more about this book, and if you could call the 1-800 number after the show, I'd like to do some research to give you a price on that.

06:57.315 --> 07:01.199
I feel very uncomfortable just doing a guess on the air.

07:01.639 --> 07:02.140
Absolutely.

07:02.260 --> 07:02.720
That's fine.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.461
I'll be glad to do so.

07:03.481 --> 07:12.490
And you brought up an interesting point about the value of books, obviously, increasing when you have prominent political figures sign them and have some others by...

07:12.706 --> 07:14.509
They were signed by different presidents.

07:14.529 --> 07:17.113
And I'm wondering, are certain presidents more valuable?

07:17.133 --> 07:18.295
I guess the ones that aren't alive.

07:18.315 --> 07:19.076
Well, yeah.

07:19.116 --> 07:23.824
The best president you want to get is William Henry Harrison while he was in office, which was all of one month.

07:25.527 --> 07:26.989
Seriously, this sounds funny.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.695
But, you know, signatures are valuable proportionate to their scarcity.

07:30.795 --> 07:31.997
And as far as...

07:31.977 --> 07:46.919
People in political, you know, presidents or senators, et cetera, the two most valuable signatures that I know of are William Henry Harrison in office, or if you were collecting signers of Declaration of Independence, Button Gwinnett, who was a signer from Georgia.

07:47.139 --> 07:49.382
There's only five known signatures that he has.

07:49.422 --> 07:51.145
They sell for $300,000 or more.

07:51.826 --> 07:54.930
So, you know, presidents are valuable.

07:55.298 --> 07:59.304
I have a book by Dwight Eisenhower that is signed, Mandate for Change.

07:59.344 --> 08:04.252
Mandate for Change sells for anywhere from $300 to $600, depending if it's a limited edition or not.

08:05.234 --> 08:10.782
I saw four copies of it at the Boston Book Fair, ranging in price from $400 to $650.

08:10.842 --> 08:11.904
There you go.

08:12.184 --> 08:13.146
How about the Nixon books?

08:13.166 --> 08:13.847
Which ones?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.731
Well, I've got Six Crises and The Memoirs of Richard.

08:16.751 --> 08:21.897
Well, Six Crises, be very careful of, because he was notorious for using his auto pen on that book.

08:22.358 --> 08:25.521
And that's the one book that very rarely is signed in hand.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.544
If you have an inscription, then you have a better chance.

08:28.145 --> 08:29.186
Well, it's signed to my parents.

08:29.627 --> 08:30.668
Is it signed to them?

08:30.688 --> 08:32.430
I mean, does it say to Mr. and Mrs.?

08:32.690 --> 08:35.534
Then, obviously, it's very hard to put an auto pen like that.

08:35.794 --> 08:42.923
That book would sign, if it was a first edition, for a minimum of $300, because that's one of the more desirable Nixon books.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.414
Very, very interesting.

08:44.434 --> 08:45.476
Thanks, Dean, for calling us.

08:45.536 --> 08:46.197
Thank you, gentlemen.

08:46.217 --> 08:46.497
Thanks.

08:46.698 --> 08:47.038
Bye-bye.

08:47.058 --> 08:47.619
Bye-bye.

08:47.639 --> 08:50.303
Alan mentioned the number 1-800-828-BOOK.

08:50.323 --> 08:54.911
That's the way you get in contact with the book guys and become part of the radio show.

08:55.572 --> 09:00.319
You, who have heard the show now for several minutes, understand the way it works.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.544
You ask about your books, and Alan ends up who knows where.

09:03.524 --> 09:08.014
into the short life of William Henry Harrison as a president.

09:08.496 --> 09:09.758
We don't know where we're going to end up.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.583
It depends on your books and your calls.

09:11.603 --> 09:15.311
So call us right now at 1-800-828-BOOK.

09:15.371 --> 09:18.178
The number is answered 24 hours a day.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.824
Let's go to New York City.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.928
Tom, welcome to the book, guys.

09:23.268 --> 09:23.569
Hi.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.894
I have a collection of a dozen New York City directories.

09:27.736 --> 09:35.588
They're from the mid-19th century, 1851, 1852, and they span right up until, well, 1909, published by Trowes.

09:35.788 --> 09:36.069
Right.

09:36.449 --> 09:39.574
And I have three of them that have maps inside them.

09:39.594 --> 09:40.155
Right.

09:40.175 --> 09:42.499
They, as you know, were printed on very cheap paper.

09:42.980 --> 09:47.988
They're in a variety of conditions, some of them in better conditions than others.

09:48.008 --> 09:48.128
Right.

09:48.395 --> 09:56.307
and the same thing with the maps, but I am a genealogist, and they are very, very, I mean, they really are key to doing family history in New York.

09:56.327 --> 09:57.068
There's no question.

09:57.749 --> 10:01.194
Yeah, and I was just wondering what the value was.

10:01.274 --> 10:03.377
Okay, this is a wonderful area.

10:03.778 --> 10:18.199
About 12 or 15 years ago, when I had first really gotten into book collecting, I got a phone call from a local institution here who had 6,000 to 12,000 city directories, and I became an instantaneous expert on city directories.

10:18.179 --> 10:22.506
So I think I know more about city directories than the average person.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.069
They're great.

10:24.590 --> 10:28.456
Obviously, the earlier the city directory is for that city, the more valuable it is.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.682
Like in Washington, the first city directory is 1821 or 1822.

10:32.664 --> 10:40.918
And that sells, if you can find a copy of it in its original printing, when they now have a facsimile edition, it sells for about $2,000.

10:41.258 --> 10:42.921
Right.

10:42.901 --> 10:47.006
I had a city directory from San Francisco from 1851.

10:47.306 --> 10:50.510
You talk about having a wonderful piece.

10:50.630 --> 10:52.473
I didn't even price it.

10:52.493 --> 10:55.436
I just waited for people to call me up and tell me how much they would pay for it.

10:55.897 --> 10:58.720
But the ones that you have are very collectible.

10:58.780 --> 11:06.630
They sell for a minimum, and I'm saying this as a minimum because I haven't seen the condition of them, $75 a piece.

11:07.551 --> 11:10.174
I would imagine that some of the mid-1800s

11:10.154 --> 11:18.608
depending upon the engravings or the maps or the grids that you might have in there showing the areas, would sell for $200 to $300 now.

11:19.529 --> 11:23.516
The interesting thing is early phone books have become highly collectible.

11:23.536 --> 11:35.976
I had a phone book from Honolulu from 1897 or something that somebody offered me $400, which I didn't know what it was worth, but that basically made me think twice before selling it because I got that kind of an offer.

11:35.956 --> 11:40.222
Tom, since you're a genealogist, why would you want to sell these valuable resources?

11:40.262 --> 11:41.444
Well, I don't want to sell them.

11:41.504 --> 11:56.003
I had bought them at a shop that specializes in New York City material called New York Bound at Rockefeller Center, and the woman that owns the shop and runs the shop was, I guess that she had gotten a large collection of them.

11:56.104 --> 12:04.495
She had a lot of repeats, and she really did want to just sell them, and she gave them to me for a very, very good price, and

12:04.475 --> 12:15.092
Now, as you may know, all of these directories are available on microfilm in major libraries, but to actually have the hard copy in your hand is a whole different experience, as you know.

12:15.112 --> 12:21.943
Well, you know, the interesting thing about it is that, as you say, they're on microfilm, but there is such a feeling of history.

12:21.923 --> 12:33.790
When you see these in their original state and realize that people actually use these in their daily perusals of towns, I mean, the three cities that have the most city directors, obviously, are Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.

12:33.810 --> 12:37.198
So you're going to get larger print runs, but that doesn't mean that they're inexpensive.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.260
It's interesting.

12:38.280 --> 12:42.128
The 1909 one, it has the price was stamped right inside.

12:42.168 --> 12:43.150
They were not cheap at the time.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.174
They were $10.

12:45.414 --> 12:48.501
In 1909, $10 was quite a bit to pay for it.

12:48.521 --> 12:50.645
It took a lot of money to put one of those together.

12:50.926 --> 12:51.166
Right.

12:51.186 --> 12:54.192
Most of the time, there were law offices that had them.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.039
Whatever.

12:55.139 --> 12:57.403
I mean, the average person did not have a New York City directory.

12:57.423 --> 13:01.351
They had to go scare it up if they wanted to look up somebody in it.

13:01.651 --> 13:06.380
But they are, from a genealogical point of view, they're very, very exciting.

13:06.961 --> 13:07.682
It is history.

13:08.023 --> 13:09.486
It's on very cheap paper.

13:09.506 --> 13:10.427
I will say that.

13:10.508 --> 13:15.577
And actually, people that have bought them in very, very good condition is almost at a very, very high price.

13:15.617 --> 13:17.260
You almost scratch your head because...

13:17.510 --> 13:20.557
It's like the very old telephone books.

13:20.577 --> 13:24.105
You only use them a few times, and they begin to really start to fall apart.

13:24.185 --> 13:26.931
Tom, we thank you very much for your call to The Book Guys.

13:27.031 --> 13:28.735
We're The Book Guys.

14:00.355 --> 14:02.438
We're the Book Guys in Washington, D.C.

14:02.498 --> 14:04.540
We're talking used and rare books.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.064
We've had an interesting collection so far this program.

14:07.104 --> 14:09.227
Let's go to Boston to see what Jay's got for us.

14:09.247 --> 14:09.507
Jay?

14:10.008 --> 14:10.749
Gentlemen, good evening.

14:11.049 --> 14:11.169
Hi.

14:11.870 --> 14:16.696
I have a two-volume set of Philadelphia history.

14:16.716 --> 14:21.843
We go from Washington, New York, to Philadelphia, familiarly known as Watson's Annals.

14:21.943 --> 14:25.087
It was called the Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania in the olden time.

14:25.167 --> 14:25.348
Right.

14:26.749 --> 14:28.692
I guess half leather with sort of turkey hair.

14:29.093 --> 14:31.857
dark turkey marbled paper.

14:32.418 --> 14:34.981
I've never heard that expression in all my years of book selling.

14:35.562 --> 14:37.464
Dark turkey?

14:37.845 --> 14:44.154
I remember that from my museum days, that that's what this kind of outside paper looks like.

14:44.434 --> 14:46.016
But this is an edition dated 1857.

14:46.116 --> 14:49.942
I guess the first edition was about 10 or 12 years ahead of that.

14:50.002 --> 14:54.628
But it's illustrated with engravings and was sort of a

14:54.794 --> 14:59.802
A standby Philadelphia history in lots of households that I remember growing up.

14:59.822 --> 15:00.944
Watson's is a hard sell.

15:01.365 --> 15:03.168
It's a very popular book.

15:03.328 --> 15:06.854
It is pretty available in most used bookstores.

15:07.194 --> 15:12.523
You tend to go into any bookstore that handles Americana, and you'll always see a set of Watson's.

15:12.543 --> 15:15.047
I think we have two in stock in our rare book room.

15:15.027 --> 15:16.530
And, I mean, it's not that they're bad books.

15:16.570 --> 15:23.383
They must have published 400,000 sets of them over a period of time, and most of them have been retained.

15:23.964 --> 15:27.931
You're telling me that my children's college education is not in my hands.

15:27.971 --> 15:28.893
No, hopefully.

15:29.134 --> 15:30.977
Not unless they go to Philadelphia.

15:30.957 --> 15:35.063
Or, I mean, maybe a preschool week you might have, you know.

15:35.103 --> 15:38.308
But you're right, it's not going to put the kids through school.

15:39.329 --> 15:47.701
I would imagine that if you have a half-weather set, we would price it just to keep the price inflated in the store for about $75 to $125.

15:47.741 --> 15:52.668
But we would probably take half of that if somebody made an offer, okay?

15:52.708 --> 15:57.235
It's just one of those books that just is not a drudge on the market, just it's out there.

15:57.367 --> 16:02.334
That, I guess, explains why it was so common growing up.

16:02.354 --> 16:02.554
Right.

16:02.835 --> 16:03.616
No question.

16:03.956 --> 16:12.308
Do you have a chance to think a little bit about a Philadelphia-published set of Dickens, a Lippincott set dated 1882?

16:12.468 --> 16:17.075
That's a late edition.

16:17.255 --> 16:17.516
Yeah.

16:17.536 --> 16:20.380
That's definitely been in the public domain, or it's a boot.

16:20.500 --> 16:20.640
Mm-hmm.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.405
Excuse me, it's a boot?

16:22.425 --> 16:24.993
A bootleg, you know, or, you know, a pirate, you know.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.942
It's not, it looks, it's a green buckroom, I guess.

16:27.962 --> 16:29.868
Yeah, no, that's just a reading edition.

16:29.968 --> 16:34.883
Quite frankly, it's the kind of book that we would put a couple of dollars on max and just put it into a reading table.

16:35.588 --> 16:43.015
All of the Dickens, of any consequence, are going to be during the actual publication dates, which are about 1832 to 1855.

16:43.776 --> 16:51.524
And the early American editions are valuable, not as valuable as the English editions, which are generally preceded by subscription editions.

16:52.025 --> 17:02.195
In other words, the books came out after they put them in a supplementary form and sent them every week to the individual who paid for them, and then they got 24 parts or 32 parts of a book.

17:02.255 --> 17:02.355
Sure.

17:02.335 --> 17:03.717
Then the first edition came out.

17:03.777 --> 17:06.141
Then the first American edition came out subsequently to that.

17:06.462 --> 17:12.371
What you probably have is the 7,453rd edition in a reprint.

17:12.632 --> 17:19.002
When I turned on the program and started listening, I went scurrying for the real prize and couldn't put hands on it in the attic.

17:19.022 --> 17:22.167
And that's a, I don't know, 1750s...

17:22.467 --> 17:27.698
Ben Franklin Publication of Advice to a Young Man, and I'm afraid I don't even remember the title.

17:27.978 --> 17:29.040
You know, that's a good book.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.227
I mean, there were more than one advice books by Franklin.

17:32.648 --> 17:36.696
Ben Franklin... That's one of his more racy ones, as I recall.

17:36.912 --> 17:39.996
Doesn't that include the advice on selecting a mistress?

17:40.116 --> 17:41.077
It does, yes.

17:41.137 --> 17:42.219
Is that advice on marriage?

17:42.519 --> 17:43.100
Yes.

17:44.742 --> 17:46.344
That's a valuable book.

17:47.045 --> 17:48.106
It's pretty beat up.

17:48.146 --> 17:51.670
It's leather, but the corners are really worn.

17:52.031 --> 17:55.615
Yeah, but just the case, is the contents intact?

17:55.635 --> 17:56.556
They are, yeah.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.958
Okay, is it the original boards?

17:58.630 --> 18:02.635
I have reason to think that it is if memory serves, and I wish I had it in my hand.

18:03.036 --> 18:05.719
Yeah, that's a book on the hundreds of dollars.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.923
Yeah, dependent on the condition, I really can't say how much.

18:08.943 --> 18:17.014
That's the kind of book that I would even, and I very rarely suggest this, that if the covers are tattered or in really poor condition, you might want to invest and rebind it.

18:17.234 --> 18:20.598
It's not going to enhance the value of the book generally, but it's going to protect it.

18:20.979 --> 18:23.642
And a book that early could justify a rebinding.

18:24.263 --> 18:26.368
Jay, thank you very much for calling us on The Book Guys.

18:26.388 --> 18:26.970
Thank you very much.

18:26.990 --> 18:27.651
Thank you now.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.157
That's Jay in Boston from all over the country.

18:30.197 --> 18:34.488
We take calls on The Book Guys at 1-800-828-BOOK.

18:34.909 --> 18:38.377
I'd like to tell you that in next week's program, we'll have a feature every week.

18:38.397 --> 18:41.344
Tonight we just sort of introduced ourselves, being our first broadcast.

18:41.324 --> 18:44.808
But next week, we're going to focus on these book fairs that you've been hearing about.

18:45.268 --> 18:48.812
Some of the best buys in bookdom or not.

18:49.132 --> 18:50.413
How to strategize yourself.

18:50.453 --> 18:58.342
If you're going to go into the book fair and you're going to be competing with dealers, how to get the good buys, how to recognize them, who to take along, and what sources you might need.

18:58.722 --> 19:01.385
We'll talk about that as our feature next week on The Book Guys.

19:01.665 --> 19:03.647
Have time for about one more quick call.

19:04.048 --> 19:05.509
Let's go to Poughkeepsie.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.852
And, Bea, you're on with The Book Guys.

19:07.892 --> 19:08.232
Hi there.

19:09.373 --> 19:10.234
Are you there, Bea?

19:10.535 --> 19:13.159
There she goes.

19:13.660 --> 19:21.432
I have a book which I found in my mother's attic, but it's not really that old, 1929.

19:22.975 --> 19:35.935
But it's what I call Art Deco, and the title is C-O-N-T-E-M-P-O, and it reads on the inside cover,

19:36.235 --> 19:40.962
This edition of Contempo is limited to 166 signed copies.

19:41.382 --> 19:45.508
This is number, and there's no number, but it's signed by both the authors.

19:45.989 --> 19:46.690
And who are the authors?

19:46.710 --> 19:47.371
John Vasos?

19:48.072 --> 19:48.453
Yes.

19:48.473 --> 19:48.953
Right?

19:48.973 --> 19:49.694
And Ruth.

19:49.714 --> 19:50.095
And Ruth.

19:50.275 --> 19:57.045
John Vasos is a very popular, he was a woodcut illustrator who was an Art Deco artist.

19:57.768 --> 19:59.732
Popular, popular author at the time.

20:00.173 --> 20:07.609
John Vasso's books sell for a minimum of $75 now to possibly $300 or $400 for one of the better books.

20:07.649 --> 20:13.903
And if you have an extraordinarily scarce Vasso's item, you'd probably be looking at the upper hundreds or lower thousands.

20:13.883 --> 20:18.969
What you probably have, so you said it's limited, but it doesn't show a limitation on it.

20:19.029 --> 20:21.873
You might have one of the books that was published out of sequence.

20:22.273 --> 20:35.189
Generally, when a book is published limited, they may have 175 copies, but they also have a runover of maybe four or five, which they give to the author or to the artist, the handout, or the publisher keeps a copy.

20:35.469 --> 20:40.195
This is called out of number, and generally is worth a little bit less

20:40.175 --> 20:41.376
than the limitation.

20:41.657 --> 20:46.363
Now, when you collect books which are limited, you want to get the number one copy the best you can.

20:46.383 --> 20:56.455
I mean, in this case, this book, Contempo is not a common book in the sense that it's accessible, but is a well-known book by Vassos.

20:56.656 --> 21:02.763
And the fact that you have it doubly signed in limitation, I would price it, depending on condition, at anywhere from $150 to $250.

21:03.084 --> 21:04.225
Uh-huh.

21:04.205 --> 21:07.849
That's a wonderful area is the Art Deco Woodcuts.

21:07.889 --> 21:09.351
There's Lynn Ward.

21:09.371 --> 21:13.356
I don't know if anybody knows who he is, but he has wonderful books.

21:14.817 --> 21:17.440
Hasn't he written novels in Just Woodcuts?

21:17.541 --> 21:18.321
Just Woodcuts, yeah.

21:18.341 --> 21:20.043
He has two books in Just Woodcuts.

21:20.344 --> 21:25.009
And Vasos are probably the two most collectible to Woodcut artists at that time period.

21:25.029 --> 21:29.755
But there's German Woodcut artists that are highly popular from that time period, too.

21:29.775 --> 21:32.558
And it's a great area to collect because it really appreciates.

21:32.538 --> 21:33.620
Thank you very much, Bea.

21:33.841 --> 21:34.382
Well, thank you.

21:34.422 --> 21:36.947
A very interesting book, as all the books have been.

21:37.869 --> 21:43.460
Very quickly, Alan, because we're almost out of time, what's hot currently that came out of the Boston Book Fair, for example?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.344
What's selling better than you expected?

21:45.384 --> 21:46.767
For me?

21:47.348 --> 21:48.250
Yeah, for anybody.

21:48.270 --> 21:49.112
Okay.

21:49.092 --> 22:02.876
I have just obtained the library of Chief Justice Warren Burger, and I have all these books inscribed to the Chief Justice by people that were involved with him while he was the sitting Supreme Court Justice.

22:03.016 --> 22:03.877
That was very hot.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.923
You had the Burger collection.

22:06.943 --> 22:08.165
I still have a lot of books.

22:08.185 --> 22:12.332
But other people, general modern literature is selling very well.

22:12.312 --> 22:16.903
We'll find out what's hot next week with The Book Guys as we join you for our second broadcast.

22:16.923 --> 22:18.628
We're glad you joined us this evening.

22:19.089 --> 22:23.820
