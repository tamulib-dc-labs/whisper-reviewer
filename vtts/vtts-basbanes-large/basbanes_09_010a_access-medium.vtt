WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:06.288
If they were actually going to be here, I could put them off.

00:06.308 --> 00:08.030
That's fine.

00:08.230 --> 00:12.777
I've read the book, so what we need is a really refreshing change of pace.

00:12.797 --> 00:14.099
I've got tons of notes on it.

00:16.302 --> 00:20.669
Of course, it's hard to interview somebody when you're already with them.

00:20.689 --> 00:25.977
But tell me, I just did a PW interview with James Carroll in his new memoir.

00:26.658 --> 00:27.599
Is it about his father?

00:27.619 --> 00:28.480
It's about his father.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.223
Of course, this is a father he knew.

00:31.047 --> 00:33.189
You know, his father recently died.

00:33.209 --> 00:35.251
He was an adult, and this is kind of different.

00:35.271 --> 00:38.974
You're searching for a father he really didn't know at all, I guess.

00:39.815 --> 00:44.119
Or I knew in a... In an untruthful way, I guess.

00:44.139 --> 00:45.700
Or a fabricated way.

00:46.381 --> 00:51.405
Or some of the ways that I knew him were very intense and very real.

00:52.226 --> 00:57.991
So that it seems to me the real part of my father was the part that I knew as a child.

00:58.051 --> 01:01.054
That was the part where he wasn't lying and wasn't faking.

01:01.540 --> 01:06.244
in his love for me and his ability to be with a child.

01:06.485 --> 01:20.698
One of the wonderful things that's happened, and it hasn't been a wholly pleasant journey, as you can imagine, but the few people who are alive who remember my father mostly remember him as children.

01:21.479 --> 01:25.723
And they all have absolutely magic memories of him.

01:26.423 --> 01:31.328
The stepson, for instance, is an amazing story.

01:32.337 --> 01:41.871
I'm just trying to define the forces that moved you to pursue this thing.

01:41.891 --> 01:44.875
And to write it in a memoir, too.

01:44.995 --> 01:49.041
Well, because his story is much too unreal to put into fiction.

01:49.201 --> 01:52.727
Everybody would say, this character is not believable.

01:52.767 --> 01:53.668
What's your problem?

01:54.469 --> 02:02.040
I think I decided that I needed to do it in the process of writing.

02:03.269 --> 02:05.612
I began with an image of my grandmother's house.

02:05.672 --> 02:07.595
I didn't think I was writing about my father.

02:08.236 --> 02:10.319
I thought I was writing about my grandmother's house.

02:10.999 --> 02:25.459
And I realized that what I was really writing about was the terrible shock of losing my father, going from the house or the apartment where we had lived, to the place which would mark the shape of the rest of my life, which was without him.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.605
And in writing about that house, I realized I was writing about my father's death.

02:29.705 --> 02:32.128
And then I had more to write about my father's death

02:32.648 --> 02:35.532
Suddenly I had about 100 pages about my father's death.

02:36.533 --> 02:42.560
And I said, oh, okay, it's time now to find out the stuff which I always could have looked for.

02:42.580 --> 02:47.186
At any earlier time, I could have looked and I didn't.

02:47.226 --> 02:48.728
And how old were you?

02:48.748 --> 02:49.729
You give it to me in the book.

02:49.889 --> 02:50.530
When I started.

02:50.590 --> 02:53.433
Yeah, when you actually started the investigation, which is what it is.

02:54.755 --> 02:56.137
You become a detective here.

02:57.358 --> 02:59.901
Well, 1992, so I was 43.

03:00.322 --> 03:00.462
Mm-hmm.

03:01.927 --> 03:03.248
How old was your father when he died?

03:03.949 --> 03:04.650
He was 62.

03:06.332 --> 03:11.377
Had he lived longer and, you know, to your teens, what do you think?

03:12.998 --> 03:22.088
I always think that... Would you have had this mythical image of him or you think you would have unmasked him, so to speak, in life?

03:22.108 --> 03:23.009
I don't think so.

03:23.169 --> 03:31.798
I think I would have been unable to distance myself from him because he was a very...

03:32.352 --> 03:37.097
seductive figure, not only to me, but to many other people.

03:37.117 --> 03:41.682
And I think I'd be an enormously different, possibly crazy person.

03:42.482 --> 03:51.572
But I think I would have been, when I imagined what I would have been with Adam, I imagine myself very much under his spell.

03:51.592 --> 03:58.819
What was the greatest shock for you to find, I mean, the anti-Semitism, the fact that the circumstances of his birth?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.482
I'm just wondering, it just seems like there was one shocking

04:02.052 --> 04:06.759
and I hate to use the word revelation, but it does seem that it almost takes on that quality.

04:07.399 --> 04:13.868
I think I've known about the anti-Semitism for a while, so that wasn't shocking.

04:13.969 --> 04:20.117
And also the atmosphere in which I grew up was so anti-Semitic, that in a way that wasn't shocking.

04:21.359 --> 04:25.685
Two things were most shocking to me, in a way they both had to do with language and writing.

04:26.886 --> 04:30.912
I was very shocked to know that he had another language, Yiddish,

04:31.567 --> 04:32.848
that he never shared with me.

04:34.129 --> 04:40.115
And that, I felt, was his greatest betrayal of me, not to have shared that language with me.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.437
You'd like to have that language?

04:42.457 --> 04:42.817
Yes, yes.

04:43.898 --> 04:49.984
So I didn't have the language of his childhood, and that felt like a great betrayal.

04:50.605 --> 04:58.452
Also, what I had to learn and to come to terms with, and I'm still not there completely, is I always thought that he was a really good writer.

04:59.798 --> 05:04.963
And as a professional writer yourself, this has to be really... I'm sorry to interrupt.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.124
No, no, you're right.

05:06.164 --> 05:21.580
And as I read more and more of the stuff, one of the funny stories, because my, you know, one self... Even when you think you're stripped of self-deception, there's always a layer of self-deception that doesn't want to go.

05:21.600 --> 05:28.287
And I thought that I was really confronting...

05:28.469 --> 05:42.845
everything, and I wrote a chapter, the chapter about his writing was originally 120 pages long, and it was full of excerpts of his writing, which I still, up to two years ago, thought were just wonderful.

05:44.287 --> 05:46.249
But when was the last time you had read it?

05:47.190 --> 05:49.993
I hadn't read it for 20 years.

05:50.554 --> 05:53.637
But even two years ago, I was still saying this is the beginning.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.359
But you hadn't read it for only 20 years.

05:55.819 --> 05:58.122
My point is, it's like going back to read Thomas Wolfe,

05:58.591 --> 06:00.653
at this age, you know.

06:00.673 --> 06:04.538
It's not as good as it was when we were kids and we read it for the first time.

06:04.758 --> 06:08.442
That's my feeling, but I don't know if it's... But I was still holding on to that.

06:08.883 --> 06:16.231
I gave him this 120-page chapter, and finally my agent said to me, you know, nobody's interested in his writing.

06:16.251 --> 06:16.651
It's true.

06:16.872 --> 06:17.893
It's not very good.

06:17.933 --> 06:22.838
We're interested in hearing you talk about his writing.

06:23.459 --> 06:25.341
And that was a terrible moment for me.

06:26.232 --> 06:29.056
when somebody said, you're a better writer than he is.

06:30.258 --> 06:32.782
Why was it terrible for you, though?

06:32.802 --> 06:34.225
Did you want him to be better than you?

06:34.245 --> 06:38.591
I did want him to be better than me.

06:38.612 --> 06:38.712
Yeah.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.436
I'm looking for the follow-up on that, but why?

06:42.337 --> 06:52.273
That's all part of the... Because I think one of the hardest, what the real rite of passage of this novel was, was that I had to give up

06:53.789 --> 06:56.332
my identity as primarily a daughter.

06:57.253 --> 07:08.885
And in a way, it's a more comfortable position to say, you know, I am the daughter of the great man than I'm the daughter who has surpassed her father.

07:09.866 --> 07:15.392
That involves guilt, whereas the other, you know, I could imagine it would involve resentment.

07:15.932 --> 07:17.434
But you feel kind of protected.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.012
by the great one who went before you.

07:20.032 --> 07:22.154
But if you have to say, I stepped over him.

07:22.174 --> 07:29.341
I noticed when you decide to name your son after your father, your husband said, you really want to do this?

07:29.361 --> 07:30.643
He's mad and he's evil.

07:30.743 --> 07:34.387
And you say, and you still name your son.

07:34.667 --> 07:42.895
So there's almost a reluctance here on your part to cut him loose.

07:42.975 --> 07:44.697
And I don't finally want to cut him loose.

07:45.538 --> 07:46.459
I was trying to

07:47.738 --> 08:01.259
The reason that I think if this book has wider significance for people who didn't have this odd biographical circumstance, what it's really about is how to keep the parent who is problematic.

08:02.321 --> 08:09.593
That you don't have to completely reject that parent because they gave you a kind of love that was very formative and valuable.

08:10.093 --> 08:14.320
To me, the challenge is to bear witness to my father's madness.

08:15.312 --> 08:26.283
and also to bear witness to the good things that he gave me, and to say both are true, that he is a man whom I'm ashamed of and whom I love simultaneously.

08:26.303 --> 08:30.668
How about the need to write for strangers?

08:31.148 --> 08:32.449
I mean, there were strangers reading this.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.132
It really is laying yourself bare.

08:35.192 --> 08:39.076
I mean, you're almost exposing yourself in public.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.498
It has to be very painful.

08:41.599 --> 08:44.982
It was very painful, but it would have been worse not to do it.

08:45.738 --> 08:47.840
Because it was so urgent.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.081
It didn't feel like a choice.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.743
It felt like a necessity.

08:51.763 --> 08:57.288
I mean, is it a sense of confession on your part?

08:59.250 --> 09:02.733
I think it was more a sense of exploration.

09:02.893 --> 09:06.156
And since I'm a writer, I had to do it in writing.

09:06.617 --> 09:07.958
So then what were my choices?

09:08.158 --> 09:10.080
Either I publish it or I don't publish it.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.922
And if it's good, why wouldn't I publish it?

09:12.942 --> 09:13.703
Of course.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.450
Everything for me has to be done through writing.

09:18.313 --> 09:20.156
I asked Jim Carroll, you know, this and that.

09:20.377 --> 09:22.921
I said, how do you feel having written this book?

09:22.981 --> 09:24.704
And he said, I wish I could tell you I feel good.

09:24.724 --> 09:25.486
Yeah.

09:26.888 --> 09:27.810
He quoted his father.

09:28.110 --> 09:28.711
Heartbreaking.

09:29.453 --> 09:32.919
And I used this quote in my PW interview with him, which I think is in next week.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.582
And how do you feel?

09:34.662 --> 09:36.505
I mean, do you feel better for it?

09:36.826 --> 09:37.547
I mean, do you feel...

09:38.557 --> 09:40.239
I hate to use the word exorcism.

09:40.619 --> 09:44.442
No, no, I don't think that you ever do exercise it.

09:45.043 --> 09:58.875
You know, for me, because the shaping of it or the art of it is at least as much a part of it as the subject matter, there's a part of me that says, well, I did something I'm proud of.

10:01.678 --> 10:07.483
In a sort of practical way, in the realm of actions,

10:08.223 --> 10:19.519
My moving his grave was a very satisfying act to me and did give me a sense of change and closure.

10:20.600 --> 10:26.328
And I don't think I would have had the courage to do that, because that was what everybody thought was really freaky and weird.

10:26.348 --> 10:31.315
I don't think I would have had the courage to do that again unless it were, in a sense, part of a writing project.

10:32.496 --> 10:38.044
So in a very almost primitive way, feeling that I'd moved his bones

10:38.969 --> 10:44.357
to a place where he could be the head of a new dynasty and have his name on a stone.

10:44.918 --> 10:51.428
That was of great comfort to me, and I felt like I had changed something and finished something.

10:51.448 --> 11:02.225
He has figured so prominently in your fiction in various ways, and you suggest some of the ways in here, and I think even John Leonard in his piece, I thought, did you see it?

11:02.305 --> 11:04.087
Yeah, that's great.

11:04.107 --> 11:05.770
It was a piece, and of course,

11:06.087 --> 11:10.193
He had to pat himself on the shoulder, having even seen this in final payments.

11:11.475 --> 11:16.622
All right, having done this book now, and as a young woman with many books ahead of you.

11:17.383 --> 11:18.584
Thanks.

11:18.604 --> 11:21.929
Nice to hear you still think I'm young.

11:21.949 --> 11:28.899
I just, at 52, published my first book last year, which is going into its fifth printing right now.

11:28.919 --> 11:30.741
I'm pretty pleased about that.

11:31.402 --> 11:31.943
In any case,

11:32.227 --> 11:37.014
How do you see him affecting your work now, or do you see him not affecting your work?

11:37.034 --> 11:39.818
You know, I think I'm finished with him as a subject.

11:39.838 --> 11:49.392
And of course, having said that, I just realized, the minute you said that, I realized how he's figuring in a book that I'm just even now thinking about.

11:49.412 --> 11:53.097
But I mean, in terms of the baggage that he's certainly, you've had to carry.

11:53.117 --> 12:01.710
I think he'll, if he figures and when he figures, because I think you're right, he'll probably always figure, it will be

12:01.994 --> 12:04.277
in a less idealized way.

12:04.297 --> 12:10.025
You know, in one of our earlier interviews, you told me how difficult it was for you to deal with male sexuality.

12:10.726 --> 12:12.909
Do you still feel that that will be the case?

12:15.432 --> 12:31.714
I think it's... I haven't changed in the men's traditional male sexuality with all its sense of entitlement and all its sense of having the right to objectify

12:32.369 --> 12:34.973
is something I don't understand and I never will.

12:36.335 --> 12:46.970
I think I understand somewhat vexed male sexuality a little bit differently and a little bit better now.

12:48.072 --> 12:56.183
That is to say, good men for whom sexuality is not just a panty raid or a tailgate party.

12:56.264 --> 12:57.485
I think I understand that better.

12:58.827 --> 13:02.072
Your mother is an offstage character here.

13:02.457 --> 13:04.199
get to her towards the end.

13:06.841 --> 13:08.963
I'll see where the question goes from here.

13:09.184 --> 13:12.226
Your mother certainly has not affected you in any way like your father has.

13:12.246 --> 13:12.967
Not really so.

13:13.388 --> 13:30.304
Except that what my mother gave me, which is less easy to write about, but in some ways pervades my life, is she was a person of tremendous endurance and somebody who just believed in getting the job done.

13:31.516 --> 13:32.838
and going forward.

13:33.639 --> 13:40.187
And I think, you know, I see it in my students, the ones who will become writers and the ones who won't.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.890
The crucial difference isn't just talent.

13:43.931 --> 13:51.000
It's who can stick to it and who can get up in the morning and sit down and write, whether they feel like it or not.

13:52.101 --> 13:54.824
And I think that part of me came from my mother.

13:54.844 --> 13:55.285
Really?

13:55.305 --> 13:57.908
Of course, the talent is important, isn't it?

13:57.928 --> 13:58.128
Of course.

13:58.148 --> 14:00.291
But there are so many who are talented.

14:00.642 --> 14:02.704
that won't be able to harness it.

14:02.724 --> 14:15.939
Well, what did your mother, do you feel that your mother and your, these women that you grew up with, what did they know about your father that they didn't, that they could have told you, do you think?

14:15.959 --> 14:16.359
Nothing.

14:16.379 --> 14:22.165
So they were in the same mythic envelope as, oh my God, sure.

14:22.205 --> 14:26.430
But you do also suggest that they were

14:26.798 --> 14:30.122
Your mother was happier, not happier, but he seemed relieved.

14:30.162 --> 14:33.587
He must have been a real handful.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.990
He was difficult to live with, really.

14:36.010 --> 14:38.353
I think he was crazy.

14:39.754 --> 14:45.181
And not only was he crazy, he was certainly not the 50s bourgeois ideal of the good provider.

14:46.503 --> 14:53.532
And when I think about what my mother had to do, she was handicapped, she went off to work, she had no household help,

14:53.933 --> 14:57.297
He was completely domestically incompetent, except that he did take care of me.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.721
But she really worked like a horse.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.825
And I think... And she didn't have to anymore.

15:04.845 --> 15:06.027
Right.

15:06.047 --> 15:08.189
Because then she just moved in and my grandmother did everything.

15:08.569 --> 15:09.871
So it was a better deal for her.

15:10.331 --> 15:12.414
You know, I think they were a great romance.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.136
I think they really were a love match.

15:14.796 --> 15:21.544
But I think that, like a lot of other people, it dissipated the friction of living together pretty quickly.

15:22.942 --> 15:23.943
It's an amazing story.

15:24.183 --> 15:24.764
It really is.

15:25.264 --> 15:46.502
And I jotted down all these, you know, the dark side of the immigration story, which is, you know, you'd like to think there's this great, hopeful, triumphant kind of a story, and it just took a really, and you still don't have an answer, do you, for the why?

15:46.903 --> 15:47.063
No.

15:47.083 --> 15:50.206
The why still eludes you, doesn't it?

15:50.226 --> 15:51.767
It's always going to be a dark.

15:51.983 --> 15:53.424
Do you have any guesses?

15:54.926 --> 16:01.872
You know, I have the speculations that I put in the speculative chapter, which is that it's about anti-Semitism.

16:01.932 --> 16:06.376
It's about a family which seems, at best, chaotic.

16:08.698 --> 16:11.781
But there were a lot of chaotic immigrant families.

16:12.401 --> 16:14.924
Anti-Semitism was in the air for a lot of people.

16:15.364 --> 16:19.948
Why, for example, didn't my father become a communist, like most other Jews?

16:20.333 --> 16:21.796
in the 20s and 30s.

16:22.156 --> 16:22.978
I don't know.

16:23.739 --> 16:34.799
I think it was almost a kind of aesthetic that the Catholic Church represented for him that in some mysterious way seems to have been in his bones at a very early time.

16:35.279 --> 16:36.141
And what put it there?

16:36.481 --> 16:38.205
I don't know.

16:38.225 --> 16:43.033
I love the story of you taking your 13-year-old daughter to the library and then she

16:43.621 --> 16:47.828
I've been filing stories now by email, and I can't do it.

16:48.529 --> 16:53.818
And my younger daughter comes in, and she's zing-zing with the mouse, and it's done.

16:53.839 --> 16:57.785
And I look at her with absolute eye.

16:57.805 --> 16:59.168
These kids are great.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.550
They really are part of this.

17:01.137 --> 17:06.182
And it was kind of nice that you brought your daughter into that.

17:06.262 --> 17:09.585
Of course, what I didn't say was that she was completely hysterical laughing at me.

17:11.947 --> 17:23.399
This feeling, I had to as one who spent, you know, uncounted hours on microfilm and archives, and people think this stuff can be dull, but it's amazing.

17:23.959 --> 17:28.984
I can almost feel the goose pimples rising when you're saying,

17:29.386 --> 17:32.549
where you're making this moment of discovery in the records.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.373
And you almost don't want it to be true, especially where it involves you.

17:36.393 --> 17:38.756
I've never done anything like that where it involves myself.

17:39.617 --> 17:43.861
But just that moment when you find what you're looking for.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.524
And the name, of course, is real.

17:48.886 --> 17:51.069
And it changes when he's a young, very young.

17:51.289 --> 17:54.693
They changed all the children's names.

17:54.713 --> 17:58.937
So this had to have something to do with the parents as well that we don't know anything about.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.454
And you would really like to know what caused this rejection.

18:03.634 --> 18:13.524
And then a moment of archival horror is I'm at the files of the nursing home.

18:13.544 --> 18:15.446
My grandmother's name is in the records.

18:16.287 --> 18:21.412
There are all these files with the narrative history of the family, and my grandmother's isn't there.

18:22.913 --> 18:23.214
Why?

18:26.597 --> 18:27.358
And there's nothing.

18:27.418 --> 18:27.999
What can I do?

18:28.059 --> 18:29.380
There's nothing I can do about it.

18:30.085 --> 18:33.909
Do you feel you've brought it as far as you can bring it now?

18:33.929 --> 18:34.329
I think so.

18:34.349 --> 18:35.410
And you're comfortable with it?

18:36.552 --> 18:36.872
Yeah.

18:36.972 --> 18:39.555
I mean, I'm comfortable that I've done everything I can do.

18:42.217 --> 18:44.079
And I think, again, this is important.

18:44.279 --> 18:57.713
I'm saying something important about the roots fantasy, which is that if you just get to the right record, you will find the story, and that all questions are answerable.

18:58.233 --> 19:05.562
Well, one of the things about the past is that it's full of erasures and full of darkness, and we have to be able to tolerate that.

19:06.263 --> 19:08.326
And in some ways, that's very, very painful.

19:09.007 --> 19:14.353
It's even better to know a true, terrible story than to have to say, the past is gone.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.156
It's not mine.

19:16.236 --> 19:16.997
I can't have it.

19:17.077 --> 19:18.318
I have no access to it.

19:18.338 --> 19:27.430
And I think all these, you know, I mean, I don't know if you've ever done this, but in these kind of genealogical collections,

19:28.203 --> 19:29.364
It's fascinating.

19:29.785 --> 19:34.711
All race lines are crossed, class lines are crossed, age lines are crossed.

19:34.811 --> 19:35.632
They're buzzing.

19:36.454 --> 19:38.476
These libraries are just buzzing.

19:38.496 --> 19:38.937
Oh, they're wonderful.

19:38.957 --> 19:45.826
People are fascinated with trying to find out where they came from.

19:45.846 --> 19:48.609
Was there a sense of anger at all with you?

19:48.629 --> 19:48.689
No.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.313
Were you mad at him when you were finding out these things?

19:51.513 --> 19:51.773
No.

19:52.053 --> 19:53.575
I just deep pity.

19:54.517 --> 19:55.758
You know what Jim Carroll says?

19:55.778 --> 19:56.539
It's heartbreaking.

19:57.080 --> 19:57.180
Yeah.

19:58.257 --> 20:02.681
This is a genre that has really blossomed lately.

20:02.761 --> 20:04.723
It's almost a brand new genre of writing.

20:06.765 --> 20:09.988
Of course, I hate feeling like I'm part of a trend, but what can I do?

20:10.008 --> 20:25.243
Well, I mean, the Mary Carr book I think of, which I thought was wonderful, and Jim's book, and that New York Times magazine piece pretty much established or identified it as a genre.

20:25.814 --> 20:28.858
You say you don't like to be identified as being part of it.

20:28.898 --> 20:29.739
I always hate that.

20:29.779 --> 20:33.965
I like to think that everything I did was completely original, has nothing to do with anybody else.

20:34.205 --> 20:35.146
Of course, that's not true.

20:35.867 --> 20:39.552
But the memoir, the very personal memoir, this is quite a photograph.

20:39.592 --> 20:41.935
Where did that one come from?

20:41.955 --> 20:47.883
Just from our scrapbook, family scrapbook.

20:47.983 --> 20:50.146
Pardon me for being a little spastic this morning.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.568
I've been up since five.

20:53.190 --> 20:55.753
And the name Mary Catherine, you know, that's hardly...

20:56.206 --> 21:00.950
Oh, Father D is a very interesting story, isn't it?

21:00.970 --> 21:07.496
And then your guess, pure guesswork, that your mother was desperately in love with him and he desperately in love with him.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.417
Now, is this the fiction writer working, or is this?

21:10.858 --> 21:16.623
Well, I look at photographs of my mother with him, and it looks like the face of a woman in love.

21:18.345 --> 21:25.791
And then the way that he talked about my father to me and the letters that he wrote, I mean, that's quite a line, you know.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.507
Don't complain to me.

21:27.567 --> 21:29.509
You at least have a child of his loins.

21:29.629 --> 21:30.390
I have nothing.

21:31.251 --> 21:33.233
That sounds like love to me.

21:33.353 --> 21:36.557
Yeah, sure, the loins is quite an image.

21:37.538 --> 21:38.379
Do you hear his voice?

21:38.419 --> 21:39.180
Can you hear his voice?

21:39.200 --> 21:40.782
No.

21:40.802 --> 21:42.244
I can hear him say two words.

21:43.205 --> 21:45.608
Automobile and water.

21:47.971 --> 21:50.854
And why those two words?

21:50.874 --> 21:53.577
Because I think he said them in a way that wasn't New York.

21:53.697 --> 21:55.980
He said automobile like automobile.

21:56.062 --> 21:58.746
And he said, water, instead of water.

21:59.687 --> 22:03.993
And I think the differentness... Was it mid-western, do you think, or middle?

22:04.254 --> 22:06.797
He was too young, I guess.

22:06.817 --> 22:07.138
Do you love him?

22:07.158 --> 22:08.379
Oh, I do love him, yeah.

22:08.399 --> 22:11.404
I do love him.

22:11.424 --> 22:12.846
Well, that's important to point out.

22:12.966 --> 22:16.911
I mean, this is not... You're not eviscerating him so much here, are you?

22:17.132 --> 22:17.352
No.

22:18.774 --> 22:23.841
I'm trying, as I said, simultaneously to bear witness and to keep him.

22:25.804 --> 22:25.984
And...

22:26.943 --> 22:30.006
Because I think in the end, that's what everybody has to do about a parent.

22:30.066 --> 22:35.852
There are always going to be parts of your parents that are abhorrent, even in the most beloved parents.

22:36.953 --> 22:53.108
And how do you maintain that balance between separating yourself and being able to say, I don't like that, and to keep the love and the gratitude and the enormous bond?

22:53.128 --> 22:54.550
You don't feel betrayed?

22:54.570 --> 22:54.790
No.

22:55.883 --> 23:05.114
That line, I love you more than God, have you resolved for yourself whether he loved you more than God does or he loves you more than he loves God?

23:05.134 --> 23:05.634
I don't know.

23:06.335 --> 23:07.096
Probably both.

23:08.858 --> 23:12.943
But that's a lot of weight to have to carry, too, isn't it, for a little girl?

23:12.963 --> 23:21.913
On the other hand, it's sort of a good thing for a writer because it makes you think you're the most important person in the world.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.317
Let's see what else I have to...

23:27.372 --> 23:31.156
And then, of course, it is something that, oh, the library, isn't it?

23:31.176 --> 23:38.524
I mean, you talk about, I mean, he has the fatal attack in the New York Public Library.

23:39.204 --> 23:43.289
You talk about, I mean, you couldn't invent something like that, could you?

23:43.449 --> 23:46.352
You see, if I put that in fiction, they'd say, oh, it's too corny.

23:46.732 --> 23:53.920
I'm not going to compare this with Jim's book at all, but I mean, he said, if I were to write this as a novel,

23:54.541 --> 24:01.609
You know, the priest, and he has a brother who's an FBI agent, another brother who's a draft dodger, who his brother has to find, basically.

24:02.110 --> 24:06.455
And he's out demonstrating in front of the Pentagon, and his father's in there picking the targets.

24:07.296 --> 24:10.300
They laugh me out of it.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.862
Nobody would ever believe these stories.

24:12.342 --> 24:15.166
And so, you know, go figure it out.

24:15.226 --> 24:16.387
It is amazing, isn't it?

24:16.968 --> 24:22.995
And it's so American, you know, that a child can go so far from...

24:23.347 --> 24:27.452
or her parents, and yet still be connected in some way.

24:28.414 --> 24:33.701
I know you've got another interview coming up in about five or ten minutes, so I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

24:33.761 --> 24:40.630
I have the book, you know, which is the most important thing, and Jack Dinsmore.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.936
You're Jack Dinsmore's daughter, right?

24:45.757 --> 24:49.101
How does that come at you when you hear something like that?

24:50.245 --> 24:51.668
Well, I loved that.

24:51.788 --> 24:56.036
I like the Jack Dentons more part of him until it starts to turn anti-Semitic.

24:56.216 --> 25:03.891
But, you know, the magazine was kind of stupid, but it was lively.

25:04.051 --> 25:04.652
Embarrassing.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.656
It was embarrassing, but it was lively.

25:07.518 --> 25:08.199
It was fun.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.928
And I think I'm like anything in life that's kind of on the side of fun.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.952
Who was his audience, do you think, his target audience?

25:16.193 --> 25:17.414
It was very successful.

25:17.554 --> 25:22.179
It ran for 14 years, which is extraordinary for a humor magazine.

25:22.719 --> 25:37.735
I think, again, his great model for that was Mencken, and that there was an audience for a kind of man, and I think it was almost exclusively male, who

25:38.845 --> 25:48.377
And probably a lot of them were self-educated, longing for a culture that they didn't quite get, but wanting to say, we're not highfalutin.

25:48.857 --> 25:57.047
We can laugh, we can have a drink with the guys down at the bar, but also in our rooms there's a copy of The Temptation of St.

25:57.067 --> 25:57.568
Anthony.

25:58.449 --> 25:59.731
And I think that was the audience.

26:00.471 --> 26:05.798
And then I think there were probably just a lot of guys in Cleveland who wanted to look at pictures of girls.

26:06.841 --> 26:08.062
And, of course, he taught you to read.

26:08.302 --> 26:12.647
And he taught me French and Latin.

26:13.348 --> 26:17.832
Also, he gave me what was very rare for a young girl growing up in the 50s.

26:18.353 --> 26:22.897
He gave me complete permission to use my mind for the same freedom that a boy would have.

26:23.738 --> 26:25.220
You know, he said I could do anything.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.803
And gender was absolutely not in the discourse.

26:28.823 --> 26:29.924
And you talk about ironies.

26:31.326 --> 26:32.427
You know, you're a

26:32.744 --> 26:37.350
dream as a child was to grow up and be his helper, I guess, almost his acolyte in a way.

26:38.311 --> 26:41.755
And that wouldn't have happened had he lived, I'm sure, but you don't know.

26:42.616 --> 26:44.278
It might have.

26:44.358 --> 26:45.199
It might have.

26:45.219 --> 26:48.443
The capacity for self-delusion can be endless.

26:48.463 --> 26:54.430
But again, I think as you grew older, you would have discovered things about him that maybe you would have.

26:54.750 --> 26:55.351
You don't know that.

26:56.973 --> 27:02.059
I could have, like a lot of people do with even a lot of abused children,

27:02.512 --> 27:06.919
set up a universe in which the abuser is recast as a hero.

27:07.741 --> 27:12.188
Because if that's what you really need, that's the best thing in your universe.

27:13.050 --> 27:14.592
You recast it, in a way.

27:15.694 --> 27:19.180
It is, I think, worth knowing that you've dealt with this through writing.

27:19.681 --> 27:28.536
You haven't had to go see therapists or anything like that, as many people might have to, I would think, or many young women with fathers.

27:29.022 --> 27:29.604
Whatever.

27:29.624 --> 27:33.238
And so this writing certainly was therapeutic for you here, wasn't it?

27:33.378 --> 27:35.607
In that way, yeah.

27:35.627 --> 27:37.052
Would you sign a couple of books for me?

27:37.514 --> 27:38.678
One for me and one for my editor.
