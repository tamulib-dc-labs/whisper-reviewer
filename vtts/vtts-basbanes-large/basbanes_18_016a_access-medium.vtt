00:02.984 --> 00:08.613
Well, congratulations, Mr. Kozner, on your new assignment at Esquire.

00:09.895 --> 00:10.196
Thank you.

00:10.276 --> 00:13.161
And I guess, where do we start?

00:13.181 --> 00:16.426
Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself first?

00:16.446 --> 00:18.830
Okay, how about if I... I'll shut this up again.

00:19.251 --> 00:20.293
Ship recorder is running.

00:21.154 --> 00:24.840
Okay, well, tell me what you found, Mr. Kozner, when you...

00:25.242 --> 00:26.063
went to Esquire.

00:26.283 --> 00:28.045
Was it a moribund magazine?

00:28.165 --> 00:29.406
No, not at all.

00:29.486 --> 00:43.681
I think it was a magazine that, first of all, has a superlative staff, and it's got one of the great histories, legacies, and nameplates in American magazines.

00:44.402 --> 00:49.647
I think that there were elements in the magazine that were less successful than others.

00:49.981 --> 00:56.989
And there were also some elements that were not in there that had been in the magazine in the past.

00:57.009 --> 01:11.587
And so what I've been trying to do is simply to, in a sense, restore it to what it's traditionally been, rather than to make a radical reinvention or something like that.

01:12.688 --> 01:18.655
When we talk about what it traditionally has been... Well, for example, it always had...

01:19.225 --> 01:34.079
It was always a good deal about the relationship between men and women, what people call relationship stories, and stories about the state of manhood and men's relations with women.

01:34.119 --> 01:38.063
And I think they had gotten away from that over the last several years.

01:38.623 --> 01:40.225
I don't know why, but they just had.

01:40.245 --> 01:45.410
And it just wasn't covering that area.

01:45.670 --> 01:46.971
And it was...

01:47.390 --> 02:02.682
Esquires always had a wonderful literary tradition, but I think that the fiction had evolved a bit into a preoccupation with kind of Western American writers who were excellent, but they were only one part of it.

02:03.235 --> 02:24.771
of the spectrum of course esquire's reputation and this is my field as well um my my interest certainly i mean the great writers who who if if if they weren't introduced at esquire certainly they they wrote with great distinction and they've been the pages i mean but they weren't restricted to one genre

02:25.595 --> 02:31.323
Well, I mean, we're talking about Hemingway, Faulkner, not Faulkner, but did Faulkner write for Esquire?

02:31.343 --> 02:34.047
Yeah, I mean... These people wrote across the spectrum.

02:34.067 --> 02:39.234
They weren't only, say, He-Man writers or something like that.

02:39.254 --> 02:44.281
And so what I've tried to do is to broaden out the fiction mix.

02:45.663 --> 02:54.775
I've introduced a section of the magazine called The Reader, which from time to most months runs...

02:55.548 --> 03:25.521
page and a half excerpts from a selection of new books both fiction and non-fiction and also a play we did an excerpt from Tony Kushner's next play and we'll run short memoirs and various things like that so this is a way to give the reader on a monthly basis a sampling of some of the interesting books that are going to be published during the next month or two

03:25.923 --> 03:36.422
And in the course of a year, a reader will get exposure to 50 or 60 books, as against simply printing eight short stories.

03:36.588 --> 03:39.351
And you mean as excerpts?

03:39.511 --> 03:40.692
Yeah, as excerpts.

03:40.812 --> 03:49.621
And we've run, in the first several months, excerpts from Updike's book, Brazil, and we've run an excerpt from V.S.

03:49.641 --> 03:51.883
Naipaul's new book.

03:51.963 --> 03:57.729
We ran an excerpt from Brent Staple's book.

03:58.029 --> 04:04.215
And, in fact, I was pleased that in the first couple of months of doing this, three of the

04:04.735 --> 04:15.211
books that we'd chosen to highlight wound up with long and very favorable page one reviews in the Times Book Review.

04:15.231 --> 04:16.993
Yeah, that was great.

04:17.594 --> 04:27.649
So it's a way to keep the literary dimension of the magazine alive, but not restricted entirely to original new fiction.

04:27.970 --> 04:28.971
At the same time,

04:29.204 --> 04:33.208
We published a wonderful story by Don DeLillo a few months ago.

04:33.628 --> 04:35.810
I was just looking at that one about a half hour ago.

04:35.850 --> 04:42.937
In July, our next issue, which is coming out next week, week after.

04:42.957 --> 04:57.490
The July issue is the summer reading issue, and it has Annie Proulx and Vince Pissarro, a new novel that he's bringing out, and an amazing...

04:57.858 --> 05:01.724
illustrated Kafka by R. Crumb.

05:02.926 --> 05:05.329
Kafka has illustrated the metamorphosis.

05:05.790 --> 05:08.354
That's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

05:08.454 --> 05:11.879
And a story by Mark Richard.

05:12.781 --> 05:15.364
So, you know, there's a... You're working.

05:15.605 --> 05:16.506
Oh, yeah.

05:16.546 --> 05:16.907
That's great.

05:16.947 --> 05:17.468
Stuff in.

05:18.008 --> 05:18.890
That's just part of it.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.374
Another element was the service element.

05:21.594 --> 05:24.979
And, again, at different times in its history...

05:25.347 --> 05:31.317
Esquire had very, very sophisticated and very effective service pieces.

05:32.779 --> 05:39.249
And for a while, I think they got away from that some, not entirely, but somewhat.

05:39.309 --> 05:47.623
And so I put in a section called the Guide, and each month the Guide deals with a single subject.

05:47.643 --> 05:50.207
The first one was about sexual performance.

05:50.845 --> 05:59.440
The next one was about how to take up golf, which I guess you do if you run out of outlets for your sexual performance.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.028
We have one on how to keep your hair and what to do to keep from losing it.

06:04.629 --> 06:08.837
We have one coming out on the new... It just came out on the new computer chips.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.660
No, this isn't tongue-in-cheek.

06:10.921 --> 06:11.421
No, no, no.

06:11.441 --> 06:12.904
This is an eight-page...

06:13.475 --> 06:16.639
serious service pieces.

06:17.260 --> 06:21.505
Service means like a consumer guy type thing.

06:21.525 --> 06:24.009
Well, not too much of products, but it tells you everything.

06:24.129 --> 06:29.235
In other words, the golf one tells you what equipment you really need to store.

06:29.255 --> 06:33.501
It gives you a sense of which of the best instructional books and videos are.

06:33.521 --> 06:36.765
It talks about clothes, talks about

06:36.897 --> 07:04.272
joining a country club or using a public course and it's it's a complete introduction if you're a man who wants to take up golf you read these eight pages and you know everything you have to do to get started we have one coming out on gambling shortly tell you everything about house odds at different casinos and the odds on different games and the

07:04.724 --> 07:11.897
worth or lack of worth of different betting systems for different casino games, and so on.

07:11.937 --> 07:19.510
And we have one on exercise that will be out in the July issue, which is all about

07:19.912 --> 07:21.915
four or five day a week workouts.

07:23.317 --> 07:27.222
You mentioned that the magazine had gotten away from what it was.

07:27.983 --> 07:29.485
Well, it got away from some element.

07:29.545 --> 07:35.274
But I mean, clearly this was on the one hand where it certainly was a writer's magazine.

07:35.614 --> 07:37.176
It also was a man's magazine.

07:37.276 --> 07:37.517
Correct.

07:38.097 --> 07:40.441
And maybe you could talk a little bit about that.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.263
I think it remained.

07:42.283 --> 07:44.146
It has always been a man's magazine.

07:44.226 --> 07:49.193
And I think there continued to be all through the 80s and 90s

07:49.510 --> 07:52.060
some very fine writing in the magazine.

07:52.120 --> 07:58.845
I just meant that the emphasis was, at certain times, the emphasis was away from

07:59.365 --> 08:02.969
certain things that I think are interesting and that had worked in the past.

08:03.129 --> 08:07.333
But here we are approaching the middle of the decade, and I wonder what... The end of the decade.

08:07.694 --> 08:09.736
The middle of the decade, the end of the decade.

08:10.537 --> 08:14.221
And I wonder what it means today to be a men's magazine.

08:14.341 --> 08:16.383
Well, to be a men's magazine or to be a man?

08:17.164 --> 08:17.745
Well, either one.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.465
That's from both.

08:18.485 --> 08:19.386
Why not?

08:19.406 --> 08:25.573
Well, I think that... I actually think there's kind of a little resurrection of confidence among men.

08:25.813 --> 08:28.596
I think that the depth of the...

08:29.099 --> 08:51.006
despair and everybody beating up on men and men being made to feel you know guilty for being men i think some of that is beginning to fade and uh and uh men and and a number of women realize that you know hey men are men and they're not women someone said that the the model of the of the

08:51.678 --> 08:54.882
The sensitive man, you know, is like a woman with a penis.

08:55.883 --> 09:05.674
And the fact is, as everyone who's ever raised children knows, and as people who've been married, been around for a while, know that men and women are different.

09:06.375 --> 09:14.164
And men certainly understand that women are different, and I think women are beginning to understand that men are different.

09:14.865 --> 09:19.431
And guys, they're going to watch the football game, and they're going to look at pretty girls.

09:19.771 --> 09:21.533
That doesn't mean they're monsters.

09:22.070 --> 09:30.406
And men are not going to be totally comfortable revealing all their feelings and crying and all that stuff.

09:32.009 --> 09:42.289
They can be attentive and not boorish, but there's a certain amount of, you know...

09:42.758 --> 09:45.461
old-fashioned man-ness that's going to continue.

09:46.082 --> 09:48.385
And I think people are getting a little support for that.

09:49.025 --> 09:52.389
How important would you say your hard news background is?

09:53.030 --> 09:57.135
Well, I think it's very helpful because a magazine like Esquire is really a journalistic magazine.

09:58.156 --> 10:12.293
And it's a topical magazine, so that you have to try to keep the magazine focusing on those newsworthy things, not chasing after the news magazines per se,

10:12.543 --> 10:15.868
or the newspapers, but to do topical journalism.

10:15.908 --> 10:20.875
That's also always been part of the Esquire tradition.

10:20.895 --> 10:27.305
But, I mean, certainly when you were at Newsweek, you know, I mean, it was deadline reporting.

10:28.066 --> 10:34.556
Yeah, except that at Newsweek, we did an awful lot of what we used to call sociology stories.

10:35.036 --> 10:40.204
But we did, God, we did a cover on The New Man in the mid-'70s.

10:40.522 --> 10:42.567
May he rest in peace.

10:43.209 --> 10:51.330
But Newsweek pioneered a kind of social reporting, and so I'm very comfortable doing this.

10:51.390 --> 10:54.919
And then at New York Magazine, we did all the trends, stories, and stuff.

10:55.557 --> 10:58.401
So I think it's all continuing.

10:58.421 --> 11:07.655
I read a number of pieces recently, one most recently in the Washington Post about this whole concept of the celebrity, the star editor.

11:07.996 --> 11:08.737
Yeah.

11:08.757 --> 11:19.092
And I wonder how you feel about being, I mean, what do you, I guess I'm going about this in a... I don't believe it.

11:19.112 --> 11:24.400
Well, certainly you must feel that you are expected to bring some kind of a personal...

11:24.785 --> 11:29.690
or to imprint some kind of personal brand on the... Yeah, but I think that that was always true.

11:29.750 --> 11:34.074
It's just that people didn't know the names of those who were imprinting the brand.

11:34.695 --> 11:44.424
You know, I mean, I think every editor has to have a point of view, and the terrible term vision is used all the time, particularly in the advertising world.

11:44.904 --> 11:48.648
But the fact is you have to have a pretty good idea of what the magazine should be.

11:49.128 --> 11:51.771
Otherwise, you don't know what to put in and what to leave out.

11:52.055 --> 11:56.099
You know, you have to have the standards of judgment.

11:56.119 --> 12:10.452
I mean, I really wonder if the, I mean, I'm not asking you to comment on this necessarily, but Tina Brown leaves Vanity Fair, and Vanity Fair, they say, loses its buzz or whatever.

12:11.273 --> 12:18.139
And then she goes to The New Yorker, and, you know, personally, I'm not crazy about what she's done at The New Yorker.

12:18.159 --> 12:21.943
I detest the covers that she's been doing, and...

12:22.278 --> 12:26.964
But in any case, is it Tina Brown that people are buying?

12:27.124 --> 12:29.547
Or is it a rejuvenation?

12:29.567 --> 12:30.488
Well, that's a good question.

12:30.528 --> 12:33.772
I mean, I think in reality people are buying the magazine.

12:34.633 --> 12:43.484
And despite all the publicity, I think only a fraction of magazine readers know the name of the editor of the magazine.

12:44.145 --> 12:50.833
And you can have the most publicity that it's possible for a human being to achieve.

12:51.269 --> 12:56.714
And if the magazine doesn't have good articles in it, good covers, good stuff, it's not going to succeed.

12:59.656 --> 13:05.862
There is an element, certainly in the late 80s and 90s, of this kind of personality stuff.

13:08.084 --> 13:09.665
I guess it's part of modern life.

13:09.685 --> 13:19.774
It's sort of the anchorman syndrome imposed on magazines, as if the nature of the...

13:20.311 --> 13:26.419
Evening newscast is really shaped by the personality of the anchor, which isn't really the case.

13:27.461 --> 13:28.582
It's the presentation.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.968
Anyway, I just think it's this year's flavor.

13:34.330 --> 13:42.081
I guess I know writing for newspapers, the vital signs for me are you can measure them almost within days.

13:42.862 --> 13:45.185
If you screw up, you hear from people.

13:45.506 --> 13:45.846
Yeah.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.329
Or you don't hear anything.

13:47.689 --> 13:48.591
Or you don't hear anything.

13:48.631 --> 13:57.988
And you love it when they... If you have something that people consider outrageous or wrong, you'll hear from them.

13:58.248 --> 14:01.354
But the real indicator is if you don't hear anything.

14:01.958 --> 14:06.287
That means it's just going out there into the void and nobody cares much.

14:06.307 --> 14:06.507
Right.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.411
I consider these the vital signs.

14:08.471 --> 14:14.964
Now, in your business, I guess the primary vital sign is sales and advertising.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.307
Yeah, but that works in different ways.

14:16.367 --> 14:20.575
In other words, there's an immediate kind of sign, which is newsstand sales.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.615
I mean, that's the first frontier.

14:24.676 --> 14:32.764
And if more people are buying the magazine, that's usually a better sign than a fewer people are buying.

14:32.784 --> 14:49.380
It's not a definitive sign, but it's an early indicator because most magazines are primarily subscription magazines, and the impact of a new editor or a new editorial presentation can take two years or more

14:49.850 --> 14:53.035
three years to work its way to the subscription file.

14:53.736 --> 14:58.624
People have to renew and they have to actively like it or actively dislike it.

14:59.164 --> 15:05.134
And those subscription things tend to move in a relatively glacial way.

15:05.735 --> 15:07.598
Newstand sales are more immediate.

15:07.658 --> 15:12.285
People have to put their hands in their pocket and pull out $3 or $2.50 or whatever.

15:12.325 --> 15:15.570
And if they like something, they will buy it.

15:16.276 --> 15:17.538
So that's a sign.

15:17.618 --> 15:20.441
The letters to the editor are often a sign.

15:20.641 --> 15:36.821
And also, the one that I use a lot is that if you're going around, if you find people commenting on individual articles, not saying, oh, the magazine looks great, but saying, I really love Gary Will's article on Nixon.

15:36.981 --> 15:40.445
I really love Lynn Darling's article on Adulterer.

15:40.605 --> 15:43.549
I really love Pete Hamill's article on Mike Tyson.

15:43.985 --> 15:44.726
whatever it is.

15:44.927 --> 15:48.734
I really love John Taylor's article about repressed memories.

15:49.575 --> 15:56.909
And if you have different people citing different articles, many of them from the same issue, that's a pretty good sign.

15:56.929 --> 15:59.534
That's great, isn't it?

15:59.574 --> 16:04.002
And I've been hearing that from the time my first issue came out, which was

16:04.505 --> 16:07.350
And I'm looking at the covers.

16:07.531 --> 16:08.993
I have about a half a dozen here.

16:09.755 --> 16:13.462
And, you know, there's a good sampling of cheesecake, we say.

16:13.842 --> 16:14.804
And that's great.

16:15.165 --> 16:17.890
But if you look at the marquee on the right,

16:18.241 --> 16:18.782
Exactly.

16:18.802 --> 16:20.103
You look at the names of the writers.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.145
Mike Lupica, John DeLillo.

16:22.405 --> 16:28.771
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of really good magazine writers and fiction people in there.

16:28.831 --> 16:31.093
So, I mean, these are popular offerings.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.595
Tell me about the cover.

16:32.615 --> 16:33.556
I mean, how do you decide?

16:34.777 --> 16:38.901
Tell me about the... Well, a cover should be a poster.

16:38.921 --> 16:43.125
It should be relatively... I mean, it should be a clean, simple image.

16:43.225 --> 16:47.809
Sometimes you can have some additional cover lines as we have to marquee the

16:48.481 --> 17:01.006
writers, but basically it should be a simple thing, and the cover headline should be a good, clean, direct, short headline that gives you a pretty good idea of what it's about.

17:01.787 --> 17:05.414
Now, have you gotten the July one and the Christie Brinkley one?

17:05.575 --> 17:07.719
No, I'm supposed to get it tomorrow.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.763
It's a meeting issue, and we've got...

17:09.862 --> 17:18.675
Christie Brinkley, on the beach, and she's got, across her chest, Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy.

17:18.775 --> 17:20.157
I was told to ask you about this.

17:20.177 --> 17:21.739
I haven't received it yet.

17:21.839 --> 17:26.886
Drop that book, which is a little joke, and pick up ours, you know, some reason.

17:27.407 --> 17:35.439
But basically, the covers have been direct, simple, poster-ish things.

17:35.559 --> 17:38.383
Tom Cruise, the...

17:38.819 --> 17:44.687
Claudia Schiffer and David Copperfield, Lyle Lovett, Sex and the Married Man, and so on.

17:47.070 --> 17:50.014
So that's my sense about covers.

17:50.034 --> 17:51.315
They shouldn't be complicated.

17:51.355 --> 17:57.904
They should directly communicate with the reader, and they should say, pick me up.

17:58.225 --> 17:59.326
That's their main thing.

17:59.386 --> 18:00.668
They should say, pick me up.

18:01.469 --> 18:02.230
I'm interesting.

18:02.270 --> 18:03.932
You want to look at me.

18:04.503 --> 18:05.707
That's what a cover should do.

18:05.888 --> 18:08.838
Now, the circulation was what when you took over?

18:08.898 --> 18:10.563
Circulation hasn't changed terribly.

18:10.784 --> 18:16.403
The circulation is about the monthly...

18:17.142 --> 18:20.068
Total is about three-quarters of a million.

18:20.088 --> 18:20.789
Do you have a goal?

18:21.751 --> 18:36.298
Well, you see, the thing in magazine publishing, you don't necessarily want to increase the absolute size of the circulation, but you'd like to be able to charge more for it or to get people to renew their issues more regularly.

18:36.751 --> 18:41.859
So the goal is not necessarily to increase, but it's to enrich that circulation.

18:41.879 --> 18:46.667
And, of course, I guess for the advertising numbers to go up as well.

18:46.707 --> 18:50.854
Well, that's an important thing, and we're going to have a very big September issue.

18:51.796 --> 18:54.039
That's going to be the biggest issue in five years.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.343
Now, who's the enemy for you, GQ?

18:56.704 --> 18:58.246
Well, it's different.

18:58.266 --> 19:03.535
You know, the direct business advertising industry,

19:04.949 --> 19:25.776
challenger is gq um the um in terms of readership uh we feel that we're competing with the new yorker and vanity fair and magazines like that uh in other words general interest

19:26.060 --> 19:31.309
magazines that have good provocative articles and good writers in them.

19:31.329 --> 19:37.979
Have there been any studies to indicate how many magazines your typical reader is willing to buy?

19:37.999 --> 19:43.849
I mean, if I subscribe to Esquire, does that mean I'm likely to quit on, you know,

19:43.829 --> 19:44.630
I don't know.

19:44.730 --> 19:46.713
That's an interesting question.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.914
I've never quite heard that.

19:48.375 --> 19:54.723
I'm wondering because, you know, I get books by the ton, of course, because I read it.

19:55.283 --> 20:06.177
I think most people take... The way most magazine readership works, as I understand it, is a lot of people will take a news magazine.

20:07.178 --> 20:07.879
They'll take...

20:08.821 --> 20:18.716
a magazine that has, if they have a special interest in it, like a backpacking magazine or a golf or a tennis magazine or a car magazine.

20:18.896 --> 20:32.456
And then they'll take one or perhaps more general interest magazine, The New Yorker or Esquire or Vanity Fair or in this area, New York Magazine.

20:33.137 --> 20:37.343
And out of that mix, so that

20:37.930 --> 20:39.833
people will subscribe to three or four.

20:40.794 --> 20:45.020
Of course, some people subscribe to ten, and some people subscribe to only one.

20:45.060 --> 20:59.500
But when I've done focus groups, I often find that people will subscribe to at least one or two general interest magazines, and almost everyone will have one special interest, perhaps one.

20:59.918 --> 21:04.202
Condé Nast Traveler or Travel and Leisure or something like that.

21:04.462 --> 21:09.087
Because, you know, I'm an old journalist who used to take notes.

21:10.328 --> 21:10.728
Yes.

21:10.748 --> 21:13.391
And I found that it made me pay attention better.

21:13.411 --> 21:14.232
Absolutely.

21:14.252 --> 21:17.915
You know, and I'm taping and... You're never learning how to keep it all in your head for half an hour?

21:17.935 --> 21:18.636
Really, exactly.

21:18.796 --> 21:21.158
You can run in the bathroom and scribble it all down.

21:21.559 --> 21:21.819
Yeah.

21:21.859 --> 21:27.985
When I started, I prided myself on being able, I thought, to maintain...

21:28.707 --> 21:32.828
pretty accurately about a half hour's worth of

21:33.061 --> 22:02.933
conversation and hold it for exactly and I also find with the tapes you say well it's on tape so I have to worry about it but I'm sure we covered this the subject of male sensibility but we're talking about men we added to the male sensibility totally do you want to talk about that yeah what I said was that I think there's more confidence on the part of men I think you know men in their 30s now

22:04.043 --> 22:07.226
say, which is our sort of target reader.

22:09.148 --> 22:18.797
They're not like their fathers, but they're not going to be Alan Alda and Phil Donahue wrapped up in one.

22:19.177 --> 22:22.520
They're not like their fathers, and can you be just a little bit more specific?

22:22.980 --> 22:29.106
Well, I think, for example, when my father was my age, he was really a middle-aged man.

22:30.327 --> 22:32.329
And, you know, he...

22:32.613 --> 22:35.656
He sort of dressed a certain way and acted a certain way.

22:36.356 --> 22:46.224
And now men keep very active, a lot of them do anyway, can have very active lives into their 70s.

22:46.945 --> 22:52.069
People play tennis and they travel and they get remarried and all that stuff.

22:52.169 --> 22:56.673
It's not the idea that when you're 45 or something, you're on the big slope down.

22:58.675 --> 23:02.518
And I think that that's a big change.

23:03.005 --> 23:11.647
that the active life of someone can range from, you know, 20 to 70, not 20 to 45 or 20 to 50.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.732
So that's a big difference.

23:13.752 --> 23:18.263
And I think men certainly have learned about women's...

23:18.749 --> 23:42.327
sensitivity to certain things and i think that uh you know well brought up men don't behave the way some people used to in the past and of course i think you did address yourself to the to the the the era the recently deceased era of the the purported sensitive yeah i mean but some of the some of that had a certain benefit i mean if people don't sit in business meetings and

23:43.015 --> 23:45.018
tell tits and ass jokes and stuff.

23:45.038 --> 23:51.147
I mean, there's no harm to certainly appreciating curbing some of that stuff.

23:51.167 --> 23:52.589
That's not a problem.

23:52.609 --> 23:55.113
And so that's to the good.

23:55.213 --> 24:02.003
But at the same time, I think people realize that, hey, guy's going to watch football and guy's going to, you know, look at

24:02.978 --> 24:05.242
girls behind and they're just going to do it.

24:05.703 --> 24:06.906
They're never going to stop doing it.

24:06.926 --> 24:08.769
I may not use that quote exactly.

24:08.789 --> 24:09.431
Well, you know what I mean.

24:09.451 --> 24:10.773
They're not going to stop doing it.

24:10.833 --> 24:14.320
And there's no basic reason for them to stop doing it.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.426
And they shouldn't feel tortured about it.

24:17.446 --> 24:22.877
And I think that they're increasingly, people are coming around to that, you know.

24:23.245 --> 24:49.506
here's here's a question and let's work with it a bit okay because this this particular piece and by the way i i told peter that uh i'm not precluding doing another piece for my my little syndicated newspaper that's fine uh but it won't be the same piece uh and maybe we can conclude with some some specific comment on writers and books and things uh which would make it more saleable to my clients because it is a literary column that i write

24:49.807 --> 24:54.234
But immediately, you are a New Yorker born and bred.

24:55.496 --> 25:04.731
Do you bring the perspective of a New Yorker to the magazine, or do you feel that you have a more?

25:04.751 --> 25:06.053
Let's just play with that for a while.

25:06.133 --> 25:07.495
Everybody's a creature of their...

25:07.930 --> 25:30.613
upbringing to how does it influence the product to how does it influence the product to let's say I'm not I'm not a good I'm not a good judge of that I mean I've basically worked in in magazines for 30 years and I've worked for national magazines before and I worked for a city and regional magazine but I never

25:30.914 --> 25:39.923
When I worked on Newsweek, I never thought of myself as a New Yorker working on Newsweek, although a number of the editors were from New York.

25:39.943 --> 25:44.507
And when I worked on New York Magazine, I was one of the few New Yorkers on New York Magazine.

25:44.527 --> 25:49.072
All the editors were from Texas and Chicago and everywhere.

25:49.092 --> 25:53.035
There were only a few of us Manhattanites who actually worked on the magazine.

25:53.856 --> 25:57.900
So there I felt like a New Yorker because I was working on a magazine called New York.

25:58.218 --> 26:03.564
But here I don't feel particularly geographically or culturally bound.

26:04.265 --> 26:23.668
I mean, I'm not from Paris, but I think that I've got a pretty broad view and a pretty eclectic set of tastes, and I don't think it's geographically defined.

26:23.935 --> 26:25.177
Good.

26:25.558 --> 26:30.928
And then maybe we can just talk... I have been to the Hamptons.

26:31.530 --> 26:33.193
But I live in Connecticut.

26:33.213 --> 26:33.594
There you go.

26:33.614 --> 26:34.696
Where do you live in Connecticut?

26:34.956 --> 26:35.597
Up in Reading.

26:36.479 --> 26:37.782
What's your paper up there?

26:37.962 --> 26:42.130
Well, they get the...

26:42.548 --> 26:44.451
I guess they call it the Connecticut Post.

26:44.471 --> 26:45.974
Yeah, well, that's the one I'm trying to get into.

26:46.054 --> 26:52.464
The Danbury News Times is the big paper up there and the Bridgeport Post, which they call it.

26:52.484 --> 26:53.967
The Connecticut Post, right.

26:54.167 --> 27:02.481
And then we have a nice little weekly called the Reading Pilot, which is put out by an asset called Acorn Press that puts out.

27:02.917 --> 27:07.482
weeklies in Easton, Connecticut, Weston, Connecticut, and Ridgefield.

27:08.283 --> 27:10.706
Very literate paper.

27:11.146 --> 27:16.493
Again, you talked about making Esquire, once again, a writer's magazine.

27:16.553 --> 27:21.638
Tell me a little bit about your philosophy, your feelings towards good literature and that kind of stuff.

27:21.658 --> 27:23.460
People read magazines to read writers.

27:24.802 --> 27:29.027
To relate to what you said earlier about celebrity editors and stuff.

27:29.047 --> 27:30.949
I don't think people really read magazines.

27:31.790 --> 28:00.143
to discern the editor's touch I think they read magazines to read writers and successful editors are the ones who can attract strong writers and keep them and give them projects that showcase their talents and connect them with stories that are going to be provocative and interesting so the concept of a magazine without writers is an anomaly even the news magazines which used to

28:00.680 --> 28:11.453
pride themselves on basically being written by committees of editors, have in the last 10 years broken out the names of writers and had more columnists and stuff.

28:12.054 --> 28:18.942
I mean, an effort to give the magazines more individual voice and more identity.

28:19.883 --> 28:21.886
So that's a trend that's universal.

28:22.266 --> 28:27.092
A magazine like Esquire, you should read Esquire to read really good books.

28:27.545 --> 28:35.876
reporting and fiction and topical journalism by very, very skillful writers.

28:35.976 --> 28:42.004
Now, we have a big piece coming out in the August issue, Norman Mailer on Madonna.

28:43.166 --> 28:52.438
Norman Mailer and Madonna have met not since Marx and Jefferson had breakfast together, as there's been such a meeting.

28:53.212 --> 28:56.736
Was this a commission piece or something that Norman came up with, I wonder?

28:56.756 --> 28:58.578
Oh, no, it's an original piece.

28:58.618 --> 29:00.800
Did he suggest it or did you propose it?

29:00.840 --> 29:10.491
No, we proposed it to him because after Madonna appeared on David Letterman, everybody was dumping on her.

29:10.812 --> 29:21.143
And Norman remarked to Liz Smith at a party that he thought that she was fine and she was being taken advantage of, and we read that.

29:21.629 --> 29:31.061
and asked him whether he wanted to do something with her, and she turned out to be very excited at the idea, and so they've gotten together, and that will be out in August.

29:31.482 --> 29:32.483
Oh, that sounds good.

29:32.583 --> 29:33.424
What's ahead on it?

29:33.945 --> 29:34.986
Mailer on Madonna.

29:35.287 --> 29:35.587
Good.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.588
I'll put that in the piece.

29:36.728 --> 29:37.189
It sounds pretty good.

29:37.209 --> 29:43.177
Yeah, it'll be out in August, and then I have a piece in this July issue that you're going to get, When Nixon Died.

29:43.197 --> 29:45.219
We got Gary Wills to write about him.

29:45.239 --> 29:47.643
I don't want to read any other piece.

29:47.663 --> 29:51.147
You know, I don't want to read just another Nixon piece, because it's going to be in the...

29:51.346 --> 29:54.850
in the news magazines and everywhere, but I'm interested in Gary Wills.

29:54.870 --> 29:57.393
Yeah, I just interviewed him two weeks ago, as a matter of fact.

29:57.413 --> 30:01.779
And we had John Keegan write about D-Day in the June issue.

30:01.879 --> 30:02.620
I love Keegan.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.241
I love him.

30:03.361 --> 30:03.801
He's great.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.724
I'm looking at one of his books right here.

30:05.744 --> 30:09.769
Clinton liked it so much that he invited him to dinner at the White House to talk about it.

30:09.789 --> 30:13.874
Well, you couldn't ask for a better person to learn about warfare from.

30:14.314 --> 30:20.762
So what we're trying to do is, you know, to bring a writer, and we've got Bella working on a piece for us.

30:21.383 --> 30:24.332
And a bunch of good young writers as well.

30:24.392 --> 30:35.646
But I mean, the point is to bring, to combine a distinguished writer with a subject, and then you got something.

30:36.537 --> 30:38.740
So that's the game, and that's what we're trying to do.

30:38.760 --> 30:47.673
And I think it's important to point out that while it is a men's magazine, you do not disdain.

30:48.594 --> 30:51.038
You have women who write.

30:51.058 --> 30:51.799
Oh, absolutely.

30:51.819 --> 30:53.622
Certainly fiction as well as all the other.

30:53.822 --> 30:55.484
Women readers and women editors.

30:55.604 --> 30:56.065
That's great.

30:56.165 --> 31:01.633
But it's a men's magazine that's of interest to men and to women who write.

31:01.613 --> 31:26.828
who they share their lives with esquire has always been hospitable to wonderful women writing by women and uh and always will be well this is the 60th anniversary of the magazine right november well we're sailing on towards the millennium and uh and you feel that uh the tradition is strong and continues and we're bringing it back we're bringing that's great
