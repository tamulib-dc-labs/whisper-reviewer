WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:04.788
Go ahead.

00:04.808 --> 00:08.714
Well, as we agree, it's impossible to serve two monsters.

00:08.734 --> 00:16.365
And it would have been impossible to write this book if I hadn't taken two years unpaid leave from my teaching.

00:16.385 --> 00:17.727
And this was at where?

00:18.248 --> 00:22.634
I teach at Oxford at the sole remaining woman's college, St.

00:22.654 --> 00:23.596
Hilda's College.

00:23.616 --> 00:25.218
Oxford figures prominently in my book.

00:25.599 --> 00:27.782
Do you know Colin Franklin?

00:27.802 --> 00:28.863
I never know anybody.

00:28.924 --> 00:31.287
I've lived a very quiet life.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.664
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:33.586 --> 00:42.018
Well, it was very unpopular things to do in college because the English form of democracy is that nobody should have advantages anybody else doesn't have.

00:42.699 --> 00:47.345
But I was just determined to take off that time.

00:47.446 --> 00:48.207
And when was this?

00:48.227 --> 00:51.211
This was from about 1990 to 92.

00:51.231 --> 00:54.696
And had you started the project?

00:54.856 --> 01:00.244
I'd just started it, and after I went back into full-time teaching,

01:00.477 --> 01:05.105
I did, you know, two years of more work than rebellion.

01:05.586 --> 01:10.755
But Oxford, well, the bulk of the book was done in the two years unpaid leave.

01:10.775 --> 01:13.560
But then... The writing end of it or the actual research?

01:13.761 --> 01:14.342
The writing.

01:14.582 --> 01:15.824
The writing and research.

01:15.905 --> 01:17.828
I sort of do the two together because...

01:19.343 --> 01:23.629
Well, it just works for me to do research when, to write when the research is done.

01:23.689 --> 01:25.893
And I think that access to materials was good.

01:25.913 --> 01:27.014
I think you're in the right place.

01:27.295 --> 01:27.635
Oh, yes.

01:27.876 --> 01:29.098
You didn't really have to do a good job.

01:29.158 --> 01:30.860
Well, I did come to America.

01:30.900 --> 01:40.915
There are Charlotte Bronte materials in America, but the main materials are at the Harvest Parsonage, at the Bronte Parsonage Museum, and it's not so easy because it's still very inaccessible.

01:41.195 --> 01:43.399
It takes five hours by train from Oxford.

01:43.419 --> 01:43.579
Really?

01:44.065 --> 01:47.288
You can fly across the Atlantic.

01:47.368 --> 01:50.752
I know you can fly across the country.

01:50.832 --> 01:53.615
Yes, so it's not so accessible.

01:54.155 --> 01:59.480
But one advantage is that Oxford vacations are long.

02:00.101 --> 02:03.304
It's called the long, the summer vacation.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.648
And then our terms are only eight weeks.

02:07.028 --> 02:12.013
So I've always been able to, in that way, my post hasn't been as bad as some people's.

02:12.618 --> 02:17.324
Every eight weeks, you have a six-week vacation, which is long enough to write a chapter.

02:17.824 --> 02:19.987
So let's use this as an entry point, then.

02:20.487 --> 02:20.667
Yes.

02:21.649 --> 02:30.819
Because there have been a number of studies written on the subject, what really persuaded you that this was a subject at then?

02:30.839 --> 02:33.883
Well, in a way, I began this book by accident.

02:34.133 --> 02:51.352
I have written critical biographies before, and because I'm very interested in the links between life and work, the transmutation of life into work, and therefore I've particularly chosen autobiographical subjects, I'm also interested in women writers and women's lives.

02:52.053 --> 03:00.462
I was then to write a book called Lives for Women, which was then to be a series of short biographies... Explain, pardon me, just to say autobiographical subjects.

03:00.543 --> 03:03.647
Yes, I've chosen, I've written about T.S.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.671
Eliot and Virginia Woolf and now Charlotte Bronte.

03:06.691 --> 03:19.569
But using their own... Well, because they are very autobiographical, and there are drafts of their material, it's quite, their lives, the links between their lives and works are interesting.

03:19.589 --> 03:21.211
It's a very interesting way that you do this.

03:21.271 --> 03:24.255
You're writing as a biographer, but writing about...

03:24.843 --> 03:27.606
autobiographical subject, which I think is very interesting.

03:27.706 --> 03:30.268
So that you can get very close to the creative act.

03:30.288 --> 03:36.595
But I do think when you write about writers, one's got to see that the work was the center of their lives.

03:36.955 --> 03:41.940
And to skirt the work is, I think, a falsification of what was so intensely important to them.

03:41.960 --> 03:51.610
And I think it's terribly interesting to get close, you get very close to what Henry James called the private life, which is almost the set-apart life of the writer, something

03:52.147 --> 03:54.390
quite distinct from the public appearances.

03:54.510 --> 03:58.155
I mean, in Charlotte Bronte, her public appearances were very mousy.

03:58.576 --> 04:08.048
I mean, she had to conform in the middle of the 19th century to a construct of womanhood as very quiet, very modest, very mousy.

04:08.749 --> 04:13.215
But if you listen to the voice of her writings, she's the antithesis of this.

04:13.235 --> 04:18.863
She's volcanic, fiery, passionate, and very professional.

04:19.383 --> 04:23.330
It's very important that I think that she is a professional wife.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.251
She is professional.

04:24.812 --> 04:26.375
At that point.

04:26.395 --> 04:38.094
And that she did partly through games she had with her brother when they were children, in that they, at the Howard Partridge Museum, they had minute little booklets which they invented together.

04:38.735 --> 04:40.358
They had fantasies together.

04:40.839 --> 04:42.922
And they were very professionally done.

04:42.942 --> 04:45.306
They were playing a game of publication where they had

04:46.045 --> 04:50.049
title pages and contents and they signed their work.

04:50.069 --> 04:53.733
You know, they were very concerned with being writers in the future.

04:53.774 --> 04:55.295
Amazing, isn't it?

04:55.315 --> 04:55.576
It is.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.717
Especially a lot of mothers.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.520
Yes, no mother, no mother.

04:59.540 --> 05:04.085
What was in this father that motivated all of these?

05:04.165 --> 05:13.035
I think that it was almost for the girls, for the Bronte women, it was almost in secret from their father.

05:13.075 --> 05:16.018
He knew nothing about their writing until

05:16.370 --> 05:26.729
Charlotte Bronte went to confess it after the great success of Jane Eyre and she realised he was getting very close to home and Jane Eyre was circulating in Yorkshire and people were talking.

05:27.490 --> 05:33.241
But he really, like a traditional Victorian father, really only took interest in his son's development.

05:33.521 --> 05:39.272
His son was very brilliant, very talented, but somehow went off the rails.

05:39.860 --> 05:40.621
It happened.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.622
It happened.

05:41.703 --> 05:43.846
You mentioned the James family.

05:43.866 --> 05:49.093
I mean, you had William and Henry, who were wonderful, and then you had Alice, who was brilliant.

05:49.213 --> 05:53.179
Yes, brilliant, but not... But then you had those two other sons, which you totally rejected.

05:53.359 --> 05:54.941
Well, I think that's a different story.

05:55.001 --> 06:04.114
I mean, that's a very interesting story in that those two youngest ones went to war, went to the Civil War, and didn't regret them, encouraged by their father.

06:04.134 --> 06:06.878
And their father let off the two older ones.

06:06.898 --> 06:08.280
And the younger one, I believe,

06:08.530 --> 06:13.497
He hated it and wanted to come home, and his father said, you stick it and be a man.

06:14.058 --> 06:15.720
I mean, it must have destroyed them.

06:16.521 --> 06:22.269
There's a wonderful, I haven't read it yet, I don't know if it's wonderful instead of the reviews, but there's a biography of Henry Sr.

06:22.289 --> 06:23.211
that's just been published.

06:23.231 --> 06:24.593
Oh, I would love to read that.

06:24.713 --> 06:25.814
Ferris Strauss.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.316
Oh, I must read it.

06:27.336 --> 06:29.700
I just got my review copy of it last week.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.143
Oh, I will get that, because I'm very keen on the dream.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.525
Really strong review on me.

06:33.961 --> 06:38.408
You know Justin Kaplan is doing a biography of William right now, would you change?

06:38.628 --> 06:39.089
Yes.

06:39.109 --> 06:41.453
This is about a half a mile from here, isn't it?

06:42.855 --> 06:44.718
I'm sorry, you don't mind jumping around a little bit?

06:44.758 --> 06:46.180
No, not at all, not at all.

06:46.220 --> 06:52.269
But to get back on track here where you were about your decision to write about him.

06:52.289 --> 06:54.893
Oh yes, sorry, I didn't answer that question.

06:55.013 --> 06:59.480
I was going to write a book called Life for Women because I wanted to get away from the big tome.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.542
I didn't believe in that.

07:01.163 --> 07:02.845
so-called definitive biography.

07:02.885 --> 07:03.846
I think it's an illusion.

07:03.866 --> 07:04.587
Well, there probably isn't one.

07:04.687 --> 07:10.555
There's no such thing as definitive biography, I believe, but it's a delusion of the marketplace.

07:10.735 --> 07:12.437
There's no last word on any life.

07:12.597 --> 07:22.449
I think when you enter the canon, as Charlotte and I certainly have, you have to have a new interpretation every generation.

07:22.469 --> 07:23.370
Every generation.

07:23.390 --> 07:25.933
Because what I've tried to do is write a biography.

07:26.074 --> 07:28.116
Well, I'm interested in women's lives and seeing them

07:28.450 --> 07:34.016
from the perspective of right now, where we're interested in strength, you know, and resilience and resource.

07:34.657 --> 07:44.607
And I was going to do then a series of shorter biographies where I would just try and distill something very central.

07:46.329 --> 07:56.280
And then when I began working on Charlotte Bronte, that was the first of a series, I began to see that I was seeing her differently and treating her differently from previous

07:56.665 --> 08:00.430
They're excellent biographies of Charlotte Bronte.

08:00.450 --> 08:05.116
She's been well served, starting with Mrs. Gaskell in the 19th century.

08:05.837 --> 08:07.500
She was commissioned, actually.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.963
Mrs. Gaskell was commissioned by the family.

08:11.865 --> 08:13.748
But she wrote a wonderful biography.

08:13.768 --> 08:14.689
It'll live always.

08:14.749 --> 08:17.593
But it was Charlotte Bronte for the Victorians.

08:17.911 --> 08:22.180
What do they call a Valentine with Valentine's Day coming next week?

08:22.240 --> 08:36.291
No, no, I think that that doesn't do justice to the fact that she does show a living woman she knew, but she wanted to bring forward the visible Charlotte Bronte who was

08:36.878 --> 08:40.723
quietly suffering, sort of shivering in the shadow of tombstones.

08:40.783 --> 08:43.106
It was a picture of a life of desolation.

08:43.206 --> 08:45.229
I'm actually quoting this in Guskell's words.

08:45.489 --> 08:47.311
She begins with a row of tombstones.

08:47.391 --> 08:49.734
And the Victorians, of course, relished death.

08:50.275 --> 08:54.120
And she's showing, when she shows you this row of tombstones, i.e.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.984
one Bronte died after another, this is all true.

08:57.605 --> 09:03.332
And she's saying, all right, I'm taking the scene for a tragedy about a doomed family.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.755
And this was Bronte legend.

09:05.937 --> 09:09.362
that developed this doomed family roaming over the moors.

09:09.863 --> 09:13.589
And right up till now, it's got tremendous hold on people's imagination.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.653
The whole thing is a romantic myth.

09:17.134 --> 09:27.811
And what I want to do, the vogue now in Bronte scholarship is to actually be much more realistic and down to earth, to see these as people who weren't so lonely.

09:27.831 --> 09:33.379
They were living in the middle of Yorkshire, and they were very class-ridden.

09:33.764 --> 09:37.253
Mr. Bronte changed his class in 10 years.

09:37.373 --> 09:40.121
He was an Irish peasant who became a gentleman.

09:40.161 --> 09:45.214
And they were very prickly, his daughters, about their status as the daughters of gentlemen.

09:45.715 --> 09:48.803
That's why that made them very tense when they went out as governesses.

09:49.120 --> 09:54.788
It's now considered all wrong to separate them from the context of the society in which they lived.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.550
You mentioned a new interpretation.

09:56.831 --> 10:00.736
I know one or two of the reviewers have said this is a revisionist biography.

10:00.756 --> 10:01.978
Do you accept that?

10:01.998 --> 10:05.683
I've been asked this before, and I'm not quite sure what's meant by the word revisionist.

10:05.703 --> 10:12.492
Nor do I, but this was a reviewer, it was either the New York Times or the Washington Post reviewer, I think, who used this expression.

10:12.812 --> 10:17.018
Well, does it mean that I'm offering a very different interpretation?

10:16.998 --> 10:42.043
Well, I am offering a different interpretation in that... But you don't necessarily accept that... Well, I think it... You see, I wouldn't accept it in that Mrs. Gaskell, I feel, did tell a great truth about Charlotte Brontë, and she's influenced all other biographies up to now, which is that this was a life of desolation and suffering, and she presented an idea, an image of pathos.

10:42.479 --> 10:45.524
And this was supposed to redeem the Victorian idea.

10:45.564 --> 10:52.595
The hostility to Charlotte Bronte, although she was extremely successful, she also boasts a lot of hostility because of her passion and vehement.

10:53.016 --> 10:55.740
The Victorians called her cause.

10:55.760 --> 11:01.129
Now, what I want to do is to bring forward the invisible Charlotte Bronte, the writer.

11:01.169 --> 11:05.135
I'm putting her work at the center of her life, and I'm also trying to open up the gaps.

11:05.716 --> 11:10.123
It's so easy to do a seamless biography because there are so many facts, but many

11:10.475 --> 11:12.819
papers were destroyed at the time of her death.

11:13.099 --> 11:19.729
I think it's very important to point out this expression, opening up the gaps you've used, and it's very important.

11:19.789 --> 11:26.780
You're not really trying to uncover new factual information about the woman and to any great, are you?

11:27.220 --> 11:27.861
Yes.

11:28.322 --> 11:35.513
One thing, for instance, is I've told in great detail a story of another relationship.

11:35.533 --> 11:38.237
I mean, she had two

11:38.605 --> 11:45.353
one might say loves in her life before her happy marriage to her father's purist.

11:45.373 --> 11:50.619
Well, first of all, what's well known is that she fell in love with a married man, her French teacher in Brussels.

11:51.160 --> 11:57.227
And that was a reckless, quite destructive love in some ways, but quite indefinable.

11:57.387 --> 12:02.473
I've tried to reinterpret that in that I don't think it falls into easy categories of crush or affair.

12:03.033 --> 12:07.178
I think it was very important that he recognised her genius and that he

12:07.985 --> 12:11.510
He offered to know her, and he refined her work.

12:13.113 --> 12:28.035
But I've told something new about the other relationship, which was a long relationship with her young publisher, George Smith, who was to become the preeminent publisher in the Victorian period, and he was obeying Prinsley.

12:28.335 --> 12:30.178
And the whole tone of that relationship

12:30.783 --> 12:32.985
Again, it's an indefinable relationship.

12:33.866 --> 12:35.588
Do you see any parallels at all?

12:35.608 --> 12:38.451
I mean, you know the Emily Dickinson story that we have.

12:38.471 --> 12:38.551
Yes.

12:38.571 --> 12:39.152
Yes, I do.

12:39.692 --> 12:54.147
And it just has almost the same kind of... Yes, because again, you see, with Emily Dickinson and what the man she called Martha, I mean, again, well, we know very much less about that, of course, but it's, I would say, an indefinable relationship.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.128
She wrote an awful lot of letters.

12:55.528 --> 12:56.469
She wrote her letters.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.052
She also, you see, like Charlotte Bronte adopts,

12:59.268 --> 13:01.991
a public persona, which she plays.

13:02.011 --> 13:10.620
I mean, her daisy persona is not terribly engaging to us in the 20th century because it feels very twee, you know, and I don't know if you know that English word.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.082
How would we spell that word?

13:12.282 --> 13:13.483
Twee.

13:13.804 --> 13:15.205
T-W-E-E in English.

13:15.305 --> 13:18.969
I could wrestle with that on my tape for hours.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.292
It's all coy and arch.

13:21.732 --> 13:24.695
It's not a tone that 20th century women use.

13:25.296 --> 13:29.140
And we've got to be sympathetic, I suppose, to 19th century women who

13:29.339 --> 13:32.605
had to play some of the games of their time.

13:33.085 --> 13:47.811
But, I mean, it's obviously a momentous volcanic relationship, and not important, except insofar as it provokes, obviously, very great poetry, and she's transforming it, whatever it was, into something marvelous.

13:47.831 --> 13:49.073
You don't mind my jumping around?

13:49.173 --> 13:50.115
Not at all.

13:50.348 --> 13:52.191
Because I make sense out of this.

13:52.211 --> 14:03.212
No, I think that it's terribly interesting that both Emily Dickinson, who was a great admirer of the Brontes, when I looked, I actually, here at Harvard in the, I don't know how to pronounce it, the Houghton Library?

14:03.252 --> 14:04.073
Houghton.

14:04.935 --> 14:05.436
Houghton.

14:05.456 --> 14:06.498
Houghton.

14:06.518 --> 14:09.804
In the Houghton Library where they have the Emily Dickinson page.

14:09.824 --> 14:10.365
Very nice, that's Houghton.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.890
They have the Emily Dickinson papers.

14:13.451 --> 14:20.664
I looked at her books, and she had everything the Brontes published, especially she admired Emily Brontes, of course, the poet.

14:21.285 --> 14:28.378
But I think that she felt the boldness of the Brontes, and I think she was even more daring in the way she broke up language.

14:28.438 --> 14:31.303
Did you go into the kids' room at the Houghton Library?

14:31.323 --> 14:31.464
No.

14:31.484 --> 14:32.826
They have a life mask of kids.

14:33.278 --> 14:35.040
I mean, which is very interesting.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.181
I mean, I get shivers.

14:36.241 --> 14:39.785
I mean, death masks are easy, but... Life masks.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.747
But this was a life mask taken.

14:41.767 --> 14:42.968
I mean, he died at 29.

14:43.228 --> 14:48.293
It was a remarkable collection of cute stuff right there.

14:48.313 --> 14:52.798
That was wonderful figures, because, of course, I worked there on the Eliot papers that I was working on.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.420
Figures very prominently in my book.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.842
Well, I'll tell you a little bit about it when we're done, if you'd like.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.023
Right, I would like to, yes.

14:58.043 --> 15:02.728
Because it really is about... Let's talk about the plantes again.

15:02.995 --> 15:08.060
Where were we?

15:08.100 --> 15:13.324
You were asking me what I added to... Well, what you hoped to add.

15:14.065 --> 15:18.529
And I think that this book is impossible without letters, right?

15:18.549 --> 15:20.210
I mean, letters are essential.

15:20.371 --> 15:29.539
And what you see, there isn't... I mean, one of the extraordinary things is that there isn't, as yet, a collected edition of Charlotte Bronte's letters.

15:29.959 --> 15:30.960
I mean, they were so...

15:31.210 --> 15:34.579
I mean, that's a whole scandal of the late 19th century.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.343
They were scattered far and wide.

15:37.065 --> 15:47.852
And it's been very hard to... The man she married, Arthur Bell Nichols, her father's purit, was terribly...

15:48.203 --> 15:53.190
came to a whole Bronte material close to the chest, and he disappeared into the wilds of Ireland.

15:53.210 --> 15:55.013
Well, that happens so often, doesn't it?

15:55.033 --> 15:57.657
I know, and he lived on and on into the century.

15:57.697 --> 15:58.778
He only died in 1906.

15:58.799 --> 16:02.644
And you think that stuff is missing, or you think it's very... Well, no, no, he did.

16:02.684 --> 16:06.049
He handed it over to a scholar adventurer who was a rogue.

16:06.069 --> 16:09.254
But you think a lot of it is missing?

16:09.274 --> 16:15.663
Well, papers were actually deliberately destroyed at the time of her death because she was thought of as course.

16:15.944 --> 16:17.586
And her close friends,

16:17.802 --> 16:21.407
Her two great women friends destroyed letters.

16:21.907 --> 16:26.914
Ellen Massey destroyed some, but she kept the bulk of them, and we're very lucky.

16:26.954 --> 16:31.940
But her feminist friend, Mary Taylor, destroyed a great deal of letters.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.163
So what do you think we lost in this?

16:34.283 --> 16:36.666
Well, I think I was trying to say about Mary Taylor.

16:37.848 --> 16:45.818
Mary Taylor was a woman who, from her adolescence, when she met Charlotte Bronte at school, was very concerned about the economic position of women.

16:46.186 --> 16:51.312
And I think that she and Charlotte Bronte would have had a feminist exchange.

16:52.073 --> 17:00.163
Mary Taylor wanted to found a business, and women couldn't found businesses in the 1830s, in England, 1840s, so she emigrated to New Zealand.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.086
She was one of the first immigrants.

17:02.687 --> 17:08.193
And she founded her business, made money, and came back and retired in England.

17:08.614 --> 17:11.097
But there was no way that...

17:11.566 --> 17:14.710
well, what was one going to do about this gap in Charlotte Bronte's life?

17:15.411 --> 17:20.638
Mary Taylor thought these were dangerous letters in 1855 when Charlotte Bronte died.

17:20.698 --> 17:23.802
And she later said she regretted destroying their correspondence.

17:24.243 --> 17:35.678
But what does remain, and what I have used, is that at the time Charlotte Bronte finished her most feminist novel, Shirley, which she sent to New Zealand to Mary Taylor.

17:35.918 --> 17:38.101
Mary Taylor does one letter's expense.

17:38.221 --> 17:39.463
Mary Taylor replies,

17:40.844 --> 17:42.967
She's actually in this novel.

17:43.247 --> 17:44.569
Her family's in this novel.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.212
And she says, you've got us exactly.

17:46.352 --> 17:47.353
I can see our home.

17:47.373 --> 17:54.965
She's depicted in this novel as a proto-feminist child, a rebellious child who's got thoughts her mother never thought.

17:55.806 --> 17:59.050
And she reveals to Charlotte she's writing a novel.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.893
And this novel survives.

18:01.794 --> 18:02.856
It was published.

18:03.597 --> 18:04.118
Miss Miles.

18:04.338 --> 18:06.301
And it's a very feminist novel.

18:06.802 --> 18:09.045
And it's been published.

18:09.228 --> 18:11.792
recently by Oxford University Press republished.

18:11.813 --> 18:13.095
How does it read?

18:13.576 --> 18:15.619
Well, I found it quite readable.

18:16.220 --> 18:21.289
It's not read in that Mary Taylor was an activist, a doer.

18:21.429 --> 18:23.012
She was a businesswoman.

18:23.413 --> 18:26.358
So she's not profound as Charlotte Bronte is.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.303
On the other hand, she gives a portrait of what it was like.

18:29.323 --> 18:33.210
She actually subtitles it life 60 years ago because it's only...

18:33.342 --> 18:55.671
eventually published in 1890 so she's writing about women's lives in the 1830s when she and charlotte were young so i've drawn on that novel to try and get an atmosphere of what she and charlotte were concerned about let's make a comment if we if we might it's important i mean the story is fascinating just even if she's not charlotte blonte i mean

18:56.275 --> 18:56.916
But she is.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.561
Let's talk a little bit about, you know, the importance of the writing, too.

19:01.621 --> 19:03.663
Are you going to say it isn't Charlotte Bronte?

19:05.005 --> 19:05.345
I'm sorry?

19:05.705 --> 19:08.388
Are you saying that that for a portrait isn't Charlotte Bronte?

19:08.408 --> 19:10.030
No, I'm saying it is, absolutely.

19:10.070 --> 19:13.334
But what makes it—no, no, no, I hope that wasn't suggested.

19:13.454 --> 19:18.840
No, I'm saying the fact that she's such—her work resonates to this day.

19:19.175 --> 19:25.885
You're talking about this other novel that you just read, and it's not so deep, but it retails.

19:25.905 --> 19:32.334
This particular woman, her work is probably not likely to survive through generations.

19:33.035 --> 19:35.659
Yes, Charles Brandt, of course, a much greater artist.

19:35.679 --> 19:38.723
Which really justifies this effort.

19:38.743 --> 19:40.646
I guess that's just a comment on my part.

19:40.987 --> 19:43.430
No, that's all right.

19:43.450 --> 19:48.237
But interestingly, her work has been republished, this particular novel, because

19:48.520 --> 19:57.450
Again, it speaks to... I mean, it was a novel published in 1890, and this is a century later, but it still does speak to women, I imagine.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.993
Right around the time Emily Dickinson's stuff is coming out, too.

20:01.014 --> 20:02.795
You know, interesting.

20:02.815 --> 20:03.937
It's 1890.

20:03.957 --> 20:04.277
Is it?

20:04.317 --> 20:05.198
Interesting time.

20:05.218 --> 20:07.961
But Emily Dickinson came out in such an odd form.

20:08.181 --> 20:09.743
I mean, so selected.

20:09.763 --> 20:10.884
Well, it was posthumous.

20:11.185 --> 20:15.329
And she was being fiddled with by editors.

20:15.369 --> 20:17.211
They attempted to regularise her.

20:17.444 --> 20:20.950
I mean, it took a long time for Emily Dickinson's greatness to be recognized.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.334
I think so, and it's still being evaluated.

20:23.434 --> 20:25.938
I think she's very great, very bold.

20:26.499 --> 20:34.272
And I'm so full of admiration for these mid-nineteenth-century women writers who had to be so bold.

20:34.808 --> 20:36.270
much bolder than we have to be.

20:36.390 --> 20:39.733
I mean, just the fact that they have to assume a masculine pinnake.

20:40.154 --> 20:40.474
Yes.

20:40.794 --> 20:43.257
And, of course, Emily Dickinson doesn't publish at all.

20:43.357 --> 20:43.777
Not at all.

20:43.857 --> 20:45.619
Maybe half a dozen poems.

20:45.679 --> 20:51.305
Which was heard from her, as you said.

20:51.325 --> 20:52.066
Very interesting.

20:53.888 --> 21:01.035
What did you learn in this process, in this procedure, through doing this book yourself, about the creative process?

21:01.657 --> 21:09.985
You talk about being really motivated to get a sense of the creative process, not just a biography of the individual.

21:11.087 --> 21:13.869
Are you talking about, what did I learn, biography?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.232
Well, all of the above.

21:16.252 --> 21:17.573
Take it anywhere you want.

21:17.733 --> 21:18.374
Or about the subject.

21:18.394 --> 21:20.636
How about the subject, I guess, primarily was the question.

21:20.656 --> 21:29.385
Well, I don't think that... I'm going to say anything now that would surprise people who've read her novels.

21:29.585 --> 21:42.602
I think that those people who are immersed in her novels will know that this is a very strong, passionate, vehement person behind that facade of being sort of meek and quiet and modest and dutiful.

21:42.822 --> 21:44.004
I mean, she was meek and quiet.

21:44.124 --> 21:45.826
I mean, she was modest and dutiful.

21:46.226 --> 21:55.999
But when I read the letters, she talks repeatedly of my natural home character, as though this is something completely different from her public character.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.203
And that natural home character, in her own terms,

21:59.437 --> 22:27.385
is somebody who's articulate, laughing, sarcastic and she's got a mind of her own and I suppose I very much enjoyed living with somebody who was so honest who spoke her mind with a kind of Yorkshire vigour and she admired vigour and I admired her professionalism too so in some ways

22:27.550 --> 22:42.011
I'm saying something that wouldn't be awfully surprising to people who know the Bronte as well, but would be surprising to people who have always assumed that the Bronte legend is accurate.

22:43.293 --> 22:46.818
I'm sorry.

22:47.339 --> 22:52.887
We have written a number of books about writers, important writers.

22:53.708 --> 22:54.209
Yes.

22:54.229 --> 22:55.330
I've got a couple of thoughts.

22:55.350 --> 22:57.253
Yes, right.

22:58.347 --> 23:08.666
Going back to the letters that we were talking about earlier, in general, this kind of a book is impossible for writers today, don't you think?

23:09.989 --> 23:14.176
We don't really reveal as much about ourselves through correspondence.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.587
Well, perhaps there isn't so much correspondence because we use telephone.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.929
I understand it, but I mean...

23:21.179 --> 23:32.692
Having said that, I still wonder if a biographer, you know, 50 years, 75 years from now, would be able to... What a goldmine it is to have access to letters.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.235
I'm just wondering, say, Flannery O'Connor.

23:36.276 --> 23:39.059
I thought she was one of the great writers of letters.

23:39.420 --> 23:42.844
Of course, now I'm thinking of Elizabeth Bishop's letters, which just came out last year.

23:42.864 --> 23:44.386
I haven't read those.

23:44.426 --> 23:44.746
Wonderful.

23:44.986 --> 23:47.389
Now, Flannery O'Connor's letters are the dependence.

23:47.842 --> 23:56.695
And you see, you have a situation there that's in a way similar to the Bronte's because she's living distanced from people with whom she has to communicate.

23:56.935 --> 24:04.086
And she's, because of illness in Flannery O'Connor's case, she's shut off there in the South in a sort of intellectual wasteland.

24:04.847 --> 24:09.774
And she's writing letters to the people who are intellectuals and important in her life.

24:10.635 --> 24:14.541
And she reveals a great deal about herself and her art.

24:15.044 --> 24:17.849
and shows herself to be terribly impressive.

24:17.869 --> 24:18.470
Talk a bit.

24:18.750 --> 24:39.043
Here we are in the late 20th century, and we've had many decades of Freudian analysis and all this, and Freudian biography, and here we're dealing with a decidedly Victorian 19th century woman who reveals herself in ways that people today might never would be...

24:39.547 --> 24:42.890
Tell me the responsibility that you feel as a biographer.

24:42.910 --> 24:44.331
I mean, do you... Yes.

24:44.652 --> 24:45.533
All right.

24:45.573 --> 24:46.333
I think... No.

24:46.353 --> 24:56.663
I don't like the term psychobiography, and I don't use any particular formula when I do this, because I'm very suspicious of all categories and all doctrines.

24:56.683 --> 25:02.668
I feel it's very dangerous to bring a grid, you know, of a particular angle and put it down on the subject.

25:03.369 --> 25:06.752
I've actually got a very demanding idea about biography,

25:06.952 --> 25:11.739
In a way, Henry James, an idea, you know, he uses this phrase, the pattern in the carpet.

25:12.180 --> 25:24.017
There's this idea that every writer, if you read, I mean, a significant writer will have a pattern that will speak right through the work.

25:24.498 --> 25:25.239
And T.S.

25:25.259 --> 25:26.942
Eliot spoke of pattern as well.

25:27.062 --> 25:30.507
In fact, I got the idea first from Eliot and then saw it in Henry James.

25:31.248 --> 25:32.710
And Yeats confirms it.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.895
If you look at the great writers, they're telling you this again and again.

25:36.128 --> 25:44.496
Yeats said, a great writer is not the muddle most of us are when we sit after breakfast is being reborn as an idea, something intended, complete.

25:44.516 --> 25:45.937
It's a wonderful statement.

25:45.997 --> 25:52.663
It's suggesting that a great life, an immortal life, is driven by a preconceived idea.

25:52.823 --> 25:56.587
Henry James says art makes life, makes important.

25:56.607 --> 26:00.591
So they don't live as we do in this sort of bungling way from day to day.

26:01.231 --> 26:02.332
They're very directed.

26:02.452 --> 26:05.275
And I think that when you do a biography,

26:05.677 --> 26:14.786
You've got to know what you're doing before you begin, in the sense that you've got to have an idea what is the pattern in the carpet of this particular writer.

26:15.527 --> 26:16.308
Say, in T.S.

26:16.328 --> 26:24.456
Eliot's case, it was the trajectory of the religious life, a very simple pattern, which he got from his grandfather and his mother.

26:24.916 --> 26:35.667
And, you know, it's the simple pattern of the toiling, of pilgrim's progress, of the toiling through ordeal towards some hopes of sublimity, or

26:36.052 --> 26:40.158
trying to construct your life as a vessel for the divine spirit to fill.

26:40.178 --> 26:46.968
And that very simple pattern, when I saw it in Eliot's life, I saw veritive and all the manuscripts confirmed it.

26:47.468 --> 26:52.435
And he constructed his life to fit that pattern as far as it could, although he was a very flawed human being.

26:52.736 --> 26:56.020
But one had to respect the fact that he struggled with his flaws.

26:56.842 --> 27:04.152
In a very New England way, I've written about him as very much somebody who came out of that strenuous New England tradition.

27:04.216 --> 27:07.682
acutely aware of Puritan forebear.

27:07.702 --> 27:12.209
Anyway, well I'm giving you one example because with Eliot the pattern was so clear.

27:12.890 --> 27:27.814
And so that what I'm trying to say is as a biographer you see that pattern and then you've actually got to, in other words you lend yourself to a particular writer and you devise a form for that biography that is dictated by that writer.

27:28.234 --> 27:30.578
So I don't have a formula that I would use for

27:30.895 --> 27:39.049
say all biographies, and I'm certainly swerving away from the sort of plot from pedigree to grave, where you just do a chronology.

27:39.129 --> 27:48.444
And another sort of guideline for myself, as well as Yates, came from Virginia Woolf, an essay I read actually when I was an undergraduate in Cape Town.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.169
She wrote an essay called The Art of Biography.

27:51.209 --> 27:54.614
I didn't know then I'd be a biographer, but I was very impressed with this essay.

27:55.115 --> 27:56.177
And she said that

27:56.697 --> 28:06.668
If biography is going to move towards an art and not just be, you know, a plodding genre, you have to distinguish between the barren fact and the fact that suggests and engenders.

28:07.709 --> 28:26.569
So she's suggesting selection of fact, selection for the live, beating centre of the life, instead of, you know, going to the dentist and, you know, even Leanne Adele, I found it very tedious, that at the end of his multi-volume biography, he does the deathbed in such great detail,

28:26.752 --> 28:36.785
And yet James's mind was wandering, you know, and I think it's demeaning that he says, oh, there his head was lolling up and shaven about its brownie aged blanket.

28:37.265 --> 28:39.368
I mean, that wasn't James the master.

28:39.689 --> 28:41.611
You know, that was James already almost dead.

28:41.651 --> 28:43.153
And how relevant was it?

28:43.253 --> 28:47.138
And it's not relevant to the man who wrote those subtle, you know.

28:47.318 --> 28:54.868
I like the abridged, you read the multivolum one, which was, you know, really...

28:55.034 --> 28:57.418
But I thought that would be... Abridged was better.

28:57.538 --> 28:58.619
There was one guy.

28:58.679 --> 29:01.764
I don't think he's such a good reader of the novel.

29:02.505 --> 29:04.869
And I think he's got too much... It's so important, isn't it?

29:04.909 --> 29:07.052
I think we haven't even touched on that.

29:07.092 --> 29:09.215
I mean, we talk about coming into the subject.

29:09.936 --> 29:18.749
Do you come in with any... I hate to use the word preconception, but do you come with a... And I won't use the word bias, but you certainly come in with an attitude.

29:18.789 --> 29:21.413
Well, I'm coming with an attitude that I'm interested in

29:21.882 --> 29:23.063
The private life.

29:23.403 --> 29:26.066
You've certainly got some opinions.

29:26.086 --> 29:29.690
I've got opinions about biography that are the result of writing it.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.532
About the subject as well, perhaps.

29:32.552 --> 29:33.954
About the subject as well, question mark.

29:34.154 --> 29:37.938
I've got opinions about the biography and, you know, about the subject.

29:38.598 --> 29:46.326
As I said, I'm moving away from... I don't believe in the objectivity of pure record, not in history, not in literature.

29:46.406 --> 29:50.370
I mean, it's there in science, but...

29:50.789 --> 29:51.951
I think that's a delusion.

29:52.171 --> 29:54.215
There's always a subject.

29:54.235 --> 29:56.639
But you certainly look for the life and the work as well, though.

29:56.659 --> 29:59.644
Yes, I'm interested in the interconnections of the life and the work.

30:00.245 --> 30:06.595
And I don't think that it's illegitimate to read back from the work to the life.

30:07.116 --> 30:14.248
In fact, I've been asked to speak in New York and at Columbia about the autonomy of art and the responsibilities of the biographer.

30:14.431 --> 30:23.342
I've been actually given that subject obviously because I don't... I think that you can recognise the autonomy of art, say, with Eliot.

30:24.323 --> 30:44.067
And at the same time, I think it only deepens one's understanding of the work of art if you understand that art is a product of a time, a place, a particular individual, and that the personal concerns that go into the work coexist with what is impersonal and timeless.

30:44.452 --> 30:45.593
in the work.

30:46.114 --> 31:00.312
But I think we're moving much more, I mean, talking from an academic perspective, academe's moving much, much more now into an acceptance of sort of the historical moment, the historicity of a work.

31:00.672 --> 31:04.217
Now, how about when you're engaged in this process?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.780
Does Charlotte, I mean, it sounds almost like

31:07.132 --> 31:10.796
a silly question, but does she really come alive for you?

31:10.816 --> 31:13.079
I mean, do you sit down with her in the morning?

31:13.099 --> 31:17.965
Well, I don't think it would be appropriate to identify.

31:18.005 --> 31:31.380
I mean, I think that people who gravitate into the Bronte society often fantasize they're one Bronte or another, and I wouldn't want to be like that.

31:32.481 --> 31:33.122
I think that

31:33.878 --> 31:35.280
It's as simple as reading.

31:35.861 --> 31:38.205
But this is not a clinical approach, on the other hand.

31:38.225 --> 31:46.058
It's not a clinical... The way I think one should read seriously is that you've got to lend yourself to somebody.

31:46.799 --> 31:51.848
There's some kind of active imaginative sympathy, so you see somebody on his or her own terms.

31:52.409 --> 31:56.375
But I also think then you've got to stand back and judge.

31:58.038 --> 31:58.739
Say with T.S.

31:58.759 --> 31:59.160
Eliot,

31:59.393 --> 32:06.562
He's, as I said, a very flawed person, but also very admirable in his striving off to the religious side.

32:07.103 --> 32:11.749
So that I did try and lend myself to him and see him on his own terms.

32:13.290 --> 32:22.222
But at the same time, as a woman, I had to stand back and see that he treated women very deviously, because he fed them into his papers, ruthlessly.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.327
They were what he... Yes.

32:26.867 --> 32:27.308
So that...

32:27.693 --> 32:30.136
There was a Bostonian woman, Emily Hale.

32:30.697 --> 32:34.281
I brought out that whole story of a long relationship with this woman.

32:34.341 --> 32:36.544
It was perfectly proper, but he kept her under wraps.

32:37.085 --> 32:39.268
And he calls her the Lady of Silences.

32:39.288 --> 32:47.658
In his poetry, he constructs her as a Beatrice figure, as Beatrice was for Dante, which actually she was articulate, a teacher of drama.

32:47.678 --> 32:50.502
I mean, she was different in real life.

32:50.682 --> 32:55.388
And I tried very... I mean, I stood back from Elliot to give her her voice.

32:56.009 --> 32:59.575
so that she had justice done to her as well.

33:00.616 --> 33:12.015
And I saw her as a secret sharer in Eliot's life, and I think that it's very important not to lend oneself so completely to a writer that you can't see them as others do, though.

33:12.656 --> 33:20.448
I was so disappointed to see how quickly people were ready to, like Thackeray, for instance, you know.

33:20.789 --> 33:21.730
Yeah.

33:22.216 --> 33:28.483
She was hot stuff for a while, but then all of a sudden, when the vibrations went another way... Yes.

33:28.503 --> 33:31.587
Well, Zachary was a very traditional, old-fashioned man.

33:31.607 --> 33:37.894
I wanted to get a little more courage, though, maybe a little more, you know... Well, he was rather awful, in that he didn't like it.

33:37.914 --> 33:45.242
He liked women who were sort of softly feminine, who flattered him, and, you know, he put her down a lot.

33:45.782 --> 33:47.945
It is a shame, because she was ready to admire him.

33:48.285 --> 33:49.967
Do you see tragedy in her life?

33:50.468 --> 33:50.788
Yes.

33:51.258 --> 33:51.579
Of course.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.227
I mean, I've tried to keep that tragedy in view at all times.

33:56.508 --> 34:05.304
But I think people who subscribe to the Bronte legend like to feel, oh, she wasn't so different from us because look how weak she was, how she suffered.

34:05.324 --> 34:06.967
She suffered as we would suffer.

34:06.987 --> 34:14.020
But actually, I have to say she wasn't like us because she had the strength to turn lost again in a way most of us don't.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.342
She had the strength to turn lost again, I think.

34:15.929 --> 34:16.309
Yes.

34:16.590 --> 34:22.475
You see, she had terrible tragedies, more than most of us have to endure, with all the deaths.

34:22.495 --> 34:39.672
But one example I gave in the book is when the last of her siblings died, Anne Bronte, in 1849, and she takes Anne at Anne's request for a last look at the sea on the Scarborough coast, and Anne died then, and she and her great friend Ellen, very Anne.

34:39.832 --> 34:40.313
What a scene.

34:40.793 --> 34:41.374
What a scene.

34:41.654 --> 34:44.957
Now, the New York Times book reviewer gave me a very nice

34:45.477 --> 35:13.408
review said why didn't I pull out more stops at that point and she does say very tragic things in her letters about how she's suffering but what I wanted to bring out was also strength not just that she was knocked over because she wasn't totally she did something most of us couldn't do before she got back to Harworth she went in for a great burst of creative writing and what she did was she was at a point in her novel Shirley where the heroine you know you're one of those

35:13.827 --> 35:21.077
19th century scenes of mortal illness and the heroine at the last minute, like Beth in Little Women, pulls through.

35:21.738 --> 35:27.607
And she poured her experience of that deathbed of Anne into that scene immediately while it was hot.

35:27.707 --> 35:28.988
It's fantastic to read.

35:30.190 --> 35:33.895
And because it was a Victorian novel, the heroine had to survive and get married.

35:34.336 --> 35:40.084
But the vehement of her experience is just burning in that scene.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.788
And then she writes to her editor in London,

35:43.207 --> 35:45.290
Now, work saved me when I was thinking.

35:45.490 --> 35:47.553
Its results cheer me now.

35:47.573 --> 35:48.474
Isn't that brave?

35:49.175 --> 35:50.917
Now, you see, that's not like the rest of us.

35:52.720 --> 35:55.984
And she packed so much into 39 years, too.

35:56.124 --> 35:57.306
Amazing, yes.

35:57.426 --> 36:03.274
And also, the way she kept saying she was plain, and people in the Victorian period tell us she was plain,

36:03.490 --> 36:06.113
I don't think she looks plain.

36:06.133 --> 36:10.838
There's one picture you have in here in profile, which I think is... She looks sensible.

36:10.898 --> 36:11.940
I know the one you mean.

36:11.960 --> 36:12.661
Not unattractive?

36:12.681 --> 36:13.682
Not unattractive.

36:13.702 --> 36:23.633
So, that too is... I mean, I don't know why she presents herself as so plain and why she is seen to be so plain, and it has to do with the taste of a particular era.

36:23.913 --> 36:27.878
I thought women had to... She was always very thin.

36:27.898 --> 36:30.561
Maybe if we knew more about the father at this point, it would help.

36:30.743 --> 36:32.565
Maybe it would.

36:32.585 --> 36:35.288
Yes, he didn't take much interest in his daughter's talents.

36:36.049 --> 36:38.452
And his own work's really mediocre.

36:38.512 --> 36:39.733
And it's unbearably boring.

36:39.974 --> 36:43.558
I mean, it would be interesting to know why she felt that.

36:43.638 --> 36:46.822
I mean, I have to think there were some other factors at work out there.

36:47.502 --> 36:55.852
Well, actually, it wasn't her... She was told she was played by her feminist friend, Mary Taylor, who later apologized.

36:56.152 --> 36:56.773
Thanks, Mary.

36:56.793 --> 36:57.073
Right.

36:57.093 --> 36:58.135
Thanks.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.176
Very nice.

36:59.216 --> 36:59.316
Yeah.

37:00.123 --> 37:02.567
I'm sorry, U.S.

37:02.587 --> 37:03.488
Stewart, I interrupted you.

37:03.508 --> 37:04.049
No, no, no, no.

37:04.069 --> 37:07.314
Do go on ahead and look at the things you wanted to offer.

37:07.334 --> 37:11.420
Gina, all right, if you don't mind, this is always a good one.

37:11.620 --> 37:16.668
There was a man from Oxford who actually, it's very rare for people to be dismissed from their jobs.

37:17.088 --> 37:18.550
But he came to Princeton.

37:18.670 --> 37:23.918
He's a medieval Latin, medieval Latin is his subject.

37:24.719 --> 37:27.143
And he's, I mean, a tip-top in his field.

37:27.629 --> 37:30.973
And he went to Princeton and he stole books from Princeton Library.

37:31.513 --> 37:35.798
Now, his psychology, and I'm guessing... Is he American?

37:35.838 --> 37:38.601
No, he's English.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.463
Originally New Zealand, I think.

37:40.764 --> 37:45.849
But his psychology would be, I am the most brilliant person in this field.

37:46.830 --> 37:49.413
Nobody else wants these books in medieval Latin.

37:49.573 --> 37:50.895
I'm the scholar of the world.

37:51.516 --> 37:54.179
And nobody else can appreciate them, therefore I should have them.

37:54.199 --> 37:55.900
Were these printed books or manuscripts?

37:56.161 --> 37:57.282
I'm afraid I don't know.

37:57.683 --> 37:59.546
But he was discovered.

38:00.227 --> 38:06.095
He's lost his job at Oxford, and he's now, I won't say where, but he's found a job in another country.

38:06.115 --> 38:07.897
Well, it's a problem that's endemic, actually.

38:07.937 --> 38:14.166
I mean, the guy I write about is the bizarre example, but the greatest threat is the insider.

38:14.567 --> 38:20.275
The insider who thinks he's... Well, who knows, but also knows how to do it, and can hide, and can destroy the records.

38:20.295 --> 38:24.180
I have a case of a guy down in Georgia who was stealing stuff,

38:24.498 --> 38:49.122
selling it and destroying the records so there was never any they have no idea what you mean they're such good operators and they're insiders and they know that they just discovered 22 missing manuscripts of columbia this summer a couple months ago i think i've got it in my book oh well then you've got lots of stories about this hundreds of stories but british stuff is terrific and i think that there'll be terrific interest in my book well you must tell your publishers that they must

38:49.574 --> 38:53.940
find a way of getting it out into the bookshops in England.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.382
I think it could do very well.

38:55.622 --> 39:01.110
We're looking for a British publisher, you know.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.752
Tell us briefly, is this your ride over here?

39:03.513 --> 39:04.374
No, I don't.

39:04.394 --> 39:06.197
No.

39:07.919 --> 39:17.252
Well, I wanted to go to Bert Norton, the scene of Eliot's, one of his quartets, and although there were photographs in existence of

39:17.570 --> 39:18.351
Burt Norton.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.352
They were flat.

39:19.392 --> 39:21.094
They didn't give one the feeling of the poem.

39:21.114 --> 39:24.498
And I wanted to photograph that scene with the poem in my mind.

39:24.878 --> 39:27.121
So I lay on the grass.

39:27.161 --> 39:28.783
I went at the right time of the year.

39:28.903 --> 39:41.618
I tried to angle the camera just so that I could get that optical illusion, what Elliot perceived as a miracle of water rising out of an empty pool with the sunlight coming through the leaves.

39:41.658 --> 39:47.104
And I had to wait for that little moment, which is so rare in England, where you get that play of light

39:47.287 --> 39:49.931
Lights moving in England all the time because of clouds.

39:49.951 --> 39:50.792
Which time of day did you shoot it?

39:51.032 --> 40:15.505
In the afternoon, and it was September, and the roses had to be in bloom, the second blooming of roses, which comes in the late summer, and it somehow had to do with his time of life, where it was a story of renewal and of renewed love and of also love passing beyond its object because it was a religious poem as well.

40:15.721 --> 40:19.288
And he went to this garden with this woman, Barstony and Emily Hale.

40:20.290 --> 40:26.802
And he had once proposed to her in 1914 before he left for England, and she turned him down.

40:27.583 --> 40:32.633
And then after a very unhappy marriage, she came to England for two years, and they renewed their tithes.

40:32.883 --> 40:34.145
So you got the picture?

40:34.245 --> 40:35.106
And he took it to the back.

40:35.127 --> 40:37.731
So all that was in my mind when I had to take this picture.

40:37.751 --> 40:38.291
I got it.

40:38.452 --> 40:39.293
Did you shoot this one in colour?

40:39.313 --> 40:42.959
In black and white always because I knew the publishers want black and white.

40:42.979 --> 40:44.361
Yeah, but they can, you know.

40:44.381 --> 40:45.122
Can they take colour?

40:45.142 --> 40:45.763
Oh, yeah.

40:45.783 --> 40:48.367
No, but I wanted to get my eye through the black and white.

40:48.527 --> 40:57.922
That play of light was so important because it had to, you had to, the pool that Eliot describes in the poem, you would never guess that it's as big as a swimming pool.

40:58.443 --> 41:01.067
And it's very hard for one to imagine a miracle thing.

41:01.452 --> 41:04.698
because it looks so bland, like an empty swimming pool.

41:05.479 --> 41:11.991
And I had to try very hard to get the play of light on the pool so that it would look full of water.

41:15.076 --> 41:20.085
That's great.
