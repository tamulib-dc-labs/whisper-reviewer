00:01.651 --> 00:03.634
I'm sorry.

00:05.316 --> 00:06.558
You don't mind my taking.

00:07.139 --> 00:10.804
If you're going to say something worthwhile like that, I just can't pick it up.

00:16.132 --> 00:19.176
I'm amazed at the number of books on birds.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.658
I'm supposed to know everything about birds.

00:21.079 --> 00:24.704
I just can't keep up with the goings-on.

00:25.746 --> 00:30.072
For example, Florida alone has had three good books on birds.

00:30.592 --> 00:31.694
Florida birds this year.

00:32.916 --> 00:35.581
And this is only one of the 48 states.

00:35.601 --> 00:43.755
So no matter where you are, there are any addresses that can distribute for the birds within the state.

00:43.775 --> 00:46.320
There might be a book just on one county.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.283
How do you keep it up?

00:49.345 --> 00:49.866
Amazing.

00:49.886 --> 00:54.574
One of the newspapers that takes me is the Registered Guard of Eugene, Oregon.

00:55.027 --> 01:01.153
And the feature editor there, I mentioned, they asked me some of the upcoming features, and I mentioned you.

01:02.414 --> 01:04.416
Oh, he's a hero out here.

01:04.496 --> 01:06.618
I mean, this is bird country in Oregon.

01:06.638 --> 01:07.459
Yes, it is.

01:07.880 --> 01:15.847
And I'm sure that there's just as much regional fascination there as you described in Florida.

01:17.529 --> 01:19.811
But it's amazing, isn't it?

01:19.851 --> 01:23.515
Now, I think in this book here, they mention that

01:24.170 --> 01:28.796
Well, it depends on how you define a bird watcher.

01:29.457 --> 01:32.902
You can say there are two million or sixty million.

01:32.922 --> 01:36.207
Depends on what you call a bird watcher.

01:36.227 --> 01:41.494
Now, a sportsman, a gunner, a duck hunter, can be called a bird watcher.

01:42.215 --> 01:45.840
He might be confined to twenty species.

01:46.478 --> 01:50.102
It might be a garden club lady who walks through the tickety's at her window.

01:50.984 --> 01:59.394
And you have everything between them and the hardcore birds that will go to the end of the earth to see a new bird.

02:00.415 --> 02:01.677
Then you have the scientists.

02:02.257 --> 02:04.640
Bird watching can be many things.

02:04.660 --> 02:07.404
The observation of birds can be many things.

02:08.365 --> 02:14.933
It can be an art, or a science, or a sport, or recreation, an ethic.

02:16.550 --> 02:24.180
I know a priest in Rio Grande Valley who said it can even be a religious experience.

02:24.200 --> 02:24.921
I can see that.

02:25.582 --> 02:27.685
It can be anything, depending on what you are.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.489
I suspect that it's all these things for you.

02:30.869 --> 02:32.011
Most all those things, yes.

02:32.031 --> 02:34.915
I think it can be every one of them.

02:35.115 --> 02:42.485
I've been obsessed by birds ever since I was eleven years old.

02:43.326 --> 02:46.050
That new book of mine,

02:46.942 --> 02:48.263
It shows a flicker on the cover.

02:49.784 --> 03:01.655
The reason flicker is shown is because that's the bird that hooked me way back in April of 1920 when I went to investigate new terrain with a friend of mine up the street.

03:02.495 --> 03:08.240
And we climbed the hill to a place called Swede Hill in Jamestown, New York.

03:08.961 --> 03:12.404
And there on the trunk of a tree was a bundle of brown feathers.

03:13.065 --> 03:16.948
I thought it was dead, and it was lifeless.

03:18.025 --> 03:19.567
All of a sudden, this thing woke up.

03:19.587 --> 03:24.393
It took its beak from the featherless back, and I saw these wild eyes.

03:25.153 --> 03:29.479
It looked at me and then flashed away with these bright golden wings.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.521
And it was a contrast.

03:32.602 --> 03:35.025
What seemed dead was very much alive.

03:35.906 --> 03:40.231
And ever since then, birds have seemed to me the most vivid expression of life.

03:40.812 --> 03:46.699
It was almost like recreation.

03:47.455 --> 03:50.420
No direction.

03:50.440 --> 03:50.760
Really?

03:51.561 --> 03:54.125
You anticipated some of my questions right off the bat.

03:56.149 --> 03:58.993
You mentioned, you know, you give us the range.

04:00.916 --> 04:09.750
We have two younger daughters, 13 and 12, and we have feeders out back, feeders out front,

04:10.051 --> 04:11.613
I don't know if we're bird watchers.

04:11.653 --> 04:15.718
We don't go to Palm Island like maybe we should sometime.

04:16.078 --> 04:17.781
You are bird watchers.

04:18.121 --> 04:20.884
Enthusiasts, perhaps.

04:21.305 --> 04:23.868
There's so many terms been used, like bird lovers.

04:24.869 --> 04:30.997
I don't think that's a good term because birds don't necessarily return our love.

04:31.157 --> 04:31.798
Maybe they do.

04:32.559 --> 04:32.959
I'm sure about that.

04:32.979 --> 04:38.286
We're not sure about that, but love demands reciprocation, or at least the hope of it.

04:38.890 --> 04:45.777
And bird-watching, I think that's a good term, because people do watch birds.

04:46.758 --> 04:56.848
Birder tends to be a term used by the ones that make a sport of it or a game of it, and make lists and so on, and it will travel a good deal.

04:58.310 --> 05:03.635
And we have the hardcore birders who will literally go to the ends of the earth to see new things.

05:04.256 --> 05:08.180
Quite literally, you're going to hear it, right?

05:08.260 --> 05:08.340
Yes.

05:11.847 --> 05:14.831
Bird observer is a rather formal term.

05:16.013 --> 05:21.260
Birder is rather specific, but I think bird watcher is the general term.

05:21.761 --> 05:27.169
It can almost be these epiphanous, exciting moments when you see something.

05:28.330 --> 05:34.900
You know, we live in central Massachusetts, which all of a sudden, we've never seen such a beautiful creature before.

05:34.940 --> 05:41.449
It's almost a metaphor, isn't it, for discovery and for renewal, and you mentioned resurrection and the use of

05:41.800 --> 05:47.929
But as early you said in Mexico, perhaps there are religious experiences suggested.

05:48.670 --> 05:51.314
And I wonder if birds encompass all of these.

05:52.196 --> 05:52.837
I'm sure it does.

05:52.857 --> 05:54.539
Metaphorically, and what is it?

05:54.639 --> 05:58.365
I mean, we can't— See, I'm an artist, basically, by training.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.231
So I think visually, and I'm also a teacher.

06:03.513 --> 06:09.782
And going away through my writings and my paintings and photography, I may—

06:10.825 --> 06:14.210
I'm an opinion maker.

06:15.532 --> 06:22.462
Although I am an activist in a sense, I don't write to every congressman and all that.

06:22.483 --> 06:27.270
I do not understand the political way of doing things, always.

06:28.031 --> 06:32.237
But I am an opinion maker through my writing, and many people will take action.

06:33.399 --> 06:34.801
I think by your example, too.

06:34.861 --> 06:39.448
I mean, you have been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

06:40.357 --> 06:44.762
You can do things stridently, or you can do things quietly.

06:44.782 --> 06:59.156
And there's as much that you can derive from suggestion, perhaps, as there is from polemic, I guess, polemical writing.

06:59.216 --> 07:07.765
To use a cliché, a picture's worth a thousand words, and I can see how

07:08.167 --> 07:11.270
that is true that it predicts a good picture.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.052
Not every picture will do it.

07:13.072 --> 07:26.487
That's not certainly an excellent photograph, or particularly an excellent painting, which encompasses a lot of the artist's past experience, can tell an awful lot about something, can tell many things.

07:27.788 --> 07:29.089
You do a lot of photography.

07:29.390 --> 07:35.156
Some of the pictures are in this wonderful new volume, by the way, which I'm thrilled to be writing about.

07:35.176 --> 07:37.178
Let me just say for a second,

07:37.597 --> 07:40.359
But this book really is a chronology.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.443
It's not a biography or an autobiography.

07:44.523 --> 07:46.045
I'm going to do that someday.

07:46.945 --> 07:48.707
One biographical book has been done.

07:49.448 --> 07:50.108
I didn't write it.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.170
Which one is that, sir?

07:52.190 --> 07:55.273
That's the one that the Devlins did, John Devlin.

07:55.793 --> 07:58.956
The World Exitory Peterson.

07:59.917 --> 08:03.500
Now, there are two authors there, and they're both gone now.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.523
So I can say this.

08:07.043 --> 08:17.619
I think he should have been a novelist, because I had a hard time imagining what she was really referring to at the time.

08:17.659 --> 08:24.389
So, biographies— I appreciate you being gentle here in your critical evaluation.

08:24.409 --> 08:35.245
Yes, and the thing is, biographies can be subject to memory, and memory is a valuable thing, and then one person that might be interviewed might be letter-perfect.

08:35.714 --> 08:36.916
might imagine.

08:37.717 --> 08:55.439
In a sense that a biography, I should say an autobiography by the author himself, can also have weak points, because you'd rather not mention certain people or incidents, and you might stress others.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.984
So neither gives quite the full story.

08:59.144 --> 09:03.730
Let me just say that David McCullough, who was one of my favorite writers

09:04.621 --> 09:14.273
non-fiction, when he decided to do a book about Theodore Roosevelt, he said, I learned so much by having read his own memoirs.

09:14.333 --> 09:23.305
He said, you learn so much by what a person not only says about himself, but as you say, what he chooses not to say about himself.

09:23.325 --> 09:25.307
And there was subtleties there.

09:25.367 --> 09:33.278
And as a biographer, you choose to explore the earth.

09:34.259 --> 09:34.459
I'm sorry.

09:34.726 --> 09:43.178
I think this is an overview of the work of life.

09:43.198 --> 09:44.239
Not everything in the life of humanity.

09:44.259 --> 09:45.501
It could possibly be.

09:45.561 --> 09:46.562
Well, it's a chronology.

09:46.602 --> 10:00.642
By that I mean it shows my growth, and you might say it's a rather simple beginning to a more elaborate thing, both in painting and in photography.

10:01.283 --> 10:04.547
With photography now, which is my therapy.

10:04.932 --> 10:09.358
There's an immediacy about it, and it's fun.

10:11.561 --> 10:22.656
They're coming out with so many new films and new equipment that you can do better and better work, and the standards are becoming higher because of this equipment.

10:22.676 --> 10:30.286
Now, as for my eyes, I've had cataracts removed from both, and I have astigmatism as well.

10:30.787 --> 10:34.872
It takes a third pair of glasses to pull everything together.

10:35.729 --> 10:44.761
I just bless these new cameras that are auto-focused.

10:45.643 --> 10:48.507
Some old-timers would rather do it their old way.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.648
They're imprinted.

10:49.668 --> 10:56.558
But to me, that's much more dependable than my own eyes are.

10:56.838 --> 11:00.343
But they still have to make those lenses behave.

11:00.443 --> 11:04.048
I still have to be able to see a picture, a way of composition.

11:04.417 --> 11:08.001
movement and things of that sort.

11:08.602 --> 11:12.807
You still have to decide what the central focus is going to be, I mean.

11:12.867 --> 11:16.371
It's not a matter of just point and shoot, it's as many people think.

11:18.654 --> 11:23.460
A camera is a brainless instrument, and you've got to make it behave.

11:24.321 --> 11:29.267
It doesn't have a brain of its own, but it's capable of doing remarkable things, rather like a computer.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.230
In that sense, you've got to make it

11:33.188 --> 11:35.992
What kind of equipment are you using?

11:36.052 --> 11:38.736
Right at the present time, cannons and sometimes Nikons.

11:39.838 --> 11:49.092
I've used them all at one time or another, including—what's your camera from Sweden?

11:49.693 --> 11:51.115
Oh, the Hasselblad.

11:51.135 --> 11:59.047
Hasselblad, because Hasselblad himself was a bird photographer, and I remember Ginny and I visiting.

12:00.909 --> 12:02.031
Really?

12:02.399 --> 12:06.185
He took pictures of me at his desk, of both of us.

12:07.407 --> 12:08.068
Wow.

12:08.088 --> 12:12.836
So, I said, do you mind if we shoot you with my mini-Roli?

12:13.197 --> 12:15.681
He said, go ahead, I'm on their board of directors, too.

12:16.582 --> 12:21.109
But he was involved with most cameras around the world, and a remarkable man.

12:21.129 --> 12:24.535
You've got to love that big image, though, that two and a quarter negative.

12:24.755 --> 12:28.862
Yes, and it was partly that larger image.

12:29.298 --> 12:30.620
particularly for black and white.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.043
I still use my Passer Blood ones.

12:33.064 --> 12:33.364
Really?

12:33.484 --> 12:34.005
Most in a while.

12:34.986 --> 12:40.414
But there's so many kinds of cameras, and they do slightly different things.

12:42.517 --> 12:44.801
At the present time I'm devoted to Canon.

12:46.764 --> 12:56.638
I can't haul them all around in the field with me, so I usually have three cameras with me, three camera bodies, two Canons and one Nikon.

12:57.108 --> 13:06.179
When I did an interview back in 1978 with Ansel Adams over at the, he was doing for Yosemite and the Range of Light.

13:06.199 --> 13:10.164
I guess he was a youngster compared to you at that particular point, I don't recall.

13:10.184 --> 13:17.653
But he still did not use an automatic, I mean he basically did it in a very traditional manner.

13:18.474 --> 13:23.740
And of course he was really using the negative, he was making a work of art I guess.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.240
I don't think he saw it as therapy.

13:27.621 --> 13:29.444
But to see his eyes were good.

13:29.864 --> 13:53.355
It's embarrassing for me to go out with a real hotshot young birder who has eyes that are about twenty-five, half as good as a red-tailed hawk, and they can see things in the distance I can't even spot to think, let alone know what it is.

13:54.044 --> 13:58.508
with my glasses and all that, optical equipment as well.

13:59.910 --> 14:04.254
I have about twenty, twenty-five vision, which is pretty good.

14:04.354 --> 14:05.054
Pretty very good.

14:07.016 --> 14:10.680
I still see very well, but my hearing is better than my eyesight.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.583
It's always been really way up.

14:13.663 --> 14:16.545
And is the ear just as important out in the field as the eye?

14:16.565 --> 14:19.768
Yes, I would say the ear is, with some people, even more important.

14:19.789 --> 14:22.431
I've known people who, one of my friends,

14:23.035 --> 14:32.965
in the tropics who wanted to have so many things to deal with in a forest, rather than be detracted by birds moving here and there through the leaves.

14:33.625 --> 14:40.332
He would keep his head down and listen when he heard something that was different, and he would then check on it.

14:43.555 --> 14:52.283
Ted Parker, who knew more about tropical bird voices than anyone, and he would walk along with

14:52.583 --> 14:55.686
eyes on the ground, and then pick up the unusual sound.

14:56.707 --> 15:06.737
Now in the book there's a nice little biographical profile of the beginning, and it describes your going to New York as a lad of eighteen or nineteen.

15:07.638 --> 15:07.738
Yes.

15:07.978 --> 15:11.962
And at that point you perceived your calling as an artist.

15:12.423 --> 15:12.643
Yes.

15:12.783 --> 15:19.890
Without any, I guess with a vague notion of what course the art would follow.

15:20.174 --> 15:23.639
I was thinking in terms of, well, I'll make my living in commercial art.

15:24.720 --> 15:46.069
See, and I was basically an artist at first, and I think that's why I was able to do the field guides, which brought us actually from the shotgun school of ornithology, as it was then, because most scientists would believe a bird only if you had it in the hand, and so on.

15:46.129 --> 15:49.894
And then the specimen.

15:50.195 --> 15:54.722
I did not quite believe that you could be absolutely sure about it just by seeing it.

15:55.483 --> 16:04.937
And I took the other view that a bunch of young kids in the Bronx were very good.

16:05.317 --> 16:11.446
I was not from the Bronx, but I went out with them, so they allowed me as part of their group.

16:11.827 --> 16:19.678
I was the first non-Bronx member, and they taught me the tricks of the trade.

16:20.215 --> 16:23.999
But I, being the artist, was able to pull things together and give it form.

16:24.720 --> 16:31.587
So I've been given so much credit for this, for being part of the environmental movement that started it.

16:31.687 --> 16:35.051
Even Rachel Carson learned her birds through my book.

16:35.792 --> 16:41.218
And I did work on DDT before Rachel Carson did, with the Army Air Corps.

16:42.379 --> 16:47.925
And so we don't do anything all by ourselves.

16:48.245 --> 16:49.767
Man is a cooperative animal.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.583
We tend to work together on most things.

16:54.524 --> 16:57.987
It seems so elemental now, doesn't it, when you think of the arrows?

16:58.107 --> 16:59.388
It makes such perfect sense.

16:59.408 --> 17:04.973
Well, as one of my friends just said, you didn't start that the cavemen.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.596
On their drawings on the walls, they had little arrows.

17:09.176 --> 17:09.477
Yeah.

17:10.498 --> 17:15.162
But it is amazing that it hadn't been—it's almost like the conception of the wheel, isn't it?

17:15.182 --> 17:19.045
It makes so much sense in retrospect, I guess.

17:19.565 --> 17:21.247
So many people judge my drawings.

17:21.367 --> 17:27.875
I think of my field guide drawings, which are schematic and patternistic with arrows.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.597
It's not the way I was trained to draw.

17:29.617 --> 17:35.984
I was trained in the Academy and Art Students League and that, and they're some of the best masters of the day.

17:37.005 --> 17:40.809
Realism, of course, because that was a naturalist that is a realist.

17:42.111 --> 17:49.099
So my other kinds of things, the things I've done as prints for Millpon are more in the

17:49.670 --> 17:58.679
Audubon tradition, although Audubon was not the original inspiration for those, but they might be called Audubon-esque.

17:58.699 --> 18:05.405
And a bit of fuertes in there, which is the following, a feather's following form, paralogary.

18:06.587 --> 18:12.112
And even beyond that, movement in space, backlighting, sidelighting, or whatever.

18:12.152 --> 18:16.116
There are so many ways to paint a bird.

18:16.535 --> 18:22.282
So it's an endlessly fascinating subject for you then, isn't it?

18:22.362 --> 18:22.442
Yes.

18:22.462 --> 18:24.004
I gather there's always something to learn.

18:24.665 --> 18:34.537
So some of my latest paintings have done more environmental, including the third dimensional feeling, three dimensional feeling.

18:35.859 --> 18:45.411
And I want to get back to that, but right now Jenny and I are upgrading the Eastern Field Guide to bring it up to the standard.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.795
of the Western book, which I think is my best so far.

18:50.618 --> 18:54.906
This goes more into detail on some of the immature sore birds, for example.

18:55.807 --> 19:09.812
Some of the scarcer ones, it's usually the immatures that are out of range that we see, and on the different stages which a gull might go through from brown and mature to the pearly-backed adults.

19:10.552 --> 19:12.274
So the camera is essential.

19:12.394 --> 19:14.998
It's more than the therapy.

19:15.478 --> 19:17.841
I mean, philosophically you can't— I can use the camera.

19:17.861 --> 19:21.065
I don't copy it, because the artist has more options.

19:21.085 --> 19:24.790
He can edit out, improvise scenes, composition, and that.

19:25.691 --> 19:33.961
And when it comes to the fall of light, you know, it depends on what time of day you're shooting or what kind of film you're using.

19:34.702 --> 19:39.208
So many things in photography.

19:40.319 --> 19:43.945
An artist can, you might say, pick and choose.

19:43.965 --> 19:49.154
In a way, he uses his past experience.

19:49.174 --> 19:55.265
It's a composite of his past experience, whereas a photograph is a record of a moment.

19:57.289 --> 19:59.372
And very valuable, of course.

19:59.412 --> 20:02.899
Audibon never had photography to use.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.483
I think photographs were just about invented.

20:05.800 --> 20:18.316
When Roger does a field guide, also he likes to go out and get a sense of the bird.

20:18.337 --> 20:31.013
When we did the western field guide, I drove the whole coast of California so that we could look at a lot of shorebirds out there so that he could get a sense of we wanted to see them.

20:31.033 --> 20:35.419
On the other hand, photographs, although they might not be

20:36.040 --> 20:53.203
Although some artists do copy, it's very valuable for the color of soft parts, what colors the legs in life, because a bird in a museum specimen loses the color and passes around the eye.

20:53.223 --> 21:00.393
The eye color, of course, and the colors tend to fade.

21:00.893 --> 21:05.119
The plumage doesn't fade in most birds, although it does in some.

21:05.369 --> 21:14.122
By necessity, as you pointed out, particularly when you're dealing with the field guides, the major artistic influence has to be realism.

21:14.142 --> 21:14.442
Yes.

21:14.462 --> 21:22.414
But you also offer a debt of some gratitude to Impressionism in here, too.

21:22.494 --> 21:23.336
A little bit, yes.

21:23.356 --> 21:25.499
And I wonder if you could just explain a bit of that for you.

21:25.519 --> 21:31.748
Well, Impressionism is a simple fall of light on things.

21:32.335 --> 21:34.657
In realism, there are several ways to paint.

21:34.717 --> 21:42.223
You can paint anything from extremely detailed feather maps, almost every barb you will, on every feather.

21:43.184 --> 21:49.750
But actually, when you see things in the outdoors, it's a general fall of light.

21:49.770 --> 21:51.531
Things tend to be simplified.

21:51.551 --> 22:01.600
You've got shadows and highlights, backlighting and movement in space and all that.

22:02.795 --> 22:04.878
can be very realistic.

22:04.898 --> 22:08.903
It's more the way our eyes really see things.

22:08.963 --> 22:17.053
Now of course the diagrams in the field guides are not exactly impressionism, they're just patterns.

22:17.394 --> 22:22.240
It's a schematic approach with arrows pointing to the marks that are critical.

22:23.301 --> 22:27.807
I think we should definitely point out for the record how your wife does

22:28.478 --> 22:31.202
is an active collaborator with you, isn't she?

22:31.302 --> 22:37.310
And you do work on the habitats, I guess, for— Well, the thing that— The ranges of all of them.

22:37.330 --> 22:41.235
The range maps, and the range maps are a very important part of the book.

22:42.357 --> 22:47.724
And the thing is that birds are extending their ranges, some of them, and some are contracting.

22:48.165 --> 22:53.592
And some birds are doing well, and other birds that are not doing well, for various reefs.

22:54.179 --> 23:00.004
We're looking at all the new breeding bird atlases that's been done.

23:00.024 --> 23:01.606
See, that's a new approach.

23:03.027 --> 23:09.492
They're blocking things out in smaller squares and having people cover them all.

23:10.173 --> 23:11.134
We've got to look at all of them.

23:11.154 --> 23:12.755
And so we've got to try to look at all of them.

23:13.316 --> 23:22.684
I think just about every state except two in the East have good atlases now, and this is within the last ten years.

23:22.782 --> 23:30.812
been unstated so far, which is so apparent, is that these are field guides in the truest sense.

23:30.872 --> 23:34.135
I mean, you don't—these aren't done from your studio online.

23:34.396 --> 23:39.121
I mean, you go out into the field, and this is all in situ.

23:39.422 --> 23:48.913
And the hope of my guide was—of doing the guide was to simplify things, because things have been made so complex by the old-timers, the academics.

23:49.814 --> 23:51.456
As I said before,

23:51.925 --> 23:56.511
It started describing a bird from the tip of the beak to the tip of the tail.

23:57.352 --> 24:08.748
And a robin would be described as having a black tip on a yellow beak, three white spots around a dark eye, six black stripes on a white throat, on a gray head.

24:09.409 --> 24:11.852
Only halfway down the page would you find it had a red breast.

24:12.633 --> 24:20.143
And it seemed to me it could be much more direct than that, because I am a simple, direct person.

24:20.377 --> 24:24.362
training has been as an artist rather than as an academic.

24:24.382 --> 24:27.906
You see, and also, but they're beautiful pictures, too.

24:29.988 --> 24:31.109
They're functional, of course.

24:31.610 --> 24:35.434
I don't think they would be this successfully successful.

24:35.454 --> 24:37.096
It's kind of a different art form.

24:37.416 --> 24:38.418
It is, isn't it?

24:38.438 --> 24:47.248
But they're still so pleasing, and it comes back to, what is it about these birds that engage us?

24:47.288 --> 24:48.409
The interesting thing is that

24:48.912 --> 24:54.678
Practically every school that teaches one thousand, every professional one thousand uses my field guide.

24:55.819 --> 25:10.614
And I remember when our teacher first—she's a great teacher—first had us form a Junior Audubon Club, and we got these little leaf instruments, which outlines the color.

25:11.395 --> 25:14.978
She said, that's not the way to learn to draw, really.

25:14.998 --> 25:17.721
And so she gave us these boxing watercolors.

25:18.359 --> 25:21.463
And he would say, if you wear these color plates, copy.

25:21.624 --> 25:22.545
He gave me the blue jay.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.568
That's why I like the blue jay so much.

25:24.588 --> 25:26.771
It was my first bird that I drew.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.216
But he made no pretense about knowing all the birds.

25:30.376 --> 25:36.766
He said, I'll learn with you, which is quite the opposite of my biology teacher later who tried to dominate us.

25:36.786 --> 25:41.753
He didn't do too well in biology because I would argue with her.

25:42.474 --> 25:46.780
She'd say that the snowy egret is extinct.

25:47.215 --> 25:48.036
No, it's not.

25:48.076 --> 25:49.598
It's been coming back since 1920.

25:49.779 --> 25:52.903
And you don't argue with teachers.

25:52.923 --> 25:56.388
You have the red pants.

25:56.408 --> 26:00.213
And so I did extremely well in certain things as a boy.

26:01.856 --> 26:04.740
Mechanical drawing, tops of the class.

26:04.760 --> 26:09.867
Design, tops of the class.

26:10.889 --> 26:14.033
I did fairly well in writing, but it was only when we

26:14.401 --> 26:17.426
had creative poetry that I immediately went to the topic class.

26:18.087 --> 26:24.436
So my direction has been a little bit that of an artist, I guess.

26:25.958 --> 26:33.169
You mentioned earlier that you plan at some point to write your autobiography, and you said that's in the future.

26:33.991 --> 26:41.522
I sense also from the many tributes that are given in this volume that this

26:41.823 --> 26:49.810
may very differently be a retrospective of six decades of work, but as Shakespeare says, the past is prolonged.

26:49.830 --> 26:55.315
I get a sense here that you feel that your best work may even be ahead of you.

26:55.535 --> 26:56.256
That's right, I do.

26:56.936 --> 27:11.509
And the problem is I'm in my 86th year now, past 86, so how long am I going to be able to have to do this?

27:12.248 --> 27:19.376
I'm about 114 to do all the things that I'd like to do, and I've got to try for it.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.240
My only problem is that I've probably had Lyme.

27:23.260 --> 27:27.184
The problem with Lyme takes a couple of times for my life.

27:27.845 --> 27:36.114
I know once I tried to explain to my doctor who lived in old Lyme about—I said, I've been bitten by three of them lately.

27:36.674 --> 27:38.256
He said, wait until you have the symptoms.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.939
I said, the symptoms aren't all the same.

27:41.324 --> 27:44.508
What I'd like you to do is give me the antidote now.

27:44.528 --> 27:47.632
That was in the way back, when the initial stages— Really?

27:47.652 --> 27:52.679
—before they automatically— And I said, send my blood in to be checked, too.

27:52.699 --> 27:54.601
And he sent my blood in, and I did have it.

27:54.702 --> 27:55.342
No kidding.

27:55.362 --> 28:04.975
But I'd had the doctor and pardon— The flu, what is it, they have a vaccine for it, I guess?

28:04.995 --> 28:07.298
Not yet.

28:08.122 --> 28:09.984
They give it to dogs, but they don't have it.

28:10.004 --> 28:12.527
No, they have something that more than— The ticker causes it, right?

28:12.867 --> 28:13.067
Yeah.

28:13.488 --> 28:17.552
The ticker causes it, right?

28:17.572 --> 28:17.732
Yeah.

28:17.752 --> 28:18.553
The ticker causes it, right?

28:18.573 --> 28:18.673
Yeah.

28:18.693 --> 28:19.394
The ticker causes it, right?

28:19.414 --> 28:19.514
Yeah.

28:19.534 --> 28:20.175
The ticker causes it, right?

28:20.195 --> 28:20.295
Yeah.

28:20.315 --> 28:20.916
The ticker causes it, right?

28:21.256 --> 28:21.396
Yeah.

28:21.416 --> 28:22.177
The ticker causes it, right?

28:22.197 --> 28:22.297
Yeah.

28:22.317 --> 28:22.878
The ticker causes it, right?

28:22.898 --> 28:22.998
Yeah.

28:23.018 --> 28:23.579
The ticker causes it, right?

28:23.599 --> 28:23.699
Yeah.

28:23.719 --> 28:24.700
The ticker causes it, right?

28:24.720 --> 28:24.820
Yeah.

28:24.940 --> 28:25.941
The ticker causes it, right?

28:25.961 --> 28:26.101
Yeah.

28:26.161 --> 28:26.782
The ticker causes it, right?

28:26.802 --> 28:26.902
Yeah.

28:26.922 --> 28:27.703
The ticker causes it, right?

28:27.723 --> 28:27.823
Yeah.

28:27.843 --> 28:28.444
The ticker causes it, right?

28:28.464 --> 28:29.125
Yeah.

28:29.145 --> 28:29.725
The ticker causes it, right?

28:29.805 --> 28:29.945
Yeah.

28:30.066 --> 28:30.666
The ticker causes it, right?

28:30.686 --> 28:30.786
Yeah.

28:30.806 --> 28:31.407
The ticker causes it, right?

28:31.427 --> 28:31.527
Yeah.

28:31.547 --> 28:32.348
The ticker causes it, right?

28:32.368 --> 28:32.548
Yeah.

28:32.568 --> 28:33.129
The ticker causes it, right?

28:33.149 --> 28:33.249
Yeah.

28:33.269 --> 28:33.930
The ticker causes it, right?

28:33.950 --> 28:34.050
Yeah.

28:34.070 --> 28:34.230
The tick

28:35.543 --> 28:50.356
Which was not just as an institute to house my memorabilia, which should be done, of course, but basically would reflect my philosophy and my contribution.

28:50.616 --> 29:03.728
My contribution really has been putting in the hands of teachers and others things that they could work with, whether it be paintings.

29:04.703 --> 29:09.649
paintings, my photography, my writing, and my speaking.

29:13.693 --> 29:27.269
So we have forums on these various things, on creative writing, documentary writing, and the painting, artwork.

29:28.530 --> 29:30.492
We've had forums on photography.

29:30.993 --> 29:32.955
As a result of our forum on photography,

29:33.796 --> 29:41.083
A new association has been started called the National Association of Native Photographers.

29:41.103 --> 29:53.655
Most countries in Europe have such associations, but for some reason here in America we've not had a formal, and that's been really sparked at our forum on photography.

29:54.175 --> 30:01.322
We're going to have the first meeting of that at Fort Myers, Florida next January.

30:02.483 --> 30:09.610
As an outgrowth of this institute, we've got a good many things going.

30:10.391 --> 30:18.539
One of the things that's been widespread has been working with teachers on— The Selburn Project.

30:18.559 --> 30:19.540
The Selburn Project.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.522
How do we spell that?

30:21.922 --> 30:23.504
D-O-U-R-N-E.

30:23.584 --> 30:30.010
That's named after Gilbert White Selburn, where he wrote a lot about what happened.

30:30.310 --> 30:37.419
They take one kilometer of land around their schoolhouse.

30:37.439 --> 30:40.483
This was an idea, this was a concept.

30:40.503 --> 30:47.472
They get this going in the United States, and we've gone out, we've given hundreds of workshops on this to teachers.

30:48.133 --> 30:58.005
And they take one kilometer around the schoolyard, and they investigate

30:58.373 --> 31:05.984
the natural world is there, whether it's bugs, snakes, birds, trees, little sand.

31:07.846 --> 31:16.859
And also, if on that one, in that grid of that kilometer, it is a firehouse, or a water work, or a town hall.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.544
All this is investigated by the children.

31:20.564 --> 31:23.608
And what it does is it makes... Well, they can go too far with that.

31:23.909 --> 31:27.013
I know, but that's all part of the grid.

31:27.938 --> 31:30.241
Into this comes the children.

31:30.281 --> 31:32.283
They write about what they see.

31:32.484 --> 31:33.825
They keep nature journals.

31:34.286 --> 31:36.168
They paint about what they see.

31:37.049 --> 31:39.792
They photograph things that they see.

31:39.812 --> 31:49.244
In other words, it's getting hands-on on the outdoors, rather than with the scalpel and the microscope in so many biology things.

31:49.344 --> 31:55.431
One of the most successful workshops that we've had.

31:56.953 --> 31:57.574
That's exciting.

31:58.280 --> 32:05.307
much of biology in that has done the Germanic method of using the microscope and the scalpel.

32:05.888 --> 32:16.820
And this is getting in the field out of doors, which is hands on, which was in a way which my field guides were doing.

32:16.840 --> 32:26.430
They were relating to the visual things out of doors rather than the such and type of things.

32:27.659 --> 32:38.252
The mission of the Institute is the teaching of teachers so that they can bring it to the children and get children interested in the natural world.

32:38.272 --> 32:52.890
Because a lot of teachers are a bit frightened by it, because of how you deal with natural diversity when there's so many birds and many butterflies and all that, let alone getting down to the dragonflies and things.

32:55.655 --> 33:02.062
trying to break through that wall.

33:03.324 --> 33:13.776
You mentioned, again, to go back to this question about what lies ahead, and you said that some of your best work you feel lies.

33:13.836 --> 33:18.962
Could you just give me an idea of projects that, in your view, you really want to explore?

33:19.022 --> 33:21.865
Well, right now, one thing I've got to

33:22.435 --> 33:23.956
finally bring the field guide up to date.

33:23.976 --> 33:25.118
That's going to take several months.

33:25.178 --> 33:26.699
Then I'll be free to paint again.

33:26.739 --> 33:34.406
I've done a lot of paintings for Mill Pond Press, which were limited edition prints.

33:35.487 --> 33:38.490
But I may even take a different direction than that.

33:38.570 --> 33:42.514
I like the way that Guy Koliak is painting.

33:43.335 --> 33:50.822
You might call him an impressionist, but Guy is, I think, a genius who could paint in any direction he chose.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.054
And how does he spell his name?

33:55.037 --> 33:57.079
C-O-H-E-A.

33:57.700 --> 33:58.942
L-E-A-C.

33:58.962 --> 34:01.605
I'm glad I asked.

34:01.885 --> 34:04.068
It looks like Kohelich.

34:04.889 --> 34:10.756
I think names can be rather useful, I think, of some other bird painters.

34:11.357 --> 34:14.480
Arthur Singer, a good bird painter.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.062
Now, that's a perfect name.

34:16.182 --> 34:17.304
It's Art and Singer.

34:18.085 --> 34:20.067
And then there's

34:20.350 --> 34:26.097
So you've got the painter who does wildlife and all that, that's a good name.

34:26.838 --> 34:32.805
But when you've got a name like Donald Richard Eckelberry, it becomes a little more difficult.

34:32.905 --> 34:36.029
And yet he's a great painter, Koliak.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.492
Most people don't know how to pronounce it.

34:38.512 --> 34:41.516
They think it looks like that.

34:42.717 --> 34:48.484
And don't put that in about that.

34:49.477 --> 34:59.787
There are so many good painters now, more than there have ever been, and some are in a way clones of others, because Bateman has been so successful.

35:00.467 --> 35:01.228
He's Canadian.

35:02.349 --> 35:17.003
So many people try to paint the way he does, and there are times when you can't tell whether it's a Koliak or Bateman, because they've been successful, and so they've got those

35:17.270 --> 35:18.852
The work is derivative.

35:18.872 --> 35:21.716
It's very, very derivative.

35:21.817 --> 35:35.316
On the other hand, there are ones who are trying some far-out approaches, and sometimes happy accident works, other times it doesn't.

35:36.899 --> 35:45.471
See, my own training originally was at the Art Students League with Kaiman Nicolaides, and this book, The Natural Way to Draw, is still

35:45.805 --> 35:48.628
Was he Greek, by the way?

35:48.648 --> 35:52.571
No, he was Kogliak.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.453
Yes, he was Greek.

35:54.473 --> 35:56.715
I'm of Greek heritage.

35:57.476 --> 35:58.957
Kymon is a Greek name, too.

35:58.977 --> 35:59.978
Kymon was.

35:59.998 --> 36:01.039
Is it Kymon or Kymon?

36:01.199 --> 36:04.102
Well, if you're Greek, you'd probably call it Kymon.

36:04.762 --> 36:13.450
We always call him Kymon, and he did The Natural Way to Draw, and that's the great book that was

36:13.919 --> 36:23.872
Because it had to do with more or less keeping your eye on the subject and sort of working down here almost by feel.

36:24.473 --> 36:29.580
But that was hard to explain.

36:30.361 --> 36:31.502
You've explained it very well.

36:32.003 --> 36:36.989
I read or heard somewhere that you're planning a trip to the Antarctic, is that right, Sue?

36:37.009 --> 36:37.250
Yes.

36:37.810 --> 36:40.474
And this is, I guess you have a particular lesson.

36:40.514 --> 36:42.897
Well, I want to...

36:43.383 --> 36:49.912
bring my photography up before I'm too old to be able to stand on those cliffs and photograph these things.

36:50.353 --> 36:58.785
I'm going with a good friend who can fix my camera if it's not going wrong, and who can also help me haul stuff around, a good photographer himself.

36:59.787 --> 37:01.249
They're going to the Falcon, huh?

37:01.269 --> 37:07.818
Going to the Falcon State with a family that I know there that are very interested in wildlife.

37:07.838 --> 37:09.120
When are you doing that?

37:09.657 --> 37:11.920
In December.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.022
Oh, so it's forthcoming.

37:13.262 --> 37:13.803
It's forthcoming.

37:13.823 --> 37:15.205
It's right on the edge of it.

37:15.886 --> 37:16.988
So I'm looking forward to that.

37:17.028 --> 37:27.283
And then what we're going to do, we've got to finish this tail end of the, mostly the, at the present time, mostly the maps of the Eastern Field Guide.

37:28.084 --> 37:28.705
Wow.

37:28.725 --> 37:32.049
And then we've done quite a bit already, but we're doing more.

37:32.610 --> 37:33.451
Some won't need any.

37:35.314 --> 37:39.360
You're such an inspiration, Mr. Priest, and I have to tell you, it's

37:40.133 --> 37:45.378
There are so many people who give up at the age of fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five.

37:46.679 --> 37:55.768
You know, I almost drowned two years ago, before my forty—by my eighty-fourth birth.

37:55.788 --> 37:57.029
Eighty-fourth birth.

37:57.690 --> 37:59.752
Well, how could you tell me a little bit about that?

37:59.912 --> 38:10.022
And I was hit by—I was off the coast of Maine in a boat, returning from photography that I'd been doing with

38:10.745 --> 38:13.227
the people from Blue Earth films and television.

38:13.968 --> 38:18.052
In fact, this was a television show, very successful.

38:18.072 --> 38:20.755
And we were returning.

38:20.775 --> 38:33.467
I had spent the time on Eastern Egg Rock, and then we were returning in the boat towards the Audubon camp, and we were going rather close to Western Egg Rock.

38:33.487 --> 38:40.414
And this rogue wave came, and rogue waves are very little understood.

38:41.052 --> 38:48.020
It could have originated weeks before or days before and long distance away.

38:48.040 --> 38:54.608
It's near the end of an island when that remnant force reaches the end of an island and you get a backlash.

38:55.309 --> 38:56.731
And things go like this.

38:57.372 --> 39:00.095
You have one in a million chance of being under that at the wrong time.

39:00.155 --> 39:00.676
There you were.

39:00.856 --> 39:01.396
There I was.

39:02.157 --> 39:04.680
And not one of us was watching.

39:05.341 --> 39:08.185
At the last moment, someone said, here comes a big one.

39:08.685 --> 39:11.008
And then we flipped over in this great flash of light.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.524
Yes, you go in the water and boat.

39:15.544 --> 39:18.026
Fortunately, none of us were trapped under the boat.

39:18.046 --> 39:24.832
One friend of mine nearly lost his life that way this last year off the East Coast.

39:24.952 --> 39:27.474
Those waters are pretty cold, too.

39:27.955 --> 39:30.437
You see, the thing is, you last about six minutes in that water.

39:30.477 --> 39:40.506
And in this great flash of light, a couple more gulps of seawater, and I would have drifted away, but I held myself.

39:40.773 --> 39:46.162
You see all this dark green water, everything, thousands of dollars worth of television equipment going down.

39:46.523 --> 39:48.627
That's not your major concern.

39:49.067 --> 39:51.512
No, it wasn't your major concern, was to get up to the light.

39:52.253 --> 39:56.500
One nice cleric said, when you were down there, did you see the light?

39:56.540 --> 39:58.924
And I said yes, and I struggled like mad to get up to it.

39:59.626 --> 40:03.993
It wasn't quite the answer, but things to get to the top.

40:04.534 --> 40:06.257
You were 84 when this happened.

40:06.608 --> 40:09.551
Two weeks would be my eighty-fourth birthday.

40:09.571 --> 40:11.413
Were you wearing white vests at this point?

40:11.433 --> 40:11.953
Should have been.

40:12.234 --> 40:13.415
No, we had no white vests.

40:13.455 --> 40:14.736
Because it was a calm day.

40:15.437 --> 40:23.425
And one person pulled my hair, lucky I had some hair, to get my head above water.

40:24.166 --> 40:35.097
And I took a gulp of water, I mean took a gulp of air when I was up there, and held it while the next wave washroom.

40:35.566 --> 40:38.430
take a gulp of air when I got up to the top and hold it.

40:39.030 --> 40:44.438
Finally, I reached the heel of the boat and hung on with the others.

40:44.818 --> 40:54.931
Michael Mayo, who was taken— Well, Michael Mayo, he had all his television equipment.

40:55.632 --> 40:59.377
If it hadn't been for him, I would have drowned.

40:59.417 --> 41:04.864
But he was saved by his wife, because he was being pulled down by fifty pounds of

41:05.401 --> 41:06.722
It was hooked on his battery valve.

41:07.463 --> 41:10.427
It cost him to replace that equipment $150,000.

41:10.827 --> 41:17.655
When he bought it, it was much less, but his insurance coverage— But he's a wife, isn't he?

41:17.755 --> 41:17.835
Yes.

41:17.855 --> 41:19.637
And you know why she was such a good swimmer?

41:20.578 --> 41:30.328
Because her father had drowned, and her mother kept her in a swimming pool in Colorado, although they lived in Colorado, in a swimming pool all the time.

41:31.049 --> 41:33.552
So she was able to swim better than any of us.

41:33.802 --> 41:35.483
Now, how long were you in the water?

41:35.904 --> 41:37.245
Did the boat ride itself?

41:37.946 --> 41:40.228
Well, then, of course, we were all hanging there.

41:41.108 --> 41:49.716
And at that point, once another huge wave came, it was bigger than the rest.

41:49.736 --> 41:51.618
So it was a series of waves, it wasn't just one wave.

41:51.638 --> 41:58.003
You know, the waves tend to be every seventh, seventh, seventy-seventh, seven hundred and seventy-seventh there, all big.

41:59.505 --> 42:00.425
Well, we couldn't hold on.

42:01.126 --> 42:02.307
By that time we were

42:02.877 --> 42:05.321
Closer to the shore, my feet couldn't touch the bottom.

42:05.421 --> 42:06.963
Oh, so thankfully you were.

42:07.304 --> 42:10.128
But then I was being thrown against the rocks.

42:10.148 --> 42:15.636
I was bloody—my shoulders were—I thought my shoulders were shook.

42:15.656 --> 42:19.502
And I could not drag myself out of the water, because I was so too weak.

42:20.123 --> 42:21.805
And Michael Mayo pulled me out.

42:22.867 --> 42:25.451
But he couldn't have done that if his wife hadn't saved him.

42:26.392 --> 42:31.500
So he dragged me up on the rocks, laid me there, and meanwhile his wife and

42:31.970 --> 42:39.181
a tent had come up, and this was put over me.

42:40.082 --> 42:49.737
And one fellow had a cigarette hose that was still working, so they made fires to alert the fastening boats.

42:50.358 --> 42:53.844
Well, finally a boat full of puffin watches came by.

42:53.864 --> 42:56.728
If I hadn't written a field guide, they wouldn't have been there.

42:57.265 --> 43:11.839
See, I was in hypothermia, but by the time the Coast Guard came there, I was kind of delirious.

43:12.639 --> 43:18.685
And I remember seeing, against this weak light on the top, this butterfly sitting on top.

43:18.705 --> 43:19.746
I thought, well, that's a monarch.

43:20.767 --> 43:24.150
I said, no, that's too big for a monarch.

43:24.704 --> 43:27.627
Then it's just not the shape of a monarch.

43:28.048 --> 43:31.111
It's more like a red admiral or an angle wing.

43:31.691 --> 43:33.794
I thought, oh my God, it may be an angel's wing.

43:33.814 --> 43:36.417
You know, I was kind of hilarious.

43:37.017 --> 43:42.143
And I was too weak to check on it and I just collapsed again and fell asleep.

43:42.203 --> 43:43.844
Where was this precisely?

43:43.864 --> 43:45.006
Off the coast of Maine.

43:45.807 --> 43:46.587
West Egg Rock.

43:47.068 --> 43:47.408
West?

43:48.029 --> 43:48.750
West Egg Rock.

43:48.970 --> 43:50.732
Egg is an egg rock.

43:50.752 --> 43:51.332
Three words?

43:51.352 --> 43:53.715
Yes.

43:53.915 --> 44:07.875
But the thing is that by the time the big Coast Guard boat came, which is offshore, then four men came up in a zodiac or something.

44:10.118 --> 44:16.868
They tried to walk me down, but I was too weak, my legs were too weak to get over that slippery rock wave.

44:17.509 --> 44:21.795
So they laid me on a stretcher and bound me across the shoulders.

44:22.501 --> 44:31.873
It was the most helpless feeling I've ever had, just looking up at this gray mess, it was getting sort of dark, and I saw Alicia's storm petrel fly over.

44:32.474 --> 44:35.197
It was an appropriate bird to see, but I don't know whether I really saw it.

44:36.178 --> 44:42.787
And by midnight I was in the hospital at Boothbay to check my vital signs.

44:42.807 --> 44:51.057
I was there two days, and my heart was okay, even though I'd been struggling so much that my heart hurt.

44:51.728 --> 44:54.291
And my hip was not broken as I thought it was.

44:55.232 --> 44:58.015
I was in better shape when I went out of the hospital than when I got in.

44:58.095 --> 45:13.173
But the hospital had the rule that not to talk to reporters about any person in trouble, because maybe the person who was in trouble didn't want to know what was wrong.

45:13.193 --> 45:21.583
In fact, I would have been happy to have people know that the nurse never

45:22.120 --> 45:27.208
So the New York Times tried to piece it together about their own, and they came close to being correct.

45:27.228 --> 45:29.792
They were being correct.

45:29.812 --> 45:30.994
They were the closest to anybody.

45:33.758 --> 45:40.949
But in one news report it was an eighteen-foot boat, and another report it was a forty-two-foot boat, and another was a thirty-fourth.

45:41.630 --> 45:44.835
See, they were all getting— Sure.

45:44.855 --> 45:45.236
Well, what was it?

45:45.256 --> 45:46.037
How many feet?

45:46.057 --> 45:49.242
It was about thirty-two.

45:51.938 --> 45:55.502
Well, what wisdom do you glean from this experience?

45:55.843 --> 45:58.486
Never to go out without a life jacket on.

45:58.606 --> 46:03.832
Well, that's fundamental, but I wonder if there's anything, any wisdom.

46:04.293 --> 46:06.596
Every day is important in your life.

46:07.076 --> 46:21.574
And if I had just gotten one really bad review by Kenny Parks again, I don't remember his name, I would have taken another couple of gulps.

46:22.162 --> 46:27.731
No, mainly it's because I had two books to finish.

46:27.751 --> 46:29.894
He had books to do.

46:29.914 --> 46:31.277
He had to go on.

46:31.357 --> 46:32.879
I couldn't give it.

46:33.080 --> 46:36.505
Is there a secret to this, Mr. Peterson?

46:36.545 --> 46:39.810
Can you explain what it is?

46:39.850 --> 46:42.635
No, why I should be so lucky.

46:43.176 --> 46:44.558
Any one of those five people.

46:44.639 --> 46:46.181
I'm not just talking about that incident.

46:46.221 --> 46:51.606
I'm just talking about the inspirational example you give to all of us.

46:51.626 --> 46:52.988
I mean, eighty-six years old.

46:53.949 --> 46:54.850
Well, I have more to do.

46:54.870 --> 47:00.456
I think it's as simple as that.

47:00.476 --> 47:04.040
Well, that's a good one to end on, isn't it?

47:04.060 --> 47:14.511
I don't want to overstate my... Well, the main thing, I'm going to be careful in the Antarctic, because I've had one or two close calls down there in

47:14.913 --> 47:20.538
Because of waves and boat trouble.

47:20.558 --> 47:22.040
No, you're not going on this trip.

47:22.060 --> 47:29.827
No, I've been five times, and last Christmas I was there for about almost a month.

47:29.847 --> 47:35.713
And my children asked if I could please have Christmas with them this year.

47:36.494 --> 47:38.516
So I asked Roger, sorry if I stayed home this year.

47:38.536 --> 47:39.497
I'm not sure.

47:39.517 --> 47:41.899
I've got this wonderful man going once on the floor.

47:42.065 --> 47:44.208
We'll take good care of them.

47:44.228 --> 47:45.650
Russ Kenny.

47:45.670 --> 47:48.654
She's worked out very well.

47:48.854 --> 47:51.157
I love the Antarctic, too.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.220
It never gets boring, does it, to you?

47:53.240 --> 47:53.781
It never does.

47:56.965 --> 48:03.174
I could say I don't really have to do this, but I want to improve on things I've done in the past.

48:03.815 --> 48:07.780
In the Falklands, you've always wanted to spend more time in the Falklands.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.063
I presume I'll not have another Antarctic trip.

48:10.564 --> 48:11.565
I just want to do it right.

48:11.782 --> 48:24.233
See, I've gotten some awfully good pictures in the Antarctic, but there are certain things that have to do with depth perception and that that I can improve on.

48:24.994 --> 48:26.815
Lerch is known as the king penguin, too.

48:26.835 --> 48:28.817
That might be interesting for your audience.

48:28.837 --> 48:32.420
Well, my friends in Texas call me the king penguins.

48:33.381 --> 48:37.525
I don't really have a—I'm not quite sure what my favorite bird is.

48:37.545 --> 48:41.248
I could say it's the Flicker, because that's the bird that hooked me.

48:41.633 --> 48:45.138
I could say it's the Blue Jay because it was the first bird I drew.

48:45.158 --> 48:48.022
I could say it's the Oscar.

48:49.143 --> 48:52.328
I repeat myself.

48:52.708 --> 48:54.771
That's okay.

48:55.592 --> 49:01.280
When people ask me, what is my favorite bird, I find it difficult to answer because I like all birds.

49:01.821 --> 49:09.632
But in my boyhood, it was the Piliated woodpecker, the big flamboyant woodpecker.

49:09.848 --> 49:17.418
I could say that the blue jay is my favorite bird because that was the first bird I learned to draw, the first bird I tried to draw, rather.

49:17.458 --> 49:31.918
And I could say the flicker is my favorite bird, and it probably really should be because it was the bird that hooked me on watching birds.

49:31.938 --> 49:37.746
I've told this story several times about this bundle of brown feathers on the tree trunk and I just

49:38.249 --> 49:42.194
I thought it was dead and it was very much alive when I poked it.

49:43.076 --> 49:51.507
And this contrast between death and life, or what I thought was dead and what was alive, was like resurrection.

49:51.547 --> 50:07.429
And I could say in a way that the Osprey is a favorite bird, which is the one that I've been most concerned with, helping it make its comeback here in the East.

50:08.793 --> 50:19.627
And as a family of birds, the penguins are my favorite family, and I enjoy the king penguin most because it's so colorful and flamboyant.

50:20.628 --> 50:24.212
And my friends in Texas call me the king penguin.

50:25.234 --> 50:30.200
This group in Texas always gives bird names to various people.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.501
They choose the name.

50:31.682 --> 50:34.305
You don't have anything to do with that.

50:34.325 --> 50:38.310
Ginny's called the Woodthrust because she sings well.

50:38.678 --> 50:39.800
has to keep out of the sun.

50:42.444 --> 50:43.706
So she's called the Woodthrust.

50:44.066 --> 50:45.007
That's great.

50:46.049 --> 50:48.212
At any rate, I'm the King Penguin.

50:48.232 --> 50:52.298
I don't know why I'm not the Emperor Penguin.

50:52.399 --> 50:59.249
I know you've got another interview coming up, so I think I'm going to give you a few minutes to get ready for your next interview.

50:59.329 --> 51:01.412
You've been very generous with your time.
