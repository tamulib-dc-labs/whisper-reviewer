WEBVTT

00:00.976 --> 00:01.937
We're talking.

00:02.177 --> 00:03.319
Okay.

00:03.339 --> 00:06.302
To Linda.

00:06.322 --> 00:06.822
Nice buck.

00:07.943 --> 00:14.130
Congratulations on your buck.

00:14.170 --> 00:15.331
Thank you.

00:15.371 --> 00:22.019
Did you undertake this as a form of exorcism for you?

00:22.179 --> 00:24.261
No, no, exorcism.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.905
I undertook it as a process of integration, I'd have to say.

00:28.045 --> 00:29.987
In fact, I am sitting in that cubicle there.

00:30.271 --> 00:31.512
writing, I was on my way.

00:31.532 --> 00:38.800
I was walking down on Wealth Avenue and thinking about these very disparate experiences I had in my life, which were ten years apart.

00:39.241 --> 00:46.408
And that was my debut in something called The Pops, and my entering a center for trauma and dissociation to try to get help for the trauma in my life.

00:46.428 --> 00:57.460
And I thought, really, the biggest work in my personal life and in a literary sense, for both a creative sense, for both my music and my writing, is how to weave these narratives together somehow.

00:57.710 --> 01:09.504
And I had thought of beginning in 1982 and writing through 1992, but I realized that that part of the discipline of the memoir is what you keep out, what you decide to put in and what you decide to leave out.

01:10.085 --> 01:20.477
And I decided that these two narrative streams of 1982 and 1992, which were such epic years in my life, would work both as a contrast and as a kind of ultimate weaving together.

01:21.338 --> 01:26.164
The other thing I did was, as a musician, because I wasn't writing in straight chronological form,

01:26.397 --> 01:27.678
And I couldn't find a literary form.

01:27.698 --> 01:29.661
I tried to find a musical form for what I was doing.

01:30.341 --> 01:33.485
And the notes that you see on the cover there are from Beethoven's Sonata, Op.

01:33.505 --> 01:34.206
109.

01:34.606 --> 01:39.992
And the opening movement of that sonata is really a kind of loose basis for the form of the book.

01:40.212 --> 01:43.896
And there are two sections in that opening movement.

01:43.916 --> 01:47.560
One is very fast, and one is very slow and kind of tragic.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.302
And the fast one kind of goes briskly by.

01:49.602 --> 01:53.767
So you have seven measures of time, which go by like that, in maybe 10 seconds.

01:53.787 --> 01:55.729
And then you have this adagio, which interrupts

01:56.013 --> 02:00.819
And it's tragic and takes seven measures, then take three times as long to get to it.

02:01.080 --> 02:09.671
So you have a real plane of time going on, and a plane of pothos versus, you know, kind of, um, buoyant, much more buoyant passage of music.

02:09.691 --> 02:14.638
And I thought that really, the 82 passage was best represented by the vivace.

02:14.978 --> 02:16.180
The time went by more quickly.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.626
You'll see the, you know, just about the vivace.

02:21.887 --> 02:23.129
V-I-V-A-C-E.

02:23.489 --> 02:24.431
It's in the book also, too.

02:24.571 --> 02:25.412
But it,

02:25.882 --> 02:43.769
What happens is time moves more quickly, and in the book, the 1982 section, it goes from April 1982 until July 1983 when my brother dies, or my second brother, and then the 1992 section is much more contemplative and slowed down, and you're only having one month of time, which is the month that I was with the parents, and then they're getting help.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.993
So the playing with time is very similar to the way they time plays with time in the music.

02:47.013 --> 02:49.016
And did you see those moments when you're walking down the street?

02:49.297 --> 02:49.637
Ah, yes.

02:49.798 --> 02:54.184
I was walking down the street and thinking, how in the world I attempted to write a novel, and

02:54.856 --> 02:58.881
Thank God that I had the practice of writing a whole book before doing this one.

02:59.442 --> 03:01.285
Trying to fictionalize my story didn't really work.

03:01.465 --> 03:04.729
I got further away from the emotional traits instead of closer to those.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.233
Why did you want to fictionalize them?

03:07.253 --> 03:10.797
A little fear about exposing yourself to the world.

03:11.218 --> 03:15.023
Wanting to expose the emotional traits, but not wanting to expose the world characters.

03:15.924 --> 03:22.433
And also just the imaginative fancy of trying to make myself into something else.

03:22.717 --> 03:28.565
I was a painter instead of a musician, and I had one sibling guy instead of two, so it was a little less tragic.

03:28.625 --> 03:34.674
However, any of your novelists who have captured, you're still exposing yourself to the war.

03:34.954 --> 03:35.435
Absolutely.

03:35.655 --> 03:40.262
You're probably even clearly more naked than just letting it all hang out.

03:40.282 --> 03:41.143
Yeah, absolutely.

03:41.223 --> 03:51.357
In fact, it was very naked, but it was also a beginning book, and it lacked the cultures in this, I think, the inner sleep cells, it lacked that one.

03:52.535 --> 03:53.997
a structure to come together.

03:54.037 --> 03:58.461
Were you able to imagine it through any professional experience?

03:58.702 --> 04:14.819
I was able to, but imaginatively went too far from my own story, and I ended up getting into a kind of, almost, an argument with myself about the imagined characters versus what really happened.

04:14.839 --> 04:18.002
And I realized that in order to write a good novel for me,

04:18.320 --> 04:23.569
I was going to have to write a memoir first that really did tell the truth of my story.

04:23.589 --> 04:32.583
Well, this walk I was trying to tell you about was from my therapist's office over Marlboro Street to the writer's room.

04:33.305 --> 04:39.715
And I had crossed a little piece of sidewalk where the silence you've worked out was written.

04:39.735 --> 04:44.563
You know, that's the kind of warning about AIDS.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.729
And I thought about how my father had tried to buy my silence with the piano.

04:48.749 --> 04:59.519
And I thought, how can I integrate my music and my writing and my life on stage with, you know, the very sad life of trying to, you know, get help and work things well in.

05:00.320 --> 05:13.032
And this narrative, as I was walking, started to emerge of rehearsal, rehearsal, practice, audition, audition, John Williams, backstage and tape, it's over in Denver, rehearsal.

05:13.231 --> 05:21.841
this wonderful, you know, non-class fancy for the ball rehearsal on a dusty old upright piano, you know, in the cafeteria at the center.

05:21.861 --> 05:28.068
And he's kind of from parallel there, and it's starting to go, and as you can see, it's one of the real chapters in the book.

05:28.649 --> 05:29.630
And that's the first thing I wrote.

05:30.091 --> 05:36.058
And then I, I don't know if this should be, maybe this should be off the record at that time.

05:36.598 --> 05:39.722
I wrote Kate Medina through Elizabeth Berg, and she actually seen it.

05:40.002 --> 05:42.225
That's 14 pages of parallel marriage.

05:42.728 --> 05:43.869
And said, this is wonderful.

05:44.049 --> 05:44.850
Can it be a book?

05:45.510 --> 05:48.633
And I thought, well, I don't know.

05:48.753 --> 05:50.415
And that case is lovely.

05:50.435 --> 05:51.776
She's a wonderful woman.

05:51.796 --> 05:53.217
And all of a sudden, I'll go on.

05:54.298 --> 05:55.739
This won't be my piece, by the way.

05:55.759 --> 05:56.360
No, thank you.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.262
My publisher was good.

05:58.302 --> 06:00.263
But I know you have six versions of Random House.

06:00.323 --> 06:01.845
I guess it would stop.

06:01.905 --> 06:03.026
They canceled me.

06:04.087 --> 06:05.768
That does not have to be my kid.

06:05.788 --> 06:06.889
Just for yourself.

06:07.369 --> 06:09.411
I just told her.

06:09.591 --> 06:09.972
Okay.

06:10.352 --> 06:12.634
So she was going to have a draft.

06:12.817 --> 06:14.579
I think that's the Friend.

06:15.480 --> 06:16.361
Yeah.

06:17.222 --> 06:20.065
And... I don't care.

06:20.885 --> 06:24.469
If this is going to publish his weekly piece, that would have been a day after 30.

06:24.549 --> 06:24.890
No.

06:24.910 --> 06:25.831
We really have to.

06:25.851 --> 06:26.111
Exactly.

06:26.131 --> 06:28.073
This is the kind of thing they want.

06:28.754 --> 06:29.795
Oh, I see what you think.

06:29.835 --> 06:33.839
No, no, I mean, just in the other way, I'm probably really pressing for this.

06:33.919 --> 06:34.300
Yeah.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.141
Because this is... And I publish it.

06:36.262 --> 06:36.842
Yeah.

06:37.323 --> 06:37.943
Well, anyway.

06:37.963 --> 06:40.366
So I came with me asking Kevin Spearback at LA.

06:40.886 --> 06:42.368
I accepted the challenge, and...

06:42.955 --> 06:52.313
I just took a sabbatical from the writer's room, and went home, and I had to bring in the piano for this, because I knew that Halston area was going to be straight out of the music.

06:52.333 --> 06:58.926
And so I could bring in the piano, playing at the theater, and then turning the score and running up to the computer, plopping it down, and everything.

06:59.226 --> 07:03.254
So this thing really formulated itself at the theater?

07:03.274 --> 07:03.715
Absolutely.

07:03.914 --> 07:04.956
That's a piano operator.

07:06.298 --> 07:07.560
Did you actually see the keyboard?

07:07.580 --> 07:08.421
It has a keyboard.

07:08.441 --> 07:09.863
It is a keyboard.

07:09.883 --> 07:12.347
A secondary keyboard.

07:12.547 --> 07:16.333
I mean, the piano is my primary keyboard in a lot of the narratives.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.380
Well, you see, I used to spend hours practicing with a notebook.

07:20.460 --> 07:25.868
So that if I were to stop it, I would write down the distractions and then go to work.

07:25.888 --> 07:30.856
Now, you see, if I were to work to pass it, yes, they would.

07:30.896 --> 07:31.677
His father spoke.

07:31.977 --> 07:55.808
I would have guessed it would have developed a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new, a new,

07:55.990 --> 07:58.793
You love this piece, and somebody contacts her, and so I said, what?

07:58.813 --> 07:59.494
No, no, no.

07:59.514 --> 08:00.475
That's not what happened at all.

08:00.715 --> 08:03.138
It came into your big contact series as a result of the first column.

08:03.158 --> 08:04.139
Really?

08:04.560 --> 08:05.861
And she said, you have a book in there.

08:06.142 --> 08:09.926
And I don't know, which... Well, so we can't do anything to follow up with her.

08:09.946 --> 08:10.727
Yeah, it's true.

08:10.867 --> 08:11.808
So we can't do something.

08:11.828 --> 08:12.569
Well, no, I know.

08:12.629 --> 08:13.350
That's actually good.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.271
Yeah, it did.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.173
Yeah, but it's of her interest.

08:16.233 --> 08:17.375
You're absolutely right about that.

08:17.435 --> 08:19.057
But... No, I didn't know about that.

08:19.237 --> 08:19.838
Absolutely.

08:19.858 --> 08:20.839
That's how it happened.

08:20.859 --> 08:24.563
But what I mean, though, in terms of looking at the writer and the creative process,

08:24.914 --> 08:30.301
is that the Hearst College Fund was by nature a very compelling piece.

08:31.643 --> 08:37.671
There was nothing about the family violence.

08:37.952 --> 08:42.838
It's straining to tell, but it's straining to somehow get the secret out of it.

08:43.098 --> 08:46.463
You know, Judith and the beginning of trauma and recovery wrote something.

08:46.543 --> 08:48.245
It's so true.

08:48.366 --> 08:50.989
Every trauma survivor has to deal with

08:51.526 --> 08:54.129
dialectic of tell.

08:54.690 --> 08:58.634
You feel those things in equal measure.

08:58.654 --> 09:00.897
You feel such a need to tell.

09:01.518 --> 09:04.241
And yet, in your experience, it's pushing me to tell.

09:04.461 --> 09:12.731
And your experience with the threats that your father gave you, or the threats of the world, threats against telling.

09:12.751 --> 09:14.333
And you feel a tension of a measure.

09:14.373 --> 09:19.018
And that same tension was what I struggled with to get the Harris call on that, and that same tension

09:19.285 --> 09:21.187
also is what a struggle with Peter Blossom.

09:21.207 --> 09:23.049
How about the Grace column?

09:23.189 --> 09:46.872
I was in the writer's group that I wrote, and the rest of the group that I acknowledged in the book, and they were in Boston as they were in Boston, and I had come back from the Denver Center, joined the professor of the artist group, and within a week of my retirement, I stayed with a box for my parents, which contained with lingerie, as it was.

09:46.892 --> 09:48.313
And I really wrote the piece.

09:48.682 --> 09:50.544
to get that out of me.

09:50.564 --> 09:53.647
I mean to just practice what I was going to do with that.

09:54.127 --> 09:58.431
And really the ending of the piece is that all five of us went and said back to my parents.

09:59.572 --> 10:01.294
Came while I was writing the piece.

10:01.694 --> 10:03.976
I was writing the piece to kind of figure out how to deal with it.

10:04.156 --> 10:09.361
So it was really that one was really trying to write my way out of a very painful situation.

10:10.182 --> 10:16.528
When I finished the piece and then went to my writer's script, Sally Brady, who is also major, under one degree,

10:16.812 --> 10:18.935
That hair looks like this is a very calm.

10:18.955 --> 10:20.457
You know, let me send it somewhere across.

10:20.577 --> 10:21.338
Well, I'm not ready.

10:22.199 --> 10:24.822
Let me sit like that so I sat on with it for about three months.

10:24.842 --> 10:30.790
Trying to decide when I write it to write something private, you know, or less.

10:32.231 --> 10:35.295
You know, sometimes you write peaches for yourself.

10:35.335 --> 10:44.847
Sometimes you write peaches, which, you know, this was an exceedingly private peaches.

10:44.907 --> 10:45.368
Right.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.070
What I'm saying is I wrote a piece to myself.

10:48.090 --> 10:50.614
I wrote a lot of other essays that have been published.

10:50.634 --> 10:54.919
I guess when I had written so much stuff in a few people, I had just a different month.

10:55.360 --> 10:55.941
Am I right?

10:55.961 --> 10:57.683
Oh, you wrote to the writer's book?

10:57.763 --> 10:57.963
Yeah.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.807
And I'm very kind of private.

11:01.047 --> 11:03.210
I'm not trying enough.

11:03.270 --> 11:06.334
So it's a safe place to try.

11:06.354 --> 11:10.099
And then I thought, no, this is a student.

11:10.179 --> 11:13.143
I said, oh, I'm going to take the rest.

11:13.283 --> 11:14.545
And I said, here it is.

11:15.166 --> 11:31.108
and left out the second page and said, oh my god, another business, fantastic writing, but I'm not paying, please send that second page.

11:31.128 --> 11:33.351
So, I think it was 1,500 words.

11:33.371 --> 11:37.356
The first column, she doesn't know.

11:37.516 --> 11:42.523
Oh, gosh.

11:42.655 --> 11:43.797
Well, we're important enough.

11:43.857 --> 11:44.979
Yes, I can.

11:44.999 --> 11:46.442
No, thank you.

11:46.502 --> 11:49.908
Well, you know, I think about school when I was there.

11:49.928 --> 11:50.228
Yes, I am.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.072
You know, I can't do it.

11:52.132 --> 11:52.733
I can't do it.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.154
I can't do it.

11:53.174 --> 11:54.456
I can't do it.

11:54.476 --> 11:54.977
Yeah.

11:54.997 --> 11:57.281
Well, if it wasn't that you had, it was my fault.

11:57.321 --> 11:57.542
Yeah.

11:57.562 --> 11:58.323
I can't do it.

11:58.443 --> 11:59.806
I can't do it.

11:59.826 --> 12:00.647
I can't do it.

12:01.302 --> 12:12.932
Well then, at the time, we had a first phone at about, you know, they were doing, you know, one, two pages, and I think she describes, you know, only one day.

12:12.952 --> 12:14.073
So this is 93.

12:14.094 --> 12:14.794
93.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.798
And so then, making another request.

12:18.978 --> 12:26.785
I met her in April 94, and I had written the slides that began memory slips, and that's what she had committed for.

12:27.526 --> 12:29.487
So she was, of course, the first publisher.

12:30.068 --> 12:31.309
Oh, but when did you come to?

12:31.610 --> 12:37.516
And I had a proposal, and I was like, did you write about it?

12:38.176 --> 12:44.162
No, we sent her, I think the first night, and she loved it.

12:44.602 --> 12:47.325
It was me.

12:47.345 --> 12:54.111
It was a couple of luckers, but at the time we're taking, well, I don't know, it's a book check.

12:54.131 --> 13:00.537
But Captain Hampton, it's not that we had a lot, it was too close, and a lot of the ministers died, I don't know.

13:00.972 --> 13:02.835
Um, so we turned it on.

13:02.855 --> 13:06.440
I planned it ultimately, and let's use it as a formula in the script.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.002
But yeah, I'll tell you what.

13:08.082 --> 13:09.104
I didn't want to say it.

13:09.224 --> 13:13.390
Happened through every month, but really, I needed to just take this away.

13:13.410 --> 13:15.133
I finally got it sad, because I won't be in the script.

13:15.153 --> 13:16.935
That's all why I was in the closet.

13:16.955 --> 13:22.403
And I was just telling where there was 18,000 modifications.

13:22.423 --> 13:22.984
Oh, wow.

13:23.004 --> 13:24.085
$60,000 went up.

13:24.226 --> 13:24.586
Wow.

13:24.746 --> 13:28.051
And I was like, oh, no, really?

13:28.071 --> 13:28.252
Yeah.

13:28.272 --> 13:30.415
At first, I don't like that.

13:30.435 --> 13:30.675
You do?

13:31.381 --> 13:59.262
That turtle at her phone

13:59.866 --> 14:03.211
The class musician's greatest player, which is all known as well.

14:03.311 --> 14:05.774
So what came to what writers are still about writers?

14:06.335 --> 14:16.249
You get up on the house, you're in the middle of the piece, maybe you're playing a board for sure, and oh my god, what happens to every course of this one who can get an hour for a minute, that I would have to work in a lot of cases in the law class and all that.

14:16.269 --> 14:19.514
Well, they learn the art as part of your training.

14:19.534 --> 14:23.720
It's part of... You learn how to get well about membership.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.943
And that's what you need for me.

14:26.003 --> 14:28.607
On stage, in the very beginning, they talk about how I'm going.

14:29.296 --> 14:32.860
I only had a memory of my name, but I had a foot still.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.303
And I still had a piece of memories in the house.

14:35.323 --> 14:37.185
And when I was a sister, I had a past year who was young.

14:37.205 --> 14:42.271
And I was in the beginning, I mean, they helped me out a period of flooding and trees of memories.

14:42.291 --> 14:47.958
And I couldn't go back through the rest of the conference, seven minutes left, but I thought, I'm not going to afford a medical conference in Florida.

14:47.978 --> 14:49.019
So I'm not going to watch.

14:49.039 --> 14:50.220
I'm not at the house because it's not in me.

14:51.281 --> 14:57.008
So I took, it was seven years before I got to write the type of life I had on the French library and had some memories of the cell phone.

14:58.051 --> 15:02.776
Actually, it's summer.

15:02.977 --> 15:03.577
It's summer.

15:03.597 --> 15:04.939
It's summer.

15:05.419 --> 15:06.521
It's summer.

15:06.621 --> 15:08.323
It's summer.

15:08.403 --> 15:09.124
All right.

15:09.224 --> 15:10.946
It's real.

15:11.226 --> 15:12.988
It's real.

15:13.468 --> 15:14.149
It's real.

15:14.229 --> 15:15.250
It's real.

15:15.591 --> 15:17.613
It's real.

15:17.693 --> 15:19.535
It's real.

15:19.595 --> 15:20.516
It's real.

15:20.577 --> 15:21.257
It's real.

15:21.578 --> 15:23.520
It's real.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.442
It's real.

15:25.793 --> 15:29.319
I don't know.

15:29.379 --> 15:35.270
I don't know.

15:36.713 --> 15:41.882
I don't know.

15:42.182 --> 15:46.189
I don't know.

15:46.550 --> 15:47.973
I don't know.

15:48.313 --> 15:50.417
I don't know.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.508
Oh, what?

15:52.849 --> 16:02.977
What conversations are you for, Joseph?

16:03.018 --> 16:10.084
He used to escape the failure.

16:10.124 --> 16:15.849
He used to escape the failure.

16:15.929 --> 16:20.893
He used to escape the failure.

16:21.768 --> 16:51.420
I have a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend who has a friend

16:52.058 --> 16:52.358
.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.120
.

16:53.661 --> 17:18.842
.

17:19.447 --> 17:47.493
As far as the early memories, you know, it's not as if for me they suddenly emerged out of nowhere.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.335
I mean, I had never forgotten the beating.

17:49.822 --> 17:52.985
My brother David was hospitalized before his suicide.

17:53.445 --> 17:59.211
He himself was having a lot of memories of the beatings and the time in Baltimore that was the worst for us.

17:59.351 --> 18:02.734
And my father was denying them that those things had happened.

18:02.754 --> 18:05.436
And I was trying to say to my brother, you're not hallucinating.

18:05.516 --> 18:07.218
Those are not hallucinations, those are memories.

18:07.238 --> 18:08.379
I remember those things too.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.542
You were there, Paul was there, I was there.

18:12.823 --> 18:16.587
And then there were lots of things that happened in the present that were undeniable.

18:16.647 --> 18:18.208
My father's still French kiss.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.669
through my 20s and 30s.

18:21.029 --> 18:25.394
I mean, that was not something that had to be reconstructed.

18:25.414 --> 18:26.835
That's not an hallucination.

18:27.235 --> 18:28.356
No, no.

18:28.376 --> 18:37.866
But so, you know, it's certainly connected with the oral rape from when I was very, very young, but it's not as if it came out of nowhere and suddenly just emerged.

18:37.886 --> 18:46.474
I don't know how memory works for some people, but I know the traumatic memory, unfortunately,

18:46.859 --> 19:12.647
re-emerges in in your body first i mean you may be in an intimate moment with a lover and you feel touched a certain way and suddenly your body seizes up and you don't understand what's wrong or you know and then the pieces kind of begin coming together um i mean i think we all experience things like that it could be the smell of something absolutely that evokes a memory of 30 years ago or whatever yeah or sound or a song you know absolutely yeah

19:12.982 --> 19:15.786
And I think some people say, well, how can you remember back to that age?

19:15.826 --> 19:20.052
You know, it's not that I only remember traumatic memories from two and a half or three.

19:20.072 --> 19:26.741
I remember the smell of the salt and pepper shaker I used to play with that was in this little donkey that I used to scoot around on the floor.

19:26.801 --> 19:30.166
I mean, so it's not as if it's just isolated things.

19:30.687 --> 19:32.329
It is fragmented memory.

19:32.409 --> 19:37.155
I mean, in a way that children, I think, have a very present-oriented sense of time.

19:37.456 --> 19:40.440
You know, when you tell a child Christmas or Hanukkah is,

19:40.707 --> 19:43.330
You know, a month away they'll wake up and say, is it Hanukkah yet?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.252
Is it Christmas yet?

19:44.272 --> 19:46.555
You know, you're in the moment.

19:46.735 --> 19:49.819
And so fear for a child works in the same way.

19:49.899 --> 19:53.383
I mean, I knew that Saturday was the day that a lot of bad things happened.

19:53.503 --> 19:54.545
You know, my brothers were beaten.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.866
I was sometimes beaten.

19:55.887 --> 19:56.968
I was sometimes molested.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.691
So every Saturday my fear went up.

19:59.792 --> 20:04.077
Now, I can't tell you that every Saturday it happened, but I can tell you that every Saturday I was afraid.

20:04.357 --> 20:05.679
And how do you feel about Saturdays now?

20:06.280 --> 20:07.982
I still have a hard time on Saturdays.

20:08.002 --> 20:08.723
I have to be...

20:09.209 --> 20:10.551
plan nice things for myself.

20:10.671 --> 20:15.037
I have to not watch movies that are too dark.

20:17.080 --> 20:22.067
And of course, the therapy was essential to this whole... Absolutely, absolutely.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.070
Where would you be now without it, do you think?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.893
I mean, certainly suicide or something.

20:25.913 --> 20:26.053
Dead?

20:26.734 --> 20:27.835
Probably dead.

20:27.855 --> 20:32.442
I, you know, made two very serious suicide times.

20:32.462 --> 20:38.811
And I think, in the same way that I think therapy and being able to tell my story to someone who would listen,

20:39.162 --> 20:44.667
to listen and understand trauma was what saved me.

20:44.807 --> 20:47.389
Also friendships, being able to connect to people.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.611
But I also think it would have saved my brothers.

20:50.312 --> 20:53.895
I think that my brother David, we had already been through one suicide.

20:54.456 --> 20:55.557
My brother Paul had died.

20:55.597 --> 21:01.622
The fact that when my brother David was in the hospital and the psychiatrist asked my father, has there ever been any trauma in your family?

21:01.642 --> 21:02.203
He said no.

21:03.084 --> 21:07.988
His need to present things, to present a false narrative

21:08.693 --> 21:13.017
of a picture-perfect family was so great that he couldn't even save his second son.

21:13.217 --> 21:15.520
He desperately needed to talk about what he's doing after.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.443
Well, you say here that, you know, I forget who it was who told you, there are no such things as accidents.

21:20.164 --> 21:22.867
I had a therapist tell me that, and there were my brothers.

21:22.927 --> 21:24.128
I think I agree with that.

21:24.148 --> 21:25.309
You do, yeah.

21:25.329 --> 21:28.512
Well, I mean, if something falls on my head on the street, I mean, that's an accident.

21:28.592 --> 21:30.194
I have no control over it.

21:30.254 --> 21:31.315
Right.

21:31.395 --> 21:35.779
But if I continually walk under a place where there's scaffolding and maybe I'm inviting, you know, who knows?

21:35.799 --> 21:35.899
Yeah.

21:36.267 --> 21:39.832
I don't know, but I think there's a lot of truth to that.

21:40.072 --> 21:42.275
I think to be that simplistic with it.

21:42.295 --> 21:43.677
Yeah, yeah.

21:43.697 --> 21:45.839
He certainly was crying out for something.

21:45.859 --> 21:48.122
He was crying out for help in a very big way.

21:48.262 --> 21:50.025
He was challenging that with the speed.

21:50.085 --> 21:51.887
Absolutely, absolutely.

21:51.907 --> 21:52.608
I did the same thing.

21:52.648 --> 21:53.309
I know it well.

21:53.329 --> 21:54.450
I know that behavior well.

21:55.472 --> 22:05.785
And I think, I don't know, I think the sad thing for me today is my father, who's in his 70s, has lost two sons to suicide, almost lost a daughter.

22:06.136 --> 22:07.717
We're not in contact at all.

22:08.198 --> 22:11.381
And he still hangs on to his story.

22:11.981 --> 22:12.902
Everything is fine.

22:12.922 --> 22:14.544
We had a wonderful, happy childhood.

22:15.144 --> 22:16.806
These things were just flukes that happened.

22:16.926 --> 22:22.271
So you don't know whether or not this book has reached that?

22:22.551 --> 22:23.632
No, I do know it reached them.

22:23.692 --> 22:32.580
In December, early December, I sent my mother a proof, an advanced galley, because I wanted to make sure that they had read it before it came out.

22:32.740 --> 22:35.923
I thought it was immoral.

22:36.140 --> 22:40.925
publish this if it's so much about them and not give them a chance to release and see it.

22:40.945 --> 22:47.071
And I also told them that the Today Show would be happening and gave them time to prepare for that and so forth.

22:47.572 --> 22:54.258
In the Today Show, they did contact my parents and my father asked them to film him preaching in his church.

22:55.079 --> 22:58.863
And his church said, no, we don't want to be any part of this.

22:58.883 --> 23:02.907
This could be scandalous for the denomination for the church.

23:03.747 --> 23:14.761
He said, well, then I'll only be interviewed on a condition that I can have someone from the False Memory Syndrome Foundation sitting by my side for the interview, and NBC said no.

23:15.582 --> 23:19.928
So you expect that this is going to be the formal response?

23:20.088 --> 23:24.774
Oh, I know the formal response, which will be that I'm experiencing false memories, and that this is all.

23:25.074 --> 23:27.818
And that you're blaming your father for the deaths of your brothers.

23:27.858 --> 23:29.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:30.022 --> 23:35.507
The interesting thing is that over the last six years, my father himself has blamed various people.

23:36.888 --> 23:43.273
At first, he blamed the therapist that these ideas were put into my head, when in fact I wasn't even in therapy when the intrusive memories began.

23:45.255 --> 23:53.883
Second, he blamed a church janitor, which really went against my own memory of being helped by a very kind church janitor in Baltimore when I was very little.

23:54.583 --> 24:00.028
Then he blamed a babysitter, and as recently as a year ago, sent me a letter saying,

24:00.127 --> 24:02.890
this is who you should be going after.

24:04.251 --> 24:10.177
And named the babysitter, said you should deposition him, you should prosecute, etc., etc.

24:10.197 --> 24:17.243
And my husband said, you know, if your father truly believes that this babysitter did this to you, why didn't he walk you years ago?

24:17.664 --> 24:20.306
Where was he?

24:20.687 --> 24:24.670
Who do you think is the reader for this book?

24:25.211 --> 24:26.132
I have a hopeful reader.

24:26.492 --> 24:29.475
My most hopeful reader is other survivors.

24:30.029 --> 24:33.314
who are struggling with their own ability to stay in life.

24:33.334 --> 24:37.439
I mean, maybe that's a wish to save in a way that I couldn't save my brothers.

24:37.740 --> 24:48.014
I mean, sometimes I think a book can be as much community or company or a light in darkness as a person.

24:48.034 --> 24:53.561
And sometimes someone who's feeling great shame and aloneness will turn to a book before they turn to a person.

24:53.581 --> 24:57.707
And I'm hoping maybe they'll turn to the book and then turn to someone for help.

24:58.227 --> 25:01.070
Do you expect to talk to your father again?

25:01.091 --> 25:01.912
I don't expect to.

25:02.332 --> 25:03.253
I don't expect to.

25:04.314 --> 25:05.316
I feel sad about that.

25:05.396 --> 25:09.301
But as long as his position remains, none of this happens.

25:09.321 --> 25:11.704
I feel invisible.

25:12.024 --> 25:15.468
I wonder what the reaction of the church is.

25:15.949 --> 25:16.389
I don't know.

25:16.650 --> 25:18.131
That's a good question.

25:18.151 --> 25:24.339
I'm glad that they refused to support him by having him videotaped.

25:24.359 --> 25:27.643
Because I think as a little kid, I often felt that the church was sort of

25:28.484 --> 25:32.268
with my father and the things he'd done to us because some of them took place in the church.

25:33.669 --> 25:37.112
You also mentioned that you're curious of being a drunk user in the church.

25:38.173 --> 25:38.734
Absolutely.

25:38.834 --> 25:40.495
Absolutely.

25:40.615 --> 25:41.356
From the pulpit.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.838
Cigarette tapers in the car.

25:42.858 --> 25:43.138
Yes.

25:43.158 --> 25:51.005
So we've already had, he's already exposed me, you know, in many, many ways from the pulpit, which is sad.

25:51.025 --> 25:54.268
So what kind of feelings do you have for your father?

25:54.549 --> 25:55.410
I still love him.

25:55.430 --> 25:58.052
I think there's still a very childlike part of me.

25:58.302 --> 26:06.391
that wishes he would take responsibility for what he'd done and try to make peace with his family and peace with his dead sons and peace with his God somehow.

26:06.411 --> 26:17.083
Because you mentioned when you were playing, I mean, recently, in the last 10 or 15 minutes, you're still trying, you're still aiming for his approbation, I guess, his approval.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.085
That mattered to you, I guess.

26:19.105 --> 26:19.566
It did matter.

26:19.586 --> 26:27.094
And I think what's been so difficult about the piano is that here was this thing given to me

26:27.361 --> 26:30.886
to bargain for my silence on the one hand, but it was also what saved my life.

26:31.106 --> 26:35.712
And the music was really what saved me, I think, through my whole growing up.

26:36.953 --> 26:38.195
And the audio.

26:38.215 --> 26:40.398
And I got to play the music.

26:40.418 --> 26:40.899
That's great.

26:40.919 --> 26:44.223
So I got to play the music I chose, and I got to read.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.406
And it was just really wonderful.

26:46.426 --> 26:47.387
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

26:50.030 --> 26:52.253
What's the total running time on this, I wonder?

26:52.273 --> 26:56.138
A little under three hours.

26:56.158 --> 26:56.659
It's today, 22.

26:57.044 --> 27:14.614
I was right.
