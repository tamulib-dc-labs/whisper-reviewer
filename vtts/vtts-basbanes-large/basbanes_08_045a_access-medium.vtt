WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:08.747
We're talking to Elmore Leonard, and it's May 25th, which happens to be my 52nd birthday.

00:09.008 --> 00:12.634
Oh, you know, Shakespeare died on his 52nd birthday, you know.

00:12.654 --> 00:12.894
He did.

00:12.914 --> 00:14.857
Yeah, April 23rd, 1516.

00:14.998 --> 00:19.465
So don't think I haven't been looking at this day with a degree of dread.

00:19.485 --> 00:21.829
1516, right?

00:21.849 --> 00:25.475
1516, yeah, he was 52 on his April 23rd.

00:25.896 --> 00:27.338
But anyway...

00:27.571 --> 00:37.406
I'm really, I think this is, I've got about 50 pages to go, but I'm really thinking this is as good a No More Leonard as I've read in a long time.

00:37.426 --> 00:37.806
It's terrific.

00:37.826 --> 00:42.894
Yeah, you know, and it's funny when people have said that about this book.

00:43.455 --> 00:44.957
I don't see anything different about it.

00:45.458 --> 00:49.484
You know, I think, oh my God, people are going to say, well, he's doing the same thing.

00:49.504 --> 00:52.468
He's working the same ground, the same types of people.

00:52.668 --> 00:53.089
Yeah.

00:53.356 --> 00:58.663
And I said, well, they are, but I changed their names, of course, in each book.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.525
But they're the kind of people I enjoy.

01:00.545 --> 01:10.437
I get a Hispanic, and I get a black guy, and I get an A-seed, and get them talking, and away we go.

01:10.858 --> 01:12.880
Well, but I have a feeling about this guy, Raylan.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.103
I mean, he took over the last novel.

01:16.124 --> 01:18.587
He took over because...

01:18.770 --> 01:24.559
He took over because I thought Harry Arnold was going to be the main character.

01:24.659 --> 01:25.801
Well, it started that way.

01:25.861 --> 01:26.202
Yeah.

01:26.322 --> 01:27.684
They turned out to be a drunk captain.

01:27.744 --> 01:32.792
Well, he got to Italy, and the weather, it was colder than he expected.

01:33.373 --> 01:35.997
And this wasn't planned, you see.

01:36.418 --> 01:43.709
He gets to Italy, where he's been dying to retire to for, what, 25 years or more than that.

01:43.729 --> 01:44.470
More than that.

01:44.490 --> 01:46.954
More than that, since 45, yeah.

01:47.288 --> 02:11.237
and uh 40 something years and he gets there and it isn't the way he expected it would be and he begins to moan and groan and starts to drink and I thought I can't go another in the manuscript I can't go another 250 pages with this guy so I better bring Raylan along and make him

02:11.487 --> 02:14.872
the main character, and he was introduced like on page 40.

02:14.932 --> 02:17.415
Oh, he was really a bumpkin at the beginning of the novel.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.640
Yeah, yeah, he wasn't, I didn't know what I was going to do with him.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.683
But he becomes a terrific investigator.

02:22.703 --> 02:35.681
But then as soon as I realized that Raylan's going to have to carry the story, I went back and changed his background from western Kentucky to eastern Kentucky, the deep coal mine area.

02:35.701 --> 02:36.562
That's important.

02:36.582 --> 02:38.845
Yeah, because then it gave him a background, it gave him a

02:39.297 --> 02:42.741
He had been exposed to violence.

02:42.761 --> 02:46.846
And handled it very well, as most people.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.548
That was Harlan County, I guess.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.591
Harlan County, yeah.

02:50.931 --> 03:07.431
And for the research then, I looked at that documentary, Bloody Harlan, that won an Oscar about, I don't know, 1972 or three or something like that, which covered that year-long coal mine strike.

03:08.896 --> 03:12.742
So I gather clearly you like this guy.

03:12.862 --> 03:13.343
Oh, yeah.

03:13.804 --> 03:21.716
I can, I can, yeah, because, yeah, because my eight Westerns all had a guy like, like Raylan in them, you know?

03:22.257 --> 03:25.522
But I mean, it's, it's curious.

03:25.903 --> 03:30.510
You developed him in the previous novel because you didn't like the way Harry was going.

03:30.550 --> 03:30.830
Yeah.

03:30.850 --> 03:32.172
Like, I need something here.

03:32.192 --> 03:32.914
We got to do something.

03:32.934 --> 03:33.054
Right.

03:33.715 --> 03:36.439
And this guy you create, he becomes so good.

03:37.111 --> 03:41.258
And now Harry is just a shadow.

03:41.318 --> 03:44.063
I mean, he's the reason for the investigation.

03:44.423 --> 03:44.984
Right, right.

03:45.345 --> 03:47.068
But he still has a personality.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.731
He has a personality.

03:48.751 --> 03:49.913
He's funny and he's smart.

03:50.213 --> 03:50.453
Yeah.

03:50.934 --> 03:53.238
And he's wise in his own way.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.363
And he knows how to stay alive, certainly, which is important.

03:56.383 --> 03:56.484
Yeah.

03:56.504 --> 03:59.308
I mean, the golfer doesn't know how to stay alive.

03:59.769 --> 04:00.891
No, no.

04:02.052 --> 04:05.057
Tell me a little bit about this now, about Waylon.

04:05.758 --> 04:10.264
I mean, you've had a couple of characters over the years that you've stuck with.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.186
Yeah, yeah.

04:11.446 --> 04:12.047
A couple of books.

04:12.087 --> 04:21.221
There was a Jack Ryan who was in The Big Bounce, which was my first non-Western.

04:21.902 --> 04:25.147
And then he was in... What was he in?

04:26.809 --> 04:28.592
He was in Unknown Man No.

04:28.612 --> 04:29.393
89...

04:30.335 --> 04:34.922
And then Stick was in, what was he in?

04:38.247 --> 04:50.104
Swag, but before that he was in... Swag, the switch?

04:50.324 --> 04:56.974
No, that wasn't it.

04:57.255 --> 04:57.595
No.

04:57.635 --> 04:58.857
There they are.

04:59.123 --> 05:08.213
That's all right.

05:08.233 --> 05:08.633
I'll find it.

05:08.773 --> 05:22.528
I got most of these.

05:22.548 --> 05:22.968
Don't worry about it.

05:22.988 --> 05:23.189
All right.

05:23.869 --> 05:26.312
Anyway, so we've got Raylan here.

05:27.322 --> 05:31.167
He's really, yes, the character has changed a little bit to a degree.

05:31.207 --> 05:34.591
I mean, he is really a terrific investigator now, I think.

05:34.691 --> 05:35.432
I mean, he's very good.

05:35.552 --> 05:35.893
Yeah.

05:36.474 --> 05:43.282
Because I don't do much investigating in any of my books when I have a cop in there.

05:43.422 --> 05:46.787
You know, he's... Well, this guy's doing some serious investigating.

05:46.807 --> 05:47.387
Yeah.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.609
Go ahead, I'm sorry I interrupted you.

05:48.629 --> 05:54.156
But, because I've only done one that you might call the procedural, City Primeval, where...

05:54.355 --> 05:58.480
You're with the cops, and you're with the cops all the way through, you know?

05:59.441 --> 06:14.399
And so, and he doesn't really do any investigating in Prado, so now when he is, now he's looking for somebody, he is investigating, so I have to, let's see him investigate, you know?

06:15.400 --> 06:23.890
This Don character has some resonance from that other novel that you did that was kind of off the menu, so remember the one...

06:24.308 --> 06:24.789
Touch?

06:24.809 --> 06:25.770
Touch, yeah.

06:25.991 --> 06:26.211
Touch.

06:26.672 --> 06:28.274
I mean, she does have some gifts here.

06:28.334 --> 06:30.197
A little, yeah, but you're not sure.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.040
Right.

06:32.120 --> 06:32.841
Yes, you're right.

06:32.881 --> 06:36.326
There are times when she must be psychic.

06:36.346 --> 06:37.388
Don't forget, I haven't finished.

06:37.428 --> 06:41.514
I've got about 50 pages to go, but she does seem to have some... Yeah.

06:41.695 --> 06:43.738
She's an incredibly propitious woman.

06:43.758 --> 06:44.920
Of course, she knows a lot of other things.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.468
She knows a lot of things, but, yeah, she picks up on the fact that

06:52.203 --> 06:54.265
Maybe she guessed he was a coal miner.

06:55.446 --> 06:55.787
Maybe.

06:55.907 --> 06:57.609
I don't know.

06:57.769 --> 07:01.232
But she was talking to Chip in one scene on the phone.

07:01.412 --> 07:05.056
Oh, no, she's outside on the video camera right there.

07:05.276 --> 07:08.420
But she says, she said to Chip, turn the light on.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.381
I can't see you.

07:10.422 --> 07:10.542
Ah.

07:12.924 --> 07:16.108
Not right now.

07:17.069 --> 07:17.209
Yeah.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.472
Yeah, I have to, well, I had to do them.

07:20.772 --> 07:24.556
You have to see him doing some police work if that's what he is, you know.

07:25.777 --> 07:32.744
And he will cut corners, but he won't just walk into Gans' house.

07:32.784 --> 07:36.729
Well, like the girlfriend has a hard time figuring out how he can shoot the guy.

07:36.749 --> 07:37.870
Yeah.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.973
But he can't walk in the house without a warning.

07:41.053 --> 07:46.038
I mean, she can't seem to reconcile these parts of his character.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.160
And he says, if you can't, then you can't.

07:48.200 --> 07:48.921
And you don't know me.

07:49.262 --> 07:49.682
I mean, this is.

07:49.898 --> 07:51.701
But I seem to understand it perfectly.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.623
Yeah, yeah.

07:52.984 --> 07:54.647
But the thing is, yeah.

07:54.667 --> 07:54.767
Yeah.

07:54.787 --> 07:57.271
And I have a scene where he is talking to another cop.

07:57.452 --> 07:57.572
Right.

07:57.592 --> 07:59.736
And he asks the cop, have you ever shot anybody?

08:00.117 --> 08:01.599
They both have shot two guys.

08:01.619 --> 08:07.069
And you know when you have, they both agree, you know when you have to shoot somebody.

08:07.129 --> 08:09.173
And, you know, so don't worry about it.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.511
How do you know so much, I mean, about these cops?

08:11.531 --> 08:13.173
I mean, do you talk with a lot of cops?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.073
Do you ride with them?

08:14.534 --> 08:19.579
Yeah, I talk to a young guy who's with Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

08:19.619 --> 08:22.642
He's probably, I don't know, 36 years old now.

08:23.743 --> 08:25.624
He had been a probation officer.

08:25.644 --> 08:26.785
He had been with DEA.

08:27.546 --> 08:29.348
Now he's FDLE.

08:30.129 --> 08:36.915
And he has held a gun on a guy and thought he was going to probably have to shoot him.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.306
But the guy finally put his gun down.

08:40.948 --> 08:49.759
And he said he doesn't know a cop who has shot anyone who didn't feel ill after.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.181
Physically.

08:51.221 --> 08:52.222
Physically ill.

08:55.186 --> 09:00.813
And the scam they're working on is pretty, actually, if you had some clever people, it's not a bad scam.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.415
It might work.

09:02.595 --> 09:06.160
You know, you had some guys that are dirty.

09:06.764 --> 09:08.967
the money, and if you can reason with them.

09:10.048 --> 09:16.295
I mean... Oh, I think it could have... You don't extract the money from the relatives, you extract the money from the individual.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.798
Yeah, I think it could have worked.

09:18.978 --> 09:30.612
And as Chip Gans says, you pick guys who are larcenous in themselves, or

09:31.098 --> 09:32.940
Like the SNL guy, or Harry.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.425
We don't really grieve at his passing either, do we?

09:36.505 --> 09:37.726
Right, right, right.

09:38.447 --> 09:47.819
But of course, the purpose of that, of the scene, is to show the viciousness of Bobby Dale.

09:47.859 --> 09:49.581
The fact that, boy, you've got to watch it.

09:49.601 --> 09:51.604
It raises the stakes to a very real level.

09:51.964 --> 09:56.490
I think we all know what we're dealing with here.

09:56.510 --> 09:56.610
Yeah.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.113
My editor suggested...

09:59.701 --> 10:08.332
She said, I'd like to see the bad guys do something bad early on, at least before page 100.

10:08.973 --> 10:18.085
So I added a scene where Bobby Dale and Lewis are going into the grocery store.

10:18.246 --> 10:18.886
Yeah.

10:18.906 --> 10:23.833
And you don't know when that scene's over whether he cut the woman's finger off.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.795
Or whether he killed her, too.

10:25.816 --> 10:26.516
That's right.

10:26.536 --> 10:26.717
Yeah.

10:26.857 --> 10:26.957
Yeah.

10:27.308 --> 10:29.951
And he doesn't tell Lewis when he gets out.

10:30.032 --> 10:30.993
No, no.

10:31.453 --> 10:32.174
That's right.

10:32.194 --> 10:32.715
No.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.579
And then he didn't even want the ring when he looked at it.

10:36.740 --> 10:37.421
He left the ring.

10:37.461 --> 10:39.083
That's right.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.987
Yeah.

10:42.007 --> 10:49.577
There was a scene in Glitz where what was the guy's name?

10:49.757 --> 10:50.598
Vincent Mora.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.280
He's up in the hotel room.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.826
He's in bed with the woman when

10:57.160 --> 11:26.610
the guy tries to kill him and shoots through the door or bangs the door open and fires some shots and runs and Vincent grabs his automatic and runs down the hall after him and down the stairs and he's outside in his underwear as the guy drives off and from her point of view looking down she sees him say something she sees the guy say something to Vincent and then Vincent comes back up and I didn't know what the guy

11:27.097 --> 11:56.395
said to him i wanted i said to be pretty good line you know and i didn't have a good line that day so he didn't he didn't he didn't tell her what the guy said but there might have been some mention about the guy saying something to him but then i went on with the story and by then i i figured out what the guy said to him it's something about betting your why didn't you bet your underwear or something you know if you

11:56.746 --> 12:01.452
and put it in later when he's talking to somebody else.

12:01.973 --> 12:02.173
See?

12:04.656 --> 12:25.943
You know, I never talk about these blurbs from other writers, but I think I will in this particular piece, because it really is, and writers I've talked to over the years, I mean, it must be something to have the kind of respect that you have from other writers, and it's so apparent.

12:26.868 --> 12:36.866
I like that Pete Dexter blurb.

12:39.771 --> 12:49.168
He says, Elmore Leonard makes me happy.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.530
Isn't that nice?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.428
I like his new book.

12:52.448 --> 12:53.730
Have you read his new book?

12:53.930 --> 12:54.371
I have it.

12:54.391 --> 12:55.433
I haven't read it yet.

12:55.673 --> 12:56.715
Yeah, it's good.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.015
It's good.

12:57.035 --> 12:57.636
It's very good.

12:57.656 --> 13:00.020
He's really got the sense of the newspaper business in there.

13:00.521 --> 13:01.843
And it's a flower set in Florida.

13:01.903 --> 13:02.244
Yeah.

13:02.484 --> 13:04.688
He kind of moved the action to Florida lately.

13:04.728 --> 13:08.434
Well, yeah, but I'm 50 pages into a book.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.499
And I was talking to my editor last month.

13:11.599 --> 13:15.265
And I said, I want to move this story somewhere else.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.428
And she said, why don't you take it back to Detroit?

13:17.678 --> 13:20.923
I said, yeah, well, if I can see a way to do it, I will.

13:21.224 --> 13:28.255
And so I've been plotting, not plotting, but I've been figuring out just an idea how to do it, and I'm going to do that.

13:28.936 --> 13:33.684
Because there really is something unique about Detroit, isn't it?

13:33.704 --> 13:34.725
There is.

13:35.046 --> 13:36.468
How many people write about it, too?

13:36.809 --> 13:37.109
No.

13:37.910 --> 13:38.692
Lauren Esselman.

13:39.753 --> 13:43.399
And it's pretty desolate now.

13:43.902 --> 13:51.133
You know, there's no real color there, but perhaps that's what's colorful about it, that it's just kind of a dump.

13:51.614 --> 13:52.695
Is that Detroit?

13:52.715 --> 13:52.915
Yeah.

13:52.935 --> 13:54.017
Oh, it's tough, yeah.

13:54.197 --> 13:54.798
It's tough.

13:55.019 --> 13:56.260
Oh, yeah.

13:56.521 --> 13:59.105
South Florida.

13:59.125 --> 14:02.790
You don't fool around with it.

14:02.810 --> 14:03.051
No.

14:03.351 --> 14:06.115
But the thing about Detroit downtown, it's deserted.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.419
You know, there's nothing going on.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.745
When I was out there a couple of years ago, there was a new stretcher.

14:13.248 --> 14:25.843
from my own book, a nonfiction book, a guy was driving me around and he said, you should show me another major metropolitan city in the United States where the interstates are actually designed to go around, go through the city.

14:25.863 --> 14:29.608
I mean, not to connect you with the city, to connect the suburbs to the suburbs.

14:30.469 --> 14:36.816
I forget the name of the interstate we were driving, you know, one of these connectors, you know, how close the point.

14:37.157 --> 14:39.540
Yeah, 696 probably.

14:39.560 --> 14:39.760
Yeah.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.343
There's no easy way to get into the city.

14:42.627 --> 14:46.973
In fact, it's all concrete, so the city can't get out here.

14:47.413 --> 14:50.998
It's really interesting how they really insulated themselves from the inner city.

14:52.160 --> 15:01.372
Yeah, all the brand new buildings that you see in most big cities now are all out in the suburbs.

15:01.732 --> 15:08.922
Except a city like this, in Detroit's case, all the major businesses have left, so there's no reason for a middle class.

15:09.998 --> 15:11.240
That's right.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.261
Yeah.

15:12.402 --> 15:16.768
We drive around through Bloomfield Hills, and I wonder, what do all these people do, you know?

15:18.972 --> 15:22.617
So, how many, what's the number now?

15:22.637 --> 15:22.697
32.

15:22.857 --> 15:23.158
32.

15:23.218 --> 15:29.027
You don't have any trouble, right, coming up with that?

15:29.047 --> 15:39.162
Well, I don't worry about ideas, because I think you just, you have to stay, you have to keep your eyes open and stay current.

15:39.850 --> 15:47.199
And my books really aren't topical, but I do try and keep up with what's going on.

15:47.219 --> 15:49.482
A lot of the cardjacking references in here.

15:49.522 --> 15:52.726
That's very definitely a phenomenon over the last couple of years.

15:53.367 --> 15:57.692
And when you say the state attorneys, no way they're going to let a guy cop on cardjacking.

15:57.712 --> 16:01.276
You really got to know how serious cardjacking is, especially in Florida.

16:01.296 --> 16:01.577
Right.

16:01.957 --> 16:02.838
To pick up on that.

16:02.858 --> 16:04.921
Yeah, but I'm not going to go into any detail on it.

16:04.941 --> 16:05.802
No, but I think we all know.

16:05.822 --> 16:06.082
Yeah.

16:06.483 --> 16:08.305
20, 30 years from now, though, they're going to say,

16:08.825 --> 16:13.612
a reader's going to say, I don't know, who knows, but who cares?

16:13.632 --> 16:16.957
I don't worry about that.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.339
I don't worry about that.

16:18.780 --> 16:21.544
Do you have in your mind, I mean, are you competing with anybody?

16:21.764 --> 16:22.085
No.

16:22.245 --> 16:25.270
Oh, no, no, no.

16:25.410 --> 16:33.722
Are you overly concerned about how you are regarded, you know, as a literary writer or genre writer?

16:35.625 --> 16:37.027
No, no, no.

16:37.088 --> 16:38.089
And I think...

16:38.423 --> 16:44.552
Martin Amos, in his review in the Times, hit it on the head.

16:44.572 --> 16:47.096
He said, he's a genre writer, you know?

16:47.156 --> 16:47.898
That's what I am.

16:47.938 --> 16:50.001
I write crime novels.

16:50.021 --> 16:53.226
I used to write westerns.

16:53.306 --> 16:55.469
But he's the best at what he does also.

16:55.529 --> 16:56.671
I think he added that, too.

16:56.771 --> 17:02.480
I mean, I think Amos also said, is this just the first one?

17:02.500 --> 17:02.700
No.

17:03.221 --> 17:05.825
But he said he has to go out and read them all.

17:05.845 --> 17:07.688
Well, he's...

17:08.309 --> 17:23.143
I've read in interviews with him, or interviews that he's written, he mentions me, and this is probably the, well now this is a review, but he's mentioned me several times before.

17:24.224 --> 17:30.450
And I wondered, the first time was in Interview Magazine, and the writer asked him, who do you read in the United States?

17:30.470 --> 17:32.673
And he said, Don DeLillo and El Moran.

17:32.693 --> 17:37.337
I said, Don DeLillo, Jesus.

17:37.925 --> 17:44.558
And Martin Amos and I, our styles couldn't be farther apart.

17:44.658 --> 17:46.542
I mean, he uses a lot of words.

17:46.562 --> 17:50.649
He's got a lot of... I didn't have him with him a couple of weeks ago.

17:50.669 --> 17:50.830
You did?

17:50.930 --> 17:51.030
Yeah.

17:51.050 --> 17:52.433
How old is he?

17:52.994 --> 17:54.377
Better than I expected.

17:54.517 --> 17:54.617
Yeah?

17:55.357 --> 17:57.579
That's a very, that's a non-committal answer.

17:57.599 --> 17:59.601
Well, I kind of know what you mean, dude.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.903
I expected this kid with a sneer in his face.

18:01.923 --> 18:02.283
Yeah?

18:02.503 --> 18:05.866
And he was, you know, put the teeth were bothering him, by the way.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.429
Oh, he had his teeth fixed, that's right.

18:08.449 --> 18:08.809
Yeah.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.692
But I had a very good interview with him.

18:11.712 --> 18:11.952
Yeah.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.296
I placed it in a lot of papers, and I got it in Milwaukee.

18:16.316 --> 18:20.059
I have papers that take me every week, and then I also kind of do enterprise.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.081
You know, like, I'll try to place this.

18:22.341 --> 18:24.503
I will place this in a number of newspapers.

18:25.242 --> 18:28.285
in addition to the ones that take my feature every week.

18:28.305 --> 18:30.447
I've become kind of entrepreneurial about it.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.010
Are you going to Milwaukee, for instance?

18:33.090 --> 18:33.911
No, no.

18:33.931 --> 18:36.954
You know, I might be able to place this out in Milwaukee.

18:36.974 --> 18:37.275
Uh-huh.

18:39.717 --> 18:39.997
But we'll see.

18:40.017 --> 18:42.320
Yeah, my daughter went to school at Marquette.

18:43.121 --> 18:43.561
Is that right?

18:43.982 --> 18:45.003
Yeah.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.505
And I have a granddaughter, in fact, at Marquette right now.

18:47.986 --> 18:50.468
Well, Grand Rapids takes me a couple times a month.

18:50.488 --> 18:50.669
Yeah.

18:50.809 --> 18:52.971
So for sure I'll be able to live in Grand Rapids.

18:54.622 --> 19:05.320
So we were talking about, you know, this sense of literary standing and all this, you don't have any, that kind of stuff doesn't enter your mind at all.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.965
Oh, no, no, uh-uh.

19:07.985 --> 19:20.646
No, and I'm not that involved with other writers or writers' groups, and lately I've had to go to New York for Mystery Writers of America functions.

19:21.217 --> 19:27.443
because I was a president a few years ago, and then the next year I was a Grand Master, got the Grand Master Award.

19:28.524 --> 19:45.200
And then this year, I was the chairman of the Grand Master Committee, and I selected three guys or four guys that I knew liked Mickey Spillane a lot, and we worked it so that Mickey Spillane got it.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.603
That's kind of like a Lifetime Achievement Award, right?

19:47.723 --> 19:48.123
Yeah, yeah.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.886
You've got to be... Tony Hillerman says it's...

19:51.271 --> 19:54.994
You join the over-the-hill gang, then, with that.

19:55.655 --> 19:57.317
Well, over-the-hill baloney.

19:57.337 --> 20:00.319
But you do have to have been doing it for a while.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.802
It's not for the novice.

20:02.822 --> 20:08.387
It's not rookie of the year, let's put it that way.

20:08.407 --> 20:08.507
Yeah.

20:08.527 --> 20:13.212
So that's the only association I have, really, with other writers.

20:13.932 --> 20:16.335
Once in a while, I'll go to a writer's conference.

20:18.336 --> 20:19.017
But I don't...

20:19.452 --> 20:21.695
I don't sit around talking about writing.

20:21.775 --> 20:28.765
I certainly don't go to these writers' clubs where they read their stuff to each other.

20:28.785 --> 20:29.746
I don't believe in that.

20:31.188 --> 20:35.093
Who do you read?

20:35.113 --> 20:41.562
Well, I like short stories.

20:41.845 --> 20:44.768
I read more short stories probably than novels.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.370
Although, well lately I'd say like Cormac McCarthy.

20:47.470 --> 20:48.632
I think he's great.

20:48.672 --> 20:50.593
The last two horse books that he did.

20:52.375 --> 20:56.019
Who else?

20:56.259 --> 20:58.041
A crime novel, Dirty White Boys.

20:58.381 --> 20:59.142
Did you read that?

20:59.522 --> 20:59.582
No.

20:59.602 --> 21:00.563
That's a good book.

21:00.583 --> 21:01.784
I love that.

21:01.804 --> 21:02.745
Can't think of his name.

21:02.765 --> 21:05.648
It's a real violent, violent book.

21:05.908 --> 21:08.251
Not as violent as it could be.

21:08.871 --> 21:09.912
No, this isn't violent.

21:09.932 --> 21:11.734
I've only seen one so far.

21:11.883 --> 21:13.606
No, no.

21:16.390 --> 21:26.988
No, I try and make my violence when somebody shoots somebody a little unexpected, and usually I just say, shot him, you know, let it go at that.

21:27.008 --> 21:32.397
When Bobby goes in and does the golf with King there, that's violence.

21:32.437 --> 21:34.280
I think we know that's what's going to happen.

21:35.141 --> 21:35.822
Oh, did you?

21:35.842 --> 21:36.844
Yeah, well, I thought.

21:37.347 --> 21:41.353
Well, he, because we're watching... Well, that's a tribute, I think, to your writing, too.

21:41.373 --> 21:43.837
I think it was in character for him to go in and do it.

21:43.857 --> 21:50.387
Well, we're watching it on TV, and I think Lewis is now going to go in and beat him up.

21:50.407 --> 21:53.272
Well, you set it up, and you said they watched, and what they saw was this.

21:53.452 --> 21:59.041
As soon as I saw that colon there, I knew the description.

21:59.061 --> 22:00.263
Well, you're a writer.

22:00.283 --> 22:02.967
I'm looking at craft here, and I think...

22:03.132 --> 22:07.858
He's going to remove himself from just a tad now so he can describe what they see on the TV screen.

22:08.019 --> 22:10.242
I thought it was very cleverly done.

22:10.262 --> 22:10.362
Yeah.

22:10.382 --> 22:12.345
It was very nicely done.

22:12.985 --> 22:16.510
You started off, you said earlier, as a writer of Westerns.

22:16.530 --> 22:17.331
Mm-hmm.

22:17.572 --> 22:21.757
And several of which I believe were made into films, right?

22:21.837 --> 22:22.178
Yeah.

22:22.358 --> 22:29.748
310 to Yuma, Hombre, Valdez is Coming, The Tall Tee, Joe Kidd.

22:29.768 --> 22:32.532
That was an original screenplay for Eastwood.

22:33.322 --> 22:34.663
And so you just made the move?

22:36.385 --> 22:39.128
I had to because... Did you consider yourself a writer of Westerns?

22:39.208 --> 22:42.191
I mean, were you Louis L'Amour from Detroit at that point?

22:42.211 --> 22:46.536
There was no... I thought I wrote pretty good Westerns.

22:46.696 --> 22:48.698
What I'm saying is you just made the move like that.

22:48.718 --> 22:56.126
Well, I made the move because the market dried up for Westerns because of TV.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.208
All the Westerns were on TV.

22:58.228 --> 23:03.193
There were no more... By 59, 60, there were very few Western movies.

23:03.427 --> 23:05.369
And all the pulps were gone by then.

23:05.409 --> 23:09.273
Dime Western, Zane Gray Western, they were paying two cents a word.

23:09.313 --> 23:13.277
So you could always send them 5,000 words and get 100 bucks.

23:13.297 --> 23:13.577
See?

23:13.597 --> 23:15.179
And I sold about 30 of those.

23:15.419 --> 23:17.041
How long would it take you to do something like that?

23:17.061 --> 23:18.522
A week or so.

23:18.542 --> 23:19.924
Which wasn't bad in the 50s.

23:20.344 --> 23:20.524
You know?

23:20.544 --> 23:21.805
That's a lot of work for 100 bucks.

23:21.825 --> 23:27.251
Because I wasn't, well, it's a lot of work, but I wasn't making.

23:27.271 --> 23:29.233
$100 was a lot of money back in the 50s.

23:29.253 --> 23:31.375
$100, that's $5,000.

23:31.574 --> 23:32.736
I wasn't making $5,000.

23:33.116 --> 23:38.905
I was making like $250 a month at an ad agency when I started out.

23:40.167 --> 23:43.592
I started out, I was $125 a month.

23:43.733 --> 23:50.162
I was their first, the agency, I can't believe all Chevrolet, I was their first married office boy.

23:51.605 --> 23:53.267
And then I got raised to $135.

23:53.327 --> 23:56.853
Then I got put into a traffic department.

23:56.873 --> 23:58.375
I was making $250.

23:58.962 --> 24:07.013
And I left and got a job as an ad writer and then came back 15 months later as a writer on Chevrolet.

24:07.293 --> 24:08.555
This is up in Detroit.

24:09.276 --> 24:09.456
Yeah.

24:09.677 --> 24:11.880
So I wrote car ads for seven years.

24:11.900 --> 24:16.806
As soon as my profit sharing came due, I left.

24:16.827 --> 24:21.273
And so what prompted you to write your first Westerns?

24:21.413 --> 24:23.075
I thought Westerns, I liked Westerns.

24:23.396 --> 24:25.158
I mean, I like Western movies.

24:25.178 --> 24:28.142
I didn't write, I hadn't read many Westerns

24:28.477 --> 24:55.463
uh in the magazines outside of in saturday evening post i'd read cereals there once in a while in collier's so that the market was terrific the the highest paying magazines down through argosy blue book adventure and about a dozen different pulp titles dime western being the one and um and i started selling to them right away well not right

24:55.628 --> 25:05.220
I wrote two stories, two westerns that didn't sell, then I decided I better do some research and get into it, and so I did.

25:07.983 --> 25:10.226
And so you say the markets just dried up?

25:10.566 --> 25:15.432
Yeah, and it was because of TV, but I didn't like any of the stuff on TV.

25:15.512 --> 25:16.333
They were all the same.

25:16.614 --> 25:22.581
All these guys were meeting in the street for the fast draw, which in my research,

25:22.814 --> 25:24.156
I never came across.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.838
It never happened, no.

25:27.221 --> 25:33.049
So, and in all the westerns that I wrote, I never had that scene, ever.

25:35.232 --> 25:39.899
Until I started writing the crime and police, then I can use it.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.723
Now I can use that kind of a face-off situation.

25:42.864 --> 25:44.286
It's kind of an echo of that.

25:44.486 --> 25:49.193
Now that I think about it, in this book, when they talk about the gun, they talk about

25:50.455 --> 25:59.264
When Raylan is out there with his thumbs, I guess he's thinking like maybe there'll be a shootout.

25:59.284 --> 26:02.648
I bet you were thinking about some of those old westerns there.

26:02.668 --> 26:03.629
Yeah, yeah.

26:03.669 --> 26:07.753
Then Bobby Dale thinks, hey, I wonder what it would be like to face a guy.

26:07.793 --> 26:08.294
That's right.

26:08.835 --> 26:09.455
That's the scene.

26:09.475 --> 26:11.217
So that it begins to be set up.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.959
But that is kind of an echo, isn't it?

26:12.979 --> 26:13.079
Sure.

26:13.099 --> 26:15.141
You must have been thinking about that.

26:15.261 --> 26:16.783
Yeah, and Raylan's got the hat.

26:17.168 --> 26:20.012
And he's even thinking about growing a mustache.

26:20.132 --> 26:22.815
Is this a nod in your mind?

26:22.835 --> 26:25.659
Is Dutch Leonard making a nod to the old westerns?

26:25.879 --> 26:27.902
In a way, yeah.

26:28.162 --> 26:30.165
Are these character-driven novels?

26:30.185 --> 26:33.329
Oh, I think so, definitely, because I don't start out with a plot.

26:33.409 --> 26:38.475
Just a situation and the characters develop the story, definitely.

26:38.495 --> 26:39.577
So where does this start now?

26:39.597 --> 26:44.703
Does this kind of follow the last one pretty much as a continuum, let's say?

26:44.723 --> 26:46.686
Well, you know, the first chapter...

26:46.936 --> 26:49.700
appeared in New Yorker last summer.

26:50.702 --> 26:53.907
I couldn't understand why they wanted... New Yorker?

26:53.927 --> 26:55.269
Yeah, I couldn't understand.

26:55.289 --> 27:07.948
The New Yorker was after me for a couple of years, and fiction editor would write to me and say, would like to see some of you.

27:08.249 --> 27:10.973
And I'd write back and say, I don't write your stories.

27:11.053 --> 27:13.937
I'd say, I write stories where the beginning, middle, and end to them.

27:14.298 --> 27:15.680
Real stories, stories.

27:15.980 --> 27:18.705
And I haven't written a short story in so long.

27:20.447 --> 27:22.570
Chapter one now?

27:22.590 --> 27:22.831
Yeah.

27:22.931 --> 27:23.892
Do they say it in here?

27:24.213 --> 27:25.535
No.

27:25.575 --> 27:27.878
No, they don't say it.

27:29.040 --> 27:35.910
And my original chapter one, when I started writing that book, is now chapter 10.

27:36.464 --> 27:41.289
I wanted to start out with Raylan and Reverend Don.

27:42.270 --> 27:44.333
But then... Really?

27:44.413 --> 27:44.753
Yeah.

27:44.993 --> 27:46.595
Raylan is looking for Harry.

27:47.256 --> 27:49.999
So originally it started with Raylan looking for Harry.

27:50.179 --> 27:51.360
Yeah.

27:51.801 --> 27:53.222
What is now chapter 10?

27:53.583 --> 27:54.203
Yeah.

27:54.223 --> 27:56.886
Is Raylan going to see Don for the first time?

27:58.168 --> 28:04.935
So then I thought, uh-oh, I'm going to have to...

28:06.350 --> 28:16.820
Once I finished this first chapter with Dawn, now I'm going to have to do a lot of telling why he went to see Dawn.

28:18.482 --> 28:21.625
And I thought, well, I can just do that in another chapter.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.908
But then it got more complicated.

28:24.968 --> 28:25.789
I thought, well, wait a minute.

28:25.809 --> 28:28.892
I'm going to have to introduce these bad guys.

28:29.032 --> 28:30.393
I can't tell about them.

28:30.473 --> 28:32.956
You've got to see them.

28:32.996 --> 28:35.378
You can take that too, please.

28:35.797 --> 29:00.387
you can i don't want to what it amounted to that if i started with that chapter i'd be telling too much i have to i want to show and so that then i i had a few chapters here and then i finally i i added the first chapter just so that i could start with railing and be and because on um

29:01.008 --> 29:09.779
the last book tour, or even previous book tours, since Maximum Bob, people would ask me, whatever happened to Dale Crowe, Jr.?

29:11.121 --> 29:14.926
He took off in that Cadillac, and we haven't seen him since.

29:14.946 --> 29:15.947
I said, I don't know.

29:15.967 --> 29:20.033
I said, he'll probably get picked up.

29:20.053 --> 29:21.374
So I thought, all right, I'll do it.

29:21.394 --> 29:22.876
I didn't make that connection.

29:22.916 --> 29:25.460
So I said, I'll do it for them.

29:26.741 --> 29:28.163
Here's Dale Crowe, Jr.

29:28.750 --> 29:33.136
I didn't make that connection with the last book, but there he was.

29:33.637 --> 29:34.678
Oh, that's terrific.

29:34.698 --> 29:36.961
So they are character-driven stories.

29:37.222 --> 29:41.768
And let's just talk about, again, we were talking about the Westerns and that dried up.

29:42.288 --> 29:44.792
So, I mean, was there any anxiety that you could do this?

29:44.872 --> 29:47.375
I mean... Yes, indeed.

29:47.876 --> 29:54.505
Because when I read, when I wrote 52 Pickup, which was, no...

29:56.155 --> 30:00.400
No, the first one was the Big Bounce, the first non-Western.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.102
But it wasn't urban.

30:02.182 --> 30:04.986
It was up in the Thumb area of Michigan.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.369
Which is in the news lately.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.311
Yeah, yeah.

30:11.053 --> 30:20.384
It was the next one, 52 Pickup, where I got a scene where this character's going to cross Woodward Avenue, up near Six Mile and Highland Park.

30:21.145 --> 30:25.150
And I thought, jeez, there are hundreds of thousands of people.

30:25.332 --> 30:28.516
who have walked across Woodland Avenue right here.

30:28.556 --> 30:29.878
How do I do it?

30:31.059 --> 30:42.213
I didn't feel that confident about describing the appearance, the mood.

30:44.356 --> 30:45.537
I didn't know how to do it.

30:46.238 --> 30:51.525
But this is when I was developing the idea of always writing from a point of view.

30:52.012 --> 31:17.715
always from a character's point of view so that you carry his sound and and you carry his attitude so it's how he sees whatever it is i don't know if you've ever written in the first person has it one book hombre but not from the character's point from a minor character's point of view who's along for the ride so really only tried it that once yeah and

31:17.898 --> 31:21.604
No, and I thought, oh, I don't want to be stuck with one point of view.

31:22.345 --> 31:23.547
That'd be no fun.

31:23.567 --> 31:29.255
That's why I've never had a continuing character, at least first-person continuing character.

31:29.275 --> 31:30.537
That's very interesting.

31:30.557 --> 31:41.274
And if you were to characterize an Elmore Leonard hero, if I were to characterize, there would be a guy that's got a few warts.

31:41.294 --> 31:43.718
I mean, I've always the cleanest of the dirty.

31:43.738 --> 31:45.340
In the old days, when he was

31:45.775 --> 31:54.571
you're all out of socks and you're trying to find which one is the cleanest one when you're living alone, you know what I'm saying?

31:54.591 --> 32:05.190
You remember a kid living alone and, you know, whatever I got, I haven't done my, that's not maybe a very good metaphor, but your guys, your heroes are not squeaky clean guys.

32:05.230 --> 32:06.292
No, no.

32:07.114 --> 32:09.538
I mean, they are, they would be known to

32:09.991 --> 32:37.433
maybe prevaricate a little bit up the up the uh the street yeah and the cops will cut corners as they do you know it's funny because uh the the book freaky deaky was optioned and uh screenplay was written well before it was written the screenwriter i forgot his name came to see me and he said i want to know more about this uh this detective chris mankowski i want to know more about i said well

32:37.784 --> 32:41.307
I said, everything you want to know about him is in the first chapter.

32:41.327 --> 32:47.573
When these two guys, the two bomb squad guys, go out in the backyard and this guy's sitting on a chair that's rigged with dynamite.

32:48.134 --> 32:51.177
And they tell him, don't get out from the chair.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.518
We know you're fast.

32:52.678 --> 33:02.208
We know you had a reputation when you were with the pony down guys who were dealing crack and heroin on the street.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.770
And you see a cop car up.

33:04.919 --> 33:07.782
You're gone, you know, but don't get out of that chair.

33:08.863 --> 33:14.169
And then they go out in the backyard and they start talking about something else, and boom, the room blows up, you know.

33:14.810 --> 33:17.313
And they keep continuing on talking.

33:17.333 --> 33:20.276
They don't even... And I said, that's the guy.

33:20.997 --> 33:22.758
He said, I can't write a scene like that.

33:22.798 --> 33:25.141
The hero, he lets a person die?

33:26.422 --> 33:27.444
I said, that's the guy.

33:27.464 --> 33:33.390
I said, every cop I ever met would do the same thing.

33:33.590 --> 34:03.445
you know do you still do much field work per se sure right around well not not looking like that no it's always specific because i have a researcher who does the hard work the the uh looking up in the in the files and all that and and on and uh find me a bail bondsman for example he'll talk to a half a dozen in in palm beach county before he comes up with the guy and then he finds out about the guy's business

34:04.083 --> 34:06.726
And then I meet him and talk to him, spend a day with him.

34:07.227 --> 34:11.753
Then I can call up the bail bondsman and ask him specific questions.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.816
Accuracy obviously is very important to you.

34:14.836 --> 34:16.358
Yeah, yeah, very important.

34:16.398 --> 34:17.780
To get it down, right.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.904
Do you hear from any readers that people write to you?

34:20.924 --> 34:21.324
Oh, yeah, a lot.

34:21.645 --> 34:21.985
A lot.

34:22.085 --> 34:23.988
I mean, they say you got it right on.

34:24.348 --> 34:26.871
Yeah.

34:27.092 --> 34:29.735
I hear from, and I hear from critics.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.820
I mean, people criticizing, criticizing my grammar.

34:34.357 --> 34:41.945
And I tell them that if proper usage gets in the way, then it might have to go, that's all.

34:42.226 --> 34:49.554
I don't want to interfere with the sound of the prose.

34:51.076 --> 34:54.620
I don't want the reader ever to be aware of me.

34:56.081 --> 34:58.284
Do you have an idea where these stories are going?

34:58.664 --> 35:02.068
Or are they mentioned now in the last book?

35:02.487 --> 35:05.310
That thing changed in mid-spring, clearly.

35:06.211 --> 35:06.912
Yeah.

35:07.032 --> 35:13.861
Harry was the main event, and all of a sudden you didn't like so much the way this guy was developing.

35:14.141 --> 35:14.922
Yeah.

35:15.323 --> 35:18.366
Has that pretty much happened routinely in your books?

35:18.386 --> 35:25.074
It happens more with bringing characters in who I hadn't counted on being important.

35:25.094 --> 35:31.482
But a character all of a sudden shows himself to be pretty interesting in the way he talks,

35:31.748 --> 35:35.133
and he kind of pushes his way into the center of the plot.

35:36.234 --> 35:47.451
A good example would be in Bandits, there was a Mosquito Indian from Nicaragua who didn't even have a name the first scene he's in.

35:47.931 --> 35:56.884
And then I got to like the guy, and pretty soon he's, I think he was the only one in the book who shoots anybody.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.767
Do you entertain yourself in the writing?

35:58.787 --> 35:58.887
Yeah.

35:59.542 --> 36:06.532
Yeah, that's... And the nice part about it is I'm the only one I have to please.

36:06.592 --> 36:09.736
That's what's so nice about writing novels.

36:11.379 --> 36:15.324
You know, well, by now I know my editor or I know the publisher's going to like it.

36:15.364 --> 36:16.025
I know that.

36:17.527 --> 36:21.393
But right from the beginning, this is the way I want to write.

36:21.433 --> 36:23.556
And these are the kind of characters I want to develop.

36:23.976 --> 36:28.182
So with the first one, The Big Bounce, it was rejected...

36:28.887 --> 36:37.075
This was after my agent in Hollywood, Swanee, said, kiddo, I'm going to make you rich in 1966.

36:37.295 --> 36:39.597
It was rejected 84 times.

36:39.637 --> 36:40.738
How many?

36:40.798 --> 36:41.078
84.

36:41.499 --> 36:45.282
Most of them in Hollywood, maybe a dozen times in New York.

36:47.084 --> 36:48.445
I'm going to make you rich.

36:48.465 --> 36:50.868
So I felt great.

36:51.308 --> 36:55.452
That's the most encouraging thing anyone's ever said to me.

36:55.853 --> 37:01.338
Because I do, I did enter this with a commercial bent.

37:01.758 --> 37:03.280
I want to make money doing this.

37:03.380 --> 37:07.564
And I'm glad that I thank God that I'm a prose writer, not a poet.

37:07.884 --> 37:10.546
You know, Jesus, what if I was just trying to sound?

37:15.791 --> 37:20.976
So I have an opportunity to make a lot of money and have fun and please myself.

37:21.356 --> 37:22.297
What's wrong with that?

37:22.317 --> 37:23.498
Right, right.

37:24.068 --> 37:26.551
But now screenwriting, that's something else.

37:26.571 --> 37:27.252
Have you tried that?

37:27.412 --> 37:28.993
Oh, I've done it a dozen times.

37:29.013 --> 37:30.936
I've written a dozen movies or so.

37:30.956 --> 37:32.057
From your own books?

37:32.077 --> 37:37.663
Yeah, and one from somebody else's, The Rosary Murders.

37:37.723 --> 37:38.644
That was another.

37:38.664 --> 37:43.650
And Joe Kidd, the Eastwood movie, was an original.

37:44.130 --> 37:48.475
Mr. Majestic with Bronson, that was an original screenplay.

37:48.495 --> 37:50.397
But then I...

37:50.663 --> 37:51.965
novelized it.

37:52.046 --> 37:54.651
Oh, you mean the movie came first before I read the novel?

37:54.691 --> 37:56.975
I never saw the film.

37:57.616 --> 37:58.778
Yeah, yeah.

37:58.879 --> 38:00.221
It's two different sets of skills.

38:00.261 --> 38:00.702
Oh, yeah.

38:01.183 --> 38:07.695
And I remember Swanee, my agent, then saying, well, now you're going to do this as a book.

38:07.715 --> 38:11.743
He said, you're going to have to put a lot of description in there.

38:12.348 --> 38:13.649
to fill it out.

38:13.870 --> 38:15.972
I said, no, you don't write that way.

38:16.012 --> 38:17.334
You write this way.

38:18.094 --> 38:19.116
Dialogue.

38:19.796 --> 38:21.598
You were just being what when you meant this way?

38:21.618 --> 38:23.240
You're going horizontally, right?

38:23.300 --> 38:23.701
Yeah.

38:23.721 --> 38:25.883
And then you said, no, you went this way vertically.

38:25.903 --> 38:26.764
Yeah, right.

38:27.084 --> 38:38.377
And, you know, just put a lot of dialogue in, short exchanges that will get you more pages.

38:38.797 --> 38:40.279
Not descriptions.

38:40.883 --> 38:43.206
Do you have any favorites among your folks, personal favorites?

38:43.226 --> 38:44.668
I like Freaky Deaky.

38:44.688 --> 38:46.250
I like La Brava.

38:47.391 --> 38:50.174
I like Kill Shot a lot.

38:51.656 --> 38:54.400
And Quentin Tarantino is going to do that one.

38:54.420 --> 38:55.861
He's got four of mine now.

38:56.282 --> 38:56.722
He's got what?

38:56.903 --> 38:57.764
Four of them.

38:57.924 --> 38:59.886
Miramax optioned four.

39:00.707 --> 39:06.074
Because when he, right after Reservoir Dogs, he wanted to do Rum Punch.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.338
But he wasn't in a position to make a deal.

39:10.027 --> 39:19.116
Because three years ago, that was about three years ago, when he was a teenager, he had stolen a book of mine.

39:19.136 --> 39:21.859
He told this to my current agent, Michael Siegel.

39:22.179 --> 39:26.924
He stole a book of mine, got caught, and his family, his mom and dad, grounded it.

39:26.944 --> 39:28.666
He couldn't leave the house for a while or something.

39:28.706 --> 39:29.046
He was a kid.

39:29.267 --> 39:29.947
He was a kid.

39:30.548 --> 39:34.172
And when he got out, he bought the book.

39:34.552 --> 39:37.435
And then Rum Punch comes out right after...

39:37.752 --> 39:47.961
while he's in Hollywood with Reservoir Dogs, and he sees three of the characters from that book, The Switch, and he wanted to buy it.

39:48.241 --> 39:53.806
But he wasn't set up to do that, and he had so many other things to do in the meantime.

39:54.427 --> 40:05.937
So then, just about six months ago or so, Michael Siegel took five titles to him, and he read them, and he chose four of them.

40:06.288 --> 40:06.949
Wow.

40:07.089 --> 40:08.831
And Miramax optioned them.

40:08.852 --> 40:11.435
Is it one deal or four separate deals?

40:11.816 --> 40:25.675
It's, well, yeah, it's one deal, but then, of course, the payoff is as they... So did you see, this is not from my story, but did you see this thing with Forrest Gump, Winston Groom, telling him that the movie didn't make any money?

40:25.695 --> 40:26.476
Oh, I believe that.

40:26.776 --> 40:28.358
I believe that, sure.

40:28.378 --> 40:29.860
I mean, I believe they told him that.

40:30.181 --> 40:33.325
Yeah, and he was supposed to get 3% of the gross or whatever.

40:33.608 --> 40:36.316
of the net or whatever, and they said, well, there's no profit.

40:36.336 --> 40:36.657
Yeah.

40:36.677 --> 40:39.145
And the Kings made about $400 million.

40:39.165 --> 40:40.388
I know, I know.

40:40.409 --> 40:42.936
I mean, they've all, it's in today's New York Times.

40:43.638 --> 40:46.968
Well, for the longest time, who wrote The Godfather?

40:47.309 --> 40:48.192
Mario Puzo.

40:48.577 --> 41:13.167
didn't see any money from the godfather that had made i don't know how many hundreds of millions probably with accounting is the biggest oh yeah to get your money up front oh yeah that's my percentages that's what swanee's always said he said get as much as you can up front and then forget about it he said the only writer and he represented john o'hara he's the only guy who ever made any money on uh yeah and that was on butterfield eight

41:13.552 --> 41:14.533
No kidding.

41:14.614 --> 41:17.538
I don't know how he worked there.

41:17.958 --> 41:27.452
I got a check once for $25,000 after Mr. Majestic had been out, I don't know, a few months or so.

41:28.033 --> 41:29.235
I got a check for $25,000.

41:29.575 --> 41:33.140
And I called Swanee and I said, what's this for?

41:33.241 --> 41:35.764
He said, the picture's broken even.

41:36.025 --> 41:37.146
That was in the contract.

41:37.166 --> 41:41.112
You get a $25,000 bonus if they start to make money.

41:41.564 --> 41:47.633
And this was because Walter Barish was the producer, and he's an honorable, honest man.

41:48.214 --> 41:51.559
But for the most part, this would never happen.

41:51.599 --> 41:53.622
No, that's right.

41:53.782 --> 41:54.403
That's great.

41:54.423 --> 42:03.817
If you read the Times, the New York Times, this story about Gump is in today's New York Times, but Winston Groom is saying, well, the movie didn't make any money.

42:04.658 --> 42:08.264
I mean, this is one of the biggest movies of the last ten years.

42:08.284 --> 42:08.584
Yeah.

42:09.104 --> 42:10.887
Oscar-winning movie and all this.

42:10.947 --> 42:11.708
Sure.

42:11.728 --> 42:13.731
We had to spend so much with publicity.

42:13.771 --> 42:14.472
Yeah.

42:15.273 --> 42:18.037
All these numbers are flying around, and when you look at it, it's minus.

42:18.077 --> 42:18.938
This thing's in the red.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.904
Well, a big percentage of it goes just to studio overhead.

42:23.265 --> 42:25.528
You know, like 15% or whatever.

42:25.849 --> 42:29.233
It goes for the pictures that didn't make any money.

42:29.254 --> 42:29.514
That's right.

42:29.534 --> 42:29.674
Yeah.

42:30.656 --> 42:31.837
Listen, I think we have plenty of stuff.

42:31.857 --> 42:33.780
Could you sign a couple of these books for me?

42:33.800 --> 42:33.900
Yeah.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.584
One for me, one for my good buddy, who's a great fan.

42:36.604 --> 42:37.105
Okay, go ahead.

42:37.125 --> 42:37.385
I'm sorry.

42:37.405 --> 42:38.487
Then we can get downstairs.

42:39.040 --> 42:47.171
You know, it was interesting that the hook then for journalists was that I was an overnight success after 30 years.

42:48.192 --> 42:58.566
And I think most journalists then thought I was, had been just slaving away and finally this is the breakthrough bit.

42:58.826 --> 43:02.331
But I was always making money, you know, because I was always selling to Hollywood.

43:03.020 --> 43:05.442
But I love this whole concept of overnight success, too.

43:05.602 --> 43:06.003
Yeah, yeah.

43:06.023 --> 43:07.244
Like he hadn't done anything before.

43:07.464 --> 43:15.892
Yeah, the one guy asked me, a guy from CBC in Toronto, he said, what's it like, success coming at your age?

43:16.793 --> 43:25.761
And it wasn't so much that the age, it was that his assumption that I hadn't been successful before.

43:26.161 --> 43:29.884
But I'd sold everything I wrote, what do you have to do, you know?

43:29.904 --> 43:31.626
Look, he has to have known that you...

43:32.348 --> 43:33.351
I'm expecting this.

43:33.658 --> 43:34.292
My first book.
