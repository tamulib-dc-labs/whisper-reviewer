WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:19.491
Thank you.

00:25.529 --> 00:43.370
I would like to thank the Library of Congress and its directors for putting this evening and proposing together.

00:44.131 --> 00:53.022
It is so exciting to me to meet for the first time some people with whom I have been corresponding for many years.

00:53.407 --> 00:59.159
and to see some old friends who have some great distances.

00:59.179 --> 01:12.546
And I thank all of you from the body to my heart for being here this evening and making it so very special for me and for everyone in the community.

01:17.858 --> 01:26.995
I heard earlier, if I didn't say this very correctly, the book in the Library of Congress is a unique organization.

01:27.135 --> 01:28.939
It's a partnership with the Library.

01:29.580 --> 01:33.387
The Library of Congress pays for the four staff salaries that

01:33.367 --> 01:55.710
By law, we depend on contributions from the private sector for all of our projects and all of our programs, and this would not have been possible tonight without help from Henry Holden Company, which made a contribution to the Senate for the Book, which is helping to pay for the symposium and the dinner.

01:56.110 --> 02:00.555
And we're really very pleased about this and pleased that tonight,

02:00.822 --> 02:02.244
Muriel Kaplan.

02:02.264 --> 02:06.129
Muriel is the general counsel for Henry Colt that's here.

02:06.249 --> 02:27.538
And furthermore, I should say that Muriel is the one who, as the person most closely involved with the Henry Colt archives, I know from talking to Carol and to Alex McLeod and I think to some of the others, has been immensely helpful for historical research and to our people who've worked on this.

02:27.518 --> 02:37.984
the River series, and I'm very pleased to not only acknowledge Henry Holt's help, but to ask Muriel to come up for a few words.

02:50.857 --> 02:51.938
Good evening.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.180
I'm delighted to be here.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.543
I want to thank John Cullin for the book.

02:56.084 --> 03:02.413
I want to thank Carol Fitzgerald who's got me more involved in aspects of Rivers of America series.

03:03.094 --> 03:09.102
On behalf of Michael Nellman, who has been at Henry Paulson Company and Henry Paulson, we thank everyone for being here.

03:09.082 --> 03:11.085
This is a particular honor for me.

03:11.105 --> 03:15.212
I do work on issues relating to rights.

03:15.853 --> 03:20.500
To see to come alive like this is a special treat for me.

03:20.520 --> 03:28.753
And in my work, every day I usually feel that present items or works that are going to be published in the year 2000 or 2001.

03:28.793 --> 03:33.700
So it's particularly nice to be able to delve past into history through this program.

03:34.001 --> 03:34.802
Thank you.

03:41.684 --> 03:45.872
Thank you, Muriel, and thank you to Henry Holden's company.

03:45.892 --> 03:57.854
And if you want to read about the complicated publishing history of this series, there's a note in the program that we prepare.

03:57.894 --> 03:59.777
Thank you very much.

03:59.757 --> 04:07.276
I mentioned earlier that we're developing plans to the Center for the Emergency, New Rivers of America project.

04:07.356 --> 04:15.758
We're not sure exactly how that's going to develop and what precisely that means, but we do know that it's going to help combine

04:15.738 --> 04:23.997
literary, historical, and environmental issues focused on the rivers of America.

04:24.338 --> 04:32.818
And I'm very pleased tonight to have representatives in two of the rivers, heritage, environmental groups

04:32.798 --> 04:35.862
that we look forward to cooperating with.

04:36.103 --> 04:44.976
In fact, we started cooperating on a project with one of them, and I'd like to call on these two folks to say just a word or two.

04:44.996 --> 04:49.963
The first is Pam Michaels, and Pam represents International Rivers Network,

04:49.943 --> 05:05.653
involved in a poetry project already about the rivers of America called the River of Words and the Center for the Book is pleased now to become involved with this project and to be hosting the winners of his children's poetry project at L.C.

05:06.274 --> 05:11.023
and I leave you in case you say.

05:14.311 --> 05:18.458
I want to thank you too for bringing together this amazing room full of people.

05:18.478 --> 05:21.844
I'm just the one who works on the British Union room.

05:22.064 --> 05:26.592
People are so, there's so much wisdom, visual wisdom in this room right now.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.618
It's really an honor.

05:29.638 --> 05:35.087
River of Words is an environmental poetry and art context for American children.

05:36.097 --> 05:46.252
We invite children to form their natural landscape to interpret what they've learned in words and images.

05:47.153 --> 06:04.939
It's two years old and thanks to John, we have eight national winners every year who come to the Library of Congress and are honored in this room with their teachers and read their poetry and play their hard work.

06:05.662 --> 06:14.800
We at International Rivers Network believe that in order to restore rivers, you have to re-story them in a way.

06:14.820 --> 06:22.135
And the work that's been coming into our office over the past two years of watershed-specific

06:22.891 --> 06:31.220
words and images from the children of America really constitutes a view of America's nature, the eyes of its children.

06:31.240 --> 06:38.128
And while some of it is quite horrifying, I have to tell you, a lot of kids believe that we're killing the earth.

06:38.708 --> 06:41.572
That's the tone of a lot of the culture we see.

06:41.592 --> 06:42.633
There's also a lot of hope.

06:43.353 --> 06:49.320
And we think that getting kids out into their communities, exploring their local creeks and rivers and watersheds,

06:49.638 --> 07:00.873
help them have a sense of belonging and place and ultimately will make them better stewards and hopefully will protect the ones in the river.

07:00.893 --> 07:15.493
So I thank Senator the Book for partnering up with us and we invite you to come on May 3rd for our awards ceremony for the 97 national winners here in the library.

07:20.063 --> 07:38.697
Rebecca Water is the president of American Rivers and I know several of you have met Rebecca tonight and I'd like to call on her to say a few words about Rivers and River Heritage and whatever else she would like to say.

07:41.309 --> 07:42.431
Thank you, John.

07:42.451 --> 07:45.034
I appreciate also the opportunity to be here.

07:45.054 --> 07:49.941
I'd like to first recognize two important people who are with me here tonight.

07:50.441 --> 07:56.590
One of my board members, Anne Christendon.

07:57.371 --> 08:01.216
She's a writer herself and one of our inspiring forces.

08:01.236 --> 08:05.682
And also, Tom Cassidy, our general counsel, is here with me tonight.

08:05.782 --> 08:08.886
I want to introduce those people to you.

08:13.422 --> 08:20.249
By camera, I can feel the passion for river flowing through this room, and it is an inspiration.

08:20.830 --> 08:25.595
I had a chance to talk with Margaret Sandburn and Wilma Dykeman.

08:26.556 --> 08:39.750
These women have immortalized rivers, and they have also fought for their health and their well-being, and I salute you and I thank you for the leadership you have provided to this river conservation movement.

08:40.152 --> 08:47.540
I am very, very pleased with the recent elevation of rivers on the national agenda.

08:47.900 --> 09:01.914
I don't know how many of you happened to catch in the State of the Union address President Clinton announcing the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, but it is something which American Rivers is very, very excited about.

09:01.974 --> 09:09.282
We see it as probably the best thing that has happened to Rivers in 25 years, and we think it's

09:09.262 --> 09:17.713
It's a wonderful thing to encourage people all across the country to continue their good efforts to restore and protect our nation's rivers.

09:19.295 --> 09:21.879
The initiative has two main components.

09:21.899 --> 09:31.912
One is to select, in the first year, ten rivers across the nation that will stand up as American heritage rivers.

09:32.052 --> 09:36.298
And I have no doubt that many of those ten

09:36.278 --> 09:52.775
will be among the ones that were immortalized in the Rivers Heritage Series and I have no doubt that the authors and the illustrators and the other people who are here tonight will work very hard to see that their rivers are among those ten.

09:52.795 --> 09:55.257
I encourage you to do that strongly.

09:55.697 --> 10:01.223
The other part of the initiative is to create a toolbox that will be available for all rivers

10:01.203 --> 10:05.553
all three and a half million dollars of rivers and streams in the country.

10:05.913 --> 10:16.697
And that toolbox will make it easier for the community to get down to the business of restoring this great heritage.

10:17.605 --> 10:26.478
By restoring our rivers, we restore our heritage, we restore and salute our literature, we restore our environment.

10:27.339 --> 10:37.774
I am reminded of the words of one of our other board members, Charles Corral, who says that America is a great story and there's a river on every page.

10:38.733 --> 10:49.992
So we very much look forward to working with the book and taking that story out to the people of America and thank you for the opportunity to be here tonight.

10:56.080 --> 11:08.138
I guess one of our sub-themes is Women and Rivers because, as you all know, the Rivers of America book series was really planned and started by Constance and Skinner.

11:08.298 --> 11:13.566
And I have a very brief acknowledgment of her role in the program.

11:13.546 --> 11:37.647
And I did learn, in learning about the series, more about Constance Lindsay Skinner, and I thought it was appropriate that tonight we pay a brief tribute to her, and I have asked Martha Hopkins, who is a Library of Congress person working in our exhibits, Interpretive Programs Officer,

11:37.627 --> 11:57.610
office with whom we had worked before and also was involved with the Women's National Book Association, which has a special relationship with Constance Lindsay Skinner to come forward and help us with that part of the program, Margaret.

11:59.345 --> 12:00.407
Thank you, Joan.

12:01.248 --> 12:14.552
As Vice President of the Washington Chapter of the Women's National Book Association, I want to speak about Constance Lindsay Skinner's contributions to that organization and about the award which we give in her honor.

12:14.532 --> 12:26.006
Let me first take you back to the days when WNBA was formed, a time when women were not welcome in the publishing associations of the New York publishing industry.

12:26.566 --> 12:38.160
So, in 1917, a group of female booksellers put out a call for women to join them in forming their own organization, the Women's National Book Association.

12:38.140 --> 12:48.232
This organization of writers, editors, publishers, librarians, and other book lovers have expanded over the years to include chapters in many U.S.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.542
cities as well as in New York and Washington.

12:51.657 --> 13:03.417
We don't know if Constance Lindsay Skinner was among the women who came to the observational meetings in 1917, but we do know that she was living in New York at that time.

13:03.437 --> 13:12.332
She had come there in 1915 to write and also to serve as a literary critic for the New York Journal Tribune.

13:12.751 --> 13:22.550
Skinner's love of books must have led her to investigate the newly formed WNBA, and we do know that by 1926 she was deeply involved.

13:23.151 --> 13:32.228
Realizing the need for a publication for that organization, she helped found the Book Woman, which is still our national newsletter.

13:32.208 --> 13:46.497
During her long association with the New York chapter of WNBA, Constance Lindsley Skinder's career stretched across several book-related fields—journalist, poet, author, literary critic, and editor.

13:47.258 --> 13:51.988
She wrote numerous children's books, many of them a genuine story before.

13:52.053 --> 13:56.685
She also wrote poetry about the Indians of her native British Columbia.

13:57.367 --> 14:05.809
Her most ambitious project during the last decade of her life was the Rivers of America series, which we are celebrating tonight.

14:06.177 --> 14:12.331
Constance Lindsay Skinner was a vivacious and colorful woman who never lost her sense of adventure.

14:12.932 --> 14:23.376
Her protege, Helen Colquois, remembers how she struck all Indian people, and I think they may have been first put off by her drive, appearance, and presence.

14:23.356 --> 14:29.208
They very quickly were put at you by her charming nature and wonderful writhe sense of humor.

14:29.609 --> 14:36.403
But she could also poach her highly lawed authority with her sweetly cross-stitch life as wicked as opinion.

14:36.856 --> 14:40.982
Skinner's talents were highly valued by her WMBA colleagues.

14:41.543 --> 14:55.725
When she suddenly died in 1939, it was suggested that an award be given in her honor to an outstanding American book woman who had made an exceptional contribution to books and read books to society.

14:55.773 --> 15:06.787
Since 1940, the award has been presented to a number of outstanding women who have been effective at the national and international level in bringing books and people together.

15:06.847 --> 15:16.600
Recipients have included Pearl Buck, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rachel Carson, Barbara Bush, and most recently, Carolyn Hollywood.

15:16.934 --> 15:24.901
I might add that, in addition to being named for Skinner, the award has had other associations with the Rivers of America series.

15:25.542 --> 15:37.573
The first award was presented in 1940 to Ann Carol Moore, a prominent New York children's librarian, by one of Skinner's Rivers of America series authors, Carl Harmon.

15:38.093 --> 15:43.078
In fact, Skinner was actually correcting Galilee when Carmen's book the night that she died.

15:43.258 --> 15:46.941
She was actually found with Ken and Ma'am correcting Galilee.

15:46.921 --> 15:54.811
In 1941, the award went to Blair Niles, who wrote the book about the James River series.

15:54.831 --> 16:12.473
Among WNBA members, Skinner is still remembered and honored of an active member, former vice president of the New York chapter, a founder of the Book Woman, and one of the first women to hold a major editorial position in an American publishing company.

16:12.593 --> 16:12.793
Thank you.

16:19.152 --> 16:24.077
Here's a quote from Constance Lindy Skinner that I love.

16:24.718 --> 16:30.924
The natural rhythm of moving the pioneer life of America forward was the rhythm of flowing water, she wrote.

16:31.725 --> 16:45.919
Because Rivers had a powerful influence on the temperament and the imagination of mankind, end quote, she determined that the books in the Rivers of America series first would be literary and then historical.

16:45.899 --> 16:51.064
But the key was the authors would be from the regions of the rivers they wrote about.

16:51.565 --> 16:57.792
The illustrators would be well-known regional artists also familiar with the river being described.

16:58.853 --> 17:10.405
The 65 books in the series were published between 1937 and 1974 by Carra and Reinhart and its corporate successors, Reinhart and Company, and Holt, Reinhart and Winston.

17:10.570 --> 17:21.070
Constance Flynn and Skinner served as general editor of the series until their unexpected death, pen-in-hand, editing one of the books in 1939.

17:21.202 --> 17:42.400
The series editors who succeeded her were Stephen Vincent Binet and Carl Carman, 1940 to 1944, Herbie Allen, 1944 to 1946, Herbie Allen and Carl Carman, 46 to 51, and Carl Carman, 1952 to 1974.

17:42.380 --> 17:57.543
You can see that there's a complicated history here, but it's a history that I moved and heard Constance Timothy Skinner's own words, America forward to the stories of the rivers and the stories of the river folk.

17:57.563 --> 18:09.180
And I think in paying tribute to Constance Timothy Skinner, we also have to think of the other folks who were the editors and whose imagination carried the series forward.

18:09.160 --> 18:24.300
Not the least for the authors and illustrators who are here tonight and those who are represented by their families and others whose remembrance has been involved, I think, through our conversations.

18:24.483 --> 18:33.655
To symbolize this, I've asked just two of our authors to say a brief word tonight, and let me tell you how I chose them.

18:33.675 --> 18:51.958
It wasn't very difficult, because if you take the list in your program of the books chronologically, you will see that the author here tonight, who represents the earliest published in the book, is Dr. Thomas Clark, whose book, The Kentucky, was published in 1942.

18:51.938 --> 19:02.131
And we also are honored to have the author of the most recent book in this series, Margaret Sanborn, author of America, which was published in 1920.

19:02.672 --> 19:15.910
And I would like first to call on Dr. Clark and then Margaret for just a few thoughts that they might have on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Rivers of America book series.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.553
Thank you.

19:25.975 --> 19:50.664
I didn't remember, I was back in the 1940s, when I first read Larry Niles' book, and the earlier ones, and then read that description across from Linda's county.

19:50.684 --> 19:55.510
She declared war against all historians.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.654
I don't think she had any faith in my trade.

20:00.017 --> 20:08.510
I'm riding down the Palisades with Constance Roark, that wonderful author and human being.

20:09.712 --> 20:12.757
And I told her, I would like to do Margaret Ritter's books.

20:14.419 --> 20:16.603
And she said, I'll arrange that for you.

20:17.785 --> 20:19.928
She wrote to John Farrer.

20:20.650 --> 20:33.507
and they were viewed during my grand major frontier, and a guy with a team from Steven Vincent Bernay had a contract in the same manner.

20:33.527 --> 20:42.719
Later on, I was to develop their own friendship with John Farrah, and I almost don't dare tell you this story.

20:43.881 --> 20:47.265
John went across Madison Avenue,

20:48.140 --> 20:51.624
And this conversation took place.

20:53.146 --> 21:09.904
John had just been to a funeral, and he said it was the most delightful funeral I've ever attended.

21:09.924 --> 21:11.346
And it was the funeral of Constance Bender Skinner.

21:12.001 --> 21:24.412
For me, I agree with Ms.

21:24.692 --> 21:30.597
Skinner's essay and her major thesis.

21:30.617 --> 21:36.762
The river races through American life like a common thread, really.

21:38.724 --> 21:41.046
It's an important strand

21:41.617 --> 21:45.601
It's a strand on which civilization itself is strong.

21:49.065 --> 22:00.818
And walking up the Dino River, talking to people who never get into these pages of credit books.

22:00.838 --> 22:11.370
People who live life at the ground level, who live it in an exciting way, have helped to blaze the way across this continent.

22:11.806 --> 22:23.780
to develop its institutions, and richest of all, is a wonderful store of folklore and folk life.

22:26.383 --> 22:35.113
Only I wish that I could go back to 1938, 39, and once again

22:35.465 --> 22:38.409
throughout the banks of the Kentucky.

22:38.929 --> 23:00.656
I would like to talk to the old log man who ran down the river, going through all the bends and the sucks, being exposed to all the dangers, threats, banks, rock floors.

23:00.676 --> 23:02.839
I'd like to run them frankly.

23:03.140 --> 23:10.516
and just once shut off my complete, shut off completely, my Methodist coffee.

23:11.278 --> 23:20.237
And for one Saturday night, in one of the finest poor houses,

23:24.166 --> 23:44.178
I love this guy.

23:44.198 --> 23:44.739
I don't want to be adopted.

23:44.759 --> 23:45.420
We've got to get him on the show.

23:45.440 --> 23:45.661
It's great.

23:45.681 --> 23:46.342
We've got to get him on the show.

23:46.362 --> 23:46.923
I'm going to change my name.

23:46.943 --> 23:47.203
I understand.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.112
I have a very nice wife sitting here.

23:50.293 --> 24:01.024
I interviewed the boys in Cape Town and the girls who ran the game.

24:04.295 --> 24:20.786
I'd like now to turn to Margaret Sanborn.

24:21.086 --> 24:26.877
Margaret and I have had a number of telephone conversations in the last

24:26.857 --> 24:35.267
month about this wonderful trip that she and Kathy were able to take across the country.

24:35.287 --> 24:48.142
One of the things that she said to me tonight, and I don't think there's some part of the bargain at all, but the train trip from Mill Valley, a good part of it, went along the American River, which Margaret wrote about.

24:48.643 --> 24:54.450
And I think this was both an unexpected trip, maybe not unexpected to you, but my geography is

24:54.430 --> 24:59.616
slowly improving as I learned more about rivers, and I didn't realize that was the case.

24:59.696 --> 25:16.115
And I think it was a wonderful beginning for your trip, and Margaret in particular, I learned, has been already involved in, as Rebecca mentioned, some of the environmental improvements related to the American River.

25:16.236 --> 25:24.285
I would like to now call on Margaret Sandborn for her comments on the Rivers of America series and anything else she'd like to say.

25:24.265 --> 25:25.788
Thank you.

25:34.947 --> 25:37.791
so I don't think I would follow Dr. Clark.

25:40.294 --> 25:58.660
But when John and I were talking about, he had mentioned to me as we were standing there about the importance of ecology coming for the news here, that the rivers of America.

25:58.640 --> 26:17.070
And so I would have been telling him that this I had not realized until just about two years ago that the American has been long involved as a river that is pointed out by

26:17.050 --> 26:32.076
as the one most engaged because we were about to have a band by an unnecessary and enormous band in Auburn, California.

26:32.096 --> 26:39.328
And so I have been updating my American River book because it's going to be publicly published.

26:39.308 --> 26:43.554
And there were certain things here that, of course, had to be changed.

26:44.295 --> 26:55.191
And I was in correspondence and conversation with Charlie Casey, the Friends of the River in Sacramento, California.

26:55.231 --> 27:01.941
And so he had given me some information by mail, chronology of the...

27:01.921 --> 27:14.635
attempt from them, the river, every time defeated, but always coming back again and again, year after year, a very political sort of thing.

27:14.655 --> 27:18.225
And so he made a little post script and he said,

27:18.205 --> 27:25.578
You have a fan that I would like you to make contrast if you want to.

27:25.598 --> 27:41.665
I don't know if she would be very, very happy because she uses your book and she has been using that book for a number of years with propaganda about the American River and against the band.

27:41.645 --> 27:50.158
So I wrote to her and it has become a very, very close friendship.

27:51.060 --> 28:00.615
And it seems that she gives slideshows and lectures on the rivers of California, but mainly on America.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.922
And she quotes from the book.

28:03.943 --> 28:13.083
And she, in her final words, she makes the final chapter, which is a very short one, the quotation from Leonardo.

28:13.484 --> 28:17.052
And she reads that to the audience, because you haven't seen her.

28:17.032 --> 28:23.563
So I decided I must go and hear this and see how she works with it.

28:23.583 --> 28:28.191
It was very interesting.

28:28.211 --> 28:37.507
The audience responded and she had lots of enthusiasm and of course it wasn't just for my book, but her own thing too.

28:37.527 --> 28:38.128
She took two pictures.

28:38.328 --> 28:57.518
So I thought that it was an interesting thing that this could be applied to all of us if we think they are in danger and the books could be of great importance as some people turn to and describe the people.

28:57.599 --> 29:17.464
We read them, we learn what beautiful rivers we have, and certainly this is going to change our skin, because people are the solution to everything, and you see, well now, if it's gone, do we really want to?

29:18.254 --> 29:34.742
And the American is one of the very finest rivers from the standpoint of river running and sports.

29:36.285 --> 29:43.317
And also, we just want to get complicated because it has just three rivers, and it rises in the Sierra, and it's like,

29:43.297 --> 29:52.115
wild, and we want to try to keep in that way.

29:52.515 --> 29:56.904
And I think the people, more people know about this, about rural communities.

29:56.924 --> 30:00.211
I think it's a lot of progress and makes a lot of sense to republish.

30:00.231 --> 30:04.900
So, thank you, John, for asking me.

30:09.031 --> 30:37.030
I think I might have mentioned earlier tonight to you or to others at least, and that was, we heard earlier when Rebecca mentioned that Wilma Eichmann has been involved in this, and Wilma told me the story about the chapter that she has in her book called The French Broad, and I hope I'm not telling you that accurately, Wilma, but I know I got the general idea.

30:37.010 --> 30:56.875
and that was that she had some things about the pollution of that river in her book that the publishers weren't so sure about, and Wilma herself convinced them that she would tell this particular tale as part of the chapter along the line of the mystery story, and therefore we have the chapter in

30:56.855 --> 31:06.689
the book on the killing of the French bra, which I believe is one of the earlier mentions of the problems of rivers in any of the rivers' books.

31:06.749 --> 31:24.313
Now that I've said that, I'm sure someone else will correct me, but at any rate, I think it's an important link, early link between, of the various strands that we are trying to bring together to, are soon to be developed, there is a new Rivers of America project.

31:24.293 --> 31:29.521
Another important part of it is the folk life, which was mentioned.

31:30.282 --> 31:45.947
The songs, not just, well, we're going to talk about the songs of the river, we're going to hear some of the songs, but it's that link with the regional folklore, the tales, the stories of the river, the folk of the river.

31:45.927 --> 31:56.980
And in the partnership that we're developing within the Library of Congress, the American Booklight Center is going to play and has already played a prominent role with the Center for the Book.

31:57.000 --> 32:14.500
And we hope to add, as I've mentioned earlier, the Geography and Math Division, perhaps the, I hope, the Poetry and Literature Office, and lo and behold, even our National Digital Library, which doesn't know too much about this project yet, but I think it's important that we have talked

32:14.480 --> 32:31.510
And I have talked with them because they're doing teachers institutes and I think the river local history is so important in demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of our collection with the library and it's a natural way for us to move through.

32:31.490 --> 32:47.845
To conclude argument, the American Folklife Center through Alan Dabour, his director whom I mentioned earlier, and Joe Hickerson, excuse me Joe, argument resents.

32:47.825 --> 33:01.408
Some Psalms of the Rivers, I believe loosely based on the wonderful book, Psalms of the Rivers, in the Rivers of America series, edited by Carl Carmer, whose name is coming up again.

33:02.029 --> 33:08.820
Music arranged by Dr. Albert Sermay, who Carol can tell us about Dr. Sermay.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.803
but published at the early days of 1942.

33:11.863 --> 33:23.334
There's a copy of this book, which I understand is one of the rarest books in the series on display in the exhibit of Carol's books next door.

33:23.354 --> 33:36.307
I hope you look once the program is over, but at this time I'd like to turn the program over to Alan Ford.

33:36.327 --> 33:36.607
Alan.

33:36.947 --> 33:37.508
Thank you.

33:38.197 --> 33:41.861
Thank you so much.

33:42.421 --> 33:55.255
Well, I learned a great thought, a great place in hearing, as I said earlier, that in order to be restored, the river has to be restored.

33:55.716 --> 34:00.360
And in that spirit, I didn't have no time for any story, but I'll tell you a story about myself.

34:00.380 --> 34:01.842
My wife and I began visiting old times,

34:02.378 --> 34:15.225
North Carolina and Virginia and West Virginia in the 60s, and on into the 70s, where I got promoted to the level of my council.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.594
And during that period, in visiting old-time settlers,

34:19.574 --> 34:36.998
I began to document their tradition, and that was the initial effort, but in time I was drawn to as well and learned from my new masters in Old Time Sibling.

34:37.519 --> 34:42.426
But one of the things that struck me as I learned the repertory of Old Time Sibling in the Upper South

34:43.047 --> 34:49.536
was the fact that an astonishing number of the Philippines were named after Creece and Rivers.

34:50.518 --> 35:03.657
And at first, I didn't know what to make of this, or perhaps I attributed this to the fact that Creece and Rivers was where they lived, and they were interesting, and so we named them after them.

35:03.677 --> 35:05.359
I didn't make much of it.

35:05.379 --> 35:12.109
But when it grew from dozens to hundreds of Philippines named after Creece and Rivers,

35:12.308 --> 35:17.293
I had to think perhaps something more was at work here.

35:18.395 --> 35:30.067
And the clues of something more being at work came to me when I was visiting West Virginia in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.

35:30.708 --> 35:40.358
And in asking about where people lived and how to get there, for the first time struck me, which I had encountered many times,

35:40.709 --> 35:50.699
that in describing how to get to where somebody lived, they didn't say, well, you go down the road, and then you cut the back of the other road, and then you go up the hill.

35:51.480 --> 35:57.947
They said, well, you go back over the mountain, and then you take the north fork of Cranberry down.

35:59.828 --> 36:06.295
And I realized that all their descriptions of geography, their way of locating themselves

36:10.072 --> 36:14.957
rivers with the arterial connection between them and the world.

36:15.177 --> 36:19.081
And so this wasn't simply naming nothing plainly interesting.

36:19.162 --> 36:27.150
This was naming their geography as a way that they linked themselves to the world around them.

36:27.170 --> 36:35.959
And in that spirit, I'd like to tell you one utility named after a well-known river in West Virginia, the Chief Decker.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.762
This team is called three-fourths of Chiefs

36:39.265 --> 36:44.231
The three-quarters of Teeth are in one of the upper areas of the Teeth River.

36:44.251 --> 36:45.900
Teeth is one of those rivers

36:46.387 --> 36:50.852
There are a number of rivers in the United States that flow north.

36:51.112 --> 37:00.443
And if you live on any one of these rivers in the United States that flows north, you say, we're the only person living on the most flowing river in the world.

37:01.624 --> 37:02.425
I live on the St.

37:02.505 --> 37:03.467
John's River of Florida.

37:03.507 --> 37:10.875
We are very proud of you living on the only most flowing river in the world.

37:10.855 --> 37:15.239
We forgot about the Nile.

37:15.259 --> 37:26.309
But we forgot about the Chief, too, and many of the rivers and America itself.

37:26.329 --> 37:27.950
So here's the three-fourths of Chief.

37:27.970 --> 37:32.675
I have to say, this is a tune that was not well-rendered, not made.

37:33.095 --> 37:38.500
Reminds me, actually, of him, a tax-gaining mountain stream.

37:38.952 --> 38:04.324
It has a kind of a lovely quality and it begins right at the top of the team.

38:04.344 --> 38:04.765
This way it can't be.

38:04.785 --> 38:05.145
The further it is.

38:06.391 --> 38:27.842
Thank you.

38:29.290 --> 38:58.717
.

38:58.737 --> 38:58.757
.

38:59.075 --> 39:25.373
I'd like to introduce for the evening of Joe Dickerson, who's head of the Archive of the Book Culture within the American Book Life Center.

39:25.393 --> 39:25.774
There he is.

39:26.075 --> 39:42.056
And Joe is going to switch us from instrumental tunes, little tunes, to the world of salt.

39:42.076 --> 39:42.597
So, Joe.

39:42.617 --> 39:46.362
When John asked me to sing a song or two about rivers,

39:46.915 --> 39:50.498
I looked through the songwriter book.

39:50.879 --> 39:55.343
Great songs in there, so I could sing, Bank of the Ohio.

39:56.785 --> 40:02.330
I killed her down by the Bank of the Ohio.

40:02.390 --> 40:12.720
The Range of the Buffalo, which in passing Peace River, that would take about 15 minutes for me to sing, and Peace River would be in there once.

40:13.358 --> 40:18.051
And we were talking about new rivers.

40:18.151 --> 40:24.629
What about the American Self-Life Center's New River Project in West Virginia?

40:25.291 --> 40:27.958
I think we'll hear more about that, the New River Project.

40:28.411 --> 40:32.498
So I decided to go back to a song that I learned in 1957.

40:32.939 --> 40:39.711
Well, I didn't learn, because in 1957 I went to graduate school at Indiana University in Wilmington.

40:39.731 --> 40:48.327
And Ellen Stecker was a fellow graduate student, and she sang a song called The Brassos River, or the rivers of Texas.

40:49.201 --> 41:00.063
And it turns out to be a song that was recorded, collected by Vance Randolph, the premier collector of folk songs and folklore of the Women's Arts in Arkansas.

41:00.083 --> 41:05.755
They're doing major projects within the American Folklife Center, National Digital Library.

41:07.057 --> 41:09.302
We'll be there with Vance Randolph.

41:09.518 --> 41:18.671
But he met a woman named Ivy Claraville of Fayette Hill, Arkansas, in 1942, and who sang this song.

41:18.851 --> 41:23.217
And she had heard it in 1921 from a hired man who had been impacted.

41:24.499 --> 41:29.746
Now, when I went to IU, I used to sing the choruses of this song.

41:29.766 --> 41:32.370
I used to sing the harmonies of this chorus.

41:33.042 --> 41:40.478
because Ronald Stecker and Bruce Buckley signed along, and we had a group called The Settlers.

41:40.498 --> 41:49.397
Back in 1957, we were going to make some trios, and the rest is history.

41:50.035 --> 42:13.022
but this has this is a this is a song called the brazos river or the rivers of texas and i will do a footnote at the end about the nebraska version if anybody is here from nebraska but what i will do is i will render the chorus first

42:14.774 --> 42:19.023
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, give me your hand.

42:19.624 --> 42:23.292
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, give me your hand.

42:23.834 --> 42:27.461
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, give me your hand.

42:27.963 --> 42:32.833
There's many on the river that waters the land.

42:33.370 --> 42:35.753
Any questions thus far?

42:36.574 --> 42:37.295
No questions?

42:37.315 --> 42:37.575
Good.

42:37.595 --> 42:41.460
Everyone sing it.

42:41.480 --> 42:59.462
Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie, Lie,

42:59.442 --> 43:05.028
Now this song has more rivers for you and wine than any of the song I know, that's why I took it.

43:05.549 --> 43:12.597
We crossed the broad Pecos, we forded the new sets, we swung the Guadalupe, we followed the Brazos.

43:13.178 --> 43:21.467
Red River runs rusty, the bridge is hot clear, but down by the Brazos I courted my ear.

43:21.903 --> 43:29.472
Fly, fly, fly, easily, give me your hand.

43:29.492 --> 43:31.655
Fly, fly, fly, easily, give me your hand.

43:34.458 --> 43:37.121
Fly, fly, fly, easily, give me your hand.

43:37.141 --> 43:42.628
There's many on the earth that's water to land.

43:43.013 --> 44:06.793
the fair antonini runs glossy and blinding the crooked colorado runs weaving and winding the slow san antonio of course there's the plane but i never will walk by the brazos again

44:06.773 --> 44:11.539
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, give me your hand.

44:12.440 --> 44:16.345
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, give me your hand.

44:16.966 --> 44:21.972
There were many of the birds and monitors go hand.

44:22.893 --> 44:27.138
She hugged me, she kissed me, she called me her dandy.

44:27.519 --> 44:31.604
The Trinity is muddy, the brass rose quick sandy.

44:32.064 --> 44:34.367
She hugged me, she kissed me.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.642
She called me her own.

44:37.082 --> 44:46.672
But down by the ground, though, she left me alone.

44:49.134 --> 44:50.115
Lie, lie, lie, dearie, dearie, give me your hand.

44:50.135 --> 44:51.737
Lie, lie, lie, dearie, dearie, give me your hand.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.722
Lie, lie, lie, dearie, dearie, give me your hand.

44:57.843 --> 45:03.088
The trench is the money, but the breath of quicksand.

45:03.068 --> 45:07.754
The girls of Little River, they're pumped and they're pretty.

45:07.774 --> 45:11.700
The Sabine and the Sulphur have many a beauty.

45:12.401 --> 45:16.606
Down the banks of the Natchez, there are girls by the store.

45:17.207 --> 45:22.174
But down by the breath, there's no wonder no more.

45:22.915 --> 45:28.182
Then lie, lie, lie, leave me, give me your hand.

45:28.162 --> 45:48.094
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.

45:48.833 --> 45:54.383
I had a friend from Nebraska who couldn't remember all those words, all those words, that's why.

45:54.483 --> 45:56.587
I can't remember either of them.

45:56.607 --> 46:04.581
And so she made up a version about Nebraska, which went something like,

46:05.354 --> 46:20.376
We crossed the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we swung the Platte, we swung the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte, we fought in the Platte.

46:28.945 --> 46:35.629
People who sing about rivers are pretty colorful too.

46:35.649 --> 46:35.850
Wonderful.

46:36.387 --> 46:37.448
Thank you, that is.

46:37.649 --> 46:41.734
I will say that everyone here is invited to the continuation of tomorrow.

46:42.294 --> 46:50.825
We're going to have a continental breakfast in the mountain room, which is on the sixth floor of this room, this building, as you come up to the center elevators.

46:50.885 --> 46:55.851
The morning program, we're going to hear more about the books.

46:57.253 --> 47:01.238
We're going to hear an overview of the Rivers of America.

47:01.258 --> 47:06.124
We're going to talk together in a discussion among the authors of the books.

47:06.222 --> 47:14.977
We're going to learn about the exhibition of the books down in Vanderbilt and some of the bibliographic kinds of considerations.

47:14.998 --> 47:19.786
We'll talk with the illustrators about illustrating the books and what happens and share stories.

47:20.948 --> 47:28.281
We also will hear, as I said, after we'll talk a little bit about the editing of the books at noon.

47:28.261 --> 47:40.104
We will learn in the afternoon, as I said from Alley on the Cloud, about rivers that didn't make the series and what we might want to do about it to look ahead for the new project.

47:40.785 --> 47:46.135
And we will have a panel about collecting the books and selling the books.

47:46.115 --> 47:56.148
later in the afternoon and then wind up by any kinds of reminiscences that anybody would like to make for the documentation project about the Rivers of America.

47:56.168 --> 47:58.611
You're all invited.

47:58.771 --> 48:01.555
I hope you can join us on the way out tonight.

48:01.575 --> 48:06.121
Please take a look at the book on cells on display in the room next door.

48:06.141 --> 48:11.107
That's what has brought us together and that's what we need as our starting point for the new project.

48:11.367 --> 48:13.590
Thanks for joining us.

48:17.249 --> 48:24.863
Did you ever work with Marlowe, Joe, and Andrew on the full police series?
