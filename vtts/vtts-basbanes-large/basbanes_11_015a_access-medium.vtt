WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:11.014
It's the lowest plateau of three.

00:11.034 --> 00:15.201
There are three different platas, and here we are on the lowest level.

00:15.221 --> 00:28.705
And it's called Tila del Belvedere because it used to be one, because of its position, it used to be on the slope of the Vatican hill.

00:29.039 --> 00:37.128
and the courtyard was built across this courtyard in the middle 16th century by Pope VI.

00:38.409 --> 00:56.970
So some of the buildings around this courtyard go back, date back to the 15th century but the library, the building with the library's house today is the 16th century building and the library used to be upstairs

00:57.237 --> 01:17.763
will visit the Sistine Hall, which is now the place, it's part of the Vatican Museum, so you can visit that when you go around the museum tour.

01:18.403 --> 01:26.113
It is used for exhibitions, it's a place for exhibitions or meetings.

01:26.313 --> 01:42.953
The library used to be smaller, through, down, more or less the corner of the corner.

01:42.973 --> 01:53.346
But first, there is evidence of the library being here by the Pope's seat from the very first, very first centuries.

01:53.506 --> 01:53.926
Really?

01:53.946 --> 01:54.447
Yes.

01:54.781 --> 02:21.784
But the, shall we say, the first evidence of a library which was created for scholars, just not as a Pope's private own library, but as a library open to the public, was with Pope Nicholas Fix.

02:22.642 --> 02:28.148
And so we are at the middle of the 15th century.

02:28.949 --> 02:36.757
And his follower, 6th to 4th, then assigned to the library.

02:36.798 --> 02:44.025
There's a room and a staff.

02:44.046 --> 02:48.150
That was a chain, is that a chain library?

02:48.470 --> 02:50.893
Yes, that was a chain library, yes.

02:52.477 --> 02:58.288
Some of the furniture of the library survived and we'll see it upstairs.

02:58.308 --> 03:01.093
Oh, wonderful.

03:01.113 --> 03:01.193
Yes.

03:01.213 --> 03:01.333
Okay.

03:01.353 --> 03:15.058
Anyway, the library then over the century grew because of the... quite a variety of different collections were added to the initial collection of manuscripts.

03:15.376 --> 03:17.439
Manuscripts?

03:17.479 --> 03:32.018
Then today the library is not simply a library, but there's also a museum which is part of the library consisting of more than 20,000 pieces.

03:33.359 --> 03:34.661
These are museum pieces?

03:34.681 --> 03:36.623
Yes, museum pieces.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.565
Artifactual things.

03:37.585 --> 03:37.785
Yes, yes.

03:38.045 --> 03:44.033
Sacred art and profane art, ivories, bronzes, glasses, dress codes,

03:44.722 --> 03:47.947
other animal.

03:47.967 --> 03:50.912
Were they acquired in the course of acquiring books?

03:50.932 --> 03:51.994
Is this how they mainly came?

03:52.235 --> 04:02.111
Yes, they were acquired as collections, so they were either donated to the library or purchased by the library.

04:02.131 --> 04:10.425
During, of course, in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, the

04:10.979 --> 04:28.985
The distinction between a library and a museum was not so clear, so in fact it was just a collection and it was meant as a collection of cultural artifacts.

04:29.005 --> 04:32.229
Do they have any scholarly significance, do you think?

04:32.670 --> 04:34.793
Oh yes, yes, indeed.

04:35.583 --> 04:44.695
I will show that part of it is an exhibit, which is exhibited in the galleries, in the two galleries upstairs.

04:44.715 --> 04:52.785
Then there's a coin collection, which is quite a large one, an extensive one.

04:53.046 --> 05:01.697
It consists of several hundred thousand pieces of items.

05:01.717 --> 05:04.020
It's the largest with respect to papal

05:04.220 --> 05:22.639
coins and medals, and one of the largest, I think it's the second, this is the, the, to the Louvre, the one in the, yes, in France, for Roman, coins of the Roman Republic.

05:26.684 --> 05:32.590
And then there's a collection of engravings and drawings.

05:32.873 --> 05:52.806
And that again is a consequence of the acquisition of entire collections around the second half of the 18th century, already

05:53.174 --> 06:17.663
some hundreds bound volumes consisting of about 42,000 prints and engravings were arranged according to different criteria like the gender or the school of the artists and those other ones.

06:18.301 --> 06:30.876
So today, and then of course there is a collection of manuscripts, part of which are the original bulk of the original collection.

06:31.137 --> 06:36.303
When I say original collection, I mean the 15th century collection.

06:36.363 --> 06:44.393
Nothing survived from the very third or fourth century library.

06:44.997 --> 07:08.855
Do you think those materials from the 3rd or 4th century were obviously just documenting the particular popes, the papacy, they weren't necessarily going out systematically as they started in the 15th and 16th centuries and developed this more humanistic kind of approach that went well beyond strictly theological concerns?

07:08.935 --> 07:10.718
How would you say that the library

07:11.052 --> 07:15.056
No, this is not really a theological idea.

07:16.237 --> 07:18.239
I understand that.

07:18.319 --> 07:24.306
No, I think that the first collections were just dispersed.

07:24.326 --> 07:31.313
It was intended as the Pope's own private library.

07:31.813 --> 07:35.457
So, following the dead of the Pope,

07:35.892 --> 07:45.070
It was either taken by his relatives or... So it was not.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.711
It was not.

07:45.731 --> 07:52.163
It never meant as a library belonging to the state, to the Catholic state, the Holy See.

07:52.143 --> 08:13.657
It was just after Sixtus the Fourth and Nicholas the Fifth that the library then became the Madison Library and the library opened to scholars, Nicholas the Fourth, scholars that Nicholas the Fifth started his collection as a settlement collection from his own.

08:14.518 --> 08:18.825
With the idea that it would be made available to... It would be made available, yes.

08:19.430 --> 08:20.151
Yes, exactly.

08:20.231 --> 08:23.135
That's quite a critical decision, isn't it, at some point?

08:23.215 --> 08:26.099
Yes, indeed, yes.

08:26.119 --> 08:37.596
Shall I say, it is considered one of the earliest modern libraries in English.

08:37.616 --> 08:49.352
Of course, the idea of readers at the time was quite different from readers, what you would call readers and scholars today, but nevertheless, it was their library was open to scholars.

08:51.931 --> 09:07.442
The library was in recent years, say in the 20s and 30s, the library was reorganised following the Anglo-American tradition of libraries.

09:08.198 --> 09:15.885
And also new stacks were created.

09:15.905 --> 09:38.087
You see this building, it's all dismantled inside, and there's a new, like a tower, built structure of stacks, which go, which have, they're not relying on the walls of the structure of the building,

09:38.067 --> 09:44.094
But they have their own foundations, of course.

09:44.574 --> 09:49.940
And these stacks were made of solid steel.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.842
They were made in Pittsburgh.

09:52.162 --> 10:00.031
And then they were shipped to that and reassembled here.

10:00.111 --> 10:05.897
It was one of the earliest modular library stacks.

10:06.147 --> 10:11.607
At what point did you start cataloging systematically?

10:11.627 --> 10:14.678
In the... In the 20s.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.765
In the late 20s.

10:16.998 --> 10:36.238
The Leibniz-Franz's cataloguing rules were translated into Italian and make it more, I wish I would say, we had to cater for special problems, problems which would cause consequences of the specificity of the

10:36.218 --> 10:45.169
material that was held in these libraries, for instance, ancient books or religious matters.

10:45.590 --> 10:51.157
So some of the rules were just customised, so to say.

10:51.177 --> 10:58.185
But in general, the cataloguing rules were very much the same as the translation.

10:58.205 --> 11:01.129
And also the subject cataloguing was carried out

11:01.109 --> 11:07.658
following the same American, Anglo-American tradition.

11:07.678 --> 11:09.800
But prior to that, there was a record of what you had.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.465
How would a scholar know what to look for, what to ask for?

11:14.026 --> 11:17.090
There were handwritten inventories.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.994
Well, the catalogs.

11:20.014 --> 11:22.657
That's an interesting phrase, handwritten inventories.

11:22.677 --> 11:23.719
Yes, handwritten inventories.

11:25.461 --> 11:29.226
Kept in codex-type books, or were they...?

11:29.341 --> 11:33.668
Yes, kept in volumes.

11:36.413 --> 11:42.523
Did you keep a record of provenance, of years of acquisition, from whom, from where, that they were purchased, that they were given?

11:42.543 --> 11:43.385
Oh, yes, yes.

11:43.405 --> 11:45.128
So that's very carefully made, those records.

11:45.148 --> 11:52.480
Yes, the information is kept in the art house of the library.

11:56.527 --> 12:01.676
There are archives which are distinguished from the secret archives.

12:01.696 --> 12:07.085
The secret archives are the state archives.

12:07.105 --> 12:10.151
Historical and current archives.

12:10.171 --> 12:12.114
And that's what they call the secret archives.

12:12.134 --> 12:12.915
The secret archives, yes.

12:13.336 --> 12:18.024
Whereas the archives belonging to the library are the library zone.

12:18.225 --> 12:21.370
They have nothing to do with the state archives.

12:21.873 --> 12:24.135
Are they secret in the purest sense?

12:24.235 --> 12:27.198
Can a scholar request access to any of them?

12:27.218 --> 12:27.838
Oh, yes, yes.

12:27.879 --> 12:33.003
Secret is from the Latin word secretum, which means with, together with.

12:33.424 --> 12:43.052
So it was the archives that had to travel with the Pope and be wherever he was, had to follow him.

12:43.072 --> 12:47.236
So the word secretum, with him, this is the word secret.

12:47.256 --> 12:51.340
It's nothing to do with secret in the sense of something hidden.

12:51.387 --> 12:52.508
Like sectator.

12:52.528 --> 12:54.830
Yes, like sectator, for instance.

12:54.850 --> 12:57.593
The same origin of the word sectator.

12:57.613 --> 13:01.236
So a scholar can't put access, and in many cases it will be granted.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.978
Oh yes, yes, yes.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.000
That's very important to understand.

13:05.020 --> 13:08.103
People might misunderstand the central secret archives.

13:08.143 --> 13:08.443
Yes.

13:09.784 --> 13:21.175
They are open, of course, the last 50 or 75 years are closed because as in any other country, of course.

13:23.315 --> 13:29.463
During times of war, did all the materials stay here?

13:29.503 --> 13:33.688
Did they ever have fear that they might be destroyed?

13:33.708 --> 13:33.909
No.

13:34.009 --> 13:35.270
And removed into some safe place?

13:35.391 --> 13:38.415
Even other libraries were taken to this.

13:38.435 --> 13:39.035
Oh, right here?

13:39.095 --> 13:42.720
Yes, they were taken.

13:42.780 --> 13:48.267
From a scene, of course.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.510
I have a question.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.972
We were at the Ambrosiana.

13:52.458 --> 14:10.703
last week, and during the course of our interview there, this father who was showing us around indicated that there are something in excess of 1,100 ecclesiastical libraries in Italy, accounting for perhaps as many as 27 million volumes, which is extraordinary.

14:10.723 --> 14:13.887
I mean, that may even be more than what the state library system has.

14:14.388 --> 14:19.495
And I wonder, is the Vatican Library considered part of the ecclesiastical system, or is it unique?

14:20.082 --> 14:22.265
Is it the Vatican Library?

14:22.325 --> 14:26.450
Well, it's like the National Library of the Vatican.

14:28.092 --> 14:35.562
So it's both an ecclesiastic library, but it wouldn't be ecclesiastic.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.145
It is a religious library.

14:38.165 --> 14:41.569
It's not a religious library.

14:41.629 --> 14:44.453
So it's not part of the ecclesiastic system there.

14:45.209 --> 14:48.114
What would you call it if you don't call it Ecclesiastes?

14:48.134 --> 14:49.095
Research library.

14:50.858 --> 14:58.170
And you also said the National Library of the Vatican, which is very interesting.

14:58.191 --> 15:01.796
That's very interesting.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.259
Did you have a question?

15:03.279 --> 15:05.082
You were about to ask me.

15:05.122 --> 15:11.773
One of the things we're looking at also is national libraries, as repositories of national culture, how a library works.

15:12.125 --> 15:15.609
different countries have different ways of different approaches.

15:16.290 --> 15:16.591
Yes.

15:16.611 --> 15:20.496
And of course I hadn't thought of the Vatican Library in terms of being a national library.

15:21.357 --> 15:22.278
That's quite interesting.

15:22.558 --> 15:25.102
Yes.

15:25.302 --> 15:28.326
Well, of course it wasn't a nation until 1929.

15:28.947 --> 15:29.728
That's right.

15:29.868 --> 15:32.051
So it's a... 1929?

15:32.471 --> 15:35.135
The Lateran Pact.

15:35.175 --> 15:41.743
This came along just in passing, but I wondered why, and of course I'm not asking you to comment formally on this matter,

15:42.365 --> 15:45.309
In Italy, there are a number of national libraries.

15:45.329 --> 15:51.676
It's not like in the United States, where we have this huge country, we have one national library in Washington or in Britain that's in London.

15:52.197 --> 15:54.480
Here in Italy, they have, what, six, eight?

15:54.500 --> 15:54.620
Yes.

15:54.700 --> 16:00.007
There are two central national libraries and eight national libraries.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.189
And I wonder why they are so dispersed.

16:02.450 --> 16:05.754
Because of the history of Italy.

16:05.774 --> 16:06.735
Italy was...

16:06.985 --> 16:17.541
until not very long ago, divided into many different states, with small, like smaller, with sovereigns.

16:17.741 --> 16:20.485
So they came to their libraries.

16:20.506 --> 16:24.792
It was the national library of a small state, like, for instance,

16:24.974 --> 16:31.005
in Lombardy or Tuscany or Naples or the south of Italy.

16:31.485 --> 16:38.558
So they were the library of that small, small, more or less small state.

16:38.578 --> 16:41.483
It's similar to Germany as a library of Bavaria or Saxony.

16:41.503 --> 16:49.918
That's right, but they have more or less pulled them together into the... In Italy then, because the capital

16:50.152 --> 16:54.156
a city moved first to Florence and then to Rome.

16:54.176 --> 16:58.160
Then there are two central libraries, one in Florence and one in Rome.

16:58.400 --> 17:03.665
But do they replicate each other in terms of collecting interest or do they try and complement each other?

17:03.865 --> 17:04.426
Not really.

17:04.486 --> 17:10.752
The national library, central library in Florence is the national cataloguing agency.

17:10.772 --> 17:15.737
They produce the current national bibliography.

17:15.937 --> 17:22.087
Whereas the library in Rome is responsible for cataloguing foreign material.

17:23.169 --> 17:23.990
Okay, good.

17:24.150 --> 17:29.058
So there is, it's not a duplication.

17:29.599 --> 17:31.422
There is quite a lot of overlap though.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.185
Which is good.

17:33.205 --> 17:39.295
Yes, because of the legal deposit books have to be

17:39.460 --> 17:53.217
books have to be given in several copies, one of which goes to Florence, another one goes to Rome, or to the nearest National Library.

17:54.108 --> 18:04.048
And then, according to the nature of the book, a third copy would go either to a university library, to a research library, or to a public library.

18:04.730 --> 18:08.056
Is there a similar kind of a depository arrangement with the Vatican?

18:08.076 --> 18:12.285
I mean, do you require books that may be published by...

18:12.637 --> 18:19.652
Catholic churches or universities or whatever, are they required to deposit these books here, I wonder?

18:21.076 --> 18:25.545
Not if the universities do not belong to the Vatican.

18:25.565 --> 18:32.721
Those pontipical universities in Rome, for instance, they are not part of the Vatican in the States.

18:33.308 --> 18:36.193
So, with the exception of St.

18:36.233 --> 18:43.023
John Latin, which is in fact under the same administration of the Vatican language.

18:43.805 --> 18:48.532
So we don't get their books as a rule.

18:48.572 --> 18:54.742
We get most of their publications, most of their theses, for instance, but not all of them.

18:54.762 --> 19:00.531
Anyway, because of the nature of this library, it's a good...

19:01.034 --> 19:09.427
To get all this material would make things very... I mean, it would create a problem with space.

19:09.447 --> 19:10.168
Storage, yes.

19:10.548 --> 19:11.910
Do you have any upstate storage?

19:12.291 --> 19:13.573
No.

19:13.673 --> 19:15.055
Are you contemplating any of that?

19:15.075 --> 19:15.296
Yes.

19:17.239 --> 19:17.839
Where would you go?

19:18.240 --> 19:28.155
Oh, well, I mean, I don't know at the moment, but I suppose it would be somewhere in some other place here in Rome where we have...

19:28.726 --> 19:30.228
which is extraterritorial.

19:31.370 --> 19:39.123
Could be, for instance, the radio station in Santa Maria Vigalaria or some building, I don't know.

19:39.143 --> 19:44.271
I know that this is something we are considering in the fish.

19:44.291 --> 19:51.402
For the time being, what we did, we tried to, shall we say, optimize the use of space.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.447
You will see that the building, because of the

19:55.085 --> 20:18.575
Being in such an ancient building, you have very nice Jose rooms, but it's also quite a waste of space because, for instance, you have big tall ceilings or frescoes and thick marble floors, but then it's difficult to run cables.

20:19.356 --> 20:23.421
So we're now opening, and I'll show it to you later,

20:23.755 --> 20:27.301
the new periodical reading room.

20:28.964 --> 20:33.271
And that makes quite a lot of space.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.677
And then just quickly, do you deaccession anything?

20:36.737 --> 20:38.420
Oh yes, yes, deaccession.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.243
Deaccession?

20:40.363 --> 20:41.906
Deaccession, no, no.

20:41.926 --> 20:49.358
Just maybe every now and again duplicates, duplicates, especially if they are modern duplicates.

20:52.325 --> 20:56.970
Most cases they would be used for exchange.

20:58.151 --> 21:02.996
But you don't go through the collections and weave things?

21:03.016 --> 21:03.176
No.

21:04.197 --> 21:04.878
Not so far.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.841
And then just in terms of numbers?

21:09.763 --> 21:10.624
Printed books?

21:10.684 --> 21:14.408
Yeah, 1.6 million printed books.

21:15.449 --> 21:18.973
8,300 inch anabula.

21:19.865 --> 21:25.474
150,000 manuscripts.

21:25.714 --> 21:26.034
Wow.

21:27.877 --> 21:28.779
That's a question.

21:28.799 --> 21:34.287
65,000 manuscripts are just codices.

21:34.307 --> 21:42.420
Most of them are Latin, Greek, and Oriental manuscripts.

21:42.440 --> 21:47.307
And the collection of medieval manuscripts is one of the largest in the world.

21:48.873 --> 21:51.857
They're probably the most important ones.

21:51.877 --> 21:59.328
Well, it's one of the, as regards medieval manuscripts, of course, not modern manuscripts.

21:59.348 --> 22:03.634
Modern manuscript leads not very significant.

22:03.654 --> 22:13.609
I mean, not compared with out of collections, Library of Congress, or British Library, or Bibliothek National, of course.

22:13.869 --> 22:17.935
This would be compared to the Bodleian libraries, if you want to.

22:18.573 --> 22:24.201
In this sense, it's a research historical light.

22:24.221 --> 22:27.104
Okay, great.

22:27.125 --> 22:31.891
Before I forget, could you spell your name for me and your title so I can attribute you properly?

22:31.911 --> 22:33.834
Okay, Weston, W-E-S-T-O-N.

22:36.818 --> 22:38.540
And the first name?

22:39.541 --> 22:40.142
Paul.

22:40.477 --> 22:41.599
Chiefs and George?

22:42.440 --> 22:42.820
Gabriel.

22:43.101 --> 22:43.722
Gabriel.

22:43.742 --> 22:45.384
And your title here, sir?

22:45.404 --> 22:49.970
And I'm responsible for the automation project.

22:50.291 --> 22:53.675
Oh, I want to talk about that, too.

22:53.695 --> 22:58.182
Of course, we're dealing with libraries of the future in this new book.

22:58.202 --> 23:01.486
You have brought quite a bit of automation into this library.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.370
Okay.

23:04.991 --> 23:09.117
I've heard, I know that I've

23:09.434 --> 23:30.700
seeing you before, because I live here and Father Boyle was, I think I, at one point when I was thinking of doing a story on the materialization of the library, Father Boyle had told me to speak with you, so I'm very glad to have made this.

23:30.680 --> 23:49.086
I'll give, my name is Lucy Gordon and I'm a journalist here.

23:50.488 --> 23:53.372
But I'm a, thank you.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.814
It's as though it's hard to see.

23:55.250 --> 24:15.486
Is it Dr. Weston, by the way?

24:15.466 --> 24:34.622
Well, actually... Thank you, indeed.

24:34.602 --> 24:58.367
I was responsible for banking force.

24:58.387 --> 25:04.153
Back in 1984, when the operation... The operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation of the operation.

25:04.808 --> 25:11.296
And you were born in England?

25:11.336 --> 25:15.220
I was born in Rome, but then lived in England until it came.

25:18.624 --> 25:19.525
We moved to Rome.

25:20.927 --> 25:21.828
This is very modern.

25:22.248 --> 25:23.950
Yeah, this is very modern.

25:23.970 --> 25:28.596
This is the periodical greeting room.

25:28.616 --> 25:32.200
It would be open before the end of this event here.

25:33.918 --> 25:49.243
So we have about 8,500 periodic serial publications in current subscriptions.

25:49.403 --> 25:52.809
So they will all be here, open stacks.

25:53.770 --> 25:55.453
Scholars will be able to...

26:00.800 --> 26:09.330
There are about 25,000 titles.

26:10.951 --> 26:18.940
But this, of course, includes closed periodicals.

26:19.661 --> 26:25.828
Maybe we have just one couple of issues or the entire collection that the periodical has ceased for you.

26:26.365 --> 26:33.035
You suggested downstairs, and I think maybe I even interrupted you, but you said that the early readers are different from the readers of today.

26:33.315 --> 26:34.437
Yes.

26:35.078 --> 26:45.673
The readers of today, well, 60% of our readers come from abroad, that is, countries other than Italy.

26:46.374 --> 26:49.178
Actually, also those coming from Italy come from abroad.

26:51.562 --> 26:56.068
But 80% of our readers come from

26:56.504 --> 27:07.454
outside Rome, so we have quite a number of languages spoken in the library.

27:07.574 --> 27:15.661
I should say Italian is a lingua franca, but English, French, Spanish and German are the most.

27:19.204 --> 27:26.511
And in order to be a reader of the library you have to be

27:26.896 --> 27:34.324
either a professor or researcher or librarian.

27:34.344 --> 27:35.846
Students are not allowed.

27:37.287 --> 27:54.586
We have to be quite selective because of lack of space and also the importance of the collections, the uniqueness of the documents.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.548
We have to make sure that people can

27:57.187 --> 28:05.539
make good use of them, so this is why.

28:05.559 --> 28:22.584
You'll see upstairs in the reading room, there's room for about 220, 250 scholars at a time, so... Do you have a number as to how many you do approximately each year?

28:22.624 --> 28:24.066
How many people are allowed?

28:24.206 --> 28:25.708
Yes, about 6,000.

28:26.043 --> 28:26.844
6,500.

28:26.924 --> 28:38.842
The number of users has been growing quite regularly over the last 10, 15 years.

28:38.922 --> 28:46.334
So you give credentials to about 6,500 applicants, or you'd have 6,500 people coming in.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.938
One scholar might come in repeatedly over a period of weeks.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.440
Yes, that's right.

28:51.762 --> 28:53.164
So some have annual

28:53.701 --> 28:56.225
from its other half, just temporary.

29:03.396 --> 29:06.581
And then, what percent are GTS people?

29:06.601 --> 29:07.482
Oh, very small.

29:07.502 --> 29:09.185
I don't know.

29:09.405 --> 29:18.539
I mean, roughly, I would say about one, two percent, more than that.

29:18.559 --> 29:20.923
Because you're involved in the automation end,

29:21.376 --> 29:26.563
Are you working to scan the manuscripts, the ancient documents?

29:26.583 --> 29:27.224
Yes, yes.

29:27.244 --> 29:30.268
And I wonder where that stands in terms of percentages.

29:31.550 --> 29:35.336
How many of your documents have you digitized?

29:35.356 --> 29:36.798
Oh, a very, very small portion.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.220
Do you have a program to get them all done?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.121
It was a pilot project.

29:39.141 --> 29:43.026
We carried out a pilot project which lasted about 24 months.

29:44.108 --> 29:49.155
And during this project, we had a sample of, let's say,

29:49.793 --> 29:59.847
40,000 images from 50, 60 documents, 60 manuscripts.

29:59.867 --> 30:02.751
They were scanned in their entirety.

30:03.712 --> 30:08.399
When I say scanned, I don't mean optical recognition of the text.

30:08.479 --> 30:17.151
It's just the image, just the image of the, in a machine, shall we say, in digital form.

30:17.772 --> 30:47.543
and the idea is to create a database of images with a good number of our manuscripts and also other item pieces from the various collections and make them available in electronic form either through by the various networks like internet or

30:48.029 --> 31:01.246
But that would just be sort of as a reference to it, or in a more, as you say, better quality on CD-ROMs or other media.

31:01.747 --> 31:15.665
Do you foresee the day when a scholar comes here and asks to see such and such a manuscript, and you say, well, we have that digitized, we recommend that you read the copy and not the original?

31:15.806 --> 31:17.648
Do you think you foresee...

31:18.168 --> 31:20.611
Not allowing access to the original.

31:20.651 --> 31:21.672
Not really, no.

31:21.773 --> 31:32.566
Unless the manuscript is particularly precious or fragile, or in very bad condition, then we give the original to our scholars.

31:32.586 --> 31:36.110
Because, of course, they need the original for their studies.

31:36.451 --> 31:42.218
If you're studying the parchment, or the colours, or the

31:42.535 --> 32:12.492
uh or the ink that was used then you need or the even the handbag you need the original you have to go to the original no uh copying will replace the study of the original that's just you anticipated my next question only if you're studying well of course if you're studying the text or if you have some technological uh study you want to know which uh how many manuscripts have a lion with this

32:12.809 --> 32:16.995
write, put up, then in that case you can study.

32:18.016 --> 32:21.761
You can work on reproductions.

32:22.262 --> 32:24.605
If it's strictly a textual concern.

32:24.745 --> 32:25.085
Yes.

32:25.806 --> 32:36.281
Well, it's a textual concern and there are no problems like, say, rewriting the palimpsest, you know, things like that.

32:36.301 --> 32:41.888
Then you can have a sometimes a reproduction, a microfilm or

32:42.205 --> 32:47.330
or another kind of reproduction is even more legible than the original.

32:47.350 --> 33:05.349
Especially if the image was captured in special conditions like ultraviolets, wood lamps and things like that, then the contrast can be enhanced and the text can be more legible.

33:06.210 --> 33:11.335
We have tried some kind of what we call electronic

33:11.500 --> 33:41.288
restoration of manuscripts, and that is, when capturing the image of the manuscript, if the manuscript has some kind of deterioration, like fungi or other things, we can capture, we can find the, shall I say, the wavelength of that, what we can call noise, and of course the image is captured the way it appears in the document,

33:41.656 --> 33:46.262
But then you can ask the system to have that wavelength filtered.

33:47.464 --> 33:57.337
And then what you see is, in fact, the text without the deterioration, without the fungi.

33:57.777 --> 34:00.441
When you have a photograph, or even

34:00.573 --> 34:05.938
so you can take away molds and marks and stuff.

34:06.598 --> 34:07.379
That's excellent.

34:07.439 --> 34:13.744
And you have all of this machinery here, it's on site, or do you outsource it, as you say, in the United States?

34:13.844 --> 34:17.087
Well, yeah, partly outsource.

34:17.928 --> 34:29.938
This project has been a joint venture of three different institutions, the Catholic University at Rio de Janeiro,

34:30.053 --> 34:34.218
IBM International and the Vatican Library.

34:35.078 --> 34:58.744
And of course Rio de Janeiro were responsible for, shall we say, IBM was the technological partner involved, Vatican Library was at the know-how, provided the know-how in manuscripts, paleography, history, all those things, as well as the documents.

34:59.011 --> 35:06.985
And the University of Rio de Janeiro, they worked on the structure, on the fire structure.

35:08.548 --> 35:11.533
Have you heard of that before?

35:11.553 --> 35:11.733
No.

35:12.114 --> 35:12.936
There is a website.

35:12.976 --> 35:21.050
IBM did have a website on their work with the Vatican Library, but they really didn't go into any of the detail.

35:21.951 --> 35:23.294
And what do you call that?

35:23.314 --> 35:23.955
Electronics?

35:24.104 --> 35:25.927
Restoration.

35:25.987 --> 35:26.989
I love that phrase.

35:27.009 --> 35:29.373
I would have a lexicon of these phrases in my new book.

35:29.433 --> 35:34.863
Restoration, yeah, of manuscripts, actually.

35:34.883 --> 35:39.732
It's a kind of virtual restoration because you're leaving the document untouched.

35:40.213 --> 35:47.125
What you're doing is you are cleaning it electronically, removing all the noise, filtering it.

35:47.425 --> 35:51.810
And if you want to use another metaphor to medicine, it's not an invasive procedure.

35:51.890 --> 35:55.233
Oh, no, no, it's not at all an invasive procedure.

35:55.253 --> 36:16.977
In fact, you could have two texts, because of the cost of the parchment in the Middle Ages, of course, they used to sort of use the same piece of parchment several times.

36:17.648 --> 36:25.540
So, if you look at the text, you see just the very... Should I say just the most recent... The surface text.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.501
The surface text.

36:26.521 --> 36:35.635
But you don't see... If you read that under special life conditions, then you can read the text that was written underneath.

36:35.655 --> 36:38.940
And sometimes they may even be more interesting than what's on the surface.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.442
Sometimes they can, yes.

36:40.843 --> 36:44.989
In the past, in order to, should I say, magnify or to...

36:45.205 --> 37:07.991
They used to put the ink in some kind of, not ink, but it was some acids, and that has severely damaged the manuscript, because it has changed the organic structure of the manuscript.

37:08.692 --> 37:13.778
In using these special amps and these technical devices,

37:14.416 --> 37:21.525
Can you think offhand of any specific examples where you've discovered something like this?

37:22.046 --> 37:42.752
Well, any specific example of a very famous one that was in Decivita Today, that was rewritten over a piece of Cicero.

37:45.297 --> 37:53.911
And that would have been maybe then later published as a... That was, that was.

37:55.133 --> 37:59.220
No, that was studied by Cardinal Angelo Mai.

37:59.821 --> 38:00.142
Oh, yeah.

38:00.162 --> 38:03.167
It was Mai, Angelo Mai.

38:03.187 --> 38:05.931
It was last century.

38:06.132 --> 38:06.953
M-A-I.

38:08.095 --> 38:08.916
He discovered that.

38:08.996 --> 38:10.579
He discovered that, yes.

38:10.981 --> 38:12.603
That's interesting, yeah.

38:12.623 --> 38:12.923
That's good.

38:13.003 --> 38:13.564
The application.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.547
Well, the technology is there.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.309
I mean, people shouldn't be afraid of it.

38:18.329 --> 38:19.571
It is, you know.

38:21.493 --> 38:22.114
Let's get it.

38:25.958 --> 38:28.601
No, it's really fine.

38:28.641 --> 38:31.945
Yeah, no, it's really fine.

38:32.105 --> 38:36.090
Actually, it's a wonderful place.

38:36.170 --> 38:39.654
Oh, yes, it is.

38:39.754 --> 38:40.735
If you have...

38:41.035 --> 38:43.620
Do you have, uh, without flash?

38:43.901 --> 38:44.181
Yes.

38:44.201 --> 38:45.985
You can take the photograph.

38:46.005 --> 38:48.891
Do you want to have it on the table for you?

38:48.911 --> 38:49.732
Oh, that's fine.

38:49.813 --> 38:51.837
No, I'll... It's ready to go if you want.

38:51.857 --> 38:52.498
Oh, that's okay.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.783
I'll, uh... Yeah, it's going.

38:54.803 --> 38:54.903
Okay.

38:55.444 --> 38:56.887
That's very sweet.

38:57.047 --> 39:01.997
I, I, um... Where were these, that...

39:03.158 --> 39:04.840
They don't come from Pittsburgh.

39:05.300 --> 39:11.347
Oh, no, no, these are very... No, the company's the same, the same supplier.

39:12.969 --> 39:16.533
Uh, Stratford, Stratford Steelcase.

39:16.553 --> 39:18.135
They're the same suppliers.

39:19.036 --> 39:21.299
So these are also Americans, then?

39:21.820 --> 39:26.024
No, now this is a company in Italy.

39:26.385 --> 39:31.731
It's the same, the same...

39:33.247 --> 39:56.436
To go back to Angelo Maio's regular thing, how did he discover that they were written on top of each other?

39:57.293 --> 40:12.727
Well, he realized that the house... He wasn't a stick.

40:12.747 --> 40:14.348
Ah, I see.

40:14.368 --> 40:14.889
Is this Leo the 13th?

40:14.909 --> 40:21.955
Yes, Leo the 13th, yes.

40:21.975 --> 40:25.258
And this is the card, the catalogue... It's the Library of Congress.

40:26.133 --> 40:43.838
but is it um ceased so you're doing things on um and when did it see in 1985 it's a library of congress catalog well this is it's a replica

40:44.172 --> 40:46.696
Everything made there because of the life of Gondis.

40:46.716 --> 40:58.353
So if you want me to remember what the life of Gondis looked like in the 30s you come to the African island.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.937
Because this is all perfect.

41:00.957 --> 41:03.381
These shells and everything was the life of Gondis.

41:03.401 --> 41:04.622
Even the lamps, everything?

41:04.763 --> 41:07.747
Yeah.

41:07.767 --> 41:08.408
And...

41:09.569 --> 41:36.100
When this was brought in, it was a shock for the people working here because they were used to these wooden carved stacks, furniture, and they felt that all this iron and glass would be a bit, you know, very sort of cool and very not appropriate for the flag, but in fact they proved

41:36.400 --> 41:41.205
Over the years it was very, very solid, very good service.

41:46.330 --> 42:03.808
Holes to let the air through and the dust and also with all these rails so that you can move up and down the... Ventilation and adjustment duration.

42:05.037 --> 42:16.490
This is the printed material reference room here.

42:16.590 --> 42:19.713
The reading room is next door.

42:19.733 --> 42:26.281
The card catalog consists of almost a million and a half cards.

42:26.301 --> 42:30.846
You will realize, yes, 1.5 million cards.

42:30.926 --> 42:34.690
Some of the cards are, most of the cards are tight.

42:35.463 --> 42:46.439
But some of them are printed.

42:46.559 --> 42:58.156
So, you see, these are printed cards.

42:58.516 --> 43:03.343
These cards were printed, produced at the Library of Congress.

43:03.863 --> 43:09.410
There was an agreement between this Library of Congress and the Vatican.

43:09.530 --> 43:15.878
We did cataloging for them for books, either Italian or religious books.

43:15.898 --> 43:18.742
And then we got the parts in exchange.

43:19.183 --> 43:21.345
And this went on until 1943.

43:21.386 --> 43:23.228
This, by the way, is 1939.

43:23.829 --> 43:29.696
1943 because of the war.

43:29.716 --> 43:31.879
It was only resumed in the...

43:32.365 --> 43:44.340
in the 80s, late 80s, when, because of the introduction of automated procedure, we started re-importing, importing data from external sources.

43:44.980 --> 43:49.586
So we did derive cataloging from OCLC and Parlay.

43:50.107 --> 43:52.670
Have you done any retrospective conclusion of this?

43:52.810 --> 43:56.314
Yes, this is all being converted into machine readable.

43:56.598 --> 44:01.023
And the entire catalog is now available, is now accessible through internet.

44:01.043 --> 44:03.385
And do you keep the card catalog up to date?

44:03.446 --> 44:03.766
No.

44:04.046 --> 44:12.295
It's been closed in 1985 because we've changed the cataloging rules.

44:12.315 --> 44:21.686
We've moved from the Library of Congress rules of the 20s to AACR2 and American cataloging rules.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.710
And some of the headings are now

44:26.551 --> 44:34.943
quite different, not so much in the way of personal names, but corporate body names.

44:35.944 --> 44:43.294
They used to be entered under the name of the place, either the city or the country, the state.

44:44.035 --> 44:45.517
Now they go in direct order.

44:45.878 --> 44:54.229
Now in order to have those records filed with the others, one would have to either make cross-references or read

44:54.614 --> 45:09.012
re-write the re-input the heading and that was a terrible place because with so many cards it's difficult it is a difficult thing to find the noise especially some of the if you go to

45:09.751 --> 45:21.808
Cicero or Rome or Bible or Codence, you'll find that there are maybe six, ten floors.

45:22.889 --> 45:29.859
So it's very difficult to keep them in a good shape.

45:29.879 --> 45:31.741
Doctor, before I forget, do you have an email address?

45:31.922 --> 45:34.425
Yes.

45:35.249 --> 45:37.953
You mean the back and myself?

45:37.993 --> 45:44.283
I want to follow up and run some of your things by you so you can make sure they're right.

45:46.386 --> 46:00.447
My address is weston at librs6k dot vatlib.it

46:01.017 --> 46:02.539
It doesn't matter what case it is.

46:02.559 --> 46:05.404
Yes, it's lowercase.

46:05.544 --> 46:07.768
I love email.

46:10.231 --> 46:12.655
It's very efficient.

46:12.675 --> 46:13.056
Yes.

46:13.076 --> 46:19.406
And of course, this is also the internet address of the capital.

46:19.866 --> 46:23.732
Anything I quote you on, I'll be happy to run by you.

46:23.753 --> 46:24.454
Right, okay.

46:24.854 --> 46:27.999
So you have an opportunity to make sure everything is right.

46:28.059 --> 46:28.560
Right.

46:29.182 --> 46:34.690
Is this the only library in the world that has a library school attached to it?

46:35.191 --> 46:35.431
Yes.

46:35.652 --> 46:46.908
Well, I don't know if it's the only one, but it's certainly quite a... It's quite rare to have a library school attached to a library.

46:47.730 --> 46:55.982
It was, again, a consequence of the restructuring of the library in the late 20s.

46:56.587 --> 47:21.527
As the new rules and the new organization of the library came from the States, then the school was created in order to enable other religious libraries to benefit from all these changes.

47:22.268 --> 47:23.590
So the idea was that

47:24.211 --> 47:44.113
the library school should be used to teach new cataloguing rules, new subject headings, new reorganisation of the collections, new library procedures.

47:44.133 --> 47:47.597
This is why it was created.

47:47.897 --> 47:51.501
I wonder if you can give Nick a

47:52.105 --> 47:58.170
It's not really a catalogue of what's taught, but... Oh, yes, yes, I can give you.

47:58.190 --> 47:58.991
Yes, of course.

47:59.331 --> 48:00.292
I'll go downstairs.

48:00.312 --> 48:04.256
I just keep checking how it's done.

48:04.276 --> 48:04.736
Yes.

48:06.938 --> 48:14.985
Even the way books are arranged in the stacks follows the criteria of the Irish Congress.

48:15.045 --> 48:16.246
They are classifications.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.068
We don't use classifications.

48:18.689 --> 48:20.290
We have subject headings.

48:20.573 --> 48:50.580
because most of our collection is in code stacks so you have to you have access through the district it's a distribution desk but of course so you don't need to classify to keep them classified but here in the reading room there are about 50 000 volumes in open stacks which is one of the largest collection in open stacks that is fair yes you have about three thousand four thousand catalogues library catalogues

48:50.948 --> 48:52.670
from all over the world.

48:53.552 --> 48:58.238
Of course, libraries which have something in common with this library.

48:58.639 --> 49:17.584
So, like the British Library, Oxford, Cambridge University, National Library, or from other places, maybe their manuscript catalogues or ancient books, ancient collections, antiquarian collections.

49:17.604 --> 49:19.487
And here we have, of course, Aristotle,

49:19.872 --> 49:38.929
The primary tools, the Bibliotech National, the British Library, the Library of Congress, the catalogue, the Deutsche Bibliothek, and these useful tools.

49:38.949 --> 49:39.670
And then we have a set of materials.

49:52.525 --> 50:00.460
Thank you.

50:06.025 --> 50:29.974
Library, library, dealing games.

50:29.954 --> 50:59.961
This is an off-to-water photograph.

51:00.869 --> 51:06.114
of which he orders in here.

51:06.234 --> 51:13.680
How do you want to ask him how to order for his photograph?

51:13.700 --> 51:16.022
Come abroad.

51:16.182 --> 51:17.664
Thank you.

51:17.744 --> 51:19.345
I forgot about that now.

51:19.365 --> 51:22.008
Excuse me.

51:22.028 --> 51:23.609
So come abroad.

51:24.149 --> 51:29.874
You can order the e-mail.

51:30.155 --> 51:30.555
Thanks.

51:30.957 --> 51:32.819
for an email.

51:33.480 --> 51:41.208
We're now implementing your web, so you can order the web.

51:44.512 --> 51:49.277
If you fill in form, if you do it manually, if you're reading it, you'll fill in form.

51:50.638 --> 51:54.923
And that there is...

51:55.882 --> 52:12.562
I'm going to print engravings, coin collection, museums, and various negatives, photocopies, microfilms, kodachromes, and ultraviolet things.

52:12.642 --> 52:17.468
Where is it?

52:18.207 --> 52:21.511
We don't do photocopies of manuscripts, of course.

52:21.531 --> 52:32.325
You can have a re-stamp, a re-paint of microfilm and paper, but not a photocopy of them, of course, or manuscript.

52:32.385 --> 52:33.807
And that doesn't work.

52:33.827 --> 52:34.107
Oh, yeah.

52:34.187 --> 52:46.543
You don't want it one time, let's see if I can get another one.

52:50.422 --> 52:52.104
It's called a cradle.

52:52.124 --> 52:53.425
It's on oil.

52:54.727 --> 53:15.389
So it's like, you know, a car is... When the book lies on it, it will then sort of balance itself.

53:15.770 --> 53:18.893
And there's a set of...

53:19.143 --> 53:32.850
special lenses and mirrors to reduce the consequences of the curving of the blade.

53:33.090 --> 53:35.194
You've seen the

53:35.410 --> 53:38.333
Norton facsimile of the Shakespeare folios.

53:38.493 --> 53:41.856
They use the Hingman collator, I guess, it's called.

53:42.216 --> 53:43.798
But you get those curves in the pages.

53:44.058 --> 53:44.378
Yes.

53:45.359 --> 53:47.461
You're able to eliminate those curves?

53:48.102 --> 53:49.423
You're trying.

53:49.443 --> 53:50.044
I'll show you.

53:50.064 --> 53:54.808
Okay.

53:54.828 --> 54:01.435
Standing pages, really.

54:02.356 --> 54:04.978
This is an example of the hand-break thing.

54:05.768 --> 54:08.231
We have lots of inventories.

54:10.373 --> 54:16.520
This is a closed collection called the Barberini Library.

54:16.760 --> 54:20.805
As you see, we have this is the Giana Library.

54:21.346 --> 54:29.455
Again, this is more modern because it's already sort of pre-formatted, but it's handwritten, as you see.

54:30.496 --> 54:34.020
Then we have the inventories.

54:37.493 --> 54:46.165
Yes, you can type written inventories and then printed catalogs.

54:46.185 --> 54:51.492
So printed catalogs can be available in various libraries, of course.

54:52.574 --> 54:58.402
Printed inventories and manuscript inventories are available here.

54:58.422 --> 55:06.994
So these were also treated as manuscript and scanned.

55:10.906 --> 55:20.896
Okay, here, if you look down for how we can do electronic restoration in this case.

55:21.977 --> 55:39.495
In the past, to prevent the decay of paper, the paper was included in two layers of plastic, and this has damaged the paper because

55:39.897 --> 56:09.448
it has favoured the ink that is from the outside and this is irreversible so one will not be able to go back to the previous position so this is one of the cases for the electronic restoration because you can

56:09.968 --> 56:15.734
You can find out the wavelength of this, and have it removed, and have it nice and clean.

56:16.375 --> 56:21.961
So in this case, the poppy is much more legible than the other ones.

56:23.282 --> 56:24.403
And more desirable, too.

56:24.824 --> 56:24.944
Yes.

56:24.964 --> 56:28.868
It's a case where you want to preserve it.

56:28.928 --> 56:29.849
That's exactly right.

56:29.869 --> 56:31.071
And you don't want to.

56:31.151 --> 56:38.018
You see, manuscripts are all in ghost acts, with the exception of these manuscripts, which indeed are manuscripts.

56:38.588 --> 56:45.897
And because of there being a reference material for the manuscript collection, they're also very heavily used.

56:46.618 --> 56:48.200
So they are in danger.

56:48.860 --> 56:54.187
Because other manuscripts are only accessed maybe once a year.

56:54.207 --> 56:54.968
And not all of them.

56:55.168 --> 56:56.249
Some of them are.

56:56.269 --> 56:59.073
But these are accessed once a day.

56:59.653 --> 57:01.776
So they are really worn.

57:02.657 --> 57:04.119
They're in real danger.

57:04.299 --> 57:07.583
So please, when this will be scanned,

57:08.018 --> 57:16.707
And this will not be available in the original version, but in its electronic reproduction.

57:16.727 --> 57:17.648
Inventory of?

57:18.189 --> 57:22.753
Of the Ottoboni, of the Ottoboni collection of Latin manuscripts.

57:23.414 --> 57:29.921
And here let me show you.

57:29.941 --> 57:32.203
Unfortunately, that's not the one.

57:32.572 --> 57:34.154
I'll show you.

57:34.594 --> 57:43.784
I'm afraid I'm just able to show you the thing because it's not working.

57:44.304 --> 57:46.366
Apparently they're doing something.

57:46.386 --> 57:48.148
There's a mess.

57:48.448 --> 57:56.056
I'll show you.

57:56.076 --> 58:01.262
Thank you.

58:01.282 --> 58:01.422
Thanks.

58:01.442 --> 58:02.443
Please blow the deck.

58:02.812 --> 58:04.754
You put his jackets on.

58:05.776 --> 58:08.039
It's really exciting.

58:08.059 --> 58:09.300
Yeah, it is exciting.

58:13.626 --> 58:15.228
This doesn't happen very often.

58:15.248 --> 58:21.395
No, I think I've only been in here when I went to the library school in about 20 years.

58:21.415 --> 58:23.298
I'd like to think how many years ago.

58:24.860 --> 58:29.005
Where did you...

58:29.221 --> 58:35.567
I studied to learn all these things about automation as well as the medieval world.

58:35.928 --> 58:42.114
University, here at the library, at the School of Library Science, various places, yes.

58:42.674 --> 58:44.696
And in England also?

58:44.716 --> 58:46.898
Yes, these are marked incunabula.

58:46.918 --> 58:48.560
Yes, these are the incunabula.

58:49.901 --> 58:55.046
And you have these.

58:55.066 --> 58:58.890
These are the incunabula, and there are connections, and I will show you

58:59.697 --> 59:04.264
This is the Aldine collection.

59:04.284 --> 59:12.616
We have a copy of every volume published, printed by the Aldine.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.058
You have every Aldine?

59:14.519 --> 59:14.820
Yes.

59:16.502 --> 59:18.225
How many are those?

59:19.667 --> 59:27.559
One, two, one.

59:27.579 --> 59:29.181
These two.

59:29.617 --> 59:31.119
There and there.

59:32.722 --> 59:35.786
Aldous invented the little book, the little octalium.

59:35.926 --> 59:37.749
They are 160 first type.

59:37.769 --> 59:50.989
165 seconds, 309, so it's 320, 600, I'll say about 750 altogether.

59:52.251 --> 59:57.058
Maybe more because it goes to this one, which I'm not.

59:58.051 --> 01:00:00.214
750 different titles?

01:00:00.234 --> 01:00:01.676
Different titles, yes.

01:00:02.356 --> 01:00:11.488
And this is the so-called La Colta Prima, which is the first collection of the library.

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:26.927
This was the, shall we say, the first collection of printed books around which the library, the Vatican Library was created.

01:00:27.312 --> 01:00:31.047
Yeah, so this is the heart of the collection.

01:00:31.067 --> 01:00:32.393
No flash in here as well?

01:00:32.413 --> 01:00:34.200
I can raise a flash in here.
