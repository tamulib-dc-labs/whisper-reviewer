WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:03.994
I'll just leave this here.

00:04.074 --> 00:05.155
Don't think anything of it.

00:05.235 --> 00:16.448
I know you've done a few books with Yale, but you fundamentally are working on the Benjamin Franklin project.

00:16.468 --> 00:22.174
Well, that's an overstatement in a way.

00:23.816 --> 00:31.405
I've been for a long time on the board, administrative board that oversees the

00:31.992 --> 00:33.073
Franklin papers.

00:33.294 --> 00:33.654
I see.

00:34.875 --> 00:40.122
And was, until last year, or this year, I guess, was chairman of the board.

00:40.142 --> 00:41.363
Board?

00:41.383 --> 00:42.164
Of that project.

00:42.224 --> 00:46.769
Only meets once a year to approve the budget.

00:46.789 --> 00:50.574
And it used to be sometimes they try to raise it.

00:50.594 --> 00:51.174
Right, right.

00:51.875 --> 00:57.662
Which has been a continual problem with all the founding fathers.

00:58.115 --> 01:01.119
That's another story I was thinking about.

01:01.139 --> 01:17.298
And I guess the idea that here we are in the 21st century, and I guess it's gratifying that there are presses that continue to be committed to these really big, ambitious publishing projects.

01:17.318 --> 01:21.042
And they are losers as far as the budget.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.107
They sell usually less than a thousand a year.

01:25.247 --> 01:27.430
Is that right?

01:27.899 --> 01:30.142
the volume that comes out that year.

01:31.204 --> 01:42.840
And it will have had a huge amount of money put into the opening of it to begin with and then to the manufacture of it by the press.

01:42.860 --> 01:49.009
So it is certainly a noble undertaking for the presses.

01:49.830 --> 01:55.678
I'm sure you could talk a little bit about your conviction that it is a worthwhile

01:56.452 --> 02:19.236
endeavor to continue to do in this age of electronic books, the fact that we should still continue to produce a printed book, as opposed to, say, out of the University of California, Berkeley, not meaning to jump on one institution, but where, let's say, the Mark Twain project is in particular jeopardy because there is a feeling that

02:19.705 --> 02:29.434
As you say, it's a loser financially on the one hand, and that there is a school of thought that perhaps it could be done better electronically.

02:30.755 --> 02:33.177
I don't necessarily subscribe to that.

02:33.358 --> 02:36.761
I don't see why we can't do both.

02:36.781 --> 02:47.991
Nor do I, and it's an interesting fact that electronic publication has been found to increase the sales.

02:48.460 --> 02:48.800
Really?

02:48.901 --> 02:49.842
Of books.

02:52.144 --> 02:54.688
Oxford has experienced that.

02:56.270 --> 03:06.922
Yale may have, that when a book is published electronically, it does not decrease the sale of the hard copies.

03:07.743 --> 03:12.689
In a way, the question is, well, why spend the money?

03:12.730 --> 03:13.450
Why do it?

03:14.231 --> 03:17.235
It's just a lot more pleasurable.

03:18.295 --> 03:19.957
to hard copy.

03:20.017 --> 03:26.286
It's perhaps, I don't know, I suppose it varies.

03:27.929 --> 03:41.669
I have a CD-ROM of all the Franklin papers published and it was made by the Packard Humanities Institute.

03:43.852 --> 03:47.577
And it's much easier to use if you're looking for something.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.952
It isn't easier to use if you're sitting down to read the volumes.

03:52.012 --> 03:55.517
But if you're looking for something in a volume, you can find it.

03:55.537 --> 03:58.160
It's a lot easier on the screen.

03:58.220 --> 03:58.561
Of course.

03:58.581 --> 04:02.386
You have a database and you do a keyword search.

04:02.466 --> 04:07.192
I'm now doing a reader of the Franklin Papers.

04:07.893 --> 04:09.675
I'm going to publish next year.

04:09.715 --> 04:16.143
And for that purpose, it's much easier.

04:16.183 --> 04:17.665
I've cut the...

04:18.151 --> 04:27.904
the CD-ROM onto the hard drive of the computer, and I simply print out the .

04:27.924 --> 04:28.625
Isn't that wonderful?

04:29.186 --> 04:29.807
Yeah, it's fabulous.

04:29.827 --> 04:30.528
Yeah, it is.

04:30.588 --> 04:31.189
It's fabulous.

04:31.890 --> 04:38.539
The book I just finished and sent off to Harper's, which is publishing this fall, I had a quote from Edward Gibbon.

04:38.789 --> 04:41.353
And, of course, I found the quote.

04:41.393 --> 04:44.599
And as often happens with quotes, they never give you the source.

04:44.619 --> 04:45.801
They never give you the provenance.

04:46.081 --> 04:50.368
And I refused to use any quote unless I could nail down exactly where it's from.

04:50.408 --> 04:53.754
So I called up a full text of The Decline and Fall.

04:54.635 --> 04:59.544
I thought it might be in his memoir, which is what I've been quoting at length, is where he talks about his full text.

04:59.564 --> 05:00.966
How did you get the full text, anyway?

05:01.638 --> 05:02.979
Well, it's right online.

05:03.020 --> 05:07.564
You just go to Gutenberg, it's called the Gutenberg Project, and you can get a full text.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.828
It's like, you know, it's the whole thing.

05:11.208 --> 05:19.457
So you call up the full text, and then you just type in, you know, a few key words of that quote, and it just pops.

05:19.558 --> 05:24.383
It was in his preface to volume four of his six-volume history.

05:24.683 --> 05:30.970
You know, many thousands of words into it, which I would have found at some point, and I'd been flipping through it, but I had no clue.

05:31.118 --> 05:38.451
And, you know, I had it within seconds, and then, of course, I could cite it properly and make sure I had it quoted properly, too.

05:38.512 --> 05:54.561
Well, the Packard Humanities Institute, which put all the Franklin papers, published and unpublished, onto the CDM, is also supporting the other founding fathers papers.

05:55.334 --> 05:59.218
A lot of people think that books are still worthwhile.

05:59.238 --> 05:59.678
That's right.

05:59.698 --> 06:03.201
Well, of course, a lot of it depends on, is it NEH funding?

06:03.221 --> 06:04.082
Yeah, it does.

06:04.202 --> 06:15.793
And if they decide that they are going to pull the plot, then an institution like Yale is going to have to decide whether or not they want to fund it or they can get the funding from another source.

06:15.813 --> 06:16.073
That's right.

06:16.093 --> 06:19.396
So that must, I would imagine, that's a continuing concern.

06:19.536 --> 06:20.918
It's a big problem.

06:21.758 --> 06:23.620
If I interrupted you, it's okay.

06:24.089 --> 06:26.111
But you were going to say something, I'm sorry.

06:26.191 --> 06:27.072
Can't think quite.

06:27.112 --> 06:31.337
Well, so you, God knows how many books you've written.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.338
Several dozen.

06:32.858 --> 06:34.140
No, no.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.381
Twelve or fifteen.

06:35.401 --> 06:36.242
Twelve or fifteen.

06:36.302 --> 06:41.748
I did a search of some of them, and so many of them are almost iconic.

06:41.768 --> 06:46.353
And they're really published largely with the trade, I guess.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.094
Yeah.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.097
I've published two books with the press.

06:50.819 --> 07:10.247
The first one was The Life of Ezra Stiles, one of the General Puritan, which I gave to the Yale Press, largely because Ezra Stiles was the president of Yale, and thought that they would have a larger market for us.

07:11.428 --> 07:19.780
I spent ten years in major... I've written three or four books in which I spent up to ten years in

07:20.148 --> 07:29.497
I was wrong, whether I was wrong about the Yale Press or just plain wrong, I don't know.

07:30.158 --> 07:43.471
The book was published in 1963, I think, and since then it has sold maybe 3,000 copies.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.455
Are you happy you did it?

07:47.890 --> 07:49.872
Yeah, it's one of the best books they ever wrote.

07:49.892 --> 07:51.233
But it's not sales than that.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.896
It was intended—I learned something by it.

07:53.916 --> 08:00.082
It was intended—Visner Stiles had his finger into everything intellectually.

08:00.162 --> 08:09.151
It was written as an intellectual history of 18th century knowledge, run from Perry Miller's.

08:09.831 --> 08:10.572
Yes.

08:10.592 --> 08:11.913
Really?

08:12.134 --> 08:17.779
But biographies of minor figures, number one.

08:18.232 --> 08:34.950
do not sell, and number two are not a good way to introduce people to a larger subject, which they are maybe a very good way of getting it, but that's not the way people see them.

08:36.191 --> 08:44.340
Because I was about two years into it when the Adams papers were opened up.

08:44.675 --> 08:50.270
and the Massachusetts Historical Society engaged in this thing.

08:50.852 --> 08:54.702
And a life of John Adams would have.

08:55.154 --> 08:56.475
would have emerged from that.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.256
Sold a lot.

08:57.276 --> 08:59.178
That would have been— Look at David McCullough.

08:59.799 --> 09:03.923
No, I'm not David, but he does, right?

09:04.384 --> 09:11.972
But the point is, Adams had largely been forgotten, and he more or less— He certainly put him on the map.

09:11.992 --> 09:13.213
—put him back on the map.

09:14.314 --> 09:22.883
I have quite a profile of David in my new book coming out this fall, and also Robert Coles, who was a student of Perry Miller at Harvard.

09:23.453 --> 09:29.420
My new book is titled Every Book Its Reader, The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.142
It's about books that do things.

09:31.162 --> 09:38.130
I wouldn't presume to say they change the world, but they certainly have their impact and they make things happen.

09:39.532 --> 09:51.486
But I was really very interested to talk to Dr. Coles about his conviction that literature helps make better physicians and how he was so instrumental in bringing that particular expert.

09:52.023 --> 10:07.618
Anyway, so this was 1963, which means you would have started in about 1953, and did you think at the time that there would be an audience, a readership for this book?

10:08.172 --> 10:11.876
Because you said, you know, biographies of minor figures do not sell.

10:11.936 --> 10:33.758
Is this something that you now can say in retrospect, or is it a conviction that you... But the reason for my doing it was, I had just finished a book on the Stamp Act crisis, which I spent on an equal amount, and one of the interesting things I'd come across was a notebook on the Stamp Act crisis by Ezra Stiles.

10:34.193 --> 10:39.301
There were 20,000 other manuscripts in the library by Ezra Siles.

10:39.361 --> 10:46.132
I thought, hey, nobody had ever used that massive to get at 18th century New England history.

10:47.094 --> 10:49.057
And I thought it was a great opportunity, and it was.

10:50.940 --> 10:52.703
It did what I wanted it to do.

10:52.763 --> 10:59.273
People haven't used it for that, but no, I'm quite happy with it.

11:00.350 --> 11:05.037
Did you proceed with the expectation that it would be a Yale Press book?

11:05.358 --> 11:19.880
It was supposed to be a North Carolina Press, because that was subsidized to the tune of $500 by the Institute of Early American History, and their publisher was North Carolina.

11:21.302 --> 11:26.830
And so I got special permission to let the Yale Press

11:27.434 --> 11:30.417
because they wouldn't have a much better distribution.

11:30.938 --> 11:32.900
And plus the Yale Connection is good, too.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.082
Yeah.

11:34.302 --> 11:39.047
Well, they didn't, anyhow.

11:39.067 --> 11:42.571
It kind of says something for a university.

11:42.852 --> 11:51.562
I mean, I doubt if you would have undertaken this project if there wasn't a university press out there that you expected would be.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.305
That's an interesting question.

11:54.345 --> 11:56.968
Would you have written this book if you thought it would never get published?

11:57.421 --> 12:05.513
Yeah, I mean, I know for myself, because I make my living, you know, from writing, and I have to enter these projects with the expectation that I'll publish.

12:05.613 --> 12:10.680
I went to ask Perry Miller that question, and he said, yes, absolutely, and I said, I don't believe you.

12:13.224 --> 12:17.710
Not necessarily so, because that's, you know, who can predict.

12:17.730 --> 12:20.515
Not necessarily to have it, but to have it, not to have it published.

12:20.535 --> 12:21.416
But not to have it published.

12:21.756 --> 12:24.981
I don't think I, it would lose something.

12:25.552 --> 12:26.714
in your drive to do it.

12:26.754 --> 12:27.354
I think so.

12:29.217 --> 12:51.947
But the immediate interest was the opportunity that this mass of manuscripts offered me to say something about New England intellectual history that I wouldn't have been able to say and that nobody else had said, because there must be something in Holland's papers.

12:52.450 --> 12:57.796
They're all correspondence for the most part, as well as essays by himself.

12:57.816 --> 13:02.021
Let me ask you a question, because you've written for both the trade and for University Press.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.504
Do you write differently when you're writing for University Press?

13:05.365 --> 13:05.485
No.

13:05.505 --> 13:05.826
You don't.

13:05.906 --> 13:09.090
I try to write as always for anybody.

13:09.150 --> 13:12.834
We are celebrated as a writer of narrative.

13:12.914 --> 13:20.483
The point I always made to my graduate students was that the audience you should

13:20.918 --> 13:28.431
anticipate and expect and have in mind is someone who is more intelligent than you are.

13:28.952 --> 13:32.178
So you never write down anybody.

13:32.198 --> 13:33.601
You never condescend.

13:33.721 --> 13:43.298
You assume that he's a man from Mars who's got this super intelligence and he doesn't know one damn thing about the Earth.

13:43.548 --> 13:46.753
And your job is not only to teach him, but to entertain him, perhaps.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.176
Keep him interested, I suppose.

13:49.277 --> 13:50.478
Well, I never thought of that.

13:50.498 --> 13:57.168
I thought in terms of always writing intelligibly.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.692
Intelligibly to anyone.

13:59.712 --> 14:00.213
Excessively.

14:00.233 --> 14:05.842
Give everybody, anyone, all the information he needs to understand what you're saying.

14:06.623 --> 14:12.171
You should have something to say, otherwise you shouldn't be writing.

14:12.252 --> 14:20.260
But you should not assume that he knows that Columbus discovered America.

14:22.702 --> 14:25.705
You should not assume that he knows that Georgia-Washington did so many.

14:27.527 --> 14:37.517
And you don't need to... You can't say it so that you sound like teacher talking to put it in there somehow or other.

14:37.733 --> 14:38.414
work it in.

14:38.494 --> 14:56.855
You know, George Washington during his first term as our nation's first president is one way to kind of fold it into the narrative without any differently for any at all.

14:58.497 --> 15:02.121
You know, one of the reps that I have always had

15:03.181 --> 15:10.893
one of the criticisms that I have had, the university presses as a generic species, that I've always thought Yale has been wonderful.

15:11.574 --> 15:22.411
But that in general, the books have so much promise when you see the title and you see the subject, but then you get into it and it's written for colleagues.

15:22.591 --> 15:26.978
The language is so inaccessible, filled with jargon and

15:27.160 --> 15:30.665
And all of the joy and the excitement of the story seems to be lost.

15:30.705 --> 15:32.067
I'm sorry if that's the case.

15:32.087 --> 15:33.770
I mean, there's no need for it to be.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.452
Not for historians, any.

15:35.973 --> 15:37.054
Not for historical works.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.096
Maybe for scientists.

15:40.319 --> 15:44.545
Maybe for scientists, but that kind of science should be in scientific journals.

15:45.807 --> 15:56.222
Another thing that university presses, something that university presses have had going for it since the

15:57.552 --> 16:02.097
Oh, early 20th century, is design.

16:02.818 --> 16:04.320
Princeton and Yale.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.042
Princeton had P.J.

16:06.062 --> 16:13.972
Conkright, and Yale had Carl Rollins, and that was in the early part of the 20th century.

16:14.813 --> 16:21.421
We're ace designers, so Princeton and Yale books were both very good to look at.

16:22.642 --> 16:25.686
And to me, design is a very important thing in the book.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.405
did a very good job with the book on Benjamin Franklin.

16:31.465 --> 16:41.939
I published the old Vedovitz, was a designer, and she did a part of the success of that book, which is sold more than any other book ever.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.820
And it's a Yale book?

16:43.141 --> 16:53.675
Well, sold more as a trade book than I've written a couple of books that have been used in teaching and still are 50 years old.

16:55.818 --> 16:56.078
But

16:56.632 --> 16:59.877
for a trade book, for a book in its initial year.

17:01.419 --> 17:07.047
This one sold well over 100,000 copies, anyhow.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.088
In hardcover?

17:08.108 --> 17:08.429
Yeah.

17:08.629 --> 17:08.970
Wow.

17:09.130 --> 17:14.818
And I attribute part of that to the design.

17:14.838 --> 17:15.138
Really?

17:15.178 --> 17:16.400
And that's a Yale book?

17:16.681 --> 17:17.482
It's a Yale book.

17:17.542 --> 17:18.603
100,000 copies?

17:19.404 --> 17:20.125
Yeah, I think so.

17:20.206 --> 17:24.732
Is that close to being—do you think that's one of the top Yale's best sells?

17:25.623 --> 17:36.759
There's one to which it's not even close, and it's the only one that fed the press financially for a long time.

17:36.799 --> 17:38.080
That's The Lonely Crowd.

17:39.062 --> 17:41.325
It was back around 1923 or 1930s.

17:41.345 --> 17:42.747
I don't know it.

17:42.967 --> 17:43.548
You don't know it?

17:43.648 --> 17:43.848
No.

17:44.169 --> 17:54.263
I'm surprised because it was the big book of the...

17:54.597 --> 17:55.558
1940s, 50s.

17:55.839 --> 18:05.211
I just read Malcolm Cowley's book from 1939, The Books That Shaped Our Thought, you know, and that one's not in there.

18:06.032 --> 18:13.521
And they were specifically looking at books of the 20th century, too, you know.

18:14.242 --> 18:18.047
I'm sure that's still more than a million times.

18:18.648 --> 18:21.972
What is there about it that makes it so resonant?

18:25.276 --> 18:26.457
words that you use.

18:27.038 --> 18:31.464
It divides people into different categories.

18:31.484 --> 18:32.445
Social?

18:32.485 --> 18:34.347
Yeah, it's entirely sociology.

18:35.649 --> 18:41.376
David Reisman and, I think, maybe Reisman and Nathan, Nathan Glazer may have been.

18:41.396 --> 18:42.217
Okay.

18:42.457 --> 18:45.741
So, basically, you think is more in the academic field?

18:45.962 --> 18:47.784
No, no, it wasn't popular.

18:47.924 --> 18:48.745
It's a popular book?

18:48.785 --> 18:49.386
Yeah, it was.

18:49.566 --> 18:54.372
It was academic, too, but it, as a

18:54.757 --> 19:01.306
Some people are inner-directed, some people are other-directed.

19:02.187 --> 19:03.649
Oh, okay, sure, absolutely.

19:03.669 --> 19:07.955
And other people are, I think I call them tradition-directed or something like that.

19:09.237 --> 19:17.167
But whether people are inner-directed or other-directed was a big topic of conversation for a decade.

19:18.048 --> 19:18.629
Wow.

19:18.649 --> 19:22.975
So your best-selling book, personally, is the Benjamin Franklin book.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.316
But it's a Yale book.

19:24.577 --> 19:26.359
It's a Yale book, that's right.

19:26.379 --> 19:29.965
As opposed to... Because Dorton is my usual publisher.

19:29.985 --> 19:31.287
Which is a wonderful publisher.

19:31.307 --> 19:31.647
It is.

19:31.808 --> 19:32.228
I love that.

19:32.248 --> 19:32.789
Fabulous.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.593
The last great independent publisher.

19:35.613 --> 19:39.159
The last great independent.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.821
And it's a great press to work.

19:40.901 --> 19:42.363
I've never worked for a better press.

19:43.125 --> 19:49.714
I think, in general, university presses are harder to work for than commercials.

19:49.734 --> 19:50.476
I miss out.

19:50.496 --> 19:52.759
They told me the copy deadline on this is...

19:53.228 --> 19:54.789
next year, which is fine.

19:54.809 --> 19:55.390
I could do this.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.772
I'm a quick writer.

19:57.812 --> 20:00.955
But then they said, publication is 2008.

20:01.035 --> 20:02.416
I said, 2008?

20:02.516 --> 20:03.797
I said, two years?

20:03.897 --> 20:07.840
I mean, I turn books around in eight, nine months.

20:08.381 --> 20:08.961
It's amazing.

20:09.001 --> 20:13.826
I mean, a year ago at this time, I was just doing, I was still doing interviews for my book.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.388
Not only is it written, it's in the catalog for fall.

20:16.448 --> 20:22.493
And it's, you know, I've already signed off on the dust jacket, for instance.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.686
That's characteristic.

20:23.707 --> 20:28.593
I mean, it's less so as they become more ambitious.

20:29.334 --> 20:32.158
See, John Rydon as director of the press.

20:32.178 --> 20:34.001
And I'm seeing him this afternoon, by the way.

20:34.402 --> 20:36.925
Oh, he succeeded Chester Kerr.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.593
And he more than doubled the number of books published every year.

20:43.374 --> 20:46.759
He helped press into the...

20:47.026 --> 20:50.429
Well, they operated in the black last year.

20:50.789 --> 20:54.313
Did they?

20:54.453 --> 20:58.176
I'm sure, but, you know, they're very pleased to point out.

20:58.256 --> 21:01.279
I mean, I was even able to negotiate a little bit with them on the contract.

21:01.299 --> 21:12.989
You know, they offered a number, and I said, well, look, I realize you can't give me what I get from Hogwarts on the one hand, but on the other hand, you have to make it reasonably worth money.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.852
And so, you know, they were willing to...

21:16.304 --> 21:18.167
It's interesting to go out with.

21:18.207 --> 21:21.813
I don't see how they think they're going to sell a history of the old practice.

21:21.833 --> 21:22.394
Yeah, they don't.

21:23.997 --> 21:29.726
But I maintain with a bit of arrogance that I have a pretty good following of my own, you know.

21:29.786 --> 21:30.548
You have a good enough book.

21:30.628 --> 21:31.890
It'll sell it because of your name.

21:31.930 --> 21:35.195
My people will buy... Your name will sell it.

21:35.296 --> 21:39.763
Well, whenever it sells, but it'll sell more than... I told them, you know...

21:41.127 --> 21:42.389
They're expecting 1,000 copies.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.634
I said, I'm not going to waste my time on 1,000.

21:45.754 --> 21:47.477
That's my attitude going on.

21:47.497 --> 21:48.879
Maybe they're right.

21:48.899 --> 21:50.722
But I expect to tell stories.

21:51.403 --> 21:53.867
And I'm not going to do a very boring history of the press.

21:54.107 --> 21:56.671
How can you do 100 years anyway in 50,000 words?

21:57.292 --> 22:03.242
I want to have profiles of people such as yourself and talk about your experiences.

22:03.322 --> 22:08.029
And you've given me some really wonderful insights here today.

22:08.330 --> 22:13.939
Do you find it interesting that the press is operating in the black, for instance?

22:13.959 --> 22:15.221
I think that's good, yeah.

22:15.923 --> 22:33.612
Because they're still doing what is their mission, to publish things that trade presses will not publish, but that need to be available to scholars and need to express the work

22:35.026 --> 22:38.410
of scholars that would not otherwise be exposed.

22:41.334 --> 22:46.882
I mean, I see that Einstein's theory of relativity has just been regretted.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.464
That's interesting.

22:48.484 --> 22:49.966
How many people read it the first time?

22:51.167 --> 22:55.773
It's one of these books that's respected but never read, you know.

22:55.793 --> 22:56.254
Right.

22:56.274 --> 22:57.335
How many people read it?

22:57.356 --> 22:58.898
But changed the world.

22:59.138 --> 23:00.780
But changed the world, exactly.

23:01.148 --> 23:04.173
Owen Gingrich did a book, the book that nobody read.

23:04.313 --> 23:05.395
It's about Copernicus.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.979
That was an ironic title.

23:08.019 --> 23:21.760
He spent 20 years traveling the world trying to study, doing actually a census of Copernicus, and trying to see what annotations might have been every first and second edition printing.

23:22.581 --> 23:23.402
Did people read it?

23:23.542 --> 23:25.405
What could you find out from this?

23:25.726 --> 23:27.128
It's a pretty interesting book.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.772
He published a book on it last year.

23:30.359 --> 23:40.195
But again, one of those books that changes the world in a very profound way, but not necessarily everybody reads it, I guess.

23:40.716 --> 23:42.759
They deserve to be published.

23:43.541 --> 23:45.704
And that's the mission of a university press.

23:46.005 --> 23:54.679
To state it once more, the mission of the university press, as you say, is to publish things that need to be available to scholars and not necessarily would be published by...

23:55.655 --> 23:58.058
Anyone driven by profit.

23:58.678 --> 24:00.901
Cop or First Rouse.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.644
Norton probably would take a whack at us.

24:04.045 --> 24:05.767
They might, but they're in business.

24:06.047 --> 24:06.648
They're in business.

24:08.149 --> 24:11.353
But if you've got a Patrick O'Brien over here.

24:12.394 --> 24:14.897
Yeah, they do Patrick O'Brien.

24:14.917 --> 24:15.938
They do Patrick O'Brien.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.703
That kind of gives you the wherewithal to go out and do it.

24:19.843 --> 24:21.905
And they do a lot of titles too, Norton.

24:22.306 --> 24:23.127
They're very impressive.

24:23.147 --> 24:25.189
I mean, Yale has about 300 books a year.

24:25.304 --> 24:26.385
It's astonishing.

24:27.066 --> 24:34.214
And what I didn't know is that the press had started, even though it was called Yale University Press, it really wasn't part of the university.

24:34.275 --> 24:36.978
It was a private league.

24:37.058 --> 24:41.323
It became a part of the university for tax purposes, I think.

24:41.783 --> 24:42.164
Really?

24:42.184 --> 24:46.249
Back in 1950.

24:46.269 --> 24:53.337
Don't quote me on that, because I'm not sure what the real history is, but you can get it.

24:54.228 --> 24:56.370
I remember it happening.

24:57.271 --> 25:00.514
I was at the time, I think, on the board of the Yale Press.

25:02.115 --> 25:06.759
So when you were on the board, what kinds of things did you drive the agenda, so to speak?

25:10.063 --> 25:12.345
No, we didn't drive the agenda.

25:12.465 --> 25:23.695
The board is a kind of filter, not quite a rubber stamp, but a filter for folks that are respectable.

25:24.620 --> 25:42.324
But the director of the press is the person who redetermines the sort of direction of the publication of the thing gets accepted and what doesn't.

25:42.344 --> 25:52.618
I think that, in general, a university press should generally, and this is assuming there's a lot of latitude, but try and in some way

25:53.307 --> 25:55.911
follow the curriculum of the university.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.253
And I've never heard this.

25:57.373 --> 26:06.006
No, and they don't, in general, favor faculty authors.

26:06.026 --> 26:09.912
They try to be national.

26:09.932 --> 26:12.215
At least Yale Press always has.

26:12.235 --> 26:13.818
I think the Harvard Press.

26:13.838 --> 26:21.289
You'll find a lot of the academic books published by the Yale Press are not by Yale faculty.

26:23.463 --> 26:24.504
And you think that's good.

26:25.185 --> 26:25.405
Yeah.

26:25.445 --> 26:26.366
I think it's good.

26:26.386 --> 26:27.828
Yeah, it makes them independent.

26:28.869 --> 26:30.150
They want to be independent.

26:30.171 --> 26:44.647
They don't want to feel obliged to take a bad book by a Yale faculty member or whatever, a book that has no, not even large enough on audience.

26:44.827 --> 26:45.808
Audience is important.

26:46.362 --> 26:49.885
Even if it's only 1,000 copies or 2,000 copies?

26:49.925 --> 26:54.089
It has to be important, yeah, even if it's only 1,000 copies.

26:55.150 --> 26:57.813
It'll be a book at least that libraries are going to need.

27:00.315 --> 27:03.778
You did that, you've done two books, I think you said, for you.

27:03.798 --> 27:06.000
You did The Stiles Book and The Franklin Book.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.924
And The Franklin Book is your personal bestseller?

27:10.024 --> 27:10.224
Yeah.

27:10.465 --> 27:11.385
Did that surprise you?

27:13.868 --> 27:14.108
Uh...

27:15.877 --> 27:28.433
Not so much because founding fathers were in Vogue, and Joe Ellis reminded me that he started the Vogue school as it is.

27:29.154 --> 27:31.778
Also a Yale alum too, isn't he?

27:31.798 --> 27:32.559
I guess he is.

27:33.160 --> 27:33.360
Yeah.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.123
He was just alum, a Yale graduate.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.748
Well, he's made a pretty good impact on his own.

27:40.069 --> 27:40.850
Yes, he has.

27:43.273 --> 27:45.816
But I think biography in general is

27:46.218 --> 27:54.911
I think every writer of nonfiction is really looking for that wonderful biography that hasn't been done.

27:55.792 --> 28:03.965
But the one-volume biographies, the multi-volume biographies, which were very 19, what, 15?

28:03.985 --> 28:08.892
Yeah, well, the Dumas Malone, six volumes of Jefferson, for instance.

28:09.092 --> 28:15.482
Jefferson and Madison, my friend of mine.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.775
So what?

28:19.477 --> 28:24.942
They're good, too.

28:24.962 --> 28:26.163
And he was a journalist.

28:26.183 --> 28:27.024
Really?

28:29.647 --> 28:30.127
No kidding.

28:31.409 --> 28:37.355
Some of the best historical works have been written by people.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.437
Could you throw a few names at me?

28:40.198 --> 28:45.503
Claude Bowers was in the beginning of this century.

28:46.428 --> 29:05.888
Albert Beveridge, Life of John Marshall in four volumes, was the sort of work on John Marshall, at least until he took a history course and a book on Pearl Harbor for the Rand Corporation.

29:06.608 --> 29:10.052
The Beveridge Prize, which is the biggest prize.

29:10.172 --> 29:12.534
It's named after Albert Beveridge.

29:13.375 --> 29:16.198
It's the most prestigious historical prize.

29:16.364 --> 29:17.726
Mm-hmm.

29:17.746 --> 29:18.467
Prize for her.

29:19.127 --> 29:20.950
And what was the title of her book?

29:20.970 --> 29:23.153
Uh, Pearl Harbor Warning and Decision.

29:25.195 --> 29:27.218
She published approximately.

29:27.478 --> 29:27.798
Oh, gosh.

29:28.139 --> 29:28.800
At Jenton.

29:28.820 --> 29:29.460
This is approximately.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.085
Sixties, I think.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.508
It was Wohlstetter, Roberta Wohlstetter.

29:36.770 --> 29:37.931
What's the name?

29:38.111 --> 29:41.055
W-O-H-L-S-T-E-T-T-E-R.

29:41.778 --> 29:43.159
She was in a family then, doesn't it?

29:43.920 --> 29:45.462
Well, she's not a historian.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.684
She didn't continue to be a historian.

29:48.125 --> 29:50.287
She was in a house kind of a project.

29:50.848 --> 29:51.689
Yeah.

29:51.709 --> 29:55.833
And published by the Stanford University Press.

29:56.554 --> 29:57.455
Isn't that great?

29:57.695 --> 29:59.016
That's a great story.

30:00.558 --> 30:05.283
It was published the same year my book on Ezra Stiles was published.

30:06.384 --> 30:10.228
My book on Stiles won the Beverage Prize, but I won dead.

30:10.569 --> 30:11.650
That's great.

30:12.338 --> 30:14.841
Teaching and writing, have you always considered them?

30:16.543 --> 30:18.025
Yeah.

30:18.045 --> 30:19.447
Though I don't miss the teaching.

30:20.168 --> 30:21.790
I wasn't teaching when I wrote the Franklin.

30:22.131 --> 30:33.085
But I used to try out ideas in teaching for chapters of books and lectures.

30:33.105 --> 30:34.046
With the students?

30:34.066 --> 30:34.206
Mm-hmm.

30:34.747 --> 30:35.948
If it works for me, yeah.

30:35.968 --> 30:39.493
If it puts the students to sleep, there's something wrong with it.

30:41.026 --> 30:47.953
But you apparently worked great, did a lot of work, you said 10 years on these books.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.415
Yeah.

30:50.895 --> 30:54.619
I don't know why, just doing research.

30:54.639 --> 30:56.981
And writing, apparently narrative.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.083
I do a lot of different drafts.

30:59.163 --> 31:01.486
And you're looking for the elements of story, I guess.

31:02.026 --> 31:06.350
I don't know.

31:06.390 --> 31:09.193
I have a hard time judging my own work.

31:10.034 --> 31:23.288
They've both been willing to read the thing as though they knew nothing about their PhD in history, but I feel it's 19th century history.

31:23.948 --> 31:28.933
Straighter criticism for, you know, criticism.

31:29.474 --> 31:30.235
And I love that.

31:30.815 --> 31:32.277
Yeah.

31:32.297 --> 31:36.501
To read it as though they were a person in the North.

31:36.521 --> 31:39.484
I had two people read this book, which

31:39.886 --> 31:46.159
and manuscript, who I say is my reader of first resort, as you do.

31:46.499 --> 31:47.682
I always go to her first.

31:47.702 --> 31:50.929
But she's involved in the process, so she knows what it's about.

31:50.989 --> 31:54.115
But for this book, I found two gentlemen

31:54.905 --> 32:06.584
who I would describe as common readers in the Samuel Judson, Virginia Woolf mold, the paradigm, where they're bright, they read books, but they don't know a blessed thing about my subjects.

32:06.604 --> 32:07.205
That's what you want.

32:07.225 --> 32:08.547
And just exactly what you're saying.

32:08.668 --> 32:12.294
And I got some of the best trincisms.

32:13.536 --> 32:14.938
What's this?

32:15.121 --> 32:25.673
I was a ship designer, a ship architect from London who I still haven't met, but who had written me on my last couple of books with very perceptive observations of my books.

32:26.134 --> 32:28.416
And I finally said, you know, his name is Dimitri Manthos.

32:28.436 --> 32:30.138
I said, Dimitri, I still haven't met.

32:30.779 --> 32:33.202
It's just been a correspondence with email and stuff.

32:33.642 --> 32:34.523
And he's retired.

32:34.543 --> 32:36.025
He's an emeritus from someplace.

32:36.105 --> 32:40.630
And I said, you know, your criticisms are so good.

32:40.650 --> 32:41.972
How about reading the next book?

32:42.087 --> 32:48.416
When you can really do something, when you can really help me, you know, as opposed to coming to me after the fact and saying, gee, I wish you'd have done this or done that.

32:48.436 --> 32:52.060
And he really had some wonderful, wonderful perceptions.

32:52.381 --> 32:54.664
But that's exactly what you're looking for, I think.

32:54.684 --> 32:56.446
That guy says, what the heck are you talking about here?

32:56.526 --> 32:56.947
What is this?

32:57.408 --> 33:01.834
I'm assuming that they... I had a thing I wrote on the student, graduate student's papers.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.158
What at?

33:05.238 --> 33:07.681
W-H-A-D-D-A-T question.

33:07.702 --> 33:09.264
That's what I thought, yeah.

33:09.284 --> 33:10.305
Excellent, wonderful.

33:10.808 --> 33:13.017
I don't really mean to take up too much of your time, sir.

33:13.118 --> 33:17.636
I really just wanted to touch base and to get some perceptions.

33:17.757 --> 33:20.548
And if there's anything that you really thought...

33:21.001 --> 33:23.585
important to share with me about the press.

33:24.887 --> 33:29.213
That might make a good sound bite, as they say, or certainly send me on a direction.

33:29.553 --> 33:37.104
If you were counseling someone who was embarking as I am on such a project, what is it that you'd like to know about?

33:37.705 --> 33:41.411
What is it that you'd like to see in a centennial history of a press?

33:41.451 --> 33:45.417
Something that has all of the earmarks of being a dull, boring kind of thing.

33:46.398 --> 33:49.202
But what is it as a publishing story, as a book story, as a

33:49.402 --> 33:58.473
There's a book about an enterprise, and maybe it's even an anachronism in this day and age where we are having so many different kinds of media.

34:03.079 --> 34:10.468
You told me not to be shy, you know, works at all, too.

34:10.909 --> 34:18.058
As with our trade house, the role of the director is the actress

34:18.308 --> 34:24.294
of the old press have been very different in conception of what they were doing.

34:24.755 --> 34:27.117
They left their mark, do you think?

34:28.038 --> 34:31.562
John Ryden has certainly left his mark.

34:33.304 --> 34:36.847
Chester Kerr was a totally different person.

34:37.988 --> 34:38.789
What a style.

34:42.013 --> 34:47.218
And so,

34:47.671 --> 34:54.882
Did he put people, intimidate them, or was it pretty much my way or the highway kind of an attitude?

34:56.365 --> 35:04.838
Well, he was so full of himself that, as I say, he did have style.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.464
He and Kingman Brewster were great friends.

35:09.187 --> 35:14.655
I mean, my style is something that you can't define.

35:15.396 --> 35:17.700
But I would be pleased to hear you say a little bit more about it.

35:17.780 --> 35:18.801
It's interesting to me.

35:19.222 --> 35:26.593
Trust me, I'm not here to jump on the press, but stuff like this is good.

35:26.613 --> 35:28.436
I think it's healthy.

35:28.456 --> 35:33.603
Chester regarded the process as personal domain, that's for sure.

35:34.485 --> 35:37.489
And maybe that's all right.

35:38.498 --> 35:44.444
but he tended to ride roughshod over other people.

35:45.985 --> 35:47.367
Who worked for him, or authors?

35:47.487 --> 35:48.107
Yeah.

35:49.409 --> 36:08.067
Well, the one example where I really crossed swords with him was the first editor of the Franklin papers was a re-ed teacher

36:08.333 --> 36:10.936
Professor of Colonial History here.

36:13.278 --> 36:15.260
I actually took his place.

36:17.823 --> 36:19.064
About when?

36:19.625 --> 36:19.905
About?

36:21.026 --> 36:24.770
In 1955, I took his place.

36:24.790 --> 36:26.031
There in the Franklin Papers.

36:27.433 --> 36:34.780
And did a very good job in the first, I think, on the board by the time he retired.

36:36.397 --> 36:37.038
Hi.

36:37.058 --> 36:37.438
Hi.

36:37.858 --> 36:38.639
Oh, Toby.

36:39.380 --> 36:39.620
Hey.

36:40.421 --> 36:40.621
Hi.

36:40.641 --> 36:42.383
Hey.

36:43.143 --> 36:43.624
Marie?

36:44.124 --> 36:44.464
Yes.

36:44.484 --> 36:44.725
Yo.

36:45.085 --> 36:46.166
Hi, Mr. Basmage.

36:46.787 --> 36:47.167
How are you?

36:47.227 --> 36:48.128
I'm Nick Basmage.

36:48.188 --> 36:49.829
How do you do?

36:49.849 --> 36:51.091
I'm sorry for bursting in.

36:51.311 --> 36:52.132
I had a problem.

36:52.152 --> 36:54.914
I thought I would be back in Dutch's room later.

36:55.174 --> 36:56.135
Oh, is that something?

36:56.255 --> 36:58.938
No, no, I'm just bringing up the bag.

36:59.338 --> 36:59.999
Okay, Toby.

37:00.019 --> 37:02.621
I think I'm going to put Toby away so he can.

37:02.701 --> 37:03.002
Toby.

37:03.022 --> 37:04.243
Yeah, we're going out the door.

37:04.683 --> 37:05.084
Toby.

37:05.544 --> 37:05.644
Toby.

37:06.282 --> 37:14.491
Come on, Toby, go.

37:14.511 --> 37:16.013
We were talking about Jeff.

37:16.093 --> 37:18.896
He did the first 15 volumes.

37:20.418 --> 37:25.263
The history department at that point needed that 18th century British.

37:25.844 --> 37:35.935
Bill Wilcox, who was teaching at the University of Michigan, would be a great friend for moving into the period when Franklin was in England, would be just an ideal choice.

37:36.758 --> 37:48.729
So I got the history department to hire Wilcox there, part-time, and to be editor of the Franklin Board, to hire him as editor of Franklin.

37:49.070 --> 37:53.814
I'm talking with Chester about this, and Chester regarded the Franklin papers as his project.

37:54.134 --> 37:54.895
He was there.

37:55.155 --> 38:05.365
And Bill issued himself be a member of this board, and Chester's hired him.

38:06.053 --> 38:14.300
And I said, Chester, that's exactly what's wrong with you and always has been.

38:15.421 --> 38:18.023
You think the people who work for you are hired hands.

38:18.424 --> 38:19.024
Forget it.

38:20.485 --> 38:23.028
I'm seeing to it that Bill is on that board.

38:24.068 --> 38:24.809
And he was.

38:24.829 --> 38:26.110
And I did.

38:26.270 --> 38:31.355
But, you know, in those days I had some muscle.

38:31.595 --> 38:35.318
But...

38:36.243 --> 38:44.550
That's the kind of thing in which I thrust swords with Winchester and other people.

38:45.471 --> 38:49.995
So I know you didn't quote that incident, but it's characteristic.

38:50.335 --> 38:57.581
But it's okay if I pursue the observation that he did have his own sense of style and propriety.

38:57.601 --> 39:00.844
And that he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.

39:02.025 --> 39:05.608
And if there's anything that I think is even slightly

39:06.837 --> 39:07.658
controversial.

39:07.798 --> 39:09.740
I'll go over it with you, if you'd like.

39:11.002 --> 39:14.306
I don't mean to embarrass anybody with anything.

39:14.326 --> 39:15.187
It's not the way I work.

39:18.050 --> 39:22.415
John Ryder was a much more approachable person.

39:22.436 --> 39:27.321
John Ryder seems to have come in from publishing, too.

39:27.622 --> 39:29.464
Oh, yeah.

39:29.584 --> 39:34.650
Which is a departure in its own way from publishing.

39:35.693 --> 39:37.115
being secretary.

39:37.155 --> 39:47.570
He was on the press in some capacity, and there was a big battle about who should be a successor.

39:47.931 --> 39:50.034
I can't remember the name of his predecessor.

39:50.054 --> 39:54.660
He was a...come from publishing, I think.

39:54.880 --> 39:58.826
Current John, the director, comes directly from trade publishing.

39:59.046 --> 40:00.148
That's right, yeah.

40:00.483 --> 40:06.253
He knows my editor very well at Harper's Enfield, by the name of Hugh Van Dusen, who's been there for a long time.

40:07.335 --> 40:11.983
He knows as many paid people in New York publishing as I do, or more, you know.

40:13.265 --> 40:22.141
And to give a direction to... I think these projects that they're doing now, these annals of communism and the China books, are fabulous!

40:22.221 --> 40:23.503
What wonderful!

40:24.074 --> 40:33.383
publishing projects, really grand publishing projects, that you're not going to find anyone but a university press doing.

40:33.524 --> 40:35.285
I think that's very important.

40:35.406 --> 40:36.326
And they're successful.

40:37.668 --> 40:38.629
So what could be better?

40:39.229 --> 40:42.092
And their art books, I think, are totally fabulous.

40:42.453 --> 40:45.456
And I think the finest art books, period.

40:45.656 --> 40:53.524
They've had along the most successful books they had in sales, I think.

40:54.078 --> 41:03.208
when Chester was director, were some quite popular and received.

41:04.429 --> 41:08.353
And the Yale Presses had a no-good design.

41:09.094 --> 41:11.957
Poland started it.

41:11.977 --> 41:19.004
Who the principal designer is now, but there were Benevitz who did the design for my Franklin book.

41:20.786 --> 41:21.807
Can you articulate

41:22.225 --> 41:25.388
why you believe that design is so important, particularly?

41:26.149 --> 41:30.454
Read a book in paperback.

41:30.654 --> 41:35.719
It's just a matter of having decent margins.

41:38.803 --> 41:40.565
The size of the type.

41:42.126 --> 41:47.532
And you might have illustrations that you would not necessarily have, probably wouldn't have, of the paperback.

41:47.592 --> 41:50.275
That isn't so important, I think, the illustrations.

41:50.390 --> 41:51.672
You think they're not as important?

41:51.692 --> 41:51.752
No.

41:53.133 --> 41:54.736
But design?

41:54.796 --> 42:03.547
The title page, design of the title page, the type, the typeface, the lettering.

42:03.647 --> 42:08.253
So you pretty much selected the fonts that were used for your books?

42:08.493 --> 42:15.402
I liked to have them consult me, which is something that Norton always did.

42:15.902 --> 42:18.726
Yeah, my publisher does the same.

42:20.157 --> 42:23.641
Yale Press never consulted me about the design of the Ezra Stiles.

42:25.864 --> 42:39.539
They designed it in regard, you know, many presses work a book as theirs once it's out of your hands, once they get the paper, and they take the bit in their teeth.

42:41.622 --> 42:49.911
In New York, it's a university press, emble along at a very slow pace, but with

42:51.022 --> 42:56.327
Last consultation with the author, and I've always said, Norton has been the best.

42:57.108 --> 42:57.708
They're wonderful.

42:59.570 --> 43:12.462
I went to a function that Norton had a year or so ago in New York for one of their authors, and they very nicely said to me, I write the kinds of books that they love to publish.

43:13.022 --> 43:18.227
And in fact, they have encouraged me to have my agent

43:18.916 --> 43:23.308
And I'm doing this book, by the way, and I think we're about done with it.

43:23.368 --> 43:26.577
I think an hour is plenty of time for it.

43:26.858 --> 43:28.903
I think an interview is a lot like a lecture.

43:29.646 --> 43:33.837
Over an hour, you tend to be covering the same material and...
