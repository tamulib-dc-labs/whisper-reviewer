00:02.798 --> 00:18.196
There's a book called Alive, about the guy who survived for 72 days, just sort of grabbing fish, and he had a spill that he kept hearing.

00:18.857 --> 00:32.333
And then there's a book called, a really horrifying book, which is called Albatross, by a woman who was on a delivery crew of a boat called the Trashman that found it off the Carolina Capes.

00:32.617 --> 00:35.760
And that is really a scary one.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.964
When you read these, you kind of store them, don't you, I guess?

00:40.805 --> 00:40.985
Sure.

00:42.026 --> 00:43.908
They show up in other ways, I would think.

00:44.509 --> 00:47.151
I store them, and I stand up for a couple of purposes.

00:47.171 --> 00:48.833
I mean, I always put myself out there.

00:49.774 --> 00:55.739
I mean, I always think of myself as being out there on the boat.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.162
I'm not writing much about the sea these days.

00:58.262 --> 00:59.383
I mean, I'm...

00:59.937 --> 01:04.598
None of my stories, well, except for one of the, I don't know whether you've read the new book.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.968
I have it, yeah, right here.

01:07.310 --> 01:09.660
One of those stories takes place on a boat.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.171
of sailing down off St.

01:12.191 --> 01:12.611
Lucia.

01:13.512 --> 01:17.076
But none of the others have much to do or anything to do with sailing.

01:17.116 --> 01:24.185
Of course that's sailing, but when you say I put myself out there, I wonder if that applies... No, I mean I imagine myself out on the boat.

01:24.205 --> 01:31.633
I understand that, but I wonder if just to expand that, you know, do you do that with all of these things?

01:31.734 --> 01:32.915
Well, sure I do.

01:32.975 --> 01:37.200
I mean, it's an appropriate metaphor because, of course,

01:37.585 --> 01:42.752
You know, I mean, when I was writing Out of Bridge Reach,

01:43.745 --> 01:50.735
I couldn't have identified more with the guy who was trying to... In fact, I even tried to bring him back alive.

01:50.995 --> 01:51.315
Did you?

01:52.557 --> 01:54.600
I figured out if there wasn't a way, I couldn't do it.

01:54.940 --> 02:09.921
I mean, you know, I identified with Strickland, who was trying to make a movie about it, and I identified with him because he was trying to do something special, something he was trying to extend, and so was I.

02:10.306 --> 02:12.850
Do you try to do that in general, do you think?

02:12.910 --> 02:14.933
Bring them back alive, so to speak?

02:16.855 --> 02:31.397
Do you look for the... It's funny, you know, the writer in California, what the heck's his name, Lenny Michaels.

02:32.939 --> 02:33.860
Leonard Michaels, yeah.

02:34.281 --> 02:40.009
Yeah, he took a quote from one of Lord Byron's diaries and he used it as a title.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.371
And the title is, I could have saved them.

02:42.811 --> 02:44.414
You know, I would have saved them if I could.

02:45.335 --> 02:49.701
And it was Byron at an execution in Rome.

02:50.602 --> 02:51.844
Come on.

02:51.864 --> 02:54.688
And he saw these guys being put to death.

02:54.768 --> 02:56.951
And he wrote, I guess it was a letter.

02:57.793 --> 03:01.558
And he said, of course, I could have saved them if I could.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.358
Typically Byronic, right?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.661
They probably forgot about it five minutes later, too.

03:06.701 --> 03:10.106
And Lenny Michaels used that as a title.

03:10.426 --> 03:14.913
But I think, you know, I would save them all if I could.

03:15.413 --> 03:16.195
I would have saved them.

03:16.715 --> 03:21.522
I have to tell you this, the novella here of the new collection is...

03:22.328 --> 03:26.152
Absolutely a powerful, powerful story.

03:28.115 --> 03:32.139
Now, this is almost something I think that could have even been a novel.

03:32.620 --> 03:43.813
Is that a fair... Yeah, I mean, it is a novella, and in a way, it's a stripped-down novel.

03:44.053 --> 03:44.674
It's a novel.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.957
I'm a stripper down.

03:48.037 --> 03:49.339
I really believe in economy.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.082
I think you don't use more words than you need.

03:52.568 --> 03:58.236
And, you know, I wasn't going to pan it out and make it longer.

03:58.276 --> 03:59.678
My impulse is the opposite.

04:00.199 --> 04:11.656
But, you know, I mean, I think it's right to call it a novella because, you know, it has the complication and the different point of view and so forth of a novel.

04:12.838 --> 04:17.645
And, you know, in a way, it cost me like a novel.

04:18.105 --> 04:18.987
Did it really?

04:19.007 --> 04:19.948
Yeah.

04:20.609 --> 04:21.951
Well, it was just...

04:22.623 --> 04:27.248
Oh, very, just very intense.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.530
I've been intensely involved with it.

04:30.831 --> 04:36.717
And, you know, a lot of the emotional energy that goes into writing a novel.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.980
I mean, it goes into a story, too, but I was less concerned in a way.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.543
I mean, a story is like a baseball pitch, you know.

04:43.223 --> 04:49.269
It breaks, and if everything goes right, the guy swings and flocks in the glove.

04:49.910 --> 04:51.111
It's one long motion.

04:52.171 --> 04:57.036
And this was not quite like that.

04:57.056 --> 05:00.579
This was not one long motion like a short story is.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.801
But, of course, it depends upon your point of view.

05:02.841 --> 05:04.543
If you're hitting, you whack it out of the park.

05:04.923 --> 05:09.348
Well, I always think of writing short stories as like pitching.

05:09.368 --> 05:09.648
Really?

05:10.469 --> 05:10.689
Yeah.

05:10.749 --> 05:10.969
Why?

05:12.551 --> 05:13.672
Because of the action.

05:13.692 --> 05:13.952
I don't know.

05:13.972 --> 05:17.976
The action just reminds me of, you know, the wind-up, you let it go.

05:18.698 --> 05:19.919
You know it's got to break.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.481
I mean, that's got to be the epiphany.

05:21.501 --> 05:25.305
There's got to be a break there, whatever you put on it.

05:26.447 --> 05:29.550
Whatever kind of English you put on it, that's got to happen.

05:30.791 --> 05:37.979
And it's got to get past the defenses of the reader in a way, in a positive way.

05:38.019 --> 05:42.985
It's a pretty interesting metaphor with baseball season starting in a couple of weeks.

05:43.218 --> 05:50.026
But, you know, Ted Williams always measured success as one, you know, hitting as one out of three, you know, and you're a great hitter, right?

05:50.526 --> 05:52.989
Well, I don't see myself as a hitter.

05:53.009 --> 05:54.411
I see myself as a pitcher.

05:54.431 --> 05:55.251
Yeah, that's interesting.

05:55.292 --> 06:05.143
I mean, I think that has a lot to... This particular novella, I have to say also, during what period did you write that?

06:05.183 --> 06:06.364
Is that something that took a long time?

06:06.384 --> 06:09.107
Over a period, I started it...

06:09.712 --> 06:13.718
And I got the character of Gray, oh, I don't know, a while back.

06:14.119 --> 06:15.821
I just didn't know it became of Gray.

06:15.861 --> 06:19.787
I knew that Gray got drunk and he got thrown out of the casino.

06:19.827 --> 06:26.737
And I was thinking of the old Frank Sinatra place on the north shore of Tahoe.

06:27.278 --> 06:27.979
The Calnaver.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.141
I guess we won't say that.

06:29.481 --> 06:32.045
Well, I'm not saying it, but I visualized it myself.

06:32.145 --> 06:35.430
The Calnaver is what it was called.

06:35.570 --> 06:36.712
Because it has windows.

06:36.912 --> 06:37.373
That's right.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.277
And you can see out of it, it has that western kind of thing.

06:40.397 --> 06:45.865
And, yeah, I was just, you know, I was shooting craps in the Kalanato.

06:45.926 --> 06:47.949
I was behaving myself perfectly well.

06:48.009 --> 06:48.770
I wasn't drunk.

06:48.970 --> 06:57.462
But I just thought it was one of the few places that had the old kind of mob tone to it a little bit, you know.

06:57.503 --> 07:01.188
I mean, everybody was perfectly, perfectly, perfectly okay.

07:01.528 --> 07:04.693
But it just had that kind of mobbed up.

07:05.264 --> 07:17.367
field a little bit of that left which the others don't have interestingly enough you know the new the uh the casino down in ledyard connecticut does have some windows in it

07:17.836 --> 07:29.852
Yeah, they went counter to the whole, not throughout the building, but in the original building, you can actually look up and see that it's daytime or nighttime, and you can see the woods, which is amazing, you know.

07:30.012 --> 07:32.054
Yeah, well, that is amazing.

07:32.074 --> 07:34.057
Yeah, and of course it's... Where you're going to be living.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.782
That's right.

07:37.882 --> 07:42.628
As a person who has occasionally shot Krebs, I have to say his philosophy there was totally...

07:43.975 --> 07:45.296
You don't say whatever.

07:45.316 --> 07:46.638
He must have lost everything, right?

07:47.038 --> 07:48.800
Yeah, well, he just got drunk.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.283
And they kind of, you know, kind of intimidated.

07:52.303 --> 07:54.706
You know, most fans, they want to keep the money on there.

07:54.726 --> 07:56.087
They want to keep the chips on the table.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.749
They don't want anybody picking up.

07:58.610 --> 08:02.494
So, you know, they started that on him, even though he was the only guy there at first.

08:02.514 --> 08:05.977
Well, he has some extraordinary runs of luck there, too.

08:06.017 --> 08:07.959
But anyway, that's quite irrelevant.

08:08.119 --> 08:11.002
But he is kind of shooting craps with his life, though, isn't he?

08:11.183 --> 08:11.383
Yeah.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.645
Yeah, he's...

08:13.928 --> 08:15.811
He's had it, you know.

08:16.111 --> 08:17.313
He's really had it.

08:19.536 --> 08:23.923
That's why he envies those fish.

08:23.943 --> 08:26.046
Why he tries to get the foam back.

08:26.146 --> 08:29.811
But he does say it at the end.

08:29.831 --> 08:33.256
I guess one reason he loved them is because they were going home to die.

08:34.098 --> 08:34.418
Yeah.

08:34.904 --> 08:36.806
They were going home and they were finished.

08:37.206 --> 08:40.950
They'd done their work, which he kind of does.

08:40.970 --> 08:42.571
Well, in fact, that's the quote, the fish.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.394
They had been finished and coming home.

08:46.795 --> 08:53.202
And, of course, you know, and you could see the setup there, but I have to say John's having the poems was, that's, it caught me.

08:53.642 --> 08:53.802
What?

08:54.343 --> 08:56.765
The fact that John had the poems.

08:58.086 --> 08:58.407
John?

08:58.527 --> 08:59.588
The Indian.

08:59.988 --> 09:00.969
Oh, that he had them.

09:00.989 --> 09:03.151
It's because she had them.

09:03.171 --> 09:04.152
It's because...

09:04.435 --> 09:09.660
Because Rowan had them.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.301
Rowan had the poem, she hid them.

09:11.321 --> 09:12.423
She hid them.

09:12.503 --> 09:14.424
She hid the stuff of her father's.

09:15.545 --> 09:17.147
A couple of his poems.

09:17.167 --> 09:20.810
And she had the... John found the poem because Rowan had hidden it.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.692
When he went through her thing.

09:23.053 --> 09:29.859
But the two poems too, the ones that... I have to say, you know, I'm trying to see these things, where they're going.

09:29.999 --> 09:33.322
And you got me there.

09:33.362 --> 09:34.223
It was really...

09:34.625 --> 09:37.569
Very, very, very powerful story.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.952
I'm working on a new book, I have to tell you.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.397
I had a book come out two years ago called A Gentle Madness.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.141
It was about bibliomania, 2,500 years.

09:46.181 --> 09:48.364
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

09:48.384 --> 09:49.586
It did pretty good, actually.

09:50.066 --> 09:54.893
It was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award last year, and it just went into its sixth printing.

09:54.973 --> 09:58.658
I mean, that's a topic a lot of people are...

09:59.127 --> 10:23.802
you know are are really interested in there are so many collectors yeah well i told the stories about it too which is you talk to larry mcmurtry larry didn't want uh we corresponded and he he opted out uh but i did use a quote from one of his novels as an epigraph uh zach jenks anything can be anywhere you know which i love there's a guy in detroit who is toby holtzman yeah that's the guy toby toby's in the book

10:24.237 --> 10:25.559
Yeah, I'm right.

10:25.639 --> 10:26.541
He belongs there.

10:26.621 --> 10:33.733
In fact, I talked to you about him, in fact, without mentioning you, but I mean, any number of authors hide from him when he shows up.

10:33.773 --> 10:35.957
Yeah, well, he seems demented.

10:35.977 --> 10:37.219
He seems utterly demented.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.645
But he's, you know, probably the major collector in America.

10:40.825 --> 10:47.115
Yeah, of Martin Furst, maybe, of what he collects, of the things that he collects.

10:47.156 --> 10:49.179
But the guy is dedicated to books, you see.

10:49.740 --> 10:49.840
Yeah.

10:49.820 --> 10:57.030
And this new book I'm working on is not about collecting, but it's about book culture on the eve of a new millennium.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.613
Right now.

10:58.853 --> 10:59.814
Yeah, like right now.

10:59.874 --> 11:04.261
But also I'm going to do a historical thing of libraries and libraries of the future.

11:05.162 --> 11:09.668
I just went to the... This is relevant to this, by the way, because I do want to ask you a couple of questions.

11:11.010 --> 11:16.678
Two weeks ago I was at the MIT Media Lab, you know, where they're developing the book of the future.

11:17.059 --> 11:17.920
And it's a book...

11:18.372 --> 11:19.417
And it looks like a book.

11:19.477 --> 11:20.321
It feels like a book.

11:20.401 --> 11:25.183
It has pages, and you can load each book with 3,000 different books.

11:26.087 --> 11:26.168
Wow.

11:26.188 --> 11:26.991
Can you hang on with me?

11:27.012 --> 11:27.353
Sure.

11:43.465 --> 11:43.825
Right.

11:44.026 --> 11:48.652
Yeah, well, Rowan here, her books are so important, and John keeps her books of her.

11:52.997 --> 11:54.920
Very, very interesting.

11:55.941 --> 12:00.146
I mean, there is a sense of books here as part of the lives of your characters.

12:00.847 --> 12:05.734
And you're basically a man who's been educated by his books, as my sense.

12:05.754 --> 12:07.816
Is that a fair observation?

12:07.856 --> 12:09.118
Yeah, that's certainly fair.

12:09.453 --> 12:18.267
I mean, I've read that you left high school and, you know, it's like George Bernard Shaw.

12:18.307 --> 12:20.771
I mean, his university was the British Library.

12:20.891 --> 12:24.316
Yeah, well, it was a similar situation.

12:24.336 --> 12:25.058
Is that a fact?

12:25.699 --> 12:25.859
Yeah.

12:26.059 --> 12:33.291
I mean, what I was good at in school, which was basically English and history and Latin, you know, I did fine.

12:33.391 --> 12:34.853
As a matter of fact, I got a scholarship.

12:35.356 --> 12:44.110
my junior year just before I quit from the state for a translation of the speech of Cicero's, which I did very freely.

12:44.270 --> 12:44.831
Come on.

12:45.272 --> 12:46.554
No, I'm not kidding.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.356
I mean, would I make it up?

12:49.498 --> 12:51.341
No, I'm not suggesting that you did.

12:51.702 --> 12:55.267
I'm just kind of shocked that you translated Cicero as a junior in high school.

12:55.388 --> 12:56.870
I was a senior.

12:56.930 --> 13:00.756
I quit my senior year.

13:01.124 --> 13:05.293
And, yeah, I mean, I made it a very free translation.

13:05.754 --> 13:17.580
And I guess the examiner just found it refreshing because it wasn't exactly word for word, but it was very much in the spirit of that particular speech against Caroline.

13:18.202 --> 13:43.737
and I got a I got a state scholarship for it but I never used the scholarship because I quit school. Do you find that reading has energized your creative spirit or obviously traveling and what you've experienced in life and the people that you've met in the experiences. Yeah but I'm always reading. I'm always reading. I mean certainly it has. I've never stopped reading. I've always got a book.

13:44.982 --> 13:48.867
And I read someplace that Beckett remains the main man.

13:48.887 --> 13:50.430
Is that wise?

13:50.570 --> 13:58.581
I don't know if this was Samuel Beckett as a person who was greatly influenced here.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.283
I don't know about influenced.

14:00.303 --> 14:05.911
I think Beckett was the greatest writer of the century in many ways.

14:06.692 --> 14:14.483
Beckett, of course, who wrote in French and writes that very spare kind of Irish English when he translates it,

14:15.155 --> 14:18.039
It's so Irish.

14:18.119 --> 14:21.884
It has that touch of Irishness to it, I've always thought.

14:22.685 --> 14:28.132
It has a kind of funny little Irish irony that isn't the way I write.

14:28.252 --> 14:35.442
If you take a book like Malloy, that's nothing like what I do.

14:35.962 --> 14:48.078
But I think his plays and a lot of his novels, like Malone Dies and Malloy, stand among the greatest work of the century.

14:48.098 --> 14:52.904
I couldn't say I was influenced by him, but I regard him as a great, great writer.

14:53.806 --> 15:02.357
To get back to the novella and the collection here, and I don't want to talk about the individual stories in here, because it's my job to read them and to...

15:03.113 --> 15:04.375
to talk about them.

15:04.415 --> 15:09.902
But I am impressed that, you know, to create a poet, obviously, you have to create his poetry.

15:10.463 --> 15:13.187
Could you talk about the challenge that that involved?

15:13.387 --> 15:15.450
And, of course, this person is not you.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.093
This person is smart, you know.

15:18.234 --> 15:23.121
Well, I had to be smart to write the poem the time I was writing the poem.

15:23.141 --> 15:27.066
I saw those fish up on the town of Alaska.

15:27.087 --> 15:28.508
I mean, that was a sight I saw.

15:29.310 --> 15:31.753
And I always wanted to write a poem about it.

15:32.493 --> 15:34.837
And I never could get one to my satisfaction.

15:34.877 --> 15:38.763
Like, you know, as with stories, I'm kind of a perfectionist with poems.

15:40.766 --> 15:44.512
And so I gave it to Smart to be his poem.

15:45.935 --> 15:48.679
And I left it somewhat fragmentary.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.088
But, you know, it's Smart's poem, but it's my poem.

15:54.108 --> 15:57.134
But it doesn't have to be perfect because it's Smart's poem, does it?

15:57.154 --> 15:59.418
It doesn't have to be complete.

15:59.438 --> 16:00.600
It doesn't have to be complete.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.783
It can remain a fragment.

16:02.364 --> 16:05.149
And yet you still get the satisfaction of having done that poem.

16:05.510 --> 16:05.790
Right.

16:06.698 --> 16:07.680
That's great.

16:10.945 --> 16:13.670
Tell me about the exercise of writing.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.194
This is the first collection, so we should talk about that.

16:16.975 --> 16:20.281
This is also the 30th anniversary year of your first novel.

16:22.104 --> 16:22.885
That's right.

16:23.067 --> 16:30.941
which we'll get to the novel in progress, but have you looked at stories as kind of finger exercises, as limbering up?

16:32.624 --> 16:35.189
No, I have a tremendous respect for the short story.

16:35.209 --> 16:41.160
I think some of the greatest works of the 20th century are short stories, like some of Hemingway's and some of Joyce's.

16:41.798 --> 16:46.606
If there's a better story in the world than Araby, than Joyce's Araby, I don't know what it is.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.409
The Open Boat I like a lot.

16:48.449 --> 16:52.735
Yeah, The Open Boat is, you know, his, I mean, that's Crane's greatest work, I think.

16:54.018 --> 16:56.301
Once is fiction and once is non-fiction.

16:56.321 --> 16:57.263
The Open Boat is good.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.070
No, I'm not, I have a lot of respect for it, maybe too much.

17:02.130 --> 17:03.673
Maybe that's why I don't do enough.

17:03.793 --> 17:04.895
I hope to do more.

17:06.137 --> 17:06.237
Well,

17:06.875 --> 17:10.640
Why 30 years then for the first collection to appear?

17:10.660 --> 17:19.413
I think because I was just kind of daunted and I was always working on a novel and I was always behind.

17:19.994 --> 17:26.964
And I did a lot of essays and assigned work in between, you know, and so forth.

17:26.984 --> 17:27.765
And I never sat down.

17:27.825 --> 17:32.292
And my standards were just, I think my standards were impossibly high.

17:33.774 --> 17:34.896
I just could never meet them.

17:36.498 --> 17:36.578
Hmm.

17:36.878 --> 17:43.383
And I... I mean, I did the first one a long time ago, back in 1969.

17:43.403 --> 17:44.025
Well, that's right.

17:44.045 --> 17:45.049
I saw that date, yeah.

17:46.013 --> 17:46.193
Yeah.

17:46.213 --> 17:46.635
But...

17:47.645 --> 17:49.167
I don't know.

17:49.187 --> 17:54.815
Did you work on it for this collection, or does that reflect Robert Stone in 1969?

17:54.936 --> 17:58.701
It pretty much reflects 1969.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.904
I didn't really go back and work on it.

18:00.924 --> 18:01.986
How do you feel about that?

18:02.206 --> 18:06.873
You know, Henry James, when he did the New York edition, I mean, he fooled around with the novels.

18:06.893 --> 18:07.534
Yes, I know.

18:09.397 --> 18:12.762
Well, I was tempted to do that, but I figured... Were you tempted to do that?

18:14.064 --> 18:17.128
I mean, I did reread them, and I thought of...

18:17.615 --> 18:18.536
making changes.

18:18.576 --> 18:21.700
My wife was always against it, and I sort of listened to her.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.345
Do you have an attitude on that, that completed work is completed work?

18:25.365 --> 18:25.826
In a way.

18:25.846 --> 18:28.489
In a way, I think that was it.

18:28.549 --> 18:32.535
I mean, you know, I had nothing more really to add to that story.

18:32.655 --> 18:40.585
I mean, that's just a goofy story about a bunch of heads, you know, in a time and place where, you know, kind of long gone.

18:40.784 --> 18:43.449
But it has its, you know, it has its resonance for now.

18:44.270 --> 18:51.042
If anybody wonders, you know, what it was like when all this crazy shit began, you know, where the war began.

18:51.122 --> 19:02.202
Well, where it does reflect 30 years of work, I mean, are you alert to that, that maybe the reader can see your development as a writer in these stories?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.244
Perhaps.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.010
I think I'm surprised.

19:07.812 --> 19:11.238
I think the early stuff reads pretty well to me.

19:11.258 --> 19:13.442
I don't know.

19:13.822 --> 19:17.609
I would have to leave that to the reader.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.853
I don't know the answer to that.

19:20.710 --> 19:24.878
But then obviously it hasn't occurred to you either in that respect.

19:25.078 --> 19:26.040
Well, it's occurred to me.

19:26.221 --> 19:26.421
Yeah.

19:26.561 --> 19:29.627
I mean, these stories get, you know, am I writing better?

19:30.449 --> 19:31.311
You know, a lot better.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.493
A little better.

19:33.555 --> 19:34.136
It's occurred to me.

19:35.218 --> 19:36.681
How are we coming on the new novel?

19:37.282 --> 19:38.204
Oh, I'm coming along.

19:38.364 --> 19:41.711
I hope to finish it before June, the end of June.

19:41.731 --> 19:42.853
And...

19:43.154 --> 19:47.079
I would like to bring it out on the spring list next year.

19:47.619 --> 19:52.044
So that would be almost like a conjunction of the planets to have two stone books out within a year.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.147
Yeah, I don't know whether it's a good idea or not.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.532
It's more like five to seven.

19:59.753 --> 20:05.500
But, yeah, it would be good to have it done, and I'd like to get into other things.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.622
Yeah.

20:07.702 --> 20:09.044
Other things, meaning other novels?

20:09.084 --> 20:15.010
Other novels, and I'd like to try writing something to the theater and do more short stories, but principally other novels.

20:15.030 --> 20:24.800
Now, in terms of stories, in terms of selection, there must have been... How many did you have to choose from, or was it pretty clear?

20:24.860 --> 20:29.244
Were you looking for something thematic in this selection of stories?

20:29.264 --> 20:31.186
Well, I was looking for the order.

20:31.226 --> 20:33.308
The order concerned me.

20:33.328 --> 20:34.930
I wanted the order to be right.

20:35.298 --> 20:43.156
And it wasn't hard to pick because I don't do many short stories and I'm pretty perfectionistic.

20:43.777 --> 20:49.510
If it wasn't up to it, I left it out.

20:50.114 --> 20:52.480
Were there stories that were on the borderline?

20:53.102 --> 20:54.666
I have a couple of stories sticking around.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.816
I don't think they're... But I haven't sent them out yet because I don't think they're ready.

20:59.879 --> 21:06.115
So therefore, this book, this collection of stories, in your view, should be considered...

21:06.095 --> 21:07.859
Right up there with the novels.

21:07.959 --> 21:11.105
I mean, these are not exercises, in your view.

21:11.626 --> 21:12.167
No, no.

21:12.207 --> 21:14.351
Because of the standards that you have placed upon them.

21:14.572 --> 21:16.796
No, I don't see them as mere exercises.

21:16.816 --> 21:20.664
I mean, I guess I would put them up there with the novels.

21:20.744 --> 21:22.568
I mean, I don't see it as lesser.

21:22.969 --> 21:23.650
It's shorter.

21:24.231 --> 21:25.133
There's less in it.

21:25.670 --> 21:31.040
But I don't think, you know, as a work of art, it's a lesser vehicle.

21:32.863 --> 21:37.612
There's a quote here, this enormous empty space from which God has absented himself.

21:39.315 --> 21:40.998
You know, which I pulled out of the story.

21:41.098 --> 21:46.708
I'm just wondering, you know, is it a case throughout the body of your work?

21:46.748 --> 21:50.074
I mean, is it a case of...

21:50.830 --> 21:59.743
You know, the fatal flaw, the gods throwing, as we said earlier, craps with our destinies like flies to wanton boys.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.928
Are we to the gods, etc.?

22:03.108 --> 22:05.431
Well, I think it's more or less that we're left on our own.

22:06.593 --> 22:12.602
You know, I don't think it's so much God controlling destiny as just not being, just, you know, having...

22:13.375 --> 22:14.757
imploded or something.

22:14.798 --> 22:30.325
I mean, there's a number of doctrines around that, you know, from the Barthian Deus Absconditus to, you know, to the Kabbalistic Ensoph, the withdrawn God.

22:31.067 --> 22:34.994
And I've always sort of seen things that way.

22:35.014 --> 22:36.396
And do you...

22:36.730 --> 22:49.750
feel that these characters have the so-called, you're talking about the theater, the fatal flaw, you know, that ultimately brings down the character.

22:49.770 --> 22:51.553
Are we all the fatal flaw?

22:51.914 --> 22:56.160
I think a lot of them are in need of salvation.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.422
It's just not worth coming.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.065
Okay.

23:01.026 --> 23:03.850
This temple cavern, is this a place that you visited?

23:04.271 --> 23:14.827
Well, there's a number of places out west kind of like that caverns and caverns and lava fields and so forth that are really kind of spooky.

23:16.209 --> 23:18.772
And when you enter a place like this, do the stories start?

23:18.793 --> 23:19.774
Do you feel the juices?

23:20.595 --> 23:22.798
Do you feel narrative perking forth?

23:23.259 --> 23:24.601
You feel the charge of the place.

23:24.641 --> 23:27.966
I don't think the first time I went to

23:28.503 --> 23:38.879
You know, there's lava beds out there in southern Idaho that I was thinking, you know, I'm going to write a story about this, but they kind of stayed with me.

23:39.280 --> 23:45.530
But the images stay with you, and then, so it's almost impossible to pinpoint where this process gets going then.

23:46.752 --> 23:46.872
Right.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.394
I guess, right?

23:48.634 --> 23:50.437
Right.

23:50.457 --> 23:56.687
You know, I've always read a lot about Indian things, American Indian things.

23:56.954 --> 24:01.780
I know the legends around the lava beds and so forth.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.464
And that went in finally.

24:04.504 --> 24:06.907
I didn't think of using that as a story.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.811
I mean, I was thinking about writing about Indians.

24:10.011 --> 24:15.799
But I did make him a Shoshone Paiute.

24:15.819 --> 24:24.651
John hears the sun come up because Jack Wilson, as he was known, the guy who founded the ghost dance religion, was a Shoshone Paiute.

24:25.572 --> 24:25.712
Uh-huh.

24:26.182 --> 24:30.947
And the ghost dance religion really begins with him hearing the sun come up.

24:33.589 --> 24:36.452
I'm not going to take up too much of your time this morning.

24:36.712 --> 24:39.675
Is there anything you can tell me about the new novel, the title?

24:40.436 --> 24:41.857
Damascus Gate.

24:41.877 --> 24:42.678
Say again, I'm sorry?

24:42.698 --> 24:44.120
Damascus Gate.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.201
Damascus Gate.

24:46.522 --> 24:49.685
And with the good Lord willing, we'll see it next year.

24:50.346 --> 24:51.767
God willing.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.681
That's great.

24:54.883 --> 24:56.224
I won't hold you up this morning.

24:56.284 --> 24:56.725
I'm sorry.

24:56.765 --> 24:58.967
I thought you kind of expected me to call.

24:58.987 --> 25:09.138
If she said anything, I spaced it.

25:09.199 --> 25:11.101
I'm getting ready to go north.

25:11.361 --> 25:13.403
There's just a lot of things going on.

25:13.984 --> 25:16.126
I'm sorry not to be ready for you.

25:16.587 --> 25:17.548
Listen, I'm going to let you go.

25:17.588 --> 25:18.909
I've got plenty of stuff here.

25:19.290 --> 25:21.332
I look forward to the novel.

25:21.616 --> 25:24.139
I would much prefer to do these things in person.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.644
I have to tell you, the telephone interview does.

25:27.684 --> 25:30.427
There's a distance to it.

25:30.788 --> 25:32.830
I'm sorry we couldn't do it.

25:33.091 --> 25:38.177
I'm giving a talk out in Minneapolis next week, and there's a conflict there.

25:38.858 --> 25:43.024
I'm surprised your guy gets too grand, though, for a talk out in Nevada.

25:43.044 --> 25:45.767
In these places, that's a pretty good honorarium.

25:45.747 --> 25:49.633
Yeah, that's, well, you know, he's getting, was he getting two grand each?

25:49.653 --> 25:51.396
Two grand a pop, yeah, for six.

25:52.298 --> 25:58.368
That's not, well, I mean, the honorariums have, they've gone up a little.

25:58.428 --> 25:59.189
They have, in fact.

25:59.209 --> 26:04.077
He's a local poet, and he's not altogether unknown, and they have, and some of those places have,

26:04.546 --> 26:05.770
a fair amount of money.

26:05.931 --> 26:06.292
They do.

26:06.413 --> 26:08.520
I'm discovering a little bit of this myself.

26:09.002 --> 26:13.900
That scene where he throws the poems at the window, though, is this something that you've heard about?

26:14.181 --> 26:16.108
Oh, I don't know where it got there.

26:16.763 --> 26:18.807
You talk about self-destructive behavior.

26:19.127 --> 26:21.251
Well, that's this guy.

26:21.271 --> 26:21.451
Yeah.

26:22.313 --> 26:23.314
Listen, thank you very much.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.576
Is it a nice day down there?

26:24.817 --> 26:26.239
It's beautiful.

26:26.279 --> 26:32.690
I mean, they do tend to be, especially in the early morning, you know, it's nice.

26:32.931 --> 26:34.974
It's a nice time of year down here.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.759
I'm curious, have you gone out at night to look at the comet?

26:38.228 --> 26:39.350
I haven't, no.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.733
I've read about the comet somewhere.

26:41.834 --> 26:42.655
Go out about 7.15.

26:43.256 --> 26:45.018
Well, it may be a little later down there.

26:45.058 --> 26:47.582
You've got to catch it early in the night in the northwest sky.

26:47.863 --> 26:49.706
It's awesome.

26:50.607 --> 26:52.550
Well, I really might.

26:52.570 --> 26:58.759
You've got a couple weeks to see it, and I won't be back for 70,000 years or something.

26:58.779 --> 27:00.562
Well, I'd better make it this time.

27:00.582 --> 27:01.063
Okay.

27:01.544 --> 27:02.165
Thanks for your time.

27:02.285 --> 27:02.645
You bet.

27:02.665 --> 27:03.006
Good luck.

27:03.667 --> 27:03.747
Bye.
