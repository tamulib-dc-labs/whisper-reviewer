00:01.938 --> 00:02.339
Go ahead.

00:02.539 --> 00:03.400
The book situation?

00:03.741 --> 00:15.857
It was very different from his collections of other things, which he collected to excess, knew a great deal about from a design standpoint.

00:15.978 --> 00:18.902
He knows a great deal about doorknobs.

00:19.663 --> 00:21.445
He gave me one.

00:21.465 --> 00:24.229
You know, this machine, it just stops.

00:24.289 --> 00:26.292
I want you to say once more, if you can.

00:27.149 --> 00:29.211
about the gentle, loving person that he is.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.033
I don't want to miss that quote.

00:31.053 --> 00:36.378
If you could just try and remember or say it again once more, the tape had stopped.

00:37.459 --> 00:38.841
I just want to make sure I have that.

00:40.743 --> 00:52.074
Well, Stephen is an individual whom I think many people love.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.139
People who

00:57.355 --> 01:00.299
are very ordinary people.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.064
Mrs. Hall would be perhaps a good example.

01:04.225 --> 01:05.927
Isn't that what you were telling me about him?

01:05.947 --> 01:08.831
You said he is a loving, he's a gentle person.

01:09.232 --> 01:09.512
Yes.

01:10.053 --> 01:18.024
The suggestion that he might be the hardened criminal, you know, which was the master thief.

01:18.564 --> 01:21.348
Stephen is the antithesis of the hardened criminal.

01:22.670 --> 01:23.692
He's in no sense.

01:25.474 --> 01:26.856
He hasn't got the...

01:27.832 --> 01:31.997
He hasn't got the makeup of a hardened criminal at all.

01:33.038 --> 01:34.200
He wouldn't hire him a fly.

01:35.561 --> 01:38.986
It would be a tragedy then to put him into a prison, wouldn't it, with these people?

01:40.087 --> 01:46.475
I think it would be a real tragedy, except that he would find somebody to love him there, for some reason.

01:46.495 --> 01:51.341
He told me that when he was going with Jefferson, that the head mafia guy wanted to talk to him.

01:51.361 --> 01:56.387
He was a celebrity, you know, because he wanted to know how come he didn't take things that were more liquid, like gold or jewelry.

01:56.873 --> 02:02.081
How he finds people to love him, I don't know.

02:03.122 --> 02:17.063
And he was down in this Missouri place, Springfield, and a great big tough guy comes up to him and says, I'm going to be your friend.

02:17.083 --> 02:17.864
Yeah, we're all set.

02:18.485 --> 02:18.966
We're all done.

02:21.550 --> 02:22.671
Yeah, we're going to wrap it up now.

02:23.973 --> 02:25.716
Okay, the only thing is...
