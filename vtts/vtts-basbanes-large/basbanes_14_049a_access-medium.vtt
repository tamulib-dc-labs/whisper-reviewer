WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:06.806
We're talking to—my middle initial is A, by the way.

00:06.866 --> 00:07.727
I'm Arthur.

00:07.907 --> 00:11.670
Arthur, I'm Andrew.

00:11.710 --> 00:17.035
Tell me, how long have you been involved with, you know, let's start with the very basic— With the library?

00:17.975 --> 00:31.827
I've been involved since 1988, when Art Agnos, who was then mayor in his first year, asked me to go on the library commission.

00:32.482 --> 00:40.109
And then he asked me to be its president before the day that I was sworn in on the commission, which would then September 1st of 88.

00:40.309 --> 00:41.430
He asked me to be its president.

00:42.270 --> 00:46.954
And on the November ballot was the bond issue to build the new main library.

00:47.835 --> 00:52.779
And he wanted me to go work on that, and he thought I would be a natural.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.803
I used to be a state legislator in Nevada for a state assemblyman.

00:57.744 --> 01:01.527
And he was an assemblyman from California before he was elected mayor.

01:02.047 --> 01:03.991
And we hit it off quite well.

01:04.873 --> 01:15.837
And so I went on the commission, and within a week I was out on the campaign trail talking to community groups about supporting the bond issue, which I didn't know a whole lot about at the time.

01:16.238 --> 01:20.044
So, you didn't have a background in libraries or anything like that.

01:20.464 --> 01:26.132
I mean, you had some experience in politics, which is helpful, and when you're dealing with the political issues.

01:26.152 --> 01:33.163
Yeah, well, I was a journalist, and I had a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Nevada, Reno.

01:33.183 --> 01:33.783
Oh, right.

01:33.804 --> 01:43.798
I used to work, when I was in the Army, worked at UPI, audio services in Washington, television in Reno.

01:44.909 --> 02:00.915
basically public relations, government relations here with the old Pacific Telephone, now Pacific Bell, part of SPC Communications as of April of this year.

02:00.935 --> 02:12.013
And I've dealt with, in most of my 17 years in the business, I've dealt with government relations kind of issues, philanthropy,

02:13.225 --> 02:18.873
social issues impacting the business and positions we should take, special interest groups.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.275
Those have always been my focus.

02:22.759 --> 02:26.985
For example, how does the corporation deal with the AIDS issue?

02:27.065 --> 02:29.608
How does a corporation deal with multi-local services?

02:29.628 --> 02:34.896
How does a corporation deal with minority women's procurement issues?

02:44.022 --> 02:46.605
What should the corporation do?

02:47.086 --> 02:56.316
Sometimes we try to get out early and understand issues that may be coming along that can help or hurt the business.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.460
And, I mean, it's been my specialty.

03:01.402 --> 03:05.747
And convince the business to do something or not do something.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.431
We have a lot of consumer advisory groups we deal with.

03:09.011 --> 03:13.877
We have agreements with special interest communities, the Hispanic community.

03:14.195 --> 03:25.169
The NAACP, the Asian community, the consumer groups in general, meets every couple of months with us, a whole group of them, and we talk about a whole range of issues.

03:25.970 --> 03:30.476
So it's how does a corporation fit well within the society, which is part.

03:30.496 --> 03:31.558
That's kind of what I do.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.160
How does a corporation fit?

03:33.780 --> 03:39.147
Which is not quite public relations, although I deal with a lot of public relations issues.

03:39.188 --> 03:41.130
I've had lobbyists reporting into me,

03:41.532 --> 03:51.443
But my specialty has always been on that piece of it, the role of the corporation within the communities it serves on a policy level.

03:51.483 --> 03:52.965
So what's your title, just for the record?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.107
Public Affairs Vice President.

03:58.771 --> 03:59.512
Okay, good.

04:01.294 --> 04:04.718
So did Art Agnose, by the way, go to Bates College in Maine?

04:04.818 --> 04:06.119
Do you happen to know that?

04:07.461 --> 04:09.683
I went to college with an Art Agnose.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.893
He's on the 60s coast.

04:10.953 --> 04:12.094
He's on the 60s coast.

04:12.114 --> 04:12.655
It's Art Agnos.

04:12.995 --> 04:14.256
Do you talk with him at all?

04:15.277 --> 04:18.240
Yeah, I mean, his wife and I are on the library commission, Sherry.

04:18.641 --> 04:19.141
That's funny.

04:19.522 --> 04:21.183
I know it's the same Art Agnos.

04:21.203 --> 04:23.045
How many Art Agnoses can there be in the world?

04:23.065 --> 04:27.149
I mean, he studied, I was thinking it was Massachusetts.

04:27.229 --> 04:29.692
Well, it's Maine, which is up there.

04:29.732 --> 04:32.034
I think he's from Massachusetts, actually.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.738
But he studied social welfare issues.

04:36.055 --> 04:41.863
Yeah, I knew him in college, he was about a year or two.

04:41.943 --> 04:42.043
Okay.

04:42.063 --> 04:43.165
A nice guy, tough guy.

04:43.225 --> 04:50.175
He caused himself problems, killed himself his first term as governor, because his mayor should not have lost.

04:52.058 --> 04:56.684
But he did, because he was just too dictatorial to the groups.

04:56.704 --> 04:59.027
San Francisco is a very, very difficult city, politically.

04:59.548 --> 05:00.109
Oh, sure.

05:00.209 --> 05:05.877
But I'm from Boston, so I'm not unfamiliar with the... I know Boston a little bit.

05:06.329 --> 05:08.952
and some of the politics there.

05:08.992 --> 05:23.045
This, you've got certainly no racial majority in San Francisco, and you've got a real split between sort of the neighborhood activists, which are the classic NIMBYs.

05:23.906 --> 05:24.667
Meaning what?

05:24.687 --> 05:25.628
Not in my backyard.

05:26.408 --> 05:27.810
You know, you're going to do what?

05:27.830 --> 05:29.511
You're going to do anything in my backyard?

05:29.892 --> 05:30.092
No.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.134
You know, that just doesn't work.

05:32.485 --> 05:35.468
Well, you've heard about the Patriots trying to get into South Boston, right?

05:35.829 --> 05:42.496
I mean, Boston doesn't want the Patriots, but it's quite specifically not in my backyard.

05:42.556 --> 05:46.541
And change in the status quo drives people crazy.

05:47.642 --> 05:54.610
Anything you want to do will bring out a certain set of activists, and then if it's fun, you'll get a pile-on of other activists.

05:54.630 --> 05:57.894
I mean, this is a city that has a fair number of gadflies.

05:57.954 --> 05:59.235
Each commission has got

05:59.587 --> 06:00.208
One or two.

06:00.288 --> 06:01.228
Some have got more.

06:01.289 --> 06:03.991
We've got quite a few at the library in the last couple of years.

06:05.012 --> 06:10.237
But their sole purpose is to attend and question and what have you.

06:10.257 --> 06:13.339
We've got some now that sue us all the time over open meetings issues.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.941
It's a fascinating thing.

06:14.961 --> 06:15.982
It's a contact sport.

06:16.963 --> 06:18.684
No question about that politics.

06:19.665 --> 06:21.386
And it can be really, really tough.

06:22.207 --> 06:28.733
And Willie Brown is paying a price for moving as much of an agenda as he has done.

06:29.236 --> 06:38.409
He's starting, his huge popularity is finally starting to come down a little bit just because he plays tough, plays to win.

06:39.211 --> 06:44.618
And the other side is play to win, too, like the big fight over the 49ers stadium.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.500
They'll fight to the death.

06:45.540 --> 06:49.285
They'll do everything to destroy the guy over time, you know, pounding him.

06:49.305 --> 06:54.393
They'll finally get three different organizations that will come in and check the validity of the last election.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.054
They won't stop.

06:55.154 --> 06:57.437
Nothing phases anyone.

06:57.704 --> 07:01.849
No matter how many times they turn down, they come back again and again and again and try to wear you down.

07:02.230 --> 07:04.793
Agnos couldn't deal with it on as many forums as there.

07:05.213 --> 07:09.899
Willie is just an extraordinary guy and is doing fine with it.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.741
He's got the right attitude.

07:11.762 --> 07:12.583
He's a pro.

07:12.603 --> 07:13.984
He's a real pro.

07:14.845 --> 07:16.047
I was out here in the late 60s.

07:16.127 --> 07:21.634
I actually was in San Francisco for three years.

07:21.654 --> 07:23.496
I mean, Willie Brown was a force then.

07:24.377 --> 07:24.938
He's amazing.

07:25.078 --> 07:25.939
He's an amazing guy.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.441
So, you know, I'm pleased that I'm

07:27.725 --> 07:32.250
You know, one of his appointees on his commission, and he likes the library.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.813
It's not on his top ten list, but he likes the library.

07:36.214 --> 07:39.978
He likes the library because it's important to have a library, or what do you think?

07:39.998 --> 07:42.080
I mean, he likes the library.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.104
He's carried library legislation during his time as Speaker.

07:46.605 --> 07:51.270
When stuff comes up that's important, he's always been very approachable and interested in the subject.

07:51.930 --> 07:56.415
He was a significant donor to the library in his own right, wrote us a nice-sized check.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.753
We had a big fundraiser for the African American Center and raised money.

08:00.234 --> 08:12.690
We had a big fundraiser for the African American Center, and they were, their goal was half a million dollars, and they were sitting at 460 or 80, I don't remember what it was.

08:12.710 --> 08:17.576
And he took the microphone, and it was at, you know, a lovely auditorium.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.658
He says, close the doors.

08:18.718 --> 08:22.263
And he said, nobody's going to leave until we raise $500,000 in this room.

08:22.343 --> 08:25.727
And then he just started berating people in the audience.

08:26.180 --> 08:31.027
You know, what have you put in on this thing, $1,000, $2,000, come on, you can do $5,000.

08:31.047 --> 08:35.012
$5,000, Mark, you know, Joe's going to do $5,000.

08:35.092 --> 08:37.275
Sally, you know, you're as rich as they come.

08:37.615 --> 08:38.837
You know, and it was boom, boom, boom.

08:38.857 --> 08:43.063
And I think we ended up with $525, something like that.

08:44.345 --> 08:45.506
Yeah, put it over the top.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.127
Just amazing.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.911
And plus he did a handsome donation in his own right.

08:49.331 --> 08:49.892
So...

08:50.193 --> 08:52.575
And he was fun in terms of the opening of the library.

08:52.996 --> 08:56.420
Behind the scenes, he's been tough in terms of the problems we've had.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.362
But I think he cares about the library.

08:58.642 --> 09:01.445
I think he sees it as an institution that's important to the city.

09:02.065 --> 09:07.811
It was important to him as a young man, as a place to go and, you know, study and what have you.

09:07.831 --> 09:10.494
Because he's from a hard-scrabble life coming in.

09:10.514 --> 09:12.476
That's one of the things that makes him so interesting.

09:12.496 --> 09:13.297
He was a native San Franciscan?

09:13.377 --> 09:14.078
Native Texan.

09:14.278 --> 09:14.579
Oh, really?

09:14.599 --> 09:17.922
Who came here and lived with his uncle, who just died.

09:18.593 --> 09:20.275
in the last few months.

09:21.316 --> 09:26.383
And so, you know, went to, did you go to San Francisco State?

09:27.404 --> 09:27.765
I don't remember.

09:27.785 --> 09:28.986
Then law school.

09:29.006 --> 09:29.266
I don't know.

09:29.286 --> 09:34.153
But it was, I mean, the library has played a role within his life.

09:34.193 --> 09:39.960
He respects what they are to a neighborhood and to the city as a whole as an intellectual resource.

09:40.060 --> 09:46.508
So he's been helpful, although it's not on the priority list when you look at the problems of police and

09:46.927 --> 09:51.493
That's what you see in this.

09:51.513 --> 09:52.735
That's everywhere, too.

09:52.755 --> 10:06.013
That's what you see in this, the story of a city that basically, despite the politicians, has put together a decent library system that's on the rebound again after basically decades of official neglect.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.778
So you came in in 1988.

10:10.687 --> 10:12.950
And what did you feel your responsibility was?

10:13.070 --> 10:19.158
I mean, to get a library, or did the library have to just enter the discussion?

10:20.639 --> 10:40.204
Well, the charge immediately was to pass the bond issue, and then see the, you know, launch the building of the new main library, and address the policy issues that we had within the system for the library, and do it well.

10:41.112 --> 10:44.957
If you go back, one of the people you may want to talk to would be Kevin Starr.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.098
I chatted with him.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.800
He's on that list, yeah.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.143
Kevin used to be City Librarian in San Francisco.

10:50.163 --> 10:51.245
He had a tumultuous time.

10:52.006 --> 10:54.269
He opposed to helping him.

10:54.289 --> 10:56.151
He was not supportive, initially.

10:57.993 --> 11:08.166
His position, because he did a media thing for us when we opened the new Maine, in 1987 San Francisco had arguably the worst urban library in America.

11:09.142 --> 11:11.144
Worst in what respect?

11:11.224 --> 11:11.965
The facility?

11:11.985 --> 11:13.026
The infrastructure?

11:13.046 --> 11:14.127
How about the collections?

11:14.167 --> 11:15.768
Facilities, the infrastructure.

11:16.269 --> 11:18.011
I mean, there was no online catalog yet.

11:18.031 --> 11:20.873
The card catalog itself was a disaster.

11:20.933 --> 11:28.901
You had a few materials were in bad shape.

11:29.382 --> 11:31.063
You haven't been buying much for years.

11:31.103 --> 11:35.347
There was no cohesive plan on collection development or management.

11:36.268 --> 11:38.170
The hours were always reducing.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.641
within the institution.

11:39.681 --> 11:45.208
It was an institution looking backward rather than forward.

11:45.228 --> 11:47.951
I mean, he can talk to you about what was wrong with it.

11:48.572 --> 11:52.096
He's quite a respected historian.

11:52.436 --> 11:53.137
He's an historian.

11:53.397 --> 11:58.463
He helped us on the Pioneer Monument fight, which is an example of the kinds of fights we've got.

11:58.664 --> 12:06.773
Anyway, his other quote was that as the new library is opening in 1996, it has moved

12:07.090 --> 12:09.013
to the cutting edge in some areas.

12:09.273 --> 12:13.940
It is amazing how fast the library has moved as an institution.

12:14.340 --> 12:19.808
He did not think it was ever going to be possible to see these kind of changes happen in an institution.

12:20.349 --> 12:22.352
That has been both our strength and our weakness.

12:22.472 --> 12:32.005
We have moved so far so fast that the culture of the institution, and even for some of the community dealing with it, they've had a hard time.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.549
Tens of thousands of others, though, love it.

12:35.137 --> 12:40.904
We're still doing 6,000 or 7,000 people a day in the new main library.

12:41.084 --> 12:42.045
What are they doing?

12:42.145 --> 12:46.530
Are you taking help when you get that many people?

12:46.550 --> 12:47.291
They're coming in.

12:47.832 --> 12:50.515
You'll see a lot of people go right to computers.

12:50.555 --> 12:53.298
Some people go right to workstations.

12:53.379 --> 12:56.843
People go right to books and materials they're interested in.

12:57.764 --> 13:00.587
We have a large number of...

13:01.293 --> 13:10.386
Small businessmen and investors, I mean, they just love going to the business section and pulling out investors' newsletters and that kind of stuff.

13:11.067 --> 13:17.556
The Children's Center is always packed, both the Children's Electronic Discovery Center as well as books.

13:17.636 --> 13:24.326
Children's books are up in addition to the great popularity of the Electronic Discovery Center.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.350
People do just about everything you can think of.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.532
People come in and meet.

13:29.035 --> 13:30.917
Our meeting rooms are very popular.

13:30.937 --> 13:32.759
They're always booked.

13:33.439 --> 13:35.942
We do exhibits now that we never did before.

13:35.962 --> 13:42.708
We have a little cafe, a little tiny one within the building, so people come in and stay a long time.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.513
They do anything you would expect someone to do in a big urban library.

13:48.533 --> 13:57.642
We have vastly expanded collections since we've gone from a—when I was fired from the commission in 90— Vastly expanded collections.

13:58.972 --> 14:06.481
It went from a budget that was at $1 million a year to the first year the property went to $4.5 million.

14:06.922 --> 14:13.730
We're doing about $3.5 million a year on new materials for the system.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.312
Now, it's not necessarily books, though.

14:15.412 --> 14:17.915
That could be computer equipment or whatever.

14:17.935 --> 14:18.936
Not computer equipment.

14:18.956 --> 14:23.482
It could certainly be databases, magazines.

14:24.383 --> 14:28.067
It could be microfilm, but most of it's books.

14:29.937 --> 14:38.872
Did you, in your mind, have a view of what the library should be, what it should look like?

14:39.894 --> 14:40.755
What it should look like?

14:40.935 --> 14:41.897
Not necessarily.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.122
I started forming some views as we started.

14:45.142 --> 14:55.219
I went around, tried to visit coming on the commission, visit the main library, set up meetings with people in different departments.

14:55.486 --> 15:02.415
I wandered through some of the branches, listened for a long time at public hearings, see what sort of people coming up, what their problems were.

15:02.856 --> 15:09.224
I spent a lot of time talking with staff because it's a non-paid position to be a library commissioner in San Francisco.

15:09.244 --> 15:10.546
You don't even get paid for your expenses.

15:11.507 --> 15:18.256
I tried to understand the institution, tried to look at its problems, and tried to bring my own background on it.

15:18.876 --> 15:23.543
I found an institution that was polarized between the main and the branches.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.425
I thought it was a really

15:26.131 --> 15:35.162
almost scary way to look at an institution of the complexity that we had within a library, even the library that existed in 1988 when I came on.

15:37.365 --> 15:38.687
And you always saw these fights.

15:38.747 --> 15:42.912
Everything was, well, as for the Maine, you know, the rich Maine, well, the Maine was a disaster.

15:43.332 --> 15:45.956
There's a column that I tried to find from you.

15:47.097 --> 15:49.000
It was written when Ken Dowling came on.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.421
It's really a hoot.

15:50.441 --> 15:55.007
It talks about week 87.

15:55.443 --> 15:58.327
We hope Ken Dowlin is the Clint Eastwood of librarians.

15:58.987 --> 16:10.702
He refers to the old name as a disgrace, that the best thing that could happen to it would be a good fire, that the materials were hopelessly dated, new stuff not coming in.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.506
This urine stench was overwhelming within the building.

16:14.526 --> 16:18.471
It was a fire hazard, stuff stacked around in the hallways.

16:19.092 --> 16:21.314
It was just a disgrace to the library world.

16:21.995 --> 16:22.576
And that's 1987.

16:22.596 --> 16:24.218
Ken had not started yet.

16:24.569 --> 16:25.931
And who wrote that piece?

16:25.951 --> 16:31.219
This was a columnist for The Examiner.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.547
Interesting.

16:36.767 --> 16:37.067
It would.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.110
I'm trying to think of where I would have that.

16:44.899 --> 16:47.843
We'd like to probably find it for you.

16:49.915 --> 17:01.830
So I was concerned in looking at this sort of split between branches and neighborhoods, and I started wandering through the institution, seeing its different parts.

17:02.511 --> 17:07.196
I went into the special collections section, for example, in the Old Main.

17:08.918 --> 17:17.509
The librarian then in charge was not real happy about someone wandering through and looking behind the stacks, the closed stacks that she had there.

17:17.894 --> 17:20.878
But I was president of the commission, so she really could not deny me.

17:21.839 --> 17:32.111
And, you know, I discovered the Schmaluwitz Wit & Humor Collection, for example, which was, what do we add, about 30,000, 40,000 volumes.

17:32.672 --> 17:39.880
Nate Schmaluwitz was a commissioner in, what, the 50s or the 60s, left the library's first endowed collection.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.802
He left his Wit & Humor Collection.

17:42.483 --> 17:46.568
Nate Schmaluwitz has to see the Schmaluwitz Wit & Humor Collection when you go there.

17:47.122 --> 17:56.051
They have it written up on one of the, they usually do on one of the background pieces on the library, and see if I .

17:56.071 --> 17:58.113
So you saw this collection?

17:58.133 --> 17:58.693
Oh, I'll find it.

17:58.713 --> 18:02.917
Like, I looked at that, and I looked at some of the other stuff, and I thought, God, there's some really great stuff here.

18:04.199 --> 18:10.965
As I traveled around the country on business, I would always try to go in and talk to people about libraries.

18:11.726 --> 18:16.791
You know, when I was in Boston, I went in at the, what's his name, Curly, who's your librarian?

18:17.395 --> 18:21.120
I think his name was Curly.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.282
Curly was either first name or last name, I can't remember.

18:23.302 --> 18:27.547
But, you know, went in, saw the old library, which I think is wonderful, the new edition that had been done.

18:28.028 --> 18:30.211
Met with his staff, took tours, talked to him.

18:30.551 --> 18:32.974
Did the same with New York Public.

18:33.435 --> 18:36.218
De Janeiro was the number two guy at that point.

18:36.799 --> 18:40.684
Spent some time with him, met with his folks, toured the institution.

18:40.844 --> 18:45.850
Well, what kinds of questions did you ask?

18:46.235 --> 18:54.007
how they perceived their role in the community, the kind of collections they had, what the community demands were, what their usage was.

18:54.428 --> 19:01.840
I talked a lot about fundraising, because I knew we had to raise a huge amount of money for the new main library, trying to figure things out.

19:02.821 --> 19:07.369
Then I saw the Schaumburg, which I frankly had never even heard of before.

19:07.409 --> 19:08.591
It's in my book.

19:09.091 --> 19:09.953
And I loved it.

19:10.574 --> 19:11.896
What did you love about it?

19:11.996 --> 19:13.238
I loved the concept.

19:13.555 --> 19:32.511
of an institution within an institution, one that spoke eloquently to the hearts and minds of a given constituency, one that was seen as an international resource within a given city boundary, one that was multimedia in its collection.

19:33.632 --> 19:40.978
And I thought that was just about one of the great services I had seen in the library.

19:41.278 --> 19:43.360
And I was determined we were going to do something

19:43.778 --> 19:46.221
like that back in San Francisco.

19:47.183 --> 19:50.628
And I didn't know what, but I got everything that I could on it.

19:51.649 --> 20:07.051
And I even underwrote, so I had Pac Bell underwrite, an exhibit of Schmaluwitz, one of their exhibits, just to come out, just so that the old main library would start reaching out to communities that were not being served.

20:07.071 --> 20:10.275
If you seriously looked at San Francisco's library,

20:10.728 --> 20:18.478
few years ago, we had branches that were in minority areas, and they did modest amounts of things, the librarian that may be in charge of that branch.

20:19.059 --> 20:21.682
But the main library didn't.

20:21.702 --> 20:38.845
I went and visited the Eureka Valley Harvey Milk Memorial Branch, which was just a few blocks from my house, and thought it was really cool that they had started developing a lot of game materials.

20:39.382 --> 20:51.895
just stacks of old newspapers, the various gay, lesbian newspapers in the Bay Area, and a modest little collection of books.

20:53.216 --> 21:01.224
And I thought that was very significant for what it was doing to that neighborhood, but it didn't amount to much.

21:02.585 --> 21:07.110
Why wasn't the library doing more serious kind of outreach to that community?

21:07.580 --> 21:11.604
which was, is a huge community in San Francisco, and I'm gay myself.

21:12.104 --> 21:20.632
So I'm sitting there looking at that and thinking, in the gay world, gays are often excluded from history.

21:20.652 --> 21:32.102
If you look at what happens with the Hirschfield collection and Berlin, what have you, Byrne, gays are socially unacceptable, often.

21:32.122 --> 21:35.005
There's quite a collection at Cornell now, you know.

21:36.200 --> 21:45.114
But as a public library, they didn't exist anywhere.

21:45.855 --> 21:54.228
Now, when you're talking about a gay lesbian collection, are you talking about published books, or are you also talking about research materials, archival materials?

21:54.268 --> 21:55.911
Both.

21:55.931 --> 22:02.882
So we started— I mean, to me, I think that could be one of the great, great things that San Francisco could do.

22:03.284 --> 22:10.014
considerable population here of creative, artistic people who happen to be gay and lesbian.

22:10.034 --> 22:17.205
And there must be extraordinary archival materials that you would be able to get access to.

22:17.365 --> 22:28.642
And if you were able to do that, boy, I'd say, and I don't know whether you are or you aren't, but it would seem to me that that would be the kind of thing that you could really... Well, let's lay out what we did.

22:29.003 --> 22:29.764
We brought it up.

22:30.757 --> 22:33.521
to the idea of a gay Schomburg.

22:34.723 --> 22:43.555
We brought it up to some of the gay and lesbian leaders in the community, and they were split on it.

22:43.796 --> 22:51.346
These are people that were active, like we had an advisory committee to the Eureka Valley Harvey Milk French that just helped out with the minimal amount of stuff.

22:51.366 --> 22:52.949
And there were probably about ten people at the meeting.

22:53.429 --> 23:00.139
And I went in, I handed out some Schomburg materials, and I said, what do you think of the idea of doing a gay Schomburg in the new main library?

23:00.946 --> 23:20.495
That we would organize as a community around that, and that we would seek to have both archival materials, research materials, as well as, you know, regularly published books and materials, that we might even set up our own center within the library.

23:21.236 --> 23:22.397
And then they split.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.160
Some thought that it was pie in the sky.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.645
Some thought it was really interesting.

23:31.135 --> 23:33.478
further and further down the line.

23:33.999 --> 23:36.223
Ken Dallin bought in on it, said, I like the idea.

23:36.243 --> 23:37.084
It makes good sense.

23:37.685 --> 23:39.147
This is a community.

23:39.327 --> 23:48.681
Because we had to look, if we were going to do something outside of what the budget provided, because the budget was just minimal, minimal kinds of maintenance within the system at that point in time.

23:48.701 --> 23:50.724
The budget, you mean for acquiring material?

23:50.744 --> 23:50.984
Yeah.

23:51.004 --> 23:56.553
I mean, just the budget in general for the library system was really cheap.

23:56.573 --> 24:00.298
I mean, would you say you're going to establish a gay lesbian center?

24:00.667 --> 24:06.114
Are you also talking about, well, look at the traffic going home now.

24:06.134 --> 24:08.718
This is really, pardon me for it.

24:09.539 --> 24:19.953
Are you talking also, not only, I mean, the physical structure is wonderful, great, but are you also talking about getting staff, getting a librarian, getting somebody involved in acquisitions?

24:19.993 --> 24:22.676
Let me just walk through what we ended up doing.

24:23.457 --> 24:29.205
At Allen bought in on it, we found space within the new main library,

24:29.472 --> 24:34.759
They had a number of round rooms that were going to be sort of like sitting areas, reading areas.

24:34.779 --> 24:35.840
Affinity centers.

24:35.860 --> 24:36.541
Affinity centers.

24:37.222 --> 24:38.404
That's what we call them now.

24:38.444 --> 24:45.913
At that point in time, this is 1989, we were still discussing the concept of this.

24:46.794 --> 24:49.979
We'd have to raise money in order to do it.

24:49.999 --> 24:58.770
The gay community, we thought, one is a politically influential, large percentage of the population in San Francisco is gay, lesbians.

24:59.493 --> 25:02.817
We aren't doing much with them at all as a library institution.

25:03.658 --> 25:06.142
They could raise the money to do this.

25:06.322 --> 25:07.744
You mean the community could raise the money?

25:07.764 --> 25:10.768
The community could raise the money to launch a center.

25:12.470 --> 25:16.095
Although a lot of people questioned whether we could do it in the middle of the AIDS crisis.

25:17.136 --> 25:21.301
But we started, I actually had a meeting in my... It seems to me that would be a good time to do it.

25:21.321 --> 25:29.052
There's a lot of material that you ought to be... Well, okay, but you've got people that are giving what they thought at the time, everything they had, to the AIDS crisis.

25:29.072 --> 25:29.432
I see.

25:29.665 --> 25:39.615
And you're going to come in and, as people are dying in large numbers in this city, to ask people for money for an intellectual resource.

25:39.635 --> 25:41.597
You're talking about long-term versus surviving.

25:41.617 --> 25:43.519
There's only so much water in the well, sort of.

25:43.700 --> 25:44.861
Only so much water in the well.

25:45.562 --> 25:59.436
We had a meeting in my house, about half a dozen people, including Sherry Thomas, who at that point ran Spinster's Press, a women's press.

26:00.091 --> 26:08.063
Chuck Forrester, and a guy named Jim Hormel, who is the heir of the Hormel Meet Fortune.

26:09.064 --> 26:13.571
And we kicked it around, the idea, and decided we would take it to the next step.

26:13.891 --> 26:15.874
And we organized a committee to raise money.

26:16.375 --> 26:21.262
We set aside one of the rooms in the library for the Gay and Lesbian Center.

26:21.282 --> 26:24.006
We set it on the second floor.

26:27.142 --> 26:47.179
We then figured out how much money we thought we would physically need for the center itself, which was probably $250,000 physically for the space itself, to go from just the concrete wall to build a beautiful cabinetry around it and put in a nice ceiling, what have you.

26:47.920 --> 26:57.148
But we set a goal of $1.6 million, and we decided that we would, as launching into this process,

26:57.652 --> 27:15.849
that we would give a million dollars to the capital campaign for the library, and $600,000 would be set aside for the purchase of the acquisition of materials, for preservation of materials, to begin an endowment.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.795
A million, we only needed a quarter of a million for the space.

27:22.476 --> 27:27.000
We decided to set the stage then, for anyone else who may follow,

27:27.250 --> 27:35.001
that anybody coming in to do something like this would have to put up money for the good of the whole, not just for the good of the group.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.748
Chuck Forrester came up with this idea, which I thought was great.

27:40.029 --> 27:46.719
We would make a $250,000 cash donation to the institution and have a naming opportunity for a room.

27:46.939 --> 27:56.633
The roof garden is named as a gift from the gay and lesbian community of San Francisco, for example, just as a space for people to go out and spend some time in.

27:56.984 --> 28:06.116
And the other half a million was basically paying for a percentage of bookshelves in the library, rugs, you name it.

28:06.717 --> 28:08.098
A piece of all of that.

28:08.519 --> 28:10.762
So a million dollars for that, $600,000.

28:10.942 --> 28:12.564
We've raised over $3 million.

28:12.584 --> 28:12.945
Wow.

28:13.826 --> 28:21.315
We have, basically the excess money is all in the endowment, or sitting to go in the endowment.

28:21.736 --> 28:25.641
Specifically for the Gay Lesbian Collective?

28:26.566 --> 28:31.053
The center is called the James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center.

28:31.073 --> 28:39.666
He, I gather, was a considerable patron of the— He gave us a half a million dollars out of the three million that's been raised.

28:40.006 --> 28:40.367
Wow.

28:40.387 --> 28:44.453
He took four hundred thousand, went to the center itself.

28:44.573 --> 28:50.342
A hundred thousand was set aside for the beginning of an endowment managed by the foundation.

28:50.983 --> 28:55.189
And there's to be a community-based committee.

28:55.490 --> 29:00.096
that would advise the foundation on the money that's sitting there.

29:00.116 --> 29:08.065
So it started with his $100,000, and then we have rolled in hundreds of thousands more as we went over our numbers.

29:08.325 --> 29:10.508
It's all not sitting there, but at some point it all will.

29:11.009 --> 29:15.073
The foundation has just named that committee with Hormel's OK.

29:15.614 --> 29:17.516
And we are now launching our cell.

29:18.217 --> 29:23.944
I just did a letter today to the City Life Brewery, and one of the things we've got to figure out is how a

29:24.599 --> 29:35.511
an institution that is frankly as inward-looking as this one has been for decades, how it is going to relate to these kinds of advisory groups.

29:35.531 --> 29:46.343
So the Gay and Lesbian Center, one of the letters I've got left for her, again, also we've got a look at, Barbara Greer and her collection out of Florida.

29:47.004 --> 29:53.051
She was with the lesbian Nyad.

29:53.071 --> 29:54.252
Is she Nyad Press?

29:55.750 --> 30:13.077
There was a lesbian press in San Francisco that was very, very active in the 50s, 60s, and she would have been one of the editors of one of the women's newsletters.

30:14.479 --> 30:19.547
And she had like 10,000 books in her collection, plus hundreds and thousands.

30:19.763 --> 30:29.093
We don't have the money at this point.

30:29.654 --> 30:36.382
Some of the things that are on the table, use of volunteers and the union position on volunteers is, you know, that's a dirty word.

30:38.664 --> 30:48.235
How we're going to set up the endowed money for hiring in specialized staff, and we're still, I would say,

30:48.417 --> 30:50.940
negotiating through those kinds of issues.

30:51.381 --> 30:54.725
The new interim city librarian will be involved in some of that.

30:54.805 --> 30:57.428
I think she's going to be very, very successful at that.

30:58.409 --> 31:10.163
So we're trying to set up what literally would be an international center for gay and lesbian material, both an archive and materials center.

31:10.544 --> 31:12.206
You walk up into the second floor.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.968
I think the room is quite handsome.

31:15.229 --> 31:16.551
I think you'll probably agree.

31:16.818 --> 31:18.700
It has a slightly domed ceiling.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.545
You'll see a lovely mural in the ceiling.

31:22.565 --> 31:24.127
How was that last year?

31:24.147 --> 31:24.667
Okay.

31:25.068 --> 31:27.911
And it's a very, very popular room.

31:28.191 --> 31:34.339
We've gone through five or six little sign-in books or more, and some of them are very, very moving.

31:34.359 --> 31:46.073
It's also the first vandalism that was done in the new main library was done in that room when someone with a knife carved kill fags into the piece of furniture.

31:46.093 --> 31:46.453
Wonderful.

31:46.754 --> 31:49.336
That's almost the kind of thing you want to keep, though.

31:49.356 --> 31:49.637
Almost.

31:49.677 --> 31:52.740
I mean, they sanded it out, but I thought it was perfect.

31:53.060 --> 31:55.242
Well, it's a cultural thing.

31:55.322 --> 31:59.386
Yeah, I called Jim Harmel on it, and he says, you know, Steve, we're in their face.

32:00.467 --> 32:01.187
I would expect it.

32:02.208 --> 32:04.410
So anyway, that's the Gay and Lesbian Center.

32:04.431 --> 32:14.160
We then launched... I had called in a plan that we really tried to pull some of our resources out and get them out.

32:14.180 --> 32:15.681
I was quite taken with...

32:16.454 --> 32:22.822
the Librarian of Congress, Jim Billington, did a number of speeches.

32:23.283 --> 32:37.902
He was here once, heard him talking about getting the champagne out of the bottle, and this is the people's, this referred to the Library of Congress as a people's institution, should be a working institution, should be one that's going to, you know, do things for the American public.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.285
And I thought that just absolutely

32:40.771 --> 32:51.126
fit what I wanted to see with this library system, the idea of getting the treasures of the library out there into the public so they could do more with them in an organized fashion.

32:51.827 --> 32:56.012
The Dan Lesbian Center was clearly the creation of one, a community that was not served.

32:57.114 --> 32:59.638
We talked about doing other kinds of things.

32:59.718 --> 33:06.547
I wanted to see a marriage between the library and the African American Historical Society here in San Francisco.

33:07.709 --> 33:08.550
We created

33:08.716 --> 33:11.559
eventually an African-American center.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.363
So you'll see centers basically within the library.

33:14.383 --> 33:18.988
This was how we organized, how we did some of our fundraising, but also a way of bringing the community in.

33:19.449 --> 33:25.796
Gay and lesbian, African-American, Filipino-American, Chinese-American, environmentalist, and children.

33:25.816 --> 33:27.778
You run the risk of something like that.

33:27.798 --> 33:28.780
I'm a Greek-American.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.943
I might say, hey, you've got a lot of agnos as a Greek.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.365
And this is what I would tell you.

33:33.745 --> 33:34.466
This is what I'd tell you.

33:34.486 --> 33:38.571
First, are we not serving your community in any meaningful way now?

33:39.631 --> 33:44.676
Are you a large percentage of the population that we could do some programming with?

33:45.417 --> 33:55.727
Would you be willing as a community to work with us and organize that community financially and intellectually to bring in resources?

33:55.747 --> 34:00.832
And if you answered to all of those yes, I would say, well, we need to sit down and talk.

34:01.192 --> 34:09.520
If there are only 500 Greek Americans in San Francisco and we already have a substantial collection, then I would probably say,

34:09.736 --> 34:12.779
Do we need to do more on that?

34:12.799 --> 34:18.786
But do you think a library should be getting involved in this, in that kind of community relations?

34:19.306 --> 34:20.407
Yes, absolutely.

34:20.708 --> 34:28.416
I think this city is one that is very proud of its diversity.

34:29.016 --> 34:34.402
It believes in inclusiveness almost in a militant sense.

34:35.763 --> 34:37.245
It wants to see

34:38.137 --> 34:47.013
This celebration of diversity within the city, and you're seeing the minorities within San Francisco really coming in to an age of their own.

34:48.255 --> 34:52.242
Willie Brown, as mayor, really just caps that.

34:52.362 --> 35:00.617
And his view on diversity, we will find people of talent in all streams of society, and they will all take part within government.

35:02.285 --> 35:04.567
We see these as honorific centers.

35:04.647 --> 35:10.133
I mean, the gay and lesbian collection is not housed in the gay and lesbian center.

35:10.153 --> 35:13.596
It is a place, and it was the first.

35:13.696 --> 35:25.388
The idea was that when you come into the library, you know, the confused teenager trying to figure out his sexuality or hers.

35:26.609 --> 35:32.275
Here's a room in a government institution that says, we value the gay and lesbian community.

35:33.098 --> 35:36.862
or if they go online and pull up resources from that.

35:37.683 --> 35:39.505
It's a way of making a political statement.

35:40.145 --> 35:46.112
It's a way of serving kids that are not being served in most libraries in America.

35:46.152 --> 36:02.008
Some of the donations that came in, some of the people who told the stories as we were fundraising were, you know, as I was a boy growing up in Wisconsin or Maine or anyplace else, you know, you never—you wanted to find a book about

36:02.360 --> 36:15.437
what it was like to be homosexual, you would find either very narrow medical kinds of references to it as a disease, or something religious putting it down.

36:16.118 --> 36:18.081
Very difficult to find a lot of materials.

36:18.601 --> 36:22.346
That was Hormel's story, talking about when he was growing up as a boy.

36:23.047 --> 36:24.750
Where did he grow up?

36:24.770 --> 36:25.551
Where did Hormel grow up?

36:25.811 --> 36:28.354
I mean, that was a Hormel plant out in Des Moines, Iowa.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.616
That wouldn't be his.

36:30.102 --> 36:31.524
Well, he's Hormel Mead Family.

36:31.644 --> 36:32.165
He's the heir.

36:32.205 --> 36:33.847
So he's from the Midwest someplace?

36:33.867 --> 36:35.829
Someplace, yeah.

36:35.849 --> 36:37.191
But we heard that from a lot of people.

36:37.211 --> 36:38.472
I was trying to think of the one guy's name.

36:38.973 --> 36:49.166
The guy that, the actor, Sir, British actor, did Shakespearean actor.

36:49.206 --> 36:50.327
Not Ian McKellen.

36:50.928 --> 36:51.909
Yeah.

36:51.929 --> 36:52.430
He was here.

36:53.691 --> 36:57.897
He gave us one of his books that he did a forward on for the collection.

36:58.257 --> 36:58.978
He did a

36:59.313 --> 37:12.813
a donor prospect meeting where he talked about what it was like in England growing up and what it was like to be a gay man, you know, 45 years ago trying to figure out who you were and why a library was so important.

37:12.833 --> 37:16.058
I mean, there were hundreds of those kinds of stories about what that would mean.

37:16.358 --> 37:24.951
So as a point of pride within that community nationally, I think we've really established something that really speaks out.

37:25.672 --> 37:26.333
And it's not...

37:26.785 --> 37:28.588
compartmentalizing.

37:28.628 --> 37:32.634
It's not saying that gay stuff is all here.

37:32.714 --> 37:36.279
I mean, it is mainstream within the institution.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.564
We have just chosen to highlight certain aspects of it.

37:39.665 --> 37:40.766
Well, you built the collection.

37:41.167 --> 37:41.628
Let's see.

37:41.668 --> 37:45.794
I mean, I'm actually going to ask to see what you have in the collection.

37:45.814 --> 37:51.122
You know, I mean, it's one thing to have the center, but let's see what— You want to talk to Jim Van Buskirk?

37:51.592 --> 37:57.077
He is assigned by the library as the director of the Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center.

37:57.658 --> 37:58.839
Jim Van Buzzkirk.

38:01.421 --> 38:05.165
And I would say we're still in our growing pains for making everything happen.

38:05.625 --> 38:17.256
But we have done, even before we opened, we did three lecture series with the authors, gay and lesbian authors, coming into town as part of the Friends lecture series.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.658
We basically subcontracted off their contract.

38:20.060 --> 38:26.009
We just did a series with PFLAG, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, with authors.

38:27.772 --> 38:31.898
He's done a couple of exhibits around Gay Pride Month.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.322
You know, we walk in the Gay Lesbian Parade.

38:35.103 --> 38:37.807
There's a bookmobile out there, and people go crazy over it.

38:38.368 --> 38:47.181
What I would like to see us do, and these are some things we're talking about, is starting to look at private staffing coming in.

38:47.549 --> 38:54.480
I wouldn't mind seeing us do something that would be a visiting research professor kind of thing.

38:54.521 --> 39:00.090
You wouldn't call a professor, but someone who would come in and maybe be doing research in a certain area.

39:00.110 --> 39:02.834
There's publications that they might get involved with.

39:03.976 --> 39:14.113
Maybe we would be putting together, convening meetings within the gay and lesbian community of writers or publishers or what have you.

39:14.566 --> 39:17.290
And not unlike what Schaumburg has tried to do.

39:17.470 --> 39:18.993
You've got to look at us in our infancy.

39:19.033 --> 39:24.722
Don't forget, Schaumburg started as the private collection of author Alfonso Schaumburg.

39:24.782 --> 39:24.982
Right.

39:25.042 --> 39:28.628
And then his collection was a combination prayer.

39:28.648 --> 39:29.930
I mean, I wrote about it in my book.

39:30.030 --> 39:30.791
Right.

39:30.811 --> 39:33.255
And you'll see, like, the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society.

39:33.275 --> 39:37.842
But that's really the, you know, the creation of one man's vision.

39:38.302 --> 39:38.603
Right.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.008
And we are, we have a vision.

39:42.680 --> 39:50.352
We think his vision was—the vision of the New York public and what they did at the Schaumburg Center is a good one.

39:50.672 --> 39:57.863
But it's a discrete, meaning it's complete, and it's by itself.

39:58.364 --> 39:59.867
Now, you mentioned going to Boston.

40:00.568 --> 40:06.497
Boston had its old beautiful library, 1851 or something, and they built another one next door.

40:06.877 --> 40:09.261
You here in San Francisco decided to totally

40:09.950 --> 40:13.554
I mean, like a fire, as somebody said, wouldn't have been such a bad thing.

40:13.594 --> 40:15.276
I mean, obviously we're exaggerating.

40:15.336 --> 40:17.619
It would have been easy to have lost all your collections.

40:17.679 --> 40:25.969
But why build a totally new structure and get rid of the old one, especially now that, you know, you don't have room for all your books?

40:26.770 --> 40:29.493
Well, the issue on that was just a political issue.

40:29.513 --> 40:34.799
The building of the new main library meant that you got rid of the old one.

40:35.220 --> 40:39.805
And before whatever went on the ballot, there was a deal struck politically with

40:40.207 --> 40:44.273
It said the Asian Art Museum would come in the Old Main Library.

40:44.293 --> 40:46.918
That was the deal that was cut politically.

40:46.938 --> 40:52.326
They're moving out of the park, coming in, and will renovate the Old Main Library.

40:52.727 --> 40:56.753
The new Main Library will be built, and the library will move its collection from one side to the next.

40:56.773 --> 40:56.954
Yeah.

40:56.974 --> 41:02.042
And, you know, this is, the British Library is moving from the British Museum to St.

41:02.062 --> 41:04.746
Pancras, where they visited in March.

41:05.047 --> 41:09.773
And, of course, they would love to keep that wonderful old reading room, you know, which is historic.

41:09.793 --> 41:12.776
I mean, that's what Karl Marx did his work, and Schad did his work.

41:13.377 --> 41:18.923
But, you know, that's already been promised to the British Museum to do something else.

41:19.003 --> 41:25.031
I mean, this is not totally without precedent, what you're doing here.

41:25.071 --> 41:31.358
Let's get into the problems, you know, that I've read about and heard about and which have, you know,

41:31.827 --> 41:34.550
What happened over there?

41:34.610 --> 41:43.700
I mean, I saw a tape, somebody sent me a tape called The Future Library that was done, I think, even here, in 1987 or 1988.

41:43.720 --> 41:52.870
And, you know, this was, Ken Dowling has quoted on that tape saying, we'll have room for two and a half million books.

41:52.950 --> 42:00.298
So clearly, when you were planning this library, you were not only planning to house your existing collection, but

42:01.139 --> 42:09.511
to accommodate materials that you would be acquiring, I would assume, for the next 30, 40, or 50 years, or even beyond.

42:09.931 --> 42:12.715
Was that part of the original equation?

42:12.855 --> 42:13.236
Oh, I mean, yeah.

42:13.256 --> 42:19.565
I mean, there's two and a half acres of floor space that's not there, based on a budget decision made by the city when they put the issue on the ballot.

42:20.746 --> 42:30.420
We lost one of our floors, the whole basement level, about the size of Brooks Hall, basically, which you probably will see on the

42:30.738 --> 42:43.855
Wednesday, I think is when you go home, was lost out of the budget because the guy on the Board of Supervisors Finance Committee said, a bond issue over $100 million is too big, nobody will ever pass it.

42:45.097 --> 42:48.841
So we're going to take $20 million out of the proposal.

42:48.962 --> 42:51.785
We needed $125 million or something like that.

42:52.426 --> 42:55.410
And they said, no, I'm not going to do that.

42:55.530 --> 42:59.395
And then they wrangled around a bit, and this was after the architectural

42:59.999 --> 43:04.664
Feasibility study had been done that said how much space was needed for the Humane Library.

43:04.684 --> 43:10.952
And basically one guy made the decision, the chair of the committee, and said it's too much.

43:10.972 --> 43:11.292
Who was that?

43:11.312 --> 43:12.374
That would have been Molinari.

43:12.994 --> 43:13.735
Jack Molinari.

43:14.436 --> 43:17.540
Ran for mayor and lost to Art Agnos.

43:19.021 --> 43:22.826
And they ended up compromising.

43:23.146 --> 43:25.369
They did $109.5 million.

43:26.210 --> 43:29.854
Five million was to go to the branches for some renovation.

43:30.307 --> 43:38.537
so that they could get neighborhood support, and $104.5 million for the new main library, but we needed $125 million.

43:40.239 --> 43:48.950
So they started off by creating a very difficult situation when the bond issue passed, and I wasn't even involved in the library at the time.

43:49.471 --> 43:58.322
So this is all stories that have been told to me so many times, though, that I think they're pretty accurate in giving the people who told me the stories.

43:59.720 --> 44:09.449
So we ended up looking at what the need was for the building, and there was just no feasible way of building it, you know, the second basement level.

44:10.110 --> 44:12.732
And so we took out two-and-a-half acres' worth of storage.

44:14.433 --> 44:15.815
Why was it storage that had to go?

44:15.855 --> 44:19.498
Well, you know, two-and-a-half acres had to be below ground.

44:19.518 --> 44:22.101
I go in and I see this really beautiful building, I have to say.

44:22.121 --> 44:22.741
It's striking.

44:22.961 --> 44:23.822
That's a gorgeous building.

44:24.142 --> 44:29.187
Gorgeous, but I also say, you know, 340,000 square feet

44:29.673 --> 44:32.056
whatever the number is.

44:32.878 --> 44:35.642
A lot of this could be shelf space.

44:35.662 --> 44:36.002
It could.

44:36.022 --> 44:45.756
I mean, we've had arguments with some people who came up and said, you should get rid of the atrium, you should be, you know, nothing but wall-to-wall bookcases.

44:45.776 --> 44:54.149
I've seen that in the, you know, when you go into a place, well, like the Pompidou Center in Paris.

44:54.910 --> 44:56.232
I think it's depressing as hell.

44:56.692 --> 44:57.233
It gets...

44:57.584 --> 45:06.396
massive amount of use, but as a physical space, I just find it a low ceiling and not inviting in.

45:08.158 --> 45:13.485
And we did not want a claustrophobic space within the library.

45:14.387 --> 45:18.071
And we wanted one that was inviting and would pull people into the institution.

45:18.492 --> 45:26.663
We knew we had a problem on ceiling space, to do seven levels within what there are basically three in the old library.

45:27.082 --> 45:33.509
But you couldn't go up any higher, because we had physical boundaries as to the width, the length, and the height.

45:34.350 --> 45:50.108
We also—the reason it cost so much money to do the second basement was you're dealing in a very sandy, difficult, underground river environment in Civic Center, and enormously expensive to go down.

45:50.228 --> 45:52.571
That's what you needed the big bucks for, to do that.

45:52.591 --> 45:56.515
Well, the French library is next to the River Seine, too, and they can only go down.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.583
That's one of the reasons they went way up.

45:59.783 --> 46:01.906
But we could not go up.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.488
We could not go up.

46:03.528 --> 46:05.830
That did not fit the master plan.

46:05.871 --> 46:16.022
We could have a building 200 feet long, 200 by 300 feet by 80 feet.

46:16.363 --> 46:20.568
That is what the shell had to be, and then as deep as you could afford to go down.

46:20.928 --> 46:22.870
So that was certainly one of the problems.

46:24.352 --> 46:26.755
There were also

46:27.038 --> 46:44.297
some decisions made on—as we started putting shelves in place—not putting them in place as we're doing the designing that would deal with the space—decisions made here and there for different decisions, which took away a lot of shelf space.

46:44.758 --> 46:51.485
We had the Americans with Disability Act was passed in the middle of the design process.

46:52.066 --> 46:55.510
No rules and regulations, but that created

46:56.620 --> 47:14.989
great concern as to what we were going to do or not do to be seen as in compliance with what was going to be a very complex law, and how we would deal with people in wheelchairs, the width of the shelves, how high the shelves would be, how we were going to get people from one floor to another, how wide your aisleways had to be.

47:15.009 --> 47:23.202
A whole lot of issues went in that were very complicated, and we had to work our way through on that.

47:24.818 --> 47:26.821
There were a lot of issues that went in.

47:27.602 --> 47:35.434
There was also an assumption, of course, that the library, there would be some management of the collection.

47:35.454 --> 47:42.504
And basically, weeding has been something that has not happened in the city because there's been no money for new books.

47:42.564 --> 47:53.560
So no matter whether a book has ever been checked out in the history of the library, the history of the book on the shelf, whether it's totally falling apart, whether it's covered in mud,

47:53.877 --> 47:56.180
And a vicinity is you kept it on the shelf.

47:57.141 --> 47:58.803
You did not weed your collections.

47:59.664 --> 48:15.082
And there was always a sense that with some reasonable weeding within the institution, like other public libraries would do, that that would make the collection a whole lot more manageable.

48:15.463 --> 48:23.192
They were also looking at a collection that was going to grow at about a million dollars a year in new materials.

48:23.982 --> 48:29.009
And before the new Maine even opened, suddenly we bought $4.5 million worth of new materials.

48:29.069 --> 48:34.397
Then another $3.5 million, and $3.5 million going forward for a number of years.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.299
So suddenly there's a huge influx of materials.

48:36.860 --> 48:44.391
We made decisions on things like the Gay and Lesbian Center, some of the other collections that started people making available.

48:44.811 --> 48:52.622
We decided we would bring those into the institution and then figure out how we would find the space and do what needed to be done with them.

48:53.024 --> 48:55.867
So you've got Brooks Hall over there.

48:56.048 --> 48:59.192
What's the solution to that, and those books that are down there?

48:59.212 --> 49:00.713
What's the long-term solution?

49:00.753 --> 49:04.638
You've got about four or five different categories of materials there.

49:04.939 --> 49:06.821
You've got what they call the city archives.

49:07.662 --> 49:11.767
And they're in Brooks Hall, and they should probably be in the new main, right?

49:11.787 --> 49:13.269
Well, you've got to understand what that means.

49:14.550 --> 49:20.938
When they closed the old city hall and decided what they were going to do with everything, everything had to come out.

49:21.458 --> 49:27.766
And it was decided, well, the library is officially, according to statute, the city archive.

49:28.327 --> 49:32.211
So that meant that anything anybody's got, ship it to the library.

49:33.092 --> 49:36.557
So we have got massive amounts of stuff.

49:37.398 --> 49:42.845
Nobody knows what it is, whether it's any good or not, and it'll probably be years before anybody can even look at it.

49:42.865 --> 49:46.209
So that's one category of stuff when you go down there, of our stuff.

49:46.229 --> 49:51.075
There's also, I reckon Park has got a bunch of stuff down there, which is not ours.

49:51.095 --> 49:51.195
Park.

49:51.968 --> 49:58.196
So you've got archives, and God knows—I mean, that's self-defined as everybody who had a box of style.

49:58.897 --> 50:17.222
You've got 10,000 to 15,000 books that were sitting in storage after the earthquake of 89 that were put in storage elsewhere, because the earthquake in 89 really destroyed the seven-level stacks in the old main library.

50:17.242 --> 50:19.866
They were considered brilliant for 1918.

50:20.150 --> 50:27.898
They were glass-floored steel, seven-level single set of book stacks.

50:27.918 --> 50:35.466
And in the earthquake, they twisted the whole seven levels of it, and you had huge shards of glass and a million book stumps on the floor.

50:36.247 --> 50:37.208
They all had to come out.

50:37.828 --> 50:46.377
And we actually had to do it with volunteers to go in, because to even pull materials out, it was pretty amazing walking in some of those

50:47.099 --> 50:54.188
some of those spaces with literally four-foot shards of glass sticking up, and you've got to walk in, and the whole thing is not secure.

50:54.549 --> 50:58.173
So no one could be asked to go in there, but employees could volunteer to go in.

50:58.594 --> 51:04.061
And then they re-hooked it up, redid the thing, and the public could never go into those stacks again.

51:04.902 --> 51:09.908
And a lot of the stuff was just left on storage out in the Presidio, in one of the big hospitals out there.

51:09.928 --> 51:15.115
We got Congresswoman Boxer at the time, then Senator Boxer, to help us with that.

51:15.820 --> 51:22.250
Those 10,000 or 15,000 last pieces came in, but they were not cataloged under the online system.

51:22.270 --> 51:26.276
They were not taken part in part of the inventory that went on.

51:26.657 --> 51:29.201
So there's an inventory going on now with those.

51:29.281 --> 51:31.244
They're being cataloged.

51:31.304 --> 51:37.373
Almost all of those will be moved into the new main library this month.

51:37.393 --> 51:38.796
And then how about future?

51:38.816 --> 51:44.224
But the other stuff that's down there, you've also got the Hormel collections.

51:44.575 --> 51:46.237
There are 10,000 books that I mentioned.

51:46.577 --> 51:50.581
The Dorothy Star collection, which was a sheet music collection.

51:50.801 --> 51:51.922
Down in Brooks.

51:52.022 --> 51:52.483
Brooks Hall.

51:53.264 --> 52:08.799
You've got the bound periodicals, which is the majority of the stuff that's in Brooks Hall in terms of bound materials, which, frankly, need to be looked at for even its relevance to San Francisco.

52:08.839 --> 52:12.523
Some of it, yes, the old newspaper clips and that kind of stuff.

52:12.790 --> 52:15.394
And a lot of it needs to find a home within the system.

52:15.895 --> 52:19.060
A lot of it probably needs to find a home someplace else.

52:19.120 --> 52:23.046
Stuff that it's unclear why we ever collected it.

52:23.387 --> 52:30.157
For example, you will go down there and you will find every issue of, what, National Cement News?

52:30.478 --> 52:31.680
Is that what the name of it?

52:31.700 --> 52:39.692
There's a whole series of magazines dealing with the cement industry in the 50s and 60s, some of them even in the 40s.

52:40.043 --> 52:45.832
And there's dozens and dozens of big bound volumes, and you look at it and you think, why do we have that?

52:46.633 --> 52:53.444
There's a whole huge set of Canadian medical magazines from the fifties.

52:53.464 --> 52:58.893
And again, you look at that and say, one, it's probably hopelessly outdated.

52:59.534 --> 53:06.625
What if it turned out, just as a hypothetical, that you had the only run of national cement news?

53:06.807 --> 53:12.714
And we'd say, is there a library that specializes in the cement industry?

53:12.894 --> 53:14.296
And then maybe you will give it to them.

53:14.316 --> 53:14.956
Give it to them.

53:15.057 --> 53:16.678
If they want it.

53:16.718 --> 53:16.999
Yeah.

53:17.019 --> 53:19.822
I think we'd try to find a home for it.

53:19.842 --> 53:30.194
Or, and you'd look at the other thing that we're in the conversation with, you look at the big storage facilities that UC Berkeley Library and others have.

53:30.895 --> 53:32.697
Could we take part in some of those?

53:33.200 --> 53:39.165
where we would share materials more with some of the other libraries and store some of our stuff.

53:39.185 --> 53:58.163
And if you've got materials down there that say no one has checked out and they've been in the collection since 1930, are they really worth taking space in an institution that admittedly is short on space, or should they be someplace else where someone could have access to it?

53:58.183 --> 53:59.204
So what's your take on that?

53:59.364 --> 54:00.625
What's your view on that?

54:01.280 --> 54:04.603
This is an issue I'm looking into in my book.

54:04.623 --> 54:04.883
Yeah.

54:05.364 --> 54:08.887
I mean, this is part of one of the challenges that we have.

54:10.228 --> 54:11.630
Let me come back to this.

54:11.650 --> 54:12.911
The final piece of stuff.

54:12.931 --> 54:13.772
It's a very important issue.

54:13.792 --> 54:13.972
Right.

54:14.072 --> 54:22.580
The final piece of stuff that's in the old, in Brooks Hall, are books that professional librarians have weeded from the collection and are a waiting process.

54:23.201 --> 54:29.527
So those are about the five areas of things that you will see in there of stuff that belongs to the library.

54:29.587 --> 54:30.848
And that's another set of issues.

54:31.283 --> 54:36.471
One of the issues we've got to deal with is just defining what is a core service and what kind of library are we?

54:36.952 --> 54:45.265
We thought we had done that in 1990 and 91 when we did a whole series of public hearings on the library.

54:45.285 --> 54:49.872
In fact, let's see if I can find one of mine.

54:51.895 --> 54:55.741
Series of public hearings trying to put together a five-year plan.

54:55.761 --> 54:56.522
The library commission.

54:56.542 --> 54:58.505
The library commission, yeah.

54:58.525 --> 54:59.687
As to what we were going to be,

55:00.292 --> 55:02.335
You know, are we a research library?

55:02.395 --> 55:04.198
Are we a public materials library?

55:04.939 --> 55:08.484
And we thought we were cutting somewhere in the middle.

55:09.025 --> 55:19.099
We are basically a public materials library, you know, where public comes in and they're looking for the newer kinds of materials, the reading, what have you.

55:19.540 --> 55:26.350
You've got a solid collection for kids doing their homework and college kids coming in and people doing...

55:26.684 --> 55:33.834
business work, like our business collection has always been very, very popular with the small business community and the small investors in San Francisco.

55:34.495 --> 55:40.043
We would take some collections where we would see ourselves as going to research depth.

55:40.483 --> 55:41.545
They'd be very narrow.

55:41.985 --> 55:44.249
Well, like a gay lesbian collection.

55:44.309 --> 55:45.751
San Francisco history.

55:45.811 --> 55:55.965
San Francisco history, gay and lesbian, where there was, in the case of some of the newer ones, like gay and lesbian, where we could develop private support.

55:56.317 --> 56:00.023
on top of the basic service that the city would provide.

56:00.944 --> 56:04.830
Something like San Francisco history, we would see that is a basic service.

56:04.850 --> 56:14.145
We would look at ourselves as being one of the best depositories for any kind of material in San Francisco history and not necessarily looking for private money for that.

56:14.606 --> 56:22.999
But as we built other special collections out there, we would look at private money making a big difference in terms of

56:23.266 --> 56:27.252
what you could collect and manage any programs that you would do.

56:27.772 --> 56:32.259
There seems to be a difference of opinion with some people.

56:32.920 --> 56:46.219
I have one woman regularly at every commission meeting who stands up and says, every book, every magazine, any piece of paper, any piece of information that you get, you should save and always keep it.

56:46.239 --> 56:50.505
And you talk about what the Library of Congress's role is, and they don't do that.

56:51.076 --> 56:53.239
And yet there are people who say, we should.

56:53.780 --> 56:59.208
We should take on the role of being the National Library of America from a San Francisco perspective.

56:59.228 --> 57:03.795
Every book, no matter how many copies of Daniel Steele you've got, you keep it.

57:03.815 --> 57:05.558
Well, that's a ridiculous position.

57:05.578 --> 57:07.521
But that is where some of the people come from.

57:07.882 --> 57:12.348
And there are others who come and say, I don't care about all the book collection.

57:12.408 --> 57:17.396
I want lapsed programs for my kid, you know, for three-year-olds or five-year-olds.

57:17.456 --> 57:20.020
I want, you know, children's books.

57:20.337 --> 57:27.567
I want your libraries open certain hours so my wife and I can go do something.

57:27.947 --> 57:32.273
You end up with quite a range of views on a public library.

57:32.313 --> 57:33.114
It's a public library.

57:33.134 --> 57:33.675
Public library.

57:33.935 --> 57:35.798
So you try to figure out how to accommodate that.

57:36.218 --> 57:44.650
I thought we had reached a reasonable conclusion publicly, but obviously not everyone had bought in on it, and that created some of the problems when we opened.

57:46.051 --> 57:48.775
Part of the problem we opened, we went from $2,500 a day

57:49.379 --> 57:56.609
2,500 people a day at the Old Main Library on a good day, to 14,000 a day on opening day, and it lasted two months at 14,000.

57:56.649 --> 58:03.058
Then it started going down a little bit to 12,000, and now we're sitting between six and seven a day, seven days a week.

58:03.078 --> 58:04.480
So you're still getting six or seven.

58:04.540 --> 58:12.211
So you think that then, by itself, is a validation of the library, then?

58:12.231 --> 58:13.573
The fact that you're getting this now?

58:13.593 --> 58:17.158
We're getting huge crowds, and they keep coming back, and people seem to love it.

58:17.198 --> 58:18.880
It's a popular destination.

58:19.248 --> 58:23.694
Well, and so, you know, Starbucks at Barnes & Noble is, too.

58:23.714 --> 58:29.321
Are they going there for books, or are they going there for, you know, 7,000 visitors?

58:29.982 --> 58:30.723
Great, you know.

58:32.345 --> 58:38.954
I guess if they were coming in and taking pictures and walking out, and that was the majority of them, that would be one thing.

58:38.974 --> 58:41.717
How do you know, 7,000 people walking through the door?

58:41.857 --> 58:44.301
That's what our counters indicate, yeah.

58:44.321 --> 58:47.685
So whether or not they're reading books or doing it?

58:48.205 --> 58:52.509
There's no way of gauging the activities that they're doing.

58:52.529 --> 58:57.413
You can certainly look at your checkout numbers, and our numbers are way, way up.

58:57.493 --> 58:58.874
That's a good thing.

58:58.974 --> 59:00.295
I think I'll ask about that, yeah.

59:00.635 --> 59:06.420
We started to do the online stuff and then decided we couldn't depend on the numbers.

59:07.601 --> 59:18.010
But there was, last October, I got a number that was, what, 250,000 people in October of last year had dialed into our website and into the

59:19.205 --> 59:21.949
We thought it was a pretty astounding number.

59:22.489 --> 59:29.278
Then the technical people decided it was not dependable enough, and so they pulled that sort of stuff back.

59:29.298 --> 59:33.423
But, and we've not been able to count that kind of usage, but it is big.

59:34.545 --> 59:39.010
The popularity, certainly, of our Internet access is big.

59:39.411 --> 59:42.455
The popularity of our workstations is big.

59:43.136 --> 59:48.823
You walk in the library, and I've walked in hundreds of times, you will see people doing a little bit of everything.

59:49.276 --> 59:56.206
people on tables throughout the library sitting there reading, whether it's periodicals or books, a lot of that.

59:56.546 --> 59:58.770
Clearly a lot of kids doing their homework.

59:58.790 --> 01:00:10.967
We have small rooms, because I like what New York Public had done, where they had authors' rooms where you could go and basically check out a room for a period of time and do your research.

01:00:11.348 --> 01:00:12.930
You will see we have those all over.

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:18.658
We have not really developed that, though, with the literary community yet, but you'll see kids go in and do studies.

01:00:18.858 --> 01:00:21.921
They're glass shelves, glass wall rooms.

01:00:21.941 --> 01:00:25.745
You'll see them five or six on almost every floor.

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:31.690
But you'll see kids doing their homework in there, doing language sessions, what have you.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:37.456
And you'll see people doing just about everything, I think, when you walk in the library.

01:00:38.077 --> 01:00:42.161
Plus, you know, wandering through the shelves, you'll see all kinds of people doing that.

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:45.604
I mean, I think people are using it as a library.

01:00:45.644 --> 01:00:48.747
I think it's also a popular meeting place.

01:00:49.317 --> 01:00:50.578
You know, a research place.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:01:06.477
And as we work through the growing pains of going from a very tired, old, limited library to one that's trying to dramatically expand its scope, its scale, and the types of services it's providing, it's been tough.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:12.504
I mean, the cultural change alone on going from where we were to where we are has been tremendous.

01:01:12.824 --> 01:01:15.207
And some of the staff has been really resistant.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.363
And the union has led that.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.126
And how do you justify it?

01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:21.811
You know, we've got to get into that, I think, at some point.

01:01:23.374 --> 01:01:24.856
There is resistance from the staff.

01:01:25.137 --> 01:01:25.898
Some of the staff.

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:28.483
I'm not, you know, going to be coy.

01:01:28.523 --> 01:01:30.547
Of course, I've been talking to some of them.

01:01:30.567 --> 01:01:39.743
You know, you've been talking to Annette McNair and Kathy Bremer, who's the chief steward.

01:01:40.381 --> 01:01:41.803
Oh, God, who else?

01:01:42.184 --> 01:01:43.325
I'm not going to tell you a little bit.

01:01:43.345 --> 01:01:43.606
Sure.

01:01:43.726 --> 01:01:46.851
But, I mean, I know who Steve you've been talking to.

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:48.533
It shouldn't be difficult for you to figure it out.

01:01:48.553 --> 01:01:48.774
No, no.

01:01:48.794 --> 01:02:09.865
I mean, the union position, when we asked them how to save money on the budget, this was when Dowling, just before Dowling left the system, was get rid of volunteers, get rid of private money, get rid of the book budget if it gets in the way of salaries.

01:02:10.368 --> 01:02:11.709
get rid of the technology.

01:02:14.172 --> 01:02:18.196
I mean, it was the most Luddite, backward proposal I have ever seen.

01:02:18.636 --> 01:02:20.057
The newspapers dumped on them.

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:23.841
Even some of the gadflies that normally come were just up in arms on them.

01:02:24.342 --> 01:02:27.004
And the union at the next meeting withdrew their proposal.

01:02:27.865 --> 01:02:31.348
And they proposed, if you had to lay off people, lay them off in one of the other unions.

01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:35.072
That's where the Librarian Guild came from.

01:02:35.092 --> 01:02:36.353
And it was an embarrassment.

01:02:36.974 --> 01:02:40.257
I thought it was an absolute embarrassment.

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:45.842
The guy that heads, he's not a steward, but he's responsible.
