WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:04.894
started at the beginning.

00:05.214 --> 00:07.457
This is Noah Gordon.

00:07.477 --> 00:09.620
This is Noah Gordon.

00:09.780 --> 00:18.950
I'm talking about my wife's experience with publishing as my wife.

00:19.110 --> 00:23.736
I think it was 1963, a long time ago.

00:24.617 --> 00:28.581
I had an idea for my first novel that I really wanted to write.

00:28.801 --> 00:29.983
You were married in 1963?

00:30.183 --> 00:31.945
Oh, I was married in...

00:32.127 --> 00:34.330
I was married in 51.

00:36.173 --> 00:37.274
I'm an old guy.

00:37.294 --> 00:38.576
I'm 69 years old.

00:39.357 --> 00:39.658
Wow.

00:39.958 --> 00:44.325
And so happy to be... 45 years this year.

00:44.345 --> 00:44.986
Yeah.

00:45.006 --> 00:46.448
Oh, yeah.

00:46.648 --> 00:58.405
And so happy to be not only married to Lorraine Gordon, but writing still, you know, and more important, wanting to write, because I remember...

00:59.296 --> 01:21.217
One particular friend, he better remain nameless, he's a well-known magazine writer, or was, and he told me at one point, no, in your late 40s, you're reaching towards 50, you lose that creative energy, you know, and the desire, and it's pretty much all over.

01:22.138 --> 01:23.819
I haven't lost that.

01:23.839 --> 01:24.840
I couldn't disagree more.

01:24.980 --> 01:25.741
I haven't lost that.

01:25.761 --> 01:28.864
I get up every morning, if I wake up at 2 o'clock,

01:29.333 --> 01:35.641
I lie there and I'm probably thinking about a character that's been giving me some problems and solving it in bed, you know.

01:36.122 --> 01:41.488
And I get up in the morning and I'm happy to be able to sit down and write, you know.

01:41.508 --> 01:43.531
So I feel very lucky.

01:43.631 --> 01:45.994
I really do.

01:46.134 --> 01:54.885
And I hope, well, that little speech I'm going to give you indicates that

01:55.203 --> 01:59.249
When I finished this last book, it's just coming out in America.

01:59.790 --> 02:00.972
And that's because of here.

02:01.252 --> 02:01.473
Yeah.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.354
Matters of Choice.

02:02.434 --> 02:03.255
Matters of Choice.

02:04.217 --> 02:12.209
I had a couple of ideas, but they weren't anything that, you know, that made me burn to write them.

02:13.291 --> 02:21.403
And so I kicked them around and Lorraine said, you know, Noah, all of our friends are retiring or retired.

02:21.423 --> 02:23.927
And why don't, you know,

02:24.262 --> 02:25.404
Why don't you think about it?

02:25.424 --> 02:34.238
I had a really interesting time as a reporter and as a writer, but I have a lot of interest.

02:34.419 --> 02:35.280
I love to garden.

02:35.320 --> 02:39.327
I like to fish and do other things.

02:39.607 --> 02:42.252
I said, maybe it's time.

02:43.093 --> 02:46.118
I was very seriously thinking about it.

02:46.756 --> 02:52.683
My publisher in Spain, which is Ediciones Bay, is the name of it.

02:52.743 --> 02:57.269
Is that spelled out in some of the stuff you're going to give me?

02:57.289 --> 02:57.389
Yeah.

02:57.409 --> 02:58.931
I don't have to wrestle with it.

02:58.951 --> 03:00.452
No, no.

03:00.472 --> 03:06.800
It's E-D-I-C-I-O-N-E-S, capital B. Ediciones Bay.

03:06.820 --> 03:12.847
It's like Editions B. I don't know why they invented that.

03:12.988 --> 03:13.388
They...

03:14.093 --> 03:15.896
rushed this book into print.

03:17.117 --> 03:21.804
Over there it's called La Doctora Cole.

03:22.485 --> 03:26.592
Actually, it appears in Europe before the United States.

03:26.612 --> 03:27.954
We really must expand this.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.075
Yes, we will.

03:30.798 --> 03:37.688
This is a phenomenon with your books in general.

03:38.545 --> 03:50.832
They rushed it out, did a beautiful job, I must say, with a nice-looking book, well-produced book, and they put it out in a matter of weeks, because... Did you read Spanish?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.678
I read it, I took it to high school.

03:53.698 --> 03:55.162
So you had no way knowing whether or not they hit a good shot?

03:55.182 --> 03:57.567
No, no, no, I can't read any of the languages.

03:58.222 --> 03:59.544
I have a wall at home.

04:00.124 --> 04:06.552
I'll give you a release they put out telling the countries that are publishing there a lot.

04:07.634 --> 04:13.161
I have a wall in Ashton with all of my books, lots of editions.

04:13.941 --> 04:15.203
But here I only have a couple.

04:15.944 --> 04:26.457
But anyway, the reason Adicione's Day wanted to publish very quickly was they wanted to make something that they called National Book Day.

04:26.791 --> 04:29.275
One day a year in Spain.

04:29.295 --> 04:31.499
It's on the birthday of St.

04:31.539 --> 04:31.880
George.

04:32.321 --> 04:34.144
It's great.

04:34.184 --> 04:39.533
Let me tell you about it for a few minutes because they call it Geordie's Day.

04:39.954 --> 04:40.775
Geordie's Day.

04:41.536 --> 04:42.959
Go there, Nick.

04:42.979 --> 04:43.820
You've got to go there.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.323
You've got to go there.

04:45.792 --> 04:49.956
And you ought to publish, you ought to publish everywhere in this book.

04:50.116 --> 04:50.776
I hope so.

04:50.796 --> 04:54.640
The next book is going to be a, we'll talk about that in another time, but go ahead.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.802
Okay, I'm a minister, though, but I've seen a talk alone.

04:57.943 --> 05:01.105
It was established by Columbus's son.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.809
I've got a continuum chapter.

05:04.829 --> 05:06.970
I want to go back to the beginning.

05:07.191 --> 05:08.692
Let's not talk about it anymore.

05:08.712 --> 05:09.192
Don't get me going.

05:09.212 --> 05:10.674
Well, I'm very interested.

05:10.694 --> 05:11.975
I really am.

05:11.995 --> 05:14.837
We'll talk about Spain, wouldn't you?

05:14.857 --> 05:15.698
But what they...

05:16.403 --> 05:32.646
What they do is, I think it's centuries old tradition that on that day, men give their women a flower, usually a long red rose, and the woman gives the man a book.

05:33.187 --> 05:41.338
But now, wait, wait, it's better, it's better because in modern days, now most of the time the men give the women a book too.

05:41.358 --> 05:45.364
But the whole country, every city in the country,

05:45.580 --> 06:05.361
is taken over by this holiday and they have outdoor booths and stands on all of the wide boulevards with musicians and food vendors and flower sellers and thousands and thousands and thousands of people and at every stand

06:05.830 --> 06:07.737
An author signed his book.

06:07.757 --> 06:10.346
It is fantastic.

06:10.446 --> 06:13.075
It is absolutely, you've got to go there.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.464
You know what day they have on it?

06:15.484 --> 06:16.066
Yeah, I'll tell you.

06:16.086 --> 06:16.588
Or what month?

06:16.748 --> 06:17.511
It's in April.

06:18.048 --> 06:22.595
Is it close to Shakespeare's birthday, which is on April 23rd, I wonder?

06:22.695 --> 06:26.160
I think it may have been on Shakespeare's birthday.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.744
Oh, it was also Cervantes' birthday.

06:28.844 --> 06:30.006
It was Cervantes, same day.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.149
They both died on the same day.

06:32.210 --> 06:33.431
Oh, they both died on the same day.

06:33.451 --> 06:35.174
April 23rd, 1616.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.356
Well, anyway.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.838
Pardon me for knowing that.

06:37.858 --> 06:38.139
No, no.

06:38.259 --> 06:39.180
It's in my book.

06:40.562 --> 06:41.564
Good.

06:41.864 --> 06:43.126
I haven't finished your book.

06:43.407 --> 06:46.992
I'm really anxious to.

06:48.068 --> 06:50.892
Anyway, so this was marvelous.

06:51.113 --> 06:56.220
And we went, and I had one day off, and I worked my house off.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.042
So you went for it?

06:57.342 --> 06:57.983
Oh, we went.

06:58.003 --> 07:00.226
They brought us over for it, yeah.

07:00.647 --> 07:08.179
And actually, I'm fairly certain, if you call, they can tell you.

07:08.199 --> 07:14.388
I think I was high sales for that day.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.012
But I had one day off.

07:17.363 --> 07:25.376
I was only supposed to go to Barcelona, but things were so wild, I mean really wild, that they asked me to stay a week and go to Madrid.

07:25.396 --> 07:32.427
They brought us, including my son, to Madrid, and we did it for a week in Madrid.

07:35.551 --> 07:44.265
So I had one day left, and this guy who was president of one of the companies which owned my

07:44.785 --> 07:45.826
my publishing house.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.568
In other words, it was a big corporation.

07:47.588 --> 07:50.010
They called it Grupo Cepa.

07:50.530 --> 07:57.537
And he was a very nice guy, and we had dinner with his wife and his son.

07:58.038 --> 08:08.888
And he told me that he, back in the 13th century, that his family were Jews in Spain.

08:08.908 --> 08:13.392
This is a Christian family I'm talking about.

08:13.709 --> 08:17.595
driven out of the country where the Jews were expelled.

08:17.735 --> 08:21.661
They went to France for two centuries.

08:21.922 --> 08:28.432
He told us, for two centuries away, I'd say to you, yeah, we lived in West Massachusetts for four years, you know.

08:28.572 --> 08:38.788
And then in the 1700s, when the Inquisition eased, he said hundreds of thousands of people flooded back into Spain, but they all had names like

08:39.038 --> 08:49.252
De La Cruz, they had Catholic names that were now converted, you know, or some of them had been converted beforehand and had been Murano's conversos.

08:49.272 --> 08:52.977
They may have also been wise to us.

08:53.037 --> 08:58.124
Yeah, but at any rate, so he has not been Jewish for, you know, centuries.

08:58.645 --> 09:05.755
But he was kind of proud of the fact that his family had come from Toledo, and I'd heard

09:07.017 --> 09:16.005
I'm not totally a religious man, I'm not, but I'm very ethnic and my traditions go out to me.

09:16.085 --> 09:22.851
It represents my parents who were no longer here and my uncles and aunts and grandparents.

09:23.832 --> 09:35.843
And I've heard that there were two old synagogues in Toledo, and they haven't been synagogues since 1492, but I wanted to see them.

09:36.194 --> 09:37.556
Yeah.

09:37.756 --> 09:48.872
And so he arranged for a car and a driver and a guide and all this stuff.

09:48.892 --> 09:57.544
And we went out there and honestly the book that I'm now working on leads up and

09:57.811 --> 10:01.396
Don't quote me in PW, but bit me on the ass, you know.

10:01.416 --> 10:03.739
It really just was all there.

10:03.779 --> 10:10.889
All of a sudden, I saw this wonderful book that I wanted to write more than I wanted to write any of the books I've ever written, honestly.

10:11.790 --> 10:13.773
So it was kind of karma.

10:13.813 --> 10:21.523
And the whole thing, which is a modern story and an ancient story, and it all just was there for me in that one day.

10:21.925 --> 10:30.079
And so I said to Lorraine, you know, Lorraine, we talk about retirement, but she said, you know, so...

10:30.515 --> 10:32.738
I probably never was there.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.763
My first book was published at the age of 52.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.585
I'm as excited.

10:37.165 --> 10:38.207
Absolutely.

10:38.307 --> 10:40.250
And my mind is as sharp.

10:40.991 --> 10:42.434
Oh, you could write for years.

10:42.474 --> 10:44.657
And so could I. I can't wait to get out there.

10:44.777 --> 10:45.438
We're lucky.

10:45.458 --> 10:48.563
Do you really want to go out and do one of these trips?

10:48.724 --> 10:50.486
Do you not have any of my friends?

10:50.506 --> 10:51.588
I said, I can't wait.

10:51.708 --> 10:52.810
Do you not have any of my friends?

10:53.110 --> 11:01.101
hate their jobs, you know, have hated their jobs all their lives, welcome the chance to sit and leave the newspaper out there, which is probably crazy.

11:01.701 --> 11:02.242
But anyway.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.966
I quit my job five years ago.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.130
The best thing I ever did was to do this.

11:08.711 --> 11:09.732
Isn't that great?

11:09.752 --> 11:12.035
That your wife has to say it's okay.

11:12.957 --> 11:15.180
Then you know exactly, exactly.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.505
In this little speech I mentioned, you know, going to all that with Bob Murray.

11:19.525 --> 11:23.050
It's okay, but you have to be so certain that you have her emotional approval.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.674
Absolutely.

11:26.496 --> 11:27.959
Absolutely.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.304
There's no question about it.

11:30.945 --> 11:33.631
A writer who is married really needs a writer's wife.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.031
You bet.

11:34.532 --> 11:36.056
Because otherwise it's too tough.

11:36.076 --> 11:37.539
He gets pride in it.

11:37.559 --> 11:42.128
And I said, I'm going to get a new book to you.

11:42.188 --> 11:42.870
No question.

11:42.930 --> 11:43.992
No question about it.

11:44.461 --> 11:53.357
So I'm writing a book called The Secret Jew about the Inquisition and about a modern man

11:53.877 --> 11:55.639
That's the work in progress?

11:55.679 --> 11:57.501
That's the work in progress.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.123
And does it have a title?

11:59.384 --> 12:00.725
The Secret Union.

12:00.745 --> 12:01.446
That is a title.

12:01.566 --> 12:02.928
That's my working title at least.

12:02.948 --> 12:05.271
But you just told me, which is very interesting.

12:05.291 --> 12:05.952
That's the story.

12:06.152 --> 12:07.934
Well, that's right.

12:07.954 --> 12:10.117
Does it relate to any of these at all?

12:10.137 --> 12:22.332
No, it's a separate... So this series is basically... Funny, I get a lot of mail, a whole lot of mail, and they're mad at me for making it a trilogy.

12:22.750 --> 12:26.915
The characters, the same characters in the books, continued, you know.

12:27.555 --> 12:31.279
So, who knows, maybe when I'm 98, I'd want to go back and do one of them.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.942
Do you think you pretty much explored their history?

12:34.102 --> 12:37.446
Well, what I did, that's still going, isn't it?

12:37.466 --> 12:41.130
Yeah, what I did, Nick, was about 13 years ago.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.111
It's going all the time.

12:42.271 --> 12:43.452
Yeah, okay.

12:43.472 --> 12:51.441
About 13 years ago, I decided to do something that was very, that I didn't,

12:51.758 --> 13:03.075
really describe at the beginning because it's kind of pretentious and maybe a little pompous, but I decided to write in fiction a kind of simplified history of medicine.

13:04.517 --> 13:18.238
And the reason I chose three books instead of twelve books or eight books is that it seemed to me that medicine could be divided into three kind of main segments.

13:18.708 --> 13:36.900
One which took many centuries, from the earliest time all the way up to the middle of the 1800s, was a period when doctors led people and they cut patients and they gave them medications that often did them more harm than good and sometimes killed them.

13:38.883 --> 13:41.728
And that's what I wrote about in The Physician.

13:41.945 --> 13:44.789
and the first book of the series.

13:44.849 --> 13:46.110
Which I interviewed you in.

13:46.170 --> 13:46.411
Yeah.

13:46.671 --> 13:52.418
Was that the book that you had me to the telegram party for?

13:52.578 --> 13:53.179
I think so.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.741
I think so, yeah.

13:54.861 --> 13:56.763
That's right.

13:57.604 --> 14:01.129
What year was that published?

14:01.149 --> 14:02.210
You'll have to look.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.892
That'll be in the article.

14:03.912 --> 14:04.693
We'll have to look.

14:04.753 --> 14:06.716
You don't even know if it's there, but I can check it out.

14:06.876 --> 14:07.236
Okay.

14:08.338 --> 14:11.161
Because it'll help me find the clip in my story a lot easier.

14:11.282 --> 14:11.682
All right.

14:12.134 --> 14:15.958
Well, I think I've got all those dates upstairs, but I don't remember.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.763
And that was the first book.

14:20.424 --> 14:25.450
Actually, what I did was I wrote an outline to give credit where credit is due.

14:25.510 --> 14:35.081
I wrote an outline for that first book, and I shipped it to my agent, who was then a woman named Patricia Sharple at McIntosh and Otis.

14:35.301 --> 14:37.584
Very good agent.

14:37.604 --> 14:39.506
S-C-H-A-R-T-L-E.

14:39.626 --> 14:41.128
She's still around.

14:41.513 --> 14:43.295
Patricia Shadon, Myra.

14:43.756 --> 14:50.304
She married Tony Myra, Anton Myra, a novelist, one of her novelists she married and retired.

14:50.865 --> 14:53.588
He died about a week or two ago.

14:53.808 --> 14:54.930
I just saw you over it.

14:54.950 --> 14:57.813
He just died, yeah, which I'm sad about.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.936
I dropped a note.

14:59.956 --> 15:03.420
But she was my agent for some years, and she was a terrific agent.

15:03.441 --> 15:05.363
Bob Massey married his agent.

15:05.403 --> 15:05.743
Really?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.428
Must be comforting, in a way.

15:09.644 --> 15:11.087
But they love your work.

15:11.107 --> 15:12.430
I mean, it helps.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.893
Yeah, exactly.

15:14.795 --> 15:23.113
So anyway, Kat sent back a note, and she said she really loved the outline that was going to be ahead of the book.

15:23.583 --> 15:41.548
She said, Noah, did you ever think of maybe treating the author, the protagonist, as one of a series of generations of doctors, and that might make it a little more interesting.

15:41.568 --> 15:52.543
And I thought about it for a while, and I said, I don't want to do that, because if I do that, I'm going to have to skim over a lot of characters, and I won't be able to get any depth to the character.

15:52.945 --> 16:03.334
I'd rather do a series of books, and then I thought that I could do a history of medicine through this family of doctors, generation after generation of physicians.

16:03.575 --> 16:19.009
The second book would come right about just before, during, and after the Civil War, when medicine obtained two things.

16:19.089 --> 16:22.632
The American Civil War.

16:22.898 --> 16:33.654
They got anesthesia right here at the Massachusetts General Hospital, first operation done, I think it was 1864, and also antisepsis.

16:34.215 --> 16:36.919
So now, for the first time, they could operate on a patient.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.122
They wouldn't kill him because of shock.

16:39.142 --> 16:41.205
He wouldn't become infected, you know.

16:41.706 --> 16:44.089
And it's a whole new ballgame for medicine.

16:44.109 --> 16:46.513
And that was what I wrote about in Shaman, you know.

16:47.414 --> 16:48.636
And then the third book,

16:49.156 --> 16:51.539
takes place now.

16:51.619 --> 17:02.671
This book takes place now in a time of terrible turmoil as far as our health system in America is concerned.

17:02.691 --> 17:05.214
The system, it's not so much technique anymore.

17:05.414 --> 17:13.382
And as far as technique is concerned, what we have now is we have technology.

17:13.422 --> 17:18.488
We've got these wonder machines that give all kinds of

17:18.788 --> 17:45.758
sophisticated stuff which we never could do before but we paid something for them because now the doctor has a very limited contact with the patient he uses he's a machine keeper you know he is really troubled by all kinds of choices and decisions that he has to make about his professional life

17:46.227 --> 17:50.431
He's got to know how he feels about assisted death.

17:50.451 --> 17:52.753
He's got to know how he feels about abortion.

17:53.374 --> 18:02.122
Yeah, he's got to know how he feels about looking at people who don't have hospitalization insurance, medical insurance.

18:02.523 --> 18:03.163
And what do you do?

18:03.243 --> 18:04.044
You send them away.

18:04.064 --> 18:05.145
A lot of doctors do.

18:05.265 --> 18:06.246
A lot of doctors don't.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.270
I know doctors who treat patients pretty, you know.

18:10.851 --> 18:13.213
But I know doctors who do not do that too.

18:13.919 --> 18:18.023
Did you get into this whole question of transplants?

18:18.143 --> 18:20.385
No, I didn't get into transplants.

18:20.405 --> 18:24.528
What I got into was my protagonist in this one is a woman.

18:25.389 --> 18:33.316
And the reason for that is that in the other two books, the protagonist couldn't have been a woman because there weren't women doctors.

18:34.537 --> 18:36.539
And now we have women doctors all over the world.

18:37.440 --> 18:43.065
So I thought that that would really be interesting.

18:43.467 --> 18:49.272
And she starts out in Boston at a medical center with all the machines.

18:50.313 --> 18:58.800
And she ends up at a little town that my fellow townsmen are going to recognize immediately up in the hills of West of Massachusetts.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.442
You know, Main Street is Main Street.

19:02.163 --> 19:03.404
Her house is different.

19:03.424 --> 19:04.405
You wouldn't name it in the book.

19:04.845 --> 19:12.732
I forgot, Woodfield, I think.

19:13.218 --> 19:17.204
but it's Asheville, Massachusetts.

19:17.244 --> 19:26.857
The land that the house is on is absolutely mine to the last inch, including the trail we cut through the woods and the river and all that.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.860
This is for fun then?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.242
Yeah, I had a good time.

19:30.402 --> 19:34.348
As a matter of fact, a woman from

19:34.683 --> 19:48.179
from Munich came and stayed with us for three days and saw the town and saw the, you know, the trail, walked the trail and all that stuff.

19:48.199 --> 19:51.823
And if you ever wanted to go out there for the day, we'd have a good time hiking around.

19:52.805 --> 20:01.575
But anyway, so that's the story of that trilogy.

20:01.715 --> 20:03.998
And this book, the new book,

20:04.585 --> 20:06.809
Let me just interrupt a second.

20:06.929 --> 20:10.876
Did you originally envision, you said a series, was it three in your mind?

20:10.976 --> 20:14.923
It was three because of the three divisions.

20:14.943 --> 20:16.205
So it always was three?

20:16.226 --> 20:17.688
It was always three, no more.

20:17.969 --> 20:22.056
Did you see them as a trilogy in a specific sense or a series of three?

20:22.316 --> 20:25.041
Well, I saw them as a trilogy because

20:25.055 --> 20:29.162
Although they stand alone, they're vastly different stories.

20:29.322 --> 20:31.025
Are they all related in fact?

20:31.225 --> 20:34.050
Well, they're related in the same family.

20:34.230 --> 20:38.657
And a couple of things, genetic things, genetic things.

20:38.677 --> 20:49.695
I took a chance on something in the first book, which is I showed a man who simply by holding someone's hands could sense

20:50.198 --> 20:51.781
impending death.

20:52.663 --> 20:55.469
Now that's kind of weird and science fiction-y.

20:55.809 --> 20:59.056
And I said to myself, God, I covered medicine all those years.

20:59.076 --> 21:04.246
Now all the doctors in the world are going to jump on me and say, what's it?

21:04.287 --> 21:06.992
They call me up and they say,

21:07.225 --> 21:08.748
You don't know me.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.051
I practice such and such in Tennessee.

21:11.752 --> 21:14.757
Is there anything I can do to help y'all out?

21:14.777 --> 21:15.398
They drop in.

21:15.459 --> 21:17.542
They drop in at the house.

21:17.562 --> 21:18.864
They come for lunch.

21:18.884 --> 21:19.685
Because you got it.

21:19.706 --> 21:20.507
Because you nailed it.

21:20.527 --> 21:27.899
Because the three, the two books, you know, although I've talked to European doctors about the other, this and this one.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.944
But they really love them.

21:30.964 --> 21:31.765
They really do.

21:32.527 --> 21:34.009
You'll see on the credits of this,

21:34.445 --> 21:40.394
a couple of professors across the medical school, general practitioner in the hills, Greenfield doctors.

21:40.415 --> 21:42.698
Can they respond to this thing about the field?

21:42.718 --> 21:43.319
Oh, yeah.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.943
Well, they say, I have gotten letters.

21:46.064 --> 21:55.098
This is the weird thing, not from doctors, but I've gotten letters from people who say, my cousin has this ability, you know, and discuss it very seriously.

21:55.118 --> 22:01.448
And then I talk to doctors, and they say that...

22:01.647 --> 22:26.389
they know a lot of doctors who without clinical science you know without any scientific know when a patient's not going to make it because you know it's just something they learn how to yeah i do too so that's that's as stretchy as i got and uh i'll tell you i am the world's luckiest man as far as my career is concerned i i know that

22:26.977 --> 22:29.922
But I've also worked my ass off.

22:29.942 --> 22:32.706
I have worked so hard.

22:33.427 --> 22:34.408
I really have.

22:34.929 --> 22:39.036
And I've had other writers say to me, what's the matter with you?

22:39.056 --> 22:41.640
You know, you can knock out a book a year, right?

22:41.840 --> 22:45.385
And it takes me about four years because I researched the daylights out.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.589
We've got to get into that.

22:47.609 --> 22:49.872
And I'm going to use the pursuer.

22:49.892 --> 22:50.553
Go ahead.

22:50.934 --> 22:54.840
You were saying out on the street that you started it for 40.

22:55.360 --> 22:59.244
writing books, but you always had these twin goals of being... Oh, yeah.

22:59.264 --> 23:01.326
When I was a kid... Sorry.

23:01.667 --> 23:10.637
When I was a kid, when I was a little child in Worcester... Are you a Worcester native?

23:10.777 --> 23:11.678
I'm a Worcester native.

23:11.698 --> 23:13.179
I was born in Worcester.

23:13.199 --> 23:13.700
I didn't know that.

23:14.521 --> 23:24.051
And I lived on Houghton Street on Grafton Hill, and we had a...

23:25.246 --> 23:27.249
a neighborhood party.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.535
I must have been six years old or something like that.

23:32.356 --> 23:33.418
And we had a maypole.

23:34.339 --> 23:44.554
In this working class neighborhood, you know, we had a field behind the house and somebody had the imagination of creating a maypole and all the little kids danced around a maypole.

23:45.335 --> 23:48.119
And I was the king.

23:48.179 --> 23:51.844
I ended up as the king, a little kid, and there was a little girl who was the queen.

23:52.398 --> 24:01.487
And they called the telegram, somebody with publicity mind, and they called the telegram, and a reporter and a photographer came out.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.249
I remember this so clearly.

24:04.009 --> 24:13.659
I thought that was the most wonderful thing, that all that these guys did was go to, you know, great places and talk to people.

24:13.959 --> 24:17.503
And I immediately thought that that was... Okay, don't mind me, by the way.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.364
Yeah, okay, good.

24:18.944 --> 24:21.747
And that's better because I can't pose for a picture.

24:22.081 --> 24:49.270
So, I thought that that was wonderful, and I began thinking about journalism, and as I grew up, you know, reading newspapers and about newspapers, excuse me, but we didn't have any money, like most of the people in my half of Worcester, and it was

24:49.570 --> 24:52.573
I was a Depression kid, the end of the Depression, I remember it.

24:54.075 --> 24:57.378
And so we never went away on vacation or anything like that.

24:58.219 --> 25:09.291
And I discovered early that by reading books, you know, I could go anywhere.

25:09.331 --> 25:17.940
And so I started going to Billings Square Library.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.104
Sometimes I'd go twice a day.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.285
You know, I'd get four books.

25:22.066 --> 25:30.976
I'd run home and I'd race through the books and I'd come back and I would read them and come in again for four more books.

25:31.836 --> 25:37.182
And the librarians used to say to me, Noah, go swimming this afternoon.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.123
Truly, truly.

25:38.884 --> 25:47.353
And, but, so I had, right from the time I was a little kid, I had two

25:47.755 --> 25:52.222
I thought I would like to be a newspaper reporter and I would like to write books.

25:53.243 --> 26:03.900
And I'm one of the few people, I think, who has been really able to do what he dreamed of as a kid, didn't become an anthropologist or a plumber instead, you know.

26:04.521 --> 26:08.186
So tell me about, so you went to Worcester schools?

26:08.266 --> 26:11.652
I went to Eastside Worcester schools.

26:11.712 --> 26:15.197
I went to Union Hill School for grammar school.

26:15.515 --> 26:17.778
I went to Grafton Street Junior High School.

26:17.798 --> 26:17.918
Geez.

26:19.040 --> 26:19.821
Yeah.

26:20.181 --> 26:33.899
And then I went to Classical High, where we got a kind of great education few kids are able to get from American public schools today, which is terrible.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.281
Tragedy.

26:35.301 --> 26:36.783
So is Moraine a Worcester woman?

26:36.803 --> 26:40.247
Moraine went to Classical High School, too.

26:40.888 --> 26:45.454
I didn't know her until I had been discharged from the Army.

26:45.788 --> 26:53.936
And was about to start college, and we double dated, you know, and I met her.

26:54.316 --> 26:56.018
And you were in service for her?

26:56.038 --> 27:04.586
I was in service from, oh God, I used to remember those dates, February 6th or something, 1945.

27:04.866 --> 27:06.528
Right after the war.

27:06.648 --> 27:10.992
To 20 months later, yeah.

27:11.012 --> 27:12.173
Yeah, the end of the war.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.036
Actually, I went in when...

27:16.079 --> 27:24.251
As I say in that speech, Harry Truman's been, you know, castigated for dropping the bomb.

27:24.271 --> 27:24.772
No, by me.

27:24.792 --> 27:27.597
My father was ready to ship out of the tanker.

27:27.837 --> 27:33.245
So was I. I mean, we had been... I had been through Repl-Depot No.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.787
2, Replacement Depot No.

27:34.807 --> 27:41.698
2 for the Pacific War, which was still going on, and they pulled us off.

27:41.918 --> 27:45.023
They brought us to...

27:45.273 --> 27:59.466
Presidio of Monterey to form the 7th Corps, and one of my friends who was a corporal, his name was just the same as a famous correspondent, Connie.

28:01.788 --> 28:05.492
Anyway, his father was a newspaper man, divorced from his mother.

28:06.052 --> 28:14.520
His father was overseas covering the war, but his mother worked for the Department of War, now Department of Defense, and she used to send

28:14.872 --> 28:19.218
cards to his next posting to let him know where he was going.

28:19.298 --> 28:26.209
And we were going to join Signal Corps, what they called JASCOs, which were joint assault signal companies.

28:26.629 --> 28:27.490
I was in the infantry.

28:27.991 --> 28:35.522
So we would give cover to the first wave that set up the communication systems for the invasion of Japan.

28:36.163 --> 28:37.325
Probably would have been killed.

28:37.565 --> 28:39.348
I thought it was going to be a sailor.

28:39.368 --> 28:40.369
It was going to be an oiler.

28:40.650 --> 28:40.930
Yeah.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.828
Yeah, yeah.

28:44.391 --> 28:49.452
So, you know, Lorraine and I have marched, actually, up in Asheville to come

28:49.583 --> 28:52.406
to commemorate the people who were killed there, you know, to pay respect.

28:52.446 --> 28:57.051
You ask people like Bill Manchester or Paul Faso, you know, how they feel about it.

28:57.151 --> 28:57.491
Yeah.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.733
You know, they absolutely feel lives were saved.

28:59.753 --> 29:00.114
Yeah.

29:00.574 --> 29:00.955
Oh, yeah.

29:01.135 --> 29:05.719
A lot of lives were saved by those bombs, which was a terrible thing, but... Terrible thing?

29:05.739 --> 29:06.680
War is a terrible thing.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.442
Yeah, war is a terrible thing.

29:08.482 --> 29:09.283
We know that.

29:09.303 --> 29:10.224
Yeah, absolutely.

29:10.244 --> 29:13.167
And I really think that we're taking a rotten rap on that.

29:14.168 --> 29:19.033
Well, anyway, it was funny to me because we were marching in...

29:19.334 --> 29:25.340
in Asheville, not to demonstrate or anything, it was just to show respect to the people who had been killed there.

29:25.701 --> 29:32.969
And this guy was yelling, calling us pinkos and everything, and here I was happy that they dropped the bomb, and he just couldn't see the connection.

29:33.329 --> 29:42.919
But anyway, so... So it's, and I don't need all the minute stuff, but... So then you went to Boston University, you said the J School?

29:43.360 --> 29:44.481
I went to J School.

29:44.815 --> 29:47.057
And did you go work for the T&G?

29:47.077 --> 29:47.397
No.

29:47.718 --> 29:54.084
I went to J School, and I...two things.

29:54.244 --> 29:55.605
We weren't ready to be married.

29:55.625 --> 29:56.867
She had another year of school.

29:57.167 --> 29:57.867
And she went to Clark.

29:57.888 --> 29:58.628
She went to Clark.

29:59.389 --> 30:03.953
And the immediate past president of the Friends of the Goddard Library in Clark.

30:03.973 --> 30:04.194
Oh, great.

30:04.394 --> 30:05.375
That's a great library.

30:05.695 --> 30:06.876
Good library, really.

30:07.477 --> 30:12.021
But...and I felt...I wanted a...I wanted a...

30:12.524 --> 30:19.150
more liberal education, although at the J School we had 75% of our courses were liberal arts, and I enjoyed it there.

30:19.690 --> 30:39.807
But I was working under two people, a guy named Gerald Warner Brace, who was a good novelist, and he was at the School of Liberal Arts in the Graduate School, and Dorothy Spear, who was a very commercial novelist, former MGM contract writer, and she wrote a bestseller called The Road to Needles, I think, years and years ago.

30:40.348 --> 30:41.569
And her father was

30:42.038 --> 30:44.462
Treasurer, E. Ray Speer, Treasurer of the University.

30:44.482 --> 30:45.504
She came there to die.

30:45.584 --> 30:47.667
She came from California.

30:47.687 --> 30:48.629
She had a cancer.

30:48.649 --> 30:49.591
She knew she was dying.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.594
She died a year after I left the school.

30:53.036 --> 30:54.479
But for a couple of years she taught.

30:54.599 --> 30:56.402
She was a really good teacher of writing.

30:57.284 --> 31:02.352
And I felt, you know, it was a chance to stay on.

31:02.653 --> 31:08.282
And I got half a year left on the GI Bill and I borrowed 300 bucks from an uncle.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.146
You can't do that today and stay in school.

31:11.667 --> 31:15.135
But I did then, and that was the first thing we repaid after I got married.

31:15.155 --> 31:17.721
Yeah, but $300 then is like three grand today.

31:17.781 --> 31:18.843
Yeah, that was a lot of money then.

31:18.883 --> 31:19.304
That it is.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.208
Yeah, and he was nice enough.

31:21.248 --> 31:24.054
My tuition at Bates, 34 years, and always $2,000.

31:24.074 --> 31:25.878
He said, well, that's nothing.

31:25.898 --> 31:27.462
I said, no, it was a lot.

31:27.502 --> 31:28.063
Absolutely.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.005
My father really had his...

31:29.390 --> 31:30.771
Oh, yeah.

31:30.892 --> 31:37.018
I'm sure my uncle never expected to see the money back, but Lorraine v. Lorraine, you know, we were happy.

31:37.358 --> 31:39.540
As soon as we were married, that was the first thing we paid off.

31:39.981 --> 31:46.307
But there wasn't a job at the Telegram.

31:47.148 --> 31:49.450
I tried to get a job teaching English.

31:49.510 --> 31:52.333
I had a new master's in English and creative writing, you know.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.214
And you got back from where?

31:53.594 --> 31:57.118
From BU, from the graduate school.

31:58.448 --> 32:00.731
And there was a recession at the time.

32:00.771 --> 32:02.793
There were no jobs in the whole area.

32:02.913 --> 32:04.155
We're in the 50s now.

32:04.175 --> 32:05.516
We're in 1951.

32:06.978 --> 32:10.082
And so I went to New York.

32:10.122 --> 32:14.146
I had another uncle with an apartment on Washington Heights or something.

32:14.487 --> 32:15.288
And I stayed there.

32:15.308 --> 32:18.852
I went to CCNY and ran off a bunch of resumes.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.475
And I just went from publishing house to publishing house.

32:22.516 --> 32:23.337
Here's a resume.

32:23.357 --> 32:24.238
I'm looking for work.

32:24.338 --> 32:28.303
And it took me three of the most agonizing

32:28.672 --> 32:31.395
rejection-laden weeks of my life.

32:32.316 --> 32:35.700
And I got a job at Avon as a junior editor.

32:36.481 --> 32:38.444
And we published a lot of junk.

32:39.385 --> 32:40.606
I was in the periodic department.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.428
Were the paperbacks in there?

32:42.529 --> 32:44.711
No, that was a big paperback house.

32:46.093 --> 32:47.955
But I was in the periodical department.

32:48.335 --> 32:56.005
We published a science fiction reader, a fantasy reader, gardening manuals, and about 19 comic books.

32:57.326 --> 32:57.987
It was a job.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.806
It was a great starting job.

33:00.826 --> 33:01.447
I'll tell you why.

33:01.607 --> 33:04.612
I was earning nothing, you know, I mean really nothing.

33:05.613 --> 33:11.302
And I was there for a while.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.346
We were living, literally living in a garret.

33:15.688 --> 33:22.138
My uncle, another uncle in Brooklyn had gotten us an attic apartment around the corner from where he lived in Borough Park.

33:23.340 --> 33:23.620
And

33:24.140 --> 33:28.005
And no furniture, you know, I mean, it was very romantic.

33:28.025 --> 33:30.488
We thought we were like poets in Paris, you know.

33:31.109 --> 33:34.073
But it began parling after a while.

33:34.353 --> 33:37.177
And I knew I needed more money.

33:37.197 --> 33:40.461
And I went to my boss and I said, you know, I just can't make it.

33:40.561 --> 33:44.426
I think my take home was $43 or something.

33:45.928 --> 33:47.490
And he didn't want to lose me.

33:48.151 --> 33:52.196
So what he did was, do you remember comic books?

33:52.216 --> 33:53.237
Oh, yeah.

33:53.257 --> 33:53.758
They had...

33:53.873 --> 34:00.199
They had the pages of solid matter in the middle of it, a little short story, kind of.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.621
And we used to buy them from freelancers.

34:03.061 --> 34:04.623
Instead, he assigned them to me.

34:04.643 --> 34:08.606
So I'd go home for the weekend, and I don't know, he paid me.

34:08.686 --> 34:12.350
Yeah, he paid me like, I don't know, I don't remember whether it was $25 or $75.

34:12.670 --> 34:15.673
And I used to knock a few of them off.

34:16.193 --> 34:17.274
When did we get paid for that?

34:17.594 --> 34:17.935
For what?

34:17.955 --> 34:21.177
For the little comic book things I did for Southern.

34:21.197 --> 34:21.838
$11 a page.

34:22.207 --> 34:23.789
Eleven's on the page?

34:23.950 --> 34:24.891
Is that okay?

34:25.131 --> 34:26.914
No, eleven dollars a year.

34:26.934 --> 34:27.495
Oh, it's red.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.197
Is that all I got?

34:29.478 --> 34:30.459
No, that was wonderful.

34:30.479 --> 34:32.101
You had a seven dollar a week long.

34:32.442 --> 34:33.463
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.483 --> 34:38.991
Well, anyway, I used to knock them off, you know, maybe a number of them on the weekend.

34:39.011 --> 34:41.515
When I went to Bates, I worked for the Lewiston Sun at night.

34:41.647 --> 34:42.829
for a buck and a half an hour.

34:43.189 --> 34:45.914
You've got to remember, this was in 1951.

34:46.094 --> 34:47.937
For 12 bucks, I take home 10 bucks.

34:47.957 --> 34:48.778
It was great money.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.321
It was a wonderful experience for you.

34:50.341 --> 34:53.686
You could say it worked on a newspaper.

34:53.726 --> 34:59.435
Anyway, it was great because all they are is sheer plot, those little things.

34:59.936 --> 35:03.261
I was learning about storylines and what worked.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.326
You were writing for readership.

35:06.886 --> 35:09.190
I was writing for readership and I was also writing

35:09.592 --> 35:11.174
And they had a romance book.

35:11.254 --> 35:15.960
I was writing an advice to the Love Lawn column, and I would put in the names of all of my friends.

35:16.001 --> 35:20.687
I would fake this book, fake the letters, and sign my friends' names.

35:20.707 --> 35:21.127
Oh, come on.

35:21.147 --> 35:21.788
I did, really.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.353
We had the most fun with it, you know, close friends, and nothing liable.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.214
The Wonderfly Magazine was there.

35:26.254 --> 35:26.815
Nothing liable.

35:26.935 --> 35:28.057
I don't remember the name.

35:28.077 --> 35:29.659
It was a romance comic book.

35:30.019 --> 35:30.760
It was a comic book.

35:30.780 --> 35:31.721
Comic book, yeah.

35:32.382 --> 35:38.991
And anyway, I did that for a period of time, and

35:39.241 --> 35:41.744
So you're just married now, because I think you said 51.

35:43.226 --> 35:43.907
You were married.

35:44.028 --> 35:44.388
Yeah.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.711
Did Lorraine live in New York with you?

35:46.731 --> 35:47.212
Oh, yeah.

35:47.693 --> 35:48.734
Yeah, she lived in New York.

35:48.754 --> 35:57.546
We lived in a little attic hovel, and I think I got laid off from there.

35:58.668 --> 36:07.560
Not because of my work, which was, my boss really liked me, but I was assistant to the editor of the department, and they

36:08.013 --> 36:12.097
They took away his assistant because of, you know, cutbacks.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.119
It was a bad recession.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.380
I had worked there about two years.

36:16.341 --> 36:23.807
And I'm trying to remember how I got the other job.

36:24.868 --> 36:35.758
I think maybe, I don't remember if I answered an ad in the paper or what, but I remember

36:36.903 --> 36:41.688
running into a classmate looking for work.

36:41.768 --> 36:44.271
Classmate of mine is Jason in New York.

36:45.312 --> 36:57.265
And he's saying to me, Ed Lin, and Ed said to me, no, it's not only as if they're advertising for a bus driver when they're asking for a writer or an editor.

36:57.565 --> 37:04.072
They want a bus driver who intimately knows the corner of Main Street and Elm.

37:05.073 --> 37:05.914
You know what I mean?

37:06.046 --> 37:08.991
So it was discouraging for young guys starting out.

37:09.011 --> 37:16.302
But I got a job on a little news and picture magazine.

37:17.003 --> 37:19.047
Look published a thing called Quick.

37:19.588 --> 37:20.188
I remember Quick.

37:20.349 --> 37:22.632
Well, we were the first imitator of Quick.

37:22.753 --> 37:23.734
It was called Focus.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.557
And I worked there for a couple of years.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.460
I started... A couple of years.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.121
A couple of years.

37:28.141 --> 37:29.884
You did your apprenticeship, didn't you?

37:30.165 --> 37:34.271
Yes, and that was good because I did all kinds of stories, all kinds of stories.

37:34.351 --> 37:38.458
I road tested a jet plane, you know, an army plane.

37:39.119 --> 37:50.517
I did all kinds of stories, interviewed all kinds of people, and I ended up as managing editor of that book.

37:50.537 --> 37:51.058
This is Focus.

37:51.078 --> 37:53.502
Focus, but we never really liked New York.

37:53.701 --> 37:54.923
Do you remember a little published focus?

37:54.943 --> 37:56.405
Yes, magazine management.

37:57.246 --> 37:59.089
And we never really liked New York.

37:59.229 --> 38:00.712
We hated New York.

38:00.812 --> 38:04.057
We were, you know, products of smaller places.

38:04.297 --> 38:11.428
And I used to come home to Brooklyn, and we had our first child, and I'd see my wife.

38:11.448 --> 38:11.808
You went to where?

38:12.289 --> 38:12.970
To Brooklyn.

38:13.030 --> 38:13.811
So you lived in Brooklyn?

38:13.831 --> 38:14.532
I lived in Brooklyn.

38:14.552 --> 38:18.258
I used to work on Madison Avenue, you know, long commute by train.

38:18.899 --> 38:21.683
Really no money, and I would come home.

38:21.967 --> 38:26.431
and find my wife and kids seated by the garbage cans waiting for daddy, you know?

38:26.451 --> 38:28.853
So the kid, you already started having a family right away.

38:29.013 --> 38:34.418
Lisa, not right away, but Lorraine had a miss with our first one.

38:34.538 --> 38:35.919
Maybe, I don't know.

38:35.939 --> 38:38.621
Before I forget, why don't you give me the kids and the names?

38:38.841 --> 38:40.923
Lisa was my oldest child.

38:41.083 --> 38:41.684
Lisa Ann.

38:41.904 --> 38:42.785
L-I-S-E.

38:44.846 --> 38:45.127
No, Lisa.

38:45.147 --> 38:46.608
No, she doesn't use the Ann anymore.

38:47.429 --> 38:48.670
L-I-S-E, Gordon.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.431
Lisa Gordon.

38:50.832 --> 38:51.332
She lives where?

38:51.464 --> 38:52.665
She lives in Watertown.

38:53.286 --> 38:53.586
Okay.

38:54.387 --> 38:58.652
She has given us our first grandchild, but I'm going to ask you not to mention them.

38:59.654 --> 38:59.754
Okay.

38:59.774 --> 39:00.394
If you don't mind.

39:00.615 --> 39:02.036
I mean, I'm weird about that.

39:02.117 --> 39:05.240
I don't want anyone messing with that kid because of publicity.

39:05.901 --> 39:06.181
That's fine.

39:06.382 --> 39:06.622
You know?

39:06.642 --> 39:07.523
They're crazy people.

39:07.543 --> 39:08.724
I wouldn't even say where they live.

39:08.844 --> 39:09.045
Yeah.

39:09.465 --> 39:12.168
Okay, well, Lisa lives in the... They're all in the Boston area.

39:12.188 --> 39:12.288
Yeah.

39:12.929 --> 39:14.831
And Jamie is our middle child.

39:15.092 --> 39:15.192
Yeah.

39:15.212 --> 39:20.458
I mean, I'll just mention... And Michael is our youngest.

39:20.675 --> 39:24.539
And he lives in Brookline, too.

39:24.559 --> 39:25.060
Brookline.

39:25.921 --> 39:26.401
Brookline.

39:26.421 --> 39:27.302
That sounded like Brooklyn.

39:27.482 --> 39:30.706
No, he lives in Brookline, but I used to come home to Brooklyn.

39:32.247 --> 39:34.670
I'm not even going to say you live in Brookline.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.993
I'm going to say you have an apartment in suburban Boston.

39:38.013 --> 39:38.714
That's wonderful.

39:39.315 --> 39:40.176
That's wonderful.

39:40.276 --> 39:42.698
And a house in western Massachusetts.

39:42.718 --> 39:43.199
Oh, yeah.

39:43.399 --> 39:45.181
I never do that stuff.

39:45.201 --> 39:45.641
Wonderful.

39:45.822 --> 39:48.184
Okay, because it scares me.

39:49.295 --> 39:50.236
Don't worry about it.

39:50.256 --> 39:50.356
Okay.

39:50.477 --> 39:51.358
Thanks, Nick.

39:51.378 --> 40:01.070
And anyway, so I came here and I freelanced for a year doing men's magazine stuff and things like that.

40:01.491 --> 40:02.532
Here being Boston?

40:02.592 --> 40:03.133
In Worcester.

40:03.153 --> 40:03.634
In Worcester.

40:03.654 --> 40:07.138
First I lived with my mother-in-law and then we got an apartment on June Street.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.201
This is a Worcester story.

40:09.221 --> 40:10.703
This is a Worcester story, yeah.

40:11.384 --> 40:14.408
And it was, you know,

40:14.624 --> 40:23.854
I'd come home and there'd be three checks in the thing, and we would say, wow, we're rich, and then five months would go by and you wouldn't get a check, you know.

40:24.435 --> 40:31.283
So, finally I went up, and I'm trying to remember the name of the guy who interviewed me first for the Telegram.

40:31.323 --> 40:36.809
He retired almost immediately.

40:37.369 --> 40:38.010
You wouldn't know him.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.832
He was long ago.

40:40.172 --> 40:44.277
But anyway, then I saw Frank Murphy.

40:44.847 --> 40:46.169
And they hired me.

40:46.209 --> 40:47.851
They put me out into Fitchburg.

40:49.173 --> 40:50.676
And I had a good time.

40:50.716 --> 40:51.457
Well, what year was this?

40:53.660 --> 40:56.464
Well, let's say I got my master's in 51.

40:56.644 --> 41:01.792
I think I was in New York about four years and then a year of freelancing.

41:01.832 --> 41:04.216
Must have been about 56, maybe.

41:04.236 --> 41:07.260
56 to 60 years of telegram.

41:07.477 --> 41:08.699
I don't know.

41:08.739 --> 41:10.943
I'll have to get the dates and dig them out.

41:11.463 --> 41:14.609
I've got them all written down, but I'll give them to you.

41:14.969 --> 41:15.690
I'll call you with them.

41:16.612 --> 41:19.817
I'm sorry to be a stickler.

41:19.877 --> 41:20.698
No, no, no.

41:20.759 --> 41:21.239
That's good.

41:21.700 --> 41:29.653
But I worked in the county for... They had a crazy rule then.

41:30.393 --> 41:34.439
To work in the city, you have to have a master's degree, which I had for me.

41:34.459 --> 41:35.861
What, that was a rule they had?

41:35.961 --> 41:36.502
That was a rule.

41:36.542 --> 41:41.829
To come into, now what, Jack Tubert never graduated, never went to school, you know.

41:42.290 --> 41:48.699
But for new reporters, at the time, they made you take a battery of psychological tests.

41:48.719 --> 41:50.741
The guy came out and was hiring me.

41:51.202 --> 41:59.033
It wasn't Frank Murphy, and he said, God, this shows that you're a cross between, you know, a poet and a businessman.

42:00.008 --> 42:00.689
I looked at him.

42:01.250 --> 42:06.138
And they put me out in Fitchburg, where I worked under Dave Gilmogno.

42:06.178 --> 42:07.520
Worked me hard, and that was good.

42:08.201 --> 42:09.703
And I covered, you know.

42:09.723 --> 42:10.465
Oh, I knew Dave.

42:11.106 --> 42:11.386
Yeah.

42:11.466 --> 42:12.688
He stayed till the bitter end.

42:12.708 --> 42:13.870
Yeah, he stayed a long time.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.993
And his kid became mayor of Fitchburg.

42:16.094 --> 42:17.456
I wondered if that was his kid.

42:17.496 --> 42:18.177
I saw Gilmogno.

42:18.197 --> 42:20.741
He was a firefighter, and then he became... Yeah, yeah.

42:21.122 --> 42:21.362
Wow.

42:21.763 --> 42:23.265
And his brother, I think, is...

42:23.768 --> 42:24.610
Is that Ed Martin?

42:24.951 --> 42:25.713
Yes, I don't know.

42:26.074 --> 42:29.503
Gil Martin got a great sweetheart job at the UMass Medical School.

42:29.623 --> 42:30.125
Gil Martin?

42:30.365 --> 42:30.967
Dave did.

42:30.987 --> 42:31.629
Dave did?

42:31.649 --> 42:37.865
Dave, yeah, when he left the paper, I mean, because all of his connections, he was like the head of PR for the UMass.

42:37.885 --> 42:39.449
And he didn't know a thing about medicine.

42:39.469 --> 42:40.191
He was straight.

42:40.627 --> 42:43.991
He paid more money than he's made in his life, probably.

42:44.011 --> 42:44.912
Isn't that great?

42:45.092 --> 42:45.593
I'm glad.

42:45.633 --> 42:48.176
I don't even know if he's alive or dead now, to tell you.

42:48.716 --> 42:52.320
But anyway, he worked us all hard, didn't do a thing out there himself.

42:52.340 --> 42:54.483
I want to start moving this along, because I've been in Herald, right?

42:54.503 --> 42:55.444
Okay, yeah.

42:55.784 --> 43:01.831
So you were to telegram for about four years, or whatever, and then you went from there to the Herald?

43:01.891 --> 43:06.837
The Herald, yeah, hired me away.

43:07.306 --> 43:26.165
Actually, the telegram would have been very chagrined, but their business writer, what was his name, very well-known business writer, he recommended me to a friend on the Herald, and I didn't even know him, but I got a call from the Herald, and I came in, and they hired me, and I worked.

43:27.846 --> 43:30.289
First, I got a good job.

43:30.869 --> 43:35.794
They somehow knew I could write, and I got the color.

43:36.162 --> 43:38.004
on the top story of the day.

43:38.064 --> 43:39.906
I was always on page one with the sidebar.

43:40.527 --> 43:44.071
Somebody else would do the, you know, the hard news.

43:44.111 --> 43:45.994
The hard news, you did the soft news stories.

43:46.114 --> 43:48.937
And I did the soft news stories, which was fun.

43:49.017 --> 43:50.799
Which is what the Herald of the Graduate is.

43:51.019 --> 43:51.400
Yeah, yeah.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.202
So, well, this wasn't this Herald.

43:53.222 --> 43:53.943
This was the Herald.

43:54.003 --> 43:56.706
This was the old, full folio Herald.

43:56.766 --> 43:57.968
Herald Traveller, yeah.

43:58.008 --> 43:58.548
Yeah.

43:58.568 --> 43:59.950
Before it was the Herald Traveller.

43:59.970 --> 44:00.911
Even before the Traveller?

44:00.931 --> 44:01.031
Yeah.

44:01.131 --> 44:04.796
The Traveller was the morning paper, like the telegram and the gazette, you know.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.017
So, uh,

44:06.352 --> 44:07.333
I worked there.

44:07.454 --> 44:08.735
I wanted to cover science.

44:08.976 --> 44:09.556
I really did.

44:09.596 --> 44:11.639
I wanted to cover science when I was at the Telegram.

44:12.460 --> 44:15.124
It's all in this speech.

44:15.284 --> 44:17.387
I went to Hudson-Hogland with the Pallista Foundation.

44:17.427 --> 44:19.290
He gave me a list of books to read.

44:19.790 --> 44:20.612
I read them.

44:20.632 --> 44:25.338
Just to know while you're at the... While I'm at the Herald, while I'm at the Telegram, too, really.

44:25.899 --> 44:30.165
And I began digging up science stories for myself.

44:30.465 --> 44:34.791
So how did the first book become to be written?

44:34.991 --> 44:36.173
I...

44:36.389 --> 44:40.975
I went to cover a medical meeting at Dartmouth.

44:41.556 --> 44:46.282
I ran into Evan Hill, an old friend who used to teach at BU when I was there, you know.

44:46.823 --> 44:51.749
And he was working for the Saturday Evening Post, and he said, what are you writing?

44:51.769 --> 44:55.394
And I said, a Sunday column, and he said, you're a lazy bastard.

44:55.414 --> 45:05.788
And I went back, and he got me mad, and I sat down and I batted out an idea and sent it to the Saturday Evening Post to Ben Hidd, the editor, yeah, but didn't say that

45:05.937 --> 45:10.581
I didn't presume on our friendship because I didn't want to embarrass them.

45:10.902 --> 45:11.622
But they bought it.

45:12.143 --> 45:22.933
And then he came out a little while later and we had lunch and he said, you know, the piece he sold to the Post, for two years I had been building a file on that piece.

45:22.973 --> 45:24.995
I was going to do it myself for the Post.

45:25.015 --> 45:25.956
And what was the piece?

45:25.976 --> 45:30.180
It was a piece on a priest in Boston who did two things.

45:30.220 --> 45:34.965
He worked with suicides, talking them off of ledges, and he worked with street gangs.

45:34.996 --> 45:37.179
And they used it as a cover story on the place.

45:37.239 --> 45:38.141
50s now, right?

45:38.201 --> 45:40.144
Because they were in the 60s now.

45:40.424 --> 45:42.147
This is in the 60s, I guess.

45:42.487 --> 45:43.669
Yeah, early 60s.

45:44.410 --> 45:48.677
And the post ran it as a cover story.

45:49.678 --> 45:51.121
And then went out of business.

45:51.181 --> 45:52.022
Do you remember the headline?

45:52.062 --> 45:52.963
Then went out of business.

45:53.484 --> 45:56.609
I think it was called Suicide Priesthood.

45:56.649 --> 45:57.150
Maybe not.

45:57.230 --> 45:57.831
Street Gang.

45:57.931 --> 45:58.512
I don't remember.

45:58.532 --> 45:59.774
I really don't remember.

46:00.355 --> 46:00.615
But...

46:03.008 --> 46:19.149
I remember that they sent a couple of high-powered photographers, two brothers, didn't consult me, didn't call me, thank God, and they got the priest and they made a date with the street gang.

46:19.169 --> 46:20.992
The street gang didn't show up.

46:21.012 --> 46:30.484
They just grabbed kids off the street, posed them, and then they ran it saying, Father Murphy talks to street gangs in Boston, and they were sued.

46:31.257 --> 46:33.239
And immediately they exempted me.

46:33.479 --> 46:36.562
I mean, I sweated, because I had nothing to do with that, you know.

46:36.942 --> 46:38.244
But I don't know how that came out.

46:38.304 --> 46:40.025
They probably settled out of court.

46:40.045 --> 46:47.612
But it always blew my mind that these high-powered magazine photographers didn't know any better than that.

46:47.712 --> 46:48.293
They knew better.

46:48.313 --> 46:49.054
That's just the way they were.

46:49.074 --> 46:50.415
They just took a chance.

46:50.435 --> 46:51.956
They took a chance, yeah.

46:52.437 --> 47:00.184
So this certainly emboldened you now to... Well, Pat, what happened was, through Evan Hill,

47:00.991 --> 47:09.599
I approached his agent, you know, and I got his agent.

47:09.919 --> 47:11.721
That's one of the questions I have.

47:11.741 --> 47:11.841
Yeah.

47:11.861 --> 47:11.961
Okay.

47:11.981 --> 47:13.543
And I got his agent.

47:13.903 --> 47:14.384
Who was?

47:14.664 --> 47:25.454
Well, his agent then was a woman named Connie Smith, who immediately, before I even came on board, resigned because her husband was dying of cancer and she nursed him to death, you know.

47:25.954 --> 47:29.698
But her partner was a woman named Pat Sharple.

47:29.948 --> 47:32.711
And she was my agent for a long time.

47:32.771 --> 47:41.422
And she went to lunch with the Post, and on the basis of the lunch, raised my rate and everything, and I never sold them another piece because they went out of business.

47:41.642 --> 47:44.286
So you got the agent to do magazine work?

47:44.706 --> 47:48.070
I got the agent to do magazine work, but she said, what do you have?

47:48.270 --> 47:53.437
And I had written a couple of... These are PW kinds of questions, by the way.

47:53.477 --> 47:54.698
These are the kinds of stuff.

47:54.718 --> 47:57.422
They like to know how it happens.

47:57.462 --> 47:57.762
Right.

47:57.961 --> 48:02.827
And because we're pressed for a time, we've got an hour, we really have to get into the European stuff.

48:02.887 --> 48:04.629
Okay, I'll race through this.

48:04.649 --> 48:08.434
I'm not pushing you, but I'm mindful of your schedule.

48:08.454 --> 48:13.501
Okay, anyway, I got Pat, and she got me a contract.

48:14.262 --> 48:15.042
A book contract?

48:15.063 --> 48:15.683
A book contract.

48:15.703 --> 48:16.104
With whom?

48:16.284 --> 48:17.225
With McGraw-Hill.

48:17.766 --> 48:19.328
And this was for the rabbi?

48:19.468 --> 48:21.170
This was for the rabbi, yeah.

48:21.671 --> 48:22.932
On the strength of a proposal?

48:23.113 --> 48:25.015
On the strength of a proposal.

48:25.754 --> 48:27.637
How old were you at this time?

48:28.178 --> 48:30.021
At that time I was in my late 30s.

48:33.187 --> 48:43.083
At the Herald I had reached the point where I had my own office, I was away from the city desk, I could make my own assignments, my own hours, everyone let me alone.

48:43.103 --> 48:45.307
I could go where I wanted and cover what I wanted.

48:45.768 --> 48:51.778
I had a dream newspaper job as far as I was concerned and I loved Boston working here.

48:52.130 --> 48:56.235
But I really wanted to do this, and Lorraine said, do it.

48:56.636 --> 48:59.319
But at that time, I had three kids.

48:59.839 --> 49:00.941
By that time, I had three kids.

49:01.001 --> 49:03.424
I had a mortgage in Framingham, you know.

49:06.027 --> 49:09.591
But we had an advance.

49:09.872 --> 49:10.993
I don't remember what it was.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.016
I think it was $7,500 in the beginning.

49:13.076 --> 49:14.317
I'm not sure.

49:14.397 --> 49:15.859
Yeah, I think it was.

49:16.852 --> 49:18.814
I may be wrong.

49:18.874 --> 49:22.097
I could even be wrong, but... I told you what I sold my book for.

49:22.117 --> 49:23.138
It's just two years ago.

49:23.678 --> 49:26.141
Yeah, you didn't, but... $15,000.

49:26.161 --> 49:26.261
Yeah.

49:26.481 --> 49:28.343
Because I was willing to take anything.

49:28.403 --> 49:30.385
Well, that's twice as much as I'm talking about.

49:30.425 --> 49:31.246
This was 1994.

49:31.286 --> 49:34.809
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:35.249 --> 49:38.232
But, so you don't owe them all that advanced.

49:38.252 --> 49:39.133
You're making it now.

49:39.173 --> 49:40.915
You'll get it.

49:41.275 --> 49:43.517
It's coming next month, God willing.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.382
But I don't remember what it was.

49:46.402 --> 49:52.610
It was an advance, and it allowed us to live until the book.

49:53.551 --> 50:00.339
And toward the end, I was really desperate, and I started writing while I was still at the Herald.

50:00.459 --> 50:01.500
So you left the Herald?

50:01.520 --> 50:01.680
Yeah.

50:01.700 --> 50:06.045
First, I took an American newspaper leave of absence for six months.

50:06.065 --> 50:10.230
Then I renewed it for six months, which is all they would allow.

50:10.396 --> 50:15.403
I would have renewed it forever, but they wanted somebody to cover science and medicine.

50:15.723 --> 50:17.846
And I knew that that was only fair, so I resigned.

50:18.567 --> 50:23.614
And I began freelancing when I finished the book.

50:24.315 --> 50:26.698
And during the time I wrote the book.

50:26.839 --> 50:28.120
How long did it take you to write the book?

50:28.721 --> 50:31.385
It took me several years.

50:31.425 --> 50:33.788
Again, see, I wish I could do more.

50:34.169 --> 50:35.570
But let me tell you this.

50:36.171 --> 50:37.433
I was on jury duty.

50:38.172 --> 50:43.920
Just before I was leaving the paper, I was on jury duty in Cambridge.

50:44.601 --> 50:48.646
And I got a call, a notice saying, call your city desk.

50:48.666 --> 50:57.017
And I called, and they told me that Harry Solomon, Dr. Harry Cesar Solomon, the commissioner of mental health of Massachusetts, was trying to get me and call him.

50:57.458 --> 51:02.865
And I called him, and he's the guy I had covered, you know, for a long time as a journalist.

51:02.925 --> 51:06.610
He knew me, and he said, I know where we can get a grant

51:06.944 --> 51:11.349
an NIMH grant to start an experimental journal in psychiatry.

51:11.369 --> 51:12.070
Are you interested?"

51:12.570 --> 51:21.139
And I said, Dr. Solomon, I think that doctors have more than enough to read now, but to tell you the truth, I need the money and I am interested.

51:22.160 --> 51:22.801
Excuse me.

51:23.882 --> 51:32.291
So I had some income from that because while I was writing the book, I got together an editorial board of mental health experts.

51:32.992 --> 51:33.913
I began

51:34.096 --> 52:03.799
looking for papers this was an opinion journal we would take a controversy it was quarterly to begin with i think and we would take a controversy and get two authors that hit themselves at one another it was very interesting and well read and and so i got some money that way and then i began doing cover stories for trying to remember the name of the doctor's magazine so the physician news magazine no not jamma it was

52:03.982 --> 52:04.883
It doesn't matter.

52:05.203 --> 52:05.824
It doesn't matter.

52:05.844 --> 52:08.927
I began freelancing medical articles.

52:09.308 --> 52:11.590
So tell me where the rabbi came out.

52:11.790 --> 52:16.956
Where did this... I'd always wanted to write a book about a rabbi.

52:17.156 --> 52:27.347
Again, not because I was so religious and I'm not... I grew up in a family where... This is in that speech, too.

52:27.367 --> 52:28.708
I won't spend too much time on it.

52:28.728 --> 52:29.208
It's in there.

52:29.669 --> 52:31.010
My grandmother lived with us.

52:31.351 --> 52:33.533
In those days, you lived multi-generationally.

52:34.002 --> 52:36.846
And she was very pious and religious old lady.

52:36.886 --> 52:43.996
And she was, I used her for the character of the grandfather in the rabbi, who was a pious old man who drove everyone nuts.

52:44.957 --> 52:50.124
And she certainly, you know, made us, we kept a strictly kosher home and all that stuff.

52:50.184 --> 52:52.267
And I used to take her to the synagogue and back.

52:52.948 --> 53:01.220
My father, it was a very ethnic man and loved being a Jew, but was a completely free thinker of our religion.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.862
He used to take me to Klan banks and

53:03.145 --> 53:07.931
At the lake, you know, which eats forbidden food and all that stuff.

53:07.951 --> 53:10.654
So, I grew up with these two influences.

53:10.674 --> 53:11.475
The lake being Lake Quincey.

53:11.495 --> 53:12.036
Lake Quincey.

53:12.477 --> 53:17.763
So, I grew up with these two influences, you know, which made for an interesting kind of thing.

53:20.066 --> 53:31.380
But, so, anyway, that, the book came out and was a bestseller and I was tremendously

53:31.681 --> 53:32.742
Tremendously lucky.

53:32.962 --> 53:34.264
You know, I was able... Were you surprised?

53:35.045 --> 53:35.645
Oh, yeah.

53:35.665 --> 53:36.967
I just wanted to survive.

53:37.587 --> 53:42.052
As every writer, every young writer, you know, nobody... Were you surprised?

53:42.132 --> 53:43.514
I mean, you know, you don't know.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.656
You just don't know it's going to be like that.

53:46.077 --> 53:48.559
And isn't it the most wonderful feeling in the world?

53:48.579 --> 53:50.902
A kid, only a kid can beat it.

53:50.922 --> 53:53.405
Having a kid... That's exactly... I agree with you.

53:53.805 --> 53:55.747
I really agree with you.

53:55.767 --> 54:00.152
Because I just couldn't believe it.

54:00.436 --> 54:09.306
Look, all the time I'd worked at the Worcester Telegram and at the Boston Herald, thank God they never knew this, I would have paid them to let me come to work.

54:09.947 --> 54:10.888
I mean, I really would have.

54:10.908 --> 54:11.989
I was so happy.

54:12.009 --> 54:13.731
That's why I review books for Ivan.

54:13.751 --> 54:13.871
Yeah.

54:13.891 --> 54:14.592
They're free.

54:14.612 --> 54:14.893
Yeah.

54:15.053 --> 54:17.656
And when I was book editor, I mean, it was the most exploitive thing.

54:17.676 --> 54:19.998
These people would willingly do it for free.

54:20.038 --> 54:24.003
Yeah, because people want, people who want to write, want to write.

54:24.023 --> 54:26.786
They want to write, and then to be published, to see the thing in print.

54:26.806 --> 54:27.507
Yeah, yeah.

54:27.892 --> 54:57.105
so it was it was heaven you know it was really heaven and i've never worked for anybody since and what happened was we uh the seed money ran out at for the journal yeah and uh we asked hudson hoagland i got i got a grant from huffman la roche an industry grant you know and we asked hudson hoagland to administer it for us at the list of foundation which he did and we were right oh

54:57.710 --> 55:07.624
So I did this to my second book, which I was writing while trying to put out these journals and all that stuff, and I was having trouble.

55:08.265 --> 55:09.708
I didn't want to be a publisher.

55:09.748 --> 55:12.732
I wanted to be a novelist, but I had this thing going.

55:13.773 --> 55:15.456
So I asked Lorraine if she would help me.

55:15.496 --> 55:21.825
She came in and became associate publisher because she didn't want to be called publisher.

55:21.845 --> 55:23.067
I kept the title publisher.

55:23.588 --> 55:27.193
But we published that and another journal that we were asked to publish.

55:27.612 --> 55:36.064
The Journal of Human Stress, which is now called Behavioral Medicine, and is published by a non-profit foundation in Washington, D.C.

55:36.905 --> 55:39.228
But we published those two journals for 16 years.

55:40.290 --> 55:49.042
And it was nice, because it would allow me to go to medical meetings, you know, someplace and see guys I used to cover with and all that stuff.

55:49.102 --> 55:55.431
I think you told me earlier, when we were having breakfast, about the genesis of the idea of the medical novels.

55:55.752 --> 55:55.932
Yeah.

55:56.131 --> 55:58.815
and this clearly is the background.

55:58.955 --> 56:00.878
Briefly, though, the research that you do.

56:00.898 --> 56:02.180
You don't mind jumping around a little bit?

56:02.200 --> 56:05.865
No, there's something I should tell you in connection with that.

56:06.406 --> 56:25.834
It isn't only that I have worked as a medical journalist on newspapers and a medical publisher, but, for example, when I was researching the death committee, I attended mortality conferences at two Boston teaching hospitals, you know?

56:26.354 --> 56:39.293
And there was one point where I wanted to get a little more of the flavor of the operating room, and so I went to a man I knew who was then director of Boston City Hospital.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.575
I can't even give you his name now.

56:40.595 --> 56:41.256
He's a layman.

56:41.677 --> 56:42.478
I don't remember his name.

56:43.019 --> 56:49.128
But I said to him, can I kind of hang around the OR and observe a little?

56:49.148 --> 56:54.977
He said, no, we can't allow that, but if you will take a little training course we have in

56:55.497 --> 57:06.630
in surgical technician, I'll allow you to volunteer as an unpaid.

57:07.091 --> 57:10.475
So I did, but you know what happened?

57:10.495 --> 57:11.556
They weren't crazy.

57:11.976 --> 57:16.041
The only thing they allowed me to do was clean up after dirty, you know, mopping pail stuff.

57:16.322 --> 57:23.530
But between operations, there I was in this now dirty thing, and we were all sitting around while they had a cigarette,

57:23.965 --> 57:30.294
And I wasn't writing, and so they would just talk to me like another person there.

57:30.314 --> 57:33.879
So I got some good stuff for about a couple of months.

57:33.899 --> 57:36.783
And then at one point... That's the way to get the stuff.

57:36.923 --> 57:44.274
At one point, I volunteered at Westboro State Hospital to work on closed wards, also unpaid.

57:45.155 --> 57:50.022
And then when we moved to the hills, we didn't have an ambulance.

57:50.803 --> 57:52.926
So I took training that lasted.

57:53.142 --> 58:00.930
about almost a year, nine months or something, part-time, you know, evenings and weekends, and certified as an emergency medical technician.

58:01.831 --> 58:03.293
I did that for eight and a half years.

58:03.873 --> 58:05.175
This is out in Western Massachusetts.

58:05.195 --> 58:06.036
Out in Western Massachusetts.

58:06.056 --> 58:07.437
You wear a pager in your belt.

58:07.958 --> 58:08.939
The pager goes off.

58:09.399 --> 58:11.181
You run for your pickup truck.

58:11.201 --> 58:12.823
You drive to the firehouse.

58:12.843 --> 58:15.206
Now, what prompted you to move out there, just in fact?

58:15.666 --> 58:17.628
We lived in Framingham.

58:18.389 --> 58:20.311
I had filled three-quarters of an acre.

58:21.072 --> 58:22.153
Every last inch was

58:22.606 --> 58:24.449
some kind of plant, you know.

58:24.950 --> 58:30.518
My kids were out of the house, and I said to Lorraine almost idly one day, would you ever think of living in the country?

58:30.558 --> 58:32.260
And she said, maybe.

58:32.801 --> 58:36.507
And my kids had gone to UMass, and we had been... Amherst.

58:36.527 --> 58:40.172
Amherst, and we had driven into the hills and found them really beautiful.

58:40.773 --> 58:43.638
And I began to look for a piece of land, and I found it.

58:43.778 --> 58:46.101
And about when was that being out there?

58:46.582 --> 58:47.263
About

58:47.952 --> 58:53.538
Well, it would be 18 years now, and it took us like two years to build a house.

58:53.598 --> 58:59.605
Is that about 20 years ago when we first decided to go to this?

58:59.665 --> 59:02.949
Framingham in 59.

59:03.270 --> 59:04.891
Where have you been?

59:04.911 --> 59:05.792
Framingham in when?

59:06.033 --> 59:07.094
September 59.

59:07.114 --> 59:08.696
Oh, see, I don't remember at all.

59:08.776 --> 59:10.238
March of 79.

59:10.858 --> 59:12.961
Do you remember the years in New York?

59:13.722 --> 59:15.023
Yes, from 51.

59:15.357 --> 59:18.482
August, this 51th, February of 56th.

59:18.502 --> 59:21.346
Okay, and do you remember... How long was I at the telegram?

59:22.207 --> 59:23.850
I think it was five years.

59:23.870 --> 59:24.290
I don't know.

59:24.310 --> 59:27.115
I said five years to Tubert, and Tubert said he thought it was West.

59:27.575 --> 59:28.156
I don't remember.

59:28.176 --> 59:29.779
I read it at Tubert.

59:30.219 --> 59:31.521
Oh, you're quoting Tubert now?

59:31.541 --> 59:31.822
No.

59:32.863 --> 59:33.644
No, no, no.

59:33.985 --> 59:35.467
No, Jack thought it was West.

59:35.507 --> 59:36.989
Did he look it up?

59:37.069 --> 59:37.450
I wonder.

59:37.891 --> 59:39.954
I'm sure I've got it written down.

59:40.034 --> 59:40.715
It's a big deal.

59:40.735 --> 59:42.097
I'm sure I've got it written down.

59:42.197 --> 59:42.778
It's a few years.

59:43.138 --> 59:44.841
Yeah, this is maybe...

59:45.074 --> 59:45.975
Four or five years.

59:47.256 --> 59:52.501
In 59, you were already... No, it wasn't five years, because in 59... Jack didn't think it was five years.

59:52.521 --> 59:52.762
Let me talk.

59:53.162 --> 59:53.602
I'm sorry.

59:53.702 --> 59:57.927
The reason we moved to Framingham is because you were commuting from Worcester to Boston.

59:58.047 --> 59:59.048
That's a pretty good drive.

59:59.468 --> 01:00:01.550
Yeah, when I got for Hyde by the Harriet.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:11.520
Well, it couldn't have been, because we moved... It was just a couple of years, because we moved to Worcester in 1956.

01:00:12.277 --> 01:00:13.779
And we left Worcester in 59.

01:00:14.119 --> 01:00:14.720
So, three years.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.521
So, two years.

01:00:16.162 --> 01:00:18.404
I may have the wrong length of time on that speech.

01:00:18.985 --> 01:00:19.326
That's right.

01:00:19.346 --> 01:00:19.926
Don't worry about it.

01:00:19.946 --> 01:00:20.147
Yeah.

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:21.889
I'm going to... I'm going to... Okay.

01:00:22.409 --> 01:00:23.651
Just so I know about this.

01:00:23.731 --> 01:00:24.151
Okay.

01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:29.238
Maureen, what's really important, do you remember when he signed his contract for the first novel?

01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:30.059
With the rabbi?

01:00:30.739 --> 01:00:31.040
With the rabbi.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.761
She'll look it up.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.242
She's got everything.

01:00:33.543 --> 01:00:39.550
I don't know if I have that here, but I'll... Well, yeah, because I'm just... I'm really trying to get into the right... Yeah, because this is a publishing thing.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.013
Well, it was published in...

01:00:42.179 --> 01:00:42.560
65.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:43.542
Okay.

01:00:44.585 --> 01:00:44.946
Yeah.

01:00:45.467 --> 01:00:47.372
So it took about three, four years to write, you figure?

01:00:48.294 --> 01:00:50.961
Maybe that one took, yeah, maybe two or three years.

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:51.362
That's right.

01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:53.226
Publish 65 is fine.

01:00:53.246 --> 01:00:54.069
That's cool.

01:00:54.189 --> 01:00:56.695
Yeah, I think I worked in the paper until 65.
