WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:07.722
What's happening?

00:10.966 --> 00:12.789
What's happening?

00:13.070 --> 00:16.895
Well, as you know, the collection is going up for sale.

00:19.479 --> 00:23.085
And that should be sometime in October.

00:23.105 --> 00:25.488
And some of these.

00:25.508 --> 00:27.932
And we should have a very fine catalog.

00:31.097 --> 00:31.978
I'll...

00:32.431 --> 01:02.050
course miss miss the collection but hopefully uh like jerome kern who uh just before the stock market crash in 29 had the foresight to sell his collection and the next day after the crash he uh started buying all over again and uh i am a absolutely

01:02.401 --> 01:22.623
motivated book collector who cannot pass by a used or antiquarian bookshop, who, as we speak, is planning what he's doing next weekend as far as what book fairs are in a 500-mile radius.

01:22.643 --> 01:32.273
I have not stopped my hunting

01:32.506 --> 01:40.375
and searching for reading material and collecting books.

01:42.538 --> 01:56.495
But it is necessary at this point in my collecting career and in the collecting career of my wife.

01:56.735 --> 02:01.821
As you know, my wife and I collect not only...

02:02.543 --> 02:12.097
I collect rare books, but my wife and I collect together American paintings, and furniture, and artiques.

02:12.478 --> 02:26.679
And we've been known to... We've been known to... Mises has been written about us, that their data can go by that we don't acquire something.

02:26.699 --> 02:29.884
And does that continue to this day?

02:30.353 --> 02:31.594
That still continues.

02:31.674 --> 02:41.505
It's very difficult to stop a generation, at least, of collecting habits.

02:42.927 --> 02:45.589
But what we found is that we want to pare down.

02:47.311 --> 02:51.216
We're going to move into smaller quarters.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.044
And it just won't be the opportunity

02:59.446 --> 03:15.872
is to keep a fine, rare book collection of the size and scope of this one.

03:15.892 --> 03:27.090
And therefore, although we give away most, up to this point in time, although we give away most of the collection,

03:28.538 --> 03:37.031
What we normally do, just so you have an idea, is we believe that putting... You want to stop it for once in a while?

03:37.051 --> 03:37.191
Sure.

03:37.812 --> 03:40.857
I say you're not going to... You're going to extract from anyone.

03:41.357 --> 03:41.538
Okay.

03:41.798 --> 03:43.681
But if something you have, you put it on.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.265
If you'd like, you can see the books at some of these at any time.

03:46.585 --> 03:47.026
Number one.

03:48.067 --> 03:53.716
Number two, I'd like you to see the context of where the books were, so you'd understand.

03:54.217 --> 03:56.520
And it's very important, because when you write about it,

03:56.804 --> 03:58.586
My end.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.989
I think I want you to understand the home that these books were in.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.431
I want you to understand the library that was built for these books.

04:06.473 --> 04:09.475
And I think that when you see this, it's going to blow you.

04:09.495 --> 04:10.837
I don't mean to do this to you.

04:10.857 --> 04:11.197
It will.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.459
I'm not bragging.

04:13.759 --> 04:15.681
I want to give you the kind of material.

04:17.202 --> 04:26.811
See, what I have done, it's a renaissance kind of thing.

04:27.533 --> 04:31.583
I'm going to blow my horn only because I'm trying to give you material.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.860
Some people might think it's blowing your horn, by the way.

04:39.278 --> 04:42.001
just so I can give you information.

04:42.061 --> 04:43.223
I want to give you a context.

04:43.243 --> 04:47.488
I saw stuff at the Grollier Club, too, so I know the quality of the stuff we're talking about.

04:47.528 --> 04:48.750
And the Shakespeare's weren't there.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.731
Right, exactly.

04:49.751 --> 04:51.613
And the King James Bible wasn't there.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.135
There were 200 items that weren't there anymore.

04:53.155 --> 04:55.217
Yeah, and I'm sure that they were probably the most valuable.

04:55.237 --> 04:58.281
Yeah, there's things I didn't want to send down because it wasn't value.

04:59.623 --> 05:02.346
So, I mean, I know the quality of the material that we're talking about.

05:02.366 --> 05:02.807
Exactly.

05:04.008 --> 05:04.268
I know.

05:04.369 --> 05:05.510
I've seen some of them.

05:06.151 --> 05:06.912
Well, let me tell you this.

05:07.032 --> 05:08.053
I want you to see...

05:08.624 --> 05:11.767
the objects that surrounded the material.

05:12.628 --> 05:16.571
I want you to see the home the material was in, the library, the physical library.

05:17.052 --> 05:36.370
I want you to understand that what I wanted to reconstruct, what I wanted to reconstruct, being a collector since the last 28 years, not a book collector, but an all-around collector, book collecting, used books, that's always been

05:37.025 --> 05:41.091
and acquire, I've always acquired used books, and aquarium books.

05:41.111 --> 05:48.782
It's only been like a 10 year, give or take a 10 year passion.

05:48.802 --> 06:03.302
And what I did was, I built, we built, we took a 1920s home, and we,

06:03.586 --> 06:15.963
redid it in federal style to accommodate the furniture and antiques that we collect.

06:20.970 --> 06:29.222
And then we built a library

06:29.523 --> 06:45.005
Actually, the building, the extension of our home, the wing of the house, the wing of the house was taken down, and this wing was built to accommodate the collection, the library collection, the book collection.

06:45.025 --> 06:58.264
And when you visit, you will see the Georgian-style Chippendale furniture, the two tiers

06:59.459 --> 07:27.458
with staircase because what I always wanted as a young person when I first started collecting after I was married collecting antiques we would visit these old marvelous homes and not only here in the States but around the world and we'd visit these libraries and we're in these homes and I said one day if I could only reconstruct

07:28.687 --> 07:48.586
that feeling, bring back the 19th or 18th century as a physical presence, as a way of housing these wonderful books that I wanted to collect.

07:50.168 --> 07:52.490
I would really get a kick out of that.

07:53.511 --> 07:55.453
And so we did it.

07:55.973 --> 07:56.915
So I want you to come see that.

07:57.356 --> 07:58.158
Okay.

07:58.198 --> 07:59.601
I really hope that we get a chance.

07:59.621 --> 08:02.066
Please, in the next few weeks or whenever you're free, you'll let me know.

08:02.507 --> 08:03.088
You'll come down.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.050
You'll have dinner.

08:04.231 --> 08:05.113
I've got it on tape.

08:05.714 --> 08:06.696
You've got it on tape so you know.

08:06.876 --> 08:09.522
All right.

08:09.542 --> 08:09.843
Say that again.

08:09.863 --> 08:10.163
Say that again.

08:10.183 --> 08:10.564
Very important.

08:10.584 --> 08:13.130
You want me to understand something that's very important.

08:13.150 --> 08:15.214
I don't know exactly what Peter told you.

08:15.234 --> 08:16.497
But let me tell you something.

08:16.679 --> 08:18.381
We shall put it in this proper context.

08:19.362 --> 08:37.060
What Peter might have told you is that Peter built... Peter and his associate, whose name I want to give you, because it's his associate who really was the movie person.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.302
I'm writing this down, too.

08:39.322 --> 08:41.365
If you just remind me, I'll keep his name... Okay.

08:41.445 --> 08:44.728
I'm writing this down.

08:45.181 --> 08:55.574
They really suggested to me many, many of the titles I acquired from them.

08:56.155 --> 08:57.937
And they truly built that collection for me.

08:59.038 --> 08:59.339
Okay?

09:00.360 --> 09:03.184
But my book collection was built by me.

09:04.625 --> 09:09.972
As everything else that I collected in my life, I make the choices of what I want to buy.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.217
Very important.

09:14.237 --> 09:14.338
Okay.

09:14.598 --> 09:14.698
Okay.

09:16.147 --> 09:16.748
I'm back on.

09:18.973 --> 09:24.304
Why is it necessary for you to sell your books right now?

09:24.344 --> 09:32.721
I understand this could be a delicate question, but my assumption is that if you had your drubbers, you wouldn't sell them right now.

09:34.805 --> 09:36.889
I'm trying to be delicate.

09:37.493 --> 09:59.029
We've made a definite decision to move into

09:59.380 --> 10:06.530
My daughter was married a couple of years ago.

10:06.650 --> 10:15.583
There are two of us, Lori and I. We have this huge 30,000-square-foot house.

10:16.764 --> 10:19.047
30,000-square-foot house?

10:19.448 --> 10:20.109
You come and you'll see.

10:20.129 --> 10:23.153
I don't like the sargo assembly.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.236
And it's just...

10:25.688 --> 10:38.357
And a collection that is, you know, just becoming burdensome at this point on a physical basis.

10:38.377 --> 10:44.350
In order to pare down, we've got to start selling things.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.132
The problem...

10:45.550 --> 11:00.887
that I've got at this moment is that since we collect mostly American things in our furniture antiques and paintings, that market is dead at the moment.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.710
You mean the market itself?

11:03.870 --> 11:04.551
The market itself.

11:04.611 --> 11:05.692
In other words, the selling market.

11:06.533 --> 11:11.699
Selling at auction at this point, you wouldn't realize... So you would probably sell other things if the market was there.

11:11.759 --> 11:12.200
Exactly.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.342
But the problem that I have at this point

11:14.609 --> 11:20.036
is that the only market that's alive and kicking is the rare book market.

11:22.719 --> 11:24.762
And therefore, I had to bite the bullet.

11:25.042 --> 11:34.054
And since the rare book collection is mine, and Gloria, my wife, really has no interest in it.

11:34.074 --> 11:35.756
By interest, I don't mean financial interest.

11:35.776 --> 11:40.482
I mean no physical interest in it.

11:41.322 --> 11:42.804
You got it first to tell you.

11:42.824 --> 11:43.885
You haven't done it jointly.

11:43.985 --> 11:47.210
No, this was not done jointly.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.471
As was everything else.

11:48.611 --> 12:01.628
I decided, being that I could do something to alleviate the situation and start the ball rolling.

12:01.648 --> 12:05.153
We're looking for new quarters right now and my house is for sale.

12:07.462 --> 12:18.877
To start the ball rolling, I decided to sell the collection, the book collection, because we could realize, hopefully, a profitable result from the sale.

12:25.767 --> 12:30.313
And if we were to sell any of our art or antiques,

12:30.952 --> 12:37.160
we would realize much less than the true value.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.926
With the sale of rare books, we will get the true value, because rare books have held the market.

12:41.946 --> 12:47.052
Well, do you think that you'll get $2 million for the Shakespeare's in fewer than two years after you bought them?

12:47.072 --> 12:49.435
I mean, there's a phrase, fresh on the market.

12:49.716 --> 12:57.786
I feel that the Shakespeare's may or may not...

12:58.255 --> 13:01.859
realize their potential.

13:01.879 --> 13:05.363
Well, never mind their potential, but their investments.

13:05.383 --> 13:10.068
May or may not realize their investments.

13:10.088 --> 13:21.581
And at this point in time, I may have second thoughts, although I've committed the situation.

13:23.082 --> 13:27.267
I really believe that everything else that I have in this election

13:27.685 --> 13:36.595
will realize not only what I paid for it, but a great increase.

13:37.336 --> 13:43.063
And therefore, that will make up any slack that the Shakespeare's may have not realized.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.125
Of course, there was an underbidder there, too.

13:45.145 --> 13:45.846
We have to remember that.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.327
That's right.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.228
There was an underbidder there.

13:47.248 --> 13:48.569
We don't know who the underbidder was.

13:48.790 --> 13:49.230
No, we don't.

13:49.551 --> 13:49.791
Do you?

13:50.251 --> 13:50.772
No, we don't.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.355
Do you think it was a Japanese guy?

13:53.572 --> 13:55.936
It is definitely a Japanese guy.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.640
Well, there is a Japanese guy who collects Shakespeare.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.261
I don't know his name.

13:59.382 --> 14:00.944
I haven't, but I don't have a look at it.

14:01.164 --> 14:03.929
I was told that that was who it was.

14:04.109 --> 14:04.290
Okay.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.512
I don't know his name.

14:05.832 --> 14:07.074
I have his name at home.

14:07.295 --> 14:09.518
I was told that secondhand, and it may not have been.

14:09.538 --> 14:14.126
I was not told that by Sotheby's.

14:14.206 --> 14:18.533
Sotheby's is one of the reluctant, and rightly so, to give out their sources.

14:19.745 --> 14:25.873
I would expect them to be in the same fashion as you were first.

14:29.297 --> 14:49.262
Most importantly, we feel that the total result of the upcoming sale in October for the rare book collection will more than cover

14:50.086 --> 14:50.707
the investment?

14:51.027 --> 14:53.070
No, not only the investment, but my expectations.

14:54.152 --> 14:57.978
But what is very important is this.

14:57.998 --> 15:05.529
At no time have we ever bought an object or a rare book for investment.

15:05.549 --> 15:09.474
That's consistent with what you say in that interview, by the way.

15:09.494 --> 15:09.675
Okay?

15:09.715 --> 15:11.117
Thank you.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.599
I don't have to say that, but it is.

15:13.721 --> 15:16.124
If there's any consistency, I'd jump by here with it.

15:16.144 --> 15:16.785
Please.

15:18.031 --> 15:22.457
But the point is, everything that you've said is consistent with what it will be 15 months ago.

15:22.477 --> 15:23.078
That's marvelous.

15:23.398 --> 15:26.082
They're going through examination before trial, and they use it against you.

15:26.523 --> 15:29.407
I'm not, you know, I may look easy, but I'm not.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.049
You're not an easy guy.

15:31.109 --> 15:32.611
I've got some tough questions for you.

15:32.651 --> 15:33.132
I hope so.

15:33.472 --> 15:34.614
All right, let's go to the next one.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.275
Are you ready?

15:35.475 --> 15:35.715
Sure.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.478
All right.

15:37.498 --> 15:45.068
You must realize that the talk on the street is that you need the money, that you're in trouble financially, and that this is why you're selling the books.

15:45.605 --> 15:54.940
I'm not telling you anything you haven't heard.

15:54.960 --> 15:55.982
Right now, fees are tight.

15:59.608 --> 16:00.790
We're selling and tearing down.

16:02.853 --> 16:04.616
I think it's consistent with what I told you before.

16:05.558 --> 16:08.102
You're asking me what my motivation is.

16:08.122 --> 16:08.743
Now I can tell you.

16:10.883 --> 16:13.586
The trick is never to volunteer unless you're at it.

16:13.606 --> 16:18.390
I wouldn't have any Air Force.

16:18.410 --> 16:22.514
I know I'm not dealing with a pussycat, by the way.

16:22.534 --> 16:24.196
You are the mediator, by the way.

16:24.216 --> 16:24.536
Thank you.

16:24.596 --> 16:27.158
Capital P and capital M. Well, thank you.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.661
This recession has affected many people.

16:30.401 --> 16:31.863
It's affected us.

16:32.664 --> 16:39.490
And to be able to realize

16:40.246 --> 16:41.207
some appreciable monies.

16:43.049 --> 16:49.996
At this point in time, being a true collector, usually puts much of his liquid assets into the collection.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.860
That's nothing new, I'm sure, among collectors.

16:53.880 --> 17:08.194
In order to become more liquid, so that I can take advantage of opportunities, business opportunities that have come our way, very, very important.

17:08.528 --> 17:13.674
To get liquid now, where am I going to get liquid from?

17:13.694 --> 17:18.860
The easiest way is to find a marketplace that is still holding its own.

17:20.042 --> 17:21.003
Jesus, that's good.

17:21.023 --> 17:22.525
With a loss, with a loss.

17:22.925 --> 17:24.707
Where I don't have to take a loss.

17:25.989 --> 17:31.976
By a loss, I don't mean, well, paintings 15 years ago, even if I sold them today, I wouldn't take a loss.

17:31.996 --> 17:32.677
I don't mean it that way.

17:32.697 --> 17:33.798
Can I just interrupt, please?

17:33.818 --> 17:36.622
This is just exactly what I said in my piece.

17:36.642 --> 17:37.843
Everything else is gone.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.029
But books.

17:40.050 --> 17:41.191
So you've seen this.

17:42.072 --> 17:42.673
Absolutely.

17:42.693 --> 17:44.856
And you said, well, I hate to do it, but.

17:45.116 --> 17:45.997
But.

17:46.017 --> 17:47.820
And again, I want to be like Jerome Kern.

17:49.141 --> 17:49.622
To me.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.584
Who bailed out nine months before the crash.

17:51.604 --> 18:00.996
I want to bail out at a time when I can realize some realistic money for the collection.

18:01.016 --> 18:06.042
And at the same time, be in a position to start again on a new collection.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.193
And you're a young guy.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.054
There's no reason why I can't.

18:08.074 --> 18:08.956
I have no reason why I can't.

18:09.016 --> 18:10.538
After all, forget your own current.

18:11.058 --> 18:16.346
When Bradley Martin had that wonderful sale, it was his second collection.

18:16.366 --> 18:17.147
Or have we forgotten?

18:18.689 --> 18:21.472
You're making me search my mind, actually.

18:21.693 --> 18:33.008
I think you said to me in the earlier interview that you believe in the next generation of collectors.

18:33.241 --> 18:35.285
I asked you that before.

18:35.305 --> 18:36.807
I said, what happens to this collection?

18:36.928 --> 18:42.738
And I thought that maybe because you had been so generous to the Metropolitan, why not give it to a university?

18:43.239 --> 18:49.390
Why not have the Richard Manny rare book collection ensconced in some place?

18:49.771 --> 18:52.055
And you said, hey, you know, I get a kick out of this.

18:53.117 --> 18:57.645
There's nothing here that cannot be replicated in some scholarly research library.

18:57.963 --> 19:00.728
We're talking about a book, we're not talking necessarily about a manuscript.

19:00.768 --> 19:01.850
Right.

19:01.870 --> 19:06.698
So collectors, where would I be if the collectors didn't give this stuff?

19:06.718 --> 19:07.279
So you said that.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.060
It's right here.

19:08.641 --> 19:10.444
So you really haven't contradicted yourself.

19:10.505 --> 19:10.665
No.

19:11.186 --> 19:16.014
And I want to reiterate... So rest assured that I haven't really trapped you in any contradiction.

19:16.435 --> 19:17.116
Please.

19:17.216 --> 19:18.538
No, it's not my intention to do that.

19:18.859 --> 19:21.844
A, it's not your intention, but B, you'll never find me in a contradiction.

19:21.824 --> 19:23.106
Because you said that.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.068
I give it to you straight.

19:24.088 --> 19:28.376
When times were wonderful, 15 months into question.

19:28.396 --> 19:30.520
I mean, the world was my oyster.

19:31.341 --> 19:32.263
And it will be again.

19:32.383 --> 19:32.944
I'm smart.

19:33.084 --> 19:40.357
As it has been, we've gone through three cycles like this since I'm in business for myself 33 years.

19:42.081 --> 19:46.228
Since I'm 22 years old, I've been in business for myself.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.571
Can we talk about the business, by the way?

19:48.591 --> 19:49.252
Of course you can.

19:49.452 --> 19:50.614
Just so I can know what you do.

19:50.654 --> 19:51.435
Absolutely.

19:51.475 --> 19:51.975
But go ahead.

19:52.015 --> 19:53.177
Yes.

19:53.798 --> 19:56.841
And I've seen three of these cycles.

19:59.625 --> 20:12.141
And there's no question that in the next couple of years, everything will be turned around again and be as wonderful financially as it has been in the past.

20:12.161 --> 20:15.405
I want to be ready.

20:15.959 --> 20:28.636
with some expendable cash to take advantage of opportunities when they come about.

20:28.656 --> 20:38.029
And these opportunities don't necessarily have to be investment opportunities in my collecting, but they have to be the ability to buy something that I want to have.

20:39.571 --> 20:44.818
Since we only buy the best of what we can afford,

20:45.035 --> 20:46.958
I want to be ready with the cash to do that.

20:48.461 --> 21:08.114
And where I've been able to, for 33 years, take the cash out of my businesses on a continual basis to help my collecting fever, or actually our collecting fever.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.738
I love that phrase, but I'm writing it down right now.

21:10.921 --> 21:19.173
Because business isn't good at this point in time, I have to find that cash from other places.

21:20.395 --> 21:24.842
Most people, I mean, you know, all of a sudden, you're looking at Dick Manning, he's got to... Do you need the money?

21:25.643 --> 21:26.644
We're going to answer this.

21:26.664 --> 21:30.510
All of a sudden, you're looking at Dick Manning... I'm sorry to ask the very straight angle, you're asking a question, though.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.012
I was answering it as you asked the question.

21:32.092 --> 21:40.084
All of a sudden, people looking at Dick Manning, and probably a lot of other people, having to sell some of their objects in order to get some cash.

21:41.110 --> 21:42.152
The answer is very simple.

21:42.933 --> 21:49.465
For 33 years, I have never sold an object, literally, in order to get cash to buy new objects.

21:51.249 --> 21:57.500
99 and 9 tenths of every collector in the world sells part of his collection to acquire new things.

21:59.223 --> 22:01.347
I have always fought not to do that.

22:01.828 --> 22:03.912
That's why we have a tremendous collection.

22:03.932 --> 22:04.553
Colin Franklin.

22:04.870 --> 22:05.933
Leonard Baskin.

22:06.053 --> 22:06.735
Exactly.

22:06.755 --> 22:09.001
He calls himself an argent something or another.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.545
It's a French phrase.

22:10.565 --> 22:11.548
Argent provocateur.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.897
Well, I am a seller-collector.

22:15.498 --> 22:16.601
Exactly.

22:16.701 --> 22:20.010
That to nourish the collection, I have to sell...

22:20.092 --> 22:21.654
I build up on what I sell.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.737
So, I mean, there is... Every collector does this.

22:23.977 --> 22:26.160
We have never had to do that.

22:26.180 --> 22:31.887
So now, for the first time, because we're really in a very deep recession, the business cannot... Is it a deep recession?

22:31.907 --> 22:36.593
My profits from my business cannot sustain my collecting habit.

22:36.613 --> 22:39.757
Our collecting habit, forgive me.

22:39.777 --> 22:41.479
Yeah, but you're only selling books, though.

22:41.499 --> 22:48.208
I have started just to sell my books, because I'm afraid to sell anything else, because there's no market right now for...

22:48.712 --> 22:57.620
I'm not going to get the value back on the antiques and other objects that I can get for the books.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.902
So if I have to sell anything, unfortunately, I've got to sell the books.

22:59.922 --> 23:03.846
But the interesting thing about the books is I can buy them again.

23:04.286 --> 23:05.327
Well, you told me, though.

23:05.367 --> 23:08.009
Now, here is the first inconsistency.

23:08.029 --> 23:13.014
That in my heart of hearts, I will never see a Shakespeare set like that again.

23:13.294 --> 23:16.337
Yes, in my heart of hearts, I will never see a Shakespeare set like that again.

23:17.037 --> 23:17.858
But maybe you will.

23:19.188 --> 23:20.711
You know the funny thing is?

23:20.752 --> 23:28.810
I don't mean to put words in your mouth.

23:28.850 --> 23:31.035
I hope it's going to be published, even in the article.

23:31.375 --> 23:34.021
No article will be put in the article.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.064
You've got to promise me that.

23:35.084 --> 23:36.026
About what I'm going to say.

23:36.106 --> 23:37.028
About what I'm going to say.

23:37.379 --> 23:38.740
The rest you can talk about.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.701
The rest you can talk about.

23:39.721 --> 23:40.182
No, no, no, no.

23:40.202 --> 23:41.243
This could hurt my sale.

23:41.383 --> 23:42.784
No, no, no, no, no.

23:42.804 --> 23:47.429
This is very important for you to say, because if I score the thing with the times... In the books, it's fine.

23:47.549 --> 23:48.290
In the book, it's fine.

23:48.570 --> 23:49.091
Thank you.

23:49.131 --> 23:50.772
I think it's the other way around.

23:50.832 --> 23:51.032
Yeah.

23:51.233 --> 23:54.316
The book is coming out after October, right?

23:54.336 --> 23:55.757
Right.

23:55.777 --> 23:56.638
October of next year.

23:56.778 --> 23:56.918
Good.

23:56.938 --> 23:57.859
Enjoy your lunch.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.361
Would you like a glass of wine?

23:59.381 --> 24:01.062
Only if Mr. Manny has one.

24:01.082 --> 24:03.765
Do you have one?

24:04.265 --> 24:04.686
All right.

24:05.306 --> 24:05.867
Let's have it.

24:07.045 --> 24:13.832
I'm glad you made that distinction.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.173
I'm letting the machine run.

24:16.034 --> 24:20.999
Now it's important for me to tell you this, because I half pitched an idea to the New York Times for a column.

24:22.040 --> 24:22.401
Do it.

24:22.441 --> 24:23.081
Write about me.

24:23.282 --> 24:24.082
And I write about you.

24:24.683 --> 24:30.369
What I'm going to tell you now, I wouldn't want in the column before the sale, but it'll kill the sale of Shakespeare.

24:30.529 --> 24:32.631
Let me tell you what I want to tell you.

24:32.847 --> 24:36.251
I don't want to fuck anybody in any way.

24:36.832 --> 24:41.338
And I said the word, and then you can put it down in the transcript.

24:41.358 --> 24:43.120
But I don't have a copy.

24:43.341 --> 24:44.081
I'm going to give you one.

24:44.122 --> 24:44.923
You want a copy?

24:44.963 --> 24:45.583
You can copy it.

24:46.124 --> 24:46.825
You can have your tapes.

24:46.925 --> 24:47.386
Not a problem.

24:47.406 --> 24:47.786
Listen to me.

24:47.906 --> 24:48.928
I'm straight here.

24:48.948 --> 24:50.430
Please, let me give a second.

24:52.933 --> 25:00.002
Subsequent to my purchase of the Shakespeare's, I believe subsequent, I really got in depth

25:00.353 --> 25:09.905
with how many Shakespeare's are out there in library and university collections, in public collections.

25:09.925 --> 25:26.326
It is my strong belief that there will come a time when some of the collections, the public collections, the library collections, will hold these Shakespeare folios.

25:26.346 --> 25:29.871
They will start to sell some of them off to raise money

25:30.408 --> 25:32.110
because they will have no other choice.

25:33.391 --> 25:41.661
Just like the Barnes collection in Philadelphia, starting to sell some of its impressions to God, you're going to find the same thing happening.

25:43.422 --> 25:47.347
Is it the Meineke, which has all the... The quartos.

25:47.587 --> 25:51.491
All the quartos and all the... Do you know how many folios they have?

25:51.972 --> 25:54.875
No, the Folger has all the... The Folger, I mean the Folgers.

25:56.397 --> 25:59.200
The Folger is my belief.

25:59.872 --> 26:08.179
And I have no reason, and no one has told me this, but I believe that if push comes to shove, if all you need is money, they start to sell something.

26:08.199 --> 26:08.721
They got $100 million.

26:08.982 --> 26:10.346
That's right, exactly.

26:10.366 --> 26:11.610
So what's one or two?

26:11.731 --> 26:12.413
Or two or three.

26:13.017 --> 26:26.209
And so I feel that there'll be tremendous opportunity to purchase Shakespeare again when I deem it the appropriate time to do it.

26:26.229 --> 26:27.771
And if you want him at that point in your life.

26:30.053 --> 26:31.915
Yes.

26:31.935 --> 26:32.295
Who knows?

26:32.976 --> 26:37.360
I collected things 15 years ago that I'm not even slightly interested in now.

26:37.380 --> 26:37.560
Right.

26:37.580 --> 26:42.805
Not to say that I put Shakespeare in that category, but my point is we change, tastes change.

26:43.493 --> 26:52.484
Another tough question?

26:52.504 --> 26:53.005
You don't mind?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.008
Okay.

26:56.028 --> 27:02.096
I mean, people say that you bought a lot of these books with Selfie's money, not Dick Manning's money.

27:02.156 --> 27:03.798
Is that true or is that false?

27:04.218 --> 27:08.944
Never in the history of the world have I borrowed a nickel to buy anything.

27:09.380 --> 27:14.045
in my antique and art collection.

27:14.105 --> 27:18.930
Never ever did I borrow... Oh, forgive me.

27:20.071 --> 27:20.811
Say it a different way.

27:23.254 --> 27:25.796
Don't get mad at me for asking the question.

27:25.816 --> 27:32.143
The Shakespeare folios that I purchased, I was given a year to pay the bill.

27:33.584 --> 27:34.425
So much down.

27:36.093 --> 27:43.202
I was given an extended period of time to pay the bill on the Shakespeare folios.

27:44.143 --> 27:48.068
Over a 12-month period, I had to pay so much in certain periods during that 12 months.

27:48.789 --> 27:51.953
That's the only deal I ever made in my life in buying books.

27:51.974 --> 27:56.399
So did you pay at all?

27:56.419 --> 28:00.885
No, I paid all but a million and change, all but a million and two.

28:01.760 --> 28:16.438
And when I decide to sell my books, I allow celebrities to take the $2.2 million off from the proceeds of sale.

28:16.458 --> 28:17.599
Wow.

28:17.619 --> 28:21.664
That's good.

28:21.684 --> 28:27.451
The next logical question, then, is that selfies are not dictating the sale.

28:27.551 --> 28:28.833
They are not demanding the sale.

28:29.213 --> 28:30.535
Oh, of course.

28:31.797 --> 28:32.498
Oh, God, no.

28:34.960 --> 28:50.395
I could have, if I wanted to, wrote them a check with a million in change, or I could have given them a million in change worth of other options.

28:50.415 --> 28:51.376
Which you could do easily.

28:52.437 --> 28:55.940
I could have given them back to Shakespeare's and kept my book collection.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.001
Right?

28:57.021 --> 29:00.825
Shakespeare with two million in change, right?

29:01.227 --> 29:03.069
I would have a million and change.

29:04.030 --> 29:05.191
A million two, I think.

29:05.211 --> 29:05.872
Or one or whatever.

29:05.892 --> 29:06.552
A million one.

29:09.055 --> 29:17.363
So I could have given it back to Shakespeare's, which was sure going to get a million won at any sale, and therefore I'm off the hook.

29:17.383 --> 29:19.545
So I'm not selling my book collection to satisfy Sotheby's.

29:20.245 --> 29:20.766
Read my lips.

29:21.967 --> 29:23.048
Very important.

29:23.068 --> 29:23.609
OK, say it again.

29:23.809 --> 29:31.116
I'm not selling my book collection to satisfy Sotheby's because my book collection

29:31.501 --> 29:40.454
We'll have a, and this is in a very bad market, a low of 4.6 or 7 and a high of 7 point something.

29:41.956 --> 29:43.157
A million.

29:49.346 --> 29:55.234
So when did the books leave your house to go to York Avenue to go to South Beach?

29:55.314 --> 29:56.616
Three or four weeks ago.

29:56.656 --> 29:57.998
Were you there when this happened?

29:58.535 --> 30:00.578
I was there when it happened, and how did you feel?

30:02.821 --> 30:18.182
Surprisingly, once I make a decision, there's very little in life, there's very little in life that affects me in my gut.

30:18.202 --> 30:22.888
The only thing that affects me in my gut is my wife and my child.

30:23.999 --> 30:32.975
Everything else is a perfect voice.

30:32.995 --> 30:33.255
Wonderful.

30:35.479 --> 30:36.701
See, you could actually be a Greek.

30:37.663 --> 30:38.644
I sure could.

30:38.664 --> 30:39.927
I sure could.

30:39.987 --> 30:42.150
I know in my heart somewhere I've got Mediterranean blood.

30:42.211 --> 30:44.495
I've got to set this up for a second, all right?

30:44.535 --> 30:45.957
This is not for publication.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.632
Well, you don't want to get ripped off.

30:48.373 --> 30:52.558
I don't want my daughter to have a kidnapping scare like she had when she was a kid.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.881
But I'm selling my books.

30:54.901 --> 30:55.542
It's bullshit.

30:56.443 --> 30:58.186
My collection's worth $100 million.

30:59.647 --> 31:00.509
The books or the art?

31:00.529 --> 31:03.132
No, my art, my aunt, he goes with $100 million.

31:04.474 --> 31:06.737
The books are superfluous financially.

31:08.279 --> 31:13.986
I just don't want to sell any part of that $100 million and take a whacking,

31:14.675 --> 31:16.557
I want to say a whacking loss.

31:17.058 --> 31:24.407
What we want to say is, I don't want to take any loss, but if I wait two years, I'll get all that profit that I'm entitled to for all the years I've had this stuff.

31:25.068 --> 31:28.152
The books, I'm not going to take the loss on because they're holding their value.

31:28.573 --> 31:31.577
I can use some money right now, so I've got to sell the books.

31:31.597 --> 31:37.284
But I've got enough assets to go back and buy those books again in spades.

31:37.644 --> 31:38.766
You come to the house and see.

31:39.086 --> 31:39.747
You'll understand.

31:42.090 --> 31:43.291
Now, why are you moving out of the house?

31:43.352 --> 31:44.513
It's too big.

31:44.678 --> 31:47.322
Yeah, but you told me you just died seven years ago.

31:47.342 --> 31:48.523
That's recent.

31:48.804 --> 31:50.466
But the time moves quickly in your life.

31:50.706 --> 31:53.130
The problem is that my wife is ill.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.375
I don't have to use this right now.

31:57.475 --> 31:58.036
My wife is ill.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.379
She doesn't want the strain.

32:02.222 --> 32:06.247
Having to run a 30,000 square foot house.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.074
You understand when you see it now.

32:12.370 --> 32:15.313
And yes, I can use some money.

32:15.333 --> 32:19.817
As a collector, I spent all my liquid income in my disease.

32:20.197 --> 32:24.561
I've got to get liquid.

32:24.581 --> 32:25.542
This is true.

32:25.702 --> 32:27.124
And this you can print.

32:27.144 --> 32:27.924
This you can print.

32:27.944 --> 32:29.866
I'm laughing because it's such a great quote.

32:29.886 --> 32:31.348
I've got to get liquid.

32:31.368 --> 32:32.649
Now, what am I going to get liquid with?

32:33.069 --> 32:34.330
Something I'm going to take a deep loss?

32:34.350 --> 32:35.111
I'm a businessman.

32:35.131 --> 32:37.393
I'm a successful businessman.

32:37.413 --> 32:40.036
Since I'm 23 years old, I've been in business for myself.

32:40.056 --> 32:41.517
I've got enough smarts to know.

32:43.100 --> 32:49.449
If I'm going to sell anything of what I collect, I'm going to sell what I can at least, what at least has maintained the price.

32:50.851 --> 32:51.712
Should I go and sell?

32:53.074 --> 32:59.122
I'll go and sell a child Hassam, which is probably one of the three finest Hassams that he's ever painted.

32:59.182 --> 33:02.286
You know, I have every Hassam book, every illustration.

33:02.326 --> 33:03.488
It's four foot long.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.503
It was done.

33:05.563 --> 33:06.726
It was done.

33:07.347 --> 33:08.790
It's the root bone apart.

33:09.893 --> 33:12.278
That alone, in good times, I'll get $10 million.

33:13.882 --> 33:17.590
At one point in time, at the right time, I'll get $10 million.

33:17.610 --> 33:18.532
I'm going to sell it now.

33:19.775 --> 33:21.679
I have to have my head examined.

33:22.469 --> 33:23.691
That's what I'm talking about.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.333
What did you pay for it?

33:25.353 --> 33:36.911
I paid close to a million dollars for it.

33:37.592 --> 33:49.050
American impressionist art from the two or three great American impressions will skyrocket in the next 10 years.

33:49.604 --> 33:58.155
To a point beyond belief, I'm sitting with one of the three pictures of the greatest American painter of impressionist art.

33:58.335 --> 34:00.358
I agree.

34:00.378 --> 34:01.559
I'm saying $10 million.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.802
Who knows what it will be worth in a good market?

34:04.763 --> 34:10.110
Because no one is going to be able to, very few people are going to be able to afford French impressionism.

34:10.850 --> 34:11.952
The great stuff.

34:12.292 --> 34:20.624
Well, I wonder if anybody's going to be able to afford Charles Hassam or Travis Akins, you know, at some point.

34:20.644 --> 34:24.970
But at least I may be one of the lucky guys who so much to pay $30 million for paying for it.

34:25.851 --> 34:26.552
Isn't that wonderful?

34:26.932 --> 34:27.473
It could happen.

34:27.533 --> 34:31.539
You know, Elizabeth Taylor had a Van Gogh, was it, that they brought in.

34:33.161 --> 34:34.663
Even though she paid nothing for it.

34:34.981 --> 34:35.922
They said, screw that.

34:36.222 --> 34:37.303
We're not going to get its value.

34:37.964 --> 34:38.905
Am I right or am I wrong?

34:39.045 --> 34:42.869
The reason for that was?

34:42.909 --> 34:44.551
The same thing that you're saying.

34:44.571 --> 34:46.393
She sold it at the time the market started going down.

34:46.413 --> 34:46.873
She didn't sell it.

34:46.933 --> 34:47.574
They bought it in.

34:47.594 --> 34:49.556
I mean, she tried to sell it at the time the market was going down.

34:54.661 --> 34:56.563
I don't think she paid $200,000 or $300,000 for it.

34:57.004 --> 34:57.705
Right.

34:57.785 --> 34:59.146
I don't think she paid a million for it.

35:01.348 --> 35:03.891
What's the most you've ever paid for anything?

35:04.124 --> 35:07.151
I mean, in collecting.

35:07.171 --> 35:08.153
Shakespeare.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.136
Really?

35:09.156 --> 35:10.779
2.5 million.

35:10.819 --> 35:11.942
No, I'm kidding.

35:11.962 --> 35:14.067
You mean none of your art pieces ever receded that?

35:15.129 --> 35:15.731
No paper.

35:16.492 --> 35:20.401
Let's see.

35:20.421 --> 35:21.103
No?

35:21.353 --> 35:34.208
Well, the Shakespeare was the... You have to understand, we spend about five or six million dollars a year in art collection.

35:34.248 --> 35:36.631
But we buy a lot of objects.

35:36.651 --> 35:39.855
That's the problem.

35:39.955 --> 35:40.816
Can I use that figure?

35:41.637 --> 35:42.578
I don't want to embarrass you.

35:43.018 --> 35:43.719
I'd like to use it.

35:43.859 --> 35:47.704
I know you would, but I would hate to do that, only because... You know, see, I'm a nice guy.

35:47.744 --> 35:48.885
I shouldn't even have asked you about that.

35:48.905 --> 35:51.208
No, no, the reason is...

35:51.965 --> 35:59.593
Some of the things, only what's going to happen is... See, I've been through a terrible kidnap scare.

35:59.613 --> 36:00.394
I have no idea.

36:00.434 --> 36:08.302
And you've got to understand, it has to be a... I'm giving you all this interview and being straight.

36:08.522 --> 36:09.123
Do you understand?

36:09.143 --> 36:10.984
That's why I didn't have to ask you.

36:11.024 --> 36:13.227
I didn't have to follow up on it, did I?

36:13.367 --> 36:14.428
Did I have to follow up on it?

36:14.448 --> 36:15.209
No, of course not.

36:15.589 --> 36:16.350
This is my point.

36:16.410 --> 36:16.670
Yes.

36:17.571 --> 36:19.373
I gave you the option to...

36:20.753 --> 36:37.856
It's a wonderful, I mean, it's an exceptional, it's an extraordinary figure, but I don't want to... Which last are you talking about?

36:37.876 --> 36:41.040
Let's jump back to something you told me last year.

36:41.425 --> 36:48.837
that when you started going to auctions, that it more or less supplanted a need.

36:49.438 --> 36:51.001
A gambling instinct.

36:51.021 --> 36:52.023
A gambling instinct.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.866
And you talked about the Baccarat tables.

36:54.006 --> 36:54.988
Absolutely.

36:55.709 --> 37:00.396
You never went back to the... Do you still feel like a gambler?

37:00.577 --> 37:02.360
My business is a gambler.

37:03.301 --> 37:07.348
And what I do for a living...

37:08.088 --> 37:34.467
that I buy and sell excess inventory from major manufacturers, divisions of companies, and I pay for these assets with media, advertising media, which I'm in,

37:34.683 --> 37:42.573
And I have to know where to resell this stuff and make a profit.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.858
So that's a gamble.

37:46.999 --> 37:56.892
And my business is trying to buy low and sell high.

37:56.912 --> 37:59.696
All of this is a gamble.

37:59.716 --> 38:00.797
I've been gambling all my life.

38:03.541 --> 38:04.622
When I was single,

38:05.294 --> 38:13.325
And when, first few years of my marriage, I also gambled in Las Vegas.

38:13.345 --> 38:22.837
But when I started to collect, it supplanted that need for gambling, at least in a Las Vegas setting.

38:22.857 --> 38:23.678
Or a casino setting.

38:23.698 --> 38:24.820
Or a casino setting.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.845
But my business, I still gamble.

38:28.865 --> 38:30.067
You still do?

38:30.167 --> 38:31.188
My business, I still gamble.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.272
But my...

38:34.960 --> 38:57.326
Art, book collection, piece of collection, the auction process have also planted that gambling need because the high that is generated at an auction in auction room far exceeds any high I ever got.

38:57.346 --> 39:01.491
A baccarat table, a crap table.

39:01.775 --> 39:04.238
I'm not trying to share it myself.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.079
On a poker table.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.081
Okay.

39:06.101 --> 39:07.743
Question.

39:08.624 --> 39:09.906
Were you a bidding for the Tamerlane?

39:09.926 --> 39:12.589
Did you know that you were bidding against the Reserve?

39:12.749 --> 39:12.950
Yes.

39:15.733 --> 39:17.656
At all times, I knew that.

39:18.717 --> 39:22.282
Even when one dealer, who should remain nameless, came to me and said, I did you a favor.

39:23.223 --> 39:26.207
I stopped at a certain price.

39:26.287 --> 39:27.148
I said to him, bullshit.

39:29.311 --> 39:30.212
I would use that, all right?

39:30.867 --> 39:32.149
I mean, the bullshit is important.

39:32.690 --> 39:34.752
I said the bullshit.

39:34.772 --> 39:35.954
You stuck because you didn't have any more money.

39:36.174 --> 39:40.661
No, because a lot of people have said, you know, Dick Manny was bidding against the Reserve, but I don't think he knew it.

39:41.702 --> 39:43.825
You all knew you could bid safely against the Reserve.

39:45.087 --> 39:47.430
And the moment the Reserve was reached, you all put your hand down.

39:47.470 --> 39:48.792
I didn't.

39:49.008 --> 39:49.889
And that's the difference.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.231
Well, did you know what the reserve was?

39:51.331 --> 39:52.693
Of course.

39:52.713 --> 39:54.155
No one told me, but I assumed what it was.

39:54.455 --> 39:56.077
What did you figure it was?

39:56.097 --> 39:57.079
What did I pay for it?

39:57.219 --> 39:57.840
$198.

39:58.240 --> 39:58.500
What?

39:58.801 --> 40:00.022
Yeah, that was about what the premium was.

40:00.082 --> 40:00.743
So $198 was the premium?

40:00.763 --> 40:02.786
$180 without the premium, right?

40:02.886 --> 40:03.727
Something like that, yeah.

40:04.248 --> 40:05.369
The reserve was $175.

40:05.990 --> 40:06.571
But you knew that.

40:08.153 --> 40:08.253
Yeah.

40:08.273 --> 40:12.999
But then Bill Self, that is for $150 because there was no Dick Manning out there, right?

40:13.019 --> 40:15.342
No Dick Manning out there.

40:15.362 --> 40:18.947
God knows what the next one that I'm putting on the market is going to be.

40:19.062 --> 40:20.864
but you certainly hope it's more than 198.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.827
And I'll be honest with you.

40:23.107 --> 40:24.289
If it isn't, I won't care.

40:25.671 --> 40:27.273
In for a penny, in for a pound.

40:27.293 --> 40:39.088
But I really believe that combined, my collection will more than compensate me for my investment.

40:39.209 --> 40:40.050
Although I don't invest.

40:44.996 --> 40:46.638
More than compensate me for my cost.

40:46.758 --> 40:47.179
OK.

40:47.699 --> 40:51.325
Um, black coffee would be good.

40:51.365 --> 40:54.289
Yeah, cappuccino.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.354
Oh, I have a special.

40:57.995 --> 40:58.456
Okay.

40:58.476 --> 41:00.779
Louise Taper is out to prove that she's not a bimbo.

41:00.839 --> 41:03.824
Fine, okay, I can appreciate that.

41:04.204 --> 41:04.825
She's a gal.

41:04.926 --> 41:05.146
Yes.

41:05.286 --> 41:10.254
She's about 20 years younger than her multi-multi-millionaire husband who married a Taper, marked Taper, married Taper.

41:10.314 --> 41:12.537
She's doing her own thing, doing her own swath.

41:12.998 --> 41:14.280
And, uh,

41:14.362 --> 41:22.294
And she wants to show that she has some intelligence and that she can put together a world-class... Is collecting... Do you collect for yourself?

41:22.334 --> 41:24.617
Do you collect to prove something, to leave a legacy?

41:25.438 --> 41:26.420
Is the name Richard Manning?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.783
You have your name in two rooms at the Metropolitan.

41:28.803 --> 41:29.844
You have your name in Chicago.

41:29.865 --> 41:31.066
You have your name down in Delaware.

41:31.827 --> 41:33.009
It's important, isn't it?

41:33.029 --> 41:33.269
Yes, it is.

41:33.289 --> 41:33.790
To a degree.

41:33.991 --> 41:34.391
Yes, it is.

41:35.012 --> 41:41.922
My wife and I have... have done these things...

41:42.627 --> 41:52.341
Because we felt that it was important to educate not only the public, curators, dealers, collectors.

41:52.361 --> 41:53.763
Do you believe that or there is a kick?

41:53.783 --> 41:54.724
No, no, no kick.

41:55.625 --> 41:57.308
I'll say it a different way.

41:58.510 --> 42:03.356
Look at I just come, Dick Manning, a tremendous kick.

42:03.376 --> 42:06.781
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

42:06.801 --> 42:10.086
The kick is wonderful and the kick is the motivating force.

42:10.488 --> 42:11.870
for doing anything.

42:12.631 --> 42:16.015
But how do you evolve what you want to do?

42:17.397 --> 42:25.428
And evolving what you want to do and who you want to be and what you want to represent is different than the kick.

42:25.468 --> 42:27.611
The kick is the end result of all these things.

42:28.512 --> 42:35.601
And therefore, what we're all about is trying to put together definitive collections that instruct and teach

42:36.239 --> 42:51.962
And the proof of that is when we put the John Henry Belter furniture collection together, we put that together because up until that time, John Henry Belter Victorian furniture was like aspirin.

42:51.982 --> 42:57.250
It was a nomenclature that defined any kind of elaborate Victorian furniture.

42:57.611 --> 42:59.233
But who was Belter?

42:59.293 --> 43:00.976
What actually did he manufacture?

43:01.476 --> 43:02.918
Why was he important?

43:02.938 --> 43:06.043
And we put together a definitive collection to show what he did.

43:06.513 --> 43:08.095
And we're doing the same thing with Jonathan Pryor.

43:10.277 --> 43:16.704
And we're trying to do the same thing in putting together a comprehensive American painting collection.

43:16.884 --> 43:26.874
And I have tried to do this with my American and English literature collection and with the rest of the books that I have put together.

43:26.894 --> 43:30.698
Now, none of it is done without malice or forethought.

43:31.825 --> 43:34.928
And my mouth is a forefooter in the best of all possible ways.

43:34.948 --> 43:40.534
It's done with instruction in mind.

43:40.554 --> 43:48.743
It's done with putting together the kind of a collection that teaches and expands somebody's universe.

43:51.245 --> 43:56.731
It's not done for my aggrandizement or my wife's aggrandizement.

43:56.751 --> 43:57.532
That comes.

43:57.592 --> 43:58.773
That is a priori.

43:58.793 --> 44:01.596
That's there based upon what it is.

44:02.032 --> 44:13.288
The motivation is to put together the best of what we can put together.

44:14.850 --> 44:20.257
Everything else follows from that.

44:20.277 --> 44:31.633
If it means that I have become a major book collector, and that maybe I'll be remembered for my book collection, for what I put together,

44:32.002 --> 44:35.488
I didn't put the collection together to produce that effect.

44:36.350 --> 44:39.555
That effect comes because of what I put together.

44:41.519 --> 44:41.819
Okay.

44:42.220 --> 44:45.906
Did you know that you were selling the books before you sent them over to the Groyer Club or after?

44:45.926 --> 44:55.984
I never knew that I was selling my books when I made the arrangement with the Groyer Club to show my books.

44:56.335 --> 44:57.857
And that's very important.

44:57.877 --> 45:00.861
It is, because some people are a little upset about that.

45:00.941 --> 45:01.361
You know that.

45:01.661 --> 45:02.482
Of course I know that.

45:03.644 --> 45:22.647
And those who know me, and it's very important, Jim Cummins, who helped me select from my collection those books which I exhibited at Rolier, would be the first to tell you that a year before, a year before, and I have to stress that,

45:23.403 --> 45:26.527
is when I made the commitment to Gloria that I would have this exhibit.

45:29.090 --> 45:33.095
And I didn't know until three months before that I was going to sell my book collection.

45:33.996 --> 45:45.090
And I wrestled with this problem and talked about it with Jim and my wife.

45:45.644 --> 45:49.691
And I said... This is going to be misconstrued.

45:50.673 --> 45:50.893
It is.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.155
It is, by the way.

45:52.696 --> 45:53.137
You know that.

45:53.517 --> 45:56.242
Well, I didn't think... I thought I overcame that.

45:56.843 --> 45:58.967
No, I've heard... Recently?

45:59.007 --> 45:59.427
Yeah.

45:59.447 --> 46:00.529
Okay.

46:00.549 --> 46:01.431
You have to understand.

46:01.471 --> 46:07.160
But basically, older New York women, you know what I'm saying?

46:07.721 --> 46:08.142
Yeah.

46:08.577 --> 46:11.720
a few people who thought that maybe you were showcasing the books.

46:11.800 --> 46:12.540
No, no.

46:12.941 --> 46:16.324
Let me tell you, it is very, very important because... Well, it is.

46:16.344 --> 46:18.625
Because this is not... You have to know me.

46:19.186 --> 46:21.568
You have to understand that I'm going to ask you anything that I feel is important.

46:21.628 --> 46:22.449
Please, it's very important.

46:22.689 --> 46:25.451
And I want you to because that clears the air, and it's very important.

46:27.433 --> 46:29.955
Because if we don't answer it, then there will continue to be an innuendo.

46:30.075 --> 46:34.639
Absolutely.

46:34.659 --> 46:38.162
Over a year before the exhibit at Groyer,

46:38.142 --> 46:45.170
Approximately a year before, they asked me to buy one, a selection of my collection.

46:45.290 --> 46:46.212
And I said, they asked you?

46:46.352 --> 46:46.832
They asked me.

46:46.912 --> 46:47.813
Do you remember who asked you?

46:48.534 --> 46:48.795
Yes.

46:48.955 --> 46:51.798
I have a letter to that effect somewhere in my... I forget the gentleman's name.

46:51.858 --> 46:52.739
Bob Nykirk, maybe?

46:52.779 --> 46:53.340
Somebody like that.

46:53.360 --> 46:53.901
He died.

46:54.421 --> 46:55.262
He died, by the way.

46:55.402 --> 46:56.283
Oh, no, I didn't know.

46:56.303 --> 46:57.965
The letter of Bob Nykirk, he was a librarian.

46:58.025 --> 46:59.527
Yes, but I didn't know that he died of AIDS.

46:59.547 --> 47:01.029
I had no idea.

47:01.049 --> 47:02.150
I know everything.

47:02.170 --> 47:03.051
Well, that's okay.

47:03.071 --> 47:03.712
You're supposed to.

47:04.333 --> 47:06.175
That's your job.

47:06.813 --> 47:11.439
It's very important that you understand, and it's physically documented.

47:11.519 --> 47:13.241
I received letters in the mail.

47:13.441 --> 47:18.087
What I needed was to destroy my collection.

47:18.107 --> 47:20.911
And I, of course, said, I think about it.

47:21.011 --> 47:24.235
And I said, yes, very shortly thereafter.

47:24.255 --> 47:26.498
And I said, is it a part of my collection?

47:26.858 --> 47:29.862
And they asked me, would I like anybody to help me?

47:30.803 --> 47:34.508
And they mentioned Jim and Jim Cummins.

47:34.842 --> 47:38.128
and I would select some of the books out of the collection for the exhibit.

47:42.175 --> 47:53.496
It was about six weeks or two months before the exhibit that I made the decision to sell the collection.

47:53.516 --> 47:56.682
That's why it's only about three or four weeks ago that somebody's picked up the collection.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.021
It's very recent.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.043
This is very recent.

48:00.203 --> 48:02.185
This is like three months in the making.

48:02.205 --> 48:04.648
I mean, if you put it all together, it's three or four months.

48:04.668 --> 48:06.710
Who initiated the thing with Sotheby's?

48:06.790 --> 48:07.851
You were Sotheby's.

48:07.871 --> 48:11.595
Well, I initiated it, but let me explain how that worked.

48:12.536 --> 48:15.479
Sotheby's was owed $1.187 million or something like that.

48:15.499 --> 48:17.001
On the Shakespeare.

48:17.101 --> 48:17.822
On the Shakespeare.

48:17.902 --> 48:18.843
And that's how you owed them?

48:18.863 --> 48:20.725
That's how I owed them.

48:20.925 --> 48:25.470
And I owed that to them in...

48:26.159 --> 48:27.341
January of this year.

48:28.363 --> 48:31.929
It was due January 9th of this year.

48:33.973 --> 48:44.651
And I asked them until February if I could pay them, and they said fine.

48:44.671 --> 48:51.002
February came along, and I said to myself, I will

48:51.674 --> 48:56.061
sell some objects to pay the bill rather than send them a check.

48:56.081 --> 48:57.644
And I sent them a list of objects.

48:58.405 --> 49:00.308
This is February, March now we're talking.

49:01.090 --> 49:01.691
Pretty recent.

49:01.771 --> 49:02.352
That's right.

49:03.013 --> 49:16.355
The list of objects were some Tiffany lamps, some arts and crafts furniture, a painting or two or three, and a few children's books out of the collection.

49:16.375 --> 49:17.597
Minor stuff that I really

49:17.982 --> 49:22.207
had no interest in.

49:22.227 --> 49:25.291
That was March already we're talking now.

49:25.311 --> 49:25.912
February March.

49:26.693 --> 49:30.958
And that started to linger while Sotheby's was making decisions as to whether it was worth a million change.

49:31.559 --> 49:36.845
They wanted too many change to cover themselves, because they liked to work on a 50% situation.

49:38.627 --> 49:40.750
And rightly so, and I could appreciate that.

49:41.050 --> 49:52.660
So it really wasn't until March or April, probably April, and I'm not 100% sure of the exact dates I'm talking to you, but probably around then, but I said, you know, let me bite the bullet.

49:54.322 --> 49:55.263
Try to raise some money.

49:55.303 --> 49:56.324
Let me get a little liquid.

49:56.384 --> 49:57.225
It's tight now.

49:59.226 --> 50:01.549
What am I going to sell to really raise some money?

50:02.069 --> 50:03.090
Think about what I owe Southerners.

50:03.110 --> 50:04.191
No, what do you need the money for?

50:04.972 --> 50:06.913
Well, I actually needed to pay Southerners back.

50:06.933 --> 50:08.014
That was the real motivation.

50:08.335 --> 50:09.876
And then I said, why just do that?

50:10.312 --> 50:11.093
Things are tight.

50:11.453 --> 50:13.075
I can only draw so much out of the business.

50:15.238 --> 50:18.262
There are things that I don't want to stop the lifestyle.

50:19.523 --> 50:22.427
But you are by selling the house, but then you said that the house is too big.

50:22.447 --> 50:23.989
We don't know when the house will be sold, though.

50:24.009 --> 50:26.372
It's on the market, but you're dealing with a very expensive house.

50:26.472 --> 50:26.772
Thank you.

50:27.233 --> 50:32.239
You're dealing with a very expensive house, and therefore, you know, in a market like this, you don't know when it's going to be sold.

50:39.628 --> 50:39.728
Okay.

50:40.231 --> 50:41.072
So I said, what the hell?

50:41.112 --> 50:45.678
The collection's worth, I don't know, $7 million.

50:45.698 --> 50:46.780
The book collection?

50:46.800 --> 50:49.263
The book collection.

50:49.523 --> 50:59.036
And I'll put that up at Sotheby's and sell it, because that, if nothing else, that will at least make a market.

50:59.056 --> 51:03.022
Is that your expectation, Seven, off the record, after the sale not to be used?

51:03.042 --> 51:04.323
Let me give you their estimates.

51:04.403 --> 51:09.310
Their estimates are four and three-quarters of

51:09.762 --> 51:10.743
The seven had changed.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.345
Shit, it's got to be better than that.

51:12.365 --> 51:14.067
It is, but they've lowballed it.

51:14.147 --> 51:14.628
You understand?

51:14.688 --> 51:15.849
I mean, the Shakespeare's the two.

51:16.070 --> 51:16.470
Exactly.

51:16.530 --> 51:20.956
It's a lowball collection, but I don't care about that, because I'm of the philosophy.

51:21.136 --> 51:23.699
But still, as book collections go, it's extraordinary.

51:23.719 --> 51:24.560
Yes.

51:24.580 --> 51:30.788
There have only been two $20 million collections, one 16, and the rest are down there.

51:32.410 --> 51:34.812
How can I explain it to you?

51:34.833 --> 51:38.537
I don't care what the estimates are.

51:38.804 --> 51:41.508
Because it's going to reach the value, whatever that is.

51:43.151 --> 51:43.512
You understand?

51:43.532 --> 51:46.116
Estimates have no bearing in an auction.

51:46.536 --> 51:51.464
See, in the book market, better than any market in the world, most of the buyers are dealers.

51:53.428 --> 51:54.610
And they know what things are worth.

51:56.533 --> 51:57.835
Therefore, estimates are bullshit.

51:58.215 --> 51:59.277
They have no meaning.

51:59.763 --> 52:00.965
They're going to pay.

52:01.085 --> 52:02.408
Guys are going to vie.

52:02.448 --> 52:08.940
Guys are going to vie for these objects based on what their clients are willing to pay, too.

52:09.821 --> 52:13.087
There are a few things about speculation today, by the way.

52:13.168 --> 52:14.811
There's always a client, isn't there?

52:14.831 --> 52:16.634
Absolutely.

52:16.654 --> 52:19.459
Do you think that maybe the acquisition was a big kick for you?

52:20.452 --> 52:27.801
like Jerome Curran or, you know, getting it was part of the trick and then maybe you got a little bit bored with it?

52:27.821 --> 52:27.941
No.

52:27.961 --> 52:30.504
Because I asked you once, how do you enjoy these things?

52:30.665 --> 52:32.527
It's not like looking at a picture on the wall.

52:32.547 --> 52:34.069
I mean, that's a reproduction over there.

52:34.129 --> 52:36.472
Let me tell you what it is.

52:37.132 --> 52:41.338
It's a little more complicated and more cerebral than that.

52:43.741 --> 52:49.007
If you talk about a picture or a piece of furniture, for me, the hunt is everything.

52:49.358 --> 52:53.907
Once it's acquired, I do love it.

52:55.330 --> 52:58.136
Do you possess it, though, or do you love it?

52:58.236 --> 53:03.187
I don't possess it, but I continually find more and more joy about it.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.008
I embrace it.

53:04.028 --> 53:06.133
I don't possess it, but I do embrace it.

53:06.153 --> 53:08.177
A lot of the objects I embrace.

53:08.900 --> 53:09.821
Because I think that's fine.

53:10.042 --> 53:11.444
It's a very tactile thing.

53:11.464 --> 53:15.471
I mean, we pick up a snifter and we... Yes, but what I really embrace is my books.

53:16.973 --> 53:20.839
And that's where it's a little more than just a hunt.

53:22.642 --> 53:25.707
It's a little more cerebral also.

53:25.747 --> 53:33.760
When it comes to my books, it's not only the hunting for the fabulous book...

53:34.128 --> 53:54.887
or manuscript but it's the ability to embrace the first expression of this particular piece of literature or this particular piece of literary

53:55.492 --> 53:56.293
Manipulation.

54:00.198 --> 54:03.102
Find it in its absolute pristine condition.

54:03.162 --> 54:04.003
What do I mean by that?

54:05.424 --> 54:06.045
Take fiction.

54:06.926 --> 54:10.311
In the 19th century, double and triple decades were very prominent.

54:11.372 --> 54:15.877
And in England, they were first published in boards.

54:17.259 --> 54:19.542
And I would rather buy an old, dirty,

54:20.652 --> 54:29.181
book in boards than in the finest binding that the original owner put in it.

54:31.103 --> 54:32.305
Can I shut up just for a second?

54:33.226 --> 54:33.926
Yes.

54:34.207 --> 54:43.437
The most recent translation of Don Quixote, which has gotten the greatest accolades in the last five years, was to buy a smallest translation.

54:43.477 --> 54:44.999
Brought out by Ferris Clarkson.

54:45.059 --> 54:49.123
Which I have, and I showed it to her, and I said, you see what we got?

54:49.576 --> 55:11.601
how could you possibly beat him down i said because if i didn't he wouldn't respect me no also am i right or am i wrong of course they think he was giving something away yes more than that more than that it's much rarer than people think because i am hunted i got a back translation for years and let me tell you something

55:11.716 --> 55:15.441
The translation that everybody has is a Jarvis translation.

55:15.481 --> 55:18.466
That's the standard English translation of that period.

55:19.427 --> 55:21.290
By a smaller, you cannot find.

55:21.310 --> 55:22.892
It's scarce.

55:22.932 --> 55:23.593
Nobody knows that.

55:23.933 --> 55:24.975
But I made a study of it.

55:25.015 --> 55:27.338
Two bucks that day.

55:27.358 --> 55:30.943
At least it's worth three.

55:31.024 --> 55:33.307
Eighteen at least.

55:33.387 --> 55:34.809
I beat the son of a bitch now.

55:35.790 --> 55:37.913
I feel guilty about that.

55:37.973 --> 55:38.835
He took it, didn't he?

55:38.955 --> 55:39.816
Of course.

55:39.982 --> 55:42.085
Well, it's part of the adventure.

55:42.105 --> 55:43.446
That's what it's all about.

55:43.486 --> 55:45.209
You do this, but this is fun, isn't it?

55:45.309 --> 55:45.809
Absolutely.

55:45.869 --> 55:46.250
And I do it.

55:46.570 --> 55:48.273
I do it in the same way that you've done it.

55:48.293 --> 55:50.475
You know, I've seen you do it on a different level.

55:50.555 --> 55:51.977
I've seen you at the book fairs.

55:52.178 --> 55:54.480
You're on your hands and knees.

55:54.681 --> 55:55.422
Absolutely.

55:55.442 --> 55:56.583
You get injured on yourself.

55:56.683 --> 55:57.404
Absolutely.

55:57.424 --> 55:58.566
You get sweaty.

55:58.626 --> 55:59.246
I love it.

55:59.667 --> 56:01.289
It's a passion.

56:01.690 --> 56:04.473
You know, and you say, ah, right?

56:04.493 --> 56:04.774
Yes.

56:04.994 --> 56:05.434
Isn't that it?

56:05.454 --> 56:06.456
That's what it's all about.

56:07.277 --> 56:08.318
It's not investment.

56:08.770 --> 56:10.734
It's not anything like that.

56:11.134 --> 56:21.493
It's the love of finding the object, that marvelous book in the original condition that it came off the press.

56:22.315 --> 56:32.854
And I can imagine the author standing there or getting sent to his home the first copy that the printer printed.

56:33.273 --> 56:34.596
I want one of those comments.

56:34.636 --> 56:42.932
You know, you said to me in this interview here that you are not, you personally are not an artistic person.

56:42.952 --> 56:43.994
Well, I have a great look for it.

56:44.715 --> 56:49.304
I mean, that you physically cannot paint a great picture or write a great story.

56:50.306 --> 56:54.133
And so therefore, there's kind of an osmosis thing that maybe by...

56:54.417 --> 57:22.247
possessing yes i'm creating these several things that you're connecting with the creative spirit and this is absolutely and what it is is that by putting i'm hoping that when this collection goes off at auction someone will say that my gosh what this fellow put together

57:24.708 --> 57:35.560
was an assemblies of some wonderful things that have moved and entertained the world.

57:37.121 --> 57:48.133
At that point in time, I can say that, see, I had an appreciation and have an appreciation

57:48.957 --> 58:06.757
of those important things that have gotten a rise out of me, entertained, informed, and made me progress through the world, and hopefully made others progress through the world.

58:06.858 --> 58:08.259
Is a good catalog important to you?

58:08.499 --> 58:08.780
Yes.

58:09.761 --> 58:12.023
For one reason.

58:12.043 --> 58:12.524
This one?

58:13.045 --> 58:13.345
Yes.

58:13.705 --> 58:16.028
And these books.

58:16.177 --> 58:20.162
and manuscripts are given the due that they deserve.

58:20.182 --> 58:23.846
Yeah, but also that they are collected under the Richard Manny collection.

58:23.866 --> 58:25.387
Yes, absolutely.

58:25.407 --> 58:27.390
But they constitute the Richard Manny collection.

58:27.490 --> 58:28.711
Yes.

58:28.851 --> 58:41.065
That I had enough foresight and wherewithal to put together an instructive collection.

58:41.085 --> 58:42.106
Well, you're a young guy.

58:42.447 --> 58:43.968
I figure 54.

58:44.329 --> 58:45.050
Is that about right?

58:45.070 --> 58:45.390
Yes.

58:45.893 --> 58:49.998
Just turned 55.

58:50.059 --> 58:52.101
Okay, so just turned 55.

58:52.121 --> 58:53.243
June 19th.

58:53.303 --> 58:53.764
June 19th.

58:55.286 --> 58:55.946
So what happens?

58:55.966 --> 58:59.271
I mean, is this after book collecting?

58:59.351 --> 58:59.992
Oh, God, no.

59:00.112 --> 59:08.083
I'm haunting the book fairs and the book stores and the antiquarian bookshops and the used bookshops.

59:08.143 --> 59:09.825
No, this is Jerome Kernel over here.

59:10.598 --> 59:16.568
I just have to raise a little money.

59:16.588 --> 59:24.982
I think the collection can raise what I need and not have me feel that I gave the collection a way to do it.

59:25.463 --> 59:28.007
Well, I might have had to give some of the art or antiques a way to do it.

59:29.149 --> 59:32.775
Of course, the market is not good for that, or it is good for books.

59:32.857 --> 59:34.379
And I'll start over again.

59:34.479 --> 59:37.364
I mean, to me, it doesn't mean me.

59:37.564 --> 59:38.786
It doesn't make a difference.

59:39.287 --> 59:40.268
Sure.

59:40.308 --> 59:41.089
Maybe I'm rationalizing.

59:41.810 --> 59:44.294
Because I do have some objects that I may not be able to get again.

59:45.276 --> 59:50.383
After all, Mark Twain's husband that he gave to Libby, his wife, on Christmas.

59:50.483 --> 59:52.707
Well, did you have a choice on what you could give selfies?

59:52.787 --> 59:53.067
Sure.

59:53.167 --> 59:54.249
I could make him want it.

59:54.269 --> 59:56.112
But you gave him everything.

59:56.632 --> 59:57.333
That's my nature.

59:57.354 --> 59:58.375
You have to understand me.

59:58.827 --> 01:00:22.945
If I'm going to cut the heart out of my collection, I might as well give them the collection and at least put a catalog together and offer to the public a value and a total assembly of the things that I put together so that they will come to the auction and feel that their time was lost.
