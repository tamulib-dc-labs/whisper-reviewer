00:02.545 --> 00:05.009
Okay, so we're talking to Edna O'Brien.

00:06.391 --> 00:09.577
This novel, I guess, is inspired by an actual case.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.021
Is that correct?

00:12.041 --> 00:14.365
Not quite, no.

00:14.585 --> 00:23.440
The seed of it was perhaps sparked off in my mind, but it was not inspired by it for a very simple reason.

00:23.791 --> 00:28.997
First of all, the ex-case, I mean, we'll talk about the ex-case right now.

00:29.017 --> 00:43.956
It was a case that the whole world was up in arms about and felt very strongly about, as did I. But it was a girl in the city, and she was pregnant by a friend of her father's.

00:45.017 --> 00:52.566
And she went to England to have an abortion, and the attorney generally recalled the parents' home when she was underage.

00:53.272 --> 01:00.461
And I, of course, read it and was very shocked and sorry for everyone in it.

01:01.823 --> 01:09.853
I couldn't, however, write a book, no one could, what they're sold, just from a newspaper article.

01:10.294 --> 01:15.280
There would have to be an inner momentum for reason.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.136
which would be quite independent.

01:19.377 --> 01:33.773
And because I always write about the country, my story is set in the country, A, and B, it's an incest story, which is a much more, you know, perhaps it's prevalent.

01:34.394 --> 01:40.761
It's not, I didn't do it or wouldn't do it for the sake of the sensation.

01:41.602 --> 01:51.763
I did it because it was something, whatever the word is, resonating there in me for many years to write about.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.701
But I wasn't ready to write about it.

01:53.741 --> 01:56.584
You're not ready to write any book until you write it.

01:56.604 --> 01:57.926
Of course, but incest.

01:58.407 --> 02:06.857
It's amazing how this theme has really... Did you find it frustrating that there are a lot of books dealing in various degrees with incest?

02:06.877 --> 02:17.110
There are, but you know, one writes by oneself in a faraway country, and I'm a little bit aware of it now in different books out.

02:18.288 --> 02:22.314
But that, again, would be something just accidental.

02:23.535 --> 02:24.316
I wrote this book.

02:24.336 --> 02:27.541
It took me three years to write, so I started it three years ago.

02:27.561 --> 02:36.573
There was an interview, I think you did with the New York Times, where you suggested that this might be the second book of the trilogy.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.115
Is that the case?

02:38.135 --> 02:39.477
Yes, that's the case.

02:39.657 --> 02:48.109
One is The House of Spended Isolation, which is about an IRA man on the run in Ireland, in the South.

02:48.865 --> 02:50.948
and he takes a woman hostage.

02:50.968 --> 02:51.629
It's that story.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.611
I don't know if you've read it or not.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.092
I know the book.

02:54.112 --> 02:54.272
Yeah.

02:55.213 --> 03:06.749
And Down by the River is about, well, a girl who has her father's, who's carrying a child, her father's, who's admired you.

03:08.651 --> 03:11.815
Stranded in every sense, psychologically.

03:11.915 --> 03:13.738
I'm just going to put this closer to you.

03:13.758 --> 03:13.858
Okay.

03:13.878 --> 03:14.679
This way, this way.

03:14.699 --> 03:15.480
Oh, yes.

03:15.882 --> 03:16.543
Do they worry?

03:16.823 --> 03:18.465
I think it's buried.

03:18.526 --> 03:19.567
It's just right there.

03:19.587 --> 03:19.907
Sure.

03:20.128 --> 03:21.550
Don't worry about that.

03:21.570 --> 03:39.334
And a third book, which I will be beginning, please God, when I go home after all these journeys, is again prompted, I would think, more than inspired would be the word, by something that happened.

03:40.355 --> 03:43.419
A murder of a land.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.602
People in the country especially

03:46.055 --> 03:59.435
are very possessive of and deeply cling to their bits of land, you know, even if it's only a field as big as that armchair.

04:00.397 --> 04:02.600
And it will be the third book.

04:03.681 --> 04:10.652
It's called Wild Decembers, from a poem of Emily Brontes, Fifteen Wild Decembers.

04:11.734 --> 04:14.678
And there will be my story

04:16.109 --> 04:31.471
of the island in the end of this century, the kind of the pulse of things that happen there, especially in the country, because I write about the country and I'm from the country.

04:32.052 --> 04:37.560
So did you visualize a trilogy?

04:37.979 --> 04:38.921
Did I visualize?

04:38.941 --> 04:42.106
Did you visualize three parts to the story?

04:42.367 --> 04:46.293
Well, I didn't at first because writing is a little bit like sleepwalking.

04:46.674 --> 04:50.341
You don't really know what you're doing except you move.

04:50.381 --> 04:58.114
You move into a strange, both to a strange and unknown path.

04:58.887 --> 05:05.355
I didn't realize it when, four or five years ago, when I sat down to write House of Splendid Isolation.

05:06.356 --> 05:12.404
But it just seemed to me one, in a way, arose out of the other.

05:13.805 --> 05:17.230
You've learned most of your adult life in London, I guess, is that right?

05:17.830 --> 05:19.412
Away from Ireland, certainly.

05:19.432 --> 05:24.519
No, that's a bit of a fallacy, but, you know, people read one thing and then they think that's the truth.

05:25.019 --> 05:27.983
No, I live sometimes in London.

05:28.739 --> 05:30.261
and quite a lot in Ireland.

05:31.343 --> 05:37.312
And I spend a good bit of time, and will be spending more even in New York, because I'm going to teach at NYU.

05:38.834 --> 05:51.192
So I'll be, you know, I've always come to New York, almost always as what's known as a visitor, but I'll be there as a, well, living there next year.

05:51.673 --> 05:58.122
I like, I like actually, it's strange, I like to move around a bit because

05:58.304 --> 06:01.110
For writing you have to have privacy.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.814
Now you can have that anywhere.

06:02.834 --> 06:06.161
You can have it in a city just as much as in the country.

06:07.003 --> 06:11.392
But what it mainly entails is you can't have much of a social life.

06:12.975 --> 06:18.928
It's ironic that writers are supposed to depict the human condition.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.029
and at the same time they have to be helmets.

06:22.809 --> 06:23.410
Very funny.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.991
Kind of a paradox, isn't it?

06:25.011 --> 06:26.413
Yes, yes, yes.

06:27.874 --> 06:31.357
Do you consider yourself an ex-patriot writer then?

06:31.377 --> 06:33.840
No, I don't go in for those words to tell you the truth.

06:34.060 --> 06:46.131
I'm just a writer whose stories are always founded or rooted in my native land.

06:46.651 --> 06:55.682
But you mentioned earlier that on the one hand you're expected to describe the human condition while being expected to withdraw from it.

06:56.063 --> 07:01.810
Do you find that distance does sharpen your perception of that?

07:02.071 --> 07:10.541
Distance always sharpens perception, but distance can be, just as Emily Dickinson would be the first to admit, just going into a room.

07:11.342 --> 07:15.848
You don't have to geographically go a million miles away or to another lassitude.

07:16.300 --> 07:29.833
I think what a writer has to be, or what one becomes, is ever watchful of every place, every sensation, every smell, every sound.

07:30.814 --> 07:37.440
And when you're there in a place, of course, they renew themselves into your mind and into your memory.

07:38.201 --> 07:41.644
To actually write, I wrote some of Down by the River in England.

07:42.485 --> 07:45.868
I wrote some of it in the west of Ireland.

07:46.810 --> 07:50.916
I wrote some of it, well, back and forth.

07:51.077 --> 07:53.300
Is human nature a constant, in your view?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.724
I mean, you're writing about Ireland.

07:56.004 --> 07:58.248
You mean a constant, a universal.

07:58.288 --> 07:59.310
Oh, yes.

07:59.390 --> 07:59.831
Oh, sure.

07:59.951 --> 08:10.928
I mean, the fact... The only reason why I write... Well, yes, I would say that the most...

08:12.443 --> 08:42.417
fundamental reason that I write about Ireland it's the place I know if I set a story in Boston or Vermont or anywhere else it wouldn't have that inner authenticity Hemingway said a very intelligent thing once he said you have to know everything and then you have to just select a few things to put in and it's not just the dialogue and the ear for the rhythms of the speech it's the

08:42.869 --> 08:43.991
It's the landscape.

08:44.612 --> 08:48.719
It's the cultural, psychological ethos.

08:49.540 --> 08:50.361
It's the history.

08:51.162 --> 08:52.384
It's everything.

08:52.404 --> 08:55.530
Now, you were a bandwriter in your homeland at one point.

08:55.550 --> 08:56.651
I was, yes.

08:56.832 --> 08:59.376
I'm fascinated by this whole experience.

08:59.436 --> 09:01.800
I've been interviewed with Andre Brink a couple months ago.

09:01.820 --> 09:05.786
Of course, he was banned in South Africa for years.

09:05.826 --> 09:07.028
Who is this?

09:07.389 --> 09:09.973
Andre Brink, the South African writer.

09:10.595 --> 09:17.522
And he said, you know, to be banned in your own, all of a sudden you're a writer without a reader, in a very definite sense.

09:17.722 --> 09:18.983
Did you ever feel that way?

09:19.003 --> 09:31.976
Wasn't he saying we're a lot... To be banned, he said, you are a writer without a reader, essentially speaking, in your homeland, at least, which was the reason he started to write in English and not just Afrikaans, you know?

09:31.996 --> 09:32.716
Sure.

09:32.736 --> 09:38.442
Well, it has many repercussions, yes.

09:40.160 --> 10:01.172
It makes one, or did to me at the time, feel secretly that I must have done something wrong, that there was some criminality.

10:01.192 --> 10:04.437
Something wrong in a true moral sense, you think?

10:04.717 --> 10:08.563
Well, that there was a criminality in what I did.

10:09.337 --> 10:13.022
And maybe there is a criminality in any writing that's any good.

10:13.082 --> 10:37.133
It doesn't necessarily... When you said you have no readers, the trouble, I think, with present time, and something I deeply regret and lament, is actually that there are not a lot of readers, whether you're banned or unbanned, because the...

10:37.400 --> 10:43.287
the passion and habit of reading, I think, is diminished.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.669
It's reduced greatly.

10:45.089 --> 10:52.519
People go to rock concerts or look at videos or look at television, so that maybe a bit of banning stirs up.

10:55.102 --> 10:55.642
Maybe it's helpful.

10:55.662 --> 10:56.523
Maybe it's helpful.

10:56.543 --> 11:06.816
What I think, though, the deepest cut about it is being misunderstood or punished by your own people.

11:07.471 --> 11:14.077
whom you have written about, not to parody them or humiliate them.

11:14.097 --> 11:14.978
I think that hurts.

11:15.498 --> 11:19.141
That hurts, yes, because it's short-sighted.

11:19.942 --> 11:24.266
I guess you must have an idea of who you're writing for.

11:24.406 --> 11:29.230
Are you writing for the reader in Ireland as well as the reader here?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.972
I never have an idea.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.254
If you had, you'd go off your head.

11:33.294 --> 11:35.976
First of all, every single person.

11:36.462 --> 11:40.455
that might read my book in Ireland would respond to it differently.

11:40.475 --> 11:42.401
It's almost as if it would be a different book.

11:42.882 --> 11:47.637
I write for it, what Kierkegaard called the purity of heart.

11:47.819 --> 11:48.640
No, you could.

11:48.740 --> 11:51.083
I mean, which reader in Ireland would you be thinking of?

11:51.143 --> 11:54.888
A schoolteacher, a doctor, a nurse, a teenager, a hippie?

11:54.948 --> 11:55.609
A Protestant.

11:55.629 --> 11:57.251
A Protestant.

11:57.371 --> 11:58.072
Oh, sure.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.794
No, but I don't think like that.

12:00.155 --> 12:02.938
It would be counterproductive.

12:02.958 --> 12:04.781
Which of them would want to get to?

12:05.682 --> 12:14.473
No, I write about people who I hope have a resonance for readers wherever they be.

12:14.493 --> 12:17.016
Whether they're in Finland or in Buffalo or...

12:18.835 --> 12:28.365
You have been quoted as saying that when you write your fiction in particular, you do tend to gravitate towards the darker side.

12:28.985 --> 12:31.027
Is that an accurate quote?

12:31.588 --> 12:36.373
I think I like dark things, whether they're by men or women.

12:37.534 --> 12:42.819
Most of the greater Shakespeare plays are dark, the tragedies and the histories.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.761
Golgoth is dark.

12:45.302 --> 12:47.644
Yes, I'm dark, but very...

12:48.518 --> 12:50.061
Very glad to be.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.184
How would you define the arc?

12:52.985 --> 13:03.583
Well, to try and depict the deepest recesses of human nature.

13:04.184 --> 13:15.522
The turmoil, the torment, the ambiguity, the fear.

13:15.653 --> 13:19.879
All that would be what one would call deep.

13:20.981 --> 13:24.706
But the superficial writing is like, well, there's plenty of it.

13:24.726 --> 13:26.188
We don't have to dwell on it.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.952
We all know who they are.

13:30.254 --> 13:33.018
I'm sorry, I had an idea there for a question.

13:33.038 --> 13:33.479
Don't worry.

13:33.519 --> 13:34.841
Take your time.

13:34.961 --> 13:37.965
It was a very good question, too.

13:38.006 --> 13:40.429
I'm sure I'll come back.

13:40.797 --> 13:43.159
Doesn't it drive you crazy when you have something you're going through?

13:43.179 --> 13:43.460
I know.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.180
It will come.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.042
If you want to be quiet, then be silent.

13:46.102 --> 13:49.946
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:50.026 --> 13:51.527
You visited Joyce's grave.

13:51.627 --> 13:52.188
I read that.

13:53.129 --> 13:54.870
Do you make literary told images?

13:54.970 --> 13:55.491
I do.

13:55.871 --> 13:57.773
And I guess do you take inspiration?

13:58.274 --> 14:01.397
Now we can really use the word inspiration, I think, properly.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.078
Well, I love Joyce.

14:03.098 --> 14:03.999
He's my master.

14:04.279 --> 14:06.481
He and Faulkner are my two masters.

14:06.501 --> 14:06.742
Faulkner.

14:06.962 --> 14:09.184
They're the ones I read every day of my life.

14:09.805 --> 14:15.873
I happened to be in Zurich and I went to see Joyce's grave and it was quite comic.

14:15.973 --> 14:26.286
It was a bottle of empty Guinness bottle and one dyed green carnation that someone must have brought from a St.

14:26.306 --> 14:31.473
Patrick's Day thing just thrown on the grave and it was very near the zoo.

14:32.695 --> 14:38.462
You could hear the baying of the lions or tigers and I thought Joyce who was very

14:38.780 --> 14:43.366
susceptible to sound, and who dreaded thunder.

14:43.886 --> 14:55.160
He was very frightened of thunder, and of animals, but this constant animal sound, like a kind of mantra.

14:55.180 --> 14:58.003
And there was nobody there at all.

14:58.043 --> 14:59.044
It was a quiet day.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.989
I haven't visited many shrines.

15:03.149 --> 15:08.736
I haven't been to Faulkner's Mississippi.

15:09.155 --> 15:19.628
the inspiration really comes from their work, not from... I was pleased to go to Joyce's grave, and I was... I thought a comic.

15:20.229 --> 15:22.012
That's a wonderful story.

15:22.132 --> 15:29.061
A moment out of Ulysses, Leopold Bloom, you know, the empty Guinness bottle, and the old worn incarnation.

15:29.761 --> 15:35.128
Oh, I know there are so many people like myself to just touch a manuscript.

15:35.148 --> 15:36.130
Ah, that's different.

15:37.071 --> 15:38.773
I saw the handwritten...

15:39.158 --> 15:44.626
manuscript in the National Library in Dublin of Portrait.

15:45.427 --> 16:02.152
And to actually read, and I knew it, I know the text very well, to actually read the words they had for me definitely, whether it was induced or whether it was actually a reality.

16:02.192 --> 16:05.237
They had a palpable effect.

16:05.257 --> 16:08.001
It was the moment in Portrait where

16:08.386 --> 16:15.015
The little boy, Stephen, is in Clongos and he's having a bout of nostalgia.

16:15.817 --> 16:21.264
And he's thinking of his mother at home with her felt slippers and her feet inside the fender.

16:22.005 --> 16:24.910
And it was just that little bit they let me look at for a few minutes.

16:25.531 --> 16:33.582
And I did feel that it carried much more emotion reading it with his handwriting.

16:33.622 --> 16:37.768
He had very pen, spidery handwriting.

16:38.137 --> 16:41.821
than it was the printed book.

16:43.223 --> 16:47.287
Well, the printed book always, always is going to read differently, isn't it?

16:47.328 --> 16:54.135
That's one of these things with books, if they come to us at some point over computer screens, they'll never be the same.

16:54.736 --> 16:56.278
The perception, I think, changes.

16:56.338 --> 16:58.620
It has to have a page, don't you think so?

16:58.660 --> 16:59.521
Yeah, absolutely.

17:00.142 --> 17:02.825
Or it will be a tragedy if they can.

17:03.506 --> 17:06.710
I think I know what I was going to ask you earlier.

17:06.930 --> 17:07.030
Good.

17:07.482 --> 17:33.979
about and of course when i said inspired by that was clearly the wrong word because it was sparked off a bit it was sparked up because what you did was create a novel which we should absolutely point out is a gripping gripping read i mean and and it does it and maybe we could talk a little bit about how a novel does take on a life of its own indeed it does it takes on when you start i always start with the first few lines

17:34.448 --> 17:44.363
In any book and in visits ahead of them the road lay in a long entwined undulation of mud, patched tar and fjords of green.

17:44.383 --> 17:54.880
The grassy surfaces rutted and trampled with the young shoots urgent in the sun, flower and flowering weed in full regalia, a carnival sight.

17:54.900 --> 18:02.852
And I wanted to start to cast, if you like, a kind of spell of...

18:03.052 --> 18:23.234
lushness and beauty, beauty of nature, and yet something within it, a warning of something dark and dangerous.

18:23.814 --> 18:32.704
When it says, they walk away, the father and daughter, and the sound of the traffic growing fainter and fainter at Clackety River beyond.

18:33.072 --> 19:02.455
And in the odd gusts of wind, the undersides of the larches showing up like ballroom skirts of spun silver, the road, their road, silent, trombolant, yet with a speech of its own, speaking back to them, father and child, through trappings of sun and fretted verdure, speaking of the old mutinous, and a fresh cry mounting in the blood,

19:02.637 --> 19:18.081
So that, if I begun with like the fresh cry mounting and the blood scenario, it would be no, it would, you have to build, you have to, in the best sense of the word, enchant the reader.

19:18.702 --> 19:19.423
What was the word again?

19:19.523 --> 19:21.907
Enchant the reader.

19:22.147 --> 19:31.041
So, yes, you make a novel but, and you also hope to create a whole world.

19:31.342 --> 19:35.907
It's not just a girl and her father and this story, it's the whole community.

19:36.588 --> 19:47.781
It's the lies and the hypocrisies and the half, the betrayals and then the friendships, the different things that people have composed of.

19:48.742 --> 19:57.973
You know, it's so strange how people... There's a proverb in the north of England that's very funny.

19:58.173 --> 19:59.415
Northern people say it.

19:59.455 --> 20:00.376
It's even funnier.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.478
I'm about to sneeze.

20:01.799 --> 20:08.569
They say there's not so queer as folk, meaning there's nothing as strange as people.

20:09.190 --> 20:26.256
So you have to create that world of the world of, in this book, Down by the River, the world of judiciary, the judges, the guards, the religious people in that community who are both

20:26.725 --> 20:30.372
religious and also compassionless.

20:30.753 --> 20:38.728
The pro-life, the pro-choice, just the whole caboodle.

20:39.269 --> 20:44.700
You mentioned creating a world and you also mentioned how

20:45.068 --> 20:48.733
how great an admirer you are of the works of Faulkner.

20:49.393 --> 20:49.473
Yes.

20:49.493 --> 20:59.726
And I wonder, this is a multi-layered question, number one, are you creating a world not unlike Yokneputapu County on the one hand... Well, I would like to think I am, yes, yes.

21:00.327 --> 21:08.777
I keep to the same place in Ireland, in my fiction, as I'm talking about.

21:08.797 --> 21:13.523
And it has, somebody reviewing this book, two people actually said,

21:13.790 --> 21:21.319
remarked on it, having some of the fervour and some of the words of Faulkner.

21:22.020 --> 21:37.940
And I think the resemblance would be that the turbulence, the constant of turbulence and rooted.

21:37.980 --> 21:43.307
Faulkner talked about the blood boiling through the land.

21:44.047 --> 21:45.289
What a wonderful image.

21:45.409 --> 21:54.219
I feel the same about the Ireland that I know, which is different to the Ireland that another Irish writer might know or write about.

21:54.279 --> 21:55.521
Very different.

21:55.541 --> 21:55.901
Very.

21:57.523 --> 22:00.927
You've probably read other Irish writers contemporary as well.

22:02.710 --> 22:06.014
I just did an interview with Seamus Dean, as a matter of fact.

22:06.034 --> 22:11.320
Yes, Seamus Dean's book, which people liked very much, Reading in the Dark.

22:11.907 --> 22:12.848
It's very different.

22:12.988 --> 22:18.714
I have no trouble doing two Irish writers in the strength of the two books.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.276
Entirely different books.

22:21.097 --> 22:22.078
You see what I mean?

22:22.278 --> 22:27.964
Completely different universe, even though it's the same country.

22:28.885 --> 22:30.507
Because it's the sense in the end.

22:30.687 --> 22:32.209
It's a good example, actually, isn't it?

22:32.309 --> 22:35.272
Because you are so different.

22:36.033 --> 22:39.957
In the end, it's the sensibility of the writer that selects.

22:40.493 --> 22:48.244
chooses, distorts, metamorphosizes, you name it, that world to bring it to the page.

22:48.565 --> 23:02.265
For instance, in another way, you could put it like this, the Dublin that James Joyce created, both in Dubliners, in portrait, and above all, in Ulysses.

23:03.646 --> 23:04.627
It's not Dublin.

23:05.569 --> 23:17.446
It's Joyce's Dublin and it's more real to me than the Dublin I lived in and worked in and got on and off buses in and fell in love in and wept in and so on.

23:17.947 --> 23:20.731
And that's what literature does.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.254
That's what Faulkner does.

23:22.314 --> 23:23.916
That's what Joyce does.

23:23.936 --> 23:30.666
They totally create a fictional, mythical

23:32.063 --> 23:40.675
totally convincing archetypal world that happens also to bear some relation to a real world.

23:41.075 --> 23:42.177
But you have to have the two.

23:42.918 --> 23:49.227
Unless you have the archetypal reach or breadth, the books are short-lived.

23:49.247 --> 23:53.352
And that is the power of fiction as we approach the end of the century, wouldn't you say?

23:53.513 --> 23:53.913
Absolutely.

23:53.933 --> 23:58.059
Do you have anxiety about the future of the novel?

23:58.079 --> 24:00.282
I mean, if it is able to continue doing...

24:00.582 --> 24:02.625
the kinds of things you just described?

24:03.205 --> 24:03.546
I do.

24:03.646 --> 24:10.835
I think, to tell you the truth, there's an awful lot of clever books, you know.

24:11.836 --> 24:17.924
And a book has to have soul as well as brilliance.

24:18.104 --> 24:21.168
And soul is the feeling.

24:21.188 --> 24:27.957
I'm sure from countries that we know nothing about,

24:29.253 --> 24:42.653
I'm sure there are women and men in parts of Africa that have great stories to tell and great language in which to tell them, but we don't know about them.

24:42.673 --> 24:54.771
I think the kind of Western, slightly... A lot of Western fictions are slightly jaded.

24:55.772 --> 24:56.914
You know, they're...

24:57.181 --> 25:09.138
A writer I do admire, an American writer I admire, who creates or recreates, whatever the word is, a landscape, is Cormac McCarthy.

25:09.158 --> 25:09.839
I admire him.

25:09.859 --> 25:15.507
Beckett said a great thing once about writing vis-a-vis James Joyce.

25:15.527 --> 25:16.889
He said, it's very easy writing.

25:16.909 --> 25:17.590
He was ironic.

25:18.271 --> 25:18.852
Very easy.

25:18.872 --> 25:20.695
He said, it's just making the words do the work.

25:21.816 --> 25:23.138
And Cormac McCarthy...

25:23.776 --> 25:25.157
The words do the work, yes.

25:25.337 --> 25:26.198
I admire his work.

25:26.258 --> 25:32.224
I can see in it some real bravura as well, and I like that.

25:32.564 --> 25:40.091
He really has arrived, hasn't he, after so many years of people's, you know, an overnight success after 20 years of trying.

25:40.431 --> 25:50.661
Yes, well, it's a restless and careless world, and you don't, you know, there's so many books.

25:51.063 --> 25:55.167
Everyone clamoring, every publisher, every, you know, every publishing house.

25:55.948 --> 26:01.975
And also there's that terrible thing called fashion.

26:02.596 --> 26:05.679
Certain kinds of writing more fashionable than others.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.581
You have to stay the course.

26:08.842 --> 26:13.768
The horse that stays the course is the... The one who wins, inevitably.

26:14.549 --> 26:20.395
You quoted also, I hate to throw these quotes at you, but they certainly captured my attention, is that you...

26:20.746 --> 26:23.329
You think like a woman and write like a man.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.413
You were once quoted as having said that.

26:26.914 --> 26:29.197
Is that something you still subscribe to?

26:29.357 --> 26:39.410
I think maybe... Somebody said, you know, why don't you write books more like women writers?

26:39.450 --> 26:43.014
And I said, that's bollocks.

26:43.274 --> 26:45.497
We could kill in the blue.

26:46.298 --> 26:49.302
And just as...

26:49.906 --> 27:09.566
In an opposite sense, Faulkner, whose thought, you know, indeed he is a very convoluted writer, no doubt about it, but some of his tenderness, especially in Light in August and As I Lay Dying.

27:09.606 --> 27:15.933
I'm reading Light in August, by the way, with my 14-year-old daughter, a loud alternating sexist.

27:16.293 --> 27:19.356
But there's a tenderness in it that would be for

27:19.505 --> 27:24.372
in the short-sized brain, thought to be almost a woman's tenderness.

27:24.392 --> 27:28.938
You know, if you read a passage out and said, now, who wrote this, a man or a woman?

27:30.340 --> 27:35.567
There are resonances of Light and August in this new novel, to a degree, aren't there?

27:35.587 --> 27:36.628
Certainly thematic.

27:37.830 --> 27:42.897
Well, the jump cut to this...

27:43.940 --> 27:47.505
I think it's his best book, As I Lay Dying.

27:47.905 --> 27:51.230
I have a first edition of it.

27:51.250 --> 27:51.631
Lina.

27:53.693 --> 27:57.819
You're asking about, you know, the hopes for the future.

27:57.839 --> 28:12.900
I would think one of the, if I had access to the men who run the big television networks, because people love to be read to.

28:13.302 --> 28:16.745
It makes them feel childlike again.

28:17.026 --> 28:20.629
They concentrate when they are read to.

28:20.649 --> 28:39.208
I would for five minutes, no more, five minutes every night before the shock of the news, read a piece of text, a piece of Bible, a piece of Gospel, a piece of Shakespeare, a poem of Emily Dickinson's,

28:39.492 --> 28:43.235
a paragraph of Faulkner, whatever, whoever it be, great stuff.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.298
And I honestly think it would bestow people.

28:47.379 --> 29:05.376
Because when you read a book, just as when you're writing a book, except writing a book takes longer, there's no doubt about it, your mind and your being, whatever part of it, I don't know, I don't know scientifically the words, alters.

29:05.956 --> 29:06.597
You reach.

29:07.167 --> 29:10.771
A deeper part of your own self.

29:12.714 --> 29:14.136
Definitely.

29:14.156 --> 29:18.902
Now, it's a restless world and it's a crowded world.

29:19.502 --> 29:20.544
People are tired.

29:21.385 --> 29:25.430
They're tired from everything, you know.

29:26.191 --> 29:32.078
And to concentrate, to even sit and concentrate and read...

29:32.632 --> 29:33.754
Read two pages.

29:34.274 --> 29:35.356
That's all you need to do.

29:35.516 --> 29:36.918
You don't have to read a whole work.

29:37.899 --> 29:40.223
That takes some real discipline.

29:40.523 --> 29:41.224
Or a sonnet.

29:43.447 --> 29:44.869
Or read a sonnet, at least.

29:45.190 --> 29:45.530
Yes.

29:46.051 --> 29:50.537
Helen Zimler, who teaches at Harvard, right over here, is a great poetry critic.

29:50.557 --> 29:59.370
So she said when she got married, her teacher, her mentor said, now, Helen, I know you're going to be preoccupied with other things, but read a poem every day if it's only a sonnet.

29:59.410 --> 30:00.892
Do you know what I'm saying?

30:00.912 --> 30:00.992
Yes.

30:01.392 --> 30:01.753
No, it's true.

30:01.773 --> 30:02.554
It's true, actually.

30:03.040 --> 30:03.701
It's true.

30:04.802 --> 30:05.343
It's true.

30:05.643 --> 30:12.571
I was in a room the other evening doing a reading and I was sitting in a little inner room and I read a poem.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.196
It was on the wall of Emily Dickens.

30:16.656 --> 30:20.220
God, it was so wonderful, especially before a reading.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.962
It was a poem about hope.

30:22.703 --> 30:23.584
Beautiful poem.

30:24.345 --> 30:29.892
And the idea was that hope was like a feather, you know, that it kind of touched one.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.714
And there was a line in it that said,

30:32.200 --> 30:35.925
Even in the chillest room.

30:36.966 --> 30:37.386
Chillest.

30:37.587 --> 30:38.908
Chillest, yes.

30:38.988 --> 30:40.851
She was fantastic, Emily Dickens.

30:41.772 --> 30:42.913
She was from these parts.

30:42.933 --> 30:44.135
That was she.

30:44.155 --> 30:47.059
Well, you could drive there within about an hour and 20 minutes from here.

30:47.239 --> 30:54.868
And my other great hero from these parts, heroine, hero, whatever we want to call them, is Sylvia Plath.

30:56.150 --> 30:57.131
She knew what she was doing.

30:57.692 --> 30:58.393
Great poet.

30:58.473 --> 30:58.833
She was.

31:00.595 --> 31:01.937
Narrative.

31:02.558 --> 31:10.128
Clearly, your novels are... there's a point to them, but how important is narrative to it?

31:10.148 --> 31:11.069
It seems to me... Very.

31:12.251 --> 31:15.095
Oh, let there be no mistake about its story.

31:15.115 --> 31:24.347
If you think of the great books down the years, that story has to move with a total inevitable...

31:24.580 --> 31:27.384
and ever-gripping momentum.

31:28.505 --> 31:29.326
Bruce does.

31:29.346 --> 31:34.934
I mean, there are long errors and long descriptions, but the pulse of the story moves.

31:35.294 --> 31:40.862
All great books also have a great story, a great sense of a story being told.

31:41.643 --> 31:46.650
Like Lyndon Johnson says, we have to get them in the tent, and then we can preach the sermon.

31:47.230 --> 31:52.357
I think the story gets them in the tent, so to speak.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.659
Yeah, yeah.

31:54.010 --> 31:57.854
Yes, the story is important, very.

31:58.054 --> 31:59.115
And you've done children's books.

31:59.235 --> 32:03.700
I brought one with me that I hope you'll inscribe.

32:04.701 --> 32:07.604
Children as readers, it seems to me, are important to you.

32:09.046 --> 32:15.212
Oh, yes, because they're the most—Prisoners and Children would be the two most devoted readers.

32:15.232 --> 32:18.195
Captain audience.

32:18.496 --> 32:19.317
That's funny.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.845
You have to leave a quarter of it, is that what you're saying?

32:25.025 --> 32:25.786
Yeah, I will.

32:26.227 --> 32:28.710
Because we've only got five minutes, would you inscribe a couple of books?

32:28.730 --> 32:29.652
Sure, sure.

32:29.732 --> 32:32.415
Do you want to ask a few more and then I'll do the book?

32:32.936 --> 32:33.637
Okay.

32:34.498 --> 32:37.302
This has been a very good interview, by the way.

32:37.583 --> 32:40.627
I think this is related to an earlier question.

32:41.108 --> 32:43.090
Do you see yourself creating a corpus?

32:44.132 --> 32:47.136
Is every book that you write part of a

32:47.757 --> 32:56.028
Well, it would be the way one's arms are part of one's body, one's head.

32:56.048 --> 32:57.851
Maybe you're not asking the question correctly.

32:57.871 --> 33:08.565
I did an interview once with Nadine Gordimer, who said that she felt that every book that she writes is kind of like a different view of the same stature.

33:08.626 --> 33:16.296
She said it's kind of like walking into a room and there's a piece of sculpture, and you might walk and look at it from this angle or from that angle.

33:16.546 --> 33:32.900
since you kind of compared all of the books that she writes to different views of the same... I don't know if you subscribe to that or not, but I guess is everything part of one... Everything is a continuum.

33:33.301 --> 33:42.229
What happens is the books, in my own case, become more labyrinthine.

33:42.809 --> 33:45.912
You're in the same universe

33:46.567 --> 33:59.143
But you're breaking through different borders of the psyche, of the inner self, and therefore of the stories you're giving.

34:01.446 --> 34:08.074
Each book is like a stepping stone to the next book.

34:09.376 --> 34:12.620
And it happens, it's a very unconscious process.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.582
All writing is unconscious.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.588
If you were to plan it, it wouldn't be any good at all.

34:18.649 --> 34:27.418
As regards the looking at the same thing, I would put it slightly different.

34:28.599 --> 34:36.507
You look deeper into things with each book because you have to dredge deeper.

34:37.248 --> 34:39.490
The first book is always the easiest.

34:39.791 --> 34:43.995
It's waiting in the wings of your mind to be written.

34:44.296 --> 34:53.085
if you happen to be a writer, the eighth or ninth or tenth or fifteenth book, because the landscape is the same.

34:54.486 --> 35:09.340
The people have maybe multiplied, but some of their passions and their obsessions are rooted in that same place.

35:09.380 --> 35:12.183
So you can't tell the same old story.

35:13.124 --> 35:14.185
You have to give it

35:14.553 --> 35:16.296
a new dynamic.

35:18.479 --> 35:21.424
But they're cousins, you know, it's a tribe.

35:21.524 --> 35:25.270
A tribe of books, I think I would call it.

35:25.370 --> 35:37.509
Henry James, when he brought out the New York edition of his books, and he was supposed to just write prefaces to all of them, he went back and started tinkering with the books themselves, which was kind of funny.

35:38.070 --> 35:41.455
You know, have you ever been tempted, if you had the opportunity,

35:41.789 --> 35:49.681
to go back and rewrite history, so to speak, or do you think all of your books speak for who you were at that particular point when you develop it as a writer?

35:49.701 --> 35:50.622
Most of them do.

35:50.662 --> 36:03.501
There is one book that I did not realize as fully or as organically as I feel I have realized down by the river.

36:03.541 --> 36:05.524
Our house is playing in isolation.

36:05.544 --> 36:07.447
It was called The High Road.

36:07.988 --> 36:08.809
It didn't...

36:09.633 --> 36:19.012
It didn't have its cathartic emotional effect.

36:20.395 --> 36:23.982
So if you're writing it today, you'd write it a lot differently, wouldn't you?

36:24.002 --> 36:26.848
Well, I'd certainly improve it, yes.

36:27.284 --> 36:27.705
I would.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.187
Are you ever tempted to go back?

36:29.267 --> 36:30.168
No, no.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.069
I have too much to do.

36:31.329 --> 36:36.596
But you also believe that completed work is completed work, I guess.

36:36.616 --> 36:38.299
It would somehow be impossible.

36:38.379 --> 36:38.900
So what?

36:39.120 --> 36:41.563
Everyone is allowed one or two mistakes.

36:41.663 --> 36:42.785
And that's in your view.

36:42.845 --> 36:46.870
But I mean, some people might think it's wonderful.

36:46.890 --> 36:47.771
Yes, it's so funny.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.595
The other day someone came up to me and said, I love this book.

36:50.615 --> 36:51.516
It makes me cry.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.559
I said, they all make you cry.

36:53.659 --> 36:54.220
So...

36:54.200 --> 36:55.907
You could pick a better one.

36:55.927 --> 36:56.228
Yeah.

36:56.951 --> 37:00.466
I think we've got a lot of stuff here, believe it or not.

37:00.486 --> 37:00.847
You sure?

37:00.928 --> 37:01.169
Yeah.

37:01.189 --> 37:03.940
I'd love to just take the opportunity.
