WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:04.836
We're running, talking to John Irving.

00:04.976 --> 00:06.418
I'll just forget that it's there.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.663
Well, thank you, Mr. Irving, for seeing me today.

00:09.683 --> 00:15.772
I guess I'd like to say I enjoyed this book enormously.

00:16.092 --> 00:17.274
Thank you.

00:17.714 --> 00:27.689
And I like a John Irving novel, which is really expansive and really allows a lot of room to move at your pace.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.354
Tell me how you view this book in the

00:31.604 --> 01:01.425
I think it's a book that will please people who have liked my books before or who have found elements to like in my books before because I think it's a novel that

01:01.810 --> 01:03.933
has more of those elements.

01:07.076 --> 01:10.640
It's a bigger plot, a complicated plot.

01:11.542 --> 01:17.048
I don't think someone who reads me with any pleasure can be a reader who doesn't like plot.

01:19.111 --> 01:31.345
And the degree to which you can anticipate what happens in the story, but that there are also surprises,

01:32.776 --> 01:40.746
I'm pleased with that, I guess what I call the seamlessness of the story.

01:41.968 --> 01:49.437
I'm happy with the structure of it, and I think people who like me for any reason will like this book a lot.

01:50.478 --> 01:58.969
On the other hand, I think those readers who are not John Irving readers, those readers who

01:59.320 --> 02:19.023
whom I've irritated for one reason or another in the past, and who don't find the convolutions and labyrinths of my storytelling enjoyable, who find it tedious and manipulative and difficult.

02:19.503 --> 02:28.213
I think that for people who have been put off by my books in the past, this one will be more off-putting than

02:29.358 --> 02:44.298
or I should say maybe even more off-putting, because it's, as a manuscript, 200 pages longer than any other manuscript of mine.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.422
You mentioned 1,000 plus pages.

02:47.583 --> 02:54.572
It was 1,100 pages, and that's, you know, both a peripheral meaning and the cider house rules were

02:55.210 --> 02:56.311
almost a thousand.

02:56.752 --> 02:59.055
They were sort of 800, 900 page manuscripts.

02:59.395 --> 03:23.547
This one is appreciably that much longer, but I feel though that the foreignness of the material, the Indian material in this novel, it's a little hard to judge that in relation to the other seven novels because it seems to me that

03:25.147 --> 03:31.814
That might be something that my readers would enjoy because it's different, or different for me.

03:33.495 --> 03:36.518
It's not the New England setting that they've been used to.

03:37.760 --> 03:43.565
It's an Indian-born doctor living in Canada, and almost the entire novel is set in India.

03:44.346 --> 03:45.728
And he speaks English.

03:45.748 --> 03:54.276
It's like James Joyce writing, you know, an Irish rewriting Ulysses in English, publishing it in Paris.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.960
It's all of these things.

03:56.560 --> 03:56.720
Yes.

03:56.740 --> 04:10.674
I think that that foreignness... I mean, there may simply be readers who find India and Dr. Darawalla and his concerns in general simply just too foreign for them.

04:10.795 --> 04:14.879
I'm certainly prepared for that reaction as well.

04:15.199 --> 04:20.084
Why is foreignness so important for you to stress in this book?

04:20.104 --> 04:21.786
And you stress it a number of times.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.128
Well, I think that was...

04:24.412 --> 04:27.036
That was my entrance to the character.

04:27.577 --> 04:36.971
In other words, I always begin a story, I begin thinking of a story at the ending, and I need to work my way back to where it begins.

04:37.071 --> 04:44.382
In other words, if there is such a thing as a vision, and I must say I'm almost too practical to have visions.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.687
I don't have visions, really.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.212
But in this case,

04:52.154 --> 04:57.600
Before Owen Meany was published, in fact, I think I was still proofreading the manuscript.

04:58.741 --> 05:12.475
One winter night in Toronto, my wife and I were returning to our apartment after dinner, and it wasn't a street corner like Dr. Darawalla is standing on at the end of the novel.

05:12.615 --> 05:16.019
It was more downtown than that, traffic lights, city lights.

05:16.559 --> 05:20.203
But it was around Christmas time, snow falling.

05:21.128 --> 05:23.431
And our cab was stopped at a traffic light.

05:24.353 --> 05:29.240
And out the window I saw a man, a pedestrian, also waiting for the light to change.

05:29.280 --> 05:35.750
And he looked a lot as I described Dr. Darawalla.

05:36.211 --> 05:41.959
I mean, he may have been Indian, he may have been Middle Eastern.

05:42.981 --> 05:47.608
In that light, I couldn't tell.

05:49.462 --> 05:57.531
It was clear to me, though, that he was what newspapers call an immigrant of color, a visible minority.

05:58.331 --> 06:00.354
He was no fifth-generation Canadian.

06:00.554 --> 06:00.894
For sure.

06:01.315 --> 06:12.066
And I noted how elegant he looked, how well-dressed, dignified, composed.

06:12.086 --> 06:17.832
I would guess he was ten years older than me, early 60s.

06:18.790 --> 06:36.816
And I was struck by how the life he came from, the past, wherever his birthplace was, it just struck me that that must strike him as a foreign country now.

06:38.178 --> 06:44.848
And at the same time, it struck me that he could never feel entirely assimilated

06:45.655 --> 06:59.494
where he was, and that the richness of where he came from was a very big part of his life, which probably had little means for expression in the country he lived.

06:59.915 --> 07:01.357
I was just presuming these things.

07:02.358 --> 07:03.340
You're a storyteller.

07:03.360 --> 07:15.156
I was just ruminating or thinking about it, and he looked a little not sad, not lonely, just melancholic, which I would suppose would describe the tone of that ending.

07:15.524 --> 07:22.014
Do you do this, by the way, do you create narratives when you see... I imagine how they got there.

07:22.375 --> 07:34.695
I was looking at this man and I was thinking, I just took a look at this guy and I thought, I'll never know anything about him, but what an interesting life he's probably had that brought him here.

07:34.735 --> 07:35.416
You know what I mean?

07:35.636 --> 07:42.848
Absolutely, but certainly the title of the whole concept of the book does also become very clear in that concluding scene as well.

07:43.199 --> 07:45.542
Did this come to you in a flash?

07:45.562 --> 07:46.923
Yeah, it did, really.

07:47.143 --> 07:49.306
I mean, I just thought... The circus came to you?

07:49.426 --> 07:50.287
Not the circus.

07:50.347 --> 07:53.290
That worked into my plans later.

07:53.530 --> 07:54.371
Not the circus.

07:55.532 --> 07:57.194
That as well becomes very clear.

07:57.214 --> 07:57.515
Yes.

07:58.356 --> 08:11.670
I thought of this, though, that image of his foreignness and my presumption that he was or felt himself to be as much of a foreigner in his country of birth

08:12.308 --> 08:18.518
as he must feel or often feel in his adopted country.

08:19.179 --> 08:26.330
And I talked about this to some of my Indian friends in Toronto at first and then in London.

08:26.630 --> 08:31.317
I talked about this guy and I said that's the end of a novel.

08:31.438 --> 08:41.353
I don't know how to get to the beginning but the end of the novel is how we feel about this man when we see him by himself

08:41.992 --> 08:43.213
in a foreign country.

08:43.293 --> 08:44.054
Have you worked back?

08:44.475 --> 08:45.936
And I worked sort of... Really?

08:45.956 --> 08:50.702
Yeah, so I... In the structuring, yeah.

08:50.722 --> 08:51.543
And then I go back.

08:51.663 --> 08:52.143
I go back.

08:52.204 --> 08:55.928
I've done this ever since The World According to Garp.

08:56.028 --> 09:02.796
Every novel, Garp included, begins with a sense of an aftermath.

09:03.817 --> 09:11.205
I've not called that by name an epilogue in every case.

09:11.590 --> 09:17.238
This is the first time I've titled it epilogue since Garp.

09:17.378 --> 09:18.860
Garp had an epilogue, too.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.943
It really didn't be an epilogue, either.

09:21.904 --> 09:24.949
I mean, it's... No.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.250
It does bring the thing into focus.

09:26.391 --> 09:26.851
It's true.

09:26.971 --> 09:28.974
It's a kind of telescoping away.

09:29.114 --> 09:30.657
You know, it's two or three years later.

09:30.677 --> 09:34.202
It's that sense of moving away from the action and seeing where he stands.

09:34.682 --> 09:37.446
So that, in a sense, you see, I began...

09:37.949 --> 09:43.316
When I first started thinking about this book, I thought, I'm never going to go to India, and if I did go to India, what could I learn?

09:43.376 --> 09:45.619
I could be there for three years, and I'd never know anything.

09:45.639 --> 09:48.003
Had you not been to India when this thing happened?

09:48.643 --> 09:51.547
So then the occasion came, the opportunity came.

09:51.567 --> 09:55.473
The opportunity only came once I had sort of really made up the story.

09:55.573 --> 10:02.762
In other words, I would not have gone until I had the story, because until I had the story, I didn't know what I needed to know.

10:03.303 --> 10:07.669
Until I'd worked my way through, I'd looked at a lot of films,

10:08.459 --> 10:13.045
Every other film in the Bombay cinema is about twins separated at birth.

10:13.085 --> 10:14.647
And so I thought, well, that would be fun.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.330
And how would the doctor know these twins?

10:18.532 --> 10:27.523
And where would one of them, what would possibly bring the one who wasn't left in India, what could possibly bring him to India?

10:28.204 --> 10:29.285
Who goes to India?

10:29.465 --> 10:30.947
Well, the deserts go to India.

10:31.307 --> 10:32.068
And what do they do?

10:32.169 --> 10:33.250
Well, you see what I mean?

10:33.730 --> 10:36.234
And I just sort of did that sort of thing.

10:37.155 --> 10:38.196
The circus.

10:38.986 --> 10:43.693
was almost the last piece of the puzzle because I had my doctor.

10:44.174 --> 10:46.237
I knew his relationship to the twins.

10:46.538 --> 10:47.619
I knew what the twins did.

10:47.639 --> 11:03.383
I knew he wrote these terrible Hindi movies that he didn't even put his name to and had created this sort of monster character, a kind of Indian James Bond who just irritated the hell out of everyone.

11:04.225 --> 11:07.710
And I saw how that related to the murders.

11:08.062 --> 11:14.890
and that the murders he saw 20 years ago were unknown to him, the beginning of a series of serial slayings.

11:15.751 --> 11:26.584
And the police inspector and Nancy, all these people kind of made a cast, and I... This moves from that, this all begins from that... Seeing the fellow on the corner, yeah.

11:26.604 --> 11:36.516
And then... Then I began to hear, repeatedly, from my old friends, Mary Ellen Mark and Martin Bell, who I...

11:36.833 --> 11:39.336
mentioned, of course, in the opening notes.

11:39.636 --> 11:46.524
And they'd been spending years in India trying to get a documentary off the ground about the children in the circuses.

11:47.765 --> 11:50.228
And I thought, well, what does this have to do with me or my story?

11:50.268 --> 11:53.051
Because we'd never had a working relationship before.

11:53.071 --> 11:59.719
I mean, Mary Ellen had taken a couple of hook jacket photographs from me, and I liked Martin's movies.

12:00.323 --> 12:01.104
We were just friends.

12:01.504 --> 12:04.267
And they had a totally different line of work.

12:04.327 --> 12:05.608
I had my work, they had theirs.

12:06.129 --> 12:08.871
But we got together when we could, just because we were friends.

12:08.971 --> 12:11.414
And they knew I was thinking about this.

12:11.594 --> 12:13.275
I kept calling it my immigrant novel.

12:13.776 --> 12:22.164
And for the most part, I kept imagining it as a novel that would be, for the most part, set in North America, in Toronto.

12:23.025 --> 12:28.390
And very little of it would take part in India, because it would be about this guy's life here.

12:29.855 --> 12:38.003
That's why I didn't have enough of the connection or enough of the means or reason to sort of go to India.

12:38.824 --> 12:59.524
And then Martin and Mary Ellen said to me, well, we keep hearing from the people that are trying to make this movie that there's no money to be had for documentaries, but if we were to make a feature, a fiction film, we could get the money to do it.

13:00.145 --> 13:05.452
And, uh, what would you think about, um, they knew I'd just finished the screenplay for the Cider House Rules.

13:06.774 --> 13:08.897
And so they knew I'd just finished the screenplay.

13:09.718 --> 13:17.248
And I was complaining about the difficulty of writing a screenplay from a big novel and just shrinking it down.

13:18.009 --> 13:25.720
And Martin said, sort of half-joking, really, um, well, why don't you write a screenplay first and then write the novel?

13:26.661 --> 13:27.402
And, um,

13:28.327 --> 13:31.671
And he said, in fact, why don't you write the screenplay for us?

13:31.731 --> 13:33.913
Because we need to get some money to make this movie.

13:34.774 --> 13:39.499
And I had seen Mary Ellen's photographs of children in these circuses for years.

13:40.981 --> 13:41.501
The dwarfs.

13:42.603 --> 13:43.544
All of them, yeah.

13:43.564 --> 13:45.205
I'd seen those photographs for years.

13:45.306 --> 13:53.895
And they were always very striking to me, as her photographs are.

13:54.652 --> 14:01.879
And I've also seen her photographs of the prostitutes on Falkland Road in Bombay, a book that was published years ago.

14:01.899 --> 14:05.363
The description of those eunuchs.

14:05.383 --> 14:06.504
Oh, yeah.

14:06.524 --> 14:07.545
How they become recognized.

14:07.565 --> 14:08.125
They're real.

14:08.746 --> 14:09.306
That's real.

14:10.508 --> 14:14.431
And so I... And they're higher priced than the conventional ones.

14:14.451 --> 14:15.352
Yes.

14:15.372 --> 14:15.613
Yes.

14:15.633 --> 14:16.193
That's true.

14:17.074 --> 14:20.197
Anyway... I'm sorry to interrupt.

14:20.217 --> 14:23.140
One thing led to another, and they said,

14:23.879 --> 14:32.927
well, why don't you come with us and we'll go around to these circuses and think us up a story about what can happen to the kids in the circus.

14:33.868 --> 14:40.674
And then I thought Dr. Darawalla could be writing that story about what happens to children in the circus.

14:40.894 --> 14:45.418
But the difference is that what he writes is what he wishes happened.

14:46.239 --> 14:49.001
And what happens to them is what happens to them.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.844
And the movie is what Dr. Darawalla wishes had happened.

14:52.735 --> 15:06.128
And so then I began to see a connection to Martin and Mary Ellen's children in the circus and with my character, who is writing these Inspector Dara movies.

15:06.148 --> 15:07.169
You see what I mean?

15:07.469 --> 15:08.350
That was the connection.

15:09.591 --> 15:11.393
The film is the same title, right?

15:11.413 --> 15:12.114
It is the same title.

15:12.134 --> 15:13.155
But it's not the same story.

15:13.475 --> 15:14.136
No.

15:14.876 --> 15:20.802
So those who see some of the circus movie should not expect to see a...

15:21.018 --> 15:21.899
No.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.787
If there's a movie, it's way too soon to even know.

15:26.827 --> 15:28.910
No one should hold their breath for the movie.

15:29.711 --> 15:36.462
But if there is a movie, it will resemble Dr. Darawalla's screenplay.

15:37.544 --> 15:44.454
It is very closely, it's very close to that, not to this story.

15:44.474 --> 15:49.422
All right, so you explained how the circus element came in.

15:49.739 --> 15:53.866
it transcends with you to metaphorical status.

15:53.886 --> 16:06.188
Well, I think that came about in part because of how, although I was there in India for less than a month, for half of that time I was with the circus, traveling with the circus.

16:06.448 --> 16:14.683
And, you know, a month isn't a very long period of time, but

16:17.819 --> 16:24.747
Two weeks in an Indian circus is a long time.

16:25.167 --> 16:29.012
There is an incredible completeness to their life.

16:31.074 --> 16:47.573
The rigor of it, the discipline of it, the orderliness of it, three times a day, an act, every day, seven days a week, all year, is...

16:47.772 --> 16:50.014
is just incredible.

16:51.936 --> 17:06.310
The sense that, and also the sense that you have, which was a sense I wanted Dr. Darawalla to feel everywhere he goes in his country of birth, that the circus is an oasis.

17:06.871 --> 17:16.480
It's a safe haven for the people who are fortunate enough to be sort of taken in by it.

17:17.624 --> 17:26.453
It's better than the chaos and the danger out there, all around the surface.

17:27.294 --> 17:34.701
And I felt very much taken in by them and adopted by them.

17:34.862 --> 17:39.887
And people were, you know, it was a world unto itself.

17:40.107 --> 17:47.074
And I felt strangely more comfortable in it

17:48.387 --> 17:57.525
Because it was a world with rules and order, and it had a daily enterprise about it.

17:59.990 --> 18:10.210
You got up at the same time, there were exercises to do, there were chores to do, there was cooking to be done, there was sewing to be done, there was practicing new acts.

18:10.443 --> 18:40.146
and then all of that had to be put aside and there was a big meal to eat and a long nap to have and then starts the cycle of one performance after another and another big meal at about midnight after the last performance is over and then to bed and it's just it's a remarkable world it's sort of a world of its own and and it contrasts greatly to

18:41.628 --> 18:52.503
the life in the streets of Bombay, the life in the Red Light District, the comings and goings at a club like the Duckworth Club, at a private club.

18:54.345 --> 19:03.998
Anyone who knows Bombay will recognize the Duckworth Club as a place called the Willingdon Club.

19:04.459 --> 19:11.128
I would have called it the Willingdon Club and kept it the real club, except that

19:12.053 --> 19:16.317
the real Lady Willingdon... Did she expose her to crisis?

19:16.337 --> 19:16.397
No.

19:16.858 --> 19:19.821
The real Lady Willingdon was a kleptomania.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.904
And I didn't like that as well.

19:22.924 --> 19:30.972
I thought that that was kind of a pathetic vice, whereas exhibitionism is an interesting vice.

19:31.593 --> 19:36.998
And I wanted the lady of the founders

19:37.518 --> 20:03.593
wife to be more interesting than a kleptomaniac and so I couldn't very well make Lady Willingdon into an exhibitionist because she was a kleptomaniac and the Willingdon family would have sued me or something and so I thought so I thought call her Duckworth and let her expose herself and there are a few other

20:04.923 --> 20:05.304
St.

20:05.324 --> 20:08.809
Ignatius is in real life in Bombay.

20:08.889 --> 20:16.020
It's in exactly the part of town where I say it is, but in real life it's St.

20:16.040 --> 20:20.147
Mary's, and I wanted the Ignatius because of the Jesuitical connection.

20:20.668 --> 20:32.466
I think, having never been to India, and I've been to Thailand, but there was a certain, you described the smell of these cities.

20:33.593 --> 20:40.404
Having never been there, I really feel that you've given me a sense of what this city is.

20:40.544 --> 20:42.627
It uses open service and all these things.

20:42.647 --> 20:43.248
Absolutely.

20:43.268 --> 20:46.033
Every city I've ever come from has a small one.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.315
I haven't been there in 25 years.

20:47.335 --> 20:47.575
Yes.

20:48.256 --> 20:50.900
I'd go back and I'd have to flash back, I'm sure.

20:51.381 --> 20:51.922
Absolutely.

20:52.783 --> 20:54.686
No, it's indelible.

20:55.127 --> 20:59.975
These are the kinds of things that you have to go and spend time there to get this kind of ambiance.

20:59.995 --> 21:00.496
Yeah, you do.

21:01.116 --> 21:01.457
You do.

21:01.910 --> 21:08.656
You could have probably written a novel without having spent this time in India, but I don't think you would have the richness.

21:08.876 --> 21:13.581
I don't think you can't get the atmosphere of the detail.

21:14.161 --> 21:29.115
But almost more important than being there, or more important than how long I was there or how little I was there, was also having these expert readers having

21:30.513 --> 21:37.546
not just Indian friends read the book, but they weren't just friends, they were also experts in certain areas.

21:39.350 --> 21:50.851
Three doctors read the book, one of them Indian, particularly a doctor of infectious medicine, an AIDS doctor.

21:50.871 --> 21:54.057
In fact, one of my readers for this book is the man who's

21:55.032 --> 22:02.883
whose own book was on the front page of the Times Book Review, or is on the front page of the Times Book Review this coming Sunday, Abraham Verghese.

22:05.467 --> 22:06.548
Let's just see.

22:06.568 --> 22:07.890
Let me just grab that.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.615
I just want to check the tape.

22:12.817 --> 22:15.240
That's Dr. Verghese there.

22:15.501 --> 22:20.327
It's a coincidence that we have our books coming out at sort of the same time.

22:20.367 --> 22:23.672
But what I mean is that in the case of all of my friends,

22:24.479 --> 22:31.388
and readers, they knew an area of this book.

22:31.408 --> 22:35.573
It wasn't just that they were friends of mine, it's that they were experts in certain areas.

22:36.334 --> 22:52.174
Abraham, in all the medical detail, Dianita Singh, who's mentioned in those authors' notes, knows more about the prostitute community, the transsexual community, the Hedra community, than probably any other journalist.

22:52.593 --> 22:53.214
in India.

22:53.234 --> 22:58.438
She's a journalist who's based in New Delhi, but she's done a lot of work with the prostitute community in Bombay.

22:59.519 --> 23:15.853
Farooq Chothia, who lives in Bombay and who was so important because of what he knows about Bombay and about the circuses, that I named Dr. Dharawala after him and gave Dr. Dharawala his first name.

23:16.354 --> 23:21.098
So that as important as my being in India,

23:21.382 --> 23:48.756
more important is two three years down the road when when there's a 1200 page first draft and then six months later when there's an 1100 page second draft these people had to read it and and they had to say no no no you've got this wrong it's not there it's here and and and they were very important to this and i i think i felt

23:50.238 --> 23:58.245
I would have felt intimidated to be that dependent on so many expert readers if I had not already had that experience.

24:00.267 --> 24:14.940
And I had it with the Cider House Rules because I'm not an obstetrician or a gynecologist and what could I know about an orphanage and an orphanage hospital 10 years or 12 years before I was born?

24:15.721 --> 24:18.844
And the answer was I had a lot of people at

24:19.212 --> 24:29.126
Yale Medical School and at the Yale Medical Historical Library, who were checking up on me, who were reading over my shoulder.

24:29.727 --> 24:46.130
And that experience was so positive, and I felt that it worked so well that I wasn't more than moderately intimidated by the prospect of this.

24:46.390 --> 24:48.493
Now, Garth was published in 78.

24:48.980 --> 25:02.275
I guess, 16 years, who, I mean, AIDS was a totally unknowable thought that it would become such a, I mean, it's a metaphor for you.

25:02.295 --> 25:02.515
Yeah, yeah.

25:02.535 --> 25:09.983
And again, going back to the streetcar in Toronto, I mean, at what point does this enter the, into this complex situation?

25:10.003 --> 25:18.092
Well, it seems to me that you can't even superficially touch upon the prostitute community today without bringing that picture into question.

25:19.034 --> 25:47.404
and the principal question today if you're in the business as Vinod is in the business of rescuing child prostitutes or would be child prostitutes is are they HIV positive and in India that is going to become I think a more terrifying episode than what we've seen heretofore in Africa the profile of

25:48.278 --> 25:55.367
the way AIDS is communicated in India is a heterosexual profile.

25:56.027 --> 26:14.250
There are parts of Asia and Africa where the contact is strictly heterosexual and is spreading like gonorrhea.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.914
And it's a different profile in North America.

26:18.282 --> 26:33.863
where it is very much not limited to, but in the main, to be found in the homosexual community and the drug user community.

26:34.324 --> 26:37.428
That's not the profile of the world, though.

26:38.029 --> 26:48.103
So you have to... You know, there were a number of areas that led me to that, as surely as...

26:48.725 --> 27:08.556
When I was thinking about my orphanage physician and the orphans in the cider house rules, I was inevitably led to abortion because you can't consider a hospital at an orphanage without considering what do you do about that.

27:10.018 --> 27:11.520
That's just historically true.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.947
That was a factor.

27:16.400 --> 27:26.936
There are no orphanages as there were of the kind I was writing about in the Cider House Rules after abortion becomes a legal operation.

27:27.597 --> 27:30.081
After 1973, they're gone.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.426
And so that novel had to be historical.

27:34.167 --> 27:43.521
And in the case of this, I mean, how can you... I couldn't raise the issue of the biology of homosexuality

27:44.345 --> 27:58.740
the relation, the probable relationship between one male homosexual twin, the likelihood of his twin also being a homosexual, is pretty good, genetically.

27:59.181 --> 27:59.741
It's pretty big.

28:00.442 --> 28:08.631
And I couldn't raise that issue, it seems to me, or the issue of prostitutes in India, without giving Dr. Dharawalla

28:10.231 --> 28:14.457
some contact with HIV, he just has to have it.

28:15.238 --> 28:31.682
It seemed to me it had to be something that would touch his life.

28:32.152 --> 28:35.676
into the story much more than just merely a device in the novel.

28:35.696 --> 28:36.196
Oh, sure.

28:36.616 --> 28:37.357
Oh, no, it does.

28:37.778 --> 28:38.759
It does.

28:39.079 --> 28:50.130
And it really, to me, its presence in the novel, although it's a small presence, is an indication of... It's ominous, certainly.

28:50.490 --> 28:53.613
Yes, it's ominous, and it's an indication of things to come.

28:53.754 --> 29:01.281
It must be... It is a subject on the mind of anyone who has a...

29:01.413 --> 29:11.287
a friend, a family member, a loved one who is homosexual or who is otherwise at risk.

29:11.767 --> 29:22.322
It's just something you... This isn't a national statistic.

29:22.402 --> 29:24.044
I don't offer this one.

29:26.327 --> 29:31.234
But the friends...

29:31.855 --> 29:41.566
I've had who have died of AIDS have all been carried.

29:41.586 --> 29:45.890
I'm not offering that as evidence or proof, but that's just a fact.

29:46.051 --> 29:46.731
Right?

29:46.812 --> 29:47.392
It's a fact.

29:47.713 --> 29:49.374
It's probably the case of most people.

29:49.394 --> 29:54.019
Everyone I know who has died of AIDS is the same.

29:54.180 --> 29:54.300
Yeah.

29:54.320 --> 29:54.440
Yeah.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.343
That's the way it's been.

29:57.363 --> 29:57.643
Yeah.

29:58.524 --> 30:00.867
I noticed here when I was briefly

30:01.336 --> 30:05.802
There's a conversation with Joseph Heller.

30:05.822 --> 30:08.085
I'm interviewing him in New York next month.

30:08.425 --> 30:09.327
Well, give him my best.

30:09.647 --> 30:10.508
I like him very much.

30:10.548 --> 30:12.491
Tim O'Brien sends his best, by the way.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.712
I did an interview with him.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.477
He's my first piece from Minneapolis.

30:17.497 --> 30:19.059
Of course, he's in Minneapolis.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.681
He's a Minneapolis boy, right.

30:21.202 --> 30:23.746
And he had some interest.

30:23.766 --> 30:26.810
I hope we have a chance to get to a few other things.

30:28.031 --> 30:30.955
But the reason I mention Heller, for better or for worse,

30:31.137 --> 30:38.626
Joseph Ellis' first book was Catch-22, and his career is defined by that book.

30:40.008 --> 30:53.285
To the point, of course, Yazarian lives at the end, and he has got his deceased, and I don't think you'd probably consider ever doing a sequel in any case to that book, but his career has been defined by that novel.

30:53.345 --> 30:57.330
Do you feel that your career has been defined by, for better or for
