00:02.748 --> 00:05.431
This is Leanne talking about his dictionary collection.

00:05.451 --> 00:05.751
OK.

00:05.771 --> 00:14.501
So this is, right now in Algeria, there's a battle going on with the Berbers, basically.

00:14.521 --> 00:15.602
It's sort of insurrection.

00:15.962 --> 00:18.645
And the Berbers are trying to assert their rights of the people.

00:18.745 --> 00:21.268
And linguistically, they differ from the Arabs, of course.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.810
This is why I can't get any gum Arabic right now.

00:23.830 --> 00:24.491
Yeah, exactly.

00:24.511 --> 00:30.898
Well, this other voice is Tim Ely, a noted bookmaker and artist.

00:31.182 --> 00:41.877
The language those Verbers speak is Tomashek, it's called, and it's a language for which there was no written form, and for which actually only one major dictionary exists.

00:42.578 --> 00:43.979
And I got that dictionary.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.341
It came out in two volumes.

00:45.702 --> 00:59.200
The man who did it in 1880 and then again the second volume in 1900 had to invent the actual script for the language, and he did it all and did it by hand, and hand lithographed the book.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.582
That's why the book's very rare.

01:01.068 --> 01:08.257
And as far as I've been able to tell, there is no other set of the two volumes anywhere except the set I have.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.879
Is it an extent language?

01:10.039 --> 01:11.081
It's still being spoken.

01:11.101 --> 01:13.964
So it's this language, Tomashek, which is a Berber language.

01:14.445 --> 01:16.668
And I have many Berber languages in the collection.

01:17.148 --> 01:22.155
But it just, it was interesting to me that it's in the news now.

01:23.196 --> 01:28.543
And I have really, I think, the only two-volume set of the early first dictionary of language.

01:28.878 --> 01:34.005
There's never been an English language dictionary yet of this language, Tamashe.

01:34.025 --> 01:35.187
And where again is this place?

01:35.427 --> 01:41.416
It's in northern Africa, Algeria, is where the Berber languages are spoken, in that area.

01:42.197 --> 01:50.929
And similarly, when the Afghani situation was in the news, I had the first dictionary of the Pushtu language.

01:50.949 --> 01:56.016
And it's a dictionary that's so rare that I see I've not been able to find

01:56.333 --> 01:58.736
any other institution that has a copy of it.

01:59.097 --> 02:01.820
So is this a literate society?

02:02.501 --> 02:07.247
This is an oral society that has a language that's never been written down.

02:07.387 --> 02:10.211
So why would they need a dictionary if they couldn't read it?

02:10.231 --> 02:23.168
The dictionaries were created by missionaries in order to spread the gospel, or they were created by explorers for purely scientific and linguistic reasons, or they were created by military figures

02:23.452 --> 02:28.579
who wanted military domination, but they wanted to be able to understand the population.

02:28.619 --> 02:34.587
So those are some of the major... People other than those who... Yeah, they're all bilingual dictionaries.

02:34.767 --> 02:38.572
They're all bilingual, and they're bilingual with many languages.

02:39.013 --> 02:43.038
If it's in the area of Indonesia, they're Dutch bilingual dictionaries.

02:43.418 --> 02:49.206
If it's the indigenous languages of what used to be the Soviet Union, they'll be Russian.

02:50.114 --> 02:52.157
or they'll be, in other cases, Dutch.

02:52.457 --> 02:53.599
I've seen maps.

02:53.979 --> 02:59.146
When I first started this work, I was looking at maps of the Northwest Territories.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.828
I was actually doing some book repair.

03:01.269 --> 03:08.078
An atlas was brought to me, which was a small little volume, and it opened up into this really wonderful book structure that I've used.

03:08.418 --> 03:13.785
But instead of places, because these villages were essentially nomadic, they were just grouped as languages.

03:14.286 --> 03:19.513
And so this would be Tlingit or Haida or something, and it was a great crossover.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.386
And all I could see as I looked at this was that this is a mobile map.

03:25.447 --> 03:34.958
This is a structure that is going to not have townships or boundaries in any conventional Western map-making or cartographic system.

03:35.338 --> 03:37.661
This thing is like a sea of amoebas.

03:37.721 --> 03:42.988
And I have that book, too, the one with the fold-out maps with the languages on it of that area.

03:43.288 --> 03:49.095
But what I was thinking then was that, say, if you looked at this Tomashek,

03:49.885 --> 04:03.099
as an example, or looked at some of the early scripts that were devised in order to try to represent the language for the first time, that you would perhaps, you know, find that an inspiration for a book?

04:03.119 --> 04:04.901
Well, there's great inspiration in that.

04:04.921 --> 04:16.613
Looking at Albertine Gowery's book on Western written forms, just flipping through it, I don't find that I want to emulate them, but then I find that as I work, they get emulated.

04:16.633 --> 04:19.116
And it's a fascinating idea, because I feel it.

04:19.687 --> 04:30.339
these graphic marks for sounds are made up of a really small group of possibilities that you're either going to make a black mark that goes up or down, it's going to cross, it's going to curve.

04:30.740 --> 04:36.566
There's not a lot you can do until you start really abstracting these forms.

04:36.586 --> 04:42.313
So most written languages tend to be graphically graspable.

04:42.473 --> 04:44.175
And I have met people that can read

04:45.674 --> 05:03.392
early Chinese, because they're just visually literate, and they can't grasp the nuance, but they can go through and say, well, this is man, man, house, dog, carrots, possibly dinner, maybe fire, and they're pretty bang on.

05:03.412 --> 05:10.399
And you know that combination of maps and languages, too, that you were talking about could be a very interesting way to go about

05:10.987 --> 05:11.748
something.

05:12.229 --> 05:21.521
We've been fascinated with the notion here and thinking about doing an exhibition called something like No Maps in the Imagination.

05:21.561 --> 05:28.630
That's a boring title, but you know what I mean, in which we would focus on maps of imaginary countries.

05:29.031 --> 05:33.537
Of course, almost every literary work that deals with an imaginary place, Lord of the Rings.

05:33.797 --> 05:37.382
There is a book that's published that emphasizes the art

05:37.767 --> 05:39.349
side of that, mostly.

05:39.389 --> 05:45.797
And I was interested in the way in which the literary texts, the created maps for literary texts.

05:45.817 --> 05:53.045
But anyway, it's just a coarser, as you know, a richly evocative sort of thing to look at and deal with maps.

05:53.246 --> 05:54.607
I have a question for you, Mr. Ely.

05:54.627 --> 06:04.399
When you're creating a book, it's a unique book, and it's preferable, I guess, but as you're talking about these various codes that you embed in the book,

06:05.307 --> 06:06.548
Do you visualize a reader?

06:06.649 --> 06:09.312
Is this book being created for a reader of one?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.534
I mean, because it's one book that you're making.

06:11.834 --> 06:15.679
And also, for the one reader, you're also making it very difficult to penetrate.

06:15.919 --> 06:17.621
Oh, I'm making it impenetrable.

06:18.442 --> 06:21.666
Well, I've always loved... So who are you creating the book for?

06:21.786 --> 06:28.193
Edgar Allan Poe's Goldbug story has a code that, for a very long time, people thought was real code.

06:28.645 --> 06:30.027
just because it looked so good.

06:30.047 --> 06:33.591
And it was finally deciphered and found that it wasn't a code.

06:33.611 --> 06:35.093
It was just verisimilitude.

06:35.133 --> 06:55.316
And I've always loved that idea of taking something out of Principia and writing the equation out, and then just screwing it up, copying it badly, so that someone that is a specialist would look at this thing and go, well, it's OK, except it's spelled wrong.

06:55.356 --> 06:58.500
We used to lift phrases out of words.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.128
Phrases out of phrase books.

07:00.829 --> 07:04.374
And I stopped doing it because I found the phrase books were usually wrong.

07:04.534 --> 07:08.299
So somebody who was fluent in French would go, well, your grammar here is terrible.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.182
OK, so I won't do that.

07:10.883 --> 07:18.493
I tend to think of these things as I don't really know unless it's a commission and I'm making it for someone.

07:19.414 --> 07:20.596
I don't know where this book's going to go.

07:21.037 --> 07:23.560
And I love the idea that I could slip this volume

07:24.097 --> 07:30.925
uncataloged into, like, the San Francisco Public Library, and somebody would try to shut it.

07:30.945 --> 07:31.686
Don't put it in that library, though.

07:31.706 --> 07:32.487
You know, it was discarded.

07:32.507 --> 07:39.996
Or take it to Powell's in Portland and just shelve it, and maybe write, you know, eight dollars on the flyleaf.

07:40.717 --> 07:49.648
And what, if there is to be any furor that will erupt when somebody takes this thing up to check out, you know, eight dollars on this

07:50.050 --> 07:52.473
What is this?

07:53.154 --> 07:58.562
And just step back and watch.

07:58.582 --> 08:00.024
But I'm very amused by these.

08:00.084 --> 08:01.066
I love to make these.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.451
I think I got the best job in the world, but then I think maybe Jim's job is better.

08:06.253 --> 08:17.169
And so I had a really potent dream as a child that I found a book about this size that explained how all these marvelous technical inventions were made.

08:17.269 --> 08:19.973
And I tried to make that book when I was too young.

08:20.695 --> 08:24.020
my attention span was too short, and it just didn't happen.

08:24.040 --> 08:37.841
But the dream was so vivid that when I later started to make books, I realized that maybe there's something very pivotal in that mental propellant that would make me want to make books over paintings.

08:37.861 --> 08:47.195
I make paintings occasionally, and my last exhibition was paintings, but it had none of the buzz that making a book had near me.

08:47.215 --> 08:48.357
I don't fight it anymore.

08:48.377 --> 08:48.998
I just realized

08:49.957 --> 09:02.615
I want to see this thing be this very intimate experience that someone can be given this book, and I can leave it alone for as long as it takes, and they report back to me that they've been changed.

09:02.635 --> 09:03.717
But it is one, so one.

09:03.737 --> 09:04.778
It is one, yeah.

09:04.798 --> 09:05.740
I've made a few additions.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.642
Printing is not something that appeals to you.

09:08.544 --> 09:12.489
I feel like I'm more pre-Gutenberg.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.412
Only because I think that

09:16.805 --> 09:18.867
I love making etchings.

09:18.967 --> 09:24.452
I've recently made another printed book, but the edition size is so small, I might as well be unique.

09:24.472 --> 09:27.275
There's six, and the only one has been bounced.

09:27.295 --> 09:28.456
The rest are in the drawer.

09:29.457 --> 09:32.279
Is it one with the text, then, as such?

09:32.359 --> 09:34.902
No, it's all etching fragments.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.964
It's yours, yeah.

09:37.484 --> 09:38.926
But I get closer to a texture.

09:39.346 --> 09:43.690
You may not have come in yet when we were discussing the idea

09:43.957 --> 09:50.466
the fact that the Lilly collects early cryptography books, and obviously there's a relationship here.

09:50.667 --> 10:04.367
And I like the sense of Tim's work some way as a sort of code, a cryptographic book that you think you can figure out, and you can't really.

10:04.527 --> 10:08.833
At one point, there were codes that you could decipher, and they were very simple

10:09.168 --> 10:11.650
But I would always tend to forget the key.

10:12.231 --> 10:18.537
So I'd go back and say, I can't tell this, and I'm not really patient enough to try and make this happen.

10:19.418 --> 10:27.646
But it seemed like a very interesting idea to take important passages that were important to me and to just insightful them in some way.

10:28.526 --> 10:35.113
And then I figured, well, I've got to figure out a way to put the key in the book so that I can remember it.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.555
Because I'll often be just, I work so

10:38.125 --> 10:41.510
I'll work on some projects, and by the time the thing is done, I kind of go, well, that's done.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.092
Let's move on to the next one.

10:43.112 --> 10:44.494
And someone will say, what's this book about?

10:45.455 --> 10:45.956
Hang on.

10:46.036 --> 10:52.665
Let me go back to maybe Sketchbook 49 has some reference as to why this thing came into being.

10:52.846 --> 10:58.634
We were also talking about cookbooks as ideas, you know, of inspiration, perhaps, even.

10:58.894 --> 11:04.181
And Tim said, well, maybe you might do a cryptographic cookbook.

11:04.242 --> 11:06.765
I could encipher all of my

11:07.268 --> 11:08.369
egg-tempered recipes.

11:08.549 --> 11:09.350
Exactly.

11:09.370 --> 11:14.155
And then if you didn't read the code right, you might be poisoned at the end rather than fed.

11:14.676 --> 11:16.378
You could die from this book.

11:16.398 --> 11:19.761
And you'd have that caveat in code, too.

11:20.602 --> 11:31.774
The other obvious area, and I know, is magic books, books of the occult, and so forth, because many people would immediately think, well, there may be something

11:32.497 --> 11:35.060
These do not seem demonic in any way.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.964
No, they're pretty much on the white side.

11:38.044 --> 11:40.126
Yeah, they are very much on the white side.

11:40.146 --> 11:41.148
I'm definitely inspired by you.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.549
This stuff would have me burned at the stake.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.470
Yeah, exactly.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.952
This is what I was trying to say.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.134
You wouldn't be alive.

11:46.154 --> 11:47.115
That's a great one.

11:47.135 --> 11:49.277
Free Gutenberg.

11:49.297 --> 11:50.118
It's just the stuff I make.

11:50.199 --> 11:51.140
It's the stuff I own.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.102
And they just go, oh, man, you're out of here.

11:53.182 --> 11:55.946
So for those who can decipher this, are there rewards?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.411
Or is it the exercise that's the thing?

12:01.049 --> 12:02.190
I'd say both.

12:02.250 --> 12:19.750
I think that for me, the joy is in the exercise and in the ongoing challenge of making books that my mentors, my heroes, like Bernard Middleton and Philip Smith, you know, if Bernard looks at this and goes, this isn't too bad, then I know I'm fine.

12:19.830 --> 12:26.218
And now that I've got Philip's stamp of approval, I think, okay, that's good.

12:27.900 --> 12:28.500
I'm almost there.

12:29.021 --> 12:30.803
But I'm really fussy, so

12:31.340 --> 12:35.386
I wrestle with a lot of the technical issues and just my own personal buzz.

12:36.067 --> 12:55.156
But I think that the people that I know that have these, if they can stand inside the mystery and not need to be either told what it means or if they don't quest for an answer, they expand.

12:55.177 --> 12:59.423
And the ones that the people that I find have the most difficulty with them

12:59.791 --> 13:01.074
want that answer.

13:01.374 --> 13:03.720
They want to know what it's about.

13:03.740 --> 13:11.477
When Chronicle Books published The Flight Into Egypt, the marketing people wanted, you know, one paragraph, just tell us what this thing is about.

13:11.637 --> 13:14.303
I go, oh, that's your job.

13:14.844 --> 13:19.875
I can tell you what I think it's about, but you have to know that that's conditional on

13:20.682 --> 13:49.660
a lot of things it's not an is it's a seems to be a thing that i find as a reader looking at the book thinking about reading a book like this is that most books that you pick up when you begin them you know what it means to read them it means you go through to the end and you're finished and you put the book down when you pick up a book like this you just want to keep going back to it again and again and there is no sense really that you started them you know and turn the pages to the end

13:49.859 --> 13:53.344
and you've read the book, it's a different sort of reading.

13:54.386 --> 13:58.653
It doesn't end, really, in a normal way.

13:58.733 --> 13:59.654
It's a sphere.

13:59.674 --> 14:01.277
I think it's fantastic.

14:01.297 --> 14:03.360
This is the only one I think of.

14:03.700 --> 14:12.915
There are books that circle on themselves, but Joyce's Finnegan's Way, that ends with the middle half of a sentence that's the first sentence of the book.

14:12.935 --> 14:17.622
At last, along the, and then it starts at the beginning river, run past Eve and Adam's.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.059
and so forth.

14:19.079 --> 14:22.023
There have been other books, too, that sort of bite their own tail.

14:24.025 --> 14:26.388
Which is, you know, the invitation into transformation.

14:27.469 --> 14:30.092
That book is transformative that way.

14:30.112 --> 14:36.940
I think just that idea of, I had a friend in college that always started to sketch books at both ends and toward the middle.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.762
It just made me crazy.

14:39.623 --> 14:47.052
And so I still find that I play these things out like it's a piece of music and that there's a really loud portion somewhere, but at the end.

14:47.386 --> 14:54.375
Finnegan's Wake is a book that I think we can honestly say that no one has ever read.

14:54.535 --> 15:01.804
I've been professionally... I read it in the sense that I passed my eyes over it from the first page to the last page.

15:02.224 --> 15:12.297
But there only were truly probably half a dozen people to a dozen in the world who have actually had some sort of grasp of Finnegan's Wake in a fuller way.

15:12.614 --> 15:20.367
There are pages in which people don't know really what's going on very well at all, in spite of having a guide, a sort of skeleton's key.

15:21.108 --> 15:29.221
All of that makes me think that Finnegan's Wave might be an inspiration to you, too, to do a book, because it's filled with dreams, it's filled with images.

15:29.281 --> 15:35.271
The problem is that you nor anybody else can actually read Finnegan's Wave.

15:35.291 --> 15:39.718
It's more a dipping into, say, dip in here, dip in there,

15:39.952 --> 15:41.834
And something comes out of it.

15:41.854 --> 15:49.322
Terence McKenna used to use it as a kind of ocular device, where he would be lecturing.

15:49.342 --> 15:51.084
And he'd say, let's just see what the book says.

15:51.124 --> 15:54.307
And he would crack Finnegan's way to read a sentence or two.

15:55.068 --> 15:57.891
And he'd go, yes, that is appropriate to what we're talking about.

15:57.911 --> 16:01.575
And he'd watch, and that's something that I heard about psychedelic mushrooms.

16:02.015 --> 16:02.296
Yeah, exactly.

16:02.316 --> 16:08.322
And it always seemed to work at least as a hinge point, whether or not it was real.

16:08.757 --> 16:17.510
I think maybe the second academic publication I had was a publication in a thing that was called the Waite Newsletter.

16:17.570 --> 16:24.260
It was little bits about Finnegan's Waite published in Australia, I think, at the time.

16:24.640 --> 16:34.815
But at any rate, I wrote on one paragraph of Finnegan's Waite 12 pages, and of course I didn't begin to say everything that was in that paragraph of interest, but that's typical.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.366
You're sticking your head into a particle accelerator, and there's just so much in there.

16:41.368 --> 16:47.716
It's like trying to report back on a dream you had after a few sentences.

16:47.736 --> 16:48.698
It fails to English.

16:51.442 --> 17:04.600
When you mention magic, I don't know that I'm a believer in it as a belief system, but there are things that have popped up, things like the magic square as a

17:05.035 --> 17:06.136
divination device.

17:07.177 --> 17:24.574
So I've been using magic squares, or Vedic systems, and number systems, so that, well, when we talked about you giving me an inspiration, maybe I get a set of numbers, GPS coordinates, the year the library was built.

17:25.035 --> 17:26.356
It could be a pile of things.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.199
And I code those numbers out to give myself a shape.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.161
That shape is lifted.

17:31.394 --> 17:45.178
and can be expanded or reduced and that becomes a pattern that looks very linear and looks just like a pattern, a tiling, a nothingness.

17:45.198 --> 17:50.027
But it has built into it those coordinates that are specific.

17:50.463 --> 17:53.507
I think this is the square of Jupiter.

17:54.569 --> 17:58.033
And I've been working on a bunch of books called The Tables of Mercury.

17:58.053 --> 18:02.840
I think the Mercury square is 8 by 8, which gives me more numbers, more permutations.

18:02.860 --> 18:17.500
And so just by creating these little simple devices, look at the device in terms of what's its original meaning, what is this thing about it, what's something to give one a suspicious marriage or wealth.

18:17.885 --> 18:31.987
But it also can be this other thing, and just by simply rotating it, playing with it, I suddenly get this new entry into decorative book binding that nobody would cooperate and relate with.

18:32.007 --> 18:43.285
What I like about Tim's work so much is the way it allows people who love books to look at books in a new way, and to see books in a new way as well.

18:43.703 --> 18:48.289
Very interestingly, you said you sort of twitch when they're thinking about, oh, where should this be?

18:48.890 --> 18:53.176
Books should be where people want them and where people love to have them.

18:53.236 --> 18:55.419
I mean, that's what's really important.

18:55.800 --> 19:01.628
But it is true that the sort of books you create, on the one hand, a normal library to say, that's not

19:02.063 --> 19:03.685
got any text in it.

19:03.765 --> 19:04.446
It's not a book.

19:04.967 --> 19:08.913
And a normal art museum would say, we can't put that on the wall.

19:09.153 --> 19:10.555
That's a sort of book.

19:10.575 --> 19:11.576
We don't know what to do.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.480
And so they fall between.

19:14.560 --> 19:28.019
And one thing I'm really interested in doing at the Lilly is building into this area and picking up in this area that might otherwise be lost between institutions some way and building it in.

19:28.039 --> 19:29.461
I think it was UCLA.

19:29.521 --> 19:30.703
And they said, well, we don't collect

19:31.156 --> 19:33.779
We only collect editions.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.521
It's all fine.

19:36.062 --> 19:49.818
And there certainly could be unique works of art that you would say were of no particular interest to a library as such, because they would be simply works of art that were bound together into the notebook or something.

19:50.719 --> 19:54.063
Your work is so directly related to books.

19:54.163 --> 19:54.804
It is books.

19:54.824 --> 19:58.648
They are books, and they're so directly related to the world of ideas.

19:59.152 --> 20:04.700
and the world of texts, if that's something special.

20:04.720 --> 20:11.270
I didn't realize how large an examination that would be when I started making these things.

20:11.290 --> 20:21.986
It was awfully casual, and I thought, well, this is just a way for me to get my drawings, or eventually my prints, into a form that is like a portfolio presentation.

20:22.266 --> 20:24.069
And then one thing led to another.

20:24.089 --> 20:28.095
I met a conservator, and the conservator suggested boxes,

20:28.497 --> 20:39.169
That suggested the package deal, and little metaphors crept in, and more information crept in, and I suddenly realized, my god, libraries, that's where he is at.

20:39.189 --> 20:50.180
If I simply look at these things, the raw material is going to occupy me for the rest of my days, without even a number of scratches.

20:50.200 --> 20:57.188
And the interesting thing, too, that you're doing is, and that might be interesting for you, Nick, is that you're creating

20:57.573 --> 20:59.576
a readership of a different sort.

21:00.116 --> 21:05.143
We all know what readers of novels are, and we all know what people who look at pictures are.

21:05.904 --> 21:26.652
But the readership, what you're creating here is a new sort of readership of people who are interested in books, interested in text, interested in the way, in the codex, the way things are structured, and the way they're put together as books, and interested in codes, and in visual codes, and in also

21:26.969 --> 21:29.432
scripts, and you put all that together.

21:30.093 --> 21:36.841
It's a very small readership because, since the books are unique, a person has to actually hold that book in their hands.

21:36.901 --> 21:41.306
And how many people are going to get to do it here in, say, in the Lilly Library?

21:42.508 --> 21:51.078
It happens because our collections are open to the readers to actually use, not to take away, but within our reading room under our controlled conditions.

21:51.599 --> 21:56.605
People actually take things and look at them, and Jim uses them, and we use them in class.

21:57.108 --> 22:01.732
And so there'll be more readers here than there would be in a private collection.

22:01.752 --> 22:03.714
And the work that grabs, that's nice.

22:03.754 --> 22:09.900
Someone comes in and has that experience and tells someone about it, and you see them, another student, come venture in.

22:09.920 --> 22:20.109
And of course, you can also inspire other artists until there's, you know, until there's an explosion of books that look very much like Tim Ely's books, but maybe not quite as good.

22:20.229 --> 22:27.115
There was a fellow in Eugene that went to the Multnomah College Library in Portland,

22:27.719 --> 22:47.242
a recent acquisition, and I can just see that he's trapped in this fever dream of emulation, and he's desperately trying to work out of it, but the circles and diagrams keep intruding into his work, and it's just a matter of time until he gets out of his system, but it's a virus.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.365
We were talking about that last night.

22:49.385 --> 22:51.087
Moving beyond your teacher.

22:51.327 --> 22:52.308
And here's the other thing.

22:52.368 --> 22:55.532
In your work, there's a beauty and a precision that

22:55.833 --> 23:01.759
is extremely inspirational, I would think, but extremely hard to emulate.

23:01.779 --> 23:13.551
And I would think anyone who was really inspired wouldn't dare try to go in your direction, because what could they do to make it finer, in a way?

23:13.611 --> 23:22.360
They would better go into something a little different so they don't look like an imitator, and not even a particularly good imitator, perhaps.

23:22.380 --> 23:25.063
So have you allowed any of these books to be digitized?

23:25.702 --> 23:27.044
Are there digital copies?

23:29.048 --> 23:34.217
I have a handful of digital photographs, but I haven't quite gotten to that end yet, I guess.

23:34.237 --> 23:36.220
Because it was kind of changed the dynamic entirely.

23:36.240 --> 23:45.176
What we would probably do here, we already have a miniature, and we're having from the Hubert's a copy of the book.

23:45.196 --> 23:46.258
Do we have any?

23:46.559 --> 23:48.622
Any of your books, a large book?

23:48.642 --> 23:48.702
No.

23:48.722 --> 23:49.343
A larger book?

23:49.363 --> 23:50.745
Okay, so that's what we want to get.

23:50.765 --> 23:55.031
But at any rate, what we might well do is make digital images.

23:55.812 --> 24:05.084
We'll talk with you about that, but make digital images and put them on our website so that someone could come and click, click, click, click, and go through a book that we hold.

24:05.105 --> 24:09.330
So it really wouldn't be... Then it would be available to a wider audience.

24:09.350 --> 24:16.380
I think that would be a great idea because I know you... I don't think you have a desire...

24:16.664 --> 24:18.447
that not many people see your work.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.692
I mean, you'd probably like to have... Is it tactile?

24:21.752 --> 24:22.674
Is it tactility?

24:23.095 --> 24:23.535
Of course.

24:23.676 --> 24:24.697
It is to me.

24:25.639 --> 24:26.661
Books feel good.

24:26.721 --> 24:38.500
And I had a really hard time reading Henry James in college, and somebody said, go over to the library and get a real edition of this, and you can actually touch, type with paper.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.946
Get it out of this little tiny thing that you're struggling with,

24:42.162 --> 24:46.529
And it changed my life.

24:48.974 --> 24:56.226
The idea of these images would be that it would get people excited about coming in to look at the book.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.348
It wouldn't be a substitute.

24:57.408 --> 25:03.158
I've made postcards of some of these pages, and my own art education.

25:03.543 --> 25:07.508
I went to college up near the Canadian border, and so, you know, there was an art museum.

25:07.528 --> 25:09.550
So I didn't see a real Jackson Pollock painting.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.733
I thought they were all this big for years.

25:11.753 --> 25:12.974
And I finally saw them.

25:13.315 --> 25:14.496
I was like, oh, my God.

25:14.516 --> 25:15.818
The bigger than you thought.

25:15.838 --> 25:16.378
I had to revise everything.

25:16.398 --> 25:20.884
And the Salvador Dali painting, The Persistence of Memory, is only this big.

25:20.984 --> 25:22.586
But I always thought it was this big.

25:22.606 --> 25:24.408
So I kept thinking it was going to be.

25:24.428 --> 25:26.851
So I still have a great deal of difficult scale.

25:27.131 --> 25:32.858
We have another exhibition I've been thinking of doing, and I think it'll be a fascinating one.

25:33.209 --> 25:49.145
is an exhibition in which the original work, in the way in which the author or artist intended it to be seen, is exhibited side by side with a Norton anthology reprint, or a reclame reprint, or one of the smaller ones.

25:49.165 --> 26:02.338
And that would then, for instance, take something like Le Stefan Georg's poetry in the little reclame edition, and put it beside the huge, beautiful hand-done

26:02.808 --> 26:06.717
I have a whole chapter on this concept in my new book.

26:06.998 --> 26:15.960
This whole element of paratex, the elements that make them, the way the author intended it to be experienced.

26:16.140 --> 26:20.310
Trisprim Shandy, for instance, where you have to see

26:20.577 --> 26:21.940
the first edition of that book.

26:21.960 --> 26:22.441
Exactly.

26:22.601 --> 26:23.944
This is the thing.

26:23.964 --> 26:25.968
And there's... Oh, Blake's books.

26:25.988 --> 26:27.151
I mean, every one is different.

26:27.171 --> 26:27.552
Exactly.

26:27.672 --> 26:33.204
And you have to experience the art with poetry to get what he intended for you to experience.

26:33.224 --> 26:36.010
I don't know if you know the author, Bill, William Bowman.

26:36.030 --> 26:36.390
I know.

26:36.551 --> 26:37.813
I'm sure.

26:37.894 --> 26:40.038
Okay, so we know Bill, so I know him.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.421
He...

26:41.840 --> 26:48.128
As you may know, his work's published mostly by, they were published by Grove Press and Pantheon and others.

26:48.769 --> 27:09.957
And in order for his, he said, in order for him to present the books the way he wanted to present them, he founded a press called the Cotangent Press, and he produced a limited number of each of his shorter books, these are, fewer than ten copies of each one in the format that he intended

27:10.493 --> 27:14.258
And I have now, as personally, I've got those.

27:14.278 --> 27:17.181
I have a complete collection of all of these limited editions.

27:17.322 --> 27:24.651
Now, the cotangent, say the first edition, take the one of Butterfly Stories.

27:24.671 --> 27:26.333
It's about prostitutes in Thailand.

27:26.834 --> 27:33.282
In Grove Press, it comes out in a normal, small octavo format with black and white drawing illustrations.

27:34.323 --> 27:39.690
What I have is the original full-size thing, and he did

27:40.396 --> 27:50.470
He was going to do ten copies of them, and when I got it, he produced it for me, actually, and bound it, because he'd done so few, and there was no colophon on the book.

27:50.670 --> 27:56.739
And I said, don't, we need a colophon to notice, but you said there were going to be ten copies of it.

27:56.759 --> 28:04.169
He said, well, okay, so he sent me a hand-done colophon to put in the book, and it said, you know, this book was done so-and-so.

28:04.209 --> 28:07.213
There have been, three copies have been produced,

28:07.480 --> 28:15.979
The first two were given to prostitutes in Thailand, and given the nature of their lives and the weather, these have probably disappeared.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.846
This is copy number three, and that's all.

28:18.966 --> 28:23.717
He hasn't done any more copies, probably won't do any more copies.

28:24.743 --> 28:28.787
I could lay that side by side with the gold press edition, for example.

28:28.827 --> 28:37.576
Well, my play in Egypt is this big, massive thing, and the facsimile is this little square piece of tile printed on the wrong paper.

28:37.637 --> 28:41.841
They didn't look at the end paper, so they printed it backwards.

28:41.861 --> 28:42.462
Oh, my gosh.

28:42.502 --> 28:44.764
Just all kinds of really great things.

28:44.904 --> 28:45.865
Chronicle books, you said?

28:46.045 --> 28:46.526
Chronicle books.

28:46.546 --> 28:47.066
When did they do it?

28:47.086 --> 28:48.568
1995.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.333
So this was a book you shared.

28:53.583 --> 28:54.885
This is what I shared.

28:54.945 --> 28:57.108
They were in New York for some reason.

28:57.128 --> 29:02.416
They went to Granary Books and saw this book, amongst other things, and said, well, we need to do this book.

29:02.436 --> 29:08.005
And it was one of those publishing nightmares that, being totally inexperienced, there were no publishers.

29:08.225 --> 29:10.048
I was taken to the cleaners.

29:10.068 --> 29:11.470
And they didn't know what to do with this thing.

29:11.590 --> 29:13.273
So it was hardly distributed.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.775
It sold very poorly.

29:15.356 --> 29:19.161
And I kept telling them, well, it's not about something you can't.

29:19.322 --> 29:22.847
Barnes & Noble had it categorized, if you looked it up on that catalog, as big.

29:23.232 --> 29:26.595
Don't tell Bradley, they put me in.

29:26.615 --> 29:27.356
Search for big.

29:27.416 --> 29:28.097
Search for big.

29:28.117 --> 29:28.817
You're in how-to?

29:29.118 --> 29:33.142
Barnes & Noble, they're going in on my general basis.

29:33.182 --> 29:34.903
How to collect, which is ridiculous.

29:35.084 --> 29:38.287
You can't learn anything.

29:38.507 --> 29:43.772
But I've got a nice little pile of these things left, and it's a very interesting thing.

29:43.832 --> 29:48.096
It's almost like it's a translation, and it's probably a bad translation.

29:48.196 --> 29:51.940
I keep thinking, well, authors write text and publishers

29:52.308 --> 29:58.056
take those things and run through a blender of some kind and out the other end, if you're lucky, it's gorgeous.

29:58.436 --> 30:01.681
And under normal conditions, it's a little paperback.

30:02.021 --> 30:12.055
Another example that I would put in the exhibit is that Franz Kafka's early text, he specified the typeface they were to be in, and he wanted the largest possible typeface

30:12.338 --> 30:16.986
that could be used in the book, because he considered his prose to be like poetry.

30:17.307 --> 30:19.390
He wanted to slow down the reading process.

30:19.871 --> 30:28.626
Well, the typeface is not a particularly beautiful result as a piece of bookmaking, and the typeface is very big.

30:29.804 --> 30:32.027
It's never been reprinted in that size, though.

30:32.047 --> 30:41.679
And I think that people who love Kafka and are interested in Kafka's writing should at least realize that when they read this story, that Kafka wanted it to look like the first edition.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.383
They should see the first edition and see what he felt.

30:44.984 --> 30:49.570
In fact, later, after the first one had come out, he wrote to the publishers again.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.012
That was Kurt Wolfen.

30:51.032 --> 30:52.133
And he said, you know,

30:52.417 --> 30:56.681
please, I'd like that big typeface again, if we can do it.

30:56.701 --> 30:58.563
A great example is Vanity Fair.

30:58.603 --> 31:10.656
I mean, Thackeray did illustrations, and he did all of the illuminations, and only the first printing has his, in fact, the subtitle when it was serialized was Pen and Pencil Sketches of London, or whatever.

31:10.676 --> 31:14.660
And every edition of Vanity Fair is totally devoid.

31:14.680 --> 31:19.825
None of them have his illustrations, which would seem to me really part of what he wanted you to

31:20.159 --> 31:21.702
to experience it than with the book.

31:21.842 --> 31:23.084
That would be another reason.

31:23.104 --> 31:23.806
Exactly.

31:23.906 --> 31:32.502
Well, Philip Smith's book by itself is great, but I read it probably once a year, and there aren't big holes in it.

31:32.522 --> 31:42.741
And I found out that he asked the publisher to print the book so that the paper grain was correct, so that he could do some bindings on it, or other people might consider doing some bindings.

31:43.143 --> 31:47.329
But there are also 80 pages of the manuscript that just were a little run out of page space.

31:47.349 --> 31:54.020
And yet there are huge areas where there's just nothing except a little spot illustration of something irrelevant to the chapter.

31:54.060 --> 31:58.987
And it's almost as if they took the manuscript and threw it in the air, shook it down, said, get this to be positive.

32:00.029 --> 32:09.403
And so I decided I'm going to ask them if I could see the original manuscript, because there are processes that it just suddenly stops and go, I know this book isn't done.

32:09.653 --> 32:12.177
What happens after Step 70?

32:13.619 --> 32:15.462
You know the thing about size.

32:15.643 --> 32:18.547
Again, Bowman wrote a book on the history of violence.

32:18.568 --> 32:21.312
It's just come out, Violence Against Women, primarily.

32:21.753 --> 32:25.940
And no publisher would touch it because it was so long.

32:26.040 --> 32:35.475
And then David Eggers, after he had such great success with a novel of heartbreaking or staggering genius, I forget the exact title.

32:35.810 --> 32:40.834
He subsidized this, and it's come out now in seven volumes, box set.

32:40.854 --> 32:47.320
But then it will be reduced to one volume for public consumption in a more commercial... It got a huge review in the New York Times.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.243
It did, it did, because Volman is such a crazy man.

32:50.263 --> 32:51.344
Oh, he is so crazy.

32:51.904 --> 32:59.751
But he is, and I have to die before long, but... He's charmed, he's charmed, I swear.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.973
He makes it through a lot, doesn't he?

33:02.193 --> 33:04.095
But he just...

33:04.936 --> 33:07.159
He just writes obsessively.

33:07.239 --> 33:09.482
He just can't stop writing.

33:09.642 --> 33:12.866
And a lot of what he writes just seems like genius.

33:12.946 --> 33:17.872
And then a lot of it just goes over the top, and people can't stand it.

33:17.892 --> 33:24.260
And so these long articles will come out because people say, and one early reviewer said this in the New Republic.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.465
He said, I just felt like I have to come to terms with his work and try to figure it out.

33:28.946 --> 33:34.673
And most of the people who look at the whole sum of what he does are very positive about

33:35.075 --> 33:38.398
about what he can represent for American literature.

33:38.438 --> 33:42.763
There's stuff going on there, but I think he's just, you know, it's going to take a long time to sort it out.

33:42.943 --> 33:46.326
He's easily ten years younger than I am.

33:46.386 --> 33:48.428
He's so unbelievably prodigious.

33:48.688 --> 33:51.872
I've met him just yesterday.

33:51.892 --> 33:55.715
The Bright and Risen Angels had just come out in England.

33:56.736 --> 33:57.457
That was early.

33:57.517 --> 34:03.343
I never got all the way through it, but there was one paragraph that was just so mind-numbingly awesome.

34:03.593 --> 34:07.398
that I knew I had to get something going with this guy.

34:07.679 --> 34:18.014
I was sort of this advisor, he'd call me up and say, I'm going to Cambodia next week, and I'll bring you back some stuff, but I need to know what I can take for art materials, because it's really unit.

34:18.034 --> 34:21.458
So we'd get him out and set up so we could take paper and bring his materials.

34:22.139 --> 34:31.693
Then he'd call me back and say, you know, I was there, and I didn't bring any dirt back from this trip, because I kept sorting through it, and I kept finding human bones and shell casings.

34:31.960 --> 34:38.367
Yeah, that would have been a little... I don't know that I would... I probably would have had to have filtered that.

34:38.387 --> 34:40.550
As you know, he works into his vines.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.312
He's the one I have of Butterfly Stories.

34:42.712 --> 34:48.839
He includes in them things like bits of the bras of prostitutes and used condoms.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.082
Not the type of thing you normally want to handle.

34:51.462 --> 34:53.425
He called me up the first time and said, I have a book.

34:53.725 --> 34:54.826
I've met somebody that knows you.

34:54.846 --> 34:56.568
I want to meet you.

34:56.588 --> 34:58.170
So he comes up and brings this book.

34:59.416 --> 35:01.498
His correspondences were women in prison.

35:01.719 --> 35:02.540
What was it called?

35:03.040 --> 35:03.961
Convict Bird.

35:04.001 --> 35:04.582
Convict Bird.

35:05.123 --> 35:12.331
And he shows up with this little, delicate inkjet or laser print on Japanese paper, but it was in this steel box.

35:12.351 --> 35:13.272
Yeah, we've got that.

35:13.713 --> 35:19.860
And he carried this thing up to the fourth floor of my apartment, and he put down padding.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.382
He said, this is going to scratch your tables.

35:21.402 --> 35:25.727
I'm going to lift this cauldron out, set it down, and unlatch this thing in.

35:26.213 --> 35:29.778
It was a hot July day, and he was just sweating with this little thing.

35:30.619 --> 35:33.022
I was like, oh my god, there's this braid from this woman's hair.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.865
Yes, that's it.

35:34.885 --> 35:37.388
A lot from the hair of a prostitute in prison.

35:37.408 --> 35:40.513
I started reading this thing, and it was just astonishing.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.816
And this is what he wanted to do.

35:42.896 --> 35:46.240
And did I have any suggestions of where he could go with these?

35:46.260 --> 35:47.462
And I sent him off to some dealers.

35:47.948 --> 35:53.354
And they were just far too used to the relationship with my father.

35:53.394 --> 35:59.600
And Bill shows up, and I go, oh, my God, this is really interesting, but not for me.

35:59.660 --> 36:08.490
There is a dealer now who handles his works, and that's how I got in touch with him and actually bought everything that he had done, basically.

36:09.110 --> 36:12.194
That's Priscilla Givalis, who's doing that now.

36:12.214 --> 36:15.357
But I'll tell you an interesting story there.

36:15.573 --> 36:23.240
At the time, I decided I wanted to get everything that Bill had done, and I didn't know him personally.

36:23.481 --> 36:30.728
I just thought it was so interesting, the whole concept of creating what you want, as opposed to the commercial edition.

36:30.748 --> 36:37.554
And that first one was published in ten copies, and I couldn't find one.

36:37.595 --> 36:38.956
There wasn't one available.

36:38.976 --> 36:43.200
So I said to him, do you have a copy of number one?

36:43.568 --> 36:44.910
You know, first one, one, and ten.

36:44.930 --> 36:48.234
And he said, no, but I'll make you a copy.

36:48.494 --> 36:51.739
I'll make a special copy for you, a unique copy.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.661
So I said, all right.

36:53.741 --> 36:59.408
So what he did was he did a unique copy of one for me.

37:00.069 --> 37:02.192
She called it second edition and one copy.

37:03.253 --> 37:05.897
But it was he did a different binding.

37:05.917 --> 37:12.225
He did the binding all himself with an etching into the cover of steel and cover.

37:13.336 --> 37:18.203
And inside, he did the whole book by hand and hand-colored it.

37:18.624 --> 37:20.948
And the original is only in black and white.

37:21.228 --> 37:22.570
So I've got this beautiful thing.

37:22.610 --> 37:30.763
And then eventually, of course, I also found the first edition with the lock of hair and everything so that I have both now.

37:31.223 --> 37:32.886
But he's also willing to do that.

37:33.006 --> 37:35.830
He will make a unique book for someone.

37:35.850 --> 37:36.792
Talk about energy.

37:36.912 --> 37:37.393
He's a player.

37:37.413 --> 37:38.314
Talk about energy.

37:38.615 --> 37:41.659
I'm going to say 43 to 45.

37:41.679 --> 37:42.780
Yeah, 43 to 45.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.904
I met him when I was, I think he was in his 20s when I met him.

37:45.924 --> 37:48.146
He was still going off on these killer expeditions.

37:48.186 --> 37:51.430
He'd call me and say, I just got back from the Arctic.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.232
I just about died, but they sold me to Washington.

37:53.252 --> 37:56.636
Do you know, he spent part of his youth here in Bloomington.

37:56.656 --> 38:04.325
His father was on the faculty of the School of Business, and he wrote to me, and he said, I remember well going into the lily and reading H.B.

38:05.226 --> 38:05.787
Lovecraft.

38:06.323 --> 38:09.926
He remembered the lily, he remembered reading here.

38:10.467 --> 38:28.284
He won't come back here, not for publication, but he won't come back here because he was with a photographer friend of his in Bosnia or Yugoslavia, and they were shot at, and his friend was killed right next to him in the car.

38:28.784 --> 38:32.668
And that friend came from Bloomington, and the mother is still here.

38:32.986 --> 38:38.654
I said, why don't you come back to Bloomington, as long as he didn't bring his gun with him, which he carries around.

38:39.094 --> 38:41.077
And he said, I can't.

38:41.638 --> 38:43.380
He said, I can't return to Bloomington.

38:43.400 --> 38:47.666
He said, I'm afraid that my friend's mother, it would be too hard for her.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.648
She knew I was there.

38:48.728 --> 38:53.534
He said, she really, really dislikes me because of what happened.

38:53.654 --> 38:58.581
And he said, I just can't come back to Bloomington, which I thought was interesting.

38:58.601 --> 38:59.342
But his stuff is here.

39:00.324 --> 39:02.807
Well, we've all these books.

39:03.243 --> 39:09.130
Again, right now, they're in my collection, but they're for the lily traditions.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.736
I think, let's see, Fathers and Crows, maybe three or four books that Deutsch published.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.660
I did the jacket and designed them for.

39:17.680 --> 39:18.100
Oh, we've got those.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.984
Then I should have you sign the jacket for me.

39:21.504 --> 39:22.405
Yeah, I've got them all down.

39:22.445 --> 39:23.747
They're not right here in the lily.

39:23.787 --> 39:25.729
I've got them somewhere else.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.913
We'll go to the bank.

39:29.332 --> 39:31.915
Because I just got a locker to put these things in.

39:31.935 --> 39:35.339
They're so big, and you can't really keep them on the shelf with them.

39:35.359 --> 39:39.144
But the Deutsch editions, of course, are normal-sized books, and I've got all of those, too.

39:39.685 --> 39:40.866
Oh, that'd be wonderful, yeah.

39:40.886 --> 39:43.309
And then we have the only signed copies, both of them.

39:44.210 --> 39:47.414
They're all signed by Bowman, because he signs everything.

39:47.434 --> 39:50.017
It's rare to find a copy that he hasn't signed.

39:50.037 --> 39:51.058
He does a lot of signing.

39:51.359 --> 39:53.441
In addition to everything else, he's so energetic.

39:53.481 --> 39:54.823
He signs books like that.

39:54.883 --> 39:56.024
He's in Sacramento now.

39:56.044 --> 39:56.605
Sacramento.

39:57.378 --> 40:03.807
Yeah, he was writing so furiously in New York, and his wife-to-be... Has anybody written anything like that?

40:04.108 --> 40:04.508
What's that?

40:04.528 --> 40:06.872
Has anybody written anything of length in America?

40:06.892 --> 40:11.739
There have been some, a couple of articles about him, because he lives his close-to-death life.

40:11.759 --> 40:17.387
He almost died up in, he went up to the Arctic to write one of his novels, and almost died.

40:17.968 --> 40:23.916
When I saw him, I had breakfast, Linda and I had breakfast with him in San Francisco.

40:23.976 --> 40:26.440
He came in and had friends, he has a number of friends,

40:26.707 --> 40:36.077
introduced me to his wife, and then to a woman he said was his other wife, I don't know exactly what that means, married to a close friend of his who was also there and other people.

40:36.617 --> 40:52.073
And he said he had just come back from, he does things for Spin Magazine and others, had just come back from like a canoeing trip on this river that is so polluted that it's got hydrochloric acid in it, and that if you fall out of your boat,

40:52.508 --> 40:53.769
immediately die.

40:53.889 --> 40:55.951
He said, I made it through safely.

40:56.472 --> 40:59.394
He said, I made it through safely, so I'm all right.

40:59.514 --> 41:01.636
But that's the sort of risks he takes over.

41:01.656 --> 41:05.920
He was interviewing the neo-Nazi survival and stuff in northern Idaho.

41:05.940 --> 41:07.341
I was living in Oregon.

41:07.361 --> 41:12.486
So he'd swing by and either crash on the couch or stay with somebody.

41:12.506 --> 41:18.391
And he was always bringing these very unusual people with him that were kind of traveling companions or something.

41:18.431 --> 41:20.153
They were really edgy.

41:20.740 --> 41:24.546
But I kept thinking, God, you're going up to Hayden Lake.

41:24.566 --> 41:31.717
And somehow he was interviewing the dictator, the guy who was running Madagascar.

41:31.737 --> 41:33.159
That one really scared him, that one.

41:33.179 --> 41:38.427
He thought that any time the guy was just going to turn on him and have him shot.

41:38.447 --> 41:42.494
So I would just send him a postcard every six or eight months and just find out if he's OK.

41:42.874 --> 41:48.503
One of his early books that was fun to read was How I Won the War in Afghanistan.

41:48.719 --> 41:55.165
And I always thought that after the Afghanistan war started and so forth, that they might bring that out again.

41:55.205 --> 42:02.492
He was a journalist, essentially, also, who would go places and write about things.

42:02.512 --> 42:03.593
He was also a programmer.

42:03.613 --> 42:03.714
Yeah.

42:03.734 --> 42:07.177
He lived on candy bars and would write at night.

42:08.198 --> 42:11.401
He didn't have a place to live, so he would sleep under his desk for a few hours.

42:12.122 --> 42:16.366
And he wrote You Bright and Risen Angels while working in Silicon Valley.

42:16.386 --> 42:16.566
Yeah.

42:17.407 --> 42:25.140
And he has terrible carpal tunnel, because he doesn't write 16, 18 hours a day until Janus will pull him off.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.404
He's writing by hand or something else.

42:27.424 --> 42:29.167
I know he really suffers.

42:29.267 --> 42:31.631
It's hard for him just to write for that.

42:31.671 --> 42:41.507
And he's written, I think, now four volumes of his projected seven-volume novels, seven novels on the history of America.

42:41.909 --> 42:44.372
So you did the jacket for one or two of those volumes?

42:44.673 --> 42:47.917
I did one for the Rifles, one for Fathers and Crows.

42:49.218 --> 42:50.981
Did he get the third one out?

42:51.001 --> 42:52.703
I think Deutsch is for it.

42:52.723 --> 42:54.345
Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

42:54.365 --> 42:56.328
I'm not sure about that either.

42:57.069 --> 42:58.991
How did it happen that you did Deutsch?

42:59.011 --> 43:00.513
How do his books do commercially?

43:02.015 --> 43:03.337
I think he has a loyal following.

43:04.318 --> 43:11.427
And I don't often see, I see the American edition's remainder, but he is so...

43:12.335 --> 43:13.958
prolific.

43:13.978 --> 43:22.491
And I think he has a real following amongst all of that sort of 25 to 35 age group that's really interested in .

43:22.511 --> 43:24.074
He is a sort of cult figure.

43:24.114 --> 43:30.745
There's a website that's kept up about him and people who know exactly what he's writing and where and what he's working on.

43:30.785 --> 43:33.189
He has a lot of support that way.

43:33.609 --> 43:37.836
But I was wondering how it came that you did the covers for Deutsch.

43:38.221 --> 43:55.212
Well, Dutch was kind of his pals, and somehow it came up that I should make a drawing, and he was going over, and my ex-wife was English, so when I lived in New York, we'd go over two or three times a year for a while.

43:55.232 --> 43:57.776
She'd go two or three times a year.

43:57.836 --> 43:58.778
He'd go about once a year.

43:58.943 --> 44:02.007
It was just down the street in the British Museum.

44:02.467 --> 44:05.751
It showed up with a drawing, and they said, oh, this is great.

44:05.771 --> 44:06.692
We'll use this.

44:06.712 --> 44:10.397
And I think I was paid 35 pounds for it.

44:10.417 --> 44:14.301
Is that the only dust jacket work you've done, then, or artwork for the books?

44:14.321 --> 44:18.086
I've done a couple of minor things, but basically I just did that as a favor for Bill.

44:18.166 --> 44:19.528
Yeah, sure.

44:19.548 --> 44:22.111
And it was just a trippy thing to do.

44:22.131 --> 44:22.351
Yeah.

44:22.431 --> 44:25.955
You know, go up and turn across the room and see the office of the book.

44:25.975 --> 44:27.297
A little story.

44:28.492 --> 44:45.567
When I was asked to translate Kafka's The Trial, I did a re-translation of The Trial for Schocken, and the way it happened was I was contacted by Fred Jordan, who was then the editor at Schocken and looking to re-translate all of Kafka's work for copyright reasons.

44:46.228 --> 44:49.891
So I was having lunch with him, and it had worked out.

44:49.971 --> 44:56.237
We got along very well, because he'd also been the editor for Samuel Beckett at Grove Press before he came to Schocken.

44:56.453 --> 45:11.839
And because my two great loves of literature have been Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett, the notion that he had edited or was editing both, and we had that in common, made it easy for us to get along, and everything worked out well.

45:12.120 --> 45:20.093
So I said to him, well, now you've been editor, really, both for Beckett and now for reissue of Kafka's work.

45:20.234 --> 45:22.157
Is there any young writer?

45:23.015 --> 45:27.860
that you would say might be a genius, like a Kafka or a Beckett?

45:28.661 --> 45:33.386
And he said, yes, there's a young writer, and this was years ago, of course, William Bowman.

45:33.526 --> 45:34.567
He said he's crazy.

45:34.967 --> 45:37.129
He lives with prostitutes.

45:37.149 --> 45:41.033
He's in drug areas, and he's going to die young.

45:41.153 --> 45:41.634
I know that.

45:41.694 --> 45:44.857
But he said, I think he's got genius.

45:45.378 --> 45:46.499
And I said, well, what has he written?

45:46.519 --> 45:47.940
He said, I'll send you the new book.

45:47.960 --> 45:48.881
It would just come out.

45:49.242 --> 45:51.604
It was Whores for Gloria, that's the name of it.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.081
Horrors for Gloria.

45:53.101 --> 45:54.323
Horrors for Gloria.

45:54.343 --> 45:54.463
Right.

45:54.483 --> 45:56.005
And they were just bringing it out.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.267
He said, I'll send you a copy.

45:57.287 --> 45:58.168
He sent me a copy.

45:58.468 --> 46:00.952
And that was the first thing I read by Bowman.

46:00.972 --> 46:05.718
And I thought it was so different from anything else that I'd read.

46:05.758 --> 46:13.188
It was so different and interesting and repellent in some ways that that got me started in collecting.

46:13.328 --> 46:14.530
Do you agree that it is genius?

46:15.331 --> 46:15.912
Absolutely.

46:16.032 --> 46:16.572
It is genius.

46:16.612 --> 46:17.313
There's no question.

46:17.353 --> 46:19.296
But it's like...

46:19.883 --> 46:30.975
It's like you can read a thousand pages, and there'll be a lot of it that you'll say, you know, almost you'll say, I wish he hadn't written this, almost.

46:31.015 --> 46:32.937
There's too much there.

46:33.017 --> 46:36.661
Then there are passages that are so wonderful that it makes it all worth it.

46:36.701 --> 46:47.393
And there's an overall, an overarching impetus there behind the work that he has that I think is very strong and unique.

46:47.795 --> 46:48.195
in a way.

46:48.336 --> 47:01.588
One of the things, this long thing, I think, in the New York Review of Books that was written about him, basically said, no one else in American literature today is writing like he writes or doing what he does.

47:01.648 --> 47:06.453
He's a person who's totally different than anybody else writing.

47:06.473 --> 47:09.556
He used to, partly, to literature, what Jackson Pollock was to painting.

47:09.576 --> 47:13.920
And even though the paintings, once you got through the initial shock of it,

47:15.149 --> 47:21.497
They were transformative, and that's kind of what I think he's about, is that transformation of attitude.

47:22.198 --> 47:23.960
And he goes where no man will dare go.

47:23.980 --> 47:25.021
Well, here's an example.

47:25.141 --> 47:31.870
When I was with him at breakfast, he said, what do you think I ought to be writing?

47:31.910 --> 47:33.572
You know, you've read my, you know my work.

47:33.612 --> 47:34.493
What should I be doing?

47:35.033 --> 47:38.037
And I said, I love your short stories.

47:38.638 --> 47:41.241
I said, I think you should do more short stories, because I think

47:41.491 --> 47:47.176
When he holds himself into the short story mode, he really comes up and does some great things.

47:47.596 --> 47:52.741
When he gets into the novels, they're big and long and so forth.

47:52.761 --> 47:57.785
So the next thing that came out was not short stories, but this one that's called, I believe, The Royal Family.

47:58.446 --> 48:04.792
But it got the worst reviews you can imagine for a novel because it repelled people.

48:04.872 --> 48:08.415
So it dealt with the prostitutes and a number of prostitutes in San Francisco.

48:08.915 --> 48:10.857
But I read it all the way through.

48:11.815 --> 48:18.124
And I thought that it was a work of real moral courage to write this work.

48:18.345 --> 48:26.457
I thought it was... And the thing he presents, believe it or not, he presents a pedophile.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.763
A man interested in young girls.

48:31.484 --> 48:32.205
Sympathy, though.

48:32.225 --> 48:33.727
With sympathy.

48:33.747 --> 48:39.055
With sympathy in this sense, not with sympathy for pedophilia.

48:40.047 --> 48:43.290
But he creates a human character that you begin to understand.

48:43.510 --> 48:52.219
Somewhat like the film, what is the film that presents also a pedophile, a man with a young boy, and he's made to feel human?

48:52.259 --> 48:53.641
Is it called happiness?

48:53.701 --> 48:54.441
Is that the word?

48:54.462 --> 48:56.464
At any rate, he does this.

48:57.024 --> 49:03.391
His characters in there are all characters for whom he has compassion.

49:04.111 --> 49:06.734
And at the end, that's why I would say moral courage.

49:06.814 --> 49:08.856
My feeling is at the end, he's saying,

49:09.848 --> 49:21.358
We all say something like, you know, Christ would say, everyone come to me, or, you know, open up and compassion everyone, but nobody really is that way.

49:21.478 --> 49:23.100
But in fact, we should be that way.

49:23.600 --> 49:28.205
We should be open and compassionate and understanding to everyone.

49:28.225 --> 49:37.733
And, boy, if you take that far enough, that means being open and compassionate and understanding to some pretty questionable characters, and that's the problem.

49:37.953 --> 49:38.674
He showed up.

49:39.160 --> 49:41.243
At my apartment one day, I had done something for him.

49:42.445 --> 49:49.898
He said, I want to give you something for the help of, you know, art material for 10 years, whatever it was, didn't matter.

49:49.918 --> 49:57.190
And he had a portfolio of these gigantic Jacques Sturgis photographs that were going to be used in Horace or Laurie or one of the projects.

49:57.210 --> 49:58.793
And he said, I want you to pick one of these.

49:59.334 --> 50:04.442
Well, we covered the table with these things, and they were just amazing photographs.

50:05.671 --> 50:08.636
You could just see the plight of these women.

50:08.656 --> 50:13.243
Every photograph had a story, and Bill was there when the photographs were taken, so he knew the name of this woman.

50:13.564 --> 50:15.407
He forgot the name of this woman.

50:15.427 --> 50:22.078
They were all very young, and they were looking at documents about white slavery or something.

50:22.098 --> 50:27.406
And I finally said, I'll take one of these, but I can't hang this.

50:27.426 --> 50:28.668
I don't know how to live with this.

50:28.989 --> 50:32.775
It'll go into my file with other prints.

50:33.312 --> 50:35.595
And I'm not even sure how to react.

50:36.155 --> 50:38.558
I don't know whether I'm grateful or what.

50:38.618 --> 50:47.349
I knew that Sturgis was a really fine photographer, and I better not not do this, because this is probably going to be the least worth some money.

50:47.369 --> 50:54.477
But it was a very difficult afternoon to embrace that huge compassion that this crazy man has.

50:54.617 --> 50:56.139
How did you meet him?

50:56.159 --> 51:00.604
He called me on the phone and said that he'd run into somebody that knew me, and he had a book to show me.

51:00.624 --> 51:02.847
And this was this giant steel book.

51:03.147 --> 51:28.095
and I ran into a lot of interesting, strange people in New York, and Bill was right up there with the top of the line, and I just felt that this guy's got something, because he reminds me of a kid that he'd run into at a gas station and ask directions from, and he kind of had this slow... He really seems autistic, is what you tend to think.

51:28.115 --> 51:30.118
He just seems kind of like a god present.

51:30.138 --> 51:32.260
There's something there you think,

51:32.847 --> 51:34.409
He's just not right.

51:34.609 --> 51:36.171
There's something wrong there.

51:36.331 --> 51:38.794
But it's not clear what it is that's not quite right.

51:38.814 --> 51:46.502
In his young life, he had traveled more in the last few years than I've traveled in my life.

51:46.523 --> 51:49.145
And then he would go to the Arctic.

51:49.166 --> 51:51.969
He did a reading at Granary Books one night.

51:51.989 --> 51:57.395
And he had just, two days before, come back from a different one.

51:57.415 --> 52:01.960
And he basically told us that in this village, he brought this woman with him.

52:02.345 --> 52:06.431
who was just psychotic, and he could barely keep her under control.

52:06.451 --> 52:11.900
And he said, well, yeah, you have to kind of forgive whatever her name was.

52:11.920 --> 52:19.552
All the kids had giant parkas, and they just sniff glue and solvents all day long to stay high.

52:19.572 --> 52:25.822
But their existence is so terrible that if they sober up, they're just crazed.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.386
So he brings this woman to New York.

52:29.902 --> 52:32.905
Boy, she was just astonishing.

52:32.925 --> 52:33.947
She was just a hand case.

52:33.967 --> 52:35.648
Is his work energized by substances?

52:36.109 --> 52:37.511
I don't think so.

52:39.152 --> 52:39.713
But I don't know.

52:39.753 --> 52:45.499
I found Bill so interesting, but I also knew that we'd hang out well.

52:45.519 --> 52:51.146
We'd go to a Korean restaurant and share meals, and it was just kind of like a family outing.

52:51.166 --> 52:54.009
And I never detected any drug use.

52:54.189 --> 52:57.613
His wife was a physician, and I don't think she'd put up with it.

52:57.880 --> 53:02.687
But she was concerned about his health and the trend of regulations.

53:02.707 --> 53:06.834
Yeah, he does write about extreme situations.

53:06.854 --> 53:11.120
I'm trying to think whether there's any description of where he actually is taking drugs himself.

53:11.140 --> 53:15.387
But he certainly writes about characters who have sex regularly with prostitutes.

53:16.068 --> 53:17.831
And no doubt that's him, too.

53:18.271 --> 53:24.220
And specifically without protection from time to time.

53:24.781 --> 53:25.963
And I don't know what that is.

53:26.281 --> 53:29.646
I don't know what the line is there between fiction and reality.

53:29.746 --> 53:30.907
Obviously, he's still alive.

53:31.108 --> 53:32.890
So does the guy shoot craps with the fates?

53:32.970 --> 53:35.313
I mean, is it every day?

53:36.635 --> 53:42.664
People tend to think that he has this tendency toward self-destruction.

53:42.744 --> 53:49.653
The thing you can read about is that when he was young, and I'm not sure whether he was actually here.

53:49.673 --> 53:51.195
It didn't happen here in Bloomington.

53:51.576 --> 53:53.098
When he was even younger than that,

53:53.500 --> 54:02.351
He was supposed to be watching his younger sister, and she got in the swimming pool and drowned, and he felt responsible for that.

54:02.531 --> 54:05.875
And for the rest of his life, he seems to have two things.

54:06.676 --> 54:16.909
One, a desire to help young girls save prostitutes, save women who are lost, and the other for sort of a self-lacerating

54:17.328 --> 54:24.160
guilt that he really doesn't deserve to be alive, and he'll just put himself in harm's way and see what happens.

54:24.180 --> 54:26.304
This is one interpretation.

54:26.685 --> 54:28.368
I don't think that.

54:28.608 --> 54:29.390
I don't think that.

54:30.953 --> 54:33.698
Yeah, I think it's the relationship with his sister.

54:33.718 --> 54:34.840
So you didn't know about the sister?

54:34.880 --> 54:36.362
I didn't know.

54:36.382 --> 54:39.488
He doesn't talk about it, but he writes about it, and his

54:39.738 --> 54:43.903
When he brought this young woman to New York, that sounds very much like a savior idea.

54:43.923 --> 54:46.085
Yeah, it's to save the girl.

54:49.689 --> 55:05.307
But he's the only person who is recording, with any depth or honesty at all, with real depth, the life of the underclass, the downtrodden, the drug addicts, the prostitutes,

55:05.978 --> 55:32.340
everywhere and all around the world and he also told me that he has a collection of thousands of photographs of prostitutes and and the down and out that he has shot or he's collected i think he's shot most of them and he asked me what what should be done with what i thought should be done and i said i think they should be preserved who else has done this uh on the other hand a place like the lily library is probably not the best place but

55:32.624 --> 55:33.686
Kinsey is possible.

55:33.786 --> 55:38.534
Also, of course, the Library of Congress is collecting these sorts of materials, too.

55:38.974 --> 55:39.635
So he's got it.

55:39.675 --> 55:46.286
He said a lot of them may be on, you know, silver prints or things that there may be problems with preservation and stories.

55:46.346 --> 55:52.356
Well, he did a book on prostitutes, the earliest photographs of prostitutes I've seen from New Orleans.

55:52.376 --> 55:53.217
Yeah.

55:53.238 --> 55:55.661
So at any rate, he does, I think, has a big collection.

55:56.242 --> 55:59.087
But he's so—can you imagine everything he's doing?

56:00.097 --> 56:04.063
Do you think a writer like this, his impact remains to be measured?

56:04.083 --> 56:05.966
I mean, this is something long after he's gone.

56:05.986 --> 56:08.950
I think we're going to have to wait another 20 years.

56:09.511 --> 56:09.872
You think?

56:09.892 --> 56:11.675
This is one of these sleeper writers, right?

56:12.376 --> 56:15.140
Well, actually, maybe he hasn't even found his form yet.

56:15.300 --> 56:17.824
And his form or his audience, perhaps.

56:17.844 --> 56:18.365
Or his audience.

56:18.565 --> 56:19.747
And the thing, you know, yeah.

56:19.987 --> 56:22.190
Well, I mean, it's 25 to 35 years.

56:22.631 --> 56:23.893
He's got an audience.

56:23.933 --> 56:28.500
I think that his, you know, it'll be years before his place in American

56:28.649 --> 56:55.483
But one thing as a collector that I've done, which I think is one valuable role that collectors can have, is in recognizing and thinking somebody is important that way, I realize that these limited editions, just not only are they not being collected, really, I mean, it's just too hard to get to them.

56:55.868 --> 56:57.350
But they're not even being created.

56:57.390 --> 56:59.513
I mean, an edition of ten copies.

57:00.233 --> 57:01.735
He's done three copies.

57:01.775 --> 57:02.516
I have one.

57:02.556 --> 57:03.898
These other two went to process.

57:04.098 --> 57:05.340
He hasn't done any more copies.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.101
When would he do it?

57:06.161 --> 57:07.482
When would he have copies?

57:07.523 --> 57:20.779
He comes up with so many ideas, and he started to realize that the last time we talked about this was probably before I moved, so probably five years ago, six years ago, and he was coming to terms with the fact that making

57:21.198 --> 57:26.025
a unique book or a small edition, which is just a mountain of work.

57:26.486 --> 57:29.811
And it doesn't pay off financially for him in any significant way.

57:30.071 --> 57:37.662
It probably will when that start of his is really up there.

57:38.002 --> 57:44.852
What I have then is a complete collection of all of these limited editions, of every one of them together.

57:45.333 --> 57:46.735
So that'll be here at the Lilly.

57:46.755 --> 57:50.040
But I don't think there'll be a similar collection anywhere in the world, because

57:50.965 --> 57:54.129
unless he gets back into making the books.

57:54.149 --> 58:00.437
And it's a really hard thing to go back and make a fourth copy of a book that you did 20 years ago.

58:00.837 --> 58:02.459
You don't have the same paper.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.602
You don't have the same energy.

58:04.682 --> 58:07.586
Well, do you think he'd be tempted to change it as he's going along, too?

58:07.786 --> 58:11.130
I mean, do you think it's going to be a copy of the book that he did 20 years earlier?

58:11.231 --> 58:12.072
That's totally true.

58:12.372 --> 58:13.193
Yeah.

58:13.409 --> 58:14.631
I don't think he would do it.

58:14.651 --> 58:30.458
I would say it's going to be like leaves and grass, you know, across the field changing from when... You see, even at the time he did that extra copy or unique copy of Convict Bird for me, I think if somebody asked him to do that now, he probably wouldn't go back and do it now.

58:30.478 --> 58:31.801
He's doing too many other things.

58:31.821 --> 58:32.281
Or to change it.

58:32.341 --> 58:32.942
He's passing it.

58:32.962 --> 58:33.403
He'd be right.

58:33.483 --> 58:35.467
I mean, that book represents another time.

58:35.487 --> 58:37.530
I just don't think he would return to it now.

58:37.590 --> 58:39.113
I think there's too much going on.

58:39.987 --> 58:40.868
in his life.

58:41.049 --> 58:41.710
I don't know.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.192
No, I think that's true.

58:43.292 --> 58:44.294
I was asked to do it.

58:44.314 --> 58:47.038
I was going to say, what if someone came to you and said, we do?

58:47.058 --> 58:51.986
Somebody wanted to buy the original flight into Egypt, and I don't want to sell it at this point.

58:52.046 --> 58:56.252
So I said, well, I'll make you one, because those themes are still alive.

58:56.272 --> 59:00.559
But it's not going to look anything like it.

59:00.699 --> 59:03.424
I don't even know what it would look like, but let me go and work on this.

59:03.444 --> 59:06.088
It turned out to be an entirely different book.

59:06.108 --> 59:06.248
Yeah.

59:06.481 --> 59:14.111
with just an evocation of some Egyptian esoteric... Still very, very interesting, though, to be able to compare the two.

59:14.131 --> 59:16.915
And it was an interesting exercise, because I'd never done it.

59:16.935 --> 59:25.466
But I could certainly see where, as I was working on it, I felt like that's a really good idea, but I've exhausted it.

59:25.766 --> 59:30.092
I no longer have a taste for that kind of fried food anymore.

59:31.169 --> 59:37.497
Well, what I liked about the convict bird thing was that the first one had been black and white and the second one color.

59:37.837 --> 59:41.522
That's an interesting thing when an author thinks, OK, I've done it black and white.

59:41.542 --> 59:43.124
I mean, what would it be like in color?

59:43.545 --> 59:45.207
Oh, the technology is all different?

59:45.227 --> 59:46.829
I have a whole chapter.

59:46.869 --> 59:51.435
I've got to read this chapter in my book about when is completed work completed work?

59:51.975 --> 59:56.942
Should Wordsworth have gone back to rewrite the poems of his youth, you know, disastrously?

59:56.962 --> 59:59.725
Is there any answer?

01:00:00.177 --> 01:00:01.519
Yeah, you shouldn't.

01:00:01.539 --> 01:00:02.680
You should leave it alone.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.087
I've always either asked, how do you know when the drawing is done, or how do you know when the book is done?

01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:10.992
A published work should speak for that person you are.

01:00:11.132 --> 01:00:12.674
That's my view.

01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:13.736
Yeah.

01:00:13.756 --> 01:00:22.388
I know somebody like Bill Kennedy, William Kennedy, when The Ink Truck was his first book, and then he hits it with ironweed.

01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:22.648
Ironweed.

01:00:22.668 --> 01:00:28.917
And so then people say, well, maybe, he said, that book had so many flaws, and the temptation is to go back and make it right.

01:00:28.957 --> 01:00:29.998
But he said, that book was

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.084
The person I was when I wrote it, and you'll leave it.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:41.313
But there are the people who, Henry James, when he was doing the New York edition, I mean, he was writing the prefaces while he started redoing the books.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.114
I mean, isn't that right?

01:00:42.694 --> 01:00:45.598
Henry James was famous for rewriting them.

01:00:45.618 --> 01:00:49.843
That's why I keep thinking we all need, like, a foreman to make sure that we don't go back and do something.

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:50.624
Oh, that one's done.

01:00:50.664 --> 01:00:51.825
You just leave it.

01:00:51.845 --> 01:01:00.576
I have in mind Tim O'Brien, when he was, he told me, and I've got it in my book, that he was, they were bringing out a paperback edition of Going After Cacciato people.

01:01:00.995 --> 01:01:02.717
I said, well, I've got to fix this stuff up.

01:01:02.737 --> 01:01:08.945
There are things here that... And he got a call from a professor and said, you know, we're reading your book in class.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.548
And he said, I've got the hardcover and the kids have the paperback.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:12.970
And he said, we're reading two different books.

01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:16.114
I said, you know, is that a good idea?

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:22.041
Another... It's a thing that as a literary translator, I face all the time.

01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:24.515
When are you finished with the translation?

01:01:24.535 --> 01:01:25.377
It's a little different.

01:01:25.397 --> 01:01:32.991
And it's amazingly hard, once a book has been published, to get a publisher to let you correct some, even if they're simple errors.

01:01:33.172 --> 01:01:38.582
I know in the Kafka there are about four or five things that I knew even before it came out.

01:01:39.203 --> 01:01:40.726
I tried to correct on the proofs.

01:01:40.766 --> 01:01:41.768
They didn't get through.

01:01:42.203 --> 01:01:43.225
And I've written and written.

01:01:43.245 --> 01:01:44.547
It's in the eighth printing now.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.191
It's sold maybe 100,000 copies.

01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:53.160
They say they'll put it in a file and they'll do it in the next printing, but they never do it because it's extra money.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.623
They're selling it fine.

01:01:54.703 --> 01:01:58.148
Why should they take the time to go back and reprint?

01:01:58.168 --> 01:01:58.809
I have mistakes.

01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:01.233
I drive them crazy.

01:02:01.373 --> 01:02:04.658
Well, I haven't been able to drive them crazy enough yet.

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.603
Next time I'm in New York, I will ask to meet.

01:02:07.988 --> 01:02:13.716
with the woman who's now the editor and just say, look, you know, you've gone through eight... It's not hard.

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:14.978
It's all computers now.

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:27.014
Nobody's caught these yet, but when somebody says to me, why didn't you do this on page so-and-so, I am going to be able to show them a letter before the first edition came out where I asked if that be corrected.

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:29.557
And you're the guy who's going to take the hit.

01:02:29.718 --> 01:02:33.743
I preserve this all here at the Lilly and my Kafka papers.

01:02:34.145 --> 01:02:36.248
protect myself for the future.

01:02:36.648 --> 01:02:41.895
But it's really interesting how an error gets accepted.

01:02:41.935 --> 01:02:48.003
It works its way into the body of work, and then for just a commercial reason or neglect, it stays.

01:02:48.183 --> 01:03:01.039
And so something, whatever, I can give you a decent example, but I have cookbooks that eggs are left out of this dumpling recipe, and it will not work without that.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.342
And yet, you know, it's a fanny farmer in the

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:06.615
definition, and it's still wrong.

01:03:08.497 --> 01:03:11.260
What does nobody cook?

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.423
History repeats itself, but historians repeat one another.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:19.788
Once the mistake is there, it's there, and it just keeps replicating itself.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.591
It's almost impossible.

01:03:22.611 --> 01:03:28.056
People will quote you, thank goodness it hasn't happened to me, but if you've got an error, and somebody keeps repeating the error.

01:03:28.076 --> 01:03:32.400
Because they cite, well, it was in this guy's book, and

01:03:32.785 --> 01:03:56.464
I don't know how many book-finding books I have that will all, it's almost as if they were written by the same, there was a vertex somewhere, and everybody just will all do my version, and they're all perpetuating the same horrible practice, with no thought to, let's test this, let's do something, it's just so, the literature trickles down, and then it's kind of looked up to our generation to sort it out at all.

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.715
no, this is not what you want to do here.

01:03:59.677 --> 01:04:10.136
It's been a long, of course, it's in commercial bindings, I'm thinking that, but what a long tradition there have been of books that cannot be read without destroying the binding.

01:04:10.397 --> 01:04:15.947
I mean, it's just impossible to read many books without destroying the binding.

01:04:15.967 --> 01:04:20.475
And the great irony is there are so many bookbinding books that you can't open.

01:04:20.495 --> 01:04:20.595
Yeah.

01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:26.329
There's information tucked down in the gutter, and it's just, Philip's book is just a beautiful example.

01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:28.412
It's printed grain wrong.

01:04:28.512 --> 01:04:44.816
So here's this book that originally was probably $35, and my reading copy is just a mess, and I had to buy another copy just so I could keep this thing largely intact, and I'm going to have to fix this thing someday.

01:04:45.818 --> 01:04:49.283
It's on that Paul Bonet binding that's on that beautiful Schmid book.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:53.194
It opens about like this, and it's fantastic prints inside it.

01:04:53.694 --> 01:04:54.635
You just can't see.

01:04:54.735 --> 01:04:58.019
The binding's beautiful as a rock, but not as a book.

01:04:58.039 --> 01:04:59.781
It doesn't function as a book at all.

01:04:59.921 --> 01:05:02.263
I know all these great stories.

01:05:02.924 --> 01:05:07.449
I mean, Pauly, a lot of Makarski complained to Monet that his books didn't open.

01:05:07.469 --> 01:05:10.832
And he said, well, I'll speak to my binder about this.

01:05:10.852 --> 01:05:12.975
And, of course, nothing changed.

01:05:13.195 --> 01:05:18.240
And somebody else complained, and he said, well, this book, you know,

01:05:18.676 --> 01:05:22.440
Well, you've obviously been reading this.

01:05:23.701 --> 01:05:25.463
Why would you want to open it anyway?

01:05:25.563 --> 01:05:33.470
Well, okay, so we buy this $40,000 binding, and then we buy the Pantheon edition to read.

01:05:33.951 --> 01:05:41.178
Let me ask you a question about the covers of these books, because they're so beautiful, and I hesitated to touch it.

01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:45.342
I want to make sure my hands were clean, and I see that you've put the notebook on top of that one.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:51.450
How worried are you about the fragility of the covers in terms of something happening?

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:51.971
I'm worried.

01:05:51.991 --> 01:05:54.174
We don't go up and rub paintings, but we touch books.

01:05:54.214 --> 01:05:55.195
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:55.215 --> 01:06:03.106
So these are, the paper is, I resize the paper, I coat it, the painting drawing is done.

01:06:03.587 --> 01:06:15.143
When it's had days to cure, I install the painting on the board, counterwork the backside so it's flat, and then before I install the boards, they're given a coat of ketone varnish.

01:06:15.443 --> 01:06:28.534
And then I wax that, and over the course of the next policy, this is probably by June, I'll have put maybe six, eight coats of paste wax on and work that in.

01:06:28.574 --> 01:06:31.016
So it'll lose some of this on both of these.

01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:34.139
You're still, because you haven't made the boxes yet, those are still in progress.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:37.562
But they're absolutely, you could put a coffee cup on this.

01:06:37.582 --> 01:06:38.422
I was going to say.

01:06:38.442 --> 01:06:42.185
And they function as coasters.

01:06:42.225 --> 01:06:43.146
See, is that nice?

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:45.248
They're user-friendly.

01:06:45.532 --> 01:06:49.517
The more encrusted books are bulletproof.

01:06:49.537 --> 01:06:55.984
The resins tend to get harder because of their main mixes of sand and soil and eggshell.

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:59.828
They become like body armor.

01:06:59.848 --> 01:07:01.270
I like that in the book.

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:02.812
They have to work as reading machines.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:09.379
They have to work so when Jim goes to exhibit something that it can lay open for whoever on the show is

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:31.180
And any book that won't do that, I think is, I have made books that don't open well, and the master binders that I show them to, one time I showed a book to Philip, and he said, oh, this is very French, and he wouldn't open it any further, and this is, well, it will open, it's a tight back, so, you know, you should use some caution.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.548
And I went, well, I really like binding it that way, because of this,

01:07:36.832 --> 01:07:40.218
long-held tradition that's so wonderful, and yet it makes sense.

01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:49.795
So there's this ongoing conflict of, do we do it this way because it's just really wonderful for gold tooling, or are we going to do it that way because it opens?

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:54.944
And I don't think before World War II, openability was an issue.

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:59.111
I can find nothing in the literature that says it's important that it won't work.

01:08:00.073 --> 01:08:01.776
It says it's important that they be well-bound.

01:08:02.009 --> 01:08:19.039
I remember years and years ago an exhibition I was at in Paris of when book objects were just beginning to be seen, and of course, yeah, and that was the word they used, the book object, and of course, those are books.

01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:23.585
which not only can't be opened, but are never meant to be opened, not to be read.

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:27.151
They're simply pieces of sculpture that are inspired or related to it.

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.896
There's a couple in Miami who I wrote very briefly.

01:08:29.937 --> 01:08:30.698
I've been from home.

01:08:30.778 --> 01:08:33.142
I wrote about them very briefly in one of my books.

01:08:33.163 --> 01:08:37.230
These people are 65,000, and it's just the houses.

01:08:37.615 --> 01:08:40.118
engulfed with all of these books as objects.

01:08:40.258 --> 01:08:43.322
They call it concrete, a concrete and visual poetry collection.

01:08:43.342 --> 01:08:44.163
Yeah, that's right.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:53.133
We have a very large collection of concrete poetry here from Mary Ellen Solt, who was a major person in the field, and so we'd have to note that that was too.

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:58.780
I think that their collection is now either in a museum or is it placed somewhere.

01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:00.932
Well, I started two years ago at home.

01:09:01.132 --> 01:09:01.813
It's still there.

01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:02.994
They're trying to place it.

01:09:03.114 --> 01:09:03.535
That's it.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:04.676
They're trying to place it.

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:06.197
But it's such a huge collection.

01:09:06.217 --> 01:09:15.227
It's so valuable that, you know, the only thing that they could really do is either sell it at auction or donate it to the place.

01:09:15.247 --> 01:09:16.408
They're a lot of fun.

01:09:16.628 --> 01:09:18.330
They really are a hoop, those two of them.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:25.117
We went out to dinner, and they came to, I was at the Miami Book Fair, and they came, and they introduced themselves right after the time.

01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:25.898
What are you doing tonight?

01:09:26.215 --> 01:09:27.336
Oh, that's them.

01:09:27.837 --> 01:09:29.478
I said, well, let's go.

01:09:30.259 --> 01:09:32.421
And I just said, jeez, I wish my wife were here to see this.

01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:34.924
This was really, really something.

01:09:34.944 --> 01:09:41.570
I mean, they lie down on the floor, you know, to be part of this book arrangement.

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:48.597
I said, I remember one line, and they loved it, and I said, do you actually, does anybody read these books?

01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:53.202
I mean, what do you do with these things besides view them?

01:09:53.519 --> 01:09:56.962
They thought that was hysterical that someone had actually asked that question.

01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:02.608
I thought they were talking concrete poetry like it was, you know, as opposed to abstract poetry.

01:10:02.628 --> 01:10:06.652
I didn't realize that they were using that description in a literal sense.

01:10:07.053 --> 01:10:08.954
Well, just the same way you were collecting dictionaries.

01:10:08.995 --> 01:10:14.300
Martin was collecting concrete poetry and Russian constructivist material that nobody cared.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.902
And he could pick these books up for just peanuts.

01:10:17.303 --> 01:10:18.684
And all of a sudden, it caught on.

01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:21.467
And so then he switched.

01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:24.814
I think early artist books.

01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:30.423
And I probably met him in 82 or 83 when they were just getting that collection going.

01:10:31.284 --> 01:10:37.354
And until he stopped collecting, he was buying one or two books a year.

01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:41.019
And the last one was a pretty big book.

01:10:41.039 --> 01:10:42.982
And I called him up and said, it's finished.

01:10:43.003 --> 01:10:43.864
I'm ready to deliver it.

01:10:44.585 --> 01:10:45.867
And how should I send it?

01:10:45.967 --> 01:10:47.610
And he said, well, I buy you an airplane ticket.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:48.451
You bring it down.

01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:50.374
I'll put you up in an art deco hotel.

01:10:50.894 --> 01:10:52.636
and go ahead and I'll show you the collection.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:55.699
And it was just a staggering three days.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.165
And the kids are all gone, so all the bedrooms are just full of flat files.

01:11:00.225 --> 01:11:04.309
And you open it up in one drawer, and it's full of John Furnable drawings.

01:11:04.409 --> 01:11:06.812
And I only went through one drawer.

01:11:06.832 --> 01:11:10.336
And all the time I was there, I didn't even go to the second floor and go out.

01:11:10.356 --> 01:11:11.177
Oh, too much.

01:11:11.357 --> 01:11:13.780
I went downstairs and went back to the Furnable drawer.

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.509
thought, oh, this is impossible.

01:11:16.529 --> 01:11:18.252
I met the, I gave a paper.

01:11:18.272 --> 01:11:33.141
We were together at a conference at the Getty, where on the history of the book, where I gave a paper, and they were there talking also about collectors, collectors, bookmakers, and supposed academics about the book, and talked with them about the collection.

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.245
And it turned out I actually had a book

01:11:36.237 --> 01:11:39.160
that they didn't have that I was able to give them.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:47.527
So I feel like I've contributed in a small way to their collection anyway.

01:11:47.547 --> 01:11:49.549
Shaped poetry is another way to look at it.

01:11:49.569 --> 01:11:52.811
Then you don't run into this problem with concrete versus abstract.

01:11:53.312 --> 01:12:04.962
A lot of it is shaped poetry, although when they... But it gives you more an idea of what they're interested in, really, is the notion of text as somehow having a

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:07.974
a concrete shape to them, a form.

01:12:08.955 --> 01:12:10.577
But it goes way beyond that.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:14.242
Because you wouldn't call your work concrete.

01:12:14.262 --> 01:12:15.304
No.

01:12:15.484 --> 01:12:17.146
Martin was just so compelled by it.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.389
Yeah, he just liked it.

01:12:19.409 --> 01:12:21.772
And I don't even know how it fits in the collection.

01:12:21.792 --> 01:12:22.373
Well, it's a book.

01:12:22.593 --> 01:12:23.114
Yeah.

01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:26.218
And maybe that's the starting point.

01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:29.222
He invents medical devices to support his collecting.

01:12:29.302 --> 01:12:35.050
Yeah, he developed amazing chicken soup machines and heart surgery.

01:12:35.705 --> 01:13:02.813
The man who's the richest man in Indiana, and is here from Bloomington, has given a great deal of money to our library, Bill Cook, also invented a medical device, a stint that goes into the heart, and started in his garage here with a $2,000 loan years and years ago, and he's now in, you know, he's the richest man in Indiana, but also one of the top 400 richest men in the world, all from that new invention.

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:04.294
I could probably redesign the top.

01:13:05.405 --> 01:13:07.868
to make it better and palatable.

01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:09.709
I think you've got an idea.

01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:12.452
I think I've got a really good idea.

01:13:12.572 --> 01:13:19.319
We'll just keep it amongst the forums at the end.

01:13:19.459 --> 01:13:21.862
Well, yeah, you've probably got time.

01:13:22.302 --> 01:13:24.805
You'll have lunch eventually and so forth.

01:13:24.825 --> 01:13:25.586
I'm going to go down.

01:13:25.626 --> 01:13:31.632
There's supposed to be someone floating around that is a

01:13:32.017 --> 01:13:33.920
a potential donor.

01:13:34.941 --> 01:13:39.408
Well, I'm just going to see where he is floating at the moment.

01:13:40.089 --> 01:13:41.031
I haven't met him.

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.835
I know he's in town and he wanted to come by.

01:13:44.316 --> 01:13:46.479
So I'd better check my office and see.

01:13:46.899 --> 01:13:51.206
And then, if you wanted to talk more, but this is business.

01:13:51.246 --> 01:13:53.389
How can I get in touch with you?

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:55.072
I'm going to see if I have a card.

01:13:55.092 --> 01:13:56.955
If I don't, I'll write everything down.

01:13:57.055 --> 01:13:57.836
Okay, good.

01:13:57.856 --> 01:13:58.497
All those things.

01:13:58.949 --> 01:14:03.394
I'm going to run down now, and then if you want to talk later, we can talk more.

01:14:03.494 --> 01:14:05.255
Thank you.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:13.003
If we can't do it today, maybe we can... What is this one that we're looking at?

01:14:13.043 --> 01:14:18.829
Well, there's another map that just shows some of the different dialects, both in a very colorful one.

01:14:18.849 --> 01:14:27.218
But sometimes there'll be a printed language, and it'll be just with a specimen, like this is behind as it happens.

01:14:27.502 --> 01:14:31.150
And how many languages do you, are you able to...?

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:32.813
Well, I'm limited.

01:14:33.194 --> 01:14:40.009
I do French, German, and English for my languages, and I've studied, you know, enough that I can read other languages.

01:14:40.029 --> 01:14:42.835
So these are largely books, for the most part, that you can't read?

01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:48.126
Well, I have, as I mentioned, over 550 different languages.

01:14:48.545 --> 01:14:55.697
And so you can expect that there's probably about 540 of them that I can't do my job.

01:14:55.717 --> 01:14:58.141
But that's irrelevant to the purpose of what you're doing.

01:14:58.301 --> 01:15:06.736
Actually, once you get into it, as you know, once you get into it, you learn, you begin to recognize things.

01:15:06.756 --> 01:15:13.607
For instance, I know the word dictionary and vocabulary and other things.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.141
in many, many, many different languages.

01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:25.294
And I can often recognize, because of the vocabulary, the same sorts of things that are being said about various languages.

01:15:25.314 --> 01:15:34.367
You got into a little bit of this upstairs, but how again is it that you got into this collection of lexicons and dictionaries?

01:15:34.427 --> 01:15:35.669
Yes.

01:15:35.749 --> 01:15:40.135
I had finished my collection of Franz Kafka and purchased the last

01:15:40.418 --> 01:15:50.349
item that I didn't have, which was the first edition of his first book, and I got a copy that was a presentation copy from Kafka to Franz Werfel, and I was finished.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:16:07.928
And when I finished, and actually I mentioned I sold that collection, and that's the one that the lame duck catalog was done of, and I was just bereft, wanting to collect, and really feeling at a loss, and then I said I would start

01:16:08.296 --> 01:16:14.042
a new collection, and the idea I had was just to get one dictionary for each language in the world.

01:16:14.523 --> 01:16:19.468
And that's when I talked to my wife and told her that's what I wanted to do, and she said, would they be little?

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.150
I said, oh yeah, pocket dictionaries.

01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:35.586
But once, as soon as I got into it, I found out and thought it'd be obviously much more interesting to collect the first dictionary of each language in the world, which would almost always, and was in every case, be a bilingual dictionary.

01:16:36.022 --> 01:16:41.770
early on with Latin, but often then with either English or French or Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch.

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:49.681
And so I had to be able to deal with those languages enough to recognize what was happening, but many other languages as well.

01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:52.445
Was there a utility for you, being a translator?

01:16:52.926 --> 01:16:53.186
Yes.

01:16:53.266 --> 01:17:02.940
In fact, because I translate from the German, I'm a literary translator from the German, I had built up German-English dictionaries, a specialized collection of my own.

01:17:03.258 --> 01:17:15.709
for translation purposes, for instance, a dictionary that would be specialized in dental terms, or a dictionary about sailing German English, or a confectionary's dictionary, and so forth.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:31.763
And I bought dictionaries from different periods, so I have a dictionary, German English, 1780, 1800, 1830, 1840, 1889, 1900, 1910, the 30s,

01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:34.727
during the Nazi period and then modern dictionaries.

01:17:34.747 --> 01:17:58.864
And if I translated a text like Kafka that was written around 1910 to 1915, I would turn to a dictionary that was published at that time, including a dictionary of business terms or legal terms.

01:17:59.553 --> 01:18:03.738
Well, how did you come to translation as a professional exercise?

01:18:03.758 --> 01:18:06.321
Oh, that was just out of love, actually.

01:18:06.361 --> 01:18:17.235
When I was an undergraduate at the University of Kansas, I started translating for fun, just learning language, and I thought it would be fun to translate short stories or poetry.

01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:27.788
And a friend and I actually translated a full-length verse drama by Hugo von Hofmannsthal called Death and the Fool into blank verse, just

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:32.610
did it for fun because we were both just learning German, no German in our background.

01:18:33.131 --> 01:18:38.278
So we started a literary magazine there that was a bilingual German-English literary magazine.

01:18:38.298 --> 01:18:44.367
It was called Persuch, B-E-R-S-U-C-H, Attempt or Trial.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:50.375
And we actually wrote around other universities in the area and had people contribute to it.

01:18:50.936 --> 01:18:55.362
So we put out actually two issues a year of that.

01:18:55.983 --> 01:18:58.346
How long did you do it?

01:18:58.806 --> 01:19:03.232
I did it for the three years from the time I was a sophomore, for three years.

01:19:03.532 --> 01:19:05.475
But it continued at least for 20 years.

01:19:05.595 --> 01:19:13.685
I mean, the thing continued on and on, because they wrote to me, I think, on the 25th anniversary and said that they were doing that.

01:19:13.745 --> 01:19:25.399
I also, in the meantime, ran into, later in life, one or two people who were professors in my area who had published in it from other institutions around, and so that was sort of fun.

01:19:26.105 --> 01:19:39.847
So when I went to graduate school, I went to philosophy at Oxford, but I was also studying German, and I wound up doing comparative literature and writing on James Joyce's Ulysses and its impact on the German novel.

01:19:40.549 --> 01:19:43.954
So the translation side was a little quiescent there.

01:19:44.094 --> 01:19:50.124
But when I came back here, when I came here and started teaching, and I was... In 1968?

01:19:50.144 --> 01:19:51.927
In 1968.

01:19:52.143 --> 01:19:56.047
I think when I arrived, I just turned 26 at that time.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:58.909
And you've been a lifelong bibliophile.

01:19:58.989 --> 01:20:03.254
I've been collecting since I was about 14 years old.

01:20:04.595 --> 01:20:10.380
And so when I've been at Oxford, I've been going to those auctions and going to the bookhouses and so forth.

01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:19.028
Came back here and just reading widely found a text, some text that I really liked by a German author named Rudiger Kramer.

01:20:19.589 --> 01:20:21.711
And I just thought I'd translate them for fun.

01:20:22.433 --> 01:20:27.180
Got started actually by, after that, I met Jay Lachlan of New Directions.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.484
He came out here to Indiana University.

01:20:30.504 --> 01:20:31.265
I would have loved to.

01:20:31.485 --> 01:20:33.208
Yeah, it's a wonderful, wonderful person.

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:34.930
He didn't do anything.

01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:42.741
And he said, you know, we were at a cocktail party after his talk, and he said, what about German literature, anything you're interested in?

01:20:42.761 --> 01:20:45.725
And he said, I'd like to publish some more German.

01:20:45.745 --> 01:20:47.968
He said, we published a novel by...

01:20:48.488 --> 01:20:52.011
by Martin Balzer, but he said it got pretty good reviews, but nobody bought it.

01:20:52.172 --> 01:20:54.734
And, you know, I like German.

01:20:54.754 --> 01:20:55.675
I want to do more German.

01:20:55.715 --> 01:20:57.797
So I said, I'm translating an author.

01:20:57.817 --> 01:20:58.818
He asked me to send it.

01:20:59.659 --> 01:21:00.179
I sent it.

01:21:00.219 --> 01:21:03.563
He published the thing that I sent in the New Directions annual.

01:21:04.143 --> 01:21:05.405
He liked the author.

01:21:05.445 --> 01:21:14.333
He actually then took out a contract for the man's first book whenever he finished writing his first novel, which I then translated.

01:21:15.374 --> 01:21:17.196
New Directions asked me to read.

01:21:18.172 --> 01:21:28.530
things for them that were in German to recommend them for publication, because Lachlan liked me, and he knew I could translate and cared about German literature.

01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:34.560
And they asked me a couple of things, and I said, no, I don't think that'd go very well in America.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:39.228
Then they sent me something that I liked, and I said, yes, I think that should be published.

01:21:39.288 --> 01:21:41.132
And they asked me to translate it.

01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:42.734
And that started me.

01:21:42.795 --> 01:21:43.656
Now I've done, I think,

01:21:44.665 --> 01:21:47.430
six books for New Directions and translation.

01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:50.134
But, of course, you're very mad as Kafka, you were saying.

01:21:50.154 --> 01:21:58.428
But Kafka is the most famous author translated, although I translated... Pardon me, beyond fame, or the one that seems to have the greatest resonance for you.

01:21:58.448 --> 01:22:10.048
For me, if I could have, if you would have asked me, or told me, you can translate any book from German literature you want to, that's ever been written, I would have picked

01:22:10.737 --> 01:22:12.699
the trial to translate it from.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.221
And I was asked to do it.

01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:17.004
That's a dream that not many people have come true.

01:22:17.304 --> 01:22:19.667
Does it become a different work?

01:22:20.928 --> 01:22:21.529
Absolutely.

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:28.116
The interesting thing to me about translation is that translation is not only a reading.

01:22:28.136 --> 01:22:30.318
Every translation is a reading of the text.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.763
But every translation is a different reading of the text, too.

01:22:34.843 --> 01:22:38.247
If the same text is translated by three different people, it's three

01:22:38.513 --> 01:22:40.036
different readings of that text.

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:44.363
So is the translator a filter, so to speak?

01:22:44.383 --> 01:22:48.169
It's always a filter and a conveyor at the same time.

01:22:48.209 --> 01:22:55.522
It's inevitable that the translation is a translator's reaction to a text in language.

01:22:56.123 --> 01:23:03.475
And the other interesting side of it, to me, is that the translator, in some sense, is the ideal reader.

01:23:03.674 --> 01:23:14.326
When Joyce wrote Finnegan's Wake, he said, you know, I spent 18 years, 17 years writing this novel, and I expect somebody to read, to spend an equivalent time reading it.

01:23:15.508 --> 01:23:24.458
Somebody who writes a novel, yeah, somebody who writes a novel then, and they care about every sentence, and they've paid attention to every sentence.

01:23:24.978 --> 01:23:29.884
The only reader who ever reads a novel and looks at every sentence

01:23:30.742 --> 01:23:35.186
How it's constructed and what it means and why it's there is a translator.

01:23:35.246 --> 01:23:38.429
Nobody ever reads as closely as a translator does.

01:23:38.809 --> 01:23:55.404
When I translate a novel, I've read that novel not once but many times, but I've also looked at and thought about every sentence and how it's put together and why it's put together and how it could be transported into another language effectively.

01:23:55.604 --> 01:23:58.487
Have you ever translated the same work

01:23:58.906 --> 01:24:27.867
multiple on multiple occasions well that's the process one goes through in translation not for publication you know but I could have done it and I could still do it for Kafka for instance in the trial my translation of the trial is was was done because a new critical edition of the original text had come out and they shock and wanted a new translation partly for copyright reasons and that translation I did was a very

01:24:28.285 --> 01:24:35.513
close and faithful translation in the sense that for every sentence in the German, there's one sentence in the English.

01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:39.778
For every paragraph in the German, there's one paragraph in the English.

01:24:40.759 --> 01:24:45.704
All punctuation, for the most part, from sentence to sentence almost stays the same.

01:24:46.565 --> 01:24:51.871
Now, that is... And it's generally not the case in translation.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:57.938
Generally, German sentences, because they're long, often are broken up into shorter sentences, the paragraphing is changed.

01:24:58.171 --> 01:24:59.253
Very standard.

01:24:59.273 --> 01:25:00.755
Were you happy with that?

01:25:00.775 --> 01:25:03.379
I was happy with it because I was trying to reflect.

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.164
I was requested to do it closely and faithfully.

01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:13.376
I was happy to do it because it reflects very closely the critical, new critical edition of the German text.

01:25:13.796 --> 01:25:18.945
And the reader can be sure in English that they're getting something very close to the original.

01:25:18.965 --> 01:25:25.275
Of course, I tried to also make it accurate, so there were no mistakes in it that understood what the German meant.

01:25:25.593 --> 01:25:35.182
And to make it faithful in the sense that it is powerful as a text, because the trial is extremely powerful.

01:25:35.202 --> 01:25:36.143
But I could do it again.

01:25:36.163 --> 01:25:37.084
Could you do it differently?

01:25:37.104 --> 01:25:38.545
Yes, I could do it very differently.

01:25:39.766 --> 01:25:53.980
The way I would do it if I did it again or differently is I would think, what if instead of being faithful in that way, I tried to do the text in a freer way

01:25:54.584 --> 01:26:00.289
with paragraphing and sentences closer to the normal English, what one might do in English.

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:12.020
In other words, instead of writing a translation of Kafka, to say, how might Kafka, had he written in English, how might he have written this text, or what might he have done with it?

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:22.009
Now, that's a little bit different, but, for example, if I were doing it again in this freer way, I would change the paragraphing.

01:26:22.968 --> 01:26:33.243
Because the paragraphing in German does one thing, but paragraphing in English is a different sort of thing than paragraphing in German.

01:26:33.683 --> 01:26:37.869
And I think that there would be certain ways that could be quite effective.

01:26:37.889 --> 01:26:42.536
The other thing is that Kafka's trial is done from a manuscript.

01:26:43.137 --> 01:26:45.140
It was never published during his lifetime.

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:51.068
Therefore, we don't know for sure that the paragraphing is the paragraphing he would have used.

01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:57.216
Nor do we know for sure that he wouldn't have revised sentences or broken them up.

01:26:57.617 --> 01:27:01.141
You can say the same thing about the Aeneas.

01:27:01.241 --> 01:27:02.342
Yes, yes, yes.

01:27:02.943 --> 01:27:07.768
So there could be a freer translation that could be very effective, I think.

01:27:07.788 --> 01:27:13.254
Do you think that every great work, every generation, requires any translation?

01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:14.575
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:20.253
The great mystery, I have actually written an introduction to my translation of the trial.

01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:22.676
Maybe I'll send you the copy so you can see.

01:27:23.297 --> 01:27:40.417
One of the great mysteries of art is that while the original retains somehow its freshness over time, over decades, and even over centuries, that we return to it and read it with great pleasure and great joy, translations age very quickly.

01:27:41.017 --> 01:27:44.882
A translation, if you don't have a new translation every 20 years,

01:27:45.065 --> 01:27:51.151
the translation is dated in a way that somehow the original text seems to be able to avoid.

01:27:51.952 --> 01:28:05.725
So that if I read a translation that was done of Kafka as the Muir translation was done, say, in the 30s, it's in many ways a great translation, but it's clearly 1930s British English.

01:28:05.745 --> 01:28:07.987
You know, it's not Kafka, 1915.

01:28:08.148 --> 01:28:10.610
It's 1930s British English.

01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:14.734
My translation is, let's say, 1990s

01:28:15.608 --> 01:28:20.914
It's not American English, really, because I, of course, avoided Americanisms and so on.

01:28:20.934 --> 01:28:25.279
But basically, it's the language of the 1990s, as effective as I could make it.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.382
But it's a different translation.

01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:36.292
And if it's translated in the year 2010 by someone else, or 2020, it'll have a different cast to it, without a doubt.

01:28:37.013 --> 01:28:44.702
William Blake learning Google and Greek and Italian, so he can illustrate these great works.

01:28:44.722 --> 01:28:44.822
Yeah.

01:28:45.140 --> 01:29:11.012
But for a translation, not only is it a matter that every 10 or 15 years a new translation marks a different level in the history of our language and English as we develop, but in any given year, 10 different people could do a translation of Kafka and produce 10 different versions

01:29:11.954 --> 01:29:17.802
each of which would have their own strengths and probably weaknesses, too, but be different readings and different fields.

01:29:17.822 --> 01:29:26.012
There's also, you may know that a book that was put out which was called something like Six Against Kafka or something like that.

01:29:26.293 --> 01:29:35.305
But anyway, what it was is the opening pages of Kafka's The Trial set in six different typefaces done by six different designers.

01:29:36.206 --> 01:29:39.430
And you read those six, one after another, together in one book,

01:29:40.203 --> 01:29:45.412
You absolutely feel differently inside.

01:29:45.472 --> 01:29:54.507
You feel different inside as you read each individual opening page, based simply on changing the typeface.

01:29:54.827 --> 01:30:03.381
Of course, you take a German, if it's in that old Fractur type, we call it, the sort of one that reminds us of the Third Reich, that's one feeling.

01:30:03.401 --> 01:30:06.987
If you have in a modern sanser a type,

01:30:07.726 --> 01:30:10.088
you have a modern feeling to it.

01:30:10.108 --> 01:30:19.397
One can just feel almost old-fashioned or sort of antiquated, and the other one just feels modern without anything being changed.

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:21.258
Briefly, while we're waiting for Joel.

01:30:21.378 --> 01:30:23.020
Yeah, Joel's just in front of you.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.301
He's just in the men's room now.

01:30:24.321 --> 01:30:24.841
He'll come out.

01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:32.168
Give me a fast run-through on the Carlisle, just for the take on Hitler's, Hitler's, if you can.

01:30:32.188 --> 01:30:33.669
Just for the details of it.

01:30:33.729 --> 01:30:36.552
I went into the bookstore at

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.186
Mags, and went to the German section where nobody buys anything.

01:30:42.167 --> 01:30:43.809
Joel, I'm just repeating this story.

01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:44.891
Whenever you're ready, Joel.

01:30:45.011 --> 01:30:46.012
Okay, it'll be a few.

01:30:46.033 --> 01:30:47.254
I've got to get the card.

01:30:47.354 --> 01:30:48.055
Okay, cool.

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:51.820
Then when I pull up in front, somebody will come in here.

01:30:51.861 --> 01:30:52.361
Okay.

01:30:52.421 --> 01:30:53.703
Brielle, would you like to go with us?

01:30:54.224 --> 01:30:59.050
I'm going to meet at 1 o'clock as candidate for the music library and give her a tour.

01:30:59.531 --> 01:30:59.631
Okay.

01:31:00.092 --> 01:31:01.374
So thanks.

01:31:01.594 --> 01:31:03.356
I'll miss it.

01:31:04.378 --> 01:31:04.598
Okay.

01:31:05.405 --> 01:31:13.534
Went to the German section, because I always went to the German sections because nobody ever buys books or bought books back in 65 about this was.

01:31:14.295 --> 01:31:20.021
And there I saw Life of Friedrich the Great, a German edition in a blue leather binding.

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:23.425
It was just pretty, and I pulled it out and see what it was.

01:31:23.545 --> 01:31:27.149
Open it, and it had book plate, Adolf Hitler's book plate.

01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:32.475
Plus, tipped in as a tight note, obviously, from Mags, saying that

01:31:32.624 --> 01:31:45.924
saying, I bought this book from a German soldier who just was one of the first to enter Hitler's lair at Baptist Garden immediately after the fall of the German troops earlier this year.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:50.691
It's presumably the Fuhrer's own copy with his book played in it.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:59.965
Next to a three-volume set in Vellum of Shakespeare, also with Hitler's book played in them, the

01:32:00.468 --> 01:32:02.812
Carlisle was five pounds.

01:32:03.053 --> 01:32:10.125
At the time, I was paying three pounds for my flat at Oxford per week, so that was something I could just barely afford.

01:32:11.387 --> 01:32:15.775
I believe 25 pounds, 20 or 25 pounds for the three-volume Shakespeare.

01:32:15.815 --> 01:32:22.527
I left that there, took up the Hitler, and said, I want to buy this, and I said, this was Hitler's

01:32:22.979 --> 01:32:27.545
I mean, I was just wonderful to have it in my book.

01:32:27.906 --> 01:32:28.467
Exactly.

01:32:29.088 --> 01:32:33.654
And he said, oh, well, he said, you know, not many people probably looked in that German era.

01:32:33.674 --> 01:32:36.558
It's not really very popular, but that's probably why it's still here.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.045
Obviously, it's been there for 20 years, since 45 to 65.

01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:43.348
Took it back.

01:32:44.049 --> 01:32:49.797
I got Hugh Trevor Roper's book, who was teaching at Oxford, Last Days of Hitler, turned to the index.

01:32:50.317 --> 01:33:00.029
looked up Thomas Carlyle, just see if it might be there, and it says, Carlyle, Thomas, Life of Frederick the Great, Hitler's Favorite Book, page so-and-so.

01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:10.401
I turned to the page and it said, Hitler's favorite book was Carlyle's Life of Frederick the Great, because Hitler identified with Frederick as surrounded by enemies and so forth.

01:33:10.421 --> 01:33:20.273
In fact, he loved the book so much that Goebbels reports in his diary that in the last days in the bunker, Goebbels read aloud from the Life of Frederick the Great to

01:33:20.607 --> 01:33:23.916
Hitler, and the tears stood in the Fuhrer's eyes.

01:33:23.977 --> 01:33:27.065
Do you ever wonder yourself what sections he was reading?

01:33:27.085 --> 01:33:28.369
Yeah, no, absolutely.

01:33:28.409 --> 01:33:29.773
It'd be very interesting.
