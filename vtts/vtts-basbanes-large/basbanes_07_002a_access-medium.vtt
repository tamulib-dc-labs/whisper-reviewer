WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:18.182
talking with Sam S.E.M., and we pronounce it Suter, S-U-T-T-E-R, at the University of Chicago, and we're in the Ludwig, L-U-D-W-I-G, Rosenberger, R-O-S-E, and V-E-R-G-E-R, Library of Judaica.

00:18.262 --> 00:18.883
Very interesting.

00:19.043 --> 00:21.647
I haven't done any Judaica stuff yet.

00:21.667 --> 00:31.422
Well, this is not a Judaica collection that represents what Judaica probably conjures up for you immediately, because there is almost no religious literature in it at all.

00:31.925 --> 00:56.968
What Ludwig was interested in intellectually and what he was interested in collecting was material on the secular history of the Jews, Jewish involvement in various realms of human endeavor through history, and he collected only languages that he could read.

00:57.508 --> 00:57.848
Really?

00:58.869 --> 01:00.130
That's very interesting, isn't it?

01:00.150 --> 01:01.932
And there's very little Hebrew in it.

01:02.418 --> 01:10.608
because he didn't read Hebrew, and I think there's no Yiddish in it, or if so, only a stray volume or two here and there.

01:11.770 --> 01:19.800
He was a housewares wholesaler in Chicago.

01:20.681 --> 01:30.433
He left Germany in the early 20s, went to Palestine for a few years, and left

01:30.802 --> 01:54.582
left palestine i think in 27 or 28 and came to the states and came to chicago almost right away um so that all of his collecting activity really took place after he was here um and he was he was not an incredibly wealthy man this was you know but this this was what was important to him like this is this is where he poured

01:54.983 --> 01:58.307
Every dollar that he could spare.

01:58.628 --> 02:03.194
Is there any anecdotal stuff published on him or written on him?

02:03.854 --> 02:10.022
There's a New York Times article on him which I Xeroxed for you and I've got that out there.

02:10.103 --> 02:11.524
You're anticipating all my needs.

02:12.706 --> 02:22.138
His widow is still alive if you're interested in talking to her and I can give you her address and phone number and so on.

02:22.186 --> 02:24.812
He died a couple of years ago.

02:24.873 --> 02:26.637
This came after his death?

02:27.318 --> 02:29.424
This actually came before his death.

02:30.807 --> 02:33.333
This came to the library in 1980.

02:33.353 --> 02:39.047
He must have died in 88.

02:41.812 --> 02:45.115
He died before or after I left the department.

02:45.195 --> 02:46.436
It doesn't matter.

02:46.456 --> 02:46.696
We'll check.

02:46.716 --> 02:48.558
He died, like, 86, 87, 88.

02:48.658 --> 02:52.621
But the point is, he made the decision to see it come here.

02:52.801 --> 02:53.062
Yes.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.685
And obviously, we weren't the only people interested in this collection.

02:56.765 --> 03:00.228
I would have to say Brandeis and Yashiva would have been right there.

03:00.388 --> 03:05.352
Here's a lovely published version of his catalog.

03:05.372 --> 03:07.914
I can get that at Harvard.

03:07.994 --> 03:11.397
Which he, Breunion College Press, published.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.524
I'm sure that they thought they were going to get the collection.

03:16.045 --> 03:16.545
What happened?

03:16.605 --> 03:17.146
Why didn't they?

03:17.407 --> 03:26.219
Well, I think there were a couple of factors involved in his final decision of where it should go.

03:26.259 --> 03:34.230
He'd had a long personal relationship with Bob Rosenthal, which certainly played a role.

03:36.193 --> 03:42.362
But I think not wanting the books to go somewhere where he wasn't close to them

03:42.578 --> 03:59.425
was very important to him because at the time when he gave the books, he was still in good enough health that he would come out to the university several times a week and spend the morning sort of puttering around in here.

03:59.646 --> 04:01.969
Did you set aside this room for him?

04:01.989 --> 04:02.650
Yeah.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.233
So that was one of the perks.

04:04.253 --> 04:04.453
Yeah.

04:04.914 --> 04:06.537
One of the inducements, shall I say.

04:07.017 --> 04:07.819
Right, right.

04:07.839 --> 04:08.620
Perhaps we have to do it.

04:09.022 --> 04:09.583
Right.

04:09.943 --> 04:11.586
Give me about five figures of numbers.

04:12.468 --> 04:14.912
Roughly 22,000, I think.

04:15.192 --> 04:15.913
And how do you rank it?

04:20.020 --> 04:28.093
I've heard from various sources that at the time that it came here, it was the largest collection of Judaica in private hands.

04:28.732 --> 04:31.695
And he did this on modest means.

04:31.735 --> 04:35.399
Yeah, I mean, he wasn't poor, but neither was he fabulously wealthy.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.781
No, he wasn't a kind of burden.

04:36.981 --> 04:37.161
No.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.023
Great, great, great grandson of the realist.

04:39.664 --> 04:42.146
No, no, no.

04:42.166 --> 04:52.878
And probably another factor in bringing the book, in giving the books here, I think, was the fact that this was a secular institution rather than a religious one.

04:54.059 --> 04:55.701
Hmm, interesting.

04:56.153 --> 05:07.189
Because his view of what he was interested in collecting was Jews in a broader context, not Jewish religion.

05:08.210 --> 05:15.641
And so giving it to an institution where it would be seen in a broader context I think was important to him.

05:16.943 --> 05:23.933
For example, just looking at his rather idiosyncratic categories for the

05:24.200 --> 05:39.492
for the for the collection yeah uh well here look at look at this which stretches from from here to

05:40.079 --> 05:41.060
Well, to here.

05:41.120 --> 05:52.776
Nearly 100 pages in the catalog are Marx, Engels, Jewish Socialists, LaSalle, Rosa Luxemburg, Trotsky.

05:52.836 --> 05:55.119
These are not things that you think of as Judaica.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.661
That's amazing.

05:56.781 --> 05:57.422
Emma Goblin.

05:57.562 --> 05:58.483
Yeah, yeah.

05:58.503 --> 05:59.805
It was a Western woman.

05:59.965 --> 06:02.368
Yeah.

06:02.388 --> 06:07.074
Let's go around the corner and look at some stuff.

06:07.094 --> 06:09.057
What's really...

06:09.509 --> 06:11.091
What's a high spot, would you say?

06:12.834 --> 06:13.896
What's a high spot?

06:15.338 --> 06:16.640
What's really extraordinary?

06:16.660 --> 06:20.727
Is this a collection that's magnificent by its breadth?

06:21.448 --> 06:25.113
I would say so, because it has a lot of stuff here that obviously is not rare.

06:25.234 --> 06:27.697
It's a collection that's great by virtue of the fact that it's a collection.

06:28.218 --> 06:28.459
Right.

06:28.539 --> 06:29.520
Is that a fair assessment?

06:29.560 --> 06:34.428
That's a fair assessment, but there's also incredibly rare stuff here.

06:35.389 --> 06:37.052
There are pieces that are

06:37.302 --> 06:40.705
that as far as he knew and as far as we've been able to determine are unique.

06:42.007 --> 06:45.770
Oh, that's very... I almost missed that one.

06:45.810 --> 06:49.714
That's the kind of thing we're looking for, that I'm looking for.

06:49.754 --> 06:55.700
Now, he could have walked right to things, but... And did he?

06:55.780 --> 06:56.621
He knew the collection.

06:56.701 --> 07:00.785
Yes, and he would say, Now, Sam, it's a book.

07:00.865 --> 07:04.529
It's about this size, and it's in green Morocco.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.470
That's nice.

07:06.496 --> 07:07.577
That's nice.

07:08.699 --> 07:09.380
So you knew him?

07:09.821 --> 07:14.026
Yeah, because actually... That was on your earlier watch, so to speak.

07:14.807 --> 07:29.888
When I was hired in this department, it was just after the collection had come in, and it had just been unpacked, and one of my first assignments was to work through it with him and put it in order.

07:31.631 --> 07:36.317
So I got to know him fairly well.

07:38.947 --> 07:47.077
Where's the Ozzy Hunter?

07:53.005 --> 07:53.506
I love this.

07:59.513 --> 08:04.380
Did he buy basically from dealers or was he a regular book hunter or a scout, do you think?

08:05.061 --> 08:07.243
He'd go all over.

08:07.263 --> 08:08.565
Some of each, I think.

08:08.647 --> 08:14.393
It was very hard to get him talking about where books came from.

08:14.433 --> 08:14.873
Oh, really?

08:15.294 --> 08:18.497
He was very reticent in talking about things.

08:18.977 --> 08:29.528
I think one reason for that was that a lot of these books were books that were on the market because of the Holocaust.

08:30.349 --> 08:37.056
These were books that had been ripped away from someone and eventually came on the market.

08:37.096 --> 08:37.236
Really?

08:37.655 --> 08:38.015
Really?

08:38.376 --> 08:43.543
You know, and so if you think about that very much, that's profoundly disturbing.

08:43.563 --> 08:51.273
A lot of these came from Europe then, obviously, is what we're saying.

08:54.497 --> 08:54.657
Yeah.

08:55.218 --> 09:04.911
For example, I mean, here's an ownership stamp, Bibliothek der Judische Gemeinde Berlin, the library of the Jewish congregation in Berlin.

09:05.482 --> 09:09.747
This is the one that, as far as anyone's been able to determine, is a unique copy.

09:09.987 --> 09:14.652
Well, I better write it down, huh?

09:14.672 --> 09:16.294
I don't blame her.

09:16.314 --> 09:18.977
Yeah, and this will be in that exhibit catalog.

09:20.098 --> 09:21.480
I can point it out to you in there.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.663
That may be easier than trying to write it down.

09:24.683 --> 09:26.065
Which you've given me, right?

09:26.445 --> 09:27.867
Yeah, it's by Osiander.

09:28.407 --> 09:28.908
O-Z?

09:29.629 --> 09:33.153
Yeah, it's spelled O-S-I-A-N-D-E-R.

09:34.154 --> 09:34.714
D-A-R?

09:34.895 --> 09:35.235
E-R.

09:35.587 --> 09:36.689
First name, Andreas.

09:39.274 --> 09:39.574
Unique item.

09:39.915 --> 09:42.640
And it's a 16th century.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.403
He was a Lutheran reformer.

09:45.725 --> 09:56.424
And this is a 16th century pamphlet defending Jews from the accusation that they engaged in blood rituals.

09:56.444 --> 09:59.029
Oh, I've got to tell you something about this.

09:59.262 --> 10:13.476
The title is, if it's true and believable that Jews secretly strangle Christian children and use their blood.

10:14.377 --> 10:15.418
I'm going to go off just for a second.

10:15.498 --> 10:15.718
Sure.

10:16.219 --> 10:17.680
It doesn't fall on anybody.

10:17.781 --> 10:19.042
I'm sorry to get off on that track.

10:19.062 --> 10:19.402
No, it's fine.

10:19.422 --> 10:24.247
But you see, that kind of dovetails with that little thing, that little story that I'm going to tell in my book.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.028
Yeah.

10:25.068 --> 10:26.349
That's a unique item.

10:26.449 --> 10:27.210
That's a unique item.

10:28.912 --> 10:30.634
And we don't know how he got it.

10:31.675 --> 10:32.656
No, no.

10:32.676 --> 10:37.622
He got it after the war sometime, is really all I know.

10:37.682 --> 10:40.005
Did he keep any records of the sources?

10:40.986 --> 10:46.813
Well, there are all sorts of invoices and so on, but they're completely disorganized.

10:47.394 --> 10:48.876
So that's a job for somebody.

10:48.896 --> 10:52.560
It's a job for somebody, and I'm not sure to what extent someone can sort it out.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.083
Well, it all depends on how important it is, too.

10:56.044 --> 10:58.227
If it were important to know, you know,

10:58.443 --> 11:01.408
It could be important to somebody like me, not me.

11:02.330 --> 11:06.497
Then they'll be the ones who can go through it.

11:06.517 --> 11:07.979
Let's look at some other stuff here.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.400
That's nice.

11:09.803 --> 11:14.791
You see, that's where the collector is responsible for the preservation of important things.

11:15.272 --> 11:19.860
This is one of the things that I sold my... One of the...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.143
What was the first edition of Das Kapitales?

11:24.423 --> 11:25.865
That's exceedingly scarce.

11:26.566 --> 11:27.307
May I just touch it?

11:27.628 --> 11:28.449
Sure.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.111
It's important to me.

11:31.453 --> 11:35.038
Really, I didn't realize it was bound so normally.

11:35.338 --> 11:41.486
It's just a regular... That's volume one, and this is volume two.

11:41.527 --> 11:43.910
They weren't published at the same time.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.552
At least you want to... Right.

11:46.353 --> 11:47.314
Das Kapitales.

11:47.855 --> 11:49.257
What was the... First...

11:49.675 --> 11:52.378
The first volume is 1867.

11:52.399 --> 11:53.260
Wow.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.724
And the second one isn't until, uh, 85.

11:58.927 --> 11:59.928
Does he have a Mein Kampf?

12:01.250 --> 12:02.792
Yes, he has several Mein Kampfs.

12:03.052 --> 12:08.700
And there was one that he would always drag out to show people, and I would just cringe.

12:08.720 --> 12:16.830
I mean, you know, instead of showing some of the other things, this was always one of the first things that he wanted to show people.

12:17.958 --> 12:20.561
And now his wife does the same, his widow does the same.

12:20.802 --> 12:21.323
Why though?

12:21.443 --> 12:21.583
Why?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.027
Is this going to be made clear to me when you do this?

12:26.069 --> 12:34.821
His wife says that this was used on a ceremonial occasion in Nuremberg.

12:35.782 --> 12:38.165
I can't document that.

12:38.285 --> 12:41.089
I never repeat that.

12:41.269 --> 12:44.033
This is about a double folio size.

12:45.835 --> 12:46.857
It's enormous.

12:46.997 --> 12:47.678
What's the binding?

12:47.698 --> 12:48.299
Is that a vellum?

12:48.319 --> 12:50.963
It's vellum, yeah.

12:51.124 --> 12:53.007
Oh, go back.

12:53.027 --> 12:53.708
Oh, okay.

12:53.748 --> 12:57.354
Oh, my God.

12:58.475 --> 12:58.976
There it is.

12:59.898 --> 13:09.112
And it was obviously done... It was obviously reproduced photographically from the first edition.

13:09.794 --> 13:10.214
This was?

13:10.415 --> 13:10.695
Yeah.

13:12.211 --> 13:20.519
That's obviously how you get it, because if you compare it page for page... The type is the same.

13:20.559 --> 13:24.883
The type is the same.

13:24.943 --> 13:27.585
That's about, would you just estimate the size of that?

13:31.049 --> 13:36.574
Wow, that's about... That's probably about 22 inches, something like that.

13:36.594 --> 13:39.517
22 inches by perhaps a foot and a half.

13:39.777 --> 13:39.957
Yeah.

13:40.443 --> 13:41.365
Yeah.

13:41.585 --> 13:42.367
Wow.

13:43.349 --> 13:44.912
And this is the first right now?

13:44.972 --> 13:45.873
Yeah, this is the first.

13:46.174 --> 13:47.937
So this was reproduced from the first?

13:48.218 --> 13:48.458
Right.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.666
And there's the Frentice piece with Adolf Hitler.

13:52.686 --> 13:54.891
Does this also have a Hitler Frentice piece?

13:54.911 --> 13:55.832
No, no.

13:56.734 --> 13:57.716
Who was the publisher of this?

13:58.938 --> 14:01.143
It doesn't, it doesn't seem to... What is this?

14:01.363 --> 14:03.447
Can you read that to me?

14:03.848 --> 14:14.225
All rights reserved, copyright, volume 1, 1925, volume 2, 1927, by Franz Eyer's successors, Incorporated, Munich.

14:14.786 --> 14:16.128
Which is here.

14:19.113 --> 14:25.202
Well, now here, this is published by the central press of the Nazi party.

14:26.064 --> 14:27.126
Wow.

14:27.166 --> 14:31.172
And then it says Franz Eyer's successors, Incorporated,

14:31.557 --> 14:36.124
Munich, so they must have absorbed the firm or something.

14:36.504 --> 14:38.307
E-H-E-R.

14:38.587 --> 14:44.256
The first firm was 1925.

14:44.396 --> 14:47.601
I didn't realize it went back that far.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.143
Here's another.

14:49.203 --> 14:54.471
This is just like Das Kapital in terms of the two volumes appearing separately.

14:54.631 --> 14:58.797
This is the second volume, which is 27.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.043
And so when he would show this, what did he say?

15:02.143 --> 15:03.465
What kinds of things did he say?

15:06.589 --> 15:07.410
I'm trying to remember.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.774
It's almost like a religious... Yeah, yeah.

15:14.519 --> 15:17.783
What he would say was that as far as he knew, there were only two copies of it.

15:17.803 --> 15:21.708
Now, I don't know where... I don't remember where the other copy was.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.154
Do you realize how many horrible things this one was present at?

15:26.494 --> 15:27.035
Yeah, yeah.

15:27.655 --> 15:29.037
You know, what this must have been used.

15:29.398 --> 15:29.678
Yeah.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.653
something, isn't it?

15:34.674 --> 15:35.575
Oh, I know what to show you.

15:38.137 --> 15:38.237
Wow.

15:38.257 --> 15:40.560
If we can't stay in here too long, we've got to see other things.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.862
By the way, you let me know where you have to go out.

15:43.463 --> 15:46.766
Oh, I can take whatever time we need.

15:46.786 --> 15:47.086
Okay, good.

15:47.107 --> 15:52.332
I mean, I don't want to interrupt any luncheon appointments or something.

15:52.352 --> 15:57.277
No, I don't really have anything else on the dog.

15:57.297 --> 15:57.417
Oh.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.120
Jacuzzi.

16:00.995 --> 16:28.622
is this the this is right the driver's affair yeah that's it and this is yeah and you know this is the famous article that's the email Zola article that's it yep let me just take a couple notes and we'll shut up this is a relevant it's not it's not a complete run but it's relevant issues of Leroy dealing dealing with the drivers affair l apostrophe a-u-r-o-r

16:30.374 --> 16:36.441
And what we have done is encapsulate them because the paper is so fragile.

16:36.461 --> 16:40.285
It wouldn't survive being turned.

16:40.305 --> 16:41.547
I'm sure you've copied these.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.729
These are available on microfiche or microfilm.

16:43.749 --> 16:47.193
Yeah.

16:47.213 --> 16:50.958
They got them in pretty nice shape, too, didn't they?

16:50.978 --> 16:51.078
Yeah.

16:51.098 --> 16:51.198
Yeah.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.019
Well, maybe we ought to move on.

16:52.059 --> 16:54.222
We can just see if we can sort of circle around this way.

16:54.242 --> 16:54.602
That's fine.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.084
Are you going to leave those out?

16:56.484 --> 16:56.644
Yeah.

16:56.664 --> 16:57.225
We can get them out for now.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.062
You have a seismograph in here?

17:02.003 --> 17:02.343
No.

17:02.524 --> 17:03.865
Is that what that is over there?

17:04.106 --> 17:07.590
It registers temperature and humidity.

17:07.610 --> 17:07.950
Oh, okay.

17:07.970 --> 17:08.531
That's for the world.

17:08.551 --> 17:09.813
It looks like a seismograph.

17:09.873 --> 17:11.715
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

17:11.735 --> 17:13.117
Lots of editions of Josephus.

17:17.683 --> 17:18.123
Beautiful.

17:19.946 --> 17:21.327
Well, here are some incunables, right?

17:21.447 --> 17:24.932
Yeah, yeah.

17:24.952 --> 17:26.514
How many incunables would you say?

17:26.534 --> 17:27.415
In this collection.

17:31.141 --> 17:35.847
I think there must be a dozen and a half, something like that.

17:35.867 --> 17:36.708
You're going to have to open it up.

17:36.728 --> 17:37.849
Yeah.

17:37.869 --> 17:41.494
Is that much use from the scholarly community?

17:42.716 --> 17:44.097
Not as much as it should.

17:44.718 --> 17:49.825
Unfortunately, at this point, none of these books are represented in the general catalog.

17:51.126 --> 17:52.948
And that's something we'd like to change.

17:53.409 --> 17:57.334
And unfortunately, people here

17:58.090 --> 18:06.120
Rosenberger collection of Judaica, and it doesn't occur to them to look here for things like all that Jewish socialist material and so on.

18:08.163 --> 18:12.588
So we want to do something to change that.

18:12.668 --> 18:13.389
You have to look at it.

18:13.409 --> 18:14.070
It's not important.

18:14.150 --> 18:14.931
Don't bother.

18:15.432 --> 18:19.257
It might be Edgar Lee Masters.

18:19.517 --> 18:21.880
I think it might be Edgar Lee Masters.

18:22.481 --> 18:23.723
I didn't know his son, Hillary.

18:25.345 --> 18:27.287
This is part of the...

18:28.752 --> 18:32.797
John Carrar collection of rare books in the history of science, medicine, and technology.

18:32.877 --> 18:35.219
This is a preeminent collection.

18:35.820 --> 18:36.221
It is.

18:36.901 --> 18:39.464
Carrar himself had nothing to do with collecting it.

18:41.326 --> 18:50.677
He was a Chicago railroad man who left a bequest for a free public library.

18:51.378 --> 18:53.000
Chicago has these things.

18:53.140 --> 18:54.862
It's like the Newbery thing.

18:54.882 --> 18:58.506
Yeah, so this is the counterpart of the Newbery.

18:59.600 --> 19:16.690
Fairly early on, I think in 1909 or something like that, the Newberry, the Crerar, and Chicago Public sat down together and decided that they ought to each define a scope for themselves.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.034
Scope Crerar for my typist, please.

19:19.355 --> 19:20.837
C-R-E-R-A-R.

19:21.178 --> 19:22.941
Thank you.

19:24.963 --> 19:30.849
And so the Currar Library then specialized in medicine, science, and technology.

19:31.429 --> 19:33.872
Newberry specialized in the humanities.

19:34.092 --> 19:36.394
And the Public Library was the more popular collection.

19:36.414 --> 19:39.037
And there were some materials that were exchanged at that point.

19:39.057 --> 19:42.120
There is an interesting triumvirate in Chicago, isn't there?

19:42.360 --> 19:50.888
There are three parts, I guess, where the decisions were made that directions would be certain directions.

19:50.909 --> 19:51.369
Is that right?

19:52.090 --> 19:52.590
Yeah.

19:52.670 --> 19:53.451
Is that true?

19:54.511 --> 19:55.653
And it's worked out for everybody.

19:55.693 --> 19:56.454
Right.

19:56.494 --> 20:02.342
So this, the PRR existed as an independent institution until 1980.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.265
God, that's great.

20:05.146 --> 20:06.708
Four, I believe.

20:07.029 --> 20:07.189
Wow.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.492
I think that's the date of the merger.

20:09.713 --> 20:14.239
This is a very impressive role.

20:14.259 --> 20:19.927
They had a harder and harder time making a go of it and then merged with the university.

20:20.408 --> 20:21.970
And at that point, we built...

20:22.540 --> 20:27.946
We built a new science library that's a block and a half away from here that's called the Career R Library.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.049
But this is the core collection.

20:30.069 --> 20:32.412
And this is the rare collection.

20:33.012 --> 20:36.536
Was this built by institutional collectors, basically?

20:38.218 --> 20:41.182
Or do we have any input here from private collections?

20:41.202 --> 20:43.425
There are a couple of private collections within it.

20:44.706 --> 20:47.890
There's the Nicholas Sen collection, which we'll see downstairs.

20:49.211 --> 20:52.395
Sen was a surgeon.

20:53.675 --> 20:56.339
And that's probably 8,000 volumes or so.

20:57.400 --> 21:04.190
There's the Gruley collection in pediatrics and the Levis cookbook collection.

21:05.793 --> 21:10.940
And I think all of those have non-rare as well as rare.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.824
I'm surprised you guys didn't rule Louis for the cookbook collection.

21:14.345 --> 21:15.346
I think we were too late.

21:15.747 --> 21:21.235
Yeah, you know, I know what happened to that outside when we were off the machine.

21:23.729 --> 21:30.600
Now, this looks intriguing.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.481
Oh, that's something, huh?

21:33.925 --> 21:34.726
What do we call this?

21:35.828 --> 21:40.816
Well, it's a typical German stamped vellum binding.

21:46.665 --> 21:49.289
And this is a German herbal.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.272
It's a herbal.

21:52.653 --> 21:54.155
These are wood engravings, they must be?

21:54.175 --> 21:58.239
Yeah.

21:58.259 --> 21:58.899
Magnificent.

21:58.919 --> 22:00.321
It's the original binding.

22:00.341 --> 22:02.343
It's a knockout of a book.

22:02.863 --> 22:03.204
How old?

22:05.987 --> 22:06.827
What have we got here?

22:06.847 --> 22:07.648
1625.

22:07.668 --> 22:16.177
Yeah, and this is definitely a 17th century binding.

22:16.197 --> 22:20.161
In fact, it's almost like a late 16th century binding.

22:20.181 --> 22:21.242
It's rather a condition.

22:24.817 --> 22:28.660
So that's a very interesting story, isn't he?

22:28.680 --> 22:29.021
Yeah.

22:29.601 --> 22:44.153
The thing that's funny is that he was a very devout Presbyterian, I guess it was, and gave all sorts of money for Presbyterian Sunday schools and so on.

22:44.594 --> 22:54.722
And the language of his will setting up this library specifies that this money is not to go for

22:55.327 --> 22:55.989
Um,

22:56.896 --> 22:59.459
Dirty French novels or skeptical trash.

22:59.899 --> 23:01.120
Is there a... Can I get a card?

23:01.140 --> 23:02.482
I'll get that somewhere for you, yeah.

23:02.522 --> 23:04.624
You've got to do that for me.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.146
I'm doing a thing with Wills, you know.

23:06.186 --> 23:08.088
The Wills are becoming very... It's happening.

23:08.248 --> 23:13.934
I mean, the Pepys codicil and the Newbery thing with the daughters who died without issues.

23:14.174 --> 23:14.574
Right, yes.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.575
That's a fascinating thing.

23:15.756 --> 23:18.559
I mean, who would have thought that there was never going to be a library as a result of that?

23:18.579 --> 23:22.803
And then in New York, you've got the Lennox and the Esters and then Tilden.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.507
You know, they had no idea the New York Public Library was going to come out of that.

23:26.567 --> 23:26.667
Yeah.

23:26.647 --> 23:30.032
But there were provisions there for this kind of thing to happen.

23:30.573 --> 23:39.928
So, of course, at the time of the merger, we had to hire all sorts of extra help to do all kinds of projects related to it.

23:39.948 --> 23:43.633
Well, some of the staff members got the idea to do a t-shirt for the project.

23:44.114 --> 23:53.008
And they took a book plate, which says,

23:53.360 --> 23:55.022
Great is the gift that bringeth knowledge.

23:55.522 --> 23:58.385
Great is the gift that bringeth knowledge.

23:58.845 --> 24:02.549
That's a nice, uh, whatever you call that.

24:02.849 --> 24:03.410
Yes.

24:03.430 --> 24:05.472
And that's, did they use his picture?

24:05.532 --> 24:06.413
They used his picture.

24:06.593 --> 24:12.378
But then they added a caption below that said, no dirty French novels or skeptical trash.

24:12.398 --> 24:13.399
Do they still sell that?

24:13.419 --> 24:14.801
Is that around?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.322
I don't think there are any around.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.964
I've got one at home.

24:17.984 --> 24:18.624
That's great.

24:18.644 --> 24:20.346
That's great.

24:20.849 --> 24:23.291
This is the treasure room, so to speak, for the Kruar.

24:24.052 --> 24:27.375
Actually, this is only half of the Kruar Rare Collection.

24:27.395 --> 24:28.716
The other half is downstairs.

24:28.776 --> 24:29.457
We'll see it down there.

24:29.477 --> 24:30.558
We didn't have a big enough place.

24:30.578 --> 24:34.481
What do you do to protect the stuff?

24:34.801 --> 24:36.403
Is it Halloween?

24:36.583 --> 24:37.284
No, we don't.

24:37.384 --> 24:38.285
That's controversial.

24:38.565 --> 24:39.205
Tell me about it.

24:40.366 --> 24:40.687
J.C.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.148
Brown is just opening its new wing.

24:45.031 --> 24:47.132
This is what we call the manuscript search room.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.995
The idea was to bring together in one place

24:50.363 --> 24:59.091
the basic tools that one would need for studying manuscripts or preparing to work with manuscripts.

24:59.952 --> 25:13.143
So we have most of the library's holdings on paleography and most of the library's holdings of printed catalogs of manuscript collections around the world.

25:13.203 --> 25:18.328
And there's a professor in the classics department who teaches

25:19.017 --> 25:27.171
course nearly every year on the Latin Codex book, and he usually holds the class in here and uses codices from the collection.

25:27.191 --> 25:33.643
This Lincoln collection over here, that's something that we sat among there?

25:33.743 --> 25:35.406
Yeah.

25:36.365 --> 25:40.531
The Great Lincoln Collection is with the Illinois State Historical Society, isn't that right?

25:40.892 --> 25:41.212
Yeah.

25:41.232 --> 25:43.355
And that's the standard by which all others are measured.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.119
So we don't really have to go into this until we... Yeah.

25:46.279 --> 25:57.055
The core of this collection was collected by William Barton, who was an amateur Lincoln biographer early in the century.

25:58.457 --> 26:06.068
And he gave his collection to the... I don't know if it was he or maybe his heirs gave the collection to the university in...

26:06.368 --> 26:08.992
It's books, basically.

26:09.012 --> 26:10.273
It's not primary stuff.

26:10.373 --> 26:18.805
There are manuscripts downstairs as well, and incredible amounts of ephemera, most of which are of no scholarly interest whatsoever.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.387
He turned over everything.

26:21.188 --> 26:25.554
And then the family endowed a fund to continue to add to the collection.

26:25.574 --> 26:34.907
And eventually you have to start branching out in other related areas in order to keep using the money.

26:35.225 --> 26:40.850
There's a fair amount of Civil War material, material on slavery, and so on.

26:42.531 --> 26:46.535
This is part of the Helen and Ruth Regenstein collection of rare books.

26:46.935 --> 26:48.736
R-E-G-E-N-S-T-E-I-N.

26:49.037 --> 26:51.078
And this is the Joseph Regenstein Library.

26:51.679 --> 26:53.120
Helen and Ruth were what, sisters?

26:53.380 --> 26:54.521
No, mother and daughter.

26:54.601 --> 26:55.122
Mother and daughter.

26:55.142 --> 26:55.902
Were they collectors?

26:57.764 --> 26:58.745
Helen was a collector.

26:58.765 --> 26:59.065
Oh, great.

26:59.165 --> 26:59.465
Yes.

27:00.146 --> 27:02.628
Finding good women collectors isn't that easy thing to do.

27:03.569 --> 27:04.810
Ruth...

27:05.296 --> 27:10.142
Ruth, the daughter, I think was not really involved in the collecting, off the record.

27:10.162 --> 27:22.098
I think she's sort of a borderline retarded person who, if she'd been born into an unprivileged family, probably would have made it on her own.

27:22.499 --> 27:26.104
But I think what we're saying is that her name is attached to the bequest.

27:26.124 --> 27:27.205
It's attached to the collection.

27:27.525 --> 27:30.950
To the bequest, I'm sure.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.552
Actually, Ruth is still alive.

27:32.768 --> 28:00.312
um it's not important helen helen gave what she had collected and then then gave money to continue collecting and in the early years she she and bob worked very closely together to continue to develop the collection uh this is great stuff uh bought a copy of post hammer lane which i can show you in the vault after a while yeah we don't have one in new england

28:00.983 --> 28:02.485
New England doesn't have one.

28:02.505 --> 28:03.247
Not another one.

28:03.287 --> 28:05.811
Well, I mean, Harvard doesn't have one.

28:05.831 --> 28:07.053
Harvard would like one.

28:07.594 --> 28:11.700
And at Mass Historical, at the Athenaeum, I beg your pardon.

28:12.402 --> 28:14.225
What was the source of their fortune?

28:14.245 --> 28:16.949
It must have been considerable to be able to buy a Tamerlane.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.214
Belsicol Chemical Company.

28:20.936 --> 28:21.376
How do you spell?

28:21.797 --> 28:26.164
Belsicol.

28:26.971 --> 28:33.700
He also, I guess, as I understand it, was the person who came up with the idea of the windowed envelope.

28:38.247 --> 28:39.929
So that's where the money came.

28:39.949 --> 28:41.291
What was the focus of the collection?

28:41.311 --> 28:44.896
I see there's the 1612 first edition of Chapman's Homer.

28:46.278 --> 28:47.820
You mentioned a post-Tamerling.

28:48.221 --> 28:56.472
Well, the original focus of the collection, and I guess still the primary focus of the collection, is

28:56.857 --> 29:06.769
is high spots of English and American literature, but also, quote, continental works of recognized merit.

29:07.330 --> 29:10.473
Such as Anna Karenin, War and Peace.

29:10.494 --> 29:17.662
She was interested in things like, you know, first translations into English of things that were classics.

29:19.104 --> 29:24.210
I've got that information in the life of George Washington.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.071
Do you have it in parts?

29:25.412 --> 29:25.592
No.

29:26.333 --> 29:26.593
No.

29:26.945 --> 29:32.831
So I don't have it, right?

29:33.912 --> 29:36.055
There it is, in parts, by Putnam.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.000
Yep.

29:41.020 --> 29:41.140
Nice.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.843
Good stuff.

29:43.863 --> 29:45.745
This is Parklands, Oregon Trail.

29:50.170 --> 29:52.412
There's a whole section in the vault.

29:52.797 --> 29:54.600
which we should go into soon.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.903
The whole section of her stuff.

29:57.364 --> 29:58.986
Decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.368
Boy, can I just see one of those?

30:01.029 --> 30:01.570
Sure, sure.

30:01.590 --> 30:06.598
Anything you spot here that grabs your fancy, just to say so.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.565
Gibbon was quite a full collector in his own way.

30:12.547 --> 30:13.188
Oh, boy.

30:13.748 --> 30:17.694
Now, this must have been... You don't think that this was rebound, I would say.

30:18.315 --> 30:20.138
You think that was how the original binding is?

30:22.717 --> 30:27.663
This is probably a contemporary, a roughly contemporary binding, I would think.

30:27.683 --> 30:28.164
Wonderful.

30:28.444 --> 30:31.768
It feels nice.

30:31.968 --> 30:35.572
Yeah.

30:35.592 --> 30:36.834
This is the second volume.

30:36.854 --> 30:40.999
That's right.

30:41.019 --> 30:42.761
MDCCLXXI.

30:42.781 --> 30:45.624
1781.

30:45.644 --> 30:46.666
1781.

30:47.987 --> 30:48.248
Great.

30:48.628 --> 30:49.869
That was Gibbon, Annette.

30:51.191 --> 30:52.032
Declared for.

30:57.091 --> 30:58.352
Let's go into the vault.

31:00.714 --> 31:05.459
Somebody will let us in because since I know I'm the member of the department, I don't know the combination.

31:05.499 --> 31:06.139
This is nice.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.141
Which is fine with me.

31:11.905 --> 31:13.406
This is an enormous room.

31:13.767 --> 31:15.148
Yeah, and there's another room down below.

31:15.188 --> 31:15.448
Really?

31:15.608 --> 31:23.976
This is as big as they come.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.343
This is the vault, right?

31:27.363 --> 31:27.944
This is the vault.

31:31.047 --> 31:33.690
I was in Newbury's vault yesterday, which is kind of nice.

31:38.476 --> 31:39.837
Here I will put my tent away.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.459
That would make you feel a little better.

31:41.479 --> 31:42.861
That would make me feel better.

31:48.748 --> 31:50.510
It's a remarkable shape, isn't it?

31:50.530 --> 31:50.790
Yeah.

31:52.222 --> 32:00.736
Now, I don't remember what he paid for this, but there was a lot of publicity at the time.

32:02.159 --> 32:02.840
Which one is this?

32:02.860 --> 32:03.221
Do you know?

32:03.241 --> 32:05.184
They have names.

32:05.204 --> 32:06.987
I wonder if this is the one that came out of Worcester.

32:08.069 --> 32:08.570
I don't know.

32:08.610 --> 32:11.695
That's something I can check on for you and let you know.

32:11.755 --> 32:12.737
Yeah, a small thing.

32:14.460 --> 32:15.622
That is Tamerlane.

32:16.022 --> 32:17.605
T-A-M-E-R-L-A-N-E.

32:21.517 --> 32:24.721
which is now an exhibit at the North Public Library, too.

32:24.801 --> 32:28.225
Oh, that's nice.

32:28.305 --> 32:31.849
This contains the treasures of many collectors, right?

32:31.889 --> 32:32.630
Many collectors.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.632
Yes, yes.

32:34.652 --> 32:37.155
Now, which of these is the Malgold I want?

32:39.638 --> 32:47.648
No, it's the other one.

32:47.668 --> 32:48.088
Two copies.

32:48.108 --> 32:51.372
There are two copies of the whale here.

32:52.077 --> 32:55.824
The whale, of course, is British in the first verse.

32:55.904 --> 32:57.868
This is the Helen and Ruth Regenstein copy.

32:58.349 --> 33:06.944
It's inscribed, Henry Hubbard from his old shipmate and watchmate aboard, no, on board, the good ship, A-C-H-U-S-H-N-E-T.

33:07.044 --> 33:15.520
Alas, wrecked at last on the Northwest, Herman Melville, March 23rd, 1853, Pittsfield.

33:17.272 --> 33:19.054
Alas, comma, just let me do it.

33:19.295 --> 33:19.855
Sure.

33:19.875 --> 33:31.991
Wrecked at last on the nor, N-O-R apostrophe, W-E-S-T, close parentheses, Herman Melville, March 23, 1853, Pittsburgh.

33:32.972 --> 33:33.753
May I?

33:33.773 --> 33:35.976
Sure.

33:35.996 --> 33:37.719
And this is the whale, by the way.

33:37.759 --> 33:38.780
This is not Moby Dick.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.383
This is the first first.

33:41.403 --> 33:44.748
London Bentley.

33:44.768 --> 33:45.068
Wow.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.785
That's heady.

33:48.805 --> 33:50.608
And it's three volumes, isn't it?

33:50.848 --> 34:10.795
It's three volumes, yeah.

34:11.255 --> 34:13.899
This is the Goodspeed collection of biblical manuscripts.

34:13.919 --> 34:14.700
Is this our Goodspeed collection?

34:15.406 --> 34:16.428
The Boston Goodspeed?

34:16.468 --> 34:16.709
No.

34:16.809 --> 34:18.272
This is Edgar Goodspeed.

34:18.332 --> 34:21.558
No, I didn't think he had that kind of a collection.

34:21.879 --> 34:26.207
He was the first PhD graduate of our Divinity School.

34:26.227 --> 34:27.329
That's not our Goodspeed.

34:31.497 --> 34:31.858
Okay.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.581
Well, in fact, here we are.

34:33.601 --> 34:35.705
Here are the Edward... Oh, no.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.190
That's Edward Goodman Gospels.

34:39.976 --> 34:46.204
So he was a biblical scholar, but also had money, I think, through his wife's family.

34:47.566 --> 35:00.123
So this is a combination of things that he bought and gave to the university, or things that he attracted as gifts through family connections, or things that he had the university buy.

35:00.544 --> 35:02.426
Can you tell me basically what they are?

35:02.586 --> 35:06.251
We're looking at exceedingly old things, I would say.

35:06.351 --> 35:06.772
Is that right?

35:07.713 --> 35:07.853
Yeah.

35:08.354 --> 35:09.055
Yeah.

35:11.431 --> 35:17.961
And you are giving me a catalogue.

35:17.981 --> 35:27.154
There's the Argos electionary, which I think is 10th century.

35:28.857 --> 35:29.798
Is that vellum?

35:29.818 --> 35:32.502
It's vellum, yeah.

35:32.542 --> 35:33.443
That's in Greek, right?

35:33.464 --> 35:34.064
It's in Greek.

35:37.990 --> 35:40.594
Some of these are wonderful for

35:42.413 --> 35:44.516
with their illuminations.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.919
Yeah, I'd love to see my illuminations.

35:46.939 --> 35:47.680
That I won't touch.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.843
Now, this isn't as old.

35:51.285 --> 35:56.773
This is the Elizabeth Day McCormick Apocalypse, circa 1600, and it's on paper rather than vellum.

35:57.814 --> 35:58.535
Hmm, so binding.

36:01.379 --> 36:02.140
It's beautifully done.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.947
Let's put this pen over here.

36:06.967 --> 36:07.788
You've had that for a while.

36:08.129 --> 36:08.349
Yeah.

36:10.011 --> 36:11.914
Yeah, this must have been in the 20s or 30s sometimes.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.162
Oh, my goodness.

36:16.243 --> 36:17.685
Oh, look at, my God.

36:21.530 --> 36:23.833
And it's just page after page like this.

36:27.237 --> 36:28.138
That's exceptional.

36:30.802 --> 36:31.542
And how old is this?

36:32.243 --> 36:33.465
This is circa 1600.

36:33.485 --> 36:34.346
Really?

36:34.366 --> 36:37.430
So this is, printing has been invented, but this is a manuscript.

36:37.570 --> 36:37.790
Right.

36:39.472 --> 36:41.235
Do we know who the illuminator is?

36:43.037 --> 36:43.217
Uh...

36:43.720 --> 36:45.042
I don't know if we know or not.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.187
That one's really pretty nice.

36:49.327 --> 36:49.627
Yeah.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.471
That's a favorite of you, isn't it?

36:52.491 --> 36:52.631
Yes.

36:53.172 --> 36:56.416
Well, there's another one here that I would love to show you but can't.

36:58.198 --> 37:01.923
You've made my day already.

37:02.243 --> 37:12.336
Because it's comparable to this in terms, it's the Rockefeller McCormick New Testament, which also has lots and lots of, isn't that the one she bought at the wholesale?

37:13.397 --> 37:13.457
No.

37:14.197 --> 37:15.338
I think it may be.

37:15.458 --> 37:20.564
It's got lots and lots of illuminations, and it's on vellum.

37:21.085 --> 37:35.382
The problem is the vellum is cockling, and any time you expose it to a change in temperature... This was the Elizabeth Day McCormick Apocalypse.

37:35.402 --> 37:37.925
She's in my... I'm going to shut up a sec.

37:38.485 --> 37:39.427
I love some of these names.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.389
The Red Gospels of Gangesar.

37:41.449 --> 37:44.052
It's G-A-N-J-A-S-A-R.

37:45.247 --> 37:51.132
All of these you'll find more on in the Goodspeed catalog that I give you.

37:51.372 --> 37:54.015
Okay.

37:54.035 --> 37:55.596
This is an Armenian manuscript.

37:56.557 --> 37:57.798
Known as the Red Gospel.

37:59.559 --> 38:00.660
And if that's in the catalog.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.781
Yeah, 1050.

38:02.582 --> 38:02.822
Wow.

38:02.842 --> 38:04.824
That's the approximate date.

38:05.705 --> 38:08.307
And it's called the Red Gospel.

38:08.827 --> 38:09.528
You can see why.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.389
Describe it for me.

38:10.549 --> 38:11.370
What are we looking at?

38:11.490 --> 38:15.253
Well, we're looking at the...

38:16.499 --> 38:23.891
Illuminations on the first opening here, and the predominant color is certainly red in both of them.

38:25.854 --> 38:27.156
It's 900 years old.

38:34.708 --> 38:34.788
Yep.

38:34.809 --> 38:36.251
So there's the Armenian script.

38:39.636 --> 38:43.703
Is it unbelievable how these illuminations can last for almost a millennium?

38:43.723 --> 38:43.823
Yeah.

38:44.815 --> 38:46.617
And some of them are in remarkable condition.

38:50.340 --> 38:50.801
That's nice.

38:53.163 --> 39:00.210
That was the Armenian, the red, and that's in the catalog, right?

39:00.310 --> 39:01.531
Yeah.

39:06.876 --> 39:14.383
You did say upstairs, before we went on tape, that one thing you'd like to do is to integrate all the collections

39:15.038 --> 39:19.805
Is this kind of an example of that, what we're looking at in a microcosm?

39:19.925 --> 39:21.307
Yeah, yeah, I would say so.

39:22.128 --> 39:25.733
To put things with other things that they belong with intellectually.

39:26.694 --> 39:30.860
So, but it is a case of collections complementing.

39:31.862 --> 39:33.744
There is a synergy involved, in other words.

39:33.764 --> 39:35.367
Yes, yes, yes, certainly.

39:35.707 --> 39:42.717
And we've had a number of collectors over the years, particularly faculty collectors, who have consciously collected...

39:43.253 --> 39:47.478
things that they knew we didn't have, knowing that their collection was going to come here someday.

39:47.538 --> 39:51.183
And that it would build and fill in existing collections.

39:56.870 --> 40:02.937
But what do you say to a collector who has this ego thing and wants... It's very delicate.

40:02.997 --> 40:04.198
It's very delicate.

40:04.399 --> 40:09.565
To have it endure as a monument to his or her connoisseurship, you know, and taste.

40:10.203 --> 40:14.227
Delicate is the answer.

40:14.247 --> 40:16.089
Oh, this is a Boccaccio manuscript.

40:16.570 --> 40:17.230
Boccaccio.

40:19.353 --> 40:19.633
Good.

40:19.953 --> 40:20.414
Right.

40:21.074 --> 40:24.057
What catalog is this in?

40:24.458 --> 40:32.546
This is in the catalog that I'm giving you that was for the exhibit that marked the opening of this building in 1970.

40:33.167 --> 40:35.690
And in fact, the cover design comes from this.

40:35.770 --> 40:38.893
Just so I can look for it, because this is magnificent.

40:40.510 --> 40:44.054
This is Boccaccio's genealogy of the pagan gods.

40:49.281 --> 41:00.334
And most of the pictures in here are genealogical charts showing who is related to whom.

41:00.374 --> 41:04.198
When was this book produced?

41:05.901 --> 41:07.142
This is roughly

41:09.046 --> 41:12.991
Roughly contemporary with Boccaccio.

41:14.393 --> 41:18.339
And from whom did this come?

41:20.382 --> 41:20.782
What is this?

41:20.923 --> 41:22.865
I don't remember what the story is on this one.

41:22.885 --> 41:23.186
Oh, here.

41:23.446 --> 41:25.389
Well, it was bought out of general library funds.

41:25.869 --> 41:27.331
When does it say?

41:27.752 --> 41:28.813
It doesn't say here.

41:28.874 --> 41:31.457
I would guess it will say in the catalog.

41:31.497 --> 41:33.921
And if not, I can check for you.

41:33.941 --> 41:34.882
That's OK.

41:35.102 --> 41:36.805
I would guess in the 20s sometime.

41:38.006 --> 41:38.547
Goodbye.

41:38.797 --> 41:46.086
I wonder if they brought it through a dealer or... Oh, look, what's that?

41:46.867 --> 41:47.508
What happened there?

41:47.608 --> 41:48.389
That's a big worm.

41:48.809 --> 41:51.613
I think it's an acid burn of some kind.

41:52.334 --> 41:57.460
Something was spilled on it, and then they cut to repair, because you can see here.

42:00.904 --> 42:01.145
Wow.

42:04.869 --> 42:05.530
Magnificent.

42:12.530 --> 42:17.015
We don't have to go through everything, by the way.

42:17.595 --> 42:19.397
Yeah.

42:19.477 --> 42:20.178
I get the idea.

42:20.218 --> 42:21.079
I think that's fine.

42:21.099 --> 42:32.931
This isn't the kind of library that some of the other libraries that you've visited are, where there's a real emphasis on gathering high spots like this.

42:32.992 --> 42:39.178
I mean, a lot of these have come in coincidentally, and a lot of the effort in building the collection has been in building a research

42:39.952 --> 42:41.654
collection that serves the institution.

42:43.176 --> 42:47.502
That was definitely Bob Rosenthal's philosophy.

42:47.602 --> 42:52.169
Would you say that the collections follow the curriculum, generally?

42:52.529 --> 42:57.896
Or do you have some things that are just wonderful to own that have nothing to do with anything that's taught here?

42:58.056 --> 43:04.105
Yeah, we certainly have things that are wonderful that have nothing to do with what's being taught here now, or maybe was ever taught here, or ever will be taught here.

43:05.106 --> 43:08.811
We have wonderful holdings, for example, of

43:10.765 --> 43:19.953
Dutch emblem books and Dutch drama of the 17th and 18th centuries.

43:20.254 --> 43:22.215
And Dutch hasn't been taught here for 50 years.

43:22.456 --> 43:23.817
But then again, it's research.

43:23.977 --> 43:27.060
It doesn't necessarily have to be taught here.

43:27.480 --> 43:33.446
Yeah, you're sometimes supporting the research of scholars from other institutions rather than your own.

43:33.506 --> 43:34.987
As often as not, perhaps.

43:35.007 --> 43:38.250
I know someone we haven't talked about.

43:38.430 --> 43:40.232
Shaffner, Joseph Shaffner.

43:40.465 --> 43:49.794
S-G-H-A-F-F-N-E-R of Hart Schaffner Marx.

43:50.674 --> 43:51.515
I got the connection.

43:53.957 --> 44:08.751
He collected History of Science, among other things, and gave his History of Science collection here, both books and manuscripts.

44:09.608 --> 44:10.669
Madame Curie.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.010
There's Madame Curie.

44:12.050 --> 44:18.696
Now, without a... Well, you must have some of the Madame Curie things there, I would think.

44:21.338 --> 44:22.579
This would be the place.

44:22.779 --> 44:29.645
Without an inventory, I don't know what to dip into to find what here, except this I can see sticking out.

44:35.931 --> 44:36.672
Oh, look at that.

44:37.873 --> 44:38.333
Well, that's...

44:38.735 --> 44:42.038
It's a Newton Autograph Manuscript, but it's A Count of Charges in the Mint.

44:42.058 --> 44:43.319
That's not very exciting.

44:43.900 --> 44:44.501
Well, it's still.

44:45.582 --> 44:58.934
It's holographic, right?

44:58.954 --> 45:01.577
Newton begins a dictionary of Latin tags.

45:07.022 --> 45:08.083
Look out, look out.

45:10.156 --> 45:10.797
How tight?

45:10.817 --> 45:11.658
Oh, my God, huh?

45:11.718 --> 45:13.761
That's a major manuscript, isn't it?

45:13.781 --> 45:13.942
Yeah.

45:16.926 --> 45:18.468
Does that get you a little nervous to handle that?

45:18.549 --> 45:18.769
Yes.

45:19.871 --> 45:20.652
I'm just going to touch it.

45:21.112 --> 45:22.174
Just a little touch.

45:22.214 --> 45:23.115
What kind of paper is that?

45:23.135 --> 45:24.017
Is that rag, do you think?

45:24.357 --> 45:26.641
Yeah, yeah, it surely would be at that in this period.

45:27.121 --> 45:27.923
Isaac Newton.

45:28.383 --> 45:30.086
And this is Sir Isaac Newton.

45:30.106 --> 45:31.628
Let me just write that down, okay.

45:32.389 --> 45:33.130
What are we looking at?

45:33.691 --> 45:34.172
What is it?

45:35.030 --> 45:39.334
It doesn't look like this is dated.

45:39.735 --> 45:43.418
It's a holograph manuscript written on five folio pages.

45:43.458 --> 45:47.002
Newton begins a dictionary of Latin tags.

45:47.903 --> 45:48.323
Tags.

45:48.984 --> 45:50.265
T-A-G-S, right?

45:50.766 --> 45:54.349
The first entry is abate.

45:56.551 --> 45:57.993
And the last is conduct.

45:58.914 --> 46:03.298
Rarely does Newton give an English version, as in the conduct quotation, but there's a fascinating

46:03.751 --> 46:09.198
aside to the compass quotation, which suggests the compass still used to achieve the correct spacing of the guard.

46:10.139 --> 46:11.681
C-O-M-P-A-S-S, compass.

46:13.684 --> 46:17.709
And that was part of the Portsmouth papers, that manuscript was part of the Portsmouth papers.

46:18.170 --> 46:19.351
You're supposed to be broken up, I guess.

46:19.371 --> 46:21.013
You must have been, yeah.

46:21.033 --> 46:21.454
Too bad.

46:21.494 --> 46:27.522
That's a case where maybe... I think that's fine, Sam.

46:27.822 --> 46:32.408
And he, uh, this came to the university about when, would you say?

46:33.232 --> 46:38.760
Must have been in the... Must have been in the 60s sometime.

46:38.860 --> 46:40.382
I need to check on that for you.

46:40.422 --> 46:41.063
Again, not now.

46:41.083 --> 46:44.629
You don't have to do that today.

46:44.649 --> 46:51.418
Do we... This is a vault.

46:51.438 --> 46:53.381
Does it have a name or is it just a treasure vault?

46:53.542 --> 46:54.483
Just the vault.

46:54.503 --> 46:55.524
And this is the vault.

46:55.825 --> 46:56.145
Right.

46:59.831 --> 47:01.433
Somebody's scabbard is up there.

47:02.611 --> 47:05.375
Yeah, I don't want the stories behind it.

47:06.517 --> 47:10.183
Some of the weirdest things end up in places like this.

47:10.223 --> 47:19.258
There's a whole collection here of Napoleonic stuff.

47:20.780 --> 47:22.944
They've got some Napoleonic stuff at the Newbury, too.

47:23.004 --> 47:24.466
That's stuff, yeah.

47:24.486 --> 47:29.935
Yeah, you know, very memento mori.

47:31.535 --> 47:33.278
That's bizarre.

47:33.779 --> 47:34.040
Yes.

47:34.080 --> 47:39.511
Somewhere in here there's a locket with a lock of his hair in it.

47:39.591 --> 47:40.893
Macaulian's hair.

47:40.973 --> 47:47.907
I'll pass on touching it.

47:52.004 --> 47:58.392
I suspect this was one of those cases where they accepted all this stuff in order to get something else.

47:58.572 --> 47:59.454
That happens everywhere.

47:59.474 --> 48:06.022
In Texas, I have to say, poor Texas does get static for getting things that we're walking by.

48:06.803 --> 48:09.086
This looks like it belongs over at the wing, doesn't it?

48:09.106 --> 48:09.467
Yeah.

48:09.487 --> 48:10.728
I don't know.

48:10.748 --> 48:12.991
I'm not sure what the story is and how we got this.

48:13.832 --> 48:14.894
Unfortunately, it's not used.

48:14.914 --> 48:16.616
Yeah, let's pass on it.

48:16.636 --> 48:18.879
This is Lincoln Pie Safe.

48:18.899 --> 48:19.179
Yes.

48:20.140 --> 48:20.661
From...

48:21.097 --> 48:25.544
Kitchen safe built by Lincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln, and used in his Illinois home.

48:25.824 --> 48:27.507
This came with the garden stuff.

48:28.448 --> 48:29.350
And here it stands.

48:29.550 --> 48:31.473
Here it stands, yes.

48:31.833 --> 48:40.487
I think they got an inquiry a year or so ago from someone who does... Refinishing?

48:40.527 --> 48:41.048
No, no.

48:41.088 --> 48:49.180
Who does these kits, you know, plans for building furniture that are authentic replicas of this or that, and wanted to do this.

48:49.615 --> 48:57.988
Well, if you want to sell them, you can probably... This is an incredible collection.

48:58.188 --> 49:00.271
These are war posters from the First World War.

49:00.291 --> 49:02.835
Lithographs, too, I would say.

49:02.855 --> 49:03.957
Lithographic posters.

49:06.260 --> 49:07.362
I don't like the way that sounds.

49:07.402 --> 49:11.528
It sounds like you're sticking back there.

49:11.548 --> 49:12.569
I'm going to leave that one alone.

49:15.293 --> 49:16.315
Law, not war.

49:17.611 --> 49:22.416
There's a wonderful book published last year in 1984 about World War I posters by Abbeville.

49:22.957 --> 49:23.518
Nice book.

49:24.599 --> 49:27.142
We did a wonderful show of this some years ago.

49:27.162 --> 49:28.463
I bet it was dramatic.

49:32.088 --> 49:41.859
This is really massive.

49:41.959 --> 49:47.365
It has to be massive because the university archives are here as well as the book of Abraham.

49:48.475 --> 49:51.138
Yes, he keeps popping up all over the place.

49:51.939 --> 49:52.700
As well he should.

49:58.107 --> 50:00.530
Someone must have presented this at the University at some point.

50:00.550 --> 50:01.071
It's nice.

50:01.091 --> 50:05.517
It's signed, and we'll have some.

50:05.677 --> 50:07.960
This is a wonderful little collide.

50:08.100 --> 50:09.362
Well, I say little.

50:09.422 --> 50:11.344
It's about 1700, 1800.

50:11.712 --> 50:19.003
volumes, little German almanacs and gift books from late 18th and first half of the 19th century.

50:19.023 --> 50:22.929
That is an example of the kind of thing a university would never go out and collect on its own.

50:23.610 --> 50:25.272
Somebody has to collect that and give it to you.

50:25.453 --> 50:25.673
Right.

50:27.195 --> 50:29.118
Actually, this was bought.

50:29.379 --> 50:29.659
Really?

50:29.920 --> 50:33.425
It came mostly from two different sources.

50:33.585 --> 50:35.027
But you bought it as a collection, though.

50:35.187 --> 50:36.149
Yeah.

50:37.231 --> 50:37.551
Yeah.

50:38.847 --> 50:48.799
And I feel a particular attachment to this collection because we had a volunteer who was in his 90s who finally retired and wanted a project to work on.

50:49.400 --> 50:53.885
And so Bob Rosenthal and I thought, now what can we have this guy work on?

50:53.985 --> 51:03.497
Well, he was a German immigrant from the 30s who loved books and loved art and so on.

51:03.517 --> 51:06.981
And we thought, we'll have him do a checklist

51:07.366 --> 51:23.468
of the of the almanac collection because you know it was catalogued but only as titles so this fellow spent three years coming in every day and going through volume by volume and

51:24.410 --> 51:29.518
looking and seeing, you know, who are the authors that are represented here?

51:30.679 --> 51:33.624
What are the genres that are represented?

51:33.664 --> 51:36.829
You know, are there short stories, are there... Well, he did a wonderful job.

51:37.390 --> 51:38.832
Yeah, and he had a great time doing it.

51:38.952 --> 51:39.733
Remember his name?

51:39.753 --> 51:41.276
Yeah, Bertolt Regensteiner.

51:41.756 --> 51:43.419
Bertolt Regensteiner.

51:43.839 --> 51:46.143
Like the name of the library, but with an E-R on the end of it.

51:47.205 --> 51:49.528
What are the illustrations?

51:49.628 --> 51:51.010
Who are the artists?

51:51.050 --> 51:52.132
Who are the engravers?

51:52.232 --> 51:52.813
And so on.

51:53.283 --> 51:56.789
We still don't have the final product.

51:56.829 --> 52:19.645
We put everything that he did on the computer and are using that to produce indices of artists and authors and editors and so on so that someone who's working on a specific artist or working on a specific author can find out where

52:19.979 --> 52:22.503
where things are in this collection.

52:22.543 --> 52:25.487
What does the collection tell you?

52:25.687 --> 52:31.956
What does the study of this material, what would you use it for?

52:31.976 --> 52:49.260
Well, it's fascinating, for example, from the standpoint of sociology of reading, because this genre was at its heyday in the late 18th, early 19th century, when there was a whole new class of readers in Germany.

52:49.679 --> 52:55.246
particularly women, middle-class women were learning to read.

52:55.326 --> 52:57.709
And so there was a demand for reading material.

52:57.769 --> 53:07.901
And so you have all these things named Minerva and Penelope and Rosa and... That's nice.

53:07.921 --> 53:09.202
We've covered a lot of ground, by the way.

53:10.864 --> 53:14.969
It seems pretty superficial in a way.

53:14.989 --> 53:18.994
There's one more thing I've got to show you because I thought at this time you mentioned...

53:19.733 --> 53:20.875
Phillips, Thomas Phillips.

53:21.275 --> 53:22.257
Oh, yeah.

53:22.277 --> 53:31.971
Because last, a couple years ago, when there were still Phillips things being sold off, um... Trust me, it's not superficial.

53:32.232 --> 53:34.455
It was because I'm writing stories, you know?

53:35.156 --> 53:41.465
This is not, I'm not doing the... This is as big as I've seen, I gotta tell you.

53:41.626 --> 53:49.217
A few years ago, when Krause was selling off Phillips things that he had bought, the fancy stuff wasn't

53:49.906 --> 53:50.987
what we were interested in.

53:52.129 --> 53:57.436
We bought this large collection of Venetian notarial documents.

53:57.476 --> 54:00.620
It's called the Rosenthal collection.

54:02.262 --> 54:17.601
Sam and Marie Louise Rosenthal, who are collectors who live on the North Shore, and who've been very generous to the library over the years, mostly in funds, not in terms of giving things from their collection.

54:19.336 --> 54:21.740
And who are particularly interested in Italian materials.

54:22.300 --> 54:35.280
And so when Bob Rosenthal, no relation, decided to buy this, he went to the director of the library and said, how would it be if we use some of the Rosenthal money for this and then name it after them?

54:35.300 --> 54:35.760
Oh, that's nice.

54:36.061 --> 54:37.363
And this is all Philip's stuff?

54:37.823 --> 54:39.586
This is all Philip's stuff.

54:39.606 --> 54:40.868
That guy was something, wasn't he?

54:41.469 --> 54:43.932
Actually, why don't we, let's, there's no place to look at it.

54:44.053 --> 54:44.874
All right.

54:44.894 --> 54:46.356
I'd love to see some Philip's stuff.

54:49.306 --> 54:57.480
In terms of the three-thirds interest, it's great.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.121
Look at this.

55:01.787 --> 55:08.438
These are documents by Italian notaries, marriage contracts, property transactions, and so on.

55:08.478 --> 55:10.421
Look at the calligraphy, though.

55:10.441 --> 55:15.870
Yeah, well, each notary had his own mark like this.

55:17.167 --> 55:24.199
And so a lot of these documents are related to each other, so you can follow a family through several centuries.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.870
So it's great for historical topics.

55:30.890 --> 55:41.368
It's also just a good thing for young historians to cut their eye teeth on in terms of learning to read scripts of the period and so on.

55:42.023 --> 55:43.244
Very, very useful.

55:43.324 --> 55:44.946
And you probably didn't have to pay a lot of money for it.

55:45.126 --> 55:45.766
No, no.

55:45.786 --> 55:48.509
I don't remember what we paid, but it was quite reasonable.

55:50.851 --> 56:04.664
Bob Rosenthal was so good at how he would orchestrate this kind of thing, because when the boxes came in, he said, now let's open one box, but then let's not open the others.

56:04.844 --> 56:11.490
We're going to bring in Sam and Marie Louise, and we're going to bring in

56:11.639 --> 56:20.680
Jules Kirshner and Eric Cochran from the History Department and a handful of their students, and we'll have a ceremonial opening with a little wine to drink afterwards.

56:21.061 --> 56:28.939
But when we're opening things up, Jules and Eric are immediately going to start

56:29.273 --> 56:34.120
talking about how historically significant this is and how wonderful it is that we've got them.

56:34.140 --> 56:40.169
And he said, Sam and Marie Louise will feel good, as they should, and they'll see a connection.

56:40.489 --> 56:42.372
Sam and Marie Louise Rosenthal.

56:42.652 --> 56:42.893
Right.

56:42.913 --> 56:44.896
Who I interviewed yesterday, by the way.

56:44.916 --> 56:45.316
Did you?

56:45.677 --> 56:45.757
Yes.

56:50.283 --> 56:51.225
I should point that out.

56:55.070 --> 56:57.294
So they gave the money for this?

56:57.374 --> 56:58.335
Yeah.

57:01.167 --> 57:06.655
We talked about what's going to happen to the collection.

57:07.256 --> 57:11.682
I would think that they might have some problems because of having loyalties to more than one institution.

57:11.742 --> 57:12.483
It's a problem.

57:13.345 --> 57:15.147
But I think he wants to be very fair about it.

57:15.608 --> 57:16.930
And you can't ask for more than that.

57:16.950 --> 57:17.170
Yeah.

57:19.834 --> 57:20.755
Yeah, that was nice.

57:20.795 --> 57:27.024
They're a very nice couple.

57:27.265 --> 57:27.525
Yeah.

57:27.545 --> 57:29.588
I'm going to shut the...

57:29.905 --> 57:30.846
You're a winner of the book.

57:31.167 --> 57:33.690
Right, and the freshman... He's collecting the book off.

57:33.710 --> 57:38.577
Right, and the freshman was collecting some science fiction author that I had never heard of before.

57:38.597 --> 57:41.981
That is a twist on it, the senior.

57:43.363 --> 57:45.506
Do I have to write any of this stuff down, or are you going to remember?

57:45.526 --> 57:47.229
I can get it to you.

57:47.249 --> 57:48.390
And you've got my address?

57:48.731 --> 57:49.251
Maybe not.

57:49.271 --> 57:49.912
I don't think so.

57:50.433 --> 57:51.134
Give me that.

57:51.154 --> 57:52.195
I don't have a paragraph.

57:53.016 --> 57:54.258
Chicago mentality.

57:55.280 --> 57:59.305
These self-made men who...

58:01.563 --> 58:08.694
Yeah, they were industrialists or whatever, but, you know, they wanted to make sure that people knew they had a certain eastern polish, too.

58:09.335 --> 58:18.269
Well, you know, it's very interesting, and Paul said this yesterday, there was a feeling here that this was going to be the biggest, most significant city in North America.

58:18.569 --> 58:19.711
Yeah, I think they believed that.

58:19.991 --> 58:28.104
It was doubling in size, and that's what would have knocked me over, the Newbury was its size.

58:28.204 --> 58:29.005
Yeah, yeah.

58:29.187 --> 58:34.216
I'm used to little John Carter Browns, and that's much larger than the Houghton.

58:34.236 --> 58:37.341
Of course, it's not the size of the Widener, but that's a whole other ballgame.

58:37.842 --> 58:40.006
And all these things were happening at the same time.

58:40.066 --> 58:52.748
I mean, the 1890s, you have the Newberry and Carrar bequests, you have the founding of the University of Chicago, you have the founding of the Art Institute, you have the founding of the Chicago Symphony, you have...

58:52.964 --> 58:54.386
This is a way into it, you know.

58:54.546 --> 59:13.091
You have the World's Columbian Exposition, which was, I don't know which way you came from downtown, but straight out from here on the lake is the Museum of Science and Industry, which is in the last surviving building from the World's Columbian Exposition, which was on the lakefront.

59:15.615 --> 59:18.178
Is it true that, I'll just put this on the other side.
