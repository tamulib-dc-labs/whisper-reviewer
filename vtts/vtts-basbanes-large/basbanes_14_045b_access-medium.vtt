WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:31.168
... ... ...

00:31.756 --> 00:38.985
I think I'll try it.

00:39.005 --> 00:50.000
If I get up tonight, I'll try that other restaurant you mentioned last night.

00:50.020 --> 00:50.120
Yeah.

00:50.140 --> 00:51.121
Wait, what?

00:51.141 --> 00:51.221
D&D.

00:51.241 --> 00:51.722
D&D is this dish, right?

00:51.742 --> 00:51.842
Yeah.

00:51.862 --> 00:52.583
I can get this to the home.

00:54.115 --> 01:22.502
That's all that he thought, thanks to the... ... ... ... ... ... ...

01:22.482 --> 01:34.078
So,

01:36.978 --> 02:03.407
What other places do you go to around here?

02:04.703 --> 02:23.411
You go to other places, other places you go to.

02:23.431 --> 02:25.314
Yeah, in Chainsbury, about 60 miles away, in the Redfin Park, painting the island of the hill.

02:25.334 --> 02:25.534
Very good.

02:25.554 --> 02:25.935
Also ancient sites.

02:28.885 --> 02:43.940
Another one, Tardis, Tardis, now there are a million chapters.

02:43.960 --> 02:44.642
It's about six months, six months.

02:44.662 --> 02:45.223
Uriana and Tidima are little

02:45.203 --> 03:05.555
Oh, amazing.

03:05.575 --> 03:06.336
And how we can access you to maintain?

03:06.356 --> 03:07.077
Yes, around the hundred fifty miles.

03:08.626 --> 03:29.723
I bet you have to leave very early.

03:29.703 --> 03:50.673
This is the roadside.

03:50.693 --> 03:51.154
This is a big hospital.

03:54.475 --> 04:24.166
.

04:24.186 --> 04:24.206
.

04:24.226 --> 04:24.246
.

04:24.226 --> 04:53.301
Thank you.

04:53.321 --> 04:53.521
Thank you.

04:53.541 --> 04:53.741
Thank you.

04:53.762 --> 04:53.962
Thank you.

04:53.982 --> 04:54.182
Thank you.

04:54.162 --> 05:21.503
... ... ... ... ...

05:21.483 --> 05:51.005
.

05:51.025 --> 05:51.045
.

05:51.065 --> 05:51.085
.

05:51.065 --> 06:13.562
Thank you.

06:13.582 --> 06:13.782
Thank you.

06:13.762 --> 06:41.150
I'm going to go.

06:41.170 --> 06:41.490
I'm going to go.

06:41.470 --> 07:06.972
... ... ... ... ... ...

07:06.952 --> 07:23.745
It's called Neanderthal.

07:24.535 --> 07:41.369
So how did I get the name?

07:41.389 --> 07:42.090
How did that name become so famous?

07:42.110 --> 07:42.311
Meanderer?

07:42.331 --> 07:42.972
Yeah, when they said, Meanderer.

07:42.992 --> 07:44.535
So the river is Meanderer, because it's Monday, it makes me, Meanderer River.

07:44.515 --> 07:56.469
I love it how words work.

08:00.814 --> 08:05.680
That's just exactly what we were talking about yesterday.

08:05.700 --> 08:10.185
You said how words like that don't go into Arabic.

08:10.205 --> 08:12.588
But words like that come into English all the time.

08:12.608 --> 08:12.868
All the time.

08:12.848 --> 08:30.434
You know, I mean, I can't even think of some of them, but it's almost like a metaphor, you know.

08:30.454 --> 08:31.215
It depends.

08:32.718 --> 08:34.841
It is wonderful, like that, because it admits, it admits, and when I do it, it does.

08:34.861 --> 08:35.582
It doesn't accept that.

08:36.237 --> 08:58.030
Yeah, that's right.

08:58.050 --> 08:58.430
Yeah, that's right.

08:58.451 --> 08:59.132
Do you want to see your companion?

08:59.152 --> 09:00.033
I want to see if you want to see that thing.

09:00.053 --> 09:00.734
Do you want to see your companion?

09:00.754 --> 09:01.435
Do you want to see your companion?

09:02.275 --> 09:27.174
Well, so why don't I go to Egypt?

09:27.194 --> 09:27.855
Three days there, then to Greece.

09:27.875 --> 09:28.696
We're going to Mount Jaffa for four days.

09:28.716 --> 09:29.177
Five days, four nights.

09:30.794 --> 09:45.508
Yeah, well that's the one that, that's the big article, the magazine one.

09:45.948 --> 09:51.994
They haven't done an article on this ever, you know, a particular magazine.

09:52.375 --> 09:58.000
And then I leave from, that's no, I need this to Athens one night, to Athens, and back on Friday the 6th.

09:58.688 --> 10:18.092
So a week from this Friday, I'll come home.

10:18.112 --> 10:21.457
Time goes very quickly in the morning.

10:21.477 --> 10:23.099
As soon as I get back, I have to go to New York City.

10:23.119 --> 10:23.459
I get back a lot.

10:23.479 --> 10:24.240
So I'll have that Saturday and Sunday.

10:25.283 --> 10:27.168
Catch up on the jet lag.

10:27.950 --> 10:29.654
And then I'll drive down on Monday.

10:29.674 --> 10:31.599
My wife will come down with me.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.101
Three hours.

10:32.121 --> 10:32.662
Three hours.

10:32.803 --> 10:33.244
Do my work.

10:33.324 --> 10:34.226
Three hours back.

10:34.246 --> 10:35.469
And come back the same day.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.322
Then I've got to write that story.

10:41.888 --> 10:47.156
I've got a couple of articles.

10:47.817 --> 10:53.105
I've picked it as a magazine that's done very well because it's incredible.

10:53.125 --> 10:53.526
Terrific.

10:53.546 --> 10:53.986
Terrific.

10:54.247 --> 10:55.108
I don't know where I can write it.

10:55.128 --> 10:55.889
It'll be beautiful.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.814
For a travel magazine, too.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.036
Perfect.

11:00.176 --> 11:04.302
And they only will like about 1,200 to 1,500 words.

11:04.282 --> 11:27.285
Before you know it, it's Christmas.

11:27.839 --> 11:35.082
I knew a couple of good stories for the holidays.

11:35.416 --> 11:35.977
on books.

11:36.217 --> 11:46.993
I write about books, so books for holiday games.

11:47.013 --> 11:48.495
Yeah, the gift books.

11:48.515 --> 11:53.282
They send me all the books, and they publish it.

11:53.302 --> 11:59.010
There's one beautiful book on Turkey, I've heard of it, Aerial Views of Turkey, and it's so intriguing.

11:58.990 --> 12:16.647
You can see the city in the background.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.790
But I didn't do the city justice.

12:19.810 --> 12:20.451
I think the city wasn't.

12:20.471 --> 12:21.492
It just looked like a city from the end.

12:21.512 --> 12:23.754
And I think when you see it, it's a very charming little city.

12:23.774 --> 12:25.796
Just like that one you took me through this morning was very charming.

12:25.816 --> 12:26.456
I thought it was a village.

12:26.476 --> 12:26.616
Really?

12:26.636 --> 12:26.737
Yeah.

12:26.757 --> 12:28.238
Well, they seem to make their money on tourism, though.

12:28.538 --> 12:48.882
They were ready today.

12:48.902 --> 12:49.723
They were selling the bottles of the pot.

12:49.743 --> 12:50.344
And they make that themselves.

12:50.898 --> 13:13.311
So, I'm going to take a look at this.

13:13.291 --> 13:40.635
Twenty-four people, that's what you say.

13:40.655 --> 13:41.676
Twenty-four people, there's one small bus probably.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.657
Well, I recommend this, the way you and I do it.

13:43.379 --> 14:01.155
Because I'm very customized to give me what I want, you know.

14:01.175 --> 14:01.656
Bang, bang, bang, right?

14:01.676 --> 14:02.578
Everybody can see that.

14:02.598 --> 14:05.303
If I get a story on this, I'll mention your name in the seat.

14:06.194 --> 14:11.323
You do that in my car.

14:11.423 --> 14:23.243
I do, and I'm going to make sure you can.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.746
You gave it to me.

14:24.766 --> 14:25.708
Sometimes around the hotel room.

14:27.010 --> 14:27.811
That's a pretty good idea.

14:28.793 --> 14:31.257
It's a very good idea.

14:31.844 --> 14:52.013
The material design is for whatever they need.

14:51.993 --> 15:16.127
Yes, what do you have him to do?

15:16.681 --> 15:33.394
That helps, too.

15:33.414 --> 15:34.496
I'm going to have some contact with you.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.057
I'll tell you what you say.

15:35.077 --> 15:35.618
I'll tell you what you say.

15:35.598 --> 15:56.564
I guess when we were up in Pergamon, to me that was a smoke place.

15:56.584 --> 15:58.767
It actually wasn't Pergamon, no.

15:58.787 --> 15:58.967
That was.

15:58.987 --> 16:00.129
It happened up on Necropolis when I got in West Pergamon.

16:00.149 --> 16:00.830
So I walked up there.

16:00.850 --> 16:01.431
I just walked up to the park.

16:01.451 --> 16:01.791
Walked some more.

16:02.007 --> 16:12.224
It was a woman.

16:12.244 --> 16:12.625
I was just a woman.

16:13.432 --> 16:16.095
trivial.

16:17.536 --> 16:30.508
And I remember what it was that Jesus showed me.

16:31.229 --> 16:32.711
And I said, how do you stand that?

16:32.731 --> 16:34.032
Take the spotlight to the sun that you've heard.

16:34.052 --> 16:36.835
It was the temple that was receiving the rays of the sun and the shadows of the sun.

16:36.855 --> 16:40.138
Remember, the late afternoon of the sun, like in the audience, an audience will wait all day.

16:40.158 --> 16:41.159
I said, an audience will wait all day.

16:41.179 --> 16:42.460
You see, that person's light is coming to the center of the sun.

16:42.440 --> 16:53.154
It couldn't have been better.

16:53.174 --> 17:00.324
And she was babbling on about something back home with a friend, and it was totally, uh, insensitive to it.

17:00.344 --> 17:03.268
And I noticed somebody was going, you know, never worth 20 years to me.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.772
I mean, how often do you get to stand here?

17:07.033 --> 17:08.835
Yeah, I was very, very moved by that.

17:09.288 --> 17:22.752
You'd love to know what they're—it's going to be more than what you've done there.

17:22.772 --> 17:23.173
There's a huge bond.

17:23.193 --> 17:23.794
There's a huge individual.

17:23.814 --> 17:24.174
There's a crystal.

17:24.195 --> 17:24.495
It's all there.

17:24.475 --> 17:37.475
You know, there is a historian that I know of.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.199
When he gets to the written book, he talks about war, such warfare historians.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.526
And he just wrote a little about how certain places would be amazed at how many times great battles, great conflicts, and you know,

17:44.506 --> 17:45.868
What?

17:46.228 --> 17:47.730
Why is that?

17:47.850 --> 17:58.565
What is there about a certain piece of geography that is like, you know, the pro-relations?

17:59.446 --> 18:00.687
Yeah.

18:00.707 --> 18:06.415
There's going to be something about that plot that really resonates with people.

18:06.435 --> 18:07.436
I don't know.

18:07.456 --> 18:08.438
I'm even so sure they can express it.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.659
There's something about that plot.

18:09.679 --> 18:11.321
I mean, it's just too striking a coincidence.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.704
I mean, there are plenty of places around here where they could have built it.

18:13.724 --> 18:14.125
Why all this?

18:14.729 --> 18:36.993
And then they connect it to themselves by a walk.

18:37.013 --> 18:38.294
I know you've mentioned that there's this train economic spirit.

18:38.314 --> 18:39.235
And I'm sure that there's a lot to do with it.

18:39.255 --> 18:43.099
The water is free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free.

18:43.079 --> 18:53.656
Now, you can have books that I'm writing now, and I've already written a book that you can see.

18:53.676 --> 18:55.399
But you can see it, and it's a stretcher, I can put, and he formed it in World War II.

18:55.419 --> 18:55.860
But follow, I'm sorry.

18:55.880 --> 18:56.481
But what are you going to do?

18:56.501 --> 19:09.542
I'm going to do the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the air and the

19:09.522 --> 19:33.931
That's correct.

19:33.951 --> 19:34.291
It's a bad fight.

19:34.311 --> 19:34.832
That fight is so fighting.

19:34.852 --> 19:36.494
That was the fourth time, fourth time in history, in that case, there was a force.

19:36.514 --> 19:37.015
Dorothy's doing it on it.

19:37.035 --> 19:37.355
He destroyed it.

19:37.375 --> 19:37.916
Somebody else destroyed it.

19:37.936 --> 19:38.196
So, that's...

19:38.918 --> 19:43.428
But if you see that Monte Cassino, it's like Pergolus, Chaius.

19:43.449 --> 19:50.625
And it really does control that Lira, L-I-A-R-E, that Lira Baton Valley.

19:50.645 --> 19:51.848
If you're going to Rome,

19:52.705 --> 20:08.985
You've got to pass through.

20:09.005 --> 20:09.606
It totally controls that path.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.187
Sometimes it's so beautiful.

20:10.207 --> 20:10.428
It's great.

20:10.448 --> 20:10.849
But you get through.

20:11.116 --> 20:23.875
And after we bombed it, and it was in February, it didn't fall, a lot of the Germans defended it to May.

20:23.895 --> 20:29.364
It was March, April, May, and then they left them.

20:29.384 --> 20:33.109
And finally, yeah, even after the Germans moved all their troops there, now they didn't have to have to pretend to do it.

20:33.129 --> 20:37.596
Well, they destroyed the troops weren't in there, but they were using a troop squadron that had ammunition under their troops, and they were defending them out.

20:37.576 --> 20:41.511
And I'm getting into this in the book, so why am I getting into this?

20:41.531 --> 20:42.540
Because the book survives.

20:43.010 --> 20:50.618
And, I mean, for all of us, the books take it.

20:50.658 --> 20:54.963
They took the books out, and they put them in the Vatican.

20:54.983 --> 20:59.408
It was fragile, little pieces of paper.

20:59.428 --> 21:03.272
That's why I got very excited this morning.

21:03.292 --> 21:08.157
I really, except when you told me there was a papyrus hiding.

21:08.491 --> 21:27.279
And then, I'd love to find out more about that.

21:27.299 --> 21:30.083
You don't tell any of a story that hasn't been written about either.

21:30.964 --> 21:31.625
So I'll ask your friends.

21:31.645 --> 21:31.866
Yeah, yeah.

21:31.886 --> 21:32.286
Both I can help you.

21:32.306 --> 21:32.406
Okay.

21:32.427 --> 21:33.007
You get email with me, right?

21:33.027 --> 21:33.708
Yeah, I contact somebody else.

21:33.728 --> 21:36.152
Yeah, I need to know a little bit more about what year I was found.

21:36.132 --> 21:45.841
how it was formed, where it was formed, what were they looking for?

21:45.861 --> 21:48.984
What have they studied?

21:49.004 --> 21:53.047
I think the significance of this is what are the papyrus scrolls.

21:53.428 --> 21:56.430
There's no papyrus scrolls that survive.

21:56.470 --> 22:01.375
The only ones that survive come out of Egypt because of the climate.

22:01.395 --> 22:06.139
Most papyrus, the only papyrus scrolls that are from Egypt that really survive, but you can't really meet them, are the ones at Pompeii.

22:06.608 --> 22:34.373
So it turned into volcanic fossils, but you can't stand.

22:34.393 --> 22:35.754
But otherwise, the only one just goes out of the water is the water.

22:35.774 --> 22:36.615
And they have it here in the vault, right?

22:36.595 --> 22:44.476
You've got a reason to come down.

22:44.497 --> 22:44.597
Yeah.

22:45.117 --> 23:06.016
You don't see the unique concepts that are really in the United States to go and move it.

23:06.036 --> 23:06.756
I don't believe it's a new strategy.

23:06.776 --> 23:07.137
I really see this.

23:07.157 --> 23:07.577
It's a different way.

23:07.597 --> 23:08.017
It's a different way.

23:08.037 --> 23:08.458
It's a different way.

23:08.478 --> 23:08.898
It's a different way.

23:08.918 --> 23:09.338
It's a different way.

23:09.359 --> 23:09.779
It's a different way.

23:09.799 --> 23:10.219
It's a different way.

23:10.239 --> 23:10.660
It's a different way.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.100
It's a different way.

23:11.120 --> 23:11.540
It's a different way.

23:11.560 --> 23:11.981
It's a different way.

23:12.001 --> 23:12.421
It's a different way.

23:12.441 --> 23:12.862
It's a different way.

23:12.882 --> 23:13.302
It's a different way.

23:13.282 --> 23:40.437
The water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water.

23:41.260 --> 23:53.321
I don't want to go in there, but what is it?

23:53.341 --> 23:53.681
It's right there.

23:53.701 --> 23:55.084
It's somewhere next to our audience, trying to figure out what to do.

23:55.104 --> 23:56.907
I mean, if they're not so locked and locked up somewhere else in place, they are trying to

23:56.887 --> 24:12.308
Now, what's that sort of site that we have for?

24:12.328 --> 24:12.748
Is it a type of site?

24:12.768 --> 24:13.369
No, it's quite a type of site.

24:13.389 --> 24:13.950
It's sort of even a mystery.

24:13.970 --> 24:14.991
Also, they have fun to be eating with local people.

24:15.011 --> 24:16.313
For example, for other people, they always touch my local people.

24:16.293 --> 24:36.398
So it doesn't look like it's pretty interesting, right?

24:36.419 --> 24:36.879
Look at that one, yeah?

24:36.899 --> 24:37.360
It's a beautiful thing.

24:37.380 --> 24:37.840
It's a beautiful thing.

24:37.860 --> 24:38.321
It's a beautiful thing.

24:38.341 --> 24:38.802
It's a beautiful thing.

24:38.822 --> 24:39.282
It's a beautiful thing.

24:39.302 --> 24:39.763
It's a beautiful thing.

24:39.783 --> 24:40.243
It's a beautiful thing.

24:40.263 --> 24:40.724
It's a beautiful thing.

24:40.744 --> 24:41.205
It's a beautiful thing.

24:41.225 --> 24:41.685
It's a beautiful thing.

24:41.705 --> 24:42.166
It's a beautiful thing.

24:42.186 --> 24:42.646
It's a beautiful thing.

24:42.666 --> 24:43.127
It's a beautiful thing.

24:43.107 --> 25:06.769
But local people, the assurance, local people in Australia, the gentleman who made this experiment, he didn't look like he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than he'd better than that.

25:06.749 --> 25:28.611
It's been called... And there was this altar.

25:28.631 --> 25:29.533
I went to high school with a girl who was 16.

25:29.513 --> 25:45.365
This is a professor at Akita, in Canada, and also of the British.

25:45.385 --> 25:46.527
The Turkish Greek Empire is depicting the Ottoman Empire.

25:46.507 --> 26:10.481
I agree, cool.

26:10.501 --> 26:10.962
Except left hand trade.

26:11.448 --> 26:35.132
Even, for example, the Ruby elders in Mora, Mora-Penis, in the Greek, the mainland Greek, the army commander of the Greek, the Ottoman army commander of the Greek.

26:35.152 --> 26:36.173
And as their follow-up construction of the country,

26:36.558 --> 27:02.397
Well, let's just write it down.

27:02.680 --> 27:18.849
When I go to Harvard University, I get out of pocket care.

27:18.869 --> 27:19.290
And I can do nothing.

27:19.310 --> 27:19.851
I'll go play in the laptop.

27:19.871 --> 27:20.291
I'll do it right now.

27:20.312 --> 27:27.304
Now it's your turn.

27:28.027 --> 27:53.190
I'm constantly losing pens.

27:53.210 --> 27:53.630
I got one, I got one.

27:53.650 --> 27:54.331
That's why I buy these cheap pens.

27:54.351 --> 27:54.691
Good pens I lose.

27:54.711 --> 27:55.452
You know why I lose these cheap ones?

27:55.432 --> 28:20.376
This is very interesting.

28:20.356 --> 28:37.924
This is a Ukrainian.

28:37.944 --> 28:38.044
Okay.

28:42.412 --> 28:59.543
Man sollte auch ein bisschen verlaufen.

29:04.298 --> 29:28.838
Let's look at all the time.

29:28.818 --> 29:56.952
... ... ... ... ...

29:58.737 --> 30:17.016
Thank you.

30:19.004 --> 30:45.984
.

30:46.004 --> 30:46.024
.

30:48.940 --> 31:06.591
Come again.

31:06.611 --> 31:06.831
Come again.

31:09.950 --> 31:27.520
All right.

31:27.500 --> 31:46.065
I'm sorry.

31:46.085 --> 31:46.285
I'm sorry.

32:15.880 --> 32:24.473
Thank you.

33:14.335 --> 33:19.743
.

33:19.763 --> 33:19.783
.

33:19.803 --> 33:19.823
.

36:07.321 --> 36:33.092
Thank you for that.

37:13.370 --> 37:27.548
you know

37:47.727 --> 37:51.392
There's another one that's in the back of the board, yeah.

39:08.052 --> 39:11.025
.

46:24.305 --> 46:27.700
with a couple of their large thousands of our homes.

49:30.318 --> 50:00.139
What's your name going on in place?

50:00.608 --> 50:02.397
Yes.

50:03.724 --> 50:04.086
Municipality.

50:07.746 --> 50:08.610
Municipality.

50:35.050 --> 50:47.823
The Bible is written now in the Bible.

50:47.843 --> 50:49.387
And we stand down and preach this.

50:49.407 --> 50:49.768
Jesus is here now.

54:41.476 --> 55:09.023
.

55:09.043 --> 55:09.063
.

55:09.083 --> 55:09.103
.

55:11.277 --> 55:36.384
.

55:36.404 --> 55:36.424
.

57:04.525 --> 57:04.969
Mm-hmm.

01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:20.790
There's a lot of people over there.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:04:15.820
... ... ... ... ...

01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:41.865
You want to follow?

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:51.340
I want to thank you.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.374
Thank you.

01:12:37.038 --> 01:12:58.422
Can we put it in the spot?

01:15:53.058 --> 01:15:53.973
Thank you.

01:18:33.033 --> 01:18:37.390
Thank you.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:10.615
.

01:25:41.759 --> 01:26:05.505
There we go.

01:26:09.653 --> 01:26:33.841
I don't know.

01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:34.121
I don't know.

01:26:34.141 --> 01:26:34.402
I don't know.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:34.682
I don't know.

01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:41.517
Thank you.

01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:05.511
Thank you.
