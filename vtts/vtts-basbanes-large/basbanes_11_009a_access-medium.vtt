WEBVTT

00:04.840 --> 00:16.698
This is the catalogue room?

00:16.859 --> 00:18.501
Yes, for the printed books.

00:18.661 --> 00:19.383
Okay.

00:19.783 --> 00:21.606
So you still have printed books here?

00:21.626 --> 00:21.866
Yes.

00:22.087 --> 00:25.372
Even though most of them since the 18th century.

00:26.173 --> 00:29.739
But there you have the catalogue of the manuscripts.

00:29.839 --> 00:32.603
Here of the printed books because the library

00:32.583 --> 00:47.993
I had all the most important scientific goals to search because the idea is to have the manuscripts and then the instruments, the books, the search on the manuscripts.

00:48.496 --> 00:55.513
Here you have the new and handsome catalogue with the scientific works.

00:55.814 --> 00:58.781
Are you online yet on the computer?

00:59.263 --> 01:02.952
No, this is available.

01:03.373 --> 01:04.716
Now only for

01:04.696 --> 01:24.696
but it is the place for the future to have internet and also and with the whole also the

01:24.811 --> 01:29.699
The library, the national library system with... Together?

01:29.719 --> 01:30.921
Yes, excellent.

01:31.021 --> 01:33.485
Like in nationality.

01:33.545 --> 01:35.808
Who operates this library?

01:35.968 --> 01:37.130
Is this one by the government?

01:37.150 --> 01:40.275
Is this part of the... No, no, there is a public library.

01:40.295 --> 01:42.038
It's a public library.

01:42.058 --> 01:47.246
And it is public from the time of the opening in 1571.

01:47.466 --> 01:48.047
Really?

01:48.067 --> 01:48.248
Today.

01:48.969 --> 01:51.092
And it is the property of the state.

01:51.172 --> 01:52.995
Excellent.

01:53.701 --> 01:55.705
It's a public library, isn't it?

01:55.725 --> 01:58.510
Public, but only for readers, for scholars.

01:58.530 --> 01:59.111
Yes.

01:59.292 --> 01:59.953
But it's open.

02:00.794 --> 02:12.216
It's open to public, but you need the special lectures where you write the object of your search and also the stabbing department.

02:12.787 --> 02:22.370
but not for the university professors.

02:22.610 --> 02:29.226
The history of the library.

02:29.577 --> 02:31.421
Thank you.

02:32.603 --> 02:44.970
Thank you so much.

02:44.950 --> 02:59.108
You can just write down your name so I can thank you properly.

02:59.128 --> 03:05.777
I want to write down your name so I can thank you properly.

03:05.757 --> 03:32.220
I'll know me.

03:36.233 --> 03:43.366
Okay, very good.

03:43.587 --> 03:51.441
Thank you.

03:51.978 --> 04:05.978
Now we are going to make electricity, a new electricity, and they are stored for this.

04:06.479 --> 04:19.137
And also the restoration, for example, and the director role here is a new one.

04:19.417 --> 04:20.719
Absolutely.

04:20.699 --> 04:31.576
They are referring with the flash of the end of 18th century.

04:31.696 --> 04:40.851
And this is, it is referring to

04:40.831 --> 04:43.839
for the new system of security.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.626
Security, electrical, everything together.

04:46.646 --> 04:49.092
How old are these paintings on the wall, these murals?

04:49.633 --> 04:51.017
How old are they?

04:51.097 --> 04:53.684
It is of the end of 18th century.

04:53.704 --> 04:56.190
18th century.

04:56.272 --> 05:08.116
Allora, andiamo a vedere... No, no, ma questo è troppo disordinato, davvero, non è possibile.

05:09.238 --> 05:12.685
Ecco, e... non è una cosa interessante.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.914
Andiamo nel cuore di mostro.

05:16.994 --> 05:17.976
No, no, no, no.

05:20.943 --> 05:35.369
Now we're going to the laboratory for restoring the books.

05:36.090 --> 05:39.296
It's important.

05:39.436 --> 05:41.680
You do that right here, the restoration.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.385
We have your own facilities.

05:44.737 --> 05:48.022
who worked here in 1966.

05:48.062 --> 05:53.391
This was all designed by Michelangelo?

05:53.511 --> 06:03.167
No, no, this is designed by Michelangelo also but realised in the 15th century.

06:03.383 --> 06:05.145
Permesso?

06:05.746 --> 06:11.474
Allora, buongiorno.

06:11.494 --> 06:24.092
Sono questi giudicatori, questi sono i nostri bravissimi tecnici, questo professore ha scritto un articolo, ha scritto delle altre cose, eccetera.

06:24.072 --> 06:30.859
and comes to have an idea of the work of the library.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.023
We are a bit in confusion.

06:34.043 --> 06:38.227
But you can see a picture of the library?

06:38.347 --> 06:42.672
Yes, these are modern books.

06:42.752 --> 06:45.595
Yes, yes.

06:45.675 --> 06:50.400
And then we will go to the library.

06:51.157 --> 06:54.315
They're working on a manuscript right now.

06:54.667 --> 07:23.037
This is the whole page of this manuscript

07:23.489 --> 07:37.064
Not very good, and then you have full page, they can all that.

07:38.485 --> 07:45.753
If you don't want, it's okay.

07:45.793 --> 07:52.821
What's it, what's it?

07:53.459 --> 08:12.582
Because the librarians can say this in Greek, my name is Chris.

08:12.663 --> 08:28.613
has reconstructed all the pages, the one, the work, the special work for the librarian.

08:29.015 --> 08:47.225
How old is the revolution?

08:47.325 --> 08:54.938
Oh, this is the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

08:55.272 --> 09:22.596
We need the original order of the page and even if it's not corrected, the page one and then page three and then page four, it's a mess.

09:22.846 --> 09:29.055
He's collating it.

09:29.515 --> 09:30.557
How old is that binding?

09:30.697 --> 09:35.724
That's it, it's original.

09:36.685 --> 09:45.698
Of the end of the 16th century, by the time.

09:45.678 --> 09:48.040
That's amazing.

09:48.060 --> 09:52.885
So this library, you said from this library originally?

09:52.925 --> 09:56.288
The little book I did you.

09:56.308 --> 09:58.810
The little book I did.

09:59.531 --> 10:04.216
The little book I did.

10:04.256 --> 10:07.198
The book what?

10:07.679 --> 10:09.801
Oh, yes.

10:10.101 --> 10:13.985
We have the little book I... Dove?

10:14.005 --> 10:15.246
Where is it?

10:15.547 --> 10:20.314
Yes, I have it in there.

10:20.334 --> 10:22.177
She said the history is... Yes, I have it.

10:23.179 --> 10:24.120
All right.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.667
This book?

10:28.687 --> 10:30.790
Well, this book is in there?

10:30.850 --> 10:32.913
This book may be in here.

10:33.054 --> 10:33.474
I see.

10:33.554 --> 10:34.476
For you, yes.

10:34.496 --> 10:35.738
Thank you so much.

10:35.858 --> 10:42.448
All right.

10:42.631 --> 10:44.193
That's exciting.

10:44.374 --> 10:50.122
Yes, because you can see in this photograph how the books were stored at the opening of the library.

10:51.364 --> 10:58.255
Because you have the decks of the Granada by the Granada, and there are the enchanted books with the iron chain at that time.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.002
Let's get some of those.

11:06.307 --> 11:35.706
Page 12, it is one of the 3,000 manuscripts, original manuscripts of the library, page 12 and the brochure.

11:36.108 --> 12:03.689
Oh, you had an exposition in 1971 to commemorate the 400th anniversary.

12:03.709 --> 12:04.090
Wonderful.

12:04.390 --> 12:10.878
Must have been wonderful to talk about the 17th century.

12:11.238 --> 12:12.320
This is very helpful.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.021
Wonderful.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.162
Thank you.

12:14.302 --> 12:25.436
Do they have reproductions of the book for studies of scholars?

12:25.636 --> 12:27.238
Yes, it's possible.

12:27.258 --> 12:32.625
We have laboratories for

12:32.993 --> 12:37.660
The miniature is in color, or in black, in white and black.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.622
Yes.

12:38.642 --> 12:40.765
Nicky was going to do reproductions for study.

12:41.246 --> 12:42.187
Oh, good.

12:42.347 --> 12:47.475
Oh, yes.

12:47.876 --> 12:50.339
That's very important.

12:50.420 --> 12:50.900
Oh, Lord.

12:50.920 --> 12:55.047
We have the microfilm of all our manuscripts.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.771
All the manuscripts are on microfilm for study.

12:58.131 --> 12:58.672
Very good.

12:59.473 --> 13:00.455
That's extraordinary.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.937
It's right here in the book.

13:02.896 --> 13:07.903
This is pretty heavy.

13:08.304 --> 13:08.805
Right there.

13:08.865 --> 13:18.359
It's quite beautiful, breathtaking.

13:18.379 --> 13:22.324
You had a lot of the work yesterday.

13:22.444 --> 13:31.738
Yesterday was... Before the construction of the library,

13:32.157 --> 13:35.000
There were only these, the first cloister.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.584
Oh, so this was in addition to the library?

13:40.045 --> 13:42.006
Yes, Michelangelo.

13:42.107 --> 13:43.608
Yes, he did.

13:43.628 --> 13:49.594
This was the original up to that roof, and then Michelangelo made the library up to design.

13:51.135 --> 13:58.182
It's very, it is more than 45 meters.

13:58.415 --> 14:04.967
More than 45 meters long.

14:05.108 --> 14:13.965
The vertical part is ricetto or invaso.

14:15.287 --> 14:19.495
And that's enough for sure.

14:21.297 --> 14:34.797
It is the waiting moment before to enter in the salon where you have the collection of the manuscripts.

14:35.017 --> 14:43.930
The salon is there and you have the three closed windows, it is the festival.

14:44.365 --> 14:52.875
the ricetto or invaso, like in the Hanson Temple, you have the festival for waiting and then entering the sound.

14:52.895 --> 14:54.938
And that's where the three windows are boarded?

14:55.018 --> 14:55.439
Yes.

14:55.459 --> 15:00.004
That skylight up there, was that part of the original design?

15:00.024 --> 15:12.820
No, this is by, this is of the Sala Delci on the right, and Sala constructed open in 1841, but we can see after, but it is not.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.323
A lot of history is she pointed out.

15:17.345 --> 15:27.922
First edition classic, that's the only collection of Noah Knight.

15:28.042 --> 15:31.368
It's Pasquale Porciante.

15:31.608 --> 15:39.702
Design and consult at Tribune, next to Michelangelo's Menry in Rome.

15:39.952 --> 16:03.421
So, you're always constantly renovating with the electrical systems?

16:03.641 --> 16:04.542
Yes, yes.

16:04.724 --> 16:17.824
Madam has said because we have these works and then it is not so beautiful to see.

16:17.925 --> 16:28.842
There is an exhibition on Cathedral's book, the library of the cathedral.

16:29.403 --> 16:32.908
There is a story here between the Lord.

16:34.238 --> 16:51.838
This is the recheck.

16:51.858 --> 16:57.124
We have started my disease for restorating and controlling

16:57.779 --> 17:02.427
The sealant is of the end of the 18th century.

17:02.447 --> 17:03.990
The end of the 18th century?

17:04.010 --> 17:08.337
Yes, because Michelangelo has made it only just to the columns.

17:08.357 --> 17:10.681
You can see the Michelangelo's path.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.064
Michelangelo's?

17:12.324 --> 17:15.850
Yes, the columns and just to the columns.

17:16.672 --> 17:18.555
Because the windows are...

17:18.974 --> 17:22.062
of the end of the 19th century.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.469
This is Michelangelo.

17:25.331 --> 17:27.457
This is Michelangelo.

17:27.537 --> 17:34.215
Made it by Amman Nassim in 1959 but on design and on a little model

17:34.195 --> 17:38.099
by Mechangelo.

17:38.499 --> 17:39.340
Lost them.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.824
They have lost a little more than I lost them.

17:43.404 --> 17:55.496
And did they keep the books up there because they designed it because they were the books and kept?

17:55.516 --> 17:55.957
No, no.

17:55.977 --> 18:02.964
Because we have now, we have not the designs, but also at the time the Mechangelo has changed this little model.

18:02.984 --> 18:04.185
But,

18:04.486 --> 18:23.687
They are Michelangelo new and they can learn a collection for the books.

18:23.787 --> 18:32.957
This is the library of Michelangelo.

18:45.644 --> 19:10.591
Here.

19:10.611 --> 19:10.691
Wow.

19:10.711 --> 19:11.031
Underneath, yes.

19:11.051 --> 19:11.312
They changed.

19:11.332 --> 19:11.932
Changed close to the aircraft.

19:11.952 --> 19:12.013
Oh.

19:12.033 --> 19:12.453
And the endocathalas.

19:12.473 --> 19:12.753
I can't watch.

19:12.773 --> 19:13.554
I can't watch on the side of the bench.

19:13.574 --> 19:14.015
Because it would work.

19:14.035 --> 19:14.335
Now the most...

19:14.872 --> 19:19.376
the most ancient, completed manuscripts by Virgilio.

19:19.596 --> 19:24.301
This is the Virgilio Colbert Field by 493, 493.

19:24.321 --> 19:39.394
It is the most ancient, complete in the world.

19:39.474 --> 19:44.659
It is a notebook.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.744
I don't know what you're saying.

19:48.824 --> 19:50.227
This is lime.

19:51.028 --> 19:56.498
But it is... Okay, it's 11.

19:56.518 --> 20:02.108
Install your card.

20:05.767 --> 20:19.986
This is the terra cotta floor.

20:21.007 --> 20:32.162
Beautiful.

20:32.412 --> 20:36.646
Do you see how many people came here?

20:37.007 --> 20:37.689
When?

20:38.131 --> 20:44.110
In the opening period of the 5th, 600...

20:45.288 --> 20:56.599
It was like a little, little, little, little academy.

20:56.619 --> 21:12.375
Because we were in Spanish clips, we were used by the humanity, like Poliziano and Pico della Miranda, but...

21:12.862 --> 21:15.988
before the opening of the lab and to collect in.

21:16.709 --> 21:27.208
Yes, many manuscripts.

21:27.357 --> 21:37.008
When Poliziano was there, were discovered in the house of these humanists.

21:37.569 --> 21:54.428
Poliziano studied them and made his notes of the manuscripts.

21:54.897 --> 22:03.945
It's the oldest codex now that the library is always needed.

22:04.726 --> 22:06.667
It's virtual?

22:07.128 --> 22:16.956
Well, it's as well as Assyrian, the Gospel, on page 13 of the book.

22:17.096 --> 22:24.803
And then you have the same mask in the New Sacrifice by Michelangelo, but for Michelangelo it's the idea

22:25.087 --> 22:27.952
of the test.

22:27.972 --> 22:34.803
This is the name, this is bucranio.

22:34.943 --> 22:40.532
And what is that?

22:40.612 --> 22:50.588
This is the head of the sacrified animals because in the imperial Roman

22:50.770 --> 22:58.879
You have the coins, the corner of the tables in the temple, you have the head of these animals.

22:59.019 --> 23:02.683
And the name in Mr. Vars is Bukranio.

23:03.244 --> 23:03.984
Bukranio?

23:04.305 --> 23:05.406
The scone.

23:05.886 --> 23:10.391
It looks like an antelope or something?

23:10.411 --> 23:12.854
No, it's a Terracotta.

23:12.874 --> 23:17.419
E quello è tipicamente classico, come è anche la corona di alloro.

23:18.108 --> 23:23.896
It's a classic display.

23:24.297 --> 23:30.085
Like the laurel in the synagogue.

23:30.265 --> 23:36.073
The laurel is also a traditional classic.

23:36.334 --> 23:36.674
Yes.

23:36.754 --> 23:41.941
But you can say that also, not only in the Roman age, but also in the Greek.

23:41.962 --> 23:48.030
In the Greek, it's classical.

23:48.061 --> 24:09.900
What does that say that's in Greek?

24:10.741 --> 24:38.419
In 1841 the sala is opened

24:38.753 --> 24:50.766
for the Delci collection, the collection of Incunaboli, the first printed books before Gutenberg, that they make Delci and give a present to the library.

24:50.866 --> 24:54.190
That was in 18... 18?

24:55.771 --> 24:59.375
No, ma... e... e... dopo, dopo.

24:59.395 --> 25:00.176
It is after.

25:00.517 --> 25:01.418
Sì, after.

25:01.678 --> 25:07.444
Sì, ma questo non è tanto preciso.

25:12.740 --> 25:35.642
This is designed by Pasquale Porciante, an architect of the 19th century where it works in Tuscany for example in

25:35.892 --> 25:57.360
Viburna, the port of the Toscane, the neoclassical architects, the Cicternone and Cicternina, and then all of them.

25:58.336 --> 26:06.169
because in Liburn in the port of the Toshka you have like this

26:06.419 --> 26:19.821
but only the middle part of this, and it is not inside the building, but outside the building.

26:19.841 --> 26:23.887
So it mimics the port design?

26:24.027 --> 26:31.920
Poccianti was the whole system for the water in Liburno.

26:31.900 --> 26:41.978
So for the Cisternone and the Cisternino and the little

26:42.143 --> 26:51.857
building for the water and the building for the water, that is the two buildings for this water system, this town.

26:51.917 --> 26:58.145
From the hills to the hills, because the hills on the sea and then.

27:07.078 --> 27:10.783
This one,

27:11.219 --> 27:17.392
Yes, yes, yes.

27:17.673 --> 27:19.778
We have lots of books.

27:20.179 --> 27:24.568
He writes for various magazines and his own books.

27:25.330 --> 27:29.599
And I'll visit today for his research for his book on libraries.

27:29.933 --> 27:43.723
Because I don't know if there are also a CD-ROM, but it is not, I don't know.

27:44.176 --> 27:50.909
This is the first time you are in.

27:50.929 --> 27:58.003
Oh, it's beautiful.

27:58.023 --> 27:59.666
I think we're in Milano.

28:00.187 --> 28:03.414
Oh, this is L'Ambrosiano.

28:03.434 --> 28:04.256
Fantastic.

28:04.356 --> 28:05.037
Wonderful.

28:05.017 --> 28:26.974
I wish we had more time to stay.

28:26.954 --> 28:41.115
Tomorrow we leave, actually, we leave the room this afternoon to see another live day.

28:41.416 --> 28:45.502
Is that a commentary?

28:45.522 --> 28:45.662
No, no.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.685
Did you see the little character again?

28:47.705 --> 28:49.908
No.

28:49.928 --> 28:50.970
Is that here in Florence?

28:51.473 --> 28:58.806
We were talking about the nationality.

28:59.828 --> 29:02.192
What time were we leaving?

29:02.232 --> 29:09.906
I think we're leaving on the 3.30, 4 o'clock train for Rome.

29:09.926 --> 29:15.135
We will go to the rica andiana, it's very beautiful.

29:15.115 --> 29:19.699
The Ricardiana is near.

29:20.039 --> 29:22.501
It is very beautiful.

29:22.521 --> 29:24.343
It is very important to go in.

29:24.883 --> 29:26.525
It is just near.

29:27.045 --> 29:29.207
Is it open?

29:29.287 --> 29:33.070
In the afternoon.

29:33.090 --> 29:33.891
In the morning.

29:34.371 --> 29:37.114
You can go now.

29:37.154 --> 29:40.897
Now in 12 o'clock.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.558
It's closed.

29:42.678 --> 29:44.700
It's open at 12 o'clock.

29:45.001 --> 29:48.895
It's open now and... Until 12?

29:49.055 --> 29:52.648
Until 14.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.823
Okay.

29:55.223 --> 30:04.216
And the Bibliotech National, is that something to go see?

30:04.456 --> 30:08.923
In the afternoon.

30:08.943 --> 30:18.957
But for the hand dance of the library, the discipline of the library is more beautiful the Ricardiana than the National.

30:18.937 --> 30:26.619
Yes, but after we can see the name and also where it is.

30:26.819 --> 30:28.284
We don't know what.

30:28.344 --> 30:31.613
And it's closed.

30:32.133 --> 30:35.717
No, it is open and it is just near.

30:35.998 --> 30:37.880
It's near.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.963
Very good, we will go.

30:40.103 --> 30:43.367
It is in the Medici Riccardi Palace.

30:43.467 --> 30:52.798
Riccardiana, because this was the library of the Riccardi family.

30:52.838 --> 30:57.163
Riccardi, they must have been a very noble family.

30:57.183 --> 31:00.908
Before the Medici, before the Medici.

31:01.968 --> 31:17.585
Because the medicine is the person, the hand, and the most important person of the family in the 15th century has built on this company in Australia.

31:17.605 --> 31:25.714
There was a medicine that was repellent in that life in the 1230s, and they had a great experience for them.

31:25.880 --> 31:26.861
L'ha visto lei?

31:27.222 --> 31:27.382
No.

31:27.642 --> 31:36.574
Eh sì, infatti io mi sono pensata, ma ormai questa famiglia, mercanti, mercanti, ma erano politici, perché se... Dal 1800 allora eh.

31:36.594 --> 31:37.455
Eh, nel 1800.

31:37.475 --> 31:42.381
E di solito che si dice, che cos'è la vecchia, dopo l'esilio, nel 1450.

31:42.401 --> 31:50.031
Perché anche se, poi aveva le sue belle palle, ecco, quindi anche se era un ramo, comunque era loro.

31:50.602 --> 32:09.690
Look.

32:09.670 --> 32:14.180
The director and David had suggested another library that's very close.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.302
They're going to write down the name.

32:15.322 --> 32:16.485
They say it's old.

32:16.505 --> 32:17.727
It predates this.

32:17.767 --> 32:18.489
It predates this.

32:18.629 --> 32:22.618
This is near in the Madison Riccardi Palace.

32:22.638 --> 32:23.780
This is the library.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.063
The name is Riccardiana.

32:25.448 --> 32:40.067
And the madam has said that it is most beautiful to go in the Ricardiana, to the history of the library in Florence, then in Nazionale.

32:40.188 --> 32:45.294
If you want, madam, to call the director of Ricardiana.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.217
That would be wonderful.

32:47.257 --> 32:51.102
Grazie, grazie.

32:51.655 --> 33:12.944
This is an exhibition for reconstructing the history of a library, the cathedral library.

33:12.964 --> 33:20.835
Another library for you.

33:22.267 --> 33:37.744
A library that had to be a public library in Florence, a library of the Catalina.

33:37.724 --> 33:47.177
It was mainly in 1441, 1445, the idea, the project for this library.

33:47.377 --> 33:53.225
Is it considered an ecclesiastical library?

33:53.545 --> 33:56.509
It's a good question.

33:56.489 --> 34:18.278
She had a collection of books for the liturgical mass and prayers, and also a collection of cultural books, historian books in Latin and poetical books.

34:18.298 --> 34:21.001
And what was her name?

34:21.121 --> 34:22.463
It was a woman?

34:22.966 --> 34:34.063
the name of the library of Santa Maria del Fiore.

34:34.203 --> 34:45.700
And now this exhibition has collected all manuscripts of

34:45.916 --> 34:51.742
Where is the storage area down below?

34:52.103 --> 34:55.506
The storage area for the manuscripts.

34:56.107 --> 35:02.273
Where do you store the manuscripts?

35:02.694 --> 35:03.114
Who?

35:03.134 --> 35:03.294
No.

35:03.314 --> 35:12.464
Where do you store and keep the manuscripts?

35:12.504 --> 35:14.286
The new library is downstairs.

35:14.924 --> 35:19.912
You have the manuscripts that were stored here.

35:20.172 --> 35:22.375
For security system.

35:22.396 --> 35:30.248
And from 1907 to 1907, the manuscripts were engineered.

35:30.268 --> 35:31.429
Until 1907.

35:31.850 --> 35:34.735
As recently as 1907 they were here.

35:34.755 --> 35:40.864
And the Sala Delci to 1968 was the studying room.

35:41.452 --> 35:45.737
After also the study room has made it in downstairs here.

35:45.757 --> 35:48.099
So the study room was here until 1968?

35:48.420 --> 35:50.882
Yes, but in Saladel.

35:51.683 --> 35:52.745
I see.

35:52.805 --> 36:05.839
And this room is constructed for a collection, a collection of manuscripts, who came here at the end of 19th century, and now it is the exhibition part of the library.

36:07.405 --> 36:21.645
Yes, it is by Florentine fabric, made in the middle of the 16th century, but not this disease by Goblin.

36:21.725 --> 36:29.295
Disease of 1661, the Goblin is founded in Paris.

36:29.950 --> 36:32.678
Allora, here it is.

36:32.698 --> 36:34.984
This is a biblioteca.

36:35.024 --> 36:41.462
This is the biblioteca di Santa Maria del Fiore.

36:42.117 --> 37:02.573
They were the consul.

37:02.553 --> 37:19.385
of the Arte della Rana, the society for the wool, the arms of the society for the wool products.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.992
But they were also humanists.

37:23.680 --> 37:31.840
The name is Abianchi Girari.

37:31.980 --> 37:40.761
Bianchi is white and Girari is thorn.

37:40.994 --> 37:45.285
Yes, I understand.

37:45.405 --> 37:56.033
That's the other library you were talking about.

37:56.013 --> 38:24.248
This is a manuscript of two hundred centuries with the letters by sample

38:25.223 --> 38:38.375
It's very interesting because you have the text, and the commentary, and the notes.

38:38.996 --> 38:40.417
The Hams.

38:40.557 --> 38:53.830
It is the Hams of the Inghyrami Cardinal who had many, many manuscripts

38:53.978 --> 39:00.065
very expensive, very rare.

39:00.205 --> 39:16.822
He was an archbishop and like the other archbishops, he had a library like all cultural men.

39:17.904 --> 39:23.850
The name is?

39:24.252 --> 39:26.697
Cardinale, Gimignano, Indiano.

39:26.717 --> 39:27.438
Cardinale.

39:27.458 --> 39:27.979
Cardinale.

39:27.999 --> 39:28.180
I see.

39:28.200 --> 39:28.520
Cardinale.

39:28.681 --> 39:29.202
I see.

39:29.602 --> 39:30.043
Cardinale.

39:30.203 --> 39:30.404
I see.

39:30.424 --> 39:30.684
Cardinale.

39:30.704 --> 39:30.825
I see.

39:30.845 --> 39:31.165
Cardinale.

39:31.185 --> 39:31.306
I see.

39:31.386 --> 39:31.827
Cardinale.

39:31.847 --> 39:31.967
I see.

39:32.007 --> 39:32.488
Cardinale.

39:33.109 --> 39:33.229
I see.

39:33.249 --> 39:33.450
Cardinale.

39:33.470 --> 39:33.610
I see.

39:33.630 --> 39:33.830
Cardinale.

39:33.851 --> 39:33.971
I see.

39:33.991 --> 39:34.191
Cardinale.

39:34.211 --> 39:34.351
I see.

39:34.372 --> 39:34.652
Cardinale.

39:34.672 --> 39:34.973
I see.

39:34.993 --> 39:35.414
Cardinale.

39:35.654 --> 39:35.854
I see.

39:35.874 --> 39:36.195
Cardinale.

39:36.436 --> 39:36.616
I see.

39:36.636 --> 39:36.876
Cardinale.

39:36.896 --> 39:37.057
I see.

39:37.077 --> 39:37.277
Cardinale.

39:37.297 --> 39:37.417
I see.

39:37.518 --> 39:37.738
Cardinale.

39:37.904 --> 39:50.468
and he has given the present of his manuscript in his testament to the cathedral's library.

39:50.829 --> 39:54.255
Okay, he willed it in his pen.

39:58.143 --> 39:58.724
Yes.

39:58.924 --> 40:00.267
Okay.

40:00.247 --> 40:20.229
This is the arms of Casini Cardinals, who came to Siena, then came to Florence and left his manuscript to the cathedral library.

40:20.289 --> 40:30.220
This is from the Becchi family family, another cardinal.

40:30.571 --> 40:32.994
And here, this is the Cotto Farm of the Becchi Semile, he left the manuscript to the Laurenz, to the Bibbia Session.

40:33.014 --> 40:33.575
That's the note of the poem.

40:33.595 --> 40:34.235
That's the beautiful poem poem.

40:34.256 --> 40:51.837
That's the poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem

40:52.188 --> 41:12.103
Madame has said that these books were located by Pilates, Petrarch,

41:12.539 --> 41:14.241
These are the books that they notice?

41:14.261 --> 41:27.039
Yes, because a specialized search on the dark has said that it's perhaps the hand of the dark.

41:27.160 --> 41:36.673
It is amazing how they endure the clouds.

41:37.092 --> 41:46.832
What about these dates?

41:47.133 --> 42:08.702
It is very important to know in this period

42:09.020 --> 42:18.213
the laws, the civil laws, but also the laws in the church, the church laws.

42:19.415 --> 42:35.398
You have the index of this, yeah.

42:35.767 --> 42:41.813
Graziano was an Agostinian monk.

42:41.913 --> 42:55.626
Was this building part of the building that Michelangelo was there?

42:56.887 --> 42:58.048
No, no, no.

42:58.188 --> 43:01.892
It's at the end of 19th century.

43:03.779 --> 43:30.900
What is the name of this article you speak?

43:33.226 --> 43:39.412
Well, we can buy it the same place.

43:40.513 --> 43:47.440
I'd like to add light about it.

43:47.520 --> 43:52.565
It's in the forest.

43:52.685 --> 44:00.212
And there's the lamb again for the...

44:00.749 --> 44:07.637
The shape of the art of the lana.

44:07.657 --> 44:10.079
The shape of the art of the lana.

44:10.159 --> 44:13.083
Look at the wool arts.

44:13.583 --> 44:20.691
The wool arts.

44:22.813 --> 44:25.997
The gold.

44:26.315 --> 44:33.448
It's true that this is the Opera of the Duomo.

44:33.889 --> 44:40.020
Opera of the Duomo, Cathedral of Science.

44:40.501 --> 44:46.011
This is made in the collaboration of the Opera.

44:45.991 --> 44:55.283
It's beautiful, and he's got the same name.

44:55.303 --> 45:02.673
And what did that incorporate?

45:02.753 --> 45:07.459
Was it things made of wool fabrics?

45:07.439 --> 45:25.428
the fabric, the producer of war, and the power for the economic power of New York, and then, what's that?

45:25.468 --> 45:30.696
The lana, that's not bad, started in 1996.

45:31.300 --> 45:59.991
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

46:00.207 --> 46:11.186
When you say wool arts, could that also be translated as textiles?

46:11.647 --> 46:17.037
No, no, no, it's different.

46:17.117 --> 46:22.266
No, no, no, no.

46:22.246 --> 46:46.127
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:46.107 --> 46:56.472
and for working in Florence, the Middle Ages,

46:56.637 --> 47:24.501
For all workers it is necessary to have a heart.

47:24.481 --> 47:38.021
Yes, it was very important in Firenze, because in that time, the Stoffe of Firenze went to Europe.

47:38.202 --> 47:44.591
The Wall of Florence in that age came in all of Europe.

47:44.631 --> 47:50.961
These books celebrate these arts or explain these arts.

47:51.481 --> 48:09.456
This is not direct celebration of this art, but if you put the hands of the land, it is a sort of auto-celebration.

48:09.571 --> 48:30.381
But when the cathedral is constructed, the new cathedral, the gothic cathedral,

48:30.361 --> 48:36.451
L'arte della lana aiutò economicamente.

48:36.551 --> 48:41.740
Many, a lot of money for the construction.

48:44.083 --> 48:48.150
It's like an interesting lesson.

48:49.008 --> 48:50.612
I understand.

48:50.653 --> 48:52.778
The wool heart?

48:52.899 --> 49:04.350
For the wool heart it is a big honor to pay for the construction of the cathedral.

49:04.330 --> 49:15.304
the chips of the art of the lana, of the whole lana, who were humanists and historians.

49:16.265 --> 49:25.997
It is not only the merchants on the fire and stuff.

49:26.258 --> 49:33.527
And in fact, you say to the chapter of the lather,

49:33.507 --> 49:34.828
I'm afraid I'm alone.

49:36.055 --> 49:43.126
The Charter of the Library.

49:43.266 --> 49:49.155
And there's the Lamb again.

49:49.435 --> 50:04.257
Writed by Giannozzo Maletti, who was consul of Woolhart, but also humanist.

50:04.422 --> 50:10.751
Marzupini was a historian.

50:10.872 --> 50:24.912
It was a cultural connection, a civil connection.

50:27.155 --> 50:32.944
Where the...

50:33.430 --> 50:57.160
It is important the religious motive for the construction of the catheter, but it is most important to be a man of this corporation, of the wall of the house.

50:57.275 --> 51:08.132
But important is it is not only a merchant but also a humanist, historic culture.

51:08.432 --> 51:16.805
Because the religious motive is very important but it is a thing of every man, individual things.

51:16.906 --> 51:21.072
And the cattedrale reassume also the city.

51:21.288 --> 51:22.910
And the cathedral represents town.

51:22.930 --> 51:33.583
The cathedral represented the whole town, the whole city of Florence.

51:33.603 --> 51:36.346
This is the original charter of this library.

51:36.646 --> 51:38.608
No, no, of this library.

51:38.628 --> 51:42.713
Do you want to translate that?

51:42.733 --> 51:43.014
Okay.

51:43.074 --> 51:48.340
But they have in the catalog the whole book that's exposed in the catalog.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.923
I'm going to get the catalog.

51:51.747 --> 51:58.518
How long is the exhibition now?

51:58.658 --> 52:01.502
It is very interesting.

52:02.444 --> 52:15.865
The library of Santa Maria del Fiore is as far as that in the 17th century.

52:16.233 --> 52:31.014
and many ghosts are distracted by the fire and others where they don't make it life.

52:31.034 --> 52:34.619
But you were able to save a few fragments from them.

52:35.621 --> 52:41.048
This is before the restoration.

52:41.068 --> 52:43.231
That's a terrific restoration.

52:43.752 --> 52:45.835
It is important to make an idea

52:46.102 --> 52:55.652
for the restoration of the manuscript, what is the importance of the certificate.

52:55.712 --> 53:10.328
He has restorated it here, because it is the Edili collection, because when, in the 18th century, the collection of the Capitanes came here, he has named it Edili, the Edili collection.

53:10.368 --> 53:15.433
The Edili was in the Roman age, the consul for the construction, and then the name

53:15.869 --> 53:30.251
who was also named for the opera, the operari, operari workers of the cathedra, it is a name, classical name, important name.

53:30.271 --> 53:31.232
Edificare.

53:31.252 --> 53:32.154
Edificare, yes.

53:32.194 --> 53:35.098
The consul, the magistrati.

53:35.259 --> 53:39.144
Romani, delle Romani Magistrature, erano edili.

53:39.164 --> 53:40.847
Edili, yes.

53:41.333 --> 54:02.498
And do you always have an exhibition in here?

54:03.153 --> 54:09.281
We have had the most important exhibition of the Father of the Father.

54:09.461 --> 54:10.462
One every year.

54:10.622 --> 54:21.716
One or two, I mean.

54:21.877 --> 54:26.082
Are these, these are all from the collections here?

54:26.943 --> 54:30.848
Yes, but

54:31.300 --> 54:44.668
All books were in the cathedral.

54:44.868 --> 54:50.520
But not all now are in the laurentziana library.

54:51.181 --> 55:05.492
For example, I have some of the corals are in the laurentziana but other are in the opera del Duomo near the green tree.

55:06.282 --> 55:28.206
Because there were 23 chorals in the Opera del Duomo near the cathedral but in 1966 the Arno has distracted the river.

55:28.727 --> 55:32.391
But we have only three now.

55:32.607 --> 55:35.995
These box originally were out in the English of the CNES.

55:36.015 --> 55:36.957
Ah, no, no, no.

55:36.977 --> 55:41.587
Dove è stato stato originariamente.

55:41.607 --> 55:46.277
No, ma ha chiesto dove erano... Questi si trovavano nella sala dove siamo passati, ma gli ho detto di no.

55:46.438 --> 55:47.179
No, no, no.

55:47.199 --> 55:47.580
Questi no.

55:47.701 --> 55:49.705
Nella sala solo i plutei.

55:49.685 --> 55:59.861
Only the name is Pluto, like you have to see the laboratory, one of these with the iron chain.

56:00.062 --> 56:08.976
The name of this collection is Pluto because Pluto is the name of the desk for the original system of conservating the books.

56:09.074 --> 56:11.037
Not only for reading the book.

56:11.057 --> 56:13.420
Pluto is the name of the new desk?

56:13.440 --> 56:14.101
No, the desk.

56:14.121 --> 56:15.543
The desk.

56:15.564 --> 56:16.705
No, the desk.

56:16.725 --> 56:17.226
The desk.

56:17.466 --> 56:20.391
And now the collection is Pluto.

56:20.971 --> 56:23.355
The collection, for example, when... Yes, Pluto.

56:23.836 --> 56:28.082
Is that a Greek or a Latin word?

56:28.142 --> 56:32.769
And it means... And it's called the collection.

56:32.809 --> 56:35.032
Those are the collections.

56:35.052 --> 56:36.514
Is that in the catalog?

56:36.614 --> 56:37.716
Oh, good.

56:37.736 --> 56:38.457
Extra, very good.

56:38.791 --> 56:45.944
Oh, it's also page 11 and the kettlebell.

56:46.004 --> 56:48.429
That's a great thing for you.

56:48.549 --> 56:49.691
Yes.

56:49.751 --> 56:53.438
This is wonderful.

56:53.458 --> 56:55.522
This is very good.

56:55.662 --> 57:01.272
Did you see this DNA in the coffee of DNA?

57:01.538 --> 57:02.601
Excuse me?

57:02.621 --> 57:09.138
This is a coffee of DNAde with the two types of DNAde.

57:09.158 --> 57:11.464
Oh my goodness, beautiful.

57:12.220 --> 57:14.664
to type of stuff for the native.

57:14.684 --> 57:17.910
At least tapestry is always here, or has it just been in the Methodist exhibition?

57:17.930 --> 57:18.010
Yes.

57:18.030 --> 57:19.733
All right, so there is this, but it is not for the native.

57:19.753 --> 57:20.253
But I will tell you.

57:20.273 --> 57:22.237
Many of these manuscripts are still here, or has it just been in the Methodist exhibition?

57:22.257 --> 57:22.337
Yes.

57:22.357 --> 57:23.759
All right, so there is this, but it is not for the native.

57:24.260 --> 57:24.721
But I will tell you.

57:24.741 --> 57:25.622
Many of these manuscripts are still here.

57:25.642 --> 57:34.397
All right, so this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

57:35.187 --> 57:51.467
This is the family of Vespucci.

57:54.651 --> 58:01.780
The discoverer of the man whose name is America.

58:01.800 --> 58:02.121
Vespucci?

58:02.321 --> 58:03.102
Vespucci.

58:03.082 --> 58:11.230
He had many manuscripts printed and manuscript.

58:11.991 --> 58:24.583
This is designed by Giorgio Antonio Vespucci.

58:24.684 --> 58:32.211
This is a little corvary for the honing

58:32.647 --> 58:38.213
who make the honey, the name is in English, the little insects who make... The bee, the honeybee.

58:38.233 --> 58:39.554
Oh, a baby.

58:40.195 --> 58:43.599
Oh, because the name, they speak, right?

58:43.639 --> 58:46.522
That's right, they speak, the honeybee, yes.

58:46.702 --> 58:50.967
He said the honeybee is on his coat of arms, that's what the name means.

58:51.547 --> 58:53.269
Oh, they are, okay.

58:53.329 --> 58:57.574
They're not saying that I can thank you, no one of these.

58:57.959 --> 59:00.862
And what is the bee?

59:01.283 --> 59:02.344
The bee, honey bee.

59:02.364 --> 59:03.866
This is honey bee.

59:03.886 --> 59:05.828
I see, I see.

59:06.349 --> 59:15.319
Also the bee have three, for the bird, bee called bee.

59:15.439 --> 59:19.984
And bee is many bee.

59:20.082 --> 59:24.629
Bigs and then you have in the ham street bigs.

59:25.050 --> 59:29.116
That's what I'm talking about.

59:29.296 --> 59:32.982
This is by Vespucci.

59:33.523 --> 59:36.828
No, this is by Vespucci.

59:36.848 --> 59:39.272
Vespucci.

59:39.910 --> 59:46.424
Liber Donatus, Giorgio Antonio Vespucci.

59:46.745 --> 59:53.820
This is the four lines you have been in Giorgio Antonio Vespucci.

59:54.241 --> 59:55.483
This is fine.

59:57.507 --> 01:00:00.113
No, it's not that one.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:15.942
Vespucci always wrote on his books and also in Latin.

01:00:16.175 --> 01:00:23.161
to the start of the books, an invocazione for a lecture.

01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:28.385
Is this a miracle of his book?

01:00:28.445 --> 01:00:34.010
No, no, this is family.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:39.394
It is the son of his brother.

01:00:40.796 --> 01:00:46.080
This is the words to the start of the books.

01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:49.033
I don't say in Italian, I say in Bocat.
