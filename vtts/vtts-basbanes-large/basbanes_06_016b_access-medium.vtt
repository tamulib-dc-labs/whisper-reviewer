I have $250,000 in stock.

22:07.761 --> 22:08.141
$400,000.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.063
I have $400,000 for the war.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.827
$500,000.

22:11.847 --> 22:12.028
$500,000.

22:12.048 --> 22:13.129
$500,000.

22:13.149 --> 22:13.330
$600,000.

22:13.350 --> 22:13.530
$600,000.

22:13.510 --> 22:16.095
Seven hundred, six.

22:16.676 --> 22:20.263
Eight hundred, six.

22:20.283 --> 22:21.345
Nine hundred, nine fifty.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.070
One million, one fifty.

22:24.090 --> 22:24.892
One million, one fifty.

22:25.954 --> 22:27.276
One million, two, six.

22:28.399 --> 22:31.705
One million, three, six.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.308
One million, four, six.

22:34.317 --> 22:37.902
$1,450,000 in the second room.

22:37.922 --> 22:41.266
I have $1,450,000 in the second room.

22:41.286 --> 22:44.150
I have $1,450,000 in the second room.

22:44.170 --> 22:46.513
I have $1,450,000 in the second room.

22:46.973 --> 22:57.166

22:57.186 --> 22:57.927
I have $1,450,000 in the second room.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.329
Thank you all, everybody.

22:59.613 --> 23:04.260
I think he said number 50, though.

23:05.302 --> 23:06.604
I think he said number 50.

23:06.624 --> 23:07.285
So what the number 50 is?

23:07.305 --> 23:10.470
Someone in the room, in the middle of the room.

23:10.491 --> 23:10.591
Yeah.

23:13.115 --> 23:18.563
I'm going to ask a guy with a red, white, blue shirt on.

23:18.584 --> 23:21.428
Can you see Bison already?

23:21.689 --> 23:24.553
It's pretty chaotic.

23:24.573 --> 23:25.114
How's that?

23:25.567 --> 23:52.603
This is the gentleman.

23:53.191 --> 24:19.011
Excuse me, Mr. Newman.

24:19.031 --> 24:19.452
Can I take your hand?

24:19.887 --> 24:22.231
How are you?

24:22.411 --> 24:22.852
Thank you.

24:23.353 --> 24:23.894
How are you doing?

24:23.914 --> 24:24.014
Hi.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.457
Mr. Newham, my name is Nick Bazbaines.

24:25.517 --> 24:26.759
I'm a writer from Massachusetts.

24:26.859 --> 24:31.387
I'm doing a book for Landon House on book collecting dealers, major collections.

24:31.487 --> 24:35.414
And I wonder if you could give me a time if I'd get in touch with you, sir.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.436
Oh, really?

24:36.516 --> 24:37.498
Well done.

24:37.638 --> 24:38.820
I want to talk to you.

24:38.860 --> 24:39.962
You know what, just a second?

24:39.982 --> 24:40.984
Sure.

24:41.420 --> 24:50.622
I'm going to talk to this gentleman at some point for my study.

24:50.642 --> 24:53.689
I know Mr. Larry.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.172
I'm just going to get his card.

24:55.192 --> 24:55.814
I'll be in touch with you, sir.

24:55.834 --> 24:55.934
Yeah.

24:55.954 --> 24:56.295
It's a nice card.

24:56.315 --> 24:56.796
Thank you, sir.

24:58.497 --> 25:05.800
Mr. Kirshenbaum.

25:05.820 --> 25:06.683
You were successful.

25:06.903 --> 25:09.913
I noticed you got the next to last one.

25:09.933 --> 25:10.675
I got two left.

25:10.876 --> 25:11.578
Did you?

25:12.098 --> 25:38.832
which which ones in particular was it for sentimental reasons no i bought the uh stolen collection you did and is this for stock or is it for a client how do you feel how do you feel now you put half of this collection together how do you feel sometimes i fall through the floor when i see the prices you know what i sold them now some of these things that you brought today are these things that you originally

25:38.812 --> 25:57.563
remember that i bought the standing papers i sold them for four thousand dollars it was a great sale huh sure i'll be in touch with you i'm going to give you a call

25:57.543 --> 26:21.272
Mr. Chairman, is this something you bought for stock or is this for yourself?

26:21.252 --> 26:23.375
His name is not to be revealed.

26:23.415 --> 26:28.482
If I give you a call, could you talk to me a little bit about your work?

26:28.622 --> 26:30.144
Oh, sure.

26:30.325 --> 26:32.247
I'll be back in Chicago probably Friday.

26:32.267 --> 26:34.971
And I really need a Chicago presence in my book.

26:35.172 --> 26:37.214
I'm doing both coats, sit in between.

26:37.294 --> 26:38.516
I'm going to Texas in two weeks.

26:38.576 --> 26:39.798
I've been to Philly.

26:39.918 --> 26:42.181
I've been doing a lot of stuff in Boston and down here.

26:42.201 --> 26:46.768
So I understand that when it comes to patriotic items, you're the top guy.

26:46.788 --> 26:47.349
Is that correct?

26:47.389 --> 26:48.390
Well, we're one of the top guys.

26:48.370 --> 26:52.556
So this is for a collector, a private collection, or an institutional collection.

26:52.576 --> 26:55.339
At some point, will this person want to disclose who he is?

26:55.359 --> 26:55.559
Sure.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.782
Could I call you at some point?

26:57.802 --> 26:59.324
Would you tell me after he discloses it?

26:59.344 --> 27:00.486
Because I'm in Massachusetts.

27:00.506 --> 27:01.067
Good, thanks.

27:05.112 --> 27:11.921
George Washington's journey of the Missouri.

27:12.061 --> 27:14.444
Item number, I don't even know.

27:14.464 --> 27:16.046
For stock or for client?

27:16.407 --> 27:16.487
Yes.

27:17.075 --> 27:18.217
Great.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.363
I mean, it's fabulous.

27:21.383 --> 27:23.748
I don't know what happened.

27:23.768 --> 27:28.817
For the sake of my tape, don't say who you are again right now.

27:28.837 --> 27:29.799
It's David Block.

27:29.859 --> 27:30.019
Okay.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.524
It's going to be awfully hard to correlate my tapes.

27:32.865 --> 27:34.287
No, we talked outside.

27:34.307 --> 27:34.688
We did.

27:34.708 --> 27:35.530
Yeah, no, I didn't.

27:35.610 --> 27:36.191
I have your card.

27:36.311 --> 27:39.437
I just want to listen to the tape.

27:40.497 --> 27:43.101
What do you think about the declaration?

27:43.121 --> 27:45.545
Well, I don't want to say.

27:45.646 --> 27:50.574
I mean, I was told by somebody who thinks they know it's $25.44.

27:50.594 --> 27:50.994
$25.46.

27:51.095 --> 27:53.118
That's a mess.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.981
Good for you.

27:55.542 --> 28:00.811
I mean, I'll probably price the book.

28:00.911 --> 28:05.078
I'll probably price the book at what it's worth, which is probably $35,000.

28:05.098 --> 28:05.779
Great.

28:07.058 --> 28:08.681
H-I-M-E.

28:09.562 --> 28:10.824
H-I-M-E.

28:10.844 --> 28:11.565
And where is your shop?

28:12.166 --> 28:13.749
In Idlewild, California.

28:13.869 --> 28:14.811
I see.

28:14.831 --> 28:15.652
I'd introduce myself.

28:15.712 --> 28:16.554
I'm Nick Bazbaines.

28:16.574 --> 28:17.415
I'm from Massachusetts.

28:17.455 --> 28:18.577
I'm writing a book.

28:18.737 --> 28:21.722
It's on a contract to Random House about grateful collectors.

28:21.802 --> 28:24.006
It's not how to collect.

28:24.086 --> 28:25.027
I'll tell you what.

28:25.128 --> 28:25.628
Is it going?

28:25.889 --> 28:26.530
It's going.

28:26.550 --> 28:26.670
Okay.

28:26.937 --> 28:52.472

28:53.914 --> 28:58.961
I'm going to send you a package of things that will give you some idea of what I'm doing, articles I've done.

28:59.001 --> 29:00.604
You have a pretty good sale.

29:00.624 --> 29:01.966
I watched it.

29:04.069 --> 29:11.520
It was the world record for a single American literary autograph letter, 120,000.

29:11.580 --> 29:16.286
No American literary, maybe a group of letters, just to Hawthorne's wife.

29:16.607 --> 29:19.431
And Hawthorne was the stagnatee of Moby Dick.

29:20.813 --> 29:21.514
Yeah.

29:21.916 --> 29:30.930
Franklin was for mine.

29:31.990 --> 29:53.312
California collector or?

29:53.332 --> 29:54.053
Well, I mean, I'd rather not say it.

29:54.073 --> 29:55.274
If you needed to know, I'd tell you what you needed to know.

29:55.294 --> 29:55.855
Just that it wasn't working.

29:55.875 --> 29:56.295
No, it was bird line.

29:56.315 --> 29:58.477
I think we're going off to meet his faces in this game, and I've never heard of Keller's that kind of thing.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.078
Well, he had a... He had a...

29:59.058 --> 30:02.663
I hardly ever do autographs.

30:03.464 --> 30:06.107
I mean, I bought a few autographs.

30:07.008 --> 30:10.052
She hardly ever does books.

30:10.453 --> 30:16.280
I really don't know anything without a letter and a picture.

30:16.300 --> 30:20.686
Lady, what did you say the record, the record for a printed American book?

30:20.766 --> 30:21.187
Was that right?

30:21.207 --> 30:21.888
One million.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.590
Three was the federal.

30:23.890 --> 30:24.431
It was the federal.

30:24.451 --> 30:26.754
You have to add one point.

30:26.774 --> 30:26.854
Wow.

30:26.834 --> 30:27.695
143.

30:27.856 --> 30:29.959
Jim Cummins dropped out of that at about 700.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.622
He was standing in the back.

30:31.642 --> 30:32.343
He went to the back.

30:32.423 --> 30:33.845
I don't see him here.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.850
I got an eye on him.

30:36.870 --> 30:39.554
He dropped out at 700,000.

30:39.575 --> 30:40.496
So I was watching him.

30:40.516 --> 30:42.379
I have my eye on him.

30:43.692 --> 30:50.380
I'm talking here to K-A-L-L.

30:50.400 --> 30:54.826
I'm wondering what you're interested in, but I can tell you a little about us.

30:54.926 --> 31:04.618
We deal mostly in manuscripts and documents, American historical stuff primarily.

31:04.638 --> 31:12.147
And the two best things that we've gotten so far are the 13th Amendment signed by Emerson and the Emancipation Proclamation.

31:12.127 --> 31:14.530
Nothing like that.

31:14.970 --> 31:20.016
We took them over to Gettysburg College last year to exhibit it during a Lincoln Fellowship meeting.

31:22.059 --> 31:25.663
We'd like to do more of that.

31:25.683 --> 31:32.271
Were you buying today for clients or for stock?

31:32.291 --> 31:33.392
Primarily for clients.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.742
That's my day job.

31:35.842 --> 31:41.187
I mean, this is, I'm going to look at her, who would you tell her?

31:41.207 --> 31:42.308
Primarily for clients.

31:42.328 --> 31:46.352
The Federalist was a bit for clients.

31:46.412 --> 31:56.702
We were hoping to be able to exhibit that worldwide, first in the United States and then overseas.

31:56.722 --> 32:02.367
Draw some attention to early political movement and

32:04.034 --> 32:05.856
getting a competition set up.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.080
Do you know who you watched that to?

32:09.140 --> 32:11.143
That was to a telephone.

32:11.163 --> 32:11.363
Right.

32:11.383 --> 32:11.684
I have no idea.

32:11.704 --> 32:14.647
Did you have some idea what a competition was on that, I wonder?

32:15.268 --> 32:18.753
I knew who I thought would be bidding.

32:19.754 --> 32:26.262
It turns out that I was right on the Declaration of Independence and perhaps not right on this.

32:27.355 --> 32:28.277
I have an idea.

32:28.558 --> 32:36.355
Jim Covington said it was about 700.

32:36.395 --> 32:36.656
Yeah.

32:37.237 --> 32:41.386
I thought he was going to go far.

32:41.406 --> 32:41.988
You never know.

32:42.369 --> 32:42.870
You never know.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.754
I would have liked a bit more of that.

32:44.774 --> 32:46.157
Always that funny.

32:47.437 --> 33:11.217
the producer i was telling you about i'm writing a very interesting book i'm under contract and the great collectors are going to be here i mean i really think that you should

33:11.382 --> 33:12.845
I will treat everything with confidence.

33:12.905 --> 33:13.667
Maybe we could talk.

33:13.847 --> 33:15.390
You're a great collection right now.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.051
Yeah, but you're young.

33:16.212 --> 33:18.015
I'm interested in finding some young people.

33:18.356 --> 33:20.460
I'm a writer also.

33:20.661 --> 33:21.603
Where are you from?

33:21.843 --> 33:23.005
West End City.

33:23.186 --> 33:24.328
I'm going down at...

33:25.068 --> 33:53.826
Let me make sure I know which two important

33:54.262 --> 33:55.385
What do you write?

33:55.906 --> 34:00.720
Actually, I graduated in Miami, University of Denver.

34:00.740 --> 34:02.524
So right now, I'm building for college.

34:02.545 --> 34:06.415
I'm not unpublished because I have a great, massive prediction, although I haven't intended it yet.

34:06.665 --> 34:20.109
but I'm just trying to build a decent portfolio.

34:20.670 --> 34:21.031
You live in Texas?

34:21.051 --> 34:21.211
Yes.

34:21.231 --> 34:22.233
You came up to this show?

34:22.473 --> 34:23.455
Especially for the show.

34:24.196 --> 34:24.677
And you were successful?

34:24.697 --> 34:24.777
99%.

34:24.798 --> 34:25.078
This is great.

34:25.058 --> 34:49.311
I'll give you my name once more.

34:49.763 --> 34:53.267
How about a phone number?

34:53.507 --> 34:53.728
Okay.

34:54.028 --> 34:58.333
915-683-8282.

34:58.433 --> 35:04.460
Okay, what I'll probably do is, for this, I'm... How do we... How do we spell the name?

35:04.480 --> 35:05.682
MCG, I'm sorry.

35:05.902 --> 35:06.082
MCG-UI.

35:06.162 --> 35:08.665
And... Yes, G-A-M.

35:08.685 --> 35:08.946
Okay.

35:08.966 --> 35:14.933
I'll show you some things, I think, to get out here right now.

35:14.953 --> 35:17.796
It's... John is coming through.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.862
But why borrow?

35:19.882 --> 35:21.624
I think you're right.

35:21.844 --> 35:23.466
It's really important.

35:23.486 --> 35:24.267
Childhood passion.

35:24.307 --> 35:27.490
But it likes childhood dating.

35:29.532 --> 35:31.515
Early, you know, 10, 11, 12, from then on.

35:32.275 --> 35:34.558
But then, you know, I've moved into Hemingway.

35:35.259 --> 35:39.964
There's a definite maturity in my collecting, whereas I'm sure 10, 15 years from now, I'll be with the borrow.

35:39.984 --> 35:40.805
Were you here yesterday?

35:40.965 --> 35:41.806
Yes, I was.

35:41.866 --> 35:43.648
Did you get anything yesterday?

35:43.628 --> 35:45.230
Sun also rises.

35:45.370 --> 35:51.055
I was very excited.

35:51.095 --> 35:55.079
Most of it went for very reasonable.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.262
He was a prophet.

35:58.282 --> 36:00.023
He predicted who the letter was.

36:00.043 --> 36:03.587
Every collector has been on a great field.

36:03.827 --> 36:06.610
Especially the book field.

36:06.630 --> 36:09.132
It's the one field that I have never seen people in.

36:09.152 --> 36:11.374
If I had come to this auction without

36:11.354 --> 36:18.192
And just plain alacrity, I wouldn't have purchased one book because I would not know what to expect.

36:18.543 --> 36:28.494
I thought the Gatsby did not have a first aid test check.

36:29.254 --> 36:42.188
That really wasn't a very good part.

36:42.168 --> 36:47.515
What goes on the phone between collectors is so completely different.

36:47.716 --> 36:55.106
I could amass the same collection and never come here, but some of these books do have a thing or whatever.

36:55.126 --> 36:56.147
It will surface in a reasonable amount.

36:56.207 --> 36:58.591
Did you get the heavyweight books that were inscribed to Bradley Martin?

36:58.611 --> 37:00.273
I bet those were wonderful.

37:00.293 --> 37:00.974
I didn't.

37:00.994 --> 37:03.057
I would have liked to, but those were a few.

37:03.077 --> 37:09.185
The books I bought were great enough for the sale that they were a reasonable price, and they were a key book.

37:09.285 --> 37:11.348
The Bradley Martin books, I could find them.

37:11.328 --> 37:12.409
Better associations.

37:12.449 --> 37:14.631
The only reason I was more close to the association.

37:14.671 --> 37:15.572
Which is nice.

37:15.592 --> 37:16.994
Is this your first auction?

37:17.014 --> 37:18.876
I've seen how I know I've been to two or three others.

37:18.976 --> 37:19.877
The York auction?

37:19.897 --> 37:20.497
Yes.

37:20.517 --> 37:21.318
Which year?

37:21.358 --> 37:25.402
South Lee's, Christine's, and Bernsie's.

37:25.483 --> 37:26.143
Okay.

37:26.183 --> 37:30.287
How long have you been a collector now?

37:31.268 --> 37:31.569
Five years.

37:31.769 --> 37:33.511
What's the first book you bought as a collector?

37:33.531 --> 37:38.116
First book out of Tarzan Dames, the first station at Tarzan Dames.

37:38.136 --> 37:38.676
Are you going?

37:38.996 --> 37:39.337
Yeah.

37:39.457 --> 37:40.558
I've seen anything of interest.

37:41.028 --> 37:49.765
I'm taking the train across country.

37:49.886 --> 37:55.577
I'll be out there for making the last day.

37:56.114 --> 38:04.290
I've been a journalist for 25 years, but how do you afford to do this?

38:04.831 --> 38:08.799
I've been fortunate I have a small experience.

38:08.819 --> 38:10.843
Writing is my first passion so I can pursue that.

38:11.104 --> 38:12.968
There are other options I can take.

38:12.988 --> 38:15.152
I'm very interested in film.

38:15.132 --> 38:18.357
Is your family supportive of the collection?

38:18.377 --> 38:18.858
Yes, they are.

38:18.878 --> 38:21.842
My mother collects, and so she's very supportive.

38:21.902 --> 38:23.444
She understands my train of thought.

38:23.525 --> 38:26.269
My father has never had that passion, so he doesn't quite understand.

38:26.289 --> 38:31.096
But he's supportive because most of the things I collect, he's familiar with.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.261
So it's not so off the wall that he can't respect it.

38:34.281 --> 38:34.381
Good.

38:34.401 --> 38:38.808
I'm looking for very interesting... The book I'm writing is really wonderful.

38:39.168 --> 38:41.071
That's very theoretical.

38:41.171 --> 38:42.473
We sold it to the first...

38:42.773 --> 38:59.837
as i see the auction records and i know i sat down with mark and we traced we would find a book that i was interested in and there are several books that i didn't bid on i wasn't going to but i was interested in history and

39:00.070 --> 39:05.717
The same books have been, you know, very few of them have turned out the same books have been coming up every so, every 30 years.

39:06.338 --> 39:11.665
And I'm very fortunate that if I can wait 30 years for the book and it does come up again, then I can get back.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.389
What's the focus of your collection, American literature?

39:14.509 --> 39:15.811
Modern, yeah.

39:16.151 --> 39:19.075
20th century American literature.

39:19.055 --> 39:21.802
And are you looking for inscribed things?

39:21.822 --> 39:24.649
Are you going to go into many sort of things?

39:25.351 --> 39:26.635
Manuscripts have progressed.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.021
I'd have to, right now, an example.

39:29.041 --> 39:33.773
I would venture to guess, although we'll never come up for now, at least for the next several decades.

39:34.124 --> 39:38.410
The manuscript is something like Tars and the Apes, which is where that would be completely in the field.

39:38.430 --> 39:38.930
Where is that?

39:39.371 --> 39:40.452
It's with the corporation.

39:41.514 --> 39:45.339
But that's a million dollar manuscript.

39:45.379 --> 39:45.960
Maybe more.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.161
Maybe more, exactly.

39:47.181 --> 39:50.506
I think it were broken up and sold for leaves.

39:50.586 --> 39:52.569
I would really hope that doesn't happen.

39:52.609 --> 39:57.415
One of the requests in my study is that the collector is more than just an accumulator.

39:57.395 --> 40:02.103
teaching is also responsible for the presentation.

40:02.123 --> 40:03.605
What is my passion?

40:03.625 --> 40:18.330
I don't necessarily, there's some authors where I only collect one or two titles that they've done because those are my favorite books, because I don't care for their things, but certain authors like Fitzgerald and Burroughs, although they're not in the same class, but they're contemporaries, I actually have a passion for everything I've done.

40:18.410 --> 40:20.914
How large is your collection?

40:21.796 --> 40:22.677
I've got

40:23.585 --> 40:27.851
all but one Burroughs title, and they're 16.

40:27.871 --> 40:37.144
Some of them have probably the best autographed books and the best associations and the best presentation copies.

40:37.164 --> 40:39.227
You wrote your first book when you were 18?

40:39.247 --> 40:39.688
No, when I was 16.

40:39.708 --> 40:41.590
With the intention of being a collector?

40:41.610 --> 40:52.866
You know, I had gotten into the field of Burroughs, and I knew Burroughs, and I really wanted to start collecting, and this was a book that a friend of mine had, and it was one that was pretty cheap, not cheap, but I mean,

40:53.099 --> 40:55.864
It was below market price at the time that he would sell it to me.

40:56.485 --> 41:01.674
So I worked the whole summer as a garbage man, and I purchased that for my entire summer earnings.

41:01.694 --> 41:02.455
And that was only $600.

41:02.495 --> 41:06.041
I worked 15 hour days for three months.

41:06.703 --> 41:10.349
This dealer that you were buying with today, he's from California.

41:10.369 --> 41:11.631
How did you connect with him?

41:11.611 --> 41:14.296
Just through associations with other collectors.

41:14.316 --> 41:18.122
Well, Chris Burrows is basically a California town.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.146
Well, we're sort of in Chicago.

41:20.166 --> 41:23.151
Well, ties in his Tarzan years in California.

41:23.592 --> 41:28.521
But, you know, Mark deals with several selected Burrows.

41:28.541 --> 41:31.726
So you just kind of gravitated, you connected basically.

41:31.806 --> 41:32.708
He's sort of that.

41:33.346 --> 41:36.151
I listen, and I learn, and I check, and I come back.

41:37.072 --> 41:47.549
What's interesting, you see, is you're 23, in 20 years, a young man, early 40s, and you'll have one hell of a major collection.

41:47.569 --> 41:48.851
Bradley Martin started mine.

41:48.891 --> 41:49.192
That's right.

41:49.212 --> 41:50.935
So what's the goal?

41:50.955 --> 41:52.898
I mean, what happens to your books in 50 years?

41:53.439 --> 41:54.240
Have you thought of that?

41:54.743 --> 41:58.289
Well, ideally, and tax reasons aren't a factor.

41:58.569 --> 42:03.237
I won't not donate my collection to a museum because of the tax laws currently.

42:03.778 --> 42:08.445
Do you think it will be significant enough to maintain as a collection?

42:08.926 --> 42:12.752
Well, I have two conflicting emotions on that.

42:13.205 --> 42:17.751
If once it goes to an institution, it's deadlocked into that institution, and it would never get that kind of private.

42:17.771 --> 42:19.313
You wouldn't have something like this.

42:19.334 --> 42:22.438
I find people saying both things, and I really respect that.

42:22.698 --> 42:24.441
I look at the University of Texas.

42:24.461 --> 42:25.963
They're some of the finest books.

42:26.083 --> 42:28.366
And when they list the other copies, they're in that library.

42:28.526 --> 42:29.928
They'll never see the light of day again.

42:29.988 --> 42:31.170
No one will ever see that book.

42:31.190 --> 42:32.271
What do you know about the university?

42:32.352 --> 42:33.373
I'm going down there.

42:33.353 --> 42:35.797
All my friends go there, all my friends go there.

42:35.817 --> 42:39.001
I mean, what do you know about the collecting?

42:40.043 --> 42:41.104
They don't collect.

42:41.345 --> 42:42.587
Everything's donated.

42:43.107 --> 42:44.750
They spend a lot of money.

42:44.770 --> 42:47.434
I know they do, but I mean, most collections go there.

42:47.454 --> 42:51.900
I mean, my grandfather's donated, you know, his estate, and everything's donated.

42:51.920 --> 42:55.646
But once it's there, it's gone.

42:55.746 --> 42:59.171
Whereas if I die, then my collection was turned over.

42:59.191 --> 43:00.593
It's back out in the market.

43:00.758 --> 43:03.510
And Bradley Martin, who's been immortal on it.

43:03.530 --> 43:03.590
OK.

43:03.811 --> 43:04.614
What's the motivation?

43:04.936 --> 43:06.804
Is it to hold, to have, to possess?

43:06.824 --> 43:09.013
How do you enjoy these things?

43:09.702 --> 43:33.043
Is there ever kind of a let down when you get an item?

43:33.496 --> 43:38.482
like, all right, now I've got to put it on the shelf and then just forget about it and then go on to the next one?

43:38.782 --> 43:40.705
I mean, there are a lot of collectors who've got it.

43:40.905 --> 43:42.447
Well, right now I have absolutely zero emotion.

43:42.547 --> 43:45.070
I came out very, very well at this point.

43:45.090 --> 43:45.511
Zero emotion.

43:45.531 --> 43:47.994
Were you intent on getting the items that you got?

43:48.514 --> 43:49.556
Was price and object?

43:50.437 --> 43:52.920
Did you have drop-off points or were you going to go?

43:53.260 --> 43:54.241
Yes, I did.

43:54.281 --> 43:57.265
The things I bought, I didn't spend ridiculous prices on.

43:57.285 --> 43:58.667
I bought at fair market prices.

43:58.747 --> 44:02.271
A lot of these books, like the Gatsby, that's a $4,500 book.

44:02.605 --> 44:04.788
a first edition, which it wasn't.

44:05.609 --> 44:08.633
And that book, the book is worth $300, and that jacket's worth $100.

44:09.334 --> 44:18.286
And so, I mean, for me to go out in the marketplace and buy a first edition book and then come in these bookstores for a later printing dust jacket and then pair them together, that's not a $45 book.

44:18.426 --> 44:20.689
So that was, I didn't think very intelligent.

44:20.709 --> 44:22.632
But I did not pay any ridiculous prices.

44:22.652 --> 44:25.516
I bought within way below most of my bids.

44:25.576 --> 44:26.717
So in a sense, I came out.

44:26.737 --> 44:29.441
So you came here knowing how much you were prepared to spend?

44:29.501 --> 44:30.522
I had to the pen.

44:30.823 --> 44:31.684
And what was that for you?

44:32.170 --> 44:33.633
I'm just going to go over it.

44:33.693 --> 44:34.475
Did you go over it?

44:34.495 --> 44:35.076
Did you go over it?

44:35.617 --> 44:36.719
I went over it.

44:36.739 --> 44:38.482
I did go over it.

44:38.843 --> 44:42.991
I had my entire list, and there were certain books that if I didn't get them... And you could apply that.

44:43.031 --> 44:43.552
Exactly.

44:44.033 --> 44:46.318
But I got everything for half of what I had.

44:46.438 --> 44:47.540
Not necessarily half.

44:47.560 --> 44:47.961
No kidding.

44:47.981 --> 44:50.346
But there were certain books, like The Sun Also Rises, I didn't feel.

44:50.386 --> 44:51.428
There were only four copies.

44:51.408 --> 44:55.714
that it turned over in the last 20 years, that that book was a book I was going to get anytime soon.

44:55.734 --> 44:59.579
If I didn't make the effort now to take that book off the market... Now, when do you get this stuff?

44:59.599 --> 45:00.681
Are you going to ship it for you?

45:00.701 --> 45:02.704
I was supposed to take it with me, but there was a complication.

45:03.225 --> 45:04.987
And how many lots did you get?

45:08.472 --> 45:10.535
Four today, four districts.

45:10.595 --> 45:11.276
I got eight lots.

45:11.296 --> 45:12.217
Good.

45:12.237 --> 45:13.018
We'll be in touch.

45:13.038 --> 45:14.000
Congratulations.

45:14.020 --> 45:17.905
Good, thanks.
