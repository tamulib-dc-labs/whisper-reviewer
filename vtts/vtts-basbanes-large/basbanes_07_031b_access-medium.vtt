00:02.647 --> 00:04.830
off to New Zealand, to Wellington.

00:04.850 --> 00:07.072
That was where he went to school to start with.

00:07.733 --> 00:12.298
Then later, he was with the University of Pennsylvania.

00:12.358 --> 00:15.002
He became a landscape architect.

00:15.022 --> 00:16.844
Austin's A-U-S-T-I-N.

00:17.124 --> 00:17.725
Yeah, Strong.

00:18.125 --> 00:18.546
Strong.

00:18.786 --> 00:27.016
And he collaborated with Lloyd on some plays.

00:27.036 --> 00:31.301
We've got one over there, the Treasure Island that they did.

00:31.321 --> 00:32.282
And he finally...

00:32.650 --> 00:38.716
wound up as the Commodore of the Fleet up in Nantucket, teaching people to sail.

00:39.177 --> 00:42.560
And it's 5 Quince Street, Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.

00:42.580 --> 00:43.321
That's right.

00:43.341 --> 00:44.061
September 7, 1944.

00:44.562 --> 00:47.305
And who was George Ulysio again?

00:47.325 --> 00:47.905
He was a collector.

00:47.925 --> 00:50.308
He was a collector and, as I say, a deadbeat.

00:51.028 --> 00:53.891
And I wonder why he so nicely gave this to Ulysio.

00:54.772 --> 00:58.976
Well, you see, Ulysio was an ardent Stephenson.

00:58.996 --> 01:02.640
He was a great enthusiast.

01:02.823 --> 01:10.995
evidently was able to convince Austin Strong that he was a devoted Stevenson.

01:11.015 --> 01:13.559
What do we suppose the idea Roman means?

01:13.819 --> 01:20.629
Well, he evidently felt he seemed to feel that he was, you see, making a struggle for liberty and so on.

01:20.649 --> 01:20.930
I see.

01:20.950 --> 01:21.370
Okay.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.031
That's to George.

01:22.051 --> 01:23.373
As I say, he got mixed up.

01:23.433 --> 01:25.036
Haddonfield is in New Jersey.

01:25.376 --> 01:25.897
Oh, I see.

01:26.839 --> 01:29.202
And Roman, you said, never paid his book debts.

01:29.654 --> 01:33.259
I mean, I don't know when Ulyssio never paid his book debts.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.082
I only met him once.

01:35.422 --> 01:40.990
He came to Dawson's one time, and he gave his address.

01:41.071 --> 01:45.838
He wanted me to send the books so that he wouldn't have to pay the sales tax, you see, somehow.

01:46.298 --> 01:53.068
And when he gave his name, I just about flipped, and I sent a note back to the office.

01:53.088 --> 01:57.214
Well, he had owed for so long that they didn't have the record anymore, and

01:57.515 --> 01:59.361
And so I had to let it go.

01:59.381 --> 02:09.834
But in the meantime, and trying to keep him diverted and keep my eye on the office, I made a mistake of $10 in his favor, of course.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.018
And I wrote to him.

02:11.285 --> 02:18.074
and worded the letter very carefully, and the implication was that I would have to pay the ten dollars, which, of course, I wouldn't.

02:18.094 --> 02:18.895
You know, he sent it.

02:19.235 --> 02:20.397
Oh, he did?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.399
I couldn't believe it.

02:23.180 --> 02:26.865
Did you tell us just once again, because I didn't have a tape recorder, how Mr. Strauss got this desk?

02:27.326 --> 02:37.579
Well, Mr. Elisio, as I say, owned people, east and west, and the minute that Austin Strong was dead,

02:38.335 --> 02:43.460
He turned this in on an unpaid book bill at Sessler's in Philadelphia.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.662
And Mr. Strauss bought it from Sessler's.

02:47.184 --> 02:48.305
The grandson of Mr. Strong?

02:48.325 --> 02:48.425
What?

02:48.445 --> 02:51.068
The grandson had turned the desk in?

02:51.128 --> 02:51.248
No.

02:51.308 --> 02:54.631
Because Strong gave it to Ulysseo, so the minute that Ulysseo was dead.

02:54.912 --> 02:59.576
No, the minute that Austin Strong was dead, Ulysseo had the desk.

02:59.596 --> 03:05.102
And the minute that the giver of the desk was dead, he felt that he could turn it in.

03:05.825 --> 03:06.646
Oh, I see.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.727
So this was not a... He didn't own it.

03:08.828 --> 03:10.269
Strong still owned it, perhaps.

03:10.469 --> 03:12.571
Well, Strong didn't own it.

03:12.591 --> 03:14.272
He had given it to Elysio.

03:14.292 --> 03:14.392
Okay.

03:14.412 --> 03:18.736
So Elysio had it, and Elysio used it in lieu of cash.

03:18.856 --> 03:19.277
I see.

03:19.317 --> 03:23.901
Oh, so he had to wait until this gentleman died to be subtle about it, in other words.

03:23.921 --> 03:25.282
Yeah, exactly.

03:25.322 --> 03:31.387
I'm sure he liked it all right, but he probably... I doubt that he cleared the bill with this.

03:32.408 --> 03:33.509
That's a great story.

03:33.569 --> 03:34.870
He owed everybody.

03:36.470 --> 03:43.638
He said he owed everybody, and how did he deal with everything?

03:43.758 --> 03:52.907
He owed dealers right and left, and once in a while he'd put upâ€”he had a very good collection, various collections.

03:54.109 --> 04:03.118
The books would come up at auction, and the dealers would just sit back and refuse to bid, you see, just let the prices be slaughtered.

04:03.301 --> 04:29.055
if you did if you'd look at some of the auctions you know you'd think that a certain author was let's say charles dickens or somebody like that you know was really going down the drain and it was just that the dealers were getting back at him they they weren't going to let him realize anything on on the books that that he probably hadn't paid for

04:30.233 --> 04:35.356
He's dead and gone now, and I don't know if he's got any relevance.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.746
I wouldn't want to be slewed.
