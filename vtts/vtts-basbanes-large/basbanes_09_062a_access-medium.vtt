WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:04.946
You know, you amazed me, Jim.

00:04.966 --> 00:08.049
We're talking about James Lee, Birth and Boston.

00:08.069 --> 00:12.313
And what's this now, the sixth, what was the show?

00:12.333 --> 00:13.394
The series.

00:13.474 --> 00:13.774
Yeah.

00:13.975 --> 00:15.897
Does it get harder for you or does it get easier?

00:17.218 --> 00:19.060
It's always just a day at a time.

00:20.261 --> 00:21.282
I never measured it.

00:21.402 --> 00:28.789
In terms of being a continuing character, a literary character, I mean, there are any number of continuing characters in American fiction.

00:29.765 --> 00:37.314
No, I just write the story that's in my mind when I wake up on that day.

00:37.334 --> 00:39.176
You mean in terms of the plot?

00:39.897 --> 00:41.078
Just everything.

00:41.158 --> 00:43.921
I never plan a story.

00:46.184 --> 00:46.925
It's just there.

00:46.965 --> 00:47.966
It's always there.

00:47.986 --> 00:49.368
That's amazing.

00:49.508 --> 00:53.492
Tell me about how this, you've got this neo-Nazi type situation here.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.755
Tell me a little bit about the genesis of this.

00:57.592 --> 01:06.445
Well, I'm just troubled with that personally by maybe some historical currents that are at work in the country.

01:07.186 --> 01:08.448
It's a difficult time.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.895
Our cities are beset with very serious problems.

01:14.698 --> 01:21.508
Their clients, racial trouble, crime, urban decay as it's called.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.215
And people become tempted sometimes to

01:26.667 --> 01:55.493
seek facile and brutal solutions and those people are in our midst they'd like to wink at the constitution as dave says what tells me most nick is um their voices very strident voices that work today in the country i'm absolutely convinced they have an agenda which

01:55.996 --> 02:00.381
if we allow it to be carried out, will eviscerate our system.

02:00.802 --> 02:04.547
We're talking about the radical right in the United States.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.951
There are basically two Americans.

02:08.291 --> 02:16.542
There always have been two societies that work within our continental shores.

02:17.222 --> 02:20.326
One is humane, indecent, and civilized.

02:20.567 --> 02:21.668
The other is not.

02:22.890 --> 02:24.872
The spirit of vigilantism

02:25.207 --> 02:29.432
has its origins in colonial society.

02:29.452 --> 02:38.284
The America First Committee is a descendant of that more primitive time.

02:39.365 --> 02:50.339
But the essence of vigilanteism is based ultimately on violence and reactionary thinking.

02:50.359 --> 02:53.543
And at frontier times, there's some justification for

02:54.299 --> 02:59.924
They had no legal system, oftentimes on the edge of our society.

02:59.945 --> 03:10.575
Today, we see those descendants of the America First Committee, McCarthy, Harrow, take on another guy.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.418
Sometimes they're televangelists.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.341
Sometimes they're right-wing politicians.

03:17.041 --> 03:22.046
But their objection ultimately is to a pluralistic society.

03:22.066 --> 03:23.007
They cannot abide.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.815
That, in my opinion, is what's going on psychologically.

03:28.835 --> 03:37.965
The egalitarian dream of Jefferson, to which they pay lip service, is actually antithetical to everything they believe in.

03:38.826 --> 03:53.702
But they cannot accept a pluralistic society, one in which gays, blacks, white guys like us, Jews, Catholics, atheists, Orientals, gays, lesbians, women,

03:54.070 --> 03:56.874
all have an equal share.

03:56.894 --> 03:59.158
And that's what the Constitution guarantees.

03:59.238 --> 04:08.912
This is the Jeffersonian society, that all human beings are created equal in the society of God and underneath the governance of our republic.

04:09.733 --> 04:15.021
I think it's important to point out that this is not pandemic any particular region of the country either.

04:15.442 --> 04:16.784
No, it's not a region.

04:16.924 --> 04:22.272
Your novel, your man happens to be in New Iberia, but you're talking about

04:23.264 --> 04:25.907
phenomenon that's everywhere, isn't it?

04:25.927 --> 04:31.535
The temptation is always there.

04:31.555 --> 04:37.943
But the villain we meet in here represents cosmic evil.

04:37.963 --> 04:49.778
His flag might seem to be emblematic of some ideological cause, but he's evil in the corner.

04:52.036 --> 05:04.528
But in our own system, we always have that temptation, that moment to listen to the demagogue when we're angry or when we're fearful.

05:04.548 --> 05:07.411
And that's what Dave becomes concerned with in the book.

05:07.431 --> 05:09.493
We can always recognize Nazis.

05:09.513 --> 05:15.239
He invited somebody who's ugly and stupid with a shaved head and a swastika on his arm.

05:15.539 --> 05:16.900
There's a signal there.

05:17.881 --> 05:19.883
He's fairly recognized.

05:20.200 --> 05:32.537
But then you have a guy like David Duke who cleans up his act and gets cosmetic surgery and fixes his teeth and puts on a suit and talks.

05:32.557 --> 05:37.404
I mean, the transparency, the superficial one, they just want to come.

05:37.544 --> 05:48.739
But I wonder if that's the more nefarious... Well, that kind of fellow that is still a little kind of incidental.

05:49.732 --> 05:52.096
to the larger problem, which is historical.

05:53.518 --> 05:58.525
Again, it goes back to what we were talking about just a moment ago.

06:00.208 --> 06:07.318
There are two societies that live symbiotically within our culture and within the pages of our history books.

06:09.462 --> 06:14.770
We're a nation that rebuilt the countries of our enemies after World War II.

06:15.591 --> 06:18.175
We're the same nation that... Can I take that out of your way for you?

06:18.195 --> 06:18.515
Yes, ma'am.

06:18.535 --> 06:18.996
Thanks a million.

06:19.752 --> 06:35.506
the same nation that destroyed Iraq and then left its leader in place, encouraged the Kurds to rebel and then abandoned them, killed perhaps 100,000 civilians.

06:37.167 --> 06:44.313
This was the same nation that had been the ally of the Reagan-Bush administrations, all for one.

06:45.694 --> 06:48.797
If somebody can explain that to me, I believe

06:49.233 --> 06:50.995
be very interested in listening.

06:52.577 --> 06:56.483
Tell me about the fine line that you have to walk.

06:56.543 --> 07:05.935
I mean, as a writer of fiction, whose primary responsibility is to entertain, how do you balance these two?

07:06.035 --> 07:14.667
I mean, you clearly are disturbed by things that you see in society, domestically, and also in international things.

07:15.693 --> 07:22.039
How do you walk the line here to avoid being perceived as a pedantic writer?

07:22.500 --> 07:25.083
Because, I mean, you don't want to become boring either.

07:25.103 --> 07:44.282
Well, art requires craft, finally, whereby we talk about the struggle between good and evil in a way that's interesting and dramatic, and which in some way recreates the oldest story of the Judeo-Christian history.

07:45.173 --> 08:02.594
a tradition which is the fall of man from goodness, the blight that he brought upon this endemic place he was given, and which, for one reason or another, that he tainted through choice.

08:03.255 --> 08:14.168
This is not a biblical sermon, but the allegorical implication there in that early story in the Old Testament

08:14.738 --> 08:18.782
is the plot that makes an all-good tragedy.

08:19.723 --> 08:31.775
It's the source of the Renaissance in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero, from a lofty and elevated physician to one of humiliation and degradation.

08:31.795 --> 08:43.227
The story of Odysseus, or rather, you know, the blind king who solved the riddle of the Sphinx with his name.

08:44.995 --> 08:50.721
Yeah, the great tragic figure who blinded himself.

08:55.267 --> 08:58.490
You know, it's like the story of Prometheus.

08:59.852 --> 09:04.117
The tragic hero always precipitates his own doom.

09:04.137 --> 09:08.201
Well, the tragic hero always, by the way, is a good, a decent person, too.

09:09.022 --> 09:11.405
Well, he has to be a noble hero.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.467
He always has to be a flawed, doesn't he?

09:14.273 --> 09:25.549
In this book, we meet a character who represents evil on a metaphysical scale.

09:25.569 --> 09:28.333
It seems to be satanic.

09:28.353 --> 09:32.338
It's not a theological book, but the themes are mythic.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.182
It's about the ending of the millennium.

09:36.544 --> 09:40.509
It seems that the forces of good and evil are vying for control of the earth.

09:41.671 --> 09:43.774
Those evil forces are represented by

09:44.108 --> 09:47.251
neo-nazi buckhalter.

09:47.271 --> 09:58.883
But I do believe that there are people at work in our society that have one agenda, that is to destroy our faith in ourselves and in our institutions.

09:58.903 --> 10:02.146
And if we'll listen to them, their voice is always the same.

10:02.306 --> 10:03.407
Trust us.

10:03.427 --> 10:03.948
Trust us.

10:04.949 --> 10:10.454
If we listen to them, we'll get to see what the world of world buckhalter is all about.

10:11.656 --> 10:13.137
As Dave says, these were

10:13.522 --> 10:20.412
These are people who would make the louts, the shaved-head louts, and bully the caretaker of the side.

10:22.094 --> 10:41.301
In the last election, we heard people talking about rounding up the homeless, the struggle for the culture of America, rhetoric, and these televangelists who denigrate

10:42.175 --> 10:47.602
People who are different make scapegoats out of minorities.

10:47.622 --> 10:58.778
Nobody's going to make a scapegoat out of a black person anymore, but a gay becomes a likely and appealing alternative.

10:58.838 --> 11:02.443
Women, illegal immigrants.

11:02.783 --> 11:11.575
And then of course you have the scourge of AIDS, which so many of these people see as almost God's will.

11:12.145 --> 11:15.891
to these people that you're describing.

11:15.911 --> 11:20.318
I mean, this is happening because it's supposed to happen to these people.

11:20.358 --> 11:27.889
Well, that's an interesting thing, how people always take it upon themselves to interpret God's will.

11:27.949 --> 11:28.290
I know.

11:28.750 --> 11:40.228
I have a feeling that the law is tired of having all of these phenomena ascribed to him by people who have trouble

11:40.833 --> 11:41.855
Excuse me, go ahead.

11:41.875 --> 11:56.384
Are these things that profoundly bother you, or are you a writer feeling, you know, looking around out into society and this is what David's going to get involved in at this point, or are you really bothered?

11:56.424 --> 12:00.732
I mean, are these things that you're really responding to as a person first and then as a writer?

12:01.083 --> 12:03.105
Well, it'll bother me after I write about it.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.651
But that's what your art finally is about.

12:07.671 --> 12:14.459
It's the medium for your concern, for your perception about the world in which we live.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.441
Every writer tries to tell the truth.

12:16.782 --> 12:18.303
He knows it.

12:18.384 --> 12:19.805
It's a compulsion.

12:19.825 --> 12:20.446
It's an obsession.

12:20.606 --> 12:27.614
Orwell says the artist has the compulsion to correct history.

12:28.796 --> 12:29.757
Are all your books...

12:31.053 --> 12:32.615
a struggle between good and evil.

12:32.635 --> 12:33.617
Oh, yeah, always.

12:35.960 --> 12:46.516
And tell me about... Do you have to refresh yourself of what he's done and bring yourself... I know there's always a little couple paragraphs in there about what's gone before.

12:49.040 --> 12:58.253
Do you take pains to make sure that one book is consistent from one to the next in terms of the factual stuff for your characters?

12:59.735 --> 13:00.857
Well...

13:01.327 --> 13:04.651
I think of all the books as part of one story.

13:04.771 --> 13:05.231
Oh, really?

13:05.632 --> 13:08.395
Yeah, it's one ongoing story in reality.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.221
So he's going to keep going as long as you keep going?

13:14.241 --> 13:17.785
Well, I don't plan it.

13:17.805 --> 13:22.310
I just always, this is a fact.

13:22.370 --> 13:25.514
I get up in the morning with the story, and it's there.

13:26.174 --> 13:29.578
And I know what I'll be writing about that day, and I don't know what

13:29.845 --> 13:32.248
I'll be writing about tomorrow.

13:32.268 --> 13:33.870
Within the confines of the same book.

13:35.271 --> 13:40.357
Yeah, but... You didn't know where this was going when you started?

13:40.377 --> 13:40.437
No.

13:41.759 --> 13:46.264
But you knew vaguely that you had this larger theme that you would be doing.

13:46.284 --> 13:50.989
I just started with the submarine, the Nazi sub, sunk off the Louisiana coast.

13:51.049 --> 13:52.531
It's all that was in my mind.

13:53.552 --> 13:58.958
And I started it before the political campaign of 92.

14:00.119 --> 14:02.923
And I was bothered by things I was hearing.

14:02.943 --> 14:07.529
I was bothered by... I really believe it.

14:07.629 --> 14:16.060
I believe, like, right now, you see what... Bill Clinton won the election.

14:16.080 --> 14:29.637
And people who had had access to power, to the White House, to media attention that was beyond their wildest imaginings, found themselves ostracized.

14:30.055 --> 14:31.256
They're filled with rage.

14:32.738 --> 14:38.445
Also, they see society becoming, our society, becoming truly egalitarian.

14:39.726 --> 14:42.189
It makes them grind their back teeth.

14:42.209 --> 14:44.872
They're filled with anger.

14:44.892 --> 14:50.759
And they're going to, in effect, rescind that election if they can.

14:50.779 --> 14:57.447
And they have no issue to run on except to degrade those whom they fear.

14:57.899 --> 14:59.381
I've never seen anything like this.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.383
You can tell me not in my large time.

15:01.403 --> 15:08.011
I did an interview with Gary Wills a couple of weeks ago, and he said, hey, it's always been like this.

15:08.031 --> 15:09.632
He said, they called Lincoln an ape.

15:09.652 --> 15:22.487
They accused Washington of trying to institute, make himself a king, and Jefferson was accused of being an adulterer with a black slave and blah, blah, blah.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.850
But this is pretty vicious.

15:24.910 --> 15:27.653
This stuff, this white water thing is a nothing issue.

15:28.105 --> 15:30.288
Paula Jones is a bimbo wannabe.

15:30.328 --> 15:32.090
Where she's coming from is beyond me.

15:33.051 --> 15:37.856
These people on television, there's Pat Robertson, there's a particularly female president.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.779
What the hell are they?

15:39.799 --> 15:41.120
I mean, I think you're absolutely right.

15:41.140 --> 15:48.169
I think that this is, you know, one way to avoid getting these programs in.

15:48.369 --> 15:50.992
All of his positions, I guess, are under attack.

15:51.012 --> 15:54.035
And whether or not he's going to make it as arguable.

15:54.055 --> 15:54.516
We'll see.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.098
I don't know.

15:56.178 --> 15:57.960
They wish to destroy the man.

15:59.054 --> 16:01.317
He's everything they detest.

16:02.158 --> 16:04.942
Number one, he comes from a blue-collar background.

16:05.043 --> 16:07.266
He became a Yale law graduate.

16:07.286 --> 16:07.807
He's educated.

16:07.827 --> 16:09.689
He's a Rhodes scholar.

16:09.809 --> 16:21.106
They despise intellectuals, particularly one who rises from his background into circles of power, in which they consider him their bailiwick.

16:21.346 --> 16:23.489
And he has an intelligent, assertive life, too.

16:24.170 --> 16:26.293
Well, there's stuff they can't accept.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.858
of our woman attorney general.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.081
I'm sorry.

16:31.402 --> 16:33.565
Can I give you any coffee, cappuccino, espresso?

16:33.605 --> 16:34.206
Nothing.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.011
I'm not for me, ma'am.

16:37.091 --> 16:38.193
No, I appreciate it.

16:38.213 --> 16:38.774
Thank you, ma'am.

16:38.794 --> 16:42.560
You're welcome.

16:42.580 --> 16:44.764
But I think that's what's at work.

16:46.627 --> 16:53.698
And if these people had their work, we would not have the kind of society we have today.

16:54.269 --> 16:57.973
We would have one in which a few people had voice.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.375
A few people would have a voice.

17:02.037 --> 17:11.806
And it would be one in which a discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots would be even more dramatic than it is now.

17:12.427 --> 17:14.809
This is what the Reagan era was about.

17:14.829 --> 17:20.715
It was about rescinding all the social gains of the last 50 years.

17:21.438 --> 17:25.082
turning back the clock, reallocating the capital.

17:25.102 --> 17:27.324
That's what went on.

17:27.344 --> 17:29.827
I remember a quote, I can't recall where it came from before.

17:29.887 --> 17:35.273
Reagan made people feel comfortable about their business.

17:35.453 --> 17:40.138
What a wonderful observation that was.

17:41.079 --> 17:48.848
I lost my train here for something.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.770
Pick up on anything while I'm thinking of you.

17:51.340 --> 18:07.561
The novel deals with the situation in Louisiana, but it's meant to be a treatment of our times, of our era, and their millennial themes.

18:08.342 --> 18:12.066
The preacher we meet.

18:12.086 --> 18:14.670
The preacher's a character, isn't he?

18:14.690 --> 18:19.035
Yeah, he's an interesting guy who believes that maybe some evil force

18:19.488 --> 18:21.490
is being released upon the earth.

18:22.271 --> 18:34.566
And he mentions the prophecy in the Book of Revelation and the prophecy about God, G-O-G, and Magog out of the Old Testament.

18:34.587 --> 18:48.043
And, of course, that millennial fear is characteristic in the Western world whenever we reach even the end of the century and certainly the end of the millennia in the literature of the

18:48.648 --> 18:56.657
end of the 11th century, people began to see all kinds of signs.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.661
Things were ending.

18:59.681 --> 19:03.806
Of course, we stumbled on for a hundred thousand years.

19:03.826 --> 19:11.735
Tell me a little bit about, I mean, they told me this, I think the first printing here is 75,000, which is great.

19:11.755 --> 19:13.557
Yeah, it's been very successful.

19:14.198 --> 19:17.522
And each one is more successful than the previous one, I guess.

19:17.542 --> 19:18.503
This one's a big one.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.787
Yeah, it hit the Publishers Weekly bestseller list last year.

19:22.827 --> 19:23.548
Oh, congratulations.

19:23.568 --> 19:24.028
That's nice.

19:24.809 --> 19:26.331
Did you see USA Today?

19:26.512 --> 19:26.772
No.

19:27.152 --> 19:30.897
He put my picture in the paper two days running.

19:31.017 --> 19:32.560
Yeah, there's a big spread.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.361
Wow.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.262
It's today?

19:34.602 --> 19:35.784
Yeah, yesterday ended.

19:35.804 --> 19:36.545
Well, I'll pick it up.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.668
I picked it up.

19:38.848 --> 19:39.509
Yeah.

19:40.690 --> 19:41.451
Really, that's great.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.753
Yeah, it's a big spread.

19:42.873 --> 19:45.857
Time Magazine is doing a spread, I think, next week.

19:46.580 --> 19:54.112
Well, how does that make you feel for a guy that, I mean, you want to look really from one extreme to the next.

19:54.132 --> 19:59.280
I mean, I forget the number, but you had a book that was rejected by, what, 50 or 60?

19:59.520 --> 20:00.141
Oh, it was 100.

20:00.422 --> 20:01.824
It was 100 publishers.

20:01.844 --> 20:04.127
Can I get a check, man, whenever you have time?

20:04.147 --> 20:04.588
Thanks.

20:04.923 --> 20:06.905
Now you've got a book on the bestseller list.

20:06.925 --> 20:07.486
Yeah.

20:07.726 --> 20:08.547
Tell me a little bit.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.188
I mean, is there wisdom to be gained here?

20:10.208 --> 20:14.313
I mean, is popularity a fleeting kind of a thing?

20:14.393 --> 20:18.617
I mean, are you writing that differently from the way you did with the book?

20:18.637 --> 20:21.901
Well, I think the writing is better today.

20:22.241 --> 20:24.283
The themes are larger and I'm older.

20:25.304 --> 20:30.229
But fashion and success are fickle companions.

20:32.011 --> 20:32.972
Do you hear from readers?

20:33.273 --> 20:34.455
Oh, a lot, yeah.

20:34.615 --> 20:37.880
Do they respond to a tough theme like this?

20:38.040 --> 20:38.561
Oh, yeah.

20:39.001 --> 20:39.923
Negatively?

20:39.943 --> 20:46.132
I mean, you know, I get hundreds of fan letters, and they're wonderful.

20:46.693 --> 20:49.798
That's why I get a strange letter, but it's rare.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.685
You live in Louisiana?

20:54.925 --> 20:56.187
And Missoula, yeah.

20:56.207 --> 20:58.811
I remember when you were up in Montana.

20:58.831 --> 20:59.732
Yeah, that's right.

21:00.473 --> 21:00.934
And...

21:02.095 --> 21:04.438
Chuck, I mean, picking the place.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.060
I mean, you've lived all over the country.

21:07.662 --> 21:10.286
Is Louisiana a metaphor for anything?

21:10.306 --> 21:18.617
Or how important is a place like Louisiana in your writing for you?

21:18.637 --> 21:20.940
Well, it's a place I love to write about, Nick.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.103
It's a place I'm closest to.

21:23.944 --> 21:30.212
But a good story, a good novel, is going to use the place...

21:30.732 --> 21:37.743
only as a symbol for the territory in which every man, the medieval protagonist, lives.

21:38.244 --> 21:50.343
The moral landscape doesn't have anything of geographic singularity about moral landscapes in the heart.

21:52.987 --> 21:54.609
Thank you, ma'am.

21:54.629 --> 21:55.170
You're welcome.

21:57.968 --> 21:58.709
What is Dave for you?

21:59.029 --> 22:01.732
Is Dave a character or has he alone?

22:03.033 --> 22:10.060
Maybe you could just tell me what Dave is for you.

22:10.340 --> 22:16.627
Does Dave grow with you as a character?

22:17.528 --> 22:24.735
I mean, he's certainly not fixed in time like so many of the other continuing characters that you see.

22:25.205 --> 22:28.048
to have an organic experience.

22:28.068 --> 22:32.312
He's growing and he's living and things are happening from book to book.

22:32.993 --> 22:34.595
Tell me a little bit about him.

22:34.655 --> 22:40.541
I mean, the obvious question, do you see him as an expression of yourself or an ideal self?

22:41.041 --> 22:44.985
Does he represent the things that you'd like to be?

22:45.165 --> 22:47.368
Tell me just a little bit about him as a character.

22:47.868 --> 22:54.655
Well, he's the chivalric protagonist and he's a decent and kind person.

22:55.478 --> 23:07.650
And he tries to give voice to those who are disenfranchised, those who are politically powerless to the poor, those who are vulnerable and inept.

23:07.670 --> 23:10.753
And ideally, that's what a police officer does.

23:11.794 --> 23:20.562
But he feels charged to befriend those who are less fortunate than he.

23:20.583 --> 23:24.186
And that, in essence, is the ethos of the night he ran.

23:24.858 --> 23:42.883
the medieval figure out of the charles syrian legend um and then of course his pal cleat cleat see the last shades of good at that there i mean he's actually

23:43.150 --> 23:45.934
He's basically the Gordian Knot kind of a guy.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.056
He does all those things.

23:48.597 --> 23:49.919
I don't know my room number yet.

23:49.939 --> 23:50.479
That's quite all right.

23:50.499 --> 23:52.041
I can just find out and talk.

23:52.081 --> 23:53.163
That's the last name Burke?

23:53.243 --> 23:53.804
Yes, ma'am.

23:53.864 --> 23:54.064
Excellent.

23:54.084 --> 23:54.745
There's no problem.

23:54.805 --> 23:55.706
Thank you very much.

23:55.786 --> 23:56.948
I sure appreciate it.

23:56.968 --> 23:57.448
No problem.

23:57.468 --> 24:01.674
Thank you.

24:01.694 --> 24:09.664
We're talking about cleat, I guess, and his function as, I guess, a foil for... Yeah.

24:12.108 --> 24:21.136
Going back to your observation earlier about the energy from coming, the similarities with Greek tragedy.

24:21.776 --> 24:31.525
Greek tragedy always assumed or always purported that life, we lived by such a slender thread, so fragile.

24:31.965 --> 24:35.648
And we see this with the tenuous, for instance.

24:35.908 --> 24:41.473
I mean, there are no certainties in life.

24:42.820 --> 24:46.844
They go from day to day and understanding this.

24:47.205 --> 24:54.933
And I guess you energize the novel, your novels, with this understanding of the fragility of life, I guess.

24:56.875 --> 24:59.358
Well, Dave's always aware of mortality.

24:59.378 --> 25:02.542
Mortality is another way of saying it.

25:02.562 --> 25:10.350
And the evil characters whom he encounters always are invested in greed.

25:11.351 --> 25:12.793
They're driven by greed.

25:13.583 --> 25:18.649
And greed is our way of denying more talent.

25:18.669 --> 25:23.134
Materialism can only be validated by denial of our deaths.

25:24.636 --> 25:35.168
And the most terrible moment of recognition for a venal person is the fact that, in truth, he cannot take it with him.

25:35.188 --> 25:40.915
I love what Earl K. Long once said about his lack of desire for money, because he never cared about it.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.797
He said,

25:43.064 --> 25:44.786
If I go to heaven, I won't need it.

25:44.806 --> 25:46.929
If I go to the other place, it'll burn up.

25:47.610 --> 26:06.456
I guess when you're motivated by considerations of the grand things, good and evil, it certainly does, whereas traditional

26:08.258 --> 26:09.860
P.I.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.600
kinds of books.

26:10.660 --> 26:14.104
I mean, they don't take on such weighty things, do they?

26:14.124 --> 26:14.964
I mean, they're not novels.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.328
This is a traditional, you write traditional novels.

26:18.628 --> 26:19.869
Dave's never a P.I.

26:20.229 --> 26:28.837
He's never a P.I., but I mean, isn't that kind of a, that's what they call him, a P.I.

26:28.958 --> 26:36.865
It's a crime novel, but you see, the novels I've written over the years, and I wrote my first book,

26:37.132 --> 26:42.300
publishable novel in 1960, you know, 34 years ago.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.824
I never changed subjects.

26:46.346 --> 26:48.630
All I changed was the voice.

26:48.850 --> 26:56.902
Dave Robichaux, police officer, narrates the books in the series, but the subject has never changed.

26:56.922 --> 27:00.688
The same theme, same character, same places were always there.

27:01.189 --> 27:03.392
My first novel dealt with a black

27:03.794 --> 27:14.510
Prizefighter ends up in a penitentiary and a white moonshiner who becomes his friend and a country singer addicted to speed.

27:14.530 --> 27:16.673
I wrote that when I was 23 years old.

27:17.655 --> 27:20.780
Is that the one that you had difficulty placing on the house?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.223
No, it only took me four years.

27:23.744 --> 27:24.585
Four years?

27:24.705 --> 27:27.169
That's kind of like a breeze for me.

27:27.510 --> 27:33.058
The Lost Get Back Boogie dealt with a guy who was being released from Angola Pen.

27:33.612 --> 27:42.825
who goes up to Montana and gets involved, and I'll fight with a company that's polluting the Missoula Valley.

27:42.845 --> 27:50.016
And that would be rejected just around 100 times over a nine-year period.

27:50.036 --> 27:54.081
It never occurred to you that maybe you should be doing something else?

27:54.142 --> 27:55.163
I never thought I could.

27:55.403 --> 27:58.548
What does that keep you going with those sorts of things?

27:59.309 --> 28:03.535
It was very frustrating, but I could never imagine myself not riding.

28:03.987 --> 28:06.530
I couldn't do something else.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.974
So I did other things to make a living.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.597
And I enjoyed most of them.

28:12.579 --> 28:17.886
But I knew I wasn't working at what I was supposed to do, which was to write.

28:18.487 --> 28:21.431
I never had a doubt about what I was supposed to be doing.

28:22.913 --> 28:25.657
And you never changed your own expression.

28:25.717 --> 28:32.526
You didn't say, well, gee, maybe I'm not appealing to the... I guess this...

28:32.793 --> 28:34.175
This raises a question.

28:34.195 --> 28:36.117
Do you see a reader out there?

28:36.137 --> 28:37.218
Do you have a reader in line?

28:37.258 --> 28:38.780
No.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.282
No, it's just like pitching.

28:40.342 --> 28:43.846
You think the ball into the catcher's clock.

28:43.866 --> 28:47.170
You think the ball into the catcher's clock.

28:47.190 --> 28:53.177
And if you miss the strike zone, it's because you're not thinking the ball into the catcher's clock.

28:53.197 --> 28:54.238
And ours is the same one.

28:54.378 --> 28:55.880
That's a great quote.

28:56.521 --> 28:56.841
Yeah.

28:58.002 --> 29:00.265
I'm looking for these good quotes.

29:00.285 --> 29:01.246
That's a good question.

29:01.546 --> 29:02.007
Thank you.

29:02.257 --> 29:07.784
What's our schedule?

29:07.885 --> 29:09.367
I've got another interview.

29:10.889 --> 29:11.770
I've got two more.

29:11.850 --> 29:12.891
I've got one and three.

29:13.112 --> 29:15.014
Okay, so we've got about 15 minutes.

29:15.034 --> 29:15.935
Yeah, yeah.

29:17.478 --> 29:21.964
Maybe... Just in case there are any questions.

29:22.164 --> 29:22.645
Okay.

29:24.147 --> 29:27.751
So again, we were talking about when Dave started.

29:28.332 --> 29:30.215
I mean, has your success surprised you?

29:30.916 --> 29:31.116
Yeah.

29:32.024 --> 29:42.095
I made failure a way of life so long I felt comfortable.

29:42.115 --> 29:43.196
Do you have any insight?

29:43.397 --> 29:53.688
I mean, is the public fickle, or does it just, how can, maybe it wasn't the public, maybe it was the publishing houses that wouldn't give you a shot, you know?

29:53.708 --> 29:57.492
Is there a comment to be made there?

29:58.214 --> 30:03.062
It becomes eventually a fella's time.

30:03.623 --> 30:04.504
That's what happens.

30:04.585 --> 30:05.767
It's your time.

30:06.027 --> 30:06.828
It's just your time.

30:07.770 --> 30:12.277
I had a lot of success when I was younger, but it went away from me.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.087
But there's just a time when it happens.

30:18.107 --> 30:24.778
Maybe the best writer in the country is Ron Hanson, and it's going to be Ron Hanson's time.

30:25.180 --> 30:29.907
Ron Hanson is like Babe Ruth standing in the middle of Yankee Stadium.

30:31.269 --> 30:33.852
And some people see him, but most of the crowd hasn't.

30:34.313 --> 30:35.495
One day they will.

30:35.515 --> 30:37.437
It's like Cormac McCarthy.

30:38.719 --> 30:40.201
Cormac's a great writer.

30:41.523 --> 30:43.346
He's on the bestseller list.

30:43.526 --> 30:46.871
He used to sell 4,000 copies for years.

30:46.931 --> 30:48.112
I don't know Hanson's work.

30:49.334 --> 30:51.918
Marriott in Ecstasy is his last book.

30:52.098 --> 30:54.141
Story of the Nun with the Stigmata.

30:54.509 --> 30:57.934
Maybe the best writer working in America today.

30:57.954 --> 30:58.555
You feel that?

30:58.795 --> 30:59.096
Yeah.

31:02.921 --> 31:03.502
Who's he with?

31:03.522 --> 31:04.423
Who's his publisher?

31:04.443 --> 31:05.285
Do you know offhand?

31:06.266 --> 31:07.388
Good question.

31:07.708 --> 31:09.030
I don't know.

31:09.050 --> 31:10.312
Let me also ask you.

31:10.332 --> 31:18.103
Now, I know you've written non-Dave books, but are you basically a Dave?

31:18.421 --> 31:21.307
but you say that you're writing gay books pretty much from now on?

31:21.948 --> 31:22.549
Well, I don't know.

31:22.690 --> 31:31.107
I write, I publish short stories and essays during the year, but nobody reads them.

31:31.387 --> 31:35.656
Never going to live, right?

31:35.676 --> 31:37.139
I guess there's a comment that you made here.

31:37.339 --> 31:39.163
I think that maybe you can find

31:40.797 --> 31:44.801
a medium, a way of expressing what you feel with this character.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.504
Maybe you don't have to go and come up with that.

31:47.524 --> 31:49.086
Oh, I'm very happy with the books.

31:49.887 --> 31:54.772
I believe they're the best books I've written.

31:54.792 --> 31:57.636
I really think these are the books I was always meant to write.

31:58.777 --> 32:02.881
They've had obvious influences on people.

32:02.941 --> 32:08.087
People come to signings and say that the books help them with, you know, with recovery.

32:08.388 --> 32:14.774
help them find 12-step groups, and there are not many authors who receive that kind of reward from their work.

32:15.395 --> 32:25.946
You're pretty open about your own, and it's kind of, you're not supposed to talk about that, right, I guess, in 12 Steps and all this.

32:26.006 --> 32:37.197
Well, people in my fellowship are asked us not to represent the organization by name at the level of media, so we refer to it as simply a 12-step fellowship.

32:38.678 --> 32:43.284
But I mean, you have no reservations about... To be personally?

32:43.304 --> 32:44.105
No, not at all.

32:44.466 --> 32:46.008
About talking about it.

32:46.028 --> 32:46.328
Oh, no.

32:47.049 --> 32:47.910
And writing about it.

32:47.970 --> 32:48.972
No, of course not.

32:48.992 --> 32:49.652
Is it true?

32:49.713 --> 32:54.359
I did an interview with Elia Kazan a couple of years ago.

32:54.379 --> 33:02.269
He said, Jim, you write about yourself, either fictionally or... You make yourself naked.

33:02.289 --> 33:04.993
You expose yourself to the world.

33:05.193 --> 33:05.293
Yeah.

33:05.527 --> 33:13.816
Do you feel similarly, I mean, that when you actually sit down the way, honestly, you really do have to expose the wounds, I guess.

33:13.936 --> 33:15.498
I don't know if I'm fixing my metaphors.

33:15.678 --> 33:17.160
No, that's right.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.744
If that's the case, it certainly doesn't bother me.

33:21.244 --> 33:31.435
But I think that kind of sensitivity, with all respect to these other gentlemen, is based a little bit on a vain misperception.

33:32.697 --> 33:34.639
Because nobody's really watching us.

33:35.193 --> 33:39.639
We think they're watching us, but people are not watching us.

33:39.659 --> 33:44.666
They're worried about their own lives, as they should be.

33:45.908 --> 33:54.540
And there's nothing any of us is capable of telling the rest of the human family about that is very near.

33:55.481 --> 34:00.248
When you say that these are all part of one work, it's a corpus, obviously.

34:00.268 --> 34:01.690
So Dave is going...

34:02.125 --> 34:04.688
Someplace where you don't know where he's going.

34:05.028 --> 34:06.570
No, no I don't.

34:07.150 --> 34:07.711
I never do.

34:09.393 --> 34:15.219
And when it concludes, do you think it will be a terminus or does he terminate with you?

34:15.439 --> 34:19.003
I never, I just never have an idea where the story's going.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.124
I just don't know.

34:21.085 --> 34:23.407
I never see him into the next day.

34:24.689 --> 34:29.854
For instance, when his first wife died so viciously, I think.

34:30.914 --> 34:35.661
I mean, a lot of people might be... Of course, you have to give them this baggage.

34:35.861 --> 34:38.185
They carry this baggage in pain.

34:38.325 --> 34:43.252
But when you kill off a character like that, does it bother you?

34:43.493 --> 34:44.254
I mean, personally?

34:45.075 --> 34:50.744
Well, I don't feel that I precipitate the action again.

34:51.044 --> 34:52.346
The story's already written.

34:53.327 --> 35:00.398
And that book, Heaven's Prisoners, was based in part on a violent intrusion into our own lives.

35:00.631 --> 35:05.138
His biographical origin, you see.

35:07.942 --> 35:17.617
And where his current wife and his sweetheart live so tenuously, you almost feel, I mean, a bad diagnosis could come in at any time.

35:18.318 --> 35:22.344
Well, it's true, but it's also something that's been in our lives.

35:23.206 --> 35:25.930
It's not fiction.

35:26.431 --> 35:28.714
I didn't write it out of imagination.

35:29.521 --> 35:36.350
Much of the material is biographical.

35:36.370 --> 35:45.181
So you are really writing novels that are based on things that happen in your own life.

35:46.823 --> 35:48.886
Is this kind of an autobiography in a way?

35:49.887 --> 35:57.317
I don't think of it in that way because very often people will not recognize the experience

35:58.107 --> 36:01.050
because it's portrayed in an oblique fashion.

36:01.331 --> 36:02.212
That's what art is.

36:02.232 --> 36:07.878
It's an oblique expression of events that have already happened in your life.

36:09.320 --> 36:19.912
But you write about them in a medium that redefines reality in such a way that the reader, the viewer, becomes a participant.

36:19.932 --> 36:22.155
He sees himself within this story.

36:22.756 --> 36:26.460
Autobiography becomes a pain exercise.

36:27.149 --> 36:39.261
When writers find themselves writing their memoirs, they enter into the area of the ego as a role rather than into the area of the artist.

36:39.921 --> 36:42.023
Art is empathetic by nature.

36:43.225 --> 36:52.213
The person who writes the journal and the diary begins to use first-person pronouns like 10 feet high.

36:53.014 --> 36:54.996
So is it a pretty good ride for you right now?

36:55.448 --> 36:56.309
Everything's great.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.691
It has been for a long time.

36:58.831 --> 36:59.091
Yeah.

36:59.912 --> 37:04.696
If it all went away tomorrow, I'd still be a very happy person.

37:04.716 --> 37:05.297
Happy man.

37:05.417 --> 37:09.360
I love Phil Crosby's comment on Today Show one day.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.203
The way I look at it is I'm playing with house money.

37:12.723 --> 37:14.144
We're playing on the house money.

37:14.164 --> 37:15.686
Yeah, you know, it's a good line.

37:15.746 --> 37:17.447
I'm playing with house money right now.

37:17.908 --> 37:19.169
Nick, can we start walking?

37:19.189 --> 37:23.653
Yeah, I don't know if this fella is calling.

37:23.673 --> 37:24.173
He's calling.
