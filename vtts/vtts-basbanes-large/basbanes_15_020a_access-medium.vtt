00:03.946 --> 00:30.392
All right, how are you?

00:30.710 --> 00:31.771
Nick Bazman, Michael.

00:32.172 --> 00:33.033
How are you?

00:33.053 --> 00:33.995
It's good to see you.

00:34.155 --> 00:38.000
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

00:38.180 --> 00:44.089
What students did you introduce themselves and tell them what was in the school newspaper?

00:44.169 --> 00:44.970
Amy, what did you tell me?

00:45.030 --> 00:47.894
I'm Amy Cairo, and I'm the executive editor.

00:48.495 --> 00:49.657
Great.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.458
I'm Eric Arnold.

00:50.478 --> 00:51.038
I'm the editor.

00:52.140 --> 00:52.841
I'm not a student.

00:52.861 --> 00:54.764
I'm Tom Wernstein.

00:55.064 --> 00:57.928
Kevin Schwartz, I'm the editor of the magazine.

00:58.489 --> 00:59.991
Scott Lepstein, I'm also the executive editor.

01:00.410 --> 01:01.271
I'm Kevin Chester.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.454
I'm a new designer.

01:03.474 --> 01:04.375
Great.

01:04.396 --> 01:04.496
Okay.

01:04.596 --> 01:11.926
Well, I'd like to welcome you here at Rosman High School on behalf of the students and on behalf of the vegans.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.969
How does it feel to be back?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.152
Great.

01:16.172 --> 01:16.432
It's great.

01:16.452 --> 01:17.213
Terrific.

01:17.233 --> 01:18.215
It's really nice, you know.

01:19.677 --> 01:24.103
I mean, sometimes you go back to places and you wish you didn't, but this seems really nice.

01:25.545 --> 01:27.868
Of course, I'm not a student here anymore.

01:28.270 --> 01:36.282
Do you have any special memories of your days as a student in Part HF?

01:36.302 --> 01:40.809
You know, my recollection is that this was really a terrific place.

01:41.110 --> 01:44.094
It was a really, really good school.

01:44.134 --> 01:54.991
It was a time when students were really serious and the parents were really serious about doing well in school and going on to college.

01:56.473 --> 01:57.214
So it was

01:57.785 --> 02:08.056
It was a place where there wasn't a lot of fooling around, and we all got really good educations and had a great time.

02:08.417 --> 02:12.902
On the basketball team, we had a new coach.

02:13.282 --> 02:14.403
His name was Joe Letera.

02:14.423 --> 02:18.888
I think he was the head of athletics here for a long time, but he's retired now.

02:20.670 --> 02:26.197
But he came out of the inner city someplace and did JV, and we were on the JV.

02:26.217 --> 02:27.538
And I remember at one point,

02:27.890 --> 02:33.315
He didn't think we were doing so well, and he said to us, boys, we're going to build character by winning.

02:33.336 --> 02:38.721
You know, it was like... Well, you've got to wait in 1960 and 1995 now.

02:38.781 --> 02:40.263
What does that mean for something that you've visited?

02:43.546 --> 02:48.491
Well, I thought it would be really nice to see, you know, for me to go back.

02:48.971 --> 02:55.618
I mean, this is very selfish in terms of my wanting to go back and see

02:56.678 --> 02:58.841
my old school and sort of where I came from.

02:58.861 --> 03:01.144
I mean, this may happen a lot.

03:01.224 --> 03:11.418
You may have sort of strange-looking older people stumbling around trying to find their way and, yeah.

03:11.438 --> 03:12.639
The speech you gave to the U.S.

03:12.679 --> 03:16.564
National Press Club discussed what you felt was the near extinction of the American media.

03:17.185 --> 03:20.830
What do you feel that a paper like The Beacon, our own paper, can do to combat this problem?

03:23.847 --> 03:33.323
Well, I remember... My recollection to The Beacon was it was just really hard just to get it out at all, you know.

03:34.706 --> 03:47.167
But, you know, the more... It seems to me the more you're dealing in local news, I mean, the more sort of direct your contact is with your audience.

03:47.247 --> 03:49.551
And I think the experience of...

03:50.054 --> 04:00.884
school newspapers or town newspapers is really different from the experience of national media, which, in my sense, is they're more and more lost.

04:01.204 --> 04:02.125
They don't know what they're doing.

04:02.145 --> 04:04.347
I mean, they're here, photographing us.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.689
It's just that was important.

04:07.009 --> 04:16.918
Just starting medicine at Harvard for eight years, what made you decide to become an author instead of a doctor?

04:16.938 --> 04:18.880
You know, it was really just an accident.

04:20.277 --> 04:35.012
I was paying my way through medical school writing books because I had written for the Beacon and I wrote for the Roslin News.

04:35.032 --> 04:36.154
Is the Roslin News still here?

04:36.414 --> 04:38.056
It used to be right down the hill.

04:38.116 --> 04:43.181
So I wrote sports for the Roslin News and also photographed the games.

04:45.864 --> 04:48.867
And I had this experience of

04:49.825 --> 04:53.190
sort of working journalism.

04:53.230 --> 04:59.398
My dad was a journalist, and my idea of the way to earn a living was writing.

05:00.880 --> 05:13.978
So when I was in medical school, I only had vacations and things like that to work, so I would write paperback spy stories to pay for medical school during the vacations.

05:16.422 --> 05:18.685
It was a big secret, because I didn't want anybody to know

05:18.985 --> 05:29.119
But at a certain point, I realized that I was more interested in... I had begun by writing these books in order to pay for the education to become a doctor.

05:30.280 --> 05:36.409
And at some point in the four years, I realized that I didn't really care about being a doctor anymore.

05:36.429 --> 05:37.610
I cared more about the writing.

05:37.630 --> 05:41.496
And instead of making notes on the patients, I was making notes on how the doctors were behaving.

05:43.198 --> 05:44.740
I was going to put it in a book.

05:46.053 --> 05:48.896
Lots of people talk about which of your books they like best.

05:49.156 --> 05:50.097
Do you have a favorite?

05:50.697 --> 05:51.338
I like Travels.

05:52.699 --> 05:53.320
Yeah.

05:53.340 --> 06:03.629
But I think it's because... Because I got to do that sort of, you know, completely egotistical focus on yourself.

06:03.969 --> 06:05.751
Which of your books do you like?

06:07.292 --> 06:08.333
Which I like least?

06:11.276 --> 06:12.437
Hmm.

06:12.457 --> 06:13.478
You know, um...

06:16.715 --> 06:17.856
The Terminal Man, I think.

06:21.041 --> 06:24.906
It's funny about the books that don't work out.

06:25.086 --> 06:27.889
I did nine drafts of The Terminal Man.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.271
I could never get it straight.

06:29.391 --> 06:31.915
It just kept slipping away from me.

06:32.115 --> 06:36.160
I would send it to people and give it to people and ask my friends to read it.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.563
No one could figure out what was wrong with it.

06:40.005 --> 06:46.333
I looked at it not too long ago because I was sort of going through making corrections and all of them.

06:46.718 --> 06:47.719
I had the same reaction.

06:47.739 --> 06:50.584
I thought, there's something wrong with this, and I don't have any idea of what.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.266
Do you wish you could go back and revise it?

06:52.406 --> 06:53.868
I don't know how.

06:54.008 --> 06:56.832
I don't know what I would resist it.

06:58.815 --> 07:04.524
My feeling is a little bit like the affection that you have as a parent for your kids that don't turn out quite right.

07:05.465 --> 07:11.173
In a way, you like them best, because they're such screw-ups.

07:13.381 --> 07:15.003
You mentioned your favorite book was Travels.

07:15.123 --> 07:23.174
In the end of Travels, you describe a period in your life where you're going through supernatural experiences, like auras and spoon bending and things of the like.

07:23.614 --> 07:28.320
Could you explain what was going on during that period of your life, really?

07:28.341 --> 07:30.023
You mean, instead of what I said?

07:30.063 --> 07:32.926
Well, what exactly was going on then?

07:33.627 --> 07:34.208
It was true.

07:34.228 --> 07:35.690
I mean, that was just what was happening.

07:35.830 --> 07:40.997
And I wrote the book, I think, in 86.

07:41.017 --> 07:43.320
And when it was published, I was teaching at MIT.

07:44.313 --> 07:56.967
So the thing about psychics and parapsychology was published, and I was at MIT, the bastion of not that kind of thinking.

07:57.047 --> 08:06.077
And what was really interesting is that I was teaching a writing class, and all the students thought, yeah, fine, OK, sure.

08:06.097 --> 08:07.940
And there was almost no interest in it.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.063
But the faculty was really angry.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.236
And I thought for a while I was going to lose some friends.

08:14.617 --> 08:19.385
What can I tell you?

08:19.405 --> 08:35.451
I went into this whole area with complete skepticism and emerged with a lot of surprising sense that there was more to it than I thought.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.493
I thought there was nothing to it.

08:38.060 --> 08:44.929
Have you modeled any of your characters on yourself or people that you know aside from your non-fiction?

08:47.192 --> 08:58.127
Well, John Carter in ER is certainly me at one time and Dr. Green is me if I were a doctor, I guess.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.931
Although in the new season he's not doing as well as I'm.

09:00.951 --> 09:03.474
I don't want him to.

09:03.494 --> 09:06.919
In the new season he's having some problems and I'm trying to... It's interesting how I...

09:08.840 --> 09:11.602
I want to improve him because I have this feeling about him.

09:13.484 --> 09:14.925
It's some identification.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.147
Do you do a lot of writing for me, Arthur?

09:17.167 --> 09:17.367
No.

09:18.629 --> 09:18.829
I don't.

09:19.109 --> 09:21.011
I try not to do anything, actually.

09:21.031 --> 09:25.174
Do you plan on writing again as the first episode?

09:25.194 --> 09:37.345
You know, I wanted to write another episode this year, and I may still do it, but it's really... It's very hard in terms of scheduling.

09:39.164 --> 09:44.729
Who have been your literary influences?

09:45.210 --> 09:57.741
The biggest ones for me were Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Robert Louis Stevenson.

09:58.262 --> 10:06.910
I was really always very attracted to people who told stories, you know,

10:07.531 --> 10:19.425
I don't mean it in the sense of pulp, but I mean a kind of people whose primary focus was storytelling and psychology or something.

10:19.445 --> 10:28.095
I mean, those are people who are not brought to be very literary, except Poe is in France, but that's because he's in translation.

10:28.115 --> 10:32.940
What modern authors do you read now?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.382
I read a lot of them.

10:37.450 --> 10:46.725
I'm trying to think of who... You know, it's the kind of question, as soon as you ask, I can't think of, you know, it's like, what movies have you seen lately?

10:46.765 --> 10:50.111
I can't, my brain, I must have seen some, you know.

10:51.794 --> 10:52.495
I can't think.

10:52.996 --> 11:03.373
You know, but I think one answer to your question is, because I do this as work,

11:03.927 --> 11:09.915
The writers that I read, I tend to read in a certain kind of neutral way.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.437
It's the same way as in movies.

11:11.457 --> 11:13.740
You know, people always say, well, what did you think of this movie or that movie?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.542
Wasn't this movie bad or good or something?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.204
I'm kind of interested in all of it.

11:18.626 --> 11:21.229
And kind of not interested in all of it.

11:21.249 --> 11:26.296
But I'm interested in how other people make work decisions.

11:27.177 --> 11:29.580
Well, you're obviously a very popular author.

11:29.915 --> 11:36.164
When you sit down to write a book, are you trying to write, like, the great novel or the popular novel?

11:36.184 --> 11:36.945
Neither one, really.

11:37.025 --> 11:40.691
I don't know how to say it.

11:40.711 --> 11:43.274
I'm always surprised that people are interested in what I do.

11:44.476 --> 11:51.567
Because usually, when I'm working, I mean, it's not true anymore now.

11:51.627 --> 11:56.654
It's sort of like people are paying attention to me.

11:56.694 --> 11:58.957
But even a few years ago, people were not.

11:59.138 --> 11:59.398
And

12:00.138 --> 12:07.046
You know, when I was writing Jurassic Park, a lot of people were very free to say to me, why are you doing that?

12:07.106 --> 12:08.648
No one can make the movie.

12:09.469 --> 12:10.951
You know, it's hopelessly expensive.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.514
It's got to be more than $100 million, and who's going to do it?

12:13.895 --> 12:16.878
And anyway, there's no way to make those dinosaurs.

12:16.938 --> 12:20.943
You know, they're never going to be any better than one million years B.C., and it's a piece of junk.

12:20.963 --> 12:22.065
So forget it.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.106
Why are you doing this book?

12:23.306 --> 12:27.411
And when I did Rising Sun, it was at the time of...

12:28.353 --> 12:34.960
you know, the fall of the Berlin Wall and all the interesting changes in Europe and the collapse of the former Soviet Union.

12:35.961 --> 12:38.604
I would be at these places and there would be this discussion.

12:38.644 --> 12:40.086
People would say, what are you working on?

12:40.146 --> 12:41.267
I'd say, Japan.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.428
Japan.

12:43.670 --> 12:48.115
As if I had said, you know, 10th century Sanskrit manuscripts.

12:51.178 --> 12:56.884
So, this stuff all fills me with anxiety when I'm working.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.465
I just think,

12:57.952 --> 13:00.795
I'm doing this, and who will care?

13:00.855 --> 13:03.758
Because I just come from dinner, and they all go, Japan!

13:04.659 --> 13:06.661
And I think it's interesting.

13:08.623 --> 13:10.526
So it's always a pleasant surprise.

13:11.767 --> 13:26.743
On your interview with The Morning America, I guess it was on this morning, you had mentioned that one of the primary reasons you wrote People to Jurassic Park was that kids wanted it, and you got letters from kids.

13:27.078 --> 13:29.101
Was the presence of R.B.

13:29.121 --> 13:39.216
and Kelly in The Lost World an attempt to have characters that kids could identify with, like, you had two children characters in Jurassic Park?

13:45.766 --> 13:55.701
No, I think it was... My feeling was that if you're doing a sequel, you have to kind of pick those things which...

13:56.508 --> 14:06.878
those elements in the original story which need to be reproduced, repeated, reiterated, referred to.

14:06.938 --> 14:10.061
You have to do something.

14:10.081 --> 14:18.109
And because there were these kids in the first one, I thought there had to be some way of addressing the idea that there would be kids in the second one.

14:18.129 --> 14:20.211
I just thought it was an element that had to be repeated.

14:20.231 --> 14:22.854
It was a necessity.

14:23.294 --> 14:26.177
I didn't particularly want them.

14:26.849 --> 14:34.136
Considering that Jurassic Park was your most successful book and the highest grossing film of all time, how did public pressure affect your decision to write a sequel?

14:35.657 --> 14:36.999
It really didn't.

14:38.901 --> 14:40.602
But, you know, here's the thing.

14:40.883 --> 14:45.967
You get all these letters from kids and they say, now, what about the sequel?

14:46.068 --> 14:47.089
And I get ideas.

14:48.370 --> 14:49.671
I think the sequel should be this.

14:49.751 --> 14:51.553
How about this as a sequel?

14:51.893 --> 14:53.835
And this goes on for about five years.

14:54.203 --> 14:57.368
And you're always writing back saying, no, we're not doing a sequel.

14:57.408 --> 14:58.730
No, there isn't going to be a sequel.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.591
No, I talked to Stephen.

14:59.631 --> 15:00.833
I'm sorry, there won't be a sequel.

15:01.414 --> 15:06.762
But each letter that comes in kind of brings the subject up again.

15:07.663 --> 15:11.169
And sometimes you'll read an idea and you think, no, that's not a good idea.

15:11.229 --> 15:12.371
And then you think, well, why not?

15:13.092 --> 15:15.475
If that's not the way the sequel should be, how should it be?

15:15.896 --> 15:18.240
So you have five years of thinking how the sequel should be.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.904
Pretty soon you almost have to do it.

15:20.924 --> 15:22.506
You've been thinking about it so long.

15:22.688 --> 15:28.357
Well, in Jurassic Park, at the end of the book, you had, you kind of left it open for a sequel.

15:28.778 --> 15:30.580
You had, like, the raptors come off the island.

15:31.903 --> 15:34.427
Did you have any, you had no intentions of writing a sequel?

15:34.887 --> 15:35.889
No, not.

15:36.169 --> 15:46.706
It's like, you know, in the film, for example, there's a shot when the spitter gets Nedry, and there's a shot of the can going into the mud.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.911
Now, everybody I know...

15:50.954 --> 15:53.417
has looked at that and said, that's setting up the sequel.

15:54.379 --> 15:59.306
But I know, I've actually never talked to Stephen about it, but I know perfectly well it's not.

15:59.686 --> 16:00.568
It's a cutaway.

16:00.808 --> 16:02.050
It's an essential shot.

16:02.631 --> 16:06.676
You've got Nedry in the spitter and the spitter's outside the car.

16:06.736 --> 16:09.480
The next time Nedry's going to get in the car and the spitter's inside.

16:09.520 --> 16:15.549
So you need to go to something in order to allow this change of geography to occur.

16:16.170 --> 16:20.556
And it has to be sort of interesting enough that you don't really pay attention to how much time has passed

16:21.430 --> 16:25.536
And that's all Stephen had to cut to, was the can rolling down the hill.

16:26.197 --> 16:27.700
That's all there was in the scene.

16:28.321 --> 16:33.809
So other than that, he would have to break the scene to go back to the control room, so he didn't want to do that.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.051
I think that's the correct decision.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.057
But that means he has to emphasize this can.

16:39.077 --> 16:41.281
So it's all about getting the spitter into the car.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.484
It's not about the sequel.

16:43.504 --> 16:48.412
Were you concerned that writing the sequel would diminish the originality of Jurassic Park?

16:48.432 --> 16:49.834
No, it never crossed my mind.

16:50.354 --> 16:50.915
What do you think?

16:50.995 --> 16:51.736
Is that a problem?

16:52.576 --> 16:57.462
No, but there's a certain stigma attached around the sequel that most authors have to do with.

16:57.482 --> 17:10.276
You know, because I live in this town where everyone does sequels all the time, and I never had, at a certain point I got kind of interested in it.

17:11.157 --> 17:12.559
I mean, I was interested to do it.

17:12.719 --> 17:14.421
Is it a hard decision to make a sequel?

17:18.299 --> 17:20.521
Well, it was hard to do.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.844
I don't know if the decision was hard.

17:22.864 --> 17:26.848
I mean, the book was harder than the decision.

17:29.771 --> 17:34.276
As a writer, you're subject to media criticism, which can both complement your work and also tear it apart.

17:34.937 --> 17:42.265
What's your response to Newsweek's description of The Lost World as an unfortunate rehash of its predecessor?

17:44.101 --> 17:56.804
If the cameras weren't on, I would tell you... Well, I guess I can tell you because they can never use this, but Tommy Lasorda is famous for saying that opinions are like assholes.

17:56.884 --> 17:57.746
Everybody has one.

17:59.749 --> 18:06.902
The better answer is, you know, I would expect a lot of...

18:09.599 --> 18:15.984
It seems to me that in recent years I've had a tremendous amount of criticism, and there was a tremendous amount of criticism for Jurassic Park.

18:16.885 --> 18:18.466
So why should this be any different?

18:18.487 --> 18:26.153
There's a lot of criticism for disclosure, and I'm accustomed to it.

18:26.173 --> 18:32.859
Do these kind of reviews impact what you're going to do in the future?

18:32.899 --> 18:32.959
No.

18:33.039 --> 18:34.460
Well, not quite.

18:36.902 --> 18:39.184
When I did Rising Sun, there was so much

18:41.138 --> 19:10.504
antagonism that was bordering on suggesting that I was racist you know which is a very unpleasant kind of criticism and from my point of view very unexpected that when I then thought of doing Disclosure which would be I knew perceived as critical of certain feminist ideas and

19:10.822 --> 19:15.328
To even enter that arena, I think, is to just be asking for trouble.

19:16.649 --> 19:21.836
I hesitated to do the book, because I thought there would be so much flack.

19:22.937 --> 19:25.701
I just thought, I don't know if I can stand it.

19:25.721 --> 19:28.685
But I did.

19:28.705 --> 19:31.488
You've discussed the success of Jurassic Park as a movie.

19:31.508 --> 19:34.292
Has a movie deal yet been made for The Lost Worlds?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.535
Yes.

19:36.555 --> 19:37.596
Can you give us the specifics?

19:37.616 --> 19:38.297
Is Steven Spielberg a bit better?

19:40.015 --> 19:43.320
Well, he's preparing the film now.

19:46.224 --> 19:49.669
You never know with Stephen what will happen.

19:52.994 --> 19:57.521
But there are very large forces at work to have a sequel.

19:57.701 --> 20:02.929
I mean, Universal really insists on it.

20:03.810 --> 20:05.733
Universal's position is there will be a sequel.

20:07.996 --> 20:08.757
So I would

20:09.277 --> 20:11.200
my expectation is Stephen will direct it.

20:11.281 --> 20:16.029
He's announced it for the summer of 97, which means he'll start shooting next summer.

20:17.251 --> 20:28.311
Every time you write a new piece, do you feel like you're under a microscope due to your past successes that this new piece should be successful?

20:28.331 --> 20:33.580
There was a famous Japanese potter who

20:33.982 --> 20:35.444
was asked how he worked.

20:35.484 --> 20:41.533
He was very revered in Japan and was a living treasure and so on.

20:41.553 --> 20:51.448
And he said, before I throw a pot, he said, I first have to put aside all my concerns about the clay and whether the clay is satisfactory.

20:51.468 --> 20:56.255
And then I have to put aside all my concerns about myself, whether my health or how I'm feeling today.

20:56.775 --> 20:59.179
And then I have to put aside all my concerns about

20:59.429 --> 21:03.973
how I will actually throw the clay and whether I'll do it well.

21:04.514 --> 21:12.241
And then I have to put aside all my concerns about when I finish the pot whether it will survive in the kiln or whether it will crack.

21:12.321 --> 21:18.126
And then I have to put aside all my concerns about after the pot is completed whether people will like it.

21:19.908 --> 21:21.149
And he had about eight of those things.

21:21.169 --> 21:24.752
He said, I have to put aside all those concerns and then I go and throw the pot.

21:25.433 --> 21:28.035
And I think that's part of my job.

21:29.045 --> 21:33.652
is not to be aware that anybody's watching.

21:36.376 --> 21:42.465
When reading The Lost World, it's tempting to get visual images of how certain characters or plots will play out.

21:43.026 --> 21:51.178
When you wrote the novel, did you have in mind people that you wanted to play, maybe in a movie, play the part?

21:51.418 --> 21:55.344
I really didn't, although I see it in my mind when I write.

21:55.504 --> 21:56.706
I've always seen it.

21:58.559 --> 22:03.186
I mean, long before any of these things were made into movies, people said, these books read just like a movie.

22:03.226 --> 22:08.635
Well, I don't know what... I see pictures and I just write them down.

22:08.655 --> 22:10.678
That's what I've always done.

22:10.698 --> 22:13.222
Have you written a script for the movie, or do you plan on writing scripts?

22:13.242 --> 22:17.990
No, I won't be writing a script.

22:18.010 --> 22:25.562
More than just a sci-fi thriller, Jurassic Park gave a warning to scientists that they should concentrate not only on

22:26.065 --> 22:34.856
if they could do certain things, but also the implications, and it focused on chaos, and it was just, it had certain themes to it.

22:35.277 --> 22:37.019
Were there any different themes in mind when writing?

22:39.782 --> 22:40.824
Yeah.

22:40.844 --> 22:47.372
I think my interest here is really in evolution, which is a much more difficult thing to talk about.

22:47.392 --> 22:53.119
It's actually very easy to talk about,

22:53.453 --> 22:54.254
technology.

22:54.835 --> 22:56.117
Technology is fun.

22:56.137 --> 22:57.119
It's the stuff.

22:57.559 --> 22:59.182
It's all around us.

22:59.242 --> 23:13.264
When you start talking about abstract ideas like evolution, and particularly if you start talking about chaotic ideas as they relate to evolution, then you're starting to work at a very detached level.

23:13.284 --> 23:15.447
It's hard to fit it into a popular book.

23:16.769 --> 23:19.073
What developments have you seen in your writing through the years?

23:24.132 --> 23:25.734
Well, it certainly gets harder to do.

23:25.754 --> 23:29.239
It takes longer.

23:36.709 --> 23:37.830
I don't know how to answer that.

23:37.870 --> 23:47.764
You know, I can tell you one thing, which is... Wow.

23:49.726 --> 23:52.049
It's the sync pod from hell.

23:52.370 --> 23:52.570
Yeah.

23:56.937 --> 24:26.556
I try very hard not to think about things like that because well because the minute you say this is the way I am or these are the way the changes are going or this is what's happening then that becomes some clothing that you've put on and then it begins to I can't move because of the mics but it begins to tug you know or it begins to hold you in place and you begin to think

24:28.156 --> 24:32.961
I shouldn't go into this area because I don't do that or I can't do that.

24:34.002 --> 24:43.311
And I tried to not make those definitions and instead just to do whatever interests me.

24:46.034 --> 24:51.479
When adapting for a movie script, it's almost inevitable that the book is going to get changed invariably.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.965
How do you feel about the degree to which some of your novels have been changed for the motion picture screen?

24:58.143 --> 24:59.644
Depends on the book, I think.

24:59.745 --> 25:00.786
I feel different ways.

25:00.846 --> 25:06.952
I've been quite happy with some of them, and I've been sick to my stomach with some of them.

25:08.754 --> 25:10.876
Which ones?

25:10.896 --> 25:11.837
Which ones didn't I like?

25:12.297 --> 25:15.380
Which ones didn't I like either?

25:15.400 --> 25:16.681
Well, I've actually liked most of them.

25:16.701 --> 25:18.303
I was very pleased with Disclosure.

25:18.323 --> 25:19.945
I was very pleased with Jurassic Park.

25:20.986 --> 25:22.707
I was quite unhappy with Rising Sun.

25:22.748 --> 25:24.609
I was quite unhappy with The Terminal Man.

25:24.770 --> 25:27.272
Those are the two that I really...

25:27.573 --> 25:27.954
Didn't lie.

25:27.974 --> 25:29.976
How did you feel about Congo?

25:31.078 --> 25:33.982
I haven't seen it.

25:34.002 --> 25:36.346
Don't know what to say.

25:36.366 --> 25:39.010
You said you liked the way that Jurassic Park was adapted.

25:39.711 --> 25:42.314
Obviously, some of it had to be changed nonetheless.

25:43.416 --> 25:48.103
Do you agree with the review of the movie that stated that Michael Crichton envisioned something else?

25:48.343 --> 25:52.930
Crichton's cautionary tale has been transformed into a dance of threats, chills, and escapes?

25:54.552 --> 25:55.774
No, I don't agree with that.

25:57.256 --> 26:05.248
I think, you know, it's a movie.

26:05.288 --> 26:24.175
And in a way, I think my interest is to try and address in some way issues, but still to have a sort of popular...

26:24.610 --> 26:26.752
format that's fun to read.

26:26.912 --> 26:29.935
Do you think the movie accomplished what the book set out to do?

26:29.955 --> 26:38.062
Well, I think that I have certain limitations that aren't, say, the limitation of a book that Steve Gould is writing about evolution.

26:39.684 --> 26:43.627
He can do certain things that I can't because of the structure of that.

26:43.948 --> 26:46.850
I can do certain things that he can't.

26:47.111 --> 26:52.275
I can say things that he wouldn't dare to say because I don't have to make all those academic qualifications.

26:52.335 --> 26:54.077
I'm not a university.

26:54.479 --> 27:01.830
And Stephen making the movie has other kinds of opportunities and limitations as well.

27:01.850 --> 27:02.872
They're different forms.

27:04.835 --> 27:05.616
And I accept that.

27:06.778 --> 27:06.978
All right.

27:07.038 --> 27:09.462
Well, The Lost World will soon be attracting national attention.

27:09.842 --> 27:11.405
You've written many other notable novels.

27:11.966 --> 27:14.730
You started way back in Harvard with The Case of Need.

27:14.750 --> 27:18.115
Why was The Case of Need written under the name Jeffrey Hudson?

27:18.135 --> 27:21.440
Because I didn't want anybody to know I was writing books.

27:21.460 --> 27:22.782
You know...

27:23.538 --> 27:28.985
A lot of your grade as a medical student is personal assessment.

27:29.005 --> 27:45.006
And I was quite sure, I mean, I had to do this to pay my way, but I knew that if they found out that I was writing books that I would be in trouble because it just wasn't, you know, it didn't show proper spirit to be off writing books.

27:45.391 --> 27:51.622
particularly a book like that that had many members of the Harvard Medical School faculty in it, thinly disguised.

27:51.722 --> 28:09.795
And when it came out, we identified Jeffrey Hudson as a medical researcher living in London, which I thought was, you know, keep him far away so he can't be interviewed.

28:10.383 --> 28:16.251
But the book came out and people were reading it and saying, boy, whoever wrote this knows a lot about that medical school.

28:16.391 --> 28:17.292
And I would be right there.

28:17.573 --> 28:19.856
Yeah, who could it be?

28:19.876 --> 28:20.817
It was a real secret.

28:24.061 --> 28:25.223
How did you find time to write?

28:25.383 --> 28:27.706
Do it fast.

28:27.806 --> 28:36.778
Yeah, I mean, it was really, for me it was wonderful training because...

28:40.488 --> 28:44.273
Because it was sort of the reverse of every writer's thing.

28:44.293 --> 28:46.557
I had to get something done very fast.

28:47.618 --> 28:54.648
I would have a vacation, Christmas vacation two weeks, and then there's the January term bill.

28:55.790 --> 29:03.981
So I would have to sit down, write a paperback thriller in two weeks, send it at the end of December to New York,

29:04.315 --> 29:14.211
to Signet, which was my publisher, they would have to accept it and get the check back to me by January 20th, or I wasn't going to make the term bill.

29:14.231 --> 29:16.715
So there was no fooling around.

29:17.616 --> 29:19.339
It didn't matter if I was not in the mood.

29:19.439 --> 29:21.262
I had to be in the mood, or I'd be out on the street.

29:21.422 --> 29:28.433
And it didn't... It wasn't an issue about having it be...

29:29.223 --> 29:31.407
creative or wonderful or anything like that.

29:31.427 --> 29:32.789
It couldn't be too creative.

29:32.809 --> 29:42.365
It had to really fit a pre-existing mold, because they had to accept it right away, and they had to pay me right away.

29:44.008 --> 29:50.158
So I was really trying to imitate that sort of spy format, and it was wonderful.

29:50.518 --> 29:51.640
It was great training.

29:53.303 --> 29:55.787
I didn't want to be creative, and I didn't want to be known for it.

29:58.079 --> 30:06.068
Your novel Congo, which you wrote 15 years ago, has recently been adapted to a motion picture, undoubtedly due to the success of other movies based on your books.

30:06.529 --> 30:13.717
Do you think that due to this phenomenal success that other books such as Eaters of the Dead and The Case of Need will be made into movies?

30:14.118 --> 30:15.099
The Case of Need was made.

30:16.941 --> 30:21.526
1972 or something like that.

30:21.606 --> 30:22.828
Blake Edwards directed it.

30:22.848 --> 30:24.430
James Coburn and Jennifer O'Neill.

30:25.411 --> 30:26.432
Called The Carrie Treatment.

30:26.935 --> 30:28.697
So it won't be made.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.222
Eatersly Dead might be made.

30:34.242 --> 30:34.522
Might be.

30:35.222 --> 30:41.088
Might be.

30:41.108 --> 30:42.889
But you didn't become a doctor.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.412
You did have much educational experience.

30:45.812 --> 30:51.417
Do your real-life medical experiences, like inside patients, contribute to ER class?

30:52.678 --> 30:53.819
It certainly did originally.

30:56.101 --> 30:56.942
Yeah.

30:58.087 --> 31:14.643
You know, when ER began, in the early episodes, I had some complaints about the way some of the scenes were, and John Wells said to me, well, why don't you write?

31:14.803 --> 31:18.047
You know, you write the scene.

31:18.067 --> 31:20.889
And I said, no, no, no, I'm not going to write it.

31:20.909 --> 31:27.756
I'll tell you what has to happen, but I'm not going to write it, because I really can't.

31:28.394 --> 31:30.937
You know, that show is a full-time job.

31:31.697 --> 31:40.026
So I'm excited to supervise it and to be involved with it and to make a contribution to it, but I can't.

31:40.046 --> 31:41.307
1,500 pages of script a year.

31:43.429 --> 31:44.751
A lot.

31:44.791 --> 31:47.293
You wrote the script for ER 22 years ago, I believe.

31:47.313 --> 31:47.814
20.

31:47.834 --> 31:50.297
20 years ago, originally intended to be a movie.

31:50.417 --> 31:51.458
Right.

31:51.498 --> 31:54.621
What made you change your mind and decide that it would be better off as a TV show?

31:57.301 --> 31:59.124
Well, you know, it had this long history.

31:59.184 --> 32:05.593
It was actually going to be a film.

32:05.634 --> 32:12.444
It was cast, and I was going to direct it, and then the studio got Cold Feet, and it was then followed by 20 years of Cold Feet.

32:13.866 --> 32:22.960
And all that really happened was that Stephen got it, and it had sat with his company for about five years.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.924
Nobody was really doing anything with it.

32:26.562 --> 32:34.672
And the appeal to me of doing it for television was that we thought we could get the network to make it as is.

32:36.314 --> 32:46.887
You know, and it wasn't going to... There was a lot of apprehension about it because it was so fast-paced and because it was about doctors and all the things that are now seen as virtues.

32:47.988 --> 32:53.835
But all that really happened was that NBC decided to take a chance.

32:54.878 --> 32:57.863
and make the script.

32:57.883 --> 33:07.358
One of the things that people like about your novels is that they all seem very well researched, and you seem to become an expert on every single thing before you write the book about it.

33:07.919 --> 33:12.626
If you were planning to, I mean, are you doing research like African-American now?

33:12.646 --> 33:12.787
Mm-hmm.

33:12.807 --> 33:15.871
What do you work with?

33:15.892 --> 33:20.599
I can't really tell you, but...

33:24.612 --> 33:29.359
Well, I'm reading John Stuart Mill, Raymond Chandler, and James M. King.

33:30.260 --> 33:33.645
So if you can make an intersection out of that, you'll know where I'm going.

33:34.726 --> 33:41.376
How did your research for Jurassic Park compare to the research you did for Rising Sun?

33:41.496 --> 33:48.906
Rising Sun was a very... Jurassic Park is a construction, you know.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.248
I mean, Jurassic Park is...

33:51.697 --> 34:04.690
The goal in Jurassic Park is to persuade you that you should believe in dinosaurs for the time that you read the book, which to me was a very hard goal because we all know they're not there.

34:04.710 --> 34:12.658
So on the one hand, it's fun to pretend, but on the other hand, there's a huge block.

34:12.958 --> 34:18.203
I mean, it's much easier for me to write a story about a virus coming out of central Zaire.

34:18.964 --> 34:20.185
Everyone's ready to believe that.

34:21.565 --> 34:25.470
they're not ready to believe dinosaurs coming out of Central Zaire.

34:27.472 --> 34:42.451
So that was the whole effort in that book, was to try and find information or uses of technology that could convince people, and also to structure a plot so that you would buy into it.

34:42.511 --> 34:47.657
Rising Sun's a whole different matter, because Rising Sun was addressing a pre-existing and rather long-standing

34:49.021 --> 34:53.787
academic and intellectual debate about posture toward Japan.

34:55.209 --> 34:59.975
How did you go about doing your research for Rising Sun?

35:00.055 --> 35:01.957
Well, there's two things.

35:01.998 --> 35:09.347
There's a fair amount of conferences and meetings and things that you can go to.

35:10.508 --> 35:13.793
A lot of them are arranged by the Japan societies and so on.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.156
So I went to those.

35:17.257 --> 35:18.859
And then there's a

35:19.328 --> 35:23.434
a fairly well-defined body of literature with people lined up on both sides.

35:24.115 --> 35:32.288
You just read that, and then you know the debate and the arguments on both sides.

35:32.308 --> 35:41.963
In the article about you in Time magazine, it says that once you start to write a novel, you work seven days a week, nonstop, to write that novel.

35:42.404 --> 35:45.268
Do you find yourself happiest while you're writing on it?

35:47.138 --> 35:49.582
I don't think there's any question I'm happy as not.

35:53.208 --> 35:56.312
I don't like to do it.

35:56.332 --> 35:58.115
It's work.

35:58.296 --> 36:01.781
The most difficult thing is it pulls you out of the world.

36:06.048 --> 36:07.851
Lost World took a long time at one point.

36:07.911 --> 36:09.433
I have a daughter who's six.

36:11.152 --> 36:20.687
And I get kind of distracted, you know, when I'm working, and I sort of sit at the dinner table, but I don't really ever say anything, and I'm, you know, you ask me a question, and I don't answer for a long time.

36:21.788 --> 36:30.582
My wife and my daughter were talking, and my daughter turned to me and started to ask me a question, and looked at me, and then just turned away, because she knew I wouldn't answer.

36:30.662 --> 36:35.609
And then she looked back and she said, Dad, when are you going to be finished with that book?

36:35.629 --> 36:37.412
And I went, I don't know.

36:38.152 --> 36:42.478
In this issue of Time magazine, there's an article about you called How Good Is Your Science?

36:42.879 --> 36:44.581
How good is your science and the novels you write?

36:45.542 --> 36:46.904
I really liked that article.

36:46.964 --> 36:47.945
It said it was quite good.

36:47.966 --> 36:51.010
I appreciate that.

36:51.751 --> 36:56.778
I'm very aware that I have to make compromises.

36:57.999 --> 37:01.284
Particularly in discussions of evolution.

37:01.384 --> 37:07.973
It's a very complicated area.

37:08.712 --> 37:12.996
You know, and you can write a whole book on that, and I can't.

37:13.076 --> 37:18.501
You know, I can do two paragraphs here or two pages there and hope to try and make enough.

37:18.621 --> 37:22.384
I mean, my real goal is to stimulate people to go read something else.

37:22.664 --> 37:25.907
Do you believe in a lost world like the one you wrote about?

37:25.927 --> 37:26.908
Absolutely not.

37:28.209 --> 37:34.414
How did you get your idea for Jurassic Park?

37:34.434 --> 37:37.337
It came around, you know, it came, it has this long history.

37:37.437 --> 37:38.618
Originally I did a

37:39.205 --> 37:52.421
an original screenplay about a graduate student who made a pterodactyl by obtaining the DNA from a fossil.

37:53.121 --> 37:54.743
And it was kind of a fantasy.

37:54.963 --> 37:59.749
The kid makes this pterodactyl, the pterodactyl gets very big and eats things, and it was one of those stories.

38:01.391 --> 38:03.493
And it didn't work.

38:03.694 --> 38:07.678
It had a lot of logical problems and difficulties in it.

38:08.940 --> 38:09.060
And

38:09.293 --> 38:12.496
I didn't really believe the scientific underpinning.

38:13.317 --> 38:14.158
So I put it aside.

38:14.238 --> 38:15.199
It was one of those things.

38:15.219 --> 38:16.080
I didn't know what to do with it.

38:16.160 --> 38:21.827
And as the years went by, they began to get DNA out of fossils.

38:23.588 --> 38:27.733
And then there was this other interest in extracting DNA from insects and amber.

38:30.296 --> 38:35.141
And all these techniques were improving at a tremendously fast rate.

38:35.161 --> 38:38.845
So that by the late 80s, it wasn't quite so fantastical.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.899
And I began to take it seriously, that's all.

38:42.919 --> 38:50.949
You mentioned that in letters to you from people, a lot of suggestions were given for how a sequel might happen to Jurassic Park.

38:51.470 --> 38:54.713
To what degree did you use those for the actual idea of her?

38:54.733 --> 38:55.194
Not at all.

38:56.476 --> 38:57.196
No.

38:58.758 --> 38:59.399
I don't know why.

38:59.419 --> 39:08.410
The first thing that happens is that people either make sort of point suggestions, like,

39:09.065 --> 39:10.467
here would be a good dinosaur.

39:11.488 --> 39:14.152
And you say, well, what good is that to me?

39:18.057 --> 39:23.064
You don't know why this young reader has thought this is a good dinosaur.

39:23.104 --> 39:24.666
They just think this is a good dinosaur.

39:26.669 --> 39:28.011
So that isn't very helpful.

39:28.051 --> 39:36.102
And then the other thing is that most people made the assumption that, of course, you would go back to the island of Jurassic Park.

39:37.111 --> 39:40.977
And my instinct, which is only, it's just an instinct, is you don't do that.

39:41.858 --> 39:43.240
Don't go back to that same place.

39:44.462 --> 39:50.992
So that 99% of all those ideas are useless because I'm not going to do that part.

39:52.253 --> 40:02.008
But it's that interesting quality of being asked about something that you don't intend to do for years and years and years, and pretty soon you start to think about it.

40:04.291 --> 40:04.772
It's funny.

40:05.950 --> 40:07.833
Do you visit the sets of your movies?

40:07.853 --> 40:08.494
Very rarely.

40:09.475 --> 40:10.096
Try not to.

40:12.520 --> 40:16.827
It's not... It's not my set.

40:17.888 --> 40:21.754
You know, if I'm directing, then it's my set, and I want to know what the hell these other people are doing on it.

40:22.515 --> 40:34.253
And there's another reason, which is that, you know, if I'm the author of the book or of the screenplay, then I become another authority.

40:35.397 --> 40:38.201
And I think the director rightly wants to be the only authority.

40:38.241 --> 40:43.930
So I make a social visit usually and then stay away.

40:44.330 --> 40:52.702
The other reason is when I was directing, I used to ask people why would they come to the set?

40:52.923 --> 40:54.124
Why would they see the dailies?

40:54.886 --> 40:57.610
Because I don't usually look at dailies either.

40:58.912 --> 40:59.953
Why do they do all that?

41:00.642 --> 41:13.516
Because the real question you have about dailies is, will an outside person watching the dailies catch something that the actual production team that's making the movie didn't catch?

41:15.218 --> 41:18.721
And something that has to be fixed now, can't be fixed later.

41:18.882 --> 41:19.522
Can't go back.

41:22.105 --> 41:25.529
And in my experience, that never happened.

41:25.549 --> 41:29.653
I mean, I did have some terrible, terrible problems...

41:30.410 --> 41:33.273
shooting movies, but no one caught it.

41:33.393 --> 41:41.041
The studio didn't catch it, my people didn't catch it, but we were putting the picture together and the editor said to me, where's the shot of the guy coming through the door?

41:42.503 --> 41:44.125
And I said, oh, we shot it in Boston.

41:44.145 --> 41:44.886
He said, no, you didn't.

41:46.407 --> 41:49.991
I said, well, you don't need it anyway because you can stand to the door and just have it on her face.

41:50.011 --> 41:52.434
He said, no, she's not there yet.

41:52.574 --> 41:54.236
You don't have her, it doesn't match.

41:54.496 --> 41:58.240
And you start, oh, oh.

41:58.928 --> 42:03.374
And, you know, so my experience is, why is the studio watching the dailies?

42:03.414 --> 42:05.417
Because they're not catching these mistakes.

42:05.778 --> 42:11.346
So I don't watch Barry Levinson's dailies or Steven Spielberg's dailies.

42:11.987 --> 42:12.367
I'm not.

42:13.068 --> 42:14.851
Why?

42:14.871 --> 42:18.436
We have to have maybe one last question so we can get to the next program.

42:18.456 --> 42:20.239
I think there's... Where did you live?

42:20.960 --> 42:23.484
49 Barbary Way.

42:23.504 --> 42:24.405
Where is that?

42:24.425 --> 42:27.549
It's in... We're all dying to know.

42:27.630 --> 42:27.990
Yeah.

42:28.274 --> 42:29.736
Barbary Lane.

42:30.958 --> 42:32.159
What is this road that goes out?

42:32.880 --> 42:35.644
Roslyn Road.

42:35.864 --> 42:36.465
Roslyn Road.

42:36.746 --> 42:38.848
Okay, and then is it the East Hill School?

42:39.990 --> 42:41.051
The elementary school?

42:41.172 --> 42:45.818
Okay, we go past the elementary school and turn left in that.

42:45.838 --> 42:46.599
What's that in there?

42:47.280 --> 42:48.842
And there's a road called Barbary Lane.

42:49.363 --> 42:49.924
I was at 49.

42:50.064 --> 42:51.406
Did you just get your half?

42:51.426 --> 42:53.168
I was just there, yeah.

42:53.688 --> 42:55.190
And the lady was very nice.

42:55.210 --> 42:57.833
She took me through it.

42:57.853 --> 43:01.678
Showed me my room, and it was great.

43:01.798 --> 43:15.876
Okay, we want to thank you, because this was a great opportunity.

43:16.116 --> 43:20.522
Yeah.

43:21.481 --> 43:23.907
You guys should take pictures.

43:23.947 --> 43:26.873
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

43:26.934 --> 43:28.557
Let's forget this.

43:28.838 --> 43:30.281
Did you get all that you need?

43:31.224 --> 43:31.564
Yeah?

43:31.865 --> 43:32.948
Probably.

43:34.571 --> 43:38.781
Is there anything that...

43:39.470 --> 43:42.374
The school looks very different than when you went here.

43:43.014 --> 43:43.896
Did you notice that?

43:44.697 --> 43:47.600
You know, what's different is that addition in the front.

43:48.101 --> 43:48.301
Right.

43:48.321 --> 43:51.285
Because there used to be that big hill going down.

43:51.785 --> 43:55.009
But this back entrance here looks pretty much the same.

43:56.651 --> 43:57.452
It's funny, you know.

43:57.472 --> 43:59.435
I mean, wait until you get to be my age.

43:59.495 --> 44:03.320
I mean, it's a... It's sort of everything's the same but different.

44:04.141 --> 44:06.203
It's all kind of the same and all kind of not.

44:07.144 --> 44:07.665
It's funny.

44:07.685 --> 44:09.207
Did your parents move out of the community?

44:09.794 --> 44:14.961
When did you come from Chicago?

44:15.522 --> 44:16.463
When did I come here?

44:16.483 --> 44:22.351
No, I was born there, but I didn't.

44:23.613 --> 44:25.215
I came here in 48.

44:25.235 --> 44:31.123
I was here from 48 to 60.

44:31.723 --> 44:34.367
Have you seen any of the teachers that have come back today?

44:34.702 --> 44:36.344
No, I haven't.

44:36.604 --> 44:39.107
I know they're here, I know, yeah.

44:39.127 --> 44:39.928
It's very exciting.

44:40.789 --> 44:40.929
Huh?

44:40.950 --> 44:42.131
You never see any of them?

44:42.812 --> 44:49.420
Yeah, you know, I was thinking, what do you call, you know, because I used to be Mr. Brule, and then what do I do now?

44:49.460 --> 44:54.125
I mean, I'm 50 and they're 75 or whatever it is.

44:54.145 --> 44:56.288
Are we going to finally shift it?

44:56.308 --> 44:59.372
I'm sure I'll call them Mr. Do you still play basketball?

44:59.672 --> 45:03.797
No, no, I'm too old and creaky, no.

45:04.182 --> 45:04.783
Can't do that.

45:05.324 --> 45:18.742
So you wouldn't want to play the team that's waiting for you right now?

45:18.902 --> 45:19.102
No.

45:19.363 --> 45:20.584
No, I'll not.

45:20.644 --> 45:20.745
No.

45:20.765 --> 45:21.225
Okay.

45:21.526 --> 45:25.050
Why don't we get another camera crew?

45:25.611 --> 45:27.654
Can I have a picture of one?

45:27.734 --> 45:29.937
Of course, sure.

45:29.957 --> 45:32.661
No, that's fine.

45:32.681 --> 45:33.482
Did you call me your name again?

45:33.502 --> 45:33.582
Yes.

45:34.321 --> 45:49.122
It's not so much that you ask a great question, but you look so good.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.946
Eric, look at Eric.

45:51.966 --> 45:54.830
I'm very impressed with Eric.

45:54.890 --> 45:55.891
He's very dressed today.

45:56.051 --> 45:57.573
Thank you very much.

45:57.994 --> 45:59.616
Is that all right?

45:59.716 --> 46:00.818
Are they all clean up?

46:02.063 --> 46:04.787
Kevin, K-E-Z-I-N.

46:04.807 --> 46:10.737
Not a problem.

46:11.177 --> 46:15.063
Just pull up in front.

46:15.324 --> 46:15.725
Frank.

46:15.865 --> 46:16.145
Frank.

46:16.205 --> 46:18.088
Frank.

46:18.168 --> 46:26.822
Frank.

46:27.781 --> 46:37.512
I'm going to end up saying exactly the same thing for all of you guys here, sir.

46:37.532 --> 46:37.912
All right.

46:37.932 --> 46:39.214
All right.

46:39.234 --> 46:40.195
Is that with a C?

46:40.615 --> 46:41.316
Yeah.

46:41.336 --> 46:42.177
You look high.

46:43.358 --> 46:54.431
There you go.

46:54.871 --> 46:54.991
Scott.

46:55.632 --> 46:56.573
I didn't even say it.

46:57.143 --> 46:58.104
Oh, that's mine.

46:58.505 --> 46:59.826
You don't need to.

47:00.046 --> 47:00.787
It's automatic.

47:01.007 --> 47:03.510
You press the button on the front and front of L-R.

47:03.790 --> 47:04.031
Yeah.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.553
Yeah, I wrote the same thing.

47:06.573 --> 47:23.112
You know, when Steve Martin did a book called Cruel Shoes when he was making movies, and he gave a copy to everybody on the crew, and each one he said, to whoever it was, you're the best guy on the crew.

47:23.372 --> 47:23.472
Okay.

47:23.823 --> 47:31.043
It's spelled kind of funny.

47:31.083 --> 47:35.837
Kevin McKay-V-A-N.

47:35.877 --> 47:38.845
We have it set up around.

47:39.871 --> 47:40.452
No.

47:40.472 --> 47:42.175
Can you take a picture?

47:42.195 --> 47:44.138
Do you take a picture?

47:44.298 --> 47:44.859
Yes, I will.

47:44.959 --> 47:49.406
She's had a good picture for the weekend.

47:49.466 --> 47:51.329
Wait a minute.

47:51.349 --> 47:54.534
One, two, three.

47:56.918 --> 47:57.479
First button.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.702
All right.

48:01.471 --> 48:03.433
technology is not my thing.

48:03.493 --> 48:04.314
I understand.

48:04.414 --> 48:05.475
Do you think of that?

48:05.495 --> 48:06.076
That's Scott.

48:06.116 --> 48:06.476
This one?

48:06.496 --> 48:06.677
Yes.

48:07.498 --> 48:08.218
Two tears?

48:08.619 --> 48:08.979
Yeah.

48:09.019 --> 48:11.001
You know what we're throwing to that one?

48:11.021 --> 48:12.583
You just took your fingers on the flash.

48:12.623 --> 48:13.985
It's not going to come out after you don't mind.

48:14.005 --> 48:14.645
Was it really?

48:14.665 --> 48:14.966
Yeah.

48:15.226 --> 48:17.268
This will come out.

48:17.769 --> 48:19.351
That's not the one.

48:19.411 --> 48:21.253
Could you redo the other one?

48:21.273 --> 48:21.833
Yeah.

48:21.933 --> 48:22.494
One more.

48:22.514 --> 48:23.015
One more.

48:24.096 --> 48:25.057
Where's the flash?

48:25.137 --> 48:25.497
Oh, here.

48:25.878 --> 48:26.498
Yeah.

48:26.518 --> 48:27.259
Okay.

48:27.299 --> 48:28.240
You have to hold it.

48:28.380 --> 48:28.641
Hello.

48:28.721 --> 48:30.803
Hello.

48:31.171 --> 48:42.345
Yeah, you guys did a great job.

48:43.867 --> 48:57.904
Yeah, you know, you had all these, uh,

48:58.593 --> 49:06.184
Working journalists like Nick here, who does a lot of writing, I think you guys, yeah.

49:06.224 --> 49:10.210
We managed to find you copies of one of the papers you were on.

49:10.470 --> 49:10.931
Is that right?

49:10.951 --> 49:13.194
They spelled your name three different ways.

49:13.214 --> 49:14.175
Yeah, sure.

49:14.195 --> 49:17.680
We've gotten much better since about that.

49:18.141 --> 49:18.702
Sure.

49:18.722 --> 49:20.865
Yeah, since about that.

49:21.546 --> 49:22.367
Wow, let's see.

49:22.467 --> 49:23.689
I'm in the side of the line.

49:24.023 --> 49:25.285
Hey, future's editor.

49:25.425 --> 49:26.687
That's the promising future editor.

49:26.707 --> 49:27.348
Future's editor?

49:27.568 --> 49:28.249
That's what I am.

49:28.669 --> 49:30.191
That's right.

49:30.211 --> 49:32.094
Oh, you pulled out an old... Yeah.

49:32.114 --> 49:32.915
Oh, my God.

49:33.556 --> 49:34.678
Did she use your book?

49:35.098 --> 49:35.258
Yeah.

49:35.298 --> 49:35.479
No.

49:35.719 --> 49:36.240
Yeah.

49:36.260 --> 49:38.102
You haven't talked about it.

49:38.122 --> 49:41.387
I was thrown off The Honest Society.

49:41.667 --> 49:42.128
Why?

49:42.188 --> 49:42.468
Why?

49:42.649 --> 49:43.450
I won't.

49:43.470 --> 49:44.611
You know that?

49:44.631 --> 49:46.574
No, I didn't know that.

49:46.654 --> 49:49.558
I use ghostwriting papers.

49:49.994 --> 49:56.241
Like we didn't know that.

49:56.261 --> 50:00.486
Jesse, you only find that out after the interview.

50:00.546 --> 50:03.169
I'm a photography editor here.

50:03.650 --> 50:06.974
Hey.

50:07.154 --> 50:08.656
Oh, and this is the microphone.

50:08.676 --> 50:12.620
See, that was my column.

50:15.283 --> 50:16.605
The microphone.

50:16.625 --> 50:16.845
Oh, well.

50:19.357 --> 50:22.100
Yeah, see, it's definitely spelled.

50:22.181 --> 50:22.621
You're right.

50:22.741 --> 50:24.924
Well, you know, it's the old days.

50:24.984 --> 50:28.508
This is real tight in those days.

50:28.528 --> 50:48.233
Wow, that's great.

50:48.567 --> 50:51.573
What's GLB?

50:51.673 --> 50:52.875
I'm a fan, too.

50:53.977 --> 50:55.941
It's the government.

50:56.001 --> 50:57.184
The school government.

50:57.204 --> 50:58.847
If you saw how this word would be today.

50:59.187 --> 51:03.155
Yeah, you should see one of them.

51:03.856 --> 51:04.598
One of what?

51:04.898 --> 51:05.259
A blood.

51:05.279 --> 51:06.762
It's impossible.

51:10.454 --> 51:15.581
You're great.

51:16.021 --> 51:36.968
I love you.
