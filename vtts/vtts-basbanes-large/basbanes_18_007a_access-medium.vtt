00:02.782 --> 00:08.750
There really aren't that many novels written about the Armenian genocide, are there?

00:09.070 --> 00:10.112
It's not that I can think of.

00:11.474 --> 00:15.759
And it's quite a small American ethnic group, I guess.

00:15.819 --> 00:20.766
I'm of Greek descent myself, so we don't have a large, huge community.

00:21.687 --> 00:25.292
Tell me a little bit about how this novel came to be, I guess.

00:25.372 --> 00:26.514
Why don't we start generally?

00:29.718 --> 00:32.181
Well, let me just say first that...

00:33.123 --> 00:42.253
The book tells the story of the Armenian Genocide as witnessed by the grandmother.

00:42.433 --> 00:46.758
The book is about three generations in an Armenian family.

00:47.399 --> 00:58.551
I don't really see the book as about the Armenian Genocide so much as taking how the Armenian Genocide affected three generations in a family.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.473
Well, it is about it then, I think.

01:00.753 --> 01:01.594
Right, right.

01:02.030 --> 01:06.958
but I think there's a perception that the entire book covers the Armenian genocide.

01:06.998 --> 01:07.960
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:07.980 --> 01:08.521
Yes.

01:08.541 --> 01:09.642
I don't have that perception.

01:09.682 --> 01:10.824
Do you think there is a perception?

01:10.884 --> 01:20.961
I think that in some of the ways the book's been talked about, the genocide is what has been talked about.

01:21.001 --> 01:27.852
And for me as a writer, what interested me was here is this act.

01:28.608 --> 01:52.405
this historical act that has really gone unrecognized, and how does the fact of the genocide and also the fact that it's been unrecognized, how has that affected a particular family, three generations of this family, that so far have been unable to heal the wounds of the genocide?

01:53.380 --> 02:05.933
As a newspaper man, I can certainly, as one who spent many years as a journalist, I can certainly see, however, where there would be interest in that angle.

02:05.953 --> 02:07.214
Oh, sure, sure.

02:07.234 --> 02:11.419
You know, the fact that it is a lesser-known genocide.

02:11.699 --> 02:11.839
Right.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.321
And I'm glad for that.

02:13.681 --> 02:20.468
I'm glad that the genocide is being talked about.

02:20.887 --> 02:24.752
I mean, do you think that it perhaps has been ignored?

02:25.653 --> 02:26.535
Oh, absolutely.

02:26.615 --> 02:44.078
In part, because the Turks, to this day, refuse to acknowledge that the event ever happened, despite all the firsthand accounts and the extensive documentation in the Library of Congress and our National Archives and throughout the world.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.746
And circumstances have been such where, unlike the Germans, they have not had to

02:50.232 --> 02:53.978
be held accountable in any kind of world forum, I guess.

02:54.218 --> 02:54.479
That's right.

02:54.499 --> 03:00.088
Well, to paraphrase the women in the novel, for the Armenians, there was no Nuremberg.

03:00.108 --> 03:00.589
Exactly.

03:02.071 --> 03:11.246
And, of course, it speaks for any number of other unspeakable genocides of the century, doesn't it?

03:11.386 --> 03:11.847
That's right.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.670
The one that's going on right now, I guess.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.451
That's right.

03:15.173 --> 03:21.018
Tell me a little bit about yourself and, of course, this is your first novel.

03:21.238 --> 03:22.059
Right.

03:22.079 --> 03:32.208
So one can assume by your surname and also by the material that you write about that there is a lot of autobiographical material here.

03:32.448 --> 03:33.249
Yeah.

03:33.369 --> 03:34.010
Not really.

03:34.670 --> 03:38.133
Yes, I'm half Armenian.

03:38.153 --> 03:41.256
My father's Armenian, obviously.

03:42.637 --> 03:44.539
But as a writer, I feel...

03:44.924 --> 03:49.630
most free when the characters are fully invented.

03:49.971 --> 03:55.598
And this story and these characters are fully invented.

03:56.139 --> 03:57.881
They're not from my life.

03:58.101 --> 04:13.041
Where my life intersects the book is that certainly because of my background, the Armenian Genocide is of great interest.

04:13.645 --> 04:19.290
But also I think the book raises universal questions.

04:19.650 --> 04:32.402
The narrator's mission in the book, or quest, is that she is pregnant and is asking the question, what is she going to pass on to the next generation?

04:33.823 --> 04:43.332
And while the Armenian Genocide is extreme, every family has its ghosts.

04:43.987 --> 04:53.062
This family's ghosts happen to be, like I said, extreme.

04:53.362 --> 05:01.295
So to answer the autobiographical question, it's not really an autobiographical book.

05:01.375 --> 05:05.522
I know that that's assumed because it's in the first person and it's a

05:09.181 --> 05:11.665
And, of course, the obvious, I suppose.

05:12.366 --> 05:27.268
All right, so it's not autobiographical in a specific sense, but for the material, clearly had to come from, I mean, did you talk to relatives?

05:27.368 --> 05:30.152
I read a lot.

05:30.412 --> 05:31.434
I did a lot of research.

05:31.454 --> 05:34.378
Let me go back to your first question, where the book came from for me.

05:34.696 --> 05:37.380
It came from really two places.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.383
One when I was in 1979.

05:39.584 --> 06:01.598
I was a Senate page in Washington, and I had to write a research paper, and I chose to write the paper on the Armenian Genocide, particularly since I was down in Washington and could really explore the National Archives and all the information in the Library of Congress.

06:02.303 --> 06:10.976
And that was the first time in my life that I really understood or began to understand the scope of the genocide.

06:12.978 --> 06:20.269
And I wrote the paper and I went on with my life and didn't realize how much suicide affected me.

06:21.791 --> 06:30.724
And it was years later when I was 20 and was taking a junior year abroad that I had

06:34.012 --> 06:42.579
I actually had a dream one night in which this old woman came to me almost like a visitation.

06:43.020 --> 06:46.283
And, you know, as a writer, you'll take inspiration from anybody.

06:46.303 --> 06:46.483
Sure.

06:47.023 --> 06:52.168
And when I awoke, I began writing this old story.

06:52.188 --> 06:57.552
I thought it was a short story, but obviously it became a much larger project.

06:57.592 --> 06:59.094
But that woman was Cassard.

06:59.474 --> 07:02.837
So the book really began, for me, with Cassard.

07:06.682 --> 07:07.243
Okay.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.916
I'm just looking at some background material.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.703
So you're a Connecticut woman, I guess?

07:16.067 --> 07:16.167
Yeah.

07:16.187 --> 07:18.413
And I'm just...

07:19.692 --> 07:31.042
It's awfully hard to ask you about the novel itself because the novel does, I mean, we should take the novel on its own merits, of course, as you would wish, I'm sure.

07:31.062 --> 07:37.688
I have to say the interviews with novelists are the most difficult because you're trying to get the background.

07:38.569 --> 07:41.871
Can I say a couple other things?

07:41.891 --> 07:42.492
Please, go ahead.

07:45.435 --> 07:49.378
I know, you know, okay, we've talked about the genocide.

07:49.780 --> 08:03.454
Some of the questions that, or for me, what the book is about is that in every family, no matter how broken or wounded, people yearn to be understood.

08:05.036 --> 08:14.827
And in this particular family, Kassar, the grandmother, has survived this horrific event and refuses to talk about it.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.150
So there is never any healing in the family.

08:18.586 --> 08:23.591
that those wounds, the shame and the anger, gets passed on to her daughter and to her daughter.

08:25.553 --> 08:29.297
And it is set as a job to heal the family.

08:30.699 --> 08:47.597
And one of the things I think the book really goes into is sort of the forbidden territory, the unspoken bond between mothers and daughters, and those things that are taboo within families.

08:48.033 --> 08:48.894
sexuality.

08:51.557 --> 08:52.999
And I can talk about a scene in the book.

08:53.039 --> 08:56.222
I don't know how... Are you doing more of a profile on me?

08:56.383 --> 08:59.686
Yeah, well, it develops, okay?

08:59.826 --> 09:04.672
It's kind of... It's really a book-related feature type thing.

09:04.932 --> 09:10.959
And the profile material is important, but it will be absolutely related to the book.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.881
I mean, I wouldn't be talking a different word for the book.

09:14.483 --> 09:17.787
But now tell me where you... Have you always been...

09:17.767 --> 09:21.233
motivated to write or was it this novel?

09:21.653 --> 09:23.657
Now you mentioned you were a Senate page in 1979.

09:25.299 --> 09:29.246
Were you looking forward to a career in government or whatever?

09:29.286 --> 09:32.371
No, I've always written.

09:32.431 --> 09:42.087
I was the kid, the eight-year-old kid writing poems at night under the covers with the flashlight.

09:42.691 --> 09:46.296
And I had my first story.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.139
I won a writing contest when I was 11.

09:51.162 --> 09:53.184
And I've always written.

09:55.147 --> 10:01.775
And I think in part because I love language and I love story and also I'm a hungry reader.

10:03.558 --> 10:07.703
And I yearn for books that will move me.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.664
And will engage all my senses.

10:11.025 --> 10:16.991
So I think I write as much so that I can read as anything else.

10:18.732 --> 10:24.178
When did this novel start to... Well, I began the book when I was 20.

10:26.260 --> 10:29.263
And I worked on it essentially for 10 years.

10:30.244 --> 10:37.251
Once I got out of Stanford, I began the book...

10:37.383 --> 10:38.884
Were you in a writing project out there?

10:39.104 --> 10:39.305
No?

10:39.545 --> 10:39.825
Right.

10:39.945 --> 10:49.713
I began the book as a short story, and then in my senior year at Stanford, I wrote a novella as an honors thesis that was sort of the seed of the book.

10:52.035 --> 10:55.458
And then after I graduated, I worked as a copywriter.

10:57.220 --> 10:57.700
Where was this?

10:58.781 --> 10:59.762
Where was this?

10:59.782 --> 10:59.962
Yeah.

10:59.982 --> 11:07.288
For Ketchum Communications for the first year, and then I left Ketchum and was a freelancer for nine years.

11:07.522 --> 11:09.084
This is on the West Coast or?

11:09.684 --> 11:12.547
San Francisco.

11:12.567 --> 11:12.667
Okay.

11:12.687 --> 11:23.858
And so there was always the strain of working full time and also writing those late nights.

11:23.878 --> 11:28.082
Okay.

11:28.102 --> 11:35.790
And so this, so the novella which you did, again, is that part of this?

11:36.209 --> 11:44.057
It's not, you can't see it in the book, but it was the same characters and the same story.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.503
At what point did you decide to make it a generational kind of a thing?

11:50.524 --> 11:51.305
From the beginning.

11:52.346 --> 11:53.607
Even when it was a short story?

11:53.967 --> 11:55.169
Even when it was a short story.

11:55.369 --> 11:56.911
That's kind of hard, isn't it, for a story?

11:57.371 --> 11:57.791
Yeah, it was.

11:57.811 --> 12:01.255
That's why it wasn't, it was never a finished short story.

12:01.842 --> 12:11.435
I began writing Cassart's story, but the question for me is, what would this survivor of the genocide pass on?

12:13.437 --> 12:19.786
And how would the genocide not only affect her, but affect the successive generations and her family?

12:20.166 --> 12:22.129
And that, for me, is the seed of the book.

12:23.493 --> 12:30.306
At what point did you start to really get a voice, I mean a voice for the narrator?

12:30.487 --> 12:34.675
Well, that's the thing, Nick, that was so different for me.

12:34.835 --> 12:42.931
Cassard really came to me as a fully realized character.

12:42.951 --> 12:43.292
She did?

12:43.472 --> 12:44.234
Yeah.

12:44.975 --> 12:45.957
You can see her?

12:46.088 --> 12:46.749
Oh, yeah.

12:47.390 --> 12:47.950
Oh, yeah.

12:48.371 --> 12:50.033
Actually hear her voice, you know what it sounds like?

12:50.594 --> 13:03.169
It really, you know, I heard her voice and for... I spent a couple months just writing her voice and writing her story through her voice.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.912
And for me, my characters come to me.

13:05.972 --> 13:10.138
They come to me through their voices or they come to me in images.

13:11.679 --> 13:14.543
And it's a process of discovery to sort of see where...

13:15.434 --> 13:25.025
not only what their actions are, but to then add the insight to understand why they do what they do.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.929
So the voice and the character came first, right?

13:30.231 --> 13:30.351
Right.

13:30.371 --> 13:32.613
But clearly you had to develop a story as well.

13:32.653 --> 13:33.454
Right.

13:33.554 --> 13:36.237
Tell me how that began to emerge.

13:36.277 --> 13:42.184
Well, I think it's through a lot of, for me, it's a process of patient listening.

13:42.957 --> 13:48.062
to the things that are said, and especially to the things that are unsaid.

13:49.384 --> 13:52.887
In this family and with Cassard, so much is unsaid.

13:53.948 --> 14:01.336
And the things that are unsaid are in some ways the most potent and the most wounding.

14:04.639 --> 14:05.640
You know, the most loaded.

14:08.463 --> 14:12.407
And it's then my job as a writer to put that on the page and

14:13.214 --> 14:28.369
and to strip away anything that is excessive so that the reader really feels the power behind what these characters say and do.

14:29.732 --> 14:31.416
Are you working on another novel?

14:31.657 --> 14:32.218
I am.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.085
I can't really talk about it.

14:35.205 --> 14:38.790
Okay, but... Yeah, it's still in that... No, I understand that.

14:38.870 --> 14:45.179
I don't want you to, but does it follow in the same... No, very different.

14:45.199 --> 14:46.141
Very different story.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.863
Very different characters.

14:47.883 --> 14:52.750
I mean, so the Armenian-American experience has probably been expressed in this novel.

14:53.932 --> 14:54.853
I think so.

14:54.873 --> 14:58.999
Although there's a part of me that wonders if...

14:59.519 --> 15:05.445
10 years or so, I won't go back and find out what Seta's doing.

15:05.485 --> 15:08.348
I think at the end of the book, she's really just beginning her life.

15:09.529 --> 15:19.459
You see, are you concerned about, on the one hand, you say you don't want this to be perceived as a book about the genocide per se.

15:19.479 --> 15:26.286
I mean, you use that certainly as the premise with which you develop your characters in your story.

15:26.823 --> 15:33.293
But on the other hand, I think that it's almost unavoidable that you be identified as an Iranian.

15:33.373 --> 15:33.893
Oh, absolutely.

15:33.913 --> 15:41.825
And I don't mean that I don't want the book to be identified as related to an Iranian genocide.

15:41.885 --> 15:42.686
I'm glad for that.

15:42.706 --> 15:47.774
I don't want it to be simplified so that it's only about them.

15:47.934 --> 15:52.481
It would make one believe it's a historical novel about the genocide.

15:52.501 --> 15:56.627
And for me, the book is about the complexities that occur in this family.

15:57.856 --> 16:02.024
In your view, is it decidedly an American novel?

16:02.444 --> 16:04.187
Well, I think it is an American novel.

16:04.929 --> 16:08.515
I think so, too, but I would like you to address yourself to it.

16:09.517 --> 16:09.858
Yeah, right.

16:09.878 --> 16:11.440
And I think it's an American story.

16:12.222 --> 16:18.413
You know...

16:18.916 --> 16:21.700
As I said before, every family has its ghost.

16:21.740 --> 16:26.346
These ghosts are extreme, but I think in every family there are stories that get passed on.

16:27.027 --> 16:37.141
It's also an American story in the sense that in Cassard's generation, people were defined by their community and their family.

16:38.563 --> 16:43.670
Seta's generation, the third generation, the family has broken apart.

16:44.511 --> 16:46.273
The community no longer exists.

16:46.625 --> 16:51.613
And so the burden is on the individual to define herself.

16:52.774 --> 16:58.263
And in that sense, I think the book is really a story, a search for identity.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.710
Now, you said that you were working on this for 10 years?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.834
Yes.

17:06.696 --> 17:10.922
I suspect that this was done without a contractor.

17:10.942 --> 17:11.363
Is that right?

17:11.423 --> 17:12.284
Right, right.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.349
No, I sent it to my agent.

17:15.886 --> 17:18.872
I mean, you had an agent at that point, which is great, too.

17:18.892 --> 17:21.016
I mean, that's one of the hardest things in publishing.

17:21.718 --> 17:24.083
Well, I'll tell you what, let me tell you briefly.

17:25.044 --> 17:32.319
In 86, I went to a writer's conference, and my work was shown to an editor, Tom Jenks.

17:32.339 --> 17:33.101
I know Tom, yeah.

17:33.381 --> 17:34.764
Yeah, well, he's now my husband.

17:34.924 --> 17:35.506
You're kidding.

17:35.546 --> 17:36.207
No.

17:37.199 --> 17:39.423
I interviewed him.

17:39.443 --> 17:42.288
I did a piece on him years ago when he did the Hemingway.

17:42.409 --> 17:47.438
And in fact, I sent him, he'll remember me because this is cute.

17:48.380 --> 17:51.726
I sent him a copy of the book and asked him to inscribe it.

17:52.828 --> 17:54.972
And he inscribed it.

17:54.952 --> 17:56.934
upside down on the back.

17:58.336 --> 17:58.656
He did.

17:58.676 --> 18:04.403
And then he noticed it, and then he did it again on the front, which really makes it a unique one.

18:05.203 --> 18:06.145
I'm thrilled to have it.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.286
He should remember that.

18:07.426 --> 18:08.828
Oh, he will.

18:09.328 --> 18:11.250
I'll have to remind him.

18:11.270 --> 18:11.971
Oh, that's great.

18:12.352 --> 18:12.692
Yeah.

18:12.712 --> 18:14.494
Is Tom still editing now, might I ask?

18:14.514 --> 18:15.895
He is, and he's also writing.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.158
He's left full-time editing.

18:18.340 --> 18:18.821
Uh-huh.

18:18.841 --> 18:20.383
Well, he got out of Scribner's at the right time.

18:20.403 --> 18:27.916
I got out of Scribner's and went to GQ, where he was the literary editor, and he did that just because that was more of a part-time thing.

18:27.936 --> 18:35.989
He could work on his own fiction, and he's living in San Francisco and teaching and editing, but mostly doing his own writing.

18:36.009 --> 18:41.057
He had a book come out in 91 called Our Happiness, a Novel, and he did that work on a second.

18:41.138 --> 18:42.019
Well, that's great.

18:42.067 --> 18:42.588
Yeah.

18:43.049 --> 18:43.511
Oh, I'll have to.

18:43.571 --> 18:44.373
That's wonderful.

18:44.393 --> 18:44.553
Please.

18:44.573 --> 18:49.064
I just sold my own book, I might say, to Henry Holt.

18:50.969 --> 18:52.112
Oh, congratulations.

18:52.132 --> 18:52.332
Thank you.

18:52.352 --> 18:53.275
But it's not fiction.

18:53.295 --> 18:54.397
It's nonfiction.

18:54.417 --> 18:57.485
It's about bibliomania, book madness.

18:58.227 --> 18:58.287
Oh.

18:59.127 --> 19:02.312
People who love books always give me that response.

19:02.512 --> 19:10.745
It was a tough sell because the suspicion is only people who are bonkers over books will be interested in this.

19:11.526 --> 19:14.832
I'd love to see it, but then I'm bonkers.

19:14.932 --> 19:16.414
Well, I think it'll do just fine.

19:16.474 --> 19:18.958
I had a huge... I'm sorry, go ahead.

19:19.445 --> 19:43.697
it'll be out in about a year early spring next year if in fact it was once under contract to random house we didn't have to get it i was orphaned last year at random house when my editor left and went to another house and uh and i kind of went out in that same purge that that that uh joanie evans was uh awesome but you know you make out better in the long run

19:45.128 --> 19:51.255
I got Alan Peacock at Holt, and he's a wonderful editor, and he loves the book, and that means a lot.

19:52.676 --> 19:53.537
But who's your editor?

19:54.058 --> 19:54.759
Kate Medina.

19:55.700 --> 20:02.488
What I was going to say was that when, you know, it was always such a struggle to work this book.

20:02.788 --> 20:07.373
I had an image of the book when I first started writing it, a finished manuscript.

20:11.555 --> 20:14.281
that I would have to reach to write this book.

20:14.742 --> 20:18.870
And, you know, all these years of trying to finish it.

20:19.030 --> 20:24.462
And I really didn't want the external pressure of publishing and agents and all of that.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.225
And didn't have it anyway.

20:27.768 --> 20:32.398
But when I had been introduced by Tom,

20:32.918 --> 20:33.980
to Amanda Urban.

20:34.001 --> 20:36.105
This was long before Tom and I were involved.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.010
Actually, it's a longer story.

20:38.170 --> 20:38.591
That's okay.

20:38.611 --> 20:40.796
Well, give me what I can use.

20:47.091 --> 20:47.873
In 86...

20:48.393 --> 20:51.038
Amanda Urban heard about my work.

20:51.078 --> 20:52.020
Well, that's great.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.062
She's a wonderful agent.

20:53.123 --> 20:53.603
She is wonderful.

20:53.624 --> 20:54.505
And she called me.

20:55.006 --> 20:58.513
And I sent her 50 pages.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.337
And she said, great, when will the book be done?

21:00.357 --> 21:03.604
And I said, oh, six months.

21:03.624 --> 21:05.828
And six months turned into six years.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.133
And I didn't contact her until the book was done.

21:10.173 --> 21:11.696
She stuck with you all that time?

21:11.716 --> 21:13.438
Well, let me tell you what happened.

21:13.578 --> 21:19.787
I put the book, you know, the finished manuscript in a box and a cover letter on top saying, you know, I hope you remember me.

21:22.611 --> 21:23.793
This is now like 92.

21:23.933 --> 21:24.534
This is 92.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.597
October of 92.

21:26.958 --> 21:30.803
And...

21:31.036 --> 21:32.778
sent it off, hoping.

21:33.359 --> 21:37.685
And she called about four days later or five days later.

21:37.745 --> 21:44.234
She'd just gotten the manuscript the night before and called and said she'd stayed up most of the night reading it and was thrilled.

21:44.274 --> 21:44.815
That's great.

21:45.536 --> 21:47.299
And then things happened very quickly.

21:47.639 --> 21:59.456
On election day, the day Clinton got elected, she sent the book to several editors and told me, you know, it's going to be a couple weeks.

21:59.476 --> 22:00.537
It's a long book.

22:00.668 --> 22:02.390
you know, before we hear anything.

22:02.450 --> 22:05.073
And two days later, Kate Medina bought the book.

22:05.093 --> 22:05.893
Gee, that's wonderful.

22:06.374 --> 22:08.636
No, I mean, really, this is, I know a little bit about publishing.

22:08.656 --> 22:10.038
This is a pretty, pretty quick.

22:10.759 --> 22:11.139
Yeah.

22:11.159 --> 22:15.083
And if you sold the thing in October of 92, I mean, they did get you right out.

22:15.584 --> 22:21.870
And, you know, I suppose they could have gotten you out for fall of 93, but that would have been a rush.

22:22.411 --> 22:23.031
And who needs it?

22:23.191 --> 22:24.152
They did it very nicely.

22:24.172 --> 22:26.515
I think it's a good spring book for a first novel, too.

22:26.535 --> 22:27.456
Thank you.

22:27.476 --> 22:30.439
Well, it's just been, it's, it's, it's just, I, I,

22:30.689 --> 22:32.111
I'm just so pleased.

22:32.131 --> 22:45.091
You know, after 10 slow years writing alone in my room, it's just a great... Was this written on a word processor?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.635
Longhand and off the computer.

22:47.956 --> 22:52.423
Sometimes I draft in longhand to get the rhythm.

22:53.564 --> 22:55.307
How many drafts is it beyond?

22:55.327 --> 22:56.329
Oh, so many.

22:57.170 --> 22:58.452
When did you feel you were done?

22:59.647 --> 23:00.511
When did I?

23:00.611 --> 23:00.772
Yeah.

23:01.655 --> 23:04.246
When I sent it to Binky in October.

23:04.528 --> 23:07.279
Uh-huh.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.167
I finished the writing of the book.

23:09.822 --> 23:14.690
at the end of 1990, and then I spent almost two years editing.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.212
Did Duck Tom help you at all?

23:16.392 --> 23:16.673
Yes.

23:16.693 --> 23:22.061
I mean, that's great to have an editor of his stature and the family to look at it.

23:22.082 --> 23:22.302
He sure is.

23:22.322 --> 23:24.105
He's my first and best reader.

23:24.746 --> 23:25.407
I'll bet.

23:25.427 --> 23:28.251
And did he make any substantive suggestions to you?

23:28.592 --> 23:33.079
At a certain point, you know, once I'd finished the draft, he...

23:33.717 --> 23:35.540
He went through it with me.

23:36.361 --> 23:43.733
And, you know, at a certain point, every writer needs that other eye, you know, that completely objective eye.

23:43.753 --> 23:44.975
And he was just great.

23:46.597 --> 23:47.338
That's wonderful.

23:47.398 --> 23:47.819
Yeah.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.443
Yeah, I feel I'm lucky.

23:51.402 --> 23:53.344
Well, listen, I don't want to hold you up too much.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.687
We have had a nice half-hour chat.

23:55.707 --> 23:57.589
Do you feel like you've gotten what you need?

23:58.250 --> 24:00.673
I think I've got enough here for peace, yeah, actually.

24:01.153 --> 24:04.758
I do have the book, and that's usually the most important thing.

24:04.798 --> 24:10.444
And, you know, I really haven't questioned you why, because that's really not... I don't have to do that.

24:10.464 --> 24:17.312
I didn't mean to sound like I don't want the genocide brought up, because, you know, of course... Well, it's essential.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.233
It's essential.

24:18.313 --> 24:19.755
It's absolutely essential.

24:19.735 --> 24:21.257
I know what you're saying as well.

24:21.377 --> 24:27.204
This is not a fictionalized history of the genocide.

24:27.224 --> 24:39.279
It's how it affected a group of people and how it passes itself on and how you can never erase it.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.642
I think that's what we're talking about.

24:43.175 --> 24:43.976
Okay.

24:44.577 --> 24:52.806
Did you ever have any anxieties that this would be a great novel that stayed in somebody's manuscript, in somebody's closet?

24:53.007 --> 24:54.268
Of course I did.

24:54.749 --> 25:03.059
I often wondered throughout 10 years if I would be able to achieve the vision that I had.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.803
And I wasn't going to let it go until...

25:07.508 --> 25:10.312
I thought I had done what I set out to do.

25:11.013 --> 25:18.905
And so I questioned myself, would I be able to finish this book to my own liking?

25:19.486 --> 25:20.668
That was the first mission.

25:21.089 --> 25:22.331
Did you always have the title?

25:23.513 --> 25:25.516
The title came to me about five years in.

25:26.177 --> 25:31.685
And how did that happen?

25:32.767 --> 25:34.950
I was taking a long walk with a friend.

25:36.415 --> 25:38.037
And we were talking about titles.

25:38.057 --> 25:39.359
She's also a writer.

25:39.499 --> 25:40.861
And we were talking about titles.

25:42.803 --> 25:49.111
And I was complaining about my lack of title.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.835
And it just came to me.

25:54.759 --> 26:02.488
Have you heard, it's a little early yet because the book is just published, but have you heard anything at all from the various Armenian communities?

26:02.869 --> 26:02.929
No.

26:02.993 --> 26:03.594
I have.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.256
I'm just starting to hear.

26:05.276 --> 26:12.704
I don't know if you know that on Sunday there's going to be a reception and reading for me at the Armenian Library and Museum.

26:14.126 --> 26:18.791
And from what I hear, there's going to be a big crowd of people.

26:19.072 --> 26:19.672
Where is that?

26:20.073 --> 26:20.934
That's in Watertown.

26:22.435 --> 26:24.378
Uh-huh.

26:24.398 --> 26:27.802
But what I've heard, it's been really wonderful, Nick.

26:27.862 --> 26:31.566
I mean, I've just heard such relief and...

26:35.528 --> 26:58.583
excitement about the book and a feeling particularly for the third generation armenian americans but others as well all different generations that finally the story is being told but i've also heard from quite a few readers who are not armenian who have said to me this is my family story you know specifics are different but you know that was my grandmother

26:59.221 --> 27:01.344
That's exactly what happened in our family.

27:01.484 --> 27:02.465
You know, being a Greek.

27:04.007 --> 27:04.328
Yeah, of course.

27:04.348 --> 27:14.381
I'd have to tell you about the similarity and the feelings that Greeks have for Turkish oppressors, right?

27:14.782 --> 27:15.343
Right.

27:16.023 --> 27:23.153
But I actually had a South African journalist interview me, and she said at the beginning of the interview, she said, I've got to tell you this book.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.330
this book could be my life.

27:26.111 --> 27:29.074
These same women are in my family.

27:29.134 --> 27:37.321
And my whole struggle has been to sort of heal the wounds and get on with my own story.

27:38.162 --> 27:42.145
You notice I haven't once asked you the question, but I may as well at this point.

27:42.966 --> 27:48.991
Do you sense any perception on the part of any readers that this could be judged?

27:49.192 --> 27:50.473
A women's novel?

27:50.493 --> 27:50.553
No?

27:51.213 --> 27:53.055
A woman's novel?

27:53.508 --> 28:00.117
You know, because the main characters are women, one might wonder about that.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.080
But I've had great reception from a lot of men.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.785
Well, you've got Bob Stonebler, and he doesn't pass those out.

28:07.106 --> 28:07.887
No, he doesn't.

28:08.127 --> 28:14.495
And Rick Bass and others who've been very excited about the book.

28:14.515 --> 28:19.642
You know, George Loon is a very important character in the book.

28:19.662 --> 28:19.802
Mm-hmm.

28:20.035 --> 28:28.867
This is a guy who's done his work, he's provided for this family, he's loved his wife, and still the marriage breaks down.

28:30.369 --> 28:36.938
And I think his story is... I feel a lot for George Lone.

28:36.978 --> 28:39.321
I think he's a quiet hero in the book.

28:42.025 --> 28:43.627
So I don't know.

28:43.667 --> 28:44.608
I mean, do...

28:44.943 --> 28:48.848
There are men's books and we don't call them men's books.

28:48.868 --> 28:50.450
Of course not, yeah.

28:50.470 --> 29:01.242
I guess in terms of who your central characters are, I guess for a first novel it does make sense to write from the viewpoint of a woman too, I think.

29:01.703 --> 29:06.108
Well, it's the way the story came to me.

29:06.248 --> 29:06.509
Right.

29:06.529 --> 29:08.571
I've written stories from men's point of view.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.394
That hasn't intimidated you at all?

29:11.474 --> 29:13.457
No, no.

29:13.477 --> 29:13.617
Mm-hmm.

29:13.951 --> 29:17.296
Where did you say your other... Now, this is your first novel.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.739
Have you published stories elsewhere?

29:18.759 --> 29:25.509
I published stories when I was in college in very small magazines.

29:25.529 --> 29:28.614
But this is really my first major publication.

29:28.634 --> 29:29.856
That's great.

29:29.876 --> 29:29.976
Yeah.

29:29.996 --> 29:32.360
And what's the first printing, just out of curiosity?

29:32.861 --> 29:34.584
You'll have to ask Random House about that.

29:34.644 --> 29:36.126
I know it's a large printing.

29:36.246 --> 29:36.507
Really?

29:37.268 --> 29:37.408
Uh-huh.

29:37.668 --> 29:39.611
But I don't actually have the number.

29:39.872 --> 29:39.992
Great.

29:40.529 --> 29:44.655
And, of course, it's a little early yet to say how it's doing, I guess.

29:44.695 --> 29:47.920
Well, you know, it's on the San Francisco Chronicle's bestseller list.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.662
For the first two weeks it was in the store.

29:49.682 --> 29:49.963
Wow.

29:50.143 --> 29:53.488
We were all amazed because there hasn't been any publicity out there.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.290
Pat Holt hasn't done anything with it out there yet?

29:55.310 --> 29:55.731
Not yet.

29:55.791 --> 29:57.273
I guess this weekend.

29:57.313 --> 29:57.453
Uh-huh.

29:57.474 --> 29:58.295
She's doing something.

29:58.936 --> 29:59.997
So that was great.

30:00.338 --> 30:01.399
That's terrific.

30:01.419 --> 30:01.800
Yeah.

30:01.820 --> 30:02.881
And we hear it's selling.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.146
It's moving quickly.

30:06.647 --> 30:06.807
Yeah.

30:07.411 --> 30:08.253
That's great.

30:09.014 --> 30:10.958
Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you.

30:10.978 --> 30:12.480
Oh, yeah, good to talk to you, too.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.384
Please say hello to your husband.

30:15.386 --> 30:15.566
I will.

30:15.646 --> 30:17.189
Remind him of that little story.

30:17.209 --> 30:18.692
In fact, I interviewed him in New York.

30:18.712 --> 30:19.734
It wasn't a telephoner.

30:19.834 --> 30:25.705
As I remember, I think I went to Scribner's and interviewed him there, as I recall.

30:26.426 --> 30:26.767
I think.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.029
Maybe I'm wrong.

30:28.590 --> 30:30.033
But I definitely remember meeting him.

30:30.253 --> 30:30.313
Oh.

30:31.306 --> 30:31.927
Okay.

30:32.488 --> 30:35.612
So I'll make sure you get tear sheets.

30:36.012 --> 30:36.513
Okay.

30:36.533 --> 30:36.913
Terrific.

30:36.933 --> 30:37.354
That'd be great.

30:37.394 --> 30:38.535
When is it going to come out?

30:38.756 --> 30:39.957
I don't know just yet.

30:40.137 --> 30:42.561
I do have a number of other pieces.

30:44.483 --> 30:48.729
I've done about five interviews this week, and I really do have to shuffle them and see when they're wrong.

30:49.550 --> 30:50.731
Unfortunately, I do one a week.

30:53.575 --> 30:57.059
So where it will fit in the mix, but it'll be within the next three or four weeks.

30:57.500 --> 30:57.600
Okay.

30:57.833 --> 30:58.294
Okay.

30:58.374 --> 30:59.114
Terrific, Nick.

30:59.134 --> 30:59.255
Good.

30:59.455 --> 31:00.015
Take care.

31:00.035 --> 31:00.356
Thank you.

31:00.376 --> 31:00.716
You too.

31:00.977 --> 31:01.237
Bye-bye.

31:08.425 --> 31:10.227
Starting with tape recorder now, and it's on.

31:12.209 --> 31:17.235
I guess the first question is, how did you come to choose?

31:17.295 --> 31:24.583
I mean, it seems so obvious, but nevertheless, how you came to choose during a life of Louise Collet?

31:24.648 --> 31:30.915
There are two avenues to that, as they're often on in the writing of books.

31:30.935 --> 31:43.108
One is that in my book on Soviet women, I got increasingly interested in the issue of how women had been silenced in different ways throughout the centuries.

31:43.208 --> 31:50.375
I mean, the Soviet women had been silenced by the fact that they were never allowed to organize as women.

31:50.395 --> 31:51.837
They were never allowed to...

31:52.070 --> 31:55.555
they were health problems specific to Soviet women.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.517
They were never allowed to have a feminist movement.

31:57.998 --> 32:12.036
They were just Soviet citizens of the capital C and really sort of de-gendered and their gripes were just completely unheard and also not allowed to be spoken of as particular women's problems, you know.

32:12.817 --> 32:16.342
And that's a point I elaborated at length in my last book.

32:16.382 --> 32:21.148
And I began to be curious about the different ways women have been silenced and

32:21.652 --> 32:33.425
Many years ago, I had re-read a great biography of Flaubert called Flaubert and Madame Bovary by Francis Tegmo, an American writer.

32:33.445 --> 32:34.266
It's a wonderful book.

32:34.467 --> 32:39.773
Oh, it's one of the greatest, still the best biography of Flaubert I think ever done.

32:40.674 --> 32:45.820
And I was... He says some very nice things about your book, incidentally.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.823
Yes, well, I think we have sort of mutual interest.

32:49.057 --> 33:03.548
And I happened to be a friend of the family, a friend of my husband, and I had dinner with him in the early 80s right after, well, right after it finished, you know, for the second time he read his book.

33:04.430 --> 33:07.076
And I said, has anybody ever done a biography of Louis Calais?

33:07.457 --> 33:09.040
And he said, forget it, dear.

33:09.323 --> 33:11.568
all the letters to him were burned.

33:11.848 --> 33:16.158
So I went back and thought, well, they were burned, so that's another project out of the way.

33:17.020 --> 33:26.961
And then in the middle of my Soviet research, I was lying in bed in some flea-ridden hotel in Uzbekistan about me.

33:27.700 --> 33:33.126
And I woke up in the middle of the night in a rage saying, the letters were British.

33:33.147 --> 33:33.967
That's why I have to do the biography.

33:34.008 --> 33:35.169
May I just interject?

33:35.449 --> 33:41.096
In fact, a question I had for you is that statement at the beginning of the book.

33:41.136 --> 33:46.222
It is that scene where you have Flaubert burning the letters with de Maupassant.

33:46.242 --> 33:48.245
And you said, that's the reason I write this book.

33:48.265 --> 33:50.427
And I said, my God, that sounds a little too simplistic.

33:50.467 --> 33:53.691
But apparently that actually is the...

33:53.671 --> 33:57.676
In the wider context of my interest, in the world, within the world.

33:57.696 --> 34:02.062
Let me just say, if the letters existed, would you have written this book?

34:03.163 --> 34:11.133
I think I would have, but I think the thing is that I think 20 other people might have done it as well.

34:11.894 --> 34:14.638
Well, you think those letters really would have been the key to her?

34:15.058 --> 34:22.868
Well, I think one of the keys to her were her journals, which are only recovered in the 1960s or 70s.

34:23.219 --> 34:27.304
I tell that story towards the end of the book of how the journals had been... Exactly, right.

34:27.324 --> 34:28.025
...since 1910.

34:28.205 --> 34:33.252
And I think really without the journals, I don't think one could have done a biography of it.

34:33.272 --> 34:44.807
But with the journals, which I began to look at, they appeared, extracts of them had appeared throughout the 80s in French academic publications.

34:45.287 --> 34:48.231
And I began to look at them, and I thought they were really a gold mine.

34:49.038 --> 35:14.723
for a book on her, because there are a couple of the first drafts of her letters to Philip, but there are also the drafts of her letters to many other men, and it's just a wonderful kind of glimpse, these journals, into the whole kind of social, psychosexual aura of the mid-19th century Paris intelligentsia.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.387
So when I began to research, and I

35:18.755 --> 35:22.141
And I found those journals, and I really knew I had hit a gold mine.

35:22.642 --> 35:33.763
And they were not really classified and not available until accessible, really, until the 1980s when they were placed, you know, classified and so on, and placed in the municipal library of Avenue.

35:33.803 --> 35:35.025
Why did it take that long?

35:35.360 --> 35:38.726
Well, her handwriting is simply appalling.

35:39.167 --> 35:44.236
But I mean, as archival documents, however, they were accessible.

35:44.697 --> 35:51.570
Maybe they were accessible even in the 1970s, but it just took a few years to catalog them, to classify them.

35:52.011 --> 35:56.980
This huge black suitcase full of Calais documents returned from Belgium.

35:57.483 --> 35:59.225
in the late 60s or early 70s.

35:59.265 --> 36:00.866
We don't know exactly that.

36:00.886 --> 36:02.869
I mean, everybody is so old who tells a story.

36:02.989 --> 36:07.994
It can't be, but it must be late 60s, early 70s.

36:08.354 --> 36:13.019
By the time they're catalogued, you know, the French library system is very kind of sleepy.

36:13.039 --> 36:24.891
And by the time they're catalogued and classified and the journals are catalogued by themselves and put on microfilm because they're very fragile and very bad condition so that the microfilming takes some time.

36:25.276 --> 36:28.281
and generally made accessible to the library user.

36:28.321 --> 36:29.222
It's a couple of years.

36:29.242 --> 36:29.823
Sure.

36:30.224 --> 36:32.888
You did all your own translations, too, I know.

36:32.908 --> 36:51.638
Yeah, I did all my own translations, and that I'm grateful to my Russian mother, who never really learned English properly and lived here 49 years, still getting the world news from the Russian, white Russian paper, the Novaya Ruska Slova,

36:51.871 --> 36:59.501
and from the Seattle Palace, so that I haven't lost an ounce of my French.

37:00.182 --> 37:08.414
If you had a choice, clearly you didn't, but if you had a choice between the journals and the letters to Flaubert, which would you choose?

37:10.216 --> 37:12.219
I think I'd choose the letters.

37:12.519 --> 37:13.120
You would?

37:13.454 --> 37:16.357
The journals are awfully good.

37:16.518 --> 37:20.102
They cover more of a period of her life, though, don't they?

37:20.122 --> 37:21.504
Well, not necessarily.

37:21.984 --> 37:32.817
She started writing the journals in about 43, 44, and there are many years that are missing.

37:32.877 --> 37:36.762
There are no journal entries for 46 years.

37:37.096 --> 37:43.444
They're very, those journals are fairly sports, and what's really fascinating, but they're fairly sports, and they skip whole years.

37:43.464 --> 37:46.107
We suspect that a lot was just lost.

37:47.328 --> 37:55.698
And so they don't start early enough in time to give her a glimpse of her youth or anything.

37:55.758 --> 37:55.858
Sure.

37:55.938 --> 38:01.585
And they stop in about 54 or 55.

38:01.987 --> 38:10.401
Therefore, they cover not too large a period of a life than the letters to Flaubert would have.

38:10.761 --> 38:15.368
And of course, now the letters to Flaubert would have covered about eight years, right?

38:15.629 --> 38:16.791
About eight years.

38:17.933 --> 38:22.560
What do you fear was lost in those letters?

38:23.384 --> 38:26.289
Well, one was lost in those letters.

38:26.409 --> 38:33.140
I mean, beyond the fact that there would be an extraordinary archive, and it would be the other side of the correspondence, of course.

38:33.260 --> 38:37.567
But I mean, in terms of the essence of this woman, I guess, is what I'm asking.

38:37.587 --> 38:39.430
Well, I think there are several things I miss.

38:39.450 --> 38:43.036
One, her wonderfully inflammable temper.

38:43.076 --> 38:44.599
I mean, I love it when she loses the temper.

38:44.619 --> 38:45.520
She's very irascible.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.964
I wouldn't want her as a friend, by the way.

38:47.984 --> 38:49.527
I'd like to have been a member of this panel.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.784
That would have been wonderful, wouldn't it?

38:52.804 --> 38:53.024
Yeah, yeah.

38:53.044 --> 38:54.567
Because it was really a very interesting salon.

38:54.667 --> 38:59.013
But I'm not sure I would have wanted her as a friend.

38:59.794 --> 39:04.700
And she was kind of a needy narcissist, you know, those women of bad news.

39:05.021 --> 39:07.885
But the men certainly found her irresistible, didn't they?

39:08.005 --> 39:08.906
Many of them did.

39:09.928 --> 39:10.729
Many of them did.

39:10.769 --> 39:16.797
And I think that what I would have missed the most

39:17.097 --> 39:22.266
what I miss the most, what I would have most looked long for in her letters to Fleur, several things.

39:22.406 --> 39:26.152
One is that flair of temper, which I find is very interesting.

39:26.172 --> 39:39.335
And when she gets angry, the language gets so kind of heated up and pungent, like those letters to that deputy, you know, who was sickle and had venereal disease, whatever.

39:39.355 --> 39:41.839
I mean, the letters to him have a wonderful kind of

39:42.275 --> 39:47.040
tautness and chutzpah and, you know, energy, the energy of anger.

39:48.843 --> 39:49.884
I would have missed that.

39:50.204 --> 40:00.176
I would have missed the whole kind of commentary on the social scene in Paris, which she gives so well to Hugo in those letters of 54, 55, 56.

40:00.536 --> 40:01.938
Those letters are just wonderful.

40:02.018 --> 40:05.802
I mean, the whole commentary on the court of Napoleon in the suit.

40:06.220 --> 40:12.652
so that she was always documenting the scene, who she saw at the opera, who she saw such or that for, what people said to each other.

40:13.092 --> 40:18.903
And it's just one more glimpse into a second period of French literature.

40:19.805 --> 40:28.380
And then I would have also missed, I would have loved to have seen how she reacted to what he told her

40:28.765 --> 40:31.589
was the shape of his book.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.273
That's the stuff that would really fascinate me, I think, too.

40:34.333 --> 40:43.727
That's what would fascinate me maybe the most, is to what degree did he... Participate in the creative process, I guess.

40:43.847 --> 40:44.528
Exactly.

40:44.548 --> 40:46.450
Because actually, that's what I miss the most.

40:47.853 --> 40:56.545
Because certainly he is documenting the progress of the book in such detail to her that...

40:57.402 --> 41:04.075
You can't help but miss what she would have, what kind of advice, you know, what kind of input she would have given him.

41:04.696 --> 41:13.493
When you began the project, were you very, I mean, that familiar with, I mean, she won the Academy Francis, what, four times for her poetry?

41:13.914 --> 41:15.377
Were you that familiar with her work?

41:15.998 --> 41:16.600
No, I wasn't.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.904
Very few of us are because...

41:19.559 --> 41:22.203
They're not, you know, they're all out of print.

41:22.223 --> 41:23.745
You have to look them up in libraries.

41:24.726 --> 41:38.166
Somehow the name had come through to me over a decade ago, even before that last encounter with Stigmore and before that last particular rereading of his work.

41:38.186 --> 41:49.482
I think it had somehow in the 70s, I came across her in some history of French feminism or something, as being the first woman to make a living

41:49.613 --> 41:50.834
completely by her pen.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.938
She was, in fact, a woman of letters.

41:54.419 --> 42:09.577
She was a woman of letters, and she made, I think the woman who was of that claim to fame in British literature is a woman called Afra Ben, late 17th century, early 18th century writer, who is always said to be the first woman to support herself completely by her pen.

42:09.958 --> 42:11.920
Well, Louise certainly had to.

42:11.940 --> 42:18.608
I mean, she was a single mother, and she was supporting her kids solely through her writings, and it's a very contemporary

42:19.162 --> 42:27.951
flavor to all her anguishes about how was she going to do with a single mother and how was she going to do with a single, you know, breadwinner.

42:28.492 --> 42:30.454
I think very significant you point out.

42:30.514 --> 42:35.739
Unlike George Sand, you know, she kept the woman's name.

42:35.859 --> 42:37.741
I mean, she didn't... She did.

42:37.881 --> 42:38.281
She did.

42:38.442 --> 42:48.612
And also, those other women who were writing the timing, if you take Sand and Marie Dagoo, that lover of lists whom I mentioned,

42:49.064 --> 42:57.274
All these women came from the aristocracy and were kind of protected by the fact that they came from the aristocracy.

42:57.294 --> 43:04.162
This is a very interesting comment on the elitism of the French ethos.

43:04.863 --> 43:14.835
When Barbet de Réveilly made those vast attacks on her in the book that came out in 1882 called The Blue Stockings, he

43:15.271 --> 43:20.336
I denied that she had ever come from an old gentry family.

43:20.376 --> 43:25.780
She said she was born into a family of Marseille fishmongers and talked like that.

43:26.221 --> 43:27.202
That is a very interesting thing.

43:27.222 --> 43:28.823
Why should he demote her?

43:28.903 --> 43:33.587
And then this example followed and everybody was saying she didn't even come from the gentry.

43:33.968 --> 43:36.630
She came from some little merchant family in Marseille.

43:37.050 --> 43:44.417
They were aping the big critics' words who had invented it just out of whole cloth as a way of demoting her because

43:44.768 --> 43:59.942
She cared very much for her ancestry, for these distinguished members of the Promo South Parliament, for the grandfather who had fought to have been a leader of the revolution and had a great Christian library and was a kind of, you know, a country gentleman.

44:00.582 --> 44:06.748
And by demoting her social status, they found that she was all the more vulnerable to attack.

44:07.108 --> 44:13.594
That is vicious, but very, very significant to the illegitimate of the French system.

44:13.754 --> 44:14.775
Do you see what I mean?

44:15.413 --> 44:19.458
denying her even a noble or gentile birth.

44:23.083 --> 44:29.691
To get back to her writing, obviously, since you began the project, you've read her work.

44:30.112 --> 44:30.833
How do you judge her?

44:30.893 --> 44:32.735
How does she stand up as a poet?

44:34.297 --> 44:44.070
Well, she doesn't stand up that well, but I think she's absolutely parallel to the kind of art that was being rewarded

44:44.506 --> 44:56.663
in the kind of visual art that was being rewarded in the salons of the, I mean the salons, the yearly exhibition of painting, not literary, social salons.

44:56.683 --> 45:11.323
In the salons, they always happen in May, so it's called Salon de May, of the visual arts, which rewarded, punctually rewarded every year, the most kitschy kind of sentimental realism

45:11.759 --> 45:15.023
It was not, you know, it was not a time for prophetic art yet.

45:15.043 --> 45:21.009
I mean, Courbet was already painting, but was poor as a church mouse and was scoffed at.

45:22.071 --> 45:41.192
And the people who were being rewarded, people that you will never hear of again, like, well, Pradier himself, her friend James Pradier, at whose studio she met Robert, has done a lot of huge key-tip 90th-century sculptures that still stands in Paris.

45:41.527 --> 45:43.491
And he was considered the greatest friend sculptor.

45:43.511 --> 45:47.658
What I'm saying is that it was a time of very bad taste.

45:47.758 --> 45:54.951
Sometimes I think bad taste was invented in the 1860s, you know, with the sort of mass media that came before then.

45:55.252 --> 46:01.122
Would she be of interest to you if she were not the muse to Flaubert?

46:04.173 --> 46:09.260
I don't think she... I'm not sure she would have... Maybe not to a general reading public, but how about to you?

46:10.521 --> 46:21.335
She would still be of interest... I mean, if she had been deprived of oral boyfriends... Well, let's just take Flaubert out of the equation.

46:21.395 --> 46:24.439
Everything else remaining equal, the same.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.362
I'm not sure.

46:26.382 --> 46:28.284
I mean, I've got to be very honest with you.

46:28.445 --> 46:31.108
I'm not sure she would have left all those books behind.

46:31.669 --> 46:34.112
I'm not sure that the books would have been commented.

46:34.447 --> 46:36.450
I'm not sure that they even would have survived.

46:38.052 --> 46:44.821
Because of the fact that she was Flaubert's... And Madame Bovary, of course, beyond that.

46:45.041 --> 46:46.363
And he models of Madame Bovary.

46:46.964 --> 46:53.813
Every ten years at the anniversary of her death, there was a spate of articles on her throughout the full French press.

46:54.574 --> 47:00.202
And then the 50th anniversary came along, it was 1926.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.306
And there was a huge bit of art all over, you know.

47:03.522 --> 47:09.149
This is the 50th anniversary of the death of Madame Calais, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47:09.930 --> 47:14.596
And the focus is always on Flaubert.

47:15.157 --> 47:25.410
And then they print some new letter of his from Bouyer to him or from Bouyer concerning her or something like that.

47:25.911 --> 47:30.897
I'm not sure that she would even have been commented that much if she...

47:31.501 --> 47:36.246
had just been his subject.

47:37.508 --> 47:48.540
And I fear, but I mean, I accept the fact that one has to, you know, it's by one, you know, you get two.

47:48.640 --> 47:54.146
I mean, you go into Flaubert's life and you get Flaubert in the bargain, which is a huge thing.

47:55.107 --> 48:00.613
You can't study Flaubert properly without studying Flaubert well also, because

48:01.032 --> 48:04.196
And that's what people failed to do for decades.

48:04.756 --> 48:18.111
They had this really vicious and very unfair, totally undocumented take on her, which I think all this got corrected curiously when Flaubert studies fell into Anglo-American hands.

48:18.171 --> 48:19.453
I think they began to do it much better.

48:19.953 --> 48:28.002
I think the tradition of misogyny in France is just far worse and far deeper than anything we suffered from in the Anglo-American.

48:28.083 --> 48:36.452
What was your attitude regarding Flaubert before you began the project and now what is it afterwards?

48:36.874 --> 48:40.185
I've had to read him so carefully.

48:40.537 --> 48:45.044
That if anything, my esteem for genius is even greater.

48:45.144 --> 48:45.444
Really?

48:46.205 --> 48:47.908
Yeah.

48:48.008 --> 48:55.599
I don't quote other reviews in my pieces, but I know the Times piece was very critical of your estimation.

48:55.940 --> 49:02.630
Oh, well, I mean, Michiko, I mean, the thing is that, you know, I think she's attacking for the sake of attacking at this point.

49:02.650 --> 49:10.341
I mean, I don't mind being quoted by that because eight days later she ran an really unjustified attack on Janet Malcolm.

49:10.928 --> 49:12.150
on the book on Sylvia Plath.

49:12.811 --> 49:13.352
Did you read that?

49:13.573 --> 49:13.893
I did.

49:14.214 --> 49:17.379
Well, I mean, it was forward.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.182
I mean, it was just impossible.

49:19.242 --> 49:28.819
A few weeks before, she'd attacked Updike's Brazil in ways that, I mean, one might like or not like the book, but there's no reason for that kind of...

49:28.985 --> 49:30.308
Viciousness of attack.

49:30.388 --> 49:32.914
Well, it did seem a bit personal, didn't it?

49:32.934 --> 49:34.317
All these attacks were very personal.

49:35.700 --> 49:46.142
Actually, the one on me was the least personal of the three attacks, but then she's been attacking left and right, and I think it's a principle of attack she's answered that I don't really pay attention to.

49:46.183 --> 49:46.403
Okay.

49:46.383 --> 49:51.430
But she's the only one who said that I'm trying to diminish him.

49:51.610 --> 49:54.814
Well, I have to say, I read the review before I read the book.

49:55.034 --> 49:58.439
And the book is not what I expected from having read the review.

49:59.880 --> 50:06.008
I can cite at least ten instances where you aren't qualified and you're praised for him as a writer.

50:06.669 --> 50:07.350
Well, yes.

50:07.450 --> 50:15.040
And I think over the bunch of most reviews that the biography is

50:15.408 --> 50:25.907
is measured because I don't make any great claims for her talent and also because I don't ever try to diminish

50:26.225 --> 50:43.734
And I think I very carefully questioned you about this earlier, where I asked you to evaluate the woman as a, Louise, as a writer, and I think you basically said she'd be forgotten today if it weren't for her relationship with Flaubert.

50:43.854 --> 50:46.559
So, I mean, you're being consistent with this all along.

50:46.699 --> 50:50.325
I think I am, and I think I have to be honest.

50:50.930 --> 50:58.421
I have to be honest and say I think she would have been, she might well have been forgotten.

50:58.561 --> 51:06.012
And similarly, you aren't dismissing Flaubert as a writer of consequence either, I don't think.

51:06.032 --> 51:07.054
Not in the least bit.

51:07.154 --> 51:11.040
As she suggests in her review, I think she suggests that you do that.

51:11.220 --> 51:12.742
No, she suggests that I diminish Flaubert.

51:12.762 --> 51:13.323
That's what I'm saying.

51:13.343 --> 51:17.950
She suggests that you, Michiko makes that suggestion in her review, I think.

51:17.930 --> 51:36.347
But it's silly because what she's alleging is that by perhaps focusing on the more unattractive traits of his character, I'm diminishing him as a writer as if there was ever any connection between character and talent or character and genius.

51:36.967 --> 51:46.296
I mean, aren't we all used to the idea that geniuses can be off and off vicious and extremely odious people?

51:46.436 --> 51:47.397
I mean, from...

51:47.900 --> 51:58.896
If you look at Baudelaire or certain aspects of Dickens' character were pretty ghastly also, and all through the history of arts and letters.

51:58.916 --> 52:01.479
We've got great Jesus' behaving atrociously towards each other.

52:01.499 --> 52:12.355
And so to point out his misogyny, or always sort of praising his devotion to his male friends and his loyalty to his male friends, which is already a great quality,

52:12.807 --> 52:18.118
It has nothing to do with my estimation of him as a writer.

52:18.138 --> 52:28.200
It's a very primitive association which alleges that if I diminish him in any way or if I cast any slight on his character, I am diminishing him.

52:28.383 --> 52:30.947
my summation of his talent, which is actually crazy.

52:32.850 --> 52:39.702
And I think it's clear also that you never began this work as a work of literary criticism either.

52:40.023 --> 52:46.774
I mean, the point here is not to discuss Madame Bovary as a literary work.

52:46.834 --> 52:48.377
I mean, that's established.

52:50.400 --> 52:54.627
You're doing something else quite aside from that.

52:55.298 --> 53:02.025
It is amazing how much material you were able to find, though, I mean, in the various libraries in France.

53:03.326 --> 53:08.752
I mean, did you think that you would be able to penetrate this woman as much as you were able to do?

53:09.313 --> 53:20.344
Well, I felt, as soon as I was exposed to the journals, and as soon as I read through the letters, the letters,

53:20.527 --> 53:35.750
In the new edition, another reason why it would have been very dull to try this book, to do this book, earlier than, let's say, the late 70s, is that the first unexplicated edition of Flaubert's letters came out.

53:35.770 --> 53:42.640
And in that play yard edition that they put all the French breaks in, it was heavily censored.

53:42.760 --> 53:49.150
I mean, there were no dirty words, either in his letters to her or in his letters to his buddies.

53:49.535 --> 54:00.625
all those descriptions, you know, the brothel scene or the bordello scenes and the low descriptions of the lovemaking with the hordes and so on.

54:01.306 --> 54:02.227
None of that existed.

54:02.347 --> 54:02.887
None of that.

54:03.628 --> 54:13.797
And the whole bordello scene, the whole prostitution scene is very important in this day relation because he was treating her in a way she felt like a prostitute.

54:13.857 --> 54:19.322
And these new women, these newly liberated women or women who were striving for a new degree of

54:19.657 --> 54:26.967
self-wrought liberation, had this terrible hang-up that they, in this process, they might be mistaken for prostitutes.

54:27.028 --> 54:28.850
Do you know what I mean?

54:28.870 --> 54:29.010
Mm-hmm.

54:29.431 --> 54:40.687
And that was a, that's a recurring refrain in her, in her recurring sex, in her letters to him, or her notes to him, or her reactions, obviously.

54:41.108 --> 54:42.089
It's, who do you think I am?

54:42.149 --> 54:43.932
I mean, you're not treating me like a lady.

54:44.212 --> 54:46.275
Why can't I have a cup of tea with your mom, you know?

54:46.335 --> 54:46.896
Mm-hmm.

54:47.213 --> 55:00.348
I had forgotten that he was a syphilitic, too, and all the mercury he took for his... I'm amazed she stayed with him as long as she did, to tell you the truth.

55:02.210 --> 55:02.630
Let's see.

55:02.930 --> 55:04.272
Obviously, I haven't asked you about the book.

55:04.292 --> 55:05.994
The book takes care of itself.

55:06.114 --> 55:10.639
We're just kind of getting some things here.

55:11.530 --> 55:13.273
Is this a book of anger?

55:13.393 --> 55:18.621
I mean, is this a book, are you an angry woman when you're writing this book?

55:21.966 --> 55:23.708
No, I think I'm a compassionate woman.

55:24.289 --> 55:40.373
I think I'm reflecting on, I really enjoy reflecting on our forerunners, on those women who just even, even just a little, if they only blazed a tiny bit of a path or tried to blaze a tiny bit of a path,

55:40.825 --> 55:44.170
to trace all the reasons why it was so difficult for them.

55:44.830 --> 56:09.364
So that we might both, as women, contemporary women, that we might both be grateful for the little we have, or maybe the lot we have, depending on how you view it, and aware of how earlier women went about getting the freedom that

56:09.766 --> 56:14.871
you know, they were beginning to, whose rewards were beginning to reach.

56:14.891 --> 56:29.604
I think that was really the main thrust of my search, is to find parallels and paradoxes in the female condition, to deepen my sense of parallels and paradoxes in the female condition.

56:30.385 --> 56:33.448
What do you think she expected from the relationship with Flaubert?

56:33.988 --> 56:37.331
Well, I think she was very much of a bourgeois lady.

56:37.351 --> 56:39.013
She wanted to marry him.

56:39.196 --> 56:59.762
I mean, I think one of the contradictions of her character that with all the rebelliousness and all the left-wing pamphleteering and sloganeering, she was in part a very bourgeois, decorous lady.

57:00.423 --> 57:04.769
And she wanted that stable relationship.

57:04.789 --> 57:07.212
She wanted to be treated like a lady of her birth.

57:07.917 --> 57:11.765
And I think that that's what threw him so off balance.

57:11.785 --> 57:13.268
As a result, he didn't know how to treat her.

57:15.733 --> 57:22.948
His refusal to let her into the house, into his mother's house, is an important act of great confusion.

57:23.168 --> 57:27.377
He's thrown off balance by her because...

57:28.032 --> 57:29.855
He doesn't know what she is.

57:29.895 --> 57:31.859
She's a new kind of woman.

57:31.879 --> 57:34.544
He's kind of a sitting duck for Freudians, isn't he, though?

57:35.225 --> 57:46.466
Well, I think another interesting aspect of the book is that maybe he's one of the last two generations or so of writers who have not read Freud.

57:47.388 --> 57:48.370
And, I mean...
