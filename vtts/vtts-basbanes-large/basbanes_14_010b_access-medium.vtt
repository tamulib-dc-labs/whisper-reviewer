WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:10.166
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:10.206 --> 00:18.536
Hey, Cyril must be a member here.

00:18.896 --> 00:29.548
He's quite a book man.

00:32.245 --> 00:35.448
A few castles, questions late.

00:35.508 --> 00:41.975
Seems to be helpful.

00:41.995 --> 00:55.790
It's difficult to keep up the trends off.

00:55.830 --> 01:01.476
The reading section, the reading section.

01:02.131 --> 01:08.698
a century ago, when it's been there.

01:09.399 --> 01:17.508
And, erm, those bantles collapsed with the wake of me.

01:17.528 --> 01:22.714
So, it was real, and, er, what is it she was saying?

01:22.974 --> 01:25.417
Did it actually collapse?

01:25.437 --> 01:25.998
No, it didn't.

01:26.018 --> 01:30.683
But I mean, it was obviously weak and couldn't bear any more.

01:30.703 --> 01:30.923
So, erm...

01:35.543 --> 01:53.233
In that way, we're going to show how we call our Victorian pictures in the left at the wall.

01:53.253 --> 01:58.041
Since we're behind, we're going to show those locations to see us, but we have a structure.

02:05.260 --> 02:05.721
Wow.

02:09.585 --> 02:18.916
Do you mind if I take a few photos?

02:21.419 --> 02:28.787
Excuse me, they don't.

02:35.939 --> 02:38.783
I love these shells.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.908
Just wonderful.

02:44.873 --> 02:51.183
Yeah, this is great.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.288
It's wonderful.

02:54.468 --> 03:01.199
I don't really care to move them much.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.481
I'm sorry.

03:02.601 --> 03:03.803
I'm sorry.

03:11.782 --> 03:16.006
And these are accordions?

03:16.026 --> 03:16.706
Yes, yes.

03:16.787 --> 03:18.768
Yes, we have the accordions.

03:18.848 --> 03:36.945
Of course, these are the larger ones, so they're, um... So, if I was... This is health.

03:37.405 --> 03:39.527
Health is around there, yes.

03:40.216 --> 03:42.859
But it could help, you know, it just moves from this.

03:42.879 --> 03:55.873
Health, health, medicine and sanitary engineering, health resort, heat, herbs and herbal, hereditary, hockey, home, hops, horse, horseshoeing.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.597
And some of these are very small indeed.

03:59.677 --> 04:04.722
Human sacrifice.

04:05.765 --> 04:12.855
But a lot of these subjects, hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, are things we don't cover, and didn't really reckon to cover in those days.

04:14.517 --> 04:22.809
Hypnotism and hysteria, I think probably still have a following, as do immigration, inferiorism, and industries.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.134
I think this is your book.

04:26.254 --> 04:33.544
That's our standard book page, which was designed by Reynolds Stone in the early 50s.

04:33.811 --> 04:36.856
and remain sort of timeless and definite.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.840
Do you remove dust jackets from the book?

04:39.860 --> 04:41.363
Do you describe them, or less, I guess?

04:41.783 --> 04:42.164
We do.

04:42.204 --> 04:56.366
There are several places collecting them, usually from the copyright libraries, the deposit libraries, which keep them in different ways.

04:57.387 --> 05:02.535
Signed works of Scottish artists, I think, are kept by the National Knights of Scotland, but not others.

05:03.292 --> 05:14.449
But the important thing is to be able to display our very distinctive labels, so that otherwise these get onto people's shelves.

05:14.690 --> 05:25.907
Even if they work at home on a dining table, there's family Christmas dinner, it means the table has to be cleared.

05:26.697 --> 05:29.902
They get on the shelves there, and that's sort of a simulation.

05:30.543 --> 05:33.507
To remind people that it's not the impossible.

05:33.527 --> 05:34.869
That's right.

05:36.612 --> 05:50.673
Well, the Library of Congress, I was astonished until then, just removes dust jackets immediately, which is kind of surprising that the National Deposit Library would not be a full example of the text.

05:54.759 --> 05:56.181
Would it be impactful for us?

05:56.701 --> 05:59.465
Yes, indeed, yes.

05:59.745 --> 06:19.474
I love the pink scheme, very nice.

06:19.955 --> 06:25.763
Yes, yes, that was well thought out, well reasonable.

06:26.030 --> 06:26.873
No photographs.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.459
Yeah, I understand.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.347
Otherwise, everybody would want to know.

06:30.387 --> 06:33.981
Plus, I don't want any people who are recognizable either.

06:53.350 --> 07:21.433
very much family stock dictionaries as I could be good as the reference books and the surroundings that have had the 19th century furniture and much of it is in very very full condition so we've been gradually refurbishing there

07:22.578 --> 07:34.410
The old lighting system with those new enterprises wore out and we took advantage of it putting in low energy.

07:35.572 --> 07:50.307
A lot of people haven't realized that that isn't original.

07:51.856 --> 08:03.689
Well, you know, we get only the Times, and we get one to find, and we keep a month's time there.

08:04.770 --> 08:14.821
And because of the CD-ROM, we get the Telegraph as well, and also the Times on CD-ROM.

08:14.961 --> 08:21.728
It's got there for about ten years now, and there are several other things, Hansard, the Congressional Record,

08:22.180 --> 08:41.029
is now taken only on compact disc.

08:41.049 --> 08:50.444
And it's no inconvenience to research with anybody interested in modern part of military documentation can use a corporate machinery.

08:50.464 --> 08:50.584
And...

08:53.078 --> 08:55.863
There's nothing here.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.590
This room is fully wider.

09:00.752 --> 09:10.530
We've got our... We've got our...

09:10.510 --> 09:33.545
Yes, it was extended on the stage.

09:33.565 --> 09:34.687
The original came to where there was that film, I think.

09:34.707 --> 09:35.929
And then there was more in that direction, and above as well.

09:35.949 --> 09:36.390
Yes, they don't match.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.311
I'm going to put it together with these also.

09:41.965 --> 09:58.179
But we were in our own catalogue with a fairly wide range, a widening range of CDs.

09:58.199 --> 09:58.740
Online access to resources.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.822
Very difficult to know how to charge people for that.

10:00.308 --> 10:20.781
and only a small minority of them would want to use advanced IT images, and are not efficient, and I think at present we know they can print off as much as they like with various kinds of trainings, etc.

10:23.107 --> 10:46.577
It's a nice room.

10:46.597 --> 10:47.959
When it first opened, people found it was totally fine, and came in.

10:47.979 --> 10:48.640
The silence was even more silent.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.142
And I don't know why these people come here in some typewriters, you know.

10:50.162 --> 10:50.682
There's plenty of context.

10:50.702 --> 10:52.204
I had to explain that this was the... This was actually in the Rumpus Room.

10:52.224 --> 10:52.725
This was the Rumpus Room.

10:53.009 --> 11:09.794
No, it doesn't, it's just the North Reading Room.

11:09.814 --> 11:10.595
And then this is the Reading Room here.

11:10.615 --> 11:11.657
There's one gentleman in the corner that looks like.

11:11.677 --> 11:11.777
Okay.

11:34.454 --> 11:50.320
What I was saying about us being the largest but the youngest of you.

12:06.753 --> 12:09.056
It is.

12:10.078 --> 12:10.499
It is.

12:10.739 --> 12:28.886
It is now because when I first started, I spent a great deal of time on the building itself, and we've reached in the last six months got a facilities manager, and we deal with all the house administration.

12:29.407 --> 12:32.592
It's everything from

12:34.951 --> 12:50.648
the porter's uniforms and certain um weekly duty vouchers to whether we should repair or replace the lift so the main elevator is um

12:50.864 --> 13:02.721
and we've actually got some very capable of taking decisions on that, or advice on what decisions can be taken.

13:02.942 --> 13:04.003
So... So you don't have a good love with it.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.848
It's busy here on a Monday morning.

13:06.868 --> 13:09.351
Oh, this is a fairly low period, but it is busy.

13:09.512 --> 13:12.155
It's a well-used life.

13:12.216 --> 13:13.998
Yes, it is.

13:15.380 --> 13:20.027
We are heavily used, I think, to go about the...

13:20.648 --> 13:24.894
...the condition is mine.

13:24.914 --> 13:39.015
...the condition is mine.

13:39.035 --> 13:43.602
...the condition is mine.

13:49.302 --> 13:53.268
This is not the Athenaeum.

13:53.348 --> 14:00.738
Yes, and there's Carlisle.

14:00.758 --> 14:19.225
He's a bit more close to genius now, because when we first came, he was still very dirty, and with the... With the bicentenary of his verse coming up,

14:20.217 --> 14:26.404
two or three years ago, we were able to get him cleaned and repaired.

14:26.444 --> 14:29.768
There had been bomb damage during the war.

14:30.409 --> 14:36.456
Part of the reverse of his jacket had come off.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.179
So we had it redone in fiberglass.

14:39.219 --> 14:40.100
You can't tell the difference.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.622
How much bomb damage was there here?

14:42.343 --> 14:48.250
There was an incendiary bomb fell on one particular section.

14:49.512 --> 14:52.836
and philosophy, because it went through a roof.

14:54.678 --> 14:57.701
And this particular section was very much damaged.

14:58.762 --> 15:01.966
It didn't have the art books in it at the time.

15:02.907 --> 15:06.431
It was part of the 1930s extension.

15:06.471 --> 15:07.332
It had to be rebuilt.

15:07.692 --> 15:10.055
But there were lots of collections.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.716
Yes, and we're still filling them.

15:11.736 --> 15:19.485
I brought a colleague who has an encyclopedic memory, and who

15:20.562 --> 15:33.720
He's still producing, every now and again, sets of Luther's works or something like that which we've never had since the bomb.

15:33.980 --> 15:38.146
And he's immensely knowledgeable.

15:38.226 --> 15:44.455
He worked here all his life and just knows what's missing and what needs reflating.

15:45.196 --> 15:48.460
He's amazing because he can go around book fairs

15:48.946 --> 15:54.691
Although he's got a computerized list, he never seems to look at it much.

15:54.711 --> 16:01.938
He wouldn't come back with those white plastic bags they have at book fairs, and they never buy the duplicate books.

16:01.958 --> 16:02.818
How old is this fellow?

16:03.539 --> 16:05.301
Oh, he'll be about 45.

16:05.461 --> 16:06.201
Oh, he's young.

16:06.342 --> 16:13.288
So what did he get is consulted lists of materials that were lost?

16:13.328 --> 16:13.548
Yes.

16:13.568 --> 16:15.930
But it's unreturned books.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.092
What do I call them?

16:18.629 --> 16:24.075
misdemeanors of various kinds, felonious lots.

16:24.596 --> 16:25.236
I suspect that's felonies.

16:25.256 --> 16:33.265
Felonies have been worse, and that's one reason why we've now got a monitored entrance.

16:33.585 --> 16:39.372
That's the, and people have to show their cards before they get in.

16:39.592 --> 16:47.961
We had two sets of sets, one of colour plate books, whole books, and then one of plate slicer who came in.

16:48.194 --> 16:49.075
in my time.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.057
The other one was just before my time, I believe.

16:51.958 --> 17:04.250
And it was the first thing I discovered when I got here, that these frightful thefts had taken place, and we're still sorting it out after the second one.

17:05.211 --> 17:10.837
It was a man who had stolen a great many colour plates from the British Library as well.

17:11.777 --> 17:16.362
It was some sort of rye consolation to us, but he had

17:17.540 --> 17:30.298
They, with much more sophisticated invigilation and much more sophisticated admission procedures, he got in there as well.

17:30.338 --> 17:33.583
I mean, he took a lot of our ghouls there to Great Britain.

17:33.723 --> 17:39.972
But he was taking Thornton's Temple of the British Flora from that.

17:40.052 --> 17:45.960
Although this was in their rare books, the amazing thing was these children

17:46.261 --> 17:53.252
and David Roberts' holding hand, for example, which is printed on sort of a card all over, and it's brittle.

17:53.692 --> 17:58.039
He managed to get these out intact.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.642
You couldn't roll them, you could only fold them.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.888
I think they were putting them in black, loose trousers and things like this.

18:04.489 --> 18:06.732
How did they capture this fellow?

18:06.913 --> 18:09.737
They got him on tape at the British Library.

18:10.477 --> 18:17.128
Where he was sitting, he'd found the one place in the North Library, a gallery, behind a pillar.

18:17.649 --> 18:19.493
So he was half disguised from him.

18:20.354 --> 18:29.189
And then there was a tip-off from the British Library, just going around, a private front.

18:29.209 --> 18:33.717
And that we found, yeah.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.323
No, he wasn't.

18:38.664 --> 18:40.587
How did he get in?

18:40.847 --> 18:42.870
He joined.

18:43.011 --> 18:48.660
He was apparently respectable for me in that way.

18:50.022 --> 18:52.065
We've altered our admissions a bit.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.590
And since then... It's hard to read it.

18:56.332 --> 18:59.056
It is, yes, because he was knowledgeable about it.

18:59.076 --> 19:02.421
He had to be, because he knew exactly what he wanted.

19:02.468 --> 19:03.869
Look at the fellow at the Vatican.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.592
I mean, the scholar from Columbus, Ohio.

19:07.133 --> 19:07.213
Yes.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.175
Poor Father Royal, honey.

19:09.195 --> 19:10.156
Yes.

19:10.176 --> 19:14.520
Well, you know, we are always vulnerable.

19:14.840 --> 19:22.968
And it meant that more of our books are going to be readable only under supervision.

19:22.989 --> 19:25.651
We've got a special desk in our cataloging room.

19:25.671 --> 19:27.593
We've only got one person in the reading room.

19:27.613 --> 19:31.497
We don't have as a rare books room, you see, which would mean, you know,

19:32.253 --> 19:48.210
It's much more spacious than I expected, I have to say.

19:48.230 --> 19:55.138
I'm used to going into the drum rooms in the Athenaeum.

19:57.700 --> 20:20.907
A little bit of everything, actually.

20:24.987 --> 20:41.612
uh-huh

20:41.896 --> 20:45.122
the key words, I know, this retrospective conversion.

20:45.242 --> 20:55.602
We've been computerized since 1984 and then went on screen about five years ago.

20:55.622 --> 21:01.052
Before then, the catalogue was

21:01.505 --> 21:05.236
accumulated and printed off every six months.

21:05.397 --> 21:13.641
It looked like books and people didn't realise quite what had happened.

21:14.954 --> 21:20.182
84 to nearly 15 years, well over 12 years.

21:21.103 --> 21:25.429
And it accounts for over a third of our issues.

21:26.491 --> 21:32.800
So our most recent literature is most in demand.

21:32.820 --> 21:38.208
This capital here goes from 1950 to 1984.

21:39.070 --> 21:41.333
And...

21:42.359 --> 21:47.406
We'll be covering well over a half of the book.

21:47.466 --> 21:48.528
Are you going to keep this?

21:48.688 --> 21:49.469
No.

21:49.970 --> 21:54.677
I don't want to get into one of those Nicholson Baker discussions.

21:54.817 --> 21:56.459
That's fine.

21:57.301 --> 22:01.847
When that article came out, I was sent... I mean, it was a huge lot.

22:01.967 --> 22:02.829
I've interviewed him.

22:02.849 --> 22:03.189
Yes, I knew.

22:03.229 --> 22:07.936
We were sent something like six copies of it from different members.

22:07.996 --> 22:10.780
We get to New York, but in any case, you may be interested

22:11.080 --> 22:15.565
The only gain of this was the Xerox Corporation, I think.

22:17.547 --> 22:35.147
Yes, but it was threaded through with the usual New Yorker cartoons, the usual businessmen jumping off roofs, or shrinks with their certificates on the wall.

22:35.701 --> 22:39.625
It went on and on and on, and we had many copies of it.

22:39.645 --> 22:44.271
But the distinction here is that for the Americans, we've got nothing on the back.

22:45.893 --> 22:48.996
We've got none of those traces that have been lost.

22:49.016 --> 22:55.023
So something simple like that, the only quality we've got is a measurement.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.766
We haven't even got a publisher today, etc.

22:57.786 --> 23:00.409
It's very much a short term.

23:00.575 --> 23:05.341
I don't see much artifactual value to them, actually.

23:05.361 --> 23:06.943
There isn't.

23:06.963 --> 23:08.345
There isn't.

23:08.365 --> 23:26.008
And so, when these have been fully catalogued, using other external information, other databases, particularly of a consortium of university and research libraries we are affiliated to, called CURL, the main British,

23:26.478 --> 23:32.066
lives Oxford, Cambridge, etc., and Manchester for representing universities.

23:32.086 --> 23:46.467
With that, it means that we're going to have much fuller information on our screens, much easier to search, doing word searches, etc., and it's going to be a great improvement.

23:46.487 --> 23:51.675
We still have a few members who have not accommodated themselves to the new environment.

23:52.482 --> 23:56.448
This newfangled system means that I don't hold with that sort of thing.

23:57.429 --> 24:12.710
And they're the losers because they can quite easily just use the shelves without realizing what stock we have, what we have in stock but might be on loan, which is much wider.

24:13.872 --> 24:15.795
I love how big it is.

24:15.815 --> 24:17.477
Yes, well, it's...

24:19.027 --> 24:23.333
Thank you.
