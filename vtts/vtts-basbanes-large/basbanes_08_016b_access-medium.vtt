00:01.904 --> 00:06.250
You know, I haven't bothered you on that, because that's my job, as you know.

00:06.270 --> 00:06.631
All right.

00:06.651 --> 00:07.592
For whom are you writing?

00:07.893 --> 00:13.161
Well, anyway, so we'll just ask you a few more questions, and I'll be on my way.

00:13.201 --> 00:23.836
When you're doing a biography like this, does the subject, I know it's almost a cliche question, but does he come alive for you?

00:23.856 --> 00:27.642
He comes so much alive that I was haunted in my dreams.

00:28.094 --> 00:40.745
and kept waking up in the night, I was still writing, and Lincoln right there in my dreams, not approving or approving or saying, this isn't the way it was, and arguing with me in my dreams.

00:40.765 --> 00:45.189
It would probably be a nightmare, but not once, but repeatedly, over and over again.

00:45.229 --> 00:51.414
You're so absorbed in this whole business that you can't pull out and say, oh, well, that's just a job I do from nine to five.

00:51.434 --> 00:52.555
You do it all the time.

00:53.016 --> 00:58.000
I have a great, this is a good quote for you,

00:58.334 --> 01:02.182
You said at the beginning you worked it by his side, at his shoulder.

01:02.202 --> 01:05.369
I think what you're telling me now is the point where he was at your shoulder.

01:05.629 --> 01:07.554
Well, I would like to think so.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.382
And it does become flesh and blood for you.

01:11.863 --> 01:12.183
Oh, yes.

01:12.203 --> 01:14.308
And do you go and do you visit any of the sites?

01:14.969 --> 01:17.254
I know just a couple weeks ago I was in Washington and I

01:17.673 --> 01:24.099
walked into Ford's Theater and walked across the street.

01:24.259 --> 01:43.897
Well, you know, in some ways, maybe we're going back to one of the very earliest questions, one of the perhaps precipitating things in deciding to do this, my wife, Aida, and I were down in Washington and we went again to the Lincoln Memorial.

01:43.917 --> 01:47.680
Now, I've been there so many times that I fear that any

01:47.930 --> 01:50.093
Okay, that's the Lincoln Memorial.

01:50.834 --> 01:58.405
She had not been there, not been there in years at any rate, and therefore went much more closely over it than I had.

01:59.306 --> 02:06.837
And she pointed to the second in audio, which is on the right hand side, his left hand side, your right hand side as you come in.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.921
And I never realized

02:10.120 --> 02:21.138
That sentence was there, that this war can go on until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid for in blood drawn by the sword.

02:21.578 --> 02:23.361
That's a terrible thought.

02:24.343 --> 02:35.841
Can you imagine any president saying, until all the injustice that occurred in whatever war Bosnia has been repaid in blood, this war has to go on forever?

02:36.395 --> 02:37.817
What did he mean by that?

02:37.877 --> 02:39.459
Why did he say things like that?

02:39.540 --> 02:41.222
It was a horrible thing, she said.

02:42.504 --> 02:52.278
Well, I came only thinking about, you know, the words had been rolling in my mind so long that they sort of got smooth, the way pebbles do in those machines, like smooth pebbles.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.441
And I began thinking, those are very harsh words.

02:55.162 --> 02:57.546
And what I... So you agreed with her?

02:57.566 --> 03:02.213
I came to agree with her, and then I got to thinking, okay, what was it that he was trying to say?

03:02.273 --> 03:05.237
Why did he say it this way?

03:06.162 --> 03:16.632
He could have said that he believed in predestination, that God will, that this war is going on, that he will go on to a certain time.

03:17.493 --> 03:27.402
He never used, and I had a computer search, I have all of Lincoln's works on my computer, I searched through, he never used the word predestination.

03:27.422 --> 03:29.024
What was it he was trying to say?

03:29.544 --> 03:34.549
Well, he was invoking an old Protestant doctrine which

03:34.715 --> 03:47.392
All Baptists, all Presbyterians, all Calvinists in general had drummed into the American society over and over again the doctrine of exact retribution.

03:48.093 --> 03:57.866
Namely, an infringement of the Lord's law has to be paid for in exactly the same measure that the offense itself.

03:57.886 --> 04:00.570
A heavy offense against the law has to have a heavy punishment.

04:02.002 --> 04:10.555
This doctrine of exact retribution was something that Lincoln's audience could understand, could empathize with, could vibrate with.

04:10.675 --> 04:19.488
If he had said, which would have been more characteristic of him, say, the doctrine of necessity says the war has to go on, people wouldn't know.

04:19.508 --> 04:26.278
If he had said predestination, that involved theological concepts, he was not prepared to try to make it.

04:26.298 --> 04:27.840
But if you talk about retribution,

04:28.360 --> 04:32.164
Instantly, there's a bell that rings in millions of Americans' minds.

04:32.724 --> 04:35.867
Ah, we know what he's talking about.

04:35.887 --> 04:56.207
We have offended against the law, not merely the South, but we in the North and the South have offended against the Lord in the heavy fashion of having slaves in this country and exploiting them for 250 years, and there has to be any exact payment on the other side of the scale, and that is what we're seeing, and that's why the war goes on so.

04:56.609 --> 05:00.954
Ah, now we understand why the war goes on and what's going to happen at the beginning.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.476
And do you, in your mind, rank him as a president?

05:03.496 --> 05:07.420
Oh, I think he's the greatest of all.

05:07.881 --> 05:10.183
And did you feel this going into the study?

05:10.203 --> 05:12.025
No, I didn't, really.

05:12.766 --> 05:15.369
That is, I had no special thought.

05:15.429 --> 05:19.913
I would have ranked him among the top American presidents.

05:20.614 --> 05:24.338
When I started, perhaps my favorite would have been Thomas Jefferson.

05:25.010 --> 05:32.121
not for his presidential years, but simply because he was such a wonderful man and ranged all over the universe.

05:32.141 --> 05:49.887
But the more I've studied Lincoln, the more I've followed his thought processes, the more I've come to understand how he made decisions and why he made them when he did, the more convinced I am that he understood leadership better than any other American president.

05:51.875 --> 05:52.916
It's kind of odd.

05:52.996 --> 05:56.900
I didn't start this book out as a study in leadership.

05:56.920 --> 06:04.027
It turns out, now that it's finished, that there are programs and courses all over the country studying leadership.

06:04.047 --> 06:05.028
It's the hot thing.

06:05.828 --> 06:07.290
I didn't know this when I started.

06:07.310 --> 06:09.392
I didn't write it for that purpose.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.854
But I do think it is a study in leadership.

06:11.874 --> 06:18.120
And how do you judge his interests?

06:18.140 --> 06:20.262
One can't make one categorical

06:20.680 --> 06:22.262
statement about that.

06:22.282 --> 06:30.473
He was not a wide-ranging intellect in that he had, as far as I can tell, no interest in art, literature.

06:30.813 --> 06:31.574
He loved Shakespeare.

06:31.734 --> 06:37.642
He loved Shakespeare, but in fiction, he started one novel once and put it down.

06:37.702 --> 06:41.127
He had a paragraph.

06:42.408 --> 06:43.790
He was not widely traveled.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.316
He had limited range of acquaintances.

06:48.396 --> 06:49.017
He was not

06:49.672 --> 06:59.721
He just knows a polished social person of social graces, though he could be a practically charming host.

07:02.844 --> 07:11.771
I do not think that he had a theoretical mind that he was interested in abstract ideas ever, particularly.

07:11.791 --> 07:19.358
But having made all those disclaimers, one is left with a particular kind of mind that deals with reality as it is.

07:19.743 --> 07:44.389
that deals with it on a point-by-point basis, an ad hoc basis, and has a degree of flexibility that allows you to shift with circumstances and to say, okay, if plan A doesn't work, there's plan B, but if plan B doesn't work, there's plan C. This kind of flexibility, I think, gave Lincoln many of his most enduring and endearing qualities.

07:45.390 --> 07:48.113
One starts off, perhaps,

07:48.734 --> 07:53.500
in Lincoln scholarship, but a certain kind of frustration with Lincoln.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.446
Why in heaven's name did he put up with the incompetent generals?

07:57.466 --> 08:02.632
Well, let George Lee McClellan hang around all those years to eat after the feed and get him in nowhere.

08:03.614 --> 08:17.492
Well, it's partly because of a degree of tolerance that Lincoln encouraged with this flexibility, a feeling of, okay, McClellan's first plan didn't work, let's try plan B, let's try plan C, just plan D.

08:17.793 --> 08:19.014
Let's let him give a chance.

08:19.835 --> 08:28.184
He was tolerant of subordinates, he was tolerant of failure, perhaps because he had a lot of failure in his own life.

08:28.204 --> 08:36.333
He almost never made rash or precipitous decisions, so he'd get very angry, but he didn't make rash decisions on the basis of his anger.

08:36.954 --> 08:41.459
These are to be the qualities of a great man and a very great leader.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.360
It seems to be yours.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.905
Now you said that you had one more big look at you.

08:47.189 --> 08:50.452
You don't know how to do that?

08:50.472 --> 08:52.093
I don't know, I hope.

08:52.113 --> 08:52.554
No.

08:52.614 --> 08:54.395
Look at all the resources you have here.

08:54.736 --> 08:55.336
You have to.

08:55.356 --> 08:57.558
I don't know what I would do.

08:57.778 --> 08:59.800
Look, I can see Barry Chestnut Civil War.

09:01.341 --> 09:01.602
Sure you can.

09:01.622 --> 09:04.044
That whole upper tier is biography.

09:04.905 --> 09:05.325
I don't know.

09:05.705 --> 09:09.148
It's hard for me to think that it'll ever come a day that I don't write.

09:10.169 --> 09:12.591
It'll be sort of like not reading.

09:12.611 --> 09:13.452
So what will I do?

09:13.832 --> 09:16.875
One possibility is that

09:17.243 --> 09:21.450
In a few years, perhaps I will have some more essays.

09:21.470 --> 09:27.099
Lincoln Reconsidered has done very well over the years, and people might be interested in another book like that.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.684
But in the other hand, maybe it's time to do something different.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.868
Maybe I will write a mystery story.

09:32.888 --> 09:34.270
I love mystery stories.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.293
Would you like to write a mystery story?

09:36.313 --> 09:38.076
I'd love to write a mystery story.

09:38.136 --> 09:39.338
Do you have an idea for a plot?

09:39.358 --> 09:44.466
I would love to write a mystery story in historical times.

09:44.699 --> 09:49.144
You want to capitalize on what I have some ideas.

09:49.164 --> 09:51.627
Do you have an idea for a hero or character?

09:51.647 --> 09:53.068
I'm not born upon now.

09:53.088 --> 09:57.493
Or I might write a memoir.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.536
I'd like to see a mystery story, too, though.

09:59.596 --> 10:01.998
Don't give up on that.

10:02.099 --> 10:07.184
I don't know what I... One final question, because I know you have some help coming in.

10:07.204 --> 10:11.449
But you are, by temperament, a historian or a biographer?

10:11.598 --> 10:15.982
I mean, your great prizes and awards is for biography.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.383
It's just interesting, isn't it?

10:17.863 --> 10:22.167
Well, this is a problem of self-identification.

10:22.868 --> 10:33.477
And as I said, you know, really up until the Thomas Wolfe was published, I'd always thought I'm a historian who just happened every now and then to write about particular individuals.

10:33.497 --> 10:40.103
And then when people, quite a lot of people, began

10:40.859 --> 10:48.149
to like the Thomas Moore book, and they say, this is the way we want to do biography, this is the way we type biography.

10:48.169 --> 11:00.004
I began thinking, you know, maybe I'm not much of a historian anyway, maybe I really have all along been a kind of biographer monquet, working in the historian's field.

11:00.044 --> 11:02.207
Maybe there's not that much difference.

11:02.227 --> 11:03.829
And which mystery writers do you read?

11:04.450 --> 11:05.371
I read all.

11:06.072 --> 11:08.895
I love all these historians.

11:08.915 --> 11:09.855
I feel them.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.077
I read them every night.

11:11.397 --> 11:16.462
It puts my mind in neutral.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.466
I love the classical ones.

11:20.486 --> 11:24.871
I can read over and over again.

11:25.291 --> 11:32.078
I can watch or read Sherlock Holmes over and over again.

11:32.412 --> 11:40.459
I don't really like, perhaps, some of the more recent hard-boiled mysteries that seem to be primarily violence for violence.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.785
I like mystery stories that have a plot and detection that a lot of... E.G.

11:46.805 --> 11:50.007
James must be a... Yes, that's exactly right.

11:50.027 --> 11:54.672
And my reason for sort of thinking on that, it doesn't mean that I do like mystery stories.

11:55.552 --> 11:56.954
Everybody does, almost.

11:57.874 --> 12:02.098
But in some ways, the historian's task is like that of the detective.

12:02.534 --> 12:04.557
That is, you work yourself around him.

12:04.658 --> 12:07.322
What is it that could have done this?

12:07.903 --> 12:09.967
Why did he do this at this time?

12:10.247 --> 12:12.110
Who's responsible for doing that?

12:12.771 --> 12:15.616
And this really is a detective question.

12:15.636 --> 12:22.147
I think you've given me my lead, and I'm going to... See, this one's for me.

12:22.207 --> 12:25.092
I already put the plastic on it to save it.

12:25.693 --> 12:26.635
Now, how should...
