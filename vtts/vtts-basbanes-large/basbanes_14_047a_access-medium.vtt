WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:06.145
Well, this is your first novel in five years?

00:07.868 --> 00:08.269
It is, indeed.

00:08.749 --> 00:14.118
How does it feel to be, I guess, with the last work, you completed a trilogy?

00:14.659 --> 00:15.841
I completed a trilogy, yeah.

00:16.061 --> 00:17.223
And this is a standalone?

00:17.243 --> 00:19.126
This is a one-off, yeah.

00:19.146 --> 00:28.941
Perhaps we could talk about the impulse to do a book, a social commentary novel, it appears.

00:30.237 --> 00:32.699
Is it a millennial kind of a thing, would you say?

00:34.321 --> 00:35.843
I suppose everything is.

00:36.223 --> 00:38.465
You could feel it peeping upon us.

00:38.926 --> 00:52.720
I think it was really, because I hadn't written any fiction for five years because of working on something else, I think it was just a desire to sort of comment on things that had been happening while I wasn't looking and just get it all down.

00:54.041 --> 01:00.227
You know, it's a slight feeling of fin de siècle, you know, this is the end of something and what comes next.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.744
There certainly is humour in here, but is there anger as well?

01:06.947 --> 01:10.410
There is anger, but it's not very personal anger.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.252
It's quite detached anger.

01:12.292 --> 01:21.162
I mean, I sort of feel, I don't feel personally very angry about things, but I feel angry on behalf of certain things that I've seen happening.

01:22.063 --> 01:26.147
But of course, when I read this book, we were at the very

01:26.566 --> 01:29.389
long, slow end of the Tory government.

01:29.810 --> 01:34.296
So Britain has changed a bit since I wrote it.

01:34.896 --> 01:43.707
So I was quite angry about quite a lot of things that were going on.

01:43.727 --> 01:55.662
I wonder, because you've written in so many different forms, would it ever occur you to respond to social events in non-fiction, in essays?

01:55.844 --> 02:01.229
Why is it that the novel seems most appropriate for you to respond to these developments?

02:01.249 --> 02:03.611
Well, that's a very good question, and I don't know the answer.

02:04.672 --> 02:11.478
I mean, I think that I enjoy writing fiction when it's going well, and it's a natural form to me.

02:11.798 --> 02:22.528
I do do a bit of journalism in the UK, but I suppose I take a slightly longer perspective than daily journalism.

02:23.349 --> 02:25.851
I find it very hard to respond to instant events

02:26.945 --> 02:28.386
instantly.

02:28.947 --> 02:32.910
So it's a bit of a longer season than that.

02:34.071 --> 02:41.197
But I've often wondered why I've never thought of being more actively involved in politics.

02:41.217 --> 02:48.283
And I think that, again, is something to do with the novelist distance, which is quite an ironic distance, really.

02:49.925 --> 02:55.389
Is it coincidental that the witch of the title is a feminist critic?

02:55.469 --> 02:56.310
I know that you've

02:56.763 --> 03:04.555
You commented before, one of your earlier novels, I believe it was Waterfall, was the most female of your books.

03:04.755 --> 03:05.857
Yes, yes.

03:05.877 --> 03:09.883
And Middle Ground was a response to the feminist critics.

03:10.404 --> 03:12.927
Yes, yes, that's true.

03:13.028 --> 03:19.297
Well, feminism has been very much a feature of the landscape of my entire writing life.

03:19.978 --> 03:24.525
When I started writing in the 60s, feminism was going new.

03:24.742 --> 03:25.403
Certainly in England.

03:25.423 --> 03:30.567
I mean, there have been a few months of Beauvoir in France, but there really was very little happening in England.

03:31.308 --> 03:35.292
And so it's been there all the time.

03:35.952 --> 03:45.661
And it's only gradually that you realise how different French feminism, English feminism, American feminism, how different all these manifestations are.

03:46.181 --> 03:54.529
And I think in the middle ground, I was a little fed up with some commercial brands of American feminism.

03:55.741 --> 04:12.495
which were a very aggressive kind of hyped-up, self-promoting kind of feminism, which was not what the feminist movement I'd been brought up with seemed to be about.

04:12.535 --> 04:24.786
And I suppose in The Witch of Exmoor, she is fed up with the slowness of change, and I think that's what a lot of people feel as they get older, that those thought things would move along a bit.

04:25.205 --> 04:32.011
And then you begin to think, well, they haven't actually moved anywhere, and something, you know, doing one's best for years, and nothing happens at all.

04:32.731 --> 04:36.535
That's not quite true within feminism, but it's to another point.

04:36.635 --> 04:38.676
But your response is to totally withdraw.

04:38.777 --> 04:39.357
Yes, it is.

04:39.397 --> 04:41.859
Well, one sees people do that.

04:41.879 --> 04:54.570
And I have occasionally a deep impulse myself, which I never would follow, I don't think, but just a deep impulse to say to hell with all of you and go away and mind my own business.

04:54.702 --> 05:00.149
But I think a lot of older people... I mean, I'm not as old as Frida, but she's not very old either.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.090
She's only in her 60s.

05:01.110 --> 05:03.754
I mean, she's quite young by modern standards.

05:03.774 --> 05:09.080
But I think a whole lot of people have a kind of temptation to go and do that.

05:09.100 --> 05:09.962
Chuck it all.

05:09.982 --> 05:11.463
Yeah, Chuck it all is that.

05:11.884 --> 05:12.905
Enough of all that.

05:13.206 --> 05:20.435
Of course, that opening sequence there was... That film must be a play, couldn't it?

05:20.455 --> 05:20.855
Yeah, yeah.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.077
And you have done drama.

05:22.732 --> 05:25.034
Would something like this work, do you think, as a play?

05:26.555 --> 05:29.077
I have given up even trying to write drama.

05:31.119 --> 05:31.820
I can't do it.

05:32.280 --> 05:44.330
I think it's a very tight format, and I'm not very good at... Actually, having said that, I have got a play in my head at the moment, and I'm quite interested in having a go at it one day.

05:44.350 --> 05:52.637
I have this one brilliant idea, because you know the problem is that there are no parts for actresses and no parts for aging women.

05:52.820 --> 05:59.468
And I was just talking to some friends last summer, and suddenly I thought, oh, that would make a wonderful play.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.230
I won't tell you what it is, because I'll probably never do it.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.532
But I might one day have another go.

06:03.793 --> 06:06.736
But the novel is a more natural form to me.

06:06.776 --> 06:09.099
It's something I've grown up with, and it's a natural form.

06:09.159 --> 06:10.601
Do you see it visually?

06:10.621 --> 06:12.323
I always see it visually.

06:12.343 --> 06:14.385
I always see everything visually.

06:15.146 --> 06:18.510
But I don't see them in terms of confined to the stage.

06:18.570 --> 06:19.952
I see a lot of landscape.

06:20.032 --> 06:21.173
I see a lot of...

06:21.490 --> 06:22.691
a lot of landscape.

06:22.752 --> 06:25.875
I mean, I would find it hard to do without the landscape.

06:25.895 --> 06:30.461
I mean, this gathering is really a perfect... Yes, it would.

06:30.601 --> 06:38.451
This gathering of characters is almost a set piece, isn't it?

06:38.471 --> 06:38.951
That's true.

06:39.011 --> 06:48.383
I do see that as an opening sequence, perhaps even as a television sort of drama, in which you can have more landscape.

06:49.184 --> 06:51.126
Do you agree with some of the reviewers that

06:51.545 --> 06:54.028
that a number of these characters have caricatures?

06:54.088 --> 06:55.870
Is that part of the...?

06:57.231 --> 07:04.559
Um, yes, I haven't... I don't really read the news very much, but I mean, they are intended as caricatures.

07:04.639 --> 07:07.002
I mean, it's not a very realistic novel.

07:07.142 --> 07:10.345
It's a more of a sort of stable novel than a realistic novel.

07:10.365 --> 07:11.727
I wish some of the critics would get that.

07:12.548 --> 07:16.472
I know, people read very badly, I'm not trying to... People read very...

07:17.060 --> 07:19.042
People read very prosaically.

07:19.062 --> 07:20.544
They expect everything to be real.

07:20.685 --> 07:24.109
And the point of a satire is that it satirizes, I think.

07:24.149 --> 07:25.631
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:25.951 --> 07:34.982
But they do expect, because the surface is reasonably realistic, they expect it to be real and individualized.

07:35.103 --> 07:42.492
And in fact, one of the points of it is that people are tight, and they fall into typical processes.

07:42.512 --> 07:45.936
And it hinders the whole process of

07:46.574 --> 07:49.018
developing a character fully, shall we say.

07:49.298 --> 07:51.962
A character does exist in a satire.

07:52.523 --> 07:55.808
It's a specific purpose.

07:55.828 --> 07:56.769
That makes sense to me.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.533
Well, it does to some people, but not to everybody.

07:59.914 --> 08:04.441
It's a question of reader expectations, really, what people are expecting.

08:04.461 --> 08:05.502
Pardon me.

08:05.522 --> 08:07.786
Did you have fun writing this novel?

08:08.046 --> 08:09.248
Yes, I did.

08:09.268 --> 08:15.417
It does seem to have a lot of good humor in it.

08:16.055 --> 08:22.061
Where you've done work in so many different forms, though, did it feel like time for a novel?

08:22.201 --> 08:22.461
I mean, yeah.

08:23.362 --> 08:23.882
It did.

08:25.304 --> 08:31.209
What had happened was that I spent five years working on a biography of Angus Warden.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.951
Did you ever meet Angus?

08:32.971 --> 08:33.532
I never did.

08:33.872 --> 08:40.418
I mean, he was somebody I really very much admired as a writer and as a human being.

08:41.339 --> 08:45.403
But I spent five years working on it, because it's a long time in your life.

08:45.957 --> 08:51.444
When I got to the end of that, I wanted to do something short.

08:51.544 --> 08:55.909
And this novel, although it's not very short, it's shorter than the last one or two I've written.

08:55.929 --> 09:04.360
And I wanted it to be quite light in texture, which is why it's got the title it has and the ending it has.

09:05.421 --> 09:08.004
So my hope was that people wouldn't take it too seriously.

09:08.024 --> 09:09.326
I hope you call it The Witch of Exxon.

09:09.346 --> 09:12.910
They wouldn't think it was a realistic novel, but no, no, they don't seem to get that.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.673
So, yes, I wanted to have fun.

09:15.713 --> 09:19.117
I wanted to write quite a playful novel, really.

09:19.137 --> 09:30.111
After the strain of working on something that finally was rather depressing, because when you write about somebody who's old, then gets ill and then dies... In real life.

09:30.191 --> 09:30.912
In real life.

09:30.972 --> 09:32.093
As opposed to a character.

09:32.213 --> 09:32.494
Exactly.

09:32.514 --> 09:37.520
You feel really... I got really... I got really depressed by that.

09:38.141 --> 09:40.804
And so this book was in a way a reply to that.

09:41.223 --> 09:43.906
and the departure as well.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.267
A sort of getting out of that.

09:46.028 --> 09:56.179
Do you see now, because it is a rather extensive body of work, do you see it as a body of work, a corpus, shall we say?

09:56.839 --> 10:06.910
I see, I do see reactions and developments and myself reacting again to the books before and I can remember how one book led to another which

10:07.885 --> 10:10.168
when you're writing it, you can't quite see it.

10:10.188 --> 10:14.713
But then you look back and you think, well, of course, that's how that moved on from there.

10:14.733 --> 10:15.954
So I do see it.

10:15.974 --> 10:21.860
I mean, I wouldn't use such a grand word, of course.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.022
But it sounds good.

10:23.042 --> 10:24.323
It sounds good.

10:24.343 --> 10:27.206
At my age, I feel I've got a right to it.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.689
It certainly is a body of work.

10:29.789 --> 10:31.791
I did an interview with Nadine Gordomar.

10:33.593 --> 10:37.858
She is of the opinion that everything she does is...

10:37.990 --> 10:44.618
more or less the same work that you compared it to a sculpture that you look at from different angles of vision.

10:47.581 --> 10:48.683
And that is interesting.

10:48.703 --> 10:49.964
That is interesting.

10:49.984 --> 10:55.651
Because I do know that I've had some obsessions and themes that I've followed through.

10:56.312 --> 10:59.435
And every time I begin a book, I think I'm writing something different.

10:59.536 --> 11:02.159
And then I find I'm actually coming back to the same.

11:02.179 --> 11:02.699
Really?

11:02.819 --> 11:06.664
I'm sort of coming back to the same theme, which is it

11:07.066 --> 11:07.907
Inevitable.

11:07.927 --> 11:15.215
It was one always going back to childhood's obsession, things that happened to you when you were very little.

11:15.636 --> 11:18.339
In her case, I imagine, things that happened to her country.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.502
And you just go back again and again.

11:21.042 --> 11:24.346
Would you tinker with things if you had the chance?

11:24.406 --> 11:26.929
Or is completed work in your view completed work?

11:26.949 --> 11:27.850
I wouldn't go back.

11:28.431 --> 11:29.272
I wouldn't go back.

11:30.613 --> 11:31.514
I regret.

11:31.855 --> 11:35.419
I mean, I think some things I didn't do as well as I could have done, and some things

11:36.428 --> 11:38.653
I wouldn't want to have to really read them.

11:38.673 --> 11:40.457
I wouldn't have to like to look at them again.

11:40.998 --> 11:44.325
But I wouldn't want to work on the same book.

11:44.345 --> 11:48.294
I'd rather treat the same subject differently.

11:48.474 --> 11:55.990
Was it Henry James when he was reading the prefaces for the New York condition, you know, went in and started fooling around with...

11:56.392 --> 11:58.835
I think Wordsworth was in it.

11:58.915 --> 12:00.737
Wordsworth was revoked.

12:01.117 --> 12:03.360
It did, and he got worse as he went wrong.

12:03.400 --> 12:08.425
There's a warning in that, because I actually think the only version is better.

12:08.505 --> 12:09.546
It is.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.107
It's a question.

12:10.127 --> 12:12.930
It's one of my favorite questions, because it's amazing.

12:13.971 --> 12:22.721
I know when William Kennedy was given an opportunity to bring out a new edition of The Ink Truck, his first novel, and he said, that really is my first novel.

12:22.741 --> 12:26.365
It is a first novel, and it reads like a first novel.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.397
But he said the temptation wasn't there.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.681
That's who I was at that point.

12:30.701 --> 12:31.221
Yes, exactly.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.925
And you have to say that's who I was and that was.

12:33.945 --> 12:41.435
On the other hand, with somebody like Michael with a biography, now have you seen him over the... You see, that is different.

12:41.495 --> 12:42.797
That's totally different.

12:42.957 --> 12:48.865
Because whole new materials come along and... And you make a few little errors that you want to make right.

12:48.925 --> 12:50.147
Of course, of course.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.769
I had a book published two years ago.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.972
It's still in print, my sixth printing.

12:54.678 --> 13:03.271
Which has given me the opportunity to go in and correct little things that you want to do.

13:03.591 --> 13:05.274
But that's a work of non-fiction.

13:05.294 --> 13:06.375
But that's non-fiction.

13:06.395 --> 13:07.677
It's a completely different thing.

13:07.738 --> 13:13.106
I mean, I think that tampering with your fiction is like sort of, it's like betraying your earlier self.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.608
Yourself.

13:15.048 --> 13:24.162
But with non-fiction, I have to do next year, I have to spend time redoing the Oxford companion to English literature, which is...

13:24.260 --> 13:26.243
A very useful book.

13:26.483 --> 13:30.488
And of course that has to be redone because it's well out of date now.

13:31.049 --> 13:39.520
And of course, as you were saying, every printing, I'm afraid, mistakes have to be corrected every time it reads.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.364
Regardless of how carefully it's written.

13:42.384 --> 13:44.426
And some of them weren't even mistakes at the time.

13:44.446 --> 13:52.697
It's just that new information comes up and you realize that some people lied about their birth defects or all sorts of things come up.

13:53.268 --> 13:57.814
We'll be doing a new edition of my book in 1999, a paperback.

13:57.834 --> 13:58.795
Coming up in 1999?

13:58.955 --> 14:02.900
Well, because I have a new book coming out then, so they want to bring out the paperback then.

14:03.120 --> 14:09.829
And I really want to go in, because new information has come to light.

14:09.869 --> 14:13.714
I had a person who had the secret to him was that he had an alias.

14:14.675 --> 14:18.460
I won't go into great detail, but it was still unresolved questions.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.785
And lo and behold, the great answer to him, which came as a response from a reader,

14:23.137 --> 14:27.702
There's a third alias, and that's the secret to the whole man.

14:29.404 --> 14:30.846
And that came from a reader.

14:30.906 --> 14:45.043
A reader who saw me interviewed on television and called me from Kansas and directed me to a court case several thousand miles away, and there was a deposition that provided the secret to this guy.

14:45.479 --> 14:46.861
Which you've been looking for.

14:47.101 --> 14:51.888
Which I've been looking for all over America, but not in Kansas.

14:51.908 --> 14:53.149
But not in Kansas.

14:53.169 --> 14:55.953
And this person just happened to see you on television.

14:55.993 --> 15:00.479
I was interviewed on Book Notes, a program, a C-SPAN.

15:00.560 --> 15:06.908
And it played once, and it was played again by a popular demand on Christmas week.

15:07.489 --> 15:13.377
And this lawyer, who happened to be looking for football games... Ah, so it wasn't...

15:13.846 --> 15:15.648
That he was looking for your subject?

15:15.708 --> 15:16.329
No, he didn't.

15:16.469 --> 15:17.030
It was random.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.514
He was random, and he heard the name Haven No More come up.

15:20.795 --> 15:21.315
Right.

15:21.335 --> 15:23.398
Which is an anagram for Have No More.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.661
This man called himself Have No More.

15:26.142 --> 15:26.422
Yeah, yeah.

15:26.582 --> 15:33.291
And what I determined what his name is is actually Haven More changed, but the real secret to the guy is that he was Richard More.

15:33.931 --> 15:38.697
His birth name, which would have led me through Freedom of Information Act files.

15:38.737 --> 15:42.402
You just got back through the real... To find everything about him and...

15:42.888 --> 15:44.091
fascinating character.

15:45.153 --> 15:50.785
But anyway, I want to get all of this into the, not all of it, but some of it.

15:51.005 --> 15:53.130
Into the next thing.

15:53.190 --> 15:58.542
People are always asking me, what's the story with this guy Omar?

15:58.602 --> 16:00.326
Did you find out who he really is?

16:00.346 --> 16:02.871
It's very satisfying that a member of

16:02.952 --> 16:04.093
You're sort of public.

16:04.514 --> 16:04.995
It's wonderful.

16:05.135 --> 16:11.563
I mean, it makes one feel really it's a collaborative effort, and the people out there are really, it's exciting.

16:11.583 --> 16:16.289
I think it saved my life, because this guy was threatening me with a $15 million bill.

16:17.750 --> 16:25.180
And claiming that I had factually incorrect things about him, but in fact, it's been quite correct.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.863
It's just that we didn't know about the third alias.

16:28.079 --> 16:39.837
We knew that he had been in the military in 1944 and that he was mustered out within nine months, possibly.

16:40.538 --> 16:43.783
It turns out that he was 15 years old and he lied about his age.

16:44.464 --> 16:48.871
But in his treaty to us, he said, that couldn't possibly be me.

16:48.911 --> 16:50.914
I was only 15 years old in 1944.

16:51.035 --> 16:55.842
Lo and behold, the deposition in Kansas says he ran away from home at the age of 13.

16:56.024 --> 16:58.869
Lied about his age and joined the army at the age of fifteen.

16:59.710 --> 17:00.131
So he was.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.313
Yeah, he was.

17:01.814 --> 17:06.502
So this guy saved me for a great day.

17:07.163 --> 17:09.126
And he was a lawyer, you said, of course, in the contract.

17:09.146 --> 17:10.408
A lawyer for this guy.

17:10.428 --> 17:11.290
Yeah, that's right.

17:11.310 --> 17:15.216
He was somewhat of a breach of—the guy's a sociopath.

17:15.236 --> 17:20.024
But what he did is he used twenty million dollars of another man's money to build a great library.

17:20.044 --> 17:21.627
I wrote a book about bibliomania.

17:21.691 --> 17:29.863
Anyway, we don't want to talk about me, but I'm sorry to go off in this direction.

17:29.883 --> 17:39.136
But I do want to ask you a question, because I'm working on a new book which does embrace this whole concept of book culture and reading in books.

17:40.037 --> 17:46.546
Do you have thoughts on the novel as we approach this?

17:46.566 --> 17:51.293
I have lots of thoughts, and I've been being forced to have lots of thoughts.

17:51.644 --> 18:00.053
Because there are things that have been happening in England, and now you will know the reading of the old British Museum.

18:00.073 --> 18:02.456
It's about support.

18:02.476 --> 18:03.957
That's sad.

18:04.278 --> 18:05.479
How do you feel about it?

18:05.499 --> 18:09.463
Well, I feel it's sad, but I also feel they desperately needed a new library.

18:09.563 --> 18:12.326
And I've been to the new library.

18:12.386 --> 18:12.747
Exactly.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.469
I'm in favour of the new library.

18:14.489 --> 18:16.791
I'm very sad the old one is closing.

18:17.294 --> 18:29.466
Centered around this, there's been an awful lot of sentiment and also seminars about the future of reading, the future of books, the future of information technology.

18:29.486 --> 18:32.710
There's been a lot of that going on, so I've been having to think about it.

18:33.350 --> 18:36.854
And I just come from New York.

18:36.914 --> 18:44.922
As you walk through New York, you see so many information technology shops, shops of computers, shops of computers.

18:45.340 --> 18:50.487
You see one or two Barnes and Noble, but most of it is selling other kinds of stuff.

18:50.527 --> 18:52.670
Look at the ads in the New York Times.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.132
Switch on telly.

18:54.332 --> 18:55.434
What do you see being advertised?

18:55.794 --> 18:56.916
Now, it's very interesting.

18:57.016 --> 19:08.732
I just went on to the... Because I'm doing the Oxford Companion next year, I thought I'd really better get myself on the internet because it'll save me a lot of time with really quite dreary bibliography.

19:08.752 --> 19:09.753
It really is.

19:09.813 --> 19:10.714
And it's well worth it.

19:11.115 --> 19:15.060
But I now understand things on the advert that were completely

19:15.226 --> 19:18.108
gobbled it up to me until I tried to learn to do it myself.

19:18.669 --> 19:28.297
And it's as though you've acted another language, another culture altogether, because you know what Yahoo is, and you know what all these weird words.

19:29.858 --> 19:32.040
I didn't know what we were talking about to begin with.

19:32.541 --> 19:38.045
And now I'm not very good at this yet, but at least I know what it is that we're talking about.

19:38.406 --> 19:41.048
And for a certain sense, it's extremely useful.

19:41.668 --> 19:44.811
Really, I can call the New York Times magazine

19:45.162 --> 19:47.466
I can call the Times in London.

19:48.207 --> 19:50.270
And I can search 50,000 book reviews.

19:51.052 --> 20:01.429
I did this this morning on Margaret Frappell, just to go through the reviews that they've published of your books over the last 15 years or so, just to refresh myself.

20:01.549 --> 20:06.377
And whatever interviews have been published with you, features, they're all

20:06.914 --> 20:09.057
I can get them in five minutes.

20:09.398 --> 20:12.563
Well, you're cleverer than me, because I don't know where they all are.

20:12.723 --> 20:14.566
I don't know if I want to know.

20:14.586 --> 20:17.450
I don't know if I have a need to look.

20:17.851 --> 20:21.396
But, I mean, it is totally useful for this kind of thing.

20:21.416 --> 20:30.390
I mean, the first time I used it, really, I was going to a conference in Strasbourg, and there was a writer there who I'd never heard of, but I knew he was frankly famous.

20:30.775 --> 20:35.340
And it turned out the reason why I hadn't heard him, because he was a French-language, West Indian writer.

20:35.360 --> 20:43.510
And so when I discovered that, I didn't feel so embarrassed that I did manage to print out an article on him, which meant that when I met him, I knew who he was.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.071
I'd read one of these poems.

20:45.091 --> 20:46.793
I actually knew his face was a little thick.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.776
And I thought, well, that's wonderful.

20:48.876 --> 20:51.038
Because I'd never have found that information in London.

20:51.138 --> 20:53.181
It just wouldn't have existed in London.

20:53.201 --> 20:54.202
So it's beautiful.

20:54.722 --> 20:57.846
I've been to the British Library, the New French Library.

20:58.568 --> 20:59.969
I haven't seen that.

20:59.989 --> 21:00.990
I haven't seen that.

21:01.090 --> 21:06.295
Just last week I was at the new German library, and I went up to Leipzig where they're preserving all the old books.

21:06.876 --> 21:13.863
So I'm really concerning myself with digitization of books, which is happening, or also preserving books.

21:14.784 --> 21:16.906
The whole section.

21:16.926 --> 21:17.506
The whole section.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.830
I'm also interested in concepts of the canon.

21:20.850 --> 21:26.415
And here you are, editing another companion to English literature, which is basically a canonical

21:26.800 --> 21:27.200
It is.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.662
It's like Wikipedia.

21:28.682 --> 21:32.186
Do you have thoughts on the canon, I wonder?

21:32.647 --> 21:34.629
Is it a changing canon?

21:35.009 --> 21:36.071
It is changing.

21:36.892 --> 21:38.974
Yes, it's changing all the time.

21:39.455 --> 21:46.222
I mean, the past changes, there's been some quite surprising shifts.

21:46.242 --> 21:51.448
I mean, the first Oxford one was done in 1932, and there's been some enormous shifts of emphasis since then.

21:51.909 --> 21:54.732
But it's interesting how some areas don't change at all.

21:55.032 --> 21:58.896
Walter Scott is still canonical, although nobody reads it.

21:58.916 --> 21:59.857
Well, that's an exaggeration.

21:59.877 --> 22:01.119
Some people read him.

22:01.139 --> 22:03.942
But he's still considered somebody who should be in there.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.905
How do you explain that?

22:06.925 --> 22:11.750
Because he was, at the beginning of the novel, he was important historically.

22:12.471 --> 22:14.573
He's much more referred to than read.

22:14.593 --> 22:16.034
And there are some figures like that.

22:16.155 --> 22:20.259
And in fact, you need them in a reference book, more than the books that people read every day.

22:20.299 --> 22:24.043
Because, you know, people talk about the Waverley novels they're still referred to.

22:24.277 --> 22:27.480
People don't know what they are, so they need to look them up to find out what they are.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.002
Who reads the Fairy Queen today, I wonder.

22:30.242 --> 22:34.686
I don't know, but they certainly need to know, they need to look it up from time to time.

22:34.706 --> 22:36.228
I wonder who does.

22:36.648 --> 22:44.095
It bothers me that here in the United States, you can get a degree in English, and I was an English major.

22:44.575 --> 22:51.301
You can get a degree in literature, English literature, without being required to have studied Shakespeare.

22:51.701 --> 22:52.502
That bothers me.

22:52.722 --> 22:53.423
That is bothering me.

22:53.774 --> 22:58.379
Shakespeare, Chaucer, Spencer, Milton, you take what you want.

22:59.140 --> 23:08.309
Call that degree literature if you want, but call it English literature to be certified as proficient in English literature.

23:08.409 --> 23:09.370
I've never done Shakespeare.

23:09.510 --> 23:13.715
Not saying you didn't do it, but you were required to do it.

23:13.915 --> 23:23.545
I went to this seminar in the New British Library last month, and they were talking about exactly this sort of issue, about whether you should teach children

23:23.744 --> 23:28.231
accessible or inaccessible, whether you should, you know, make them look at the canon.

23:28.251 --> 23:39.129
And one woman said, she had a colleague of her, she was a teacher, she said, I heard her saying, I've got to teach Shakespeare next year and I don't want to.

23:39.149 --> 23:43.356
And she said, the poor children were being taught by that woman who didn't want to teach it.

23:43.957 --> 23:45.360
And then you don't know what to do.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.064
I mean, the lack of motivation is very sad because, I mean, I...

23:48.685 --> 23:52.149
I felt sitting there, I'd love to go and teach some tricks.

23:52.169 --> 23:55.634
I'd love to have half an hour to try and persuade, and it's exciting.

23:55.794 --> 23:59.158
I have a 16-year-old daughter who was a junior in high school last year.

23:59.178 --> 24:02.983
She was a sophomore, and she was reading Macbeth.

24:03.003 --> 24:05.967
And the great joy for me was we read it out loud together.

24:05.987 --> 24:13.997
And she went in, and I explained it for her, and she, of course, the teacher said, Barbara, how do you know this play so far?

24:14.017 --> 24:17.241
And she said, oh, my father and I read it together, you know.

24:17.508 --> 24:21.011
Well, that's a great pleasure to be able to do that.

24:21.031 --> 24:28.579
Well, how could anybody be put off by the prospect of everything to deal with Shakespeare?

24:28.599 --> 24:29.880
It's amazing to me.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.982
I know, because it's hard.

24:32.002 --> 24:32.202
It's hard.

24:32.222 --> 24:35.746
But are you alert to this debate in this country over the canon?

24:36.627 --> 24:41.511
The canon is no more, and the Harold Bloom way to do for this new book by them.

24:41.612 --> 24:47.177
I would be interested in using some of these quotations in this book, because it is very pertinent, especially where you are.

24:47.849 --> 25:01.267
working on the actual companion to... Well, I mean, my view is that you shouldn't... that the canon of the past exists, and it shifts.

25:01.448 --> 25:09.679
I mean, new writers... I mean, publishers like Virago Press changed the canon of late 19th century women's writing.

25:09.719 --> 25:12.563
They republished a lot of... You know, which press is this one?

25:12.643 --> 25:12.964
Virago.

25:12.984 --> 25:14.165
Virago, sorry.

25:14.586 --> 25:17.670
And they were founded in 1970...

25:17.836 --> 25:18.757
I think probably.

25:18.777 --> 25:20.398
They are actually mentioned in the alphabet.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.420
Or maybe they're under feminist publishing.

25:22.440 --> 25:22.961
I'm not sure.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.702
But anyway, they did change.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.806
They changed retrospectively the canon of women writers.

25:28.826 --> 25:35.392
And writers like The Year of Britain, Testament of Youth, Testament of Friendship, all those books came back into print.

25:35.892 --> 25:38.955
And they're now much better known than they were 30 years ago.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.358
So you can actually put things back into it.

25:42.718 --> 25:47.202
You can expand the canon in the past.

25:47.452 --> 25:51.335
Things get lost from the canon, and I don't know quite what I feel about that.

25:51.656 --> 26:00.984
But I am now, even now, I'm beginning, I'm really not supposed to start work towards January, but I'm starting a sort of headword list of meaning writers.

26:01.004 --> 26:09.531
And every time I see something interesting in the paper, I think, well, I'll just put that on my computer and see how that name stands up when I look at it more closely.

26:09.551 --> 26:11.212
Can you give me a couple of examples?

26:12.233 --> 26:12.533
Yes.

26:12.994 --> 26:15.056
Do you mind, by the way, if I contact you at a later point?

26:15.096 --> 26:16.817
Not at all, not at all.

26:17.067 --> 26:23.396
Now, it's quite obvious, for example, that Jim Crates, who was shortlisted for the Booker, will go in.

26:23.936 --> 26:26.900
But what about Adyaraty Roy, who won the Booker?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.082
It's her first novel.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.143
I haven't read it yet.

26:29.264 --> 26:32.268
So we wait and see what happens in the next two or three years.

26:32.889 --> 26:33.810
Anyway, I haven't read it.

26:33.930 --> 26:36.373
Well, but does the Booker automatically get you listed?

26:36.393 --> 26:39.157
Well, the Booker automatically gets you listed.

26:39.297 --> 26:39.818
Exactly.

26:40.034 --> 26:42.477
But then there are writers like, now, who was I?

26:42.757 --> 26:46.722
Now, there's a writer I really admire myself called Edward St.

26:46.742 --> 26:47.122
Orbin.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.505
And he hasn't had anything like the coverage.

26:49.725 --> 26:54.110
He's a friend and a contemporary of Will Self, who everybody talks about.

26:54.631 --> 26:55.973
He has a very high profile.

26:56.313 --> 26:56.673
Edward St.

26:56.774 --> 26:58.035
Orbin never appeared.

26:58.055 --> 27:00.017
He's never interviewed, never done anything.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.881
But I would like to put him into the Oxford St.

27:02.901 --> 27:06.565
Daniels just because I admire his work and see what happens.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.421
But I shall sit on that one for a bit.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.423
He's on my list.

27:09.443 --> 27:11.848
Now what do you mean by see what happens?

27:12.028 --> 27:17.338
Well, if you put people in, do people then think, oh, it's one Buchanan, I'll read it.

27:17.759 --> 27:18.541
I just don't know.

27:18.881 --> 27:20.264
I don't know quite how it works.

27:20.284 --> 27:28.620
But my own feeling is that even a reference has to have a personal aspect of conviction.

27:29.174 --> 27:34.743
And I don't want to put people in who I think really aren't worthy, even if everybody else thinks they're wonderful.

27:34.863 --> 27:48.424
I want there to be an element of personal judgment, which also allows me the personal pleasure of putting in people that I think are excellent, but are not highly or widely accepted as being excellent.

27:48.584 --> 27:53.832
So obviously there's consensus over Martin Amis and Julian Barnes.

27:54.132 --> 28:04.528
There's a worry about how many American authors I have, because after all it's English literature, but obviously major American authors have to be there because there's a lot of... But there's also an Oxford companion to American literature.

28:04.948 --> 28:05.329
There is.

28:05.349 --> 28:12.339
So you have to... In fact, you see, I'm just reading Jane Smiley at the moment, enjoying her enormously, but she is very American.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.561
Have you read Jane Smiley?

28:13.581 --> 28:14.863
Oh, I looked at her in 2008.

28:14.943 --> 28:15.364
I love her.

28:15.384 --> 28:16.045
It's a wonderful book.

28:16.065 --> 28:17.107
The Moo book, I thought.

28:17.167 --> 28:17.467
Moo.

28:17.547 --> 28:18.729
It was delightful.

28:18.749 --> 28:19.811
Did you read that one?

28:19.831 --> 28:20.351
Yeah, that's funny.

28:20.391 --> 28:21.994
I started with Moo, actually.

28:22.014 --> 28:22.755
But, I mean, she...

28:23.393 --> 28:25.755
No one could pretend she's an English author.

28:25.775 --> 28:26.796
She's very American.

28:26.816 --> 28:27.757
Except that this is Lear.

28:29.719 --> 28:30.100
Exactly.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.142
I think I can sneak it in.

28:32.162 --> 28:34.304
And it's a plot, absolutely.

28:34.384 --> 28:37.527
And Wool, by the way, is a Shakespearean comedy.

28:37.847 --> 28:39.309
She teaches Shakespeare now.

28:39.829 --> 28:41.591
Well, I think I can put her in.

28:41.911 --> 28:43.453
And I'd love it.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.654
On those grounds alone.

28:44.674 --> 28:45.375
On those grounds alone.

28:45.415 --> 28:52.021
I should send you the interview I did with her, because her last three novels were mindfully takeoffs in Shakespearean plays.

28:52.902 --> 28:52.962
Oh.

28:53.313 --> 29:01.660
a history prior to this, this one, this is a tragedy, this is a comedy, you know, and very, very interesting.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.302
But how about taking people out?

29:03.482 --> 29:07.365
Adding people is one thing, but I would say... Well, taking people out is very difficult.

29:08.306 --> 29:15.652
I'm going to have to, I think possibly, but this is something to do with the canon, to do with the economy of publishing a book.

29:15.672 --> 29:22.358
I think I may take out quite a lot of medieval literature, which isn't even in English, I mean, it's in Middle English.

29:22.793 --> 29:28.400
I think that that has become perhaps something for a separate reference book.

29:28.420 --> 29:29.681
I mean, I could save a lot of space.

29:29.762 --> 29:37.010
Last time, I took out from the original Harvey all the capital references because there just isn't room for that in one volume.

29:37.331 --> 29:50.067
And I think I may make the decision, which some scholars will complain about, is taking out a lot of the medieval references because any student who's a specialist will have to have specialist references for that.

29:50.127 --> 29:51.248
And I'm not quite sure

29:51.464 --> 29:53.146
how useful it is for the average.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.849
Well, that makes sense.

29:54.869 --> 29:57.532
But how about coming forward from medieval times?

29:57.793 --> 30:02.840
Well, I mean, I know that I've given too much coverage, for instance, to Paul Scott.

30:02.860 --> 30:08.648
His item is ludicrously long, because I'd just read Jewel in the Crown, and my copy editor has dawed him.

30:08.928 --> 30:12.453
And this piece just got longer and longer, and I now see it's disproportionately long.

30:12.673 --> 30:14.175
So we just top it down a bit.

30:14.215 --> 30:16.999
Are you alert to fashion, literary?

30:17.401 --> 30:20.985
Maybe that's not the right word, but... Yes, I mean, I am.

30:21.125 --> 30:25.930
I know who's in and out.

30:27.072 --> 30:34.600
But I think one shouldn't be bound by that, because I think you can see that some people are in fashion because of a sort of quirk of publicity.

30:34.700 --> 30:45.552
The Scottish phenomenon at the moment in England, in Britain, I should say, is very interesting, because Scottish-ness is very... I think fashion is this a word.

30:46.055 --> 30:49.139
And now we've got to devolve at Parliament.

30:49.159 --> 30:50.461
It may become even more so.

30:50.541 --> 30:53.665
On the other hand, it may be that some of you like a professional or something to accept.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.507
Who was the fellow that won that book?

30:55.548 --> 30:56.208
Don't tell them.

30:56.489 --> 30:57.190
Don't tell them.

30:57.210 --> 30:59.833
That set the modern record for the F-word, I think.

31:00.294 --> 31:01.255
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:01.395 --> 31:03.678
Why do you have this one?

31:03.698 --> 31:05.280
He seems a very nice man.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.442
Very nice.

31:06.462 --> 31:08.665
All his own cigarettes.

31:09.406 --> 31:10.888
And a serious, a serious, right?

31:10.908 --> 31:12.430
Yeah, but that's so much.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.653
It was quite surprising, wasn't it?

31:14.673 --> 31:14.813
It was.

31:15.012 --> 31:19.459
I was in Sweden just the day after they announced this new Nobel laureate.

31:19.479 --> 31:21.181
Oh, yeah.

31:21.201 --> 31:22.042
Quite a shock.

31:22.062 --> 31:22.783
Yeah, that is right.

31:22.803 --> 31:23.865
Yeah, yeah.

31:23.905 --> 31:26.809
People were surprised by that, yeah.

31:26.829 --> 31:28.892
Even in Italy, I mean, I think most surprisingly.

31:28.973 --> 31:32.478
I went to the Nobel library the day after that happened.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.243
I'm interested in the library, which was established in 1901.

31:36.263 --> 31:39.969
So it's parameters that right now is strictly the 20th century.

31:39.989 --> 31:43.534
And the only books they acquire are of living authors.

31:43.683 --> 31:45.105
Tolstoy is long dead.

31:45.746 --> 31:48.450
People who didn't get the Nobel Prize.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.372
And you can access that database, by the way.

31:50.893 --> 31:54.177
And you can see, I don't know what you can draw from this, but I took very careful notes.

31:54.197 --> 31:58.784
There were, for instance, on Tolstoy, maybe 150 kids.

31:58.844 --> 32:01.327
Which means his name had come up, even though he never won the award.

32:01.367 --> 32:02.309
Gibson never won the award.

32:02.389 --> 32:03.891
Stringberg never won the award.

32:03.911 --> 32:05.072
I mean, look at the people.

32:05.273 --> 32:10.039
Yeah, Stringberg, the greatest Swedish writer, the Römelin, didn't win the award.

32:10.059 --> 32:12.863
Yeah, Karin Sarkis didn't get it.

32:13.315 --> 32:17.343
So I started Glam Green.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.347
Glam Green had a bunch of entries in there.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.511
I'm going to write about this, actually.

32:21.531 --> 32:24.877
Joyce Carol Oates had 89 entries.

32:24.897 --> 32:27.502
That means her books have been requested 89 entries.

32:27.522 --> 32:29.907
They've been brought in, so they go out and they get them.

32:30.173 --> 32:31.675
I thought so.

32:31.735 --> 32:34.760
It's kind of fun.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.848
And this woman was showing me, let me urge you not to never draw too many conclusions from those numbers.

32:39.988 --> 32:43.113
I said, I'm alert to that, but let me also say it's very interesting.

32:43.133 --> 32:43.694
Just the numbers.

32:44.175 --> 32:46.579
Well, that tells you nothing, doesn't it?

32:46.939 --> 32:48.622
Just by the frequency.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.144
Graham Greene had a ton.

32:50.184 --> 32:51.086
Nabokov had a few.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.688
All these people would have been there.

32:53.225 --> 32:57.830
But it's amazing the people who have not won the Nobel Prize, and then you look at the list of those.

32:57.870 --> 32:59.992
But of course, there is that sort of language rotation.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.414
I think it's more than language.

33:02.434 --> 33:04.737
I think it's nationality and political, for sure.

33:04.897 --> 33:09.221
I mean, Green's politics undoubtedly denied him the award.

33:09.341 --> 33:12.264
I'm sorry to go off on a tangent here.

33:12.284 --> 33:15.988
Well, no, I mean, it's all fascinating.

33:16.048 --> 33:18.471
It's all kind of my own life, too.

33:18.511 --> 33:19.772
Does a novel have to be relevant?

33:20.832 --> 33:25.259
Well, it is to me that I enjoy novels that aren't relevant.

33:25.279 --> 33:33.811
But to me, a novel, the kind of novels I like to write, that I'm speaking personally, tend to be about the contemporary and all about society.

33:33.831 --> 33:41.903
But I can very much enjoy, I'm trying to think of somebody, I mean, Alan Hollinghurst, who is not really a relevant writer, who's one of the most beautiful writers.

33:41.923 --> 33:43.646
So I appreciate that I could be right.

33:43.666 --> 33:45.589
But to me, my own expression of art is social writing, I suppose.

33:46.390 --> 33:47.852
And to explain that behind your own way.

34:00.860 --> 34:01.782
No, the old one.

34:01.802 --> 34:03.164
That's okay, don't tell me.

34:03.184 --> 34:11.618
But I published a piece in The Guardian on Saturday, this Saturday, about the reading room.

34:11.759 --> 34:12.640
This past Saturday?

34:12.660 --> 34:17.068
This past Saturday.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.131
I should probably get that on the internet, believe it or not.

34:19.532 --> 34:21.616
You may well be able to hear it.

34:22.477 --> 34:22.958
I find it.

34:24.060 --> 34:24.741
It's from...

34:30.121 --> 34:34.086
It was Saturday, October the 18th.

34:36.949 --> 34:41.655
And the day that women were admitted into the reading room was 1762.

34:41.715 --> 34:43.878
What period?

34:44.939 --> 34:47.182
I'm sorry.

34:47.202 --> 34:47.903
1762.

34:49.505 --> 34:54.711
And they'd been admitted into the present reading room, which was 1862.

34:55.012 --> 34:57.295
They've always been admitted into that.

34:57.475 --> 35:02.841
I think the original reading was written in 1758 or something, and women were admitted almost immediately.

35:03.441 --> 35:04.863
Which is rather surprising.

35:04.883 --> 35:05.664
It really is.

35:07.546 --> 35:07.646
Yeah.

35:07.666 --> 35:09.688
Now where did you find that?

35:10.870 --> 35:17.577
I found that from the archivist at the British Library, whose name is

35:21.657 --> 35:23.800
Not John Hopkins, but it's something very light.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.422
It's Hobson, something like that.

35:25.762 --> 35:27.625
But his official title is The Archivist.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.211
And I'm sure his... That is fascinating.

35:33.433 --> 35:34.895
I'm winning out of time, I think.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.062
Can I write you on this?

35:40.162 --> 35:41.323
Of course, yeah.

35:41.363 --> 35:44.948
I'll be happy to send you copies of anything I do on this.

35:45.429 --> 35:47.612
No, that sounds very interesting.

35:47.632 --> 35:50.095
If you could just tell me where to write you.

35:50.277 --> 35:50.678
Fine.

35:51.739 --> 35:54.042
Do you want a fax number or an address or what?

35:54.062 --> 35:54.683
Fax would be fine.

35:54.703 --> 35:55.745
I'll give you the fax number.

35:55.765 --> 35:56.746
I like that.

35:56.766 --> 35:59.871
Provided you don't fax me 92 pages of paper.

36:00.231 --> 36:02.174
It'll be a one page query.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.517
You'll know that terrified thing.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.460
And before long you'll have an email address.

36:06.921 --> 36:08.423
I do, but I don't know how to use it.

36:08.523 --> 36:10.366
I won't give it to you because I'm so nervous.

36:10.386 --> 36:11.988
Okay, well you're going to love it once you learn it.

36:12.128 --> 36:12.909
I know, I know.

36:13.009 --> 36:16.014
I've got the facility, but I don't.

36:16.134 --> 36:19.018
I've emailed my son in Australia two or three times.

36:19.218 --> 36:24.204
I'll give you my fact, it's much more allowable.

36:24.244 --> 36:26.687
It's 0181, which is 004481, I suppose.

36:26.827 --> 36:35.096
00... 44181 586 9265.

36:36.298 --> 36:40.122
Now, do you and your husband still work separately apart?

36:40.142 --> 36:42.385
No, no, we've joined before.

36:42.405 --> 36:45.148
I've sold my house and moved in with him.

36:45.969 --> 36:47.571
Well, that's interesting.

36:48.158 --> 36:52.402
Has that changed the work schedule, the dynamic at all?

36:52.842 --> 36:53.583
It has a bit.

36:53.983 --> 36:56.225
I always complain that we get up later.

36:56.265 --> 37:03.291
When we lived apart, we used to get up secretly early, and now we have a cup of coffee and laze around.

37:04.312 --> 37:07.935
The day starts an hour later for both of us than it used to.

37:07.955 --> 37:11.197
But we do have separate floors to work on, because it's a big house.

37:11.217 --> 37:12.859
It's a big house, and we can't really hear each other.

37:12.879 --> 37:17.963
We have a little bell that we ring, which we find more friendly than an intercom.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.186
We ring his little bell to let each other know that we're moving around the house.

37:22.206 --> 37:23.327
What's Michael working on now?

37:23.608 --> 37:25.430
He's writing a family memoir.

37:25.450 --> 37:26.452
Oh, really?

37:27.473 --> 37:31.038
He's sort of halfway through.

37:31.058 --> 37:31.899
I've got plenty of stuff.

37:31.919 --> 37:33.261
Would you describe this book for me?

37:33.562 --> 37:34.122
I would indeed.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.626
Do you mind, by the way, if I take a photograph of you?

37:36.766 --> 37:37.647
I'd be delighted.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.071
Now, let me just make sure I'm spelling you right.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.835
You're Nicholas with an inch.

37:43.355 --> 37:48.102
Are you...

37:48.655 --> 37:50.997
Have you been shaped by your reading, would you say?

37:51.618 --> 37:54.800
Are you a person who has been shaped by your reading?

37:54.820 --> 37:55.301
Yes.

37:55.601 --> 37:56.542
By the books that you read?

37:56.562 --> 38:06.050
I mean, if anything, I sometimes think too much, in that I hear them sounding in my head all the time, and every book I write is a sort of conversation with all the books I've ever read.

38:06.771 --> 38:15.499
And I've been, yes, I started reading at the age of three, so my mother always said.

38:15.519 --> 38:16.680
I think she was exaggerating a bit.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.021
But I...

38:18.271 --> 38:22.739
been profoundly influenced by everything I've read.

38:22.759 --> 38:27.006
And when I say everything, I almost mean that.

38:28.529 --> 38:35.762
My head is full of dialogue with authors, some of them long dead, and lines from parents.

38:35.782 --> 38:40.209
And do they in any way influence or shape things that you write, do you think?

38:40.229 --> 38:40.310
Yes.

38:41.051 --> 38:42.253
Undoubtedly, they do.

38:42.638 --> 38:48.907
And in a way, I think if you're a reader, it's inevitable that your head should be full of echoes.

38:49.368 --> 38:59.442
And I think it's one of the problems of writing now, in a post-modern stage, in that our heads are all full of intertextuality and mystery illusion.

38:59.883 --> 39:04.429
And in a way, it's one of the great blessings, because there's a long tradition of the past to talk to.

39:04.750 --> 39:09.777
It must have been very strange living in the 17th century, and knowing there was a limit of

39:10.094 --> 39:14.302
amount of the classics that you had to study, because there weren't any more texts to go beyond them.

39:14.322 --> 39:15.625
Once you've done them, you've done them.

39:16.066 --> 39:17.769
It must have been a very odd feeling.

39:18.170 --> 39:18.571
That's funny.

39:18.591 --> 39:26.767
You know, I think it's styrin when people worry about whether or not there will be readers for the serious books that are being written.

39:26.787 --> 39:27.649
I think it's styrin.

39:27.669 --> 39:32.338
They said, look, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, they were always

39:32.673 --> 39:35.256
was a very small percentage of the Russian people who were literate.

39:35.477 --> 39:40.843
They were writing for a very small segment of society and look at the great novels that they wrote.

39:41.464 --> 39:49.795
And maybe there are only a very small... Maybe there always is only a proportion of the population will ever be serious readers.

39:49.815 --> 39:50.536
That may be true.

39:51.016 --> 39:55.021
And it may not matter because that's the percentage, the 10% or whatever.

39:55.402 --> 39:59.447
But even out of the literate or so-called literate community will go on reading.

39:59.567 --> 40:01.650
So it doesn't matter that the rest of them compete again.

40:01.670 --> 40:02.511
Do you agree with that?

40:02.677 --> 40:04.781
I think it may be true, my optimistic self.

40:05.162 --> 40:09.871
Well, in a way it's pessimistic because it means that other people will never have the pleasure that one has had oneself in reading.

40:10.252 --> 40:13.819
But I don't think reading will die because I think that there will always be that 10%.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.225
I think there will always be that number of people.

40:17.586 --> 40:18.688
We don't know what the percent is.

40:19.129 --> 40:21.434
It may not be 10%.

40:21.975 --> 40:23.638
It may not even be 10%.

40:23.872 --> 40:30.908
I mean, as a young person, I used to think it was infinitely expandable, this percentage of readers, and I used to think education was spread.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.311
I don't believe that now.

40:32.651 --> 40:36.801
But I thought, hello, it may be a constant of the day.

40:36.861 --> 40:38.404
Maybe it is going to vanish.
