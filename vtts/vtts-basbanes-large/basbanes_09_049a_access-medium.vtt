WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:05.195
the subject of your lectures are.

00:05.276 --> 00:07.959
I know you're giving a series of them here.

00:08.620 --> 00:27.887
This was called, at their request, it was called the beginning of the subject, and they said we want you to talk about the history of warfare, and I called it A Brief History of Warfare, Past, Present, and Future, in 15 pages.

00:28.928 --> 00:32.333
I just got to the finishing line by the 15th page.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.023
And did you open it up to questions?

00:35.043 --> 00:35.263
Yes.

00:35.663 --> 00:36.545
Very good questions.

00:36.705 --> 00:39.949
What are people interested in?

00:40.029 --> 00:41.512
I'm curious.

00:41.552 --> 00:44.135
What's the lay question there?

00:44.355 --> 00:46.358
Immodestly.

00:46.398 --> 00:47.720
Generally, I'm going to talk about it.

00:47.760 --> 00:56.452
But immodestly, I do have to say, it's very strange, because it's not the case in my own country, but I do have a strange sort of leadership in this country.

00:56.552 --> 00:59.316
I mean, they...

00:59.903 --> 01:08.432
People write to me in Britain, and when I come, they say, I'm one of your fans, and I've got all your books.

01:08.492 --> 01:09.653
I mean, it's very peculiar.

01:09.953 --> 01:14.738
And I think... So I fit right in by bringing the Navy people in.

01:14.758 --> 01:18.902
And I think some of the people come to lecture them because they want to meet me.

01:19.062 --> 01:28.652
They're not so much interested, I think they're interested in the subject, sure, but they're interested in, which is a very peculiar feeling, because, I mean, I'm a family man.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.573
I live in the country.

01:29.806 --> 01:33.451
My children, my wife, of course, have put me in my place there.

01:33.471 --> 01:36.315
It's very peculiar to come to the U.S.

01:36.495 --> 01:39.959
and meet people who call themselves.

01:40.720 --> 01:50.833
Well, you certainly have developed an expertise that has gone beyond academe, and that's quite phenomenal, isn't it?

01:50.994 --> 01:52.776
Well, I approve of that, because I think...

01:53.262 --> 01:56.947
One of the things I've got a game stack, I was an academic for many, many years.

01:57.067 --> 02:00.152
I hesitated whether I should be calling him Professor.

02:00.252 --> 02:12.790
I mean, I think the way it's just as bad in our country, the way academia sort of shut itself off from

02:14.086 --> 02:16.991
The ordinary educated public, I think, is disgraceful.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.273
It is terrible.

02:18.313 --> 02:19.214
They talk to each other.

02:19.615 --> 02:21.238
They've invented this weird language.

02:21.338 --> 02:24.643
The more obscure it is, the cleverer they think they are.

02:24.703 --> 02:33.798
As a critic, for instance, I will go through the catalogs of university presses, and you will see, I think, a title that on the surface looks wonderful.

02:34.459 --> 02:37.645
You say, oh, I can't wait to see what this guy does with this.

02:37.665 --> 02:40.870
But when you get it, it has been written for his colleagues.

02:41.407 --> 02:44.351
The whole purpose is to obfuscate.

02:44.491 --> 02:50.460
And you might have the germ there of a wonderful story, but you've totally lost it.

02:50.500 --> 02:59.734
And that's why I really applaud you for writing and publishing in the general and the trade, as opposed to the specialized presses.

02:59.894 --> 03:03.379
I mean, I could have sold my book to Yale University Press.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.041
And they were very interested.

03:05.061 --> 03:08.807
And it wasn't because I wanted... Well, yeah, I had a little bit too much commerce.

03:08.827 --> 03:09.608
I won't deny that.

03:10.043 --> 03:13.146
But, you know, you want a right to be read, I think.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.809
I'm sorry to be commenting here.

03:15.830 --> 03:18.272
Not at all, no, no, because, I mean, I think you're absolutely right.

03:20.515 --> 03:25.941
I've never met him, but I call him a friend because we correspond.

03:25.981 --> 03:30.606
I've never even spoken on the telephone, but we correspond quite frequently.

03:30.866 --> 03:37.654
He's a young American called Victor Davis Hanson from the University of California, Fresno.

03:38.123 --> 03:42.309
which is not one of the major branches of the University of California.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.616
And I think he's an absolutely outstanding military historian.

03:46.636 --> 03:47.958
He's a classical scholar.

03:49.220 --> 04:00.096
And he wrote a most remarkable book for five years ago called The Western Way of Warfare.

04:00.116 --> 04:07.607
It was about the Western Way of Warfare battle in the Greek city state or something called it.

04:08.178 --> 04:14.545
And he was published by Viking.

04:14.565 --> 04:24.977
And he was urged by older classical scholars not to publish it as a book, but to try it out as chapters.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.962
It's very revolutionary stuff, Victor.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.325
You know, it isn't orthodox.

04:32.886 --> 04:34.148
You know, you're a young scholar.

04:34.168 --> 04:37.712
You must be very, I mean, you must sort of

04:38.182 --> 04:43.308
offer it to the judgment of your peers, and I think they meant your elders and betters, too.

04:43.488 --> 04:48.633
And then they said, above all, you mustn't publish it with Viking, which is not an academic publisher.

04:49.174 --> 04:53.238
If you're going to publish the book, you ought to go to an academic publishing house.

04:54.099 --> 05:01.287
And in fact, he turned them down.

05:02.228 --> 05:09.255
It's been extremely well received, but he says that he's no doubt that his academic career has suffered as a result.

05:09.275 --> 05:09.916
Isn't that ridiculous?

05:10.656 --> 05:12.879
So they don't recognize him?

05:12.939 --> 05:31.577
Because he went to, the older professors at Stanford asked him to apply for a tenure position, and he went there, and the older professors voted him in, and the younger professors voted him out, and he didn't get the job because he didn't have, it was his first book, and it wasn't

05:31.912 --> 05:32.894
from an academic press.

05:32.914 --> 05:33.615
That's absurd.

05:34.616 --> 05:35.878
That's really ridiculous.

05:36.339 --> 05:37.902
But I know where they're coming from.

05:38.062 --> 05:44.732
I mean, the whole point is you're writing to impress your colleagues, not just to impress them, to speak to them.

05:45.193 --> 05:46.816
It's almost they're so proprietary.

05:47.016 --> 05:49.280
It's their turf.

05:49.300 --> 05:59.556
I know I found that when I was, I did a lot of research in libraries and universities, and I encountered a lot of resentment, because how dare this professional writer

06:00.717 --> 06:04.141
I mean, I won't name any names, but a fellow in California.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.845
How dare I come out and try and write about Henry Huntington?

06:07.125 --> 06:09.308
He spent 20 years researching him.

06:09.588 --> 06:14.734
I mean, he was, he was, oh, I just hope they don't give this guy the book to review.

06:14.754 --> 06:14.854
Sure.

06:15.355 --> 06:19.140
But I mean, I think his attitude should be, how wonderful.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.181
Great, yeah.

06:21.182 --> 06:27.670
Somebody who hasn't devoted 20 years of his life to my special subject is actually interested in you, and what can I tell him?

06:28.207 --> 06:31.630
Well, this fellow's book was just published by the University of California Press.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.891
Nice book, well done.

06:34.273 --> 06:35.454
It's an unknown book.

06:35.474 --> 06:42.160
I mean, I haven't seen a single review of it, but anyway, we'll see what happens.

06:42.180 --> 06:51.828
If you don't mind just talking in generalities, because books really speak so eloquently for themselves.

06:51.848 --> 06:57.994
And you do even, you mention in the History of Warfare book how you became fascinated

06:58.278 --> 07:04.147
by the subject, but I wonder if, for the sake of some quotations, you could go back.

07:05.909 --> 07:25.198
I think my father, who was a very nice father, I was devoted to him, and he made great influence on my early life, and he'd been a soldier in the First World War.

07:25.759 --> 07:26.901
Just, you know, called up.

07:27.657 --> 07:35.529
draftee, but it was clearly the most important thing that had ever happened to him, and nothing ever happened like that again.

07:36.650 --> 07:40.897
A defining event of his... Yes, exactly, a defining event.

07:40.917 --> 07:51.031
Not that he was a bore about it, and he didn't go on about it, but you could tell that it was a dramatic passage in his life.

07:51.813 --> 07:56.820
And I suppose that, and he was admired, although he went back, he was a

07:57.475 --> 08:03.523
a... I don't have it in America.

08:03.603 --> 08:05.425
He was what was called an inspector of schools.

08:07.368 --> 08:13.996
It's a sort of... It's a national service in Britain.

08:15.118 --> 08:18.883
They sort of set educational standards.

08:18.903 --> 08:20.845
They go right to schools sometimes.

08:20.865 --> 08:22.728
And that's what my father did.

08:24.490 --> 08:26.993
Rather like a roving principal, actually.

08:28.238 --> 08:29.739
So he didn't.

08:29.980 --> 08:34.965
I mean, he had a very staid life when he came back from the war.

08:37.147 --> 08:43.453
But it was clear that that was just a great thing.

08:44.634 --> 08:50.640
And then during the war, he went down his area.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.762
He had a district of schools.

08:53.223 --> 08:57.807
The HMI, they were called Her Majesty's, or His Majesty's, inspectors of schools.

08:58.192 --> 09:04.641
They had districts, and his district was in London, and it was evacuated to the country for the war.

09:05.782 --> 09:19.640
And he sort of took the schools down, and they had to be put out into village halls, and fairly buildings, and we spent the whole war in the country.

09:21.062 --> 09:25.468
And it happened to be the bit of the West Country, which the Americans came to.

09:25.488 --> 09:27.591
We had to be smack in the heart of it.

09:28.162 --> 09:32.027
Well, the 29th Division and the 1st Division were waiting to go to Normandy.

09:33.709 --> 09:38.514
And I suspect that there were more Americans than English people in our bit of England.

09:38.614 --> 09:42.058
I mean, they were jam-packed.

09:42.078 --> 09:48.966
And the skies were full of American airplanes, and the roads were full of American equipment, and the towns and villages were full of American soldiers.

09:49.928 --> 09:57.156
And it was a very, very extraordinary spectacle for a nine- or ten-year-old boy.

09:57.558 --> 10:01.282
And I could see something tremendously dramatic was happening.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.965
And I was already very interested in history.

10:03.985 --> 10:05.426
I was sort of a bookish little boy.

10:08.089 --> 10:21.363
And when I started to study history properly in high school, I got extremely interested in history in the Second World War.

10:21.603 --> 10:25.928
And when I went off to Oxford in 1953,

10:26.667 --> 10:29.030
you had to choose a special subject.

10:29.050 --> 10:39.584
There was a set history course, but you also had a choice of special subjects, 12 special subjects, which one was military history, so I chose military history.

10:39.604 --> 10:42.367
And I suppose then that fixed it for me.

10:43.609 --> 10:50.538
And I had this, I thought, you know, I thought you could actually be a professional military historian.

10:50.878 --> 10:53.181
So that's what I became.

10:53.887 --> 11:01.019
This book really does more or less crystallize a lot of the earlier books.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.701
You don't mind my jumping around.

11:03.142 --> 11:08.130
This is a history of warfare.

11:08.831 --> 11:14.781
It's a very bold thing to attempt, isn't it?

11:16.313 --> 11:20.096
And one point, I should have been on trial.

11:21.017 --> 11:22.238
I should have been on trial.

11:22.258 --> 11:30.426
I should have been on trial.

11:32.468 --> 11:34.069
Well, the thing was, I was like you.

11:34.129 --> 11:35.871
I read and read and read and read.

11:35.931 --> 11:42.116
I had a huge collection of books.

11:42.337 --> 11:44.218
Mind you, I read them.

11:44.599 --> 11:46.000
It's not a game.

11:46.469 --> 11:51.775
bibliography which academics don't prove on because it only contains the books which I actually find useful.

11:51.876 --> 12:11.800
I don't, you know, you can, you see a text reference in a book and you think, oh, and you turn to the back and the text reference is that long and you think, well, I wish you'd say which was a really useful book because what are these people doing?

12:11.860 --> 12:14.343
Are they writers or are they librarians?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.105
You get the feeling that most

12:16.540 --> 12:25.929
I mean, they're so concerned to impress their colleagues with not merely what they... The apparatus, they call it.

12:26.289 --> 12:28.271
The textual apparatus.

12:28.371 --> 12:28.792
Exactly.

12:29.693 --> 12:37.580
With their knowledge of how many books actually bear on the subject that the text references I don't find useful.

12:37.640 --> 12:44.927
My text references are books that I actually think other people ought to read on the subject.

12:45.920 --> 13:02.138
But anyhow, I'd read, asked about it, I owned all these books, and I thought, I've done, you know, I've done battles, I've done armies, I've done generals, I've done war at sea, I've done history of the First and the Second World War.

13:03.099 --> 13:06.522
I really ought to try and put it all together, really try.

13:07.443 --> 13:11.548
If I don't, I shall be senile quite soon.

13:12.409 --> 13:14.131
Did you expect to learn something yourself?

13:14.191 --> 13:15.252
Yes, I did, very much.

13:15.569 --> 13:18.292
Were you trying to sort things out for yourself?

13:18.412 --> 13:19.173
Yes, I was.

13:19.654 --> 13:24.159
I always think that writing a book is a piece of self-education.

13:24.879 --> 13:26.301
You probably felt the same about it.

13:26.321 --> 13:27.002
Sure, it's a discovery.

13:27.022 --> 13:27.422
Yes.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.984
It's almost serendipity.

13:31.667 --> 13:37.694
What did you... Obviously, Klausowitz was a major target.

13:37.714 --> 13:39.336
I hate to use the word target.

13:39.616 --> 13:45.002
That's not the right metaphor for a book on warfare, I suppose.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.005
Well, I used that as a device, really, just to get started.

13:51.446 --> 13:54.370
I thought I knew more than I did.

13:54.430 --> 13:58.835
I don't know whether you thought you knew more than you did when you began.

13:59.176 --> 14:07.407
I'm going to a newspaper event, and I've always felt that you need to know ten times as much as you're ever going to put in the book or anything.

14:09.650 --> 14:11.793
But I don't think I just felt that way.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.196
The way to answer your question, no, I...

14:14.581 --> 14:33.043
I knew that, but I did think I knew a lot, and there were some things I thought, when I actually came to write them, I either physically didn't know things, or I knew them but I hadn't sorted out what their significance was.

14:33.083 --> 14:42.934
And so I did write continuously for nearly three years, but I quite often stopped for

14:44.230 --> 14:58.668
perhaps a month, to get something really clear to myself, particularly about the sort of behavioral science of warfare and the anthropology of warfare.

14:58.928 --> 15:11.183
And I later on discovered that I didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did about the nomad peoples

15:11.416 --> 15:16.043
I thought I'd read a lot about them, but I hadn't read enough.

15:16.063 --> 15:17.966
I know the Turks, Mongols, people like that.

15:17.986 --> 15:23.514
You really opened my eyes on the Cossacks, I have to say.

15:23.534 --> 15:39.718
I didn't realize that they were so... I'm searching for the right word, but I always thought they were just totally ruthless and, you know, that they would charge into the valley, but they were very cunning.

15:40.137 --> 15:41.578
NOMADs are, I think.

15:41.599 --> 15:53.231
They weren't exactly NOMADs, but I've subsequently read more than I knew about the Plains Indians.

15:53.751 --> 15:54.872
Great similarities.

15:54.892 --> 16:00.278
I mean, the Plains Indians were ferocious, but they were very good at saving their own skins, too.

16:00.338 --> 16:01.759
They'd run away.

16:02.901 --> 16:05.363
There was one review I read of your book about death.

16:07.706 --> 16:09.047
You certainly aren't worried about death.

16:09.517 --> 16:10.778
on political correctness.

16:10.918 --> 16:18.245
I mean, you call it the way you have, I mean, it's very bad form now to even say Indians now.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.386
They're Native Americans.

16:19.406 --> 16:20.207
I know they are.

16:20.307 --> 16:21.789
I do say Native Americans.

16:21.809 --> 16:22.649
I know that's fine.

16:22.669 --> 16:23.290
They're Indians.

16:23.310 --> 16:36.342
I mean, and it's almost verboten to say that they were fierce and, you know, cut living hearts out of the chest.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.405
Actually, one of the nice things about being

16:39.706 --> 16:51.763
English-speaking in America, but not being American, is that Americans will let you say politically incorrect things, but they would not allow a fellow American to say.

16:51.823 --> 16:52.103
It is.

16:52.183 --> 16:56.970
I think you're absolutely correct, but who could argue with the observations?

16:57.070 --> 17:02.558
I mean, they're perfectly valid.

17:02.578 --> 17:09.207
Do people find it comforting and a bizarrely ironic kind of a way to be

17:09.490 --> 17:13.395
told that, well, it's part of human nature.

17:13.435 --> 17:18.282
Warfare is part of human nature, so it's almost excusable, I guess.

17:18.862 --> 17:20.825
Some do and some don't.

17:20.905 --> 17:23.028
I think you get great fierceness.

17:25.331 --> 17:29.957
You get through to the Margaret Neat School, you know, war is an invention.

17:30.998 --> 17:38.068
I mean, Margaret Neat really is the inventor of political correctness.

17:38.088 --> 17:38.248
Sure is.

17:40.068 --> 18:10.007
and I think not only women although feminism is much much stronger in the United States than it is in Britain for example and you do get American women who are very very fierce on the subject of if you say well it's possible that man is I don't know I really don't know if you say it's possible that man does

18:10.493 --> 18:13.196
have innate aggressive urges.

18:13.236 --> 18:15.118
They get very cross about it.

18:15.138 --> 18:20.523
Well, and now, are they allowing women to be fighter pilots in the UK?

18:20.723 --> 18:22.665
They're thinking about it.

18:22.685 --> 18:28.451
They are trading, but it hasn't gone as far as it has in this country.

18:28.531 --> 18:29.692
I wonder how that'll play out.

18:30.433 --> 18:30.793
Don't matter.

18:30.813 --> 18:34.036
We're having great trouble with women aboard ships.

18:35.057 --> 18:37.760
I used to live three years in an aircraft carrier.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.842
I can't imagine what it was like.

18:40.497 --> 18:41.598
to have women on the ship.

18:41.658 --> 18:45.664
It's a bafflement to me that they're actually doing it.

18:45.684 --> 18:47.406
You were in the pre-woman Navy.

18:47.806 --> 18:49.268
I was in the Vietnam War.

18:49.569 --> 18:49.829
Right.

18:49.949 --> 18:58.140
When I read about your father going off to World War I and how he regarded it, I regarded the Vietnam War in my life precisely the same way.

18:58.821 --> 19:01.023
This was an event that I never questioned.

19:02.045 --> 19:03.427
Were you a regular?

19:03.447 --> 19:04.768
I was a reserve officer.

19:04.788 --> 19:07.652
I went to OCS at Newport.

19:08.645 --> 19:14.870
I spent three years as a junior officer on the Ariscity, quite a marvelous aircraft carrier, actually.

19:14.890 --> 19:16.091
Right.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.373
And did two combat cruises to Vietnam.

19:19.334 --> 19:22.997
What, was that a fleet carrier?

19:23.438 --> 19:24.799
It was an attack carrier.

19:24.819 --> 19:28.582
It was an old 27 Charlie, an Essex-class carrier.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.203
Very much, yeah.

19:29.223 --> 19:34.968
It was the last Essex-class, but it had the hurricane bow, and they later put an angle deck on it.

19:35.228 --> 19:36.609
Yeah.

19:36.629 --> 19:37.690
And then it was the first ship.

19:38.007 --> 19:39.609
How many aircraft?

19:39.649 --> 19:40.530
About 85.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.193
It was always an attack carrier.

19:43.213 --> 19:51.443
In those days, they had attack carriers, and CBS, which is an anti-submarine kind of carrier.

19:51.903 --> 19:53.625
Now they're all carriers, I guess.

19:54.126 --> 20:00.093
Political correctness has come to the Navy now, so you can't discriminate one carrier.

20:00.273 --> 20:04.858
But I mean, there was a second-class kind of an aircraft carrier.

20:05.092 --> 20:08.095
which really didn't have the attack in the craft.

20:08.235 --> 20:12.378
We were a pretty good ship, actually.

20:12.398 --> 20:22.467
We were risking quite a bad fire in 1967, the year before I joined, which 47 people were killed.

20:22.487 --> 20:28.272
And the Enterprise had a forest all had a fire the next few years.

20:28.593 --> 20:34.558
Anyway, this to me was, I can't imagine my life without that experience.

20:35.348 --> 20:41.376
And I really feel badly for people like Bill Clinton, who's a year or two younger than I am, you know.

20:41.937 --> 20:49.347
I don't know what I would have done for him, but I'll tell you, if he ran for president 20 years ago, I wouldn't have voted for him.

20:49.367 --> 20:49.567
Right.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.289
I really would have held this against him.

20:51.550 --> 20:51.970
Right.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.054
Because he did dodge the draft, regardless.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.458
There are two ways around that.

20:58.159 --> 20:58.459
Right.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.802
I'm not asking you to comment on that.

21:00.822 --> 21:03.786
No, no, well, I mean...

21:05.504 --> 21:09.990
Well, I have met him, yes.

21:10.130 --> 21:17.460
I went to the White House, really, in May, before he went to Europe for the 50th anniversary of D-Day.

21:17.741 --> 21:31.680
He had little conference on people to advise him about D-Day and how it should be commemorated and what particular Europeans felt about his 50th anniversary.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.090
to make speeches in different countries.

21:34.110 --> 21:35.612
And he wanted a sense.

21:36.634 --> 21:41.401
Well, I must say, I think he's an impossible position.

21:41.421 --> 21:50.314
I mean, to belong to the war, to belong to the Vietnam generation under the draft doctrine, and indeed head of his country.

21:50.434 --> 22:00.469
And that would be the commander-in-chief of the forces, and in a position to send men off to die, you know, which is awfully hard when he was...

22:01.512 --> 22:08.199
But that's probably the first time that we've had a president who was... I just can't think of any other case.

22:08.219 --> 22:11.963
I mean, you always had to be a... Well, they all were up there.

22:12.203 --> 22:14.025
The Truman had been in the First World War.

22:14.145 --> 22:17.649
Eisenhower, of course.

22:17.769 --> 22:18.550
Nixon had been.

22:18.710 --> 22:19.691
He was a naval officer.

22:19.711 --> 22:20.672
He was a naval officer.

22:20.692 --> 22:21.713
Kennedy was a war hero.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.635
Kennedy was a war hero.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.199
John didn't get the Silver Star, but... Did he?

22:27.432 --> 22:28.013
political.

22:28.093 --> 22:31.377
I mean, he was in a flight, but he was in the service.

22:31.457 --> 22:33.680
Oh, right, yes.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.044
Ford was... Good question.

22:37.064 --> 22:37.985
I think he was in the Navy.

22:38.806 --> 22:39.567
Bush was a hero.

22:39.627 --> 22:41.390
Bush was a great hero, yes.

22:42.631 --> 22:45.895
This is the first non-military president, isn't it?

22:46.055 --> 22:53.385
That I can think of, but hasn't really... I mean, you could never be divorced in the old days, and you had to have been in the service.

22:54.025 --> 22:55.347
And of course, Reagan had been

22:55.664 --> 22:56.885
movie actor.

22:57.045 --> 22:58.887
Well, he never served in the military.

22:59.028 --> 23:02.051
No, because he was making warfare.

23:02.711 --> 23:05.714
But he's, you throw the book out with him on everything.

23:06.135 --> 23:06.475
Yeah, yeah.

23:08.277 --> 23:09.318
Geez, I'm losing my track.

23:09.358 --> 23:11.320
I hope you don't mind my jumping around here.

23:13.743 --> 23:15.425
There is a neck, and you have it.

23:16.145 --> 23:22.532
It's knowing what detail to use to make a readable book.

23:22.782 --> 23:30.590
Maybe it's instinctive or what, I don't know what it is, but you make your books very, very accessible, and yet you don't pander to your reader.

23:30.630 --> 23:35.276
You really do gather the information quite selectively.

23:35.296 --> 23:42.583
I mean, some people say that you have this fascinating arcania, I guess.

23:43.785 --> 23:44.345
I write.

23:44.726 --> 23:47.509
I have very regular routine.

23:47.949 --> 23:51.473
I get up at...

23:51.757 --> 24:02.688
I don't start very early, but I get up quite early and I sort of read papers and sort of potter about.

24:02.708 --> 24:12.317
I'm very slow in the morning, but about ten o'clock I sit down at my desk and then I'll stay there all day until seven.

24:13.658 --> 24:20.565
My wife and I have a sort of quick lunch and I sort of

24:21.203 --> 24:50.012
do kind of go into a mood and I find that as I go along I think the ideas come and I think it's very important to let the material you've got to have a lot of material and you've got to take notes and you've got to and I often sort of take you know I write little sketches to myself

24:50.448 --> 25:18.868
how i think it'll go um but i think that it is i think writing is a flowing process and that you've got to uh listen something you know something tells you i don't know what it is but i mean something tells you what you should be doing uh sometimes it's sometimes you know you've got to get to something and that is laborious uh and you rework it and you rewrite bits of it because you're trying to trying to get to the uh

25:19.203 --> 25:21.665
to the point that you know you've got to make.

25:22.866 --> 25:27.891
And getting there is a slog.

25:28.531 --> 25:35.457
But very often, and I think when it's best, it just sort of comes to you, and you can tell whether it's right or not.

25:36.298 --> 25:41.463
And then at the end of the day, the next morning, I usually reread the end bit of what I've done the day before.

25:41.483 --> 25:43.845
And if I think, well, that's all right, I can begin again.

25:43.885 --> 25:45.166
Then I go on.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.708
Sometimes I say, no, that's

25:48.228 --> 25:51.212
doesn't mean, and I rewrite the last page.

25:51.952 --> 25:55.497
And then, by rewriting the last page, I'll start again for the next day.

25:55.537 --> 25:57.359
Do you use a word processor?

25:57.439 --> 26:03.326
No, I do have a word processor, and I write journalism on a word processor.

26:03.686 --> 26:11.416
But I alternate between a pen and a very, very old, 40-year-old portable typewriter.

26:11.936 --> 26:15.080
And I think I write best on the typewriter.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.902
I think, because it's

26:17.371 --> 26:19.374
You can get quicker with a pen.

26:22.498 --> 26:29.827
And sometimes I'll stop, put the typewriter aside, and I'll write a bit with a pen, and then I'll type it back onto the typewriter.

26:29.847 --> 26:35.315
But I think the point about a typewriter is that it does produce something that looks like a printed page.

26:36.036 --> 26:43.365
And it's sharper, and you get good phrases, and you get good punctuation, and sentence length, and that sort of thing.

26:43.385 --> 26:46.990
You know, there have been studies, I think, here at MIT, as a matter of fact, that

26:47.645 --> 26:58.795
that indicate what you write on a word processor or a typewritten page reads differently on a screen.

26:59.495 --> 27:08.603
Assuming it's the same text, what you see reads differently on a screen than it might on a manuscript page and on a printed page.

27:08.623 --> 27:10.745
And I've noticed that all the time.

27:10.765 --> 27:15.589
I think you have to have this sense when you're writing, it's going to look differently when it's in print, isn't it?

27:15.610 --> 27:17.331
It's going to read differently in a sense.

27:17.986 --> 27:19.428
We notice this all the time.

27:19.448 --> 27:26.419
When you quote people totally accurately, they'll say, jeez, I know I said that, but it looks different from the way I said it.

27:26.459 --> 27:28.562
Have you ever read into that?

27:28.762 --> 27:33.549
Do you write on the web, Professor?

27:33.569 --> 27:34.230
Yeah, I do.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.592
I'm a journalist.

27:35.612 --> 27:46.609
Yes, but also you presumably are doing a lot of quoting from...

27:47.973 --> 27:49.915
And I'm doing ancient text.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.817
And a lot of inserts and stuff.

27:52.477 --> 27:52.818
Yes.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.340
It makes revision.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.122
It's a dream to revise.

27:57.142 --> 28:02.447
And the pagination, you don't have to retype the whole thing and re-paginate the manuscript.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.751
But I just, I write, I type very quickly.

28:06.891 --> 28:07.632
Oh, do you?

28:08.713 --> 28:10.255
I'm not a very good typist.

28:10.515 --> 28:13.778
I typed with four fingers on my...

28:14.922 --> 28:17.545
left hand and two fingers on my right hand.

28:17.986 --> 28:19.808
So I'm not a proper typist.

28:19.968 --> 28:26.957
I actually took a course in college, and I had to get permission, I mean, a typing course.

28:27.297 --> 28:29.299
I said, you know, I want to be a writer.

28:29.319 --> 28:30.841
I really could use this course.

28:31.842 --> 28:35.006
But I went to a liberalized college, and they said, listen, you can't take typing.

28:35.026 --> 28:36.969
I said, look, I can really use this.

28:37.029 --> 28:38.370
So they allowed me to take a type.

28:38.471 --> 28:40.773
It's one of the best things I've ever done.

28:40.793 --> 28:41.354
I can type.

28:41.434 --> 28:42.195
I can touch type.

28:42.614 --> 28:45.858
As quickly as, you know, almost as fast as I can think.

28:46.259 --> 28:46.559
Really?

28:46.860 --> 28:47.540
Yeah, I can do it.

28:47.641 --> 28:49.583
I can do 85, 90, you know.

28:49.763 --> 28:50.104
Great.

28:50.624 --> 28:52.988
I mean, my Lexington piece, I wrote it in 90 minutes.

28:53.068 --> 28:54.530
That was under deadline this week.

28:54.550 --> 28:54.830
Gosh.

28:54.890 --> 29:00.758
And it's a good, clean, accurate... I like to take a little more time usually than that.

29:00.778 --> 29:03.521
Yeah, but I'm a great believer in quick writing, too.

29:04.382 --> 29:12.553
When I write for the newspaper, I love them saying to me at midday, 1,200 words by 5 o'clock,

29:12.736 --> 29:14.879
It's very good for you.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.621
I love it.

29:16.961 --> 29:18.784
I respond to the Deadly.

29:19.124 --> 29:19.685
I really do.

29:19.705 --> 29:21.487
My best stuff comes in a Deadly.

29:22.649 --> 29:23.730
My wife gets furious.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.532
Do you review books as well?

29:25.773 --> 29:31.159
Yes, I review books from the New York Times periodically and other newspapers.

29:31.981 --> 29:37.868
The column that I do is a combination, which is why I'm able to market it.

29:38.088 --> 29:42.574
It does involve a little bit of a review and some criticism in there.

29:43.043 --> 29:47.609
And I work in these interviews.

29:49.231 --> 29:50.913
I'm sure you'll be pleased.

29:51.173 --> 29:57.341
I know I haven't asked you any timely questions, but I know you work.

30:01.045 --> 30:09.996
It is pretty interesting also when you point out all these sites where battles have been held repeatedly.

30:10.077 --> 30:11.159
through the centuries.

30:11.179 --> 30:13.021
Do you have an explanation for that?

30:13.883 --> 30:16.026
Yes, it's more than a coincidence, isn't it?

30:16.166 --> 30:23.757
I think that geography imposes on us more than we realize in all sorts of ways.

30:23.997 --> 30:31.448
In fact, I'm trying to do that in this book I'm writing about warfare in North America.

30:32.089 --> 30:38.278
The theme of the way American geography has

30:39.119 --> 30:47.692
direct channeled the inhabitants of North America into patterns of movement.

30:48.092 --> 30:49.935
That is very striking.

30:51.397 --> 31:08.923
For example, the British surrender, the end of the War of the Revolution, happens at Yorktown on the Virginia Peninsula in between the York and the James River.

31:09.983 --> 31:37.020
and the great abortive campaign of 1862 happens uh it actually begins at yorktown mcclellan lands at yorktown goes up to richmond and comes back to yorktown meanwhile of course there's a great revolutionary naval baton fought off yorktown between the merriac and the monitor out in hampton roads and uh yes and i mean uh

31:37.507 --> 31:41.391
I mean, the Revolutionary War is Yorktown.

31:42.752 --> 31:45.915
MacLellan's 1862 campaign is Yorktown.

31:46.135 --> 31:48.617
The Merrimack Monitor is just off Yorktown.

31:48.637 --> 31:49.618
And then I was reading.

31:50.499 --> 31:58.967
I mean, just last week, just before I came, I was doing something because I wanted to get something in about American air power.

31:59.347 --> 32:02.811
And I began to read a wonderful biography of the Wright brothers.

32:03.692 --> 32:07.395
And I knew they'd gone to the Outer Banks to Kitty Hall.

32:07.747 --> 32:20.865
Wilbur, you know how methodical the rights were, the most extraordinary thing.

32:20.885 --> 32:23.028
I mean, they are geniuses, it's no doubt.

32:23.468 --> 32:26.132
Incredible, but incredibly methodical.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.077
And they'd written to the U.S.

32:30.097 --> 32:33.822
Weather Bureau asking for a list of wind speeds all over the United States, and

32:34.291 --> 32:35.893
They had certain criteria.

32:35.913 --> 32:38.316
They didn't want to be a big city in place.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.979
People came and watched them.

32:40.999 --> 32:44.384
So Wilbur looked down on his stuff.

32:44.404 --> 32:48.148
He found the sixth windiest place in the United States.

32:48.169 --> 32:50.231
That was Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

32:52.053 --> 32:56.439
So he said that's... I mean, he knew it was miles from him.

32:56.779 --> 32:57.400
Nobody ever went to Kitty Hawk.

32:57.961 --> 33:02.847
He put all his stuff on a train in Dayton, Ohio.

33:03.637 --> 33:10.125
And he took it to Old Point Comfort, which is at Yorktown.

33:10.826 --> 33:14.050
This is coincidence.

33:14.952 --> 33:33.255
Well, I wonder, you know, I know maybe it is coincidence, but it's not coincidence that the British surrender happened at Yorktown, that the McClellan's campaign against Richmond, because the British got

33:33.640 --> 33:46.456
They were campaigning all over the side, and they got driven back beyond Richmond, whereas McLaren was trying to get at Richmond, and if you want to get at Richmond, you've really got to go to Yorktown, you know, if you're coming by water.

33:46.576 --> 33:47.357
I can see that.

33:47.718 --> 33:49.680
But maybe it was coincidence.

33:49.700 --> 33:53.485
But I thought, what an extraordinary coincidence.

33:53.505 --> 33:57.330
But you cite that one place in Turkey that has 15... Adrian Opal, yes.

33:57.350 --> 34:02.837
But there's a good reason for that, because the mountains and the sea...

34:03.155 --> 34:05.839
kind of make you go to Adrian.

34:07.241 --> 34:12.729
Is it still as fascinating a subject for you as it was when you were around?

34:12.749 --> 34:14.672
Well, I'm by myself, it is.

34:14.772 --> 34:17.336
I'm always thinking about it.

34:20.281 --> 34:31.137
I do find while I'm doing radiophonians, which I've just done one now with people, it seems to drive you back to

34:31.336 --> 34:52.737
I mean, you do get the politically correct lady who wants to say, how do you justify killing innocent people?

34:52.818 --> 34:55.100
You do tend to get these very reluctant questions.

34:55.121 --> 34:56.602
No, I don't.

34:56.622 --> 35:06.833
But then you say to her very carefully that I don't just let... And then she says, but you're killing... And there's a presumption that you condone this, but you don't.

35:07.454 --> 35:07.694
Right.

35:07.914 --> 35:10.117
I think that's a very important point.

35:10.137 --> 35:11.458
A criminological question.

35:12.159 --> 35:16.284
A criminologist is presumably somebody who approves of crime.

35:16.304 --> 35:17.164
Isn't that ridiculous?

35:17.525 --> 35:18.946
It's the old killing the messenger.

35:19.567 --> 35:20.428
Yes.

35:21.033 --> 35:25.761
I'm surprised some of these women don't ask you about why you don't deal with the Amazons.

35:27.945 --> 35:31.731
Yes, that would almost be a legitimate question.

35:31.751 --> 35:36.800
Yeah, they usually don't get me about that.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.584
So I think, what is your answer to that?

35:40.987 --> 35:44.172
My answer to that is probably not real.

35:44.793 --> 35:49.038
Do the women really want women to go?

35:49.238 --> 35:54.444
Were there, in fact, Amazons?

35:54.464 --> 35:55.766
A band of women warriors?

35:55.886 --> 35:58.209
I don't think so.

35:58.229 --> 36:02.214
It's mythic.

36:02.434 --> 36:03.715
I think that's probably the answer.

36:03.735 --> 36:11.104
You have nothing to support any of their... It really is a male-dominated...

36:11.692 --> 36:16.937
And you do believe that it is innate to the male?

36:17.217 --> 36:18.679
To the male, I think.

36:18.699 --> 36:19.840
And not to the women?

36:19.860 --> 36:24.584
No, I mean, clearly there's the odd, extremely tough and aggressive woman.

36:24.604 --> 36:31.751
I saw some... Don't the Israelis have women in their... Yeah, they don't let them... They don't let them.

36:31.771 --> 36:35.794
They're not supposed to go forward at brigade headquarters.

36:35.814 --> 36:38.577
But I was watching... I was up in...

36:40.480 --> 36:57.499
New Brown Street, New Jersey, the day before yesterday, and I was waiting for a car, so I turned the television on in my room, and, I mean, of course, American television is extraordinary, because you have 20 channels where... Nothing like any of them.

36:58.080 --> 37:07.210
But one of the channels was, um, the chat show, and they had eight women bodybuilders.

37:07.831 --> 37:08.952
Have you seen that?

37:10.028 --> 37:18.059
I mean, one of them, she kind of was a woman, but in every other respect, I mean, her face, a manner, she was a man.

37:19.601 --> 37:24.288
She was six foot two, and I wouldn't fool around with her either.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.252
That's funny.

37:27.272 --> 37:30.757
What can I ask you that, John?

37:30.777 --> 37:39.850
So your next book is, how do you respond to suggestions that you may romanticize?

37:40.049 --> 37:44.856
I do get asked that.

37:47.780 --> 37:48.921
I try and say I don't.

37:49.602 --> 37:55.411
At the same time, I'm forced to admit that there is something romantic about war.

37:55.531 --> 37:58.074
I mean, war is many, many things.

38:00.337 --> 38:09.330
There's no doubt that some young men, many young men, particularly before anything else that happens, do get

38:09.850 --> 38:15.755
I'm sure when you first went on your aircraft carrier, you felt quite a strong emotional surge.

38:15.975 --> 38:19.338
Well, I enjoyed getting an extra roll of ribbons.

38:19.438 --> 38:23.061
I had three rolls of ribbons, and I'm very proud of them.

38:23.322 --> 38:26.184
And I like my dress whites.

38:26.284 --> 38:26.604
Sure.

38:27.865 --> 38:39.115
You haven't read, it's not a widely published book, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful, a memoir of serving aboard a carrier.

38:39.753 --> 38:42.477
in the Second World War called Crossing the Line.

38:42.618 --> 38:44.000
It hasn't come to you, has it?

38:44.020 --> 38:44.681
No.

38:44.701 --> 38:45.582
It's quite new.

38:47.486 --> 38:55.859
What impressed me was that the foreword was written by Professor Lawrence Stone of Princeton, who's a British historian, as you know.

38:56.380 --> 39:00.126
And I know Lawrence.

39:00.166 --> 39:01.949
He wrote the most glowing introduction.

39:02.450 --> 39:06.857
He had been on an aircraft carrier as an aircraft control officer on a British aircraft.

39:08.035 --> 39:16.223
This is a man who's a friend of yours, who later became a professor of English literature at Princeton, I think.

39:16.243 --> 39:22.969
But who's the most unlikely professor of English literature you can imagine.

39:24.510 --> 39:37.502
He came off a dirt poor little ranch in Wyoming, and he joined the Navy as a ordinary seaman, apprentice seaman, seaman apprentice, before Pearl Harbor,

39:38.123 --> 39:42.627
Because it was a way of getting out of my energy.

39:42.647 --> 39:47.231
And he was then... I think that's true in a lot of cases.

39:47.251 --> 39:47.832
Is it?

39:47.852 --> 39:49.594
Yeah, I went to OCS.

39:49.674 --> 39:52.096
I would say half of my section was from Iowa.

39:52.817 --> 39:58.082
I mean, the first time Mike had ever seen the ocean was when he showed up to go to OCS.

39:58.322 --> 39:58.582
Right.

39:58.602 --> 40:03.687
You know, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised because the skipper of my ship was from Oklahoma.

40:03.807 --> 40:07.270
I mean, he was a terrific, he was a World War II pilot.

40:08.178 --> 40:14.465
I think he made it to Averill, and a lot of them are from Oklahoma, or the Midwest.

40:14.485 --> 40:18.190
There is a charm and an attraction to the allure of this.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.534
Where did you go to Wellsville Liberal Arts College?

40:21.574 --> 40:23.016
Bates College up in Maine.

40:23.236 --> 40:24.998
Oh, right, yes.

40:25.018 --> 40:26.620
A small college.

40:28.582 --> 40:33.929
Good liberal arts college of about a thousand students.

40:33.949 --> 40:36.311
And then I went to graduate school at Penn State.

40:36.572 --> 40:36.852
Oh, right.

40:37.692 --> 40:42.780
I lived in Washington and had a fellowship down there in journalism.

40:44.182 --> 40:45.645
Spent three years in those?

40:45.665 --> 40:45.985
Maybe.

40:46.145 --> 40:46.726
And I loved it.

40:47.087 --> 40:47.808
I loved it.

40:47.908 --> 40:48.309
Absolutely.

40:48.329 --> 40:52.155
It's one of the great—you're young, too, you know.

40:52.215 --> 40:55.641
It's amazing.

40:55.841 --> 41:01.470
I used to, for pleasure, go up and just watch those airplanes take off and land.

41:01.490 --> 41:04.695
Of course, I was an unrestricted line officer, so I—

41:05.063 --> 41:13.880
I stood my bridge watches, and I would have pecan and steer that ship into the wind and launch aircraft.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.465
I think I could still do it today, 25 years after.

41:16.685 --> 41:19.571
Could you know I could?

41:20.092 --> 41:27.105
I would remember everything, make sure the number three elevator is up, check the anemometer for the wind, give the commands to the

41:27.423 --> 41:29.306
signals to the task group.

41:29.346 --> 41:33.892
I think I could still give the proper sequence of legs, you know.

41:33.972 --> 41:34.753
It's very basic.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.016
You know, Corbin is a turret.

41:37.036 --> 41:40.240
You know, it's tough to know the sequence.

41:41.622 --> 41:43.385
And, you know, it's drilled.

41:44.466 --> 41:45.287
It was pretty exciting.

41:45.688 --> 41:50.895
It was pretty exciting to hear those airplanes flying that way.

41:50.915 --> 41:51.215
Yeah.

41:51.275 --> 41:54.520
Well, it is one of the wonders of the world, really.

41:54.540 --> 41:55.221
The aircraft.

41:55.621 --> 41:56.282
Do you think that

41:56.465 --> 42:00.812
It's flying off, landing on is more dramatic than flying off.

42:00.992 --> 42:03.676
Yeah, I've done them both.

42:03.696 --> 42:08.284
Oh, well, getting shot off is pretty exciting.

42:08.664 --> 42:09.385
Right.

42:09.405 --> 42:13.792
I mean, you do, it is 1.7 seconds from zero to... Right.

42:14.674 --> 42:23.147
They're going to get off the deck, whereas if they're landing on, you're not absolutely... Well, no, we have what's...

42:23.296 --> 42:25.219
How are we doing?

42:25.239 --> 42:26.420
Well, you have a reading.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.647
Yeah, my lady is coming to get me fairly soon.

42:31.727 --> 42:38.676
Okay, so I think I've asked you a lot of questions.

42:39.277 --> 42:43.963
Do walls work like the Great Wall of China, the Maginot line?

42:43.983 --> 42:48.409
They work better than the critics accuse them.

42:49.435 --> 42:53.999
I think the Great Wall of China, of course, because that was against Cavaliers.

42:54.360 --> 42:57.342
There's no line that didn't work.

42:58.243 --> 43:04.749
But the one place the Germans made an assault on it, they had a hell of a job.

43:06.170 --> 43:13.177
I think walls work better than they're driven credit for, really.

43:14.778 --> 43:18.902
The trouble with, they're like aircraft carriers, they're incredibly expensive.

43:19.439 --> 43:32.912
I think the investment probably never pays off, but they do.

43:35.235 --> 43:38.158
I think the Great Wall of China worked quite a lot of the time.

43:38.178 --> 43:41.821
I don't know about the carriers.

43:41.901 --> 43:44.704
I think the investment does pay off, if you want to.

43:44.724 --> 43:49.429
Yes, it does in carriers, but the thing is that what I meant was that the costs of

43:50.557 --> 43:52.600
The fortification had put it up to the car.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.220
Exactly.

43:53.240 --> 43:57.826
I mean, only one or two nations could build it in a craft carrier that you have.

43:57.846 --> 43:59.268
They've got billions of dollars.

44:00.029 --> 44:06.358
But what a thing to have, to be able to send a whole airfield a few miles off the coast to come place.

44:06.758 --> 44:09.742
You know, I mean, Saddam Hussein has to think twice, doesn't he?

44:09.762 --> 44:10.022
Absolutely.

44:10.843 --> 44:13.407
And you could have them there ready to go.

44:13.687 --> 44:14.388
Yes.

44:14.408 --> 44:15.630
They're really quite amazing.

44:15.710 --> 44:18.994
We used to say, you know, the nuclear...

44:19.514 --> 44:22.438
Our lifespan of nuclear war was that we were all targeted.

44:22.458 --> 44:27.504
Every time we crossed the Pacific, a Russian bear, a red bear would come down and pick us up.

44:27.524 --> 44:30.467
You know, just so we all knew it was a game.

44:30.487 --> 44:31.949
They were following us.

44:31.969 --> 44:33.631
There were submarines out there.

44:33.651 --> 44:37.796
And so if war was declared, you figure you've got a 10-minute lifespan.

44:38.858 --> 44:43.243
You've got maybe 20 minutes to get your aircraft with their weapons off.

44:43.747 --> 44:47.031
And that is, they say, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.

44:47.631 --> 44:50.735
That's about how much time you have left.

44:51.175 --> 44:56.601
It's a pretty exciting thing.

44:56.621 --> 44:59.784
I'm going to ask you to inscribe my copy of this book.

45:00.165 --> 45:02.087
I apologize for not asking more.

45:02.487 --> 45:04.309
I enjoyed it.

45:05.410 --> 45:10.716
While you're writing that, what would you say your most

45:11.708 --> 45:37.142
the book people ask you about always about the face of that really yeah always um and why why is that what you say because uh it makes it very personal because no it's not only that it's because uh something did some strange um

45:39.485 --> 45:42.528
I was on a strange mood to say to me when I wrote that book.

45:44.189 --> 45:49.053
I had, I mean, it was the first book I wrote.

45:49.654 --> 45:54.378
I was, I began writing it when I was, I began writing it in 1972 when I was 38.

45:54.678 --> 46:01.123
I got a sabbatical from Santos.

46:01.143 --> 46:09.070
I sat up, you know, I didn't write in his home, I sat up in a funny little windowless room in an old

46:09.387 --> 46:22.380
I did go into a sort of trance writing that book.

46:23.321 --> 46:25.303
I'd thought about it for a long, long time.

46:25.844 --> 46:30.529
And I always say it was sort of a book that wrote itself.

46:30.669 --> 46:33.412
I actually sort of kind of watched.

46:33.552 --> 46:36.795
I mean, I could watch it coming out on the page without my quite knowing

46:37.163 --> 46:47.235
It was a very extraordinary experience, and it has never happened to me again.

46:49.498 --> 46:51.881
Can you explain?

46:51.901 --> 46:53.363
I didn't know what it was.

46:53.383 --> 46:54.745
I didn't know what it was.

46:54.765 --> 46:59.070
What was it that you felt that you had to say?

46:59.894 --> 47:29.563
I don't know, but I think I was very much passing on the experience of people that I was with, these, they were a bit older than me, they were men in their early to middle forties who had all been young, regular officers in the Second World War, and I'd listened to them talking among themselves for years, so, you know,

47:30.185 --> 47:31.146
came years probably.

47:32.287 --> 47:38.032
And I felt that I was eavesdropping on secrets.

47:38.052 --> 47:40.014
And I had all these secrets.

47:41.415 --> 47:47.962
And when I was writing, it was sort of putting secrets together.

47:48.923 --> 47:59.112
Because, you know, you'd hear them, I'm sure you might, sort of in the wardroom on your aircraft carrier, you must have heard people saying, I mean, the sort of thing that you'd hear them saying was,

47:59.463 --> 48:00.585
I remember very well.

48:02.147 --> 48:06.053
Several of them had been in a battle in Tunisia in 1943.

48:10.379 --> 48:16.008
They'd advanced from Egypt, come across North Africa, and they'd got to Tunisia.

48:16.348 --> 48:22.016
And then Hitler sent, reinforced them to fight the Battle of Tunisia at a very high grade.

48:22.197 --> 48:27.765
He sent the Hermann Göring Parachute Commission and people like that.

48:27.982 --> 48:39.715
And I remember they were talking about that, and they were, one of them said, oh, yeah, poor little Gurkhas.

48:39.735 --> 48:43.219
They, of course, they got up against the Hellangaring, didn't they?

48:43.420 --> 48:48.025
And the people said, yes, they didn't know what was happening.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.027
The Germans started playing games.

48:51.509 --> 48:56.875
No, I mean, you have this image of the Gurkhas as the supreme sort of... That's right.

48:57.344 --> 48:59.326
warrior, warrior type.

48:59.346 --> 49:02.450
And they just, I thought, I actually did.

49:02.510 --> 49:05.333
I usually didn't ask persons, I just used to listen.

49:05.353 --> 49:06.755
I said, what do you mean?

49:06.775 --> 49:11.740
I mean, the Germans had them going, they couldn't get better.

49:12.361 --> 49:16.426
So they just started playing games with the Gherkens.

49:16.746 --> 49:22.913
And then, you know, poor little Gherkens, they did their best, but they just got completely, sort of,

49:24.479 --> 49:28.182
They didn't know which direction they were being attacked from.

49:29.063 --> 49:30.044
And it was that sort of thing.

49:30.844 --> 49:32.266
One other quick question.

49:32.346 --> 49:35.328
The lecture you gave is, do you need this kind of offer?

49:35.388 --> 49:36.709
Thank you.

49:36.769 --> 49:38.971
I've got a signing.

49:41.013 --> 49:42.794
Warfare past, present, and future.

49:42.815 --> 49:45.016
Just briefly, what do you say about the future?

49:45.036 --> 49:54.064
I mean, because it is almost... Oh, well, I really ended by saying that, I mean, the very problem at the moment is all these poor countries which are full of

49:54.635 --> 49:59.660
these cheap weapons and cheap kalashnikovs and stuff like that.

50:00.441 --> 50:05.927
You know, you turn the television on and you see 15-year-old boys with kalashnikovs who are mass murderers.

50:06.648 --> 50:10.432
And everybody says scandal, shock, horror.

50:10.572 --> 50:15.918
But you could actually, if you were business-like, you could stop them getting these.

50:15.938 --> 50:22.785
I think stopping the supply of cheap weapons to these crazy countries is really...

50:23.407 --> 50:26.571
a great path to the future.

50:26.591 --> 50:30.597
How about preventing them from getting hold of a nuclear weapon?

50:30.857 --> 50:33.120
Yes, that would be possible.

50:34.562 --> 50:36.425
I mean, that's entirely possible.

50:36.445 --> 50:36.885
That is.

50:36.905 --> 50:40.791
With the breakup of the Soviet air fire and all these out-of-work nuclear scientists.

50:41.492 --> 50:43.755
They know how to do this very well.

50:43.935 --> 50:46.819
And you have this stuff floating around out there.

50:47.159 --> 50:50.263
I mean, that's terrifying, isn't it?

50:50.344 --> 50:51.505
It is terrifying.

50:51.525 --> 50:52.907
What scares me is the nerve gases

50:53.360 --> 50:57.968
I mean, the way people, how easy it would be to pollute a water supply.

51:00.292 --> 51:00.473
Sure.

51:00.493 --> 51:04.119
Anyway, it will be with us.

51:04.139 --> 51:06.223
It will be with the human species.

51:06.243 --> 51:09.488
I'm afraid it's some time to come, yes.

51:09.508 --> 51:12.353
Thank you, sir.

51:12.414 --> 51:13.275
Thank you.
