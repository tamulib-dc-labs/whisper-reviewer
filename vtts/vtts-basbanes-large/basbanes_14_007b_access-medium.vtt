00:07.608 --> 00:13.235
Well, Scribner, Dave Randall used to sell rare books at Scribner's in New York.

00:13.255 --> 00:13.515
That's right.

00:13.536 --> 00:15.858
And then he wrote that book, Dukedom Large Enough.

00:16.299 --> 00:18.101
Exactly.

00:18.121 --> 00:19.924
Which you have a quote from right over there.

00:21.265 --> 00:26.192
You have that Shakespeare quote from The Tempest, which comes right after Dukedom Large Enough.

00:26.212 --> 00:29.135
At any rate, he tells the story.

00:29.175 --> 00:31.879
In those days, you know, they weren't selling books.

00:31.939 --> 00:34.442
People didn't queue up to buy books.

00:35.333 --> 00:47.465
He took a suitcase full of books and went to call on Hogan, who was a lawyer, and who had saved Mr. Doheny, whose library, his wife's library was auctioned in 87.

00:47.645 --> 00:49.087
From Tipar Dome.

00:49.107 --> 00:50.088
From Tipar Dome.

00:50.108 --> 00:53.411
He had saved Mr. Doheny from going to jail.

00:55.073 --> 01:01.339
And Mrs. Doheny sent him a book and told him that he ought to collect books.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.362
He was a very great trial lawyer.

01:05.101 --> 01:07.965
and President of the American Bar Association, etc.

01:08.887 --> 01:09.988
And he became a book collector.

01:11.611 --> 01:16.939
And Dave Randall called on him to sell him some books with a suitcase for him.

01:16.979 --> 01:17.520
He was busy.

01:19.082 --> 01:23.689
So he went into the men's room, Randall did, and was voiding.

01:25.091 --> 01:30.079
When the voice came over the speaker system, Mr. Hogan will now see Mr. Randall.

01:31.696 --> 01:32.517
He was so excited.

01:32.537 --> 01:33.358
This is the 30s.

01:33.378 --> 01:35.199
He couldn't find buyers.

01:35.820 --> 01:51.375
So he runs into Frank Hogan's office, and the first thing that Hogan says to him, Randall, I'm not accustomed to having men walk into my office when my secretary is sitting here with their fly open.

01:52.717 --> 01:56.040
That put Randall into terror.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.421
He began to butt his fly.

01:57.441 --> 01:58.342
He didn't know what to do.

01:59.443 --> 02:00.184
He said, what do you want?

02:00.367 --> 02:02.069
He said, I want to sell you some books, Mr. Hogan.

02:02.730 --> 02:03.611
He showed him a couple of books.

02:03.631 --> 02:04.892
He said, how much you want for this book?

02:06.374 --> 02:10.820
The guy, Scribner told him, so much.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.363
And he said, I'm not going to pay that.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.204
I'll pay so-and-so.

02:16.927 --> 02:19.069
And Randall says, OK, you're going to have for so-and-so.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.811
And they began their relationship.

02:22.453 --> 02:27.960
So when they became friends, Hogan said that he'd like him to see

02:28.700 --> 02:39.135
a Mark, a Huckleberry Finn manuscript that he had given to Georgetown, where he'd gone to school, the law school, nights.

02:40.718 --> 02:43.001
So he takes Dave Randall, Dave, I wanted to see it.

02:44.023 --> 02:57.222
They go over to the library, and he asked, Hogan asked the librarian where the manuscript is, and she says it's in the basement, section C, shelf four, gives him all the descriptions.

02:57.877 --> 03:09.616
So he and Randall go down, and they're lying on the floor, wrapped with a piece of twine, gathering dust, is this Huckleberry Finn manuscript.

03:11.479 --> 03:16.326
Whereupon Hogan turns to Randall and he says, Dave, that settles it.

03:16.346 --> 03:18.269
I was going to give my books to Georgetown.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.952
They're not going to Georgetown.

03:21.074 --> 03:25.521
They're going to be sold so that other people who can take care of them and love them like I do,

03:26.176 --> 03:26.757
will happen.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.679
That's exactly what he said in his will, too.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.883
He said it almost exactly in those words.

03:31.903 --> 03:32.224
That's it.

03:32.244 --> 03:33.546
He lived by what he said in his will.

03:35.849 --> 03:47.624
And that's why, in answer to your question, I would like someone else who loves books as much as I do and loves these books as much as I do, to have them, to take care of them.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.785
You know, I'm only a tenant.

03:49.026 --> 03:50.027
That's all any of us are.

03:50.167 --> 03:52.170
We're a short-term tenant.

03:52.450 --> 03:53.431
I have a lease on them.

03:53.491 --> 03:53.972
That's all.

03:54.779 --> 03:58.704
and let someone else enjoy them and preserve them, protect them.

03:59.264 --> 04:06.593
Now Alice and other librarians don't like when you say this because they feel that everything belongs in an institutional library.

04:06.994 --> 04:07.595
I don't agree.

04:07.995 --> 04:08.876
I don't agree.

04:09.657 --> 04:16.005
I think that institutional libraries can have much of this material without necessarily having fragile first editions.

04:16.125 --> 04:19.649
For example, I received a call from Warren Howell once.

04:21.031 --> 04:23.554
Would you like to buy a Burns

04:24.226 --> 04:25.968
in boards, in rappers.

04:27.089 --> 04:28.650
A very rare book in rappers.

04:29.651 --> 04:30.893
You know, the Kilmarnock Burns.

04:31.814 --> 04:32.434
Very rare.

04:32.474 --> 04:39.301
I have one in contemporary binding with the book plate of the patron of Burns.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.743
That should be pretty rare, too, actually.

04:40.763 --> 04:41.283
Yes, it is.

04:41.583 --> 04:41.844
It is.

04:42.184 --> 04:46.468
And with the book plate of Burns' patron.

04:46.488 --> 04:47.710
But rappers, I said, yes.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.833
They said, it'll cost, I know, $25,000 or something.

04:50.853 --> 04:52.174
I said, okay.

04:53.656 --> 04:59.104
Howell's calling me from New York, and I'm going to have this book.

04:59.124 --> 05:17.510
Apparently this book, along with a large number of other very fine books, was left to the University of Chicago by a man named Shaffner, who was a banker, retired investment banker, originally from Chicago, went, lived in San Francisco, bought a lot of stuff from Warren Howell.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.115
That's how Warren happened to know him and know the content of his library.

05:22.141 --> 05:27.869
And Warren says to me, it's now at the University of Chicago, but they don't need a book like that.

05:27.889 --> 05:29.191
That belongs to a collector.

05:29.271 --> 05:31.655
That's in wrappers, he said.

05:31.795 --> 05:35.280
And I think that they'll sell it for this amount.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.262
They could use the money.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.505
I said, you've got a deal.

05:39.947 --> 05:45.796
Well, Bob Rosenthal, God rest his soul, who might have said yes to Warren Howell, did not mean it.

05:47.558 --> 05:50.022
So I called up Bob, whom I knew.

05:50.947 --> 05:52.869
And I said, you're a walsher.

05:52.889 --> 05:54.912
I want that book.

05:54.932 --> 05:55.532
You don't need it.

05:55.553 --> 05:56.754
I was joking with him, of course.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.437
I says, you don't need it in the library.

05:59.457 --> 06:00.859
You can get any Kilmarnock.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.842
A book and wrappers belongs to a collector.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.224
I think so.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.246
And it doesn't belong to a library.

06:07.327 --> 06:09.149
You're not going to let anyone handle it.

06:09.709 --> 06:16.958
You may as well give it to someone like myself or sell it to someone and use the money for whatever you need to fund other purchasers.

06:17.559 --> 06:19.401
No, he wasn't going to sell it.

06:20.343 --> 06:26.530
He changed his mind, and Warren was sick about this, because he had plugged in a ten percent commission for himself, which was fine.

06:28.011 --> 06:36.260
But Rosenthal said, if you come down to the university, I will buy your lunch at the Quadriangle Club, and then I'll let you handle the book.

06:37.442 --> 06:39.884
That was my consolation prize.

06:40.084 --> 06:41.726
That was your consolation prize.

06:42.787 --> 06:44.029
That was my consolation prize.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.811
He was a good bookman.

06:45.971 --> 06:46.992
Yeah, he was.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.361
No, I'm talking about Rosenthal at the University of Chicago.

06:50.381 --> 06:51.483
Oh, how do you think about that?

06:51.503 --> 06:53.245
Oh, yeah, Randall did, and he made the Lilly.

06:54.306 --> 07:02.877
And, you know, even though he didn't have a librarian's degree in library science, Lilly said, either you hire Dave Randall or you don't get my books.

07:03.537 --> 07:16.253
So the university had to modify or ignore its rule that he would never, unless a person had, I think, a PhD at the very least, in library science or master's degree,

07:16.537 --> 07:20.543
They hired Randall, who didn't have any degree in him, to be the librarian.

07:20.603 --> 07:21.404
He was very good.

07:21.604 --> 07:21.704
Very.

07:21.724 --> 07:24.488
And then Bill Cagle out there is wonderful, too.

07:24.508 --> 07:25.309
You know Bill Cagle?

07:25.409 --> 07:26.231
He's quite a good guy.

07:26.251 --> 07:28.894
Yeah, I know Bill.

07:28.914 --> 07:32.720
I'm really looking forward to seeing your library in there.

07:32.740 --> 07:35.844
Any other questions you want to ask me about this room, or anything else?

07:36.325 --> 07:43.555
I think we've covered it, and there'll be other questions that come up as we go along, and I'll get them.

07:43.575 --> 07:43.675
Okay.

07:44.802 --> 07:47.165
of salivating about the books.

07:47.185 --> 07:48.427
It's just nothing, really.

07:48.787 --> 07:51.911
I mean, to me, it's hard to use with me.

07:51.931 --> 07:53.773
I'm opinionated, and look what it says here.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.677
I'm not always right, but I'm never wrong.

07:56.697 --> 07:57.618
Okay.

07:57.638 --> 07:59.120
I'm going to go sit at the throne.

07:59.140 --> 08:00.142
Look at this.

08:00.202 --> 08:01.543
It's marvelous.

08:01.583 --> 08:01.744
Okay.

08:04.046 --> 08:04.627
Yes, wow.

08:05.689 --> 08:07.210
I've got my glasses.

08:08.172 --> 08:08.752
Look at that.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.138
My God, I really do feel like I'm sitting in a

08:16.021 --> 08:17.723
Oh, Abel, this is really wonderful.

08:18.584 --> 08:20.666
Well, you want to start with some 15th century books?

08:20.686 --> 08:22.948
Oh, yeah, this is just... What would you like to see in the 15th?

08:22.968 --> 08:26.813
Let me, well, here, let me... This is really exciting.

08:27.774 --> 08:32.018
Here's a book I bought from... Who did I buy this book from?

08:32.038 --> 08:32.919
Oh, this is wonderful.

08:34.140 --> 08:39.826
I bought this from Larry Whitten, who is a great bookseller.

08:39.846 --> 08:41.148
This is the Cologne Chronicle.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.291
Go ahead, lay it down.

08:44.471 --> 08:45.032
Okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.736
That's a clam shell.

08:48.756 --> 08:57.806
And there's a mention here, the first mention of John Gutenberg, who had developed the process of printing from movable metal types.

08:57.826 --> 08:58.727
Take it out, take it out.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.247
Don't be afraid.

08:59.287 --> 09:00.369
It won't eat you.

09:00.569 --> 09:02.891
Look at this binding.

09:03.212 --> 09:03.993
Original pigskin.

09:05.374 --> 09:06.155
The clasps.

09:07.597 --> 09:11.661
Yeah, the boss isn't the clasps intact.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.449
Oh, my God.

09:23.017 --> 09:23.978
Oh, this is wonderful.

09:26.501 --> 09:27.542
Look at the binding.

09:33.890 --> 09:42.120
You really do get a feeling when you... That's what brings you into connection with the book, when you can handle it, look at it.

09:43.062 --> 09:44.444
Go ahead, take us through it.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.426
I am, I'm just, I want to start again.

09:46.446 --> 09:48.828
That's contemporary coloring, by the way.

09:49.549 --> 09:52.693
It's really quite, the binding is quite extraordinary.

09:53.654 --> 09:54.555
Where did this come from?

09:55.176 --> 09:55.796
Larry Whitney.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.619
I know, but prior to that, we don't know.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.881
I don't know what the provenance is.

10:00.842 --> 10:02.244
I'm just going to go to the colophon.

10:04.106 --> 10:05.107
Oh, look at this, see?

10:07.309 --> 10:10.673
Somebody actually did some, wrote some stuff in here, back here.

10:12.965 --> 10:15.869
Well, you're talking, I was thinking of the program.

10:16.310 --> 10:16.690
I know.

10:17.031 --> 10:32.171
I know, but I'm just... Now, when it's red, is that a second pass through the press, or is that hand colored, that red, would you say?

10:32.191 --> 10:33.073
It's done by hand.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.015
Yeah.

10:35.115 --> 10:36.577
You think all of this is done by hand?

10:36.638 --> 10:37.058
No, no, no.

10:37.138 --> 10:39.121
The rubrication, are you talking about the rubrication?

10:39.161 --> 10:39.902
That's right, yeah.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.825
The rubrication is usually done by hand.

10:41.905 --> 10:42.786
It is, okay.

10:46.867 --> 10:47.789
Go ahead and page through it.

10:47.809 --> 10:51.156
Look at some of the contemporary colored illustrations.

10:52.558 --> 10:52.899
Wow.

10:55.705 --> 10:58.971
Of course, I can't read the, this is German, right?

10:59.011 --> 10:59.452
Of course.

11:04.803 --> 11:05.745
It's magnificent.

11:06.045 --> 11:06.606
It really is.

11:06.646 --> 11:08.470
It's magnificent.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.131
But you only dream of owning a book like this.

11:15.712 --> 11:18.556
You only dream about owning a book like this, I suppose.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.941
Look at the gorgeous illustrations.

11:22.001 --> 11:25.446
I can't believe how tight it is, how tight the binding is.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.670
You're almost afraid to handle it.

11:28.790 --> 11:32.736
That book has survived for over 500 years.

11:32.796 --> 11:35.400
You don't have to worry about it.

11:37.042 --> 11:38.885
Has it been repaired over the years, do you think?

11:39.226 --> 11:40.107
Not to my knowledge.

11:40.327 --> 11:41.629
So that is the original

11:42.436 --> 11:44.378
to the best of my knowledge.

11:44.398 --> 11:44.698
Wow.

11:44.798 --> 11:46.820
And the way I look at it, it doesn't look like it.

11:47.161 --> 11:48.722
It looks like it has not been touched.

11:49.343 --> 11:52.926
Even the clasps are... The bosses of the clasps?

11:52.946 --> 11:53.146
Yeah.

11:55.188 --> 12:01.354
The bosses are these things here, and these are the clasps.

12:01.374 --> 12:02.736
You must look at the illustrations.

12:02.856 --> 12:03.957
That's where the beauty is.

12:04.037 --> 12:05.278
It's very coloring.

12:10.483 --> 12:12.325
And there's no foxing at all.

12:13.655 --> 12:15.417
What did we title this?

12:15.437 --> 12:19.103
This is the Cologne Chronicle.

12:19.143 --> 12:22.267
The Cologne Chronicle.

12:22.287 --> 12:23.789
The story of the history of the world.

12:23.809 --> 12:24.670
The history of the world.

12:26.032 --> 12:28.956
And it predates the Nuremberg Chronicle, I would assume, right?

12:29.757 --> 12:30.618
Nuremberg was 1493.

12:30.719 --> 12:30.939
Right.

12:31.039 --> 12:35.806
This is what the... I was looking for it.

12:35.906 --> 12:36.887
Doesn't it say that?

12:36.907 --> 12:38.469
But look at the coliform.

12:39.070 --> 12:39.811
I was looking for it.

12:39.851 --> 12:41.113
In the back I couldn't find it.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.023
I didn't think it predated it, but it could.

12:48.043 --> 12:49.004
What does the colophon say?

12:49.345 --> 12:50.226
I can't find it.

12:50.246 --> 12:58.557
This should be the colophon right here, right?

13:05.806 --> 13:07.168
Let me get my glasses.

13:23.078 --> 13:30.326
Is there any book at all, do you ever get like a hankering to hold a particular book?

13:30.346 --> 13:31.587
All of them.

13:31.607 --> 13:32.828
All of them.

13:32.848 --> 13:34.490
I get a hankering to hold them all.

13:34.510 --> 13:35.911
Now this is in a modern binding.

13:38.054 --> 13:39.295
It's the Katana copy.

13:39.315 --> 13:41.237
It's a fairly scarce book.

13:41.818 --> 13:47.564
It's the Dante, 1481, with the Landini commentary.

13:47.584 --> 13:52.849
And it has two illustrations after the most important

13:53.150 --> 13:55.332
illustrator of the 15th century.

14:00.819 --> 14:09.509
Now is this paper here, are these sheets more modern?

14:09.529 --> 14:10.930
They're new, obviously.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.832
When I say new, you know what I mean.

14:13.393 --> 14:22.043
So you see, this was printed within about 200 years of the actual writing of the poem.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.104
This was printed about 200 years of the actual writing.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.767
About 1250, wasn't it?

14:27.787 --> 14:28.989
This is 1481.

14:29.149 --> 14:31.813
Yeah, so it's 260 years or so.

14:33.595 --> 14:34.677
Oh, this is wonderful.

14:37.581 --> 14:49.157
Is it in the Tietzarima?

14:49.237 --> 14:51.861
It must be in the original.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.845
There are two.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.710
Two illustrations after Botticelli.

14:57.150 --> 15:02.078
There should be two.

15:02.459 --> 15:11.654
It's quite a rare book.

15:12.114 --> 15:12.956
I would think so.

15:13.336 --> 15:14.759
What is this, commentary here?

15:15.480 --> 15:19.907
Yeah, the Landini commentary to the poetry.

15:20.174 --> 15:23.457
But it has the original.

15:23.477 --> 15:24.058
There's the other.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.540
Did you see that other facet?

15:26.560 --> 15:27.281
No.

15:35.929 --> 15:37.871
There you go.

15:38.031 --> 15:38.732
Quite wonderful.

15:39.032 --> 15:39.793
You like it?

15:39.813 --> 15:40.473
Yeah.

15:40.553 --> 15:41.494
It's really thrilling.

15:41.714 --> 15:43.997
It was an important part of Renaissance.

15:44.397 --> 15:46.499
Yeah.

15:46.519 --> 15:47.700
Well, after all, this is

15:47.849 --> 15:49.150
coming out of the Middle Ages.

15:49.451 --> 15:50.492
And where was this printed?

15:51.172 --> 15:52.534
It was printed in Florence.

15:52.594 --> 15:52.994
Florence.

15:53.014 --> 15:54.796
So it's his home, Florence.

15:54.896 --> 15:55.837
It was done in Florence.

15:56.037 --> 15:56.237
Yeah.

15:56.337 --> 15:57.038
Firenze.

15:57.198 --> 15:57.899
Firenze.

15:57.939 --> 15:58.419
That's right.

16:00.021 --> 16:06.567
Here's another wonderful and suitable here, which I love.

16:07.949 --> 16:13.434
It's Plutarch.

16:13.534 --> 16:14.395
Plutarch's Lives.

16:14.955 --> 16:16.557
But what makes it particularly

16:16.756 --> 16:27.487
aside from the fact that it's an Intunable from 1478, is that it is printed by Jensen, who, as you know, is one of the great printers.

16:27.828 --> 16:28.889
There are two vowels to it.

16:29.409 --> 16:31.291
The binding is probably 18th century.

16:33.073 --> 16:35.075
Not contemporary, but 18th century.

16:35.095 --> 16:35.976
That is so pretty nice.

16:38.819 --> 16:42.223
So smooth, it was almost like... 18th century cat.

16:43.965 --> 16:45.126
Look at the marbling here.

16:46.405 --> 16:59.461
You feel the paper is... Well, then, Magnuson, listen to you.

16:59.481 --> 17:01.043
Aren't they beautiful?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.404
Look at those chapter headings.

17:02.805 --> 17:03.986
Look at those chapter headings.

17:05.808 --> 17:07.190
It could have been done yesterday, huh?

17:07.210 --> 17:07.550
Yeah.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.633
Just so beautifully illuminated.

17:09.653 --> 17:09.713
Oh.

17:10.134 --> 17:13.898
Oh, my God.

17:17.573 --> 17:20.837
And there are people who would strip these out of the books.

17:20.857 --> 17:21.258
Oh, yeah.

17:21.638 --> 17:21.738
Sure.

17:25.843 --> 17:31.350
That is, you talk about a treasure that's just kept between the covers of the book.

17:31.631 --> 17:36.477
As I told Bob, when Bob Cotner was here, I said to me, this is a typographic monument.

17:37.138 --> 17:41.243
It's more than a very important book, which it is in itself.

17:41.884 --> 17:43.766
Plutarch's lives being a very important part.

17:43.926 --> 17:46.129
And Shakespeare drew on Plutarch's lives.

17:46.379 --> 17:47.020
As you know.

17:47.140 --> 17:49.564
Very heavily, yeah.

17:49.584 --> 17:50.185
Very heavily.

17:51.306 --> 17:57.015
But it was printed by Jensen and beautifully illuminated, and I think that it makes it very special.

17:58.357 --> 18:01.020
Do we ever know who the illuminators are?

18:01.101 --> 18:04.526
Yes, I did know at one time, but I pleaded.

18:06.488 --> 18:09.353
But at least their names have been preserved someplace along the way.

18:13.018 --> 18:13.078
Oh.

18:14.442 --> 18:16.445
Each chapter is illuminated like that.

18:16.465 --> 18:18.748
If you page, you fan through the pages.

18:18.868 --> 18:19.869
I'm not going to fan.

18:20.991 --> 18:21.772
Fan through the pages.

18:21.792 --> 18:22.713
You get a feel.

18:22.773 --> 18:23.174
Don't worry.

18:23.194 --> 18:24.495
It's been here 500 years.

18:24.596 --> 18:25.637
It'll last.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.581
Oh, my God.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.083
You think of the paper they use.

18:30.103 --> 18:31.465
It's all linen those days.

18:31.565 --> 18:36.251
Today they've used wood pulp and the damn thing falls apart and turns.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.015
Well, people actually made paper.

18:39.115 --> 18:39.676
They were, they were.

18:39.856 --> 18:40.737
Oh, sure.

18:44.564 --> 18:47.108
You have to fan through them in order to get the picture.

18:47.509 --> 18:48.070
Okay.

18:49.492 --> 18:51.535
I hate to fan through.

18:51.555 --> 18:52.096
Look at this.

18:52.717 --> 18:56.383
That had to have been done by hand, wouldn't you think?

18:56.403 --> 18:56.824
Of course.

19:00.650 --> 19:03.995
There are other illuminations like that at the beginning of each chapter.

19:05.017 --> 19:06.960
Okay, I just have to be very careful.

19:12.779 --> 19:15.162
This must have been done for somebody very special, right?

19:15.363 --> 19:22.052
Somebody had, whoever this was done for, this was not something you could go in and buy at a bookstore.

19:22.072 --> 19:24.836
I mean, this had to be, I'm sure this was commissioned.

19:24.936 --> 19:25.116
Probably.

19:25.136 --> 19:26.899
I don't know the providence, but probably.

19:31.245 --> 19:32.647
There are other illuminations in there.

19:32.667 --> 19:38.014
I know I'm trying to find them without, forgive me for being cautious.

19:38.234 --> 19:38.635
Take your time.

19:42.293 --> 19:44.096
I can't believe the condition of this.

19:46.739 --> 19:48.982
I can't find that.

19:49.002 --> 19:51.786
What's the best way to fan this without hurting it?

19:51.847 --> 19:54.030
Just the way you'd fan any book.

19:55.231 --> 19:55.652
That's right.

19:56.032 --> 19:56.773
Like this, right?

19:57.494 --> 19:57.695
Mm-hmm.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.962
I want to see another one of those illuminations.

20:04.384 --> 20:05.586
There are other illuminations.

20:05.766 --> 20:06.768
Maybe they're in this volume.

20:08.470 --> 20:09.912
Yeah, perhaps they're in this volume.

20:09.932 --> 20:10.613
Look at this.

20:11.909 --> 20:14.513
In some cases, they're not printed.

20:14.793 --> 20:15.875
In some, they're not printed.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.036
You know, some people didn't do it.

20:17.877 --> 20:18.779
But I love that, too.

20:18.799 --> 20:21.222
But that tells you something as well, doesn't it?

20:25.928 --> 20:26.930
Isn't that something?

20:31.636 --> 20:34.621
You have to have patience to find these illuminations because they're there.

20:34.641 --> 20:38.726
See, many of them here, look at this volume, because it's easier to find them in this volume.

20:38.746 --> 20:40.308
There are about a dozen in each one.

20:40.729 --> 20:41.410
Look at this one.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.993
Venice, Jensen, January 2nd, 1478.

20:53.334 --> 21:02.864
Two volumes, folio, cap binding of the 18th century, gold fillets on sides, paneled backs, marble edges.

21:04.606 --> 21:06.047
It's absolutely magnificent.

21:06.287 --> 21:07.148
You're holding it right.

21:07.168 --> 21:08.650
I'm glad you're holding it as you do.

21:08.850 --> 21:09.170
Oh, I would.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.091
Protecting the covers.

21:10.211 --> 21:10.732
Oh, I would.

21:12.594 --> 21:16.238
It doesn't get you sick when you see people open a book.

21:18.340 --> 21:18.400
No.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.461
Makes you sick.

21:19.481 --> 21:21.464
It scares you and it terrifies you.

21:21.504 --> 21:23.486
I'm amazed you're trusting me with this.

21:23.506 --> 21:24.608
Well, you're a bookman.

21:28.072 --> 21:29.434
Oh, God, Abel.

21:33.820 --> 21:38.065
The infinite patience it must have taken to do something.

21:38.085 --> 21:38.946
Not to hand paint.

21:38.986 --> 21:40.388
They mix their own colors, you know.

21:40.655 --> 21:41.916
And that's real gold.

21:41.957 --> 21:42.757
Oh, sure.

21:42.918 --> 21:46.302
They use regular gold leaf and they mix their old colors.

21:46.422 --> 21:48.824
And the blue is usually a lapis that they crushed.

21:50.106 --> 21:52.589
Oh, look at that.

21:52.609 --> 21:53.169
It's absolutely magnificent.

21:53.189 --> 21:54.591
Absolutely magnificent.

21:54.611 --> 21:58.255
I will not be happy to look at least a half dozen of those illuminations.

21:58.275 --> 21:58.716
I know, I know.

21:58.756 --> 22:01.960
I just want to do this in a very careful manner.

22:03.181 --> 22:05.043
There are markers there that you can see.

22:05.103 --> 22:05.784
You see the markers?

22:05.804 --> 22:06.164
Oh, I see.

22:06.225 --> 22:06.505
Sure.

22:06.605 --> 22:07.005
Okay.

22:07.025 --> 22:07.506
That's...

22:10.507 --> 22:11.768
Oh, my God!

22:12.369 --> 22:12.890
Look at that.

22:28.768 --> 22:31.892
You know, this is a case in history where the first is the best.

22:32.232 --> 22:36.497
It is reputed, said to be the most beautiful,

22:37.456 --> 22:56.204
Pistachypnoidomarchy politically is reputed to be the most beautiful 15th-century book based on the typography, the illustrations, the paper, and the marriage of the paper, the typography, and the illustrations.

22:57.006 --> 22:58.788
And it was printed by whom?

22:59.750 --> 23:03.095
It was printed by Aldus in 1499.

23:03.535 --> 23:04.417
So this is an Aldean.

23:04.797 --> 23:05.218
Aldean.

23:05.671 --> 23:15.199
And it's the story of a monk who fell desperately in love with a woman that he couldn't fulfill his love.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.300
Obviously, right.

23:16.320 --> 23:26.029
And so in his frustration, he wrote this, allegedly, this book, which psychiatrists now buy the books because they think there's some deep psychoanalytic meanings to it.

23:26.609 --> 23:29.532
But it is a beautiful book.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.035
How many Aldeans do you have?

23:33.135 --> 23:35.577
You were saying earlier that Kim Brooker has

23:35.877 --> 23:37.419
arguably the finest.

23:37.439 --> 23:38.680
He's an all-dean collector.

23:38.860 --> 23:39.441
I am not.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.063
But you buy the things that you want.

23:41.383 --> 23:42.765
I buy whatever I want.

23:43.686 --> 23:45.207
I'm not an all-dean collector.

23:45.348 --> 23:46.108
Ah, but look at this.

23:46.709 --> 23:50.453
Now this is H-Y-P-N-E-R.

23:50.473 --> 23:51.815
Hypnermachia polyphily.

23:52.195 --> 23:53.016
I know, I just want to spell it.

23:53.036 --> 24:00.384
The love of the... Hypnermachia, M-A-C-H-I-A, P-O-L-I-P-H-I-L-I.

24:00.404 --> 24:01.986
The strife of love and a dream.

24:02.366 --> 24:03.808
Take off the sleeve.

24:05.999 --> 24:06.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.742
That's all right.

24:08.762 --> 24:10.443
This is done by the French binders.

24:10.463 --> 24:16.529
You know, they're always more, the French are always more elaborate than either the Germans or the English.

24:16.549 --> 24:20.914
Now, what's the date of this binding, would you say?

24:21.394 --> 24:22.195
What is the date?

24:22.215 --> 24:24.297
Yeah, I mean, not the date, but how old is this binding?

24:24.978 --> 24:26.179
Probably turn of the century.

24:26.319 --> 24:26.479
Yeah.

24:28.721 --> 24:34.106
It's quite wonderful.

24:34.127 --> 24:35.668
The French binders are, you know,

24:36.222 --> 24:48.418
The French, the difference in style is that the English like to leave this, there's in the original boards if they can, if it's a book that was published in boards, or can't.

24:48.438 --> 24:50.181
The French like everything rebound.

24:51.162 --> 24:56.529
What makes this supposedly the most beautiful book?

24:56.549 --> 25:00.795
Just the consensus of those who do printing and illustration,

25:01.417 --> 25:06.001
are the ones who believe that this is the most beautiful book that was printed in the fifteenth century.

25:07.022 --> 25:13.889
I would say that it is generally so acknowledged, not just by me, because I'm no authority on anything.

25:13.949 --> 25:16.011
Look at the woodpets.

25:21.256 --> 25:21.756
Wonderful.

25:26.941 --> 25:27.922
It's a beautiful label.

25:28.362 --> 25:31.305
It's really quite...

25:31.555 --> 25:33.517
the engravings.

25:33.537 --> 25:36.441
Is this something that Fleming calls and says he has?

25:36.822 --> 25:37.062
No.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.984
Is it something you say you're looking for?

25:39.024 --> 25:39.084
No.

25:39.265 --> 25:41.227
So how does it, what happens?

25:41.287 --> 25:45.873
I dropped in on a Friday afternoon and I said, what have you got for me?

25:45.893 --> 25:46.614
He says, look around.

25:46.634 --> 25:48.035
I looked around.

25:48.055 --> 25:52.120
He says, you know, Abel, you remind me of Blue Silver.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.163
And I said, why?

25:55.104 --> 25:57.908
He says, you have the same nose for books that he did.

25:58.488 --> 25:59.389
I wish that were true.

25:59.970 --> 26:01.512
I wish that what he said

26:02.015 --> 26:07.941
It had been true, because Silver had the most magnificent judgment when it came to books.

26:09.022 --> 26:14.767
As profane a man as he was, when he came to books, he was in a class by himself.

26:15.768 --> 26:21.474
But that was Fleming's way of flattering me, that I would pick the important books.

26:23.016 --> 26:27.320
And he never offered me a book, except the text, which I will show you later.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.881
Fleming never offered you a book.

26:28.901 --> 26:31.684
You know, he never called up and said, Abel, I've got this book.

26:32.204 --> 26:32.985
Are you interested?"

26:33.666 --> 26:35.228
He would say, well look around, see what you want.

26:36.109 --> 26:38.072
Did he call you if he hadn't heard from you in a while?

26:38.452 --> 26:39.093
No, never.

26:42.718 --> 26:44.500
Well, of course you probably kept in touch anyway.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.164
We weren't touched on a regular basis.

26:47.184 --> 26:54.694
But he wouldn't deign to call up a customer and tell them, you ought to come in, I've just— Because they haven't heard from you in a while.

26:55.175 --> 26:55.816
Not a word.

26:55.836 --> 26:59.641
You stopped collecting— If he had never heard from me, he would have just said goodbye.

27:00.302 --> 27:00.642
Really?

27:01.448 --> 27:11.300
And yet he was a good friend in his own fashion, faithful to me in his own fashion, as they say in Fair Lady.

27:13.162 --> 27:13.843
That's wonderful.

27:14.423 --> 27:15.845
I return this to your— Put the sleeve on.

27:16.226 --> 27:16.966
Put the sleeve on.

27:16.986 --> 27:17.367
Yes, sir.

27:18.949 --> 27:19.349
Yes, sir.

27:22.953 --> 27:25.937
You said you have a few books in manuscript, but clearly

27:26.390 --> 27:29.293
your primary interest is in printed books.

27:29.313 --> 27:29.854
Printed books.

27:30.314 --> 27:34.659
And you seem to have a particular taste for illustrated books as well.

27:36.021 --> 27:46.153
Of the 63 Intunables, about maybe 15 or 20 are illustrated.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.935
The others are not.

27:47.955 --> 27:49.556
They're just important books.

27:49.576 --> 27:53.101
Like with Lessing Rosenwald, everything had to be illustrated.

27:53.121 --> 27:54.422
Everything had to be illustrated.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.704
But again, you're more aquatic.

27:58.605 --> 27:59.726
I'm no Rosenwald.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.970
You're talking about... Oh, don't, don't, don't.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.452
No, he's a prince.

28:04.833 --> 28:06.014
You're talking about people.

28:07.195 --> 28:09.298
I'm just a little nobody.

28:10.339 --> 28:14.644
Rosenwald, Bradley Martin, Garden Limited.

28:14.845 --> 28:17.348
You're talking about another world altogether.

28:17.388 --> 28:22.374
For one thing, they collected when I wasn't even around.

28:23.675 --> 28:25.017
This is a fascinating book.

28:30.633 --> 28:31.614
I'll take this.

28:31.634 --> 28:31.814
Go ahead.

28:31.834 --> 28:32.334
Start again.

28:32.374 --> 28:33.435
Let me tell you what you said.

28:34.777 --> 28:39.080
Fleming originally had sold me the first, second, third, and fourth folios over a period of years.

28:40.742 --> 28:49.269
And my original first folio had, I don't know, seven or eight or nine leaves, in fact, similarly, including the title page and including the leaf of verses.

28:51.050 --> 28:54.053
It was a tall copy, however, and I always wanted this.

28:54.593 --> 28:56.315
And he always said, I'm not going to sell them to you.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.116
You mean this copy?

28:57.616 --> 28:58.136
These four.

28:58.176 --> 28:58.677
These four.

28:59.398 --> 28:59.998
Four folios.

29:00.518 --> 29:04.163
which he had purchased in 1961 at Sotheby's in London.

29:04.984 --> 29:10.673
He bought these four folios that you looked at in London in 1961.

29:12.656 --> 29:25.254
The first folio, of which they have an accurate record, had been owned by Alan Pulliston in 1744.

29:25.394 --> 29:28.939
Who owned it before, we do not know.

29:30.100 --> 29:42.433
Alan Pulliston married into John Dryden's family, and the first folio, which is what I'm talking about now, only the first folio, remained in John Dryden's family until 1913.

29:42.453 --> 29:43.334
Wow.

29:46.337 --> 29:53.704
In 1913, his signature, by the way, is at the back, pastedown, both Alan Pulliston and John Dryden.

29:54.745 --> 29:56.547
In 1913—

29:57.995 --> 29:59.997
In 1913... Excuse me.

30:02.941 --> 30:03.362
There it is.

30:03.462 --> 30:04.303
There it is, right there.

30:04.523 --> 30:04.884
I see it.

30:05.444 --> 30:06.045
Scored out.

30:06.946 --> 30:15.036
In 1913, they sold the first folio to Bernard Quaritch.

30:15.216 --> 30:15.557
Wow.

30:17.299 --> 30:20.563
Quaritch, in turn, he was also like Grosenbach.

30:20.583 --> 30:21.905
He didn't sell.

30:21.945 --> 30:26.871
You bought from him what you wanted if he had it and he was willing to give it to you.

30:27.678 --> 30:46.187
Roosevelt purchased it from Bernard Quaritch in 1913, then sold the book to a commodore Mortimer Plant, P-L-A-N-T, who was a very successful businessman in New York on Fifth Avenue.

30:47.890 --> 30:50.855
He was going to make a big collector out of Mortimer Plant.

30:54.220 --> 30:54.320
Okay?

30:54.541 --> 30:54.681
Mm-hmm.

30:54.965 --> 31:05.518
Mortimer Plant decided he didn't want to own any books, so he sold them back after a while, I don't know how many years, to Dr. Rosenbach.

31:07.701 --> 31:20.877
Rosenbach then sold the books to Frank Brewer Bemis in Boston, who was a great collector, as you know, probably one of the finest collectors we had during that period, who kept the books.

31:21.518 --> 31:23.841
He assembled the second, third, and fourth.

31:25.137 --> 31:31.004
He bought the first from Rosenbach, and then from Rosenbach bought the second, third, and fourth over a period of years.

31:31.905 --> 31:33.027
He died in 1935.

31:33.187 --> 31:41.097
Frank Brewer Beamster.

31:47.565 --> 31:53.052
He died in 1935.

31:53.504 --> 31:57.608
And now, of course, they would have been sending it to Sotheby's or Christie's.

31:57.628 --> 31:57.949
Oh, for sure.

31:57.969 --> 32:04.396
In those days, they sold it back to the dealer, who was, of course, Rosenbach.

32:04.416 --> 32:05.217
He had sold it to them.

32:05.277 --> 32:06.558
He bought it back in 1935.

32:06.638 --> 32:18.131
He then proceeded to sell, because now there are four folios, not just the first, because Bemis had assembled through Rosenbach the second, third, and fourth.

32:18.992 --> 32:20.413
He now proceeds to sell.

32:20.954 --> 32:21.975
I'll answer the door.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.031
I think that's there.

32:25.812 --> 32:30.598
To Morris Wolfe, who is the father of Edwin Wolfe II.

32:32.941 --> 32:44.717
Edwin Wolfe is then the manager of Rosenbach's.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.865
Edwin Wolfe is then the manager of Rosenbach's.

32:54.068 --> 33:09.394
I'll get the book.

33:21.575 --> 33:36.750
Okay.

33:38.953 --> 33:48.122
They are purchased at auction by John Fleming for Marjorie Newton, who is going to give them to Bryn Mawr.

33:50.178 --> 33:51.459
Or is it Carolyn Newton?

33:51.800 --> 33:52.901
Carolyn Newton.

33:52.921 --> 33:53.702
I'm sorry.

33:53.722 --> 33:54.182
You're right.

33:54.383 --> 33:56.405
It's Carolyn, not Marjorie.

33:56.425 --> 34:01.010
But as her brother Swiftie told me, she was a bitch of bitches, Swiftie Newton.

34:02.331 --> 34:09.039
And she has a fight with the people at Britmore and decides to sell them back to Fleming.

34:11.161 --> 34:18.649
Fleming keeps them for himself until he, out of necessity, is obliged to sell them because he

34:19.118 --> 34:21.464
needs to buy the apartment in which he has his business.

34:23.328 --> 34:26.316
So fortuitously, I was there at the right time.

34:26.376 --> 34:31.448
And I guess he remembers I'd nagged him so much about it.

34:33.554 --> 34:36.180
When you come back again, I will take you through some of the other.

34:36.260 --> 34:36.942
I would love to.

34:58.690 --> 35:04.579
I've got a marvelous copy of The Fairy Queen that you'll see and others here with great covenants.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.212
What time am I talking tomorrow?

35:14.133 --> 35:17.077
What time is the Caxton event tomorrow?

35:17.097 --> 35:22.285
I think it's what's the Caxton event, the Caxton Club event tomorrow is what time?

35:22.866 --> 35:26.011
We'll get together at 5 o'clock for cocktails.

35:26.411 --> 35:26.892
Oh, wonderful.

35:40.591 --> 35:44.038
I'm sorry I didn't feed you, give you anything to drink, but I wasn't going to do it.

35:44.139 --> 35:44.981
You nourished me.

35:46.023 --> 35:49.450
You fed me in ways that will last forever.

35:54.822 --> 35:56.305
Steve, I'll be right with you, okay?

36:12.738 --> 36:17.266
This is going to be a very rare book with the autograph of the author.

36:18.007 --> 36:21.414
Oh, come on.

36:21.434 --> 36:22.836
I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it.

36:23.938 --> 36:27.104
You're going to enjoy the next one, too, because you'll be in the next one.

36:27.164 --> 36:27.304
Really?

36:41.881 --> 37:10.015
My biggest depth is of the 18th century.

37:12.053 --> 37:15.537
You don't mind if I sign a nick?

37:15.557 --> 37:18.400
Put an X down.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.723
You're going to be signing a lot of them tomorrow, I suspect.

37:20.743 --> 37:21.344
My pleasure.

37:28.232 --> 37:31.956
The date today is the... Today is the... 14th.

37:31.976 --> 37:32.537
14th.

37:39.204 --> 37:39.765
I'm sure it's...

37:43.323 --> 37:44.685
Yeah, it's the 14th.

38:05.653 --> 38:06.394
Thank you, Abel.
