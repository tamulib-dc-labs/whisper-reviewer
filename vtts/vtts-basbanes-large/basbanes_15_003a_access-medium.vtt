00:02.157 --> 00:17.038
You say very early in the introduction that you wrote this as a kind of defense of the sonnets.

00:18.179 --> 00:19.401
I don't know if that's precise.

00:19.721 --> 00:26.691
You say straight away that the book is a defense in a way of the sonnets and the high value you place on them.

00:27.432 --> 00:31.658
My question is, does Shakespeare need a defense in this day and age?

00:32.043 --> 01:02.016
the lyric in itself this is not my perception alone it's been said many times by many people that the lyric has been considered a form that is not socially representative in the same way that the novel or the drama or even the non-fiction memoir is and the lyric has descended to us from a court culture of the Renaissance or a court culture of the Sabine Farm in Augusta and Rome if you want

01:02.603 --> 01:14.235
And it has never been a broadly populist form, as the novel was with the reading libraries and so forth, and with the bestsellers and so on.

01:14.736 --> 01:26.508
It seems to most people to be a more inaccessible form and one that is more hermetic to the ordinary reader than the latest novel.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.590
You're talking specifically about sonnets.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.712
No, I'm talking just about the lyric in general.

01:30.732 --> 01:30.852
Okay.

01:31.373 --> 01:32.374
And that it doesn't.

01:33.299 --> 01:40.626
The American lyric is a great and flourishing art, but it doesn't seem to have been grafted into the schools at all.

01:41.928 --> 02:02.648
Though the American short story has made it into the schools, some American plays have made it into the schools, but the schools have dropped the English lyric as they've dropped most of English literature, and they have not replaced it, you might say, by an equal grounding in Americans.

02:02.932 --> 02:11.282
literature, and when they do, literature has become more and more sociological as it's mediated to children.

02:12.183 --> 02:23.015
The lyric being the genre of the inner life is paid less attention to than a genre which seems more broadly representative of the social fabric.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.602
So the short answer is it does need a defense.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.497
Does this concern you?

02:32.018 --> 02:37.588
I don't mean to go off into the canonical debates, but nevertheless they're essential, I think.

02:39.310 --> 02:55.618
It doesn't matter what children read in school if what they read was written by real writers, but a lot of the children's literature and young adult literature is fabricated for a certain audience by commercial

02:56.054 --> 03:01.643
people, the way the romance, say, is fabricated for a certain female audience, by people who aren't real writers.

03:01.724 --> 03:15.747
They're writing to formula, out of a commercial desire, and they're writing without even much personal liberty when they adhere to whatever it might be, the spy novel, the techno novel, the romance novel.

03:16.749 --> 03:19.694
And the same is true of children and young adults' literature.

03:19.714 --> 03:20.475
A lot of it is

03:20.810 --> 03:30.102
deliberately confected to please certain constituencies rather than written by people like Sendak, who was a real writer, an imaginative writer.

03:30.722 --> 03:41.376
And to that extent, I feel that in America, imaginative literature as such has been kind of undone by a sort of sociological conflict for the children.

03:44.219 --> 03:45.661
We're at Harvard.

03:46.882 --> 03:49.045
Is Shakespeare a required

03:52.788 --> 03:54.531
thought at so many other places.

03:54.872 --> 03:55.072
I know.

03:55.092 --> 03:55.994
You can actually get it.

03:57.016 --> 04:06.313
Scott Turow told me that he was sitting at a table with, you don't mind my jumping around with questions, by the way, because I am going to write about, I promise, I'll write a poem about the science.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.014
Whatever you want to do.

04:07.034 --> 04:07.595
It's fine.

04:07.655 --> 04:08.096
Thank you.

04:08.697 --> 04:11.663
But I'm planning to use this for a number of things.

04:12.765 --> 04:16.652
But he was sitting at a table where the president of Amherst College was informed that they had just

04:17.864 --> 04:23.571
graduated summa cum laude, an English major who had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.877
Well, of course, Shakespeare was a very well-educated man, and he had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

04:29.598 --> 04:42.273
And it's not important to become well-educated that a specific thing be read, but it's important that what you read was written by real minds and real writers.

04:42.993 --> 04:47.719
I mean, you could certainly be very well-educated if you read nothing but Russian novels.

04:48.121 --> 04:57.292
You know, if you really sat down and read everything from Tolstoy through Stanislav Lem, you would be a cultivated person, whether you would read Shakespeare or not.

04:57.852 --> 05:15.853
If you sat down and you read all of French literature, from Ruiz Boeuf all the way up through Peggy, I mean, you would again, by reading Racine, Cornet, and Moliere, and Pascal, and Voltaire, and Dietrich Robert, you would be a very well-educated person, Proust, even if you hadn't read Shakespeare.

05:16.154 --> 05:16.474
I mean...

05:16.606 --> 05:18.930
There are many ways of becoming an educated person.

05:18.950 --> 05:28.245
My point is that to purport to be an English major, though, I'm not talking a literature major, but an English major.

05:28.285 --> 05:29.608
Call it something else, if you will.

05:29.628 --> 05:34.716
I would think that an English major, in a way, would not have to be required

05:35.725 --> 05:40.269
to read Shakespeare, but that something in an English major would make him seek out Shakespeare.

05:40.329 --> 05:41.650
It would seem so, wouldn't it?

05:41.670 --> 05:41.830
Yes.

05:42.811 --> 05:48.036
On the other hand, sometimes people are ruined for certain things in high school.

05:48.837 --> 05:58.886
If you've had a teacher who has taken you through Macbeth line by line and has taken eight weeks to do it instead of overnight, which is the way Macbeth should be read, read the play.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.267
It's overnight reading.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.690
Even if you told them the plot first so they

06:03.974 --> 06:06.897
wouldn't have too much trouble following the plot, and I'd say, now go home and read it.

06:07.538 --> 06:20.533
But they do it in such funny ways in high school where it gets so tedious that I could understand somebody thinking in his rebellious and adolescent way, never again Shakespeare, not for a long time, and doing other things.

06:21.194 --> 06:25.498
I just did an interview two hours ago with Margaret Drabble, who's in Boston.

06:25.518 --> 06:25.759
Oh, did you?

06:25.779 --> 06:28.682
Of course, she is about to embark on the next edition.

06:29.506 --> 06:31.308
of the Oxford Companion.

06:31.648 --> 06:34.772
So she actually is making canonical decisions here.

06:34.792 --> 06:39.417
And she says, of course, Sir Walter Raleigh will always be in the canon, even though nobody reads him.

06:39.477 --> 06:40.298
But he has to be there.

06:41.099 --> 06:44.142
And of course now she's thinking about who goes in.

06:44.182 --> 06:51.971
She said she was at a conference, and this high school teacher said it was really moaning because she had to teach Shakespeare.

06:53.052 --> 06:57.437
And she said, you know, the consensus was, here's a teacher who doesn't want it to happen.

06:57.653 --> 07:06.624
What is the student going to get out of this woman who is so angry that she has to teach a course in Shakespeare?

07:08.026 --> 07:10.088
That's not a question, I guess it's just a comment.

07:10.168 --> 07:27.289
Yes, well, after my son had no poetry in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade in private schools here in Boston, Cambridge, I finally said to his fifth grade teacher, do you ever do any poetry with the children?

07:28.197 --> 07:34.624
And she said, oh, if I said we're going to do poetry, they would all just say, ooh.

07:35.565 --> 07:37.787
Of course, that's because she thinks, ooh.

07:37.807 --> 07:38.067
That's right.

07:38.087 --> 07:40.250
Well, it's exactly the same sentence.

07:40.610 --> 07:40.850
So?

07:40.870 --> 07:47.497
154 sonnets with an essay on each one.

07:48.258 --> 07:50.000
An amazing undertaking.

07:51.502 --> 07:53.604
Well, I didn't intend it to be that.

07:53.924 --> 07:56.567
When I started, I was going to write a book on the sonnets.

07:57.307 --> 07:59.290
And I wrote chapter one and it had three sonnets.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.132
I wrote chapter two and it had three sonnets.

08:01.873 --> 08:06.680
Then I realized I was undertaking to write a fifty-one chapter book and that would not do.

08:06.740 --> 08:12.247
And yet I wanted to write about the lesser known poems as well as the best known.

08:12.828 --> 08:17.034
Most of the books on the sonnets are about the fifteen best known sonnets.

08:17.054 --> 08:27.027
But I was interested in each one because it's very interesting when a poet confines himself to a single form and does it over and over and over and over and over.

08:27.665 --> 08:32.893
And you have to find something new to do each time when the outer cage is the same.

08:33.814 --> 08:39.142
And so within the cage, you do very many interesting acrobatic jumps.

08:39.943 --> 08:44.309
And it's such a test of invention to do that.

08:45.391 --> 08:51.600
And I think no one has ever done it better than Shakespeare, including Petrarch or Dante or Monsard.

08:53.202 --> 08:56.727
Well, Keith didn't write that many sonnets, but if you write 154 of them,

08:58.192 --> 09:05.761
You really are put on your mettle to do something interesting inside the same form over and over and over and over, so they won't all sound alike.

09:06.462 --> 09:17.234
So I decided it would really be only fair to Shakespeare's inventiveness, of which he had more than anybody else, to talk about what he does in each one to make it interesting to him as a writer to do it.

09:17.735 --> 09:26.325
And you say that despite all the years that you spent as a critic of poetry, there are still

09:27.233 --> 09:30.958
There are still themes and aspects to the sonnets that elude you.

09:30.978 --> 09:31.659
Is that right?

09:31.859 --> 09:38.649
Yeah, there are ones where I think this is not interesting enough yet as a poem to me.

09:40.331 --> 09:45.458
And maybe there was something of interest to Shakespeare here in writing it that I'm not yet seeing.

09:46.379 --> 09:52.768
Because usually I think he did have something.

09:53.002 --> 09:54.924
jugglings in the air at once.

09:55.565 --> 10:03.234
And when I see only one thing maybe being done, I think, well, maybe I'm just not seeing the other four that are in this sonnet.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.717
I may see five things going on in this sonnet.

10:05.737 --> 10:10.763
If I only see one going on here, it strikes me that I'm probably deficient rather than that Shakespeare is.

10:11.845 --> 10:16.851
And there's no question that there's so many different things mindfully going on?

10:16.871 --> 10:17.171
Oh, yeah.

10:18.112 --> 10:22.097
No question in your mind that he had all these different

10:22.499 --> 10:24.161
planes of activity.

10:24.181 --> 10:33.491
No, because, I mean, I don't say that any more than a composer says, I think I will use a diminished seventh here.

10:33.751 --> 10:51.510
He just writes the music, but it's because he has such a repertoire of possible forking branches that he can take at any given moment of evolution of the work that he has the repertoire of the templates so much in his head that he can take

10:52.267 --> 10:58.034
this fork, and then that fork, and then this fork, and then that fork, and make the thing evolve in an interesting way.

10:58.435 --> 11:19.520
But it's done by instinct, but only after the ingestion of millions of bars of music before you start composing your own, all like Milton going down to Reed for seven years in his father's house after he had finished university to ingest all Hebrew and Latin and Greek.

11:19.621 --> 11:20.822
Milton did this?

11:21.427 --> 11:24.111
He just sat for seven years in his father's house and read.

11:24.131 --> 11:27.236
I'm doing a chapter on readers, people shaped by their reading.

11:27.256 --> 11:28.878
Oh, certainly Milton.

11:28.898 --> 11:43.360
And then Atwood said, not Atwood, this is Drabble, the two Margaret's, has just looked at Milton's daughters, who would have said, they read to him, but could they understand?

11:43.420 --> 11:48.548
It's accurate that they read by rote and probably didn't understand.

11:49.017 --> 11:51.980
And she said she rather doubts it.

11:52.300 --> 11:57.485
I think that they probably, if they didn't understand when they started, they certainly understood by the time they finished.

11:58.105 --> 12:09.875
After all, the vocabulary of Latin poetry is relatively narrow, and if you kept reading Latin to your father, you would eventually begin to know Latin.

12:09.895 --> 12:16.141
And then, of course, one of the daughters took the dictation for Paradise Lost, and she did a pretty decent job on it.

12:16.161 --> 12:18.383
Well, they had an amanuensis for that, too.

12:18.515 --> 12:20.478
Wasn't she the one for that?

12:21.139 --> 12:26.466
His nephew certainly did some of it, and he also had a hired amanuensis.

12:27.307 --> 12:33.235
I mean, you could get from Masson's biography of Milton, would tell you.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.840
William Riley Parker has a biography of Milton, too.

12:36.860 --> 12:37.020
William?

12:37.701 --> 12:38.542
Riley Parker.

12:45.652 --> 12:45.792
Okay.

12:45.812 --> 12:46.513
I understand I'm writing a

12:46.898 --> 13:05.937
a literary column here for about twenty-two newspapers, but general readers, but I'm largely in university towns, and so I can write about a book that discusses a great length of the sonnets, but I'm still writing for general readership.

13:06.477 --> 13:11.602
Explain to me what you would like a general reader to know about Shakespeare's sonnets.

13:13.044 --> 13:16.467
It's the same thing I would like a general reader to know about all poetry.

13:18.944 --> 13:48.748
most poetry has its power over us by what it does not with the theme but with the language in which it enacts the theme that is first of all a poem is not an essay it doesn't have a topic sentence which it then develops it is a constantly it's more like a piece of music it's a constantly evolving form taking new shapes as it goes along

13:49.505 --> 14:14.110
and has a temporal evolution, so that if the poet's mind is at point A when you begin, maybe at point B a quarter of the way through, maybe it'd be at point C, later on it may end up at point X, which isn't quite far away from point A. So that when people read poems as though they were statements, they are missing the true activity of poems, which is, as T.S.

14:14.130 --> 14:16.052
Eliot said, to cast the nerves

14:16.403 --> 14:17.864
in patterns on a screen.

14:18.945 --> 14:27.053
And so it's more like an EKG or an EEG, so that you see the nerves in patterns on a screen, as he put it, Prufrock.

14:28.094 --> 14:43.027
And if you think of a poem as a mobile, what Stevens called it, a mobile flickering between is and was, you won't see it as a static remark.

14:43.047 --> 14:43.828
That's one thing.

14:43.868 --> 14:46.410
The second thing is that the themes of lyric

14:47.133 --> 14:50.777
are really quite few and repeated through the ages.

14:52.098 --> 14:53.179
What is the highest good?

14:53.279 --> 14:54.421
Who is the happy man?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.323
I love you, do you love me?

14:56.823 --> 14:58.445
I am away from you and I am sad.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.807
Somebody has died and I feel bad.

15:01.949 --> 15:14.862
These are the static themes, the elegy, the love poem, the poem of prayer, the poem of praise, the poem of thanksgiving, the poem of metaphysical doubt,

15:15.398 --> 15:33.195
But there really aren't that many of these basic genres, and yet poets do them over and over and over and over, so that at least after your first run-through when you're young, you recognize that this is yet another poem saying X is dead, and I'm sorry.

15:33.896 --> 15:44.106
But the interesting thing is how it's being said this time, by contrast to how it was said the last time, and the originality lies in how it's said

15:44.643 --> 15:49.070
and why it's being said that way, rather than in what is said.

15:52.134 --> 15:53.597
That's excellent.

15:56.401 --> 15:57.983
I had two thoughts there.

15:58.003 --> 16:00.748
You have two thoughts and then you lose them both.

16:03.011 --> 16:03.852
Do you despair?

16:04.313 --> 16:07.358
I mean, are there poets today that you admire?

16:07.578 --> 16:08.159
Oh, and how?

16:08.860 --> 16:09.120
Yes.

16:09.221 --> 16:12.085
Are you despairable?

16:12.284 --> 16:17.692
That is to say, it seems to me that pattern making is never going to go out of style.

16:17.712 --> 16:19.675
It's part of our evolutionary deposit.

16:20.636 --> 16:35.358
And people are fascinated by patterns and by pattern making, whether they see patterns in nature like fractals, or whether they make patterns themselves in dances, or in music, or in words, or in anything.

16:37.361 --> 16:40.185
I mean, you can't not have a pattern.

16:40.205 --> 16:42.088
All architecture has a pattern.

16:42.980 --> 16:57.341
The patterns change, and if you look at the Bilbao, the Gary Bilbao, it certainly doesn't look like what the 19th century would have put up as a museum, but the shapes as they echo each other, the new Guggenheim and Bilbao that Gary just did, sorry.

16:58.603 --> 17:03.129
It's a recognizable collection of congruent shapes that relate to each other.

17:03.229 --> 17:11.181
It's a pattern, but it's not the boxy pattern of the 19th century art museum with its pediment and its columns.

17:11.937 --> 17:27.998
The reinvention of patterns, the recombination of patterns, all the combinatorial and permutational patterns that people make and do seem to me absolutely evolutionarily advantageous and therefore likely to remain.

17:28.038 --> 17:33.865
And so the people who are hardwired for words will do verbal patterning.

17:33.885 --> 17:36.369
People who are hardwired for sound will do musical patterning.

17:36.769 --> 17:39.733
People who are hardwired for volume will do architectural patterning.

17:40.439 --> 17:48.390
People who are hardwired for kinesthetic movement will do ballet or something, but I don't fear for the disappearance of any of these patterning forms.

17:48.410 --> 17:48.610
You don't.

17:49.411 --> 18:01.949
And so you don't enter this debate, which seems to me is getting less and less interesting as we go along about the future of the printed book as opposed to the computer.

18:02.950 --> 18:04.973
No, new art forms may spring up.

18:05.053 --> 18:05.974
I mean, video art.

18:06.663 --> 18:09.366
And you have a CD in this book, incidentally.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.927
I do, yes.

18:10.947 --> 18:13.570
Just because poems are meant to be heard as well as seen.

18:15.652 --> 18:20.477
But that's a feature that wasn't really possible with a printed book a few years ago.

18:20.517 --> 18:20.758
No.

18:21.318 --> 18:24.161
Or you might have been able to get a big 33 RPM record or something like that.

18:24.201 --> 18:25.182
Yes, that's true.

18:25.703 --> 18:27.144
But that really wouldn't have worked.

18:27.865 --> 18:34.712
Well, actually a 33, a third record was of John Ashbery reading Self-Portrait of a Convict's Mirror.

18:35.097 --> 18:40.882
It was included in a limited edition, beautiful fine press thing of self-portrait of the Convict's mirror.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.625
It was the Aryan Press in San Francisco that did it.

18:43.645 --> 18:45.547
I did the liner notes for the record.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.509
That's why I read it.

18:47.529 --> 18:48.310
That is interesting.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.271
How long ago might that have been?

18:51.152 --> 18:52.493
I'll check it out.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.176
It's at least fifteen years ago.

18:55.196 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, so you see all these things that happened before.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.002
You're talking about interactive books.

19:01.042 --> 19:04.665
Well, a pop-up book is an interactive book, and they've been around for five hundred years.

19:04.865 --> 19:05.626
That's right.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.849
And they flip through books and make the movement happen.

19:09.269 --> 19:11.252
There's little pictures in the corner.

19:11.272 --> 19:12.293
That's a very old one, too.

19:12.313 --> 19:12.993
Yeah, it really is.

19:13.934 --> 19:16.136
I was just at the Gutenberg Museum at Mines.

19:16.717 --> 19:17.558
Oh, lucky you.

19:17.638 --> 19:19.260
I've never been there.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.842
And I really didn't plan to go there.

19:21.882 --> 19:24.385
I was in Frankfurt to see the new… Oh, the book fair?

19:24.605 --> 19:27.748
No, I went ahead of the book fair to see the new library.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.570
I'm writing about libraries.

19:29.590 --> 19:31.412
This is the book I'm working on.

19:32.287 --> 19:36.672
I've been there, yes.

19:37.913 --> 19:42.018
Very interesting.

19:42.979 --> 19:44.180
And the new British Library?

19:44.220 --> 19:44.801
I've been there.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.003
And the new one in Frankfort.

19:47.023 --> 19:50.847
And there was just the new one in Stockholm, which was blasted out of the granite.

19:50.867 --> 19:51.008
Really?

19:51.468 --> 19:55.472
Well, it's the old one, but it still exists, but they blasted out of the granite.

19:55.492 --> 19:58.716
They went down five levels, a hundred thousand cubic yards

19:59.219 --> 20:01.662
Of course that's what we did here with the Piercy Library.

20:01.702 --> 20:02.543
That's the way to do it.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.765
Cornell just did the same thing.

20:04.825 --> 20:05.546
They went down.

20:06.347 --> 20:09.170
But I went to Frankfurt, which was there.

20:09.190 --> 20:17.819
But the various, you see, things, you know, that everything isn't, like you're pointing out, everything isn't revolutionary.

20:17.879 --> 20:22.864
There have been textures and nuances from the past.

20:23.941 --> 20:27.806
I think that the art sometimes moved from place to place.

20:28.347 --> 20:38.580
I mean, suddenly there was an explosion with Garcia Marquez and Cortázar and so forth in South America of the novel after a period of torpidity, more or less.

20:39.001 --> 20:41.143
Borges really began it and went on from there.

20:41.764 --> 20:43.326
Suddenly you have an exfoliation.

20:43.346 --> 20:53.880
It's astonishing the way you had with modernist American poetry, with Eliot Brown, Stevens, Frost Williams, whereas in England suddenly poetry had Auden and almost nobody else.

20:54.535 --> 21:02.067
Then later Larkin, suddenly there's an exfoliation in Northern Ireland, partly because there's an urgency there to have things said.

21:02.949 --> 21:05.593
So this rabble was saying today, Scotland all of a sudden.

21:05.613 --> 21:07.116
Scotland all of a sudden, yes.

21:07.136 --> 21:07.917
Like crazy.

21:07.937 --> 21:08.378
That's right.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.902
She said, I really have to pay attention to Scotland now.

21:11.503 --> 21:12.064
Exactly.

21:12.544 --> 21:19.716
But it's not that there are torpid moments, and I mean we can very well have a torpid moment in this art or that art here too.

21:20.708 --> 21:29.198
But there's a beautiful poem by Walt Whitman called Song of the Exposition, where he's entreating the muse to come to America.

21:29.659 --> 21:34.004
And he says, close up, please, those immensely overpaid accounts of Ionia and Greece.

21:34.665 --> 21:39.571
And then he announced at the end about the muse, she's here, installed him in the kitchenware.

21:40.272 --> 21:43.816
And so she's left Parnassus and Olympus, and she's here, installed him in the kitchenware.

21:44.196 --> 21:46.920
And that was Whitman declaring there would be an American literature.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.703
He was right, there was.

21:50.138 --> 22:02.097
Tell me if you mind talking a little bit about your biography, how you tend to be, how you came to be so involved in poetry, how you became a critic.

22:02.117 --> 22:03.439
And let me ask another question.

22:03.459 --> 22:05.342
Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures of you?

22:07.045 --> 22:09.368
Just the way you're sitting, the way you're gesturing.

22:09.388 --> 22:13.615
I do have some papers that say color pictures, if you don't mind.

22:13.983 --> 22:15.465
Go ahead and talk.

22:15.505 --> 22:16.406
Can I take a look at my face?

22:16.426 --> 22:17.368
Oh, you look lovely.

22:17.388 --> 22:17.828
Trust me.

22:17.888 --> 22:25.238
My wife edits every picture I send out.

22:25.458 --> 22:29.384
Oh, that's a nice little one, isn't it?

22:29.484 --> 22:31.567
This is contacts.

22:31.587 --> 22:32.608
This is really good.

22:33.209 --> 22:34.651
Is it a digital camera?

22:34.671 --> 22:35.071
No.

22:35.472 --> 22:36.593
They're no good.

22:36.613 --> 22:37.114
They're no good?

22:37.755 --> 22:38.556
No good.

22:39.700 --> 22:46.447
We were talking about my geography.

22:46.588 --> 22:50.712
I mean, I could say my parents were both interested in .

22:50.772 --> 22:51.073
.

22:52.634 --> 22:52.654
.

22:52.674 --> 22:53.896
Don't worry about me.

22:54.116 --> 22:58.421
I'm going to shoot some available light, which I love the light, and then maybe a couple of flashes.

22:58.741 --> 23:00.003
So you're just talking.

23:00.103 --> 23:02.185
I love the way your hands are moving, actually, so don't .

23:02.205 --> 23:02.225
.

23:02.245 --> 23:02.265
.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.511
Well, my mother was interested in poetry.

23:06.192 --> 23:14.644
My father taught Romance languages, and he taught us poetry, and he gave us poems to read in Spanish, French, and Italian.

23:15.505 --> 23:23.796
And I was also brought up a Roman Catholic, and we sang Latin hymns a lot, and we sang the Latin liturgy at the school I was at.

23:23.996 --> 23:25.098
And where was this?

23:25.238 --> 23:25.999
Here in Boston.

23:26.019 --> 23:27.100
Oh, so you're a native?

23:27.241 --> 23:28.202
I'm a native, yes.

23:28.222 --> 23:28.362
Really?

23:28.382 --> 23:29.704
Yes, I grew up in Jamaica Plain.

23:30.685 --> 23:31.206
I didn't know that.

23:32.789 --> 23:46.252
My father taught at English high school, and my mother had been a primary school teacher, but she couldn't teach after she was married because they forbade married women to teach in those days because she would be taking bread out of her breadwinner's mouth.

23:46.272 --> 23:52.823
So my mother, after 14 years, lost her job of teaching when she married, which was very...

23:53.984 --> 23:59.611
But my mother read a lot of poetry and knew a lot of poetry by Howard.

24:00.632 --> 24:04.877
But it didn't take on my two siblings, but it took on me.

24:06.159 --> 24:08.462
It's partly nature and partly nurture, I guess.

24:08.562 --> 24:10.284
Are you older siblings?

24:10.304 --> 24:11.966
I have an older sister and a younger brother.

24:13.688 --> 24:19.215
And so you went to college, planning to be a teacher?

24:19.499 --> 24:21.421
Did you plan to be a poet, or did you plan to be a critic?

24:21.441 --> 24:27.268
Well, I wrote poetry for years, but I didn't know why my poetry just satisfied me.

24:28.290 --> 24:34.397
Later, of course, I mean, I could only know it later, that my mind is really analytical rather than imaginative.

24:35.138 --> 24:40.805
But, I mean, my poems were all, you might say, technically correct, and they all had something to say, but I knew there was something wrong.

24:41.365 --> 24:45.570
And they were more the poetry of statements than the poetry of waywardness.

24:45.590 --> 24:49.455
I mean, being led by the imagination is wayward.

24:49.756 --> 24:53.159
And being led by thought is expository.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.965
But I really had never written anything that satisfied me until I did my PhD dissertation.

25:00.005 --> 25:02.247
And then for the first time I found that was right.

25:03.649 --> 25:05.390
And what was the subject?

25:05.410 --> 25:07.392
The dissertation was on Yeats.

25:07.872 --> 25:18.362
And I wanted to write on the poems, but I knew I was too young and that he had experiences that were so far beyond my own and really inconceivable to me.

25:18.950 --> 25:19.791
As a young girl.

25:20.712 --> 25:21.874
Now, this is a Ph.D.

25:21.894 --> 25:22.395
candidate.

25:22.415 --> 25:22.495
Yes.

25:22.515 --> 25:23.136
You were too young.

25:24.117 --> 25:29.064
Well, I wrote the chapter, I wrote the paper that became the central chapter of the dissertation when I was 23.

25:30.345 --> 25:39.197
And when you're writing on stuff that somebody's written between 60 and 70, you know there's a gap in experience that's almost too great to be bridged.

25:40.279 --> 25:44.965
But just, I'm thinking now of Sendak, for instance, who has a death mask.

25:45.306 --> 25:46.788
And you said you have a life mask.

25:47.088 --> 25:47.168
Yes.

25:47.958 --> 25:55.147
He says he gets up every day and he strokes this face and he says, how did this boy of 22 know so much?

25:56.468 --> 25:59.231
Well, he had six people die on him, of course, Keith did.

25:59.291 --> 26:06.160
I mean, his mother, his father, his grandmother, his grandfather, his little brother, Edward, who died at two and a half, and his brother, Tom, who died at 18.

26:06.620 --> 26:14.910
And if you have that sort of devastation hit you, I think you know a lot more about life than I knew when I was 23.

26:16.426 --> 26:25.296
So, to go back to your statement about Milton, who after college, immersing himself, you said seven years?

26:26.217 --> 26:30.522
So it truly is a commencement then, isn't it?

26:30.542 --> 26:30.763
Yes, yes.

26:30.783 --> 26:38.512
So tell me a little bit about, you said you weren't ready then, what did you do to prepare yourself after that?

26:38.852 --> 26:43.277
Well, I lived, among other things.

26:44.557 --> 26:53.470
I didn't feel ready to write on Shakespeare, though I had known these poems since I was fifteen, until I was in my late fifties.

26:54.091 --> 27:00.899
And I used to amuse my colleagues at BU by going around and wringing my hands, saying, I wish I could teach Shakespeare.

27:00.919 --> 27:04.664
And they would say, Helen, you know perfectly right if you teach Shakespeare whenever you want.

27:04.744 --> 27:05.445
I said, no, no, no.

27:05.926 --> 27:06.647
That's not what I mean.

27:08.309 --> 27:08.509
Yes.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.633
Finally, I'm ready to teach Shakespeare.

27:12.274 --> 27:16.118
Now, why is it that they could teach Shakespeare and that you couldn't?

27:16.278 --> 27:17.540
Undoubtedly, you could teach it.

27:18.561 --> 27:20.003
But you're telling me something in a different way.

27:20.163 --> 27:23.187
I didn't understand it well enough in my own mind to teach it yet.

27:23.723 --> 27:29.872
Because, I mean, I could see that these poems were wonderful, but I didn't know why yet.

27:29.892 --> 27:34.178
And we're strictly talking about the sonnets now, and not the plays.

27:34.198 --> 27:35.300
No, I've never taught the plays.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.401
And why is that?

27:36.421 --> 27:37.122
It's poetry.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.324
Because I'm not worthy.

27:38.885 --> 27:39.886
Oh, stop!

27:40.447 --> 27:41.208
I don't understand.

27:41.228 --> 27:42.790
I've never devoted enough time to them.

27:43.291 --> 27:51.142
I mean, you would have to devote many, many years even to begin to understand those plays, and to understand the mind out of which they came.

27:51.242 --> 27:53.005
I was trying to understand Shakespeare's mind.

27:53.407 --> 27:54.588
basically in his thirties.

27:55.649 --> 27:59.353
And that's different from understanding his mind in his fifties, you know.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.556
And this is something we really haven't discussed.

28:03.578 --> 28:08.163
Do you accept that the sonnets were kind of five-finger exercises for him?

28:08.183 --> 28:10.105
Oh, they're by no means five-finger exercises.

28:10.946 --> 28:23.059
I mean, he had already, if we were to judge by at least some of the correspondence, he had already written Henry IV, Part I. He had already written The Merchant of Venice, probably.

28:23.562 --> 28:30.652
He had already written certainly Les Labor's Lost and Romeo and Juliet and the early history plays.

28:31.072 --> 28:35.318
So these are by no means by an apprentice.

28:35.338 --> 28:39.404
These are by somebody who is already writing the great plays.

28:39.924 --> 28:43.349
But they weren't meant to really be read by anybody, do you think?

28:43.369 --> 28:44.170
Do you agree with that?

28:44.875 --> 28:47.720
I don't think any poems are meant to be read by anybody.

28:47.740 --> 28:50.745
That is to say, any poems are meant to be read by anybody.

28:50.765 --> 28:53.529
That is to say, that's not the reason for which poems are written.

28:54.030 --> 29:02.004
They're written because the person is compelled to write by whatever genius makes you compelled to do anything.

29:02.905 --> 29:09.516
And then they are written to satisfy yourself until they click and everything's in its place.

29:10.171 --> 29:11.172
You're not satisfied.

29:11.212 --> 29:15.157
You tinker, as you can tell from the revisions poets do, tinker and tinker and tinker.

29:16.399 --> 29:21.626
I was just showing my students the draft of The Eve of St.

29:21.646 --> 29:24.409
Agnes, which we have over here in the Houghton Library.

29:24.589 --> 29:29.275
You wouldn't believe the amount of tinkering Keith has done, but make it right.

29:30.076 --> 29:35.483
So until it's right, it's only right when you are satisfied with it.

29:36.264 --> 29:39.368
It's not for some other people out there.

29:39.922 --> 29:41.364
It's to make the right thing.

29:42.305 --> 29:55.663
What do you feel, and if you don't mind my jumping around, because you have this unbelievable collection of Keats material at the Houghton Library, do you go over there often and handle these?

29:55.683 --> 29:57.726
Well, you don't have to handle them.

29:57.746 --> 30:01.430
In the first place, there's a facsimile of all the poetic manuscripts.

30:02.131 --> 30:07.178
I wouldn't have to handle a manuscript unless it were necessary, first of all, because they're so

30:07.546 --> 30:08.767
And it isn't necessary.

30:09.208 --> 30:19.320
I've never handled the Keats manuscripts myself, although I wrote on Keats and did the introduction for the facsimile edition.

30:19.800 --> 30:25.227
But you have to really have a reason to handle those real things.

30:25.247 --> 30:28.190
If you're an editor, you would have to handle them.

30:28.330 --> 30:29.031
I take them out.

30:29.787 --> 30:45.923
for the students when I teach Keats, in order to show them the first editions, and to show them we had Keats's inscribed edition of his poems, inscribed to Fanny Braun, this JK to FB, over there yesterday.

30:46.426 --> 30:48.049
We had all the first editions.

30:48.069 --> 30:54.339
We had George Eliot's copy of Keats' poems, Matthew Arnold's copy of Keats' poems, just so they could see association copies.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.542
I did have some of the manuscripts out.

30:56.583 --> 31:05.257
I had the manuscript on first looking into Chapman's homework, and I had one of his letters so he could see the crossed letters when they wrote this direction.

31:05.277 --> 31:06.699
What students are these?

31:06.759 --> 31:07.701
He's my freshman.

31:08.141 --> 31:08.522
Really?

31:08.542 --> 31:10.425
I'm teaching a freshman seminar in Keats, yeah.

31:10.928 --> 31:13.732
So special collections really are useful.

31:13.752 --> 31:16.937
Oh, they're encouraging us always to bring our students over.

31:16.977 --> 31:20.523
I always bring my students there, the seminars.

31:20.543 --> 31:22.245
I mean, it's groups that are small enough to bring.

31:22.265 --> 31:26.652
And what does access or exposure to this material, do you think, give a student?

31:27.794 --> 31:36.046
Well, first of all, it gives them the vocab to a tiny extent, the limited vocabulary of bibliographical description.

31:36.607 --> 31:37.969
So I show them the facsimiles.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.872
I tell them this is a diplomatic transcript.

31:40.105 --> 31:45.810
So everything is there on the printed page that is there on the manuscript crossed out and so forth.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.692
They learn what a transcript is.

31:47.792 --> 31:52.276
They learn what a first edition, a 19th century first edition might look like.

31:52.737 --> 32:07.210
I took out Chapman's Homer in a Renaissance edition so that Keats would have seen the prestige associated in those great Renaissance books with the frontispices and the commentatory verses and the panegyrics.

32:07.628 --> 32:10.692
epigraphs, so they see the way books used to be done.

32:12.334 --> 32:18.683
They could see the rapidity with which Keats wrote his letters just dashed off like this and then dashed all across.

32:19.124 --> 32:20.686
They could see the rapidity of his mind.

32:20.706 --> 32:21.887
They're brilliant letters, though.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.069
Yes, they could see.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.252
The mind is still working even at speed.

32:25.272 --> 32:30.119
All the time, high speed, which is useful for them to know about the rapidity and fluidity of genius.

32:31.180 --> 32:35.506
I showed them his Shakespeare, which we have in little volumes.

32:35.646 --> 32:36.387
Keats and Shakespeare.

32:36.822 --> 32:40.906
I'd faint if I handled that anyway.

32:40.926 --> 32:41.747
Well, it is to faint.

32:42.247 --> 32:44.509
It's Dr. Johnson's edition of Shakespeare.

32:44.970 --> 32:49.634
And after each play, Dr. Johnson has a little evaluative judgment of the play.

32:49.654 --> 32:54.139
And some of them drive Keith's mad, and he X's them out with big X's or scribbles over them.

32:54.619 --> 33:02.847
And then he writes down blockhead, or man dressed in a little brief authority, or proud, proud, proud, or is criticism a true thing?

33:06.117 --> 33:07.058
these adaptations?

33:07.539 --> 33:08.060
I don't know.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.021
Are they worth it?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.164
They're not enough of them in the Shakespeare.

33:11.505 --> 33:15.571
But what is interesting, they are now, I've noticed they've just made photocopies.

33:17.293 --> 33:20.979
But the lines that Keats marked, I think, are intensely interesting.

33:21.499 --> 33:29.871
As when I saw his Paradise Lost in the Keats House in Hampstead, his underlinings are of two sorts.

33:30.452 --> 33:35.820
He underlines everything in Genesis about growth, beauty, generations, sprouting,

33:36.222 --> 33:45.152
You know, greenness and fullness and gourds, the gourds from the Otu Anand come from Genesis.

33:45.942 --> 33:58.015
And then the other thing he underlines is the long prophecy of all the ills, the angel's prophecy to Adam, Adam sees in the trance, all the ills that humanity will be heir to on account of the fall.

33:58.416 --> 34:02.720
He underlines all this stuff about Lazar houses and sickness and mortality.

34:03.001 --> 34:10.589
So the two poles that keeps the imagination, the generative pole and the melancholy pole, are all there in his underlining Milton.

34:10.609 --> 34:11.630
That's wonderful.

34:11.690 --> 34:14.413
You are absolutely excited by this.

34:14.765 --> 34:15.826
It doesn't bore you at all.

34:15.846 --> 34:16.206
Oh, no, no.

34:16.226 --> 34:17.948
It has lost none of its magic for you.

34:17.988 --> 34:19.169
No, no, no.

34:19.189 --> 34:25.975
No, I live, but the only thing it loses... You live for what?

34:25.995 --> 34:28.117
I live through language.

34:29.698 --> 34:43.810
And the thing is, the great artists of language never lose their charm, whether it's Milton or Keith or anybody else.

34:44.245 --> 34:52.634
There's also a sense that you have had that taste of self-worth through language that Copkin says is as distinctive as alam on the tongue.

34:53.395 --> 34:56.118
And you know what the mild taste is.

34:56.158 --> 34:57.539
You know what the Keith's taste is.

34:58.661 --> 35:12.936
And so another thirst that needs to be slaked is a new taste, which is why I read contemporary poetry, because it's the only way you can have the same sensation of newness that you first had when you came across Keith's art.

35:13.591 --> 35:24.368
or anybody else, or Hopkinson, that, oh, I think cloning oneself in one's style is what poets are meant to do.

35:25.489 --> 35:31.058
So that you say, oh, yes, that's Tennyson, that's Keats, that's Milton, that you know them from their style.

35:31.499 --> 35:32.300
That's who they are.

35:32.901 --> 35:40.032
Do you agree that each generation, you know, for instance, we say that each generation should have a new Shakespeare or a new Dante?

35:40.152 --> 35:41.995
We should be so lucky.

35:42.481 --> 35:46.206
Well, I mean, we would be very lucky if we had a new Shakespeare or a new Dante.

35:47.167 --> 35:54.196
I think that there is a sense in which one doesn't share the experience.

35:55.558 --> 35:58.562
I don't now share the experience of the 20-year-olds.

36:00.044 --> 36:03.509
I think I knew very well the poets would come before me.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.374
I knew very well the poets of, say, Lowell's generation.

36:07.474 --> 36:09.957
Lowell was, I guess, 17 years older than I.

36:10.932 --> 36:22.843
That Lowell, Berryman, Plath generation, which ranged from people somewhat older than I to people my own age, like Sylvia Plath.

36:22.903 --> 36:24.625
That generation is now dying.

36:25.125 --> 36:37.817
They're a little older than I. Again, the post-World War II people, Ginsburg has died, Merrill has died, and there are others around, Ammons, Ashbery, Merwin, but they are all 17 now, rich.

36:38.540 --> 36:44.868
The generation after that of the 40-year-olds, 47-year-olds, 45-year-olds, I feel I know, too.

36:45.508 --> 36:50.975
But the generation of the 25-year-olds, I think, may be going to be too remote for me in experience.

36:51.015 --> 36:51.456
I don't know.

36:51.496 --> 37:00.667
They've grown up in a different culture, mediated a lot more by television and popular culture, perhaps, that I don't share.

37:00.687 --> 37:07.635
I mean, it's hard to... You say, Compass is pretty much your own lifetime, and then going back, but then, of course, historically,

37:07.987 --> 37:13.773
Now, it's kind of a paradox.

37:14.434 --> 37:19.639
You were hesitant to engage Shakespeare, but you didn't hesitate to engage Keats.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.182
Does that make Keats any less formidable?

37:22.202 --> 37:32.973
No, I hadn't known Keats since I was twelve, and I didn't write my book about it until 1985, so it was about, you know, whatever, I don't know how long that is, about forty years before I wrote on Keats.

37:34.515 --> 37:37.318
I mean, I was twelve in 1945 when the war ended.

37:37.737 --> 37:44.366
I certainly first read Keats when I was twelve, and I wrote, the book I wrote about him, I think it was published maybe eighty-five.

37:44.386 --> 37:45.788
Wonderful book, by the way.

37:45.808 --> 37:46.208
Thank you.

37:46.689 --> 37:59.566
I remember the fact that I was present at the National Book Critics Circle when you received your wonderful line, I think, because you were getting married and your teacher said, well, Helen, I know it's going to be difficult, but at least read a sonnet every day.

37:59.586 --> 38:00.828
That's right.

38:01.048 --> 38:03.051
It was Roseman, too, yes.

38:03.071 --> 38:06.175
I've repeated it to other students.

38:07.538 --> 38:15.166
But there is a kind of lifeline of, I don't mean just language, but shaped into form.

38:15.847 --> 38:29.901
I mean, each poem has a shape of its own, an idiosyncratic shape that impresses itself strongly, as a piece of music does too, as a certain quartet night or a certain leader cycle or something.

38:30.722 --> 38:35.267
And it's an irremovable shape.

38:35.787 --> 38:37.989
You can't forget it.

38:38.009 --> 38:38.950
It's just there.

38:38.970 --> 38:39.671
It's imprinted.

38:40.452 --> 38:57.569
And so it's not just language, because if you like just language, you would be happy with, say, a novel just as much, this wonderful language and novel.

38:58.029 --> 38:58.970
But I like shapes.

38:59.651 --> 39:04.596
Now, who was the teacher that said, read something every day, even if it's just a sonnet?

39:05.690 --> 39:07.813
She was a teacher at Connecticut College.

39:08.073 --> 39:09.475
Did you spell her name?

39:09.495 --> 39:14.342
R-O-S-E-M-O-N-D-T-U-V-E.

39:15.423 --> 39:20.510
She was a visiting professor here one year when I was in graduate school, so I got to know her.

39:21.071 --> 39:26.358
I hate to waste time going over the Vita, but is there something that you could give me at some point before?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.601
I'll be glad.

39:29.923 --> 39:33.047
I asked that question for a purpose, not just to get the teacher's name, but

39:33.314 --> 39:35.018
But did you follow this teacher's advice?

39:35.078 --> 39:36.502
Do you read poetry every day?

39:36.562 --> 39:38.186
No, I don't read poetry every day.

39:38.286 --> 39:46.446
Mostly I'm reading, you know, whatever, the opera omnia of the people that we are hoping to hire or something like that.

39:47.017 --> 39:58.087
As you get older in this profession, more and more of your reading turns out to be professional reading, sometimes for juries, sometimes for prizes, sometimes for searches.

39:58.247 --> 40:03.992
Sometimes you read the works of your students, dissertation students, so that you're reading an awful lot of prose.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.675
I read poetry as much as I can.

40:07.615 --> 40:11.199
Do you read certain poems over and over again?

40:11.519 --> 40:13.060
Oh, yeah.

40:13.080 --> 40:13.721
I never tired.

40:13.741 --> 40:14.982
What would immediately spring to mind?

40:15.350 --> 40:23.398
Well, I mean, I never tire of reading Stevens, who is my favorite poet, and in whom I always find new things.

40:25.380 --> 40:37.713
I mean, I need Stevens to interpret myself to me, and there's always in Stevens really wonderful things that you haven't seen in the last decade.

40:37.733 --> 40:44.580
It's true of every great poet that each decade, poems that you have completely slighted in the preceding decades,

40:45.067 --> 41:13.605
suddenly come up in letters of gold and you thought how could I have missed that before but there's a wonderful poem that I just read of Stevens that I had completely never written about completely ignored called The Green Plant and it's about getting old and it's once upon a time you lived in a red and green forest it is red and green the primary colors red for the sun and green for the vegetation your world is red and green now it is it then went down to being

41:13.872 --> 41:15.314
maroon and olive.

41:15.975 --> 41:20.100
And now you're not even living in the maroon and olive world anymore.

41:20.140 --> 41:25.627
You are living in what he calls the legend of the maroon and olive forest.

41:25.987 --> 41:31.494
So it's so far back, even the maroon and olive forest is so far back that it has now become legendary.

41:31.854 --> 41:32.976
So you're really far gone.

41:33.456 --> 41:38.783
And you really feel that everything is faded down now to almost colorlessness.

41:39.320 --> 41:47.308
Now that you're even so far away from those colors that you thought were so dreary, maroon and olive, by comparison to red and green, but now you have only the dim memory of those.

41:48.129 --> 41:55.016
And suddenly, though, he says, there's a green plant growing outside the window, and it doesn't care anything about you.

41:55.937 --> 42:03.205
And, you know, it's the young growing up as you're going down into your grayness after your maroon and oliveness after your red and greenness.

42:03.225 --> 42:06.588
It's almost like the theme of the 73 sonnet.

42:06.628 --> 42:07.369
Yes, yes.

42:09.053 --> 42:11.936
But it's barbaric, the green plant that's growing up.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.678
And it has nothing to do with it.

42:13.778 --> 42:15.720
It's very, very cool in a way, isn't it?

42:15.740 --> 42:16.000
It is.

42:16.040 --> 42:22.667
It's a wonderful, harsh poem of the eternal recrudescence of the young and their energy.

42:23.348 --> 42:37.542
If you had a chance, that was a dumb question, but I've asked it to some people, but if you could spend an hour with Shakespeare, what questions would you, what questions burn most, I guess to put it in a less

42:37.808 --> 42:45.277
in a silly way, what baffles you most about the person that he could answer directly for you?

42:45.297 --> 42:45.517
Why?

42:45.537 --> 42:46.398
He stopped writing.

42:48.180 --> 42:51.204
He was a compulsive and copious writer.

42:52.886 --> 42:59.234
He was trading out two or three plays a year, except in the years when they closed the theaters for the plagues.

43:00.475 --> 43:06.162
There's a very mysterious ending to Shakespeare's life in which, after having left

43:06.513 --> 43:13.768
the dull backwater that it was and spent all his time in London with Ben Johnson and everybody else.

43:13.788 --> 43:22.024
He knows that he's not doing it right anymore because he says he has prospero saying he'll drown his brooks and break his death.

43:22.375 --> 43:32.106
He knows that something is going to prevent his writing in the future, and that he won't be writing anymore, and that he'd better go home where somehow there'll be people to take care of him.

43:32.907 --> 43:38.974
Now, I don't know why that was, but I don't think he would ever have willingly left London unless there was something very wrong.

43:39.334 --> 43:42.838
And he did live for at least another seven years, wasn't he?

43:43.159 --> 43:44.400
Yes, he did.

43:45.460 --> 43:57.194
was happening in those years, and why a compulsive writer should form False Island, and how he knew he wasn't going to write anymore, and why he went home out of the city where he had spent all his adult life.

43:58.216 --> 43:58.736
I don't know.

43:59.557 --> 44:04.624
I asked that same question to Robert Giroux, the publisher, Elizabeth Bishop.

44:04.664 --> 44:11.332
He said instantly, I'd like to know why, as a publisher, he never dared to publish his place.

44:12.053 --> 44:13.915
Why was it so irrelevant to him?

44:14.283 --> 44:18.414
I know, but he certainly knew he was brilliant.

44:18.534 --> 44:20.660
He must have known he was brilliant.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.705
I mean, Ben Johnson published his works.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.109
It was later, though.

44:24.189 --> 44:25.252
They called them works.

44:25.272 --> 44:26.335
Yes, but that was later.

44:27.428 --> 44:28.730
after Shakespeare died.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.232
I mean, it was not common to do that.

44:32.395 --> 44:46.035
Johnson had a very strong affinity with Latin writers and liked the folios of Virgil and Hallmark and so on that he had seen and thought of himself in the line.

44:46.055 --> 44:48.238
That's why he wrote Sejanus and Catiline.

44:48.843 --> 44:50.865
He thought of himself as a classical author.

44:51.205 --> 44:54.489
Shakespeare never thought of himself as Sejanus or Capiline, really.

44:54.549 --> 44:56.891
He was a country kid, do you think, in his real life?

44:56.911 --> 44:58.032
He was a vernacular.

44:58.072 --> 44:58.733
He's like Dante.

44:58.793 --> 45:00.114
He wanted the vernacular.

45:00.134 --> 45:01.275
He loved the vernacular.

45:02.056 --> 45:16.150
And did not hark back, in a way, to the... He borrowed his stories occasionally from Plutarch, but a lot of his stories were just borrowed from Boccaccio or Giraldo Sinti or something.

45:16.855 --> 45:22.022
He liked the contemporary or the medieval, or he didn't feel obliged to go back to the classical.

45:22.042 --> 45:26.048
Of course, he wasn't formally educated, which they don't.

45:26.068 --> 45:27.350
Neither was Ben Johnson, though.

45:27.370 --> 45:28.472
They held against him.

45:28.612 --> 45:29.333
Yes, of course.

45:29.353 --> 45:34.420
This is probably why they can't accept that Shakespeare is Shakespeare, you know.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.745
Well, often the autodidact, as we all know, is the best educated of all.

45:37.905 --> 45:38.346
It seems.

45:39.267 --> 45:39.888
Yeah.

45:39.908 --> 45:41.310
Like Blake.

45:41.645 --> 45:49.557
I asked Schoenbaum that question, too, and he said he would like to get at the wellsprings of creativity.

45:49.637 --> 45:55.306
He said that's what fascinated him most was, you know, where did this stuff come from?

45:55.386 --> 45:57.950
And of course, that you're never going to hear.

45:57.970 --> 46:08.766
Do you think there are any secrets, not secrets, but any aspects of his experience that are still reachable for us, the things, either factual things, the things about his writing,

46:09.370 --> 46:10.933
Oh, I certainly know.

46:10.973 --> 46:24.841
I think there are always new discoveries to be made about writing, because each age brings new intellectual tools, whether it's bringing Freud and Marx to texts, like Shakespeare, that had not had Freud and Marx, hadn't been looked through through those lenses before.

46:25.502 --> 46:30.332
I don't say that everything discovered through those lenses is true, but there are new lenses with which to look.

46:30.498 --> 46:36.103
And linguistics can't offer us enough that's been done with linguistics and literature at all.

46:36.984 --> 46:46.413
And certainly there are always comparisons that are very fruitful, but the people haven't yet gotten around to making.

46:47.054 --> 47:00.066
I mean, it would be very fruitful to compare, say, Shakespeare and perhaps trying to think who might be the best.

47:00.772 --> 47:05.419
somebody who has the same human power, say, Chekhov, maybe that's been done.

47:06.080 --> 47:11.328
But you can't be a Shakespeare with Chekhov in the early 19th century, because Chekhov isn't there yet.

47:11.728 --> 47:14.472
But once Chekhov comes, he makes you see things.

47:14.533 --> 47:21.944
I think he's the person most like Shakespeare among all the dramatists, because he's the only unjudging one like Shakespeare.

47:22.124 --> 47:25.569
And, uh, I mean, he sympathizes with everybody, sort of.

47:25.789 --> 47:26.290
And, um,

47:27.097 --> 47:33.746
But you could see new things in Shakespeare through the lens of Chekhov that you couldn't have seen in Shakespeare before Chekhov was born.

47:34.547 --> 47:35.087
It's like that.

47:35.107 --> 47:35.969
It always evolves.

47:38.171 --> 47:46.903
Probably you see new things in Mozart through Stravinsky that one couldn't have seen in Mozart until Stravinsky came along and used certain aspects of him.

47:46.923 --> 47:48.345
I like that.

47:49.266 --> 47:56.175
Briefly, I am interested in this whole canon debate, and I was...

47:56.881 --> 48:01.929
I'm surprised, not surprised, but I read with great interest your review of Denby's book.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.995
What was it about that book that so disturbed you?

48:07.057 --> 48:11.283
Partly that you hadn't learned anything the second time around, and you hadn't learned anything the first time around either.

48:11.303 --> 48:13.026
I mean, that seemed so depressing.

48:13.867 --> 48:15.109
It was very depressing.

48:15.882 --> 48:18.124
that he hadn't learned anything that he thought he had.

48:18.164 --> 48:26.953
I guess it's depressing for a teacher to see how obtuse people can be, even though they're grown up, you know?

48:27.714 --> 48:34.441
And they think for yourself congratulatory about how much they're learning, but you can see reading him that he really hadn't learned anything.

48:34.461 --> 48:35.742
What was he missing in your view?

48:37.404 --> 48:45.012
He was missing the capacity to lose himself in the work of art, so that if he reads King Lear he has to talk about him and his mother.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.070
not what King Lear is there for.

48:47.110 --> 49:02.852
King Lear is there for you to live with King Lear and Garnel and Regan and Gloucester and Edmund and Edmund and Kent and the Fool for a while, and to see what is, what was in it for Shakespeare to write that play.

49:03.593 --> 49:10.764
If all you could do with King Lear is saying, I wasn't that bad to my mother, you haven't lived within the play sufficiently.

49:12.025 --> 49:13.227
It's not a laugh, it is not.

49:13.628 --> 49:22.260
Do you find this whole debate about the relevance of the canon, the Western canon in decline, a really uninteresting subject?

49:22.280 --> 49:31.011
Do you think it's a little overplayed, or is there a legitimate concern, that political... Well, things go in and out of the canon.

49:31.692 --> 49:34.776
I mean... That's a word that hardly was ever used in my day.

49:34.836 --> 49:35.978
Of course not.

49:36.278 --> 49:43.568
It's misleading, because as everyone has pointed out, it comes to the Biblical canon, which was closed by ecclesiastical fiat.

49:44.257 --> 49:51.765
Whereas the literary canon, in the first place, nobody has the authority to close it, and secondly, it's always evolving and changing.

49:54.148 --> 50:02.277
Somebody can do a lot for an author by paying a lot of attention to him, as when, for instance, Eliot paid all that attention to Dante.

50:02.778 --> 50:12.829
Dante had not been a very congenial subject to the English literary tradition because he was a Roman Catholic, and Protestantism kind of tended to junk Roman Catholic literature.

50:13.518 --> 50:18.927
I mean, there are ways that things go in and out of the canon or the political like that or, you know, whatever.

50:19.327 --> 50:22.492
And then Eliot decides to pay all his attention to Dante.

50:23.774 --> 50:30.204
That's another very good historical instance of a great work being more or less shelved in England.

50:30.224 --> 50:38.738
It was never shelved in Italy, of course, but it was more or less shelved in England, although Chaucer loved Dante, of course, but Chaucer was before the Reformation.

50:39.279 --> 50:41.382
Yes, and then after the Reformation,

50:42.087 --> 51:11.925
There is a prejudice against reading works of Catholicism of Catholic authors, and just as you might say, there was an attempt by the Roman Catholic Church through the Index of Forbidden Books to proscribe the reading of Voltaire, Diogo Pascal, so everybody was on the index because they were Enlightenment rationalists, or else they were Protestant chancenists or whatever, but

51:12.327 --> 51:21.198
There are always these extra-literary reasons that people are dropped from school curricula, are included in school curricula.

51:22.179 --> 51:28.586
Fox's Book of Martyrs was practically required reading for everybody in 16th century England, and who reads it now?

51:28.646 --> 51:31.149
It's not in canon, though it's a worthy book.

51:32.411 --> 51:41.001
Paul LeClaire, when he was a student at Holy Cross, he's the president of the New York Public Library and a scholar, and he said he had to

51:41.757 --> 51:47.005
They formally request permission from the Bishop of Worcester to read Voltaire.

51:47.045 --> 51:47.546
Exactly.

51:48.247 --> 51:49.449
And they gave him permission.

51:49.509 --> 51:53.836
And the teacher, the Jesuit priest, had to get permission to teach it to him.

51:54.416 --> 51:55.238
I mean, think about that.

51:55.498 --> 52:03.150
Well, I was in Catholic schools myself, so it's one of the reasons why I have no talk with any ideology.

52:04.051 --> 52:09.019
And that's why I didn't major in English in college, I majored in chemistry.

52:09.039 --> 52:09.840
You're kidding.

52:10.394 --> 52:19.102
I didn't like the way they taught literature for those reasons, so I simply moved over tonight.

52:19.122 --> 52:25.307
My parents wouldn't let me go to anybody's house, so I simply did chemistry, and I had a Fulbright in math, and then I did my Ph.D.

52:25.327 --> 52:26.488
in English.

52:26.508 --> 52:30.712
When I was free to do as I pleased, I came here and did my Ph.D.

52:30.732 --> 52:32.093
That paycheck in a way.

52:32.113 --> 52:40.300
He went to law school because his father demanded it, and then finally when his father died, and now he said, I can do what I want to do.

52:41.714 --> 52:45.879
Well, that's the way one becomes oneself, of course.

52:45.899 --> 52:54.328
I think we've got about five minutes, and I love the idea that there are all these cryptographic elements tucked into the sonnets.

52:54.688 --> 52:55.609
There aren't that many.

52:56.711 --> 53:09.645
I mean, it's true that the Renaissance liked games, and there are many Renaissance poems that play various

53:10.351 --> 53:12.433
Sometimes they do acrostics.

53:12.453 --> 53:15.336
Sometimes, as in George Herbert, they do anagrams.

53:16.377 --> 53:19.880
He does an anagram, George Herbert does, on Mary and army.

53:19.920 --> 53:31.192
He turns the letters over the word Mary, the name Mary, into the word army, and says, How well her name and army doth present, in whom the Lord of hosts doth pitch his tent.

53:31.712 --> 53:33.534
And he makes up something clever like that.

53:34.114 --> 53:39.700
Herbert also wrote a little poem that has an axiom going down diagonally.

53:40.051 --> 53:43.755
Our life is hid with Christ in God.

53:43.775 --> 53:45.797
One word in each line, slanting down.

53:46.438 --> 53:49.842
And so you read it downwards like that and say, I like it in Christ with God.

53:50.242 --> 53:52.144
And he doesn't, he's not trying to fool you or anything.

53:52.164 --> 54:00.593
He puts the quote from, he puts the reference to Colossians at the head of the poem and shows you, and italicizes the words.

54:01.274 --> 54:03.717
But it's, yes, I mean, they like these games.

54:03.817 --> 54:08.362
It's a form of game playing, but no poem is made good by game playing.

54:08.542 --> 54:09.703
I mean, it's only something

54:10.156 --> 54:19.586
But someone like Shakespeare, who already is an accomplished writer, puts an obstacle in his own path to make it more fun.

54:21.067 --> 54:23.710
You know, it's hurdles in racing.

54:24.811 --> 54:31.678
You point out he's fanciful, but not frivolous, and I think that's a very, very important thing.

54:31.778 --> 54:38.745
And then a final question, you know, one of the reasons you hear often for not teaching something in a

54:39.012 --> 54:45.499
Is relevance important to you?

54:45.539 --> 54:46.219
Not to art.

54:47.781 --> 54:48.482
I mean, art.

54:49.743 --> 54:56.690
In the first place, art creates its own relevance, in the sense that it may not seem relevant to people.

54:57.071 --> 55:02.756
People were very shocked when Gauguin went off and started painting in those flat, muddy colors.

55:03.497 --> 55:08.142
Right in the middle of Impressionism, when everyone was painting pink and blue,

55:08.324 --> 55:23.701
and then he goes and does these flat, muddy paintings of what they think of as ugly women, and people don't understand why he's left Paris and why he's doing his painting and has gone primitive and whatever, and then he creates his own relevance.

55:23.721 --> 55:26.484
And now, you know, everybody flocks to see the... Great.

55:26.504 --> 55:28.967
Terrific quote, by the way, to wrap up on it.

55:28.987 --> 55:30.468
Would you inscribe my copy?

55:30.488 --> 55:31.309
I'd love to.

55:31.329 --> 55:32.090
I know you have a speech.

55:32.110 --> 55:33.512
I'd like it.

55:33.552 --> 55:35.614
Industrial picture, you know?

55:35.674 --> 55:38.297
So why did you like it so much?

55:38.497 --> 56:08.352
or I came across it in the getty and I just froze because there's two signs of Shakespeare's about how desire will outstrip even the fastest horse and there it is then should I spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall I know then can no horse with my desire keep pace and so he gives his horse leave to go and he runs up at the speed of desire so this is Petrarch that says bus desire leads me on so it just

56:08.585 --> 56:12.090
I just was rooted to the spot when I saw it in the guinea.

56:12.651 --> 56:15.595
It never occurred to me even slightly that it was inappropriate.

56:16.557 --> 56:18.259
No marketing department.

56:18.279 --> 56:21.124
Even the Belknap Press, though, which is supposed to be here.

56:21.144 --> 56:24.188
And then they had to apologize to me because they tipped the title page in wrong.

56:24.208 --> 56:26.071
It's not supposed to be glued to the end paper.

56:26.491 --> 56:28.835
It's supposed to be glued to the next signature.

56:29.356 --> 56:31.699
But in fact, it is glued to the end paper.

56:31.719 --> 56:34.163
The title page precedes the half title, that is.

56:34.323 --> 56:35.284
Yes, it's all wrong.

56:35.885 --> 56:37.748
So they said the next printing, I'll do it right.

56:38.048 --> 56:43.014
Yeah, it makes a pretty nice, uh, getting my card.

56:43.095 --> 56:46.499
I'll leave you my card by the way.

56:46.519 --> 56:47.200
Do you need an email at all?

56:47.340 --> 56:49.683
No, I, it's an invention of the devil.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.667
I want it, I'm done.

56:52.687 --> 56:54.970
Drabble said she has it, but she's afraid of it.

56:56.652 --> 56:57.373
I'm sorry.
