05:31.136 --> 05:31.757
They're going nuts.

05:32.698 --> 05:34.640
I don't know why they should get nuts.

05:36.843 --> 05:41.108
Have you ever seen my book?

05:41.148 --> 05:41.348
Huh?

05:42.690 --> 05:46.214
Have you ever seen my book?

05:46.234 --> 05:46.354
No.

05:46.374 --> 05:49.117
My book, I've seen it.

05:49.137 --> 05:50.138
It's a copy of my book.

05:50.258 --> 05:51.740
It's a copy of my book.

05:51.760 --> 05:52.962
It's a copy of my book.

05:55.885 --> 05:56.666
It's a copy of my book.

05:56.686 --> 05:57.927
It's a copy of my book.

05:57.947 --> 05:58.788
It's a copy of my book.

05:58.808 --> 05:59.269
It's a copy of my book.

06:00.127 --> 06:00.808
Very good.

06:01.048 --> 06:01.889
So who designed the couple?

06:02.790 --> 06:07.356
I picked the art, but this woman here, Raquel Camarillo.

06:07.376 --> 06:07.656
You know what?

06:08.858 --> 06:13.163
No, no, it's just being a publisher, that's all of that.

06:13.183 --> 06:13.864
What's your picture?

06:14.705 --> 06:15.626
That's her picture.

06:15.646 --> 06:16.868
Oh, it's her picture.

06:16.888 --> 06:17.509
Well, that's your picture.

06:17.629 --> 06:19.111
Okay, I thought it was someone else's picture.

06:19.131 --> 06:19.772
You heard your name.

06:20.112 --> 06:20.813
That's a mess.

06:23.636 --> 06:24.177
I'll figure out my picture.

06:24.578 --> 06:35.388
People who are mad about this.

06:35.408 --> 06:36.129
Oh, it's a story.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.732
Yeah, I agree.

06:38.752 --> 06:45.418
It took me eight years to write this, sucker.

06:45.438 --> 06:52.725
The good news is, see, the good news is... $35?

06:52.845 --> 06:53.826
$49?

06:54.835 --> 07:09.651
The first two numbers have been taken out, which means the first two are sold out.

07:10.852 --> 07:14.937
More and more.

07:15.858 --> 07:24.167
The second printing was 11,000, and now the third is 18,000.

07:24.434 --> 07:27.037
It's just a $35,000.

07:27.137 --> 07:28.479
Nice, huh?

07:28.999 --> 07:32.523
I got picked up by the Book of the Month Club.

07:32.543 --> 07:37.569
The Book of the Month Club is not like to be a lot of things, right?

07:37.589 --> 07:39.031
Yeah, but they got a million members.

07:40.512 --> 07:42.234
My book will be in a million catalogs.

07:43.155 --> 07:43.956
You can order it.

07:43.976 --> 07:47.540
When you move that off-graft, it's like roadie meat.

07:47.881 --> 07:51.505
You have to sell a lot of books to make money, you know?

07:52.058 --> 08:06.179
It's called an advance, and that's an advance on earnings.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.688
So what an advance means is to basically advance you X amount of dollars, which you agree upon.

08:13.429 --> 08:19.618
In my case, it was done in a couple of days, because I really had a very small advance.

08:20.695 --> 08:22.938
So I made the nut back.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.184
No, I don't even get paid to April.

08:27.204 --> 08:31.089
They pay you once every nine months.

08:31.149 --> 08:32.831
Semi-annually, my first, I don't get it.

08:32.851 --> 08:34.714
I won't see a nickel until April of 96.

08:36.957 --> 08:38.539
It sucks.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.180
But that's life.

08:42.785 --> 08:47.371
Well, yeah, but... They use the money.

08:47.411 --> 08:49.774
Now they want to sell me, they want me to, huh?

08:50.294 --> 08:59.225
Now they want me to write another book.

08:59.366 --> 09:04.612
The idea is to get an advance this year.

09:04.873 --> 09:16.167
That may be so, but you tend to make more money in the second book.

09:34.203 --> 09:46.913
Thank you.

11:32.935 --> 11:58.977
Oh, my God.

12:20.455 --> 12:39.403
and a system movement from Somata by Tom Cesar Abel, who is more known by the network for the government of Elson and Elson.

12:39.423 --> 12:42.447
Laura has believed that it just came out this year to be the first solo album on a TV in which she has switched the programming between Abel and Elson.

12:42.427 --> 12:54.847
This is the house of glory and the essential salvation of each other in the world.

12:54.867 --> 12:55.208
What other words?

12:55.228 --> 12:55.308
Yes.

12:55.328 --> 12:55.408
Yes.

12:55.428 --> 12:55.509
Yes.

12:55.529 --> 12:55.609
Yes.

12:56.855 --> 13:21.052
It gives you a feeling that, you know, when you're looking to a large scale of people, and some others, you also know, a single movement.

13:21.072 --> 13:24.036
So, you know, there's a lot of work, and you can see an afternoon, a lot of work, and I can see, on the latest one, the whole flexion of the blades.

13:24.056 --> 13:24.617
You can just tremble people.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.258
And, you know, it gives me that

13:26.926 --> 13:42.876
And that's really, on that, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future, I mean, there's a lot of people who don't say over the future,

13:42.856 --> 14:07.480
And you've had a record very long time yet when this case was supposed to take a sonata by the mass people from the movement from the people.

14:33.970 --> 14:57.733
THE END

15:05.932 --> 15:24.936
Thank you.

15:32.307 --> 15:36.057
Thank you.

15:59.307 --> 16:27.120
Oh, my God.

We'll announce prize winners like subscriptions to Indian Hill Symphony's concert series, Dinners at Paparazzi, and more.

57:19.088 --> 57:20.590
I want to talk to Tennyson.

57:20.610 --> 57:27.157
When a young girl is taken from her mother's London loan, investigators try to narrow down the suspects.

57:27.177 --> 57:29.440
Forensics are a nice man.

57:29.480 --> 57:32.283
Fingerprints have fibers galore.

57:32.303 --> 57:37.209
So we have to proceed on the assumption that Vicky Warren was abducted for nurture or abuse.

No, no, I do not know that.

58:02.085 --> 58:05.232

58:16.709 --> 58:17.230
Oh, hi, Kevin.

58:17.250 --> 58:20.494
I heard an ad on the radio about footstock, and my feet are killing me.

58:20.514 --> 58:22.997
I guess all those years in the NFL have taken a toll on your feet.

58:23.017 --> 58:27.343
Yeah, they sure have, and I've been so frustrated trying to find shoes that fit my feet and my lifestyle.

58:27.543 --> 58:31.488
I know what you mean, but since my family and I discovered footstock, we've had total comfort.

58:31.708 --> 58:36.354
I have heard that the people at footstock are really knowledgeable and will work with me until they get the right fit.

58:36.374 --> 58:38.978
Yeah, they still measure my feet every time I come in.

58:39.118 --> 58:40.159
They really do care.

58:40.139 --> 58:42.884
Do you have any insights as to what brand I should try?

58:42.924 --> 58:45.549
Well, all of their shoes are the finest Europe has to offer.

58:45.569 --> 58:50.719
They carry Mephisto, Zita, Teresia, Birkenstock, Arsch, Echo, and more.

58:51.220 --> 58:54.246
Ah, so that's why they say a little bit of Europe in my own backyard.

58:54.767 --> 58:55.969
Thanks a lot for the insight, Kevin.

58:55.989 --> 58:57.452
Is there anything I can do for you?

58:57.773 --> 59:00.338
How about, uh, Super Bowl tickets?

59:00.358 --> 59:00.578
What?

59:00.558 --> 59:03.823
Well, Footstock in Wellesley Center and Concord Center.

59:03.843 --> 59:09.552
Bring your slightly used shoes or sneakers to Footstock and they'll donate them to Friends and Boston Homeless Center for you.

59:09.612 --> 59:12.116
Footstock, a little bit of Europe in your own backyard.

59:14.119 --> 59:22.532
When you lease a new GM car or truck with Smart Lease by GMAC, you can get monthly payments that are typically 30% lower than if you buy it with a bank auto loan.

59:22.900 --> 59:26.885
To demonstrate the difference 30% can make, we'll make my voice 30% lower.

59:26.965 --> 59:29.588
Now it's 30% higher.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.751
Quite a difference, huh?

59:31.771 --> 59:37.839
For details about Smart Lease, call 1-800-32-SMART based on a bank rate monitor survey comparing contracts with similar length.

59:38.379 --> 59:40.041
Okay, I'd like to hear your voice back.

59:40.562 --> 59:40.862
Hello?

59:43.245 --> 59:44.287
Help me!

59:44.307 --> 59:46.309
Once again, the lunchroom here at WCRB.

59:46.525 --> 59:53.294
It's 59 degrees, and here's Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture from 102.5 WCRB.

59:53.314 --> 01:00:00.685
This was his first orchestral masterpiece, 1869, and if the opening sounds a little on the reverend side, well, it should be.

01:00:00.705 --> 01:00:02.968
It's sort of a picture of Friar Lawrence.

01:00:03.489 --> 01:00:11.740
Here's the Royal Philharmonic in Vladimir Ashkenazi at 102.5 WCRB.

01:00:30.721 --> 01:00:51.379
Jesus Christ, you asshole.
