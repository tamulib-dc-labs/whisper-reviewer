WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:31.641
Well, out of the Lincoln and out of other ones, Washington, the book I did on Washington, the book I did on Jefferson, because I was constantly getting the question, why don't we have great leaders like that anymore?

00:32.903 --> 00:40.852
People remember the great leaders out of context, that they were great leaders in a society that was much worse than ours in all ways.

00:42.094 --> 00:44.977
The politics was far dirtier.

00:45.858 --> 00:53.086
There was nothing like the kind of vilification that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson underwent.

00:53.507 --> 00:54.808
Do you think it's tame today?

00:54.868 --> 00:55.389
Absolutely.

00:55.409 --> 00:56.030
Oh, terribly.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.152
Very tame.

01:00.022 --> 01:03.006
Yeah, look at Chuck.

01:03.046 --> 01:12.717
He was not only accused of adultery, but of adultery with a black slave who was more in his power than any office seeker or a governor.

01:13.598 --> 01:29.337
And at a time when miscegenation and race mingling were considered horrors and abominations to much of the nation, he was called an atheist when that was an extremely damaging charge.

01:30.312 --> 01:33.916
It was said that he had collaborated with the French terror.

01:36.198 --> 01:39.702
John Quincy Adams was accused of being a pimp.

01:39.802 --> 01:50.254
When he ran for president, circumstantial stories were published saying that he had procured women for Tsar Alexander when he was the ambassador to St.

01:50.294 --> 01:50.854
Petersburg.

01:52.456 --> 01:59.003
Washington was accused of plotting to return a kingship ruled by king to the government.

01:59.540 --> 02:04.826
Which could be, you know, what charge could be worse to a man who ran the revolution that he's betraying his own revolution.

02:04.846 --> 02:10.152
So Bill should lighten up a bit.

02:10.212 --> 02:10.732
Sure.

02:10.752 --> 02:23.767
But my point is that we don't recognize leadership in our midst because leaders are always criticized and they're bound to be because the follower does not simply defer to the leader as a superior being.

02:24.267 --> 02:26.610
The followers are always engaged in a struggle with the leader.

02:27.603 --> 02:30.266
People resist leadership, after all.

02:30.326 --> 02:32.748
It's somebody else telling you what to do, and you don't want that.

02:33.809 --> 02:42.358
And even if they are on the side of the leader in some respects, they often think the leader has been betraying them.

02:42.498 --> 02:52.108
For instance, if you elect a leader for a certain cause, reduce the deficit, let's say.

02:53.506 --> 02:58.250
Even if he gets a majority of people, you know, maybe 51% saying they want to reduce the deficit.

02:59.131 --> 03:00.612
Some want to do it by shrinking government.

03:00.693 --> 03:02.854
Some want to do it by raising taxes.

03:03.115 --> 03:05.537
Some want to do it by changing entitlements.

03:06.198 --> 03:16.267
And if you do it by this means, the people who voted for you, hoping you would do it by another means, feel betrayed and especially angry.

03:16.287 --> 03:21.611
They can get more angry than the people who are your putative opponents.

03:22.072 --> 03:23.293
For instance, look at Nixon.

03:23.797 --> 03:30.045
It was the right wing, some of it, that was angrier at him than anybody on the left.

03:30.926 --> 03:50.412
When everybody else was being kind of nice to Nixon, they called up people like Bill Rusher and Buchanan and others, who figured that wage and price controls and de-tom of Russia and opening to China and salt talks were tremendous betrayals at the very core of the conservative position.

03:51.151 --> 03:56.279
So, leaders are always going to have criticism at the time.

03:56.339 --> 04:00.847
It's only in retrospect that we look back and we say, oh, we had great leaders then.

04:01.668 --> 04:03.291
You know, look at Dr. King.

04:03.331 --> 04:17.614
I've heard a thousand times, I think, that in the interval between his death and now, when black leaders arrived, Jesse Jackson, we heard this constantly when Jesse Jackson was running for president.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.867
Oh, for the good old days when we had a nice, respectable leader like Dr. King.

04:22.887 --> 04:28.456
Well, when Dr. King was alive, of course, he was subject to vitriol and venom.

04:28.696 --> 04:28.916
Yeah.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.679
But people forget that.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.505
And so now they just want to remember the good side of it.

04:34.525 --> 04:42.657
And so with Lincoln, for instance, the man was called an ape and ignoramus and a betrayer also.

04:43.779 --> 04:46.403
The abolitionists considered him a betrayer.

04:46.670 --> 04:49.314
Nathaniel Parker had very bitter things to say about him.

04:49.674 --> 04:58.728
That opening, pardon me, but that opening quote, which I guess you pulled out of the Library of America, where Lincoln is absolutely bailing out on the slave issue.

04:58.748 --> 05:16.153
Yeah, in order to get elected, he had to repeat again and again that he was not for black voting, not for black social equality, not for marriage, not for any of those things, because he would never be elected unless he had made those pledges.

05:16.538 --> 05:21.245
A leader always has to find what can actually get a following.

05:21.405 --> 05:27.434
Hypocrisy is essential, isn't it?

05:27.454 --> 05:28.716
Well, it's a hypocrisy.

05:28.736 --> 05:32.421
It's certainly economizing on the truth.

05:33.022 --> 05:42.035
Although, you know, I think he was sincere in saying he was not for those things because he knew they were not workable.

05:42.055 --> 05:45.600
It's like saying, I'm not for a four-sided triangle.

05:46.087 --> 05:53.255
He knew that it would be hard enough simply to check the spread of slavery in the 1850s.

05:53.776 --> 05:57.600
And if he could do that, he was doing the maximum that was feasible.

05:58.822 --> 06:00.864
So he said he's not for any of those things.

06:02.926 --> 06:05.549
It's like saying, I'm not for going to the moon at that time.

06:05.589 --> 06:08.112
You know, that was not going to arise.

06:08.693 --> 06:15.621
Your decision to take this quality, which you have studied principally in political figures,

06:15.989 --> 06:20.334
and to expand it into sports figures, entertainment figures, business figures.

06:20.814 --> 06:25.619
Tell me a little bit about that, and to find the anti-types.

06:26.400 --> 06:34.789
Well, I've always argued that moral leaders are the ones who are most important.

06:34.830 --> 06:42.638
I wrote about that in my book, Confessions of a Conservative, Bearer Requires Under God, that Dr. King

06:43.428 --> 06:55.005
Jane Addams, Anthony Benazep, the Quaker in Philadelphia, are the leaders who have changed our lives most, and that it's wrong to look simply to politics for leadership.

06:55.506 --> 07:08.726
In fact, most resisted change in America, unions, abolition, civil rights, women's suffrage, didn't start in the electoral arena at all because no politician could touch it and survive.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.692
It started with principled minorities led by

07:12.925 --> 07:33.524
people who are not aspiring to office and will never reach it, but who change the society by their advocacy, by their protests, by their assertion of a right, even when it's not a right that can be immediately tinkered into law.

07:35.125 --> 07:40.030
So I've always thought that and written a good deal about it.

07:41.343 --> 07:53.337
And I've always thought that it was wrong to be looking simply to, well, for instance, I've written about Ralph Nader in the past, and I know friends of his or friends of mine who for years and years tried to get him to run for office.

07:53.377 --> 08:00.325
I thought that was a terrible thing, because if he ran for office, he would have a constituency all of whose concerns would have to be addressed.

08:01.927 --> 08:10.877
Things that he's not interested in, not particularly good at, he'd have to worry about servicing constituents' needs in areas

08:11.262 --> 08:24.961
ranging all over the lot, whereas by focusing his activities on the causes that mattered to him, consumer causes mainly, in organizing his groups, he was able to be much more effective.

08:24.981 --> 08:27.044
You don't have to hold office to be effective.

08:27.645 --> 08:28.886
Dr. King held no office.

08:28.906 --> 08:30.108
Jane Addams held no office.

08:30.529 --> 08:32.772
Most of the early feminists held no office.

08:33.293 --> 08:33.753
They couldn't.

08:34.434 --> 08:36.237
They couldn't even vote.

08:36.257 --> 08:40.122
Jeffrey Jackson is probably an example of one who probably shouldn't have run for office.

08:40.709 --> 08:49.157
I think he did run for office thinking he would win.

08:49.297 --> 08:52.841
You know, that was really wild.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.005
Yeah, I think so.

08:57.225 --> 09:02.491
I was following him pretty closely then.

09:04.773 --> 09:05.433
That was wild.

09:05.934 --> 09:10.058
I think running for office in order to get attention to your cause, the way

09:11.000 --> 09:14.745
I'm trying to think now.

09:15.026 --> 09:18.551
Well, William Buckley did in the Libertarian Party.

09:18.711 --> 09:20.874
Chris Gorby's Al was kind of hard to figure out.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.655
Yeah.

09:21.675 --> 09:24.099
But you knowâ€” But you find it, don't you?

09:24.119 --> 09:24.219
Yeah.

09:24.239 --> 09:25.821
You find it with this full Howard Stern.

09:25.922 --> 09:27.123
I mean, what the hell is he trying to do?

09:27.143 --> 09:27.244
Yeah.

09:27.264 --> 09:28.005
Very commoner.

09:28.666 --> 09:37.358
That kind of one that's not really meant to win, but to give you another forum for voicing your opinion.

09:39.601 --> 09:40.703
Is there something innate?

09:41.392 --> 09:46.258
about the natural leader, or is it something that's really old?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.401
Let me just interrupt.

09:48.481 --> 09:55.270
When I was a naval officer many years ago, we used to say we had a number of captains on the ship.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.733
They had this quality command presence.

09:58.814 --> 10:03.680
I mean, the skipper would walk in a room, and everybody knew, without having to say a word.

10:04.281 --> 10:08.526
It's just this kind of aura that kind of comes in with them, and they project it.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.087
It's palpable.

10:10.231 --> 10:11.673
I don't know what that means to comment.

10:11.693 --> 10:17.419
On the other hand, I know people with that kind of radiant personality who have never put it to any use as a leader.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.083
And I know people who don't have that, who nonetheless become leaders.

10:21.103 --> 10:22.465
Nixon's a good example.

10:22.485 --> 10:25.568
Nixon had none of the natural gifts you would expect of a leader.

10:25.588 --> 10:31.695
He's not a good speaker, not good at meeting people, not good at most things that you think... Social greatness.

10:31.795 --> 10:33.036
Right.

10:33.377 --> 10:38.162
And yet he obviously had certain qualities that clicked with the...

10:38.581 --> 10:40.763
potential followership of the time.

10:41.284 --> 10:44.126
Put it in a different time, it wouldn't have worked, I don't think.

10:44.647 --> 11:01.283
One of the things that made it feasible for him to rise was the tremendous sour mood of aggrieved resistance in the sixties when, you know, there was a, people wanted somebody who would be repressive.

11:01.303 --> 11:04.506
The assassination of Robert Kennedy didn't hurt his, his.

11:04.526 --> 11:06.428
Oh yeah, he was lucky too.

11:06.712 --> 11:09.956
And in 72, the attempted assassination of Wallace.

11:09.976 --> 11:17.145
You know, people say, why did he go to all this trouble to sabotage McGovern when McGovern was self-destructing?

11:17.606 --> 11:22.893
Well, he didn't know until May of that year that Wallace was not going to be in the field.

11:23.253 --> 11:24.995
And that was a tremendous threat to him.

11:25.015 --> 11:30.322
Wallace had taken away 13.5% of the vote in 68, and that was from his people.

11:30.883 --> 11:31.704
That was from the right.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.187
And if he had run...

11:34.572 --> 11:37.877
Well, that's arguable.

11:37.917 --> 11:43.806
I mean, McGovern was never his opponent, I don't think.

11:43.906 --> 12:03.094
I voted for him, as many of us in Massachusetts did.

12:03.547 --> 12:08.112
But there was just an overkill on Nixon's part.

12:08.472 --> 12:13.638
Tony Lucas and others think that the break-in was mainly to get stuff on Larry O'Brien.

12:13.658 --> 12:16.220
I think that's another good case of that.

12:16.241 --> 12:20.745
But it was an under-motivated, over-bungled operation, obviously.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.528
It's amazing to see Gordon Liddy at the funeral.

12:23.989 --> 12:29.875
How did he get a ticket, I wonder, of just throwing this out to see?

12:30.192 --> 12:33.056
Yeah, well, Agnew's hard to turn down, after all.

12:33.217 --> 12:34.038
Well, Agnew, he has.

12:34.058 --> 12:34.659
He held the office.

12:34.679 --> 12:38.965
There was a piece in the Times where he asked the family if he would be welcome or unwelcome, and they said he would be.

12:38.985 --> 12:45.835
But it's hard to turn down a man who served in your administration in second place, and, uh, Lee.

12:45.855 --> 12:46.496
I don't know why.

12:46.877 --> 12:49.341
But there he was, up here in the gallery.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.766
I'm trying to jump around like this.

12:52.786 --> 12:55.710
The book does, of course, speak for itself, though.

12:56.045 --> 13:08.058
I love these various categories, you know, charisma and bureaucracy there, these conflictingâ€”again, let's talk about the development of this thesis here, this content.

13:08.539 --> 13:14.606
Yeah, well, when I startedâ€” It is a culmination, apparently, pardon me, of other things that you've worked on.

13:14.746 --> 13:21.073
Yeah, when Iâ€”I had talked about theâ€”

13:22.302 --> 13:26.068
Mark's favorite concept of charisma in my book on Kennedy and my book on Washington.

13:27.150 --> 13:37.385
And I felt that there was more to be said about that, because I didn't go into the other things that he talks about, legitimate authority and bureaucratic authority.

13:39.028 --> 13:46.479
But when I started choosing these people, I deliberately chose them, ones who would go with a theorist.

13:48.062 --> 13:50.065
For instance, I think Machiavelli has

13:51.007 --> 13:53.789
some of the most important things to be said about leadership.

13:53.809 --> 13:59.374
And since he directs all his own comments, most of them at Cesare Borgia, I chose Borgia.

14:00.896 --> 14:06.020
Since Weber chose King David as the type of charismatic leader, I chose him.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.801
I love that, yeah.

14:07.821 --> 14:20.052
Since Clausewitz chose Napoleon as his type of military leader, I did too, because that allows me to use Clausewitz very well.

14:21.112 --> 14:32.671
Since Thorstein Vedlin used the sales as the type of the ultimate business leader, I used that.

14:33.372 --> 14:41.927
I chose Perot because he's the inheritor of Patterson at National Cash Register and of Watson at IBM.

14:41.947 --> 14:47.676
So in effect you get a kind of glimpse of this whole

14:48.297 --> 14:53.985
history from the beginning of the century down to now of the development of this type.

14:54.406 --> 15:05.422
You know, I could have chose Watson, Thomas Watson, but then that would have been only one step away from Patterson, whereas with Perot you see a guy who inherits this whole train of business.

15:05.442 --> 15:06.483
It's very current, too.

15:06.503 --> 15:06.804
Yes.

15:06.924 --> 15:18.000
It does give you aâ€”I mean, it does allow you to write for a general audience, I think, and I guess this is a question as well.

15:18.723 --> 15:27.756
How do you avoid, and I believe you do it, how do you avoid a book like this from making it a pedantic kind of a book and to embrace them?

15:28.277 --> 15:29.179
Well, that's the thing.

15:29.259 --> 15:39.875
In most of my books, I try to begin with something concrete, you know, Nixon, and Nixon agonisties, and then go on to talk about the political system.

15:40.095 --> 15:45.523
And so instead of writing a political science textbook, it helps to personalize it, I think.

15:46.060 --> 15:51.167
My book, The Kennedy Imprisonment, was subtitled Meditation on Power, and it really was that.

15:51.688 --> 16:06.029
But instead of writing an essay on power, I took the Kennedys, especially the old man, as a type of how power corrupts and tends to cripple itself by overreaching.

16:06.089 --> 16:12.979
So the idea of taking these individuals and trying to pin it to them

16:13.482 --> 16:18.627
It's interesting, a lot of the reviews have not even gone on to the theorists.

16:18.647 --> 16:20.870
They've just talked about the individuals.

16:23.452 --> 16:26.115
You know, maybe that's fair on my part, but I tried to use them.

16:26.355 --> 16:30.780
Maybe it's also the fact that you only have 600-word slots in your review or whatever.

16:30.800 --> 16:30.940
Yeah.

16:31.621 --> 16:40.890
So, but it's true, it seems to me, that it's harder just to come to people and start talking about Machiavelli's theories of leadership.

16:41.377 --> 16:53.572
than to tell a little story about Cesare Borgia and how Machiavelli observed him and formulated his own views by watching an actual man in operation.

16:56.416 --> 17:00.121
Tell me a little bit about the selection of Madonna andâ€” Yeah.

17:00.802 --> 17:04.126
Actually, that came about partly by accident.

17:04.186 --> 17:09.072
I asked my studentsâ€”I took a survey of my students when I was teaching a course on leadershipâ€”

17:09.676 --> 17:12.559
and who they considered leaders.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.382
And four or five of them said, Madonna.

17:16.062 --> 17:16.783
Shocking, isn't it?

17:17.183 --> 17:20.206
And I said, well, what goal was she leading you to?

17:20.286 --> 17:23.750
And they said, well, to lead a free and uninhibited life.

17:23.830 --> 17:26.052
I said, was that really her aim?

17:26.072 --> 17:27.273
It was essential then, by the way.

17:27.393 --> 17:27.793
Oh, sure.

17:27.854 --> 17:28.414
Absolutely.

17:28.434 --> 17:29.855
Unless you're moving people toward a goal.

17:30.436 --> 17:33.199
You're just having an influence.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.522
You know, if I hear music, it has an influence on me.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.704
Or if the weather's bad, it has an influence on me.

17:39.207 --> 17:45.896
I look at somebody, and I'm disgusted, and turn it off for TV.

17:45.916 --> 17:46.717
That's an influence.

17:46.797 --> 17:47.839
It's moving to action.

17:48.239 --> 17:52.465
Jim Jones is a leader, then, in Jonestown.

17:52.625 --> 17:52.846
Sure.

17:52.886 --> 17:55.389
Well, yeah, he is a leader.

17:55.449 --> 17:55.730
Sure.

17:57.132 --> 18:00.697
There you get intoâ€” I'm sorry, we'll get back to Madonna in a bit.

18:00.717 --> 18:00.917
Oh, yeah.

18:00.957 --> 18:02.239
Why don't you follow up on that?

18:02.419 --> 18:02.759
Yeah.

18:03.540 --> 18:09.028
At a certain point, the Jim Jones, the Manson

18:09.599 --> 18:19.913
kind of leader, gets his followers, obviously there's some leadership at the outset, but gets his followers into a state of reduced responsibility.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.715
It's almost a mesmeric effect.

18:22.056 --> 18:27.583
It's more like a hypnotist than a real leader, although it's a mixture, obviously.

18:28.264 --> 18:37.176
So that by the end, they're doing, instead of seeking a goal together with the leader, they're just responding to stimuli, you know, as if they're Pavlov's dogs.

18:37.797 --> 18:40.119
It was not their goal to go kill ourselves.

18:40.419 --> 18:44.483
It was their goal to obey the leader no matter what.

18:44.503 --> 18:49.848
But most leadership situations have to have the leader and the followers going toward a goal.

18:50.448 --> 18:59.936
Now, if somebody disgusts me on television and I turn the television off, we're obviously not pursuing the same goal, even though I'm being influenced by him or her.

19:00.877 --> 19:07.483
Anyway, with Madonna, they said that, and so I talked this through with them that

19:08.037 --> 19:13.143
It was not her goal to have them wear clothes like her or something of that sort.

19:13.163 --> 19:16.646
It's her goal to entertain them, to get money, to do various things.

19:17.207 --> 19:24.015
Whereas Martha Graham, with whom, whose troupe she studied, by the way, Madonna, she started out as a dancer.

19:24.055 --> 19:36.328
So there were these parallels with Martha Graham that Martha Graham didn't only, was not only an artist who performed well and gave satisfaction to her audience, to her fans.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.010
An audience is not the same as a

19:38.260 --> 19:41.884
following their passive, they receive aesthetic pleasure.

19:42.524 --> 20:08.149
But she was deliberately creating a movement in favor of modern dance with a whole new art form, and trying to attract patrons and people who would not only come and watch her perform, but support that kind of dance in other areas, you know, all around her, and bringing into it artists like Noguchi

20:08.635 --> 20:22.313
So to lead a cause is quite different from simply being an artist who performs well and gives satisfaction.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.875
Is human nature a constant?

20:25.317 --> 20:37.613
I mean obviously when you go through history and you do describe the qualities which, like Machiavelli and all these others, is human nature a constant through history?

20:38.318 --> 20:38.658
No.

20:39.620 --> 20:50.033
There are obviously some things that are continuous, but one of my points is that leadership in one era wouldn't work in another.

20:50.113 --> 20:58.383
George Washington's kind of leadership wouldn't work today because his was a deferential society that mired a certain distance from him.

20:58.403 --> 21:02.628
It was not egalitarian as it had become even by the time of Lincoln.

21:03.089 --> 21:06.553
I give the example of Syrian holy men in the sixth century where people

21:06.972 --> 21:21.971
went and took the advice and followed the leadership of Simeon Stylides, starving himself on a pillar, because they figured anybody who could be so ascetic was that close to God, and therefore would have all this wisdom.

21:23.914 --> 21:34.347
I think that the mood of the sixties, a repressive mood that voted not only for Nixon but for George Wallace and Curtis LeMay and Spiro Agnew, was

21:34.833 --> 21:40.220
a time that was exploitable by Nixon's kind of leadership.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.863
At another time, it wouldn't have worked at all.

21:41.903 --> 21:50.615
You know, given a different period, I don't think Nixon would have been able to be a leader of the scale that he was then.

21:51.015 --> 21:59.847
So one of my arguments is that there's not one secret of leadership, one technique, one device, even in these various types.

22:00.348 --> 22:02.511
That's why Napoleon, for instance,

22:02.812 --> 22:06.337
He'd be very successful in the early part of his career, and not at the end.

22:06.677 --> 22:12.725
He hadn't changed, really, but the situation had, and he hadn't adapted his tactics to the situation.

22:12.845 --> 22:23.138
The kinds of warfare he waged when he was in charge of his army personally couldn't be waged when he was an emperor disposing of dozens of armies all over Europe.

22:24.460 --> 22:30.407
So you shouldn't look just at the leader.

22:30.468 --> 22:32.430
He's only one factor in the equations.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.663
It's the followers also, and the goal that's proposed at the time.

22:37.645 --> 22:41.349
And unless you get those three working together, you don't have leadership.

22:42.010 --> 22:53.424
And no matter what the internal qualities of the leader, if the followers aren't there, and the goal is not the kind that the followers can't aspire to, leadership won't occur.

22:55.306 --> 23:02.755
If you don't mind just commenting on the Gettysburg book.

23:04.186 --> 23:06.689
read to me almost as an inspired book.

23:08.171 --> 23:28.455
The idea to take these 272 words and just really examine how 272 words could have, I have to say, almost an inspired book, and talk a little bit about how that fits into the general

23:28.992 --> 23:44.507
corpus of Gary Will's... Well, I've always been intrigued by the idea that to understand a text from the past, you have to reconstruct the society around it, because the words all have a different weight and import.

23:45.828 --> 23:53.195
So I wrote a whole book on the Declaration of Independence, Inventing America.

23:53.435 --> 23:57.379
That was the one text, and I tried to reconstruct the society around it.

23:57.629 --> 24:10.284
This actually started in graduate school when I took a course from Bernard Knox on Euripides, and we spent the whole term on the Medea, the one play.

24:12.246 --> 24:14.409
He's wonderful.

24:14.429 --> 24:14.649
Yeah.

24:15.149 --> 24:26.843
Well, because that's so distant from us in time, it's necessary to recreate the whole attitude toward women, toward aliens,

24:27.228 --> 24:53.758
you know two barbarians she's a caucus she's a queen from caucus uh princess uh so unpacking the text uh reassembling the social atmosphere in which the text uh was originally performed uh is something that is a big assignment for a text like that well that's true even for something as it's only

24:54.093 --> 24:57.578
as distant from us as the middle of the 19th century.

24:59.821 --> 25:23.897
So my argument was that people's, the electric charge of different words because of transcendentalism, because of the rural cemetery movement, because of the arguments over the meaning of the people ruled by the people, was such that

25:24.282 --> 25:35.057
in order to get at the original text as experienced by the original audience, you have to rebuild their world around that text.

25:36.219 --> 25:40.484
And I would love to do that with other texts, but it's hard to find.

25:40.525 --> 25:47.194
You know, I've done it with the Declaration of Independence and with the Federalist Papers and now with the Guesberg Address.

25:47.915 --> 25:51.340
I can't think of another American sacred document to do it with.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.142
Imagine if this had been

25:53.425 --> 25:54.766
videotaped or something.

25:54.786 --> 26:00.751
It's amazing that it had such a profound effect, impact when it was delivered once.

26:00.771 --> 26:06.856
I mean, it was the radio, or was it the dissemination of a printed text?

26:06.916 --> 26:13.942
Yeah, it was a short text, so it could be printed, reprinted easily and often, and accurately.

26:13.962 --> 26:15.243
That's essential, too, isn't it?

26:15.263 --> 26:16.945
Sure, and accurately.

26:17.906 --> 26:23.010
See, Everett was very much worried with good cause that his text wouldn't be

26:23.176 --> 26:31.886
was not very accurate.

26:32.047 --> 26:51.630
For instance, the transcriptions of the Lincoln-Douglas debate are notoriously inaccurate because of the problems of transcribing them, but also because the two papers that they were reported in were blatantly biased and distorts attacks, one in favor of Lincoln and one in favor of Douglas.

26:51.813 --> 26:59.441
So the event took greater significance than what they had to say.

26:59.662 --> 27:00.142
Yeah.

27:00.242 --> 27:04.267
But with the Gatsberger drafts, it was easy to have an accurate copy.

27:04.847 --> 27:07.510
So people actually, they didn't really read what happened.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.773
And he probably furnished a copy.

27:09.793 --> 27:10.673
Oh, he did.

27:10.694 --> 27:17.601
We have five handwritten copies because he gave them to people to be celebrated.

27:18.087 --> 27:24.714
And also, it was connected, that cemetery was itself a big thing.

27:25.575 --> 27:34.786
You know, the states put it together, and it was a new idea that the bodies would not go back to the family graveyard.

27:35.406 --> 27:44.837
And Massachusetts was especially resistant to the idea, because, you know, there's a lot of family pride in these people, and they wanted to come home and lie in the family plot.

27:45.340 --> 27:55.129
So to have the idea that you're going to have a common grave at a time of states' rights, you know, the idea of a national body.

27:55.209 --> 28:00.534
So the occasion, clearly, it was much more, far more significant than we probably appreciate today.

28:00.554 --> 28:00.635
Yes.

28:00.655 --> 28:05.839
The occasion, it would have been a very big deal, even aside from the Gettysburg Address.

28:05.859 --> 28:06.860
And it continued to be.

28:07.041 --> 28:11.685
You know, the states all had to send their delegates to make the choice of the monument.

28:12.138 --> 28:15.743
And so it continued to be in the news, as it were, for years afterward.

28:16.684 --> 28:37.474
And then we kept to remember that Lincoln was shot only a little more than a year later, so that it became, along with the second inaugural, the lastâ€”see, I was often asked when I went around talking about that book, did Lincoln know what he had really accomplished with this?

28:38.235 --> 28:42.060
And I would say no, because he knew it was very good.

28:42.327 --> 28:44.550
He'd done his job, and it would have a big impact.

28:45.131 --> 28:55.125
But of course, he thought he was going to write a lot more speeches, and that they were going to be also very good, because he was becoming better and better all the time.

28:55.145 --> 29:00.232
He was growing as a writer and thinker and inspired leader.

29:01.374 --> 29:06.241
So he knew there were big tasks ahead all through Reconstruction and that kind of thing, and he would have to write.

29:06.281 --> 29:09.005
He'd have to top himself, or try to.

29:09.886 --> 29:11.929
But of course, all that was taken away when he was killed.

29:12.382 --> 29:22.013
So all we had was a kind of lapidary summary statement of his position in this one short address.

29:22.573 --> 29:25.136
And it took on an importance it wouldn't have had otherwise.

29:26.117 --> 29:34.727
And now to go back to the typical leadership book, is this a culmination of all the earlier

29:35.652 --> 29:37.334
Well, they'd certainly feed into it.

29:37.354 --> 29:44.081
I don't know if it's a combination, because again, like Lincoln, I want to go out and write other things, and we'll take some of these ideas farther.

29:47.524 --> 29:52.089
But in a way, it's a departure.

29:52.369 --> 30:01.879
I've been writing mainly about American culture, and this looks at some other things, too, aside from American culture.

30:02.433 --> 30:09.663
I suppose that some of the people I treat I might want to do more about, maybe something on Harriet Tubman.

30:11.185 --> 30:16.572
So nothing, no statement is final until you're dead.

30:17.092 --> 30:21.318
How do you, you mentioned Harriet Tubman.

30:21.358 --> 30:25.644
You primarily work with primary sources, I gather.

30:26.104 --> 30:29.689
You don't go in with any kind of notion about how you're

30:30.226 --> 30:31.348
How does things set up?

30:31.368 --> 30:35.915
No, with her, the sources are so exiguousâ€” That's a great word.

30:35.935 --> 30:39.120
That you have toâ€” How do you spell that word?

30:40.443 --> 30:51.420
You have to mine them pretty heavily, because unfortunately, you know, she couldn't write, so she left no documents herself.

30:52.082 --> 30:57.330
Her work was secret, so people didn't publicize it at the time.

30:58.154 --> 31:00.557
After the war, people tended to forget about her.

31:00.577 --> 31:04.040
You know, it's terrible that she died in the 20th century.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.922
And she could have been tape-recorded.

31:05.962 --> 31:06.963
We could hear her voice.

31:07.344 --> 31:10.607
We could hear her songs that she used as signals to the slaves.

31:11.789 --> 31:15.633
We could have heard Frederick Douglass could have been taped, and no man wasn't.

31:15.913 --> 31:19.176
These are tremendous historical losses.

31:19.197 --> 31:24.222
So with her, you have to look at what you have and discount some of the later things.

31:24.863 --> 31:27.165
For instance, some of the stuff written about her was written

31:28.124 --> 31:29.586
the war to get her a pension.

31:30.086 --> 31:35.072
And people exaggerated her services to the Union Army in order to try to get her a pension.

31:35.092 --> 31:38.877
And you can, you know, there are ways you can show that they were exaggerating.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.341
And they exaggerated the number of her missions and that kind of thing.

31:42.441 --> 31:43.402
And you don't have to do that.

31:43.442 --> 31:44.404
They were heroic enough.

31:45.885 --> 31:50.110
So, and I was surprised by certain things about her.

31:50.170 --> 31:55.617
For instance, we tend to think of her, or I guess maybe just I did, as

31:56.204 --> 32:03.794
deeply religious than she was, and maybe approximating Dr. King and being nonviolent.

32:04.115 --> 32:04.856
She wasn't a doll.

32:05.457 --> 32:06.438
She was violent.

32:06.558 --> 32:10.604
She went to rescue these people, and if anybody tried to stop her, she would shoot them.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.807
She'd carry a gun for that purpose.

32:13.107 --> 32:19.856
And if her members of her party tried to chicken out, she would force them to go ahead.

32:19.917 --> 32:24.323
She said before they took off, if you're coming with me, you're coming all the way.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.384
There's no turning around.

32:26.073 --> 32:31.558
And when somebody got frightened and tried to turn around, she pulled a gun out and said, I'm going home.

32:31.578 --> 32:35.301
She said, you can't go home, you're dead.

32:35.382 --> 32:36.583
It's a fascinating, yeah.

32:37.463 --> 32:38.625
So where would you start?

32:38.705 --> 32:53.418
I mean, how would you begin to build a life of, say, you have her interviews with Sarah Bradford.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.540
And some of that can't be checked.

32:55.942 --> 33:25.797
uh but some can for instance the story of the troy rescue in troy new york there are two newspaper accounts of that and so you there you have an independent uh way of checking the narrative and seeing that sarah bradford's pretty trustworthy there and uh and there was a lawyer who gave up who wrote a letter about it uh so there you have uh four sources for that story so that's the most uh

33:26.620 --> 33:53.522
accurate and uh authenticated story and from that you can extrapolate what she must have acted like because here we see her in action we see her improvising uh she she rescued this guy and then he's recaptured and she has to go and uh rescue him again and she's thinking on her feet and the poor guy faints and she picks him up and carries him you know she was very short but she was tough because she'd worked in the field

33:54.177 --> 33:58.425
And so she carried him downstairs and put him in a cart.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.510
And the cart gets away and she gets away.

34:01.993 --> 34:05.580
By the way, what's our... I'm supposed to be down there in ten minutes.

34:05.780 --> 34:07.083
We can walk as we go down.

34:07.123 --> 34:09.267
I wonder if you could inscribe... Yeah, let me go.
