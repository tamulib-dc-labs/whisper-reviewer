00:02.123 --> 00:19.305
Thank you.

00:21.175 --> 00:23.698
Hi, Mike Cuthbert here, one of the book guides.

00:24.018 --> 00:29.305
Alan Stipek and I have done a book segment on my talk shows on both commercial and public radio for many years.

00:29.865 --> 00:35.912
What started as a consumer feature was an entertainment feature, too, beginning with the first broadcast in 1978.

00:37.214 --> 00:44.643
What you're about to hear is a short selection of typical moments from several shows, moments in which an ordinary book show becomes something else.

00:45.343 --> 00:51.030
A representative hour program is on side, too, but for now, enjoy highlights of the book guides.

00:52.428 --> 01:01.634
We want to start this evening with one little feature before we get to the calls, and that is rare books and rare things, supposedly, not to be invested in.

01:01.694 --> 01:02.015
Right.

01:02.035 --> 01:03.399
Because they aren't good investments.

01:03.439 --> 01:04.643
What's high on your list, Alan?

01:04.663 --> 01:07.230
The highest on my list is Vanity Press Books.

01:07.598 --> 01:15.468
Do not assume that your Aunt Hattie's book on Fluffy the Cat is going to appreciate in value, or somebody else's Aunt Hattie.

01:15.928 --> 01:27.883
So if you go into these garage sales, into these book sales, and on the final day you see all the Vanity Press books, which have been looked over for the previous four days, all selling for 25 cents apiece, that's what they're worth.

01:29.125 --> 01:29.325
Okay.

01:29.565 --> 01:36.694
And this is an individual author, but this is the greatest faux pas, the other Winston Churchill.

01:37.585 --> 01:38.927
Who is the other Winston Churchill?

01:38.947 --> 01:42.233
The other Winston Churchill is an American writer from the turn of the century.

01:42.253 --> 01:42.573
Yeah.

01:42.594 --> 01:46.540
He wrote books like Richard Carvel, Soldiers of Fort... Hot Ice Cream?

01:46.560 --> 01:46.761
Yes.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.964
No, no, no.

01:49.004 --> 01:52.911
He wrote a series of novels from the turn of the century.

01:52.891 --> 02:05.844
The early Sir Winston Churchill books are from that same time period, and invariably you get people who think they have an early Sir Winston Churchill come running in, can't believe that they've gotten one of these scarce books.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.705
They're not scarce.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.147
They're not desirable.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.069
They're not in any way appreciable.

02:10.609 --> 02:12.511
They make great firewood, okay?

02:12.912 --> 02:18.578
Do not go out when you see Winston Churchill titles from the 1900s in the thrift shop and think you're buying the valuable books.

02:18.598 --> 02:19.999
Check out the title.

02:21.080 --> 02:21.801
Terrence Mann.

02:22.405 --> 02:24.408
Don't collect any books by Terrence Mann.

02:24.428 --> 02:24.769
Why?

02:24.789 --> 02:25.470
He didn't exist.

02:27.233 --> 02:30.998
He's the fictitious author in Fields of Dreams, right?

02:31.018 --> 02:31.159
Uh-huh.

02:31.339 --> 02:34.003
When that movie came out, people called our store, right?

02:34.043 --> 02:35.165
They wanted Terrence Mann.

02:35.505 --> 02:36.247
He doesn't exist.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.090
Well, now, wait a minute.

02:38.110 --> 02:38.550
He may.

02:38.951 --> 02:39.311
He may.

02:39.351 --> 02:42.336
But you've got a ball field to have him come back, right?

02:42.356 --> 02:43.258
Yeah, right.

02:43.278 --> 02:44.720
If he writes, he will come, right?

02:45.902 --> 02:49.948
Never buy textbooks, Reader's Digest condensed books, book clubs.

02:49.928 --> 02:56.115
Do not buy Harold Robbins, Jacqueline Suzanne, Danielle Steele, or any of those people.

02:56.396 --> 03:00.801
Not because you might not like the books, but nobody's going to buy them for first edition state.

03:00.821 --> 03:05.106
I have never seen a first edition of any of those authors ever sell.

03:05.326 --> 03:06.467
No kidding.

03:06.487 --> 03:06.868
They don't.

03:07.008 --> 03:08.249
Even though one of them is dead.

03:08.910 --> 03:09.511
Right.

03:09.751 --> 03:10.412
That's the way it is.

03:10.672 --> 03:11.413
Leroy Neiman.

03:12.625 --> 03:13.366
Fascinating.

03:13.386 --> 03:14.508
Leroy Neiman.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.910
He'll sign 50,000 books.

03:16.771 --> 03:17.372
Ah, okay.

03:17.972 --> 03:21.257
Those are more or less the ones that I would stay away from.

03:21.277 --> 03:21.758
Very good.

03:21.878 --> 03:23.741
Okay.

03:23.761 --> 03:30.550
We sometimes start a show with a short feature like the one you just heard, but most of the time, we're on the phones.

03:31.087 --> 03:33.671
Our number is 202-882-WRC1.

03:33.872 --> 03:36.556
There is one line open of our nine.

03:36.576 --> 03:38.359
Let's go to Geraldine in Darnstown.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.300
Good morning, Geraldine.

03:39.561 --> 03:40.162
Good morning.

03:40.603 --> 03:41.464
I have one book.

03:41.925 --> 03:42.305
Okay, good.

03:43.668 --> 03:46.412
Princess Mary's gift book on the front.

03:46.763 --> 03:55.499
At the bottom, it says, all profits on sale given to the Queens, quote, work for women, quote, fund.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.649
Is that the 18, excuse me, 1916, 1917?

04:00.709 --> 04:05.818
It has an inscription in the front to Barbara Gilson from so-and-so.

04:05.798 --> 04:08.584
January the 1st, 1916.

04:08.604 --> 04:09.345
Right.

04:09.566 --> 04:24.375
Princess Mary's and Queen Anne's books and King Albert's book were all books published in England during the First World War with all money going towards specific funds to help, in this case a woman's group, or for food.

04:24.596 --> 04:25.798
And they were all used...

04:25.778 --> 04:28.100
to help people who were victims of the First World War.

04:28.641 --> 04:35.928
And the books themselves have a compilation of poems and short stories and illustrations by people of the time.

04:36.789 --> 04:41.895
They sell anywhere from $15 to about $50, depending on the binding and the condition.

04:43.677 --> 04:48.762
What about if you wanted to take the plates out individually?

04:48.782 --> 04:49.603
No, no.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.824
No, no.

04:50.864 --> 04:52.866
You could, but I mean, I wouldn't...

04:53.302 --> 05:01.454
A lot of people do take plates out there because there's a Rackham plate in there, and there's a Willie Pagani plate in there, and I'm sure, I think, a Maxfield Parish.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.299
But they're not of any great value, those plates.

05:04.319 --> 05:07.303
They're reproductions, and they're nicer in the book.

05:08.385 --> 05:09.046
That's my opinion.

05:09.927 --> 05:11.850
Let's go to Julie from Falls Church.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.032
You're on WRC.

05:13.231 --> 05:14.815
Yes, I just have a quickie here.

05:14.875 --> 05:21.631
It's all the president's men, but it's signed by Carl Bernstein, by Bob Woodward, and Dustin Hoffman.

05:21.651 --> 05:25.220
Well, Dustin Hoffman puts it over the edge.

05:25.240 --> 05:25.401
Really?

05:25.441 --> 05:25.782
It does.

05:25.882 --> 05:30.092
I mean, now if you have Robert Redford, you have a nice association piece.

05:30.899 --> 05:37.406
The book itself, the first edition and the dust wrapper, would probably, with the two signatures, would sell for $25.

05:37.466 --> 05:42.752
With Dustin Hoffman, I'd say you probably could throw an extra $25, maybe $50 to it.

05:43.153 --> 05:45.135
We're into movies right now.

05:45.175 --> 05:50.921
We're doing a lot of 16- and 8-millimeter movies and books on movies in a magazine every month.

05:51.722 --> 05:55.427
And we're finding that there's a real strong market out there for collectibles.

05:55.887 --> 06:00.332
And so if I had that book, I'd probably throw it in the air for between $50 and $75.

06:01.105 --> 06:07.471
I just got a copy of The Man with the Golden Gun, signed by both Roger Moore and Sean Connery, the paperback.

06:07.631 --> 06:08.812
We priced that at over $100.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.094
And, of course, the older it is, the better.

06:11.555 --> 06:14.257
Which means I keep it for a long time or give it to my children.

06:14.437 --> 06:22.725
Well, you know, you don't want to be reading obituaries every day hoping that the three people who signed the book die, because that's what's going to put it over the edge.

06:23.486 --> 06:25.788
I don't think this is college tuition money.

06:27.469 --> 06:28.691
Let's go to Leslie next.

06:28.811 --> 06:29.111
Good morning.

06:29.131 --> 06:30.252
You're on WRC.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.331
Hi, I have here six books.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.727
They are soft brown leather.

06:38.095 --> 07:04.390
suede bindings they're called little journey yes little journeys by elbert hubbard the east aurora new york the roy crofters this one's 1901 right there are hundreds in the little journey series the roy crofters were craftsmen at the turn of the century and craftswoman who published and did all other forms of art um their printing was was well respected and still is and many people collect them

07:04.370 --> 07:14.953
Depending on the addition of the little journeys you have, it can run anywhere from $5 to $10 for an average binding all the way up to $100 to $200 for the sign-limited bindings.

07:15.490 --> 07:35.687
It sounds like you have a $5 to $10 one, unless you can see in the back, it's signed by Albert Hubbard with a very elaborate East Aurora, New York, Roy Croft, this emblem, which is, it says EA encircled in ink with like a pendulum-like bottom coming down next to his name.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.511
Okay, I'll look in the back.

07:37.531 --> 07:38.112
Sure thing.

07:38.172 --> 07:38.292
Okay.

07:38.356 --> 07:39.437
I wouldn't give them up.

07:39.598 --> 07:40.238
They're beautiful.

07:40.258 --> 07:40.879
They're great books.

07:41.119 --> 07:41.800
Thank you.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.421
Thank you very much.

07:42.701 --> 07:46.606
Once again, all nine of our lines are blinking, which means they're busy, and that's good.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.769
Let's go to Betty so we can get lots of folks on the air.

07:49.550 --> 07:50.331
Betty, can we help you?

07:50.411 --> 07:51.532
You're on WRC.

07:51.852 --> 07:55.136
Yes, I have a book which I bought in London in the middle 70s.

07:55.597 --> 07:56.959
It's a four-edged painting.

07:57.119 --> 07:57.479
Whoa.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.502
And it's bound in gold.

07:59.582 --> 08:02.305
I mean, the leaves are edged in gold.

08:02.622 --> 08:05.992
It's the 10th edition of Tennyson's Poems.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.822
And the publisher is, let me see here.

08:09.843 --> 08:11.949
Well, the book, let's get past the book.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.092
Let's get right to the painting.

08:13.413 --> 08:15.298
Is it a single or a double four-edge?

08:16.865 --> 08:17.546
I don't know.

08:17.606 --> 08:19.807
Okay, a single fore... You mean either way?

08:19.848 --> 08:20.848
Yeah, either way is a double.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.869
Oh, I really don't know.

08:22.210 --> 08:22.910
I really don't know.

08:23.050 --> 08:27.294
Okay, well, obviously, you know you have a single fore-edge when you turn the fore-edge in one direction.

08:27.354 --> 08:27.774
That's right.

08:27.794 --> 08:30.577
Now, turning to the other direction, you have another image.

08:31.117 --> 08:32.959
That would be a double fore-edge painting.

08:32.979 --> 08:33.579
Oh, I see.

08:33.599 --> 08:33.959
Okay.

08:33.979 --> 08:38.103
And, Betty, would you mind for one second, let me explain to the listeners what a fore-edge painting is?

08:38.123 --> 08:38.323
All right.

08:38.643 --> 08:46.450
A fore-edge painting is a painting which was done, started in England in the Victorian times, where...

08:46.767 --> 08:56.563
An artist would paint on the fore edge or the side of the book a painting which could not be seen unless the pages were kind of flipped and held together.

08:57.304 --> 09:05.637
And if you are a book collector, this is a serendipitous surprise to a lot of people when they find old leatherback books from the 1800s.

09:05.903 --> 09:08.407
And they turn the pages and they see these four edges.

09:08.487 --> 09:11.412
Some of the four edge paintings will sell into the thousands of dollars.

09:12.354 --> 09:18.484
They are still a program, not program, but there are still four edge painters in England who are doing them at the present time.

09:19.766 --> 09:20.768
Betty, have you found it?

09:20.808 --> 09:21.910
Do you have a double four edge?

09:22.030 --> 09:22.831
I have a single.

09:22.851 --> 09:23.312
A single.

09:23.352 --> 09:23.973
What is the image?

09:24.654 --> 09:25.195
It's the 10.

09:27.487 --> 09:28.168
F-O-R-D.

09:28.248 --> 09:29.570
Right.

09:29.590 --> 09:30.591
Mm-hmm.

09:30.651 --> 09:33.915
And the book is about 10 inches in height?

09:33.936 --> 09:34.957
Yes, I would say so.

09:34.977 --> 09:35.117
Right.

09:35.197 --> 09:37.320
And it's blue Moroccan leather.

09:37.340 --> 09:37.480
Right.

09:37.801 --> 09:38.582
That's a nice book.

09:38.642 --> 09:43.829
I mean, I would say that if it was an 18th century forage, and I can't tell without seeing it.

09:43.969 --> 09:44.730
It's 1855.

09:44.770 --> 09:45.050
1855.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.472
Oh, the book is 1855.

09:46.492 --> 09:47.714
Oh, yes.

09:47.814 --> 09:51.739
Well, we don't know if the forage is, in fact, the new forage or was actually painted...

09:51.719 --> 09:54.286
at that time without seeing it.

09:54.386 --> 10:00.000
If it was, I would say that image would sell anywhere between $500 to $1,500.

10:00.461 --> 10:04.512
And again, I'm putting a parameter because I haven't seen the image itself.

10:04.752 --> 10:05.895
Is that for the single edge?

10:05.915 --> 10:06.838
That's for the single edge.

10:06.858 --> 10:07.720
Yeah, but can I bring it in?

10:07.700 --> 10:08.341
sometime.

10:08.361 --> 10:11.025
I'd be more than happy to take a look at it in the early 19th century.

10:11.045 --> 10:11.746
Thank you very much, sir.

10:12.647 --> 10:13.889
Let's go to Alexandria.

10:13.909 --> 10:15.070
Craig, you're on WRC.

10:15.251 --> 10:16.232
Okay, thank you, Mike.

10:16.853 --> 10:37.101
Ellen, I have a small, probably about four inches by seven inch, leather-bound book, and it's called A Biographical Antidotes of Founders of the French Republic and of other eminent characters who have distinguished themselves during the progress of the Revolution.

10:37.482 --> 10:37.622
Mm-hmm.

10:37.670 --> 10:44.400
And at the bottom of the page, it says, Philadelphia, printed for Matthew Carey.

10:44.701 --> 10:45.081
Really?

10:45.282 --> 10:50.189
Comma, number 118, Market Street.

10:50.209 --> 10:52.273
1803 is the date on the bottom.

10:52.293 --> 10:53.454
Now, there's no publisher.

10:54.456 --> 10:55.317
You wouldn't have a publisher.

10:55.357 --> 10:56.038
You'd have a printer.

10:56.279 --> 10:56.800
A printer, okay.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.764
Yeah, something printed for Matthew Carey would be, that's all you would need.

11:00.185 --> 11:00.285
Okay.

11:01.143 --> 11:12.312
Obviously, it's a leatherback book, and it's probably something that we would sell in the store between $50 to $100 without doing any research.

11:12.332 --> 11:12.513
Okay.

11:12.533 --> 11:15.962
Anything on the French Revolution, we can give a little information here.

11:16.229 --> 11:29.683
One of the interesting things about the French Revolution, that during the period of the Republic, books that were published in France are published by, not the date, not by the calendar date, 1799, 1800, by the date of the Republic.

11:29.743 --> 11:35.770
So it would be anno 1, anno 2, anno 3, anno 4 for the, what is it, 17 years of the Republic?

11:35.910 --> 11:46.101
And so if you have a book in French from that time period and you can't figure out why it has this peculiar date, it's because it's been printed specially for the French Republic.

11:46.081 --> 11:46.742
Okay.

11:47.484 --> 11:50.309
Okay, but this was printed in English.

11:50.410 --> 11:50.590
Right.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.035
And, yeah, again, a $50 to $100 book.

11:53.235 --> 11:53.736
Okay, great.

11:53.756 --> 11:54.097
Thank you.

11:54.117 --> 11:54.778
Thank you very much.

11:55.159 --> 11:56.622
Let's go back to our phones now.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.786
And Steve in Washington, you're on WRC.

11:58.987 --> 11:59.908
Yes, good afternoon.

12:00.730 --> 12:05.760
First, about 27, 8, 9 years ago, I was in Madrid.

12:05.740 --> 12:12.650
And I was at El Prado Museum and there was Salvador Dali who finally consented to sign my catalog.

12:13.231 --> 12:15.354
He also spoke to me, but it's true.

12:15.394 --> 12:17.757
There's no way to understand what the man was saying.

12:17.777 --> 12:19.680
And it wasn't Spanish either.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.741
I know a little Spanish.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.525
He was speaking some other tongue of his own.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.188
Now, I just found it again.

12:25.648 --> 12:26.770
Does that have any value?

12:26.750 --> 12:33.539
I had a personal relationship, not a personal relationship, but I met Salvador Dali also once.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.265
And I have to tell you, he does speak a language all the time.

12:38.465 --> 12:40.608
He should have been a politician.

12:40.628 --> 12:42.851
If you could understand him.

12:45.134 --> 12:49.500
About 30 years ago, that puts you in the 60s.

12:49.868 --> 12:51.871
He was signing his books at that time.

12:51.991 --> 12:57.519
Books that he had printed in the 70s were mostly forged.

12:57.539 --> 13:02.986
And there's a wonderful story, which if I capsulated would probably take three minutes, so I can't even tell you the story.

13:03.587 --> 13:08.414
But there was a printer, a publisher in London or in Paris who was signing all his works.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.475
He was his publisher.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.440
If you have an actual signature and you know you were there.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.401
Oh, I was there.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.564
Then you can figure that it's worth at least $100.

13:15.584 --> 13:16.365
Really?

13:16.345 --> 13:16.886
Yeah.

13:16.906 --> 13:17.907
And I was throwing it away.

13:18.067 --> 13:18.587
Well, I wouldn't.

13:18.888 --> 13:19.128
All right.

13:19.148 --> 13:22.251
Now, finally, this is a general question which may help your other listeners.

13:23.152 --> 13:26.756
I bought a house 25 years ago from a woman who was 98.

13:26.836 --> 13:31.721
I never met her, but she was an extraordinary person and extremely educated.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.985
And I kept a bunch of books for reasons I know not why.

13:35.025 --> 13:38.289
They were somewhere in a basement, and I really want to get rid of them.

13:38.349 --> 13:45.636
The fact that a book is old, about 100 years or so old, doesn't give it any value, does it?

13:45.656 --> 13:46.217
That's correct.

13:46.197 --> 13:55.995
I mean, I'm perfectly willing to throw them away, but the thought of throwing out poor Ethel Barry, that really, she inscribed each of her books as she was a marvelous woman.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.580
Would it take me to call you and see?

13:58.680 --> 14:01.525
I mean, I'd even donate it somewhere if it was any value.

14:01.605 --> 14:09.319
What we do is we have a list of different charitable organizations and libraries in the area that take books, that sell them.

14:09.299 --> 14:22.651
for that specific charity, or in fact, like the Wheaton Library, we donate books on a weekly basis for our customers, and they have a weekly book sale, and that money goes towards buying books for the library and for maintenance.

14:22.671 --> 14:27.756
And if you have any books, I mean, any listener out here, there's no reason to throw anything away.

14:27.796 --> 14:30.638
There's a way to recycle it, and we do help people out.

14:30.678 --> 14:36.243
We do weekly runs for various charitable organizations, and we'll help you and pick up the books and write a donation for you.

14:36.684 --> 14:36.844
Fine.

14:37.164 --> 14:38.045
Well, thank you very much.

14:38.265 --> 14:39.306
Thank you for your call.

14:39.286 --> 14:47.357
