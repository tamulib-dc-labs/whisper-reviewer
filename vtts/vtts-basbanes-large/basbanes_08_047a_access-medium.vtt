WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:06.192
That's okay with you.

00:06.413 --> 00:08.535
I'll just leave this.

00:09.136 --> 00:10.718
Here, you're a Bostonian.

00:10.798 --> 00:12.200
It's kind of a homecoming.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.583
Yes, I know this neighborhood very, very well.

00:14.603 --> 00:17.787
I used to sell newspapers, various corners around me.

00:17.827 --> 00:28.240
My brother and I worked on the corner of Wilson and Arlington, a block away from here, on Sunday mornings, from 6 or 7 in the morning until about noon or 1 o'clock when church let out.

00:29.001 --> 00:30.763
And in the winter, it was cold.

00:31.283 --> 00:33.207
It was a very cold job.

00:33.227 --> 00:33.988
We used to rotate.

00:34.028 --> 00:40.159
I would do a couple of hours and he would come and spell me for a couple of hours so I could go get warm and then I would come back and spell him.

00:41.462 --> 00:42.644
I know the area very well.

00:42.744 --> 00:43.826
I love Boston.

00:43.866 --> 00:45.149
I love it a lot.

00:45.169 --> 00:48.274
The weather seems to have been so accommodating for you.

00:48.294 --> 00:49.356
That is wonderful.

00:49.376 --> 00:49.917
Wonderful.

00:51.140 --> 00:54.085
Michael Crichton, who I've interviewed a number of times,

00:54.622 --> 01:01.149
In fact, I was following him around when he did his homecoming in Roslyn, Long Island, a couple of weeks ago.

01:01.169 --> 01:07.336
And one of the kids at the school said, asked him a cliche question about living with celebrities.

01:07.496 --> 01:10.199
And he said, the toughest thing is going out to eat.

01:10.219 --> 01:11.981
Just sitting there.

01:12.022 --> 01:14.765
You're constantly being watched.

01:15.405 --> 01:18.148
Well, I'll tell you, it's an interesting thing.

01:18.309 --> 01:24.055
I don't have anywhere near as much problem these days as I did

01:24.575 --> 01:27.119
In the 70s and 80s.

01:28.521 --> 01:36.271
I'm not really sure why, whether people feel I'm less approachable or whether I'm less recognizable.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.373
I'm not sure which of you.

01:38.314 --> 01:43.382
But there was a time in the 70s and 80s when it was very difficult to go out in public.

01:43.562 --> 01:48.709
When my Star Trek era was extremely intense.

01:48.993 --> 01:50.755
And it was difficult.

01:50.835 --> 01:53.439
It was difficult to have a meal in a public restaurant.

01:53.639 --> 01:55.662
These days, I'm very comfortable in public.

01:55.802 --> 01:58.145
I have no problem.

01:58.225 --> 02:04.293
Are people who normally recognize you, are they my age, generally, or do you find younger people who know you?

02:04.533 --> 02:11.081
I find, I would say, from mid-20s up.

02:11.102 --> 02:12.043
Not the little kids.

02:12.103 --> 02:16.148
The little kids, I think, are watching more of the current show, the next generation show.

02:16.482 --> 02:18.745
But mid-20s up, maybe 30-ish up.

02:18.845 --> 02:23.932
It's impossible to have anticipated anything like this, is it?

02:23.952 --> 02:24.072
No.

02:24.092 --> 02:27.096
No, it was quite shocking, actually.

02:27.116 --> 02:28.017
Quite shocking.

02:28.037 --> 02:34.846
We became a news event in the 70s when the show went into syndication.

02:34.926 --> 02:36.188
Everybody thought we were gone.

02:36.228 --> 02:41.595
The show went into syndication and became this extraordinarily successfully syndicated show.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.939
We were all pleasantly surprised.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.101
Suddenly it was...

02:47.127 --> 02:48.689
It was coming back at us.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.492
We finished the show in the 68.

02:51.692 --> 02:55.696
I thought a couple of years of reruns and we'd be gone.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.818
And it seemed to be heading that way.

02:57.858 --> 03:04.105
And then suddenly around 72, 73, 74, there was this new upsurge of interest.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.746
And it's never stopped since.

03:05.766 --> 03:07.889
Do you have any kind of an explanation for it?

03:07.989 --> 03:13.274
Any kind of insight into the phenomenon?

03:13.294 --> 03:13.815
Interesting.

03:13.835 --> 03:15.296
It's an interesting issue.

03:15.497 --> 03:16.898
I've gone through various

03:17.789 --> 03:21.354
permutations and my reaction to that question.

03:22.937 --> 03:26.462
I think there are a lot of elements.

03:26.482 --> 03:30.167
I don't think there's any one singular element.

03:30.688 --> 03:36.196
I think the audience, in our case, I'm not speaking to The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine or Voyager.

03:36.257 --> 03:40.263
I can't really speak intelligently about that.

03:40.283 --> 03:46.632
But in our case, I think that we had a family chemistry, a family of characters,

03:47.152 --> 03:57.847
that the audience enjoyed revisiting, a group of professional people working together in unison to solve problems.

03:59.009 --> 04:14.391
I think that we were a haven in a way in that the society that we represented still had a clear perception of the difference between right and wrong.

04:14.877 --> 04:20.464
and knew what had to be done, the appropriate thing.

04:20.584 --> 04:23.688
We were not a situational ethics kind of group.

04:23.768 --> 04:36.244
It's such an excellent point, because one thing I always enjoyed about them, and have enjoyed them, and I'm not a trick, but I suspect I've seen them all at some point over the years.

04:36.443 --> 04:44.845
is that there's always a moral point to be made, there's a purpose, and very rarely is there a frivolous, there were a couple of frivolous.

04:44.866 --> 04:49.558
But for the most part, you're right, there was a morality, and the morality was a constant, you could count on it.

04:50.011 --> 04:53.900
It was not a morality that shifted depending on who was in office or what was expedient.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.769
And we were a meritocracy.

04:58.050 --> 05:01.779
The people who did the job were the people who were the appropriate people for the job.

05:01.799 --> 05:05.107
They were qualified to do the job and got the job because they were qualified.

05:05.127 --> 05:07.553
You had a bit of time, by the way, when you think about it.

05:07.633 --> 05:07.733
Yeah.

05:07.713 --> 05:08.714
Yeah.

05:08.734 --> 05:13.662
There was a moral, a social... You had an African-American woman... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:13.702 --> 05:14.743
Very good mix.

05:14.964 --> 05:22.234
Yeah, totally acceptable mix of people based on merit, based on talent, the ability to do the job.

05:22.835 --> 05:24.297
Do you think this was inspired?

05:24.417 --> 05:32.769
I mean, was this an inspiration, or was it kind of a hopeful projection of a part of the creative... I think both.

05:32.849 --> 05:33.591
I think both.

05:33.611 --> 05:34.632
I think...

05:35.708 --> 05:39.592
Roddenberry had a very, very wonderful vision.

05:41.234 --> 05:45.819
He himself was a complex, very complex man.

05:47.661 --> 05:52.326
But he had this wonderful idea that where it came from, I'll never know.

05:53.847 --> 06:05.580
The wonderful idea was that humanity would continue to improve, that the moral society would continue to improve, and that

06:05.830 --> 06:24.969
in the 23rd century, the period of Star Trek, that there would be a minimal amount of political influence, of avariciousness, of greed, of racial distrust or animosity.

06:25.769 --> 06:26.430
That was gone.

06:26.490 --> 06:27.851
It was just gone.

06:27.891 --> 06:28.452
It was over.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.333
It was a thing of the past.

06:30.013 --> 06:31.635
And that...

06:31.733 --> 06:34.516
What was left was dealing with circumstances together.

06:34.956 --> 06:42.264
Circumstances could present problems, but individuals in the human society didn't, unless there was some kind of aberration.

06:42.865 --> 06:45.487
I mean, some really interesting or serious aberration.

06:45.507 --> 06:51.073
Something had gone terribly wrong with an individual, not necessarily with a group or a race.

06:52.234 --> 06:56.779
There were other races, like the Klingons, for example, who were a perpetual problem.

06:57.434 --> 06:58.917
Were they evils?

07:00.260 --> 07:03.066
I don't think, yeah, that's an interesting question.

07:03.106 --> 07:09.901
The Klingons, for me, also were complex, extremely paranoid, paranoid.

07:10.502 --> 07:14.751
And the evil sprang from paranoia, and it sprang from this terrible fear.

07:15.203 --> 07:21.553
that they were being misjudged, that they were being, that they were under threat and siege all the time.

07:21.593 --> 07:22.935
They were a siege mentality.

07:24.237 --> 07:25.799
There's somebody always after us.

07:25.880 --> 07:31.288
There's somebody always trying to do us wrong, so we must do what we,

07:31.623 --> 07:35.730
In our civilization, during the Vietnam War, called anticipatory retaliation.

07:35.770 --> 07:40.518
Before they do us injury, which we know they're going to, we will hurt them.

07:40.538 --> 07:41.960
You're talking about an oxymoron?

07:41.980 --> 07:43.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:43.843 --> 07:46.207
Anticipatory retaliation, I remember that very well.

07:46.227 --> 07:50.094
Well, I was a Navy press officer in an aircraft carrier.

07:50.114 --> 07:51.276
Yeah, so you know what I'm talking about.

07:51.336 --> 07:54.020
I used to coin these places.

07:54.060 --> 07:54.541
Yeah.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.984
It was the job.

07:56.805 --> 07:56.905
Yeah.

07:59.500 --> 08:04.765
There's almost a mea culpa element in the new book.

08:05.025 --> 08:05.345
Really?

08:05.566 --> 08:06.066
Well, no, no.

08:06.126 --> 08:10.370
I mean, where I am not Spock, but now I am Spock.

08:11.791 --> 08:11.892
Yeah.

08:11.912 --> 08:13.653
Well, you have to have a little sense of humor.

08:13.673 --> 08:15.295
I think that's great.

08:16.516 --> 08:26.385
I guess what really, really genuinely interests me, as one who writes about authors, is this...

08:26.838 --> 08:37.973
I think this has to be the first time in my experience of close to 1,000 interviews over the years where I'm actually talking with a person with a character.

08:38.394 --> 08:44.522
So the character has really, where does one cease being the character?

08:44.542 --> 08:48.808
And if we could just talk and enter this conversation.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.852
I don't think there's any more division between me and the character.

08:51.872 --> 08:55.697
I think it's all gone away, and I think that's why I was comfortable using this title.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.803
I really, it took a long time for me to come to this title.

08:59.945 --> 09:02.689
The other book, the... Intellectually, emotionally?

09:02.829 --> 09:03.610
Emotionally, both.

09:03.791 --> 09:05.493
Both, yeah.

09:06.474 --> 09:08.998
The other title was published in 1975.

09:09.158 --> 09:10.120
It's been 20 years.

09:11.201 --> 09:19.533
The other title was not really a disclaimer, although I must have been going through some kind of a complex process at the time, perhaps unconsciously.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.759
I didn't think of it as a disclaimer book or a rejection book.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.802
I thought it was...

09:26.086 --> 09:30.552
I thought the title was of interest and had some merit because it was a fact.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.815
A simple, real fact.

09:32.835 --> 09:34.056
I was not Spock.

09:34.697 --> 09:37.601
And in a sense, even today, I'm not really, you know.

09:38.702 --> 09:41.205
People recognize me as the actor who played the character.

09:42.327 --> 09:48.455
And I am more Spock-like today than I was when I started out.

09:48.535 --> 09:54.102
Oh, I've become much more rational and much more comfortable with my skin.

09:54.554 --> 09:57.119
Spock as a character that was comfortable in his skin.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.629
And I knew who he was, had a great sense of himself and a great sense of security.

10:03.832 --> 10:05.375
I had to evolve to that.

10:05.415 --> 10:13.530
I was a much more driven, needful, growing person.

10:13.550 --> 10:14.332
I was growing up.

10:14.432 --> 10:16.596
It's been taking a long time growing up.

10:16.981 --> 10:18.763
Actors are that way.

10:18.983 --> 10:21.907
What was the consternation on your part?

10:22.287 --> 10:24.129
I think we're talking 20 years ago.

10:24.149 --> 10:27.072
You were, I guess, in your 40s at that point.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.474
Yeah, yeah.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.696
And, you know, the career still had an arc to it.

10:30.716 --> 10:31.858
There were still questions.

10:31.878 --> 10:33.119
There were still unanswered questions.

10:33.219 --> 10:34.240
How will this affect me?

10:34.260 --> 10:35.181
Will I be okay?

10:35.282 --> 10:36.703
Will I be able to make a living?

10:37.784 --> 10:45.553
During the making of the series, even at the height of the Spock popularity, which was quite intense,

10:46.225 --> 10:49.269
there were people saying to me, what are you going to do when this is over?

10:50.971 --> 11:00.263
And I discerned in there somewhere a concern for me as though I was going to have a problem.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.565
Did you anticipate it at all?

11:01.585 --> 11:06.131
I didn't anticipate it, but I then became conscious of the fact that I shouldn't.

11:06.511 --> 11:09.535
People in effect were saying to me, look out, look out.

11:10.556 --> 11:14.121
Well, it was an interesting process.

11:14.281 --> 11:15.743
When Star Trek was finished,

11:16.904 --> 11:24.357
The first job that I was offered, and I jumped at it, was a job on Mission Impossible.

11:24.377 --> 11:33.053
And I jumped at it because the role that I would be playing was a character who portrayed a lot of other characters.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.499
And I thought, well, now I'll be able to...

11:36.935 --> 11:45.384
pull out the old actor kid bag and go to work and do a lot of other things and maybe deflect some of this very intense spark image.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.947
Were you mindfully trying to shed the air?

11:48.007 --> 11:48.368
Yeah.

11:48.528 --> 11:49.829
In Mission Impossible, I was.

11:50.270 --> 11:50.570
I was.

11:51.471 --> 11:52.733
I don't think it caused a ripple.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.975
I don't think anybody cared.

11:54.995 --> 11:59.840
I was sort of an invisible character.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.183
And what was fascinating about that experience was

12:03.007 --> 12:10.456
But because I was portraying a character named Paris who portrayed other characters in all the charades, Paris didn't exist.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.499
Nobody knew me by Paris.

12:13.640 --> 12:17.705
Paris immediately put on a mask and became another character.

12:17.725 --> 12:26.996
So it was as though I had a good job and I was having a good time doing all these dialects and playing all these characterizations and so forth.

12:27.016 --> 12:28.578
But it had no impact.

12:28.598 --> 12:29.419
And...

12:30.209 --> 12:36.114
After a couple of years of it, I became bored because the characters that Paris portrayed had no inner life.

12:37.295 --> 12:38.336
They were all superficial.

12:38.356 --> 12:40.518
They were charade characters.

12:40.538 --> 12:52.548
And once I had done 25 of them, as I did, or 40 of them, as I did in two seasons, I did two seasons, and then that was enough.

12:52.568 --> 12:59.794
I began to see the same characters coming around again, the same European dictator and the same Asian dictator and the same Cuban dictator, you know, and I thought,

13:00.128 --> 13:03.734
The same blind man or the same crippled man and whatever.

13:03.754 --> 13:05.296
And I thought, that's enough.

13:05.316 --> 13:05.917
I've done that.

13:06.298 --> 13:10.405
I have to believe what nobody anticipated is this word syndication.

13:10.906 --> 13:11.246
Yeah.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.889
I mean, you talk about Mission Impossible.

13:12.989 --> 13:14.932
Now, my kids, they're a bit prominent.

13:14.952 --> 13:15.052
Yeah.

13:15.112 --> 13:17.416
They're vaguely familiar with it.

13:17.436 --> 13:19.419
We'll see something every once in a while.

13:19.439 --> 13:19.540
Yeah.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.845
My younger daughter will say, well, that's mission of a theme, you know.

13:22.825 --> 13:23.305
Yeah.

13:23.325 --> 13:27.129
But there's no ambiguity when it comes to starch.

13:27.269 --> 13:28.310
No, that's right.

13:28.430 --> 13:36.518
And so who would have anticipated that it would even become greater, almost synergistic in a way that, I mean, when you talk, pardon me.

13:36.538 --> 13:37.679
Hi, honey.

13:37.699 --> 13:39.081
This is my wife, Susan.

13:39.101 --> 13:40.522
Pleasure to meet you.

13:40.542 --> 13:40.863
Hi.

13:40.883 --> 13:42.864
You going to join us?

13:43.065 --> 13:43.385
No, no.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.488
Are you going out somewhere?

13:46.548 --> 13:50.672
Anyway, we're back on.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.710
No, there's no ambiguity about Star Trek, you're right.

13:54.730 --> 13:55.751
The mission thing went away.

13:55.892 --> 14:02.942
Anyway, to just close the point, this question of concern about the future, I left Mission Impossible after two seasons.

14:04.525 --> 14:10.554
And I left because I didn't feel that I was, I wasn't being fed anything except making a good living.

14:11.255 --> 14:13.639
And when I left, I then had a year

14:14.530 --> 14:19.958
which demonstrated to me that I could have the kind of actual life that I had fantasized about.

14:19.978 --> 14:27.228
In 1971, after two years on mission, I did in the following order.

14:27.328 --> 14:31.033
I did a Western in Spain with you, Brenner.

14:32.074 --> 14:44.031
I did a tour around the East Coast here, including Beverly and Hyannis and other cities as Tevye and Fiddler on the Roof.

14:44.686 --> 14:50.154
I then went to London and did a two-hour television movie, which was quite successful.

14:50.174 --> 14:57.504
And then from there, I went to the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and played the lead in a man in a glass booth.

14:57.524 --> 15:03.733
So I had a movie, I had a musical, I had a TV movie, and a drama that year.

15:04.875 --> 15:09.361
And I thought I'm a very, very happy camp.

15:10.423 --> 15:12.145
I'm welcome, and...

15:12.563 --> 15:15.189
the movies, I'm welcoming television, I'm welcoming the theater.

15:15.970 --> 15:26.674
And particularly the latter was important to me because I thought I had a lot of exploration to do as an actor on stage, which is how I started acting here on stage in Boston.

15:26.694 --> 15:30.943
So from then on, it was just the process of working my way through

15:31.801 --> 15:36.588
the work that I wanted to do, and finding and making selections.

15:36.608 --> 15:40.273
And I made some mistakes along the way, but by and large it's a great ride.

15:40.673 --> 15:45.580
So to use that phrase again, the iconic of your career, you're satisfied.

15:45.941 --> 15:48.625
Oh yeah, oh yeah, and then some, and then some.

15:48.745 --> 15:53.151
I left here with a dream of making a living as an actor.

15:53.603 --> 15:56.227
I understand your parents were opposed to that.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.091
Oh, oh, oh, that was very painful.

15:59.111 --> 15:59.872
That was a drama.

16:00.072 --> 16:01.394
That was very painful.

16:01.414 --> 16:05.199
My parents were very upset, very upset.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.381
On two accounts.

16:06.581 --> 16:16.615
First, that I wanted to become an actor instead of what they had dreamed would be some kind of a professional career, stable career.

16:17.597 --> 16:21.282
And then that I was leaving at age 18 going 3,000 miles away.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.152
to the West Coast.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.794
That was very bad for them.

16:26.076 --> 16:37.971
With that description on page 210, where this is the scene, it's the final scene where Spock is taking Lee from Kirk.

16:38.251 --> 16:38.491
Yeah.

16:38.972 --> 16:47.042
That, I mean, I respect that you approached it as a professional, but I wonder if you could describe any personal feelings that you might have had.

16:47.062 --> 16:49.065
Tell me which scene you're referring to.

16:49.165 --> 16:50.847
Well, the scene where he's dying.

16:51.063 --> 16:56.213
Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, okay, okay, Star Trek II, yes, okay.

16:57.355 --> 17:01.964
It was a very stressful day.

17:02.345 --> 17:04.669
I had very mixed feelings about it.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.673
I had agreed, obviously, to do this.

17:08.296 --> 17:13.847
I had one abiding fear about those movies.

17:14.907 --> 17:28.728
And that was that having done a dignified body of work in the television series, my fear was a degradation of that body of work in the movies.

17:30.110 --> 17:36.000
I thought I didn't know really what the level of the work would be, the level of the quality, the level of the lighting.

17:37.282 --> 17:39.325
I was very disappointed with the first movie.

17:39.345 --> 17:41.488
I thought it was a very troubled script.

17:41.958 --> 17:48.405
a script not in touch with itself, a story that was misaligned and misconceived.

17:49.306 --> 17:51.508
The character of Spock was never realized.

17:51.568 --> 17:54.511
I don't think any of the characters would have fully realized in the first movie.

17:56.013 --> 18:05.923
And when they came to us and said they wanted to do another movie, I think I wrote in the book, and it's true, I was very concerned that they're thinking they would get one more bite out of the apple before the whole thing dies.

18:06.483 --> 18:08.726
And I thought, oh, God.

18:08.746 --> 18:10.868
And I was really worried.

18:11.810 --> 18:17.579
But if I didn't do it, I would be perceived as the one naysayer of the group.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.500
The male content.

18:18.761 --> 18:19.582
Yeah, exactly.

18:19.602 --> 18:20.784
And I didn't want that role.

18:20.984 --> 18:23.308
I really didn't want that role.

18:23.328 --> 18:26.913
So I kind of had to come aboard.

18:27.935 --> 18:32.582
When Harv Bennett said to me, how would you like to have a great death scene?

18:32.602 --> 18:39.512
It set up a whole thought process that really, as I today look back on it, it was very interesting.

18:39.573 --> 18:40.534
I thought to myself,

18:41.813 --> 18:50.487
Perhaps this is a, again, I was looking for dignity here somewhere, and I thought maybe this was a dignified way out of this dilemma.

18:50.708 --> 19:00.964
If this could very well be the last movie, why don't we, if I can find, if they can give me some valiant way to go out here with some stature, I'll do that.

19:01.325 --> 19:03.889
I'd rather do that than string along.

19:04.308 --> 19:06.271
worrying each movie.

19:06.291 --> 19:07.613
I'm a worrier in that respect.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.716
I worry about what the script is going to be.

19:09.796 --> 19:11.659
I don't get excited when they're going to make another movie.

19:11.679 --> 19:12.200
I get scared.

19:13.382 --> 19:14.464
What's the script going to be?

19:14.484 --> 19:15.445
That's what I want to know.

19:15.465 --> 19:16.306
What's the story?

19:16.366 --> 19:17.668
What role will we play?

19:18.970 --> 19:27.724
So when he made this comment, a great death scene, well, that's an oxymoron too, isn't it?

19:27.784 --> 19:29.947
How do you have a great death scene where you're dying?

19:30.268 --> 19:33.032
How great can that be?

19:33.299 --> 19:36.042
But in any case, I thought, let's try this.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.085
Let's try this.

19:38.105 --> 19:41.950
And I was quite happy with the way that story was constructed.

19:42.991 --> 19:44.353
And it was a wonderful scene.

19:44.373 --> 19:45.694
It was a very touching scene.

19:45.775 --> 19:51.041
And it had a certain amount of, it had integrity about it.

19:51.101 --> 19:53.244
It had a certain amount of inevitability about it.

19:53.504 --> 19:58.210
And when a scene like that has that inevitability, then you feel, OK, then we're doing the right scene.

19:58.544 --> 19:59.827
It's not arbitrary.

19:59.948 --> 20:00.930
It wasn't arbitrary.

20:01.131 --> 20:04.639
It wasn't, okay, now let's kill it.

20:04.659 --> 20:15.186
So we did it, and it was a very trying day, because by the time we got to playing that scene, it was clear that we were making a pretty good movie.

20:15.588 --> 20:17.811
Now I thought, whoa.

20:18.131 --> 20:23.517
Have I just gotten off a great train ride here?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.719
So how do you resolve that?

20:26.921 --> 20:28.603
There was no way to resolve at the time.

20:28.703 --> 20:35.370
I had to go through with what we had agreed to do, do it as best we could, and wait and see what was going to happen.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.152
And what happened was very interesting.

20:37.172 --> 20:39.435
When the film was tested,

20:41.018 --> 20:46.027
The picture played very well until Spock's death, and then it was a downhill ride after that with the audience.

20:46.087 --> 20:52.618
And the studio became very concerned and said, let's pop in something here that says that this may not be the end.

20:52.778 --> 20:54.481
Yeah, exactly.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.344
So they created a scene.

20:56.780 --> 21:04.010
which was this camera tracking through the foliage and coming to rest on Spock's tube laying there in this leafy glade here.

21:04.731 --> 21:09.097
And the audience said, oh, hello.

21:09.157 --> 21:13.563
Something's in that box, you know, and that's how the resurrection began.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.367
Where is he in your mind now?

21:16.387 --> 21:16.888
Spock?

21:16.908 --> 21:17.068
Yeah.

21:18.109 --> 21:22.716
Well, it's an unsettled issue.

21:22.916 --> 21:26.601
It's an unsettled issue because...

21:27.121 --> 21:48.826
because I did do an appearance as Spock in The Next Generation in a pair of episodes called Reunification, in which Spock was performing ambassadorial duties in the Romulan Empire in the hopes of creating big talk with the Romulans.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.210
And that threat has never been picked up again.

21:52.291 --> 21:56.115
So my assumption is that he's there under deep cover,

21:56.433 --> 22:15.960
uh working with the random people and whether or not that thread will ever be picked up again is i'm dubious about it i don't i don't see it happening but but that's my sense of where where he is physically your feelings about the movies the films as opposed to the television you said you expressed some some

22:16.700 --> 22:45.120
reservations about whether or not this was just some kind of exploiting thing yeah well after star trek two we had a great ride star trek two three and four were all very successful movies and i directed two of them but that's beside the point we had a great ride uh we are you talking commercially or both i think both i think creatively and commercially i think we did some good work bill shatner stumbled on star trek five he had a bad story

22:45.877 --> 22:50.003
I think his directing work was very good, but he had a bad story.

22:50.023 --> 22:52.567
When you're shooting a bad story, there's not much you can do.

22:54.169 --> 22:57.114
Star Trek VI, I think we managed to regain our footing somewhat.

22:57.935 --> 23:02.421
It was not the film that I had hoped it would be, but on the other hand, it was not one of our worst.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.743
It was okay.

23:03.884 --> 23:04.504
It was okay.

23:05.686 --> 23:11.715
It was kind of a potboiler, political thriller.

23:12.117 --> 23:13.760
But I was hoping for something else.

23:13.920 --> 23:20.632
We were dealing with the Klingons, and I was hoping for some really interesting insight into what made the Klingons really sick, and we didn't get that.

23:21.113 --> 23:22.195
We didn't achieve that.

23:22.215 --> 23:28.185
What's your sense of the audience seeing the characters age in our films?

23:28.165 --> 23:32.710
I think they stayed with it.

23:32.950 --> 23:37.795
I think they stayed with it because we were not trying to be physical heroes.

23:37.895 --> 23:40.798
We were trying, we were still doing a professional piece of work.

23:40.898 --> 23:42.619
I think we pulled that off okay.

23:43.600 --> 23:48.265
I was not comfortable watching the Generations movie, Structural 7.

23:48.305 --> 23:49.606
I was not comfortable watching it.

23:49.626 --> 23:52.369
I rejected the role that they offered me in it.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.291
I rejected the

23:54.693 --> 23:55.974
the job of directing it.

23:56.034 --> 23:56.975
I didn't like the script.

23:57.015 --> 23:58.336
I didn't like the movie.

23:58.356 --> 23:59.738
Why is that conceptually?

23:59.758 --> 24:19.496
Well, conceptually, I just thought it was a bad story, but I certainly, watching it, was not comfortable watching William Shatner as Captain Kirk and Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, two guys quite mature, to say the least, in a fist fight with Malcolm McDowell.

24:20.497 --> 24:22.219
I wasn't interested in seeing that at all.

24:23.026 --> 24:23.608
Not at all.

24:24.049 --> 24:25.693
And I went off the audience for it.

24:25.713 --> 24:26.555
It doesn't matter to me.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.663
I wasn't interested.

24:30.586 --> 24:31.929
I wasn't comfortable watching it.

24:31.949 --> 24:33.152
I thought, why are we doing this?

24:33.233 --> 24:34.837
Well, who cares about this fist fight?

24:34.857 --> 24:38.807
Isn't there something more interesting that Star Trek can deliver than a fist fight between these three

24:39.125 --> 24:42.893
At least middle-aged gentleman, you know, I thought it was cheap.

24:42.933 --> 24:43.855
You mentioned Stuart.

24:44.296 --> 24:50.249
I noticed that he took a stage role where he plays a gay friend, I guess.

24:50.269 --> 24:50.790
Yeah, a movie role.

24:50.870 --> 24:51.993
Was it a movie role?

24:52.253 --> 24:53.135
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:53.276 --> 24:57.184
And I guess he mindfully there was trying to...

24:57.603 --> 25:00.971
There are other tricks in my bag.

25:00.991 --> 25:02.173
He makes no bones about it.

25:02.193 --> 25:03.677
He's a very accomplished actor.

25:03.998 --> 25:11.254
I saw him put it in a newspaper article recently saying that he's choosing roles that would get him as far away from Captain Jones-Luc Picard as possible.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.577
Makes no bones about it.

25:12.597 --> 25:13.239
And I understand.

25:13.660 --> 25:14.942
You respect that.

25:14.963 --> 25:16.506
Yeah, sure.

25:16.891 --> 25:25.885
Talk, if you might, a little bit about what is suggested as a sibling rivalry between yourself and Shatner.

25:25.945 --> 25:27.788
We're very close friends these days.

25:28.008 --> 25:29.330
We're very close friends.

25:29.350 --> 25:30.452
We see each other regularly.

25:33.136 --> 25:37.423
We see each other on average of once or twice a month for dinner and what have you.

25:40.187 --> 25:43.032
I admire Bill's energy and his passion.

25:43.052 --> 25:45.295
He has a great passion for life and for work.

25:46.034 --> 25:48.177
and for creativity.

25:49.018 --> 25:51.182
Very, very energetic, passionate guy.

25:53.225 --> 25:54.367
Yes, we had rivalry.

25:57.011 --> 26:03.200
But I have written and said constantly for the last 30 years that his energy was vital to the show.

26:03.761 --> 26:07.066
His physical energy, his emotional energy was vital to the show.

26:07.086 --> 26:11.012
He came to work each day pouring out creative energy.

26:11.192 --> 26:15.298
And that creative energy that he poured out and that style of play that he brought to the show

26:15.700 --> 26:20.568
was vital for my function, because my function was a reacting function.

26:21.229 --> 26:25.716
And if he didn't play what he did, there would be nothing for me as Spock to react to.

26:25.736 --> 26:30.363
When you think about it, of course, the television series is about three years, I think, right?

26:30.383 --> 26:31.685
Yeah.

26:32.426 --> 26:34.630
But the team basically stayed together.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.713
When you think of so many other successful...

26:37.148 --> 26:44.559
television series where one individual will start to develop a degree of celebrity.

26:44.599 --> 26:47.863
Leave the series and they do something to... No, we were right.

26:47.984 --> 26:49.906
No, we hung together pretty tight.

26:49.987 --> 26:53.231
But even beyond the television series into the film series.

26:53.251 --> 26:55.094
Into the films, yes, exactly.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.818
What was your reaction to The Next Generation?

27:00.482 --> 27:06.210
I was very pleasantly surprised at their success.

27:06.848 --> 27:12.015
There was a certain amount of ego involved when it was announced that there would be a next generation show with an entirely new cast.

27:13.096 --> 27:29.879
And some of that ego said to me, is it possible that some other group of actors could find their place in the sun and displace or at the very least share the spotlight with us and maintain without us an audience?

27:29.939 --> 27:30.780
And they certainly did.

27:31.351 --> 27:32.012
They certainly did.

27:32.032 --> 27:33.734
They were extremely successful.

27:33.754 --> 27:38.661
Did they have a platform from which to take off that we had established, the platform that we had established?

27:38.681 --> 27:38.841
Yes.

27:39.342 --> 27:42.166
But nevertheless, they called out their own identity and did it very well.

27:42.306 --> 27:47.834
I think the Smithsonian, doesn't the Smithsonian have an enterprise?

27:48.374 --> 27:50.938
They have had a Star Trek display there for many, many years.

27:50.958 --> 27:53.121
Okay, so you're talking about a cultural artifact.

27:53.141 --> 27:53.622
Yeah.

27:53.642 --> 27:55.464
And a cultural impact.

27:55.785 --> 27:57.126
Yeah.

27:57.227 --> 28:01.172
I'm still awed by the fact that we are in a culture as deep as we are.

28:01.709 --> 28:13.913
Most any day of the week you can pick up newspapers and see references to Where No Man Has Gone Before, The Final Frontier, Be Me Up Scotty, Live Long and Prosper.

28:14.197 --> 28:19.142
all of those references to Star Trek are in the language and in the culture.

28:19.302 --> 28:25.028
I know it's in the book, but talk to me about your invention of that.

28:25.048 --> 28:27.751
Well, it was a serendipitous moment.

28:28.451 --> 28:39.883
I'm an actor who, I taught acting classes, and I taught actors that if you are, the character that the author has written,

28:41.585 --> 29:04.285
It has been said is stuck with the actor who portrays him and the character Hopefully looks forward to the actor to bring some life and some and some texture and some dimensionality to this portrayal so the actor must arrive each day with some

29:04.619 --> 29:07.322
some gift to this character.

29:08.284 --> 29:11.648
You cannot simply arrive and read the words that are on the page.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.029
You've got to find more than that.

29:13.050 --> 29:15.292
You've got to flesh this character out.

29:15.312 --> 29:26.286
On that day, when we were about to shoot this sequence, I was on my game and I'm saying to myself, look, we are going to Vulcan for the first time.

29:26.727 --> 29:28.669
We're going to see other Vulcans for the first time.

29:28.689 --> 29:30.651
This is an important day for Spock.

29:30.672 --> 29:33.495
This is an important day for the character and an important day for Star Trek.

29:34.201 --> 29:40.327
And I was thrilled when I saw the casting of this lady, Sue Wielowski, playing Chapau.

29:40.728 --> 29:48.075
And the director at stage was this wonderfully interesting ritualistic ceremonial arrival of the wedding party.

29:48.515 --> 29:50.437
And they carried her in on a sedan chair.

29:50.758 --> 29:56.103
And there's this guy shaking this tambourine thing, you know, with a lot of ritual and a lot of interesting sounds going on.

29:56.123 --> 29:57.765
And I thought, this is good.

29:57.785 --> 29:58.545
This is good.

29:58.565 --> 30:00.107
It was a wonderful script.

30:01.235 --> 30:03.658
I'm fine, thank you.

30:03.999 --> 30:08.565
It was a wonderful script which pleased me knowing, a script by Theodore Sturgeon.

30:08.826 --> 30:12.150
Very intelligent, very tasteful, poetic script.

30:13.192 --> 30:19.260
And I thought, let's look for opportunities here to develop this Vulcan culture.

30:20.877 --> 30:27.047
And I said, as I looked, I said to the director, wouldn't it be wonderful if we had some special thing that Vulcans do when they greet?

30:27.147 --> 30:30.713
Humans shake hands or military people salute each other.

30:30.753 --> 30:33.056
Asians bow to each other.

30:33.116 --> 30:35.360
Eskimos rub noses of what they do.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.885
Indians have some kind of a hand gesture.

30:40.508 --> 30:41.770
What do Vulcans do?

30:43.012 --> 30:48.100
And then I've come up with this idea that came from my childhood.

30:48.400 --> 30:54.846
from that magic moment in the synagogue when the Kohanim blessed the congregation.

30:54.866 --> 31:06.718
The blessing is from the Old and New Testament, may the Lord bless you and keep you, may the Lord have his countenance to shine upon you, may the Lord turn his face unto you and grant you peace, and so forth.

31:06.738 --> 31:12.704
But I remembered this very exciting, dramatic event in the synagogue.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.568
And it was dramatic, I learned much later,

31:16.919 --> 31:24.710
The drama is created, the drama came from the fact that the whole congregation bows their head and looks away and does not look at these gentlemen.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.355
I peeked because I was so curious and I saw them doing this.

31:30.458 --> 31:46.740
And the congregation does that because when they are doing that prayer and doing that incantation of that prayer, and the way they did it was a keening, wailing kind of sound, they are invoking God's presence.

31:47.648 --> 31:52.357
And the essence of God is said to enter the sanctuary during that prayer.

31:52.757 --> 31:57.386
And man, humankind, must not see the essence of God.

31:57.406 --> 31:58.768
It's too awesome and too powerful.

31:58.788 --> 32:01.433
You could die if you saw this.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.676
It's heavy stuff.

32:02.696 --> 32:05.601
Yeah, heavy stuff, exactly.

32:06.302 --> 32:08.847
And I sensed that magic as a kid.

32:09.348 --> 32:11.091
It was a great theatricality of that.

32:12.083 --> 32:15.552
And I became fascinated with this gesture.

32:15.933 --> 32:16.675
So I learned it.

32:16.856 --> 32:21.167
And it seemed interesting and useful on this day.

32:21.387 --> 32:22.350
Was it improvised?

32:22.470 --> 32:28.827
I guess the question does go to whether or not there was improvisation.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.399
as the jazz people say, and the characters?

32:31.960 --> 32:35.683
No, it wasn't spontaneous, and it wasn't something that I just did during the scene.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.806
No, it was discussed and prepared, but minimally.

32:38.886 --> 32:42.409
I said to the director, I'd like to do something here, and he said, what do you have in mind?

32:42.429 --> 32:43.290
And I said, how about this?

32:43.350 --> 32:43.970
And he said, okay.

32:44.191 --> 32:45.712
Is there a trick to doing it, by the way?

32:47.373 --> 32:50.456
Years of diligent practice.

32:50.476 --> 32:54.140
If I were to put it in the story, how it's done, what would you say?

32:54.400 --> 32:55.100
How is it done?

32:55.481 --> 32:56.822
How do you do the...

32:57.376 --> 33:00.920
Well, I have a certain amount of dexterity, I guess.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.904
Not everybody can do that, but I'm not sure.

33:03.924 --> 33:06.687
It's a spread of the fingers.

33:06.707 --> 33:13.435
The thumb is outstretched to one side, to right or left, depending on which hand we're talking about.

33:13.455 --> 33:21.325
In this case, it's the right hand, so the thumb is outspread towards my left, and then the next two fingers, and then a space, and then the final two fingers.

33:22.026 --> 33:25.510
So you have a three-pronged sort of pitchfork look.

33:26.030 --> 33:28.713
And there's another explanation for this.

33:28.733 --> 33:37.202
This is the shape, this three-pronged look is the shape of the letter Shin in the Hebrew alphabet.

33:37.222 --> 33:43.789
The letter Shin is the first letter in the word Shaddai, Hebrew word Shaddai.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.851
Shaddai is the name of the Almighty.

33:47.173 --> 33:52.999
So there's this legend that the Kohanim are using

33:53.553 --> 34:00.198
a symbol of the Almighty's name when they bless the congregation.

34:00.218 --> 34:02.888
There's also tabulistic references to this shape.

34:03.273 --> 34:08.680
numerological Kabbalistic references which are very mysterious and I don't know a lot about.

34:08.700 --> 34:10.422
So there's no trick to it.

34:10.442 --> 34:12.986
It's just something that... It's an acquired talent.

34:13.226 --> 34:19.714
If you put that thumb out, how do you bring that... It's an acquired talent.

34:19.854 --> 34:22.678
Years of diligent practice and I've learned to do that.

34:22.698 --> 34:23.759
We've got about 15 minutes.

34:24.280 --> 34:28.065
Tell me about, it must have been a special role working with your son,

34:28.518 --> 34:29.499
It was.

34:29.739 --> 34:30.200
It was.

34:30.520 --> 34:35.606
My son has gone through a difficult process.

34:35.746 --> 34:42.253
For a long time, he was working very hard at doing anything that I did not do.

34:43.454 --> 34:44.255
Understandably.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.056
Yes, of course.

34:45.376 --> 34:48.940
Trying desperately to identify himself separately from me.

34:49.741 --> 34:56.128
And he chose the law as a path to accomplish that.

34:56.547 --> 34:58.350
because I had nothing to do with the law.

34:59.371 --> 35:09.025
He never was really attracted to it, never was in love with it, and was always troubled by what he discovered when practicing it.

35:09.046 --> 35:19.421
And that was that he simply didn't like what he had to do, which was, he found it rather venal, he found it rather undignified and unpleasant.

35:19.501 --> 35:23.567
The work was on maybe doing contract law in our business,

35:23.969 --> 35:27.173
particularly in the music business, and he just didn't like it.

35:27.213 --> 35:29.836
He didn't like himself, and he didn't like the people he was working with.

35:30.797 --> 35:41.088
And gradually, unbeknownst to me, he started taking classes in writing, directing, and acting.

35:41.108 --> 35:46.474
I think he wanted to test the order before he made some announcement to me, Dad, I'm going to do this.

35:46.494 --> 35:51.900
I think he wanted to find out for himself who he was in that territory.

35:52.471 --> 36:02.393
And gradually, finding that he was having, that he was finding some joy in his life, he began to reveal to me that he was doing this, and he began to extricate himself from a law career.

36:03.235 --> 36:07.866
And I introduced him to visiting sets.

36:07.986 --> 36:10.632
I had him on Star Trek VI, of which I was producing.

36:11.320 --> 36:18.887
I had him on Star Trek 6 in the lowliest of jobs, running errands and being what is known in our business as a gopher.

36:18.907 --> 36:20.148
Go for this and go for that.

36:21.449 --> 36:25.613
First at no salary and then at a minimal, a few hundred bucks a week.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.514
Minimal salary.

36:27.535 --> 36:28.155
He did that.

36:28.235 --> 36:30.757
Then he did at no salary.

36:30.817 --> 36:39.285
Spent a lot of time on the next generation set, studying the process, learning the process, paying his dues, accumulating information.

36:39.620 --> 36:44.627
And after several months or close to a year, they gave him his first directing assignment.

36:44.647 --> 36:46.190
And then they gave him a second one.

36:46.210 --> 36:47.532
And then they sent him out on his own.

36:48.593 --> 36:50.756
And he went out and made a short film.

36:52.098 --> 36:53.901
He struggled.

36:53.921 --> 37:04.396
He put it together with little or no money, looking for a lot of favors, wrote and directed a 25-minute film, learned still more about what goes into the process.

37:04.456 --> 37:08.462
And then finally, one day, we were having this conversation about

37:09.016 --> 37:13.605
his efforts, and we talked about the fact that Outer Limits was now on the air again.

37:13.625 --> 37:18.235
It was a series that had been on the air in the 50s, 60s.

37:19.217 --> 37:29.438
And I had worked in it in an episode called I, Robot, a short story, a classic science fiction short story about a robot that's put on top of a murder.

37:30.042 --> 37:34.689
And I said, why don't we suggest to Showtime that we'll do this together.

37:34.709 --> 37:35.851
You direct and I'll act in it.

37:36.131 --> 37:36.772
And he did.

37:36.833 --> 37:41.820
He carried the ball and went to them and presented the idea, pursued it with them, and eventually we did it.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.464
There was trepidation for me.

37:45.005 --> 37:52.016
Going to Canada, which is where we were shooting things in Vancouver, I thought to myself, if he's not on his game, I'm in trouble here.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.480
I'm in trouble as an actor and I'm in trouble as a father.

37:55.102 --> 38:00.178
I hope that we won't come to a moment or a day where he turns to me and says, I don't know what I'm doing.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.225
What should I do here or there?

38:02.767 --> 38:04.352
It never happened, on the contrary.

38:04.889 --> 38:09.797
He was absolutely a top-notch professional.

38:09.817 --> 38:11.780
It was very exciting to see him work.

38:11.961 --> 38:12.842
Oh, it was great.

38:13.043 --> 38:13.563
It was great.

38:13.623 --> 38:20.054
And to see everybody else responding to his direction because he was definitely there in every respect.

38:20.415 --> 38:21.757
His craftsmanship was there.

38:22.218 --> 38:29.810
His sense of the interior life of the piece was there in great force.

38:29.830 --> 38:30.812
He was wonderful.

38:31.197 --> 38:36.443
And I was able to relax and enjoy myself as an actor and just watch this good director doing his job.

38:36.964 --> 38:39.967
And since then, he has had a flurry of activity.

38:41.128 --> 38:44.652
He directed an episode of Babylon 5.

38:45.133 --> 38:48.397
He's just been asked to do three more in the coming months.

38:48.437 --> 38:57.627
He is now prepping and he starts shooting, I think, next Monday or Tuesday on NYPD Blue, which is a very prestigious assignment for him.

38:58.113 --> 39:04.749
And he has an episode of another TV show called, I think it's called Sliders, a new series that I'm not familiar with.

39:04.769 --> 39:07.195
He's coming, he goes to work on that in February.

39:07.677 --> 39:10.082
So he has his calendar filling up with work.

39:10.343 --> 39:11.305
He's a great show.

39:12.087 --> 39:12.990
He's a great show.

39:13.190 --> 39:16.037
And what's on your plate for the future?

39:16.557 --> 39:25.227
Well, for a guy who considers himself pretty much having done the job, I find myself more busy than I want to be.

39:25.407 --> 39:35.018
I'm right now co-executive producing a television series that's on the air currently called Deadly Games, doing marginally well.

39:35.118 --> 39:36.119
I wish it were doing better.

39:37.741 --> 39:40.965
It's on the United Paramount Network, which is a tough place to be.

39:41.045 --> 39:46.311
It's a strange kind of almost network, really.

39:46.898 --> 39:48.199
So I'm doing that.

39:49.120 --> 39:53.025
I'm working on a novel, my first science fiction novel.

39:53.165 --> 39:58.330
I think I have an exciting idea for a central character that I want to pursue.

39:58.370 --> 40:03.756
And I have a comic book, which I'm delighted with.

40:03.856 --> 40:04.937
It's called Primordials.

40:05.638 --> 40:07.120
It's been on the stand for about a year.

40:07.180 --> 40:11.584
And one of the books has just picked it up to do a hardcover novel version of it next year.

40:12.185 --> 40:13.466
Yeah, so it goes on.

40:13.547 --> 40:14.948
It goes on.

40:15.451 --> 40:17.698
There is life after spark.

40:17.778 --> 40:18.079
Yeah.

40:19.102 --> 40:26.305
I compare myself to a cruise ship that's been cruising along out in the ocean for a number of years.

40:26.808 --> 40:31.015
Even when you pull the throttle back to full stop, it doesn't stop.

40:31.095 --> 40:34.440
It has some momentum.

40:34.480 --> 40:40.209
It keeps going for a while, and that's the way I feel.

40:40.289 --> 40:48.322
I'm not trying to create projects for myself, but there is momentum as a result of all the years of work, I guess.

40:48.342 --> 40:48.602
That's great.

40:48.622 --> 40:49.744
Do you know Bill Self?

40:50.180 --> 40:51.662
I know the name.

40:51.963 --> 40:54.627
He was head of one of the studios for a while.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.049
Yeah, yeah, he's in my book.

40:56.089 --> 40:58.653
That's why I always spend some time out there.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.255
I don't know him personally.

41:00.275 --> 41:03.260
I did a book on bibliomania, the book of madness.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.021
So it's pretty good.

41:04.041 --> 41:07.246
It's in its third printing.

41:07.787 --> 41:08.708
Yeah, great.

41:08.809 --> 41:13.516
If you'd like, if you give me the address of your office or something, I'll be happy to send you this.

41:13.536 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, please, please.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.682
501 South Beverly Drive.

41:17.722 --> 41:18.904
Okay.

41:19.036 --> 41:20.698
Beverly Hills, California.

41:20.718 --> 41:22.581
90212.

41:22.601 --> 41:24.504
90212.

41:24.885 --> 41:27.509
Do you know Louise Taper?

41:27.909 --> 41:29.952
The Taper's in Beverly Hills?

41:29.972 --> 41:30.192
No.

41:30.373 --> 41:31.835
She's the big Lincoln collector.

41:31.855 --> 41:34.980
She had a huge exhibition at the Lincoln Library.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.104
See, she's in California.

41:38.525 --> 41:42.070
Maybe I'll send you a copy of the book if you're interested in doing that.

41:42.090 --> 41:42.771
Great.

41:43.172 --> 41:43.893
I'd love to see it.

41:43.933 --> 41:45.335
Well, we have to wrap it up.

41:45.355 --> 41:47.198
I'll have you to describe a couple of books for me.

41:47.538 --> 41:48.840
Would you kindly do that?
