WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:06.245
But it wasn't in another quarter.

00:06.265 --> 00:07.827
I thought, that's funny.

00:07.847 --> 00:15.319
I thought, well, it's funny.

00:15.339 --> 00:20.486
He left it out.

00:20.506 --> 00:21.588
I wonder why he left it out.

00:21.608 --> 00:26.976
And when I was reading it, it said, against death and all oblivious enmity.

00:27.297 --> 00:30.662
He thought, live in, as a syllable on the same root.

00:30.997 --> 00:36.622
but it was inserted into a bigger word, so that's why I hadn't seen it first, but I was laughing.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.863
He does funny things like that.

00:38.304 --> 00:39.625
Well, you're talking about it.

00:39.645 --> 00:43.048
You're doing so many of these poems.

00:43.068 --> 00:47.892
Do you mindfully memorize them, or is it just... No, I don't know them all.

00:48.092 --> 00:49.354
I mean, I know pieces of it.

00:49.874 --> 00:50.735
Oh, I know the title.

00:50.895 --> 00:58.742
Oh, I know how I remember the... I couldn't have recited to you the first gloss, for instance, but it's there in my mind, and every baddest little gesture is there.

00:59.026 --> 01:25.607
so they're they're lodged in different ways some of them are lodged completely some of them are lodged in parts i'm only by the title i couldn't find the title i forgot the title lions in sweden for you so i had to go looking for the poem itself because i knew the vegetation still abounds with forms and stuff like that and i knew the fourth true authentic race was there um and then just i'll just one other thing and by the way i offer this if you'd like

01:26.633 --> 01:29.580
I'm more than happy to show you the quotes of yours I use.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.869
Sure, just sometimes because one is sloppy sometimes.

01:32.989 --> 01:36.417
I'm very happy to get it right.

01:36.498 --> 01:38.623
I have no problems.

01:39.084 --> 01:41.470
I do this at my carol sometimes.

01:42.243 --> 01:44.105
You have to use that.

01:44.225 --> 01:47.470
I've seen nothing in this conversation with you giving my applause.

01:47.490 --> 01:56.701
No, but even so, when the first call did the interview over the telephone, and then they sent it to me, and some of the sentences were redundant and sloppy, and I would scream them up again.

01:56.761 --> 01:58.463
I'd like to do that.

01:58.624 --> 01:59.585
Sure, I'd love that.

02:00.326 --> 02:08.436
And just one other thing, if you could just give me a little quote of yours, the poem can be a companion through life.

02:08.770 --> 02:15.756
And if you could just give me a little bit of a riff on that, if you don't mind.

02:15.776 --> 02:15.876
Sure.

02:16.957 --> 02:20.580
Well, I spent a lot of time winning poems by heart in my youth.

02:21.521 --> 02:26.746
And I learned 15 or 16 Shakespeare's sonnets when I was maybe 15.

02:26.826 --> 02:28.527
I learned most of all things.

02:28.547 --> 02:33.251
I learned various things of Wordsworth, lots of Dylan Thomas at the time.

02:33.371 --> 02:37.495
This was all 15, 16, 17 while I was in high school, once I woke up to

02:38.048 --> 02:39.951
the fact that poetry was about adult life.

02:40.172 --> 02:45.601
I also loved the psalms because they were dangerous poems.

02:45.621 --> 02:49.107
They were the first dangerous poems I knew that responded.

02:49.367 --> 02:53.875
I did an interview in a book called Communion about, you're supposed to tell a book of the Bible.

02:55.057 --> 02:59.905
It influenced you, and I wrote an essay on psalms saying we were the only wild

03:00.374 --> 03:06.139
poetry I knew about, you know, I shall break their children's heads on those terrific stuff.

03:06.520 --> 03:13.627
And I was so wild inside myself as an adolescent that I didn't have anything mirroring that back to me except the sound.

03:13.647 --> 03:21.274
So it was how I learned about emotional life and through poetry.

03:21.414 --> 03:25.898
And if you don't memorize it, you don't have it to take around with you on street cars and so forth.

03:25.918 --> 03:28.761
So since I was stuck hanging back and forth to school,

03:29.095 --> 03:33.561
I needed something to do with my head, and so I would say these poems over to myself.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.208
And I find you possess them very differently when you know them by heart.

03:39.310 --> 03:41.833
So even dangerous poems can be companions through life?

03:42.074 --> 03:42.574
Oh, yeah.

03:42.795 --> 03:55.833
I think, you know, I remember memorizing Hopkins was also dangerous when he says, and I don't know if you know his poem, it's called Carrie and Humphrey, and he wants to be at suicide.

03:55.853 --> 03:59.018
He raises himself against committing suicide and says,

03:59.369 --> 04:04.355
I will not carry in comfort despair, not feast on thee.

04:05.517 --> 04:11.124
Mat and twist, slack they may be, these last strands of man in me.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.109
And so it's, you know, a spell against despair.

04:15.209 --> 04:18.012
How is it dangerous for you, though?

04:18.092 --> 04:24.280
Well, suicide was considered wrong in the upbringing I had.

04:24.749 --> 04:31.778
And so somebody flirting, you might say, whether it was Sylvia Plath, laser, and sex, and so forth, then it was Hopkins.

04:31.798 --> 04:36.705
Somebody flirting with the idea of suicide, which was very agreeable to me at the time.

04:36.725 --> 04:39.789
He was very attractive to me at the time, the idea of suicide.

04:39.809 --> 04:52.225
So somebody coming to that brink and writing about it, or, my own hand, let me more have pity on, let me live to my sad self, be laughter, kind, charitable, not live

04:52.458 --> 04:57.344
this tormented mind with this tormented mind, tormenting, yes.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.546
You know, it's Hopkins, you know.

04:59.147 --> 05:00.849
I don't know how to let me more have opinion on it.

05:00.869 --> 05:07.337
So the tormented mind, tormenting the tormented mind, was something I knew about that I'd never seen said.

05:08.939 --> 05:10.841
And some of it you respected.

05:10.861 --> 05:12.163
By anybody.

05:12.183 --> 05:14.066
It resonated with you in a way.

05:14.086 --> 05:16.128
Well, yes, it matched my feelings.

05:16.148 --> 05:22.296
And so... But in a poetic way, would it have had the same impact if it was something like your written poems?

05:24.503 --> 05:26.867
Nothing made much of an impact on me.

05:27.688 --> 05:34.298
I like non-fiction posts very much, especially a kind of explaining something to me that I don't like scientific.

05:34.719 --> 05:37.463
That's, you know, popularizing science.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.466
And I like biography, if it's short.

05:39.486 --> 05:42.911
I hate to make facts dumps.

05:44.874 --> 05:46.617
But I like a well-written biography.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.521
I need somebody like Wendell Gordon-Rawkes.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.165
That's fine.

05:54.052 --> 06:04.765
The direct transfusion of emotion from one person to another only seemed to me in my youth to happen in music and poetry.

06:04.785 --> 06:22.507
Novels were too diffuse and worldly and often comic or ironic, and I wanted the straight heroine of emotion intravenously transfused, and music did it very much for me, and so did poetry.

06:22.527 --> 06:23.468
And music continues.

06:23.937 --> 06:24.337
Yes.

06:24.818 --> 06:31.446
And so, could you name some of the companions, the poetic companions, that have the confidence in you of your life?

06:31.807 --> 06:34.730
Well, all your poets do once you acquire them.

06:34.750 --> 06:40.897
I mean, the first poet I seriously acquired was Shakespeare, the second one was Keats, but not Shakespeare's plays.

06:41.578 --> 06:46.124
I mean, just the lyrics, just the song, not Venus, or Dallas, of course.

06:47.365 --> 06:52.932
But there was Shakespeare, there was Keats, then there was Dylan Thomas when I was 15.

06:53.468 --> 06:56.291
And then there was Hopkins also when I was 16.

06:57.453 --> 07:00.196
And then there was Gates.

07:00.557 --> 07:01.598
He was the next big one.

07:02.499 --> 07:04.321
And then there were the ones I've written.

07:04.381 --> 07:07.766
I came across George Herbert quite early.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.187
I don't quite remember how.

07:10.109 --> 07:10.930
But he was one of them.

07:10.950 --> 07:14.894
And I wanted to write my second book on Herbert, but I realized I didn't know enough about the Renaissance.

07:15.675 --> 07:16.677
So I had to postpone it.

07:16.737 --> 07:21.062
And I wrote my second book on Wallace Stevens, who was the next poet that I was enamored of.

07:21.886 --> 07:23.868
And then it was Herbert.

07:24.449 --> 07:30.416
And then I went back to Shakespeare and so on, and, um... See, everyone in your name has been a giant.

07:31.557 --> 07:38.926
Was there any poets that made an impression on you early in life when you've gone back up and said, I can't see why they're so excited?

07:38.946 --> 07:42.691
I mean, we came... I mean, like Thomas Wolfe, you know, I read him as a kid.

07:42.711 --> 07:44.753
I was thinking he was fabulous.

07:44.813 --> 07:45.514
And then reading him,

07:46.085 --> 07:49.689
As I got older, I can't, you know, you have to be young.

07:49.769 --> 07:50.930
I did like to be young.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.111
But some of them last.

07:52.191 --> 07:53.353
I mean, like, husband lasts.

07:53.493 --> 07:57.537
You go back to him when he's very tough, as well as being very wistful.

07:57.937 --> 08:00.600
But everything is that Millet didn't hold up, for instance.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.562
I think she was the only one, probably.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.943
Did you enjoy Longfellow when you were young?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.906
Well, I still enjoy Longfellow.

08:05.926 --> 08:08.208
But it's so dated for you.

08:08.228 --> 08:09.009
The lyrics aren't.

08:09.209 --> 08:14.134
I mean, maybe some of them are, but my mother used to recite it once, the Schooner, Hesperus, etc.,

08:14.452 --> 08:19.278
But I don't know if you've ever read Longfellow's exquisite poem called The Aftermath.

08:21.120 --> 08:34.756
The Aftermath, the second harvest, after you've taken the first harvest, obviously, of life, and then you go back scrabbling around on the ground to see if you can find anything else possibly to nourish you.

08:35.497 --> 08:36.277
It's a beautiful one.

08:36.297 --> 08:38.560
But he was a superstar in his days.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.402
Well, partly because he was so learned.

08:40.422 --> 08:42.805
I mean, he was a professor at Harvard.

08:43.274 --> 08:50.082
I have a first picture of his translation of Dante, which is really fun, because he really tried to do it.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.324
Follow the, yeah.

08:51.965 --> 08:57.912
And he was a, he had an exquisite gift for rhythm and cadence.

08:58.293 --> 09:02.218
Do you know the Hebrew, the Jewish cemetery at Newport long ago?

09:02.238 --> 09:02.358
No.

09:03.059 --> 09:05.622
Oh, that's a great, great poem.

09:05.842 --> 09:09.687
Down where the Turo Synagogue is, you know, near there, there's a Jewish cemetery.

09:10.148 --> 09:12.150
And he goes and looks at the Jewish cemetery.

09:12.738 --> 09:33.008
and talks about the long mysterious exodus of death, and talks about the ghettoizing of the Jews and the infliction of such hatred on them.

09:42.488 --> 09:51.601
And he looks at the unintelligible writing on the grave and that he can't read.

10:05.781 --> 10:12.090
It's called the Jewish, the Jewish cemetery at Newport.

10:12.610 --> 10:17.137
And it is still there to be seen along with the tour from the group.

10:17.958 --> 10:26.730
You know, we were talking earlier about Dickinson, the totally unknown in her lifetime.

10:26.751 --> 10:26.891
Mm-hmm.

10:27.732 --> 10:30.516
And at the same time, I often got to write a little less about this.

10:30.536 --> 10:30.736
Yes.

10:31.017 --> 10:33.520
Celia Faxter, almost an exact contemporary.

10:34.522 --> 10:35.022
Celia Faxter.

10:35.043 --> 10:36.425
Celia Faxter, yes.

10:36.445 --> 10:36.905
Totally.

10:36.985 --> 10:39.529
I mean, if you didn't do the island guiding with child has him,

10:39.830 --> 10:42.034
You wouldn't even know who she is today.

10:42.054 --> 10:45.219
And you read, some of her poems are delightful.

10:45.639 --> 10:46.180
They're fun.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.527
And she had these salons.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.631
She lived in an island.

10:53.552 --> 11:00.363
I thought, you know, here she's out on the island, up there.

11:00.383 --> 11:03.388
And they almost, didn't they all intersect with Higginson, I think?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.972
I think so, yes.

11:06.408 --> 11:10.414
And I just met one of her descendants when I gave a talk to Chicago to the Highlands alumni.

11:10.434 --> 11:17.504
He came up and told me that he was a descendant of Celia Baxter, and he was so very proud.

11:18.506 --> 11:20.809
She was quite a woman.

11:20.969 --> 11:23.934
Let me just do the Jewish cemetery at Newport for you.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.397
It would be amazing.

11:26.478 --> 11:35.571
I'm sorry the aftermath is in here, but it will be in the Hollander, I'm sure it's in the Hollander, two volumes, 19th century.

11:36.175 --> 11:40.241
So you still have a great deal of admiration for Longfellow.

11:40.341 --> 11:40.942
Oh, yes.

11:41.223 --> 11:43.687
I think he was the most ultimate person in America.

11:43.827 --> 11:46.972
Probably one of the very best-reads of his time.

11:46.992 --> 12:03.617
And he was the one with the least provincial, because he was Spanish-rich and Italian, and came away to the mall and had traveled to Europe, and so he didn't have that position of the foreign.

12:04.660 --> 12:19.453
of our Boston circles in which we move, and a people of any description of the crime, especially of the foreign Catholic dimension, and he was more prejudiced.

12:19.473 --> 12:29.842
In that way, he was prepared, as was now built, to appreciate fully the dimensions of European culture and didn't feel defensive about it.

12:30.663 --> 12:32.845
In spite of the fact of being very American,

12:33.888 --> 12:46.509
in himself, um, and writing his American writing poems like Ty Walker.

12:46.529 --> 12:49.254
No, I haven't asked you at all about the Jefferson lecture because I have it.

12:50.155 --> 12:50.295
Uh-huh.

12:50.315 --> 12:59.811
And, uh, but it is kind of interesting where you are calling for an expansion beyond the text for the, uh, the entire, uh,

13:03.132 --> 13:14.426
Well, just to say, you ought to pose the commandments you take as the central objects of study, not the texts of historians or philosophers, but the products of aesthetic endeavor.

13:14.506 --> 13:17.970
And then, by the arts, the cultures are principally revered.

13:17.990 --> 13:21.454
And for a literary critic... Well, it includes the arts.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.116
I mean, literature is one of the arts.

13:23.196 --> 13:27.081
Obviously, but it's everything that you're saying.

13:27.297 --> 13:30.881
Is this a departure for you, or is this going to more or less reflect?

13:30.901 --> 13:50.942
Well, I just always felt that art was more about the main arts, and the subsidiary wants to, more or more interesting than either history, as it was presented to me in school, very boringly, and or philosophy, which also came as kind of pre-digested ideas.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.980
It wasn't that you were working out an idea for yourself.

13:54.020 --> 13:57.924
You're told, this is what so-and-so thought, and this is what Nietzsche thought.

13:57.944 --> 14:04.092
And that's... I mean, they were working out their own particular systems, and that's fine.

14:04.712 --> 14:07.536
But they weren't working the modern language for fields, to me.

14:08.357 --> 14:10.579
And they didn't have the unity of works of art.

14:10.679 --> 14:14.884
I mean, that's a beautiful whole thing that I like, the everything I really like.

14:14.944 --> 14:17.487
So that philosophers don't have that, and historians don't have it.

14:18.328 --> 14:21.452
And it's not moving in the same way that art is moving.

14:21.820 --> 14:27.827
It doesn't have, it's not constructed around the emotions so much as around a kind of exposition.

14:28.688 --> 14:33.734
And so anyway, I think if they taught students the ice, everything else would fall.

14:33.794 --> 14:34.715
Everything would fall into play.

14:34.735 --> 14:35.576
Everything would fall into play.

14:35.596 --> 14:41.743
And then there was another quote, which I love, and it's from the symposium of poetry criticism from May 2000.

14:41.803 --> 14:42.664
Yeah.

14:42.684 --> 14:45.047
Anyway, here's a quote.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.891
I would like to come back to the question of poetry and cultural context.

14:49.310 --> 14:52.734
I don't myself think that I have ever connected with context in any way.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.436
It's kind of what you're saying.

14:54.456 --> 14:55.918
You like the beautiful things.

14:55.938 --> 14:56.759
I was at Bookworm.

14:56.779 --> 14:57.740
I was in the library.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.621
I was in my bedroom.

14:58.681 --> 14:59.582
I was in my study.

15:00.063 --> 15:01.064
I'm not interested in groups.

15:01.104 --> 15:02.565
I've never joined a political party.

15:02.585 --> 15:03.386
I've never voted.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.187
Is that true?

15:05.188 --> 15:07.311
Never registered to vote.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.773
I've never registered to vote.

15:09.093 --> 15:10.114
I've never gone to church.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.956
I've never belonged to a club.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.458
I've never belonged to anything.

15:13.598 --> 15:16.802
So context are, for me, in some ways, deeply spectral.

15:17.255 --> 15:23.604
They don't seem to exist, and that is the deficiency of the kind of criticism I do is probably its virtue as well.

15:23.904 --> 15:26.107
We all know the defects of my virtue.

15:26.127 --> 15:27.609
It's marvelous.

15:27.629 --> 15:28.110
That's true.

15:28.130 --> 15:29.151
I just know it.

15:29.171 --> 15:31.374
Self-examination.

15:31.554 --> 15:31.855
I am a bummer.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.257
I mean, I can't help it.

15:33.277 --> 15:39.826
But in lieu of all these things that you don't do is the art, I guess, that does give you everything.

15:40.086 --> 15:40.486
It's terrific.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.469
It's a wonderful, completed thing that you were just saying.

15:42.489 --> 15:46.114
And the people I like are very widely staffed.

15:46.499 --> 15:51.646
I mean, I remember at one point a shrink saying, well, do you have friends?

15:51.906 --> 15:53.749
And I said, well, yes.

15:54.570 --> 16:00.999
But one is in London, one is in Utah, one in... And that's the case.

16:01.119 --> 16:06.046
So you don't have a... I mean, there aren't any clubs of people who like beautiful whole things.

16:06.707 --> 16:13.836
So... Nice sprays in our beautiful whole things.

16:13.856 --> 16:14.397
Take all these things down.

16:15.102 --> 16:20.029
Okay, well, you know, I don't really give him very generously for your time.

16:20.149 --> 16:21.030
I don't want to.

16:21.050 --> 16:27.299
Well, I know you're going to write his poem, but I feel very happy.

16:27.379 --> 16:32.806
What I would like to do is let me transcribe this right up, what I'd like to do.

16:33.046 --> 16:38.374
And if you'd like, I'd be more than happy to send it off to you.

16:38.494 --> 16:38.694
Okay.

16:38.714 --> 16:40.857
And if you think I...

16:41.326 --> 16:42.448
I'm sorry.

16:43.709 --> 16:44.250
Let me know.

16:44.370 --> 16:49.718
No, but I'm sorry that I can't be more positive about the impact.

16:50.098 --> 16:54.023
I know you want to pursue that, but it feeds into the big screen.

16:54.384 --> 16:58.910
I mean, Beethoven feeds him and... Oh, but was Beethoven a reader, do you think?

16:59.691 --> 17:01.434
No, I just mean in the state of culture.

17:01.454 --> 17:09.004
I know that I'm picking up on things that you're saying, but... Certainly Beethoven had read Jennifer, and...

17:09.743 --> 17:11.225
I don't know Beethoven's life enough.

17:11.425 --> 17:13.507
I'm sure a name of Solomon's life itself also.

17:14.168 --> 17:15.009
I don't know his letters.

17:15.490 --> 17:30.728
But all I mean is, if you think of romanticism, things are feeding in from painting, things are feeding in from music, things are feeding in from literature, things are feeding in from the fact that the Grand Tour becomes possible and people go around to the Alps.

17:31.008 --> 17:36.915
And so that there are so many convergences that all we know is that something happens.

17:37.874 --> 17:39.836
But we can't give it a name.

17:40.657 --> 17:42.459
We can't give it a source.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.565
I have some excellent pictures here, by the way.

17:47.585 --> 17:48.826
This is from the digital.

17:48.866 --> 17:55.614
I never thought I would succumb, but I did.

17:55.634 --> 17:56.115
You can see the picture.

17:56.135 --> 18:00.059
Oh, yeah.

18:00.079 --> 18:00.920
Well, I'm going to work.

18:01.601 --> 18:02.342
Thank you very much.

18:02.422 --> 18:05.265
Thank you for driving in from North Grafton and all of us.

18:06.224 --> 18:11.131
Yesterday I had unbelievable rain.

18:11.391 --> 18:24.409
Not only did I have bad rain, there was a camper that had caught fire on the Mass Pike, which I heard about on the radio fine, so I got off at Route 30 and decided to go through and made it, and I just got it to the teeth of the storm, which was... That was wild.

18:24.829 --> 18:26.211
It was hellish.

18:26.332 --> 18:33.261
It was very simple.

18:34.203 --> 19:00.902
It's a great interest of mine, I suppose.

19:01.085 --> 19:11.999
And I have collaborated on several of them with the Arian Press in San Francisco.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.141
I gave a lecture out there.

19:13.542 --> 19:13.802
That's right.

19:13.822 --> 19:14.703
It was on your website.

19:14.743 --> 19:17.587
We have a lovely turnout.

19:17.607 --> 19:18.929
Yeah, he's a terrific person.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.671
And I've done seven or eight books with him.

19:21.432 --> 19:23.715
And I also just gave a lecture out there for him.

19:23.755 --> 19:28.982
And he sent me this beautiful book, which you might like to just do as a curiosity.

19:30.059 --> 19:32.142
I think you're interested in my book.

19:32.202 --> 19:36.889
This is not one of the ones I did, but this is what I got as a prize.

19:37.470 --> 19:41.597
Andrew's a character, isn't it?

19:41.617 --> 19:44.020
Well, I mean, it's a unique thing that he's doing.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.843
It's extraordinary.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.265
It's extraordinary.

19:47.305 --> 19:51.692
But to do it successfully, I think you showed it.

19:51.752 --> 19:54.216
Did you show your biofilm?

19:55.598 --> 19:57.000
I mean, it's extremely dying.

19:57.481 --> 19:58.362
That's fabulous.

19:58.730 --> 20:03.355
I love the binding because it's got this little pocket so neat.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.277
I mean, I've never seen that in a book binding before.

20:06.317 --> 20:13.404
And you could just take out the little thing with an essay by Andrew and things about Franco-Hara and so forth.

20:13.985 --> 20:20.732
And then, I won't trouble you with it all, but each page has a dying thing on it.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.218
And the poem, some of them are just pings, but then some of them, the poem has

20:27.940 --> 20:40.091
So it's the biggest artist's book I have ever had anything to do with.

20:40.171 --> 20:56.766
I think poems should be placed on pages in accordance with their shape and form so that when

20:57.758 --> 21:03.228
I did the limited edition of Stevens, selected Stevens with Andrew.

21:05.031 --> 21:09.640
Stevens' poems are written in tercets, many of them, the wrong ones.

21:09.660 --> 21:14.329
And many of them may have cantos made of ten tercets.

21:15.531 --> 21:18.957
And in the collective poems, they run over from page to page.

21:19.392 --> 21:27.582
And because some of the lines and the tercets are long, they have turnovers, so the tercets don't look beautiful anymore because they would have four lines because of a turnover.

21:28.403 --> 21:36.354
And I said to Andrew, all I want is that the book be wide enough so there'll be no turnovers, and that long enough so we can get ten cantos, ten tercets on a page.

21:36.394 --> 21:41.801
See, this is what the internet tells the paratextual element itself, where the internet could never do... Well, they could.

21:41.821 --> 21:43.703
They can format things on the internet.

21:43.783 --> 21:44.284
I suppose.

21:44.304 --> 21:49.230
They can even do, now I take it, stop the split screen so you can do marginal annotations.

21:49.598 --> 21:52.683
Maybe people will get used to it.

21:52.703 --> 22:01.017
But the way the artist designs it is the way it ought to appear in the printing page or the published page, do you think?

22:01.037 --> 22:01.357
Yes.

22:01.538 --> 22:07.007
I think, yes, of course, the way the artist wants it to look, but commercial publishing can't usually observe that.

22:07.668 --> 22:11.734
And so it's only in artists' books that you can really do it right, I think.

22:12.636 --> 22:16.382
And when Andrew did Shakespeare's Florence, he did

22:17.071 --> 22:24.499
only one sonnet per page, so it's a nice little square book, and, you know, it's just sonnet, sonnet.

22:24.519 --> 22:27.663
So how did you find each other, Andrew and yourself?

22:27.723 --> 22:35.412
Well, Andrew did a book which he may have showed you called Self-Fortrait and Convex Mirror of Ashbury and a Big Steel Drum with Convex Mirror.

22:35.852 --> 22:36.353
Extraordinary.

22:36.653 --> 22:37.374
Printed radio.

22:37.434 --> 22:41.779
And so I got a call out of the blue from Andrew.

22:42.232 --> 22:52.203
saying that John Ashbery had suggested that I do the liner notes for the recording of South Portrait that's included in the book, the CD, I mean, not CD, uh, LP.

22:53.324 --> 22:54.445
So I thought, that's fun.

22:54.485 --> 22:56.348
I love South Portrait and the Convex Mirror.

22:56.728 --> 22:57.349
Great poem.

22:57.369 --> 22:58.610
So I did the liner notes.

22:58.630 --> 23:01.113
And then from there, the other projects grew.

23:01.133 --> 23:02.594
I mean, Andrew was pleased with it.

23:03.175 --> 23:04.436
Ashbery was pleased with it.

23:04.496 --> 23:08.601
And so I had passed some kind of test, I guess, with Ashbery's approval.

23:09.262 --> 23:10.483
And because Andrew comes out of that,

23:11.020 --> 23:15.325
New York slash West Coast art.

23:15.345 --> 23:23.315
And so the last one we did was a sequence called Squarings by, maybe he showed you that too, I don't know, Seamus Heaney.

23:23.836 --> 23:29.022
And they're called Squarings because they are 12-line poems and four tercets.

23:30.064 --> 23:32.306
And so they're different from sonnets.

23:32.366 --> 23:40.116
I mean, they're close in shape and length to sonnets, but because they have four pieces and they're only 12 lines, they're different.

23:40.417 --> 23:45.824
And they looked square on the page instead of looking rectangular like a sonnet, and that's why Seamus called them squaring.

23:46.645 --> 23:58.861
So we did a very beautiful volume of squaring with Saul LeWitt doing facing page lithographs and whatever they are.

23:58.881 --> 24:03.948
And that was, I think, a big success in terms of format and layout.

24:03.968 --> 24:05.390
So he's very inventive.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.673
Have you seen his voice on the Presidio?

24:08.159 --> 24:09.080
Yes, I was just there.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.803
That's where I gave the lecture that he gave me the book for.

24:11.903 --> 24:14.425
Yes, it's a beautiful place.

24:14.485 --> 24:16.667
I want to write about it.

24:17.088 --> 24:25.276
One last question, because when you said that, it reminded me that I said, could I see the type in some of the drawers?

24:25.436 --> 24:32.463
And he pulled out a drawer, and it was a very thin type.

24:32.963 --> 24:36.647
It was absolutely...

24:37.572 --> 24:44.599
exactly the correspondence to a wonderful poem by Walt Whitman, which you may or may not know, called A Font of Type.

24:44.940 --> 24:45.700
Do you know that one?

24:45.720 --> 24:46.321
I do know that one.

24:46.341 --> 24:46.421
Yes.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.142
That's what I do.

24:47.182 --> 24:49.464
Within the pallid slippers slumbering.

24:49.504 --> 24:51.206
And there they were, the pallid slippers.

24:51.807 --> 24:56.572
And I think that's the best poem written about the potential of the alphabet.

24:57.112 --> 25:00.256
What it can generate, those 26 letters.

25:00.516 --> 25:04.019
And there's another one you said about the application of your peers.

25:04.039 --> 25:06.482
I mean, he, you know, Whitman.

25:07.846 --> 25:15.252
This book is self-published, I believe, the greatest humanity book in the history of America, but he gets the approbation of Emerson.

25:15.273 --> 25:16.614
Emerson and Thoreau.

25:16.634 --> 25:18.275
And Thoreau and others.

25:18.535 --> 25:21.238
That's the big start.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.519
That's the big one.

25:22.539 --> 25:33.348
But isn't that interesting that Emerson was large-minded enough so that when this self-published book came in, by this net, he could say, greatest piece of wit and wisdom, you know.

25:33.529 --> 25:37.532
The title of my new book is from a quote from Emerson, which is on the, I mean,

25:37.867 --> 26:03.165
where's the first wonderland what's the feminine it's it's the epigraph which i my wife and i discovered in a in a volume of the dial magazine which we rescued at a discard sale wow and uh and oh you mentioned that that's on your website yeah yeah yeah and emerson i have the same so but my wife they were throwing away these styles for five dollars

26:03.533 --> 26:13.283
What is this chapter there I call shelf life, and it's all about the politics of discards, and all from 50-cent discards all the way up to million-dollar discards.

26:13.303 --> 26:14.864
Not throwing them away, but selling them.

26:14.884 --> 26:19.469
The Massachusetts Borticultural Society selling off their... Their sales records?

26:19.489 --> 26:20.670
No, they sold their books.

26:20.851 --> 26:21.111
Oh, yeah.

26:21.131 --> 26:24.554
In fact, I did an RFID piece for The Globe a couple months ago.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.176
I'll email it to you.

26:26.296 --> 26:28.498
Yeah, I was probably... Do you read your email?

26:28.558 --> 26:33.203
If you don't mind, I'll... This email goes to my secretary at Peralta, yeah.

26:33.453 --> 26:34.274
Yes.

26:34.294 --> 26:40.180
Actually, I have it on my website, the Boston Globe piece, the update piece.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.183
Well, I can find it on your website, because I saw that.

26:43.203 --> 26:49.510
Well, they sold all the books at Christie's, and a guy in Chicago tracked one down, and it already chopped up, and they're taking it over.

26:49.530 --> 26:50.751
All the illustrations, yeah.

26:50.771 --> 27:00.321
And I went to Chicago just to pay my respects to this cannibalized book, and I wrote it for the Globe the week before the spring flopper.

27:00.638 --> 27:13.818
But you used to say, oh, you got your blood money, you know, you got your five million dollars for breaking up what was ideally the greatest horticultural and botanic library in North America, you know, to continue doing this.

27:13.838 --> 27:18.104
And the rationale was nobody reads them anymore.

27:18.124 --> 27:19.026
Nobody uses the books now.

27:19.046 --> 27:21.269
Well, they were, was it, wasn't it something you did?

27:21.289 --> 27:25.115
They were throwing away the books that nobody had taken out during the past year?

27:25.135 --> 27:26.697
Yeah, well, that's, I wrote that.

27:26.717 --> 27:27.378
Yeah, yeah.

27:28.239 --> 27:28.620
How do you believe?

27:29.005 --> 27:37.453
Well, that's my shelf life, but that's the Emerson quote that inspired the title of this book.

27:37.473 --> 27:38.774
But I love Emerson.

27:40.116 --> 27:45.141
You talk about writing that really does hold up and resonate anytime you read it.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.403
Yes, he does hold up.

27:47.543 --> 27:53.909
And besides, I think his journals and notebooks were fascinating.

27:53.929 --> 27:58.894
Apparently, his reading was very documented, and even while he was at Harvard,

27:59.448 --> 28:04.795
He's a professor at Amherst down there.

28:04.856 --> 28:08.040
He's kind of the Amherst scholar.

28:08.401 --> 28:11.124
His great collection is now in South Carolina.

28:11.144 --> 28:12.146
His works.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.047
Documents the reading?

28:13.247 --> 28:15.010
Yeah, I don't know.

28:15.110 --> 28:19.136
I think he might even have read over at the F&M at some point.

28:19.276 --> 28:21.279
I can see that this is going to be fun.

28:21.379 --> 28:24.443
That's a fun book.

28:25.199 --> 28:27.622
It's like the Mickelson's Berkshire stuff about that.

28:27.642 --> 28:35.351
Well, yeah, well, Baker and I are more of an activist, and I write about him in here, and I write about him in my Patience and Fortune book.

28:35.371 --> 28:38.334
Well, it's true that if you microfilm things, a lot gets lost.

28:39.255 --> 28:41.198
Microfilming is done very carefully.

28:41.218 --> 28:43.500
Remember Father Boyle at the Vatican Library?

28:43.600 --> 28:53.552
He was the librarian, and I quote him in there about, he was editing the Aquinas project, the 250-year project.

28:53.870 --> 29:23.067
whatever it is they were about a hundred years into it and they had one commentary come in and he said the guy got it all wrong you know you have to read it in there and he said what the heck and he said what the hell actually was Robert Boyle said and so they discussed it he was at a conference at the bar at Oxford and he said I nipped off to go to the because he had worked at the bar yeah I said something's wrong here and then he looked at it and I looked at it

29:23.823 --> 29:25.345
And he said, well, go to hell.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.408
There was an annotation in the margin.

29:28.269 --> 29:30.893
He says, well, go to hell.

29:30.913 --> 29:31.874
This is a priest, you know.

29:32.555 --> 29:36.481
And he said he missed, he must have read it off a microfilm.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.263
They only gave him the whole opening.

29:38.283 --> 29:43.831
And everything that would have explained what was missing, I'm paraphrasing.

29:43.851 --> 29:45.133
It's been a while since I wrote it.

29:45.153 --> 29:53.745
But the whole culture of the copy, the surrogate, why is the artifact

29:54.181 --> 29:57.966
The original copy is still essential to scholars.

29:57.986 --> 30:03.554
You'll see from that one fellow, Xerox, that's a little machine.

30:03.754 --> 30:06.678
And so it came out their face.

30:06.858 --> 30:10.864
There's a whole chapter in there on copies.

30:10.964 --> 30:17.072
Well, I argue, I write, if you were to suggest, what would you say is the greatest work of scholarship done from a copy?

30:18.334 --> 30:20.577
It's easy if you think about it.

30:21.940 --> 30:26.146
Champollion, the first time he ever saw the Rosetta Stone was afterwards.

30:27.748 --> 30:28.729
They wouldn't let him see it.

30:28.989 --> 30:30.712
Don't forget, he was a Frenchman.

30:33.455 --> 30:35.418
They had ceded the stone to the Brits.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.063
He was working off imperfect copies.

30:39.703 --> 30:44.830
Actually, they had used the stone as a lithographic stone.

30:45.231 --> 30:50.057
When they cleaned it up just a few years ago, they still found printer's ink in the Rosetta Stone.

30:50.273 --> 30:59.462
He'd asked for a new cast, because there was another scholar working in England trying to be the one to do it first, wouldn't give him what he wanted.

31:00.163 --> 31:13.996
But there was another stone, actually, a trilingual stone that they found, a bilingual, but it was the name for Cleopatra, which kind of validated or confirmed one of his findings.

31:14.637 --> 31:16.219
And that was a work of genius?

31:16.239 --> 31:17.580
It was a work of genius.

31:17.881 --> 31:20.925
But it was from Syracuse, from copies.

31:21.486 --> 31:30.458
But then he said later, Well, I would think so.

31:30.518 --> 31:31.739
I write about the Mayan glyphs.

31:31.799 --> 31:36.365
They burned, that Bishop Lander burned in one day 20,000 books.

31:37.747 --> 31:43.274
And there were all these beautiful books made from the bark of these trees because, of course, they were pagan.

31:43.315 --> 31:45.217
They were pagan, exactly.

31:46.699 --> 31:47.500
They were pagan, yeah.

31:48.458 --> 31:58.631
But the stones survived, and four books survived, and they were sent to Europe with Curiosities.

31:58.652 --> 32:08.384
And it was from those four books, what is called the Madrid Codex, and there was a Dresden, and there was something else, and there was one for the Greatest, and there was a Dresden Club.

32:09.145 --> 32:12.610
And it was from those four, and there was a Leshing, a Leshing epigrapher.

32:12.826 --> 32:15.950
who was a codebreaker during World Watch.

32:16.030 --> 32:19.335
It's only recently in the United States.

32:19.635 --> 32:26.965
And what they found, I'm trying to get all excited about this, but Landa had written, he had been called back by the Inquisition.

32:26.985 --> 32:28.567
He was really, terribly cool.

32:29.288 --> 32:33.894
And so the Inquisition called you back because he was doing bad things.

32:33.914 --> 32:38.260
And so he had to explain his behavior while in Mexico.

32:38.695 --> 32:41.918
And while he did, he wrote a little thing over the alphabet.

32:41.979 --> 32:45.823
He'd put the symbols and put in what the sounds mean, working with something.

32:45.843 --> 32:48.105
So he did it like Eliot with the English.

32:48.125 --> 32:48.405
Yeah, exactly.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.066
And it was fun.

32:49.166 --> 32:58.716
And then using that and the four surviving books, this Russian was able to do it.

32:58.736 --> 33:01.760
And then that was the whole key, breaking the Maya code.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.041
It's wonderful.

33:03.762 --> 33:04.142
Wonderful, yes.

33:04.162 --> 33:07.206
And it's trusted as the one remaining language.

33:07.226 --> 33:08.567
And it's our alphabet.

33:09.256 --> 33:14.945
A number of scholars say, you know, for a language, we can't understand a lot of the words.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.527
It's very familiar.

33:16.767 --> 33:20.733
Is that because there's no bilingual thing hanging about it?

33:20.753 --> 33:22.696
Yeah, well, there are 13,000 entrusted documents.

33:22.776 --> 33:24.419
There are a few, and I mentioned them.

33:24.439 --> 33:28.225
They find a few, but they're not bilingual translations.

33:28.265 --> 33:30.809
They are parallel descriptions.

33:30.829 --> 33:31.470
They come close.

33:31.490 --> 33:32.631
They don't have a lot of the words.

33:32.752 --> 33:34.114
There's a couple of the scholars.

33:34.134 --> 33:36.377
Well, maybe something will turn off.

33:37.049 --> 33:46.624
It really has to be the... Do a Lexus Nexus sometime on Rosetta Stone.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.008
Computers are stupid.

33:49.068 --> 33:53.775
If you ask them to look for Rosetta Stone, it'll give you 5,000 hits.

33:53.795 --> 33:56.559
But none of them are really talking about the Rosetta Stone.

33:56.980 --> 33:58.623
They'll say, this is the Rosetta Stone.

33:58.683 --> 34:01.487
I will never use that phrase.

34:01.568 --> 34:09.321
When you see it, how often is the Rosetta Stone of motorcycle racing, or something that is quite a dot.

34:10.082 --> 34:20.700
So you have to put Rosetta Stone and Champollion or something, and then you might get... Well, I mean, I would never use it as a metaphor, you know, this is a Rosetta Stone.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.565
But I'd be looking it up to get the right Rosetta Stone.

34:23.685 --> 34:28.032
Oh, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, well, what you do, Rosetta Stone, you put down Champollion, you put down

34:28.265 --> 34:30.568
uh, hieroglyphics would probably get it for you.

34:30.588 --> 34:31.610
I don't know what that would be.

34:32.191 --> 34:35.635
And then, but what if I speak to you?

34:35.736 --> 34:39.561
So, what are you wasting your time in the computer for?

34:39.921 --> 34:41.604
You've got the book out.

34:41.624 --> 34:42.946
I just got it too.

34:44.288 --> 34:48.113
It is foreign still to me, even though I used to do it all day.

34:49.355 --> 34:53.040
I use it all day with my eyes and it's filled my eyes on it.

34:53.307 --> 34:56.407
That's the other thing.

34:56.488 --> 34:58.440
She has a very gassy eye.

34:59.062 --> 35:00.764
But you can't move the screen.

35:00.784 --> 35:02.567
You know, people say you take it to bed.

35:02.587 --> 35:09.255
But the fact is, you have to adjust your back, your chair, your eyes, and it's not tight, it's a pixel.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.458
It's a flickering pixel.

35:11.478 --> 35:16.244
And it's not good to the eyes, and it's not good to the hands.

35:16.264 --> 35:17.807
I don't have coupled tunnels.

35:17.827 --> 35:18.347
I don't know.

35:18.628 --> 35:21.051
Coupled tunnels.

35:21.111 --> 35:21.832
Yeah.

35:22.653 --> 35:23.834
But you haven't got that.

35:23.854 --> 35:28.140
No, I've got big hands, but I couldn't... Well, it's something to do, but I do get something to do.

35:28.492 --> 35:41.834
Writing the kinds of books I do, you always find any detail that you want to insert someplace.

35:41.854 --> 35:43.196
It's very practical.

35:43.216 --> 35:44.779
It's so much easier.

35:45.215 --> 35:57.569
And I will be in touch with you.

35:57.669 --> 36:04.477
And if there's any follow-up, you won't mind my getting in touch.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.618
Thank you for this.

36:05.878 --> 36:07.560
That's wonderful.

36:08.232 --> 36:12.276
And, you know, oh, there'll be an interesting little book.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.357
You know, plenty of books.

36:13.377 --> 36:13.918
That's a good statement.

36:13.978 --> 36:15.119
Thank you for your book.

36:15.139 --> 36:16.641
Would you like one of mine?

36:16.661 --> 36:18.562
I have your books first.

36:18.582 --> 36:25.349
Do you have the latest one?

36:25.369 --> 36:26.330
All right.

36:27.532 --> 36:28.533
I don't.

36:34.819 --> 36:35.019
All right.

36:35.039 --> 36:35.359
I'll look at it.

36:35.379 --> 36:35.740
No, let me see it.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.662
That's not quite exciting.

36:37.682 --> 36:37.902
I will, uh,

36:38.202 --> 36:59.266
I have to move all of my... I think that's why we can do it.

36:59.286 --> 37:07.095
I have all of these.

37:08.003 --> 37:10.949
She's actually going to read books.

37:10.969 --> 37:12.231
And you write about them.

37:12.251 --> 37:13.033
I write about them.

37:13.894 --> 37:14.335
I write about them.

37:14.355 --> 37:16.940
But there are books that I don't like to read.

37:16.960 --> 37:23.633
There are books that I don't like to read.

37:24.174 --> 37:27.360
There are books that I don't like to read.

37:27.380 --> 37:30.045
There are books that I don't like to read.

38:09.918 --> 38:34.710
... ... ... ... ...

38:50.857 --> 38:57.627
Yeah.

39:17.114 --> 39:22.030
.

39:22.050 --> 39:30.718
.

40:02.356 --> 40:03.103
Bye.
