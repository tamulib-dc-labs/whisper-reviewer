00:02.039 --> 00:05.042
because this might be interesting.

00:05.282 --> 00:07.124
Let me just put this over here.

00:07.184 --> 00:27.043
They had a big signing at Barnes & Noble on Friday last week for the three winners of the book award, and there were a lot of people there, and we signed a lot of books, but a whole bunch of people kept coming up with stacks of like five of the hard covers, which were extremely hard to find.

00:27.863 --> 00:29.565
What did I get your thoughts between these two?

00:29.714 --> 00:32.236
We have sparkling water with lemon.

00:36.441 --> 00:39.744
I'd like hot coffee.

00:39.904 --> 00:41.385
Ready?

00:41.445 --> 00:43.888
I'll bring those right after you.

00:43.908 --> 00:48.853
So first of all, I was curious where they'd gotten the hard coffees, because there aren't any, because it was a very small printing.

00:48.893 --> 00:50.835
They must have been doing this.

00:50.855 --> 00:51.255
They were.

00:51.275 --> 00:54.778
And second of all, I was curious as to why they had five.

00:54.859 --> 00:56.380
I thought they were just in their own people.

00:56.883 --> 01:00.367
You know, I know you like to read, but what's going on here?

01:00.387 --> 01:07.335
And she said that already a first edition, there was a small second printing, and I guess it has to be the first printing.

01:07.836 --> 01:09.598
A signed first edition is $85.

01:10.038 --> 01:14.103
So she brings me a $20 book, and I sign it, and she has an $85 book.

01:14.303 --> 01:18.268
Oh, it's with one of them.

01:18.288 --> 01:19.229
But that's okay.

01:19.269 --> 01:20.290
Yeah, it is okay.

01:20.370 --> 01:21.051
It was so weird.

01:21.071 --> 01:22.153
I never thought about that.

01:22.193 --> 01:22.553
I don't...

01:23.292 --> 01:29.462
I mean, I'm sort of aware people collect contemporary first editions, but it's not my world, and so this is news to me.

01:29.542 --> 01:33.889
But in fact, my guess also is that your earlier books are worth even more now.

01:34.089 --> 01:38.116
Well, people, it turned out... See, you can probably explain a lot of this to me.

01:38.136 --> 01:44.206
Of course, everyone's bringing in their earlier books in preference for the old hardcovers, all of which are out of print.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.152
But they seem most teased...

01:48.267 --> 01:55.976
to have gotten their sort of cruddy-looking review copies or advance copies of the old books, and they wanted those signs.

01:56.857 --> 02:03.864
From their perspective, even though, to my eyes, they're not nice to touch, I guess because they're rarer, maybe, because there are fewer of them.

02:03.904 --> 02:05.726
They seem pleased to have these.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.970
I personally have no interest in that.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.492
These are the galley groups, right?

02:10.752 --> 02:10.992
Yes.

02:12.274 --> 02:15.237
In some instances, they represent a variant state.

02:15.436 --> 02:19.421
Did you do many corrections on your values, for instance?

02:21.104 --> 02:26.351
Oh, I'm not one of these people who rewrites really heavily, but sure, I mean, I correct typos and a few lines.

02:26.871 --> 02:31.177
So therefore it represents an earliest state of the work.

02:31.738 --> 02:35.803
So what Clark is always looking for is the earliest possible state.

02:35.823 --> 02:40.029
And of course the fact of the scarcity, it's automatic scarcity.

02:40.129 --> 02:43.013
Somebody like Stephen King...

02:43.297 --> 02:47.825
let's say, you know, whose first editions are maybe issued at a million copies.

02:47.845 --> 02:50.229
Right, and there's only a thousand galleys, I suppose.

02:50.249 --> 02:52.513
There may not even be that many.

02:52.593 --> 02:57.963
The galleys are usually pretty consistent, maybe three or four hundred, if there are that many.

02:57.983 --> 02:58.604
Oh, that's interesting.

02:58.624 --> 03:00.387
So that's the drive for people.

03:00.447 --> 03:08.241
Yeah, but authors like Updike and Tyler do revise to the point that even...

03:08.542 --> 03:36.321
I forget which Tyler novel it was, they actually had to issue a second set of proofs because she had revised it so heavily and it had different color of paper so I think it's the accidental tourists first state proof and second state proof, you know, but uh the only reason I mentioned this times thing is I believe I'm going to feature your book as an example of what an award can do. Oh how fun

03:36.790 --> 03:40.697
Because they asked me to kind of take a look at new books.

03:41.278 --> 03:43.642
And then I said, well, will you look at the bestseller list and see?

03:43.702 --> 03:45.204
I said, that's kind of an oxymoron.

03:45.224 --> 03:49.371
I mean, there's nothing collectible on the bestseller list that I can possibly see.

03:49.412 --> 03:51.816
I'd be happy to comment on it, you know.

03:53.218 --> 03:55.682
But how has the National Book Award changed your life?

03:55.782 --> 03:59.068
Maybe we can just enter the conversation.

04:00.230 --> 04:06.997
Well, I suppose in ways that were utterly predictable to everyone but me, but not predictable to me.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.839
Did you want to?

04:09.159 --> 04:14.585
She has to go across the street to some books in a while, so maybe it would be a good idea.

04:14.605 --> 04:19.290
So we were talking about... Yeah, about that.

04:20.030 --> 04:23.414
You know, it's changed a lot of things in ways that I just had no idea.

04:23.434 --> 04:27.418
I'd never done a book tour, for instance.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.126
I mean, this is my fifth book, but I never went on a book tour.

04:31.246 --> 04:35.834
I was very out of sort of this kind of way of publishing a book.

04:35.894 --> 04:42.245
I had a lovely editor and nice publishers, but I was always published quite quietly, pretty small editions.

04:42.406 --> 04:48.056
Ten thousand books was a lot of books for me, and the times that they published ten thousand, they didn't sell them all.

04:48.096 --> 04:51.482
Sometimes they didn't even come close.

04:51.698 --> 04:53.641
So this is just like another world.

04:53.861 --> 04:59.809
Do you know what your, what your, how many copies of the earlier books were published, just out of curiosity?

05:00.330 --> 05:14.670
Um, it varies from book to book, but the, um, the first one was issued as a paperback original, and it was, yeah, and that's the one that, from a collector's point of view, people, it's out of print, it was an original, people are like, So it's never been in cloth?

05:15.151 --> 05:20.558
No, never, so people come up to me now with this little pattern thing in the plastic bag, if they can find it, um,

05:20.993 --> 05:25.078
And it was used as the lunch book for what was then a new series called Delta.

05:25.098 --> 05:27.221
It was sort of Delacourte's version.

05:29.303 --> 05:31.086
I think they may have printed twelve of that.

05:31.106 --> 05:34.690
They were very hopeful for that, because they were trying to start off this new line.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.091
Twelve thousand?

05:35.111 --> 05:35.972
Twelve thousand, yeah.

05:36.573 --> 05:38.655
And I was a new writer, and it was a new line.

05:38.675 --> 05:43.161
And for a first book it was nice.

05:43.181 --> 05:45.804
I don't think they sold all those, but they did okay.

05:45.824 --> 05:48.908
And after that it was sort of downhill.

05:49.512 --> 05:52.536
I read someplace that you trained as a zoologist.

05:52.557 --> 05:53.097
Is that correct?

05:53.378 --> 05:53.939
Yeah.

05:53.959 --> 05:59.647
I went to—I did an undergraduate degree in biology and very— Which is where?

05:59.667 --> 06:00.288
Where was this?

06:00.388 --> 06:02.952
Union College in Schenectady.

06:02.972 --> 06:06.677
And went extremely briefly to a Ph.D.

06:06.717 --> 06:09.141
program in zoology at UMass Amherst.

06:09.593 --> 06:12.176
But by extremely briefly, I mean like six weeks.

06:12.256 --> 06:15.079
I didn't even get close to making it through my first semester.

06:15.099 --> 06:17.222
I was so not cut out to do that.

06:17.842 --> 06:21.667
And what would you have done as a zoologist?

06:21.687 --> 06:31.298
What I wanted to do and what I didn't understand and I couldn't do, I wanted to do what Alfred Russell Wallace had done or what Bates had done in the Amazon or what Darwin had done in the Galapagos.

06:31.698 --> 06:31.959
Really?

06:32.219 --> 06:32.880
Yeah, really.

06:33.140 --> 06:33.981
You know, I thought that

06:34.315 --> 06:39.622
What I wanted to do was natural history, and I didn't understand that that wasn't what 20th century biology was about.

06:39.642 --> 06:44.288
I wanted to go off on a sailing ship and go someplace and discover birds and name them all.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.411
I was so naive.

06:46.431 --> 06:47.192
I was very young.

06:47.873 --> 06:48.935
It was my only excuse.

06:50.016 --> 06:51.578
Why do you say naive?

06:51.638 --> 06:52.760
That sounds like a nice dream.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.621
Why not?

06:54.542 --> 06:56.064
Why not dream about something like that?

06:56.084 --> 07:00.390
Yeah, it was a good dream, but when I got to graduate school, I realized

07:01.147 --> 07:12.244
There's big equipment, and people want me to design experiments and cut molecules and do genes and keep a laboratory no-fucking.

07:12.264 --> 07:16.049
So the romantic element of it wasn't there?

07:16.189 --> 07:22.479
Actually, 20th century science is romantic in its own way, but it's not a way that is accessible to me.

07:22.519 --> 07:27.306
My husband is a structural biologist, works with very large equipment.

07:27.691 --> 07:30.155
and very tiny things that are invisible to see.

07:30.175 --> 07:33.180
And he does this in industry, or he teaches?

07:33.461 --> 07:35.765
He's at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

07:35.785 --> 07:37.368
He just does research.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.231
He does X-ray crystallography.

07:39.431 --> 07:40.834
You know what that is?

07:41.695 --> 07:41.795
Nope.

07:42.136 --> 07:43.318
Say it once again for my tape.

07:43.739 --> 07:45.482
It's X-ray crystallography.

07:45.502 --> 07:47.004
Okay, X-ray crystallography.

07:47.205 --> 07:50.931
And you've seen pictures of the double helix.

07:51.603 --> 07:59.697
You know, besides the two strands that twine around, there are all those little balls, and those little balls are the atoms that go together to form the molecule.

07:59.717 --> 08:13.662
And crystallography is a technique of determining how the atoms are fitted next to each other in three-dimensional space, both how they lie next to each other and then how those strands curl, or in some molecules...

08:14.063 --> 08:17.127
You know, they bunch, they clump, they lump, they do all sorts of things.

08:17.427 --> 08:18.048
It's neat.

08:18.068 --> 08:21.071
Why don't you have some of your salads?

08:21.131 --> 08:22.693
I don't either, so I'm not proud.

08:22.713 --> 08:34.807
I mean, that's very romantic, and I love learning about that, and I love watching him do it, and tons of my friends are scientists.

08:34.827 --> 08:39.292
But all of that science is, at its core, really mathematical.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.636
You and I can talk about it metaphorically and visually,

08:42.920 --> 08:46.584
Neither of us can do the math, I'm guessing.

08:46.665 --> 08:49.448
I really have a hard time understanding it, too.

08:49.768 --> 08:51.250
Oh, it's the same salad dressing.

08:51.571 --> 08:52.011
It is.

08:52.031 --> 08:56.797
That's good.

08:57.458 --> 09:01.763
I have a hard time with math, and I'm also not very analytic at all.

09:03.205 --> 09:09.012
I think if I have a strength at all, it's probably that I'm a good synthesizer.

09:09.329 --> 09:20.023
I don't know anything deeply or well, but I know a lot of things lightly or shallowly, and I'm capable of synthesizing things from improbably distant disciplines sometimes.

09:20.364 --> 09:25.531
But I don't actually know any discipline, and that's not a good trait either for a scientist.

09:25.551 --> 09:30.618
But you certainly use this knowledge and these perceptions.

09:30.778 --> 09:31.078
Yeah.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.663
And it was fun getting back to it.

09:34.683 --> 09:36.065
Tell me how that happened.

09:37.167 --> 09:37.547
Yeah.

09:39.248 --> 09:41.631
It came from a couple different directions.

09:41.752 --> 09:46.358
I had written four novels back-to-back, a little atypically.

09:47.700 --> 09:53.048
I had not started my writing career making stories and then trying to edge my way up to a novel.

09:53.108 --> 09:56.353
I started writing a novel, and that's how I taught myself to write.

09:56.473 --> 09:59.137
That's very interesting that you come to the story.

09:59.538 --> 10:00.099
Yeah, I know.

10:00.139 --> 10:02.542
I do everything backwards.

10:02.562 --> 10:03.163
I really do.

10:03.183 --> 10:08.631
So I spent about six years trying to teach myself to write.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.830
by writing a novel over and over and over again.

10:11.891 --> 10:13.833
It was a horrible novel.

10:13.873 --> 10:14.874
I had to throw it out.

10:15.435 --> 10:16.857
But that's what I learned to write on.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.421
Starting about when?

10:20.441 --> 10:21.002
About 1978.

10:21.022 --> 10:24.466
You were young?

10:25.387 --> 10:29.032
Well, I was, but I felt old.

10:29.072 --> 10:30.013
I'd always been in a hurry.

10:30.073 --> 10:31.775
I was 16 when I went to college.

10:31.815 --> 10:33.578
I was 19 when I got out of college.

10:33.658 --> 10:37.943
And then I was in and out of graduate school twice, and I had

10:38.362 --> 10:42.566
I once figured out thirteen jobs in ten years, and I felt really quite battered.

10:42.606 --> 10:43.587
What kinds of jobs?

10:43.607 --> 10:44.348
Oh, the worst.

10:45.149 --> 10:46.330
I worked in a greenhouse.

10:46.410 --> 10:52.156
I worked only for three days as an assistant to a dental surgeon, but I fainted nine times the first day.

10:53.017 --> 10:54.238
I faint when there's blood around.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.299
It was not a good job.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.942
So you took the job knowing that you faint when there was blood.

10:57.962 --> 10:58.923
Well, I didn't know.

10:58.943 --> 11:01.145
I didn't know there was going to be so much blood.

11:01.526 --> 11:03.708
And I was really desperate.

11:03.728 --> 11:04.849
I was so broke then.

11:04.909 --> 11:07.592
I worked in a box factory.

11:08.467 --> 11:12.652
I worked at all kinds of secretarial jobs and clerical jobs.

11:12.732 --> 11:14.615
I worked in a college development office.

11:14.755 --> 11:17.819
I typed tax forms for three Swedenborgian accountants.

11:17.919 --> 11:18.820
I just did everything.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.445
And this is after having graduated from college in nineteen?

11:22.465 --> 11:22.565
Yes.

11:22.665 --> 11:25.168
I mean, you must have been— I couldn't do anything.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.732
An exceedingly bright young woman.

11:28.753 --> 11:32.657
You're nice to say so, but if I was, I was certainly one with no skills.

11:32.677 --> 11:35.100
And also, I got out of college in nineteen seventy-four.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.123
You may recall there was a big recession.

11:37.390 --> 11:43.717
There was no work, especially for someone who couldn't, I mean, I really had no skills.

11:43.898 --> 11:46.441
So did you just kind of come to writing?

11:46.461 --> 11:49.584
Or was it something that you always enjoyed or aspired to?

11:49.744 --> 11:50.986
Did you write as a kid?

11:51.567 --> 11:52.347
Not so much.

11:52.368 --> 11:55.091
Did you know that you had ability in it?

11:55.711 --> 11:59.836
No, I read passionately and wildly since I'm a tiny, tiny girl.

11:59.896 --> 12:03.060
My mother taught me to read somehow before I went to kindergarten.

12:03.209 --> 12:09.459
which was actually at Brown Street Elementary School, which is probably bulldozed now, but used to be about half a mile from here.

12:10.680 --> 12:22.058
And I just read omnivorously, but it wasn't the kind of family and we didn't lead the kind of life that it was even really possible for me to think the thought that I could be a writer.

12:22.078 --> 12:27.546
I didn't meet a writer, a living writer, until I was 28, 29.

12:28.100 --> 12:34.366
I went to a small high school on Cape Cod that was then in a sort of semi-rural area.

12:34.406 --> 12:35.847
There was no arts programming.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.350
Where was this on the Cape?

12:38.370 --> 12:41.733
We moved to a lot of different places, but we were then living in Centerville.

12:41.753 --> 12:45.136
I went to Barnstable High School, which now is very civilized.

12:45.176 --> 12:45.997
They have lockers.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.378
They have gym classes.

12:48.199 --> 12:50.381
But none of this was true when I was there.

12:52.163 --> 12:56.807
Not so many people went on to college from that place when I was there.

12:58.390 --> 13:06.704
I don't know, I just wasn't imaginative enough, I guess, to conceive that one could be a writer, and I loved biology, so that's what I did.

13:09.168 --> 13:11.152
People would say, why don't you be an English major?

13:11.172 --> 13:12.314
You love to read so much.

13:12.334 --> 13:23.773
I was like, but I'm going to college, and it costs all this money, and I do this anyway, and I love it so much, and so I should learn something that I can't do, which, of course, now seems to be the height of stupidity.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.485
In fact, I never had an English course in college, and I regret this so passionately.

13:28.545 --> 13:32.430
Now, I never learned Shakespeare with a great teacher.

13:32.510 --> 13:35.073
I never did the English poets with a great teacher.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.415
All my life, I'm Captain Dink.

13:38.216 --> 13:39.818
Do you regret it?

13:39.838 --> 13:40.739
That's very interesting.

13:40.939 --> 13:41.900
I'm working on a new book.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.303
Pardon me for just making it up.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.826
And I'm going to consider the Canada Wars.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.428
It's just one chapter.

13:49.249 --> 13:50.250
And, of course, now...

13:50.973 --> 13:58.268
You can get a degree in English literature without being required to study Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.392
Well, you'll pardon me, but I'm old-fashioned.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.455
I think that's just wrong.

14:01.535 --> 14:02.697
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

14:02.717 --> 14:03.479
Yeah.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.970
And here you are bemoaning, you weren't even an English major, and you bemoaned on having studied Shakespeare.

14:08.990 --> 14:09.471
Well, I...

14:09.704 --> 14:11.886
I had to do that all by myself.

14:12.127 --> 14:14.109
Which I consider the greatest course I had.

14:14.369 --> 14:15.791
It changed my life, I can say.

14:15.811 --> 14:16.091
Really?

14:16.391 --> 14:17.452
Studying Shakespeare.

14:17.653 --> 14:19.094
I love it when people say that.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.356
But a lot of people do.

14:20.416 --> 14:33.770
They say, you know, in the hands of a really wonderful teacher, if anyway you love books and you're sensitive to language, to do things like read Paradise Lost or The Great Tragedies with a Good Teacher is transfiguring.

14:33.910 --> 14:34.751
And I missed all that.

14:34.771 --> 14:37.614
I read Paradise Lost for the first time three years ago.

14:37.674 --> 14:38.175
And

14:38.459 --> 14:45.448
It was transfiguring, and in a way it's great to come to it as an adult with all the things you already know.

14:45.528 --> 14:54.679
It's blindingly beautiful, but how lovely, too, to have been led through that by a real Milton scholar, by someone who can really open that up.

14:54.739 --> 14:55.780
I missed all that.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.321
I missed that.

14:56.341 --> 15:03.049
And I think to come to it again as a novel is even sweeter, because you have been ushered

15:03.687 --> 15:07.511
guided through it by, you know, having a Virgil to walk you through.

15:07.971 --> 15:09.113
I miss that Virgil.

15:09.733 --> 15:15.499
It seems to me a real deprivation to deny people that experience when they're young.

15:16.240 --> 15:22.726
I mean, I know people feel really passionately about this in the other direction, that, you know, it's sort of the dead white guy thing.

15:22.746 --> 15:23.848
We shouldn't have to do that.

15:23.948 --> 15:27.752
Dead white European males, is what they call it.

15:27.772 --> 15:29.894
Yeah, I know.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.137
And yet the things that shaped me as a writer are

15:33.910 --> 15:35.733
No Proust, no Tolstoy.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.097
No, I mean, that's what shaped me.

15:38.137 --> 15:49.336
Because I didn't have a teacher, and I didn't have a guide, and I didn't know from women's literature, and I didn't know a lot of things, really the things I read in those kind of formative years.

15:49.376 --> 15:54.044
You know that part in your life where just whatever you read sticks with you for the rest of your life?

15:54.124 --> 15:58.872
If people understood this more clearly, they'd be really careful about what they let their children read.

15:59.830 --> 16:04.617
And I think of those years as being sort of 12 to 19 or so.

16:04.637 --> 16:15.591
And what I read then was all the Russians, you know, all the Tolstoy, all the Dostoyevsky, the Proust, the Thomas Mann, the Conrad, the Forster, the Ford Maddox Ford.

16:15.652 --> 16:18.095
And that's probably why I sold fashion.

16:18.175 --> 16:21.319
I mean, that is in the absence of teachers or English courses.

16:21.359 --> 16:24.083
That's what sort of shaped my sense of language.

16:24.704 --> 16:28.510
and sound, and maybe that's bad in certain ways.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.112
It probably is bad in certain ways.

16:30.132 --> 16:33.757
I just wasn't exposed to anything else.

16:33.918 --> 16:35.901
But those are really wonderful writers.

16:35.941 --> 16:36.882
They're certainly worse models.

16:36.902 --> 16:39.245
How old were you when you were reading these songs?

16:40.307 --> 16:43.251
Oh, I'd probably say 12, 11, yeah.

16:43.532 --> 16:44.553
It's too young, I think.

16:44.573 --> 16:45.475
It's wonderful.

16:45.855 --> 16:46.536
I don't think so.

16:46.556 --> 16:47.758
I have her two daughters.

16:48.079 --> 16:54.508
My old daughter is 15, and she stuns me.

16:54.877 --> 16:57.880
Not only what she reads, but how quickly she reads.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.163
Yeah, we're like animals, and we're that old.

17:00.183 --> 17:03.006
I'm a professional reader, and she reads twice as fast.

17:03.186 --> 17:13.457
I think it's because if you start at a very early age, and she's reading adult books, and you get concerned about it every once in a while.

17:13.517 --> 17:13.817
I do.

17:14.077 --> 17:14.678
Oh, you shouldn't.

17:14.958 --> 17:15.439
You really shouldn't.

17:15.459 --> 17:20.344
Well, there was one book I didn't interview, which was Woman, Sapphire, called Push.

17:20.628 --> 17:21.569
Thought I'd worry about.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.251
And I said, jeez, Barbara.

17:23.492 --> 17:26.816
I said, I don't know if I would.

17:26.836 --> 17:27.356
That's rough.

17:27.376 --> 17:28.137
She said, trust me.

17:28.558 --> 17:30.180
And I have to trust her.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.922
Yeah, you do.

17:31.942 --> 17:34.685
And the fact is, that book, I liked it.

17:34.766 --> 17:37.929
I'm probably the only middle-aged white man you're going to see to say that.

17:37.970 --> 17:45.098
But I really like the fact that there is a... That's very powerful.

17:45.118 --> 17:48.863
There's a very triumphant aspect to it where this...

17:49.248 --> 17:57.044
young woman, this girl, is going to make it through reading, through this awareness of reading.

17:57.104 --> 18:01.232
And I think she did a wonderful job of traumatizing that at that point.

18:01.453 --> 18:01.914
I really do.

18:01.954 --> 18:03.457
I was quite moved by it.

18:04.799 --> 18:08.607
But anyway, I was concerned that my daughter must pick reading about this.

18:09.093 --> 18:14.401
girl who was raped by her father and had two children by him.

18:14.421 --> 18:21.391
I mean, I know why people worry, but I remember reading The Painted Bird when I was 14 or something.

18:21.431 --> 18:23.754
That's a really grim book.

18:25.056 --> 18:28.741
But I don't think it hurt me, really, to read it.

18:28.802 --> 18:32.307
It scared me and frightened me and made me sad, but it didn't hurt me.

18:32.327 --> 18:34.950
I did an interview in New York a couple months ago with Scott Turow.

18:35.051 --> 18:36.473
I've interviewed him forever.

18:36.493 --> 18:38.796
I like Scott.

18:39.282 --> 18:44.908
We were talking about the same stuff, and I asked him the same question.

18:44.928 --> 18:46.630
What do you think about Georgetown?

18:47.892 --> 18:51.996
It was Georgetown that started this.

18:52.297 --> 18:56.642
The English major doesn't have to study anything that the English major doesn't want to.

18:58.424 --> 18:59.685
And he said, I'll do you one better.

19:00.446 --> 19:02.168
He's an alum of Amherst College.

19:03.127 --> 19:20.460
Just the idea that it brings into question what it means at all to have an education, to say that you're an educated person, especially to come from a place like Harvard.

19:20.896 --> 19:24.981
Or Amherst, because Harvard did not go in with that, you know?

19:25.401 --> 19:40.099
I mean, Union is a wonderful school, and it was a very happy place for me, and I learned a lot, but in many ways I would have to say that at least in the world I live in now, I don't have an education, and I'm constantly trying to repair that.

19:40.139 --> 19:44.885
I sometimes feel like a Visikoff, who's sort of been let inside the gates.

19:45.786 --> 19:50.532
I teach at conferences and sometimes in graduate programs with

19:51.068 --> 19:59.817
such good writers who are both wonderful writers and also have what you and I would think of as a real literary education.

19:59.937 --> 20:06.443
So I'm very sharply aware all the time of all the things I don't know and how much I still have to learn.

20:06.463 --> 20:14.251
I learn a great deal from teaching with them, but it abashes me too to be sent out in the world without the education.

20:14.311 --> 20:16.333
It's no one's fault but my own.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.992
But you are teaching yourself so many different things.

20:21.895 --> 20:30.171
The reading list that you already described to me, that's a lot of self-education.

20:30.860 --> 20:51.670
i mean like all autodidacts i have surprising corners of erudition and equally surprising horrifying omissions and gaps you can teach yourself a lot and i'm very grateful for the things that i've learned but you can't teach yourself everything it's really nice to know other people who are

20:51.852 --> 20:53.934
smart and we'll teach you things.

20:53.994 --> 20:59.659
Let's go back then also again to the development of the fiction writer.

20:59.699 --> 21:01.781
You were working on this novel.

21:02.101 --> 21:04.564
The one that was published, is that the one that took six years?

21:04.744 --> 21:07.346
No, I had to throw the whole thing out.

21:07.406 --> 21:09.248
I had a sort of Cinderella story.

21:09.288 --> 21:10.129
I was so lucky.

21:11.810 --> 21:21.319
Writers, too, you can teach yourself to write up to a certain point and you can go quite a long way, but at some point somebody's got to hold out a hand and help you or you're in trouble.

21:21.839 --> 21:27.404
The way that hand got held out to me, I worked on this novel for about six years.

21:27.464 --> 21:29.586
When I started, I really couldn't write a sentence.

21:29.626 --> 21:31.428
I didn't know where to put quotation marks.

21:31.468 --> 21:32.489
I didn't know how to indent.

21:32.649 --> 21:33.570
No, I'm not kidding.

21:34.171 --> 21:35.512
You know, it's a big issue for me.

21:35.532 --> 21:37.954
Do they go inside the period, outside the paragraph?

21:37.974 --> 21:38.735
I knew nothing.

21:40.297 --> 21:44.661
So six years later, I went up to Bread Loaf, which is a writer's conference up in Vermont.

21:45.041 --> 21:51.087
As a student, I had a novel in my purse, the famous six-year novel, like everyone does who goes to a conference.

21:51.725 --> 21:55.709
And I also had a story that I had just started that seemed a little better.

21:55.769 --> 21:58.212
And I had two very nice teachers.

21:58.372 --> 22:06.640
One was Nicholas Delbanco, who's a quite wonderful writer who's been running the writing program out at Ann Arbor, but was then at Bennington.

22:07.481 --> 22:14.648
And the other was Thomas Gavin, who was teaching at the University of Rochester, which is where I ended up living, although that's just coincidence.

22:16.130 --> 22:19.133
And they were very sweet to me.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.494
Nick said, oh, that's a pretty good story.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.875
Have you ever written anything else?

22:22.975 --> 22:25.138
I said, well, I have this novel in my purse.

22:25.158 --> 22:28.281
And he said, well, let me take a look at it.

22:28.341 --> 22:35.088
And he took it home, and he actually read it in one night, which only now that I teach at conferences myself do I realize how extraordinary that was.

22:35.148 --> 22:36.189
It was incredible.

22:37.130 --> 22:45.079
And he sat me down the next day and did really the kindest thing I think any human being has ever done for me.

22:45.139 --> 22:46.420
He said, look...

22:46.822 --> 22:47.743
You're really talented.

22:47.763 --> 22:51.429
You can probably do this if you want, but you're never going to be able to save that novel.

22:51.489 --> 22:52.831
It's what you learn to write on.

22:53.953 --> 22:55.115
It's not a good idea.

22:55.135 --> 22:57.218
The pieces are never going to fit together.

22:57.238 --> 22:59.922
You need to just chuck that and move on.

23:00.122 --> 23:01.885
What a piece of advice that was.

23:02.085 --> 23:02.987
But he was right.

23:03.187 --> 23:09.497
And also now that I teach, I realize how extraordinarily hard it is to give that advice to someone.

23:09.517 --> 23:12.441
It's very hard to look a young person in the face.

23:12.910 --> 23:18.955
you know, that you know has worked that long, and tell them the truth, which is what they need to hear, I'm not sure I could do it.

23:19.476 --> 23:22.638
But, you know, I went home and cried for a day, and then I threw it out.

23:23.099 --> 23:24.300
And this was six years of work.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.901
It was six years of work.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.743
As far as I was concerned, it was my whole life.

23:28.183 --> 23:35.349
And I threw it out, and I started writing Lucid Stars, which was my first published novel, and I wouldn't have written it if he hadn't done that.

23:35.369 --> 23:37.211
And then how did that come to be a published work?

23:38.432 --> 23:42.175
By then, Nick and I stayed friends, and also Tom and I, and

23:42.425 --> 23:52.723
They both, without pay, and when they were both much too busy, they would let me mail things to them and look at them and sort of write letters back and tell me, oh, it's okay, it's okay, keep writing.

23:53.204 --> 24:02.020
And they introduced me to Wendy Weil, who has been my agent since then and still is, and is a very nice and lovely agent.

24:02.557 --> 24:04.580
And she was able to find a home for it.

24:04.620 --> 24:05.741
I was incredibly lucky.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.264
And the first publisher, I think, was Delta?

24:08.905 --> 24:16.695
It was Delta, a very good editor named Jane Rosenman, who was starting up this line that she's moved several times since then.

24:16.775 --> 24:23.383
I think she's the executive editor now at Scribner's, but was then a young editor at Delacorte.

24:24.765 --> 24:26.387
And she bought the first one.

24:26.519 --> 24:28.241
And she stayed with me through four books.

24:28.281 --> 24:30.503
She was also very kind to me.

24:31.344 --> 24:35.848
So you left with the stories for Norton?

24:35.868 --> 24:36.689
Actually, she left.

24:38.771 --> 24:42.995
We were together at Delacorte for two books, and then she moved to Pocket, and I went with her.

24:43.095 --> 24:51.824
But when she moved from Pocket to Scribner's, it was right around the same time that the stories were up, and it just sort of fell between the cracks.

24:52.865 --> 24:55.007
And so I moved to Norton with the stories.

24:55.730 --> 24:57.092
I turned out to be very lucky.

24:57.592 --> 24:59.655
So what were your expectations of the stories?

25:00.857 --> 25:03.660
You know, the honest truth is I'm amazed I sold the book.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.883
It's true.

25:07.545 --> 25:14.794
The way I wrote those stories is right around the time I sold the fourth novel, I got an NEA grant, which just saved my life.

25:14.834 --> 25:15.655
It was so great.

25:15.675 --> 25:21.703
And I realized that if I was really careful, I could probably live for two years anyway for a year.

25:22.392 --> 25:24.876
And that I was never going to have time like this in my life.

25:24.936 --> 25:26.439
Nobody gets that kind of time.

25:26.459 --> 25:28.723
And that I didn't have to churn out another novel.

25:28.783 --> 25:30.967
I didn't have to do something that I had to sell.

25:31.548 --> 25:34.593
I love short stories so much, and I knew I didn't know how to write one.

25:34.694 --> 25:37.138
So it was like my sabbatical.

25:37.158 --> 25:39.021
I said, okay, at least for a year.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.884
I don't care what anybody wants.

25:41.125 --> 25:42.487
I'm just going to write.

25:42.527 --> 25:43.749
There's going to be a training period.

25:43.769 --> 25:46.514
Yeah, I'm going to see if I can teach myself to write a short story.

25:46.594 --> 25:47.556
That's a great story.

25:47.958 --> 25:59.129
I had this idea of her historical novel in mind, so I also wanted to learn to wrestle with historical material, see if I could find some voices and techniques that would let me get into that.

25:59.329 --> 26:02.713
I do want to talk about that, by the way.

26:02.733 --> 26:03.954
But that's all it was.

26:04.174 --> 26:07.938
I mean, I really think of this book as like a laboratory notebook.

26:07.958 --> 26:15.265
It's sort of a record of the experiments that I was making over a couple of years in form and voice and using new contents.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.760
I never set off to make a book.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.945
I was just screwing around.

26:19.965 --> 26:21.468
I was just making some stories.

26:22.050 --> 26:22.831
I mean, not screwing around.

26:22.851 --> 26:25.698
I was working my butt off, but I was doing it for me.

26:26.099 --> 26:29.507
And then the stories led to the novella.

26:29.892 --> 26:32.837
And then, you know, in the bell, it's like, what do you do with it?

26:32.857 --> 26:33.558
Oh, it's everything.

26:33.578 --> 26:33.678
Good.

26:33.738 --> 26:35.161
Can I have some more hot coffee?

26:35.181 --> 26:35.842
Sure.

26:36.503 --> 26:37.184
Oh, it's very good.

26:37.284 --> 26:37.865
I'm sorry.

26:37.905 --> 26:39.948
Yeah, I was just going to say, did you check that?

26:40.289 --> 26:41.992
If you need any more, I'll get you some more.

26:42.212 --> 26:43.274
It's not hot enough.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.077
Let's just see.

26:45.177 --> 26:46.058
I like it hot.

26:46.279 --> 26:53.370
Yeah, well, so do I. That's why I'm out.

26:53.390 --> 26:54.131
It's cold.

26:54.151 --> 26:54.612
Is it all right?

26:54.632 --> 26:55.494
Oh, actually, could you get me some?

26:55.514 --> 26:56.355
Okay, let me see.

26:58.377 --> 27:10.619
So I wrote the novella, and I thought I was going to write a companion novella to go with it, but about a week after I started, I realized I had a huge novel on my hands, and in fact, that's what I'm working on now.

27:11.620 --> 27:15.287
And so then I looked at the novella, and I looked at these stories.

27:16.509 --> 27:21.718
I thought, huh, I didn't really mean to do that, but kind of, sort of, these all seem sort of related.

27:21.968 --> 27:31.480
And there's all these scientists, and what if I wrote maybe one more, and it was another historical one, and then I could sort of do old story, new story, old story, new story.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.202
I mean, contemporary story, history story.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.384
Maybe I could make a little book.

27:35.404 --> 27:41.712
So I made a little book, and I brought it to Wendy, and we both shook our heads and thought, ooh, a book of short stories is really hard to sell.

27:42.073 --> 27:44.556
Ooh, dead scientists.

27:44.856 --> 27:45.557
But Wendy's great.

27:45.577 --> 27:46.939
She says, no, it'll work out.

27:47.019 --> 27:47.880
Somebody will take it.

27:48.821 --> 27:48.921
Yeah.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.244
And we were incredibly lucky.

27:50.324 --> 27:54.230
Carol bought it at Norton, and she did a brilliant job with it.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.874
And I was just really, really, really lucky.

27:56.914 --> 27:58.196
Isn't it amazing, huh?

27:58.216 --> 27:59.238
It is amazing.

27:59.599 --> 28:03.645
So what did you think when you were nominated?

28:04.166 --> 28:05.588
Oh, I didn't even believe that.

28:05.608 --> 28:07.531
I would have to believe that was the biggest surprise.

28:07.611 --> 28:08.352
Oh, absolutely.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.938
I'm sitting at home, scribble, scribble, scribble on the new book, and...

28:12.053 --> 28:17.302
Neil Baldwin, who's delightful, called for the National Book Foundation, which, of course, I had never heard of before.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.165
Isn't this great?

28:19.285 --> 28:21.369
And he says, oh, you know, calling.

28:21.789 --> 28:23.432
He says, you know what the National Book Foundation is?

28:23.492 --> 28:24.694
I said, I'm sorry, I don't.

28:24.714 --> 28:26.177
I was going to ask you for money.

28:26.557 --> 28:28.761
I'm so ignorant.

28:28.781 --> 28:29.803
You know, I don't live in New York.

28:29.863 --> 28:32.307
I'm sort of out of the loop and all this stuff.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.787
He says, so I have this really good name for you.

28:34.807 --> 28:36.810
You've been nominated for a National Book Award.

28:36.830 --> 28:38.632
I said, get out of here.

28:38.672 --> 28:40.374
I thought it was one of my friends giving me shit.

28:40.395 --> 28:42.037
I wouldn't believe him for like ten minutes.

28:42.057 --> 28:43.579
He says, no, really.

28:43.599 --> 28:46.242
I said, who is this lady?

28:46.262 --> 28:50.688
I was very surprised.

28:50.888 --> 28:51.829
I still am surprised.

28:51.849 --> 28:55.354
There were a ton of just incredibly good books last year.

28:55.394 --> 28:58.277
Incredibly good books.

28:58.297 --> 28:58.498
Yeah.

28:58.658 --> 29:01.922
Oh, um...

29:02.695 --> 29:18.299
Again, this was just gossip from New York, but someone at the Barnes & Noble signing who came up with a stack said that she had heard they had found a little pod of returns in the warehouse of the first edition, and Barnes & Noble had gotten hold of those, and so they had this little stack.

29:18.579 --> 29:22.886
Nobody was buying the paperback because they had this little stack of real first editions.

29:22.906 --> 29:24.268
This was at Barnes & Noble?

29:24.288 --> 29:25.109
When was this?

29:25.129 --> 29:25.910
It was Friday night.

29:25.930 --> 29:30.357
It was Barnes & Noble Union Square, and they had, I think, 40 copies, and they just went like...

29:30.775 --> 29:33.838
But not, I mean, not really the people, I think, who wanted to read the book.

29:33.858 --> 29:36.600
It was people who know what you know, collector people.

29:37.722 --> 29:39.844
Were people buying multiple copies?

29:39.964 --> 29:40.644
Boxer.

29:40.664 --> 29:41.345
Those were dealers.

29:41.725 --> 29:42.006
Yeah.

29:43.427 --> 29:45.189
Yeah, I have to assume that.

29:45.249 --> 29:46.149
I mean, I can't.

29:46.189 --> 29:47.431
I'm going to do a little research.

29:47.471 --> 29:50.914
I'm going to find out what your book is going for in the open market.

29:50.934 --> 29:52.135
Oh, I would be glad to know.

29:52.535 --> 29:58.521
And, well, I hope this, you know, I wouldn't talk about this at times.

30:00.712 --> 30:14.355
Yeah, I don't do Internet stuff, but my husband's a big computer jock, and he has a great connection at work because he's got an FGI and all the color things, so we can find it at work if you let us know the site.

30:14.435 --> 30:19.664
Well, it's the New York Times site, www.nytimesnewyorktimes.com.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.848
You get the whole newspaper on the screen.

30:22.970 --> 30:24.012
See, I don't even know about it.

30:24.192 --> 30:24.913
Yeah.

30:25.231 --> 30:32.503
Basically, my research now for my new book is I'm doing so much of it on the Internet.

30:32.523 --> 30:34.406
You can get the San Francisco paper.

30:34.426 --> 30:37.451
I wanted to find out about the San Francisco librarian being fired.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.014
Oh, yeah, that whole story.

30:39.034 --> 30:39.655
And that's a great story.

30:39.675 --> 30:42.279
You must have been doing that whole Nicholson-Baker thing about the books.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.461
That was so fascinating.

30:43.521 --> 30:46.546
I've got a story that's even better than that for my new book.

30:46.567 --> 30:48.690
It's up in your neck, which is Cornell, too.

30:49.953 --> 30:52.376
Well, we'll talk about that later.

30:52.637 --> 31:00.427
I'm doing books of the future and libraries of the future and a canon.

31:00.768 --> 31:02.370
This new book is not about collecting.

31:02.430 --> 31:08.518
It's about people, book places, and book culture on the end of the millennium.

31:08.819 --> 31:12.894
And if we don't get it out in 1999, then it'll be at the dawn.

31:14.038 --> 31:14.539
One or the other.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.928
But that sounds so interesting.

31:17.069 --> 31:19.979
And I'm just interviewing hundreds of people.

31:20.180 --> 31:20.280
Yeah.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.735
But there's also the way that he has gone apart.

31:24.116 --> 31:29.862
Just go visit libraries that have been so significant in history.

31:29.923 --> 31:35.189
Go to Pergamum, which was the arrival to Alexandria.

31:35.209 --> 31:36.811
Go to St.

31:36.871 --> 31:39.254
Gaul, which was the most important, and it's still there.

31:39.834 --> 31:46.082
Monastic scriptorium, or go to Monte Cassino, where the rule of Benedict was.

31:46.122 --> 31:51.128
But explain these things, these places, and go along, and then just bring it up to the immediate present.

31:51.530 --> 32:00.521
you know, the brand-new French Library, the brand-new British Library, and then that would be the continuum, one chapter, and I've done a lot of other things.

32:00.541 --> 32:00.881
It's fun.

32:01.162 --> 32:02.063
That sounds great.

32:02.123 --> 32:03.705
That sounds really interesting.

32:04.205 --> 32:04.746
I'm having fun.

32:04.766 --> 32:09.512
But, you know, you see, every author I've talked to... It changed it.

32:09.572 --> 32:10.373
It saved it.

32:10.393 --> 32:11.234
I start that again.

32:11.274 --> 32:11.774
Reading, what?

32:12.095 --> 32:15.038
No, I mean, reading was just everything to me.

32:15.859 --> 32:18.162
I was such an odd little child, and...

32:18.479 --> 32:20.082
I'm so unhappy in so many ways.

32:20.162 --> 32:21.324
It's just constitutional.

32:21.344 --> 32:23.868
It's not that I had this dire childhood or anything.

32:23.968 --> 32:32.822
But really, since I'm tiny, I've never been really happy unless I was reading or later writing, which is even more of a pleasure than reading.

32:32.942 --> 32:36.848
But books really have been my home in a way.

32:36.868 --> 32:44.200
It's like before the Internet or in the absence of the Internet, I was already wired in the sense

32:45.142 --> 32:49.570
You know that I always lived kind of outside my body when I was doing my truest living.

32:49.650 --> 32:53.817
I do my livest living within the covers of books.

32:53.837 --> 32:56.161
It's just true.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.744
Do you see my eyes sparkling?

32:57.764 --> 33:01.270
No, what a stupid thing that I say.

33:01.431 --> 33:07.842
It's so pathetic, really.

33:08.007 --> 33:09.169
But it is true.

33:09.669 --> 33:11.131
But in a way, I despise it.

33:11.171 --> 33:13.314
I mean, we're not just pure... You despise what?

33:13.695 --> 33:18.141
The fact that so much of the heart of my life is in books.

33:18.702 --> 33:19.763
Why do you despise that?

33:20.184 --> 33:22.046
Well, because, I mean, we have bodies.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.590
We're not just pure spirit and pure mind.

33:24.630 --> 33:27.293
We're incarnated in corporeal things.

33:27.373 --> 33:32.260
We live on the earth, and I've always...

33:32.695 --> 33:35.660
Now that I'm older, I do pay more attention to the outside world.

33:35.720 --> 33:43.873
I mean, I do try and experience things more sensually and remember to look at the sky and remember to feel the weather and remember to look at the ocean.

33:43.953 --> 33:48.340
But my natural instinct is just to float in a sea of words.

33:49.222 --> 33:50.344
It's so home for me.

33:50.364 --> 33:51.786
It's such happiness for me.

33:51.806 --> 33:59.158
And then when I finally did learn to write, and this is another way I realized how incredibly lucky I've been,

33:59.577 --> 34:02.423
A lot of writers actually find writing kind of painful.

34:02.463 --> 34:08.275
They like having written and they like thinking about writing, but for some people it's quite excruciating.

34:08.415 --> 34:10.058
It's amazing to me to find that.

34:10.078 --> 34:16.371
I've interviewed about a thousand authors when I graduated over the last 20 years.

34:17.009 --> 34:19.956
It's amazing to me how many really fun it's to be a painter he has.

34:20.137 --> 34:20.818
I love it.

34:20.838 --> 34:22.843
And to me, it's a great release.

34:22.983 --> 34:24.387
Nazi, yeah, you're the same way.

34:24.407 --> 34:27.173
It's like I sit down and... I love to go for drives.

34:27.193 --> 34:31.544
I love to drive to New York because it allows me for three... I don't have cellular phones or anything like that.

34:31.644 --> 34:33.007
Nobody can bother me.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.090
Nothing to think.

34:34.357 --> 34:35.178
for three hours.

34:35.198 --> 34:38.082
And it's without an interruption.

34:38.102 --> 34:39.424
It's just, it's joyful.

34:39.444 --> 34:40.446
I know, it's heaven.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.028
And that's writing for me, too.

34:42.048 --> 34:43.350
Even if you're not writing, you're writing.

34:43.390 --> 34:47.456
Yeah, I write a lot when I'm not writing, and I'm sure you do, too.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.440
And then when you just sit down, it just comes out, you know.

34:53.064 --> 34:54.045
Where did you get your books?

34:54.746 --> 34:56.909
From the library, or when you were a kid?

34:56.929 --> 34:57.610
From the library.

34:59.092 --> 35:02.938
My family's not bookish, although my mother did read to me.

35:02.958 --> 35:03.739
But, um,

35:04.748 --> 35:11.999
I think they always found my taste for books quite, quite odd, but they were not resolutely against it.

35:12.059 --> 35:13.581
And they would drive me to the library.

35:13.641 --> 35:16.866
Some of the places we lived in, I could walk to a library.

35:16.946 --> 35:21.373
When I was really little, we had a bookmobile, which was fabulous, because it came to me.

35:21.433 --> 35:31.228
And the few places we lived where I couldn't walk or bike, somewhat grudgingly, but pretty much always, somebody would get me down there.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.597
Someone was always pulling me out of the room saying, you know, you've been reading for eight hours, go out.

35:36.158 --> 35:38.061
You're going to hurt yourself, right?

35:38.181 --> 35:41.026
You're going to go blind, you know, why are you so weird?

35:41.046 --> 35:43.850
Go out, you know, play with some friends, go outdoors, do something.

35:43.890 --> 35:46.635
But they always had to force me out.

35:47.717 --> 35:49.740
You have siblings?

35:50.581 --> 35:53.225
I have a kind of complicated family.

35:53.746 --> 35:56.490
Yes, lots of siblings, half-siblings, step-siblings.

35:56.590 --> 36:00.777
Were there other kids reading around you, or were you kind of alone in that regard?

36:02.039 --> 36:07.187
My brother and sister are really bright in other ways, but are not huge readers.

36:07.287 --> 36:09.049
They read a little now.

36:09.130 --> 36:13.196
So there's no explanation for why this happened?

36:13.216 --> 36:15.880
No, no, it's not a book family, and it's not like...

36:15.860 --> 36:18.664
You know, two Harvard professors in a house full of books.

36:18.704 --> 36:20.988
It was a family that was anything but bookish.

36:21.088 --> 36:22.810
Everyone's really active.

36:23.772 --> 36:24.773
They're good with their hands.

36:24.873 --> 36:25.654
They're musical.

36:25.715 --> 36:28.999
My brother is actually much better known than I am.

36:29.019 --> 36:31.984
He's a very well-known stringed instrument maker.

36:32.084 --> 36:33.927
He makes Tucker Barrett.

36:36.671 --> 36:39.895
He makes electronic violins and violas and cellos.

36:41.378 --> 36:44.062
He's based in Vermont.

36:44.082 --> 36:45.023
And my sister...

36:45.340 --> 36:48.783
weaves and does architectural drawings.

36:48.884 --> 36:50.345
Well, they're creative people.

36:50.365 --> 36:54.769
Yeah, it's just not in a booky way, but we all are strange, really.

36:54.829 --> 36:55.730
The creative side of the brain is working.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.551
Yeah.

36:56.571 --> 37:01.936
It's funny, it worked out, and all of us were all self-employed, more or less, and we all sort of make stuff.

37:01.956 --> 37:04.079
We just are working really different mediums.

37:04.659 --> 37:05.140
Funny thing.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.463
If we might, it only gets a little time.

37:08.483 --> 37:09.284
What time is it?

37:09.304 --> 37:10.605
It's a quarter or something.

37:11.260 --> 37:15.765
I saw a quote that these stories are about you.

37:15.785 --> 37:19.990
You're interested in the science of love and the love of science.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.252
Oh, yeah.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.214
But it's an interesting quote.

37:23.935 --> 37:31.464
I'm not necessarily asking you to replicate the quote, but why don't we just talk about the thematic concerns?

37:32.585 --> 37:35.108
I think that partly grew out of the fact that

37:35.611 --> 37:42.999
in the early stages of putting the book together or editing it or starting to make the covers.

37:43.019 --> 37:46.704
Someone was saying, well, how do you think of these stories fitting together?

37:46.824 --> 37:50.288
And I just sort of said that in conversation.

37:53.471 --> 38:02.682
But it was only as we began the process of making the book that really that I even realized that to other people to see scientists as sort of

38:03.421 --> 38:09.592
flawed human creatures with lusts and passions and love affairs and strangeness was odd to them.

38:09.692 --> 38:19.911
I forget because I live with a scientist and all our friends are scientists, that people who aren't scientists, there's that kind of stereotype of scientists that sort of

38:20.077 --> 38:28.193
dry and nerdy and geeky and very technological and not capable of messy human emotions, which of course is just craziness.

38:28.213 --> 38:32.502
They're exactly like you and I. Well, yeah.

38:32.722 --> 38:36.149
But I'm sure even Bill Gates has a seamy side somewhere.

38:36.169 --> 38:36.590
I hope so.

38:37.071 --> 38:38.794
Geez, I do too.

38:39.061 --> 38:42.907
Best not to think about that.

38:43.428 --> 38:52.362
It isn't anything more complicated than that, just the idea that they're as twisted as we are.

38:52.402 --> 38:53.885
They fall in love the same way.

38:54.025 --> 38:58.572
They fall in love or not in love with each other and with their work in the same way.

38:58.822 --> 39:08.733
the one influences the other, that science is really driven by all kinds of passions and jealousies and messy intuitions, and it's not dry.

39:08.953 --> 39:13.478
It is an interesting way to examine human nature, isn't it?

39:13.498 --> 39:14.980
Yes, it is.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.426
Which is why, if I may say, when people used to ask me what I'm writing about, I stopped telling them.

39:20.446 --> 39:22.028
I would say, I mean, I'm book collectors.

39:22.227 --> 39:23.208
Oh, that's interesting.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.450
You know, I would get this vacant look.

39:25.831 --> 39:26.071
Yeah.

39:26.131 --> 39:29.374
And I'm really writing about human nature.

39:29.394 --> 39:31.056
I'm writing about passion.

39:31.116 --> 39:33.238
I'm writing about 2,500 years of obsession.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.260
People who have killed for these things.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.642
People who have been killed for them.

39:36.802 --> 39:38.323
And that's all I was doing, too.

39:38.403 --> 39:44.430
I mean, I think what interests us both, but it's hard to communicate until people read the book.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.393
I'm interested in people who are obsessed.

39:47.833 --> 39:51.677
I mean, you happen to be interested in people who are obsessed by making...

39:51.843 --> 39:54.345
and collecting books and doing certain things with them.

39:54.405 --> 39:58.869
And I'm interested in people who are obsessed with ordering and naming the natural world.

39:58.909 --> 40:03.213
But in both our cases, I would guess that it's the obsession that we're interested in.

40:03.273 --> 40:10.139
I mean, I happen to also love the subject matter, but really it's the obsession with the subject matter that draws me.

40:10.159 --> 40:13.022
And my other books are not about science.

40:13.042 --> 40:15.744
Some of them have a good deal of history and then some don't.

40:15.764 --> 40:21.529
But what I think they do all have in common is they're always full of people who are just weirdly obsessed with

40:22.133 --> 40:28.739
one thing or another, the forms of water, the protagonist is an 80-year-old ex-monk with mad obsessions for other things.

40:29.139 --> 40:33.663
So obsession is something that is a classic.

40:33.683 --> 40:38.247
I'm fascinated by people who get seized by something and can't let go.

40:39.828 --> 40:51.938
The second time I was in graduate school, which I also dropped out, stayed longer that time, but didn't finish, I was doing medieval and reformation theological history, which

40:52.154 --> 41:20.592
I realize on the surface sounds like a long way from zoology and a long way from fiction but but it seems to me now looking back that what was drawing me was the same thing I was the thing I was studying was the early history of the Franciscan order and the split that arose in that order between the people who wanted to stay completely poor and have the monastery own nothing and only have someone else go out and buy the shoes and the bread and only live by begging and and

41:21.044 --> 41:25.710
another wing of the order that wanted to, like, you know, we want a roof and just maybe some bread.

41:25.730 --> 41:29.135
It doesn't have to be good bread, but, you know, we want some bread.

41:29.436 --> 41:32.059
Were they a bookish order?

41:32.079 --> 41:48.722
No, they're not in the way, you know, they actually really turned from that idea, from the really austere bookishness, because, you know, too much money, books need a house, books have to be taken care of, you should be feeding the starving with the money, blah, blah, but...

41:49.006 --> 42:00.237
I'm not religious, it's not that that was drawing me, but the level of obsession and intensity with which those people were approaching those problems was very, very interesting to me.

42:01.518 --> 42:04.681
And I guess that's why I get drawn to so many different fields.

42:05.221 --> 42:08.084
What is it about the power of fiction that attracts you?

42:08.545 --> 42:17.393
I mean, you certainly are writing, you could almost be a, I guess it's the fact that you can work with obsession,

42:17.558 --> 42:38.626
You know, you tell me another field where for one set of three years I can study Arctic exploration in the 19th century, and for another set of three years I can study the history of Darwinian evolution, and for two more years I can study the history of China, and for another couple years I can learn, I did learn a great deal of Benedictine history when I was learning the forms of water.

42:39.026 --> 42:40.548
Where else in the world could I do that?

42:40.668 --> 42:47.177
You know, I have an excuse every couple years to just plunge myself into a whole corner of the world.

42:47.427 --> 42:50.473
and try and inhabit the heads of the people who really do it.

42:50.553 --> 42:54.240
The downside is I have very shallow knowledge.

42:54.741 --> 42:59.691
You'd pull me from this, from the knowledge I get in here.

42:59.711 --> 43:04.520
You're nice to say so, but my knowledge is like this deep, but it's really broad.

43:05.222 --> 43:09.570
I know a tiny bit about a shitload of things.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.157
But I like that.

43:11.177 --> 43:13.120
I mean, I don't advocate that as a way to live.

43:13.300 --> 43:19.309
Actually, my greatest respect really is for people who know a great deal about one or two things.

43:19.329 --> 43:20.330
I love that in people.

43:20.390 --> 43:28.903
I love people who are truly scholars, who truly know something the way you know book collecting, who go all the way down, who really get it, who really dig.

43:28.923 --> 43:32.368
I love those books, but I'm not that way.

43:33.108 --> 43:35.833
I'm really interested in the history of the book.

43:36.434 --> 43:37.716
But I can tell you know this.

43:38.177 --> 43:41.923
I mean, you probably really know the history of the book all the way back.

43:42.004 --> 43:43.246
I don't know anything like that.

43:43.266 --> 43:44.107
No, I'm trying to learn more, though.

43:44.187 --> 43:45.009
You know how you feel?

43:45.470 --> 43:47.854
Somebody said to me, well, you've done this book.

43:47.874 --> 43:49.817
What subject are you going to move to now?

43:49.857 --> 43:50.779
I feel like I...

43:51.367 --> 43:52.831
It took me eight years to do that.

43:52.951 --> 44:01.372
I feel like I've been through medical school and residency and I've performed one operation.

44:01.432 --> 44:03.437
You expect me to quit now?

44:03.758 --> 44:05.663
I'm just starting to learn this stuff.

44:06.014 --> 44:08.338
That's so great.

44:08.358 --> 44:10.703
But I happen to love books, and I love book culture.

44:10.723 --> 44:11.504
I love authors.

44:13.448 --> 44:15.712
You've become one of my authors now.

44:18.477 --> 44:22.605
That's how my book started, interviewing authors and all.

44:22.923 --> 44:29.891
having them inscribe a book for me before we're done.

44:30.812 --> 44:40.283
You work with fictional characters here, invented characters, and also summoned authentic figures from the past.

44:40.303 --> 44:41.945
Do you like to talk a little bit about that?

44:42.025 --> 44:44.848
That's kind of a risky thing to do, isn't it?

44:45.208 --> 44:47.631
I don't think it's so risky the way I do it.

44:47.881 --> 44:55.248
The only time I've really used a historical person as a protagonist is in a story called The English Pupil, which is about Linnaeus.

44:55.308 --> 44:59.873
That was either the first or second story I wrote of this group.

45:00.874 --> 45:05.979
I'm really interested in Linnaeus, and I thought, oh, this is so cool what happened to him.

45:06.259 --> 45:09.523
He named things all his life, and then he lost his mind when he was old.

45:09.583 --> 45:13.346
I wrote that, and it was a really interesting experiment.

45:13.667 --> 45:14.968
I like the story, but...

45:15.522 --> 45:21.988
But I felt very confined working on the story because, you know, there's all the facts of Linnaeus' life.

45:22.028 --> 45:29.676
And because I did do a little history seriously, I'm very uncomfortable with changing known facts and dates and places.

45:30.457 --> 45:36.362
I mean, lots of fiction writers will do that sometimes to wonderful effect, but it makes me queasy so I don't do it.

45:37.804 --> 45:43.269
And after I wrote that, I thought, I really don't want to do that again.

45:43.329 --> 45:45.411
What I want to do is...

45:45.745 --> 46:00.750
And try another tack, which I have been doing quite often since then, where I'll set a historical context really strongly and let real people sort of float through the background, but sometimes they pass very slightly through it.

46:01.068 --> 46:03.391
In Rare Bird, Peter Collinson is mentioned.

46:03.411 --> 46:05.754
I mean, I could write a whole book about Peter Collinson.

46:05.774 --> 46:08.417
So they're really almost as props or as... Almost.

46:08.577 --> 46:12.522
I mean, it cheers me in the writing to pop Peter Collinson in there.

46:12.602 --> 46:13.143
Ambience or whatever.

46:13.203 --> 46:22.595
Yeah, I mean, I know who Peter Collinson is, and I know all about his garden and stuff, and nobody else will, so it's just my personal little jolly, but it makes me happy to put him in the garden.

46:23.296 --> 46:29.303
But if I wrote the story about him, I have to stick to the facts of his life, and as a fiction writer...

46:29.671 --> 46:39.530
I'm happier when I have some room to maneuver to be able to set up a set of events or make an arc of action that's fictionally satisfying.

46:39.570 --> 46:41.854
And it's hard for me to do that with real characters.

46:41.874 --> 46:52.995
So since then, I've always chosen the strategy of having a fictional protagonist and usually fictional people immediately around him or her.

46:53.701 --> 46:56.387
and a fictional situation and kind of wedging that in.

46:56.407 --> 46:59.033
It's like you slot it into the historical record.

46:59.675 --> 47:05.689
Sometimes you can find a space of a year or six months and you can just pop and invent anything in there.

47:07.052 --> 47:10.680
Is this a form of historical fiction in your view?

47:10.795 --> 47:11.496
I don't know.

47:11.516 --> 47:12.938
I'm so unclear what that term means.

47:12.958 --> 47:15.141
I think of it as regular fiction.

47:15.201 --> 47:15.601
I guess so.

47:15.621 --> 47:22.210
I mean, because it certainly has a time and a place that you should be working with.

47:22.230 --> 47:26.495
I don't really think of it as historical fiction, but I suppose that's all I... I didn't either.

47:27.016 --> 47:34.686
I'm just... Somebody said this is a new... One of your reviewers said that.

47:34.706 --> 47:36.108
But you don't think of it in those terms.

47:36.208 --> 47:36.688
I don't.

47:37.129 --> 47:40.313
I think of it as fiction that I just happen to be using...

47:41.086 --> 47:42.588
a different set of facts for.

47:42.628 --> 47:46.634
I did a lot of research for the contemporary novels, too.

47:46.654 --> 47:48.076
It doesn't feel different to me.

47:48.096 --> 47:50.420
It just feels like an outgrowth of the same thing.

47:50.440 --> 47:56.449
Do you have a sense of who the reader is at this point?

47:56.469 --> 47:58.832
This is my biggest puzzlement right now.

47:58.852 --> 48:04.581
I mean, to me, these stories, I had so much fun writing them, but I'm such an odd person.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.043
You're such a what?

48:06.263 --> 48:10.249
I'm such an odd person, and I read such odd things.

48:10.853 --> 48:15.097
I mean, really, I was surprised someone would publish it.

48:15.137 --> 48:19.482
And then when they started to sell it, I thought, well, okay, the reviewers like it.

48:19.502 --> 48:19.922
That's cool.

48:19.942 --> 48:24.167
But reviewers are, you know, usually really smart people and really well-read people.

48:24.227 --> 48:26.209
And I thought, okay, well, they get it.

48:27.110 --> 48:27.931
That's really neat.

48:27.951 --> 48:33.497
But when they started printing the paperback and when the paperback started selling, I'm lost.

48:33.977 --> 48:36.540
I was like, who's reading this?

48:36.960 --> 48:38.802
I'm fascinated.

48:39.018 --> 48:40.720
Yeah, I've been getting mail and stuff.

48:40.740 --> 48:41.741
And how have the signings been?

48:41.761 --> 48:42.382
Have they been good?

48:42.622 --> 48:44.184
Yeah, they have been.

48:44.724 --> 48:46.126
And I'm so flabbergasted.

48:46.146 --> 48:52.152
I mean, I'm happy, I'm thrilled, but it seemed like such a kind of private interest.

48:52.233 --> 48:53.314
It's very startling.

48:53.634 --> 48:55.576
But, I mean, you must feel this about your book, too.

48:55.596 --> 49:05.007
Didn't you ever feel that this was kind of a private passion and that there was a small world of people who might read it, but 50,000 copies tell me you're not surprised to listen.

49:05.147 --> 49:05.587
I'm sure.

49:05.607 --> 49:08.691
I know, I think it's kind of like a... I know, basically, yeah.

49:08.711 --> 49:08.991
Um...

49:09.713 --> 49:10.795
I'll get the years all wrong.

49:10.815 --> 49:11.576
You'll have to check it.

49:11.596 --> 49:17.824
But the big scandal at Union sometime in the last 15 or 20 years, they had one of the elephant folios.

49:18.365 --> 49:19.286
There were five.

49:19.567 --> 49:20.087
Yeah.

49:20.208 --> 49:21.570
They had all five?

49:21.710 --> 49:22.691
They had one.

49:22.711 --> 49:25.455
No, I thought you meant there were five in the country or something.

49:25.475 --> 49:27.217
No, there were five volumes.

49:27.237 --> 49:28.880
I don't think they had all five.

49:28.900 --> 49:31.804
But whatever they had, and it wasn't for them a huge deal.

49:31.824 --> 49:34.908
I guess it's worth like a million dollars or something.

49:35.108 --> 49:37.712
And somebody stole it out of the Union College Library.

49:37.861 --> 49:41.424
No, it was recovered somehow.

49:41.444 --> 49:49.853
I didn't follow this, but I remember it was in the New York Times, and there was all these papers and tracking of the guy, and somehow they got it back, but I can't tell you any details.

49:49.873 --> 49:54.697
What interested me about my guy is that he stole, because he loved the books.

49:54.717 --> 49:56.339
That's what I liked about the story.

49:56.379 --> 49:57.880
He was in love.

49:58.501 --> 50:00.283
He stole them to keep them.

50:00.303 --> 50:04.847
Well, there was a mafia guy that spoke to him.

50:05.198 --> 50:07.869
So you're working on another novel, a novel?

50:07.889 --> 50:08.191
No.

50:08.492 --> 50:13.774
That's the one I thought would be the companion novel, The Ship Fever, and it wasn't.

50:14.260 --> 50:23.290
But it's set just a couple years after the novella, and one of the minor characters in the novella is a minor character in this book.

50:23.310 --> 50:29.277
And it's about a mid-19th century naturalist who's based in Philadelphia on an Arctic exploring expedition.

50:29.638 --> 50:31.740
Do you have a title for it?

50:31.760 --> 50:33.762
At the moment it's called The Voyage of the Narwhal.

50:34.023 --> 50:37.807
How do you spell Narwhal?

50:38.288 --> 50:38.708
N-A-R-W-H-A-L.

50:38.728 --> 50:39.149
W-A-H-L.

50:39.169 --> 50:41.151
No, W-H-A-L.

50:41.171 --> 50:41.451
W-H-A-L.

50:41.471 --> 50:42.192
If you have a...

50:42.172 --> 50:44.335
Projected completion date?

50:45.377 --> 50:49.923
Maybe might finish it this year and forever get home or not.

50:49.943 --> 50:50.865
Okay.

50:50.885 --> 50:54.990
I asked you when you're writing, when you're writing, please yourself.

50:55.311 --> 50:58.455
You don't have any kind of an ideal reader.

51:00.418 --> 51:07.909
No, I write for myself, a little bit for my husband, who's a good reader, and...

51:07.889 --> 51:16.583
Another way that I'm very lucky, I have a very dear writer friend, she's a wonderful writer, lives in an area named Margo Livesey, I don't know if you've

51:16.985 --> 51:17.846
interviewed her.

51:18.587 --> 51:35.607
Anyway, she's terrific, and we've been friends for a long time, and we're sort of writing partners, and she reads all my drafts, and I read all her drafts, and so she's who, when I get sort of enough of a draft of a novel done, I pack it up, and I send it to Margot and say, ooh, what do you think?

51:35.667 --> 51:36.608
What's it going to be?

51:36.809 --> 51:40.593
And she sends hers to me, and we're very lucky to have each other.

51:40.613 --> 51:43.316
So I have this one good reader who helps me a lot.

51:43.337 --> 51:43.877
How do you write?

51:43.897 --> 51:45.439
Do you write on a word processor, or...?

51:45.419 --> 51:45.940
I do know.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.884
I did the first four books in longhand and with a typewriter.

51:49.024 --> 52:06.330
I'd write out a draft in longhand and sort of, you know, make little strings and appendages all over and it would get so messy I couldn't read it and then I'd type it and then I'd start scribbling.

52:06.901 --> 52:13.591
Do you think there's a possibility that the National Book Award had not come along?

52:13.671 --> 52:17.696
Was there a fear that maybe you wouldn't get published at some point down the road?

52:18.117 --> 52:20.160
Yeah, my agent and I talked about it sometimes.

52:20.621 --> 52:21.822
I know this book culture.

52:21.842 --> 52:23.925
I mean, sales and everything.

52:23.945 --> 52:27.490
Even among the University of Fresno.

52:27.591 --> 52:31.316
It's easier if you're a new author.

52:31.336 --> 52:33.179
People want to take a chance on you.

52:33.199 --> 52:35.302
And for a couple books, people will forgive you.

52:35.402 --> 52:35.642
But...

52:35.622 --> 52:40.047
You know, this is my fifth book, and it was going to be my fifth book that didn't sell for Shed.

52:40.387 --> 52:42.089
You'll have to edit that out.

52:42.370 --> 52:47.836
And I do know people now, extremely good writers.

52:48.597 --> 52:54.083
You know, along about the time you get a fifth or sixth or seventh book and you're not selling, people are really tired of you.

52:54.403 --> 52:57.087
They can get all the numbers now from the computers.

52:58.168 --> 53:04.515
And I was used to not making any money from it and making other arrangements.

53:05.170 --> 53:12.879
I was sort of okay with it, but it did occur to me that at some point I'm just going to be so badly poisoned, nobody's going to publish me again.

53:12.979 --> 53:15.682
So there was never a commercial motivation.

53:15.702 --> 53:19.927
And I'm sure that probably continues to be the case.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.048
Regrettably, it's true.

53:21.068 --> 53:22.429
I write because it makes me happy.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.191
Oh, that's Richard Gates, which I love.

53:24.452 --> 53:25.933
He's a wonderful writer.

53:26.154 --> 53:27.015
Oh, God, he's fabulous.

53:27.035 --> 53:27.795
He's fabulous.

53:27.835 --> 53:28.877
Revolutionary wrote.

53:28.897 --> 53:29.237
It's just...

53:29.217 --> 53:30.479
He was great.

53:30.499 --> 53:33.364
He used to hang out at the crossroads in Boston.

53:33.384 --> 53:33.885
Thank you.

53:33.905 --> 53:34.787
Thank you.

53:34.807 --> 53:42.099
And I used to say, actually, once, yeah, because he used to be moan.

53:42.140 --> 53:43.061
Nobody tried to do it.

53:43.161 --> 53:49.913
He said, believe me, if I knew how to write a bestseller, I'd do it in a minute.

53:49.993 --> 53:50.875
Tell me how to do it.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.578
I haven't got a clue what he said.

53:52.598 --> 53:52.778
You know?

53:52.758 --> 53:56.062
You know, if you're not that kind of person, people would say that to me, too.

53:56.082 --> 53:59.786
They'd say, well, why don't you just write one commercial book and you can live off of it?

53:59.806 --> 54:02.269
And it's like, you think I know how?

54:02.289 --> 54:04.111
I have no idea.

54:04.131 --> 54:07.455
I write as well as I can and I put my whole stuff into it.

54:08.136 --> 54:09.538
And that's what I can do.

54:09.618 --> 54:10.859
I can't do anything.

54:11.040 --> 54:14.824
It must be just so gratifying, though, to have this kind of obligation.

54:15.064 --> 54:16.967
I don't know.

54:16.987 --> 54:18.168
It's actually kind of scary.

54:18.448 --> 54:22.393
I mean, it is really gratifying, but...

54:22.542 --> 54:27.890
I still, I wake up every morning and think, oh my God, they made a mistake and they're going to realize it today.

54:28.210 --> 54:31.155
I can't take it back.

54:31.395 --> 54:33.778
Were you surprised when you were named?

54:33.798 --> 54:36.142
I heard that you actually almost fell down.

54:36.162 --> 54:36.623
Yeah, I did.

54:36.683 --> 54:38.445
I spit food across the table.

54:38.525 --> 54:39.307
Come on.

54:39.387 --> 54:40.669
Well, they had, it was so funny.

54:40.869 --> 54:43.433
You know their ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria?

54:43.753 --> 54:44.494
It's so big.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.457
It's the size of a football field.

54:46.437 --> 54:52.546
And when we walked in, I was with Carol, my editor, and my husband, and my agent, and a couple of people from Norton.

54:52.566 --> 54:54.910
And we had physically the last room on the table.

54:54.930 --> 54:56.231
We're like, the back wall's here.

54:56.272 --> 54:57.193
And we're here.

54:57.874 --> 54:59.156
And there's the football field.

54:59.436 --> 55:02.681
And far away, Calvin Trillin's, like, just big.

55:02.701 --> 55:04.143
And we thought, well, that's cool.

55:04.363 --> 55:07.348
You know, the winners should be up near the front where they can get to the stage.

55:07.368 --> 55:08.209
And we looked at the table.

55:08.229 --> 55:09.291
We thought, yeah, we knew that.

55:09.531 --> 55:10.633
And so we'll have a seat dinner.

55:10.693 --> 55:11.113
It'll be good.

55:12.075 --> 55:12.175
Yeah.

55:12.155 --> 55:19.383
So we're eating dinner, and, you know, they do the poetry, and they do the non-fiction, and they do the young people.

55:19.403 --> 55:24.949
And Catherine Harrison got up a little bit, and she said shit fever, and I did.

55:24.969 --> 55:28.573
I spit food, and then it took me like an hour to walk to the stage.

55:28.633 --> 55:31.636
It was just so far away.

55:31.976 --> 55:34.259
And I was so terrified.

55:34.279 --> 55:38.143
She was so gracious to your, to the other nominee.

55:38.163 --> 55:40.025
I wasn't gracious, that was just true.

55:40.045 --> 55:42.027
Those are wonderful books, I mean.

55:42.007 --> 55:43.970
They're wonderful books.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.291
I've known Ron for years.

55:45.391 --> 55:54.704
I think he's an incredibly good writer, and Stephen Milhazer I had never been lucky enough to meet, but I teach his work all the time, and I learn to write in part by reading him.

55:55.505 --> 56:03.255
Of course, I teach very part-time in low-residency MFA programs.

56:03.674 --> 56:07.819
a pretty debilitating fear of public speaking, so I can't really teach in a classroom.

56:07.939 --> 56:08.921
Here you go.

56:09.181 --> 56:10.142
Thank you.

56:10.162 --> 56:11.204
Thank you.

56:11.744 --> 56:12.325
Really?

56:12.345 --> 56:14.948
I've given 36 talks now.

56:15.569 --> 56:15.950
Love that.

56:15.970 --> 56:17.672
This is your first book tour, right?

56:17.692 --> 56:19.354
Yes, my first one ever.

56:19.634 --> 56:23.559
Did you ever think that you'd have a book tour?

56:23.579 --> 56:26.463
No, no, no, no.

56:26.483 --> 56:29.927
I mean, I'm incredibly grateful, of course, for them doing it.

56:29.947 --> 56:31.449
They've done a wonderful job.

56:31.469 --> 56:33.512
It's also very hard for me because...

56:34.505 --> 56:36.689
This is not like a little fear of public speaking.

56:36.709 --> 56:42.578
You know, I've read every night since last Thursday, and it's just really hard for me.

56:42.598 --> 56:43.380
I get really sick.

56:43.540 --> 56:45.864
And what generally do you read?

56:46.204 --> 56:47.426
I've been reading different things.

56:47.446 --> 56:58.825
I read The Literal Zone a couple times, and I read The English People last night, and I've read once a sort of set of excerpts from Ship Fever, which I guess is what I'll do tonight.

56:58.973 --> 57:01.579
So that part's hard.

57:02.521 --> 57:05.949
This part's not, you know, just talking to people one-on-one.

57:06.309 --> 57:06.811
It's great.

57:06.851 --> 57:07.472
I like that.

57:07.512 --> 57:14.608
But since I'm a little girl, having to stand up in front of people and talk is madness.

57:14.969 --> 57:17.775
Have you had pretty good coverage of your whole paper?

57:18.245 --> 57:20.387
There was a lot right after the award.

57:20.447 --> 57:24.372
They were very startled, too, because a lot of people in Rochester didn't even know I rode.

57:24.412 --> 57:28.116
I'm just like the tall lady with the gray hair who walks the dog every day.

57:28.136 --> 57:29.377
Nobody knew what I did.

57:29.398 --> 57:30.379
What kind of dog did that mean?

57:30.399 --> 57:35.284
It's a big pound month, about 90 pounds.

57:35.584 --> 57:44.134
And also, you know, there's that thing that happens in smaller cities where it's hard for them to believe sometimes that

57:44.620 --> 57:48.176
that something good could, you know, nationally good could happen to them.

57:48.196 --> 57:50.165
So they were very surprised as well.

57:50.366 --> 57:53.078
I was just curious because I...
