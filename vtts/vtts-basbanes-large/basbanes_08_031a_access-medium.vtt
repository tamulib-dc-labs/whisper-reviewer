WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:06.722
I'm sorry, because some of this may be stuff we want, talking to William Sapphire.

00:07.923 --> 00:08.944
I'm sorry, you said liberals?

00:09.205 --> 00:12.148
You were just chatting about the various hats that you wear.

00:13.710 --> 00:27.327
Well, liberals like me for my language column, and conservatives like me for my political column, and spooks like my spy novel.

00:27.347 --> 00:29.650
And so I have killed a different audience.

00:30.828 --> 00:34.453
Well, this is now your third novel, I believe.

00:35.796 --> 00:55.966
Well, the last one, Freedom, was, you know, it took me eight years, and it was a great doorstop, as well as a, and it's got good, heavy notes in the back, because I hated the idea of doing a historical novel without knowing what the sources were.

00:55.986 --> 00:56.807
Which is unusual.

00:56.907 --> 00:57.308
I love.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.044
what we call the apparatus of tobacco.

01:00.144 --> 01:03.087
I love to know, and I read notes very, very carefully.

01:03.207 --> 01:09.453
I'm a fan of, my book is, I think, 150 pages of the stuff.

01:09.473 --> 01:12.295
But that was unusual, wasn't it?

01:12.736 --> 01:14.818
You might just expand on that if you would.

01:14.838 --> 01:25.928
Yeah, I think the whole idea of historical novels will be enhanced by leveling with the reader about what's true and what's not.

01:27.308 --> 01:48.180
A newspaper man can't give away his sources for alive and kicking, but a historical novelist can certainly help the reader along and just tell him, I made up this character, or this is absolutely based on such and such a letter.

01:49.181 --> 01:55.611
And there is a class of reader who really digs that.

01:56.806 --> 01:58.468
Herman Wolfe does that, too.

01:58.508 --> 01:59.489
He does, yeah.

02:00.190 --> 02:10.883
Of course, you didn't feel the responsibility of building his back in sleep was spied, because this is largely an invention.

02:11.624 --> 02:16.991
However, you are drawing from inside knowledge, I gather.

02:17.011 --> 02:17.211
Right.

02:18.233 --> 02:25.041
I did have a long session in the 70s with James Jesus Angleton.

02:26.067 --> 02:39.441
the great counter-spot for the CIA, who was fired for being too zealous about keeping out the molds.

02:39.561 --> 02:41.063
You mentioned him on your education.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.364
Right.

02:42.384 --> 02:50.813
And he was an orchid gatherer and raisin.

02:51.614 --> 02:52.835
A orchid gatherer, I'm sorry?

02:52.855 --> 02:54.977
No, he was an orchid cultivator.

02:55.312 --> 03:12.013
Orchids was his horticultural hobby, and I asked him why, and he explained the deceptiveness of orchids, how insects were confused by orchids that dissembled.

03:13.035 --> 03:24.289
And he also told me the story of the fireflies and the assassination beetles, where even insects practiced deception on each other.

03:25.096 --> 03:34.588
That got me into an interest in epistemology, the study of knowledge, and the limitations of knowledge and the intrusions on knowledge of deception.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.313
So this is a novel about deception.

03:38.333 --> 03:38.714
Indeed.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.201
This is the concept of the sleepers.

03:44.321 --> 03:48.066
Oh, let me, before we get into that, I hope you don't mind my jumping around.

03:48.526 --> 03:52.892
I transcribe these tapes and they make sense when I have them.

03:53.632 --> 03:56.996
Were you working on this prior to the arrest of Ames?

03:57.016 --> 03:58.418
Um, let's see.

03:58.498 --> 04:01.622
Because a mole certainly is, we certainly have a mole in here.

04:01.963 --> 04:04.205
I was noodling around the idea of a sleeper.

04:04.506 --> 04:05.747
A sleeper is not a mole.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.269
I understand, but there is also a mole.

04:07.730 --> 04:07.950
Right.

04:08.571 --> 04:10.593
A mole is a second, actually, there are two moles here.

04:11.435 --> 04:18.964
And by the way, Dick Helms told me that, uh,

04:20.328 --> 04:24.653
They never used the word mole back in the 50s and 60s.

04:24.673 --> 04:28.238
They always talked about penetration agents.

04:28.258 --> 04:31.682
And then John Le Carre used the term mole.

04:31.882 --> 04:33.204
Did he invent that word?

04:33.224 --> 04:33.504
Yeah, yeah.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.227
He cooked it up, good figure of speed.

04:36.748 --> 04:41.694
And then the intelligence community seized it, and now it's used.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.416
So life follows art.

04:47.020 --> 04:47.601
But...

04:50.315 --> 05:01.908
The Ames thing came as I was writing this, and certainly had an impact on that about.

05:01.928 --> 05:04.751
It certainly gives a credibility to this whole thing.

05:04.811 --> 05:05.131
Absolutely.

05:05.151 --> 05:07.374
Because maybe Angleton wasn't so crazy.

05:07.634 --> 05:08.835
That was my point.

05:09.956 --> 05:15.002
As Henry Kissinger used to say, even a paranoid has some real enemy.

05:15.202 --> 05:19.647
I forget whether that was, but it used to be paranoid, too, if everybody was out to get you.

05:20.420 --> 05:24.264
Something like that.

05:24.524 --> 05:44.383
But nobody, although he was not very assiduous when it came to the civil liberties of government employees, nobody died on, no American agent died on Angleton's watch as a result of a mole's activity.

05:44.403 --> 05:49.228
So now he's looked back on with a little more respect than he had in two or three years.

05:49.462 --> 05:57.470
Well, there is still, isn't there some speculation that they haven't covered all the penetration agents of the moles?

05:57.710 --> 06:00.012
I think they'll go find another mole before we do.

06:00.032 --> 06:01.193
Yeah.

06:01.213 --> 06:16.128
And, of course, what happens, Chris, and the disinformation concept is wonderful, because even though we have a new government in Russia, these people still have a vested interest, don't they, in protecting sources of information?

06:16.148 --> 06:18.270
They've split their...

06:18.875 --> 06:24.020
KGB into the foreign intelligence branch, which is separate from the KGB now.

06:25.121 --> 06:30.546
And that is actively spying all over the world, particularly here.

06:32.168 --> 06:44.460
And our FBI is tasked to follow them around here and complain of not getting enough money because the Russian effort here is increased.

06:46.634 --> 06:56.826
while the KGB is less effective in Russia, because they've had so many changes at the top.

06:58.548 --> 07:15.308
I did get a chance to go to Lubyanka when I was there a couple times, twice, and visit the prison, or the former prison, and meet the heads as they come and go.

07:15.524 --> 07:19.529
heads as often as they change the name of the book.

07:19.549 --> 07:25.196
But certainly a lot of the verisimilitude was right for my book.

07:25.216 --> 07:27.198
And that's very important to you.

07:27.218 --> 07:34.747
I mean, it goes back to what you were saying earlier about freedom, even though you don't have the textual apparatus at the back of the book.

07:34.767 --> 07:39.973
If you name building, that name, so far as you know, is correct.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.015
Right.

07:41.375 --> 07:45.480
The factual stuff is as factually correct as you can make it.

07:45.764 --> 07:47.726
Is that a fair assumption?

07:47.746 --> 07:49.128
There is one mistake in this book.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.130
Mistake in 10 minutes or?

07:51.591 --> 07:57.738
In my language column, whenever somebody catches me in a mistake, I say, aha, you see, you passed the test.

07:59.620 --> 08:00.761
But this is a real mistake.

08:01.602 --> 08:10.152
I refer to Fort Marcy Park, which is a park overlooking the Potomac.

08:12.055 --> 08:19.503
And it happened to be the park in which Vincent Foster's body was found.

08:19.764 --> 08:19.964
I know.

08:19.984 --> 08:22.567
I used to drive out there when I was a kid.

08:22.587 --> 08:24.669
That's right near the CIA.

08:24.889 --> 08:30.135
That's where you met people when the CIA didn't want you to come in.

08:32.138 --> 08:37.524
They used to provide protection from a naval assault up the Potomac.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.765
Wasn't that the idea?

08:38.785 --> 08:40.527
Wasn't that intended originally?

08:41.097 --> 08:42.158
Yeah.

08:42.238 --> 08:44.922
Fortification guarding Washington from attack.

08:45.503 --> 08:48.426
Guarding Washington from attack by the Confederates.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.329
Right, yeah.

08:52.011 --> 09:09.653
I'm not sure of that, because it was on the Virginia side, and Virginia was... The mistake is I referred to the park being named after McClellan's chief of staff, which is true, Marcy.

09:10.375 --> 09:26.991
who later became his son-in-law, which is also true, but his name is not William Marson, it's Randolph Marson, which I discovered when I drove by there recently and just stopped in.

09:27.031 --> 09:29.133
Did you discover that somebody brought it to your attention?

09:29.193 --> 09:31.575
No, I was passing by.

09:31.635 --> 09:34.378
Is that driving nuts when that happened?

09:34.398 --> 09:35.459
Well, I look at it this way.

09:35.499 --> 09:36.400
It's a book collector.

09:36.920 --> 09:41.425
It means in the next edition, please God, we'll have another printing.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.909
I'll correct it, and that'll make the first edition the real first edition.

09:44.989 --> 09:51.015
My book, if I may digress, has a... Would you like some sparkling water?

09:51.275 --> 09:53.518
I would love some.

09:53.578 --> 09:56.081
Give me a chance to just check.

09:56.101 --> 09:59.865
You go crazy, because I want it to be as right as you can make it.

10:00.065 --> 10:04.750
But that does make an issue point for your book, the fact that you have the

10:05.523 --> 10:08.426
The Christian name of Marcy incorrect in one.

10:08.706 --> 10:09.707
I'm not going to use this advice.

10:10.087 --> 10:10.968
That's all right.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.130
No, I'm not worried about it.

10:13.150 --> 10:21.878
There's a group of people that call themselves the gotcha gang that take a special delight in catching mistakes that I make.

10:22.559 --> 10:23.740
Well, that's... Which is legit.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.482
That's an occupational hazard.

10:25.502 --> 10:25.662
Exactly.

10:25.682 --> 10:26.583
I mean, you run that risk.

10:26.663 --> 10:31.808
And frankly, every time I make a really egregious mistake, it's another column.

10:31.828 --> 10:34.450
Well, have you made many egregious mistakes?

10:34.615 --> 10:35.617
Can I call them?

10:35.637 --> 10:38.361
Yes, but they're all intentional.

10:41.626 --> 10:53.003
There's a great quote that I recall from my undergraduate days back in the 60s, and I don't know the pronouns, but when one thief steals from another, the devil laughs.

10:53.043 --> 10:53.765
Have you heard that?

10:53.785 --> 10:54.646
No, that's a great question.

10:54.706 --> 10:55.768
And I've got to find it.

10:56.028 --> 11:00.555
I'm sure if I go back to my old notebook, so it's a great, great book.

11:00.805 --> 11:04.751
kind of get that sense in here, I mean, disinformation, disinformation.

11:07.415 --> 11:16.347
Well, one of the characters, the KGB chief, says a couple of times in the book, don't trust anything I say.

11:17.149 --> 11:21.134
And, of course, that applies to every character in the book.

11:21.154 --> 11:30.728
And that mirror, I have a scene set in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, which is my big symbol of the world of deception.

11:32.125 --> 11:41.534
Talking generally about journalists and bureaucrats and politicians and Washington, there is.

11:41.554 --> 11:46.038
I wrote my master's thesis years ago.

11:46.118 --> 11:53.344
I had a fellowship in Washington, D.C., and the whole essence was the symbiosis that exists between the case study of the Bobby Baker case.

11:53.505 --> 11:59.550
How could Baker go on all those years when nobody in the press knew what he was doing?

12:00.442 --> 12:03.205
Most money he ever made was $19,000 a year.

12:03.906 --> 12:07.349
As aide to Johnson, he was building this huge million dollar motel.

12:07.850 --> 12:14.497
You know, yet the press knew because they depended on him as a symbiotic relationship that exists.

12:14.517 --> 12:20.123
And I think that you kind of exploit that institution.

12:20.523 --> 12:21.625
Do you see that?

12:21.685 --> 12:23.687
Is that still the case in Washington?

12:23.707 --> 12:28.592
Well, my one page of preachiness in the thing is that where the

12:28.977 --> 12:37.024
world's greatest reporter here, Irving Fine, explains to the young woman reporter, television reporter from Latvia.

12:37.445 --> 12:38.425
Vivica.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.007
No, not Vivica.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.748
This is Liana.

12:41.868 --> 12:43.330
The one from Riga.

12:43.350 --> 12:44.931
Great.

12:44.951 --> 12:49.075
And up at Syracuse, where I... That was my college.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.957
I dropped out of Syracuse.

12:52.738 --> 12:56.722
He explains to her the symbiosis.

12:56.742 --> 12:57.162
And

12:57.597 --> 13:04.604
and yet shows that there's a difference in purpose between the world of intelligence and the world of reporting.

13:04.624 --> 13:15.074
Where intelligence, the end product, is kept secret, and in reporting, it's just the opposite.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.617
One group has a need to know, and the other a need to tell.

13:19.678 --> 13:25.123
And they use each other, and in this interplay, whoever

13:25.913 --> 13:29.556
gets the most use out of the other wins.

13:29.576 --> 13:33.360
So you see it more or less as a contest, as a game.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.301
A cooperative contest, yes.

13:35.742 --> 13:40.006
But you said you used the verb wins so that that suggests that they're playing a game.

13:40.346 --> 13:49.494
On the other hand, do you also see, having been in Washington for many years, that reporters will protect sources?

13:49.514 --> 13:52.057
Just as intelligence agents will protect sources.

13:52.977 --> 13:55.920
Because it's bartering information, bartering papers.

13:56.491 --> 14:14.318
And one of the points I'm making here is that journalists often deceive and use half-truths and make things up in order to get information out of sources.

14:14.338 --> 14:15.239
How do you feel about that?

14:16.421 --> 14:17.723
It's a legitimate technique.

14:17.783 --> 14:24.253
If I say to you, I know that you're going to be 65 tomorrow,

14:25.465 --> 14:29.349
in the hope that you'll tell me that you're only 63 or whatever.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.450
All right.

14:31.331 --> 14:33.314
That gets me the information, and it's a trick.

14:33.574 --> 14:37.198
But I mean, but how about actually using deception in your copy?

14:37.839 --> 14:39.540
No, you don't deceive the reader.

14:39.701 --> 14:40.662
Right, okay.

14:40.682 --> 14:43.685
But in the interchange with the subject?

14:43.705 --> 14:52.975
But in trying to serve the reader by getting him the truth, you often use tricky devices.

14:53.815 --> 14:57.741
But have you ever known it will even use as a trial balloon?

14:57.801 --> 14:58.101
Yes.

14:58.842 --> 15:01.627
How do you feel about that?

15:01.647 --> 15:03.810
If it's an interesting trial balloon, then I kind of like it.

15:04.791 --> 15:09.698
And I identify it as such.

15:10.259 --> 15:10.720
Oh, you do?

15:10.840 --> 15:11.421
Sure, why not?

15:11.922 --> 15:12.883
It doesn't cost anything.

15:14.105 --> 15:20.114
If I say such and such a candidate is thinking of doing such and such, the truth is he is thinking about it.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.337
And if it flies, he'll do it.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.788
If it doesn't fly, it won't.

15:24.609 --> 15:30.939
And that's the trouble with a lot of us, is that we don't... Us being journalists?

15:30.959 --> 15:33.282
Yeah.

15:33.302 --> 15:38.650
We don't label what we're doing.

15:38.851 --> 15:41.314
What I do in my column is commentary.

15:41.535 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, but it is labeled by being on the op-ed page, isn't it?

15:46.010 --> 15:48.913
We have a sense of what it is, obviously.

15:48.933 --> 15:52.137
It's not reporting on the First Lady's speech in Beijing.

15:52.357 --> 15:55.721
I mean, just as an example.

15:55.741 --> 16:00.907
Well, I can get away with murder because everybody knows I'm an opinionated reporter.

16:00.947 --> 16:03.630
I'm sorry.

16:08.896 --> 16:14.262
So just as in my novel I can shape the truth,

16:15.119 --> 16:19.684
I can shape my opinions right in front of everybody.

16:19.704 --> 16:20.305
Are you having fun?

16:20.946 --> 16:21.507
Oh, this is great.

16:21.527 --> 16:22.408
Are you writing novels?

16:22.868 --> 16:24.911
Do you write a language column?

16:26.733 --> 16:28.996
Well, I'm like an air controller.

16:29.016 --> 16:35.163
I have two columns of political columns a week coming in like a shuttle.

16:35.463 --> 16:43.973
And then I have once a week a language column, which I can deliver on a Friday or I can deliver on a Monday.

16:44.134 --> 16:44.434
It's a

16:44.887 --> 16:46.288
It's not as hard a deadline.

16:47.610 --> 16:52.595
The first deadline I've got to be... You mean for this Sunday, your absolute deadline is like yesterday?

16:53.195 --> 16:54.917
No, I'm two weeks ahead.

16:54.937 --> 16:56.378
Two weeks ahead.

16:57.099 --> 17:01.723
So I'm right on tight deadline for my political stuff.

17:02.084 --> 17:02.324
All right.

17:03.365 --> 17:06.368
Five o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, I'll file for a Thursday morning.

17:07.169 --> 17:09.391
That's tight.

17:09.411 --> 17:09.952
Yeah.

17:09.972 --> 17:11.913
And I do that twice a week.

17:11.933 --> 17:13.335
So those are my shuttles.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.556
That's the shuttles coming in.

17:15.008 --> 17:21.135
And then the language column, which is a more relaxed deadline.

17:22.436 --> 17:34.349
And then there's the intercontinental aircraft, which is the novel, or the dictionary, whatever I'm working in.

17:34.550 --> 17:38.574
I have the dictionary as a major reference.

17:38.594 --> 17:41.337
I mean, I have my reference books.

17:42.110 --> 17:47.959
The reference book that I did that surprised the hell out of me was Lend Me Your Ears.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.162
Right, that's right.

17:50.443 --> 17:51.945
That's all 60,000 copies.

17:51.965 --> 17:53.247
It's still going strong.

17:53.828 --> 18:01.259
Because as a factual reference, I mean, just to find out that somebody said something and to get them... In context, yeah.

18:01.319 --> 18:05.085
In context, it's really... I have books.

18:05.326 --> 18:10.834
I want 15,000 books in my house, but there are a few that you have in your body for...

18:11.287 --> 18:13.069
That happens to be one of them.

18:13.109 --> 18:18.917
And that other volume of your essay is over here, and that piece of it.

18:18.937 --> 18:24.484
I also, whenever I go into a new city, I mean, I've said this, I've always looked for the second-hand book stories.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.086
They don't have to be antiquarian books.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.149
I prefer even a second-hand book.

18:28.189 --> 18:36.079
I love getting the book for two bucks that's out of print and nobody wants, and I love those kinds of stories.

18:37.105 --> 18:41.391
I mean, you said you went to Syracuse, you dropped out, and I have the factual background.

18:41.411 --> 18:45.296
That was a pretty good piece in the New York Times Magazine six or seven years ago.

18:45.316 --> 18:48.880
I mean, that's all essentially correct factually, isn't that right?

18:49.221 --> 18:53.306
I'm not going to bother revisiting a lot of these things.

18:53.326 --> 18:58.513
But you never attended, I mean, journalism was not your chosen career, was it?

18:58.693 --> 18:59.414
Yes, it was.

18:59.634 --> 19:05.762
Back when I was 19, I went to work for the Herald Tribune, and it was an adventure.

19:06.265 --> 19:09.468
And then I got drafted, and then I went to public relations and politics.

19:10.890 --> 19:21.020
I didn't expect to go back to journalism, because there are so many, so few really great slots as columnists.

19:21.901 --> 19:24.183
A columnist is the coveted good job.

19:24.203 --> 19:25.284
You know what I'm talking about?

19:26.045 --> 19:28.988
And, I mean, nobody wants to be the top editor anymore.

19:29.008 --> 19:32.952
They want to be a columnist.

19:33.953 --> 19:36.255
But at Syracuse, I dropped out.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.883
When was this, by the way?

19:39.903 --> 19:41.885
1959.

19:42.105 --> 19:44.187
That was the class of 51.

19:44.607 --> 19:45.508
I dropped out of 49.

19:46.810 --> 19:51.554
Came back and gave me the commencement address a couple of times.

19:51.575 --> 19:53.556
And then they made me a trustee.

19:54.758 --> 19:59.242
And then I was able to set up a room at the Syracuse Library.

20:01.124 --> 20:05.989
I got a foundation of which I'm on, the Charles Dana Foundation.

20:06.577 --> 20:12.385
to contribute yearly to the upkeep of a room at the Syracuse Library.

20:14.027 --> 20:23.020
And I've donated a portion of my library, mainly the language stuff, the lexicography.

20:23.040 --> 20:23.280
Your papers?

20:23.300 --> 20:23.961
Not my papers.

20:24.081 --> 20:25.703
These are books I've collected.

20:25.723 --> 20:34.736
You know, old dictionaries and old books about language, philology, you know, going way back.

20:34.756 --> 20:35.757
Boy, I hate to give up.

20:36.040 --> 20:43.006
Well, you know, I haven't given it all up.

20:43.026 --> 20:47.410
I've got a 10,000 volume library at home, and a big house, and I got a lot.

20:47.430 --> 21:03.104
But, so I started out with 1,500 that I gave them, and then I was able to set up a, thanks to Dana, an acquisition fund, a small acquisition fund, so we can buy books for that library.

21:03.124 --> 21:06.047
And what we're going to do is make that room into a,

21:06.719 --> 21:10.984
a good working center for students who are interested in language, too.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.689
And I can go up there every now and then and give a seminar and see my old books.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.290
That's great.

21:17.531 --> 21:27.583
You'll enjoy my book, because this is precisely the kind of thing I write about, books going on as pilgrims, you know, from generation to generation.

21:27.603 --> 21:34.971
Oh, I got a call from Alan Stapak at Second Story Books in Washington.

21:35.407 --> 21:50.743
you know, and rock them, saying an institute of linguistics has decided to get rid of its pre-1984 library, because this is right out of room.

21:51.424 --> 21:55.989
And so he said, I've got 80 cartons of books here.

21:57.470 --> 21:58.171
Come on over.

21:59.312 --> 22:01.735
So I went over, and I picked out 15 cartons,

22:02.153 --> 22:12.663
wonderful, you know, runs of dialect notes and quarterly publications of languages, just impossible to find.

22:13.985 --> 22:18.669
And so I picked out 15 cars and shipped them off to Syracuse.

22:18.689 --> 22:20.611
And that's a good feeling.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.634
And one of these days I'll sit down and, you know, go through them.

22:23.654 --> 22:23.774
Sure.

22:23.834 --> 22:26.597
My passion is books on books, anything.

22:28.219 --> 22:31.722
Bibliography or book collecting or library formations.

22:32.326 --> 22:39.554
But so many of the catalogs now have a special section of books on them.

22:39.574 --> 22:39.835
That's right.

22:39.855 --> 22:40.776
They don't even have sales.

22:41.216 --> 22:45.822
I go to all of them.

22:45.842 --> 22:46.022
I can't.

22:46.042 --> 22:48.445
By the way, it doesn't seem that we're talking about the novel.

22:48.725 --> 22:50.888
That's my job, to read it.

22:51.088 --> 22:56.134
I'm more interested in the creation of the novel.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.276
It's my job to read the book.

22:58.977 --> 22:59.818
I'm not going to ask you questions.

23:00.642 --> 23:02.765
that I'm supposed to answer myself.

23:02.785 --> 23:05.689
I'm not worried about whether or not you're plugged enough.

23:05.709 --> 23:06.971
I'll write something right now.

23:06.991 --> 23:10.255
And I don't know if Tom told you, I do have my own syndicate of newspapers.

23:10.335 --> 23:11.998
Yeah, you told me that.

23:12.038 --> 23:14.020
Which I've put together in the last year and a half.

23:15.142 --> 23:22.852
I've perceived a need for a good literary column, and what I've done is target university towns to play.

23:22.913 --> 23:24.495
So I'm in Lawrence, Kansas.

23:24.515 --> 23:26.177
I'm in Eugene, Oregon every week.

23:26.731 --> 23:27.272
My column.

23:27.492 --> 23:28.955
I'm in Knoxville.

23:28.975 --> 23:29.716
I'm in Austin.

23:30.237 --> 23:31.118
That's a good idea.

23:31.218 --> 23:32.240
I'm in Gainesville.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.425
I went up to the three villes, Charlottesville, Gainesville, and Knoxville.

23:35.465 --> 23:37.348
I got them all three.

23:37.368 --> 23:43.958
And Columbus uses me a couple of times when I'm in Salt Lake City every week, and they all give me nice play, quick window.

23:44.018 --> 23:53.553
And what I do is guarantee them a face-to-face interview every week with a major or interesting author like this.

23:53.573 --> 23:54.595
We could do the first novel.

23:56.903 --> 24:02.929
provide the art, and I shoot some color, if you'll let me when I'm done, because some of these papers like colored pictures.

24:02.949 --> 24:04.050
Boston likes color.

24:04.990 --> 24:07.393
Anyway, that's kind of what I do.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.114
I've got 30 papers.

24:09.134 --> 24:10.075
They take me every week.

24:10.175 --> 24:11.536
About 20 take me every week.

24:11.556 --> 24:14.960
But this piece... So how do you get a prop out of it?

24:14.980 --> 24:15.820
I think it's on tape.

24:16.861 --> 24:18.022
We've got to get some good clothes.

24:18.102 --> 24:19.103
By the way, what's your time?

24:19.143 --> 24:22.647
I've got another guy coming at 11.15.

24:22.747 --> 24:25.189
Okay, we've got to forget some time.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.074
Let's get back.

24:31.094 --> 24:35.121
You mentioned that you were, did you do some PR when you were in the service?

24:35.141 --> 24:38.366
You were drafted, you said, when were you in the Army?

24:38.426 --> 24:43.935
1951 to 53, during the Korea War, I was over in Europe.

24:43.955 --> 24:53.110
And then I came back and I became, after I did a stint as a television producer, a flak.

24:53.130 --> 24:55.294
And I was a press agent for about eight years.

24:55.932 --> 25:00.556
I was a public affairs officer on the aircraft carrier Riskeny for three years.

25:00.576 --> 25:02.878
Well, that's where you learn how to twist minds.

25:03.159 --> 25:06.001
Well, you know, I got a medal.

25:06.121 --> 25:10.025
I made two combat cruises over in 69 and 70.

25:10.385 --> 25:13.608
I mean, you really do learn a few things, don't you?

25:13.628 --> 25:18.032
I mean, you learn that an enemy camp, an enemy village is a camp.

25:18.112 --> 25:19.693
It's never a village.

25:19.713 --> 25:21.615
You know what I'm saying?

25:21.635 --> 25:23.257
We bombed an enemy village.

25:23.297 --> 25:24.758
No, you bombed an enemy camp.

25:25.497 --> 25:27.899
It's a very big difference, isn't it?

25:27.919 --> 25:29.481
You didn't run a trail.

25:29.581 --> 25:32.163
You learned a little about manipulation.

25:32.643 --> 25:35.726
You know, these are things that we learn.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.048
But, you know, I have my experience.

25:38.068 --> 25:40.951
Going back to writing fiction, is this an entertainment?

25:40.971 --> 25:42.232
Is this amusement for you?

25:42.252 --> 25:45.395
Are you trying to be instructive at all?

25:45.495 --> 25:54.643
Well, in two of my novels, in full disclosure here, I draw on my experience as a journalist.

25:55.231 --> 25:58.834
and use it and have fun with it.

25:59.955 --> 26:08.282
In Full Disclosure, which was in the 70s, it was about the president going blind and trying to knock him out of the presidency under the 25th Amendment.

26:08.302 --> 26:12.566
And it was about moral blindness in positions of power.

26:13.387 --> 26:16.209
And so I drew on my White House experience there.

26:17.390 --> 26:22.415
And it was a way of telling the truth, really, without being burdened by facts.

26:23.896 --> 26:24.917
So I had a purpose there.

26:25.707 --> 26:50.837
purpose here, a purpose with freedom, was to explain how the Emancipation Proclamation came about, and to use a fictional method which allows you to get inside the minds of the participants, which you cannot really do as a straight historian.

26:50.857 --> 26:54.381
And in David Donald's new one volume,

26:55.373 --> 26:59.800
biography of Lincoln, the one that's coming out next month.

26:59.980 --> 27:07.673
You know, this is this generation's one-volume Lincoln, replacing B.P.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.033
Thomas'.

27:09.696 --> 27:19.812
In the back, when he gets to the notes about the Emancipation Proclamation, he credits freedom as having an excellent underbook

27:20.095 --> 27:23.779
has all the facts about how it came to be.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.521
Well, how do you feel when you see that?

27:25.541 --> 27:28.324
Damn good.

27:28.564 --> 27:48.145
Now, in this one, people in the world of intelligence, you know, are fascinated by it, with it, because it deals with the philosophy of epistemology, and the

27:48.918 --> 27:51.962
the techniques, the serious techniques of deception.

27:53.483 --> 27:57.568
I know that you know that I know that you know, which means what?

27:58.169 --> 28:00.111
How do you play it at that point?

28:00.131 --> 28:03.656
And you get these grand strategies against each other.

28:04.276 --> 28:08.682
And that's part of their business and part of the way they delight in their business.

28:09.763 --> 28:14.689
And some of the feeling of dismay and horror when it goes wrong.

28:15.563 --> 28:27.938
This premise of the sleeper with this vast fortune to play with, is this totally an invention, or is it something that you suspect may to some lesser degree have actually happened?

28:27.958 --> 28:41.914
Well, we do know that when the Soviet Empire was crumbling, some of the Communists had control of billions of dollars in gold, and it has disappeared.

28:42.395 --> 28:44.878
So it's somewhere, and somebody's doing something with it.

28:45.989 --> 29:08.236
I took the idea of a sleeper agent who was a banker who could do something with it and married that truthful idea of a stake to the fictional fancy that with inside information you could run that stake up pretty high.

29:09.337 --> 29:13.482
And the KGB did indeed have a lot of inside information

29:14.373 --> 29:20.280
Not only about America, but they had inside information about Eastern Europe.

29:21.321 --> 29:23.284
And they could tell you what would happen.

29:23.324 --> 29:27.829
Well, they gave you tomorrow's newspaper today.

29:28.870 --> 29:43.688
And if you have billions of dollars to play with, and you know what horses are going to win, and what currency is going to go up or go down as a result of political unrest, then you can really make fortunes out of it.

29:44.512 --> 29:53.805
So I put the truth together with a speculation, and who knows how much of it is true.

29:53.825 --> 29:57.150
What do your contacts and language tell you about this?

29:57.170 --> 30:07.785
Is it a fanciple premise, or is it something that might have some credibility to it?

30:07.885 --> 30:09.528
They're checking into some of it.

30:09.568 --> 30:10.509
Are they really?

30:10.589 --> 30:11.490
You know, the idea.

30:11.510 --> 30:12.612
The concept.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.827
Where is some of this money?

30:15.789 --> 30:26.081
People in Russia and in Latvia and in Langley are interested in the Russian Mafia.

30:27.182 --> 30:30.466
They're becoming a very powerful political force in their world right now.

30:30.546 --> 30:32.749
Here's an answer to your question.

30:34.211 --> 30:42.801
Two weeks ago, I get a wonderful newsletter from the Jamestown Foundation, which sort of replaced Radio Free Europe in

30:43.473 --> 30:49.660
knowing what's going on inside Russia and inside the former Soviet Republic.

30:49.680 --> 30:56.688
And they said that there had been two bankers a month murdered in Russia for the last two years.

30:57.168 --> 30:57.289
Wow.

30:57.329 --> 31:02.114
They just murdered, and they... That's 48.

31:02.134 --> 31:03.936
That's a lot of bankers, isn't it?

31:03.956 --> 31:05.097
That's not 48, 24.

31:05.358 --> 31:07.260
Times two, right.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.143
So they killed the cream of the bankers.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.906
And why?

31:13.898 --> 31:32.813
because the amalgam of the old underground, the new corrupt apparatchiks, and the new capitalists have gotten together to form an effective mafia.

31:34.075 --> 31:34.636
That's true.

31:35.698 --> 31:37.341
And what do you suppose they call themselves?

31:39.278 --> 31:40.640
The Felix Group.

31:40.940 --> 31:41.842
Isn't that amazing?

31:41.862 --> 31:42.122
Yeah.

31:42.202 --> 31:57.724
Well, it's not really amazing, because... Well, you pick Felix Dzerzhinsky as your patron saint, and so it becomes, I call it the Felix Organization, and they call it the Felix Group.

31:57.744 --> 32:01.028
Sometimes, you know, because you know enough, you can almost... Right.

32:01.048 --> 32:04.153
That's why I've come to the conclusion that I have a great criminal mind.

32:04.553 --> 32:06.596
That's my kicker.

32:06.636 --> 32:08.779
I always need my lead, and I always need my kicker.

32:09.080 --> 32:09.841
to the story.

32:10.221 --> 32:22.635
Being a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, do you find that when you go into your novelist mode that you have a hard time letting your imagination run wild?

32:23.276 --> 32:23.496
No.

32:24.497 --> 32:29.763
The hard time with your imagination comes when you're writing political commentary.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.665
You have to rein it in.

32:32.386 --> 32:33.407
That's the other way with you.

32:33.447 --> 32:35.509
I let things go.

32:36.130 --> 32:40.556
There's a great quote in that Times magazine piece, that profile of you last day.

32:40.577 --> 32:42.059
That was in New York magazine.

32:42.079 --> 32:42.780
Was it New York?

32:42.800 --> 32:44.222
It wasn't the Times.

32:44.242 --> 32:45.904
Okay.

32:45.924 --> 32:50.010
It was something they sent, and I thought it was the Times.

32:50.030 --> 32:50.531
It was New York magazine.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.636
But the quote was, you have the best job in the world.

32:54.096 --> 32:54.877
Do you feel that way?

32:55.278 --> 32:57.041
Oh, absolutely.

32:57.061 --> 33:05.513
I mean, you never could have possibly imagined that at this point in your career, in your life, that you'd be doing all these wonderful things.

33:05.662 --> 33:08.705
Having influence, being a journalist, being a novelist.

33:09.386 --> 33:11.669
Right, and being free.

33:11.689 --> 33:12.370
Key word, right?

33:12.390 --> 33:16.234
Yeah, and that's the, check the opening sentence in this book.

33:16.254 --> 33:16.514
Right.

33:20.159 --> 33:24.423
And it comes out of the title of my Civil War novel.

33:24.564 --> 33:34.555
And that's, freedom is a central thing in my life, both personal and interest in human rights.

33:35.598 --> 33:42.947
How do you see yourself as a writer of political thrillers?

33:43.087 --> 33:51.517
Do you see yourself, do you rank yourself in the pantheon, assuming that Le Carre is on Mount Everest?

33:52.057 --> 33:54.640
I'm not a full-time spine novelist.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.565
This is my first and maybe last spine novel.

33:58.585 --> 33:59.386
Although you never can tell.

34:00.066 --> 34:04.812
But I chose the genre to

34:05.365 --> 34:07.727
served my purpose.

34:07.748 --> 34:08.268
Which was?

34:08.829 --> 34:26.928
To explore the mutual manipulation of spies and reporters, and to study disinformation and deception.

34:26.948 --> 34:31.252
Is it also a comment, a post-Cold War comment in any way?

34:31.272 --> 34:33.955
Obviously it takes place in post-Cold War,

34:35.285 --> 34:46.879
Well, it is a commentary on the interplay of good and evil forces after the evil empire is gone.

34:46.899 --> 34:49.121
Of course, this is a pretty interesting week, isn't it?

34:49.202 --> 34:50.383
Progress reconvenes.

34:51.725 --> 34:55.229
These are exciting times to change hats entirely now.

34:55.849 --> 34:56.070
Right.

34:56.650 --> 35:02.237
And my vacation is over as of tomorrow, and I go back to work.

35:02.740 --> 35:14.474
so that's why I got the papers all here, reading about Bosnia, and I'll pick up the phone and I'll call Holbrook and whoever else and get to work tomorrow.

35:14.894 --> 35:21.963
I also have an interesting year ahead, or nine years ahead on novels.

35:22.403 --> 35:30.773
I'm on the Pulitzer board now, and so I get a chance to read all the novels of the

35:31.141 --> 35:36.888
chosen by the panels for consideration as the Pulitzer Prize novel.

35:36.908 --> 35:38.190
Novels, though?

35:38.210 --> 35:42.596
No, on all categories, novels, poetry, newspaper, everything.

35:42.616 --> 35:47.922
The board is 12 people who vote on the submissions.

35:47.942 --> 35:48.603
That'll be fun.

35:48.623 --> 35:50.826
So now I'm going to start reading a lot more novels.

35:50.866 --> 35:51.988
You get a lot of books, though.

35:52.008 --> 35:54.310
They'll send you a lot of books.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.273
I get a lot of books, anyway.

35:56.293 --> 35:59.477
But now I'll be reading them more closely and purposefully.

36:00.098 --> 36:10.411
Just quickly, Ace McFarland, your big literary agent, are you making any comment on the super-agents that you might know?

36:10.912 --> 36:24.469
Well, there's no doubt anybody who's been to Mort's office knows that I've described Mort's office, but the agent herein is not Mort.

36:25.006 --> 36:29.112
I've heard that you don't hold grudges, I guess, for a particular... There's a statute of limitations.

36:29.132 --> 36:29.432
Yeah.

36:29.452 --> 36:36.663
I remember William Kennedy, when he won for Irony, one of my favorite authors, said he quoted Billy Phelan or Franny Phelan.

36:36.683 --> 36:39.567
He says, I don't hold grudges for five after five years.

36:39.587 --> 36:49.000
But it is kind of amusing to look at that Halberstadt quote when you were first at that position in New York Times.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.964
And he later... Did he recant that?

36:52.325 --> 36:54.608
He sent me a note about that, saying,

36:55.567 --> 36:58.090
I bet he was wrong, and he admitted it.

36:58.111 --> 37:02.777
And you and Kissinger, I understand, are kind of... And Bette Brown, yeah.

37:02.797 --> 37:03.498
Oh, yeah.

37:03.718 --> 37:06.282
Henry and I buried the hatchet ten years ago.

37:06.302 --> 37:07.103
So, life goes on.

37:07.584 --> 37:12.951
And Bert Lance, whenever he comes up to Washington, I got my Pulitzer on his back.

37:13.912 --> 37:17.237
But you also had the decency to pull back the...

37:18.905 --> 37:20.327
Yeah, I hate to say the dogs.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.370
Well, I kick them when they're up.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.391
It's important, isn't it?

37:24.812 --> 37:26.574
Yeah, a very important distinction.

37:26.594 --> 37:31.259
I think, and you also said that writing three columns a week is not a full-time job.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.141
That's true.

37:33.161 --> 37:36.545
And is that, can you just, what do you do for the rest of the week?

37:36.565 --> 37:38.247
I mean, it's seen.

37:38.327 --> 37:42.272
Man, my kids are out of the house, right?

37:42.292 --> 37:47.578
The dogs take up a certain amount of time, but you can write while you're walking then, right?

37:48.503 --> 37:51.546
Would you like me to send you a copy of my piece to your office or wherever?

37:51.566 --> 37:52.287
Gee, that'd be great.

37:52.347 --> 37:53.828
I'd be pleased to do that.

37:54.008 --> 37:56.390
And I'm just going to, do you mind if I also take a couple of shots?

37:56.731 --> 37:57.592
What was that we were just saying?

37:57.612 --> 38:00.654
You shot that famous picture in Moscow, right?

38:00.895 --> 38:14.508
Right, of Nixon putting his finger in the chest of Khrushchev and saying, your children will live in freedom.

38:14.528 --> 38:17.110
When Khrushchev said, your children will

38:17.714 --> 38:21.299
You know who won that one, huh?

38:21.319 --> 38:21.499
Right.

38:23.522 --> 38:35.517
Well, the KGB won the espionage war, but we won the Cold War.

38:35.537 --> 38:44.790
One more, and I'll be out of here.

38:44.810 --> 38:45.190
One more.

38:48.258 --> 38:53.097
Well, you're a one-man band.

38:53.217 --> 38:54.683
It's great to see you.

38:54.703 --> 38:55.004
Amazing.

38:55.065 --> 38:58.217
At my age to be doing this stuff.
