WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.516
Okay, we're taping.

00:03.839 --> 00:10.029
You have to appreciate that I just got the material by FedEx about 45 minutes ago.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.133
Well, I hope you've read the book by now.

00:12.874 --> 00:15.899
What did you think, Nick?

00:15.919 --> 00:21.769
Well, I'm enjoying my preparation, let's put it that way.

00:22.643 --> 00:24.686
I hope they explain to you what I'm doing.

00:24.726 --> 00:30.496
As I understand it, you're doing an article on fashion.

00:30.916 --> 00:34.863
Well, this publication in the Hamptons, Hamptons Magazine.

00:35.123 --> 00:36.926
Right, I know it.

00:37.046 --> 00:39.610
All right, so I'm writing book features for them this summer.

00:40.231 --> 00:40.912
Oh, great.

00:40.932 --> 00:43.176
And they're doing a special issue on fashion.

00:44.558 --> 00:45.119
Right.

00:46.141 --> 00:49.326
Are you doing the Calvin Klein Obsession book?

00:49.306 --> 00:51.590
I don't know what they're doing, to tell you the truth.

00:52.491 --> 01:00.685
They asked me if I could come up with something on fashion, and so I checked my sources and came up with this book.

01:00.886 --> 01:04.893
I doubt if they're doing Calvin Klein, to be truthful with you.

01:05.173 --> 01:10.442
I don't know much about the magazine, but I suspect that that Calvin Klein book is probably pretty negative.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.407
Whoa.

01:13.387 --> 01:17.593
That's a pretty interesting guess on my part.

01:17.633 --> 01:25.585
So what they do, I haven't really seen many copies of the magazine, but I suspect that that's not the kind of thing they want to do.

01:25.645 --> 01:26.106
No, you'd be surprised.

01:26.126 --> 01:28.289
I think they cover anything that's hot.

01:28.309 --> 01:30.552
Okay, well, I... I mean, I know...

01:30.532 --> 01:35.957
I know you're recording this, so I don't like to say that they like to do puff pieces.

01:35.977 --> 01:36.597
Don't worry about it.

01:36.677 --> 01:37.598
These tapes are strictly mine.

01:37.658 --> 01:38.239
I'm in magazine.

01:38.259 --> 01:39.139
I think you're wonderful.

01:39.219 --> 01:40.300
I always like your covers.

01:40.400 --> 01:40.921
They're nice.

01:40.961 --> 01:41.401
They're cool.

01:41.421 --> 01:43.503
Olivia, these tapes never go anywhere.

01:43.843 --> 01:44.604
I know, I know.

01:46.526 --> 01:47.567
I don't want them to go.

01:47.587 --> 01:50.609
And I've never, let me say, I've never been, let me say, I have never.

01:50.649 --> 01:52.230
Would you say she dared to say that?

01:52.291 --> 01:53.532
Well, let's pan the book.

01:53.672 --> 01:54.673
No, no, no, no.

01:54.693 --> 01:57.935
I'm writing the piece, and it's not a review, so help me here.

01:58.055 --> 01:59.897
Tell me a little bit about it.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.825
the Zen approach to fashion.

02:03.026 --> 02:05.671
All right, let's start with... I mean, you've done two other books.

02:05.892 --> 02:11.724
They have been... All right, well, let's... What we need is some nice, good, cute, quotable quotes, okay?

02:11.744 --> 02:12.746
That's my job.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.527
Okay.

02:13.547 --> 02:16.333
A few sound bites, even if you're not... Well, we are doing...

02:16.313 --> 02:17.396
These are sound bites.

02:17.416 --> 02:18.900
This is how we're going to write this piece.

02:18.920 --> 02:19.601
That's right.

02:19.621 --> 02:20.123
That's right.

02:20.403 --> 02:20.764
Okay.

02:20.825 --> 02:23.231
First of all, I mean, just for background, okay?

02:23.251 --> 02:23.592
Okay.

02:24.273 --> 02:26.660
My first book was First Wives Club.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.802
I know the other books.

02:27.863 --> 02:28.625
Okay.

02:28.645 --> 02:28.885
Right.

02:28.905 --> 02:31.191
It's the world of society women.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.314
Unfortunately, they're

02:32.294 --> 02:38.645
dumped by their husbands when they're too old to be, you know, a trophy wife.

02:38.985 --> 02:41.690
I'm happily married to my first wife, by the way.

02:41.790 --> 02:42.171
Excuse me?

02:42.772 --> 02:44.675
I'm happily married to my first wife.

02:45.095 --> 02:46.578
Hey, you're my kind of guy.

02:46.878 --> 02:52.087
I wish I could say I'm happily married to my first husband, but I was the first wife.

02:52.207 --> 02:52.869
I got dumped.

02:53.470 --> 02:53.790
Wow.

02:54.051 --> 02:58.538
So, anyway, the second book was...

02:58.518 --> 03:26.517
about how Hollywood sort of dumps women, makes them the flavor of the month, which was the title, and how women are controlled sort of by the media and how we worship the, what shall I say, the pictures that are put before us, the images that Hollywood and television, that the magazines build for us.

03:26.817 --> 03:31.186
that have very little to do with reality and how it affects women's everyday life.

03:32.449 --> 03:42.430
The main character of the book is a talented actress who gets an Obie Award for her play, but when they take the play to Hollywood,

03:42.983 --> 03:50.512
The point being, when they take the play to Hollywood, it's a middle-aged, dumpy woman's part, and they cast it with a Michelle Pfeiffer type.

03:51.132 --> 04:00.503
So she can't win, and she decides to have $67,000 worth of plastic surgery and moves to Hollywood and becomes the flavor of the month.

04:01.564 --> 04:09.133
So I'm interested in the way that women cope with the demands that society puts on them.

04:09.213 --> 04:12.417
And fashion is very interesting because...

04:12.937 --> 04:28.821
The way people in Overeaters Anonymous say, you know, our addiction is tougher than alcoholism because with alcoholism you can just stop drinking.

04:29.382 --> 04:32.066
But with food you have to eat every day.

04:32.847 --> 04:40.378
Well, what I'm interested in about fashion and clothes with women is women have to get dressed every day.

04:40.932 --> 04:44.035
And for a lot of women, it becomes an obsession.

04:45.276 --> 04:47.799
This doesn't apply to men, does it?

04:48.219 --> 04:49.260
This is strictly women?

04:50.041 --> 05:03.574
Well, I think that they're, in fact, that this is spreading, just like you didn't used to hear about bulimic men, you know, or men who had plastic surgery a generation ago.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.717
You know, now it's happening.

05:05.757 --> 05:10.281
So this stuff does move on down, but it seems to be women at the...

05:10.582 --> 05:13.909
what shall I say, the forefront of the disease.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.893
So you are calling it a disease.

05:16.455 --> 05:18.740
An addiction, shall we say.

05:19.120 --> 05:25.975
I'll tell you, you can quote me on that, but what I did in the book is I tried to differentiate between two...

05:26.343 --> 05:27.785
Two approaches.

05:28.266 --> 05:35.696
There's the positive part of fashion, which is people want to express how they feel about themselves in the way that they look.

05:36.316 --> 05:39.260
And there's a sensuousness to it, and it's fun.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.263
You know, it can be amusing.

05:41.564 --> 05:44.908
I like clothes that have a little humor to them, an edge.

05:45.789 --> 05:50.375
And there's also the very negative side.

05:51.877 --> 05:53.099
I am what I wear.

05:53.359 --> 05:54.561
I am how I look.

05:55.030 --> 05:57.213
This is what I am, and there's nothing more.

05:58.094 --> 06:00.497
And if only I had the right blazer.

06:00.737 --> 06:03.441
I spoke to a woman who said, here's a soundbite for you.

06:03.901 --> 06:07.726
She said she had 16 navy blue blazers.

06:08.247 --> 06:10.089
I mean, I don't know how many other clothes she had.

06:10.149 --> 06:10.830
She had loads.

06:10.890 --> 06:19.361
She said, I have 16 navy blue blazers because, you know, you can never have enough blue blazers.

06:20.722 --> 06:22.384
Now, I mean, I'm not making that up.

06:22.885 --> 06:22.945
No.

06:23.330 --> 06:24.892
And I was shopping.

06:25.653 --> 06:31.780
I used to go to the malls and to department stores, and I would watch women shop.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.265
And they go into, many times, they go into a sort of a daze.

06:40.350 --> 06:43.413
It's almost as if a spell falls over them.

06:43.433 --> 06:50.822
And the ones that fascinated me most, I used to go early, were the ones waiting outside the door.

06:50.988 --> 06:52.110
at 10 a.m.

06:52.210 --> 07:00.446
for the doors to open, sort of like drunks in a bar on 2nd Avenue at 9 in the morning.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.169
You know what I'm talking about?

07:02.189 --> 07:02.269
Yep.

07:03.712 --> 07:04.674
They needed their fix.

07:05.115 --> 07:07.038
They were desperate for their fix.

07:07.058 --> 07:12.709
So let's talk, so you came to, now this is your third book of what, three years?

07:13.162 --> 07:15.524
Well, almost.

07:15.844 --> 07:20.308
Actually, I started writing for Slides Club in 89.

07:20.448 --> 07:20.749
I see.

07:20.949 --> 07:22.090
It didn't come out until 90.

07:22.190 --> 07:22.490
Right.

07:22.830 --> 07:29.116
So you really did want something to fit into the scheme of the two earlier books, right?

07:29.416 --> 07:35.682
Well, I think people write out of their obsessions, to tell you the truth, or most people, most writers.

07:35.982 --> 07:41.667
And this, not fashion per se, but this idea of,

07:42.052 --> 08:01.917
women and their perception of themselves and the way they are um uh manipulated to perceive themselves fascinated me it's just i i don't seem to get tired of how did you start with a story with the concept you're going to do the fashion industry so how did you tell me what you did gee let's see how did it start um

08:02.622 --> 08:04.524
I mean, I know something about the story.

08:04.564 --> 08:06.827
I've had a little time to get to familiarize myself with it.

08:06.847 --> 08:08.849
Yeah, well, you know it's called Fashionably Lady.

08:08.870 --> 08:12.214
Yeah, I've got this stuff, and I even know what Karen is doing.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.738
She's 40, and she's reaching a crisis.

08:16.278 --> 08:23.227
You know, I can't... I can clearly tell you what started me on the first two books.

08:23.547 --> 08:29.254
I'm not sure if I had, like, an epiphany moment...

08:30.635 --> 08:32.197
Oh, wait, wait.

08:32.397 --> 08:32.798
Okay.

08:32.918 --> 08:36.283
Well, this is kind of, this is pretty neurotic.

08:38.987 --> 08:41.130
But okay, I mean, what the hell?

08:41.150 --> 08:43.173
I'll tell you when we go off the record.

08:43.273 --> 08:43.874
How's that?

08:43.894 --> 08:44.094
Sure.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.596
But you can use this, I guess.

08:45.636 --> 08:49.361
I mean, it's demented, but it's no worse than most people, I don't think.

08:49.682 --> 08:59.916
I got my charge card bill one month, and it was for an incredible amount of money.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.391
And I thought there must be a mistake.

09:04.472 --> 09:09.319
And I looked at the charge card, and I went through all the charges, and they were mine.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.320
They were.

09:10.661 --> 09:11.041
They were.

09:11.261 --> 09:12.503
Yeah.

09:12.523 --> 09:15.127
And, I mean, it was multiple thousands of dollars.

09:15.207 --> 09:20.614
That's not, not only is that not my, I mean, I was a starving writer for nine years.

09:20.674 --> 09:24.840
Believe me, this was not my, you know, modus operandi.

09:25.529 --> 09:27.271
And I stopped and I said, what happened?

09:27.431 --> 09:29.053
What happened last month?

09:29.633 --> 09:31.395
I mean, not only that, what did I buy?

09:31.455 --> 09:35.460
And why is it that when I go to the closet I never have anything to wear?

09:35.520 --> 09:40.465
And most other women I know feel the same, but I really spent a lot.

09:40.485 --> 09:41.286
What happened?

09:42.167 --> 09:50.676
And I went back and I looked and found that my new book had come out.

09:51.010 --> 09:54.775
I was doing these interviews.

09:54.815 --> 09:56.097
There was a lot of stress.

09:57.539 --> 10:01.405
And it wasn't that I went out and shopped to get something to wear to do an interview.

10:01.425 --> 10:02.947
It wasn't that.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.571
It was just, oh, I got over that.

10:05.711 --> 10:08.095
Or, oh, I have to get over the next one.

10:08.395 --> 10:09.657
And so I went out and bought things.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.923
And, I mean, this isn't anything new.

10:13.943 --> 10:19.431
But when it happened to me, and I think I'm kind of aware of my behavior, you know, I...

10:19.630 --> 10:22.661
I took a look at that bill and I said, wait a second, wait a second.

10:23.204 --> 10:27.821
Wasn't I good enough in the other black slacks that I had?

10:28.082 --> 10:31.294
I'm going to have to go and buy three more pairs.

10:31.932 --> 10:32.393
I'm sorry.

10:32.713 --> 10:34.455
Yeah, what's going on?

10:34.995 --> 10:36.437
So we have the impetus here.

10:36.898 --> 10:40.462
How do you get authenticity now?

10:40.482 --> 10:53.416
Oh, well, when I wrote about New York society women, they said she's obviously one of these society wives who's been dumped.

10:53.817 --> 10:57.541
Then I wrote about Hollywood, and they said, oh, she's a Hollywood insider.

10:58.582 --> 10:58.682
Yeah.

10:59.202 --> 11:06.630
Now I'm hoping, I suppose they may say, oh, she's been in the fashion world.

11:07.212 --> 11:09.039
I do good research.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.123
So tell me a little bit about it.

11:10.306 --> 11:11.287
I do good research.

11:11.327 --> 11:17.176
I'm a pretty good observer of people, and I'm a very good listener, a good listener and a good looker.

11:17.276 --> 11:23.505
I'm not really a good looker, if you take it the other way.

11:23.565 --> 11:24.927
Tell me about the research.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.289
Tell me what you did.

11:26.309 --> 11:29.974
Well, I spoke to a lot of people, particularly the underlings.

11:30.135 --> 11:33.259
I kept away from any of the...

11:33.745 --> 11:45.983
you know, the Jeffrey Dean levels, the Bill Blass levels of people, partly because I didn't want to be sued by anyone, partly because I felt like

11:46.283 --> 11:51.649
You really get the inside poop when you talk to the guys who carry their bags.

11:53.411 --> 11:58.696
Plus, you knew that you were doing something less than positive about the industry.

11:58.716 --> 12:02.400
Well, I can't say that it's totally less than positive.

12:02.681 --> 12:11.190
My character is a designer, and she represents, I think, the creative part, the positive part of fashion.

12:11.730 --> 12:16.155
She wants to find elegant solutions to...

12:16.439 --> 12:18.562
the design and the living problem.

12:19.183 --> 12:34.586
Clothes that make women feel good, that are comfortable, that look nice on them, you know, and she herself is, you know, approaching middle age and she has thighs and she's never going to be a petite, slim, you know, perfect body.

12:35.287 --> 12:41.856
And so she knows the problems that women want to conceal and what they don't want to reveal and what they do want to reveal.

12:42.377 --> 12:45.822
So to me, she's a very positive character.

12:46.004 --> 12:59.688
Unfortunately, she's spent so much of her life on fashion and on developing this business that other parts of her life are very incomplete, including the fact that she can't conceive a child.

13:00.449 --> 13:05.177
Actually, the original title of the book was Designer Jeans.

13:05.579 --> 13:06.641
G-E-N-E-N.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.885
I was just going to say, how do you spell jeans?

13:08.905 --> 13:09.025
Yeah.

13:09.627 --> 13:14.315
So, you know, I mean, she's got the labels.

13:14.576 --> 13:15.959
She's got the designer labels.

13:16.059 --> 13:18.603
She doesn't have the designer jeans, if you know what I mean.

13:19.064 --> 13:28.482
Is this a, obviously, this is not a sympathetic look at the industry, but by the same token, it's not necessarily a...

13:29.052 --> 13:31.437
I mean, you don't savage the industry either, do you?

13:31.457 --> 13:35.265
Yeah, I don't think it's a saving put-down.

13:36.648 --> 13:41.037
But there's an awful lot that's very easy to skewer, that's very funny.

13:41.959 --> 13:46.588
I mean, I don't know if you get a chance to read my other books.

13:46.957 --> 13:48.799
I'd be happy to send you a couple of copies.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.442
I mean, they're fun, because they're funny.

13:52.604 --> 13:54.165
Hollywood, that was easy.

13:54.346 --> 13:56.228
New York Society, that was a cinch.

13:56.909 --> 13:58.631
Fashion, oh my goodness.

13:58.811 --> 14:03.637
I mean, there were so many... You know, I like to... I try to be funny.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.580
I like to write funny books, and I think it's very funny.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.402
Who do you see as your readers?

14:08.422 --> 14:09.984
At the same time, very sad.

14:10.485 --> 14:15.090
You know, there's a scene when the...

14:15.762 --> 14:28.097
the designer, her name is Karen, has hired her daughter's, her niece, her daughter's daughter, I mean her sister's daughter, to work for the summer as an intern.

14:28.918 --> 14:37.529
And the girl can't make friends with the other models because they feel like, you know, she's, it's nepotism and they're resentful.

14:38.190 --> 14:45.499
And so she finally offers to share her sandwich with another one of the models.

14:45.800 --> 14:56.321
And the woman looks at her, the girl looks at her and says, you know, no thanks, you don't have to share your fat with me.

14:56.482 --> 14:57.163
Oh, great.

14:57.183 --> 15:06.542
And she looks at the sandwich and the little teenager says, but it's, you know, diet bread and it's fat-free mayonnaise.

15:06.893 --> 15:14.660
And the model says to her, it's about the only fat-free thing you've got, honey, and gets up and walks away.

15:14.680 --> 15:24.569
So the 16-year-old begins vomiting her lunch every day until she becomes, guess what, the new waif.

15:26.111 --> 15:29.914
And she's rewarded for this aberrant behavior.

15:30.014 --> 15:30.975
Well, that's nothing new.

15:31.856 --> 15:32.937
Who are your readers?

15:32.997 --> 15:36.040
Who do you perceive as the people you're writing for?

15:36.982 --> 15:41.409
Oh, you know, I get a lot of letters.

15:41.790 --> 15:54.230
And I have to say, I'd like to say sort of the hip, you know, working woman who's trying to have it all and is smart enough to know you can't.

15:55.171 --> 15:58.737
You know, I'd like to say that that's, you know, that's the crowd.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.532
You are writing mostly for women, you would acknowledge.

16:03.473 --> 16:06.937
Yeah, I think men read the books, but I think they're a little guilty about it.

16:06.997 --> 16:08.879
I get less mail from them.

16:10.501 --> 16:26.158
One of my favorite readers is a woman who wrote to me from San Francisco, who's a 66-year-old grandmother, who said she was reading the book on the San Francisco trolley and laughing out loud.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.685
And she said it made her look like she was loony.

16:30.566 --> 16:34.953
And there's a lot of the F words in the book.

16:35.213 --> 16:40.421
So I was delighted to hear from this grandma who said she's giving it to her granddaughter as a handbook.

16:42.745 --> 16:43.546
So I think that's nice.

16:44.768 --> 16:45.930
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

16:46.671 --> 16:48.734
A little biographical background, if you could.

16:50.016 --> 16:51.218
I was...

16:51.552 --> 17:00.943
In the corporate world for 12 years, working as a consultant in marketing, mostly for computer companies, but not always.

17:01.364 --> 17:02.985
Consulting in what, generally?

17:03.746 --> 17:04.788
Consulting in marketing.

17:04.908 --> 17:05.168
I see.

17:05.188 --> 17:08.372
I'm sorry you said that.

17:08.392 --> 17:10.234
Go ahead.

17:10.254 --> 17:14.419
And I came to hate the corporate environment so much.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.041
I mean, it was unbearable.

17:16.982 --> 17:17.863
And...

17:18.586 --> 17:27.379
I don't like the sort of male-dominated corporate mentality.

17:28.621 --> 17:32.546
And I thought, well... This is in New York, by the way?

17:33.508 --> 17:33.688
Mm-hmm.

17:33.708 --> 17:33.868
Yes.

17:34.128 --> 17:35.811
I'm a native New Yorker.

17:35.831 --> 17:36.832
So I had enough money.

17:37.233 --> 17:39.476
By the way, I spent the summers in the Hamptons.

17:39.496 --> 17:40.578
Good.

17:40.698 --> 17:41.840
That helps.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.641
Yeah, well, it's true.

17:43.041 --> 17:44.784
I had a house in Amagansett.

17:45.545 --> 17:47.648
And then...

17:47.982 --> 17:52.643
When I quit, I just had enough money to get along for a while.

17:52.823 --> 17:53.707
And when was this?

17:53.788 --> 17:54.451
When did you quit?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.705
Oh, God, 85.

17:58.057 --> 18:01.580
1985, and I gave myself three years to get published.

18:01.921 --> 18:05.964
So you'd been thinking all along, you know, I'd like to write.

18:06.505 --> 18:10.148
I'd like to say that, but I don't think I had the courage to even say that.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.671
It was just that, you know, business went right.

18:13.691 --> 18:16.975
I had some bonus money put away, and I thought it's now or never.

18:17.835 --> 18:26.123
You know, I mean, so my sister had a big estate in East Hampton,

18:26.440 --> 18:30.506
actually right off of Egypt Lane.

18:31.447 --> 18:32.949
I don't want to say the street.

18:32.969 --> 18:34.171
No, no, please don't.

18:34.191 --> 18:35.473
But right off of Egypt Lane.

18:35.934 --> 18:39.659
Do you want to give me her name, or does he rather not?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.483
No, because then they'll come find her.

18:42.503 --> 18:43.825
Okay, fine.

18:44.746 --> 18:53.038
And what was really nice was she gave me the guest house, and I rode out there.

18:53.423 --> 18:57.470
It got pretty cold after about November, since the house wasn't really heated.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.055
I came back to the city.

19:00.075 --> 19:05.686
But I spent two summers out there writing, and it was a nice time.

19:05.786 --> 19:09.974
This is like 86, 87, 85, 86?

19:09.994 --> 19:15.043
86, summer of 86, summer of 87, yes.

19:15.378 --> 19:18.202
So when did you sell the first book?

19:19.124 --> 19:20.185
It took a long time.

19:20.686 --> 19:24.932
The first book didn't sell.

19:25.193 --> 19:38.112
In 1989, I read this awful article in Fortune magazine about how the new thing was for major corporate executives to trade in their old wives for trophy models.

19:38.581 --> 19:41.473
And it just got me so enraged that I started right away.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.260
I started working on First Wives Club.

19:44.204 --> 19:48.300
And the truth is, really, that that sold to the movies.

19:48.401 --> 19:49.485
It sold to Paramount.

19:49.769 --> 19:51.872
before it was sold to a publisher.

19:52.092 --> 19:52.713
No kidding.

19:53.094 --> 19:53.594
Yeah.

19:53.614 --> 19:54.716
So I sent it in.

19:54.996 --> 19:59.122
I sent it in and gotten three rejection slips when Paramount bought it.

19:59.182 --> 20:05.791
And then all three of those publishers called back and said, you know, we think we'd like to reconsider.

20:06.352 --> 20:07.374
Wonderful how that works.

20:07.954 --> 20:08.856
Did you have an agent for that?

20:08.876 --> 20:09.276
It was nice.

20:09.316 --> 20:10.278
It was nice to find.

20:10.378 --> 20:12.441
I don't know, Nick, if you've ever had that experience.

20:12.461 --> 20:16.266
But it was nice to finally get to say, man, man, man, man, man.

20:16.246 --> 20:18.208
I didn't give it to any of them.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.630
Did you have an agent to help you with this?

20:21.311 --> 20:22.432
Yes.

20:22.452 --> 20:23.513
By then I had an agent.

20:23.693 --> 20:25.355
For First Wise Club.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.716
They like to come.

20:26.776 --> 20:31.521
They did send me a little brochure, The Zen Approach to Fashion.

20:31.541 --> 20:33.003
Now that's not from the book itself.

20:33.043 --> 20:34.904
That's this little thing that you wrote.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.186
No, no.

20:36.206 --> 20:45.595
That was because I learned so much talking to stylists and talking to photographers and talking to...

20:45.845 --> 20:51.511
fashion writers and some of the buyers, I thought it would be fun.

20:51.591 --> 20:54.855
They asked me, why don't you put together a little promotional piece?

20:54.875 --> 21:02.923
So really I put together kind of in five, ten pages everything I learned about how to dress.

21:03.924 --> 21:13.995
Not that I'm any fabulous fashion find, but what I'm saying is that

21:14.549 --> 21:23.139
I mean, why I called it the Zen approach to fashion is that I think women need fewer rather than more clothes.

21:24.680 --> 21:31.528
These quotes that you have here from Coco Chanel and Halston, are they in the book or are these things... No, no, they're just a myth.

21:31.648 --> 21:35.212
Are these things that you found during your research, though?

21:35.252 --> 21:42.160
Oh, yeah, I read about every... I don't think it was a designer's life that I left unstudied.

21:42.861 --> 21:44.202
I'm a big research nut.

21:45.008 --> 21:49.154
And do you mention actual people in the book?

21:49.435 --> 21:50.276
Oh, sure.

21:50.657 --> 21:51.618
Oh, sure.

21:52.580 --> 21:56.425
Karen, my main character, worships Chanel.

21:57.407 --> 22:03.917
She sees, you know, obviously Chanel's been dead for a long time, but she sees Coco as her sort of role model.

22:04.137 --> 22:12.670
And when she was a kid, the rich, drunk old lady down the way used to give her cast-off Chanel

22:13.122 --> 22:23.595
So, you know, it was Chanel who showed her that there was something that she could be.

22:23.835 --> 22:28.841
She didn't know there was such a thing as a fashion designer.

22:29.522 --> 22:34.007
And so throughout the book, we make a lot of references to Chanel.

22:34.308 --> 22:42.117
Do you feel that this is an accurate portrayal of the New York fashion industry?

22:43.008 --> 22:46.171
I think so.

22:46.712 --> 22:48.173
I'm trying.

22:48.233 --> 22:55.620
What you find is there's not a lot of glamour to the business of it.

22:56.161 --> 22:59.964
Karen is working really, really hard.

23:00.765 --> 23:12.897
Unfortunately, she's at that point in her success where because it's a numbers business, she needs an enormous amount of capital

23:13.332 --> 23:19.139
to ship the stuff out the door and get it there in time to the stores.

23:20.100 --> 23:27.209
So she's actually working harder than ever and on the verge of either enormous success or enormous failure.

23:28.911 --> 23:29.472
I'm sorry, go ahead.

23:29.732 --> 23:40.285
Well, I think that is the hard work of it and the difficulties of it are very, very realistic and I think that

23:40.771 --> 23:46.597
the glitz and the glamour that people need to impose on it to make it fun.

23:46.617 --> 23:48.138
I mean, here's a good quote.

23:48.479 --> 23:52.483
You take a look at what the fashion designers themselves look like.

23:54.004 --> 24:09.900
They're not particularly attractive people, and because of that, they need to surround themselves with beautiful models, male and female, to make themselves look glamorous.

24:10.387 --> 24:12.730
and their clothes look palatable.

24:14.091 --> 24:16.334
Of course, they set the fashion, too.

24:17.535 --> 24:31.290
They absolutely set the fashion, but if we looked at Gianfranco Ferre and said, well, here he is in one of his suits, people would run screaming from the room.

24:31.310 --> 24:35.635
He's maybe 150 pounds overweight.

24:35.695 --> 24:36.816
He's a great designer.

24:37.538 --> 24:39.801
But do you understand what I'm saying?

24:39.822 --> 24:40.082
Sure.

24:40.102 --> 24:40.422
Oh, absolutely.

24:40.442 --> 24:41.224
The glamour.

24:42.365 --> 24:46.932
One of my characters says, you know, this business isn't about glamour.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.815
It's about a sausage production.

24:49.757 --> 24:50.538
What was that word again?

24:50.558 --> 24:51.600
You have to get the design.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.643
You have to get it into production.

24:53.683 --> 24:55.085
You have to get it delivered.

24:55.566 --> 24:56.928
You hope you get it sold.

24:56.968 --> 25:03.478
And then you have to collect your money and be on to the next season's designs while you're doing all of that.

25:04.758 --> 25:12.172
So I wanted to show the pressure, and the pressure has worn Karen down.

25:12.352 --> 25:17.201
Like all working women, this is where we go move into universality.

25:18.643 --> 25:26.698
It's worn her down, Nick, and here she is over 40, a good career.

25:27.522 --> 25:31.268
And no child and no real family to show for it.

25:31.689 --> 25:37.859
I mean, she has a marriage, and she's very dependent on her marriage, but even that is threatened by her business.

25:37.879 --> 25:40.904
Are there any parallels from your own life in any of these books?

25:42.728 --> 25:50.200
People ask me that, and I think, you know, I'm definitely like some of my characters.

25:50.981 --> 25:53.125
There's no doubt about it, but...

25:53.307 --> 25:57.976
The things that happen to them are not things that have happened to me.

25:58.617 --> 26:08.857
I mean, I'm hitting 40 and I'm childless, so in that sense I'm like Karen.

26:09.879 --> 26:13.365
You know, I have my biological clock ticking very loudly.

26:14.608 --> 26:14.708
Yeah.

26:15.110 --> 26:24.760
And I know what it's like to try and have a career and a marriage and a home life all at one time and also try and look halfway decent, you know.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.242
Not so easy.

26:27.583 --> 26:37.514
But, you know, oh, did my husband ever buy my company stock out from under me and sell me to the highest bidder?

26:37.594 --> 26:38.295
No, you know.

26:38.875 --> 26:43.260
Stuff that happens, I mean, I've never worked in the fashion business, you know.

26:44.050 --> 26:50.218
I have bought more than my share of blazers, but not 20 navy blue ones.

26:50.238 --> 26:51.159
I can promise you that.

26:51.179 --> 26:56.545
Now, again, you can be sure I'll read your book before I get this thing written.

26:56.846 --> 27:03.674
Do you kind of share that the readers say that Judith Krantz does?

27:03.694 --> 27:05.076
Now, she did something, obviously.

27:05.116 --> 27:07.679
She had scruples there one year, which was a fashion book.

27:07.699 --> 27:10.362
That kind of comes to mind.

27:11.050 --> 27:17.059
Did you search for, let's say, that's the same reader, the Judith Krantz reader?

27:17.079 --> 27:19.002
Just describe your fiction.

27:19.022 --> 27:23.068
Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm very proud of this quote, but it's, you know.

27:24.390 --> 27:27.074
Would you please not say that I quoted it?

27:27.475 --> 27:28.256
Sure, that's fine.

27:28.276 --> 27:30.199
Okay, because it's in that little handout.

27:30.239 --> 27:31.381
Somebody said this.

27:31.401 --> 27:39.353
Entertainment Weekly said this about, because people have compared me to, what's her name, Danielle Steele, and to...

27:39.704 --> 27:42.414
And I don't like them.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.341
You know, comparisons are odious.

27:44.361 --> 27:50.524
But here is what they said, that I wield a pen...

27:50.825 --> 27:59.301
far sharper, far wittier, and far hipper than those of her older sisters, Judith Kranz and Jackie Collins.

27:59.321 --> 28:01.324
Well, that must make you feel pretty good.

28:01.645 --> 28:04.670
Well, I memorized that.

28:04.690 --> 28:07.776
Please don't write that, because it sounds so conceited.

28:07.796 --> 28:13.727
But I worked very hard, because I just felt like most of those women's books were stupid.

28:14.062 --> 28:34.720
They bored me, and I think that there's a lot of intelligent women who like a good read that's funny, but that's contemporary, that isn't about some perfectly beautiful woman whose name is Tiffany, who has, I don't know, sable hair and silver eyes.

28:34.941 --> 28:36.102
They never have normal color.

28:36.342 --> 28:42.027
They never have brown hair and brown eyes, and they never have names like Jane or Karen.

28:42.580 --> 28:57.863
And I just wanted to do like a normal woman who has kind of thick thighs but a good sense of humor and a creative drive and, you know, someone you'd like to be friends with, someone you might know, someone you might be friends with right now.

28:58.944 --> 29:02.049
What's the first printing on the book?

29:02.509 --> 29:03.651
Gee, $150,000.

29:03.671 --> 29:05.734
Oh, that's terrific.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.837
Well, let's hope they sell.

29:07.977 --> 29:09.139
Do you have an option on this one?

29:09.960 --> 29:10.521
Not yet.

29:10.902 --> 29:11.102
No.

29:11.470 --> 29:16.883
But you know who's interested?

29:17.264 --> 29:20.632
Tell me, tell me.

29:20.972 --> 29:22.536
But I don't want to screw up the deal here.

29:24.741 --> 29:25.463
Bette Midler.

29:25.814 --> 29:26.715
Well, that'd be great.

29:26.735 --> 29:28.037
Yeah, Bette Midler is dying.

29:28.117 --> 29:30.220
Well, you know, she's a wisecracking New York girl.

29:30.440 --> 29:30.581
Uh-huh.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.483
But now, don't put this in, okay?

29:32.523 --> 29:33.144
This part?

29:33.164 --> 29:33.605
No, I don't.

29:33.645 --> 29:34.206
You promise?

29:34.306 --> 29:34.887
I promise.

29:35.207 --> 29:35.608
Okay.

29:37.190 --> 29:42.077
My lawyer said, yeah, she went to hell in a handbasket for the boys.

29:42.397 --> 29:45.442
You don't want her touching this thing.

29:45.462 --> 29:47.244
Anyway, she's with Disney, and they're very cheap.

29:47.304 --> 29:48.466
Don't put that in either.

29:48.486 --> 29:48.966
Don't worry.

29:49.207 --> 29:52.952
But, you know, she's looking for a vehicle, and I could see her doing it.

29:53.540 --> 29:58.246
Let's see if we can get some, is it a New York story?

29:58.727 --> 29:59.768
Oh, very much.

30:00.449 --> 30:02.672
It's 7th Avenue.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.235
It's the Gorman Center.

30:04.255 --> 30:07.379
I mean, she goes to Paris, her big triumph.

30:07.399 --> 30:14.328
I mean, her whole life she dreamed that she'd have a show, you know, a fashion show during Fashion Week in Paris.

30:14.989 --> 30:17.893
And sort of the high point of the book is when

30:18.430 --> 30:21.295
She finally takes her collection to Paris.

30:21.316 --> 30:30.052
She's afraid it's going to fail, and she brings it to Paris, sort of a reverse thing, and gets to conquer the city that Coco conquered.

30:30.192 --> 30:37.987
So you must have had a pretty good sense that you knew the 7th Avenue life, culture.

30:38.068 --> 30:38.869
I'm sorry that I...

30:39.423 --> 30:41.026
I had a pretty good sense of what?

30:41.046 --> 30:47.877
I had a pretty good sense of 7th Avenue life and culture before you started.

30:47.897 --> 30:51.744
Well, I mean, as I said, I've lived in New York all my life.

30:51.944 --> 30:52.786
It's hard to avoid.

30:52.806 --> 30:55.610
Hey, I used to shop wholesale on 7th Avenue, you know?

30:55.630 --> 30:56.131
What do you think?

30:56.752 --> 31:01.140
I'll quote the Woody Allen line, the only sin in my religion was to buy retail.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.806
So, you know, I...

31:05.107 --> 31:15.043
Yeah, I think it's hard to live in New York without knowing some Garmentos, and I was fascinated by them, you know?

31:15.564 --> 31:22.876
I mean, writers, you know, we spend, people think, oh, they say to you, I'm sure they say to you, you're a writer, how fascinating.

31:23.437 --> 31:29.106
Well, we spend our lives alone in rooms with, you know, pads of paper or laptops, and

31:29.525 --> 31:31.868
Tell me what's fascinating about that.

31:32.929 --> 31:35.532
If you're lucky, you come out with a book that's fascinating.

31:36.012 --> 31:40.777
What kind of a response do you expect, say, from people in the fashion business?

31:41.658 --> 31:43.140
It's going to be interesting.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.701
It's going to be interesting.

31:45.082 --> 31:52.630
Most of the people that I spoke to talked off the record and didn't want an acknowledgement.

31:53.437 --> 31:56.461
Some people did.

31:56.801 --> 31:58.023
Some people acknowledged.

31:58.884 --> 32:02.909
And other people mentioned in the book as a sort of hat tip.

32:04.851 --> 32:06.674
But it's going to be very interesting to see.

32:09.137 --> 32:09.838
I don't know.

32:09.858 --> 32:10.759
I don't know.

32:10.779 --> 32:20.671
I mean, I got way over 500 letters from first wives who said, yeah, that was my life except mine was worse.

32:21.372 --> 32:21.452
Hmm.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.393
and I never expected that.

32:25.696 --> 32:48.874
I did a lot of research with actresses when I did Flavor of the Month, and although I got some flack from producers who said, you make it all sound much worse than it is, I think that women in Hollywood have by and large...

32:49.799 --> 32:51.101
validated the book.

32:51.962 --> 32:52.884
So I'll see.

32:53.044 --> 32:53.705
I mean, I don't know.

32:53.765 --> 33:04.882
John Fairchild can raise up on his back legs and say, in the worst piece of trash ever put out, doesn't understand, doesn't know, indicts us unfairly.

33:05.022 --> 33:05.422
I don't know.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.066
I don't know.

33:08.086 --> 33:11.451
I guess we'll know in about a month's time, won't we?

33:11.471 --> 33:13.174
Well, is it an indictment?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.321
I don't think so.

33:16.122 --> 33:18.985
I think it's a pretty well-balanced view.

33:19.405 --> 33:38.044
I think what I'm indicting is the fact that, once again, not the creative people who are out there envisioning a look and then creating it.

33:38.064 --> 33:40.086
I think those guys are okay.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.368
It's the...

33:43.141 --> 33:55.879
you know, marketing of this that becomes such a huge, you know, it's a 52 billion, I hope you heard the beat, billion dollar industry a year.

33:57.241 --> 33:57.641
Big time.

33:57.701 --> 34:04.691
And so if I buy, if you buy a navy blue blazer, you know, how long are you going to keep wearing it?

34:04.711 --> 34:10.079
I don't hear you.

34:10.099 --> 34:11.781
No, I'm just, it's interesting.

34:13.027 --> 34:17.773
Well, listen, I don't want to build up your phone bill too high here.

34:17.793 --> 34:25.022
I will read the book, and I'm certainly looking forward to writing this piece.

34:25.563 --> 34:33.433
Did I give you enough... Yeah, I'm looking for... I'm just... Again, I wish I had a better idea of what the other stories in this issue were like.

34:33.473 --> 34:34.234
You know what it's like.

34:34.254 --> 34:36.317
You're trying to...

34:36.601 --> 34:40.207
visualize this article in its context.

34:40.768 --> 34:41.730
Right.

34:41.990 --> 34:52.829
I really think it's safe to say that it's going to raise the hackles, may well raise the hackles of some designers in the industry.

34:52.849 --> 34:53.490
Well, that's good.

34:53.851 --> 35:02.305
Yeah, I think so, and that it'll be controversial, without doubt, and that it covers all of the obsession and compulsion of

35:02.285 --> 35:19.652
of, you know, shopping, shoplifting, the, you know, anorexia and bulimia of the fashion world, but it also...

35:20.307 --> 35:27.118
covers kind of the joy of self-expression and the fun and sensuality.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.903
You know, women can't keep out of the stores.

35:30.584 --> 35:31.185
Why not?

35:31.786 --> 35:41.703
Because there's something very thrilling, you know, about the touch of a sensuous fabric.

35:42.024 --> 35:42.805
And do you get that?

35:43.326 --> 35:44.347
Oh, absolutely.

35:44.988 --> 35:45.910
Absolutely.

35:46.193 --> 35:54.004
I mean, I... So the kicker here is you haven't cured yourself of this particular affliction, have you?

35:54.025 --> 35:55.069
Oh, I don't think so.

35:55.450 --> 35:56.153
But, you know...

35:56.673 --> 36:00.000
I might wind up having my clothes tax deductible.

36:01.182 --> 36:02.385
Isn't that enviable?

36:02.946 --> 36:04.970
Yeah, that's great.

36:05.592 --> 36:06.854
We'll have to see.

36:07.075 --> 36:08.397
You publish that in the IRS.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.201
It'll probably be down on my head.

36:10.221 --> 36:14.089
But hey, maybe they will be.

36:14.129 --> 36:15.793
Now, what's the status of the movies now?

36:15.813 --> 36:16.875
The First Wives Club?

36:17.412 --> 36:21.119
First Lives Club is being produced by Scott Rudin at Paramount.

36:21.139 --> 36:21.980
How do you spell his name?

36:23.763 --> 36:24.244
S-C-O-T-T.

36:24.264 --> 36:25.286
No, I got the Scott.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.510
Yeah, R-U-D-I-N.

36:27.530 --> 36:27.871
Okay.

36:27.891 --> 36:32.138
He's the guy who did Adam's Family Values and The Firm.

36:32.158 --> 36:33.841
Oh, that's good.

36:33.861 --> 36:34.843
What talent do they have?

36:34.863 --> 36:35.364
What people?

36:36.566 --> 36:37.628
I'm sorry?

36:37.688 --> 36:38.510
What actors?

36:39.131 --> 36:39.792
Well, I...

36:40.683 --> 36:43.908
I'll tell you who they're talking to.

36:44.008 --> 36:46.031
I can't tell you anything more.

36:46.271 --> 36:48.875
Okay, so it's not really in production just yet, then?

36:48.935 --> 36:50.217
No, no, no.

36:50.457 --> 36:57.066
They've got a script, and right now, let's see, they're talking about Diane Keaton for one lead.

36:57.146 --> 37:05.478
It's three women, Diane Keaton, possibly Kathy Bates, and possibly, oh, what's her name?

37:06.380 --> 37:06.640
Oh.

37:06.822 --> 37:07.744
It doesn't matter.

37:07.785 --> 37:12.838
The daughter of the, what's his name, Ford, John Houston.

37:13.079 --> 37:14.503
Oh, Angelica Houston.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.528
Angelica Houston.

37:16.762 --> 37:17.903
That was the last I heard.

37:18.244 --> 37:22.149
You know, Nick, I have to tell you, the writer is the last to know.

37:22.169 --> 37:22.610
Oh, yeah.

37:22.690 --> 37:23.571
They don't care.

37:23.871 --> 37:25.093
Well, it's property.

37:26.194 --> 37:27.977
Scott Rudin doesn't return my call.

37:28.858 --> 37:34.505
I asked George Higgins once if he liked the movie about the Friends of Eddie Coyle, and he said, hey, the check cleared the bank.

37:34.946 --> 37:35.707
Exactly.

37:35.727 --> 37:36.868
I mean, that's how you have to do it.

37:36.908 --> 37:37.970
I'll tell you what I said.

37:39.592 --> 37:43.697
When I spoke with Sherry Lansing, who bought the book, you know, she did...

37:43.981 --> 37:45.886
fatal attraction and all of that.

37:45.966 --> 37:47.390
She's the boss now at Paramount.

37:47.771 --> 37:54.148
She bought the book and I said, Sherry, I just want you to promise that you won't change the end.

37:55.191 --> 37:59.222
And she said, Olivia, you're putting your baby up for adoption.

37:59.708 --> 38:03.555
Once it's mine, we'll put it in any school we want to.

38:03.675 --> 38:04.356
I like that.

38:04.617 --> 38:05.098
That's good.

38:05.418 --> 38:06.079
That's excellent.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.161
And that's the truth, too.

38:07.242 --> 38:07.782
Yeah.

38:07.883 --> 38:10.127
And you have to accept that, too.

38:10.307 --> 38:12.331
I was going to say, you can't have it both ways.

38:12.351 --> 38:14.735
You put the kid up for adoption, it gets adopted.

38:14.755 --> 38:15.236
There you go.

38:15.637 --> 38:18.482
You know, if it's raised a Catholic, that's the way it goes.

38:19.704 --> 38:21.447
So, I mean, I can live with that.

38:21.629 --> 38:23.151
Well, listen, I'm going to let you go.

38:23.171 --> 38:27.396
I'll come up with something I'm sure that's good.

38:27.916 --> 38:30.159
Okay, and let me give you one more phone number.

38:30.239 --> 38:30.619
Okay.

38:30.699 --> 38:39.469
Just in case if you have any trouble or if they don't send, we had your publisher's address and everything to send the photo and the rest of it.

38:39.489 --> 38:39.730
Right.

38:39.750 --> 38:45.917
But if you need any background information or any of my clippings and reviews, did you get any of that stuff?

38:45.977 --> 38:46.037
No.

38:46.097 --> 38:49.280
In fact, I'd like to get some of that stuff overnight if I could.

38:49.581 --> 38:50.742
Why is she so stupid?

38:50.722 --> 38:51.824
That's all right.

38:51.964 --> 38:54.008
I've got some stuff here to start with.

38:54.028 --> 38:54.329
Don't forget.

38:54.349 --> 38:55.811
We're just putting this thing together quickly.

38:55.831 --> 38:56.793
Here's somebody smart.

38:57.194 --> 38:57.594
Okay.

38:57.855 --> 38:59.758
Her name is Nancy Robinson.

39:00.139 --> 39:00.560
Nancy Robinson.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.365
And her phone number, she's actually not too far from you.

39:03.725 --> 39:03.826
Okay.

39:03.846 --> 39:06.571
She's my secretary, and she's at 802.

39:08.815 --> 39:10.638
Her home is 885.

39:10.678 --> 39:11.480
Hold on.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.882
885.

39:13.047 --> 39:13.789
4718.

39:15.233 --> 39:16.638
But what time is it there now?

39:16.658 --> 39:17.721
It's about 2 o'clock.

39:18.202 --> 39:21.111
If you call her right now, she's probably at my office.

39:21.131 --> 39:22.415
Okay, the area code is 802?

39:22.776 --> 39:23.017
Right.

39:23.277 --> 39:23.538
Okay.

39:23.598 --> 39:25.584
Right now, she's probably at my office, which is 802.

39:26.206 --> 39:26.567
Mm-hmm.

39:26.918 --> 39:27.579
885.

39:27.779 --> 39:30.842
I'm sorry, you said 885.

39:32.283 --> 39:32.984
Do that once more.

39:33.224 --> 39:35.846
I'm sorry, it's 802-875-4645.

39:35.866 --> 39:39.570
4645.

39:40.030 --> 39:43.433
Right, and today is Thursday, right?

39:43.473 --> 39:43.593
Yep.

39:44.074 --> 39:46.496
So she's there usually until 3 o'clock on Thursdays.

39:46.876 --> 39:50.840
If you call her now and say you'd like some past reviews and stuff.

39:50.860 --> 39:51.420
Clips.

39:51.881 --> 39:52.942
She can't send you any.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.383
The book is not out yet.

39:54.423 --> 39:55.064
I've got the book.

39:55.104 --> 39:56.385
I've got the book.

39:56.365 --> 40:00.051
I've got a reader's edition.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.536
But maybe she could fax me some things.

40:03.017 --> 40:03.357
Okay.

40:03.457 --> 40:07.404
Well, she can fax it or she can FedEx it, whatever's going to be faster.

40:07.444 --> 40:10.049
Whatever she can do is fine.

40:10.169 --> 40:10.970
You can call her.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.114
At her home, she has a machine.

40:13.194 --> 40:16.500
In my office, I don't have a machine, but I have my faxed.

40:16.480 --> 40:24.190
So you can call her and you can just tell her exactly what you want, past reviews, past articles.

40:24.210 --> 40:27.955
Some articles would be good, just to see what we've got.

40:28.435 --> 40:30.278
Well, listen, thank you so much for your time.

40:30.318 --> 40:31.079
I'm going to let you go.

40:31.099 --> 40:31.880
My pleasure.

40:32.200 --> 40:39.349
Hey, listen, if they do print 150,000 of these, and they seem to be, and it goes up to the list,

40:39.329 --> 40:41.014
Keep a hold of that reader's copy.

40:41.034 --> 40:42.438
Apparently they get valuable.

40:42.900 --> 40:43.722
I just wrote a book.

40:44.425 --> 40:47.474
My book will be published by Holt early next year.

40:48.316 --> 40:50.503
It's on the passion for books.

40:50.838 --> 40:54.425
So I know a little bit about these things.

40:54.505 --> 40:55.527
Fiction or not?

40:55.768 --> 40:57.391
It's nonfiction, actually.

40:57.491 --> 40:58.633
Is that right?

40:58.834 --> 40:59.074
Yeah.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.338
Oh, yeah.

41:02.681 --> 41:04.665
I'll show you mine if you'll show me yours.

41:04.685 --> 41:04.965
Sure.

41:05.507 --> 41:06.108
Okay.

41:06.368 --> 41:10.416
As soon as I get a hardcover, I know Paul took your address.

41:10.683 --> 41:12.891
I'll send you a copy.

41:13.433 --> 41:16.102
I'll send you a copy of my last book.

41:16.122 --> 41:18.028
Sounds great.

41:18.189 --> 41:20.457
I mean, I'm a book lover from way back.

41:20.637 --> 41:21.962
That's the title of my book.

41:21.982 --> 41:23.427
I'm going to shut off the tape record here.

41:24.723 --> 41:30.373
My worst nightmare is to be at an airport or on a holiday without a book to read.

41:30.393 --> 41:31.535
I'd hate that.

41:32.297 --> 41:36.825
And I collect books like a maniac, and now I have money to do it.

41:36.925 --> 41:37.686
Oh, isn't that nice?

41:38.127 --> 41:39.249
Yeah, it's wonderful.

41:39.269 --> 41:40.331
So I'd love to see you there.

41:40.351 --> 41:40.752
Well, you will.

41:40.792 --> 41:42.495
Carter Burden is in my book.

41:42.475 --> 41:44.278
Oh, see, I didn't know.

41:44.298 --> 41:45.379
Is he a bibliophile?

41:45.399 --> 41:46.421
Oh, my God.

41:46.441 --> 41:51.428
He has the great collection of 20th century American.

41:51.448 --> 41:52.770
I mean, there's nothing like it.

41:52.790 --> 41:54.793
There's 70,000 books.

41:55.393 --> 41:55.754
I mean.

41:56.014 --> 41:56.215
No.

41:56.715 --> 41:56.836
Wow.

41:57.076 --> 41:57.717
You want to hear it?

41:58.538 --> 41:59.860
Your recorder is off, right?

42:00.521 --> 42:01.562
It's on again.

42:01.582 --> 42:02.303
You want me to put it off?

42:02.363 --> 42:03.385
Put it off, yeah.

42:03.405 --> 42:03.505
Okay.
