00:03.912 --> 00:25.899
Well, I think, for instance, when Richard Ellman was doing the biography of James Joyce, it was very useful to him that Northwestern University had a good Joyce collection.

00:26.039 --> 00:29.143
I mean, the man traveled all over the world.

00:29.647 --> 00:36.779
But nevertheless, it was nice that when he was home at Northwestern, there was a choice collection that he could deal with.

00:37.079 --> 00:49.680
I think that scholars would like to get as much information as they can from a single library.

00:50.048 --> 01:14.959
uh this may not be major information there's a basic material just as you need basic material for what you're doing there's basic material if you're doing a virginia wolf biography or f scott fits your biography and it's nice to have it close to home and

01:14.939 --> 01:20.146
This means that the library should be a research library.

01:20.166 --> 01:40.153
Since libraries' budgets increase and fall very often, it's collectors that make available to libraries what they need to read this sort of thing.

01:40.690 --> 01:56.630
Of course, once the collection goes into a library, then the collector becomes kind of superfluous.

01:56.650 --> 02:03.539
Praise random horse from whom all blessings flow.

02:03.559 --> 02:05.922
That's what I said.

02:06.053 --> 02:15.804
I remember Random House before Leona Elmsley turned it into the palace or whatever.

02:15.924 --> 02:20.730
I'm sorry I never went inside that building.

02:20.770 --> 02:28.078
When you went in from Madison Avenue, Faulkner turned to the left and you went into the Random House.

02:28.058 --> 02:36.211
It's still there, but I just see Max Perkins, you know, walking up the stairs.

02:37.413 --> 02:38.434
Now what's there now?

02:38.474 --> 02:39.356
What happened to it?

02:39.476 --> 02:42.881
Oh, that's Brink's Compost or something like that around here.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.103
Yeah, it's no longer a spritz.

02:44.203 --> 02:45.485
I know, I know.

02:45.505 --> 02:46.627
That's still a bookstore.

02:46.647 --> 02:47.108
Oh, it is?

02:47.188 --> 02:47.428
Yeah.

02:48.130 --> 02:48.430
Oh.

02:48.730 --> 02:53.444
Somebody bought it, but it's... Well, Scripps is no longer Scripps.

02:53.464 --> 02:58.318
It's an imprint of McMillan.

03:23.965 --> 03:49.247
But I know these days go off your head.

03:51.826 --> 04:04.042
Oh, I'm going to give this a five, and I'm going to give you a five here.

04:04.062 --> 04:04.222
Come on.

04:04.242 --> 04:04.322
274.

04:04.342 --> 04:12.332
Now, almost all novels, like over here, there used to be pictures, you know, there were seven of them, and that was the time when there was before you could sound there with no ego.

04:13.021 --> 04:15.944
What is the purpose of your question, of your idea?

04:16.465 --> 04:18.547
Just to get the answer.

04:18.567 --> 04:22.672
To get her started on the back of the night.

04:22.692 --> 04:27.798
I kind of decided to head on when I was in the middle.

04:27.818 --> 04:34.085
I wanted to show the American life.

04:34.105 --> 04:36.187
She was going to be caught on top of her.

04:36.207 --> 04:38.350
I thought this was to get her loose about it.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.412
Were you trying to write something about her?

04:40.679 --> 04:50.109
So this is just an archive or an old history, so to speak.

04:50.590 --> 04:54.534
Maybe the purple, purple, blue, whatever you want.

04:55.335 --> 04:58.658
Well, this was 1920, after all, it was just seven years ago.

04:58.678 --> 05:02.202
Of course, maybe when you saw it before, I went to the boy.

05:02.222 --> 05:03.784
I don't know if it's coming out already.

05:06.667 --> 05:25.013
How often did you go to New York?

05:25.212 --> 05:39.829
And then starting here in 19... By 1936, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas.

05:40.349 --> 05:46.419
So we have a lot of dinners.

05:48.383 --> 05:51.187
Now, who is she talking about here?

05:51.488 --> 05:55.715
Again, another collector, right?

05:57.077 --> 05:59.662
She's talking about a collector here?

06:00.503 --> 06:01.024
All right.

06:03.248 --> 06:27.349
And in those states, people are practically eligible for contracts.

06:27.953 --> 06:39.004
Well, there was a famous, a very famous famous famous stuff, I'm telling you, 1913.

06:39.505 --> 06:40.806
It was born by Ralph Allen.

06:40.826 --> 06:46.772
He was... Well, that was really the idea where God had to start going in the Facebook because he knew Ralph Allen very long.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.794
I was going to come in with him.

06:49.014 --> 06:49.595
I wish I had said so.

06:49.615 --> 06:53.279
If I remember, Ralph Allen was doing one.

06:53.299 --> 06:56.442
And I think the same feeling that they can possibly do the whole year when Ralph Allen was done.

06:58.463 --> 07:03.270
You don't know why we're doing it.

07:03.290 --> 07:07.256
I always say, you shouldn't know why we're doing it.

07:07.276 --> 07:11.241
We have no fact that all these people have been in business during the month, years.

07:12.723 --> 07:13.224
It was funny.

07:14.246 --> 07:15.027
You know where it was, like you.

07:15.047 --> 07:16.789
You know where it was, like you.

07:16.809 --> 07:17.991
You know where it was, like you.

07:20.722 --> 07:27.511
And everybody was going to do exercise, expertise, all the boys were these days.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.776
These people, you know, for their collections.

07:30.796 --> 07:31.957
He was wearing all the C.O.

07:34.541 --> 07:34.781
child.

07:35.242 --> 07:39.548
Yeah, he was one of the black collectors, one of the great collectors.

07:39.588 --> 07:45.015
What did she look like about this time?

07:45.035 --> 07:46.297
Little woman?

07:46.317 --> 07:46.798
Father.

07:46.818 --> 07:46.978
Father.

07:46.998 --> 07:48.400
Father, the other one again.

07:48.818 --> 07:58.307
and I thought I was going out of music, and maybe I knew all about material, one to Emerson, and one to Thoreau, and one to everything else.

07:58.567 --> 08:09.457
And we collected everything, all these books, all these, everything that I had to do with the American Indian School, especially.

08:09.517 --> 08:11.939
He was head of the American Book Company, which I can store a course.

08:14.501 --> 08:16.463
And what kind of money do they call that?

08:17.337 --> 08:24.507
When you get saved with some of the money, you know, the bride will say, what?

08:24.527 --> 08:24.788
That's right.

08:24.808 --> 08:25.429
That's right.

08:25.629 --> 08:26.330
That's right.

08:26.370 --> 08:27.311
That's right.

08:27.331 --> 08:27.872
That's right.

08:27.972 --> 08:28.493
That's right.

08:28.513 --> 08:28.854
That's right.

08:28.874 --> 08:29.274
That's right.

08:29.334 --> 08:33.380
Now, I don't know, but I don't think that is what time I know you're really looking for.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.724
He's got $10,000 a month.

08:35.744 --> 08:36.204
Six bags.

08:36.825 --> 08:37.666
Six bags.

08:37.987 --> 08:44.837
Going to the American book company, which I believe is the future, and I got it.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.157
Parola, right?

08:45.257 --> 08:45.357
Yeah.

08:45.377 --> 08:45.758
To receive bride.

08:46.666 --> 09:13.551
So whether we owe it to Waterhill or not,

09:15.286 --> 09:33.869
Every month you can spend $10,000 to buy a thing at the same time away.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.290
Money that doesn't pay for it, and it's meant for a different purpose.

09:35.310 --> 09:39.455
As far as you can say, I think you ought to have one point of view at the New York State.

09:39.475 --> 09:42.559
And also, you ought to know, the very intimate community, a very intimate community, and the

09:44.547 --> 09:53.862
What's the name of the man that books on the bottom shelf?

09:57.568 --> 10:00.953
He's got a lot of books on the shelf.

10:00.973 --> 10:01.294
Not Beverly.

10:01.915 --> 10:02.155
There it is.

10:02.175 --> 10:02.456
Homer Jackson.

10:02.476 --> 10:02.776
Homer Jackson.

10:02.796 --> 10:03.577
He, in fact, closed his head.

10:03.597 --> 10:08.966
He was back over the border in Kentucky, because I see him in those days, Illinois was down, or Ohio was down, or something or other.

10:08.986 --> 10:10.769
But Kentucky is not.

10:10.789 --> 10:10.909
So he?

10:12.020 --> 10:41.267
It was a book called Two Essays by Penwell, I think it was a boysworthy introduction.

10:43.053 --> 10:52.685
And there was a, I think there was 93 copies or something like 26 or 27.

10:52.705 --> 10:58.653
So I had a piece of manuscript, old heavy manuscript for me.

10:58.933 --> 11:09.907
And he asked me, that when he was old with a character, did he try to focus?

11:10.828 --> 11:11.068
So they did.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.209
Extra, extra copies.

11:13.230 --> 11:15.713
It was $100.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.901
And I really liked how it became.

11:20.921 --> 11:32.237
And the one man who came and bought the book, and the one man who came and bought the book, really got it.

11:32.257 --> 11:38.626
Mr. Peterson, you know what?

11:38.706 --> 11:41.410
Well, as I say, you know, I don't know

11:42.385 --> 11:50.133
But God's word is, use him as his knee in his hand, so he didn't want to outstabble him.

11:50.394 --> 11:54.488
So that's how he really got in this word.

11:55.126 --> 12:09.064
But the only thing I do want to remember now, whether he read something with Hemingway, or how he decided, you know, whether he would do a bibliography, I really don't know.

12:09.464 --> 12:09.845
I don't know.

12:09.885 --> 12:11.607
I know, but I don't know that.

12:11.687 --> 12:21.960
But all I know is that he really, because he has been married, freedom of the press and everything between his research on Hemingway's bibliography.

12:22.177 --> 12:27.205
And that's why you make so much work, too.

12:27.225 --> 12:34.697
And you see, we are not in business in those days.

12:34.717 --> 12:36.981
Just forget, we don't have income.

12:37.001 --> 12:38.383
And we've got a living power.

12:38.403 --> 12:42.029
No question that we've got a living power.

12:42.049 --> 12:44.192
But we are the two greatest cyber-files that ever was.

12:44.713 --> 12:45.855
And then I know if I've got anything.

12:45.875 --> 12:46.456
He doesn't do any anything.

12:46.476 --> 12:48.419
He's facing the bed we are, that's in itself, what is going on.

12:48.439 --> 12:49.180
And then we know what happened.

12:51.725 --> 12:58.039
So that's how he got to know everybody's spirit, you see.

12:58.059 --> 13:01.246
He was, you know, working and all this and everything.

13:01.266 --> 13:03.330
I mean, Charles Daniel, everybody's spirit.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.800
He, I like that view, he's the common goal of doing everything that he wants.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.784
And the Thomas wrote, 1929, when it came out,

13:10.692 --> 13:20.968
Thomas Wolfe did a great, and the Alta Allen, and all the wealth in the books.

13:20.988 --> 13:22.130
That was Edward Weldon.

13:22.150 --> 13:26.396
Oh, there was so many of those great kids.

13:26.416 --> 13:28.019
But there were not these young kids like our now.

13:28.039 --> 13:29.681
Many young kids.

13:29.701 --> 13:32.606
And I can all find a family name.

13:32.626 --> 13:38.455
And the next year, we were in the business in 1903, and you and I told her, I went on a bike, and I'm so stubborn for those books, because that's my work, how I work.

13:41.725 --> 13:55.290
So, he couldn't go anywhere.

13:55.951 --> 13:58.135
He couldn't go anywhere.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.197
He couldn't go anywhere.

13:59.217 --> 13:59.698
He couldn't go anywhere.

13:59.718 --> 14:00.880
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:00.900 --> 14:01.381
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:01.401 --> 14:02.062
He couldn't go anywhere anywhere.

14:02.082 --> 14:02.563
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:02.583 --> 14:03.064
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:03.665 --> 14:04.146
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:04.166 --> 14:04.667
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:04.687 --> 14:05.168
He couldn't go anywhere.

14:05.350 --> 14:21.172
You have to think, oh, we can't have that guy, we can't offer you this guy, we can't do this.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.077
You know what I mean?

14:24.097 --> 14:32.809
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

14:33.262 --> 14:59.353
So they really went together for two years to say, you know, we left now because I didn't know how well my mom would stand on their own.

14:59.373 --> 15:02.097
And we got married to 10, and I just told you, at the same time, we went out of a year for the, you know, for the first time.

15:02.117 --> 15:03.218
If we margin for the two, it's not for the matter here.

15:03.367 --> 15:11.861
No good, I've got it in the, you know, things like that.

15:12.121 --> 15:21.657
Well, as you said, don't want to come away.

15:21.677 --> 15:22.718
I don't know how to survive.

15:24.582 --> 15:24.882
I really don't.

15:24.902 --> 15:25.142
You're good.

15:25.162 --> 15:26.184
I heard that you probably accepted before.

15:26.204 --> 15:27.366
Well, let's get some of these at a time.
