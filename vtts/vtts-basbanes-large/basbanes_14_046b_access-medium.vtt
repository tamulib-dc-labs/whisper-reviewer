WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:01.939
You see that?

00:02.219 --> 00:04.202
Those subjects are all arbitrary.

00:04.582 --> 00:09.650
I mean, Dewey came up with the Dewey decimal numbers and started slicing stuff up.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.316
It's all arbitrary categorization.

00:14.336 --> 00:16.359
It's a human invention scheme.

00:17.220 --> 00:23.069
But there is no natural order of balance, I don't think.

00:23.089 --> 00:27.515
Everything is literature, which is basically fiction.

00:27.535 --> 00:29.658
I don't think that.

00:29.678 --> 00:29.818
I mean,

00:30.271 --> 00:49.121
But I suppose one thing, by consolidating, you know, you might have a librarian or a curator for a certain collection and, you know, by consolidating, you know, less expertise.

00:50.764 --> 00:53.528
A number of librarians have no relationship

00:58.165 --> 01:07.136
The number of librarians on the staff are vegetary, to see, and make poetic numbers.

01:07.156 --> 01:09.679
So, there's no... There's no magic number.

01:10.680 --> 01:22.435
I've yet to go into a library that had enough librarians, because it's an inexhaustible, I mean, assuming they're trained,

01:35.037 --> 01:39.064
So there is no magic number.

01:41.769 --> 01:54.131
In the 1960s, when I worked at the Denver Public Library, and I guess sometimes I think I get in trouble, or whatever the word is, because I have very high standards.

01:55.693 --> 01:56.956
I can't go for excellence.

01:56.976 --> 01:57.737
I don't want to try.

01:59.590 --> 02:06.260
At the Denver Public Library when I was there in the 1950s, every librarian had a secondary master's degree in their subject.

02:08.143 --> 02:09.705
They actually knew the subject.

02:12.088 --> 02:17.657
But that became a very expensive operation, and they had to drop it a long time ago.

02:18.798 --> 02:25.328
And so, I think it's very difficult for a librarian

02:25.898 --> 02:34.229
to have a broad enough now—I mean, to get the magic fit, if you will.

02:34.249 --> 02:53.475
I tend to feel that the better use is for them to learn the techniques and the mechanics and the access to the sources than to try to master the subject.

02:56.054 --> 03:02.481
But, I mean, subject departments make a lot more sense in a university area of faculties arranged by subject departments.

03:02.501 --> 03:03.382
You have students arranged by them.

03:04.463 --> 03:11.991
But the average person wandering in the front door in public library makes very little sense to them.

03:12.011 --> 03:13.653
Does this library make a statement?

03:13.713 --> 03:15.455
You know, I was at the French library.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.337
It definitely makes a statement.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.099
It's a cultural statement.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.563
It's a national library that expresses the patrimony of France.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.386
In other words, does this library make a statement?

03:27.357 --> 03:27.657
Sure.

03:28.858 --> 03:31.000
I mean, what would that statement be?

03:32.101 --> 03:39.508
I would contend that this library is the most community-connected library of any size in history.

03:39.528 --> 03:41.510
And you believe that time will bear that?

03:42.751 --> 03:43.211
Probably.

03:43.531 --> 03:48.456
I think 10 to 20 years, people will understand that building a lot better than they do.

03:49.757 --> 03:51.098
What are they missing right now?

03:52.339 --> 03:56.723
What are they failing to grasp?

03:58.222 --> 04:09.372
Well, I mean, two hundred people all have two hundred different—it's like the blind man on the elephant kind of thing, because there's so many different pieces.

04:09.392 --> 04:15.078
But I, you know, the building is still very, very busy.

04:15.098 --> 04:18.181
Six, seven thousand feet a day, I guess I'd say.

04:18.201 --> 04:18.301
Yeah.

04:18.321 --> 04:19.102
Right.

04:19.122 --> 04:22.765
How many does New York public do?

04:24.166 --> 04:24.887
Not even close.

04:26.369 --> 04:30.173
The new Sybil only does about thirty-five hours a day.

04:30.193 --> 04:31.794
Well, that's great, and that's very special.

04:31.814 --> 04:32.495
I know.

04:32.735 --> 04:44.166
All I'm saying is my goal was to get people, so we had the connection between people and books and knowledge and information and reading.

04:46.868 --> 04:52.274
I think the building does that, as well as any library around.

04:52.294 --> 04:55.937
And the criticisms that some

04:56.170 --> 05:01.815
Admittedly, some people make that it's, you know, not quiet.

05:01.875 --> 05:05.978
The acoustics, you know— Well, it depends on where you are.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.062
The building's designed because we knew we'd have high traffic.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.803
The center is a high-traffic area.

05:12.644 --> 05:15.306
If you're in the base of the atrium, darn right it's snowy.

05:16.768 --> 05:23.714
But you can go up and out, and go to the Chinese and American center room, go to the fifth floor.

05:24.174 --> 05:25.215
There's quiet spaces.

05:26.782 --> 05:44.303
I asked Regina yesterday, and I'll tell you who she was, I said, do you think that the public library, like San Francisco, can it function as a research level library?

05:44.363 --> 05:44.924
She said no.

05:45.364 --> 05:45.805
I agree.

05:46.646 --> 05:47.707
And you do agree with that.

05:47.987 --> 05:48.368
I agree.

05:49.609 --> 05:55.236
What sense does it make to try to replicate two of the largest

05:55.418 --> 06:01.063
in the world—Stanford, UC Berkeley.

06:01.083 --> 06:09.592
The public—I mean, maybe we're into definition—the public, well, is doing research at these things.

06:09.612 --> 06:10.593
Certainly at that level.

06:11.874 --> 06:13.335
Right.

06:13.355 --> 06:23.265
If they are interested at that level, they are probably in an academic program, or probably have access to university life.

06:23.549 --> 06:27.714
Of course, matters like San Francisco history, that would be an exception.

06:27.734 --> 06:28.495
Oh, I agree.

06:28.515 --> 06:31.598
That's the best history of culture in San Francisco in the world.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.461
As well as should be.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.985
Working hard to make it matter.

06:37.005 --> 06:41.690
What's your take on these affinity homes and groups?

06:42.191 --> 06:49.860
This is something that's new to me, you know, that eczema, you know, if you're a group and you want to

06:51.241 --> 07:04.698
contribute X amount of dollars, then you can have the Filipino-American affinity room, or the gay-lesbian room, or this or that, you know.

07:05.239 --> 07:15.291
Is this something that you developed in concert with the library board and the— Well, I think— We haven't even gotten into the library board concept, either.

07:15.311 --> 07:18.936
The genesis was Steve Colton.

07:20.333 --> 07:37.169
When we were trying to figure out how to get a new library, back to the poll in 1988, we knew that the people of San Francisco were passionate about their neighborhoods.

07:37.189 --> 07:46.358
And for the main library, they were, generally speaking, embarrassed about its state of affairs.

07:48.667 --> 08:08.256
And while people did use it, 2,500 people a day, roughly, there was no passion around it, except for a handful of people, including Marjorie Stern and Migmar, the three ladies in the book.

08:08.276 --> 08:17.830
Anyway, so we knew if we were going to raise that kind of money, we had to take a rather large, monolithic institution and disaggregate it.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.711
into pieces that people could be passionate about.

08:25.295 --> 08:41.692
So, Steve started working on what he called the compact, the stakeholder compact idea, which turned out to be too intellectual for practically everybody, I think.

08:42.733 --> 08:46.197
But then, as we were in process, and we were faced with, you know,

08:46.278 --> 08:50.565
There's no way we were going to get any money to furnish that building.

08:50.585 --> 08:53.150
You can't buy it out of bond issue by state law.

08:54.833 --> 09:02.205
And to get that ton of money out of the city budget, which had been running a $150 million deficit every year, was draining.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.835
We actually thought raising it in private was pretty close to draining, too.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.661
But to do that, we knew we had to create

09:12.451 --> 09:20.242
elements in the library that people would become passionate about and would support—their time and their money.

09:20.262 --> 09:33.902
Secondly, my view was the old library—and I contend some folks would like it to return to the days—the old library was kind of a club kind of environment.

09:34.591 --> 09:42.580
It was so difficult to find things in there, and it was—you kind of had to be an insider to really use the plan.

09:43.061 --> 09:57.257
I mean, not technically, but—so it was almost kind of a club kind of thing, and it ignored major parts of the population of the city.

09:57.277 --> 10:04.125
The previous city archivist, who she and I did not get along well, did not quite

10:07.733 --> 10:15.285
material on the gay and lesbian community.

10:15.305 --> 10:18.369
Did not collect material on the Chinese-American community.

10:18.450 --> 10:24.799
Did not—I mean, huge sectors of our population were ignored.

10:24.819 --> 10:28.645
But the Chinese-American community you mentioned, they're not an affinity group?

10:29.166 --> 10:31.310
Yeah, they are.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.652
Are they?

10:32.712 --> 10:34.374
They raised a million dollars.

10:34.394 --> 10:35.496
Did they?

10:36.640 --> 10:41.006
So we were looking for a way to generate the support and the interest.

10:41.026 --> 10:52.643
So back to, I mean, my commitment, Steve's and my commitment was to try to do the best as possible, to strive for everything.

10:52.663 --> 10:53.143
It would take money.

10:54.325 --> 11:04.960
So, but it also accomplished part of my goal, which is to become community connected and to involve, same as the community had never been involved in the library before.

11:07.336 --> 11:09.098
I did.

11:09.118 --> 11:11.882
Raised the money, got them involved.

11:11.902 --> 11:13.304
There's a lot of misconception.

11:13.544 --> 11:24.338
All those spaces are essentially celebration spaces and display spaces and quiet reading places most of the time.

11:24.358 --> 11:27.582
They're not designed to be many like that.

11:27.602 --> 11:32.048
I did not— No repositories for research collections.

11:32.308 --> 11:32.509
No.

11:32.769 --> 11:35.132
I did not want to break the collections up.

11:35.922 --> 11:37.965
into little nooks and crannies.

11:38.226 --> 11:45.819
That's what the old library was, because people can't find them.

11:45.839 --> 11:58.119
I also wanted—I mean, it tied in with the architecture of having those corners, the special architectural spaces.

11:58.139 --> 11:59.702
So, it was a combination of factors.

12:00.745 --> 12:08.052
But it was not designed to be a small library or a collection or a research collection.

12:08.072 --> 12:08.553
Not in there.

12:09.033 --> 12:17.261
The closest thing it would be would be the gay lesbian collection, which they provided operational money to support.

12:19.103 --> 12:29.233
And so, going back to the acquisitions, not only did the book collection acquisition dribble, the archives jumped dramatically, too.

12:31.559 --> 12:38.306
So, you know, the books people were donating jumped.

12:38.326 --> 12:44.853
The whole thing just went up geometrically.

12:44.873 --> 12:48.176
Do printed books figure in the future, in your view?

12:48.497 --> 12:52.861
Certainly.

12:52.881 --> 12:56.605
Well, we have mothers, I mean.

13:02.339 --> 13:07.445
The whole thing is, you know... I don't know why people keep trying to get me to say the books are going to go away.

13:07.485 --> 13:09.227
They're not.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.612
Some of them are going to change their function.

13:14.632 --> 13:18.216
Reference books would be history intended.

13:18.457 --> 13:23.102
Yeah, and, you know, maybe the OED, the Oxford English Dictionary, is better on the computer.

13:23.222 --> 13:24.643
I mean, the words are changing every day.

13:24.723 --> 13:27.486
The Encyclopedia Britannica changes every day.

13:27.827 --> 13:30.810
Well, no, I think the OED... I tried the OED online.

13:30.910 --> 13:31.671
I think it sucked.

13:31.938 --> 13:34.021
I've not tried it online, yeah.

13:35.042 --> 13:36.764
And they may have new versions now.

13:36.965 --> 13:42.292
But, I mean, there are certain things that are better as a book, and certain things that are better as a computer.

13:44.054 --> 13:49.481
I mean, one of the challenges you have is if this book didn't come out until 1999.

13:49.501 --> 13:50.122
Yeah, that's right.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.325
That's what will have changed by that time.

13:52.345 --> 13:59.194
Oh, that's why I plan to, you know, write this chapter, like, immediately.

14:00.322 --> 14:07.730
And then revisit it at the, you know, like if I call you again to go off a few things or something.

14:08.370 --> 14:22.165
You can never be, obviously, a book, a printed book cannot be immediate, but you can certainly try and bring it as close to publication as you can.

14:22.325 --> 14:25.188
And this is not meant to be a work of journalism, so it is.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.371
There is a little more perspective.

14:30.781 --> 14:31.562
Are there lessons?

14:31.742 --> 14:38.169
I mean—well, certainly it didn't end happily for you.

14:38.189 --> 14:42.193
I mean, it ended up— What do you think?

14:42.213 --> 14:43.675
It was time for me to move on.

14:43.695 --> 14:45.457
I started thinking of leaving last fall.

14:48.320 --> 14:48.540
Why?

14:50.022 --> 14:51.163
I did what I said I'd do.

14:53.986 --> 14:57.970
And I tend to be a builder, not a runner.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.781
I was—for a variety of reasons.

15:02.801 --> 15:07.947
I took a month off, went to Baja in the motor home, came back.

15:08.408 --> 15:13.594
Anyway, a lot of the fun had gone out of it, so I didn't want to do that anymore.

15:13.694 --> 15:16.017
Politics got into it.

15:16.077 --> 15:18.180
The hassles got into it.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.021
And I was tired.

15:19.341 --> 15:23.206
I spent ten years of my life working on that thing, practically seven days a week.

15:23.787 --> 15:24.868
And as you say, it's done.

15:26.050 --> 15:26.750
And we opened it.

15:26.810 --> 15:28.092
We got it open.

15:29.033 --> 15:29.914
public use, is it?

15:32.477 --> 15:34.680
So you do feel it was time to move on?

15:34.700 --> 15:34.941
Oh, yeah.

15:34.961 --> 15:37.744
I wouldn't have stayed there very long.

15:38.185 --> 15:40.588
I had not planned on staying there for the rest of my career.

15:40.768 --> 15:41.389
Good grief.

15:41.809 --> 15:43.271
How old are you now?

15:43.291 --> 15:45.875
Fifty-seven.

15:45.935 --> 15:48.738
Would you like to build another library after what you've been through here?

15:49.639 --> 15:53.384
Probably not.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.447
It takes a lot of time and energy.

15:57.389 --> 15:57.910
I think

15:58.852 --> 16:00.574
If I did that, I wouldn't be a director.

16:00.635 --> 16:05.321
I'd either be a consultant, which I'm not that interested in, or a king.

16:06.483 --> 16:09.648
Plus king of libraries, I might do it.

16:12.412 --> 16:14.374
Because I would want the authority up front.

16:16.297 --> 16:17.799
To do what?

16:17.819 --> 16:18.661
To do the project.

16:21.645 --> 16:22.586
Without interference?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.453
No, I didn't hire the architect.

16:27.473 --> 16:28.555
I didn't handle the money.

16:30.374 --> 16:34.839
The Department of Public Works managed the contract.

16:34.859 --> 16:38.924
We had—in my career here, I had four mayors.

16:40.305 --> 16:43.349
I had at least forty-five commissioners.

16:44.710 --> 16:48.394
I had three commissions in eighteen months.

16:48.414 --> 16:59.487
One of the members of the Board of Supervisors who feel they are elected to fix potholes, et cetera, and so they're not reluctant to tell the department has what to do.

16:59.855 --> 17:05.464
When they set up the charter in 1932, it was reacting to the graft in the city.

17:05.504 --> 17:11.794
They dispersed the power in the city so much, nobody could run the city.

17:11.814 --> 17:15.680
They changed the charter, and Mayor Brown is in, and he's running the city.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.223
There's no question about it.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.246
No, he's running the city.

17:20.308 --> 17:20.909
No.

17:20.929 --> 17:25.356
But when I came here, no one was running the city, because you had the controller.

17:26.112 --> 17:35.727
who at that time was appointed for life and had to pre-approve every expenditure over four hundred dollars out of a two-billion dollar pension.

17:36.629 --> 17:39.353
And he should have retired ten years before.

17:41.417 --> 17:50.511
We had the CAO, because California counties had county administrators, like county managers, who are both city and county.

17:50.571 --> 17:51.713
What is CAO's staff?

17:51.793 --> 17:53.436
Chief Administrative Officer.

17:54.597 --> 18:02.805
So, the CAO at that time was appointed for ten years and had total control over the Department of Public Works Convention Center.

18:04.366 --> 18:10.292
Big, probably about fifty percent of the cities left here.

18:10.312 --> 18:14.816
Unaccountable to anyone.

18:15.637 --> 18:22.663
Had a department that's been very, very changed for a long, long time.

18:22.981 --> 18:28.329
And if I couldn't get along with him, forget it.

18:28.349 --> 18:29.331
It wouldn't happen.

18:31.114 --> 18:36.081
So, every decision was appealable.

18:36.101 --> 18:48.921
If I made a decision and the staff didn't like it, they could go to the commission, they could go to the board of supervisors, they could go to the mayor, they could go to the union, they could go to the press.

18:51.753 --> 18:57.358
It was quite a tap tap to move this thing through.

19:01.062 --> 19:03.324
I think I've got plenty of stuff.

19:03.344 --> 19:03.785
Okay.

19:04.505 --> 19:08.009
Unless anything I've missed, anything you want to add?

19:08.089 --> 19:14.695
No, I'd say we'll come back before you put it to bed and see if anything's changed.

19:14.735 --> 19:17.338
All right, well, I plan to, actually.

19:17.909 --> 19:29.904
I think you understood the issue of the question of whether major public libraries should be research libraries or not.

19:30.104 --> 19:42.600
One of the difficulties we have in this country is we have no mechanism really in place to have a depository of last resort.

19:43.525 --> 19:54.036
Now, I was in discussions with Peter Lyman at UC Berkeley to let me send stuff over to the Northern California repository, which he—in his daily work.

19:54.236 --> 20:04.906
And we had agreed mentally that that was a good plan, to do a way to go from the city to the state better.

20:04.926 --> 20:09.071
Not simple, and I had a couple other things I was trying to do at the time.

20:09.091 --> 20:13.515
So, I'll give Baker credit for that concept.

20:13.782 --> 20:19.451
there needs to be a home for last copy in the country, and there is none.

20:19.471 --> 20:40.043
And, you know, I didn't even raise the issue, but, you know, so many libraries all over the country, and this is the longest on you on this one, but everyone's doing it, are getting rid of books without checking to see if it's a last copy.

20:40.748 --> 20:44.572
You know, and OCLC can tell you if it's a last copy, too.

20:44.672 --> 20:50.639
Well, not necessarily.

20:50.659 --> 20:59.368
In fact, someday we're going to wake up, OCLC will have the largest bibliographic database in the world, but no one has the books anymore.

20:59.388 --> 21:04.974
Because most of the people who loaded the early records didn't inventory.

21:05.054 --> 21:08.798
They sent their shelf list to Taiwan, and somebody couponsed the card.

21:10.685 --> 21:18.957
Now, over time, that's lessened because as you buy a new one and you get the record from OCLC, they can make that connection.

21:20.078 --> 21:24.204
But don't kid yourself that OCLC is accurate on the last copy.

21:25.887 --> 21:34.198
So actually what you're suggesting is that there are more last copies, that there are probably more books accounted for on that list than there are books.

21:34.539 --> 21:40.027
There are more bibliographic records than there are books by a magnitude of several million.

21:40.047 --> 21:40.287
Really?

21:40.756 --> 21:51.011
So, you know, one of our strengths, public libraries in this world, is we're local institutions.

21:51.131 --> 21:56.639
One of our liabilities is we're local institutions.

21:56.659 --> 22:08.316
I think, you know, the state of California should have a last copy depository and should have a system in place to encourage libraries to send the material that no longer fits their collection profile.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.211
But we don't have that.

22:14.114 --> 22:14.435
Okay.

22:15.438 --> 22:16.542
Have fun.

22:16.562 --> 22:16.722
Okay.

22:16.863 --> 22:17.786
Good.

22:17.806 --> 22:19.431
Thomas, is there anything else that you want?

22:19.451 --> 22:19.993
No, I don't think so.
