WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:02.694
Well, congratulations.

00:02.714 --> 00:03.515
I have a new book.

00:03.535 --> 00:06.561
I've talked with Andre Brink.

00:09.526 --> 00:14.755
I've interviewed a number of your country men and women.

00:14.836 --> 00:22.349
I did an interview with Nadine Gortimer a couple of years ago when she was at Harvard, pointing across the river to Harvard.

00:23.171 --> 00:23.912
And...

00:24.314 --> 00:29.001
It's quite a remarkable pantheon of literary writers.

00:29.121 --> 00:30.142
It is, it is.

00:30.162 --> 00:38.094
The one sad thing, as far as the outside world is concerned, is that nobody seems to know the whole array of very good black writers we also have.

00:38.114 --> 00:44.042
For some reason, only a few white writers became internationally known.

00:44.062 --> 00:45.023
Why do you suppose that is?

00:45.424 --> 00:47.968
I think universal racism, really.

00:48.468 --> 00:48.608
Really?

00:48.628 --> 00:53.275
But also, there were practical reasons most of the black authors were

00:54.149 --> 00:57.894
only concerned with promoting the struggle for liberation.

00:58.014 --> 01:08.247
And literary reasons and international reputation were the last things they would be thinking about.

01:08.268 --> 01:08.948
It is interesting.

01:08.968 --> 01:13.915
This is the first post-apartheid novel for you, I believe.

01:14.115 --> 01:14.396
Yes.

01:16.038 --> 01:19.763
And that must have been quite a challenge for you.

01:20.524 --> 01:21.625
Very much so.

01:21.723 --> 01:28.739
It's almost like John le Carre writing about... Yes, I think he finds himself in much the same position.

01:28.779 --> 01:36.958
And I've had the opportunity over the last few years to talk very often with writers from the Central European countries.

01:36.978 --> 01:38.902
And many of those have stopped writing altogether.

01:38.922 --> 01:40.947
They say there's nothing left to write about.

01:41.247 --> 01:47.476
But I think that takes a very short view, short-term view of it.

01:47.496 --> 01:52.163
I think it also takes a pretty short-term view of what a novelist is.

01:52.683 --> 01:53.645
Absolutely.

01:53.745 --> 02:00.054
Now maybe if you're a writer who writes just about the political conditions in your country, then maybe that's true.

02:00.074 --> 02:00.374
Yes.

02:01.015 --> 02:03.419
Then you're out of a job.

02:03.479 --> 02:09.988
And this really is what I want to explore today because I write a literary column and of course I'm interested in

02:10.407 --> 02:33.539
in the political conditions and statements that you make, but the craft of writing is what... Absolutely, and I think that is the sanest thing that came out of the changeover there as far as writers were concerned, that at long last one can be judged purely in terms of the quality of one's writing, not in terms of the cause you promote or whether you're on the good or the bad side or whatever.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.444
And I think that's very healthy for literature.

02:38.639 --> 02:56.257
You know, there is an attitude, unfortunately, here in much of the United States, and England as well, where, you know, I don't know what the situation is in South Africa, where people read purely for entertainment, and you really do get a lot of mindless things.

02:56.618 --> 02:56.898
Oh, yes.

02:59.641 --> 03:07.549
Maybe we could just enter the discussion, if you could give me some insight on your...

03:07.816 --> 03:13.905
attitude as to what... I mean, does writing, does your fiction have to be relevant, I guess, as a place to start?

03:14.546 --> 03:18.833
Is relevance a necessary emolument of your writing?

03:18.853 --> 03:27.065
I think... To me personally, that is... To me personally, that is important.

03:27.085 --> 03:30.490
But then relevance, of course, is a very elastic term, too.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.439
During the apartheid years, it was important for me, immensely important,

03:36.959 --> 03:56.701
to get across an image of what was happening in the country and to try and interpret it, of course, basically for myself but also for others, at a time when journalists simply couldn't do their job because they were proscribed by so many laws in the country.

03:57.722 --> 04:06.291
And it meant that novelists had to start doing some practically ordinary journalistic reportage in their novels

04:06.608 --> 04:19.288
But the test for the novel has always been and remained even in those difficult times whether it can make something lasting out of the events of every day.

04:19.308 --> 04:34.472
In other words, to go through the surface of the purely political menu of the day and to try and grapple with those deeper human emotional problems which

04:35.684 --> 04:59.937
concern people anywhere in any society of the world and it was a very great reassurance to me very often to to get letters for instance from people in India or Pakistan or North Ireland saying that you may think that you wrote a novel about South Africa but in fact it is about India or about Ireland and that sort of thing because

05:00.608 --> 05:14.719
It is the human story, what really happens to people, to individuals, men, women, children, that concerns me, and not politics as an ideology or as a theoretical system somewhere out there.

05:15.593 --> 05:23.068
My own sense is that the novelist who becomes too politicized tends to wind up writing boring novels.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.072
Absolutely, yes.

05:25.873 --> 05:30.001
Because if you want to thump a barrel, then get up on a stage and do that.

05:30.743 --> 05:37.416
But if you use the novel as a form to express yourself, to explore the world, to discover what the world is like,

05:38.206 --> 05:46.697
then the audience you target is different, the quality of your writing is different, your whole concern is different.

05:46.717 --> 05:57.111
It seems to me that Solzhenitsyn was a great writer when he was writing novels, but then when he became so consumed... Appalling, appalling.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.995
He's probably the most illustrious example of

06:00.835 --> 06:03.501
of the pitfalls of political writing.

06:04.002 --> 06:07.370
So you do walk a fine line, you do, don't you?

06:07.390 --> 06:08.994
Absolutely, I'm very conscious of that, yes.

06:09.014 --> 06:11.360
How important a story to you?

06:11.380 --> 06:13.785
Enormously.

06:13.805 --> 06:17.173
And it is becoming more and more consciously so because

06:17.660 --> 06:39.634
In South Africa, where one can draw on at least two large streams of storytelling, the great narrative tradition of the West and the wealth of oral literature, or whatever you want to call it, in Black Africa,

06:40.525 --> 06:48.814
And both of these, they can feed into one another, they can illuminate new unexpected aspects of each other.

06:48.834 --> 07:09.115
And there's always been this treasure house of stories in Africa, in South Africa, as far as I'm concerned, among the black people, but also among the Afrikaners, who during the many years, a couple of centuries in which they subsisted mainly in the deep interior, cut off from the world outside.

07:09.567 --> 07:14.613
had to entertain themselves and sustain themselves through the stories they told.

07:14.633 --> 07:35.640
And now that apartheid is no longer there to impose a kind of order of precedence on things one regards as most important to be most urgently written, now I can go back to those stories that have been lying fallow and silent for so long.

07:36.721 --> 07:38.443
And the imagination can...

07:38.947 --> 07:39.868
run riot.

07:40.909 --> 07:46.195
You open this new novel, of course, the grandmother is a storyteller, isn't she?

07:46.475 --> 07:47.196
Yes, yes.

07:47.276 --> 07:50.800
You're paying great tribute, I think, to that tradition.

07:51.561 --> 08:02.673
And I think perhaps specifically in Africa, but I know also in some Slavic and Central European cultures, the women are indeed the storytellers.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.777
They are the repositories of the

08:07.398 --> 08:10.802
The wisdom, collective wisdom of people over the centuries.

08:10.922 --> 08:12.083
And memory, of course.

08:12.364 --> 08:12.764
Oh, yes.

08:13.145 --> 08:14.947
Oh, yes.

08:16.128 --> 08:22.395
I have written a book about, it's a non-fiction book, but it is about memory and records and preservation.

08:22.415 --> 08:31.245
I'm very fascinated by all of these different aspects that I read about.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.376
You wrote this book in English, I gather, is that correct?

08:34.396 --> 08:39.924
No, I write everything with rare exception in both languages at the same time.

08:40.064 --> 08:41.806
I've never heard of such a thing.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.108
It is weird.

08:43.128 --> 08:54.104
I must confess I don't know, and I don't know in advance, how a certain book is going to develop because each book seems to impose its own pattern and its own use of language.

08:54.845 --> 09:00.793
In this one I wrote the contemporary parts in English, but the stories were all written in Afrikaans.

09:01.853 --> 09:03.795
And then it means cross-translating.

09:03.916 --> 09:06.018
Do you do all of your own translation?

09:06.219 --> 09:06.959
Oh, yes.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.423
Because it's much more than translation.

09:09.443 --> 09:11.545
It's rewriting, rediscovering.

09:12.406 --> 09:21.638
You write something, say, in Afrikaans, rework it in English, and in that process you discover things you hadn't realized while writing the Afrikaans.

09:21.658 --> 09:23.220
So you go back to the Afrikaans.

09:23.504 --> 09:26.408
And then you discover things you'd missed in the English.

09:26.428 --> 09:26.508
Wow.

09:27.409 --> 09:28.550
It's doing and throwing.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.491
That's remarkable.

09:29.511 --> 09:35.058
And it can go on endlessly, but at a certain moment, of course, you've got to say, now, stop.

09:35.078 --> 09:37.682
And do you publish them simultaneously in both languages?

09:37.702 --> 09:38.403
Usually, yes.

09:38.703 --> 09:45.191
In this case, the Afrikaans one came out a few months earlier, but that was just due to the publisher schedule.

09:45.912 --> 09:49.076
How about the thinking about the creative process here?

09:49.096 --> 09:50.057
Do you switch between languages?

09:50.077 --> 09:51.699
It happens in both languages, yes.

09:52.300 --> 09:52.380
Yes.

09:53.204 --> 09:55.287
That's remarkable.

09:55.307 --> 10:07.303
And it started as a strategy for survival as a writer, really, because I used to write only in Afrikaans until my first book, Looking on Darkness, was banned.

10:07.323 --> 10:09.406
And then suddenly I was a writer without a reader.

10:10.408 --> 10:17.998
So simply to survive, to ensure that what I wrote in future could be read, I started writing in English as well.

10:18.519 --> 10:19.880
You were a writer without a reader.

10:20.782 --> 10:21.743
At that time, yes.

10:22.263 --> 10:25.488
And then you're not a writer because you've got to be read to.

10:26.549 --> 10:30.956
It was one of the most devastating discoveries of my life.

10:32.197 --> 10:36.544
I'd suddenly written myself into oblivion, as it were.

10:36.604 --> 10:38.567
I was a non-person in terms of writing.

10:40.109 --> 10:49.182
And if writing is important to one, and obviously I live through writing, it is immensely important to me, then you need readers to...

10:50.140 --> 11:00.292
And that, as I say, if I couldn't find the readers in my own country due to censorship, I had to make sure at least that my books could be published in English.

11:00.312 --> 11:07.040
And from there I was fortunate enough to be translated in many other languages.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.002
Did you leave the country?

11:09.022 --> 11:09.222
No.

11:10.244 --> 11:17.532
I, ironically perhaps, towards the end of the 60s, I left the country to live in Paris.

11:18.473 --> 11:24.721
And it was then with the intention of... Yes, yes.

11:25.702 --> 11:29.406
I had a very good friend in Paris and I could live with them.

11:31.188 --> 11:37.877
So I went with the intention at least of assessing the possibilities of staying there permanently.

11:38.838 --> 11:42.342
But then as it happened, the year I spent there was 68.

11:42.402 --> 11:47.248
And as a result of everything that happened in the streets of Paris,

11:47.752 --> 11:58.044
I just realized that there is a very important, very real link, a bond between an individual and a society.

11:58.064 --> 12:02.570
And to live in Paris and criticize at a safe distance just wasn't on.

12:04.071 --> 12:08.797
So I knew I had to go back and do my writing there, and that changed the whole tone of my writing.

12:10.639 --> 12:14.704
And the first book that came out of that was Looking on Darkness, which got banned.

12:15.308 --> 12:21.654
So all kinds of things flowed from that one decision, but I haven't regretted it for a moment.

12:21.674 --> 12:30.542
So when you are mindfully, when you know that you are a writer without a reader, what happens?

12:31.022 --> 12:35.546
Because you must have a reader in mind when you're writing.

12:35.566 --> 12:37.227
I'm not always so sure of that.

12:37.267 --> 12:43.493
I think when I am grappling with the first draft of a book,

12:44.249 --> 12:47.495
then it's really only me and what's happening in the paper.

12:48.457 --> 13:01.119
It's a complex of experience that I've got to work through and get to grips with for myself to find out what happened, what has it done to me.

13:02.622 --> 13:08.232
And then when I start working on that text, then I have to start thinking of, well,

13:08.853 --> 13:12.258
Am I going to get across what I want to?

13:12.278 --> 13:13.960
So how is the reader going to react?

13:13.980 --> 13:21.031
And that means that when I write in English, the target is different from the one in Afrikaans.

13:22.433 --> 13:35.772
Because when I write in Afrikaans, I have to have in mind the sort of standard Africana of the time, the more or less conservative supporter of the National Party, Calvinistic, traditionalist.

13:36.646 --> 13:44.378
And you've got to approach that quite differently from when you have a broad-minded liberal reader.

13:44.659 --> 13:46.402
A broad in mind.

13:46.422 --> 13:52.992
Well, then when you are writing the two languages, which let me repeat, I've never heard of... There are some.

13:53.092 --> 14:00.745
I spoke to the Chilean novelist and playwright, Ariel Dorfman, recently.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.147
Apparently he does the same.

14:03.798 --> 14:06.001
I mean, even I.B.

14:06.061 --> 14:10.948
Singer, for all the years that he lived in America here.

14:10.968 --> 14:14.954
He kept writing in Hebrew, Yiddish or Hebrew.

14:14.974 --> 14:16.676
It had to be Yiddish.

14:16.756 --> 14:21.323
It would have been Yiddish, yes.

14:21.343 --> 14:30.535
But I wonder then, when you are writing mindfully in two languages, do they become two different books?

14:30.555 --> 14:33.079
Actually, yes, but that is...

14:33.346 --> 14:35.169
also perhaps an elastic term.

14:35.810 --> 14:39.075
Sometimes the differences are very, I mean, there are always differences.

14:39.716 --> 14:45.846
Sometimes they're quite small, a matter of nuance, a matter of punctuation, a matter of paragraph division and so on.

14:46.447 --> 14:51.115
Sometimes there are whole episodes in one book which are not in the other because they don't work.

14:51.135 --> 14:51.275
Really?

14:51.595 --> 14:51.816
Yes.

14:51.836 --> 14:53.779
Yeah, how about this new book?

14:53.799 --> 14:58.567
There's one longish episode in the Afrikaans one which is not in English.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.670
And what is it and why is it not in English?

15:01.139 --> 15:16.102
Basically, I still am not sure that I agreed with him, but my editor in Britain, he said that the point had been made in other episodes, and English is so much a language of understatement.

15:16.122 --> 15:18.665
I thought it added something to it.

15:20.648 --> 15:30.403
It was an incident from the narrator's youth at school, which I thought illuminated her sort of headstrongness and willfulness in a

15:31.092 --> 15:34.136
slightly different way from the other episodes from that time.

15:35.639 --> 15:37.121
But, well, there you are.

15:37.141 --> 15:47.636
But sometimes it's purely a matter of finding, perhaps due to my control or lack of it, of the language, that something works in the one and not in the other.

15:47.997 --> 15:53.665
I think we could probably water because he hasn't had an appointment yet.

15:53.685 --> 15:55.568
Okay, we're back on.

15:56.108 --> 15:59.293
We were talking about, I guess...

15:59.493 --> 16:15.968
I was interested in how you had a long segment, you said, in the Afrikaans version of the new novel, which you did translate and use in the English language, and that mainly came as a comment from your English editor.

16:16.448 --> 16:16.768
Yes.

16:16.788 --> 16:20.612
But I just wondered briefly if you could... You said it was from the narrator's childhood.

16:20.632 --> 16:23.494
Can you just tell me briefly what it was?

16:23.715 --> 16:27.458
It concerns an episode at school when she was about...

16:27.843 --> 16:28.804
12 or 13.

16:29.825 --> 16:38.595
And they had a specific kind of inspection every week when the whole school gathered for morning prayers before they dispersed into the different classes.

16:39.336 --> 16:43.000
And at this inspection, well, the nails would be checked and the hair would be checked.

16:43.581 --> 16:48.466
But this is something which my wife actually told me that happened to her at her school.

16:49.087 --> 16:54.373
They also had to be checked to make sure that they were wearing the regulation underwear.

16:54.353 --> 17:03.166
So the prefect would march up and down the lines with rulers, lift the skirts and check that they were wearing the right kind of panties.

17:04.428 --> 17:14.163
And in this particular case, a friend of the narrator's was wearing ordinary white panties and not the ones that she was supposed to wear.

17:14.663 --> 17:17.087
And this child got terrified.

17:17.995 --> 17:27.785
As a result of which the narrator, when the prefect reached them, started protesting and said she's not going to allow her friend to be subjected to this indignity.

17:28.486 --> 17:34.632
So the narrator was summoned to the principal's office and got a talking to and a severe reprimand and so on.

17:34.952 --> 17:42.400
And then they checked her underwear and she had the right ones on and nobody thought of checking the other girls.

17:42.970 --> 17:51.541
I thought it revealed something about the way in which somebody can stand up for her own convictions and take the lap for somebody else.

17:51.561 --> 18:06.700
And it says something about the terrible excesses of Africana society where males can inflict that kind of humiliation on women and girls.

18:07.034 --> 18:10.437
It never occurred that you didn't object?

18:10.457 --> 18:15.962
Oh, I had a long discussion, but I have a very good relationship with this editor.

18:16.603 --> 18:30.036
I don't always yield, but he is really so astute and so sensitive that I thought, all right, in this one I'll... So you were thinking of the English language nuances here, I guess.

18:30.056 --> 18:30.956
Yes, yes.

18:31.457 --> 18:34.780
But at least, you know, with the vast majority of writers who...

18:35.333 --> 18:38.728
and I'm sure this happens with you in other languages,

18:39.080 --> 18:43.206
You know, you submit the work to somebody else, and you are totally at their mercy, aren't you?

18:43.226 --> 18:43.487
Yes.

18:44.128 --> 18:45.009
And they do make it.

18:45.029 --> 18:47.353
Which means that you've got to trust them.

18:47.373 --> 18:55.606
And for many, many years, I never really had anybody who cared enough to do proper editing.

18:55.626 --> 19:06.523
I mean, they would do little grammatical things, stylistic things here and there, or I would have a discussion, and someone would say, well, I don't think this episode works for this and this and the other reason.

19:06.543 --> 19:06.623
Yes.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.606
And then I could consider and either change or not change.

19:09.687 --> 19:16.895
But this, for the first time, and I moved to this publishing house in Britain, Secker and Warburg, only six years ago.

19:17.656 --> 19:28.208
And for the first time I landed with a real old-fashioned editor who knows his job, who's sensitively on the same wavelength, usually.

19:28.228 --> 19:33.494
So I have a wonderful feeling of trust and security there.

19:33.514 --> 19:35.817
And that's why I listened.

19:36.995 --> 19:38.797
That's a great story.

19:38.817 --> 19:47.046
I've been beyond the language, and you've already told me who your sense of your reader is.

19:47.066 --> 19:47.587
Apparently it's different.

19:47.607 --> 19:48.448
It has to be.

19:49.148 --> 20:02.003
Even in small practical ways, for instance, if I write for an Afrikaans audience, there's quite a lot of writing on the purely information level of the book, which I can take for granted.

20:02.063 --> 20:04.065
My readers know where they share the country.

20:04.653 --> 20:14.635
But if I have to tell the same story to a foreign audience, we simply have to give a little bit more, flesh out a little bit more of the information.

20:14.655 --> 20:18.323
You can't just fling a date or an episode from history at them.

20:18.423 --> 20:21.430
You've got to suggest what that episode was about.

20:21.882 --> 20:32.516
And, of course, when you're describing this whole phenomenon of raising ostriches for their feathers, that's the kind of thing you have to have absolutely right.

20:32.897 --> 20:33.257
Oh, yes.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.058
For that audience.

20:34.078 --> 20:34.579
That's right.

20:34.819 --> 20:37.823
Here, we're going to believe whatever you tell us.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.307
It's remarkable.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.970
Oh, those palaces.

20:43.090 --> 20:46.595
Unfortunately, the sad thing is that so many of them have been torn down.

20:47.176 --> 20:47.316
Uh-huh.

20:47.296 --> 20:53.964
I suppose they're just too expensive to keep up, like the old stately mansions in Britain.

20:53.984 --> 20:57.569
But the few that have remained are remarkable.

20:58.590 --> 21:14.890
And apparently that, it's been told to me in many ways, perhaps a legend, but apparently it was based on fact, the way in which these houses had the sort of shadow image of the house in the cellar.

21:15.713 --> 21:41.974
which functioned almost as a kind of subconscious to the house every room had its counterpart below the ground and these idiots actually lived there because there were only these few large families and they intermarried all the time because they didn't want to marry with commoners so after a generation or two each family had one or two or more little idiots and they were kept down there with their nannies

21:42.342 --> 21:49.754
and allowed out only once a week on Sunday afternoons between 2 and 3, when everybody was having a sayesta.

21:50.635 --> 21:52.518
And that was known as the Hour of the Idiots.

21:53.820 --> 21:57.967
And that's practically when all the neuroses and psychoses are let out.

21:57.987 --> 22:02.354
It's such a fantastic metaphor.

22:02.374 --> 22:04.317
And of course I love the Arabic folk.

22:04.499 --> 22:10.245
I read this one to my wife, where the granddaughter says, are you afraid of the ghosts?

22:10.265 --> 22:11.747
She says, no, I know them all.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.669
I love that.

22:13.949 --> 22:17.513
Oh yes, she just sort of brushes them aside.

22:18.294 --> 22:21.617
But this must come from that rich, small storytelling.

22:21.738 --> 22:22.899
Absolutely.

22:22.919 --> 22:29.926
But at the same time, it is metaphorical about the sort of adaptation South Africans have to make now.

22:29.966 --> 22:31.468
They've got to live with their ghosts.

22:32.275 --> 22:37.384
And unless we make peace with our past, we don't have a future to go to.

22:37.865 --> 22:48.244
So, we haven't even addressed yet the challenge of having a narrator as a woman and thinking as a woman.

22:48.264 --> 22:54.115
I'd love to hear your comments on the...

22:54.753 --> 22:57.477
That's a very risky thing to do.

22:57.938 --> 23:01.063
I knew it was an enormous risk, especially in these times.

23:03.387 --> 23:07.774
But I had two good reasons for persevering.

23:10.518 --> 23:16.828
The one is the simple fact that I am married to a wife who won't let me get away with anything.

23:17.450 --> 23:25.901
And she went through this manuscript with a fine-tooth comb, saying, a man would say that, a woman would never argue like this.

23:26.562 --> 23:31.789
This is a man's way of looking at a scene, or somebody else, a woman would see it this way.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.213
So she helped me enormously there.

23:35.194 --> 23:39.660
But it has seemed to me, from the beginning,

23:40.619 --> 23:46.190
But I'd often written genealogies in my previous, sorry, my third, sir.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.454
I'm sorry, you said you'd often written what?

23:48.474 --> 23:49.817
Genealogies.

23:49.837 --> 23:51.721
Cheers, nice to meet you, sir.

23:51.741 --> 23:52.622
Very nice to meet you.

23:53.985 --> 23:59.556
In most of my previous books, there is a family tree of one kind or another.

23:59.941 --> 24:03.449
but invariably they are told from a male point of view.

24:03.549 --> 24:07.959
I think the whole idea of a family tree is male in origin.

24:07.979 --> 24:12.148
So-and-so begat so-and-so begat so-and-so.

24:12.168 --> 24:19.063
And it seemed to me that part of what got lost in the process of transmitting the South African history

24:19.297 --> 24:24.046
was the huge dimension of the female experience.

24:24.647 --> 24:29.396
We had to undergo this history, and they were not allowed to talk for themselves.

24:30.137 --> 24:40.817
They almost, well, they metaphorically had their tongues cut out, as this one girl in one of my stories physically has her tongue cut out.

24:40.837 --> 24:41.338
So...

24:42.685 --> 24:49.475
It was important for me to try and transmit something of the store of stories lived by women.

24:51.297 --> 24:59.809
But I don't think I could have done that if I'd run the risk of simply appropriating a woman's voice and speaking on behalf of women.

24:59.829 --> 25:03.715
And the fortunate thing is that in South Africa right now,

25:04.302 --> 25:12.356
We have a whole array of very, very good women authors who can and do speak for themselves.

25:13.438 --> 25:19.628
So my book is one voice among many, and it's up to anybody to say.

25:20.165 --> 25:23.989
I'm not going to listen to you because you're a man and I have these women's voices.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.392
Have you encountered any of that?

25:26.592 --> 25:30.015
Not a single note of hostility from a female reviewer.

25:30.776 --> 25:36.642
I got one totally vicious, devastating review.

25:38.184 --> 25:39.045
That's excellent.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.487
Lovely, thank you.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.211
Yeah, lovely, very good idea.

25:45.231 --> 25:47.674
There was one man in England

25:48.042 --> 25:53.233
who accused me of being a barrel-thumping feminist and getting it all wrong.

25:53.253 --> 25:59.487
But not a single woman reviewer was uncomfortable with it.

25:59.703 --> 26:01.345
Well, what was his objection?

26:01.906 --> 26:04.269
That you were too sympathetic to him?

26:04.409 --> 26:17.807
Well, he just thought that I was trying, going out of my way to do the politically correct thing, but for that very reason doing the wrong thing by appropriating a woman's voice.

26:18.348 --> 26:21.272
I wonder what might have happened had you published this

26:21.539 --> 26:23.866
under a feminine suit.

26:23.886 --> 26:26.132
You know, I was very tempted to do that.

26:26.273 --> 26:27.135
I really was.

26:27.817 --> 26:33.073
We were really remarkable to see what might have happened.

26:33.093 --> 26:33.173
Yes.

26:33.193 --> 26:36.342
Just as an exercise, as an exercise in...

26:36.760 --> 26:42.627
I mean, Doris Lessing has published under... She's a famous example.

26:42.727 --> 26:45.711
She hasn't changed genders, so to speak, but she has changed identities.

26:45.731 --> 26:45.811
Yes.

26:45.871 --> 26:46.071
Oh, yes.

26:46.091 --> 26:49.255
No, I really was very tempted.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.738
Why don't we just shut this off for a while?

26:51.758 --> 26:54.241
Or do you want me to leave it on?

26:54.401 --> 26:55.943
But you just go ahead and eat.

26:57.645 --> 26:58.225
Don't mind that.

26:58.245 --> 26:58.345
Okay.

26:58.365 --> 27:04.793
Because I wonder, when you have a reader, again, we're going back to the reader, do you think the reader...

27:05.903 --> 27:12.772
I'm able to divorce the knowledge that the author is a man.

27:12.812 --> 27:16.456
Nevertheless, the voice is that of a woman.

27:16.497 --> 27:18.880
Did you see that as a problem for the reader?

27:18.980 --> 27:29.413
I imagine that it could be for some people, but I just hope that the reader could take the jump with me.

27:30.473 --> 27:33.218
When you create a voice like this, do you hear the voice?

27:34.000 --> 27:34.240
Oh, yes.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.242
You hear her voice?

27:35.262 --> 27:36.204
Oh, yes.

27:36.224 --> 27:36.946
You visualize it?

27:37.066 --> 27:39.010
Physically, oh, yes.

27:39.030 --> 27:43.198
And when you're writing, I mean, I'm just curious about the process here.

27:43.218 --> 27:52.195
This voice... Well, I would very often read passages aloud to myself to check whether it sounds right.

27:54.402 --> 27:57.206
But I certainly hear that voice very strongly.

27:57.667 --> 28:03.135
And I think all writing, all fiction writing, does start with an act of presumption.

28:03.155 --> 28:18.658
You have to presume that you can get into somebody else's mind, whether it's another man, or whether it's a woman, or whether it's a black person, or in some cases the presumption must be greater than others.

28:18.678 --> 28:23.025
But that initial act of imagining yourself into the skin of somebody else

28:23.917 --> 28:26.781
That is always there.

28:26.861 --> 28:32.249
So this is just an extension of that.

28:32.269 --> 28:36.434
That to me is the gift of anomalous.

28:37.135 --> 28:37.556
I can't do that.

28:42.403 --> 28:44.265
And I think that is the starting point of fiction.

28:44.285 --> 28:51.155
How about the element of imagination in creating the story, the plot?

28:51.175 --> 28:52.557
How do it just use as a case study this new novel?

28:54.055 --> 28:59.503
Did you start with an idea that, okay, this is post-apartheid?

28:59.623 --> 29:04.129
I want to write about... No, there was no... It wasn't such a conscious decision.

29:04.149 --> 29:15.925
I think if I have to trace it to a specific incident, normally a novel starts when a number of incidents start coalescing and growing together.

29:17.848 --> 29:22.915
But I previously taught it at another university, and

29:24.262 --> 29:44.805
The secretary I had there, her father lived alone on a farm, and very shortly before the election, a number of months before, her father's farmhouse was attacked in the night by just my band of youth who set fire to it.

29:46.026 --> 29:51.552
And he got very severely burnt and died a few days later.

29:51.869 --> 30:02.956
This happened at a time when, after a very long absence, when I hadn't visited that particular region in the country, I went back to that region where the ostrich palaces were.

30:04.460 --> 30:10.013
And these two episodes seemed to get together and some kind of spark was struck.

30:10.921 --> 30:13.423
and things.

30:13.624 --> 30:21.151
So the image of the house was the starting point.

30:21.171 --> 30:21.311
Really?

30:21.331 --> 30:27.957
And the episode of the person who got burnt, in this case a father but for my book a mother, was the trigger.

30:27.977 --> 30:28.798
Fascinating.

30:28.878 --> 30:35.605
Do you plot these things out heavily in advance or do you allow them to?

30:35.665 --> 30:37.907
I usually do an enormous amount of plotting.

30:39.018 --> 30:46.547
One thinks that is the whole iceberg below the surface.

30:46.567 --> 30:51.993
It is only when I have a pretty clear idea of the book as a whole that the writing can start.

30:52.013 --> 31:06.730
But even so, even though I may think that I know every nook and cranny of the story, when I actually start writing, all kinds of unforeseen things happen and must happen, otherwise I'd lose interest.

31:07.368 --> 31:19.606
In this particular book, in the most horrendous episode of the whole book, the conclusion, I didn't know that was going to happen.

31:20.067 --> 31:20.328
Really?

31:20.348 --> 31:28.019
It was only when I got to it that suddenly I realized, God, there's nothing else that can happen to this woman.

31:28.099 --> 31:29.241
And so it happened.

31:31.077 --> 31:51.165
You started with the image of this house.

31:51.185 --> 31:52.207
At what point did the character enter the equation?

31:52.227 --> 31:52.427
Her voice.

31:52.762 --> 32:15.259
the the old woman came into the book practically together with the image of the house and just seemed to go with it the young woman took a long time i didn't know initially i thought well it's going to be too risky to use a woman's voice

32:15.863 --> 32:17.085
try and make it a young man.

32:18.507 --> 32:21.751
But it just wasn't right.

32:21.771 --> 32:29.342
Because to me it was immensely important that the story of the family be transmitted from woman to woman.

32:31.805 --> 32:38.394
Then I tried all kinds of clever ways out to avoid having the woman as the narrator.

32:38.474 --> 32:39.576
I thought I could just use her.

32:39.843 --> 32:48.537
either a friend of a young woman to tell her story or simply do it in the third person.

32:48.557 --> 32:52.964
But that was too remote and I needed the immediacy of the experience.

32:52.984 --> 33:03.420
And having known and still knowing quite a number of the ANC exiles who came back to South Africa and living quite

33:04.210 --> 33:14.547
intimately and disconcertingly with some of their stories and enormous problems they faced when they came back from exile.

33:17.291 --> 33:24.042
That became a given for the book.

33:24.545 --> 33:47.616
now this is um you don't mind my jumping around a little bit i understand that i've read the book so i don't have to really ask questions about the book that's my job to read it you know you've done your job just to write this book you know i'm really interested the kinds of stories that i write

33:47.596 --> 34:02.232
You have written now, what, about a dozen books, I think it is?

34:02.833 --> 34:09.641
Well, a dozen novels, exactly, a dozen that have been translated into English or written in English.

34:09.661 --> 34:14.807
I wrote a number of other things only in Afrikaans, I mean, plays and literary criticism and travel books and things like that.

34:14.827 --> 34:17.029
And you were how old, though, when I just started curiously?

34:17.363 --> 34:21.067
Now, 61.

34:21.087 --> 34:21.287
Young man.

34:25.312 --> 34:32.801
So, I mean, you really haven't had a chance to assess the arc of your career, so to speak.

34:32.821 --> 34:41.190
You certainly can see some dramatic outside influences that pretty much determine where it's going, or where it is right now.

34:41.450 --> 34:44.274
And what does one do next?

34:44.294 --> 34:47.337
You have a number of many novels ahead of you, I'm sure.

34:47.620 --> 34:54.463
Oh, yes, I hope so.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.293
I think I have, for such a long time,

34:58.167 --> 35:11.306
practically from the time I started writing.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.208
Would you like to keep this on the side?

35:13.228 --> 35:18.696
Would you like I keep on the kitchen for you, sir?

35:18.716 --> 35:19.778
What are you doing?

35:19.798 --> 35:21.600
Keeping the kitchen?

35:21.620 --> 35:21.981
If you don't mind.

35:22.001 --> 35:22.622
I am here to serve you.

35:22.642 --> 35:23.703
Give us about five more minutes.

35:23.723 --> 35:24.404
Yes, I should be fine.

35:24.424 --> 35:26.487
I've had this very passionate interest in history for a long time.

35:28.373 --> 35:32.722
And I can't see that dissipating in any way.

35:32.742 --> 35:42.985
But I can now go back to tracts of South African history which have remained unexplored.

35:44.668 --> 35:47.715
There are silences there which have not been visited.

35:48.151 --> 36:02.970
uh sometimes of course people were scared of him because we didn't know about it all and much of that is coming to light through the truth and reconciliation commission at the moment or simply because during the apartheid years

36:04.418 --> 36:23.693
even if it was never a matter of feeling constrained to write about a parted, there simply always were more urgent things to write about than some of these wonderful stories that were there but had to be kept on the back burner.

36:25.563 --> 36:38.802
To me, the liberating effect of doing it in a more imaginative way.

36:38.822 --> 36:45.612
Perhaps to go more into myth and into history.

36:45.632 --> 36:46.654
Myth, was that the word?

36:46.674 --> 36:48.817
This started happening even before this book.

36:48.837 --> 36:51.301
The previous one was on the contrary.

36:52.863 --> 36:54.405
I had a...

36:55.145 --> 37:11.914
a wonderful, authentic historical character from the 18th century, a Frenchman who came to South Africa and fell foul of the authorities and laid a rebellion and ended being executed for that.

37:13.016 --> 37:19.988
But his signal characteristic was that he was a consummate liar.

37:20.170 --> 37:29.980
And he told his own life story several times before he was executed, writing long letters to the government explaining his life, and every time telling a totally different story.

37:30.801 --> 37:38.870
So I could start where he left off and keep on inventing this fantastic creature.

37:38.890 --> 37:39.350
That's remarkable.

37:39.370 --> 37:47.038
And so this is something that has occupied me for quite a while now, and I think I can go more, you know, all sales set,

37:47.423 --> 37:54.250
into this kind of mode.

37:54.490 --> 37:55.171
That's great.

37:55.191 --> 38:00.877
It comes to Shihara Zai's character all the time, presenting a story about himself.

38:00.917 --> 38:01.638
Absolutely.

38:01.718 --> 38:10.087
I wonder, and what's the truth, and what is it, and does it matter?

38:10.107 --> 38:10.907
I mean... Does it matter?

38:10.927 --> 38:11.688
That's the question.

38:11.708 --> 38:15.372
Simple point is that facts hardly ever matter unless you can transform them into a kind of mythical truth.

38:16.381 --> 38:20.145
And that is what really concerns me deeply.

38:20.165 --> 38:44.111
Do you see your work, the 12 novels, and even the other works that you've discussed for me as a corpus, as a body of work that is best, even though we're probably in mid-career right now, and I asked this to Nadine Gortimer, you know, is it a corpus?

38:44.131 --> 38:45.292
She says, absolutely.

38:45.312 --> 38:46.033
She said,

38:46.655 --> 39:15.075
fascinating location she said she says all of her books she compared it with going into a into an exhibition room and looking at a sculpture and it's one sculpture and every book is almost a different view of walking around and looking at the same piece from different angles and i wonder you know that's a wonderful metaphor it's like the old elliott thing every every attempt is a holy new start and a different kind of failure

39:18.785 --> 39:28.414
And it is no truism, but I think for that very reason there is a fair amount of truth in it, that every writer spends his whole life through the writing of one book.

39:29.114 --> 39:47.070
And you try it from this angle, and either it doesn't work, or it doesn't go far enough, or for the moment it is okay, but then you discover more in yourself that has to go into that, so you approach it from another angle, from the inside, from wherever.

39:48.400 --> 40:03.448
reconstruct the edifice.

40:03.468 --> 40:07.135
Are you also a firm believer, I mean, you've written so many books that are so important to your country, to their history, and reflect what was going on in your country at this time?

40:07.655 --> 40:16.485
Do you believe that all of these books absolutely reflect your development as a writer at a certain time?

40:16.505 --> 40:23.813
I mean, given the chance, like Henry James would go back and rewrite some of these words, you know, pulled around with his poetry and made them worse.

40:23.833 --> 40:30.961
Our own Walt Whitman was constantly revising his works up until the day he died.

40:30.981 --> 40:32.522
How do you feel about that?

40:32.743 --> 40:36.106
Or does a work speak for you at that certain point in your life in his completed work?

40:36.126 --> 40:36.767
I think it's the latter part.

40:38.283 --> 40:51.782
Sometimes I have to go back for one reason or another to one of my old books when a film company gets interested or whether a new edition is prepared.

40:52.163 --> 40:54.126
Are you ever tempted?

40:54.146 --> 41:04.020
I have been tempted on a few occasions but then immediately I would realize it would become a totally different book and to do it halfway or half-heartedly

41:04.675 --> 41:11.763
That's not the way to do it.

41:11.904 --> 41:27.963
Either you leave it as it is, make a few tiny little, uh, stylistic changes here and there, or you rewrite the whole thing and I definitely don't.

41:27.983 --> 41:30.025
Then I'd rather write a new novel and try and revisit the same problematic in a totally different way.

41:32.317 --> 41:43.432
as you finish yours.

41:43.452 --> 41:53.205
Your character and her companion in Paris have a shared passion for Shakespeare.

41:53.265 --> 41:55.428
The Shakespeare passion of yours?

41:55.788 --> 41:56.129
Absolutely.

41:56.149 --> 41:56.970
My great Jordan Patrick.

41:57.010 --> 42:01.556
I've just published in South Africa a small book on Shakespeare.

42:01.576 --> 42:01.716
Mm-hmm.

42:02.168 --> 42:10.808
And I hope to extend it into a proper full-length, several hundred-page study in the near future.

42:10.828 --> 42:11.490
I didn't know this.

42:11.510 --> 42:17.764
I just sensed it from the... I really... I think it goes back to my mother.

42:20.579 --> 42:48.055
At a time, and in circumstances, when Afrikaans was the language of every little town in which we lived, and the whole culture was absolutely drenched in the tradition of Afrikanadom, but she had grown up, although she was Afrikaans-speaking, she'd grown up in a part of the country where English was more common.

42:49.402 --> 42:56.575
From early youth, she had a passion for literature, especially for Dickens and Shakespeare.

42:56.595 --> 43:06.493
So from a fairly early stage, she inculcated this into us and also introduced one day a week of English speaking at home.

43:07.875 --> 43:13.165
And if we lapsed into Afrikaans, you would get a bad mark, the one with fewest bad marks at the end of a month.

43:13.465 --> 43:19.217
got a shilling which in those days was wealth.

43:19.237 --> 43:30.040
So for mercy and other reasons I had learnt English and very early discovered Shakespeare and I've just been doting on him ever since.

43:30.560 --> 43:39.256
I don't know if you have going on in your country now what's going on here.

43:39.276 --> 43:41.380
It's called the Canon Wars.

43:44.426 --> 43:46.009
It's a battle over what works into the literary camp.

43:46.029 --> 43:46.269
Oh, yes.

43:46.289 --> 43:47.051
And Genby's book, as a matter of fact.

43:47.071 --> 43:47.151
Yes.

43:47.131 --> 44:06.449
addresses itself to this.

44:06.469 --> 44:09.712
There are people who say that they call them dead white European males.

44:09.732 --> 44:11.073
Why should we read Shakespeare, Sir Heinke's, Tolstoy?

44:11.994 --> 44:12.594
What would we be without them?

44:12.614 --> 44:13.776
I am mind-boggling that this should even be an issue.

44:13.796 --> 44:14.016
Absolutely.

44:14.036 --> 44:15.417
I think the danger enters into it when one reads them exclusively and

44:16.088 --> 44:37.000
I think one should always be very elastic in one's approach to this, that this canon is being added to over time and in recent years I think the greatest writers in the English language, thank you, have really come from

44:37.537 --> 44:50.428
what used to be the frontiers of the empire, from India and Rushdie, from South Africa and Jane Kutze, from Canada and Atwood, you know, you can go on.

44:51.430 --> 44:56.001
Of course, there are great writers in America and there are some good writers in England.

44:56.656 --> 45:20.749
But I think the really exciting renewal of the language and the literature happens from the frontiers, England.

45:20.769 --> 45:22.491
And English is such a resilient language that it allows us to be used by so many days.

45:22.511 --> 45:23.032
I think we did right here.

45:23.052 --> 45:23.853
I think the salmon was a good choice.

45:23.873 --> 45:23.953
Yes.

45:23.973 --> 45:24.454
It looks very succulent.

45:24.474 --> 45:25.195
Sometimes it tends to be a good guy.

45:26.272 --> 45:39.066
During the apartheid years, inevitably, I was regarded, usually when I travelled abroad, I did a lot of travelling, as almost primarily a political commentator.

45:39.487 --> 45:52.041
And I was deeply aware of the kind of responsibility one incurs when you write about a situation like that, and you've got to try and interpret the country when you have the opportunity.

45:52.061 --> 45:54.844
But many people tended to forget that I was a fiction writer,

45:55.668 --> 46:24.561
and now with apartheid moral is gone and excellent politicians in place to speak for themselves I just find it an exhilaration to to become only a writer only a writer is already more than one can handle um

46:24.878 --> 46:51.229
We talked about that you are, by temperament, and certainly the results of what you've produced over your career attest to it.

46:51.249 --> 46:51.950
You're a fiction writer by Merrill.

46:51.970 --> 46:52.330
The circumstances.

46:52.350 --> 46:52.631
What happened?

46:52.651 --> 46:54.272
Could you have written fiction and withdrawn yourself from the political climate?

46:54.293 --> 46:54.353
No.

46:54.373 --> 46:54.733
No, it was just...

46:55.304 --> 47:23.556
from that time in Paris when I made the decision to come back to South Africa you see the background to that is that I had lived in Paris previously I studied Paris for two years from 59 to 61 and that was a shocking experience jolting me out of all the comfortable assumptions I had

47:24.548 --> 47:40.624
just taken for granted previously, coming from a very conservative Afrikaner background, supporters of the National Party, very religious.

47:40.905 --> 47:47.912
And Paris, perhaps because it coincided with Sharpeville in 1960, just broke down all of that.

47:48.012 --> 47:50.654
But I couldn't stay on longer.

47:50.674 --> 47:52.176
My money simply ran out.

47:52.898 --> 47:59.812
to start building something new in the place of everything I dismantled.

47:59.832 --> 48:06.946
And when I went back to South Africa late in 61, it was very resentful.

48:07.046 --> 48:08.109
I really bore the place a grudge.

48:08.269 --> 48:09.571
I didn't want to be there.

48:09.732 --> 48:12.557
I thought of South Africa as a kind of poor relative.

48:12.638 --> 48:13.860
I was embarrassed by it.

48:15.629 --> 48:18.692
It sounds like your character here to some degree.

48:18.712 --> 48:19.172
Yes.

48:19.212 --> 48:25.038
Well, one keeps on drawing on one's own experiences.

48:25.058 --> 48:25.478
I'm sorry?

48:25.719 --> 48:26.679
No, no, no, not at all.

48:27.921 --> 48:35.248
For about ten years, what I wrote after my return, those books were set in Paris.

48:36.429 --> 48:41.974
With the exception of one, they were not translated into English.

48:42.241 --> 48:47.290
I didn't want to write about South Africa, I just didn't think it was interesting enough.

48:47.750 --> 48:54.923
But when I went back the second time after 68, that was a conscious decision to go back.

48:54.943 --> 49:05.160
And I realized then that if I had to compete with writers and the rest of the world, and thank God I don't think writers need to compete,

49:06.845 --> 49:14.673
then the only thing that I could offer which was different from theirs was South Africa, was my roots as an Afrikaner.

49:16.075 --> 49:23.062
And suddenly this became so fascinating, even though I continued to loathe much of what I saw around it.

49:23.082 --> 49:30.911
And I was horror-struck by the more and more I discovered about the Afrikaner past.

49:30.931 --> 49:32.953
But I also discovered some wonderful things.

49:33.895 --> 49:49.170
And the main thing was that I was fascinated by the whole process through which something develops from roots to through tree trunk to through branches to flowers.

49:50.905 --> 50:12.752
Here in this country, during the years of slavery, there was a crime for a black person to know how to read.

50:12.772 --> 50:12.912
Really?

50:12.932 --> 50:13.413
Yeah, there was a crime.

50:13.433 --> 50:14.094
And there were laws on the books.

50:14.114 --> 50:14.754
I mean, you could be imprisoned.

50:14.774 --> 50:14.875
What?

50:14.895 --> 50:15.095
Of course.

50:15.115 --> 50:15.936
I mean, we're going back 130 years or so.

50:15.956 --> 50:16.597
Yeah, but it's not all that far.

50:16.617 --> 50:17.097
That's not all that far.

50:17.117 --> 50:18.499
In fact, in Manuel's book, he mentions the law, and he cites the law.

50:18.479 --> 50:28.238
which I wish I'd had for my book.

50:28.739 --> 50:34.911
If you found the law, I wish I'd been alerted to find it myself.

50:34.931 --> 50:38.398
But in your country, of course, it was a criminal offense, but yet your books were banned.

50:38.418 --> 50:39.981
You were told that what you were writing was, what, dangerous?

50:40.332 --> 50:48.343
Subversive.

50:52.168 --> 50:56.133
Subversive.

50:57.855 --> 50:58.175
And communistic.

50:58.195 --> 51:00.278
And blasphemous.

51:00.298 --> 51:00.639
And pornographic.

51:00.659 --> 51:01.360
Did you feel physically threatened?

51:01.380 --> 51:01.660
Yes.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.322
Or was it intellectually threatened?

51:03.342 --> 51:04.764
No, the banning of a book was really only the starting point.

51:04.784 --> 51:07.808
Because if a book was banned and they regarded you as a threat to the security of the state, that time hallowed phrase,

51:08.935 --> 51:32.872
It meant that the security police took an active interest in you and I would be under constant surveillance and sometimes my house would be searched or I would be interrogated by the police and they would confiscate my manuscripts and even my typewriters just to make it difficult to operate.

51:32.892 --> 51:33.873
Would they be returned or they would not?

51:33.894 --> 51:34.875
Eventually they were returned after about a year.

51:38.011 --> 51:48.484
And even when I went abroad, when I went to Europe or to Britain, I would always be followed, even abroad.

51:48.504 --> 51:55.113
And my mail was intercepted and my phone was tapped until the clerk was in office.

51:55.133 --> 52:00.460
In fact, I wrote him a specific letter soon after he had released Mandela.

52:00.480 --> 52:07.849
We'd been together at university, the clerk and I, which is why I can't stand the man.

52:08.453 --> 52:15.067
But, by the way, I wrote him a letter saying I'm going to Europe very soon.

52:15.087 --> 52:18.114
And it was just after Mandela came from prison.

52:18.174 --> 52:25.450
And I know that many journalists are going to ask me about what has changed in South Africa.

52:26.611 --> 52:41.392
So I told him in this letter, how do you expect me to tell them with an honest conscience that things have changed if in my own personal situation my mail is still intercepted and my phone is still tapped?

52:43.155 --> 52:48.683
And then he wrote back saying, I'll ask the police to investigate, which I thought was beautiful.

52:49.143 --> 52:53.209
But the interesting thing was that he did stop after that.

52:54.117 --> 53:17.550
as far as I could tell, because previously they'd done it in such obvious, ostentatious ways that one couldn't miss it.

53:17.570 --> 53:18.852
But since then, I have the impression that they discontinued it.

53:18.872 --> 53:19.833
If they're doing it, they're doing it very well.

53:19.853 --> 53:21.376
I mean, well, in the sense that efficiently, in a way that you want to work.

53:21.396 --> 53:22.437
Did you have a fear for your perception, for your...

53:23.429 --> 53:34.871
Well, they were risky, you know.

53:34.891 --> 53:37.897
There were many death threats, you know, anonymous phone calls and letters and things.

53:37.917 --> 53:39.480
Once there was an attack on my house, my car would be sabotaged.

53:40.068 --> 53:55.245
and get letters to threaten the lives of my children.

53:55.265 --> 53:56.166
That is tough.

53:56.186 --> 54:00.050
But there were times when I came close to deciding that for the sake of my family I would have to leave.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.413
But I'm just so glad I never did because to be there and to look through all of that

54:03.490 --> 54:16.943
And so where we are today has just been an incredible adventure.

54:16.963 --> 54:20.626
Did you expect it in the right time?

54:20.646 --> 54:20.846
No.

54:20.867 --> 54:22.948
That's an amazement, isn't it?

54:22.968 --> 54:23.389
It remains a miracle.

54:23.409 --> 54:29.835
And even if sometimes one saw signs that it couldn't go on for much longer, then the impression was that

54:30.457 --> 54:44.904
There would have to be some great cataclysmic event, a total sort of revolution, bloodshed, whatever.

54:44.924 --> 54:48.450
And we got through with it with very little, comparatively very little violence.

54:48.470 --> 54:53.680
At the moment the country is having, experiencing much more violence than ever before, but it's criminal violence as in Russia.

54:54.115 --> 55:16.848
as opposed to political.

55:16.868 --> 55:17.689
Well, that's what you have to go through.

55:17.709 --> 55:18.030
I'm afraid, sir.

55:18.050 --> 55:19.251
I remember what's going on in Russia is momentum, of course.

55:19.271 --> 55:20.233
I don't know how self-effort prepares to Russia.

55:20.253 --> 55:21.234
One wonders if democracy would survive in Russia.

55:21.254 --> 55:21.775
It's really touching down.

55:21.795 --> 55:22.055
It really is.

55:22.076 --> 55:23.698
If anybody thinks that the nuclear threat is gone, it will be held forever.

55:23.718 --> 55:23.818
Yeah.

55:24.271 --> 55:37.099
I think I'll just turn this tape on the other side.
