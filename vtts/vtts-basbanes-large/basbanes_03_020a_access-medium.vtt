WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:05.220
Make sure we're rolling.

00:06.201 --> 00:06.962
Yeah, we're rolling.

00:07.103 --> 00:07.663
Isn't that cool?

00:07.683 --> 00:08.905
It's so small.

00:08.925 --> 00:09.345
I know.

00:09.365 --> 00:09.886
Okay, number one.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.328
And just don't even think about it.

00:11.348 --> 00:11.969
I want it.

00:12.029 --> 00:13.671
I'm actually used to being taped.

00:13.751 --> 00:16.775
I'll check it periodically to make sure everything's going okay, which it is.

00:17.756 --> 00:22.442
And so your publishing director, why don't we just start and tell me what a publishing director does.

00:22.462 --> 00:25.125
Oh, that's like the hardest question you could possibly ask me.

00:25.606 --> 00:26.527
Everything else is easy.

00:26.947 --> 00:28.249
It's actually a...

00:29.326 --> 00:33.013
It was a job that was sort of created for me, or, you know, as I rolled along.

00:33.053 --> 00:35.437
I don't know that... What did you roll along doing?

00:35.457 --> 00:36.219
What kind of stuff?

00:36.239 --> 00:38.503
Well, let me give you just, I'll just give you the biggest history.

00:38.523 --> 00:40.868
It was when I first joined Yale University.

00:40.888 --> 00:41.369
In 71.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.190
In 71, that's right.

00:42.210 --> 00:49.123
It was one of my first jobs out of college, and I just was interested in publishing, so I started in the sales department.

00:49.357 --> 00:50.018
And you went where?

00:50.158 --> 00:50.538
To school?

00:50.638 --> 00:52.620
I had graduated with a B.A.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.262
in art history from Smith College.

00:54.362 --> 00:59.967
My daughter graduated from Smith College two years ago with a degree in French and art history.

00:59.987 --> 01:04.232
Art history was like, you know, at the time I went, you know, Smith was great.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.554
So it was interesting at them.

01:06.594 --> 01:10.538
And at the time I started here, I knew they did art books, and I liked that part of it.

01:10.598 --> 01:16.984
But the art book part was, you know, just one of the many lists they did, not particularly big.

01:17.335 --> 01:22.402
And the whole growth of that was particularly interesting to me because I actually loved the books and I knew some of the people.

01:22.462 --> 01:28.850
And so I think I've had some part in encouraging the editors to expand that and ever expand it.

01:28.870 --> 01:29.771
It's quite a great success story.

01:29.791 --> 01:30.872
Yeah, it is actually.

01:31.133 --> 01:45.351
And it is actually, as a part of our list, interesting, you know, the whole history of Yale University Press starts from, you know, being a university press that wasn't that much different from

01:45.550 --> 01:47.332
than other university presses.

01:47.873 --> 01:55.503
And if you think about it, a small university press at the time, we were bigger than other university presses at the time, but when you think about it now, we were very small.

01:55.864 --> 02:00.149
And so we had a small staff, everybody multitasked, we had a small list.

02:00.490 --> 02:02.232
Are you talking about from the beginning or when you came in?

02:02.312 --> 02:03.093
From when I came in.

02:03.273 --> 02:04.214
So it was pretty small then.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.116
It was pretty small.

02:05.136 --> 02:12.966
I mean, they didn't think of themselves as small then, but if I think of its size then and its size now, it is apples and oranges.

02:12.986 --> 02:14.528
It was totally different.

02:14.913 --> 02:18.118
You know, there were just fewer people we all did more.

02:18.158 --> 02:33.159
Oddly enough, that all the things that were now strengths now and the divisions that we now have, the imprints that John has formalized, all had their roots then and even before that, you know.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.541
And things were different then.

02:34.561 --> 02:35.763
I mean, it was a very different world.

02:35.783 --> 02:41.311
The editions then, which now are something that we're thinking about should be electronic and hardly sell any copies at all.

02:41.852 --> 02:44.295
Then we're like, whenever we had a new Ben Franklin, yay!

02:44.528 --> 02:48.752
You know, that was going to be instant cash, and they were going to sell well, and it was a big deal.

02:48.812 --> 02:50.854
And we had a new Walpole.

02:50.894 --> 02:53.978
We'd go schlep up and see Lefty Lewis, and we'd have a celebration.

02:53.998 --> 02:55.059
I mean, it was a very big deal.

02:55.399 --> 02:57.661
These things now are the same projects.

02:57.721 --> 02:59.023
How can we afford to do these?

02:59.543 --> 03:01.145
And do they need to be electronic now?

03:01.645 --> 03:04.588
So getting back, I will tell you more about my own thing.

03:04.608 --> 03:07.271
So do you have any projects that are strictly electronic?

03:08.372 --> 03:10.114
We have done a couple of things.

03:10.364 --> 03:17.732
that were originally CD-ROMs and now do DVD, but strictly electronic, just without a print version.

03:17.772 --> 03:17.972
Yeah.

03:18.273 --> 03:19.354
We've done one or two.

03:19.494 --> 03:20.015
We have.

03:20.415 --> 03:22.057
And is this just an experimental?

03:22.077 --> 03:22.838
It was experimental.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.040
One was the Perseus thing, and I can explain.

03:25.080 --> 03:25.320
The witch?

03:25.421 --> 03:33.269
Perseus, which we did about ten years ago, and we should get back to that and why we... I actually championed it, because I thought we could do it.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.030
Perseus.

03:34.210 --> 03:34.751
Perseus.

03:34.891 --> 03:36.533
It's a Greek... It's called Perseus.

03:37.254 --> 03:37.654
P-E-R?

03:38.225 --> 03:40.468
P-E-R-S-E-U-S.

03:42.031 --> 03:44.835
And it was all about Greek civilization.

03:44.855 --> 04:06.308
It was supposed to be, and it was, we were just amazed at how much you could put on this CD-ROM, and there was all this information, and in today's world, it's nothing compared to, but it was something we tried, but we are, the whole electronic thing is sort of what we're moving towards, but I think that actually, I think what you might do in the book is

04:06.592 --> 04:13.240
using Yale University Press as an example of a university press and what it can be and still be what it is.

04:14.141 --> 04:17.225
And that would make the book interesting.

04:17.365 --> 04:23.713
I don't even think of my history here as just a history of Yale University Press.

04:24.234 --> 04:26.016
Well, you've been here for one-third of its existence.

04:26.316 --> 04:34.506
I've been here a long time, and I've been here through, I think, some of the years that have shown the most growth and change.

04:34.773 --> 04:38.738
But I think all the seeds were there, and they even predated me.

04:38.978 --> 04:44.284
But when I came here, it was easy to know what Yale University Press had done in the past.

04:44.304 --> 04:46.066
How many titles were they doing a year?

04:46.647 --> 04:48.789
I can get back to you, but I would say 50.

04:48.809 --> 04:52.614
Maybe 80 titles a year.

04:52.654 --> 04:53.735
That's a lot.

04:53.875 --> 04:54.957
But I have some of the catalogs.

04:55.057 --> 04:57.079
I mean, I have statistics somewhere.

04:57.880 --> 05:03.767
And there had been many years where the growth was very incremental.

05:04.118 --> 05:07.321
And there were years, and even when we said we would grow more, we weren't even able to.

05:07.361 --> 05:14.108
We just seemed to get the books out, and through editing and acquired, to increase the size of the list.

05:14.348 --> 05:19.834
We would always start out, and then we would never quite hit as many as we ideally might have wanted to do.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.737
But we always thought we were getting, you know, bigger and bigger.

05:22.797 --> 05:25.880
But it wasn't, the growth was in the past ten years.

05:25.940 --> 05:26.941
It's just been enormous.

05:26.961 --> 05:28.542
So this was an entry-level job?

05:28.602 --> 05:30.244
I took an entry-level job.

05:30.477 --> 05:33.280
And it was basically just publishing and art.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.082
Well, you know, I came in because I needed a job.

05:35.102 --> 05:40.167
I just moved to town with my husband, who was an attorney, and he took a job.

05:40.187 --> 05:41.989
We were in Washington, and I was working in museums.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.374
He took a job in Bridgeport, and I said, that is the place with the snow stacks off the highway.

05:46.534 --> 05:47.655
We're still not living there.

05:47.675 --> 05:48.636
We always drive through it.

05:48.676 --> 05:49.517
I said, we're not living there.

05:49.537 --> 05:50.258
And he said, where are we?

05:50.338 --> 05:52.480
I said, well, you know, I went to Smith, so I knew New Haven.

05:52.981 --> 05:54.963
I said, well, you know, maybe I could get a job at Yale.

05:55.583 --> 05:55.964
Good for you.

05:56.184 --> 06:00.028
So I started at the art gallery and didn't like what I was doing there, and then

06:00.430 --> 06:01.091
I just apply.

06:01.131 --> 06:04.556
I mean, really, what I tell my kids now, just apply, get a foot in the door.

06:05.056 --> 06:08.762
And it was just, I mean, I was, I think I was born to be a publisher.

06:08.862 --> 06:12.006
I mean, I loved every, even the clumsy job that I had.

06:12.427 --> 06:15.531
I just loved the idea of publishing books, and I loved the books.

06:15.611 --> 06:16.452
I knew some of them.

06:17.734 --> 06:28.069
So for me, it was exciting, and I got to deal with Joseph Albers, who, you know, lived in town, and we're publishing Interaction of Color, and it was one of my first projects, you know, so it was fun.

06:28.089 --> 06:28.429
But...

06:28.882 --> 06:37.273
And my first job was coding exam copy requests, which was incredibly tedious, but it taught me the backlist.

06:37.293 --> 06:45.124
So from, like, the get-go, I was really knowing the new book found the backlist, which really taught me a lot very quickly.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.807
And was it 302 Temple then?

06:48.108 --> 06:48.849
It was York Street.

06:49.490 --> 06:52.574
It was whatever it was, York Street, in the old bakery.

06:53.515 --> 06:55.278
And it was so different.

06:55.618 --> 06:58.602
This one big downstairs room where everybody in marketing...

06:59.037 --> 07:01.840
It was located with little partitions, but no offices.

07:01.860 --> 07:11.068
I mean, it was just, and in those days, the printing, I think we had just, or about to disassociate the printing from, you know, we used to print their own books.

07:11.709 --> 07:13.471
So there was a printing office in the back.

07:13.531 --> 07:15.532
It was just, it was so totally different.

07:16.033 --> 07:19.296
I thought it was a big deal, but, you know, from my perspective.

07:19.316 --> 07:20.037
Well, at the time it was.

07:20.217 --> 07:23.480
It was, but, you know, now it seems so quaint.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.783
You know, everybody knew everybody else.

07:26.982 --> 07:34.275
And then a job came open in the promotion department, and I was much more attracted to that.

07:35.257 --> 07:36.279
Publicity promotion?

07:36.359 --> 07:39.965
What I was doing first was direct mail and doing the catalog.

07:39.985 --> 07:41.768
And how long did you do that?

07:42.049 --> 07:42.490
I did that.

07:42.550 --> 07:43.411
Well, I kept adding.

07:43.431 --> 07:47.699
I mean, I still keep... Because I became a book review editor in 1978, and I went to Yale.

07:47.779 --> 07:50.243
I've always been getting Yale books, and I review them every year.

07:50.283 --> 07:50.644
I love them.

07:50.843 --> 07:57.110
And I'm wondering if I ever worked with you back in the... I supervised the publicity people after a couple of years.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.313
Sarah Clark, I think, did a lot of work for me.

07:59.373 --> 08:00.254
And she's still here.

08:00.274 --> 08:02.276
And she and I go way back.

08:02.396 --> 08:02.877
Oh, you should.

08:02.897 --> 08:04.339
Well, she would work for me.

08:04.839 --> 08:12.668
I actually, when I was in promotion, so my first thing was I did the catalog and I did direct mail and the big innovation that I made.

08:12.688 --> 08:14.290
Because I had a designer that I worked with.

08:15.011 --> 08:17.534
And I mean, I was making this aesthetic salary.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.277
But I liked the visual end of it and I liked the writing end of it.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.263
And I said, why does our catalog have to look so dull?

08:23.783 --> 08:26.986
Why can't we shorten the copy, add illustrations?

08:27.167 --> 08:29.729
Why do the ads have to look like text?

08:29.909 --> 08:37.177
Believe it or not, the big innovation was to use illustrations more and make things look nicer.

08:37.257 --> 08:38.518
You do a wonderful catalog.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.920
And I see every catalog.

08:41.141 --> 08:46.086
Since I think I started supervising the catalog in 72 or 73, and I used to write it all.

08:46.106 --> 08:50.550
I mean, this is the size of the press, is that I could not only see it through production, but I wrote the copy.

08:51.188 --> 08:53.270
And we now have somebody who does nothing but write copies.

08:53.350 --> 08:54.611
And I wrote the copy.

08:54.791 --> 09:04.841
And the other big innovation I made at the time was telling the editors, resting away writing copies from the editors, who wrote a copy that was not appearing.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.222
He was too academic.

09:06.242 --> 09:07.924
So I did the catalog.

09:07.984 --> 09:12.028
And then we had this big purge through a couple of bad years.

09:12.188 --> 09:14.490
And the staff was reduced.

09:14.510 --> 09:17.833
And I was not fired, but I was given more responsibility.

09:17.853 --> 09:19.575
So I took on advertising.

09:19.893 --> 09:29.021
Or, you know, I decided to advertise, direct bail, exhibits, publicism, and then, you know, just Chester just kept adding things to me.

09:29.041 --> 09:29.982
And I had staff.

09:30.903 --> 09:41.492
And at first it was a tiny staff, but then it grew, and I started just making people specialize in various areas as the number of books increased and as we changed our focus.

09:41.512 --> 09:48.718
So I can tell you about the growth and how we did marketing, but it went from just when I took it on, I thought it was incredibly...

09:48.952 --> 09:50.955
And we did so little publicity.

09:51.515 --> 09:54.199
And then we hired a publicist named Anne Emanuel.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.081
She worked for me.

09:56.101 --> 10:05.753
And then, you know, we just, and then Sarah came on and, you know, and then we, you know, we really increased the staff.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.195
And we specialized until now.

10:07.756 --> 10:09.819
I've actually made them three separate departments.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.462
One is promotion, one is publicity, and one is sales.

10:12.931 --> 10:18.339
Which is really something for University Press to have a promotion at a publicity department, I guess.

10:18.499 --> 10:19.020
Not so much.

10:19.040 --> 10:19.941
I mean, not so much.

10:19.961 --> 10:23.486
I mean, in general, I mean, you know, because University Press, it is a world that's very liberal.

10:23.506 --> 10:24.407
Well, more and more.

10:24.788 --> 10:35.122
And actually, in our publicity department, I think in the past even three years, is the one I, and maybe five, have expanded the most, because that's where it all happens.

10:35.343 --> 10:41.892
And then, you know, if we ever got a review in the New York Times book review, I mean, we practically broke out the champagne.

10:42.243 --> 10:47.951
You know, and now my level of expectation is we should always, you know, there should always be several, more than several a year.

10:48.512 --> 10:49.654
So it was very different, you know.

10:49.714 --> 10:53.039
I mean, it was sweet, you know, when I think back about it.

10:53.319 --> 11:04.175
And I remember then we had this, when I first joined, I thought it was so male-dominated, and all the leaders, all the senior positions were men, and they all had two first names.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.660
And I remember coming home and saying to my husband, I said,

11:08.450 --> 11:14.996
Everybody has two first dates, Pratt, Chester Kerr, you know, and they wear coats with little velvet combs.

11:15.077 --> 11:16.998
I said, I'm from the Upper West Side of New York.

11:17.018 --> 11:18.300
I am so out of place here.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.162
This is like, who are these people?

11:20.182 --> 11:26.968
They dress funny, you know, they have, and women, and I remember I wore flax to work one day.

11:26.988 --> 11:27.609
Did they raise eyebrows?

11:28.230 --> 11:33.715
They were such a hoo-ha, and there was this guy, John Burrell, who used to be...

11:34.117 --> 11:41.750
It was kind of an important idea, but he was a lovely man who sort of served the lunches and brought around a coffee cart and da-da-da.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.113
And he said, he was a great guy.

11:44.174 --> 11:46.598
He knew more about the people than anybody.

11:47.159 --> 11:52.708
And he said, you know, at Yale University Press, women don't wear pants.

11:52.728 --> 11:55.973
And I being, you know, this brash young thing said they do now.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.452
Was this early?

11:57.592 --> 11:58.433
This was right away.

11:59.434 --> 12:00.255
You'll never last.

12:00.355 --> 12:01.036
That was a big deal.

12:01.056 --> 12:02.178
It was such a big deal.

12:02.198 --> 12:12.912
When I went to work for my newspaper in 71, and this is a newsroom, there was a woman, a reporter, because I was fresh out of the service at that point myself, and I was like, boy, I was really amazed.

12:12.932 --> 12:16.397
This gal's wearing, she looked great.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.920
I couldn't believe that this was going to be such a hoo-ha.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.083
What kind of place is this, you know?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.475
So nobody ever told you not to?

12:23.495 --> 12:27.019
Nobody ever told me I couldn't, but it raised eyebrows, and then other women did.

12:27.139 --> 12:27.919
And they get used to it?

12:28.480 --> 12:29.281
No, yeah.

12:29.301 --> 12:30.442
How many women were here?

12:30.462 --> 12:32.063
You know, it'd be interesting to know the breakdown.

12:32.083 --> 12:32.924
There were a lot of women.

12:32.944 --> 12:41.412
There were always a lot of women, but there were no women, and there were some women editors who had fairly high positions.

12:41.433 --> 12:44.195
You should talk to Marion Ash and Jane Isay.

12:45.036 --> 12:45.817
They're still around?

12:45.837 --> 12:46.217
Jane is.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.458
Jane left here.

12:47.759 --> 12:49.180
Marion, I-O-N?

12:49.278 --> 12:52.062
Marion O-N, I think.

12:52.082 --> 12:52.583
Ash, A-S-H.

12:52.603 --> 12:53.204
Maybe A-S.

12:53.865 --> 12:59.494
Marion and Neil Ash, A-S-H, no E. And the other woman?

12:59.634 --> 13:04.181
Marion lives in Bethany, and she's still, she was a brilliant political science editor.

13:04.581 --> 13:16.720
And Jane Isay, who actually is my best friend to the day, I-S-A-Y, was a young editor who was building the psychology and philosophy with

13:17.054 --> 13:28.908
and doing some trade books and lawless, and she created... Chester was really very instrumental in saying that a university press could do a trade book and a general interest book.

13:30.089 --> 13:32.051
So you think he really was the one who got that going?

13:32.251 --> 13:33.493
I think he got that going.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.615
What were some of the earliest successes there?

13:36.016 --> 13:39.720
Well, the biggest success, the one that made the New York Times Book Review,

13:39.953 --> 13:44.940
And actually, after you do your research, you'll remind me of the timing of these things.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.583
Oh, I wouldn't know where you're just going.

13:46.603 --> 13:49.126
It was called, what was it called?

13:49.146 --> 13:59.982
It was by a guy who had been in the Secret Service, the M2 or whatever it was, in England, and it was called The Double Cross System or something.

14:00.002 --> 14:07.513
And it was sort of a memoir of espionage after the war, and Chester...

14:08.472 --> 14:12.918
It was a very bold thing to do, and we published it as a trade book.

14:12.938 --> 14:14.399
We did the impeachment book.

14:15.761 --> 14:22.229
And Chester was the original publicist.

14:22.710 --> 14:26.875
In the days when we hardly had a publicity department, Chester knew everybody in New York.

14:27.776 --> 14:29.558
And he would go to the Times himself.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.726
He had a knack for generating publicity.

14:36.487 --> 14:37.348
He wasn't a nice man.

14:37.750 --> 14:38.231
I'm sorry?

14:38.251 --> 14:39.172
He wasn't a nice man.

14:39.192 --> 14:41.295
Yeah, I've heard conflicting things about him.

14:41.435 --> 14:47.044
But I'll give him a lot of credit, though I disagreed with him a lot.

14:47.064 --> 14:48.005
He promoted me a lot.

14:49.027 --> 14:51.570
But he treated women who treated not well here.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.434
Ed Morgan did not have nice things.

14:54.454 --> 14:55.436
He was not a nice man.

14:55.716 --> 15:01.665
But I will credit him with giving, putting Yale Press on the map.

15:02.253 --> 15:04.416
And he would do adventures in projects.

15:04.436 --> 15:05.497
He did this in the map.

15:05.638 --> 15:11.766
He knew how to operate in New York World, which most university press directors did not know.

15:11.806 --> 15:13.208
And I learned a lot from him.

15:13.248 --> 15:16.993
He was very aggressive about advertising and publicity.

15:17.033 --> 15:20.157
Some of it was self-aggrandizing, admittedly.

15:21.038 --> 15:25.284
But he did a great, you know, he really knew how to do that.

15:25.704 --> 15:27.927
Oh, John, you said, you know, depressing thing why.

15:27.947 --> 15:28.608
Oh, definitely.

15:28.668 --> 15:31.332
You know, and if you didn't agree with Chester, you were really out of here.

15:31.447 --> 15:38.438
Yeah, except for, you know, if you were, he really admired my gumption.

15:38.478 --> 15:44.247
I really went up against him often, because I would tell him I thought he treated people badly.

15:45.949 --> 15:47.311
Didn't bother him.

15:47.331 --> 15:56.225
It didn't, because he knew it, you know, but he was less, and also I think he was less threatened by, I mean, a young woman wasn't going to get very far.

15:56.646 --> 15:57.507
But he kept annoying me.

15:57.527 --> 15:58.909
He really gave me a lot of responsibility.

15:58.929 --> 16:00.171
He paid me terribly.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.922
Always?

16:02.623 --> 16:03.043
Always.

16:03.965 --> 16:10.754
Well, I always got raises mysteriously, and I always knew that the reason I got a raise mysteriously was because some young man with less experience had just been hired.

16:10.794 --> 16:14.419
Probably for more money, too.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.142
Just a kick, isn't it?

16:16.182 --> 16:18.905
I have two daughters, so I'm very sympathetic.

16:18.966 --> 16:21.008
I mean, this was a very sexist environment.

16:21.429 --> 16:26.496
I mean, I have done very well in it, and I don't think it's that way now.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.724
But when I joined here, it was various sexist environments.

16:29.744 --> 16:30.905
Well, you were one of the pioneers.

16:31.126 --> 16:33.589
And when I got pregnant... Did you realize it at the time?

16:34.049 --> 16:45.384
I realized at the time, because, remember, I came from New York, and clearly, you know, that it's a little bit of a feminist, and Smith is somewhat of a feminist, that women were treated appallingly.

16:45.404 --> 16:53.494
I mean, Smith is... If women do have that... You know, you were encouraged to think that you could do anything a man could do.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.577
So it was... Can I get that?

16:55.597 --> 16:55.977
Uh...

16:56.800 --> 16:58.162
I'm not going here.

16:58.182 --> 17:00.546
I'll just let it go, because then I'll get involved in the BMS.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.852
It was, you know, the men here didn't feel that way.

17:04.972 --> 17:12.524
I mean, I was very aware that it was a sexist environment, and there was a guy in the camping who treated the women there.

17:12.544 --> 17:19.855
I think we have a union to this day, because people, yeah, voted for a union because they didn't feel they were treated well, and they weren't.

17:20.560 --> 17:26.046
And there was a guy who, you know, in some ways I thought I was fond of him, but he was appalling to him.

17:26.106 --> 17:29.190
And he was the head of our business office.

17:29.630 --> 17:43.867
And he once spoke to me so rudely that, and I am not, you know, a confrontational person, but I said, if you ever speak to me or another woman that way again, I'll hold your ass into court so quickly it'll make your head spin.

17:43.887 --> 17:44.908
He just provoked me so much.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.570
And I interrupted you.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.492
You said when you became pregnant, what?

17:48.556 --> 17:52.903
Even when I became pregnant, I got pregnant in 1974.

17:54.105 --> 17:58.632
And when they found out I was pregnant, they said, well, when will you be leaving?

17:59.674 --> 18:02.058
And I said, I won't be.

18:02.158 --> 18:03.240
Were there safeguards then?

18:03.260 --> 18:04.402
Could you take leave?

18:04.602 --> 18:10.972
Well, I had to actually get my husband to find a state statute that said that I could continue to work.

18:11.192 --> 18:12.775
But they made me get a note from my doctor.

18:13.312 --> 18:15.174
Certify that you're pregnant?

18:15.334 --> 18:20.059
No, to certify the fact that I wasn't going to, you know, it wasn't going to kill me to go to work.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.883
You know, and it made everybody... Because those laws are just about coming in around then.

18:23.903 --> 18:30.049
It was just, and then I said, you know, I have the right, there was no maternity leave, but I had the right to take my vacation and my sick time.

18:30.069 --> 18:32.251
There was no maternity leave?

18:32.271 --> 18:40.339
But I had the right was you could take sick leave, and you could take vacation, and I think you could go leave.

18:40.439 --> 18:43.302
I never had to go without pay because I came back so soon.

18:43.636 --> 18:47.543
But across the board, everybody was appalled.

18:48.465 --> 18:51.831
A pregnant woman actually worked through her delivery day.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.033
I was here on my delivery day.

18:53.935 --> 18:54.676
I was two weeks late.

18:54.696 --> 18:56.219
I was in the office that morning.

18:57.842 --> 18:58.363
Three times.

18:58.524 --> 18:59.305
Well, you can do it.

18:59.345 --> 19:02.291
I mean, the bottom line, people do it all the time now.

19:02.812 --> 19:06.859
But it was such a hassle, and there was so much opposition.

19:07.126 --> 19:11.931
Chester, in a way, almost not more than anybody else, but kind of surprised.

19:12.011 --> 19:15.575
But he's that kind of guy that he admired somebody's gumption to do that.

19:15.995 --> 19:20.780
But just to show you how backward it was, it was, you know, they were amazed.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.885
But Chester liked kids, so, you know, occasionally I'd bring my babies in.

19:25.645 --> 19:26.206
How many children?

19:26.907 --> 19:29.629
I had, as a matter of fact, there's a great story.

19:29.950 --> 19:30.430
I have three.

19:31.011 --> 19:36.897
So I had the one, I came back, and then we did this annual meeting once a year, which was in 19...

19:37.282 --> 19:44.038
We did an annual meeting of AAUP here in New Haven, and Jane and I were the co-chairs.

19:45.261 --> 19:51.195
And I remember at the last dinner, I was feeling so sick.

19:51.836 --> 19:54.362
So I went to the doctor, and afterward we had this lunch.

19:54.612 --> 20:01.103
after the whole thing was over, Chester, this is the kind of person you would say, you and Jane did a great job.

20:01.143 --> 20:05.390
She was in charge of the program, and I was in charge of the local arrangements or something.

20:05.971 --> 20:07.334
He said, you did a great job.

20:07.354 --> 20:09.678
He says, now you could get pregnant again if you wanted.

20:09.698 --> 20:11.941
And it so happened, I was.

20:12.923 --> 20:16.169
And then I went to the doctor, and I couldn't, I would never have told somebody that early.

20:16.629 --> 20:19.354
And I went back to them the next day, and they said, okay, Chester, did it.

20:19.553 --> 20:20.554
He said, but I said, I'm pregnant.

20:20.574 --> 20:23.879
And he said, you know, I didn't really mean to take it that seriously.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.647
But by that time, I have to say that he still thought it was weird.

20:30.067 --> 20:41.022
But it was amazing to me as a young woman that there could be so much opposition and such discomfort to the fact that women would have a career and a family.

20:41.356 --> 20:42.858
And it wasn't just the men.

20:42.998 --> 20:46.444
I mean, there were women here who were just appalled.

20:46.884 --> 20:56.999
So you work in just about every facet of, uh... So I did everything in marketing at some, and I kept expanding, and the list kept expanding, and our budgets kept expanding, and I was given more staff.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.182
And so then I went, you know, for promotion.

20:59.202 --> 21:00.504
I was the promotion manager.

21:00.524 --> 21:09.017
I was direct mail manager, then promotion manager, then marketing manager, then marketing director, then the first woman associate director of the press.

21:09.132 --> 21:11.515
And at that time, I was the only associate director.

21:11.555 --> 21:12.055
I'll look it up.

21:12.636 --> 21:16.020
I was the only associate director at that point.

21:16.040 --> 21:27.733
I was assistant director, then made associate director, and then made, about ten years ago, publishing director to clarify the fact that I was not just doing marketing then.

21:27.773 --> 21:29.054
I was working with editors.

21:29.134 --> 21:30.576
I was working with the London office.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.199
I was doing a lot of the number crunching.

21:33.550 --> 21:37.874
And when you went to Smith, you never knew you'd be into publishing?

21:37.894 --> 21:40.216
No, I actually thought I would work in museums.

21:41.257 --> 21:51.466
And do you think that, because you've been around the business now for almost thirty-five years, thirty-four years, is this something that would have the same appeal for you, do you think, say, in a trade press in New York?

21:51.486 --> 21:54.649
Or is there something special about this dynamic here?

21:54.709 --> 21:57.832
You know, I think I would have enjoyed trade publishing, too.

21:57.852 --> 22:03.557
I mean, I think that I am just, I love the idea of books.

22:04.010 --> 22:14.280
I love, what I like about academic publishing is I like the challenge of finding a target market for a book, and so many of our books are target markets.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.662
You know, there's an academic discipline.

22:16.862 --> 22:19.304
I like, it's been like going to graduate school.

22:19.324 --> 22:23.328
I mean, I've read in so many areas, and for a long time I read every single book.

22:23.548 --> 22:24.229
Read and learned.

22:24.249 --> 22:25.330
I mean, it's something to read.

22:25.390 --> 22:26.171
And I was interested.

22:26.271 --> 22:27.592
So I loved, you know, psychology.

22:27.612 --> 22:31.536
I learned something about political science, about current events, you know.

22:31.887 --> 22:38.934
Fortunately, politically, Chester and I were on the same page, which was a good thing, I guess, because... You were or you weren't?

22:38.954 --> 22:39.314
We were.

22:39.434 --> 22:39.715
Really?

22:40.095 --> 22:41.136
Yeah, he was a good Democrat.

22:41.156 --> 22:41.617
Was he?

22:41.697 --> 22:42.177
Yeah.

22:42.197 --> 22:43.238
Boy, that's surprising.

22:43.258 --> 22:49.024
It was surprising, but he actually was, you know, in his way, you know.

22:49.084 --> 22:51.226
Very surprising at Yale, I may say so.

22:51.246 --> 23:00.375
He was, well, yeah, he was, um, and he didn't shy away from controversy, you know.

23:00.676 --> 23:05.341
To his credit, I would say that he acted in shy way.

23:05.422 --> 23:06.022
He looked for it.

23:07.985 --> 23:12.990
And he was supportive in some ways, but he wasn't a nice guy.

23:13.051 --> 23:15.794
He hurt a lot of people, and he fired people.

23:15.814 --> 23:22.802
I love you.

23:23.575 --> 23:26.540
And I didn't always agree with him, but I did learn from him.

23:26.561 --> 23:27.843
And he had a very personal approach.

23:27.883 --> 23:31.229
And he did some things like he would bring people in to talk to the staff.

23:32.051 --> 23:35.938
I remember he brought George Bush in when George Bush was at the CIA.

23:36.900 --> 23:37.661
And he came in.

23:37.741 --> 23:39.404
This is an amazing story.

23:39.444 --> 23:40.226
Yeah, I like to hear that.

23:40.266 --> 23:40.827
He came in.

23:41.168 --> 23:41.989
He gave a talk.

23:42.442 --> 23:48.451
This is Herbert Walker, the father who was the director of the CIA.

23:48.792 --> 23:50.354
This is long before he becomes president.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.257
This is the first George Bush.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.219
George Herbert Walker.

23:53.299 --> 24:00.710
He was at the CIA at the time, and Chester, because we had done this double-cross system.

24:01.211 --> 24:02.513
That was the first entry.

24:02.593 --> 24:09.023
He kind of came in and he was talking, you know, so Chester had this interest in spies, blah, blah, blah, and he knew him, he came in.

24:09.391 --> 24:12.314
He was so unimpressive, I can't begin to tell you.

24:12.374 --> 24:12.854
Unimpressive.

24:12.874 --> 24:13.355
Unimpressive.

24:13.715 --> 24:16.258
And all I remembered from him, I said, here's this guy to see him.

24:16.338 --> 24:19.922
And he was talking about the importance of maps to the CIA.

24:19.942 --> 24:20.182
Bush was.

24:20.522 --> 24:21.023
Bush was.

24:21.443 --> 24:29.571
And I remember Jane and I, who were very, you know, hindered spirits, and she sort of took me under her wing, and she sort of mentored me.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.774
And we sat up and said, can you believe that guy?

24:33.315 --> 24:33.956
He's talking.

24:34.336 --> 24:37.339
All this stuff going on in the world, and he's talking about the importance of maps?

24:37.994 --> 24:41.159
Well, this is the guy who didn't tell you how much a gallon of milk cost, either.

24:41.319 --> 24:42.842
I know.

24:42.902 --> 24:43.723
It was amazing.

24:43.803 --> 24:46.768
But he would bring in, oh, my favorite story.

24:47.248 --> 24:57.564
He once brought Alfred Knopf in, who was a friend of his, and he gave us a talk, and then he said, and I was like a junior, junior with this beat-up car, and he said, could you take Alfred Knopf to the train station?

24:58.686 --> 24:59.307
Who this is?

24:59.327 --> 25:01.751
Chester said, because I'm busy, and I said, I'll be happy to.

25:01.771 --> 25:03.073
So I put him in my car, and

25:03.323 --> 25:08.028
He sits down and he goes, ow, and he sat on one of my son's dinosaurs, the plastic dinosaurs.

25:08.068 --> 25:13.213
And I came back and said, I was so mortified that Alfred Knopf sat down on a dinosaur.

25:13.233 --> 25:14.374
Was he nice?

25:14.394 --> 25:14.915
He was fabulous.

25:14.935 --> 25:17.357
But he didn't, he wasn't put off above being?

25:17.377 --> 25:18.498
No, he thought it was funny.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.820
And I, you know, he thought I was a kid.

25:19.860 --> 25:20.400
I was a kid.

25:20.721 --> 25:21.702
You know, and I was like.

25:21.922 --> 25:23.263
Every train station is just down here.

25:23.283 --> 25:25.726
And I was Alfred Knopf, you know, in my car, you know.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.148
That's funny.

25:28.508 --> 25:30.330
I was absolutely, and that was a great thing.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.132
And Chester would have dinner parties, and he and

25:32.450 --> 25:36.011
For some reason, he would include me, even though I was such a junior.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.123
Well, you were a woman, though.

25:38.288 --> 25:42.073
You think there was an element of tokenism in it?

25:42.353 --> 25:49.682
Yeah, it was a tokenism, and occasionally if he had a Jewish author, he was entertaining.

25:50.183 --> 25:51.665
He dragged me out.

25:51.725 --> 25:56.491
And one time I said to John, we're going to a very high-level dinner, and I said, I can't understand why I'm included.

25:57.212 --> 25:59.274
And then there was somebody there, and I said, ah.

25:59.314 --> 25:59.675
I got it.

26:00.215 --> 26:00.596
Uh-huh.

26:00.616 --> 26:03.199
I mean, the tokenism was so there.

26:04.140 --> 26:04.701
But hey.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.913
As long as you understand it?

26:07.993 --> 26:11.398
I understood it, and I got to meet some interest, and he was very good in that way.

26:11.478 --> 26:16.885
I mean, you know, he was this kind of very, it was a very personally run house from them.

26:17.506 --> 26:18.928
You know, Chester was sore.

26:20.390 --> 26:33.608
But, and it was, and there were some good things and bad things about that, but he definitely, yes, you know, he really acted as if Yale University Press was up there with the U.S., the New York publishers.

26:33.925 --> 26:41.117
And if I didn't work here and didn't want to have three children and worked in my career, I might have left.

26:41.137 --> 26:43.381
But it was great for me.

26:43.542 --> 26:44.463
I always got promoted.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.048
I never have been born to this day.

26:47.729 --> 26:55.883
So if you were me and you were embarking on a centennial history of the press, what would you like to see?

26:56.234 --> 27:01.361
kind of book that really kind of celebrates the history of the press, knowing the kinds of things that I write.

27:01.381 --> 27:02.984
I mean, I'm just telling stories.

27:03.024 --> 27:04.626
I think they're stories that are interesting here.

27:04.646 --> 27:06.649
I really don't want to bore people, or at least of all myself.

27:06.669 --> 27:24.435
But I think the biggest story is, and I don't actually know how I would do this, but I think of it because, after all, you know, for such a long time, is realizing how much it has changed, but how much what a university press is, and

27:24.652 --> 27:28.097
reflects a corner of publishing.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.841
Well, is it a division of the university, I guess?

27:32.062 --> 27:45.259
Well, it's both, but it really more and more and more had to be really business-oriented, because when I first came here, I thought the level of business sophistication was nowhere, and I wasn't even MBA-trained.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.632
But things were easy.

27:48.554 --> 27:49.936
Libraries bought so many of our books.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.137
It didn't matter what you did.

27:52.059 --> 27:53.881
They had standing orders.

27:54.722 --> 27:56.845
So you didn't even have to promote them to libraries.

27:56.865 --> 27:58.387
You didn't have to price them for libraries.

27:58.407 --> 28:00.190
You didn't have to get information to them.

28:00.490 --> 28:01.932
They just out the door.

28:01.952 --> 28:03.615
They had a dedicated budget, and they were on standing order.

28:03.775 --> 28:04.296
Out the door.

28:04.456 --> 28:11.145
So immediately you had a stable income, and you had even the most monographic book.

28:11.834 --> 28:15.278
And the books we do today are equally as monographic as they were then.

28:15.298 --> 28:18.743
I mean, you know, they would just sell so much better.

28:19.203 --> 28:21.787
Define for me what you mean by a monographic book.

28:22.327 --> 28:26.092
A book that was really just an academic audience and a very narrow topic.

28:26.112 --> 28:27.974
Because they always use the word interchangeably.

28:27.995 --> 28:29.617
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

28:29.697 --> 28:34.703
But, you know, it was books that weren't for the general reader, that were very narrow.

28:35.071 --> 28:36.793
debate whether they're going to buy them or not.

28:36.953 --> 28:39.756
And there are books that we now sell three to 500 copies of.

28:39.777 --> 28:47.105
We used to sell easily 1,000 to 1,500 without even trying that hard, because the library sale was so huge.

28:47.886 --> 28:54.494
And there were some books that we did for courses, like some of the language books we did then, the DeFrancis Chinese series.

28:54.714 --> 28:57.017
You know, you just walked in, and they did well.

28:57.217 --> 29:04.065
And we published, I bet, though I've never looked at it, we published a higher percentage of Yale authors.

29:04.383 --> 29:08.247
Because this was way before they were all courted by New York places.

29:08.287 --> 29:08.387
Yeah.

29:08.407 --> 29:20.160
See, I heard that the press was always kind of slobbish about that, that they more or less, if you were at Yale, I think you really ought to prove yourself, because they wanted to demonstrate their white appeal.

29:20.180 --> 29:28.028
Well, we always made sure that we, you know, that we protected the integrity of saying, just because you were at Yale doesn't mean you get a rubber stamp.

29:29.020 --> 29:38.048
But there were a lot of people at Yale that would come here first, which isn't necessarily the truth, you know, true now, because they're courted elsewhere.

29:38.509 --> 29:55.604
But, you know, I don't actually, you know, from my early years, because I wasn't part of the decision-making process of what we published, which I have been for many years now, but I bet we got more Yale submissions, and percentage-wise they have done more.

29:55.624 --> 29:58.487
So you're part of the process in the board?

29:58.923 --> 30:02.146
The publishing committee.

30:02.326 --> 30:04.648
The board is something different.

30:04.748 --> 30:05.269
Right.

30:05.309 --> 30:06.590
That's two different things.

30:06.610 --> 30:07.951
Two very different things.

30:07.971 --> 30:09.313
And the publishing committee.

30:09.373 --> 30:12.516
The publications committee is made out of faculty.

30:13.777 --> 30:17.420
And it's actually a bigger committee now than it used to be, but that's been a constant.

30:17.460 --> 30:23.766
I mean, there are some things that were remarkably consistent at Yale University Press.

30:23.786 --> 30:25.588
But the biggest difference is

30:26.159 --> 30:33.025
among the big differences from when I first started here, the business level sophistication was nowhere.

30:33.045 --> 30:43.135
I mean, you know, you just had to pay your bills, and Chester was very fast and furious with his own personal budgets of what, you know, if you wanted to do something, you just did it.

30:43.655 --> 30:45.237
You know, we weren't as mindful.

30:47.699 --> 30:51.683
But it was easy, you know, you didn't have such tough years because things just sold.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.965
These editions sold like crazy.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.947
I mean, things, it wasn't so hard.

30:56.264 --> 30:57.485
It seemed easier.

30:57.525 --> 31:00.349
Though at the time, we would think it was hard.

31:00.769 --> 31:03.092
But in retrospect, it was easier.

31:03.512 --> 31:06.896
And there was always kind of little windfalls.

31:06.956 --> 31:22.134
I mean, the new edition that it's hard to imagine today when we're so struggling to figure out how we can continue to do these specialized editions because nobody buys them when we would look forward to the day when there was a new volume in one of these because the library sales.

31:23.356 --> 31:24.617
So you had something like

31:24.985 --> 31:28.409
The first volume of Franklin probably sold 6,500 copies.

31:28.689 --> 31:28.949
Wow.

31:28.969 --> 31:30.331
And we now sell under 1,000.

31:31.272 --> 31:31.953
It's a big difference.

31:32.273 --> 31:34.796
And yet you're still committed to seeing it.

31:34.816 --> 31:39.822
Yeah, because, I mean, that's, but instead of being something that was like kind of a foundation and an anchor.

31:39.842 --> 31:41.003
6,500 is pretty good sales.

31:41.023 --> 31:41.143
Yeah.

31:41.563 --> 31:45.848
I mean, I'll look up lots of stuff if you want to find all that stuff out, but I think that's pretty much true.

31:45.888 --> 31:46.689
That would be a good one.

31:46.709 --> 31:50.854
And that, the first volume in that series was published later.

31:51.434 --> 31:51.835
You know what?

31:52.375 --> 31:53.777
I have a printout.

31:57.773 --> 31:58.554
That should tell me.

31:59.555 --> 32:02.679
So we can, we can, there are sales figures for all these books, right?

32:02.699 --> 32:02.939
Yep.

32:03.179 --> 32:08.386
The first volume one was in 1959, and it's, I'm wrong, it sold 8,000.

32:08.766 --> 32:09.046
Wow.

32:09.347 --> 32:10.688
That's even more, isn't it?

32:10.708 --> 32:10.889
Yeah.

32:11.669 --> 32:12.551
And how about the most recent?

32:12.831 --> 32:24.765
And the most recent one was published in something along here, like this.

32:24.785 --> 32:27.308
It says 95, but I'm sure there's been some since then.

32:28.115 --> 32:28.435
women.

32:29.957 --> 32:32.060
Well, how many years did the 1995?

32:32.220 --> 32:33.803
The 1995, one sold 800.

32:34.564 --> 32:35.485
800?

32:36.566 --> 32:41.873
That was volume what in the series that you said?

32:41.893 --> 32:50.004
Oh, I know what this is, but this one is still over.

32:50.024 --> 32:50.605
That was, that was volume 31.

32:50.625 --> 32:52.267
Let me see if there's something more recently.

32:52.508 --> 32:53.208
Okay, volume 37.

32:56.112 --> 32:56.433
I'm missing you.

32:56.453 --> 32:56.653
Volume 37.

32:57.494 --> 33:04.269
Thirty-seven.

33:04.489 --> 33:05.331
Volume thirty-seven.

33:07.135 --> 33:08.338
Thirty-seven.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.202
Published 2004.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.269
2004.

33:13.289 --> 33:13.649
650.

33:13.670 --> 33:14.030
650.

33:14.050 --> 33:14.411
[Knocking.] Hi.

33:14.431 --> 33:14.792
Hi.

33:16.293 --> 33:18.697
I'm so engrossed.

33:18.717 --> 33:19.398
Oh, it's fun.

33:19.618 --> 33:21.881
It's making me feel very old.

33:22.622 --> 33:23.824
You're taking Nick off.

33:24.124 --> 33:25.687
I am, if that's okay.

33:26.508 --> 33:27.089
What time?

33:27.309 --> 33:29.793
A couple minutes, is that?

33:29.813 --> 33:30.694
Oh, God, it's already 12.

33:30.754 --> 33:33.478
You and I are going to be best friends before this video.

33:33.498 --> 33:34.700
That's what I'm thinking.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.402
This probably didn't do it, huh?

33:36.422 --> 33:36.623
Yeah.

33:36.763 --> 33:39.627
No, but it's... Give us till about 12, okay?

33:39.787 --> 33:40.288
Okay.

33:40.408 --> 33:41.430
I'll beat you down in the lobby.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.451
I'll be there.

33:42.471 --> 33:42.752
Very good.

33:42.792 --> 33:42.992
Excellent.

33:44.778 --> 33:55.571
I know, but you know, actually, in some ways, I mean, it's good to talk to me early, but then come back to me after you've done lots of stuff.

33:55.591 --> 33:55.691
Yeah.

33:55.711 --> 33:57.313
This is my sixth at the beginning.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.775
What have you done so far?

33:58.855 --> 34:00.117
Well, I've just been pretty good.

34:00.137 --> 34:01.678
I've had John Byron.

34:02.239 --> 34:04.201
I've had Morgan Gattis-Smith.

34:04.682 --> 34:05.543
John Hollander.

34:06.344 --> 34:06.644
Uh-huh.

34:06.664 --> 34:09.067
And I once did Jonathan.

34:09.087 --> 34:11.270
Brent, yeah.

34:11.490 --> 34:12.912
I've missed somebody.

34:13.465 --> 34:15.990
Are you going to do Dana Pratt, who's in Washington?

34:16.010 --> 34:18.596
Actually, I'm going to go to the UK, because it's a nice reason.

34:18.616 --> 34:19.798
But you do John Nichol?

34:19.939 --> 34:20.400
Yeah.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.023
Oh, he's great.

34:22.043 --> 34:23.987
Well, this is not just an outpost to see.

34:24.087 --> 34:27.795
I mean, I've been persuaded that this is a very important

34:28.163 --> 34:29.385
element of the press.

34:29.865 --> 34:32.829
Oh, the villain and us, yes, and Stephanie Sutton.

34:32.889 --> 34:35.192
I mean, there's tons of people.

34:35.212 --> 34:37.315
Maybe we can get together again in a couple weeks.

34:37.575 --> 34:37.996
Whenever.

34:38.016 --> 34:39.378
I mean, I'm happy.

34:39.398 --> 34:41.781
Sooner rather than later, because... At your convenience.

34:41.821 --> 34:42.382
I'm always here.

34:42.562 --> 34:43.643
And I'd love to hear.

34:43.663 --> 34:46.347
I mean, I'd love to talk to you and say, okay, this is what I've heard.

34:46.387 --> 34:47.568
No, what do you think?

34:47.588 --> 34:50.532
And I'd love to hear some of the stuff that you really suggest that I have.

34:51.794 --> 34:55.639
Some things that you really think would be worth my...

34:56.328 --> 35:07.938
Yeah, well, there are some people who... I mean, I think I have this huge regard for this press.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.840
But there's always been things that's happened.

35:09.860 --> 35:16.325
Well, I mean, you want to give a nice little narrative of what's going on here.

35:17.426 --> 35:18.687
But it's interesting.

35:18.707 --> 35:23.251
I mean, it's such a reflection of what's happened in trade publishing to a degree.

35:23.351 --> 35:25.693
I mean, the kinds of books that we're able to do.

35:26.298 --> 35:26.679
Yeah, exactly.

35:26.699 --> 35:29.743
Reflects what other people are or are not doing.

35:29.763 --> 35:33.630
And in some cases, more what they're not doing, more than what they are doing.

35:34.351 --> 35:39.960
And the fact that our art list right now is that we have such clout.

35:40.380 --> 35:45.288
It has a lot to do with how good we are, but it also has a lot to do with others and publishers backing off.

35:45.829 --> 35:51.979
Oh, I just, I get, I still review books and I get all the catalogs.

35:51.999 --> 35:54.162
And I just went through the new Abrams catalog.

35:54.547 --> 35:56.310
It's totally different.

35:57.112 --> 36:04.846
It used to be, I used to pant, and Paul was a friend of mine, and I always wanted to work for him, and I would have loved to in a way.

36:04.926 --> 36:07.551
And it's, because I always was jealous.

36:07.651 --> 36:11.458
I was always jealous of their list, and now he would be jealous of ours.

36:12.350 --> 36:16.761
You can't really call it an art... No, it's so down market now.

36:16.781 --> 36:21.333
But that's been, I mean, the whole art story is... Can't even get a review copy out of them anymore.

36:21.594 --> 36:21.794
Really?

36:21.814 --> 36:23.038
Well, I mean, you get one or two or three.

36:23.158 --> 36:25.444
That I'm amazed.

36:25.464 --> 36:27.068
And I review for ten papers.

36:27.706 --> 36:30.973
You know, I mean, the Orlando Sentinel was just pretty good paper.

36:31.474 --> 36:33.418
But you've always done the old books.

36:33.438 --> 36:34.300
Well, I mean, I do them.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.545
I do nine, ten of them a year, you know.

36:36.565 --> 36:37.688
What have you done recently?

36:37.788 --> 36:39.111
Well, I do it every year.

36:39.351 --> 36:40.474
I do it once a year now.

36:40.494 --> 36:48.010
I mean, I'm not doing them weekly or monthly anymore, but I still kind of keep my beak in the wire a little bit.

36:48.395 --> 36:52.781
But I do all of your art books at least once a year.

36:52.801 --> 36:56.446
And that particular piece I'm able to market to about a dozen newspapers.

36:56.766 --> 36:57.066
Sure.

36:57.447 --> 37:03.335
In Wichita, you know, places that don't really do this, but Pittsburgh and Worcester.

37:03.495 --> 37:05.818
Yeah, I'm happy to see reviews of our books there.

37:06.739 --> 37:07.961
Yeah, and all of the places.

37:08.001 --> 37:15.651
But, I mean, even with a million papers, let's say, or more, taking my stories, you'd think I'd get anything I wanted from Abrams, you know.

37:15.968 --> 37:18.611
I really have to make a case.

37:18.871 --> 37:21.814
I'm getting tired of having to do this, you know, because the book's not worth it.

37:22.135 --> 37:24.017
Well, they're very down market now.

37:24.337 --> 37:24.457
Yeah.

37:24.477 --> 37:25.618
Carol Morgan's a nice woman.

37:25.658 --> 37:30.283
I like working with her, but I have to call her and say, Carol, I'm going to have a bit of books here.

37:30.303 --> 37:33.206
Why is it so hard to, you know, they have a price thing.

37:33.226 --> 37:35.409
It's really petty.

37:35.429 --> 37:38.192
I wonder if that's coming from their French ownership and stuff.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.214
Oh, I think so, yeah, yeah.

37:40.234 --> 37:42.877
Limit your selections to six books or something like that.

37:43.257 --> 37:44.018
Are they crazy?

37:44.251 --> 37:45.933
Why are they so short-sighted?

37:46.273 --> 37:47.014
Really, it's stupid.

37:47.975 --> 37:51.799
Especially where I'm not trying to con them out of a book, you know.

37:51.859 --> 37:53.601
I'm trying to do something with it, you know.

37:54.342 --> 37:58.266
Anyway, Yale has been more innovative.

37:58.346 --> 37:59.447
More innovative than others.

37:59.467 --> 38:00.328
That's a good word.

38:00.348 --> 38:10.599
You know, going out on a limb, trying new things, doing things that somebody else might have backed off.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.903
Even our little electronic project at the time was very...

38:14.086 --> 38:14.627
big deal.

38:14.647 --> 38:18.992
The art list, expansion of the art list, we've done that in a very creative way.

38:19.052 --> 38:23.537
Maybe we could follow up on that electronic thing.

38:23.557 --> 38:25.680
Oh, I should get you some more information on that.

38:26.361 --> 38:27.983
Maybe we can email or something like that.

38:28.003 --> 38:29.284
And now we're doing stuff.

38:29.945 --> 38:31.467
Actually, I wouldn't say we're in the forefront.

38:31.487 --> 38:34.331
I think that was one of the most innovative things we did at the time.

38:34.671 --> 38:38.616
Other people have done stuff, and now we're just sort of learning what to do.

38:39.116 --> 38:41.359
Very big sea changes going on now.

38:41.643 --> 38:43.325
Oh, yeah.

38:43.425 --> 38:45.647
Well, Columbia is doing a lot of that.

38:45.667 --> 38:46.328
Yeah, not so well.

38:46.348 --> 38:48.450
Nobody's figured out how to do it really well.

38:48.770 --> 38:52.894
But I think Yale has, you know how kind of you see publishing houses go up and down?

38:52.914 --> 38:54.956
I think Yale has been amazing to me.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.978
I like to think I have something to do with it.

38:57.559 --> 39:03.385
It just keeps going, you know, and expanding in what it does, what it publishes, the number of books it does.

39:03.745 --> 39:07.909
So I wouldn't like to see that go anymore, because it's hard to do it well.

39:08.290 --> 39:09.591
Next time you can buy me lunch.

39:09.638 --> 39:10.329
I would love to.

39:10.370 --> 39:12.342
Just call me any time.
