WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:05.951
Test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:06.431 --> 00:08.213
You kind of alluded to a couple of things.

00:08.313 --> 00:23.306
You said that you've always been very capable of doing something and taking it to the next level, and I guess that applies to your business, and I suppose it applies as well to the library.

00:24.607 --> 00:29.090
I guess you could almost call you genius, which is to... Let's not go overboard.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.932
Let's not go overboard.

00:31.334 --> 00:43.531
But you mentioned, I guess, is it fair to say that this library acquired, you mentioned your wife's death and your son's death.

00:44.513 --> 00:55.829
And I understand that I want to deal with this with the greatest of sensitivity, but I think I can't ignore it either.

00:55.849 --> 01:00.295
And I wonder if this project, upon a certain direction and purpose,

01:00.747 --> 01:10.117
I think it was already started when my wife had been underway for, say, 15, 18 years.

01:11.218 --> 01:23.891
I think what it did, it became more purposeful and perhaps larger in scope and then more focused.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.974
Justin was...

01:27.410 --> 01:35.298
a friend and a supplier and advisor even before that time.

01:36.098 --> 01:44.407
I think after that I did have a sense of wanting to do something that was more lasting, perhaps.

01:45.548 --> 01:57.079
So that made me perhaps a more serious both collector and mission-oriented purpose.

01:58.122 --> 02:03.608
And again, let me say while the paper's running, I want to do this right.

02:03.908 --> 02:06.751
I want you to be pleased with what I do here.

02:07.432 --> 02:12.477
And so I'm certainly willing to go over with you the quotes that I intend to use, if you'd like that.

02:13.498 --> 02:16.441
So no surprises with what I do.

02:18.683 --> 02:22.968
And this book is a book of purpose, so I've lost my train here.

02:23.428 --> 02:26.391
But to reiterate,

02:27.097 --> 02:34.126
the sense of purpose did more or less nucleate at that point.

02:34.146 --> 02:42.837
I think probably we were collecting for ourselves and our children or rationalized for our children but for ourselves as well.

02:43.638 --> 02:54.471
And I think the idea of having a library or an educational library and a library for children hadn't

02:56.594 --> 03:00.759
We hadn't come to that bridge or that next step.

03:00.999 --> 03:09.989
And I didn't come to that until when I was in 79, and I don't think I started thinking about that until the late 80s.

03:10.009 --> 03:14.954
Do you see this, in a way, as a tribute, as a memorial?

03:15.294 --> 03:20.961
Oh, I think the library, my interest in children's books would not have been there without my wife.

03:22.302 --> 03:25.926
And I think I've had other things...

03:26.395 --> 03:48.100
I think I'm indebted to my mother, who gave me

03:49.868 --> 03:53.392
Oh, what the world was through reading, encouraged that.

03:53.592 --> 03:55.194
Can you talk a little bit about that?

03:55.635 --> 03:57.197
You just mentioned that you're from Boston.

03:57.257 --> 03:58.919
You didn't mention your family at all.

04:00.140 --> 04:10.953
Well, I have a brother, a mother-father passed on, but I think my mother was the one who urged us and exposed us to things outside the house.

04:11.254 --> 04:12.575
And what was your name?

04:12.595 --> 04:13.396
Sophie Coates.

04:13.937 --> 04:16.640
My father was... S-O-P-H-I-E.

04:17.281 --> 04:19.183
She was born in Boston, Dorchester.

04:19.923 --> 04:30.415
My father was born in Montreal, and his parents all came from Lithuania.

04:33.338 --> 04:39.084
But she was—I think both our parents gave us a sense.

04:39.865 --> 04:43.129
We knew we were going to get educated, come hell of high water.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.269
What did your brother do?

04:45.549 --> 04:53.999
He was a salesman, rose to be sales manager, worked for more or less one company all his life outside Newark in New England.

04:54.039 --> 04:58.224
In fact, I remember, we used to go on sales trips on the weekend.

04:58.244 --> 04:59.886
He'd leave us in the hotel in Worcester.

05:00.587 --> 05:00.827
Really?

05:01.568 --> 05:02.069
In the lobby.

05:02.149 --> 05:03.430
The old Bancroft probably?

05:03.590 --> 05:06.754
One that had a machine like kicking football somewhere.

05:06.774 --> 05:07.615
I can't remember what it was.

05:08.405 --> 05:10.028
He'd make a sales call.

05:10.649 --> 05:12.152
I had to come in to Durgan Park.

05:12.632 --> 05:13.314
Oh, that was great.

05:13.574 --> 05:18.262
And I always remembered there was a gal, a lady there, and I felt so grown up at eight years old.

05:19.545 --> 05:29.202
And I always wondered why there was the bottle called Four Roses and there was no flowers in it.

05:29.222 --> 05:29.923
Kids, aren't they?

05:30.292 --> 05:32.575
I grew up in Lowell, actually, myself.

05:32.695 --> 05:34.498
You mentioned you were in the Navy, by the way.

05:34.558 --> 05:35.379
I was in the Navy.

05:35.439 --> 05:36.821
What kind of ship were you in?

05:36.901 --> 05:41.948
I was amphibious landing craft and a beach group commander type thing.

05:41.968 --> 05:42.148
Really?

05:42.589 --> 05:43.430
I was in a carrier.

05:43.650 --> 05:49.058
I've been a public affairs officer in the Ibrisconi, as a matter of fact.

05:49.358 --> 05:50.600
I remember passing.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.182
They were in our task force.

05:52.342 --> 05:53.304
Yeah, it was a great ship.

05:54.585 --> 05:55.707
What years were you in?

05:55.727 --> 05:57.329
I was in 50 to 53.

05:57.830 --> 05:57.970
Uh-huh.

05:58.220 --> 05:58.801
Korea then?

05:58.821 --> 05:59.542
Yeah.

05:59.562 --> 06:00.344
So you're over there.

06:00.364 --> 06:00.504
Yeah.

06:01.165 --> 06:02.768
You're an old Westpac sailor.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.273
I used to sail out of Alameda.

06:07.155 --> 06:09.599
I was really taken by it, and this was new to me, you know.

06:10.180 --> 06:19.215
I thought this sense of archaeology really does fascinate me, you know, and it has to have instilled

06:19.685 --> 06:21.327
And you mentioned going through the tapes.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.551
Now, you missed things, which is why I tape it.

06:23.571 --> 06:28.138
You said that you had participated in 25 or 30 gigs in Greece.

06:28.318 --> 06:29.340
Is that right?

06:29.380 --> 06:31.963
Can you tell me a little bit about that, the kinds of things that you did?

06:31.984 --> 06:41.438
Well, I was, when I got out of Navy, I went back to graduate school, and I was a provisional architectural graduate student.

06:42.019 --> 06:43.281
What's the intention of doing what?

06:43.581 --> 06:44.262
To be an architect?

06:44.282 --> 06:46.946
Be an architect, like Frank Lloyd Wright.

06:48.188 --> 06:48.949
But I was better

06:50.819 --> 06:56.687
And I wasn't very disciplined, so I never redid anything.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.549
So I got bored.

06:58.569 --> 07:00.311
But I wasn't that good either.

07:00.912 --> 07:03.616
So Princeton suggested I go elsewhere.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.940
And I did.

07:07.260 --> 07:17.113
So just before leaving, a job opportunity came up from a classmate of being an architect on excavation in Greece.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.059
And I was going to Harvard after that.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.081
To business school?

07:23.101 --> 07:24.002
Well, I had a choice.

07:24.042 --> 07:27.106
I didn't know whether I was going to law school, architecture school, or business school.

07:27.126 --> 07:29.569
I got accepted to all three.

07:29.589 --> 07:36.618
And I decided business school was the shortest number of years.

07:37.799 --> 07:44.688
But I went down to Greece, I bought a book on surveying, and they thought I was an architect, and I really wasn't.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.750
And the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing.

07:47.451 --> 07:48.012
And...

07:48.548 --> 07:50.851
As I say, I went to Athens, and I missed Athens.

07:50.991 --> 07:52.453
Ended up, really, with my wife.

07:52.533 --> 07:53.655
First time I ever been to New York.

07:54.997 --> 08:03.708
And I worked as a field architect in a little village down in the Peloponnese below August.

08:04.630 --> 08:06.312
And for the next five years, I was there.

08:06.532 --> 08:07.754
Really?

08:07.774 --> 08:14.483
And not five summers, but I spent two years during that time.

08:14.503 --> 08:16.185
Still in your 20s at this point?

08:17.006 --> 08:18.108
Oh, boy.

08:18.128 --> 08:18.268
I was

08:18.637 --> 08:19.999
That was 55, 56.

08:20.019 --> 08:21.422
Yeah, because it's after the service.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.403
Yeah.

08:22.424 --> 08:31.299
So it was 20, 27, yeah, 26, 27, 28 years.

08:31.359 --> 08:31.940
Great time.

08:32.441 --> 08:32.781
Good time.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.907
You know, I had a scholarship, fellowship.

08:37.249 --> 08:41.316
And what were these ancient things that you were digging?

08:41.336 --> 08:42.518
These were things from...

08:43.342 --> 08:46.585
the Mycenaean times, Agamemnon, and before.

08:46.945 --> 08:52.750
So we were digging from early man to the Trojan War period.

08:53.091 --> 08:53.331
Wow.

08:53.891 --> 08:56.954
And I was interested in architecture and early houses.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.055
And the earlier, the better.

08:58.295 --> 09:06.082
I had a childhood interest of where man came from, how, et cetera.

09:06.102 --> 09:08.724
And I used to do a lot of reading as a kid in the library.

09:10.746 --> 09:12.808
So I read all the books and archaeologists again.

09:13.885 --> 09:33.032
And anyway, I went to work, and one of the ways to be successful in that business, although I didn't know it at the time, was to do a right unintelligibly, so they'd have to invite you back the next year to decipher your stuff.

09:33.052 --> 09:42.846
Anyway, I did well enough that I got a fellowship and invited back, so I took time off from business school and went back and forth, and

09:43.248 --> 09:49.697
Then after business school, fortunately, I had not that much responsibility in charge.

09:49.717 --> 09:56.446
My son said, how come when I had no money I could take two months off and now I have all the money and I can take seven days off?

09:56.706 --> 09:58.349
I said, something's wrong.

09:58.549 --> 10:00.832
I said, you're right.

10:00.852 --> 10:11.787
But did you ever, when you handled these things, I guess I'm making a leap here, but when you handled these, I mean, I know I think of something really old or

10:12.037 --> 10:16.102
an old piece of marble even that's part of a temple or something like that.

10:16.122 --> 10:18.805
You really, I mean, these cuneiform tablets that you have.

10:19.506 --> 10:20.727
You must feel something.

10:20.888 --> 10:31.520
Oh, I think, yeah, it's the, you may be mute, and the stones may be mute, but you really have a feeling of, you know, I can listen to the voices.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.364
I'm making them, being overly romantic.

10:34.444 --> 10:35.906
Yeah, that's good.

10:35.926 --> 10:39.690
When I pick up a pot, and I do it to my child, I say, feel this.

10:39.810 --> 10:41.352
You know, some person made this.

10:42.209 --> 11:11.862
and their mate was screaming come in for dinner or do this and the kids are stepping in the charcoal you know and to think you know that here we are with lights it would look miraculous to these people 5,000 years ago and to think that you know I'm doing this having this thing here and 5,000 years is gone and what they were thinking and how the you know their lives were but this must have some kind of a

11:12.044 --> 11:20.273
an impact on, to get back to the coaching children's library, it must have something, some impact.

11:20.293 --> 11:26.700
I think there's a quest, you know, a treasure hunt, or, I think it's a personal treasure hunt.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.045
It happens to be an intellectual treasure hunt rather than one for gold.

11:31.826 --> 11:35.931
Gold was never a thing that I purposely sought.

11:37.352 --> 11:38.173
It sort of happened.

11:38.814 --> 11:39.134
Really?

11:39.415 --> 11:39.655
Yeah.

11:40.073 --> 11:45.039
I always think I walked in shit, you know, but it happened to be gold, but it just happened.

11:46.560 --> 11:51.225
Basically, you can tell me a little bit about your experiences with the business?

11:51.846 --> 12:08.064
Yeah, the business, I couldn't get a job out of business school, and my father-in-law had a either married time and had to either put me to work or support me in the style, which I was accustomed to.

12:08.084 --> 12:08.865
I wanted to be accustomed to.

12:09.453 --> 12:13.259
And he had a small business, and he wanted me to, would I be interested?

12:13.380 --> 12:14.782
And what was the name of the business?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.525
It was at that time called Natone.

12:17.426 --> 12:18.488
N-A-T-O-N-E.

12:19.650 --> 12:20.031
One word?

12:20.392 --> 12:20.792
One word.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.418
He was a sort of super salesperson.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.223
It was his business?

12:27.904 --> 12:28.044
Yeah.

12:28.305 --> 12:29.747
Did they manufacture things?

12:29.787 --> 12:30.849
They made lip brushes.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.151
Lip brushes.

12:32.592 --> 12:33.814
They put lipstick on.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.477
Women's cosmetic accessories.

12:36.284 --> 12:41.552
And when I came in, he was importing a product from Europe.

12:43.475 --> 12:43.875
Brushes?

12:44.336 --> 12:44.577
No.

12:45.698 --> 12:45.959
Other things?

12:46.019 --> 12:46.479
Other things.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.322
If you don't mind talking about the business.

12:48.663 --> 12:51.567
It was a business probably doing about $500,000.

12:51.707 --> 12:54.512
And this is in the 50s?

12:54.532 --> 12:54.972
50s.

12:56.054 --> 12:58.498
And it was a private business.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.180
Based out here?

13:00.441 --> 13:01.142
Based out here.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.405
And...

13:04.381 --> 13:11.067
He didn't have anybody to leave it to, and he wanted—he enjoyed it, and he was very good at it.

13:12.469 --> 13:19.476
And when I was in the Navy out here, he had come down to visit me on the ship before we were married.

13:19.696 --> 13:21.758
What was your name, your ship?

13:21.778 --> 13:23.139
It was the Bayfield.

13:23.900 --> 13:24.280
Onewood?

13:24.961 --> 13:26.122
APA 33, yeah.

13:27.884 --> 13:30.726
And we were, I think, a hundred feet off.

13:30.746 --> 13:33.409
The officers covered in the channel.

13:34.351 --> 13:34.852
San Diego.

13:35.452 --> 13:41.119
And he came down, had been taken down in Maine for three days, didn't get sick, and decided, well, maybe he could go to Europe.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.362
So he went to Europe after that.

13:44.042 --> 13:48.227
And later, he had found this product.

13:48.247 --> 13:50.530
And when I came in... This product being what?

13:50.610 --> 13:52.332
Neutrogena.

13:52.352 --> 13:54.034
And what was it at that point?

13:54.074 --> 13:56.217
It was a soap bar.

13:56.257 --> 13:58.039
The same soap that we characterized today, right?

13:58.059 --> 13:59.921
It was made in Belgium.

14:00.482 --> 14:01.323
He imported it.

14:02.324 --> 14:03.025
And...

14:04.152 --> 14:05.534
Is that what it was called, indulging?

14:06.055 --> 14:07.537
Yeah.

14:07.617 --> 14:10.901
And it means neutralizing in Flemish or in French.

14:10.921 --> 14:11.963
And that was a bland name?

14:12.343 --> 14:13.305
There was one bar.

14:13.445 --> 14:13.886
It wasn't.

14:14.386 --> 14:21.757
And this fellow made it, and he had the vision.

14:21.797 --> 14:27.505
My father-in-law had the vision, one, to give it a high price, and two, to see that the difference was in the transparency.

14:28.266 --> 14:32.151
And if I had been there, I probably would have said, don't take it, but I didn't.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.562
I wasn't there around at the time.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.386
I was working in Greece.

14:37.406 --> 14:47.419
And fortunately, that was the brand that I got involved in, the product.

14:47.439 --> 14:49.662
When you were finally through digging for artifacts.

14:49.782 --> 14:51.865
And he gave me the responsibility for that one.

14:51.885 --> 14:54.308
It was about $80,000 a year.

14:55.110 --> 14:57.813
This is about, like, $60,000 or so, would you say?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.235
No, this was in the...

14:59.570 --> 15:00.291
Late 50s.

15:00.933 --> 15:01.113
Late 50s.

15:01.133 --> 15:08.807
And I went over and learned how to make it and set up a little place, smaller than this apartment, and made it downtown near the Good Samaritan.

15:10.490 --> 15:11.512
And a couple of funny stories.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.560
One, I made the bar.

15:16.842 --> 15:19.948
I'm making my first batch, and I had one of the things wrong.

15:20.910 --> 15:22.793
I mean, they had the speed of the mixer.

15:23.650 --> 15:24.050
wrong.

15:24.311 --> 15:28.376
And out came whipped potatoes instead of mixed.

15:28.396 --> 15:35.404
So I had to go in the tank and take a shovel and scoop out the whips, because the whipped potatoes, they wouldn't flow through.

15:36.225 --> 15:41.231
And all the office help wanted to know what the mad son-in-law was doing.

15:41.251 --> 15:42.272
And I had no clothes on.

15:42.452 --> 15:47.979
And I'm in the tank, and I'm laughing because I remember the old cartoons of having the barrel, no clothes.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.702
And fortunately, I am above them.

15:51.423 --> 15:53.185
They don't know why I'm laughing.

15:53.603 --> 16:05.614
As I'm scooping out the stuff, the blades I had designed for the tank are rectangular paddles, but stainless steel and square edges, corners.

16:05.654 --> 16:06.997
This was your machine.

16:07.057 --> 16:08.501
Yeah, I made the machine.

16:08.521 --> 16:10.466
You made it.

16:10.787 --> 16:10.887
Yeah.

16:12.149 --> 16:18.976
Every time I bent down with the shovel, I really, you know, poked my ass on these blades.

16:20.437 --> 16:28.264
So even today in our plant, with all the stuff in the huge, big tanks as big as this whole part of the room, all the blades have rounded corners.

16:28.865 --> 16:31.848
Nobody knows why now, except when you hear this story.

16:31.868 --> 16:35.091
I'm sure you've got scars on your butt, though, right?

16:35.111 --> 16:37.593
And so that was a modification I made.

16:37.814 --> 16:39.215
What did you call that machine?

16:39.235 --> 16:41.397
Just a mixer?

16:42.828 --> 16:52.401
Anyway, I was able again to focus and stay in that one brand and build a brand.

16:55.986 --> 16:56.647
Yeah, right.

16:56.828 --> 16:58.330
Yeah, tell them to come on up.

16:58.350 --> 17:02.495
I'll come on up, please.

17:02.516 --> 17:07.182
And so, and...

17:07.651 --> 17:10.915
He was good enough to let me do what I wanted.

17:11.135 --> 17:12.817
Was it a division in the company?

17:12.837 --> 17:15.780
Well, it was a product.

17:15.860 --> 17:22.767
So the challenge here was to take this soap invented by a Belgian man and to see if it had an upscale market.

17:22.807 --> 17:26.031
No, I think what I saw in it, I didn't want to sell soap.

17:26.912 --> 17:33.098
I wanted to sell something else, health, well-being, and I wanted a brand name.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.481
I didn't want a product.

17:36.355 --> 17:40.120
So what my goal was to take that one brick and make it into a wall.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.463
Again, the metaphor you used yesterday.

17:42.483 --> 17:42.964
Yeah, right.

17:44.085 --> 17:45.006
And so that's what I did.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.129
One product, then I made another product.

17:47.589 --> 17:50.754
Same name, same name.

17:50.774 --> 17:54.238
Oddly enough, I'm now in business.

17:54.258 --> 17:56.982
I share a business with Bill Gates.

17:57.983 --> 18:05.873
And somebody sent me a copy of his biography in which he says, all I am in marketing now is Lloyd Coatsen.

18:06.258 --> 18:08.001
He says this in the book?

18:08.081 --> 18:10.665
Is this the book, the one about the... I don't know which book.

18:10.745 --> 18:11.607
I can't remember.

18:11.627 --> 18:12.047
It's a new one.

18:12.067 --> 18:12.648
It just came out.

18:12.668 --> 18:13.610
No, it's an older one.

18:13.970 --> 18:14.091
Is it?

18:14.311 --> 18:14.812
I think.

18:14.832 --> 18:18.598
Anyway, it was... What he meant was that I had one name.

18:18.758 --> 18:20.701
I made everything Nutritina.

18:20.721 --> 18:21.903
That was a family name.

18:22.424 --> 18:23.646
And they did everything.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.891
My marketing guy went to his company and set it up.

18:27.913 --> 18:30.737
And they made everything Microsoft.

18:30.757 --> 18:31.919
Everything Microsoft.

18:31.939 --> 18:33.582
So that's really the...

18:34.726 --> 18:40.613
I hesitate to use the word genius, but that was the key of all the different products.

18:40.633 --> 18:42.094
How many different products would you say?

18:42.635 --> 18:45.458
Oh, I think we had 30, 40 products.

18:45.518 --> 18:47.741
But they were all in the arena.

18:47.821 --> 18:53.807
And the other stuff I spun off and killed, including the products named after my mother-in-law and all that stuff.

18:53.827 --> 18:56.090
She was very good about it.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.151
I told her, sorry.

18:58.393 --> 19:02.337
So I really believed in focusing and doing one thing well.

19:03.515 --> 19:04.717
everything to everybody.

19:04.737 --> 19:06.220
So anyway, that's business.

19:06.501 --> 19:08.765
How did you get to meet, get together with Gates?

19:09.727 --> 19:12.192
Oh, I was in a startup biotech.

19:13.494 --> 19:20.929
And one of the guys who was a very, who he sponsored coming from Caltech up there, was on our advisory board.

19:21.670 --> 19:26.299
And Bill came in as a backer after we were in

19:26.920 --> 19:29.844
hoping he'll talk to me at some point for the Corbis thing.

19:29.864 --> 19:30.344
I doubt it.

19:30.645 --> 19:31.265
I doubt it, too.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.468
But that's why I haven't even asked.

19:33.849 --> 19:39.696
I'm going up next week for a couple of days to get somebody coming up here.

19:39.716 --> 19:42.700
I've got somebody else.

19:42.720 --> 19:52.472
Really, I didn't have, I really did want to, you know, as a matter of, I know it's a delicate matter, but I, you know, my, I have to

19:53.752 --> 19:54.973
I wanted to ask away.

19:55.394 --> 20:14.892
I guess really what I really wanted to ask, I asked, is this sense of the library as a... I think I'm always... I think one, both archaeology and my own life of being sort of discriminated against always made me more sensitive.

20:14.912 --> 20:20.077
I always felt to be a good marketer, you had to be a loser someplace along the line.

20:20.097 --> 20:21.919
You had to understand what it is to lose something.

20:22.692 --> 20:27.678
If you never lost anything, you're oblivious.

20:28.759 --> 20:33.745
So tell me, how long have you been, we're talking to Ivy, right?

20:34.205 --> 20:37.069
And you're Ivy Trent, right?

20:37.309 --> 20:38.010
T-R-E-N-T.

20:38.811 --> 20:41.494
And you've been Bolton's librarian?

20:41.854 --> 20:42.595
Six years.

20:42.655 --> 20:43.136
Six years.

20:44.137 --> 20:50.404
And at that point, when you came in, was it mainly to organize the library, uh...

20:50.992 --> 21:20.526
At the time I came, there were about 5,000 titles online, and we had a tremendous backlog of incoming, but hadn't been a lot of problems with duplication and purchasing duplicates.

21:22.227 --> 21:26.873
After three years, we had pretty much caught up and had 20,000 entries.

21:26.893 --> 21:28.715
I didn't do all of those.

21:29.176 --> 21:37.787
We had some people come in to do non-Roman alphabets, so the Hebrew books were done by someone else.

21:37.807 --> 21:39.148
What was your background?

21:39.208 --> 21:41.351
Did you say you were... I came from the book trade.

21:41.411 --> 21:44.315
I worked at Zaitlin for Brugge Booksellers.

21:44.335 --> 21:45.376
Oh, you did?

21:46.097 --> 21:46.918
Zaitlin, yes.

21:47.742 --> 21:52.250
You came here about, that would have been 1990, I guess, when you came here, right?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.113
Yes.

21:54.193 --> 21:59.502
Was there a sense then that all these books were going someplace?

21:59.903 --> 22:01.024
Yes, yes.

22:01.044 --> 22:02.467
So this was the plan.

22:04.110 --> 22:04.390
Yes.

22:04.490 --> 22:10.120
You had been thinking about this, apparently, even though the bequest was two years or so, I guess, right?

22:10.360 --> 22:10.881
Yes.

22:12.008 --> 22:17.853
So had it formulated at that point that it was Princeton, or was he more or less still developing it as a concept?

22:18.514 --> 22:24.780
He was still considering his options and talking to different people.

22:24.880 --> 22:29.144
It was, at that time, about two blocks from their back gate.

22:29.364 --> 22:30.485
I can see why.

22:30.685 --> 22:34.328
It would have, in some ways, been very desirable for it to go to UC.

22:34.348 --> 22:41.695
Experians don't have the freedom to promise things that private institutions have.

22:42.670 --> 22:47.516
And, of course, he's an alumnus of Craig Youth in that direction.

22:48.397 --> 22:51.841
I'm sure I'll think of other things I want to ask you.

22:51.961 --> 22:52.882
I thought we had a brief.

22:53.002 --> 23:10.222
The thing is, so many collections I've seen, like Betsy Shirley's or I Name Hers, or even Chef Louie's that he's been adding to it, they'd like to think that when it's there, they're done.

23:10.563 --> 23:10.703
Mm-hmm.

23:11.071 --> 23:12.073
It never really happens.

23:12.113 --> 23:15.401
Like Chef Louis says, it's like having a... It's not supposed to happen.

23:15.421 --> 23:17.306
It's like having a baby after the menopause.

23:17.326 --> 23:18.749
I met him when he had the bakery.

23:18.889 --> 23:19.310
Yeah.

23:19.330 --> 23:19.611
Did you?

23:19.631 --> 23:28.291
A friend of mine, my R&D guy, was very interested in cooking and art and everything.

23:28.311 --> 23:28.692
He's a...

23:29.060 --> 23:30.061
He's a sweet guy.

23:30.081 --> 23:31.423
In fact, I'm going to see him in Chicago.

23:31.443 --> 23:32.744
I must say, book people are very nice.

23:33.004 --> 23:33.645
Aren't they, though?

23:33.765 --> 23:34.566
And they're interesting.

23:35.387 --> 23:36.688
It's amazing.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.531
You've never been stiffed by a book.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.515
I mean, I don't know if that's... I mean, you know, I say, well, you don't know my check.

23:43.616 --> 23:44.557
You can send it to me.

23:44.637 --> 23:45.357
It's amazing, isn't it?

23:45.377 --> 23:46.699
It's amazing.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.461
I've noticed the same thing myself.

23:48.801 --> 23:51.904
And I look and I'm interested in other people's collections.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.488
I think, you know, Betsy has a great collection.

23:56.529 --> 23:58.071
Justin's very knowledgeable.

23:58.878 --> 24:00.981
The Lilly collection's great.

24:01.402 --> 24:07.893
You know, there's a lot of good children's, well, let's say a half dozen really good children's book collections.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.094
One in Europe.

24:09.114 --> 24:09.675
I don't know.

24:09.695 --> 24:23.738
There's an interesting story that happens to be European of the International Jugend Bibliothek in Munich,

24:24.157 --> 24:25.479
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

24:25.619 --> 24:28.062
I'm not, but I'm having some European stuff.

24:28.082 --> 24:32.188
Okay, it's in Munich, and it has about 500,000 volumes.

24:33.690 --> 24:39.097
It's in a castle, and it was funded by the... How many volumes?

24:39.117 --> 24:40.078
500,000-something.

24:41.760 --> 24:49.611
It's funded, and the sheep are outside in this little cafeteria, and the public's not really welcome.

24:51.093 --> 24:51.413
But...

24:52.085 --> 24:53.326
It's a private library?

24:53.567 --> 24:55.269
No, it's state and public.

24:56.049 --> 25:01.015
And they have a budget of $12,000 a year, I think, for acquisitions.

25:01.856 --> 25:02.997
But it's pedagogical.

25:04.999 --> 25:06.461
Which you have steadfastly avoided.

25:06.481 --> 25:07.182
Which I stayed away from.

25:07.943 --> 25:14.430
But I went there one time, and it was started, the story that I'm getting too long-winded,

25:14.815 --> 25:22.707
There was a lady from Germany, her husband was from Germany, and Hitler came and they fled Germany and went to New York.

25:24.169 --> 25:35.687
Her husband died during the war in New York, and after the war, she spoke German, she went to work for the American military government through Clay, and in Clay's office.

25:35.907 --> 25:41.295
And she was an administrative assistant, and she had the idea with all the

25:41.613 --> 26:11.552
next generation of German youths that was what they should try to appeal to and there were no books so she asked Clay and she set up a little one room exhibit of a hundred books children's books and from that kept growing out of that grew this and her desire was that the next generation should not be penalized for the past generations

26:12.173 --> 26:23.388
And she was also herself kicked out of Germany, suffered, etc., came back and reseated the children's books thing and went on to start this collection which went around Germany.

26:23.428 --> 26:24.309
Did you give me her name?

26:25.050 --> 26:30.457
Do you have the international... Anyway, I think it's a great human interest story.

26:30.477 --> 26:30.998
It is, yeah.

26:31.018 --> 26:33.521
Well, it kind of fits into that other chapter, though.

26:33.541 --> 26:36.685
And... She left Germany?

26:37.306 --> 26:37.987
She's dead now.

26:38.207 --> 26:39.569
But why did she leave Germany?

26:39.629 --> 26:40.510
Because she's Jewish.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.662
So, what period is this?

26:42.682 --> 26:43.143
During the war.

26:43.343 --> 26:43.643
Nazi Germany.

26:43.663 --> 26:44.784
See, she'll fit into that chapter.

26:45.185 --> 26:45.285
Yeah.

26:45.305 --> 26:50.170
That second chapter of mine is just strictly on this, uh, it's not strictly American.

26:50.611 --> 26:51.111
Yeah.

26:51.752 --> 26:59.420
But the idea that here she is, left Germany, everybody got killed, and all the Jews.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.922
Now, how did you learn this history of her?

27:00.942 --> 27:01.883
Is it written someplace?

27:01.943 --> 27:03.184
Yeah.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.727
There's a little brochure that I think they have on it.

27:06.808 --> 27:08.090
And it's in what town?

27:08.110 --> 27:08.350
Munich.

27:08.570 --> 27:09.111
It's in Munich.

27:09.191 --> 27:10.092
I've got to go to Munich.

27:11.118 --> 27:13.882
because all of Barney's papers went to Munich.

27:15.564 --> 27:19.490
And it's about, oh, I'd say a 20-minute drive from the center of town.

27:20.912 --> 27:24.538
And you get a call, and I forget, there was a lady there.

27:25.559 --> 27:28.463
And occasionally I give a little money, because they don't have any.

27:28.543 --> 27:36.615
I haven't given it recently, but I was impressed with the... Do you have an address or anything, Ivy?

27:36.795 --> 27:39.960
I'm trying to call the aid.

27:40.312 --> 27:49.442
You mentioned, because I've come out to see this, that you're hopeful that there will be an exhibition of the arcs at UCLA.

27:49.562 --> 27:50.403
Yeah, UCLA.

27:51.224 --> 27:53.567
And who are you working with on that?

27:54.328 --> 28:03.718
The Dorn Ross, Dorns, the museum of... Fowler.

28:03.858 --> 28:04.639
Fowler Museum.

28:05.040 --> 28:05.781
Fowler?

28:05.801 --> 28:07.502
F-O-W-L-E-R.

28:07.543 --> 28:08.604
That's at UCLA?

28:08.624 --> 28:08.884
UCLA.

28:11.834 --> 28:13.215
How many arcs would you say you had?

28:13.796 --> 28:14.497
I have no idea.

28:14.957 --> 28:17.379
And when did that start?

28:17.620 --> 28:22.925
Well, for the children, we used to buy books, and I had a son named Noah.

28:23.205 --> 28:27.649
But we'd buy books on Noah's Ark for him, or something that had his name in it.

28:29.271 --> 28:39.241
And when he got killed, I kept buying maybe more books, and I started buying Noah material for a Noah collection.

28:39.261 --> 28:41.503
And I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it.

28:42.513 --> 28:52.888
And so I have the arcs, which don't quite belong in children's books, but I have the books in the arcs that separate it.

28:52.908 --> 28:54.510
So there was shelves in those.

28:54.531 --> 28:55.171
So I've seen them.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.456
Now, did they ultimately go into Princeton, or you haven't decided?

28:58.476 --> 29:01.200
I don't think Princeton would know what to do with Noah's arcs.

29:01.901 --> 29:04.205
And you probably didn't even know these things existed.

29:04.225 --> 29:07.930
I mean, some of those—I mean, I would have not—

29:08.703 --> 29:11.426
You must have just seen them as you traveled or heard about them.

29:11.947 --> 29:14.070
Oh, Noah's Ark and things like that.

29:14.090 --> 29:14.630
Yeah, I wasn't.

29:14.750 --> 29:15.652
I mean, they're not toys.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.753
How would you describe them?

29:16.773 --> 29:17.053
They are toys.

29:17.073 --> 29:17.814
They were toys.

29:20.978 --> 29:25.784
And they came out of a religious heritage, and I'm not a specialist in that.

29:25.924 --> 29:34.635
I noticed in the main Antique Digest, there's, you know, the 1800s Noah's Ark.

29:34.655 --> 29:34.795
Mm-hmm.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.483
They're $14,000, $15,000.

29:37.603 --> 29:37.883
Wow.

29:37.923 --> 29:41.908
I have a couple of modern ones that are close to that.

29:44.090 --> 29:48.075
But I'm not a— You still there?

29:48.956 --> 29:49.977
I'm still here.

29:50.237 --> 29:51.178
Okay, thank goodness.

29:51.198 --> 29:52.660
Do they come from all over the world?

29:52.920 --> 29:54.462
All over the world.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.744
I got just— I thought you have dealers looking for them?

29:56.764 --> 30:01.710
In Colorado, I just bought one on those aqua, the Christmas tree coming out of them, and the animals are hanging from the tree.

30:06.145 --> 30:35.325
great okay could you give him a copy of this letter I'll give you everything I think that you know I think unless you think there's something I haven't covered that I that you'd like to that you think is important that I missed no I'm trying to think I get pleasure from doing it I want to give some pleasure and I'm not the most avaricious collector

30:36.858 --> 30:44.106
I probably collect good and bad, which I shouldn't.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.969
You mean you're collecting habits, your skills?

30:46.989 --> 30:55.459
Yeah, I collect what I like sometimes, and it takes me a lot of discipline to pass by something that's, you know, maybe not pristine.

30:56.500 --> 30:56.961
It's interesting.

30:57.181 --> 31:02.747
I have a two-book contract with Holt, and the second one is it's going to be just about collecting.

31:03.031 --> 31:09.380
And I'm hoping to put in tips from people, not necessarily tips, but how certain people operate.

31:09.761 --> 31:16.591
Now, the way you have bought your books, you've really relied to a great extent on your booksellers, primarily Justin.

31:16.611 --> 31:17.252
Thank you, Ivy.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.355
I don't know.

31:19.696 --> 31:21.418
Ivy's been around for a while.

31:21.438 --> 31:24.963
Ivy, how much do I rely on Justin versus myself?

31:25.624 --> 31:30.051
Volume-wise, the number of books we have are mostly my pick, I'd say.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.357
80% are my pick.

31:32.377 --> 31:32.757
Oh, really?

31:34.879 --> 31:37.321
Now, the expensive ones may be Justin's.

31:38.923 --> 31:57.820
Justin has remarkable expertise on children's books generally, and when it comes to very rare items, when he's in any kind of doubt, Mr. Hudson consults with Justin.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.342
If I'm buying a seven-figure book, I'd ask Justin.

32:01.368 --> 32:03.190
Have you ever bought a seven-figure book?

32:03.730 --> 32:05.832
Which one is that?

32:05.852 --> 32:07.233
Doesn't make any difference.

32:07.734 --> 32:07.974
Oh, come on.

32:08.494 --> 32:09.235
One book, seven?

32:09.795 --> 32:12.618
Well, no, I have about a seven-figure book in my target.

32:12.638 --> 32:14.339
A seven-figure collection, certainly.

32:14.379 --> 32:16.201
You've bought it.

32:16.221 --> 32:18.563
That was the parole you mentioned yesterday.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.764
That's almost two.

32:20.425 --> 32:22.106
All right.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.129
I'll see.

32:25.309 --> 32:28.492
Some have come, oh, please.

32:28.512 --> 32:29.012
You were here?

32:29.613 --> 32:29.873
Yeah.

32:31.540 --> 32:37.526
There was one that, after the earthquake, I think, gee, the people upstairs have a tub if it overflows.

32:38.147 --> 32:41.009
So Ivy was putting umbrellas over these shelves.

32:41.370 --> 32:43.392
Were you affected by the earthquake?

32:43.452 --> 32:44.213
No, not really.

32:45.134 --> 32:45.954
No, we were very lucky.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.796
We didn't lose.

32:47.816 --> 32:49.618
A couple of books came off the shelf.

32:50.199 --> 32:53.862
A few shelves of books came down.

32:53.882 --> 33:01.530
He must be very virtuous, because we had a couple of small...

33:02.253 --> 33:07.799
to bindings of books that weren't worth repairing, really?

33:07.819 --> 33:15.648
I think the things that I've... I think Justin has kept me, I would say, on the highways.

33:16.509 --> 33:24.078
I've tended to go in the byways, but the books have, in a sense, reflected my tastes, or my wife's tastes.

33:24.198 --> 33:26.080
That's a great quote.

33:26.100 --> 33:31.787
And I think also I've had the vision of what the

33:32.645 --> 33:35.490
areas, maybe the building blocks, or what we should do.

33:36.192 --> 33:38.756
Has he helped you sharpen the focus?

33:38.776 --> 33:41.942
He's always been a pencil sharpener for me.

33:41.962 --> 33:45.930
And, of course, that's expertise that's valuable.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.955
Some people think he's very self-serving.

33:48.975 --> 33:51.761
I think he can be as self-serving as you want if you really know you need.

33:51.781 --> 33:55.227
Well, River, look at the collections of self-serving.

33:55.763 --> 33:58.466
I think you can't go wrong with quality.

33:58.486 --> 34:01.349
And you have to have one, and he certainly has his enemies out there, too.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.351
But you have to have them.

34:03.551 --> 34:04.972
You can't make them almost without breaking eggs.

34:04.992 --> 34:07.495
You can't stay up on the hill and not have enemies.

34:07.695 --> 34:09.037
Yeah, that's the way that goes.

34:09.057 --> 34:15.123
But I think, you know, there are a lot of different people in the business, and they all do different things.

34:15.683 --> 34:24.252
Some are good scouts, some are good in technology, some are good in vision, some are good at really knowledge, you know.

34:24.502 --> 34:29.430
Some are good in self, you know, acclimation.

34:29.570 --> 34:38.243
The press release from Princeton, which I briefly looked at, and you mentioned yesterday, and to this, you don't, it's been things to be asked.

34:40.026 --> 34:44.192
You said this will work out to be an eight figure.

34:44.813 --> 34:45.034
Yeah.

34:45.054 --> 34:47.678
That could be anything from 10 to 99.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.744
Could you give me an idea of where you think this will be?

34:51.764 --> 34:52.365
Well, I don't think...

34:53.442 --> 34:55.006
At this moment, it's not gonna be 99.

34:55.166 --> 34:59.255
It could, but it won't.

35:01.360 --> 35:07.835
So, and what this refers to is it's not just because we're all dazzled by numbers, because you said something yesterday.

35:08.476 --> 35:12.345
There was a time when I didn't think business was the end of the world.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.494
That's when you were being an architect.

35:14.554 --> 35:15.855
I never thought of business.

35:15.995 --> 35:17.758
But I think we're back to that now.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.822
You're out of the business, and you're really focusing.

35:20.842 --> 35:25.588
My children said I should get therapy because I feel so good about being out of something I did.

35:25.608 --> 35:28.772
I built as a child for 39, 40 years.

35:29.933 --> 35:36.602
So I built a business from $80,000 and sold it for close to a billion.

35:37.823 --> 35:38.364
Is that the number?

35:39.766 --> 35:40.026
Wow.

35:40.927 --> 35:41.708
That's a lot of money.

35:42.397 --> 35:43.339
Really?

35:44.842 --> 35:46.024
Yeah.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.386
I can't understand it myself.

35:48.008 --> 35:48.368
Wow.

35:50.092 --> 35:55.782
But you're doing, apparently, you're smiling.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.307
This must be giving me tremendous satisfaction.

35:58.447 --> 35:58.888
I do.

36:00.211 --> 36:00.792
I like books.

36:01.072 --> 36:02.255
Others like books.

36:02.836 --> 36:03.998
My brother's a doctor in Buffalo.

36:04.499 --> 36:05.080
What's his name?

36:05.498 --> 36:07.100
Robert Coatsen.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.742
Do you mind if I call him?

36:08.782 --> 36:10.043
No, and he has children's books.

36:10.163 --> 36:18.393
And he's really more discerning than I am, but his problem is his mind says $5 is his price limit, I'm making this up.

36:18.413 --> 36:20.055
And over $5 is mine.

36:20.696 --> 36:31.288
So, and we got, my wife and I got him interested in children's books, but he collects books in Civil War, early medical books, has a really, and he is buried in books.

36:32.029 --> 36:34.932
One time my wife said, why don't you and your brother go into the book business?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.124
have 47 Charing Cross, you know.

36:38.145 --> 36:38.345
Yeah.

36:38.625 --> 36:41.829
And I'd be the treasurer and he'd be the president.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.413
And I said to him, Bob, why don't you give up medicine?

36:44.813 --> 36:47.376
We'll do something.

36:47.396 --> 36:56.368
He's listed in the book, the physician and the book once I should have any trouble finding him.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.029
No.

36:57.629 --> 37:04.378
He treats, I can't remember what he calls them, book scouts for New York State, free.

37:04.932 --> 37:34.467
more or less and they feed him books yeah I love it so he's a collector oh yeah and it's children's books well he collects now I think he collects children's books Civil War books medical books geography geography and so he says I'll take any of you know I told you I have triplicates and duplicates any duplicates so I got you know shelves of

37:35.594 --> 37:37.936
Well, I saw the three syntax over there.

37:38.217 --> 37:40.018
I mean, why did you have three?

37:40.399 --> 37:43.362
Oh, those are probably three out of the six I have.

37:43.402 --> 37:51.530
But what I'm doing is I'm buying one each for all of my children, you know, like I showed you.

37:51.550 --> 37:55.333
And so I've tried to be sort of even-handed about it.

37:55.614 --> 38:02.480
There's one one something, and it was something that was in the Fatafoos and Denefers.

38:03.401 --> 38:05.263
So I had to buy, or the Munari books.

38:05.699 --> 38:10.666
So they're all brought up, and when ours had to get sets of all of them for them.

38:10.686 --> 38:11.387
Your grandchildren?

38:11.928 --> 38:12.108
Yes.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.335
Just four of them now.

38:17.216 --> 38:18.017
I think we're set.

38:18.598 --> 38:18.778
Okay.

38:18.798 --> 38:25.829
And, you know, this is my next job.

38:25.849 --> 38:27.491
So you've got a want list here.

38:27.511 --> 38:35.503
It's when we were very young, now we are six, Winnie the Pooh, house of Pooh Corner,

38:35.922 --> 38:38.945
Peter and Jane and N-O-D-D-Y.

38:39.245 --> 38:45.050
These are six titles that your daughter sent.

38:45.591 --> 39:00.465
When my wife and I in the early years, we used to put out books called The Occasional Press, and we'd do little chapbooks for the children or alphabet things.

39:00.945 --> 39:04.208
I don't know if we have any around, but...

39:05.032 --> 39:05.773
Do we have any here?

39:06.533 --> 39:06.774
Yeah.

39:07.354 --> 39:08.695
Should we show them one?

39:08.715 --> 39:09.015
Sure.

39:09.136 --> 39:10.357
It's in the other unit, though.

39:10.377 --> 39:10.437
Oh.

39:11.237 --> 39:12.158
You want to see what we've got?

39:12.198 --> 39:12.458
May I?

39:12.478 --> 39:12.939
Sure.

39:12.959 --> 39:13.139
Sure.

39:13.159 --> 39:17.142
I came to get one.

39:17.243 --> 39:25.630
I was, uh, came and the guy said, well, I'll give you a glass of champagne and you can catch the afternoon plane back to L.A.

39:25.670 --> 39:28.412
And I said, I'm here to work in the factory and on the floor.

39:29.093 --> 39:34.077
Well, after a few bottles of champagne, nine in the morning, uh,

39:34.276 --> 39:40.804
He realized I was going to stay, and I stayed for six weeks, and I learned how to make it.

39:41.004 --> 39:44.168
But my first assignment was in a dungeon with two guys.

39:44.228 --> 39:47.392
One was Flemish, and one was called the Company Idiot.

39:48.293 --> 39:56.123
And it was about the size of that area in there, 12 by 12, which had like a rack, a mechanical rack on it.

39:56.383 --> 39:58.526
It had an archery target and had a small window.

39:59.447 --> 40:00.629
And I knew what the window was for.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.249
That was light.

40:01.269 --> 40:02.511
It looked like a prison cell.

40:03.385 --> 40:04.707
I knew what the rack was for.

40:04.767 --> 40:06.889
There was a sort of slicing machine.

40:06.909 --> 40:10.554
There were big cakes like cheese with a wire bow.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.698
I didn't know what the archery target was for.

40:13.718 --> 40:19.265
So here are these two guys, five feet, five, big 200 pounds, both wooden clogs.

40:21.007 --> 40:22.789
And I asked, what was the archery?

40:22.809 --> 40:23.970
And they said, like this.

40:25.012 --> 40:30.138
And they both get this bow in there, this bow like, and they take the wire cutter through the bar.

40:30.639 --> 40:33.342
And as it goes through the end of this huge cake,

40:33.811 --> 40:38.576
goes twang, and, you know, 500 pounds goes against the wall.

40:38.596 --> 40:39.758
And they had to out shoot targets.

40:39.798 --> 40:44.063
So my note to myself was, have to change this process to the American.

40:45.064 --> 40:57.518
But anyway, you know, when they introduced me to the village or the company idiot, I heard him say something, and I realized I understood it.

40:58.399 --> 41:00.021
What he was speaking was Albanian.

41:00.372 --> 41:01.153
It's very close.

41:01.474 --> 41:05.782
And I understood Albanian because my Greek workmen were from Albania.

41:05.802 --> 41:08.688
So I started talking to him.

41:08.908 --> 41:15.681
Next day, all around through the factory there, the Plemish factory, there were two company idiots, him and me.

41:16.758 --> 41:19.281
Oh, Albanian is very, very close to it.

41:19.441 --> 41:21.763
Well, no, it's a really, it's a different root language.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.586
It is, but, I mean, the Greeks, they're up in that part of it.

41:24.606 --> 41:25.587
Oh, yeah, they're all mixed.

41:25.607 --> 41:27.689
They're called Epidotes.

41:27.710 --> 41:28.931
Right, and they all come down.

41:29.471 --> 41:32.675
They've been coming down, and they've been in the Peloponnesian now.

41:33.075 --> 41:38.301
They're going, spreading out in the islands because there's no money in Albanian.

41:38.521 --> 41:42.445
My mother's side is from the Peloponnesos down in Mani.

41:42.610 --> 42:03.041
It's not because he wanted to close, they just like tripled his rent, you know, and he just couldn't afford to do it.

42:03.061 --> 42:05.565
And there really is not a good Greek restaurant in Boston now.

42:05.585 --> 42:07.167
There's not a good Greek restaurant here.

42:07.619 --> 42:10.123
That one I went to a couple of years ago is pretty good.

42:12.246 --> 42:12.606
I forget the name.

42:12.626 --> 42:21.800
There is a new place on 3rd, down towards near La Brea, and it's called Sophie's.

42:22.541 --> 42:25.345
S-O-F-I-E, I think.

42:25.365 --> 42:25.846
Sophia.

42:26.787 --> 42:29.632
Yeah, but it's called Sophie's, and it's a Greek restaurant.

42:30.693 --> 42:33.237
Anyway, these were... You made these?

42:33.257 --> 42:33.357
Yeah.

42:34.180 --> 42:42.188
This is called A Latter-day, L-A-T-T-E-I-day, Chapbook, An Alphabet of Wishes from the Clotson Family, Lloyd, Joanne, Clarina.

42:42.208 --> 42:43.770
That could be a Greek name, too, you know.

42:43.790 --> 42:44.971
It is a Greek name, yes.

42:44.991 --> 42:45.451
Little girl.

42:45.992 --> 42:46.152
Yeah.

42:46.873 --> 42:50.857
Toby, Toby, E-Y, Eric, and you are published by the Occasional Press.

42:50.877 --> 42:51.638
Is this your press?

42:52.278 --> 42:52.859
No, it wasn't.

42:52.899 --> 42:55.041
We just had it printed by some commercial printers.

42:57.424 --> 42:59.906
And these things that you wrote that you wrote?

43:00.146 --> 43:00.627
Yeah, yeah.

43:00.647 --> 43:01.808
My wife did most of this.

43:04.201 --> 43:07.425
If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride.

43:08.146 --> 43:15.415
We wish you art, adventures, assurance, ability, appetite, and, oh, it goes on to the next one, B, we wish you blessings.

43:15.495 --> 43:16.336
This is very clever.

43:17.317 --> 43:19.300
Well, the clever part is my wife's.

43:19.320 --> 43:26.969
And then finally it ends up with Z, we wish you zeal, zest, xenocrelation, whatever one wishes it to me.

43:27.230 --> 43:30.273
Z-Y-N-O-C-R-I-L-L-A-T-I-U-R.

43:30.413 --> 43:33.297
It's 28 pages on this page.

43:33.952 --> 43:34.753
The date here, 1973.

43:34.773 --> 43:38.919
Now, did you send these out as Christmas greetings?

43:40.642 --> 43:41.042
Lovely.

43:42.124 --> 43:43.466
I'm glad you showed me these.

43:43.806 --> 43:45.569
How often did you do these?

43:45.649 --> 43:46.150
Once a year?

43:46.230 --> 43:48.253
Once a generation.

43:48.273 --> 43:50.256
The tragical death of an apple pie.

43:51.137 --> 43:52.900
And you wrote these as a family?

43:52.920 --> 43:53.020
Yeah.

43:53.561 --> 43:54.843
And produced them as a family?

43:54.863 --> 43:56.265
They made chop marks and prints.

43:56.365 --> 43:57.867
I think this one here may have been.

43:58.100 --> 44:01.883
And how many of these do you think you did, half a dozen, a dozen?

44:01.903 --> 44:04.085
No, we'd probably print it up, 100, 200.

44:04.786 --> 44:06.508
I mean, but how many different roles?

44:08.109 --> 44:10.111
Two I can see, but I don't know how many more.

44:10.531 --> 44:18.278
The tragical death of an apple pie, which was cut to pieces and eaten by 26 persons, with whom all young folks ought to be well acquainted.

44:18.298 --> 44:19.399
A, apple pie.

44:19.539 --> 44:20.180
B, bit it.

44:20.360 --> 44:20.921
C, cut it.

44:21.361 --> 44:22.342
D, dealt it.

44:22.362 --> 44:22.883
E, eat it.

44:23.543 --> 44:24.564
F, fought for it.

44:24.624 --> 44:26.706
G, got it all the way through to

44:28.222 --> 44:32.870
viewed it, wanted it, and then X, Y, and Z, and all wished for peace in hand.

44:32.890 --> 44:33.351
That's lovely.

44:35.134 --> 44:36.296
Are they all alphabet?

44:39.883 --> 44:39.963
Yes.

44:39.983 --> 44:45.392
It's written in 1974, an edition of 500, by the occasional press, Beverly Hills, California.

44:46.835 --> 44:48.478
Thank you for bringing me that.

44:48.538 --> 44:50.882
Yes, there he is.

44:50.902 --> 44:52.565
Okay, do you need to be back here?

44:52.585 --> 44:53.166
I will.

44:53.770 --> 44:54.475
I'll be in touch.

44:54.616 --> 44:54.898
Okay.

44:54.938 --> 44:56.831
And maybe I'll see you up in Sanford.

44:56.851 --> 44:58.059
Yeah, I'm going to be walking around.

44:58.079 --> 44:58.562
Thanks.

44:59.589 --> 44:59.730
Thanks.
