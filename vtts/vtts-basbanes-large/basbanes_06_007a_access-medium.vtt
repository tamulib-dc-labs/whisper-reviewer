WEBVTT

00:03.693 --> 00:15.489
This is side three, take two of the Brodsky interview, and we have a new individual who's joined us, and I wonder, Bob, if you could just give your full name and spell it for my title.

00:17.131 --> 00:21.758
Robert W. Hamblin, H-A-M-B-L-I-N.

00:23.720 --> 00:23.981
Okay.

00:25.423 --> 00:26.424
And what do you do here?

00:26.444 --> 00:31.491
I'm a professor of English at Southeast Missouri State University, Cape Girardeau.

00:31.571 --> 00:32.232
And I...

00:32.549 --> 00:40.422
I understand that you were influential in bringing, arranging for the transfer of Brotsky collection here to the University.

00:40.442 --> 00:54.304
Well, I met LD in 1978, I believe it was, and we worked together for the next dozen years on the materials, doing books, exhibits, articles, and the...

00:54.993 --> 01:03.872
His decision to place the materials at the university in part was a culmination of our decade and more work with the materials.

01:04.153 --> 01:11.348
You were aware of course that he had been talking to other institutions like Yale and Mississippi and Virginia.

01:11.949 --> 01:15.617
So did it come as a surprise to you that

01:15.817 --> 01:18.262
Yes, indeed.

01:18.422 --> 01:20.245
It was quite a surprise.

01:20.406 --> 01:29.202
We were seated in this room, in fact, having lunch with the president of the University Bill Stacy at that time, then president.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.204
He's in California now.

01:30.224 --> 01:34.753
We were having lunch here one day, and in the course of our conversation,

01:36.235 --> 01:40.321
Eldie said, Bill, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.

01:40.822 --> 01:45.228
I think it's time to consider placing the collection here on a permanent basis.

01:45.368 --> 01:48.653
And I heard it fell out of my chair, I think.

01:49.174 --> 01:52.359
And I said to Bill, you're hearing this for the first time.

01:52.399 --> 01:54.722
I'm hearing it for the first time just as you are.

01:54.762 --> 01:56.485
Eldie's never said anything like this to me.

01:56.925 --> 01:59.509
I was aware, of course, that he was talking to other institutions.

02:00.029 --> 02:02.012
He had never talked to us previously.

02:02.593 --> 02:03.394
We had never asked.

02:04.356 --> 02:05.838
I had never suggested that.

02:06.539 --> 02:09.063
In fact, I pretty much stayed out of that aspect.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.247
Why had you never asked?

02:11.267 --> 02:18.398
Well, I felt myself very fortunate as a Faulkner scholar just to have the opportunity to work for 10 years or so with this caliber of material.

02:18.719 --> 02:23.286
And Eldie and I first started, what developed early on was a very close friendship.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.032
Even before we got deeply into the

02:27.434 --> 02:43.080
Faulkner materials the publishing and all I mean we enjoyed each other's company we saw a lot of each other and and I just didn't I mean he'd given me a wonderful opportunity to work with these materials and I thought it would be a

02:43.870 --> 02:49.576
rather ungracious of me to try to influence him on where the material should go.

02:49.816 --> 02:52.759
I was not privy to that kind of discussion.

02:52.779 --> 03:02.128
And even after Stacy and LD began the negotiations about the placing of the materials here, I was not involved in very much of that at all.

03:02.728 --> 03:08.094
I'm going to intrude just long enough to say that it's that kind of attitude that I very much appreciated.

03:08.134 --> 03:11.717
The fact that there was no pushiness

03:12.372 --> 03:17.200
from anyone here, ever, and that when things were done, there was an appreciation.

03:17.861 --> 03:21.087
I liked that, and I felt that was really respectful of me.

03:21.107 --> 03:34.971
As a graduate of Ole Miss, having done my master's in doctor's there, and then looking at Texas and Yale and Mississippi, my preference personally all along, since I really didn't think that we were in the running for the collection at all, that's a good idea.

03:35.238 --> 03:45.576
I guess if I had a personal preference in those years, Ole Miss probably would have been the school that I would have hoped the collection might go to.

03:45.616 --> 03:52.268
When that didn't work out and the LD approached us here, then of course I got very excited about the prospects.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.603
for Southeast.

03:54.623 --> 04:09.546
But up to that time, I think, I guess I'd always assumed and maybe hoped that the collection would go to Ole Miss as my alma mater.

04:09.566 --> 04:21.023
You were aware of questions that you must have certainly learned at some point that there were stumbling blocks, difficulties made by these other institutions.

04:22.133 --> 04:31.587
Have you had to come up with some kind of

04:32.680 --> 04:55.313
package I guess. It just wouldn't come to the university I guess I think. You were aware that you had to make LD happy. Well there were things here concerned with those things at all. Or if he was telling you, that wasn't his concern. I've said it but when you broached the subject at that point that that did you like the collection here

04:55.715 --> 04:58.799
But that was broached to Stacy, the president, and not to me.

04:58.879 --> 04:59.721
I was not involved.

04:59.741 --> 05:03.466
But I think what I recognized as L.D.

05:03.526 --> 05:08.152
and Bill talked, and I was not present in that negotiation.

05:08.272 --> 05:15.422
You know, there were lawyers and accountants, and I was not party to any of that.

05:15.442 --> 05:16.103
But...

05:16.690 --> 05:30.784
what i recognized from the point of view of president stacy was that this institution is at a transitional stage in its history and they're looking for various ways to to become more prestigious they're going to division one in athletics for example they are

05:31.034 --> 05:35.238
They are trying to create a national reputation.

05:35.419 --> 05:39.263
And so the coincidence, if you want to look at that, of L.D.

05:39.303 --> 05:46.030
speaking to Bill at a time when Stacy was looking for opportunities to put this institution on the map.

05:46.070 --> 05:46.550
That's right.

05:46.670 --> 05:49.994
And Stacy went for it.

05:50.014 --> 05:52.937
And because if you're number two, you try harder.

05:53.798 --> 05:59.944
And maybe when you get right down to it, Ole Miss and Yale and institutions that already have established

05:59.924 --> 06:07.471
Faulkner collections and so-called major universities, maybe they didn't have to push quite as hard.

06:07.511 --> 06:12.027
And so I think when Stacy saw the opportunity here for what this collection could do for this institution,

06:12.648 --> 06:16.514
He got right to work on it, and I believe it was just a matter of a few months.

06:17.175 --> 06:21.301
I mean, LD had been negotiating, talking at least to some of these other institutions for several years.

06:21.401 --> 06:25.147
When Stacy got involved in this project, the deal was wrapped up in about six months.

06:25.167 --> 06:39.668
And I think it had to do largely with not only LD's interest at that point in placing the collection here, but the fact that Stacy saw an opportunity to do something of national prominence, even international prominence.

06:39.648 --> 06:46.001
And that all tied in with what was being perceived at that time to be the changing mission of this institution.

06:46.283 --> 06:48.072
Would you say that...

06:49.267 --> 06:53.914
the Barton Collection is the major special collection at the university?

06:54.575 --> 06:54.755
Yes.

06:56.518 --> 06:57.659
Nothing here to robbery.

06:58.541 --> 07:05.070
So that's... It is Division I. It's the equivalent of Division I in athletics.

07:05.130 --> 07:11.419
And you asked me about my ego, and I told you that I had no sense of ego involved in this.

07:11.439 --> 07:18.109
The fact that it is of premier importance on this campus does not give me any kind of an ego inflation at all.

07:18.511 --> 07:19.152
I don't care.

07:19.232 --> 07:20.635
I come down here and I work with Bob.

07:20.695 --> 07:21.957
None of the kids know me down here.

07:22.539 --> 07:23.921
The people were very nice to me here.

07:23.941 --> 07:25.224
They've given me a few honors.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.506
Well, those honors are just honors.

07:26.526 --> 07:28.369
I don't really thrive on honors.

07:28.790 --> 07:29.371
I never have.

07:29.812 --> 07:31.896
I thrive on accomplishment.

07:32.264 --> 07:38.557
And the best thing I've had down here is considerable respect from people who've read about the collection in the paper here or what have you.

07:38.577 --> 07:41.764
But as far as it being an ego thing for me, it is not.

07:42.105 --> 07:46.895
It makes me feel great that it's real important here and that it has an opportunity to do something for this university.

07:47.636 --> 07:48.438
That's why I put it here.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.825
Washington, you gave me the impression that it wouldn't do much for them.

07:52.092 --> 07:55.097
Beinecke, Yale gave me the impression it wouldn't do much for them.

07:55.117 --> 07:55.979
They were too great already.

07:56.399 --> 07:57.742
Virginia, the same thing.

07:57.762 --> 08:01.027
Well, I told you before in the car, fuck them.

08:01.789 --> 08:02.830
You know, I mean it.

08:02.850 --> 08:07.719
I want someone, but not for my ego, to be able to derive a strong benefit from it.

08:07.739 --> 08:10.904
And in fact, we can bring people from Amsterdam and from Germany.

08:11.345 --> 08:12.908
And who knows the untold people?

08:13.248 --> 08:15.973
I've had letters from Russia now, from Iraq

08:16.747 --> 08:38.248
on the collection. Oh by the way i have a great piece of news to share with you editor handler and you'll enjoy this one. I affected I got the facts in my attache. I affected Country Lawyer and Stallion Road are the next two that are going in the French translation and but sure but soon. Congratulations. ALl right. We've got two more French titles coming.

08:38.752 --> 08:39.513
It's wonderful.

08:39.533 --> 08:40.654
I'm really excited about that.

08:41.055 --> 08:41.775
They came around.

08:41.795 --> 08:42.596
They have.

08:42.977 --> 08:45.119
I forced them into coming around nicely on that.

08:45.139 --> 08:46.280
I'll tell you that whole story later.

08:46.781 --> 08:47.422
They came around.

08:47.462 --> 08:50.565
In fact, they're publishing three of my poetry books.

08:50.585 --> 08:52.607
They're going to take, they're going to publish three volumes.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.412
The Thorough Earth and 4 and 20 Blackbirds Soaring, Volume 1.

08:57.973 --> 09:01.717
Volume 2, You Can't Go Back Exactly and Mississippi Vistas together.

09:02.218 --> 09:05.241
Each of those makes 150 page books in French translation.

09:05.261 --> 09:07.003
Volume 3, Falling from Heaven.

09:07.203 --> 09:07.804
Good for you.

09:07.944 --> 09:11.749
Holocaust poems of a Jew and a Gentile, 112 poems, coming out in volume three.

09:12.690 --> 09:17.917
Coming out April 92, October 92, and April 93.

09:19.178 --> 09:20.099
Is that a whopper?

09:20.119 --> 09:20.760
That stuff.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.022
I have to go to Paris for that.

09:22.202 --> 09:22.763
You betcha.

09:22.903 --> 09:24.585
Invite me to the party, please, will you?

09:24.605 --> 09:25.045
You bet.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.107
You can come along.

09:26.127 --> 09:28.029
But we got two more Faulkner books working.

09:28.049 --> 09:28.310
Nice.

09:29.010 --> 09:29.832
And then I got other stuff.

09:29.852 --> 09:31.514
That's why I need to come down and work with you next week.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.555
Okay, keep us going.

09:32.795 --> 09:33.396
Okay, Bob.

09:34.135 --> 09:50.454
You're a Faulkner Scholar, and all of a sudden, you've been here 20 years, the institution becomes a primary repository for Faulkner material.

09:51.456 --> 09:54.359
Tell me a little bit about how that makes you feel.

09:54.739 --> 09:55.560
Well, it's staggering.

09:55.580 --> 10:03.670
I remember I've written about the first time I saw the collection in Farmington, and it was about half the size then as it is now.

10:04.460 --> 10:12.095
But I had left Ole Miss, had finished my dissertation on Faulkner.

10:12.115 --> 10:15.081
I thought I was sort of tired of Faulkner, actually, at that point.

10:15.222 --> 10:17.406
That would have been 77 or 78.

10:17.875 --> 10:27.815
And I had, after I'd finished that dissertation, I checked in all the Faulkner books and checked out some books on Robert Frost, and I actually wrote the first paragraph of an essay.

10:28.357 --> 10:38.297
He said, one of the things that has enabled

10:38.834 --> 10:47.324
One of the things that's enabled us, I think, to keep up some enthusiasm, not only for working together, maybe, but for the Faulkner material, is we have other projects.

10:47.344 --> 10:51.690
Of course, he has his poetry, and I do other things as well.

10:51.770 --> 10:57.477
And so when we get a little burned out on the Faulkner, a little tired, fatigued, we just turn to the other projects.

10:57.577 --> 11:00.681
I do a lot of sports literature.

11:00.741 --> 11:03.444
He does his own poetry.

11:04.866 --> 11:05.787
So it's...

11:07.049 --> 11:21.987
keep a little variety, and the one thing I always worried about throughout my academic career is becoming a damn specialist, and I guess this is, I may appear to be a specialist, but I do other things as well.

11:22.607 --> 11:34.221
Bob is a wonderful poet, and he is now, has been for a few years the poetry editor of Athlon, which is real nice, and he's been real involved in sports literature.

11:34.758 --> 11:38.942
It's interesting to me, Bill Hayen is also very interested in that.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.524
We're bringing him down to St.

11:40.624 --> 11:41.325
Louis next week.

11:41.345 --> 11:46.991
I'm hoping maybe you'll come up if I can't come down, but I want you to meet him for sure.

11:47.011 --> 11:48.572
I think it's real important.

11:49.874 --> 11:55.679
I've also recently started writing about some of the 1960s at Ole Miss when I was there.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.124
I was federalized with the National Guard during the Meredith integration.

12:00.543 --> 12:05.616
My graduate school days were in those mid-sixties when Ole Miss was dealing with integration.

12:05.676 --> 12:10.890
There were some racial demonstrations on campus, and I produced a couple of articles.

12:10.972 --> 12:21.562
They're part memory, but also I've had access to letters and historical documents, and so it's kind of reconstructing some of those events.

12:22.943 --> 12:37.857
What I'm working on now is the history of the 1965 Southern Literary Festival, which was held at Ole Miss, and there was a racial demonstration because the black delegation from Tugally attended, and it's interesting to

12:38.680 --> 12:41.825
to reconstruct history, especially if you were there at the time.

12:41.905 --> 12:45.550
And it's not deja vu because you see things now that you didn't see then.

12:45.590 --> 12:53.221
You're seeing behind the scenes and using the documents, the letters that the university has provided for me.

12:53.321 --> 12:57.027
And let me keep those.

12:57.888 --> 13:08.063
So the last several weeks, I've been devoting a little bit of my time to interviewing people in Oxford and writing that article.

13:08.650 --> 13:10.295
I'm going to get you back on the other track.

13:10.315 --> 13:15.509
We hope the Journal of Mississippi History will bring out a special issue.

13:15.729 --> 13:21.445
They do special numbers sometimes devoted, like monographs, and that's Ole Miss is willing to

13:21.712 --> 13:23.555
subsidize it to a certain extent.

13:23.575 --> 13:25.358
Our institution here would do the same.

13:25.858 --> 13:28.823
Are you a Mississippi native?

13:28.843 --> 13:28.963
Yeah.

13:28.983 --> 13:35.433
So Faulkner to you is... Well, but I never read Faulkner until I got to graduate school at Ole Miss.

13:35.473 --> 13:37.216
We didn't read him in high school.

13:37.236 --> 13:38.698
He was not highly regarded.

13:39.179 --> 13:41.362
We're all about the same generation.

13:41.603 --> 13:41.863
Right.

13:42.265 --> 13:50.332
But I studied Faulkner in a seminar with John Pilkington, a noted Faulkner scholar.

13:51.253 --> 13:55.456
It's debated whether Pilkington or Carville Collins was the first to teach a Faulkner seminar.

13:56.818 --> 14:01.922
But Pilkington was teaching his Faulkner seminar when I was a graduate student at Ole Miss, and I took that.

14:02.062 --> 14:06.546
And that's really the first time I really got deeply into Faulkner.

14:06.566 --> 14:10.990
I had studied Faulkner as an undergraduate student with Dan Young at Delta State.

14:11.206 --> 14:16.553
He later wound up at Vanderbilt and was a very fine Faulkner Scholar, Southern Lit Scholar, T.D.

14:16.813 --> 14:17.815
Thomas Daniel Young.

14:19.517 --> 14:23.602
So I read Faulkner in Dan Young's Southern Lit Class at Delta State.

14:23.682 --> 14:26.927
I think it was As I Lay Dying, a couple of the stories.

14:27.628 --> 14:33.475
But it wasn't really until I got to Ole Miss with Pilkington that I got deeply into Faulkner.

14:33.495 --> 14:34.977
Same kind of thing that happened to L.D.

14:35.158 --> 14:37.821
at Yale, and once you get hooked.

14:38.746 --> 14:40.728
I did my master's thesis on Faulkner.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.590
I did my doctorate dissertation on Faulkner.

14:42.710 --> 14:46.675
I published a couple of pieces of that dissertation and then I met L.D.

14:47.936 --> 14:51.300
One of the best things that ever happened in my whole life was meeting Bob.

14:52.441 --> 14:53.983
That really changed everything.

14:54.063 --> 15:01.311
I think I told you to some extent in the car that his call and then our beginnings together, I mentioned

15:01.814 --> 15:29.087
Nick how you had asked me and of course as the years go by we distill this into into just a few catch phrases but I've distilled it into that one question that you asked me well what are you going to do with all this LD and that and of course it was more complex than that because he and I are more articulate than that but in the final analysis it was that question that I kept coming back to repeatedly so that Bob and I began to share and he suggested

15:29.236 --> 15:31.480
Why don't we do an exhibit here at this university?

15:32.080 --> 15:35.806
And we created what wasn't such a modest exhibit.

15:35.826 --> 15:37.449
It was the fourth big exhibit I'd done.

15:37.469 --> 15:45.041
I told you about the one at Washington U in the 60s, and then the two in the 60s, the one at the Public Library at St.

15:45.061 --> 15:48.286
Louis, and then the one at Washington U, and then the one in the 70s.

15:49.708 --> 15:56.779
The one Bob and I created here in 1979 yielded a book, our first book.

15:57.215 --> 16:13.025
What started out to be just a little record of that exhibit turned out to be the inchoate core of a larger bibliography that we would develop, and it was called a descriptive catalog, wasn't it?

16:13.045 --> 16:16.692
No, the Louis Daniel Brodsky Collection, or something like that.

16:16.975 --> 16:25.006
selections from, and it turned out to be not just a catalog of what was in the exhibit, did it?

16:25.247 --> 16:26.408
But rather the highlights.

16:26.608 --> 16:32.917
By that time, Bob and I, he'd only been working with me for about a year, and we assessed what the highlights were at that time.

16:33.478 --> 16:40.688
So it would be real interesting to take that book published in 1979 by University of Virginia Press,

16:41.090 --> 16:45.797
and compare it with what we will do with the final bibliography in the 90s.

16:47.078 --> 16:51.144
It should be just staggering to see how advanced the collection became.

16:51.204 --> 17:02.440
Now, the collection grew by leaps and bounds once I met Bob, because he gave me the opportunity to put in place a raison d'etre.

17:02.707 --> 17:11.323
And that was that I wanted to continue collecting, and I wanted to work with Bob, and together we would collaborate on making books about the collection.

17:11.604 --> 17:14.109
Did he point you in any directions for things to go after?

17:14.249 --> 17:26.031
Well, he didn't do that so much as just suggested in the beginning how significant it might be for us to take a lot of the artifacts already in the collection and highlight those in articles.

17:26.483 --> 17:30.128
and then in the books so that people could see what we had and could use it.

17:30.889 --> 17:39.281
So one of the early things we did, Bob wrote an early article that appeared in Studies and Bibliography on our 1940 William Faulkner will.

17:40.282 --> 17:41.784
He wrote that solo.

17:41.804 --> 17:43.526
And after that I said, hey, that's pretty neat.

17:43.546 --> 17:45.209
That may have come out in 78 or 79.

17:45.269 --> 17:45.890
I can't remember.

17:47.211 --> 17:48.133
I said, wow, that's neat.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.296
I said, Bob, let's collaborate on one.

17:50.316 --> 17:52.018
So the next one we worked on together.

17:52.522 --> 17:59.491
appeared in studies and bibliography, maybe in 1980, and it was on one of our manuscripts called L'Opéra Medie d'un Fan.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.133
Now, that's real butchered French.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.398
But it was Faulkner's first published poem.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.940
It appeared in the New Republic in 1919.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.781
Spell it.

18:09.263 --> 18:12.647
L'Opéra Medie d'un Fan.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.309
And we'll show you that title.

18:14.329 --> 18:20.537
But what was significant about this was that this had come out of William Faulkner's mother's home, the manuscript, from the attic.

18:20.973 --> 18:22.675
out of one of Faulkner's trunks.

18:23.236 --> 18:41.060
It had been on a cover of a magazine that when Bob went to work investigatively, he was able to discover that it was a Saturday evening post from a specific date that Faulkner had most likely scribbled on up in Canada while he was still taking his pilot training in Toronto.

18:41.541 --> 18:49.191
So he and I together did investigation, and we then worked on a textual study of the poem.

18:49.407 --> 18:51.591
And it excited me so much.

18:52.152 --> 18:54.075
He brought to it much talent that I didn't have.

18:54.576 --> 18:57.561
A lot of his background was in the scholarship.

18:57.821 --> 18:58.642
Mine had not been.

18:58.682 --> 19:02.268
I had been a collector and a writer.

19:02.288 --> 19:11.764
I think what happened early on in the collaboration, first of all, I thought we'd do the one exhibit and the one book, and that would probably be the end of the collaboration.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.048
I mean, neither one of us foresaw that...

19:14.416 --> 19:25.167
First of all, that the collection would continue to grow almost geometric proportions the way it did, or that we would continue for 10 years or so as collaborators.

19:25.388 --> 19:35.899
Again, it was honor enough at that point for this institution to be able to host that three-month exhibit and to have a book associated with the university published by the University of Virginia Press.

19:35.939 --> 19:40.283
We just hadn't thought that there would be anything beyond that particularly.

19:40.303 --> 19:41.925
There didn't need to be.

19:42.395 --> 19:54.252
As we continue to work together, and what happened as we did the articles and so on, what surfaced was that there was a need for the collection to focus more and more on manuscript material as opposed to books.

19:55.013 --> 20:01.382
If it was going to sustain the scholarship, you know, the books are beautiful and it's the finest Faulkner book collection in the world.

20:01.818 --> 20:07.607
In fact, they're more inscribed books by Faulkner in this collection than in all the other Faulkner collections put together.

20:09.010 --> 20:20.729
So as a book collection, it's very valuable, it's very beautiful, it's very significant, but the books will not sustain the level of scholarship and research that letters, wills, manuscripts.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.133
And so when L.D.

20:23.173 --> 20:28.922
got turned on to writing articles and publishing,

20:29.493 --> 20:35.685
And that created a necessity for him to focus more on manuscript material than he had done previously.

20:36.046 --> 20:46.105
So the Hollywood and the Hollywood film scripts became available, for example, that opened up a whole new, well, so far four new volumes, you see, and more to come.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.147
So I think there was a...

20:48.055 --> 20:59.345
just a natural development as he changed his focus from collecting to scholarship, then that naturally sent the collection into a different direction.

20:59.365 --> 21:03.088
He had to build those parts of the collection that sustained the scholarship.

21:03.108 --> 21:07.592
I want to add something to that, if I can, if you bring that over there.

21:07.612 --> 21:15.579
I think what happened to me, I've already told you, too, about the sense of dynamism that has to be in collecting for me here, and that is that I was meeting people.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.961
What happened is, in meeting Bob,

21:18.430 --> 21:33.070
A friendship grew that was more important, that finally was transcendent to the collecting and to the scholarship, so that I was deriving immense pleasure out of working with Bob, making the books.

21:33.090 --> 21:35.273
Everything was sort of feeding into itself.

21:35.433 --> 21:43.003
Yes, it was really gratifying to make these scholarly books, but the turn-on for me was sharing in the endeavor.

21:43.574 --> 21:53.078
of mining the material, of writing the manuscripts that made the book, creating the manuscript for the book, for each of these books that we published.

21:53.779 --> 21:56.065
We ended up, we've now published seven books,

21:56.315 --> 21:59.479
with University Press of Mississippi, and we have a contract for six more.

22:00.140 --> 22:02.704
And we will doubtless make those in the next six, seven years.

22:03.605 --> 22:06.509
So even though we didn't get the collection, there's still no high-feeling stuff.

22:06.529 --> 22:11.936
Well, no, because U Press of Mississippi publishes for all the Mississippi universities, not just Ole Miss at Oxford.

22:12.457 --> 22:18.805
But the real thrill, I repeat, was in the sharing of the endeavor, and that's what.

22:18.905 --> 22:23.211
Bob never once said, well, you need to go out and get more letters, or you need to get more manuscripts so we can keep going.

22:23.231 --> 22:24.853
Matter of fact, quite the contrary.

22:24.935 --> 22:26.657
I think I always used to beleaguer him.

22:27.097 --> 22:35.947
I'd come back with a new trover, I'd give him a buzz, and I'd say, Robert, I'd say, you're not going to believe it, but I just came back from such and such, and I brought home some bacon.

22:36.027 --> 22:39.431
I've always told LD that I've got the whole collaboration.

22:39.511 --> 22:48.040
I feel like the person who's running to catch on to the caboose, you know, the train's pulling out of the station, and this fellow has so much energy, and I'm...

22:48.543 --> 22:53.948
and drive, and I was so active in the collecting.

22:54.709 --> 23:01.955
It was difficult for me at times just to keep up, just in carding the material, or if we were working on articles.

23:02.095 --> 23:15.788
And so when he would come with a new cache of materials, and I was happy, but I also sometimes tended to feel rather frustrated because there are not enough lifetimes, you know, to deal with all of this.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.550
And so it just,

23:18.530 --> 23:26.261
There were times when I just, as I say, felt like I was trying to run along the track and trying to get back on the train.

23:26.281 --> 23:32.069
That's kind of a rather unusual experience for a scholar and an academic.

23:32.089 --> 23:35.313
Generally you get collections and then you take it from there.

23:35.754 --> 23:41.702
But you were kind of involved in the building of a collection, I guess, or you were witness to the building of a collection.

23:41.682 --> 23:46.449
Well, I'd never worked with a collector.

23:46.489 --> 23:48.372
I'd never known a book collector before.

23:48.593 --> 23:54.962
Like many people, I had this stereotype of some older person.

23:55.022 --> 23:56.885
I was really surprised when I first met L.D.

23:56.905 --> 24:00.471
when he walked into the bank there in Farmington, how young he was.

24:01.172 --> 24:04.517
I'd expected an older person.

24:04.497 --> 24:11.476
What really surprised me as we continued to work together was his willingness and interest in sharing the material.

24:11.496 --> 24:12.860
And I think that is true.

24:13.882 --> 24:16.048
He is different there.

24:16.068 --> 24:20.059
I think with other collectors that I've since met through him or since meeting him,

24:21.035 --> 24:26.000
So many of them are not really willing to share their materials with scholars, with the general public.

24:26.020 --> 24:29.423
They're afraid that publishing a document will decrease its material value.

24:30.224 --> 24:33.046
They want to afford the materials.

24:33.327 --> 24:37.290
Part of the joy of collecting, I presume, is having something that nobody else has.

24:38.131 --> 24:42.576
And LD, I've observed him grow in that area.

24:42.596 --> 24:49.422
When I met him, he was a collector, primarily because he'd never given a lot of consideration to doing other things with the collection.

24:49.402 --> 24:54.428
But what's impressed me has been his willingness to grow and develop.

24:54.709 --> 25:05.862
And I've been not only impressed, I've been amazed at the extent to which he is willing to help scholars and share the material.

25:05.882 --> 25:16.075
Again, early on, I thought if we could just get one exhibit and one book, that might be the extent of what this university could achieve in that regard.

25:16.095 --> 25:18.598
And it's been largely his

25:18.578 --> 25:25.045
generosity and sharing that's made the other things happen.

25:25.065 --> 25:29.061
There's a, you know, the standard stereotype of a collector is just obsessed.

25:30.256 --> 25:37.205
passionate person who really is driven to acquire every pregnant item that he can.

25:38.226 --> 25:41.390
Do you see any of that in L.D.?

25:41.410 --> 25:43.313
Well, yes indeed.

25:43.333 --> 25:53.766
I think he is the obsessive in his drive to collect, but he's also obsessive in his desire to

25:53.746 --> 26:01.936
to go beyond the collecting to do some other positive things with the materials.

26:01.956 --> 26:06.581
Did you ever find any of us amusing, you know, Lord, what trolls these mortals?

26:06.601 --> 26:09.164
Well, I've benefited, there's no doubt.

26:09.484 --> 26:15.031
I'm more laid back, and I don't have the energy level.

26:15.051 --> 26:21.038
I have to back off and recoup and play golf.

26:21.058 --> 26:22.960
I'm amazed at this fellow's energy.

26:23.429 --> 26:34.654
had it been left to me we wouldn't have done eight books in ten years and I could not have done that and it took not only his assistance and working together on the project but

26:35.495 --> 26:56.143
There were times when he had to lean on me a little and push, and I'm the kind of person that needs that.

26:56.163 --> 26:56.403
I need what?

26:56.423 --> 26:58.266
I needed a coach when I was an athlete to push me a little bit.

26:58.286 --> 26:59.367
Otherwise, I'd get lazy and get complacent.

26:59.387 --> 27:00.108
The most remarkable thing about L.D.

27:00.128 --> 27:00.949
Brodsky is that he never gets complacent.

27:00.969 --> 27:01.270
He never tires.

27:01.290 --> 27:02.732
He has this remarkable energy level and this drive, and it is obsessive.

27:02.752 --> 27:03.713
It's also very magnificent because of the touch.

27:04.553 --> 27:06.556
It gives him something to look forward to the next day.

27:06.576 --> 27:09.962
He doesn't really believe in resting on his laws as a collector.

27:09.982 --> 27:22.101
And I think the opportunity to publish... When I met this guy, there was no way he could have written a full-length biography of William Faulkner.

27:22.422 --> 27:24.845
I mean, the book that Texas did.

27:24.865 --> 27:27.550
He could not have done that 10, 12 years ago.

27:27.570 --> 27:29.353
He couldn't even write a footnote.

27:29.373 --> 27:29.633
That's right.

27:29.832 --> 27:53.764
and so uh and the graduate school training that he had had been in other directions or it just uh but i mean we both learned from the experience and one thing that he learned is scholarship and how to write footnotes and how to go out and that's what made this whole thing work too i call it a kind of chemistry that was so positive

27:54.031 --> 27:57.676
If the chemistry hadn't been there, Bob and I would have recognized it early on.

27:57.696 --> 28:08.631
But when we started working together, we knew that we shared, that there was a kindredness to our sensibilities, that we had certainly shared an interest in Faulkner's literature.

28:08.672 --> 28:14.279
That was the prime sharing with which we both started, or the point from which we began.

28:14.319 --> 28:19.086
But what we found is that we really enjoyed working together and being together.

28:19.887 --> 28:23.312
And we found that, therefore, the work wasn't work at all.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.534
was a kind of special pleasure, and it remains that to this day.

28:27.395 --> 28:39.351
I will tell you this, not to be a mutual admiration society, but I chose, if you will, a collaborator, a partner, who is every bit my equal in energy and staying power.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.793
And I demand that.

28:41.574 --> 28:42.515
I am very strong.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.880
And people I demanded in an unspoken way.

28:46.361 --> 28:49.705
Had Bob not had all the strengths that he had,

28:50.005 --> 28:57.498
And certainly he had one wonderful thing that he brought to the equation, which was all of his academic background, his training.

28:58.419 --> 28:59.601
I did not have that training.

28:59.922 --> 29:03.768
My training had pretty well been artistic, if you will.

29:03.788 --> 29:07.795
I mentioned to you that they didn't ask me to return to do my PhD at Washington U.

29:07.775 --> 29:12.561
Basically, I didn't bring to that thesis the kind of academic skills they wanted.

29:12.581 --> 29:15.224
I did bring to it innovative ideas.

29:16.426 --> 29:32.365
And so what happened to make that chemistry work was that Bob and I together share, shared and do share to this day, such wonderfully compatible elements of what we do that are both disparate and yet they share.

29:32.446 --> 29:35.629
Rather, Faulkner wrote a dedication.

29:35.750 --> 29:36.310
I love that.

29:36.330 --> 29:37.792
I'll come back to it if I can quote it right.

29:38.473 --> 29:43.458
In Big Woods, he was thanking Saks Cummins, his editor, for at that point almost 20 years.

29:44.119 --> 29:50.045
And he said in his dedication to that book something to this effect, and we can corroborate it when we look it up.

29:53.229 --> 29:55.551
We may not have always seen eye to eye.

29:55.531 --> 30:17.320
but we have always been looking at the same thing. It is just so wonderful. He always had a way of saying it. He did and he said it almost like that, and I'd like to get it right. If you print it but I will tell you I feel that way with Bob. We're two individuals who have had found a sharing a compatibility that has been

30:17.519 --> 30:21.707
as I said, transcended to all the publishing we've done, to all the work.

30:22.147 --> 30:29.681
We're on something, we're on the brink together of something extremely exciting, and it would fulfill my greatest dream for this collection.

30:29.701 --> 30:31.765
And that is that it not only become a public

30:31.998 --> 30:37.122
repository, which it is, but that it have the proper housing.

30:37.142 --> 30:54.677
And though no one has heard of Southeast Missouri State in a national way, or not often, if we get in place what Bob and others here have initiated, which is a Center for Faulkner Studies, it will be on the map.

30:55.257 --> 30:56.178
And we're working toward that.

30:56.198 --> 30:59.081
And that's something I want Bob to describe to you in a little detail later.

30:59.101 --> 31:01.903
It's the epitome for me of what started out

31:02.170 --> 31:21.115
is that little book collection at Yale to bring it in a 30, 32 year period from that point to this point where we have an auditorium and classrooms and showrooms and money allocated for preservation and expansion of the collection as a government funded operation.

31:21.575 --> 31:27.503
It would be a phenomenal testimony to what's here.

31:27.854 --> 31:32.200
I hear some questions from Robert.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.983
I don't want to answer your question.

31:35.064 --> 31:36.846
Go ahead if you want to.

31:36.866 --> 31:37.447
No, I'm done now.

31:37.567 --> 31:38.188
Sorry to run in there.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.109
I eat and talk a lot.

31:39.129 --> 31:41.953
I'm always the last one finished because I talk so much.

31:42.734 --> 31:52.647
To go back to the word staggering, you know, collection, maybe you could pick up a little bit on that.

31:52.627 --> 31:56.872
As a scholar, does it have staggering context?

31:58.014 --> 32:08.046
Well, it did when I first saw it, and even more so now, because it's doubled in size and all the material that has been added.

32:08.066 --> 32:11.170
Just the 1940s movie scripts, for example.

32:11.270 --> 32:14.033
We brought those in about 84 or 85, didn't we?

32:14.053 --> 32:15.715
And nobody even, you know...

32:15.695 --> 32:17.618
These things just like came out of the woodwork.

32:17.638 --> 32:31.558
We had a great article in Love's Press, the French Weekly Magazine, that's the approval of Time, about the find of that Egal story and also about the fact that it's here at Southeast Missouri State.

32:31.578 --> 32:35.103
That was quite a nice article.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.428
Anybody for dessert?

32:38.965 --> 33:02.509
Not for me, thanks. When I came to southeast I left Mississippi. I left Ole Miss. I had finished my graduate work, my dissertation on Faulkner, and I thought I needed a break from Faulkner and I was always interested in Robert Frost and I checked all the Faulker books in the library back into the library. I finished my dissertation, I checked out 15 books on Robert Frost, and I started this article on a Frost poet

33:02.776 --> 33:07.284
and wrote the first paragraph or so, and then I met Ali.

33:09.608 --> 33:13.354
And that ended, I haven't done the article on Frost.

33:13.374 --> 33:22.430
He put me back into the partner, and so when he invited me to come up and see the collection for the first time, much of it then was stored at the Mercantile Bank in Farmington.

33:22.490 --> 33:25.155
We went down, he went back into the vault.

33:25.321 --> 33:27.966
They gave us a room to use there.

33:27.986 --> 33:39.846
He opened these safety deposit boxes and pulled out these manuscripts and the burn fragments, some of those, the books.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.152
I mean, I was blown away.

33:43.332 --> 33:49.523
I had done a master's thesis and a dissertation on Faulkner, but I had never seen the original manuscripts.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.541
I used paperback novels.

33:53.482 --> 33:58.987
In doing my research, I had no real... It wasn't the kind of research where I needed the original materials.

33:59.147 --> 34:02.310
I had never seen the original dust jackets on these novels.

34:02.371 --> 34:05.874
And that's what I meant when I said it was staggering.

34:05.894 --> 34:11.280
And University of Mississippi, when he was there, now that I'm putting this into perspective, had no manuscripts at that time at all.

34:11.900 --> 34:18.347
And had what they called the Mississippiana Collection, but had very few Faulkner books of any stature, but had no manuscripts.

34:18.367 --> 34:19.628
That wasn't until the 80s.

34:19.895 --> 34:21.925
that they acquired what manuscripts they had.

34:22.467 --> 34:27.913
And then to see it grow as it began to do

34:28.231 --> 34:44.179
I have said repeatedly that I blame Bob for this collection because when we would work, there was such gratification in our working together, in our collaborations.

34:44.199 --> 34:49.067
It inspired me to want to go out and find more materials so that we could do more work.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.433
And there was no greed and there was no sense of ego in it.

34:52.413 --> 34:57.940
It was this beautiful desire that Dee and I were creating something that was wonderful.

34:57.980 --> 35:01.123
And what it was, was a story about the collection itself.

35:01.384 --> 35:02.285
It isn't done yet.

35:03.046 --> 35:05.408
Dee and I will finish the story.

35:05.569 --> 35:08.372
It's six books to go before the story is concluded.

35:08.572 --> 35:13.178
Are there any, you basically, you're a young man.

35:14.399 --> 35:22.048
I mean, if you chose to continue collecting, you know, you've got 20, 30 years of productive collecting left.

35:22.248 --> 35:23.209
if you so chose.

35:24.311 --> 35:27.655
But do you basically see this as a complete collection?

35:29.017 --> 35:35.104
Is there a treasure trove out there that would prompt you to drop everything?

35:35.225 --> 35:37.928
I recently acquired eight letters from the Faulkner family.

35:39.110 --> 35:42.153
Recently being like... Recently, within the last three months.

35:42.954 --> 35:45.758
I am not working at acquiring with the avidity

35:46.008 --> 35:50.913
that I had before because of the nature of where the collection is located right now.

35:50.973 --> 35:52.395
It's owned by the state of Missouri.

35:53.236 --> 35:59.722
I don't have funds available to me directly at this point to acquire more.

36:00.483 --> 36:07.370
I am at perfect liberty to sell off anything I want in the collection and replace it with anything I wish to purchase with the money that I get from selling.

36:07.611 --> 36:10.293
That's part of my agreement with this university.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.817
My curatorial powers are all inclusive.

36:15.018 --> 36:15.559
I may...

36:15.539 --> 36:31.671
Deacquisition and acquisition anything that I choose for the 20 years and when I forego my position, my successor will not have any power whatsoever to deacquisition even the slightest item.

36:31.691 --> 36:32.873
You have the authority.

36:33.427 --> 36:36.651
Let's clarify this, okay?

36:36.671 --> 36:45.641
You have the authority to add or subtract anything from the collection that you feel is appropriate or necessary.

36:45.701 --> 36:47.162
Well, on behalf of the university.

36:47.182 --> 36:52.829
But nevertheless, he doesn't have to run it by the Board of Regents or the President or anybody else.

36:52.849 --> 36:54.210
I'm not sure about that.

36:54.511 --> 36:58.735
Theoretically, I am supposed to let the President know what my intentions are.

36:58.856 --> 37:00.177
But that would be a tacit.

37:00.157 --> 37:02.841
kind of a thing, and I will do that.

37:02.881 --> 37:05.364
Have you added, or have you added?

37:05.404 --> 37:09.029
I have added, and I'm at the point where I may have to deacquisition some items.

37:09.390 --> 37:11.012
We've traded a couple of them.

37:11.032 --> 37:12.113
We've traded some already.

37:12.794 --> 37:16.660
See, again, as you build a manuscript collection, you might trade off a few books.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.342
Well, that's what I intend to do right now.

37:18.402 --> 37:25.692
What I've been adding... We need to develop the scholarly aspect of the collection, and so if there are 200 books inscribed at Faulkner,

37:26.262 --> 37:31.767
Theoretically, you could sell off five or ten books, raise money to buy manuscripts, letters, whatever.

37:31.867 --> 37:35.130
And the university has, in a sense, L.D.

37:35.150 --> 37:36.871
is now an employee of the institution.

37:36.891 --> 37:38.973
He's on the staff here, just as I am.

37:38.993 --> 37:41.716
And he works as curator of this collection.

37:41.816 --> 37:46.460
It's his responsibility in that position to continue to build the collection.

37:46.520 --> 37:55.948
Now, until we acquire enough funding and get a budget for the center and so on that would enable us to do this with university funds,

37:56.131 --> 38:01.219
Initially, we have to trade.

38:02.221 --> 38:07.429
Presently, there's no money in the budget for the acquisition of new materials.

38:07.449 --> 38:09.953
Since materials may come on the market that L.D.

38:09.973 --> 38:20.170
is interested in for the collection, he's worked out this very imaginative and creative way of financing those until the university puts the center in place and has funding.

38:20.450 --> 38:23.455
None of us wants to sell off any books to buy letters.

38:24.143 --> 38:28.168
But over the next year or two, that's the only way we could acquire manuscript material.

38:28.188 --> 38:29.990
LD has the authority to do that.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.193
And I'm probably going to begin doing that now.

38:32.513 --> 38:44.848
And since he's the collector, and I'm the director of the Faulkner Center, but my role is scholarly, and he's still the collector, and I would not have the qualifications or knowledge or ability to do that.

38:44.888 --> 38:50.775
So the deal that the university cut with Brodsky, we not only got a Faulkner collection,

38:51.059 --> 38:56.066
In fact, Stacy told me early on, we're not interested in just getting the collection, we want the collector.

38:56.087 --> 38:57.328
We want his services.

38:57.348 --> 39:03.898
We want his experience and expertise working for this institution.

39:03.918 --> 39:08.144
And so what we're in now is a transition period until we're truly established as a partner center.

39:08.165 --> 39:14.334
We have to look for some rather creative ways to generate revenue to enable LD to acquire letters and manuscripts.

39:14.354 --> 39:19.902
So you still are able to... You are still able to...

39:20.438 --> 39:40.219
is satisfied by the collecting kick. That was so you know where I'm coming from. I would like to believe that truly I have the best of all the worlds. I retained them for myself. I created this so that I could still as it were play the game, and I don't mind in quotes working for

39:40.199 --> 39:46.308
the university because in essence I always felt I was working for all of us in creating the collection.

39:47.069 --> 39:54.139
I told you it was never done for monetary reasons and it wasn't done because I wanted to become some great collectorly celebrity.

39:54.519 --> 39:57.243
He even gets fringe benefits in medical plans.

39:58.625 --> 40:04.093
But I enjoy and I feel good about being a part of this university.

40:04.113 --> 40:08.599
It makes me feel good to think I'm on the staff of this university.

40:08.679 --> 40:09.801
It's a role but

40:10.220 --> 40:16.326
I always felt I was a curator, in the best sense of the word, when I was putting together this collection of Faulkner material.

40:16.826 --> 40:18.648
I was curating for all of us.

40:19.409 --> 40:26.775
Did you make this, did you make this, and I hesitate to use the word demand, but did you make this a requirement?

40:26.956 --> 40:27.516
Yes, I did.

40:27.596 --> 40:28.877
I made up many requirements.

40:29.178 --> 40:30.379
I mean, this particular one.

40:30.619 --> 40:30.799
Yes.

40:30.979 --> 40:32.941
That you retain this authority.

40:33.402 --> 40:33.542
Indeed.

40:33.562 --> 40:37.225
Was this something that you insisted when you were talking with Gail and Mississippi and the others?

40:37.826 --> 40:39.147
I was getting to that, yes.

40:39.734 --> 40:43.841
Yes, and they had a real problem with that because they felt I was stepping on their toes.

40:43.901 --> 40:49.070
I never got to Yale with that because they were so haughty that they didn't allow me to get that far into their inner sanctum.

40:49.090 --> 40:50.512
But that's something that you would have required.

40:50.552 --> 40:51.214
Absolutely.

40:51.254 --> 40:56.382
And at Ole Miss, I did cover a lot of that ground, and they weren't exactly amenable.

40:57.264 --> 41:02.012
The money portion of it, they could work out, and they also found it not...

41:02.245 --> 41:10.599
When I suggested that they could help themselves monetarily by making me part of their staff, they had a real problem with that, which is their loss.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.843
This is not unprecedented, of course.

41:12.863 --> 41:18.553
I mean, Carlton Lake is the executive curator at the University of Texas, Harry Ransom.

41:18.573 --> 41:20.035
I mean, he came with his...

41:20.015 --> 41:45.634
he came with his... Well I don't think it's unprecedented either and i think it's... And of course what they what do they get, as point out, they don't just get the collection. You've got that, you've got the engine that moves this. Well and the engine... This whole thing together and has the expert knows how to get things and add things and certainly has a taste in connoisseurship because that's already been demonstrated you know. Well you asked me am I still a collector? Am I still interested in collecting? And the answer on both

41:45.614 --> 41:47.176
to both of those is, yes, I am.

41:47.736 --> 41:50.259
But you're now collecting for the university.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.782
I am, and I'm doing it with a different approach, too.

41:53.363 --> 41:56.867
I'm not quite as aggressive with it at this point because I'm trying to back myself off.

41:57.488 --> 42:02.594
There were a number of items in the Peterson Faulkner collection that I would have liked to have had.

42:03.475 --> 42:04.957
Bob and I worked through our collection.

42:04.977 --> 42:14.608
They would have enhanced a number of our shortcomings, areas where we're lacking reprints or second printings or what have you.

42:14.825 --> 42:21.539
We didn't go in for any of that because I decided to divert that money instead into manuscript materials.

42:21.579 --> 42:27.231
The one book I bought that I told you out of the collection, the only piece, that cost me $23,000.

42:28.004 --> 42:54.433
That piece had an inscribed poem I told you of James Joyce. What it was was Faulkner one night talking with his friend Tony Butita down in North Carolina getting drunk. Faulkner we all know loved poetry and loved to quote poetry and was legion at misquoting poetry. So he and Tony were trying to quote this poem, which he loved by the way, he read it verbatim. He used to read the needle bolts at san sabato verbatim, his mistress out in california

42:54.616 --> 42:58.716
They were trying to get it right, and they were both drunk, and they were both getting it wrong.

42:58.756 --> 43:02.153
So Faulkner finally said, OK, Tony, goddammit, I'm going to write it in the book.

43:02.173 --> 43:03.158
Here's how it is.

43:03.425 --> 43:09.132
So we'll show him that book today, but it says, for Tony, this is how it is, or something like that.

43:09.232 --> 43:13.958
And then he misquotes, proceeds to misquote this wonderful Joyce poem.

43:13.978 --> 43:15.961
And I think it's a manuscript.

43:16.001 --> 43:22.109
The point is, that I was trying to make, I bought one piece out of the Peterson collection, and it was not a book, really.

43:22.549 --> 43:25.093
It wasn't really a presentation copy to Tony Boutita.

43:25.553 --> 43:28.317
It is, in fact, a manuscript, if you will.

43:28.337 --> 43:30.900
And it's a wonderful artifact.

43:30.880 --> 43:52.826
I am collecting, I still have the enthusiasm, but I'm doing it in a different way now because I am, as it were, beholden to the collection now, to the university, and though I have always had a fit with bureaucracy, well, I'll tell you what, the agreement I made with the university pretty well allows me to skirt its day-to-day bureaucracy.

43:52.946 --> 43:58.272
And short of that, I would not have made a deal with this university or any other one because for me to have to follow

43:58.252 --> 44:07.926
academic bureaucracy to the letter, which is fine, that's the way you run a government organization, would have been to never put a book collection together.

44:07.946 --> 44:09.628
Because you jump at things when they're there.

44:10.670 --> 44:16.358
If you have to take four to six months to get a board's approval or someone else's approval to acquire something, you're dead, it's gone.

44:18.261 --> 44:19.683
And so that's workable too.

44:19.703 --> 44:23.128
But yes, there are a lot of contingent agreements

44:23.851 --> 44:36.366
in this wonderful creative contract that Bill Stacy was farsighted enough to not only find acceptable, but agreeable, because he wanted me to expand the collection.

44:36.386 --> 44:42.032
And he knew that it was only on those terms that I could feel comfortable and free.

44:42.553 --> 44:45.016
I work for the university, and yet I'm very free.

44:45.776 --> 44:48.880
And the university appreciates that, and I think has great respect for me.

44:49.197 --> 45:01.688
I think that one reason that the university could enter this kind of agreement with Eldie was because he'd worked with the university for 10 years.

45:02.489 --> 45:10.176
And in looking back and seeing how this all unfolded, I think it did wind up that we had the inside track.

45:10.196 --> 45:16.321
I mean, we didn't know what we had the inside track for, and we weren't out there trying to acquire the collection.

45:16.441 --> 45:18.563
It hadn't even dawned on us that we might be able to do that.

45:18.543 --> 45:23.332
But when he talked to Yale or Ole Miss, they hadn't been working with him for 10 years.

45:23.753 --> 45:29.944
And understandably, they may have been a little nervous about bringing the collector on board with the collection to be involved.

45:30.946 --> 45:35.996
You see, whereas we had no reservations about that sort of thing because we'd already been working with him for 10 years.

45:36.016 --> 45:38.019
And the collaboration had gone very well.

45:38.240 --> 45:42.087
He was very, he was obviously interested in the welfare of the institution.

45:42.488 --> 45:44.893
And we had had success with the collection.

45:45.094 --> 45:56.719
Dean Goodwin, President Stacey, Chairman of the English Department, Henry Sussoms, the librarian, Jim Zink, I, all of us have been able to work with L.D.

45:58.884 --> 45:59.485
very well.

45:59.802 --> 46:01.725
You said there was a man named Roger Peterson.

46:01.745 --> 46:08.036
In the early 80s, a man who I believe was named Roger Peterson, but it was Peterson and we could find that out easily from Yale.

46:08.216 --> 46:08.657
From Yale.

46:08.697 --> 46:18.214
Who was the acting librarian on my invitation and on his pursuing it, came down and visited with me at Farmington, at my home in Farmington in the early 80s.

46:19.075 --> 46:20.157
And we talked about...

46:20.322 --> 46:23.045
the possibility of the Beinecke getting it.

46:23.325 --> 46:24.186
He pursued it.

46:24.487 --> 46:25.628
He initiated it.

46:26.289 --> 46:27.089
I didn't call him.

46:27.130 --> 46:30.353
He had called me, is the way I want to get that on the record.

46:30.373 --> 46:31.514
I may have said it wrong initially.

46:32.115 --> 46:34.017
I was very excited.

46:34.097 --> 46:34.778
I talked with him.

46:34.998 --> 46:35.879
That was early on.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.203
I hadn't formulated it.

46:40.504 --> 46:50.295
I had not formulated all of the requirements that would be necessary to satisfy me psychologically, emotionally, if I were going to disburden myself for this collection.

46:51.203 --> 46:53.587
But I had enough of them in place so that we talked.

46:54.008 --> 47:01.279
And I remember one of the discussions we had, though I hate to go on record with this, was that my two children would be allowed to go to Yale free.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.005
That that would be one of the requirements that they would have no problem with.

47:05.065 --> 47:06.748
I don't want to go on record with them.

47:07.032 --> 47:17.344
So I had in my mind even then the necessity of requiring certain things if I were going to do this.

47:17.384 --> 47:21.289
He was real excited about acquiring this collection and we went into negotiations.

47:21.329 --> 47:22.530
He was soon replaced.

47:23.992 --> 47:32.702
And that was sad because his successor, maybe a man named Franklin, who is still there, he didn't pursue me, so I pursued him.

47:33.273 --> 47:41.550
He made a limp invitation for me to come up and I may have visited with his assistant because he was not there the day that they invited me to come up.

47:43.093 --> 47:47.282
And I met with his assistant who was a rather arrogant young man.

47:47.768 --> 47:51.615
who knew so much that it was obvious I didn't know anything.

47:51.936 --> 47:55.603
And I was really put off that day in New Haven, and I left there very disillusioned.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.025
And I thought, well, fuck them, too.

47:57.226 --> 47:59.109
I don't lose any of those fuck yous in this army.

48:01.494 --> 48:03.598
This isn't the Bobby Knight movie.

48:03.618 --> 48:04.259
No, it's not.

48:04.459 --> 48:06.503
You know, I haven't even mentioned that, but...

48:06.483 --> 48:13.863
I do want my typist to put them down and we'll deal with them later.

48:13.883 --> 48:16.089
But it really was disillusioned.

48:16.109 --> 48:21.825
And then the second time I went to Yale.

48:22.312 --> 48:30.146
This guy, in a week's time, had an option to close the deal, a check, I mean, he jumped on me.

48:30.166 --> 48:39.342
So Stacy is telling me, sent Meldy a check for about a thousand or two thousand dollars, something like that.

48:39.362 --> 48:40.624
But what it was, was...

48:41.431 --> 48:42.433
It was an option.

48:42.573 --> 48:43.094
90 days.

48:43.114 --> 48:44.376
It was a 90 day option.

48:45.778 --> 48:48.643
And in that time they would see if they could close a deal.

48:48.663 --> 48:54.492
And I was very excited to receive the check because it said that they were as... How quickly did you receive it?

48:54.532 --> 48:55.393
Like a week?

48:55.614 --> 48:56.014
A week.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.036
Within a week of the check?

48:57.056 --> 48:58.258
A week after the conversation.

48:58.829 --> 49:23.166
well he was smart. He said. Well I told you that he had a background that wasn't in administration so much as it was in though he was a good administrator, but it was in English and public speaking. For two years. Yes yes one of the things. They never really got down to anything serious. And get down because I think they also maybe wanted

49:23.770 --> 49:42.353
to give it to them you know. Well no they were willing I told you, and they would have gone higher monetarily. Our initial talks set it up so that porter fortune had no problem with cutting me a million dollar check for that collection which was very nominal, even then when I talked with him. And I threw that out as a starting point but

49:43.126 --> 49:50.235
What I had here at Southeast Missouri State, I also realized I wasn't going to have at Washington U and Yale for various reasons.

49:50.315 --> 49:52.438
I couldn't work at Yale and be a curator there all the time.

49:52.879 --> 49:55.602
I wanted still to be part of this collection.

49:56.984 --> 50:01.310
So what I was able to do was both give it to the world and yet retain it.

50:02.211 --> 50:04.554
Now that is a real difficult trick.

50:04.574 --> 50:07.959
Bill Stacey appreciated that in all its nuances.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.602
The agreement that I created

50:10.818 --> 50:19.287
He accepted point by point by point with virtually no modifications except the few that he needed to make in terms of his creative financing.

50:20.468 --> 50:29.117
But he applauded my desire to want to retain, as it were, control, not nominal, but control of the collection.

50:29.137 --> 50:38.226
When I give up my tenure, people will be able to add to this collection, but not

50:38.712 --> 50:46.940
dismantle it so that I have a hand for the next 18 years now of the 20-year contract that's running in continuing to shape it.

50:47.581 --> 50:48.802
Now that pleasures me a lot.

50:49.863 --> 50:51.926
I have many other options that came with that.

50:52.306 --> 50:54.748
Do you have an option to renew Office 20?

50:54.989 --> 50:57.591
I have an option to be continued.

50:59.233 --> 51:00.855
Not with this partner.

51:00.915 --> 51:06.120
I've got to write that Frost article.

51:06.472 --> 51:08.174
We're now in the Rare Book Room.

51:08.194 --> 51:09.695
Is that the formal name of this?

51:09.735 --> 51:11.857
This is the Rare Book Room.

51:11.917 --> 51:12.758
The Kent Library.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.618
The Kent Library.

51:13.658 --> 51:18.102
You said this collection also has... It has the most formidable collection of photographs.

51:19.123 --> 51:20.444
I'm going to run an error.

51:20.464 --> 51:20.725
Okay.

51:20.865 --> 51:21.625
All right.

51:22.486 --> 51:24.928
Inscribed Faulkner photos are real hard to find.

51:24.948 --> 51:27.491
This collection has eight inscribed Faulkner photos.

51:27.931 --> 51:32.655
I mentioned to you in our earlier discussion about the Salma Gundi and the rarity of those.

51:33.256 --> 51:35.938
This one is a real gem, if I can pull the right one out.

51:36.458 --> 51:45.488
Let's just talk about, this may not be the best example, but let's talk about variation.

51:46.329 --> 51:50.754
You can see in this, on all these shelves, so many titles that look alike, identical.

51:51.315 --> 51:54.819
And I suggested to you that we don't have duplications in this collection.

51:55.059 --> 51:57.582
But I see three Dr. Martinos.

51:57.722 --> 51:59.985
Okay, let's... You don't see three, you see about 15.

52:00.607 --> 52:02.831
And I'm going to suggest that each of those is different.

52:02.851 --> 52:03.452
Okay.

52:03.472 --> 52:16.072
And they may be different in that one belonged to Saks Cummins and one to Phil Stone and has his signature in it, or it may have the bookplate of William Alexander Percy, or five of those may have inscriptions from Faulkner to various people, such as his daughter Chocho.

52:16.413 --> 52:17.615
So they have unique aspects.

52:17.715 --> 52:20.039
Unique aspects to the same appearing book.

52:20.319 --> 52:20.540
Right.

52:20.900 --> 52:24.646
Let me just show you this as an example, and then I'll show you some more nice things.

52:24.907 --> 52:25.969
Do you want to see nice books?

52:26.770 --> 52:26.850
Yes.

52:27.269 --> 52:30.214
I'm going to show you nice books.

52:30.354 --> 52:39.869
I'm going to show you books that if I had to bring them out in Glenn Horowitz's bookshop, you'd have said I made a bad deal getting rid of these books because I know they're very valuable.

52:40.110 --> 52:42.233
I really haven't followed the book stock market.

52:42.273 --> 52:43.155
May I just hold one?

52:43.175 --> 52:43.816
Sure.

52:43.836 --> 52:48.764
This book is the only known inscribed copy of Salma Gundi.

52:48.864 --> 52:50.667
It's a presentation copy to Hubert Starr.

52:50.807 --> 52:54.593
Hubert, H-U-B-E-R-T-S-T-A-R-R.

52:55.197 --> 52:56.238
From William Faulkner.

52:56.819 --> 52:57.360
What's this here?

52:58.261 --> 53:00.764
Santa Monica, 23 July 1934.

53:00.804 --> 53:02.746
These are during the movie days, right?

53:02.766 --> 53:05.249
Yes, this was in his first trips, his first few trips to the movies.

53:05.269 --> 53:06.791
The condition is rather wonderful, isn't it?

53:06.831 --> 53:07.212
Beautiful.

53:07.252 --> 53:12.678
Well, Hubert knew that Faulkner was going to be famous, and he put these books away.

53:13.119 --> 53:16.543
And that's Salma Gundi, S-A-L-M-A-G-U-N-D-I.

53:17.364 --> 53:19.206
Now, hold on.

53:19.226 --> 53:21.950
We're just going to give you a real array of just gems.

53:22.010 --> 53:24.613
I'll just go through it because I know you appreciate fine books.

53:24.948 --> 53:27.772
We're talking about rare Faulkner books, ones of a kind.

53:29.695 --> 53:33.841
I have not at this point, and we'll begin, putting all the books in glassine.

53:34.361 --> 53:37.586
I haven't ever spent the money having nice fancy boxes.

53:37.646 --> 53:39.369
Well, you're going to start acting like a curator.

53:39.409 --> 53:42.173
Well, I'll start, is right, because these books are so profound.

53:42.934 --> 53:45.237
You're going to wear your curatorial hat.

53:45.257 --> 53:47.080
Well, I guess I am to a certain extent.

53:47.440 --> 53:50.905
But I always felt it was more important to spend the money on the books.

53:51.273 --> 53:57.859
Now, I really ought to take another example on this to see what this might just be a straight copy of that.

53:58.299 --> 53:59.140
Let's sound with Indy.

53:59.200 --> 53:59.460
Yeah.

53:59.980 --> 54:05.965
But there are five different variations here, and that may be your normal one.

54:07.226 --> 54:10.129
I don't even want to go through all this, really.

54:10.149 --> 54:11.310
I don't think it's necessary.

54:11.330 --> 54:11.690
It isn't.

54:12.170 --> 54:14.532
Now I got myself curious, but we've got time.

54:14.572 --> 54:15.193
You don't have to.

54:15.213 --> 54:17.575
You're running all that.

54:17.595 --> 54:21.178
I don't know what's... One of this may have been trim top

54:21.445 --> 54:23.188
This was the one that's the oddball trimming.

54:24.049 --> 54:26.513
Anyway, let me show you.

54:26.533 --> 54:27.955
I showed you the one that was the inscribed.

54:27.975 --> 54:28.956
That's the most significant.

54:28.976 --> 54:30.939
I think one of these had a William Alexander Percy.

54:31.921 --> 54:32.221
There it is.

54:32.281 --> 54:33.143
Which I like a lot.

54:33.163 --> 54:34.324
I think that's real significant.

54:34.344 --> 54:35.486
A Mississippian, a poet.

54:36.027 --> 54:37.810
He wrote Lanterns on the Levee.

54:37.870 --> 54:39.412
Not a book of poems.

54:39.432 --> 54:41.335
But Faulkner knew him and had respect for him.

54:41.355 --> 54:42.897
So I think that's an exciting book.

54:42.917 --> 54:45.521
Why did Hemingway write that little poem on the back of Selma Goodney?

54:45.541 --> 54:47.825
Or why did they compile it?

54:47.845 --> 54:48.145
Well...

54:48.800 --> 54:55.487
Ultimately, Ernest Hemingway, and it's a four-line poem, dated June 1922.

54:55.687 --> 54:59.511
I think the fact that they were put together was just sort of a real anomaly.

55:00.112 --> 55:01.133
It's great for collectors.

55:01.213 --> 55:02.234
Yeah, it's great for collectors.

55:03.815 --> 55:08.901
What makes this one nice is that it had the prospectus in it, and it gives you some of the data that nothing else would have given you.

55:09.301 --> 55:09.962
Not a bad price.

55:10.102 --> 55:11.283
Well, that was a long time ago.

55:11.303 --> 55:12.084
$500?

55:12.665 --> 55:13.385
Long time ago.

55:13.786 --> 55:16.909
That book today... Is that what you paid?

55:17.509 --> 55:18.030
Probably.

55:18.415 --> 55:19.977
Do you ever try and work them down?

55:20.758 --> 55:21.679
I do.

55:21.699 --> 55:23.381
Oh, sure.

55:23.401 --> 55:25.344
Let me show you something wonderful in here.

55:25.404 --> 55:28.027
Well, actually, it just depends.

55:28.047 --> 55:30.671
That looks like a Rockwell Kent book plate.

55:30.691 --> 55:32.032
It sure does, and it probably is.

55:32.373 --> 55:33.374
This one was a normal one.

55:33.394 --> 55:34.075
I mean, the book plate does.

55:34.095 --> 55:35.256
Yeah, yeah.

55:35.276 --> 55:38.360
This was the normal copy, I guess.

55:38.380 --> 55:38.841
Uncut?

55:40.022 --> 55:41.284
No, not completely uncut.

55:42.327 --> 55:47.427
That's Miss Zilphia Gant, G-A-N-T.

55:47.447 --> 55:49.154
What I'm real proud of, that's a normal copy.

55:49.174 --> 55:51.142
This is a copy with the original glass scene.

55:51.182 --> 55:52.447
Again, the book is hard to find.

55:52.508 --> 55:53.130
It was limited.

55:53.296 --> 55:54.578
It was not signed, but limited.

55:54.618 --> 55:55.699
That's copy number 60.

55:55.739 --> 55:58.703
So these are just two copies of that that aren't particularly unique.

55:58.723 --> 56:00.265
What is the significance of this book?

56:00.706 --> 56:05.812
It was a short story, and it came out from the book club of Dallas in 1932, and it was limited.

56:05.852 --> 56:06.533
That's a tough mama.

56:06.693 --> 56:08.195
Oh, it's a real tough mama.

56:08.215 --> 56:09.597
It was tough even when I started.

56:09.617 --> 56:11.079
I'm going to show you something that blows my mind.

56:11.099 --> 56:14.764
There are four of these in the collection, and they are Faulkner's own.

56:14.744 --> 56:17.808
copy that he kept in his own library and signed.

56:17.848 --> 56:18.468
This is it here?

56:18.549 --> 56:20.491
This was his own copy of this book.

56:20.511 --> 56:23.274
This is inscribed William Faulkner, Oxford, Mississippi.

56:23.815 --> 56:24.315
Rowanoak.

56:24.616 --> 56:24.976
Rowanoak.

56:25.196 --> 56:28.681
R-O-W-A-N-O-A-K.

56:28.821 --> 56:29.161
One word.

56:29.341 --> 56:29.802
Rowanoak.

56:29.822 --> 56:30.243
Which is?

56:30.663 --> 56:31.244
His home.

56:31.264 --> 56:31.524
His home.

56:31.544 --> 56:32.285
The name of his home.

56:32.505 --> 56:33.667
27 August, 1932.

56:33.707 --> 56:35.088
That's his own copy.

56:36.350 --> 56:41.436
There is nothing more significant to me than this kind of a collectorly item for book collecting.

56:42.197 --> 56:43.138
This is the epitope.

56:43.158 --> 56:44.059
I just want to get my own book.

56:44.410 --> 56:45.932
I'm going to show you four of these.

56:46.052 --> 56:48.355
I'm going to show you some other books that came out of his library.

56:48.375 --> 56:49.617
I'm going to tell you a couple stories.

56:50.638 --> 56:54.623
This one and three others came out of the mother's home in Oxford.

56:54.683 --> 56:55.785
These belong to William.

56:56.165 --> 56:58.048
William stored them at his mother's home.

56:58.068 --> 56:59.169
I got them from the family.

57:00.771 --> 57:01.472
Good, I'm listening.

57:02.133 --> 57:09.122
I'm going to show you a copy of The Unvanquished now that is a little different than that.

57:11.546 --> 57:11.886
If I...

57:12.676 --> 57:16.882
See, Faulkner knew enough to keep the original glassine on, too, didn't he?

57:16.902 --> 57:18.885
No, that one's not the original glassine, sorry.

57:19.926 --> 57:21.208
Uh, no, not, he didn't.

57:23.150 --> 57:28.137
He didn't know that much.

57:28.157 --> 57:29.579
I'll just shut this off for a second.

57:30.200 --> 57:30.581
Example.

57:30.601 --> 57:31.722
We're gonna have some fun now, right?

57:32.163 --> 57:35.848
I'm gonna take, uh, two, four, five, six, seven,

57:36.132 --> 57:36.472
How many?

57:36.532 --> 57:39.276
Three, five, seven, eight copies of The Unvanquished.

57:39.436 --> 57:40.958
Some with dust jackets, some without.

57:41.318 --> 57:45.203
Oh, LD, why would you collect an Unvanquished without a dust jacket?

57:45.223 --> 57:48.407
Well, Nick, because this one was A.I.

57:48.807 --> 57:50.089
Buzzerides' copy.

57:50.109 --> 57:52.632
Faulkner lived with Buzzerides for two years out in California.

57:52.652 --> 57:53.713
Well, that's where you found this.

57:53.733 --> 57:56.457
Oh, so why would you collect one that had a slight water stain on the cover?

57:56.517 --> 58:02.424
Well, because, book dealer, it belonged to one of Faulkner's real good friends, Buzzerides.

58:03.004 --> 58:05.127
Oh, and why would you have this one with no dust jacket?

58:05.461 --> 58:07.183
Well, this one says the Tootsie.

58:07.203 --> 58:08.225
T-O-O-T-S-I-E.

58:08.405 --> 58:10.688
Merry Christmas 1938 Chocho.

58:10.808 --> 58:12.431
Well, that's not Faulkner's hand.

58:12.551 --> 58:13.732
C-H-C-H-O-C-H-O.

58:14.033 --> 58:15.174
That's not Faulkner's hand.

58:15.515 --> 58:16.616
You're right, Nick, that's not.

58:17.237 --> 58:21.343
That's Faulkner's stepdaughter's hand, Chocho Victoria Fielden.

58:21.543 --> 58:22.404
That's her handwriting.

58:23.706 --> 58:28.092
And she apparently gave that book to her friend Tootsie for Merry Christmas 1938.

58:29.274 --> 58:32.278
Okay, but here's something that's a little more interesting.

58:33.777 --> 58:36.701
For Tootsie Brown on the title page in William Faulkner's hand.

58:37.362 --> 58:38.364
Rowan Oak.

58:38.384 --> 58:39.806
20 Rowan Oak, 1938.

58:39.966 --> 58:40.947
Two words there.

58:41.528 --> 58:42.990
Did he change the spelling of his house?

58:43.110 --> 58:44.472
He did in that case, didn't he?

58:44.492 --> 58:45.153
Very interesting.

58:45.213 --> 58:46.896
Now, what's the story behind this one?

58:46.916 --> 58:54.827
Is it possible that Tootsie was a good friend of his stepdaughter, Chocho, and that she came to spend Christmas with the Faulkners that Christmas in 1938?

58:55.148 --> 59:01.777
And that Chocho, Victoria, happened to give her friend a gift, which was her copy of The Unvanquished?

59:02.238 --> 59:03.700
And is it possible she said...

59:04.000 --> 59:07.506
Billy, would you mind inscribing this for my friend Tootsie?

59:09.029 --> 59:09.911
And of course he did.

59:09.931 --> 59:15.942
And wouldn't it be nice if I could have known Tootsie Brown myself and have gotten the book from her?

59:16.362 --> 59:21.993
And I've had all the story about that and interviewed her and learned all about Rowanoak in 1938, which is all of what I did.

59:22.033 --> 59:24.557
So the book is a wonderful book.

59:24.577 --> 59:26.160
It's probably a $20,000 book.

59:26.512 --> 59:27.873
The book to me has no value.

59:28.194 --> 59:30.256
It has all value, and the value is all personal.

59:30.336 --> 59:31.117
I couldn't give a hoot.

59:31.177 --> 59:32.818
It's kind of like a Rosetta Stone, isn't it?

59:32.839 --> 59:33.359
Yeah, it is.

59:33.459 --> 59:34.080
It's wonderful.

59:34.480 --> 59:35.201
Okay.

59:35.221 --> 59:35.762
Do you like that?

59:36.082 --> 59:37.283
Yeah, I like that.

59:37.303 --> 59:37.784
You can have it.

59:38.204 --> 59:38.945
I like it a lot.

59:38.965 --> 59:40.687
I like it very much.

59:41.047 --> 59:41.628
What have I got here?

59:41.748 --> 59:45.972
Why do I have one here that, again, doesn't have a dust jacket and doesn't look like it has anything that distinguishes it?

59:45.992 --> 59:48.435
The only answer is I probably don't know.

59:48.455 --> 59:49.896
Oh, yes, I know.

59:49.916 --> 59:50.477
I do know.

59:50.997 --> 59:53.700
It's a second printing, and I probably had no second printings.

59:55.452 --> 59:56.796
And so that's why that one's there.

59:56.816 --> 59:57.478
It's not a first edition.

59:57.498 --> 59:58.461
Why would you want a second printing?

59:58.481 --> 01:00:00.928
Well, because I want different printings, especially early on.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.298
If you have a dust jacket, quite often it'll tell you a lot of history.

01:00:04.632 --> 01:00:07.316
That, I think, is white dust jackets.

01:00:07.716 --> 01:00:08.237
Oh, yeah.

01:00:08.357 --> 01:00:10.840
And for the ephemeral material that you get.

01:00:11.381 --> 01:00:12.783
Oh, so important.

01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:14.866
This book could have come out a month or so after that.

01:00:14.966 --> 01:00:15.307
Who knows?

01:00:15.347 --> 01:00:16.288
It could have come out two years.

01:00:16.648 --> 01:00:18.391
I really don't know if we know yet.

01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:23.778
There are some blurbs written by very famous people that are to be found no place else.

01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:24.479
Not blurbs.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:25.681
I'm talking about testimonials.

01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:28.224
So far, I've showed you four copies with no dust jacket.

01:00:28.264 --> 01:00:30.147
A collector would say, I won't buy them.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:30.948
Three copies.

01:00:31.008 --> 01:00:31.669
Fourth coming up.

01:00:31.769 --> 01:00:32.530
I wouldn't buy them.

01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:34.734
A copy without a dust jacket?

01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:37.257
Well, Nick, would you buy the inscribed Faulkner?

01:00:37.598 --> 01:00:38.859
Oh, yeah, I'd think about that.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.642
It'd sure be better with a dust jacket.

01:00:41.102 --> 01:00:41.683
Stupid.

01:00:42.785 --> 01:00:43.486
Here's another one.

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:44.327
No dust jacket.

01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:45.949
Oh, but this is Maude Morrow Brown.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:49.273
Who is she, 1938, the year that the book was published?

01:00:49.293 --> 01:00:51.576
Well, she was Calvin Brown's wife.

01:00:52.898 --> 01:00:59.087
And she was the mother of the daughter to whom Faulkner inscribed and wrote The Wishing Tree.

01:00:59.627 --> 01:01:01.870
For whom?

01:01:02.311 --> 01:01:03.192
Eleven years earlier.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.108
Well, she's really important because she's also... Where'd you find these, LD?

01:01:08.509 --> 01:01:09.571
Any of these from jailers?

01:01:09.772 --> 01:01:09.932
No.

01:01:09.992 --> 01:01:11.375
Is this field work?

01:01:11.395 --> 01:01:13.019
All field work.

01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:13.560
All field work.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.562
From the Brown family.

01:01:15.244 --> 01:01:17.027
From Calvin Brown, the wonderful teacher.

01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:19.172
The son of Mark.
