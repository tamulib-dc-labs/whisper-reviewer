WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:10.015
We're talking to Betsy Shirley in Reynoldsville, New Jersey.

00:10.035 --> 00:11.116
But don't put that in.

00:11.156 --> 00:14.220
No, no, let me, that's just for the sake of identification.

00:14.240 --> 00:14.340
Yeah.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.685
Let me also say, while this is running, I will not in any way identify where we are.

00:18.865 --> 00:19.106
Good.

00:19.506 --> 00:20.027
New Jersey.

00:20.307 --> 00:20.587
Right.

00:20.647 --> 00:21.528
World New Jersey.

00:21.548 --> 00:22.149
New Jersey is fun.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.050
The world's New Jersey.

00:23.070 --> 00:23.771
Yeah, let me just.

00:25.473 --> 00:26.734
Well, Mrs. Shirley, tell me.

00:26.795 --> 00:27.335
Yes, sir.

00:28.056 --> 00:31.540
Tell me, please, how you became a book collector.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.529
Well, I think that's why I was correcting Carl.

00:36.210 --> 00:46.962
I started collecting a man by the name of Hudson, who's a naturalist, English naturalist, and I got kind of bored with him and didn't like.

00:47.203 --> 00:50.366
You know, I just sort of thought it would be fun to collect something.

00:50.807 --> 00:52.349
I was looking for something to do.

00:52.809 --> 00:54.511
When approximately would this have been?

00:54.531 --> 00:55.913
Well, that's why I corrected Carl.

00:55.953 --> 01:02.961
I think it was about 23, 24 years ago or something, but I didn't really like Mr. Hudson.

01:04.527 --> 01:20.407
And then I went to find a, Carl was making guns, that's why I arrested you, and I thought it would be fun to find an illustrated book about Daniel Boone that had pictures of Kentucky rifles.

01:21.548 --> 01:33.083
And so I happened to go to Justin Schiller's shop, and anyway got fascinated with all his books, did get Carl, Daniel Boone, which I

01:33.367 --> 01:38.014
since stolen away from you and given to Yale, I think.

01:38.455 --> 01:43.102
But anyway, and that sort of started children's books.

01:44.084 --> 01:49.793
I think we should note for the record that you are descended from a very prominent book family.

01:50.634 --> 01:53.919
Did this have anything to do with your interest?

01:54.661 --> 02:00.690
Didn't at the time, because my father, there were three Beinecke brothers, two collected books,

02:01.767 --> 02:08.257
Uh, Uncle Edwin really started collecting books, and I guess he's got the greatest Stevenson collection.

02:09.820 --> 02:22.840
Uncle Fritz started later in life collecting books, and he had, uh, uh, what is his, uh, Lewis and Clark, west of the Mississippi collection that's all at Yale.

02:24.182 --> 02:27.808
My father didn't collect books at all.

02:28.362 --> 02:32.550
in my family, actually, except my brother collected books.

02:32.570 --> 02:39.944
He collected James Barry and Lord Tweedsmore, who is, I forget who.

02:39.964 --> 02:41.788
No, that's B-A-R-R-E, right, Barry?

02:42.409 --> 02:43.491
Barry, yes.

02:43.571 --> 02:44.593
Peter Pan Barry.

02:44.613 --> 02:45.314
Peter, that's what I thought.

02:45.334 --> 02:50.404
And Lord Tweedsmore is, I can't remember his name.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.439
But anyway.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.682
Can I just interrupt for one second?

02:53.702 --> 02:55.964
The Hudson that you were collecting in the beginning, that was who?

02:55.984 --> 02:56.926
Do you remember the first name?

02:58.668 --> 03:00.290
I'll tell you how much I like it.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.912
I'll come up with it a little later.

03:02.472 --> 03:06.577
You'll find I can't remember quite so well.

03:06.878 --> 03:09.321
I'll remember in a minute or two.

03:09.341 --> 03:11.904
He was a naturalist, English naturalist.

03:11.924 --> 03:12.385
I'll find it.

03:12.425 --> 03:13.246
Don't even worry about it.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.268
English naturalist named Hudson.

03:15.288 --> 03:15.789
Yeah.

03:15.809 --> 03:16.610
Okay.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.050
I'm sorry.

03:17.090 --> 03:17.691
Go ahead.

03:18.352 --> 03:19.193
Well, anyway, that's...

03:19.595 --> 03:20.776
That's pretty much it.

03:20.836 --> 03:27.084
Then I started, then I thought, ah, children's books, that'll be fun.

03:27.304 --> 03:31.850
So that's sort of when it started, and I think it had to be about 22 years ago.

03:31.870 --> 03:35.774
So we're talking roughly about 1970, late 60s, early 70s?

03:35.794 --> 03:37.777
Yeah, right around in there.

03:37.797 --> 03:38.017
Okay.

03:38.237 --> 03:42.623
Were you a collector of anything prior to this?

03:42.643 --> 03:45.026
Oh, as a child, I collected matchbooks.

03:45.046 --> 03:49.551
I had a great matchbook collection, paper matches, you know, not

03:50.206 --> 03:57.693
something that said, Taggart's a driving school, but restaurants, you know, all that kind of thing.

03:57.753 --> 03:58.794
I collected that.

03:58.874 --> 04:04.039
I suppose I collected seashells when I was little, didn't everyone?

04:06.622 --> 04:10.986
And then, no, too busy with kids and so forth and so on.

04:13.409 --> 04:20.095
So, now, let me also say that Justin Schiller said that you have put together what his

04:21.020 --> 04:24.464
probably the finest children's book collection in private hands.

04:25.485 --> 04:28.068
So when you went at this, you certainly went at it seriously.

04:28.929 --> 04:29.349
Oh, sure.

04:29.389 --> 04:30.651
Yeah, sure.

04:30.671 --> 04:42.424
I think Carl was doing his guns in the cellar, and I thought, well, geez, having such a good time, I should be doing something just as much fun.

04:42.725 --> 04:44.306
I think maybe that was it.

04:45.167 --> 04:50.233
But did it occur to you that if I'm going to do this, I'm going to try and

04:51.007 --> 04:52.129
do it very, very well?

04:53.250 --> 04:54.512
I think probably.

04:54.792 --> 04:55.733
Once I got started.

04:55.773 --> 05:03.804
Because Justin's a terrific salesman, too, I forget.

05:03.824 --> 05:11.615
Did you know pretty much that you wanted illustrated books, books of... No, I wanted American first edition.

05:11.855 --> 05:16.942
Okay, let's define when you decided to become a collector now what you... I wanted American books.

05:16.962 --> 05:17.723
They could be...

05:18.395 --> 05:30.194
I started collecting, I thought the most, I knew enough to know that the early, early books were very religious, moralizing, didactic.

05:30.495 --> 05:31.016
Good words.

05:31.036 --> 05:33.460
Wonderful words.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.102
And I thought that was pretty boring.

05:35.683 --> 05:43.356
So I thought I wanted to start around 1815, because I guess I knew that they had color illustrations

05:43.775 --> 05:45.097
And they were fun.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.478
They were nursery rhymes.

05:46.518 --> 05:47.840
They were this, they were that.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.322
Copies of the English.

05:50.143 --> 05:56.030
But I wanted the American first editions, even if they were copies of the English.

05:56.090 --> 06:00.997
So it started with sort of the earliest date, 1815.

06:01.097 --> 06:11.790
Then, of course, what I discovered was that all those early ones were fascinating and had a lot of

06:11.956 --> 06:16.380
thick groin kind of things, or little early woodcuts that were fascinating.

06:18.122 --> 06:27.431
And so it was quite a job catching up to going back to forever, or forever when we started.

06:27.452 --> 06:36.420
So, I started with about 1815, only because they were fun, they were humorous, they were interesting to me.

06:37.562 --> 06:41.946
And then realized that, of course, the others were wonderful, and what was I doing?

06:43.580 --> 06:49.669
And at that time, I don't think anyone was, they were interested, people were interested mainly.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.211
So the prices were pretty good.

06:51.271 --> 07:01.606
They were interested in English, French, German, not particularly interested in American, for instance.

07:01.626 --> 07:08.135
So I was ahead on that one, meaning nobody else particularly wanted them except me.

07:08.155 --> 07:09.216
That's nice.

07:09.236 --> 07:09.917
That was nice.

07:10.378 --> 07:12.161
It changed.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.182
It changed.

07:13.718 --> 07:23.789
Just as a parenthetical note, you have some wonderful paintings which were, I guess, originally produced, executed to illustrate children's books.

07:24.109 --> 07:28.033
Was this another collection that kind of developed as a consequence of this?

07:28.174 --> 07:42.409
Yes, it was a consequence of the other, that suddenly, you know, thinking back, I realized how important the illustrations were to me, and that it was all part of the book.

07:44.009 --> 07:46.351
Were you trying to document something?

07:47.452 --> 07:51.596
Yeah, I was trying to, I guess gradually.

07:51.636 --> 08:11.835
I'm trying to document what Young America read, and from that you can sort of tell what was going on, how people treated the young, what they produced for the young.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.476
Have you been able to

08:13.962 --> 08:21.088
Are there any tentative conclusions about... No, I'm not that smart.

08:21.288 --> 08:24.271
Sure, you are in a certain way.

08:25.232 --> 08:43.868
Certainly all those books till, well, probably till the Civil War always seem to have a moral, maybe a religious message.

08:44.084 --> 08:44.825
to children.

08:48.209 --> 08:54.417
Christmas wasn't a legal holiday to Massachusetts until about 1855.

08:54.597 --> 08:56.560
I didn't know that.

08:56.580 --> 09:04.270
So, yeah, so gradually, and then there was a great trend against fairy stories.

09:05.131 --> 09:07.253
That was... Against them?

09:07.273 --> 09:08.134
Oh, yeah.

09:10.037 --> 09:13.281
Things should be, now I forget, you'll have to look this up, but

09:14.442 --> 09:26.119
I think it was Rousseau in France and Panama, maybe, and everything was, fairy stories were terrible, bad for children.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.365
Things should be realistic, and it was very bad.

09:30.506 --> 09:33.430
They were taking the joy and the wonder out of being young, apparently.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.712
Yes.

09:34.732 --> 09:38.938
The fairies were bad.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.682
So that took a while, and there are things.

09:42.472 --> 09:54.309
like Grimm's, and you can sort of see that after about 20-odd years that there aren't any Grimm's fairy tales coming up from the first American edition.

09:54.730 --> 10:02.060
But this happened in England, too, from the earliest Grimm's, well, for quite a long time.

10:02.701 --> 10:08.209
Maybe there might be one edition or something until, say, after the Civil War.

10:09.961 --> 10:13.225
Did you establish a cutoff date for yourself?

10:13.906 --> 10:15.207
No, it was not too bad.

10:15.287 --> 10:18.651
I did, sort of, but it didn't work.

10:18.671 --> 10:21.314
But what was the original cutoff date?

10:21.334 --> 10:24.738
1900, in my mind, was the original cutoff date.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.261
But then there was The Wizard of Oz.

10:27.281 --> 10:28.222
How could you avoid that?

10:28.242 --> 10:35.370
Yeah, it was Dr. Doolittle, and then there were... So, yes, I'm more interested in the old ones.

10:36.371 --> 10:39.715
I do get, if I see them,

10:40.606 --> 10:47.138
when they come out, but I like the Newbury and Caldecon to get those, but then there's Dr. Seuss.

10:47.659 --> 10:49.442
So you're collecting right up until today, then?

10:49.943 --> 10:50.945
No, not really.

10:51.486 --> 10:52.087
Not really.

10:52.568 --> 10:58.880
But certain people, Dr. Seuss, uh, who else?

10:58.900 --> 11:03.188
Eloise, Ludwig Benelmans, uh,

11:03.353 --> 11:06.177
No, I had never heard of Ludwig Bimmelmann's book.

11:06.217 --> 11:07.378
Well, he wrote Madeline.

11:07.478 --> 11:08.820
Do you remember Madeline?

11:08.840 --> 11:08.920
Yes.

11:08.940 --> 11:10.062
You remember Madeline.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.163
That's a girl book.

11:13.186 --> 11:14.447
You remember boy books.

11:14.768 --> 11:14.888
Right.

11:14.908 --> 11:23.479
No, but I heard about him because one of my subjects, Schefter Zathmari from Chicago, the first book he bought in America was a Ludwig Bimmelmann's book.

11:23.499 --> 11:24.721
I just wrote about him.

11:24.741 --> 11:25.722
Well, he's funny.

11:26.343 --> 11:26.883
He's funny.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.666
And they're neat children's books.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.508
Did he do food books, too?

11:30.995 --> 11:31.756
No.

11:31.956 --> 11:36.621
Well, he might have that I don't know of, but I don't think so.

11:39.564 --> 11:40.746
Tell me a little bit now.

11:41.606 --> 11:49.135
Did you anticipate when you started that at some point this would be a collection that would be going to an institution such as you?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.396
No, I don't think so.

11:50.736 --> 11:53.519
You know, gradually it seemed to get bigger and bigger.

11:54.180 --> 11:58.825
But when did it occur to you that you were probably producing something that would really have

11:59.294 --> 12:03.679
a profound scholarly application, let's put it.

12:03.699 --> 12:04.079
I don't know.

12:04.099 --> 12:04.820
Do you think she does?

12:06.161 --> 12:07.123
You almost think so.

12:08.164 --> 12:08.945
Yeah, they're pleased.

12:09.045 --> 12:10.266
I think they're pleased.

12:10.626 --> 12:13.610
I don't think they really thought about children's books.

12:13.810 --> 12:22.519
I think children's books, honestly, are really a window onto history.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.080
Really.

12:23.881 --> 12:24.642
Don't you?

12:25.523 --> 12:26.003
Yeah.

12:26.023 --> 12:27.765
Don't you?

12:28.032 --> 12:34.839
You know, between, you know, today, it's so different for the kids.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.503
All this moralizing stuff, and then I forget what her name is.

12:41.405 --> 12:44.168
You know, it's quite different.

12:44.188 --> 12:47.412
I've got a paperback that says, you can say no to drugs.

12:47.472 --> 12:53.317
Well, I thought I'd better get that for 1991, 89, whatever it was.

12:53.337 --> 12:56.841
So it's quite different, but I've got a book.

12:57.361 --> 13:03.271
1877, it's called something like The House I Live In.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.257
I just got it, so that's how I can tell you that.

13:07.098 --> 13:14.431
And there's no author, but it's for school children about the evils of tobacco, drugs, and drink.

13:14.471 --> 13:15.793
Of course, it's a temperance book.

13:15.934 --> 13:20.702
So, you know, but it's the same thing as today, in a way.

13:22.505 --> 13:25.049
written in a little different style of paperback.

13:25.710 --> 13:30.897
Pick up a little bit more on the Window in the World observation.

13:30.917 --> 13:34.523
She said that children's books are a little endow in history, I guess.

13:34.683 --> 13:51.347
Well, I think you knew how, well, the Grolier Club put out a, had an exhibit, show, I was going to call it, exhibit, that

13:52.745 --> 14:01.395
The hundred most influential books, I think it's called.

14:01.735 --> 14:02.316
Have you seen that?

14:02.656 --> 14:04.398
You must have seen that.

14:04.919 --> 14:08.042
Up to, I forget when.

14:08.062 --> 14:12.587
Well, that's the greater list of the 100 most influential books in history, I guess.

14:13.268 --> 14:17.153
And I think 27 of those are children's books.

14:17.173 --> 14:17.573
Really?

14:17.773 --> 14:18.875
Yeah, I counted them.

14:19.716 --> 14:20.557
Well, that's very it.

14:20.577 --> 14:20.997
No, thanks.

14:21.213 --> 14:24.596
Very, very, very interesting, isn't it?

14:25.557 --> 14:26.778
Twenty-seven of the glory of the hundred.

14:26.798 --> 14:27.839
Twenty-seven of the hundred.

14:28.760 --> 14:33.785
And you could stretch it to a little bit more so that it almost makes a third.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.526
How did you decide what was a children's book?

14:35.927 --> 14:37.689
Like Huckleberry Finn, is that a children's book?

14:37.709 --> 14:38.509
Huckleberry Finn.

14:38.609 --> 14:41.072
Yeah, but that's also an adult book, too, wouldn't you say?

14:41.372 --> 14:42.833
But it's a children's book.

14:43.514 --> 14:46.557
I think it's read in every high school, isn't it?

14:46.577 --> 14:47.258
It's on the reading.

14:47.698 --> 14:49.920
He says at the very beginning that

14:50.508 --> 14:58.316
I guess I'm naming this for kids, but I'd like to think that the older reader will get a little something out of it.

14:58.336 --> 15:01.078
I think it's meant to be that Moby Dick, aren't they?

15:04.201 --> 15:09.466
Meant to be the two major American books?

15:09.486 --> 15:11.148
Certainly of the 19th century.

15:11.608 --> 15:14.731
Scarlet Letter, you'd have to throw in there, I think.

15:14.751 --> 15:15.953
Probably, yeah.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.536
But I don't think Moby Dick was written for kids, though.

15:19.685 --> 15:24.711
No, it wasn't written for kids, thank God, which means we don't have to try to buy it.

15:24.851 --> 15:25.652
It's impossible.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.216
Billion dollars.

15:28.917 --> 15:29.637
Unbelievable.

15:31.880 --> 15:39.490
Did you develop a want list, or did you kind of rely on the judgment of Justin Schiller?

15:40.371 --> 15:49.202
Well, Justin, the way Justin fits in is that I think he's probably the most knowledgeable person

15:50.853 --> 15:54.477
book dealer in children's books.

15:54.698 --> 16:00.585
And that means, I think, France, Germany, all over the world.

16:01.005 --> 16:02.647
I think he's the best.

16:02.667 --> 16:07.834
So, of course, he comes up with things, and then I come up with things.

16:08.755 --> 16:10.918
And if I come up, he thinks, that's great.

16:13.921 --> 16:16.204
Then what he's looking for.

16:16.705 --> 16:19.408
But, you know, after a while,

16:19.844 --> 16:27.977
It's like Christmas catalogs almost daily in the mail, which are fun to look at and see, and some things fit.

16:28.037 --> 16:33.245
But you learn something from all these book dealers that know their business.

16:33.265 --> 16:35.749
They're pretty well cataloged.

16:35.769 --> 16:36.711
They have to be.

16:36.731 --> 16:37.071
Yeah.

16:39.094 --> 16:43.622
Do you have favorites in the collections that are, which I hope you'll show them.

16:43.702 --> 16:44.483
I'm sure you'll show us.

16:44.603 --> 16:45.645
I like everything.

16:45.985 --> 16:46.266
You do?

16:46.606 --> 16:47.708
Well, almost everything.

16:48.667 --> 17:00.441
You know, you do get a couple of things that, uh, that are pretty boring, like a short essay on baptism.

17:00.461 --> 17:01.463
Well, why would you buy that?

17:01.963 --> 17:13.317
Well, because it was, it's for children, about, uh, and it was by Jonathan Fisher, who actually was an early American illustrator, too.

17:13.898 --> 17:16.581
He's a minister in, uh,

17:18.822 --> 17:19.523
Where is it?

17:19.543 --> 17:20.124
Blueville, Maine.

17:20.604 --> 17:21.826
You're going up and take a nap.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.228
I didn't lose it.

17:23.248 --> 17:25.290
I was going to bring the wine and wine out.

17:25.351 --> 17:26.011
That's for me.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.233
Not for me either.

17:28.034 --> 17:30.758
No, I would have if he hadn't had the tape on.

17:33.321 --> 17:33.701
Good night.

17:34.502 --> 17:36.485
I'm going to listen for a minute if you don't mind.

17:36.505 --> 17:38.728
Okay, this is nice.

17:39.970 --> 17:45.657
Did you say, do you develop a want list or do you pretty much know that you want something when you see it?

17:46.210 --> 17:48.553
I think I know that I want it if I see it.

17:49.154 --> 17:53.661
I don't think there's such a thing as a want, really.

17:54.342 --> 17:58.127
Especially with children's books, because it's so hard to know what you want.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.489
It's not what you want.

17:59.509 --> 18:07.020
There's an awful lot of, I don't know what the word is, association.

18:07.121 --> 18:14.952
You see something, and then you think, oh, gee whiz, that should be here, because it goes with such and such.

18:15.725 --> 18:19.809
I do have a want list, like Peter Polly to Penrod.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.231
Do you know what that is?

18:22.012 --> 18:24.795
Well, that is Jacob Blank.

18:24.815 --> 18:25.876
Oh, Jacob Blank.

18:25.936 --> 18:45.057
He wrote a book called Peter Polly to Penrod, and Peter Polly was Samuel Goodrich, and that's the first book in Blank's list, and this is the most influential children's books, meaning from Peter Polly to Penrod, which would be from

18:45.560 --> 18:50.907
1827 to 1922, maybe, was it?

18:51.148 --> 18:54.112
I didn't know Blank did a children.

18:54.132 --> 19:00.441
Yeah, so that's sort of a guide that, gee, should have those books.

19:00.461 --> 19:03.625
So, yes, I want lists for the ones that I don't have on that.

19:04.346 --> 19:05.328
Do you have?

19:05.588 --> 19:06.289
I have most of them.

19:06.309 --> 19:07.611
Most of them?

19:07.631 --> 19:10.174
I'm missing.

19:10.195 --> 19:12.157
Six, seven, something like that.

19:12.257 --> 19:12.858
Out of how many?

19:13.219 --> 19:13.719
I don't know.

19:13.940 --> 19:14.841
I can't remember.

19:16.188 --> 19:20.374
Wow, that's a pretty significant collection.

19:20.394 --> 19:24.501
Well, I think that probably people would have every one of them.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.103
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

19:26.123 --> 19:26.584
I don't know.

19:27.085 --> 19:27.565
I don't know.

19:27.585 --> 19:30.971
I think that your collection is probably... Justin would know that.

19:31.511 --> 19:41.747
But I'm sure that... But Justin told me that, to quote him again, that your collection is, in his estimation, the finest in private hands.

19:43.029 --> 19:43.991
Well, that'd be great.

19:44.271 --> 19:44.912
And...

19:45.112 --> 19:46.473
But I don't know that it is.

19:47.414 --> 20:03.671
And actually, I don't know, I guess, any private collector that, but I know Philadelphia Public Library, California.

20:03.931 --> 20:06.534
AAS, yeah.

20:08.035 --> 20:12.139
Oh, there are lots, but they're all institutions.

20:12.159 --> 20:14.882
And of course, they have some super, super things that

20:15.166 --> 20:16.768
Morgan has some nice things.

20:17.048 --> 20:19.652
Morgan, that's... Oh, and Indiana, too.

20:19.672 --> 20:21.494
And IU has some nice things.

20:21.514 --> 20:22.616
Lily has some nice things.

20:22.636 --> 20:24.118
Princeton has some nice things.

20:24.158 --> 20:27.842
The Osborne Collection in Toronto is exceptional.

20:27.923 --> 20:30.206
The Opie Collection at the Bodleian.

20:30.326 --> 20:31.647
Yeah, all of them.

20:31.988 --> 20:32.669
It's very important.

20:32.809 --> 20:36.494
So I don't know where... But every one we just mentioned, you see, is in an institution.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.579
Well, these are going to announce... I know.

20:40.699 --> 20:44.464
One of the themes that I'm trying to develop is how...

20:44.866 --> 20:50.932
how much institutions rely and depend on people such as yourself.

20:51.592 --> 21:03.763
Well, this is true, and of course the kids have said, well now, you've had so much fun buying, because it's too bad to put it in an institution, and other people not have the fun of getting things.

21:03.864 --> 21:14.113
And I must say the old books, the chapbooks, you know, the pre, let's say 1820, which is AAA,

21:14.633 --> 21:20.021
Well, you don't see too many of them, very much.

21:20.482 --> 21:22.425
Is condition important to you?

21:22.585 --> 21:25.369
Yes, and that's what Justin's great at.

21:26.471 --> 21:34.523
Honestly, I don't think he buys anything that's not in really good condition.

21:34.804 --> 21:35.705
And yes, it is.

21:35.866 --> 21:37.909
It's just great to have them.

21:37.969 --> 21:41.434
Because when you think of children's books, they're published for children.

21:41.887 --> 22:09.109
yeah and you can tell with it i mean a lot of these things that i don't you know i get tired of the didactic ones they're beautiful drawing well no child ever bothered to read it and then you find something fun and there's scribbling on one side of the page and name and a drawing and you just know that they loved it

22:09.460 --> 22:12.084
And that expression, they loved it to them.

22:13.566 --> 22:20.255
So, yes, I do get some things that aren't in great condition, but it's the only way I'm going to get them.

22:20.535 --> 22:31.350
But I imagine when you have a case like that, a book like that, where a kid from 75 or 80 or 100 years ago, and it's...

22:31.533 --> 22:32.654
It's part of the charm.

22:32.754 --> 22:36.999
You're jumping back, and you're looking at a child a hundred years ago, and the reaction.

22:37.319 --> 22:37.960
Yeah, right.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.903
And there's something really very, very great.

22:41.083 --> 22:55.839
Yeah, and I think AAS is redoing their children's catalog now, and I think they're putting in the inscriptions.

22:56.259 --> 22:59.683
You know, it's very formal.

23:01.250 --> 23:21.456
Nicholas from his brother Jonathan on Christmas, or it might be Nicholas for his diligence and so forth from a Sunday school teacher, and you know, all those add to it.

23:21.997 --> 23:24.220
But most of the Sunday school ones

23:24.638 --> 23:25.880
We're in good shape.

23:27.242 --> 23:27.862
We're rich.

23:28.664 --> 23:35.793
But I don't think the books, actually, that they pass out at high school graduations get read too much either.

23:35.813 --> 23:36.194
Do you?

23:37.496 --> 23:40.760
Well, have you heard of Ruth Baldwin's collection down there?

23:40.780 --> 23:41.521
Oh, sure.

23:41.541 --> 23:44.345
I went to see that about a year and a half ago, and I'm writing about her.

23:44.365 --> 23:46.368
That's where Bernie McTeague is.

23:47.229 --> 23:51.174
Bernie's the one who told me that I really had to go down there.

23:51.234 --> 23:51.675
It's great.

23:52.043 --> 23:54.526
And he said, you're not going to believe this thing.

23:54.647 --> 23:54.827
Yeah.

23:55.047 --> 24:01.596
And in fact, this woman quite pointedly wanted books that had been read, that had been handled.

24:01.736 --> 24:01.917
Yeah.

24:02.197 --> 24:04.780
And condition was totally irrelevant to her.

24:04.800 --> 24:04.901
Yeah.

24:05.201 --> 24:08.105
She preferred, I mean, you see some of these books with little fingerprints on them.

24:08.125 --> 24:08.566
Oh, sure.

24:09.487 --> 24:09.587
Yeah.

24:09.607 --> 24:10.628
Jam or whatever it is.

24:10.649 --> 24:10.749
Yeah.

24:10.769 --> 24:11.650
You don't know what it is.

24:11.850 --> 24:12.771
And scribblings.

24:12.791 --> 24:13.573
And scribblings.

24:13.593 --> 24:16.016
And, and, and it's just a charm there.

24:16.196 --> 24:16.456
Yeah.

24:16.757 --> 24:20.722
You jump back a hundred years and, and the kid could be right here, you know.

24:20.822 --> 24:21.223
Yeah.

24:21.693 --> 24:29.640
were little drawings of somebody in a colonial suit that the child was drawn in.

24:29.800 --> 24:35.084
Did you find any, did you find a coolness on the part of Yale when you first proposed?

24:35.545 --> 24:42.270
Do you think that they perhaps thought that a collection of children's books maybe didn't have a scholarly application?

24:42.290 --> 24:45.873
Did you have to persuade them that this was something that they ought to?

24:46.093 --> 24:48.555
I think they, the light.

24:48.575 --> 24:51.598
I think Ralph, Ralph,

24:53.030 --> 24:54.432
Franklin.

24:54.593 --> 24:55.354
I thought it was great.

24:55.975 --> 25:00.803
And Vincent Giroux, who I sort of work with, thought it was great.

25:02.305 --> 25:02.846
That's great.

25:03.888 --> 25:04.349
And how is it?

25:04.369 --> 25:05.951
Are you moving it up gradually?

25:06.613 --> 25:10.779
Yeah, I'm trying to do it in some kind of a logical order.

25:10.880 --> 25:15.367
But I do my own cataloging and put them right away behind.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.953
And I don't want to use

25:19.321 --> 25:22.967
a computer because it's too late to start using a computer.

25:22.987 --> 25:27.874
So I have a file for authors.

25:28.014 --> 25:30.778
I have a file with a description book.

25:30.859 --> 25:33.302
I have a file for the publishers.

25:33.523 --> 25:36.407
I have a file for the artists.

25:36.727 --> 25:40.073
I have a file for where I got it when.

25:41.455 --> 25:43.458
There's another file I can't remember.

25:43.478 --> 25:48.265
So each book may have four or five entries.

25:49.004 --> 25:51.809
on a page, on a separate page.

25:51.829 --> 25:57.679
So it texts me, you know, my kids say, is that a typewriter?

25:57.699 --> 25:59.361
Is that what a typewriter is like?

25:59.462 --> 26:03.749
That's right, they don't have typewriters anymore.

26:03.989 --> 26:04.931
No, no.

26:05.031 --> 26:09.819
So, but I'm sure not going to start from the beginning again.

26:09.839 --> 26:12.804
Could you give me a rough idea of how large the collection is?

26:12.824 --> 26:14.186
No, I have no idea.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.248
I really don't.

26:15.818 --> 26:17.760
I have no idea.

26:17.820 --> 26:18.120
Really?

26:18.140 --> 26:21.043
10,000, 15,000, 20,000 titles?

26:21.284 --> 26:22.004
I have no idea.

26:22.024 --> 26:24.147
I'll show you the seller before you leave.

26:24.347 --> 26:25.648
I'll show you where the books are.

26:25.768 --> 26:26.409
And I'll make a guess.

26:26.469 --> 26:28.852
And then you can go to Yale and see what they've got there.

26:28.932 --> 26:29.352
Okay.

26:29.572 --> 26:30.593
And you can make a guess.

26:30.794 --> 26:32.495
I honestly don't know.

26:34.297 --> 26:38.722
And when did you start sending them over to Yale?

26:38.782 --> 26:40.524
Is this something that's just started recently?

26:41.545 --> 26:43.547
Oh, that's a nice call.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.984
Maybe three, four years ago, three years ago, four years ago.

26:48.004 --> 26:48.745
Good.

26:48.765 --> 26:50.106
I'll give Ralph a call then.

26:50.146 --> 26:54.311
Maybe he can give me a quote on it.

26:54.411 --> 26:56.253
Ask for Vincent Giraud.

26:57.915 --> 26:59.316
B-I-N-C-E-N-T.

26:59.336 --> 27:00.698
He's a Frenchman.

27:00.718 --> 27:02.580
B-I-N-C-E-N-T.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.403
G-E-R-A-U-D.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.085
Okay, I've heard of him before.

27:07.105 --> 27:13.872
Yeah, and he's the guy that I hadn't exhibited yet last year.

27:14.577 --> 27:16.300
And I'll give you a panel on it.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.041
Oh, I'd love that.

27:17.482 --> 27:17.602
Yeah.

27:18.002 --> 27:20.586
And it was a good show.

27:21.127 --> 27:23.010
And Maurice Sendak, do you know him?

27:23.050 --> 27:23.331
Yes.

27:23.671 --> 27:24.933
And he came up and opened it.

27:24.953 --> 27:25.835
Well, he's a collector, too.

27:26.015 --> 27:26.375
Yeah.

27:26.936 --> 27:27.918
You want to go see him?

27:28.919 --> 27:31.564
Yeah, Sendak supposedly really is quite a collector.

27:31.584 --> 27:32.785
Yeah.

27:32.805 --> 27:34.949
And I've met him a couple times.

27:35.390 --> 27:36.291
He's great.

27:36.311 --> 27:36.892
He's neat.

27:37.313 --> 27:37.893
He's wonderful.

27:38.034 --> 27:38.595
Yeah.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.756
I love his stuff.

27:39.776 --> 27:40.838
Yeah, so do I.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.933
I don't like it very much.

27:43.173 --> 27:46.278
They've got a great Sendak collection at the Rosenbach of Philadelphia.

27:46.338 --> 27:46.678
I know.

27:46.698 --> 27:57.374
I've got three of his original drawings, but mine are studies for, because all his original drawings go to Rosenbach.

27:59.056 --> 28:03.342
But I like it, and he sees an awful lot.

28:03.362 --> 28:03.703
Lovely.

28:03.823 --> 28:05.946
I've met him a couple of times.

28:05.966 --> 28:06.066
Yeah.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.806
You ought to go see him.

28:07.886 --> 28:09.648
I don't know if he would want you.

28:09.928 --> 28:12.070
I mean, is he quiet?

28:12.591 --> 28:14.292
I think he changes a little bit.

28:14.313 --> 28:22.520
Yeah, when I interviewed him the first couple times, it was about his work, not his collecting.

28:22.540 --> 28:26.024
And he liked the stories that I wrote, so that was kind of nice.

28:26.865 --> 28:30.248
I left your article in The Times, and I don't know how I'll miss that.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.652
But I also don't remember the story about...

28:36.337 --> 28:37.358
Who's the publishing?

28:38.339 --> 28:39.341
Bingham's, yeah.

28:39.641 --> 28:48.111
And I must, we must have been away, or once in a while, if the weather's bad or something, we missed the paper, and I'm too lazy to go get it.

28:49.512 --> 28:52.135
I'm just looking at that wonderful carving on that chair.

28:52.276 --> 28:53.978
That's a funny thing.

28:54.218 --> 29:02.007
These were Carl's mother's, and they're in Maine, and their house in Maine.

29:02.527 --> 29:04.389
I said, Carl, we've got to bring those down.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.911
There's two of them, one on rockers and one not.

29:07.832 --> 29:12.416
And that has to be Captain January, which was in Child's book.

29:12.436 --> 29:18.022
It's about a lighthouse keeper who rescues a baby lashed to a board or something like that.

29:18.983 --> 29:21.165
And that's what it has to be around 1900.

29:21.305 --> 29:25.869
It was so funny, because if it fits right in, we'll have to bring them down.

29:25.889 --> 29:26.190
Sure.

29:26.230 --> 29:26.690
Yeah.

29:26.990 --> 29:29.833
Do you have Celia Thaxter's lighthouse keeper's daughter?

29:31.450 --> 29:31.810
No.

29:32.091 --> 29:34.975
I have everything that she did except for that.

29:35.636 --> 29:36.036
Have you?

29:36.256 --> 29:39.441
Oh, I've got a great vest collection there.

29:39.541 --> 29:41.343
Oh, because that ties in with your passion.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.026
That ties in with your passion.

29:43.086 --> 29:44.648
That's how it started, actually.

29:44.668 --> 29:46.070
I started collecting it for that.

29:46.090 --> 29:46.590
That's great.

29:47.071 --> 29:50.536
We have friends who... Gosh, how does that relate?

29:51.277 --> 29:52.198
They're in the Navy.

29:52.538 --> 29:53.380
We're in the Navy.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.421
They're retired now.

29:55.402 --> 29:59.668
And they were married in... during the war in...

30:03.766 --> 30:11.155
Well, anyway, whoever it is that they stayed with in, it's not Kennebunk.

30:12.757 --> 30:17.043
I guess maybe it is Kennebunk, but it's on the coast, right across from that island.

30:17.063 --> 30:18.284
Yeah, the Isles of Shoals.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.946
Isles of Shoals.

30:20.827 --> 30:23.631
And anyway, she had lots of stories to tell.

30:23.651 --> 30:26.314
She was that old that she could tell me all about.

30:26.868 --> 30:30.893
all about Cedar Baxter and all about... What an interesting woman.

30:31.053 --> 30:32.154
She must have been.

30:32.174 --> 30:33.355
I don't know too much about her.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.196
I've read quite a bit.

30:34.216 --> 30:35.678
Actually, there was a granddaughter.

30:35.698 --> 30:37.861
She did quite a few children's poems and things.

30:37.881 --> 30:38.682
Poems, yeah.

30:38.702 --> 30:39.983
She's just gone with the wind.

30:40.043 --> 30:40.924
Yeah.

30:40.944 --> 30:43.207
She was a contemporary of Emily Dickinson.

30:43.227 --> 30:43.567
Yeah.

30:43.827 --> 30:46.390
And in her time, Cedar was right up there.

30:46.410 --> 30:46.831
That's right.

30:46.851 --> 30:48.012
Just below Longfellow.

30:48.052 --> 30:52.017
They seemed to, you know... And Emily couldn't get a thing published.

30:52.097 --> 30:55.761
And then all of a sudden, Cedar, nobody knows who she was...

30:56.264 --> 31:00.388
Celia Fated and Emily King is very collectible right now.

31:00.428 --> 31:01.109
She's wonderful.

31:01.949 --> 31:09.897
Ralph Franklin, who's the director of the library at Yale, he is the expert on Dickinson.

31:09.917 --> 31:10.577
I didn't know that.

31:11.038 --> 31:23.149
And he's writing, he's been working on it, I think it's going to be maybe three volumes on Emily Dickinson, and that's his specialty, and he's meant to be the

31:23.230 --> 31:48.850
not meant to be i think he is the authority on uh dickinson i love uh pardon me if i keep looking over at the ass i'm over there just you're roaring me in uh carrie did you have any questions that you like that that pretty covers it doesn't it i would love to see a few of your books one other quick question yeah you did mention to me on the phone

31:49.302 --> 31:54.450
that you had an exhibit at the public library, and it was Yankee Doodle?

31:54.470 --> 31:54.690
Yeah.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.132
And tell me a little bit about that.

31:56.252 --> 32:05.947
Well, that was through Bernie McTeague, and what happened here is there's a small museum in Morristown called McCulloch Hall, which is delightful.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.189
It's an old house.

32:07.209 --> 32:18.786
It was at one time somebody's home, but they also had school classes and so forth, which has a broad collection, but a great nest collection.

32:19.238 --> 32:30.330
Because Nast lived across the street in Morristown from McCullough Hall, and actually several people did.

32:32.632 --> 32:33.593
Here I go again.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.956
Not Frost.

32:38.479 --> 32:38.719
No.

32:40.701 --> 32:45.246
Well, Walt Whitman was down in search.

32:45.732 --> 32:48.475
Walter Porzheimer collects also children's books.

32:48.575 --> 32:52.700
It was his father's collection.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.121
Stockton.

32:54.141 --> 32:55.483
He lived here in Northeastern.

32:55.603 --> 32:57.325
Anyway, there were several.

32:58.506 --> 33:09.318
And so they had... I don't know how Bernie got out here, but then they said, would you like to lend us some books for a Christmas thing, which I did.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.822
Bernie probably threw Justin.

33:12.922 --> 33:13.663
I don't know.

33:13.998 --> 33:18.464
came out and saw it and said, how about moving this to New York Public?

33:18.484 --> 33:21.809
So I said, sure, so I can give you that catalog.

33:21.849 --> 33:23.551
But I said I didn't want my name in.

33:24.152 --> 33:34.546
So at that time, I don't think anything had been given to Yale, whenever that was, the dates on the thing.

33:35.507 --> 33:37.309
So that's how I got to know Bernie.

33:38.371 --> 33:39.212
And then...

33:41.487 --> 34:02.938
with much much much editing on bernie's part i wrote an article about santa claus for that time bernie was editor of some magazine collectors i've got one upstairs i'll have to find that but anyway

34:04.117 --> 34:09.244
I'm sure it was completely written, rewritten by Bernie, because it was terrible.

34:09.264 --> 34:13.129
Spelling, population, grammar, as is the Elkhart.

34:15.712 --> 34:21.580
I did it, but they did a lot of grammar, spelling, you know, all that kind of thing.

34:22.701 --> 34:34.056
So that, and then the Brandywine, I lent them a lot of illustrations, and they had a Christmas exhibit of

34:34.340 --> 34:36.864
children's illustrations.

34:37.926 --> 34:40.350
Take a look at the stairs when I get the fun.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.975
This up, I'll show you what it is.

34:43.995 --> 34:49.144
This is maybe a third, quarter, quarter of what's going.

34:49.284 --> 34:50.806
They won't have time to mat it.

34:51.888 --> 34:53.791
This is going to be a one collector exhibit?

34:54.452 --> 34:58.899
Yes, it's going to be, how do you like the title?

34:58.979 --> 34:59.520
Mine.

34:59.855 --> 35:00.656
Dream Makers.

35:01.518 --> 35:02.920
That's a good title.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.202
That's a great one.

35:04.242 --> 35:15.461
Yeah, so it's Dream Makers, and the gal that's the curator of American art used to work at AAS.

35:15.682 --> 35:15.822
Really?

35:16.683 --> 35:19.388
And shall I forget how I know Judy.

35:19.828 --> 35:24.917
She was from California, and she did this

35:26.450 --> 35:28.293
Well, she's done a couple of things.

35:28.333 --> 35:28.794
Where is this?

35:28.814 --> 35:29.795
I'm sorry.

35:29.815 --> 35:31.518
It's a high museum in Atlanta.

35:31.658 --> 35:32.239
Oh, it's Atlanta.

35:32.259 --> 35:38.087
So they're picking up some things tomorrow that they want to reframe or do such and such.

35:38.208 --> 35:40.131
I'm overwhelmed by this.

35:40.852 --> 35:46.720
So all the ones that have this tag are eventually going to Atlanta.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.705
There's the Palmer Cox Brownie books.

35:49.725 --> 35:49.865
Oh.

35:51.067 --> 35:54.432
Well, this is Dolly, and it

35:55.238 --> 35:57.701
You know, he said, what's on your list?

35:58.242 --> 36:03.728
I thought this probably was for, try to think the title.

36:06.412 --> 36:07.133
It wasn't.

36:07.193 --> 36:14.422
And then just by chance, I got an Appleton almanac, and there was that picture in it.

36:14.522 --> 36:16.304
I thought it was Margaret, it was called.

36:17.205 --> 36:18.947
And I thought it was for that, but it's not.

36:19.448 --> 36:21.230
He did some Washington Irving stuff, right?

36:21.270 --> 36:23.693
Yes, he did a lot of stuff.

36:24.348 --> 36:28.294
And this is named by S. Stevens, who I love, and that was in St.

36:28.334 --> 36:29.516
Nicholas magazine.

36:29.536 --> 36:30.578
Found that later.

36:31.439 --> 36:35.906
But he's better than that, because his things are really much better than that.

36:35.926 --> 36:46.322
This is an alphabet, and if you really look, you can see the A, and there's the C, and the D.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.279
I love this.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.584
This is wonderful.

36:50.065 --> 36:51.568
Yeah, well, you just hit it right.

36:52.449 --> 36:55.195
Actually, a couple of things are going down.

36:55.916 --> 36:58.842
And the staircase is perfect.

36:58.882 --> 37:04.092
Well, what's great is the wallpaper because, for instance,

37:05.236 --> 37:11.965
I keep putting nails in and changing things, and you can't see, you see.

37:11.985 --> 37:12.746
So this is, let's see.

37:12.946 --> 37:14.388
Oh, these are wonderful.

37:14.949 --> 37:27.486
This is the funnest piece for Peterkin papers, which was actually the first humorous book written for children without a moral.

37:27.566 --> 37:34.315
Mrs. Peterkins was a lady from Philadelphia, and, you know, she couldn't get the Christmas tree in the house

37:35.122 --> 37:39.048
Without cutting a hole in the ceiling, you couldn't figure it out.

37:39.068 --> 37:41.652
The piano stayed on the porch, because they couldn't get in.

37:41.812 --> 37:45.297
You played through the window, you know, that kind of thing.

37:45.317 --> 37:47.680
This guy, now, I've got to try and remember his name.

37:48.401 --> 37:52.447
I'm lost for a minute.

37:52.768 --> 37:59.177
But anyway, that's a woodcut from his alphabet, which is based on the Englishman Nicholson's hand.

37:59.357 --> 38:00.780
That's a wonderful look at that.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.821
It's nice, isn't it?

38:02.105 --> 38:06.089
You pulled that a couple times through the block, too, didn't you?

38:06.109 --> 38:16.639
This, I mean, this is not a, another funny, I have four of these, which I got from Justin, and they were for blocks, wooden blocks, eight-sided wooden blocks.

38:16.919 --> 38:17.680
Oh, wow.

38:17.700 --> 38:26.269
That he did of the brownies for McGlaw prints, and maybe two years later, there in a bookstore were the blocks.

38:26.289 --> 38:26.909
The blocks?

38:26.929 --> 38:27.990
You got the actual blocks?

38:28.010 --> 38:29.332
So I've got the blocks.

38:29.352 --> 38:29.592
Oh, nice.

38:29.652 --> 38:31.774
But two or three years later,

38:32.885 --> 38:34.927
We're talking about Captain January.

38:35.007 --> 38:36.749
That's Captain January.

38:37.650 --> 38:38.331
That is F.C.

38:38.611 --> 38:40.394
Merrill, M.E.R.

38:40.414 --> 38:40.974
I.O.

38:41.355 --> 38:41.555
Yeah.

38:41.655 --> 38:44.558
I'm sorry.

38:44.939 --> 38:46.100
He's wonderful.

38:46.420 --> 38:55.150
He, uh... I think her name is Rosebud or something marvelous.

38:55.190 --> 39:00.116
Oh, this is Sendak, the study for where the wild things are.

39:00.136 --> 39:00.276
Yeah.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.462
It's a watercolor, perhaps, though?

39:02.482 --> 39:05.185
That's... I forget what it is.

39:05.205 --> 39:07.488
Maybe it says on the back that they used it.

39:07.949 --> 39:09.751
Watercolor and ink on paper.

39:12.154 --> 39:12.294
Mm-hmm.

39:12.315 --> 39:12.475
You see?

39:12.495 --> 39:14.477
You can't see... And that's for where the wild things are.

39:14.497 --> 39:17.781
That's... Yes, that's... That's got to be many... quite a few years old.

39:18.402 --> 39:20.024
I don't think it's hanging on the... Sixty-nine.

39:20.084 --> 39:21.326
No, it isn't.

39:21.346 --> 39:21.887
There it is.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.589
Okay, there it is, yeah.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.172
I've got it now.

39:26.192 --> 39:30.077
That's Harrison Cady, who did Thornton Burgess...

39:30.698 --> 39:32.420
But you see the real diamond?

39:33.301 --> 39:35.423
Of course.

39:35.443 --> 39:40.327
This is, uh, one at the Groglia 100th, Little Lord Fauntleroy.

39:40.367 --> 39:42.269
And who's the artist for that?

39:42.409 --> 39:43.430
That's Birch.

39:44.331 --> 39:44.471
Uh-huh.

39:44.491 --> 39:47.414
And, and, uh... B-A-R-C-A.

39:47.514 --> 39:47.995
I forget.

39:48.075 --> 39:54.201
Somebody described, uh, I forget whose book it was, but there was a fan.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.883
The little boys would now have long hair.

39:56.963 --> 39:58.765
This was about 19...

40:00.500 --> 40:04.284
No, he was 18, probably 85, somewhere around in there.

40:05.605 --> 40:13.813
And I forget, somebody described it, but maybe it's in the Gloria thing, that every little boy's ready to throw up.

40:13.833 --> 40:18.057
He was mad that his mother made him look like that.

40:18.077 --> 40:19.719
That's Raggedy Ann and Andy.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.162
Now, is that the original art for the founding book?

40:23.282 --> 40:24.683
No, not for the book.

40:24.703 --> 40:25.744
It must have been done.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.366
I have two.

40:27.546 --> 40:29.528
One's signed, one isn't signed.

40:29.896 --> 40:33.279
It's a remarkable collection.

40:33.439 --> 40:37.884
It's not in the book, but it's one of.

40:38.624 --> 40:42.007
That's a poster advertising the Brownian.

40:42.027 --> 40:44.550
That's a syntax in the night kitchen.

40:46.031 --> 40:53.779
That's Shin, study for night before Christmas.

40:53.799 --> 40:57.422
Not used, but the book has the same...

40:57.487 --> 41:03.083
How do we spell Shin?

41:03.624 --> 41:05.069
S-H-I-N-N.

41:05.410 --> 41:06.793
S-H-I-N.

41:07.255 --> 41:07.716
Sorry.

41:08.455 --> 41:10.117
He was one of the eight.

41:10.138 --> 41:11.480
Do you remember that group?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.422
Oh, the eight.

41:13.543 --> 41:14.724
Oh, right.

41:16.647 --> 41:16.848
The eight.

41:16.868 --> 41:17.368
Oh, that's Shin.

41:17.388 --> 41:19.792
That's Shin.

41:21.014 --> 41:22.696
I'm not sure quite what that is.

41:22.997 --> 41:28.164
It's James Doherty, and I'm not sure if it's the lithograph or the sketch.

41:29.607 --> 41:34.153
I'm not good enough to know, but Abraham Lincoln and Sandberg.

41:34.213 --> 41:37.939
Doherty illustrated the sketch, I think, in a couple.

41:38.425 --> 41:40.027
This is Toby Tyler?

41:40.047 --> 41:41.549
You don't know Toby Tyler?

41:41.569 --> 41:41.629
No.

41:41.829 --> 41:42.711
Well, see, you're too old.

41:43.452 --> 41:48.218
This was, uh, every little boy thought this was great.

41:48.238 --> 41:50.661
You ran away and joined the circus.

41:50.681 --> 41:52.003
Of course, you're quite homesick.

41:53.024 --> 42:00.654
And, uh, uh, so Toby's making a friend with his friend.

42:00.874 --> 42:01.515
The monkey.

42:01.535 --> 42:02.116
The monkey.

42:02.617 --> 42:04.399
And, uh, so it's the story of

42:05.003 --> 42:12.936
The funny thing about this, I think, and I'm not sure, I've got to recount, because I think I've got every original.

42:12.976 --> 42:15.119
This is Rogers did them.

42:16.021 --> 42:27.339
And I think I have all the original drawings for this book, which is very popular in those days, except for one.

42:28.181 --> 42:32.007
And that was my brother's favorite book, and he was here one day.

42:33.050 --> 42:37.135
And I said, you know, I've got all ones from Toby Todd except for one.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.798
He said, guess who has the other?

42:40.300 --> 42:41.281
That's a cute story.

42:41.301 --> 42:45.927
So he gave it to his son, and I keep saying, do you think Wally would like to get rid of it?

42:46.688 --> 42:49.932
And I keep getting no answer, and I don't want to push him.

42:49.952 --> 42:54.799
This is Pyle for the chapter heading and one illustration.

42:55.119 --> 43:01.207
The great red fox calls upon the sausage, how three went out into the world.

43:01.227 --> 43:01.808
It's frustrating.

43:02.260 --> 43:03.261
Yeah, that's wonderful.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.263
Now, she's modern.

43:06.004 --> 43:10.368
But this is Edward Lear's... Edward Lear.

43:11.809 --> 43:16.714
The story was by Edward Lear, finished by Ogden Nash.

43:18.035 --> 43:22.800
And it's called... Do you want to know the name?

43:22.820 --> 43:22.920
Sure.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.101
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43:24.141 --> 43:29.466
But she's alive and well and lives in Wisconsin, and her name's Nancy Burgess.

43:29.986 --> 43:31.788
Oh, I know Nancy Birkin.

43:31.808 --> 43:32.108
Yeah.

43:32.128 --> 43:35.731
This is modern, but it's Bear Rabbit.

43:35.751 --> 43:36.992
Looks like Barry Moser.

43:37.252 --> 43:37.753
And it is.

43:38.313 --> 43:39.795
Yeah, with a good eye.

43:40.095 --> 43:46.020
And he's got the fox in the trunk, and he's about to pour in on the water.

43:46.260 --> 43:51.645
And I think it says his thinking machine is working.

43:52.586 --> 43:59.672
This is Kurt Weiss, and it's the all-American...

43:59.787 --> 44:00.888
baseball league.

44:02.250 --> 44:06.655
This I attribute to Maud Humphrey.

44:06.675 --> 44:15.665
She's the only one I know that's truly ultra-sweet children, and they're sort of her colors, and I think she did this.

44:15.685 --> 44:17.387
Maud, what's Maud, M-A-U-D?

44:17.647 --> 44:19.229
Maud Humphrey.

44:20.090 --> 44:29.220
And that's Reginald Denslow from The Wizard of Oz, and that's Scarecrow boiling the

44:29.673 --> 44:30.374
Tin Man.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.701
This is Otto.

44:36.622 --> 44:37.163
Oh, Otto.

44:37.303 --> 44:38.585
I know Otto.

44:38.605 --> 44:38.945
You know Otto?

44:38.965 --> 44:40.307
Yeah, he's got an Otto book, isn't he?

44:40.427 --> 44:44.993
Yeah, and too big to get on the book and so forth.

44:45.013 --> 44:46.395
This guy, I think, is great.

44:46.655 --> 44:48.317
I've got quite a few of his.

44:48.938 --> 44:53.564
His name was Mora, and it's for Renier the Fox.

44:55.447 --> 44:59.612
And they were done around 1900, and there's another one.

44:59.997 --> 45:02.901
one of the jobs out there.

45:02.921 --> 45:10.009
But I think just it's coming out of the, you know, it's poor out and so forth.

45:10.029 --> 45:11.191
They've got a lot of action.

45:12.732 --> 45:21.383
This is a takeoff on Kate Greenaway, which Auckland's pirated, and we copied.

45:23.966 --> 45:27.270
I think I've got the books for all of these.

45:28.381 --> 45:29.222
Yeah.

45:29.522 --> 45:29.882
Yeah.

45:29.902 --> 45:35.348
This is a study for Tom Sawyer and Huffington.

45:35.488 --> 45:40.072
I was going to say that, but I didn't want to say anything.

45:40.172 --> 45:40.272
Yeah.

45:40.292 --> 45:41.814
Where he says, what have you got there?

45:41.894 --> 45:43.255
And he says, a dead cat.

45:43.275 --> 45:46.338
And he says something about Jesus death or something.

45:46.358 --> 45:50.402
That's the little guy that's on the pictorial cloth of Tom Sawyer, I think.

45:51.443 --> 45:54.366
Well, the pictures in the book, it's slightly different.

45:54.406 --> 45:57.409
You can see, I forget, you can see his corncloth.

45:58.334 --> 46:03.460
caught pipe in the illustration that was used.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.663
And I think there's a handkerchief or something here.

46:05.743 --> 46:07.966
But it's just about the same.

46:08.046 --> 46:08.647
Wonderful.

46:09.027 --> 46:10.008
These are kind of fun.

46:10.028 --> 46:11.230
These are the color.

46:11.450 --> 46:12.812
You feel like the crazy?

46:12.832 --> 46:14.954
This was a flap book.

46:15.916 --> 46:19.240
And this flap, I've got the book, I'll show you.

46:19.340 --> 46:26.128
It comes to, I guess it must come to over here or somewhere.

46:26.288 --> 46:27.750
And then you open the flap.

46:28.102 --> 46:32.809
You know, it's like a transformation.

46:33.730 --> 46:43.423
This is the Sendak that... I just moved Eloise from here.

46:43.443 --> 46:51.315
This is the Sendak for The Hobbit, but it was never published because Sendak and Tolkien had a fight.

46:51.335 --> 46:55.520
Yeah, I didn't think he did The Hobbit.

46:56.261 --> 46:57.383
That's Parrish.

46:59.101 --> 47:01.864
I don't know what from.

47:01.904 --> 47:05.527
This is the ... I've always looked for this book.

47:05.607 --> 47:06.949
I've never found it.

47:06.969 --> 47:07.569
Good Night Moon.

47:07.629 --> 47:11.834
The proof ... proof for the dust jacket.

47:14.997 --> 47:15.657
Good Night Moon.

47:15.677 --> 47:17.039
By Clement Hurd.

47:17.459 --> 47:17.980
Good Night Moon.

47:18.180 --> 47:25.507
And when I had this exhibit at Yale, I think there must have been eight people who said, why don't you go?

47:25.567 --> 47:28.450
Good Night Moon.

47:28.683 --> 47:35.590
I had this by then, but it was too late to go up to Yale.

47:36.831 --> 47:41.536
And through a friend who's a cousin at Clement Heard, that was how I got it.

47:42.176 --> 47:45.820
And I talked to him, and I said, where's, do you have first edition?

47:45.860 --> 47:47.922
Could I possibly get one?

47:47.942 --> 47:49.764
He said, I don't think I've got one.

47:49.984 --> 47:50.765
It was published.

47:51.405 --> 47:52.587
It wasn't very popular.

47:52.607 --> 47:55.329
They republished, and it took off.

47:55.770 --> 47:58.032
But he said, I've got that.

47:58.113 --> 48:00.496
Original drawing by John Neal.

48:01.397 --> 48:03.620
Not John.

48:03.640 --> 48:04.040
Neal.

48:04.901 --> 48:06.183
For TikTok.

48:06.403 --> 48:09.707
This is Goops.

48:10.488 --> 48:13.973
Do you know the Goops?

48:13.993 --> 48:14.774
No.

48:14.794 --> 48:18.919
Well, that's Gillette Burgess and the Goops.

48:18.939 --> 48:21.762
I think the Goops are still republished.

48:22.664 --> 48:25.828
There was a Burgess book that just came out about three years ago, as a matter of fact.

48:25.848 --> 48:27.850
I think they redid it during that.

48:28.673 --> 48:31.799
And here's a poster of advertising it.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.422
This is a key.

48:33.502 --> 48:36.608
This is English, but you have to load it.

48:36.628 --> 48:36.848
I couldn't.

48:37.890 --> 48:40.735
This is Lear.

48:42.058 --> 48:45.724
And it says here, my dear Mrs. Digby.

48:45.744 --> 48:46.486
Oh, that's funny.

48:46.586 --> 48:50.513
So sorry that... It's to say yes, he'd like to come for tea.

48:50.898 --> 48:52.640
We're getting her away.

48:52.941 --> 48:54.202
Paper, something, something.

48:54.503 --> 48:57.447
And it says, the Grazzi softened.

48:57.607 --> 48:58.608
The Grazzi.

48:59.029 --> 49:01.572
Yeah, December 4th.

49:01.592 --> 49:02.333
1868.

49:02.794 --> 49:04.376
And that is where we stand?

49:04.416 --> 49:05.157
Yeah.

49:05.778 --> 49:06.619
So that's great.

49:06.960 --> 49:07.560
That's great.

49:09.683 --> 49:16.693
Let's see, this guy that I can't find out anything about, but his name is Hochstein, and I love his things.

49:16.713 --> 49:19.977
I just can't find out anything about him.

49:20.412 --> 49:30.901
And this is Parish for Irving's, uh, Knickerbocker, uh, you know, History of New York.

49:30.941 --> 49:31.261
Sure.

49:34.644 --> 49:34.865
Famous.

49:34.885 --> 49:42.932
And, let's see, around the corner here we have, we have, uh... It's a Winslow Homer.

49:42.992 --> 49:50.318
Yeah, that's, uh... This, again, will be Tyler.

49:52.087 --> 49:57.234
This is the one that precedes the great painting, I believe you said.

49:57.254 --> 49:57.595
Does it?

49:58.036 --> 50:01.180
No, it must be taken from the painting.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.021
You'd be surprised.

50:02.081 --> 50:06.408
In many cases, like the Harper's Weekly, things precede the painting books.

50:06.428 --> 50:07.910
No, no, I don't know.

50:08.370 --> 50:10.053
I'll find out for you.

50:10.073 --> 50:11.154
It doesn't have a date.

50:11.715 --> 50:13.137
It's wonderful.

50:13.157 --> 50:19.326
The girl's mother gave it to him when he graduated from college, I guess.

50:20.993 --> 50:26.160
But from that date, I know it's one of the original first etchings.

50:26.180 --> 50:27.162
I know that much.

50:27.843 --> 50:28.924
But I don't know the last.

50:30.326 --> 50:34.191
And the original, I guess he got it when he graduated from Andover.

50:35.373 --> 50:37.376
Because the original painting was Andover.

50:38.277 --> 50:39.258
Did Homer sign these?

50:39.959 --> 50:41.982
No, but he did that.

50:42.042 --> 50:47.910
Again, I've got something I can look up to try and tell you what.

50:48.311 --> 50:49.853
I'm just really excited about it.

50:50.592 --> 50:55.737
The, uh, this is an uncut sheet for something called... Oh, yeah.

50:55.757 --> 50:56.197
Oh, yeah.

50:56.217 --> 51:02.202
The Path of Learning Strewed with Flowers, which was an English book.

51:02.282 --> 51:03.063
That's famous.

51:03.564 --> 51:03.784
Yes.

51:03.804 --> 51:07.087
They had that at the Morgan Show last year, I think.

51:07.307 --> 51:08.728
The same, an uncut sheet?

51:09.389 --> 51:12.031
I don't know if it was an uncut sheet.

51:12.051 --> 51:12.171
Yeah.

51:12.251 --> 51:13.853
And it was republished here.

51:14.113 --> 51:18.557
And, of course, they had, like, a whole bunch of school kids and

51:18.993 --> 51:26.022
You did blue, and I did yellow, and you, you have to be a girl who did brown, you know, and that's the way they colored.

51:26.042 --> 51:27.604
That's Toby Todd again.

51:28.566 --> 51:30.949
That's the more that you've seen.

51:31.730 --> 51:37.778
This is Den's love endpapers for Mother Goose.

51:38.559 --> 51:39.260
Oh, boy.

51:40.181 --> 51:41.443
That's he signed a D-E-N.

51:41.463 --> 51:41.683
Yeah.

51:41.863 --> 51:42.784
Yeah, there he is.

51:43.926 --> 51:46.249
With a sort of keyhole.

51:46.583 --> 51:48.185
Poseidon there, whatever you call it.

51:48.225 --> 51:50.528
This is Benelman's Madeline.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.309
Oh, yeah.

51:51.329 --> 51:53.111
Which Madeline's in the hospital.

51:53.391 --> 51:55.054
She's had her appendix.

51:55.414 --> 52:04.105
That she really shouldn't look at, but they, uh... I love these.

52:04.626 --> 52:05.747
Are you kidding?

52:06.047 --> 52:07.369
We're at home now.

52:07.569 --> 52:09.632
Isn't it awful?

52:10.132 --> 52:12.095
Well, those are just for the blocks.

52:12.575 --> 52:13.857
There's two up there.

52:14.680 --> 52:23.507
The two underneath are for, uh, uh, they're after George Cruikshank, and it's the Queen of Hearts.

52:23.527 --> 52:24.188
Yeah.

52:24.208 --> 52:27.151
A McLaughlin thing.

52:27.171 --> 52:30.393
All of these... Oh, that was, that was New York Public Library.

52:30.413 --> 52:31.294
There it is, Nick Doodle.

52:31.634 --> 52:32.035
Yeah.

52:32.275 --> 52:36.358
And it's from Witches to Wonderland, with a dash, Wonderland.

52:37.119 --> 52:42.443
American children's book, 1692-1947, and that was your... That was it, yeah.

52:42.484 --> 52:44.265
The Witches, uh,

52:44.600 --> 52:47.183
I was sort of a cheat, but I couldn't resist it.

52:47.203 --> 52:57.573
The witches were the ones that said there were witches, were children.

52:58.353 --> 53:10.405
So that was it, and I have an indenture for the arrest of Mary English, because she— That's just a witch child.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.005
Two, is it, or 1690?

53:13.025 --> 53:16.312
Well, it's two, because they're having their 300th anniversary this year.

53:16.332 --> 53:23.948
Yeah, that was it then, and it's an indenture for the arrest of Mary English for what you see in the catalog.

53:24.690 --> 53:27.696
This is where all the work... You do all your own work.

53:28.137 --> 53:28.478
Yeah.

53:28.610 --> 53:29.952
That must be fun.

53:29.972 --> 53:31.974
Is that where the... Oh, I enjoy it at no end.

53:31.994 --> 53:34.497
I'll never in my lifetime get caught up.

53:34.517 --> 53:36.780
So you know the collection quite... I know.

53:36.800 --> 53:42.246
Is that a collection... That's the only way I'd know it, you know, is because I do it.

53:43.067 --> 53:49.995
That's a poster for The Lark, which was Gillette Burgess, a poster advertising St.

53:50.055 --> 53:52.378
Nicholas, and that's a poster for Father Goose.

53:53.299 --> 53:54.000
His book.

53:54.080 --> 53:56.102
His book.

53:56.774 --> 54:01.018
And here's another poster for Father Goose's book.

54:01.038 --> 54:03.320
Denslow and Denslow, of course.

54:05.422 --> 54:07.144
This is your study.

54:07.164 --> 54:07.464
Yes.

54:07.744 --> 54:08.084
Yeah.

54:08.124 --> 54:09.225
You want to call it that?

54:09.245 --> 54:12.308
That sounds pretty nice.

54:12.328 --> 54:12.769
Very nice.

54:13.830 --> 54:18.234
I see you work with your back to the panorama, because it's almost impossible to do work.

54:18.254 --> 54:18.674
Oh, yeah.

54:18.694 --> 54:19.715
That looks nice.

54:19.875 --> 54:25.060
I'd straighten that out, because I thought you might be up here.

54:25.597 --> 54:28.620
So, anyway, somehow or other I get there.

54:30.722 --> 54:31.623
Oh, yeah.

54:31.843 --> 54:33.645
I'll have to show you downstairs.

54:33.665 --> 54:34.826
Tell us a little bit about the family.

54:34.846 --> 54:36.728
You have how many grandchildren?

54:36.808 --> 54:37.789
Six grandchildren.

54:38.249 --> 54:43.735
I'll show you pictures downstairs just to show off.

54:43.755 --> 54:45.857
But that, you know, I told you about files.

54:45.957 --> 54:48.960
This is, uh, these are authors.

54:49.821 --> 54:51.182
These are publishers.

54:51.938 --> 54:54.846
This describes the book.

54:54.866 --> 54:56.911
Well, this is a pretty extensive collection.

54:57.613 --> 55:00.280
And these are prints that I don't, they have no room at all.

55:00.300 --> 55:01.604
This is the one I forgot.

55:01.624 --> 55:04.311
This is the title, and these are the illustrations.
