00:03.102 --> 00:04.364
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

00:04.384 --> 00:07.028
By structure, I mean even a classical idea.

00:07.548 --> 00:19.065
Aristotle says that every drama moves from a condition with which it begins to its reversal by the end.

00:20.828 --> 00:29.380
And when I saw that this story would begin with my first mass and end with my father's funeral mass,

00:30.845 --> 00:33.809
and so much would have been reversed by the end.

00:33.829 --> 00:44.886
My father in his prime, a man of power, having been declined almost biblically into a shell of himself and finally dead.

00:45.527 --> 00:54.901
My being at the center of the ritual as the newly ordained priest to being kind of marginal to the ritual as a man on the margin of the church.

00:57.004 --> 00:58.827
My being a son

00:59.819 --> 01:01.201
to my being a father.

01:01.221 --> 01:18.401
I mean, all these reversals, the way in which so many things were reversed from that first scene to the last scene, when I began to get a feel for that, then I saw the arc of the story and it enabled me to go through it.

01:20.404 --> 01:23.247
And then the chapters fell open before me.

01:23.267 --> 01:28.273
The FBI is one chapter, my religious education,

01:30.380 --> 01:34.524
Well, my experience of the popes is another chapter.

01:34.564 --> 01:36.606
My religious education is another chapter.

01:37.126 --> 01:39.388
Civil rights is another chapter.

01:39.448 --> 01:41.650
Vietnam is another chapter.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.353
And then my priesthood itself is another chapter.

01:44.433 --> 01:52.240
Well, you know, when you think of priests, typically, you think, oh, poor priests, they haven't really experienced anything.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.801
They just live this sheltered life.

01:54.602 --> 01:57.805
But you talk about living through these mental times and having experience.

01:58.105 --> 01:58.926
Right, that's true.

01:59.226 --> 02:01.670
You're talking about dating Linda Bird Johnson.

02:01.690 --> 02:01.930
Right.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.532
That's just got a couple of throwaway lines.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.154
How did that come about?

02:05.875 --> 02:10.922
Well, she was friends with a guy who was the son.

02:10.942 --> 02:19.693
General Parikh Cabell was the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Alan Dulles.

02:19.713 --> 02:22.657
And he lived two or three doors down from us on General's Row.

02:23.238 --> 02:27.724
And his son, Ben Cabell, whom I knew at Georgetown,

02:29.138 --> 02:39.835
and who I knew from the base, was a sophisticated, urbane, well-connected, young prince of Washington.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.157
That was the feeling he gave me.

02:41.177 --> 02:42.419
He was a very elegant guy.

02:43.241 --> 02:44.182
And he knew Lindeberg.

02:44.943 --> 02:46.806
He was part of that circle, and he brought me into it.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.311
That's how it happened.

02:49.471 --> 02:50.072
On the S.S.

02:50.392 --> 02:51.294
Sequoia.

02:51.654 --> 02:52.996
Right.

02:53.016 --> 02:54.539
Great little story.

02:54.559 --> 02:56.462
You talk about the times

02:56.763 --> 02:59.448
They really were.

03:02.234 --> 03:10.010
Incredible times.

03:10.050 --> 03:14.258
Let's say that the book hadn't sold it.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.687
What were some of the options?

03:20.405 --> 03:21.947
Well, I was free as a bird.

03:22.248 --> 03:27.476
By the time I left the priesthood, I was cut loose on the world.

03:27.576 --> 03:29.679
I had optimism, I was freedom.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.443
I had no money, and I had no need for it.

03:33.906 --> 03:35.929
I was absolutely a free man.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.092
It was a wonderful period of my life.

03:38.232 --> 03:47.366
If I hadn't been able to find a way to live as a writer, I think I probably, I don't know, maybe I would have gone back to school and gotten a degree in history.

03:47.426 --> 03:47.847
I don't know.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.451
become a teacher.

03:49.511 --> 03:50.212
I love teaching.

03:51.034 --> 03:53.117
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

03:53.918 --> 04:00.128
As it happened, writing was... I fell into writing.

04:00.248 --> 04:01.751
Apollos encouraged me to do it.

04:01.891 --> 04:04.495
I loved writing sermons.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.438
I loved telling the stories of the Gospel.

04:07.220 --> 04:12.528
When I was a preacher, all I ever wanted to do as a preacher was make people understand how great these stories are.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.673
The story of Jesus, the story of Moses,

04:16.092 --> 04:17.814
This week, the story of Passover.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.516
I mean, these great stories, you know.

04:19.576 --> 04:20.637
Have you saved the family?

04:20.657 --> 04:20.858
No.

04:21.258 --> 04:22.480
I never wrote them.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.181
Oh, really?

04:24.582 --> 04:26.064
I always just told them.

04:26.805 --> 04:35.335
And, I mean, it appalls me now to think of how cavalier I was about it, you know.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.881
So let's talk about this gift of stuff.

04:39.901 --> 04:45.247
I think it's really kind of like two hours.

04:45.267 --> 04:45.628
Yeah.

04:45.648 --> 04:46.048
Yeah, sure.

04:46.467 --> 04:52.676
Do you think this gift of storytelling has anything to do with your Irish story?

04:52.696 --> 04:59.605
Well, I think I refer somewhere in this book to the powerful impression my mother made on me as a storyteller.

05:00.607 --> 05:04.232
Taking us around in Washington and telling the stories of Washington.

05:04.252 --> 05:09.860
And I... Right.

05:10.220 --> 05:12.584
At which point she became different.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.107
But, you know, when I think of what I did...

05:16.201 --> 05:22.029
For example, pulling together the stories of Boston when I was really getting my head into the novel of Mortal Friends.

05:22.429 --> 05:26.975
It was a version of what she had done for me, with me, when I was a very young boy.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.358
There's the Carol Arms Hotel.

05:29.438 --> 05:40.613
I remember vividly her telling me a story about my father doing a surveillance on a German spy in the Carol Arms Hotel, where he was in one room and the spy was in another room.

05:42.015 --> 05:45.499
Whether it was really a spy, who knows, but somebody the FBI was tracking anyway.

05:45.901 --> 05:52.032
And my father, she told me my father, you know, in this room, listening to what the man was doing in the next room.

05:52.072 --> 05:53.134
And I still remember that.

05:53.735 --> 06:02.170
And I don't go to Washington to this day without my imagination going to the Carol Arms Hotel, even though the building was demolished years ago.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.953
It was on Capitol Hill near the Capitol.

06:04.895 --> 06:08.301
And it made an impression on me, of course, because it was my name also, the Carol Arms.

06:08.742 --> 06:10.525
Mark Russell, the humorist.

06:10.994 --> 06:15.541
began his career in the bar at the Carol Arms Hotel, where I used to go.

06:15.601 --> 06:19.207
Yeah, then he moved to the Shoreham, but before he was at the Shoreham, he was at the Carol Arms.

06:19.667 --> 06:24.054
And I used to go there when I was a college kid, to the Carol Arms, to listen to Mark Russell.

06:26.317 --> 06:33.328
So, you know, the stories my mother told, I think, was a powerful impact, made a powerful impression on me.

06:33.348 --> 06:39.598
I don't think Pat Conway was the first storyteller, the first novelist he ever knew, that I would never learn a novel, but he was a storyteller.

06:39.618 --> 06:39.718
Yeah.

06:40.728 --> 06:44.733
They were all pictures.

06:44.753 --> 06:49.880
They were so beautiful, you know.

06:50.340 --> 06:56.328
Okay, and then I guess, what's the works in progress, thoughts?

06:56.348 --> 07:04.859
I'm in the middle of a novel I've been working on for a long time, which is, I don't know how to describe it, so I better not.

07:06.081 --> 07:08.524
But it's a novel, yeah.

07:08.656 --> 07:20.298
You described sending your brother's copies of the manuscript and saying also, if you read all it, it doesn't go.

07:20.318 --> 07:24.145
So I would conclude from that that the book was not under contract at that point.

07:24.165 --> 07:27.832
Did you write this kind of as an exercise?

07:29.414 --> 07:31.879
The book was under contract.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.460
I don't know how I would have dealt with that.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.782
So you did write it?

07:36.122 --> 07:36.443
I did.

07:37.144 --> 07:38.205
I did, yeah.

07:38.425 --> 07:38.746
I did.

07:39.106 --> 07:41.069
Was it a proposal?

07:42.411 --> 07:42.651
Yes.

07:43.151 --> 07:44.073
Well, it wasn't a proposal.

07:44.093 --> 07:56.669
It was a sort of... I'd given a talk about my father and myself, and it was maybe 30 pages long, and I'd written it up.

07:56.689 --> 07:59.993
I used that, and I gave that talk.

08:01.137 --> 08:14.249
We're meeting today on Wednesday, which happens to be the Wednesday that falls between Palm Sunday and Easter.

08:14.810 --> 08:26.100
It's Passover, but in the old Catholic tradition, it's called Spy Wednesday, because this is the day, Wednesday of Holy Week, when Judas betrayed Jesus.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.261
Dropped the dime.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.203
Literally dropped the dime.

08:29.673 --> 08:36.443
But boy, isn't that interesting when we're talking about family traits?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.164
It's true.

08:37.865 --> 08:38.986
Let me also add one thing.

08:39.006 --> 08:55.470
I wanted to emphasize, and to the extent that it's relevant when you're talking about the editorial process, that my editor, Wendy Strothman, really played a key role in my doing this.

08:55.630 --> 08:59.055
She heard that talk I gave.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.869
And you gave the talk where, once again?

09:00.889 --> 09:05.754
I gave the talk at the Examiner's Club in Boston, which is a small... And she happened to be there?

09:05.774 --> 09:08.616
And she's a member, and she's... She's based in Boston?

09:08.777 --> 09:09.297
Yes, she is.

09:09.497 --> 09:11.039
So that's part two of us.

09:11.079 --> 09:12.660
So many of the writers are in New York.

09:13.000 --> 09:13.521
Right.

09:13.541 --> 09:29.295
And she really affirmed the idea of the story as a book, and she really gave me some important support, personal support in the writing of it.

09:29.647 --> 09:32.252
I mean, she's a fine entertainer.

09:32.272 --> 09:37.542
Was she there just mainly to hear the talk or to consider it as a possibility?

09:37.562 --> 09:41.409
No, no, no, she was just there to hear the talk, yeah.

09:41.429 --> 09:43.132
And did she propose the idea?

09:43.172 --> 09:52.009
No, but she, you know, I knew that I would be at some point writing a book.

09:53.120 --> 10:04.191
full version of this story, and she just made it very clear that she thought it would be a valuable story, and she wanted to publish it, and so I'm grateful to her.

10:04.211 --> 10:21.507
I'm holding a volume titled Poems by Alan Tate, and it's inscribed in the first front case down here, inscribed to James Carroll with all good wishes for his two vocations, Alan Tate, April 12th, 1966, and this is

10:22.769 --> 10:23.690
You see the puppy.

10:23.710 --> 10:27.734
It's 1960, Charles Spirits.

10:27.754 --> 10:31.678
You should put a little... I know, I should.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.440
Would you?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.821
We should really protect that.

10:34.961 --> 10:35.722
It sure is, yeah.

10:35.822 --> 10:42.209
That's quite a wonderful... I noticed you're reading the old dial here.

10:42.229 --> 10:47.494
To occasion, I'd like to shoot a couple of pictures.
