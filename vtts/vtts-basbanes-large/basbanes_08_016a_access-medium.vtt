00:02.613 --> 00:18.134
Well, tell me about the formidable task of writing a biography of Abraham Lincoln.

00:18.175 --> 00:21.559
It must have been daunting.

00:21.579 --> 00:24.143
It's like writing a new life of Shakespeare, almost, isn't it?

00:24.603 --> 00:25.785
I suppose it is, though, of course.

00:26.052 --> 00:28.554
one only writes one sentence at a time.

00:28.594 --> 00:30.296
You know that as well as I do.

00:30.316 --> 00:40.285
So it isn't just when you say, I'm going to write 800 pages about Abraham Lincoln, you start on a much more modest scale of seeing what it is that you want to say.

00:42.367 --> 00:53.798
I came to this project in effect almost by a series of circumstances that were shepherded me in that direction.

00:55.465 --> 01:04.457
As I think you already know, I started in the history business with Professor James G. Randall at the University of Illinois, the great Lincoln scholar of that generation.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.943
And he was finishing his four-volume, Lincoln the President.

01:09.424 --> 01:14.851
I was fortunate enough to be his research assistant during some of that time, so I learned my trade there.

01:15.612 --> 01:19.397
Carl Sandberg had just finished his six volumes of Lincoln.

01:20.098 --> 01:25.185
Beveridge, alas, didn't live to finish his, but he had two enormous volumes.

01:25.655 --> 01:26.036
and so on.

01:26.376 --> 01:35.629
So Alan Evans was writing his War for the Union, Ordeal of the Union, and it was clearly going to be the massive study.

01:36.451 --> 01:40.456
And so I thought to myself as a very young man, this is something I'd better stay away from.

01:41.638 --> 01:49.289
I'm a little hand caught on the main line of the All-North Central Railroad, and all of these big trains are going through.

01:49.570 --> 01:53.215
Let me sort of stick on some sidetracks, which is

01:53.617 --> 01:55.560
substantially what I did.

01:55.600 --> 02:04.673
That is, I have written a good deal about Lincoln in more or less peripheral fashion, and about the Civil War.

02:05.334 --> 02:15.910
But I always stayed away from the main subject, writing about Lincoln's law partner, about Charles Sumner, who was associated with him, about Selman B. Chase, who was the Secretary of the Treasurer, and so on.

02:16.330 --> 02:20.396
A kind of a periphery of Lincoln's stuff, I guess.

02:22.099 --> 02:23.100
All right.

02:23.755 --> 02:27.019
Then there came certain kinds of realizations.

02:27.079 --> 02:43.757
One, that I probably had time for one more large book project, while I'm more or less, mostly less, I think, in command of my faculties, and so I would think what I wanted to do.

02:44.558 --> 02:53.728
Second, that with all these years, I really was not very happy with the books and biographies that do exist,

02:54.890 --> 03:11.048
All of them have decided merits, and yet they did not seem to be, in that kind of stupid way of saying, up to date in terms of the sources, or more important, I think, in terms of the questions they asked and were thinking about.

03:11.068 --> 03:21.720
And I just didn't find that most people that I knew, including the students I taught all those years at Harvard, were reading anything about Lincoln.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.323
They didn't have time to read these

03:24.809 --> 03:28.414
Carl Sandberg said he wrote more than a million words about Lincoln.

03:29.416 --> 03:32.180
Mr. Randall's books are out of print.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.023
Beverage is out of print.

03:34.043 --> 03:38.249
Nicolet and Hay you can find maybe in rare bookstores or book shops.

03:39.190 --> 03:41.494
And I don't think people were reading about Lincoln.

03:41.834 --> 03:52.470
So I thought there ought to be a life that modern students and modern grown-ups could read about Lincoln to learn about the war and about this man.

03:52.822 --> 03:55.525
So that is sort of one set of circumstances.

03:55.585 --> 03:58.629
The other is much more personal, I think.

04:00.431 --> 04:06.598
I don't really take myself all that seriously as a historian or anything else.

04:06.638 --> 04:09.562
It's a job that I work at and try to do the best I can.

04:12.085 --> 04:22.457
But after people were good enough to give me one Pulitzer Prize for the Sumner book, and then very unexpectedly a second one for the Wolf book,

04:23.669 --> 04:35.742
I began to have, and this shows some monomania and paranoia and grandiose ideas, so I began to think, you know, there are some people out there who think that maybe I'm fairly good at this business.

04:36.863 --> 04:49.356
And so, the combination of wanting a new project, the inadequacy as I saw it of the present literature, and the feeling that there were a number of people who thought maybe I could do this.

04:49.758 --> 04:55.427
All these converge to make me say, okay, I think I will try this for a big project.

04:56.449 --> 05:00.435
So for the past seven and a half years, I have done very little else.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.619
I've done almost no reviewing.

05:02.739 --> 05:04.722
I've written almost no articles.

05:05.704 --> 05:08.829
I have not revised textbooks or anything.

05:08.849 --> 05:10.872
It's been all this straight through.

05:11.088 --> 05:14.672
You mentioned that Sandberg did a million words on Lincoln.

05:14.692 --> 05:19.436
What were some of the inadequacies, and not just of his life, but of some of the others?

05:20.257 --> 05:30.467
Well, for Sandberg, in particular, as you know, is a wonderful, rich, juicy, personal, human portrait of Lincoln.

05:30.487 --> 05:36.353
There's a disadvantage that Sandberg was not, and he didn't claim to be, he was not a trained historian.

05:36.433 --> 05:39.576
He had no

05:39.860 --> 05:50.232
sense of testing evidence as to what could be true and what is true and what might be false and what is false.

05:50.252 --> 06:00.124
To be honest about it, Carl, whom I knew and loved, Carl thought anything in print was equally reliable.

06:00.785 --> 06:09.816
If you've ever been to, what is he called, a place down in North Carolina where he spent his last years, you will see in his study

06:10.859 --> 06:18.866
He had all around there things stuck up with thumbtacks, just clipped from anywhere.

06:19.347 --> 06:21.489
It didn't matter to him much where they came from.

06:21.909 --> 06:24.531
If it was a story that was a good story, he would put it in.

06:24.571 --> 06:25.452
He's a storyteller.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.513
He's a storyteller.

06:26.533 --> 06:26.833
That's right.

06:26.913 --> 06:32.519
He was a poet and he got at the thought of maybe the essential, the heart of it.

06:33.499 --> 06:40.866
But I wouldn't go to Sandberg's Lincoln to test any particular fact or interpretation or incident.

06:41.521 --> 06:45.228
because it might be quite sound.

06:45.749 --> 06:51.059
It might, at the end, be from belated recollections that people had made up.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.427
It was all just one thing at the end.

06:55.447 --> 07:02.280
Not, indeed, until after these books were published, it called Ever Look At Manuscript materials, unpublished materials.

07:02.632 --> 07:06.195
So he relied largely on secondary sources?

07:06.576 --> 07:09.419
Well, not quite that old printed sources.

07:10.019 --> 07:18.047
He relied on newspapers, on old magazines, on other biographies, on biographies of other people, life's letters, and so on.

07:19.328 --> 07:24.153
And essentially was weaving a beautiful tapestry, and it is a marvelous tapestry.

07:24.173 --> 07:28.437
I don't think anybody else could do that or would want to do that.

07:29.480 --> 07:36.507
But, again, I don't think it's a place you go to ask, well, what kind of a president did Lincoln make?

07:36.987 --> 07:40.751
What was President Lincoln's role in the Republican Party?

07:40.831 --> 07:41.972
That sort of thing.

07:42.512 --> 07:49.119
So, was one of your tasks to challenge some of what you perceived to be the apocrypha?

07:49.599 --> 07:52.662
Well, I decided I would not go about it that way.

07:53.343 --> 07:58.828
And, you know, that's a perfectly legitimate way of doing it, that is, basically writing a book that

07:58.943 --> 08:03.070
would, to some extent, mop up after all the other people.

08:04.012 --> 08:13.649
And I suppose maybe there ought to be a book, there ought to be a book long after print, a big book called Legends That Libel Lincoln, which is what it's called.

08:14.009 --> 08:18.437
In other words, saying this isn't true because of these reasons, and this isn't true for these reasons.

08:19.447 --> 08:25.516
I decided, first of all, I don't think most people care about this kind of argument among historians.

08:25.676 --> 08:45.707
Professor A says that he thinks that Lincoln ordered the Sumter expedition to sail on April 6, 1861, but Professor B says he has some evidence that he gave informal orders that it should sail on April 4, 1861.

08:46.177 --> 08:53.407
And so they've both written books about this, and then there are articles about their books, and they all disagree, and then somebody else disagrees.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.730
So I don't think most people care about it.

08:55.750 --> 09:06.405
Well, these are factual assertions, but I'm thinking in terms of character, in terms of some of the conceptions that people might have of this character.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.306
You're right.

09:07.627 --> 09:11.492
Well, again, I just simply thought the best way of doing this was not.

09:11.810 --> 09:20.983
to say, okay, here are some stereotypes and I'm going to challenge them and see what I can do with them.

09:21.003 --> 09:29.274
I decided I was going to try to write, literally try to write, as though no biography of Abraham Lincoln had ever yet been written.

09:29.294 --> 09:32.098
And as you point out, you absolutely shielded yourself.

09:32.118 --> 09:35.543
Even though you'd read these earlier works, you didn't refer to them at all.

09:36.003 --> 09:40.129
I did not, particularly my two most immediate predecessors,

09:40.362 --> 09:49.111
Ben Thomas' Lincoln, which is a fine book, I loved it, and Stephen Oates' Larger, Warlock.

09:49.491 --> 09:51.173
And they're both fine books.

09:51.213 --> 09:52.254
I'm just going to take a look at them.

09:52.274 --> 09:54.437
You just keep talking now.

09:54.757 --> 09:56.639
Murphy's Law, it's just not a course.

09:56.659 --> 09:59.182
Things go wrong if they can't.

10:00.563 --> 10:07.871
I decided I would try it as though nobody had ever written a life of Lincoln.

10:08.451 --> 10:09.272
I was going to work

10:09.556 --> 10:36.424
from his papers, meaning the letters and documents he received, from what he wrote, which has now been fully published, everything that he wrote has been published, and from the letters and papers of his contemporaries, from contemporary newspapers, and simply, in effect, say, okay, nobody's ever written about this subject before, this is what it is.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.694
There's some disadvantages to that, I know.

10:39.714 --> 10:51.589
And every now and then I have let myself go in a footnote where it seemed to me it was necessary to say, I don't agree with this way of looking at so-and-so.

10:51.609 --> 11:04.926
But on the whole, I tried to stay away from that and simply to try to tell what I think is a fascinating story that has not been told in this particular way before.

11:05.125 --> 11:16.615
unencumbered by the kind of historian's jargon of Professor A, refused Professor B, refused Professor C, and so forth and so on.

11:16.635 --> 11:22.920
When you start like this, do you start with any axioms, any preconceptions?

11:23.440 --> 11:24.642
What kind of baggage do you want?

11:24.662 --> 11:34.710
One does necessarily, because after all, I've been at work in this Civil War Lincoln field practically all of my life.

11:35.146 --> 11:43.597
The first book, which of course took several years to prepare, was published in 1948, believe it or not, when I was only 28 years old.

11:43.938 --> 11:47.683
And so ever since then I've been off and on working in this field.

11:47.903 --> 12:04.765
So one can't help having some initial preconceptions, some initial feelings, but I tried as hard as I could to say, okay, I'm not going to talk about what I have said or anybody else has said about Herndon, about Sumner, about Chase, about any of the rest of these people.

12:05.470 --> 12:10.314
I'm going to try to see what Lincoln thought about them and what he knew.

12:10.374 --> 12:15.980
That little anecdote that I told at the very beginning is a quite true one.

12:16.400 --> 12:31.114
That is, years ago, when President Kennedy was kind enough to ask me to lecture on Lincoln in the White House, and I gave a little talk, and it was well received, I think, and we had some conversation afterward.

12:31.714 --> 12:34.937
He was, fuck him, he was really very upset.

12:35.272 --> 12:39.756
because a group of historians had been in to see him the previous day, and I wasn't one of them.

12:40.256 --> 12:44.079
They were conducting a poll on the American president.

12:44.440 --> 12:49.304
Who were the great ones, who were the near great, the average, the below average, the failures.

12:50.185 --> 12:58.552
And no doubt thinking about how he was going to stand in the backward glance of history, Kennedy was furious.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.093
He said, you can't do this.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.114
He was telling me this.

13:01.134 --> 13:03.316
He was very polite with them.

13:03.336 --> 13:04.857
You can't do this, he said.

13:05.090 --> 13:14.480
Nobody has a right to evaluate an American president like that, unless he sat in this chair, and he pointed to his chair.

13:15.141 --> 13:27.915
He sat in his chair, sees the kind of mail information that goes across his desk, learns to see the problems as he saw them, and then learns to make the decisions that he had to make.

13:27.955 --> 13:29.657
That's the only way you can do it.

13:29.958 --> 13:34.843
Not even, he said, poor James Buchanan has a right to be judged if they're in your failure.

13:35.245 --> 13:36.987
unless you've done this already.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.350
Well, that stayed with me, you know.

13:39.430 --> 13:56.749
It was a long time, but in the back of my mind there was always that feeling that I would like to sit at Lincoln's side and just simply see how he felt, how he acted, what he knew, why he decided to do this, and as best I could, how he felt as he was going on.

13:57.770 --> 14:03.396
I thought I could do this best, as I say, without the usual apparatus of

14:03.680 --> 14:18.257
As far as the Sumter Crisis is concerned, some people have said A, and some people have said B, and some people have said C, but I'm going to tell you that the real scoop is this.

14:18.277 --> 14:19.199
I didn't want to do that.

14:19.499 --> 14:22.282
I tried not.

14:23.784 --> 14:32.995
You also mentioned that so much material was made available that you saw material that had never, amazingly enough, even more than a century after his death,

14:33.498 --> 14:34.880
How much material is that?

14:34.900 --> 14:36.322
It keeps showing up.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.764
It is remarkable.

14:38.025 --> 14:42.031
A number of things were available to me that I think no other biographer had.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.254
Let's just look for a minute.

14:44.274 --> 14:49.542
Ben Thomas's excellent book was written before the collected works of Abraham Lincoln.

14:49.843 --> 14:58.476
Those, the gray volumes up there, the nine of them plus two small supplements, they had not appeared.

14:58.945 --> 15:07.053
And so he had to use necessarily defective earlier editions and incomplete editions of what Lincoln wrote, what he said.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.175
They were not mostly annotated.

15:09.195 --> 15:14.019
He didn't always know to whom they were writing, why they were writing, or what was written to him.

15:14.940 --> 15:22.047
He also wrote before there was a real chance to have available the Abraham Lincoln papers in the Library of Congress.

15:22.767 --> 15:28.733
Those papers were sealed by Robert Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's only surviving son.

15:29.725 --> 15:33.392
The story is somewhat amusing, I think.

15:33.412 --> 15:41.567
Robert Todd Lincoln was a rather stiff, somewhat self-importer, but man very loyal to his father and his family.

15:41.587 --> 15:52.948
Albert J. Beveridge, the senator from Indiana who had written excellent, probably still the best, Life of John Marshall, decided he was going to write a biography of Abraham Lincoln.

15:54.363 --> 16:08.262
Along the way, he got in touch with the man who then owned the papers of William H. Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, who had written what was considered a hostile derogatory biography.

16:08.282 --> 16:16.133
Well, when Robert Todd Lincoln heard that Debridge was going to use those papers, he vowed that he should never use his father's papers.

16:16.153 --> 16:17.795
So he gave them to the Library of Congress.

16:18.156 --> 16:20.539
He actually, so I am told, had

16:20.941 --> 16:26.669
an accountant or actuary looking into Beveridge's age and what his life expectancy would be.

16:26.689 --> 16:30.313
He figured out that he would add some years onto that.

16:30.514 --> 16:34.018
He sealed the papers, absolute seal for 50 years.

16:34.619 --> 16:38.204
Well, Beveridge died young as it happened, so he wouldn't have gotten much out of it anyway.

16:38.744 --> 16:40.667
But they were sealed to all historians.

16:41.368 --> 16:47.556
Professor Randall, for example, great scholar that he was, had no access to those papers for his first two volumes.

16:48.515 --> 16:59.951
some access for Volume 3, which came out about the time they were opened, and Richard Nelson Curran, who finished the last volume after Randall's death, used some of those papers in Volume 4.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.755
Thomas had little access.

17:02.815 --> 17:08.303
They were opened practically the time his book was in the press, and so on in that fashion.

17:08.643 --> 17:14.972
So, in that sense, those materials were not available to many of the previous biographers.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.796
Let me add some more current kinds of things.

17:18.890 --> 17:27.582
Out in Springfield for the past, I think, five, seven years, there's been a group called the Lincoln Legal Papers working.

17:27.602 --> 17:33.710
A scholar named Colm Davis is the head of that.

17:34.371 --> 17:42.602
They have been conducting an elaborate and detailed search of all the county courthouses as well as private libraries and so on.

17:42.818 --> 17:52.609
not merely in Illinois, but in Indiana, Missouri, and even in the District of Columbia in the Supreme Court records, for every case in which Abraham Lincoln was involved.

17:53.350 --> 18:01.320
They have collected some, I can give you 70,000 pages of documents, not all of which are by Abraham Lincoln.

18:01.960 --> 18:12.032
That is, if there was a case Lincoln was involved in, they'd get not merely what Lincoln said, but what the other side said, what the judge said, what the jury said, if they were involved, and so on.

18:12.822 --> 18:16.428
But this is an enormous amount of material.

18:17.650 --> 18:25.843
I was the first scholar allowed to use those papers, simply fortuitously, that I came along just at the time they got them all in order.

18:26.424 --> 18:37.041
They're getting ready to publish these, by the way, first on a CD-ROM, the entire thing, and later than that, maybe a three-volume letterpress edition.

18:37.696 --> 18:44.807
I have had better access to the story of Lincoln's legal career than anyone else.

18:45.508 --> 18:47.752
Let me just take a quick instance of this.

18:49.555 --> 18:56.065
We always had reports about how Lincoln was a great pleader in the courtroom, how effective he was, and so on.

18:56.586 --> 18:58.488
These are just the sort of stories.

18:58.529 --> 18:59.931
He was a very effective orator.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.957
But you don't recapture oratory that way.

19:04.915 --> 19:16.130
As these Lincoln legal scholars were just finishing their work, somebody, I think in California, found in an attic, in an old trunk, a transcript.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.815
The only transcript of a Lincoln case.

19:20.536 --> 19:26.323
The stenographer had been employed, who sat in the courtroom and took down every word.

19:27.084 --> 19:27.725
And there it is.

19:27.805 --> 19:33.673
Oh, it's a big, I can pull it out of the pile, a big sheaf of things, stuff about that pic.

19:34.278 --> 19:41.744
what Lincoln said, what the opposing attorney said, what the judge said, what the evidence was, how he made his pleading, and so on.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.025
Is it fairly verbatim?

19:43.146 --> 19:43.686
It is literally verbatim.

19:43.706 --> 19:49.631
So you can really see his language, his style, his thought, his thought processes.

19:49.711 --> 19:50.071
That's right.

19:50.452 --> 19:51.613
And that must have been fascinating.

19:51.633 --> 19:51.973
It's fascinating.

19:52.173 --> 19:52.994
That's right.

19:54.435 --> 19:55.536
What did you learn from that?

19:55.696 --> 19:57.438
I learned a lot about this.

19:58.118 --> 20:03.643
First of all, that Lincoln, an effective pleader, was not a man

20:03.775 --> 20:10.041
who got before the jury and made great emotional, passionate appeals.

20:10.061 --> 20:12.984
He was no Johnny Cochran, shall we say.

20:13.004 --> 20:13.825
Appalling as that was.

20:15.146 --> 20:25.096
His appeals were always low key to this jury, always kept very close to the case itself, never wandering off into broad general matters.

20:26.757 --> 20:32.483
But to be seen to digress here for a moment, it would have been very easy in this particular case

20:32.767 --> 21:01.407
to do just that, because the grandfather of a young man who had been killed in a murder case, the grandfather was Peter Cartwright, the noted Methodist evangelical exhorter, one of the most familiar people in the entire Middle West, whose testimony was taken and presented to the court.

21:01.741 --> 21:13.935
It would have been so easy to get on this and talk about the tears of the grandfather, this fine old man, what he's done for Methodism and religion and so on for the Little West, and just go on and on and on to do a Johnny Cochran, in other words.

21:14.496 --> 21:16.318
Lincoln didn't do any of that.

21:16.338 --> 21:20.203
He brought the man's testimony in against the wishes of the judge.

21:20.363 --> 21:30.955
The judge tried to excriminate, and Lincoln bore in on him point by point by point until he made the judge overrule himself, which is not usual, and allowed that evidence in.

21:31.441 --> 21:49.102
But he got it in in this low-key kind of fashion, so he tells the jury, look, this man was killed in this murder quarrel, but his grandfather, Peter Cartwright, testified, and you have the testimony in front of you, that before his death he said, I really am to blame.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.166
I attacked first, and I deserve what I got.

21:53.808 --> 21:54.308
And that did it.

21:54.809 --> 21:56.051
His client went free.

21:56.071 --> 21:57.212
He walked.

21:57.232 --> 22:01.397
But again, we had no way of knowing exactly how Lincoln

22:01.681 --> 22:07.888
performed in the courtroom until we had documents like this.

22:07.908 --> 22:13.554
On a very different level, those papers allow one to trace the evolution of Lincoln's style.

22:14.175 --> 22:24.847
The early Lincoln legal papers are incredibly verbose with tremendous numbers of to-wits and therefores and parties to the first part and parties to the second part.

22:25.848 --> 22:27.690
It's hard to make any sense out of them at all.

22:28.051 --> 22:28.772
Was he a good lawyer?

22:29.613 --> 22:29.933
Yes.

22:30.301 --> 22:34.225
He was a very good lawyer in nearly every way.

22:34.866 --> 22:40.232
He was effective in the courtroom.

22:40.473 --> 22:47.361
By the way, he discouraged litigation wherever he could, but if he got to the courtroom, he was effective.

22:47.461 --> 22:56.511
He was effective with the jury in the sense that I've said this is basically a rational appeal, not a highly emotional appeal.

22:57.605 --> 23:06.237
He was even more effective, though, and this came as something of a surprise to me, in the Illinois Supreme Court and in the United States Circuit Courts.

23:07.098 --> 23:11.164
There were, I guess there were district courts, actually, there were two of them in Illinois.

23:11.725 --> 23:23.201
Lincoln's pleadings in those cases show a great amount of research and very careful presentation of his arguments and citations of his authorities.

23:24.122 --> 23:26.245
The picture of Lincoln that

23:26.680 --> 23:36.689
most of us have had, and I think I probably had it in some earlier books too, a kind of a homespun country lawyer who, on the basis of charm and popularity, wooed the jury.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.771
This really is not the case.

23:39.512 --> 23:56.687
He was a very careful lawyer who presented his case quite clearly and accurately, and he took nothing for granted on the part of the court using as many citations as he could because he said, I just don't trust the court to remember these, and so if I don't put them in, they won't know about them.

23:57.950 --> 24:09.909
These were very effective arguments, and he was, if you had a batting average kind of thing, he was more successful in these higher courts than he was even in the lower circuit courts.

24:10.269 --> 24:11.952
He was then a very effective lawyer.

24:13.334 --> 24:20.345
He was not a great lawyer in some other ways, and I'd say he was a good lawyer, but I would say he's not a great lawyer.

24:20.365 --> 24:21.647
Make a little bit of difference here.

24:22.248 --> 24:26.134
There were several people, a number of people, and there are in every generation,

24:26.603 --> 24:28.345
in fact shaped the law.

24:28.886 --> 24:33.611
In his generation, this would have included, say, Rufus Choate of Massachusetts.

24:33.692 --> 24:38.938
It would have included David Dudley Field of New York, and perhaps a handful of others.

24:39.819 --> 24:43.303
Lincoln had little interest in legal theory.

24:43.824 --> 24:51.413
He probably never read — Herndon said, I think he's correct about it — he probably never read a general textbook on the law.

24:53.114 --> 25:05.910
When he had a case, he would do great research on that particular subject, and he said he liked the data by its roots and trace it down to the very smallest thing, precedent, that he could.

25:06.531 --> 25:16.984
But he was not interested in sort of abstract theories of justice, the role of law in society, whether law should favor one economic group versus another group.

25:17.404 --> 25:20.128
These were not questions that ever really occurred to him.

25:20.148 --> 25:21.990
He was just not interested in them.

25:22.527 --> 25:34.102
So, in that sense of a lawyer who shapes the nature of law, he was not a Daniel Webster, he was not a Rufus Cho, he was not a David W. Feeney.

25:34.122 --> 25:35.624
What were their surprises for you?

25:36.385 --> 25:38.508
Were there surprises about Lincoln for you?

25:38.588 --> 25:39.930
I wonder what some of them were.

25:40.931 --> 25:50.644
I think probably the one that came as the greatest surprise to me is my realization, which I was fairly late in coming to me.

25:51.113 --> 26:03.687
position I started with and said I'm going to prove this, my realization that Lincoln not merely was very slow and cautious, but that he was essentially a passive personality.

26:03.727 --> 26:09.533
Now, by that I don't in any sense mean that he sort of lounged around and was lazy.

26:10.314 --> 26:14.218
If you look at those thousands of pages laboriously written out by hand,

26:14.705 --> 26:23.573
in the Lincoln legal papers, to say nothing of those ten volumes over there of printed work, you realize this is a man who worked all the time, probably never had a hardworking person.

26:24.374 --> 26:28.538
It doesn't mean he was not hardworking, nor does it mean that he was without ambition.

26:28.638 --> 26:30.039
He was a very ambitious man.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.843
But he had no clear sense of direction.

26:34.003 --> 26:41.590
I think he had no absolute ideology, no steps toward attaining those ideological goals.

26:41.840 --> 26:49.688
that many statesmen do have, if one took— And yet you determined this from what?

26:49.708 --> 26:50.949
From examination?

26:50.989 --> 27:10.868
Just simply, as I worked side by side with him, saw the kinds of pressures that were on him, how easy it really would have been for him a number of times, as I'd take the lead and say, by golly, I'm standing out in front, let us go move against slavery, or on Reconstruction, or on martial law,

27:11.303 --> 27:15.028
And then you sort of look over your shoulder and see who's following me.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.073
Lincoln never did this.

27:18.093 --> 27:22.159
Well, you say working side by side with him, yet this is as you go through the documents.

27:22.199 --> 27:23.040
As I go through the documents.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.264
So you're seeing things absolutely in his hand.

27:25.904 --> 27:28.628
Not merely in his hand, but in everybody else's hand.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.051
So the observations of others.

27:30.471 --> 27:30.631
Right.

27:30.712 --> 27:34.477
What I've got—I'll show you around the corner there—Lincoln's papers.

27:34.757 --> 27:38.543
That is, the 97 reels of Lincoln's papers, which is

27:38.776 --> 27:42.261
approximately, I would guess, maybe 150,000 pages.

27:43.242 --> 27:49.051
These are the letters and other documents that Lincoln received, mostly as president.

27:49.071 --> 27:52.195
There are some pre-president, but mostly as president.

27:53.277 --> 28:06.015
And you will see what people were writing him, what advice they were giving him, how they were nudging him, always nudging him to move, take some action against the Confederacy, send some troops to Fort Sumter, get out of Fort Pickens,

28:06.434 --> 28:12.782
march your army down into Virginia, declare a naval blockade, declare war on the European powers.

28:13.102 --> 28:14.524
Everybody had an agenda.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.248
Lincoln was not in front of any of them.

28:17.348 --> 28:17.989
He listened.

28:18.609 --> 28:25.138
He usually had a little story that he would tell why he wouldn't do this and why he couldn't do that, and he would pass them off.

28:25.878 --> 28:31.285
Not really until forces around him became absolutely uncontrollable.

28:31.906 --> 28:33.488
He then moved.

28:34.042 --> 28:41.830
And when he moved, there was a marvel of timing about it, because when he moved, by that time, public opinion had consolidated.

28:41.971 --> 28:46.195
He was not that general that I sat out in front with his flag looking over his shoulder.

28:46.716 --> 28:48.778
He was right solidly in front of his army.

28:49.399 --> 28:51.441
And this was, I think, Lincoln's great genius.

28:52.142 --> 28:55.986
At what point does he begin to develop for you as a personality?

28:57.307 --> 29:02.513
Of course, the biographer's responsibility is to tell a full life, I guess.

29:02.678 --> 29:05.221
You must be ever mindful of that as you're going along.

29:05.642 --> 29:10.308
Well, I think it might help to talk a little about how this book was written.

29:10.949 --> 29:15.295
It was not written from chapter one.

29:16.556 --> 29:21.182
In fact, I think it's chapter 12 or something like that was my first chapter.

29:21.202 --> 29:22.985
I started in the middle.

29:23.886 --> 29:27.450
I finished it all, including the assassination and death.

29:28.592 --> 29:32.517
Once that was done, then I went back to the earlier chapters.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.963
And I did this for two reasons.

29:34.983 --> 29:48.003
First of all, nearly all of the biographies that do exist, and I've had felt this for many years, slight the latter half of Lincoln's presidency, primarily because the biographer gets tired.

29:49.946 --> 29:59.500
If you're Nicolet and Hay, and you've written seven volumes to bring Lincoln up to 1863, the last two years you sort of give a lick and a promise and say, let's get it over with.

30:01.117 --> 30:10.407
I would not say, and I certainly don't want you to publish anything against Stephen Oates, whose poor fellow he had to take these licks on other grounds as well.

30:10.787 --> 30:21.618
But if you look at his book, you will realize that the last three years of Lincoln's presidency occupy less than 100 pages out of a 600, 700 page book.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.802
And I won't mention those, but you would say he gave him short shrift.

30:24.822 --> 30:25.062
Yes.

30:26.003 --> 30:27.665
Again, I think he got tired.

30:28.445 --> 30:30.988
So I decided I was not going to do that.

30:31.340 --> 30:36.627
that whatever happened, I was going to have the last part of it rather richly researched and written up.

30:36.647 --> 30:39.571
But there was another, and I think a better reason for doing this.

30:40.993 --> 30:47.482
Namely, if you start at the beginning, you're introducing things, and how do you know what to introduce?

30:47.542 --> 30:59.558
How do you know whether this is going to become important or that a friend, for example, an acquaintance, practice a certain kind of law, a decision not to run for Congress,

30:59.808 --> 31:01.991
a decision to leave the Whig Party.

31:02.792 --> 31:11.182
You don't really know, and so unless you include absolutely everything, you may not have introduced what you're going to need later on.

31:12.223 --> 31:18.150
If you've finished your story off at that end, by that time you know what you need to say.

31:18.731 --> 31:24.938
You're going to have to say something, if you do it my way, you would have to say something about how Lincoln exerted

31:25.238 --> 31:27.622
leadership within the Republican Party.

31:27.902 --> 31:41.823
So you go back to the beginning and watch for traces of this and how he developed, how he grew in the Whig Party, how he transferred those talents over to the Republican Party, and how he used and moved to promote himself and the party and so on in the pre-war years.

31:42.924 --> 31:47.972
So that the last half of the book was written, I then went back to the beginning

31:48.256 --> 31:54.046
And I had all sorts of people watching me and reading chapters, and they said, how are you ever going to link these up?

31:54.067 --> 31:54.828
Are you sure?

31:54.848 --> 31:58.314
I kept saying, you know, this is like a spacewalk.

31:59.056 --> 32:02.983
You have a shuttle up here, and there's going to link up with this one.

32:03.123 --> 32:05.387
I hope it's going to be like that.

32:05.806 --> 32:06.847
And I hope it did.

32:06.887 --> 32:08.789
So you say you started with chapter 11, I guess?

32:08.889 --> 32:09.690
I think it was chapter 11.

32:09.790 --> 32:11.491
The one on the Emancipation Proclamation.

32:12.252 --> 32:14.454
These are the fun parts, I suppose, too, to write.

32:14.574 --> 32:21.801
So you started probably with what I would imagine as a writer are the fun parts, because you have him at the height of his powers.

32:21.821 --> 32:23.183
I think that's right.

32:23.683 --> 32:32.792
And these are also the chapters where, in my opinion, significant questions have not hitherto been asked.

32:33.110 --> 32:36.815
Let me try this, for example, skipping for a moment.

32:37.416 --> 32:38.377
The Gettysburg Address.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.301
Everybody writes about the Gettysburg Address, and they should.

32:41.321 --> 32:43.363
It's a very great document.

32:43.383 --> 32:46.768
There's a marvelous whole book on it.

32:47.268 --> 32:52.275
And he examines Lincoln's rhetoric and the sources of his ideas and so on.

32:52.655 --> 32:57.181
He never asks, though, why did Lincoln decide to accept this invitation?

32:57.201 --> 33:00.265
Lincoln, as president, virtually never left Washington.

33:00.548 --> 33:02.771
He made no public speeches at all.

33:02.831 --> 33:07.017
He said it wouldn't be becoming for a person in this position to make speeches.

33:07.839 --> 33:10.042
He just didn't do things like this.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.806
Apart from anything else, he was a hardworking man.

33:13.647 --> 33:14.869
The armies were in the field.

33:14.969 --> 33:17.092
He needed to be there and control.

33:17.112 --> 33:17.693
So he didn't do it.

33:18.073 --> 33:20.216
Yet in this particular case, he did.

33:21.078 --> 33:22.360
Why was it important enough?

33:22.420 --> 33:24.262
What did he hope to accomplish?

33:24.543 --> 33:26.185
Why did Lincoln go to Gettysburg?

33:27.785 --> 33:31.910
I read all the literature on it, and there's a lot of very good literature on it.

33:31.930 --> 33:33.892
You said literature, now you're talking about the published literature.

33:33.932 --> 33:35.094
That's right, all the published literature.

33:35.334 --> 33:37.056
I don't think anybody ever asked this question.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.638
They just don't know.

33:38.838 --> 33:41.301
So, has this question been bugging you for years then?

33:41.582 --> 33:43.043
Is this something that you... No.

33:43.324 --> 33:54.417
As I was working through, and I was getting ready to analyze the Gettysburg Address and all those things that other people have done very nicely indeed, it occurred to me, well,

33:54.700 --> 33:57.444
That is all true, but why did he do it?

33:57.925 --> 33:59.507
What did he have in mind?

33:59.568 --> 34:02.973
Why take this occasion of all occasions?

34:03.754 --> 34:06.037
It was not a particularly auspicious time.

34:06.098 --> 34:10.104
Tad Lincoln, the little boy, was sick.

34:10.605 --> 34:13.669
Mary Lincoln, his wife, was in a state of total hysterics.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.153
She recently lost one poor little boy.

34:16.193 --> 34:18.717
She thought she was going to lose another one.

34:19.490 --> 34:25.279
It was a bad time in terms of military strategy and the state of the armies.

34:25.780 --> 34:27.362
Lincoln himself was not feeling well.

34:27.422 --> 34:34.072
He came back from Gettysburg with a case of varialoid, which is kind of a minor grade of smallpox.

34:34.433 --> 34:38.018
There's not one good reason why he had to go.

34:38.098 --> 34:41.003
And indeed, they didn't make him think he was going to go.

34:41.023 --> 34:43.827
I mean, they were pleased, of course.

34:44.363 --> 34:52.551
And they extended him the invitation, but there was nobody who thought, well, gosh, we can't have any dedication if Lincoln doesn't come.

34:53.552 --> 34:54.854
But, lo and behold, there he is.

34:55.074 --> 34:58.397
And so, what's this all about?

34:58.918 --> 35:01.320
What moved him at this time?

35:01.340 --> 35:01.841
What was it going to be?

35:01.861 --> 35:03.643
Well, did they ask those questions then, too?

35:03.663 --> 35:03.723
No.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.805
They didn't ask those questions then either?

35:05.865 --> 35:07.346
No, no.

35:08.187 --> 35:09.228
Let me shift a little bit.

35:09.248 --> 35:09.889
I've just been asked.

35:09.909 --> 35:12.071
Well, I want the answer of how you found it out.

35:12.091 --> 35:14.033
You had to read my book.

35:14.401 --> 35:20.208
I want you to tell me how you determined me, how you included me.

35:20.228 --> 35:24.133
Let me shift just a little bit for a modern example.

35:24.153 --> 35:32.864
Last week, I guess it was, I was at Fort Wayne, Indiana, where they dedicated a new Lincoln Museum, sponsored by the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company.

35:33.124 --> 35:42.636
It's a beautiful museum, by the way, and a wonderful place to visit, and it's a hands-on, interactive museum, and a fun place to go.

35:43.240 --> 35:57.216
For the dedication, they had invited quite properly Gerald Ford to make some speeches, to make a speech, because he was familiar by Michigan, and Indiana is close, and so forth and so on.

35:57.236 --> 36:02.042
They had also naturally, though, invited President Clinton.

36:02.062 --> 36:08.410
They got no answer from the White House, and they kept hoping at the end, well, maybe he will show up.

36:08.430 --> 36:09.811
But on the other hand, maybe he won't.

36:09.831 --> 36:11.633
We can't build a program about him.

36:11.793 --> 36:13.095
He doesn't show up.

36:13.531 --> 36:20.360
And so they just went on and built the program and were ready to adapt it at the last minute and plug him in in case he did so.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.744
The Gettysburg dedication was something like this.

36:24.665 --> 36:28.811
They got Edward Everett, who was supposed to be the greatest orator in America.

36:29.572 --> 36:39.905
He had gone around the country making orations, and beside that he'd been president of Harvard, senator of Massachusetts, secretary of state, minister to England.

36:39.925 --> 36:41.547
He'd been everything.

36:42.404 --> 36:49.434
And so the assumption was that he will make the great speech, and he written it out and memorized it, all like that.

36:49.974 --> 36:53.079
So Lincoln was asked, so to speak, to come along.

36:54.020 --> 36:54.841
And as I say, he did.

36:56.023 --> 36:58.867
Well, you ask, how do I know why he went?

36:59.768 --> 37:03.373
Fundamentally, it's partly a process of elimination.

37:03.833 --> 37:10.943
It's partly a process of asking what good could be served by an appearance on an occasion like this.

37:11.598 --> 37:14.401
and to make a very long story, quite short.

37:15.382 --> 37:19.026
He knew in advance what Edward Everett had to say.

37:19.266 --> 37:24.372
He did not have a text of Edward Everett's speech, but Edward Everett had been making similar speeches all over the country.

37:25.333 --> 37:34.302
It was essentially a speech that said, we of the North and you of the South are all of one people, all of one race, one tradition, and so on.

37:34.823 --> 37:35.243
We

37:35.358 --> 37:38.080
really need to get together as quickly as we can.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.902
We ought to cease this fighting.

37:39.922 --> 37:44.486
We ought to lay down our arms and negotiate for peace.

37:44.506 --> 37:52.974
With this as the keynote at that dedication, Lincoln realized this might have a very powerful effect on peace sentiment throughout the North.

37:54.095 --> 37:56.377
It was necessary to do something about this.

37:56.417 --> 37:57.778
He couldn't muzzle it or whatever.

37:57.838 --> 37:58.919
Nobody could do that.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.903
He couldn't make a long speech to counteract it or whatever.

38:03.003 --> 38:04.504
Everybody would listen to that.

38:04.906 --> 38:16.178
What he did was, in effect, to change the terms of the discourse, so that people heard Edward Everett, and they were moved, and then Lincoln put it on a different ground altogether.

38:16.658 --> 38:23.185
What we're talking about is not common grounds of race and language and customs.

38:23.606 --> 38:31.774
What we're talking about here is the destiny of freedom on our continent, and not merely on our continent, but for free men everywhere.

38:32.176 --> 38:35.100
And that shifts the whole line of argument.

38:35.361 --> 38:44.674
Freedom and equality become then the Union war-aimed, rather than simply peace and restoration of the Union, which was evidence of war.

38:45.436 --> 38:57.313
Now, did you produce this primarily from your biographer's skill, or, I mean, your instinct, or was it something in the records that you found that convinced you with this?

38:57.333 --> 39:00.057
There are things in the record, but Lincoln

39:00.745 --> 39:02.187
He was a very cagey man.

39:02.948 --> 39:08.876
Nowhere did he say, gosh, I've got to get up to Gettysburg and cut off Edward Everett in the past.

39:09.697 --> 39:11.459
No, he never did things.

39:11.719 --> 39:16.686
There's a remarkable exchange of letters from Edward Everett.

39:16.766 --> 39:19.830
At the Massachusetts Historical Society, they have the original document.

39:19.850 --> 39:20.251
That's right.

39:20.311 --> 39:20.952
They're wonderful.

39:21.793 --> 39:29.723
And they are very polite, and it is clear, I think, from reading those letters, each was aware of what had happened.

39:30.007 --> 39:35.992
Namely, Edward was aware that Lincoln had Trump in his age.

39:36.012 --> 39:36.613
Big time.

39:36.633 --> 39:38.815
Yeah.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.437
And Lincoln was very gracious about it.

39:41.457 --> 39:46.402
Tell me a little bit about being a native of the South, a son of the South.

39:46.422 --> 39:46.522
Okay.

39:46.542 --> 39:50.405
I read some things where you said that, but it is, it certainly is.

39:50.766 --> 39:59.153
I know I went to a reading at the Smithsonian years ago when Walker Percy and Laura Welty

39:59.453 --> 40:07.420
Van Woodward, Southern as all, read from the works of Hawthorne and Parkman and Melville, you know.

40:08.000 --> 40:18.349
And it was kind of cute to see these mid-20th century Southern writers paying homage to 19th century Northern writers, you know.

40:18.489 --> 40:20.551
It was quite an interesting thing.

40:20.571 --> 40:22.393
I know there's some Library of America books over there.

40:22.433 --> 40:22.893
I love them.

40:23.374 --> 40:25.215
Yes, that's a great project.

40:25.596 --> 40:28.498
Tell me a little bit about that.

40:28.816 --> 40:31.680
an intimidating aspect for you?

40:31.760 --> 40:37.127
I shouldn't think it would be, but being a native southerner... I don't think so.

40:37.187 --> 40:43.114
First of all, I'm a fairly fraudulent southerner.

40:43.174 --> 40:54.109
I was born in Mississippi, I grew up in Mississippi, but I left at the age of 20, 21, thereabouts to go away to graduate school, and I spent all the rest of my life in various northern institutions.

40:54.349 --> 40:56.832
That doesn't bring a perspective to it, I would say.

40:57.554 --> 40:59.916
I have a Southern family.

41:00.056 --> 41:01.297
I go back and visit them.

41:02.759 --> 41:17.171
I love many parts of the South, and perhaps have more and deeper friends in the South than anywhere else, because on the whole, friends you make in young life tend perhaps to be more enduring than others.

41:18.553 --> 41:26.920
But I'm also fraudulent in another way, in that my maternal grandfather was an officer in the Union Cavalry.

41:27.575 --> 41:29.637
He fought with Sheridan in the valley.

41:30.998 --> 41:38.226
After the war, he went back to Dartmouth and graduated, and then came south to teach in the Freedmen's Bureau schools in Mississippi.

41:38.907 --> 41:44.212
The Freedmen, after all, lacked education, and there was a kind of a missionary zeal.

41:44.572 --> 41:50.138
What can we do for these poor creatures who've just been made citizens and who can't read and write?

41:50.158 --> 41:54.983
So he established Freedmen's Schools in central Mississippi, a little place called

41:55.452 --> 41:57.755
And he taught there for a number of years.

41:58.756 --> 42:06.425
Then the family legend is always that after a period of years, he discovered that the whites in Mississippi needed education worse than the blacks did.

42:07.346 --> 42:13.413
That's not altogether true, but Reedman's Bureau schools were closed down as Congress refused to pay any money for them.

42:14.054 --> 42:21.963
And he did shift over to the white schools and became superintendent of schools and ran the school system until he died.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.126
I have some way.

42:24.764 --> 42:26.586
produce it if necessary.

42:26.606 --> 42:35.498
A picture of, by Grandfather Belford, that I think is sort of a, has a kind of iconographic significance.

42:35.518 --> 42:44.050
They're in this very modest kind of house, a long, low slung wooden house out of Tacona, Mississippi.

42:45.272 --> 42:49.798
They're standing out in front to have that picture made, because she stood very formally, they were all properly dressed.

42:49.818 --> 42:54.484
Here's Grandfather Belford on one side, Grandmother Belford on the other.

42:54.785 --> 42:59.512
my mother and her little brother bracing them on each side.

43:00.213 --> 43:04.659
They are out near sort of the road, the house in the background.

43:04.679 --> 43:11.709
Approximately five, six steps behind them, a little off to the left, is the colored man.

43:13.091 --> 43:18.779
She is clearly a member of her family, but she clearly on the other end is not in that first line.

43:18.819 --> 43:20.221
She's a little bit behind.

43:21.022 --> 43:24.707
And then the house itself and on the wall is spread

43:25.784 --> 43:27.285
the flag of the United States.

43:28.186 --> 43:33.752
People in, this is 1880s, in Mississippi you didn't spread the flag of the United States.

43:33.772 --> 43:35.614
He's making a statement.

43:35.674 --> 43:47.926
Again, flag of the United States, the position of blacks, proper middle class, now southern white, but of Northern origins.

43:49.147 --> 43:54.272
Okay, this is maybe something different from Walker Percy.

43:54.590 --> 44:02.498
with a great line of very, very Southern, wonderful Southern backgrounds.

44:02.959 --> 44:05.061
That's a very different line.

44:05.721 --> 44:08.845
I don't think of myself as sort of born and bred in the South.

44:09.305 --> 44:18.094
I never in my life ever had a feeling that the Confederacy was such a great thing or when they played Dixie or any such thing as that.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.196
Well, I wasn't suggesting that in any way.

44:20.216 --> 44:21.137
I was just wondering

44:21.404 --> 44:28.995
Because you were weird in the South, there certainly must be some kind of absorbed textures and the nuances.

44:29.356 --> 44:32.521
Well, I think that probably is true.

44:32.761 --> 44:43.097
I guess maybe, if anything, it has made me more understanding of Lincoln's attitudes toward blacks.

44:43.638 --> 44:47.884
As if you grew up in a totally segregated society, as I grew up in,

44:48.910 --> 44:52.315
where blacks were treated really as an inferior order of beings.

44:53.076 --> 45:02.812
You don't find it quite that impossible to understand how Abraham Lincoln could have regarded blacks as not his social or moral equal, that's what he said.

45:02.832 --> 45:07.118
He didn't favor giving them their vote or having them to serve on juries and so on.

45:08.120 --> 45:16.032
Now, I guess if I'd been born in Maine and read such statements as Lincoln, they would have seemed thoroughly outrageous.

45:16.315 --> 45:26.889
Born in Mississippi, they seem actually fairly liberal, because he was willing, first of all, to have seen them freed, and to protect them in basic rights of life, liberty, and property.

45:27.930 --> 45:36.081
So in that sense, I think there is maybe some perspective that might be a little bit different.

45:36.101 --> 45:42.169
I wonder if you could talk just generally about the mission of the biographer, because you've done so many wonderful biographies.

45:42.710 --> 45:45.293
And I remember when we talked about Thomas Wolfe,

45:45.965 --> 45:56.314
I was so impressed by the fact that you disdained applying these techniques of psychobiography to what would, in essence, have been a sitting duck.

45:56.334 --> 45:58.697
I mean, the wolf was vulnerable.

45:59.297 --> 46:08.586
And I would be glad if you could just talk generally about your attitude towards that and how you brought it to bear in your work on this book.

46:08.606 --> 46:13.390
Well, I've grown, I think, in my conception of what it

46:13.775 --> 46:17.019
biography is and what a biographer should do.

46:17.660 --> 46:26.610
Originally I thought a biography as simply an adjunct to history and a way of discussing historical problems on a kind of a case study basis.

46:26.630 --> 46:40.506
I no longer think that to be the case, and increasingly I have come to feel that a biographer's primary duty is to tell a story and to recreate a character just as if he were writing a novel.

46:41.387 --> 46:43.630
It's more difficult, I think, than

46:44.032 --> 47:02.132
writing a novel for the reason that, and we hope this is the case, he can't invent things, he can't put his hero in the wrong place at the time he wasn't there, he can't have him saying things that he really should have said, but never got around to saying, or that he should think he should have said.

47:03.073 --> 47:11.743
But I think the task is nevertheless the same, that there ought to be a kind of a build-up of

47:12.297 --> 47:32.765
empathy for your character, an understanding of how he goes about his task, how he grows and changes over a period of time, until perhaps by the end one has a sense that, my, this is almost like a character in a good novel.

47:33.786 --> 47:40.515
And that seems to me is the primary function, is the recapturing of personality

47:41.407 --> 47:42.729
in a narrative form.

47:44.731 --> 47:50.819
For this reason, my biography is primarily, though not exclusively, chronological.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.143
Namely, I don't jump back and forth.

47:54.323 --> 48:01.071
I don't, in treating Lincoln's early life, say, aha, this shows up when he was President of the United States.

48:01.832 --> 48:03.014
I think that would be a mistake.

48:03.034 --> 48:05.176
It puts you out of context.

48:05.196 --> 48:10.603
If you were writing a novel, you wouldn't, in your early chapters, say, oh, well,

48:10.837 --> 48:15.104
we'll see about this later on, you don't do it that way.

48:15.905 --> 48:24.578
So in many ways I regard biography as sort of an intermediary stage between history on the one side and fiction on the other.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.762
That's quite a challenge.

48:26.782 --> 48:31.950
Well, if anybody ever says, and a few people have been good enough to say, it reads like a novel,

48:32.791 --> 48:37.216
They may not always intend it to be flattering, but I take it as the greatest compliment.

48:37.236 --> 48:40.320
Well, storytelling, to a degree, is important then, isn't it?

48:40.340 --> 48:40.520
It is.

48:41.181 --> 48:43.844
It's necessary to engage the reader.

48:44.265 --> 48:48.690
But, you see, this is not the prevailing mode of history.

48:48.710 --> 48:58.242
History these days, increasingly, is one of a mode of analysis, of breaking down into small... Deconstructions.

48:58.357 --> 49:01.040
often deconstruction and sometimes statistical.

49:01.060 --> 49:05.646
I'd like to address yourself to that at some point, too, your attitude briefly on it.

49:05.666 --> 49:06.687
I don't want to jump ahead.

49:06.707 --> 49:07.288
I'm sorry.

49:07.308 --> 49:16.659
And this is all perfectly proper, except that by and large, you know, most people don't and can't read history.

49:16.679 --> 49:23.528
Whereas lots and lots of people, thousands and thousands of people do read biography and get caught up in it.

49:23.888 --> 49:27.773
And I'm sort of very pleased that

49:28.225 --> 49:29.907
The book hasn't actually been published.

49:30.528 --> 49:34.934
I'm already getting something in the neighborhood of 20 letters a day from people.

49:35.075 --> 49:35.655
Are you really?

49:35.715 --> 49:37.097
Yes, it's sort of wonderful.

49:37.438 --> 49:42.705
And often there are people who read and they say very nice things indeed.

49:42.725 --> 49:48.854
And they say, I don't quite agree with what you said on page 47 because I don't feel that way about it.

49:49.114 --> 49:51.417
And I think in some ways that's the best thing that could happen.

49:51.437 --> 49:56.865
That must be something for a professional scholar, an educator.

49:58.668 --> 50:09.259
who was trained by rigid discipline to be able to write for a general audience.

50:09.319 --> 50:12.142
I think that is so important.

50:12.703 --> 50:15.686
I think one really has to work at it.

50:16.787 --> 50:21.292
You might be just mildly interested in the way I actually work.

50:21.953 --> 50:25.096
Namely, first of all, I'll do what every historian does.

50:25.116 --> 50:25.637
I take notes.

50:26.343 --> 50:27.625
I take notes.

50:27.645 --> 50:31.750
I read every page of those 97 reels of the Lincoln papers, I can tell you that.

50:32.451 --> 50:35.456
And I read many other collections and so on.

50:35.916 --> 50:37.038
I take notes on them all.

50:37.599 --> 50:40.322
My notes are on computer, I can show you here.

50:40.703 --> 50:45.209
They are approximately 12,000 pages of notes there.

50:45.850 --> 50:50.396
So, when I get ready to write, we will say about the Emancipation Proclamation.

50:50.456 --> 50:53.160
First of all, it's much easier now we have computers.

50:53.697 --> 51:02.345
to pull out everything in my notes that deals with the Emancipation Proclamation over that period of time from, we will say, July through September 1862.

51:02.405 --> 51:20.482
I take those notes out together with Lincoln's works and simply sit down and read through them, just literally as though I'm trying to decide was the Emancipation Proclamation issued, literally on a day-by-day basis.

51:21.242 --> 51:23.164
When that's done, I try

51:23.482 --> 51:31.236
put my books back on the shelf, close down that section of my computer, and try to write on the basis of what I remember.

51:32.318 --> 51:44.680
My feeling is that if I can't remember who wrote to whom, what date somebody wrote on, the words that he used, if I can't remember that, having taken those notes in the first place, having just read them,

51:45.166 --> 51:48.830
If I can't remember it, they probably aren't memorable and shouldn't be in the book anyhow.

51:49.130 --> 51:52.634
So you really, when you're actually sitting down to write, you don't have a pile of material?

51:52.654 --> 51:54.676
I don't have a pile of material beside me.

51:54.936 --> 51:58.200
I have a computer screen and I work on it like a word processor.

51:58.220 --> 52:03.845
I'm really impressed that you use the computer as extensively as you do.

52:03.865 --> 52:05.687
I don't see how we ever did without it.

52:05.968 --> 52:08.110
I just don't see how we ever did without it.

52:08.130 --> 52:09.692
I want to go one more step on it.

52:10.012 --> 52:14.937
I sit at the computer and compose, and as I compose,

52:16.115 --> 52:36.244
I then read back my sentences aloud, and if I can't read them aloud with some sense of rhythm and make it easy for me to hear and understand, then I know that there's something wrong, and so I change it, and I change it, and I change it, and I change it, and I read it aloud again.

52:37.045 --> 52:37.866
I think you'd be amused.

52:37.886 --> 52:44.856
When this library ring was being built, I was working on this book, and I was sitting in another room there with my computer.

52:45.241 --> 52:47.809
composing and reading, composing and reading.

52:47.829 --> 52:52.364
One time at lunch, I just stopped for a few minutes, went out of the yard.

52:52.384 --> 52:54.612
I heard two of the carpenters talking to each other.

52:54.652 --> 52:57.782
One said to the other, you think he's all right?

52:58.235 --> 53:02.761
Well, I guess he is, but you know, he sits there talking to himself all day long.

53:02.782 --> 53:03.943
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

53:04.163 --> 53:05.105
Isn't that wonderful?

53:05.545 --> 53:07.308
I don't know, maybe it wasn't all right.

53:07.468 --> 53:09.591
What kind of a software do you have for the notes?

53:09.611 --> 53:11.854
Is it a database type of thing?

53:11.875 --> 53:13.737
Yeah, it's FileMaker Pro.

53:13.757 --> 53:14.879
Would you like to see it?

53:15.640 --> 53:16.581
Sure, yeah.

53:16.681 --> 53:21.989
I'll get a chance to check my tape, too.

53:24.553 --> 53:24.833
You're up.

53:29.723 --> 53:39.673
So you use two screens here, which is... I don't really need two screens, but this came with the set, and this I need because of the large type.

53:40.454 --> 53:46.740
So we'll be ready in just a second.

53:46.760 --> 53:53.767
Okay, now that's just plain old Microsoft Word.

53:53.787 --> 53:55.309
Now these are the actual...

53:56.538 --> 53:57.680
Now, I'm bringing up notes.

53:57.700 --> 53:59.282
Well, you're even using the mouse, too.

53:59.302 --> 54:00.303
Isn't that something?

54:00.323 --> 54:01.044
Do you use a computer?

54:01.404 --> 54:03.187
Oh, I couldn't work without one.

54:03.307 --> 54:04.889
But I don't have anything quite like this.

54:04.929 --> 54:06.992
This is called Claris FileMaker Pro.

54:07.012 --> 54:09.195
And that's a database.

54:09.255 --> 54:10.697
That's exactly right.

54:11.918 --> 54:13.781
So you can search by keywords.

54:13.821 --> 54:18.107
You can search by... You can store by any number of different categories.

54:18.127 --> 54:19.028
Here we are.

54:19.228 --> 54:20.750
Well, 11,000 notes.

54:21.371 --> 54:24.435
And what I have here... You can do this any way you want to.

54:24.685 --> 54:26.867
I have, they're called fields.

54:27.528 --> 54:29.330
This field is simply the date.

54:29.711 --> 54:35.958
It's the date referred to, and not necessarily the date when it was written, but described.

54:36.318 --> 54:40.203
This is a caption that is like a newspaper headline.

54:40.263 --> 54:42.666
Now, you assign these or research it as these fields?

54:42.686 --> 54:44.748
I make these up, yeah.

54:45.909 --> 54:51.596
I try to get like a good newspaper headline that tells really everything that's going to be in that story.

54:51.616 --> 54:52.537
That's right.

54:52.837 --> 54:53.938
Like a headline almost.

54:53.958 --> 54:54.439
Exactly, a headline.

54:54.824 --> 54:58.709
Then this is the source field that tells you where you got it.

54:59.531 --> 55:03.777
And then this is the actual note itself.

55:03.797 --> 55:05.459
Now is that typed in or scanned in?

55:05.599 --> 55:07.402
That's typed in.

55:07.422 --> 55:09.064
I do have a scanner here.

55:09.224 --> 55:11.587
I found it not very satisfactory.

55:13.330 --> 55:17.135
First of all, scanning is not all that accurate.

55:17.155 --> 55:23.464
And second, by the time you get it scanned and you then have to put it back into a language and put it in these notes,

55:24.490 --> 55:25.711
I'm a very fast typist.

55:25.731 --> 55:28.814
I find it easier to do the typing on myself.

55:28.834 --> 55:32.197
But let's just see what kinds of things one we get.

55:32.217 --> 55:34.239
All right.

55:34.259 --> 55:37.162
So what field did you decide to search?

55:37.222 --> 55:40.045
What I did do was just to move from one note to another.

55:40.125 --> 55:40.505
I see.

55:40.825 --> 55:41.646
Oh, look at that.

55:41.666 --> 55:42.647
It's even got a little device.

55:42.927 --> 55:47.091
Yes, it's like leaving a Rolodex or something like that.

55:48.092 --> 55:48.913
That's wonderful.

55:49.514 --> 55:51.155
I don't know whether you can see from there.

55:51.175 --> 55:51.555
I can.

55:51.676 --> 55:52.797
I've got my new glasses on.

55:52.817 --> 55:54.278
I can see it.

55:55.017 --> 55:57.360
notes of any great consequence.

55:57.380 --> 55:58.441
No, but they're there.

55:58.602 --> 56:00.364
One needs to know things like that.

56:00.864 --> 56:10.637
Well, the beauty of being able to access them so quickly, I mean, I have 120 actual notebooks at home, you know, that I keep going through to find these notes.

56:11.538 --> 56:15.763
To have something like this, I think, is so clear, too.

56:16.244 --> 56:22.071
I mean, the fact that you're able to... Now, you see, if I wanted to pull out a

56:22.658 --> 56:30.307
Everything on Lincoln received or wrote on the day after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

56:30.788 --> 56:49.251
I would simply have a search for this field here and put in that date, that would be September 2030, 1962, and all of those notes would be bunched right there together, and they would be arranged chronologically within that date, and I'd be able to see what kind of response.

56:49.731 --> 56:50.472
That's wonderful.

56:51.211 --> 56:55.776
So I do keep a hard copy of everything.

56:55.796 --> 57:15.777
Though I love computers, and though I have much in the way of backup, I have this on my hard disk here, I have an external hard disk, I have a SyQuest removable hard disk, and I have one of these in the safety box in the bank.

57:15.797 --> 57:19.181
I do a little less worry, and so I have everything on paper too.

57:19.201 --> 57:20.442
So how often do you print out?

57:20.877 --> 57:22.560
It depends on what I want.

57:22.640 --> 57:37.625
If I, for example, if I wanted to say, you asked me, what can you tell me about Lincoln and railroad cases, I would then have a search, a very quick search made out here, and type in railroad in this field.

57:37.705 --> 57:39.729
So that would have to have been in that field there.

57:39.769 --> 57:42.413
That's correct.

57:42.612 --> 57:46.418
my caption is not good, then it doesn't help me very much.

57:46.718 --> 57:47.620
But that's true of any note.

57:47.640 --> 57:47.940
That's right.

57:47.960 --> 57:51.165
You have to be alert to that at the very beginning.

57:51.185 --> 57:51.466
Exactly right.

57:51.486 --> 57:58.116
And then that would bring me up probably, I would guess, maybe 250, 350 notes on railroad.

57:58.136 --> 57:59.858
And how many different fields are you allowed?

57:59.898 --> 58:04.826
Oh, you can put in almost as many as you could think of space.

58:04.926 --> 58:05.467
Oh, really?

58:05.808 --> 58:05.908
Yeah.

58:05.928 --> 58:07.230
I'm not sure why you want to.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.732
So you're probably limited by a page.

58:09.313 --> 58:09.413
Yeah.

58:09.916 --> 58:10.997
That's a page, I would say.

58:11.017 --> 58:12.159
That's a legal size page.

58:12.179 --> 58:13.901
Let's see what I can get.

58:16.684 --> 58:17.205
I'm sorry.

58:17.405 --> 58:18.567
This is fascinating to me.

58:19.308 --> 58:20.770
I'm getting ready to start my next book.

58:20.870 --> 58:28.800
Let's see what we're going to do here.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.361
These are all my fields.

58:30.381 --> 58:31.583
This is the date field.

58:31.603 --> 58:32.464
Oh, there they are, sure.

58:32.484 --> 58:34.066
Capture your source text.

58:34.306 --> 58:36.850
And you see, I can just keep on adding there.

58:36.870 --> 58:37.150
That's right.

58:37.170 --> 58:38.411
And you can have a miscellaneous.

58:38.552 --> 58:39.653
That's right.

58:39.987 --> 58:52.087
If, for example, I wanted to have, as you suggested, an extra field at the bottom that might be my commentary on that I could put that as an extra separate subject.

58:52.107 --> 58:58.978
Even when you call up something, you might have wanted to make a comment that you preserve with that text that you see when you get there.

58:59.439 --> 59:00.020
That's right.

59:00.060 --> 59:00.440
That's great.

59:00.601 --> 59:02.704
I just have a couple more questions I'll ask you.
