WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:03.550
And now back on again.

00:03.970 --> 00:04.671
Side two.

00:08.136 --> 00:14.924
The tape is cheap, my friend.

00:15.825 --> 00:23.375
I can tell you only that there are three other Washington letters here.

00:23.435 --> 00:27.079
DocuSend.

00:27.099 --> 00:28.401
Find here.

00:31.672 --> 00:32.393
in the collection.

00:34.415 --> 00:38.421
But there are some fun things, too.

00:38.441 --> 01:01.510
For instance, Gay Randall knew of my interest in my little Dutch girlfriend, Margarita Ketwieda Zellem McLeod, a Dutch girl married to a Dutch oxen McLeod, who, uh, applied for a passport, visa and passport, into France in

01:02.013 --> 01:07.259
End of 1960, it probably didn't go in until January 17.

01:07.279 --> 01:10.623
And as we say in the trade, it's signed in, true name and sue name.

01:11.584 --> 01:19.252
It's a fun vacuum.

01:19.433 --> 01:20.193
M. G. Zella MacLeod.

01:26.901 --> 01:27.762
Mata Hari.

01:28.903 --> 01:30.525
Mata Hari.

01:30.545 --> 01:31.446
It's their last...

01:33.113 --> 01:34.875
Please ask occasionally to go in the front.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.296
This is Matt.

01:35.916 --> 01:54.298
For the sake of my typist here, who's probably going to be confused, we're looking at a visa application signed by, has two names, Mata, M-A-T-A dash, with an accent, Hari, H-A-R-I, and her name, her given name is what again?

01:54.478 --> 01:55.940
Margarita.

01:55.980 --> 02:00.545
M-A-R-G-U-E-R-I-T-E.

02:00.565 --> 02:02.047
Right.

02:02.067 --> 02:02.327
Mecca.

02:02.628 --> 02:08.914
Margarita is M-A-R-G-A-R-E-P-H-A.

02:14.840 --> 02:26.751
Gertrida is G-E-R-T-R-U-I-D-A.

02:26.771 --> 02:30.154
Her maiden name is Zella, Z-E-L-L-E.

02:32.007 --> 02:38.133
And her married name is McLeod, M-C, capital L-E-O-D.

02:38.293 --> 02:40.935
And these all appear in these documents, too.

02:40.955 --> 02:46.260
And this document, her visa application, is all in her own handwriting.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.043
Well, it's a friend document.

02:50.063 --> 02:52.366
It's a friend document.

02:52.386 --> 02:55.749
It wouldn't... It's a curiosa, really.

02:55.769 --> 02:58.291
They should tell you what that cost me.

02:58.311 --> 02:59.432
Dave was a good friend.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.903
I think I paid $20.

03:01.923 --> 03:02.624
Come on.

03:02.644 --> 03:05.749
Yeah.

03:06.390 --> 03:23.474
On a more serious note over there in that blue solid case on that same shelf, the original manuscripts for a wonderful World War II story, true story, which you know is The Man Who Never Was by Ewan Martin.

03:23.494 --> 03:23.995
Oh, yeah, that's famous.

03:24.516 --> 03:28.221
The Flurry of the Body on the shore of Spain.

03:29.635 --> 03:34.341
Uh, those are Ewan's original manuscripts, which I got.

03:34.761 --> 03:39.907
He was a good friend of mine, and he was the case officer for the operation.

03:43.792 --> 03:48.398
There are all sorts of interesting little things here.

03:51.381 --> 03:55.927
And—just like that?

03:55.947 --> 03:57.088
Yep.

03:57.108 --> 03:59.271
Uh— May I follow you?

03:59.639 --> 04:29.207
This book here, The Memoirs of Secret Service by Matthew Smith, 1699, is

04:29.693 --> 04:36.562
From my standpoint, the first book in English completely devoted to an intelligence operation or two.

04:40.567 --> 04:45.974
I have here an inscribed copy from Matthew Smith, the Lord High Chancellor of England.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.040
Wow.

04:51.441 --> 04:55.245
You were serious at this point.

04:55.265 --> 04:56.046
Yes.

04:56.066 --> 04:58.890
But I consider that the cornerstone book.

05:00.102 --> 05:02.164
That's the base soundbook of this collection.

05:02.424 --> 05:10.932
The conscribed copy, I think, as I recall it, came to me through one of those lovely cooperations in librarians.

05:15.176 --> 05:29.670
When the acquisitions chief of the Folger Library wrote and said they weren't interested in buying it, but she thought for sure I might and was rushing the catalog over to me to buy it if I wanted, and I did.

05:30.325 --> 05:32.167
Is this Mata Hari, by the way?

05:32.447 --> 05:33.348
This is Mata Hari.

05:33.388 --> 05:34.910
This is a contemporary photograph.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.291
There are two pictures over here.

05:36.331 --> 05:39.554
Well, it's the same picture.

05:39.574 --> 05:41.777
There's a story behind the other.

05:41.797 --> 05:42.938
But this is the original.

05:44.459 --> 05:59.134
And when you're collecting books in America, American intelligence, I consider the foundation book the proceedings of a board of general officers respecting Major John Andre,

06:00.160 --> 06:04.969
That is the full title of that book.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.732
Yeah, right.

06:08.455 --> 06:23.502
This is the Board of General offices convened by General Washington to consider what to do with John Andre on the Washington news.

06:25.372 --> 06:27.455
The board found Andre was a spy.

06:27.515 --> 06:37.189
He is, of course, the case officer, not a spy ever, the case officer in the defection of Benedict Arnold at West Point.

06:37.210 --> 06:40.274
It was just a book written about him about a year or two ago.

06:42.537 --> 06:45.642
Yeah, I'll be back again.

06:45.682 --> 06:48.446
I'm sorry, I'll check this out for something else.

06:48.466 --> 06:49.708
Lotta Harry was a pretty nice-looking woman, wasn't he?

06:50.515 --> 06:53.959
I didn't realize that was, uh, what we'd call a bush shot.

06:54.820 --> 07:01.827
Well, uh, the fact is that you don't get pictures normally of Manna Harry in the nude.

07:01.847 --> 07:01.987
Uh-huh.

07:02.007 --> 07:05.511
She always has a brassiere and these two damn little anklets.

07:05.531 --> 07:05.671
Uh-huh.

07:05.691 --> 07:06.893
Anything else you can have.

07:08.134 --> 07:13.279
Uh, so, uh, these are the famous veils from which she danced her.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.041
Yeah, yeah.

07:15.061 --> 07:19.486
There are seven of them, or however many, and so forth.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.387
But, uh,

07:23.911 --> 07:27.116
She's a curiosa, really, in the business.

07:27.136 --> 07:29.880
Well, but she certainly rounds out the— Rounds out?

07:29.940 --> 07:30.662
Is that the phrase?

07:30.922 --> 07:33.005
What's the Soviet have?

07:33.025 --> 07:34.808
Oh, that was made here.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.212
Oh, okay.

07:37.392 --> 07:40.016
There's something you don't normally see.

07:40.076 --> 07:45.024
That's a manganese module from the bottom of the Pacific.

07:45.285 --> 07:46.747
They're worth something.

07:46.807 --> 07:49.591
What procession is it?

07:49.611 --> 07:50.593
It's a manganese module.

07:51.907 --> 07:57.715
used Glomar Explorer, made in Voyage, in 1974.

07:57.735 --> 08:03.924
Well, that wasn't— The Glomar's job was to get all these minerals from the bottom of the ocean.

08:03.944 --> 08:04.304
Indeed.

08:04.344 --> 08:05.205
That's what it said.

08:05.266 --> 08:06.147
I read it in the paper.

08:06.167 --> 08:06.627
Aha.

08:08.891 --> 08:12.195
There's the launching metal for the Glomar.

08:12.215 --> 08:17.042
You know, you get all these things when— Well, did you work on the Glomar project?

08:17.803 --> 08:17.863
No.

08:18.755 --> 08:20.097
What could I do?

08:20.197 --> 08:24.241
Is that from, is that manganese thing from that particular site?

08:25.283 --> 08:25.903
No, no.

08:25.943 --> 08:27.025
This is the Maidenvoid.

08:27.405 --> 08:27.545
Okay.

08:27.565 --> 08:31.971
Well, they were testing it as a mining ship, really.

08:32.832 --> 08:32.932
Yeah.

08:32.952 --> 08:33.272
Testing it.

08:33.853 --> 08:38.638
But there are all sorts of odds that end here in the collection.

08:38.658 --> 08:41.021
The collection is about five thousand dollars.

08:41.041 --> 08:44.525
Um, it's going to Yale, you said?

08:44.685 --> 08:47.549
It's going to Yale.

08:47.649 --> 08:47.749
Okay.

08:48.640 --> 08:54.469
There are a group of books there, about 65, 70 books down there on the bottom shelf.

08:54.489 --> 09:11.236
Those books, very high to come by in this country, are the books produced by the students in the bazaars of Tehran from the captured documents captured in the U.S.

09:11.337 --> 09:13.280
Embassy in September 79.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.964
That's what these books got here.

09:16.973 --> 09:28.445
There are now sixty-eight volumes of them, and they produce the original document in English and a Farsi translation.

09:29.506 --> 09:33.269
What you're telling me then is that the collection continues to grow.

09:33.710 --> 09:36.813
That's why you see it on the floor instead of on the shelves.

09:36.853 --> 09:38.054
I don't know where it's going to go.

09:38.074 --> 09:40.537
Yeah, but I mean you continue to work at it.

09:40.637 --> 09:43.740
One of us has got to quit.

09:44.480 --> 09:52.072
I think after I get through the next edition of the bibliography for the Defense Intelligence College, I may ease it up a little.

09:52.152 --> 09:59.684
Is this bibliography something I can obtain by contacting the... Just write the... I wrote down, yeah.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.547
Just write and ask for a copy.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.890
They're getting scared.

10:02.910 --> 10:05.113
I think there are 14,000 copies of it.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.836
It's free, though.

10:06.956 --> 10:07.437
Great.

10:08.599 --> 10:09.620
Do they have a phone number?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.263
Yeah.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.848
I don't know what that got in here.

10:14.068 --> 10:15.930
Well, I wrote that address down there.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.372
Yeah, that's a zip code.

10:18.592 --> 10:26.219
Because you have a forward in there, which might be useful to me.

10:27.340 --> 10:28.101
Oh, right now.

10:28.241 --> 10:30.323
There we go.

10:30.343 --> 10:31.304
Three-seven-three.

10:32.505 --> 10:33.606
Three-seven-three.

10:33.886 --> 10:34.426
Something.

10:34.687 --> 10:35.267
Something.

10:35.367 --> 10:38.570
But it's the Defense Intelligence College, which must be listed, right?

10:39.391 --> 10:40.592
Yeah.

10:42.395 --> 10:52.647
But writing bibliography, you know, there's no charm to that.

10:52.667 --> 11:01.978
Yeah, but you have created, the bibliography on this subject is basically what you decide it's going to be.

11:02.158 --> 11:04.941
Well, there are two or three of us who can do it.

11:04.981 --> 11:08.225
One of the best, of course, is George Constantinides.

11:09.767 --> 11:11.929
A fellow Greek.

11:13.293 --> 11:14.234
I'm awfully good at it.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.277
This is the best commercially available.

11:17.978 --> 11:25.285
Intelligence and Espionage, Colon, and Analytical Bibliography by George C. Constantinides.

11:25.485 --> 11:34.635
Z-O-N-S-T-A-N-T-I-N-I-D-E-S, Constantinides.

11:34.655 --> 11:39.560
And Russ Boren's collection, which is big and mess, is a little different.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.743
It's a little broader than mine.

11:43.313 --> 11:46.938
And he doesn't go in for first editions and manuscripts and stuff.

11:47.599 --> 11:49.241
Yours is a collector's collection.

11:49.261 --> 11:50.683
Mine is a collector's collection.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.867
Russ would just soon have a Xerox copy.

11:54.248 --> 11:55.950
He's looking for information.

11:55.970 --> 11:56.491
That's right.

11:56.711 --> 12:00.616
And his collection has now been given to Georgetown Library.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.739
His name is what?

12:03.060 --> 12:05.883
Colonel Russell J. Bowen, B-O-W-E-N.

12:05.903 --> 12:10.890
The collection is in the Lawinger Library at Georgetown University.

12:13.300 --> 12:19.449
We're all three very good friends, fortunately, so we're not cutting anyone's heart out.

12:20.951 --> 12:38.056
But as an archive, when a collection goes to an institution such as Yale, clearly the idea is to support scholarship, and what do you feel you are giving to the scholarly community here?

12:38.076 --> 12:43.223
What will scholars be able to glean from

12:44.266 --> 13:13.311
depending what angle they're going in from, they will find books in English, virtually all the collection is in English, on what is now the profession of intelligence and its role in national security policies of the government.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.942
That's one aspect of it.

13:16.962 --> 13:21.927
Where does intelligence fit into all this overall security picture?

13:23.868 --> 13:29.774
There are some who worry about, can you have intelligence in a democracy?

13:29.794 --> 13:32.997
And there are books and chapters on that sort of thing.

13:34.599 --> 13:40.484
The growth and building of Central Intelligence Agency is here.

13:40.704 --> 13:43.467
And then there are countless books.

13:44.054 --> 13:59.748
of memoirs by intelligence officers, clandestine collectors or spies if you prefer, covert action, whatever aspects you may be looking for.

13:59.768 --> 14:13.960
Now, strangely enough, these outside groups like the Association of Foreign Intelligence Officers and the National Intelligence Study Center were first looking at the question of

14:14.783 --> 14:44.318
teaching intelligence in the United States, universities and colleges, they found that there were about, stretching it, I'd say about 25 courses, either seminars in intelligence or segments of courses in international affairs, political science, with intelligence segments in it.

14:45.580 --> 15:11.903
Today, Afio, of which I served as chairman for two years, is in touch with about 200 professors who are teaching some aspect of this business and whom we can help by bibliographical assistance, sending them good books.

15:12.743 --> 15:14.625
Ninety percent of these books are

15:14.808 --> 15:17.491
Dreadful.

15:17.511 --> 15:20.755
But at least I have to read them to know the good from the bad.

15:20.775 --> 15:22.097
Sure.

15:22.117 --> 15:24.219
Whether it's going to bibliography or not.

15:25.821 --> 15:32.849
Or they've got nuggets and you've got to know your business well enough to know what the nuggets are and what the junk is.

15:32.869 --> 15:40.538
Now, Alan Dulles, when he was Director of Central Intelligence, was an avid reader.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.443
And he used to go crazy if I dropped it.

15:45.048 --> 15:53.958
brought into the executive dining room something that I'd just acquired, like a Washington letter or a first edition of this or that.

15:54.038 --> 16:01.927
He was going, hey, and he used to say to me, what is the state of the CIA library on intelligence?

16:03.289 --> 16:06.593
And I said, Alan, you don't have one.

16:06.613 --> 16:08.195
And they didn't.

16:08.215 --> 16:13.421
They had a few books here and there, handful.

16:13.441 --> 16:14.582
And that made him mad.

16:15.845 --> 16:39.376
And finally, after ten years as legislative council, longer than which one doesn't serve or die, he said, I mean, I want you to build a collection in the agency on all aspects of the intelligence profession, since the beginning of time to the latest book.

16:39.396 --> 16:44.383
So he basically made you a curator, a de facto curator.

16:44.566 --> 16:47.752
in all languages from the beginning of time.

16:47.932 --> 16:48.774
With a budget?

16:50.036 --> 16:53.242
With a budget.

16:53.262 --> 17:01.477
And we established the Historical Intelligence Collection in the agency, with me as curator, and that was the title.

17:04.582 --> 17:08.970
And I sat in that job for many, many years in addition to other duties.

17:10.334 --> 17:12.797
So it was kind of a collateral duty, as we used to say.

17:12.997 --> 17:24.012
Well, it was the main duty, and the collaterals forced me to travel abroad from time to time, and I could also collect books on the side for the agency.

17:24.092 --> 17:26.896
How would you rate their collection then?

17:26.916 --> 17:32.423
When I left, having started virtually from scratch, they had about 21,000 bodies.

17:33.224 --> 17:35.667
It's bigger now.

17:36.102 --> 17:36.903
First editions?

17:37.163 --> 17:37.704
No.

17:37.864 --> 17:38.825
No, no, no.

17:38.925 --> 17:47.034
Obviously not, but they weren't acquiring for the sake of building a collection, but mainly to build a resource library.

17:47.054 --> 17:47.514
That's right.

17:47.534 --> 17:52.139
Allen looked at it as something for training purposes, for the study of precedents.

17:52.860 --> 17:56.203
So you've had to develop again the bibliography.

17:56.223 --> 17:59.747
Well, in effect, the card catalog is the bibliography.

18:00.436 --> 18:07.725
But it was about 21,000 volumes when I retired in 1974.

18:09.007 --> 18:09.787
It's bigger now.

18:10.168 --> 18:13.312
It still goes on now.

18:13.332 --> 18:19.039
And it's been very useful.

18:19.059 --> 18:19.299
I would say.

18:19.319 --> 18:22.003
How much did they love to have your intellectual now?

18:22.023 --> 18:24.486
Well, they make noises, but they get their hands slapped.

18:24.506 --> 18:25.667
They know they're not going to get it.

18:26.052 --> 18:27.594
A lot of people made noises.

18:27.614 --> 18:31.858
Hoover Institute made noises.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.420
They can't have it.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.982
It's going to Yale, period, the end.

18:43.011 --> 18:45.594
Oh, I'd give the collection out there.

18:46.114 --> 18:54.203
Oh, I'd give them a copy of the Washington letter, or they'd make a copy for themselves.

18:54.723 --> 18:58.908
where I thought it was appropriate for them to have it, you know.

18:59.529 --> 19:00.350
Sure.

19:00.370 --> 19:06.458
I was a spy in the swamps for the Indians, so I wouldn't bother you, you know.

19:09.522 --> 19:10.303
That's funny.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.166
Now, what sort of questions do you have, if any?

19:13.386 --> 19:18.713
I think, believe it or not, we've covered most of it.

19:18.733 --> 19:21.777
I've just only had to direct you really, I guess,

19:21.993 --> 19:28.783
I'd kind of like to know personally your attraction to intelligence as a profession.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.125
Oh, boy.

19:30.185 --> 19:31.948
Maybe just a rumination on that.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.312
Well, I'd put it this way.

19:34.532 --> 19:38.418
Of course, when I started, I didn't know for nothing.

19:38.438 --> 19:42.945
I wasn't the only rare book man at the intelligence school in Harrisburg, by the way, when I got there.

19:43.386 --> 19:45.188
I believe that.

19:45.208 --> 19:50.937
There was a registrar named Professor

19:52.064 --> 19:57.691
I guess he was a major then—Ted Hillis from Yale.

19:59.213 --> 20:08.684
There was another staff member named Arthur A. Holton—I've forgotten Arthur's rank at the time—who came out of the— Pretty fair collection.

20:08.704 --> 20:14.792
Chief of—well, he was actually the head of the Red Book Room at the Library of Congress when he went into the service.

20:15.412 --> 20:16.354
Did you know Arthur?

20:16.374 --> 20:17.976
Yeah.

20:17.996 --> 20:20.619
Any insight on why he stopped collecting?

20:20.639 --> 20:20.839
No.

20:21.663 --> 20:23.565
He's a strange man, I think.

20:23.585 --> 20:30.534
When I say I knew him, you know, at the Gretaire Club, how are you today, or the rare book collectors gathering.

20:30.554 --> 20:47.856
Roger Stoddard at Harvard suggests that it would be just as interesting, and he never mentioned Colton, but I think maybe he was a—this is while Arthur was still alive, but he said, you know, I'd be just as interested in why some people stopped collecting his stuff.

20:47.876 --> 20:51.400
I think Arthur got the impression that his kid Stoddard was crazy.

20:52.325 --> 20:54.868
Well, not when they saw the results of the sales, though.

20:55.069 --> 20:55.870
Well, that's right.

20:55.890 --> 20:58.794
That enabled them to buy more horses.

20:58.814 --> 21:04.361
But what you do with these dirty old books are quite a sacred thing of space and money.

21:04.381 --> 21:06.044
I think there was no follow-on.

21:06.524 --> 21:19.682
Just as I'm the only member of this generation of four-timers who have any interest in books, other than because you're sitting on top of the Proud's library not knowing what's in it.

21:20.692 --> 21:26.458
I'm the only second generation of the collecting Fort Samuels to follow up.

21:27.138 --> 21:33.024
Roger Stoddard, I think he's been shafted at Harvard.

21:33.144 --> 21:35.206
You're not the only one?

21:35.226 --> 21:36.307
Including Roger.

21:36.508 --> 21:39.130
Roger's a very decent man who wouldn't complain.

21:39.350 --> 21:44.516
No, but having Larry Dowler drops on top of you?

21:44.536 --> 21:47.779
At least we got him out of Beineken.

21:47.859 --> 21:48.960
Roger's a wonderful man.

21:49.312 --> 21:53.858
He's a good guy, right?

21:53.878 --> 21:53.978
Yeah.

21:53.998 --> 21:54.779
He's helped me a lot, I can tell you.

21:56.001 --> 22:13.924
Well, one of the things of cooperation between libraries, for instance, when I made a deal with Bill Jackson and, more importantly, later with Bill Bond, I don't collect material on the Dreyfus case, which is a major, major SNI case.

22:13.944 --> 22:15.065
What?

22:15.085 --> 22:15.606
Dreyfus case.

22:16.818 --> 22:18.820
Yeah, but why don't you collect it?

22:18.840 --> 22:22.444
Because the great collection is at Harvard.

22:22.464 --> 22:26.508
This is a world-shaking collection.

22:26.528 --> 22:35.577
And I'm not going into an auction room with the thought that I don't know that the other dealer bidding over there is fitting for Harvard.

22:35.838 --> 22:38.260
Roger claims he doesn't have a lot of money to play with.

22:38.861 --> 22:43.045
Yeah, I think there was no endowment with the collection when it came from the lawyer I think.

22:43.565 --> 22:50.473
But in any event, I told him I would not buy or certainly not buy without checking to find out if Harvard was going to be in.

22:50.493 --> 22:52.035
He's quite envious of Beinecke.

22:52.055 --> 22:54.398
He said, we don't have a Beinecke in Ireland.

22:54.418 --> 22:56.480
We don't have a Beinecke family.

22:56.640 --> 23:01.726
Well, a lot of that's now pretty well finished except for the trust funds.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.192
Eddie Beinecke was quite a great personal friend of mine.

23:06.212 --> 23:12.559
We used to go fishing down the islands together.

23:12.961 --> 23:16.365
a great fellow carrying out his father's wishes.

23:17.186 --> 23:24.614
And Bill Bonnicki was fine, but quite differently, and he is not using much of his money for the library.

23:24.634 --> 23:27.177
Other things at Yale interest him more at the moment.

23:27.197 --> 23:39.171
When, just to jump completely off track, like I mentioned to you earlier when we were chatting downstairs, that one of my chapters will be on the University of Texas.

23:40.147 --> 23:58.611
What some people might say was the, not indiscreet certainly, but when they acquired from 58 to 73, they spent millions of dollars to play with and they bought everything in sight.

23:58.631 --> 24:03.818
Some people might say, some people have suggested they bought perhaps some worthless things.

24:03.838 --> 24:05.580
I think that's probably true.

24:05.881 --> 24:09.186
But then I've heard other people say, well, you know, Beinecke almost did the same thing.

24:09.226 --> 24:14.593
They almost did the same thing at Yale, but it's an Ivy League school that never got the attention of Texas.

24:14.613 --> 24:16.556
Have you ever heard that suggested?

24:16.576 --> 24:17.998
No, never.

24:18.118 --> 24:20.822
Did Yale buy at a very aggressive level?

24:21.002 --> 24:21.082
No.

24:21.162 --> 24:24.567
I mean, are they buying, say, just below what Texas was trying to do?

24:24.607 --> 24:24.827
No.

24:25.909 --> 24:27.691
No.

24:27.712 --> 24:27.772
No.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.995
That's a very unfair assertion.

24:30.055 --> 24:34.521
Well, for instance, I know when Texas bought the poor-time or Gutenberg Bible,

24:36.425 --> 24:48.721
There was a lot of ill will on the faculty for spending two million, too, on a book, which could have been better used, they thought, for faculty salaries and all that sort of thing.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.724
That was quite expressed.

24:50.744 --> 24:54.629
And there was some of that when Beinecke was being built.

24:54.949 --> 24:59.395
I remember a major figure in the Yale Law School.

25:02.632 --> 25:04.114
May have been the dean.

25:04.134 --> 25:21.832
No, it's the guy who went out to Stanford, professor, who came and addressed these law school alumni down here once and was very scornful of this goddamn building going up next door because the Yale Law Library wanted to put its stacks in there.

25:21.852 --> 25:29.320
And excavations were made and concreted and so forth so that they could put some of their stacks under the Beinecke.

25:30.221 --> 25:32.183
But the Beinecke family wouldn't pay for it.

25:33.563 --> 25:35.446
And he was very angry about that.

25:35.566 --> 25:39.673
Here he was, wasting his money on his goddamn edifice with rare books in it.

25:39.693 --> 25:47.727
When we need SPAC space and don't have the funds, they've shored up the land for us and concreted it.

25:49.029 --> 25:50.712
But they will pay for it.

25:50.732 --> 25:51.914
And there was that sort of thing.

25:51.934 --> 25:56.382
And I talked to the dean of Lewoska at the time, and I said, shut him up, and shut him up quick.

25:56.767 --> 25:59.531
And he'd never open his yap again.

26:00.132 --> 26:07.742
I think aesthetically, the Beinecke is about the most beautiful rare book structure I've seen, and I've really been traveling to all of them.

26:08.723 --> 26:09.625
It's lovely.

26:09.685 --> 26:14.551
Have you ever heard any criticism, though, that it's exposed to light?

26:14.571 --> 26:19.498
Well, I've got that tinted windows and all.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.643
Light is bad for books, we know that.

26:23.143 --> 26:26.588
Well, I think it's handled in such a way as not to be a problem.

26:27.395 --> 26:34.405
We're putting a lot of money and time at Yale now into conservation.

26:34.425 --> 26:36.929
That is one thing that Texas does, really.

26:37.389 --> 26:39.693
You know, they kind of lead the pack on that.

26:39.713 --> 26:42.096
Texas does a wonderful thing in conservation.

26:42.116 --> 26:50.268
I have to give Decker Turner, that's his big contribution, I think, to that conservation department.

26:50.448 --> 26:51.890
I think we've covered quite a bit here.

26:52.952 --> 26:55.275
You're a nickel.

26:56.234 --> 27:05.568
I think, if you don't mind, if there are any other questions, I'll call you at some point, now that we've met.

27:05.769 --> 27:06.690
How useful is this?

27:06.810 --> 27:08.733
Oh, I can assure you it's wonderful.

27:08.773 --> 27:14.462
You talked about intelligence as a profession.

27:15.387 --> 27:19.532
It will be called the Walter Forstheimer Collection?

27:19.552 --> 27:23.377
I call this the Walter Forstheimer Collection on intelligence service.

27:23.397 --> 27:23.497
Okay.

27:23.517 --> 27:29.905
And I'm sure that when Yale gets it, it'll— It'll be still known as the spy collection, I know.

27:29.925 --> 27:31.366
They want the money and the money.

27:31.386 --> 27:33.209
They don't do a damn budget.

27:33.229 --> 27:33.709
You think?

27:34.070 --> 27:35.732
Excuse me, maybe.

27:37.013 --> 27:37.994
They could do without it.

27:38.054 --> 27:39.937
They'd be happiest planned.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.779
Except for a writing letter or two.

27:41.799 --> 27:42.660
Oh, yeah.

27:43.332 --> 27:46.496
But I think you've made it pretty clear that it comes as a collection.

27:46.516 --> 27:47.177
That is correct.

27:48.238 --> 27:49.340
Otherwise it doesn't go there.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.702
That's correct.

27:50.722 --> 27:54.446
And they've given you a—because I've seen collections that have been broken up.

27:54.466 --> 27:55.708
Yes, correct.

27:55.728 --> 28:01.816
Well, this will be broken up only to the extent that the manuscript parts go to the manuscript collection.

28:03.278 --> 28:07.603
Archivally, they can't toss these things on the shelves.

28:07.623 --> 28:11.308
And then the books will stay together.

28:11.328 --> 28:11.989
That's important.

28:13.150 --> 28:13.911
I would think so.

28:14.752 --> 28:15.412
I would think so.

28:16.213 --> 28:23.261
You see, one of the problems is that a lot of these books are duplicated in Yale's normal college library stack.

28:23.281 --> 28:26.184
Sure, Cloak and Gowl, for instance, has got to be there.

28:26.204 --> 28:30.348
Cloak and Gowl will be there because of Robin, but you get Truman's memoirs.

28:32.350 --> 28:41.520
I couldn't care less about Truman as President of the United States except that he is the man who established CIA.

28:42.226 --> 28:46.853
has written about it in his memoirs, and some other things in his memoirs.

28:47.173 --> 28:48.235
Same way with de Gaulle.

28:48.275 --> 28:56.266
I don't care about de Gaulle, except that he had these tremendous dealings with the French Resistance.

28:56.867 --> 29:01.114
I think you showed me—oh, yeah, one other question.

29:01.214 --> 29:05.199
Is there anything that you think the collection lacks?

29:05.780 --> 29:08.765
Do you have a want list?

29:09.105 --> 29:11.068
Basically, do you— You're an archivist.

29:12.803 --> 29:13.964
I'm sorry, which?

29:13.984 --> 29:17.227
Girl archivists.

29:17.368 --> 29:18.729
I've never made a warrant list.

29:19.750 --> 29:25.636
Oh, maybe if I'm in a bookstore I know and have a title written, but not really.

29:28.119 --> 29:38.389
A warrant list, A, it's hard to make, and B, you really run into diminishing returns.

29:38.605 --> 29:42.250
I mean, for instance, there is no post Tamerlane in Massachusetts, you know.

29:42.270 --> 29:43.672
I mean, Harvard doesn't have any.

29:43.692 --> 29:45.555
Well, they could have had Bradley's.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.898
Well, yeah, they could have, you know, $150K.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.662
Bill Self bought it out in L.A.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.946
In fact, I'm going to see him out in L.A.

29:52.966 --> 29:53.887
He's a producer.

29:53.907 --> 30:04.682
There's a tremendous amount of stuff in the Martin Collection from a pair out in Chicago named, I think, Greenhill.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.946
Never heard of them.

30:06.966 --> 30:08.528
All sorts of stuff in there.

30:08.913 --> 30:11.435
Don't know who they are.

30:11.596 --> 30:15.800
Ralph Newman bought a lot of stuff.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.481
He got the Declaration of Independence.

30:17.501 --> 30:18.362
Oh, is that what he bought?

30:18.382 --> 30:19.383
He bought something right there.

30:19.403 --> 30:23.647
He bought a few other things, but he bought a 1.5 he spent for that.

30:24.028 --> 30:29.653
He showed up that day in a red, white and blue striped shirt and a bow tie.

30:31.415 --> 30:34.038
I think I pretty well covered it.

30:34.478 --> 30:35.499
So you don't have a want list.

30:35.519 --> 30:37.401
There were no glaring omissions here.

30:37.583 --> 30:42.150
Oh, there are things running through my head that I could use, yeah.

30:42.170 --> 30:48.038
But the most interesting things are things I really don't know about and will turn up.

30:48.239 --> 30:52.745
Are you going to see it go to Yale, or it will go?

30:55.369 --> 30:55.990
I'll go first.

30:59.275 --> 31:03.321
But they want the money, or gosh, they don't care.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.617
But you're a good lawyer that you are.

31:05.677 --> 31:08.740
I'm sure you've taken care of... Yeah, okay.

31:09.961 --> 31:15.205
Take something as mundane as the Warren Commission report.

31:15.225 --> 31:15.366
Uh-huh.

31:15.446 --> 31:17.407
That's a modern book now, you said.

31:17.708 --> 31:18.028
Yeah.

31:18.088 --> 31:19.489
You don't even have a dust jacket on it.

31:19.509 --> 31:20.730
No.

31:20.750 --> 31:21.771
GPO printed.

31:22.412 --> 31:25.475
But each member of the Warren Commission got 15 copies.

31:26.796 --> 31:31.840
And each one signed all of them.

31:31.860 --> 31:32.481
There you have it.

31:33.406 --> 31:35.369
And there I have it.

31:35.389 --> 31:50.594
But this is—and I've seen copies of this floating around second-hand book fairs at 600 bucks—but this is what you call an association copy.

31:50.614 --> 31:53.038
And it's to Walter.

31:53.158 --> 31:58.587
I take great pleasure in sending you this copy of the Warren Commission report.

31:59.242 --> 32:02.546
signed by each of the members of the Commission, signed by whom?

32:02.707 --> 32:03.267
Alan Dulles.

32:03.508 --> 32:06.031
Alan Dulles, 10 February, 65.

32:06.051 --> 32:06.912
Actually, he didn't send it.

32:06.932 --> 32:12.941
He brought it over for—brought over a cocktail for him.

32:13.601 --> 32:15.444
He said, let's have a drink.

32:15.464 --> 32:25.097
And then we asked the Russians, you know, whether we couldn't translate the Commission report, whether they were allowed to be distributed in the Soviet Union.

32:26.157 --> 32:33.825
So USIA had the thing translated into Russian, printed up, I think, 1100 copies.

32:33.845 --> 32:38.429
And the Russians went to now, which ain't no mind hailed it.

32:38.449 --> 32:44.375
So in a warehouse somewhere in this town, there are 1099 copies of the damn thing in Russia.

32:44.395 --> 32:45.576
And there's the stairs.

32:46.237 --> 32:47.358
Is it signed by anybody?

32:47.518 --> 32:47.718
No.

32:49.380 --> 32:49.560
No.

32:50.681 --> 32:50.801
Salad.

32:51.422 --> 32:54.645
These two shells just deal with me.

32:54.946 --> 33:02.777
Warren Commission Report, and Intelligence, accusing us of assassinating him or the FBI of assassinating him.

33:02.897 --> 33:08.785
Any scurrilous novel like the Three Days of the Condor, you know, which— I'm in that.

33:08.805 --> 33:09.306
You're in that?

33:09.366 --> 33:10.628
Yeah.

33:10.688 --> 33:11.048
How so?

33:11.068 --> 33:14.893
Well, I guess that's the way it was written about it.

33:14.913 --> 33:21.122
This is the guy who keeps the library—the agency collection on Intelligence.

33:22.047 --> 33:27.152
He keeps it in the house up on Capitol Hill and manipulates it.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.715
Are you the bad guy in the book?

33:30.035 --> 33:32.138
I'm the guy who keeps the collection.

33:32.158 --> 33:33.519
I made the collection.

33:33.539 --> 33:34.520
In the book, in the novel?

33:35.181 --> 33:37.063
Well, also in the novel, yeah.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.625
But I made it for the agency, originally.

33:39.645 --> 33:41.487
That's the collection I set up.

33:41.507 --> 33:47.614
The collection that— The historical intelligence collection.

33:47.654 --> 33:51.818
That forms the premise of Three Days of the Fund.

33:52.895 --> 33:55.698
But I mean, do you have things like that in your collection?

33:55.858 --> 34:06.609
There are about 20 shelves of fiction downstairs, but I don't like fiction, television fiction, no professional does, really, basically.

34:06.629 --> 34:14.177
And so, they're there, but they're written by friends of mine.

34:14.638 --> 34:18.902
I'm going to rosy on.

34:19.692 --> 34:21.514
Yeah, I'm taking too much of your time.

34:21.534 --> 34:22.235
Are you kidding?

34:22.255 --> 34:23.096
This is wonderful.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.280
I'm glad to see you have a secure place here.

34:26.340 --> 34:30.906
You see, please, I'll carry on you by the reference collection.

34:30.926 --> 34:31.507
Carry on that.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.469
Okay.

34:33.489 --> 34:37.674
All of that is Moliere reference.

34:37.694 --> 34:41.539
It's even shelved up to the Fs and carded up to the Ns.

34:41.559 --> 34:46.485
My father's cards are pretty good, but the stuff I've added, of course, I just hung that tiny.

34:48.528 --> 34:49.429
That is wonderful.

34:49.645 --> 34:57.394
And these are all modern editions of what the hell do you have to do with them in my family.

34:57.414 --> 34:58.335
These little ones.

34:58.435 --> 35:00.537
Yeah, those are contemporary.

35:02.640 --> 35:13.712
But you've got some of this stuff goes back to the 70s.

35:14.536 --> 35:22.846
I've heard somewhere that you moved to the Watergate mainly because you needed quarters large enough to house the library.

35:22.906 --> 35:25.229
That's apocryphal, right?

35:27.431 --> 35:41.488
I wanted a better apartment, a swimming pool, a hotel coming up with a dining room so I can go over and eat.

35:41.806 --> 35:49.314
I want to point out that there are books just stacked all over the place on the deck here on the floor.

35:49.374 --> 35:52.117
Perhaps three or four hundred books, I would estimate.

35:52.638 --> 35:53.599
Don't rub it in.

35:54.059 --> 35:56.062
Well, you should see my house.

35:56.082 --> 35:59.085
But there are two apartments here, you see.

35:59.445 --> 36:00.406
I don't sleep here.

36:00.707 --> 36:04.010
I sleep in the other apartment on the other wing where I sleep.

36:04.191 --> 36:06.173
So this is just where you work and live?

36:06.193 --> 36:07.414
Yeah.

36:07.434 --> 36:11.779
I mean, I'm not working— Well, I entertain you.

36:13.244 --> 36:21.476
Since this was a hole in the ground when I bought it, the floors have been specially reinforced with concrete and steel.

36:22.177 --> 36:22.517
Really?

36:23.338 --> 36:23.459
Yeah.

36:23.479 --> 36:24.981
So this was built to your specs?

36:25.001 --> 36:25.642
Yeah.

36:25.662 --> 36:26.403
Oh, yeah.

36:26.423 --> 36:28.105
These are two bedrooms.

36:28.145 --> 36:31.410
So you go back to the beginning of the complex.

36:31.470 --> 36:32.051
That's right.

36:32.071 --> 36:34.775
You were here when the disquietude took place, I gather.

36:35.496 --> 36:38.340
Yeah, I was—I was the—

36:39.653 --> 36:43.798
head of the board security committee at the time, ran that show.

36:43.818 --> 36:45.340
I'm glad that must have been something.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.281
That was nothing.

36:46.301 --> 36:46.862
It was amusing.

36:46.982 --> 36:51.047
As long as you didn't have anything to do with it, it was amusing.

36:51.408 --> 36:53.570
Oh, you mean when my friends hopped in there?

36:53.590 --> 36:53.691
Yeah.

36:54.051 --> 36:54.972
That's another story.

36:55.012 --> 36:58.537
You'll be interested in that, but I'll look for that thing.

36:58.557 --> 36:59.958
Okay.

36:59.978 --> 37:01.620
I was Danny Gibson, Stockton.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.066
We're walking down the stairs, and we're looking at a wonderful friend of mine.

37:08.780 --> 37:10.342
I'm a friend of mine.

37:10.362 --> 37:14.105
I've never talked about Dwight Eisenhower and George Bush.

37:14.466 --> 37:19.711
Oh, look at that.

37:19.731 --> 37:22.113
Don't trip over those wilds, man.

37:22.514 --> 37:23.855
I shouldn't.

37:23.875 --> 37:24.075
Okay.

37:24.716 --> 37:28.039
Now, there is one artist, in case you like artwork.

37:28.059 --> 37:29.381
I do, you don't know.

37:30.822 --> 37:31.983
There's one.

37:34.626 --> 37:38.550
Ah, silkscreen print by Colonel Rudolph Abel, A-B-E-L.

37:38.935 --> 37:41.438
Made while imprisoned at Atlanta Penitentiary.

37:44.561 --> 37:48.625
And this is an original painting by Dwight Eisenhower, Christmas 1960.

37:48.765 --> 37:53.110
It's extraordinary.

37:53.130 --> 37:57.955
Field of the Central Intelligence Agency.

37:57.995 --> 38:00.357
Remarkable.

38:00.397 --> 38:04.762
Washington Redskins.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.144
Okay.

38:07.164 --> 38:08.346
Colonel Abel.

38:08.446 --> 38:08.706
Colonel Abel.

38:09.091 --> 38:17.024
was what we call an illegal, a Soviet agent here, not under official cover.

38:18.486 --> 38:28.803
And part of his cover was as a commercial artist, which accounts for his, the excellence of, comparative excellence of his drawings.

38:29.845 --> 38:33.310
And he was a top Soviet agent in this country.

38:33.330 --> 38:35.554
But he never broke, and we don't know,

38:35.720 --> 38:37.782
What he did, hardly eaten at all.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.123
The Bureau went crazy.

38:39.884 --> 38:44.728
And if you go down to the Bureau and take their tour, they'll tell you how they caught Colonel Abel.

38:44.748 --> 38:47.190
But they would tell you how Colonel Abel was really caught.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.371
The Bureau gives a tour?

38:48.911 --> 38:51.213
Oh yeah, they got a big tour around there.

38:51.353 --> 38:52.174
Oh yeah?

38:52.194 --> 38:53.095
Oh yeah, artifacts.

38:53.115 --> 38:55.076
I might just have to go take it one day.

38:55.196 --> 39:00.321
But the thing about the real fact of Colonel Abel is that he had an assistant over here named Hey Hammond.

39:01.722 --> 39:04.144
Rhino Hey Hammond.

39:04.164 --> 39:05.305
And Hey Hammond,

39:06.382 --> 39:09.887
decided going back to Moscow wasn't very healthy when he was recalled.

39:11.129 --> 39:14.814
So he walked into our embassy in Paris and said, here I am, and that broke the case.

39:15.675 --> 39:16.656
How do we spell his name?

39:16.977 --> 39:17.478
Hey, Hannah?

39:19.060 --> 39:19.881
Yeah.

39:19.941 --> 39:20.622
I'll look it up.

39:20.642 --> 39:22.144
I'll tell you where you find all that.

39:22.184 --> 39:29.274
There's a book by James Donovan, not related to the general, but former general counsel of OSS.

39:30.196 --> 39:31.497
Jim Donovan and James Donovan.

39:31.517 --> 39:32.018
Another book.

39:32.038 --> 39:32.939
Strangers on a Bridge.

39:33.280 --> 39:33.360
Yep.

39:33.781 --> 39:34.081
I know.

39:34.241 --> 39:34.802
Beautiful book.

39:36.065 --> 39:36.886
Jim's gone now.

39:37.147 --> 39:39.750
He's a lovely guy.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.293
Okay, I'm going to run along, sir.

39:42.735 --> 39:45.318
How many of you guys have that picture?

39:45.338 --> 39:46.159
You don't watch it?

39:46.180 --> 39:47.221
You're teasing me.

39:47.241 --> 39:49.925
They have the writing.

39:50.005 --> 39:51.427
Those are all my problems.

39:51.447 --> 39:52.428
I collect the books.

39:54.271 --> 39:57.195
Illustrated books in Winslow Holmes and Child Passams.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.058
No, they're too long.

39:59.078 --> 40:01.261
They're too long.

40:01.341 --> 40:02.503
They're quintessential women.

40:02.663 --> 40:03.404
Well, they got them.

40:03.424 --> 40:03.945
You can't...

40:04.060 --> 40:06.915
even those that cost you a fortune, really.
