WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:03.737
415-557-4572.

00:05.019 --> 00:08.926
Good.

00:09.366 --> 00:24.773
And her home number is 415-922-5869.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.604
I definitely remember her name.

00:30.049 --> 00:37.311
I'm sure I know I met her someplace.

00:37.780 --> 00:40.945
in their rare books department.

00:40.965 --> 00:42.247
So she goes to those.

00:42.267 --> 00:48.476
I've given a lot of talks generally to friends of libraries and stuff like that.

00:48.496 --> 00:49.998
I can't remember where she said it was.

00:50.459 --> 00:53.023
It could have been at the iLab thing, which is last September.

00:53.263 --> 00:59.232
I gave a talk for the friends of the Stanford Public Library last year, and I gave one at the thing.

01:00.258 --> 01:27.835
at the uh the book fair. And I did meet a lot of people at those at those talks so it's very different. Oh I'll bet I know what it was. I gave a talk at the Roxburg Club uh in February of uh of 90s last year so I mean I gave three talks in San Francisco and I'll bet you she was there because that was all. Sounds right. Yeah that's exactly where I met her, at the Roxburg Club. Yeah I think that that could well be. It rings a bell although I'm not gonna.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.193
I don't know.

01:29.253 --> 01:30.074
No, I remember now.

01:31.415 --> 01:31.815
Oh, great.

01:31.876 --> 01:32.656
Oh, terrific.

01:33.197 --> 01:36.600
I like this story a lot.

01:37.301 --> 01:39.603
It even has links with your own stuff.

01:39.883 --> 01:51.314
And the other woman who's been kind of vocal about all this, the other librarian, is Melissa Riley.

01:51.594 --> 01:52.014
Melissa?

01:52.455 --> 01:53.476
Melissa Riley.

01:53.876 --> 01:57.940
And her number is...

01:58.392 --> 02:10.049
The number is 510-524-2155.

02:11.351 --> 02:11.771
Good.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.136
Excellent.

02:15.416 --> 02:15.777
Super.

02:16.117 --> 02:24.990
And then the people who, the other, you know, the branch librarians, she's a kind of floating branch librarian who's chosen to

02:25.882 --> 02:34.830
The other great thing about public librarians that I, you know, didn't recognize before I got involved in this is that they genuinely do believe in public service.

02:34.950 --> 02:48.721
They believe, you know, that maybe the salary is lower and things are less flashy and stuff, but you were helping people to be able to consult books.

02:49.202 --> 02:50.403
Oh, I genuinely believe that.

02:50.623 --> 02:55.467
Yeah, and so the San Francisco Public Library is this

02:55.970 --> 03:00.497
is a huge and wonderful collection that's free.

03:00.717 --> 03:09.111
It's the only collection in the region whose books you don't have to pay to see, really.

03:09.792 --> 03:16.702
Because at Cal, if you want to take out books, you have to pay a fee and join up and stuff like that.

03:17.504 --> 03:23.513
So it really is supposed to be the agent of democracy and all that good stuff.

03:23.830 --> 03:33.725
It's especially important that those librarians who are in the midst of this crazy enthusiasm have kind of said, wait a second.

03:33.745 --> 03:35.148
So what are you working on these days?

03:36.610 --> 03:49.650
I wrote a novel while I was in England, and I've written a piece that has to do with Venice for The New Yorker.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.373
Oh, nice.

03:51.539 --> 03:54.207
I'm doing the research for another novel now.

03:55.370 --> 04:01.026
You know, I write a column, a literary column, which is apart from

04:01.428 --> 04:07.895
my work on my book, and I've syndicated it in about 25 newspapers, none, unfortunately, in California.

04:08.016 --> 04:10.298
It's a tough sell getting a literary call.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.299
I'm out there, I have to say.

04:12.240 --> 04:12.661
That's too bad.

04:12.681 --> 04:13.622
That sounds great.

04:13.722 --> 04:16.645
And what I've done is target university towns.

04:16.746 --> 04:18.788
And so I'm in Eugene, Oregon.

04:18.808 --> 04:27.638
I'm in Charlottesville, Knoxville, Gainesville, Toledo, believe it or not, Columbus, Madison, Austin.

04:27.618 --> 04:29.199
Jackson, Mississippi.

04:29.259 --> 04:32.162
I mean, it sounds like an athletic league, you know, the NCAA.

04:34.224 --> 04:36.546
But, you know, I do this every week.

04:36.566 --> 04:36.646
Wow.

04:36.666 --> 04:42.591
And, in fact, I'm just finishing up on the Hermione Lee biography of Virginia Woolf, which is really, really good.

04:43.512 --> 04:44.373
I haven't seen it yet.

04:44.393 --> 04:45.714
Well, it's huge.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.536
It's 800 pages.

04:47.556 --> 04:53.701
But, you know, I'd love to do a feature on you, you know, when your next book comes out.

04:54.162 --> 04:54.983
Well, it'll be a pleasure.

04:55.023 --> 04:57.625
I mean, you know, I would

04:58.398 --> 04:58.919
Anytime.

04:59.199 --> 04:59.700
Yeah, good.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.305
Well, I mean, ideally it's when the book comes out because it helps, you know.

05:05.368 --> 05:09.154
Well, the book is not scheduled, I think, until they were going to publish it in the fall.

05:09.194 --> 05:13.340
And then I think it's now scheduled for May of next year.

05:13.420 --> 05:13.821
Oh, good.

05:14.061 --> 05:14.302
Good.

05:14.422 --> 05:14.742
Excellent.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.027
Well, you know, you're still with Random House?

05:18.310 --> 05:18.911
Yeah.

05:18.931 --> 05:19.472
Good.

05:19.492 --> 05:21.035
I know the publicist there very well.

05:21.236 --> 05:24.963
Yeah, the woman who seems to do my stuff is Layla Morrissey.

05:24.983 --> 05:25.644
Yeah, I know Layla.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.432
I know Malt, Tom Perry, and I've been doing this for 20 years.

05:29.472 --> 05:34.963
This is my... Well, anyway, that's a lot of work because every week... It is.

05:35.324 --> 05:40.133
What was so impressive about... One of the many things that was impressive about your book was the...

05:41.750 --> 05:51.220
I don't think people who haven't done this understand how difficult it is to come up with a printed, a written text based on that many hundreds of interviews.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.042
Because, you know, it's just different.

05:54.102 --> 06:04.072
It's different from working with printed sources where you kind of, someone has already made the leap from the spoken realm to the written realm.

06:04.112 --> 06:07.656
But all that, all that huge list of,

06:07.923 --> 06:09.485
interviewees at the end.

06:09.526 --> 06:11.729
I thought of a number of cassette tapes.

06:11.749 --> 06:12.670
Oh, Christ.

06:14.714 --> 06:21.104
I am now faced with, and I do my own transcriptions too, which is... Well, that's in a way that's smart.

06:21.124 --> 06:25.671
It is, because it relives the moment and the nuance comes back to you and all that stuff.

06:25.691 --> 06:30.859
And I just came back from Paris with 15 hours of tape, you know, and...

06:31.413 --> 06:34.757
And I was just looking at that stack of tapes sitting over there.

06:35.578 --> 06:38.821
But I think there were like 250 hours of tape for that book.

06:38.841 --> 06:41.184
And this new one, he's already over 100, 150.

06:41.584 --> 06:44.367
And we meant for this to be a smaller book.

06:44.407 --> 06:48.732
And you know how these things are, right?

06:48.792 --> 06:49.914
Yeah, no.

06:50.154 --> 06:59.344
Well, when you picked, it turns out, you picked a huge subject in the midst of its biggest defining moment, in a way, because all the

06:59.898 --> 07:02.881
all the libraries are going through this convulsion at the same time.

07:02.901 --> 07:04.823
And that's just part of what I'm doing, this new book.

07:04.923 --> 07:11.310
I mean, I'm trying to enter the debate on the cultural wars as they relate to texts.

07:12.030 --> 07:20.519
Try to do a chapter on bibliography and this whole scholarly concept of history of the book, you know, the Bob Darnton kinds of books.

07:21.320 --> 07:27.306
Going to do something on Sarajevo, the destruction in one night of 1.2 million books deliberately.

07:27.775 --> 07:29.518
you know, as part of ethnic cleansing.

07:29.558 --> 07:31.881
If you're going to kill the people, you have to kill their memory.

07:33.644 --> 07:52.051
Post-Soviet book culture, I'll be starting with a, and this is kind of fun, it's an excuse to travel, but kind of a pilgrimage to libraries through history, but chronologically going along, you know, the Library of Pergamum is still there, for instance, or go to St.

07:52.071 --> 07:57.259
Gall, where you had the great surviving

07:58.252 --> 08:04.100
You know, go to Monte Cassino where the rule of Benedict was formulated.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.906
Go to the library in Seville that was established by Columbus's son.

08:08.887 --> 08:16.377
And, you know, when you talk about North America, the European experience in America is totally bracketed by print.

08:16.397 --> 08:18.561
I mean, it's a totally documented history.

08:19.161 --> 08:23.347
And I don't know how you can say these little things as you're going to these libraries.

08:23.367 --> 08:23.688
I don't know.

08:23.788 --> 08:28.174
I mean, when you talk about closing a library and changing the whole concept of a library,

08:28.694 --> 08:32.379
And you even have libraries that are being built now that they don't call them that anymore.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.045
You know, they're learning resource centers, you know.

08:37.026 --> 08:41.953
And you talked the other day about, you know, what the reading room of the British Library means.

08:41.973 --> 08:47.421
I mean, it's not just a warehouse where you keep paper and, you know, and cardboard.

08:47.521 --> 08:50.426
I mean, a library is a spiritual place.

08:50.466 --> 08:51.687
It's a temple, I mean.

08:51.968 --> 08:53.650
That's so true.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.613
That sounds like a dynamite.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.870
I just hope I can handle it, that's all.

08:57.950 --> 09:01.757
I mean, I just hope I don't lose control of it.

09:02.278 --> 09:04.422
That's the only problem with it.

09:04.442 --> 09:10.954
It's funny that one of the first things you mentioned was the culture wars and stuff.

09:11.916 --> 09:16.504
There are always these incredible fuss-ups because...

09:16.788 --> 09:22.655
My friend Flicka has been removed from the shelves of a library.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.817
Oh, Nancy Drew in San Francisco.

09:24.857 --> 09:25.919
Right, right.

09:26.519 --> 09:30.984
And I can get, I suppose, upset about those things a little bit.

09:31.625 --> 09:44.500
But really, I don't think that people understand that there's a different order of magnitude of censorship going on when you remove...

09:45.155 --> 09:50.059
all the books that nobody knows about, because everybody knows about Nancy Drew and my friend Luca.

09:50.079 --> 09:55.984
It's going to be available no matter what, no matter how hostile some small town in Ohio is to it.

09:56.925 --> 09:58.667
The memory of the book is not erased.

09:58.727 --> 10:14.841
But if you remove all the books that have no defenders and have nobody who really knows that they even exist, then you're doing a kind of wholesale censorship

10:15.412 --> 10:44.102
that I think is much more damaging because it's, and that's really, that is the other fundamental difficulty with this is that if you make the analogy to, say, green battles, you know, people focus on some sub-variety of salamander and everybody kind of accepts that that,

10:44.808 --> 10:53.138
that particular park has to be saved because there are these two or three unique species there.

10:53.158 --> 11:09.778
But it's harder to make that kind of argument on the basis of 20,000 or 30,000 old books because each old book individually, it isn't probably the very last copy in existence.

11:09.878 --> 11:10.459
But it could be.

11:10.679 --> 11:13.262
It could be, and that's another.

11:14.170 --> 11:22.498
It probably isn't, and it isn't something that you can weep over on its own.

11:22.798 --> 11:42.777
But as a kind of stratum of books, of these unheralded, low-profile books that nobody knows about that are being thrown away or given away, I think that is really...

11:43.195 --> 11:50.644
No, actually, you have touched on this in your talk, in your speech, and in your article, and I am really investigating this.

11:51.265 --> 11:55.631
Because what you have and what I'm really trying to establish are policies.

11:56.312 --> 12:01.959
What policy do you apply to a book that hasn't been read?

12:01.999 --> 12:05.423
Now, at the University of Michigan, for instance, they have the what-if rule.

12:06.112 --> 12:08.501
I'm making a glossary of these things.

12:08.601 --> 12:15.345
If a book has not been called out in the past five years, for instance, it is a candidate for deaccessioning.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.109
Five-year rule there.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.471
That was University of where?

12:18.491 --> 12:18.912
Michigan.

12:19.132 --> 12:20.434
Michigan.

12:20.754 --> 12:24.280
And so they're saying, well, and the what-if rule is, well, what if somebody wants it?

12:24.300 --> 12:25.041
What do we do with it?

12:25.101 --> 12:27.986
What if somebody might want it after seven years?

12:28.527 --> 12:30.610
But they're discussing these things.

12:31.591 --> 12:33.474
Now, Harvard saves all their books.

12:33.835 --> 12:42.328
And then they have built, which I'm starting this chapter with a visit to the Harvard Depository right out here in Southboro, where they

12:42.308 --> 12:44.991
I call it the Valley of the Kings for books.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.075
And so they have these big modules.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.659
Each module can hold 2.5 million books.

12:51.679 --> 12:54.142
And they're books that nobody is calling for.

12:54.202 --> 12:59.689
But the computer says if somebody wants it, then it goes back to Cambridge within a 24-hour period.

12:59.709 --> 13:03.734
But now what a lot of people are doing, and I said, well, how many books a week do you send in to Cambridge?

13:03.754 --> 13:04.975
They said, oh, about...

13:05.157 --> 13:06.078
a hundred a week.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.661
I said, that's a lot, you know?

13:07.701 --> 13:13.070
But what's happening is that it's kind of like what you've identified at San Francisco.

13:13.110 --> 13:20.762
You've got graduate students, you've got teachers who object to certain books going off to the depository calling for them.

13:21.223 --> 13:25.690
So they're requiring them to come back to the library, you know?

13:25.870 --> 13:28.495
To show that they're used and that they're in demand.

13:28.635 --> 13:31.840
But Harvard, at least, is not getting rid of their books.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.865
Cornell is, you see.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.510
And who are their patrons?

13:35.530 --> 13:38.297
You see, you alluded to that earlier with Pacific Bell.

13:38.979 --> 13:42.268
They're getting all their equipment, all their money, all their sponsorship.

13:42.552 --> 14:04.645
from Eastman Kodak and from Xerox. Right? And Eastman Kodak is in the digital imaging. Well they're giving them the machines. Machines are there they're doing this stuff. They are basically acting as agents for these companies so they don't care about the books you know, and but Cornell they're bright. They're doing it in a I mean they're doing it in a very

14:04.625 --> 14:07.090
systematic way.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.452
They're documenting everything.

14:08.472 --> 14:12.760
And they almost challenged me when I went there to, you know, I mean, they're holding nothing back.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.742
I mean, it's very interesting.

14:15.004 --> 14:18.611
If you can get that on the page.

14:19.011 --> 14:19.592
Oh, I can get it.

14:19.613 --> 14:23.139
Then, you know, you've caught that moment in time.

14:23.159 --> 14:27.527
Oh, man.

14:28.317 --> 14:32.523
Well, it's always horrifying to hear that it's someplace like Cornell.

14:32.543 --> 14:38.732
Well, you know, they're still going to have five million books, or maybe they're going to have six million books.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.437
That makes it one of the ten largest libraries in America.

14:43.438 --> 14:50.549
They can argue, as you have argued, who needs 15 copies of Paul Samuelson's economics?

14:50.569 --> 14:55.776
There are plenty of, you know, and that's the other thing that has to be said over and over again, that

14:56.195 --> 15:26.100
weeding is part of librarianship and etc but it's just there's a whole thing going on at San Francisco now that Andrew can tell you about they're trying to formulate a reasonable weeding policy which they never had one of the things that came up in the whole lawsuit and they still haven't sent me any of those memos or documents that related to the weeding of Brooks Hall but what

15:26.435 --> 15:32.842
what's going on at, you know, whether it should be no use in five years.

15:32.902 --> 15:35.004
That's kind of, that would be a Dowlin kind of thing.

15:35.104 --> 15:36.706
That would be, sure.

15:37.046 --> 15:37.947
That's an extreme.

15:38.728 --> 15:53.623
That's really... Well, I'm not so sure it's been implemented yet, but they're discussing it, you know, and they... I think some of the rumors that I heard at San Francisco, one of which it was when they were really in the midst of this flurry at one point, the then...

15:54.245 --> 16:01.754
One of the then administrators who's since left said that, you know, think seriously about getting rid of any book published before 1920.

16:02.775 --> 16:03.215
Jesus.

16:05.097 --> 16:13.727
But the New Yorker wouldn't let me put that in because the attribution path was not.

16:13.747 --> 16:18.493
The person who reported it wasn't willing to go on the record and, you know, all that crap.

16:19.254 --> 16:20.455
But then...

16:22.780 --> 16:33.418
But there are weeding old, the 1970 weeding policies at San Francisco where, you know, bear in mind that you really have to be conservative about this.

16:33.978 --> 16:39.027
If it could conceivably be a fuse to somebody at some time in the future, keep it.

16:39.628 --> 16:43.474
Which is, I think, for a big library, is the right way to go.

16:43.554 --> 16:45.818
I mean, err on the side of keeping.

16:46.220 --> 16:53.148
The prologue to my new book, which I've given in talks, I try it out, you know, and I'll tell you when it's very brief.

16:54.369 --> 17:09.527
I describe, and it does allow me to make a link between Gentle Madness and this new book, is when I was closing the proofs for Gentle Madness, the copy editor, we desperately had to get some bibliographical information on the 1911 book.

17:10.115 --> 17:17.344
catalog to Samuel Pepys' library, right, which I had been working off of Xerox from Cambridge University.

17:17.965 --> 17:20.047
And to make a long story, I couldn't find it at Harvard.

17:20.087 --> 17:24.252
They had the old catalog on the most, but they didn't have the 1911.

17:24.332 --> 17:25.614
BPL didn't have it.

17:26.815 --> 17:28.978
Unfortunately, I read it to Boston Athenaeum.

17:29.038 --> 17:30.340
I go there, I find it.

17:31.261 --> 17:38.890
As I'm checking out the books, of course, they weren't on scanners yet, or, you know, I find, this is 1995,

17:39.528 --> 17:48.604
that I'm the first person in 84 years to ever check out these books, you know, and they're in beautiful shape, and there they are, and I say something.

17:49.185 --> 17:50.387
I've even got the guy's name.

17:50.447 --> 17:53.693
I say, wow, boy, 84 years.

17:54.414 --> 17:58.241
Who do you think they bought these books for anyway in the first place?

17:58.581 --> 18:01.406
And he looks at me, and he says, we bought them for you, sir.

18:02.488 --> 18:03.510
It's so beautiful.

18:03.980 --> 18:04.821
I love it.

18:04.921 --> 18:06.603
I mean, doesn't that give you goose pimples?

18:06.623 --> 18:07.765
Yeah, that's so great.

18:07.785 --> 18:10.068
It was the voice coming down through the ages.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.191
You know, you're not just buying for yourself.

18:12.251 --> 18:14.133
That's the whole point of a goddamn library.

18:14.434 --> 18:14.874
Am I right?

18:15.275 --> 18:16.757
Yeah.

18:16.777 --> 18:18.900
It's an act of... Of faith.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.043
Future directed public service.

18:21.163 --> 18:23.886
Well, Victor Hugo said a library is an act of faith.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.088
Yeah.

18:25.288 --> 18:28.452
In the fact that the future... Yeah, exactly.

18:28.472 --> 18:29.974
So... That's a beautiful beginning.

18:30.155 --> 18:31.697
Well, that's the prologue.

18:31.717 --> 18:32.738
And then I also have...

18:33.140 --> 18:35.003
Otto Bettman in there, you know.

18:35.463 --> 18:39.870
You've heard of the Bettman Archive, who's alive and well and living in Florida.

18:39.890 --> 18:42.093
Bill Gates bought the Bettman Archive.

18:42.835 --> 18:49.765
But Otto is a former, also going to have a chapter, by the way, on the Jewish emigre booksellers who were forced out of

18:50.977 --> 19:18.553
Germany by Hitler you know and who actually changed the whole flow of books and I'm not just talking about collectors but you know they brought this European tradition and Roger started at Harvard says we owe so much to Hitler and he doesn't say that with irony I mean because of all these books that were then the flow of books and ideas and that came this way after the before the war during the war even during the war and after the war for 60 years

19:19.192 --> 19:25.783
So what I'm trying to do is find all the survivors, all the relatives of these emigre booksellers.

19:25.803 --> 19:27.165
But how the hell did I get off on that?

19:28.808 --> 19:30.611
I'm sorry, what was I talking about before that?

19:35.639 --> 19:37.622
You started off by talking about the beginning.

19:38.581 --> 19:41.545
Anyway, my mind is a war.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.226
I'm sorry.

19:42.607 --> 19:49.196
It's a very, very interesting concept, you know, about books, saving books, saving ideas, passing them.

19:49.216 --> 19:50.778
I don't know.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.861
Anyway, listen, want to take a break here?

19:53.102 --> 19:54.463
I think we've got a lot of stuff.

19:54.904 --> 19:56.967
Are you going to be around this fall, do you think?

19:58.329 --> 19:58.429
Yeah.

19:58.696 --> 19:59.877
Yeah, just call any time.

20:00.258 --> 20:09.528
You know, maybe when I come out, because one of the, I think I'm coming out in November, the, what is it, the Association of Literary Critics and Scholars, you've heard of them.

20:09.588 --> 20:14.893
That's kind of the group that's been established in opposition to the MLA.

20:15.454 --> 20:15.855
Oh, really?

20:15.875 --> 20:19.038
Is having their meeting out there in November.

20:19.559 --> 20:24.123
Well, November's the only month that I may be gone for some period.

20:24.284 --> 20:24.764
Okay, well.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.348
But I think, you know, with warnings.

20:28.717 --> 20:33.743
but we're going to visit my parents on the East Coast for a couple of weeks.

20:33.763 --> 20:34.403
Oh, sounds good.

20:35.144 --> 20:40.370
I'll give you a call, and when I know I'm coming out, I'd love to meet you, chat.

20:40.810 --> 20:46.797
I'd like to pick up this discussion again, you know, if you have time to pursue it.

20:46.817 --> 20:52.123
What I'd like to do is go through the tape and the materials, and then maybe we go.

20:52.143 --> 20:54.285
Sounds good, and I hope you can get a chance to

20:54.856 --> 20:58.240
to talk to Andrea and some of the other... Oh, I'll do that quickly.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.422
I'll do that very quickly.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.384
And I'm going to try and get in touch with Dallin.

21:01.865 --> 21:02.926
Yeah.

21:02.947 --> 21:05.450
He might just want to articulate his position, you know?

21:06.031 --> 21:07.172
Yeah.

21:07.252 --> 21:19.168
The thing that I think... Well, the only thing about Dallin that... What I don't understand about the reverence for Dallin is that he isn't a Bill Gates geek type at all.

21:19.568 --> 21:24.154
I mean, he isn't... I mean, this is just sort of my own private...

21:24.758 --> 21:28.482
But he really is an old-fashioned ex-Marine.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.503
Yeah, well, you say that.

21:29.523 --> 21:36.070
You make that clear in the essay, which is... I think that's why it's so bizarre that he would be embraced.

21:36.110 --> 21:37.792
But then again, that's often true.

21:37.812 --> 21:38.913
But he doesn't have a book back.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.755
He's not really a book person, is he?

21:41.395 --> 21:43.538
No, and you know... He's a mechanic more than anything else.

21:43.558 --> 21:53.348
He secretly said, somebody swore that I would never divulge the source of this, but this guy who's very, you know...

21:53.817 --> 21:57.562
talked to a whole lot of these people and stuff.

21:57.582 --> 22:05.651
Historical-minded guy said, Dallin at one point shook his head and said, look, you know, France, who was the former director, France was a book guy, but not a book guy.

22:05.672 --> 22:06.873
You know, he even understood it.

22:06.973 --> 22:10.437
It's just that he couldn't quite say that to San Francisco.

22:10.457 --> 22:12.780
But anyway.

22:13.121 --> 22:16.605
Anyway, what I was telling, I remember now what I was about to say.

22:16.705 --> 22:18.447
Otto Bettman also came.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.609
He came here in 1933.

22:20.129 --> 22:23.233
He was a librarian, a rare books librarian.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.329
and he's Jewish, and of course he got fired and he came here.

22:27.071 --> 22:31.986
And he came here with a couple of photographs, but here's a guy who touches everything.

22:32.026 --> 22:37.864
He touches every decade of the 20th century, who basically invented this whole concept of imagery in magazines,

22:38.283 --> 22:45.793
who wanted to be a publisher, who was a rare books librarian and whose archive was bought by Bill Gates for 20 million bucks.

22:45.813 --> 22:51.620
I mean, and who wrote a book and who was one of the great world authorities on Bach.

22:51.741 --> 22:55.486
And while I was visiting with him in Florida, he's playing a Bach piece on the organ.

22:56.587 --> 22:57.368
And I say, why?

22:57.568 --> 22:58.890
And I asked him, why Bach?

22:59.562 --> 23:00.804
And he said, good question.

23:00.824 --> 23:03.988
He said, Bach always returns to the place that he began.

23:04.028 --> 23:07.072
I mean, you talk about a continuum.

23:07.753 --> 23:11.638
Wherever he goes, he always comes back to the place he started.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.341
He said, that's what I like most about him.

23:14.382 --> 23:28.962
So that's kind of the prologue to the new book, concluding with the we bought it for you, sir, and then going off into the libraries of history and then going up to the libraries of the future and the textual problems and all that other.

23:29.515 --> 23:30.356
See if it works.

23:30.537 --> 23:31.218
Who knows, right?

23:31.278 --> 23:32.520
Well, it'll be, who knows?

23:32.600 --> 23:33.982
Maybe the Pulitzer Prize.

23:34.623 --> 23:38.529
I just wanted to sell as many copies as I did in the last one.

23:38.609 --> 23:40.291
That's all.

23:40.311 --> 23:41.573
One step at a time.

23:41.593 --> 23:43.436
Well, good luck with it.

23:43.596 --> 23:44.818
I really appreciate the time.

23:45.058 --> 23:45.659
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.006
And you're a Nick B., so we must have something in common here.

23:50.567 --> 23:51.127
Oh, strange.

23:52.029 --> 23:56.215
If I come across any of these other documents as I go through boxes, I'll

23:56.684 --> 23:58.929
send them on to you and you feel free to just ignore them.

23:59.009 --> 23:59.450
Excellent.

23:59.791 --> 24:04.241
And then, you know, when I do have, I don't mind going over quotes with people, by the way.

24:04.301 --> 24:05.765
I'm happy to do it.

24:05.905 --> 24:11.337
So if you want me to go over some of your quotes, you know, when we get to a manuscript, I'd be happy to do that.

24:11.999 --> 24:15.587
Well, it might be good because I'm so, you know, I have this problem of

24:16.192 --> 24:44.443
circling back and restating. Yeah well sometimes you know I do like to make, I do like to see verbs agree with nouns and stuff like that. Yeah always good. So I have no problems going over quotes with people. Okay but I don't like, the only thing I don't like doing is the is changing materially what i was trying to say because that seems. I never do that. Yeah but of course no I mean I mean that you wouldn't but that I would at least I'm cheating but I

24:44.778 --> 24:47.042
I'd like to do that, sure.

24:47.062 --> 24:52.751
No, in fact, if you wanted to, I really want to capture the sense of what you mean.

24:53.973 --> 24:54.734
I'm saying so.

24:55.715 --> 24:56.136
Yeah, right.

24:56.196 --> 24:56.717
I would love to.

24:56.817 --> 24:57.278
I'd love to.

24:57.839 --> 24:58.660
But that'll be a while.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.683
It might be several months on that.

25:00.763 --> 25:05.711
I'm just starting the writing now, so hope to deliver a manuscript in a year.

25:05.751 --> 25:06.192
We'll see.

25:07.474 --> 25:07.614
Good.

25:07.634 --> 25:08.376
I'll be in touch.

25:08.696 --> 25:08.796
Okay.

25:08.816 --> 25:09.217
Thanks so much.

25:09.237 --> 25:09.618
Thank you.

25:09.798 --> 25:10.579
Thank you very much.

25:11.060 --> 25:11.601
Take care.

25:11.621 --> 25:11.781
Bye-bye.
