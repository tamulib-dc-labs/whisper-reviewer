00:06.764 --> 00:08.207
Good morning, Barbara, I'll get me.

00:08.227 --> 00:09.551
Good morning, Mr. Brooker, please.

00:09.571 --> 00:10.433
Nick Bazbane is calling.

00:10.493 --> 00:11.756
Hold on just a moment.

00:11.856 --> 00:17.389
I'll transfer to the secretary.

00:17.409 --> 00:17.750
Thank you.

00:17.950 --> 00:18.832
Mr. Brooker's office.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.316
Hi, this is Nick Bazbane is calling for Mr. Brooker.

00:20.336 --> 00:20.977
I think he's expecting my phone.

00:20.997 --> 00:22.140
All right, hold on a moment.

00:30.997 --> 00:31.538
Hello.

00:31.558 --> 00:32.419
Good morning, sir.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.260
How are you doing?

00:33.300 --> 00:33.440
Hi.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.302
How are you?

00:34.322 --> 00:34.462
Good.

00:34.482 --> 00:34.922
I'm sorry.

00:34.942 --> 00:38.427
I thought we said 1130, and I just looked at you in letter, which I just received, which said 11.

00:38.447 --> 00:39.889
So I hope I'm not late.

00:40.430 --> 00:41.451
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:41.652 --> 00:42.032
OK.

00:42.052 --> 00:42.853
It doesn't matter either way.

00:42.873 --> 00:45.537
I just got the, thank you very much for sending that package.

00:45.557 --> 00:46.318
You're welcome.

00:46.418 --> 00:48.441
I didn't even have a chance to read it.

00:48.461 --> 00:49.082
It just came in.

00:49.242 --> 00:51.966
I'm sorry I couldn't find that speech.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.249
It was a long time ago, and it's around somewhere.

00:54.289 --> 00:56.933
That was given before the Kexton Club?

00:56.953 --> 00:57.213
Right.

00:57.554 --> 00:58.155
And that's in Chicago?

00:58.275 --> 00:58.956
Yeah.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.478
Well, maybe I can get it from there.

01:00.498 --> 01:00.598
Yeah.

01:01.203 --> 01:03.225
I'm not sure they ever got a copy.

01:03.305 --> 01:04.847
There weren't a lot of copies made.

01:05.267 --> 01:06.909
I'd love to get a copy of it.

01:07.029 --> 01:09.732
I was surprised I couldn't find it because I thought I knew where it was.

01:09.852 --> 01:21.664
In any case, we are very definitely going to talk about, as we agreed, your interest in this undergraduate prize, which you've established.

01:21.685 --> 01:29.693
Maybe you can tell me what prompted you to take this kind of a route to encourage... I'm taping this, if that's all right with you, by the way.

01:29.793 --> 01:30.394
Is that all right with you?

01:30.414 --> 01:30.754
Sure.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.977
You're going to let me read anything you say about me first, right?

01:35.057 --> 01:35.859
Yes, sir.

01:35.879 --> 01:37.140
Okay.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.623
Well, that's fine.

01:38.663 --> 01:39.804
No, no, that's fine.

01:39.985 --> 01:49.178
No, I think that's a professional way to do it, and that's just fine.

01:52.964 --> 01:59.914
Well, I'd rather see what you plan to write.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.884
Well, that's all right.

02:03.904 --> 02:05.246
Well, we can talk about that.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.428
Let's work.

02:07.129 --> 02:14.518
The point is... Do you want to see... Well, I want to be able, if there's any quote that I... I'd like to see the quotes in context is my problem.

02:14.538 --> 02:15.519
Okay, fine.

02:15.659 --> 02:19.404
And have the ability to, if they're not in context, to put them in context.

02:19.424 --> 02:21.687
I'll stipulate to that, sure.

02:21.707 --> 02:22.368
Okay, fine.

02:22.568 --> 02:24.270
I mean, that's my only point.

02:25.051 --> 02:29.197
I have to think I've been burned by the press sometimes.

02:29.217 --> 02:29.597
Well, I think I am.

02:29.999 --> 02:36.151
I think you're a more professional project that came out of daily newspapers.

02:36.171 --> 02:37.614
I want to get it right.

02:37.634 --> 02:44.608
I had a collector, I'm sure you know who he is, and he said, I couldn't sleep.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.973
What was the problem?

02:47.053 --> 02:50.961
He said, I gave you two quotes that now I wish I could have back.

02:51.481 --> 02:53.203
And I said, sir, let me tell you what.

02:53.223 --> 02:55.065
I said, let me guess what quotes they are.

02:55.165 --> 02:56.747
I said, we talked for two hours.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.729
I said, let me guess what they are.

02:58.749 --> 03:00.150
And I had the quotes exactly right.

03:00.170 --> 03:00.811
How'd you know that?

03:00.831 --> 03:03.674
I figured out the two best quotes that you gave me.

03:03.694 --> 03:05.215
And no problem.

03:05.235 --> 03:05.756
We talked a lot.

03:05.776 --> 03:07.318
He said, you're going to take them out just like that.

03:08.179 --> 03:08.859
I said, two quotes.

03:08.879 --> 03:09.780
You're not going to make my book.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.202
And they're not going to break my book.

03:11.222 --> 03:14.245
You know, the book has to be a little more substantial than that.

03:14.265 --> 03:16.167
So anyway, that's a lot of talk for him.

03:16.187 --> 03:17.648
Can I ask you to hold for just one second?

03:17.668 --> 03:19.831
I want to do just one thing that I've got to do first.

03:19.851 --> 03:20.952
Just take a minute.

03:20.972 --> 03:21.032
OK.

03:21.788 --> 03:24.572
mail, get off the mail for too long.

03:24.592 --> 03:29.939
Okay.

03:29.959 --> 03:35.187
I was down in New York yesterday, had a couple of very interesting interviews.

03:35.207 --> 03:35.808
This is going very, very good.

03:35.828 --> 03:36.629
I'm really thrilled with how it's going.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.353
Let's talk then about this undergraduate program that you started.

03:39.373 --> 03:50.428
Well, the, I felt that there was probably, you know, in any sort of institution that's

03:51.100 --> 03:59.650
high-quality research institution, you're bound to attract people with scholarly interests and interests in books.

03:59.950 --> 04:06.598
And the University of Chicago has a library association program.

04:06.878 --> 04:14.647
I don't think undergraduates take great advantage of that, although it's available to them, certainly.

04:14.887 --> 04:18.791
But there's a membership fee, and that's discouraging to some undergraduates.

04:18.811 --> 04:20.213
But the library has...

04:21.104 --> 04:27.090
very interesting exhibits where they show parts of their collections, even other people's collections.

04:27.110 --> 04:30.414
In fact, Louis Math from R.V.

04:30.494 --> 04:37.801
had a show there on Budapest a year or so ago, his collection.

04:37.821 --> 04:41.165
Yeah, a very interesting show.

04:41.225 --> 04:44.308
So I thought there'd be some interest there.

04:44.448 --> 04:50.875
And the objective of the prize was, one, to stimulate

04:52.289 --> 05:00.597
competitions that people would think about in future years in organizing the collection to compete with the prize.

05:02.639 --> 05:20.457
The terms of what the students have to submit requires them to submit the description of their collection in a fairly professional way so that it looks like there's serious intent to the collection and direction and

05:20.723 --> 05:27.112
and ability to describe and understand what's in the collection.

05:27.132 --> 05:36.285
And then the prize, I thought, was large enough to give them the opportunity to buy one or two important things for whatever they were collecting.

05:36.526 --> 05:41.813
And so far, in the first year, I think it's been successful.

05:42.574 --> 05:50.005
It's a winning prize of the young man who collected the Bocos and had quite a few of the first editions.

05:50.288 --> 05:56.216
Dust jackets and everything.

05:56.236 --> 05:57.097
Yeah, first Lolita.

05:57.117 --> 05:59.380
He had some with inscriptions in them.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.081
No letters.

06:00.101 --> 06:02.484
I mean, he was clearly very serious.

06:02.544 --> 06:04.227
Yeah.

06:06.209 --> 06:07.691
Well, you know, described copy.

06:07.711 --> 06:13.038
I don't know whether he signed them in department stores, bookstores or not.

06:13.058 --> 06:13.519
That's right.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.524
But it was quite an impressive collection.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.726
And then they put...

06:19.617 --> 06:26.364
The collection, the two winners on display, the university did a very good job publicizing it.

06:26.464 --> 06:34.612
And I didn't serve on the judging committee or anything, but I think there were some 20 entries in each group.

06:35.293 --> 06:35.954
The prize is open.

06:35.974 --> 06:41.119
There's $1,000 awarded to the senior prize and then $500 for a sophomore.

06:41.139 --> 06:48.747
And the thought being that, well, the sophomores would get a taste of it and they'd have two years to build up the collection further and resubmit something more advanced.

06:50.448 --> 07:05.242
So the purpose really was to provide a long-term seed capital, so to speak, for collections to come back, seed capital in a way, so that the collections would come back to the university.

07:05.262 --> 07:19.375
The prize also, you know, what I did was endow a fund, and only a portion of the income of the fund is awarded in prize money, and the balance is intended to buy books.

07:20.097 --> 07:31.812
in the field of collecting winners, and they would have... Those books had been part of their prize, but given to the university right then.

07:31.832 --> 07:41.765
So there was an advantage for the university to take an interest in the prize, too.

07:41.785 --> 07:44.389
So I'm very pleased with the way that's going so far.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.772
Tell me about this.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.075
I'm looking for kind of a deeper motive, though...

07:50.101 --> 08:05.900
Do you feel that book collecting traditionally is something that's an advocation for the more secure, shall we say, not just financially, but for somebody who's been around for, you know, 20 years into adulthood, shall we say?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.202
Yeah, I think it's important.

08:07.222 --> 08:08.163
You know what I'm saying?

08:08.283 --> 08:12.248
You don't really see very many teenage or undergraduates.

08:12.268 --> 08:14.631
No, I think it's something that begins probably at college.

08:14.651 --> 08:16.193
It may begin earlier for some people.

08:17.219 --> 08:25.446
It probably begins when they start taking literature courses and really make a decision of what's important in their life.

08:25.586 --> 08:35.715
I think anybody can collect books if they make a certain number of sacrifices.

08:36.015 --> 08:46.905
The sophomore who won had a fascinating collection of science fiction by a single author who wrote under, I don't know, four or five pseudonyms.

08:47.290 --> 08:50.433
and he had doggedly pursued rounding up these books.

08:50.453 --> 08:51.834
Now, those were not expensive books.

08:51.954 --> 08:53.335
They were pocketbooks and so forth.

08:53.355 --> 09:05.526
But the reason he won was because he was very selective and very determined to round up all the writings of this particular author.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.069
Well, he was applying taste as well.

09:08.289 --> 09:09.390
There was a focus.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.211
Right.

09:10.291 --> 09:14.194
And a dogged pursuit of book collecting.

09:14.234 --> 09:14.975
That's the point.

09:14.995 --> 09:16.336
He can play at any level.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.297
That's what I'm...

09:17.817 --> 09:30.785
I'm hoping that my book will appeal to the cross-section, which is why I'm going from William Scheide on down to some of these undergraduates, I hope.

09:30.805 --> 09:33.732
You can play this game with $20 in your pocket.

09:33.752 --> 09:36.678
That's what Howard Gottlieb said at Boston University Monday.

09:36.698 --> 09:37.480
He started that.

09:37.713 --> 09:41.178
You may have to give up a good lunch every now and again, something like that.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.601
Well, but lunch is a passing thing.

09:43.761 --> 09:46.084
A book is an artifact, isn't it?

09:46.104 --> 09:48.087
A book is a permanent memory.

09:48.247 --> 09:56.498
I guess it does take... You do have to make a leap, though, from the content to the artifact, don't you?

09:56.518 --> 10:02.966
You are collecting the book as more than just something that contains knowledge.

10:03.147 --> 10:04.569
It becomes an artifact.

10:04.829 --> 10:06.471
I think very few...

10:06.940 --> 10:08.442
people own books who don't read them.

10:08.682 --> 10:11.025
Now, there's a sale coming up at Sussex.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.646
I don't know if you've noticed it.

10:12.667 --> 10:12.927
It's Tuesday.

10:12.947 --> 10:16.911
Jeweled bindings, the Chevalier sale.

10:16.931 --> 10:17.612
It's in December, I think.

10:17.632 --> 10:17.732
Yeah.

10:18.433 --> 10:24.640
Now, I don't know whether that man read books or not, but, you know, it was a collection fell in 15 years.

10:24.660 --> 10:31.748
And there, I think it was just buying books as artifacts and not for content.

10:31.768 --> 10:33.370
I think most of these young collectors are

10:34.075 --> 11:03.897
are buying books to read them or because they have important texts which they may have read in other editions but they want the original text but I think there is a I've met any number of people who read the book you know the book is a conceptual thing but couldn't care one way or the other about collecting or pursuing first editions or rare association copies you know what I'm saying

11:04.113 --> 11:06.256
There is for them.

11:06.276 --> 11:09.881
It's the extent as opposed to the... Right.

11:09.901 --> 11:17.451
And I guess if there's a purpose here, it's for the undergraduates to instill some kind of rate of respect.

11:17.471 --> 11:18.012
I don't know.

11:18.032 --> 11:21.136
I'm trying to reach for that of a sense here.

11:21.157 --> 11:27.786
I think it's to sharpen a direction, maybe to sharpen a nascent direction.

11:28.146 --> 11:28.787
And...

11:29.746 --> 11:35.796
That's N-A-S-C-E-N-T for my title.

11:35.816 --> 11:35.956
Okay.

11:37.338 --> 11:46.793
So that maybe it's just that little extra bit of encouragement that would cause and become a bibliophile.

11:46.813 --> 11:56.108
Again, we're not going to talk about your collection, but I think we have to say at some point how you came.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.523
to establish this.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.144
Oh, sure.

12:01.164 --> 12:02.005
That's no secret.

12:02.186 --> 12:11.303
I had won a collecting prize at Yale 25 years before.

12:11.323 --> 12:15.371
So, well, actually, 1961, I guess.

12:15.391 --> 12:19.018
Was Howard Gottlieb there?

12:19.038 --> 12:19.358
You know Howard?

12:19.378 --> 12:19.699
Howard Gottlieb.

12:20.354 --> 12:22.157
division at Boston University.

12:22.237 --> 12:24.922
He came over there in 1963 from Yale.

12:24.942 --> 12:29.669
I guess he used to supervise, he said, that competition at Yale.

12:29.690 --> 12:31.773
He has started one at BU.

12:31.813 --> 12:36.000
His is open to graduate students, too, by the way.

12:36.020 --> 12:41.149
Well, I think, you know, this graduate student is sort of a squishy category because you're people of all ages.

12:41.269 --> 12:45.636
I wanted people to be more or less a level playing field there with the undergraduates.

12:46.257 --> 12:56.092
I mean, there are people who come back as graduates, too.

12:56.232 --> 12:56.473
Sure.

12:56.513 --> 12:58.776
As, you know, as middle-aged people.

12:58.796 --> 13:00.899
I think it's nice for undergraduates.

13:00.920 --> 13:05.607
And I like the way that you offer one for a real undergraduate, you know, and a senior.

13:05.627 --> 13:05.787
Yeah.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.989
So you actually make it fair for everyone.

13:07.009 --> 13:07.109
Sure.

13:07.129 --> 13:07.830
Everyone gets two shots at it.

13:07.850 --> 13:08.211
You get two shots.

13:08.231 --> 13:09.733
Yeah, I interviewed one guy.

13:10.152 --> 13:10.813
You know L.G.

13:10.833 --> 13:18.920
Brodsky down at St.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.041
Louis?

13:20.061 --> 13:21.122
No, I know the name.

13:21.142 --> 13:22.183
I know what he is.

13:22.203 --> 13:23.585
He's a very interesting character.

13:23.605 --> 13:26.748
He finished second in the Yale competition, and it brings him to this day.

13:26.768 --> 13:27.589
What was his year?

13:30.672 --> 13:32.293
He's around, he's in the early 60s.

13:32.313 --> 13:38.079
He's about 50, maybe late 50s.

13:38.099 --> 13:38.539
He's about 50, 51, 52.

13:39.042 --> 13:41.005
Well, it was very competitive.

13:41.025 --> 13:44.190
There were people who had really, and people would talk about it.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.474
I mean, that was the thing at Yale that was stimulating.

13:46.594 --> 13:51.862
The prize was something that students talked about.

13:53.324 --> 13:59.554
They actually planned, they knew it was coming up every year, or every other year, I guess, was the same sort of formula.

14:01.537 --> 14:04.962
And they would work on their collections.

14:04.983 --> 14:06.585
Tell me something about your undergraduate collection.

14:07.088 --> 14:08.630
That's exactly what I have now.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.973
It was 16th century books.

14:11.234 --> 14:11.654
You're kidding.

14:11.674 --> 14:13.837
Primarily printed at Venice.

14:13.857 --> 14:14.258
As an undergraduate?

14:14.278 --> 14:14.698
Sure.

14:14.718 --> 14:15.419
They weren't expensive.

14:15.439 --> 14:18.964
They had them in bookstores in town.

14:19.224 --> 14:21.748
I'd go to the Yale duplicate sales.

14:21.768 --> 14:24.651
They were literally $25, $30 books.

14:25.032 --> 14:25.232
Wow.

14:27.836 --> 14:30.199
Yeah.

14:30.219 --> 14:35.826
Again, it points out that just because a book is old and desirable doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have to mortgage your house.

14:36.047 --> 14:36.668
No, no.

14:36.688 --> 14:36.908
Not at all.

14:36.928 --> 14:37.028
Yeah.

14:37.700 --> 14:41.765
Winning that prize, what did that do for you?

14:41.785 --> 14:47.511
Well, I think it was, one, it gave me a little bit of money.

14:47.631 --> 14:48.752
Two, it was recognition.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.074
It was a thrill of winning that.

14:50.094 --> 14:50.995
It was a great pleasure.

14:51.435 --> 14:55.520
And it endeared me, certainly, to Yale.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.542
There's no question about that.

14:57.662 --> 15:00.065
It's a key phrase, by the way.

15:00.085 --> 15:00.446
Let's go back.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.387
It endeared me to Yale.

15:01.407 --> 15:07.133
I think that there is, and you hate to look for motives, and maybe that's the wrong word,

15:07.619 --> 15:16.673
But so many of these schools, Brown, Yale, BU, UCLA, now they have these competitions.

15:16.693 --> 15:26.547
And I think the idea is, number one, to cultivate the interest in book collecting, but also maybe cultivate a future benefit.

15:26.567 --> 15:27.188
Sure, of course.

15:27.288 --> 15:29.772
Is that part of the thing?

15:29.912 --> 15:37.103
That was certainly my motive with this thing in Chicago, that I felt it was something that Chicago ought to have, just as Yale and these other places do.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.365
See, things have changed.

15:39.385 --> 15:40.867
The taxes have changed now.

15:40.887 --> 15:47.354
The institutions are no longer the beneficiaries as they were 10 or 15 years ago.

15:47.374 --> 15:50.718
The private collector is back.

15:50.738 --> 15:55.283
The government no longer makes it beneficial.

15:55.323 --> 15:57.065
That's the wrong word.

15:58.427 --> 16:06.516
It really doesn't encourage the private collector to be as generous if you think that's true.

16:06.935 --> 16:20.449
Oh, I think, I don't know how this tax will come out at all, but, you know, if it is, as it's now described, it's probably not going to affect people's giving patterns to money.

16:20.549 --> 16:35.924
In terms of giving books, it may, in terms of giving money, because I think most people pay state and local taxes of 3% or more, so, you know, anything beyond that is a deduction.

16:35.944 --> 16:36.705
So...

16:37.057 --> 16:55.096
I think it made it more than a 3 percent limitation.

16:55.116 --> 16:55.817
You may have run into this at Yale.

16:55.837 --> 16:56.838
You've had them on giving books to an institution.

16:56.858 --> 17:00.923
Without, again, without discussing specifically your collection, and I don't know anything about it, but you could probably give me a statement about what books B.T.

17:00.943 --> 17:01.443
or B.M.A.T.

17:01.463 --> 17:02.825
Do you think you could do something like that?

17:02.845 --> 17:03.065
Well, sure.

17:03.085 --> 17:06.068
I majored in literature, you know, French literature.

17:06.318 --> 17:12.407
the Italian Renaissance was an important area of my studies and interest.

17:12.427 --> 17:14.931
And the books really were all part of that picture.

17:15.111 --> 17:17.294
I mean, they expanded.

17:17.374 --> 17:23.864
You know, I felt they took me back to the period that was of tremendous interest to me.

17:23.884 --> 17:32.477
And when you'd see a book of important texts, perhaps interesting ownership and early finding, you know, it was a...

17:33.976 --> 17:38.841
It was like a work of art of the Renaissance.

17:38.861 --> 17:39.422
They're still fairly good.

17:39.482 --> 17:40.683
They're very immediate.

17:40.703 --> 17:50.733
They take you back into a period that fascinated me.

17:53.136 --> 18:01.204
I've just finished writing my first chapter of my book, and I have one scene there where I'm trying to explain why people collect first editions of rare books.

18:01.224 --> 18:02.245
Of course, it's almost impossible to do that,

18:02.782 --> 18:23.590
But when you hold, and I said, well, you know, you hold these things.

18:23.610 --> 18:23.850
You commune.

18:23.870 --> 18:24.952
Maybe you touch the creative process.

18:24.972 --> 18:25.593
And then I described the scene.

18:25.613 --> 18:26.234
I'm trying this out on you now.

18:26.254 --> 18:28.697
I don't have the text in front of me, but I described the scene where I went to William Shady's Library.

18:28.717 --> 18:28.997
I'd say where.

18:29.017 --> 18:29.378
I'll come later.

18:29.398 --> 18:29.818
Prince of New Jersey.

18:29.838 --> 18:32.502
And at one point, he got up and withdrew this kind of clamshell box from a vault and put it down and opened it up and withdrew.

18:33.983 --> 18:41.051
There's one of the volumes of the Mons Bible printed by Johann Gutenberg.

18:41.071 --> 18:50.882
It said, here, hold it, feel where, type, bit paper for the first time.

18:50.902 --> 18:55.808
Anybody who doesn't love books, who doesn't get goose pimples, something like that.

18:55.828 --> 18:56.088
And it works.

18:56.108 --> 18:58.371
I've read it to a few people, and it works as a scene.

18:59.549 --> 19:02.072
Maybe this explains what these books do.

19:02.093 --> 19:10.464
I mean, it's more than just having words on paper or a vellum or whatever, but am I describing the... Oh, absolutely.

19:10.484 --> 19:14.329
The way of communicating with the past, very directly, I mean, very tangibly.

19:14.349 --> 19:16.853
Communicating or communing, even.

19:17.113 --> 19:17.354
Yeah, sure.

19:17.374 --> 19:27.868
Because you feel it as much as... It's a tangible... I hate to use the word relic because I think it's still something of scholarly usefulness in...

19:28.827 --> 19:38.341
You know, visually, intellectually, tangibly, you know, it's very immediate.

19:38.361 --> 19:38.862
It's an immediate thrill.

19:38.882 --> 19:41.927
Well, I think under the parameters that we've established, we've basically covered it, haven't we?

19:41.947 --> 19:46.935
Yeah, I'm sorry to be limiting, but I just, you know, I have the same concern that some of your other people did.

19:46.955 --> 19:47.075
Okay.

19:47.095 --> 19:48.337
Can I leave the door open?

19:48.357 --> 19:49.358
Sure.

19:50.179 --> 19:50.860
Let me suggest this.

19:52.203 --> 19:56.489
I mentioned I'm writing this piece for the New York Times.

19:56.509 --> 19:57.130
My deadline on that is January.

20:02.678 --> 20:16.295
the better because it's in my own publication.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.758
But let's wait until that thing is published.

20:18.778 --> 20:19.579
I'll make sure you get a copy of it.

20:19.599 --> 20:19.699
Good.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.740
And I think that you'll see kind of what I'm doing.

20:20.760 --> 20:20.880
Great.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.261
That's very kind.

20:21.281 --> 20:23.083
And maybe we can, I'd like to talk again in any case, even if we're, you know,

20:23.924 --> 20:25.846
I'm not in hiding.

20:26.126 --> 20:29.629
I'm just concerned about too much publicity.

20:31.611 --> 20:35.835
I would tell you, I'm pretty unspoken.

20:36.756 --> 20:42.180
I think that you're being most kind and generous and out front, and I respect everything that you've said.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.183
When I come on to people, I say, look, I want to tell you what I'm doing.

20:45.303 --> 20:48.566
If you have any reservations, which is why I called you last week.

20:48.586 --> 20:51.189
I didn't want to get you in the heat of the moment on the phone call.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.750
Why did you think about it for a week?

20:53.101 --> 20:54.943
You know, what's better for you?

20:54.963 --> 20:59.249
Maybe I lose out in the long run, but I want people to want to participate.

20:59.269 --> 21:02.713
No, I think you're working on a fascinating project, and I will read it.

21:02.733 --> 21:03.634
It'll work, by the way.

21:03.654 --> 21:03.734
Huh?

21:04.195 --> 21:04.976
It'll work.

21:04.996 --> 21:15.069
I went in an interview yesterday with Bob Abrams, Harry Abrams' son, and I heard that he was a collector.

21:15.089 --> 21:18.433
It doesn't work out that way, but it is an interesting interview in any case.

21:19.122 --> 21:22.827
But the first thing he said to me is, I only want to know is one thing before we talk.

21:22.887 --> 21:23.689
And I said, what's that?

21:23.889 --> 21:26.352
He said, I want to know how come we're not publishing this book.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.174
A what?

21:27.194 --> 21:29.857
I want to know how come we're not publishing this book.

21:30.098 --> 21:31.660
And I said, Mr. Ravens, you'll have your chance.

21:32.621 --> 21:35.425
There'll be another one.

21:35.485 --> 21:35.686
Good.

21:35.706 --> 21:35.866
Good.

21:35.886 --> 21:36.707
Okay, take care.

21:36.727 --> 21:37.909
Thank you very much, sir.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.231
And I hope we talk again.

21:39.251 --> 21:39.992
Okay, fine.

21:40.152 --> 21:40.793
Bye.
