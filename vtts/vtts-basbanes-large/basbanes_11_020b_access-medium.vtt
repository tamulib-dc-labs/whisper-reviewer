WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:08.193
Something, huh?

00:09.214 --> 00:11.998
How many meters of oak do you think you've purchased?

00:12.018 --> 00:13.219
You must have a figure for that.

00:13.239 --> 00:14.902
There's a figure for the amount of oak.

00:15.843 --> 00:17.705
I think it's done in cubies.

00:17.725 --> 00:19.147
Oh, that's it.

00:19.167 --> 00:22.972
I mean, it's actually also a figure.

00:23.113 --> 00:28.620
I mean, it's a very similar, but I thought you heard that it was a bit less difficult about how you completely

00:30.389 --> 00:34.515
In making the bricks, it was totally closed.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.158
It's a slate, that's right.

00:36.178 --> 00:44.750
That's why they've got green and you've got the gray.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.414
They actually used up all available at the time.

00:48.516 --> 00:52.542
They did that when they were building the state capital in Albany, New York.

00:52.642 --> 00:56.127
They wiped out a quarry.

00:56.984 --> 01:14.089
Back behind the scenes, the nice thing is that the wood and the whole materials that are carried through, we don't have... I mean, yes, there's a slight standard or anything, but on the whole, this is the building where the staff are met to appreciate the building as much as... This is the mechanical book handling system.

01:14.109 --> 01:15.130
Oh, OK.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.293
Very nice today.

01:17.313 --> 01:20.358
Connie, this is the mechanical book handling system.

01:20.378 --> 01:26.046
It goes from basement four, the very top of the building,

01:26.566 --> 01:30.550
I've still yet to get an exact figure on how long the book is.

01:30.570 --> 01:33.634
It's between six and eight miles long.

01:34.214 --> 01:34.415
Wow.

01:34.995 --> 01:46.889
And this area here is where books go onto the system, and the area just behind us there is where books come off the system, and it works via a series of barcodes.

01:46.909 --> 01:49.992
So a reader will order their book, which will generate tickets

01:50.663 --> 01:58.593
and in the basement area, saying who the book's going to, which area of the basement it is in, in two parts.

01:58.613 --> 02:13.472
Then part of the ticket goes onto the shelf, part of the ticket goes into the book, and then the books are placed into red boxes, and the destination where they're going to is read via a light pen, and everything goes onto the system.

02:13.853 --> 02:18.038
The boxes never turn upside down until it's via a series of cantilever lifts,

02:18.693 --> 02:30.527
and everything goes through basement two, which is like the sorting junction, so that this side of the building arrives here and the other side in the science area.

02:31.007 --> 02:37.235
So as Jane was saying, we're going with high usage stock and low usage stock.

02:37.255 --> 02:44.363
For the first time we'll have some idea of what is high usage and what is low usage by the information that we get from the ordering system.

02:44.782 --> 02:52.159
can you specifically explain that you can log into the computer to look up

02:52.426 --> 02:55.210
whatever catalog record you might be looking for.

02:55.230 --> 02:58.215
And you can place your order at that time online.

02:58.295 --> 02:59.497
That's wonderful.

02:59.517 --> 03:09.793
And that message then can be transmitted down to the basement where it becomes then a printed out ticket for manual collection and placing into the container.

03:09.953 --> 03:15.261
If rare books manuscripts and other material won't go through this system.

03:15.528 --> 03:23.410
Are you going to retain the same British Library classification system, or is it going to be a barcoded-based system over here?

03:23.430 --> 03:30.330
It's what we use for, yes, but we've had to change all of these shelf models, because the new locations we've built.

03:33.314 --> 03:57.811
When you say classifications, it's interesting because our collections for some time have been placed by sequence of arrival and five rather than by any kind of subject classification within the storage.

03:57.831 --> 04:02.258
The 19th century storage is of course still based on an old subject classification scheme which remains but was then added on to in a random sequence.

04:02.238 --> 04:12.112
If we request the book, it's going to be located by barcode, not by the classification system.

04:12.212 --> 04:16.999
It will have a shelf mark on it.

04:17.039 --> 04:25.911
But the barcodes are for the direction of where the books are going to go, where it's going to be delivered to and where it's going to pass it all.

04:25.931 --> 04:30.017
Where we use our shelf marks, where it's going to say where something was and what it was.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.315
will be independent of the... I see.

04:33.395 --> 04:34.797
That's what I was basically asking.

04:34.997 --> 04:40.704
I think what this also ensures is not only rapid retrieval, but also probably pretty rapid reshelving.

04:41.986 --> 04:42.427
It should do.

04:42.447 --> 04:42.707
It should do.

04:42.727 --> 04:50.017
You know, just how often do you ask for a book and find itself, and it's taken five days to get back on the shelf again, or longer?

04:50.177 --> 04:58.167
One might hope that it'll get back much more quickly in this.

04:58.188 --> 04:59.049
We've got to recognize people to intervene.

04:59.069 --> 04:59.329
That's right.

05:00.035 --> 05:07.927
So there are lifts through this door here, where the material will be brought straight from the basements.

05:07.947 --> 05:15.417
When we're in the exhibition gallery, that middle area, in the treasures gallery, is where the lift chart is.

05:15.437 --> 05:20.966
So this is really the key area where the books come from, down below or wherever.

05:21.326 --> 05:23.229
And they will all pass through here.

05:23.549 --> 05:26.093
And when the book arrives at the inquiry desk,

05:26.512 --> 05:54.527
member of staff can press a button and at the reader's desk it says please go to issue desk and the little light comes on your book's arrived that's great and what do we formally call this room again book delivery i'd imagine we can name it right now if you want i'm teasing

05:55.351 --> 06:05.165
You've already been generous with your time.

06:05.346 --> 06:13.037
You're so kind, I know you're very busy.

06:14.519 --> 06:18.625
I'm glad we were able to arrange for you to see

06:20.377 --> 06:23.522
A range of people, so you could get a few of the fun.

06:23.542 --> 06:24.984
Well, I plan to come back.

06:25.104 --> 06:27.948
This is the first exploratory trip, really.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.671
You know how these books run.

06:29.751 --> 06:39.125
You go and you get the ambiance, and then you go back and you listen to your tapes, and then you develop your... Well, then you have to... I mean, they never end, otherwise.

06:39.145 --> 06:41.569
I mean, you've got an end date, obviously, which is a good thing to do.

06:41.589 --> 06:42.129
Well, I know.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.513
My last book took eight years, and I can't do this one.

06:44.533 --> 06:45.835
If I do that, I can't.

06:45.855 --> 06:47.177
It took too long.

06:48.271 --> 06:51.796
It's really important for this book to be published in late 1999.

06:51.896 --> 06:55.141
We could write a story about this.

06:57.825 --> 07:16.894
Excuse me.

07:18.055 --> 07:45.531
the builders were very good they used to write on the on the levels where you were it's hard to imagine now isn't it how difficult it will only you had to wear wellingtons and hard hats and um thanks oh isn't that nice see that's isn't that now who thought of that yeah really

07:46.321 --> 07:50.166
a very nice little detail for that kind of thing.

07:50.226 --> 07:54.531
I think British craftsmanship is really being brought to bear throughout the structure.

07:54.551 --> 08:00.218
I know that's ridiculous, but I love to see this wooden cover.

08:00.618 --> 08:01.680
I mean, it didn't have to be.

08:01.700 --> 08:02.941
It could have been metallic.

08:02.961 --> 08:03.942
That's right.

08:03.963 --> 08:05.765
But it'd be really nice to see it.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.168
And it should get covered with dust.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.910
Some of the sacred dust of it.

08:13.154 --> 08:14.235
Wow.

08:14.705 --> 08:23.220
Don't feel that you have to stay with me.

08:23.360 --> 08:23.961
No, please.

08:24.101 --> 08:28.629
I can call.

08:29.030 --> 08:34.118
I can get in touch.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.342
One thing I might ask, do you have any...

08:36.760 --> 08:38.622
The folders of literature that you could send?

08:38.642 --> 08:40.084
Yeah, absolutely.

08:40.324 --> 08:47.433
Will you maybe ask Annette to send a... Yeah, sure.

08:47.453 --> 08:55.282
And I love a lot of material, so you don't have to... I mean, you don't have to... Something like that one, which had all the statistics... All the stuff.

08:55.302 --> 09:01.249
How many miles of... News releases, anything that you have that would help you.

09:01.803 --> 09:16.223
I know you have to go, why don't you?

09:16.243 --> 09:23.452
I think we should, actually, I think we've kept the hat.

09:23.472 --> 09:24.494
Do you think they're preparing for this?

09:24.614 --> 09:27.658
It's quite worth waiting for a second, you see.

09:28.010 --> 09:44.770
So I think it's possible that Sandy will be, and that's his wife and Jane, who is over.

09:45.965 --> 10:04.464
Who are all these people who are basically the architecture?

10:04.484 --> 10:06.086
Most of the people here are both the architecture.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.648
People who have been associated anyway with the construction of the project.

10:07.668 --> 10:09.369
So in order to deal with who from the library did you ask?

10:09.390 --> 10:11.772
We said only the people who have actually been involved in the development of the project.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.373
Otherwise it's the right way.

10:12.393 --> 10:13.554
And who are these two gentlemen over here?

10:13.574 --> 10:14.655
These up up there and up to the top over there.

10:15.985 --> 10:23.105
Somebody obviously... It looks like they're prominent.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.730
They're involved in the...

10:30.464 --> 10:57.028
So to sort of set the scene, this is basically an unveiling of the King's...

10:57.008 --> 11:09.156
They all seem to be anticipating something.

11:13.226 --> 11:13.607
They're all poised.

11:13.627 --> 11:14.449
I think we're in the best position here.

11:14.790 --> 11:14.950
Amazing.

11:16.077 --> 11:43.725
It's very nice for me to see how this space will work with lots of people, and I'm taking every opportunity to see people.

11:43.745 --> 11:44.266
See, they're coordinating.

11:44.286 --> 11:44.926
He's giving a signal over there.

11:44.946 --> 11:45.507
Where do you begin to do it?

11:45.527 --> 11:45.747
I love you.

11:50.367 --> 11:59.584
Thank you.

11:59.733 --> 12:17.138
I'm delighted to welcome you here today on the part of the Department of Natural Heritage, which has been a moment and as possible for at this stage in the building.

12:17.158 --> 12:20.543
The project is one of the things which is my goal, and I hope the past 18 months has been leading to the progress which has been very important.

12:20.827 --> 12:43.577
We can begin to see how we can do it.

12:44.924 --> 13:10.543
Even if you believe in the world where the world is more powerful than the world is more powerful than the world is more powerful than the world is more powerful than the world.

13:12.633 --> 13:29.646
Thank you.

13:29.626 --> 13:59.515
I would like to mention a few reasons why there was the A.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P

14:00.102 --> 14:10.879
I'd like to thank you very much for your satisfaction.

14:10.899 --> 14:17.549
I have this wonderful pleasure to be with you today as well.

14:17.569 --> 14:23.479
I'd like to thank you all for the part of this Delphine's name which I mentioned.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.722
Particularly to mention what's from the name of it.

14:27.170 --> 14:33.987
Jim Hayden, a short project manager.

14:34.428 --> 14:38.277
James Clayton, director of Casey Young, and David Clayton, project director.

14:41.294 --> 15:02.419
Particularly, particularly, I'd like to welcome Professor Sutherland, who's certainly a bit 30 years ago today, and myself and so, just to look at them before they've been here at 30 years.

15:02.439 --> 15:04.602
And I'd like to ask you, to join you, which is a happy birthday to the round of applause of those 60 people.

15:15.145 --> 15:27.045
I expect that many of you will see the faith entitled Six Phases of Approaching.

15:27.498 --> 15:33.146
Phase 1, enthusiasm.

15:33.626 --> 15:39.514
Phase 2, disillusionment.

15:40.596 --> 15:44.781
Phase 3, disillusionment.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.385
Phase 4, search for guilty.

15:47.405 --> 15:51.630
Phase 5, punishment of the innocent.

15:51.650 --> 15:52.932
Phase 6, praise the non-participants.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.577
I feel like I've known participants, or at least many of participants in the business,

15:57.569 --> 16:07.510
My brother David really should be here, and this contract is his responsibility.

16:07.530 --> 16:13.964
He has given an excuse to see if he is in Beijing in China and the love to the same place.

16:13.984 --> 16:16.590
He has also asked me to give you the very best wishes.

16:17.161 --> 16:35.344
Now when I speak today, I thought that once you're always into the church, and yesterday I heard a story about the library.

16:35.364 --> 16:40.530
The man who went into the library and said, have you ever known certain sizes?

16:40.550 --> 16:42.292
The librarian said, well, it's good, the shelf is over there on the shelf on the right.

16:42.312 --> 16:46.898
And if you wanted to save yourself, the books were over there on the shelf on the left.

16:48.076 --> 16:57.147
So he went there, and he came back after a bit.

16:57.168 --> 16:57.810
And he said, was your attention?

16:57.830 --> 16:59.094
I mean, my brother said, Mr. Charles, he'd never bring me back.

16:59.114 --> 16:59.335
No, no, no.

17:02.032 --> 17:19.472
Now, the previous slide is that all of the special characters in the media who love to sell a little differently for a disaster.

17:19.492 --> 17:27.641
And this is for a lecture this week, who suggested that the thing to do was to start a newspaper that took apart all the bad news in other newspaper magazines.

17:27.661 --> 17:30.604
He shows a slide in the headline for a child in life with a bad diagnosis.

17:30.972 --> 17:50.080
pointed out that they were unhealthy, thousands of goods, and indeed freezes with Diagnosis on the same day that they don't have nationals.

17:50.100 --> 17:55.668
We thought that they would be great to say that people don't breathe about something that can take someone else apart.

17:55.688 --> 18:00.355
However, it has really been very quiet on the media plans, on our part, the structure of the Diagnosis, which is a kind of backhanded promise.

18:02.258 --> 18:12.296
It's really very decisive to have the opportunity to build a building with such high quality and which may last a thousand years.

18:12.316 --> 18:21.193
And I do congratulate the architect and the design team on the job that they've done.

18:21.413 --> 18:25.701
It's very easy to criticise the architect's design system until you start to try and focus on it.

18:26.677 --> 18:46.017
building it and making the island the following story will all illustrate.

18:46.718 --> 18:52.024
On one of our jobs we had two people who came obviously went there and so the portman was delegated to interview these people and the person was there and he said to him, how many bricks could you lay in line?

18:52.044 --> 18:53.325
My father said, well, I'm not going to lay out the rest of that.

18:54.554 --> 18:59.646
But he said, observations are very important.

18:59.666 --> 19:03.055
He said, now look at me, can you see anything strange about me?

19:03.075 --> 19:06.964
So he looked, he looked, he looked, and he mentioned, he said, what is it?

19:06.984 --> 19:07.205
What is it?

19:07.225 --> 19:07.686
What is it?

19:08.392 --> 19:20.160
And the informant says, yes, we will.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.205
Thank you very much.

19:22.846 --> 19:24.189
Thank you.

19:24.209 --> 19:25.793
Thank you.

19:26.077 --> 19:44.309
And the third fellow came in and he said, well, how do we do that?

19:44.329 --> 19:45.351
He said, well, I know 2,000.

19:45.371 --> 19:46.513
It's not a place where they've got a couple of days left.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.274
Well, probably two and a half months.

19:47.294 --> 19:48.236
And he said, well, I'm a nation very important.

19:48.256 --> 19:49.057
And he said, it's very hard about me.

19:49.077 --> 19:49.418
And he said, yes.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.700
He said, you're wearing a contract jacket.

19:51.187 --> 20:16.303
I would like to congratulate all of the consultants who have done a great job and will have not paid their job to just deserve it in true force.

20:16.323 --> 20:16.924
As in me, we trust the people.

20:18.524 --> 20:29.537
But I would like to congratulate everyone who has been involved with this remarkable building.

20:29.557 --> 20:36.064
And finally, I would like to wish great success at the Climbing and all the new workers.

20:36.084 --> 20:41.190
May all the systems work they should do, may all the people do problems with their minds, and may we bring you big up and need another one.

20:41.812 --> 21:05.580
Mr. President, thank you very much.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.301
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

21:06.321 --> 21:09.945
I'm the chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief

21:13.823 --> 21:27.304
It's a great building.

21:29.167 --> 21:29.588
It's a great library.

21:31.897 --> 21:47.456
In months to come, there are more and more campaigns for this.

21:47.816 --> 21:50.659
Those who have not been responsible for this project will stand for this to take place.

21:50.679 --> 21:52.121
But your interest is that you have to be responsible for this project.

21:52.141 --> 21:54.744
We have to all be involved in any direction that makes it possible.

21:54.764 --> 21:55.245
You want to begin today.

21:55.265 --> 21:56.166
Thank you.

21:56.568 --> 22:08.162
We may acknowledge it, but we thought that was a nation to make our lives as well.

22:08.182 --> 22:11.792
We want to recall, then, the principle that when the memorandum of course has received us, the policy has remained.

22:16.379 --> 22:28.256
I need to know this, though, that is one of us in many ways, not just in the vision of the San Diego, but also in the experience.

22:28.276 --> 22:29.460
And San Diego, you don't need to be able to be alive.

22:36.612 --> 22:47.017
Today, I expect it to be possible new friends, possible old friends.

22:47.037 --> 22:49.002
People who have been involved in building a fire about six years ago, from the next time I came to

22:53.842 --> 23:08.637
Let us say, the importance of this bill is going on a level of today.

23:08.657 --> 23:10.299
Not complete, let's work out.

23:10.319 --> 23:10.800
What is the implication?

23:10.820 --> 23:15.304
As you all stand here today, all the teams are mixed up.

23:15.424 --> 23:16.245
I can't tell my team from the other team.

23:16.265 --> 23:19.589
And so we continue to offer all the teams that we need to find.

23:19.609 --> 23:21.671
As I hope so far, I thank you so much for all those guys.

23:21.691 --> 23:22.292
And I get it on two minutes.

23:22.312 --> 23:23.713
We don't know who's going to be around here, so this is not the job.

23:27.524 --> 23:47.991
So far, it's three years ago.

23:48.011 --> 23:48.672
And so far, it's three years ago.

24:00.734 --> 24:18.572
Thank you.

24:18.592 --> 24:18.793
Thank you.

24:18.813 --> 24:19.013
Thank you.

24:26.013 --> 24:51.733
Thank you.

24:59.527 --> 25:19.218
For a long time now, we've been sharing the truth to the people around this individual state.

25:19.238 --> 25:24.706
And I'm enjoying saying to you this time, I'm enjoying seeing something again today.

25:24.726 --> 25:25.888
Well, it went a long time before all the people lived

25:26.257 --> 25:49.506
I think, as Brown suggested just now, this is a moving age of water flows.

25:49.527 --> 25:51.068
It's a huge logistic exercise, beside which Marley and Marley are peanuts.

25:51.088 --> 25:53.091
And yesterday, the use of the reading boards will be able to read this, the first of them, November.

25:53.459 --> 26:19.977
I want the event today to be an internal family celebration, and therefore, frequently, personally, not just to me, but thank you very much for that kind thing, but to all the things, people who've been on site were to care for.

26:19.997 --> 26:20.378
All the information

26:20.527 --> 26:29.628
updating the first stage of the building.

26:29.648 --> 26:38.288
As we present that edition, there's a marking in the way of my friends and colleagues, which is standard and medical.

26:38.308 --> 26:39.210
I never speak on behalf of the whole society,

26:40.051 --> 27:06.514
My partners, partners of the United States, speaking of God in your kind, and its lack of everything, when I own my own thanks to the various individuals on site and the troops that they work with, who have sustained what I believe to be the highest standard

27:07.338 --> 27:21.712
across the region of the region of the region.

27:21.732 --> 27:35.185
Firstly, from the Columbine King, the site of the King, so forcibly being done by Dr. Charles, very closely, Brown and Older, who spent the time on the one year, who did Mr. Doris, and Trevor Fox, all the people that were made today.

27:35.806 --> 27:51.757
Secondly, the Amherst was a team of trolls, and a very different people in the capital of St.

27:51.777 --> 27:51.877
Mary.

27:51.897 --> 27:55.063
And thirdly, it was the National Heritage Project, and the hard-riding and stealing of all things in the country.

27:55.870 --> 28:16.506
This building has been designed for us to return for a thousand years of fact-changing stress.

28:16.526 --> 28:18.790
At least, the nearest thing to the construction of many of the people in our time, none of that,

28:20.744 --> 28:29.838
I must, yeah.

28:29.858 --> 28:39.833
And all of those who have brought that everything to give you skill and commitment, and some people have helped a lot of those who make this easy.

28:41.416 --> 28:58.676
That can have given very special value satisfaction.

28:58.696 --> 29:06.765
I hope you will tell our children to tell their great children, great grandchildren, to tell their great grandchildren, to tell their great grandchildren, that my great-great-granddad has said in his building.

29:07.808 --> 29:18.320
and get away from it.

29:18.340 --> 29:35.900
Finally, I would like to thank the Shilling Friends of Jesus, the ingenious and good human way in which they stage the celebration and the sacred God, which it is my own very special honour to launch by being the digital talking out of my bell.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.562
Therefore, I would like more ado, after the stage of this,

29:37.829 --> 30:05.164
That's wonderful.

30:05.184 --> 30:05.524
That's wonderful.

30:08.778 --> 30:35.264
It's wonderful.

30:35.284 --> 30:36.085
This is a real tree, I have to tell you.

30:37.094 --> 30:57.244
I would never ask the real look of it.

30:57.264 --> 30:57.364
Here.

31:07.216 --> 31:23.711
This is an unbelievable thing.

31:23.731 --> 31:23.851
It is.

31:23.871 --> 31:25.034
Well, it was just my time that you were here at this time.

31:25.054 --> 31:25.254
I'm lucky.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.098
This is going to make its way into this building that's built for last 1,000 years in here.

31:29.980 --> 31:53.676
What do we call this?

31:53.696 --> 31:53.916
A ceremony?

31:53.936 --> 31:54.637
Does it have a name or any of this?

31:54.657 --> 31:55.138
No, we haven't given it.

31:55.158 --> 31:55.479
It's a ceremony.

31:55.499 --> 31:55.799
I'm very happy.

31:55.819 --> 31:55.979
Why not?

31:55.999 --> 31:56.099
Good.

31:56.120 --> 31:56.220
Good.

31:56.240 --> 31:56.340
Good.

31:56.360 --> 31:56.460
Good.

32:33.025 --> 32:44.672
Oh, my God.

32:55.503 --> 33:02.530
This is such a treat.

33:02.590 --> 33:03.091
Thank you.

33:03.491 --> 33:10.118
Thank you so much.

33:10.338 --> 33:21.409
It was, you know, you talk about luck to be here on this day.

33:22.182 --> 33:30.792
for building that is meant to last the library a thousand years, and there it's unveiled to the architect on the 75th birthday.

33:30.932 --> 33:35.258
I mean, don't think I don't know how I'm starting this chapter.

33:35.278 --> 33:37.380
Tough act to follow, Mark.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.442
Right, well, this is the science reading room.

33:41.245 --> 33:48.173
Very, very different in nature to when we were in rare books, which is reflected in the use of the open access shelves.

33:48.673 --> 33:51.717
This is the reading room, as I said, which has got 18 kilometers

33:52.017 --> 33:53.718
shelving in here.

33:53.738 --> 33:54.939
It's over three levels.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.382
This level is the Patents Collection.

33:57.502 --> 33:58.723
The Patents Collection will be here.

33:59.243 --> 34:01.825
The next level up is the Science and Technology Collection.

34:02.546 --> 34:05.949
And the third level is the Business Information Service.

34:05.969 --> 34:10.933
For the first time in the Library's history we will be bringing together the Science Collections.

34:12.314 --> 34:17.459
The Science Collections grew out of the National Reference Library for Science and Invention.

34:17.539 --> 34:21.282
It's been called the Patent Office Library in its original form, etc.

34:21.515 --> 34:26.020
the Science Reference and Information Service.

34:28.924 --> 34:30.526
Currently we have two reading rooms.

34:31.086 --> 34:37.594
We have a physical sciences reading room and a life-earth medical sciences reading room.

34:37.854 --> 34:44.582
They have their own unique cataloguing system completely independent of what happens in the humanities collections.

34:44.602 --> 34:48.687
So if for example somebody is doing a project on food chemistry

34:49.375 --> 35:01.408
If that's food chemistry which is affected biologically, for example, brewing, they would have to go to the Life, Earth and Medical Sciences Reading Room.

35:01.428 --> 35:08.636
If it's food chemistry affected chemically, they have to go to the Hoban Reading Room, which is the Physical Sciences Reading Room.

35:09.497 --> 35:13.982
So that makes one of those areas where we have crossovers, particularly in food,

35:14.367 --> 35:22.498
in biochemistry, because you think biochemistry will be with the physical sciences in the chemistry area, but it's not because it's biological, in the biological standards.

35:22.518 --> 35:25.823
But we'll be bringing together the cataloguing sequence into a continuous run.

35:27.445 --> 35:29.087
Up there.

35:29.308 --> 35:34.475
They keep the current 10 years of English language journals on open access shelving.

35:34.495 --> 35:34.835
Down here.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.798
That will be up on the next level.

35:36.818 --> 35:39.121
This will be the patterns.

35:39.141 --> 35:42.045
And the current year, or the current box of foreign language journals.

35:42.245 --> 35:47.732
One of the things they've worked out is the facts that you pick up in the researches.

35:47.772 --> 35:51.817
They said on average a science reader stays approximately 55 minutes.

35:51.837 --> 36:04.332
They like to come into the library, go to a catalogue, check the title they want, go to the shelves in the last 10 years, retrieve it, go to a photocopy and leave.

36:05.453 --> 36:08.717
And as I said, that's reflected in the amount of open access shelving here.

36:09.578 --> 36:11.340
But again, the finishes are very high.

36:11.692 --> 36:16.138
You notice that the desk leather in here is green as opposed to blue.

36:16.178 --> 36:20.704
One of the folk walls is that a member of public, one of our readers, falls asleep.

36:21.205 --> 36:28.534
They don't know which reading room they're in by the colour of the leather that is facing them.

36:28.895 --> 36:37.446
We have some that are currently about between 32 and 35 million patents of specifications right the way throughout the world.

36:37.780 --> 36:44.027
We can now order online and things are provided now and printed off by CD-ROMs.

36:44.047 --> 36:46.831
We have a jukebox service, as it were.

36:47.511 --> 36:52.838
And people do come to us to get copies in from the States of US patents.

36:52.858 --> 36:59.265
They can get them quicker from the British Library than they can from the US.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.868
That's a very large revenue generating service.

37:02.329 --> 37:04.952
The business information service should be on the third level.

37:05.219 --> 37:11.906
We currently house the current, the largest collection of market research reports on open access in Western Europe.

37:11.926 --> 37:26.721
A very high usage collection through, because within London you have the London Business School, which is a private library, and the City Business Library, part of the corporation of London, and they're ours and not as long as the science collections are.

37:26.882 --> 37:32.087
And the City Business Library, London Business School, as I said, is a private library.

37:32.692 --> 37:43.049
But also with the use of new technology and CD-ROM facilities in the business area, they have market research reports and that material is now available on CD-ROM of course.

37:44.791 --> 37:58.193
Science collections generally also have their own online search services where a reader will come in and depending on the budget will want to know if they've got a project or an area they're looking into.

37:58.426 --> 38:00.749
the library will actually perform the search for them.

38:00.769 --> 38:02.931
We charge the next number of pounds per minute.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.055
While they're on, there's a basic charge for staff time.

38:06.095 --> 38:11.401
The next number of pounds per minute online, and they're now downloading or printing out and all that.

38:11.762 --> 38:13.824
That's quite a large area which we go into.

38:13.844 --> 38:25.598
We have an environmental information service, a chemical information service, a biological information service, and we have access to about three or four hundred different databases via that.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.865
Do you have a special area for maps, charts?

38:27.886 --> 38:36.656
Yes, there is the map library that will become part of the special collections area and the map library will be coming over here as well.

38:37.257 --> 38:42.603
The largest part of the library that won't be coming here is the newspaper collection, which are based out of Collingdale.

38:42.703 --> 38:45.346
It was never envisaged that that would be coming into this building.

38:45.767 --> 38:51.133
The loading on the floors there had to be specifically built because of the weight of newspapers that were stored.

38:51.474 --> 38:54.437
We do have a microfilming project for newspapers, etc.

38:54.923 --> 39:04.016
I explained to you what I thought earlier, all the wiring systems below us are on a raised surface of about 5-6 inches and throughout there are various junction boxes.

39:04.417 --> 39:07.100
All the air conditioning systems are above us.

39:07.121 --> 39:16.995
And so once the wiring is open, there will be no trailing wires because we'll be able to lay wires and trailing wires underneath there will be no wires.

39:17.636 --> 39:24.205
So in some ways the delays have benefited us with the growth of the new technology.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.570
Write that in, so to speak.

39:27.551 --> 39:32.156
We have availability, but not money to put an online catalogue onto every day.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.661
But that'll come in time.

39:37.142 --> 39:42.408
The open access stuff, so if I go and take out a journal, do I put it back or do I put it on a carrel?

39:42.648 --> 39:45.491
We prefer to let the staff put it back.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.956
Members of the public, the readers, do do that.

39:50.257 --> 39:58.150
But of preference, we prefer then we know that at least 99% of our staff will get it back in the right box.

39:58.170 --> 40:13.294
Because if there's a run of journals, and say for example we haven't bound the last three years because we haven't got to that part of the sequence, the box may say January to December 1995, but in there you'll find 1996 or 1997.

40:13.645 --> 40:17.089
I worked in the science reading room on the inquiry desk for six years.

40:17.129 --> 40:20.593
And naturally people believe what's written on the side of the box.

40:20.673 --> 40:23.476
And so often you'd go up the stairs and say, well, have you been told?

40:23.536 --> 40:24.117
Oh, yes, you have it.

40:24.137 --> 40:30.544
And you instinctual note will go through and say, well, oh, I'm sorry.

40:30.604 --> 40:35.229
But so in a sense, we will prefer to put the material back on the shelf.

40:35.249 --> 40:39.754
Of course, that doesn't mean to say that readers will come in, they can be very selfish sometimes.

40:40.105 --> 40:44.389
they'll want to use a particular book and we'll put it back where they know where it is and where nobody else can find it.

40:44.409 --> 40:45.310
That happens often.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.412
Which happens so often.

40:47.432 --> 40:48.453
So often.

40:48.473 --> 40:50.995
And also, as Jane was saying, the problems with mutilation.

40:51.956 --> 41:01.565
People will come in and will find an issue of a journal and will tear out an article, raise a blade out an article.

41:01.585 --> 41:05.248
Too lazy to go and spend the 10 cents or whatever else to make a discovery.

41:06.509 --> 41:09.572
I think that would be hard to get away with here.

41:09.738 --> 41:13.885
Unfortunately, where there's a will is a way, even for criminal activity.

41:13.925 --> 41:15.668
Here, you'll notice we came through security gates.

41:16.369 --> 41:20.656
That's because some of the material in the science area is actually security tagged.

41:21.958 --> 41:29.250
In the market research, some of the market research reports cost well over a thousand pounds.

41:29.551 --> 41:33.697
And some of the market research reports, et cetera, are sold to the library on commission.

41:34.098 --> 41:35.340
We don't allow any photocopy of it.

41:36.620 --> 41:42.027
And we have to very rigorously enforce that in that area.

41:42.047 --> 41:42.948
Number two, pencil.

41:43.689 --> 41:44.229
Exactly.

41:44.510 --> 41:52.320
You know, because what could happen is somebody could be from Mintel and come in as a reader and say, oh, can I photograph music?

41:52.340 --> 41:53.561
We say yes.

41:53.581 --> 41:55.864
We can take our collection away from it.

41:55.884 --> 41:57.907
Something that you paid a thousand pounds for.

41:58.007 --> 41:59.529
And they won't ever sell to us again.

42:00.049 --> 42:05.496
You know, we are a national library and we have a legal obligation to the users and to the publishers who

42:05.695 --> 42:10.622
sell us their material and donate their material to us.

42:10.642 --> 42:15.689
I love the craftsmanship, all the little touches that are so evident everywhere you go.

42:15.729 --> 42:17.331
What we'll do is we'll cross through.

42:18.472 --> 42:29.087
I thought we were coming out to the next level, but let us say, take advantage of the views that you're going to get as you walk through the bookstack.

42:29.405 --> 42:32.609
Once we get books on them, you'll never see these angles.

42:32.830 --> 42:33.751
That's right.

42:33.771 --> 42:34.752
That's exactly right.

42:35.032 --> 42:37.996
And once again, a once in a lifetime.

42:38.157 --> 42:41.962
This is a facility built for a thousand years and you're looking at empty shelves.

42:42.282 --> 42:44.745
And the views that you get through.

42:49.752 --> 42:51.154
You know, you're right.

42:51.454 --> 42:53.277
We'll always be able to come and see books.

42:53.958 --> 42:56.441
You'll never be able to come and see empty shelves.

42:57.803 --> 42:57.943
Yeah.

42:59.003 --> 43:05.410
One of my favourite features in the building, nothing to do with the book, it's actually this staircase.

43:05.830 --> 43:06.231
Wow.

43:10.275 --> 43:14.219
We've just got, we've literally just got to make the whole come back down.

43:14.619 --> 43:17.322
But this is one of the ways between all three readings.

43:18.063 --> 43:21.647
You get this wonderful view here of what's going on.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.589
Oh, look at that.

43:24.089 --> 43:27.913
And this staircase right the way through and you can see

43:28.231 --> 43:36.379
And this actually is opposite the main staircase in the station building and the hotel building, which is opposite of... What does the station building date to approximately?

43:36.439 --> 43:38.721
It's Victorian.

43:39.242 --> 43:43.866
So, middle of the last century, it's not just about 1850s, before then.

43:44.487 --> 43:50.252
And you've got the same... And here you can see how the bricks... They match.

43:51.573 --> 43:55.057
They really do, and look how well they... They just had a cleaning up.

43:55.397 --> 43:56.398
They were cleaned in about...

43:56.868 --> 44:04.938
The last couple of years, it was covered in scaffolding, etc., and they've just been sprayed.

44:04.978 --> 44:07.702
You can see what it probably looked like over there, down by those portals.

44:08.102 --> 44:10.005
Yes.

44:10.546 --> 44:13.930
It's amazing.

44:13.950 --> 44:17.655
There's still original features, original papers on the walls in there.

44:18.155 --> 44:23.382
It's a stunning building, but the problem is with conversion of the building,

44:23.446 --> 44:32.515
to make it fire worthy for evacuation procedures, putting you next to staircases and things like that, because of course it is a listed building.

44:33.956 --> 44:38.320
Everything is going to be very different.

44:38.340 --> 44:46.008
This area generally is an area, is a red light district, King's Cross, drugs.

44:46.508 --> 44:48.210
You'll change it around.

44:48.230 --> 44:52.474
But we're bringing, say, five, six hundred staff into this building.

44:53.534 --> 45:21.870
readers anything in a day up to a thousand to two thousand readers in um we can only by being here in for that change we only can be part of that and sandwich sandwich bars currently there are only two in this area which is reasonable we've looked on all this down we were looking at actually no no no and meals is quite good they've started to bring up in london and um they they do quite traditional

45:22.120 --> 45:25.503
Irish and English food, and they're quite good.

45:25.523 --> 45:32.250
But when you're at the back of the site and you only get an hour or you want a sandwich, you don't want to come all the way down here and walk.

45:32.270 --> 45:35.933
So with all that, and all the visitors are going to be coming into the building.

45:35.953 --> 45:41.919
I mean, people are going to want to visit the building out of sheer curiosity to see what's been going on behind the doors.

45:42.199 --> 45:44.341
It will behoove the city to clean up the area.

45:44.481 --> 45:46.403
Just the same way they did with Times Square in New York.

45:46.423 --> 45:49.326
There is a big project on the King's Cross regeneration project.

45:49.627 --> 45:54.253
because part of the channel tunnel link is going to be coming into the back here as well.

45:54.273 --> 45:58.279
So there's going to be big stories and go out there.

45:58.299 --> 46:03.546
We have Euston, the Pancras station here, Euston station just a bit further up.

46:03.586 --> 46:05.448
Just a bit further up, of course, is King's Cross.

46:05.488 --> 46:09.694
They're all within five, seven minute walk of each other mainline stations.

46:10.012 --> 46:19.747
There are tube stations at Euston and St Banking's Cross, which have access to the Piccadilly Metropolitan, Victoria.

46:19.767 --> 46:21.068
I think there's five tube lines.

46:21.549 --> 46:25.115
This area is very well served by public transport, and also all the buses.

46:25.135 --> 46:26.096
You can get to the West End.

46:26.136 --> 46:28.580
We can walk to the West End in about 20 minutes.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.681
Well, that's pretty good, yeah.

46:29.822 --> 46:36.171
I mean, to walk to Bloomsbury from here at first, and when I first came here, it was an endless walk down to the British Museum.

46:36.488 --> 46:37.709
It only takes 20 minutes.

46:37.769 --> 46:40.913
It's actually quite a pleasant walk and you develop your own little route.

46:41.433 --> 46:47.200
Sometimes I quite look forward to my little outing to go down to Gloom through a couple of times a week.

46:47.220 --> 46:52.505
So I think generally this area will start to come up.

46:52.666 --> 46:54.988
There's arches a bit further along here.

46:55.369 --> 46:59.813
You know, somebody gets somebody to open a wine bar or a restaurant or something.

46:59.833 --> 47:00.214
It'll happen.

47:00.274 --> 47:01.315
And I think it will happen.

47:02.476 --> 47:04.058
We'll come back in, say, 10 years.

47:04.639 --> 47:05.820
I think it'll be less than that.

47:06.138 --> 47:07.900
Maybe, yeah.

47:08.060 --> 47:09.201
When there's a will to do it.

47:09.301 --> 47:11.643
I mean, Times Square in New York is a perfect example.

47:11.663 --> 47:19.571
They're totally turning that around, because they want to turn it around, and they don't have anything real like it from scratch.

47:19.591 --> 47:23.395
I think in years to come, the library will not be judged on its building.

47:24.056 --> 47:30.362
It will be judged on how we've looked after the national collection of books and literature, very much so.

47:30.382 --> 47:34.626
And the controversy over the latest rule we've got, and because people will be able to come in,

47:35.062 --> 47:38.947
and use material preserved four or five times as long as it would have been in other cases.

47:40.088 --> 47:42.131
But first we have to make this wonderful structure.

47:42.231 --> 47:42.972
Yes.

47:43.072 --> 47:43.813
For that to happen.

47:43.973 --> 47:45.295
For that to happen.

47:45.315 --> 47:47.598
And it's not what the building looks like on the outside.

47:47.658 --> 47:49.541
It sounds very twee and corny.

47:50.261 --> 47:57.971
It's going to be the services that we're going to be able to provide to our users, to the readers, and to the public, which this building is going to be able to facilitate.

47:57.991 --> 48:02.898
It's for that to happen.

48:02.918 --> 48:04.039
I'm going to see out here.

48:04.424 --> 48:07.467
I don't know why you used all these with, like, cracks in.

48:07.487 --> 48:10.010
This is actually the strongest part of the stone.

48:11.031 --> 48:20.300
Over the years, where water has seeped through, it's created a natural fissure in the rock, which is actually the strongest part within the stone.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.902
So it has symbolic value for him, in other words.

48:24.044 --> 48:25.505
What kind of stone is this?

48:26.046 --> 48:33.553
This is Horton's stone.

48:34.343 --> 48:42.042
Yeah, over the hundreds of thousands of years, water seeping in through... And carrying minerals and sediments that make it stronger.

48:42.282 --> 48:45.450
Yeah, make that action the strongest part of the study.
