00:04.823 --> 00:10.089
Philosopher Bruno Paradis.

00:10.769 --> 00:11.690
Like Paradis.

00:11.891 --> 00:12.651
Paradis.

00:12.671 --> 00:13.372
Paradis.

00:13.392 --> 00:14.453
D-I-S, probably.

00:14.573 --> 00:14.834
D-I-S, yes.

00:14.854 --> 00:15.534
And the first name?

00:15.735 --> 00:16.836
Bruno.

00:17.216 --> 00:18.438
B-R-U-N-O.

00:21.221 --> 00:29.650
Another was a historian translator called Lefebvre.

00:29.670 --> 00:32.473
Yeah, I can do that one.

00:32.553 --> 00:34.695
And the first name, right?

00:36.025 --> 00:37.807
It's not Henri, it's novel.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.190
That's a question like this.

00:43.014 --> 00:43.515
That's good.

00:43.775 --> 00:55.110
Well, I will describe some... This is a text written by two colleagues, Girard Grinder and Adam Giffard.

00:55.571 --> 00:59.215
There are no more in the staff.

00:59.416 --> 01:03.501
One is when he starts...

01:03.650 --> 01:08.054
He left for an Alexandrian project.

01:09.235 --> 01:09.656
Yes.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.517
In Alexandrian?

01:11.958 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:14.220 --> 01:19.605
And he was in charge of the image project.

01:20.325 --> 01:22.748
Audiovisual and image project.

01:23.328 --> 01:24.169
Very clever man.

01:24.669 --> 01:30.855
And Alain Giffard was head of computer new technology project.

01:31.342 --> 01:40.384
This is the man who defines all the computer network inside the system, information system.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.913
We are trying to realize now.

01:44.614 --> 01:48.203
And you can have...

01:49.718 --> 02:07.727
on Internet, for instance, he is working on in the Institute, the Manuscrits de l'édition contemporaine, IMEK, IMEK, which is IMEK.

02:08.568 --> 02:36.567
I-M-E-C, Institut des Manuscrits de l'édition contemporaine, which is a little French institute, very interesting, because they work with publishers and authors to preserve contemporary collections from authors or from publishers.

02:36.918 --> 02:39.001
all manuscripts, for instance.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.223
And he's working with them now?

02:40.243 --> 03:06.098
Yes, he's working in IMEC, and he learned a lot, he learned me a lot about hypertext, new technologies, very... So they wrote, it was in 1992 or 1993, this work about the French Bibliothèque Nationale,

03:06.601 --> 03:09.205
And it's in English too?

03:09.225 --> 03:11.668
Yes, it was in the University of California.

03:11.688 --> 03:13.310
Oh, wonderful.

03:16.454 --> 03:18.497
Excellent.

03:18.537 --> 03:25.206
This is the official program of digitization.

03:26.308 --> 03:33.958
We wrote it with my director, Marcel Bodicaise.

03:34.664 --> 03:39.129
And we wrote this text, officially text, official text together.

03:46.978 --> 03:56.689
Well, we had an exhibition, sorry it's in French, we had an exhibition last year called Tous les savoirs du monde, about encyclopédie.

03:57.175 --> 04:25.933
the history of encyclopedism, and in the catalogue I wrote a text with a colleague from IRIT, Institute of Research in Computing Technology, and I wrote a text about knowledge organization and classification in the digital world.

04:27.466 --> 04:35.377
This is very important material.

04:35.597 --> 04:39.903
This abstract is in English.

04:39.923 --> 04:47.213
It was done from Oxford University.

04:47.395 --> 05:12.964
Well, it was the first presentation I had done in 1993, or it was published in 1995, about the links between, let's say, a philosophical approach on these digital projects, what it could mean, and I tried to do it with

05:13.366 --> 05:38.395
by regards of Michel Foucault's writing, because I think it's very near to this approach of document extent, l'ordre du discours.

05:42.104 --> 05:45.350
This is about reading environment.

05:47.293 --> 05:58.493
This is about...

05:58.979 --> 06:08.750
The Geoffrey Nunberg books, and I wrote a little article about what the text is in English.

06:09.211 --> 06:10.252
I didn't interview with him.

06:10.993 --> 06:11.754
I talked with him.

06:11.774 --> 06:12.835
Okay.

06:12.855 --> 06:20.444
And this is on the, let's say, technical point of view.

06:20.745 --> 06:23.648
It's from a colleague.

06:23.668 --> 06:27.973
In what format or what definition we have put them.

06:28.173 --> 06:39.511
how we organize the production, the control, quality, perhaps it could be interesting.

06:40.973 --> 06:47.804
This is from a review about what he's doing in France.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.328
It's from a colleague.

06:50.348 --> 06:55.496
Another text is in English.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.037
Sorry.

06:58.514 --> 07:27.525
This is about a virtual library, what we talked about before.

07:28.417 --> 07:35.748
Well, writing is a problem of relation with memory.

07:36.429 --> 07:39.474
Writing is a memory concern.

07:39.854 --> 07:53.395
And from Ars Memoria to the Nadu, a Ted Nelson project, we have some things who look slight.

07:56.480 --> 08:05.288
about reading Nouvelle Pratique de Lecture, and Jean-Nidier Wagner is working the next office.

08:05.308 --> 08:08.231
Well, this is a text in English.

08:08.251 --> 08:24.867
It's a review from Michel Melot, who was formerly at the head of the Conseil Supérieur de Bibliothèque in France, and we have done with him

08:25.336 --> 08:33.574
he had done with us a review of what is worth

08:33.908 --> 08:40.959
in France, what is done in France in digital field, in digital library field.

08:41.220 --> 08:51.496
So you will have some information about the Neuer project, PLAO, space de lecture.

08:51.516 --> 08:57.165
You will have in short review.

08:58.360 --> 09:06.991
Well, I've done another article in a library professional about web and bibliothèque numerique.

09:08.152 --> 09:26.916
It will present you this idea of, I told you very simply, of inside a computer, a workstation, you have to have access to different remote libraries,

09:27.318 --> 09:38.109
have your own personal connection, virtually, and your own possibility to... That's what we're talking about.

09:39.271 --> 09:55.688
This is a rather critical article from... Well, it was a student who was in stage there, who was from Canada, and... Well, she was rather...

09:56.343 --> 10:02.632
critical, but well, why not?

10:02.832 --> 10:04.374
You have already this one.

10:06.156 --> 10:25.523
This one is about one project about a French periodical who was born in 90, at the beginning of the century, La Revue de Synthèse, Henri Baire, and it was not called in the books

10:25.942 --> 10:31.568
in a book, and it was about this project of what we are doing.

10:31.969 --> 10:34.031
Oh, you have a summary in English.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.032
Oh, good.

10:35.132 --> 10:35.693
In German.

10:39.317 --> 10:52.371
Because we want to use this periodical in text version as a database so that we could help the reader to explore

10:52.823 --> 10:58.751
new information about science, about human science.

10:59.331 --> 11:17.515
And this one is about Walter Benjamin's approach, transposed in digital.

11:18.220 --> 11:44.565
well uh you will find uh several times the same thing sorry how does this word translate numeris you may say digitize it's digitized numeric for us it's digital digital digital library okay do you have an email address yes sorry

11:45.575 --> 11:48.259
Yes, Yannick Menin, BNF.

11:48.459 --> 11:48.739
Okay.

11:48.759 --> 11:49.160
Excellent.

11:49.180 --> 11:50.462
Do you mind if I email?

11:50.482 --> 11:51.823
No, of course.

11:51.884 --> 11:52.404
No, no.

11:52.424 --> 11:59.494
It's very, very kind if you can give me news of what you are doing.

11:59.514 --> 12:05.562
Yes, and I think I'd like to go over what I use so we can make sure it's accurate.

12:06.163 --> 12:13.573
You know, when I quote you, maybe I can send you some email or we can even talk on the telephone and

12:13.773 --> 12:15.254
There's no secret.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.678
No, but I want to make sure I have it right, is what I'm saying.

12:18.698 --> 12:19.879
Okay, that's very kind.

12:19.899 --> 12:21.961
Accuracy is very important to me.

12:21.981 --> 12:22.942
Yes, very kind to me.

12:22.962 --> 12:29.169
And I think that where there is a language difference, it makes sense that we get it right.

12:29.589 --> 12:31.231
It matters to me to get it right.

12:32.132 --> 12:34.814
That's what is free to me, yes.

12:35.875 --> 12:36.176
Who's?

12:36.796 --> 12:40.540
In Cornel and Mr. Lynch.

12:40.621 --> 12:45.069
Ann Kenney is the woman I worked with.

12:46.852 --> 12:50.177
She's in charge of the whole digital process.

12:50.237 --> 12:55.947
And then there's John Dean who works in preservation.

12:56.585 --> 12:58.007
There are a lot of digitization.

12:58.087 --> 13:01.391
But Anne Kenny, K-E-N-N-E-Y is the one.

13:01.652 --> 13:02.913
I'll send it to you by email.

13:02.933 --> 13:03.995
Yeah, okay, thank you very much.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.637
And her phone number, if you'd like.

13:05.937 --> 13:18.313
Well, I'm very interested by what they are doing because they are very specialized in some topics, in some issues.

13:19.254 --> 13:21.177
Do you know the magazine D-L-I-D?

13:21.197 --> 13:22.078
Yes, yes.

13:22.098 --> 13:25.242
She did an article October...

13:25.643 --> 13:28.707
This past October, October 96.

13:28.928 --> 13:29.609
Okay.

13:29.889 --> 13:33.174
It's a terrific article, and it's all about what they're doing at Cornell.

13:33.234 --> 13:39.443
You should look it up, October 97, D-L-I-B, and I'll send you the address to get to that.

13:39.463 --> 13:40.504
Okay, but I will come back to October.

13:40.524 --> 13:46.493
October, because she told me to look at it, and it's really, and she wrote it with another man, October of 97.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.315
Perfect.

13:48.335 --> 13:49.897
96, I'm sorry, October of 96.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.339
Yes, of course, 96.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.543
And I will come back to this.

13:53.563 --> 13:55.245
Yes, excellent.

13:55.411 --> 13:55.992
Excellent.

13:56.553 --> 13:58.375
Merci beaucoup.

13:58.576 --> 14:07.228
In American language, library has a very large extent, largest extent than for us.

14:07.889 --> 14:11.074
Everything is a kind of library, no?

14:11.795 --> 14:13.517
Here, a library is a bookstore.

14:13.798 --> 14:14.118
Yes.

14:14.799 --> 14:15.881
You know, that's different.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.104
At home, a library is this.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.187
A library is a university.

14:20.403 --> 14:21.905
A library is a little town.

14:22.266 --> 14:23.688
A library is in my home.

14:24.209 --> 14:25.090
We have a library.

14:25.110 --> 14:31.280
We have a very focused... Here it's biblioteque.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.286
Biblioteque equals library in our country.

14:35.847 --> 14:40.714
And it has a more traditional approach for us.

14:41.135 --> 14:41.355
Yes.

14:42.778 --> 14:43.038
Yes.

14:44.400 --> 14:44.801
Thank you.

14:45.382 --> 14:46.403
That's all right.

14:46.523 --> 14:46.984
You're welcome.
