00:01.516 --> 00:04.580
Is that a digital or a tape?

00:04.600 --> 00:06.763
No, it's tape.

00:06.783 --> 00:07.404
It's nice.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.006
They're getting into digitals now.

00:09.026 --> 00:09.987
They're very expensive.

00:10.028 --> 00:11.510
They cost like $1,000, $12,000.

00:13.052 --> 00:19.100
Maybe they've come down a little bit, but if you want to do radio work or something, then you've got to have the digital.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.864
But they're exceedingly expensive.

00:21.884 --> 00:22.625
They really are.

00:22.645 --> 00:26.930
I mean, just for the little notes, you know, you keep in your pocket.

00:26.950 --> 00:28.873
I'm going to check it out.

00:29.242 --> 00:31.587
You get a half hour, 40 minutes worth of notes.

00:31.607 --> 00:32.169
You're just fine.

00:32.289 --> 00:36.157
But I take it home and I put it on the earphones and the fidelity is fine.

00:36.418 --> 00:39.705
I have purchased... Is the wooden table going to bother?

00:39.745 --> 00:41.048
No, not at all.

00:41.068 --> 00:44.095
I have purchased, starting with a ewer,

00:45.256 --> 00:46.918
tape reel-to-reel.

00:46.938 --> 00:52.825
Every goddamn kind of tape machine you can buy, I don't think I've used 15 yards of the tape.

00:52.946 --> 00:56.130
I got stuff I bought in Japan 25 years ago.

00:56.170 --> 00:59.414
I can't work with tape.

00:59.554 --> 01:01.116
I just work with my own notes.

01:01.336 --> 01:08.445
That's the only thing I can really—I will have some of these interviews transcribed and go through them.

01:09.218 --> 01:13.025
I just don't feel comfortable with it.

01:13.405 --> 01:15.709
I can't get into the rhythm of an interview with it.

01:16.671 --> 01:23.482
Let's talk about redemption, if we might, sir.

01:23.502 --> 01:24.745
The predecessor to this.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.489
Do you consider this a sequel, by the way?

01:27.970 --> 01:29.553
Actually, it's a no-name.

01:30.154 --> 01:31.356
Okay, because I wouldn't call it a sequel.

01:31.376 --> 01:34.782
This is like that Miami defense, the no-name defense.

01:34.802 --> 01:34.922
Right.

01:35.155 --> 01:39.319
This is not a sequel, and it's not a prequel.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.845
It was a view from the other side of the mirror.

01:45.905 --> 01:50.110
Nice quote.

01:50.950 --> 02:03.002
What happened was I was supposed to go to Germany to write a book on conditions in Germany, and I said everything I was predicting...

02:03.775 --> 02:05.097
Contemporary conditions.

02:05.117 --> 02:08.482
Yeah, happened, including the wall coming down.

02:08.542 --> 02:22.002
And then I said, hey, man, I am not going to go there to chronicle the rebirth of Nazism.

02:22.883 --> 02:25.888
And, you know, I just couldn't deal with those skinheads.

02:25.908 --> 02:28.652
At my age, there's other things I'd rather do.

02:28.692 --> 02:28.872
Mm-hmm.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.814
So I had to come up with an idea real fast.

02:31.914 --> 02:35.920
So you walk into the publisher's room and, you know.

02:35.960 --> 02:36.741
When is this, though?

02:37.402 --> 02:40.908
We're talking, well, this is about four or five years ago.

02:41.088 --> 02:42.791
I would have thought this book's been worth.

02:42.811 --> 02:45.775
You were working on this for a long time.

02:47.418 --> 02:51.083
And I said, how about a sequel to Trinity?

02:51.123 --> 02:52.886
Of course, their little years went up.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.812
We're talking about a book that sold five million or so copies, right?

02:56.832 --> 02:57.373
So...

02:58.147 --> 03:10.125
What happened was I had to, you know, I didn't leave too many people alive at the end of Trinity.

03:10.325 --> 03:15.313
Me and Shakespeare had this one thing in common.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.616
We left a lot of dead people on the stage.

03:18.538 --> 03:27.411
So I had to bring those people back to life and go into parts of their life that were not covered in Trinity.

03:28.049 --> 03:36.639
In other words, Trinity was, the history came first, I would say, even though the hero was a staggering hero, this Conor Larkin.

03:37.500 --> 03:54.900
But in this, it's really, I think, one step deeper as a writer in which the relationships between the family is more important than the

03:55.758 --> 03:58.662
the history of the country.

03:59.803 --> 04:20.550
And the other thing that I found out was that the place to end Trinity was a hot topic, a hot-button topic, even to a point where I wrote a phony ending to satisfy the editor, and I was just kidding with him.

04:20.918 --> 04:25.904
in which Addie feels the kick of her unborn child as he goes off to the raid.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.068
You're doing a movie script for that.

04:30.469 --> 04:30.689
Yeah.

04:30.709 --> 04:45.846
So I wanted to revisit the meaning of the 1916 rising, which gained importance to me since Trinity, since I wrote Trinity.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.795
The event itself was bupkis.

04:49.815 --> 04:50.616
It was nothing.

04:50.756 --> 04:56.682
I mean, it was, in the context of the history of the century, the same as the Warsaw Ghetto.

04:57.883 --> 05:04.169
In World War II, the Warsaw Ghetto rising was nothing besides Stalingrad and Pearl Harbor and V.E.

05:04.189 --> 05:08.833
Day and the landing in Europe.

05:11.235 --> 05:15.259
But the meaning of the event

05:17.028 --> 05:41.736
You've got two of them in this century, is the 1916 Rising, which was the beginning of the end of colonialism, and the Warsaw Ghetto Rising, which both of them were suicide affairs chosen by the people who were trapped into the situation or believed in the situation.

05:41.969 --> 05:45.495
They didn't go out to beat the British Empire.

05:45.515 --> 05:50.644
They went out to, like yesterday, to get somebody's attention.

05:50.664 --> 05:51.706
To make a statement.

05:51.886 --> 05:52.888
To make a statement.

05:53.148 --> 06:01.964
And these were two statements for freedom, small people, that seems to be what this century has turned out to be.

06:02.765 --> 06:07.453
And they have long outlived their volumes.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.322
It's like the Boston Massacre.

06:10.362 --> 06:12.304
I think they only shot six people.

06:12.324 --> 06:14.206
Something like that.

06:14.587 --> 06:22.656
In actual terms, I mean, there wasn't that much blood spilled, but we're talking about the resonance and the meaning and how it has resonated.

06:23.336 --> 06:25.659
And this is what I wanted to revisit.

06:25.819 --> 06:35.550
And this was, if you can pick a point when the British Empire started to really unravel, was that they didn't know how to handle it.

06:36.003 --> 06:40.270
They're still growing just lately.

06:40.611 --> 06:44.797
The Scottish are beating the drums now, the Scots.

06:45.599 --> 06:49.545
Very fascinating, because they had to have the British markets to survive.

06:50.447 --> 06:55.695
Now they're part of this European community with 300 or 400 million people, and they don't need the British.

06:56.737 --> 06:58.480
And they got the oil, you know.

06:58.620 --> 06:58.720
Yeah.

06:58.902 --> 07:01.410
So, there is a revival.

07:01.450 --> 07:04.540
I was just reading the Times this morning, a revival of Spanish National.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.392
My wife told me that I— You know, the world is balkanized.

07:08.492 --> 07:10.920
The whole world is balkanized.

07:12.638 --> 07:13.599
Really?

07:13.619 --> 07:18.384
Yeah, but they've been doing this for centuries over.

07:18.404 --> 07:22.969
But there's only one good thing about the Soviet system is they kept these guys in check, at least.

07:22.989 --> 07:24.351
I'm teasing.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.055
Well, you know, there's more truth than fiction to that.

07:28.355 --> 07:29.637
There is a side to it.

07:29.657 --> 07:36.524
I mean, look what has happened to the Russian—will the real Russian people step forward?

07:36.584 --> 07:37.465
I mean, this is a—

07:37.883 --> 07:40.447
This is a pretty tough crowd.

07:41.408 --> 07:43.752
I mean, you're talking about the mafia.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.117
These guys don't take second fiddle to anybody, do they?

07:47.137 --> 07:51.804
I mean, if you're a business man going to Russia, you better go with some bodyguards.

07:51.824 --> 07:53.005
You better hire security.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.409
Take care of you while you're there.

07:55.429 --> 07:57.332
Yeah, you know, you don't live in a democracy.

07:57.372 --> 08:01.478
You don't declare a democracy and suddenly it's there.

08:01.745 --> 08:04.790
Look, Saddam Hussein got the popular vote, didn't he?

08:05.351 --> 08:09.437
That's a democratic thing.

08:09.457 --> 08:10.078
That's funny.

08:10.899 --> 08:16.648
Ireland seems to resonate with you, I mean, especially when everybody knows you for Exodus.

08:17.930 --> 08:21.255
Well, this was a...

08:21.522 --> 08:24.125
I guess you've made your statement with Exodus, perhaps.

08:24.325 --> 08:34.857
Well, you know, each one is a different statement, and because of Exodus, I have become a Jewish writer, which is fine with me.

08:34.917 --> 08:38.041
I'm Jewish, and I'm a writer, so this is okay.

08:38.421 --> 08:40.203
Good elements and bad, though.

08:40.223 --> 08:50.415
Yeah, well, you know, I haven't gotten as good as Philip Roth yet, but... You talk about bringing characters back to life.

08:51.323 --> 08:57.693
He's bawling a piece of leather in there.

08:58.153 --> 09:00.096
He's still doing it.

09:00.116 --> 09:01.418
Somebody had to do it?

09:01.438 --> 09:01.538
Yeah.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.942
Where is that?

09:04.202 --> 09:05.484
I had a research entry.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.107
Athro?

09:07.127 --> 09:13.517
Well, it was Athro, but it was done over the top of one that had been done 20 years ago in the old-fashioned way.

09:13.597 --> 09:20.487
And during the writing of this book here, you know, with this pushing out here, the whole thing went tilt.

09:20.635 --> 09:23.439
I had two knees, both knees.

09:23.459 --> 09:30.710
And what we're doing is pushing our backbone into our nerves.

09:30.750 --> 09:36.819
We're bending our column in here.

09:36.839 --> 09:43.930
And I knew I was in trouble when I started falling down.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.732
I suspected something might be wrong.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.655
It's a little wrong, too.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.143
Are we talking about Exodus?

09:52.047 --> 09:56.768
Yeah, well, that, of course, pins a label on me, but

09:57.170 --> 10:01.315
most of my books have not been on Jewish themes.

10:01.456 --> 10:03.258
You know, Battle Cry certainly wasn't.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.820
It was about the Marine Corps.

10:04.840 --> 10:14.312
I understand, but I remember going back 20 or so years when you came through for Scoot Jackson, a rabbi or somebody came up and said you said it for, I mean, you must run into this every day.

10:14.873 --> 10:15.714
It's fine.

10:15.834 --> 10:22.303
I mean, and I hear it from the Irish, too, in the most complimentary way.

10:22.343 --> 10:24.966
There were about 2,000

10:25.452 --> 10:33.244
kids, little boys by the name of Connor in this country now, named after Connor Larkin from Trinity.

10:33.264 --> 10:35.949
Well, your dedication is to Connor and Rachel.

10:36.149 --> 10:36.690
To my son.

10:36.710 --> 10:40.436
And you have characters in here, Connor and Rachel.

10:40.596 --> 10:46.065
Yeah, Connor and Rachel is my son and daughter with my young son and daughter.

10:46.085 --> 10:47.367
They're 9 and 11 now.

10:48.188 --> 10:49.570
You mindfully named characters.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.728
Or is it that just coincidental?

10:56.088 --> 10:59.272
Connor was deliberate, of course, from Connor and the Trinity.

10:59.952 --> 11:04.197
Rachel said, Daddy, you've got to put a character in the book for me.

11:05.558 --> 11:09.502
So I said, but there is a Rachel in Miller.

11:09.522 --> 11:11.745
He says, yeah, but that was before I was born.

11:11.825 --> 11:13.907
Oh, that's A-E-L here, too.

11:13.927 --> 11:14.167
Yeah.

11:14.187 --> 11:16.089
No, but see, that's our joke.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.633
Because she liked to spell it R-A-C-H-E-L.

11:19.653 --> 11:19.793
Uh-huh.

11:20.093 --> 11:24.098
So I said, well, I'm going to put a Rachel in this book, but how should I spell it, dear?

11:24.719 --> 11:26.701
She says, oh, well, spell it your way.

11:26.881 --> 11:29.965
I picked up on that.

11:29.985 --> 11:33.709
Well, that was an inside joke.

11:34.370 --> 11:38.395
I read things like dedication.

11:39.456 --> 11:40.397
I see that.

11:40.497 --> 11:42.219
Let's pick up the thread again now.

11:42.700 --> 11:46.945
You know, when you go back to Trinity and we talk about the title, of course, the title of the book,

11:53.185 --> 11:57.150
if maybe this is what you were working by.

11:57.230 --> 12:01.776
There are areas you can do here, I think.

12:02.057 --> 12:03.799
I think I'm Irished out.

12:06.923 --> 12:09.166
You know, there's a college movie coming.

12:09.186 --> 12:19.800
That would be the next step in the Civil War and the Black and Tan Era, which is...

12:20.168 --> 12:22.271
It's all very, very, very good.

12:22.311 --> 12:27.337
But someone has written a novel about this in recent times, a very good novel, too.

12:27.838 --> 12:28.379
Plannery.

12:28.639 --> 12:29.240
Oh, yeah.

12:29.340 --> 12:29.921
Very good.

12:29.941 --> 12:32.324
I think he won a Pulitzer or something.

12:32.344 --> 12:32.444
Yeah.

12:33.045 --> 12:38.131
And I think... That's it.

12:38.151 --> 12:39.833
I kind of think that's it.

12:40.114 --> 12:42.176
How old are you now?

12:42.196 --> 12:42.857
71.

12:42.877 --> 12:44.860
You haven't lost your fastball at all.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.682
Well, it's...

12:47.118 --> 12:53.829
The vital parts are still working.

12:53.849 --> 12:59.339
I seem to be able to get it together.

12:59.519 --> 13:10.037
I must say that I feel that I'm putting the language together in a better way.

13:10.675 --> 13:13.678
I still can tell a story which matters.

13:13.698 --> 13:17.601
And I think my character relationships are better.

13:18.322 --> 13:23.346
And, of course, all the women love this one, because I've got three, quote, liberated women.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.368
Well, she was, if I may say so.

13:25.388 --> 13:29.231
I won't say that in French, but I say that at my peril.

13:32.174 --> 13:40.041
These were more or less a—my women, I've always had trouble with my women characters.

13:40.544 --> 13:44.592
You mean in terms of development or in terms of their reception by other women?

13:44.612 --> 13:49.762
In terms of their reception, and probably rightfully so.

13:50.504 --> 13:55.293
So I decided to really put the whole shooting match in here.

13:55.313 --> 13:56.275
That's something.

13:56.947 --> 14:26.127
about the decision to use Winston so I won't give away the ending in any way but he sure becomes it was there you know I mean in constructing this book the first half of this book was constructive there's nothing ever been constructed like this I used about 25 or 30 chapters out of Trinity put them in verbatim

14:26.427 --> 14:30.030
Then I went over them all and wrote them from a different point of view.

14:30.050 --> 14:33.974
And they fit together pretty well.

14:34.634 --> 14:49.808
But part of the thing that I had working for me, number one, we knew that Jeremy and Christopher had been killed at Gallipoli.

14:49.828 --> 14:50.769
And you can't change?

14:51.430 --> 14:55.033
All right, number two is we know that Liam went to

14:55.435 --> 14:56.576
to New Zealand.

14:57.798 --> 15:06.208
And number three, the Anzac Corps was the defining battle for the Australians and New Zealand of their history.

15:06.268 --> 15:07.590
That made them a nation.

15:09.232 --> 15:13.136
The Battle of Gallipoli was, of course, a tremendous tragedy.

15:13.757 --> 15:16.020
So I had these three guys sitting here.

15:16.040 --> 15:22.928
I had Caroline, who had access to everybody in the British Isles, and I had

15:23.178 --> 15:25.642
the architect of Gallipoli.

15:26.523 --> 15:27.725
So I said, what the hell?

15:27.805 --> 15:30.109
I mean, why not use Winston Churchill?

15:30.169 --> 15:35.818
And I used an awful lot of his own words.

15:36.599 --> 15:39.223
This journal is supposed to be sealed until 2050.

15:39.383 --> 15:42.728
Well, you'll never know.

15:45.513 --> 15:48.257
Well, I mean, part of the research is that.

15:48.592 --> 15:50.574
It's very accurate.

15:50.854 --> 15:53.677
I don't know about... It's based on your knowledge.

15:53.838 --> 15:55.059
It's very accurate.

15:55.399 --> 16:14.840
A lot of the stuff is... He wrote a five-volume book called... It was World War I, the history of World War I. And Gallipoli, of course, from his viewpoint, he was an innocent bystander.

16:14.860 --> 16:18.244
But it was the whole thing...

16:18.798 --> 16:21.983
was a balls.

16:22.243 --> 16:27.511
From concept through execution, it never had a goddamn chance.

16:29.233 --> 16:47.320
And they based it, I think, partly on the fact that the Turks had just gotten whipped, had been whipped for the last 50 years, had been whipped by the Balkan countries, they'd been thrown out of North Africa, they had shrunk their empire all over

16:47.789 --> 16:52.094
And it was totally corrupt, ready to collapse.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.076
And then they made one.

16:54.397 --> 17:05.470
Then the new Turks, the young Turks, that's where the expression came in, happened to a fellow by the name of, believe it or not, Ataturk.

17:05.490 --> 17:17.003
Kamil Ataturk was a young officer in Gallipoli and later became sort of the father of modern Turkey.

17:17.877 --> 17:30.883
But why they put those men in that location, they never advanced beyond the first day.

17:32.386 --> 17:36.595
And, of course, they expected way too much of naval gunfire.

17:37.638 --> 17:41.522
which shoots its flat trajectory, as you know.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.063
That's very accurate, though.

17:43.964 --> 17:46.266
Yeah, but it doesn't go into the ground.

17:46.947 --> 17:51.991
We had the same situation on Tarawa.

17:52.932 --> 17:56.516
We had battle wagons standing there point blank hitting that.

17:56.596 --> 18:04.523
That's why when they brought the Missouri back and they brought the battleships back in the 60s and 70s, they said, these shells really aren't

18:05.195 --> 18:09.464
appropriate for the function that we're putting them together for, you know.

18:09.685 --> 18:13.553
So they had to come up with these new kinds of penetration shells and stuff like that.

18:13.573 --> 18:22.453
Yeah, so it's, men defending a position can take an awful lot, take a hell of a meeting.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.537
Chris, that's the British nature, though.

18:25.394 --> 18:31.140
Well, there's another element in that they hadn't fought a modern war.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.083
I mean, there is glory in battle in the British mindset.

18:34.103 --> 18:38.768
Oh, march across that open field, you know, with your red coat on.

18:39.709 --> 18:44.153
But they had not fought a modern war since Napoleon.

18:45.375 --> 18:54.304
So it was a lot of 18th century or 19th century generals fighting a 20th century war.

18:54.436 --> 19:09.755
Trying to, and the other big factor, of course, was the invention of the machine gun, which was the killer of the World War War.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.599
Well, I must say, those scenes there are terrific.

19:12.639 --> 19:13.600
How do you redo that?

19:13.740 --> 19:15.963
I didn't.

19:17.064 --> 19:17.965
This was all new.

19:18.306 --> 19:24.173
Just the first half of the book, when I'm trying to get the book rolling together, is where I use parts of Trinity.

19:24.271 --> 19:26.734
But I had to recreate Dilipoli.

19:26.814 --> 19:29.617
But I mean, you did research and— Oh, sure.

19:29.757 --> 19:32.099
I had a guy— You could visualize this thing, I guess.

19:32.179 --> 19:32.600
No, no, no.

19:32.620 --> 19:33.741
I had a guy in New Zealand.

19:35.443 --> 19:42.130
Believe it or not, the brother of my researcher lived in New Zealand and was somewhat of a historian.

19:43.191 --> 19:51.780
And he picked up things like the book written on the front lines, and it was published the year

19:52.115 --> 19:56.181
I mean, it was by privates and sergeants and lieutenants.

19:57.202 --> 20:01.308
And it had the commander's reports in there, the general's reports.

20:01.328 --> 20:07.156
And the general's reports on a battle and what happened that day were just two entirely different things.

20:08.397 --> 20:15.107
It was like all the lawyers watching the jurors come in from the OJ trial, and they said, oh.

20:15.888 --> 20:16.989
They got their face down.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.011
They're not looking at them.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.473
The other guy gave them a power.

20:20.334 --> 20:21.936
Every one of them had a different reading.

20:22.810 --> 20:26.694
And you can watch the same, exact same battle.

20:26.754 --> 20:30.818
Two men can watch the exact same battle and get a different version.

20:31.119 --> 20:33.641
Look at two cars hitting each other in the street.

20:33.881 --> 20:36.324
There's always going to be two stories there.

20:36.985 --> 20:47.215
So they had a way of sending in a report that made it seem like this was our situation, and we did this and this and this, and that was the best we could do.

20:47.887 --> 20:54.038
Our casualties were a little heavy, but it was worth it because we showed them that we weren't scared of them or something like that.

20:55.060 --> 21:02.214
So it was what it gave me a chance to do.

21:02.254 --> 21:06.281
When I wrote Battle Cry, I was restricted by my era.

21:07.543 --> 21:09.066
You couldn't put a fuck in.

21:09.086 --> 21:11.110
You couldn't...

21:11.984 --> 21:23.180
We were very, very restricted in how far we could go.

21:23.220 --> 21:33.575
And I didn't have the depth as a writer to understand the relationships.

21:34.236 --> 21:39.223
The relationships were—they were all neat guys, but they were fairly surface.

21:40.030 --> 21:50.006
In this, we really get into, I think, the Cairo scenes and the love of these guys for each other, particularly coming from all parts of the world.

21:51.028 --> 22:00.844
And it was my reprise, so to speak, for Battle Cry, and I was very happy with the way to turn this up.

22:00.864 --> 22:03.789
It's something you just can't express unless you experience it.

22:03.809 --> 22:05.852
Well, you know, there's certain things that hit you, like,

22:06.541 --> 22:12.047
arms and legs floating across the Mediterranean, washing up on the beaches.

22:13.329 --> 22:34.453
And when they had to bury these guys and bayonet them to get the gas out of them, and then their guts exploded all over the place, it was... If anything ever showed the total godlessness and uselessness of war, the Turks at least were fighting on their own home territory, on their own home ground.

22:35.454 --> 22:36.075
So they...

22:36.967 --> 22:40.471
There was passion attached.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.133
They had a reason for being there.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.935
It's like the Russians in World War II.

22:45.015 --> 22:45.696
Absolutely.

22:45.796 --> 22:55.045
I'll never forget I got into a real heated discussion on my first trip to Russia when it was not nice to go, a long, long time ago.

22:56.046 --> 22:59.550
And she says, but our boys fought so hard.

23:00.431 --> 23:06.417
I said, I fought hard too, but I fought 3,000 miles away from home, 4,000 miles away from home.

23:06.835 --> 23:13.383
So this doesn't take a hell of a lot of courage to defend your own village, you know, when your wife's going to get ready.

23:13.963 --> 23:19.590
But when you're asked to march into gunfire, and she never thought of it that way.

23:20.811 --> 23:22.854
We keep our asses down, Tony.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.017
So the light of fire.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.139
Yeah.

23:27.579 --> 23:32.505
So the Turks had a reason for fighting, but...

23:33.008 --> 23:50.830
Not only did the British have no reason for fighting—well, they had a political reason, but these poor Aussies and New Zealanders, these were just a bunch of farm boys looking for a good time in Paris, you know?

23:50.850 --> 23:50.950
Yeah.

23:51.183 --> 23:55.169
To develop the New Zealand angle, I thought it was terrific.

23:55.890 --> 24:01.398
Contrasting Inwald Isles is really connected to the British Empire, too.

24:01.659 --> 24:03.762
That turned out that way.

24:05.985 --> 24:09.310
New Zealand is a very mystical, special place.

24:10.015 --> 24:14.540
We're seeing a tremendous amount of talent come out of that country now.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.842
For such a small country, population-wise.

24:16.862 --> 24:20.245
Three, four million, and same size as Ireland.

24:20.346 --> 24:21.507
Maybe it's a little smaller.

24:22.167 --> 24:28.094
But in their motion picture, this Jane Campion is like a Shakespeare.

24:28.814 --> 24:29.995
The one that did the piano?

24:30.316 --> 24:31.537
Yeah, I know.

24:31.817 --> 24:32.658
Oh, that woman.

24:32.678 --> 24:34.420
Have you seen her?

24:34.467 --> 24:35.689
Yeah, I think so.

24:35.729 --> 24:36.249
See it again.

24:36.310 --> 24:37.431
See it again.

24:37.731 --> 24:41.757
My kids watch it every once in a while, and I'm walking by, and I... Jesus.

24:41.957 --> 24:43.019
No, no.

24:43.139 --> 24:46.784
With her, you've got to sit and say, this is all I do this evening.

24:47.865 --> 24:58.620
And I tried to see Angel at the table about four times, and then I said, look, if she wrote it, she's got to say something.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.462
Tonight, I'm locking in.

25:00.723 --> 25:00.863
Mm-hmm.

25:01.147 --> 25:02.949
And it was one of these three-hour pictures.

25:03.310 --> 25:07.796
And it looked like, the first part of it looked like it was shot by an NYU film class.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.200
And then suddenly I'm nailed to the seat.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.263
She's gotten it across.

25:13.523 --> 25:14.585
She's come in to me.

25:15.165 --> 25:18.089
This woman... Do you look at this for craft, by the way?

25:18.129 --> 25:20.252
Or are you looking at it as... Oh, she's genius.

25:20.552 --> 25:27.361
But I mean, being a writer of some note and familiar with... Well, she's in film.

25:27.421 --> 25:28.543
She's dealing in film.

25:28.563 --> 25:31.086
Yeah, but she's still in storytelling, isn't it?

25:31.167 --> 25:36.111
Yeah, but she goes one step beyond Jesus.

25:37.393 --> 25:39.975
You are inside the body of a deaf woman.

25:41.476 --> 25:43.598
You are inside the body of a deaf woman.

25:44.519 --> 25:46.521
She puts you in there.

25:47.121 --> 25:48.122
It's a genius.

25:49.063 --> 25:50.024
Well, it's genius.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.867
I call it Shakespearean.

25:55.729 --> 25:58.972
I have not seen an equal to that film.

25:59.352 --> 26:00.113
No kidding.

26:00.133 --> 26:00.533
Yeah.

26:00.952 --> 26:02.554
This is the piano.

26:02.674 --> 26:04.416
The piano.

26:04.436 --> 26:12.145
The ending sucks, but I think they needed it to get a world distribution on it, you know, happy ending and all that sort of thing.

26:12.165 --> 26:22.757
But Jesus, when suddenly you are inside the bodies of the protagonist and the villain and the...

26:23.378 --> 26:29.785
these pieces and could feel it the way... I mean, it was... Is it an original screenplay or is it from a novel?

26:30.306 --> 26:30.786
Yeah, it's her.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.028
Because I'd love to see it.

26:32.088 --> 26:37.373
I'd love to read it from a novel to see how that... You see Angel at the Table, too, which is about a New Zealand writer.

26:38.234 --> 26:42.639
And Bear, for the first hour and 15 minutes, you're going to throw up.

26:42.699 --> 26:48.005
But then all of a sudden, she's nailed you.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.327
She's got... She's unique talent.

26:51.449 --> 26:52.390
Speaking of...

26:52.606 --> 26:59.874
you know, talent and capturing the audience or the reader, do you have a sense of your readership, who you're writing these books for?

26:59.894 --> 27:13.028
Well, you know, I hate to be modest at my age, but I have a big love affair with my readers.

27:13.208 --> 27:17.753
I mean, I got a letter... Are you modest or immodest?

27:18.897 --> 27:21.621
Well, it's bashful.

27:21.701 --> 27:30.473
I mean, someone, an admiral, gave a copy of Redemption to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

27:32.055 --> 27:35.460
You know, a friend of a friend said, would you sign this to Carl Mundy?

27:36.421 --> 27:38.004
And he wrote back a letter.

27:38.024 --> 27:42.009
He says, yours is not only my hero, but he molded me.

27:43.611 --> 27:46.696
Well, you know, that's the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

27:46.736 --> 27:46.896
Yeah.

27:47.078 --> 27:59.653
And then some little girl comes up to you, some little Russian girl comes up and said, I read through the night, you know, the illegal copy of Exodus.

28:00.013 --> 28:11.206
And I was here five years ago, a fellow by the name of Volbovsky was in one of these hotels on a Sunday afternoon.

28:12.248 --> 28:16.933
And he was the guy who went to the Gulag for several years for dealing...

28:17.470 --> 28:21.196
in Exodus, in illegal translations.

28:21.857 --> 28:37.240
And when you've had that kind of a profound influence, and when you hear the word, you're my hero, you've got to, you can't go to the mirror and look at yourself and hold the letter up.

28:37.360 --> 28:44.912
I mean, because I have always felt that

28:45.449 --> 28:47.271
There's a lot of shithouse luck, man.

28:47.371 --> 28:53.837
I started out, I wasn't that talented, but I was very, very, very persistent.

28:54.738 --> 28:56.660
And the things that I did, I did well.

28:56.740 --> 28:57.761
God gave them to me.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.763
I mean, you can't develop these things.

29:01.144 --> 29:07.510
And I was certainly motivated by the Holocaust, if nothing else.

29:09.152 --> 29:12.435
And...

29:13.343 --> 29:16.148
I feel, you know, why me, Lord?

29:17.952 --> 29:27.730
And I feel as long as I work hard and am faithful to this craft that I'll be able to keep it, you know?

29:28.431 --> 29:33.360
But I'm just a keeper of something that I had nothing to do with...

29:34.454 --> 29:36.756
Except that I was willing to take the pain.

29:36.776 --> 29:44.424
I mean, and this you've got to understand, that this guarantees you a life of misery.

29:44.444 --> 29:46.426
Of satisfaction, however, as well.

29:46.446 --> 29:56.297
Satisfaction and misery, but when you're alone and you're hurting or your children are sick, all the readers in the world don't help you.

29:56.957 --> 29:59.120
You know, a lonely person is a lonely person.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.542
A hurt person is a hurt person.

30:02.197 --> 30:11.491
And writers seem to, because they're dealing in human emotions all the time, are enormously involved in this.

30:11.511 --> 30:16.719
And that's why we have this alcohol and suicide rate.

30:18.021 --> 30:25.673
As I say, when Hemingway was my age, he was already dead for eight years.

30:26.176 --> 30:31.372
I recently observed my, you know, Joe celebrate, but my 52nd birthday.

30:31.693 --> 30:35.024
And my editor, Alan Peacock at home, called.

30:35.586 --> 30:39.578
Not knowing it was my birthday, I told him, I said, what the hell do you sound so depressed for?

30:40.975 --> 30:44.219
I said, you know who died on his 52nd birthday?

30:44.239 --> 30:46.421
Oh, where do you read the obituary?

30:46.462 --> 30:47.343
William Shakespeare.

30:47.883 --> 30:55.112
I said, I'm just getting my first book published.

30:55.172 --> 30:58.496
I was teasing, but yeah, you said you've outlived Hemingway by eight.

30:59.637 --> 31:01.299
No, I didn't put it that way.

31:01.359 --> 31:05.003
I said when Hemingway was my age, he was already dead eight years.

31:05.024 --> 31:08.548
He died in 63.

31:08.608 --> 31:10.510
He killed himself at 63.

31:11.232 --> 31:14.576
And he seemed like such an old man, too, when he did it, didn't he?

31:14.596 --> 31:20.324
A very old man, and the writing finally beat him.

31:20.744 --> 31:26.191
But he didn't, he couldn't bring it anymore, as the pitching started.

31:26.212 --> 31:27.653
His own mind, he couldn't.

31:27.673 --> 31:35.063
Well, what happened, I think, is that he came face to face with his shallowness.

31:35.768 --> 31:42.439
He was a man that never really took a stand on anything, except possibly in For Whom the Bells Tolled.

31:43.741 --> 31:45.404
And he was consumed.

31:46.666 --> 31:51.313
What I think got to him was what I call Marilyn Monroeism.

31:52.495 --> 31:58.465
He was such a hot number when he wasn't writing that he had this image to live up to.

31:58.505 --> 32:01.810
And when he realized how shallow that image was,

32:02.279 --> 32:03.961
was he couldn't bear it.

32:03.981 --> 32:06.924
And this is really what happened, I think, to Marilyn Monroe.

32:08.525 --> 32:12.489
She was supposed to be the sexiest, hottest thing in the world, and she wasn't.

32:12.509 --> 32:14.692
I mean, she was... I sure thought she was.

32:14.892 --> 32:25.303
Well, that was... I did too, and I do today, but she was... But she was human.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.166
She was too human and terribly frightened.

32:29.447 --> 32:29.687
Yeah.

32:30.646 --> 32:31.928
terribly frightened.

32:31.968 --> 32:34.972
I have a special... And very, very unhappy.

32:34.992 --> 32:35.833
Very unhappy.

32:35.973 --> 32:39.658
Coming at a time when women were objects, whether you'd like to admit it or not.

32:40.439 --> 32:50.412
Oh, we've given the gals a lot of shit for a long time, and their reaction is like any liberated people.

32:50.492 --> 32:51.774
They're overreacting.

32:53.095 --> 32:59.083
And as we're talking about the blacks and the black march, it

32:59.637 --> 33:07.568
and whatever reaction they have is pretty much justified, except that their leaders are off the scale.

33:08.609 --> 33:12.214
I'm wrong with that.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.816
He sounds like Mark Furman.

33:14.176 --> 33:14.477
He really does.

33:14.497 --> 33:15.939
Sounds like a black Mark Furman.

33:16.459 --> 33:18.082
I see these guys in these uniforms.

33:18.302 --> 33:20.885
Don't those uniforms scare you with those funny hats?

33:20.905 --> 33:23.349
Oh, well, that's the African heritage.

33:24.831 --> 33:26.132
Look, we wear yarmulkes.

33:26.273 --> 33:28.075
I mean, that's not... I don't...

33:28.426 --> 33:32.311
They're desperate for something to hang their hat on.

33:35.915 --> 33:45.828
But what emerges from this thing is, unfortunately for every Martin Luther King, there are ten Louis Faratans.

33:45.848 --> 33:50.614
The hero in the neighborhood is not necessarily a Cuth character.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.236
The kid with the nine millimeter.

33:52.777 --> 33:55.120
Yeah, he's a role model.

33:55.160 --> 33:55.260
Yeah.

33:55.882 --> 34:02.909
Bill Moyers did a thing on New Jersey and Newark about five years ago, six years ago.

34:03.390 --> 34:04.011
Yeah, remember that?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.973
Oh, man, it was chilling.

34:05.993 --> 34:18.225
I mean, the cycle of teenage pregnancies and the kid who knocked the gal up, it's got a half dozen gals who's knocked up, and goes around and collects their welfare checks.

34:19.727 --> 34:24.572
And it's...

34:25.480 --> 34:31.409
I read an interesting thing by a black guy.

34:31.429 --> 34:35.896
He said, when I walk out in the street, I dress fairly nice.

34:35.916 --> 34:41.064
He said, but before anybody meets me, they assume the following.

34:41.284 --> 34:44.148
And he lists the whole thing down there.

34:44.168 --> 34:45.410
I beat my wife.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.954
I want dope.

34:48.114 --> 34:49.256
I want white women.

34:49.276 --> 34:51.319
I don't work for a living.

34:51.359 --> 34:54.424
I'm not a family man.

34:54.607 --> 34:59.532
All these things are assumed about me just by people looking at me.

34:59.572 --> 35:02.755
Now, how do they carry that around without exploding?

35:05.558 --> 35:11.404
And I remember also, personally, it comes to me, it's not an abstract thing.

35:11.544 --> 35:23.837
I was raised by a left-wing family, and I remember the Scottsboro Boys in Alabama, you know, the 10, 12 boys who were, they were really...

35:24.762 --> 35:30.450
had a rigged case against them, supposed to have raped this hooker.

35:30.810 --> 35:32.252
I know the story, yeah.

35:32.272 --> 35:39.702
And they've been getting this shit from us for 300 years.

35:40.383 --> 35:47.493
Yeah, but, you know, I think the time reaches a point where... Yeah, but you can't say... You can't blame me.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.254
Don't blame me.

35:48.274 --> 35:50.417
No, I don't want to go to the Caribbean.

35:50.497 --> 35:52.980
I went to Jamaica, and I said, buddy...

35:53.247 --> 35:55.030
I didn't do this to you, you know.

35:55.050 --> 35:56.813
All I did was come down here to swim.

35:57.935 --> 36:00.259
Yeah, I mean, my parents came from Greece, for Christ's sake.

36:00.279 --> 36:02.443
They weren't even here.

36:02.463 --> 36:07.151
That's, you know, we understand that, but you got to understand their legacy.

36:08.233 --> 36:12.079
And just as my legacy is the Holocaust.

36:13.161 --> 36:17.128
I'll never get over the Holocaust, even though I was not personally involved in it.

36:17.733 --> 36:25.524
But because I was a Jew, I mean, you know, when I see a guy like Farrakhan, this is really bothering me.

36:26.846 --> 36:32.774
To claim there's a black holocaust, though, I think, is to belittle the real holocaust.

36:33.655 --> 36:34.676
No, but no, no.

36:35.357 --> 36:47.554
What I'm saying is that to hear gutter talk like this in America in front of a million men

36:48.175 --> 36:50.117
is not comforting.

36:50.178 --> 36:56.966
Well, if they go back to assuming... Actually, the Greeks did it, not the Jews.

36:56.986 --> 36:57.647
Okay.

37:00.250 --> 37:06.058
Okay, I didn't like the Turks when you were talking about the Turks.

37:06.078 --> 37:10.263
Oh, yeah, well, that's a whole other story.

37:12.206 --> 37:14.348
Briefly, what time is your next interview?

37:14.428 --> 37:15.570
I think it's an 11.

37:15.610 --> 37:18.013
Let's go until the phone number.

37:18.466 --> 37:19.507
So get to the point, Nick.

37:20.268 --> 37:25.896
Briefly, what I want is a sense of, because as you indicated, you... That's actually, go ahead.

37:25.996 --> 37:26.777
I'm taking notes.

37:27.198 --> 37:28.259
That's a telling, actually.

37:28.279 --> 37:28.740
Go ahead.

37:28.760 --> 37:29.641
But I'm taking notes.

37:29.661 --> 37:33.346
So, you know, there was a foundation there.

37:34.608 --> 37:40.656
And the same as when my outfit went to Saipan and they got butchered.

37:40.676 --> 37:41.757
So I took that...

37:42.530 --> 38:00.755
You remember, I guess it was Arthur Miller's Home of the Brave, where I was guilty because I was Jewish, and then I left my battalion, and, you know, the whole... So I wrote Battle Cry as an atonement.

38:01.596 --> 38:01.936
Really?

38:02.497 --> 38:09.487
And then I wrote Exodus as an atonement, because when the Holocaust, when I learned of the Holocaust.

38:09.507 --> 38:12.030
So these were...

38:13.225 --> 38:23.296
My way of paying my passage in life.

38:23.477 --> 38:30.725
I had to get rid of these things that were distressing me, and thank God I could do it through my writing.

38:30.745 --> 38:34.329
Did you ever expect the kind of response?

38:34.349 --> 38:36.171
Actually, this is a modern classic.

38:36.191 --> 38:37.332
Let's face it.

38:37.512 --> 38:38.754
I knew what I had.

38:39.314 --> 38:39.675
You did?

38:39.915 --> 38:40.836
I knew what I had.

38:41.727 --> 38:45.492
My only problem was how was I going to nail it, you know.

38:45.572 --> 38:59.072
I didn't have the range as a writer, and this was, you know, a lot of the book wrote itself very, very fast.

39:02.797 --> 39:10.468
But I certainly knew what I had, and going over to Israel at just the right moment.

39:11.343 --> 39:19.314
was bringing my family over, getting trapped in the First Sinai campaign, and the whole thing.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.116
Which gave it immediacy?

39:22.018 --> 39:25.262
Well, there's a funny story about the immediacy.

39:25.322 --> 39:33.694
The publisher would call up and say, you know, the Marines have landed in Lebanon.

39:33.754 --> 39:35.516
This has happened.

39:35.556 --> 39:36.237
That's happened.

39:36.554 --> 39:37.675
I said, don't worry.

39:37.755 --> 39:41.019
I said, whenever I write this book, the Jews will still be in trouble.

39:43.762 --> 39:44.002
That's cute.

39:44.022 --> 39:49.709
So, the immediacy is today, you know, over the Golan Heights.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.493
The immediacy never stops with the Jewish people.

39:56.016 --> 39:57.017
And it's recording.

39:57.057 --> 39:58.338
I'll back it up anyway.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.304
Once a reporter, always a reporter, I guess.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.281
carry another tape, you know.

40:06.602 --> 40:10.645
I just bought another machine, too, and I was such a rush.

40:10.666 --> 40:12.988
I didn't want to be late.

40:13.008 --> 40:18.133
My column runs today, so I've got tons of stuff here.

40:18.153 --> 40:20.615
The reaction, though, really didn't surprise you.

40:21.155 --> 40:24.138
And the fact that we're talking 30 years now.

40:24.158 --> 40:25.159
Let me put it this way.

40:25.239 --> 40:30.104
The reaction didn't surprise me, but I certainly was not prepared for it.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.527
I was not equipped

40:35.077 --> 40:35.858
to handle it.

40:38.801 --> 40:39.923
But I did the best I could.

40:40.003 --> 40:44.948
I couldn't say no to a Jewish organization, and I didn't realize how many there were.

40:49.954 --> 40:50.635
That's great.

40:51.236 --> 40:54.580
And then, of course, the events out of Exodus, which led to QV-7.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.761
I was just reading a book.

40:55.781 --> 40:55.921
Oh, no.

40:55.941 --> 40:57.944
Middle 18 is where it was.

40:57.964 --> 40:58.985
It was in the middle of 18.

40:59.125 --> 40:59.445
Okay.

40:59.465 --> 41:00.707
I'm sorry.

41:00.727 --> 41:01.708
And the events

41:02.110 --> 41:11.642
Well, 1918 was the second book, right, which came out of the ghetto, and then came QV7, which happened.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.806
Which recounted those experiences.

41:15.427 --> 41:17.089
Yeah, in Exodus.

41:17.109 --> 41:19.412
Just one line out of Exodus was the year.

41:19.672 --> 41:20.974
How the hell did the guy find it?

41:21.054 --> 41:22.096
Somebody found it for him?

41:22.116 --> 41:26.021
Oh, you know, it had a big sale in England.

41:26.121 --> 41:27.983
This guy was, he had been knighted.

41:29.009 --> 41:31.031
He had escaped extradition.

41:31.491 --> 41:32.893
Why didn't he just keep his mouth shut?

41:32.913 --> 41:40.280
Do you think people... He was goaded into it, and he was also... So it's really the way it's recounted in the book, then?

41:40.720 --> 41:43.863
It's also... He didn't think he was guilty of anything.

41:44.023 --> 41:57.096
You know, a lot of slavers sought God after a while, people in the slave trade, but he rationalized that he was at Auschwitz and what could I do?

41:57.136 --> 41:58.577
And then...

41:59.688 --> 42:09.840
bolstered with ten centuries of anti-Semitism, he justified the whole goddamn show.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.102
Quite an experience, though.

42:11.122 --> 42:15.828
And you had to show your manhood here, too, didn't you?

42:16.849 --> 42:18.451
Because you could have caved in a little bit.

42:19.232 --> 42:27.822
The offer was held out, apologize in open courts, and put in

42:29.168 --> 42:34.354
pay him a nominal sum, you know, 500 bucks or something.

42:34.374 --> 42:35.035
But to only what?

42:35.055 --> 42:35.616
It was face.

42:35.996 --> 42:37.178
Face, yeah.

42:37.198 --> 42:42.885
And I... It did take some balls, I feel.

42:43.005 --> 42:44.867
It took balls.

42:45.028 --> 42:47.230
It was the most courageous thing I had ever done.

42:47.270 --> 42:53.378
And I just saw my daughter as one of these women being operated on.

42:54.439 --> 42:58.264
And I still, you know, I have these beautiful children, 9 and 11, and...

42:59.240 --> 43:09.475
And every time I think of Rachel and Connor, not every time, but once a day, I think of the Germans and the Holocaust.

43:10.216 --> 43:11.198
Your kids are 9 and 11?

43:11.278 --> 43:11.678
That's great.

43:11.818 --> 43:13.301
You've got a whole new generation.

43:13.321 --> 43:13.781
Up to 49.

43:14.703 --> 43:15.965
I've got them up to 49.

43:15.985 --> 43:18.328
9, 11, up to 49.

43:20.620 --> 43:22.362
My kids are 12 and 14.

43:22.382 --> 43:26.006
They're just getting to be assholes now.

43:26.746 --> 43:28.048
Girls can never do any wrong.

43:28.328 --> 43:28.889
Oh, girls.

43:29.329 --> 43:31.511
Yeah, they got daddy right where they want.

43:31.551 --> 43:34.615
They got daddy right where they want.

43:34.635 --> 43:38.299
Well, the daughter of mine is a new daughter.

43:39.019 --> 43:41.001
A joy, right?

43:41.021 --> 43:41.121
Yeah.

43:41.141 --> 43:41.482
Bliss.

43:41.942 --> 43:42.963
Yeah, bliss.

43:42.983 --> 43:44.205
You know, I got tons of stuff.

43:44.505 --> 43:48.349
I had clearance anyhow.

43:48.768 --> 43:51.755
And I wasn't looking for top secret.

43:51.775 --> 43:52.905
I was looking for...
