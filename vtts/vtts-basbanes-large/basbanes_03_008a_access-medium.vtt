WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:04.114
Am I sitting close enough?

00:04.135 --> 00:06.377
Oh, that's fine.

00:06.397 --> 00:07.218
Correct.

00:07.419 --> 00:08.240
Don't even worry about it.

00:08.740 --> 00:13.366
And would you mind if I, as we speak, if I shoot a couple photographs to... No.

00:14.027 --> 00:15.569
Go right ahead.

00:17.071 --> 00:19.634
You've been at this position now for how long?

00:19.654 --> 00:23.880
Well, I've been at Yale Press since August 1991.

00:23.940 --> 00:29.787
Wow, that's... So, what is that, 14 years?

00:29.807 --> 00:32.130
I've been editorial director since 19...

00:32.347 --> 00:43.443
So you can really give me some sense of your thoughts on the university press, the role of university press, and in particular your vision.

00:43.683 --> 00:47.408
I hate to use the vision word, but you sort of must pray.

00:47.428 --> 00:50.873
I just love what you've done with the annals of communism.

00:51.634 --> 00:56.962
If you could just talk a little bit and enter the conversation.

00:57.002 --> 01:00.126
I've talked about these things a lot.

01:00.646 --> 01:01.287
publicly.

01:01.567 --> 01:02.388
A lot to talk about.

01:02.408 --> 01:07.034
I don't know how much time you've got or how much tape you've got.

01:07.054 --> 01:17.987
And I figured at least an hour and a half here this morning, and if we have to... I think it should all be premised with a view.

01:21.931 --> 01:23.553
Well, first of all, let me start.

01:24.114 --> 01:27.057
Start anywhere, and this is by the way I like to do it.

01:27.077 --> 01:27.338
Okay.

01:27.358 --> 01:28.459
Why don't we just...

01:28.844 --> 01:34.313
I'm kind of feeling my way into this project, so as you can appreciate it.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.878
I grew up in the book business, literally.

01:37.078 --> 01:41.485
My father was a bookseller for 50 years in Chicago.

01:41.546 --> 01:41.966
His name?

01:42.587 --> 01:43.349
Stuart Brent.

01:43.369 --> 01:43.629
Okay.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.636
And he had a bookstore in Michigan, who still has a bookstore in Chicago.

01:47.736 --> 01:48.177
Which is?

01:49.179 --> 01:52.144
David is executive editor at the University of Chicago Press.

01:52.564 --> 01:53.586
I've been in the book business.

01:54.292 --> 01:59.678
all my years of my father's door surrounded by piles of partisan review.

01:59.698 --> 02:02.521
He was having some sort of an autographing party going on upstairs.

02:03.222 --> 02:12.072
There were two or three conflicting feelings in myself that have never gone away by things I can't understand.

02:12.092 --> 02:17.277
And three, I have some deep connection to the life.

02:18.699 --> 02:23.404
The only reason I'm saying this is not that I think my biography is

02:23.637 --> 02:24.458
Well, I love it already.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.360
Particularly important.

02:27.922 --> 02:36.032
It is to say that I think that any view of the book business is alive with it.

02:36.432 --> 02:41.398
For one, Jeremiah Kaplan had a completely different orientation towards the book business.

02:41.758 --> 02:43.601
He served at a different orientation.

02:43.861 --> 02:46.244
And Alfred Knopf, connection.

02:46.304 --> 02:47.505
Mine came this way.

02:49.428 --> 02:53.172
And the idea that the party is always going on upstairs,

02:54.586 --> 02:59.614
is an important one for me because I've always wanted to get upstairs.

03:00.415 --> 03:03.159
And I've always wanted to figure out what Partisan Review was all about.

03:03.559 --> 03:16.118
And it wasn't until I got to college that I figured from the age of about seven to the age of 17, I had been pondering what Partisan Review was, why they were partisans and what it was all about.

03:16.138 --> 03:17.120
It really bothered you, I mean.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.041
It really bothered me.

03:18.121 --> 03:21.627
And why these things were piled up in the basement of my father's store.

03:21.707 --> 03:23.209
I couldn't get it.

03:25.619 --> 03:41.235
But in this store, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir came through, Seinkopf, Drew Gellington came.

03:42.296 --> 03:46.180
In this store, Gourvidal came, Tennessee Williams.

03:48.062 --> 03:48.963
I didn't know who they were.

03:49.784 --> 03:52.707
It didn't make any difference.

03:54.273 --> 03:57.216
Forty years later, I published Gore Vidal's last book.

03:59.218 --> 04:00.139
To me, what publishing is.

04:00.159 --> 04:02.181
You see, this is, to me, what publishing is.

04:02.321 --> 04:05.285
Publishing is not just books.

04:05.645 --> 04:06.746
It's not things.

04:07.967 --> 04:12.512
To me, it's a life of getting upstairs and joining the party.

04:14.574 --> 04:22.002
Of course, you know, the party isn't just a party of getting drunk and having fun.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.668
To me, the party involves people like Gore Vidal.

04:25.688 --> 04:27.733
It involves... To me, it's the party.

04:28.475 --> 04:29.217
That's the fun.

04:29.938 --> 04:30.700
That's the thing.

04:30.921 --> 04:35.051
And you named all great writers, by the way, too.

04:35.091 --> 04:37.518
I'm impressed by your choice.

04:37.818 --> 04:39.703
Well, these are the people...

04:40.021 --> 04:43.705
who came in along with a variety of nuts as well.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.068
Nelson Algren, Sal Bello was always at my father's table.

04:47.128 --> 04:48.349
Ben Hecht was always there.

04:48.369 --> 04:49.310
Is the dad still alive, by the way?

04:49.490 --> 04:50.331
He's still alive.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.655
He wrote his memoir some years ago called The Seven Stairs.

04:54.815 --> 04:55.456
Say it again?

04:55.476 --> 04:56.277
The Seven Stairs.

04:57.098 --> 05:00.421
It was published by Houghton Mifflin, then republished by Simon Schuster.

05:02.103 --> 05:07.648
Anyhow, that's to me what publishing is in a nutshell.

05:08.590 --> 05:09.371
In a nutshell.

05:09.451 --> 05:28.095
Now, getting to it via scholarly publishing has been not so easy, because scholarly publishing was always more or less a matter of publishing.

05:31.179 --> 05:38.108
You know, up until maybe 20 years ago, it was largely research that was done.

05:38.459 --> 05:48.509
by scholars in areas that were abstruse by definition, specialized by definition.

05:48.789 --> 05:50.431
Were you here when you got here?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.152
Yes and no.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.253
Yes and no.

05:53.393 --> 05:55.656
Yale provided special opportunities.

05:56.316 --> 05:57.617
And I don't mean to jump around.

05:57.698 --> 06:07.487
No, no, I understand that, but I think Yale was always a special kind of a place, and that had a lot to do with Chester Kerr and the original vision of what Yale University Press could be.

06:07.653 --> 06:08.714
There's no question about it.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.596
It was not the University of Chicago Press.

06:11.376 --> 06:11.917
It was not.

06:12.377 --> 06:15.240
It had a lot of different pseudopods out there.

06:16.041 --> 06:16.841
As it still does.

06:16.862 --> 06:24.909
As it still does, which is why I think it has a chance for becoming successful.

06:27.131 --> 06:36.900
Before I came here, I was director of Northwestern University Press, a press that had become defunct in 1981 when I was teaching at

06:38.045 --> 06:42.713
A friend of mine in the English department suggested that we do something.

06:42.733 --> 06:46.379
That, you know, and... This really generated among the faculty?

06:46.439 --> 06:48.463
Yeah, exactly.

06:48.543 --> 06:50.927
But it was really the brainchild of it.

06:50.947 --> 06:53.070
So we... Jerry with a G?

06:53.852 --> 06:54.653
Jerry with a J?

06:54.713 --> 06:55.174
Gerald.

06:55.454 --> 06:56.216
Gerald, Gerald.

06:56.276 --> 06:57.117
Yeah, Gerald Graff.

06:58.319 --> 07:00.583
The opportunity, basically, to do whatever we wanted to do.

07:01.064 --> 07:04.069
Nobody was watching, and we could do it.

07:05.180 --> 07:14.254
He had an interest in one set of things, and I had an interest in Eastern Europe, Europe, Central Europe, Russian history, and so on and so forth.

07:14.274 --> 07:15.616
Is that the backing of the university?

07:15.897 --> 07:17.018
Yeah, up to a point.

07:17.579 --> 07:19.162
I mean, financial backing as well?

07:19.182 --> 07:21.265
No, very little financial backing, almost none.

07:22.004 --> 07:23.506
Did they give you a list?

07:23.646 --> 07:24.587
They gave us an office.

07:24.607 --> 07:25.688
They gave us an office.

07:25.708 --> 07:28.410
And they gave you the authority to use the imprint?

07:28.431 --> 07:28.851
That's right.

07:29.071 --> 07:29.672
That's right.

07:29.852 --> 07:30.312
That's right.

07:30.553 --> 07:34.036
And we borrowed money to pay for the books, but then we had to pay everything back.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.158
And it was a ruse to me after 10 years of this.

07:36.218 --> 07:37.420
And you were a kid, probably.

07:37.460 --> 07:38.200
Pretty much.

07:38.521 --> 07:44.507
And it was obvious to me it wasn't going anywhere, because we never were going to be able to get out of a certain rut.

07:44.527 --> 07:47.170
And so I came here in 19... How many titles did you publish?

07:48.731 --> 07:49.632
The first year, one.

07:50.185 --> 07:54.129
By the time I left, David Counts Under the Skin.

07:54.530 --> 07:55.731
It was history.

07:56.252 --> 08:03.339
I had had connections in the literary world and so forth, but I just thought, well, you know, screw it.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.422
I'm going to publish what I want to publish.

08:05.542 --> 08:10.447
And so we started the Eastern-Central-European paper there.

08:10.487 --> 08:17.475
And lo and behold, I realized I was back in the party that I was with Piotr Swarovski.

08:17.860 --> 08:23.748
Susan Sontag and I'd been reviewing books and some of them and so forth, and I got into it.

08:23.948 --> 08:24.629
It was wonderful.

08:24.909 --> 08:26.231
It was huge.

08:26.711 --> 08:42.752
And the outcome of it was that we published a... one of which was, you know, The Diary of... When we started publishing these books, they started getting attention.

08:42.792 --> 08:47.158
Now, you have to understand, Little Northwestern University Press was publishing...

08:48.202 --> 08:49.103
Eight books a year.

08:49.604 --> 08:52.206
Of the eight, six of them were being reviewed in the New York Times.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.470
It was unbelievably cool.

08:55.490 --> 08:56.832
It was unbelievably cool.

08:57.092 --> 09:03.479
And we were sort of the darling of the intellectual New York crowd.

09:04.340 --> 09:17.635
And in addition to this, my wife and I started a literary magazine, Formations, where we published work from Eastern Central Europe, along with other things,

09:18.053 --> 09:20.276
And so, this was our first issue.

09:20.757 --> 09:27.266
We published Arnosh Lustig, Shkvoretsky, Kundera, Ludwig Watzilic.

09:27.286 --> 09:28.247
It was unbelievable.

09:28.628 --> 09:30.210
People went nuts when they saw this.

09:30.350 --> 09:34.816
And we published the work of this extraordinary Polish artist.

09:35.157 --> 09:43.048
And so, Philip Roth got people like Susan Sontag and Cynthia Ozick, got a contribution from

09:43.957 --> 09:44.538
Mario Puzo.

09:44.558 --> 09:46.280
Mario Puzo even sent us money.

09:47.742 --> 09:49.825
John Updike, Mario Puzo.

09:50.005 --> 09:50.706
Mario Puzo.

09:50.787 --> 09:52.709
No, because Philip Roth asked him to.

09:52.729 --> 09:56.194
He said, look, there's this fantastic little thing going on in Chicago.

09:56.234 --> 09:56.955
Nobody's heard of it.

09:56.975 --> 09:57.857
They need to do it.

09:59.038 --> 10:00.660
Have you crossed the Rubicon at this point?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.623
I mean, teaching is now behind you publishing it.

10:02.663 --> 10:04.886
Well, as it happens, I'm teaching again.

10:04.906 --> 10:06.769
I teach a course up at Bard College.

10:08.271 --> 10:09.273
It keeps you sharp.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.234
I enjoy it.

10:10.274 --> 10:10.675
I love it.

10:10.695 --> 10:11.736
I love being with kids.

10:12.374 --> 10:16.599
and teaching you is that this created a world for me.

10:17.420 --> 10:28.294
And in 1991, in April, after we had published a Hungarian issue, oh, and one of the people we published, you know, just by happens, was Imre Kirffes.

10:28.655 --> 10:32.239
We published his book before the Nobel Prize two years ago.

10:32.259 --> 10:33.381
Wow.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.924
Really bringing this little press from nowhere.

10:35.944 --> 10:37.866
Yeah, we did it.

10:37.966 --> 10:39.929
And how is it doing now?

10:40.089 --> 10:41.571
Well, I'm gone...

10:41.973 --> 10:52.069
It exists, but Knopf eventually bought the rights for Faithless a year ago, letting this go, so Yale Press is going to pick this up.

10:52.089 --> 11:05.672
But the point is that we created a little world, and that's what I see publishing is doing, creating worlds, worlds of common interests.

11:05.692 --> 11:07.795
And in 91, in April,

11:08.112 --> 11:12.518
Because of the work I was doing in this area, George Soros invited me to Prague.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.482
He knew what I was doing.

11:15.502 --> 11:26.177
He was paying attention to it, sent me to Prague, and asked me to become director of the Central European University Press.

11:26.197 --> 11:36.111
I was at a seminar, and George is sitting here, I'm here, other scholars are there, and somebody, a Czech scholar, is talking about doing research

11:36.327 --> 11:37.489
in the Czech archives.

11:38.050 --> 11:38.691
So I stopped him.

11:39.071 --> 11:40.093
He said, the former government.

11:40.173 --> 11:45.521
I said, you mean the former government, the former communist government of Czechoslovakia?

11:45.581 --> 11:47.023
You are looking at those archives?

11:47.043 --> 11:47.844
He said, yes.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.927
I stopped them.

11:50.128 --> 11:51.289
This is April 1991.

11:51.410 --> 11:56.177
I said, we have to start a series and call it The Documents of Totality.

11:56.197 --> 12:04.950
There's got to be something important in those archives worth publishing, worth knowing.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.464
I wasn't a historian, but I knew this literature.

12:09.164 --> 12:11.487
I knew the writing of Danilo Kish.

12:11.507 --> 12:13.950
I knew the writing of all of those Czech writers.

12:14.110 --> 12:18.695
I knew history, literary history.

12:18.715 --> 12:20.096
I knew about Prague Spring.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.418
I knew about the Hungarian.

12:21.438 --> 12:23.740
You know, there had to be stuff in the right time.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.803
To use the cliché, you were the right person at the right time.

12:25.883 --> 12:26.864
At the right time, exactly.

12:26.884 --> 12:27.745
In the right place.

12:27.925 --> 12:32.490
And so Soros said, fine, you come up with the ideas, I'll come up with them.

12:32.656 --> 12:44.509
That those are only a handful of the news stories that came out when we published the first book in this series.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.472
It was a bombshell worldwide.

12:47.993 --> 12:56.522
And that came, you see, out of my sitting in the basement in my store when I was six years old with stacks of partisan review all around me.

12:57.123 --> 12:58.024
That's where it came from.

12:58.124 --> 13:01.127
It didn't come out of sitting in an office and thinking about anything.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.189
To me, that's what publishing is.

13:03.289 --> 13:12.801
If you take that away from publishing, you have a completely sterile, meaningless, sort of non-interesting world.

13:13.161 --> 13:17.927
But that came out of sitting in my father's basement.

13:18.869 --> 13:31.705
And that has now led to, you know, we've now published about 15, 18 books in the series.

13:33.389 --> 13:45.443
The publication of this book, The Secret World of American Communism, produced the opening up of the Venona files.

13:46.444 --> 13:55.434
Now, the Venona files were something that was known to only a handful of people in the United States.

13:56.335 --> 14:01.040
One of the people it was known to was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

14:01.060 --> 14:02.822
And Moynihan called me.

14:03.680 --> 14:10.149
He wrote me a letter, out of the blue, praising the publication of this book and suggesting that we get together.

14:10.169 --> 14:16.358
He called Harvey Clare and John Haynes and invited them to come down to Washington to testify.

14:16.959 --> 14:17.219
Why?

14:17.520 --> 14:33.282
In the publication of this book, which was based on the opening up of the Soviet archives and the project that we had going, what we published in that first book

14:34.173 --> 14:51.438
plain text originals of messages that had been encoded by Soviet cryptologists and sent to the Soviet embassy in Washington and the Soviet consulate in New York City in the 30th.

14:51.759 --> 14:54.763
The Venona Project had been trying for 40 years.

14:55.165 --> 14:58.652
Just for the sake of my tape, explain who Soros is here.

14:59.093 --> 15:00.035
George Soros.

15:00.256 --> 15:08.733
This is the financier, George Soros, the guy who started Quantum Fund, the multi-billionaire.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.501
Is he in a position to open up these files for you?

15:13.203 --> 15:15.267
He just got me to Prague.

15:15.668 --> 15:17.211
And he had the same money.

15:17.231 --> 15:18.935
He's the enabler to use the jargon of time.

15:18.955 --> 15:19.336
Yeah.

15:19.356 --> 15:26.892
And he was, he started it up just by virtue of saying, yeah, it's a good idea.

15:26.912 --> 15:28.876
And this, this... So he backed it?

15:28.896 --> 15:30.199
He backed it, initially.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.442
With money?

15:31.522 --> 15:31.983
With money.

15:32.404 --> 15:34.909
From the... A sum that you can tell me, or...

15:35.395 --> 15:35.896
$36,000.

15:36.576 --> 15:37.137
It wasn't much.

15:37.217 --> 15:37.777
Chump change.

15:38.038 --> 15:38.778
Chump change.

15:38.798 --> 15:40.820
But it was all I needed.

15:40.921 --> 15:41.541
For him, I mean.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.105
It was all I needed to get started, you know, and then one thing led to another.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.306
And what did that money allow you to do?

15:46.326 --> 15:47.827
It enabled me to go to Moscow.

15:48.508 --> 15:50.730
Oh, so it's really just walking, traveling money.

15:50.750 --> 15:50.911
Yeah.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.812
It enabled me to get to Moscow.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.575
It enabled me to meet with the Moscow.

15:56.076 --> 15:56.336
That's great.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.637
The heads of the archives.

15:57.817 --> 16:02.382
It enabled me to make the deal and have some sense that I could get more money

16:02.699 --> 16:04.041
and make this thing work.

16:04.061 --> 16:05.342
And what's your mindset when you go in?

16:05.382 --> 16:10.569
I know I, as a writer, I mean, are you looking at this as a writer, as an editor, as a publisher?

16:10.589 --> 16:15.055
I was looking at it as... Because you know a good story when you can smell it.

16:15.175 --> 16:15.976
Yeah, that was it.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.960
I mean, I don't know what the hell is in the files, but it's got to be good.

16:19.140 --> 16:19.681
Exactly.

16:19.741 --> 16:20.041
Right?

16:20.182 --> 16:21.043
That's all I knew.

16:21.063 --> 16:25.569
I didn't even know what the common term was when I got over there.

16:25.869 --> 16:26.049
Wow.

16:26.250 --> 16:30.495
All of my understanding of Soviet history came through Babel,

16:31.066 --> 16:35.472
And Anna Akhmatova, I had no idea who Vyshinsky was.

16:35.492 --> 16:38.796
I knew of Molotov only because of the cocktail.

16:39.056 --> 16:41.700
And, you know, it was... But I learned.

16:42.220 --> 16:42.621
I learned.

16:43.142 --> 16:43.843
One thing I knew.

16:43.923 --> 16:44.744
Oh, you learned very quickly.

16:44.764 --> 16:45.084
I knew.

16:45.645 --> 16:46.486
This is what I knew.

16:46.506 --> 16:54.056
I knew that when I was a kid, I hid under desks in the basement of my school because of the Soviet Union.

16:55.197 --> 17:00.364
What I knew was that when Sputnik went up, there was panic in my school.

17:01.070 --> 17:01.711
How old are you?

17:02.512 --> 17:03.253
I'm 53.

17:03.574 --> 17:04.475
Yeah, I'll see.

17:05.617 --> 17:12.568
But I remember sitting down in front of the television and watching the McCarthy Army hearings.

17:12.869 --> 17:15.313
I remember my parents arguing about Alger Hiss.

17:15.453 --> 17:17.316
I knew that this was somehow important.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.137
That's all I knew.

17:18.698 --> 17:20.681
But I knew it was of world importance.

17:21.162 --> 17:24.327
I knew this history had shaped losing going away.

17:24.610 --> 17:35.970
And the funny thing is, when we first brought that book out on Alger Hiss, The Secret World of American Communism, most people said, it's not interesting.

17:36.351 --> 17:37.573
We know everything already.

17:37.693 --> 17:38.374
Don't bother.

17:39.616 --> 17:41.399
Why bring up Alger Hiss again?

17:41.439 --> 17:43.443
It's an old, dead story.

17:44.845 --> 17:47.029
And people thought we'd sell 2,000 copies.

17:47.089 --> 17:49.173
People here at the press thought that.

17:49.193 --> 17:49.774
Close to 20.

17:50.311 --> 17:57.499
And it opened up the whole history of American Communism again.

17:57.699 --> 17:58.460
And that was the first one?

17:58.500 --> 17:59.381
That was the first one.

17:59.421 --> 18:00.022
Published in?

18:00.042 --> 18:01.604
1990.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.406
That's correct.

18:03.446 --> 18:06.289
You know, you can build a skyscraper in less time.

18:07.631 --> 18:09.252
I don't think that's a long time.

18:09.473 --> 18:09.693
Yeah.

18:09.973 --> 18:14.158
I mean, that's publishing.

18:14.746 --> 18:16.648
then got behind all of this.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.570
And, you know, I'm saying this because this is the way things grow.

18:19.670 --> 18:28.919
This is like a chain reaction and an opening up of the world university press and scholarly publishing is capable of what you think commercial publishers are.

18:28.959 --> 18:35.405
And this is a long way around to answer your question of what I think university press is able to do.

18:36.185 --> 18:39.769
A trade publisher would be interested in 20,000 copies.

18:40.089 --> 18:41.710
But not the underlying idea.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.572
But there's too much of a risk.

18:43.889 --> 18:47.754
Too much of a roll of the dice writing on that one.

18:47.875 --> 18:48.315
Exactly.

18:48.455 --> 18:50.999
You're not betting on easy words on that one.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.601
No, you're not.

18:52.661 --> 18:57.768
And you're betting on the validity and the viability of ideas.

18:58.549 --> 18:59.691
That's what I liked about it.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.295
I said to myself, these are ideas.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.196
Offering encouragement.

19:03.717 --> 19:05.539
He opened up the Venona files.

19:05.980 --> 19:11.888
He had the authority in, well, he, Claire and John Haynes,

19:12.323 --> 19:24.262
He got the head of the CIA and the head of the FBI together, and they listened to what Claire and Haynes said, and they came to the conclusion, there's no point in keeping this stuff secret anymore because the jig is up.

19:24.643 --> 19:26.566
The stuff is going to be coming out of Moscow.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.010
How can we be keeping it secret over here?

19:29.551 --> 19:38.365
And so he convinced them to open it up, and these files proved the spy scare in the 50s was not a fraud.

19:38.615 --> 19:46.624
that in fact there were over 250 Soviet agents working in the State Department in Washington at that time.

19:47.205 --> 19:50.789
And that probably is not even half the real number.

19:51.609 --> 19:55.314
It proved that Harry Dexter White was working for the Soviets.

19:55.494 --> 20:05.685
It proved that the creation of our intelligence was going on at a fantastic rate, right under our noses.

20:06.307 --> 20:07.808
I mean, that's what this did.

20:07.868 --> 20:10.090
And therefore, it opened up American history.

20:10.110 --> 20:11.892
It opened up the history of espionage.

20:12.633 --> 20:17.937
And it was, to me, exactly what university press publishing can do and should do.

20:17.957 --> 20:22.001
The other thing, of course, that Moynihan did was that he endorsed the whole series.

20:22.061 --> 20:23.622
He put me in touch with other people.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.865
They sort of came together at the same time.

20:27.426 --> 20:31.549
But then Bill Buckley helped me raise a great deal of money for this.

20:31.850 --> 20:33.831
What general, like, from what kinds of sources?

20:34.752 --> 20:35.773
Personal column.

20:36.665 --> 20:37.847
Bill is a great guy.

20:38.107 --> 20:39.830
I am so indebted to him, you know.

20:40.351 --> 20:41.853
He is a great, wonderful guy.

20:42.013 --> 20:43.235
Is he somebody I should talk to?

20:43.355 --> 20:44.437
Absolutely, yeah.

20:44.457 --> 20:47.782
People who think that Buckley is just an ideologue, they're wrong.

20:48.302 --> 20:50.305
He's a very loyal, good friend.

20:51.547 --> 20:53.470
And he called me up.

20:54.672 --> 20:58.257
And he kept me on the phone from Davos, where he was.

20:58.678 --> 21:00.040
He kept me on the phone for an hour.

21:00.577 --> 21:02.059
interrogating me, basically.

21:02.099 --> 21:05.223
Was I a Democrat or a Republican?

21:05.323 --> 21:05.924
Was I this?

21:06.044 --> 21:06.985
Did you answer those questions?

21:07.005 --> 21:07.506
Absolutely.

21:07.546 --> 21:11.751
I said, Mr. Buckley, I don't think we have a single thing politically in common.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.734
That's the way that he said, fine.

21:13.754 --> 21:18.259
I think Yale has been perceived, I'd tell you, of having a left-wing agenda, of course.

21:18.780 --> 21:22.905
A left-wing agenda, and I think going back to Gaddis Smith tells me, you know, look at

21:23.189 --> 21:26.433
I forget the name of the author, but, you know, deal stuff.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.475
Yeah, exactly, and in the 30s.

21:28.655 --> 21:36.023
In the 30s, and nobody would publish elsewhere, but deal, so it's published here, you know, so I mean.

21:37.104 --> 21:40.488
So it's complicated, but that's good, because there's variety.

21:41.068 --> 21:47.716
But so Bill said, fine, I'm going to back you, and I'm going to do two things for you.

21:48.156 --> 21:51.880
I'm going to publish, and he wrote an article that was syndicated coast to coast.

21:52.568 --> 21:57.055
I'll be able to get that article, I guess.

21:58.297 --> 21:59.960
It's coast to coast.

22:00.100 --> 22:03.306
The last line of it was, send money to Jonathan Brent.

22:03.326 --> 22:03.426
Wow.

22:05.008 --> 22:06.791
This was published in the press or in his magazine?

22:07.032 --> 22:07.593
Everywhere.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.736
It appeared in the St.

22:09.756 --> 22:15.606
Louis Post-Dispatch, in the New York Post, because he had a syndicated column.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.047
Every place.

22:16.948 --> 22:18.431
So I started getting checks.

22:19.052 --> 22:19.352
Wow.

22:20.328 --> 22:22.050
And I'll find one check here.

22:22.071 --> 22:22.812
It's fantastic.

22:22.832 --> 22:32.806
I got a check from my mother's check with a letter, and a long letter saying her husband had been in the CIA and she was so grateful that I was doing God's work.

22:34.008 --> 22:42.821
And attached to that was a pink check to me, personally, for the amount of eternal life and signed by Jesus.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.007
You didn't surprise with that one, I guess.

22:47.027 --> 22:48.028
No, I'm holding on to it.

22:48.529 --> 22:50.031
I'm holding on to it, but I've still got it.

22:50.332 --> 22:51.033
I've still got it.

22:52.735 --> 22:55.319
But that's part of what I'm doing here.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.808
But it's a long way around to say this is why publishing is interesting.

23:01.828 --> 23:05.393
But how many other university presses are doing anything like that?

23:05.413 --> 23:07.836
I mean, you're anything alone, I would imagine.

23:08.117 --> 23:08.597
Very few.

23:09.459 --> 23:12.022
But this is what university press publishing can do.

23:12.983 --> 23:19.933
Bring up Yale University Press to a whole different dimension

23:20.116 --> 23:23.320
of history, publishing in history.

23:25.903 --> 23:33.191
And so Moynihan then sent me his next book to give you, and I was selling the paperback.

23:34.492 --> 23:47.187
And, you know, it's just opened up huge areas of interest for American scholarship,

23:47.453 --> 23:54.400
People come to me now and they say, well, now I can actually teach a course on this subject because you're publishing books in this area.

23:55.140 --> 23:55.761
Yeah, you're right.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.202
That's unique to Yale.

23:57.883 --> 24:08.873
But Yale, and I say this over and over and over again, and even though John Ryden, now John denies this, but I know it's true.

24:09.854 --> 24:14.659
I went to John Ryden in October 1991, where did he go?

24:14.926 --> 24:17.151
I don't know, another press director in America.

24:17.872 --> 24:23.525
Because people would have sat down with their calculators and they would have said, well, how much is this going to cost?

24:23.585 --> 24:24.888
Is this a lot of money, a thousand dollars?

24:24.908 --> 24:26.231
No, that thousand dollars wasn't.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.215
But what are the books going to cost?

24:28.235 --> 24:29.618
Where is the money going to come from?

24:29.658 --> 24:32.745
How many can we possibly sell at this subject?

24:33.065 --> 24:34.268
What do you have planned?

24:34.906 --> 24:35.627
I couldn't imagine.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.048
I can't imagine why this would scare people.

24:37.068 --> 24:38.009
Oh, oh.

24:38.029 --> 24:41.673
I suppose retrospect is... It would have scared everybody.

24:41.873 --> 24:45.277
I could not imagine the director at Chicago.

24:45.698 --> 24:50.643
What, an exclusive look at secret, previously secret files?

24:50.663 --> 24:54.647
The cost of translation, the cost of doing business with them.

24:55.448 --> 25:03.917
There were a lot of American scholars who were skeptical of whether the documents were real or not, or whether they'd all been doctored.

25:04.302 --> 25:08.609
And what steps did you take to ensure that they were authentic?

25:13.016 --> 25:27.559
Ultimately, the best step to take is to go and accept them as true when they trust with other materials that can be corroborated, and dealing with

25:27.877 --> 25:31.603
I've heard touch documents that I thought were stolen.

25:31.623 --> 25:33.345
You're the guy who's putting the deal together.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.186
You're the deal maker.

25:34.206 --> 25:36.049
But now, did you recruit writers to do this for you?

25:36.069 --> 25:36.830
Yes, absolutely.

25:36.890 --> 25:38.813
I had to recruit writers.

25:38.893 --> 25:40.135
I had to recruit scholars.

25:40.215 --> 25:41.778
I developed an editorial committee.

25:42.138 --> 25:44.942
Many people told me the project wasn't impossible.

25:44.982 --> 25:46.885
There are too many files, and so on and so forth.

25:46.925 --> 25:51.572
I said, well, you know, if we have little teams who go in there and research,

25:51.974 --> 25:56.818
and come up with materials and then develop them into specific kinds of things.

25:56.838 --> 26:00.362
Did these people have to go spend extended periods of time in Russia?

26:00.442 --> 26:01.002
Yeah, exactly.

26:01.062 --> 26:01.243
They did.

26:01.323 --> 26:02.644
And I had to pay for them.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.366
And so I had to raise a huge amount of money.

26:05.386 --> 26:06.467
How much money did you have to raise?

26:07.048 --> 26:07.969
Over a million dollars.

26:08.910 --> 26:11.112
And I'm in the process of raising more now.

26:12.673 --> 26:15.776
And I got money from individuals.

26:16.477 --> 26:20.260
Bill Buckley invited me on his television program.

26:21.151 --> 26:22.413
And I called him up.

26:22.473 --> 26:25.238
I said, Mr. Young.

26:25.258 --> 26:29.284
And if Bill is behind it, then it's got to be good.

26:29.304 --> 26:30.186
Can you believe this?

26:30.526 --> 26:35.294
It's amazing because you have Monaghan and you have Buckley, and they are coming from two different directions.

26:35.314 --> 26:35.815
Exactly.

26:35.915 --> 26:48.475
And that was the beautiful thing about all of this for me, which was you could bring these people together under one key ingredient, and that's where the university stands.

26:48.860 --> 26:49.741
was so important.

26:49.761 --> 27:15.222
The one thing Yale Press has, and other scholarly publishers have, if they know how to use it, there is no commercial firm out there that has that any longer, with big German... Yeah, but if you think of... Yeah, I mean, but who else out there can you say, this is, you know, what was that expression?

27:15.674 --> 27:18.657
Wands are on milk is like sterling on silver.

27:19.618 --> 27:19.799
You know?

27:19.819 --> 27:21.300
Who is that about today?

27:21.521 --> 27:21.921
You can't.

27:22.221 --> 27:22.642
You can't.

27:22.822 --> 27:24.304
But you can say it about Harvard.

27:24.384 --> 27:25.725
You can say it about Chicago.

27:25.926 --> 27:30.110
And that's what university publishing has.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.533
Three very, very precious things.

27:33.514 --> 27:44.787
Which the problem is that along with that credibility, scholarly publishing has with it the aura of difficulty.

27:45.509 --> 27:52.939
of specialization, of really uninteresting.

27:53.360 --> 28:02.752
The task is to find that obscure where vision comes in, but opening the door to more.

28:03.393 --> 28:10.182
If a university press can do that, and I believe that American University Press has done that.

28:10.202 --> 28:10.803
Are you there?

28:10.823 --> 28:11.584
Well, we have.

28:11.699 --> 28:12.921
I agree with that.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.644
I've known about your books long before I was invited to come down.

28:15.664 --> 28:18.367
But see, we have done that consciously.

28:18.628 --> 28:22.813
That is not something that we have sought simply into.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.655
I mean, go figure out the art books.

28:24.916 --> 28:26.658
I mean, people publish it.

28:26.778 --> 28:29.922
That this is a province of a university press is astonishing to me.

28:29.942 --> 28:30.162
I know.

28:30.303 --> 28:34.688
And that was the vision a long time ago, but we have exploited it.

28:35.229 --> 28:38.353
I mean, I just went through the checklist for Abrams' fall list.

28:38.773 --> 28:40.896
It's pitiful.

28:41.247 --> 28:52.729
You know, I mean, I've been getting review books from everybody for 25, 30 years, including Yale, and your art books are absolutely... I mean, I can make the statement.

28:52.769 --> 28:53.491
I see them all.

28:53.731 --> 29:01.506
Not only are they beautiful, but they're scholarly, and they're important, and they're absolutely wonderful.

29:02.147 --> 29:03.610
The Abrams list is...

29:04.113 --> 29:04.473
crap.

29:04.594 --> 29:05.254
It's crap.

29:06.476 --> 29:09.119
I used to love Abrams' books.

29:09.179 --> 29:15.567
I liked the Abbeville when Bob Abrams often did Abbeville and it was Rizzoli's books.

29:16.548 --> 29:20.453
Rizzoli, I mean, talk about a publisher that has no credibility.

29:20.773 --> 29:22.295
Rizzoli.

29:22.415 --> 29:24.417
It's too bad because they did beautiful work.

29:24.477 --> 29:24.838
They did.

29:24.898 --> 29:26.700
But no credibility.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.402
Key verb there is did.

29:30.184 --> 29:31.105
Exactly.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.567
So, you know, that's

29:32.986 --> 29:35.209
I don't even fill out their checklist anymore.

29:35.349 --> 29:37.072
I don't waste my time on them.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.093
They're vapid.

29:38.674 --> 29:50.530
As editorial director, it can't all just be these wonderful cutting-edge, hard-edge books that really give us new information on international relations and foreign policy.

29:50.550 --> 29:50.991
It can't be.

29:51.511 --> 30:00.023
The press would fall apart if it's the scholarly base of our publishing program, as we can make it.

30:00.475 --> 30:04.399
And I think its program consists of between 80 and 100 books.

30:05.621 --> 30:06.362
Is there a crime with that?

30:09.085 --> 30:10.106
If we can survive.

30:10.306 --> 30:10.506
Yeah.

30:10.747 --> 30:13.650
And you were in the black last year, and you're going to be in the black again this year.

30:13.890 --> 30:17.915
And the reason we can survive is that we have this other end to what we're doing.

30:17.935 --> 30:20.417
We're also the trade program of the press.

30:20.718 --> 30:29.908
But I realized when the press sort of crashed in 2000, that the art books weren't enough.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.296
They just weren't enough.

30:32.037 --> 30:33.679
We didn't have a trade program then.

30:33.699 --> 30:39.046
We had some trade books, but we didn't have a trade program that had enough girth to it and weight.

30:39.968 --> 30:44.774
The academic program was just, from a financial standpoint, 2000.

30:45.335 --> 30:47.117
But that's for quotation, by the way.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.341
It's financially.

30:50.442 --> 30:51.263
You're fine with that?

30:51.323 --> 30:51.583
Yeah.

30:51.904 --> 30:53.966
I mean, there's no question about it.

30:54.307 --> 30:58.292
Any publishing company in America that specializes exclusively

30:58.897 --> 31:02.363
in the scholarly academic line is going to die.

31:03.024 --> 31:08.392
They have such vast subsidy that they can support it.

31:08.412 --> 31:15.724
You see, a general perception of a university press, the generic university press, is that it's intended

31:16.008 --> 31:17.069
to operating in the red.

31:17.209 --> 31:17.750
Yeah, exactly.

31:17.770 --> 31:26.719
You expect that its purpose, its whole reason for existence, is to publish things that should be published, that ought to be published.

31:26.779 --> 31:34.868
And by the way, we've got professors who are trying to get on tenure track, and maybe we should be, you know, we haven't published their stuff.

31:35.348 --> 31:37.270
And if you have a book that does well, wonderful.

31:37.731 --> 31:38.591
That's the perception.

31:39.312 --> 31:42.015
And that was fine in the 50s.

31:42.434 --> 31:56.672
the 40s, the 50s, the 60s was okay in the 70s, but the fact that Northwestern Press went out of business in 71 was a sign to a lot of presses that it wasn't going to be that okay in the future.

31:57.152 --> 32:06.324
The scholarly community got lifted up a little bit with cultural studies and American studies, and I think that's one of the best things that Yale Press ever did.

32:06.764 --> 32:07.986
What we didn't publish

32:08.422 --> 32:10.404
in the 80s and the 90s.

32:10.444 --> 32:12.266
You look at what we did not publish.

32:12.326 --> 32:14.309
We never went down the road of a Routledge.

32:14.709 --> 32:26.603
We never went down the road of a New York University Press or a Duke to solid, for the most part, solid scholarship, something that had grew up in this other stuff.

32:27.223 --> 32:29.025
It never seemed viable to me, frankly.

32:29.686 --> 32:30.247
Not really.

32:31.128 --> 32:37.635
And although some of the books sold well, most of them are on remainder tables now.

32:39.809 --> 32:58.875
those subsidies have dried up, and universities are much less willing to give them, on the one hand, and on the other hand, supporting a big publishing operation, sustaining it, takes more than most of the subsidies can cover now.

32:59.636 --> 33:02.780
Look at NEH, there goes your Mark Twain program out in California.

33:03.561 --> 33:04.062
That's right.

33:04.482 --> 33:08.888
I've talked to them, and you can do these electronic

33:09.273 --> 33:12.778
things, but can we really justify these things?

33:13.239 --> 33:16.323
You have a few of these projects that have gone on for 50 years.

33:16.343 --> 33:19.247
The Johnson, the Edwards, all of them.

33:19.267 --> 33:20.369
And how do you weigh in on them?

33:21.610 --> 33:24.294
They are all fully funded.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.016
So they're fine.

33:26.036 --> 33:26.798
They're fine.

33:26.818 --> 33:31.404
Roll for them if they're... That's, you know, somebody's got to pay for it.

33:31.704 --> 33:38.554
The idea that this kind of scholarship is a good in itself is bad.

33:39.496 --> 34:08.237
And it may be a good in itself I'm not disputing it. I don't want to dispute it at all. Something that is a good in itself doesn't necessarily have viability in the marketplace, and if it doesn't have viability in the marketplace, the whole organization is going to crash, and then that good in itself is going to remain ther, but it's going to remain in a rubble a pile of rubble, and nobody's going to see it, so we have to keep the the the basic

34:08.875 --> 34:12.459
foundation, the structure of the company, solid.

34:12.479 --> 34:17.824
So the likelihood that we will ever see a Lefty Lewis Wallace Walpole project?

34:18.725 --> 34:19.446
It's possible.

34:19.906 --> 34:21.068
It's possible.

34:21.128 --> 34:24.511
I mean, if somebody is as willing as he was.

34:24.751 --> 34:26.033
Yeah.

34:26.053 --> 34:33.280
But who ever heard of the idea that scholarship was something that was of commercial?

34:33.445 --> 34:44.159
I mean, to say that a scholarly program should be self-supporting is to... That goes back to my point of a few minutes ago, I mean.

34:44.379 --> 34:46.261
It's just... It was expected that it wasn't.

34:46.361 --> 34:47.463
It's self-contradictory.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.886
So then somebody's got to pay for it.

34:49.906 --> 34:52.770
And in the 60s, of course, there was a huge amount of government money.

34:53.050 --> 34:58.677
The Cold War kept the engines hot for American...

34:58.927 --> 35:03.953
competitiveness brought an end to a lot of public funding for all these things.

35:04.214 --> 35:11.984
These Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, MIT, Columbia, all buy three copies of any book that was published.

35:12.004 --> 35:19.533
Now they have the witches in the Nordic fairy tale that have one eye, and they share it among them.

35:19.954 --> 35:21.476
And that's what they do now.

35:21.516 --> 35:22.837
They buy one book now.

35:23.819 --> 35:26.402
The Five College Consortium up in Western Mass is the

35:26.703 --> 35:27.604
crime example.

35:27.664 --> 35:28.204
Exactly.

35:28.364 --> 35:29.566
Smith buys and Amherst won't.

35:30.146 --> 35:30.707
Precisely.

35:32.208 --> 35:36.231
But the book costs as much now or more to publish than it did 20 years ago.

35:37.933 --> 35:38.834
We're cooked.

35:39.554 --> 35:44.299
But the point is somebody has to pay for it.

35:44.799 --> 35:46.340
Somebody has to pay for it.

35:47.341 --> 35:51.565
And you can't get something for nothing.

35:53.086 --> 35:54.988
And if nobody's willing to pay for it,

35:56.183 --> 35:57.104
then you ain't going to get it.

35:58.166 --> 36:09.724
And it doesn't make any difference how glorious and how valuable in and of itself it is to study Marvell's diaries from 1627.

36:09.864 --> 36:12.528
It just doesn't make any difference.

36:13.209 --> 36:21.141
It may be the most important thing this young scholar could ever conceivably do, but it ain't going to happen.

36:21.161 --> 36:25.127
So you said in your board meetings,

36:25.327 --> 36:30.753
And so the worthiness of the project is no longer enough to justify its publication?

36:30.773 --> 36:32.835
No, we... Like University Press-like?

36:32.855 --> 36:33.375
That's right.

36:33.576 --> 36:36.098
And the reason for this is simple.

36:37.419 --> 36:39.201
There are a million worthy projects.

36:40.843 --> 36:44.847
But you still made decisions based on... Yeah.

36:44.867 --> 36:52.515
So we have become much more attuned to, does this project help

36:53.440 --> 36:58.950
construct a list, a presence, as opposed to good scholarship.

36:59.111 --> 37:00.293
Is it at the very top?

37:01.195 --> 37:03.639
Well, how do you ever know if something is at the very top?

37:04.020 --> 37:05.623
It's if somebody says so.

37:06.645 --> 37:12.175
I really cannot assess a book on Renaissance

37:12.796 --> 37:13.977
literature.

37:14.378 --> 37:15.439
People working out here.

37:15.459 --> 37:15.819
Exactly.

37:15.979 --> 37:16.700
Right.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.561
Exactly.

37:17.581 --> 37:18.582
Yeah.

37:18.802 --> 37:28.211
And yet, all of these people working out here have their own personal agendas, and they really know, but at least you have to do the best that you can.

37:28.231 --> 37:29.993
You have to do the best that you can.

37:30.173 --> 37:39.782
And so, we are constantly being accused of sacrificing...

37:40.201 --> 37:43.164
Give me, if you don't mind, can you give me an example of this?

37:43.184 --> 37:50.913
Well, from other, without saying who makes the allegation, but from scholars.

37:51.013 --> 37:54.917
But can you give me an idea, you know, what kinds of books they're talking about, the bicycle book?

37:54.937 --> 37:56.018
Well, yeah, they don't like it.

37:56.278 --> 37:57.380
I like the bicycle book.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.040
Yeah, exactly.

37:58.341 --> 37:58.941
It's a good book.

37:59.262 --> 38:00.623
I reviewed it, in fact.

38:00.643 --> 38:03.486
Yeah.

38:03.506 --> 38:08.031
You know, it's the kind of book that you wouldn't necessarily, a trade publisher, I thought, what a

38:08.281 --> 38:10.204
Exactly, but they won't do that now.

38:10.845 --> 38:21.159
But, for instance, there are people who, for instance, object to, let's say, are having published this.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.324
Or why?

38:24.924 --> 38:26.126
Well, it's not scholarship.

38:27.448 --> 38:28.670
Erasmus is not scholarship?

38:28.690 --> 38:29.631
See, it's not scholarship.

38:29.651 --> 38:30.933
Well, it's a scholarly way.

38:30.953 --> 38:31.353
Yeah.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.637
It's a great book, I guess.

38:34.017 --> 38:37.422
But what contribution is being made to scholarship?

38:37.542 --> 38:38.203
Here's my argument.

38:38.707 --> 38:39.589
It's very simple.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.394
And if this counts for vision, maybe it is.

38:42.835 --> 38:54.098
But my argument is that if you took these books out of the core curriculum of most, nobody would read Melville.

38:54.118 --> 38:55.180
Nobody would read Melville.

38:55.683 --> 38:57.605
And profiled in my new book, by the way.

38:57.625 --> 38:57.806
Oh, yeah.

38:57.826 --> 38:59.167
That's exactly what he said.

38:59.187 --> 39:00.309
It's the honest to God truth.

39:00.329 --> 39:03.272
The university is really the marketplace for so many of these books.

39:03.292 --> 39:03.673
It is.

39:04.093 --> 39:07.618
And we don't realize that we're living in the new dark ages.

39:08.038 --> 39:08.139
Yeah.

39:08.159 --> 39:08.799
We are living.

39:09.060 --> 39:14.927
And the universities are these little islands where things like this happen.

39:14.947 --> 39:23.578
And if the universities let this go, and we don't bring out a new edition of Erasmus or a new edition of Utopia, who is going to do it?

39:23.598 --> 39:25.420
But then that's my next question.

39:25.636 --> 39:28.941
Is this the only imprint edition in English of the title?

39:29.021 --> 39:29.462
No, it's not.

39:29.682 --> 39:30.102
It's not.

39:30.383 --> 39:36.452
But it has a good introduction, and it has books and so on and so forth.

39:36.472 --> 39:37.573
So there is a little scholarship.

39:37.633 --> 39:50.172
There is scholarship, and the point of it is that we are helping to disseminate this traditional scholarship, but we're keeping a tradition alive.

39:50.672 --> 39:55.339
That seems to me as much... But I have to believe that a book such as that is

39:56.753 --> 39:59.497
It's got to have a pretty good sale to justify its existence.

39:59.577 --> 39:59.917
Fair.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.821
But I'll give you another example.

40:03.542 --> 40:06.226
Newman's The Idea of the University.

40:06.446 --> 40:22.187
We have this series called Rethinking of the Western Tradition, which some years ago... ...of books in which we take basic texts and really subject them to...

40:22.977 --> 40:26.722
I'm just reading from the Indian University, again, John Lockhart.

40:26.742 --> 40:28.164
Yeah, you've got a couple of them.

40:28.184 --> 40:33.711
Culture and Anarchy, Social Contract, and so on.

40:33.891 --> 40:36.094
And there are, I don't know, about a dozen of these now.

40:36.114 --> 40:37.115
And is the name of the series?

40:37.215 --> 40:39.178
The Rethinking the Western Tradition series.

40:40.560 --> 40:52.495
The interesting thing is that when we, I mean, coming back to the idea of how much of this information is out there in the world, when we republish the idea of the university,

40:53.183 --> 40:54.604
There was no other edition out there.

40:56.986 --> 40:59.349
Well, that kind of goes back to the question.

40:59.369 --> 41:02.812
It was interesting, exactly.

41:02.832 --> 41:04.073
This is out of point.

41:04.093 --> 41:05.174
It means this language, right?

41:05.354 --> 41:06.415
Yeah.

41:06.836 --> 41:08.297
Now there is another one.

41:08.377 --> 41:11.059
I think Notre Dame has an edition.

41:11.079 --> 41:11.700
Which makes sense.

41:12.581 --> 41:13.442
They've raised books.

41:13.462 --> 41:13.682
Oh, yeah.

41:13.922 --> 41:14.262
They do.

41:14.883 --> 41:15.443
They do.

41:15.564 --> 41:16.344
And there's a lot there.

41:16.364 --> 41:18.907
They're a very tight little list, but there are a number of things on there.

41:18.927 --> 41:22.650
But it's focused, and it's according to the

41:23.457 --> 41:25.600
the mandate of that institution.

41:27.222 --> 41:35.553
University of Kansas, your idea of this series is to ask, in every case, why do we need to read this book?

41:36.074 --> 41:36.575
Who cares?

41:36.895 --> 41:40.400
Who cares about Arnold's ideas about culture today?

41:41.101 --> 41:42.222
Does anybody care about them?

41:42.422 --> 41:47.489
Does anybody care whether culture is doing what one likes or doing what reason says?

41:47.890 --> 41:49.492
So who inaugurated this?

41:50.573 --> 41:51.354
And that was when?

41:51.515 --> 41:53.397
That was back in the early 90s.

41:53.731 --> 41:54.914
And I inaugurated it.

41:55.034 --> 42:00.689
About the same time you're doing the pretty ballsy things if you're doing here at the same time, you know?

42:00.709 --> 42:01.491
Yeah, I guess so.

42:01.591 --> 42:03.797
But, you know, it seems to me— You don't think of it in those terms?

42:03.817 --> 42:04.980
I don't think of it in those terms.

42:05.040 --> 42:11.115
I think of it in terms of—I see the Western tradition as being under attack.

42:11.855 --> 42:17.080
I have a chapter with Harold Bloom and Ellen Fendler.

42:18.021 --> 42:21.284
I happen to agree with them, which is why I chose them for this book.

42:21.304 --> 42:23.646
You know, the Western tradition is not one thing.

42:24.386 --> 42:25.968
It's a variety of things.

42:25.988 --> 42:29.151
It's a self-contradictory tradition.

42:29.211 --> 42:37.378
I got interested in this through my work with the Soviet Union.

42:38.559 --> 42:40.301
I'll tell you something.

42:40.581 --> 42:41.642
When I came back from

42:42.365 --> 43:09.739
Moscow that first time, there is no more. Yeah exactly. Uh getting off an airplane surrounded by uh all of a sudden in an environment in which you cannot say certainly all of, the echo of a police state was still there, and I knew this was not Soviet Union circa 1978. This was you know in some way

43:11.103 --> 43:21.757
And it seemed to me it was well worth trying to think about what is worth preserving in the Western tradition.

43:22.939 --> 43:40.722
And not with a political agenda, but the leading ideologies of the last 20 years have been that it's really oppressive at proving that the West is just this colonialist, imperialist, and so on and so forth.

43:41.174 --> 43:44.186
things that are virtues in the tradition.

43:44.647 --> 43:46.133
This may be the only virtue of it.

43:47.037 --> 43:49.426
The toleration of dissent.

43:50.309 --> 43:52.618
This may be the only ultimate virtue.

43:52.835 --> 43:56.359
So did you articulate this at a board meeting here?

43:56.379 --> 44:00.043
Yeah, and that's why we started this series.

44:00.103 --> 44:05.929
And did you have specific titles in mind, or was it just a general conceptual proposal?

44:05.949 --> 44:07.571
No, we had specific titles in mind.

44:07.611 --> 44:14.578
I wanted to start with Culture and Anarchy, a work that is universally despised today, because it sort of stands up for high culture.

44:15.640 --> 44:19.804
And high culture has been discredited and kicked around.

44:20.054 --> 44:33.489
by feminists and by, you know, maybe there is something to just getting back to basic ideas as, you know, should your life doing what you want or doing what reason says to figure out what this is all about?

44:33.569 --> 44:36.853
And we're still thinking about this in different ways.

44:37.253 --> 44:40.176
We've put together some essays, some prose, some contra.

44:40.557 --> 44:42.759
And how many in the series, would you say, right now?

44:42.859 --> 44:45.322
I think we've got about ten books in the series now.

44:45.342 --> 44:48.205
And surprisingly, this lock has

44:48.725 --> 44:53.931
has pretty much outsold everything with the exception of The Prince by Machiavelli.

44:56.415 --> 44:57.596
Here are a couple more.

44:57.916 --> 45:01.881
On Liberty by Mill, Sesame and the Lilies, Ruskin.

45:03.844 --> 45:08.450
Yeah, I really am very, very invested in this.

45:09.331 --> 45:15.238
And I see this as sort of

45:18.425 --> 45:22.374
I think this is what universities are for, frankly.

45:22.414 --> 45:23.676
And they're all paperbacks?

45:23.696 --> 45:24.719
They're all paperbacks.

45:24.739 --> 45:33.177
There are four courses, and to our delight, we discover that, in fact, there are a lot of courses that use them now.

45:33.663 --> 45:36.047
Huge quantities, maybe 2,500 copies a year.

45:37.028 --> 45:43.959
Well, in some cases, we've paid for new translations in some cases, but yeah.

45:43.979 --> 45:45.942
Do they get a standard royalty, just out of curiosity?

45:45.962 --> 45:47.324
Some do, yeah.

45:47.344 --> 45:47.784
Some do.

45:48.165 --> 45:52.091
The editors do, but the contributors get flat fees.

45:52.792 --> 45:53.934
You know, I could keep talking.

45:53.974 --> 45:56.818
Tell me what your schedule is, by the way.

45:57.199 --> 46:01.425
My schedule is that I have lunch date at

46:01.523 --> 46:06.409
I have another interview coming up in a little while.

46:07.370 --> 46:13.497
So I realize that I haven't really talked about much of a vision.

46:13.517 --> 46:14.738
We'll have another conversation.

46:15.239 --> 46:25.250
But to sort of preview that, my feeling was that the press had to diversify its program.

46:25.270 --> 46:27.012
And you felt this mindfully coming in.

46:27.053 --> 46:28.214
Yeah, very mindfully.

46:28.234 --> 46:30.096
That dawned on you as you were...

46:30.633 --> 46:39.702
No, it was very obvious to me in the mid-'90s that we had to develop.

46:39.722 --> 46:44.447
I didn't know what the curve or the arc for the art books was going to be, but in the end.

46:44.467 --> 46:45.107
Has it recovered?

46:45.748 --> 46:53.896
Yeah, this past year it's recovered, but it was a very sanative form.

46:54.356 --> 46:57.940
We couldn't predicate the financial stability of this organization.

46:58.308 --> 46:59.450
on one list.

46:59.470 --> 47:04.658
That was a phrase we don't use, but... No, we have to have streams of revenue.

47:04.678 --> 47:16.295
And so when I became editorial director... Right, and so the rethinking books or textbooks... My daughter, who's a French teacher, knows your French textbook.

47:17.116 --> 47:18.118
Sure, French in Action.

47:18.659 --> 47:24.147
And now we have a whole bunch of new things coming with me, if you have a second stop.

47:31.163 --> 47:37.010
Well, finally, you know, it has taken us five years to get a program really underway.

47:37.531 --> 47:47.504
But now we've got some stuff here that will help to solidify the financial base of this organization for a long time.

47:47.524 --> 47:49.446
So we have a book learned.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.249
This is the first to read Latin.

47:51.269 --> 47:53.852
This is the first Latin textbook since we lost.

47:55.714 --> 47:57.897
We have functional, modern, standard...

47:58.568 --> 48:00.391
Arabic for beginners.

48:00.671 --> 48:00.892
Right.

48:01.132 --> 48:04.337
Ma-D-M-A-H-D-I-A-L-O-S-H.

48:04.357 --> 48:04.698
Yeah.

48:05.198 --> 48:07.842
And then this is Spanish for health professionals.

48:08.003 --> 48:08.123
Right.

48:08.143 --> 48:12.229
So we really are becoming our only specialized.

48:12.249 --> 48:12.630
Yeah.

48:13.231 --> 48:20.863
And we've got a beginning Italian coming down the pipe, and we've got a beginning Spanish.

48:21.283 --> 48:21.724
No.

48:23.138 --> 48:27.582
At the same time that we have those... I'll just drive you crazy and you see it.

48:27.602 --> 48:29.143
Give me the creeps around.

48:29.664 --> 48:30.605
All right, let's see.

48:30.625 --> 48:31.646
What are you going to do?

48:32.146 --> 48:32.887
Let's see.

48:32.907 --> 48:48.681
You know, we want publishing... Ron Kulka has started these with introductions by Harold Bloom.

48:49.962 --> 48:51.103
These are annotated...

48:51.404 --> 49:20.382
editions of Shakespeare and to our delight, we're finding that they're being used in courses now. Uh yeah design matters here. Oh absolutely, absolutely, and so that's another part of the operation that I think is really um uh this whole thing work which is getting the design credibility that we've got

49:20.834 --> 49:22.155
So these are tasteful books.

49:22.175 --> 49:28.182
I've written a couple of books, and my first one's basically written about special collections in universities.

49:29.183 --> 49:36.951
You ask, or you wonder, vaguely, do the things that we're gathering in some way support the curriculum?

49:37.151 --> 49:41.676
A university press doesn't necessarily have to think about that.

49:42.737 --> 49:43.858
Well, we do think about it.

49:44.078 --> 49:44.579
You do?

49:44.599 --> 49:45.259
Oh, yeah.

49:45.279 --> 49:47.922
And we're thinking about it more and more.

49:48.256 --> 49:52.040
Out there in an universal sense or at Yale?

49:52.280 --> 49:54.102
Well, in both cases.

49:54.403 --> 49:55.023
In both cases.

49:55.144 --> 49:57.907
But Yale is not representative of anything.

50:01.270 --> 50:06.977
Whereas Ohio State is representative, much more fortunately.

50:07.137 --> 50:16.407
I mean, it simply is the case that as people are much more idiosyncratic, they teach their courses in non-state institutions, they

50:16.555 --> 50:45.533
need to feel. When we look at a book like this for instance we have it revealed will be the Ivies, but we have to get representation from the big ten we have to get representation from reliable idea, and it may be that we will publish a book, that it will only work in the advanced bars at the Ivies and we'll be content to say okay we'll sell a hundred of these a year. Yeah? sure.

50:46.087 --> 50:51.077
Well, really, yeah, that will be it.

50:51.437 --> 50:52.580
That will be it.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.844
It's scary, all right.

50:55.004 --> 50:59.774
But, for instance, our executive editor in history came from Oxford.

50:59.794 --> 51:01.617
He had been vice president.

51:01.657 --> 51:06.627
They were planning for a Milton...

51:07.197 --> 51:11.822
They did the research that I'm describing to you.

51:11.902 --> 51:15.006
You can be an English major today and not be required to know Milton.

51:15.847 --> 51:18.810
That's scary.

51:18.830 --> 51:19.471
And Chaucer.

51:19.591 --> 51:21.614
And Chaucer is going the same way.

51:21.634 --> 51:23.055
Yeah, that's right.

51:23.376 --> 51:27.941
Mallory is... Oh, forget Mallory.

51:28.141 --> 51:32.887
Forget Mallory, forget Marvell.

51:32.927 --> 51:34.909
Yeah, but you can go to Brown,

51:35.615 --> 51:37.857
one of the great schools, and get a degree in English.

51:37.877 --> 51:41.320
You support yourself to be a teacher of English in Qualified Center.

51:41.340 --> 51:44.363
It comes back to what I was saying about living in the dark ages.

51:44.383 --> 51:45.043
It really is.

51:45.064 --> 51:47.225
We'll talk at length about that in my new book.

51:47.245 --> 51:47.726
Oh, yeah?

51:48.366 --> 51:50.949
Well, there's this illusion of illumination.

51:51.369 --> 51:52.070
That's the result.

51:52.570 --> 51:56.254
It's a virtual world, and it creates a virtual world.

51:56.274 --> 51:57.935
It keeps repeating itself, by the way.

51:57.955 --> 52:02.059
You might think you'll get 1,500 hits, which in some way validates.

52:02.499 --> 52:03.060
Right.

52:03.080 --> 52:05.282
But all you find is that they're repeating each other.

52:05.322 --> 52:05.622
Right.

52:05.973 --> 52:08.417
Misinformation.

52:08.537 --> 52:17.450
It's very seductive, I know, as a writer and as a researcher to say, I'm looking for this quote by Chekhov on being a physician and a writer, and they don't give me the source for it.

52:17.571 --> 52:28.728
And finally having to go to the letters myself and finding it, finding it really is somewhat different from the one that's out there.

52:29.549 --> 52:34.917
I still believe in books, and the reason I believe in books is I watch the behavior of my children.

52:35.740 --> 52:41.005
And when they go to bed at night, they do not take their computer to bed with them.

52:41.025 --> 52:44.348
The book, it's not a teddy bear.

52:45.389 --> 52:51.696
What else do you take to bed with you except for a book?

52:51.716 --> 52:52.156
A book.

52:53.157 --> 52:56.200
And when my boy goes to bed at night, he's reading a book.

52:56.220 --> 52:59.463
He falls asleep with his head on that book.

52:59.804 --> 53:04.228
In ten years, he'll fall asleep with his head on some young woman's shoulder.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.221
But right now, it's a book.

53:06.902 --> 53:10.585
And that book is impregnated into him somehow.

53:10.625 --> 53:18.092
That is beyond just a tool for extracting information.

53:18.973 --> 53:20.975
It has become part of his nervous system.

53:21.996 --> 53:24.118
Now, I'm not saying that everybody grows up this way.

53:24.899 --> 53:33.827
But there are still lots of kids for whom that is a very... My new book is a whole examination class and reach out and read.

53:34.381 --> 53:39.970
and this whole concept of pediatry, quite a really very articulate and brilliant woman.

53:39.990 --> 53:48.224
We were talking mainly about kids that are, have a greater facility, apparently many of them with the computer than they do with books.

53:48.244 --> 53:50.929
I said, would you use computers instead of books?

53:50.969 --> 53:59.022
She was in a heartbeat if they worked, but she said, try and get a six-month-old to reach out and grasp a computer and measure

53:59.221 --> 54:09.911
what a child who's being read aloud to from age six months to the age of five, the one who's been exposed to books, how much advanced that child is.

54:10.011 --> 54:11.853
It's all measurable.

54:12.333 --> 54:15.877
I'll tell you something else.

54:15.937 --> 54:21.722
I don't know all the data, and it's purely my own anecdotalism.

54:22.443 --> 54:25.806
My son's computer breaks down.

54:26.607 --> 54:27.928
He goes into a panic.

54:29.039 --> 54:31.141
I do, too.

54:31.161 --> 54:32.022
Yeah, they panic.

54:32.042 --> 54:32.603
They panic.

54:32.943 --> 54:33.504
They panic.

54:34.405 --> 54:34.805
Exactly.

54:34.905 --> 54:35.446
You panic.

54:35.546 --> 54:35.886
I do.

54:35.967 --> 54:36.287
Why?

54:36.667 --> 54:37.008
Why?

54:37.108 --> 54:39.070
Yeah, exactly.

54:39.090 --> 54:40.331
You do.

54:40.351 --> 54:45.357
You never... You don't have that kind of a relationship to a book.

54:45.377 --> 54:46.478
A book calms you down.

54:47.179 --> 54:49.561
A book calms you down.

54:49.762 --> 54:51.263
It calms you.

54:51.283 --> 54:51.463
Why?

54:51.483 --> 54:52.465
That's really very good.

54:52.545 --> 54:55.067
Because you are coming back in touch with yourself.

54:56.469 --> 54:57.510
You're coming today...

54:57.963 --> 55:00.005
wrote this down and this.

55:00.386 --> 55:01.247
I lost the file.

55:01.307 --> 55:03.369
Oh, God.

55:03.389 --> 55:03.970
I go nuts.

55:04.130 --> 55:07.134
A chapter that I've actually destroyed.

55:08.255 --> 55:26.517
Out of five books I've written now, I've probably had three chapters that I've totally erased through stupid work that you have intelligence to print the goddamn thing out.

55:26.537 --> 55:27.598
I have a high copy there.

55:28.253 --> 55:31.117
And I'm going to rewrite it.

55:31.157 --> 55:34.061
And I have to say, at every instance, I rewrote it better.

55:35.462 --> 55:37.065
You don't think that's going to happen.

55:37.585 --> 55:39.007
I know you're a busy guy.

55:39.288 --> 55:47.338
I'd like to... How about one question, and then a little critical mass of tapes here, and then I'm going to go through them.

55:47.759 --> 55:50.622
If you were... You have a great opportunity.

55:50.642 --> 55:54.868
You've been at the press for 1450, centennial history of the press.

55:55.269 --> 55:56.370
What would you like to see

55:57.025 --> 56:00.391
If you were to pick up, I think that I like to write books to people.

56:00.571 --> 56:00.671
Sure.

56:00.932 --> 56:01.933
I'm looking for it.

56:02.594 --> 56:06.060
I love taking on this project, by the way, because nobody expects anything out of it.

56:06.180 --> 56:06.581
Right.

56:06.601 --> 56:12.591
They all think it's going to be a little book of a thousand copies with the expectation that nobody's going to read them.

56:13.593 --> 56:20.805
Well, I think... I'm looking for stories, and I'm looking for... I think that Yale has a special history.

56:21.798 --> 56:24.441
at the right place at the right time in Prague in 91.

56:24.641 --> 56:26.083
I think Yale, we were in the 50s.

56:26.343 --> 56:32.290
But Yale is here now, and we're a way toward a new kind of university publishing in America.

56:32.310 --> 56:33.150
It keeps me here.

56:33.471 --> 56:34.932
That's why I'm interested.

56:35.413 --> 56:38.817
And I think that our ability to do that goes way back.

56:39.217 --> 56:42.601
I think it goes back to what was going on here in the 30s.

56:42.761 --> 56:50.910
I think we should have tolerated it was happenstance, but it doesn't just happen.

56:51.177 --> 56:53.781
You have to be open to having luck.

56:53.801 --> 56:54.582
We've developed that.

56:54.622 --> 56:55.683
I'm not quite sure.

56:55.703 --> 57:01.732
But part of it has to do with the fact that all University Press was the first publisher of the book.

57:02.473 --> 57:03.154
I don't know.

57:03.394 --> 57:06.439
But that is something that has to go on.

57:06.999 --> 57:08.922
Not ABC of learning, but ABC of reading.

57:09.803 --> 57:12.047
And we published Pound's other book.

57:13.709 --> 57:14.891
I can't remember what it was.

57:15.532 --> 57:17.334
Divigation.

57:17.354 --> 57:18.636
There are two books by Ezra Pounder.

57:19.021 --> 57:20.884
And you can find them out there.

57:21.004 --> 57:26.072
Now, unfortunately, found a copy of the ABC of Reading myself.

57:26.272 --> 57:35.387
Well, unfortunately, I showed it to a couple of other people, so I don't know if it's still on the shelf, but it's got to be someplace, because this is worth a million dollars, this book.

57:36.488 --> 57:40.575
And you will appreciate this as a bibliophile.

57:40.595 --> 57:47.205
Can you imagine a first edition of Ezra Pond's ABC of Reading, published by Yale University Press?

57:48.350 --> 58:01.427
Then, in 1941 or 42, because of Ponce, fascist director of Yale University Press wrote him a personal letter to be associated with a man of the... And will I look for this?

58:02.428 --> 58:06.233
Yeah, I think I can show you where to look for it.

58:06.753 --> 58:08.856
And we repudiated the rights.

58:09.777 --> 58:10.098
Really?

58:10.318 --> 58:11.279
It's not a proud moment.

58:11.980 --> 58:12.220
No.

58:12.721 --> 58:14.323
It's a stupid moment.

58:14.759 --> 58:16.722
But then we published it.

58:16.742 --> 58:20.386
I thought we were going to have a great moment of... No, it was a moment.

58:20.807 --> 58:22.149
It's not a profile of courage.

58:22.249 --> 58:25.834
Well, I mean, we repudiated the rights on patriotic grounds.

58:26.775 --> 58:27.496
So, I don't know.

58:27.616 --> 58:29.338
I guess that's a good moment.

58:29.358 --> 58:32.603
But the book went on to sell millions of copies, obviously.

58:32.623 --> 58:34.465
And not by other people.

58:34.645 --> 58:35.026
Oh, yeah.

58:35.346 --> 58:35.727
Of course.

58:37.009 --> 58:38.050
But we also...

58:38.536 --> 58:40.918
I love the story of Long Day's Journey and Tonight.

58:40.979 --> 58:43.681
Long Day's Journey and Tonight is a great story.

58:44.182 --> 58:48.887
We published Heidegger, Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics.

58:48.947 --> 58:50.088
I'm trying to find a copy here.

58:50.428 --> 59:07.526
Now, on the last page of that particular book, the second to last page of that particular book, Heidegger, that the spiritual, the inner, and I'm quoting almost verbatim.

59:07.546 --> 59:08.307
I wish I could find it.

59:08.658 --> 59:14.406
spiritual greatness of national socialism has yet to be understood.

59:14.466 --> 59:15.808
Brucey Press publishes that book.

59:16.469 --> 59:16.829
Wow.

59:18.452 --> 59:20.474
After having repudiated Ezra Pound.

59:20.494 --> 59:20.695
Yeah.

59:22.337 --> 59:22.637
Wow.

59:23.038 --> 59:24.300
Wow is right.

59:24.320 --> 59:27.985
So this is... How did you find these little... Tidbits on it?

59:28.005 --> 59:29.707
Curiosity, yeah.

59:30.388 --> 59:37.618
Well, of course, I had read Heidegger, and I knew what was in the book, and I was delighted to find that Yale was the publisher of it.

59:38.358 --> 59:39.440
And then you just followed it.

59:39.540 --> 59:40.481
And then I followed it.

59:40.882 --> 59:45.829
And it turns out that Yale was the publisher of that book because of the intervention of Hannah Arendt.

59:47.131 --> 59:48.553
Why would she intervene on its behalf?

59:48.614 --> 59:54.102
Because at that time, Hannah Arendt was trying to get Heidegger, after the war, to read.

59:54.122 --> 59:55.965
Why didn't we have correspondence here?

59:55.985 --> 59:56.505
I don't know.

59:56.726 --> 59:57.487
I've never looked into it.

59:57.507 --> 59:59.370
So, like, when, where would I, what period would I be looking at?

59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.513
I'm not even sure, but it's got to be...

01:00:01.763 --> 01:00:09.276
Well, you could go back and look at the correspondence relating to the original publication of Heidegger.
