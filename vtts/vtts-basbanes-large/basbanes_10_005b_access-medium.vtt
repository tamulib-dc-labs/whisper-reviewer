00:02.140 --> 00:05.364
Wonderful Jewish writers like Peretz.

00:05.424 --> 00:06.726
He mentioned somebody else.

00:06.746 --> 00:08.028
I don't remember who it was.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.633
He said, they did this heretical thing.

00:11.713 --> 00:13.956
They were writing in the language of the people.

00:14.016 --> 00:15.698
They were writing Yiddish.

00:15.958 --> 00:21.966
And all of the Hebrew elite, this was, they were literally outside the pale.

00:22.026 --> 00:24.109
It was interesting he used that expression.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.592
Yes, well, I heard him.

00:26.652 --> 00:30.257
That was over one of the radio programs, but

00:30.575 --> 00:31.697
He's a love.

00:31.777 --> 00:32.097
I love him.

00:32.137 --> 00:32.778
Very nice.

00:32.898 --> 00:34.561
He smokes incessantly.

00:34.581 --> 00:35.062
I know.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.123
He rolls his own.

00:36.484 --> 00:39.969
Well, I have, well, I still have, I had to dig out an ashtray.

00:39.989 --> 00:42.573
I still have his two cigarette butts out there.

00:42.593 --> 00:44.215
But he rolls his own cigarettes, too.

00:44.235 --> 00:45.077
I know he does.

00:45.257 --> 00:52.007
Well, that was the reason why, one of the reasons why I did it, because it was a, you know, roll your own, as we used to call it.

00:52.908 --> 00:55.452
And I hadn't seen that for many a year.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.402
But he smokes too much.

00:57.442 --> 00:58.423
He smokes too much.

00:58.443 --> 00:59.364
And I worry about it.

00:59.384 --> 01:00.004
I liked him, though.

01:00.024 --> 01:01.926
And he likes his beer, too, which is good.

01:01.946 --> 01:02.847
Yeah, but he's a love.

01:02.867 --> 01:05.350
And I always see him when he comes to the States.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.011
I saw him in Boston.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.593
You have to send me the gold.

01:08.613 --> 01:12.357
The rest book about the 30s is called The Most Thorough.

01:12.397 --> 01:14.419
The Cultural Front, it's called.

01:14.439 --> 01:21.806
Well, it's all, you know, around the writers, the musicians, jazz, drama.

01:22.227 --> 01:23.448
Michael Denning.

01:23.588 --> 01:24.309
CIO.

01:24.429 --> 01:25.590
It's a very...

01:26.060 --> 01:27.061
So anyhow.

01:28.143 --> 01:28.403
Wow.

01:28.824 --> 01:30.827
But you'll have to get hold of this book.

01:30.847 --> 01:33.130
I did an interview with her husband, Donald Hall.

01:34.513 --> 01:39.780
We're looking at a gentle madness with... Well, I won't buy it if you're going to... No, look at all that.

01:39.820 --> 01:40.541
Look, look, look.

01:40.561 --> 01:41.984
Look how many people have checked it out.

01:42.004 --> 01:42.184
I know.

01:42.204 --> 01:43.586
Oh, that's exciting.

01:43.606 --> 01:47.211
Oh, I always look.

01:47.231 --> 01:47.572
May I?

01:47.772 --> 01:53.080
This is... Well, I used to do that at... I used to do that at Wiener.

01:53.735 --> 01:57.082
You know, well, I would look to see when they were last checked out.

01:57.102 --> 01:58.385
Oh, we're looking to check out.

01:58.405 --> 02:03.134
I think this is so exciting for me.

02:03.234 --> 02:05.058
What a great thing for Ryan to see your book.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.423
See how popular you are?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.425
Well, what a great ending to being here.

02:12.445 --> 02:13.026
You are wonderful.

02:13.246 --> 02:14.928
But this is a very special book.

02:14.948 --> 02:17.311
It shows you how many book lovers there are.

02:17.331 --> 02:20.995
And there are other copies of this in the library, too.

02:21.376 --> 02:22.798
I know.

02:22.818 --> 02:24.560
There goes her name all of a sudden.

02:24.580 --> 02:31.268
She lives up the street from me while she's at the New Main on the top floor.

02:31.670 --> 02:34.094
Her name begins with A. You know who I am.

02:34.134 --> 02:34.815
Andrea.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.298
Andrea, yes.

02:36.318 --> 02:39.904
Andrea took out a copy, too.

02:40.605 --> 02:41.307
She has a copy.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.751
Actually, I gave a talk here.

02:44.051 --> 02:46.135
She was at the talk for the Roxburgh Club.

02:46.368 --> 02:51.415
last year, and I think she has a copy of it.

02:52.076 --> 02:56.822
I had a long meeting with she and Kathy and Melissa Riley.

02:57.082 --> 02:58.924
Oh, what a trio.

02:59.425 --> 03:00.346
Three of them together.

03:01.928 --> 03:06.014
We had a session quite like this one, as a matter of fact.

03:06.855 --> 03:08.577
Yes, there was so much to talk about.

03:08.597 --> 03:09.979
You can scarcely...
