WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:28.148
The interesting thing is to put all the documents on the web.

00:28.702 --> 00:31.205
Or the most interesting document, for example.

00:31.225 --> 00:34.889
Do you have an idea, roughly, how many documents there are in the archives?

00:35.149 --> 00:36.891
It just takes a wild guess, as we say.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.393
It's a lot.

00:38.893 --> 00:46.222
Of course you can't put everything on, it takes probably 50 years to put all these things on the Cd Rome.

00:46.422 --> 00:53.730
So my idea was, just to begin with the index, because it's all catalogued in here and in these other books.

00:54.082 --> 01:17.710
it's doable yes and you can type it directly so the people who buy these CD-ROMs can do a research on a database and which is searchable so it's not just images so you want to look for Kristina of Saxony or of Svezia and then you find

01:17.926 --> 01:26.179
You know that in the Archivio Massimo there is something about Cristina Svezia or you know that in the Archivio Colonna there is something about Cristina Svezia.

01:26.439 --> 01:27.481
Guides to the archives.

01:27.501 --> 01:41.022
So the second step is you call me or the Archivio Colonna or if we have a website with these things on it, just send an email saying I would like to see this, can you put it on the web or can you send me a photograph or whatever.

01:41.062 --> 01:43.967
Now when scholars come do they work in here, in this room here?

01:44.453 --> 01:46.196
Um, yes.

01:46.216 --> 01:47.417
No, we don't have scholars.

01:47.558 --> 01:50.682
I mean, they are all... We don't have children.

01:51.163 --> 01:53.987
No, scholars, I mean... Scientists.

01:54.148 --> 01:54.568
Ah, scientists.

01:54.608 --> 01:56.351
No, no, no, academics.

01:56.371 --> 01:57.473
Academics, yes.

01:57.493 --> 01:58.454
They come in here.

01:58.474 --> 02:01.459
Yeah, in here or in another room if they're alone.

02:01.479 --> 02:07.528
But normally, they're in here.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.292
Well, he answered the question because...

02:10.542 --> 02:14.527
what was on the index, they could have access to a copy of the material afterwards.

02:14.547 --> 02:27.681
If you want to look for something, let's say a Caravaggio document, I'd like to, yes, you mentioned Caravaggio several times, there must be some, now, what would the correspondence with Caravaggio tell us?

02:27.962 --> 02:29.884
Are they ordering a painting from him or something?

02:29.904 --> 02:30.785
Yes.

02:30.805 --> 02:31.606
And do we know the painting?

02:31.626 --> 02:35.090
For example, I know about, yes, we have a lot of paintings.

02:35.650 --> 02:39.655
Of Caravaggio, not anymore, because we don't know exactly which painting it is.

02:40.073 --> 02:46.402
But it was just written a painting of, I don't know what... Madonna and Child, for example.

02:46.463 --> 02:48.125
So we don't know exactly which one.

02:48.365 --> 02:49.787
Nobody knows because it was published.

02:49.848 --> 02:54.675
But I talk about this Caravaggio because it was published, so I saw it.

02:55.356 --> 03:01.124
There are a lot of other documents which I don't know and I didn't see.

03:02.026 --> 03:08.916
Because my... I mean, I'm not an archivist, so I... You're very seldom.

03:09.115 --> 03:15.000
Actually, I'm in nuclear physics.

03:15.381 --> 03:17.342
I'm in elementary particle physics.

03:18.964 --> 03:22.247
Where do you do this?

03:22.267 --> 03:26.391
You should tell us a little bit about this.

03:26.411 --> 03:27.612
In Rome.

03:27.712 --> 03:28.913
I studied in Rome.

03:28.933 --> 03:36.220
I worked in the United States on a cosmic ray project.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.021
Where did you go to school?

03:38.041 --> 03:38.802
Rome.

03:38.950 --> 03:45.592
University of Rome, third field.

03:45.612 --> 03:47.458
But I like all these things.

03:47.962 --> 03:51.428
I have lots of ideas, so that's why I'm trying to do this.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.792
This is what they call a retrospective conversion.

03:53.812 --> 03:56.857
They would have to convert this into a digital format.

03:57.058 --> 03:58.099
Yes, just have to type it.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.642
But I think it would just be keyboarded in.

04:00.063 --> 04:02.046
It wouldn't have to be scanned or anything like that.

04:02.146 --> 04:03.008
It's not all cool.

04:03.148 --> 04:05.412
No, I mean, they wouldn't have to scan it either.

04:05.432 --> 04:06.173
It would just be key.

04:06.193 --> 04:07.516
They would just have to keyboard it in.

04:07.916 --> 04:10.020
Yeah, you just have to type it.

04:10.287 --> 04:15.612
It's very difficult to scan this.

04:15.692 --> 04:28.385
No, the things you have to scan is all the documents.

04:28.425 --> 04:32.629
That's a 50 year project.

04:32.749 --> 04:34.952
But this is for scholars.

04:35.212 --> 04:40.277
So they know there is this document and they take the image

04:40.949 --> 04:45.494
What do you suppose that circular staircase was?

04:45.594 --> 04:46.715
What was the function of that?

04:50.840 --> 04:52.562
So that's a working staircase then?

04:52.582 --> 04:52.742
Yeah.

04:53.062 --> 04:55.665
You can see all the archives here.

04:55.725 --> 04:56.086
Can you see?

04:56.106 --> 04:57.467
I'm glad there are other manuscripts.

04:57.487 --> 05:03.194
Do you mind if I just take a walk up here and take a few pictures?

05:03.214 --> 05:06.197
The cats like it there.

05:07.223 --> 05:12.019
Thank you.

05:16.825 --> 05:20.190
Can you hold all of us?

05:20.330 --> 05:21.272
One at a time, Nick.

05:22.674 --> 05:25.559
It's an old one.

05:25.579 --> 05:29.545
And near the top, there's one step that goes kind of through.

05:29.745 --> 05:31.448
So don't step on that one.

05:31.929 --> 05:32.289
Just step up.

05:32.309 --> 05:34.713
And it's kind of... Nick, I don't know if you should come up here.

05:36.175 --> 05:36.876
You're coming.

05:37.077 --> 05:37.477
I'm glad.

05:39.961 --> 05:43.086
So here are the manuscripts of the San Vino.

05:54.828 --> 05:55.609
Are you all right?

05:56.510 --> 05:57.451
Yes, we're here.

05:59.272 --> 06:00.614
This is, again, Van Vigneau.

06:00.714 --> 06:08.101
He's very famous in the... Oh, yeah, I can see why you're... Watch out now.

06:10.123 --> 06:12.065
Give me your notebook, you know.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.386
Give me your notebook.

06:13.747 --> 06:14.267
I got it.

06:14.287 --> 06:14.948
I made it.

06:14.968 --> 06:15.528
I made it.

06:16.029 --> 06:18.711
I made it.

06:18.731 --> 06:19.392
You made it.

06:19.412 --> 06:19.672
Okay.

06:19.852 --> 06:20.413
So this is another...

06:20.849 --> 06:24.133
No, maybe it's published, I don't know, but it's all the original.

06:24.173 --> 06:26.436
I don't know if it's published.

06:26.456 --> 06:35.808
I had to ask... These are the original books we have from the Times of Anvish.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.511
So the book about our families was commissioned.

06:38.652 --> 06:41.976
Oh, so you commissioned it from him.

06:43.217 --> 06:45.801
These are just two more books from here.

06:45.821 --> 06:50.046
These are all the things which are in the Basilica of San Pietro.

06:50.752 --> 07:00.362
So the importance of all things, all the description of seven books.

07:00.382 --> 07:06.728
And this is something else.

07:08.870 --> 07:10.232
This is another one.

07:12.034 --> 07:14.316
This is another basilica but of Laterano.

07:14.736 --> 07:20.202
Because in the Laterano there is a chapel of Massimo.

07:25.868 --> 07:26.529
for example.

07:26.549 --> 07:30.313
But we have, the library is not in here, the books.

07:34.378 --> 07:34.718
What is it?

07:34.738 --> 07:36.200
Locazione.

07:36.220 --> 07:42.948
Locazione is a land or flat.

07:44.810 --> 07:47.213
That's family business.

07:48.054 --> 07:49.636
Yes.

07:49.656 --> 07:50.577
Probably land.

07:55.703 --> 07:56.784
Amazing.

07:56.804 --> 08:12.864
And as this is peeled away, something wonderful is going to reveal itself, right?

08:15.988 --> 08:24.478
This is all underneath now.

08:24.931 --> 08:34.522
I'm just trying to estimate the size of the room.

08:34.743 --> 08:53.385
10 meters maybe or less.

08:54.125 --> 09:10.626
And about... Something important must have been in here, I mean, to justify the painting of this.

09:12.148 --> 09:15.152
Well, we have paintings by big painters.

09:15.432 --> 09:17.575
I mean, Giulio Romano, Gerindel Vaga.

09:18.496 --> 09:23.743
Well, they were from the Roman school of 16th century, of Raffaello.

09:24.348 --> 09:26.991
I understand, but this room, we're trying to figure out what this room is.

09:27.051 --> 09:27.871
Ah, the room.

09:27.891 --> 09:27.971
Yes.

09:27.992 --> 09:30.314
To have brought in an artist and a school.

09:30.394 --> 09:37.501
I didn't know, but we have other rooms here on the first floor, on the ground floor, which are all painted like this.

09:37.981 --> 09:39.002
It's a palace.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.063
Every room is beautiful.

09:40.083 --> 09:43.887
It's every room here in the palace is close, close.

09:43.907 --> 09:44.648
Nearly every room.

09:45.028 --> 09:48.852
And how many, how many, like, is that, uh, cassette roof in?

09:48.872 --> 09:49.733
Yes, up here.

09:50.934 --> 09:51.254
And how many?

09:51.274 --> 09:53.376
The most important part is about here.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.309
And how many rooms are there in the palace?

09:56.270 --> 10:02.137
About... About... The palace?

10:02.157 --> 10:04.200
What can it... I have no idea.

10:04.841 --> 10:05.662
Maybe 50.

10:06.483 --> 10:08.645
I don't know how much, maybe more.

10:09.386 --> 10:12.710
But there are maybe 50, let's say 50.

10:12.830 --> 10:15.173
But there are huge rooms.

10:15.494 --> 10:19.178
For example, up here is a huge room.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.326
We have a huge statuette, a Roman statuette.

10:23.606 --> 10:29.536
I heard that there would be a famous copy of Doriforos in that too.

10:30.357 --> 10:31.098
Discobolo.

10:31.459 --> 10:32.100
Discobolo.

10:32.120 --> 10:38.690
The Discobolo was found in this villa we had in where now is Tassone Termini, Villa Palombara.

10:39.131 --> 10:44.760
Palombara was in Stavelli and was discovered by, it belonged to us at that time,

10:45.044 --> 10:52.812
and it was discovered there by this, by Favelli, which was a master of mine.

10:54.914 --> 10:56.135
In the palace?

10:57.016 --> 11:13.853
No, unfortunately the statue was divided in the 19th century and other things with the Lancelotti family and the statue went to the Lancelotti family

11:14.069 --> 11:15.831
So it's in Palazzo Lancelotti?

11:15.851 --> 11:16.832
No, it was sold.

11:17.974 --> 11:20.116
So you don't know where it is?

11:20.136 --> 11:20.877
Yes, yes, yes.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.639
It is known where it is.

11:22.659 --> 11:24.381
I don't know now exactly where it is.

11:24.421 --> 11:27.785
It is in the... The state owns it now.

11:28.546 --> 11:30.228
Maybe it's in the... The museum?

11:30.508 --> 11:31.790
OK, should we go down?

11:32.170 --> 11:33.772
Yeah, the kitty is here.

11:33.792 --> 11:34.293
OK.

11:34.313 --> 11:36.055
Should we head down?

11:36.115 --> 11:36.195
Yes.

11:36.344 --> 11:36.826
Okay.

11:36.846 --> 11:38.571
Do you want to go first?

11:38.611 --> 11:39.575
I'll try.

11:39.595 --> 11:40.799
Do you want me to go?

11:40.879 --> 11:44.852
Give me the tape record.

12:04.390 --> 12:31.461
Van Vigne is a very famous one.

12:31.762 --> 12:34.766
So we have here manuscripts by him.

12:35.307 --> 12:38.832
I have it, I wrote it down.

12:39.353 --> 12:45.422
So I'm sorry I can't show you these autographs by Caravaggio and others.

12:45.763 --> 12:47.385
That's fine.

12:47.405 --> 12:54.776
I think... I have to ask because they are closed in a couple.

12:55.597 --> 12:58.982
And now there is... My father's work is not here in Rome.

13:00.665 --> 13:01.566
It's too funny.

13:02.542 --> 13:26.143
These are photographs of the time and there is an interesting thing there.

13:26.423 --> 13:27.424
There is this story.

13:27.524 --> 13:31.047
It is still there.

13:31.786 --> 13:35.332
Like the Egyptian door, it is called the magic door.

13:37.255 --> 13:42.084
It was done by this big alchemist.

13:42.104 --> 13:44.488
It was a very famous one, Giacomo Della Porte.

13:44.588 --> 13:45.069
No, no, no.

13:45.670 --> 13:48.314
Di Savelli, Marchese di Palombara.

13:48.936 --> 13:55.026
And here there are some inscriptions, very strange one, I don't know.

13:55.293 --> 14:00.318
I don't know what they mean, with all the alchemic signs.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.721
And you can still see this.

14:02.741 --> 14:03.482
Where is it?

14:03.862 --> 14:09.348
This is Piazza Vittorio, near the Stazione Termi, because it was a huge villa like the Villa Borghio.

14:09.368 --> 14:09.849
It was huge.

14:09.929 --> 14:10.970
Villa Piccolo Melli, no?

14:12.111 --> 14:12.732
No, no, no.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.275
And there you can see still the Casino Massimo.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.137
Casino Massimo is still there.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.118
It wasn't destroyed.

14:19.319 --> 14:23.764
And there you have all the paintings by the Nazareni.

14:24.706 --> 14:29.352
There were all these German paintings, very famous, which painted like Raffaello.

14:29.772 --> 14:30.994
Nazareni they were called.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.517
Nazareni from Christ.

14:34.458 --> 14:38.944
Because they had all long hair to like the Christ, to recall them Nazareni.

14:39.225 --> 14:46.093
And they were again, they painted by Massimo, were all around the family.

14:46.113 --> 14:48.737
So they painted a lot of things right.

14:49.658 --> 14:52.041
But this is 19th century already.

14:52.161 --> 14:53.683
Just for this point.

14:54.153 --> 15:23.535
still there and there is all a story about this alchemic thing that another famous alchemist came to this villa and talked to my ancestor of mine and he said he had he knew how to do gold you know like the dream of the alchemist and he went into the

15:23.768 --> 15:26.331
The cabinet alchemist.

15:26.371 --> 15:29.574
The room of the alchemist.

15:29.594 --> 15:30.655
Yes, the room of the alchemist.

15:30.735 --> 15:31.336
Laboratory.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.677
Laboratory, yes.

15:32.697 --> 15:42.967
He went into the laboratory and the next morning, this ancestor of mine went in and found some gold.

15:42.987 --> 15:46.771
And this man, this famous alchemist, disappeared.

15:46.811 --> 15:48.493
There was no more to see there.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.312
And now you have the secret.

15:50.332 --> 15:50.812
Sorry?

15:50.832 --> 15:51.794
So now you have the secret.

15:51.814 --> 15:53.836
No, I don't have it.

15:53.856 --> 15:54.457
Nobody has.

15:54.777 --> 16:00.964
And he found these strange symbols which he let him raise on me.

16:01.184 --> 16:07.371
But the real thing was, like this ancestor, mine was a big alchemy.

16:07.391 --> 16:14.920
So this is the story, but in fact he did and he wrote some very strange things which we don't understand about.

16:15.119 --> 16:17.622
And your relatives, your ancestors.

16:17.662 --> 16:19.384
He wrote strange things.

16:19.544 --> 16:36.404
And he was the one who did this for tonight.

16:36.424 --> 16:37.365
Wow.

16:37.385 --> 16:37.465
Wow.

16:37.867 --> 17:04.110
You would take a picture of all the scenes there, and I go and do a stretch in the city.

17:04.130 --> 17:04.810
This is on the early 16th century.

17:04.830 --> 17:05.091
Outside, too.

17:05.111 --> 17:05.731
And outside, it has a new door.

17:05.751 --> 17:07.032
And outside, in the center, you find a photo house with Hercule.

17:07.052 --> 17:07.873
Hercule is running off the side with a...

17:07.853 --> 17:31.195
That's a picture I want right there.

17:39.511 --> 18:02.539
Ah, exactly.

18:02.559 --> 18:02.880
I didn't listen.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.240
Okay, right here.

18:10.274 --> 18:34.003
I have more facts about this.

18:34.023 --> 18:34.444
Tell me anybody else.

18:34.464 --> 18:34.644
Oh, what?

18:34.664 --> 18:35.245
I have more facts about this.

18:35.265 --> 18:35.605
Stand right here.

18:35.625 --> 18:35.825
Like this.

18:35.845 --> 18:36.947
Excuse me, Nick, but I want to get my bride right here.

18:36.967 --> 18:37.227
That's great.

18:45.610 --> 19:06.329
All right.

19:06.350 --> 19:06.750
All right, Nicholas.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.250
Stand over here with me.

19:07.270 --> 19:07.891
I'm a little bit of journaling.

19:07.911 --> 19:08.211
You're welcome.

19:08.231 --> 19:08.692
Yeah, I'm a little bit.

19:08.712 --> 19:08.952
That's fine.

19:08.972 --> 19:09.452
Come on, you're welcome.

19:09.472 --> 19:09.633
You too.

19:09.653 --> 19:10.273
You can tell me my little shit.

19:10.293 --> 19:10.914
You can tell me my little shit.

19:10.934 --> 19:11.554
You can tell me my little shit.

19:11.574 --> 19:12.195
You can tell me my little shit.

19:12.215 --> 19:12.836
You can tell me my little shit.

19:12.856 --> 19:13.476
You can tell me my little shit.

19:13.496 --> 19:14.117
You can tell me my little shit.

19:14.137 --> 19:14.757
You can tell me my little shit.

19:14.777 --> 19:15.398
You can tell me my little shit.

19:25.334 --> 19:53.673
When he was a child, very small, there were two kings that went to his villa, where he was late.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.053
Let's say he died.

19:54.073 --> 19:54.514
And as he was a child,

19:54.798 --> 20:23.098
Put their hands?

20:23.118 --> 20:23.438
Put their hands.

20:23.907 --> 20:49.074
I like that too.

20:49.094 --> 20:50.015
I want to get it through the lighting section.

20:50.035 --> 20:50.716
I want to turn it a little closer.

20:50.736 --> 20:51.096
I like it tighter.

20:51.447 --> 21:16.435
So I always make photos there and everybody else here.

21:16.455 --> 21:17.236
Let's see the council guys in the road.

21:17.256 --> 21:18.017
The council which I was talking about.

21:18.037 --> 21:19.138
It was the first of the press of Schweinheim and Vanna.

21:19.158 --> 21:20.880
And then it was taken because it was the old road through Fina which went through all.

21:21.232 --> 21:39.938
So it was taken from the first time.

21:39.958 --> 21:40.739
And it belongs to us from the year 60s.

21:40.759 --> 21:41.059
No, absolutely.

21:41.079 --> 21:41.300
Absolutely.

21:41.320 --> 21:41.720
I told you about it.

21:41.740 --> 21:42.181
It belongs to Seattle.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.062
It was one of these clothes in Benedictino.

21:43.082 --> 21:43.703
I suppose the one with Seattle.

21:43.723 --> 21:43.783
OK.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.284
What have you been told?

21:44.304 --> 21:44.404
Yeah.

21:46.274 --> 22:02.254
How about if I get a picture of you in the doorway here, like this, too?

22:02.274 --> 22:02.916
Okay, upstairs in the road here.

22:13.493 --> 22:30.709
... ... ... ... ...

22:36.528 --> 23:03.134
Oh, I see, okay, yes, I see.

23:03.154 --> 23:03.394
Is it right?

23:03.414 --> 23:03.955
So, you... See the Crestos?

23:03.975 --> 23:04.455
You look at the Crestos.

23:04.475 --> 23:05.016
It was rented to the one...

23:05.232 --> 23:21.808
You have to be a former leader.

23:21.828 --> 23:22.028
Crenel.

23:22.048 --> 23:22.188
Crenel.

23:22.208 --> 23:22.829
Now they move.

23:22.849 --> 23:27.453
What's up there down there?

23:27.473 --> 23:27.874
What's your mission?

23:27.894 --> 23:28.194
Articles.

23:28.214 --> 23:28.394
Articles.

23:28.414 --> 23:28.514
Okay.

23:28.534 --> 23:32.538
So here you have some other questions.

23:32.558 --> 23:32.919
You have to be in.

23:32.939 --> 23:33.419
Are you up to your desk?

23:33.439 --> 23:33.519
Yes.

23:33.539 --> 23:34.260
I remember some of the things there.

23:36.417 --> 24:01.381
Oh, look at the train.

24:01.401 --> 24:01.741
Look, look, look.

24:01.761 --> 24:02.242
Look, you look upstairs.

24:02.262 --> 24:02.682
Look at the frescoes.

24:02.702 --> 24:03.303
Fresco is probably full green.

24:03.323 --> 24:03.403
Wow.

24:10.623 --> 24:22.067
Oh.

24:39.158 --> 25:06.857
This is what I call my sentence.

25:06.877 --> 25:07.238
This is all Roman.

25:07.258 --> 25:07.858
This is Romero?

25:07.878 --> 25:08.099
Romero, no.

25:08.119 --> 25:08.980
You saw the impunable, the mystery of Rome.

25:10.276 --> 25:37.068
Prince, can I maybe stand right in front of that door?

25:37.088 --> 25:37.609
No, we'll hold the jacket.

25:37.629 --> 25:37.929
This is lovely.

25:37.949 --> 25:38.209
This is nice.

25:38.229 --> 25:38.730
Professor, main entrance.

25:39.166 --> 25:59.976
Are you ready?

25:59.996 --> 26:00.197
That's it.

26:00.217 --> 26:04.603
Can you look at me?

26:04.623 --> 26:05.224
I'm going to take another one.

26:05.244 --> 26:05.725
I want to take one more.

26:05.745 --> 26:06.205
Yes, but it's not here.

26:06.225 --> 26:06.726
No, it's the other floor.

26:07.027 --> 26:15.959
And the church is on this side.

26:18.022 --> 26:23.971
You say your sister lives here?

26:24.051 --> 26:24.231
Yes.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.693
So where is your apartment?

26:26.247 --> 26:44.272
Put a right on me, sir.

26:45.734 --> 26:46.435
The middle circle.

26:52.604 --> 26:52.744
Thanks.

26:54.766 --> 27:09.400
This line, there was during the last war, the second world war, the Germans were in Rome after the 43th, they occupied Rome and they were going on to buy this one.

27:09.650 --> 27:14.597
Goering was going around, he forced things to stop.

27:14.777 --> 27:21.866
It was forced, but then the Germans took it away, but in fact it was forced.

27:22.046 --> 27:25.050
No, it was forced to go to Jonathan.

27:25.070 --> 27:31.159
After all, the Italian state government said that it was forced.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.281
In fact it was forced.

27:33.301 --> 27:34.543
Goering wanted to buy this.

27:35.148 --> 27:37.692
No, he didn't call him.

27:37.792 --> 27:45.523
My grandfather didn't want to sell him, so he told him a very high price.

27:46.905 --> 27:49.028
I'm surprised what, of course, Italy was here.

27:49.568 --> 27:52.352
I'm amazed he didn't just steal it.

27:53.093 --> 27:55.096
No, no, no, they didn't steal it at all.

27:55.116 --> 28:00.784
Even in the countryside, we had... No, they were quite...

28:01.237 --> 28:29.978
in the country side when they went back to the north in the 44 or 45 it must have been just the color it must have been so white but it was new it must have been just uh and it's beautiful now a lovely

28:31.156 --> 28:39.144
It is how these steps have worn through the centuries, you know.

28:39.164 --> 28:45.812
Millions and millions of steps have been locked down, these people were feasible.

28:45.832 --> 28:49.816
Somebody said it was a lovely man.

28:49.836 --> 28:50.757
Well, I think it is not true.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.138
It is true.

28:52.158 --> 28:53.840
It is true.

28:53.860 --> 28:54.080
It is true.

28:54.100 --> 28:54.321
It is true.

28:54.341 --> 28:54.561
It is true.

28:54.581 --> 28:54.801
It is true.

29:06.627 --> 29:10.836
Full of Roman things.

29:11.057 --> 29:15.967
You can go full of Roman things, because Rome was under a mess.

29:15.987 --> 29:24.165
So here there is a... Gazzanahona was the Stadion of Domuziano, the emperor of Domuziano.

29:24.906 --> 29:26.610
And there was...

29:27.890 --> 29:38.786
Here were columns and... And here you can, you have these tunnels, you go everywhere in Rome.

29:38.806 --> 29:41.009
Yeah, this must be quite an archaeological site.

29:41.029 --> 29:47.899
Do you have, like, rooms underneath so you can... Underneath?

29:47.919 --> 29:51.484
Yeah, so you can... Okay.

29:52.207 --> 30:08.525
You can go up to Rome underneath.

30:08.565 --> 30:09.506
What are these here?

30:09.746 --> 30:11.328
What is all this?

30:11.628 --> 30:15.792
From ancient Rome?

30:15.812 --> 30:15.953
Yes.

30:15.973 --> 30:20.998
Some of them are in Greek.

30:21.873 --> 30:49.222
Look at this door.

30:49.242 --> 30:49.602
Look at this door.

30:51.877 --> 31:15.305
How old is that door?

31:15.325 --> 31:15.785
Right on the nose, huh?

31:15.805 --> 31:15.865
No.

31:15.885 --> 31:16.406
He's got a tundra mat now.

31:16.426 --> 31:16.846
That tundra is great.

31:16.866 --> 31:17.107
You want me?

31:17.127 --> 31:17.327
Thank you.

31:18.590 --> 31:28.585
Wait a minute, don't shoot it yet.

31:28.665 --> 31:31.750
Don't shoot it.

31:32.210 --> 31:37.538
You want it?

31:37.879 --> 31:37.999
No.

31:38.019 --> 31:46.572
Seriously?

31:48.475 --> 31:58.968
So that's a burial thing for the moment?

31:59.428 --> 31:59.949
Yes.

32:00.950 --> 32:12.224
It's dedicated to Happy Week.

32:12.244 --> 32:12.604
Fascinating, huh?

32:12.624 --> 32:13.285
I love that.

32:13.670 --> 32:16.214
What do you call that room up there?

32:17.075 --> 32:21.501
That room where you just stand, that's a loggia?

32:22.322 --> 32:23.083
L-O-G-I-A, right?

32:23.564 --> 32:39.846
It's quite amusing, this palace, because it is the first palace, which is not, as you have expected,

32:39.978 --> 32:42.362
It's on land, but it's on a curve.

32:42.382 --> 32:43.464
I say that again?

32:43.604 --> 32:45.727
Convect.

32:46.469 --> 32:47.530
Yes.

32:47.550 --> 32:52.238
And this too is very strange.

32:54.702 --> 32:59.630
This hole from which the sand enters into the area.

32:59.650 --> 33:02.956
Otherwise it would be very dark.

33:02.976 --> 33:03.657
So it was...
