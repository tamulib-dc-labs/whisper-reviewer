WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:04.869
Peter Drumey at Mass Historical, just so we know.

00:05.690 --> 00:06.211
Go ahead.

00:06.231 --> 00:07.272
You know what you're going to say?

00:07.292 --> 00:30.021
Yeah, this is, when you were talking about the, you know, this is a special kind of book that influences on you, but because David McCullough was talking about this, the book, you know, his first book, I thought it'd be interesting to have Henry Adams, the historian's first book.

00:30.524 --> 00:32.066
That's amazing.

00:32.086 --> 00:32.807
Yeah.

00:32.847 --> 00:36.832
Well, I can't say it's his first book, but the first book that meant something that he kept.

00:37.513 --> 00:41.958
And this was a book given to him by his grandmother, Louisa Catherine.

00:42.499 --> 00:43.640
And we know all of this, right?

00:43.801 --> 00:45.403
Oh, it's got a note by her right in it.

00:47.025 --> 00:51.450
So he has signed it as he does.

00:56.797 --> 00:57.578
That's his

00:58.469 --> 01:01.375
And he has this perfectly idiosyncratic handwriting.

01:01.996 --> 01:05.243
This is a little misleading because that book plate is, in fact, his book plate.

01:05.664 --> 01:10.073
It's a book plate that we put in it.

01:10.534 --> 01:17.468
I think somebody's going to be very happy to find it.

01:17.488 --> 01:17.608
Okay.

01:17.977 --> 01:24.144
I think somebody out of this group.

01:24.204 --> 01:27.067
It could be in the group who came up on the bus.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.129
So put these at the front desk.

01:29.689 --> 01:33.293
Tell them to hold them in case somebody calls.

01:33.854 --> 01:40.861
But tell them to leave a note that at the end of the day, give me these back in case somebody calls late after.

01:41.202 --> 01:46.347
But we think of somebody who's in the teacher group.

01:46.799 --> 01:50.343
Yeah, at the special classroom.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.405
We are aware now, tell me for Mike.

01:52.425 --> 01:55.668
We're in our fourth floor stacks, just renovated.

01:56.189 --> 02:01.414
Now, for the first time, this old part of the building, climate control.

02:03.657 --> 02:12.045
And for the first time for this place, be careful behind you there, because there's a lot of red rot on the shelves as you brush up against things.

02:12.105 --> 02:14.528
But we've got, for the first time, we have...

02:14.677 --> 02:17.862
You can't see over there, it looks like water plants here.

02:17.902 --> 02:21.507
That's an inert fire suppression system that's just installed.

02:21.647 --> 02:22.348
It's intergen.

02:22.368 --> 02:23.730
It's something new.

02:24.691 --> 02:27.655
It's replaced haline.

02:27.756 --> 02:31.681
It replaces haline.

02:31.701 --> 02:32.502
It does the same thing.

02:32.522 --> 02:36.448
It suppresses the fire, but without any toxic or carcinogenic effects.

02:36.732 --> 02:38.837
We're just moving things around.

02:38.857 --> 02:45.614
I'm actually moving a bit wider about him from being an off-site store tomorrow, but let's see if we can get... Where do you store off-site?

02:45.634 --> 02:48.361
We use HD, the Harvard Depository.

02:48.381 --> 02:48.923
Oh, that's great.

02:48.943 --> 02:50.286
We're probably...

02:50.502 --> 02:52.885
My guess is... I don't think they'll let anybody in there.

02:52.925 --> 02:55.809
I don't think they'll let anybody new in anymore.

02:55.989 --> 02:58.993
But I suspect we may be the biggest non-Harvard client.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.736
And it's not secret or anything.

03:00.976 --> 03:03.800
The only thing that makes sense... But you're whispering.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.944
Well, because we have such a good deal.

03:06.964 --> 03:08.206
No, it's not right.

03:08.226 --> 03:08.987
We have such a good deal.

03:09.087 --> 03:15.555
I'm concerned that what's going to happen is they're not going to run out of space in the sense that it's modular.

03:15.576 --> 03:16.477
Well, they can just keep building.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.178
They can go up to 20.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.442
Yeah, but what's going to happen is at some point someone's going to say...

03:21.164 --> 03:30.321
Now, you mean to say we're building this other module and we're storing stuff that doesn't belong to... You know, that's where I'm... I mean, everybody pays the same rate, so it's in that sense.

03:30.601 --> 03:45.028
But what I'm afraid of is someone in some sort of rational business decision, because we are renters, we're not stakeholders in any kind of... Well, I've already written my chapter on sleep, so... Yeah, but we have to, because...

03:45.329 --> 03:53.819
Modern papers, modern papers are just physically so large that it gets, I mean this film is only 40,000 square feet.

03:53.839 --> 03:57.083
You can only, that's... Bill Gates' house is bigger.

03:57.103 --> 04:02.750
Well, you know, you can go up so many shelves and we're in landfill, you know, there's a limit to it.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.351
We use compact service wherever we can.

04:04.752 --> 04:12.501
But, yeah, here's what I was telling you about, let's see, oh, this is just getting...

04:14.185 --> 04:15.607
And these are?

04:15.627 --> 04:16.829
Kipling.

04:16.849 --> 04:18.451
And these are Henry Adams' books.

04:18.472 --> 04:20.374
Henry Adams' copy of The Jungle Book.

04:23.038 --> 04:26.384
But, you know, also they're wonderful copies because they're very early.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.590
Does he have a book plate?

04:31.391 --> 04:33.354
Only a few of his books have his own.

04:33.615 --> 04:37.480
Only actually the books he had when he was young have his own book plate.

04:38.722 --> 04:40.585
But there's his signature in 1895.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.508
Hold on, let's get a look.

04:42.528 --> 04:43.129
That's kind of right.

04:44.898 --> 04:46.641
Look at that.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.983
That's what I love about these cameras.

04:48.063 --> 04:50.066
Well, that's what I love about it, too.

04:50.146 --> 04:50.627
I see it.

04:50.747 --> 04:56.356
It's an 1894 edition, New York edition, which must be early on.

04:56.456 --> 04:58.520
I hate to show you, but isn't this fantastic?

04:58.540 --> 04:58.900
Look at that.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.481
Wonderful.

04:59.742 --> 05:01.565
Yeah, it really is.

05:01.625 --> 05:05.150
So this is a book that's not marked, but it's open.

05:05.851 --> 05:11.260
And also, one of the things, Henry Adams, because he traveled so extensively,

05:11.712 --> 05:16.300
He ran into people like Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson in the South Pacific.

05:17.322 --> 05:19.465
He just moved through this sort of world.

05:19.545 --> 05:27.038
I don't know why, but it surprised me to run into this.

05:27.288 --> 05:33.517
Did it show you a side of Adams that you there too far did not know existed?

05:33.537 --> 05:34.479
Is that what it is?

05:34.499 --> 05:36.582
Yeah, because it shows a wider range.

05:36.662 --> 05:42.010
You think he went bald because his brain was so big it was pushing his hair out of his head.

05:42.451 --> 05:50.383
Adams clan were a bunch of really smart people and really well-educated people.

05:50.403 --> 05:52.205
I think it shows a wider range.

05:52.546 --> 05:55.911
I love Kipling myself, personally.

05:56.060 --> 06:00.586
But tippling, you know, is popular culture, popular writing in its own day.

06:00.726 --> 06:03.950
It's not, you know, high culture, high literature.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.673
You always expect more seriousness out of the Adamses.

06:06.694 --> 06:07.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.117
Well, it's something in French, you know.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.079
Or, you know.

06:11.099 --> 06:13.062
That's kind of letting your hair down a little bit, you think?

06:13.082 --> 06:13.462
Yeah, yeah.

06:13.482 --> 06:21.212
And I think it's important to know—I may have to go up on the ladder to get this down for you, but there's another book that—because we're talking about Roosevelt.

06:21.572 --> 06:24.396
Let's see if I can pull this one out.

06:24.663 --> 06:33.835
I meant to mention to David this morning because I found it very interesting, but there was a book published in 1928, and it's called The Best Books of Our Time.

06:33.875 --> 06:37.641
Have you ever heard of that book by Asa Dawn Dickinson, a librarian?

06:38.041 --> 06:38.942
It's totally unheard of.

06:38.982 --> 06:39.603
I bought it.

06:39.743 --> 06:40.464
There's a new book.

06:40.524 --> 06:43.488
Not exactly like that.

06:43.508 --> 06:46.873
This book of books to read by a librarian?

06:47.123 --> 06:48.685
Reader Services Library.

06:48.966 --> 06:51.369
It's a reader or advisor book.

06:51.389 --> 06:53.212
It's got quite a bit of play in the last few months.

06:53.572 --> 06:55.475
You know, these things are, I don't know that book.

06:56.176 --> 07:00.462
What's funny about it is that, you know, they pick the thousand, tough thousand books and you go in there.

07:01.544 --> 07:03.246
You don't know, I mean, who are they?

07:03.266 --> 07:07.272
And then it gives them rankings, how many sponsors they had.

07:07.312 --> 07:10.296
And one of the sponsors was, I thought David would like this,

07:10.580 --> 07:15.606
is the list of books that Theodore Roosevelt took along with him on one of his expeditions to Africa.

07:16.207 --> 07:19.251
But these were books that Roosevelt must have been quite a reader in his day.

07:19.531 --> 07:27.721
I'm giving away my feeling, but I have a feeling that Roosevelt wrote more books than several recent presidents.

07:27.742 --> 07:36.132
I remember John Kenneth Galbraith told me once, because he loved Adlai Stevenson, when we were talking about how he was the egghead, the perception, he said, well, let me tell you, I knew Adlai very well.

07:36.314 --> 07:40.020
And there were a lot of unread books in his library.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.824
He wasn't quite the egghead everyone made him out to be, he said.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.049
I hope I can find this just paging through for you.

07:46.609 --> 08:05.578
But this is, what this is, Henry Adams spent a great deal of his life writing about the era, the early 19th century American history, the era when Jefferson and then Madison were president from 1800 to

08:05.980 --> 08:07.923
1820, that sort of period.

08:08.304 --> 08:13.351
But in his library, this is Theodore Roosevelt's first substantial book.

08:13.391 --> 08:19.641
This is The Naval War of 1812 that he wrote when he was, I think he started this book when he was a college student.

08:20.102 --> 08:24.889
And this book came out, we actually have an earlier book, a third list for the Adirondacks.

08:24.909 --> 08:29.356
But this is Henry Adams' copy of this Roosevelt book.

08:29.376 --> 08:34.384
And what's sort of interesting to me is, if I can find these marks, they're kind of wonderful.

08:34.702 --> 08:45.938
because they'll have things like, oh, you know, he misspelled Captain Lumley's name, left the knee out.

08:46.018 --> 08:46.679
He's editing it.

08:46.699 --> 08:48.602
Yeah, yeah, these marks.

08:48.642 --> 08:49.643
He's lying editing it.

08:49.663 --> 08:56.133
Yeah, yeah, and he says on the 28th of April, and was it on the 27th?

08:56.674 --> 08:57.375
Was it on the 29th?

08:57.535 --> 08:59.798
I don't think.

09:00.217 --> 09:07.871
Adams had much use for Roosevelt, and he's reading this so closely that it shows him kind of in this worst pedantic way.

09:07.972 --> 09:09.197
There's a place where it says,

09:09.498 --> 09:14.584
the 36-gunship, and then he breaks the margin, the 34-gunship.

09:14.604 --> 09:14.905
Wow.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.486
So he's nitpicking.

09:17.287 --> 09:17.808
He's nitpicking.

09:17.888 --> 09:24.937
To strengthen his own... Yeah, because someone's come into his, what he considers his sphere.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.940
Treading on those turfs.

09:27.960 --> 09:38.593
That's right, and Adam's wrote very wonderfully about the War of 1812, not this kind of, you know, Roosevelt is like, this ship fought this ship, and the Americans are all heroes.

09:38.742 --> 09:47.336
Adams wrote kind of a bigger picture, kind of bigger, the world kind of view, but has a lot of details about individual actions.

09:47.356 --> 09:50.701
Who remembers that Teddy Roosevelt was such a writer, though?

09:50.902 --> 09:56.531
I find it really interesting because he's a kind of vibrant, vigorous writer.

09:56.551 --> 09:59.536
Do you think he was kind of the American Winston Churchill in a way?

10:00.077 --> 10:01.339
Well, that's an interesting point.

10:01.419 --> 10:04.564
I don't see any evidence that

10:04.915 --> 10:07.418
Well, Churchill lived on, what, it's in 1960.

10:07.438 --> 10:09.199
But you want to know Bill Price for literature.

10:09.239 --> 10:10.381
For literature, yeah.

10:10.441 --> 10:19.109
But I don't see any evidence that a hundred years out, you know, okay, Roosevelt dies in 19, you know, dies only four years before Churchill.

10:19.770 --> 10:27.678
So if we know Churchill as being this important, influential writer, do you think people 40 years from now are going to have, I just don't see it.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.501
I don't either.

10:31.730 --> 10:38.917
Churchill wrote more autobiographically about his... They also wrote because he needed the money.

10:38.937 --> 10:39.557
Well, true.

10:41.319 --> 10:46.784
And there are Roosevelt books where he's the central figure, but those are about exploration.

10:47.244 --> 10:51.929
But Churchill writes centrally about his own role and ethical events.

10:51.949 --> 10:58.034
Actually, what I've always been struck by is, you know, it's remarkable about Roosevelt.

10:58.394 --> 11:01.197
It's Roosevelt this really important president

11:02.628 --> 11:06.975
not Rushmore, without being president when there's a war.

11:07.275 --> 11:22.579
And an interesting way is that I've often thought we associate greatness in presidents often with people who are faced and did well and are faced in Lincoln, Franklin Delano, Roosevelt.

11:23.140 --> 11:29.310
You wonder if the United States had kind of come out of the recession in a kind of easy...

11:29.577 --> 11:37.024
more straightforward way in the 1930s, and there hadn't been anything, you know, would FDR loom so large except for this adversity faced?

11:37.444 --> 11:57.102
You know, Lincoln, you know, if Lincoln, well, kind of hard, it's almost impossible thinking without the Civil War, you know, but it's sort of like we kind of have associated this greatness with these events that took place rather than, and these were active agents in those things, but somebody like Roosevelt's interesting.

11:57.142 --> 11:59.044
It's not that he didn't do a lot as president.

11:59.429 --> 12:04.714
But in a way, it's even more remarkable, because most of the stuff he did, he did as an independent agent.

12:04.854 --> 12:11.361
He was forced to do these things, the Panama Canal, the breaking the trust, the national park system.

12:11.601 --> 12:13.883
Nobody made him do any of those things.

12:13.903 --> 12:16.185
I mean, he saw the need for those things.

12:16.285 --> 12:18.948
He's also kind of... Well, maybe that's the essence of his greatness.

12:18.968 --> 12:19.328
Greatness.

12:19.368 --> 12:19.789
Well, it is.

12:19.909 --> 12:22.291
But it's sort of striking that people appreciate it.

12:22.531 --> 12:29.318
But it is sort of funny that people, even people who know about him, will sort of put

12:29.602 --> 12:42.040
That aside, I've always sort of regretted, I've always assumed that, I don't know this for a fact, maybe David McCullough thought his book about young Roosevelt was self-contained, and that was all the story he was going to tell.

12:42.060 --> 12:46.347
I've kind of got this feeling that maybe this Morris biography came along.

12:46.367 --> 12:53.057
Well, I did an interview with him, and he absolutely, his publisher at that time did not want him to do the book.

12:53.257 --> 12:59.406
Yeah, because I find the Morris... And he said, I have enough confidence in what I'm doing that it's going to be sufficiently different.

12:59.791 --> 13:00.712
to justify it.

13:00.732 --> 13:03.676
He was grateful that Simon Schuster said, all right, we'll go ahead and do it.

13:04.116 --> 13:08.561
But I think he really did have to kind of focus on the other.

13:08.782 --> 13:13.287
Yeah, because that's how there are people you know, and it's hard to suspend.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.190
Morris has kind of done the opposite.

13:16.651 --> 13:18.213
He's not done anything bad to me.

13:19.334 --> 13:21.036
I think I've seen him.

13:21.136 --> 13:23.860
I've never had any kind of serious connection.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.743
I find it kind of striking that we have

13:26.993 --> 13:34.904
this enormous correspondence between Roosevelt and Henry Cavett Lodge, as far as I know, Morrison never came here.

13:35.605 --> 13:56.595
You know, for writing substantial books, there are so many, you know, in terms of his biography, there's so much in it that's not kind of, you know, it's almost like his subject is so interesting, and he's a good writer, I'm not saying he isn't, but his subject is so intrinsically interesting, it carries the book forward, and when you look at the book, you think,

13:56.862 --> 14:01.627
How can someone have written 800 pages, and here's all these things that aren't there?

14:02.988 --> 14:08.294
And also, I think I'm kind of a bias against that kind of analogy.

14:08.394 --> 14:10.396
I remember, in fact, I think it was David McCuller.

14:10.436 --> 14:12.298
Again, why Roosevelt?

14:12.318 --> 14:23.629
I mean, I think he was saying at the time that Roosevelt, reading his memoirs, there was so much he didn't say about, I think it was the Panama Canal or something like that.

14:23.828 --> 14:25.812
Maybe that was when he was doing the Panama Canal.

14:25.892 --> 14:27.516
Yeah, that's right.

14:27.536 --> 14:30.161
And that really got him to look at the Panama Canal.

14:30.622 --> 14:36.274
Yeah, there are big things that you'd hard to know from his own description of his own acting.

14:36.294 --> 14:36.575
So what?

14:36.595 --> 14:39.140
But he wouldn't give De Lesseps any credit, for instance.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.425
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.968
Kind of funny.

14:43.235 --> 14:48.260
But, yeah, it's sort of like, but here, this is only part of it because it continues in the back.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.561
Now, these are all Henry Adams?

14:49.581 --> 14:50.522
All Henry Adams books.

14:50.742 --> 14:59.531
I mean, they don't include the large books, which are stored separately, and we're only seeing about, we're seeing about, on this side, about two-thirds of the books we have.

14:59.591 --> 15:01.833
Two hundred volumes, approximately, do you think, roughly?

15:01.873 --> 15:04.155
Thirty-five hundred here.

15:04.455 --> 15:04.596
Uh-huh.

15:04.956 --> 15:10.221
And then what does that, what is that universe of books that he had that, and that's,

15:11.213 --> 15:17.058
He had fixed bases, both in France and Paris and Washington.

15:17.338 --> 15:24.565
Nevertheless, if you move around, you don't collect a lot of books.

15:24.765 --> 15:30.810
I think he read not all of them, but one of the things here... Did you see evidence of what?

15:30.850 --> 15:32.352
There's evidence of a lot of them.

15:33.012 --> 15:38.197
Occasionally there are books that he probably didn't read, but they're kind of wonderful.

15:38.317 --> 15:39.398
I'm looking for

15:39.715 --> 15:42.899
I'll just get it off the shelf, because it'll be right here.

15:46.865 --> 15:49.849
You've been through pretty much all of them, I gather, too, huh?

15:49.869 --> 15:50.309
Yeah, yeah.

15:50.389 --> 15:59.402
Well, one of the things is, you know, be a librarian, work in a room surrounded by books, and you can't not look at them.

15:59.522 --> 16:00.823
Here, this is my favorite thing.

16:00.843 --> 16:02.466
These are your favorites.

16:02.606 --> 16:04.088
One of my favorites.

16:04.108 --> 16:09.435
And it's a favorite in terms of ... Sure.

16:09.618 --> 16:24.377
This is Samuel Ariat Morrison's first important book, written under this roof, probably in the second floor.

16:24.798 --> 16:28.363
And this is the perfect, the world spins on.

16:29.104 --> 16:33.870
Morrison owned, he and his aunt together owned the Otis papers that are here.

16:34.103 --> 16:35.544
that this book was based on.

16:35.965 --> 16:42.772
It's a life in letters, it's very 19th century, you know, all filled with transcribed documents in the way of the 19th century.

16:43.132 --> 16:49.438
But this, and I don't have the letter here, it's not inserted, but I have it.

16:49.598 --> 16:51.200
This book comes out in 1913.

16:51.800 --> 16:57.926
Morrison, still a young guy, has a post at Oxford that year or the year before.

16:57.986 --> 17:01.630
He brings this

17:02.285 --> 17:16.147
this set of books to Paris where Henry Adams is living and writes a note in that polite way of the 19th century, even though this is the 1913 or 14th century.

17:18.651 --> 17:26.824
Dear Mr. Anderson, may I come as humble, come and present you a copy of my humble book because I so admire you as a historian.

17:27.175 --> 17:30.983
And Adams very nicely says, you know, sense of a note thing.

17:31.665 --> 17:36.195
And Adams, after his death, people assembled his correspondence.

17:36.215 --> 17:44.513
So it's one of his wonderful things where you have book letters written to him, but you have his letters are in his papers, which kind of seems a contradiction, but nevertheless.

17:45.274 --> 17:46.517
So you have this kind of

17:46.683 --> 17:54.453
nice, polite exchange of letters, and it's kind of these generations of American historians joined.

17:55.054 --> 18:02.303
You know, here are the young Samuel N. Morrison meeting the, by that time, relatively ancient Henry Adams, and this book.

18:02.784 --> 18:09.733
And I think Adams gives him a copy of one of his books, and, you know, in return is it yet, books being exchanged.

18:09.753 --> 18:11.155
You don't know what the book is, anyway.

18:11.355 --> 18:13.598
I can look it up.

18:14.099 --> 18:15.240
It's an early book.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.622
It may be that

18:16.923 --> 18:23.700
But Adams himself, as a young guy, wrote about this period of American history, about New England federalists.

18:24.702 --> 18:25.604
So there would be a linkage.

18:25.664 --> 18:26.326
There's a linkage.

18:26.486 --> 18:29.133
I mean, it's a very concrete, real linkage.

18:29.173 --> 18:32.080
And I think the gift and exchange, it demonstrates that.

18:32.330 --> 18:35.615
I interrupted your thought about this exchange of books.

18:35.635 --> 18:50.575
But books being, you know, the book is artifacts again, you know, the book is, I can't tell you that all these books are open, which is kind of interesting, you know, that in my test again, again, the great period is the period of the books with unopened pages.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.184
because it gives you a much better feel.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.067
Did they inscribe them together?

18:55.087 --> 18:58.253
I don't believe so, because I think there was this note that came along with it.

18:58.273 --> 18:58.994
Oh, there's a note.

18:59.014 --> 19:02.620
So I think that's an interesting thing, but I think that's a different sensibility.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.967
And often, in other instances, their notes are inserted right in the books.

19:06.987 --> 19:08.690
This one, because we have this big collection.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.533
So that kind of works as the inscription.

19:10.553 --> 19:11.034
Yeah, that's right.

19:11.134 --> 19:14.520
The presentation copy.

19:14.804 --> 19:18.028
put the same kind of weight that we do at having this in the book.

19:18.068 --> 19:22.434
No, the inscription was, I think, from Reddit, the note that came along with it.

19:22.815 --> 19:30.545
But it's that symbolic connection where Henry Adams had long since put American history behind him, and he was an old guy.

19:30.725 --> 19:42.280
Nevertheless, it's this sort of connection of these, arguably one of the great American historians of the twentieth century connects with one of the great historians.

19:42.412 --> 19:46.843
that I used this instance, this episode, do you think we'd be able to find the letters?

19:46.863 --> 19:47.284
Oh, of course.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.912
I mean, quickly, I will for you, no matter whether you used it or not.

19:50.932 --> 19:51.574
Well, I used it.

19:51.594 --> 19:52.937
Because it's such a good story.

19:52.957 --> 19:53.619
It's a fabulous story, yeah.

19:53.779 --> 19:57.568
And Henry Adams letters, because he has this wonderful, long, graceful handwriting,

19:57.548 --> 19:59.470
are very readable in their own way.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.392
And it may well be.

20:00.632 --> 20:08.822
We may even want to reproduce them as... Yeah, but I'll follow up on the kind of details.

20:08.902 --> 20:12.407
And if we had it in both directions, that would be exquisite.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.188
Yeah, we do.

20:13.508 --> 20:20.517
And I think the mention... I don't know what... I think Morrison's own books were dispersed.

20:20.657 --> 20:21.919
I don't think they were kept together.

20:22.186 --> 20:29.254
Peter, you're a formidable reader in your own right.

20:29.774 --> 20:31.616
It's so apparent.

20:32.237 --> 20:34.579
All I do is do interviews now.

20:36.141 --> 20:40.146
You should have heard David McCullough sing his praises this morning.

20:40.166 --> 20:44.150
He usually says, damn, before he says my name, that people think that's my first name.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.192
He said to me, and he said, I'm so glad.

20:46.292 --> 20:48.835
I told him, I said, look, I'm not going to go to the BPL with you.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.077
I'm going to stay here with Peter.

20:50.117 --> 20:51.018
He said, good for you.

20:51.038 --> 20:52.841
He said, you can always go to the BPO.

20:52.861 --> 20:53.783
He said, talk to Peter.

20:54.323 --> 20:55.585
He said, you have to talk to Peter.

20:56.927 --> 21:00.393
He ranks you number one, by the way, of all the curators.

21:00.413 --> 21:01.895
What was that again?

21:02.436 --> 21:04.399
I have it on tape, in fact.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.866
If I could find it, I'll dupe it for you.

21:10.048 --> 21:16.898
It's sort of like, I think, what I really like about this work is that I like the otherworldliness of it.

21:17.182 --> 21:24.099
And the sort of public part of it, I just find it embarrassing.

21:25.061 --> 21:26.585
Well, I'll try not to embarrass it.

21:26.665 --> 21:33.722
No, no, no, but it's sort of like, I'm getting used to it now after my thing yesterday.

21:35.305 --> 21:36.286
I'm getting so forgetful.

21:36.326 --> 21:42.471
So did you study to be a librarian first, or as your background, like David was an English major, I was an English major?

21:42.491 --> 21:43.993
I was going to be a children's librarian.

21:44.013 --> 21:44.733
Is that right?

21:44.753 --> 21:45.234
Yeah.

21:45.734 --> 21:47.296
Well, don't say it like that.

21:47.316 --> 21:49.478
So what was your undergraduate study in?

21:49.498 --> 21:50.298
In history.

21:50.318 --> 21:50.959
And where was that?

21:51.119 --> 21:51.619
At Columbia.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.801
So you have both degrees down there.

21:53.821 --> 21:58.145
Yeah, I didn't go to college until I was much older than people tend to.

21:58.686 --> 22:03.050
Oh, and can you do something for me, M.A.?

22:03.070 --> 22:04.671
This is, I mean, M.A., for M.A.

22:05.225 --> 22:06.747
Delta.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.310
And it's going to, you know, to Thailand.

22:10.411 --> 22:10.551
Uh-huh.

22:10.571 --> 22:14.576
And I probably have already shown you this.

22:14.596 --> 22:22.886
This is this wonderful account of the people in the 1840s going into the Yucatan.

22:23.487 --> 22:23.627
Uh-huh.

22:23.647 --> 22:26.010
And I think it includes right where she's going, too.

22:27.933 --> 22:28.794
Oh, look at that, huh?

22:29.154 --> 22:31.277
So that must be a steel engraving you figure?

22:31.317 --> 22:31.637
Yeah, yeah.

22:31.921 --> 22:39.108
And actually, the story that goes along with it, there are speculations about the Mayan 1840s that are relatively uninformed.

22:39.529 --> 22:54.124
But as I understand it, the state, the physical state of these ruins was that a lot of decay is relatively recent caused by environmental conditions and steel and stuff.

22:54.144 --> 23:00.831
So that what they saw and what they described pictorially is very important for understanding what these things looked like.

23:01.199 --> 23:05.014
And they're modern in a sense of mapping things.

23:05.355 --> 23:09.049
But again, this is that kind of... Whose books are these?

23:09.586 --> 23:12.469
Probably those are Henry Adams' copies.

23:12.489 --> 23:15.232
But they're his copies of what book are we talking about?

23:15.252 --> 23:21.439
It's this man, Joseph Catherwood Stevens, Incidents of Travel in the Yucatan.

23:21.459 --> 23:22.440
Okay, that's famous.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.681
Catherwood and Stevens, yeah.

23:23.701 --> 23:26.785
They made this very famous, let's see if I've got that title right.

23:26.805 --> 23:27.345
That's famous.

23:27.505 --> 23:28.807
Yeah, John L. Stevens.

23:28.827 --> 23:30.789
Well, they're the ones who basically discovered it.

23:30.809 --> 23:31.109
Oh, yeah.

23:31.209 --> 23:33.552
Stevens is the one who says it's like finding a...

23:33.768 --> 23:34.890
on abandoned ships.

23:35.290 --> 23:35.871
Yeah, that's right.

23:35.911 --> 23:41.559
And seeing this... And he was the one who made the comparison to the Egyptian... That's right.

23:41.619 --> 23:41.899
Yeah.

23:42.460 --> 23:46.105
No, I mean, very, very famous, and a wonderful adventure story, you know, too.

23:46.125 --> 23:53.976
And that's very interesting that Adams would have been... Adams was a terrific traveler, but he also collected a terrific amount of travel literature.

23:54.958 --> 23:56.600
I guess I should have known that was in his collection.

23:57.301 --> 24:02.408
I'm sure I showed her this before, and I just gave her a biography of students yesterday, but...

24:02.860 --> 24:04.407
out of my own, personally.

24:04.969 --> 24:12.803
The only thing about being, you know, that's, I can't imagine having a book that I think somebody's interested in not
