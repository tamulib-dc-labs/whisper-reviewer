WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:04.755
Okay, talking to Ron Lane.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.618
Ron, why don't you just tell me what your title is here.

00:06.938 --> 00:09.021
I'm the facility manager for the Harvard Law Story.

00:09.963 --> 00:12.526
And is that, is it Ron, or what's your full name?

00:12.827 --> 00:13.708
Yeah, Ronald.

00:13.728 --> 00:13.948
Ronald.

00:13.968 --> 00:15.630
Do you use a middle initial?

00:15.650 --> 00:17.713
A. Okay, my middle initial as well.

00:18.775 --> 00:23.822
So you said you opened this facility, the Harvard Depository, in 1986, with one module.

00:24.483 --> 00:24.723
Right.

00:25.004 --> 00:29.650
Barbara Graham, who is currently the, uh, um,

00:32.212 --> 00:33.053
What is her title?

00:33.153 --> 00:35.456
Assistant Vice President of... I've got her name.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.098
I'll be interviewing her, by the way.

00:37.118 --> 00:41.644
...of the Harvard University Library for Administrative Services, I believe.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.249
And she was involved from the very beginning.

00:46.811 --> 00:49.655
And they went around and they looked at what existed at the time.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.079
They looked to see what the Library of Commerce was doing.

00:53.460 --> 00:59.147
They looked at the Northern California Regional Library.

01:00.747 --> 01:08.821
I'm not even sure what the title is, but it's a depository in Northern California, which is about twice our size.

01:09.242 --> 01:09.563
Really?

01:12.688 --> 01:14.251
Is that where Berkeley puts their stuff?

01:14.492 --> 01:14.812
I think so.

01:14.832 --> 01:15.513
I've heard of this.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.958
Yeah, actually a truck that goes out and goes back.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.921
I talked to somebody about five years ago.

01:20.402 --> 01:22.165
But this is now the model one, right?

01:22.867 --> 01:24.730
So you went and studied and learned from...

01:25.115 --> 01:25.936
their experience.

01:25.956 --> 01:28.058
I don't mean to say they were mistakes, but their experience.

01:28.138 --> 01:36.268
We went to see what was out there and then came back and took the good parts and invented a whole lot more.

01:37.609 --> 01:45.378
So it opened in 1986 with one module, which is where you're standing in now.

01:45.498 --> 01:46.460
This is the first one?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.542
This part, yeah.

01:48.582 --> 01:54.649
Warehouse is about 8,500 square feet and it's another 2,500

01:54.933 --> 01:55.954
I see.

01:56.595 --> 01:59.618
This is from module one.

01:59.658 --> 01:59.858
Right.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.080
Only 8,500 square feet.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.263
That doesn't impress, that wouldn't impress people.

02:05.283 --> 02:06.624
There's a lot of space.

02:06.664 --> 02:09.547
It's not like a warehouse that might have 30,000 square feet, let's say.

02:09.808 --> 02:10.028
Right.

02:10.568 --> 02:14.512
But as you'll show me, you'll use your space quite effectively, right?

02:14.532 --> 02:15.573
Yes, we do.

02:15.954 --> 02:24.602
Because, well, one of the basic underlying concepts is that we are a storage facility, a library.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.769
So what we do is maximize utilization of space.

02:29.929 --> 02:33.934
And the way we do that is we sort by size.

02:35.375 --> 02:40.140
So if you picture a library shelf, it's half air because they do it with catalogs.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.545
And you have tall books and short books of the same topic.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.848
So if you really picture that library shelf in your mind, it's half air.

02:49.510 --> 02:51.552
What we do is womanate the air.

02:52.493 --> 02:55.578
And we do that very simply by sorting the books for size.

02:56.139 --> 03:01.006
And this was something that was invented here, with the trays.

03:01.026 --> 03:12.543
We took the Princeton model of books, as to what size they generally were, and we broke it down into five different size trays, based on width.

03:12.563 --> 03:13.525
The A's, B's, C's.

03:13.545 --> 03:14.406
Ranging from?

03:14.426 --> 03:16.690
Why don't you just tell me, ranging from what?

03:16.710 --> 03:18.092
I'm not even sure what the size is.

03:18.112 --> 03:20.155
That's about seven inches, and that's about nine.

03:20.692 --> 03:22.774
This is probably a folio size here.

03:23.375 --> 03:27.398
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight different trays, I guess.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.420
No, well, because we do highs and lows.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.363
There are five basic book trays, A's, B's, C's, B's, and E's.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.305
Okay.

03:34.625 --> 03:41.612
And we further break it down into highs and lows just to further reduce wasted space.

03:41.632 --> 03:42.072
Okay.

03:42.092 --> 03:43.233
So you're paying for less air.

03:43.994 --> 03:47.537
If I was a scholar, then, I can't come here and use any books.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.599
You don't want me to even know how to get here, right?

03:49.799 --> 03:50.580
It's true.

03:51.202 --> 04:04.818
What we do very simply in sizing a book is just use a very simple template like this, and we'll just unpack boxes full of books, drag them into the corner, and then see which size tray we're going to put them in.

04:05.259 --> 04:11.546
Because this falls in the yellow here, it's a B. And because it's above that line, it comes a B high.

04:11.827 --> 04:12.427
Okay.

04:12.447 --> 04:16.412
And of course, every one of these is given a bar-coded sticker here.

04:16.713 --> 04:18.795
Each one of these that comes to us,

04:19.366 --> 04:22.750
is barcoded by the customer with a unique barcode.

04:22.890 --> 04:28.817
The customer being, I see this is Widener Library or it could be Cowboy or whatever.

04:28.897 --> 04:29.838
Law school.

04:30.018 --> 04:33.702
Law school or any one of a hundred different Harvard libraries.

04:33.722 --> 04:33.942
Right.

04:33.962 --> 04:35.744
And we treat each customer separately.

04:37.386 --> 04:38.848
We don't mix them when we sort.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.109
We don't mix them in trays.

04:40.169 --> 04:41.251
We don't mix them on shells.

04:43.213 --> 04:45.255
So it does make it easier to retrieve them then.

04:45.944 --> 04:49.630
Well, more importantly, it keeps the customer media together.

04:51.353 --> 04:55.680
They're very nudity about having their books mixed with anyone else's.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.102
That makes sense.

04:58.184 --> 05:01.069
Do you have any, what are considered rare books here?

05:01.690 --> 05:02.130
Probably.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.957
We really don't know because we don't pay any attention.

05:05.977 --> 05:07.699
Well, is Houghton Library one of your customers?

05:07.719 --> 05:07.840
Yes.

05:08.421 --> 05:09.803
So you do.

05:09.823 --> 05:12.788
That's the answer to that.

05:12.948 --> 05:13.048
True.

05:14.243 --> 05:16.987
But what we get is they do the cataloging therein.

05:17.508 --> 05:23.317
They'll call it up in Hollis, and they'll read that barcode into the location field.

05:23.598 --> 05:31.490
We're looking at the bottom of the barcode here, and just as an example, it's HN7NQZ2.

05:31.610 --> 05:33.553
So that would be the code for widener.

05:33.753 --> 05:36.117
Right, that would be...

05:37.177 --> 05:39.661
That would be listed, well, whatever.

05:39.701 --> 05:43.626
This title and all bibliographic data with it would be in Hollis.

05:44.027 --> 05:45.229
Okay.

05:45.249 --> 05:46.110
Which I'm familiar with.

05:46.130 --> 05:47.392
I'm online with Hollis.

05:47.452 --> 06:03.054
So when they send a book out here, when they barcode it, the transfer team at the library puts the barcode on it, calls this up in Hollis, and it puts this barcode in a location field.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.880
So when you call it up in Hollis after they've sent it here,

06:07.619 --> 06:15.010
You'll have all the bibliographic data, and then it will tell you that it's located in Harvard Depository and that this is the barcode number.

06:15.090 --> 06:18.435
Because I do not carry bibliographic data in my system.

06:18.715 --> 06:19.797
I only know that barcode.

06:20.518 --> 06:23.583
I have no clue as to what is associated with it.

06:23.603 --> 06:26.447
Okay, but you know where it is and how you can get it very quickly.

06:26.527 --> 06:27.008
Right.

06:27.028 --> 06:27.268
Right?

06:27.689 --> 06:28.490
That's all that matters.

06:28.570 --> 06:28.911
Right.

06:28.951 --> 06:32.896
I have no need for the bibliographic data, which is a good way to set it up.

06:32.916 --> 06:33.998
I think so.

06:34.940 --> 06:40.788
because it keeps this, as it should be, strictly a storage facility.

06:40.808 --> 06:43.071
And I mean, I could have a Gutenberg Bible here and wouldn't know.

06:43.171 --> 06:46.015
All I know is a barcode, because I know the Gutenberg Bible.

06:46.075 --> 06:47.677
I was sitting in a widener.

06:49.580 --> 06:56.189
So what happens, we sort them for size, and then on the trays, we put our own unique identifier.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.435
This is a unique barcode in and of itself.

07:01.456 --> 07:02.297
So what we have is the

07:02.564 --> 07:08.211
that would be in the physical association of the customer's unique ID to the depository's unique ID.

07:08.932 --> 07:12.756
So, I notice everyone begins with T, which is a trite.

07:12.897 --> 07:13.658
Trite, okay.

07:14.699 --> 07:21.747
And then we have alpha, alpha, bravo, charlie, charlie, delta, D, T, D, T, A, C, C, right.

07:22.128 --> 07:22.408
Okay, good.

07:22.428 --> 07:22.689
All right.

07:22.929 --> 07:30.478
So, when they're finished, filling a trite, it goes on a cart, go right to the pump.

07:31.606 --> 07:35.711
of the number of items in the tray, the right to count on the tray label.

07:36.812 --> 07:50.728
So that when we go in from here, we'll travel with a batch sheet that we haven't filled out yet, which will just have, whatever the book code cart number is, 45, for example.

07:51.249 --> 07:53.592
Then I'll start writing on just the totals from the trays.

07:54.293 --> 07:57.276
So this took 14, 31,

07:58.066 --> 08:01.471
11, 31, 21, 33, 20.

08:02.472 --> 08:12.927
Just out of curiosity, I'm looking at a tray here, 45, and it's got on it three volumes of a book called Polish Review, another one, Research and Postwar Planning, Survey of Agencies.

08:14.629 --> 08:15.711
Why are these books here?

08:15.851 --> 08:16.993
Because nobody's using them?

08:17.994 --> 08:22.340
Why have these books been sent out to the depository from Cambridge or Boston?

08:22.360 --> 08:27.027
Hopefully because they are expected to be a low retrieval item.

08:27.631 --> 08:29.794
A low retrieval item.

08:29.814 --> 08:29.914
Okay.

08:29.934 --> 08:38.626
Which means that, you know, they're a seldom used book at the library, therefore they're eating up space that more active volumes could be using in Cambridge.

08:40.950 --> 08:50.603
Part of our service to the client is to be able to provide them with whatever cutoff figure they use to recall a book and keep it.

08:50.623 --> 08:57.553
For example, we can run a report that says the following items have been retrieved three or more times.

08:58.175 --> 09:02.600
or five or more times if that's what your cutoff is, or two or more times.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.406
During a particular calendar period, maybe within a year or two years or at all.

09:07.786 --> 09:09.128
Yeah.

09:09.148 --> 09:12.812
Yeah, it can be at all or within a specific time frame.

09:13.352 --> 09:20.080
And if there's a greater frequency of demand, then the thing maybe goes, maybe it ought to be going back to Cambridge, is what we're saying.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.502
And does that happen very often?

09:21.702 --> 09:22.102
Yeah.

09:22.122 --> 09:22.443
It does.

09:24.385 --> 09:27.068
They exercise some...

09:31.030 --> 09:36.278
sorting process on their end to say, well, we think these aren't very high retrieval.

09:36.960 --> 09:37.701
So we'll send them here.

09:37.761 --> 09:39.383
But they do monitor.

09:39.403 --> 09:43.630
And if it is more active than it ought to be, they take it back.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.074
Well, the computer monitors it one or the other.

09:46.134 --> 09:50.401
I'm sure that this is not possible without a very sophisticated computer system, is it?

09:51.723 --> 09:52.545
What you're doing here?

09:53.206 --> 09:53.707
Not really.

09:54.007 --> 09:58.354
I have to believe that the computer makes this kind of thing possible.

09:59.178 --> 10:03.743
My next book also is going to look into computers and books.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.907
In fact, do you digitize anything here, or do you just store?

10:07.027 --> 10:08.008
No, we just store.

10:08.209 --> 10:11.753
So if any of this material is going to be digitized, that'll be done someplace else.

10:11.773 --> 10:13.975
It'll be done in Cambridge or wherever.

10:14.136 --> 10:14.957
That's not your job.

10:15.017 --> 10:16.799
It's not your concern.

10:16.819 --> 10:16.919
Nope.

10:16.939 --> 10:20.523
Your concern is to take care of it well and make it available when somebody wants it.

10:20.743 --> 10:20.944
Right.

10:22.145 --> 10:23.206
As quickly as possible.

10:23.406 --> 10:26.690
I think we're still in backup mode.

10:28.432 --> 10:29.033
Meaning what?

10:29.182 --> 10:31.925
Let me show you how the system works.

10:31.945 --> 10:33.567
Oh, okay.

10:33.587 --> 10:36.570
Well, basically what happens is that the trays will come in here.

10:37.151 --> 10:39.834
This disease has only... What room, what do you call this room we're in?

10:40.715 --> 10:41.395
Processing.

10:41.415 --> 10:41.816
Okay.

10:44.759 --> 10:52.968
If you see what we have here, we have individual items associated to depository ID.

10:53.248 --> 10:53.489
Right.

10:55.151 --> 10:58.294
So it's the same whether it's books or whether it's something else.

10:58.966 --> 11:03.651
We have the customer's unique ID to associate with the depository ID.

11:03.671 --> 11:05.353
And I'm just reading randomly.

11:05.993 --> 11:08.396
Low Religious Education Institutes.

11:09.277 --> 11:09.717
Next one.

11:09.757 --> 11:13.441
Spoon River Association of Universalists in Illinois.

11:14.102 --> 11:15.884
Illinois Universalist Convention.

11:15.944 --> 11:19.327
So these are probably periodicals of some sort of journals.

11:19.908 --> 11:20.789
Yes, I have no idea.

11:20.809 --> 11:23.492
The Spoon River Association of Universalists in Illinois.

11:23.512 --> 11:26.695
I mean, I can't imagine that's a high-demand item, but...

11:27.181 --> 11:27.802
You never know.

11:28.344 --> 11:29.125
Somebody might need it.

11:29.225 --> 11:29.987
Somebody will need it.

11:30.368 --> 11:32.152
That must be the mandate here.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.256
At some point, somebody will need it, right?

11:34.276 --> 11:46.202
Actually, this is a semi-active collection because when I got the call from Tim Driscoll that they were going to send it out here,

11:47.768 --> 11:50.490
He said he got all kinds of calls and letters of protest.

11:50.831 --> 11:54.974
Actually, I noticed these are all religion-related items.

11:55.475 --> 11:56.636
This is from the Divinity School.

11:56.656 --> 11:58.378
So this is from the Divinity School.

11:58.398 --> 12:00.880
Does this collection have a name that we're looking at?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.902
Can you determine that from what you see here?

12:02.922 --> 12:05.364
No.

12:05.384 --> 12:05.624
Okay.

12:05.644 --> 12:10.829
But it is from the Andover-Harvard Library, which is the Divinity School.

12:12.510 --> 12:17.775
So what happens with the computer system, very simply, is that we call it up and tell it we're going to do a newer session.

12:18.363 --> 12:23.910
And we put in data to say what media type and code it is.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.955
And then it says, all right, what is the tray number?

12:28.816 --> 12:31.940
And we'll enter the tray number.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.064
And then it'll say, all right, what are you going to associate with that tray?

12:35.925 --> 12:39.409
And then we'll just zap each individual item.

12:41.870 --> 12:48.078
Well, don't mind if I ask questions and jump around the block because I ask them when it occurred to me, but how large is your staff?

12:48.318 --> 12:51.062
How many people would you have to have working here?

12:51.822 --> 13:02.576
I have three careers and ten staff.

13:02.856 --> 13:06.541
So really, so 13 people are handling how many?

13:06.741 --> 13:07.422
Million books?

13:07.874 --> 13:11.537
We brought in this year 500,000 items.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.580
This year being up through the end of May 96.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.602
It'll be through the end of June.

13:16.622 --> 13:17.623
So the fiscal.

13:17.643 --> 13:18.404
Yeah, fiscal year.

13:18.524 --> 13:20.486
So that's a 12-month period.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.532
During the preceding 12-month period, you brought in half a million or so items.

13:27.552 --> 13:27.772
Right.

13:27.852 --> 13:36.160
Not all necessarily books, but... Right, which is a little misleading in that normally we would do about half that.

13:36.663 --> 13:40.447
I have had added staff, too.

13:40.587 --> 13:52.000
I've had two additional beyond that to deal with the volume.

13:52.260 --> 13:55.784
It's because we got a lot of books in it.

13:57.646 --> 14:00.409
We had a lot of stuff from Needle to here.

14:01.351 --> 14:03.234
Right, needle.

14:03.414 --> 14:06.638
Every time I hear needle tape pitch, we're talking about NADL.

14:08.601 --> 14:16.372
Plus their own material, plus the law school, they're renovating Langdell, so I have a tremendous volume of law school material.

14:18.055 --> 14:25.485
For the past year, we did twice the norm in terms of the number of new items coming in, but normally

14:29.448 --> 14:38.741
Normally, I would work with about 12 or 13 people.

14:38.782 --> 14:39.583
Just a rough guess.

14:39.643 --> 14:45.451
How many of these book cards would you say you have?

14:46.573 --> 14:46.653
60.

14:46.873 --> 14:48.976
I'm buying a couple out of this large.

14:49.237 --> 14:52.021
Gaylord has a nice one for 200 bucks.

14:52.221 --> 14:54.184
My house is filled with books, too.

14:54.544 --> 14:57.008
I'm learning things from you as we go along, too.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.769
600 bucks a whack, huh?

14:58.789 --> 14:59.710
You don't get a discount?

15:00.711 --> 15:01.111
Jesus.

15:01.212 --> 15:06.716
No, but the thing is, these stand up much better than six wheels.

15:06.817 --> 15:09.379
These are extremely good carts.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.121
These were bought over a period of time.

15:12.141 --> 15:15.444
Some of these carts are five years old.

15:16.946 --> 15:19.808
Some of them are four.

15:19.868 --> 15:20.729
Some of them are three.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.391
And you can't tell the old ones from the new ones.

15:23.692 --> 15:27.315
And we're beating them every day in terms of weight.

15:27.667 --> 15:38.702
which if I had the $200 car, I'd be... Yeah, well, the Gaylord ones, and they're professional, it's part of the Gaylord, they say they'd warrant them for 15 years, but certainly not for this time.

15:40.003 --> 15:45.130
So we're, I gather now, about to enter what, would you say?

15:45.771 --> 15:49.276
Well, actually, let me show you the, this is the loading dock.

15:49.476 --> 15:50.417
Okay.

15:53.030 --> 16:04.344
Initially, with this module 1, all I had was this for a loading dock, and it was way too small.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.128
And we've added this on because I really needed the space.

16:08.289 --> 16:16.900
So I have a truck dock, and I have a van dock, and this becomes kind of a courier area out here.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.543
So you have a lot of input, don't you, in terms of

16:19.878 --> 16:21.239
Look at this.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.482
This is very impressive.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.223
Now, these are my stacks.

16:25.243 --> 16:25.464
All right.

16:25.824 --> 16:26.705
30 feet high.

16:27.125 --> 16:27.265
Uh-huh.

16:29.367 --> 16:37.375
As I said, the shelves are 36 inches deep by 53 inches wide, and they vary in height, depending on, you know, what I need.

16:39.898 --> 16:40.038
Uh-huh.

16:40.058 --> 16:48.686
The same systems, while closing the gap out here, when we finish the computer processing, what we have is an item associated with a tray.

16:49.027 --> 16:49.227
Uh-huh.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.764
And from out here, each of the shelves has a barcode.

16:53.406 --> 16:56.130
And what we do with handheld readers is we do the same kind of thing.

16:56.150 --> 16:59.155
We open the shelf, and it says, what are you going to put on this shelf?

16:59.415 --> 17:00.938
And then we hit the tray labels.

17:03.081 --> 17:05.164
And each of these trays is 18 inches long.

17:05.305 --> 17:07.007
Now, these look like microphones here.

17:07.187 --> 17:07.408
Right.

17:10.272 --> 17:10.793
How many?

17:11.701 --> 17:13.763
How many going up?

17:14.084 --> 17:16.546
What's the vertical number going up approximately?

17:16.566 --> 17:19.549
Well, it will vary depending on the size of the shelves, but roughly 30.

17:19.690 --> 17:20.470
Roughly 30.

17:21.391 --> 17:25.296
So this module that we're in, I think you said is 8,500 square feet.

17:25.996 --> 17:27.418
But how high is the building again?

17:27.438 --> 17:28.479
30 feet.

17:28.599 --> 17:29.620
Okay.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.462
So effective use.

17:31.522 --> 17:35.387
Has anyone figured out what the square footage is effectively?

17:35.487 --> 17:36.808
I mean, in a realistic manner?

17:37.189 --> 17:40.392
Well, the cubic footage that I use, we don't deal with cubic feet.

17:41.080 --> 17:47.087
What we deal with is book storage feet, which is 12 by 12 by 9.

17:48.068 --> 17:54.475
So that they have some concept of how to be able to translate what they're going to take off the fiber shells and put out here.

17:54.495 --> 17:56.717
So we use BSF as a measurement.

17:57.378 --> 17:59.801
And in each one of the modules, we'll get 150,000 BSF.

18:00.001 --> 18:05.687
I forget how many lineal feet that is, but it's roughly

18:06.038 --> 18:16.809
We've got roughly about 9,000 shells in each module, 36 inches wide, deep by 53 inches wide, so that can be converted if you're mathematically inclined.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.072
Now, a call comes in to get an item.

18:20.053 --> 18:20.273
Right.

18:20.333 --> 18:24.958
Does somebody go right out to get it, or is there a time each day where they try and go and get all of them at one time?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.560
I'm just wondering logistically how it works.

18:26.580 --> 18:34.148
We currently work that circulation generally heats up starting at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

18:34.168 --> 18:34.628
Okay.

18:35.063 --> 18:36.805
We may get calls during the day.

18:36.825 --> 18:40.790
If it's a few items, we'll just wait.

18:42.072 --> 18:50.243
And what happens at 3 o'clock, basically, is we shift our focus from bringing in new stuff to going into circulation.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.726
Do you mind if I come back at some point to see this in action?

18:53.046 --> 18:53.887
No, that'd be fine.

18:53.907 --> 18:55.529
I'd like to just see it at some point.

18:55.569 --> 19:02.218
What happens is, for example, if Widener calls up and on their list they want Howard Widener

19:04.561 --> 19:07.724
FTX9, I think it's what does so, throw my glasses.

19:08.685 --> 19:17.512
Then the system is going to tell me it's an aisle two on the left, ladder two, shelf six, TA10357 in the front.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.834
Are they going to give you a title or just a barcode number?

19:19.874 --> 19:20.915
Just a barcode number.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.057
So in other words, let's just go back and pull this out.

19:23.137 --> 19:31.424
So the fact that this may be WERDER, that seems to be a German text, that's quite irrelevant to you, right?

19:31.605 --> 19:31.805
Right.

19:31.885 --> 19:32.365
I don't care.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.446
That means nothing to you.

19:33.466 --> 19:34.467
I can't read German anyway.

19:34.615 --> 19:38.702
It's Harvard College Library from the Library of Konrad von Mavre, M.A.B.

19:38.802 --> 19:43.170
area of Munich, the gift of Archibald Carey Coolidge.

19:43.190 --> 19:44.613
It's an 1827 book.

19:44.653 --> 19:51.465
This is a fairly rare book, my friend, and it's a German title, which I can't read, and it seems to be signed.

19:52.247 --> 19:54.871
We just kind of pulled this out at random, didn't we?

19:54.891 --> 19:59.239
These are books here that are 170-odd years old, and the...

20:01.312 --> 20:03.034
The title is irrelevant to you, isn't it?

20:03.154 --> 20:03.615
Yep.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.516
I don't care.

20:04.616 --> 20:04.776
Okay.

20:05.157 --> 20:07.740
Good.

20:08.541 --> 20:15.710
You know, when we come out and put these things on the shelves and then, you know, drop that information back into the system, then I have everything I need to find it.

20:15.730 --> 20:16.370
Yeah.

20:16.390 --> 20:20.615
I'm sure that the likelihood of things being up there is just as great as something being down here.

20:20.656 --> 20:21.096
Is that right?

20:21.637 --> 20:21.717
Yep.

20:21.737 --> 20:22.378
Totally random.

20:22.398 --> 20:23.599
So how's he going to go up there?

20:24.280 --> 20:24.781
Ah.

20:24.801 --> 20:29.606
That's why I want to come back one afternoon and see you doing this stuff.

20:29.626 --> 20:30.087
It is easy.

20:31.552 --> 20:34.897
Now, these are forklifts that have a platform on it.

20:36.058 --> 20:39.223
And it becomes a Raymond man-aboard lift.

20:39.884 --> 20:40.805
Say again, what do you call it?

20:41.005 --> 20:42.828
It's made by Raymond.

20:43.028 --> 20:46.913
Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, is the manufacturer and is a man-aboard lift.

20:49.817 --> 20:54.964
So this can actually bring a, it can send up an individual or a whole pallet of things.

20:54.984 --> 20:57.728
Do things go in as pallets or do they go in as boxes?

20:58.529 --> 20:59.831
Well, no, we don't.

20:59.851 --> 21:00.512
Trades, rather.

21:00.532 --> 21:01.153
Trades, I mean.

21:02.163 --> 21:06.929
We put boxes away if it's a large load.

21:08.010 --> 21:10.793
What we do is we process them right on pallets.

21:11.254 --> 21:14.397
We take the platform off and just use the forks and take the pallet off.

21:14.417 --> 21:15.138
I see.

21:16.520 --> 21:25.330
So the retrieval business basically takes place during a set period of time, as a general rule, unless there's an urgent need for something.

21:25.610 --> 21:31.377
And you guarantee delivery, what, in the next cycle, tomorrow, or that'll go in tonight?

21:31.795 --> 21:39.103
If we receive the request by 3.30 in the afternoon, then you'll have it tomorrow morning before noon.

21:41.165 --> 21:42.707
After that, it would be the next business day.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.088
Where does it go?

21:44.108 --> 21:46.010
To the requesting customer, so to speak?

21:46.270 --> 21:48.993
It goes to the requesting library circulation desk.

21:49.354 --> 21:51.616
Okay, so if it's Widener, it goes to Widener.

21:51.636 --> 21:55.961
If it's Andover or Harvard or whatever, it'll go out there.

21:56.581 --> 21:58.323
How many vans do you have running?

21:58.884 --> 21:59.304
Two.

21:59.344 --> 22:00.165
Two.

22:00.702 --> 22:05.869
One is primarily a circulation van, the other one's primarily on a session van picking up new stuff.

22:06.209 --> 22:06.510
Okay.

22:07.251 --> 22:10.014
And what would you say the normal handle is each day?

22:10.174 --> 22:12.237
Do you get many requests each day?

22:12.257 --> 22:12.437
Oh, yeah.

22:12.598 --> 22:25.174
We process, let's see, probably I'll do around 55,000 retrievals this year,

22:25.812 --> 22:26.233
Wow.

22:26.573 --> 22:30.098
Let's divide that by 250, 160-something a day.

22:30.438 --> 22:30.618
Really?

22:32.241 --> 22:32.881
That's pretty good.

22:34.143 --> 22:35.665
My math's not that good.

22:35.765 --> 22:39.250
No, 55,000 a year will be a little better than 1,000 a week, right?

22:40.131 --> 22:41.052
Yeah.

22:41.072 --> 22:42.234
So figure that out.

22:42.254 --> 22:43.936
I think the math is pretty good, actually.

22:43.956 --> 22:51.226
These are record center cartons.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.748
You know, your standard...

22:53.892 --> 22:57.096
Yeah, and this is the Schlesinger Library of Radcliffe College.

23:01.921 --> 23:03.983
And this is, again, module one.

23:04.524 --> 23:04.724
Right.

23:05.085 --> 23:07.007
And there are three others.

23:07.728 --> 23:07.948
Right.

23:08.849 --> 23:09.309
Like this.

23:09.610 --> 23:11.352
Now we're entering another module, right?

23:11.752 --> 23:12.853
Step into module two.

23:12.893 --> 23:19.521
Now this was open in 1991, four years after, or five years after the first one.

23:19.541 --> 23:21.543
Right.

23:21.563 --> 23:23.325
And the only difference here

23:23.947 --> 23:27.992
We changed shelving.

23:28.012 --> 23:29.935
We went through pallet racking uprights.

23:36.523 --> 23:38.426
Look at that side over there.

23:38.446 --> 23:40.709
That's folded post.

23:40.729 --> 23:48.199
And in that kind of a system, the shelving, the actual shelf itself, is part of the rigidity of the system.

23:48.219 --> 23:48.559
I see.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.025
We went to this kind of shelving.

23:54.406 --> 23:56.148
because we could be more flexible with it.

23:56.929 --> 23:58.971
And we could put in these, plot plan drawers.

24:00.092 --> 24:08.821
You can't do this over there because you can't go 60 inches up over there without shelves because then the posts are too flexible.

24:09.422 --> 24:11.864
So the planning that went into this must have been extraordinary.

24:12.085 --> 24:17.270
Oh yes, especially back in the beginning, talking about why it's 53 inches wide.

24:19.152 --> 24:22.135
Now you can see that we have good fit here with D-trace.

24:22.992 --> 24:24.734
They're a good fit here with C-trace.

24:25.495 --> 24:27.277
They're a good fit here with D-trace.

24:28.358 --> 24:30.461
We had the boxes over there that we looked at.

24:30.481 --> 24:33.704
They're a good fit here with E-trace.

24:35.606 --> 24:39.311
And boy, there's very little extra air, isn't there?

24:39.491 --> 24:45.658
Right, and that's why you don't pay for air out here like you do on a library shop.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.603
How about fire protection?

24:48.623 --> 24:51.046
Do you have, I know there's something up there.

24:51.066 --> 24:56.073
We have twice the number of smokes required by code for this kind of building.

24:57.375 --> 25:07.589
And we're online, direct dial to the South Pole Fire Department, plus monitored by ADT, who also makes a call.

25:08.391 --> 25:10.674
The first two modules are not sprinkled.

25:11.855 --> 25:13.738
Modules going forward are sprinkled.

25:14.748 --> 25:20.877
So, you know, water being the greatest enemy of books.

25:20.897 --> 25:21.799
Other than fire.

25:21.859 --> 25:22.720
Other than fire.

25:23.241 --> 25:27.167
So what is the substance you have to put out fires?

25:27.667 --> 25:30.632
Do you have like a powder or something?

25:31.153 --> 25:44.012
No, we would fight it with, you know, initially if we had something, we would use our fire extinguisher on site, but basically it would be water.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.869
which is not so bad.

25:47.730 --> 25:50.293
You know, they can reclaim a water damage book.

25:52.936 --> 26:03.007
But at the time that Unit 1 and 2 were built, there was a conscious decision by the library community not to sprinkle.

26:03.067 --> 26:04.389
And that changed over time.

26:04.409 --> 26:07.612
When we opened Unit 3... And when did Unit 3 open?

26:08.293 --> 26:09.274
Unit 3 opened...

26:10.402 --> 26:13.125
this time last year, 1995.

26:13.406 --> 26:17.931
So basically, you're doing about one every four years, it sounds like, four to five years.

26:19.713 --> 26:22.437
Yeah, four tops.

26:22.457 --> 26:26.321
We've added unit four because we got pushed to it.

26:26.342 --> 26:33.610
As I said, we've done twice the norm this year than it's just normal.

26:35.212 --> 26:39.818
Well, with Langdell closing and Needle coming out here, plus all the stuff that we normally take,

26:40.355 --> 26:44.660
Plus Countway is scheduled to send material.

26:45.581 --> 26:50.587
So we would have run out at an odd time.

26:50.687 --> 26:53.430
So we just continued on and built the next one.

26:53.450 --> 27:00.157
So, but at this rate, you'll probably, well, I guess you've got room to expand for about another 15 years then, probably.

27:00.177 --> 27:01.599
And then you'll figure something else out.

27:02.060 --> 27:04.843
Maybe they'll give you a few more of their hundred and some odd acres.

27:05.984 --> 27:06.885
Yep, never know.

27:07.203 --> 27:11.510
The university has, what, 130, you said, acres?

27:11.530 --> 27:12.271
160 acres.

27:12.311 --> 27:14.395
They had a, you know... And they've given you six.

27:14.595 --> 27:20.445
Yeah, somebody, well, the library purchased from the med school or whatever.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.448
Med school owns it.

27:22.468 --> 27:25.312
Now, this is kind of right, and that's the primate center?

27:25.332 --> 27:28.197
What do they have, monkeys over there?

27:29.239 --> 27:31.122
Yeah, that's primate research down there.

27:32.244 --> 27:34.307
So you have med school personnel over there, right?

27:35.468 --> 27:43.300
I mean, one anticipates that at some point we should be able to add on extra land for more of these modules.

27:44.422 --> 27:45.463
To some degree, yes.

27:46.885 --> 27:48.147
But what's the overall plan?

27:48.308 --> 27:52.574
I mean, is there any limit to how far this thing can go?

27:53.475 --> 27:53.816
Or not?

27:53.936 --> 27:59.164
Well, there's a limit by the property lines, but other than that, no.

27:59.988 --> 28:03.312
I mean, this is as far that way as we can go before we hit problem lines.

28:03.332 --> 28:05.534
You see, a lot of universities wouldn't keep all this stuff.

28:05.554 --> 28:07.636
They'd be accepted to dispose of it, wouldn't they?

28:07.656 --> 28:10.079
So there's a philosophical element here, isn't there?

28:10.099 --> 28:12.762
Right, because Harvard is a collecting library.

28:13.803 --> 28:15.665
Well, set up collecting libraries.

28:16.626 --> 28:21.131
And they are probably always going to be.

28:22.513 --> 28:29.320
You know, it will be interesting in the future to determine, to see if there is some kind of...

28:30.548 --> 28:58.733
collaboration between the various universities who are collecting libraries to say well listen we can't all collect everything and there's no sense in all of us collecting everything and whether or not there will be some well since you already have you know a really good collection going in this area you keep collecting that and I'll stop that would be interesting to see if that comes about and of course you wonder if all of this stuff ultimately will be digitized some of it will be some of it won't I mean it's

28:59.287 --> 29:03.191
It's not an inexpensive process, I'm sure, a time-conservant.

29:03.551 --> 29:10.497
The thing of it is, because we are environmental storage, and explain what that means, environmental storage.

29:11.358 --> 29:17.444
This is all air-conditioned and humidity controlled, and it's done by computer.

29:17.584 --> 29:27.893
Out here in the main storage area, where we have basically paper-based media, we cycle the...

29:29.341 --> 29:32.266
temperature and humidity with the seasons.

29:32.886 --> 29:43.944
In the summertime, I'll be about 60 and 50, temperature and relative humidity.

29:43.984 --> 29:51.656
In the wintertime, I'll be 50 and about 40.

29:52.517 --> 29:57.745
And in this cycle, as we come into summer,

29:58.602 --> 30:03.668
a little bit warmer and higher humidity.

30:03.788 --> 30:23.833
But because we have that, and because we use sodium vapor lamps, and because we have charcoal filters which take anything out of the atmosphere, and because of the way we store and the good air circulation we have, we don't form any microclimates, we'll extend the life

30:24.505 --> 30:25.266
of these books.

30:25.346 --> 30:26.788
Is it going up by a factor of eight?

30:26.808 --> 30:27.789
Do you mind if I take a picture?

30:28.049 --> 30:33.596
No, go ahead.

30:33.796 --> 30:35.278
Because of the environment.

30:35.499 --> 30:38.222
What you get, because we have an environment.

30:38.422 --> 30:46.412
We're not just a storage facility, we're also a preservation facility, because with the controls that we have for paper-based media,

30:47.084 --> 30:50.991
it increases the life of the materials by a factor of eight.

30:51.772 --> 31:00.507
So if a book's going to last 100 years on its own, it's going to last 800 years in this kind of an environment.

31:00.547 --> 31:00.848
Yeah.

31:00.868 --> 31:05.155
So you get more than just a warehouse here.

31:05.175 --> 31:10.324
What you have is a preservation environment for all of the material that's here.

31:11.114 --> 31:12.896
Tell me a little bit about your background.

31:13.136 --> 31:14.898
You came through library work?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.360
Have you been here since the beginning?

31:16.660 --> 31:21.786
No, I came here in 89 after we'd been up for three years.

31:21.966 --> 31:29.134
I worked for Iron Mountain, which is the country's largest record storage company.

31:30.115 --> 31:34.900
We're talking about paper records, not vinyl records or anything like that.

31:34.920 --> 31:39.585
Right, and they were part of building records.

31:40.358 --> 31:54.275
They were part of building Unit 1 because Richard Reese had gotten his MBA, I believe, at Harvard, was part-time faculty and was the president of Iron Mountain.

31:54.295 --> 32:06.990
So Iron Mountain helped with the design originally and had a facility management contract for the first five years of operation.

32:08.152 --> 32:15.680
I was the vice president, the manager rather, of administration for New England.

32:17.562 --> 32:22.768
And when this became available, I decided I'd rather do this.

32:23.769 --> 32:24.970
That's great.

32:24.991 --> 32:28.174
Do you have like a, I mean, a feel for books?

32:28.194 --> 32:31.858
I mean, I write about people who, this is really a job.

32:32.218 --> 32:37.264
I mean, you can mention the customers and this is inventory.

32:37.548 --> 32:43.035
Oh yeah, we're very... But you know, I mean, you have a sense of what it is that you're storing here.

32:43.136 --> 32:57.495
Oh, I think we all do, but on the other hand, I think what some people have difficulty realizing is that the Gutenberg Bible, for example, would be just another book with a barcode on it if it were here.

32:58.076 --> 33:01.520
That's a great quote.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.264
You know, because people are... For example, somebody's

33:04.750 --> 33:07.493
Some of these records we have, I'm sure, are sensitive.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.817
I mean, you've got all kinds of stuff out here from general counsel.

33:10.838 --> 33:14.082
You've got all kinds of stuff out here from law school.

33:15.844 --> 33:19.368
You know, it wouldn't surprise me if I had, you know, O.J.

33:19.388 --> 33:22.932
stuff out here because of Dirtuit.

33:23.053 --> 33:23.713
Sure.

33:23.814 --> 33:26.657
But to us, it's just another block full of paper.

33:26.975 --> 33:35.245
So I have to believe, then, that having brought that up, that you must have some kind of a security system that people really don't get access to this stuff.

33:35.265 --> 33:36.046
Well, that's true.

33:36.166 --> 33:39.009
Part of the security system is that we don't know what it is.

33:40.310 --> 33:43.955
Because we don't have, and yet people aren't... We don't have the catalog size.

33:43.995 --> 33:46.838
And yet people aren't allowed to examine it either.

33:46.878 --> 33:47.579
That's correct.

33:47.779 --> 33:50.282
We're not allowed to look in the boxes.

33:51.764 --> 34:02.874
But it's when you're working in this environment, there's so much stuff flowing in for which we're responsible and treating in a, you know, a good media handling methodology out there and then getting it onto the shelves.

34:04.075 --> 34:05.396
But that's what we do.

34:06.397 --> 34:07.238
We bring stuff in.

34:07.278 --> 34:08.218
We put it on the shelf.

34:08.298 --> 34:09.800
If you ask for it, we get it for you.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.503
And we don't care what it is.

34:13.603 --> 34:14.584
We don't know what it is.

34:14.604 --> 34:15.445
We don't know what it is.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.145
We don't care.

34:17.166 --> 34:21.450
All we need to know is you want this barcode you gave us tomorrow morning.

34:22.190 --> 34:22.971
And that's what you get.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.755
That's great.

34:25.376 --> 34:33.331
So we have kind of a simply elegant system, but some of these other places change.

34:33.431 --> 34:41.987
But you notice we have aisles, we have left and right, and we have ladder numbers.

34:43.182 --> 34:52.254
If you think about a library, you keep walking through, looking at these little cards on the end of the aisles, trying to find out what the category is that's in that aisle.

34:53.095 --> 34:53.896
And we don't have that.

34:54.437 --> 34:55.778
I noticed that there are eight aisles.

34:57.501 --> 35:02.687
This is actually the seventh aisle of Module 2, or the seventh aisle starting.

35:03.028 --> 35:04.209
There's one start over there.

35:04.289 --> 35:06.612
Yeah, seventh aisle starting from one over the Module 1.

35:06.632 --> 35:10.578
Okay, so there are four aisles in each module, giving us, what, eight?

35:11.319 --> 35:12.480
Well, there's eight through here.

35:13.253 --> 35:21.601
You know, here we're up to 12 currently operating.

35:21.621 --> 35:25.605
We're up to 12 currently operating, and then we're adding another four in here.

35:26.806 --> 35:32.632
And I can see now, you know, I said, wow, 8,500 square feet, two and a half million, if it were books.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.074
That's not possible.

35:34.114 --> 35:37.577
But as I look at it now, it's possible.

35:37.597 --> 35:41.421
No matter what, no matter what,

35:41.772 --> 35:44.294
The tight media is, it's always the same.

35:44.315 --> 35:48.298
You see those document boxes.

35:48.318 --> 35:50.220
Nice efficient fit on the shelf for those.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.382
Nice efficient fit for records on the cartons.

35:52.763 --> 35:55.245
Efficient fit for all the different tray sizes we have.

35:55.305 --> 35:56.807
That's why we're at 53 inches.

35:56.887 --> 35:58.308
I'm going to take a couple of shots.

35:58.328 --> 36:00.751
Texas made a mistake going to 48.

36:00.771 --> 36:01.511
They didn't ask us.

36:01.832 --> 36:03.714
Texas made a mistake going to 48.

36:04.354 --> 36:05.235
And they wouldn't be able to do it.

36:05.255 --> 36:07.257
I'm going to just take a couple of shots of what you're saying.

36:07.397 --> 36:10.260
Texas' mistake was

36:11.152 --> 36:12.013
So they didn't come here.

36:12.033 --> 36:14.675
They probably figured they could do it just as well.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.637
Oh yeah, they're all in Texas, you know.

36:17.838 --> 36:18.999
Been there, done that before.

36:20.520 --> 36:24.744
So I guess you've, now when people come from abroad or wherever, this is what you show them.

36:24.985 --> 36:27.787
But what kind of questions do they have, just out of curiosity?

36:29.449 --> 36:34.633
Some good, some bad, and some they don't absorb.

36:34.653 --> 36:40.939
I think part of what they tend not to absorb is that

36:41.240 --> 36:50.254
What we do, the simplicity that we have with aisles and left and right faces and ladders all the same number, they don't get.

36:50.274 --> 36:52.077
They still think the library.

36:54.401 --> 37:05.779
I think it's part of the reason that what we have here is we have a good ... At Harvard we have a good mix is because ... I'm a storage person.

37:07.025 --> 37:11.311
And in the beginning, Iron Mountain was storage people.

37:11.871 --> 37:13.554
And Iron Mountain, again, is where?

37:14.535 --> 37:17.199
Well, they were involved in the initial planning.

37:17.219 --> 37:17.719
I see.

37:17.739 --> 37:19.782
And the initial running of the facility.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.285
Okay, so this is an outfit called Iron Mountain.

37:22.365 --> 37:22.706
Right.

37:22.726 --> 37:23.066
Okay.

37:23.086 --> 37:24.849
It's the country's largest record storage.

37:24.949 --> 37:28.574
Okay, you mentioned that earlier.

37:30.677 --> 37:32.759
This is the media film wall.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.563
It's kept at a 50...

37:35.712 --> 37:36.695
Carson, 1535.

37:36.835 --> 37:40.504
It's like we used to call in the Navy a reefer.

37:40.524 --> 37:43.372
This is for microfilm.

37:43.392 --> 37:48.024
So what we have here is master microfilm and various kinds of things.

37:48.124 --> 37:50.751
And this is a carpenter center film.

37:54.241 --> 37:58.588
This is called a Mark III Romanumeral III Diner Track System.

37:59.429 --> 38:00.711
It's like a refrigerator, isn't it?

38:00.831 --> 38:02.433
It's like a cold storage is what it is.

38:02.874 --> 38:07.641
We've had this done as a turnkey operation by Harris, Harris Environmental Systems.

38:08.502 --> 38:20.460
We told them what we wanted was a box within a box, and it's all controlled by its own air conditioning unit, which is overhead.

38:20.981 --> 38:22.864
Do you have people here all the time?

38:23.907 --> 38:32.537
We're open for a while today, and we're monitored for burglary and fire.

38:33.839 --> 38:34.580
You know what, I'm sorry?

38:34.620 --> 38:35.841
For burglary and fire.

38:36.542 --> 38:43.030
We have perimeter security.

38:45.173 --> 38:46.094
This is really great.

38:46.134 --> 38:50.539
I can't tell you how useful this will be.

38:52.105 --> 39:07.486
I guess what, you know, it's the basic simplicities, the customer unique ID to the unique tray ID, the unique tray ID, the unique shelf ID, and it just allows you to find anything within 18 inches.

39:07.526 --> 39:10.410
Can I get a couple of pictures of these folks working?

39:10.510 --> 39:19.802
I think this is what it's all about.

39:19.822 --> 39:21.184
Thank you.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.417
Normally.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.426
Okay.

39:55.446 --> 39:57.589
Anything else, Ron, that I've missed, do you think?

39:59.531 --> 40:03.556
No, basically, that's, you know, that's kind of it.

40:03.616 --> 40:11.025
The computer system is sophisticated yet simple, if you will.

40:11.906 --> 40:13.488
It's a very well-designed system.

40:14.369 --> 40:15.551
It's still on backup, right?

40:15.671 --> 40:17.373
Haven't sent this online yet?

40:17.794 --> 40:19.015
No, we're back, actually.

40:19.940 --> 40:38.390
But this was designed for us.

40:40.894 --> 40:45.441
I spent a year in concert with OIS writing this fact,

40:45.607 --> 40:47.369
OIS being?

40:47.449 --> 40:53.096
Office of Information Systems at Harvard University Libraries.

40:53.116 --> 41:01.527
They do all kinds of things, but those are the people who are writing in Jim Hollis.

41:03.309 --> 41:11.800
And then we spent a year on the phone with the developer.

41:16.758 --> 41:17.539
That's fast.

41:39.774 --> 41:41.376
So these are PCs actually.

41:41.396 --> 41:44.942
Are these tied into a... Well, actually they're

41:45.344 --> 41:50.912
Right now, they're about to be dumb terminals.

41:57.422 --> 42:07.857
So you call them clients, right?

42:07.877 --> 42:10.822
Do they request to come in by computer, or do they come in, you know?

42:10.842 --> 42:13.005
They're starting to now.

42:21.642 --> 42:42.115
Before, we always got to meet by phone or fax, and now we have something called Fetcher's, which allows you to sit at your terminal and call up Hollis.

42:42.297 --> 42:46.822
If it's out here, you can directly request it through your terminal.

42:46.922 --> 42:50.065
And it queues up, and we get a machine readable file four times a day.

42:50.305 --> 42:53.748
So you have accessions, retrievals, copy retrievals, permanent withdrawals.

42:53.869 --> 42:58.053
Permanent withdrawals means they're going back, I would imagine.

42:58.373 --> 43:03.098
Refiles, deletions, management menu, all sorts of basic stuff.

43:03.118 --> 43:06.761
And there you go.

43:07.042 --> 43:12.287
So you're able to... Now the fellows that go up in those

43:12.554 --> 43:36.098
forklifts there they get a list of things and strictly yeah they'd get a retrieval list in other words why they send us a request for you know 60 items then what we'll wind up with is a pick list for those 60 items which gives us the most efficient way through the stocks to get them i see oh good the computer figures that out for you

43:36.888 --> 43:39.070
That's great.

43:39.110 --> 43:43.956
They just go where the list tells me, you know, file two, left, part of six, you know, shelf 14.

43:43.976 --> 43:45.778
So the computer will figure out a route for you.

43:47.340 --> 43:52.606
So that's why you try and really focus it at a certain time and when you can do them all efficiently.

43:52.926 --> 43:55.609
How long does it take to build one of these buildings, one of these modules?

43:56.390 --> 43:59.834
About nine or ten months.

43:59.974 --> 44:00.274
Really?

44:00.314 --> 44:00.955
It takes that long.

44:02.268 --> 44:05.491
They're a little bit more sophisticated than they might appear, can't they?

44:05.551 --> 44:11.177
Yeah, it's all, you know, it's block building.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.418
It's all insulated.

44:14.940 --> 44:16.842
Yeah, it's quite an undertaking.

44:17.983 --> 44:21.507
Each module is probably two and a half million dollars.

44:25.370 --> 44:25.871
Very good.

44:25.891 --> 44:27.833
But it's a lot cheaper than adding to a library.

44:27.893 --> 44:28.634
Oh, I think so.

44:28.854 --> 44:29.554
I think so.

44:29.575 --> 44:30.175
It's kind of nice.

44:30.215 --> 44:32.157
Now, do you live out this way?

44:32.778 --> 44:38.146
The curve is accelerating for other universities to put these things up.

44:39.188 --> 44:45.317
Not only other universities, Library of Congress is also embarking on one very similar to this.

44:46.259 --> 44:50.886
But you have to have something out that's accessible where, I mean, the land must be.

44:51.246 --> 44:52.768
You couldn't do this in Cambridge, could you?

44:52.788 --> 44:52.969
No.

44:54.271 --> 44:56.494
Well, some universities are doing it on campus.

44:56.514 --> 44:58.397
Minnesota is putting me as underground.

44:58.917 --> 45:00.219
Right under the campus.

45:00.239 --> 45:04.686
They have limestone caverns under the campus, so that's where they're going to put their storage facility.

45:05.287 --> 45:07.030
Very expensive.

45:07.050 --> 45:11.197
Now, you wonder what the temptation might be to just get rid of the books and digitize the stuff.

45:11.717 --> 45:13.620
You know, you don't know anything about that.

45:14.261 --> 45:14.722
It's a debate.

45:14.742 --> 45:16.685
Well, it's philosophical decision-making in our head.

45:16.705 --> 45:21.733
Oh, yeah, no, I understand, but I just came from a conference in Maryland two weeks ago, a library.

45:21.914 --> 45:22.875
Boy, they're talking.

45:22.915 --> 45:24.638
There's a new state.

45:25.529 --> 45:28.473
campus out in California that wasn't even built with a library.

45:28.493 --> 45:30.536
I mean, it's all computers.

45:30.556 --> 45:34.762
The temptation must be, it's cheap, you know, you can get everything you need over a computer.

45:34.802 --> 45:36.765
Why have a book at all?

45:36.785 --> 45:39.428
I'm, of course, opposed to that.

45:39.448 --> 45:41.952
It's a very significant thing for me to see.

45:43.895 --> 45:46.538
Well, there was a lot of faculty resistance in the beginning.

45:46.859 --> 45:47.199
To what?

45:47.980 --> 45:48.901
To the depository.

45:48.962 --> 45:50.043
You know, books going out.

45:50.283 --> 45:52.887
Books flowing in a library where you can browse them kind of thing.

45:53.963 --> 45:57.206
And that if we were going to have this kind of facility, then we had to have a reading room.

45:58.748 --> 45:59.569
So, we have a reading room.

45:59.749 --> 46:00.910
Can you put the lights on in here?

46:01.070 --> 46:02.972
I'd love to get an available light shot.

46:05.095 --> 46:05.815
This is good.

46:05.915 --> 46:07.017
I agree with this, you know.

46:07.037 --> 46:09.559
There is a reading room at the depository.

46:09.579 --> 46:13.944
In fact, how about pulling Ed Harvey here to the head of the table?

46:15.345 --> 46:18.268
This is where it belongs.

46:18.408 --> 46:19.009
Yeah.

46:34.801 --> 46:58.876
There's no reason why they didn't want to anyway.

46:59.497 --> 47:03.222
Yeah, because we're 30 miles away.

47:03.775 --> 47:06.017
and they're not authorized access to the media.

47:06.137 --> 47:19.750
I would have to have special permission from the library circulation, or actually head of department, to allow them access to the media.

47:20.190 --> 47:22.752
So this room was actually kind of put in as a concession.

47:23.213 --> 47:25.034
Yeah.

47:25.074 --> 47:27.677
So has it ever been used as a meeting room?

47:27.937 --> 47:29.739
No.

47:29.779 --> 47:33.462
So it's kind of like a coffee mess, as we used to say in the name.

47:33.661 --> 47:34.982
It's comforting for us.

47:35.002 --> 47:38.286
We go to our construction meetings and we hold employee meetings here.

47:40.788 --> 47:45.533
When group tours come to see how we do it, we sit around and tell them.

47:46.093 --> 47:46.353
Great.

47:47.054 --> 47:47.595
Thanks, Ron.

47:48.456 --> 47:51.438
I didn't sign in by the way.

47:51.459 --> 47:53.480
Did you want me to sign in?

47:53.941 --> 47:55.242
Yes, please.

47:57.384 --> 47:58.706
There are 13 million in the system.

47:58.866 --> 48:02.149
Ron has about a million and a half here of books.

48:02.703 --> 48:05.866
at some point to balance by tipping their direction, won't it?

48:08.289 --> 48:08.790
Probably.

48:08.830 --> 48:12.414
Down, well, down the road a piece.

48:12.594 --> 48:16.038
Yeah, I think that's a point worth making.

48:16.078 --> 48:18.120
Most of the books are not here.

48:18.841 --> 48:20.102
The books they're not using are here.

48:20.763 --> 48:22.024
Right.

48:22.044 --> 48:23.466
Most of the books are still in Cambridge.

48:25.228 --> 48:32.035
Theoretically, I have the very low activity stuff that somebody calls for once every five, ten years.

48:32.318 --> 48:37.263
But the other point of it is that it's immediately available.

48:37.664 --> 48:41.968
I mean, you call today, you get it tomorrow morning.

48:41.988 --> 48:48.756
And if you really had to have it today, if you're somebody important and the library wants to pay me $100 to get it there today, I'll do it.

48:50.057 --> 48:52.860
We do have an emergency retrieval service.

48:52.880 --> 48:59.107
And when you say pay you up, meaning paying you by going into the budget to handle... Right.

48:59.247 --> 49:00.148
We run as a...

49:00.854 --> 49:06.541
Well, as damn near everything else in Harvard does, we're supposed to cover our costs.

49:06.561 --> 49:11.547
And, you know, it's Harvard money from one pocket to another pocket, but we are an expense to the library.

49:15.491 --> 49:21.718
So if somebody is willing to shift $100 from their budget to your budget, you'll get the item ASAP into Cambridge?

49:21.779 --> 49:21.959
Yep.

49:24.261 --> 49:26.224
And I'm sure there are authorizations to do that.

49:26.644 --> 49:28.987
And I'm sure it probably even happens periodically, right?

49:29.428 --> 49:29.848
It does.

49:30.487 --> 49:32.149
And, of course, you never know what the item is.

49:32.249 --> 49:36.794
All you know is, like if I said, give me an example, all you'd be able to give me is a barcode number.

49:37.074 --> 49:37.154
Yep.

49:37.835 --> 49:40.538
I have no clue.

49:40.558 --> 49:50.228
I mean, we will sometimes get emergency retrieval things from general counsel, for example, because they're preparing some case or whatever, and they need something, and they discover it's out here.

49:50.248 --> 49:53.291
And lawyers being lawyers, they want it now.

49:53.331 --> 49:53.771
Yep.

49:54.472 --> 49:57.135
And general counsel just calls up and says, you know,

49:57.571 --> 50:19.748
authorization code xxx give me this box number and you take it to cables good i am going to put some more film in this is a nice picture here actually it's beginning to be a nice looking video yeah it is it is i can't even imagine what it looked like when it was just a one unit anymore four times the size when i came here well

50:20.808 --> 50:26.027
I'm going to just walk around and take a couple of exterior shots if it's okay with you.

50:26.047 --> 50:27.071
And I'll be in touch, Mark.

50:27.172 --> 50:28.135
Thank you.
