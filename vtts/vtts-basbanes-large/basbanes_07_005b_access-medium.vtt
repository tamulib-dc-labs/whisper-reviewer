00:03.001 --> 00:27.557
This is about one-sixth of the children's books, and it's principally English books of the 18th and 19th century.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.709
I really want to get some keys.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.392
You said you wanted to see some things.

00:31.412 --> 00:32.313
Let me just get here.

00:32.654 --> 00:37.862
Look around for a minute.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.285
There are a whole series of these.

00:45.593 --> 00:57.831
This is called the Infant's Cabinet, and these are little, in this case, books.

00:58.368 --> 00:59.450
of instruction.

00:59.550 --> 01:01.212
And this one, I think, is of Byrds.

01:03.315 --> 01:06.399
John Marshall is a publisher in London.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.562
It's a late 18th century.

01:08.623 --> 01:12.548
Isn't that great?

01:12.568 --> 01:16.534
And there are, there's a series of these.

01:16.614 --> 01:22.022
We have some of the only known copies, surviving copies.

01:22.723 --> 01:25.827
Wow, what is this one?

01:26.718 --> 01:30.484
Oh look at this one.

01:30.585 --> 01:36.234
Children use these and they're still intact.

01:38.298 --> 01:43.587
This is the level of quality of this collection.

01:43.627 --> 01:46.532
This is about 1810.

01:47.103 --> 01:50.007
OCLC records one other set in North America.

01:50.027 --> 01:56.174
I wonder if this one has a... You call that an infant's library.

01:56.194 --> 01:57.276
Is that what you call it?

01:57.296 --> 01:57.716
Yeah.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.119
Infant's library.

02:00.239 --> 02:05.886
I think that's what Marshall called it.

02:05.906 --> 02:11.934
It says so right on here on the painted board.

02:13.075 --> 02:15.378
The infant's library?

02:15.879 --> 02:15.979
Yeah.

02:16.786 --> 02:19.790
Oh, this is from Dalte Welch's collection.

02:19.830 --> 02:25.877
Now, you know, he gave his American collection to the American Antiquarian Society.

02:26.477 --> 02:28.640
His English side of it came here.

02:29.201 --> 02:31.904
The English books of Dalte Welch came here.

02:33.726 --> 02:34.407
No, it's ours.

02:34.567 --> 02:37.851
How does he spell the name?

02:37.891 --> 02:43.317
Small d apostrophe, A-L-T-E, Welch, W-E-L-C-H.

02:44.107 --> 02:47.933
There's a bibliography of American children's books by him.

02:48.434 --> 02:52.921
That's the standard bibliography, and the collection is that American Antiquarian Society.

02:52.961 --> 02:54.904
They're children's books in America.

02:54.924 --> 02:55.244
Yeah.

02:56.105 --> 03:06.441
And he and Wilbur Smith were close friends, and when Dolphy died, Ann Welch gave the English books to UCLA, his memory.

03:08.665 --> 03:08.865
Thank you.

03:15.460 --> 03:23.513
There's also the infant cabinet, but I don't see it, which is like little flashcards.

03:23.573 --> 03:25.657
They're similar sort of thing.

03:26.157 --> 03:30.825
Also published by Marshall, but I think you get a sense of that.

03:32.107 --> 03:35.753
One of the other things that we'd like to talk about here is condition.

03:37.576 --> 03:38.437
Right, which I said.

03:38.457 --> 03:38.818
Yeah.

03:41.077 --> 03:43.800
This is from the George Shires Library.

03:43.860 --> 03:47.605
This is another one of our children's books.

03:47.625 --> 03:55.615
And a lot of these 19th century ones are prescriptive sorts of things.

03:56.656 --> 03:59.479
And I think this is a Mariah Edgeworth.

03:59.499 --> 04:00.701
Oh, it's dedicated to her.

04:00.741 --> 04:05.987
We have Mariah Edgeworth's library as well.

04:07.604 --> 04:10.807
The early children's books did tend to be prescriptive like that.

04:10.827 --> 04:18.034
Yeah, in that period.

04:18.794 --> 04:31.146
This room, which was established by one of our former English faculty members for the Sadler collection, it's now, that little quarter of it is now publications as well.

04:31.166 --> 04:37.071
So anyway, but this is the original Sadler collection of about 9,000 volumes.

04:37.540 --> 04:41.126
It's on the shelf in Sadler number order.

04:44.571 --> 04:45.432
I have the catalog.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.195
You have the Sadler catalog.

04:47.215 --> 04:49.058
The one that he did.

04:53.545 --> 04:55.829
Yeah.

04:59.935 --> 05:04.122
I think one of the things that's troublesome to us about this now is that

05:04.422 --> 05:06.505
We acquired the collection around 1950.

05:09.028 --> 05:11.731
We have more than doubled it in size.

05:12.292 --> 05:17.679
And I think Texas, for example, touts the Wolf Collection says, oh, we're much bigger than Sadler.

05:17.759 --> 05:21.484
Well, certainly as far as the published bibliography is concerned.

05:21.504 --> 05:25.609
The original Sadler had about 3,000 titles.

05:26.090 --> 05:29.514
No, about 4,000 titles and about 9,000 volumes.

05:29.574 --> 05:31.797
We have about 20,000 volumes now.

05:32.131 --> 05:37.559
But we kept the original Sadler intact, and the rest of the books are in our rare book stacks.

05:37.619 --> 05:46.832
I want to show you a couple things.

05:46.952 --> 06:00.552
And what's also nice about when we move to the new quarters, they all come out very easily in the room, getting reconstructed.

06:03.080 --> 06:10.731
Just to show you, again, the issue of condition.

06:11.052 --> 06:16.440
This is for double-decker by Robert Brody.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.165
We put the wrappers on it.

06:20.286 --> 06:21.728
This is a chintz binding.

06:21.968 --> 06:22.489
Look at this.

06:22.509 --> 06:25.173
It's like it just came off the press.

06:25.714 --> 06:31.382
Yeah.

06:32.982 --> 06:53.233
And when you think that this was the popular literature of the 19th century, that's one of my favorite findings.

06:53.253 --> 06:56.037
A lot of the books are just in paper wrappers.

07:09.635 --> 07:11.417
Okay.

07:11.437 --> 07:21.890
We had a visitor recently in there.

07:22.451 --> 07:25.335
Does this collection get much use among researchers?

07:25.435 --> 07:26.216
A fair amount.

07:27.377 --> 07:35.667
I don't know if you see any slips on the shelves, but wherever there's a call slip, there's something to use.

07:36.669 --> 07:38.511
We had somebody here from Cambridge

07:38.879 --> 07:45.888
within the past couple of weeks doing some work.

07:45.908 --> 07:50.154
And are there any favorite authors of yours of this period?

07:50.374 --> 07:53.959
I'll go with Warpage.

07:55.221 --> 08:04.233
Remember that, as I started to say, this was the popular literature of the 19th century, you know, the kinds of books we would take to the beach for the summer reading nowadays.

08:04.273 --> 08:08.599
I mean, to find copies in this condition is unbelievable.

08:08.866 --> 08:10.488
and we're still doing it.

08:10.508 --> 08:13.691
One of the few great collections of sets when you think about it, isn't it?

08:13.771 --> 08:18.275
Right, yeah.

08:18.295 --> 08:19.576
There are the yellowbacks, too.

08:19.676 --> 08:21.979
Yeah, that's actually the Virginian parts.

08:22.079 --> 08:24.201
I'm sorry, yeah.

08:24.501 --> 08:28.585
But yeah, the yellowbacks are in here.

08:28.605 --> 08:31.568
That's right.

08:31.588 --> 08:34.711
Oh, there they are.

08:34.731 --> 08:35.852
Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

08:37.857 --> 08:39.479
Sorry about this furniture.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.501
I can again open up.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.242
No, it's fine.

08:42.402 --> 08:43.243
No, it's fine.

08:49.551 --> 08:52.354
So it's like a time capsule collection, isn't it?

08:52.774 --> 08:53.996
It really does speak for time.

08:54.196 --> 08:58.641
Yeah.

08:58.681 --> 09:02.025
That's being used right now.

09:04.452 --> 09:09.658
Now, you said you had, I think the figure was 25 million manuscript items in this building?

09:09.678 --> 09:09.858
No.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.319
No, they're not housed here.

09:11.339 --> 09:20.489
They're processed here, they're used here, but we have a special building on campus called the Southern Regional Library Facility.

09:21.370 --> 09:29.299
There's a whole floor dedicated to special collections there, and I'd say about 99.9 of the manuscript collections are there.

09:29.339 --> 09:31.641
It occupies almost eight miles of shelf.

09:32.397 --> 09:37.345
And if you want something, you request it here, and you bring it... It's all done on the computer.

09:37.466 --> 09:51.669
On our Orion system, there's a record for every collection, and then on that record is a status screen that, on a box-by-box item, box-by-box level, it says where the box is shelved.

09:52.611 --> 09:56.177
Readers use a finding aid here, a list that says...

09:56.731 --> 09:58.613
All right, let's take the California ephemera.

09:58.653 --> 10:00.015
They're interested in Caltech.

10:00.035 --> 10:01.236
They get the finding aid out.

10:01.256 --> 10:03.439
They see that it's box 83.

10:04.140 --> 10:05.261
We put the request in.

10:05.301 --> 10:07.403
It's here at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

10:07.443 --> 10:10.106
And then it stays here as long as the reader wants to use it.

10:10.126 --> 10:10.807
Oh, that's great.

10:11.128 --> 10:12.049
That's pretty prompt.

10:12.269 --> 10:15.312
If your request is in by 11, you will have it by 3.

10:15.332 --> 10:16.614
That's extraordinary.

10:16.634 --> 10:17.695
Most places will take longer.

10:18.216 --> 10:20.559
Well, their building is not on campus.

10:20.619 --> 10:24.443
See, ours is on campus, and it's also shared by the other four

10:25.773 --> 10:31.701
University of California campus is in the south, but it's not on their campus, it's on ours, so that's why we had that.

10:31.721 --> 10:35.867
That's right, that was one of the things they had to, you know, press the stuff in.

10:35.967 --> 10:42.095
Right, and we have a van, and we have a process to get the stuff over here pretty quickly.

10:42.115 --> 10:42.977
That's very nice.

10:43.017 --> 10:48.544
Yeah, but when you asked about, this is the back of the thing.

10:48.564 --> 10:53.451
Oh, by the way, this is what we're wearing, this is what we're wearing materials in.

10:54.443 --> 10:56.065
This is an orchestra collection.

10:56.646 --> 10:59.130
The blue ones are ours, the red ones are Berkley's.

10:59.170 --> 11:04.638
We have an exchange with them, but whatever you ask for is something like that.

11:04.678 --> 11:05.299
Okay.

11:05.319 --> 11:08.023
That was an early one.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.789
Relatively early one.

11:11.849 --> 11:13.251
They're on the shelf in order.

11:13.271 --> 11:14.252
Here's Ward Ritchie's.

11:17.197 --> 11:21.844
In order of completion, not an alphabetical one.

11:21.884 --> 11:24.147
That's fine.

11:24.464 --> 11:25.746
We're fairly automated.

11:25.786 --> 11:29.710
We do our finding aids on a D-based system.

11:30.111 --> 11:38.360
One of my staff and my senior manuscripts processor wrote an article in Real Books and Manuscripts Librarianship about how we process that way.

11:41.224 --> 11:43.586
That's more of the children's books over there.

11:43.647 --> 11:46.930
We've kind of got them wherever we can shell them.

11:46.950 --> 11:54.099
And then, finally, there's just one more process in the manuscript as well.

11:54.119 --> 11:54.319
Thank you.

11:55.092 --> 11:56.033
That's a good question.

11:57.435 --> 12:02.342
Is everything pretty much, are you pretty much up to date on cataloging?

12:04.466 --> 12:04.846
Sort of.

12:07.129 --> 12:16.763
With our Orion system, let's start with books, we don't have complete cataloging for everything, but we have an in-process record for almost everything.

12:16.823 --> 12:23.513
There are, out of the 310,000 books, I would say maybe only...

12:24.488 --> 12:31.276
about 50,000 do not have an online record of some sort, but they might have cards in the card catalog.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.340
We're still trying to convert things to the online system.

12:34.921 --> 12:39.506
For the manuscripts collection, virtually every collection has a collection level description.

12:40.347 --> 12:50.800
Now, to what extent the collection then has a finding aid to go with it and how detailed that finding aid is, that's where we get into the realm of how well processed is a collection.

12:51.488 --> 12:55.555
The W. W. Robinson papers are processed almost to the item level.

12:56.637 --> 13:08.118
The papers of the 1984 Olympic Organizing Committee, which runs to 1,400 of these dock boxes, are processed to the folder level only, and they're 30,000 folders.

13:10.282 --> 13:11.144
Do you really want that?

13:12.586 --> 13:13.648
Yeah, it's used.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.565
Yeah, the Barcelona people were here for a long time.

13:18.905 --> 13:19.986
That's a good point.

13:20.006 --> 13:21.568
You don't know what's going to be.

13:21.588 --> 13:22.409
You don't, do you?

13:22.429 --> 13:24.832
That's exactly the point.

13:27.935 --> 13:31.298
But anyway, I mean, this is the back room.

13:31.318 --> 13:32.380
This is the grunt area.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.925
The last thing to show you is the stack.

13:38.626 --> 13:40.328
This is about...

13:42.687 --> 13:48.432
half of the rare book collection, other than what you saw in the rooms upstairs.

13:49.193 --> 13:52.676
So the rest of the Sadler books are you going to find under L.C.

13:52.716 --> 13:56.060
classification and the PRs for English literature.

13:57.001 --> 14:06.369
Oh, I know what I want to do.

14:06.389 --> 14:10.213
We don't lock the vaults at all, but I just want you to see how it happened on the show.

14:11.290 --> 14:15.115
I was going to show you this one.

14:15.135 --> 14:16.237
This is the old vault, huh?

14:16.357 --> 14:20.823
Yeah, but I mean, the whole floor could serve that purpose.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.529
Let me just see if I have one goodie to show you.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.393
Okay, this is fun.

14:30.878 --> 14:35.664
This is a proof copy of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.

14:36.686 --> 14:37.787
It's all proof copy?

14:37.807 --> 14:39.610
Yeah, with her corrections in it.

14:40.180 --> 14:46.769
It's really fragile, but... Look at that.

14:47.851 --> 14:48.973
I'll try and find it.

14:48.993 --> 14:52.878
It says First Proof, and it's a presentation copy.

14:52.918 --> 14:56.203
I forgot who Jacques is.

14:56.223 --> 14:58.286
6th February 25, Mrs. Follower.

14:58.586 --> 14:59.467
That's love.

14:59.488 --> 15:00.168
Oh, Virginia.

15:02.352 --> 15:08.280
And let's see, somewhere along in here are some...

15:09.509 --> 15:10.871
serious annotations.

15:10.931 --> 15:12.973
There's not a lot in here, actually.

15:14.815 --> 15:16.977
Enough to make it certainly a variant, did you think?

15:17.438 --> 15:17.818
I'm sorry?

15:18.119 --> 15:19.580
Would you say this is a variant?

15:19.600 --> 15:24.526
Well, it's a proof, so it wasn't the first issue even.

15:24.866 --> 15:31.313
Oh, here's something, where she typed something in like this and crossed that out.

15:31.434 --> 15:35.398
And so it went off back to the publishers and then

15:35.902 --> 15:40.146
The first printed edition will show this in it rather than what was in it.

15:40.166 --> 15:43.929
Which makes it a very, very good collectible item, doesn't it, in the first edition.

15:44.369 --> 15:47.792
For scholars today, where everyone's writing on the computers, you don't see that the vision is so small.

15:48.172 --> 15:57.000
No, you don't, unless people are archiving to disk one version, and every time they sit down, they copy it and then start on the next.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.962
Only if they're thinking of prosperity.

15:59.022 --> 16:02.925
Yeah, and who is, right?

16:04.707 --> 16:05.267
I don't know.

16:05.669 --> 16:06.670
It's a practical matter.

16:06.690 --> 16:09.153
You just keep revising and saving, you know.

16:10.835 --> 16:11.956
Yeah.

16:13.558 --> 16:14.839
George V. Higgins.

16:14.859 --> 16:17.242
Oh, this is Second Addiction.

16:17.262 --> 16:17.983
That's another area.

16:18.023 --> 16:19.965
We have Raymond Chandler's papers.

16:23.409 --> 16:24.730
This is great.

16:24.810 --> 16:28.334
So this is nice.

16:28.395 --> 16:29.736
Condition seems to have been...

16:29.885 --> 16:33.390
I'll bet you Larry set that standard from the beginning, didn't he?

16:33.410 --> 16:41.821
And when we're trying to adhere to it, I mean, you'll find very few shabby books in the collection, and we also look for completeness.

16:43.203 --> 16:53.957
We're not very much into collecting bindings, so we'd rather have a complete text with an ordinary binding than something with an American binding.

16:53.977 --> 16:57.802
I don't see where that belongs in the University Research Library, especially this day.

16:57.922 --> 16:59.284
What bindings?

16:59.551 --> 17:00.914
Not in and of themselves.

17:01.255 --> 17:12.582
I mean, in the Albion collection, we have some Grolier bindings, but that came... It's sort of incidental to...

17:14.148 --> 17:16.671
Well, again, any subject areas of interest?

17:16.691 --> 17:17.872
No, I think we've covered it.

17:17.892 --> 17:20.595
Do you think we could go over to the Clark guy?

17:20.816 --> 17:23.158
I'll show you how to do that.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.743
No, we might have to make a call from here.

17:26.783 --> 17:32.770
I called yesterday, and they told me I couldn't get in unless he... I guess Dr. Hall, was that his name?

17:32.870 --> 17:33.691
Yeah, Michael Hall.

17:33.771 --> 17:35.373
He was here with you, I think, yesterday.

17:36.254 --> 17:38.576
The building was begun in 1925.

17:39.557 --> 17:41.860
The architect's name is Robert Farquhar.

17:42.498 --> 17:44.261
He was classically trained in Paris.

17:44.781 --> 17:49.468
He studied the École des Beaux-Arts for about six years, became very familiar with Baroque style.

17:50.530 --> 17:59.684
And Clark decided in the early 20s his collection was overrunning his house and he needed a separate place for it.

18:00.124 --> 18:05.152
So he commissioned Farquhar to build this library.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.375
This particular book room is...

18:09.025 --> 18:13.531
based on a library room at the Chateau de Chantilly.

18:13.771 --> 18:22.543
They have a very long library there that looks just like this with this lovely mezzanine here in a rectangular shape.

18:22.563 --> 18:26.208
In here are the earliest works in Clark's collection.

18:26.629 --> 18:32.036
He began with Elizabethan authors collecting the folios of Shakespeare.

18:32.076 --> 18:34.980
There's a complete set in this bookcase here.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.063
These are the four folios over here?

18:37.163 --> 18:37.243
Yes.

18:39.839 --> 18:44.946
Did he acquire these himself, or did he have somebody doing it for him?

18:45.066 --> 18:52.456
Well, he did have book dealers who looked out for him, but he took a very active interest in his collection at all times.

18:52.496 --> 18:55.760
He was most unusual in that he never bought up libraries.

18:56.241 --> 19:02.749
He specifically went after books, certain unique books.

19:03.330 --> 19:04.111
What am I trying to say?

19:04.531 --> 19:08.817
Individual books, that's what I mean, rather than getting another man's collection.

19:09.117 --> 19:09.738
Exactly.

19:10.799 --> 19:22.171
In the bookcases over on this side are 19th century first editions, and you'll see the originals of the Charles Dickens when Bleak House came out in serial form.

19:23.352 --> 19:23.672
In parts.

19:24.253 --> 19:25.834
That's right.

19:25.855 --> 19:36.846
And the mezzanine above us, from about here all the way to the end, are the complete works and

19:37.315 --> 19:39.679
prose and plays of Oscar Wilde.

19:40.320 --> 19:47.010
We have the largest institutional repository of Wilde's writings, including his manuscripts.

19:48.612 --> 19:52.458
Richard Ellman based most of his research on the Clark collection.

19:54.321 --> 19:56.965
This was added to the Clark collection?

19:57.005 --> 19:58.988
This is again Mr. Clark collecting.

19:59.789 --> 20:02.032
This was his modern author.

20:04.296 --> 20:05.938
I should mention that after

20:06.509 --> 20:15.799
He came on the market starting as most late 19th century, early 20th century collectors did with Shakespeare and 19th century first editions.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.264
Folger and Huntington had already been making great inroads.

20:20.704 --> 20:35.200
Prices were high and Clarke decided he needed to specialize in an area that people weren't interested in and very cleverly he chose Restoration England and centered his collection around the works of John Dryden.

20:36.091 --> 20:38.975
When we go into the South Book Room, I'll talk more about that.

20:41.099 --> 20:42.521
This was built as a private library.

20:42.621 --> 20:43.382
Yes, it was.

20:43.843 --> 20:48.289
If you notice, the bookcases are made of bronze, not wood.

20:48.309 --> 20:49.071
I've never seen bronze.

20:50.252 --> 20:51.895
You might wonder where Clark got his wealth.

20:52.035 --> 20:54.279
His father was an early pioneer.

20:54.339 --> 21:03.853
He came from Philadelphia during the Civil War, settled in Montana because he found a very good vein of copper ore there and started an empire.

21:04.373 --> 21:05.995
None of the children had to work for a living.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.657
They all inherited large sums of money.

21:08.298 --> 21:15.667
Although Clark did graduate from the University of Virginia with a law degree and practiced law for one year.

21:15.988 --> 21:19.652
Were they Californians, did you say?

21:19.692 --> 21:20.073
No.

21:20.273 --> 21:24.478
The great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, settled in Philadelphia.

21:25.279 --> 21:30.786
Clark's father, the senator, came west to Montana, and Clark was born in Butte, Montana.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.825
Were other Clark family members book collectors, or was he the only one?

21:36.845 --> 21:38.387
Yes, his brother Charles was.

21:38.468 --> 21:45.818
He had an interesting collection of French literature and incunabula.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.225
He had a lot of personal problems.

21:50.305 --> 21:55.352
He was a gambler and an alcoholic, and before he died, he'd lost most of his collection.

21:56.193 --> 21:58.016
Oh, so none of the incunables are here then?

21:58.176 --> 21:58.436
No.

21:58.737 --> 22:02.983
We do have a little bit of incunabula here, but not a lot.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.964
That wasn't Clark's focus.

22:05.984 --> 22:06.905
That was not his interest.

22:06.925 --> 22:07.405
That's right.

22:09.507 --> 22:09.667
Great.

22:09.868 --> 22:12.030
When we're done, maybe if I could just shoot a couple pictures.

22:12.050 --> 22:12.250
Sure.

22:12.270 --> 22:15.192
Suzanne, I didn't get your full name, just so I could know it.

22:15.212 --> 22:16.634
And how do you spell that?

22:16.934 --> 22:18.275
T-A-T-I-A-N.

22:18.295 --> 22:18.636
Great.

22:18.656 --> 22:23.920
Thank you.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.722
Well, we have events.

22:25.742 --> 22:26.883
People come in through the front door.

22:27.804 --> 22:31.367
And it started out on this marble vestibule.

22:32.191 --> 22:37.677
In 1919, Farquhar had fashioned a mausoleum for Clark, which was a thing to do in the 20s.

22:37.777 --> 22:38.939
It's at the Hollywood Cemetery.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.400
It looks like a little Greek temple.

22:40.420 --> 22:44.625
And inside, he did this marvelous marble mosaic floor.

22:45.086 --> 22:48.850
And Clark asked him to do the same thing in the library.

22:49.391 --> 22:55.718
So he chose about 14 varieties of very rare Roman and Greek marble.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.785
The man who did the ceiling is Alan Cox.

23:00.966 --> 23:02.548
He was a muralist.

23:02.588 --> 23:10.398
His father was a muralist, Kenyon Cox of New York, and his mother was a portrait painter, so he learned from an early age.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.581
He too was classically trained.

23:12.621 --> 23:18.448
He spent his early life at the American Academy at Rome.

23:19.171 --> 23:21.495
was a devotee of Michelangelo.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.741
So he and Farquhar, the architect, made a very good team.

23:26.824 --> 23:32.334
The Celia is a tribute to Clark's interest in the humanities.

23:32.354 --> 23:36.061
There's Apollo here with his mother Leto and the nine dioses.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.908
And then in the individual niches are symbols of Clark's interest.

23:39.928 --> 23:41.871
For instance, he was an amateur violinist.

23:42.087 --> 23:48.298
who established the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1919.

23:48.318 --> 23:56.752
He was also interested in astronomy, so we have our military sphere.

23:56.772 --> 23:57.754
Books over here.

23:57.774 --> 24:00.478
The condition of these books is magnificent.

24:00.499 --> 24:01.300
The condition is called extraordinary.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.883
And then Zach was interested in not just painting, but architectural painting.

24:02.903 --> 24:03.724
There was a T-square and a triangle here.

24:04.008 --> 24:33.694
This is the bus at the center.

24:35.108 --> 24:36.270
Isn't this splendid?

24:39.496 --> 24:41.720
Was his house as lavish as this on the grounds?

24:41.920 --> 24:42.602
Well, no.

24:42.882 --> 24:54.603
His house was built just about the turn of the century, and it was a nice, large, craftsman-looking house, but of no particular architectural distinction.

24:55.144 --> 24:59.412
The special thing about this library was that Clark could give Farquhar a blank check.

24:59.645 --> 25:06.014
And so the finest materials were used and the best craftsmen because Farquhar and the painter Alan Cox were perfectionists.

25:07.216 --> 25:12.905
This room is a special tribute to Clark's interest in his author John Dryden.

25:12.965 --> 25:14.226
His portrait sits right there.

25:14.867 --> 25:17.151
Is that a contemporary portrait of Dryden?

25:17.171 --> 25:17.471
Yes.

25:18.913 --> 25:23.901
The murals are depicting Clark's favorite Dryden play which is All for Love.

25:25.543 --> 25:28.167
On this side we have All for Love and on this side

25:28.906 --> 25:32.831
Shakespeare's Angenean Cleopatra, from which it was adapted.

25:33.633 --> 25:46.531
And on the ceilings, not only do you have more scenes from the play, but some vignettes of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphosis, because, of course, Dryden's later part of life translated a great deal for a joint Ovid.

25:55.022 --> 25:56.084
Beautiful.

25:56.444 --> 25:56.905
Oh.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.393
I was just pausing to see if you had any questions.

26:01.756 --> 26:02.677
What kind of wood?

26:02.697 --> 26:03.518
This is English oak.

26:03.559 --> 26:05.782
It's all hand carved.

26:05.802 --> 26:09.306
It was carved in New York and then shipped across by train and fitted in here.

26:09.887 --> 26:22.384
In fact, the murals that Cox has done here were painted in his New York studio, which is quite amazing because you look at the perspective, which is absolutely perfect.

26:22.404 --> 26:26.790
The figures do look like they're dangling down from a story above.

26:27.142 --> 26:29.927
He simply rolled up the canvases and came across and installed them.

26:32.451 --> 26:39.042
There's a portrait of Clark right here, and he's sitting in one of the chairs here in the library.

26:39.703 --> 26:46.594
All of the furniture here, by the way, is good 20th century reproduction, except for a few pieces, yes.

26:47.916 --> 26:51.462
Yeah, a Pasadena firm called Hunt.

26:52.201 --> 26:54.269
designed specifically for the library.

26:55.052 --> 26:57.179
A few things are antique, but not many.

26:58.023 --> 26:59.528
Carl Sanders, his

26:59.862 --> 27:04.608
assistant who became a librarian here when Clark died in 1934.

27:04.628 --> 27:06.650
She ran the library until 1941.

27:07.952 --> 27:19.666
And over here is Robert Cowan, a San Francisco bibliographer who came to catalog Clark's works when it became too much of a task for Clark and his secretary Cora.

27:20.587 --> 27:29.278
They envisioned that this would take Robert Cowan about six months and ended up taking him 13 years.

27:33.899 --> 27:42.311
set of volumes that he produced which have been printed by San Francisco printer John Henry Nash on the Clark collection.

27:42.331 --> 27:43.592
There's about 20 volumes here.

27:44.954 --> 27:45.835
I'll just open a page.

27:45.855 --> 27:46.957
Is this a catalog of the collection?

27:46.977 --> 27:49.180
Yes, this is Cowan's work here.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.802
This is on one aspect of the collection.

27:51.864 --> 27:56.390
I should explain to you, there's three parts to Clark's collection that we've developed.

27:58.032 --> 28:03.720
British literature and culture, 17th and 18th century, namely the years 1640 to 1750.

28:04.342 --> 28:12.419
and then Oscar Wilde in the 1890s, and fine printing, which is what this represents.

28:14.985 --> 28:24.325
Sure.

28:24.457 --> 28:29.806
It's so wonderful to work here too.

28:29.827 --> 28:31.249
Yeah, I mean you must be tickled every day.

28:31.269 --> 28:31.349
Yes.

28:31.369 --> 28:31.750
Thank you so much.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.393
I know we took you out on a very busy, difficult day.

28:33.413 --> 28:36.418
I've seen the computers all out and things are not wonderful.

28:36.438 --> 28:46.837
Yeah, that's quite alright.

28:46.857 --> 28:47.257
It's beautiful.

28:47.278 --> 28:47.578
These are fine?

28:50.056 --> 29:15.507
and the shutters in the drawing room were also ruins do you think he chose that for analytics uh protection or just yes he did um farquhar took a tour of libraries back east before he even designed this library and he um he left the j pierpont morgan library and uh paid particularly close attention to them he went back there three times he even wrote letters to clark about his um journeys

29:15.942 --> 29:21.651
He chose very thick glass shelving because he thought wood would warp and metal would corrode.

29:21.671 --> 29:25.137
And so he wanted something more caring for the books.

29:25.157 --> 29:30.646
And he also has ventilation built in so we have enough air circulation so mold can't develop.

29:31.167 --> 29:39.300
He's also managed to double-pane the windows and slant them so that the sunlight comes towards the center of the room rather than hitting the spines of the books.

29:39.280 --> 29:50.273
He's taken a great deal of care and attention in how he's going to provide the environment.

29:50.293 --> 30:00.705
I'll just show you the South Book Room.

30:04.910 --> 30:06.992
This is an antique, actually.

30:07.580 --> 30:11.807
maybe 14th, 15th century walnut refectory table from Italy.

30:13.850 --> 30:20.321
And we have a very nice little pocket wheel over here, which you could have bought in a twacking shop in London.

30:20.341 --> 30:24.367
And this one's special because it's showing the new constellations of Dr. Halley.

30:24.387 --> 30:29.876
And it's also completing Australia and New Zealand because Captain Cook by then had circumnavigated the globe.

30:30.557 --> 30:32.220
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

30:33.247 --> 30:37.333
In this room is the core of our 17th and 18th century collection.

30:37.874 --> 30:41.539
The works of John Dryden are right over there in those cabinets.

30:42.341 --> 30:46.246
What makes a collection so fine is the depth of it.

30:47.168 --> 30:59.406
Clark made sure that he collected not only every edition of Dryden's work that he could get his hands on, but copies of each edition because there wasn't such a thing as...

31:00.955 --> 31:02.798
uniformity in the printing world.

31:02.838 --> 31:03.940
Paper was expensive.

31:04.381 --> 31:11.793
If a printer found errors in the text, he would correct as he went, so that one person's copy might be different from another's.

31:11.853 --> 31:20.247
Not only that, but the printer had a great deal more control over the manuscript, and he could expurgate if he wanted, depending on the government

31:20.783 --> 31:23.906
censorship and whether he thought he might get into trouble.

31:24.006 --> 31:30.453
So it's good to have several editions and see how the work changes so you can get close to what the author might have been saying.

31:30.473 --> 31:31.874
Did Mr. Clarke have a family?

31:32.415 --> 31:34.016
Was this his family?

31:34.036 --> 31:36.979
Yeah, this almost was his family and the people who worked for him.

31:37.340 --> 31:42.925
He married in 1901 and had one son.

31:42.965 --> 31:47.770
His name was William Andrews Clarke III, or Tertius for short.

31:48.526 --> 32:01.409
His wife died a month after their son was born, so he married again a few years later, Alice McManus Clark, who came from Virginia City, and they didn't produce any children.

32:01.429 --> 32:02.992
It was an eight-year marriage, and she died.

32:03.994 --> 32:09.003
And then his son died in an airplane accident in 1932, two years before he died.

32:09.704 --> 32:13.150
So he really has no direct descendant.

32:13.720 --> 32:17.725
Which may be one of the reasons that he built this library.

32:17.746 --> 32:22.011
Well, this library was built about 10 years before Tertius died.

32:26.678 --> 32:36.491
Tertius wasn't interested in the library, so Clark asked the University of California if they would be interested, and he thought he would set it up as a memorial to his father, who had died in 25.

32:38.053 --> 32:42.259
And he arranged for the deed to be passed on after his death.

32:43.758 --> 32:49.563
It's really magnificent.

32:49.583 --> 32:53.287
The condition of the books is just extraordinary, isn't it?

32:53.347 --> 32:56.910
What was the approximate size of his collection?

32:56.930 --> 33:06.559
When he died, I think that the library gained about 13,000 volumes and manuscripts, and we now have over 90,000 we continue to collect.

33:06.579 --> 33:08.221
Did he leave funding for additional loans?

33:08.241 --> 33:08.681
Yes, he did.

33:08.701 --> 33:13.005
He left a very generous endowment, which the university invested, and we spend the interest

33:13.120 --> 33:15.402
to run the library and to buy the books every year.

33:15.703 --> 33:23.891
I don't think I'm at liberty to say.

33:23.971 --> 33:28.176
Well, I could consult, you know, and tell you.

33:28.736 --> 33:30.158
It's small, but I'm just curious.

33:31.119 --> 33:32.420
It's not large enough these days.

33:32.540 --> 33:39.668
I was curious to see how, because I know most of the others, and I was just wondering how it compares, like, to the $500,000 that John Carter Brown,

33:40.222 --> 33:43.765
It was an enormous summer in those days, but which is nothing today.

33:43.805 --> 33:47.349
Nothing seems to be great enough to keep up with the location of God.

33:47.369 --> 33:49.130
But you certainly keep the place beautifully.

33:49.150 --> 33:51.332
There's no chipping paint, so far as I can see.

33:51.532 --> 33:51.873
No.

33:52.053 --> 33:55.816
Well, everything is so well made, it's easy to keep the place.

33:55.836 --> 34:00.701
You know, they didn't cut any corners when they built this.

34:00.721 --> 34:03.804
The grounds are lovely, and you use the garden to be the garden.

34:04.144 --> 34:08.188
Yes.

34:08.208 --> 34:08.288
Yes.

34:08.740 --> 34:12.646
So this is run quite independently of the main campus at UCLA?

34:14.749 --> 34:20.397
Well, because we're off campus, yes, in a way it is.

34:20.918 --> 34:23.141
But we are owned by the university.

34:23.181 --> 34:24.663
We follow university policy.

34:25.284 --> 34:26.926
Anyone can use our collection.

34:26.966 --> 34:28.649
They do not have to be scholars.

34:29.170 --> 34:35.018
We often have the general public dropping in, although most of our readership is

34:35.875 --> 34:43.103
postdoctoral international scholars because we offer fellowships and people can come here and study for a month or several months at a time.

34:43.123 --> 34:52.374
We give them a stipend and we give them that cubicle downstairs and they can start a library of their own from our library.

34:52.514 --> 34:59.082
Unlike most of the UCLA libraries, we are a non-circulating collection so people do have to come down here to see the books.

35:00.563 --> 35:02.987
Do you get funds from the state?

35:03.307 --> 35:08.716
We get funds from the state only for the library and salaries.

35:08.756 --> 35:11.120
The endowment pays for almost everything.

35:11.140 --> 35:18.231
Including new acquisitions and conservation and all that other stuff is done.

35:18.251 --> 35:19.533
It's not unlike the J.C.

35:19.653 --> 35:24.040
Brown and the Clintons in that respect.

35:24.661 --> 35:32.274
Okay, well listen, I, you know, I'm trapped in.

35:33.657 --> 35:35.300
I think we'll just be directed across.

35:35.320 --> 35:35.600
Yeah.

35:35.620 --> 35:36.522
Is that the modern-looking film?

35:36.542 --> 35:37.043
Yes, it is.

35:37.063 --> 35:38.826
There's nothing else in the shows upstairs, or this is basically it?

35:38.846 --> 35:39.687
This is it.

35:39.707 --> 35:39.848
Uh-huh.

35:39.908 --> 35:42.332
Let me just check with Fran that she has one of those.
