WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:05.873
We're speaking with Matthew Kirschenbaum.

00:07.175 --> 00:11.302
Okay, Matthew, tell me a little bit about yourself and what we're doing.

00:11.322 --> 00:23.102
Well, I'm the project manager with the William Blake Archive here at the Institute for Advanced Technology and Humanities.

00:23.563 --> 00:24.504
Red lights on, right?

00:24.985 --> 00:26.207
Yes.

00:26.997 --> 00:34.184
And the Blake Archive is actually only one of a number of projects that go on here.

00:34.204 --> 00:47.818
Basically, the Institute takes on several new fellows each year, either from within the University of Virginia or, as in the case of the Blake Archive, from other institutions.

00:48.759 --> 00:54.405
And all of these people have research projects that they want to pursue.

00:54.976 --> 01:03.765
in the humanities that they need the Institute's expertise in advanced computing technology for.

01:04.646 --> 01:18.121
The projects that are chosen here are chosen not only in terms of their humanities content, so to speak, the importance of that.

01:18.701 --> 01:22.165
It says Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities.

01:24.355 --> 01:49.899
But the projects are chosen as not only for their content, but also for the extent to which they'll permit us to do research and development work with various computing technologies that can then be applied to other humanities projects in addition to the particular one that the fellow might be working on.

01:49.919 --> 01:52.962
Just to give you an idea of some of the things that

01:53.212 --> 02:01.503
go on here at the Blake Archive, which I'll tell you more about, is an electronic editing project.

02:01.523 --> 02:23.033
Basically, the idea is to provide scholars and students with access to Blake's works in a way which is not possible with color, facsimile, reproductions of the work in print, because it's simply too expensive to produce

02:23.418 --> 02:52.159
high quality facsimiles the various books that blake printed all exist in multiple copied copies and there are differences in coloring differences in the order in which the plates are printed among all of them and typically when these are reproduced even in facsimile form it's only possible to reproduce one copy of a given book so what the blake archive is doing electronically is making

02:52.308 --> 02:56.393
multiple copies of the various illuminated books available.

02:56.413 --> 02:58.796
So you're getting very in place and stuff like that.

02:58.816 --> 02:59.377
Exactly.

02:59.477 --> 03:03.301
And is this the headquarters for the Blake project here?

03:03.502 --> 03:17.158
It is, and physically you're sitting in the Institute, which is the headquarters not only for the Blake project, but also for, I would say, 15 to 20 other humanities computing research projects.

03:17.178 --> 03:18.720
So how is it for the Virginia?

03:19.122 --> 03:22.628
that comes to the headquarters for this project?

03:23.229 --> 03:33.786
Well, the Institute was founded about five years ago with a grant from IBM of about $3 million, I believe.

03:34.968 --> 03:42.480
And IBM had decided they wanted to donate this money to the university and

03:44.013 --> 04:04.064
The decision to spend it on a humanities computing search institute was basically driven by the idea that humanities scholars have certain unique needs which would actually present important and interesting R&D problems to computer scientists.

04:04.365 --> 04:09.733
One example that is immediately relevant to the Blake archive concerns images

04:10.135 --> 04:25.114
If you've done work with digital text, you know that it's very difficult to do anything meaningful with images other than just look at them, typically on the web or in electronic editions.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.516
They're ornamental.

04:26.536 --> 04:31.021
They're just static attachments to the database.

04:31.962 --> 04:37.189
So one of the questions that the Blake Archive is investigating is how can one

04:37.388 --> 04:44.378
take the images and turn them into a functional part of the database, something that can be searched in the same way as the text.

04:45.420 --> 04:56.596
And that's an important question not only for Blake, but it has, as you can imagine, broader applications outside of just this project.

04:57.017 --> 05:00.101
Well, how was it that Blake was selected?

05:00.121 --> 05:04.948
Well, partly because one of the

05:05.435 --> 05:10.101
The Institute has several electronic editing projects underway.

05:10.762 --> 05:15.688
In addition to Blake, there's also a project on Rossetti.

05:15.748 --> 05:18.472
He was a maybe 19th century poet and painter.

05:18.932 --> 05:23.358
There's an Emily Dickinson and a Walt Whitman archive underway.

05:23.979 --> 05:26.502
So, currently I'm out of here.

05:27.343 --> 05:32.590
Based here, but like the Blake project, the Dickinson and the Whitman project are being

05:32.772 --> 05:36.277
edited by scholars who are based at other universities.

05:36.297 --> 05:46.072
So, of course, you mentioned Dickinson, where you scan the actual faxicles that you wrote poems on, which are owned, I guess, by Harvard and Amherst.

05:46.092 --> 05:46.272
Right.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.614
So how does that work?

05:48.155 --> 05:50.118
How do you get around that?

05:50.198 --> 05:59.873
The scanning is done typically, in the case of Dickinson and Blake, from first-generation transparencies of the materials.

05:59.913 --> 06:00.754
Which already exist.

06:01.072 --> 06:02.394
Not always.

06:02.694 --> 06:08.982
We negotiate with the various libraries and museums that hold the original materials.

06:10.023 --> 06:20.035
And they either, if they have the transparencies on hand, they will let us use them for a fee.

06:20.676 --> 06:24.380
Or if they're not on hand, then they will shoot them for us.

06:25.382 --> 06:29.847
And it's certainly been a, it's taken a long time.

06:30.417 --> 06:49.795
time to... Well, you were asking me why Blake was chosen.

06:49.815 --> 06:59.985
And usually one of the reasons Blake was chosen is that if you look at the way that he's typically been edited in print, if you look at, say, Erdman's

07:00.320 --> 07:12.959
standard edition of Blake's poetry and prose, what you see is mainly plain, hypothetical text with some illustrations, but those are few and far between.

07:13.900 --> 07:25.417
So the effect of that is to turn Blake, who was as much of an artist and an engraver, into a poet in the most orthodox sense of the word.

07:26.499 --> 07:30.124
So Blake was of interest partly because

07:30.425 --> 07:36.714
he has not been adequately edited in print.

07:38.056 --> 07:46.810
And again, that's due, I think, less to scholars being unaware of the importance of the visual dimensions of his work.

07:46.830 --> 07:53.319
I think people are very much aware of that, but it's due more to simply economic reasons.

07:53.339 --> 07:58.407
It's expensive to produce high-quality facsimiles and

07:58.893 --> 08:03.598
material like that in a printed book.

08:04.058 --> 08:06.821
Can you tell me a little bit about your work and what it is that you know?

08:06.841 --> 08:21.195
Well, I'm just, I'm really interested in... The Library of Congress actually has an extensive Blake collection.

08:21.215 --> 08:21.816
It's the A.V.

08:21.856 --> 08:24.799
Rosenwald Collection, and you'll notice there

08:25.032 --> 08:35.883
They're listed as one of the sponsors of the archive, and that's because they gave us permission to reproduce the contents of that collection.

08:36.784 --> 08:50.398
Joe Viscomi, who's at Chapel Hill, went up there with a photographer and spent several weeks shooting the contents of the Rosenwald Blake Collection.

08:50.952 --> 08:55.177
The archive has been underway for about two years.

08:55.437 --> 09:01.163
We're in the third year of a... So 95 is when it started?

09:01.183 --> 09:14.478
We're in the third year of a three-year grant from the Getty Art Institute, who are the primary funders for the project at this point.

09:14.518 --> 09:19.744
Just to give you some numbers that will give you an idea of the

09:20.095 --> 09:27.062
the scope and the scale of things, the archive will include about 3,000 digital images.

09:30.966 --> 09:38.033
Blake printed about 20 different illuminated books during the course of his career.

09:38.554 --> 09:43.078
Each of those illuminated books exists in multiple copies.

09:43.599 --> 09:48.904
There are about 150 copies of all of the books that survive.

09:49.306 --> 09:56.936
The Blake Archive will reproduce between 50 or 60 of those, or about a third of the extant copies of those.

09:57.056 --> 09:59.499
Why did I try to get all of them?

09:59.559 --> 10:05.186
Partly simply because of time and labor, there's only so much that one could do.

10:05.206 --> 10:06.247
A number of them are privately owned.

10:06.368 --> 10:16.140
A number of them are privately owned, and as I said, the materials are held by any number of different libraries, and each of them has

10:16.660 --> 10:20.283
unique feelings about reproducing them.

10:20.724 --> 10:24.287
And the scholarly value of something like that would be?

10:24.768 --> 10:25.388
Several things.

10:25.468 --> 10:34.537
For one thing, I'm thinking first from the library's point of view, it will, we hope, reduce wear and tear on the physical artifacts.

10:35.778 --> 10:44.727
Nobody is suggesting that a digital archive will ever replace the need that scholars have to

10:45.095 --> 10:55.290
handle the physical materials in all cases, but in many cases a high-quality facsimile might fill that need.

10:55.310 --> 10:58.776
So that's one advantage.

10:59.056 --> 11:13.077
The other thing, or certainly several things, as I said, we can reproduce multiple copies of each of the books, which is something that has never really been done in print.

11:13.293 --> 11:16.858
And the differences between the copies are substantial.

11:16.958 --> 11:23.027
There are things that would be very obvious to a non-Blake expert.

11:23.327 --> 11:33.682
Blake hand-colored all of the books used watercolor paints, and each of them is painted differently.

11:33.782 --> 11:36.306
So that's one difference between the copies.

11:37.287 --> 11:42.034
The ordering of the plates within the copies also moves around

11:42.470 --> 11:58.233
and one of the things that Blake scholars have been interested in is the interpretive significance of those different orderings.

11:58.693 --> 12:02.379
In other words, clearly they weren't just for random and arbitrary reasons.

12:02.399 --> 12:05.003
This was Blake who determined the orderings at each point?

12:05.323 --> 12:11.532
Yeah, I don't know how much you know about Blake, but he was... No, I'm quite fascinated by Blake.

12:12.119 --> 12:32.606
He was responsible for printing his own work, and the technique that he developed, what's been called Eliminated Printing, is unique to his work.

12:32.626 --> 12:39.055
One of the editors on the project, Joe Biscomi, again from Chapel Hill,

12:39.490 --> 12:53.044
made his reputation in Blake's studies by reproducing the physical process that Blake went through in printing his books, which had never been well understood.

12:53.324 --> 13:05.616
The book to go to for that is called Blake and the Idea of the Book by Joe Bisconi.

13:05.637 --> 13:07.118
That was Princeton.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.124
From about 19... Like two years ago?

13:10.144 --> 13:10.945
About 1990.

13:11.345 --> 13:12.547
Yeah.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.990
I know that book.

13:15.010 --> 13:15.491
Mm-hmm.

13:15.511 --> 13:15.931
Joe?

13:16.712 --> 13:19.556
Uh, B-I-S-C-O-M-I.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.220
Is that Tristan?

13:22.721 --> 13:25.204
He's at Chapel Hill.

13:25.224 --> 13:26.766
Mm-hmm.

13:26.786 --> 13:30.511
Tristan University.

13:30.531 --> 13:30.611
Yes.

13:30.631 --> 13:31.512
Okay.

13:31.532 --> 13:36.379
Um, so there are, so there are differences in color, there are differences in the plate orderings,

13:36.815 --> 13:43.565
Let me actually take you into the archive and show you some of the things that we can do.

13:46.610 --> 13:49.374
This is the Look of Fel caveat.

13:49.815 --> 13:55.043
The Book of Fel is one of the earlier books that Blake printed.

13:55.063 --> 13:59.911
And this is essentially the table of contents for the book.

13:59.931 --> 14:03.396
You can see that it consists of eight plates.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.934
and selecting an individual plate.

14:12.057 --> 14:15.762
So he printed the whole book himself, including the type?

14:16.002 --> 14:17.484
Did he set his own type?

14:17.605 --> 14:19.267
Well, he didn't work in type.

14:19.908 --> 14:22.412
So it was all illuminating?

14:22.432 --> 14:23.954
And scripted, yeah.

14:24.254 --> 14:30.623
I mean, he was a fascinating person.

14:30.643 --> 14:36.572
He taught himself Italian so he could illustrate Dante in the original.

14:37.531 --> 14:49.471
What you're looking at is the title plate of Bell, and down here you'll see a number of different options that one has.

14:51.915 --> 15:03.555
You can select an enlargement and see a high-quality reproduction, and this is obviously useful for the study of

15:04.463 --> 15:30.927
details and again these are shots from transparency so nobody's actually handling them that's right they're shot from transparencies and they're all they're color corrected using photoshop adobe photoshop against the original transparency so in terms of color there's a great deal of fidelity to the original

15:31.143 --> 15:38.090
This is a 300 DPI image and the smaller one is a 100 DPI image.

15:40.413 --> 15:45.538
Another interesting thing you'll notice is this control console here.

15:46.599 --> 15:51.784
This is something that was done in a programming language known as Java.

15:51.864 --> 15:53.826
I don't know if I've heard of it.

15:54.948 --> 15:59.192
Java is basically a programming language that is

15:59.628 --> 16:03.654
designed and implemented to work over the Internet.

16:04.375 --> 16:13.127
And what that means is that this is actually a self-contained applet.

16:13.447 --> 16:14.008
Excuse me.

16:14.168 --> 16:15.130
It's a bit of a cough.

16:16.331 --> 16:22.740
This is a self-contained programming application, or applet, as it's known, a Java applet.

16:23.461 --> 16:28.909
And that will anybody who accesses the archive, assuming that

16:29.210 --> 16:41.446
the web browser and the software that they're using is Java-tapable, that browser will be able to execute this Java outlet, in other words, display this control console.

16:43.008 --> 16:49.176
And what this does is this permits us to display the image at its true physical size.

16:49.645 --> 16:54.089
regardless of the resolution of your individual monitor.

16:54.629 --> 17:05.099
If you've spent time looking around the web, you'll notice that if you look at images on different monitors, they'll appear to be different sizes in some cases.

17:05.219 --> 17:18.471
And the reason for that is depending on the resolution of your individual monitor, a higher resolution monitor will display an image of a different size than the lower resolution monitor.

17:18.856 --> 17:25.666
And it was important to us in the Blake archive that people have a sense of the actual physical scale of the image.

17:26.287 --> 17:32.255
Usually when non-specialists think of Blake's work, they tend to imagine it as being very big.

17:32.696 --> 17:35.820
Yeah, they're very tiny.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.843
They're about the size of paperback books.

17:38.212 --> 17:42.678
but people generally have the impression that there are these big poster-sized works.

17:42.698 --> 17:45.002
I handle one that's smaller than that local.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.785
So how do you... Well, I'll show you.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.950
On the first part of the scale there, because I don't get it there.

17:51.270 --> 17:55.496
Well, but what you're looking at here is, in fact, the true size.

17:55.797 --> 17:59.562
You'll notice that the dimensions are provided

18:00.284 --> 18:08.557
And the way this works is that the first time somebody comes into the archive, they select the Calibrate button here.

18:13.504 --> 18:16.068
And this ruler appears on the screen.

18:16.749 --> 18:27.726
And at this point, what you would do is you would take a physical ruler, hold it up against the screen, and match the two using the scroll bars here.

18:37.122 --> 18:44.009
Give it a moment.

18:44.029 --> 18:44.369
There we go.

18:45.571 --> 18:52.638
You would match up the markings on your physical ruler with the one that's here on screen.

18:56.301 --> 19:04.750
And doing this enables the Java applet to determine the resolution of your particular monitor.

19:05.708 --> 19:12.598
And I happen to know that this is about a 68 DPI monitor.

19:12.618 --> 19:34.450
Once you do that, and you come back into the archive, because the applet knows the resolution of the monitor that you're working with, I think I may have gone too small, actually, but because the applet

19:35.071 --> 19:42.442
The op-let knows the resolution of your monitor, and it knows what the true physical dimensions of the image are.

19:42.782 --> 19:47.469
It can match the two and display the digital image at its true size.

19:48.330 --> 19:52.676
As I said, I think I goofed a bit on the calibration.

19:53.037 --> 19:58.665
And I can find some of these other projects that you're working on, besides the lake.

19:58.814 --> 20:03.820
Yeah, if you go back to the IAP homepage, which is in that brochure.

20:06.003 --> 20:14.014
Now, something else that we can do, I was telling you about image searching a little while ago.

20:14.835 --> 20:25.328
Again, I don't know how much you know about digital text projects and so on, but searching text is fairly commonplace.

20:25.662 --> 20:32.789
Catherine, next door, I'm sure, showed you the text searching capabilities that they have.

20:32.809 --> 20:44.821
And what we wanted to do with the Blake archive, in addition to being able to search the text of the poetry, is to essentially build a visual concordance to Blake's work.

20:45.562 --> 20:53.610
If a Blake scholar wanted, for example, to find all of the occurrences of eagles,

20:54.350 --> 20:57.635
on Lake's illuminated plates.

20:58.937 --> 21:16.945
What that person will be able to do once the archive is complete is come into the image search page here and use this controlled vocabulary that we've established.

21:16.965 --> 21:21.792
And select, for example, Eagle, which is what I just checked off.

21:23.375 --> 21:24.256
run the search.

21:29.722 --> 21:37.469
And we see, again, across the Book of Fel copy app is the only thing we're searching on at the moment.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.232
We'll see that we have one hit, like three.

21:41.273 --> 21:42.194
We click on that.

21:45.217 --> 21:46.899
That's pretty good.

21:46.919 --> 21:52.605
We come to a page where we have just some very simple

21:59.656 --> 22:06.866
some very simple descriptive language that describes what it is that's in that center.

22:07.106 --> 22:15.258
But certainly, as the people who are always saying to evaluate this, that's part of the work that the project editors do.

22:15.318 --> 22:20.806
They describe... These are Blake's scholars.

22:20.926 --> 22:28.937
Yeah, the three editors are three internationally known Blake's scholars who have edited Blake's works in France.

22:29.812 --> 22:31.734
And so what's your background?

22:31.755 --> 22:40.025
Well, I'm a graduate student in the English department here, and I'm working on a dissertation on electronic media.

22:40.105 --> 22:50.198
It's being written electronically as a hypertext, so it's an attempt to basically match the medium to the message, so to speak.

22:50.218 --> 22:57.608
And basically my interest in the Blake project is as a way of...

22:58.229 --> 23:16.293
matching the kinds of theoretical interests that I'm pursuing in the dissertation, what is text and the digital medium and so on, with an actual hands-on project that's a fine... So it doesn't bother you that your thesis is not being done in paper?

23:16.733 --> 23:26.987
No, I find that exhilarating, much more interesting than if I were writing and, okay, I have a thesis on 8.5 by 11 inch paper,

23:27.406 --> 23:40.322
So you certainly have no anxiety about libraries tipping more towards... Well, I don't think I would use the word anxiety.

23:40.402 --> 23:51.315
I certainly have reservations and skepticisms, I think, just to... I mean, one obvious thing is the question of access.

23:51.435 --> 23:55.540
If you listen to people talk about digital libraries,

23:55.823 --> 24:20.717
often less informed people will say things like once all the books are digitized once everybody has a computer and so on and one of the things that working on a project like this will bring home to you very quickly is that there's the work is there's a lot more work that needs to be done than simply slapping the books down onto the scanner and having them

24:21.288 --> 24:26.396
somehow magically appear as digital text.

24:26.516 --> 24:29.661
The process is much more complicated than that.

24:29.681 --> 24:37.693
And when people talk about digitizing the holdings of the Library at Congress, I don't think it will ever happen.

24:37.834 --> 24:46.146
I was at the British Library in March, the new British Library, which cost about, you know, a billion pearls to build.

24:46.166 --> 24:48.510
And the director of the United States said, if we were to

24:49.317 --> 24:54.943
scan every page of every book we own, the price has been estimated at 50 billion pounds.

24:55.183 --> 24:58.086
So he says, trust me, that's never going to happen.

24:58.106 --> 25:01.109
And of course, labor is a price that's going to remain constant.

25:01.389 --> 25:05.353
The cost of the technology might go down a little bit.

25:05.814 --> 25:06.555
That'll happen.

25:06.615 --> 25:08.196
But labor is always going to be labor.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.139
So that is an expense.

25:12.641 --> 25:16.725
Did you tell me the subject of your thesis?

25:17.161 --> 25:22.188
I can actually show you a piece of it online in a moment.

25:23.510 --> 25:25.813
Let me just finish up here.

25:26.715 --> 25:33.544
You'll notice that after this bit of descriptive text that you get, there are these buttons marked iNote.

25:33.845 --> 25:39.693
iNote is a second Java envelope that was developed here at the Institute.

25:40.775 --> 25:44.400
What iNote will do for you after you run your image search

25:45.055 --> 26:13.881
is it will actually open the plate that the search has located and you'll notice that it is zoomed to the quadrant of the plate with the eagle and then in this window to the left you can view the editorial commentary on the plate so again and as i think i mentioned a while back what this does is it takes the images from being simply ornaments and illustrations that one can

26:14.080 --> 26:26.072
look at and they're very attractive, but you can't do anything more than look at them, and it integrates them into the archive in a functional way, in the same way that the text.

26:27.293 --> 26:31.738
Now, you are physically in the library, which you're not part of the library, right?

26:31.758 --> 26:32.659
You're not part of the library.

26:33.019 --> 26:33.480
That's right.

26:33.820 --> 26:38.324
I'm like the text center, which is a department of the library.

26:38.344 --> 26:41.007
The institute here is separate.

26:41.568 --> 26:42.889
So who do you work for?

26:43.274 --> 26:45.939
Who do I personally work for?

26:45.959 --> 26:50.066
I work for the project editors for the Institute.

26:51.189 --> 26:53.633
And is that an independent organization?

26:54.214 --> 27:03.752
Well, independent of the library, but we're funded by the provost's office here at UVA.

27:04.613 --> 27:06.717
The Institute is also funded from

27:07.439 --> 27:12.969
private donors from various grants and so on.

27:13.069 --> 27:20.181
The Blake Project, typically individual projects are funded by their own grant money.

27:20.201 --> 27:30.399
So as I said, the Blake Project right now is being funded by a grant from the Getty Art Institute.

27:30.419 --> 27:31.000
Let me see.

27:31.621 --> 27:45.739
But basically, I mean, I hope that that's gone some way towards answering your question about what we can do.

27:45.759 --> 27:54.490
I think now that we've met, if you don't mind, I can call you and get in touch with you, and maybe we can continue on.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.474
Sure.

27:56.054 --> 28:00.239
I'd be interested in seeing some of your writing on digital texts.

28:00.459 --> 28:19.601
Well, I've done none of that yet, but I've been to Cornell, and just in the last few years, there's been a tremendous explosion of work that's been published in this area on hypertext, digital text, digital libraries, and so on.

28:19.621 --> 28:20.882
So as somebody who

28:21.200 --> 28:31.916
is working as a scholar myself, writing critically about this field, I find that there's a lot more secondary material than one might expect.

28:32.076 --> 28:33.358
Well, what do you recommend?

28:33.438 --> 28:38.125
I go to this D.Live, let's say, that's pretty good.

28:38.145 --> 28:42.151
Yeah, D.Live is an electronic journal, I believe.

28:42.511 --> 28:49.201
And, well, the interesting thing about the medium is that you get people from all disciplines writing about it.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.042
You have

28:50.225 --> 29:01.788
people who are librarians, you also have literary scholars, you have people from art history, you have people who are specialists in media studies.

29:02.369 --> 29:06.698
So it's really, it's an interdisciplinary field.

29:07.387 --> 29:18.822
My suggestion to you as a researcher is that you're not confined to reading to any two library signs or to any one particular approach.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.265
So where would I find some of you?

29:21.285 --> 29:31.919
Well, you can, if you go to, for example, my dissertation site, I have a bibliography online.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.002
I can get this at the...

29:40.023 --> 29:41.245
Okay, I'll write it down.

29:41.325 --> 29:47.032
It'll be a while before you get to this tape, so I'll give you the address.

29:49.695 --> 29:52.639
So what do you hope to do?

29:53.100 --> 29:53.780
What's your future?

29:54.762 --> 30:07.718
I'd like to work on a university faculty, either in an English department or possibly a media studies department or a design program.

30:08.052 --> 30:10.416
Multimedia design, graphic design.

30:10.436 --> 30:13.080
Can you design this idea?

30:13.100 --> 30:13.321
Mm-hmm.

30:13.341 --> 30:17.107
If you, um... Are you what your course of study is?

30:17.868 --> 30:18.930
What's it called?

30:18.950 --> 30:22.877
It's Media and Contemporary Fiction.

30:22.937 --> 30:25.201
So it's E-N-T-L.

30:25.221 --> 30:32.473
W-W-W dot E-N-G-L dot Virginia.

30:36.098 --> 30:47.235
G-D-U, slash, and then that little curly thing, which you call it, what do you call that thing?

30:47.876 --> 30:49.519
That's a tilde.

30:49.799 --> 30:57.431
M-G-K, save that, three, and the number three, K, and it was, what's after the slash?

30:57.451 --> 31:00.115
On cited.html.

31:07.739 --> 31:23.668
And if you were to come into this address and simply drop the site at .html, you would find yourself at the homepage for the dissertation.

31:23.688 --> 31:32.143
In fact, let me, I'll write down the address for my personal address.

31:32.495 --> 31:53.597
interest in her is as somebody who is obviously deeply involved and invested with the printed word as such, but who thinks of her work with typography, with books, with printing, as being as a continuum of work developments.

31:53.617 --> 31:54.177
Where is she?

31:54.298 --> 31:55.118
Where is she?

31:55.138 --> 31:55.959
She's at Yale.

31:55.979 --> 32:00.544
She's an art historian.

32:01.351 --> 32:04.715
Just like somebody I want to talk to.

32:04.735 --> 32:08.901
And she's, I can find her, find her someplace to search?

32:08.921 --> 32:09.342
Yeah, and her book.

32:09.602 --> 32:14.248
She'll be, if you look, I dare not writing on the search column.

32:14.268 --> 32:19.275
You can find my interview with her.

32:22.219 --> 32:26.064
So she would actually have a perspective on it.

32:26.164 --> 32:30.750
An intellectual perspective on it.
