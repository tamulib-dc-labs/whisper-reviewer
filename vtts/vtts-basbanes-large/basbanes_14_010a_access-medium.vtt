00:02.225 --> 00:13.376
I'm not very used to this, and you might find it doesn't make much sense when you listen to it again.

00:14.938 --> 00:22.725
I suppose if you're digitizing the whole lot all at once by one method, the method itself goes out of date.

00:22.825 --> 00:27.490
You've got to re-digitize, transfer it from

00:27.706 --> 00:32.930
hypertext, supertext, or superhypertext, or postmodernist hypertext, whatever.

00:36.954 --> 00:41.157
You will find yourself having to redo the whole lot.

00:41.177 --> 00:41.618
That's right.

00:41.978 --> 00:49.244
And what they're also finding today is, we know the paper lasts a long time.

00:49.284 --> 00:50.625
Some paper lasts forever.

00:51.026 --> 00:53.168
Other paper doesn't.

00:53.688 --> 00:54.108
Exactly.

00:54.188 --> 00:57.291
Now we have, there's just a public broadcasting special

00:57.845 --> 01:05.214
in the United States, a lot of the data that has been retrieved from space and these missions to the planet, it's not even 10 years old.

01:06.096 --> 01:09.580
But it's preserved on magnetic tapes, which is already degrading.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.862
It's already inaccessible.

01:11.062 --> 01:13.665
Yes, magnetic tapes degrade very rapidly.

01:14.026 --> 01:17.510
I know that from having looked after an oral history collection once.

01:18.491 --> 01:26.822
And this was done in the primitive days of oral history, and some of it in little dictaphone reels from office tape recorders and that sort of thing.

01:27.275 --> 01:30.899
never re-recorded, and it was impossible to find the equipment to do it on.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.782
So the same happens electronically as well.

01:34.322 --> 01:44.532
Now if you, pardon me, but anyway, that's just kind of an introduction, but I know that your background also, you recently moved here to this facility.

01:44.552 --> 01:47.055
If you could tell us a little bit about your own background.

01:47.075 --> 01:51.579
I moved here from working for part of the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.181
I was there for 11 years.

01:53.718 --> 01:59.947
That was Rhodes House Library, the American and Commonwealth section, specializing in U.S.

01:59.987 --> 02:10.442
history and government, Commonwealth history and government, and in Commonwealth archives as well, because my own background was originally as an archivist rather than as a librarian.

02:11.483 --> 02:16.530
But I moved gradually into printed book work and... Interesting.

02:18.052 --> 02:22.138
Would you say that I also want to define a difference in this new book?

02:22.844 --> 02:25.588
the difference between an archivist and a librarian.

02:25.608 --> 02:36.682
How would you... Well, I was concerned with historic manuscript records, rather than with the current archives of an ongoing institution.

02:37.824 --> 02:51.602
And what we were looking after in Oxford were the papers of British colonial administrators all over the world, and several organizations that

02:52.308 --> 03:05.206
that have been concerned with either missionary, some with commercial, some with political life in the British colonial possessions.

03:06.107 --> 03:19.345
But before that I was in Edinburgh at the National Library of Scotland, and there I was looking after mainly 19th century documents, literary papers including Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Carlyle,

03:19.966 --> 03:21.769
Carlisle's been a theme throughout my life.

03:21.849 --> 03:48.589
I mean, looking after his papers there, the last thing I did when I left Edinburgh was to put on a Carlisle centenary exhibition to mark the centenary of his death, and found that at that stage I was looking at some of his correspondence about the foundation of the London Library without having any idea that I would end up looking after Carlisle's

03:51.185 --> 03:57.112
looking after the library, which looks to Carlisle as a founder.

03:57.132 --> 04:01.437
At the same time, I was interested in the origins of the Bloomsbury group.

04:01.638 --> 04:10.428
I wrote a book about, well edited, the unpublished autobiography of Leslie Stephen in the late 1970s.

04:11.189 --> 04:18.398
And that's come home to roost as well because Stephen was one of our most prominent 19th century presidents here at the London Library.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.280
So he's been another theme.

04:21.003 --> 04:24.829
throughout my life, linking to different institutions.

04:26.972 --> 04:31.700
We'll leave the matter of the Archivist, but there are certain missions.

04:31.780 --> 04:43.418
I mean, the Archivist is not so much concerned with provenance and matters of books and editions, but in terms of preservation and bringing all of these things together.

04:43.438 --> 04:45.762
There is a different attitude, I think, between

04:46.214 --> 04:49.117
What a librarian does, and what a librarian does.

04:49.137 --> 05:15.225
Yes, there's a different attitude, but I think at the research level that I was involved in it, the distinction wasn't as marked as it might be, say, in a local historical collection, that sort of thing, because we were dealing with the documents of major Scottish figures in Edinburgh.

05:15.712 --> 05:21.340
I never saw the distinction as marked as the two professions tend to feel.

05:21.841 --> 05:23.163
I think I totally agree.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.827
I'm treating them similarly.

05:25.927 --> 05:29.552
I mean, the mission is to gather, protect, and pass on.

05:31.014 --> 05:34.038
Last month I was at the Archive of the Indies in Seville.

05:34.299 --> 05:37.764
You were just mentioning colonial papers that you were dealing with.

05:37.784 --> 05:40.808
Is there a formal repository in the UK that...

05:41.108 --> 05:45.073
that gathers the British adventures abroad?

05:45.193 --> 05:47.535
Well, that was at Rhodes House, partly.

05:48.116 --> 05:56.005
There is the Public Record Office, the National Archives, dealing with the government of these territories.

05:56.626 --> 05:58.528
But this was about people who'd served there.

05:59.409 --> 06:10.542
And we'd rather split the responsibilities between the India Office Library, now part of the British Library, but previously part of the

06:11.686 --> 06:20.900
well, the India office itself, which then became part of the British Foreign Service Library.

06:21.201 --> 06:23.144
And that is now part of the British Library.

06:23.244 --> 06:27.410
It is the major source for the British experience of India.

06:28.432 --> 06:40.090
And from an African and other territories point of view, particularly strong in Africa, in the 1950s, with the winding down of empire and the

06:40.340 --> 07:02.651
forthcoming independence, they decided to systematically collect from former colonial service officials their own private papers, diaries, letters home, and other collections, to bring those together in Oxford.

07:03.593 --> 07:10.262
And I was the inheritor of this great effort, which was still continuing 30 years later.

07:11.187 --> 07:21.298
Of course, this particular institution is... there are institutions that aspire to be like it, but it is unique, I think we have to say.

07:21.578 --> 07:26.223
It's unique in the way it's developed, but in its origins it wasn't unique.

07:27.424 --> 07:30.588
It's very belated as a subscription library.

07:33.150 --> 07:39.557
When Thomas Carlyle came to London, was working on his big biography,

07:40.094 --> 07:46.061
and French Revolution, Frederick the Great, Cromwell book, particularly the Cromwell book.

07:46.721 --> 07:55.391
He was frustrated by the poor service he was getting from the then British Museum, collections of printed books.

07:55.411 --> 08:08.245
He couldn't get access to the books on the shelves, certainly couldn't borrow them, had difficulty getting adequate access to the catalogue, which wasn't at that stage the great printed catalogue that Finizzi put in.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.669
put into action.

08:11.770 --> 08:36.493
He was very frustrated by the service he was getting in Bloomsbury, where, of course, the round reading room hadn't been built, and he just didn't like the temperature, the other readers, the service he was getting from the... And he was somebody who was not one to let any grievances go untrumpeted.

08:37.148 --> 08:53.402
But he was sufficiently established in London literary life to be able to gather together a committee of literary people, sometimes with political.

08:53.462 --> 08:56.124
Gladstone was one of his early committee members.

08:56.625 --> 09:06.193
It was Educated London Society whom he brought together to try and establish a library of serious literature.

09:06.882 --> 09:14.792
of a sort that Carlisle had known in Scotland, in Edinburgh, but which existed already in many English provincial cities.

09:15.553 --> 09:19.018
And a considerable number of these libraries still continue this.

09:19.579 --> 09:30.934
The Leeds Library, the Portico Library in Manchester, the Literary and Philosophical Library in Newcastle-on-Tyne, which is, in the sense, my own formative library.

09:30.954 --> 09:32.856
It's one I used when I was a teenager.

09:33.173 --> 09:42.843
and then as a student at Cambridge, I used to go to Newcastle from my home nearby to use that, and that was established I think early 1820s.

09:42.923 --> 09:55.656
We are now the largest by far, in some ways the most prosperous, but we are the youngest of this.

09:56.857 --> 10:02.623
London itself didn't, until we were founded in 1841,

10:03.194 --> 10:08.863
have the same facilities.

10:09.904 --> 10:15.773
And we've developed from there the equivalents in the United States.

10:16.634 --> 10:31.176
And some of the remaining independent libraries are tiny, not quite as old as, say, the Redwood at Newport or the Providence Athenaeum, which continue in very different ways.

10:31.612 --> 10:33.815
I've visited them both and given talks there.

10:34.496 --> 10:37.901
But our real equivalent there, I suppose, is the Boston anthem there.

10:37.921 --> 10:39.443
I read it, the Boston anthem.

10:39.463 --> 10:39.683
Yes.

10:39.944 --> 10:44.230
Well, that is different from us in many ways.

10:44.390 --> 10:47.294
I mean, they've got much more splendid buildings.

10:47.334 --> 10:49.617
They've got works of art there.

10:50.238 --> 10:56.026
They've got historic collections of national importance.

10:56.086 --> 10:58.750
I mean, you know, the big section, segment of...

10:59.877 --> 11:01.218
of Washington's library.

11:01.879 --> 11:02.780
We don't have that.

11:03.661 --> 11:12.589
But their books tend to be in beautiful condition, however much the director despairs of their condition.

11:12.729 --> 11:19.856
I mean, here our own collections have been much more heavily used and are showing it, and that's one difference.

11:19.916 --> 11:22.138
But in spirit, we're rather the same.

11:22.859 --> 11:29.125
But to go back to Carlisle, in the 1840s, what he was after was a

11:30.522 --> 11:34.327
A library that would have serious literature, as he put it.

11:34.347 --> 11:43.580
I mean, that is not the same stock as the circulating libraries, which were essentially loan facilities for three-decker novels and for light literature.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.964
Here he was looking for more serious material.

11:48.286 --> 11:59.061
And it would build, it would accumulate a great store of serious knowledge, which would be accessible to readers,

11:59.783 --> 12:04.069
and in the sense of being browsable and borrowable.

12:05.090 --> 12:12.060
And these two aspects of the founder's wishes have been in our minds ever since.

12:12.861 --> 12:18.990
And although we've got round about a million volumes here, at least 90% of them are on open shelves.

12:19.050 --> 12:24.217
And they are arranged on a simple system.

12:24.257 --> 12:28.002
I come back to that in due course, which means that

12:28.420 --> 12:33.424
They're in broad subject groups, alphabetically arranged within those groups.

12:33.905 --> 12:38.869
And it's possible to do a great deal of what might be called associative browsing.

12:39.569 --> 12:40.891
You can actually go there.

12:40.931 --> 12:43.393
A lot of people don't use our subject catalogues.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.134
They prefer to look on the shelves.

12:45.615 --> 12:54.422
You go to a look, look for a simple book, a single book by an English author on a particular theme.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.005
You'll find alphabetically near it a French one.

12:58.222 --> 13:02.366
obviously more recent, more authoritative, that you perhaps didn't know existed.

13:02.826 --> 13:04.948
And that sort of browsing is very good.

13:06.009 --> 13:08.251
I'll continue with this, if you'd like.

13:08.271 --> 13:09.773
I like this.

13:11.174 --> 13:13.056
This is all part of the accessibility of it.

13:13.676 --> 13:20.883
Every now and again, we get some sort of PC trouble over, we've got a section called women, which comes between, as it were, wine and yachting.

13:20.903 --> 13:23.265
And people think this is demeaning in some way.

13:23.285 --> 13:26.608
Well, it's not.

13:27.466 --> 13:40.324
Once you see what's there, I mean, there's the whole of what the Victorians regarded as the woman question, I mean, works of John Stuart Mill, and it goes up to Susan Sontag and people like that, all in one alphabetical sequence.

13:40.424 --> 13:45.872
And the way you can do sort of mental cross-referencing, browsing there, is very good indeed.

13:46.433 --> 13:49.718
And that's, I mean, it's been kept up consistently over the years.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.141
Wine, for example, is not.

13:52.201 --> 13:56.427
I mean, we haven't collected systematically there, and of course wine

13:57.233 --> 14:01.719
is now a matter of scholarship rather than just of miscellaneous information.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.884
So, looking there, it's higgledy-piggledy.

14:04.904 --> 14:10.572
But under the women question, it's actually, historiographically, quite a major accumulation.

14:10.592 --> 14:14.417
And I think Carlyle would have approved of that, and I think his wife would, too.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.125
But that's one aspect of accessibility.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.570
That would be lost with the computer cataloging.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.194
No, it isn't.

14:26.444 --> 14:36.756
I mean, the ability to do associative browsing is going to be seriously... No, no, no, because this is the arrangement of books on the shelves, not the arrangement of books in the catalogue.

14:37.197 --> 14:44.906
So I think we're probably going to change to Library of Congress subject headings rather than our own local system, which has gone on for over a century.

14:45.426 --> 14:54.477
But it's much easier to browse by this international standard, looking up once you get to know the necessary keywords for searches.

14:55.722 --> 15:11.058
But the arrangement of books on the shelves, we'd like to change some of them, but some of these subject headings for the shelving of the books, we just don't have the room at the moment, because we're absolutely full.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.259
I'll come back to that later.

15:13.621 --> 15:21.989
But I'll just finish on accessibility, because the other thing is that we're a lending library.

15:22.009 --> 15:24.632
It has its disadvantages, as I mentioned when we first met,

15:25.102 --> 15:30.049
that you can't guarantee that the books are actually on the shelves.

15:30.790 --> 15:37.559
And if you're doing your browsing nearly by what you expect to find on the shelves, you're subject to a lot of disappointment.

15:38.300 --> 15:46.111
But we lend out our books in quite considerable periods, so long as people renew them.

15:46.131 --> 15:54.383
They could have them out, possibly for the duration of a biographical project or whatever, maybe the background reading essential for a historical

15:54.700 --> 15:56.041
novel or something like that.

15:57.102 --> 16:05.029
And with these liberal terms, members living in London, their basic subscription entitles them to 10 books at a time.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.711
Living in the country, it's 15 books at a time.

16:07.771 --> 16:19.361
And by paying a surcharge on the subscription, you can actually borrow, it gets progressively more expensive, but you can actually borrow up 40 books at a time and have them out for long periods.

16:20.102 --> 16:23.965
People do get possessive of them or they get onto their own shelves and it's difficult to

16:24.248 --> 16:26.872
extricate them from the more adhesive sort of members.

16:27.373 --> 16:40.453
But this liberal lending policy is very good for the encouragement of research or in-depth reading.

16:41.554 --> 16:50.408
Not necessarily that by which I mean reading in depth and not geared by the requirements of either academic research

16:50.810 --> 16:53.533
for degrees or for actual publications.

16:53.593 --> 16:55.355
We've got a lot of writing members as well.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.157
We've got a lot of writing members.

16:57.177 --> 16:58.819
We've got even more reading members.

17:00.160 --> 17:17.619
But the corollary of this liberal lending policy is that we rely on members to return books immediately after the initial lending period is over if somebody else wants it.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.142
And we like to have those books back very quickly.

17:20.662 --> 17:22.544
So we've got the sort of honor system.

17:22.605 --> 17:47.597
It's very difficult to compel in that way, but as I well know, because I think the difficult cases when books get stuck with one member and another is paying for them, they end up on the librarian's desk and some difficult telephone calls have to be made or letters awkward to write have to be sent.

17:48.725 --> 17:57.176
So that is how we are operating in the Carlisleian way of offering good browsing and good borrowing.

17:58.197 --> 18:15.959
And there's also now the possibility, the probability, in the next few months, we've at last got the electronic infrastructure in place so that we can allow our readers to do online searches of our own, the modern parts of our catalogue.

18:15.979 --> 18:17.601
That's from 1984 onwards.

18:18.222 --> 18:36.068
And I'm pretty sure that Carlisle himself, had he known of this, would have been one of the very first to get a modem in Cheney Row for his own little study there.

18:38.071 --> 18:42.257
Do we have little rooms for writers to... We don't.

18:42.738 --> 18:45.302
As you'll see, we've only got the main reading room.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.605
There are reading tables.

18:48.226 --> 18:51.931
working tables in the book stacks in various places.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.933
Some people read there.

18:54.954 --> 19:00.801
A lot of people just seem to squat on the floor and get all their references together.

19:01.322 --> 19:15.719
But the reading room itself, as you will see, it's got about 20 tables for a single or a couple of people at them, and it can get very busy.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.001
A lot of our

19:17.335 --> 19:27.387
Well, there are a noticeable number of people in that reading room who come here very regularly, sometimes daily, and do their writing there.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.949
They regard it, in a way, as their writing office.

19:30.810 --> 19:44.406
I'm not going to be naming particular names, but, you know, there are... I can think of two novelists who had different careers, academic careers, who actually came here and wrote their fictional works.

19:44.892 --> 19:55.726
works of fiction, in the reading room, because it was so different from working in their faculty office or their university library.

19:56.027 --> 19:59.892
And these people who were still actively writing?

19:59.952 --> 20:01.534
Yes, actively writing.

20:01.594 --> 20:13.330
And so they used this as an alternative place, because we look like a club in various ways, as the Athenaeum does in Boston, but we are not a club.

20:13.732 --> 20:20.940
We don't have any social facilities at all, we don't, unlike the Ateneum in Boston, we don't give lectures there.

20:22.281 --> 20:38.980
We've got no coffee room, and so it is, there's an ancient notice in the reading room just saying silence is requested, and that's normally obeyed.

20:40.445 --> 20:43.569
You can guarantee that you're not going to be disturbed there.

20:44.310 --> 21:02.976
So, you know, literary people with obviously prominent figures can actually come to the library and nobody's going to disturb them and bother them about what's their next book, how much they enjoyed the last one.

21:03.192 --> 21:07.958
And don't you think you should be writing about such an interesting subject?

21:08.259 --> 21:09.821
They can get away from that.

21:09.861 --> 21:10.662
That's not going to happen.

21:10.682 --> 21:11.824
That's not going to happen here.

21:12.825 --> 21:16.310
We don't have an education program.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.394
We've got one lecture a year, which is quite an innovation.

21:20.295 --> 21:29.908
In our 150th anniversary year, 1991, before I was here, we had a series of lectures about the history of the library.

21:31.306 --> 21:33.869
They were very well attended and we thought this was a good idea.

21:33.889 --> 21:44.464
So each year we have a single lecture which is attended by anything between about five and seven hundred people.

21:44.764 --> 21:55.879
We have to take one of the largest lecture halls in London which is at the Royal Geographical Society and we can fill it with over seven hundred.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.322
What is the size of the membership?

21:59.983 --> 22:07.370
The membership is now, it seems to have come out at a plateau of between eight and eight and a half thousand.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.192
Slight fluctuations in that.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.896
It's growing at the moment by about ten or twelve a month.

22:13.797 --> 22:15.558
So it's a very gradual growth.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.300
We don't need to advertise.

22:18.121 --> 22:25.208
We've got a form of application which has on it

22:25.947 --> 22:46.355
You've got to provide a reference, we've got to satisfy ourselves of people's bona fides, but we're very much open in that way because we are a recognised charity and it would impair our charitable status if we were asking people to be proposed and seconded as if we were a social club.

22:46.655 --> 22:54.486
But we've got to satisfy ourselves about bona fides and so we ask for a reference which should be of somebody of

22:55.175 --> 23:00.520
pompous phrase that I devised myself of readily verifiable standing.

23:01.461 --> 23:15.014
And this is because, you know, we practically, oh, I think it's about 80% of those who join the library do so on the recommendation of existing members of the library.

23:15.474 --> 23:17.516
So we're spread by word of mouth in that way.

23:17.576 --> 23:18.617
We're not advertising.

23:19.478 --> 23:24.743
And, of course, the...

23:25.212 --> 23:46.320
We've grown in that way, and the membership used 30 years ago to be about 5,000, and then it was in danger of becoming 7,500, and people thought the reading room was going to be crowded and it would overload us in various ways.

23:47.121 --> 23:53.329
They never all come at once, of course, but on the other hand it would just mean that there were more people about.

23:54.828 --> 23:57.812
much more use of the library.

23:58.393 --> 24:03.640
So they, for a very short time, put up a waiting list.

24:03.700 --> 24:23.367
You had to, you know, they capped the membership at 7,500, and that was pretty disastrous because a lot of dormant members, you know, who just paid their subscription, didn't use as much, wrote in very guiltily and said, I didn't realise I was keeping out for a student and that sort of thing, I must resign immediately.

24:23.532 --> 24:26.376
And so the figures dropped and sort of stabilized at that.

24:26.796 --> 24:33.866
But there's been a sort of legend ever since for the last 15 years or so that we have a waiting list and we're exclusive in that way.

24:34.327 --> 24:38.052
But it's possible to join within a week of application, possibly shorter.

24:39.053 --> 24:45.422
And that's been something that we've

24:46.938 --> 24:48.280
Continued very nicely.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.584
We can't really analyze the people who are coming in.

24:51.904 --> 25:00.214
I've looked through, and that entire wall in my office is the application forms going back to the 1870s.

25:00.434 --> 25:02.757
And I've sampled these at different times.

25:03.638 --> 25:06.161
And it's awfully difficult to work out.

25:06.181 --> 25:09.725
I mean, these go back to the time where it says profession, and people put down spinster.

25:10.686 --> 25:16.253
But now, people will put themselves down not

25:16.537 --> 25:26.849
as sort of researcher or writer or author when they haven't written or at least haven't published anything.

25:27.429 --> 25:29.492
And what they're really interested in is reading.

25:30.112 --> 25:35.298
And what I would like to do is find out the number of people who rely on us for reading.

25:36.700 --> 25:40.524
Reading for pleasure, reading for information, rather than for writing.

25:40.644 --> 25:43.047
And that's quite a distinction to make.

25:43.087 --> 25:45.970
And it's almost impossible to work out from our

25:46.355 --> 25:46.936
Membership.

25:48.097 --> 25:48.697
Applications.

25:48.738 --> 25:52.622
I'm going to have a chapter in my book on reading, so that is... Yes.

25:52.742 --> 25:52.942
Yes.

25:52.962 --> 25:57.186
You must have some pretty extraordinary... Those are the original applications?

25:57.206 --> 25:58.328
These are the original applications.

25:58.508 --> 26:01.671
So wouldn't you expect to see Virginia Woolf in here someplace?

26:01.691 --> 26:03.233
You'd find Virginia Woolf.

26:04.074 --> 26:14.725
Anybody would have, picking it up and knowing something about British social and literary life in the last century and a half, you would...

26:15.616 --> 26:19.702
you'd be able to find something resonant, you know, just turning the pages.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.865
Do you mind if I take a photograph of that wall?

26:22.446 --> 26:24.229
You could, yes.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.451
It's pretty messy at the moment.

26:25.471 --> 26:34.905
Oh, I like it, actually.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.488
One of your members is fearful that you might be moving.

26:38.029 --> 26:43.277
No, we took the decision to remain on this site.

26:43.797 --> 26:57.653
The door you came in by is in a narrow facade, which was the site of an 18th century nobleman's run-down townhouse.

26:58.774 --> 27:12.049
And they extended all the way to Duke Street, to the west, into Mason's Yard, the Meuse at the north.

27:12.417 --> 27:14.560
by buying up little plots here and there.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.904
And the great thing about this site is that it is freehold.

27:18.445 --> 27:23.852
We're not subject to getting out at the end of some enormously long lease of 999 years.

27:25.935 --> 27:29.480
We actually own the site we're on.

27:29.760 --> 27:34.827
And the site itself, were we to move, would be very valuable.

27:35.288 --> 27:39.353
But as we are a listed building, there are all sorts of planning restrictions on

27:39.839 --> 27:49.470
developing the site, and parts of the building, including the original iron frame book stacks, are specially listed.

27:49.510 --> 27:56.537
So it's almost impossible to convert it for any other use, even though it could become a big corporate headquarters like our neighbours.

27:56.637 --> 28:07.129
And we've got a private bank, the private banking service of the Australia and New Zealand bank on one side, and the headquarters of the clerical medical insurance company on the other.

28:07.717 --> 28:21.976
And we're on good terms with them, but it's improbable, ultimately not impossible that they might move, but it would be very difficult for us to afford to buy the huge buildings on either side.

28:21.996 --> 28:22.978
So it does preclude them.

28:22.998 --> 28:31.689
And you also said that you're full, you have a million books and you have no books, so what's the... Well, we have some spaces, but we have no space.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.572
If I can put it like that, I mean, there are gaps.

28:33.991 --> 28:37.856
which in certain sections will allow for the expansion of the collections.

28:38.376 --> 28:50.110
But they're in a sense in the wrong places because there are some grossly congested parts which are already full.

28:50.170 --> 29:00.623
And at the time we were able to expand by putting on additional book stacks on the perimeter of the building because unfortunately we can't, as you'll see when we go around, we can't actually

29:00.957 --> 29:26.847
Expand upwards in the core of it and there are there's a light well in the middle here actually in the lowest part of it at the moment which That light well and if we filled it we would impair the Rights to light of a big apartment block to them to the west and it would be awfully difficult because we'd have to drive piles through our main book stack to support any further floors and

29:27.080 --> 29:37.340
So we put the whole thing out of action, the whole library, or the core of the library, out of action for probably two years or so, and it would be almost impossible to continue our services in that way.

29:37.821 --> 29:41.348
Now in Boston at the Athenaeum, they have acquired an adjoining building.

29:41.568 --> 29:41.889
Oh, yes.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.457
I'll tell you, when your machine's off, I'll tell you one of Rodney Armstrong's stories about that.

29:46.538 --> 29:47.900
I'd love to hear that.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.864
But that's the sort of thing where, you know,

29:50.013 --> 30:08.123
It happened at the Morgan Library as well, where they had the headquarters of the Lutheran Church in the corner, good neighbors who unexpectedly decided to move off to somewhere like Scranton, New Jersey, and leaving this building, which they hoped for.

30:08.693 --> 30:10.074
remotely.

30:10.094 --> 30:14.699
It was, you know, a pipe dream except that you can't smoke in the morgue, I might remember.

30:15.359 --> 30:23.047
And were able to, you know, they were able to raise the money, and about twice as much money in half the time they allowed themselves to do so.

30:23.887 --> 30:26.290
So something like that might happen here one day.

30:27.991 --> 30:35.038
But even so, I think we're finding that the overcrowded parts of this institution where

30:35.845 --> 30:39.030
Shelves have books lying horizontal on top.

30:39.951 --> 30:46.361
So it means that some sections are not 100% full, they're actually 110% full because of these extra books.

30:47.723 --> 30:54.474
It's concentrating our mind on the necessity of some sort of stock control, deaccessioning material.

30:55.015 --> 30:59.141
That is not losing titles, but sometimes losing superfluous copies.

30:59.922 --> 31:01.144
Because over the years,

31:02.795 --> 31:05.758
volumes particularly in demand have been duplicated.

31:05.798 --> 31:27.482
That demand has gone, and if we've got three sets of the two-volume biography of a Victorian bishop, say, which was of interest in all sorts of ways when it was published and afterwards, is now of particular interest only to ecclesiastical historians.

31:27.642 --> 31:31.907
We can manage quite well with, if we've got three sets, we can manage easily with two.

31:32.292 --> 31:33.373
probably with one.

31:34.514 --> 32:00.780
And so reducing that in that way is an expensive job because it requires high knowledge or high professional, no, it requires the discrimination and judgment of very senior staff because there are all sorts of exceptions to this rule.

32:01.469 --> 32:05.034
so that not every duplicate could be disposed of.

32:05.594 --> 32:08.097
And there's a very good case for continuing.

32:09.099 --> 32:15.747
And multiple editions of out-of-date works of popular science, for example.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.991
These are samples that we've come across recently.

32:19.632 --> 32:29.164
Out-of-date legal encyclopedias, which might have some sort of research interest in a specialist law library.

32:29.768 --> 32:36.575
There's no point in our keeping three and a half shelves full of an out-of-date specialist encyclopedia.

32:37.356 --> 32:51.469
There would be for this, say, the Britannica, where we've got many older editions because the treatment of the subject in a general encyclopedia is a matter of considerable interest the way it developed.

32:52.230 --> 32:59.117
So with these in mind, we are about to start a discreet

33:00.852 --> 33:01.873
stock audit.

33:04.055 --> 33:04.676
Stock audit.

33:05.016 --> 33:05.656
Stock audit.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.939
How would you spell it?

33:08.099 --> 33:09.040
S-T-O-C-K.

33:09.300 --> 33:10.521
Of the book stock.

33:12.543 --> 33:20.390
Just assessing it with a view to pruning it and reducing the... Pruning it is the word they use at Harvard.

33:20.410 --> 33:22.012
They don't like to say they weed.

33:22.152 --> 33:22.572
No, no.

33:22.672 --> 33:29.779
Audit is a term that... Weeding suggests you're actually eradicating certain things.

33:30.282 --> 33:56.863
What we want to do, as I said, I don't intend to lose any title, but we would like to take out superfluous copies, and I've been walking around the stacks with one of my very senior colleagues who is in charge of the circulation section, the reader services bit of the issues and returns of books, and has a very good sense of

33:58.160 --> 33:59.923
what is really wanted.

34:00.023 --> 34:05.391
And we went around, we spent a lot of time together there, and have come to much the same conclusion.

34:07.895 --> 34:17.310
So there is no threat here of deaccessioning a book, even though it perhaps has not been read in 50 years.

34:17.791 --> 34:18.011
No.

34:18.452 --> 34:24.842
Well, we can monitor this in various ways, because 25 years ago,

34:25.345 --> 34:32.636
we started using a different sort of issue label and putting a date stamped adhesive label in the front of the books.

34:33.577 --> 34:41.268
It is amazing how many older books that we can guarantee, because they don't have this label, go out each week.

34:42.310 --> 34:48.619
They're probably putting a fresh label into a book that hasn't been out for 25 years.

34:49.510 --> 34:53.195
Is this just a separate track and see how many of them are used?

34:53.296 --> 34:54.958
Well, we can do this.

34:54.998 --> 35:02.329
I can't remember what the figures are, but there will certainly be 20 or 30 books a week that haven't been used in a considerable period of time.

35:02.349 --> 35:04.092
Yes, and are now going out.

35:04.492 --> 35:07.076
And there are sections that have been dormant for a long time.

35:07.096 --> 35:18.353
I mean, we've had a good deal of serious fiction, and we've got a good fiction section, huge in English, but also

35:19.413 --> 35:21.896
French, German, Russian, etc.

35:21.916 --> 35:24.139
I can come on to the Foreigner Collections later if you'd like.

35:24.881 --> 35:37.057
But late 19th century fiction has, except for the major authors, has been pretty much in the doldrums as a subject of academic study until about ten years ago.

35:37.117 --> 35:45.769
Now we're getting a lot of applications from people doing master's degrees at newer universities which don't have large libraries.

35:45.829 --> 35:48.593
And if they've got large libraries are not well stocked in

35:48.758 --> 35:52.603
late 19th century women's fiction, which is one of the great boom subjects.

35:53.524 --> 36:13.710
There are booms in things like gay studies or whatever where we've found ourselves surprisingly well equipped without having a section dealing with gay homosexual literature.

36:14.110 --> 36:16.133
But we've

36:16.501 --> 36:29.297
Here, with the late 19th century women authors, we've probably got one of the finest collection, probably the finest lending collection of this material in the entire country.

36:29.678 --> 36:38.368
So people are joining us because it's a subject that universities are anxious to teach and encourage, but they don't have the bibliographical facilities for.

36:38.689 --> 36:42.053
So you've almost become a research-depth facility.

36:42.843 --> 36:43.684
But not even trying.

36:43.704 --> 36:44.405
That's right, yes.

36:44.465 --> 36:46.328
Without trying to do it.

36:46.388 --> 36:49.412
Trying to do your job with just a comprehensive collection.

36:49.432 --> 36:50.373
That's right, yes, oh yes.

36:50.393 --> 36:56.000
And the fact that you don't deaccession material, as so many other libraries are doing.

36:56.041 --> 36:56.281
Yes.

36:56.802 --> 37:01.508
Well, we did, I think in the 1920s, they thinned out the fiction collection.

37:02.209 --> 37:03.851
And I don't know what went then.

37:05.093 --> 37:07.035
Because a lot of our records were lost during the war.

37:07.496 --> 37:10.059
It would be very interesting to know what we had lost then.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.242
And that is why I'm...

37:12.998 --> 37:30.542
I'm very anxious to maintain at least one copy of each title we've had, to perhaps reduce the amount of duplication, because it's amazing what people will want.

37:31.664 --> 37:38.533
However strange it may seem, however dull this stuff is, but there are certain other sections where

37:40.184 --> 37:52.780
We do have material that isn't really appropriate here, because since we were established, other major facilities now exist.

37:54.002 --> 38:05.837
And one would, at research level, would go to, rather than casual reading level, one would go for them for this sort of material.

38:06.593 --> 38:20.207
agricultural cooperation statistics and that sort of thing, where we've got, somebody has given us various statistical annuals, but we've only got a very short run of them.

38:20.227 --> 38:34.761
If you're going to be doing that sort of subject historically, you've got to look at a complete run of those, and there are agricultural, institutes specializing in agricultural historical statistics, where you can get a complete run of it.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.509
And so there are some subjects like that.

38:37.589 --> 38:54.914
But mainstream literature, mainstream history, art history, etc., we've got collections of great strength, which, as you say, have grown to an in-depth research level.

38:55.134 --> 38:58.639
Do you see yourself as a research library?

38:58.939 --> 39:00.601
Well, a library that provides for research.

39:00.762 --> 39:03.145
We don't have the big...

39:05.892 --> 39:09.036
the great in-depth special collection.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.758
We've got very few special collections.

39:11.099 --> 39:19.630
We've had one of the oddities we've got is a large collection of... Can I take your photograph, by the way?

39:19.770 --> 39:22.233
Do you have any?

39:22.253 --> 39:22.573
Yes.

39:23.114 --> 39:24.075
Well, I don't know.

39:24.376 --> 39:25.317
By which I mean no.

39:26.358 --> 39:28.321
Just be casual.

39:28.341 --> 39:30.063
You'll be surprised if I take a picture.

39:30.323 --> 39:35.730
I'll carry on talking about this because it's whatever it was.

39:35.997 --> 39:36.698
Tell me.

39:38.600 --> 39:46.627
The only large special collection we've got is to do with the history of fox hunting.

39:47.749 --> 39:49.310
And it was given to us in the 1950s.

39:49.430 --> 39:54.896
It's obviously, at the moment, especially in England at present, it's a very sensitive subject.

39:55.556 --> 40:04.485
But it is so rich, and it's, I guess, about 3,000 volumes.

40:04.938 --> 40:08.764
periodicals, serials of various kinds.

40:09.224 --> 40:27.491
It's used a great deal by obviously hunting enthusiasts, but it's been used twice in the last 20 years by the two major historians of English fox hunting, Raymond Carr.

40:28.192 --> 40:31.958
Carr did this as a hobby

40:32.798 --> 40:35.581
He's one of the great historians of modern Spain.

40:36.242 --> 40:40.587
But Mr. Oxford Don, he used our collection as the basis for his book.

40:41.267 --> 40:48.395
And Jane Ridley's Social History of English Foxhunting has also been researched there.

40:48.575 --> 41:01.810
And so, you know, there's also a sort of bibliophilic collection of different editions of Omar Khayyar, which is not a particular

41:03.646 --> 41:31.105
importance relevance etc i don't think it's been consulted in years but though i think a fitzgerald scholar might find something there it is you know it's more private collectors thing and um you know the the textual history of the textual evolution of the poem is all settled it's just a number of variant copies illustrating uh well i think it's a frankly illustrating the rather bad taste in which it was printed over the years

41:31.237 --> 41:34.583
Could you tell us something about your collection policy, your acquisitions policy?

41:34.643 --> 41:36.185
Do you have guidelines that you follow?

41:36.205 --> 41:57.160
I think, you know, developing from what you were saying about having become an in-depth research library in spite of general intentions, bearing that in mind, I think we're building on strength, which is...

41:57.460 --> 42:13.263
Look, trying to get a good sense of what we've had in the past and working from there in our various strong subject areas.

42:14.164 --> 42:22.156
Much of the English language acquisitions are done from this office.

42:23.297 --> 42:24.599
That is a selection.

42:24.619 --> 42:25.240
There's an ordering.

42:25.895 --> 42:32.544
There's an ordering department as well, we'll see to it, but booksellers' catalogues are marked up in this time for them.

42:33.445 --> 42:42.376
And we've also got, especially among the cataloguers, we've got language specialists.

42:43.338 --> 42:55.834
And historically, because there were two librarians in the 19th century, both of whom had Russian interests, we've got very strong collections in classical Russian literature.

42:57.417 --> 43:04.185
which have been continued over the years, and very fine collections they are.

43:04.205 --> 43:12.415
I mean, there's great tributes to them from Isaiah Berlin, who was a young man, discovered Alexander Hudson here.

43:13.196 --> 43:25.450
He was looking for a subject when he just became a research fellow at Oxford College, joined us, and just browsing, discovered Hudson, who became one of the

43:26.341 --> 43:30.385
great points of illumination in that distinguished intellectual life.

43:31.666 --> 43:35.850
And so we keep that up.

43:36.271 --> 43:42.477
We've got big French, particularly German, Spanish, Italian, et cetera.

43:43.658 --> 43:54.588
One of my most distinguished predecessors, Sir Charles Hagberg Wright, was the Hagberg bit of his name was actually Swedish.

43:55.309 --> 43:56.230
His mother was

43:56.564 --> 44:01.494
And as a result, you know, for a certain period, we've got rather good Scandinavian collections.

44:01.954 --> 44:04.760
But we don't pursue those in their original language anymore.

44:05.521 --> 44:08.046
But we'll always be looking for translations.

44:09.249 --> 44:17.144
And I recently had a visit from a Danish librarian who was very impressed by what we've got.

44:18.326 --> 44:19.348
I'm sorry.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.459
Roughly how many volumes would you say you require a year?

44:22.479 --> 44:25.303
Do you have a dedicated budget for that?

44:25.343 --> 44:30.270
We've got a dedicated budget, which isn't the same as our expenditure.

44:30.390 --> 44:31.872
I've come to that.

44:33.714 --> 44:39.322
But the number of volumes is round about 7,000 a year, including bound periodicals and that sort of thing.

44:40.524 --> 44:41.986
Some of these come by donation.

44:42.266 --> 44:43.968
Authors give us their own books.

44:44.609 --> 44:47.293
Some by bequest, though we try to be

44:47.881 --> 44:53.227
make arrangements in advance, sort of pre-need arrangements, as they call it at Forest Lawn.

44:57.231 --> 44:59.073
We can talk to people.

44:59.093 --> 45:10.485
What we don't want is people leaving us entire libraries, because well-read libraries of lovers of English literature tend to be very much the same, and of course they're the sort of books we've got already.

45:11.066 --> 45:16.892
So it's best to find out what sort of things people are offering to

45:19.657 --> 45:34.060
stress our particular needs and also to get permission to dispose of unwanted material, which has never been stamped with the library's marks, but we can actually dispose of that for the benefit of the library.

45:35.763 --> 45:45.799
But because of our special position in British literary life in the widest sense, not just

45:48.125 --> 45:49.586
in a London way.

45:49.626 --> 45:53.430
I'd better say something a bit later about the fact that we're not just London Library.

45:53.450 --> 46:01.217
We've got about a quarter of our membership are country members for whom there's a parcel post service.

46:01.597 --> 46:03.599
How about members outside of the UK?

46:03.979 --> 46:15.550
Well, we've got a few outside the UK, but the members' duty to return books on request and to get them back to us speedily obviously means we don't have

46:16.289 --> 46:17.951
people in the USA.

46:17.971 --> 46:20.954
We've got a number of American members, but they tend to be... Friends.

46:21.215 --> 46:22.656
We must have a friends group.

46:22.676 --> 46:22.997
We don't.

46:23.077 --> 46:24.839
I mean, all members are friends in that way.

46:24.859 --> 46:28.002
Well, you don't have friends, which provides some support.

46:28.082 --> 46:36.212
Yes, we've got some financial support through a little body called the International Friends of the London Library, which is recognized as tax-efficient in New York.

46:36.852 --> 46:40.997
But with the...

46:41.888 --> 46:43.129
I'm getting rather confused now.

46:43.149 --> 46:44.630
I've been talking too quickly too long.

46:45.711 --> 46:46.852
Yes.

46:51.136 --> 47:00.504
Before I was talking about... I got rather diverted into that membership.

47:00.544 --> 47:00.885
Yes, right.

47:01.065 --> 47:01.805
I'll get back to it.

47:03.207 --> 47:11.794
Because we are recognised by publishers, and particularly the Publishers' Association, as having a special role in

47:12.179 --> 47:26.996
In British literary life, I mean, from the writing of books through the production of them, editorial, where a great deal of many publishers belong to us as corporate members and use us as their reference library.

47:27.677 --> 47:35.346
And a lot of editorial work, which is increasingly, as in the United States, farmed out to private practitioners.

47:35.667 --> 47:40.212
People don't have actually desks in publishing offices, but will do consultant editorial work.

47:40.934 --> 47:47.480
We've got a continuing role there, everything from the actual creative process to the reviewing process.

47:48.361 --> 48:10.823
And because of this, there is a concession of very, very longstanding, last renewed, I think, in 1952, and I've never, in favorable terms that I've never sought to query, that we are entitled to, oh, no, publishers may offer us

48:11.495 --> 48:30.404
trade terms rather than library terms so that we can actually get discounts of 25, 30% rather than the 10% which until the abolition of retail price maintenance for books was absolutely standard.

48:30.424 --> 48:33.889
It was called the library license, this 10% reduction.

48:33.929 --> 48:39.898
So we're getting an extra 10 or 15%, possibly 20% more

48:40.334 --> 48:49.267
So the amount we spend on our books as the monographs, not our periodicals, is subject to this generous concession.

48:49.848 --> 48:51.510
So we're getting more for our money.

48:52.492 --> 48:55.456
And for the British publications, that is.

48:56.598 --> 48:57.840
And very satisfactory it is.

48:57.880 --> 49:02.747
And it means that the annual budget stretches a little further as a result.

49:03.115 --> 49:05.438
Now you're talking about people who give books.

49:05.658 --> 49:08.282
You aren't necessarily looking for a rare book collection.

49:08.522 --> 49:16.934
No, but of course we've acquired rare books over the years, and many of them have been incorporated into the main series.

49:16.974 --> 49:22.762
And of course, after 150 years running, there are books that have become rare over the years.

49:23.663 --> 49:25.085
And this leads to some difficulties.

49:25.185 --> 49:31.654
I mean, it's possible here still to borrow, say, Trollope First Editions to read.

49:32.393 --> 49:36.357
Now, we lend them out now.

49:36.377 --> 49:45.627
You've got a sign as a guarantee form, recognizing that they have a special value, a replacement value, and that they are rare and costly works.

49:47.088 --> 49:52.274
In fact, these are books that have been rebound two, possibly three times.

49:52.834 --> 49:58.160
To a collector, they have no commercial value at all.

50:00.002 --> 50:02.164
To a scholar, they have a value as

50:02.363 --> 50:09.732
a text as an original text, but by no means in its original condition.

50:10.694 --> 50:20.406
Impossible to find books in this condition now, like that, to get an exact replacement for four times rebound, copy of Family Parsonage, or something like that.

50:21.027 --> 50:31.240
So if somebody loses it, they will have to replace it with one in collector's condition, which is probably going to cost

50:31.422 --> 50:38.610
six or seven hundred pounds, so maybe more now, because of yet another trial of revival.

50:39.371 --> 50:45.818
So it means that we've got to be very careful about our stock in that way, and we're gradually going through it.

50:45.838 --> 51:00.754
The rare books collection is being moved from a unventilated basement store with secure doors, but not good environment, to

51:01.409 --> 51:08.278
a building that we call our Amstruther wing, which is Ian Amstruther, our generous member donor.

51:09.160 --> 51:20.956
And we've got a series of small environmentally improved strong rooms there with mobile shelving.

51:21.717 --> 51:23.199
And we're gradually filling that up.

51:23.219 --> 51:29.948
But it's a slow process moving from the basement in this building to remote parts of the site.

51:30.367 --> 51:31.849
But it's working well.

51:32.910 --> 51:33.892
We've got to clean the books.

51:34.833 --> 51:38.458
We've got to list them while they're shipped from one end to the other.

51:38.658 --> 51:43.906
So we do some basic listing and a cleaning process for which we've got a team of trained volunteers.

51:44.026 --> 52:00.188
Not our own members, but a team of fine arts and fine and decorative art volunteers who... It's a major scheme for quite often retired people who want to do something useful in a cultural way.

52:00.505 --> 52:05.792
They do tapestries in National Trust houses, and there's a small group of them who do books.

52:06.312 --> 52:07.974
So they're working on this at the moment.

52:08.715 --> 52:16.365
And it's a slow process, but we're getting our books repaired, minor repairs, and cleaned on the way.

52:16.625 --> 52:18.968
We're talking about repairs to bindings, etc.

52:19.008 --> 52:25.156
But now, the history of this institution just coincidentally passes through the period, the brittle book period.

52:25.817 --> 52:29.702
Yes, well, what's downstairs are books that are...

52:32.062 --> 52:35.886
mainly books that are valuable because of age.

52:36.927 --> 52:42.573
And so the paper problem is not as acute as it is for the later ones.

52:42.653 --> 52:44.455
Do you do any deacidification?

52:44.475 --> 52:45.556
No, we're not at the moment.

52:45.736 --> 52:50.602
I mean, but we do have books in aesthetically awful condition.

52:52.944 --> 53:00.432
We tend to use surrogate copies, and sometimes we will have the whole thing

53:01.998 --> 53:11.266
Xeroxed and a single electrostatic copy of it done by a bookbinder who specializes in this.

53:11.887 --> 53:21.416
That process understood to be destroying the original, which may not be particularly valuable.

53:23.578 --> 53:27.201
But we fail to find a copy.

53:27.501 --> 53:31.465
And of course, if we do find a copy, it is going to be in similar

53:31.917 --> 53:35.242
poor condition, because the paper will have decayed.

53:36.283 --> 53:51.585
Or it may not look as brown, but it's certainly chemically as brittle as it would have been as our own derelict copy already is.

53:52.907 --> 54:00.017
But I don't think the problem isn't quite as apparent as it is with the temperature extremes of the

54:00.318 --> 54:08.649
East Coast United States, and the particularly poor quality of late 19th century American paper.

54:10.291 --> 54:19.823
I think the amount of pollutants in the wood pulp is just much more than it was in British.

54:19.843 --> 54:23.828
I mean, this is my old experience of looking at

54:24.601 --> 54:53.730
all the American imprints of Carlisle at one stage when I was working in the National Library of Scotland and finding just how extremely brown, cigar-like, the early Boston editions of Carlisle's works were compared with the ones that had been read much more in the main collections in Edinburgh.

54:55.094 --> 54:57.457
Did you have any questions for us?

54:57.477 --> 54:58.960
This is really wonderful.

54:58.980 --> 55:04.728
You know, we were talking about books becoming rare just by the circumstance of acquiring them when they're issued.

55:04.968 --> 55:13.961
At the FNAF, they have a full set of Audubon's Birds of America acquired when it was issued in 18.

55:14.242 --> 55:15.784
Now it's worth several million dollars.

55:15.804 --> 55:16.224
Indeed.

55:16.325 --> 55:18.047
They've got one, too.

55:18.314 --> 55:20.277
at the Providence Avenue.

55:20.377 --> 55:21.399
I believe they do, yes.

55:21.519 --> 55:23.001
Which, you know, dominates.

55:23.702 --> 55:28.870
They've got a rare book room, which is smaller than this, and it has a table in somebody's office in it.

55:28.910 --> 55:38.704
But, I mean, what they do have there is the most enormous cradle, so that they can get their eau de bois out and show it.

55:38.785 --> 55:43.331
I mean, but that, you know, so that, in a sense, could be dominated by that book.

55:43.431 --> 55:46.316
In fact, it's become a minor part of their activities.

55:46.376 --> 55:47.157
They've got...

55:47.575 --> 55:51.358
you know, good general collections, and they're a community library in various ways.

55:51.959 --> 55:53.440
And I was very impressed by them.

55:53.520 --> 56:09.894
I thought that they were able, you know, to keep this pretty little classical building going as a good fiction and biography-lending library.

56:10.334 --> 56:16.840
Charming little children's library there, but just round the corner, you know, in a glass-framed

56:17.174 --> 56:17.635
office.

56:18.436 --> 56:24.465
Here was this, you know, one of the greatest and certainly one of the most expensive books in the world.

56:25.246 --> 56:27.149
You mentioned the Redwood Library in Newport.

56:27.370 --> 56:28.852
I gave a talk to it myself.

56:28.952 --> 56:29.953
I'd never seen that.

56:30.254 --> 56:35.041
It's a charming little building, and this library is in its original building.

56:35.061 --> 56:37.906
Yes, but, yes, I mean, this is not for quotation.

56:37.926 --> 56:43.334
I mean, because, I mean, yes, please don't put this in.

56:43.354 --> 56:46.118
You see, I mean, Providence is provident.

56:46.570 --> 56:47.972
Newport is Newport.

56:48.914 --> 57:00.513
We went there in November, and Newport in November was quite an amazing place because they are so burdened with heritage.

57:00.773 --> 57:04.379
They've got the oldest synagogue in the United States.

57:07.164 --> 57:12.713
They've got the Preservation Society owns, I think, five of those millionaires' cottages.

57:13.165 --> 57:23.482
They've got a marvelous Episcopal church, they've got a yacht museum, they've got a this, they've got a that, and the Redwood is only, and a fine art museum.

57:23.562 --> 57:27.208
The Redwood is a very minor part of this heritage.

57:27.989 --> 57:29.371
I've never heard of it before.

57:29.452 --> 57:30.193
It is.

57:30.493 --> 57:36.523
But they're also having major administrative

57:38.326 --> 57:39.107
nastinesses.

57:40.428 --> 57:50.978
They've got a new librarian at last, but I mean, they lost two after brief periods, and I'm not going to go into that, but I don't know enough about it to go into it.

57:51.058 --> 58:07.894
But, you know, even if they did get a role for themselves as a community library, there is, you know, a civically funded library there, much larger and more efficient already.

58:08.363 --> 58:12.828
So I couldn't see what they're going to do with it.

58:13.188 --> 58:16.491
It's a historic building with books in it, almost.

58:17.172 --> 58:22.758
Whereas the Providence Avenue, well worth a visit sometime if you are in Providence.

58:23.719 --> 58:25.941
45 minutes from Providence.

58:25.981 --> 58:27.923
Yes, I know.

58:28.764 --> 58:36.312
I think that is the way in which one of those tiny libraries can be really sort of vibrant and not just another well-preserved

58:36.967 --> 58:38.409
historic monument.

58:40.933 --> 58:42.775
Briefly, do you have a compact shelving here?

58:42.955 --> 58:44.017
We've got some, yes.

58:44.698 --> 58:52.088
We can't put it in many parts of the building because it's not structurally.

58:52.248 --> 58:56.615
So it's in the basements and in this new wing that we've got.

58:57.215 --> 59:02.383
The Athenaeum, it makes browsing somewhat more... Oh yes, it does.

59:02.463 --> 59:06.889
It's a matter of consenting adults.

59:08.506 --> 59:12.832
Well, I think we've covered the high points, and you have to be good.

59:12.852 --> 59:16.176
Could you, would there be some literature that... Yes, okay.

59:16.497 --> 59:22.404
What I'm going to do is get you a copy of the founders and followers, and some of our recent annual reports as well.

59:23.185 --> 59:25.248
So if we wait just a moment, I'll just go and get... Excellent.

59:25.268 --> 59:32.498
...the lease ran out.

59:33.078 --> 59:36.403
We were able to get rid of that building.

59:36.643 --> 59:38.125
What we've got now is a basement.

59:38.611 --> 59:43.696
preparation room and shop for another Italian cafe, which is a sandwich bar.

59:44.597 --> 59:50.423
We've got a workroom there, and then one, two, three, four, five floors of book storage.

59:50.884 --> 59:52.145
And that's where we put in the rare books.

59:52.666 --> 59:55.909
That's great.

59:57.751 --> 01:00:05.159
What I was about to ask is, if we request permission to reproduce that painting, how would we go about that?

01:00:05.179 --> 01:00:06.981
I think ask through me.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:16.427
The original, it's done by David Henson for the library's use, but I think if we're actually reproducing it in the book, I think we'd have to ask him.

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:23.340
That's fine, and we'd be willing to do that to pay him his... This is the original, he's just about to go get framed.

01:00:24.442 --> 01:00:29.571
I mean, I could take a photograph, but there'd be nothing to come close to.

01:00:29.591 --> 01:00:31.635
I mean, a building, that's quite wonderful.

01:00:32.206 --> 01:00:33.908
But that's down the road a bit.

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:38.214
Yes, but that's the... Will you ask a question for me?

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.516
It's a kind of caption.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:40.097
It's wonderful.

01:00:40.597 --> 01:00:45.063
I think it's absolutely marvellous that, and we've got quite a lot of others of his, but... You know what?

01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:46.545
This is our annual Christmas card.

01:00:46.565 --> 01:00:48.808
I was just about to say, you should publish that.

01:00:48.828 --> 01:00:51.873
Well, we sold $10,000.

01:00:52.453 --> 01:00:53.375
Is it for sale out here?

01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:54.757
No, I'm afraid not.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:59.563
We sold out the Monday before Christmas.

01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:02.350
We make absolute birthday tickets.

01:01:03.031 --> 01:01:05.794
We commission one every year, sometimes humorous.

01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:11.722
Can I have a copy of your application form?

01:01:11.822 --> 01:01:15.887
Do you have an international friends group?

01:01:16.067 --> 01:01:16.588
We do.

01:01:16.608 --> 01:01:20.212
We don't actually have a leaflet about them, though.

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:26.580
It's run by an investment man in New York.

01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:35.330
and I think the chances of the sacred ship's going to change, so we'll be getting... As you get any information, maybe you could email me or... Certainly.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:41.659
What I'll do is get you... We sent to the newsletter last year, who is anyone this?

01:01:46.246 --> 01:01:55.960
I may just want to write a magazine piece as well and get you a little exposure.

01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:20.328
Sir Stephen Runciman, the historian of Rosenthal, who joined at the age of 20, the day after his birthday in 1923.

01:02:20.628 --> 01:02:26.697
And this year he's going to be 75 years a life meddler, and we're giving him a special lunch here in the summer.

01:02:26.757 --> 01:02:32.486
He's one of our vice presidents, Sir Stephen Runciman.

01:02:33.828 --> 01:02:38.755
But they're bound alphabetically.

01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:48.576
It's really difficult to... If you've had a prominent one of someone who's deceased, I wouldn't want to take a photograph.
