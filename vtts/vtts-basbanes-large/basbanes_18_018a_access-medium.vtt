WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:04.957
Okay, it's running.

00:05.278 --> 00:07.344
Okay, we're talking to Johanna Fiedler.

00:07.665 --> 00:17.112
And reading a piece in the Globe, I guess, there's a suggestion that maybe you had second thoughts about having done such a...

00:17.598 --> 00:19.881
a brutally honest book about your father.

00:20.121 --> 00:28.551
I wonder, is that the case, or do you think that now, thinking about it, you might have done it differently than you had?

00:28.571 --> 00:29.492
That's just an opening.

00:29.572 --> 00:30.873
Have you read the book?

00:31.174 --> 00:31.774
Yes, I have.

00:32.375 --> 00:45.310
Yeah, because, I mean, I really honestly felt that the... One of the things that I'm finding is that a book about a family, and particularly in Boston about this family, brings up very strong feelings in people.

00:46.015 --> 00:51.368
Because I really don't see my book as so brutal, to use your word.

00:51.548 --> 00:53.533
Well, and it's not my word.

00:53.573 --> 00:58.765
I'm just, I was kind of surprised, actually, by the piece in the Globe.

00:59.507 --> 01:04.378
I mean, it even suggests that maybe you shouldn't have done it, you know, and I'm wondering where...

01:04.358 --> 01:06.000
where she's coming from on that.

01:06.220 --> 01:07.782
I honestly don't know the answer to that.

01:07.842 --> 01:10.926
I mean, she told me very directly that she just hated the book.

01:11.066 --> 01:11.687
Oh, is that right?

01:11.707 --> 01:15.171
It was a very bitter and angry book, which is not how the book was made.

01:15.191 --> 01:17.454
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have been assigned to the story then.

01:17.554 --> 01:18.615
Yeah.

01:18.776 --> 01:20.377
It surprised me, you know, actually.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.441
It surprised me quite a lot.

01:23.461 --> 01:33.133
I mean, you know, I expected a strong reaction, and I know the other thing is that, you know, somebody who hasn't read the book basically is going to have a preconceived notion of what it's about.

01:33.198 --> 01:41.450
and I know that a lot of people don't have time to read it, but I wrote it because I wanted to... There were a couple of reasons.

01:41.470 --> 01:51.725
I wanted to sort of deal with the relationship I had with my father, which in some ways was almost too close, and to try to sort that out a little bit.

01:52.186 --> 01:56.352
I also had very strong feelings about the way he'd been treated by the Boston Symphony.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.915
That apparently continues to bother you.

01:59.196 --> 02:00.117
Yes, it does.

02:00.265 --> 02:03.649
You might even get into that a little bit, if you'd like.

02:04.610 --> 02:13.460
And the fact is that one of the things I had to sort of defend myself against was being too overprotective of him, which is sort of the opposite of what people are now.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.482
You mean over the years or in this book?

02:15.863 --> 02:25.193
I think over the years I saw, especially after he died, I was outraged by what happened to him, especially after he died with the symphony, but also for many years before.

02:26.034 --> 02:28.737
And I had to finally come to the conclusion that it wasn't

02:28.936 --> 02:30.878
a battle for me to continue fighting.

02:31.659 --> 02:35.324
What particularly outraged you?

02:35.905 --> 02:46.317
I think the whole business about promising to name the wing of Symphony Hall after him and promising to make a library for his scores, because he has an enormous selection of scores.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.982
And then almost the kind of...

02:50.789 --> 02:54.713
What's the word they used to use in the Soviet Union when they kind of rearrange history?

02:55.114 --> 03:06.827
Oh, I... So, you know, in order to give John Williams a chance, it would almost have to be that my father hadn't existed, which I think is unfair both to my father and to John Williams, who can do quite fine on his own.

03:08.629 --> 03:10.271
And, in fact, he did, actually.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.694
Yes, he did.

03:12.714 --> 03:17.539
Who had they made, had they made such a commitment to, or just kind of all verbal stuff?

03:17.941 --> 03:20.405
Well, it's actually in the book.

03:20.565 --> 03:28.857
There was, in fact, there was an article in the Globe about how the trustees had found a press release announcing that they were going to name the new wing after Papa.

03:29.358 --> 03:32.363
Because I remember we used to joke about the Fiedler wing, like the chicken wing.

03:33.985 --> 03:39.474
And I quote all of that in the book, the actual press release.

03:39.494 --> 03:42.638
And then, with no explanation, it suddenly became the Cohen wing.

03:43.219 --> 03:43.780
Jeez.

03:43.928 --> 03:49.938
And my mother finally got tired of them saying, oh, yes, we're going to do something with the scores at some point.

03:49.958 --> 03:54.266
Meantime, they were sitting in the cellar of Symphony Hall rotting away.

03:54.326 --> 04:00.156
So she took them back and gave them to Boston University, who, in fact, have now built a beautiful library for them.

04:00.436 --> 04:01.338
Yeah, that's great.

04:01.478 --> 04:03.321
Howard Gottlieb is the... He's wonderful.

04:03.622 --> 04:11.431
Yeah, he's great, and he really, he's perfect for 20th century things, too, which is the subject of a book that I've just written, by the way.

04:11.591 --> 04:13.113
Oh, congratulations.

04:13.133 --> 04:13.473
Thanks.

04:13.773 --> 04:15.796
20th century.

04:15.816 --> 04:17.277
No, that's just a second.

04:17.297 --> 04:25.967
It's actually about bibliomania, book collecting by individuals and institutions and preservation of things like that.

04:26.150 --> 04:29.095
I mean, that must be a fascinating subject these days with computers.

04:29.956 --> 04:35.805
Well, thankfully there will always be books, you know.

04:35.825 --> 04:40.432
I mean, I think one of the things that most writers worry about is not being able to look at, you know, the early drafts.

04:40.452 --> 04:41.954
There are no more.

04:41.974 --> 04:44.298
Yeah, that's the truth.

04:44.398 --> 04:46.902
And did you write this on a computer yourself, for instance?

04:46.922 --> 04:48.044
I printed out every draft.

04:48.084 --> 04:48.424
Did you?

04:48.905 --> 04:53.091
Mostly as a lesson to myself in some ways, so that, you know, I could look back and see.

04:53.131 --> 04:54.233
Because, I mean, everybody makes.

04:54.483 --> 04:57.121
has their own set of mistakes that they make over and over again.

04:57.141 --> 04:57.846
Of course, yeah.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.920
One of the problems with being a writer is that

05:00.136 --> 05:04.021
Because you don't get any feedback until the book is published, you keep making the same decisions.

05:04.041 --> 05:04.321
Isn't it?

05:04.341 --> 05:07.885
I mean, and that is the difference between you, especially coming from a musical family.

05:08.005 --> 05:09.607
The rewards are immediate, aren't they?

05:09.627 --> 05:10.668
They are, yes.

05:10.688 --> 05:15.274
As opposed to the book, you have no idea until it's out there.

05:15.334 --> 05:16.835
Yes, a desire for immediate gratification.

05:16.956 --> 05:17.236
Right.

05:17.256 --> 05:18.417
Something that goes out of your life.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.080
Now, you did intend at one point to write a novel.

05:21.681 --> 05:22.882
Yes, I did.

05:23.363 --> 05:29.350
And later decided, heck with it, let's do it straight out carefully.

05:29.836 --> 05:39.493
Yeah, somebody actually said something to me yesterday that, you know, because I said one of the things that, you know, I was finding very painful to deal with is that nobody seems to be looking at this as a piece of writing.

05:40.114 --> 05:41.376
I worked so hard on it.

05:42.277 --> 05:49.650
And he said in that situation, probably it would have been better to write it as fiction, that some people might have looked at the writing more closely.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.055
Well, would it have been as a novel?

05:52.355 --> 05:55.201
I mean, a Finley, a Romana Clay?

05:55.662 --> 05:57.005
Not the way I was writing it.

05:57.246 --> 05:59.951
It was dealing with the issues without dealing with the facts.

06:00.192 --> 06:06.846
And, you know, in fact, it has been very good for me to sort of say this is what happened and look at it in chronological order.

06:06.926 --> 06:09.592
And it's been great to get it all in perspective.

06:10.013 --> 06:10.153
Mm-hmm.

06:10.775 --> 06:16.221
What are some of the misconceptions that people had about your father that you think?

06:16.902 --> 06:20.186
I mean, certainly while he was alive, he was revered.

06:20.306 --> 06:34.542
I mean, do you think that perhaps this does kind of, is kind of an iconoclastic thing in a way that might tarnish the reputation that he had?

06:34.562 --> 06:35.584
I don't think so.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.287
First of all, my father, I mean, I don't know if you ever met him.

06:38.587 --> 06:39.208
Never did, no.

06:39.508 --> 06:40.309
He was...

06:41.521 --> 06:44.625
If he had a Santa Claus image, it was no thanks to him.

06:46.248 --> 06:49.713
He was a very crusty cantankerous person.

06:49.733 --> 06:52.557
And he never made the slightest effort to hide that.

06:53.318 --> 06:54.980
And people see what they want to see.

06:55.461 --> 06:56.122
They loved him, though.

06:56.142 --> 07:02.331
I mean, I saw him perform, you know, numbers of times out here in the Worcester area.

07:03.037 --> 07:04.399
He loved Worcester.

07:04.479 --> 07:07.822
That place where the belly dancers were.

07:07.843 --> 07:10.445
That's right, the El Morocco.

07:11.607 --> 07:14.270
He conducted Worcester whenever he could.

07:14.290 --> 07:17.814
Yeah, and they took good care of him up there too, the Booty brothers.

07:18.274 --> 07:27.605
But yeah, my father loved to eat and he loved to drink and he loved women and that going to El Morocco is part of his enjoyment of life.

07:28.867 --> 07:29.247
Yeah.

07:30.307 --> 07:48.059
Of course, the book does speak for itself, so we are dancing around here, which is important, but I am looking for... I read also where you have had some therapy for your own problems.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.108
Did you find that the writing of this book was a therapeutic exercise for you?

07:53.442 --> 07:57.587
Yes, that's not really the reason I did it, but of course it does have that side effect.

07:57.887 --> 08:06.136
I think it's important to point that out, that you didn't do this as a way to exorcise the demons, so to speak, but it did serve that for you.

08:06.156 --> 08:17.088
It definitely, especially coming back here and also dealing with my feelings about Boston, which have a lot to do with my feelings about my parents.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.952
I can see that it's had a really big effect.

08:21.117 --> 08:25.383
It's not something that you see, you don't write a book and think, ah, I'm all integrated now.

08:26.564 --> 08:30.630
You kind of write the book and then you gradually see the effect it's had on your life.

08:30.730 --> 08:39.001
I mean, spending three years doing something like this and thinking over things, I think has had some kind of beneficial effect, at least I hope so.

08:39.161 --> 08:40.302
That's good.

08:41.464 --> 08:44.588
How have the siblings responded to the book?

08:46.831 --> 08:50.736
I'm sure that they have mixed feelings, but they could not have been nicer, and the

08:50.969 --> 08:55.935
The thing that I expected the least is that it's actually brought us closer together.

08:56.616 --> 09:02.263
In fact, we have not spent a holiday together since my mother died, and we're going to spend Thanksgiving together this year.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.484
Well, that's nice.

09:03.785 --> 09:04.646
Up here?

09:05.106 --> 09:08.350
My sister's in New York.

09:08.531 --> 09:10.413
That's encouraging, isn't it?

09:10.433 --> 09:17.922
No, I mean, my sister said you could have changed my name for hers all the way to the early part of the book, and it was her experience exactly.

09:18.762 --> 09:22.466
She was stunned that I felt the same things that she did.

09:22.926 --> 09:26.210
Except that you were kind of closer to your father, though, being the oldest.

09:26.270 --> 09:27.631
Yes, yeah.

09:28.232 --> 09:35.359
Did that have its special pitfalls, being the oldest child?

09:36.921 --> 09:45.630
I think so, because he was such a sort of dominating personality that I started to define myself in terms of him and closeness to him.

09:46.268 --> 09:59.637
And because that was my place in the family, being Papa's so-called favorite, it became, you know, that became my way of feeling good about myself, which is not a good way to feel good about yourself.

10:01.237 --> 10:04.262
You are a writer now, a published author.

10:04.362 --> 10:05.203
Congratulations.

10:05.264 --> 10:07.067
Thank you.

10:07.127 --> 10:11.894
I mean, I would hope that, I mean, there is a wonderful review in the Wall Street Journal on this book.

10:12.035 --> 10:14.619
I was thrilled by that because I thought he really understood.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.562
It came out the same day as the Globe interview.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.283
Oh, is that right?

10:17.523 --> 10:19.585
It's one of those, the Lord give us and the Lord take us away.

10:19.805 --> 10:20.185
Yeah.

10:20.205 --> 10:22.688
Well, the globe thing is not a review either.

10:22.768 --> 10:24.329
I mean, everybody read it that way.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.391
Obviously, you know because you're in the profession.

10:26.411 --> 10:28.273
Yeah, but I mean, I read it straight away.

10:28.353 --> 10:34.158
And I said, and one of the first things you teach people is, I mean, don't be negative at the beginning.

10:34.919 --> 10:38.662
Give people a reason to read your story.

10:38.702 --> 10:39.923
Never say what a book isn't.

10:40.163 --> 10:44.207
I mean, because then, you know, then what's the point of doing the story?

10:44.327 --> 10:45.148
I mean...

10:45.432 --> 10:47.736
And there's one who used to assign books to a review.

10:47.817 --> 10:53.888
I mean, if people come with this kind of baggage, you know, maybe I ought to be giving it to somebody else.

10:54.048 --> 10:55.952
Well, somebody said to me, you know, where was her editor?

10:57.034 --> 10:58.958
You don't have editors at the Globe anymore.

10:58.978 --> 11:03.306
Well, you know, but then maybe the editor audited it too, you know.

11:03.775 --> 11:29.715
i mean sometimes you get what you want by giving it to a certain person without having without i mean that's the way this this business unfortunately is uh and yet your father's recordings continue to uh his music continues to be a source of uh of uh reward for the boston symphony isn't that right yes it certainly does i mean did you think they saw him as the cash cow so to speak

11:30.758 --> 11:32.501
I think in some ways they still do.

11:32.581 --> 11:49.513
One of the trustees who I met at a dinner party at Martha's Vineyard said to me recently that the symphony's very happy still to be receiving these very nice royalties from his recordings because the symphony gets most of them because of the contract he signed.

11:50.414 --> 11:52.378
I was surprised that your father really...

11:52.797 --> 11:57.262
I mean, even as recently as the 1970s, that he really wasn't making a tremendous amount of money.

11:57.463 --> 12:01.387
Well, you see, that was one of the misconceptions which in some ways he fostered.

12:01.488 --> 12:07.775
He liked the idea that people thought he was very rich and that he was making lots of money when, in fact, he really wasn't.

12:09.217 --> 12:22.433
Because it may, I mean, you know, in some ways since he was not able to, what's the word, to kind of produce that for himself, he didn't mind the fact that people thought that was happening even though it wasn't.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.259
What would you like your father's legacy to be?

12:28.941 --> 12:42.715
You know, one of the things I think musically, since music was the most important thing to him, that I think that the world could really use another one of him right now, or another Leonard Bernstein, or someone who makes music so accessible to people.

12:43.956 --> 12:50.783
That, you know, he felt so strongly, you know, when he started out his career, music was really something that was for the elite, for the wealthy.

12:51.421 --> 12:53.284
And he tried very hard to change that.

12:54.245 --> 12:57.029
He mindfully set about doing this, didn't he?

12:57.049 --> 12:58.911
That's where the Esplanade concerts came from.

12:58.931 --> 13:02.256
They were the first free symphony concerts ever given in this country.

13:03.598 --> 13:13.932
And did he do this because he had a respect for people, or do you think maybe... Yes, he really felt that, you know, the idea that music was something he used to say, you shouldn't have to listen to it with your head and your hands.

13:14.814 --> 13:14.954
Mm-hmm.

13:14.974 --> 13:20.001
He said music is something to be enjoyed, and he loved music the way he loved... I mean, he really loved life.

13:20.782 --> 13:20.922
Mm-hmm.

13:20.969 --> 13:27.600
And music was something that he really enjoyed, and he couldn't understand why people took it in some way so seriously.

13:27.620 --> 13:31.086
I mean, he took it very seriously, but he also enjoyed it.

13:31.486 --> 13:35.172
And he thought it was very sad that that was not a general feeling.

13:35.973 --> 13:38.918
And it seems to me that classical music could really use that now.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.222
Now, I've seen two...

13:42.248 --> 14:02.799
references, several references, that suggest this... I mean, I know you must hate this question, but how do you respond to suggestions that this is kind of a Papa Dearest treatment, even though a reading of the book clearly shows that it is not, you know?

14:02.819 --> 14:05.643
I mean, the fact is that most people who ask me that haven't read the book.

14:05.663 --> 14:06.044
That's right.

14:07.025 --> 14:08.307
I mean, I was on that...

14:08.624 --> 14:19.014
There's this new television network called America's Talking, and I was on one of their shows, which was a call-in thing, and one of the people who called in was Christina Crawford.

14:19.515 --> 14:19.955
Jesus.

14:20.536 --> 14:22.218
Well, she's promoting her latest book.

14:22.238 --> 14:22.818
Uh-huh.

14:22.838 --> 14:29.125
But, I mean, she said, you know, I was the forerunner of all these books, and I thought, yeah, you're responsible.

14:29.145 --> 14:32.528
You're responsible for the stereotype, too, unfortunately.

14:33.749 --> 14:33.849
Yeah.

14:33.869 --> 14:35.791
Would you describe it as a loving memoir?

14:36.392 --> 14:37.433
I love it.

14:37.463 --> 14:40.636
I think candid but loving, yes.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.054
I don't think that loving necessarily means that you don't see the negative qualities.

14:45.295 --> 14:45.938
That's right.

14:47.133 --> 15:16.110
um i'm the only person in boston that way right now well see he does he does retain his his uh his almost mythical stature doesn't he i think it's even grown a bit especially since he's not around he bore and yell at people come to get his autograph yeah but i mean that is the problem that is that is a problem isn't it when you try to write honestly about a human being who has taken on uh also very especially true in boston i mean the other cities i've been to um

15:16.580 --> 15:20.126
He's a popular figure, but he doesn't have this mythic quality.

15:22.070 --> 15:26.858
It is paradoxical, then, that they don't recognize him at the symphony, then, isn't it?

15:26.918 --> 15:27.038
Yeah.

15:27.178 --> 15:27.659
Given that?

15:27.819 --> 15:28.721
Absolutely.

15:29.222 --> 15:32.287
I mean, do you think it's institutional and it's petty and it's inside?

15:32.407 --> 15:34.691
I can't explain.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.174
I don't understand it.

15:36.194 --> 15:37.055
I really don't.

15:37.136 --> 15:41.423
I mean, partly it's that the current administration are people that didn't know him.

15:42.196 --> 15:52.548
that, you know, sort of, and there was this concerted effort in the past to kind of basically blunt his image so that John Williams could develop his own following.

15:53.089 --> 15:54.470
Well, so Williams is leaving, though.

15:54.611 --> 15:56.293
That's right, and now there's nobody.

15:56.613 --> 15:56.793
Yeah.

15:57.654 --> 16:00.818
I mean, there's a plaque over there for the musicians on the Titanic.

16:01.218 --> 16:04.162
And there's not, my father's, you realize, there's no picture of my father.

16:04.302 --> 16:12.051
Yeah, no, I was there for the opening the other night, and having already, you know, been aware of what you say here, looking around, and...

16:12.031 --> 16:14.513
Not so much seeing who isn't there, but seeing who is there.

16:15.194 --> 16:17.216
And contrast, you know, by contrast.

16:17.256 --> 16:21.340
No, I mean, I was at Tanglewood this summer and I went through the new hall and some of the new buildings.

16:21.380 --> 16:27.766
They have a new sort of kind of place where people who give lots of money can go and sit and be comfortable before the concert.

16:27.786 --> 16:33.072
And there are pictures of people who have appeared with the orchestra over the years, you know, soloists and guest conductors.

16:33.412 --> 16:34.853
Not one picture of my father.

16:35.734 --> 16:36.635
And that really hurts.

16:38.197 --> 16:41.700
As much as I try to tell myself it's not my battle, it still hurts.

16:42.001 --> 16:50.353
How can a book like this be instructive for other children of famous people, or did you have that at all in mind when you wrote the book?

16:51.354 --> 16:54.439
Well, if it could be, I'd be sort of happy, I guess.

16:54.939 --> 16:55.520
I'm not sure.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.603
It's not something you have to come to by yourself.

16:58.805 --> 17:04.413
And you certainly had your own personal problems, which you get into in the book.

17:04.994 --> 17:05.214
Yes, I did.

17:05.234 --> 17:08.599
Which don't need to be elaborated upon here.

17:10.250 --> 17:10.731
I'm sorry.

17:10.771 --> 17:11.211
I'm sorry.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.734
I'm all over the block this morning.

17:12.794 --> 17:13.936
You'll have to forgive me.

17:13.956 --> 17:14.196
That's okay.

17:14.216 --> 17:15.879
I'm sure you're probably exhausted.

17:15.899 --> 17:20.506
I'm not only... I'm under... My edited manuscript is back from New York.

17:20.566 --> 17:24.612
It was due in the 3rd, which was, what, Monday.

17:25.954 --> 17:27.376
You know they give you false deadlines.

17:27.396 --> 17:27.917
Don't worry.

17:28.077 --> 17:28.337
I know.

17:28.357 --> 17:29.359
And he already told me.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.621
And you know what it is?

17:30.641 --> 17:33.425
It's a 900-page manuscript, too.

17:33.445 --> 17:33.926
Good Lord.

17:33.946 --> 17:37.371
And they hired a copy editor...

17:37.739 --> 17:59.562
i've got to meet this woman when it's over she's not from boston she is from somerville and it was pixie no her name is kate scott because mine was also from boston her name was pixie i have to call her they have great characters these people oh i mean i i owe so much to this woman and then i i i've called my editor twice now ellen peacock at home i said ellen

17:59.542 --> 18:01.244
You've got to give me this woman's phone number.

18:01.264 --> 18:01.625
He said, why?

18:01.645 --> 18:02.185
What do you want?

18:02.205 --> 18:03.126
I mean, she's very defensive.

18:03.146 --> 18:07.892
I said, I want to call her and thank her, you know, and ask her a few points.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.674
But, I mean, she has found things.

18:10.515 --> 18:12.277
It was like a graduate course in writing.

18:12.297 --> 18:13.399
Jesus.

18:13.419 --> 18:17.464
Well, I have a line there, something about which can be summarized briefly.

18:18.004 --> 18:19.286
And she takes out the briefly.

18:19.386 --> 18:20.267
Exactly.

18:20.956 --> 18:22.799
He says, what's the summary after all?

18:22.839 --> 18:25.523
You know, you love it, you know.

18:25.543 --> 18:29.710
And she insults you when you're stupid, too, which I like, you know, the margins.

18:31.593 --> 18:38.584
So I've got, as a fact book, as is yours, you know, they check everything.

18:38.624 --> 18:49.140
It's not like fiction where you can use any old... I also, by the way, gave part of the manuscript to the Boston Symphony to fact check because I wanted to be absolutely sure my facts were correct.

18:49.306 --> 18:53.252
And in fact, I had Kuzovitsky's death date wrong, which they caught.

18:53.392 --> 18:58.560
So I'm absolutely confident that the facts in the book are accurate.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.122
That's interesting.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.466
Did they comment on anything?

19:02.486 --> 19:03.747
Did they question anything?

19:04.889 --> 19:10.217
I think Kenneth Haas told Richard Dyer from The Globe that he thought it was well written, actually.

19:11.497 --> 19:12.699
What would you like to write next?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.080
Did I ask you that?

19:14.501 --> 19:16.964
No, actually, I'm just finishing a novel.

19:17.024 --> 19:17.926
I still write fiction.

19:19.227 --> 19:23.573
I still try to do a novel, which is a kind of mystery about a symphony orchestra.

19:24.234 --> 19:28.580
But I'm probably going to start another fiction book.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.462
And have you published any fiction, by the way?

19:30.542 --> 19:31.043
No, I haven't.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.927
So this is a... That's a dream.

19:35.188 --> 19:37.271
True or not, I don't know.

19:37.291 --> 19:40.255
Just looking briefly through the book here...

19:41.635 --> 19:43.858
You know, it's really, you explain everything I need.

19:43.878 --> 19:50.588
I don't have to... How much time did you spend on it?

19:50.628 --> 19:53.332
I guess maybe you can tell me that.

19:53.753 --> 19:54.754
I researched it.

19:54.854 --> 20:00.042
I mean, I came back to Boston, which was... I mean, I didn't, in the end, use all the research I did.

20:00.142 --> 20:02.525
In fact, there's about 300 pages missing from the book.

20:02.545 --> 20:05.930
The history of the Boston Symphony, the history of music in the United States.

20:05.950 --> 20:09.015
You know, all the stuff everybody does when they're trying to put off writing the hard bars.

20:10.397 --> 20:10.697
Um...

20:11.707 --> 20:13.950
And coming back to Boston was very important.

20:13.970 --> 20:18.475
And then I spent a year writing it and a year rewriting it.

20:18.495 --> 20:25.322
And we're talking to Harold Bloom, who's written a wonderful book called The Western Canon.

20:25.683 --> 20:38.177
I have to say, in recent memory, I cannot recall a book of literary criticism that has prompted this much public response, general response.

20:38.817 --> 20:39.939
Did you anticipate this?

20:40.379 --> 20:41.140
No.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.325
I can recall one such book, and I don't think I'm being vainglorious.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.546
It was called The Book of Jay.

20:47.166 --> 20:52.672
And it was what I wrote about what we now call Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers.

20:53.273 --> 20:54.795
That was four or five years ago.

20:55.075 --> 20:56.597
I have it in front of me as we speak.

20:56.737 --> 21:10.992
But literary criticism, my part of it, which is the basic part of the book, I suppose it was taken since people in the United States so frequently receive

21:11.528 --> 21:16.332
biblical criticism as being something other than literary criticism.

21:17.113 --> 21:19.795
I suppose it was taken to be something that it was not.

21:20.476 --> 21:24.360
But I didn't really know what to expect, sir.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.141
I didn't know what to expect this time.

21:26.281 --> 21:38.212
I thought that on the one hand, since it is more or less a kind of magnum opus, I'm in my 40th consecutive year of teaching full-time at Yale.

21:38.612 --> 21:40.354
I'm 64, and I've been

21:41.212 --> 21:44.637
an obsessive reader and writer all my life.

21:44.998 --> 22:04.646
And this is a kind of summary, really, summing up of what I understand about the main course of Western literature from Dante to the present day.

22:04.666 --> 22:10.054
I mean, it studies 26 authors whom I take as representative of the

22:10.793 --> 22:12.034
canon.

22:13.196 --> 22:24.349
I suppose that two factors that have so far on the whole aroused more interest than what I think matters about the book.

22:24.369 --> 22:39.467
That is to say, 95% of the book is a study of 26 writers from Dante and Shakespeare and Chaucer and Milton and Montaigne and Molyer on through at the end, Proust and Beckett and

22:40.072 --> 22:43.178
James Joyce and Virginia Woolf and Freud.

22:43.819 --> 22:55.802
But most of the press and journalistic and most of the review attention has focused either on the canonical list that I get at the back and, in particular,

22:56.626 --> 22:59.670
The contemporary part of it, particularly contemporary America.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.952
Who you left out, basically.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.376
They seem miffed by some of your omissions, I'm afraid.

23:06.277 --> 23:09.822
A number of people seem to be miffed by some of your omissions.

23:10.022 --> 23:18.752
I suppose that was inevitable because no two people are going to make the same list, and I don't really see why they should be miffed.

23:19.222 --> 23:25.529
I don't pretend to be a canon maker, as I make very clear, and I even say that cultural prophecy is a mug's game.

23:26.530 --> 23:35.941
I simply say that this is the best yes I can make on the basis of what I've read twice and thought could sustain real further rereading.

23:36.842 --> 23:39.645
And it does represent a lifetime of reading, doesn't it?

23:39.745 --> 23:40.646
It does represent that.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.471
I mean, this could not have been written by a man of 44, shall we say.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.993
No, I could not have written it at 44.

23:46.373 --> 23:48.115
I could not have written it at 54.

23:48.736 --> 23:51.200
I could only have written it now.

23:52.862 --> 24:00.373
And, of course, the other thing that has aroused interest, and that is, I think, more legitimate, though it still is not, what matters about the book.

24:00.513 --> 24:18.439
I mean, perhaps 5% of the text of the book, the opening chapter and the closing chapter, both of them deliberately calling themselves an elegy for the canon and an elegiate conclusion, are an attack upon...

24:18.757 --> 24:29.134
the terrible degeneration of literary study in the universities and colleges and indeed in the secondary schools now as well.

24:29.354 --> 24:38.930
That is to say, the replacement of aesthetic criteria by political and so-called multicultural criteria.

24:40.432 --> 24:45.220
So-called, because I don't think it is multicultural, just as, you know,

24:45.537 --> 25:08.524
what are called in our universities and colleges feminist literary criticism and marxist literary criticism and this that and the other kind of literature has nothing to do with marxism and absolutely nothing to do with feminism in the legitimate um political economic and social sense it is amazing that uh

25:09.415 --> 25:10.336
I'm surprised now.

25:10.677 --> 25:18.828
Are you still waiting for any of the big responses from the feminist critics, the so-called Marxist critics?

25:19.810 --> 25:27.781
I think that they, well, some of them, of course, have gotten their shots in because journalists have gone to them.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.044
For the quotes.

25:30.304 --> 25:39.237
Some of them have, of course, their allies among the journalists in the book.

25:39.892 --> 26:07.249
several times I describe what I call the School of Resentment as an academic journalistic network and I have heard from some members of the journalistic network but I suspect that the real response on the part of the School of Resentment will come in what they control they control the

26:07.853 --> 26:17.485
so-called scholarly magazines and journals, which no longer are scholarly magazines and journals, but have been politicized and have nothing to do with learning.

26:17.505 --> 26:36.207
In fact, as I have told several interviewers, but none as passionately as I'm saying this to you because you will understand this far better than the other interviewers because of your interests, one of the saddest things for me about a lifetime spent

26:37.216 --> 26:49.914
at Yale University is that until about 15 years ago, if you wanted to praise a young man or a young woman who was a beginning scholar, you talked about their learning.

26:50.515 --> 26:59.347
I haven't heard the word learning used either as a descriptive or eulogistic term at Yale University, certainly for the last decade.

26:59.427 --> 27:06.497
Is this a pessimistic book, at least in the opening and the closing chapters?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.190
Well, it's dialectical, isn't it?

27:09.851 --> 27:18.880
I mean, I do think that the war I'm trying to fight against this goal of resentment is already a lost war.

27:20.402 --> 27:29.010
The reviewer in the Sunday Times book review, I think that was Mr. Fruman of, is he the University of Minnesota?

27:29.330 --> 27:30.692
Not a man that I know.

27:30.792 --> 27:37.058
I think I read his book on Coleridge many years ago, but we've never met or corresponded or ever been in touch with each other.

27:37.375 --> 27:46.767
What I thought was an intelligent and generous review, either he or the Times, the Sunday Times Book Review editors entitled it, Bloom et Thermopylae.

27:47.568 --> 27:51.433
And I suppose that's the way I do feel about it.

27:53.636 --> 28:06.353
On the basis of my observation of American universities and colleges, the study of the humanities, it's not doomed forever, but it's going through a very, very bad patch of...

28:06.822 --> 28:16.032
which is likely to go well into the next generation because this goal of resentment is a network, and it has established itself everywhere.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.435
And it's very active.

28:19.455 --> 28:28.625
What it means by political, it turns out, has nothing to do with national politics or state politics or municipal politics, about which these people couldn't care less.

28:29.205 --> 28:33.690
It strictly has to do with academic politics, at which they are superbly organized.

28:34.109 --> 28:38.135
You do say, though, I have very little confidence that literary education will survive.

28:38.155 --> 29:01.669
I have very little confidence, indeed, that literary education, in the sense in which I received a literary education as a Cornell undergraduate and then as a Yale graduate student that I've been trying to give myself all my life, I have very little confidence that that will survive.

29:02.290 --> 29:11.789
Most of the departments of English throughout the country are already in the process of being renamed as departments of cultural studies.

29:12.310 --> 29:23.252
And even when they aren't being renamed, in fact, the study of English and American or of world literature is in fact being replaced by what are called cultural studies.

29:23.485 --> 29:25.887
which do not, of course, have aesthetic criteria.

29:26.328 --> 29:32.774
To give you an example, just last week, I needed to read a copy of Cicero's Proarchia.

29:33.615 --> 29:35.997
I couldn't find one here in central Massachusetts.

29:36.077 --> 29:39.060
I had to go to the Boston Athenaeum.

29:39.080 --> 29:49.290
...in the part of the country which buys the most books, which reads the most books, which has more university and college students... It's amazing, isn't it?

29:49.310 --> 29:51.872
...than any other place in the country...

29:53.152 --> 29:56.091
And you're talking about one of the foundation texts

29:56.425 --> 29:58.026
of Latin culture.

29:58.146 --> 30:02.851
And I'm not just making this up because I checked the computer to see where there were copies.

30:02.911 --> 30:05.092
There were two copies in central Massachusetts.

30:05.233 --> 30:08.255
One at a... There was not one.

30:08.395 --> 30:16.302
Of course, Holy Cross is not on the network, so maybe they... I would hope that they would have one, but basically I had to go to Boston to get this book.

30:16.763 --> 30:18.284
And I mean, it took me two or three days.

30:19.024 --> 30:25.470
And then I was discussing with a young man who was a Harvard graduate, and I asked him if he knew what the proarchia was.

30:26.108 --> 30:28.891
And I didn't know.

30:30.313 --> 30:44.068
There was a time, even 30 years ago, when a Yale undergraduate who was a student of English and American literature not only would have known it, but would have read it.

30:44.268 --> 30:49.013
Would indeed have probably learned a good deal of Latin as I did.

30:51.196 --> 30:52.217
But those days are gone.

30:54.239 --> 30:55.741
Now, how about the number 26?

30:55.841 --> 30:58.285
Was this just because they were 26?

30:59.187 --> 31:00.769
Purely arbitrary.

31:00.789 --> 31:03.193
No mystical significance.

31:04.274 --> 31:20.179
What happened was that I had originally hoped, very unrealistically, my dear, to write about at least 35 or 40 major writers and then discovered that it was impossible to say anything worthwhile about them without...

31:20.885 --> 31:28.456
getting a book which would have been so outsized that I couldn't have had it published, and people couldn't afford to buy it, and nobody would have been able to read it.

31:29.218 --> 31:44.500
So I just gave myself a few basic rules, which is that the very greatest Western writers, you know, Shakespeare and Chaucer, that is to say, it was partly because of this that I cut down the scope in time.

31:44.541 --> 31:45.542
I had originally thought

31:46.045 --> 31:59.629
But I would start with what the great Vico, whose scheme I, and as I said in the book, in a serial, comic way, adopted pretty much following Joyce and Finnegan's Wake, the Viconian vision of the cycles.

32:00.271 --> 32:10.028
I had originally been going to start with the theocratic age, and I was going to talk about Homer, and I was going to talk about the Hebrew Bible, and I was going to talk about...

32:11.392 --> 32:16.119
the Athenian dramatists, and I was going to talk about Plato, but of course that was impossible.

32:16.799 --> 32:23.769
So I simply decided arbitrarily that I said to myself, well, what is the Western canon?

32:23.789 --> 32:32.401
In the first place, more than any other single writer, it's Shakespeare, and in the second place, more than any other writer, even Homer, it's Dante.

32:33.683 --> 32:37.568
And then I said, all right, I'll use Dante as the outer limit on one side,

32:37.936 --> 32:40.560
and Samuel Beckett as the outer limit of the other.

32:40.600 --> 32:48.290
I won't try to look at any living writer, you know, no Garcia Marquez or Thomas Pynchon or any living poet whatsoever.

32:48.331 --> 32:57.884
And then I thought of, all right, who are the overwhelming figures in the major Western languages?

32:57.904 --> 33:01.910
I mean, who is the center of the national canon in each country?

33:02.871 --> 33:06.576
And, of course, it's possible to establish that to some degree,

33:07.079 --> 33:09.562
But then complications arose there also.

33:09.602 --> 33:14.769
This Pushkin is generally taken as the center as well as the real thought of the Russian canon.

33:15.490 --> 33:20.657
But I decided that for a Western reader in general, Tolstoy is the more important figure.

33:21.217 --> 33:23.701
And you didn't include Dostoevsky, of course.

33:23.721 --> 33:24.922
Well, I couldn't.

33:24.942 --> 33:25.543
I had a problem.

33:25.643 --> 33:30.109
I thought of having Dostoevsky as a sort of dark twin to Tolstoy.

33:30.129 --> 33:33.313
And then I realized, well, I was getting into trouble about space again.

33:34.234 --> 33:34.875
In the end,

33:36.037 --> 33:46.353
It's fair to say that, and of course some figures are there to represent, for instance, Hispanic American culture there in Borges and Neruda.

33:47.234 --> 33:57.511
I think that there are greater writers of narrative alive in Borges' time than Borges himself, though he's a very brilliant and fascinating writer.

33:58.172 --> 34:03.580
But he seemed to be the starting point of modern Hispanic American literature.

34:04.538 --> 34:11.566
It's ironic, I thought, that I wound up with only two 20th century poets, Neruda and Pessoa.

34:11.586 --> 34:21.397
I would not for one moment say that the greatest poets of the 20th century are Neruda and Pessoa, though Pessoa in particular, the Portuguese poet, absolutely fascinates me.

34:22.478 --> 34:30.647
I would certainly say that William Butler Yeats and Wallace Stevens and Rania Maria Rilke and Paul Valery and Eugenio Montale

34:31.049 --> 34:39.823
and Hart Crane and Federico Garcia Lorca, you know, are greater poets than Neruda and Pessoa.

34:40.604 --> 34:49.679
But it was a question of being representative, being representative of the different major Western traditions.

34:49.699 --> 34:53.665
So in the end, these are the 26 I wound up with.

34:54.066 --> 34:55.808
But it's purely arbitrary.

34:56.389 --> 34:58.693
It could as well have been 22 or 30.

34:59.129 --> 35:27.769
there were questions of limitation I'm curious in the appendices at the back of the list when you do the Greek the plays you have three different translations of Sophocles for instance well what I tried to do when it came to translations if there was no translation in English that overwhelmingly struck me as indeed being overwhelming

35:28.188 --> 35:44.155
far superior to all the others, and I simply listed the work without picking a translation, where it had been my experience that a particular translator had done better with a particular play than anyone else had, at least in my judgment of it, than I put that in.

35:44.962 --> 35:47.564
But I didn't want to actually bother to say that.

35:48.225 --> 35:56.033
I'm curious also that you include a translation of Dante in Terzo Rima, which I've never seen.

35:56.613 --> 36:05.361
Well, I thought that I wanted to try to give people who read no Italian some sense of what Dante is like.

36:05.442 --> 36:13.429
The most useful translation into modern English is beyond any question the Sinclair, the John Deese translation.

36:13.449 --> 36:14.310
Yes, that's wonderful.

36:14.695 --> 36:18.523
in those three Oxford paper black volumes, but it is a prose translation.

36:19.245 --> 36:22.352
Very good, accurate prose, at times very strong prose.

36:22.913 --> 36:27.042
But then I thought, well, you want something that gives the effect of the terturema.

36:27.082 --> 36:34.358
There are a lot of different possibilities, but I thought that in the end, the Lawrence Binion one, probably,

36:35.705 --> 36:38.749
came closer to doing the impossible than anybody else does.

36:39.289 --> 36:43.034
Not for quotation, but what did you think of Mandelbaum's translation?

36:43.074 --> 36:45.877
Is it not for quotation?

36:46.098 --> 36:47.059
I'm sorry?

36:47.139 --> 36:48.120
Not for quotation.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.041
Yeah, not for quotation.

36:49.442 --> 37:00.015
It always seems to me that Mandelbaum, whom I know and whom I honor for his learning and his ingenuity, that he always just sort of misses as a translator.

37:00.695 --> 37:04.480
His Virgil I just don't find as effective as Robert Fitzgerald's.

37:05.050 --> 37:12.099
His Dante, I don't find as effective as several rival Dante translators, and so it goes.

37:15.023 --> 37:22.852
Do you subscribe to Hazlitt's comment, which you quote at the back of the book, I have more confidence in the dead than the living?

37:24.374 --> 37:26.297
It's a wonderful quote we're talking about.

37:26.517 --> 37:31.243
Well, if only because, as he says, and I quoted it,

37:31.848 --> 37:35.633
Partly as a kind of warning to myself.

37:38.696 --> 37:43.722
It is very difficult because you've been an active critic all your life, and I have.

37:44.944 --> 37:46.446
You make a lot of close friends.

37:49.229 --> 37:55.156
Sometimes you make them because, you know, you admire the writer and you write some reviews of the writer that matter to the writer.

37:55.637 --> 37:58.480
But Philip Roth and I are now very close friends.

37:58.949 --> 38:09.560
I don't think that affects my judgment of his work because of the stuff that I wrote about him, which caused the friendship to develop, long preceded my knowing the man.

38:10.140 --> 38:11.742
I love Roth, I have to say.

38:11.762 --> 38:22.793
I really think that setting aside the major pension, that is to say pension when he was at his best, Vineland, I carefully left out of my list because I think it's garbage.

38:24.655 --> 38:27.538
But Roth at this point, I would think,

38:28.058 --> 38:36.791
is really, in proportion to the real merits of his recent work, the most undervalued contemporary American novelist.

38:36.811 --> 38:42.319
Operation Shylock was a very great book, which sold scandalously few copies.

38:44.161 --> 38:51.892
People just have this perception of him, which is, of course, they don't read anymore, so that's the problem.

38:51.972 --> 38:57.981
Harold, he said, you know that with each of my important books, I sell fewer copies than the one before.

38:58.518 --> 39:20.442
He said, with an occasional exception like Patrimony, which became a bestseller, and was about the father-son relationship, and it's after all a memoir, but he says with the novels, he said, he's beginning to believe that the real problem is that as his older readers die off, they're not being replaced by younger readers, because people just don't really read seriously and deeply anymore.

39:20.692 --> 39:25.257
You use the Kermody, quote, canons are instruments of survival.

39:25.678 --> 39:28.561
I've just pulled these out.

39:28.601 --> 39:31.745
I wonder if you could comment on that in your own response to that.

39:31.945 --> 39:36.751
Well, I think they are instruments of survival.

39:38.092 --> 39:49.686
And, of course, now it's become very complicated because what Sir Frank means there is institutional and societal survival.

39:50.510 --> 40:00.061
I have even greater doubts than he does about the institutional and perhaps even societal survival of a great part of the canon.

40:02.083 --> 40:19.943
Thus, my whole life long I have fiercely loved and indeed frequently taught the poetry of Edmund Spencer, the Fairy Queen in particular, but it's perfectly clear to me that the Fairy Queen, which used to be read by every Yale undergraduate who majored in English, is now read

40:20.378 --> 40:32.816
by very few undergraduates anywhere in the United States, and is becoming a specialized text for a handful of scholars, which is a great sadness because it's a very great and powerful work.

40:33.376 --> 40:37.262
And I'm sure that there are any number of great unread works, aren't there?

40:37.382 --> 40:39.104
Yes, my dear, and there are going to be more.

40:39.805 --> 40:48.057
I despair, for instance, and I say this in the book after I have lovingly analyzed Finnegan's Wake in relation to Shakespeare.

40:48.458 --> 41:08.124
I remark, I think, with some authentic despair that here is a work that I believe, with the exception of Proust, is the greatest thing the 20th century has to offer us in the way of high imaginative literature, more powerful even than Joyce's Ulysses, but that I believe its ultimate survival possibilities are very low.

41:08.485 --> 41:13.612
But isn't that work in particular almost impenetrable, though, to most readers?

41:14.693 --> 41:16.035
Well, I think...

41:20.015 --> 41:22.298
It demands a tremendous amount of labor.

41:22.318 --> 41:25.382
It demands a tremendous amount of labor.

41:25.602 --> 41:29.768
As say, Blake's epics initially demand a tremendous amount of labor.

41:30.669 --> 41:31.950
But it rewards the labor.

41:32.351 --> 41:44.066
And in fact, it may sound silly of me to say this because I've read it so often and taught it so often and thought my way through it so often, but it doesn't seem to me a particularly difficult book.

41:44.086 --> 41:48.672
You just have to, it all depends whether or not you're prepared to enjoy it.

41:49.023 --> 41:50.785
that kind of fabulous wordplay.

41:51.205 --> 41:57.052
But, you know, in that regard, it resembles one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare, Love's Labour's Lost.

41:57.732 --> 41:58.974
That's one of your favorite plays.

41:59.094 --> 42:01.857
Oh, it's the most amazing feast of language.

42:02.477 --> 42:12.568
It's a great extravaganza of crazy language and has a great deal in common in many ways with Finnegan's Wake.

42:12.588 --> 42:14.050
Amazing.

42:14.070 --> 42:16.973
I'm very partial to The Tempest for a number of personal reasons.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.895
I just... Well, my dear, I'm very...

42:19.330 --> 42:26.237
I mean, of Shakespeare's 38 plays, as I remarked somewhere in the book, 24 seemed to me to be absolute masterpieces.

42:26.257 --> 42:31.983
Now Shakespeare is probably, and of course Dante, I think, except in Italy, is probably doomed.

42:32.663 --> 42:39.730
I mean, he has always had the same effect upon major Western poets that Shakespeare has had upon the world in general.

42:40.651 --> 42:49.320
But I believe that outside of Italy that will vanish because we are entering, well,

42:49.604 --> 42:58.417
a new theocratic age, which I just don't believe that sort of technocrat theocratic age.

42:58.537 --> 43:01.160
You know, we were talking earlier about the Tertzerima.

43:02.202 --> 43:13.458
I love the books, and I can't read a word of Italian, but I love the books with the facing pages where you can read the Italian and just, you know, taste the flavor of these words.

43:14.920 --> 43:19.206
But I think that may go also a lot, a lot,

43:19.388 --> 43:20.089
Alas.

43:20.109 --> 43:32.699
That is... I mean, one is reasonably certain that Shakespeare will survive any politicizing, any multiculturalizing, and so on and so forth, because I think we just can't do without him.

43:33.580 --> 43:47.912
And after all, he will survive in performance, even though most contemporary performances of Shakespeare, particularly in this country, are the most amazing travestis by the time the directors... I'm laughing because I've seen a few.

43:47.932 --> 43:48.973
I remember I saw...

43:49.392 --> 43:52.081
Was it at Richard III at Stratford?

43:52.101 --> 43:53.405
It's going to be 15 years ago.

43:53.505 --> 44:01.210
I mean, it was just... No, I have not seen Shakespeare properly done in this country for a very long time.

44:01.290 --> 44:02.153
And I think...

44:02.943 --> 44:06.729
These days they politicize it to death in one way or another.

44:07.030 --> 44:15.824
And yet through it all, as you point out in the book, the universality of the man always manages to shine through.

44:15.844 --> 44:27.162
I'm curious also that when you discuss Whitman, of the nine editions of Leaves of Grass, you pick the first one.

44:27.715 --> 44:29.236
And why is that?

44:29.256 --> 44:32.900
I mean, he felt he was constantly improving right up until the night.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.481
But it wasn't true, I'm afraid.

44:35.622 --> 44:39.165
The three great editions of Leaves of Grass are the first three.

44:40.406 --> 44:43.409
The first one, which is much the best, I think.

44:44.289 --> 44:50.755
It has the best text of the then-untitled poem that eventually would be called Song of Myself.

44:51.956 --> 44:57.621
The second one, which has the initial appearance of the poem called Sundown Poem there,

44:58.057 --> 45:00.420
but eventually it's called Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.

45:00.480 --> 45:14.420
That is to say, the first edition is 1855, the second is 1856, and then the great third edition, which introduces the great sea drift pieces, eventually called As I Ever the Ocean of Life and Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rotten.

45:15.261 --> 45:24.334
Once you get past those three editions, all the changes that Whitman tends to make and all the new poems that he adds,

45:24.668 --> 45:47.534
with the single exception of the one great poem, but it isn't The Leaves of Grass, it's The Drum Taps, in 1865, The Memories of President Lincoln's section, which features, of course, the great lilac trilogy, which I do discuss at some length in the book, and which is as powerful as Edward Whitman ever wrote.

45:48.676 --> 45:53.241
But by and large, I think one could forget the last six editions.

45:53.558 --> 45:56.261
including the famous Deathbed edition.

45:56.281 --> 45:56.842
Which I have.

45:57.042 --> 45:57.983
I've got about four.

45:58.284 --> 46:00.366
I think I've got four of the various editions.

46:01.087 --> 46:02.128
And I may even have a third.

46:02.148 --> 46:02.769
I'm going to check.

46:02.789 --> 46:04.511
It's been a couple of years since I checked.

46:04.531 --> 46:15.725
It's a very good reprint of the third, edited by Roy Harvey Pierce, which was available in paperback and possibly still is available in paperback.

46:15.745 --> 46:18.368
And there are, of course, several reprint editions of the third.

46:19.242 --> 46:25.829
What do you feel about, I mean, this is straying a bit, about writers tinkering with completed work like that?

46:26.770 --> 46:30.213
I mean, Henry James did fool around with some.

46:30.233 --> 46:34.477
There's no ground rule that will work with this.

46:34.497 --> 46:35.278
It seems to me that W.H.

46:35.378 --> 46:46.870
Auden, for instance, who I think is somewhat overrated as a poet anyway, though I have, of course, agreed to his canonical status, I think that Auden tended to mar what he did by revision.

46:47.204 --> 46:52.331
I think that Whitman intended tomorrow what he did by revision, even to censor himself.

46:53.252 --> 46:56.616
But Henry James, I would put on the other side.

46:56.656 --> 47:01.663
It seems to me that the New York edition gives you more powerful text.

47:01.683 --> 47:11.455
For instance, the New York edition of The Portrait of a Lady is a substantially different and more powerful novel than the original Portrait of a Lady.

47:11.836 --> 47:13.718
And the Portrait of...

47:14.086 --> 47:18.105
isabel archer which is a great thing in the book is
