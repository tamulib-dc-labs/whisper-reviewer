00:02.950 --> 00:10.096
No writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the prize can accept it other than with humility.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.680
There is no need to list these writers.

00:14.741 --> 00:22.087
Everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience.

00:22.107 --> 00:31.776
It would be impossible for me to ask the ambassador of my country to read a speech in which a writer said all of the things which are in his heart.

00:33.207 --> 00:50.347
Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate, but eventually they are quite clear, and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses, he will endure or be forgotten.

00:51.529 --> 00:54.172
Writing at its best is a lonely life.

00:55.474 --> 01:02.522
Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing.

01:03.177 --> 01:09.707
He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness, and often his work deteriorates.

01:11.149 --> 01:19.501
For he does his work alone, and if he is a good enough writer, he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

01:21.664 --> 01:28.374
For a true writer, each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment.

01:29.355 --> 01:32.560
He should always try for something that has never been done,

01:33.063 --> 01:35.766
or that others have tried and failed.

01:36.547 --> 01:40.130
Then sometimes, with good luck, he will succeed.

01:41.412 --> 01:49.400
How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written.

01:50.942 --> 02:00.572
It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.398
I have spoken too long for a writer.

02:04.418 --> 02:08.084
A writer should write what he has to say and not speak it.

02:09.186 --> 02:10.088
Again, I thank you.

02:11.891 --> 02:21.106
Now sleeps he with that old whore death who yesterday denied her thrice.

02:21.807 --> 02:23.069
Repeat after me.

02:23.950 --> 02:27.977
Now sleeps he with that old whore death

02:28.379 --> 02:31.884
who yesterday denied her thrice.

02:32.605 --> 02:33.447
Pause.

02:33.467 --> 02:34.789
Wait for them to close up.

02:34.949 --> 02:35.590
Continue.

02:36.732 --> 02:37.713
Did you deny her?

02:38.514 --> 02:38.815
Yes.

02:39.656 --> 02:40.097
Thrice?

02:40.657 --> 02:40.978
Yes.

02:41.919 --> 02:43.161
Repeat after me.

02:44.143 --> 02:51.574
Do you take this old whore death for thy lawful wedded wife?

02:52.736 --> 02:53.797
Repeat after me.

02:54.618 --> 02:55.219
I do.

02:56.041 --> 02:57.002
I do.

02:57.022 --> 02:57.643
I do.

02:58.147 --> 03:09.739
KIA 6OFF, 61EM, 13th September, 2400, 14th September, 2400.

03:10.220 --> 03:10.821
Translate.

03:13.103 --> 03:14.525
Killed in action.

03:15.125 --> 03:24.255
Six officers, 61 enlisted men, from midnight 13th September to midnight 14th September.

03:25.670 --> 03:30.117
Repeat after me 67 times.

03:30.838 --> 03:31.579
I do.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.201
I do.

03:33.822 --> 03:34.403
I do.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.587
67 times.

03:37.648 --> 03:38.289
Continue.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.472
Discontinued.

03:40.492 --> 03:45.300
In the next war we shall bury the dead in cellophane.

03:47.002 --> 03:52.230
In the next war we shall bury the dead in cellophane.

03:53.252 --> 03:54.073
The host

03:54.982 --> 03:57.905
shall come packaged in every k-ration.

03:58.787 --> 04:02.871
The host shall come packaged in every k-ration.

04:03.672 --> 04:21.073
Every man shall be provided with a small but perfect Archbishop Spelman, which shall be self-inflatable, courtesy of air reduction, open, closed, previous, open, closed.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.764
You don't need to repeat this.

04:24.405 --> 04:27.330
There is not any ceremony anymore.

04:27.390 --> 04:31.937
Everyone is gone, and you say this out loud to yourself.

04:32.578 --> 04:36.705
You were alone at the time, and the time now is always.

04:37.727 --> 04:40.291
Always was a word you used in promises.

04:41.012 --> 04:41.973
It is valueless.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.918
All officers...

04:45.185 --> 05:00.984
Warrant officers and enlisted men will be provided with a copy of their own true loves that they will never see again, and all these copies will be returnable through the proper channels.

05:01.004 --> 05:03.347
My own true love is Mary Welsh.

05:04.068 --> 05:08.073
Then, of course, she will be returnable.

05:08.093 --> 05:14.280
But I, on this day, will not accept the signature of Archbishop Spellman

05:14.648 --> 05:18.393
nor of you, nor of you, nor of you.

05:19.414 --> 05:22.258
You may all go now, all of you.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.202
Go as quietly as possible.

05:25.782 --> 05:27.365
Go as far as possible.

05:27.985 --> 05:36.977
You may even take possible with you if you can find him, and you may hang him or dispose of him in any matter that you see fit.

05:37.615 --> 05:46.365
Today, no one uses slang because clarity is of the utmost importance.

05:46.385 --> 05:53.052
Fucking alone is retained, but it is used only as an adjective.

05:53.072 --> 05:54.674
Sweating out is retained.

05:55.015 --> 06:02.543
It means that which one must suffer without any possibility of changing the result or the outcome.

06:03.586 --> 06:11.434
Those of us who know walk very slowly, and we look at one another with infinite love and compassion.

06:12.735 --> 06:18.341
This comes only after 100 days, and it's one of the final symptoms.

06:18.361 --> 06:32.175
There has been irritation, anger, fear, doubt, accusations, denials, misinterpretations, mistakes,

06:32.881 --> 06:40.969
cowardice, inability, and lack of talent for this work.

06:40.989 --> 06:59.646
All this has been and will be again to be counterbalanced by firmness, steadiness, courage, quick understanding, and the ability both to maneuver and to fight.

06:59.666 --> 07:00.627
But now

07:00.978 --> 07:04.323
For a moment, there's only love and compassion.

07:05.705 --> 07:10.092
Know how to endure and only love and compassion.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.015
Repeat it.

07:12.035 --> 07:14.259
Only love and compassion.

07:15.481 --> 07:17.845
For the FBs, too.

07:17.865 --> 07:22.352
Battle fatigues, officers, men, midnight, 13th set.

07:22.372 --> 07:23.734
We don't give any numbers.

07:23.874 --> 07:25.757
Midnight, 14th set.

07:26.058 --> 07:26.478
No.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.842
Then it is not compassion.

07:29.260 --> 07:32.464
Not for the battle fatigues too.

07:32.484 --> 07:35.829
And yes, it is love and compassion.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.392
How can you say that here?

07:39.313 --> 07:40.715
How can you say the other?

07:42.037 --> 07:43.859
Not that we ask for more.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.823
Not that we wish ever any.

07:47.704 --> 07:49.647
Not that we wish any all.

07:50.288 --> 07:52.270
Not that we want any greater.

07:53.652 --> 07:58.018
But when they walked away from that undiscovered country

07:58.522 --> 08:06.170
from whose born no traveler returns who hasn't been there, they walked away from this we cannot state.

08:06.190 --> 08:24.651
And in them died this inner knowing that grows, fresher and lovelier than any rose, manured by death and watered only with unshed tears, until this day it flowers into this love and this compassion.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.495
Not for them, no, I am sorry.

08:28.677 --> 08:33.001
Then it is not complete, no, nor will it be ever.

08:33.021 --> 08:35.183
There is no contrition.

08:35.203 --> 08:38.947
No bloody fucking contrition.

08:39.828 --> 08:42.671
Only love and compassion.

08:42.691 --> 08:57.165
Reach out your hand to love's dark sister Hape, and walk with her across that hill we slowly walked, and see if love is waiting at the top.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.590
who is waiting there instead?

09:00.791 --> 09:05.055
Did I tell you my heart is a target of opportunity?

09:06.236 --> 09:26.595
Love, lovely sister, lovingly unloving, unworryingly succeeding, procuring unprocuringly, never wholly wrong or more than half right, holding unholdingly to hold where love

09:27.740 --> 09:30.003
easily without a dress.

09:30.803 --> 09:37.451
Love lightly leaves without a trace, and her dark sister fills in all the forms.

09:38.892 --> 09:54.810
All, all the forms so neatly filled, the writing clear and good, where love's is often quite illegible, scrawled lightly in a hurry as she smiled, giving unimportance to the page.

09:55.651 --> 09:59.437
Do you think there upon the hill we'll find her there?

10:00.599 --> 10:00.759
No.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.182
She's long gone.

10:03.743 --> 10:06.167
She never stands to fight.

10:06.187 --> 10:19.327
Knowing too well the idiocy of battle, love's always gone, leaving us only the deserted sacrament, as one finds dinner on the table in the house of a new-taken village.

10:20.188 --> 10:24.595
So that we were it now, traces of it are worn on our chins,

10:25.013 --> 10:48.143
like remnants of the yoke of the rare and much-desired egg, our scooped-up, newly-eaten sacrament, bringing it with our newly-issued pictures of our true loves up toward the high ground beyond the town, toward the easy, dirt-mouthed smile we had denied so many days, the plus 108.

10:51.448 --> 10:54.852
Now all move slowly, plodding up that hill,

10:55.270 --> 10:59.734
Making feet slowly go, for they know better than to take you.

10:59.754 --> 11:02.616
Feet are wise and feet are wary.

11:02.636 --> 11:05.259
Feet of John and feet of Harry.

11:05.279 --> 11:07.320
Feet know better, feet won't go.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.343
Make feet move on slowly now.

11:10.864 --> 11:20.592
Make feet follow where no plow leads you ahead, for things are sown toward the place where you'll be dead.

11:20.612 --> 11:23.995
Return her now through the prescribed channels.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.621
Returner.

11:27.243 --> 11:28.966
This will aid you.

11:28.986 --> 11:30.788
Song to aid you to returner.

11:33.111 --> 11:36.656
What they will do to others, they will do to you.

11:37.758 --> 11:40.982
If you never suffer, God will see you through.

11:41.923 --> 11:49.834
Onward, Christian soldiers marching to a whore with the cross of Mary Welsh going on before.

11:51.356 --> 11:52.598
Throw your love away.

11:53.135 --> 11:55.138
You must do it slowly now.

11:55.178 --> 11:57.341
Slowly now and pray.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.484
Pray to all of nothing.

12:00.025 --> 12:01.306
Pray to all of nil.

12:01.927 --> 12:05.252
Throw away your own true love, walking up a hill.

12:06.754 --> 12:07.735
Repeat it now again.

12:07.775 --> 12:14.164
Now sleeps he with that old Lord Death, who yesterday denied her thrice.

12:14.532 --> 12:39.966
If you know, if you conceive, if you too, if, if, if, not the poem that was given you framed for Christmas in Oak Park, Illinois, written by Rudyard Kipling, but the other if, older than the if of Hamlet, the old, long, ugly if that we have faced in all the nights and all the forests of our hearts,

12:40.638 --> 13:09.666
always coming out into a clearing, always sighting finally the smoke of the campfire, now on this wooded hill again, if, ifingly to proceed, if we know ifs, my true love, while we expend that which is not expendable, while we destroy that which is indestructible, with nothing more than harassing fire, nothing more than that,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.585
All my heart is a target of opportunity.

13:14.487 --> 13:17.311
All of us have been interdicted.

13:17.331 --> 13:19.054
This is not the way it was.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.517
I have not been there.

13:20.537 --> 13:21.638
No one was there.

13:22.119 --> 13:23.121
No one saw it.

13:23.622 --> 13:25.445
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:25.865 --> 13:27.829
Make a guess now while it is easy.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.792
Get your guess in early.

13:30.613 --> 13:36.463
Try and get your guess in for tonight, especially for tonight.

13:38.114 --> 13:42.461
And there are only 89 days more until Christmas.

13:42.482 --> 13:43.669
Put in Christmas.

13:43.868 --> 13:46.212
All of us will die today.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.077
Hail to Father Christmas.

13:49.097 --> 13:53.585
Old and young together say, Hail to Father Christmas.

13:54.145 --> 13:57.070
Bright the colored flax bits shine.

13:57.752 --> 14:00.096
Hail to Father Christmas.

14:00.116 --> 14:02.500
Bright today our love divine.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.607
Hail to Father Christmas.

14:06.627 --> 14:09.792
D plus one oh one oh nine.

14:09.772 --> 14:12.195
Hail to Father Christmas.

14:12.595 --> 14:15.939
Christmas minus ninety-nine.

14:15.959 --> 14:19.684
Hail to Father Christmas.

14:19.704 --> 14:21.946
Come, let's put it on the line.

14:22.367 --> 14:27.433
Hail to Father Christmas.

14:27.453 --> 14:37.264
No longer Christmas, and from this hill, bare top, its flanks covered with Christmas trees, many further hills are seen.

14:38.155 --> 14:47.748
So, Mary, now I love you straight and true and send you this to let you know that we had a rather sticky day today in the forest.

14:49.250 --> 14:59.404
Casualties were fairly heavy and a certain amount of battle fatigue, many more than there should be, but there are many contributing factors.

14:59.424 --> 15:02.408
I'm getting sort of mixed up on a lot of things again.

15:02.624 --> 15:04.727
but much clearer on others.

15:04.747 --> 15:07.330
It's very hard to write about this stuff.

15:07.350 --> 15:09.293
It is different from the boat.

15:09.313 --> 15:11.896
In the boat, we were always waiting for it.

15:11.916 --> 15:16.282
Here it is the happening all the time, and who it happens to.

15:16.302 --> 15:20.427
I do not think about me at all anymore, bragging again.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.970
I think about you, and that brings me in.

15:22.990 --> 15:28.758
I write you awfully dull letters, darling, because I get tired and sort of emptied out.

15:28.778 --> 15:31.922
And all I have to tell you that I can write is that I must have.

15:37.353 --> 15:45.963
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to be with you tonight and to discuss my new book.

15:47.886 --> 15:58.519
This is one of the things that I love to do most, and it gives me great pleasure that I can share it with all of you.

15:58.539 --> 16:03.765
The book came to me in a sort of a haze.

16:05.618 --> 16:07.881
Harry's Bar in Venice.

16:10.665 --> 16:32.453
Harry's Bar is a small place, but it is in effect a microcosm of all of that great and beautiful city which has been so well described by those writers Ruskin, Sinclair Lewis, Byron, and others.

16:33.952 --> 16:45.008
The hero, if he can be called a hero of this book, is a young colonel, 18 years old.

16:46.630 --> 16:58.968
He was made a colonel, no one knows quite how, and stationed in Trieste for his own sins.

16:58.988 --> 17:02.052
He is a fanatic at shooting at all things.

17:03.078 --> 17:06.543
including objects floating down the Grand Canal.

17:07.444 --> 17:16.537
And he has come to Venice to practice his, shall we say, avocation.

17:16.558 --> 17:32.781
In Venice, in Harry's Bar, which has become almost a sacred place to those of us who know it and who have enjoyed both the credit and the hospitality of Cipriani,

17:33.622 --> 17:43.515
An Italian, or rather, should we say, a Venetian countess, aged 86.

17:43.796 --> 17:52.628
In the corner of the room is a princess of Greece named Aspasia.

17:54.370 --> 18:03.122
The young colonel is mad about the princess of Greece, but still he has his countess and his obligations.

18:04.115 --> 18:32.046
The action of the book, ladies and gentlemen, only takes place during a period of 48 days, during which the colonel, who is continuously in Harry's bar, known to the local residents or indigentes,

18:32.853 --> 18:47.996
as Cipriani is continuously drunk due to his own efforts and his credit with Signor, speaking Italian, Cipriani.

18:48.837 --> 18:54.345
For 40 of these 48 days, the colonel is unable to find his countess.

18:55.707 --> 18:59.012
She has taken refuge in the Basilica.

19:00.663 --> 19:21.405
naturally she's given full facilities there and enjoys herself very much looking out of the upper windows and studying the action of the pigeons during this time of indecision for the young colonel who is on indefinite leave

19:23.444 --> 19:34.675
by the request of his superior officers, he makes the acquaintance of a beautiful Venetian maiden, aged no one knows what.

19:36.136 --> 19:44.204
Some say 16, some say 17, others, who are treacherous, say 18.

19:45.365 --> 19:50.430
She, through her powers of seductiveness,

19:51.085 --> 19:55.811
induces him to visit the island of Tornicello.

19:56.372 --> 20:13.373
The colonel is accompanied by his faithful black priest who is his spiritual advisor and can almost be regarded as his spiritual manager.

20:13.393 --> 20:19.000
Together they make a pilgrimage to this island

20:19.418 --> 20:33.974
A very ancient part of the lagoon which surrounds Venice.

20:33.994 --> 20:40.641
A town which I shall describe later after consulting my Baedeker.

20:41.903 --> 20:46.928
It is love at first sight between the colonel and Aftera.

20:47.752 --> 20:49.254
There is nothing to be done.

20:50.356 --> 20:54.603
It is a hopeless love, but much can come of it.

20:57.367 --> 21:08.545
And the Colonel takes advantage of this situation in a manner which might be criticized in certain circles.

21:10.955 --> 21:22.331
we will attempt to condone due to the presence of his faithful black priest, who at this moment has passed out.

21:22.351 --> 21:35.190
Aftera, or Aftera, as the name is pronounced by the local inhabitants, is indomitable.

21:35.210 --> 21:40.337
Nothing like her has been seen since Attila the Hun

21:41.752 --> 21:46.937
sat in the sacred chair of Tornicello.

21:48.139 --> 22:09.261
The colonel, who is an extremely devout Catholic, having only been expelled from the church at the age of 16, loves Aphtara as he has never loved anyone

22:09.983 --> 22:14.047
in all of his existence.

22:14.127 --> 22:20.113
Aftara loves him as she loves the front page of Europeo.

22:21.615 --> 22:23.877
What greater comparison can we make?

22:25.779 --> 22:39.012
God himself is absent for a time, probably on his own business, but he returns to Tornicello

22:39.835 --> 22:44.480
to bring happiness to these star-crossed lovers.

22:45.982 --> 22:50.527
Aftara and the Colonel Mary.

22:50.547 --> 22:57.074
But, ladies and gentlemen, there is tragedy in all of this.

22:58.996 --> 23:07.665
There is a tragedy that one can hardly say without having his voice break.

23:14.716 --> 23:22.403
a cardiac condition acquired during her youth.

23:22.423 --> 23:42.563
The colonel cannot stand to see her die, and so he himself swims off into the sunset, headed, as far as we know, toward Georgia, a fishing port.

23:46.559 --> 23:53.430
well down the coast, but the colonel can swim, and we hope that he can make it.

23:54.912 --> 24:13.242
This, in a quick resume, is the story of my new book, and I hope that everyone will buy it, paying $3, and the 20% of each of these $3 will go to me.

24:16.006 --> 24:38.128
to pay Gallareta and other people first, and then to go to the Fondación Aftera, which is to commemorate that great soul who has brought us such happiness.

24:38.148 --> 24:40.731
I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your patience.

25:00.421 --> 25:01.922
This is Ernest Hemingway.

25:03.424 --> 25:07.448
The fifth column was written in the fall and early winter of 1937.

25:07.548 --> 25:15.395
There were three major offensive projects for the Army of the Center that year.

25:16.416 --> 25:24.284
One of them was Brunetti, but had started brilliantly and ended in a very bloody and undecisive battle.

25:25.004 --> 25:27.607
And we were waiting for the first of the other two.

25:28.948 --> 25:29.989
They never came.

25:30.425 --> 25:32.929
But while we waited, I wrote the play.

25:35.213 --> 25:41.843
Each day we were shelled by the guns beyond Leganes and behind the folds of Garabitas Hill.

25:42.965 --> 25:52.380
And while I was writing the play, the Hotel Florida, where we lived and worked, was struck by more than 30 high-explosive shells.

25:53.482 --> 25:57.208
So if it is not a good play, perhaps that is what is the matter with it.

25:57.762 --> 26:04.209
If it is a good play, perhaps those 30-some shells helped write it.

26:04.229 --> 26:15.381
When you went to the front, at its closest it was 1,500 yards from the hotel, the play was always slipped inside the inner fold of a rolled-up mattress.

26:16.883 --> 26:21.728
When you came back and found the room and the play intact, you were always pleased.

26:22.737 --> 26:28.446
It was finished and copied and sent out of the country just before the taking of Paraguay.

26:28.466 --> 26:45.612
The title refers to the Spanish statement in the fall of 1936 that they had four columns advancing on Madrid and a fifth column of sympathizers inside the city to attack the defenders of the city from the rear.

26:46.853 --> 26:49.217
If many of the fifth column are now dead,

26:49.923 --> 26:58.792
must be realized that they were killed in a warfare where they were as dangerous and as determined as any of those who died in the other four columns.

27:00.854 --> 27:04.178
The four columns advancing on Madrid shot their prisoners.

27:05.279 --> 27:13.787
When members of the fifth column were captured inside the city in the early days of the war, they were also shot.

27:13.807 --> 27:14.428
Later,

27:14.948 --> 27:27.285
They were to be tried and given prison or labor camp sentences or sentenced to execution depending upon the crimes they had committed against the Republic.

27:27.306 --> 27:29.268
But in the early days they were shot.

27:30.810 --> 27:35.778
They deserved to be under the rules of war and they expected to be.

27:36.679 --> 27:43.909
Some fanatical defenders of the Spanish Republic and fanatics do not make good friends for a cause

27:44.665 --> 27:49.733
will criticize the play because it admits that fifth column members were shot.

27:50.894 --> 28:00.008
They will also say and have said that it does not present the nobility and dignity of the cause of the Spanish people.

28:00.950 --> 28:02.071
It does not attempt to.

28:03.173 --> 28:09.863
It will take many plays and novels to do that, and the best ones will be written after the war is over.

28:12.188 --> 28:16.192
This is only a play about counter-espionage in Madrid.

28:17.113 --> 28:28.904
It has the defects of having been written in wartime, and if it has a moral, it is that people who work for certain organizations have very little time for home life.

28:29.965 --> 28:36.791
There is a girl in it named Dorothy, but her name might also have been Nostalgia.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.934
Perhaps it would be best now for you to see it

28:40.319 --> 28:43.022
and for me to stop talking about it.

28:43.042 --> 28:49.128
But if being written under fire makes for defects, it may also give a certain vitality.

28:50.930 --> 28:55.314
You who see it will have a better perspective on this than I have.

28:58.377 --> 29:01.320
About the stories, there is not much to say.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.664
The first four are the last ones I have written.

29:05.545 --> 29:08.908
The others follow in the order in which they were originally published.

29:11.217 --> 29:15.664
The first one I wrote was up in Michigan, written in Paris in 1921.

29:15.744 --> 29:22.815
The last was Old Man at the Bridge, cabled from Barcelona in April of 1938.

29:25.099 --> 29:38.980
Beside the fifth column, I wrote The Killers, Today is Friday, Ten Indians, Part of the Sun Also Rises, and the first third of To Have and Have Not in Madrid.

29:39.837 --> 29:41.820
It was always a good place for working.

29:43.142 --> 29:57.967
So was Paris, and so were Key West Florida in the cool months, the ranch near Cook City, Montana, Kansas City, Chicago, Toronto, and Havana, Cuba.

29:57.987 --> 30:03.516
Some other places were not so good, but maybe we were not so good when we were in them.

30:10.398 --> 30:14.762
There was a long white beach with coconut palms behind it.

30:15.743 --> 30:26.553
The reef lay across the entrance of the harbor and the heavy east wind made the sea break on it so that the entrance was easy to see once you had opened it up.

30:27.594 --> 30:33.139
There was no one on the beach and the sand was so white that it hurt your eyes to look at it.

30:34.781 --> 30:37.323
The man on the flying bridge studied the shore.

30:38.084 --> 30:39.105
There were no shack

30:39.929 --> 30:45.977
where the shacks should have been, and there were no boats anchored in the lagoon that he could see.

30:47.699 --> 30:50.403
You've been in here before, he said to his mate.

30:50.964 --> 30:51.264
Yes.

30:52.466 --> 30:53.848
Weren't the shacks over there?

30:53.868 --> 30:57.633
They were over there, and it shows a village on a chart.

30:58.794 --> 31:02.359
They sure as hell aren't there now, the man said.

31:03.541 --> 31:05.844
Can you make out any boats up in the mangroves?

31:06.845 --> 31:08.367
There's nothing that I can see.

31:08.971 --> 31:11.554
I'm going to take her in and anchor, the man said.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.336
I know this cut.

31:13.797 --> 31:15.699
It's about eight times as deep as it looks.

31:17.121 --> 31:22.507
He looked down into the green water and saw the size of the shadow of his ship on the bottom.

31:24.009 --> 31:28.234
There's good holding ground east from where the village used to be, his mate said.

31:29.116 --> 31:29.396
I know.

31:30.077 --> 31:32.239
Break out the starboard anchor and stand by.

31:32.259 --> 31:33.941
I'm going to lay off there.

31:34.582 --> 31:37.746
With this wind blowing day and night, there will be no insects.

31:38.536 --> 31:38.998
No, sir.

31:40.222 --> 31:42.269
They anchored in the boat.

31:42.289 --> 31:47.888
She was not big enough to be called a ship except in the mind of the man who was her master.
