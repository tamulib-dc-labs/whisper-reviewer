WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.583
All right.

00:03.844 --> 00:09.851
One of the questions I had is, first of all, does everything fit in the new house?

00:09.991 --> 00:11.212
It doesn't.

00:11.553 --> 00:17.560
So what I've done is really put the best books in the apartment.

00:18.461 --> 00:22.926
I figured there's room for about 15,000 books, roughly, in the apartment.

00:22.946 --> 00:24.328
Really a fraction of what you had.

00:24.348 --> 00:25.729
Which was a fraction of what I had.

00:25.770 --> 00:32.097
The rest is still in storage, and I'm trying to decide what to do.

00:32.431 --> 00:33.753
about it at this point.

00:34.974 --> 00:52.594
For example, I've taken the authors who I know I want to continue to collect in depth, say Faulkner or Hemingway or Pynchon or whatever, I have just kept the really primary titles and all the secondary titles I'm going to keep and I'm going to have to keep those in storage.

00:53.455 --> 00:59.502
But I'm not going to keep all the authors, I mean all 6,000 authors that I've been collecting.

00:59.701 --> 01:01.985
ambitious premise.

01:02.065 --> 01:03.026
I couldn't handle it.

01:03.187 --> 01:04.769
I couldn't handle it, yeah.

01:04.789 --> 01:06.211
You're not defeated in any way.

01:06.312 --> 01:07.173
No, I'm not.

01:07.474 --> 01:10.959
It's just purely realistic, yeah.

01:10.979 --> 01:17.089
And I suppose if you had unlimited funds and staff to do it, you could keep up.

01:17.149 --> 01:25.202
But otherwise, it's certainly beyond my resources and time capacity.

01:26.380 --> 01:33.534
One of the burning questions I had, because when we were here a year and a half ago, you really weren't doing any, you were in a hiatus.

01:33.755 --> 01:34.556
Right, right, right.

01:34.817 --> 01:38.745
I think part of that had to do with the fact that you didn't have a place to put them.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.566
You didn't enjoy them.

01:39.687 --> 01:40.729
Right, right.

01:40.749 --> 01:42.933
But now we have this wonderful place.

01:43.414 --> 01:45.679
And I will never stop collecting.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.304
I'm just going to be much more selective.

01:48.976 --> 01:52.041
and more careful about it.

01:52.341 --> 01:53.202
So what happens then?

01:53.923 --> 02:01.755
Of the 6,000 authors which you previously had collected, how many would you say you brought to the new house with you?

02:01.775 --> 02:02.577
Oh, I never have done.

02:02.597 --> 02:04.079
I can probably get that number.

02:04.119 --> 02:05.862
Oh, I don't really even know.

02:09.968 --> 02:10.489
I don't know.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.051
I can get that number for you.

02:12.271 --> 02:14.715
Because, I mean, I've got a whole inventory.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.316
I just got them.

02:15.356 --> 02:16.738
Have you prepared a catalog?

02:17.157 --> 02:17.858
Not a catalog.

02:17.898 --> 02:28.232
I had the first appraisal done that I'd ever done since I started, and a book-by-book inventory in the department.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.315
Did you do this yourself?

02:30.695 --> 02:31.917
Well, I participated in it.

02:32.518 --> 02:38.325
A group of students, and this guy, Richard, who works for me, really sort of organized it.

02:38.345 --> 02:42.331
But I don't like anybody handling the books if I'm not there.

02:42.491 --> 02:43.392
You mentioned that before.

02:43.412 --> 02:44.093
In fact, you even...

02:44.782 --> 02:45.763
do the glassine.

02:45.863 --> 02:47.145
Yeah, that's therapy.

02:47.165 --> 02:48.526
I mean, that's just fun to do.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.928
That's kind of fun.

02:49.948 --> 02:54.754
How did you feel finally when you were able to, I mean, I knew instantly when I saw the Vogue takeoff.

02:54.774 --> 02:54.874
Yeah.

02:55.094 --> 02:55.915
That's why I called.

02:55.935 --> 02:56.416
I'm thrilled.

02:56.436 --> 02:57.257
It's spectacular.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.458
And people love the room.

02:58.538 --> 02:59.399
I mean, they just are.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.723
In fact, when I called, I said, I saw the piece in the Vogue.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.266
He said, how do you know that's his wife?

03:05.286 --> 03:05.747
I said, please.

03:05.767 --> 03:09.691
I said, there's only one person in America who owns these books.

03:09.711 --> 03:10.492
Right, exactly.

03:10.512 --> 03:13.776
I mean, you know, you don't have to be a physician to figure out out of Owen Armour's

03:14.195 --> 03:14.776
It's great.

03:15.316 --> 03:19.181
I can get it almost even though it's very high ceilings.

03:19.221 --> 03:22.725
You know, I can get things much more easily.

03:22.765 --> 03:25.989
And how are you enjoying the collection, though?

03:26.009 --> 03:26.530
Oh, I love it.

03:26.590 --> 03:30.595
It's just, it's... I mean, specifically, do you actually take things out?

03:30.735 --> 03:33.038
I don't absolutely take things out.

03:33.058 --> 03:34.440
Absolutely, absolutely.

03:34.460 --> 03:35.401
Play with them.

03:35.421 --> 03:36.963
Absolutely, absolutely.

03:38.805 --> 03:41.468
And, you know, that's the slightest excuse.

03:41.735 --> 03:42.796
try to show people things.

03:42.876 --> 03:46.059
I still think people are not very interested unless they are collectors.

03:46.079 --> 03:52.926
That's why I hope at some point that you'll show me this collection at some point.

03:53.787 --> 03:54.628
I don't know when.

03:55.969 --> 04:01.115
Well, when it went to a correspondent of my divorce, interestingly enough.

04:02.936 --> 04:06.600
I just had to get that in a little bit.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.121
That's all right.

04:07.221 --> 04:07.741
I don't mind.

04:07.761 --> 04:11.505
I hope it's not bad that he's my... No, no, that's all right.

04:12.160 --> 04:19.373
But what I would suggest is that we do it someday for, you know, at the end of the day for drinks and for a couple of hours.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.355
No, not at all.

04:21.076 --> 04:25.865
I just, I mean, the way Tammy's schedule just became impossible because I had to be here.

04:26.286 --> 04:27.027
She's not a collector.

04:27.228 --> 04:27.428
No.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.590
She doesn't understand that.

04:28.610 --> 04:29.251
She protects me.

04:29.311 --> 04:29.692
Exactly.

04:29.712 --> 04:30.914
There's a magic here.

04:30.995 --> 04:35.603
And I think, I hope I didn't express my disappointment too much.

04:36.106 --> 05:04.527
yeah yeah that's not a hurtful it was just scheduling what's been yeah i want to see this man right collection and uh i hope i'm not being too pushy on this no no but you can see this whole book by the way is is from scratch al dante i mean there's nothing nothing clip nothing paste right i flew out to omaha just to spend 15 minutes in that warehouse yeah

05:04.608 --> 05:06.830
I went to see Bill Scheide.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.712
You know, he bought the 36-line Bible.

05:08.732 --> 05:09.533
Did you know that?

05:09.553 --> 05:10.695
I didn't know that, yeah.

05:10.715 --> 05:16.040
He was the anonymous buyer of the... Well, now he owns six Gutenberg imprints.

05:16.861 --> 05:24.690
He's the only person, only the third person in history to have... So, anyway.

05:25.971 --> 05:28.834
So, you brought that... The Sinclair Lewis, yeah.

05:28.854 --> 05:29.915
Anything else at that stage?

05:30.135 --> 05:34.480
No, there was nothing else that, you know, in my field that I really needed that I didn't have.

05:34.696 --> 05:37.020
I would have bought something if I needed it.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.983
Any new authors that you've since started?

05:39.864 --> 05:42.228
No, I'm not starting any new authors for the moment.

05:44.191 --> 05:46.214
That's exactly what I don't want to get into.

05:49.279 --> 06:00.337
And I'm stopping spying, you know, writers who have really made it and who now have printings of 50,000 or 100,000 copies of their new novel.

06:00.397 --> 06:02.340
It's just not, there's really no point.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.942
What's your feeling on proofs now?

06:03.962 --> 06:04.944
Are you down on that?

06:04.964 --> 06:05.645
I'm down on that.

06:05.665 --> 06:06.266
I'm still down.

06:06.286 --> 06:08.129
I'm definitely down on that.

06:08.169 --> 06:10.913
Because, by the way, this is how I get proofs into my book.

06:10.973 --> 06:16.882
So you might just, can you tell me a little bit about what's led to your disillusionment on proofs?

06:16.902 --> 06:25.235
Well, I think it's the whole issue of being more rational and realistic about collecting.

06:25.295 --> 06:28.740
Proofs certainly have some value.

06:29.121 --> 06:30.403
They have some scarcity.

06:30.957 --> 06:47.581
But in practical terms, economic and space-wise, you know, unless you are Widener Library or the New York Public Library, I mean, there's no way you can... But do they actually constitute a variant of the text?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.305
That's why it would be... You know, sometimes it does.

06:50.585 --> 06:51.987
Sometimes it's quite significant.

06:52.456 --> 06:54.741
Witches of Eastwick, for instance.

06:54.961 --> 06:58.349
He made so many changes that they actually had to bring out a second set of proof.

06:58.369 --> 06:59.712
Right, right, exactly.

06:59.872 --> 07:00.914
So those are worth having.

07:00.934 --> 07:03.801
Those are worth having, absolutely.

07:03.821 --> 07:06.707
And how about those phony little sign-limited things?

07:07.829 --> 07:10.836
Unless it's a... Like with Applejack, you had to have 9,000... Right.

07:10.883 --> 07:14.268
I'm still collecting those for Updike and a few people, but, yeah.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.710
Because Updike, you're committed.

07:15.910 --> 07:17.994
Committed, exactly.

07:18.014 --> 07:18.634
You understand.

07:18.955 --> 07:19.536
You understand.

07:19.556 --> 07:23.622
I mean, there comes a point where I don't care for him so much anymore as a writer, let's say.

07:24.103 --> 07:24.203
Yeah.

07:24.223 --> 07:25.765
I think he's a very important writer.

07:25.785 --> 07:26.366
I do, too.

07:26.386 --> 07:32.074
I may name his in some other greats, but he's very important.

07:32.094 --> 07:32.996
I'm just saying, let's say.

07:33.276 --> 07:34.899
Right.

07:37.563 --> 07:40.587
All right, you had said before...

07:41.393 --> 07:49.184
You serve on the board with the Morgan, and you're very deeply involved with the New York Public, and you named one other institution.

07:49.204 --> 07:52.248
Well, I'm on the visiting committee at Harvard for the library, yeah.

07:52.468 --> 07:57.696
And you had said that maybe there's something I could do for them with some of these books.

07:57.876 --> 07:58.317
Right.

07:58.477 --> 07:59.318
Still very much.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.262
there's still something that you're thinking about.

08:01.282 --> 08:01.823
Absolutely.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.104
Yeah, absolutely.

08:03.124 --> 08:05.367
In terms of a specific kind of a collection.

08:05.407 --> 08:07.409
Well, that's what I have to work out.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.351
That's what I have to work out.

08:10.032 --> 08:21.245
You know, I did give my science fiction collection to the NYPL, which was, you know, as time goes on, it's quite a valuable, looks like quite a valuable gift.

08:22.206 --> 08:28.714
If there are ways in which I can supplement or strengthen these institutions,

08:29.521 --> 08:30.222
collections.

08:31.484 --> 08:32.505
That's what I wouldn't want to do.

08:33.527 --> 08:40.578
Morgan has not technically collected in the 20th century, but they are considering doing that.

08:41.499 --> 08:43.642
They have to raise more money.

08:43.682 --> 08:46.827
That opens up whole new... Exactly.

08:48.329 --> 08:50.673
But I would think very, very selectively if they did.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.896
And I think it would be primary theft.

08:53.264 --> 08:57.409
I don't think it would be printed books so much as it might be the Tennessee Williams collection.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:59.652 --> 09:01.814
Which is not something I want to give away right now.

09:01.934 --> 09:02.235
Anyway.

09:02.255 --> 09:03.797
I think it's very important.

09:03.817 --> 09:11.246
You know, I asked Louise, who's in her 40s, or how old she is, and had to say, what are you going to do with this?

09:11.266 --> 09:16.152
And she blinged her eyes like, well, I'm enjoying it.

09:16.172 --> 09:18.414
Pardon my delicacy, but I mean in the long run.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.398
She said, gee, you know, I hadn't...

09:22.238 --> 09:28.064
I get 25 years of serious collection and we'll think about it.

09:28.505 --> 09:32.229
That's what I think, and I can answer it even better.

09:32.389 --> 09:40.538
It depends on what percentage or how large a piece of my estate it represents.

09:41.659 --> 09:49.748
My first object is to leave as much money to my children and wife as possible.

09:50.167 --> 09:58.800
If I'm very successful in other kinds of investments and the books become a relatively small piece of my estate, then why not?

09:58.840 --> 10:00.683
It makes sense to give them to an institution.

10:01.705 --> 10:09.076
If they are a significant dollar asset, then I would want them sold so the kids could get the money.

10:09.336 --> 10:12.000
That's what Haskell Norman's going to do.

10:12.020 --> 10:15.906
Very simple, and until I die, I don't know the answer to that question.

10:15.926 --> 10:18.250
Okay, and I think that's the perfect answer, by the way.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.174
Shidey, for instance, is the third generation.

10:21.194 --> 10:26.102
His library, if any library is worth a hundred million dollars, it's his.

10:26.122 --> 10:27.183
He has everything.

10:27.724 --> 10:30.348
Literally everything that you can imagine.

10:30.428 --> 10:32.652
His daughter is a rare book librarian.

10:32.752 --> 10:36.879
She's married to a guy who's an assistant librarian.

10:36.899 --> 10:37.640
So they're book people.

10:38.421 --> 10:39.563
This is off the record.

10:39.583 --> 10:44.811
He won't tell you that it's going to Princeton, but off the record it is, because they can't afford

10:45.550 --> 10:46.892
Absolutely.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.057
They'd have to come up with $65 million in cash.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.881
Let's say it's a $100 million collection.

10:52.982 --> 10:56.727
They'd have to come up with $60 million roughly in cash.

10:56.747 --> 10:58.370
That's unspeakable, isn't it?

10:58.390 --> 10:59.031
It's ridiculous.

10:59.652 --> 11:01.495
How can you possibly keep something?

11:02.316 --> 11:02.797
You can't.

11:04.299 --> 11:11.170
The best you can do is let them keep a few things they really want.

11:11.572 --> 11:14.176
But unless you're just vastly rich, there's no way you can do it.

11:14.196 --> 11:25.633
What this means, you see, is that the last Gutenberg Bible of private hands will become part of the Princeton University, which is okay, but it's nice to be, he's a chapter by himself.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.477
He's a 19th century collector in the 1990s.

11:29.659 --> 11:39.013
He goes and he takes his Gutenberg Bible out, his 36-line Bible, his Blickling homily, which is the only Anglo-Saxon manuscript in America.

11:39.905 --> 11:42.408
You've got a fourth-century codex.

11:42.908 --> 11:44.590
It's better than the Morgan had.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.332
You got it through Mr. Krauss.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.735
It's the complete gospel according to Matthew.

11:48.755 --> 11:52.760
There's stuff in it that's not even in the... No, within 200 years of its composition.

11:53.681 --> 11:53.781
Yeah.

11:53.801 --> 11:54.121
Unbelievable.

11:54.141 --> 11:55.763
That's unbelievable.

11:55.883 --> 12:01.129
I think the more likely thing is that you're going to see more auctioning of material.

12:01.430 --> 12:01.990
Yeah.

12:02.010 --> 12:05.454
Because they've taken away the tax incentives for giving these things, too.

12:05.514 --> 12:06.115
Now, if you...

12:06.702 --> 12:15.874
If you paid $50,000 for your Gutenberg Bible, and it's now worth $2 million... They paid $45,000, and it's the only one, so it's probably worth $15 million, according to Stephen Mason.

12:15.914 --> 12:16.194
Really?

12:16.215 --> 12:20.280
It's in its original binding, and it's the last one that'll ever be sold.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.261
It could be worth $20 million.

12:21.281 --> 12:21.381
Yeah.

12:22.042 --> 12:26.708
You'd have to pay tax on his gain before taking a deduction.

12:26.768 --> 12:27.329
But his father bought it.

12:28.451 --> 12:31.214
Well, it's kind of... His father bought it from Rosenbach in 1920.

12:31.234 --> 12:33.317
I'm just telling you, there is no... It used to be...

12:34.090 --> 12:39.641
You could give that book to De Morgan and take a $15 million deduction.

12:40.182 --> 12:40.823
They won't let you do that.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.264
Can't do that.

12:42.126 --> 12:43.108
So they get you both ways.

12:43.128 --> 12:43.949
They get you both ways.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.077
So they screw you in terms of... It really is terrible.

12:48.137 --> 12:51.604
It's a change in 86 that they made, I think 85, 86.

12:51.865 --> 12:54.630
Stephen Massey says that a Gutenberg Bible now...

12:54.982 --> 12:57.565
The complete one, because there are none left.

12:57.585 --> 13:03.712
It would be the last one sold, although it's not unprecedented that an institution might want to raise money.

13:03.772 --> 13:04.413
The accession, yeah.

13:04.553 --> 13:10.660
Because the one that went over to Slipkart was sold by the General Theological Seminary here in New York.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.561
Right, right, right.

13:11.581 --> 13:12.221
So you never know.

13:12.642 --> 13:16.066
Listen, if you've got to hustle... I do, yeah.

13:16.106 --> 13:20.010
Let's do five more minutes.

13:21.256 --> 13:22.117
You know, I saw the pictures.

13:22.157 --> 13:24.359
I mean, does it replicate anything?

13:24.439 --> 13:26.821
No, those are just close-ups.

13:27.042 --> 13:27.662
I'd rather not.

13:27.702 --> 13:27.902
Yeah.

13:27.962 --> 13:30.064
I think it would disappoint me.

13:30.084 --> 13:31.306
I'm sure it's spectacular.

13:31.326 --> 13:32.106
It would disappoint you.

13:32.126 --> 13:34.749
So let's try and, if you can give me flexibility.

13:34.769 --> 13:36.410
What I didn't... I'll come at your pleasure.

13:36.671 --> 13:37.051
Okay.

13:37.351 --> 13:37.692
All right.

13:37.952 --> 13:40.995
Let's try and... I don't want you to make a special trip down.

13:41.055 --> 13:41.355
I will.

13:42.196 --> 13:42.736
Okay.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.018
That's no problem.

13:44.038 --> 13:46.200
This is part of the business.

13:46.340 --> 13:46.480
Right.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.041
You always pick up more.

13:48.062 --> 13:48.202
Okay.

13:48.362 --> 13:49.163
Okay.

13:49.223 --> 13:49.643
So let's...
