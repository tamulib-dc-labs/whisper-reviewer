WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:08.946
Wow, how are you doing?

00:15.175 --> 00:29.717
Isn't it great for the role?

00:32.785 --> 00:39.312
I'll talk a little bit if you like, or I'll just start, I'll answer your questions.

00:41.195 --> 00:43.838
Sometimes people want me to talk too.

00:43.858 --> 00:46.621
If you want me to talk, so.

00:46.641 --> 00:52.788
I graduated from here in 1960, and I can almost find my way around it.

00:52.808 --> 00:58.234
It's sort of the same and sort of different.

00:58.574 --> 01:01.678
I used to do biology labs in the field.

01:03.211 --> 01:05.033
So it's okay.

01:05.353 --> 01:06.715
And it seems really nice.

01:06.815 --> 01:10.218
I went back to my house.

01:10.239 --> 01:14.183
I lived in Barbary Lane in East Hills.

01:14.603 --> 01:24.654
And it's almost unrecognizable, because when I moved here, it was right after the Second World War, and all those houses were sort of sitting in mud.

01:24.814 --> 01:27.837
There was a lot of sunlight coming in.

01:27.897 --> 01:32.222
Now all the streets are shady, and it was really nice.

01:33.991 --> 01:42.799
When I left here, I went to Harvard, and my idea was to become a writer.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.822
And that was my goal.

01:45.862 --> 01:49.205
My dad was a journalist, but I didn't want to be a journalist.

01:49.225 --> 01:50.005
I wanted to write novels.

01:51.527 --> 02:01.956
And at some time during my college years, first I went to the English department, because I thought,

02:03.202 --> 02:04.644
You know, I have only very simple ideas.

02:05.145 --> 02:07.908
If you're going to be a writer, maybe you should go to the English department.

02:07.929 --> 02:12.495
And it turned out the English department really didn't have any interest in writers.

02:12.895 --> 02:21.087
And I was getting bad marks for my way of writing, which I was quite proud of.

02:21.748 --> 02:27.876
And decided, I guess, because I had a scientific benefit to do a sort of test.

02:28.750 --> 02:33.214
told someone that I was doing this because I didn't want to get thrown out.

02:33.795 --> 02:37.459
And I submitted an essay by George Orwell as my own.

02:39.561 --> 02:45.827
So I was getting C pluses, and George Orwell got a B minus.

02:45.847 --> 02:49.070
So it was clear that he was a better author than I was.

02:49.911 --> 02:56.698
But it still seems to me that if George Orwell, who I thought was a really wonderful writer, only got a B minus,

02:56.999 --> 03:05.775
I had a really interesting time.

03:06.316 --> 03:16.855
And in the course of that, I read somewhere that there were only 200 people in America who could make a living writing books full time.

03:17.576 --> 03:21.623
I have no idea if that's really true or not, but I thought, gee.

03:23.122 --> 03:34.074
It would be pretty hard to be one of 200 people in the whole country doing that.

03:34.094 --> 03:35.195
So I chickened out and went to medical school.

03:35.235 --> 03:43.985
Because I thought that would be a really interesting job and it would be really worthwhile, you know, and be helping people and creating lives.

03:44.125 --> 03:50.532
And it seemed kind of, you know, fast paced and changing a lot of people with technology and things like that.

03:50.712 --> 03:51.593
So I went on to medical school.

03:53.041 --> 04:08.262
And I had this situation, I had always paid part of my college education and so on working in the summers to be a lifeguard and things like that.

04:08.403 --> 04:14.070
And then I also did writing for the newspapers along my board.

04:15.753 --> 04:20.540
And so I had this habit of writing to make some money.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.322
And I began to write paperback books.

04:23.467 --> 04:28.153
in medical school to page my turnovers.

04:28.173 --> 04:29.155
And it was a big secret.

04:29.195 --> 04:29.755
Nobody knew.

04:30.977 --> 04:36.024
You know, because in medical school, a lot of your grade is personal assessment from your teachers.

04:36.044 --> 04:42.472
And I knew what they would think if they knew that I was writing.

04:42.492 --> 04:46.037
So, nobody ever knew.

04:46.057 --> 04:49.261
It's kind of the same as what they think now that they know I'm writing the UR.

04:49.281 --> 04:52.866
You know, it's just, they don't like it.

04:53.285 --> 04:57.431
It was a really interesting life.

04:57.672 --> 05:07.307
And all that happened was that it began to get more and more complicated because the books began to be successful.

05:07.327 --> 05:10.191
And at one point, I had written a book called A Case of Need.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.877
And somebody bought it in Hollywood to make a movie out of it.

05:13.897 --> 05:20.828
And they said, we want you to come to a little visual aid.

05:21.314 --> 05:23.917
I want you to come to Hollywood and talk to the screenwriter.

05:24.918 --> 05:25.919
And I said, I can't.

05:26.140 --> 05:26.740
You don't understand.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.363
I'm working in the hospital on .

05:29.383 --> 05:39.115
In those days, you went in at 5 o'clock in the morning, and you came out the following night, and more or less collapsed, and then got up and did it again.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.118
So I had no time to go to Hollywood.

05:42.138 --> 05:49.887
And they made those noises like, well, if you don't come, maybe you won't make a movie.

05:50.153 --> 05:54.898
And it didn't occur to me that I was really very unimportant in this process.

05:54.918 --> 05:56.439
So I thought I'd better try and go.

05:58.381 --> 06:05.689
And I had to get permission from the chief of medicine to leave for the weekend to get some days off.

06:07.170 --> 06:12.816
So I asked to speak to him and said I had a problem and needed some time off.

06:12.836 --> 06:16.920
And he asked me if there was illness in the family, which

06:17.710 --> 06:19.453
was the usual excuse.

06:19.473 --> 06:23.381
In medicine, you know, you do three months of orientation in one hospital, then you go to another hospital.

06:23.802 --> 06:32.819
So it was possible to have your grandmother die four or five times before the hospital, they didn't know.

06:32.939 --> 06:40.073
And I was so wound up that instead of saying yes, there was an illness in the family, I said no.

06:40.593 --> 06:50.547
It actually was something else that I'd written this novel and I'd sold it to Hollywood and they wanted me to fly out to California and talk to the screenwriter.

06:50.568 --> 06:54.493
He looked at me very solemnly and said, well, then you go.

06:55.294 --> 06:59.460
And he said, make sure you get a lot of rest.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.867
No one believed it.

07:04.047 --> 07:07.472
It was kind of crazy.

07:07.492 --> 07:08.794
And I went, you know, and I went.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.919
I was in a limousine and all this stuff, you know.

07:12.339 --> 07:17.245
I took off my white lab coat and got in a limousine.

07:17.265 --> 07:22.912
You know, and then I talked to all these people and ate all this fancy food in California.

07:22.932 --> 07:25.676
And then I came back and put on my lab coat and went back to work.

07:27.218 --> 07:30.302
You can't do that very long without going crazy.

07:30.322 --> 07:31.944
So I retired from medicine.

07:34.847 --> 07:38.612
Boy, this is a long story.

07:39.723 --> 07:44.049
I went to the Salk Institute after I graduated.

07:44.089 --> 07:54.403
My idea was that since I could live anywhere, I thought I want to live somewhere so I don't have to dig my car out of the snow.

07:54.423 --> 07:59.229
San Diego sounded very good, and Jonas Salk had started as a beautiful place.

07:59.530 --> 08:03.435
And he agreed to take me as a writer-in-residence.

08:03.455 --> 08:04.937
I was not going to be serious.

08:05.980 --> 08:09.966
A good thing, because everybody else in the history won the Nobel Prize.

08:10.688 --> 08:12.951
I was not up to it.

08:12.971 --> 08:15.736
It was really an interesting thing, though.

08:15.756 --> 08:26.613
So I could have these dinner parties, and you'd walk in, and there'd be 15 or 20 Nobel Prize meetings in the same room.

08:26.633 --> 08:27.755
A really bizarre experience.

08:27.775 --> 08:32.663
And prepares you very well for Hollywood, actually.

08:33.250 --> 08:41.277
In 1970, they were making a movie of this book I'd written called The Andromeda Spring.

08:41.297 --> 08:46.761
So I thought that I'd like to go and watch.

08:46.781 --> 08:48.483
Because I'd never actually seen a movie made.

08:48.503 --> 08:51.145
I thought that would be really interesting.

08:51.165 --> 08:53.567
And I went and watched and decided I wanted to do that.

08:53.727 --> 08:57.530
And never went back to .

08:57.550 --> 08:59.132
They just stayed there.

09:00.993 --> 09:03.055
And worked in movies.

09:05.296 --> 09:10.804
I think that I could probably keep talking like this, but it would be better if I stop now.

09:11.365 --> 09:18.375
I feel as though you've had an opportunity to get a look at me, and hear me, and not be able to hear me.

09:18.395 --> 09:23.783
And so why don't I talk about the funeral?

09:23.803 --> 09:26.628
I can't believe you're in trouble.

09:26.968 --> 09:31.755
Did you ever imagine, when you first wrote Jurassic Park, that it would eventually become the highest living room of all time?

09:33.357 --> 09:35.100
Did you hear the question?

09:35.654 --> 09:39.298
Especially, did I and I have to do the highest prices in the fourth time?

09:39.478 --> 09:40.439
No, absolutely not.

09:40.600 --> 09:47.708
I didn't think anyone would make it, you know, because it was very, very expensive.

09:47.728 --> 09:54.956
And it was just, it came out just at the time when everybody was saying movies cost too much, we're going to spend less, and, you know, we're not going to do that.

09:54.976 --> 09:57.359
And I thought, oh no, this is a dinosaur movie.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.582
You don't have to bring in truckloads of money.

10:00.602 --> 10:03.045
And so I didn't think anyone would make it.

10:03.785 --> 10:11.776
And then when Steven bought it, Steven Spielberg, the thing about Steven Spielberg is you never know what will happen, you know, realistically.

10:11.796 --> 10:14.279
I mean, he very much does what he wants to do.

10:14.299 --> 10:18.926
And of course, he bought VR, you know, but then he didn't do that.

10:19.486 --> 10:23.552
And then he bought Jurassic Park and then he went off and did Hook.

10:23.572 --> 10:29.019
So who knew if it would ever get made?

10:29.039 --> 10:33.285
What happened was I went to visit them when they were shooting in Kauai.

10:33.552 --> 10:34.854
It was like the first two weeks.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.518
And he was in a very good mood.

10:38.079 --> 10:39.701
And he was sort of lining up shots.

10:39.721 --> 10:42.025
And it's very, very fun to watch.

10:42.145 --> 10:48.114
It's really interesting because he lines up every shot by himself.

10:48.455 --> 10:49.657
And you can watch him video.

10:49.997 --> 10:57.889
And the first time you put the shot out and it's really bled out, you look at it and think, hmm, that's good.

10:58.105 --> 11:08.236
And then he gets behind a camera, he moves this here, he shifts that there, he changes the action, he moves the light, and you look at it again, it's better.

11:08.256 --> 11:13.542
And then he does the thing, you know, and suddenly it just pops, you know, and you go, wow, look at that.

11:13.562 --> 11:15.784
And he says it again and again, all day long.

11:18.807 --> 11:19.248
He's a genius.

11:19.348 --> 11:22.812
And so it's really fun to be there.

11:22.832 --> 11:27.657
But he said, you know, all the people wanted you

11:28.109 --> 11:35.240
is have fun and believe the dinosaurs are real.

11:35.380 --> 11:47.158
And I walked in and thought, you know, this could be a very big movie, if that's what it does.

11:47.178 --> 11:55.230
There have been a lot of work circulating about why you've never eventually robbed a new book, and that you have some sort of falling out of the initiative.

11:56.425 --> 12:03.739
I have no idea what it is.

12:03.759 --> 12:05.362
Is there a rumor that I don't make some rumors?

12:05.382 --> 12:05.963
Yeah, I'm like, yeah.

12:05.983 --> 12:13.337
I was falling out with a year and a year and a year and a year and a year and a year.

12:13.317 --> 12:17.644
No, I've always watched it.

12:17.885 --> 12:22.332
I have to wonder if you do this at all.

12:22.352 --> 12:23.054
I don't know.

12:23.074 --> 12:24.756
You know, there's a lot of rumors.

12:24.777 --> 12:29.124
For a long time, people have been calling up and saying, how are you feeling?

12:29.825 --> 12:32.309
And this is the way it says it.

12:32.329 --> 12:35.234
And finally, I started asking, why are you next to me?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.496
And it turned out there was these rumors that I was dying.

12:36.516 --> 12:37.418
No, I don't know what that is.

12:38.174 --> 12:58.665
When you get ready to write a book, such as Congo, how much time do you spend researching this to make sure that your story is super active, super active?

12:58.685 --> 13:01.929
I used to say that I didn't do any research, and I finally concluded that it couldn't be true.

13:02.050 --> 13:04.333
And I think the answer is that I...

13:05.123 --> 13:11.354
think about a project for a long time, and I cook articles, and I prepare.

13:11.374 --> 13:20.349
So by the time I actually begin, I have a lot of information.

13:20.369 --> 13:25.177
And then after it's done, during the time of writing, it's actually a very little research.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.541
Sometimes I want a fact or an idea.

13:27.561 --> 13:30.827
I often go to maps because I don't want the name of a town.

13:31.499 --> 13:34.302
And then it sounds good.

13:34.402 --> 13:37.846
Get the math out and find it.

13:37.866 --> 13:40.229
You can't make the wrong very well.

13:40.429 --> 13:50.780
And then they extend the fact-checking at the end of .

13:50.800 --> 13:54.805
Are you planning on making a lot more ?

13:54.825 --> 13:55.165
I'm not.

13:55.325 --> 13:59.190
Steven Spielberg is.

13:59.210 --> 14:00.291
Yes, he's working on it now.

14:00.473 --> 14:04.579
He's announced it for the summer of 1997.

14:09.627 --> 14:13.953
It's a really good question.

14:20.123 --> 14:27.834
Sometimes these numbers are published in places like Ford's Magazine, and I'm astonished.

14:27.854 --> 14:29.637
And I don't know if they're right or not.

14:30.410 --> 14:36.398
I once had a letter to Forbes and said, listen, I think you're really wrong, but I know you want to be German to be accurate.

14:36.418 --> 14:40.504
So in case you've made a terrible mistake about how much I'm making, will you make up the difference?

14:42.647 --> 14:43.808
They didn't answer back.

14:44.049 --> 14:51.439
I'm very bad about, I don't know.

14:52.617 --> 15:08.075
You know, I'm doing fine, but I don't know those things, and I don't know, for example, people often say to me, well, what kind of contractual rights do you have?

15:08.175 --> 15:13.201
You know, on VR, do you have the right to tell them what to do if you don't like what's going on?

15:13.662 --> 15:14.202
I don't know.

15:15.324 --> 15:20.650
I don't know what the situation is, because I just try and stay focused on the work.

15:21.828 --> 15:30.279
You know, I mean, I am aware that I'm a lot more successful than I was 10 years ago, you know, but I don't know if that works.

15:30.299 --> 15:30.640
I don't count it.

15:34.585 --> 15:52.384
Right in the left.

15:52.404 --> 15:52.624
Okay.

15:52.644 --> 16:01.733
I was wondering how you got to be still up on some trends.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.314
You're willing to hear that?

16:02.429 --> 16:10.001
Sometimes I get to repeat the question and think of the answers.

16:10.021 --> 16:17.193
One of the nice things for me is to be able to go into an area and just read for a long time.

16:19.256 --> 16:28.791
I used to think that in a way the nature of my life was that I get to go do the research, which is the fun part, and then the penalty phase is you have to go write a book.

16:29.429 --> 16:32.192
And it's really sort of how I think about it.

16:32.212 --> 16:35.496
I mean, it's a weird thing.

16:36.297 --> 16:39.360
There was a book by James Bly called Chaos.

16:41.503 --> 16:44.586
And a friend of mine had read it and said, have you read this book?

16:44.606 --> 16:46.088
It's really difficult.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.469
I don't understand it at all.

16:47.850 --> 16:51.153
So I went and read it and I thought, well, this is really not so difficult.

16:52.655 --> 16:58.862
And I decided to put it in Jurassic Park as a sort of easy explanation because I thought,

16:59.483 --> 17:01.445
he at least should understand about it.

17:03.929 --> 17:07.193
I feel very lucky that I can just follow up and interest me.

17:08.975 --> 17:24.715
You know, right now the thing that interests me a lot is, and it's based on things like the Menendez trial, is the question of what actually causes our behavior, how we think about our behavior.

17:25.808 --> 17:32.858
You know, if we are abused as children, does that mean that we are inevitably going to grow up and blow our parents' brains out?

17:33.459 --> 17:35.422
You know, do we have a choice?

17:37.064 --> 17:51.124
I once had a driver on a movie that I was working on, and this man, who is now in his thirties, was the only survivor of a mass murder of his entire family.

17:51.695 --> 18:04.874
All of his brothers and sisters and family had died and he survived because his siblings fell dead on him and covered him and the killer didn't realize that he was still alive.

18:06.536 --> 18:13.887
The nicest person you'd ever know, you know, this really sweet guy who had this horrible life experience.

18:13.907 --> 18:21.077
So what exactly is the relationship between our life experiences and our genetic makeup and how we eventually come to behave?

18:21.327 --> 18:24.132
I think there's huge confusion about that in our society.

18:24.533 --> 18:25.955
And there's huge confusion in me.

18:26.055 --> 18:27.358
I don't understand very well.

18:27.478 --> 18:36.013
So I'm off reading now John Stuart Mill and On Liberty and all these books that I've never read before because I don't know a lot.

18:36.033 --> 18:45.310
And it's really interesting to find.

18:45.577 --> 18:57.589
Where do the ideas come from?

18:57.809 --> 19:00.132
I have a little guy who walks around.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.833
He's very short.

19:02.494 --> 19:02.954
I don't know.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.259
You know, if I knew where they come from, I would have more.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.567
But one thing is, I have these curiosities.

19:17.437 --> 19:21.723
And I don't know why I'm curious about things, but I'm curious about them.

19:23.465 --> 19:28.651
Or I have these questions, like, what causes behavior?

19:29.973 --> 19:31.235
Does anybody know?

19:32.256 --> 19:33.818
Do we accept Freudian ideas?

19:33.838 --> 19:35.460
Do we accept other kinds of ideas?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.424
Where do we lay responsibility for behavior?

19:38.724 --> 19:41.348
Are you responsible for behavior no matter what?

19:43.090 --> 19:44.592
Are you always responsible?

19:44.825 --> 19:51.832
Or can there be some life experiences that are so horrible and distorting that we say, okay, you're not responsible.

19:51.852 --> 19:54.254
You have been so ripped apart.

19:54.515 --> 19:55.816
How do we make those distinctions?

19:55.856 --> 19:56.937
How do we draw those lines?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.338
What do we really think?

19:59.680 --> 20:03.544
I don't know why I'm interested in that, but I am.

20:07.027 --> 20:08.909
Oh, you have a sec, part two?

20:08.929 --> 20:10.090
Okay, go ahead.

20:10.357 --> 20:28.983
It would be a long explanation.

20:31.407 --> 20:35.132
It's from a computer program, and we can talk about it later.

20:36.294 --> 20:39.418
But it's really meant to just sort of give you a visual

20:41.693 --> 20:51.062
suggestion of what these chaotic ideas are about, you know, getting closer to the edge of chaos and having systems collapse.

20:52.243 --> 20:58.790
To try and make an image that suggests that, please.

20:58.810 --> 20:58.890
Yes?

20:58.910 --> 21:04.375
A lot of times people will watch a movie and say it was nothing compared to, like, the book that it was based on.

21:04.395 --> 21:08.139
How do you feel like movies have, like, your movies reflected your writing?

21:08.179 --> 21:11.042
Do you feel like they captured the essence of what you wanted to get across?

21:12.288 --> 21:15.813
It depends on the movie, but very often I'm happy about the movie.

21:17.656 --> 21:25.588
You know, one of the really sobering things that can happen is that you get to make the movie of your own book and you don't do it very well.

21:26.370 --> 21:32.699
I did a book, a movie called The Great Train Robber with Sean Connery in the late 70s.

21:32.900 --> 21:37.066
And it was my book and my screenplay and my direction.

21:37.787 --> 21:39.730
And when it was all done, I thought, you know,

21:40.334 --> 21:42.136
I really made some terrible mistakes.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.517
I didn't, you know, it shouldn't have been that long.

21:44.998 --> 21:48.822
So that tends to make you a lot more sympathetic toward other people.

21:50.283 --> 21:59.272
But I'm not always sympathetic.

21:59.472 --> 22:06.118
My favorite book is called Travels, and I think it's because it's about me.

22:06.278 --> 22:09.261
You know, I mean, I think that

22:10.810 --> 22:16.976
It's a purely egotistical thing that, you know, a whole book about me.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.660
And I really want to go on.

22:24.324 --> 22:33.674
What exactly is ER being done in our book that you read and wrote one time?

22:33.694 --> 22:40.581
Originally, ER is based on experiences that I had had in the emergency room in Massachusetts General Hospital.

22:41.843 --> 22:46.067
when it had this long history and no one would make it.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.629
Eventually, Steven Spielberg bought it.

22:49.291 --> 22:54.716
And we had talked about changes because he was at one time going to direct it as a movie.

22:54.736 --> 22:58.580
So it had been a long time since I met the Mass General.

22:58.600 --> 23:03.205
And I sent it to them and said, I've written this thing and I want to revise it.

23:03.225 --> 23:05.528
Is there all right if I come back to the emergency room?

23:05.628 --> 23:06.849
And they said, absolutely not.

23:07.149 --> 23:10.753
You cannot come anywhere near here unless you

23:11.408 --> 23:12.990
said it somewhere else.

23:13.691 --> 23:16.154
And I thought, why would I go away to Boston and said it somewhere else?

23:16.174 --> 23:18.458
So I never went back.

23:18.478 --> 23:24.185
But it was all based on true incidents, and people remember them.

23:24.486 --> 23:37.944
You know, in the pilot, Harold Hathaway, the nurse who attempted suicide, and it was very serious, and all two things.

23:37.964 --> 23:39.306
Do you think the arms would be as big as it comes down to the first

23:42.273 --> 23:49.062
I think we are a big, big of a big thing.

23:49.082 --> 23:51.085
You know, it was this screenplay that nobody liked.

23:52.347 --> 23:58.796
And I always thought, just make it, it'll be terrific.

23:58.816 --> 24:01.960
So I had that confidence always.

24:01.980 --> 24:08.810
And they used to have many people who would say, well, you have to change this, you have to change that.

24:08.830 --> 24:09.310
And I wouldn't.

24:09.330 --> 24:11.233
You know, I was passing the rest of it, and I just refused to do it.

24:12.732 --> 24:17.419
So I have that confidence.

24:17.439 --> 24:30.738
But the question of whether or not it's going to draw an enormous audience at the beach is another question.

24:30.758 --> 24:31.479
I have no idea of the quality of it.

24:31.499 --> 24:37.427
I read the point in the comment that you think that you're planning your book to create the interest file.

24:37.447 --> 24:39.210
You started writing that?

24:39.230 --> 24:39.430
I'm sorry.

24:39.450 --> 24:40.191
My editor asked me something.

24:41.048 --> 24:52.047
Because of changes in technology, you can now publish very rapidly.

24:52.067 --> 24:58.137
So I only finished this book, really finished it about eight or nine months ago.

24:58.157 --> 25:05.149
And I think it's really unseemly of my editor to ask for the next one.

25:05.973 --> 25:17.627
You know, they did.

25:18.929 --> 25:20.411
I was really encouraged.

25:20.611 --> 25:33.567
And I feel really, really lucky, you know, when I look back about, and it's not just because some of them are here.

25:33.901 --> 25:42.374
I really feel like I had this blessed upbringing.

25:42.394 --> 25:49.325
I had teachers that, because I have some of those papers, and essays, and short stories, and they're awful.

25:51.629 --> 25:58.660
You know, someone wanted to publish a book of early life called Juvenilius,

25:59.011 --> 26:02.855
of American writers, and so they asked me for some of mine, and I went back.

26:02.915 --> 26:06.580
And I still have things in the next grade.

26:06.600 --> 26:11.966
And I looked through them, and they were just terrible.

26:12.046 --> 26:13.387
And there's a lot out of it.

26:13.608 --> 26:14.428
I really wrote a lot.

26:15.530 --> 26:22.858
So somebody had to read all that week after week and comment on it and encourage me, and that happened.

26:23.243 --> 26:39.028
I don't know.

26:39.048 --> 26:47.021
But I think it's better to be a curse than a curse.

26:47.041 --> 26:48.323
What's your book during your meeting?

26:51.695 --> 27:02.345
You know, I was always really interested in architecture.

27:02.365 --> 27:07.470
And in fact, all the time I was doing medicine, I liked medicine, okay, but I had some problems.

27:07.570 --> 27:11.254
I was sick of the side of blood and things like that.

27:11.274 --> 27:11.835
It was awkward.

27:13.837 --> 27:17.120
But I really admired architecture at that time.

27:17.140 --> 27:20.503
I think I might have tried to become an architect.

27:24.955 --> 27:35.429
I like to hike a lot.

27:36.911 --> 27:41.557
I like to get into as much of a wilderness area as I can.

27:43.199 --> 27:45.802
I used to scuba dive a lot, but I don't do it anymore.

27:45.822 --> 27:49.427
I had a lot of interest in sort of daredevil things.

27:50.774 --> 27:57.924
you know, risk these sorts of things and would occasionally get into trouble, you know, very high or very low in the world.

27:58.084 --> 28:02.209
And I don't do that anymore.

28:02.229 --> 28:03.932
I have a child.

28:07.717 --> 28:08.177
I'm responding to that.

28:08.197 --> 28:09.559
How helpful is that information that you learned in medical school ?

28:12.982 --> 28:17.548
It's not too helpful anymore, you know, because it's all wrong.

28:17.568 --> 28:29.144
You know, they used to tell you that the speed of change and knowledge of medicine is so fast, they say, we've been here for four years, so by the time you graduate, 25% of what you've been taught is wrong.

28:30.026 --> 28:32.048
And I've been out a quarter of a century, so it's all wrong.

28:32.489 --> 28:32.910
This is wrong.

28:32.930 --> 28:34.111
Well, I think that's a great thing.

28:34.131 --> 28:41.942
I think that's a great thing.

28:43.508 --> 28:49.877
Why did I write the Patreon Army?

28:49.897 --> 29:02.874
You know, there was a reason, and it's, you know, I've learned a lot over the years, but at that time, there was a study that had been done in New York about muggers.

29:02.894 --> 29:13.448
And the study showed that the muggers were not primarily drug addicts or people who were in some kind of dire strait.

29:13.630 --> 29:17.415
But there was this professional class of muggers, you know, people who did this for a living.

29:19.077 --> 29:21.299
And it shocked New York.

29:23.202 --> 29:25.424
This was maybe 73, 74, something like that.

29:25.925 --> 29:32.653
And I thought, well, that's really interesting, you know, this idea of a professional criminal class with people who do different work, you know.

29:33.674 --> 29:35.997
Some people are cognitive, some people are criminals.

29:37.038 --> 29:42.405
And I went, I started going back, tracking it backwards to where the origins of this idea

29:42.740 --> 29:49.767
came, and I discovered that there had been, in 1835, this very interesting train robbery.

29:49.787 --> 29:50.228
Trains were new.

29:50.708 --> 29:53.231
Somebody had robbed a train.

29:53.251 --> 29:56.454
And it was quite a shocking sort of discovery.

29:56.534 --> 30:08.627
And I wrote about that as a way to try and talk about what was happening now, but no one ever made a connection.

30:08.647 --> 30:10.789
I don't think he's on that train robbery, but are all the characters, like when he died, are they all real?

30:12.237 --> 30:14.300
Those are the people.

30:15.241 --> 30:18.765
But where nothing is known, I did it.

30:20.387 --> 30:21.909
You know, it's the same thing with the dinosaurs.

30:21.929 --> 30:24.552
Nobody really knows how the dinosaurs look and behave.

30:25.494 --> 30:28.157
But if you're going to do that story, you're going to have to do it.

30:28.197 --> 30:29.579
So I do it.

30:32.462 --> 30:36.087
A lot of your books have a common theme of technology running out of control.

30:36.107 --> 30:38.650
Is that where you think we're headed as a society?

30:43.372 --> 30:44.473
I don't know how to tell you this.

30:44.633 --> 30:45.794
I don't know where we're headed.

30:45.814 --> 31:04.072
One of the smartest people that I've ever come across is Arthur Clarke, who has a really wide range of knowledge about a lot of different types of disciplines.

31:04.092 --> 31:06.394
And he wrote a book called Profiles of the Future.

31:07.295 --> 31:12.400
And he guessed where all kinds of technologies could go.

31:12.683 --> 31:14.245
up until 2020 or 2050.

31:16.108 --> 31:21.015
And you look at that, and he did it in 1968, it's very wrong.

31:22.638 --> 31:25.862
I mean, he really missed a lot of stuff.

31:25.902 --> 31:36.598
And major defining things, for example, that someone would go and put a computer on a microchip, and that these would now be very cheap and they would be everywhere.

31:36.950 --> 31:41.836
Now they're on desktops, they're in thermostats, they're in automobiles, they're all over the place.

31:41.916 --> 31:42.838
No one knew that.

31:43.238 --> 31:46.963
You know, you didn't, couldn't guess it.

31:47.464 --> 31:55.174
An illness like AIDS, it would have worldwide effects, absolutely unanticipated.

31:55.194 --> 31:56.235
So all these things happened.

31:56.255 --> 32:03.224
They completely changed the course of everything and no one can predict it.

32:03.244 --> 32:03.965
I don't know what's going to happen.

32:03.985 --> 32:05.387
Do you feel that like it was going up to the AIDS community or others?

32:05.975 --> 32:08.279
Arthur Conan Doyle was my favorite author.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.926
I was a very stubborn reader of fiction.

32:12.966 --> 32:15.810
My friends gave me to read it.

32:15.830 --> 32:22.360
But in my defense, they were choosing the books for me to read.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.583
And they were really weird books.

32:24.964 --> 32:30.312
To ask a teenager at Robinson High School to read

32:31.000 --> 32:36.927
You said, has anybody here read Morning Doom?

32:36.947 --> 32:46.799
Yeah, well, you know, I was paid, I forget, one or two dollars to read the book, and I earned it, I can tell you.

32:46.819 --> 32:57.312
Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes story, through the first book that I read, I read a lot of nonfiction books.

32:59.198 --> 33:05.927
Right.

33:05.947 --> 33:07.970
You have to write a lot.

33:10.133 --> 33:17.142
And the reason for doing that is you get, I mean, it's a very weird line, you know, and it's not for everybody.

33:18.604 --> 33:21.208
So by doing that, you'll find out if it's for you.

33:22.690 --> 33:28.918
And you'll also get all the baloney out of your system.

33:29.573 --> 33:37.221
Where do you write?

33:37.441 --> 33:40.585
I have an office.

33:40.605 --> 33:48.073
I get up in the morning, I get my time, I drive to my office, and it's like a very good job.

33:48.233 --> 33:55.280
And I sit at the desk and I write from the morning.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.982
Actually, I write early in the morning usually.

33:58.126 --> 34:08.481
I'm working for about noon, and then I'm done, and then I do.

34:08.501 --> 34:16.112
So we seem to think that's in the mail in the afternoon.

34:16.132 --> 34:16.412
It's a job.

34:16.432 --> 34:20.218
How much time goes into it?

34:20.278 --> 34:20.999
How much time goes into it?

34:21.019 --> 34:23.222
I can't tell you, because there's all this time of thinking.

34:24.805 --> 34:33.033
before you start, which is usually this year and sometimes five years, sometimes a lot longer.

34:33.133 --> 34:49.689
But the actual writing time, well, I started Louis World on the end of October last year, started actually writing.

34:49.709 --> 34:53.212
And I finished in sometime in July.

34:53.232 --> 34:53.412
Finished.

34:54.269 --> 35:06.664
How long was that?

35:06.764 --> 35:07.044
Eight months?

35:07.144 --> 35:07.505
Too long.

35:07.525 --> 35:07.705
Too long.

35:08.086 --> 35:15.875
Did you find it more difficult to write the boss world than it was to write the original track?

35:15.895 --> 35:20.200
Of course, is it more difficult to write the sequel than the original?

35:20.280 --> 35:21.081
The answer, oddly enough, is no.

35:21.101 --> 35:23.584
The first book was so difficult to write that

35:24.155 --> 35:25.076
This is a snap.

35:28.040 --> 35:34.209
There's a weird thing about the first book, which is that it was originally written from the standpoint of the kids.

35:35.871 --> 35:40.617
And I gave it to people to read it, and everybody hated it.

35:40.637 --> 35:44.803
You know, there's a certain kind of reaction you get sometimes to your work.

35:44.963 --> 35:47.366
Somebody says, well, it's not very good, or well.

35:47.387 --> 35:48.508
People hated it.

35:49.990 --> 35:54.555
I would feel them want to throw the manuscript back in my face.

35:54.915 --> 36:00.121
I would get questions like, why did you write this book?

36:00.141 --> 36:01.983
It's not hopeful for the future.

36:04.246 --> 36:16.018
And it took me a long time before finally somebody said to me, you know, it's told from the standpoint that I wanted it to read it for me.

36:16.239 --> 36:19.322
And I thought, oh, it's adult.

36:20.534 --> 36:22.878
It's fantasy for adults.

36:22.898 --> 36:30.813
And so I made the adult characters more important than the kids, and then everyone thought, this is great.

36:30.833 --> 36:36.984
Before you start writing a book, do you have, like, all the secrets of this play now?

36:37.004 --> 36:38.767
No.

36:38.788 --> 36:39.108
I don't.

36:39.208 --> 36:43.977
I have a general plan, and I don't have a specific novel.

36:47.247 --> 36:57.178
I hope I'm improving.

36:57.198 --> 37:02.764
I worry about that, you know.

37:02.784 --> 37:11.613
Sometimes... I never had... See, I always thought that when you got to be about 21, then your life was sort of over.

37:11.633 --> 37:16.258
I mean, because you could see when you were younger, when you were...

37:16.424 --> 37:20.909
your age, you can see, you know, each year by year, people look different, you know, right?

37:21.309 --> 37:22.211
I mean, things happen.

37:22.251 --> 37:26.055
Shoulders get bigger, other things get bigger.

37:26.135 --> 37:29.439
And I thought, well, you know, so there's that development.

37:29.459 --> 37:33.944
And then around 21, it stops, and you're kind of the same until you die.

37:34.044 --> 37:44.035
Your hair gets, you know, pulled out and, you know, you get crabby and weak and stuff.

37:45.247 --> 37:55.500
I didn't have any idea that there would be continuing changes just as there went through adolescence, which is my experience of adulthood.

37:56.381 --> 38:06.774
So what happens is that sometimes I really feel as though I don't really have anything to, I have no interest or nothing I want to write.

38:08.136 --> 38:10.219
It's a very desolate feeling.

38:10.239 --> 38:12.942
And that's more awful than

38:14.204 --> 38:17.649
Can I get some water?

38:17.669 --> 38:20.213
Is there any water in here?

38:20.233 --> 38:22.496
Yes.

38:22.757 --> 38:27.564
Sorry.

38:27.644 --> 38:40.363
You guys are holding up very well.

38:41.930 --> 39:11.803
If I could change anything that I've done.

39:11.823 --> 39:11.903
Huh.

39:12.271 --> 39:14.814
You know, thanks very much.

39:16.756 --> 39:26.869
Some of the stuff that becomes philosophical, I tend not to have regret.

39:27.670 --> 39:37.562
You know, I've done some really stupid things and I've wasted a lot of time in my life and I've behaved badly and I've been married a lot.

39:38.242 --> 39:38.903
What is a lot?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.405
Four times.

39:40.790 --> 39:45.795
Now listen, that's sort of like okay if Hollywood, you know.

39:46.916 --> 39:48.318
That's like low normal.

39:49.239 --> 39:54.344
Three is about the average, so you're a little above average.

39:57.067 --> 39:58.548
Only one in my present marriage.

40:00.470 --> 40:04.354
That's the thing I'm pleased about.

40:04.655 --> 40:07.978
But I tend to think, well, that's what happened, you know.

40:08.482 --> 40:13.772
I do the best I can, and it's not always so great.

40:16.036 --> 40:21.647
Do you enjoy these things?

40:21.667 --> 40:22.108
I enjoy these things.

40:22.749 --> 40:25.194
You know, you could probably miss her.

40:25.214 --> 40:28.600
It's a real mixed bag, you know.

40:29.086 --> 40:37.260
You asked me about the money, didn't you?

40:37.300 --> 40:40.065
Listen, here's the answer.

40:40.245 --> 40:47.217
You know, Joe Lewis was once asked about this and he said, I've been rich and I've been poor and rich is better.

40:47.237 --> 40:50.242
That's one answer, right?

40:50.262 --> 40:55.110
The other answer is, it's very nice

40:55.968 --> 41:01.573
You know, you can usually get a table in a restaurant and all that stuff, you know, or a reservation.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.938
Come back to your high school and everybody will talk to you and act like you're an important person.

41:06.958 --> 41:11.963
That's all really nice.

41:11.983 --> 41:15.727
The other thing is that you're never left alone, you know.

41:16.708 --> 41:20.071
You have to have really good table manners because someone's always watching.

41:20.091 --> 41:24.675
There's none of this stuff, you know, because they're all looking at you.

41:25.600 --> 41:30.505
At a certain point in my life, I realized that I was going to have people watch me eat.

41:32.567 --> 41:35.350
And it's weird.

41:35.370 --> 41:36.531
It's just weird.

41:36.571 --> 41:37.892
You're eating and they're watching.

41:39.214 --> 41:39.474
Michael?

41:40.735 --> 41:42.076
I just have one announcement to make.

41:42.197 --> 41:43.318
I'm Paul Bogards.

41:43.438 --> 41:45.600
I'm from Michael's publisher, Knopf.

41:45.620 --> 41:51.726
And the first announcement I'd like to make, actually, is I'd like to thank Jay Stoller and Joan Greenfield for...

41:51.976 --> 42:16.785
making this happen I think that they've been terrific so I just want to acknowledge I'd also like to let each of you know that we have about 10 minutes left and during these 10 minutes they're going to be some some photographers just snapping some pictures so be completely at ease keep asking questions but that's what's going to be happening okay don't pay any attention to them yeah

42:17.356 --> 42:29.613
When you see, like, your book being made into a movie, do you ever feel that you could depict the essence of the movie better if you were acting in it in the scene or something like that?

42:29.633 --> 42:34.540
The reality of it is that it is another thing.

42:36.402 --> 42:41.870
You know, I get to have the book be exactly the way I want it.

42:42.050 --> 42:45.675
And really, to an amazing degree, no one... You know, I'm always...

42:46.516 --> 42:48.879
The last few books, the publishers always say, it's fine.

42:48.899 --> 42:50.101
And I'm saying, no, it's not.

42:50.121 --> 42:51.924
You know, I still have more to do.

42:52.965 --> 42:54.147
So I have complete freedom.

42:54.668 --> 42:57.151
It then goes to whoever the director is.

42:57.171 --> 43:03.080
It goes to Barry Robinson or it goes to Steven Spielberg.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.843
Thank you.

43:05.944 --> 43:12.012
And they do what they would do.

43:12.032 --> 43:12.393
Wow.

43:12.893 --> 43:13.975
And what they do...

43:14.360 --> 43:17.384
What they do is not what I would do.

43:17.404 --> 43:19.968
Because they're not me and I'm not them.

43:19.988 --> 43:25.977
The best I can hope for is that they will make a good movie as an example of their work.

43:28.581 --> 43:31.465
And that it will be a good movie in its own terms.

43:31.485 --> 43:35.170
It's not fair for me to want it to be exactly what I have.

43:35.453 --> 43:42.019
What do you do after you complete a novel?

43:42.039 --> 43:43.360
Do you celebrate or do you want to keep married?

43:44.401 --> 43:46.162
Well, usually I try and take a rest.

43:46.183 --> 43:52.949
But in this case, I get to come and do publicity.

43:52.969 --> 43:56.692
I generally try and run away to avoid the reviews.

43:56.712 --> 43:59.514
So I'm going to Japan next week.

44:02.377 --> 44:04.819
Do you still have the opportunity to do a band form?

44:05.407 --> 44:07.750
I have the, yeah, I have the opportunity.

44:07.790 --> 44:09.693
I don't have the skeleton anymore.

44:10.975 --> 44:14.780
I played about three years ago, and I was just a massive pain.

44:14.881 --> 44:18.566
And, you know, I don't know what happened.

44:18.606 --> 44:31.384
I used to be able to hit them a lot, and now it's just, they've moved the basket around.

44:31.404 --> 44:31.665
I don't know.

44:31.685 --> 44:33.287
While you're both trying to keep in college, why did you try to keep in college?

44:34.837 --> 44:37.301
Because I had never done a sequel.

44:39.284 --> 44:44.171
I'm really interested to do what I haven't done.

44:44.191 --> 44:47.476
I would be really interested to write a play.

44:47.496 --> 44:53.685
At one time, I was going to write a cookbook, which filled my publisher with horror.

44:54.086 --> 44:57.190
And they thought, the last thing we need is your cookbook.

44:57.210 --> 45:02.278
And I know that they're looking forward to my book of poetry.

45:02.495 --> 45:04.697
If I haven't done it, I'm really interested.

45:04.717 --> 45:16.069
And so doing a sequel is, I mean, it isn't interesting in the sense of not being a new topic, but it's interesting because you have so little freedom in what to do.

45:16.089 --> 45:17.871
So I was, I did it.

45:17.891 --> 45:18.732
What type of book do you read?

45:22.676 --> 45:25.699
I read almost always not a fiction.

45:25.720 --> 45:30.004
And it's generally on some topic area that I'm studying.

45:33.173 --> 45:40.304
I think absolutely not.

45:42.247 --> 45:58.894
No, at one time actually I was going to write a sequel to Congo.

45:59.279 --> 46:15.064
And that was a situation where the movie was never going to be made.

46:15.084 --> 46:24.098
But now that the movie's been made, I won't be able to do it.

46:24.118 --> 46:25.440
What do you learn about the show about Morris?

46:25.460 --> 46:25.741
Relationships.

46:25.761 --> 46:26.222
Sad dating experiences.

46:26.242 --> 46:27.143
Which is the story of my life at that time.

46:27.832 --> 46:36.084
You know, unrequited love, people wouldn't go out to do things that turned out badly.

46:37.626 --> 46:42.614
That's what I knew.

46:42.634 --> 46:52.168
You know, there are a few people who are in the movie business who are in my class in high school.

46:52.308 --> 46:54.531
Mike Phillips is the producer who produced the

46:55.945 --> 47:04.280
and some people in television.

47:04.921 --> 47:10.211
So I see them sometimes.

47:10.231 --> 47:13.036
But it's kind of a kind of blown apart in a lot of different directions.

47:14.278 --> 47:17.463
And it's going to be a long time now.

47:17.484 --> 47:19.126
I don't understand how it happened.

47:19.146 --> 47:20.569
It's 35 years since I was here.

47:22.270 --> 47:23.011
I know.

47:23.431 --> 47:26.655
I think you've asked more than twice the age of what you've done.

47:28.176 --> 47:31.800
When Thursday night rolls around, do you actually watch ER, or it's all misty?

47:33.582 --> 47:34.543
Sometimes I watch it.

47:35.504 --> 47:48.438
I used to watch it, particularly in the early part of the first year, because I was very concerned about how it would feel to tune that in at 10 o'clock at night.

47:49.599 --> 47:51.501
But sometimes it's really exhausting.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.542
It's 20 o'clock at night.

47:53.562 --> 47:54.804
I don't want to watch this.

47:55.606 --> 47:59.933
So I wanted to have that audience experience.

47:59.953 --> 48:03.159
But generally, no, because I've already seen that.

48:10.672 --> 48:11.413
What do you remember most about that?

48:18.278 --> 48:32.575
I thought it was fabulous here.

48:32.595 --> 48:43.627
You know, I mean, at the time that I was here, it was very competitive.

48:43.647 --> 48:44.168
I mean, everyone was here.

48:44.654 --> 48:51.103
That's true.

48:51.123 --> 49:00.696
I mean, people, you know, used to throw up weeks before the actual people started.

49:00.977 --> 49:07.967
And there was a lot of tension about going to college and getting through grades.

49:07.987 --> 49:11.792
So it was a no-nonsense part.

49:14.033 --> 49:17.379
Okay, well, there you are.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.124
Hey, listen, I'm not opposed to that.

49:20.164 --> 49:24.572
This is the world, you know.

49:24.973 --> 49:27.498
It's a competitive plan.

49:28.900 --> 49:33.088
And I would think that you guys are getting to do this stuff.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.270
I mean, I certainly did.

49:36.072 --> 49:39.979
I was, I think, the first person from the school to go to Harvard.

49:40.079 --> 49:45.830
So there's a lot of stuff about how well prepared I would be at Harvard.

49:45.850 --> 49:49.797
And I just took off like a racket.

49:49.817 --> 49:57.611
I was very well prepared at this school.

49:57.811 --> 49:58.973
I was extremely well prepared for Harvard.

49:58.993 --> 49:59.654
And there's not much else to say.

49:59.674 --> 50:00.055
It was great.

50:01.132 --> 50:15.746
And you said that your father was a journalist.

50:15.766 --> 50:24.434
Do you think that, um, that I think it's getting passed on during the holidays and who would have wanted to be earlier?

50:24.454 --> 50:24.875
I think that's right.

50:24.895 --> 50:26.697
Well, at least I saw somebody typing as a way that I would, so it didn't seem weird to me.

50:26.717 --> 50:27.758
What do you think about reading about children?

50:27.778 --> 50:28.118
Yeah, I'm hungry.

50:30.460 --> 50:36.730
She's my daughter's godmother, and she's, if you want to know more about her, she's discussed a little bit of travel.

50:36.750 --> 50:41.056
She's a very unusual lady.

50:41.076 --> 50:41.777
Are you guys getting tired?

50:41.877 --> 50:58.002
Mark Twain went there for terrible death, but he talked about it.

50:58.022 --> 50:58.122
Yeah.

50:59.249 --> 51:06.656
I think behavior has consequences and has, I think there's a whole cascade of consequences.

51:06.716 --> 51:20.048
There's consequences in terms of how we behave with each other, you know, sort of ethical behavior, you know, correct right, right conduct, you know.

51:20.569 --> 51:28.176
There's broader consequences for how we behave inside our family structures, inside our institutions like this, or inside our communities.

51:28.426 --> 51:36.476
And there's global consequences.

51:36.496 --> 51:56.622
I don't know how they became extinct, but I think that's how we'll become extinct if they're not there.

51:56.642 --> 51:57.083
You know,

52:04.167 --> 52:06.249
My third grade teacher was named Ms.

52:06.309 --> 52:08.592
Fromkin.

52:08.612 --> 52:17.982
And one day she gave me this, I think in the, the Frosden High School, I don't know if it's still there.

52:18.422 --> 52:23.628
And she gave me a canary to hold, and I let the canary go, and it flew up into this grave.

52:23.648 --> 52:28.273
And I was terribly embarrassed and upset.

52:29.134 --> 52:30.735
And I wanted to die.

52:31.276 --> 52:31.797
And Ms.

52:31.877 --> 52:33.178
Fromkin made that okay.

52:34.340 --> 52:39.090
and we somehow got the canary back.

52:39.791 --> 52:51.015
I don't know how to distinguish that important experience for me, for the contribution of my parents, the contribution of all of my other people here.
