WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:06.304
She said, what do you mean?

00:06.504 --> 00:14.177
I said, well, there aren't any letters in pizza anymore, especially like the one that you just mentioned.

00:14.197 --> 00:16.260
That letter is worth $50,000.

00:16.942 --> 00:19.085
She said, ooh, no Charlie.

00:19.105 --> 00:20.307
She calls me Charlie.

00:20.327 --> 00:24.194
She's the only living person who calls me Charlie.

00:24.214 --> 00:26.257
She said, do you think it's worth more?

00:26.397 --> 00:28.080
So finally,

00:28.482 --> 00:31.866
She sold it to him for $15,000.

00:31.886 --> 00:33.809
And I didn't know that he got it.

00:33.829 --> 00:40.337
When she said she'd sold it for $15,000, I said, Mary, who was the recipient?

00:40.497 --> 00:44.181
And she said, Bradley Martin.

00:44.201 --> 00:47.625
She said, do you think it's really worth more than that?

00:47.645 --> 00:49.167
Because she loves money.

00:49.187 --> 00:50.229
And you will find out.

00:50.249 --> 00:57.898
That can't be construed as a criticism because that's the first thing you're going to find out, that everything she equates with money.

00:58.182 --> 01:06.251
She doesn't equate John Keats with all the great poems that he wrote, which I love, and I'm sure she never read.

01:06.271 --> 01:09.055
The best poet I've ever lived, I think, in the English language.

01:09.075 --> 01:10.256
Yeah, fabulous.

01:10.356 --> 01:12.278
I loved it.

01:12.299 --> 01:15.202
There's a wonderful book that just came in from Harvard, by the way.

01:15.522 --> 01:17.805
It's The Facsimiles of the Manuscripts.

01:17.825 --> 01:24.713
I just got it, as I mentioned, I'm the book review editor, and it's the Houghton Collection of all the stuff at Harvard.

01:25.081 --> 01:31.149
But surely more than that, Amy Lowell had a big collection.

01:31.169 --> 01:31.349
Yeah.

01:31.489 --> 01:35.995
And Carl Forsheimer had a big collection.

01:36.015 --> 01:37.016
This is Keith's.

01:37.036 --> 01:40.200
There must be more than the Houghton collection.

01:40.220 --> 01:47.529
Well, I mean, at the Houghton Library.

01:47.549 --> 01:48.590
Yeah, okay.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.331
But the Houghton Library collection.

01:49.351 --> 01:49.531
Go ahead.

01:49.551 --> 01:50.092
I was going to say.

01:50.112 --> 01:52.074
Gary Benjamin.

01:52.095 --> 01:52.195
Yeah.

01:52.215 --> 01:53.036
And I think she was just sick about that.

01:53.056 --> 01:53.316
So anyway.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.949
keeps for $15,000.

01:55.969 --> 02:01.615
But I told her, I told her it was a terribly valuable letter.

02:01.915 --> 02:05.939
And Martin bragged about that market until the day of his death.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.321
It's probably the last words you ever spoke.

02:08.342 --> 02:11.805
Well, I saw that thing sold at the auction.

02:12.025 --> 02:12.406
I saw it.

02:12.426 --> 02:19.392
Tell me a little bit about Wise before.

02:19.412 --> 02:20.253
Thomas J. Wise and Carter and Pauline.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.016
John Carter was a very remarkable man.

02:23.671 --> 02:24.452
in many ways.

02:24.552 --> 02:32.443
His favorite poet, he did not have much of a sense of humor when he met me, but he was obliged to develop it.

02:32.463 --> 02:49.807
His favorite poet was A. E. Hausman, and the fact that I could quote from Hausman when we first met, I know a number of poets, impressed him greatly.

02:49.827 --> 02:52.851
And so we got along terrifically, and

02:53.506 --> 03:08.182
One time he said to me, you know, Haussmann is undoubtedly the greatest British poet of this century, and yet he has not truly appreciated the way he should be.

03:08.202 --> 03:14.669
And I said, don't underestimate the length and breadth of his fame, John.

03:14.689 --> 03:20.695
I got in an elevator the other day, and there engraved in bronze, I saw two words.

03:21.923 --> 03:27.673
from a two-word quote from when I was young and 20.

03:27.893 --> 03:29.696
And John said, really?

03:29.796 --> 03:30.718
In bronze?

03:30.738 --> 03:31.499
I said, yes.

03:31.519 --> 03:34.083
He said, oh, what were they?

03:34.103 --> 03:37.048
I said, otis.

03:37.288 --> 03:39.192
And otis, true, it is true.

03:39.212 --> 03:42.317
You know, otis in the elevator.

03:42.337 --> 03:42.998
That's funny.

03:43.058 --> 03:44.320
That's cute.

03:45.228 --> 03:47.932
That's a good story.

03:47.952 --> 03:50.836
He got a little upset, but he recovered quickly.

03:51.177 --> 03:51.718
That's a good story.

03:51.738 --> 04:00.411
And another time, John was a connoisseur of wines, and the temperature had to be exactly precise.

04:00.431 --> 04:10.986
I mean, if the temperature weren't 71.3, when it should be that, he would complain and send the wine back.

04:11.347 --> 04:13.530
And I always drank beer.

04:15.046 --> 04:27.161
And one day he said to me, why, why, why, God's name, were you drinking that awful swill when you could share this bottle of wine with me?

04:27.181 --> 04:42.921
And so I said, well, I said, since Hagee Hausman is your gospel, you surely should remember that milk does more than milk can to justify God's ways to man.

04:42.941 --> 04:43.382
And he said, oh, okay.

04:44.138 --> 04:48.603
Well, I won't make any more remarks about it.

04:48.643 --> 04:52.206
But he was a wonderful man, a great scholar, a great scholar.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.908
He was a first-class guy.

04:53.968 --> 04:58.873
And since he died, by the way, all of his files have gone down to Philadelphia to Rosenbach.

04:58.993 --> 05:04.098
And when Ed Wolff was doing his biography, he didn't have access to all that stuff.

05:04.118 --> 05:10.185
And so I might just go out and look at some of that stuff, and that'll be brand-new, fresh material, you know, on Rosenbach.

05:10.265 --> 05:13.588
And so they've told me I can have access to that, which is terrific.

05:14.648 --> 05:20.755
And even Ed Wolf has told me that that'll be stuff he didn't have a chance to look at, because it was all up in New York.

05:20.775 --> 05:24.218
I offered Ed Wolf some stories about Rosenbaum, but he didn't want them.

05:24.539 --> 05:25.099
Why is that?

05:25.660 --> 05:27.742
He said, I've already got more than I can use.

05:27.842 --> 05:32.447
Ed Wolf does not like me, as you will speedily discover.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.930
But I don't know why.

05:34.950 --> 05:35.210
He has.

05:35.250 --> 05:35.611
He has.

05:35.691 --> 05:39.095
He's said in his ways in some opinions, I think.

05:39.135 --> 05:43.980
But John Fleming liked me very much.

05:44.888 --> 05:49.316
What kind of Rosenbach stories did you have that you didn't want?

05:49.496 --> 05:51.339
Well, I'll tell you the story.

05:51.740 --> 06:05.243
I will clue you in, if I ever meet you, onto the purchase of Franklin's day book, which

06:06.472 --> 06:35.938
uh is described in considerable detail in books and bidders which was written by the way by emory strokash did you know that no so so the doctor didn't write that himself no he did not it was allegedly dictated but actually it was written by this uh secretary he had to whom he acknowledges his his debt of gratitude and she came in to see me one day a very old lady

06:36.627 --> 06:45.116
And most people never got in to see me because I don't see many people.

06:45.316 --> 06:50.721
But she got in to see me and I asked her to come in after I found out her name.

06:50.962 --> 07:00.071
And I said to her, you wrote books and bidders.

07:00.091 --> 07:01.052
And she said yes.

07:01.072 --> 07:06.297
And I jumped out of my chair and I went over and I threw my arms around her and kissed her.

07:07.323 --> 07:13.090
And I said, you know, that book was my Bible when I was a boy.

07:13.110 --> 07:13.390
Really?

07:13.410 --> 07:16.393
I have a signed copy of that, by the way.

07:16.413 --> 07:18.295
So what did she say to that?

07:18.416 --> 07:22.460
She said, oh, thank you so much.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.983
And I said, I'll prove it to you.

07:25.003 --> 07:30.029
I said, you start any sentence you want to and I'll finish it.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.330
Come on.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.011
And so she did.

07:32.031 --> 07:34.534
She started a sentence and I finished it.

07:34.554 --> 07:34.714
And

07:35.032 --> 07:36.475
She was absolutely floored.

07:36.616 --> 07:37.798
I'd be floored.

07:37.819 --> 07:38.841
How could you... Well, what?

07:39.122 --> 07:39.863
Talking to me?

07:39.883 --> 07:41.928
You think I'm feeble-minded, perhaps?

07:42.089 --> 07:47.120
No, but I read hundreds of books, but I don't think I could... I could recite them for a minute.

07:47.140 --> 07:48.163
Well, I was just lucky.

07:48.283 --> 07:49.626
I told her I was just lucky.

07:49.646 --> 07:52.433
I said I took a desperate gamble, and it worked.

07:52.713 --> 07:53.395
And, uh...

07:53.375 --> 07:55.598
Anyhow, I had a wonderful talk with him.

07:55.618 --> 07:56.098
That's great.

07:56.178 --> 07:59.962
Now, how about those, he did a little book of fiction of mystery stories.

07:59.982 --> 08:02.385
Do you think somebody ghosted them for him as well?

08:02.545 --> 08:04.568
I don't know about that.

08:04.588 --> 08:06.109
I have a copy of that.

08:06.270 --> 08:08.272
I just recently acquired it.

08:08.292 --> 08:14.279
Yeah, he brags about a copy bringing $40 when it was still available from the publisher at the publisher's price.

08:14.599 --> 08:15.380
I'm sure you know that.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.421
It's right in Books of Bitter.

08:16.441 --> 08:18.183
That's correct, yeah.

08:18.203 --> 08:19.605
That's right.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.766
It's a very interesting story.

08:21.421 --> 08:22.563
Okay.

08:22.583 --> 08:26.047
He told a lot of interesting stories, but a lot of them were poppycock.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.730
Well, he used to like to sit around.

08:27.750 --> 08:38.605
If you remind me about, I'll try to find the true story of how Rosenbach got Franklin's daybook.

08:38.685 --> 08:44.433
I mean, his expenses, telling what he printed and how much it cost and how many copies were printed.

08:44.453 --> 08:45.154
Really?

08:45.174 --> 08:45.775
And...

08:46.295 --> 08:49.440
I think he sold that for $17,500.

08:49.540 --> 08:59.394
And I've got in another book, a little pamphlet-like book that nobody knows about, the true story of how he bought it for $500.

08:59.414 --> 09:04.161
By ruining, screwing, and tattooing some poor soul.

09:05.343 --> 09:08.968
That goes back to what you were saying earlier, huh?

09:08.988 --> 09:09.649
Yep.

09:09.669 --> 09:15.357
Well, you know, Rosenbach himself said there never was a great book that wasn't stolen at least once.

09:16.231 --> 09:17.273
He said that?

09:17.413 --> 09:19.135
Yep.

09:19.175 --> 09:20.297
You're going to have to find that quote.

09:20.317 --> 09:21.539
Is that in Books and Bitters?

09:21.679 --> 09:22.240
I don't know.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.705
I have some other books by Rosenbaum.

09:25.725 --> 09:26.947
Yeah, Bookman's Holiday.

09:27.288 --> 09:30.933
That was John Fleming's favorite statement.

09:30.993 --> 09:31.854
That's a good story.

09:31.874 --> 09:42.871
And I said, John, you're only saying that because you've got a big collection of heisted books that the owners would be glad to reclaim if they knew you had them.

09:42.891 --> 09:43.572
That's a great story.

09:44.294 --> 09:46.936
I know a woman who used to work with him, Priscilla Juvelas.

09:46.956 --> 09:47.877
Did you know Priscilla?

09:48.318 --> 09:49.839
I don't know whether I did or not.

09:49.859 --> 09:51.441
Yeah, well, she's up here in Boston now.

09:51.461 --> 09:55.304
She's a book dealer.

09:55.324 --> 09:55.525
Very good.

09:55.545 --> 09:56.345
Very bright woman.

09:56.365 --> 09:58.968
She speaks very highly of Fleming.

09:58.988 --> 10:02.591
I was very, very fond of him.

10:02.611 --> 10:05.334
And I know that he liked me a lot.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.317
Do you know this fellow Dave Kirchenbaum in New York at all?

10:08.717 --> 10:09.918
The Carnegie books?

10:09.938 --> 10:10.619
Yeah, I know him.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.040
What do you know about him?

10:12.644 --> 10:20.256
except that he's 95 years old, and he wrote the introduction to the Bradley Martin catalog there.

10:20.276 --> 10:21.598
You know, I like Dave.

10:21.618 --> 10:24.202
A lot of people run him down.

10:24.322 --> 10:28.308
He came to see me about five years ago.

10:28.408 --> 10:40.446
I'd ordered something from him, or I'd ordered something from somebody else, and he happened to be in this guy's shop, and the guy said, would you take this over to Hamilton since you're going over his way?

10:40.466 --> 10:41.588
So he brought it in to me.

10:42.614 --> 10:48.923
And I took it, and I thanked him, and I said, just a minute, Dave, I'll give you a dollar.

10:48.943 --> 10:59.038
I said, look, I didn't realize, you know, that you were doing this kind of thing, but I occasionally have use for a messenger, and I'd be very happy to.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.041
He said, oh, no.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.024
He said, I'm not a messenger.

11:03.044 --> 11:04.727
Of course I knew that.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.948
I'm just kidding.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.170
Nice guy.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.352
I had lunch with him one day.

11:09.277 --> 11:25.139
You know, a real interesting guy that you should talk to is, uh, uh, give me a second, uh, Argosy, uh, Lou, uh, Lou Cohen.

11:25.159 --> 11:26.821
Okay, the Argosy bookstore guy, right?

11:27.021 --> 11:31.167
Yeah, and he has a daughter named, uh, uh,

11:34.471 --> 11:35.573
It's okay.

11:35.993 --> 11:38.096
The Agassi bookstore, that's all I need tonight.

11:38.116 --> 11:39.939
Yeah, go and see Lou Cohen.

11:39.959 --> 11:40.420
Okay.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.406
Without fail, he is a gold mine of anecdotes.

11:44.446 --> 11:45.467
That's what I need.

11:45.487 --> 11:50.014
And those gals, Westenburg and Stern, some people say, are pretty interesting, too.

11:50.034 --> 11:51.576
Ralph?

11:51.777 --> 11:52.478
I don't know him.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.442
I haven't talked to him yet, but a few people have said I might talk to them, too.

11:55.723 --> 11:58.707
You know, I'm interested in people that go back a little way and...

11:59.210 --> 12:00.392
Yeah, that's what I figured.

12:00.412 --> 12:03.656
That's the reason you got in touch with me.

12:03.676 --> 12:06.259
Well, yeah, but what I like is you're not a bullshitter either.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.163
I mean, you come straight at you.

12:09.183 --> 12:10.185
I love that.

12:10.245 --> 12:15.552
I mean, you say what's on your mind.

12:15.953 --> 12:20.699
But Lou Feldman, I mean, Lou Cohen will give you a lot of really good stories.

12:20.719 --> 12:22.982
Do you think he knew Lou Feldman?

12:23.002 --> 12:24.204
Oh, sure.

12:24.484 --> 12:24.644
Yeah.

12:24.664 --> 12:28.009
I'm really trying to get a profile of this guy together.

12:28.029 --> 12:28.289
Feldman?

12:28.730 --> 12:28.930
Yeah.

12:29.112 --> 12:33.818
Not a profile, but I really want to know how he could have become the exclusive agent for Texas.

12:34.479 --> 12:39.306
That's really a story that hasn't been answered yet.

12:39.406 --> 12:44.433
I've heard about dealers who went to Texas and offered stuff, and they couldn't sell it.

12:44.453 --> 12:48.659
They sell it to Lou Feldman, and then they'd buy it for, you know, this is what people say.

12:48.679 --> 12:52.484
Oh, boy, I can tell you a lot of stories about that.

12:52.504 --> 12:55.508
I can tell you a lot of gruesome stories about jail.

12:56.163 --> 12:57.445
Yale is the same thing.

12:57.525 --> 13:02.332
They say Yale almost went there, you know, but that's the Beinecke, and that's good stature.

13:02.372 --> 13:03.914
That's Ivy League, right?

13:03.934 --> 13:05.216
You can get away with it over there.

13:05.817 --> 13:08.420
Well, I'll tell you.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.124
If I'm in the mood, I might tell you a few stories.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.748
I have a feeling we have to get together in New York sometime.

13:14.549 --> 13:16.872
Are you agreeable to that?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.041
I don't know.

13:18.061 --> 13:21.164
It depends on how much work I have.

13:21.185 --> 13:25.309
It just happens that I am so exhausted now that I didn't want to work.

13:26.230 --> 13:31.777
And so I told my assistant that I didn't want to talk to you.

13:31.837 --> 13:33.118
I said, change and put him off.

13:33.138 --> 13:34.119
I don't want to see him at all.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.465
And she said, well, you know, I put him off already and you made this appointment.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.589
So I said, all right, I'll talk to him for a minute.

13:42.788 --> 13:43.609
Okay.

13:44.230 --> 13:48.635
Then I realized that if I quit talking to you, I have other hideous jobs.

13:48.655 --> 13:49.976
So I'm the lucky guy then.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.779
I'm the lucky recipient of all this.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.501
Okay.

13:54.621 --> 14:00.728
Well, sometimes, you know, you can win bigger by default than if you really knock your opponent out.

14:00.768 --> 14:03.531
And he fails to show up for the fight.

14:03.691 --> 14:05.553
Well, about the T.J.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.075
Weiss situation, though.

14:07.155 --> 14:08.797
Did you say you knew much about that?

14:09.157 --> 14:09.398
Yes.

14:09.778 --> 14:12.181
I know a few things about that.

14:12.201 --> 14:12.441
And...

14:13.214 --> 14:18.879
I guess there had been suspicions that he had done some forgeries before.

14:18.919 --> 14:36.376
As far back as 1902 and 1903, the writing edition of the sonnets of Elizabeth Barrow Browning, that had been condemned.

14:36.396 --> 14:41.601
And what Wise did, of course, was since he was a member of the Browning Society,

14:42.290 --> 14:52.285
He had the unbelievable chutzpah to take the forgery of that damn book to Robert Browning.

14:52.426 --> 15:03.503
And Browning looked at it, and he wrote on it, this must be a pirated edition, as I never heard of it before.

15:03.683 --> 15:05.446
Or words to that effect.

15:05.466 --> 15:09.512
Now, in essence, that...

15:10.066 --> 15:15.573
established this book which bought high prices at one time.

15:15.593 --> 15:17.735
Do you think there's a crow on our line?

15:17.755 --> 15:19.197
No, I don't.

15:19.217 --> 15:23.102
I hear you flying.

15:23.122 --> 15:30.691
Uh, instead of a forgery, you understand there's a great difference between a pirated book and a forged book.

15:30.711 --> 15:37.980
A pirated book can be a very valuable book published prior to the, uh,

15:38.652 --> 15:41.898
the authorized first edition.

15:42.179 --> 15:46.687
Whereas a forgery is nothing but a damn forgery, no matter how you look at it.

15:46.707 --> 15:47.188
That's right.

15:47.228 --> 15:52.377
Well, I mean, D. H. Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's Lover, had some very interesting forgery, piracies.

15:52.397 --> 15:53.139
Yes.

15:53.159 --> 15:55.463
Those are not much collected.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.575
Well, because I guess there were so many of them.

15:57.595 --> 15:59.778
There were so many of them, yeah.

15:59.798 --> 15:59.938
Yeah.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.420
I mean, Kipling had some forgeries.

16:01.580 --> 16:11.234
In those days, all you had to do was use a four-letter word beginning with F and ending with K. And I don't mean fork, which is something I've used with a knife.

16:11.254 --> 16:15.720
And your book would be pirated.

16:15.740 --> 16:21.788
Can you imagine how many editions there have been of things like The Story of a Flea or Fanny Hill or that kind of thing?

16:22.105 --> 16:24.030
Innumerable.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.254
Innumerable.

16:25.294 --> 16:28.603
But you think that they stayed away from Wise because of his stature.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.635
He was a major, major guy in England, and he was a heavyweight.

16:32.655 --> 16:36.385
They had given the Ashley Library to the British Museum.

16:36.922 --> 16:44.841
Not only that, as a reward for his forgeries, Oxford made him an honorary Master of Arts.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.086
And there is a picture of him.

16:47.106 --> 16:47.948
Oh, it's wonderful.

16:47.968 --> 16:53.040
Yeah, it's the farthest piece, the Paddington's biography, which is just wonderful, with his cap and gown on.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.525
Which bio are you alluding to?

16:56.545 --> 16:57.366
Of Forging Ahead.

16:57.727 --> 16:58.889
Oh, that's Partington's book.

16:58.909 --> 17:01.072
That's what I just said, Partington's book.

17:01.452 --> 17:01.673
Yeah.

17:01.753 --> 17:08.963
The letter book is Ratchford's Letters of T.J.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.666
Wise and John H. Wren.

17:10.686 --> 17:11.687
Yeah, I've got that.

17:11.707 --> 17:12.408
That's excellent.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.912
But that's really kind of a little one-sided, though.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.054
You really don't get the other side.

17:16.294 --> 17:17.135
I don't know.

17:17.376 --> 17:22.403
You get the other side if you know what this bastard was up to.

17:22.383 --> 17:31.132
Then you get it, and you get it, and you see the subtleties of the whole thing.

17:31.172 --> 17:33.494
The manipulations that are going on, I think, too.

17:33.614 --> 17:42.463
Yeah, because otherwise you just hear the naked facts of what he did without understanding how he was able to do it.

17:42.483 --> 17:50.010
It was brilliant, because he also had access to the British Library, and so he managed to get copies in the library collections, which gave them provenance.

17:50.412 --> 17:53.556
Yes, he stole title pages.

17:53.616 --> 17:54.717
Isn't that unbelievable?

17:54.737 --> 17:55.839
You talk about brazen.

17:56.099 --> 18:00.765
I mean, they proved that he tore out pages so he could make complete copies.

18:01.526 --> 18:02.167
Unbelievable.

18:02.827 --> 18:04.029
I'm going to let you go now, sir.

18:04.429 --> 18:06.392
Okay.

18:06.412 --> 18:07.173
What's your name?

18:07.213 --> 18:08.134
My name is Nick.

18:08.234 --> 18:09.015
Is it Nicholas?

18:09.316 --> 18:10.517
Just a minute, I'll write it down.

18:10.537 --> 18:10.797
Okay.

18:14.662 --> 18:14.822
Yeah.

18:14.963 --> 18:15.323
Nick.

18:15.556 --> 18:16.397
As in Nicholas.

18:16.557 --> 18:17.258
Okay.

18:17.338 --> 18:19.941
It's B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

18:20.121 --> 18:21.042
Baz Baines.

18:23.004 --> 18:23.825
B-A-S-A-N-E-S.

18:23.845 --> 18:26.648
B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

18:28.089 --> 18:31.493
Greek name.

18:31.513 --> 18:31.793
Baz Baines.

18:31.813 --> 18:33.755
I'm going to just send you a letter.

18:34.116 --> 18:35.537
Thank you for this conversation.

18:35.597 --> 18:38.300
And say no way in.

18:38.921 --> 18:39.361
A little better.

18:40.002 --> 18:40.502
Okay.

18:40.763 --> 18:41.243
Okay?

18:41.560 --> 18:48.809
And you certainly can quote anything I've said, except please don't quote anything.

18:48.829 --> 18:52.554
If I happen to say anything against a living person, I don't want to do that.

18:52.574 --> 18:54.517
No, you were very circumspect about that.

18:54.617 --> 18:59.183
And it's not because I fear it, because I don't fear anybody or anything.

18:59.203 --> 19:03.809
It's just that I don't want to hurt anybody or, you know.

19:03.829 --> 19:04.750
Yep, no need for it.

19:05.725 --> 19:07.069
There are enough dead people.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.457
Okay.

19:09.477 --> 19:09.838
Okay.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.005
Thank you, sir.

19:12.266 --> 19:13.209
Thank you very much.

19:13.229 --> 19:15.135
Lots of luck on your other interviews.

19:15.275 --> 19:16.620
Thank you, sir.

19:19.068 --> 19:19.228
Bye-bye.
