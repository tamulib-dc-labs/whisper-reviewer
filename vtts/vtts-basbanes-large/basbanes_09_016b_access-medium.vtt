00:03.203 --> 00:05.426
Charlie, okay.

00:05.446 --> 00:07.449
You have a good one then.

00:08.190 --> 00:18.623
What happens, you see, is in the world according to Garp, I just began the story at the beginning.

00:19.805 --> 00:32.181
And I've regretted that many times since because it seems to me many people were misled in that the story begins with Garp's mother and how she gets herself pregnant and how she has Garp.

00:32.752 --> 00:38.760
And for easily the first 100 pages of that book, Jenny Fields is the main character.

00:39.661 --> 00:43.226
And then she yields to her son.

00:44.427 --> 00:54.460
And there's a kind of an emotional, psychological false start that the reader has to make, a kind of choice between characters.

00:57.664 --> 01:02.691
Similarly, I could have made the same decision

01:03.785 --> 01:05.067
with the Cider House Rules.

01:05.848 --> 01:17.526
That is, I could have begun with Dr. Larch's childhood, which is the beginning of the story.

01:18.147 --> 01:28.903
But I felt certain that Dr. Larch was really, although he was the main sort of spiritual force of the book, the main character was Homer Wells, the orphan.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.767
And so I began with Homer Wells being born.

01:32.472 --> 01:42.162
in his early years at the orphanage and the early attempts to adopt him before I flashed back to Larch's childhood.

01:43.603 --> 01:53.633
And by the time I got to Owen Meany, I was really comfortable with going back and forth in time.

01:53.713 --> 02:00.960
In other words, in order to go back and forth in time, in order to flash forward, to flash back,

02:01.312 --> 02:08.782
You have to have a very clear idea of the actual chronology of the story in order to take liberties about where to begin it.

02:09.784 --> 02:12.587
My choice in Son of the Circus was obvious.

02:12.647 --> 02:14.931
To me, there were three places I could have begun.

02:15.852 --> 02:21.700
I could have begun with Martin Mills arriving, which would have been chaos and confusion.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.584
The reader would have been as confused as Martin.

02:25.465 --> 02:27.808
It would have been funny, but funny in a very different way.

02:28.463 --> 02:49.537
And that would have presented me with an enormous flashback, because to begin with Martin Mill's arrival would necessitate not only telling the story of how he got to be a twin after we've met him, so to speak, which I didn't think was as funny as knowing he's a twin when we see him arrive, right?

02:50.979 --> 02:51.961
So that was a choice.

02:53.844 --> 02:55.787
And the easy place to begin the story,

02:56.763 --> 03:05.595
and not have to worry about flashbacks and flash-forwards and sort of juggling time, would have been to begin with Nancy and go, begin with Nancy.

03:06.456 --> 03:17.831
But that would have been an imitation of what I think was Garp's problem as a novel, which is, if you begin with Nancy, you meet Dr. Darawalla as a minor character.

03:18.352 --> 03:19.534
He comes into her life.

03:20.435 --> 03:26.483
And you then have to make a shift, some hundred pages later, to realizing that he's the main character.

03:26.767 --> 03:27.408
You see what I mean?

03:27.889 --> 03:33.417
And so I felt that the best place to begin was where it would end.

03:35.481 --> 03:44.255
He realizes at the end that he will always go back to India, that he will keep returning there, and he's no longer kidding himself that he's doing it for the dwarfs.

03:44.956 --> 03:50.825
He's no longer kidding himself that, because his dwarf blood project is dead, he didn't get there.

03:51.526 --> 03:54.090
And now he knows he's going back, and he can't.

03:54.644 --> 04:01.991
sort of metaphorically or comically or with any credibility anymore, say, it's the dwarfs.

04:02.151 --> 04:06.455
Well, it's interesting he keeps the apartment with his servants.

04:07.036 --> 04:09.478
I mean, that's... Yes, yes.

04:09.558 --> 04:10.379
That's a tip-off.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.141
That's a tip-off.

04:15.564 --> 04:21.630
You know, it's a nice... To me, that gave the book...

04:22.167 --> 04:23.228
a kind of bookend.

04:24.550 --> 04:31.378
To have the first section called Blood from Dwarfs and the last section called Not the Dwarfs gave it a kind of symmetry.

04:33.520 --> 04:51.702
But as important to me as that was the real point in time where the piece begins is the Doctor, it's in the first chapter that we discovered the body of Mr. Lal, and Mr. Lal is the penultimate

04:52.340 --> 04:53.502
murder in the novel.

04:54.103 --> 05:16.542
And I like that idea of encountering a victim that looks like a victim of something else, and then of someone else, but not at all like the 68th or 69th victim in a sort of sea of serial killings.

05:17.062 --> 05:20.606
Did the vultures really move in that way in India?

05:20.686 --> 05:21.547
Oh, yeah.

05:21.567 --> 05:22.328
Oh, yeah.

05:22.348 --> 05:24.110
Geez.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.372
I mean, they don't waste any time.

05:26.472 --> 05:28.435
No, they don't waste any time.

05:28.455 --> 05:34.501
I mean, were you consciously playing in an opening scene a Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson kind of a takeoff?

05:34.601 --> 05:35.662
It is kind of funny.

05:35.682 --> 05:36.463
It's supposed to be.

05:36.503 --> 05:41.609
Well, you see, when you say, you see, that's, it's all kind of funny to me.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.091
I mean, to me, it's very funny.

05:43.111 --> 05:44.352
You're a real doctor here.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.938
And the cop is a fake cop.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.881
He's very good at it.

05:48.901 --> 05:48.981
Yes.

05:49.001 --> 05:49.321
Yes.

05:50.042 --> 05:53.046
And he's making deductions of the regular investigators.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.609
He's very good.

05:55.149 --> 05:55.530
Yes.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.112
And I said, this is funny.

05:57.132 --> 06:03.200
I mean, I wonder if he's actually, you know, giving us a sense here of maybe this is just something I'm picking up.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.622
But I enjoyed that.

06:04.662 --> 06:04.802
No, no.

06:04.822 --> 06:09.729
It's, I think, well, I think, I hope the whole novel is funny.

06:09.789 --> 06:14.035
But obviously, you know, the...

06:14.842 --> 06:17.686
The idiot at Publishers Weekly wasn't laughing.

06:17.846 --> 06:17.967
No.

06:19.048 --> 06:20.811
Do you see yourself as a satirist at all?

06:23.275 --> 06:25.939
I mean, there is exaggeration of this humor.

06:25.959 --> 06:29.063
I don't know what the qualities are that makes sense.

06:29.083 --> 06:37.596
I think in some cases, certainly you could say that the whole section about the movie guys in Bombay is a satire.

06:37.616 --> 06:40.360
The whole chapter called The Vermin, the flashback about

06:40.711 --> 06:43.054
Gordon and Vera and the whole crew.

06:43.074 --> 06:49.544
But every time you've got a good thing about those things, you just give me one of those little titles, and I know instantly where we are.

06:49.704 --> 06:51.326
Well, that's why I kept them there.

06:51.366 --> 06:57.395
I mean, they were always a part of the manuscript, but they weren't always.

06:58.256 --> 06:59.017
I interrupted.

06:59.077 --> 07:01.360
You were going off of a sad time, so let's go back to that.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.081
No, no, no.

07:02.101 --> 07:08.811
I just mean that that's the portrait of the movie people.

07:09.365 --> 07:11.127
is a satire.

07:11.167 --> 07:19.578
The portrait of Martin Mills' childhood in California is a kind of a bookend to the early bookend.

07:19.598 --> 07:26.166
In other words, we get an early view of how these people conduct their lives, Vera and Danny and Gordon Hathaway and the rest of them.

07:26.186 --> 07:38.781
We get a view of how they conduct their lives in Bombay, and then very near the end of the novel, we see what a horrible childhood Martin Mills has had, which is also a part of the movie business.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.405
Do you remember Gordon Hathaway and the old Steve Allen show?

07:41.505 --> 07:43.449
Has that really came up with the name for that character?

07:43.469 --> 07:43.689
No.

07:44.150 --> 07:47.336
Remember the Louie Nye's, I'm Gordon Hathaway, I'm from Manhattan?

07:47.356 --> 07:47.597
No.

07:47.617 --> 07:49.781
Remember Steve Allen used to do the man on the street?

07:49.801 --> 07:50.502
I remember that.

07:50.522 --> 07:58.558
Old, old 1950s, and the guy would come on, and he had Louie Nye, Don Hodge, and Louie Nye was, I'm Gordon Hathaway, and I'm from Manhattan.

07:58.977 --> 08:04.445
No, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't remember that.

08:04.465 --> 08:06.668
I don't remember that.

08:08.511 --> 08:10.554
No, I don't remember that.

08:13.418 --> 08:19.226
I was a big Steve Allen fan, too.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.355
We group here.

08:26.857 --> 08:27.398
You do?

08:28.424 --> 08:56.305
I think that the weight of...

08:57.837 --> 09:26.235
a defect, a mutation, an illness, an element that makes someone appear freakish to the outside world is often, if you present them properly, can often be a means of making them a most sympathetic character.

09:26.976 --> 09:27.777
For example,

09:29.140 --> 09:39.410
Dr. Larch is an ether addict, but his service to those orphans and to that orphanage at St.

09:39.510 --> 09:57.848
Cloud's is full of such obvious love and care that his addiction grows

10:00.933 --> 10:12.364
to become, rather than a criticism of him or a failure of him, an indication of how vulnerable he is.

10:14.626 --> 10:28.780
Vinod's dwarfism, the hand controls in his car, the way he's shot by the elephant into the bleacher seats, is

10:30.329 --> 10:44.585
His coping with that deformity, with that defect, is a large part of his heroism.

10:48.730 --> 10:57.940
I'm setting up the moment when he comes to Martin Mills' rescue.

10:58.578 --> 11:04.285
you know, whacking the transvestites away with his squash racket handles.

11:05.347 --> 11:09.872
That image of him, you know, it needs a little background.

11:09.972 --> 11:22.488
You need to know the crippled, sort of damaged, sort of injured life that has preceded it.

11:23.069 --> 11:25.412
And...

11:26.540 --> 11:42.158
Even a character who is pure evil, who is just the most menacing of villains, a character like Raoul or Mrs. Dogger, is himself or herself.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.665
You know, someone who is severely afflicted.

11:52.130 --> 11:56.395
They just are characters who, you know, who's...

11:57.387 --> 12:05.855
difference is another road to creating sympathy.

12:08.378 --> 12:17.006
Is exaggeration still as much part of your bag of tools as it was earlier novels?

12:17.026 --> 12:18.147
I don't think so.

12:18.167 --> 12:26.635
And yet, I think that some people reading this book, especially those people that we've mentioned who are not reading it,

12:27.863 --> 12:44.069
as friends or as John Irving readers, will seize upon some of the freaks in it and sort of declare it to be another kind of freak show repetition.

12:44.129 --> 12:52.302
The misunderstanding, of course, is that these people are largely seen through Dr. Darawalla's eyes.

12:52.737 --> 13:01.931
And Dr. Dharawala himself is the least freakish, the most ordinary, in a good sense, the most normal of people that I've ever written about.

13:03.052 --> 13:06.658
He's, you know, he is a... You know how he sees quotes?

13:07.058 --> 13:07.259
Yes.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.526
He is the most, he is absolutely the most normal.

13:13.368 --> 13:19.477
And he looks upon these people not as freaks, but with affection.

13:20.178 --> 13:20.398
And

13:21.340 --> 13:50.807
I think to seize upon the freakishness of these characters or any characters of mine is also a... It's a misunderstanding of the pains that have been taken in a book like this to make every word of the atmosphere, the background of the story, authentic.

13:51.209 --> 14:00.068
There is not an act attributed to the circus that I made up.

14:01.291 --> 14:08.547
Whether it's the farting clown or the cricket playing elephants, they are all acts I have seen.

14:09.249 --> 14:09.910
They exist.

14:10.531 --> 14:15.776
There is nothing made up about the transsexual community.

14:15.876 --> 14:18.338
It does exist.

14:21.201 --> 14:28.528
They absolutely do.

14:28.848 --> 14:39.778
And one of the things that I'm so pleased with as a coincidence is that, I don't know if you see much in the way of science news,

14:40.535 --> 14:57.880
But the very defect that causes achondroplasia, the kind of dwarfism that Dr. Darawalla has been searching for, a genetic marker for, that very defect has been found just now.

15:03.648 --> 15:08.635
The timing is wonderful for me because

15:09.357 --> 15:19.549
It gives a kind of nobility to Dr. Dorawala having searched for this for so long, and in his amateur effort, he gives up.

15:20.731 --> 15:21.872
You're looking for a tough stone.

15:21.892 --> 15:23.554
I mean, first of all, I'm reading this.

15:23.574 --> 15:27.439
I don't know if you watch the news, but did you see that rogue elephant killed that?

15:27.459 --> 15:28.060
Oh, yeah.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.141
Unbelievable, right?

15:29.161 --> 15:29.261
Yeah.

15:29.281 --> 15:30.422
And then meanwhile, the O.J.

15:30.463 --> 15:37.491
Simpson thing is going on, all this DNA, and people are learning all about genetic markers.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.674
And I hope they won.

15:40.694 --> 15:41.815
I hope they won.

15:41.935 --> 15:43.057
Yeah, I don't know what they really won.

15:43.077 --> 15:46.742
In any case, it's not all that bizarre, is it?

15:47.623 --> 15:52.089
I mean, all of these different things.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.812
They're that elephant thing.

15:54.832 --> 15:55.513
It's an elephant stalking.

15:55.533 --> 15:56.374
It's unbelievable.

15:56.394 --> 15:59.198
I know you've got some three.

15:59.218 --> 16:02.382
I don't want to say about Logan.

16:04.370 --> 16:08.575
And I don't mean to dwell on Garth either, but I do want to ask one question.

16:08.595 --> 16:19.908
Did the overwhelming success of Garth, maybe two questions, in a sense, liberate you to do the kind of novel?

16:19.928 --> 16:22.030
Yeah, I'm happy to be asked the question that way.

16:22.070 --> 16:29.158
You see, you just presume that the success makes the next one harder or something.

16:29.178 --> 16:33.583
This is a poor understanding of the time it takes to write anything.

16:35.116 --> 17:00.147
The truth is that I don't think... I don't think I could have written a novel as ambitious as this one or as The Cider House Rules if I were living the same way I had always the right up to and including the writing of The World According to God, namely with teaching jobs and coaching jobs and other jobs.

17:00.708 --> 17:02.710
I think...

17:03.736 --> 17:19.451
at least in the five and a half years that this book took me, I think it's a 10 or a 12 year project if I have another job.

17:19.751 --> 17:25.196
And it's probably for that reason, therefore, a book I would not ever have begun.

17:26.117 --> 17:31.262
There are things you can do, things you can dream of doing as a writer

17:32.086 --> 17:38.215
when the day is yours and when your job is being a writer.

17:39.157 --> 17:54.219
And for the first four books, Garp included, I was a teacher, I was a coach who had to find time, usually not more than two hours a day, to write.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.205
Ask a doctor to practice medicine for two hours a day.

17:58.446 --> 18:00.709
Ask a lawyer to practice law for two hours a day.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.354
What are they going to get?

18:03.055 --> 18:04.017
How far can they go?

18:05.539 --> 18:27.895
I feel so grateful for the freedom I have to be a full-time writer that I think, consciously or unconsciously, I feel I have to pay back that

18:29.444 --> 18:40.123
that gift, and the way to pay it back is to give more of myself to a bigger book, a bigger and a bigger book.

18:45.632 --> 18:48.838
Have you got the next novel in mind?

18:48.858 --> 18:51.823
Have you had that epiphanous moment where you've seen something?

18:52.698 --> 18:58.108
Well, I have a story in mind, but I'm not ready to start it.

18:58.689 --> 19:02.535
I'm not ready to start it.

19:02.555 --> 19:06.122
One thing Tim said, which is really interesting.

19:06.142 --> 19:08.326
He's one of the greatest things to O'Brien.

19:08.406 --> 19:13.575
He said, prior to that, John was perceived as

19:15.631 --> 19:18.876
a literary writer.

19:18.896 --> 19:31.333
He said one of the unfortunate spin-offs in Garth is that he began to be perceived as a commercial writer.

19:31.353 --> 19:35.159
People neglected to see many of the wonderful literary things that were in Garth.

19:35.179 --> 19:37.582
I don't know if that's a question, but that's a comment.

19:37.602 --> 19:41.287
Do you generally agree with that kind of an assessment?

19:41.307 --> 19:45.233
Do you think that there are literary things that people tend to miss?

19:45.820 --> 19:54.110
Well, I don't think there are literary things that people may have missed, so much as this.

19:54.230 --> 20:07.146
I mean, I think it is simply true that there are people who are very set in their mind that literary means barely known or not well known at all.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.527
That's what literary means.

20:09.348 --> 20:14.815
If you're a literary writer, it means... It means...

20:15.385 --> 20:18.109
You're not on the New York Times bestseller list.

20:18.129 --> 20:23.818
The books on the bestseller list are slick, trash, commercial fiction.

20:24.800 --> 20:29.968
Unfortunately, that is the case.

20:29.988 --> 20:37.360
That may be the case the majority of the time, but I don't think that...

20:40.192 --> 20:41.374
You know, I'm not unique.

20:41.434 --> 20:45.059
I'm not the only literary author who has bestsellers.

20:45.179 --> 20:50.025
I love Dr. George's new books.

20:50.045 --> 20:53.490
Yes, yeah.

20:53.510 --> 20:58.497
It's amazing to see, and all of a sudden you see, wow, good books on there, you know?

20:58.517 --> 20:58.837
Yeah.

20:59.478 --> 21:01.300
This guy Walter Mosley, have you read him?

21:01.701 --> 21:03.343
Yeah, I think he's very funny.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.406
I think he's got a heck of a future.

21:05.825 --> 21:07.407
Who do you read, by the way?

21:07.427 --> 21:10.912
Do you read contemporary writers?

21:10.932 --> 21:24.270
I certainly read a lot of 19th century writers, but among my contemporaries, I tend to like those big 19th century-like storytellers.

21:24.290 --> 21:28.576
Garcia Marquez, Robertson Davies, Guido Gras.

21:30.979 --> 21:34.684
They are sizably important to me.

21:35.440 --> 21:54.617
I have one or two other questions on how it took all the time.

21:54.638 --> 21:56.099
Does it ever concern you that you might bend a few people out of shape?

21:56.119 --> 21:57.700
I'm going back to Garth now.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.001
I'm convinced.

21:58.021 --> 21:58.361
I was in the U.S.

21:58.381 --> 21:59.602
when I saw the National Book Award that year.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.744
I'm not asking you to comment on this, but I mean you had Mary Lee, Settle, and Alice and Lori.

22:01.764 --> 22:02.865
I know instantly when I saw those two out of three,

22:03.453 --> 22:09.442
that they were going to respond to the Ellen James and that type thing.

22:09.462 --> 22:20.499
And I'm convinced that there was this backlash of people reading things out just the same way somebody might take the CFM out of here and become angry.

22:20.519 --> 22:26.608
And I'm wondering, I'd love to know who the person was that wrote FPW preview, for instance.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.383
what baggage that reader brought to that book.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.245
You're right that there's baggage there.

22:31.425 --> 22:32.586
You're absolutely right.

22:32.766 --> 22:43.759
That's the key to understanding those kind of reviews is that you know that there was a predisposition to that review that had nothing to do with this book.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.440
I don't think so, because it's not the book I read.

22:45.861 --> 22:46.461
No.

22:46.542 --> 22:49.425
And regrettably, I read the thing before I read the book.

22:49.445 --> 22:49.785
Yeah, I know.

22:50.446 --> 22:53.729
And I said, I told my wife, I said, this book is great.

22:53.930 --> 22:56.933
You know, I said, look at the P.W., thank you.

22:57.284 --> 23:00.790
That's really too bad, because that can't... Who reads P.W.

23:00.810 --> 23:02.112
outside of librarians?

23:02.132 --> 23:09.203
In any case, the newspaper people... Yeah, and what librarian is not going to be stuck in a bunch of my books?

23:09.223 --> 23:10.725
They have to.

23:10.765 --> 23:15.633
Well, you see, I think that is a factor to the anger in that review.

23:17.076 --> 23:24.928
Don't forget that it is the case for many writers that the good review

23:26.056 --> 23:32.385
is not only desirable, but necessary, that without the good review, the reader doesn't find you.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.708
The reader doesn't know who you are.

23:35.429 --> 23:36.771
The reader will not find you.

23:37.232 --> 23:42.639
That is the case with so many writers who just aren't well enough known.

23:43.200 --> 23:51.832
They desperately need the good review, well-placed, well-timed, in order to get to the reader.

23:52.573 --> 23:54.316
Now, I don't anymore.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.077
See what I mean?

23:55.417 --> 23:55.978
In other words,

23:56.397 --> 24:10.993
This book, you know, is number nine on the publisher's weekly best-selling list.

24:11.013 --> 24:15.979
It will start next week at number ten on the New York Times list.

24:16.559 --> 24:21.865
It is already number four on the Boston Globe list, number four on the Toronto

24:22.435 --> 24:25.459
Globe and Mail list, number four in the Los Angeles Times.

24:26.340 --> 24:26.460
Wow.

24:26.881 --> 24:29.925
And it's not even published until the second week of September.

24:30.665 --> 24:31.186
See what I mean?

24:31.687 --> 24:36.393
So there are no reviews, and it's there, right?

24:36.994 --> 24:52.273
And the person who read my last novel or any novel of mine and loved it is going to keep going back until I've written a couple in a row

24:52.642 --> 24:54.104
that they really hate.

24:54.985 --> 24:56.026
And that hasn't happened yet.

24:56.888 --> 25:05.759
And you must understand that this, I think, is very crippling to those reviewers who don't like me.

25:06.760 --> 25:12.588
They look upon me as a sort of spreading disease that can't be stopped.

25:13.469 --> 25:21.720
And a review of the particular viciousness of the one in PW is not

25:21.987 --> 25:23.569
It's not unusual for me.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.712
It's not uncommon.

25:26.072 --> 25:31.138
But do you think that part of it is due to some of these factors I suggested earlier?

25:31.879 --> 25:37.346
But you see, I don't think it's even... I would like to think that it was only because of that.

25:37.867 --> 25:40.911
That I had written something in a book that really pissed them off.

25:41.011 --> 25:44.395
Ellen James, you know, pissed people off.

25:44.415 --> 25:47.279
That's true.

25:47.299 --> 25:47.539
That's true.

25:47.705 --> 25:50.368
cutting out their tongues.

25:51.068 --> 25:51.949
I mean, you know what?

25:52.350 --> 25:54.612
You see, that's with anything.

25:54.852 --> 25:56.854
It hurts because it's so close to the truth.

25:56.874 --> 26:00.938
You do have fanatical people who do insane things.

26:00.958 --> 26:04.362
And there are words that you use even in this book I wrote down.

26:04.382 --> 26:08.166
I mean, you use moronic, idiocy.

26:08.186 --> 26:10.748
I was looking for all the synonyms of stupidity.

26:10.909 --> 26:11.950
I mean, you see it.

26:12.310 --> 26:16.294
You call it by any number of different names, but you call it...

26:16.544 --> 26:21.691
You know, I mean, that is confrontational to some people, perhaps.

26:22.251 --> 26:25.756
No, I agree with you.

26:28.619 --> 26:44.880
But you see, I think that a part of the problem, I would like to think that behind every angry... I would like to think that behind every ugly review I get,

26:45.552 --> 26:48.515
is someone that I have personally made angry.

26:49.416 --> 26:58.205
I would like to think that they'd actually read something of mine that was deeply offensive to them and that just worried the hell out of them and they just had an axe to grind.

26:59.307 --> 27:14.783
And while I think sometimes that's the case, sadly, I think the source of the anger is lazier than the experience of the real reading of a real book.

27:15.067 --> 27:21.436
and the real dislike of scenes or passages in a book.

27:21.456 --> 27:31.431
And when I say lazy, what I mean is I think the reaction is knee-jerk to a very superficial sense of who I am.

27:31.872 --> 27:43.369
People who didn't read the last two books, people who only read too many good reviews of one of my books, or I was on the bestsellers for too many weeks, and they're just

27:44.277 --> 27:45.640
They're ticked off at the attention.

27:46.462 --> 27:55.842
How many of my colleagues, and I write a column, so it's not really a review, and I only write about the ones I like.

27:56.063 --> 27:58.969
I have this luxury where I pick what I want to write about.

27:59.891 --> 28:03.940
But how many critics are going to like Pat Conroy's new book?

28:04.544 --> 28:14.258
I mean, they are offended that the man is so popular and that so many people like him that he has to be this commercial writer, when he's a wonderful writer, he's a great storyteller.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.461
But, you know, you'll see that.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.023
You'll see that happen.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.045
Yeah, I think that.

28:19.105 --> 28:20.467
That they refuse to recognize.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.912
Just tell me one quick thing about the importance of storytelling to you.

28:24.833 --> 28:33.606
I mean, we talked about literary this and literary that and what you're trying to accomplish by that route.

28:33.923 --> 28:38.947
We still have to engage the person to entertain and give them their money for it.

28:39.228 --> 28:44.072
I think entertain is the key because, and when I say entertain, I don't mean only comically.

28:44.212 --> 28:53.901
I do mean comically, but I mean, I think we're also entertained... Well, a lot of Karenians are entertained, but... Yeah, I think we're entertained when we're afraid.

28:54.121 --> 28:59.085
I think we're entertained when we must find out what happens.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.289
You know, the...

29:03.910 --> 29:13.278
Stephen Cain clearly knows how to entertain, and his entertainment takes a very different form than mine, but he's an excellent entertainer.

29:13.959 --> 29:18.382
And what I mean by that is he gets the audience's attention.

29:20.244 --> 29:32.955
And 40 or 50 pages into a book, you are not nearly as engaged and motivated as you will be

29:34.184 --> 29:35.946
400 pages into a book.

29:35.966 --> 29:51.286
That, to me, is the key of storytelling, is that if the story is good, if the storytelling is working, you may be interested on page 40, but you have to be very interested on page 400.

29:51.486 --> 29:53.349
Otherwise, you don't finish the book.

29:53.970 --> 29:54.831
You know, you've got to be there.

29:55.371 --> 30:01.980
And because the point is, you don't have bestsellers that people don't finish.

30:03.412 --> 30:05.875
That's how you have a bestseller.

30:05.895 --> 30:13.326
You've never said in your life to a close friend of yours, you've got to read this book when you're only 20 pages into it.

30:13.346 --> 30:18.994
You only say that to your four best friends who are also readers about a book you finished.

30:19.535 --> 30:21.017
That's when you really feel strongly.

30:21.698 --> 30:29.409
And that's what sells books, not ads in the New York Times Book Review or even front page reviews in the New York Times Book Review.

30:29.729 --> 30:31.832
A front page review in the New York Times Book Review

30:32.099 --> 30:34.301
might put you on the bestseller list for a week.

30:35.282 --> 30:41.609
But the only thing that's going to keep you there, you know, for 10, 12 weeks and counting, is word of mouth.

30:41.629 --> 30:44.492
And there's no word of mouth when people don't finish a book.

30:45.633 --> 30:47.796
I'm convinced that was the case of The Name of the Roads.

30:49.357 --> 30:51.660
I mean, the first printing of that was 10,000.

30:52.921 --> 30:57.226
But they loved it on the front pages of the New York Times.

30:57.286 --> 30:58.988
And it took off after that.

30:59.628 --> 31:01.110
I think the jump start was...

31:01.664 --> 31:03.086
Hey, this looks pretty good.
