WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:02.152
Come on.

00:03.313 --> 00:06.357
I got a script, Governor, because time is so limited.

00:06.678 --> 00:07.379
Oh, my goodness.

00:07.859 --> 00:08.039
Okay.

00:08.300 --> 00:20.235
Anyway, for better or worse, this may well be one of the most studied campaigns of the 20th century, your campaign for the presidency.

00:20.456 --> 00:21.317
Yeah.

00:21.337 --> 00:24.381
I wonder, you had a 17-point lead.

00:24.401 --> 00:26.644
Have you had time to reflect?

00:26.664 --> 00:27.425
Let me say this.

00:27.585 --> 00:28.807
Poll leads are worthless.

00:28.827 --> 00:29.127
I mean,

00:29.900 --> 00:32.682
Jimmy Carter had an alleged 30-point lead, and he won by one point.

00:32.722 --> 00:34.044
I mean, these things are very artificial.

00:34.064 --> 00:35.605
We knew we'd get a bounce out of the convention.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.126
We knew he'd get a bounce out of the convention.

00:37.146 --> 00:40.489
We figured we'd come out of the whole process about even, and that's what happened.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.251
What happened?

00:43.491 --> 00:46.774
I thought we had a fine organization, superb fundraising.

00:47.675 --> 00:49.296
Our communications and media were not good.

00:50.718 --> 00:56.102
We didn't communicate effectively, nor did we deal effectively with the kind of negative campaign that was run against us.

00:56.122 --> 00:56.863
We knew it was coming.

00:56.903 --> 00:59.485
We had no question what they were going to do.

01:00.612 --> 01:02.954
You expected that?

01:03.015 --> 01:05.077
Sure, sure, no question about it.

01:05.097 --> 01:15.308
I mean, they were doing negative research on me for months up here, but we didn't do a very effective job of dealing with it, and we lost the election, and it's very unfortunate.

01:15.328 --> 01:20.373
Some people have suggested that maybe you could have brought some people in from Washington.

01:20.713 --> 01:21.054
We did.

01:21.074 --> 01:23.516
Do you have any regrets about running the campaign here from Boston?

01:23.536 --> 01:23.977
We did, we did.

01:23.997 --> 01:27.160
I mean, there were all kinds of people who were involved who came in from Washington.

01:27.815 --> 01:28.876
Kirk O'Donnell came up.

01:29.397 --> 01:30.918
We had all kinds of people.

01:31.239 --> 01:35.223
We had a Washington group who was deeply involved.

01:35.263 --> 01:42.131
We had people from the other Democratic campaigns who came in very soon after the primaries.

01:42.171 --> 01:48.558
I mean, some of my key big state coordinators were some of the best organizational people that the other primary candidates had had.

01:48.678 --> 01:56.387
So there was no lack of good people who weren't necessarily involved in the primary campaign who were

01:56.823 --> 01:59.866
Okay, people, but do you regret running it from Boston?

01:59.886 --> 02:02.869
No, no, no, I don't think the location needed it.

02:02.889 --> 02:03.870
A lot of people said it did.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.754
David Broder, I guess, and a few of the others, or whatever.

02:06.774 --> 02:07.775
It should have been in Washington.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.718
Well, that the campaign might have been right.

02:10.738 --> 02:14.281
I don't know that that would have been it.

02:14.301 --> 02:14.962
I mean, that wasn't the problem.

02:14.982 --> 02:22.010
They came at us with a very tough negative campaign, and we did not do a good job of dealing with it.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.912
Now, I've been through negative campaigns before.

02:23.952 --> 02:25.193
I'd lost one, and I'd won one.

02:26.287 --> 02:32.034
But this was one where we just did not do an effective job of dealing with him.

02:32.675 --> 02:35.418
Any thoughts on what you should have done, might have done?

02:35.959 --> 02:45.851
Well, I think most people in retrospect would say that I should have gone on the attack against Bush as soon as he started his attacks.

02:45.891 --> 02:55.163
I think that's, you know, I'm not sure even with the benefit of hindsight that you can exactly say what we should have done.

02:56.560 --> 03:10.199
It was my general sense that the American people were looking for a campaign that was positive, that was optimistic, that didn't deteriorate into a name-calling contest in June and July.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.363
But it didn't... That's the way we had... On one side.

03:13.864 --> 03:20.814
Yeah, that's the way we had run the primary campaign, and we got it very successfully, and we came out of that primary process in a very positive way.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.559
And so for a while...

03:25.484 --> 03:45.328
We chose to kind of go at our issues and try to continue to be positive and not engage in the kind of thing that seems to me turns people off, makes them even more cynical about the political process than in many cases people are, and so on.

03:45.388 --> 03:46.289
Obviously, it didn't work.

03:46.490 --> 03:51.115
I remember Mario Cuomo the other day said, look, I told Mike to forget about the negative stuff.

03:51.155 --> 03:52.437
I didn't think it would...

03:53.024 --> 03:53.865
And he did.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.569
Mara said, look, don't pay any attention to that.

03:56.589 --> 03:57.891
Do what you're doing and so on and so forth.

03:57.911 --> 03:59.433
He said, in retrospect, I was wrong.

04:00.695 --> 04:09.969
I remember towards the end of the campaign, I think you were in Texas, and you paraphrased Sam Rayburn to the effect that the people can smell the garbage and they know it when they smell it.

04:09.989 --> 04:12.913
Maybe a conservative, he said.

04:12.993 --> 04:13.915
And I remember cheering.

04:13.955 --> 04:16.378
I can smell garbage.

04:16.398 --> 04:19.603
Maybe that was, you know, in retrospect, that was too late.

04:19.623 --> 04:19.723
Okay.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.943
I mean, the Boston Harbor thing was as far as a $3 bill.

04:23.043 --> 04:27.969
I mean, we'd not only been cleaning this place up for four years, but the administration had done everything it could.

04:28.009 --> 04:31.533
First, we got no answers from it for five years.

04:31.553 --> 04:33.034
And I was out of office for four or five.

04:33.094 --> 04:42.445
And secondly, Mr. Bush was part of the crew that was trying to effectively eliminate federal support for the Clean Water Act.

04:42.885 --> 04:46.229
But we didn't do a very effective job of saying it or doing it.

04:46.249 --> 04:49.272
And I guess in retrospect, in retrospect,

04:49.724 --> 04:54.412
If somebody comes at you the way Bush came at me, you just got to go back at them.

04:54.432 --> 04:54.632
All right.

04:54.973 --> 04:56.475
It may not be the way you like the campaign.

04:56.515 --> 04:57.697
It's not the way I like the campaign.

04:57.717 --> 05:03.086
But I think that has to be one of the conclusions you draw from this.

05:03.206 --> 05:15.006
Now, what it does to the public attitude, this cynicism we have about politics in this country is serious, because I think people

05:16.910 --> 05:22.358
I mean, it adds to public cynicism, but on the other hand, we all know what happened.

05:22.378 --> 05:26.364
Have you reconsidered your assessment of the quality of the American electorate?

05:26.484 --> 05:27.025
No, no.

05:27.065 --> 05:27.846
The intelligence?

05:27.866 --> 05:29.589
I hate to ask it this way.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.951
It's a television age.

05:31.071 --> 05:42.569
Most people get their news from television, make their impressions based on what they're seeing out there, and it just means that you've got to deal with this kind of negative impact.

05:42.769 --> 05:44.892
You know what happened the other day in Colorado?

05:45.884 --> 05:47.486
So it was a big fight over a new airport.

05:47.927 --> 05:49.509
The governor and a lot of people were for it.

05:49.569 --> 05:51.072
Certain people against it went through.

05:51.092 --> 05:52.734
The people who were against it went through.

05:52.754 --> 05:53.615
Overwhelming them.

05:53.635 --> 05:55.258
The people who were against it hired Ailes.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.983
Ailes became an issue in the campaign.

05:59.003 --> 06:05.413
They used Ailes negatively against the anti-airport people.

06:06.394 --> 06:08.377
And apparently it worked.

06:08.397 --> 06:10.440
Just a parenthetical thing.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.383
Joe McGuinness is a friend of mine.

06:12.543 --> 06:15.227
He did the book where they introduced Roger Ailes.

06:15.568 --> 06:15.688
Right.

06:16.158 --> 06:28.049
and this was kind of off the record, but he said at the beginning, even long before you were even one of the front runners, Dale said, well, I'd like Dukakis.

06:28.729 --> 06:29.370
And he said, why?

06:29.390 --> 06:32.193
He said, well, I'll find something.

06:33.053 --> 06:35.055
I mean, look, the technique is as old as this.

06:35.095 --> 06:35.756
I'll find something.

06:35.836 --> 06:45.945
It's getting to be, I mean, you pick out certain things in a particular individual's record, you know, which in many cases are either badly distorted

06:46.297 --> 06:48.420
Or relatively unimportant, you know?

06:49.361 --> 06:52.305
And you just, I mean, he did it with, who was the guy?

06:52.425 --> 06:57.672
Huddleston in Kentucky, who had missed some roll call votes or something.

06:57.692 --> 07:01.237
And he had a dog sniffing around looking for Huddleston.

07:01.257 --> 07:02.719
So this guy, Mitch McConnell, you know?

07:02.819 --> 07:05.503
And Huddleston was 30 points ahead, I mean, over here for granted.

07:05.523 --> 07:07.325
And he never responded to the dog ad.

07:09.027 --> 07:14.835
And apparently, I mean, I think I'm correct in saying Huddleston's roll call record was actually quite good, you know?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.205
But he had missed a few or something.

07:17.225 --> 07:17.726
I don't know what it was.

07:17.746 --> 07:18.887
And McConnell beat Huddleston.

07:18.907 --> 07:23.393
I mean, that's the classic kind of heavy television negative.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.417
What happens now to campaigning with this negative?

07:26.598 --> 07:33.487
This is a case of a president being elected who did not run for anything, but he ran against Michael Katakis.

07:33.507 --> 07:36.792
I think what it means is that you're going to see a lot more of this.

07:36.812 --> 07:41.999
I mean, in the three congressional races that have taken place so far, the Democrats have won two out of three, right?

07:42.019 --> 07:43.641
In Indiana, Alabama, and Wyoming.

07:44.043 --> 07:45.686
The Democrats didn't hesitate for one minute.

07:45.706 --> 07:48.230
They came out of the box shooting.

07:48.250 --> 07:48.611
And they won.

07:49.652 --> 07:50.894
So this is the way it's going to be.

07:51.095 --> 07:51.716
Gloves off?

07:52.737 --> 07:53.098
I guess.

07:54.640 --> 08:05.278
But you can't, you know, it's pretty obvious based on my experience that you cannot let the kinds of lies and distortions that were being peddled off the ground.

08:05.378 --> 08:06.580
I mean, for two days.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.004
If you do, you're going to be hurt.

08:09.592 --> 08:10.993
You were in the White House last night.

08:11.474 --> 08:16.138
They made a big deal out of it on Today Hill this morning.

08:16.158 --> 08:18.440
He asked me what I was going to ask the president for.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.281
He said, money for Boston Harbor.

08:20.301 --> 08:21.462
He zeroed it out.

08:21.482 --> 08:22.823
Did you get a chance to chat?

08:22.964 --> 08:23.864
Yeah, sure, a little bit.

08:23.884 --> 08:26.407
And we talked when he was at BU Sunday.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.010
But Bill Riley, the EPA administrator, was at my table.

08:30.090 --> 08:34.013
So I said, when do I get my money?

08:34.073 --> 08:37.436
Maybe it's a silly question, but what were your feelings in there?

08:37.476 --> 08:38.297
Any feelings?

08:39.238 --> 08:39.598
You've got to be.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.255
I've grown up about this.

08:41.275 --> 08:44.760
I mean, this is the 11th dinner that Gillian had.

08:45.200 --> 08:51.490
I've got to confess, last year we were looking the place over with a little more interest than we had in the past.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.494
But we had a good time, and they had good people in the industry.

08:54.514 --> 09:00.003
I guess we all want to know, I mean, you still didn't do that badly.

09:00.363 --> 09:06.953
I mean, we came within, what, a three-point swing?

09:07.270 --> 09:08.271
A dozen states.

09:08.331 --> 09:11.054
You keyed on those states and had they... There was a dozen.

09:11.414 --> 09:12.455
There was three points.

09:13.136 --> 09:13.656
Three points.

09:14.457 --> 09:14.958
The other way.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.301
Could have been a different... And it would have been a different result.

09:18.321 --> 09:20.903
But you're a competitor.

09:21.063 --> 09:21.644
You're a fighter.

09:23.326 --> 09:25.408
You're winding up this term as governor.

09:26.849 --> 09:27.810
Then what?

09:28.110 --> 09:28.571
Yeah.

09:28.591 --> 09:29.952
Well, look, I've got a job to do here.

09:30.092 --> 09:32.795
We obviously have some fiscal problems, fortunately.

09:32.815 --> 09:33.996
I mean, they're serious.

09:34.457 --> 09:35.978
Some of our neighbors are even more serious.

09:36.835 --> 09:39.037
I'm looking at Connecticut these days and New Jersey and some of these places.

09:39.057 --> 09:41.019
We've got to deal with that, and I intend it.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.202
And I want to walk out of here with a state of solid shape.

09:44.222 --> 09:45.203
And then we'll see, Nick.

09:45.223 --> 09:47.886
I mean, it's one of these, you never say never.

09:47.926 --> 09:52.350
On the other hand, it's one of these things where you just can't plan too far ahead.

09:52.370 --> 09:54.973
And at this point, I've been in politics for 30 years.

09:55.073 --> 10:02.320
I've been governor of a great state for twice as long as anybody in the last 150 years.

10:02.907 --> 10:08.213
My party's nominee for the presidency, you know, came close to the top of the mountain, not quite.

10:08.233 --> 10:15.702
And, you know, both Kitty and I are still young and energetic, enjoying our granddaughter.

10:16.443 --> 10:17.624
You're not ruling it out, in other words.

10:17.764 --> 10:19.066
No, I don't think you're ruling anything out.

10:19.086 --> 10:27.075
But at this point, I want to do my job as governor, do it well, and finish up in good, solid shape, and then we'll see.

10:27.393 --> 10:32.240
I'm writing the magazine piece, and Ted is doing something for the Daily.

10:32.521 --> 10:40.172
And so he does have a few specific questions that relate to the Greek community, and maybe I could fire one at you for him.

10:40.392 --> 10:46.962
What is your impression, Your Excellency, from this last campaign, from the Greek-American community?

10:46.982 --> 10:48.904
Are you satisfied with the response you got?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.108
I'd say two things.

10:51.168 --> 10:54.733
First, the response was unbelievable, just overwhelming.

10:55.777 --> 10:57.899
And it was a wonderful thing to see and feel.

10:59.361 --> 11:09.252
I cannot express to you quite the emotions that I sensed and I felt and my family felt.

11:09.412 --> 11:17.281
That rally in Astoria had to be one of the most, and it was one of many.

11:17.301 --> 11:24.990
And I mean everything from the rally in Astoria to going into a small town in Iowa where there's one Greek family running the pizza place and walking in.

11:25.325 --> 11:27.848
speaking Greek and so forth.

11:28.309 --> 11:40.245
The second thing is that my impression is that, or at least I've been told this, that the campaign really united the Greek community, the Greek-American community, in a very special way.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.508
It had not happened in a long time.

11:42.528 --> 11:46.052
People really rallied around, and it was terrific to see.

11:46.072 --> 11:50.098
Do you know what Greek name I gave you in one of my pieces?

11:50.118 --> 11:51.720
The Great Alejandro.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.442
The Great Alejandro.

11:53.708 --> 11:56.211
I received such a great response.

11:56.331 --> 11:57.132
I didn't get pneumonia.

11:59.735 --> 12:00.315
For a swim.

12:02.057 --> 12:16.373
Mr. Governor, some leaders of the Greek American community during your campaign, we are not as supportive as they should be.

12:16.393 --> 12:17.394
Do you feel bitter about that?

12:17.434 --> 12:17.975
Not many.

12:18.355 --> 12:19.036
On the contrary.

12:19.076 --> 12:20.858
I mean, I thought the support was overwhelming.

12:20.878 --> 12:21.859
I mean, look, you're not going to get it.

12:22.396 --> 12:36.655
100% support no matter who you are, but I thought it was just... Specifically, how did you feel when you saw your spiritual about his eminence applauding enthusiastically Mr. Booth during the... But at the convention?

12:36.675 --> 12:36.815
Yes.

12:36.915 --> 12:37.716
Well, that's a judgment.

12:37.876 --> 12:38.738
No, no, no.

12:39.519 --> 12:40.380
Look, he's invited.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.623
I think he has a responsibility to go.

12:43.544 --> 12:46.388
I mean, there wasn't any question about where his eminence was.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.513
I mean, he was about as helpful and supportive as any...

12:51.455 --> 12:56.141
clergy could possibly be consistent with his responsibilities.

12:56.161 --> 12:58.604
Did you think maybe you should have had him in Atlanta, though?

12:59.144 --> 13:01.387
Was that kind of a coup for them to have him in Atlanta?

13:01.427 --> 13:03.970
Was the Archbishop with us?

13:03.990 --> 13:04.591
Yes, he was.

13:04.891 --> 13:05.432
In Atlanta?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.573
Yes, he was.

13:06.594 --> 13:09.737
They stuck him right on the stage, though, the Republican stage.

13:11.179 --> 13:14.643
He was in the box with my family, right?

13:14.663 --> 13:15.184
Yes, he was.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.905
The impression that was given during the Republican convention was that he allowed himself to be used.

13:22.826 --> 13:26.930
If he had refused, then what people would have said?

13:26.950 --> 13:27.971
What would they have said, you know?

13:27.991 --> 13:33.696
But given the fact that you were the first Greek American running for the presidency ever.

13:34.076 --> 13:37.519
Yeah, but I don't think that's it.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.221
I don't think that was a factor.

13:39.261 --> 13:40.542
No, and he was terrific.

13:40.742 --> 13:42.523
I mean, I cannot say enough for him.

13:42.744 --> 13:44.445
He's always been very close to our family.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.217
He was my parish priest when I was a kid.

13:47.238 --> 13:52.328
He's been very supportive and very encouraging, and he was this time.

13:52.408 --> 13:54.492
Any assessment on the Bush?

13:55.454 --> 13:56.416
I think it's still too early.

13:56.897 --> 13:59.302
I'm not a hundred days fan.

13:59.322 --> 14:02.569
I think you've got to give a new administration seven or eight months to get...

14:03.140 --> 14:03.521
get underway.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.504
I mean, obviously they've had some problems getting started.

14:05.884 --> 14:06.846
They seem to be off balance.

14:06.866 --> 14:11.173
Yeah, but these are supposed to be the pros, ready to hit the ground running, to use the cliche.

14:11.193 --> 14:13.957
You know, I mean, in fairness to Bush, I don't think he's a hundred days guy.

14:14.117 --> 14:18.064
I think he's trying to build a foundation now.

14:18.084 --> 14:20.608
You know, I mean, there's some obvious problems there.

14:20.628 --> 14:27.719
His first white fight with the Congress is going to be over 30 cent difference of opinion on the minimum wage.

14:27.739 --> 14:30.463
You know, the Alaska thing was

14:31.203 --> 14:34.667
I heard your comment that night at the Alpha Omega dinner, though.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.250
What did Jay Leno line about?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.272
Yeah, wonderful line.

14:38.292 --> 14:41.135
Fish in the harbor.

14:41.155 --> 14:42.957
Boston Harbor doesn't look so bad now.

14:42.978 --> 14:43.458
No, no.

14:43.478 --> 14:44.660
Fish in the harbor.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.084
Fish in the harbor looking better and better every day.

14:48.104 --> 14:55.573
What I'm concerned about is our willingness and our ability

14:56.347 --> 15:04.199
to seize the initiative internationally at a time when it seems to me our values are in the ascendancy.

15:06.823 --> 15:20.303
Why is it that Gorbachev seems to be the initiator, the driving force behind so much of these new ideas around the United States?

15:20.864 --> 15:23.788
I mean, it's democracy that's breaking out all over the place.

15:24.562 --> 15:36.394
And if he's serious about cutting conventional forces in Eastern Europe back to parity with NATO, we ought to be out there leading the charge.

15:36.414 --> 15:39.717
I mean, you've got to be careful.

15:39.737 --> 15:44.202
You've got to make sure that it's a step-by-step process.

15:45.403 --> 15:50.248
There's inspection and verification every step of the way.

15:52.017 --> 15:56.901
And we cannot let ourselves get into situations where people like Norieger are coming their nose at us.

15:58.303 --> 16:01.986
To get back to the campaign, were you overconfident?

16:02.486 --> 16:02.606
No.

16:03.808 --> 16:06.910
You never were overconfident about the presidency of the United States.

16:06.930 --> 16:11.294
Remember what I said at the beginning, it was a very, very, very long shot.

16:11.314 --> 16:15.778
I mean, the fact that we did as well as we did at the time, I thought it was remarkable.

16:15.798 --> 16:19.982
Pretty much it won it by April.

16:21.143 --> 16:22.145
I mean, that was remarkable.

16:22.165 --> 16:24.007
I mean, who was I, you know?

16:24.028 --> 16:28.535
I started, you know, one and a half percent in the polls.

16:28.555 --> 16:28.735
Amazing.

16:28.935 --> 16:30.598
You know, the failure was after the convention.

16:30.618 --> 16:33.903
I mean, we had a good run through the convention.

16:33.963 --> 16:39.512
We weren't ready for the kind of attack, the attacks that came, and we should have been.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.615
However, you did say that you anticipated it.

16:41.655 --> 16:49.227
Yeah, but we just, whatever, you know, we just didn't have a strategy for dealing with it.

16:50.692 --> 16:51.875
How about the media?

16:51.895 --> 16:53.157
How would you assess their performance?

16:53.218 --> 17:09.493
Well, I don't have a problem with media, except to say that one of the things that you learn in a presidential campaign, especially after the convention, is that in this television age,

17:12.865 --> 17:16.611
what happens on television and how you deal with it is very important.

17:16.631 --> 17:31.233
Now that, you know, I've been dealing with television all my life, but the difference between running for presidency as the nominee and running, say, for governorship is that you have an opportunity as a candidate for governor to be out there touching base with people out on the street and so on and so forth.

17:31.293 --> 17:32.635
You can't do that.

17:32.655 --> 17:33.115
You can't do that.

17:33.135 --> 17:41.488
I mean, you're surrounded by a wall of national reporters and you move with that crew and everything you do is basically recorded, you know, for

17:42.245 --> 17:45.709
I mean, you can't have the kind of contact with... But do they give you a fair shake?

17:45.749 --> 17:49.473
I mean, do you think... Yeah, I don't think... Do you think they really played up the negative attacks, or do they have to?

17:49.493 --> 17:57.782
Well, you know, I mean... But look, it's the responsibility of the candidates and the candidates' campaign to deal with that, first and foremost.

17:58.022 --> 18:01.546
So they were reporting... But I don't think they were unfair.

18:01.927 --> 18:03.448
Did you have one more you wanted to ask?

18:03.689 --> 18:04.650
Because we're running out of time.

18:05.711 --> 18:09.555
Well... You wanted to ask one about Papandreou, I think.

18:10.456 --> 18:10.796
Yeah.

18:10.877 --> 18:12.218
I'm very sure that...

18:13.210 --> 18:18.978
Like all of us, you have written, Your Excellency, of what's going on with the provincial government.

18:19.419 --> 18:24.025
I have this gentleman in the Salem, Salem County Jail.

18:25.868 --> 18:31.776
Indeed.

18:32.498 --> 18:34.240
Without Bale, at all, I think.

18:34.300 --> 18:41.606
He doesn't want to leave.

18:41.786 --> 18:56.619
Mr. Lukakis, do you feel that all these standards have a negative portrait, a negative image on Greece in its period?

18:56.639 --> 18:56.839
Yes.

18:57.019 --> 18:59.902
Does it affect you personally?

18:59.942 --> 19:01.543
It must affect me personally, but it does.

19:02.165 --> 19:13.039
If you talk to people in the Congress who are friends of Greece, and especially the Greek Americans in Congress, they'll tell you that it's made the job of advocating for Greece more difficult.

19:13.660 --> 19:14.341
No question.

19:14.361 --> 19:18.346
And of course elections are coming up in less than a month.

19:18.907 --> 19:19.547
What do you hear?

19:19.567 --> 19:23.513
What do you... I don't have a sense of what's happening in Greece.

19:23.573 --> 19:27.878
All I can tell you is that it certainly has affected the ability of our friends in Congress.

19:28.579 --> 19:29.320
Do you love Greece?

19:30.008 --> 19:53.546
I love Greece and I want to see Greece do well and I want the United States to be very supportive of Greece and that means that we need an atmosphere within which those of us who can advocate for Greece, who want a settlement and an end to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus can effectively lobby for that.

19:53.566 --> 19:57.012
It's much more difficult if

19:57.329 --> 20:03.158
Rightly or wrongly, people perceive that Greece is awash in scandal and all the rest of it.

20:03.258 --> 20:12.732
Do you feel that Papandreou's period sort of people made things difficult for us here?

20:12.752 --> 20:13.793
I'm not going to place blame.

20:13.853 --> 20:21.505
All I can say is that the current situation in Greece has made things very difficult for those of us who have strong supporters of Greece.

20:21.525 --> 20:24.910
Your Excellency, you are very supportive of the cyber system.

20:24.930 --> 20:25.210
Yeah.

20:25.696 --> 20:33.788
I had some rather strong things to say about Cyprus at the association meeting in New York.

20:33.808 --> 20:43.101
But again, it's most helpful when... What we are doing wrong for the Cyprus issue for so many years.

20:43.401 --> 20:44.483
What's happened?

20:44.803 --> 20:46.145
What we are doing wrong.

20:46.226 --> 20:48.649
The first thing that happened was that we let it happen.

20:49.793 --> 20:51.515
We let it happen?

20:51.535 --> 20:58.463
There's no secret about Kissinger's antagonism toward the Macarius, who was the only person in Cyprus at the time who could keep those two communities together.

20:59.104 --> 21:02.668
Kissinger referred to Macarius as the Castro of the Eastern Mediterranean, remember?

21:03.509 --> 21:08.615
And, you know, that was, the United States could have stopped that occupation, and we chose not to.

21:10.157 --> 21:17.826
And the Archbishop almost lost his life, the circumstances, and it was a very sad,

21:18.127 --> 21:28.977
Let me ask one wrap-up question, upbeat question, about a reflective question on what you feel your candidacy accomplished.

21:31.059 --> 21:35.384
Well, I think in the Greek community, despite the loss, there was an enormous amount of pride.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.826
And we all felt it.

21:39.087 --> 21:42.070
And you could just sense it.

21:42.090 --> 21:46.294
And it was a pride that we felt as Greek Americans, I think, a great many

21:46.949 --> 21:51.474
first and second generation Americans of all ethnic backgrounds felt it.

21:51.494 --> 21:52.576
And it's what America's all about.

21:53.076 --> 21:55.700
A lot of disappointment, too, when I lost.

21:57.081 --> 22:02.808
And I feel sad about that because I'm very proud of my heritage.

22:02.928 --> 22:08.075
And I was very proud of the community and what it did and the way it responded.

22:08.095 --> 22:15.083
But the sense I have is that despite the disappointment, people still feel that it was

22:15.586 --> 22:18.370
It was a worthwhile effort, and they felt proud to be a part of it.

22:19.331 --> 22:22.997
And it was just a terrific experience.

22:23.017 --> 22:28.645
You can answer this yes or no, but did it hurt as much as losing to King did?

22:28.665 --> 22:29.065
It hurt.

22:30.888 --> 22:33.351
You never go into the presidency assuming you're going to win it.

22:33.832 --> 22:37.417
I mean, you know it's the toughest battle you can ever face politically.

22:37.477 --> 22:38.919
So I mean, I knew that from the beginning.

22:40.602 --> 22:45.188
But when you work as hard as we all worked for two years, obviously, you know,

22:46.552 --> 22:50.362
very disappointed when you don't win, particularly when you come that close.

22:50.583 --> 22:51.224
And no regrets.

22:51.866 --> 22:52.768
No regrets about running.

22:53.249 --> 22:54.874
Regrets about losing.

22:54.894 --> 22:55.295
Okay?

22:55.315 --> 22:56.157
That's great.
