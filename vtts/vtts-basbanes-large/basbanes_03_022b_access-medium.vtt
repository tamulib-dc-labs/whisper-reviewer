00:02.579 --> 00:16.440
I found this great letter from you, Scott, to Nixon, asking him to reconsider what he's owning.

00:18.243 --> 00:18.623
From who?

00:18.683 --> 00:21.528
From you, Scott.

00:22.068 --> 00:24.612
I love that one.

00:24.672 --> 00:31.843
How about this close?

00:32.228 --> 00:32.849
This close.

00:34.211 --> 00:48.210
It came from one of the congressmen, one of the Republican congressmen, who first term is... So the years of your museum, Bob, were when?

00:48.290 --> 00:49.411
What were the years of your museum?

00:49.471 --> 00:52.456
It opened in 99, and it just closed.

00:52.576 --> 00:53.537
And were you living down there?

00:53.757 --> 00:55.780
No, I lived down there for 18 months doing the museum.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.262
And so why did you pick Florida for it?

00:57.462 --> 00:57.963
They picked me.

00:58.003 --> 01:01.628
I was on Dateline, and they saw it in a college...

01:02.300 --> 01:10.470
She loved to eat.

01:10.951 --> 01:17.459
Part of Mr. Lincoln ate every meal out for 35 years.

01:17.519 --> 01:19.301
Her refrigerator was a joke.

01:19.321 --> 01:20.483
You looked in it, it had nothing.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.493
She'd like to eat every meal out.

01:29.080 --> 01:48.945
This, oh this.

01:48.993 --> 01:52.940
This is the original photograph.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.265
John John under the desk.

01:55.465 --> 01:57.950
I have a letter from Mrs. Lincoln, even Cecil Stoughton.

01:58.330 --> 02:04.001
It's Cecil Stoughton and Stanley Trettick, shoulder to shoulder, looking down, and they knew John John was under the desk.

02:04.021 --> 02:05.764
I got the whole story from Stoughton.

02:05.784 --> 02:07.267
And he said Trettick and I were waiting.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.613
And he said we thought he was going to pop up.

02:10.981 --> 02:11.762
and we're going to take a picture.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.465
All of a sudden, the door opens, and they went, boom, boom, boom.

02:14.485 --> 02:15.706
They took the picture.

02:15.726 --> 02:22.774
And even Credic just died, but Cecil Stoughton said, I don't know if that's mine or his, because they're identical.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.556
But he said, how in the hell did you get that?

02:24.576 --> 02:26.238
He said, I gave it to Mrs. Lincoln for the president.

02:26.258 --> 02:27.199
Well, then that's the answer.

02:27.219 --> 02:28.201
Yeah.

02:28.221 --> 02:29.082
It's just never made it.

02:30.703 --> 02:30.884
Isn't it?

02:30.904 --> 02:31.685
Here, look.

02:31.705 --> 02:33.046
Here it is.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.067
Yeah, I displayed with the letter.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.550
So, read it there.

02:36.817 --> 02:42.030
This famous picture of President John F. Kennedy sitting at his desk in the Oval Office with his son John Jr.

02:42.171 --> 02:51.113
emerging from a door underneath, which you now have in your possession, was framed and hung in Kennedy's small room near the Oval Office until November 23rd,

02:51.346 --> 02:53.369
1963, when it was removed.

02:53.389 --> 02:56.433
And the letter's dated June 5, 1992.

02:56.453 --> 02:57.935
She still used White House stationary.

02:58.115 --> 02:59.437
Yeah, everything I have is White House.

02:59.457 --> 03:00.598
I have her stationary.

03:00.618 --> 03:00.839
Yeah.

03:01.419 --> 03:05.084
I mean, she's out of it for 30 years, almost, and she's still using White House stationary.

03:05.104 --> 03:06.786
Seriously, this is the big, long banner.

03:06.806 --> 03:12.935
It says Kennedy and Johnson, but I have pictures of it hung over the Coliseum.

03:13.435 --> 03:14.817
And I've got pictures of it.

03:14.837 --> 03:15.598
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

03:15.798 --> 03:20.643
But Stoughton blew his mind when he saw that.

03:21.504 --> 03:21.905
Oh, I bet.

03:23.106 --> 03:24.828
It was a real honor to take him to the museum.

03:25.449 --> 03:25.549
Oh.

03:28.152 --> 03:31.015
So why did you close the exhibit, or was it just a five-year gig?

03:31.035 --> 03:31.576
It was five years.

03:31.596 --> 03:33.337
They had it, you know, and they just wanted to move on.

03:33.358 --> 03:35.099
I think they're going to close the museum.

03:35.119 --> 03:37.042
Uh-huh.

03:37.062 --> 03:38.183
And how many visitors did they have?

03:38.203 --> 03:39.424
These are the signing portraits.

03:39.444 --> 03:41.406
These are the ones that you actually sign on the bottom.

03:41.767 --> 03:41.907
Uh-huh.

03:43.152 --> 03:44.315
They're all originals.

03:44.335 --> 03:48.785
I got the stash of all Mrs. Lincoln's remaining stuff.

03:48.805 --> 03:49.066
Look at that.

03:49.086 --> 03:52.634
And all these quantities, 400, 500.

03:52.654 --> 03:56.503
Yeah, these were signed by him, or he didn't put the auto pin on them?

03:56.855 --> 03:58.277
had his little desk calendar.

03:58.457 --> 03:59.959
And these are the sheets.

03:59.979 --> 04:01.461
There's 700 of those.

04:02.062 --> 04:03.865
But I got these with duels all over them and all that.

04:04.025 --> 04:06.929
But I've sold these for 100 a piece.

04:07.590 --> 04:10.414
Isn't this something?

04:10.695 --> 04:16.563
Are most of the pictures of Kennedy or Kennedy with Jackie or of the photographs that you have?

04:16.663 --> 04:20.669
I mean, I can't think of what I want to do.

04:20.749 --> 04:23.132
This is kind of cool.

04:30.436 --> 04:35.343
This right here is the original file.

04:36.305 --> 04:40.711
And this didn't come from Mrs. Lincoln, but this is the original file ordering all of Joe Kennedy's stationery.

04:41.973 --> 04:44.376
And there's all samples of his stationery with a guy.

04:44.396 --> 04:45.498
That's his older, his brother.

04:45.818 --> 04:45.999
No.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.441
No, Joe's father.

04:47.461 --> 04:47.841
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:48.843 --> 04:52.087
I thought you meant, not Joe Junior, the father, the ambassador.

04:52.228 --> 04:53.730
Mrs. Lincoln kept him like this.

04:53.910 --> 04:56.474
This is her file with her writing on it.

04:56.494 --> 04:57.355
And these are all...

04:58.482 --> 05:00.064
very unusual telegram station.

05:01.745 --> 05:11.515
That whole box is filled with hundreds and hundreds of morning cards, letters.

05:11.655 --> 05:13.157
She had everything for every occasion.

05:14.098 --> 05:17.761
Well, she used it.

05:17.822 --> 05:19.143
Did she have a staff of people?

05:19.984 --> 05:20.224
No.

05:21.065 --> 05:22.466
I don't know how the woman did what she did.

05:22.506 --> 05:23.727
She was a one-woman operation.

05:23.828 --> 05:25.249
It was really surprising.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.474
It's hard to imagine.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.435
Yeah, imagine that today, right?

05:27.575 --> 05:30.098
And they got all the word fries up there, too.

05:30.179 --> 05:31.700
And she rang everything up in the manual.

05:32.141 --> 05:34.464
And back in the day, those are dental pools.

05:34.864 --> 05:36.566
But you know what, probably?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.529
She didn't want to share.

05:38.549 --> 05:39.490
She didn't want to share.

05:39.630 --> 05:47.800
When she went into the White House, Kennedy said to her and her husband, I want you to move in the White House.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.101
I want you to live here.

05:49.121 --> 05:51.004
And she was, like, honored.

05:51.024 --> 05:53.106
And Abe, you have to know him.

05:53.126 --> 05:53.847
He's really a cool guy.

05:54.248 --> 05:54.628
He went.

05:55.537 --> 06:03.168
Mr. President, with all due respect, you have my wife almost 18 hours a day.

06:03.329 --> 06:03.769
I warn her.

06:04.450 --> 06:05.832
And he said, we're going to live off.

06:05.852 --> 06:07.295
And he said, I respect that.

06:07.595 --> 06:10.039
But he said, you have to let me put a phone in next to your bed.

06:10.059 --> 06:11.501
And that phone rings any time.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.183
When did she start with him?

06:13.203 --> 06:14.766
53, September of 53.

06:15.567 --> 06:22.337
So oddly enough, funny story is that picture I showed you, me and my tank, that's September 11th, 1953.

06:22.992 --> 06:26.136
September 12th, they get married, and Mrs. Lincoln works for them.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.842
So it's like right on the hill there, and I'm in the Smithsonian, and we all kind of tie in later.

06:29.862 --> 06:30.483
It's kind of funny.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.006
It doesn't just happen in that picture.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.328
When did Mary work for Kennedy?

06:34.729 --> 06:37.753
When everyone took vacations?

06:38.073 --> 06:39.395
They interchange a little bit.

06:40.577 --> 06:43.481
They work together at one point, but then Mary takes over the secretary.

06:44.102 --> 06:50.151
Janet DeRuers was the first secretary for Kennedy, and she got sick, and then Mrs. Lincoln took over and was a flyer.

06:50.171 --> 06:52.594
She actually was secretary for another senator.

06:52.692 --> 06:53.653
And she was a staunch.

06:53.673 --> 06:55.876
Her father was a Republican congressman.

06:55.896 --> 06:59.041
So for her to work with her Democrat was horrible in those days.

06:59.061 --> 07:02.265
And she went and for nothing worked on Kennedy's staff for a while.

07:02.926 --> 07:03.487
He liked her.

07:03.547 --> 07:04.328
She liked him.

07:04.388 --> 07:09.195
And said, look, he came in one day and he goes, okay, you want to be my personal secretary?

07:09.275 --> 07:10.617
So she put her other job and went with him.

07:10.732 --> 07:11.514
Mm-hmm.

07:11.715 --> 07:14.242
You know that picture of them in the car?

07:14.643 --> 07:14.743
Yeah.

07:14.763 --> 07:15.947
There's a picture of them in the car.

07:15.967 --> 07:16.789
Yeah, the four of them.

07:16.809 --> 07:18.052
Yeah, the four of them, yeah.

07:18.072 --> 07:21.642
That was the first day of January of 1953 when they went over the Senate.

07:21.662 --> 07:25.112
Right, yeah, and Mary, and then...

07:25.784 --> 07:28.707
Yeah, Mary worked for him before the senatorial.

07:28.727 --> 07:29.547
He worked as a congressman.

07:29.567 --> 07:30.849
Right, there were a lot of people working for him.

07:30.869 --> 07:36.013
Right, and so Mary was working for him as a congressman, gave up the job because she wanted to marry Ray, and Evelyn comes over.

07:36.053 --> 07:37.134
That's what it is.

07:37.154 --> 07:37.555
Right.

07:37.575 --> 07:40.677
She gives up the job, and Evelyn comes in because she marries Ray.

07:40.798 --> 07:43.440
Yeah, she was working for a guy named Forrest.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.962
Right, and Mary marries Ray and wants to have kids.

07:46.002 --> 07:46.483
That's right.

07:50.406 --> 07:50.967
Good word.

07:52.508 --> 07:53.089
Do that again.

07:54.310 --> 07:54.630
Okay.

07:54.650 --> 07:55.791
I feel that if I didn't collect

07:56.851 --> 08:03.657
and all this around you that you see, I wouldn't have anything... You'd be prefaced up by saying you've got two wonderful children.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.619
Yeah, I have two children.

08:05.659 --> 08:06.259
I have a wife.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.541
I have a granddaughter who I love.

08:08.682 --> 08:11.444
And all that's important to me, and family is extremely important to me.

08:11.464 --> 08:12.965
I just lost my mom three months ago.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.068
She was the closest person.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.069
I lost my person three months ago.

08:17.089 --> 08:18.851
She was the closest person to me.

08:18.871 --> 08:19.832
What date did you lose him up?

08:20.392 --> 08:21.053
May 17th.

08:21.513 --> 08:23.695
Yeah, my father was June 16th.

08:23.715 --> 08:24.816
It was pretty cool.

08:25.049 --> 08:28.433
It's been, my mom has always encouraged me, always helped me.

08:28.473 --> 08:30.295
My dad, I lost him in 74.

08:31.016 --> 08:32.277
But I just wouldn't have anything.

08:32.317 --> 08:35.421
And by that I mean, my life would be so empty.

08:35.921 --> 08:42.589
And I would have all these other riches of family, but I wouldn't be staying in this beautiful house if it wasn't for collecting.

08:43.290 --> 08:48.075
I wouldn't feel that I've done something in my life if it wasn't for collecting.

08:48.976 --> 08:53.942
And I would just be much less of a person in riches

08:54.715 --> 08:56.417
other than monetary.

08:56.538 --> 09:03.227
I mean, I feel that what I do is important to somebody besides me.

09:03.568 --> 09:13.202
And which bears that out, just for my Kennedy collection alone, when I'm in Texas, I met 221,000 people that came through in 24 days.

09:13.322 --> 09:14.023
It was a zoo.

09:14.744 --> 09:20.572
But I can't tell you how many people came over to me and were honored to meet me and thanked me for having this exhibit there.

09:20.612 --> 09:22.796
I didn't make any money on the exhibit.

09:22.836 --> 09:23.777
It wasn't about money.

09:24.382 --> 09:28.386
It was about one day became two, became three.

09:28.807 --> 09:29.628
I wanted to come home.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.309
I missed things for my granddaughter.

09:31.349 --> 09:32.050
I called my wife.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.612
I said, look, I've really got to be here.

09:34.112 --> 09:42.321
When I had an exhibit for free at the Franklin Mint, I almost lost my sales job because my boss was going, you're not servicing your account.

09:42.802 --> 09:47.286
And I go, yeah, but I got three buses coming today from the Franklin Mint, and these people expect me to be there.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.849
So what is your day, Joe?

09:50.048 --> 09:51.069
I do this full-time now.

09:51.330 --> 09:52.311
I'm a collector full-time.

09:52.411 --> 09:56.917
My day job up until 1997 was a sales rep for a chemical company.

09:56.957 --> 09:59.120
Which is why you think you can afford to do this full-time?

10:00.682 --> 10:03.786
Well, the museum was my major source of income.

10:03.926 --> 10:06.610
And now that that's gone, I don't know what exactly I'm going to do.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.732
That's why I'm contemplating an auction.

10:09.273 --> 10:15.321
Because if I sold... Actually, I love my collection.

10:16.443 --> 10:17.524
I took it to Florida.

10:17.808 --> 10:18.909
I shared with other people.

10:18.989 --> 10:19.990
I made money off it.

10:20.391 --> 10:23.294
It's like taking your kid to camp and dropping them off.

10:24.616 --> 10:26.498
And then you forget about your kid.

10:27.078 --> 10:32.885
I went in my world here and you see all the stuff I have upstairs, downstairs, downstairs.

10:33.505 --> 10:35.528
And then all of a sudden I get all my Kennedy stuff back.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.931
It's like, I don't remember this kid as well as I did five years ago.

10:39.752 --> 10:42.515
And there's a part of me that wants to keep some of that material.

10:42.555 --> 10:43.396
I won't sell it all.

10:43.997 --> 10:44.878
I'm thinking about

10:45.922 --> 10:55.013
not auctioning off any of the assassination-related material because I have a wonderful, rare, unique, great assassination collection.

10:55.033 --> 11:06.588
Everything from the handle on the Zapruder camera to the flags off the car to Secret Service things in the motorcade to Lee Harvey Oswald's signatures to Jack Ruby's diaries from jail.

11:07.069 --> 11:09.572
Wonderful things.

11:09.592 --> 11:12.175
And I think I'm going to keep all those.

11:12.195 --> 11:15.439
Mrs. Lincoln did entrust a lot of this stuff to you with the

11:16.887 --> 11:19.670
expectation that they would go someplace safe.

11:19.710 --> 11:20.471
No, no.

11:20.691 --> 11:20.972
Is that right?

11:20.992 --> 11:25.156
She entrusted them to me to carry on the legacy of John F. Kennedy.

11:25.176 --> 11:26.097
That's exactly what she said.

11:26.658 --> 11:39.012
I wanted to be carrying on to you because when she was still alive, 87, 88, 89, 90, I had many articles which I could show you in the Boston Globe, New York Times, Baltimore Sun.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.954
But you wrote her that we were in the Bible.

11:41.187 --> 11:42.289
I never mentioned her.

11:42.329 --> 11:43.010
It was private.

11:43.070 --> 11:43.991
That's why she wanted it.

11:44.011 --> 11:47.577
She said, don't tell anybody where you're getting this stuff from because I don't want to be inundated.

11:48.799 --> 11:50.161
So nobody figured it out.

11:50.301 --> 11:55.670
I'd even lie sometimes on where I was getting this stuff from, from an administrative aide or some guy.

11:55.690 --> 11:56.631
I always say guy.

11:56.651 --> 11:57.513
Throw them off.

11:57.893 --> 11:58.634
That was her choice.

11:59.476 --> 12:06.787
I felt funny about it, but ultimately when it came to an interview and I'd sit down with somebody like this and they'd say, well, where do you get this stuff?

12:07.388 --> 12:08.730
I would fend it off with,

12:09.352 --> 12:11.815
I just don't get this stuff handed to me by one person.

12:12.436 --> 12:13.297
I beat the bushes.

12:13.497 --> 12:14.559
I go all over, and that's true.

12:15.179 --> 12:20.306
So the articles that you'll see in 87, 88, 89, it's a mysterious type thing.

12:20.987 --> 12:23.130
And even some... Kind of like a deep throat of collecting.

12:23.270 --> 12:24.812
Right, exactly, exactly.

12:24.952 --> 12:33.162
And once in 95, when she died, I felt this burden of that off me, and then I wanted people... So the story didn't come up until after she died.

12:33.182 --> 12:34.404
Right, right.

12:34.424 --> 12:35.685
I mean, some people figured it out.

12:35.706 --> 12:37.688
Even one guy... What, did the Kennedy family know?

12:38.461 --> 12:42.726
They said they didn't, but they did, because I had huge articles.

12:42.946 --> 12:47.892
I mean, full-page color things in the Washington Times, right under Ted Kennedy's nose.

12:48.313 --> 12:49.735
The Washington Post front page.

12:50.636 --> 12:57.584
After the Jackie sale, the Kennedys realized, aha, this stuff is worth money.

12:58.065 --> 12:59.747
So then they came after me.

12:59.767 --> 13:04.212
But before that... Do you anticipate any further trouble from the Kennedy family?

13:04.232 --> 13:04.452
No.

13:05.013 --> 13:06.935
I have a note right there on the wall.

13:06.955 --> 13:08.417
You can see it from here.

13:08.701 --> 13:13.628
A thank you letter from Caroline Kennedy, thanking me for returning some things to her.

13:13.909 --> 13:15.311
Yeah, but that was then, and this is now.

13:15.411 --> 13:17.714
No, now is now, but... You still got 50,000.

13:17.734 --> 13:20.759
Right, but... And I imagine that some of them are pretty sensitive.

13:21.339 --> 13:30.012
I imagine you've got some... I'm just guessing, but I'm imagining... I'm guessing that you have some stuff here that they might not like people to know about.

13:30.032 --> 13:36.261
Well, it... Maybe I'm wrong on that, but... You're a little right, but Mrs. Lincoln...

13:36.460 --> 13:41.047
And the people that I got things from loved Kennedy, and they didn't keep off-color material.

13:42.149 --> 13:45.193
Do you have stuff that bears on as womanizing, for instance?

13:45.213 --> 13:45.333
Yes.

13:46.555 --> 13:46.776
Yes.

13:46.996 --> 13:48.738
But that didn't come from Mrs. Lincoln.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.162
What I'm saying, the collection— Yes, I do.

13:52.023 --> 13:54.207
The collection is much more—that's what impresses me.

13:54.587 --> 14:01.097
If this was just a pipeline for Mrs. Lincoln, it would be interesting with no great shakes, because you had somebody who liked you and fed you stuff.

14:01.377 --> 14:05.083
But, you know, this is why it's also very important for me to see this stuff.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.508
Yeah, that's when I started here.

14:07.089 --> 14:07.449
You know?

14:07.850 --> 14:11.195
I said, this guy's not a mono guy.

14:11.235 --> 14:13.238
He's got everything here.

14:13.278 --> 14:16.362
This really gives a texture of you to me.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.045
And I love this.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.286
I love this.

14:19.387 --> 14:20.428
I never leave this room.

14:21.750 --> 14:25.676
I love this as much as the Kennedy stuff down here.

14:25.796 --> 14:27.859
Yeah, but anything.

14:27.899 --> 14:29.922
I mean, I'm just, I can tell you about it.

14:29.982 --> 14:31.124
I gravitate towards it.

14:31.724 --> 14:33.467
It all means something to me.

14:34.004 --> 14:39.049
It's not just here as fluff, and it's not just here to impress anybody, because I really don't have that many people in here.

14:39.609 --> 14:48.338
But before, my Kennedy collection now, Dateline, today's show three times, seven million people on any given interview.

14:49.018 --> 14:53.603
So everybody collectively, I mean, I failed public speaking in college.

14:53.643 --> 15:01.210
I mean, I couldn't talk to three people, and this has brought me out of a shell that I was in for many, many years.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.746
I mean, I've taught to advanced history classes at Loyola.

15:05.407 --> 15:15.644
I've done the great American teach-in and was voted the best one of the whole students of kids that were half dope addicts and didn't know where they were even in class.

15:16.045 --> 15:16.906
I had their attention.

15:18.249 --> 15:19.410
And I'm proud of that.

15:19.511 --> 15:26.202
I talked to a faculty of a college, and they had a guy from Oracle tell them about the future of computers, and they're all like,

15:26.722 --> 15:32.134
And I start talking about Kennedy and they're like, and they all come over to me and this Oracle guy's like, why come isn't anybody coming over to me?

15:32.555 --> 15:35.942
It's boring to them, but these people are coming over and going, Mr. White, I can't wait to see the museum.

15:36.002 --> 15:36.463
It's opening.

15:36.523 --> 15:37.987
I mean, can you give me a tour?

15:38.007 --> 15:38.408
I want this.

15:38.869 --> 15:46.806
I donated two tickets and a tour to a charity auction in Tampa and it bought $900 to have a tour of the museum by me.

15:47.056 --> 15:48.277
I felt guilty.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.881
I said, I'm going to bring you back in the vault and show you stuff that's not out.

15:51.101 --> 15:52.222
And the people were like, really?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.724
I mean, Wade Boggs.

15:53.844 --> 15:56.427
Wade Boggs, you know who Wade Boggs is.

15:56.447 --> 15:58.049
Wade Boggs is sitting at a bar.

15:58.630 --> 16:01.013
I go over and I go, Mr. Boggs, hi, nice to meet you.

16:01.033 --> 16:03.336
And I said, because he's Erica Vinoy with his wife.

16:03.957 --> 16:06.580
And he turns to me and he goes, so what brings you to town?

16:06.660 --> 16:08.943
And I went, well, I have the Kennedy Museum that's open.

16:08.963 --> 16:10.244
He goes, the Kennedy Museum?

16:10.284 --> 16:12.407
My daughter's a fanatic about the assassination.

16:12.787 --> 16:13.188
I said, here.

16:13.428 --> 16:14.109
I reached in my pocket.

16:14.129 --> 16:15.411
I gave him two complimentary tickets.

16:15.451 --> 16:15.831
I said,

16:16.503 --> 16:19.288
You and your wife and your daughter, I'll bring you in the back.

16:19.308 --> 16:20.791
She can hold the flags from the car.

16:21.553 --> 16:23.456
He's going, are you kidding me, my wife?

16:23.476 --> 16:24.358
My daughter will go crazy.

16:25.019 --> 16:28.426
Next thing I know, it's right about, like, March.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.291
Next thing I know, the museum, big envelope comes.

16:31.331 --> 16:35.980
I'm invited to the Christmas party of the year, which is Wade Boggs' Christmas party at his house.

16:36.145 --> 17:04.802
valet parking and all this. So my wife and I are hobnobbing with Wade Boggs and all these people. I'm sitting in with American league trophies. Yeah I mean his house is phenomenal, but the point is is just because of Kennedy, I know Wade Boggs. I mean it's bizarre. You're giving of yourself too. It's a trip, I mean, you know the whole thing. I use that term from the 60s. The whole thing is a trip and it just keeps on tripping. So Bob what can I do for you? I mean you have you know this again

17:05.255 --> 17:06.617
It's not my idea, it's Alan's.

17:07.739 --> 17:11.264
And would I love to have a book in my life?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.205
I think so.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.208
In my life of collecting.

17:14.288 --> 17:20.557
And when you say a book, by the way, a book is a, you know, that's a word that encompasses the same thing in the universe.

17:20.617 --> 17:21.378
Right, right, right.

17:21.759 --> 17:22.560
All kinds of books.

17:22.660 --> 17:23.021
Right.

17:24.163 --> 17:29.530
And there are things that I can do, lots of things I can do, but there are some things I can't do.

17:29.671 --> 17:30.131
Right.

17:30.251 --> 17:33.456
And I have to, what I have, I mean, I have to understand that I do this

17:33.757 --> 17:34.478
to make my living.

17:34.498 --> 17:35.118
I understand.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.401
I'm 60 years old.

17:38.702 --> 17:47.070
I am under contract to produce a book, but I would make time to do something, but I would have to be compensated.

17:47.090 --> 17:48.111
I understand.

17:48.651 --> 17:48.951
I understand.

17:48.971 --> 17:56.459
If this is something that you would like to pursue, we could come up with a strategy that might... Well, Alan has some strategies about funding it.

17:57.099 --> 17:57.820
Okay, he did.

17:57.860 --> 17:58.761
That's new to me.

17:58.781 --> 18:00.102
Well, that's what he told me.

18:00.385 --> 18:02.288
And he hasn't discussed that with me.

18:02.328 --> 18:04.851
It was an initial meeting between us, like I did on the phone.

18:04.871 --> 18:05.151
Yeah.

18:05.171 --> 18:09.797
I mean, I have people that have said to me, you should do a book on Kennedy.

18:10.238 --> 18:13.002
And I'm like, no, I don't know if I want to do that.

18:13.062 --> 18:17.928
Personally, if it were me, I would write about it a little bit more than Kennedy.

18:18.088 --> 18:20.552
I mean, this really kind of dazzles me, you know.

18:20.592 --> 18:21.373
Right, right.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.176
But I think... I mean, the passion.

18:24.196 --> 18:26.960
I mean, I coined the phrase, a gentle madness.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.502
I gave him... I love that phrase.

18:28.718 --> 18:31.060
And people say that's exactly what it is.

18:31.080 --> 18:31.841
It is a madness.

18:32.602 --> 18:33.963
Bibliomania.

18:34.163 --> 18:40.369
I stood up in front of the high school kids and I said to myself, the teachers are going to pass out when I say this.

18:40.910 --> 18:47.256
But I went, kids, what I do is my own personal cocaine.

18:47.276 --> 18:48.277
It's my high.

18:48.477 --> 18:52.100
And all these kids, some of them are down like this and they're all like, did you say cocaine?

18:52.140 --> 18:53.962
I mean, you know, they're into it.

18:54.182 --> 18:55.924
So these kids voted me.

18:56.258 --> 18:58.703
the most interesting speaker they've ever had at the school.

18:59.685 --> 19:03.071
And I've got certificates and all this, and I'm like, I just can't believe it.

19:03.091 --> 19:10.826
But this one kid who was like, he was more important to the class members than the teacher.

19:11.147 --> 19:12.429
I think he was like a gang kid.

19:12.990 --> 19:13.812
He got up and goes,

19:14.264 --> 19:17.808
I think we should all thank Mr. White for coming here, because this guy is cool.

19:18.128 --> 19:22.813
And I'm like, kids, you know, because I talk about shrunken heads, and they never know me.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.236
They go, Mr. White, what else do you collect?

19:25.296 --> 19:26.116
You say you're a collector.

19:26.136 --> 19:27.698
What else do you collect besides Kennedy?

19:27.978 --> 19:29.060
Because Kennedy, they don't care.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.842
I said, well, kids, I collect shrunken heads.

19:32.283 --> 19:33.004
They're like, what?

19:33.024 --> 19:34.685
I explained to them about shrunken heads.

19:34.705 --> 19:36.888
They're like, wow, this guy is so far out.

19:36.928 --> 19:37.609
He's out there.

19:37.969 --> 19:38.469
They love me.

19:38.750 --> 19:43.815
So the point is, I think I can connect with a lot of people in the book, but

19:44.470 --> 19:50.159
My Kennedy collection is not me without all my other collections.

19:50.179 --> 19:53.484
It all ties in, not directly, but indirectly.

19:54.926 --> 19:56.508
You know what I'm saying?

19:56.528 --> 19:56.808
Yes.

19:58.151 --> 20:02.116
If I just collected registers, it's boring to some people.

20:02.317 --> 20:08.326
This is the age, by the way, in my last book, which was a book just about collecting.

20:08.366 --> 20:11.170
This is the age we're in now of the material artifacts.

20:11.470 --> 20:15.275
It's not just the book, and it's not just the manuscript, and it's not just the document.

20:15.555 --> 20:19.240
We really want to see the things that give substance to a light.

20:19.781 --> 20:24.367
And I write about Harvard University, which just paid half a million dollars to get some Longfellow stuff.

20:24.467 --> 20:29.053
They already had the Longfellow collection to die for, but why?

20:29.093 --> 20:40.347
They have beer labels of Longfellow beer, broadsides in China, the kinds of things, the material artifact that we give somebody who's coming in to look at this life,

20:40.732 --> 20:43.876
some sense of the person during the lifetime.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.378
This is really what you've put together.

20:45.419 --> 20:50.285
It's a collection of material artifacts as well as documents and things.

20:50.305 --> 20:57.555
You're seeing, you know, I'd say 70% of it, because there's still a lot tucked away.

20:58.336 --> 20:58.957
Yeah.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.262
You saw the Kennedy collection, but I still have more.

21:02.422 --> 21:03.984
Oh, I'm sure, yeah.

21:04.004 --> 21:04.325
Yeah.

21:04.405 --> 21:06.688
So, I mean, I'd be happy to

21:06.989 --> 21:09.112
discuss doing something, and I'd make time to do it.

21:09.213 --> 21:11.877
But Alan is integral, because it was his idea.

21:12.217 --> 21:13.219
I mean, I didn't come to you.

21:13.499 --> 21:28.884
He recommended you, he said, and then he wants to interwork a book on my collection, really pounding away on the Kennedy aspect, which is really important, because I've got a lot of great stories on Kennedy and all the stuff that's happened to me over the years.

21:28.964 --> 21:34.313
Believe me, I've got people who just want me to do a book about the controversy that I was involved in, which was really

21:34.580 --> 21:35.662
a false controversy.

21:35.682 --> 21:36.603
It was all implied.

21:36.623 --> 21:37.745
But you gave stuff.

21:37.825 --> 21:40.810
I gave $1.2 million worth of stuff.

21:40.830 --> 21:47.480
I gave the Kennedy stuff that they knew I had that wasn't even remotely thought of as being auctioned.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.383
Caroline just said, well, I want that wallet.

21:49.403 --> 21:50.404
And I go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

21:50.424 --> 21:51.566
I was never going to sell his wallet.

21:52.247 --> 21:53.389
She goes, well, you got two wallets.

21:53.429 --> 21:53.990
I want one of them.

21:54.491 --> 21:56.213
And I'm like, well, nobody understands that.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.056
His diaries.

21:58.660 --> 22:03.246
I had the Kennedy Library historian say it's the fine of the century on Kennedy.

22:03.286 --> 22:06.049
Kennedy's diaries from his fact-finding tour in 51.

22:06.990 --> 22:07.651
Mrs. Lincoln had them.

22:08.232 --> 22:10.034
He used them in speeches for years after.

22:10.074 --> 22:12.216
They were old news.

22:12.817 --> 22:14.319
In 53, they were used up.

22:14.639 --> 22:15.360
In 51, he did them.

22:15.420 --> 22:16.682
Two years later, they were old news.

22:16.702 --> 22:17.263
She saved them.

22:19.385 --> 22:19.826
I had them.

22:20.006 --> 22:20.987
She wrote them to me.

22:21.007 --> 22:21.828
I look at them.

22:21.848 --> 22:23.630
I translated them, for God's sake.

22:23.650 --> 22:24.972
It took me three months to translate them.

22:24.992 --> 22:25.933
Nobody can translate them.

22:26.437 --> 22:27.258
I translate them.

22:27.338 --> 22:28.980
I wouldn't give them, but I gave them to them.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.542
I wouldn't give them three months of my work.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.645
I said, you can find somebody to translate them.

22:32.665 --> 22:33.746
I'm not giving them a translation.

22:34.347 --> 22:34.968
They're incredible.

22:34.988 --> 22:41.276
These conversations with Tito and his comments all about the situations in Asia.

22:41.516 --> 22:42.437
So they asked for them?

22:43.198 --> 22:44.019
They asked for them.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.421
Would you say they demanded them?

22:45.982 --> 22:46.743
Yeah.

22:47.043 --> 22:50.868
But in 96, they saw them.

22:50.888 --> 22:51.629
The guy had them in his hand.

22:51.649 --> 22:53.612
He goes, Robert, this is the find of the century.

22:53.752 --> 22:55.414
I go, yeah, I'd like to do something with them.

22:55.681 --> 22:59.925
So I thought, okay, to fund a museum, I'll do it on my own.

23:00.626 --> 23:02.848
It was a pipe dream back in 96.

23:03.048 --> 23:08.474
So 97, I offered them to the Kennedy Library for sale at what I thought was a very reasonable price.

23:08.574 --> 23:10.896
Enough money to open my own museum.

23:12.178 --> 23:13.539
And they went nuts.

23:14.580 --> 23:15.241
They just went nuts.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.563
They went, how dare you offer something like that?

23:17.583 --> 23:20.606
I'm like, other people offer you stuff all the time.

23:20.626 --> 23:22.208
They find angels to buy stuff, you know?

23:22.848 --> 23:24.530
So anyway, that's what set it off.

23:24.550 --> 23:25.671
They had this

23:25.938 --> 23:28.902
in their crawl that I offered it to them.

23:29.462 --> 23:37.072
Plus, I was giving them, giving them a love letter that Mrs. Lincoln gave me.

23:37.393 --> 23:44.502
It was a five-page love letter from Jackie Kennedy to John Kennedy.

23:44.522 --> 23:45.363
Love and Mary?

23:45.383 --> 23:45.623
Yes.

23:45.823 --> 23:46.344
Oh, yeah.

23:46.364 --> 23:47.586
It showed their ultimate.

23:47.686 --> 23:48.347
It showed Jackie.

23:48.367 --> 23:49.628
I mean, she was pouring out.

23:50.149 --> 23:52.992
Never showed it to anybody because I thought it was too personal.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.975
And I said, you know, this is too personal.

23:54.995 --> 23:55.776
This is slimy.

23:56.144 --> 24:08.576
Mrs. Lincoln gave it to me because she said, if there's ever a doubt, she said to me, I'm giving you this because if there's ever a doubt in your mind that they didn't love each other, this will prove it, that they loved each other.

24:09.016 --> 24:09.857
What year was it written?

24:09.877 --> 24:20.487
It was written on Onassis' yacht when she was touring the Mediterranean with her and Lee in October of 1963, one month before.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.729
So it's a beautiful letter.

24:23.410 --> 24:25.392
So Caroline found out that I had it.

24:25.642 --> 24:27.043
Ted Kennedy found out that I had it.

24:27.384 --> 24:29.565
And I said, I'm offering it to you with the diaries.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.246
Just take it off.

24:31.047 --> 24:34.470
I think it was $850,000, something like that.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.213
I mean, the diaries are worth millions.

24:39.294 --> 24:43.578
And they just got a jag on it for me after that.

24:43.838 --> 24:44.218
I knew.

24:44.438 --> 24:46.260
I mean, I have all the freedom of information.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.383
I have enough freedom.

24:49.543 --> 24:55.328
It cost me thousands in freedom of information documents that I have that prove everything that I can say.

24:55.578 --> 25:01.784
I mean, Greg Craig, who was Clinton's attorney, and Eileen Gonzalez and all that stuff.

25:02.524 --> 25:05.007
Greg Craig and Ted Kennedy sitting around talking about me.

25:05.387 --> 25:07.669
Ted Kennedy says, let's see what makes this guy tick.

25:08.030 --> 25:10.272
I mean, I have the notes from the Kennedy Library on it.

25:10.292 --> 25:11.453
The Kennedys play hardball.

25:11.473 --> 25:12.674
Yes, they were playing hardball.

25:12.814 --> 25:15.096
I mean, Joe McGinnis is a good friend of mine, by the way.

25:15.116 --> 25:17.518
I know what Joe's been, you know, I know what these people could be.

25:17.538 --> 25:19.820
I told you, I think on the phone, I was Operation Bob White.

25:20.321 --> 25:21.102
That's what they called me.

25:22.163 --> 25:24.825
It was a subversive effort to...

25:25.261 --> 25:27.584
do everything to get me.

25:27.604 --> 25:29.287
And these guys play with baseball bats.

25:29.367 --> 25:30.588
I mean, figuratively.

25:30.609 --> 25:32.211
And all I am is a little collector.

25:32.591 --> 25:40.583
Well, I'm a collector trying... Don't think for one second that you're a little... Well, compared to the big guys.

25:41.023 --> 25:42.706
No, no, you have the collection.

25:42.866 --> 25:44.248
And you have Mrs. Lincoln's stuff.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.511
They resented that.

25:46.531 --> 25:50.697
They know she was with them for... They don't know why Mrs. Lincoln gave me the stuff.

25:50.797 --> 25:51.298
Doesn't matter.

25:51.318 --> 25:52.139
Well, I know why.

25:52.820 --> 25:53.340
I know why.

25:53.501 --> 25:55.183
Because...

25:56.024 --> 25:58.127
They forgot about her.

25:58.147 --> 26:01.491
They probably didn't realize that she went out with all this stuff, either.

26:01.511 --> 26:04.234
No, they knew, but they forgot about her.

26:04.634 --> 26:07.138
And they didn't care about the stuff until after the Jackie sale.

26:07.158 --> 26:08.239
But here's the thing.

26:08.279 --> 26:12.384
Mrs. Lincoln sat there, and it was Caroline's wedding.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.607
I went over about three weeks before Caroline's wedding.

26:14.727 --> 26:17.210
We used to talk before she'd give me things, and we'd talk for hours.

26:17.851 --> 26:22.676
And I said to her, just like I'm talking to you, I said, Mrs. Lincoln, so obviously, where's Caroline getting married?

26:22.696 --> 26:23.598
I mean, you're going, right?

26:24.439 --> 26:24.799
This...

26:25.471 --> 26:26.693
Remorse came over.

26:27.173 --> 26:30.297
And she went, no, I'm not going.

26:30.317 --> 26:30.918
And stopped it.

26:31.419 --> 26:33.481
And I saw, don't go there.

26:34.382 --> 26:35.143
So I just went.

26:35.163 --> 26:38.007
It was like when we talk about the assassination, she started to well up.

26:38.087 --> 26:38.668
But a mistake.

26:38.948 --> 26:39.128
Yeah.

26:39.309 --> 26:40.530
But they forgot about her, see?

26:40.810 --> 26:41.571
And that hurt her.

26:41.631 --> 26:43.234
That might have been the fatal.

26:43.454 --> 26:43.894
That hurt her.

26:43.994 --> 26:45.356
That might have cost them the stuff.

26:45.697 --> 26:46.357
Exactly right.

26:46.818 --> 26:47.579
And nobody knows that.

26:47.799 --> 26:54.668
And let me tell you, when I put her urn at Arlington in the columbarium, two Kennedys were there.

26:55.576 --> 26:56.617
Ted didn't even show up.

26:56.697 --> 27:05.408
And this was the woman who I said to Mr. Metzler, I said, when we leave this administration building in Arlington, we're going to make a left and go down to the Columbarium.

27:05.448 --> 27:10.874
Can we one time just go to the right and go one pass by Kennedy's grave in her honor?

27:11.195 --> 27:12.496
He goes, great idea, Robert.

27:12.516 --> 27:12.977
Let's do that.

27:13.517 --> 27:19.204
Because Mrs. Lincoln, from 64 until the year she died in 95, never missed

27:19.690 --> 27:21.972
November 22nd, going to the grave.

27:22.153 --> 27:23.154
And I have tons of pictures.

27:23.194 --> 27:26.497
It was every, in the paper, the loyal secretary going to see her boss.

27:27.118 --> 27:30.061
It made every Boston Globe paper every year, all those years.

27:30.522 --> 27:32.684
And one last time to pass it.

27:32.704 --> 27:34.686
And Mr. Lincoln was, he was in tears.

27:34.706 --> 27:36.468
But I brought Mr. Lincoln back to the apartment.

27:36.548 --> 27:40.452
I'm arriving and I go, my wife's in the back seat and I'm going, Mr. Lincoln, I got to ask you this.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.174
Why me?

27:42.194 --> 27:45.398
Why did your wife give me that stuff all these years?

27:45.418 --> 27:48.381
He turned to me and he went, Robert, she loved you.

27:48.665 --> 27:49.727
And she respected you.

27:49.867 --> 27:53.552
And to my wife, those two qualities are the utmost in a person.

27:53.592 --> 27:54.654
How old was she when she died?

27:54.674 --> 27:55.835
She was 85.

27:56.236 --> 27:57.438
And she had no children of her own?

27:57.458 --> 27:58.099
No children.

27:58.119 --> 28:03.747
Do you think maybe there was a... I say that, but I hate that when people go, oh, I'm like a son she never had.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.953
I don't like that, but I really... But you can't dismiss it.

28:07.973 --> 28:10.116
I think I was a friend.

28:10.754 --> 28:11.896
that she counted on.

28:11.916 --> 28:14.160
I went over and set up her answering machine.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.063
Yeah, but you met her when you were 13.

28:16.203 --> 28:19.428
Yes, but I went over and set up her answering machine because they couldn't figure out.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.570
She knew you from the time you were a kid.

28:21.271 --> 28:25.258
I said to her, if you ever need anything, call me up.

28:25.659 --> 28:28.042
And she would call me up and say, Robert, next time can you come over?

28:28.083 --> 28:29.845
Can you put my tapes in this damn machine?

28:29.865 --> 28:31.228
I can't figure it out.

28:31.248 --> 28:31.769
So how far did you live?

28:31.809 --> 28:32.430
She lived in Bethesda.

28:32.450 --> 28:33.251
So it was close.

28:33.271 --> 28:36.897
Yeah, 30 minutes away.

28:37.282 --> 28:41.227
But anyway, I could go on and on and on, but I've got tons of stories.

28:41.247 --> 28:45.392
You know, obviously, if we... Well... It has to be a number.

28:45.412 --> 28:47.174
I may have to come back and spend some time with you.

28:47.254 --> 28:48.315
Oh, yeah.

28:48.335 --> 28:48.676
I know that.

28:48.756 --> 28:49.717
I know that.

28:49.977 --> 28:51.099
And I'm pretty skilled.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.423
You think I'm not interviewing you now?

28:54.443 --> 28:55.324
No, I'm sure you are.

28:55.344 --> 28:56.245
No, I have no doubt.

28:56.666 --> 28:58.308
And I have the utmost respect for what you do.

28:58.408 --> 29:00.711
Alan gave me copies of your books.

29:00.831 --> 29:02.993
I mean, I've never had a problem.

29:03.153 --> 29:06.057
You know, my stuff is...

29:06.374 --> 29:09.479
I've been sharing my first book with a finalist for the National Book Critics.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.082
I write for the Circle Award.

29:11.723 --> 29:12.344
The New York Times.

29:12.784 --> 29:13.766
Extremely well.

29:13.786 --> 29:20.717
My brand new book coming out has had two rave reviews, Publishers Weekly and Kirkus just last week.

29:21.338 --> 29:21.859
That's great.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.642
What are you in town for now?

29:23.682 --> 29:25.726
I'm giving a lecture tomorrow night.

29:26.006 --> 29:28.150
Ralph Nader personally invited me to give a talk.

29:28.210 --> 29:28.450
Great.

29:28.632 --> 29:29.593
to save D.C.

29:29.633 --> 29:30.094
libraries.

29:30.114 --> 29:33.238
He read my book, Patience and Supportive, which is about libraries.

29:33.258 --> 29:33.898
Yeah, I have it.

29:33.918 --> 29:34.519
That's right in there.

29:34.539 --> 29:41.928
So, I mean, I have book culture and everything that it represents, but I write about archaeology in the new book.

29:41.948 --> 29:46.974
I write about all kinds of writing surfaces through history, the destruction of libraries.

29:46.994 --> 29:51.940
My new book is called The Splendor, but it isn't certainly going to copy out when it comes out.

29:52.274 --> 29:56.458
But, you know, we have to figure out how can I help you.

29:56.618 --> 30:01.163
And he wants it to work in conjunction with the auction, and that's what I don't understand.

30:01.323 --> 30:05.347
Okay, well, you know, again, I'm a professional writer.

30:05.367 --> 30:09.512
But I'm not an auction person, and Alan is, and I defer to him with that.

30:09.572 --> 30:13.636
So just make sure he knows that when we leave, because, you know.

30:13.656 --> 30:17.299
Well, he talked to me in business terms.

30:17.360 --> 30:17.860
Okay.

30:18.380 --> 30:22.165
on how we can get somebody to fund this, and I'm like, he lost me.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.586
I do what I do.

30:23.646 --> 30:26.189
I don't pretend to know a lot about other subjects.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.811
But, I mean, I have to be ready.

30:28.532 --> 30:29.333
It's your livelihood.

30:29.373 --> 30:30.094
I understand that.

30:30.174 --> 30:34.059
I mean, I got a Jaguar my father gave me.

30:34.559 --> 30:35.160
He's a V12.

30:35.661 --> 30:36.301
I understand.

30:36.341 --> 30:38.124
That's fix or repair daily.

30:38.244 --> 30:41.227
He brought it new, you know, and he's the original one and he gave it to me.

30:41.247 --> 30:41.748
That's great.

30:42.108 --> 30:45.973
And he just died, and the mechanic is costing me 50 bucks.

30:46.139 --> 30:47.661
I mean, this was an hour.

30:47.681 --> 30:48.923
That's what mechanics meant.

30:49.183 --> 30:52.588
You know, long is... These gags are beautiful, but boy, I tell you, you know.

30:52.608 --> 30:53.970
Yeah, I can't wait.

30:54.070 --> 30:55.512
I can't wait to get it.

30:55.572 --> 31:02.081
Yeah, but what I'm trying to say is the guy that comes to make a service call for them to think, I mean... I got you.

31:02.321 --> 31:03.563
I got two Mercedes out there.

31:03.923 --> 31:04.684
I know what you're saying.

31:05.786 --> 31:07.308
How do I put a value on what I do?

31:07.328 --> 31:08.029
It's the time.

31:08.129 --> 31:09.131
It's time.

31:09.471 --> 31:10.172
You're like a lawyer.

31:10.591 --> 31:14.858
Yeah, I'd like to think that there are a lot of lawyers in the country.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.561
There aren't many people that do what I do.

31:18.304 --> 31:22.992
And I think enjoy the respect that I have.

31:23.012 --> 31:25.577
I should send you the new review of Publishers Weekly last week.

31:25.617 --> 31:34.692
I mean, they say the acclaimed, you know, they call my trilogy of books acclaimed, and my legions of fans will be thrilled.

31:35.043 --> 31:36.686
Oh, excellent.

31:36.706 --> 31:37.647
My numbers on there.

31:37.707 --> 31:38.929
Terrific, yeah.

31:38.949 --> 31:40.492
So let's talk to Alan.

31:40.612 --> 31:41.173
All right.

31:41.614 --> 31:43.597
Let me take a couple of pictures of you if you don't mind.

31:43.617 --> 31:44.258
Sure, sure, sure.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.681
Anything you want?

31:45.781 --> 31:55.177
And then maybe I may have a couple of strategies that, you know, if I could get a couple of freelance things going.

31:55.277 --> 31:58.502
Well, that would make it, that would be good for me, Alan.

31:59.815 --> 32:01.858
This photograph is very well on you, by the way.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.201
This is my new Contacts 3.

32:04.321 --> 32:07.606
I had a Contacts 2 which you swallowed.

32:07.626 --> 32:12.613
I was in Italy and London.

32:12.633 --> 32:14.135
Yeah, I'm an advocate about it myself.

32:14.416 --> 32:16.519
I have a huge security system here.

32:16.539 --> 32:17.540
Oh, how about over here?

32:17.640 --> 32:19.143
Go stand over by it.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.772
Good stuff, good stuff.

32:28.503 --> 32:43.339
It is photographed very well in general.

33:05.138 --> 33:08.262
So, Nick, I want to show you this real quick.

33:08.282 --> 33:11.225
This is an overview.

33:11.245 --> 33:16.131
This is, I have tons of articles.

33:16.171 --> 33:21.918
These are some of the things in my collection that I professionally wrote.

33:22.219 --> 33:24.902
But this was History of Hollywood.

33:24.922 --> 33:26.744
This is 1987.

33:26.764 --> 33:30.429
And Mrs. Lincoln, she would critique these articles I talk about.

33:30.489 --> 33:32.752
The Collective Powers of J.K.

33:32.932 --> 33:34.774
It says in here, you know,

33:34.957 --> 33:37.180
unknown source and all this kind of stuff.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.847
And then all these other things.

33:41.867 --> 33:42.068
Wisconsin.

33:42.108 --> 33:44.491
This is the half a page I have in the New York Times.

33:44.912 --> 33:46.975
Are you collecting that?

33:47.395 --> 33:49.058
A lot, yeah.

33:49.078 --> 33:50.260
Do you have any copies of these around?

33:50.800 --> 33:52.403
Oh, I have hundreds.

33:52.423 --> 33:52.783
All right, stop.

33:52.803 --> 33:54.346
Maybe you can.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.227
Yeah, I can give you some copies.

34:04.201 --> 34:05.944
Would you like to take some of these?

34:05.964 --> 34:08.367
Yes, sir, if you don't mind.

34:08.387 --> 34:08.868
No, I don't know.

34:08.888 --> 34:10.751
Here's one in the Boston Globe.

34:10.771 --> 34:19.725
What's the year on the globe, right?

34:20.185 --> 34:21.587
You have to tell me.

34:21.607 --> 34:22.970
I remember that.

34:22.990 --> 34:24.051
That's 1996, yes.

34:24.071 --> 34:24.993
See, I can get all this.

34:25.013 --> 34:26.495
What's this next?

34:26.515 --> 34:29.620
Yeah, well, anyway, you can take these on the bottom of it.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.145
This is a color playoff that I have on my mom's face.

34:33.344 --> 34:40.822
And then I can do a LexisNexis for you.

34:40.842 --> 34:43.789
You know what LexisNexis is.

34:43.810 --> 34:46.476
All right, I've got one.
