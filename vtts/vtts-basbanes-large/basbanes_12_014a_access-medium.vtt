WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:07.362
We are going to have a good time.

00:08.423 --> 00:13.388
George Higgins, Sergeant.

00:13.488 --> 00:18.132
I don't mind at all.

00:18.192 --> 00:22.156
How do I follow Obama's law?

00:23.077 --> 00:25.940
I've never had that apprehension before.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.381
You didn't know that with Eddie Doyle?

00:27.962 --> 00:30.544
I had figures being written before Eddie Doyle was published.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.492
I had Kogan written before Digger was published.

00:33.512 --> 00:37.777
I've always had the next book written before that one was published.

00:37.797 --> 00:46.126
But Balmer, I finished just before it went into production because of the, as I said, as I tell you, I don't love my team.

00:46.366 --> 00:50.030
And then my computer blew up, my previous Apple.

00:50.050 --> 00:56.076
And I had to go to a Mac, and then I had to go to Microsoft, and it took me the agonies of the damned.

00:56.377 --> 00:58.219
to learn that program.

00:58.239 --> 01:00.001
I use the word purple today.

01:00.021 --> 01:02.424
Now, I use Microsoft and I've learned it now.

01:02.884 --> 01:08.211
So I've learned, I probably use 8% of the capacities of that program in that computer.

01:08.311 --> 01:10.053
But that happens to be the 8% I need.

01:11.134 --> 01:13.016
It makes the black match on the white paper.

01:13.036 --> 01:13.657
That's all I want.

01:13.897 --> 01:16.981
I don't want to do spreadsheets, graphics, anything like that.

01:17.181 --> 01:19.484
I want to make the black match on the white paper.

01:19.684 --> 01:20.805
And it does that.

01:20.965 --> 01:25.911
But the consequence of it was, and I didn't finish Barmer until last fall,

01:26.768 --> 01:29.131
And it was time to put it right into production then.

01:29.152 --> 01:31.615
I mean, you had to go for a copy of it.

01:31.675 --> 01:36.843
So it didn't really get into production until... Well, we caught up to it.

01:36.923 --> 01:41.189
So if it got into production, I'd say, sometimes, right up out of the spring.

01:41.550 --> 01:42.852
And that was about right.

01:42.892 --> 01:45.756
We had hard work since October.

01:46.377 --> 01:54.668
But the result was that I didn't get the next book written before Varma came out.

01:54.768 --> 01:56.430
When did you start working on Varma?

01:56.510 --> 01:58.753
I mean, is this the natural progression of Varma?

01:58.773 --> 02:05.021
When I got into the... There was another thing I did while I was having the problems with my teeth.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.946
I got something pretty close to septicemia with my teeth.

02:08.966 --> 02:13.552
The periodontal disease that I had the surgery to prevent happened anyway.

02:13.672 --> 02:15.034
And I ended up having five teeth.

02:15.959 --> 02:24.828
And I was really sick of that.

02:25.429 --> 02:29.433
And at the same time, filled with abject fear.

02:29.453 --> 02:33.017
That was the real motivation.

02:33.037 --> 02:34.419
Not the Nicoderm patch, which I also used.

02:34.439 --> 02:35.119
I decided I'd try to stop smoking.

02:35.140 --> 02:39.825
Because nobody can smoke the way I was smoking without doing damage.

02:39.845 --> 02:44.970
I was waking up in the middle of the night and blowing chloroceptic down my throat, badly to kill the pain and badly to kill the smell of burned flesh.

02:45.254 --> 02:52.844
I was smoking two and a half days a day, every day, rain and shine, including holy days of obligation.

02:52.864 --> 02:54.046
And I just, I knew it.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.488
I had to stop doing this.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.011
And when did you quit smoking?

02:58.051 --> 02:59.093
I didn't quit.

02:59.113 --> 02:59.433
I'll never quit.

02:59.453 --> 02:59.814
I'm a junkie.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.899
I haven't had one for quite a long time, a year and a half.

03:03.919 --> 03:10.808
And I must confess, after what I went through with withdrawal, I saw, I had a witness when I was a federal prosecutor.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.033
He was a heroin junkie.

03:14.053 --> 03:14.974
We turned him.

03:16.203 --> 03:18.006
And we had him on methadone.

03:19.149 --> 03:20.431
Methadone maintenance.

03:20.471 --> 03:22.335
But I guess we didn't maintain him well enough.

03:22.355 --> 03:23.437
He went out of withdrawal.

03:23.457 --> 03:25.200
And I saw him.

03:25.220 --> 03:28.467
He had the shakes and the chills and the fever and the sweat.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.310
And it was agony.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.254
Well, he was in it for five or six days.

03:32.673 --> 03:34.455
I was only in it for one.

03:34.475 --> 03:43.067
But when I used up my reservoir of nicotine from the soft tissue, the biggest pack was giving me 21 milligrams.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.230
I was used to 60 a day.

03:46.271 --> 03:55.744
When I used up my reservoir, my reserve, the level, say, I began to get hemp packs.

03:55.724 --> 03:59.370
No, the tenth day that was.

03:59.430 --> 04:05.920
The eleventh day I was disconsolate for no reason at all because I had nothing to be controlled about.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.845
And the third day I had to go to bed.

04:08.865 --> 04:15.536
And I said, I tried to quit many times, stopped any time before.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.801
Each time I had gone into the initial stages of physiological withdrawal.

04:18.861 --> 04:22.727
And each time I said, I can't do this, I got work to do.

04:23.264 --> 04:27.130
And that was the excuse to resume smoking.

04:27.150 --> 04:28.092
Do you crave it still?

04:28.112 --> 04:28.473
No.

04:29.174 --> 04:36.025
And I think the paradox is, I think it's because in her, the agony of withdrawal is just so awful.

04:36.225 --> 04:37.728
And there's something else they don't tell you.

04:37.868 --> 04:43.197
It says on the patch, by the way, the direction may help to alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal.

04:43.582 --> 04:46.409
There's an obvious corollary implied there, isn't there?

04:46.429 --> 04:47.392
It may not, too.

04:47.592 --> 04:51.783
All right, we're back on again.

04:51.803 --> 04:54.069
Tell me about the concept of normal law.

04:54.089 --> 04:54.611
There was many.

04:54.851 --> 04:55.413
There never is.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.363
When I got through...

04:59.849 --> 05:03.854
with the teeth and the hot smoke.

05:04.755 --> 05:10.681
Then I started working on the novel I'd been working on, and that's when the computer went down.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.004
And furthermore, the second computer went down.

05:13.024 --> 05:14.385
Now, actually, I'd say that.

05:14.405 --> 05:18.590
It was really the program that just cracked, and you can't buy that disc anymore.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.152
It doesn't exist.

05:20.172 --> 05:24.217
TFS Wright, or Apple II C. I know, and I have it.

05:24.277 --> 05:26.519
Well, it doesn't exist anymore.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.240
You can't replace it.

05:28.165 --> 05:31.628
But look, the whole novel is on that program.

05:31.648 --> 05:33.170
You give them your dits?

05:33.310 --> 05:35.812
No, of course I don't give them my dits.

05:35.952 --> 05:37.294
I give them manuscripts.

05:37.314 --> 05:37.734
I'm talking.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.936
I'm 54 years old, for tripe's sakes.

05:39.956 --> 05:41.337
I'm not giving dits to anybody.

05:41.357 --> 05:42.078
I give them manuscripts.

05:42.799 --> 05:44.420
I write books.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.184
Except that if you make changes, it really will eliminate typos.

05:48.844 --> 05:50.186
You'll never eliminate typos.

05:50.206 --> 05:56.051
It's always going to be a human enterprise, and it will always be imperfect.

05:56.632 --> 05:57.092
No, no just paper.

05:57.781 --> 06:00.226
So I can't... It's principle, I get it.

06:00.267 --> 06:00.828
Yes, it is.

06:00.888 --> 06:03.935
I'm more comfortable with it, and we're going to do it by way.

06:03.955 --> 06:06.480
I'm the guy... You can't start without me in the Senate.

06:06.641 --> 06:11.872
If you want to publish my book, I am essential.

06:11.973 --> 06:12.634
Well, anyway...

06:13.137 --> 06:23.373
I had to go through this agony that I told you about, learning a new machine and a new program, and it was agony.

06:23.393 --> 06:24.915
See, I don't know how to type.

06:24.935 --> 06:30.463
I never get computer screen headaches because I don't look at the screen.

06:30.604 --> 06:32.326
I have to look at the keyboard still.

06:32.366 --> 06:34.550
These glasses were never necessary for me.

06:34.630 --> 06:37.554
I do 90 words in a minute.

06:37.915 --> 06:39.617
And it's by looking at?

06:40.158 --> 06:40.619
Yeah.

06:40.659 --> 06:42.081
I'm a newspaper man.

06:42.061 --> 06:47.291
I mean, I do 90 words a minute, but as well, this is how I do it.

06:47.331 --> 06:52.420
But I drive my children nuts.

06:52.440 --> 07:00.795
And I don't make that many cycles, although I make more of the computer because he's just really going to get a... Anyway, I finally learned the...

07:01.349 --> 07:08.554
Now I've got to find somebody who can convert the PFS right to Microsoft so that I can continue the way.

07:08.574 --> 07:10.099
Well, I'm sure you can do it.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.507
Well, I didn't find anybody who could.

07:13.212 --> 07:18.477
And my son's a computer genius.

07:18.497 --> 07:25.605
So I go back and start reading a novel over again because I'm going to have to put it on a loop with myself or I'll hire somebody to do it.

07:25.665 --> 07:27.287
I did it.

07:27.307 --> 07:27.887
I didn't like it.

07:29.609 --> 07:32.632
No, I didn't want it from it.

07:32.652 --> 07:37.377
So I put it in a box and saved it with all the other false stars I've made.

07:37.437 --> 07:39.219
I had about 140 pages.

07:39.239 --> 07:40.300
Yeah, I've got several of them.

07:41.225 --> 07:42.447
I don't always get it right.

07:42.467 --> 07:46.716
All this bunk about being an established writer, yeah, but that doesn't mean you're always on the money.

07:47.457 --> 07:48.700
Who was it that told me?

07:49.180 --> 07:50.784
James Lee Burton.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.926
Yeah.

07:51.946 --> 07:53.769
I love it when they called me an overnight success.

07:54.270 --> 07:57.517
Yeah, it took me 70 years to become an overnight.

07:57.537 --> 07:58.458
I said that not right.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.661
Is that right?

08:00.442 --> 08:03.368
I said, when Eddie Cole came out, I was...

08:03.820 --> 08:24.090
Well, anyway, now I've got

08:24.374 --> 08:32.944
the new computer and I can use it because I don't have a button to finish on it.

08:33.024 --> 08:36.869
And I didn't know what I was going to do, so I went sailing.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.190
I got a boat again after eight years of being boatless.

08:38.210 --> 08:41.875
Bootless I've been called many times because I was also boatless.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.278
And it didn't bother me at all.

08:44.298 --> 08:50.245
Except when I passed water or a sailboat out on the water or a sailboat there.

08:50.325 --> 08:51.286
Things like that.

08:51.306 --> 08:52.567
But otherwise it didn't bother me.

08:52.587 --> 08:53.048
Then I ate my guts out.

08:53.213 --> 09:08.447
But otherwise you didn't want to.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.612
And when I got back in, whenever I got back, I started in probably September of 92.

09:10.632 --> 09:11.254
On the rooftops of the Blazers.

09:11.274 --> 09:11.374
Yeah.

09:11.843 --> 09:17.934
I tried to figure out what happened after the season, so you actually began with a scene and two characters.

09:17.954 --> 09:19.036
That was it.

09:19.056 --> 09:20.278
But I had no idea what was going on.

09:20.298 --> 09:24.625
When I sat in that first chapter, I didn't know they were waiting for an idiot.

09:24.645 --> 09:28.953
It was like, yeah, I'm waiting for Bomber's Law to show up in the first chapter.

09:28.973 --> 09:29.714
Oh, I never know what the title is.

09:29.734 --> 09:32.860
I didn't know the title, but the idea of where we were going was, you know.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.122
I didn't know.

09:34.102 --> 09:38.327
That's why I write so fast, to find out how it comes out.

09:38.347 --> 09:43.152
My friend, Bill Rosenberg, who's a professor at the University of Chicago, he does that radio show, The American Leader.

09:44.434 --> 09:49.339
Boston's the only market that doesn't have an outlet.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.163
His description of it is that my book happened to me.

09:53.183 --> 09:54.185
And that's not that.

09:54.205 --> 09:56.447
That's pretty good.

09:56.928 --> 09:57.809
I think he's right.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.170
That's definitely the conversation.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.852
Well, do you find...

10:01.338 --> 10:15.120
I mean, because you are a writer, but you do, as you say, you whack out that in the woods a minute.

10:15.140 --> 10:15.500
Yeah, I do.

10:15.520 --> 10:19.347
And it's white, but it's not a first draft kind of a novel.

10:19.367 --> 10:19.627
Well, it was.

10:19.647 --> 10:20.068
It was a first draft.

10:20.088 --> 10:20.308
No kidding.

10:20.761 --> 10:26.169
After the request of Ash Green, the editor, I cut 175 words.

10:26.509 --> 10:29.694
That's the only 175 words.

10:30.095 --> 10:30.515
175.

10:30.535 --> 10:33.459
It was toward the end of the book.

10:33.479 --> 10:36.684
He said it was extraneous and did nothing to the story.

10:36.824 --> 10:39.208
He told me I could cut it, so I could.

10:39.228 --> 10:41.371
No, I think he was right.

10:41.591 --> 10:43.694
I didn't fight it.

10:43.714 --> 10:48.661
I knew I had a right to it when I was a rookie.

10:49.302 --> 10:50.464
Defending Billy Ryan.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.454
which was written on the old machine.

10:54.474 --> 10:55.115
It was a seventh draft.

10:55.276 --> 11:00.184
I didn't know until the fifth draft how Jerry really won the game.

11:00.805 --> 11:02.929
I thought he really did do it on skills.

11:03.109 --> 11:06.355
He said, just as he thought.

11:06.375 --> 11:13.026
And it wasn't until he used the weight in the fifth draft that it could be Cadillac Teddy, because it was fixed.

11:13.782 --> 11:17.005
But Jerry didn't know it.

11:17.025 --> 11:19.468
Then I did another draft, very fast.

11:19.768 --> 11:27.776
The draft, I mean, I started the first word on the first page, and I go to the last period on the last page.

11:27.796 --> 11:28.877
It goes through it.

11:30.179 --> 11:32.201
Then you go back and try new things.

11:32.221 --> 11:35.944
I guess what I'm driving at is, because we did talk about it.

11:36.085 --> 11:37.766
I'm talking about the word processor.

11:37.786 --> 11:38.988
I mean, I've changed my M.O.

11:39.008 --> 11:40.889
The lure of the word processor is that it starts to feel subjective.

11:40.910 --> 11:41.410
It does allow you...

11:41.626 --> 11:47.755
I did it on a typewriter.

11:48.596 --> 11:57.008
I did four drafts, and that was a 700-page manuscript.

11:57.028 --> 12:01.854
And it was a press draft every time.

12:01.874 --> 12:02.976
I cannot bear to turn in

12:03.293 --> 12:05.697
Foul copies.

12:05.717 --> 12:07.900
I turn in fair copies.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.042
That's it.

12:09.062 --> 12:09.823
I'm a professional.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.545
And it's going in that way.

12:11.565 --> 12:17.013
More than three titles on any page, the page gets redone.

12:17.254 --> 12:18.436
Let's go the same way.

12:18.576 --> 12:18.876
Yeah.

12:19.077 --> 12:22.862
My agent and my editor tell me that I'm crazy.

12:22.922 --> 12:25.666
Just send it in the way that I'm bullshit.

12:25.887 --> 12:27.048
I send it in a box.

12:27.068 --> 12:29.292
No two elastics around the damn thing.

12:29.312 --> 12:29.632
No.

12:29.933 --> 12:30.293
A box.

12:31.375 --> 12:31.495
A box.

12:31.475 --> 12:33.878
And that's the way I want to get it back.

12:33.898 --> 12:34.899
And, of course, I never do it.

12:34.919 --> 12:36.562
It comes with four elastics on it.

12:36.582 --> 12:37.683
People have rested coughing.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.545
That's how Mike came back.

12:39.566 --> 12:42.750
Coughed up snuffs and bits of chewing tobacco on it.

12:42.950 --> 12:44.512
It's a kiss in the eye.

12:46.595 --> 12:56.908
Anyway, since I went to the Macintosh, I've got a tremendously great memory that I can use.

12:57.462 --> 12:59.936
So now I can revise each day.

12:59.956 --> 13:04.401
I revise each day what was at the beginning of the chapter that I may have started with.

13:04.685 --> 13:11.996
Monday, you're keeping various versions of it, too, right?

13:12.016 --> 13:17.565
Oh, no, I revise in C2, and that becomes the concordance.

13:18.106 --> 13:21.411
So with all that memory, you can keep several variants, too.

13:21.431 --> 13:22.092
I could, but I don't want them.

13:22.112 --> 13:23.194
I get confused now.

13:23.214 --> 13:26.499
I know when it's right, and I stop rewriting it.

13:26.519 --> 13:28.622
When you erase something, it may have some good elements in it.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.403
No, I don't erase that.

13:29.423 --> 13:30.625
I put that into the copy now.

13:30.858 --> 13:37.406
I've got all the previous drafts.

13:37.426 --> 13:40.550
So they're not very attractive.

13:40.731 --> 13:45.757
I have books that there are Billy or a magician.

13:45.777 --> 13:53.727
I have, right now, three, well, two-point-something manuscripts of the book that will appear someday.

13:53.993 --> 14:16.170
but maybe not next year no he didn't give me a good enough price oh he's been he's been planning he's been planning big wetlands on my he figured sooner or later

14:16.775 --> 14:28.917
Unless they reinstate the tax deduction, and I get my own appraisal, and he gives me enough of an appraisal so that I get perfect to his collection.

14:29.017 --> 14:29.337
Oh, sure.

14:29.357 --> 14:32.944
It's actually the kind of stuff that he has.

14:32.964 --> 14:33.305
Yeah.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.130
But I am not going to give it to him.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.694
You know what they used to say.

14:38.714 --> 14:40.858
They won't expect you in the morning.

14:42.138 --> 14:46.785
But I mean, with such a body of work, really.

14:47.526 --> 14:51.251
How many books now?

14:51.272 --> 14:51.372
25.

14:51.752 --> 14:56.299
In 21 years, is that what it is?

14:56.720 --> 14:56.820
Yeah.

14:56.840 --> 14:57.521
I'm thinking of this title.

14:57.801 --> 14:59.924
It's almost, you're the fellow who said it.

14:59.944 --> 15:03.430
You hear the explanation in the newspaper 30 years ago.

15:03.830 --> 15:08.517
And you're the only one, to the best of my recollection, who has ever come up with the obvious.

15:09.104 --> 15:11.367
Talk about the furlough and butter.

15:11.387 --> 15:13.990
He said there was an explanation for all his damn hard work.

15:14.951 --> 15:15.912
Well, I like my work.

15:15.932 --> 15:16.773
I love to do it.

15:17.614 --> 15:20.898
I'm not making a sacrifice when I do it.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.700
I love to do it.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.005
Don't compare me to Trollope.

15:27.025 --> 15:29.728
Don't compare me to Trollope.

15:29.768 --> 15:30.729
That unreadable.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.174
I'm not comparing you to anybody in terms of the work ethic.

15:35.194 --> 15:36.776
The work ethic.

15:36.796 --> 15:38.318
I'm shorter.

15:38.770 --> 15:42.236
No, I can't read them.

15:42.316 --> 15:47.566
When I was in college, I pledged it.

15:47.766 --> 15:52.936
I didn't have time to read Batchester's house.

15:52.956 --> 15:58.145
So I skimmed it.

15:58.486 --> 16:02.854
I probably skimmed about a quarter of it and skipped back.

16:03.543 --> 16:06.326
And I got lucky, and I aced the exam.

16:06.487 --> 16:10.031
The question on it was to have to be tough to find it.

16:10.051 --> 16:12.214
So I've always been kind of uneasy about it.

16:12.234 --> 16:17.080
You know, that was a dishonorable thing, even though I got away with it.

16:17.100 --> 16:17.801
He is so correctable.

16:17.821 --> 16:27.913
You know, well, then we're going on a book tour in England, but it's a hiatus, and my publisher in England gives me the use of it.

16:28.231 --> 16:32.807
condo on the Costa Brava in the wintertime.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.573
It's colder than a plastic toilet seat.

16:34.593 --> 16:37.744
The place was a beautiful condo.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.654
And I knew that this was in the couch, so I brought a couple of

16:40.870 --> 16:42.693
Three copies of Trollope of me.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.195
I had Barchester Towers.

16:44.716 --> 16:47.441
And I'd have forgotten what the other two were.

16:47.461 --> 16:49.684
And I sit down in Tom's great living room.

16:49.805 --> 16:52.629
And, of course, it's book lined.

16:52.649 --> 16:53.150
It's gorgeous.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.312
It's panel, something like that.

16:54.332 --> 16:57.757
The upstairs room is this place.

16:57.777 --> 17:00.041
And I stand at Barchester Towers.

17:00.061 --> 17:00.802
I have this rule.

17:00.842 --> 17:02.966
You get 60 pages out of me.

17:03.226 --> 17:05.290
You get my attention or you're finished.

17:05.310 --> 17:05.931
I agree.

17:05.951 --> 17:07.333
And the book flies across the room.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.827
You have no obligation to finish a book.

17:10.007 --> 17:13.133
Right, I'm not in college.

17:13.153 --> 17:16.779
At page 46, Matt Tristan Towers went flying across the room.

17:16.799 --> 17:23.070
I stuck it in Tom's bookcases along with the other two troughs that I'm never going to read.

17:23.110 --> 17:28.219
You know, my opening line that I was shocked at school was boring.

17:28.279 --> 17:31.144
I tell these kids, you know, the difference between me...

17:31.934 --> 17:42.730
And your teacher gets paid to read what you write.

17:43.010 --> 17:52.044
I mean, I'm a leader who is here to be entertaining and to be inspiring.

17:52.064 --> 17:52.745
But if you don't get me, I'm gone.

17:52.765 --> 17:54.628
I'm under no obligation to read this stuff.

17:54.648 --> 17:55.449
There isn't going to be a clue.

17:55.469 --> 17:56.811
Except I impartially agree.

17:57.517 --> 18:19.910
I don't know, I can't recall now whether it was a sudden drive to the trip to review Nigel Hamilton's book, JFK, which is one of the most abysmally edited, hawkishly, badly written chapters of vandalism that I've ever had in his book.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.174
And it was long.

18:22.194 --> 18:22.594
Yeah, please.

18:22.655 --> 18:24.317
We've got to think about...

18:25.529 --> 18:40.324
I'm working on a book, and for that reason I'll never let them have anything to do with the book until I finish it.

18:40.384 --> 18:42.607
Nobody reads my books.

18:42.807 --> 18:43.067
Nobody.

18:44.008 --> 18:45.330
Including my wife.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.651
Really?

18:46.671 --> 18:47.772
You never read her past?

18:47.872 --> 18:48.113
Nope.

18:49.794 --> 18:51.276
You don't try our rhythms?

18:51.536 --> 18:53.698
Nope.

18:53.718 --> 18:55.300
Fred Allen was right.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.045
Nothing good was ever accomplished by a committee.

18:59.065 --> 19:01.147
And that's particularly true of what?

19:01.488 --> 19:02.749
There's one exception.

19:02.769 --> 19:03.049
What?

19:03.069 --> 19:04.931
The King James Bible.

19:04.951 --> 19:07.814
Yes, I would agree with that.

19:07.914 --> 19:08.255
I'm grudging.

19:09.896 --> 19:12.459
So Jack is asking what Bomber's Law was like.

19:12.479 --> 19:14.080
It was really late.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.102
My deadline was June 30th.

19:17.504 --> 19:22.969
And I didn't get it in until... Actually, I do know when I delivered it.

19:22.989 --> 19:23.650
I delivered it...

19:24.828 --> 19:27.971
in April.

19:28.532 --> 19:34.197
Well, it was 1993, not 92.

19:36.079 --> 19:39.162
So he's bugging me.

19:39.182 --> 19:43.906
I was kind of working on the novel of D and a day out of something I was teaching.

19:43.926 --> 19:44.346
I love to teach.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.408
You love to teach?

19:46.428 --> 19:47.189
Oh, I love it.

19:47.329 --> 19:48.190
Get me out of the house.

19:48.570 --> 19:50.292
I have these wonderful students.

19:50.312 --> 19:52.114
How many classes a week do you do?

19:52.134 --> 19:54.396
I carry six hours a week, but I do it all in one day.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.464
I go to office hours the same day?

19:57.005 --> 19:58.368
No office hours.

19:58.969 --> 20:03.118
The only thing office hours are far is that curry favor and kiss class.

20:03.138 --> 20:04.721
And you don't need it in my class.

20:04.821 --> 20:10.894
If you do your work, you'll get a B. And if you get inspired, you'll get an A. And if you don't do your work, I'll flunk it.

20:10.914 --> 20:11.836
That's it.

20:11.856 --> 20:12.397
That's the deal.

20:12.417 --> 20:14.241
Do you require them all to show up, too?

20:14.423 --> 20:15.505
Oh, yeah, they have to show up.

20:15.525 --> 20:17.047
They have to participate in discussion.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.089
I goad them.

20:18.229 --> 20:18.971
I insult them.

20:19.391 --> 20:23.358
We are going to have a Socratic dialogue regardless of your views on the subject.

20:23.378 --> 20:24.760
You are going to dissent.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.623
We are going to have controversy.

20:27.585 --> 20:30.730
You are going to take issue with what I have to say.

20:30.810 --> 20:37.361
The fact that I say it doesn't make it right, fiction writing and the judgment of it is purely subjective.

20:37.381 --> 20:39.485
There's no way to change it.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.887
I don't know if I'm right.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.558
But that's the way I do it.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.040
This is the way I do it.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.081
It doesn't mean I'm right.

20:45.101 --> 20:45.982
It's not the only way.

20:46.042 --> 20:47.304
And this is quite successful.

20:47.324 --> 20:51.108
And this is what I think of this particular story by Ernest Hemingway.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.591
You may not agree with me.

20:53.611 --> 20:54.932
Maybe you're right.

20:54.952 --> 21:00.599
Anyway, I would not let Jack know what I was writing about.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.461
Oh, I did tell him about two cops.

21:02.481 --> 21:03.943
They hated each other.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.507
Because for one of them, quite a while, I didn't know why they hated each other.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.710
I don't know if you've heard the radio ads like this.

21:10.851 --> 21:11.211
No.

21:11.478 --> 21:18.301
They both had very good reasons for hating each other.

21:18.321 --> 21:22.856
Well, as it got on and on into the story, now what was the question?

21:22.876 --> 21:24.120
I don't know, but I like where it's going.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.723
Yeah, but now I have to have a finish with that.

21:27.743 --> 21:30.086
Well, the effort goes on and on.

21:30.186 --> 21:31.127
I did ask the question.

21:31.147 --> 21:32.128
I finally figured it out.

21:32.148 --> 21:35.272
It said, but you read it, and you don't show them anything.

21:35.672 --> 21:36.353
I don't show anything.

21:36.513 --> 21:37.414
It started with that.

21:37.474 --> 21:44.642
Well, anyway, the story went on, and then I found out why they hated each other, and they both had very good reasons.

21:44.783 --> 21:45.664
But it's that process.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.707
I think this angle started...

21:49.497 --> 21:53.241
And you said that nobody reads your stuff, it's not even your wife.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.424
No, that was a digression.

21:55.704 --> 21:58.828
Like my carriages, I'm a butcher, but I annoy you.

21:59.329 --> 22:00.931
I am too.

22:00.951 --> 22:03.834
You often forget where you sit.

22:03.854 --> 22:05.296
It's interesting, the byway, you know.

22:05.596 --> 22:06.377
I like the byway.

22:07.518 --> 22:10.662
They're more fun than the road.

22:11.114 --> 22:17.243
I guess I'm interested in the reaction to your work in England is extraordinary.

22:17.383 --> 22:19.847
That's partly the cachet of the import.

22:19.867 --> 22:20.708
It's what?

22:20.728 --> 22:22.490
I'm a domestic here.

22:22.511 --> 22:23.532
Yeah, I'm the home zone.

22:24.013 --> 22:26.396
The profit is its own country and not all that crap.

22:26.957 --> 22:28.840
In England, I'm an import.

22:28.860 --> 22:33.426
Yeah, but nevertheless, there are dozens of scores of imports in England.

22:33.526 --> 22:38.033
Why is it that they think that you're thinking foreign so appreciatively to your...

22:38.013 --> 22:40.776
I suppose it's a freak show thing.

22:40.896 --> 22:42.238
I don't know.

22:42.258 --> 22:43.720
They think I lost.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.081
I have no idea what it is.

22:45.121 --> 22:49.046
I can give you one pass-off from this.

22:49.146 --> 22:53.071
I really like him.

22:53.171 --> 23:06.366
My father was a truly worthy English teacher who became a high school headmaster because of what he imagined to be the superior prestige

23:07.240 --> 23:12.966
And what he knew to be, correctly, is Sirius Alvin.

23:12.986 --> 23:19.752
And as a result, I never had him until he became the principal of my hometown high school.

23:19.772 --> 23:22.375
He always taught me another town.

23:22.395 --> 23:26.319
And he came into my class one day, the English teacher got sick.

23:26.339 --> 23:30.383
And my father didn't call us up to speed, he called his own man.

23:30.403 --> 23:32.745
And he came into that classroom, he was electrified.

23:32.765 --> 23:36.589
He was really beautiful.

23:37.345 --> 23:40.910
Was it a different person in your eyes?

23:41.030 --> 23:42.993
I had no idea my father could do that.

23:43.053 --> 23:49.583
I had absolutely no idea what an absolutely riveting teacher he was.

23:49.603 --> 23:51.846
I didn't even know what a riveting teacher.

23:51.866 --> 23:57.294
Did you tell him that?

23:57.314 --> 23:57.374
No.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.015
No, I didn't.

23:58.035 --> 24:00.739
He had always planned that he was going to retire early.

24:00.759 --> 24:05.766
Then he became full-time teacher, Church of the Teachers Association, MTA.

24:06.438 --> 24:10.243
And he didn't teach it all, and he didn't headmaster it.

24:10.263 --> 24:15.171
And his expectation was to retire early, 62.

24:15.191 --> 24:18.095
And he had set it up with the president of Stonehill College.

24:18.135 --> 24:25.846
He was going to teach Shakespeare, which is as many, I don't know, carry a full load, but only one course.

24:25.866 --> 24:30.493
And before that, he was going to go to England.

24:30.513 --> 24:31.895
He was a Shakespearean scholar.

24:31.915 --> 24:32.495
He really was.

24:32.515 --> 24:34.318
He studied under Kittredge, however.

24:34.670 --> 24:52.740
Unfortunately, two years before he retired, he died.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.947
And this seriously complicated his plan.

24:56.967 --> 24:58.990
So I have been braised.

24:59.527 --> 25:02.413
from the company with this notion of what he was going to do.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.999
And then I had seen what he could do with Shakespeare.

25:05.860 --> 25:08.947
Well, of course, I had seen it to a degree at home, but I didn't know I was doing it.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.330
He taught me Shakespeare.

25:10.751 --> 25:12.815
But Shakespeare I knew when I got to college.

25:12.835 --> 25:14.278
I had learned from my class from home.

25:14.478 --> 25:17.883
Not from my teacher in high school.

25:17.903 --> 25:19.785
Oh, it's God help her.

25:19.905 --> 25:24.472
Shakespeare is my passion as well, I should point out.

25:24.572 --> 25:31.241
Well, my teacher of Shakespeare in high school is a well-intentioned lady, and a very cultivated one.

25:31.321 --> 25:31.722
That's pretty good.

25:31.882 --> 25:33.144
I mean, he did that in less than a minute.

25:33.304 --> 25:34.646
They make a lot of them.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.870
You think they make a lot of Bombay martinis?

25:38.030 --> 25:38.952
Oh, no.

25:39.953 --> 25:40.013
No.

25:41.984 --> 25:59.417
So I got to England for the first time, my first trip across the water in 1972 when I was storing oil.

25:59.437 --> 26:00.820
And that was just electrifying.

26:00.884 --> 26:09.094
And in all the interviews I did, the word travels fast in the lodge that I used to work in and you working still.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.577
The word gets around in the media.

26:11.597 --> 26:12.218
This guy is all right.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.159
He really likes it here.

26:13.179 --> 26:14.841
He's in here with a chip on his shoulder.

26:15.101 --> 26:18.245
And I suppose it was that apprehension.

26:18.345 --> 26:20.468
After all, I'm a Boston Irish Catholic.

26:20.989 --> 26:23.992
I might not be that tall for the English.

26:25.054 --> 26:26.115
I love the voice.

26:26.298 --> 26:31.009
The only time the English take an Irishman seriously is when he's armed.

26:31.968 --> 26:39.896
There's another one that I would like to see in print.

26:39.917 --> 26:47.445
The reason that the English, just like the Irish, is because we took their language and write it better than they do.

26:52.390 --> 26:57.115
So that may be part of it.

26:57.255 --> 27:01.840
I have always been... I think London is...

27:02.191 --> 27:08.662
The people I know who are... As likable as some people are, it's irrelevant to whether or not they like their writing.

27:08.742 --> 27:10.545
But that reinforced it.

27:10.565 --> 27:10.725
I guess.

27:10.785 --> 27:13.029
And I got there just as the book was coming out.

27:13.069 --> 27:15.193
There weren't that many people who knew that.

27:15.213 --> 27:16.074
You're not an easy read.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.597
I mean, people... No, I'm not.

27:17.617 --> 27:20.622
And that's another thing I want to talk about.

27:21.833 --> 27:25.177
Every single book on the New York Times that's sold was about 15.

27:25.457 --> 27:28.961
It used to be 10 when any quote made it to number 5.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.844
Selling fewer than 25,000 copies in a year.

27:31.864 --> 27:33.686
Every single book on that list was 15.

27:33.766 --> 27:38.591
Now it sold 40,000 copies in a month from what I did.

27:38.611 --> 27:44.077
Almost none of them has been reviewed at the time of publication by the New York Times Book Review.

27:44.097 --> 27:49.022
The New York Times Book Review has become irrelevant to the creation of its own list.

27:50.065 --> 27:55.013
And that is because... I review for the times a couple of years.

27:55.574 --> 28:03.907
The reason for that is because the books that get on the list now are passive, like television.

28:03.927 --> 28:05.249
The consumer is passive.

28:05.369 --> 28:07.232
We do nothing.

28:07.252 --> 28:11.338
We do not need a brain to read The Bridges of Madison County.

28:11.458 --> 28:13.381
We're cleaning sales with quality, I think.

28:13.401 --> 28:15.204
Yes, we are.

28:15.224 --> 28:16.326
Maybe that's not a fair...

28:16.795 --> 28:19.940
No, we are equating sales with sales.

28:19.980 --> 28:21.122
That's right.

28:21.182 --> 28:26.972
The Madison County thing, it's like going to be living to see.

28:26.992 --> 28:29.216
A brain is a serious handicap.

28:29.236 --> 28:30.778
A brain is a bad.

28:30.818 --> 28:34.905
Did you read the Times things last week that the guy said, what gifts did you give?

28:35.223 --> 28:38.967
I think he said this Madison County guy.

28:39.328 --> 28:46.416
He'd give Darwin this, and he'd give him a Howard Stern tape, and ask him if he still believes in evolution.

28:47.237 --> 28:49.019
Some publicity agent wrote that.

28:49.099 --> 28:49.740
It's pretty good.

28:50.321 --> 28:53.785
It wasn't a bad line, but I don't think Wall wrote that.

28:54.505 --> 28:58.530
Anyway, I write books for active readers.

28:58.662 --> 29:00.846
You can't skim your books.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.810
I am not trying to tell you what to think.

29:03.150 --> 29:05.415
I mean, you could say that.

29:05.515 --> 29:07.939
You could probably say that it's impossible to skim your books.

29:07.959 --> 29:08.621
Oh, no, you can do it.

29:08.641 --> 29:10.184
You can read them for young people.

29:10.204 --> 29:11.887
I want that to be possible.

29:11.907 --> 29:15.253
If you're in a sort of tired, weary mood,

29:15.520 --> 29:22.849
and you really don't want to think too much, and you've been reading the book, and you feel as though you ought to read some more of it.

29:22.949 --> 29:24.470
I do a lot of skimming.

29:24.490 --> 29:27.334
I think you can... I miss nuances, and I miss... Well, yes, you will.

29:27.354 --> 29:29.096
You'll miss stuff.

29:29.116 --> 29:42.912
There is one passage in there that I bet you almost nobody will get, in which Brian Dennison is talking about his friend Kerry from Vietnam in the same wing of the Air Force, whose father-in-law retired,

29:43.313 --> 29:49.961
And he got deeply into birdwatching, which had always been at that location before then.

29:49.981 --> 30:01.514
And he will call him up at all hours of the day and night, particularly when he's at work as general counsel at 3M out in Minneapolis, and tell him what he's just seen that morning in the fucking swamp.

30:03.437 --> 30:07.522
And as Terry says to Brian, who's going to get kind of tiresome in for a while?

30:08.322 --> 30:10.485
And there is a play in there.

30:10.988 --> 30:21.130
which I bet there are ten people who are ever going to get it, about the prothonotary warbler and the Woodstock.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.255
And he also saw the Woodstock.

30:23.275 --> 30:24.698
Which is Winston?

30:24.738 --> 30:25.560
Winston.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.985
What are the Chambers?

30:28.859 --> 30:33.465
The prothonotary warbler was the bird that Hiss told him he had seen.

30:33.485 --> 30:35.388
When Hiss was denying he'd ever met.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.250
Well, wait.

30:37.310 --> 30:42.998
This is playing on... And Woodstock was the typewriter that proved the pumpkin papers were genuine.

30:43.559 --> 30:45.802
And Woodstock is also a bird in Peanuts.

30:46.022 --> 30:50.428
Well, you can see, you can get pretty deeply into the 7th or 8th convolution on this stuff.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.631
And I really don't expect anybody to get it.

30:52.651 --> 30:53.452
That's for me.

30:54.133 --> 30:55.034
They're having fun.

30:55.094 --> 30:55.455
Yeah.

30:55.475 --> 30:55.575
Yeah.

30:56.078 --> 30:58.250
Is it like a crossword puzzle?

30:58.290 --> 30:59.618
No, I just do this now and then.

30:59.879 --> 31:03.540
No, I just do this now and then.

31:03.790 --> 31:09.038
Are you trying to test the vital signs of your readership?

31:09.098 --> 31:12.003
Do you hear from them?

31:12.123 --> 31:13.185
Now and then I get one.

31:14.247 --> 31:19.956
I have a correspondent who's a retired professor of English out at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.

31:20.296 --> 31:26.406
He's an American national but he went up there to get a job.

31:26.386 --> 31:30.030
I got involved with him on the subject of ferret legging.

31:30.050 --> 31:35.596
Because the person who wrote ferret legging, you recall that plays a pattern in the book.

31:37.037 --> 31:40.200
And I wrote to George because I had already used it.

31:40.641 --> 31:44.305
I had already had Brennan talking about ferret legging.

31:45.826 --> 31:47.168
I heard the story years ago.

31:47.268 --> 31:49.090
I don't know who told it to me now.

31:51.252 --> 31:55.296
And it turns out he was obviously giving me the leg or else somebody was giving him the leg.

31:55.664 --> 31:56.885
Because there's no such thing.

31:56.905 --> 31:58.327
But George got on the case.

31:59.468 --> 32:05.135
And he, first of all, ascertained that that's not a recognized sport in the Highlands.

32:05.155 --> 32:14.245
And secondly, there are two men in a small village in Wales who are sick and tired of the boisterous boyos coming out of the pubs on Saturday night.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.567
And they've got a ferret named Fred.

32:15.627 --> 32:19.091
And the next time that happens, they're going to put Fred down the pants.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.794
So I sent George a copy of the book.

32:21.814 --> 32:24.557
But this sort of stuff, it's that...

32:25.533 --> 32:55.371
the wheels within the wheel that enable me they don't enable me yeah they do enable me you think that at some point let's jump ahead many years when neither one of us will be around maybe you're going I'm not I've got to get a habeas corpus and when they're whichever institution is the repository for the collecting writings of George B. Higgins

32:55.739 --> 33:03.072
Do you think there will have to be an annotated edition of each work?

33:03.092 --> 33:08.282
That is a problem for the doctoral candidates of the future, not me.

33:08.302 --> 33:09.905
I put it in there.

33:09.925 --> 33:13.271
If you can get it out, go ahead.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.956
Is it necessary in your mind for the appreciation?

33:15.976 --> 33:16.617
No.

33:17.035 --> 33:29.073
And I don't think, I didn't think when I was in college, and I don't think today, that you have to read Hollinship's Chronicles to appreciate Shakespeare's Tragedy.

33:29.093 --> 33:30.536
Read the Hamlet written by Saxon.

33:30.556 --> 33:31.577
You don't have to do that.

33:31.617 --> 33:33.079
Of course you don't.

33:33.099 --> 33:41.372
Does it enrich your scholarly, as opposed to your lizard brain, animal delight, appreciation of the tragedies?

33:41.707 --> 33:43.709
Probably not.

33:43.729 --> 33:45.812
But when you're white, it's enough for me.

33:45.832 --> 33:47.473
And that's the way I would read my book.

33:47.493 --> 33:52.279
I don't expect any reader to track me down the nights and down the days.

33:52.739 --> 34:04.112
Now, on the one hand, when these things are coming, these cute things that you're doing for yourself, they're harmless, but are you constantly being motivated by telling the good story?

34:04.132 --> 34:05.854
Yeah.

34:05.874 --> 34:06.214
Absolutely.

34:06.394 --> 34:07.055
That's my job.

34:07.075 --> 34:08.777
So even when you...

34:09.128 --> 34:29.989
I didn't know why Harry had been shipped out to Western Massachusetts.

34:29.969 --> 34:39.065
You see, that's the one that carries me right away, because he does come from a family with some means.

34:39.085 --> 34:40.868
I mean, why doesn't he quit?

34:40.889 --> 34:41.970
Why does he suffer?

34:42.251 --> 34:43.433
He likes it.

34:43.553 --> 34:45.697
He likes being an investigator.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.903
When he says he went out in North Adams.

34:48.923 --> 34:50.125
No, he wasn't in North Adams.

34:50.145 --> 34:50.626
He was in Northampton.

34:50.646 --> 34:50.866
I'm sorry.

34:50.946 --> 34:51.487
That's not true.

34:51.507 --> 34:51.808
That's true.

34:51.788 --> 34:55.713
North Adams have used it earlier books.

34:55.773 --> 34:57.396
That is really the thing.

34:57.416 --> 34:59.879
That really is the exile of Massachusetts.

34:59.899 --> 35:00.239
It is.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.162
There was a crack in there.

35:02.182 --> 35:05.346
I've got that on my short list of papers to pitch when I call them.

35:05.687 --> 35:10.634
No authors are going to go out there for a reason.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.096
North Adams daily transcripts.

35:12.116 --> 35:12.636
That's right.

35:12.656 --> 35:14.799
It's going to be one of my clients.

35:14.819 --> 35:17.543
It's an ideal outlet for my colleagues.

35:18.029 --> 35:21.935
They want a piece on George Higgins, but they don't have a staff with it.

35:21.955 --> 35:30.288
Well, just make sure for them, put in a note that I would be a piece correspondent for that earlier in 62 or 62.

35:30.348 --> 35:34.475
Maybe I'll just send them a copy of the top top unit and tell them to use it.

35:34.495 --> 35:36.117
Trying to pitch the column.

35:36.238 --> 35:36.919
Go ahead.

35:36.939 --> 35:37.319
Why not?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.503
I would.

35:39.523 --> 35:39.923
Go ahead.

35:39.943 --> 35:40.324
I'm sorry.

35:40.507 --> 35:41.168
Oh, sorry.

35:41.569 --> 35:48.299
You're talking about writing the good story, the guy, the baggage, the creative process of getting it together.

35:48.319 --> 35:48.860
Now I know why.

35:49.781 --> 35:55.851
I know that Harry's been out of town, but I don't know what Brennan had to do with it.

35:55.871 --> 36:01.840
And after a while, I find out that whatever it was, it's something that annoyed Harry's wife, and that's usually another woman.

36:02.393 --> 36:18.580
usually although i suppose now nowadays it could be another boy too the old the old sign on the lawyer says assume nothing

36:18.560 --> 36:23.005
I've learned to be a lot more circumspect in my inquiries about how's everybody?

36:23.185 --> 36:28.671
It's a dream ass out of you and me.

36:29.071 --> 36:29.592
Yeah.

36:29.652 --> 36:35.778
Don't assume a goddamn thing in the newspaper business.

36:36.319 --> 36:36.419
Yeah.

36:36.439 --> 36:36.740
Yeah.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.722
Go ahead.

36:38.742 --> 36:41.124
Well, we're getting some good quotes right now.

36:41.144 --> 36:43.206
Things start to pick up.

36:43.226 --> 36:44.668
And it will often happen...

36:45.087 --> 36:54.566
Retrospectively, my editor, not having finished the book, will call me up and say, you know, this doesn't work here.

36:55.368 --> 36:56.871
Maybe he's on page 104.

36:56.891 --> 36:57.933
Did you hear that?

36:58.114 --> 36:58.695
Yeah, I do.

36:58.835 --> 36:59.476
I explained to him.

36:59.496 --> 37:00.038
Now, wait.

37:00.939 --> 37:02.062
He says you should cut this.

37:02.182 --> 37:03.344
No, I need that.

37:03.364 --> 37:05.188
I'm going to use that later on.

37:06.772 --> 37:09.736
Well, of course, I know this because now I've finished the book.

37:09.816 --> 37:12.100
That's when he received it for the third election.

37:12.120 --> 37:16.907
But when I put it in there, I didn't know how I was going to use it.

37:16.927 --> 37:17.968
So the ferret legging.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.511
I put the ferret legging in.

37:21.333 --> 37:27.002
I put it in before George Pitonick sent me the final result of his quest.

37:27.022 --> 37:31.328
That there is no such thing and somebody had given me the leg.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.592
But no ferret, thank God.

37:34.573 --> 37:36.615
Now I've got it in there.

37:36.635 --> 37:41.180
It's easy enough to take it out, as you point out, with the computer.

37:41.861 --> 37:43.002
But I don't want to take it out.

37:43.122 --> 37:43.903
It's colorful.

37:43.923 --> 37:44.964
Do you like it?

37:45.124 --> 37:45.725
I like it.

37:46.065 --> 37:46.686
It's good stuff.

37:46.826 --> 37:47.767
It's nice.

37:47.827 --> 37:48.087
Yeah.

37:48.107 --> 37:52.192
The cheaper the hoods, the gaudier the patters, that's a lot.

37:53.894 --> 37:56.016
The cheaper the crook, I guess.

37:56.182 --> 38:00.853
I'm going to leave it in there.

38:00.873 --> 38:06.126
Now I am just about at the point where I'm writing about the confrontation of the dog track.

38:06.146 --> 38:09.013
And I didn't know that was going to happen until the day I wrote it.

38:09.033 --> 38:10.175
I never knew.

38:10.195 --> 38:11.519
And I thought that was hilarious.

38:11.619 --> 38:12.942
I really enjoyed that.

38:13.175 --> 38:17.500
I will revise that with loving hair over the next two or three days.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.823
I am a bad guy.

38:20.023 --> 38:21.585
I think it's so good.

38:21.865 --> 38:25.389
Here's George Joey getting moralistic about the white system.

38:25.409 --> 38:27.291
That gun mall fucking around.

38:27.431 --> 38:28.933
Oh, it was handsome.

38:28.953 --> 38:32.077
This is, I tell you, these are words to look like.

38:32.097 --> 38:35.741
And she's telling this, I can kill this.

38:35.761 --> 38:38.444
What I can do with this goddamn moralizing.

38:38.464 --> 38:39.385
I loved it.

38:39.365 --> 38:43.819
I would say that you love your own story.

38:43.840 --> 38:44.201
I do.

38:45.505 --> 38:46.769
I'm sorry when they're over.

38:46.889 --> 38:50.501
It's almost a post-poet.

38:50.521 --> 38:52.648
I am really sorry when my character...

38:53.084 --> 39:00.557
As they foretold, they have all vanished.

39:00.737 --> 39:08.210
Our rebels now are under.

39:08.771 --> 39:09.793
No, Ariel.

39:10.499 --> 39:13.282
Our rebels now are ended.

39:13.422 --> 39:19.728
These are active, as I have foretold you, of all spirits.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.450
And I've managed to be in there.

39:22.470 --> 39:23.612
We are such a... That's possible.

39:23.632 --> 39:23.912
Is it?

39:23.932 --> 39:24.773
It's possible to speak.

39:24.793 --> 39:25.553
Okay, you're quite right.

39:25.573 --> 39:26.134
I stand corrected.

39:26.154 --> 39:31.179
I'm not... I mean, I've used this too much.

39:31.199 --> 39:32.280
I've read it recently.

39:33.081 --> 39:33.901
Well, that's all right.

39:34.022 --> 39:36.284
You're right, anyway, however you got it.

39:36.304 --> 39:39.747
And Marnie Nixon saying the...

39:39.929 --> 39:43.857
a lot of the doodle parts for Audrey Hepburn and My Fair Lady.

39:44.478 --> 39:46.261
I just thought you'd like to know that.

39:46.281 --> 39:53.856
I was doing it with Bob Parker a couple months ago, and I asked about the next book, and it's going to be one of those big generational, it's really not going to be expensive.

39:53.876 --> 39:54.657
He mentioned it to me.

39:54.978 --> 39:55.960
It sounds horrific.

39:55.980 --> 39:56.922
It sounds great.

39:56.942 --> 39:58.565
And I said, what are you calling it?

39:58.665 --> 40:00.148
He said, All I Yesterdays.

40:00.787 --> 40:07.979
And I said, he said, all I yesterday, and then I said, have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

40:07.999 --> 40:16.332
He said, it's such a pleasure to be interviewed by somebody.

40:16.312 --> 40:19.260
This is a nice title.

40:19.340 --> 40:20.624
It is.

40:20.704 --> 40:23.953
I loved his last book, by the way.

40:24.053 --> 40:27.924
So did I. It's the best thing that Bob ever did.

40:28.746 --> 40:30.130
You know why?

40:30.170 --> 40:31.333
And I told him.

40:31.313 --> 40:33.097
I went to his house.

40:33.117 --> 40:38.511
I think it was the refreshment that he got from Eric Melvin.

40:38.531 --> 40:38.651
Right.

40:38.671 --> 40:41.358
It turned into foolishness.

40:41.378 --> 40:41.478
Yeah.

40:41.498 --> 40:46.571
Because it got him out of the... I don't know how Bob has read so many books about the same character.

40:46.591 --> 40:49.137
I've written three about the same character.

40:49.893 --> 40:58.871
And they've done the two, the first two were five years ago.

40:58.891 --> 41:01.035
I could never do one either.

41:01.055 --> 41:04.643
However, there is a world of Georgians, right, isn't there?

41:04.663 --> 41:04.843
Oh, yeah.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.749
Now and then there's a sort of reference to our cameo.

41:07.769 --> 41:08.290
Now and then...

41:08.540 --> 41:12.345
Parker and I group each other.

41:12.525 --> 41:15.529
Every once in a while.

41:15.749 --> 41:21.476
Gary Kennedy, when he's talking about bad-eye mold.

41:21.576 --> 41:27.363
Yeah, but there's a good, there's a good private eye around.

41:27.383 --> 41:29.606
Yeah, and somebody named Stratford or something, but he thinks he's a sort of just about to go down.

41:29.626 --> 41:30.066
Yeah, I remember that.

41:30.086 --> 41:32.069
So in Parker's next book, he said, the lawyer was a B.C.

41:32.089 --> 41:32.549
law guard.

41:32.629 --> 41:36.454
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

41:38.729 --> 41:46.383
There was a woman down in Miami who wrote for me.

41:46.443 --> 41:56.281
And there's a line in Mandeville, Dallas, in which Cory is in the office of the investigator in Springfield.

41:56.301 --> 41:59.206
And he said, in the room, they came and went talking to Michelangelo.

42:00.608 --> 42:01.530
And she wrote for action.

42:01.932 --> 42:07.103
a letter to me because the trouble is tracking me down to sending the letter to my agent.

42:07.123 --> 42:08.767
And I always cancel those letters.

42:08.787 --> 42:09.127
Always.

42:10.330 --> 42:12.455
My hander runs the subway.

42:12.475 --> 42:14.198
On that computer.

42:14.399 --> 42:15.942
But I sign them.

42:16.833 --> 42:24.511
I use my own stationery, so if they are collectors, they can have it.

42:25.253 --> 42:27.839
That was the reason I asked.

42:27.859 --> 42:30.144
And she was like, all right.

42:30.164 --> 42:31.648
Well, we can get on to that subject, too.

42:31.668 --> 42:32.489
I'm good for several hours on that topic.

42:32.510 --> 42:33.351
I'd be interested to hear it.

42:33.372 --> 42:34.875
She said, what does Michelangelo have to do with that?

42:35.176 --> 42:38.124
was anything in that story.

42:39.147 --> 42:40.090
And so I said, look, I just have a spot.

42:40.912 --> 42:45.846
I sit at this pipe where I have this machine all day long, and I'm all by myself.

42:45.906 --> 42:48.493
And now and then I get a little bit goofy.

42:48.862 --> 42:50.785
And I just threw in the line from C.S.

42:50.805 --> 42:52.528
Eliot because of it.

42:52.549 --> 42:53.250
That's what I do.

42:53.450 --> 42:57.257
And it doesn't have anything to do with the story.

42:57.277 --> 42:59.260
And she wrote back and thanked me so duly.

42:59.721 --> 43:03.087
Now, of course, she took the end of the town out of the library, I'm sure.

43:03.688 --> 43:08.697
And I didn't make a dollar off this moment, but she... It takes time to think about it.

43:09.018 --> 43:11.041
I like that kind of a reader.

43:11.322 --> 43:12.404
She's reading you.

43:13.065 --> 43:13.165
Yeah.

43:13.499 --> 43:39.270
Tell me, George, are you working on a... I mean, do you see all of these 25 books in 23 years, 21 years, 50 books that's projected?

43:40.010 --> 43:42.614
you know, over the next... I have no idea.

43:42.634 --> 43:53.129
Whatever, but I mean, you see it as part of a corpus thing that, you know, when you talk about a... Bob Parker has done an excellent number of books, and I'm not bringing him into this place.

43:53.149 --> 44:00.159
Oh, John Cheever was right, and then Bob Parker... Everybody else I know was industrial.

44:00.800 --> 44:03.204
He stepped up on the plate and taken the cup.

44:03.424 --> 44:04.726
Industrial.

44:04.746 --> 44:05.107
Okay.

44:05.667 --> 44:08.031
It's like Bobby Dole was about baseball.

44:08.051 --> 44:09.493
It's King Day, you play.

44:09.845 --> 44:14.872
Even though you're maybe a little off your feet, you go out and you play and you take your rips.

44:15.093 --> 44:17.256
And if you don't do well, well, you get them small.

44:17.596 --> 44:20.040
But you show up and you do your job.

44:20.641 --> 44:21.802
And that's what writers do.

44:21.822 --> 44:30.195
It always amuses me and in part annoys me when people say, you just had a book out last year.

44:30.395 --> 44:31.797
Why have you got a book out this year?

44:31.817 --> 44:32.578
You go to work.

44:33.200 --> 44:41.554
On public transportation, you walk past somebody else's house, and there's a bricklayer there, a mason putting up a brick wall.

44:41.574 --> 44:43.498
You go by in the morning, he's got his string out.

44:44.900 --> 44:48.005
And when you come back that night, he's laid 20 foot of bricks.

44:49.027 --> 44:49.849
That's what he does.

44:50.430 --> 44:51.191
That's what masons do.

44:51.211 --> 44:52.693
They lay bricks.

44:52.713 --> 44:53.655
Nobody's surprised.

44:54.142 --> 44:57.847
And the next morning when you go out, it's still that same 20 foot of brick.

44:57.867 --> 45:01.211
But when you get home that night, it's 40 foot of brick.

45:01.231 --> 45:02.533
And so on and so on.

45:02.553 --> 45:04.575
And nobody's surprised.

45:04.595 --> 45:14.708
Nobody's surprised when the guy who buys the 18th year from Omaha to Boston, goes from Omaha to Boston, puts on another road here, goes from Boston to Omaha.

45:14.728 --> 45:15.590
That's what he does.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.595
But when writers write, people say, oh, you're still writing.

45:20.536 --> 45:21.878
Of course, that's what we're doing.

45:22.659 --> 45:23.760
That's what we do.

45:24.196 --> 45:28.863
We're incorrigible.

45:29.043 --> 45:30.845
It's my job.

45:30.885 --> 45:32.127
That's what I do.

45:32.448 --> 45:34.831
It's not a profession.

45:35.131 --> 45:37.475
No profession is self-collecting.

45:37.635 --> 45:48.951
Profession, by definition, the entry is controlled by a board that determines whether you deserve the credential.

45:48.971 --> 45:50.773
There is no such board for life.

45:50.793 --> 45:51.975
There is such a board...

45:52.394 --> 45:56.842
a shadow war that's determined to just be a war.

45:56.862 --> 45:58.204
But they're all political anyway.

45:58.224 --> 45:58.825
Yes, they are.

46:00.047 --> 46:01.810
And it is absurd.

46:02.471 --> 46:03.613
Absolutely.

46:03.633 --> 46:04.214
It's ridiculous.

46:04.374 --> 46:17.657
And it would be laughable in any other context that Tony Morrison is... I was just going to say that.

46:17.677 --> 46:18.418
It is absurd.

46:19.023 --> 46:28.785
There's someone who's written quote-unquote six books, only four of which are even arguably worthwhile.

46:28.965 --> 46:35.800
Two of them are absolutely negligible, only one of which is truly of merit, and that's beloved.

46:36.674 --> 46:38.317
You should receive the Nobel Prize.

46:38.477 --> 46:40.720
That's the one I liked least, by the way.

46:40.740 --> 46:42.583
Well, that's the only one I saw any merit in.

46:42.803 --> 46:45.668
But I must confess, I've become very impatient by that.

46:45.688 --> 46:49.213
Now, I will say, I had lunch, dinner.

46:49.694 --> 46:55.904
I use Boston for my book.

46:55.924 --> 47:02.233
Or New England.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.255
Because I don't have to work at all.

47:06.307 --> 47:13.755
And that, in my explanation, has that.

47:14.015 --> 47:14.596
I don't do that.

47:14.616 --> 47:24.086
Everybody involved in the enterprise, first the writer, then the reader, ultimately the reader, knows that a novel is a fact of life.

47:24.106 --> 47:26.869
Goes well planned.

47:27.330 --> 47:32.455
So I've got to make the reader suspend his disbelief.

47:32.476 --> 47:34.778
And the way to do that is to make

47:35.163 --> 47:42.090
the reader believe correctly that the writer really knows what he's talking about.

47:42.110 --> 47:45.333
And one of the things you have to talk about is where the characters are.

47:45.353 --> 47:46.714
So I put them where I am.

47:48.015 --> 47:52.119
I change things all over the place.

47:52.399 --> 47:58.205
But the place is always going to be normal.

47:58.385 --> 47:59.586
But how about the characters?

47:59.766 --> 48:00.747
Are they all part of a family?

48:02.168 --> 48:02.228
No.

48:02.248 --> 48:03.870
Now, Louise Woodrick, for instance...

48:04.222 --> 48:28.815
It gives you a schematic of all the characters and the relationships.

48:28.835 --> 48:29.516
I have no intention of doing that.

48:29.536 --> 48:32.139
I am willing to play ball me so much in William Fox and a yacht on the top of the county.

48:32.159 --> 48:32.880
I've gone about as far as I'm going.

48:32.900 --> 48:33.621
Every so often I'll have a yacht on.

48:34.192 --> 48:42.985
By a character from another book.

48:43.245 --> 48:46.770
But again, that's having fun.

48:46.790 --> 48:51.557
Yeah, and there's another reason why you don't do it.

48:51.577 --> 48:54.601
It's by some odd chance you sell a book to the movies.

48:54.621 --> 48:56.564
They own every character in it.

48:56.584 --> 48:57.165
But it's a factor.

48:57.185 --> 48:59.909
The Diggers game was sold for the movies.

48:59.929 --> 49:00.289
It was never made.

49:00.309 --> 49:01.431
The characters in the Diggers game, therefore, belong to

49:02.491 --> 49:26.753
Well, actually one of them did.

49:32.438 --> 49:32.498
No.

49:34.469 --> 49:40.722
It's too hard for me.

49:40.742 --> 49:53.187
The last time that a producer and a writer and a director took an option on the Kennedy book.

49:55.563 --> 50:03.359
to make it into a television series.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.363
They follow the usual procedure.

50:05.383 --> 50:09.912
Everybody knows that Hollywood... George, excuse me.

50:09.932 --> 50:11.175
I'm Ristow, AP, early 60s.

50:11.195 --> 50:11.415
Oh, yeah.

50:11.435 --> 50:12.638
How are you?

50:12.818 --> 50:17.047
Very happy for your success.

50:17.067 --> 50:17.267
Thank you.

50:17.247 --> 50:29.707
Everybody knows that Hollywood banking mobiles don't read books of any kind.

50:29.987 --> 50:34.094
So a five-page phrase C is prepared.

50:34.114 --> 50:41.486
A five-page phrase C is prepared of each book that is proposed to purchase for television rights.

50:41.506 --> 50:43.609
And the people who are going to do the Jerry Kennedy television miniseries

50:43.589 --> 50:48.197
based on then two books.

50:48.217 --> 51:01.581
Walked into the meeting with the people who had received the five-page Tracy approximately three weeks before and discovered that they, the producers, were the only people in the room who knew who Jerry Kennedy was.

51:01.561 --> 51:05.769
They haven't read the five days.

51:05.789 --> 51:11.540
Do you seriously think that people who work that way can make their way through the digger's game?

51:11.560 --> 51:14.266
Can't make their way through the digger's game?

51:14.466 --> 51:21.039
Do you think they can get their way through the farmer's law?

51:21.059 --> 51:21.219
I don't.

51:21.239 --> 51:21.560
Who has farmers?

51:21.580 --> 51:21.780
Thousands.

51:21.997 --> 51:22.959
Let me say something.

51:22.979 --> 51:28.189
If I could write the kind of shit that they buy, I would do it.

51:28.209 --> 51:30.012
Give me a definition for Barman's Watch.

51:30.473 --> 51:32.156
There's a purpose to this question.

51:32.176 --> 51:36.865
Ah, this is the one that I gave my editor when he was trying to get his hands on it before I was ready to let him do it.

51:37.827 --> 51:39.751
He asked me, well, compare it to something.

51:39.971 --> 51:41.053
I think he meant another book.

51:41.253 --> 51:42.556
No, I don't mean the book.

51:42.636 --> 51:45.321
I mean the title, the actual Barman's Watch.

51:46.145 --> 51:48.788
a working definition for what Barman's Law is.

51:49.068 --> 51:53.653
When you can't tell why a guy did a thing, you always know why he did it.

51:53.673 --> 51:55.215
He did it for the money.

51:55.235 --> 51:56.536
Now, do you understand?

51:57.157 --> 52:01.582
I hope I'm not going to overreach here.

52:01.602 --> 52:09.531
There are certain titles that become idiots, that enter the language, that write stuff, catch the point, too.

52:09.551 --> 52:14.756
And there is, in my mind, almost this quality to this.

52:14.776 --> 52:15.477
Yeah, I hope so.

52:15.710 --> 52:16.311
Is that nice?

52:16.531 --> 52:17.452
Have you heard that before?

52:17.472 --> 52:20.036
I have not heard that before.

52:20.136 --> 52:26.044
But I hope you're right.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.228
I hope you're right.

52:29.449 --> 52:30.750
I really do.

52:30.810 --> 52:32.753
That would be very nice.

52:32.773 --> 52:45.430
I notice a lot of people, and 20 years after the fact, 21 years after the fact, I'm sure that in most instances it's quite inadvertent, but they refer to

52:45.629 --> 52:51.774
combinations of individuals working toward a common goal, as the friends are.

52:51.794 --> 52:54.617
I think I know where they got it.

52:54.697 --> 52:55.858
I don't think they do.

52:56.779 --> 52:57.359
That's right.

52:57.379 --> 53:01.543
Well, the world according to so-and-so, yeah, they've never read the book.

53:01.563 --> 53:04.466
And they've never heard of Garth, and they don't know what happened to the gear.

53:04.486 --> 53:10.711
But they've been influenced by something, you know?

53:10.731 --> 53:13.514
That's the greatest compliment you can make.

53:13.534 --> 53:14.995
You pick up any work of Shakespeare.

53:15.262 --> 53:17.907
You know, the unkindest kind of all is Greek to me.

53:17.987 --> 53:24.900
I mean, these are all Greek books.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.904
But it is an interesting book.

53:26.924 --> 53:28.647
Oh, let's go.

53:29.148 --> 53:33.596
I didn't even know how Barber got his name until I wrote that stuff.

53:33.616 --> 53:35.700
At the end, the very last page of the book.

53:36.288 --> 53:37.150
I didn't know that.

53:37.912 --> 53:39.575
All I knew that he was Barmer.

53:39.595 --> 53:41.139
So when did the title come in for you?

53:42.422 --> 53:46.270
Well, it kicked in when Dennison said Barmer's Law.

53:46.551 --> 53:47.433
And that's really early.

53:47.633 --> 53:50.740
I think it's around page 80.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.807
When he stopped talking about the housing.

53:55.525 --> 54:01.861
There is a Murphy's Law, which everybody knows.

54:02.222 --> 54:03.485
Remember the Peter Principles?

54:03.505 --> 54:03.866
Yep.

54:03.986 --> 54:06.251
These things didn't make it quite as big as the other ones.

54:06.272 --> 54:07.214
Oh, the Peter Principles did.

54:07.515 --> 54:08.236
You feel upward.

54:08.256 --> 54:09.540
I love the Peter Principles.

54:09.560 --> 54:11.745
I think Joe Fox, the editor at Randhouse...

54:12.046 --> 54:14.169
is one of the great examples of the Peter Pritzker.

54:14.189 --> 54:16.191
He married Kaz Canfield's daughter.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.032
Well, that does it.

54:17.052 --> 54:18.875
That's how he got into publishing.

54:19.235 --> 54:22.980
And he was... He failed upward to his level of his own in common.

54:23.060 --> 54:27.626
And he was watching Nora Ephring, you know, and... He's the guy, by the way.

54:27.686 --> 54:36.538
I don't need this... For 30 years, Danny Laferriere has been haunted by a single scene from his youth in Haiti.

54:37.579 --> 54:39.842
It is the summer of 1963.

54:40.075 --> 54:50.145
and a ten-year-old boy sits on the outdoor gallery of a provincial home a few kilometers outside Port-au-Prince with a smiling, peaceful old woman known only as Da.

54:51.426 --> 54:57.472
The old woman is my grandmother, he writes in his autobiographical novel, An Aroma of Coffee.

54:58.033 --> 54:58.913
The boy is me.

54:59.955 --> 55:07.602
This evocative, fictionalized memoir, beautifully depicted through the recollections of the child, is a mosaic of sparkling images

55:07.885 --> 55:10.068
delicately translated by David Hummel.

55:11.029 --> 55:16.536
Fact, folklore, gossip, and superstition are effortlessly refracted to the prism of memory.

55:17.498 --> 55:24.447
The youngster thinks a dragonfly being devoured by flying ants is just as diverting as a mysterious dark room at the back of his house.

55:25.308 --> 55:34.500
He is afraid of a long-haired she-devil with red eyes, black nails, and crooked fingers who can, quote, change herself into any animal, even in broad daylight.

55:35.611 --> 55:40.076
He loves the smell of the soil and the rain, of the sea beyond the coconut palms.

55:40.917 --> 55:47.384
Life's daily rhythms are interrupted only by a noontime sun that paralyzes everyone.

55:48.766 --> 55:51.489
One day I asked her to tell me about paradise, he explains.

55:52.170 --> 55:53.632
She showed me her coffee pot.

55:54.813 --> 56:01.040
In it was the coffee from Les Palms that she prefers, mostly because of its aroma.

56:01.961 --> 56:04.504
She explains that the sky is blue because of the sea.

56:05.159 --> 56:08.002
For a long time I thought the sea and the sky were one, he says.

56:08.042 --> 56:10.764
The sea has fishes, the sky stars.

56:11.164 --> 56:13.126
Rain is the proof that the sky is liquid.

56:14.447 --> 56:23.896
Mr. Laferriere, a journalist during the Duvalier regime, who went into exile in Canada in 1978 and now lives in Miami and Montreal, is the author of two previous novels.

56:25.057 --> 56:27.639
In this new one, he pays homage to the innocent times.

56:28.300 --> 56:31.943
Most of all, he has created a loving tribute to a wise and wonderful woman.

56:32.824 --> 56:34.525
My name is Nicholas Basmanes.
