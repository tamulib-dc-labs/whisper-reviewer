Hello, I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington, and this is Prime Time Radio.

00:10.272 --> 00:21.147
In this program, we'll talk with Secretary of Labor Robert Reich about a new program in which the public and private sectors are uniting with a single purpose, to make Americans aware of the necessity for saving more for retirement.

00:21.608 --> 00:29.498
With savings rates fluctuating but still historically low, we'll tell you why what you planned on when you were 50 is probably not going to be enough at 65.

00:29.478 --> 00:37.722
We'll also talk with the president of an institute that has as its main purpose the collection and dissemination of accurate information about retirement benefits and strategies.

00:38.224 --> 00:42.998
We'll also meet the woman who almost single-handedly began the women's health movement, Barbara Seaman.

00:43.282 --> 00:50.317
She turned up evidence that the use of the pill that shocked women and altered forever the way many women regarded their doctors and drug companies.

00:50.798 --> 00:57.332
A mother, when she realized what had to be done, she's now a grandmother and still at it, organizing women to be more active in their relationships with doctors.

00:57.693 --> 01:00.158
A busy hour ahead, so stay tuned.

01:00.178 --> 01:00.278
Music

01:11.210 --> 01:12.313
Hello, I'm Mike Cuthbert.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.277
Welcome to Primetime Radio.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.888
The other night I got a call from a former neighbor I had not heard from for over 40 years.

01:19.129 --> 01:21.735
He got my number from a high school alumni yearbook that just came out.

01:22.035 --> 01:23.599
He decided to call me on a whim.

01:23.849 --> 01:27.634
Two years older than me, turns out he's been retired for several years.

01:28.014 --> 01:29.476
He sounded like he was enjoying himself.

01:29.876 --> 01:32.600
He must have planned well since he's not yet 60.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.061
How well have you planned?

01:34.502 --> 01:41.771
Are you confident that at 57 your days could be spent on the golf course and your weekends on your boat fishing in Florida, like my former neighbor?

01:42.331 --> 01:45.996
Or are you like an increasing number of people I talk with who laugh at the word retirement?

01:46.376 --> 01:46.977
Retirement?

01:47.458 --> 01:51.122
Well, it's simply not on your horizon because you never expect to stop working.

01:51.473 --> 02:02.425
In the next half hour or so, we'll look at the demands that retirement places on you, and we hope you'll give you some information that may help you determine whether or not that retirement that you'd like to anticipate is possible and what you have to do to make it possible.

02:02.946 --> 02:05.068
We certainly have qualified help to lead our discussion.

02:05.469 --> 02:08.653
With us in our Washington studios is Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.

02:08.673 --> 02:12.076
Joining him is Dallas Salisbury, President of the Employee Benefit Research Institute.

02:12.136 --> 02:12.757
Welcome, gentlemen.

02:12.777 --> 02:13.498
Good to see you both.

02:13.478 --> 02:14.099
Good to be here.

02:14.299 --> 02:21.611
Secretary Reich, we know what you do pretty much, but for just a moment, let's find out what Mr. Salisbury does with the Employment Benefit Research Institute.

02:22.552 --> 02:33.850
Mike Ebrey was started in 1978, and we try to provide a broad base of information and data on pension, health, retirement planning, and savings issues for the media and for people in the public.

02:34.218 --> 02:44.072
In that role, then, I would assume both of you are vitally interested in finding out how aware is the average worker of the demands he's going to face in retirement.

02:44.432 --> 02:48.478
How well educated, how aware is the average worker of what he's going to need, Secretary Rice?

02:48.498 --> 02:54.746
Mike, as I go around the country, I am struck by how little people know about savings and retirement.

02:55.347 --> 02:56.108
Gone forever.

02:56.358 --> 03:03.452
are the days when you could join a company for 30 years and retire with a gold watch and a nice pension plan and not have to worry about it.

03:03.893 --> 03:09.243
These days, more workers do have to take more responsibility, but there is not yet the information out there that they need.

03:09.784 --> 03:10.045
Why?

03:10.305 --> 03:11.087
What's happened?

03:12.329 --> 03:17.860
Well, we've ended up seeing individuals faced with major corporate consolidations.

03:18.363 --> 03:32.918
The small business that had 40 or 50 people in the community, the title insurance companies that were in every community, and they had their own career workers, they're all owned by some multinational corporation now, and they get swallowed up in a very different way.

03:33.679 --> 03:37.323
So individuals really also face the Social Security issue.

03:37.763 --> 03:43.089
Back when my great-grandmother retired, there were 35 people paying taxes to support her benefits.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.914
By the time we baby boomers retire, there'll be two workers to pay those benefits.

03:48.181 --> 04:06.274
It changes the dynamic, and the good news is that whereas my great-grandmother's life expectancy was well below age 65, ours is now pushing up, and if you hit age 65, you now readily can expect to live most people into their late 70s, 80s, and some into their 90s and beyond.

04:06.760 --> 04:12.737
So both there's a cost pressure and also it's just we all face the joy of living longer.

04:12.818 --> 04:14.242
That means you've got to have more money.

04:14.422 --> 04:20.500
It means you have to have saved earlier, more often, more aggressively, and thought about it if you think you want to retire.

04:20.885 --> 04:29.461
Companies are putting more and more responsibility on their employees, Mike, in terms of 401K plans, which are basically defined contribution plans.

04:29.762 --> 04:32.246
Companies may join you, but you've got to make the investment decisions.

04:32.487 --> 04:38.057
You have a lot more options as a worker as to how much you save, how you save, whether you save.

04:38.698 --> 04:40.682
But also, let's face it.

04:40.983 --> 04:46.871
Most workers these days are not able to save nearly as much as a generation before because wages have not kept up.

04:47.672 --> 04:54.261
And indeed, the average 50-year-old man today has not had a raise if you adjust for inflation in 20 years.

04:54.301 --> 05:02.012
One of the problems that I see as I talk to people around my neighborhood and read the press around the country is,

05:02.448 --> 05:12.927
is that apparently a lot of workers, particularly in their 30s and 40s, simply don't believe Social Security is going to be there when they retire, and yet we don't hear any drastic rise in their savings rates.

05:13.408 --> 05:16.594
What are these people expecting is going to be there when they retire?

05:17.175 --> 05:24.388
Well, they actually, in our surveys, they both say they don't think it'll be there, and then when you ask the next question,

05:24.925 --> 05:27.435
What are you going to rely on for your retirement income?

05:28.118 --> 05:32.556
An amazing number say that they expect Social Security to provide half of their income.

05:33.245 --> 05:50.877
So there's a context in between here, and it may well be that if you ask people a cute question about UFOs or social security, they choose the UFO because they think it's cute, but it may not actually reflect people yet being as realistic they should be about the future.

05:51.679 --> 05:54.063
And it's not that social security won't be there.

05:54.283 --> 05:55.185
It will be there.

05:55.503 --> 06:05.200
But we've not been as blunt with people over time about what Social Security, in fact, doesn't provide in the way of a totally great lifestyle.

06:05.701 --> 06:15.739
The magazines and the TV shows about people out on the golf course and on their boats in the harbors of Florida, those are not people that are living exclusively on Social Security.

06:16.242 --> 06:26.522
So part of this is the education effort that the Department of Labor and the Institute and many other public and private organizations are undertaking to basically say to people,

06:27.008 --> 06:40.144
Focus now, focus early, begin to plan, begin to save, and understand that if you want the lifestyle that we frequently picture as the golden years, you will have to have saved a great deal yourself.

06:40.585 --> 06:45.891
Mike, some statistics that are actually a little bit, if not alarming, then at least interesting to people.

06:46.372 --> 06:52.459
We did a survey of 50,000 households a couple of weeks ago, found that over half of retirees are dependent on

06:52.777 --> 06:54.901
on Social Security as their only pension.

06:55.101 --> 06:56.563
They don't have any private pension at all.

06:57.124 --> 07:03.275
And half of these people who are dependent only on Social Security get only $7,000 from Social Security.

07:03.655 --> 07:07.442
So again, as Dallas says, you're not talking about people who are very wealthy.

07:07.963 --> 07:09.786
Most of these people are just getting by.

07:09.826 --> 07:13.452
And if you add in health care costs, you see employers who...

07:13.432 --> 07:16.399
actually are providing less and less health care to retirees.

07:16.419 --> 07:22.092
In 1988, about 40% of retirees were getting employer-sponsored health care.

07:22.473 --> 07:27.103
Now, about 33% of retirees get employer-sponsored health care.

07:27.522 --> 07:38.292
We're talking, it seems to me, or it sounds to me, like a fundamental change in the attitude of employees toward their employer as sort of the guardian angel of last resort.

07:38.872 --> 07:44.577
What you're seeming to tell me is that when we're going to work, we have to approach it with a different attitude.

07:44.637 --> 07:53.646
We cannot expect a pension and the pension officer to guide us through this so that all we have to do is sign our name at the age of 65 and get the gold watch and have fun.

07:54.366 --> 07:55.167
Long gone.

07:55.670 --> 08:02.381
is the area of, to the extent that there was such an era, and we don't want to romanticize the past, but the era of corporate paternalism.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.907
Companies now don't pick up quite as much of the tab.

08:06.347 --> 08:09.933
They are cutting many benefits, but also people are changing jobs.

08:10.594 --> 08:12.798
Sometimes they want to, sometimes they don't have much of a choice.

08:13.198 --> 08:18.106
The average employee is changing job seven, eight times in a career.

08:18.387 --> 08:20.310
It's a much more dynamic situation.

08:20.695 --> 08:25.922
more exciting, fluid, but also anxiety-ridden workforce right now.

08:26.162 --> 08:29.326
And how does all that job change affect pension planning?

08:29.727 --> 08:38.538
Because it seems to me that if you are constantly changing jobs, you have to keep track of where your money was if you were vested in one firm and make sure that you get it with you when you travel.

08:38.658 --> 08:49.572
Well, it's the one major advantage of the tremendous growth of the 401k plan that the Secretary mentioned is it fits better with this highly mobile individual.

08:50.142 --> 08:55.532
And adding to the other comment the secretary made is let's not romanticize the past.

08:55.552 --> 09:04.287
It really was only the very largest corporations and government employers in America that ever provided this paternalistic cushion.

09:04.840 --> 09:20.839
Yet we wrote about it and talked about it so much that we misled the 70% of the workforce that has always worked in relatively small enterprises that didn't have all those great pension plans, didn't ever have the retiree medical, as the secretary has said.

09:20.879 --> 09:33.835
And really what we're beginning to do is deal with the bulk of the American people and talk to them about the situation that affects them rather than this romanticism that might have been.

09:34.321 --> 09:43.976
And it leads to the prospect that we have a system that may, in fact, be better molded to the changing labor force and to the bulk of the labor force.

09:43.996 --> 09:53.291
And with education and early education for people to save, we hopefully can get rid of false optimism and motivate people to do more now.

09:53.952 --> 09:57.637
That's the voice of Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute.

09:57.657 --> 10:01.223
We're also joined by Secretary Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor.

10:01.523 --> 10:12.522
All these things that we've been discussing, including the fact that most Americans don't know how much Social Security is going to provide for them, so they don't know how much they're going to need extra, needs some education.

10:12.622 --> 10:16.628
And I understand that the retirement savings education campaign is going to be launched.

10:17.229 --> 10:19.954
Why was it deemed necessary, and what is it going to do?

10:21.065 --> 10:35.103
One of the most important things people need right now, Mike, is just good information, not only about how much Social Security is going to provide, on balance, only about 40% of pre-retirement earnings, but also what they can do to maximize every dollar of savings.

10:35.163 --> 10:44.575
People are having a harder and harder time saving any money at all, so it's more important than ever that they get good information about how to make sure that those savings go longer.

10:45.044 --> 10:50.015
How is this campaign going to be different from other things we have done, media campaigns or something else?

10:50.135 --> 10:52.801
It seems, frankly looking at it, a little bit broader based.

10:53.161 --> 10:59.575
Well, we've ended up creating a group at the urging of the Department of Labor called the American Savings Education Council.

11:00.176 --> 11:04.285
That council now has over 150 public and private partners.

11:04.687 --> 11:10.032
and an excellent brochure that the Labor Department put together at the initiation of its campaign.

11:10.453 --> 11:19.882
This last week, ASEC went to print with 500,000 copies of that brochure, which will be distributed nationally by the partner organizations.

11:19.902 --> 11:30.913
The essence is a difference here is that rather than this being a slam-duck, one-shot type of advertising campaign, we're building a coalition across America that is saying,

11:31.248 --> 11:33.112
We're not going to worry about high tech.

11:33.132 --> 11:44.278
We're going to worry about a basic drumbeat message of think about the future, think about saving, begin saving, and all of these organizations are going into it with

11:44.647 --> 11:54.797
Better that we do a little bit consistently over the next two to three decades than we set some unobtainable goal and then go with a flash and stop.

11:55.178 --> 12:00.203
So I think it's the picture, it's the sustainability, it's the breadth of the coalition.

12:00.743 --> 12:09.692
And in addition, it's the dynamic leadership of Secretary Reich and others who are giving this some high visibility, some needed visibility,

12:09.672 --> 12:14.817
and inviting in a broad-based group of people to help educate the public on this issue.

12:14.837 --> 12:15.698
So I think you're right.

12:15.798 --> 12:17.920
It's very different, and I think it's sustainable.

12:18.341 --> 12:19.502
Mike, I want to return the compliment.

12:19.522 --> 12:26.349
I think Dallas and other organizations have made this a public-private partnership that ideally is going to get the word out.

12:26.389 --> 12:29.973
It's not just, as Dallas said, a one-shot over the bow.

12:30.333 --> 12:37.080
We are going to give information to people, continue to give information to people, make sure that American workers, average people who...

12:37.060 --> 12:45.833
really don't have time, often don't have the wherewithal to get the information they need about retirement, do in fact have those data.

12:46.594 --> 12:55.368
In fact, since you're talking about a brochure, how is it going to be possible for our listeners to get in touch with the American Saving Education Council, get the brochure, and find out how to get involved?

12:55.808 --> 13:01.617
They can call 202-659-0670 for purposes of that brochure.

13:02.018 --> 13:09.310
And the Labor Department has a number as well for the brochure that they have, which I'm sure you can also provide to your listeners.

13:10.271 --> 13:15.600
There is a competing, it seems to me, we constantly in this program talk about the sandwich generation.

13:15.740 --> 13:20.247
We have a number of people who are taking care of their parents on one end.

13:20.648 --> 13:30.200
their children's college education on the other, how possibly can either of you suggest a strategy for that sandwich generation to begin planning saving for retirement, for instance?

13:30.360 --> 13:35.867
Let me give you an easy example, in other words, of how you're going to educate Americans on a plan for retirement.

13:37.129 --> 13:37.750
How do they do that?

13:37.910 --> 13:40.894
Let me give you just one specific example.

13:40.914 --> 13:42.015
There are many, many examples.

13:42.383 --> 13:53.560
As I travel around the country talking to workers, blue-collar, pink-collar, low-level, white-collar worker, and I talk about this issue of savings, and they tell me, truthfully, that they just can't save.

13:54.061 --> 13:56.084
Given the pressures these days, they can't possibly save.

13:56.725 --> 14:02.434
It turns out that there are tax-free savings programs that they could get involved in.

14:02.718 --> 14:08.026
about one-third of them don't take advantage of it, although it would pay them to take advantage of it.

14:08.046 --> 14:30.278
That is, if they put a little away, just a couple of dollars a week, they would, through the magic of compound interest and because of the tax-free nature of these savings plans, have a huge, relatively speaking, not huge by huge standards, but actually a very respectable savings amount at the end of 20 or 30 or 40 years.

14:30.629 --> 14:33.753
For retirement only and still have room to handle the college?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.495
If they don't take it out.

14:35.575 --> 14:44.605
Now, again, one of the problems people have, as they have more and more responsibility for their own retirements, there's a great temptation to say, well, gee, I'd love to buy that house.

14:45.026 --> 14:46.728
I'd love to be able to afford this or that.

14:47.228 --> 14:50.492
Let me just take this retirement savings out to do that.

14:51.553 --> 14:55.658
A lot of people don't realize the cost of taking retirement savings out of a plan.

14:55.992 --> 15:02.719
What are some of those tax-free areas that you're talking about that people should look at more since, as you point out, they don't know about them now?

15:03.220 --> 15:05.302
Individual retirement accounts already there.

15:05.843 --> 15:08.245
We've already talked about 401K plans.

15:08.445 --> 15:11.869
Employers provide some financing and some help.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.011
There are others as well.

15:14.332 --> 15:17.635
The most important thing, again, is that people find out about them.

15:17.895 --> 15:25.003
These tax-free or tax-deferred savings plans do provide an enormous incentive to

15:25.237 --> 15:32.047
They provide financial kind of almost a multiplier effect when people take advantage of them.

15:32.067 --> 15:51.497
The other advantage is simply the breadth of information that's out there, the amount of material now on cable television or in the local newspaper, the number of additional finance columns, the fact that you see some of these things now in good, clean, graphic, easy-to-understood form in publications like USA Today.

15:51.477 --> 15:54.403
So we're getting more information out.

15:54.444 --> 15:55.726
It's easier to get it out.

15:56.227 --> 16:04.726
Secondly, the secretary commented on the population that only has $7,000 a year in Social Security income, and it's a large population.

16:05.368 --> 16:09.216
That hits home the fact that you do not have to accumulate money.

16:09.196 --> 16:10.859
Huge amounts of money.

16:10.919 --> 16:18.755
You don't need a million dollars in order to double your income if you're only making $7,000 a year from Social Security.

16:19.276 --> 16:23.965
So I think part of these messages can get out to individuals or getting out.

16:24.400 --> 16:39.658
And literally, if you go to one less movie a month, if you buy one less soft drink a day, there are very little things that for most Americans can add up to significant savings once they start to see it accumulate.

16:39.638 --> 16:43.904
We have to be careful, Michael, that this is not a kind of castor oil approach.

16:44.385 --> 16:45.506
You've got to take your medicine.

16:45.947 --> 16:46.648
It's good for you.

16:47.068 --> 16:47.849
You may not want to.

16:48.891 --> 17:04.853
It's important to recognize that most Americans, and I keep on hearkening back to this message, but I think it is vitally important to recognize that most Americans are now having a hard time making ends meet, whether it's college education for the kids or it's taking care of parents, as you referred to before, or it's simply...

17:04.985 --> 17:10.276
holding down two jobs or holding down extra hours in order to make ends meet.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.659
This is tough for people.

17:12.100 --> 17:17.792
So nobody is pretending that saving is going to be easy, but that's why this information is even more important than before.

17:18.053 --> 17:21.019
You've got to make sure that every dollar saved goes

17:20.999 --> 17:44.340
even further than before pardon my skepticism but when when people begin to educate people about the necessity for saving there will be a certain group of Americans entrepreneurs all who will take advantage of this with some quick money schemes for retirement they will use the necessity they will use your own education program I guess to perhaps float some scams if I again may be skeptical

17:44.692 --> 17:55.714
What part of the American Saving Education Council's work is going to be to warn people about these scams and to get them into areas where the rewards may not be as spectacular, but they are more certain?

17:55.913 --> 18:02.402
Well, the Labor Department brochure has a message in it, be careful, be prudent, be selective.

18:03.343 --> 18:10.633
And the other brochures being put together by other partners in the campaign very much go along those lines.

18:11.074 --> 18:21.128
Groups like Teachers Insurance Annuity, so-called TIACREF, and the educational market have amazing amounts of information available to people in higher education.

18:21.108 --> 18:29.902
So there's more and more of that simple message, if you will, of be careful, but take prudent action.

18:30.643 --> 18:41.860
And the Labor Department and other government agencies have programs, responsibilities in this area, the SEC, and they're continuing to take actions to try and educate the public.

18:41.921 --> 18:42.582
But you're right.

18:42.782 --> 18:48.010
There always is going to be that problem, and it's something that we all need to guard against.

18:47.990 --> 18:57.140
But we don't also want to put out the castor oil message that for fear that you might have the money taken away from fraud, don't bother to save.

18:58.301 --> 19:06.129
I think it's part of that necessity of making sure we have a fully responsible program, and all of us will be working to do that.

19:07.050 --> 19:13.997
Many factors in our society seem to be accentuating what has come to be known as the education and particularly the wage gap.

19:14.416 --> 19:18.018
What are the dangers of further class separation of Americans even in retirement?

19:18.038 --> 19:20.292
I noted, for example, in some of the material I was reading,

19:20.558 --> 19:23.581
Two-thirds of college degree workers have pension coverage on the job.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.025
Excuse me, don't have pension coverage.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.887
Three-quarter of non-college grads do.

19:29.228 --> 19:31.931
There's an education wage gap there again.

19:32.391 --> 19:37.136
What is the American Saving Education Council going to do to perhaps bring that gap closer together?

19:37.156 --> 19:48.709
Well, it's one of the things that we've stressed as a virtue of the 401k plan is even in the heydays of non-regulation and very high taxes and no government regulation,

19:48.689 --> 19:56.183
Only 12% of employees in small businesses in America had any type of retirement savings program.

19:56.784 --> 19:59.729
In spite of many changes today, that number is higher.

20:00.591 --> 20:11.170
And we now see over 450,000 employers, small employers that have created 401k plans or sponsored individual retirement accounts.

20:11.150 --> 20:19.460
that are really making available to some of these lower income, lower educational level Americans the opportunity to save for the first time.

20:20.241 --> 20:39.064
I would reinforce the Secretary's point, however, which is in many of those small firms, over half of the individuals that could be using the programs are still not using the programs, either because they're very young and don't yet think about it, or because, as he said, they have a very tight budget, which many have.

20:39.044 --> 20:53.982
So I think part of this campaign for the Labor Department and for the Council is a campaign to encourage small employers in America, medium-sized employers in America that have never created any type of retirement savings program

20:54.248 --> 21:03.056
to do that, to do that now, and to give people the opportunity to save through payroll deduction in a very tax-effective way.

21:03.436 --> 21:11.043
And to make sure that all employees have an opportunity to take advantage of these pension programs and also these health programs.

21:11.463 --> 21:21.131
One of the things, as you look at the data, and also as I travel around the country, Mike, one of the things that strikes me is, as you put it, there is a widening gap.

21:21.612 --> 21:22.973
It is related to education.

21:23.206 --> 21:29.576
in terms of accessibility to pensions, to all kinds of other company benefits.

21:29.836 --> 21:37.127
If you don't have a high school degree, you're falling off the charts in terms of the access you might have to a company pension plan.

21:37.668 --> 21:44.438
It wasn't great 20 years ago for people who barely had a high school degree, but now it's almost non-existent.

21:46.612 --> 21:50.120
We've been talking about Social Security, and everybody calls that an entitlement.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.064
Everybody assumes they are entitled to that.

21:52.125 --> 21:56.695
But what other rights do American workers have to pension coverage?

21:56.715 --> 22:01.747
Could it be, for example, that some American workers don't have pensions because they don't think they have a right to get one?

22:01.767 --> 22:03.270
They're not eligible?

22:04.212 --> 22:14.407
Well, we end up finding that of the third of the workers that have 401K plans available and that you survey them, half of them don't know that the plan is even available.

22:15.349 --> 22:24.102
And employers are trying to expand dramatically the educational efforts with their workers so that they know that that opportunity is there.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.686
They're trying to use payroll stuffers.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.730
They're going to be using the brochure of the Labor Department.

22:29.790 --> 22:32.835
They're going to be using public service announcements.

22:32.815 --> 22:34.837
and trying to get that knowledge out.

22:35.278 --> 22:36.419
But you're very correct.

22:36.519 --> 22:52.798
If individuals are trying to hold down two jobs or three jobs, they're simultaneously trying to raise some children, they may not even get around to opening the envelopes that come in the door or reading the papers that are in the payroll stuff or at work.

22:53.719 --> 22:55.281
So it isn't easy.

22:56.282 --> 23:00.207
We don't mean to imply that this is an easy process.

23:00.187 --> 23:16.040
But we do believe that is something that if you don't go about systematically trying to get that information out and get people to understand what their rights are and their opportunities are, there's no hope of change, if you will.

23:16.421 --> 23:21.030
And it's with that in mind of trying to make sure that we expand.

23:21.010 --> 23:25.918
knowledge, understanding, participation, and the rate of savings that we're going about these campaigns.

23:26.138 --> 23:36.395
Mike, one of the first questions I ask when I go into a factory or an office or any place of business, a retail establishment, and talk to workers, I say, tell me about your company pension plan.

23:36.535 --> 23:37.958
Does your employer have one?

23:38.018 --> 23:39.981
And if so, tell me about it.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.242
Often I get blank stares.

23:42.043 --> 23:45.227
Now, there are such things as defined benefit plans.

23:45.808 --> 23:47.510
They vest after a few years.

23:47.550 --> 23:52.175
That is, if you don't stay with that employer a certain number of years, you may not be entitled.

23:52.676 --> 23:55.599
Employees need to know how many years it takes to vest.

23:55.619 --> 24:01.926
That's one of the things, again, you can find out simply by talking to your employer, talking to the personnel chief in your company.

24:02.447 --> 24:03.268
You need to know.

24:04.328 --> 24:13.465
Mr. Secretary, everything we've been talking about in this half hour assumes that pension rights will be protected regardless of who wins elections and what the nature of the Congress will be.

24:13.966 --> 24:19.235
As you look at everything we've been talking about, what is beyond politics and what is not?

24:19.596 --> 24:27.130
In other words, can people plan on what's going to come out of the American Savings Education Council to be there, or is politics going to

24:27.110 --> 24:28.752
maybe wrench everything around again.

24:28.912 --> 24:31.596
Well, Mike, first of all, Social Security is going to be there.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.739
Americans would not stand for any erosion of Social Security.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.281
I think it's a right.

24:36.762 --> 24:38.224
It is something people are counting on.

24:38.284 --> 24:40.627
There will not be any change in that, though.

24:40.807 --> 24:47.295
Over the long term, as baby boomers move into their retirement years, obviously, there are going to have to be some reforms.

24:47.275 --> 24:51.701
Number two, we do have to make sure that private pensions are fully funded.

24:51.861 --> 24:54.044
Now, we have new legislation on the books.

24:54.425 --> 25:01.875
President Clinton signed it and initiated it, which requires companies over a period of time, if they're underfunded, to fully fund their pension plans.

25:02.436 --> 25:07.663
I have to tell you, I'm a little concerned right now because the House of Representatives has opened the barn door.

25:08.065 --> 25:20.743
They are proposing new legislation that would allow companies to use any surpluses in their private pension plans to do whatever they want with, like the 1980s when all those leverage buyouts, remember that?

25:20.763 --> 25:25.770
And hopefully we can close that barn door before it actually opens all the way.

25:25.750 --> 25:32.816
Beyond those issues, it seems to me, individuals have potentially an enormous responsibility.

25:33.117 --> 25:34.818
This is where information comes in.

25:35.339 --> 25:38.401
There are no rights, but there are a lot of responsibilities.

25:38.762 --> 25:41.885
Employers are, for the most part, acting responsibly.

25:42.265 --> 25:44.227
I think individuals do need to know more.

25:44.447 --> 25:45.468
They need to ask questions.

25:45.768 --> 25:47.349
Often they don't know what questions to ask.

25:47.750 --> 25:53.395
And this is where this public-private partnership we've entered into is so vitally important.

25:53.855 --> 25:55.757
Information is the key.

25:55.737 --> 26:01.622
Mr. Salisbury, Secretary Reich seems quite confident about the political realities, with the possible exception he just noted.

26:01.944 --> 26:02.727
What about you?

26:03.314 --> 26:08.319
Well, I would agree with the Secretary on his statement that Social Security is there for the long term.

26:08.980 --> 26:13.545
I think what people need to focus there is not on the politics, it's on the reality.

26:14.145 --> 26:24.616
And the reality is that for most Americans, Social Security does not provide an adequate retirement income today, won't tomorrow, and if they want a full income, they're going to need to save.

26:25.277 --> 26:29.001
So it's not really the politics as much as understanding.

26:28.981 --> 26:32.685
In terms of the private pension system, it's growing, it's strong.

26:33.346 --> 26:43.498
There have been some side political issues like the Secretary referenced, but the bill that he was enacted to help fund pension plans is one that was worked on for many years.

26:43.859 --> 26:52.990
It is proving to be effective, and the likelihood of its being repealed or changed dramatically, regardless of who's in Congress, is very low.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.613
So I think there's security there.

26:55.593 --> 27:12.634
Now, we've had discussions of the third major area, things like a flat tax, a consumption tax, major changes in the tax system that could fundamentally change the advantages and disadvantages of using a 401k plan or a 403b plan.

27:13.595 --> 27:16.799
And we may see that type of change in the years ahead.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.643
It seems to be popular with the public.

27:19.623 --> 27:36.485
But one of the issues as we're thinking about people planning more, it's having individuals ask the question of what will the implications of those changes be for what I need to do in terms of my savings, what my employer may help me do or may do for me.

27:37.166 --> 27:42.373
So I agree with him that there's reason to be generally confident and upbeat.

27:42.353 --> 27:55.026
And it's principally because all politicians have parents, they have grandparents, they have children, and all politicians hope someday themselves, if need be, to retire in comfort and luxury.

27:55.847 --> 28:08.040
And so there's going to always be a great attention of our public officials to assuring that retirement programs are there and that retirement safety is there.

28:08.020 --> 28:17.770
I think there's one other message, though, and it's one that politicians today are probably, even with what some might think is negative conversation, helping.

28:18.411 --> 28:33.387
And that's the statements of the Democratic senators like Kerry or the Republican senators like Simpson, saying think about Social Security, think about what it will provide, focus on the future, think about whether or not inflation will be high or low.

28:33.367 --> 28:42.559
From our most recent surveys, only one-third of today's retired population says they plan for retirement before retiring.

28:43.501 --> 28:51.932
Only 28% of today's active workers say they've yet thought at all about whether or not they'll have enough money in retirement.

28:52.503 --> 28:55.386
And I think this message isn't a castor oil message.

28:55.447 --> 28:58.390
It's a message that says do something for yourself.

28:58.991 --> 29:06.961
Look out for your opportunity and look out, help yourself create the freedom to act and to retire when you want to.

29:07.661 --> 29:12.067
And the way to have that freedom is not to rely just on Social Security.

29:12.607 --> 29:15.591
It's not to wait for an employer to be paternalistic.

29:15.892 --> 29:21.940
It's to begin planning early, saving early, and saving even small dollars if they're very small.

29:22.501 --> 29:38.122
Because in this game, the ability to have some savings when you hit retirement versus no savings when you hit retirement is the difference between some comfort and sleeping while at night and worrying about, yes, how you're going to afford that castor oil.

29:39.403 --> 29:44.250
Dallas Salisbury, the president of Employee Benefit Research Institute, thank you for being with us on Primetime Radio.

29:44.470 --> 29:45.291
Wonderful to be here.

29:46.030 --> 29:49.715
And Secretary Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor, we thank you as well for being with us.

29:50.497 --> 29:50.997
Thank you, Mike.

29:52.019 --> 29:58.088
By the way, we hope we've proved our case today that education about retirement is very necessary.

29:58.128 --> 30:03.235
We mentioned a Labor Department brochure that may help you understand all of the issues much better.

30:03.616 --> 30:05.599
Here is the phone number for you to call.

30:05.759 --> 30:09.324
I'll mention it twice, 202-219-9247.

30:11.507 --> 30:13.270
That's area code 202-9247.

30:13.874 --> 30:14.816
219-9247.

30:17.862 --> 30:24.916
Particularly for that two-thirds of you who we just heard don't even think about retirement, it might be time to start thinking about it.

30:26.539 --> 30:32.130
Coming up, Barbara Seaman, one of the women who started the women's health movement as Primetime Radio continues.

30:32.151 --> 30:32.912
Stay tuned.

30:40.672 --> 30:52.673
Coming up, we meet the woman who challenged the pill and the whole medical establishment as well, as Primetime Radio continues.

31:11.283 --> 31:12.365
Hello, I'm Mike Cuthbert.

31:12.385 --> 31:14.429
Welcome back to Primetime Radio.

31:14.970 --> 31:20.119
You know, 25 years ago, few women's voices were raised against the imperious attitude of doctors toward them.

31:20.640 --> 31:29.997
Because of what happened to women like our guest in this edition of Primetime Radio, women began to say, whoa, to the medical establishment, and they began to ask pertinent questions about their care.

31:30.618 --> 31:35.046
Many in the establishment called them impertinent and resented the questioning of their authority.

31:35.026 --> 31:56.933
history however has tended to prove the women who took an active role in their own care correct they were reacting to centuries of medical assumptions that at one time looked at pregnancy in the female reproductive system as something apart from the rest of medicine just the other day i was looking at a book from the late nineteenth century called the theory and practice of midwifery as well as other diseases of women and children

31:56.980 --> 32:11.059
Now let's meet the co-founder of the National Women's Health Network, trustee of the National Council on Women's Health, and a woman who, with a few others, began to change the idea of women being pregnant as a disease, began to get women respect when they went in the doctor's office.

32:11.099 --> 32:12.260
Her name is Barbara Seaman.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.281
Barbara, it's good to see you.

32:13.462 --> 32:14.203
Boy, thank you very much.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.665
It's wonderful to meet you at last.

32:15.745 --> 32:17.487
It's always nice to meet a legend.

32:17.467 --> 32:18.809
Well, ditto.

32:19.650 --> 32:24.758
What was the level of public discussion of women's health matters in the 70s when you became active?

32:24.978 --> 32:26.541
We should point out you were not a nurse or anything.

32:26.561 --> 32:27.662
You were a journalist at the time.

32:27.682 --> 32:29.105
Journalist, yeah.

32:30.347 --> 32:35.795
We were drugged, shaved, humiliated, and stuck up in stirrups to deliver our children.

32:36.155 --> 32:42.906
And if we asked any questions, we were told, let doctor do the worrying for you.

32:43.106 --> 32:44.648
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.

32:45.449 --> 32:45.870
And the

32:46.137 --> 32:48.903
infamous, would I give you anything that would harm you?

32:50.487 --> 32:51.490
Yes.

32:51.510 --> 32:56.662
Well, what were the breakthrough moments of truth or the events that made you say, wait a minute, something's not right?

32:56.702 --> 32:57.203
Yeah, sure.

32:57.664 --> 33:01.092
You want me to tell the story of my baby son's famous

33:01.358 --> 33:02.460
indigestion.

33:03.762 --> 33:15.942
Well, in 1957, I gave birth to my first child in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I told my obstetrician that I planned to breastfeed, and he looked at me and he said, you wouldn't make a good cow.

33:17.604 --> 33:18.285
I said, why not?

33:18.305 --> 33:19.607
He said, well, you're too educated.

33:21.871 --> 33:25.156
So I said, I think I'd like to breastfeed anyway.

33:25.217 --> 33:27.400
My mother nursed me and my sisters, and

33:28.544 --> 33:29.085
I like it.

33:29.245 --> 33:29.905
I like the idea.

33:29.945 --> 33:34.810
So he shook his head no, and he thought his point of view settled it.

33:34.870 --> 33:36.111
I thought my point of view settled it.

33:37.233 --> 33:46.201
So when I gave birth to my son Noah, I was given these pills every four hours, and I wanted to know what was in them, and nobody would tell me.

33:46.342 --> 33:53.809
The nurses would stand over me and not go away until I took the pills, and they would say doctor's orders and stuff like that.

33:53.789 --> 33:55.210
And Noah got very sick.

33:55.270 --> 34:01.256
It turned out that among the postpartum medications I was given was a laxative that goes right into the breast milk.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.139
It causes terrible, terrible indigestion in the babies.

34:05.260 --> 34:09.904
And Noah, if it hadn't been discovered, I don't know whether he would have survived.

34:11.025 --> 34:22.075
So when my daughter was born a couple of years later, my first daughter in 1960, I managed to get a very subversive article sold to a small...

34:22.055 --> 34:28.742
magazine for new mothers called Mother's Manual and it was on how to breastfeed, how to subvert the breastfeeding practices in hospitals.

34:29.443 --> 34:33.648
And I told women how to palm the pills and wait till the nurses went away and then throw them out.

34:34.129 --> 34:47.083
And particularly I was very concerned about all the goo and ointments they gave you to put on your nipples because the nupricanol and alcohol and so on were not appealing to the baby and they really interfered with the baby learning how to nurse.

34:48.346 --> 34:49.468
This is getting a little graphic.

34:50.169 --> 34:50.389
I'm sorry.

34:50.409 --> 34:51.291
No, that's okay.

34:51.371 --> 34:52.292
This is what was done.

34:52.773 --> 34:59.584
You realize a lot of the women listening shared that experience, but a lot of the women listening can't believe what you're saying, that this actually went on.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.928
The ones who are my age, I'm 60.

35:02.008 --> 35:03.130
I just had my 60th birthday.

35:03.150 --> 35:06.355
The ones who are my age and my generation will probably remember this.

35:06.335 --> 35:08.097
And the younger ones probably won't believe it.

35:08.257 --> 35:13.882
And I hope they know that it's because of a few of us who rebelled that they're treated a little more respectfully now.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.306
I don't know what difference it really makes.

35:17.326 --> 35:19.708
I mean, we didn't do it because we wanted to get credit for it.

35:19.728 --> 35:23.452
But still, it would be nice if once in a while somebody said, gee, it's not as bad anymore.

35:24.333 --> 35:28.757
Anyhow, I published this very subversive article in Mother's Manual.

35:28.797 --> 35:29.838
And it was a small magazine.

35:29.858 --> 35:31.499
Maybe it had a circulation of 60,000.

35:31.519 --> 35:34.522
And we got over 2,000 letters.

35:35.003 --> 35:35.143
Mm-hmm.

35:35.579 --> 35:44.956
So it became clear to me that there were a lot of women out there who really, they were under a mask of compliance in the doctor's waiting room or in the hospital.

35:45.718 --> 35:52.230
They were really hungry for health information that was truthful and not patronizing.

35:52.851 --> 35:59.443
How did all this translate into your focus, which resulted in the now famous book, The Doctor's Case Against the Pill?

35:59.626 --> 36:02.092
which just was reissued in a 25th anniversary edition.

36:02.172 --> 36:03.475
As usual, it was the year late.

36:03.515 --> 36:11.593
It was published in 1969, and so the 25th anniversary edition of The Doctor's Case Against the Pillow should have come out in 19...

36:12.012 --> 36:13.014
94, right?

36:13.274 --> 36:13.675
Yes.

36:13.695 --> 36:16.901
I can do that edition.

36:16.921 --> 36:20.928
But I was adding new chapters on the pill at 35 and Norplant.

36:21.149 --> 36:26.398
And once you get into issues like that, the research always turns out to be much more complicated.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.422
It always turns out there's a lot that's being concealed.

36:29.985 --> 36:33.531
So it took me a whole year to do the new material.

36:33.511 --> 36:43.224
But what happened in the 60s was that, due to my experience with the laxative, I was very wary of any pills that doctors offered.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.512
So when the pill came out, I said, no thanks, I didn't want it.

36:47.264 --> 36:55.621
But due to my having turned to a career in medical reporting, by the middle 60s, I had three columns in women's magazines.

36:55.641 --> 36:57.285
I had my own column in the Ladies' Home Journal.

36:58.127 --> 37:04.640
I was writing a column with my physician husband in Brides' Magazine, and I was ghostwriting a column in Good Housekeeping for a Celebrity.

37:05.281 --> 37:08.007
So I was reaching about 18 or 20 million women a month.

37:07.987 --> 37:11.231
and part of my beat was the new birth control technology.

37:11.251 --> 37:15.918
That was the most important medical news of the 60s, the pill and the IUD.

37:16.338 --> 37:17.640
Boy, the pill was revolutionary.

37:17.660 --> 37:18.461
Do you remember how?

37:18.581 --> 37:18.922
Oh, sure.

37:18.942 --> 37:21.345
It was revolutionary not only for women but for men as well.

37:22.447 --> 37:23.528
More better for men.

37:23.788 --> 37:24.750
I think so, probably.

37:24.770 --> 37:27.554
On balance, yes.

37:27.574 --> 37:28.475
Now I haven't admitted that.

37:28.515 --> 37:29.516
Let's quickly move on.

37:31.259 --> 37:33.462
Yeah, the guys loved it, and why not?

37:34.082 --> 37:37.487
As it's turning out now, it was a terrible thing that they abandoned the condom, so...

37:38.294 --> 37:44.592
Eagerly because we've paid a big price for that with the rebounding of the sexually transmitted diseases now.

37:45.533 --> 37:48.518
But anyhow, by the way, the new condoms are much better.

37:48.638 --> 37:49.500
I just want to say that.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.022
It's really important for people to know that.

37:51.423 --> 37:57.353
There are new condoms that are treated with spermicides, and they're really very reliable.

37:57.613 --> 38:04.064
And also, there are a lot of different textures, sizes, shapes, and so on.

38:04.084 --> 38:04.946
So there's more of a choice.

38:04.986 --> 38:10.495
It's not as unpleasant a method as it was before.

38:10.475 --> 38:21.152
Well, if the condom is better, what's happened to the pill since your book, a lot more research on it, and the fact, let's face it, most women still apparently turn to the pill as their first choice for contraception.

38:21.172 --> 38:22.734
I'm not sure that's true anymore.

38:22.774 --> 38:34.693
It got very popular again in the late 80s after the FDA made the manufacturers take all the high-dose pills off the market, and then the pill companies were very smart with their campaign to say, oh, the pills now are...

38:35.281 --> 38:38.526
only one-tenth of the hormones that they used to have and they're perfectly safe.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.669
So for a few years the women came back to the pills.

38:41.531 --> 38:45.657
But now they're drifting off again for two reasons.

38:45.778 --> 38:53.129
One is they're really getting concerned about the sexually transmitted diseases and they know that it's important to return to the barriers if they possibly can.

38:53.890 --> 38:58.337
And the other reason is that the low-dose pills have their own problems, which I'll be glad to get to in a moment.

38:58.397 --> 39:01.322
But I did want to say, I didn't finish answering your question before,

39:01.302 --> 39:07.709
Because I had all these magazine columns, whenever I wrote something on the pill, I was deluged with reader inquiries.

39:08.230 --> 39:12.234
And often they would say, oh, I had that side effect, but my doctor said it couldn't be from the pill.

39:12.254 --> 39:13.296
It was all in my mind.

39:14.517 --> 39:19.022
And over and over, my readers would use a phrase like, I felt as if I was up against a brick wall.

39:20.003 --> 39:24.188
And some of the women were having side effects that were reversible.

39:25.062 --> 39:29.190
weight gain, bloating, depression, pregnancy symptoms.

39:29.772 --> 39:35.102
But some of them had terribly serious side effects, particularly blood clots and serious depressions.

39:36.245 --> 39:39.391
And I just felt more and more that a cover-up was taking place.

39:39.471 --> 39:45.383
And I found that there was information being published in the medical journals that was not getting to women.

39:46.544 --> 39:48.970
So I went to Columbia University Journalism School.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.253
I got a science writing fellowship.

39:50.313 --> 39:54.543
I took a lot of courses on how to tell a good scientific study from a bad one.

39:55.305 --> 39:57.650
And then I wrote The Doctor's Case Against the Pill, which came out in 1969.

39:58.192 --> 40:00.156
And I was writing it for my women's magazine readers.

40:00.377 --> 40:04.587
I just wanted them to have informed consent, to make up their own mind.

40:05.208 --> 40:15.362
I urged that the FDA require a patient package insert so that women could see, first of all, if they shouldn't take the pill at all, if they were in a high-risk group.

40:15.462 --> 40:21.310
I mean, any woman over 35 who smokes who takes the pill is almost asking for a heart attack, and that's still to some extent true.

40:22.331 --> 40:29.140
And also, if they started getting into trouble, they would know right away that it was from the pill because...

40:29.710 --> 40:32.054
Often women didn't associate their problems with the pill.

40:32.074 --> 40:44.697
If nobody told you that if you start coughing up blood and get chest pain, if nobody told you that that might be because you had a pulmonary embolism from the pill, you wouldn't think it was associated with the pill.

40:44.717 --> 40:47.702
So that was my obsession that women should be able to make up their own mind.

40:47.682 --> 41:13.251
our guest is barbara seaman's share her book is the doctor's uh barbara seaman why did i add an s the doctor's case against the pill and women's health worker she is as we mentioned co-founder of the national women's health network trustee of the national council of women's health and recently got involved in grandmothers for full disclosure why was that group necessary uh grant oh because i'm a grandmother and so are many of my friends and um

41:13.990 --> 41:18.175
When my older granddaughter, Sophia, was born, somebody said to me, how has that changed your life?

41:18.215 --> 41:22.199
And I said, I worry more about the ozone layer than I used to.

41:22.760 --> 41:41.061
And I feel that the generation that are parents now are so busy and stressed out with their many jobs that it's very hard for them to keep up with issues in health care and the environment and the food supply.

41:41.328 --> 41:45.334
that are really critical to the long-range health and welfare of their children.

41:46.235 --> 41:48.639
And some of the grandparent generation have a little more time.

41:49.660 --> 41:56.330
So we are trying to get the news out that people are entitled to have.

41:57.672 --> 42:09.610
For example, on the 35th anniversary of the birth control pill, the 35th birthday, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists had a big celebration.

42:09.630 --> 42:10.812
They even had a birthday cake.

42:11.753 --> 42:21.006
which I thought was a little ghoulish, because on the one hand, the pill has liberated many women, but on the other hand, other women have died, so it's not clearly something you have a birthday cake in.

42:21.487 --> 42:24.531
They had a birthday cake in the shape of a pill container.

42:25.653 --> 42:30.740
And then they started this educational campaign on the health benefits of the pill.

42:30.760 --> 42:39.853
And there was something phony about it, so I pushed very hard, and I did my little muckraking investigations, and I found out that this educational campaign...

42:40.306 --> 42:41.708
was not done with their own money.

42:42.069 --> 42:46.317
It was done with an educational grant from Ortho, which is the largest pill manufacturer.

42:47.158 --> 42:49.482
And I got a little critical about it.

42:49.542 --> 42:58.618
I said, well, then you should tell the reporters and you should tell the public that this campaign is being financed by the world's largest pill manufacturer.

42:59.358 --> 43:07.866
And they said to me, oh, no, it's all right because it's an unrestricted educational grant, and we're not mentioning brand names, so we don't have to tell the public.

43:08.346 --> 43:09.207
Now, that's ridiculous.

43:09.227 --> 43:12.790
When it's the largest pill manufacturer, you don't have to mention brand names.

43:13.411 --> 43:21.598
If pill sales increase, there's a 40% or 50% chance that the product that the new user is going to be buying is an ortho product.

43:22.118 --> 43:28.504
And the same thing, by the way, Eli Lilly does the same thing with Mental Health Day and its antidepressant.

43:28.940 --> 43:36.064
It gives a lot of money to the psychiatric organizations to promote essentially the use of Prozac without

43:37.377 --> 43:42.144
anyone ever telling the public that this is funded by a special interest group.

43:42.164 --> 43:51.819
Several weeks ago in this program, we heard from the FDA, going to disclosure, that they are being much more aggressive in requiring disclosure of side effects, particularly in the area of prescription drugs.

43:51.839 --> 43:56.386
And we had a member of the Center for Science and the Public Interest sitting here who agreed they were doing better.

43:56.907 --> 44:00.432
How do you see the situation as a member of grandmothers for full disclosure?

44:00.412 --> 44:10.944
Well, I'm not only a member of, uh, founder of Grandma's Full Disclosure, but don't forget that I was the person who invented the idea of the, they're now called med guides, but they were first called patient package inserts.

44:10.964 --> 44:21.196
And they came about because, um, the, when the doctor's case against the pill first came out, it persuaded Senator Gaylord Nelson to hold hearings on whether women were being informed.

44:22.297 --> 44:22.858
And, uh,

44:24.087 --> 44:34.038
And we kept pushing and pushing, and finally on the last day of the hearing, the FDA commissioner said he had decided that he would order a warning to be enclosed with the birth control pills, and that was the first.

44:34.058 --> 44:34.979
That set the precedent.

44:36.421 --> 44:39.244
My answer about how they're doing now is not well enough.

44:40.365 --> 44:48.314
Actually, I'm going to have lunch today with Dr. Lou Morris, who's the fellow at the FDA that's in charge of this whole program.

44:48.354 --> 44:49.555
Lou has worked very hard.

44:50.429 --> 44:54.415
But in the end, they always sort of waffle out of it, and they don't really make it mandatory.

44:55.216 --> 44:58.220
And here's what I think that your listeners can do, Mike.

44:59.281 --> 45:06.672
The fact is that the druggists used to say, and with some justice, they didn't want to have mandatory patient package inserts with everything.

45:06.932 --> 45:11.999
It was true that with the pill, it really reduced the deaths and serious injuries.

45:12.780 --> 45:18.428
But they said there just wasn't room on the drugstore shelves to handle all this paper.

45:18.948 --> 45:23.215
Well, with the advent of computers, that's completely changed.

45:23.235 --> 45:24.797
They can have programs in their computers.

45:24.817 --> 45:30.185
All they have to do is push a few buttons, and they can print out a piece of paper to give everybody who's having a prescription pill.

45:30.927 --> 45:44.668
But in this free-for-all environment where the FDA isn't regulating how much disclosure they have to give, what happens is that you can go into one drugstore, and you may find that the pharmacist has bought a program,

45:45.627 --> 45:54.597
which gives you risk assessment on the side effects as well as telling you whether to take it before or after meals and what other drugs not to take with it and everything else, where it's really comprehensive.

45:55.178 --> 45:58.042
And you can make up your own mind whether the risks are worth it to you.

45:59.483 --> 46:12.158
But other drugstores are buying very superficial inserts, that patient information labeling, that really only tell them how many times a day to take it and things like that.

46:12.880 --> 46:17.167
Don't even tell them what the danger signals are that they might be having a serious adverse reaction.

46:17.728 --> 46:30.090
So my urging to all your good listeners, and I know many of your listeners are the kinds of people who really do care about these kinds of things and establishing their own rights, is let your pharmacist know.

46:30.210 --> 46:32.173
Right now, that's one of the most important things you can do.

46:32.254 --> 46:37.723
Let your pharmacist know that you want to get a med guide or a patient package insert or labeling information.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.422
that really goes into details.

46:39.442 --> 46:45.031
You don't want to have to keep running to the library and looking up physician's desk reference or buying it every year.

46:45.071 --> 46:46.073
It's very expensive.

46:46.594 --> 46:49.959
You think you have the right to get it with your prescription being filled.

46:50.059 --> 47:00.235
And also, if you care to, write to the FDA commissioner in support that you think patients are entitled to have full information, full disclosure about all prescription drugs.

47:00.215 --> 47:10.510
Mike, if they want to join Grandmothers for Full Disclosure or they want information about the National Women's Health Network, which is also working on this issue, how would they get in touch with me?

47:10.570 --> 47:15.197
They can simply get in touch with Primetime Radio, and we'll give them a number at the end of the program to do that.

47:15.237 --> 47:17.240
You'll leave us the information, and we'll get them in touch with you.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.001
Oh, bless you.

47:18.021 --> 47:18.802
That would be wonderful.

47:18.822 --> 47:19.423
Isn't that nice of us?

47:19.643 --> 47:22.948
Oh, well, you're good folks.

47:23.249 --> 47:29.597
You've touched on so many things that are fascinating, and I've got to hit this one because I heard a fascinating discussion just a few weeks ago.

47:29.617 --> 47:42.373
A female doctor, a woman doctor, was dealing with estrogen therapy, and she was using percentages, and in the interest of making women or allowing women to make up their own minds, she fell on the side of therapy.

47:42.813 --> 47:50.623
But she presented a very fair case, and she said, look, if the chances of you getting cancer are increased by 2%,

47:50.688 --> 47:52.110
By taking estrogen therapy.

47:52.530 --> 47:53.632
I believe these numbers are correct.

47:54.053 --> 47:57.737
The chances of avoiding osteoporosis are increased by 10%.

47:58.358 --> 47:59.680
How do you judge the trade-offs?

48:00.301 --> 48:10.154
Now, she said that the chances of cancer being lower than the chances of osteoporosis made her fall on the side of estrogen therapy because the estrogen therapy helped prevent osteoporosis.

48:10.695 --> 48:18.265
But how do you, as a woman, judge these trade-offs, and how can any woman, given these strange kinds of choices...

48:18.886 --> 48:36.043
In women and the crisis, excuse me, in the doctor's case against the pill, in my new chapter on the pill, I discuss the whole question of the estrogenization of American women and how it seems to have been a factor in the rising breast cancer rates, which are going up 2% a year.

48:36.884 --> 48:40.307
And not only that, but it's almost all in the estrogen-receptive cancers.

48:40.507 --> 48:48.555
There are two kinds of breast cancers, and it used to be that the preponderance of them were the ones that did not have estrogen receptors, but now there's this big increase.

48:49.109 --> 49:05.330
and nobody knows how much is from the pill, how much is from the menopause estrogens, how much is from the pesticides that have estrogenic effects, how much is from the estrogens in the environment, because for so many years the cattle and poultry all got estrogens, and they weren't degradable by their stomach acids.

49:05.350 --> 49:07.613
They got into the food chain and the water.

49:07.633 --> 49:13.341
A lot about this is always being published in England, as you know, but somehow the manufacturers keep it from getting much attention here.

49:14.082 --> 49:18.087
So my answer on the estrogen query for middle-aged women is that

49:18.488 --> 49:21.992
I believe that somebody is having really severe menopause.

49:22.332 --> 49:26.136
If I had had a really severe menopause, I wouldn't have objected to taking it for a few years.

49:26.677 --> 49:31.983
But once you get past five years, you are really, I believe, increasing your cancer risks.

49:32.003 --> 49:47.179
And the truth is that while more women in the last decades of life succumb to heart disease than anything else, and while more than a few have

49:47.969 --> 49:50.934
injuries from falls, hip fractures that turn out to be fatal.

49:51.555 --> 49:58.165
We're talking about 80s and 90s mostly here, maybe 70s also.

49:58.225 --> 50:02.392
But cancer is a killer of women in their prime.

50:03.313 --> 50:13.369
And so for the individual woman, she is likely to, if she gets cancer, she's more likely to lose more years out of her potential lifespan.

50:13.349 --> 50:24.049
So I think another thing that's very important was said by Dr. Graham Kolditz at Harvard, who's head of the nurses' study, the famous nurses' study that includes the study of estrogen.

50:24.069 --> 50:27.375
He says, well, for heart disease and osteoporosis, we know what to do.

50:28.064 --> 50:29.746
We know things we can do to prevent them.

50:29.766 --> 50:32.750
We know to have a low-fat diet, to have enough calcium in our diet.

50:32.770 --> 50:34.913
We know to get various kinds of exercise.

50:36.034 --> 50:38.898
But he said, we don't know what to do to prevent breast cancer.

50:39.759 --> 50:51.134
So why take something to prevent heart disease and osteoporosis that's going to increase your chances of cancer when there are other things you can do to prevent heart disease and osteoporosis?

50:51.154 --> 50:52.135
So that's where I fall.

50:52.155 --> 50:53.397
But of course...

50:53.377 --> 50:59.245
The decision is up to the individual woman, but she's got to be given the true facts and think about it very seriously.

50:59.285 --> 51:10.279
And when these doctors go around saying, oh, more women die from heart disease than from cancer, they're leaving out what we all know, which is that for middle-aged women, some weeks we're afraid to pick up the telephone.

51:10.299 --> 51:11.801
We're hearing about another friend with cancer.

51:12.182 --> 51:16.988
So I think the doctors are sort of making fools of themselves because they're not acknowledging.

51:17.677 --> 51:21.802
that the cancer is striking more women in their prime, or seems to be.

51:21.822 --> 51:23.484
We're almost out of time, Barbara Seaman.

51:24.185 --> 51:27.209
More women are in medicine than were in the 1970s.

51:27.430 --> 51:32.136
We are currently undergoing a national debate on the changing focus and nature of our health care system.

51:32.616 --> 51:38.864
As you look forward 10 years, what do you anticipate the new problems in women's health are going to be?

51:39.765 --> 51:40.106
Oh, wow.

51:40.186 --> 51:40.526
Very quickly.

51:42.128 --> 51:43.330
I think...

51:43.816 --> 51:52.088
They could go in any direction because technology is changing things so rapidly and the whole cutback in health care services is changing things so rapidly.

51:52.869 --> 52:00.481
It's impossible to predict, Mike, and that's why I think it's more important than ever for us to take charge of our own health care.

52:01.322 --> 52:13.620
And I do hope, for example, if any of my listeners are taking the pill or Norplant or have a daughter or granddaughter who does, I hope they will take a look at the new information in my book, The Doctor's Case Against the Pills.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.722
I'm sure you can get it at a library.

52:15.762 --> 52:17.464
If not, ask the library to order it.

52:17.484 --> 52:19.766
I'm not trying to sell a lot of books.

52:20.087 --> 52:20.627
Really not.

52:20.687 --> 52:22.249
I just want people.

52:22.289 --> 52:27.514
They're subject to so much propaganda from ortho and the other drug companies.

52:27.734 --> 52:29.937
We have, as I said, run out of time, unfortunately.

52:29.957 --> 52:35.482
We could talk with Barbara Seaman a lot, as she has lots to tell, both in terms of history and what's going on currently.

52:36.043 --> 52:40.588
Once again, her book, the 25th anniversary publication of The Doctor's Case Against the Pill, is out.

52:40.708 --> 52:43.050
We thank you very much for joining us on Primetime Radio.

52:43.030 --> 52:44.469
Oh, thank you very much.

52:44.834 --> 52:46.273
It was really a treat to be here.

52:47.063 --> 52:52.451
We'd like to hear your reactions to all or any of our primetime programs, and we've set up a toll-free number for your calls.

52:52.711 --> 52:53.332
It's 1-800-424-9343.

52:53.352 --> 52:57.098
That's 800-424-9343.

53:00.142 --> 53:04.248
Cassettes of any primetime radio programs can be ordered for $4 each at the same number.

53:04.929 --> 53:07.233
Primetime Radio is a production of AARP.

53:07.573 --> 53:10.317
The show is produced by John Myers and engineered by Brian Hemler.

53:10.678 --> 53:12.320
Our associate producer is Janelle Haskell.

53:12.581 --> 53:13.782
I'm Mike Cuthbert in Washington.

53:13.963 --> 53:14.944
See you again next week.

53:25.792 --> 53:32.101
The thing about elder law I like the most is I'm not fighting with other lawyers.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.525
Lawyer and talk show host Len Tillem.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.448
Hello, I'm Jim Harriot with Mature Focus.

53:36.508 --> 53:38.190
Today, a look at elder law.

53:41.475 --> 53:44.199
Len Tillem is an attorney who specializes in elder law.

53:44.239 --> 53:49.948
He's also a nationally syndicated columnist on the subject and hosts a radio talk show in California about it.

53:49.968 --> 53:51.310
People come into your office and

53:52.032 --> 53:52.673
They're older.

53:52.753 --> 53:54.375
They seem to have their lives together.

53:54.395 --> 53:55.156
They're organized.

53:55.296 --> 54:00.143
And even though you're talking about who gets their stuff after they die, they're not upset.

54:00.563 --> 54:02.005
You know, there's a peace about it.

54:02.366 --> 54:06.691
Len counts that as one of the most important things he helps do, keep peace in the family.

54:06.711 --> 54:13.560
The main things that elder law deals with is the first thing is trusts and estates or who gets my stuff when I die.

54:13.620 --> 54:19.388
And another important issue is medic, we call it here in California, Medi-Cal planning.

54:19.408 --> 54:21.010
In the rest of the country, it's Medicaid.

54:21.175 --> 54:25.341
He says if grandpa or grandma has to go into a nursing home, what's going to happen to all the money?

54:25.821 --> 54:28.405
California, a nursing home is $3,500 a month.

54:28.505 --> 54:30.988
In New York, I hear it's about $5,500 a month.

54:32.009 --> 54:36.656
And I don't care how rich you are, if somebody winds up in a nursing home, after a while they're going to be broke.

54:37.156 --> 54:39.580
People clearly need Medicaid to help pay their bills.

54:40.040 --> 54:45.968
We help people transfer assets to qualify for Medi-Cal or Medicaid sooner rather than later.

54:46.117 --> 54:48.659
Then there's the difference between a will and a living trust.

54:48.980 --> 54:51.122
Len says a will is a letter to the judge.

54:51.522 --> 54:52.583
And you know what the letter says?

54:52.843 --> 54:54.725
The letter says, Dear Judge, I'm dead.

54:54.986 --> 54:56.667
This is what I want you to do with my stuff.

54:57.128 --> 55:02.493
But that involves probate, which in California, for example, can take a year and a half and cost several thousand in fees.

55:02.893 --> 55:05.896
To avoid that, you can set up a revocable living trust.

55:05.916 --> 55:07.077
Think of it as a corporation.

55:07.478 --> 55:11.081
And the way they work is you give your house to the trust.

55:11.281 --> 55:15.145
In other words, Bill and Mary Smith will sign a deed saying,

55:15.293 --> 55:20.381
that we, Bill and Mary Smith, give our house to the Bill and Mary Smith Trust.

55:20.401 --> 55:24.847
What that means is after they die, the trust, think of the trust as a corporation.

55:25.228 --> 55:28.052
You know, when Walt Disney died, Disneyland State opened.

55:28.553 --> 55:31.417
When Lee Iacocca left Chrysler, they still made cars.

55:31.778 --> 55:44.136
Well, when mom and dad die, the trust names as successor trustees, new managers, the kids, and the kids take the house out of the trust because the trust owns the house and gives it to themselves as

55:44.723 --> 55:45.945
beneficiaries.

55:45.965 --> 55:46.506
And that's it.

55:47.047 --> 55:48.509
Glenn Tillem has this advice.

55:49.030 --> 55:50.632
Be suspicious, folks, out there.

55:50.712 --> 55:59.726
If you have a lawyer who says to you, you don't need a trust, you're not rich enough, you only have $300,000, my advice is start looking for another lawyer.

56:00.106 --> 56:02.370
Probate used to be known as lawyers' social security.

56:02.570 --> 56:06.316
Now, it should be said, a living trust does not protect assets from being sued.

56:06.336 --> 56:11.964
But Glenn says, despite what we see in those movies and TV shows, most people are not sued.

56:11.984 --> 56:13.887
The most dangerous thing people do

56:14.255 --> 56:19.363
is drive a car and own a home because the mailman could get bitten by your dog or slip on some ice.

56:20.024 --> 56:29.639
If you have homeowner's insurance, if you have automobile insurance, I'm not crazy about insurance companies, but when you get sued, they do a good job protecting you.

56:29.659 --> 56:30.841
And that's what you have insurance for.

56:31.142 --> 56:37.191
Just ahead, some advice about money for the grandchildren and one of the most frequently asked questions by listeners to Len's talk show.

56:39.415 --> 56:54.719
Elder law specialist and attorney Len Tillem says you should give money to younger grandchildren in a trust controlled by the grandkids' parents, your children.

56:55.060 --> 57:01.029
Please don't get offended, but when it comes to money, your grandchild is as dumb as a rock at 18.

57:01.470 --> 57:05.777
I mean, you give an 18-year-old $10,000, he's going to decide, gee, it's a good idea.

57:05.977 --> 57:10.243
to buy a ninja motorcycle so I can discover America and myself.

57:10.664 --> 57:11.745
Don't give it to the grandkids.

57:11.785 --> 57:12.046
Give it.

57:12.506 --> 57:21.519
Give money to your grandchildren in a trust that your children or the grandkids' parents can hold to them and sprinkle on them, give to them as they need it.

57:21.779 --> 57:23.462
But it's not just a problem with youngsters.

57:23.482 --> 57:26.586
He says of all the questions asked him by listeners to his talk show.

57:27.107 --> 57:33.275
The biggest one that everybody asks is, my son-in-law is going to buy a Lexus with my money after I die.

57:33.375 --> 57:34.918
He doesn't know the value of a dollar.

57:35.138 --> 57:35.899
How do I stop that?

57:36.250 --> 57:42.681
And elder law specialist Len Tillam says one of the biggest things to remember is not to worry about it, that things have a way of sorting themselves out.

57:43.142 --> 57:44.705
As a matter of fact, he has a theory.

57:45.066 --> 57:49.714
After you die, your perspective on what your children do with your money will change radically.

57:50.335 --> 57:51.477
Of course, it's just a theory.

57:51.918 --> 57:57.548
So far, no one's come back to prove it one way or another.

57:57.568 --> 57:57.668
Music

57:57.985 --> 58:06.254
That's the weekend edition of Mature Focus, a production of AARP, brought to you in part by Buick, the new symbol for quality in America.

58:06.756 --> 58:09.345
Until next time, I'm Jim Harriet in Washington.
