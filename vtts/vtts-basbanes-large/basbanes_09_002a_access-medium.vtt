WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:04.953
Test, test, test.

00:04.973 --> 00:18.651
While we're talking to Mr. John Richardson, the author of what everybody is saying, I mean, they're comparing this with Ellman's Joyce and the great biography of Goethe, and that's pretty heavy company.

00:18.671 --> 00:19.052
I know.

00:19.112 --> 00:20.954
I mean, nobody was more surprised than me.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.678
I was absolutely delighted by this.

00:23.698 --> 00:29.025
I guess what it strikes out for me as a professional reader, I guess, is

00:29.512 --> 00:31.754
your concept of what a biography is.

00:31.894 --> 00:39.602
I mean, obviously it's more than the life, and it's the work, and you're not afraid to bring in gossip where necessary, but it seems to have to have a pertinence.

00:40.303 --> 00:45.929
Maybe if you could just address yourself to what your perception of biography is.

00:45.949 --> 00:49.832
Well, I think one's perception of biography changes according to the subject.

00:49.913 --> 00:54.858
I mean, you're not going to approach the biography of Braque in the same way as you're going to approach the biography of Picasso.

00:55.558 --> 00:59.282
Braque's case, you could write about Braque

00:59.448 --> 01:05.315
without really referring to his life at all, apart from his war wound in the First World War.

01:05.936 --> 01:07.437
And that's about it.

01:08.639 --> 01:12.764
And you could write a very illuminating work about him.

01:13.164 --> 01:25.038
Picasso, the work and the life are so enmeshed that you can't really, to my mind, understand the one without constant reference to the other.

01:25.879 --> 01:28.122
And especially right at the end when the...

01:28.388 --> 01:50.160
creative process and the procreative process become so enmeshed and as he becomes impotent he leads a kind of sexual life in his work and the painter who's presumably himself is painting a nude but he's actually sort of tickling the nipples of the nude with his brush

01:50.528 --> 02:16.232
and um so it's all totally i can get this quote in my feet but it's so enmeshed the whole thing so um i i don't have any specific biographical approach um in general but i have a very specific biographical approach to picasso and um which is to do with this um um

02:18.068 --> 02:27.224
the way his life and his work are, you have to understand the one to know it, to understand the other.

02:28.125 --> 02:32.332
So, to really understand the work, in your view, one must understand the light.

02:32.653 --> 02:38.383
I therefore assume that you're constantly being surprised by what you learn, as well as you know the work.

02:39.725 --> 02:41.007
I'm constantly being surprised.

02:41.448 --> 02:42.810
No, you absolutely did, right.

02:43.010 --> 02:46.514
And also, surprised by... I should have read a question.

02:46.634 --> 02:54.342
But surprised by these always even greater than I'd imagined.

02:54.362 --> 02:59.787
I mean, it's more complex, it's more interesting, it's more imaginative, it's more original.

03:00.508 --> 03:03.471
And you suddenly find a whole lot of drawings which you've never really looked into before.

03:03.491 --> 03:08.996
And when you look into them, I mean, they just are extraordinary.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.859
Oh, there, thank you.

03:11.879 --> 03:12.460
Oh, great, thank you.

03:14.971 --> 03:22.198
Thank you very much.

03:22.218 --> 03:39.454
And then I have to cite all people, critics who, semiologists and others, who see biography as not being respectable and that you have to see an artist's work completely without reference to anything else.

03:39.894 --> 03:43.257
Biographical details are of no importance, no interest.

03:43.777 --> 04:10.999
and um uh i think that's ridiculous well i think it's absolute rubbish but especially in picasso's case i mean i think that as i say i know there's a whole essence of new criticism yeah and you know that you totally separate the life from the work yeah and you know you just read the text is all yeah how can you possibly understand the text without no i mean i don't know yes above all with with um i don't know a writer like

04:11.452 --> 04:14.096
Hemingway, I mean, you've got to understand his life, it seems to me.

04:14.116 --> 04:25.152
I mean, I can see that there are certain poets who you could see in isolation from their life, but Babo Picasso you cannot see, but it doesn't stop the semiologists getting after me.

04:25.232 --> 04:34.605
Is it fair to call this an autobiographical form of art then?

04:35.126 --> 04:36.247
The art that he produces?

04:36.408 --> 04:38.050
Yes, well, he always said,

04:38.468 --> 04:44.257
that my work is like a diary, which is exactly what you're saying.

04:44.298 --> 04:54.735
And I used to see a lot of Picasso really roughly in the 50s, but I used to go on seeing him into the 60s.

04:55.616 --> 05:02.367
And his wife would cook a dish of eels for him for lunch one day,

05:02.617 --> 05:04.740
and you'd see a painting of Eels the following day.

05:04.780 --> 05:08.364
I mean, this is a rather simplistic image, but... It's quite telling, actually.

05:08.384 --> 05:23.802
But, I mean, it was so... It's sort of... I mean, this pattern repeats itself again and again and again, except that Picasso liked to see himself as a prophet.

05:24.803 --> 05:30.430
And I arrived at the studio one day, and there was an ink wash

05:31.102 --> 05:32.563
a painting of Jacqueline, his wife.

05:33.244 --> 05:43.873
And on the back, big black image, and the back of it was like fever chart lines, and sort of a terrible fever chart, pink, you know, and yellow and so on, zigzag, zigzag, all over the background.

05:44.554 --> 05:47.716
And he said, look, I'm a prophet.

05:47.796 --> 05:55.103
I mean, I did this painting of Jacqueline, drawing of Jacqueline, and three days later, she had a temperature of heaven knows what.

05:55.823 --> 06:00.147
And I didn't like to say, well, she's a very susceptible woman,

06:00.481 --> 06:08.711
And if you paint her as if she's having a fever, she's going to obediently get a fever.

06:08.731 --> 06:10.713
And so there's that aspect.

06:10.853 --> 06:15.439
Picasso saw art as having a magic function.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.525
And he could control people through his work.

06:20.545 --> 06:22.527
He could seduce women through his work.

06:22.547 --> 06:24.169
He could get rid of women through his work.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.472
He could, if he wanted, show

06:26.890 --> 06:49.708
his current mistress that there was another one by starting bringing them you know the images of her becoming i don't know brunette one side blonde the other and um yes no i mean yes i mean and um and as he himself said with a certain satisfaction it must be terrible for a woman to

06:57.181 --> 07:04.128
Certainly you knew so much about the man and his art when you started.

07:04.468 --> 07:10.934
Did you feel that you had a concept of what this biography was going to be?

07:10.954 --> 07:11.014
No.

07:11.034 --> 07:14.037
Or has it just been an adventure as much as it is for the reader?

07:15.258 --> 07:15.539
Yeah.

07:15.659 --> 07:25.168
I mean, I just wanted to tell the story the way it was and to impose no particular theories on it.

07:25.228 --> 07:26.209
I mean, I just wanted...

07:26.577 --> 07:29.721
and just to see what happened, you know, the moment I got into it.

07:29.801 --> 07:39.713
And somehow, as I'd known him well, or at an old age, I knew what it must have been like when he was much younger.

07:42.536 --> 07:46.120
But I can never get too far ahead of myself.

07:46.140 --> 07:55.251
I mean, it was no good even having research, doing research ahead of myself, because it's so dense and so complex that I just, you know,

07:55.872 --> 08:01.079
August 1912, I had to stick there and then go on to September and so on.

08:01.760 --> 08:05.446
But when you're writing now, you did a key decade here.

08:06.367 --> 08:07.849
Have you seen the life whole?

08:08.009 --> 08:13.737
I mean, you have the four volumes in mind here, or are you really just kind of researching these segments?

08:14.238 --> 08:17.603
Well, I'm just forging ahead, you know, and slowly, you know.

08:17.763 --> 08:25.474
In terms of interpreting now when you're writing a volume, though, you still don't see the life whole, do you, at this particular point, or do you?

08:26.180 --> 08:36.749
Yeah, I mean, having, especially as I knew him at the end of his life, I mean, I can see I'm heading towards that time, and everything's coming together all the time.

08:37.209 --> 08:56.085
And, I mean, there are surprises, as I said, in the quality of the work and the imaginative power of the work, but there are not really many surprises when, I mean, when I unearth something completely new, I think, oh my God, you know, this fits, this bit of the puzzle fits in so well.

08:56.487 --> 09:10.166
And I think intuitively I know what I'm... I don't want to impose any pattern, any theoretical pattern on his life.

09:10.246 --> 09:25.448
I mean, I just want to... And it just comes together in some... As a biography, I can honestly think of no other that contains so many illustrations where the visual record is just so much part of the text.

09:26.221 --> 09:28.725
I think in terms of biographies in general.

09:28.805 --> 09:45.972
At first glance, people who know nothing about this might think it's an art book, which it is, but this is really... Well, the text is paramount here, of course, but the illustrations... But also the illustrations are small, and they're not particularly beautiful.

09:45.992 --> 09:48.516
And they're duotone, they're not colour.

09:48.698 --> 09:56.349
But, I mean, they're ready to, like a lecture, you know, that the slides sort of, you know, keep you... It accompanies the text, so to speak.

09:57.030 --> 10:01.096
And I get furious when people write and say, why the hell didn't you have any colour plates?

10:01.917 --> 10:06.924
And A, the book would be twice, three times expensive, and also it would become something else.

10:06.964 --> 10:09.668
It would become an art book, as opposed to a biography.

10:09.688 --> 10:13.013
I mean, I want to keep it as a biography.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.777
And that is the point, the colour plates is something else again.

10:15.877 --> 10:16.798
Any number of...

10:16.913 --> 10:25.671
Art books on Picasso where one can go to get the reproductions of the... And I don't want to be a... Bobo, I don't want it to be a coffee table book.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.677
You know, the people flip through the nice kind of illustrations.

10:28.717 --> 10:31.443
I want it to be a biography.

10:32.505 --> 10:36.593
Did you... Apparently this began as a two-blogging project, isn't it, right?

10:37.012 --> 10:40.577
So it had to be better.

10:40.597 --> 10:45.624
By the time I was sort of a quarter of the way through the first volume, I was going to have to be a fourth volume.

10:46.064 --> 10:55.217
Somehow the life imposed a certain speed, a certain, actually not speed, a certain slowness on me.

10:55.257 --> 10:57.520
And I just couldn't do it any other way.

10:57.580 --> 11:02.928
I mean, I just had... I was comfortable at this sort of rather slow pace.

11:03.889 --> 11:04.690
And...

11:05.699 --> 11:07.462
I couldn't do it any quicker.

11:07.482 --> 11:09.625
I couldn't do it any shorter.

11:09.645 --> 11:21.083
And if this was going to be a one-volume condensed version of four volumes, somebody else is going to have to do it because I couldn't ever do it.

11:21.103 --> 11:24.989
They did that to Leonie Dell's Henry James.

11:25.871 --> 11:28.815
They did it.

11:29.697 --> 11:31.099
Wasn't Carlos Baker's

11:31.771 --> 11:33.873
The biography of Henry Waite?

11:33.993 --> 11:38.178
No, but Blatner's biography of Prockner was two volumes, I think.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.479
So, I mean, it's done.

11:40.180 --> 11:43.663
But you're willing, certainly, to allow someone else.

11:43.743 --> 11:47.227
Do you have a timetable for this?

11:47.487 --> 11:49.810
I have, but I don't keep to it.

11:51.452 --> 11:55.716
I mean, I'm 72, and the first one took six years.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.997
The second one took five years.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.639
With any luck, the next one will take four years.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.267
It's only like the fourth one will take three years.

12:01.307 --> 12:04.030
But I don't know if this is measurably larger than volume one.

12:04.931 --> 12:09.036
No, yeah, not a... Oh, it's a little happier.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.137
It is a little happier.

12:10.638 --> 12:11.338
It's fine with me.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.320
I love big books.

12:13.221 --> 12:14.242
My own book is 638 pages.

12:14.382 --> 12:29.098
I'm... I mean, the next volume is going to be... I mean, the classical period and surrealism, and then political involvement, and...

12:30.597 --> 12:32.760
And also, he becomes a poet.

12:33.942 --> 12:38.829
And the poetry, I mean, it's fascinating.

12:38.949 --> 12:44.758
And this Lydia Gassman, whose name I gave you, is the great authority on Picasso's poetry.

12:44.778 --> 12:55.574
How so much of the material, the source material that you have consulted, has been totally unexamined prior to the development, I think, isn't that right?

12:55.674 --> 12:57.617
Yeah, I was lucky in one way.

12:57.637 --> 12:59.980
I mean, everybody said there are so many other biographies.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.294
Why do another?

13:01.334 --> 13:07.340
There hadn't been a serious biography since Picasso died.

13:08.081 --> 13:13.866
So I could say a whole lot of things which other people couldn't say, especially if you were a friend or close to him.

13:14.347 --> 13:20.132
I mean, Roland Penrose's pioneer biography is excellent, but he was such a friend of Picasso's.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.915
It suffers from a total lack of shadows.

13:22.935 --> 13:28.060
I mean, it's a great breakthrough book, but it's

13:28.377 --> 13:36.227
You know, I could put in the shadows, and I could put in the details, and I think see him more dispassionately.

13:36.307 --> 13:44.758
And I loved him, but I'm not blinded by this to his many faults.

13:45.580 --> 13:47.322
Of course, he's dead now, what, 23 years?

13:47.742 --> 13:48.203
Yeah.

13:48.223 --> 13:52.609
And so distance helps a little bit, too, doesn't it?

13:52.629 --> 13:52.949
Yes.

13:54.151 --> 13:55.793
And how many terms of it?

13:55.813 --> 13:56.594
Lord, yes, yeah.

13:56.674 --> 13:57.355
I would think so.

13:58.465 --> 14:00.767
And also more stuff comes out.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.709
The reputation continues to grow.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.451
Would you agree with that?

14:04.631 --> 14:06.513
I think so, yeah.

14:06.533 --> 14:07.214
Very much so.

14:08.455 --> 14:12.098
I mean, there was a dip just around the time he died.

14:12.138 --> 14:18.344
And then it sort of, very recently, it's just taken off and it's much... How do you explain that?

14:19.566 --> 14:21.087
I think that often happens, doesn't it?

14:21.187 --> 14:22.749
I mean, he'd lived so long.

14:22.769 --> 14:25.131
I think people, you know, thought...

14:25.634 --> 14:27.616
that the late work is very difficult to take.

14:27.676 --> 14:39.927
It was very, I mean, it could be seen as being clumsy and, yeah, and too quick, and as if he was sort of racing death, you know, in this race with death.

14:39.987 --> 14:42.229
Explain the subtitle, The Painter of Modern Life.

14:43.270 --> 14:46.373
If you read the first chapter, it'll become, you'll see why.

14:46.413 --> 14:54.780
When I did come to write about the Demoiselle, I did it at the end, I mean, because I just couldn't climb Everest, you know.

14:55.098 --> 15:00.224
After you climbed Everest, you climbed Everest.

15:00.244 --> 15:08.112
So I then got back to the Demoiselle and I thought, how the hell am I going to find a new angle on the Demoiselle?

15:09.053 --> 15:10.715
Because it had been so written about.

15:11.416 --> 15:19.685
And then I remembered, I shared a house, well I knew Picasso well, I shared a house with a man called Douglas Cooper, who was a great collector of Cubist paintings.

15:19.705 --> 15:21.687
And Picasso used to come a lot to the house.

15:22.468 --> 15:24.430
And he's very generous, he usually used to come

15:24.595 --> 15:31.401
with a present of some kind, until he one day arrived with a kilo of caviar and said, you know, those drawings are getting so valuable.

15:31.421 --> 15:33.023
Here's a kilo of caviar.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.706
And he soon resumed giving drawings.

15:37.087 --> 15:43.633
Anyway, for Douglas's 48th birthday, he arrived with a drawing for the Demoiselle d'Avignon.

15:43.653 --> 15:50.819
And on the back was a drawing of Fernand in a kind of rather fashionable wasp-waisted outfit, which is holding up.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.742
You don't see from the drawing, but you know from other drawings, a parasol.

15:54.633 --> 16:00.419
And I asked Picasso whether there was any connection between the Demoiselle and this drawing.

16:01.421 --> 16:03.363
And he said, not really.

16:03.403 --> 16:15.176
The reason was, halfway through working on the Demoiselle, I put it aside because I wanted to do a composition of carriages in the Bois de Boulogne.

16:15.997 --> 16:17.058
And this was a sketch.

16:17.138 --> 16:22.564
There was going to be Fernand in the front with a parasol, carriages in the back.

16:22.882 --> 16:27.289
And there were two or three other drawings of carriages and so forth.

16:27.309 --> 16:30.314
And I started thinking about this, thinking, what the hell was he doing?

16:30.955 --> 16:34.821
Doing his... Yeah, Demoiselle, with a Bois de Boulogne carriages.

16:35.341 --> 16:39.869
And I thought, Constantin Guisse was the great painter of the Bois de Boulogne.

16:40.970 --> 16:43.895
And my God, Constantin Guisse was also a great painter of brothels.

16:45.557 --> 16:51.066
And, of course, there's a great Baudelaire essay called Le Peintre de la Vie Moderne.

16:51.603 --> 16:55.949
which is about Constantin Guise, but also applies very much to Manet.

16:56.770 --> 17:12.073
So I reread that, and the scales fell from my eyes, because Baudelaire, this was written, what, 60 years before the Demoiselle, Baudelaire describes this painting, the Demoiselle d'Avignon, which is done 60 years later.

17:12.814 --> 17:21.306
And there is this wonderful, wonderful description, which is in there, of how the greatest subject for a modern painter is either the whorehouse,

17:21.792 --> 17:29.861
or the carriages in the Bois de Boulogne, and that this is what the painter of modern life is going to do, that postulated these two subjects.

17:30.902 --> 17:50.162
And I suddenly realised that Picasso had... Oh, and then I found out that the pioneer book on Constantinople Guise had come out in 1905, that Picasso had done a drawing after one of the plates, and that in this pioneer book, a lot of Baudelaire's essay was quoted.

17:51.256 --> 18:01.329
And so suddenly I see Picasso, Picasso seeing himself as Baudelaire's painter of modern life.

18:01.349 --> 18:02.230
Wow.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.792
And which was a sort of revelation.

18:03.832 --> 18:09.600
And I thought this was so interesting that I called it the painter of modern life.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.462
And friends have said, well, it's a boring title.

18:11.502 --> 18:13.265
I mean, of course he was a painter of modern life.

18:13.585 --> 18:15.888
But that's what it was all about.

18:15.908 --> 18:16.609
Yeah.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.052
But to go back to your earlier observations,

18:19.285 --> 18:28.717
If you were to follow these rigid lines where you're not supposed to incorporate the life into the art, that wouldn't be relevant at all.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.461
But it's so relevant when you think about it.

18:32.481 --> 18:40.451
And also, people keep on talking about eros and finautos and all these other theories that it's about sexual trauma.

18:40.471 --> 18:41.853
It may well be about that.

18:42.254 --> 18:45.057
But this is a much greater...

18:45.374 --> 18:48.698
bigger interpretation because it allows for other interpretations.

18:48.778 --> 19:00.070
Even in Cuba's painting, he's very much, there are just false sorts of references to things, very contemporary, the right brothers.

19:00.090 --> 19:00.951
Yeah, oh yes.

19:00.971 --> 19:02.993
Contemporary songs.

19:03.013 --> 19:03.694
Yeah, yeah.

19:03.714 --> 19:04.635
So it fits.

19:05.095 --> 19:10.301
And no one, to my knowledge, has made this correlation ever before.

19:10.361 --> 19:11.382
No, I must say,

19:11.682 --> 19:17.030
Bill Rubin, who I was rather dreading what he was going to say because we're kind of rivals in a way, and I was treading on him.

19:17.050 --> 19:19.092
He regards the Demoiselle as his turp.

19:19.113 --> 19:20.394
Well, he and Steinberg.

19:20.735 --> 19:21.957
This is their turp.

19:22.197 --> 19:22.778
Keep off.

19:22.858 --> 19:26.223
Do you encounter much of that, you know?

19:26.243 --> 19:26.403
Oh, God.

19:26.423 --> 19:28.265
With Leo Steinberg, ooh.

19:28.506 --> 19:29.748
You're invading, you know.

19:29.788 --> 19:30.088
Yes.

19:32.852 --> 19:40.002
When I pointed out that the Demoiselle was the same size as the great, more or less the same size as the great El Greco,

19:40.370 --> 19:53.024
of the apocalypse in the Metropolitan Museum, and I found out that that painting was hanging in Zuluaga, a painter's studio, in Montmartre, when the Demoiselle was being painted.

19:53.484 --> 20:02.274
And because I had access to it, and the composition is very, very close to it, it's all in there too, Leo Steinberg was absolutely outraged.

20:02.294 --> 20:03.856
How dare I suggest this?

20:04.817 --> 20:07.660
Obviously, you're never worried of this subject.

20:07.977 --> 20:13.944
This is really going to occupy at least 20 years of your life.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.987
But you think about it, sure, easily.

20:16.007 --> 20:16.968
But you haven't weary of it.

20:17.749 --> 20:21.053
John is halfway through, though.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.135
I'm not wearying of the subject, but weary.

20:24.317 --> 20:25.538
How much time we got?

20:25.598 --> 20:27.020
A minute or two.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.403
All right, you better run them down.

20:29.423 --> 20:35.470
I guess just would you call it a sympathetic biography?

20:36.378 --> 20:37.599
You know what I'm saying?

20:37.639 --> 20:43.026
Well, I think it's... I mean, he certainly knew the man, and you had affection for him, I guess.

20:43.726 --> 20:43.826
Yeah.

20:43.846 --> 20:48.572
But I've tried to sort of see things in a certain detachment, and as you say, dispassionate.

20:49.193 --> 21:00.345
And I think I would see... At least the reviewers said... Well, no question, but I'm just wondering about, you know, you don't come to this with any... Well, what kind of baggage do you come to the project?

21:00.365 --> 21:01.947
Let's approach it...

21:02.551 --> 21:07.778
With, well, with... Predisposition, shall we say, as a point, maybe that's a better word.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.761
Well, I mean, a passion for the painting.

21:09.941 --> 21:15.028
I mean, I have a total, total passion for the painting, and I totally agree with... And that's essential, I think.

21:15.048 --> 21:20.855
Yeah, and Picasso used to say, well, said to me anyway, there's no such thing as a bad Picasso.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.097
Some are less good than others.

21:22.618 --> 21:24.680
And I totally go along with that.

21:24.901 --> 21:25.421
He said that?

21:25.521 --> 21:26.383
Yes, yes.

21:27.925 --> 21:30.448
Lack of ego was not his fulfilling, was it at all?

21:30.817 --> 21:31.338
No.

21:31.398 --> 21:33.540
But he's also capable of great modesty.

21:33.981 --> 21:34.902
Yeah.

21:35.382 --> 21:40.148
The difficulty is whatever you say about Picasso, the opposite is also true.

21:40.548 --> 21:41.309
Which is wonderful.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.712
Yeah, but it makes it difficult for the biographer.

21:43.952 --> 21:48.137
And then just your attitude, your position on the use of gossip.

21:49.459 --> 21:49.819
Very important.

21:49.839 --> 21:50.800
You use it, and it's wonderful.

21:51.221 --> 21:54.985
But tell me, did you set up any rules about where it applies and where it doesn't?

21:55.025 --> 21:57.668
It was everything fair game, everything grist for themselves.

21:58.272 --> 22:06.786
If I thought it illustrated a point or was relevant to the life of Barack or Picasso or cocktail, whatever it was.

22:06.886 --> 22:07.948
It definitely goes in.

22:08.168 --> 22:08.869
It goes in.

22:09.230 --> 22:13.376
And also if it was true, you know, if I could check it, double check it.

22:13.537 --> 22:20.828
I mean, or if it wasn't, if it was questionable, I'd say, I think I said, you know, so-and-so says this for what it's worth.

22:23.332 --> 22:24.955
But if it's a good story, it gets in.

22:25.188 --> 22:32.339
But what you've also done, for instance, in volume one... I quite agree with that.

22:32.359 --> 22:37.246
...is in a few instances taken him off his pedestal, though, the whole... Oh, God, yes.

22:37.366 --> 22:39.950
I mean, did you do me the honors before you go downstairs?

22:40.210 --> 22:41.192
Here's my card.

22:41.252 --> 22:48.242
The story about him in just a matter of a few hours from passing the entrance...

22:48.475 --> 22:51.119
drawing entrance exams for various.

22:51.319 --> 22:52.060
Now, I've got it.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.682
I'd like to use my academy.

22:53.822 --> 22:55.985
I missed your name, by the way.

22:56.185 --> 22:57.026
Oh, I'm Val Bordingham.

22:57.287 --> 22:57.667
Okay.

22:57.848 --> 23:03.996
Well, they're going to have quite a show here.

23:04.136 --> 23:06.339
A year from now.

23:06.459 --> 23:07.661
Are you going to be coming up, sir?

23:07.881 --> 23:09.103
Yeah, I certainly will.

23:12.087 --> 23:13.088
Well, I'm quite delighted.

23:13.789 --> 23:14.730
Oops.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.913
I've got another one, which I...

23:18.563 --> 23:21.666
I like, here we go.

23:21.686 --> 23:28.353
I think I might try to say that Picasso himself likes to sort of perpetuate this amendment of passing these exams very quickly.

23:28.373 --> 23:29.734
Yeah, well, Dr. Norton.

23:29.754 --> 23:33.778
Well, I'll say, he's just going to... And the deeded to him the full time.

23:33.798 --> 23:39.904
This is great.

23:43.327 --> 23:44.048
This is a...

23:45.192 --> 23:50.981
You saw the New York Times, of course, which declares this one of the truly great biographies.

23:51.402 --> 23:55.488
There were three things in the Times, actually.

23:55.548 --> 24:01.017
Yeah, but that full page in peace in the daily was just wonderful.

24:01.237 --> 24:05.123
That's great.

24:05.864 --> 24:07.667
Could you date it for me, too, sir, please?

24:08.027 --> 24:09.109
Yeah, what is it?

24:09.169 --> 24:09.750
It's 18.

24:09.770 --> 24:11.333
It's the week before Christmas.

24:13.456 --> 24:13.596
Great.
