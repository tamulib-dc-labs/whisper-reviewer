WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:07.290
We're talking to Mr. Peter Howard in Hadley, Massachusetts.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.632
What is it, today's the 7th?

00:09.652 --> 00:11.954
November, I guess.

00:11.974 --> 00:15.057
We have a number of things to talk about, Mr. Howard, I guess.

00:16.098 --> 00:21.402
And we've addressed a few of them on the phone.

00:21.422 --> 00:26.747
Where can I start?

00:26.767 --> 00:30.831
Well, I had wanted to talk to you, but Mr.

00:31.182 --> 00:34.986
Larry McMurtry really urged me to talk to you.

00:35.227 --> 00:40.392
And you had indicated that you had some ideas about Larry McMurtry.

00:41.393 --> 00:42.555
Let's start generally with that.

00:43.456 --> 00:46.760
We were onto something pretty good on the telephone.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.821
I forget where that was.

00:48.842 --> 00:52.526
Maybe we can just start it and take it from there.

00:52.546 --> 00:58.793
Well, it was probably my fascination with bookselling as a career and a profession.

00:59.954 --> 01:28.780
invested in an individual, invested in the personality of an individual, because my attraction to the profession is almost entirely based upon my perception of how it satisfies emotional needs and how people relate to other people via book.

01:30.683 --> 01:44.076
Bill Larry is a particular example because he seems so much to be a writer, being a writer entirely aside for the moment.

01:44.096 --> 01:59.610
He's an extreme example of someone for whom getting the books seems to be the most important aspect of book selling.

02:00.367 --> 02:05.994
relating to the customer the least important.

02:06.014 --> 02:29.445
Although I don't see him less and less frequently, the fact that he seems to have very little concern for the customer is interesting to me because I believe that I'm completely the opposite, although every bookseller

02:30.337 --> 02:35.142
takes vast pleasure in chasing books down however and by whatever means.

02:39.667 --> 02:59.128
But given the variety of premises and how people relate to their customers and whether they meet them face to face and whether they follow up with them and then whether they in fact make it a career of following up with them, lives go in different directions.

03:00.796 --> 03:04.481
There's a vast difference in the input for booksellers.

03:04.541 --> 03:11.449
Almost every bookseller has the same experience of seeing the same books out in the world because they're all constantly looking into their stocks.

03:12.010 --> 03:25.126
There are very few booksellers who are of my generation, or certainly in modern literature, or who started modern literature, who only buy privately.

03:25.147 --> 03:26.348
That's an entire difference.

03:26.851 --> 03:28.012
You only buy privately?

03:28.032 --> 03:31.015
No, I indeed not, although more than I used to.

03:31.856 --> 03:44.048
It takes years to, unless you somehow determine that you're only going to buy privately, almost every bookseller starts by canvassing the rest of the book trade to one degree or another.

03:44.989 --> 03:55.879
And the booksellers are infinitely more mobile in my generation and since then before, when there wasn't

03:56.382 --> 04:13.060
flying all over the country, driving all over the country, telephoning all over the world, and now faxing all over the world with an infinity of book fairs to visit and to harvest or to explore.

04:14.421 --> 04:24.972
So I would think more than ever, bookstores, instead of having a bookstore on the corner and awaiting

04:27.213 --> 04:37.969
possibilities of acquiring books from people who might be in their own town, they are aggressively going out and finding books.

04:39.972 --> 04:42.636
McMurtry was always a great traveler for books.

04:43.418 --> 04:44.680
Do you think he's buying books himself?

04:45.962 --> 04:46.302
Yes.

04:47.075 --> 04:50.298
And the bookstore is a device, so to speak.

04:50.318 --> 04:53.041
Well, it's very much more complicated than that.

04:53.382 --> 05:01.110
He's always had a tremendous house full of books that reflected his given interest at a given moment, totally separate from his own store.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.953
Stores, four of them.

05:03.973 --> 05:04.233
Right.

05:05.194 --> 05:09.078
And then the multiplicity of stores didn't come from the longest time.

05:10.379 --> 05:13.943
His only...

05:17.078 --> 05:30.274
explanation to me for his stores was that the other stores were meant to be feeder stores for, in order to buy books so they could have them to sell out of Washington.

05:30.294 --> 05:42.529
I have a dear friend in Southern California who's the most talented book person in Southern California in need of a job, and when McMurtry mentioned once that he intended to open a bookstore in Orange County,

05:43.792 --> 05:47.217
I proposed my friend immediately, saying that he could not possibly do better.

05:47.257 --> 05:53.286
He was the most honest person I've ever met, and the most conscientious, and the most brilliant.

05:54.468 --> 06:01.458
And McMurtry immediately said that he certainly didn't want anybody with any talent running the bookstore and working for him.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.264
He wanted the opposite, and so that was the end of that conversation.

06:05.605 --> 06:07.507
Did you probe that position?

06:09.170 --> 06:10.592
I understood it.

06:11.922 --> 06:40.107
He also tries to keep people at arm's length who might penetrate his privacy as a writer and as an individual, so he doesn't want people who are interested in him too near him.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.992
which is entirely understandable.

06:43.012 --> 06:56.548
And there could not be anybody in literature who would not be interested in McMurtry because, of course, his books are widely collected and widely read, and no one writes more intelligently about modern women than he.

06:58.190 --> 07:01.654
So, in that regard, he simply is trying to protect himself.

07:01.674 --> 07:04.958
What did you think of his Cadillac Jack book?

07:04.978 --> 07:06.480
Well, I was extremely interested in Cadillac Jack.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.102
I think it's one of his worst written books.

07:10.816 --> 07:37.583
But I long ago came to the conclusion that the emotions of his central character, who, although a dealer not in books, evidenced a very strange collection of emotions

07:40.702 --> 08:09.679
would emphasize the tendencies one sees in any profession such as ours, and particularly in the book profession, of the person always looking for a bargain, a score, looking to impose his knowledge in order to get from somebody who possesses a book, an object of much greater value, and then

08:12.241 --> 08:20.771
selling it for the big profit, possibly to an unappreciative buyer.

08:25.596 --> 08:39.953
And it was a portion of an equation that everybody gets to experience one time or another, and of course the mistake was necessarily to attribute any portion of these

08:40.591 --> 08:48.162
ideas to McMurtry himself, but the fact was that I felt that the character in the book had no affection for his customers.

08:50.485 --> 08:52.068
Do you think that's a reflection of Larry?

08:52.388 --> 09:10.294
Well, I think, of course, it's a mistake to attribute that, but I didn't like the character.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.649
Is he based on a real guy, by the way?

09:13.130 --> 09:14.431
There are several people.

09:14.531 --> 09:22.681
He is one of the people said to be the sorcerer, a guy like Jack is Hallam Weber.

09:23.602 --> 09:26.646
How do we spell his name?

09:27.207 --> 09:29.209
H-A-L-L-A-M-W-E-B-B-E-R.

09:29.229 --> 09:29.830
Is he around?

09:30.110 --> 09:39.522
Hallam Weber is a marvelously curious book person in Washington, D.C., who is

09:39.704 --> 09:55.327
has been said by the former head of the Library of Congress to be the most industriously curious and library-hunting, research-hunting person he ever met with regard to material found and in need of research.

09:56.489 --> 09:57.911
Is this guy approachable?

09:58.692 --> 10:01.276
Oh, I think he probably is approachable.

10:01.356 --> 10:08.867
He has always been on the periphery of the organized bull trade in that for a long time he attempted to exploit the

10:08.948 --> 10:30.637
organized book trade without joining it, he would set up in a hotel room opposite or on top of any book fair, particularly ABAA book fairs, and then invite the dealers and the customers up to his room to buy books without participating, i.e.

10:30.717 --> 10:34.382
paying some of the fees, and enjoying some of the responsibilities of

10:35.797 --> 10:49.309
of the members of the ABAA, I actually had an occasion to all of us, I think, let him know how we felt about this.

10:49.449 --> 11:05.803
And at one point, he had driven all the way across the country, had a serious accident, came to my store, and I let him look around, and then when he attempted to penetrate, every book viewer has rooms behind rooms.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.879
and everyone knows that the good stuff is in the back.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.843
I allowed a towel of the back was not open to the public and he couldn't come back.

11:14.903 --> 11:20.769
It was something so rare that he knew I was treating him in an especially tall manner.

11:20.789 --> 11:28.035
And he actually broke down and cried when I informed him of what I thought of him and why I was doing this.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.016
What did you think of him?

11:29.036 --> 11:29.697
What did you tell him?

11:29.717 --> 11:36.263
Well, I told him that the manner in which he attempted to exploit the organized booksellers was...

11:37.036 --> 11:40.820
Is that how you said it, or were you more salty than that?

11:40.860 --> 11:42.662
I probably said it even more salty than that.

11:42.682 --> 11:44.944
I said it probably in a two-faced gentle way.

11:46.766 --> 11:51.750
He did really take it personally, because I enjoyed some respect for him.

11:51.770 --> 11:57.156
And he went away, and we became much closer subsequently.

11:57.236 --> 12:05.524
And I sold him some interesting things afterwards, and we had a much closer rapport after that.

12:06.230 --> 12:12.679
In fact, I think he certainly stopped that practice and had changed, but he was a man subject to serious changes anyway.

12:12.699 --> 12:16.684
He had, I believe, lost a daughter in a tragic accident as well.

12:17.645 --> 12:26.297
He'd been ill subsequently, and I believe he's even under a serious philosophical or religious conversion taboo.

12:27.518 --> 12:34.768
But he and Cadillac Jack had, and I'm certain that Mercury said that Cadillac Jack

12:36.200 --> 12:49.657
had parts of Alan Webber running, there was, again, this indisputable aspect that Alan Webber was a great getter of interesting items.

12:49.677 --> 12:53.362
Well, like Cadillac Jack, did he do other things in addition to books?

12:53.802 --> 12:55.705
Oh, I sold him a powder horn.

12:55.905 --> 13:01.572
Alan could be capable of being interested in objects of any sort, sure.

13:03.014 --> 13:03.895
Many booksellers.

13:04.786 --> 13:16.937
It took me 10 or 20 years before I started looking at the walls of places where I was invited, so that I would risk buying a print or a painting or a piece of art.

13:17.397 --> 13:28.748
Booksellers eventually learned to look at the walls or the floors, although their great pleasure is books, I think, without a doubt.

13:28.868 --> 13:31.831
Which library and baron of Congress made their comments?

13:31.851 --> 13:33.392
William Madison.

13:34.283 --> 13:36.406
former chief of the Air Book Division, Library of Congress.

13:36.426 --> 13:37.047
And where is he now?

13:37.488 --> 13:40.352
He's retired in Baltimore.

13:40.892 --> 13:42.415
He's one of Larry's old customers.

13:42.555 --> 13:49.665
Larry is said to have a lot of personal relationships with a lot of customers, and I'm presumptuous to say that, you know, I think he has fewer rather than more.

13:50.686 --> 13:52.929
He has this entire other life, of course, as a writer.

13:53.891 --> 13:55.533
Bill Matheson's certainly one of them.

13:55.553 --> 13:59.178
I've been told to contact him right away.

13:59.198 --> 14:01.101
He's readily reachable.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.652
And knowledgeable, I'm told.

14:03.672 --> 14:05.835
Oh, and very knowledgeable and very fastidious.

14:06.696 --> 14:26.763
Hallam was a classic example of the man out for, and very talented at doing it, out for an interesting item, which no matter what it cost, was susceptible to a substantial increase in price, and he undoubtedly did it many, many times.

14:27.524 --> 14:31.189
There's a whole class of booksellers or book people who

14:31.962 --> 14:33.003
can't do that.

14:34.464 --> 14:42.932
And of course they need to have a sufficiently persuasive personality to persuade somebody to buy it.

14:43.652 --> 14:53.000
But my guess is that they are not selling the things that they find over and over again to the same customers.

14:53.341 --> 15:00.467
One of their more serious motivations is the immediate

15:01.780 --> 15:04.984
Has Helen worked in the trunk of his car?

15:05.064 --> 15:08.648
He indeed works in the trunk of his car.

15:08.668 --> 15:12.993
Literally and figuratively and all-in-one he is.

15:14.555 --> 15:18.400
I think he more or less is almost retired from doing things like this.

15:18.420 --> 15:22.265
He's been involved in a lot of social work, I think.

15:22.285 --> 15:25.008
And he lives in Washington?

15:25.028 --> 15:27.531
Yes, he lives in the perimeter.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.412
I have a subject.

15:29.742 --> 15:31.524
He's worth my attention, in other words.

15:31.544 --> 15:33.146
Yes, he is indeed worth your attention.

15:33.727 --> 15:49.308
As a classic example of a self-made dealer, self-educated self-made dealer, I'm not sure what schooling he may have had, or he's a loner, a self-made man, and a self-motivator, and totally independent.

15:49.348 --> 15:54.855
He's well known for having cash in his cowboy boots, and a lot of it.

15:55.139 --> 16:12.607
I don't think he's a Texan, but he is an idiosyncratic and visible human being who would stand out amongst any group of buyers, a man of great confidence and a man of cash.

16:13.268 --> 16:21.602
There aren't, in these modern days of corporate finance, and there are many young booksellers who are incorporated, including myself,

16:22.544 --> 16:28.070
And bookkeepers and computers, he is completely different in that regard.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.213
I'm going to change subjects.

16:30.253 --> 16:34.778
I just want to make sure everything is awesome.

16:34.798 --> 16:43.548
Larry, in a letter to me, said, after having written Cadillac Jack, what more is declining to discuss his experiences as a bookseller?

16:43.568 --> 16:45.010
He doesn't want to talk about his experiences.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.932
Well, his experiences are very complex.

16:46.952 --> 16:50.256
And instead, let me just finish, he has sent me to other people.

16:50.557 --> 16:56.664
Not necessarily, I mean, I don't have to be a rocket scientist to know what the drill is.

16:56.764 --> 17:01.349
I mean, he suggested a few people that I talked to just to talk to.

17:01.549 --> 17:02.250
You know what I'm saying?

17:02.671 --> 17:06.835
I think you and I understand that's why we're starting with Larry McMurtry.

17:06.875 --> 17:11.040
I think that he's suggesting, I'm not going to talk to you about myself, but there are a few people perhaps.

17:11.060 --> 17:11.440
Who will.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.222
Who will, and Marcia is one.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.804
I mean, I didn't know about Marcia.

17:14.824 --> 17:15.585
She's wonderful.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.024
I had a pleasant day with her.

17:20.445 --> 17:23.148
I never was.

17:23.248 --> 17:29.696
I would drop in on Larry and he would have been there more frequently than now.

17:30.677 --> 17:44.593
So how much of a bookseller he is and how much of his emotional life is satisfied by being a bookseller I think is qualitatively different from any other bookseller since he has an entirely other life.

17:45.333 --> 17:50.720
That would be satisfactory for most people, but Larry was a bookseller at the beginning.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.924
And before he was Larry McMurtry.

17:54.064 --> 18:00.451
That's right, before he was a famous writer, or simply a writer whether famous or not, or successful or not.

18:01.092 --> 18:09.062
And I think Larry enjoyed as much success as any writer might reasonably have a hope for from the very beginning.

18:09.346 --> 18:16.836
It was only in the very end that he was qualitatively in the stratosphere in so many regards, particularly popularly.

18:17.737 --> 18:21.182
But bookselling is very hard to shake.

18:21.302 --> 18:38.425
And for Larry, the acquisition of books, it seems to me, clearly an enormous portion of the... provides the satisfaction...

18:39.029 --> 18:40.972
for an enormous portion of his book life.

18:41.372 --> 18:43.315
Do you think he's a dealer more than a seller?

18:43.555 --> 18:44.837
No, he's a buyer.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.618
He's a buyer.

18:45.678 --> 18:47.260
He lets the books take care of themselves.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.644
That's why he has Marsha and Ray and the others.

18:49.664 --> 18:57.675
Well, I mean, he had a romantic relationship with Marsha, and their professional relationship has persevered.

18:57.695 --> 19:02.041
The question is, how often is he in a store?

19:02.181 --> 19:03.162
I sense that, by the way.

19:03.182 --> 19:04.925
I didn't know that, but I sense that.

19:04.945 --> 19:08.209
I'm sure that you might find pieces of Marsha.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.812
read his books carefully enough looking for them.

19:10.872 --> 19:15.758
It's a terrible mistake to do with any writer, just a terrible crime against the people.

19:15.858 --> 19:19.382
I will keep this part off the record, by the way.

19:19.402 --> 19:21.064
And the books.

19:23.206 --> 19:38.483
But from my point of view, I'm interested in the degrees to which book people get satisfactions in their emotional lives in all aspects of

19:38.834 --> 19:39.936
being a book dealer.

19:41.057 --> 19:47.708
I often talk as if, you know, the way I feel about myself is the way everyone ought to be.

19:47.908 --> 19:49.571
Do you understand that?

19:49.591 --> 19:50.332
By the way, dealer?

19:50.753 --> 19:52.455
I know Colin Franklin corrected me.

19:52.696 --> 19:56.281
He said, I do not like to be called a book dealer.

19:56.301 --> 19:58.385
I suppose I have to accept it because I'm a bookseller.

19:59.266 --> 19:59.967
Fine.

19:59.987 --> 20:05.095
So I've been very... I see no need to be...

20:05.345 --> 20:08.490
petty or picky about the terminology.

20:08.610 --> 20:10.594
I mean, it's a noble profession.

20:11.054 --> 20:12.937
He used to be a banker, now he's a dealer.

20:14.480 --> 20:27.842
And he deals at the extreme point of the trade in the most fastidious manner with the least dubious or challengeable types of material, and he's very happy in it.

20:29.257 --> 20:39.213
And he deals in things that are terribly expensive, and he gets to think and feel and touch, you know, one million to one percent of what's out there.

20:39.273 --> 20:49.029
And I get to handle, you know, probably 10,000 times as many items as he has, some of them with as much knowledge about them as he has about his items.

20:49.109 --> 20:54.538
And so people are not to be compared in that way.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.284
Actually... But then again they are, because it's fun.

20:59.304 --> 21:01.387
Well, no, they're not, actually.

21:02.328 --> 21:03.970
They ought not to be, and it's a terrible mistake.

21:04.010 --> 21:06.252
I'm a very judgmental person.

21:06.272 --> 21:07.614
But they won't put me on track, then.

21:08.355 --> 21:24.593
Well, I was sitting next to him on the bus in the Japanese Tokyo Congress, and he was explaining to a Japanese bookseller that he had six or nine beehives, and that he did beekeeping,

21:24.742 --> 21:33.055
that the honey garnered there from, which he extracted himself, was made pleasant gifts for his friends on an annual basis.

21:33.155 --> 21:52.285
And I was reflecting how charming it is that a man should be able to spend time with his beehives, having just gone to the middle of Czechoslovakia and been with a scientist who was hosting us, from whom I bought a few books, who himself had a few beehives in his little garden cottage in the middle of nowhere.

21:53.378 --> 21:58.143
I said, well, that makes Colin even more of an agreeable person.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.245
Colin is an extremely agreeable person.

22:01.306 --> 22:09.435
He just doesn't choose to have an opportunity to derive as much pleasure from as many books and as many customers as some other person.

22:10.316 --> 22:13.379
We can make a transition.

22:14.580 --> 22:18.184
Unless there's anything more to add to this?

22:18.264 --> 22:22.288
No, it's just the habitual

22:22.707 --> 22:52.512
focusing on the nether ends of the book trade, the person who, for whatever reason, chooses to deal on a few items from a remote spot at his time and place and leisure, compared with someone who has a shop in the middle of downtown and who is haunted by either structural problems or negotiating problems or financial problems and who is feverishly attempting to acquire all the books in the world and then feverishly trying to sell them to every person in the world and the pain

22:52.660 --> 22:56.446
time maintaining personal life, raising children, and fixing his car.

22:56.706 --> 23:20.642
So the nice thing about the book trade is that anyone in it or penetrating it can go to either end of it in an instant and be totally welcome, and even as you seem to have done, the book trade has this tremendous range and in a range of people, and it is one of the

23:21.095 --> 23:34.309
few professions, I think, in which you can cross over at any time and be welcome, no matter who you are or how you look or what you do.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.251
This is the audience, by the way.

23:36.311 --> 23:41.077
This is the appeal of my book, as I hope to appeal to all of these.

23:41.097 --> 23:43.900
Now, this fellow, Weber, you think he'll be at the Boston Fair?

23:44.480 --> 23:44.720
No.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.064
So I shouldn't be alert to his presence.

23:48.938 --> 23:50.059
He could be.

23:50.119 --> 23:54.665
I don't think he... I think he really has turned away into... He's got a conversion.

23:55.406 --> 23:56.327
Literally a conversion.

23:56.427 --> 23:58.149
It's conceived I wouldn't be surprised there.

23:58.169 --> 24:02.794
He certainly would have been there a couple of years ago, but I think he's changed.

24:02.834 --> 24:03.895
Well, I think people describe him.

24:03.915 --> 24:05.938
There used to be a guy with a long ponytail.

24:05.958 --> 24:14.828
Well, he's got a long ponytail hair and cowboy boots and a large belly, a very large belly.

24:14.943 --> 24:19.548
He's a character, but he's not a fool.

24:21.810 --> 24:22.671
He's not a fool.

24:22.891 --> 24:29.278
He's a very, very curious man, and he's looking for things to be curious about.

24:29.318 --> 24:33.482
And people like that turn up interesting things.

24:34.783 --> 24:43.532
What they do with them and who they share their profits with is another matter, but they are constantly out there prowling.

24:44.272 --> 25:02.657
And the country is well proud of the questions and the people who come up with amazing, interesting things are not always the ones who are most successfully, the greatest financial beneficiaries of their labors.

25:02.717 --> 25:09.786
He happens to be the kind of person who insists upon the financial benefit of his labor.

25:10.267 --> 25:13.992
There are some who do not, or who are unsuccessful at it,

25:14.360 --> 25:16.102
And those are the saints of the book trade.

25:16.143 --> 25:17.084
There are very few of them.

25:17.124 --> 25:23.913
I've met two in my life, and they are, I habitually call them the greatest book scouts in the world.

25:23.994 --> 25:24.474
And they are?

25:24.875 --> 25:30.603
And in my terms and under my definitions of the range of activities and so on, they indeed are.

25:30.963 --> 25:31.444
And who are they?

25:31.724 --> 25:38.274
One is David Sachs in Oakland, California, and the other is Martin Stone of England, but now in Paris.

25:40.056 --> 25:40.697
And they're saints?

25:41.258 --> 25:41.939
They are saints.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.282
And they are saints because?

25:44.718 --> 25:48.102
They're saints because their primary motivation is not financial.

25:49.023 --> 25:53.628
And the books that they find are the most interesting and wonderful in the world.

25:54.810 --> 26:08.326
Immodesty aside, where would you place yourself in this wide spectrum that you have described for me, going from Hallam all the way up to Colin Franklin and some saints, either on the periphery?

26:08.346 --> 26:14.573
Well, I'm a worshipper at the shrine.

26:15.228 --> 26:24.537
And too, I'm a publicist.

26:26.139 --> 26:44.357
Well, I will bleak the character of the people I admire, obviously, in order to stand in their light in some instances.

26:45.147 --> 27:13.112
But I am also willing to go the extra step and keep the faith and make their products support them and support people like them and to get interested in things that they allow me to be interested in and extend the boundaries of, let's just say,

27:13.565 --> 27:23.155
my customers' knowledge in order to, or make available to a larger number of people that which I learned from those who touched me.

27:23.175 --> 27:37.851
One bookseller whom I quite like and who has certainly had a hard time of it, no, it was someone else, I can't remember, it'll come back to me, has said it was one of the few remarks that I actually had

27:38.101 --> 27:43.547
to give me for all my life that I was the least curious bookseller or person you'd ever met.

27:44.848 --> 27:50.034
And I took that to heart because I felt I understood where it was coming from and I believed it was true.

27:52.176 --> 27:56.620
And so I'm not sure that I've changed any since that time.

27:56.681 --> 27:57.441
I probably haven't.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.245
I haven't let that bother me.

28:01.265 --> 28:07.652
I've let it be a goad to

28:08.864 --> 28:14.132
to be at least receptive to everything that comes across my path.

28:14.212 --> 28:22.444
It almost really results in a tremendous superficiality, which I believe I make up for simply by dogged dumb and hard work.

28:24.167 --> 28:36.525
I've come to build around me a bookstore and a set of relationships.

28:36.860 --> 28:42.245
which will sustain me and from which I can represent the whole book trade.

28:44.607 --> 28:53.015
So I operate in a place and in a mental place, which I believe is very large and receptive.

28:55.437 --> 29:05.466
Are you, by the way, a person I should talk to if I'm trying to pitch a story as a preview or a review, one or the other, of the California Book Fair to a California newspaper?

29:06.323 --> 29:08.806
who would I talk to?

29:09.307 --> 29:10.088
For what purpose?

29:10.569 --> 29:11.430
To get information.

29:11.670 --> 29:12.171
About what?

29:12.551 --> 29:12.972
The fair.

29:13.393 --> 29:13.933
The fair.

29:14.574 --> 29:17.358
The one upcoming... What kind of information about the fair?

29:17.678 --> 29:18.880
Well, we'll talk about that.

29:19.781 --> 29:21.143
This doesn't have to be a take.

29:21.163 --> 29:22.966
No, I mean, you know, I don't mind.

29:23.046 --> 29:24.568
Well, I'm trying to... No, I'm just saying.

29:24.748 --> 29:25.970
This is not for my book.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.572
I'm trying to pitch a story.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.536
I'm sorry.

29:30.556 --> 29:35.723
My wife's father was a surgeon in Worcester and his father was a surgeon in Worcester and... What was his name?

29:35.956 --> 29:42.804
Seely, S-E-E-L-Y-E, and his father founded Smith College, was the first president of Smith College.

29:42.864 --> 29:50.532
It's a noble lineage that went from academic leadership to medicine.

29:50.612 --> 29:54.297
I met with a young woman at Bates College who was related to Seely.

29:54.857 --> 30:04.528
Well, there's a nest of Seelys out of Worcester, and I had the great good fortune to meet my

30:05.302 --> 30:08.165
the Celia I married in the middle of Alaska.

30:08.185 --> 30:14.932
Tell me a little bit, give me a little biographical background of yourself, unless there's a sketch someplace of you that I can draw.

30:15.173 --> 30:23.442
Well, it's a standard story, and it's almost surely replicated by many, many booksellers these days, as opposed to old days.

30:25.064 --> 30:31.410
I think Larry Whitten is, although he ended up in quite a different area in books, was quite similar to myself.

30:32.151 --> 30:33.773
There are many people that went my route.

30:34.748 --> 30:46.063
I was a high school student interested in literature, and I, for some reason, fell in with an old man who ran the Haverford Club in Philadelphia, in Baltimore.

30:46.904 --> 30:54.173
I was an army brat, traveled as a child, and my mother moved 27 times by herself.

30:55.715 --> 31:02.764
But I was in high school in Baltimore for four years, fell in with the gentleman who ran the Haverford Club, and so when it came

31:02.947 --> 31:07.312
look for college, and I was, of course, going to be a professor of literature.

31:07.352 --> 31:18.764
It was Harvard or Haverford, and I was, my brother had gone to Harvard, and so had my father, and I was much enamored of Haverford, and I went there, and I was extremely happy to have done so.

31:20.987 --> 31:29.376
And I played cricket, and I studied literature and biblical literature, and enjoyed myself in ways that people seemed to have more difficulty doing in college.

31:30.301 --> 31:44.018
It was a highly intellectually motivating place, and the context and one's peers were tremendously... I graduated there in 1960 amongst many gifted people.

31:44.879 --> 31:49.845
I met my wife, who was from Swarthmore, on a Quaker work project.

31:51.026 --> 31:59.717
And the Quaker values sifted down slightly, penetrated my defenses.

32:00.271 --> 32:01.373
more than any other.

32:02.735 --> 32:06.180
And then in graduate school, I was already programmed for graduate school from the beginning.

32:06.220 --> 32:09.906
For some reason, I wrote an honors paper on D.H.

32:09.966 --> 32:14.232
Lawrence as a senior, and for some reason I found it necessary to collect D.H.

32:14.492 --> 32:20.762
Lawrence at that time, and I did so as best I could from the local environs.

32:21.303 --> 32:22.144
And I also had

32:24.301 --> 32:33.092
enjoyed buying books in order to begin to create a library so that all of us would buy from Blackwell's in those glorious days.

32:34.013 --> 32:39.440
And then I simply moved to California to go to graduate school at Berkeley instead of Harvard.

32:40.642 --> 32:47.591
The two choices, because my wife's family had moved west, and it seemed the obvious thing to do at that time.

32:49.793 --> 32:54.139
And I continued to collect the H. Lawrence, which brought me into the touch of

32:54.642 --> 33:04.931
Warren Howell and David McGee and Max Mahunley and John Swingle and Old Oregon Bookstore and Henry Wenning and Margie Cohen, all the major influences on my life in that sentence.

33:07.233 --> 33:20.384
And I also, as a teacher of subject A for six years, there were amongst a few people, two in particular, who were also interested in building a graduate student's library.

33:20.404 --> 33:23.907
And so the three of us, one way or another,

33:24.477 --> 33:38.771
attempted to bring books into our homes, but I found that I obtained more pleasure getting books for them than for myself.

33:40.693 --> 33:52.425
And then one day I found 50 volumes of the Early English Text Society, which the graduate student reading room needed at Berkeley, and I then sold that set to the university librarian at the time, who was a bitch.

33:53.013 --> 33:58.098
and to complain about the fact that I had them rebound because they could have done it cheaper or something.

33:58.839 --> 34:00.761
And from that moment on, I was a bookseller.

34:02.363 --> 34:05.786
I got a license in 1960, resale number in 1963.

34:05.867 --> 34:18.700
I remained from 1960 to 1968 in honorable enrollment as a graduate student, and then in 1968 I left

34:19.692 --> 34:21.034
with all but the dissertation.

34:21.094 --> 34:23.117
I'd been advanced to candidacy.

34:23.137 --> 34:34.133
I'd filled all my language requirements, both Latin and German, and Old English to Middle English, everything but French, which I had never yet studied.

34:37.638 --> 34:42.105
But I had a store in my last year as a graduate student.

34:42.125 --> 34:42.725
In Berkeley.

34:42.745 --> 34:43.827
In Berkeley.

34:44.161 --> 34:52.914
When I bought the entire contents of a store blind at auction and put it in my home, my wife said it was time for me to make a decision.

34:54.436 --> 34:54.796
A career decision.

34:54.817 --> 34:55.337
And I did.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.262
Serendipity was born in that?

34:58.362 --> 35:03.569
Well, it was born in 1963, had a store in 68, $90 a month or so.

35:03.689 --> 35:04.531
Was it serendipity?

35:04.551 --> 35:09.578
It was serendipity from the beginning with a logo from the beginning, a logo that I had

35:11.195 --> 35:21.811
It was an inkblot logo that was co-opted from the Bryn Mawr Haverford Review of 1958 or 9, and I've used it ever since, one way or another, on my catalog.

35:22.652 --> 35:26.137
Did you determine a focus from the beginning, or were you...?

35:26.157 --> 35:29.262
Oh, I was in modern literature, even though that was not subject to my study.

35:30.564 --> 35:36.513
For the longest time, I was principally a student, a bookseller of modern literature.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.177
It's always the most accessible.

35:41.030 --> 35:54.329
group of books, and it's where many people start, particularly if they're uncapitalized.

35:56.913 --> 36:09.872
It's an area, everyone who deals in modern books attracts, let's put it this way, those who deal in modern books are the most visible dealers in our country, and

36:10.493 --> 36:24.632
And the people who are converted to book selling inevitably start by frequenting such stores and then they see someone buy a book for $100 and sell for $600 and instantly conclude that that's for them.

36:24.652 --> 36:32.382
And they start collecting a given author and then they sell that author when they complete the collection.

36:33.944 --> 36:39.471
And if they have some success at it, they're convinced that it's the profession for them because it's

36:40.868 --> 36:44.773
They see the attractive side of the book business.

36:44.793 --> 36:45.995
Are you a collector yourself?

36:46.015 --> 36:46.816
I'm not a collector.

36:47.617 --> 37:00.814
I'm fundamentally against dealers collecting, but it really is only a matter of words.

37:01.735 --> 37:05.560
I'm very much against a dealer cheating on his customers.

37:07.583 --> 37:09.846
That is to say, collecting against his customers.

37:10.670 --> 37:13.455
collecting the very things that he ought to be selling to his customers.

37:14.677 --> 37:16.059
And there are many dealers who do that.

37:16.079 --> 37:21.187
That's the kiss of death when the customer knows that, too, by the way.

37:21.207 --> 37:22.830
The customer knows the dealer is collecting.

37:23.190 --> 37:34.248
Well, there are, of course, a myriad of exceptions immediately to be made, the first of which is, well, you can't deny the pleasure of collecting something that would be stupid.

37:34.268 --> 37:37.774
Often dealers collect in peculiar little corners

37:38.817 --> 37:42.561
which are not necessarily the territory of the customers they then have.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.345
This will inevitably put them in touch with customers.

37:46.766 --> 37:48.248
Many invest by collecting.

37:48.288 --> 38:01.544
This is an element that dominates the book world or is riff on which one can go on indecently forever.

38:04.627 --> 38:08.672
But the emotional life...

38:10.441 --> 38:17.410
And then, of course, there's the wise dealer who collects ahead of the market and who is setting things aside for future sale.

38:18.552 --> 38:29.306
The moment you challenge a dealer whom you know to be buying something for his personal collection and ask him when you buy these books from other people, they're not going to be for sale, right?

38:29.326 --> 38:30.288
They're free, but yeah, that's correct.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.409
These are my personal collection.

38:32.871 --> 38:38.018
And it's a hackneyed remark when the dealer says, oh, this is for my personal collection.

38:39.027 --> 38:49.618
You then ask him, well, when you have bought such things previously, have you refused your dealer discount and paid sales tax?

38:50.239 --> 38:54.583
And inevitably the man says, well, of course I have to choose my dealer discount.

38:54.603 --> 38:58.567
And the whole point of a dealer discount is that it will be for resale.

38:58.687 --> 39:08.157
But many people collect strategically, waiting for Godot has systematically collected every, at all times, a single entity.

39:09.132 --> 39:16.763
in addition to everything else they do, and then when that collection has been fulfilled in their needs, they'll sell it.

39:17.044 --> 39:19.467
And all of us know dealers like that.

39:19.527 --> 39:26.097
In fact, they then become retail customers, i.e., they're the first people one turns to with a given item.

39:26.117 --> 39:36.152
I came here bearing an inscribed Borges for waiting for Godot, if they will pay me what I think I should get, because I know that they're building a serious Borges collection.

39:36.773 --> 39:41.139
And I knew that and I'd sold them interesting Borges items before that.

39:41.800 --> 39:42.921
And I would go out of my way.

39:42.981 --> 39:49.750
I would go to the ends of the earth looking for Borges for them because I regard it as my sworn duty to do so.

39:49.890 --> 39:51.212
It's my emotional duty.

39:51.913 --> 39:53.415
It's a financial responsibility.

39:55.517 --> 40:05.110
And being able to do it for another dealer rather than a private person is only right and proper and credit in heaven as well.

40:05.900 --> 40:27.679
and as soon as you multiply this by all of the dealers in the world, all of whom have long-range collections as well as short-range collections, you are thought to be, you are recognized to be an attentive person.

40:28.480 --> 40:35.586
It's clearly, among other things, a way in which you seek to be

40:39.042 --> 40:41.426
thanked or appreciated.

40:42.367 --> 40:50.099
It's an egregious way to garner stroking or thanks.

40:50.980 --> 40:59.353
And I'm a total victim of this emotional need to be appreciated or admired.

41:00.835 --> 41:07.665
I think it's almost surely one of my most obnoxious qualities.

41:09.367 --> 41:38.631
Once, and I often think kindly of others who seem to be afflicted by the same needs, my two book scouts were, my two greatest book scouts in the world were totally dedicated to aggressively finding for people who, for anyone who was in need of anything, something related to what they needed that they couldn't possibly imagine to have existed.

41:39.505 --> 41:44.170
which these people then, by their sheer genius, were able to find.

41:45.271 --> 41:55.061
And when they do that, over and over and over again, you realize that they're contributing to your understanding of the world, not just the world of books.

41:55.081 --> 42:05.091
They're simply spending all of the bounds of humanity's knowledge in all its multitudinous forms.

42:06.185 --> 42:09.508
And they get an immense pleasure out of it, and it's not measured by money.

42:10.088 --> 42:21.918
In fact, money is only a harmful problem to get over.

42:21.938 --> 42:28.764
You mentioned earlier affection for your customers, and this came out in context with Larry.

42:28.784 --> 42:36.090
We've talked about Larry, but talk to me about that as an element in what you do, the affection that you develop for the people

42:36.290 --> 42:38.512
business with.

42:39.594 --> 42:40.995
I think you've alluded to that.

42:41.235 --> 42:43.738
I think of booksellers with premises.

42:50.746 --> 42:51.447
Well, concomitant.

42:51.747 --> 43:01.437
The satisfaction you get in helping an individual build a collection, so maybe you can work that in as well.

43:01.457 --> 43:05.622
Well, people have various amounts of time for other people.

43:06.057 --> 43:19.770
I have a large premises which enables me to have many relationships with many people, and some of them are up to projects.

43:19.790 --> 43:21.331
They might not even be just people.

43:21.371 --> 43:23.013
They may be institutions as well.

43:23.933 --> 43:35.524
I get an immense pleasure from being able to supply either to an individual customer or an institution

43:35.774 --> 43:42.641
something that they want or need or go to realize that they would like.

43:44.583 --> 43:58.438
And at the same time, I make available a vast range of books in which people are free to discover on their own that they want them without my forcing them down their throat.

43:58.458 --> 44:02.322
And I'm very adept at forcing books down people's throats.

44:03.989 --> 44:09.436
That's not the way I would normally put it, and I don't mean it that way, but that can seem to be the effect on it.

44:10.758 --> 44:31.684
And the degree to which people feel like they are eager to come back to me one way or another is the degree to which I am able to feel that I have a

44:32.170 --> 44:56.581
relationship with that person, these are always relationships that are indirect and are made via the individual book or the collection or the sequence of acquisitions or sales that occur.

44:57.061 --> 44:59.224
Consequently, the relationship

44:59.542 --> 45:02.345
are uniformly indirect.

45:03.025 --> 45:17.339
The direct relationships that book people have are possibly very much fewer than the emotional relationships that obtain in other lives, because the books are always between.

45:17.359 --> 45:25.207
I have a friend, a wonderful friend with whom I am personally very close.

45:25.507 --> 45:27.709
I have a few friends, very few friends,

45:28.347 --> 45:29.669
close friends.

45:32.453 --> 45:38.983
And he has described a bookseller as a person who solves problems caused by books.

45:39.004 --> 45:56.751
And so he could care less about any individual book or the degree to which anybody wants it or the amount of money to be made from it

45:58.604 --> 46:26.164
And I must say that I have gotten quite blasé about the individual book, although I am much more concerned than he about what happens to it and keeping a tentacle on it and being known for having had it and for wanting to have every important book syndrome you'll find in all modern literature

46:26.482 --> 46:45.663
oh, I haven't had this book before, it must be scarce, now I have it, the need to have had experienced every memorable, serious book in modern literature, and indeed I feel I have experienced almost every book, or feel that I'm capable of it.

46:45.864 --> 46:51.170
My friend could care less about such silly emotions.

46:51.290 --> 46:55.054
But if there is a problem caused by books, he...

46:56.283 --> 46:57.805
thinks the bookseller should solve it.

46:58.486 --> 46:59.407
A problem such as?

47:00.088 --> 47:18.873
The problem that somebody has inherited a 19th century Scottish architect's pile of drawings ten feet high that he is the unwitting heir to, and they're important drawings and they need to find their home.

47:19.013 --> 47:22.538
And he walks in and says, what can you do for me?

47:22.698 --> 47:24.400
And there's a problem.

47:24.852 --> 47:30.520
Because these are the real stuff, and their value is not yet determined.

47:30.620 --> 47:40.813
You may do it 50-50, you may do it 80-20, but it's not necessarily that you didn't choose it, it chose you.

47:41.414 --> 47:47.743
And something has to be done, and it's not an experience that you've been programmed to deal with.

47:47.763 --> 47:51.788
You're talking about definite problems, you're not talking about spiritual, intellectual problems.

47:52.443 --> 47:56.047
No, we're talking chiefly about mechanical problems.

47:57.008 --> 48:01.453
Somebody with an intellectual problem can get a copy of a book if he needs it.

48:03.154 --> 48:15.287
No, I mean, what we're doing is making available, putting books in libraries, private and public and institutional, to let people solve their intellectual problems.

48:15.327 --> 48:20.813
No, we're talking about emotional problems and structural problems and mechanical problems.

48:21.890 --> 48:31.579
And there are a lot of lives deeply twisted and committed to books out there.

48:31.599 --> 48:32.720
Far more.

48:32.780 --> 48:33.660
I mean, I have never yet.

48:34.061 --> 48:37.604
I have never in my life met a stamp dealer.

48:37.944 --> 48:41.727
I don't think I've ever met a stamp dealer.

48:41.787 --> 48:43.969
I've barely ever met a coin dealer.

48:45.190 --> 48:50.395
Of course, we all meet print dealers, and they seem to be on the fringes of the book trade rather than

48:50.628 --> 48:53.573
the book trade being on the fringes of the print trade.

48:53.853 --> 48:54.935
Or the art trade for that.

48:54.955 --> 48:56.538
And the art trade is another matter.

48:57.179 --> 48:58.902
The art trade is different.

48:58.922 --> 49:01.506
And it's different from the print trade, too.

49:01.526 --> 49:02.107
Yes, I'm sure.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.111
None of us have any respect for the print trade.

49:04.131 --> 49:08.638
There are very few print dealers among us with any stature.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.163
They do not command our respect.

49:11.183 --> 49:13.767
They are chiefly regarded as people carve up books.

49:14.320 --> 49:21.172
Well, like Grand Marader, he's only taken it to its logical conclusions.

49:21.252 --> 49:23.295
It's just that we don't like the logical conclusions.

49:24.177 --> 49:37.560
By involving corporations in the acquisition of better prints for their walls, he simply expanded the market and he can absorb any

49:40.072 --> 49:48.587
He can go after the top end of prints and pay any price for them, because he'll simply charge more by carving them up, and he has a market that can pay more.

49:48.607 --> 49:51.672
Tell me what you feel about people such as Mr. Arater.

49:51.692 --> 49:54.998
Well, I mean, everybody feels the same about Arater.

49:55.078 --> 50:03.092
Some would sell to him, some wouldn't, and I think he enjoys universal despite in our profession.

50:03.848 --> 50:07.352
But he's also a hard-working, successful businessman.

50:07.372 --> 50:09.935
I'm not sure who cares that that's true.

50:11.636 --> 50:19.645
The odd phenomenon is that he may work harder than any of us, although I'm very reluctant to say that anybody works harder than I do.

50:19.945 --> 50:21.387
Well, he's a successful businessman.

50:21.407 --> 50:23.129
Yes, of course.

50:23.830 --> 50:25.171
And he's a successful businessman.

50:25.211 --> 50:27.814
He's not in our thoughts, is the fact.

50:28.250 --> 50:34.159
And he makes it effectively impossible for very many kinds of dealers to deal in the kinds of books that he's carving up.

50:35.802 --> 50:37.985
So that it's not relevant.

50:38.085 --> 50:40.309
I'm going to turn this on the other side.

50:41.070 --> 50:47.220
It's simply not relevant because the kinds of books that he monopolizes are not available to the rest of us.

50:47.280 --> 50:52.848
And he, fortunately, is less interested in many of the books that the rest of us are interested in.

50:52.868 --> 50:53.229
You know the book?

50:53.289 --> 50:56.434
He and Bill Reese won the Yale Book Collecting Prize.

50:56.532 --> 50:59.295
I think I did know that, actually.

50:59.315 --> 51:00.496
It is interesting, isn't it?

51:00.516 --> 51:11.388
There are quite different types of dealers, even though both entered the trade with considerable family assets.

51:11.468 --> 51:24.362
There's no one more highly regarded than Bill Reese and no one more attentive to the needs of his colleagues than Bill Reese.

51:24.815 --> 51:42.859
And there's no one who I think enjoys the attention and respect of the academic community into which he sells a great number of books than Bill Reese.

51:42.900 --> 51:43.520
Oh, I know.

51:44.301 --> 51:49.348
Bill Reese is simply a first-class book.

51:49.428 --> 51:54.315
So there's a large number of people with serious scholarly attainments

51:56.354 --> 52:23.139
who've run into the book business in the last 30 years, replacing, of course, there had been a tradition of academic excellence and scholarly research capacities in the book trade from the beginning, but these people are not commonly in the book business.

52:23.419 --> 52:25.821
And he is certainly one of them.

52:26.105 --> 52:33.448
As is... I'm going to stop.
