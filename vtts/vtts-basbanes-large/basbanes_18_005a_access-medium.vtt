00:01.702 --> 00:09.110
The production on the Griffiths was done in London and I was there once because six months after the film was finished I was still writing.

00:09.731 --> 00:28.030
And I went over and Stephen and the other people had spent the morning adding the sound of the elevator to John Cusack's apartment.

00:28.212 --> 00:31.676
whenever the elevator went up and down, he could hear it in his apartment.

00:32.197 --> 00:40.407
They'd spent the morning putting that in and looking at it and listening to it and deciding it didn't work, and now they were going to spend the afternoon taking it out again.

00:40.427 --> 00:43.010
Everybody's getting paid all this time, too, right?

00:43.030 --> 00:45.854
Well, yes, but that's boring.

00:45.934 --> 00:51.141
And so, meanwhile, I'm off, you know, happily making something else up.

00:51.161 --> 00:57.088
So between the...

00:57.946 --> 01:00.969
the wrong temperament and the impatience.

01:01.049 --> 01:06.194
I would never be a good director, so my job is writer.

01:06.394 --> 01:11.960
And for that, you know, okay, I do my best, and then it's up to them.

01:13.621 --> 01:17.005
Bill Goldman has always said that.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.529
He won't go near a film while it's being shot.

01:21.910 --> 01:22.170
Really?

01:22.430 --> 01:26.434
Yeah, Stephen Frears wanted me on the set, and I was on the set, and I enjoyed it.

01:27.072 --> 01:31.157
But Bill Goldman says, I've done my job now.

01:31.177 --> 01:32.559
It's up to them to do this.

01:32.719 --> 01:35.323
And of course, he's been paid very well for this.

01:35.884 --> 01:39.208
And I guess once the check clears, you can do anything you want with it, right?

01:39.468 --> 01:39.989
Yeah, I know.

01:40.970 --> 01:45.997
Twenty-some years ago, he did the screenplay from a book of mine called The Hot Rock.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.540
And he lives in New York.

01:48.706 --> 02:11.136
and they shot the film in new york and the day they started shooting he went to paris really and he didn't come back until they were finished isn't that something maybe the directors like that too but maybe also they want you around if they well it depends you know stephen uh is english and television trained and he likes

02:11.977 --> 02:16.024
The writer being around, he likes that collaborative aspect.

02:17.086 --> 02:27.824
A movie that I did before that was called The Stepfather, and Joe Rubin directed that, and he couldn't wait for me to get out of town.

02:28.265 --> 02:34.976
They shot it in Vancouver, and I came back here, and I think he had spies to let him know if I were to cross the Hudson River.

02:36.078 --> 02:36.178
Yeah.

02:37.812 --> 02:39.336
Well, we got along up to then, wasn't it?

02:39.356 --> 02:45.430
He was just not used to the idea of having another creator around while he was lording it over the set.

02:45.550 --> 02:46.833
What do you enjoy doing most?

02:46.973 --> 02:48.136
What's more satisfying?

02:48.156 --> 02:49.258
Oh, novels, novels.

02:49.278 --> 02:56.074
Sure, sure, because that's, you know, then I'm the whole cheese then, you know, and I am the set decorator and everything else.

02:57.117 --> 03:00.561
And you've probably got more pseudonyms than Evan Hunter, too, right?

03:01.242 --> 03:01.963
I understand.

03:01.983 --> 03:04.246
You've probably written on the... Maybe not.

03:04.266 --> 03:04.747
I don't know.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.008
Well, probably a tie.

03:06.589 --> 03:08.371
He's got four or five that I know of.

03:10.193 --> 03:11.535
But tell me about that.

03:11.555 --> 03:13.998
Is that mainly a commercial imperative?

03:14.399 --> 03:20.647
That was because... It was a sort of brand-name thing, another way General Motors does it.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.569
You know, this is a Cadillac and this is a Chevy.

03:23.490 --> 03:25.673
And also, back...

03:26.277 --> 03:35.168
It's been a long while since I've done pseudonyms because film takes the place.

03:35.808 --> 03:41.095
The time that Richard Stark used to spend writing three novels, now I spend rewriting one screenplay.

03:41.856 --> 03:46.501
You don't write movies, you rewrite them.

03:46.601 --> 03:56.233
So I was quite prolific and I was doing too much stuff for one name and I was doing a variety of things so it seemed

03:56.534 --> 04:21.377
good idea to put different names on them i mean i did an interview with them a couple months ago and uh and he said a lot of it just there were times when when he he could get stories multiple stories in the same issue you know the magazine but so you had to have two different bylines there oh yeah oh yeah i was around the same time at manhunt magazine and a couple of those sure yeah i was there too i mean he says you know i mean you don't want to let a name get in the way of a sale and uh

04:23.888 --> 04:25.611
That's something, huh?

04:25.691 --> 04:30.438
I mean, so you are really a quintessentially professional writer then.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.821
I mean, this is your life.

04:32.841 --> 04:33.963
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:34.504 --> 04:37.107
And how many novels to your credit?

04:37.768 --> 04:46.922
Well, it's somewhere around 40 under my name and probably something over 30 on other names.

04:47.783 --> 04:50.487
So there comes a point where there's really...

04:51.243 --> 04:52.565
Nothing to be gained by counting.

04:52.885 --> 04:53.586
Any favorites?

04:56.290 --> 04:57.591
Well, always the most recent one.

04:57.872 --> 04:58.553
Always.

04:58.773 --> 05:07.064
You know, because it's still, you know, all of the triumphs and defeats and sudden surprises and everything are still fresh in my mind.

05:07.084 --> 05:10.368
You know, saying, oh, my God, I remember when I suddenly figured out how to do that.

05:10.949 --> 05:14.193
But then there are some that stay with you.

05:16.096 --> 05:16.356
Uh...

05:17.753 --> 05:22.579
So the only other one I would mention actually has sort of an odd history.

05:23.541 --> 05:27.125
It was called Kahawa, K-A-H-A-W-A.

05:28.047 --> 05:30.430
It was published in 1982 very badly.

05:31.091 --> 05:35.817
The publishing company was undergoing upheavals at the time.

05:37.739 --> 05:39.722
Just for curiosity, who?

05:39.742 --> 05:40.843
It was Viking.

05:40.863 --> 05:41.424
It was Viking.

05:42.465 --> 05:44.068
I don't think... No, I won't mention that.

05:44.088 --> 05:46.731
I don't think there's anybody there now who was there then in 1982.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.392
It was just a mess.

05:48.412 --> 05:56.761
And it was supposed to be a caber, and it was originally called Coffee to Go.

05:56.801 --> 06:00.745
And it was set in Uganda under Idi Amin.

06:00.765 --> 06:04.609
That was another time when I had to go look at the place.

06:04.649 --> 06:05.710
You know, it was far from New York.

06:06.651 --> 06:09.695
You went there while Idi Amin was in trouble?

06:09.715 --> 06:10.115
No, no, no.

06:10.135 --> 06:11.757
It was...

06:12.428 --> 06:15.892
He was gone and never and never.

06:16.132 --> 06:17.414
He was out at that point, wasn't he?

06:17.434 --> 06:18.375
Yeah, January 77.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.537
He was run out.

06:20.877 --> 06:23.721
And I went to Kenya.

06:23.781 --> 06:26.404
Because part of the story was in Kenya and part of it was Uganda.

06:26.544 --> 06:29.948
And Uganda was still in utter turmoil at that time.

06:29.988 --> 06:34.953
And very few people who went into Uganda came back out again.

06:35.374 --> 06:37.416
And they were eating people there.

06:37.456 --> 06:38.237
And I'm protein.

06:38.938 --> 06:39.398
Jesus Christ.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.573
No joke.

06:42.593 --> 06:47.180
So I went to Lake Victoria and looked across at Uganda.

06:47.961 --> 06:48.762
Well, I've been here.

06:48.822 --> 06:51.005
I know what it looks like, right?

06:51.947 --> 06:52.427
Yeah.

06:52.988 --> 06:58.576
And I talked to a lot of people in Kenya who knew stuff.

06:58.616 --> 07:07.309
But the thing was that when I started to do some research on Idi Amin and his time,

07:08.993 --> 07:31.997
and that'd be a great title and it's all right yeah yeah uh and what he had done and everything and there there came a point i called my editor and said i can't dance on all those graves this is not a comedy so it it got larger and sort of out of hand and and uh i wound up

07:32.197 --> 07:36.783
liking that book more than any other because it used more of me than any other.

07:36.883 --> 07:40.808
There's comedy in there, but there's also what Richard Stark used to do.

07:40.848 --> 07:46.536
And it was like all the pen names got together to collaborate on this book.

07:46.556 --> 07:49.520
And so I couldn't call a coffee to go.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.445
And so I was trying to think of...

07:53.982 --> 07:55.364
larger, more serious titles.

07:55.384 --> 07:57.427
You know, you come up with things like Time of the Hero.

07:57.707 --> 08:02.775
And I figured, if I'm going to fall asleep partway through the title, it's probably a bad title.

08:02.795 --> 08:03.476
Sure.

08:03.496 --> 08:07.782
And so eventually I called it Kahava, which is Swahili for coffee.

08:08.803 --> 08:11.628
And I call it, I say it's Swahili for, we couldn't think of a title.

08:13.110 --> 08:16.775
And now Warner Books, bless their hearts.

08:18.277 --> 08:20.801
This was their idea, not mine, oddly enough.

08:22.463 --> 08:23.044
They...

08:23.429 --> 08:30.096
agree that the book was published badly and they are going to republish it in hardcover all over again.

08:30.116 --> 08:30.496
Jeez.

08:32.017 --> 08:33.219
That's pretty damn decent.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.740
I am delighted.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.322
But I'm sure they see a market for it.

08:36.862 --> 08:37.303
I hope so.

08:37.323 --> 08:41.847
You don't see that much, what's the word I'm looking for?

08:41.867 --> 08:43.509
You know what I'm saying?

08:44.269 --> 08:47.993
They don't do these things unless there's a good commercial reason for it.

08:48.113 --> 08:49.735
I hope they're right about it.

08:49.755 --> 08:53.098
When it got out, it got wonderful reviews.

08:53.382 --> 08:57.970
I just have to quote you, just my favorite line from any review ever.

09:00.535 --> 09:07.988
John Leonard in the Daily New York Times said, I don't want to know anybody who doesn't like this book.

09:08.509 --> 09:08.910
Really?

09:09.971 --> 09:12.015
That's a great one.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.226
John can be pretty opinionated.

09:16.168 --> 09:19.255
That's a great quote.

09:19.816 --> 09:21.900
Toledo is one of my papers, by the way.

09:22.381 --> 09:32.502
I mean, I love it because when a publicist calls me and asks me if I'm interested in an author, I can actually say, well, will it play in Toledo?

09:33.730 --> 09:34.811
Well, maybe this one will.

09:35.312 --> 09:36.593
It will, because they're going to get it.

09:36.854 --> 09:39.757
I've got about 15 papers that take me now.

09:40.018 --> 09:43.182
I've been syndicating myself with some success.

09:44.023 --> 09:45.164
Just got Salt Lake City.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.305
They start next week.

09:46.345 --> 09:50.771
I just got Knoxville, Tennessee, Columbus a couple times a month.

09:52.173 --> 09:56.638
We'll be able to get you into some places where the publicists don't normally go.

09:56.938 --> 09:58.320
Right.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.121
Let me just think now.

10:00.742 --> 10:08.169
Any comments on the state of American journalism on the strength of these two novels here?

10:08.930 --> 10:12.613
Is this a commentary or are you just using a fat and dumb easy target?

10:14.115 --> 10:17.318
Well, I don't know.

10:17.358 --> 10:28.729
It seems to me that when the reporters sat down at table

10:29.553 --> 10:55.662
with their subjects with the subjects were politicians or uh... showbiz people or or whatever that something was inevitably lost in the net and that we're seeing that these extremes of of uh... fawning and loathing and i think that they're too close that that uh...

10:56.671 --> 11:03.699
The journalist is supposed to be standing in the snow looking in the window, God damn it, and then come back and tell you what he saw.

11:03.719 --> 11:17.214
I'll tell you, I've been in this business for a lot of years, and nothing I detest more than some reporter to tell you how hard it was for him to get the story or how mad he is at somebody for not talking to him or her.

11:18.035 --> 11:18.575
Who cares?

11:18.655 --> 11:19.376
It's irrelevant.

11:19.496 --> 11:22.380
I mean, they don't care anything about me at all.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.602
I mean, it's the story I have to tell.

11:25.190 --> 11:30.799
But I think also we're not supposed to look too deeply for meanings and messages in your books, too, right?

11:30.819 --> 11:35.146
I mean, you've quoted Sam Goldman on this, I think.

11:35.166 --> 11:35.286
Right.

11:35.306 --> 11:36.247
Which is a great quote.

11:36.528 --> 11:39.152
I mean, storytelling is all, I think.

11:39.693 --> 11:41.616
Yes, storytelling is the point of it.

11:41.656 --> 11:46.984
And there are a lot of people who think they're making a statement about the world we live in and all that.

11:47.044 --> 11:52.513
And just if you set a novel in present-day America, you can't help it.

11:53.455 --> 12:00.325
I mean, there's a statement there, you know, just the way you describe an automobile is going to show a lot about your own attitudes towards life.

12:00.545 --> 12:10.480
And to say, well, that means I'm a philosopher of the American zeitgeist is a little pretentious.

12:10.500 --> 12:16.729
So, no, what is there is there, and so...

12:17.266 --> 12:22.613
Whatever byproducts there may be, the principal product of this factory is story.

12:23.975 --> 12:26.838
And when was your first book published?

12:26.858 --> 12:28.220
You go back to the 30s.

12:28.260 --> 12:28.620
1960.

12:29.201 --> 12:29.361
Wow.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.043
1960, yep.

12:31.063 --> 12:33.647
And you were a mere lad at that time?

12:35.069 --> 12:37.632
I guess I'm asking you how old you are.

12:37.852 --> 12:40.295
Yeah, I'm 61.

12:42.037 --> 12:46.463
I'll tell you the way things always work.

12:47.557 --> 12:56.307
Random House bought my first book, and the editor said, we're going to publish in July.

12:56.847 --> 13:04.175
And at that time, back in 1960, remember, the New York Times used to have this thing published today, a little thing.

13:04.215 --> 13:06.258
No, I don't remember that, but that's interesting.

13:06.278 --> 13:08.120
Yeah, it was like, you know.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.122
What they did is they printed pub dates.

13:10.338 --> 13:18.002
Yeah, but yeah, so there was a little box in Every Day's Times that they published today, and there'd be this little list of books that the...

13:18.472 --> 13:20.735
that the regular trade publishers had published that day.

13:20.795 --> 13:23.158
It's like the ship sailing news that you said.

13:23.198 --> 13:24.340
That's kind of cute, actually.

13:24.380 --> 13:24.600
Yeah.

13:24.821 --> 13:27.524
But totally worthless because nobody abides by these dates.

13:27.785 --> 13:28.005
Right.

13:28.646 --> 13:29.467
Absolutely.

13:29.847 --> 13:32.992
Then that became published recently.

13:33.392 --> 13:35.836
And then they dropped it.

13:35.856 --> 13:36.036
Yeah.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.318
Well, it's probably best.

13:37.418 --> 13:37.658
Yeah.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.342
But they were still doing publishing published today.

13:40.362 --> 13:44.327
I mean, John Irving's book is published on the 5th.

13:44.830 --> 13:46.131
next week.

13:46.412 --> 13:48.614
It's on every bestseller list all over America.

13:49.615 --> 13:51.037
Which is ridiculous.

13:51.057 --> 13:53.179
Which is why I ran my interview with him this week.

13:53.259 --> 13:55.502
I said, I may as well.

13:55.582 --> 13:57.263
It's an exclusive for another two weeks.

13:57.324 --> 13:59.025
He hasn't had him the first person to talk to.

13:59.065 --> 14:01.308
I may as well get a little mileage out of it.

14:03.410 --> 14:08.976
Anyway, so I said to the editor, she said it's going to be published in July.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.220
And I said, well, my birthday is July 12th.

14:12.860 --> 14:13.521
Could we

14:14.176 --> 14:15.498
Could it be July 12th?

14:15.538 --> 14:19.002
You know, then I'm going to get a thing in the Times that says published today and it's going to be on my birthday.

14:19.402 --> 14:20.143
She said, fine.

14:21.325 --> 14:23.788
So... That's great.

14:23.908 --> 14:24.468
Everything was said.

14:24.508 --> 14:25.410
It was my first book.

14:26.050 --> 14:26.871
Everything is great.

14:27.132 --> 14:32.398
We're going to have a combination birthday publication party.

14:33.039 --> 14:40.668
And about a week beforehand, before July 12th, I said to my editor, I'm going to be doing this.

14:40.688 --> 14:42.310
And she said, oh, I forgot.

14:42.627 --> 14:45.149
I forgot to tell them.

14:45.169 --> 14:47.211
So actually the publication date is July 27th.

14:47.411 --> 14:50.314
Oh, shit.

14:50.374 --> 14:55.459
My first book is being published next year on August 22nd, which is my wife's birthday.

14:56.380 --> 14:56.700
Aha.

14:57.621 --> 14:58.242
If they remember.

14:59.142 --> 15:03.627
And they will because they were supposed to publish it in March or April and they said they wanted a couple more months.

15:05.128 --> 15:09.512
So I said, fine, make it August 22nd.

15:10.015 --> 15:10.756
I'm with Hope.

15:11.316 --> 15:12.737
It's a nonfiction book.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.480
It's a book about bibliomania, book madness.

15:16.060 --> 15:16.181
Ah.

15:16.821 --> 15:19.524
And I spent a few years researching it.

15:20.304 --> 15:22.967
You remember the guy that stole the 26,000 books?

15:23.587 --> 15:25.329
He had an apartment for them.

15:25.389 --> 15:26.970
He had a house in Ottumwa, Iowa.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.451
I went to his trial and he took me.

15:28.472 --> 15:30.393
I had the only interview with him.

15:30.473 --> 15:31.354
I went to the house.

15:31.754 --> 15:32.095
Right.

15:32.115 --> 15:34.417
An old Victorian house in Ottumwa.

15:34.437 --> 15:36.138
That's where Edna Ferber was from.

15:36.158 --> 15:37.980
I was going to think because it was a guy in New York.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.484
who did the same thing, and he had a separate apartment for his books.

15:40.504 --> 15:44.369
Oh, this guy, Stephen, stole from 350 libraries all over the country.

15:44.670 --> 15:49.136
The books were said to be valued at $20 million, more like $6 or $7 million, but who's going to argue?

15:49.296 --> 15:50.118
Right.

15:50.138 --> 15:53.643
But what I loved about him is he stole them to keep them, not to sell them.

15:53.663 --> 15:54.203
He loved them.

15:56.066 --> 15:56.947
He was impassioned.

15:57.969 --> 16:00.713
I think we've covered a good deal, don't you think?

16:01.053 --> 16:01.895
Yes.

16:01.935 --> 16:04.919
Is there anything that I should know that I don't?

16:04.959 --> 16:07.022
I guess when did you know you were funny?

16:07.424 --> 16:10.438
When did you know that you could make people laugh in your writing?

16:11.483 --> 16:16.185
Because, I mean, I'll tell you, if you think you can make people laugh and you can't,

16:17.887 --> 16:28.079
I mean, nothing puts me off more than reading a book where a guy cracks a joke and everybody laughs in the book.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.341
Oh, God, yeah.

16:29.401 --> 16:32.685
But, I mean, that destroys it, don't you think?

16:32.765 --> 16:34.727
Yeah, I don't think I would ever type that sentence.

16:34.787 --> 16:36.109
No, but you know that sentence.

16:36.169 --> 16:36.670
I've seen it.

16:36.990 --> 16:39.874
They're falling on the floor in laughter.

16:40.274 --> 16:40.975
Yeah, I know.

16:42.797 --> 16:45.160
The thing is that I was...

16:46.034 --> 16:47.236
I love the modern world.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.819
You're getting a fax, even as we speak.

16:48.839 --> 16:49.540
Yeah, as we speak.

16:50.061 --> 16:52.004
That's right.

16:52.024 --> 16:52.464
Not for me.

16:52.505 --> 16:53.406
I'm looking at my machine.

16:53.426 --> 16:54.167
It's not doing anything.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.069
No, it's mine.

16:55.089 --> 16:56.090
I can see it coming out.

16:57.873 --> 17:03.222
So, I was... About comedy, I wasn't funny at first.

17:03.282 --> 17:07.008
The first... I mean, from 1960 to 65... Did you try?

17:07.028 --> 17:07.088
No.

17:07.950 --> 17:08.130
No.

17:08.470 --> 17:09.292
No.

17:09.452 --> 17:11.876
I was trying to be, you know, do it right.

17:11.936 --> 17:13.138
I was trying to be...

17:13.591 --> 17:16.073
a regular guy and do it the way you're supposed to.

17:16.734 --> 17:25.663
Because all the time that I was growing up, and in fact into my 20s, I was never the funniest kid in class.

17:25.683 --> 17:27.225
I was never the funniest person around.

17:27.585 --> 17:29.767
I was always the funniest kid's best friend.

17:30.888 --> 17:31.749
I was the appreciator.

17:31.769 --> 17:33.451
I was the laugher.

17:33.591 --> 17:34.812
You were the Ed McMahon.

17:35.753 --> 17:37.935
Yeah, I was the Ed McMahon, exactly.

17:38.536 --> 17:43.581
I was the one who had to stay after class because I was the one who was behaving like a buffoon.

17:44.658 --> 17:51.191
So it never occurred to me that I should try to be funny because that was the funny guy.

17:51.312 --> 17:52.434
You know, I was his friend.

17:53.356 --> 17:59.529
So then in 65, I started another book and it started to come out funny.

18:00.310 --> 18:04.118
And I didn't know why, but it just did...

18:04.807 --> 18:09.572
I mean, it was that first-person narrator, and he just had this funny take on life.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.855
And I called my agent and said, it's coming out funny.

18:12.915 --> 18:14.217
And he said, don't do that.

18:15.117 --> 18:17.320
I said, you'll never get a paperback sale.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.125
I said, nobody can translate comedy, so you're not going to get any foreign sales.

18:22.145 --> 18:23.206
Gee, I never thought of that.

18:23.586 --> 18:24.187
That's right.

18:24.207 --> 18:25.348
Yeah.

18:25.468 --> 18:25.868
It's true.

18:25.928 --> 18:27.350
Nobody can translate comedy.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.352
I don't know what those books look like in foreign languages.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.114
In Japanese, especially.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.195
Oh, yes.

18:33.296 --> 18:33.396
Yeah.

18:33.511 --> 18:37.177
But anyway, so I said, well, it's going fast.

18:37.578 --> 18:43.809
You know, I'll just get it out of my system this time, and then I'll go back and do it right next time.

18:43.829 --> 18:46.033
And that was the end of me, you know.

18:46.714 --> 18:48.277
Do they translate these things for you?

18:49.679 --> 18:50.761
Yeah, yeah.

18:50.781 --> 18:54.547
I've been translated into something like 15 languages.

18:54.788 --> 18:55.950
And are they funny?

18:56.010 --> 18:56.110
Yeah.

18:56.984 --> 18:57.746
I guess so.

18:57.786 --> 19:00.654
People tell me that because I don't read anything.

19:00.954 --> 19:01.997
There's one country in the world.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.982
Here's a trivia question.

19:04.002 --> 19:06.088
It's my only trivia question.

19:06.108 --> 19:09.777
There's one country in the world in which I'm published in three languages.

19:09.797 --> 19:10.439
One country.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.404
Yeah.

19:12.424 --> 19:12.765
All right.

19:15.142 --> 19:21.828
Well, it has to be a country that has a number of official languages, like Canada, right, which has French and English.

19:21.848 --> 19:23.930
So it must be French and English up there.

19:23.950 --> 19:24.751
So what's the third?

19:24.811 --> 19:25.972
Alaskan or something?

19:26.813 --> 19:27.153
No.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.275
I don't know.

19:28.575 --> 19:29.616
All right, so it's Spain.

19:30.477 --> 19:32.719
It's Spanish, Catalan, and Basque.

19:33.399 --> 19:35.081
And you're published in those three languages?

19:35.842 --> 19:36.182
Wow.

19:36.462 --> 19:38.064
How many different languages altogether?

19:38.584 --> 19:39.806
I think it's about 15 now.

19:40.406 --> 19:40.706
Good for you.

19:40.726 --> 19:44.490
Those three in French and Italian and German and...

19:44.808 --> 19:48.453
all of the Scandinavian languages and Russian and Japanese.

19:49.975 --> 19:50.456
Jeez.

19:50.476 --> 19:50.977
And Czech.

19:51.918 --> 19:53.781
And they keep doing it, so they must be funny.

19:54.121 --> 19:54.742
They must be.

19:55.543 --> 19:56.345
I don't know what they think.

19:57.827 --> 20:01.652
Well, listen, I think I've taken up a lot of your time, and I've got plenty of stuff here.

20:02.413 --> 20:02.513
Okay.

20:02.533 --> 20:05.978
And I'll be moving this along pretty quickly.

20:06.018 --> 20:11.727
Susan's sending me some, I need a bunch of photographs to send in my various newspapers.

20:11.947 --> 20:12.047
Okay.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.222
And it'll be along shortly.

20:14.564 --> 20:14.945
Okay.

20:15.528 --> 20:17.295
And I enjoyed talking to you.

20:17.355 --> 20:17.676
Thank you.

20:17.736 --> 20:20.066
So did I. And I hope we do it again sometime.

20:20.447 --> 20:20.809
Take care.

20:20.889 --> 20:21.732
All right.

20:21.792 --> 20:21.953
Bye-bye.
