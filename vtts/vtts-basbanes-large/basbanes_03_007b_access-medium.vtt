WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:22.656
One of the other things that we do is we try for each of those representatives or senators, we try to get them to come to a hospital, a health center, a clinic in their own home district, in their own area, read to kids, be there, and, you know, make it real to them that this is because we have those 2,000 programs.

00:22.676 --> 00:25.380
We have programs in every state.

00:25.462 --> 00:31.748
this department does is try to get these sites to connect up with their representatives so that the representatives realize it's here.

00:31.768 --> 00:37.173
It's, you know, everyone likes to go to the local children's hospital and be photographed.

00:37.253 --> 00:49.644
Reading to kids and handing out books is a, it's a great little thing to, it's a great incentive to get them to come and learn about what physicians are doing.

00:49.664 --> 00:54.709
You know, it really stands out in my mind and it's something that you said in this lecture that you gave, which I

00:55.195 --> 01:07.210
found on the internet, but where you're talking about ten books, basically, during this period of six months to five years old, that the cost is about twenty-five dollars.

01:08.311 --> 01:09.032
Twenty-five bucks.

01:10.714 --> 01:14.819
Well, in the medical world, that's pretty true.

01:15.359 --> 01:19.885
One extra unnecessary blood test, you're there.

01:19.905 --> 01:23.329
And how vital it turns out to be.

01:24.187 --> 01:28.652
Anyway, I'll be in touch as I proceed on this, and I thank you so much.

01:28.692 --> 01:29.893
You're welcome.

01:29.953 --> 01:30.814
Thanks for what you're doing.

01:30.894 --> 01:31.935
It's wonderful.

01:35.620 --> 01:49.755
So the selection really is by, the content is not really, I know the content's important, but really you're following a program of what's appropriate at this particular level, right?

01:50.073 --> 01:51.716
How are you?

01:51.736 --> 01:53.520
Pleasure to meet you.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.226
I'm the director of finance and administration.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.529
A very important person.

01:57.549 --> 01:58.972
A very important person.

01:58.992 --> 02:04.242
Regarding the sacks of paper, I think, at this point, making sure there's no lit match.

02:04.283 --> 02:08.050
They didn't say it.

02:08.090 --> 02:09.974
Are we now compliant with the fire code?

02:10.856 --> 02:11.237
I know.

02:11.622 --> 02:16.527
I went and had a piece of pita bread yesterday, and I took it out of the toaster too early.

02:17.188 --> 02:19.871
And after I walked out of the room, there was a fire.

02:19.891 --> 02:22.814
And someone went and got the extinguisher.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.816
I don't even want to know.

02:26.097 --> 02:26.698
Oh, God.

02:27.259 --> 02:28.019
That's funny.

02:28.220 --> 02:29.861
Okay.

02:29.961 --> 02:35.267
This place is big.

02:35.602 --> 02:36.864
Yeah, it's kind of a war.

02:36.884 --> 02:37.284
Go ahead.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.908
This is now, that side is kind of administration.

02:40.309 --> 02:41.270
This is programs.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.534
Everybody.

02:46.117 --> 02:48.200
This is Joel, Emma, Helen.

02:48.541 --> 02:49.803
And I'm Nick, Nick Bazbrains.

02:49.823 --> 02:51.706
I'm writing about your program.

02:52.026 --> 03:05.085
And when people are interested in starting a program, they start here with Helen and, you know, we say they're interested in the program and she kind of walks them through the process of putting in an application and finding out about

03:05.723 --> 03:07.385
Water Reach Out and Read program does.

03:07.466 --> 03:12.393
And then this department is how we keep in touch with the programs.

03:12.413 --> 03:13.134
We monitor them.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.297
They do semi-annual progress reports.

03:15.818 --> 03:17.280
We keep them in touch with each other.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.708
There's just sort of an enormous amount of information, information management, and sort of program support that goes on here.

03:24.531 --> 03:24.792
Okay.

03:25.192 --> 03:26.434
We're heading for you, Jackie.

03:26.915 --> 03:32.423
We're going to end up with you as a book catalog in the book.

03:33.652 --> 03:36.796
So, again, this is... Hello.

03:36.817 --> 03:36.937
Hi.

03:37.137 --> 03:38.819
Pleased to meet you.

03:38.839 --> 03:39.300
This is... Nick.

03:40.021 --> 03:41.463
Nice to meet you.

03:42.144 --> 03:45.128
And we're going to also get you materials as you're going.

03:45.148 --> 03:46.330
You need materials, right?

03:46.510 --> 03:53.580
Bunmi is in charge of the Massachusetts Coalition of Reach Out and Read programs, and her background is actually in education.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.423
And Jackie...

03:55.758 --> 04:00.926
I promise you, you're going to meet people with backgrounds in education and library as we wander through the program.

04:00.947 --> 04:06.876
Jackie's very involved with the books, the book choice and the book catalog, and you asked me about how we choose the books.

04:07.497 --> 04:12.065
I haven't actually found you a catalog yet, but if you want to go with Jackie, I'll find you some materials.

04:12.806 --> 04:13.848
Oh, great, thanks.

04:14.809 --> 04:15.230
My book.

04:16.412 --> 04:17.794
I was wondering if you would find the autograph.

04:17.814 --> 04:18.616
Oh, it's my pleasure.

04:18.656 --> 04:19.597
Great.

04:19.617 --> 04:21.360
Are you kidding?

04:22.808 --> 04:25.691
to Jackie Miller, National Programs Coordinator.

04:25.711 --> 04:33.160
Well, obviously, I'm interested in content as well as how you go about selecting the book that you use for it.

04:33.180 --> 04:33.960
Do you want to sit down?

04:33.980 --> 04:34.281
Sure.

04:34.301 --> 04:34.661
Do you mind?

04:34.942 --> 04:35.442
No, no, no.

04:36.183 --> 04:37.805
Do you mind if I shoot a picture to you?

04:37.925 --> 04:40.227
You can move the chair.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.249
OK.

04:41.289 --> 04:47.375
Oh, let's see.

04:48.637 --> 04:49.117
Don't mind.

04:49.518 --> 04:49.778
Maybe.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.495
I have a digital camera here.

04:58.019 --> 04:58.680
What's wrong with that?

04:58.700 --> 04:59.941
That's a nice picture.

05:00.001 --> 05:04.527
Go ahead.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.170
Where would you like me to start?

05:07.190 --> 05:22.549
Well, I was talking with Dr. Klaas specifically about how the books function, 10 books over five years, and how does she, is it possible even to measure the impact of individual

05:23.558 --> 05:26.641
I guess it's a lot of them.

05:28.122 --> 05:30.024
Well, we have a lot of anecdotal evidence.

05:31.225 --> 05:35.349
The parents going back to the doctors and telling them their own stories.

05:37.190 --> 05:42.975
We also have research pieces that do prove that it does make a difference overall.

05:44.197 --> 05:48.941
Some of the stories that we hear from the doctors are just so heart-touching, and it's wonderful.

05:49.481 --> 05:49.882
Like what?

05:49.942 --> 05:51.003
Can you think of anything?

05:51.043 --> 05:53.565
I know it's hard to come up with one.

05:54.068 --> 05:56.711
But what kinds of things do you hear?

05:57.372 --> 06:09.988
Well, I had this crusty old nurse come up to me at one of the shows I went to, and she said in this terrific Louisiana accent, when I first heard we were going to be giving books away to the kids, I thought it was the dumbest thing.

06:10.008 --> 06:10.308
Really?

06:10.629 --> 06:13.472
It was just another giveaway program that would fall apart in two months.

06:14.474 --> 06:23.485
But I've got to tell you, the kids love it, the parents love it, and the parents are coming in on time because they know their kids are going to get a book, and their mothers are telling us,

06:23.819 --> 06:28.023
All their kids want to do is read, have their mothers read to them.

06:28.043 --> 06:37.613
And you see, as Dr. Kless was saying, sometimes, and it may be that these are the only ten books that some of these kids will get.

06:37.693 --> 06:46.702
You would hope, on the other hand, that it would encourage them to augment the, I mean, it's not just the one book you're getting every six months.

06:47.082 --> 06:53.168
But if it's just the ten, then the selection process that you do becomes very important, doesn't it?

06:53.401 --> 06:55.803
Maybe you can just talk a little bit about that.

06:57.845 --> 07:03.811
Well, Scholastic, somebody here knew Steve Cohen from Scholastic when this all started.

07:04.712 --> 07:14.821
And he and several other people at Scholastic fortunately had the vision to see that we had the potential to become something big when they first met us.

07:17.804 --> 07:22.328
And so the mandate that's now over at Scholastic and the person I work with there, Deborah Shaw,

07:23.017 --> 07:25.100
is that they're to help us grow.

07:26.021 --> 07:30.747
And so they actually create and print and mail the catalog.

07:30.787 --> 07:33.311
They warehouse the books, ship the books, are processing.

07:33.331 --> 07:34.192
It's fabulous, isn't it?

07:34.212 --> 07:36.034
It's an incredible gift to us.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.117
And this is your catalog here?

07:38.197 --> 07:40.019
Yes, and I can give you as many copies as you like.

07:40.079 --> 07:40.380
Oh, good.

07:42.082 --> 07:42.282
Excellent.

07:42.302 --> 07:43.864
Terrific.

07:43.884 --> 07:48.130
And this was done to help facilitate the purchase of the books.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.523
Because all they need to do is just send in the order.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.907
We have accounts set up for them there.

07:54.368 --> 07:57.953
The money's taken out of the account, and the books are shipped for free.

07:59.235 --> 08:12.436
And the reason the catalog exists is not only because it saves the medical professionals time, but because a lot of people, you know, PhDs, masters and public bills, were terrified of choosing books for kids.

08:13.337 --> 08:16.682
They just felt, they didn't feel qualified.

08:17.253 --> 08:23.842
So Scholastic was their terrific backlog, a back list of books, and from other publishers as well.

08:24.923 --> 08:26.185
I mean, it was put in.

08:26.205 --> 08:32.934
And in truth, it was done by Pat Cowan, and she still works with us on the camera.

08:32.974 --> 08:34.496
I think I said her name.

08:34.516 --> 08:36.939
Yeah, down there.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.687
And Pat's qualifications, she's got great taste, four kids and a bunch of grandkids.

08:43.966 --> 08:51.515
And every so often, there's this cranky phone call from somebody demanding to know, what professionals do you have vetting this?

08:51.535 --> 08:58.304
So the only use I've gotten on my library degree is to say, I'm qualified.

08:58.324 --> 08:59.706
And I think it's absolutely hilarious.

09:01.107 --> 09:08.016
Well, because you think, certainly it's cause for concern when you think of how people really be challenged.

09:08.266 --> 09:16.555
lists and books that are banned for any number of different opaque reasons?

09:17.136 --> 09:24.243
Oh, I quickly learned in bookselling when I was working for a publisher, they don't even try to sell anything with a witch in it past the Mason-Dixon line.

09:24.724 --> 09:28.929
It's just not going to go.

09:30.811 --> 09:37.598
But they're mostly chosen for the quality of the writing, for

09:38.185 --> 09:40.988
Does it get a reaction on the people?

09:41.028 --> 10:04.952
We're trying to get more of the books that people think of as classics, the Mike Mulligan, the Meg Leith of that one, because what we found is that the residents and the doctors, when they're... When the residents and doctors look at the books when they come in for a reach-out-and-read training, and they start going, I had that when I was a kid.

10:05.202 --> 10:11.809
They get so excited about being able to pass on a childhood favorite to the children they're working with.

10:11.829 --> 10:14.011
It still resonates after all these years.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.612
Oh, definitely.

10:16.753 --> 10:17.394
It's amazing.

10:17.434 --> 10:28.325
You see all these wonderfully educated adults grabbing books out of each other's hands because they had that book when they were a kid, and they have such fond memories of it.

10:28.345 --> 10:33.370
So you're striving for something very fundamental at each level.

10:33.755 --> 10:38.123
And I assume that there's a variety of books that you have at each level.

10:38.283 --> 10:43.673
So that's one book for the six-month-old child and one book for the year-old child.

10:44.415 --> 10:45.116
That's correct.

10:45.136 --> 10:47.540
It's a number of books within each level.

10:47.821 --> 10:53.972
And does this catalog give some sense of how you're progressing from Washington to Sendak in there?

10:53.992 --> 10:54.894
That's great.

10:55.916 --> 10:56.016
Yeah.

10:57.076 --> 11:00.340
the milestones, what children will do with books at different ages.

11:00.641 --> 11:01.181
You do?

11:01.201 --> 11:01.802
In here?

11:01.822 --> 11:03.384
Yeah.

11:03.404 --> 11:03.845
Oh, good.

11:03.865 --> 11:09.793
I wanted to have some materials, and Helen is actually making you copies of some of the others, and we can go through all of them later.

11:09.813 --> 11:11.335
And this is fabulous, too.

11:11.355 --> 11:12.897
I don't have to ask her any titles.

11:12.917 --> 11:13.417
They're all here.

11:13.798 --> 11:18.504
And when you guys are young, will you introduce me to Ron, and then eventually find your way back to me?

11:18.544 --> 11:19.145
This is great.

11:19.165 --> 11:25.032
Thank you.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.374
So what we're trying to

11:26.793 --> 11:47.552
to get the doctors to do is to understand that they can use the book as a developmental tool so that if you see that the mother is taking no interest in the child's excitement over the book, that's telling you that there's a problem between the parent-child bond.

11:48.232 --> 11:54.758
If you have the one-year-old who can't turn the pages with the pincer grip, that's telling you there's a problem.

11:55.244 --> 12:03.733
And it also can help speed up the exam because you need to know, does that three-year-old know how to speak a full sentence?

12:03.753 --> 12:07.096
And a lot of three-year-olds are very shy around the stranger, the doctor now.

12:08.998 --> 12:14.824
And by holding out a book and saying, this looks like a dog and it's really an elephant.

12:14.905 --> 12:15.926
He's got this three-year-old.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.307
That's an elephant.

12:17.647 --> 12:19.990
You know the child can speak a whole sentence.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.973
See, what really pleases me about this is that

12:23.594 --> 12:31.631
and I don't think this is apparent in a lot of the stories that you see about the program, is that it's just as useful to the physician as it is to the kid.

12:33.495 --> 12:43.375
It's really a diagnostic tool for the physician, because you're assessing performance and response and measuring that against

12:43.456 --> 12:46.099
what others are doing, and I hadn't even thought of that.

12:46.119 --> 12:53.647
I thought it was really kind of a one-way thing where you're helping, you're really promoting literacy and reading, because that is a good thing, but it goes well beyond that.

12:54.588 --> 13:04.539
Yes, and one of the really great things is, in a lot of cases, it's the chance for the doctor to say something terrific about the kid, the parent.

13:07.242 --> 13:12.248
Many of our trainers will teach the other doctors how to say,

13:12.329 --> 13:14.492
Look how your child is reacting to that book.

13:14.552 --> 13:15.573
He is so bright.

13:17.855 --> 13:20.699
And it's a positive interaction.

13:21.860 --> 13:28.969
And it's a chance to do something that makes a difference other than does your child wear a helmet and they're riding a bike?

13:29.729 --> 13:31.772
Fire safety, do you have a gun in the house?

13:31.792 --> 13:33.153
Those just aren't fun interactions.

13:33.834 --> 13:34.735
This is fun for them.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.438
And the kids become really used to getting the books.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.184
And there's one doctor in New York who actually will write

13:42.721 --> 13:45.325
the child's name and his name into the book.

13:45.345 --> 13:46.226
Oh, that's wonderful.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.749
And the child is so flattered.

13:49.711 --> 13:51.774
It's almost like he's inscribing a copy of the book.

13:51.794 --> 13:52.254
Well, he is.

13:52.475 --> 13:54.097
It is a gift, isn't it?

13:54.117 --> 14:04.271
Yes, and because the doctor is important in the eyes of the parent, the child realizes that this very important person is writing his name and the child's name.

14:04.291 --> 14:06.013
I hadn't thought of this.

14:06.254 --> 14:10.720
Does the book come as a gift, or is it something in another context?

14:11.442 --> 14:18.150
Well, the way it's supposed to work is when the doctor enters the exam room, he's supposed to have an age-appropriate book in his hand.

14:19.432 --> 14:24.798
And sometimes if they're really good at it, they'll have one or two or three books so the child can make a choice.

14:26.120 --> 14:33.388
And so it is given as a gift in the beginning rather than just out here as you're leaving sort of thing.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.010
Like the lollipop.

14:35.351 --> 14:35.931
Yeah, exactly.

14:36.352 --> 14:38.054
Because you've been a good kid.

14:38.074 --> 14:38.214
Mm-hmm.

14:38.234 --> 14:38.775
Yeah.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.257
So the child gets a chance.

14:40.277 --> 14:40.937
It's not a reward.

14:41.298 --> 14:41.398
Yeah.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.314
I guess maybe that's the better word.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.477
Is it regarded as a reward or no?

14:46.998 --> 14:47.158
No.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.503
It's an essential element of the process, right?

14:50.964 --> 14:57.674
Yes, and it's almost perceived as a, I'm so glad to have you here, I brought you something.

14:58.495 --> 15:00.138
And the kids really enjoy it.

15:00.178 --> 15:00.699
And it's a book.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.321
Wow, isn't that wonderful?

15:03.763 --> 15:04.204
Yes.

15:04.224 --> 15:06.387
And I'll have to give you Robert's email address.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.449
Nobody explains it.

15:07.729 --> 15:10.153
Harry does a great job explaining it.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.402
This is Robert who now?

15:12.422 --> 15:12.922
Needleman.

15:13.002 --> 15:13.543
Yes, I'd love to.

15:13.563 --> 15:15.785
I'd love to touch with him.

15:16.506 --> 15:18.388
I have my notebook in a minute.

15:18.468 --> 15:19.529
Oh, that's Robert.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.411
But maybe you can do some e-mail.

15:22.212 --> 15:22.912
Yeah, okay.

15:22.932 --> 15:23.953
I'd be happy to.

15:23.973 --> 15:24.334
Good.

15:24.354 --> 15:24.954
I'll e-mail you.

15:25.235 --> 15:27.257
Actually, yeah, you're here.

15:27.477 --> 15:28.638
Okay.

15:28.858 --> 15:29.079
Yeah.

15:29.699 --> 15:37.407
Robert is... He started this as a resident of Boston Medical Center.

15:37.977 --> 15:43.966
And he was reading to his daughter at home, and he just wanted the opportunity for all the children to have books.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.769
Is he the gentleman who now went to Cleveland?

15:45.789 --> 15:46.290
Is that right?

15:46.330 --> 15:46.951
Yes.

15:46.971 --> 15:49.415
I'm sure I mentioned him there, too.

15:49.435 --> 15:55.043
But it's especially fun to watch Robert talk about his interactions with the kids.

15:55.063 --> 15:58.669
Now, is he doing it out there as well now, or has he...?

15:58.689 --> 16:00.572
Robert spends a fair amount of time traveling.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.276
Tomorrow he's in New York City doing a talk.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.441
about the love of reading.

16:05.942 --> 16:08.926
Can you just write that email address on the back of your card for me?

16:08.946 --> 16:09.366
Yeah, sure.

16:09.386 --> 16:18.598
If you don't mind it.

16:18.618 --> 16:21.181
He just wrote, oh, he's the, I have that.

16:21.482 --> 16:21.842
Oh, you do?

16:21.902 --> 16:22.503
The eighth edition?

16:22.683 --> 16:24.405
Well, I get, I get review books.

16:25.106 --> 16:29.652
And, and that's actually one of the books I've set aside as an important book.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.281
It doesn't have to be a work of literature.

16:33.401 --> 16:38.187
It can even be the Sears-Robot catalog as an influential book.

16:40.990 --> 16:44.314
I'm going to give you his home number, too.

16:44.434 --> 16:44.895
Terrific.

16:45.936 --> 16:47.998
He's much easier to reach at home than he is.

16:48.479 --> 16:54.646
He's only working part-time as a physician, and the rest of the time he's either wandering the country talking for us.

16:56.087 --> 16:58.390
Well, then I have to talk to him.

16:58.927 --> 17:04.493
He's a very beloved speaker around here.

17:04.513 --> 17:04.933
Excellent.

17:06.615 --> 17:12.521
And he put a chapter into the exhibition of the Spock book about reading a lot.

17:12.581 --> 17:22.011
And actually, I can probably, if you leave me your email address, I know Robert's talk tomorrow in New York City.

17:22.091 --> 17:26.716
He forwarded the PowerPoint to them, and I can get a copy and forward it to you.

17:26.876 --> 17:27.077
N.A.

17:27.097 --> 17:28.478
Baz Baines at AOL.

17:28.812 --> 17:40.723
Very simple, but don't forget the A. There's also nickandgentlymad.com, which is my website.

17:40.743 --> 17:42.305
It's kind of fun.

17:42.365 --> 17:43.286
It's a pretty good website.

17:43.306 --> 17:48.491
It's still being developed, but I get a lot of things in there, reviews for the books.

17:49.171 --> 17:52.695
I'm going to put up a lot of new literary essays.

17:52.715 --> 17:55.698
I just time, time is the thing.

17:55.718 --> 17:56.578
This is great.

17:56.598 --> 17:57.199
Excellent.

17:57.533 --> 18:01.579
So let me tell you about how publishers send me review copies.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.024
Harcourt just sent me a package today.

18:05.945 --> 18:09.150
And sometimes I'm horrified at what they send me.

18:10.491 --> 18:13.716
And sometimes I'm abused.

18:14.557 --> 18:17.161
And what I like, I pass around to get some other opinions.

18:17.381 --> 18:18.463
Pat looks up and through.

18:19.104 --> 18:25.633
And then Deborah Shaw with the classic starts doing the dirty work of negotiating discounts.

18:25.917 --> 18:31.790
You're talking hundreds of copies, aren't you?

18:31.850 --> 18:38.104
If we buy the stock directly from the publisher, it usually starts at about 2,500 books.

18:38.388 --> 18:43.253
But a lot of times we try to see if we can negotiate the book club rights as well.

18:43.313 --> 18:46.557
That's what you should, your title to that, I don't think.

18:46.577 --> 18:47.658
Yeah, as well, it's cheaper, too.

18:47.898 --> 18:49.921
Say I like them on that scale.

18:49.941 --> 18:50.481
Yes.

18:50.561 --> 18:52.303
As an author, you must be thrilled.

18:52.323 --> 18:57.869
Well, as you probably know from the publishers, you might be a little more aware than most authors.

18:58.851 --> 19:00.532
Publishers keep their authors in the dark.

19:00.552 --> 19:03.396
I don't have a clue as to what Splendor Letters is sold.

19:04.517 --> 19:05.698
Except I know it's done very well.

19:05.838 --> 19:08.361
Nobody's complained about it.

19:08.662 --> 19:10.806
But I have no idea.

19:11.046 --> 19:13.931
I was signing in Indiana at the Lilly Library.

19:15.734 --> 19:18.238
And somebody said, well, how many editions of Gentle Madness are there?

19:18.259 --> 19:22.265
I said, well, eight hardcovers and at least three of the paperbacks.

19:22.285 --> 19:23.508
And they don't really look pretty.

19:23.568 --> 19:27.695
Well, yeah, but I do look, and I just see why I opened up the paperback.

19:27.715 --> 19:29.378
It was the sixth paperback edition.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.902
You know, it's very easily discernible.

19:32.287 --> 19:33.228
I didn't know it.

19:33.268 --> 19:34.169
Holt never told me.

19:34.189 --> 19:36.010
I mean, so that's 14 printings of a book.

19:36.330 --> 19:45.979
But I didn't know that until I looked into, you know, I said, well, I hope they got the corrections in that sense, because they're beautiful things that I want to get in there.

19:46.880 --> 19:46.980
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.701
No, I had, um... They never tell you.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.963
No, it... They don't want to tell you.

19:50.983 --> 19:51.784
Well, that's very true.

19:51.804 --> 19:56.208
I mean, a lot of times they just don't have the people to surround and chat with the authors as much as they might like to.

19:56.788 --> 20:01.332
But a lot of times it's done to save the publisher the aggravation.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.854
Sometimes knowledge is a dangerous thing.

20:03.874 --> 20:07.359
Well, the way I find out is I buy copies of my own books.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.565
And so the woman I deal with, and I say, well, what have we got?

20:12.585 --> 20:14.708
She'll tell me how many you've got in the warehouse.

20:14.808 --> 20:15.909
And I go, well, how have we done?

20:17.451 --> 20:19.814
And I'm not supposed to tell you that.

20:19.834 --> 20:24.780
I say, well, come on, you can tell me I'm buying 100 copies, about 60 copies or whatever.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.725
And so I'll tell you, but it's the agent, you're right.

20:28.745 --> 20:30.267
I say, hey, they told you how many you've done.

20:30.287 --> 20:31.268
I mean, he doesn't know either.

20:31.383 --> 20:31.884
Oh, no.

20:31.904 --> 20:34.447
You know, because you get the royalty statements every six months.

20:35.469 --> 20:40.656
And whatever you sell, they will hold out 40% for returns.

20:40.957 --> 20:46.104
And I never had a 40% return, but that doesn't get factored into your statement.

20:46.985 --> 20:47.326
Oh, yeah.

20:47.386 --> 20:53.434
So the trick is to get it as much of an advance as you can.

20:53.534 --> 20:56.859
I never believed that when I started writing.

20:56.879 --> 20:57.961
Whenever I sell, I'll learn.

20:58.742 --> 21:00.985
But I've now learned over a period of years

21:01.235 --> 21:02.757
absolutely get as much as you can.

21:03.118 --> 21:04.180
Oh, front of us.

21:04.200 --> 21:04.500
Oh, yeah.

21:05.983 --> 21:08.988
And then I figured that's what you're kind of getting paid, you know?

21:09.008 --> 21:09.248
Yeah.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.475
No, I've had, I was once when I was working over Kate's Mystery Books.

21:13.495 --> 21:15.118
I pretty much worked everywhere in New England.

21:17.802 --> 21:27.698
This very sweet young kid who had just written a mystery with Little Brown came in, and I was stripping paperbacks that day, and he wanted to talk about

21:27.931 --> 21:29.313
you know, having a sign and a cake.

21:29.393 --> 21:30.294
So I told him, sit down.

21:30.334 --> 21:32.037
I handed him a bunch of books and started stripping.

21:32.998 --> 21:38.225
And I gave him a crash course in a hard life of being an author.

21:38.245 --> 21:39.647
And he was just horrified.

21:40.008 --> 21:43.693
And he said, I didn't realize there was so many things they never tell me.

21:45.636 --> 21:46.898
They drive you crazy.

21:46.918 --> 21:49.962
But I have to say, getting, like I said, getting world things on that book.

21:49.982 --> 21:50.903
I'm going to be 10 years old.

21:51.965 --> 21:55.429
Because I've got like a nothing, a chance not to begin with.

21:55.449 --> 21:56.571
Whatever it earns and earns.

21:56.804 --> 21:59.628
But you never have a clue.

21:59.708 --> 22:05.957
And then it'll be like you get something, you get a statement in May, but that's for the period that ended in December.

22:05.977 --> 22:14.830
And I know I had a good... Oh, and the deals that are cut, it's not... Most people don't realize it's not just, you know, you go to a bookstore,

22:15.029 --> 22:15.971
You buy the book.

22:15.991 --> 22:20.518
And the author gets 10 or 15 percent or everything.

22:20.899 --> 22:26.548
It's all tied into what market the book was sold in, what discount was given out on that particular sale.

22:26.569 --> 22:27.490
That's why I'm with Hoppers.

22:27.971 --> 22:34.181
I was going to go biking after Alice Holtz, and it was a very complicated deal.

22:34.502 --> 22:41.053
I mean, if they sell to Amazon, X number, or Barnes & Noble, then my

22:41.843 --> 22:47.389
I mean, the royalty goes down proportionally, and we adamantly oppose that.

22:47.409 --> 22:56.618
I mean, 15 percent, I mean, it's a pittance to begin with, and whatever deal you make selling a book, fine, but I shouldn't have to.

22:57.439 --> 23:01.123
The Harpers did give us, I have to say, a very clean, straight deal.

23:01.143 --> 23:05.668
Yeah, but by the time you got to Harvard, you had already taken a few lessons.

23:06.609 --> 23:11.614
Well, yeah, I was leaving Holt to go to

23:12.050 --> 23:16.875
following an editor at Viking, and they made a generous offer.

23:17.535 --> 23:25.383
But then it was just fraught with all of these different provisions that made it less interesting.

23:25.423 --> 23:29.987
And then Hoppers heard that I was available, and they came in and said they got more money.

23:30.007 --> 23:34.091
And they had a very clean deal, and they had to buy me out of hope.

23:34.151 --> 23:37.194
It was just wonderful.

23:37.214 --> 23:37.855
It was just freedom.

23:38.189 --> 23:40.893
And I liked Holt, but everybody I worked with had gone.

23:42.054 --> 23:42.335
Yeah.

23:43.136 --> 23:44.298
And I was an orphan twice.

23:45.699 --> 23:47.903
By the time my second book came out, I had nine editors.

23:48.483 --> 23:48.684
Oh, yeah.

23:48.704 --> 23:49.845
I'm not surprised.

23:49.865 --> 23:50.706
You know, nine editors.

23:51.448 --> 23:57.877
And now I've had the same guy for the last three books, which is you, Van Dusen, and I do.

23:57.897 --> 23:59.298
I hope I stay with him forever.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.543
I'm sorry for going off on you folks.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.502
I mean, this is not even the worst example I've had recently.

24:06.742 --> 24:08.104
This came in yesterday.

24:09.066 --> 24:15.756
And what I can't get a lot of publishers, especially... And this is teeth, they're not for biting today, to be clear.

24:16.437 --> 24:26.232
Well, what I can't get a lot of the publishers to understand, it's worse with the smaller ones, but I still have a hard time with the bigger ones, is that Reach Out and Read just has good storybooks.

24:26.572 --> 24:31.500
I mean, I would not read teeth or not for biting for a bedtime story.

24:31.902 --> 24:34.627
This is not a book that an adult is going to go in 20 years.

24:34.907 --> 24:35.589
I have that book.

24:35.829 --> 24:36.270
Yeah.

24:36.290 --> 24:39.936
My wife and I do a monthly review of children's books from the newspaper.

24:39.956 --> 24:40.718
Oh.

24:40.738 --> 24:42.341
And we just rejected one yesterday.

24:42.361 --> 24:43.523
It was on the same.

24:44.505 --> 24:47.149
It looked quite well done, but it was stinky, smelly feet.

24:47.891 --> 24:49.634
My friend has sticky, smelly feet.

24:50.956 --> 24:51.838
So what are we teaching?

24:51.878 --> 24:52.820
What's the point here?

24:52.900 --> 24:55.885
You know, I mean, I guess you like someone despite whatever they are.

24:56.135 --> 25:04.424
I can see where they're going with it, but as you say, is it something that I'd enjoy reading to my kid at NIDER, and is it one that would resonate over a period of years?

25:05.325 --> 25:06.086
I don't think so.

25:06.967 --> 25:09.230
So it didn't make the cut.

25:09.250 --> 25:13.434
There's such a Puritan streak in the people of the U.S.

25:13.935 --> 25:21.083
We cannot allow a child to just enjoy a book unless it is teaching them, teaching someone's lesson.

25:21.544 --> 25:25.568
Because I'm forever fending off the... But it teaches...

25:25.953 --> 25:27.995
moral to teach us character.

25:29.197 --> 25:33.281
We're in a whole new age of children's books.

25:33.301 --> 25:40.489
That was the original kids' book, where it did have that moral didactic function, I guess.

25:40.509 --> 25:43.272
But what's wrong with just enjoying the book and being amused by it?

25:44.694 --> 25:47.837
And if you pick up a little something, that's great.

25:48.438 --> 25:50.340
I know when I'm doing these reviews,

25:51.704 --> 26:03.418
Most people, most reviewers, they're looking for, if you look at the library journal reviews in particular, well, this is good for this and that and that and just learn about the importance of bond.

26:03.438 --> 26:06.022
Do you think a kid is really picking that up?

26:06.202 --> 26:14.832
I'd hope so, but I think if I'm writing a children's book, that's not really what I'm trying to do.

26:15.133 --> 26:18.657
I hope to write about half a dozen kids' books, by the way.

26:19.177 --> 26:20.499
I know exactly what they're going to be.

26:20.519 --> 26:22.642
I shouldn't have this one.

26:22.662 --> 26:25.226
I have to transcribe.

26:25.246 --> 26:43.834
So you're just talking again about books that have a power to... Well, children, because there's so much computers, TV, whatever, children aren't told or shown in any real way the power that books can have

26:44.219 --> 26:47.262
the whole thrust of this book I'm writing, by the way, so you can see.

26:47.282 --> 26:51.986
But not just the Lincoln book, but also the book that we're talking about here.

26:52.006 --> 26:53.467
How books affect people's lives.

26:53.487 --> 26:54.788
I say books have changed the world.

26:54.808 --> 26:59.212
But if you change one person with a book, that's why the title Every Book It's Reader is not bad.

27:00.433 --> 27:02.315
A book can reach one person.

27:03.315 --> 27:09.080
But if that one person had examples of that, I think you know.

27:09.581 --> 27:13.264
Oh, there are plenty of examples out there of people

27:14.020 --> 27:16.002
finding the right book at the right moment.

27:17.063 --> 27:19.185
Do you think?

27:19.206 --> 27:21.328
Can you think of anything off the top of your head?

27:22.389 --> 27:25.873
I'm really looking for examples, by the way.

27:25.893 --> 27:43.251
Well, my friend Anne Nawawi, who's just an incredible woman, she's a retired librarian, and it's not a major example, but at a point in her life where she was terrified, I think, if I remember the story correctly, she was

27:43.720 --> 27:46.965
being forced to learn how to swim, much against her will.

27:48.146 --> 28:01.705
And instead of doing some sort of bibliotherapy about a book on not being afraid to swim, I can't even remember what book it was she was reading, but it was about somebody facing much worse.

28:03.467 --> 28:09.656
And she realized, if he could do this, it was a biography I remember that much, I can learn how to swim.

28:09.816 --> 28:12.580
So she overcame her phobia about the water.

28:13.066 --> 28:17.652
because she was reading this particular book.

28:18.914 --> 28:27.185
I, let's see, for me, I lost my husband very young.

28:29.208 --> 28:36.157
And, I'm sorry I'm so bad with the title, the worst possible moments.

28:36.257 --> 28:38.080
Don't mess the word, it will come.

28:39.041 --> 28:39.141
Okay.

28:42.597 --> 28:44.880
They made a movie out of it.

28:46.082 --> 28:48.285
Rock Hudson, who was a semi-dreadful in it.

28:48.405 --> 28:51.689
Jane Weinman.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.792
But it had an impact on you, obviously.

28:53.812 --> 28:56.035
It had a critical moment.

28:56.295 --> 28:58.679
It was a story about a woman who lost her husband.

28:59.620 --> 29:00.701
All that heaven allows, that's it.

29:01.042 --> 29:01.462
Say it again?

29:01.723 --> 29:03.025
All that heaven allows.

29:03.285 --> 29:12.317
And it was the book of the film that... Well, when I discovered... I'd seen the film about Rock Hudson was dreadful and not given any thought until I happened to notice...

29:12.972 --> 29:14.474
that it was based on a book.

29:15.455 --> 29:19.220
So I tracked down a copy of the book, going through three library systems to do so.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.322
It's from the 50s.

29:21.924 --> 29:26.369
And I read it in the ninth chapter.

29:26.429 --> 29:40.768
There's this one paragraph about why, after everybody assumed that life should have been moving on and she should be just fine, stop your grieving, hurry up attitude from other people.

29:41.288 --> 29:43.030
The year is up or whatever.

29:43.070 --> 29:43.310
Yes.

29:43.791 --> 29:44.252
Oh, yes.

29:44.412 --> 29:46.154
It seems to be the day after the anniversary.

29:46.174 --> 29:47.696
People want you moving on.

29:48.777 --> 29:49.077
Exactly.

29:49.658 --> 30:02.954
This one paragraph touched me so much about why she was still grieving that I went out and found a copy of this book, which was not an easy thing to do, even in today's age.

30:03.695 --> 30:10.283
And even though it's a second edition with no jacket, nobody's taking this book from me.

30:11.427 --> 30:12.809
All That Heaven Allows.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.711
And it's a novel, or it's a...?

30:14.731 --> 30:15.572
It's a novel.

30:15.632 --> 30:16.693
It's a novel.

30:16.713 --> 30:16.973
Yeah.

30:18.895 --> 30:23.340
And it was just... I was really surprised.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.501
It's written by a husband and wife.

30:25.843 --> 30:26.924
As a work of fiction?

30:27.104 --> 30:27.224
Yeah.

30:27.244 --> 30:28.946
Which is very unusual, isn't it?

30:28.966 --> 30:29.767
It's collaborative.

30:30.568 --> 30:30.688
Yes.

30:30.708 --> 30:36.154
Although, from the writing, I suspect the wife did most of it.

30:36.174 --> 30:36.274
Yeah.

30:36.294 --> 30:38.937
Well, anyway, that's... I'd love to do about five.

30:39.220 --> 30:44.786
I write, you know, I'm committed to literacy.

30:45.788 --> 30:49.211
We write, we've been doing children's book reviews for five years together.

30:49.252 --> 30:50.773
I've been doing it myself longer.

30:52.035 --> 30:52.796
Why not?

30:53.817 --> 30:54.437
It's kind of fun.

30:54.478 --> 31:03.608
I think, you know, it's a nice, tight picture book.

31:03.655 --> 31:08.422
It's just kind of a, I guess, writing it in a way that's accessible, but it's not writing down.

31:08.502 --> 31:10.686
It's really an enormous challenge to me.

31:10.906 --> 31:15.834
I mean, I can write 500,000 words a day if I have to, which is usually my pace.

31:17.296 --> 31:20.360
But this one I've been toying with for five years.

31:21.883 --> 31:24.387
I think it's much harder to write for children.

31:24.407 --> 31:24.947
Oh, I think so.

31:25.488 --> 31:28.553
Maurice Sendak takes forever to do a little 300-word book.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.058
But look at it, every word totally matters.

31:32.419 --> 31:32.599
Yeah.

31:32.967 --> 31:36.252
And I'd like to do that one.

31:36.272 --> 31:48.189
I'd like to do one on Phyllis, you know, going before that board to find out where she was, this African-American woman, slave, actually capable of writing.

31:48.209 --> 31:52.996
How is this former Aborigine, as they described her?

31:53.016 --> 31:55.079
What would that meaning have been like?

31:55.139 --> 31:59.626
That book of poems that comes out of that, you know, so you've got a nice little book there.

31:59.686 --> 32:02.350
James Logan, I wrote about him, Gentle Madness.

32:02.667 --> 32:08.701
Penns, William Penns I, a representative, a great bibliophile, a brilliant man.

32:09.523 --> 32:11.167
He had to leave all of his books behind.

32:11.227 --> 32:18.503
He came here in 1699, and there was one book that was driving him nuts over 30 years, and he finally wrote to their agent in Ireland.

32:18.543 --> 32:19.225
It's in General Madness.

32:19.610 --> 32:22.494
And they found the book in the bookstore, 25 years, still there.

32:23.355 --> 32:24.397
And then it's returned to him.

32:24.437 --> 32:26.159
It takes a year and a half to get to him.

32:26.179 --> 32:28.403
And he writes in it in Latin, the rarest book.

32:28.423 --> 32:30.045
And I've handled that book.

32:30.526 --> 32:31.427
What a great story.

32:31.447 --> 32:38.778
This is probably the only owner of a first edition Algonquin Bible, the Indian, Elliot's Indian Bible.

32:38.818 --> 32:40.300
Read it in the Indian language.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.122
Because he had Indians in his house.

32:42.803 --> 32:44.205
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant man.

32:44.626 --> 32:45.988
And his library becomes a lot.

32:46.508 --> 32:53.380
The Library Company of Philadelphia and all that, and Benjamin Franklin wrote his obituary.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.048
But I think that one book, again, that one book story, I'm obsessed.

32:58.068 --> 32:59.631
He's the guy who said, Books are my disease.

33:01.274 --> 33:03.337
That could be the title of that, too, couldn't it?

33:03.357 --> 33:04.499
That would be a great book title.

33:04.780 --> 33:05.561
Don't you think?

33:05.581 --> 33:05.842
Oh, yeah.

33:05.902 --> 33:10.189
Books are my... There were so many of us who would understand that one.

33:10.209 --> 33:11.672
There were plain titles there.

33:12.277 --> 33:13.238
I'm sorry.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.123
I'm cursing myself when I go to read.

33:17.143 --> 33:20.387
I'm listening to myself talk on the tape.

33:20.407 --> 33:24.251
But anyway, so we're talking, oh, that's a nice book.

33:24.271 --> 33:25.693
You're welcome to have that copy if you like.

33:25.753 --> 33:31.340
This is something I would love to be able to get from Houghton Misselin for our own catalog.

33:31.780 --> 33:34.344
But right now, the cost would be too much for us.

33:34.944 --> 33:39.570
But if I commissioned someone to do a book for us, this is what I would have asked them.

33:39.590 --> 33:40.931
And this is, we're talking about book.

33:41.292 --> 33:41.372
Yes.

33:41.774 --> 33:42.995
It's a great Hilton Mifflin title.

33:43.496 --> 33:43.976
Yeah.

33:43.996 --> 33:45.558
And it is how old?

33:46.098 --> 33:47.560
Probably two years old now.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.461
Oh, this is great.

33:49.481 --> 33:52.905
And the sales rep over there knows I want this.

33:53.525 --> 33:59.331
And when it's gotten to a point where they're willing to... How about you ascribe this to me?

34:00.512 --> 34:00.953
You don't mind?

34:01.373 --> 34:02.154
Well, it's not my book.

34:02.614 --> 34:04.676
Well, you're giving it to me as a gift.

34:04.916 --> 34:05.717
Reach out and read.

34:05.737 --> 34:06.618
That would be kind of nice.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.481
See the kind of thing that I collect.

34:10.542 --> 34:10.802
All right.

34:11.508 --> 34:13.010
Well, just as a gift.

34:16.735 --> 34:17.816
Is it cost?

34:17.856 --> 34:18.978
It's cost.

34:18.998 --> 34:40.165
We offer a very significant discount for our books because in our start-up application, we tell people to determine their budget by multiplying $2.50 by number of well-child visits between the ages of six months and five years, and then we give them a grant based on that budget.

34:40.769 --> 34:45.396
Unfortunately, it's very hard to find books to put in our catalog that are $2.50.

34:46.177 --> 34:49.462
Most of them are $3 or $3.85.

34:50.224 --> 34:55.712
We try to keep the cost down, but books are expensive, which is part of the reason a lot of people don't own books.

34:55.872 --> 34:59.979
So this one lists for $10.99.

35:00.099 --> 35:04.125
So you're probably trying to get it for, and that isn't enough.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.667
I'm just curious.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.350
We would ask for an 80% discount.

35:07.853 --> 35:12.378
If I were the author, I'd do it in a second, see, if they asked me to do it.

35:12.398 --> 35:14.261
What great a gesture could you do?

35:15.762 --> 35:16.844
Well, the 

35:18.446 --> 35:19.227
Potents are tough for you to work with.

35:19.247 --> 35:19.447
Yes.

35:19.467 --> 35:25.494
What we're trying to do, Deborah, Charles, Pat Cohen, and I, is to go after the publishers.

35:26.595 --> 35:28.798
Pat and I go in and sock them up with our

35:29.116 --> 35:30.257
We're going to reach out and read.

35:30.277 --> 35:30.597
We're wonderful.

35:30.617 --> 35:32.359
And this is a pro-boto kind of thing, too.

35:32.379 --> 35:34.241
I mean... Well, they'll make money off of us.

35:34.261 --> 35:35.482
They will, too, absolutely.

35:35.502 --> 35:38.746
You know, when they sell books on the Remainers, they sell them for $3 or something.

35:39.166 --> 35:46.593
My books, you know, or the Patients and Fortitude, they... I said, it's not out of print, but it's in the trading back.

35:46.613 --> 35:48.195
But you can buy what we're selling.

35:48.215 --> 35:50.417
I said, I don't want you selling any of these high cameras.

35:50.457 --> 35:51.178
I'll buy them all.

35:51.999 --> 35:52.980
I just don't want them.

35:53.080 --> 35:56.423
It offends me that you're selling them for $3.48.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.845
Yes, and I'm finding them in supermarkets at $7.98.

35:58.865 --> 36:03.852
Yeah, really, and I'll buy them, and I'll give them to people, which is what I saw for several hundred.

36:04.733 --> 36:08.018
But at $3.42, they're making money.

36:08.719 --> 36:09.400
Yes, they are.

36:09.420 --> 36:11.023
That's my point, isn't it?

36:11.043 --> 36:17.753
And that's a big $35 book that's 600-and-something pages with two signatures of photographs in it.

36:17.969 --> 36:20.912
And sheets, and the whole works, and a gorgeous dust jacket.

36:21.693 --> 36:25.137
And if they can put us across them, 50 cents to make a book, a dollar?

36:25.557 --> 36:26.859
Yeah, it depends on the description.

36:26.879 --> 36:28.120
Yeah, what is this, down in China?

36:28.140 --> 36:28.460
I'll bet.

36:29.041 --> 36:29.642
Yeah, probably.

36:29.662 --> 36:30.282
Singapore?

36:30.883 --> 36:33.506
Yeah.

36:33.526 --> 36:35.888
It doesn't tell us, anyway.

36:35.908 --> 36:36.289
Right.

36:36.309 --> 36:37.390
Well, it's someplace here.

36:37.730 --> 36:37.931
Yeah.

36:37.991 --> 36:39.492
No, but Singapore is always a good guess.

36:39.512 --> 36:40.173
Singapore is a good guess.

36:40.193 --> 36:41.795
The Chinese are doing so now.

36:41.815 --> 36:43.757
I knew Eric Carle came in yesterday.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.411
It was done in China.

36:46.451 --> 36:52.195
They did a fabulous job on the color separation.

36:52.681 --> 36:57.667
I was at the book fair when his very quiet cricket came out, the first book of the computer chip.

36:57.687 --> 36:58.929
Was that fun?

36:59.029 --> 37:03.094
It was fun, but they hadn't quite gotten the technology of the computer chip yet.

37:03.114 --> 37:03.655
Yeah, it goes off.

37:03.915 --> 37:04.716
You're just carrying it.

37:04.736 --> 37:05.657
It goes off, you know?

37:05.898 --> 37:10.203
So imagine 20 cartons of that book chirping at you.

37:11.184 --> 37:12.867
I love that.

37:12.887 --> 37:14.589
Did you go to the book expo?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.191
I haven't gone in a couple of years.

37:16.311 --> 37:18.013
I go to it when it's in New York.

37:17.993 --> 37:19.995
Well, it's been in Chicago.

37:20.556 --> 37:26.422
I always scare people because I walk into the booth and they'll say, I work for a literacy organization.

37:26.502 --> 37:27.183
I'm a salesperson.

37:27.403 --> 37:29.746
Yeah, because they figure you're looking for handouts, right?

37:29.926 --> 37:32.649
Yeah, so my second sentence is, we buy the books.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.292
Oh, great.

37:35.312 --> 37:36.713
Well, that might be nice of you giving this.

37:37.034 --> 37:39.536
I hope I didn't deprive you of your copy.

37:39.837 --> 37:40.938
No, I have a second copy.

37:40.958 --> 37:41.959
That's very kind.

37:41.979 --> 37:42.740
Thank you.

37:42.760 --> 37:47.545
Yeah, so it's mostly a matter of money, and

37:47.693 --> 37:49.716
of getting the books we want.

37:49.736 --> 37:51.458
And most of your funding comes from where?

37:51.638 --> 37:52.099
Is it?

37:52.259 --> 37:54.482
Federal, state, grants.

37:54.562 --> 37:56.404
We'll take money from pretty much anyone.

37:56.765 --> 37:58.247
And how large is the staff here?

37:58.968 --> 38:01.531
It's 20 full-time, part-time people.

38:01.551 --> 38:06.718
And this is the national headquarters, of course, so you're buying, basically, for everyone.

38:06.738 --> 38:09.501
Well, they choose one book.

38:09.521 --> 38:14.848
And then we have some people who really love to wheel and deal with the publishers, and they go off and do their own thing.

38:14.980 --> 38:21.890
If they fundraise money of their own or if they choose the reimbursement option, they can go buy the books whatever they like.

38:22.111 --> 38:28.300
But I would say 98% of people choose to have a prepaid account sent up.

38:30.023 --> 38:40.078
And now that the economy has taken, took a downturn, I need to be pursued by publishers who just want to be part of it.

38:40.098 --> 38:43.603
Because as we get larger and better known, people are realizing

38:44.326 --> 38:47.571
They give away three million books a year.

38:48.432 --> 38:49.954
We need to be part of this.

38:50.695 --> 38:51.336
This is a market.

38:51.396 --> 38:56.704
It's astonishing that it's taken them so long to discern that.

38:57.105 --> 39:05.457
Well, publishers are still very much in the mindset of we deal with bookstores.

39:06.365 --> 39:09.969
And so they're still calling it special sales when it's outside of a bookstore.

39:09.989 --> 39:11.551
Yeah, and it doesn't even count in your numbers.

39:11.571 --> 39:18.178
I mean, for the author, I'll bet the author really gets stung on that a little bit.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.501
But for this, I wouldn't mind.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.204
We'd hope to get something out of it.

39:23.644 --> 39:24.185
Oh, yeah.

39:24.205 --> 39:32.194
And I wouldn't want to deprive an author or a publisher of making a profit on the book, because that means they get to publish the next book.

39:32.334 --> 39:32.594
Sure.

39:33.575 --> 39:36.118
But shall we scare them off a little bit?

39:36.470 --> 39:39.995
by walking in and saying 80%.

39:40.015 --> 39:48.726
We negotiate a bit, and if we can find out if they're doing a print run of the book we want, we'll pack our order onto it, and that makes it a little bit easier.

39:48.746 --> 39:53.792
80%, when you think about it, it's not that bad, because there's no distributor that they're paying.

39:53.872 --> 39:55.114
There's no bookstore.

39:55.855 --> 40:01.021
And so their margin is really not going to be, it's going to be a difference of 10 or 15%, maybe.

40:01.362 --> 40:02.003
And no returns.

40:02.083 --> 40:02.804
And no returns.

40:04.065 --> 40:05.447
How can you possibly beat that?

40:05.630 --> 40:06.952
It's pretty good, actually.

40:07.253 --> 40:14.505
Well, the part that makes it difficult for them is because the purchase order is coming from Scholastic.

40:14.525 --> 40:14.666
Mm-hmm.

40:14.686 --> 40:26.927
And even though publishing is a very interactive business with other publishers, the idea of having to sell to Scholastic at that discount just... Yeah, I know.

40:26.987 --> 40:30.172
But they see your numbers, so it has to have... Yeah.

40:30.192 --> 40:31.114
Anyway, they'll come around.

40:31.516 --> 40:36.581
Yeah, so they start smelling the money, and I actually just had to call off one of the publishers.

40:38.363 --> 40:45.651
They read in our newsletter about a huge grant that our person up in Alaska thought.

40:45.671 --> 40:49.134
And so the next thing I know is this guy's following me.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.376
Do you know anything about this?

40:51.417 --> 40:52.658
And he's naming the publisher to me.

40:53.679 --> 41:01.067
I just got this thing about buying books from them, and Paul doesn't know anything about purchasing books.

41:01.385 --> 41:09.976
He was just going to deal with us and Scholastic because we have a way of dealing with very huge, very big purchases.

41:11.578 --> 41:20.590
And I was a little bit nipped because I had told the sales rep, if you do anything big, I need to know about it.

41:20.870 --> 41:23.554
And so I called her and she was a little surprised.

41:23.714 --> 41:26.858
And I had to tell her, this is not a big universe.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.081
Especially the book world.

41:29.101 --> 41:30.683
There's such a cottage industry as that.

41:30.832 --> 41:32.595
Everybody knows what's going on.

41:32.975 --> 41:40.085
Yes, um, Harry actually met Harriet Zefert, who's got her own publishing company now.

41:40.105 --> 41:41.387
Had to talk.

41:41.407 --> 41:42.329
That's her husband.

41:42.469 --> 41:43.771
That's Harriet's husband.

41:43.791 --> 41:44.552
Oh, that's funny.

41:45.353 --> 41:47.136
No, they just started their own publishing company.

41:47.176 --> 41:48.898
That's cute.

41:48.918 --> 41:50.701
Yeah.

41:50.721 --> 41:51.362
That's wonderful.

41:52.463 --> 41:59.153
Well, I think we've had a great start, and I will contact.

41:59.173 --> 42:00.535
Pardon me.

42:02.000 --> 42:09.030
Ron Bailey is the Director of National Programs for Reach Out and Read.

42:09.410 --> 42:29.779
Well, I was just saying that one of the interesting things about interviewing staff here is that all the people who send their resumes, even for the most technical of jobs, and we have quite a few of those now, really are interested in books and they're interested in reading and have a strong belief that reading was

42:30.839 --> 42:32.501
a really important part of their lives.

42:33.301 --> 42:42.771
So it's wonderful in the interviews because you can always start the conversation that way about the love of reading and your shared love of reading.

42:42.791 --> 42:50.359
If you start talking with them about SQL databases, which is really what they're going to be doing later, it's a shift.

42:50.479 --> 42:54.423
But you always have that base in talking to people who want to work here.

42:55.664 --> 42:56.485
It's wonderful.

42:56.525 --> 42:58.246
And they end up here, which is good.

42:58.266 --> 43:00.829
So what's your background or how do you come as a

43:01.383 --> 43:07.513
First of all, I was a kindergarten teacher for many, many years and ran a private kindergarten in D.C.

43:07.894 --> 43:21.335
And then went back to graduate school and actually studied instructional design, focusing on how you train adults in the workplace, how you actually retrain people while they're working.

43:21.436 --> 43:27.205
And this was a really interesting project for me because we were trying to

43:27.370 --> 43:37.419
to retrain doctors in their workplace, and it's challenging because they have no time for one thing, and the other thing is that they believe they don't have anything else to learn.

43:39.081 --> 43:50.852
So how we teach doctors some of the stuff that every good kindergarten or preschool teacher knows is what I'm about.

43:51.152 --> 43:54.255
And give me a couple of examples of what you mean, what kinds of things you have to treat.

43:54.455 --> 44:00.281
Well, you know, things like book language.

44:00.301 --> 44:01.823
You used this word, book language.

44:02.083 --> 44:10.172
Every teacher knows that book language is different from conversational language, and doctors have never stopped to think about that.

44:10.792 --> 44:19.922
When you read aloud to children, there's a cadence to book language that is different.

44:20.594 --> 44:34.688
Or the fact that when you're reading to children, if you, you know, your eyes or your finger sort of lead you to this left-right sequence, every teacher knows that.

44:35.209 --> 44:40.074
And doctors don't, you know, there was no place in their education to learn that.

44:40.334 --> 44:43.097
And so this ended the equation because?

44:43.778 --> 44:48.222
Because you want them to understand why they're doing this, that kids

44:48.505 --> 45:00.661
Kids who are in preschool or kids who are affluent and are read to a lot have the advantage of this book language before they get to kindergarten, even before they get to preschool.

45:00.681 --> 45:07.410
And kids from families that don't read to their kids don't have that experience.

45:07.430 --> 45:17.584
So if the doctor can pass on even the tiniest amount of this information to parents about what reading aloud gets for the kids,

45:17.885 --> 45:20.228
it's really important.

45:20.248 --> 45:27.316
And also if you can grab them with those ideas of, well, they just haven't thought much about it, really.

45:29.178 --> 45:33.203
So, tell me a little bit about the programs that you used to do.

45:33.223 --> 45:33.504
Yeah.

45:34.485 --> 45:43.576
Well, my job is really to keep us going in now 2075 clinics and hospitals across the country.

45:44.296 --> 45:44.837
And we're

45:45.914 --> 45:50.959
The interesting part, I think, is that we're a tiny part of any one of those clinics.

45:50.979 --> 46:01.150
I mean, we're probably 150th of what they do, and we have to insinuate ourselves in there in some way.

46:01.190 --> 46:15.465
First for the training piece, first for getting even an hour with a group of pediatricians and nurses to train them in some of these basics, and then to teach them a little bit about

46:15.952 --> 46:22.359
how to use our grant, which we give to them, and how to raise some money on their own for books to sustain their program.

46:22.419 --> 46:39.879
So I have a staff of six, and that's, you've got Jackie, who's in charge of organizing that training effort, and she deploys about 100 regional trainers who are all physicians who go out and do training for us.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.702
And then we have a

46:43.205 --> 46:50.372
a very sophisticated database which sort of keeps track of the sites and our grants to them.

46:52.254 --> 46:58.560
We are an interesting organization in that we're always raising money for ourselves.

46:58.861 --> 47:05.567
We have to raise several million dollars every year, but almost all that money is granted out to these programs.

47:06.028 --> 47:13.195
So we pay for half of whatever their books cost in the first year and a quarter,

47:13.478 --> 47:15.220
of the cost in subsequent years.

47:16.362 --> 47:23.771
So because that's federal money, I end up with auditors and all the people who want to know how their money was spent.

47:23.791 --> 47:36.887
So a lot of our work has to do with keeping track of sub-granting money and making sure that people are in compliance with the model to some degree or the other.

47:38.993 --> 47:47.746
take some pieces and leave some pieces, but making sure that everybody who gets some of that, federal money especially, is sort of doing the core of the program.

47:47.926 --> 48:08.376
And for us, the core is really this moment, this moment in the exam room when the doctor and the parent and the child are in there together and the doctor says to a parent, you know, do you read with your child, you know?

48:08.643 --> 48:13.368
reading aloud is probably the most important thing you can do to help them do well in school later.

48:14.669 --> 48:20.095
That moment is the core.

48:20.916 --> 48:33.790
So there are other pieces of the model, buying the books and keeping the books and giving the books at the right time and using the books as diagnostic tools and volunteers in the lobby if they can do that.

48:34.010 --> 48:36.152
But it's really that core of

48:37.212 --> 49:07.185
of a nurse or a doctor who are with a parent in the years before they have, they don't have any other authority figure, any other, often any other regular contact with anybody who's in a, I hate to use the word authority, but anyone who's important to them in a professional way and leveraging that moment to talk about reading is what Reach Out and Read does.

49:09.781 --> 49:36.510
It's a very big ask, you know, if you think that a pediatrician or a nurse practitioner has 11 minutes, 12 minutes to do an exam, to give the shots, to ask if there's any other problems, you know, to talk about seat belts and bike helmets, and we're asking them for a minute.

49:37.371 --> 49:38.011
They want one minute.

49:38.492 --> 49:38.792
Yeah.

49:39.802 --> 49:49.393
And it's a, you know, in every one of those 200, 2075 sites, it's a significant ask.

49:49.413 --> 49:50.635
We're looking for two things.

49:50.675 --> 50:00.967
You need that one minute, and for the life of the program for each individual, which is for a kid, it's from six months to five years.

50:00.987 --> 50:01.127
Uh-huh.

50:01.147 --> 50:02.348
You're looking for 25 bucks.

50:02.368 --> 50:02.569
Ten bucks.

50:02.589 --> 50:02.869
Ten bucks.

50:02.889 --> 50:03.830
Twenty-five dollars to buy.

50:03.870 --> 50:04.951
Twenty-five bucks, I guess.

50:04.971 --> 50:05.372
Twenty-five dollars.

50:05.452 --> 50:05.993
Ten bucks.

50:06.033 --> 50:06.813
Twenty-five dollars.

50:06.914 --> 50:07.294
Yeah.

50:07.730 --> 50:11.674
So really, you're not asking for a whole heck of a lot here, are you, in terms of?

50:12.976 --> 50:14.818
Not for any individual clinic.

50:14.858 --> 50:21.625
When I see it globally, where it adds into, you know, huge numbers.

50:21.705 --> 50:29.493
But it's a small, it's a small, it's a, I think we get a lot of bang for the buck.

50:29.513 --> 50:30.474
You know, the time.

50:30.494 --> 50:31.295
You're looking for the one minute.

50:31.495 --> 50:31.776
Right.

50:32.416 --> 50:36.741
But if you go to some, some HMO, like Kaiser,

50:37.531 --> 50:47.303
who measures every second of a well-child visit, and you ask them for a minute of their well-child visit, it's a huge ask.

50:49.045 --> 51:04.263
So Kaiser sees, you know, Kaiser has, we're doing business with Southern California Kaiser, which has 89 clinics and hospitals, and so you add up all the minutes we're asking for, we're asking for a lot.

51:04.283 --> 51:05.905
And every minute to them is money.

51:05.925 --> 51:06.846
Oh, yeah.

51:07.906 --> 51:26.907
and they really have to be persuaded that... As Barry says, they have to be persuaded that it's part of medicine, that literacy is part of pediatrics.

51:28.189 --> 51:32.594
Oh, he loves to talk.

51:32.614 --> 51:33.555
He's the idea man.

51:35.917 --> 51:36.478
But he...

51:36.880 --> 51:46.053
He's done very well by, first with Kaiser in Southern California and now starting a major initiative in all of Los Angeles.

51:46.073 --> 51:48.316
He's ramrodded that through, which is pretty impressive.

51:49.738 --> 51:51.740
Well, I think we've got some good stuff here.

51:51.760 --> 51:54.845
What I'm going to have to do, I want to have, this is like three hours of tape.

51:55.245 --> 52:02.836
I'm going to go back and transcribe it and then assess it and start writing this and then come back with it.

52:02.896 --> 52:03.156
Sure.

52:03.817 --> 52:05.319
Sure.

52:05.339 --> 52:06.060
And then I want to, I mean,

52:06.462 --> 52:10.409
I'm really planning to give this a nice, good run.

52:10.689 --> 52:13.695
Something like 5,000 words is a good run.

52:13.715 --> 52:14.857
Uh-huh.

52:15.879 --> 52:18.323
And a book that will be about 80,000 or 90,000 words.

52:18.343 --> 52:18.483
Uh-huh.

52:18.944 --> 52:19.906
You never have a man.

52:19.926 --> 52:20.166
Right.

52:21.148 --> 52:26.077
Well, I feel like we have... Anyway, we can get people to talk about it.

52:26.778 --> 52:28.521
Well, my books do...

52:29.615 --> 52:30.396
Right.

52:30.416 --> 52:36.882
I mean, we need help on several fronts, you know, and name recognition is great for us.

52:37.482 --> 52:46.711
Well, I know you've been written about everywhere, but I really haven't seen any of a book, a general type thing, so it's a great opportunity for me.

52:46.771 --> 52:54.678
I am bringing in a few other aspects of physicians who are being taught, medical students, the power of narrative and teaching.

52:55.299 --> 52:59.082
Yeah, that's a... How reading the classics makes them better

52:59.888 --> 53:03.092
better doctors and diagnosticians and listeners.

53:03.853 --> 53:12.342
So it's part of the whole... I'm talking to Helen Vendler at Harvard, and she's the top poetry critic in the world.

53:12.382 --> 53:14.445
Is poetry still relevant in our lives?

53:16.047 --> 53:21.873
She's a great mentor to us because she keeps us tied to the importance of reading.

53:21.893 --> 53:26.098
She always, always speaks about the love of reading.

53:26.888 --> 53:29.190
when she talks about reach out and reading.

53:29.671 --> 53:35.817
Many of us get mired in the technical details, and she comes back every time to the love of reading.

53:42.764 --> 53:42.984
Good.

53:44.225 --> 53:49.130
I don't know if you've ever seen her do a training, but... I just met her today for the first time.

53:49.150 --> 53:49.350
Yeah.

53:50.051 --> 53:52.894
She goes... Can I keep you for one more second?

53:52.974 --> 53:53.574
Yeah.

53:53.634 --> 53:56.457
So she goes into a room of...

53:56.875 --> 54:00.118
a hundred, this is a Grand Rounds opportunity.

54:00.198 --> 54:03.080
We've kind of insinuated ourselves into this Grand Rounds.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.782
You don't mind if I shoot a picture, do you?

54:04.982 --> 54:05.423
Go ahead.

54:06.223 --> 54:12.649
Into this Grand Rounds opportunity, which is, you know, in medicine, that's where they teach you how to take out the appendix.

54:12.669 --> 54:14.350
Put your wallet away.

54:19.895 --> 54:25.380
So she goes in, so there's like a hundred sleepy,

54:26.221 --> 54:27.823
Yeah, fine.

54:27.843 --> 54:40.863
Residents, and there's like, you know, 20 grumpy attendings who are supposed to be supervising, and they're required to come to this Grand Rounds every week and learn something new.

54:40.944 --> 54:48.856
And so we've insinuated ourselves into this, you know, and so Perry is our main sort of Grand Rounds speaker.

54:49.376 --> 54:54.304
So she goes in, and you just see this room full of sleepy, tired residents.

54:55.195 --> 55:05.865
And she turns out the lights and she puts up her first slide, her first PowerPoint slide, which is a copy of Goodnight Moon, the cover of the book Goodnight Moon.

55:07.386 --> 55:10.529
And she just starts in a great green room.

55:10.929 --> 55:15.093
And you just hear this collective sigh across the whole auditorium.

55:15.794 --> 55:18.877
And everybody remembers this book from their childhood.

55:19.738 --> 55:23.481
And she's got them for the next hour, you know?

55:23.647 --> 55:24.829
Is she doing that around here?

55:25.670 --> 55:29.215
Those opportunities only come like 15 times a year.

55:29.275 --> 55:32.860
She probably has one on her schedule somewhere in the future.

55:32.880 --> 55:34.903
I wouldn't mind coming to one in Alaska.

55:35.244 --> 55:38.829
Yeah, but she's magical in that way.

55:39.009 --> 55:47.241
I think it's better for me to see it than to... It would be a perfect way, actually, to enter into this.

55:47.288 --> 55:49.750
I'm always thinking, how am I getting into the chapter?

55:49.950 --> 55:52.433
Well, if you could see her do a training.

55:52.553 --> 55:54.675
So it's a training thing I'm looking for?

55:54.695 --> 56:01.121
Well, that's called the Grand Rounds, which is the most formal of the training opportunities that we have.

56:02.002 --> 56:05.024
We do other trainings where you just go and sit around a table like this.

56:05.044 --> 56:07.046
So you think you'll have one scheduled over the next couple of months?

56:07.226 --> 56:08.107
You'll have to ask her.

56:08.147 --> 56:09.348
She does her own schedule.

56:09.388 --> 56:12.031
So it's called the Grand Rounds of Training Opportunities.

56:12.051 --> 56:13.132
And how long does it normally run?

56:13.152 --> 56:14.133
A couple of hours?

56:14.153 --> 56:15.174
An hour.

56:15.194 --> 56:15.574
An hour.

56:15.976 --> 56:17.170
You're pretty structured.

56:17.574 --> 56:19.051
Good.

56:19.071 --> 56:19.759
All right, sir.
