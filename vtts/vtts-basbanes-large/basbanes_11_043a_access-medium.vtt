WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:03.595
Don't mind, I'll go on.

00:03.655 --> 00:04.576
We're talking to Charles.

00:04.596 --> 00:06.077
It promotes your name for me, sir.

00:06.097 --> 00:08.039
Yes, I'm Charles Paul Haber.

00:08.059 --> 00:13.324
I'm the director of the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

00:14.565 --> 00:23.694
Before we start, are you familiar with the new video that the Commission of Reservation and Access has just released?

00:24.495 --> 00:24.655
Here?

00:24.675 --> 00:25.336
In Washington.

00:25.376 --> 00:25.436
No.

00:25.576 --> 00:31.742
You know, they did a video about

00:32.600 --> 00:51.527
10 years ago, 15 years ago, on what they called slow fires and the problem of preservation and what was going to happen if we didn't face up to the acidification problem with the crumbling of all of these books printed roughly after 1850.

00:51.608 --> 01:00.160
They've done another similar thing, also directed by the same person, Terry Sanders,

01:00.325 --> 01:04.109
And it is precisely on the digital library, the Library of the Future.

01:04.509 --> 01:04.729
Okay.

01:05.550 --> 01:07.572
And who would they contact to get with?

01:07.592 --> 01:11.536
Well, it's the Commission on Preservation and Access in Washington.

01:11.776 --> 01:13.358
And they work under whose auspices?

01:13.398 --> 01:18.643
They are an independent, they are part of the Council of Library Resources.

01:20.765 --> 01:22.867
Do they have a website?

01:23.267 --> 01:24.849
I'm sure they do.

01:25.009 --> 01:26.350
Okay, I'll find it.

01:26.566 --> 01:27.748
And they did a video.

01:27.768 --> 01:28.428
And they did a video.

01:28.448 --> 01:30.591
I'm trying to remember the name of the video.

01:30.611 --> 01:32.434
I'll go to Washington in two weeks to L.C.

01:32.454 --> 01:35.157
and see Diane Kresch down there at L.C.

01:35.177 --> 01:35.818
Preservation.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.080
Yeah.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.706
But it was one of the problems, and I'll sort of back into what we were talking about.

01:42.307 --> 01:49.776
One of the, you know, everybody is looking on the digital library as the, it's going to solve all of our problems.

01:49.796 --> 01:56.505
It's going to make, give us instant access worldwide over to anything that's available anywhere.

01:58.713 --> 02:12.469
And we are just now beginning to start to grapple with the problem of how do you make these materials available on an ongoing basis for the foreseeable future.

02:13.130 --> 02:21.860
We have books printed in the 15th century that are just as good now as they were 500 years ago.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.483
And you open them up and it looked like they were published yesterday.

02:24.964 --> 02:28.568
And we don't need any computers or machines or anything else

02:28.936 --> 02:29.356
to read them.

02:30.998 --> 02:33.161
They're just there and you open it and you read it.

02:33.181 --> 02:42.432
The ultimate book technology or the ultimate technology doesn't need electricity, doesn't need and so on.

02:45.195 --> 02:51.923
We have no idea whether 500 years from now people are going to be able to read the digital resources that we're creating right now.

02:53.545 --> 02:56.428
We can take it as a given that the technology will change

02:57.218 --> 03:06.467
We're running into the problem that dictaphone belts that were used in the 40s and the 50s, we can't read them anymore.

03:06.527 --> 03:09.029
The media is still good, but we don't have the machines.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.813
You have that with a lot of computer stuff on cards.

03:13.193 --> 03:13.814
That's right.

03:13.914 --> 03:14.615
Punched cards.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.436
We've got punched cards.

03:17.457 --> 03:20.380
We've got stuff that is in WordPerfect 2.1.

03:20.820 --> 03:25.605
The current programs of WordPerfect won't read that material.

03:26.682 --> 03:28.744
And essentially, it's lost.

03:28.884 --> 03:32.627
And you have stuff on big floppy disks, and the computers aren't even made with slides.

03:32.707 --> 03:33.228
That's right.

03:33.248 --> 03:35.110
I mean, just simple little things like that.

03:35.270 --> 03:55.508
And when I started, when I did my catalog of the medieval manuscripts in Hispanic society, I, in fact, used a hard-wired word processor that used 8-inch floppy disks that could hold 64K.

03:56.399 --> 04:00.206
and it had a 16K memory, and I thought it was the greatest thing I ever saw.

04:00.888 --> 04:17.260
You know, as a medievalist, towards the end of this, you have to give me, because I'm really planning, I'm going to Seville, you mentioned, you gave me the names of some people I should see, and I also plan to do the great Renaissance libraries of Italy, and maybe you can give me some ideas of people and places, because I really would love to,

04:17.712 --> 04:21.777
on your expertise in that area, because I also do have libraries through history.

04:21.938 --> 04:22.518
So go ahead.

04:22.538 --> 04:22.779
I'm sorry.

04:23.460 --> 04:39.080
So one of the things that we need to start to deal with is how do we structure our libraries so that, in fact, we can migrate this digital information from one technology to the next.

04:40.102 --> 04:44.968
And everybody seems to be fairly concerned and fairly in agreement

04:45.421 --> 04:47.224
that we're going to have to migrate this stuff.

04:47.244 --> 05:00.102
We cannot keep all of the generations of technology available and working and functioning from now in the foreseeable future.

05:00.763 --> 05:09.235
And that means we have to have repositories that are set up to do that process.

05:09.502 --> 05:10.943
So you're working on that now here?

05:11.003 --> 05:11.404
We're not.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.507
Well, we're worried about it, but we don't have a solution to it.

05:14.827 --> 05:16.949
But we're working on it, I think, is what I said.

05:17.309 --> 05:19.872
No, we're not even really working on it.

05:20.372 --> 05:29.320
Right now, what we're focusing on is how do we get material from paper into digital form.

05:29.340 --> 05:33.024
And right now, we're putting it on servers, and we're making it available over the world like that.

05:36.447 --> 05:38.749
We haven't really... We're not...

05:39.083 --> 05:45.331
that are not organized yet for the next step of this process.

05:45.351 --> 05:59.550
But I do think that we're never going to replace, I don't think, and certainly in my lifetime and yours, we're not going to replace the book as a, you know, sit down.

05:59.570 --> 06:04.236
If I want to read a monograph or a novel, I'm going to read it in the book.

06:04.276 --> 06:07.000
I'm not going to sit down in front of a computer screen and read it in the future.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.061
Okay, but there is a lot of,

06:08.345 --> 06:28.045
I know that in particular here at the University of California, Berkeley, that the university has made a decision to channel resources, money, away from the acquisition of special collections and building on collections, and to maybe kind of those resources, certainly for the next 10 or 20 years.

06:29.306 --> 06:35.753
This is what I've understood, I've heard, you know, from sources, and that there's a lot of concern that the focus

06:35.952 --> 06:40.377
A phrase one person uses is a paradigm shift or something?

06:40.437 --> 06:41.979
There is a paradigm shift going on.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.080
That is absolutely true.

06:43.421 --> 06:48.086
Right now we're spending about 3% of our collections budget on digital resources.

06:48.106 --> 06:48.486
Just 3%?

06:48.587 --> 06:51.370
For the whole university or for...?

06:51.530 --> 06:53.132
For the general library.

06:53.152 --> 06:53.252
Okay.

06:53.873 --> 06:57.577
But the collections budget is about $8 million a year.

06:58.158 --> 06:59.199
That's not for acquisitions.

06:59.379 --> 07:00.360
This is for acquisitions.

07:00.701 --> 07:02.102
You're spending $8 million a year?

07:02.282 --> 07:03.063
Yeah.

07:03.083 --> 07:03.364
Really?

07:03.484 --> 07:03.664
Yeah.

07:04.353 --> 07:11.139
I mean, this is comparable to, it's probably slightly less than, I mean, it's comparable to what the other major research libraries are spending.

07:11.839 --> 07:13.921
Less than Harvard, certainly less than Harvard.

07:14.021 --> 07:14.902
But that's pretty good, though.

07:14.922 --> 07:16.203
Eight million is not bad.

07:16.243 --> 07:19.686
Yeah, but it's not enough.

07:19.706 --> 07:29.334
And the real problem is that the, you should, one of the people you might want to talk to about this is Brian Hawkins at Brown.

07:30.475 --> 07:33.398
Which is close to me, to Brian Hawkins, and where do we see it?

07:33.418 --> 07:33.938
At Brown.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.025
I don't know what his title is these days.

07:38.065 --> 07:38.946
What department, though?

07:39.187 --> 07:40.388
Well, he's in the administration.

07:40.649 --> 07:41.390
Okay.

07:43.232 --> 07:50.902
Because he used to be in charge of academic computing.

07:51.003 --> 08:04.060
But he has written a couple of very, very interesting papers where he's sort of charting the percentage of the world's published information that research libraries in the United States are able to buy.

08:04.478 --> 08:12.707
His figure is that in 1980, we were acquiring collectively some roughly 6% of what's published in the world.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.533
The research libraries, institutional universities.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.715
Right, right.

08:19.775 --> 08:26.423
It was the major players, including places like New York Public and Library of Congress.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.665
So 94% is not being accounted for.

08:28.685 --> 08:29.627
It's not being accounted for.

08:29.887 --> 08:33.591
By the year 2000, he estimates that we will be getting less than 1%.

08:34.162 --> 08:38.167
of what's published, because there's just been this enormous explosion.

08:38.908 --> 08:53.725
As the third world countries bring their medium incomes up and there's more interest in larger educational systems and so on and so forth, there's just more publishing going on.

08:54.306 --> 08:55.968
How would you define a paradigm shift?

08:56.369 --> 09:02.616
I think the paradigm shift that we're looking at is, in fact, from print to digital technology.

09:03.085 --> 09:09.774
And we're going through exactly the same thing that we went through from the manuscript to the printed book.

09:11.116 --> 09:15.302
And it's fascinating to think about the stages that this has gone through.

09:16.524 --> 09:26.939
If you take the 15th century and the 20th century and you look at it decade by decade, printing was invented in the 1440s by Gutenberg.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.262
The computer was invented in the 1940s.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.263
mostly as a result of the Second World War.

09:34.405 --> 09:39.531
It started to become generalized in the 1450s.

09:39.991 --> 09:45.438
In the 1950s, when Thomas Watson Sr.

09:45.558 --> 09:51.325
got IBM in computing, he thought that there might be a market for tin computers in the United States.

09:52.627 --> 09:53.748
This was in the early 50s.

09:55.030 --> 09:59.535
And that's roughly about the same period when the printing press began to

10:00.106 --> 10:03.932
It extended itself from Mainzen to other German cities.

10:04.393 --> 10:06.056
The computer went international.

10:06.376 --> 10:08.780
The printing press went international in the 1460s.

10:09.261 --> 10:11.925
The computer went international in the 1960s.

10:12.066 --> 10:15.031
I mean, you can follow through the progression.

10:15.051 --> 10:15.832
It's very neat.

10:15.852 --> 10:16.693
Yeah.

10:16.713 --> 10:24.426
And the first printers did the same thing that the first computer people did.

10:24.963 --> 10:32.130
and to some extent we're still doing it, the first printers thought that they had found a new way to do manuscripts, a better way.

10:33.632 --> 10:42.641
But they didn't really think through the changes, and it took them a while to figure out that some of the things that you did with manuscripts you didn't have to do with a printed book.

10:42.661 --> 10:44.984
Are you talking about technical changes or cultural changes?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.926
No, I'm talking about technical changes.

10:47.646 --> 10:54.193
In other words, by the end of the 15th century, the technology for manuscript production had been highly

10:54.477 --> 10:55.539
No, it was.

10:55.639 --> 10:56.480
It was an industry.

10:56.941 --> 11:01.468
So, you had one guy, you had people who prepared the parchment or paper.

11:01.488 --> 11:02.189
Oh, it was institutionalized.

11:02.249 --> 11:02.990
Yeah.

11:03.010 --> 11:08.658
And you had scribes who did the writing, and then you had illuminators who came in and did the illumination.

11:08.678 --> 11:10.121
Lubricators and all the other stuff.

11:10.501 --> 11:16.350
And so, for example, you had these beautiful illuminated initials at the beginning of each chapter.

11:16.651 --> 11:17.492
On the printed books?

11:17.733 --> 11:19.235
No, on the manuscripts.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.899
But they even did that with some of the very early printed books.

11:21.999 --> 11:26.266
But they would leave these, the scribe would leave a, you know, a square place.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.307
So the other guy could do it.

11:27.327 --> 11:29.511
Yeah, and they would do this with the printed books as well.

11:30.592 --> 11:38.845
They would leave these blanks, and then they would sell it, and then the owner, the new owner, would hire an illuminator to come in and do the

11:39.128 --> 11:44.655
To give it the sense, it's like fake leather, synthetic leather.

11:44.675 --> 11:47.119
No, this is what books ought to look like.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.844
They ought to have illuminations, especially if they're deluxe things.

11:51.504 --> 11:58.253
And it took them a while to figure out, God, you know, we could do woodcuts and we could have the same effect.

11:59.655 --> 12:08.427
And so the whole process of running it through the illuminator defeated one of the purposes of the printed book, which was to...

12:09.014 --> 12:16.445
reduce the cost and also increase the diffusion and dissemination and speed it up.

12:17.126 --> 12:18.808
And we did the same thing with computers.

12:19.549 --> 12:23.615
In other words, we used the computer to produce printed books.

12:23.775 --> 12:28.602
That was the first use of the computer publishing industry, you know, the word processing.

12:28.622 --> 12:33.089
Well, we wouldn't, you know, when you do word processing, you're not really interested in the file.

12:33.129 --> 12:38.076
All you're interested in is that paper printout that you get that you can then

12:38.427 --> 12:46.155
And the publishers, for a long time, were not interested in the tapes that they created that ran the typesetting machinery.

12:46.555 --> 12:48.658
All they were interested was in the printed book.

12:49.178 --> 12:54.824
And now we're realizing that what used to be that means is an end in itself.

12:55.745 --> 13:04.053
That the machine-readable text is, for many purposes, much more useful than the printed book.

13:05.014 --> 13:07.557
And if you look at the diffusion of information

13:09.511 --> 13:27.933
The digital resource, the electronic resource, the electronic encyclopedia, the census materials, or the book of facts, all of this stuff is much more useful on the web and electronic form than it is sitting on a shelf in the library.

13:29.995 --> 13:32.878
So that's the paradigm shift.

13:32.979 --> 13:38.505
The transmittal of information is no longer dependent on print technology.

13:40.477 --> 13:44.380
It's going to be the electronic media.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.305
But we're still, we have a print mentality focus.

13:50.526 --> 13:58.673
It's going to take us a long time to realize that we don't have to do things the way we did with the printed books.

13:58.693 --> 13:59.794
And we're still struggling with this.

14:00.194 --> 14:02.796
Copyright.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.077
The real problems are not technical.

14:04.338 --> 14:05.539
They're legal.

14:06.119 --> 14:08.001
And economic.

14:08.201 --> 14:09.522
How do publishers...

14:09.974 --> 14:12.998
make money from these kinds of information.

14:13.218 --> 14:14.960
Yeah, do I want my book posted on the Internet?

14:14.980 --> 14:16.222
That's right.

14:16.242 --> 14:17.163
No, that's right.

14:17.203 --> 14:17.463
Well?

14:17.884 --> 14:18.625
One word answer.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.409
I want people to buy it.

14:22.830 --> 14:32.421
It took us several hundred years to work out the relationship between authors, printers, publishers, and readers in a printed book.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.285
I hope it doesn't take us that long to figure out.

14:36.987 --> 14:38.749
But this is the paradigm shift.

14:39.944 --> 14:43.008
Because it doesn't affect simply print versus digital.

14:43.069 --> 14:50.680
It is the whole body of people who create information, sell information, use information.

14:52.222 --> 15:05.361
How about, we are sitting in the Bancroft Library, where you have one extraordinary special collections of manuscript material, just print books.

15:05.746 --> 15:08.189
Let's also be clear that you have unique objects here.

15:08.209 --> 15:08.589
That's right.

15:08.669 --> 15:11.692
We've got the archives of the Sierra Club.

15:11.812 --> 15:19.160
And I know what you have, so I don't want to waste... Pat Brown's paper, you know, just all sorts of... But what are you doing?

15:19.360 --> 15:22.804
I mean, you only have so much money coming from the state of California.

15:22.824 --> 15:23.424
Right.

15:24.525 --> 15:25.306
Totally inadequate.

15:25.626 --> 15:26.788
Totally inadequate, I'm sure.

15:26.828 --> 15:32.353
And you mentioned that you have $8 million available, but... This is for the entire library.

15:32.854 --> 15:33.595
I understand.

15:33.735 --> 15:34.015
Okay.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.382
Okay, that's very interesting.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.604
I'm glad you made that point.

15:38.885 --> 15:42.570
How about a philosophy for acquisitions of special collections?

15:42.610 --> 15:44.912
Are you now building on strengths?

15:44.952 --> 16:04.255
Do you have an alert eye for creating collections for scholars who might be interested in a subject, or do you see your role now as more or less providing material for stuff that's requested?

16:05.703 --> 16:12.272
We are a special collection of library, and our focus is on primary sources and unique material.

16:13.153 --> 16:15.556
And so we are going to be continuing to do that.

16:16.137 --> 16:24.027
In fact, we're just in the process of going through a collection policy review to figure out where should we be focusing our energy.

16:24.047 --> 16:25.429
We cannot collect everything.

16:26.150 --> 16:35.001
So in collaboration with the faculty, we're sitting down and saying, all right, our Bancroft's focus is the history of California and the American West.

16:35.504 --> 16:40.772
what are the major issues that we should be collecting material in?

16:40.912 --> 16:43.657
And one of these subject areas is the environment.

16:45.480 --> 16:53.392
You know, the water wars in California have been, it's a major theme starting in the 19th century and going on.

16:53.793 --> 17:03.688
And so we are going to continue to look at water, land use, the environment, the struggle between the public good and private enterprise developers,

17:04.259 --> 17:06.141
All of these kinds of things.

17:06.161 --> 17:09.224
Are you talking specifically about primary materials?

17:09.264 --> 17:10.685
We're talking about primary source materials.

17:10.705 --> 17:17.111
We're talking about the papers of people like David Brower, who's the former president of the Sierra Club.

17:17.131 --> 17:24.098
We're talking about company records to the extent that we can get access to them.

17:25.179 --> 17:31.465
Another major area that we're looking at is biotechnology, which was basically invented in the Bay Area.

17:32.238 --> 17:36.823
The people who created that industry are still around, still active.

17:36.843 --> 17:38.485
So you're actually working?

17:38.805 --> 17:39.987
We're working with them.

17:40.007 --> 17:42.089
Can you name any specifics?

17:42.109 --> 17:49.177
Well, the... William Rudder and Stanley Cohen.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.100
Stanley Cohen is a professor at Stanford.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.902
William Rudder is a... R-U-T-T.

17:54.122 --> 17:55.163
R-U-T-T-E-R.

17:56.725 --> 17:58.427
He's a professor at UC San Francisco.

17:58.547 --> 18:01.030
They created...

18:01.263 --> 18:07.849
They invented recombinant DNA technology, which is the basis for the biotechnology industry.

18:08.690 --> 18:14.255
And Rudder was the founder, one of the founders of Chiron.

18:14.275 --> 18:14.595
Of which?

18:14.736 --> 18:14.996
Of what?

18:15.056 --> 18:15.456
Chiron.

18:15.596 --> 18:22.323
I don't... Chiron and Ginentech were the two original biotech firms.

18:23.344 --> 18:27.227
And I get them both confused about who was in charge of this one.

18:27.247 --> 18:28.148
Well, I'll do a search.

18:28.955 --> 18:44.516
But, and these companies are now about 20 years old, so we are going to be working with them to set up records management programs to make sure that their company archives remain in existence.

18:45.398 --> 18:50.084
And hopefully they'll come to the Bancroft Library at some point when they are no longer... Okay.

18:50.164 --> 18:53.008
And you said this is a review of, what did you call that review?

18:53.629 --> 18:54.470
Collection policy.

18:54.871 --> 18:56.633
Is this something that's being...

18:56.950 --> 18:59.272
formulated now, or do you have it?

18:59.852 --> 19:00.953
It's being formulated right now.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.094
We're going through the process.

19:02.134 --> 19:08.039
We had a series of meetings with faculty, mostly with faculty members, both here and in other UC campuses.

19:08.900 --> 19:09.921
Go ahead.

19:09.941 --> 19:10.261
I'm sorry.

19:11.562 --> 19:19.069
And now we're taking the results of those interviews and putting them into a formal statement of, this is where we're going to be putting our efforts.

19:19.089 --> 19:21.431
Is this something I can get when it's... Sure.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.852
When do you think that'll be?

19:22.952 --> 19:24.514
It's sometime this semester.

19:24.534 --> 19:25.034
Yeah.

19:25.054 --> 19:26.075
So I'll plug it.

19:26.095 --> 19:26.215
Sure.

19:27.106 --> 19:54.030
You know, I'd be curious, you know, there is, people have expressed anxiety out there, and, you know, we'll hear from people here that there is some concern among some faculty, not specific, but certainly, I don't have any names, but, you know, that maybe the focus of the library, not just the background, but the university policy is shifting away from that.

19:54.191 --> 19:55.712
It's, the question is that

19:56.047 --> 19:59.591
I'm not going to be naive about this.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.254
Clearly, you know that people are concerned.

20:01.274 --> 20:01.994
Sure.

20:02.095 --> 20:04.878
But there is a finite amount of money available.

20:05.319 --> 20:11.026
Increasingly, information resources are going to be available only in digital format.

20:14.210 --> 20:25.564
The inflation factor in the cost of printed materials is going up between 12% and 15% a year.

20:26.320 --> 20:31.546
You know, you sort of look at these scenarios and you try and play them out.

20:33.468 --> 20:54.032
If we continued to buy every cereal in the area of science technology that we currently buy, and simply cut everything else so that we could protect that collection, within five years, we would not be buying any journals in the humanities or social sciences.

20:56.594 --> 20:59.337
just tough decisions after you make or something.

20:59.597 --> 21:10.970
And so we have been going through, and most major libraries, with the possible exception of Harvard, go through every year or every other year a serials cutting program.

21:11.470 --> 21:22.262
You divide up the serials by subject area, and you talk to the faculty and say, look, we have to cut 5% of the cost in this particular area.

21:22.943 --> 21:24.765
Which are the least important serials?

21:24.805 --> 21:25.926
And of course the faculty says,

21:26.108 --> 21:27.149
They're all important.

21:27.990 --> 21:28.991
You can't cut any of them.

21:30.332 --> 21:33.455
And that just simply throws the burden back on the library.

21:33.475 --> 21:38.759
You say, we're going to do it, and if you don't help us, then you're just going to have to live with the consequences.

21:39.560 --> 21:43.123
So you've got the cost for print publication is increasing.

21:43.143 --> 21:44.865
We can't afford to buy everything we have.

21:45.405 --> 21:50.790
And at the same time, an increasing amount of material is coming in digital format.

21:51.010 --> 21:55.474
Sometimes you've got both, and the publishers are saying, well,

21:56.180 --> 22:04.071
we'll provide the electronic version of this journal if you continue to buy the print journal.

22:05.473 --> 22:09.939
And we'll only charge you 120% of the print publication price.

22:09.979 --> 22:12.062
What percent?

22:12.082 --> 22:12.242
120%.

22:12.262 --> 22:13.444
In other words, 20% more.

22:13.464 --> 22:16.148
And most libraries are saying no.

22:16.168 --> 22:24.499
We'll either buy one or the other, and we prefer to have the electronic journal, and we'll cancel the print journal.

22:25.508 --> 22:26.650
And we'll pay for the electronics.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.393
And we'll pay for the electronics.

22:28.673 --> 22:33.301
With the hope that it will be cheaper because you don't have the distribution prices.

22:33.922 --> 22:39.471
And what this means is basically you buy a subscription and you buy access, a site license, to their website.

22:40.974 --> 22:41.775
What does this mean?

22:41.835 --> 22:47.044
What if we cancel the subscription after two years or three years?

22:47.705 --> 22:50.149
Do we still have access to that same...

22:51.108 --> 22:51.969
As you had before.

22:51.989 --> 22:55.913
As we had before, because before we bought the print publication, we had it.

22:56.033 --> 22:57.154
It was a physical copy.

22:57.174 --> 22:57.395
Yeah.

22:58.095 --> 23:02.320
Well, it might behoove you to do a printout as it comes out.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.561
Oh, the stuff as it comes out.

23:03.581 --> 23:05.443
Which would be kind of funny, wouldn't it?

23:05.463 --> 23:05.563
Yeah.

23:06.003 --> 23:13.031
But this is, I mean, you know, people are worried, okay, what's, how, and it varies by discipline.

23:13.051 --> 23:17.255
This is changing much more rapidly in the sciences than it is in the humanities.

23:17.275 --> 23:20.018
And it's much more rapidly in this country than abroad.

23:20.453 --> 23:39.101
So the people in the foreign languages, like me, are really terrified that as we put more and more of our resources into digital stuff, that we're going to give short shrift to the stuff that's published in Latin America, or in Spain, or in Southeast Asia.

23:40.342 --> 23:46.832
And it's going to take a longer time for those publications to come into digital form.

23:47.099 --> 23:48.842
It is exceedingly important.

23:48.882 --> 24:03.630
I guess what we're seeing then is that all research libraries are really having to determine precisely in a very fine way what they're doing, what they're actually going to specialize in.

24:03.791 --> 24:05.714
I guess the days of covering the world are over.

24:06.135 --> 24:07.217
They never existed.

24:08.362 --> 24:12.045
You know, the Farmington Plan, does that bring me to go?

24:12.105 --> 24:16.109
No, but it sounds like something I love right off the bat.

24:16.169 --> 24:19.832
This was an attempt in 1948.

24:19.912 --> 24:23.936
The heads of the major research libraries got together in Farmington, Connecticut.

24:25.857 --> 24:26.758
What's the school there?

24:26.838 --> 24:28.260
Miss somebody's school.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.341
Farmington, Connecticut?

24:29.841 --> 24:32.083
And basically, they divided up the world among themselves.

24:32.503 --> 24:33.124
Come on.

24:33.144 --> 24:36.647
I think they're going to find this.

24:37.437 --> 24:38.578
What's in Farmington?

24:38.598 --> 24:41.001
That's not the University of Connecticut.

24:41.201 --> 24:42.243
It's not Trinity.

24:42.263 --> 24:46.407
It's not, well, there's so many schools in Connecticut.

24:46.808 --> 24:50.652
You need to talk to somebody who has a better knowledge of, you know, the organization.

24:50.672 --> 24:51.733
They've divided up the world?

24:51.974 --> 24:54.597
Yeah, and the idea was... Under the auspices of whom?

24:55.277 --> 25:03.647
It was the, I assume it was the research, not that it wouldn't have been a research library if it didn't exist, but the Association of

25:04.471 --> 25:04.912
What is it?

25:05.172 --> 25:05.773
Research Libraries.

25:05.853 --> 25:07.535
A.R.L., Association of Research Libraries.

25:07.555 --> 25:08.036
I'll find it.

25:09.177 --> 25:18.449
But it was the idea that each library would take responsibility for a particular country.

25:19.391 --> 25:26.099
And so the assurance was that at least one copy of everything published in the world would be somewhere in the United States.

25:27.561 --> 25:32.408
And I can't remember which countries, which libraries did which country.

25:32.428 --> 25:33.169
I've never heard of it.

25:33.810 --> 25:34.090
I love it.

25:34.981 --> 25:41.390
And it wasn't that, you know, you couldn't buy, you know, if Harvard decided they wanted to buy everything, well, that's wonderful.

25:41.931 --> 25:48.620
But if they decided they were going to drop Costa Rica, there would be some place in the country that would buy everything published in Costa Rica.

25:51.163 --> 25:53.567
It was sort of a, it was one of the first attempts at that.

25:53.587 --> 25:54.047
1948?

25:54.368 --> 25:54.988
Yeah.

25:55.449 --> 25:56.130
Wow.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.632
And again, isn't this perfect?

25:57.672 --> 25:59.014
It was almost 50 years ago.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.286
How has the world changed?

26:01.547 --> 26:03.129
No, it collapsed fairly quickly.

26:04.150 --> 26:06.733
Sounds like a league of patients.

26:06.893 --> 26:11.899
Well, I mean, it turned out that it would be a much larger scale problem than people thought.

26:12.921 --> 26:17.046
How did you find out about this one?

26:17.066 --> 26:19.248
Oh, I took a bibliography class when I was in college.

26:19.288 --> 26:20.350
This was 30 years ago.

26:20.410 --> 26:24.415
Now, as your background, you're a medievalist, I know.

26:24.455 --> 26:28.039
It is interesting that so many...

26:28.930 --> 26:38.023
people who direct libraries, like Paul Leclerc or Martin Gregorian or James Billington, come from other disciplines, history or whatever.

26:38.083 --> 26:38.504
Yeah.

26:38.884 --> 26:41.268
Libraries are too important to leave to librarians.

26:41.288 --> 26:42.609
Is that a statement you want to make?

26:42.649 --> 26:44.312
No, that's not a statement I want to be quoted on.

26:44.632 --> 26:47.857
But there is a perspective that comes in.

26:48.137 --> 26:49.840
Yeah.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.823
And do you have a comment on that at all?

26:52.163 --> 26:54.827
Well, I think that it's the perspective of the user.

26:55.107 --> 26:58.532
I mean, librarians do tend to focus on

26:59.761 --> 27:04.107
inside, organizing the materials and the processes and things like this.

27:04.187 --> 27:11.797
And the user looks at it from how well are you serving your constituencies.

27:13.118 --> 27:28.418
Ideally, the librarian should be concerned about that too, but just simply it's in the nature of things, in the ordinary routine, you know, trying to figure out what vendors to buy books from and how to get them cataloged and so on and so forth.

27:28.938 --> 27:35.405
that there's sometimes a tendency to overlook the end user.

27:36.426 --> 27:38.088
Do you have a sense of your constituency?

27:38.909 --> 27:45.437
I think, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, my constituency is the faculty and students on the Berkeley campus.

27:46.077 --> 27:49.481
And this is, there's a tension here because... Attention?

27:49.762 --> 27:53.646
Attention, because Bancroft serves an external

27:54.149 --> 27:55.911
off-campus constituency as well.

27:55.931 --> 28:08.203
It's the major center for the history of California and the American West in the United States, although people of the Beinecke might dispute that, or the Huntington.

28:09.244 --> 28:13.108
And so we have people coming from all over the country.

28:13.388 --> 28:16.171
Half of our users actually come from off-campus.

28:18.313 --> 28:21.416
But we are not a private library.

28:21.476 --> 28:23.818
We are part of the University of California.

28:24.676 --> 28:29.781
which in turn is part of the state of California, and we serve the citizens of the state of California.

28:32.904 --> 28:35.447
And also, but you also certainly welcome scholars.

28:35.607 --> 28:36.107
Absolutely.

28:36.268 --> 28:37.108
Outside scholars.

28:38.129 --> 28:43.495
And I think probably deep down you want to attract the outside scholar.

28:43.515 --> 28:43.935
Sure.

28:45.116 --> 28:51.763
But if it comes to a conflict between do I serve the external scholar or do I serve the faculty and students of the Berkeley campus,

28:52.334 --> 28:54.937
I serve the faculty and students in the Berkeley campus.

28:56.139 --> 29:03.227
Now, this is not a popular position with some of the curators who have been around here for 20 and 25 years.

29:04.709 --> 29:09.755
In point of fact, it very rarely comes down to an either-or choice.

29:13.139 --> 29:20.248
Well, in getting any acquired material, though, if you had a chance to get a really great collection, but if it doesn't really fit into the

29:20.853 --> 29:24.056
you probably got a pass on it, right?

29:24.076 --> 29:24.297
Yes.

29:24.697 --> 29:49.763
I mean, for example, if someone offered us—and this happens quite frequently—a major collection of African materials, we would probably—well, we have a number of Africanist faculty, and they have come up with a proposal that we should collect materials having to do with the transition from apartheid in South Africa.

29:50.688 --> 29:54.032
It's just totally out of, what we call, out of field for Macron.

29:55.895 --> 30:05.026
But it is, in fact, a serious scholarly interest, and so we've come up with a Solomonic proposal.

30:05.066 --> 30:07.750
We will serve as custodians for this collection.

30:07.810 --> 30:09.292
Solomonic proposal.

30:09.312 --> 30:11.595
Solomonic proposal.

30:11.615 --> 30:13.457
Solomonic... Okay, I gotcha.

30:13.497 --> 30:14.819
Well, that can be transcribed.

30:14.839 --> 30:16.341
I've got to know what you're saying.

30:16.361 --> 30:19.665
Solomonic decision, whatever it is.

30:19.966 --> 30:27.115
We will serve as custodians, and we'll process it and make it available, but we're not going to actively collect it.

30:28.116 --> 30:33.222
In other words, we're not going to be writing to people in South Africa and saying, give us this stuff.

30:33.242 --> 30:33.823
Pursuing it.

30:33.843 --> 30:35.845
Pursuing it, yeah.

30:35.865 --> 30:36.746
We will accept it.

30:38.188 --> 30:39.590
It's passive, not active.

30:40.291 --> 30:41.132
Yeah.

30:41.152 --> 30:43.334
Whereas in some areas like California.

30:43.354 --> 30:43.675
It's benevolent.

30:44.155 --> 30:44.496
Right.

30:44.516 --> 30:47.239
But in California, we actively pursue it.

30:47.523 --> 30:52.089
But if you had an African American community in San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:52.109 --> 30:52.330
Absolutely.

30:52.370 --> 30:54.753
And there are kinds of the Black Panther Party.

30:54.813 --> 30:55.354
That's right.

30:55.434 --> 30:57.377
Well, Sanford got the Black Panther Party.

30:57.437 --> 31:01.182
We have Aldous Cleaver's papers, for example.

31:01.383 --> 31:02.564
And that you really want.

31:02.704 --> 31:02.945
Yeah.

31:03.365 --> 31:04.026
That's important.

31:04.146 --> 31:06.169
Yes.

31:06.189 --> 31:06.309
Yeah.

31:07.231 --> 31:11.657
So, African Americans in California, and especially in the Bay Area, absolutely.

31:12.413 --> 31:17.299
We very aggressively try to go out for those sorts of resources.

31:17.379 --> 31:28.793
Once upon a time, and maybe even still upon a time, you would judge a university's reputation by the number of books it had.

31:29.954 --> 31:32.097
And Harvard, I think... And we still do.

31:32.137 --> 31:36.582
The Association of Research Library publishes statistics every year.

31:36.713 --> 31:40.837
on how many volumes were acquired, how many serials... And you're cognizant of these.

31:40.857 --> 31:41.778
Oh, absolutely.

31:41.798 --> 31:43.219
And you'd like to know where you stand.

31:43.239 --> 31:44.160
Yeah.

31:44.180 --> 31:55.712
And we have, up until the budget crisis hit in California, we were, by common consent, the number two university library in the country after Harvard.

31:55.892 --> 31:57.273
You mean combined with UCLA?

31:57.493 --> 31:57.674
No.

31:58.054 --> 31:58.394
Berkeley.

31:58.655 --> 31:59.135
That's Berkeley.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.417
Berkeley alone is number two?

32:01.978 --> 32:02.118
Yeah.

32:02.138 --> 32:02.879
Up until 1990.

32:03.219 --> 32:06.282
We have been slipping down the scales because we have

32:06.633 --> 32:08.555
because of the budget cuts.

32:09.597 --> 32:12.941
You would need to look at the ARL statistics for this year.

32:12.981 --> 32:16.666
I think the last I heard is that we're number four.

32:16.986 --> 32:17.607
You're dropping?

32:17.867 --> 32:18.448
We're dropping.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.411
Who's ahead of you?

32:20.431 --> 32:20.671
UCLA.

32:21.592 --> 32:23.595
And I don't know who number two is right out of hand.

32:26.959 --> 32:28.641
That would be interesting to find out.

32:28.975 --> 32:31.439
You've got to run in a few minutes, and I want you to be there for your meeting.

32:31.659 --> 32:36.766
Well, the meeting will come to me, so we'll just continue until they show up.

32:36.786 --> 32:37.888
One of the prerogatives.

32:38.369 --> 32:38.709
Yeah.

32:39.590 --> 32:46.240
But there are two things that I'd like to follow up on.

32:46.320 --> 32:46.961
Okay.

32:46.981 --> 32:56.555
One is that because of this crisis in costs of publication material, all libraries are cutting, and they're cutting from the edges.

32:57.135 --> 32:58.898
In other words, they're cutting the rare

32:59.317 --> 33:00.839
and less used materials.

33:02.762 --> 33:06.067
And so collections across the country are becoming more homogenized.

33:07.429 --> 33:07.969
That's bad.

33:08.190 --> 33:08.650
That's bad.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.115
You know, we're all collecting the same kinds of stuff.

33:14.198 --> 33:25.695
And we need, we have been in discussions, for example, on how can we do some variant of the Farmington Planet, at least on

33:26.198 --> 33:29.562
regional levels so that, and we do this with Stanford.

33:29.823 --> 33:31.485
We could do more of it, and we should do more of it.

33:32.466 --> 33:39.856
But we'll decide, for example, well, we won't collect Uruguay, and you'll do Uruguay, and you won't collect... Yeah.

33:39.876 --> 33:51.771
And in fact, right now, we're working on a proposal focused on Mexico with Stanford, Berkeley, and the University of Texas at Austin to split up Mexico this way.

33:52.291 --> 33:55.075
Stanford, HSC,

33:55.544 --> 33:59.369
No, it would be, actually, it's the... Oh, that's right.

33:59.429 --> 34:02.172
No, it would be HSE.

34:02.192 --> 34:05.596
They have, I forgot the name of the Latin American Library at Texas.

34:05.897 --> 34:07.759
Texas, Stanford, and Berkeley.

34:08.820 --> 34:09.701
Gonna split up Mexico.

34:09.721 --> 34:10.262
Yeah.

34:10.282 --> 34:14.307
So we'll focus, for example, on Northwest Mexico, Baja California, and that area.

34:15.588 --> 34:23.458
Texas will do Northeast Mexico, Stanford will do Southern Mexico, and we haven't quite figured out what to do with Mexico City.

34:24.653 --> 34:33.285
And we'll systematically collect papers from non-governmental organizations and so on and so on and so on.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.569
So that between the three of us, we will have a comprehensive coverage.

34:37.711 --> 34:47.263
And thereby giving the faculty in all three places more than if we just tried to, everybody tried to do New Mexico by ourselves.

34:48.986 --> 34:53.732
In terms of a place like Bancroft, where we collect archival materials primarily,

34:56.227 --> 35:00.293
We haven't figured out what do we do with digital archival materials.

35:00.754 --> 35:01.656
What do we do with email?

35:03.138 --> 35:07.825
That's where the business of the university is being conducted these days.

35:09.969 --> 35:14.155
And it's not paper memos, which we, you know, we have university archives here.

35:14.195 --> 35:19.163
And so every year or so we get a, you know,

35:19.750 --> 35:28.102
X number of boxes from the office to the president of background material and memos and letters and correspondence and whatnot.

35:29.224 --> 35:30.065
We're missing the email.

35:32.088 --> 35:46.069
We have to figure out how do we collect the information which is generated in the process of doing business, which are the business records of corporations, institutions, individuals.

35:46.249 --> 35:49.133
So it's going to require everybody who gets an email to make a copy of it.

35:49.585 --> 35:50.927
Well, we do this automatically.

35:53.510 --> 35:54.111
I do.

35:54.131 --> 35:54.832
I say wrong myself.

35:54.872 --> 36:04.064
Well, no, but I mean, as an institution, because it's all on one file server, and so, and typically... Yeah, but I can erase what I get, too.

36:04.084 --> 36:10.272
Yeah, which you think you can, but some, but for example... But you don't necessarily erase what you send.

36:10.312 --> 36:11.233
That's right.

36:11.393 --> 36:12.935
So there is a copy on the other end.

36:13.916 --> 36:14.097
Right.

36:14.157 --> 36:18.242
Or copies that I receive, if it's on a general server...

36:18.509 --> 36:21.332
Even though I might erase it and say, well, I'm... The server keeps it.

36:21.352 --> 36:22.113
The server keeps it.

36:22.433 --> 36:28.719
And that's taped off every day, and we keep those tapes for 30 days, and then we recycle them.

36:29.500 --> 36:35.566
So we can always, you know, if we have a crash, we can always go back to... But then maybe you have to keep it.

36:35.987 --> 36:36.787
Maybe we have to keep it.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.848
What does that imply?

36:39.190 --> 36:47.318
It implies 50 years from now we have to have Eudora, or whatever email...

36:48.192 --> 36:56.524
software program we're using, or we have to figure out some way, some generic way of saving this stuff so that 20 years from now we can go back and look at it.

36:56.544 --> 36:57.926
Do we want everything?

36:57.946 --> 36:58.888
Do we want everything?

36:59.388 --> 37:00.830
That's another question.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.813
Charles, meet me at 1.15 for lunch.

37:02.873 --> 37:04.776
Yeah.

37:05.738 --> 37:06.559
That's going to be in there.

37:06.759 --> 37:06.919
Right.

37:07.400 --> 37:12.307
I mean, there is this problem of sifting out, and that's what the curators do with paper stuff.

37:12.327 --> 37:13.609
I mean, we will get archived

37:14.045 --> 37:16.388
the papers of an individual, for example.

37:16.508 --> 37:19.812
You did say briefly, and I have to go see Mr. Linen, too.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.073
He's right close.

37:21.113 --> 37:21.974
He's right next door.

37:22.675 --> 37:36.931
Maybe this question is better addressed to him, but we, you know, if books aren't read in three or four or five years, do you give him a look and say, maybe it goes to the depository?

37:37.092 --> 37:38.453
It goes to the depository.

37:39.194 --> 37:40.035
We do

37:40.437 --> 37:47.266
You know, we do get rid of stuff, but, you know, we don't really like to because... Take scientific literature.

37:47.306 --> 37:58.101
I mean, it's got a shelf life of about five years, and after that it's just... It's in terms of... Well, in terms of the cutting edge of research, it's just not used very much.

37:58.121 --> 38:00.384
But then it becomes a source for history of science and technology.

38:02.747 --> 38:03.128
Okay.

38:04.390 --> 38:09.837
So... You know, there's a lot of... A lot of these monographs maybe are...

38:10.407 --> 38:18.780
it is argued because they are so perishable, maybe these things are better done online.

38:19.481 --> 38:19.942
Right.

38:19.982 --> 38:20.162
Exactly.

38:20.182 --> 38:22.446
And because they're changing, and they're so expensive to buy.

38:22.506 --> 38:23.447
Yeah.

38:23.708 --> 38:29.397
And the monograph has... It's $140 for one stupid little book.

38:29.417 --> 38:29.957
Well, yeah.

38:30.018 --> 38:34.204
And, you know, the press runs are... One of the reasons is that

38:34.673 --> 38:39.757
As libraries cut back, the press runs get smaller, the average price per volume goes up.

38:39.837 --> 38:48.104
I mean, the average press run for a monograph, like most of the university presses, has gone down from about 500 copies to about 300 copies.

38:49.686 --> 38:56.491
And something like that, it probably makes more sense to put it up on the internet and read it.

38:56.511 --> 38:57.012
I didn't interview you.

38:57.032 --> 38:58.413
Do you know Kenny Carpenter at Harvard?

38:59.154 --> 38:59.774
I know who he is.

39:00.234 --> 39:04.478
He wanted to actually do, it's only this, because Harvard

39:05.656 --> 39:12.225
to do a monograph, to do it online as opposed to publishing.

39:12.726 --> 39:13.908
Well, Stanford's already done this.

39:14.048 --> 39:19.756
They got a grant from Mellon to put 10 of their books on Latin American studies and put them up online, basically as a study.

39:20.377 --> 39:21.559
Have they done it yet?

39:21.579 --> 39:22.641
They're in the process of doing it.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.982
They have some of the material up already.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.565
Have you talked to Mike Keller?

39:25.705 --> 39:26.306
Last year.

39:26.666 --> 39:26.987
Okay.

39:27.387 --> 39:34.077
And I think it's probably time to... Yeah, you might want to revisit and find out how things have changed with the high-wired press and...

39:34.411 --> 39:35.272
But I do have him.

39:35.472 --> 39:38.696
In fact, right after I talked to you, I went on to see him last year.

39:39.697 --> 39:42.700
I thought this would be Stanford, but it's become so big.

39:43.041 --> 39:47.706
I've been to Cornell, and I've been to, quickly, medieval stuff.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.148
Somebody on Seville.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.110
Anybody in Italy want to suggest?

39:51.210 --> 39:58.418
Seville is the Archive of the Indies, and this is all of the documentation of the... There's a brand new book on that, by the way.

39:58.559 --> 39:59.039
Brand new.

39:59.059 --> 39:59.760
It just came in.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.441
I got it.

40:00.461 --> 40:01.302
It's a review copy.

40:01.402 --> 40:03.304
Beautiful book on the Archive of the Indies.

40:03.908 --> 40:04.910
on Dome Press.

40:05.831 --> 40:08.595
I wanted to email you the thing on it when I got there.

40:08.635 --> 40:09.837
I would really appreciate that.

40:09.917 --> 40:10.218
Okay.

40:10.238 --> 40:12.221
You have an email here.

40:12.281 --> 40:17.148
The names I gave you are no longer operative because these people were all fired because the government changed.

40:18.049 --> 40:18.330
Okay.

40:18.370 --> 40:24.079
And the current director is a woman named ... That's fine.

40:24.660 --> 40:31.570
Who would you ... I guess you were telling me somebody who's knowledgeable on the Columbus Library and Seville, too.

40:32.039 --> 40:35.562
This is my colleague, Arthur Askins, who is on the Berkeley campus.

40:36.043 --> 40:36.483
He's here?

40:36.683 --> 40:36.883
Yes.

40:37.364 --> 40:38.445
A-S-K-I-N-S?

40:38.485 --> 40:38.725
Right.

40:39.526 --> 40:40.827
In what department?

40:40.847 --> 40:41.788
The Spanish department.

40:42.168 --> 40:45.852
I probably won't get a chance to see, but I can probably follow him.

40:47.974 --> 40:56.822
And this is regarding the... And this is regarding the Library of Columbus's son, which was the largest private library in Europe in the 16th century.

40:56.842 --> 40:57.963
Yeah, I've got to go there.

40:58.003 --> 41:00.105
His number is 841-

41:01.486 --> 41:01.726
5797.

41:01.847 --> 41:05.131
And he could tell me about it, about its significance.

41:05.151 --> 41:05.912
Yes, absolutely.

41:06.774 --> 41:07.615
It's a very fun book.

41:07.695 --> 41:08.997
Yeah, yeah.

41:09.017 --> 41:09.477
It's 11.

41:09.537 --> 41:11.320
I've got to go see Mr. Lyman.

41:11.660 --> 41:12.081
Yes.

41:12.782 --> 41:22.155
We're doing digital, we're digitizing medieval manuscripts and things like this, too, and so I can give you, yeah, and as a matter of fact, I can give you a URL.

41:22.195 --> 41:23.397
All right.

41:24.719 --> 41:28.164
He says, as Nick gets worried about it, he says, what?

41:28.184 --> 41:28.945
Oh, really?

41:30.224 --> 41:33.147
Well, the British Library has turned the page.

41:33.908 --> 41:39.034
They're putting up the Lydisfar and Gospels and Beowulf.

41:39.535 --> 41:49.786
Well, we're interested in this, but we're also very, very focused on setting standards.

41:49.806 --> 41:55.032
We're trying to create standards for this kind of stuff.

41:55.052 --> 41:57.615
Precisely to make... You said I could grab some of this stuff here, right?

41:58.152 --> 42:23.063
Here's the digital scriptorium.

42:23.937 --> 42:30.683
project that we're working on with.

42:31.724 --> 42:53.944
It's a research project that we're doing with Columbia, and that we hope will be in collaboration with the European libraries eventually, to make this material available over the web for comparative purposes.

42:54.042 --> 42:58.328
It's created a total scholarly environment.

42:58.348 --> 42:59.690
Sunsite.Berkeley.

42:59.931 --> 43:03.095
S-U-N-S-I-T-E.Berkeley.

43:03.476 --> 43:06.060
Capital Berkeley.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.785
Capital Berkeley.

43:10.366 --> 43:14.172
Capital E-E-U-X-R-E.

43:14.192 --> 43:14.392
C-I-H-D-U.

43:15.253 --> 43:16.495
And slash script card.

43:21.002 --> 43:21.102
Okay.

43:21.162 --> 43:21.282
Super.

43:21.700 --> 43:22.444
Can I call you?

43:23.007 --> 43:23.571
Sure.

43:23.631 --> 43:25.401
Absolutely.

43:25.461 --> 43:25.743
Yes.

43:26.085 --> 43:29.263
I mean, we obviously just scratched the surface here.
