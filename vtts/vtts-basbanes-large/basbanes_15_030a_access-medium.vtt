00:02.174 --> 00:03.916
Test, test, test, test, test.

00:04.878 --> 00:06.800
Talking to Dennis McFarlane.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.404
It was a pleasure as soon as you will take.

00:09.464 --> 00:09.864
Thank you.

00:12.528 --> 00:18.095
How should we enter the... You know, I find some... Thank you very much, by the way, for sending me the other books.

00:18.115 --> 00:18.416
You're welcome.

00:18.636 --> 00:21.140
Because there are certain themes and parallels.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.302
We have ghosts that show up.

00:23.343 --> 00:24.764
We have music that shows up.

00:24.784 --> 00:29.591
We have suicides, fallen bodies out of windows.

00:30.833 --> 00:31.894
Can we enter there?

00:32.026 --> 00:33.728
Sure, yeah.

00:33.748 --> 00:35.630
As a matter of fact, I was thinking about that this morning.

00:35.650 --> 00:48.222
I was thinking about... Well, I guess because I was thinking about your coming here and anticipating sort of questions about recurrent themes in the work and stuff.

00:48.682 --> 00:54.888
What I was thinking about it was that how that's something that I learn as I look back on the work.

00:55.349 --> 00:56.070
You know what I mean?

00:56.090 --> 00:59.653
I don't sit down and think... As a matter of fact, every once in a while I think...

01:00.089 --> 01:04.254
I don't know what I'm going to do next, but I'll be damned if I'm going to write about alcoholism.

01:04.434 --> 01:10.501
I'll be damned if there's going to be a suicide, or anybody jumping out of a window, or any prescient dreams.

01:10.561 --> 01:22.034
You know, because I look back and think, yeah, you know, sort of like when John Irving became so famous with Garp, and then you saw these bears everywhere, and everybody's going, what in the world is this guy's thing for bears?

01:22.134 --> 01:25.157
And he came right back again with bears in the Hotel New Hampshire.

01:25.698 --> 01:26.839
Yeah, yeah.

01:26.971 --> 01:32.576
But, you know, I mean, that's because I think so much of it is unconscious, you know?

01:32.656 --> 01:41.724
I mean, as I said, I mean, it's in retrospect that I notice that, oh, yeah, there are these sort of recurring things.

01:41.744 --> 01:42.405
Yeah, it really is.

01:42.425 --> 01:46.989
I mean, even right down to the fall out of the window, though?

01:48.330 --> 01:55.797
I mean, you know, I think with something like falling out of a window, there's a moment when...

01:56.148 --> 02:00.452
I have to make the artistic decision, perhaps.

02:00.792 --> 02:12.743
I mean, I honestly can't tell you, I don't remember whether I thought, oh, I can't have this girl in A Face at the Window fall out of a window because somebody fell out of a window in the music room.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.366
I don't even know if I had a moment like that.

02:15.426 --> 02:19.770
But if I did, I clearly made the decision to go ahead and do it.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.232
I guess you anticipate the question.

02:22.252 --> 02:25.395
Had you had that moment, it wouldn't have stopped you from going...

02:25.544 --> 02:27.046
I don't think so, not in that case.

02:27.066 --> 02:27.886
What is there about that?

02:28.087 --> 02:29.648
I mean, can you try to examine it?

02:30.009 --> 02:31.190
What is there about that image?

02:31.730 --> 02:34.473
I have so many things that seem to need to be examined.

02:35.314 --> 02:37.657
That doesn't seem like one I need to really focus on.

02:37.717 --> 02:38.718
I don't believe I have.

02:38.978 --> 02:43.783
Well, I mean, that's one, but... I don't know.

02:43.803 --> 02:51.751
I think one of the reasons that something like that would be repeatable is because it's not so unusual.

02:51.811 --> 02:55.315
It's not like something completely...

02:55.767 --> 02:56.288
Weird.

02:56.308 --> 02:58.812
I mean, people do fall out of windows, you know.

02:59.974 --> 03:02.137
So, I don't know.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.599
It doesn't mean anything to me.

03:03.619 --> 03:10.670
I mean, I can't come up with some sort of... But it certainly must have some metaphoric significance for you.

03:11.392 --> 03:11.932
Maybe not.

03:13.295 --> 03:14.136
I don't think it does.

03:14.617 --> 03:16.740
It's just a device that you use in two books.

03:17.421 --> 03:18.783
Yeah.

03:18.803 --> 03:21.808
I mean, I wish I had a more interesting answer, but...

03:22.278 --> 03:23.039
I don't think I do.

03:23.239 --> 03:25.022
I guess maybe that's what I was reaching for.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.604
Yeah, yeah.

03:26.985 --> 03:29.068
No, I don't think I have a more interesting answer than that.

03:29.989 --> 03:34.055
Do you see, no, I've read that you started writing at, what, 27?

03:34.916 --> 03:35.617
Something like that.

03:35.657 --> 03:37.559
That's amazing.

03:37.579 --> 03:38.060
Oh, you mean?

03:38.100 --> 03:47.133
The fact that you started at, you know, some people might consider that young, but I would say that, you know, you'd done other things and tried other things at that point.

03:47.433 --> 03:47.774
Yeah.

03:48.154 --> 03:51.559
And you probably really not considered being a writer or writing was your,

03:52.163 --> 03:55.347
I considered being a writer when I was very young.

03:55.387 --> 03:59.413
I think when I went away to college.

03:59.433 --> 04:00.154
I was a freshman.

04:00.354 --> 04:00.855
Which was?

04:00.875 --> 04:07.364
1968 at Southwestern at Memphis, in Memphis, Tennessee.

04:07.444 --> 04:09.787
Good, Memphis takes me.

04:09.807 --> 04:11.269
Oh, good, good.

04:11.389 --> 04:17.277
Well, that's where I did my freshman year, and it was 1968, which was the year of the sanitation workers' strike.

04:17.982 --> 04:20.405
And the year that Martin Luther King was killed.

04:20.465 --> 04:21.927
See, he was killed in the spring of 68.

04:22.047 --> 04:32.359
And I was a cub reporter on the college newspaper, and I was doing some pieces about the sanitation workers' strike.

04:32.420 --> 04:34.222
And I was caught up in all of that.

04:34.302 --> 04:38.747
I was in the march the day of the riots.

04:39.508 --> 04:46.657
And I was also in my freshman year of school at a time when all this stuff was happening.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.618
So I was very...

04:48.205 --> 04:52.212
caught up in everything that was sort of sweeping the country at the time.

04:55.537 --> 04:57.861
But I also thought, maybe I'll be a writer.

04:58.742 --> 05:00.125
And I wrote a short story.

05:00.205 --> 05:02.048
I was in a freshman English class.

05:02.088 --> 05:04.993
A writer thinking in terms of you were doing some journalism.

05:05.173 --> 05:06.435
A fiction writer, you thought?

05:06.455 --> 05:08.458
Yeah, no, I was thinking about being a fiction writer.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.989
And I wrote a short story for my advanced English class.

05:15.644 --> 05:19.809
And somebody suggested I send it to the Atlantic Monthly, which I did.

05:19.849 --> 05:25.675
And after a few weeks, I got the rejection slip back from the Atlantic Monthly.

05:26.797 --> 05:29.460
And I decided, well, I guess I wasn't meant to be a writer after all.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.442
On the strength of one rejection.

05:31.602 --> 05:31.883
Yeah.

05:32.183 --> 05:34.285
I mean, that's how naive I was about it, you know.

05:34.305 --> 05:36.888
I mean, I just thought, oh, well, this didn't work.

05:38.250 --> 05:43.456
And then I really put the idea on the shelf for many years.

05:44.697 --> 05:45.398
Many years.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.773
So this was 68 years ago?

05:47.853 --> 05:48.474
I was 68.

05:48.494 --> 05:54.241
I mean, you know, back in those days, when I say many years, it seemed like longer than it seems to me now.

05:54.362 --> 05:59.128
So maybe, you know, we're talking about like seven or eight years or something.

05:59.649 --> 06:05.817
Because I think it was in 1975 or 76 that I decided to try my hand at it again.

06:06.742 --> 06:11.049
And in both those instances, it was because somebody had told me I should do it.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.433
In other words, I hadn't a clue what I should do.

06:13.493 --> 06:20.705
I was really like this kind of lost soul in terms of an identity and a career path and all that kind of stuff, you know.

06:22.287 --> 06:29.339
So it was because in my senior year of high school, an English teacher had said, I think you ought to think about being a writer.

06:30.060 --> 06:33.205
And then when I was in college...

06:33.775 --> 06:42.609
another, a college professor in English, I think it was in a Shakespeare course, did the same thing, said to me, you know, I think you ought to think about being a writer.

06:42.849 --> 06:49.379
I guess they had seen some ability or some talent in papers that I was doing for their classes.

06:50.220 --> 06:57.091
And so in both those cases, you know, it was because somebody else had said, and because I was so lost, I just thought, oh, okay, there's an idea.

06:57.271 --> 06:59.735
Well, there certainly is natural talent, yeah.

06:59.755 --> 07:01.538
It's very, it's beautifully written.

07:01.940 --> 07:02.481
material.

07:02.621 --> 07:02.981
Thank you.

07:03.001 --> 07:10.131
Let me say, it's, I mean, I could see reading a paper, I might even say the same thing.

07:10.151 --> 07:12.414
The kid's got some ability, you know.

07:12.754 --> 07:13.174
Yeah.

07:13.415 --> 07:16.278
I'd love to see more, you know, if I can see that.

07:17.260 --> 07:23.668
Let's dispense with the, I mean, I read about the training to be a musician and stage fright.

07:23.868 --> 07:25.591
Maybe if you could give me some quotes on that.

07:25.631 --> 07:26.472
I have other quotes.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.095
I mean, basically correct what I've read about this

07:35.082 --> 07:36.884
fright kind of a thing?

07:37.144 --> 08:02.727
Well, I mean, it's true that I experienced a lot of performance anxiety as a pianist, but if I have anything, I don't know about correct, I mean, if I have anything to say about stage fright, it's something that's been... Performance anxiety is a much... Well, it brings it a little bit down to earth for me, because what happened was that, what happened originally with that was that the New York Times Book Review was

08:03.027 --> 08:32.798
called me up to do a little yeah and well you know how people are always trying to make a story get a story and I mentioned in passing that I had studied music in college and that I'd had stage fright that I'd had performance anxiety when it came to performing and so that was one of the things that you know made me think that maybe I wasn't going to have a career there unless I could somehow get past that

08:33.385 --> 08:38.932
And then the next thing I see is that we owe this book to stage fright.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.275
So it had been like a small detail.

08:41.295 --> 08:42.716
It's taken out by the Washington Post.

08:42.776 --> 08:43.377
Oh, and everybody.

08:43.477 --> 08:45.660
It's not a bad angle.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.901
I promise I won't leave with it.

08:47.422 --> 08:47.903
That's good.

08:48.063 --> 08:48.563
That's good.

08:48.643 --> 08:49.785
I've tried to play it down.

08:49.805 --> 08:50.526
I'll use it.

08:50.546 --> 08:54.691
I can't tell you I won't, because it's valid.

08:54.991 --> 08:56.613
Sure.

08:56.893 --> 09:02.380
Actually, I intend to use it to ask another question, I think, that's more searching.

09:02.900 --> 09:07.845
I give a lot of talks, and I love it, and it doesn't bother me at all.

09:07.905 --> 09:10.908
They go up with notes, you know, I wing it and I do it.

09:13.791 --> 09:23.661
Obviously performance in public rattles you, I guess, a bit, or you have anxious moments about it, I guess, about doing it.

09:24.802 --> 09:28.806
I think that as a writer, however, I think that as a performing artist,

09:29.613 --> 09:32.477
you do get an immediate response from your audience.

09:32.497 --> 09:36.603
You know if you've been good or not, if your work has been well-received.

09:36.623 --> 09:37.565
There's no doubt about it.

09:37.965 --> 09:45.777
As a writer, on the other hand, and as you pointed out earlier, you almost work in a vacuum for a while, don't you, for a long time.

09:45.837 --> 09:52.748
And then, of course, the book is done, and your editor might be reassuring you, but then you really do have to wait, and you're kind of at that point now.

09:53.008 --> 09:56.413
Do you have any anxious moments as a writer?

09:56.765 --> 10:01.830
about the response, or has this allayed the anxiety?

10:02.511 --> 10:04.273
Well, you're talking about two different kinds of anxiety.

10:04.373 --> 10:07.396
One is performance anxiety, which I really don't suffer.

10:08.157 --> 10:11.380
I mean, I just don't... Oh, so that was... I don't have that.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.863
I mean, I think... So that was really my true bit, is that right?

10:16.025 --> 10:23.312
I think if you were to ask me to play the piano in front of an audience now, I'd still, you know, be shaking like a leaf.

10:24.305 --> 10:25.346
It's just not the same.

10:25.807 --> 10:27.569
I can do the same thing.

10:27.629 --> 10:32.075
I get up and talk to large audiences without notes and so on and so forth.

10:32.095 --> 10:32.536
It doesn't bother you.

10:32.856 --> 10:33.857
It doesn't bother me at all.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.399
I mean, I'm very comfortable doing it.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.324
I mean, I may experience a little nerves right before I start talking.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.689
It really did, and I think it's completely different.

10:42.809 --> 10:51.460
I mean, actually performing a piece of music is different from reading something that's already been written or just...

10:51.794 --> 10:56.160
I don't know, talking is completely different to me from performing.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.045
Yeah, but I'm trying to make the leap also to the writing.

10:59.786 --> 11:00.106
Yeah.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.249
Because that is performing.

11:02.991 --> 11:03.431
Yeah.

11:04.633 --> 11:08.899
And it is intended to generate a response.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.802
Yeah.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.508
I guess I'm saying, do you have performance anxiety about your writing?

11:14.748 --> 11:14.848
Yeah.

11:15.740 --> 11:16.961
Well, sort of, I guess.

11:16.981 --> 11:21.645
I mean, I guess I have sort of some form of that, but it just feels like a completely different thing.

11:22.406 --> 11:27.570
I mean, you know, trying to start something new, there's always a little anxiety about, oh, is this going to work?

11:27.690 --> 11:31.093
And, you know, there are all those kinds of feelings.

11:31.454 --> 11:45.426
Right now, you know, as you pointed out, being at this place where I have a book coming out and I'm anticipating what the public response is going to be, that produces some

11:45.862 --> 11:47.644
late night anxiety.

11:48.224 --> 11:51.847
You know, I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night and think about it.

11:52.748 --> 11:53.188
Do you really?

11:53.469 --> 11:54.750
But not very much.

11:54.830 --> 11:59.834
I mean, you know, this is my third time out and I feel a little more seasoned.

11:59.994 --> 12:11.204
I also feel like I have a lot clearer view of how much luck is involved in this crazy thing, you know, that's happening.

12:12.785 --> 12:14.907
When I wrote The Music Room, my first book,

12:15.511 --> 12:30.316
I thought it was kind of a quiet, small literary book that might, if I was lucky, somebody would buy it for the minimal amount that was paid for first novels.

12:31.277 --> 12:37.688
And if I was even luckier, it might get a little attention in some literary settings.

12:38.495 --> 12:42.639
And then it took off like wildfire, you know, and we sold film rights for six figures.

12:42.739 --> 12:44.220
It was a New York Times bestseller.

12:44.261 --> 12:47.624
It was all, I mean, you know, just, and nobody anticipated that.

12:48.545 --> 13:04.620
Then for my second book, for which I got a nice big fat advance based on what had happened with The Music Room, it was actually brought out as a bestseller, you know, with lots of, you know, promotion behind it and

13:05.123 --> 13:10.710
And I just got caught up in that whole sort of scenario of, yeah, why not?

13:10.730 --> 13:12.092
I'm going to have another bestseller.

13:13.434 --> 13:20.142
And it didn't, although I think that it's every bit as good as The Music Room, and in some ways even better.

13:20.262 --> 13:22.625
I think it's a more mature novel than The Music Room.

13:23.747 --> 13:29.114
It fell a little flat by comparison in the marketplace.

13:29.134 --> 13:31.637
Say it's sales and marketplace, but how about reviews?

13:32.123 --> 13:37.871
reviews were, with a couple of exceptions, almost universally rave reviews.

13:38.392 --> 13:41.056
And it was more widely reviewed than The Music Room.

13:41.877 --> 13:42.999
Go figure, huh?

13:43.019 --> 13:44.341
Go figure is exactly right.

13:44.601 --> 13:51.411
And so that was very hard for me to go through, you know, that one disappointment after another, after another, after another.

13:51.451 --> 13:56.819
No film rights, no, you know, low sales and all this kind of stuff.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.903
I had sort of an opposite experience in a lot of ways.

14:00.119 --> 14:03.883
In a commercial way, I had an opposite experience from what I had with the music room.

14:04.143 --> 14:12.350
So the third time out, it's sort of like I've seen both, you know, pictures, and I just feel like, well, yeah, now I know.

14:12.951 --> 14:27.004
So when I begin to feel that anxiety about, oh, I wonder what's going to happen with the book, and I wonder, you know, am I going to get creamed in the press, so forth, what I'm able to do is,

14:27.423 --> 14:31.469
remember that this really is something that nobody can predict.

14:32.150 --> 14:35.175
So I'm able to let it go a lot quicker, you know.

14:35.195 --> 14:38.921
So I'm not like lying awake for hours churning about this stuff.

14:38.941 --> 14:40.663
Sometimes I think about it briefly.

14:41.244 --> 14:42.646
And then I think, oh, yeah, well.

14:42.687 --> 14:47.113
It does sound like that the concern is more commercial than it is literary.

14:48.736 --> 14:50.779
It absolutely is more commercial than literary.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.002
I mean, I've done my literary job.

14:53.063 --> 14:53.363
Yeah.

14:53.461 --> 14:54.202
You know what I mean?

14:54.282 --> 15:02.031
I wrote the best book that I feel that I could write, and I got really good advice along the way, and I improved it.

15:03.833 --> 15:22.776
And I just feel like, you know, it's not, I don't by any means think it's the greatest book anybody's ever written, or I don't have any kind of superlative notions about the book, but I do feel like, you know, it has some merit, and I did the best I could.

15:23.482 --> 15:30.148
And I think I even see some of the ways in which it's limited, as all books are, ultimately.

15:31.550 --> 15:35.814
But that's not... And then somebody's going to get it or they're not going to get it.

15:36.574 --> 15:38.136
And I have no control over that.

15:39.397 --> 15:44.862
And I have been able to see that when you... Maybe you've seen this, too.

15:45.223 --> 15:50.428
When you write a book, that you're going to get a very wide range of reactions.

15:50.488 --> 15:53.050
It's such a subjective...

15:53.232 --> 15:55.816
this business of reviewing books.

15:56.357 --> 16:05.271
You know, people are bringing their life experience and their hang-ups and their pet peeves and their buttons to be pushed and all that kind of stuff.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.275
Yeah, their baggage to the process.

16:07.896 --> 16:18.092
So the exact same story is going to strike one person in a way that's going to make them absolutely hate it and dismiss it.

16:18.494 --> 16:20.777
and another person's going to absolutely love it.

16:21.037 --> 16:30.290
Martin Nemus, you know, he basically expects, told me, that, you know, 50%, you want, you see, the expectation is 50% are going to like it, and 50% aren't.

16:30.330 --> 16:47.573
I mean, the critics, if that's what you get, you figure, great, that's, I'm doing my job, for precisely the reasons that you just... I've been really lucky, you know, with reviewers, because I have, I mean, it's got nothing like 50-50, I mean, it's been much more, much more weighted on the side of the

16:48.059 --> 17:15.636
favorable reviews and um but you know I'm at a point right now with this new book which is coming out in a couple of months um where there's been one well you saw obviously saw the PW review which was a rave from the first word to the last and then I guess there was a Kirkus review that was really Kirkus is tough um I think the word was nasty was a word that was um

17:16.072 --> 17:16.973
passed on to me.

17:17.113 --> 17:19.876
I have not seen it, and I was told, don't bother looking at it.

17:20.537 --> 17:25.382
Kirkus is so unpredictable.

17:25.502 --> 17:31.169
I had great Kirkus and a really bitchy PW, which surprised me.

17:31.189 --> 17:32.450
Oh, isn't that interesting?

17:32.470 --> 17:36.795
Well, that's what I mean then.

17:36.835 --> 17:38.136
You see exactly what I mean then.

17:38.177 --> 17:43.142
It's about who gets it, who gets assigned it.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.886
All that stuff.

17:44.906 --> 17:47.369
That's what I mean about so much luck involved, you know.

17:48.330 --> 17:53.355
So, you know, it's a hard place to be, and I'll be glad when it's over.

17:54.296 --> 18:00.803
The sort of waiting I find to be a little difficult, because it occupies my mind a little bit.

18:01.984 --> 18:05.387
But as I said, it's a lot easier the third time out than it was before.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.830
Let's talk, you said that...

18:08.232 --> 18:12.536
your first effort was rejected by the, was it The Atlantic, I guess?

18:12.556 --> 18:12.937
Yeah.

18:12.957 --> 18:15.479
So then how did you go from there to publishing with The New Yorker?

18:15.499 --> 18:17.962
I mean, your first story was published with The New Yorker, is that right?

18:17.982 --> 18:20.144
Yeah, my first published story was in The New Yorker.

18:20.545 --> 18:21.185
And when was that?

18:21.245 --> 18:22.427
Do you remember the name of the story?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.749
The name of the story was Lullaby.

18:26.050 --> 18:26.411
Uh-huh.

18:26.611 --> 18:27.372
Lullaby.

18:27.392 --> 18:28.533
Uh-huh.

18:28.553 --> 18:34.519
And what year was it published?

18:34.539 --> 18:37.362
It must have been 1979 or 1980.

18:37.713 --> 18:42.298
somewhere around in there, because I know I'd just gone back to graduate school to study creative writing.

18:43.119 --> 18:50.486
And I'd done one semester in the program, and then I sold his story to the New Yorker.

18:52.268 --> 18:53.910
We can find out what year it was.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.271
I'll give you a call at some point.

18:55.391 --> 18:56.472
Okay.

18:56.653 --> 18:57.574
They'd like to know that.

18:57.734 --> 19:01.898
Oh, I can find out before you leave, because I'm sure I have a copy of it somewhere.

19:02.755 --> 19:04.037
So how did you get back on track?

19:04.077 --> 19:09.006
I mean, okay, fine, I wrote a story, they don't want it, now I'm not going to write.

19:09.026 --> 19:10.588
But then you came back to it.

19:10.608 --> 19:27.918
Well, you know, I did a lot of stuff that was kind of like, you know, floundering around, getting lost in the counterculture, going out to California, doing drugs, you know, just being a real, genuine, bona fide lost soul.

19:28.379 --> 19:28.459
Hmm.

19:28.743 --> 19:32.967
for a long time and really still didn't have a clue what I was going to do with my life.

19:34.689 --> 19:38.672
Eventually, I ended up back in New York, still just being a wanderer.

19:40.154 --> 19:49.543
And after living in New York for a little while, I enrolled in Brooklyn College and studied music because I had studied the piano as a child.

19:49.603 --> 19:53.967
So again, I'm like grasping, you know, for things where I thought, well, here's something I could do.

19:53.987 --> 19:55.408
I have some musical talent.

19:56.705 --> 20:02.795
And by the time I finished the music education, I just thought, there's nothing about this that I want to do.

20:02.835 --> 20:08.604
I'm not interested in teaching music in a school somewhere.

20:08.644 --> 20:13.151
I was sort of disenchanted with the whole notion of it.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.635
So that's when it occurred to me to try writing again.

20:15.675 --> 20:20.402
And I guess I was a little more serious about it then.

20:20.462 --> 20:22.345
I was a little more mature.

20:22.365 --> 20:24.248
Not a lot more mature, but a little more.

20:24.802 --> 20:32.131
and sort of understood that you didn't quit on the basis of one rejection of one story.

20:33.233 --> 20:46.790
So I started writing stories and reading stories by people that had been told to me were masters of the short story.

20:47.731 --> 20:54.640
And in 1980, I enrolled in a creative writing program for graduate school.

20:54.772 --> 20:56.974
That was at Goddard College in Vermont.

20:58.235 --> 21:02.560
And I studied with Frank Conroy my first semester.

21:02.900 --> 21:07.604
I learned everything from him and published a story in The New Yorker.

21:07.664 --> 21:09.766
It all happened really fast, and I thought, cool.

21:10.147 --> 21:10.707
How did that work?

21:10.727 --> 21:11.488
Did you submit it?

21:11.508 --> 21:12.709
Did Frank submit it?

21:12.729 --> 21:13.610
No, I submitted it.

21:14.111 --> 21:18.895
I submitted it, but it was a story that I had written for him during the term that we were working together.

21:21.778 --> 21:23.800
Did he encourage you to submit it?

21:24.488 --> 21:25.329
I don't think so.

21:25.389 --> 21:28.472
I don't remember his encouraging me to submit it.

21:29.774 --> 21:31.476
He clearly must have liked it.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.138
I think he did.

21:33.158 --> 21:36.561
Yeah, he liked me.

21:36.601 --> 21:37.442
He liked my work.

21:37.482 --> 21:38.884
He saw something in it.

21:39.585 --> 21:45.471
He was a mentor for me while I worked with him.

21:45.772 --> 21:53.280
And then, of course, what proceeded from that was this sort of odd thing of having...

21:53.446 --> 21:58.132
published your first published story in The New Yorker, and then they didn't take anything for eight years.

21:58.552 --> 21:58.792
Exactly.

21:59.313 --> 21:59.413
Yeah.

22:00.474 --> 22:04.479
So that's its own sort of... And did you submit a lot of things afterwards?

22:04.599 --> 22:05.701
Oh, I submitted everything.

22:05.821 --> 22:09.405
Everything I wrote went to them, and there were lots of close calls.

22:09.465 --> 22:15.873
There were plenty of stories along the way that they would send back and say, we really love this.

22:16.033 --> 22:17.074
Would you consider...

22:17.425 --> 22:31.524
you know, changing this, this, this, and this, and, you know, slut that I am, I would change everything they asked me to and send it back in, and then they'd say, oh, gee, you know, that really doesn't quite work to do that that way, does it?

22:32.506 --> 22:32.706
You know?

22:32.726 --> 22:34.609
Were you working with different editors each time?

22:34.969 --> 22:40.216
I worked with, not each time, but over the course of those years, I worked with a few different editors.

22:40.997 --> 22:45.103
I ended up, I think, working with Fran Kiernan, who...

22:45.556 --> 22:55.866
Then, when she left The New Yorker, went to work as a book editor at Tickner and Fields, who then was the editor who bought The Music Room.

22:55.886 --> 22:56.607
How do you spell her name?

22:57.748 --> 23:01.772
Kiernan is K-I-E-R-N-A-N, first name Fran.

23:02.013 --> 23:05.937
So you had worked with her.

23:05.997 --> 23:08.399
Yeah, but she never bought a story.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.460
But that's fine.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.702
So then what happened?

23:11.122 --> 23:14.145
Tell me how the first novel came to be.

23:14.513 --> 23:16.436
Did you have an agent at this point?

23:16.456 --> 23:16.857
Oh, yeah.

23:16.877 --> 23:20.502
I got an agent pretty early on because, see, I had put some stories together.

23:20.642 --> 23:24.508
One of them was published in The New Yorker, and a few were published in... That was Lullaby.

23:24.648 --> 23:25.089
Lullaby.

23:25.109 --> 23:27.713
In 79 or 80, and we'll check the date.

23:27.733 --> 23:35.585
There was one other story that had been published in Mademoiselle, and then there were some stories that had been published in Small Literary Quarterlies.

23:36.306 --> 23:40.993
So I had imagined myself as a story writer who would bring out a collection of stories.

23:41.362 --> 23:49.212
And it was during the time when there was kind of a, you know, stories were getting a little more attention for a while with Raymond Carver and people like that.

23:50.154 --> 23:53.658
And so it seemed like a real possibility for me.

23:53.678 --> 23:54.519
Edie and Toby Wolfe.

23:54.620 --> 23:56.082
Right, right.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.864
It was kind of enjoying a little heyday.

23:58.905 --> 24:07.437
And what happened universally was that I got an agent who was Gail Hockman at Brandt & Brandt.

24:07.457 --> 24:07.757
Spelt.

24:08.378 --> 24:15.729
H-O-C-H-M-A-N, first name Gail, G-A-I-L, at Brant and Brant, B-R-A-N-D-T.

24:16.069 --> 24:16.950
This is in New York.

24:17.952 --> 24:27.285
And she sent my manuscript of stories around to a lot of different publishers.

24:27.466 --> 24:35.938
And almost universally, everybody said, you know, these are great, you're great, please let us see your novels.

24:37.235 --> 24:40.999
very hard to launch an unknown writer with a collection of stories.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.060
Absolutely true.

24:42.080 --> 24:52.451
They were looking for, you know, even if it had been like stories that had a kind of common theme, like they were all about characters in the same town, or they were all... Packages.

24:52.852 --> 24:56.936
Yeah, you know, I mean, but they, you know, they were, they were all different.

24:56.976 --> 24:57.957
Still wouldn't sell.

24:57.977 --> 25:03.343
Yeah, so, um, so everybody passed, and, um,

25:04.505 --> 25:08.633
And so I really, you know, I finally decided, okay, I guess I've got to write a novel.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.176
I didn't really especially want to.

25:10.216 --> 25:11.338
Why?

25:12.180 --> 25:12.521
I don't know.

25:12.541 --> 25:16.849
It just wasn't a form that I read very much.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.094
I didn't have any great appreciation for it.

25:20.376 --> 25:26.007
And I couldn't figure out how to.

25:26.257 --> 25:28.820
write something that was extended, you know?

25:28.840 --> 25:31.422
I mean, I just couldn't... So your mindset was the shorter form?

25:31.442 --> 25:32.143
It really was.

25:32.463 --> 25:33.004
It really was.

25:33.024 --> 25:35.886
This was your career goal then, basically, as a story writer.

25:35.966 --> 25:36.667
Yeah, I think so.

25:37.148 --> 25:44.395
I mean, insofar as I had a career goal, I think, you know, I don't know, I mean, in a way, I really didn't know what I was doing.

25:44.435 --> 25:50.641
I just knew that this was something that I rather enjoyed doing, writing stories, and so I'd keep doing it for a while.

25:51.542 --> 25:55.926
I think I had some vague notion that I might be interested in writing drama at some point,

25:57.357 --> 26:09.134
But what became clear, you know, from all the input that I got, all the feedback that I got, was that I really needed to write a novel.

26:09.755 --> 26:12.499
So I did.

26:12.759 --> 26:19.429
Very, you know, career-oriented in a way that a lot of my generation was.

26:19.629 --> 26:21.492
Yeah, right.

26:21.910 --> 26:27.898
But there was a piece in the New York Times just a couple weeks ago about, you know, the dearth of Sirius Brownler on Broadway.

26:27.918 --> 26:29.079
I know, I know.

26:29.900 --> 26:32.444
I think it's all part of this whole dumbing down thing.

26:32.684 --> 26:33.405
I do too.

26:33.966 --> 26:34.967
I do too.

26:35.007 --> 26:37.871
Which I'm writing about in my new book, by the way.

26:38.211 --> 26:41.415
From here I'm going over to do an interview with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

26:41.856 --> 26:42.877
Right, right.

26:42.897 --> 26:49.185
Well, your book being, you know, taken off their list is part of the whole dumbing down thing, you know.

26:49.345 --> 26:50.567
It was a total arrogance.

26:54.243 --> 27:03.004
Well, doesn't it have something to do with the fact that now publishing, like everything else, is owned by all the same people?

27:03.445 --> 27:03.586
Yeah.

27:04.167 --> 27:04.789
That's right.

27:05.390 --> 27:09.400
I mean, that's why it seems to be so pervasive, because...

27:09.785 --> 27:11.907
Everything is owned by the same four people.

27:11.927 --> 27:14.350
Yeah, but they also think in a global sense.

27:14.370 --> 27:17.414
It's not just the book, it's this and that, and the CD thing.

27:17.494 --> 27:18.795
Because they own the same things.

27:18.815 --> 27:20.237
Because they all own the same things.

27:20.257 --> 27:20.497
Right.

27:20.597 --> 27:24.322
So they're looking at all the sort of different divisions of their company.

27:24.362 --> 27:28.186
I don't know if you watch CNN, but down below it's now a Time Warner company.

27:28.206 --> 27:29.327
They make it very clear.

27:29.888 --> 27:34.794
And then all of a sudden now it's CNN, SI, Sports Illustrated, which is a Time Warner thing.

27:34.814 --> 27:34.974
I know.

27:34.994 --> 27:35.134
I know.

27:35.502 --> 27:40.090
they do features on the time and of the year, which they've never, you know, I'm saying.

27:40.711 --> 27:41.352
Right, right.

27:41.372 --> 27:45.258
All this incestuous kind of behavior.

27:45.458 --> 27:50.286
Yeah, and there's some sort of at least quasi-serious repercussions.

27:50.306 --> 27:58.179
I mean, aside from the sort of cultural repercussions that has to do with what you call dumbing down of the culture, there's some sort of more specific.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.463
I heard a report recently on the radio about

28:01.118 --> 28:07.230
I don't know the details exactly, but there was a movie that was based on the book.

28:07.750 --> 28:15.278
I think it was called Strange Justice that was about Clarence Thomas, a serious book about the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas.

28:15.759 --> 28:24.928
I guess that there was a movie made for TV, and maybe it was a Ted Turner movie, and then when they merged with Time Warner or something.

28:24.948 --> 28:26.630
They were basically bought by Time Warner.

28:27.111 --> 28:32.897
Yeah, so when that happened, then it turned out that Time Warner had some serious business in the court,

28:33.383 --> 28:34.825
So the movie was pulled.

28:34.985 --> 28:39.070
They couldn't show the movie because it shows Clarence Thomas in the not-so-great light.

28:39.892 --> 28:44.798
You know, so then we have, like, really sort of, like, what is, you know... What are their ethical considerations?

28:44.818 --> 28:47.822
Real, serious ethical considerations, yeah.

28:47.842 --> 28:55.912
I don't mean myself talking, but... Okay, so let's get back on to how this first novel came to be.

28:56.894 --> 28:58.796
How you came to write it and sell it.

28:58.816 --> 29:01.720
Well, you know, I'm having a little trouble remembering...

29:02.155 --> 29:07.124
the exact details of the music room, but I completed it.

29:08.466 --> 29:10.410
And where did you write it?

29:10.430 --> 29:11.873
Where were you living at that time?

29:11.893 --> 29:14.638
We had moved to the Boston area by then.

29:14.918 --> 29:17.202
We weren't in this house, but we were nearby.

29:17.262 --> 29:21.951
And I wrote it, and I wrote it really pretty fast.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.055
I think the first draft I was written in a year.

29:25.237 --> 29:25.918
And...

29:26.641 --> 29:29.285
What I can't recall is exactly why it went.

29:29.605 --> 29:36.195
What I remember was that it went to Knopp first, and now I can't remember exactly why it went there first.

29:36.255 --> 29:37.276
No, it's a nice house.

29:38.418 --> 29:42.364
But it did, and they were interested, actually.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.166
Gordon Lish is there.

29:44.307 --> 29:45.889
Yeah.

29:45.909 --> 29:55.703
It was an editor named Bobby... Anyway, I can't remember her last name right now.

29:56.307 --> 30:04.597
But she was wonderful because what she did was, her criticisms of the book ultimately helped me a lot in revising it.

30:05.478 --> 30:07.481
And I revised it considerably.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.865
I mean, essentially the last third of the book was completely rewritten.

30:12.327 --> 30:21.378
And then I guess we were sort of obligated then to go back to Knopf with the new version.

30:21.438 --> 30:23.821
And they kind of sat on it for a while.

30:23.861 --> 30:25.183
They kind of, you know...

30:25.703 --> 30:32.195
Somebody was out of town, and, you know, they were puffing and puffing, because I know six months.

30:32.556 --> 30:40.270
Yeah, they liked it, but they had a lot of questions, and the questions that they were asking I felt a little impatient with,

30:40.857 --> 30:56.056
And I guess in general, I can remember saying to my agent at that point, I said, you know what would be nice would be if I had the feeling that they wanted to publish the book, that they were going to publish it with some enthusiasm because they loved it.

30:56.677 --> 31:02.464
And my agent, being the sort of unhyping kind of person that she is, said, well, you know, it's a quiet book.

31:02.564 --> 31:10.594
And I kind of slunk away with my tail between my legs thinking, oh, I wrote a quiet book for me, and I guess I can't expect any more.

31:11.215 --> 31:12.237
But that was the way I felt.

31:12.297 --> 31:16.385
I felt like they were doing me a big favor, you know, by publishing it.

31:17.307 --> 31:29.330
But then they continued to sit on it, and in the meantime, this person I knew, Fran Kiernan, was working at Tickner and Fields and wanted to see the book.

31:30.392 --> 31:34.219
And so... You'd heard this yourself or through your agent, or...?

31:34.334 --> 31:50.531
Well, you know, Fran by then was a friend, and so I knew that she was interested in seeing the book, but she also knew that we were obligated to come up at the time, and she just asked, you know, if they turned it down, I'd like to see it.

31:51.252 --> 32:00.021
So I think at some point my agent gave them an ultimatum and said, we've got to have an answer this weekend, or we're pulling it and going somewhere else, and

32:00.777 --> 32:05.203
and whoever it was who could sign off on it was out of town.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.726
It worked out, actually.

32:07.747 --> 32:08.367
It worked out.

32:08.508 --> 32:18.101
It worked out really, you know, in my favor, I think, because then I went to Tigner and Fields on a Friday.

32:18.221 --> 32:21.325
Fran took it home and read it over the weekend, and they made an offer on Monday.

32:22.246 --> 32:22.547
Wow.

32:22.767 --> 32:27.173
Which showed, you know, which that's me, which showed...

32:27.457 --> 32:29.700
the kind of enthusiasm that I'd been missing.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.104
I mean, they really loved the book, and they wanted to buy it.

32:32.684 --> 32:33.606
Isn't that something, huh?

32:33.626 --> 32:33.886
Yeah.

32:33.966 --> 32:34.747
Was it a good offer?

32:35.308 --> 32:37.351
Well, it was more than I expected to get at the time.

32:37.391 --> 32:40.596
It was $25,000 for a first novel by an unknown.

32:40.656 --> 32:42.178
Nothing wrong with that.

32:42.198 --> 32:42.378
Yeah.

32:42.979 --> 32:55.877
And then a whole lot of things followed, you know, which were exciting, which was, you know, like a lengthy excerpt was taken by The New Yorker, and, you know, sometimes...

32:56.110 --> 33:03.963
Down the line, Goober Peters bought the film rights, optioned the film rights for a lot of money.

33:03.983 --> 33:04.784
Did they ever produce it?

33:05.586 --> 33:18.287
No, they never did, and it changed hands a few times, and ultimately the rights were bought outright by the producer, Scott Rudin, who I think is still at Paramount.

33:19.263 --> 33:23.268
And, you know, it's languished there for all these years.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.791
But you got a pretty decent piece of change, though.

33:25.811 --> 33:26.392
Oh, yeah.

33:26.712 --> 33:27.313
Yeah, I did.

33:27.333 --> 33:27.854
Six figures?

33:27.874 --> 33:29.235
Yes, yes.

33:29.656 --> 33:31.759
High six figures, low six figures?

33:31.919 --> 33:40.930
They paid, I think, I don't know if I want to say the figure, less than half a million, but more than a quarter of a million.

33:41.010 --> 33:41.491
There you go.

33:42.372 --> 33:44.554
And... That can make your day.

33:44.915 --> 33:46.177
Yeah, it made my day.

33:46.937 --> 33:49.000
And they...

33:50.060 --> 33:58.087
And then what I know about that is that Scott Rudin was very enthusiastic about the book.

33:58.147 --> 33:58.907
He loved the book.

33:59.388 --> 34:08.255
He hired the playwright, the New York playwright, John Robin Bates, to write the screenplay.

34:08.856 --> 34:11.098
John Robin Bates wrote a screenplay.

34:11.818 --> 34:19.645
I have not seen the screenplay, but through the grapevine I heard that it was good and that Scott Rudin loved it.

34:19.912 --> 34:20.473
What happens?

34:20.493 --> 34:21.414
Where's the green light?

34:21.834 --> 34:25.739
So it may or may not ever see production, but it might.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.221
So what kind of money into something?

34:28.281 --> 34:29.202
What are they thinking?

34:29.222 --> 34:36.451
Well, I just think that somebody who's as successful as Scott Rudin has a lot of projects going at once.

34:37.131 --> 34:43.679
And so I think, you know, for whatever reasons, some things take priorities over others.

34:43.759 --> 34:47.623
And I really honestly don't know whether this will happen, but

34:47.941 --> 34:56.757
There's a production bonus in my contract, so I get another little piece of change if they actually do go to production.

34:56.777 --> 34:58.019
How long do they own these rates?

34:58.419 --> 34:58.840
Forever.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.549
It's not an option in this case that we actually sold it.

35:03.589 --> 35:05.833
It's not like 10 grand or 20 grand either.

35:05.973 --> 35:06.293
Right.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.315
It's not an option.

35:07.335 --> 35:08.157
Right.

35:08.177 --> 35:08.938
So they own it.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.585
Did you get similar action with the second novel?

35:12.625 --> 35:12.885
No.

35:13.372 --> 35:18.699
With the second novel, nobody bought the film rights, although we tried to sell it.

35:19.039 --> 35:21.262
We tried to sell the film rights.

35:21.603 --> 35:34.920
Because the music room had been bought for film rights, we were anticipating selling film rights to the second book, and a lot of producers and a lot of studios were really interested in seeing it.

35:34.940 --> 35:35.681
You know how they are.

35:35.721 --> 35:40.527
They call frequently and say, when is he going to be done?

35:40.567 --> 35:42.349
We can't wait to read his book, and da-da-da.

35:42.717 --> 35:44.840
So, you know, you can get caught up in that.

35:44.900 --> 35:46.403
They want a one-page pitch, too.

35:46.984 --> 35:51.170
Well, I think that they're actually interested in seeing, in reading the book.

35:51.431 --> 35:59.003
But I also get the sense that they're all interested in, like, getting it first.

35:59.884 --> 36:06.154
And so some of the enthusiasm is about, you know, getting to see it first.

36:07.396 --> 36:10.581
But in any case...

36:11.320 --> 36:18.882
You know, School for the Blind was about old people, and old people really don't play very well in Hollywood.

36:19.043 --> 36:23.997
I mean, if you think about it, it's sort of amusing.

36:24.196 --> 36:32.143
You know, kind of like, it's amusing to see how... Sunshine Boys are the... Yeah, yeah, or Grumpy Old Men.

36:32.163 --> 36:33.064
Grumpy Old Men.

36:33.084 --> 36:39.089
Oh, it was the one with Hume Cronin and Jessica Tandy, Delicate Balance, or whatever.

36:39.290 --> 36:41.071
That was an L.B.

36:41.091 --> 36:41.852
play, wasn't it, the old people?

36:41.872 --> 36:42.793
Yeah.

36:42.813 --> 36:47.017
But yeah, you know, there's this kind of take in... Very rarely do you see it, actually.

36:47.457 --> 36:50.680
You see it very rarely, because it's not big box office.

36:50.700 --> 36:51.561
Driving Miss Daisy.

36:51.741 --> 36:54.203
Yeah, well, that was the exception, you know, because it was a...

36:54.672 --> 37:03.624
It had an old character, but for the most part, I don't think that their big box office in Hollywood was not very interested in the old people.

37:04.845 --> 37:06.367
I thought it was tight, though.

37:06.588 --> 37:07.449
It was nice.

37:07.469 --> 37:10.513
It's a nice, tight kind of a narrative.

37:10.713 --> 37:12.556
I think it would make a great movie.

37:13.076 --> 37:13.897
I do.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.720
Do you write visually, by the way?

37:15.760 --> 37:16.661
Very visually.

37:17.022 --> 37:21.928
And a lot of times when I'm writing novels, I see it as a movie in my head.

37:22.094 --> 37:23.816
I really do, yeah.

37:23.836 --> 37:29.121
I mean, not complete with actors in the roles, but I see the scenes, yeah.

37:30.002 --> 37:49.182
And that works well for me, because it seems to me if there's a kind of cinematic sensibility going on in my mind when I'm writing it, then I'm bringing a visual aspect to the prose that is important, I think, in good fiction.

37:50.208 --> 37:54.032
So, let me just dispense with, it was Fran who bought it.

37:54.553 --> 37:55.694
Did she edit it also?

37:55.714 --> 37:57.976
She line edited it.

37:58.197 --> 38:04.844
She line edited it the way that, you know, New Yorker editors line edit, you know, manuscripts of the New Yorker.

38:05.785 --> 38:06.826
And so it was great.

38:07.006 --> 38:07.787
I couldn't have had.

38:07.867 --> 38:08.768
I mean, it was wonderful.

38:09.049 --> 38:13.493
And was she also the editor for your second book?

38:13.674 --> 38:13.914
No.

38:13.934 --> 38:15.375
No.

38:15.656 --> 38:19.540
It's kind of a complicated story, but while she,

38:19.975 --> 38:30.784
She was the editor on The Music Room, but while The Music Room, before The Music Room was published, she left Tickner and Fields, just quit.

38:32.626 --> 38:39.312
And then, so I guess in that sense, it was kind of orphaned at Tickner and Fields.

38:39.492 --> 38:42.454
At that point, John Sterling stepped in.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.156
But the editing was done, thank goodness.

38:44.176 --> 38:45.457
But the editing was done.

38:45.517 --> 38:49.240
Or maybe it wasn't completed, but we made an arrangement.

38:49.507 --> 38:53.072
that though she was no longer working with them... That's the definition.

38:53.112 --> 38:53.993
Yeah, okay.

38:55.776 --> 39:00.863
That though she was no longer with them, that she would see the editing to completion of the book.

39:00.883 --> 39:06.952
So John Sterling stepped in and took over the book, and that's how it became a Houghton Mifflin book.

39:07.933 --> 39:09.836
And it was published as a Houghton Mifflin book.

39:10.356 --> 39:16.846
But he wasn't the editor on the music room, but he became my editor, and then so he was the editor for the second book.

39:16.886 --> 39:17.927
Which explains why you...

39:18.363 --> 39:19.644
You're with a new publisher now.

39:19.664 --> 39:20.846
Right, because I followed John.

39:20.866 --> 39:21.747
You followed John.

39:21.767 --> 39:22.027
Right.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.490
So we've taken care of the editor and the agent.

39:24.550 --> 39:25.911
Do you still have the same agent?

39:26.392 --> 39:27.774
Yes, I do.

39:27.794 --> 39:31.798
Okay, so we've taken care of editor, agent, and just thinking of the things that they like.

39:31.818 --> 39:32.219
Right.

39:32.659 --> 39:33.460
Yeah, yeah.

39:33.480 --> 39:37.184
Do you have a sense of what the sales figures were for the first two books?

39:37.204 --> 39:37.865
No, I don't.

39:38.426 --> 39:40.087
I mean, if I ever did, I've forgotten.

39:40.107 --> 39:45.113
I find all that to be really sort of...

39:45.380 --> 39:48.324
It's better if I don't pay very much attention to it.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.488
Okay, but how many printings?

39:51.508 --> 39:59.458
Well, you know, The Music Room, being a first novel by an unknown, went through a lot of printings, but they were small printings.

39:59.618 --> 40:13.675
Yeah, and then I think that School for the Blind came out with a large printing, so there were a lot of leftovers or remainders.

40:14.236 --> 40:15.117
Yeah, um...

40:15.738 --> 40:19.923
And there were no subsequent printings, because they printed more than they needed the first time out.

40:21.826 --> 40:23.468
But sales figures, I just don't.

40:23.949 --> 40:26.091
Okay, well, if you had it, that would be good.

40:26.372 --> 40:27.874
I can get it elsewhere.

40:30.877 --> 40:41.391
You mentioned earlier, and I ask the question only because I find it relevant to the themes of the books, that you went through a period of self-destructive behavior,

40:43.295 --> 41:08.880
and drinking are these things that are you drawing on your own experience and are these things that are being well inevitably yeah you know I mean I don't think that I'm I don't feel like I'm writing autobiographical fiction because the situations and the characters and

41:09.367 --> 41:15.195
The plights and everything are so far away from my own life in all the particulars.

41:15.956 --> 41:26.611
But inevitably, in the area of characterization, some things come in that are taken from my own life and from my own experience.

41:28.353 --> 41:37.405
But this, apparently, is a matter of great concern for you, this understanding of self-destructive behavior.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.547
Yeah, well, I'm really...

41:38.712 --> 41:46.600
I mean, I think I feel at this point after finishing Face at the Window that I'm done with it and I don't want to do it anymore.

41:46.640 --> 41:51.244
I'm tired of it and I have a sense that people are tired of hearing about it, too.

41:51.264 --> 41:52.505
Do you feel that you understand it now?

41:52.525 --> 41:55.849
Is it something that you've had to exercise in any kind of a way?

41:56.609 --> 41:57.370
Oh, yeah, sure.

41:57.390 --> 42:00.633
I mean, it's something that I've had to come to terms with in myself.

42:01.734 --> 42:06.559
So, you know, when I'm writing about it, I think one of the reasons I'm writing about it is because

42:06.961 --> 42:15.634
I'm figuring it out and I'm analyzing it and contemplating it and, you know, and in that sense, exercising it.

42:16.415 --> 42:34.401
There are, in each of your books, there certainly is plot, a pretty good plot, and you do have a sense of mystery even, and almost even the detective genre comes into some, you know, I mean, trying to put new things out here.

42:34.421 --> 42:34.521
Yeah.

42:35.210 --> 42:38.134
Is this something that's been mindfully worked into your fiction?

42:38.594 --> 42:43.840
Mindfully in the sense that it has felt necessary to me.

42:43.860 --> 42:45.703
I mean, there's a mystery in all of your novels.

42:45.723 --> 42:46.584
Yeah, yeah.

42:46.744 --> 42:49.427
Well, I think there'll be probably one in my next one, too.

42:50.248 --> 42:51.890
But you're not a mystery writer.

42:52.210 --> 42:57.557
I'm not a mystery writer, but... Although we have a mystery writer here, you know, as a character.

42:57.577 --> 42:58.878
Yeah, yeah.

42:59.920 --> 43:00.981
My wife is...

43:01.822 --> 43:05.347
writing her first novel, and it's a bona fide... Oh, really?

43:05.367 --> 43:07.070
It's a bona fide mystery, yeah.

43:08.111 --> 43:10.415
So... Your wife's your writer?

43:11.096 --> 43:11.376
Mm-hmm.

43:11.396 --> 43:15.622
Yeah, yeah.

43:15.642 --> 43:16.423
What was I saying?

43:16.784 --> 43:18.246
We were talking about mysteries.

43:18.266 --> 43:18.707
Oh, yeah.

43:18.767 --> 43:29.162
Well, it's only mindful in the sense that it feels necessary to me, and I think it's connected to, you know, what I was talking about earlier about my having a problem with figuring out how to make something long.

43:30.256 --> 43:38.684
It just seems to me that if you put a kind of question at the center of things that you can get some mileage out of it.

43:39.705 --> 43:42.727
It's the kind of thing that you can keep coming back to again and again.

43:42.767 --> 43:44.229
There's something to unravel.

43:44.249 --> 43:53.577
There's something to figure out and to, you know, explore.

43:57.041 --> 43:59.723
And so, I mean, you can explore...

44:00.614 --> 44:29.541
other kinds of mysteries and I think my books do that but just in terms of the plot it helps me to have a sort of a mystery tied to the plot in some way to hang the exploration of other mysteries on it's the thing that far deeper mysteries I think yeah far deeper mysteries in the sense of like you know human mysteries or the mysteries about human character or

44:29.723 --> 44:46.762
the psychological issues that are in the books and that sort of thing, that we can tolerate and even enjoy those kinds of explorations if there's this other thing that's carrying us forward in a narrative way.

44:47.923 --> 44:56.753
Otherwise, you're reading a book that is a sort of prolonged exploration of human mystery.

44:57.815 --> 44:58.195
And...

44:58.630 --> 45:09.980
I think maybe better writers than me can do that and bring it off, but I seem to need to have this other thing to hang things on, just to carry me forward in a narrative sense.

45:10.221 --> 45:17.788
Okay, now what happens is a question that I have to ask myself at the end of each chapter in order to write the next chapter.

45:17.848 --> 45:23.112
So you don't have this thing figured out when you start writing?

45:23.132 --> 45:28.097
No, I don't, although it's clear to me that I need to know a certain amount of stuff

45:28.583 --> 45:31.610
before I'm able to even begin.

45:31.630 --> 45:34.195
How well do you know the characters personally?

45:34.596 --> 45:36.601
I don't think I know the characters very well.

45:37.102 --> 45:41.411
And that to me is what is the most exploring that I do.

45:41.432 --> 45:43.015
I kind of know them

45:43.552 --> 45:47.679
in a kind of general sense, you know, the sort of way that I might know you now.

45:47.839 --> 45:49.161
Even now?

45:49.782 --> 45:51.925
You don't know the characters any better even now?

45:52.146 --> 45:53.408
Oh, you mean after writing?

45:53.608 --> 45:55.591
Oh, no, after writing I know them very well.

45:55.611 --> 45:58.977
I mean, I've just spent two years with them, you know.

45:59.037 --> 45:59.658
Let me ask you this.

45:59.678 --> 46:02.022
Do you know more about them than the reader does?

46:03.424 --> 46:05.948
Can you tell me things about them that the reader doesn't know?

46:07.700 --> 46:14.009
I can certainly tell you things about them that I didn't explicitly put on the page, so in that sense there's more.

46:14.069 --> 46:16.833
Do you understand what I'm going with of the question?

46:16.853 --> 46:18.075
Maybe not.

46:18.095 --> 46:26.227
Their biography, any specific things about them that helps you understand things that you have to know, but the reader doesn't necessarily.

46:26.247 --> 46:28.891
Yeah, I think that there's certainly a lot of stuff like that.

46:28.931 --> 46:30.994
Isn't that what they call in drama backstory?

46:31.374 --> 46:31.935
I guess.

46:31.966 --> 46:35.390
I think sometimes it's called subtext, sometimes it's called backstory.

46:35.730 --> 46:41.858
It's the stuff that the actor who's playing the role knows about the character that really isn't in the play.

46:41.918 --> 46:42.959
Yeah, right, exactly.

46:43.640 --> 46:43.900
Yes.

46:44.281 --> 46:48.566
Doctorow discussed this with me, and he said, you know, things, he said, there are things I have to know.

46:48.586 --> 46:48.846
Right.

46:48.866 --> 46:50.028
So it's clear to me.

46:50.048 --> 46:50.248
Yes.

46:50.368 --> 46:52.631
Things that I don't have to bother the reader with.

46:52.651 --> 46:53.231
Right.

46:53.251 --> 46:57.497
But for me to explain why the character, I have to understand.

46:57.997 --> 47:00.740
You know, maybe there are incidents in this character's childhood.

47:01.081 --> 47:01.281
Right.

47:01.514 --> 47:12.852
that maybe happened that didn't find its way into the novel, but nevertheless, I'm just wondering if there are any kinds of things that, I mean, these characters, you say you don't know them that well when you're starting.

47:14.314 --> 47:15.916
Are they real to you nonetheless?

47:16.858 --> 47:18.040
They become real to me.

47:18.701 --> 47:29.918
In fact, you know, there's this wonderful, again, I said before, I think that it's one of the things that I have enjoyed most about writing novels is spending that much time with the characters

47:30.252 --> 47:45.796
and getting to know them better, see them come to life, see them become who they are, because I don't know, you know, I don't like figure them out completely before I start writing and then just kind of like put it down on the page.

47:46.898 --> 47:50.002
As I'm writing, they're emerging for me.

47:50.082 --> 47:52.867
Who they are is emerging for me.

47:52.927 --> 47:57.514
And it's fun to see how that takes place.

47:57.834 --> 47:58.335
I mean,

47:58.653 --> 48:03.599
I think somewhere I wrote a little bit about this in maybe a talk that I gave or something about.

48:04.680 --> 48:12.870
At some point, I'm aware of needing to become their... What would be the word?

48:18.196 --> 48:20.118
Being sort of honest with them.

48:20.319 --> 48:24.103
In other words... Well, not confessor, but...

48:24.995 --> 48:34.849
It's almost a parental role in the sense of, like, you know, as parents, one of the things that we try to do is to allow our children to become who they truly are.

48:34.869 --> 48:35.790
Mentor, perhaps?

48:36.191 --> 48:39.415
Well, not mentor, more like sort of... Guide?

48:40.917 --> 48:48.708
Well, encourager, loving them, you know, lover, and that says lover is the wrong connotation.

48:48.928 --> 48:51.492
But, you know...

48:51.792 --> 48:56.238
It's almost like being, to borrow a religious word, it's almost like being a steward.

48:57.159 --> 49:03.267
You know, allowing them to be who they are without laying... Without dictating who they should be.

49:03.287 --> 49:07.413
Dictating who they are or making them feel bad about who they are.

49:07.453 --> 49:11.398
I mean, that's the kind of things that we try to do with kids as parents.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.902
I mean, are you always happy with the way they turn out?

49:15.404 --> 49:16.105
The characters?

49:16.165 --> 49:16.726
Yeah.

49:16.746 --> 49:18.208
Oh, no, I don't believe I am.

49:18.588 --> 49:20.010
Because, I mean, Cook could have some...

49:20.716 --> 49:23.159
Cook became really difficult for me.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.801
He's a pain in the ass.

49:24.821 --> 49:26.984
I was going to say, he's not the nicest person I've ever met.

49:27.004 --> 49:28.326
He's not the nicest person.

49:28.466 --> 49:33.072
Boy, does he go on, you know, with his sort of self-obsession and, you know.

49:33.913 --> 49:49.913
And my challenge, my technical challenge with that character was to keep him interesting, you know, to make the way that he said things compelling enough, amusing enough

49:50.213 --> 49:57.183
witty enough that a writer was willing to go on listening to him.

49:57.563 --> 50:00.748
Not just a writer, but you have to think of me, too, the reader, don't you?

50:00.908 --> 50:01.969
I meant to say reader.

50:02.270 --> 50:04.513
I said writer, but I meant reader.

50:04.613 --> 50:07.337
But the reader was willing to go on listening to him.

50:08.558 --> 50:16.930
So I had to try to make his voice witty enough, amusing enough, engaging enough at turns.

50:17.230 --> 50:22.976
that we'd listen to this stuff for however many pages it is.

50:23.516 --> 50:25.098
And I experienced that as a writer.

50:25.418 --> 50:29.382
Boy, I was glad to be done with him when I was done with him, because I'd just had enough.

50:29.563 --> 50:31.865
I'd listened to him long enough.

50:31.885 --> 50:38.071
Did it ever occur to you that maybe he was going on the wrong track and that he needed some behavior modification?

50:38.872 --> 50:40.153
Well, I think that's who he is.

50:40.173 --> 50:41.335
I mean, to me, that's who he is.

50:41.395 --> 50:43.317
He's a person who is on the wrong track.

50:43.537 --> 50:43.677
Uh-huh.

50:44.146 --> 50:48.631
That's one of the essences of the novel, isn't it?

50:48.651 --> 50:56.561
Well, yeah, and I think that comes back to what I said earlier about, you know, there'll be people who, when they read this book, they'll get it, and there'll be people who, when they read it, they don't get it.

50:56.581 --> 51:01.286
And I think for the people who don't get it, they may be put off by it.

51:03.028 --> 51:11.098
Because my notion here was that I took a fellow who was not entirely on the wrong track,

51:11.264 --> 51:12.886
Because I think he's redeemable.

51:12.906 --> 51:14.528
No, but he is a pain in the ass.

51:14.588 --> 51:15.669
He's a pain in the ass.

51:15.749 --> 51:18.132
He's self-centered.

51:18.252 --> 51:20.434
I'd like to give him a shot in the ass, too.

51:20.454 --> 51:22.457
I'd like to give him a shot in the ass.

51:22.477 --> 51:22.597
Yeah.

51:22.617 --> 51:23.157
But anyway, go ahead.

51:23.177 --> 51:23.578
I'm sorry.

51:23.958 --> 51:24.379
Well, it's okay.

51:24.779 --> 51:31.266
And he... So what the story does is it takes him and explores his character.

51:31.306 --> 51:36.392
It reveals his character with all its sort of off-putting qualities.

51:37.974 --> 51:39.676
It's still turning, right?

51:39.716 --> 51:40.697
It stops turning your left.

51:41.302 --> 51:41.863
It's turning.

51:43.024 --> 51:43.885
It's about an hour.

51:44.185 --> 51:55.277
And when the book ends, he's just at the threshold of kind of like having gotten hit on the head hard enough that he's beginning to come to his senses.

51:55.998 --> 52:08.592
And it's my intention that when the book ends, we see clearly that a change is certain, you know, that he really does get it now that he has to change himself in some way.

52:09.078 --> 52:19.092
When you say he gets it, is that also what you want your reader... I mean, do you care to articulate what the reader... If the reader is getting it, do you care to articulate what you feel the reader should be getting?

52:20.134 --> 52:24.821
I don't mind articulating what I think the reader should be getting, but I also like to think that it's in the book already.

52:25.281 --> 52:36.317
I mean, the sort of whole last chapter of the book, it seems to me, is an effort to put that forward in his...

52:36.584 --> 52:41.152
everything that he says quite near the end of what he has to say.

52:41.172 --> 52:43.295
I'm not talking about the epilogue so much.

52:43.335 --> 52:46.921
I don't give things away, by the way.

52:47.102 --> 52:48.704
Yeah, okay.

52:48.744 --> 52:56.938
Well, what he says near the end of the book is that, I mean, I see him as a man who's going to be embarking on some kind of genuine spiritual journey.

52:57.509 --> 53:02.814
when the book ends, and that's really what's been missing in his life up to that point.

53:02.834 --> 53:15.967
I mean, he's had these problems that he's somehow been able to put down, but he hasn't really replaced it, you know, with what would, you know, fill it up.

53:16.988 --> 53:25.356
So that's why he's still so vulnerable to getting caught up in something that takes him out of his life and takes him out of his

53:25.893 --> 53:31.698
you know, world, and, you know, and he's so taken with these sort of supernatural experiences.

53:31.738 --> 53:45.050
I just see them as kind of the supernatural experiences, as being like drugs, like alcohol, you know, like any of the other things that people do to take themselves out of themselves.

53:46.871 --> 53:49.653
You know, the supernatural experiences are like that.

53:50.214 --> 53:53.897
I'm going to turn the tape.

53:53.917 --> 53:54.057
Okay.

53:54.097 --> 53:54.938
You know, and there's something
