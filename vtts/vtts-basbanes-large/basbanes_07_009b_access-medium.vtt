WEBVTT

00:03.828 --> 00:04.629
Okay.

00:04.649 --> 00:21.035
Well, let me just count that statement by saying that don't forget that there are any number of collectors over the past who have had merchandise delivered to them by booksellers and not asked the bookseller into the house.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.078
Yeah, but everybody wanted to see who this guy was.

00:23.218 --> 00:26.624
Everybody wanted to, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he has to comply.

00:26.644 --> 00:30.730
But he was just delivering the first portfolio of Shakespeare and he had just come up from New York.

00:30.710 --> 00:31.773
I know.

00:31.873 --> 00:37.286
And it's not an unreasonable request to want to go and use the mention.

00:37.467 --> 00:39.592
No, I'm saying that's unreasonable.

00:39.612 --> 00:44.644
I'm saying that behavior is unreasonable, but it is not unknown.

00:44.905 --> 00:47.892
And I have known collectors in England.

00:48.192 --> 00:58.750
who would just take delivery of a valuable book at the door, and you were expected not to come in.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.413
And that was that.

01:01.534 --> 01:09.488
There's a certain area here of tradesmen and gentlemen.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.631
You may not understand that.

01:12.052 --> 01:13.795
On the other hand, let me interject.

01:14.062 --> 01:23.215
Haven actively sought out the company of other collectors, of booksellers, book people such as yourself.

01:23.235 --> 01:32.508
We actively sought their company and sought ways to be invited to their homes and then used John Fleming to get invitations.

01:34.050 --> 01:38.597
I'm sure getting to your house that night was kind of a cool thing.

01:38.617 --> 01:39.878
No, I shouldn't think so.

01:39.899 --> 01:40.980
No, not the slightest thing.

01:41.365 --> 01:43.730
Just a minor, very much a minor figure.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.694
No, he associated with booksellers.

01:46.055 --> 01:48.921
I don't think he associated with collectors until later on.

01:49.802 --> 01:53.330
I think he may have, I don't know, when the episode of Shidey took place.

01:53.670 --> 01:53.991
Late.

01:54.275 --> 02:01.003
Blake, yeah, well he also, if you remember, he got involved with the Blake things.

02:01.023 --> 02:03.827
Nicholas Bartle will fill you in on the works.

02:03.847 --> 02:09.113
Geoffrey Caines and this and that, sure.

02:09.193 --> 02:13.238
Anyway, it was a great, great film.

02:13.278 --> 02:20.367
And if he'd gone on for 30 odd years, it would have been an immeasurably greater film.

02:20.587 --> 02:21.328
Did you know...

02:21.511 --> 02:25.897
Did you ever have any dealings with Michael Davis's father, Leonard Davis?

02:26.238 --> 02:26.578
Not at all, no.

02:26.598 --> 02:27.800
Do you know who Leonard Davis is?

02:27.820 --> 02:28.060
No.

02:28.621 --> 02:33.528
I heard of Michael Davis only at the time when we did the appraisal.

02:33.909 --> 02:44.224
And I think I must have seen Michael Davis's name on an invoice delivered to Michael Davis.

02:44.304 --> 02:46.066
I think it was an H.P.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.248
Crown invoice.

02:47.600 --> 02:55.511
And I heard, I heard of Michael Davis from Thorne Weldon, who worked for John Fleming.

02:55.531 --> 02:57.253
He now works at Journal Street.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.996
I know, yeah.

02:59.276 --> 03:00.097
You've had lunch with him.

03:00.117 --> 03:08.629
Good, because I heard from Thorne, I mean, quite innocent.

03:09.048 --> 03:11.912
Thorne's not a child, she's a woman.

03:12.332 --> 03:16.017
And Thorne said, my God, yeah, we all remembered Michael Davis.

03:16.117 --> 03:17.159
His nickname was Fox.

03:17.419 --> 03:19.462
Well, I don't know.

03:20.163 --> 03:26.592
She said we used to party with Michael here in New York in 1974 and five.

03:27.873 --> 03:28.474
Why not?

03:28.657 --> 03:34.242
She was, however old she would have been then, she would have been 19 or 20, I suppose.

03:35.283 --> 03:35.623
So fine.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.986
It's an amazing story, isn't it?

03:39.006 --> 03:41.048
It's an amazing story.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.970
Well, you know more about that than I do.

03:43.330 --> 03:44.731
What's the outcome of the suit?

03:44.751 --> 03:47.994
What's the outcome of the suit?

03:48.014 --> 03:51.397
Did you know that his name is probably 19 or more?

03:51.838 --> 03:54.320
Well, yes, I knew that, but I didn't know what the name was.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.202
Do you know now?

03:56.522 --> 03:56.622
Nope.

03:56.642 --> 03:57.803
I didn't have an idea.

03:58.508 --> 04:01.553
No, not from memory, I don't.

04:01.653 --> 04:05.560
How did you know that it wasn't his name?

04:07.704 --> 04:10.809
I think it was mentioned by Arthur Houghton to me.

04:10.829 --> 04:15.998
No, he didn't know the name, but there were just a number of people.

04:16.078 --> 04:17.040
Yeah, that's right.

04:17.695 --> 04:18.336
That's right.

04:18.356 --> 04:20.478
That's the title of that chapter, by the way.

04:21.619 --> 04:22.340
Have No More.

04:23.841 --> 04:24.482
No, sure.

04:24.522 --> 04:24.982
Have No More.

04:25.022 --> 04:25.923
So what was his name?

04:26.123 --> 04:27.765
I haven't worked with him.

04:27.785 --> 04:29.607
Oh, you still don't know him?

04:29.647 --> 04:30.648
Shackley Product.

04:30.668 --> 04:31.569
Shackley Product.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.111
This is years ago.

04:33.171 --> 04:40.518
Speculation of various sorts about background of his money.

04:40.958 --> 04:46.504
One of the things he told me was that it developed...

04:46.906 --> 04:53.057
a guidance system for Polaris missiles and sold it to the government.

04:53.077 --> 04:59.709
And that had us wreathed in smiles for a number of months.

04:59.729 --> 05:01.011
Shaq and Fredericks?

05:01.032 --> 05:02.434
Shaq, he told you that name?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.614
No, I think somebody, I think I heard it around here.

05:05.634 --> 05:06.255
I'll check it out.

05:06.495 --> 05:08.238
You can, sure.

05:08.498 --> 05:10.441
And then I heard that his wife had money.

05:11.182 --> 05:12.023
She's from Arkansas.

05:12.103 --> 05:12.945
Harris from Arkansas.

05:12.965 --> 05:16.670
Yeah, well, I heard on the grapevine that she had money.

05:16.690 --> 05:20.576
None of these things meant anything when we heard about Michael Davis.

05:20.596 --> 05:25.923
As soon as we heard about Michael Davis, we then said, ah, that's the source of his money.

05:26.164 --> 05:26.764
That's fine.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.248
One other quick thing.

05:29.515 --> 05:34.924
Did he tell you where he went to school?

05:34.944 --> 05:35.204
No.

05:35.224 --> 05:41.394
On the 1980s and the 1990s, was the 1980s a new golden age in bookselling and book collecting?

05:41.434 --> 05:51.731
As David Redden has asserted, and as Ed Wolff said, he said, well, I didn't see any picklet papers, not picklet papers, Paul Richard Alman, actually.

05:52.372 --> 05:53.434
You know, a golden age.

05:53.514 --> 05:56.198
He said, we'd love to have a complete set of books.

05:56.600 --> 06:05.429
I guess what he's saying is that there's some wonderful things available, but you still couldn't, by the way, Huntington was able to buy 70, 80 years ago.

06:06.470 --> 06:12.776
But nevertheless, there were some marvelous things because of the changes in the tax laws and the institutions.

06:12.796 --> 06:14.338
Not getting the material that they want.

06:14.578 --> 06:17.941
That's a very dry, unfocused state.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.865
But maybe if you could just give me a comment on the 80s and what you see in the 90s.

06:21.885 --> 06:23.687
How's that?

06:23.903 --> 06:42.300
My view of the thought of high prices and big time auctions really starts in November 1985.

06:42.360 --> 06:50.788
It's the first time we had a general miscellaneous consigned sale.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.741
from various owners that was 100% sold across the board.

06:54.781 --> 07:06.455
There seemed at that time to be a situation where everything just sold at Auckland.

07:06.475 --> 07:08.357
Everything sold and for very high prices.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.440
There had been great sales with us before.

07:13.243 --> 07:15.325
Some of our greatest sales, namely

07:16.098 --> 07:28.690
the Chew Sale in 1982, in which we had the original manuscript of the Mason-Dixon line, and the Declaration of Independence, and the Charter for Pennsylvania.

07:30.256 --> 07:32.078
A sale like that made $800,000.

07:32.258 --> 07:39.105
A sale like that today would bring $5 million.

07:39.125 --> 07:39.686
Even today?

07:40.106 --> 07:43.490
I'm saying today, from 82 to 91, it would bring $5 million.

07:43.530 --> 07:57.705
Today, well, assuming that a copy of the Declaration of Independence belonging to Justice Chew with an impeccable provenance, it's got to bring as much as the last one, mate, I would have thought.

07:57.725 --> 07:59.166
Which nobody knows what to know.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.232
Any theories on that?

08:03.394 --> 08:04.996
Do you think it was found in a free market?

08:05.737 --> 08:06.899
No, I don't know.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.721
You want me to guess?

08:08.781 --> 08:09.642
No, I don't think so.

08:10.283 --> 08:12.205
I think it came out of an archive.

08:12.245 --> 08:15.569
Most of them come out of archives.

08:16.310 --> 08:21.717
The Corn Leary copy emerged in a bookstore, which is possible.

08:21.837 --> 08:29.406
The Corn Leary copy that was sold in 1969, it was at Leary's bookstore in Philadelphia for many, many years.

08:29.791 --> 08:32.033
before being sold in 1969.

08:33.895 --> 08:41.462
The copy that we sold for the Chew family was discovered in the archive in 1972.

08:41.542 --> 08:46.046
The copy in the Chew family archive.

08:46.407 --> 08:59.359
The copy we sold for the Wood family in North Carolina from Edenton was discovered in a family archive in about 1981.

08:59.457 --> 09:07.164
and it was shown to Freddie Goff, he showed it to me, and we sold it a year after the two, the two copy.

09:07.184 --> 09:22.039
But what I'm saying is that... Tuck, tuck, tuck behind a picture frame, and you can't find the picture frame, and the picture's gone, and then it's taken two years to sell it from the sale.

09:22.059 --> 09:24.822
And the owner, we don't know who the owner is either, the consignor.

09:24.962 --> 09:25.262
No.

09:26.137 --> 09:28.542
The whole thing is strange.

09:28.562 --> 09:30.988
And yet it's a heck of a beautiful coffee.

09:31.008 --> 09:36.400
Well, there's nothing wrong with it being a beautiful coffee, but they often are beautiful.

09:36.600 --> 09:42.393
The Chew coffee and the wood coffee that we sold were equally beautiful.

09:42.934 --> 09:45.580
The magnificent coffees, you can just see pictures of them in a

09:45.863 --> 09:46.965
in the catalogs.

09:46.985 --> 09:48.347
I mean, they were brilliant copies.

09:48.367 --> 09:49.729
They were quite as good as that one.

09:49.749 --> 09:55.257
When you say an archive, you think a private archive or an institutional archive that hasn't been catalogued?

09:55.277 --> 09:57.901
I haven't any idea.

09:57.921 --> 09:59.363
I have no idea.

09:59.383 --> 10:01.487
I mean, now let's talk briefly about texts.

10:01.507 --> 10:02.408
I guess we'd have to go.

10:03.329 --> 10:04.571
Did you know Luke Feldman at all?

10:05.072 --> 10:05.513
Very well.

10:06.394 --> 10:06.815
Very well.

10:07.416 --> 10:11.682
Can you give me a couple of quick insights on Luke and David Feldman?

10:11.702 --> 10:15.027
Well, no, I remember him from when I was a kid, from when I was 18, and

10:15.293 --> 10:20.239
We're travelling to London each year with his wife, Big Astrakhan Colin Coat.

10:20.259 --> 10:23.923
I remember him buying the Chaucer at Christie's sale in 1974.

10:25.284 --> 10:30.610
I remember I wasn't there because Bart was sent over for the sale, I think.

10:30.630 --> 10:38.379
But just after I left London, we had a sale of the Library of Siegfried Sassoon.

10:38.399 --> 10:43.765
And apart from one smallish sale in 19...

10:44.555 --> 10:55.913
68 or 67 in London, which was a sale of pamphlets of Swift, where Traylon bought something like 80% of the sale.

10:57.916 --> 11:02.083
I mean, that's like batting 400, you know what I mean?

11:02.103 --> 11:07.111
At the Secret Sassoon sale, I think Felton bought 85% of the sale for stock.

11:07.491 --> 11:08.813
Bartle... For stock?

11:09.094 --> 11:09.514
For stock.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.237
He'll clarify that number, yeah.

11:11.538 --> 11:33.310
did you think that this was being brought actually for texas well it had texas in mind but i think he was buying it for stuff and and that's that's something to do with i mean at the first chance for sale that we had in 1958 fleming would have bought something like 40 percent and he was by far and away

11:33.897 --> 11:35.238
The biggest buyer.

11:36.419 --> 11:38.321
Any insight as to why Texas Letters?

11:39.642 --> 11:42.005
Hicks told them to be their exclusive agent.

11:43.646 --> 11:45.208
Why nobody else had a shot selling?

11:45.268 --> 11:47.650
No, I've no idea.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.791
No, I've no idea.

11:48.811 --> 11:52.995
But I mean, that was pretty much understood that he was acting almost exclusively.

11:53.315 --> 11:56.718
Well, because he had a good relationship with Ransom, I would have thought.

11:56.798 --> 11:59.181
I mean, you mean, do I know any of the scufflepots?

11:59.221 --> 12:00.382
No, I don't, is the answer.

12:00.402 --> 12:02.824
No, I don't know any of the scufflepots.

12:03.007 --> 12:23.411
any more than, I mean, one knows that among these dealers, in the old days, a dealer would have a cast-iron relationship with certain collectors or librarians.

12:24.292 --> 12:29.098
My father, who died in 1980, and Ted Green of Quaritch, who died about three years ago,

12:29.585 --> 12:39.394
They were rather remarkable in post-war London because they were the two heads of firms who did the most unusual thing of having lunch together once in a while.

12:39.414 --> 12:40.836
You never used to do that.

12:42.537 --> 12:45.660
You never used to have this kind of closeness.

12:45.680 --> 12:53.588
And now, of course, everybody's sharing everything because nobody can afford it anyway to buy it for themselves in a picture sale.

12:54.388 --> 12:59.473
I mean, this is kind of small fly stuff in the book market, but can you imagine...

13:00.112 --> 13:27.402
going to a general picture sale at Sotheby's in 1989 and the general picture sale was 200 million dollars and you have all those people in the audience and they're buying and some of them are buying for stock or rather they're buying to sell on so therefore you put your hand up and you buy a painting for five million well

13:28.462 --> 13:52.647
if i put my hand up as a dealer and bought it for five million i might have three people who's sharing that with me because i can't possibly buy the check for five million on my own then when the time comes through if i was a collector if the time comes to me to resell manny's got a point you can't duplicate those ideas because

13:53.167 --> 13:57.292
I'd like to stick my hand up again and say five million for that payment.

13:57.312 --> 14:01.398
But the other five guys, they're not going to lend me the money anymore, you see.

14:01.458 --> 14:09.528
So you're still dealing with books in an area that's kind of containable.

14:10.169 --> 14:11.711
It's containable in the sums of money.

14:12.172 --> 14:13.774
It's in a reality.

14:14.294 --> 14:22.885
You know very well that your $1,500 purchase is something that you consider very carefully, but it's still a containable number.

14:23.966 --> 14:30.955
It's, I don't know, it's an eighth of a Honda Civic with everything on it.

14:32.337 --> 14:33.859
What do you think about the Manny sale?

14:33.879 --> 14:38.044
You thought the Guardian sale was a really great collection of books.

14:38.064 --> 14:40.207
What do you know of the Manny sale?

14:40.227 --> 14:41.128
How do you judge that?

14:41.716 --> 14:45.702
How do I judge it by comparison with the garden?

14:45.722 --> 14:54.594
Well, as a collection of books that's coming up for sale, I mean, it's certainly going to be in the top ten in terms of grossing, wouldn't you think?

14:54.834 --> 14:55.716
Top ten of what?

14:55.956 --> 15:00.582
Of book sales.

15:00.603 --> 15:01.143
I don't know.

15:01.464 --> 15:02.866
I don't know what the estimate on it is.

15:02.946 --> 15:07.072
All I can tell you about it is that it's... Well, if you go over ten million, you're in the top ten easily.

15:07.092 --> 15:08.353
Is it a ten million dollar sale?

15:08.674 --> 15:09.155
I don't know.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.638
Nobody knows.

15:11.939 --> 15:13.500
They've got estimates.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.542
The Shakespeare's alone are two million, right?

15:15.562 --> 15:17.404
You have to put two million on the Shakespeare's.

15:17.524 --> 15:19.846
Why do you have to put two million on the Shakespeare's?

15:19.886 --> 15:22.768
Because that was the price two years ago.

15:23.349 --> 15:25.351
Well, why do you have to put two million on it now, then?

15:25.671 --> 15:27.693
What would you put on it?

15:27.713 --> 15:31.176
I don't know, but I wouldn't have put a million on it in the first place.

15:31.396 --> 15:31.716
I didn't.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.098
There was a million on it.

15:34.719 --> 15:34.959
I know.

15:35.019 --> 15:38.963
I said I wouldn't have put a million on it in the first place, and I didn't.

15:38.983 --> 15:39.743
Interesting.

15:39.823 --> 15:40.304
It's nice.

15:40.364 --> 15:41.245
It's straightforward.

15:41.345 --> 15:41.625
I mean,

15:42.263 --> 15:45.913
If you bought a Rolls-Royce in 1989, how much would you sell it for now?

15:49.643 --> 15:56.762
Well, but automobiles don't appreciate the way... No, that's right.

15:57.535 --> 16:01.260
So are you trying to make me into Mr. Manny or what?

16:01.540 --> 16:02.581
No, no, no, no.

16:02.601 --> 16:06.527
Well, if you had Van Gogh's irises to sell now, how much would it make?

16:06.907 --> 16:08.509
Not 200 million or 100 million.

16:08.529 --> 16:10.211
Well, no, it would hardly make that.

16:10.231 --> 16:12.494
It made 50 million on money.

16:12.614 --> 16:16.279
I was thinking of those other two that went for 150 million.

16:16.459 --> 16:22.707
It made 50 million with Sotheby's lending money on it in 1988.

16:23.288 --> 16:24.910
So how much would it make now?

16:25.717 --> 16:27.740
That's all I'm saying.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.398
So, you know.
