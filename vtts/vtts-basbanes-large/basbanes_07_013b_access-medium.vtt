WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:08.792
I have about 200 American imprints in 1701.

00:09.493 --> 00:19.185
And of that, maybe 150 or 160 or, you know, discrete items, some complete, some what have you, damaged, some fragmented.

00:19.205 --> 00:29.218
Of that quantity, I have maybe five or six that are printed in New York, one printed in Philadelphia, and the rest printed in Massachusetts.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.180
They just don't exist.

00:31.881 --> 00:32.822
They're established.

00:33.747 --> 00:38.392
And you just frame these things, and then who ascertains that they are unique?

00:38.452 --> 00:40.033
You or the dealers?

00:40.093 --> 00:41.755
The things that I find that are unique?

00:42.836 --> 00:47.440
No, the dealers, sometimes they know, or sometimes they know exactly what they are.

00:48.081 --> 00:51.444
Sometimes they don't extrapolate the importance of what they say.

00:51.464 --> 00:55.368
Do you think they offer them to somebody like Michael Koresson before they offer them to you?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.290
Most of the time, but sometimes they don't.

00:59.752 --> 01:02.795
In this particular case, here's something that sort of slipped through.

01:02.815 --> 01:03.636
I think this is the one.

01:04.274 --> 01:08.701
Let's see.

01:08.721 --> 01:12.246
It's in fair shape, but I'm not mistaken.

01:16.914 --> 01:17.795
This is a copy.

01:17.855 --> 01:22.142
This was the accession from Ayr, which is, I guess, Chicago.

01:24.005 --> 01:25.347
Newberry Library.

01:25.367 --> 01:26.188
Newberry?

01:26.348 --> 01:28.331
Yeah, this is a duplicate.

01:28.371 --> 01:32.037
These are the duplicates of the Massachusetts laws of 1699.

01:32.995 --> 01:53.953
Now, the interesting thing about it, what they did not realize, and I believe this is correct, is that let me see if this is the one.

01:53.973 --> 01:56.295
Yeah, this is it.

01:56.736 --> 02:02.901
When they deaccessioned it, they didn't know that the coats of arms that were used

02:03.370 --> 02:08.095
were for Anne and not for George III or William III.

02:09.997 --> 02:10.637
William III.

02:11.318 --> 02:17.044
So that they did not realize it was a variant.

02:17.064 --> 02:21.629
I didn't realize it until I started looking at it and found out that it wasn't WR.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.810
It was AR.

02:22.890 --> 02:23.871
What is it?

02:23.891 --> 02:24.932
It says AR.

02:25.032 --> 02:25.793
It says AR.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.194
Page 193.

02:27.575 --> 02:28.075
OK.

02:29.096 --> 02:32.820
These were the acts and laws for the session.

02:33.290 --> 02:38.035
Okay, at the general court, it was held May 29, 1700.

02:38.295 --> 02:45.483
And this coat of arms was with the initial for Queen Anne.

02:47.926 --> 02:50.068
And on the right is?

02:50.429 --> 02:57.897
No, Anne Regina, as opposed to William Regis Rex or what have you.

03:01.555 --> 03:05.840
One of these is... Well, do you think there's any kind of difference in the text?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.522
No, the text is all the same.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.406
They just pulled that slug out and put another one in.

03:10.826 --> 03:22.660
But from a collecting point of view, or a collector's point of view, it turns out this is the only known copy of that law with that plate.

03:23.821 --> 03:29.368
And it is known only by inference other than that.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.951
Who came first, this Monarch or the other one?

03:32.231 --> 03:33.713
Oh, the other one.

03:33.733 --> 03:34.213
He died.

03:34.934 --> 03:37.036
There's another thing, talk about American book plates.

03:37.376 --> 03:38.477
There's a wonderful book plate.

03:38.497 --> 03:41.940
Samuel Phillips, his book, 1707.

03:42.521 --> 03:43.842
And he did that when he was at Harvard.

03:45.543 --> 03:48.466
This is a book of Harvard.

03:48.486 --> 03:52.550
Now, I have, it's a nice, but it's not an American book.

03:52.590 --> 03:53.891
I have it only for the book plate.

03:53.931 --> 03:58.495
Now, as a passing, where the hell is it like?

03:59.993 --> 04:14.496
This came out of a library someplace, right?

04:14.516 --> 04:14.817
What?

04:14.937 --> 04:16.039
You know what with the numbers on it?

04:16.199 --> 04:18.082
I would guess a lot of these came out of libraries.

04:19.224 --> 04:20.626
Nothing wrong with that?

04:20.646 --> 04:23.931
No, no, no, no, I'm just saying it's on the line.

04:23.951 --> 04:26.355
Okay, so if you know what, here's something to show you here next time.

04:28.597 --> 04:30.682
This is one of the wonderful things.

04:31.504 --> 04:41.746
There are probably about 25 or so known book plates, American book plates, before 1701.

04:41.947 --> 04:44.432
I mean, that's the universe.

04:46.778 --> 04:47.820
All right?

04:48.256 --> 04:50.219
This is a woman who had her book plate.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.123
And I have this, I have two examples of it.

04:53.263 --> 04:55.266
I think there are maybe four of them known.

04:55.286 --> 04:55.907
That is 1701.

04:56.808 --> 04:57.389
No, it isn't.

04:57.469 --> 05:00.113
It's 1701, but I have another one of hers dated 1692.

05:00.273 --> 05:04.299
So her book plate... Hannah Sutton.

05:04.319 --> 05:09.246
Hannah Sutton had a book plate at least in 1692, because I have one where she dated it.

05:11.369 --> 05:14.854
And I'm certain it's the only woman who ever had a book plate in colonial America.

05:15.222 --> 05:16.504
Where is she from?

05:16.744 --> 05:17.385
Boston.

05:17.405 --> 05:18.546
Did she try to check her out?

05:18.566 --> 05:19.407
I tried to check her out.

05:19.568 --> 05:20.909
Extraordinary.

05:20.929 --> 05:25.295
AAS and the Metropolitan Museum have a copy.

05:25.635 --> 05:36.029
She is supposedly known as the wife of some guy, but the point is that I have two of hers, and I have an unrecorded one from a New Jersey collector.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.613
Book plates before 1700?

05:39.734 --> 05:40.975
Book plates before 1700.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.238
You talk about

05:45.783 --> 05:59.105
And then there is another genre, which I can't show you because, come on, I'll show you some other stuff.

05:59.686 --> 06:08.520
There's another little visual area of collecting, which is books written in Dutch and printed in America.

06:09.422 --> 06:12.567
And in that world, there's a universe of

06:13.340 --> 06:19.066
The interesting thing, Dutch printing, the earliest Dutch printing was 1693.

06:21.048 --> 06:25.713
And the press died out in 1796 and started in 1830.

06:27.495 --> 06:39.308
So in the area of 17th century or early Evans items collected, there's a guy, Henrik Edelman, did a census of it.

06:39.328 --> 06:41.170
And there probably are...

06:42.787 --> 06:50.116
75 known different titles, of which the universe is 88.

06:50.637 --> 06:51.317
And I have one.

06:52.158 --> 06:56.284
Look at this, though.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.646
Let me show you something.

06:58.666 --> 06:59.367
This is all.

07:00.389 --> 07:01.190
That's wonderful.

07:01.210 --> 07:01.810
Look at this, though.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.973
Here's a set of Bibles, right?

07:05.635 --> 07:06.536
I want you to see this.

07:08.058 --> 07:09.279
This was done around 8, 10, 30.

07:09.299 --> 07:10.861
Look at the condition of this book.

07:10.921 --> 07:12.203
There's 48 of these things, all right?

07:13.921 --> 07:17.506
Jesus.

07:20.991 --> 07:26.078
This here is one of the truly amazing things.

07:26.398 --> 07:28.161
This is a set bound in vellum.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.484
You never see vellum in America.

07:30.524 --> 07:31.606
Never.

07:31.746 --> 07:33.969
I was just about to say it's in vellum.

07:33.989 --> 07:35.751
You never see American vellum bindings.

07:35.851 --> 07:37.814
Okay, this is just a nice step.

07:37.834 --> 07:38.956
These are late.

07:39.517 --> 07:41.039
This is spectacular, this book.

07:42.741 --> 07:43.422
That binding.

07:43.823 --> 07:45.245
That's 1790-odd.

07:45.725 --> 07:49.009
I have a few 18th century bindings here.

07:49.029 --> 07:50.010
Those are still engravings, right?

07:50.070 --> 07:50.371
Yeah.

07:51.112 --> 07:54.536
But as far as bindings go, this book here, this is an interesting thing.

07:54.736 --> 07:55.336
Winterbottom.

07:55.397 --> 07:56.258
I think that's wonderful.

07:56.698 --> 07:57.960
That's a nice... Look at that.

07:58.060 --> 07:58.801
That's wonderful.

07:58.821 --> 08:00.823
But here's something that's even more interesting.

08:00.843 --> 08:01.303
I'll show you.

08:02.685 --> 08:08.532
That's the first colored plate in an American book.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.493
What's the name of the book?

08:09.845 --> 08:12.069
Winterbottom's History of America.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.733
Winterbottom is the author.

08:14.973 --> 08:15.735
What's his name?

08:15.755 --> 08:17.057
History of America.

08:17.077 --> 08:18.079
By Winterbottom.

08:18.099 --> 08:22.546
Yeah, it's English, it's a reprint, but that's the first time a hand colored plate was used.

08:22.646 --> 08:23.547
How do you spell Winterbottom?

08:24.589 --> 08:25.791
Winterbottom.

08:25.811 --> 08:27.414
Do you see it?

08:27.774 --> 08:28.415
Oh, there it is.

08:28.436 --> 08:31.481
W-I-N-T-E-I-B-O-T-H-A-M-W period Winterbottom.

08:31.641 --> 08:35.447
Now, the interesting thing is that not too many people know

08:35.950 --> 08:37.593
that in 17, what is it, 1796.

08:37.673 --> 08:40.799
Well, did it take them to get to volume three to get the first color plant?

08:40.819 --> 08:41.099
No, no, no.

08:41.119 --> 08:41.660
It's only one.

08:42.301 --> 08:44.846
I mean, there are a number of illustrations, but that's the only one colored.

08:44.866 --> 08:45.627
Oh, it's home colored.

08:45.647 --> 08:46.369
It has to be game colored.

08:46.389 --> 08:46.609
Yes.

08:47.470 --> 08:48.452
I'm saying that's the first.

08:48.893 --> 08:50.316
I wonder why they did it in volume three.

08:50.736 --> 08:52.960
They only wanted to illustrate the tobacco plant.

08:52.980 --> 08:53.782
I mean, they were all published.

08:53.802 --> 08:55.966
So that's got to be in the tobacco collection in New York, then.

08:56.226 --> 08:57.368
I would hope so.

08:57.388 --> 08:57.488
Yeah.

08:57.508 --> 08:57.969
At Aarons.

08:58.190 --> 08:58.310
Yeah.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.612
This is a set.

09:00.233 --> 09:00.814
in paper.

09:01.495 --> 09:03.778
Again, it's 1820.

09:04.780 --> 09:05.240
Look at this.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.724
It's all the string.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.668
Look at this type of bonding.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.032
This is nice.

09:13.052 --> 09:13.613
Do you like this?

09:13.913 --> 09:14.854
They're elegant.

09:14.874 --> 09:15.595
Here's something.

09:21.043 --> 09:23.447
Morse's American Gazetteer.

09:24.088 --> 09:26.431
G-A-G-E-T-E-R.

09:26.451 --> 09:29.616
I just made a mistake.

09:29.714 --> 09:30.235
No, I didn't.

09:30.255 --> 09:33.360
I didn't make a mistake.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.161
You missing something?

09:35.944 --> 09:36.165
No.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.150
Oh, look at this stuff, man.

09:39.991 --> 09:41.193
Look at this.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.637
One, two, three, four, one.

09:43.657 --> 09:44.018
Oh, God.

09:44.058 --> 09:44.739
That's exquisite.

09:44.839 --> 09:47.243
That is exquisite.

09:47.303 --> 09:49.888
You can't see unless you open it up.

09:49.968 --> 09:54.996
Let me show you some other.

09:58.503 --> 10:00.805
Well, is it the best of what you get, or is it better stuff at the house?

10:00.925 --> 10:02.147
Oh, no, no.

10:02.167 --> 10:07.592
This is all 19th century, and this is the best of what I got for 19th century.

10:07.612 --> 10:08.513
And this is pretty good.

10:09.494 --> 10:15.940
But I haven't gone through this and culled it, and I will cull it, and I will get rid of some things that are a little bit derivative.

10:16.581 --> 10:17.402
I may, I may not.

10:18.142 --> 10:18.963
Do you enjoy the life?

10:24.409 --> 10:25.530
It's the New York mirror.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.852
That happens to have gone through a lot of...

10:28.355 --> 10:30.359
This is beautiful stuff.

10:30.459 --> 10:31.601
This is really wonderful.

10:32.002 --> 10:43.122
The idea of... Here's something that's not American.

10:44.364 --> 10:47.910
You'll never see this again.

10:47.930 --> 10:48.351
Look at that.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.834
These are books.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.118
Imagine what they looked like when they were new.

10:52.368 --> 10:54.491
Not too much difference, just a little brighter.

10:54.511 --> 10:55.412
These are books.

10:55.432 --> 10:56.234
This is blue.

10:56.514 --> 10:57.556
You got those at a notch in it.

10:57.596 --> 10:58.297
No, I got them.

10:58.397 --> 11:00.460
No, this, as a matter of fact, wasn't an author.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.643
Oh, it's a lot, six, eight, each other.

11:02.663 --> 11:09.152
But these were done for the German immigrants to Pennsylvania.

11:09.292 --> 11:13.018
They're song books in German, but only for the American trade.

11:13.779 --> 11:21.430
And one of them has a Philadelphia printed for someone in Philadelphia sort of thing in it.

11:22.388 --> 11:23.629
That's beautiful.

11:23.649 --> 11:27.233
Here's one of the first books that has stamping on it.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.675
Stamping, guilt stamping on cloth.

11:28.815 --> 11:29.596
That's there, right?

11:29.616 --> 11:31.078
1830-ish.

11:31.098 --> 11:32.639
Just take a look.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.883
Hard to tell because 1831.

11:35.903 --> 11:36.404
Yeah, sure.

11:38.486 --> 11:44.693
Here is, you know, that's one type of binding.

11:44.713 --> 11:47.756
And then you get to this sort of, look at these stripes, these colors.

11:47.836 --> 11:48.497
That's gorgeous.

11:50.030 --> 11:51.692
You get these from all over, right?

11:51.712 --> 11:52.012
All over.

11:52.032 --> 11:53.113
You just keep picking them up.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.777
You never know where you're going to get them.

11:56.797 --> 11:58.158
All those horizontal stripes.

11:58.178 --> 11:59.339
What the hell is going on there?

11:59.359 --> 12:00.981
That must have been a fashion, right?

12:01.341 --> 12:03.103
At a given point, it came into being.

12:03.143 --> 12:03.864
It was a fashion.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.127
I love these where they have their names.

12:08.589 --> 12:08.949
A.C.

12:08.969 --> 12:09.470
Livingston.

12:09.950 --> 12:17.077
This is a Brindley one here somewhere.

12:17.097 --> 12:17.758
But Joe Verona.

12:18.683 --> 12:20.745
I'll show you a nice book when I get back.

12:20.765 --> 12:23.607
Here's another vellum book, you know, a little bit different.

12:23.627 --> 12:24.508
That's nice.

12:24.528 --> 12:31.274
But what I'm saying is that someone said to me, did I do crawl announcers, did I check this, did I check the other thing?

12:32.495 --> 12:34.396
And the answer is no.

12:36.018 --> 12:36.918
How many?

12:39.020 --> 12:39.721
I don't know.

12:39.741 --> 12:40.501
18, 19, 20.

12:40.521 --> 12:43.344
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

12:43.364 --> 12:45.305
So that's 30 times 7.

12:45.325 --> 12:46.767
That's 210 times 4.

12:46.787 --> 12:48.048
It's about 1,000 books here.

12:48.168 --> 12:48.488
Yeah.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.153
A thousand beautiful books.

12:52.493 --> 12:52.834
Nice books.

12:52.854 --> 12:53.715
Yeah.

12:53.735 --> 12:54.896
Maybe, give or take a hundred.

12:54.937 --> 12:55.878
Yeah, and interesting.

12:56.238 --> 12:58.201
But this is only basically 19th century.

12:58.482 --> 13:01.606
Now, when you get to 18th century... Yeah.

13:01.626 --> 13:02.748
But, I mean, I can show you.

13:02.828 --> 13:07.935
Here, let me show you where... You become a collector.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.640
Why does that become instantly, poof, you're a collector?

13:12.160 --> 13:15.285
It doesn't happen that way.

13:15.305 --> 13:29.328
It is something that evolves in all sorts of complex ways, and there comes a point of maturity in collecting.

13:29.348 --> 13:32.093
What you want to call it, and you said to me earlier,

13:32.528 --> 13:39.257
When did it come upon you that you realized you were madly infatuated... Something like that.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.501
...and totally maniacal about... Whatever you want to put in.

13:42.741 --> 13:43.142
You put it.

13:43.542 --> 13:49.911
The question is, when does your collection... This may be an interesting aspect.

13:50.411 --> 13:54.417
When does your collection expand beyond yourself?

13:54.437 --> 13:57.000
When does it have... Well, when does a collection own you?

13:57.402 --> 14:21.891
not know dick manny says his collection owns him he says he has the most sophisticated security system in the world and even he said quote unquote and even then he will not leave the house without somebody in there that is 180 degrees off from you dick manny that's fine and i'm not asking you to comment on him i'm just giving you something i understand but i'm not talking about the collection owning

14:22.192 --> 14:23.053
He said that.

14:23.293 --> 14:24.675
The collection owns me.

14:24.876 --> 14:27.299
Why does the collection own him?

14:27.319 --> 14:28.581
What does he mean by it?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.543
It's an interesting thing that you want to understand.

14:30.563 --> 14:36.311
What is so important to him that he is possessed by it and by its loss?

14:36.331 --> 14:39.575
Well, he's probably got 20 million or something like that.

14:39.595 --> 14:42.179
I don't believe he has that much money.

14:42.259 --> 14:43.621
Well, I'm just saying throw that out.

14:43.641 --> 14:44.282
But it's money.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.103
But it's money.

14:45.183 --> 14:46.364
It's money.

14:46.445 --> 14:48.267
He did mention X million dollars.

14:48.247 --> 14:49.189
of dollars.

14:49.209 --> 14:53.035
Yes, but I think he has much more X million dollars in furniture and art.

14:53.236 --> 14:58.485
Yeah, but I think he's talking about the whole Shul Amil when he says that too.

14:58.725 --> 15:01.109
You know, he's talking in general about the passion.

15:01.129 --> 15:03.654
Did I lose something or not?

15:05.297 --> 15:11.908
What I'm saying is that Manny as a collector has a major collection.

15:12.665 --> 15:15.688
that is worth a great deal of money.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.169
It's a high spot collection.

15:17.189 --> 15:18.150
Well, it's not a question.

15:18.170 --> 15:22.254
You're talking books and I'm talking about the fact that Manny came into books late in life.

15:22.474 --> 15:23.134
Seven years ago.

15:23.335 --> 15:27.899
He was much more a collector of American furniture and possibly American art.

15:27.919 --> 15:28.880
I don't know.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.185
But his holding of furniture and antiques economically is far greater than his books.

15:35.205 --> 15:35.626
Okay.

15:36.106 --> 15:39.930
What I'm saying to you is that when Manny says he owns his collection.

15:39.950 --> 15:40.810
No, the collection owns him.

15:40.830 --> 15:41.791
The collection owns him.

15:42.031 --> 15:42.672
Manny...

15:42.652 --> 15:46.350
is not a major

15:46.786 --> 15:52.673
whether Manny is a major or not major collector, Manny spends a lot of money on his collections.

15:52.693 --> 15:55.357
He's a major collector of American furniture.

15:55.437 --> 15:56.778
He's not a major collector of books.

15:57.439 --> 16:00.783
He may spend a lot of money on books, but he's not... I think we know that, yeah.

16:00.863 --> 16:06.170
And I'm not going to flail that, but we all understand that.

16:06.310 --> 16:09.034
What I'm saying, however... He's got a lovely collection.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.636
He overpaid on the Shakespeare's.

16:10.736 --> 16:11.216
It doesn't matter.

16:11.236 --> 16:11.817
He's got it.

16:12.558 --> 16:12.858
You know?

16:13.479 --> 16:14.040
He's got it.

16:14.140 --> 16:14.560
That's all.

16:14.580 --> 16:15.882
He didn't overpay.

16:15.862 --> 16:18.185
And there was an underbidder, too.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.046
Exactly.

16:19.066 --> 16:20.228
He's got the Shakespeare.

16:20.248 --> 16:21.609
It's fine.

16:21.629 --> 16:21.729
Okay.

16:21.749 --> 16:32.103
Now, the point I'm getting at, what I was trying to say, you said to me, when did my books overwhelm and captivate me or capture me?

16:32.123 --> 16:34.425
Or, as you put it, own me.

16:35.026 --> 16:35.667
Possess you.

16:35.687 --> 16:38.150
I put it a little differently.

16:38.170 --> 16:41.194
Pull you by the pecker as opposed to whatever.

16:42.575 --> 16:54.272
My feeling is, and the way I would look at it, is when does a collection become important in and of itself
