WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:07.756
Sorry, but just tell me your name again.

00:07.797 --> 00:09.659
I'm John Christensen.

00:09.679 --> 00:11.701
I'm the director of admissions at St.

00:11.721 --> 00:12.141
John's College.

00:12.321 --> 00:14.664
And this is a position you've known for how long?

00:14.684 --> 00:15.685
20 years.

00:15.705 --> 00:16.065
20 years.

00:16.186 --> 00:17.627
So, yeah, it's been a long time.

00:17.687 --> 00:18.788
Pretty interesting time.

00:19.729 --> 00:20.070
Mm-hmm.

00:20.951 --> 00:21.191
Yeah.

00:21.211 --> 00:22.593
It has been.

00:22.613 --> 00:30.701
Unlike a lot of people, if you like the college and like what it does, you come, and if things work right, you're likely to stay and not want them.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.403
That's what's happened to me.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.244
And where are you from, John?

00:34.102 --> 00:37.086
I'm actually born late in California.

00:38.668 --> 00:40.590
I'm one of those natives out there.

00:40.610 --> 00:43.213
I always thought I would go back, but never made it.

00:43.634 --> 00:44.515
Where did you go to school?

00:45.116 --> 00:47.779
I went to the University of California as an undergraduate.

00:48.700 --> 00:52.344
I graduated from Santa Barbara and went to Berkeley for a while.

00:53.506 --> 00:58.912
I went to graduate school at Northwestern and got a degree and a Ph.D.

00:59.033 --> 01:02.657
in English literature.

01:02.907 --> 01:07.293
briefly at Hofstra University and the University of Rhode Island before coming here.

01:07.313 --> 01:16.486
I got out of graduate school in the days where there were no jobs for people with degrees in their early 70s.

01:16.506 --> 01:18.649
I guess the market is much better now.

01:19.130 --> 01:22.194
Marginally better, I think.

01:22.674 --> 01:24.056
Yeah.

01:25.058 --> 01:28.242
Did you expect to get into administration and admissions?

01:28.262 --> 01:32.408
No, but when I was at the University of Rhode Island, realizing that I

01:32.793 --> 01:41.903
I had been doing a sabbatical replacement job, and I was tired of that, but I knew I wanted to stay in higher education.

01:41.923 --> 01:44.886
So I was looking for things to do.

01:45.346 --> 01:50.792
I did some administrative work, very little, but I saw them in their adult education program.

01:50.892 --> 01:59.982
A friend of mine knew I was looking for things outside of a traditional department, and she happened to be on the reading list

02:00.265 --> 02:28.112
the mailing list for this college just because she was interested in the reading that's done here and the kinds of things that she can take up and so she'd written for information asked to be placed on the reading list and she got a job announcement and she knew that this would be an interesting place and that i might like it so i looked into it i wrote a letter i came and i got the job and i've been here ever since

02:28.379 --> 02:32.884
Did the Great Books concept appeal and attract you?

02:32.924 --> 02:33.705
Yes, very much.

02:34.165 --> 02:42.955
I was very interested in the Great Books idea, but particularly in the interdisciplinary dimension of it.

02:43.455 --> 02:55.348
One of the things I always felt in my own education was a lack of comprehension and familiarity with much about math and science.

02:55.632 --> 03:08.512
did just find those subjects in high school that had long since really forgotten anything and was, like most people, at least like many people, unhappy with the kind of rope approach to math and science that you get in high school.

03:09.814 --> 03:21.492
When I went to graduate school, I became interested in the 19th century, British fiction in particular, and the great social changes from the late Victorian period, in particular in the 20th century.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.715
One of the things that I ended up writing about

03:24.708 --> 03:29.433
was the impact of science and technology on literary theory and practice.

03:32.576 --> 03:43.387
I'd always felt like I would have done a much better job in graduate school if I'd actually had some grounding in something other than humanities.

03:43.867 --> 03:50.614
This program appealed to me very much on account of its broad-based nature and

03:51.033 --> 04:00.445
the fact that everything was an original text that we read here.

04:01.766 --> 04:14.222
Like everyone else, at some point in college, Western Civ courses that were required, you hear about Galileo, you hear about Copernicus, you hear about Descartes, but very few people actually ever read them.

04:14.282 --> 04:16.264
So the notion of undergraduates here

04:16.835 --> 04:19.659
really sitting down and coming to grips with those books.

04:19.679 --> 04:23.905
At the same time, they're reading great works of literature.

04:24.626 --> 04:27.851
Really fascinating.

04:27.871 --> 04:33.279
As a director of admissions, what are you looking for in that book?

04:33.299 --> 04:44.715
Here, it's very interesting because to some degree, if you compare the profile of many of our students with those at selective institutions around the country, we would look like we have

04:45.286 --> 04:48.970
a lot of very strong students and that we are a selective institution.

04:49.650 --> 05:03.124
We are different from those colleges that we compete with in the sense that we are not looking to drum up huge numbers of applicants only to reject everything but what we see as the cream of the crop.

05:03.444 --> 05:06.127
Instead, we are really looking for reasons to take people.

05:08.049 --> 05:10.551
While our application process resembles that at other

05:11.392 --> 05:15.798
What we have at the core of ours is a set of application essays.

05:16.299 --> 05:24.610
We're really reading those to see, does the student understand what we do and how it differs from what they would be doing at a more conventionally structured institution?

05:25.632 --> 05:38.209
Do they have some reason for believing that this is the approach to education that they want to take and that it has something to do with the way in which they learn that?

05:38.830 --> 06:03.623
We are looking for people who want to do this, and if they want to do it, make a plausible case that they understand what it is and that they really do want to do it, what we're then checking to see is do they have the fundamental skills, but our assumption is not that we're going to take only those students with the highest test scores and highest GPA.

06:03.822 --> 06:09.549
We don't actually require any standardized tests.

06:09.569 --> 06:13.434
The college took that stand many, many years ago, and we don't require them.

06:14.015 --> 06:21.484
It turns out that probably 90% of the students either submit them or we find them in their secondary school report.

06:21.504 --> 06:22.705
Yeah, they're quite competitive.

06:23.206 --> 06:29.053
Combined, let's see, the combined average

06:29.371 --> 06:32.354
This last fall's class is probably 1380, 1390.

06:32.514 --> 06:33.915
It's close to 1400.

06:33.995 --> 06:37.258
It's very competitive.

06:38.019 --> 06:46.866
But as I say, we look at those kinds of things as, we don't try to make some distinction between people who have 1380 as opposed to 1360 or something like that.

06:47.267 --> 06:59.057
It's really, do the scores when we have them and the record, have whatever it is, show that they have the kind of minimum competency in subjects in which we have long sequences, math,

06:59.358 --> 07:02.122
science and foreign languages in particular.

07:02.442 --> 07:11.495
So if they can do the work, and then their essay shows that they really do want to do it and have some real understanding of it, then we're going to take them.

07:11.515 --> 07:22.491
One of the interesting things about the college, I think, is that it's really, at heart, very fundamentally democratic.

07:22.992 --> 07:25.876
The founders of the program did not think that this was elitist.

07:25.976 --> 07:28.099
They thought that the books that we read should be

07:28.433 --> 07:34.481
in some sense part of any educated citizen's knowledge.

07:35.743 --> 07:51.083
People in a democracy should have some considerable acquaintance with those works that have shaped the modern world in all of its branches, from math and science to literature and philosophy.

07:51.103 --> 07:55.649
So the assumption here really is that there's going to be a range of students.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.411
It's not going to be just the most

07:57.627 --> 08:10.906
But let me say, having spent, you know, almost four hours, and this is just a visual, non-scientific examination, but I think I've seen maybe one non-white person.

08:10.926 --> 08:22.723
Yeah, minority representation is about 11%, which is not as high as we would like it, but it's pretty much on the par with a lot of the places that we would overlap with, small liberal arts colleges.

08:22.805 --> 08:24.567
Are you looking for diversity?

08:24.627 --> 08:32.778
Yeah, I was just talking about my daughter who is a kid in high school.

08:32.798 --> 08:35.862
We really are trying to get diversity here.

08:35.942 --> 08:38.325
She said, this is the whitest state in America.

08:39.667 --> 08:43.872
And, you know, everybody tends to reflect that.

08:44.052 --> 08:47.096
And so they try to make my head even affirmative.

08:47.116 --> 08:50.140
You know what I'm saying?

08:50.300 --> 08:52.423
Trying to balance the student body.

08:52.792 --> 08:59.280
Do you find that what you offer here does appeal to the minority students?

08:59.340 --> 09:05.447
Just as it appeals to only very few majority students, it appeals to only very few minority students.

09:06.248 --> 09:11.954
We've done things that were targeted to minority populations, and they were just flopped.

09:12.054 --> 09:20.284
We've done a special mailing through the student search service they have.

09:20.922 --> 09:29.853
Now, one could say maybe we didn't send the right messages or whatever, but we try to tell them what we tell everybody else, what we do, and those kinds of efforts failed.

09:30.734 --> 09:41.427
What has simply happened here, I think, is that the college has begun to reflect the changing American world.

09:41.487 --> 09:49.697
In other words, if you walk around on campus, it's true you won't see very many minorities, but you'll see more Hispanic students, more Indian students.

09:50.318 --> 10:01.868
of Indian extraction from India, you'll see a handful of African-American students, maybe 2-3% in a given year.

10:02.108 --> 10:04.570
That's very different than it was 20 years ago.

10:04.590 --> 10:08.694
When I came 20 years ago, there was one black student the whole time I was here.

10:11.796 --> 10:19.583
We've changed a little bit, but I think it's just because it's not through any particular effort we've undertaken, except

10:20.052 --> 10:21.814
generally to get our name out.

10:21.834 --> 10:27.520
And as our name has gotten out to more and more people, friends tend to bring friends.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.582
Contacts tend to have contacts.

10:29.602 --> 10:37.330
And so the few first adventuresome sort of minority students who got here have subsequently brought friends.

10:38.672 --> 10:49.283
I don't think this program... Well, to say something else about it, I think that minority students

10:49.786 --> 11:02.664
Those of us in college admissions are often worried about approaching minority students as though they're minority students, because they can sometimes resent it, in the sense that they want to be treated just like anybody else.

11:04.086 --> 11:18.105
I can think of a minority student here, a woman who transferred from Penn, who turned down a national science award for African Americans on the grounds that she would not take anything just because she was a minority student.

11:18.541 --> 11:28.371
But this is all by the way of saying that those minority students who are interested in what we do here, I think are interested, obviously, for the same reasons majority students are.

11:28.932 --> 11:31.495
We can't go to somebody and say, look, if you come to St.

11:31.535 --> 11:46.270
John's, there's a terrific Afro-American studies program, or we don't have a, you couldn't say to a minority student, well, you'll find there's a lot of minority students and a big student African-American

11:46.705 --> 11:48.767
We just don't have any of that.

11:48.787 --> 11:53.971
If you want to come here, you're going to pretty much just fall into the main industry.

11:53.991 --> 12:04.400
I do think that the college is a good place in that sense, that people are, I think, pretty much tolerant, pretty much inclusive.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.723
The college doesn't seem to divide up into little factions.

12:07.783 --> 12:11.046
There are some, but not very many.

12:11.066 --> 12:15.750
I think the presumptuous of me to speak for

12:15.967 --> 12:41.181
minority students who were here but those that i know have talked about who i think just kind of feel like you're just coming you're part of the mainstream and that's the end of it and i asked some of those kids that i had lunch yesterday and a lot of criticism that you that you see with this cultural debate and really this is why i'm here when i was right about this in a way i mean the more i look at this cultural debate

12:41.684 --> 12:43.607
the less interesting I find it everywhere.

12:44.027 --> 12:46.430
Because I'm not going to resolve anything.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.653
It's an itch to them.

12:48.673 --> 12:51.737
I thought, well, let's just go where are the books.

12:53.319 --> 12:55.222
Here are the books, and this is what they're doing.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.586
But I also said to these kids, do you feel like you're out of touch with the rest of the world?

13:00.188 --> 13:04.154
Some of you said, yeah.

13:05.495 --> 13:08.940
And one young woman said she hadn't even read the newspapers, possibly.

13:09.578 --> 13:14.705
and that books are preparing her for more intensive reading.

13:15.566 --> 13:17.248
But I guess the question is what you hear.

13:17.268 --> 13:26.079
A lot of people feel that books, literature, should be relevant.

13:26.099 --> 13:28.502
I asked this question to Helen Bendler.

13:28.522 --> 13:33.649
How do you respond to people who say, I don't read Shakespeare because Shakespeare is not relevant.

13:33.669 --> 13:35.932
And she said, what is relevant?

13:35.952 --> 13:38.455
She said, a work of art is relevant, period.

13:38.722 --> 13:41.745
That's its own relevance.

13:41.765 --> 13:47.370
I don't know if that's a question, but do you have any thoughts on that?

13:47.490 --> 13:55.198
On that debate, on the question of relevance and, I guess, the eternal nature of the great folks?

13:55.218 --> 14:05.067
Well, I guess there's not going to be anything new or particularly insightful, but it's interesting, I think, with respect to the multicultural business.

14:06.008 --> 14:16.622
One of the things I always try to talk with counselors and others who come in groups, and somebody always asks the question, well, you don't have very much that represents blacks, or you don't have very much that represents women.

14:17.463 --> 14:21.168
And the point I try to make to them is, no, we don't, because that's not what we're about here.

14:21.208 --> 14:26.255
All of the books that we read claim something universal about human experience.

14:27.316 --> 14:31.242
And that's what I think is at the heart and very important.

14:31.262 --> 14:35.307
At the heart of what we do, it's very important to understand that we always

14:35.489 --> 14:43.717
to read and talk about things that are common to us all as human beings, whether we're white, black, men, or women, whatever.

14:45.338 --> 14:56.289
To some extent, the emphasis on multiculturalism may be driving people into their own factions and separating us more than we really understand.

14:56.529 --> 15:01.234
This program, what we do here, is to some extent corrected in a way.

15:01.894 --> 15:04.737
It speaks to us in some universal way.

15:05.476 --> 15:16.133
It makes claims about how we experience space and time, not because you're black or white, but because Kant says that's the nature of man's time.

15:16.694 --> 15:26.269
I think students, my sense of it is that when reading student applications is that the kids are not unaware of these kinds of issues

15:26.992 --> 15:35.119
They're alert, bright kids in a high school world where all kinds of stuff is going on, and they're aware of the multicultural issues.

15:35.299 --> 15:40.264
Many of them come from high schools and communities that are quite diverse.

15:40.324 --> 15:48.031
Yet there's something timeless about these books, something that strikes them, and they're willing to step out of that world and come.

15:49.973 --> 15:55.918
These works, the way we approach them, strikes a real chord.

15:56.067 --> 16:12.127
Maybe it is that there's something there that they sense as permanent or always important in the midst of all the shifts they're going through, that they're looking for something that's a persistent kind of human question.

16:12.147 --> 16:23.943
After all, we read books that talk about truth or bravery or what it means to be virtuous.

16:24.243 --> 16:25.905
I mean, those are all things that

16:26.341 --> 16:48.957
young people struggle with uh so something about what we do i think strikes at that kind of idealistic part of young people searching for something that's really the best and thinking that somehow the books and the way with which we're going to talk about the books here is a repository of that sort of knowledge or reason i asked many young people i had lunch with today

16:49.797 --> 16:53.681
any of these 120 or so books that were impenetrable for you.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.864
Yes, there are books.

16:57.925 --> 17:02.910
Harvey is tough without the support system and the discussions.

17:03.270 --> 17:05.072
Copernicus, of course, is tough.

17:07.554 --> 17:12.519
I'm wondering, because I haven't been to a math class, and math was devastating for me.

17:12.539 --> 17:15.602
How do you teach math by reading books?

17:15.835 --> 17:18.138
and whomever it is that you read.

17:18.418 --> 17:21.182
I'm not the best person to talk about that.

17:21.262 --> 17:28.030
You say that math and science are very fundamental here as part of the four years, and it goes through four years.

17:28.550 --> 17:29.131
Is that right?

17:29.732 --> 17:32.435
But we also go beyond the reading of the books, right?

17:32.455 --> 17:36.500
We deal with problems and finding solutions.

17:36.901 --> 17:38.743
Well, yeah, that's right.

17:39.544 --> 17:44.610
I guess one thing, the faculty might wince about this.

17:44.894 --> 17:54.186
Maybe not quite true, but to some extent, you know, the math and science sequences are more theoretical than they are applied.

17:54.266 --> 18:02.416
I mean, we're trying to get people to think about what is the mathematical object?

18:02.556 --> 18:05.340
I mean, what can be described by mathematics?

18:06.101 --> 18:11.728
Can there be good things mathematically, and bad things, or beautiful and ugly things?

18:12.350 --> 18:14.872
So what is the nature of mathematics?

18:15.033 --> 18:17.375
What does it tell us about the world in which we live?

18:18.316 --> 18:27.384
The same kind of thing is thought about in science, that how do hypothesis and experiment and conclusions work?

18:27.424 --> 18:31.528
What is it that we know when we've demonstrated something?

18:31.768 --> 18:42.238
So I think for a lot of students who, even students who have excelled in math and science in high school, as well as for those who've struggled through them,

18:42.758 --> 18:53.633
The approach that we have is a little bit different, and for the first time here, math and science sometimes become not only enjoyable, but comprehensible to some degree.

18:53.653 --> 18:56.517
You sort of understand how it progressed penetrably.

18:56.998 --> 18:58.720
Yes, penetrably.

18:58.740 --> 19:11.398
How it progressed in Western civilization, at least in some broad, general way, you can understand distinctions between ancient mathematics and modern mathematics, and the kinds of claims that might be made about

19:11.750 --> 19:41.706
something in the past and our skepticism about them now and that maybe tells us the example people always give is that when we read Ptolemy in the first two years we know that Ptolemy's wrong but after you read Ptolemy and you have someone give a beautiful and convincing explanation of the organization of the heavens in which all is apparently accounted for but you know it's wrong you're a lot more skeptical about

19:42.226 --> 19:51.277
accepting other sorts of things, other sorts of plausible explanations.

19:52.979 --> 20:01.209
So I think that it's that kind of thing that we try to get at in math and science.

20:01.229 --> 20:04.993
We do do problem solving, but it doesn't take the form of

20:05.648 --> 20:08.373
here's a form I'd go home, solve these problems.

20:08.753 --> 20:15.385
It takes the form of coming to class and working on problems together in the classroom.

20:15.405 --> 20:20.093
So it's not that kind of isolated drilling sort of experience.

20:20.113 --> 20:22.737
It's thinking and asking questions about things.

20:22.757 --> 20:24.560
We don't have examinations, per se.

20:25.382 --> 20:27.285
No written examinations.

20:27.687 --> 20:30.070
Do students have to write papers, do they?

20:30.130 --> 20:36.179
Yeah, there are four or five short papers for math and language and lab over the course of a year.

20:36.439 --> 20:41.146
And then every year each student writes what we call the annual essay.

20:41.166 --> 20:47.355
That's turned in on the second semester to seminar tutors.

20:48.236 --> 20:50.539
And it's an essay on anything that

20:54.029 --> 21:01.693
It's an essay on anything that's been of interest to them that year and approved by their two seminars.

21:01.713 --> 21:06.688
It's meant to be a lengthy and important

21:07.985 --> 21:13.755
essay, in the real sense of that word, not a research paper, they're really supposed to come to grips with something else.

21:13.795 --> 21:15.078
How long is it supposed to be?

21:15.538 --> 21:19.485
I think they're probably typically 20 pages or more.

21:19.505 --> 21:32.288
The one that's turned in in the senior year, which is turned into the faculty as a whole and is called a senior essay and all that, those can often run to

21:33.044 --> 21:38.972
Are they focused?

21:39.032 --> 21:40.734
Again, to varying degrees.

21:41.035 --> 21:42.677
Are they footnoted?

21:42.697 --> 21:49.866
Do they follow MLA style guidelines?

21:50.928 --> 21:52.610
The quality?

21:53.171 --> 21:58.798
I don't know that we insist on any particular style like the MLA style sheet or something.

21:58.964 --> 22:07.053
They may be footnoted for reasons, but again, they would distinctly not be a research paper.

22:11.357 --> 22:25.292
I guess the criterion by which we often judge the papers for the purposes of accepting them or not is, is this paper something that you could stand a public oral examination on for about an hour

22:25.677 --> 22:28.861
and have a profitable experience in which we'd all learn.

22:30.022 --> 22:44.419
In other words, you might get a paper written that structurally is not that good, it's weak writing, but nonetheless raises issues that are important to the student that are insightful and worth talking about.

22:47.042 --> 22:54.030
The range of what's written in terms of its quality is quite broad, as is

22:54.922 --> 23:01.209
whether or not it's a particularly focused essay or far-ranging.

23:01.229 --> 23:09.018
But it's to get the students to really think on their own about something that's very important to them and try to write a real essay.

23:09.038 --> 23:13.743
But you say it's not research, so you're really not required to go into the library.

23:15.765 --> 23:24.675
Not required to, probably not quite forbidden, but it's really supposed to be you thinking through some issue that you've defined

23:25.027 --> 23:26.970
You do have reference to sources?

23:27.891 --> 23:36.823
On a book or a series of books maybe that we've read here at the college, sometimes people will choose something that we haven't read.

23:37.384 --> 23:41.129
In which case, you try to find somebody who's willing to deal with it.

23:41.189 --> 23:49.841
Some years ago, we had a student who wanted to write about the fairy queen, and I was unfortunately one of the few people who'd read the fairy queen.

23:49.861 --> 23:50.582
I didn't know anybody.

23:50.722 --> 23:54.848
And got drafted into being willing to read the script.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.256
So I don't remember all about his paper.

23:57.296 --> 24:00.380
It was on mutability cancers in particular.

24:00.900 --> 24:15.099
Yeah, he brought in many other works that we've read about the question of change and the question of death and regeneration and so forth, and tried to understand the fairy queen from those points of view.

24:15.179 --> 24:17.021
Look at it.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.885
But it's not just a paper that's submitted.

24:19.925 --> 24:23.890
You discussed it, and then they introduced... In the senior year,

24:24.376 --> 24:27.959
The senior essay is submitted to the faculty as a whole.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.561
But they approve of the subject.

24:30.581 --> 24:31.162
That's right.

24:31.182 --> 24:52.881
You will have had an advisor who will have tried to get you to focus this and clarify it, and that advisor may well have seen early drafts of the paper and tried to help you refine your ideas or put them into shape.

24:53.401 --> 25:00.411
And then when the paper is done, it's turned into the faculty as a whole, then there's a committee that reads it.

25:00.431 --> 25:07.942
And when that committee reads it, amongst the members, which will be three, they decide whether or not this is an acceptable paper.

25:07.982 --> 25:13.330
And then if it is an acceptable paper, then a public oral exam is scheduled for it.

25:13.410 --> 25:15.753
And that committee will examine the students.

25:15.893 --> 25:17.155
Every student is examined.

25:17.255 --> 25:19.138
Every graduating senior has to have

25:19.692 --> 25:24.481
And paper accepted and stand a successful oral defense on it.

25:25.863 --> 25:27.646
And how long did it take?

25:27.666 --> 25:28.067
About an hour.

25:28.368 --> 25:28.648
Really?

25:29.329 --> 25:31.794
How long is it for faculty?

25:31.814 --> 25:34.799
Probably about 65 or 70.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.087
And this is a big burden in this time.

25:39.107 --> 25:40.890
I'm afraid we've got a hundred seniors.

25:41.326 --> 25:45.292
You're on a lot of committee.

25:46.054 --> 25:47.436
What if it's not an acceptable paper?

25:48.437 --> 25:57.211
If it was not an acceptable paper, there's a period in which it can be rewritten and resubmitted.

25:58.453 --> 26:01.017
That would be not uncommon.

26:01.578 --> 26:08.970
You go back to your advisor and you get some advice and you try to whip it into shape and get it accepted.

26:09.136 --> 26:14.883
It's possible, and it has happened that people have just choked and haven't been able to do it, which means you don't graduate.

26:15.003 --> 26:18.207
You've got to then submit a paper.

26:18.287 --> 26:25.535
Now, I mean, in some cases, people have postponed doing that and getting their degree for a year or two or three or four years.

26:26.797 --> 26:34.426
Usually, though, of course, the faculty does everything within their power to get the person through and get them to graduate.

26:34.446 --> 26:36.949
It's less likely, but it has

26:37.722 --> 26:39.604
Thank you so much.

26:39.684 --> 26:41.706
I appreciate it.

26:41.946 --> 26:57.223
One could write a successful paper and then fail the oral examination, but that would really be unusual, and that's all likely that it would be someone who just panicked the public and it would reschedule.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.744
And this is rare?

26:59.105 --> 27:00.126
That would be very rare.

27:00.206 --> 27:02.388
What's the attrition rate?

27:02.408 --> 27:04.050
Let's do a bit of class.

27:04.351 --> 27:11.379
We graduate about 70 to 72 percent of the students that we enrolled.

27:11.399 --> 27:12.740
That's not in four years.

27:14.062 --> 27:24.513
The Department of Education uses a six-year standard, and that's what most colleges and universities should be reporting when they're reporting the standard.

27:24.533 --> 27:33.143
In four years, we probably graduate between 55 and 60 percent, something like that.

27:33.663 --> 27:59.063
Who do you discourage from applying here?

27:59.988 --> 28:01.930
I've got my daughter with me.

28:01.990 --> 28:02.351
Yeah.

28:03.332 --> 28:03.953
Do you do this?

28:03.973 --> 28:06.456
By the way, do you discourage parents from coming in with this?

28:07.137 --> 28:08.458
No, we like to have parents come along.

28:08.498 --> 28:10.040
We're happy to talk to them.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.182
College is unusual enough.

28:11.202 --> 28:16.328
There are a lot of issues and questions, so we're happy to address them.

28:17.069 --> 28:28.122
One kind of student that we would discourage would be someone who has a weak background in one of the subjects I mentioned, math or science or

28:28.945 --> 28:34.370
languages where we have long sequences where you really have to have a certain level of confidence.

28:36.192 --> 28:43.539
If you're just weak in, say, math, the chances of you getting through junior and senior lab are not high.

28:44.260 --> 28:49.405
You don't want to be a junior and senior and fail a part of the program because it's all required and you can't go on.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.807
You're just stuck.

28:51.827 --> 28:56.151
The other kind of person that we would discourage would be someone who's

28:57.194 --> 29:12.230
application essays really showed an unlikely that they would be capable of writing successful essays in each of the four years.

29:12.250 --> 29:20.118
In other words, the writing is either structurally weak, really weak, or they just don't have anything to say.

29:20.238 --> 29:23.742
Superficial.

29:25.696 --> 29:39.309
I shouldn't say that we discourage anybody, but there are often misperceptions about the program, and the most common is that we only do literature and philosophy here.

29:39.329 --> 29:54.724
Most people tend to associate the college with what we call seminar, which is that part where we read philosophy, literature, history, stuff that would be in humanities departments elsewhere, and students forget that half of the program are readings in

29:54.940 --> 29:57.983
mathematics and natural sciences.

29:58.003 --> 30:07.252
So you don't want us to come in with that kind of misconception about how half of this time is going to be spent in the four years here.

30:09.234 --> 30:21.927
There is also one other sort of person that we try to discourage or certainly reject when we really detect it, and that's the kind of person who already knows that they know everything.

30:22.345 --> 30:26.010
and who's not willing to listen to other people.

30:26.050 --> 30:29.995
I've had students come for interviews and ask questions like this.

30:30.055 --> 30:35.061
Well, what if I went to a seminar and they asked the opening question and I knew the answer?

30:36.283 --> 30:37.424
Wouldn't that be the end of it?

30:38.806 --> 30:43.092
Well, you know, I don't think you understand things.

30:43.112 --> 30:49.500
I mean, the kind of question that we're going to ask you isn't going to be something that you're the only person that has the answer to.

30:49.649 --> 30:59.344
But there are people who have that attitude that I'm pretty sharp, I know a lot of stuff, and I would be the one who would win the arguments in class or be the one that had the right answer.

30:59.364 --> 31:09.118
It's kind of intolerance and lack of imagination that there can be give and take or that people could disagree over in serious matters and have an important discussion about.

31:09.439 --> 31:13.665
What for you is your most revealing question?

31:14.246 --> 31:16.129
I'm 17 years old.

31:16.936 --> 31:21.824
I'm down from knowing what they're looking at.

31:21.904 --> 31:28.194
I'm not asking if you don't continue on the end, but I guess I'm interested to know what you want to know about me.

31:32.100 --> 31:43.298
I must say that in the interviews, the kinds of questions I ask are not ones where they might be sort of hauling to other places to try to get them to reveal themselves.

31:43.801 --> 31:44.902
They're ready for that.

31:45.143 --> 31:48.207
Yeah, they're ready for that.

31:49.629 --> 31:58.941
Usually what I ask them about is, well, you had obviously read about the college and were interested in it enough to come for a visit.

31:58.961 --> 32:06.771
Now, is it what you thought it was, or is it appreciably different from what you imagined it would be?

32:07.055 --> 32:18.213
The reason I ask that question of everybody I interview is we really try to get them to see as clearly as we can what it is we do and whether or not it's right for them.

32:18.233 --> 32:28.489
In other words, we do want the admissions process to remain what we say it is now, largely self-selective, so that we really want the student to know

32:29.161 --> 32:35.449
Gee, I came thinking that these were all warm and fuzzy discussions.

32:35.469 --> 32:42.519
We could sit around and say cool things, but really they're actually very rigorous, and they really push you to refine your ideas.

32:42.539 --> 32:43.941
Is that what I want?

32:44.201 --> 32:51.271
Do I want my ideas scrutinized, even attacked politely, by others in class?

32:51.391 --> 32:52.432
Is that what I want?

32:52.953 --> 32:54.595
So I try to find out from them

32:55.013 --> 33:00.399
is the disparity between what they imagined, what myths they might have had about St.

33:00.419 --> 33:02.381
John's, and what they actually find out here.

33:03.802 --> 33:06.825
Because sometimes they discover other myths.

33:06.846 --> 33:20.180
Maybe they sit on a seminar where everybody seemed brilliant, and what they don't know is, well, if you'd come on some other night, it might have been a book that stumped them all, or certainly not everybody in the college is brilliant.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.383
You could come here and be successful.

33:23.482 --> 33:25.124
things like that.

33:26.185 --> 33:38.460
In terms of discouraging someone or really pressing them to think about it, that is the other trouble spot.

33:40.823 --> 33:43.286
It even happens with students who make the decision to come here.

33:43.326 --> 33:48.072
They think that they want to discuss, but the burden of doing it every day

33:49.047 --> 33:53.533
is too much and they either become quiet or they were not able to overcome their shyness.

33:53.553 --> 34:00.543
And so we often in faculty meetings talk about the problem of the silent student.

34:00.943 --> 34:03.186
How do you find ways to draw them out?

34:05.830 --> 34:10.296
We often talk as faculty when we teach

34:10.883 --> 34:22.035
about a student in the class and think of some strategy to pull that student out of his or her silence, because it's really here the exchange of ideas that is important.

34:22.135 --> 34:24.277
It's not just reading the books.

34:24.317 --> 34:31.925
The books are the occasion for you to talk to other people about important things.

34:33.047 --> 34:38.072
That's really, again, at the heart of what we think we're doing here.

34:39.065 --> 34:45.034
And so you can't just be somebody who says, well, I'm going to read the books and go to class and listen and collect the wisdom.

34:45.054 --> 34:48.239
There's no way to know how the student's doing.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.202
Absolutely right.

34:50.703 --> 35:02.642
For the faculty, it's a real burden, and with the student who remains silent, and the student that we can't find ways to draw out, they will often schedule

35:03.837 --> 35:07.542
a special conference and talk to a student about that conference.

35:07.562 --> 35:08.563
That was a question that I had.

35:08.583 --> 35:09.464
Do you teach, by the way?

35:09.684 --> 35:12.648
Yeah, infrequently, but from time to time.

35:13.048 --> 35:14.570
So what classes do you teach?

35:15.111 --> 35:22.460
When I teach, I almost all, well, I've always taught seminar because it meets in the evening and I still have my day job.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.384
So I'm only free at night.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.308
Tell me about this whole concept, the evening seminars.

35:28.588 --> 35:32.713
Yeah, seminar was determined to be what's right for the first time.

35:33.318 --> 35:38.544
The two-hour framework for the evening seminar is twice a week.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.206
I think everybody, right?

35:41.467 --> 35:43.770
Always meets Monday and Thursday from 8 to 10.

35:45.411 --> 36:02.110
As I understand this, at least, part of the reason for meeting in the evening was that, in a sense, the day's busy work is over, and if the discussion needs to go longer than two hours, you don't have to stop at the bell and get up and go to the next class.

36:02.900 --> 36:12.493
And you will find that seminars do often drift over half an hour or something like that.

36:12.513 --> 36:13.314
So that's part of it.

36:13.334 --> 36:13.995
It's practical.

36:14.015 --> 36:16.138
At the end of the day, there's space to go on.

36:16.158 --> 36:25.330
But I think it's also the case that there's something about having had dinner and coming and arriving for this evening discussion.

36:26.305 --> 36:34.662
in a formal way twice a week and with the leisure to talk to people.

36:36.447 --> 36:39.571
And the faculty, you call them the faculty, by the way?

36:39.672 --> 36:42.395
I'm calling them the faculty because everybody else gets confused.

36:42.415 --> 36:46.361
We call them tutors.

36:46.481 --> 36:50.006
All faculty here have the same rank and title, namely tutor.

36:50.487 --> 36:53.431
And it's borrowed from the British tradition.

36:54.552 --> 36:58.618
And it's not just a semantic difference from professor.

36:58.638 --> 37:03.585
It really is intended to convey the notion that

37:03.785 --> 37:27.649
faculty's business here is not to profess knowledge in a particular field of expertise it is instead the function of a tutor that is to say to facilitate the students learning learning that he or she is largely responsible but you must have tutors that specialize in the science end that's right everybody who comes back

37:28.608 --> 37:38.080
Most people who come to the college will be faculty who have training in traditional graduate departments and academic fields.

37:38.280 --> 37:42.285
But the interesting thing is, like the students, they have to teach across the curriculum, too.

37:42.305 --> 37:46.250
You cannot simply teach in your field of expertise.

37:46.270 --> 37:57.163
So if someone who, like me, if I had come to the college as a regular faculty person with a background in English literature, I might be

37:57.785 --> 38:07.618
more comfortable, let's say, in a seminar and maybe in a language tutorial, but I'm still going to have to teach freshman math and software math eventually.

38:07.718 --> 38:08.539
Will you get up to it?

38:09.761 --> 38:11.703
Well, you have to get up to it.

38:11.723 --> 38:12.805
You have to study yourself.

38:12.905 --> 38:13.105
Yes.

38:13.826 --> 38:24.180
A lot of that's accomplished through faculty study groups in which people with different kinds of expertise pass their expertise on to other faculty.

38:24.970 --> 38:29.516
preparation for classes that they will be running here.

38:30.637 --> 38:37.346
Many younger faculty will spend a good deal of their time maybe sitting in on other classes.

38:37.426 --> 38:46.117
You might, for example, be someone who's planning to teach Greek in a year or so, so you might want to audit some Greek classes if you don't know any Greek.

38:46.137 --> 38:47.719
And the students learn Greek?

38:49.101 --> 38:50.623
I mean, how do we do that?

38:51.481 --> 38:59.870
Yeah, actually for Greek we use a manual written by faculty here at the college.

38:59.890 --> 39:08.559
But we don't expect students in a foreign language tutorial to either become aware of the mastery of Greek and French.

39:08.939 --> 39:14.625
We do expect them all to get up to the ability to translate with a dictionary.

39:14.645 --> 39:21.252
So in the opening portions of freshman year, you just spend a lot of time doing the kind of memory work

39:21.721 --> 39:29.574
And I noticed today that memorization is important here.

39:29.675 --> 39:39.371
I was in a class where a young woman did a wonderful job to put this, J. Alfred Cuford.

39:39.451 --> 39:40.894
I was moved by it.

39:40.954 --> 39:42.857
I told her actually that that was really lovely.

39:42.877 --> 39:44.640
I said, I'm glad I was going to hear that.

39:45.143 --> 39:47.265
Yeah, that's actually a very interesting point.

39:47.526 --> 40:03.864
Much of what we do in the language tutorial is close attention to language, even if that means reading, doing a translation, say, from French to English poetry, or vice versa, simply to get people to really pay attention.

40:03.924 --> 40:10.932
So one of the exercises you can do, one of those old-fashioned things people always did, was memorize lines of poetry.

40:11.453 --> 40:12.754
Force yourself to really

40:13.291 --> 40:14.673
I didn't hear that one.

40:14.773 --> 40:17.998
I read George Steiner's big criticism of education too.

40:18.238 --> 40:19.640
Nobody read anything anymore.

40:19.761 --> 40:20.101
That's right.

40:20.141 --> 40:21.603
Yeah, they're no more favorite poems.

40:21.703 --> 40:22.485
No more favorite poems.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.728
We all had to do it.

40:24.908 --> 40:28.934
And, you know, when I was in college, I went to Bates up in Maine.

40:30.056 --> 40:35.003
And my two semester Shakespeare course, I mean, there were certain sonnets that we were required.

40:35.183 --> 40:41.813
And to just stay there with me, you know, and I'm enriched by them.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.843
Anything I haven't covered that's important to you?

40:45.063 --> 40:47.565
What would you like me to leave here with today?

40:47.666 --> 40:51.449
No, I think you can ask me about the things that I think really are important in the college.

40:51.830 --> 40:56.114
I wanted to give you, because I see you don't have it, a full-blown catalog.

40:58.196 --> 41:12.070
We call it a catalog, but it's really a statement of programming, so it's a narrative description of, say, the seminar and how it works out over four years, and a long narrative description of what we try to accomplish in the lab program.

41:12.168 --> 41:36.100
Let me get through that, and if you think of something while I'm pulling up the shelf... If you've got kids who are... to who sports mean a lot of...

41:36.282 --> 41:38.024
Big intramural sports program.

41:38.044 --> 41:41.149
Intramural sports are a real mainstay of college life here.

41:41.529 --> 41:43.272
You have a pool and all that good stuff.

41:43.292 --> 41:48.198
We don't have a pool, but there's a swimming group that uses a really nice Annapolis pool.

41:48.278 --> 41:54.747
There are a couple of things here in the extracurricular life that are really important to students.

41:55.588 --> 42:00.796
The intramural sports program, we have an extensive extracurricular arts program.

42:00.816 --> 42:02.578
There are lots of people that are interested in art.

42:02.638 --> 42:04.821
We don't formally teach the visual arts.

42:05.645 --> 42:06.966
We've got studio arts.

42:07.006 --> 42:08.027
We've got an art gallery.

42:08.047 --> 42:10.849
There are often lectures and things about art.

42:11.990 --> 42:16.955
There's also one of the persistent interests, as you might guess, of drama.

42:17.195 --> 42:22.159
There are a lot of kids who've been in theater in high school who want to continue here.

42:22.179 --> 42:26.042
So the drama group here is always very innovative.

42:26.783 --> 42:35.010
There's also a political forum, which is kind of characteristic of what students do here.

42:35.665 --> 42:49.443
Well, we know how to study any contemporary political theory, and so the political forum is a group that students put together to talk about contemporary political issues.

42:49.784 --> 42:53.248
But it happens to be a club that has a kind of formality that others don't.

42:53.268 --> 42:59.857
But what's really common here amongst students and faculty is extracurricular study groups.

42:59.877 --> 43:05.284
Students here are just as likely to form a group to study Hebrew as they are to

43:05.416 --> 43:10.741
form a group to read contemporary women writers and just have another class and just meet.

43:11.822 --> 43:22.111
One of the amazing things about this place is that, and I think this is great, education is seen as being fun.

43:22.131 --> 43:28.076
It's not a torture to do this work and to learn and to think about ideas and to share them with one another.

43:28.217 --> 43:32.641
It's seen as something desirable, something exciting, something that you can actually enjoy.

43:33.161 --> 43:35.423
Students here would not want to miss a class.

43:35.842 --> 43:38.504
That would just be very sad if you missed a class.

43:38.524 --> 43:39.725
What if a student does miss a class?

43:40.947 --> 43:51.396
We have attendances required at the college, and if a student misses a certain number of classes, they're throwing out of college.

43:51.436 --> 43:52.677
We don't tell them what that number is.

43:52.857 --> 43:56.941
There's a threshold, and when you cross it... But we don't have unlimited cuts, in other words.

43:56.961 --> 43:59.483
Actions don't have any cuts.

43:59.503 --> 43:59.863
That's right.

43:59.883 --> 44:02.806
It's required, and there's a... Attendance is required.

44:02.826 --> 44:04.988
Yeah, and there's a small number of...

44:05.778 --> 44:12.746
you can miss and you might get talked to about it and it won't be long after that if you miss more that you're asked to leave.

44:14.988 --> 44:19.473
You mentioned that there is no length in the faculty, but do you have tenure?

44:19.493 --> 44:20.895
Yes, there is tenure.

44:20.975 --> 44:22.917
How does that work?

44:24.119 --> 44:32.047
It is entirely...it doesn't have anything to do with publications.

44:32.288 --> 44:35.211
Though many of our faculty do publish,

44:36.035 --> 44:40.823
and some of them are quite accomplished in their fields.

44:40.843 --> 44:52.303
But the actual decision about tenure involves the ability to learn and work with students in this program.

44:52.383 --> 44:58.153
It's really focused on the institution as a teaching institution.

44:58.173 --> 45:00.557
So, for example, one of the things that will be looked at is

45:02.225 --> 45:10.313
A new tutor will be paired every year with a more senior tutor in seminars.

45:11.355 --> 45:19.383
So over four, five, or six years leading up to a tenure decision, there will be several faculty who know that person as a partner in class.

45:20.324 --> 45:29.093
There will be many others who might know them from conversations in the coffee shop, but also from faculty study groups.

45:30.136 --> 45:42.050
instruction committee that will be reaching the decision about tenure, we'll interview every senior that that faculty member has taught over his or her career here.

45:42.070 --> 45:45.174
And they take what the students have to say seriously.

45:45.194 --> 45:59.350
So there's a real conscientious effort to make certain that the person is able to do the work of the program across the board and that they really are working with students.

46:00.629 --> 46:02.393
It's a pretty fixed program.

46:03.756 --> 46:06.682
Did you add anything and take anything away from it?

46:06.742 --> 46:08.586
You had your shot, had your opportunity?

46:09.268 --> 46:11.753
Well, the faculty, I guess, has their opportunity all the time.

46:11.773 --> 46:15.060
The problem is that things are set up in such a way that

46:16.508 --> 46:24.539
change is difficult, and that's intentional so that we're not blown around by whatever trends are... 120 or so books are prefixed.

46:25.020 --> 46:33.331
Yeah, if, for example, you were to propose that you wanted to add something to the seminar reading list, you would at the same time have to propose what to delete.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.474
So the number, what is the number?

46:35.915 --> 46:45.047
I don't know if there's an absolute number, or if there is, I'm not sure what it might currently be, but in other words, if you want to say, look, let's add...

46:45.297 --> 46:48.260
Let's add Joyce's Ulysses to the senior year.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.502
Well, what are you going to take out?

46:50.862 --> 46:51.162
Tocqueville?

46:51.182 --> 46:54.125
You're going to take out some of Hegel?

46:54.145 --> 47:01.191
You're going to take out some of the American political documents of America?

47:01.211 --> 47:03.073
You're going to take out a lot.

47:04.073 --> 47:05.675
You're just only so much time.

47:05.695 --> 47:13.322
Adding something to the reading list is not easy.

47:13.362 --> 47:14.983
It requires a lot of

47:15.419 --> 47:19.985
persuasion, and it does happen, and certain things get deleted.

47:20.606 --> 47:29.697
The more common kind of change is the year-to-year change where people who maybe caught senior seminar, yeah, I can think of a good change.

47:31.279 --> 47:37.948
We've been talking for some time about whether or not what we do in the sophomore year is really right.

47:38.749 --> 47:41.072
Mainly we used to read

47:43.432 --> 47:52.045
an awful lot, virtually all of the Old Testament and New Testament back-to-back, as though they were one continuous sequence.

47:53.186 --> 48:05.845
After some considerable debate, we decided to not read them back-to-back, but to, there's a break that now occurs, and I forget which sequence goes between the two of them, but people thought that maybe that was a better way to

48:06.854 --> 48:09.237
You haven't added or taken away.

48:09.277 --> 48:13.623
Can you think of any instances where you've added something away and what has the consequences been taken away?

48:14.264 --> 48:19.291
I can't think of a good example.

48:20.012 --> 48:26.721
In recent years, we talked about the great books after.

48:26.741 --> 48:35.734
In recent years, we dropped some of the Marx readings.

48:35.754 --> 48:36.034
We shortened

48:36.757 --> 48:40.964
and added instead some fiction to the senior year.

48:40.984 --> 48:48.055
So that certain things we read in senior year might now come up to Faulkner maybe, or Flannery O'Connor.

48:48.536 --> 48:59.052
Do you have any of those Flannery O'Connor that came in?

48:59.791 --> 49:15.649
I forget exactly what it was, but essentially we added some more recent American fiction to the reading list and dropped some of the rather lengthy block we had of Mark's reading list.

49:15.669 --> 49:17.231
Is it perceived as a canon here?

49:17.691 --> 49:19.373
Are the great books considered a canon?

49:20.875 --> 49:22.236
No.

49:23.318 --> 49:28.043
In fact, I think an interesting take on this again is this.

49:30.554 --> 49:46.352
I think that we think we're a liberal arts college, and our goal is to inculcate the skills that come from the liberating art, the ability to think and to solve problems, and that sort of thing.

49:46.372 --> 49:53.521
And if you push people, they would say that, well, you could accomplish those things with a different set of books.

49:54.602 --> 49:59.768
But the books we chose, because we are, for better and worse,

49:59.950 --> 50:06.136
We live in a world that is largely dominated by the Western tradition.

50:06.276 --> 50:16.607
It makes some sense to have a familiarity with the foundations of your own culture as a starting point for learning things about other cultures.

50:16.627 --> 50:18.209
It's also just practical.

50:18.229 --> 50:24.515
We've bitten off a lot, as it is, but what we've bitten off is all the different parts are related to one another.

50:24.535 --> 50:27.358
Things build on one another.

50:28.064 --> 50:44.083
accretion of knowledge and richness as you read through the sequence of readings over the four years that you wouldn't get if you were just randomly selecting some here, and then, oh, let's read a few books from the Eastern tradition over here, and then maybe some of this.

50:44.684 --> 50:48.328
It's meant to build on one another and have a kind of coherence.

50:49.029 --> 50:57.058
But no, I think people would say right away, in fact, people would say right away, we do not read the great books.

50:57.663 --> 51:13.692
What we claim is that all the books we read are in fact great by certain kinds of standards and are worth reading, but we adequately deny that our list is the great books.

51:14.434 --> 51:20.204
We readily acknowledge there are many great works we don't read.

51:20.224 --> 51:20.565
That's important.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.283
Yeah, I think that that is important.

51:23.303 --> 51:25.025
Again, that's why I talk to counselors and others.

51:25.045 --> 51:30.734
It's something I try to get people to see that we're not claiming that this list is definitive in some way.

51:31.836 --> 51:33.578
It suits our purposes.

51:34.239 --> 51:40.629
It suits our purposes, and we would defend our choices if these books are well worth reading.

51:41.410 --> 51:44.915
But they're not going to exclusive to the point of view.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.398
I think we're going to wrap up pretty soon.

51:46.498 --> 51:47.860
Is there a poster that you have?

51:47.880 --> 51:48.881
Yeah, somebody did that.

51:49.142 --> 51:49.682
That's beautiful.

51:49.703 --> 51:50.704
We'll take a picture of that.

51:51.342 --> 52:01.472
Would you say that this is not for everyone?

52:02.453 --> 52:04.695
Yeah, it's not for everyone.

52:07.598 --> 52:09.600
You have to be somebody who's interested.

52:10.061 --> 52:16.527
You have to be committed to, as I said earlier, talking with other people in class about issues that are important.

52:16.707 --> 52:20.691
That means you have to be willing not only to say what you think,

52:20.857 --> 52:28.507
but to have a challenge by other people to be able to refine your positions and to be tolerant of people who disagree with you.

52:28.527 --> 52:48.052
In other words, the group effort isn't to arrive... In seminar, for example, the group effort isn't really to arrive at an answer to the opening question, but to articulate as clearly as we can for ourselves some of the possible answers or approaches to that question.

52:48.072 --> 52:49.294
So you've got to be satisfied

52:50.405 --> 53:20.344
you've got to be willing to do the talking and participate in exchange you've also got to be the kind of person who's satisfied uh to stay in limbo because when the seminar is over the the two tutors aren't going to say well those of you who thought x actually have the right answer and the rest of you are wrong now we know what the answer is we get all those things you're going to remain in limbo it's up for you it's up to you to decide the theological texts that we read i think they're interesting to say

53:20.932 --> 53:33.323
We ask people to take seriously reading something like the Old Testament or the New Testament and to really talk about it and face the claims that are made.

53:33.443 --> 53:37.988
But at the end of the day, it's up to you to decide what you believe.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.530
And then just one final factual question.

53:41.571 --> 53:42.872
How large is the student body?

53:43.573 --> 53:49.538
We're a little over 430 students on this campus right now.

53:49.737 --> 53:52.821
fairly evenly divided among classes?

53:54.424 --> 54:00.893
At present, I want to say that we have something like 100 seniors.

54:02.275 --> 54:09.585
I don't know what a freshman class of, a total freshman class of, maybe 100 years.

54:11.337 --> 54:14.563
And how many apply in a given year?

54:14.863 --> 54:24.601
In a given year, we'll have about between 350 and 400 students apply for what is a freshman class of about 108 to 120.

54:24.781 --> 54:26.785
And how many do you admit?

54:27.306 --> 54:33.497
We'll usually admit 70% or more of those 80% in a given year.

54:34.304 --> 54:36.087
Our yield off, that will be quite high.

54:36.127 --> 54:42.498
About 60% will eventually enroll in college on one of its two campuses and one of the two freshman classes.

54:42.518 --> 54:43.961
So it's 430 here.

54:44.321 --> 54:50.071
Yeah, about 400 in San Francisco, a little bit smaller.

54:50.091 --> 54:50.632
So it's about 800 students.

54:50.652 --> 54:54.358
Yeah, it's really a college of 800 students, half of them in one other place.

54:54.438 --> 54:57.724
Evenly divided between men and women or approximately?

54:58.505 --> 55:00.008
I'd say, my guess would be about 300.

55:00.427 --> 55:05.102
that the overall student body reflects the freshman class, which is typically 60% male.

55:07.409 --> 55:13.609
That won't tax your voice anymore.
