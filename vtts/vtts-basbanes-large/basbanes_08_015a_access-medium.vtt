WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:06.682
I am in French and in Spanish.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.864
You can read one of those languages?

00:10.346 --> 00:12.088
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

00:12.328 --> 00:13.629
French I can read a little bit.

00:13.649 --> 00:14.671
I can read in French.

00:14.691 --> 00:26.764
Because it was a small book in which I told the story of the first edition of Amphitheatrum Sapientia Eterna by Kunrat, edition Hanau, 1609.

00:27.166 --> 00:34.079
That was a very tortured story, and so I made the story of all the existing copies as a sort of detection.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.622
What's the title of the book again?

00:36.504 --> 00:46.423
Amphitheatrum Sapientia Eternis, a Kabbalistic book of the early 17th century.

00:46.792 --> 01:09.033
which has a very complicated story, and nobody's able to say what the standard copy should be, the number of engravings, and it happened to me to have an incomplete copy, then to find the lacking engravings, and so to set up a good copy for practically nothing right now, it's very expensive.

01:09.053 --> 01:16.140
So once, in order to please a friend who has a magazine on Bible Bibliote,

01:16.508 --> 01:19.252
bibliography and bibliophilia.

01:19.272 --> 01:28.307
I wrote that story that one was printed as a booklet out of, was given free for, I don't remember which occasion.

01:28.327 --> 01:33.415
Well, I'll try and get it because I'm updating the bibliography on this.

01:33.936 --> 01:35.038
Give me your address.

01:35.058 --> 01:38.263
I sent certainly the Italian edition.

01:38.547 --> 01:41.253
because I have many, many copies left of it.

01:41.273 --> 01:42.215
I'll just put this in the book.

01:42.235 --> 01:52.617
Then there is a French translation, which is not so good, but I don't know if still I have a second or third copy.

01:52.637 --> 01:56.285
I think you'll like this, because this is a celebration of books through the centuries.

01:56.305 --> 01:58.530
I start in Alexandria, and I...

01:58.966 --> 02:01.090
But is it through the ages?

02:01.531 --> 02:07.262
Yes, I started in Alexandria and part one is history and part two is journalism.

02:07.323 --> 02:14.356
You are also speaking of that incredible character who was Guglielmo Libri.

02:14.376 --> 02:17.683
Yes, Libri is in here, but the booksy Bloomberg is in here.

02:18.102 --> 02:23.748
Because I am fascinated by Guglielmo Libri, and I have also some, yes.

02:23.948 --> 02:25.249
You'll love this fellow here.

02:25.269 --> 02:26.571
Let me just show you the photographs.

02:26.591 --> 02:30.334
I have some of the tracks that were written at the time of the trial.

02:32.296 --> 02:38.222
This fellow here is the big book thief of the 20th century, this Blumberg, who I went to his trial.

02:38.282 --> 02:41.746
He stole 27,000 books from 350 libraries.

02:42.267 --> 02:45.730
I took these pictures of him in his empty house, which was empty of all books.

02:46.182 --> 02:49.185
And I have an interview with him in here, and I went to his trial.

02:49.846 --> 02:50.787
It's a fun chapter.

02:51.128 --> 02:53.290
I think you'll enjoy it.

02:53.430 --> 02:59.718
I have reading material for my intercontinental return.

02:59.818 --> 03:13.894
And I have the name of the rose in chapter one, of course, because my first chapter, I talk about the literature of books, and, of course, that whole novel turns on a book, on the theft of a book, which is awesome.

03:14.161 --> 03:29.606
I have to tell you, also, I'm a former naval officer who was on a ship in the Pacific back in the 60s, and I remember when we crossed the international date line, this was a very big moment, you know, when we went... Yes, this is a very big moment.

03:29.746 --> 03:40.624
You know that the sailors of Magellan, when they went back to Spain, they were convinced it was, let's say, Thursday, and they discovered it was Friday.

03:41.127 --> 03:48.417
And they didn't understand why that happened, because they kept the track of every day in the journals.

03:48.998 --> 03:58.590
And so they believed that since they didn't observe the Friday penitence, God punished them, stealing them the day.

04:00.052 --> 04:02.195
Did you start with that concept?

04:02.215 --> 04:02.416
No.

04:03.357 --> 04:05.039
No, it came a little later.

04:05.059 --> 04:09.345
My first, I never start from a concept, but from an image.

04:10.066 --> 04:10.206
Mm-hmm.

04:10.287 --> 04:25.364
So my first image was that one of the shipwrecked upon a desert ship with the island in face and the impossibility to reach it in terms of space.

04:25.384 --> 04:27.148
Then it happened to me.

04:27.517 --> 04:52.225
to buy not this one but another wristwatch of this kind with the world with the world time okay you see with the brightness no no with the world time well not the world time but it's a 24 hour and so you see the greenwich mean sign yes yes and there is also the date line ah and in a setting setting up the the watch i have

04:52.492 --> 05:05.448
to reflect upon the dateline, that is something that we know, we knew it at school or reading Hulverne, and they said, oh, it would be beautiful to put between the island and the ship, the dateline.

05:05.488 --> 05:09.493
So I complicated space with time.

05:10.134 --> 05:17.082
At that point, I went to the Atlas to see where the dateline today passed through,

05:17.483 --> 05:21.127
And first I discovered the Aleutinian Islands.

05:21.147 --> 05:25.951
Very cold, I said, I cannot tell a story about the Aleutinians.

05:25.971 --> 05:26.652
Aleutians.

05:26.712 --> 05:28.374
Aleutians, yes, south of Alaska.

05:28.914 --> 05:30.676
But then I discovered the Fiji Islands.

05:30.856 --> 05:32.778
Okay, Fiji, that's better.

05:33.238 --> 05:35.140
From Stevenson to Conrad.

05:35.381 --> 05:40.766
And then since I, in my childhood, I was a stamp collector.

05:40.886 --> 05:45.010
I remember the Fiji stamps that were beautiful.

05:45.361 --> 05:55.859
Then I saw that the Fiji were probably not discovered but touched by Tasman, more or less at the time of my Nobel.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.147
Then I came across the story of longitudes, that was a real discovery.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.168
That's a wonderful story.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.551
A real discovery for me.

06:02.611 --> 06:06.658
And then I decided to set it in the 17th century.

06:06.758 --> 06:10.204
Only at this moment, yes, when I discovered the story

06:10.623 --> 06:15.251
of longitudes, I was really excited because I didn't know it.

06:15.912 --> 06:18.817
Coincidentally, there's a book out right now about longitudes.

06:18.837 --> 06:19.538
Have you seen that?

06:19.578 --> 06:22.623
Just about, in fact, it was reviewed last week in the New York Times.

06:22.643 --> 06:25.869
No, I've not seen it, but there are some of them.

06:25.929 --> 06:35.385
I remember that eight, you know... What about the search to... Yes, there are others, because I remember that I was just looking around for longitudes.

06:35.485 --> 06:36.867
I was at the stand,

06:37.336 --> 06:44.783
Strand book store in New York, the upper level where Craig Anderson says this.

06:44.863 --> 06:51.589
And I asked Craig, could you find me an interesting book on the story of time and longitude?

06:51.609 --> 06:54.091
And in two weeks he found me the first book.

06:54.111 --> 06:55.512
Then I found another one.

06:56.073 --> 07:00.257
And I'm, well, if you send me the clip of that.

07:00.797 --> 07:04.861
Now I don't need it any longer, but for my shelves.

07:05.201 --> 07:06.162
Yes.

07:06.749 --> 07:08.971
And it is an extraordinary story.

07:08.992 --> 07:28.413
Then I got also old 17th century books about this Monsieur Morin, I quote in the book, at the Times of Richelieu, I wrote a lot, then Tiffis, Batavousse, then many, many, many other books.

07:29.114 --> 07:36.182
At this point, were you doing research for a novel, or was this a scholarly inquiry for you at this point?

07:36.719 --> 07:44.208
It was for the novel, but at the same time, it excited me as a scholarly researcher.

07:44.408 --> 07:49.814
Certainly, in these cases, I pile up more material than needed by the novel.

07:49.834 --> 07:55.141
That one day or another can be used for other purposes.

07:56.002 --> 08:05.713
I remember when I was writing Foucault's pendulum, I put together so much material about hermeticism that I...

08:06.638 --> 08:15.011
I was afraid to be tempted to put all this on the novel, which is already filled up with, stuffed up with everything.

08:15.452 --> 08:22.884
So I decided to make a course at the university for two years about Hermeticism.

08:23.285 --> 08:33.962
And so, in a way, I threw on the other side all this exceeding material for scholarly research on the late Hellenistic

08:34.448 --> 08:38.232
times to the Renaissance and so on and so forth.

08:38.332 --> 08:50.986
And so I was using the same material for the novel but this excess of scholarly curiosity was displaced on the other side.

08:51.006 --> 08:55.230
How important is storytelling to you when you went into novels?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.292
I think a norm.

08:57.312 --> 08:58.954
I like to tell stories.

09:00.537 --> 09:02.959
I'm a good joke teller.

09:03.099 --> 09:04.741
I like to elaborate.

09:05.261 --> 09:10.585
When my kids were real kids, I told them a lot of stories.

09:11.106 --> 09:12.607
Now they're adults.

09:12.627 --> 09:18.412
So sometimes I say when they ask me, why did you start to write notes?

09:18.432 --> 09:22.055
Probably because my kids were by then adults.

09:22.155 --> 09:27.580
And so I didn't have an audience to tell stories.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.122
I decided to write them.

09:30.322 --> 09:33.786
Well, I notice you've got a couple of children's books, too, as a matter of fact.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.388
I have two of your children's books.

09:35.448 --> 09:36.069
Yes, yes.

09:36.089 --> 09:46.742
I would say, accidentally, because this painter, this friend of mine, wanted to do something together, because if you look, my text is three pages altogether.

09:47.964 --> 09:50.727
Then, no, it was at the time of...

09:51.230 --> 09:59.585
the first anti-atomic movement, and so we decided to make children's books about the bone, the atomic bone.

09:59.605 --> 10:04.674
It was done for, let's say, for ideological and moral reasons.

10:04.754 --> 10:07.098
Do you like maps?

10:07.619 --> 10:09.723
Yes, I love maps, too.

10:09.823 --> 10:10.805
I can tell you like maps.

10:10.825 --> 10:11.827
I love maps.

10:11.847 --> 10:13.069
One of my

10:13.943 --> 10:43.039
dreams as a collector is to have all the books of Mercato, Orteleus, but they are, you know, these people stole so many pages that is more and more difficult to, a good, complete Orteleus is 250 dollars to find even in the pristine state.

10:43.272 --> 11:02.192
I like them, and I remember when I was a child at school, during the class, probably the professor was saying something else, and with the Atlas, I imagined stories, the kind, I am Napoleon, I am conquering this, and working, traveling on the maps.

11:02.408 --> 11:09.297
If you were me writing for a newspaper audience, and by the way, I read a column that is read in about 20 university cities.

11:09.937 --> 11:19.509
I'm out in Eugene, Oregon, and Salt Lake City, and Charlottesville, Virginia, but largely where you would have a very appreciative audience.

11:19.790 --> 11:27.740
But let's say you were me, and you were writing for a newspaper, and you had to explain what semiotics is.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.682
How would you do it in a simple way?

11:29.780 --> 11:38.948
You know that there was a book entitled How to Travel, and chapter 11 was How to Travel with Children, and the text was Don't.

11:40.009 --> 11:45.213
So how to explain semiotics in a column, don't.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.775
I am a columnist by side.

11:47.855 --> 11:56.062
But I guess I'm trying to make the leap from your professional... Okay, we are in few words.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.145
We are communicating animals, okay?

11:59.665 --> 12:16.482
We are communicating through language, certainly, but even through gestures, paintings, even through this moment, the furniture and the interior decoration of this hotel is communicating you sometimes.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.725
Luxury.

12:17.941 --> 12:19.163
prestige.

12:19.964 --> 12:26.133
You can detect from the interior decoration the price of the room in a way.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.399
All that is a semiosis.

12:30.699 --> 12:38.611
This activity by which we use something present, a word, an image, an object, in order to tell you something which is not there.

12:39.252 --> 12:40.053
Okay.

12:40.073 --> 12:44.860
That is the human ability to live

12:45.076 --> 12:49.282
outside and beyond the crude presence of fact.

12:49.543 --> 12:56.112
While you can say that a dog following with its smell the track of an animal is following the presence.

12:57.374 --> 13:03.844
Then I add, and we had just a discussion two days ago in Toronto with

13:04.702 --> 13:23.189
Some of my colleagues, some of them, assume that there are processes of communication among animals and not only, among genes, among lymphocytes, internal... And in a way, it's possible to find reduced models of communication at that level.

13:23.330 --> 13:31.582
I'm not so interested at that level because I don't know personally lymphocytes, why I know personally human beings.

13:31.762 --> 13:34.506
But let's say...

13:34.638 --> 13:44.349
Semiotics is interested with all those devices we use in our everyday life to make something present, which is not there.

13:44.509 --> 13:50.576
We can speak of God, of my mother, of Ireland, and they are not here.

13:52.498 --> 14:00.527
We can do it through words, through math, through a photograph, our common human activity,

14:01.030 --> 14:06.177
to go continuously beyond the limits of the crude physical presence.

14:06.537 --> 14:21.618
Semiotics is interested in all of this and trying to see if there is a unified set of intellectual instruments in order to analyze all those phenomena.

14:21.838 --> 14:24.341
So it is interested with cognition.

14:24.361 --> 14:26.464
Today, semiotics is interfering

14:26.815 --> 14:34.843
with researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, with so-called cognitive studies.

14:35.924 --> 14:42.310
We have frequently meetings with neurologists, psychologists.

14:42.330 --> 14:54.882
So when you came at the age, I guess, of 50 to write a novel, did you bring this wealth of knowledge of symbiotics to the task, or was it really kind of an adventure for you?

14:55.418 --> 15:15.345
No, I think everybody who starts to write a novel or a poem, irrespectively whether he or she does it at the age of 20 or the age of 80, brings inside it his or her own entire experience.

15:15.586 --> 15:16.587
Okay.

15:16.607 --> 15:18.169
I wouldn't say that I

15:18.740 --> 15:24.467
paid attention or I planned a way to put into the book my previous knowledge.

15:24.547 --> 15:25.007
No.

15:25.027 --> 15:27.190
Otherwise, I would have written another scholarly book.

15:27.690 --> 15:29.012
It was an act of freedom.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.194
I want to narrate a story.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.155
Okay.

15:32.175 --> 15:34.238
Probably some of my previous experience.

15:34.258 --> 15:35.920
Freedom or liberation.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.261
Freedom or liberation.

15:37.281 --> 15:38.322
Oh, liberation.

15:38.983 --> 15:42.347
I am not obliged to demonstrate something.

15:42.627 --> 15:42.928
No, no.

15:43.028 --> 15:43.228
It was

15:43.698 --> 15:47.683
Was it an expression of independence on your part?

15:47.704 --> 15:48.505
Yes, probably.

15:48.525 --> 15:59.420
And I had been requested, asked a few days ago in New York, you are working scholarly milieu in the university and you are a nominee.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.444
Who is the wife and who is the mistress?

16:02.804 --> 16:09.433
I said, well, certainly, university and the scholarly work is the wife, because I come back every day to tutor.

16:09.954 --> 16:11.376
And so...

16:11.592 --> 16:38.089
novel were an adultery experience which gives you a lot of a sense of freedom and i guess a degree of satisfaction as well yes i i enjoy it but yes the real experience is the process of writing that's why uh the pendulum took me eight years the island is six years i i will

16:38.474 --> 16:39.955
I wouldn't like to finish.

16:40.016 --> 16:47.263
I tried desperately to postpone the moment in which the book is finished because the real pleasure is going on.

16:47.443 --> 16:50.746
Now, this became a film, see, I love this.

16:51.147 --> 16:51.407
Yes.

16:51.727 --> 16:52.708
And it was not a bad film.

16:53.249 --> 16:53.849
It wasn't bad.

16:54.049 --> 16:54.630
Did you like it?

16:54.650 --> 16:55.431
No, no, no.

16:55.451 --> 17:05.781
Once you accept the idea that the film is another interpretation of your book, not a translation or transliteration, it's not

17:06.115 --> 17:32.528
like to to to transliterate from latin alphabet to cyrillic alphabet is an interpretation is another person who looks at your book selects some layers and makes up his own work once you accepted this perspective and you are not not so dogmatic or fundamentalist for for asking a point to point

17:32.609 --> 17:41.742
faithful correspondents, okay, then you can recognize the film itself as another work of art and you can appreciate it.

17:41.762 --> 17:45.587
But you wouldn't allow them to do a film of Foucault's pendulum?

17:45.607 --> 17:45.827
No.

17:46.949 --> 17:47.950
For two reasons.

17:48.951 --> 17:58.184
One is that what disturbed me in The Name of the Rose as a movie was that many, many people read the book after the movie.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.287
This is a

18:00.706 --> 18:05.132
You have another person who filters the reading of your readers.

18:05.572 --> 18:07.615
So the movie came too early.

18:08.476 --> 18:11.880
And so for the Foucault's Pendulum I said, first of all, no, not now.

18:12.281 --> 18:14.263
Let's see, in 10 years or 15 years.

18:15.185 --> 18:23.095
Second, because there are certain fundamental elements in the Foucault's Pendulum that I wanted to keep under control.

18:23.115 --> 18:28.722
And these would have requested that I work with them for two, three years and I...

18:29.242 --> 18:30.003
That wasn't possible.

18:30.023 --> 18:30.964
It wasn't possible.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.247
So I prefer to freeze it.

18:33.648 --> 18:40.196
I think the new novel, though, lends itself more, perhaps, to a visual.

18:40.256 --> 18:43.680
Yes, it is eminently visual.

18:43.840 --> 18:55.715
So it would be easier to do, probably, than Foucault's personal because you have a lot of visual experience plus flashbacks which are cinematically possible.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.898
But I could be tempted

18:58.081 --> 19:05.491
to work as an advisor for six months in Tahiti.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.713
Especially in the wintertime.

19:06.733 --> 19:07.955
I would be tempted.

19:10.058 --> 19:14.364
I'm not going to ask you specific questions about the novels, because that's my job, to read them.

19:14.424 --> 19:19.992
And if you don't mind, I mean, it's... You will make your own review.

19:20.072 --> 19:21.133
Yes, yes.

19:21.193 --> 19:27.362
I would just assume, as we're talking now, if that's okay, but occasionally I'll ask you a few questions.

19:28.388 --> 19:30.451
before I got lost here.

19:32.093 --> 19:35.778
When you wrote The Name of the Rose, I think the first printing in the United States, I remember it.

19:36.078 --> 19:40.104
I was one of the very first persons to read it, I remember, because I was a book reviewer.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.486
I was shocked.

19:41.506 --> 19:42.848
I said, what is this book?

19:42.868 --> 19:43.689
You know, I loved it.

19:44.750 --> 19:49.877
And I remember the New York Times did a review of it on the front page, and it took off.

19:50.017 --> 19:50.618
It went crazy.

19:50.698 --> 19:54.223
I mean, I think the first printing was about 10,000 copies or something like that.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.164
Four.

19:55.445 --> 19:55.926
Four thousand.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.286
No, I...

19:56.502 --> 20:09.376
Well, I am not giving you something exceptionally unearthed off, but the story was the following, that Helen Wolf, Helen Kurt Wolf's book, a great publisher.

20:09.396 --> 20:12.960
I met her in New York.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.782
She had read a book in Italian.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.867
At that time, the book was still in auction at Farah Strauss.

20:18.947 --> 20:19.928
I don't remember that.

20:20.262 --> 20:25.991
No, I remember that every time I meet Roger Strauss, he says, ah, my God.

20:26.011 --> 20:26.371
I love that.

20:27.793 --> 20:27.894
Okay.

20:27.914 --> 20:36.146
And Helen said, I love this book, but you understand, Humberto, in America, speaking of cathedrals, abbeys, things that they have.

20:36.847 --> 20:40.072
In Europe, they see them every day, but in America.

20:40.893 --> 20:45.460
So we can hope to make 3,000 copies, not more.

20:46.165 --> 20:56.477
And so if you accept an advance upon 3,000 copies, that was, I thought it would be better, 2,000, 3,000 dollars, I go.

20:57.018 --> 20:58.679
And I said, yes, okay.

20:58.699 --> 21:00.582
I'm so happy that you like the book.

21:01.002 --> 21:06.929
The Kurt and Dan Wolf series was a great and prestigious series.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.915
I was ready to pay myself to have the book in that series.

21:11.935 --> 21:14.298
I said, okay, okay, not a matter of money.

21:14.318 --> 21:14.738
Go.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.106
So the first idea was that it was a 3,000-copy book.

21:20.887 --> 21:38.970
Then they certainly printed a little more, because at that time there had already been the French and the German success, so they got the idea that probably it could... Okay, that was the...

21:39.153 --> 21:42.536
the first forecast.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.480
Were you surprised by the reception of this book?

21:46.520 --> 21:50.003
You said you wrote this as an exercise, as an act of liberation.

21:50.164 --> 22:08.181
As an act of liberation, and I thought that in Italy, being well known as an author, I said probably there will be a lot of people who have read my previous books that for mere curiosity will, so I can make 10,000 copies.

22:08.617 --> 22:12.560
But the response, was that a shock to you?

22:12.921 --> 22:13.521
Yes, it was.

22:13.802 --> 22:15.803
Because it is an intellectual novel.

22:15.823 --> 22:28.134
You know, obviously every writer, when writing, nurtures the hope that this book will become the divine comedy and make millions and millions of copies.

22:28.154 --> 22:36.041
But this is the same way in which, I don't know, you swim and you hope to become Weissmüller.

22:36.281 --> 22:37.362
Okay.

22:37.903 --> 22:38.303
So then.

22:38.705 --> 23:07.277
see yes it was a a surprise and what is curious is that i learned a certain expression in different languages that expression was in italian boca boca in french in english word of mouth in german in every country yes there were good reviews that started probably

23:07.527 --> 23:16.859
the process, but every book seller said it's a book sold because of word of mouth.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.582
A reader telling another reader, telling another reader.

23:20.123 --> 23:24.108
So it took off not so quickly.

23:24.949 --> 23:28.974
It was not like this.

23:28.994 --> 23:32.519
My book is going into its fourth printing.

23:32.539 --> 23:35.002
And it's only had one advertisement so far.

23:35.362 --> 23:35.823
Just one.

23:35.923 --> 23:37.365
And the New York Review of Books

23:37.514 --> 23:38.576
It's been out for three months.

23:38.836 --> 23:42.321
It was 6,700, first printing, and now it's up to 35,000.

23:42.742 --> 23:45.566
Word of mouth is the best.

23:45.726 --> 23:48.190
I worked for 17 years in the publishing house.

23:48.390 --> 23:49.331
I am an author.

23:50.032 --> 23:58.024
I am a reviewer, but I know that the reviews count until a few hundred copies.

23:58.445 --> 24:00.969
Advertising?

24:02.010 --> 24:03.252
Okay, certainly.

24:03.535 --> 24:10.025
If for two months you buy a whole page of the New York Times, you can do that.

24:10.045 --> 24:12.069
They are book sellers.

24:12.089 --> 24:22.585
If they believe in you, they make your book to... If they don't like you and... I always repeat it.

24:22.726 --> 24:27.453
I am a... I am a... Beneficado.

24:27.513 --> 24:29.256
Yes, I was...

24:29.590 --> 24:33.076
I owe everything to the booksellers.

24:33.116 --> 24:37.845
They were the Smith of my fate.

24:38.165 --> 24:43.936
You mentioned that you don't start a novel with a concept or a character even, but with an image.

24:44.457 --> 24:46.941
So what was the image that you started with?

24:47.258 --> 24:48.520
or the name of the rose?

24:51.424 --> 24:59.956
Yes, I wrote in reflection of the name of the rose that I wanted to poison a monk, and this statement has been taken literally.

25:00.177 --> 25:04.743
I didn't want to poison any monk, but I started with the image of a poisoned monk.

25:04.763 --> 25:05.745
Oh really?

25:05.765 --> 25:12.895
Yes, the image that in my youth, at the age of 20,

25:13.567 --> 25:19.155
When I was still a fervent Catholic, I made a spiritual exercise.

25:19.996 --> 25:24.342
You gather in a place for three or four days, meditation.

25:24.482 --> 25:36.739
And it was in the beautiful Benedictine monastery of Subiaco, Santa Scholastica, which has three cloister, a Gothic one,

25:37.327 --> 25:41.271
A Roman one, a Gothic one and a Renaissance one.

25:41.991 --> 25:44.053
I was fascinated by that place.

25:44.073 --> 25:45.214
And there was a library.

25:45.935 --> 25:49.018
There was a library with a big lectern.

25:50.058 --> 25:57.565
And I spent some hours in this library looking at the Acta Sanctorum and all those.

25:57.585 --> 26:06.253
And that image was always present in my mind because it was the first and last time I lived for four days in a monastery.

26:07.837 --> 26:18.049
And when I started the first idea, I had immediately this idea of the monk reading and at a certain point being murdered there.

26:19.050 --> 26:28.460
Probably because the great tradition of detection stories comes under the ending of murder in the vicarage.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.545
Vicarages are... Since I couldn't

26:32.997 --> 26:38.104
choose the Butler solution framework.

26:38.184 --> 26:42.329
I thought it might have been the text, the last text of Aristotle.

26:45.113 --> 26:48.998
Yes, but I have written another story.

26:50.220 --> 26:55.427
Well, the story of the text of Aristotle came step by step.

26:57.730 --> 26:58.431
But then,

26:59.204 --> 27:03.811
You know, I am a rare book collector only since 15 years.

27:04.232 --> 27:10.842
Because I didn't buy, probably just because of the name of the rose, I went in touch with a lot of librarians.

27:11.042 --> 27:12.144
I had some more money.

27:12.825 --> 27:15.029
So you didn't collect before you opened the rose?

27:15.049 --> 27:21.879
No, not occasionally very cheap books that I found in the book in East, let's say.

27:21.899 --> 27:22.701
So nothing.

27:22.721 --> 27:23.642
Exactly.

27:24.027 --> 27:28.373
So after having written The Name of the Road, I became a regular book collector.

27:28.453 --> 27:40.590
So for every book, I write down a file with all the description, short of margin, water stained, wormholes, rocks, etc.

27:41.652 --> 27:46.659
And one day, by now, I have 30,000 books in my home.

27:46.719 --> 27:47.860
Not all books.

27:48.581 --> 27:53.308
But at that time, they were not 30,000, but probably 20 or 25.

27:53.896 --> 28:07.460
So during, when I moved over there, looking at the upper shafts, I found a 16th century edition Italian translation of the Poetics of Aristotle.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.422
I didn't know to have it.

28:09.143 --> 28:15.955
I opened it, and here it was written in pencil 1,000, which means 1,000 liars, so 70 cents.

28:16.812 --> 28:23.842
So probably 20 years before I found this book in 70 cents, even at that time.

28:24.342 --> 28:25.924
It was like $3 today.

28:26.245 --> 28:27.807
And I bought it.

28:29.149 --> 28:33.475
And then I decided to make up the files for this book.

28:33.575 --> 28:34.917
I looked in the catalogs.

28:34.937 --> 28:37.660
It was the second edition, translated by Riccoboni.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.903
I started writing down the title.

28:40.284 --> 28:43.749
And in the second part, it was a use them as comica.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.212
This Riccoboni was, in the last part of the book,

28:46.428 --> 28:58.548
trying to reconstruct the second book of Aristotle's Poetics, which was not so extraordinary because during the century many tried to reconstruct it.

28:58.568 --> 28:59.910
Okay, that's curious.

29:01.272 --> 29:02.935
Then I started describing the book

29:03.590 --> 29:29.293
and at the beginning of the second part i was obliged to say water stain exaggerated the soil the inferior margins are cropped and and at the end they are passed together that it was exactly the manuscript of my book i had it there it was not the manuscript it was a printed book but in the same physical

29:29.510 --> 29:36.261
Really, it was disgusting to open the last pages as if they were poisoned.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.467
So it means that I bought this book for $70.

29:39.487 --> 29:40.027
70 cents.

29:40.448 --> 29:41.530
70 cents.

29:41.650 --> 29:50.585
I realized that it was too soiled and unpleasant to touch and I put it there.

29:50.986 --> 29:54.792
But probably, I photographed it.

29:55.750 --> 30:06.389
And 20 years later I believed to have invented a manuscript and instead I was describing that book.

30:06.409 --> 30:07.691
That's wonderful.

30:08.192 --> 30:10.757
That's a wonderful story.

30:11.117 --> 30:12.139
I had a book there.

30:12.620 --> 30:16.106
Now you're a collector and you're a scholar.

30:17.489 --> 30:20.374
Do you love these books as objects as well as

30:20.590 --> 30:21.652
Both.

30:21.672 --> 30:29.364
I am not one of those collectors that don't open the books in order not to destroy them.

30:29.484 --> 30:32.288
When I need, I open them and I do.

30:33.050 --> 30:39.500
Sometimes there are sort of copies that I love just because of the copy, of the beauty of the copy.

30:39.540 --> 30:42.344
Recently I bought them in Cunabulum, St.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.349
Augustine, in the Trinitate and Civitate Dei.

30:45.852 --> 31:14.796
which is not so rare, and it wasn't so incredibly expensive, rubricated from the beginning to the end, and also the typography is incredible, because in the center there is the text, in the margins the commentary, but according to the length of the commentary the text changes in size, so it's also the lettering,

31:15.265 --> 31:39.366
the paper is so crazy in this case i love the copy because the text i can have it more than a more than a critical edition in this case it is the copy in other cases with several books i had to consult for for my note it was also the text and so i but i mean do you get a physical

31:39.903 --> 31:42.207
You feel something when you handle a beautiful book.

31:42.367 --> 31:49.479
Yes, otherwise you don't become a collector, touching them.

31:49.499 --> 31:52.565
There are some books that I like to touch.

31:52.585 --> 31:57.573
I read some place, I think in the New York Times, that moving has become a problem for you because of all the books.

31:59.236 --> 31:59.617
Yes.

31:59.657 --> 32:01.921
Moving from one apartment to another.

32:01.981 --> 32:03.784
It didn't happen only to me.

32:04.051 --> 32:10.618
I know several friends that had to move because the walls were collapsing.

32:10.638 --> 32:20.529
Now I think to have reached the final point is a big apartment that was formerly a hotel, so there are many corridors.

32:20.870 --> 32:23.292
And corridors are beautiful to shelf.

32:23.953 --> 32:26.155
And so there are 30,000 books.

32:26.356 --> 32:31.341
But now the rule is for every new book entering, one has to...

32:31.625 --> 32:32.946
Who has to leave?

32:32.966 --> 32:39.834
To leave, to go in the countryside and all the places, because over 30 is impossible.

32:39.854 --> 32:40.795
How do you make the choice?

32:42.997 --> 32:44.559
That is the real problem.

32:44.579 --> 32:45.039
Is it hard?

32:45.620 --> 32:46.081
Sometimes.

32:46.241 --> 32:46.941
Are they friends?

32:46.962 --> 32:58.594
I mean, do you feel like they're... No, but since I have an apartment in Bologna where I teach, I can decide, okay, there are two editions, so one is the original, the other is the translation, I bring the translation.

32:58.777 --> 33:03.224
to Bologna because maybe it's more useful for reading to the students.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.429
I make decisions of this kind.

33:07.010 --> 33:17.005
But sometimes I decide sometimes to move the ones I had forgot.

33:17.170 --> 33:20.495
If I didn't remember they were there, so it's useless they are there.

33:21.176 --> 33:25.942
But sometimes the forgotten one is the most important for the moment.

33:25.982 --> 33:28.225
You need a special disposal.

33:28.546 --> 33:34.214
Winston Churchill, I quote him in this book, he said he had 50,000 books, and somebody said, well, do you read them?

33:34.234 --> 33:35.516
Well, that's a ridiculous question.

33:35.536 --> 33:38.840
He said, well, of course it's not necessary to read all the books.

33:38.920 --> 33:43.907
He said, what's important is to know what you have and where it is and how to find it when you need it.

33:44.008 --> 33:45.189
And that's exactly right.

33:45.209 --> 33:45.810
When you need it,

33:46.094 --> 33:49.238
And if you don't have it, it can be the end.

33:49.678 --> 33:51.300
No, then there is another phenomenon.

33:52.822 --> 33:57.027
At first, to glance, it's inexplicable.

33:58.108 --> 34:02.493
That you have a book since 20 years.

34:03.895 --> 34:05.757
You know you have never read it.

34:06.898 --> 34:13.806
But when once you need it, and you pick it up, and you open it,

34:14.107 --> 34:44.046
you understand that you knew everything about that book so first explanation is that there is some mysterious magnetic force by which having touched so many times this book you have sucked up the real explanation is that it is not true that you have never read it picking in the top and moving it several times you have opened it then in the meanwhile you have read other books that were speaking about the same

34:44.262 --> 34:46.345
subjects or speaking about that book.

34:46.365 --> 34:48.528
So in the end you realize you knew it.

34:48.748 --> 34:49.169
You knew it.

34:49.209 --> 34:51.392
But it's a beautiful experience.

34:51.532 --> 34:53.895
It happens to me all the time.

34:54.276 --> 35:02.087
I've gotten rid of books and cursed myself a week later because I needed it, you know, after having it for 20 years or something like that.

35:02.107 --> 35:02.868
What do you expect?

35:03.308 --> 35:04.750
I guess this is two questions.

35:04.831 --> 35:09.357
I guess do you have a vision of who reads your books, number one, and what do you expect?

35:09.477 --> 35:11.620
Do you have expectations from your readers?

35:11.785 --> 35:28.769
I don't know if you are familiar with certain of my semiotic text, some narrativity in which I elaborate upon the idea of modern or ideal reader.

35:30.612 --> 35:37.962
You don't write for an existing target, except you are writing on cooking

35:38.245 --> 35:45.072
or sex for housewives, for soccer, cooking.

35:46.674 --> 35:51.439
But if not, in a book you are building up your reader.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.382
You are designing a possible reader.

35:55.103 --> 36:00.749
And then the real modern reader is the one who plays your game.

36:01.750 --> 36:06.295
And you can build up a very flexible

36:06.747 --> 36:30.949
model reader, I mean multileveled, the one who is only multileveled, the one who is only following the story, the one who is picking up certain allusions, the one, and that reader can be the first time a first level reader, the second time a second level reader, but more or less you

36:31.132 --> 36:43.350
And so you realize immediately when somebody asks you a question or writes you a letter, if he or she has become the model reader or not, even with reviewers.

36:45.253 --> 36:54.326
You can read reviews in which you say, oh, he or she didn't play my game, so he remained outside.

36:54.746 --> 36:59.333
But sometimes every negative review can reveal you that

36:59.650 --> 37:01.994
he or she read the book the right way.

37:02.214 --> 37:05.539
He became the kind of reader he was.

37:05.579 --> 37:11.188
Simply, at a certain point, he or she refused to play this.

37:12.250 --> 37:17.999
He said it was, it is not my vocation to play this.

37:18.099 --> 37:22.165
I had some nasty review in which I

37:22.347 --> 37:47.562
understood i had captured the reader so much comes to mind no not then we became we became good friends after that what was the motivation for that he was irritated he was everything okay but now the pressure from other sources yeah we met again recently london now now he's so kind with me after the accident because i

37:47.997 --> 37:54.887
After that, I kept going and signing petitions and organizing things.

37:57.251 --> 38:01.998
So when we met in Paris, I said, I'm the bullshit.

38:05.403 --> 38:09.769
I'm thinking of another criticism in Italy.

38:09.918 --> 38:28.737
in which the critic of the coast pendulum identified himself with all these hermetic words and with Mr Allier and only after the half of the book he discovered that that for me was the bad guy and not the good guy

38:29.071 --> 38:37.642
At that point there was an act of rebellion and he refused the book, but he refused the book because in some way he was captured.

38:37.963 --> 38:38.283
Responding.

38:38.463 --> 38:39.505
Responding.

38:39.525 --> 38:52.682
And well, I was sad that the critic was so severe, but in a way I was pleased by this kind of mutual seduction.

38:52.983 --> 39:05.362
I seduced it, but at a certain moment, he felt the sensation to be raped, and so he jumped off the book.

39:05.382 --> 39:06.363
Sally, what's your schedule?

39:06.944 --> 39:08.066
Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt.

39:08.226 --> 39:10.569
I'm just going to go pick up Bill.

39:11.290 --> 39:11.571
Yes.

39:12.833 --> 39:13.514
Okay.

39:13.534 --> 39:13.934
Sorry.

39:14.215 --> 39:14.455
That's okay.

39:14.515 --> 39:15.717
I'm just making sure, please.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.313
What time do you meet him?

39:18.453 --> 39:25.881
At 12.30, there's someone coming, and if you can just keep an eye out for him, and he'll probably see you.

39:25.901 --> 39:27.383
This is Harvey Bloom.

39:27.703 --> 39:29.024
Oh, I know Harvey, yeah.

39:29.044 --> 39:30.946
Okay, well, good, then maybe you'll see him.

39:30.967 --> 39:33.810
Okay, well, he might have liked a few minutes, too.

39:33.890 --> 39:36.913
Oh, maybe we're seeing him right now.

39:36.933 --> 39:37.494
No, that's fine.

39:37.514 --> 39:39.456
We still have about a half hour to go.

39:39.476 --> 39:41.578
Yeah, sorry.

39:41.899 --> 39:42.699
I have you later.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.062
If there's anything left of you.

39:45.042 --> 39:48.271
I seem like you're doing well.

39:48.291 --> 39:53.967
I just wanted to tell you that because I'm going to go late.

39:53.987 --> 39:56.414
So I'm not a target.

39:56.434 --> 39:58.680
I make up my target.

39:58.930 --> 40:10.248
I was approached to have put so much Latin in the name of the rose, that's why I opened the pendulum with a Hebrew quotation.

40:10.969 --> 40:13.814
It was a challenge.

40:13.934 --> 40:15.096
Do you want to play the game?

40:15.116 --> 40:17.560
This time you have to accept me this way.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.602
If not, go.

40:18.902 --> 40:24.972
So fiction is a game for you then, because there are riddles, of course, and you love riddles, so you do see this as a game.

40:25.542 --> 40:28.825
as an invitation to the reader to participate in the game?

40:28.845 --> 40:30.347
Yes, it's a duel with the reader.

40:30.447 --> 40:35.451
I would like to use the term seduction.

40:35.592 --> 40:44.020
My experience as a university professor, I'm accustomed with lecturing.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.781
It's my job.

40:46.782 --> 40:54.790
Every time I start a class with my students, not with a new audience, with my students,

40:55.546 --> 40:57.930
I feel as it were the first time.

40:59.572 --> 41:08.906
I feel that if in the first five minutes I don't really capture them and their attention, I'm lost.

41:09.146 --> 41:11.610
It's the same as writing a story or a newspaper story.

41:11.670 --> 41:12.832
You don't have them in the lead.

41:13.372 --> 41:24.709
And if you can call it again an act of seduction or the theatrical attitude or the most common attitude in

41:24.993 --> 41:28.519
in human interaction.

41:29.641 --> 41:36.592
And this is the way to construct your audience.

41:36.612 --> 41:38.415
And to capture them, of course.

41:38.435 --> 41:40.098
The goal is to capture them.

41:40.118 --> 41:44.265
Yes, to transform them into accomplices.

41:45.287 --> 41:47.130
You mentioned you brought up reviews.

41:47.991 --> 41:51.557
Do you have a thin skin when it comes to bad reviews?

41:52.820 --> 41:55.744
Especially when the critic doesn't understand what you're doing.

41:56.064 --> 42:05.697
Obviously, because everybody, not only others, would be loved and liked by everybody else.

42:05.737 --> 42:11.865
So when you find something who is resisting you, okay, you are not so happy.

42:11.925 --> 42:21.257
But sometimes you can learn something even from bad reviews, and then you know that since you have put your message in the bottle,

42:21.794 --> 42:30.110
It can be received by Mr. X or Mr. Y. Okay, you cannot please everybody.

42:30.130 --> 42:38.065
There are a lot of important books in respect to which I have not the ideal reader, and so I have lost them.

42:38.551 --> 42:39.372
the charm.

42:39.472 --> 42:43.818
I don't know which, but there are many problems.

42:43.838 --> 42:45.741
You talk about putting the message in the bottle.

42:45.761 --> 42:53.031
Of course, in this new book, you have this diary that passes through the generations, and that is preserved, isn't it, into the hands.

42:53.511 --> 42:59.019
It's kind of a theme that I explore, this transmission of material, people who save and preserve things.

42:59.039 --> 43:01.302
Yes, in the paper I called

43:01.720 --> 43:04.183
books, the vegetable memory.

43:04.303 --> 43:10.991
We have a biological memory, we have mineral memory, computers, and the vegetable memory.

43:11.792 --> 43:16.518
And they play the role of the grandfather.

43:17.158 --> 43:28.472
You know, at the Neanderthal time, memory was passed from generation to generation by the old person sitting down out of the cavern.

43:28.492 --> 43:30.394
In the evening they told

43:30.813 --> 43:57.124
myths and stories about it and now and now that that our our grandfather um you mentioned you have 30 000 books and you've written about an island in the pacific uh if you were to go off to that i was i'm thinking of harold bloom who told me he would take his shakespeare and his bible ah yes what would you have you got to make us i don't like i don't like these uh

43:57.509 --> 44:05.457
Again, because I think that according to the stages of your life, you can change.

44:05.497 --> 44:11.423
But I am answering that I will bring with me the New York FOMO.

44:12.485 --> 44:19.612
It has so many names that it's possible to invent marvelous stories about that.

44:19.652 --> 44:20.273
You want this?

44:20.293 --> 44:22.175
Has somebody asked you that before?

44:22.195 --> 44:23.696
That's a very good answer.

44:24.177 --> 44:26.419
That's a very great question.

44:27.175 --> 44:30.019
What's next for you in terms of fiction, I guess?

44:30.159 --> 44:31.021
No, no.

44:31.982 --> 44:33.504
I'm waiting.

44:33.564 --> 44:34.706
Is it an inspiration?

44:34.786 --> 44:37.049
I don't feel pressure.

44:37.089 --> 44:42.918
I repeat, it's really an act of liberation to write an ogle.

44:42.938 --> 44:49.167
I don't need to write it neither for money nor for

44:50.969 --> 45:05.805
for keeping the attention of, ah, I continue my, I mean, my writing pulsion is satisfied in writing my papers, my narrative drives are satisfied by making my classes with my students.

45:06.346 --> 45:09.309
So it has to come, it has to come.

45:09.549 --> 45:13.233
Now, you are a serious scholar, distinguished, respected.

45:14.295 --> 45:17.398
If, on the other hand, a hundred years from now,

45:17.497 --> 45:21.162
people know your name for this book, and not for your scholarship.

45:21.182 --> 45:22.043
Would that surprise you?

45:23.966 --> 45:25.468
Or please you?

45:25.808 --> 45:42.070
It can happen, but I have seen that a small article I wrote about the difference between Mac and Doss, calling Mac a Catholic and Doss Protestant, they were, it was one page and a half, is now everywhere on internet.

45:42.252 --> 45:45.999
Probably in 200 years I will be known.

45:47.462 --> 45:47.903
Who knows?

45:48.804 --> 45:49.205
Who knows?

45:49.586 --> 45:54.054
But if you ask me what I would prefer, really I feel embarrassed.

45:54.074 --> 45:56.038
Why didn't you ask that?

45:56.138 --> 45:57.861
I didn't ask that particular question.

45:58.342 --> 46:00.987
I just asked how you'd respond, how you would feel.

46:01.456 --> 46:07.869
I am ready to accept every possible... It's a delightful dilemma to consider, though, isn't it?

46:08.790 --> 46:12.738
Probably it will depend on the edition.

46:12.858 --> 46:18.028
If it is done in acid-free paper, it will survive, and all the rest will be dust.

46:18.048 --> 46:19.070
When you think of H.G.

46:19.090 --> 46:21.996
Wells, who worked so hard in his...

46:22.398 --> 46:23.880
and his non-fiction.

46:24.401 --> 46:26.744
And what's he remembered for us?

46:26.764 --> 46:31.310
Oh yes, but in Italy we have the great example of Petrarch.

46:31.650 --> 46:32.311
Of course.

46:32.331 --> 46:44.627
Petrarch was spending his life in order to write his great Latin poem, Africa, and his sonnets were a marginal amusement.

46:44.747 --> 46:49.333
That's the perfect example.

46:49.904 --> 46:52.027
I won't take up too much more of your time.

46:54.209 --> 46:55.491
You do write about obsession.

46:55.531 --> 46:57.753
Do you have any obsessions of your own?

47:00.837 --> 47:08.486
You know, I think that the first quality of an obsessed person is not to know he is obsessed.

47:10.489 --> 47:11.790
Probably I have obsessions.

47:14.493 --> 47:14.674
Probably.

47:14.694 --> 47:19.219
Once my mentor, when I was still a young student,

47:19.621 --> 47:31.557
The student told me, you know, Rico, we are born with a single idea in mind, and all during our life we are following always that same idea.

47:31.958 --> 47:33.780
And I was very upset.

47:33.800 --> 47:39.908
I said it's very rational, this thought, because it means that there is no development.

47:39.928 --> 47:49.341
Then, getting old, I recognized that my professor was in some way right,

47:49.878 --> 48:01.470
I have the impression to have followed obsessively all along my life the same seminal idea, and the only problem is that I don't know which one.

48:03.112 --> 48:06.776
And I will discover it at the moment of my death.

48:07.456 --> 48:11.220
I will have a sudden illumination, but it will be too late.

48:11.360 --> 48:15.885
And you also were quoted once as saying,

48:16.304 --> 48:23.293
you made a decision in your life, there are two ways to, to, to live forever, I guess, is to make a book and to make a kid.

48:23.614 --> 48:25.120
Yeah, yeah.

48:25.201 --> 48:26.044
That's,

48:26.193 --> 48:26.954
You haven't changed.

48:26.974 --> 48:29.979
Fortunately, I made two kids and 30 books.

48:30.360 --> 48:33.144
Imagine if I made two books and 30 kids.

48:33.164 --> 48:34.186
What a life!

48:34.807 --> 48:35.949
That's great.

48:35.969 --> 48:39.875
I'm not going to... But is this book, you see this book as a fable?

48:40.376 --> 48:42.720
You can see it as a fable.

48:44.343 --> 48:52.015
Every narrative is a fable, but if you want to trace a distinction between novel and romance,

48:52.147 --> 48:59.580
Probably this one is more a romance than a novel.

48:59.680 --> 49:03.927
I don't want to take up too much of your time as I said.

49:04.508 --> 49:07.193
It's a pleasure.

49:08.636 --> 49:10.519
Tell me where I can send you an address.

49:10.759 --> 49:15.167
I'll send you a copy of the story if you'd like.

49:15.333 --> 49:17.515
I'll just write it down.

49:18.156 --> 49:22.721
I'll give you the one of Milano.

49:22.741 --> 49:23.141
Whatever.

49:23.382 --> 49:31.570
I might like to, if possible, I'm going to write another book about books with European themes, and I might like to come and do an extended interview with you.

49:33.573 --> 49:34.514
If you'd be interested.

49:35.635 --> 49:44.344
And on the contrary, you have to drop me an information like the title of that longitude book I give.

49:44.577 --> 49:48.181
You have an email address in Milano.

49:54.108 --> 49:55.109
You know the O.J.

49:55.129 --> 49:58.573
Simpson's email address?

49:58.794 --> 49:59.314
Slash?

49:59.354 --> 49:59.935
Slash, yeah.

49:59.955 --> 50:00.736
Slash escape.

50:04.921 --> 50:11.749
Yesterday, my friend Tom Siebel told me the last one, probably you know, the lawyer.

50:12.050 --> 50:18.042
during the trial it comes to Jay and says I have bad news and good news you know.

50:19.065 --> 50:30.508
First the bad news and the bad news that they examined the blood on the spot with the DNA test and they discovered it was really your own blood.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.290
The good news

50:31.270 --> 50:34.414
Oh, the cholesterol is very low.

50:34.434 --> 50:38.619
There was another one that said when the judge told him he was free to go.

50:38.979 --> 50:40.681
Yes, I said, give my globe.

50:40.701 --> 50:43.144
I said, like my hat and my socks and my clothes.

50:43.164 --> 50:44.606
And the limousine service.

50:44.626 --> 50:51.794
I'm setting up a limousine service with the motto, you will be over sometime with an hour to kill.

50:51.894 --> 50:54.898
Would you inscribe a couple of things to do?
