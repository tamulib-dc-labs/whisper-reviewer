00:02.714 --> 00:04.356
We're talking to Bob Parker.

00:04.376 --> 00:05.797
I love this book.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.299
You're feeling very comfortable.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.542
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

00:11.562 --> 00:14.445
I sense comfort here and ease.

00:14.905 --> 00:15.646
I'm very old.

00:15.766 --> 00:16.607
I've relaxed.

00:18.569 --> 00:21.631
I've got to tell you a cute story which is totally irrelevant.

00:21.651 --> 00:22.792
Anyway, you said you're wrong.

00:22.913 --> 00:25.355
That's not an excuse.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.837
When Keats was my edge, he'd been dead for 40 years.

00:27.977 --> 00:29.078
I tracked them all.

00:29.218 --> 00:32.181
I started with Keats and then I passed...

00:32.617 --> 00:36.283
Shelly, and then she passed Byron and Fitzgerald.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.129
When you can't go to Wordsworth, you know you're really getting there.

00:40.149 --> 00:43.034
I've passed Hemingway.

00:44.096 --> 00:49.805
Yeah, well, I've done, what, 23, 24 Spencer books, something like that, and several others.

00:50.446 --> 00:52.550
I've got about 30 books, I guess, that I've written.

00:53.351 --> 00:56.937
By that time, you know you can.

00:57.153 --> 00:58.935
You can bring the heat, as the ballplayers say.

00:58.995 --> 01:00.397
Yeah, right, right.

01:00.417 --> 01:07.645
And you're in a zone, you know, and you, I mean, I think that the, I never know whether one book is better or worse than another.

01:08.906 --> 01:09.868
I assume they are.

01:10.088 --> 01:12.090
You know, I assume some books are better, some books are worse.

01:12.350 --> 01:15.294
You can't write 30 books and have them all be exactly the same.

01:15.314 --> 01:16.815
But I never know it when I'm writing it.

01:17.556 --> 01:26.907
And my own inclination, and I don't reread them, is probably that the later books, the last five, six years, have been better than the earlier ones.

01:27.224 --> 01:36.213
I know there are people who feel just reverse, that they like the gritty, hard-boiled, more traditional stuff of the early books.

01:36.254 --> 01:39.765
You give them a couple of hard-boiled scenes in there, though.

01:40.336 --> 01:50.350
And some of those other books where you had gone, like Don Auto Island, this is really a nice Boston, I mean, with the exception, of course, in Vegas.

01:50.551 --> 01:53.315
Were you interested in really kind of getting into this gambling?

01:53.915 --> 02:04.971
Well, I just thought, I mean, you know, I'd do a book a year, pretty much, and it is, let me just pause for a moment, room service.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.013
Sure.

02:07.475 --> 02:07.575
Sure.

02:09.412 --> 02:11.855
And I was thinking up the next story.

02:11.915 --> 02:16.039
I mean, that's what I'm always doing after I finished the last one.

02:16.980 --> 02:20.704
And the thought came to me, Spencer in Vegas, and I thought his take on Vegas.

02:21.344 --> 02:25.389
I had never driven through Vegas, but I'd never actually been to Vegas when the thought occurred to me.

02:25.429 --> 02:25.749
Come on.

02:26.470 --> 02:27.311
I've been since.

02:27.571 --> 02:28.972
Before I wrote the book, I went to Vegas.

02:28.992 --> 02:31.955
Well, honestly, because you really had to get to Mirage.

02:31.975 --> 02:33.337
But I've driven.

02:34.198 --> 02:37.461
We had a house until recently in Los Angeles that spent the winters out there.

02:37.930 --> 02:41.875
And I would drive Pearl the Wonder Dog back and forth because she doesn't like to fly.

02:42.456 --> 02:44.759
And Joan would fly, and Pearl and I would drive cross-country.

02:44.779 --> 02:47.082
So I've driven through Vegas, which is hysterical.

02:47.162 --> 02:51.567
I mean, you know, driving through the desert, and all of a sudden this idiotic place rears itself.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.091
And then you drive a little further, and it's gone.

02:54.131 --> 02:55.152
You're back in the desert again.

02:55.192 --> 02:57.355
I mean, it's like Oz.

02:58.616 --> 03:00.479
So that's really all it was, Spencer and Vegas.

03:00.499 --> 03:02.321
And I thought it would be interesting to see what he thought of it.

03:02.882 --> 03:03.803
So Joan and I went out.

03:04.222 --> 03:06.044
you know, for about a week and walked around.

03:06.064 --> 03:06.925
Stayed at the Mirage?

03:07.065 --> 03:08.326
We stayed at the Mirage, yeah.

03:08.346 --> 03:10.768
Did you have this spectacular?

03:10.828 --> 03:13.711
Oh yeah, the goddamn volcano.

03:13.791 --> 03:14.852
It kept going off.

03:14.872 --> 03:15.773
I mean, that's interesting.

03:15.873 --> 03:19.577
Once every 15 minutes, you know?

03:19.597 --> 03:22.760
The volcano's going again, you know?

03:22.780 --> 03:28.445
In a bizarre kind of way, we had fun.

03:28.565 --> 03:29.366
Because we didn't expect it.

03:29.386 --> 03:30.167
Yeah, we had fun.

03:30.327 --> 03:31.748
I have no desire to go back.

03:32.217 --> 03:33.179
But we had some fun.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.862
I'm not interested in gambling.

03:35.183 --> 03:36.526
I'm not opposed to it.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.111
It just doesn't get my attention.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.857
You know, I sense that because there really is no insight here in gambling.

03:41.877 --> 03:42.678
No, no.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.622
That's nothing much that I do.

03:46.386 --> 03:50.855
You know, I used to play poker with a guy sometimes and drink a little beer and play poker.

03:50.895 --> 03:53.280
I'm the kind of poker player that always would be saying that.

03:53.783 --> 03:56.108
So Full House beat a straight, you know.

03:56.128 --> 03:59.936
But I mean, the way you know food and other things, you don't know... No, I don't know gambling.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.138
You don't know gambling at all.

04:01.158 --> 04:05.447
And in fact, the dust jacket has a dye on it when the Game of Quest is black jacket.

04:06.189 --> 04:07.852
It's like waiting for the dye.

04:08.053 --> 04:09.556
The crabs came to get started.

04:10.057 --> 04:11.941
Jackets aren't they doing?

04:11.961 --> 04:14.526
No, but it's nice.

04:15.232 --> 04:17.514
And of course, how about the stuff about the Russians in there?

04:17.534 --> 04:20.477
I mean, is this the Boston mob, is this something that they're playing?

04:20.497 --> 04:24.902
Well, the Russian mafia is coming and is beginning a problem.

04:26.163 --> 04:29.266
And it just popped into my head.

04:29.286 --> 04:34.671
I don't know whether I, you know, one of the things you have to face is how much do I know about the Russian mafia, you know?

04:35.192 --> 04:43.720
And I can't, I can either research it, which might get me shot, or I can move on or something else.

04:44.054 --> 04:49.202
But on the other hand, how much does the reader know about the Russian Mafia?

04:49.242 --> 04:55.712
So there's a, what was it, Henry James said, that it doesn't matter so much what experience you've had, it's what you do with it, you know?

04:56.032 --> 05:08.391
Well, I heard, just coincidentally, a couple of months ago, when I was in New York at the book fair, I mean, a guy who was, an Italian guy, who was, you know, in Washington, he was very well-connected up, and I don't forget how he did it, he said, but

05:08.877 --> 05:11.219
Now, if you want to rub somebody out, you hire Russians.

05:11.239 --> 05:13.501
Yeah, that's my understanding, too.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.702
And it's very reasonable, apparently.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.743
It's not a lot of money.

05:15.903 --> 05:18.986
Well, they've, you know, that's one of the great benefits of Glasnost.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.509
Get a cheap hit, not from a Russian.

05:22.529 --> 05:23.970
They drive cabs and they kill people.

05:23.990 --> 05:24.631
That's what they do.

05:24.651 --> 05:25.631
They come in and they do it.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.433
But I have to tell you, you had me here.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.156
I was really, I'm pretty good at figuring out where these things are going.

05:32.217 --> 05:35.200
Anaheim, is that just a whack at Southern Cal?

05:35.360 --> 05:37.021
No, I just didn't make it in my head.

05:37.041 --> 05:37.922
There's a...

05:38.172 --> 05:39.594
a character named Ventura as well.

05:40.094 --> 05:42.417
I probably was, you know, it's probably been out there too much.

05:42.878 --> 05:52.170
Yeah, but I wonder, you say you don't read the books once they're done, but yet I sense that there is a possibility for a sequel here.

05:52.190 --> 05:54.072
You know, I mean, the characters are replaced.

05:54.472 --> 06:04.004
The principal bad guy is, you have him ready to talk to the fence where I'm not going to give this thing away, and the girl has gone back in theory.

06:04.024 --> 06:06.087
Well, I don't have a master plan.

06:06.286 --> 06:12.853
When people from earlier novels crop up in the later novel, it's because I think of them in the later novel.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.175
I look back and I say, oh, it's sort of like life.

06:15.816 --> 06:17.437
Who could I call on for this?

06:18.679 --> 06:22.482
The next novel is not a sequel to this one.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.965
It's called Small Vices and it's done.

06:26.166 --> 06:30.170
And it has no particular connection to this one.

06:30.591 --> 06:34.875
This doesn't mean that I won't go back, like I went back to Fast Eddie Lee again here.

06:35.092 --> 06:40.398
seem useful to me, and I'll probably go back to various people at one time or another.

06:40.418 --> 06:44.122
In those cases, you do have to kind of go back and see how you... I have to make sure.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.283
I will thumb back.

06:45.323 --> 06:46.645
Make sure that they're alive.

06:46.665 --> 06:49.868
Yeah, I'll make sure, you know, how tall were they or what did they look like.

06:49.989 --> 06:57.096
Yeah, I usually go back and read the passages about them that I wrote before, but I never sit down and read my books.

06:57.657 --> 07:00.340
It's an interesting thing, because the point I have to make when I'm speaking

07:00.893 --> 07:12.672
The audience or the reader knows my book in a very different way than I do because you consume this in a few hours on an airplane flight or a couple of evenings or something like that.

07:13.253 --> 07:19.283
I created it in small five-page segments over a period of four or five months and never read it in total.

07:19.383 --> 07:21.928
I don't read the whole thing through once I'm done.

07:22.909 --> 07:23.670
You really don't.

07:23.691 --> 07:24.251
I really don't.

07:24.271 --> 07:25.213
I've never read this.

07:25.598 --> 07:28.241
I've never actually read this book the way you read it.

07:28.261 --> 07:30.905
And I read it really in one sitting.

07:30.925 --> 07:31.766
One sitting, probably.

07:31.846 --> 07:32.647
And I read it quickly.

07:32.767 --> 07:33.328
Yeah, I do, too.

07:33.388 --> 07:34.690
I would read it in one sitting, probably.

07:34.710 --> 07:36.172
And then I basically did it last night.

07:36.192 --> 07:39.216
Yeah, I read More Leonard in one sitting, for instance.

07:39.296 --> 07:40.097
Which is about right.

07:40.117 --> 07:40.978
Yeah, that's right.

07:41.519 --> 07:48.568
And so I know, I bet, I bet I know Dutch's books in a way that he doesn't, you know, because I bet he doesn't read them in one sitting.

07:48.588 --> 07:49.069
And that's right.

07:49.089 --> 07:50.591
No, I never reread them all.

07:50.611 --> 07:51.232
I'll go back.

07:51.272 --> 07:53.074
How about when they come back in galleys?

07:53.678 --> 07:54.600
I don't read the galleys.

07:55.381 --> 07:58.205
I mean, there's a sentence here where you use the word stiffen three times.

07:58.246 --> 08:00.048
I said, I wish the hell he'd fix that.

08:00.069 --> 08:01.611
Yeah, I wish I had two.

08:02.212 --> 08:02.893
Keep putting that one up.

08:02.913 --> 08:09.043
To the end where the woman is crying and she stiffens and she stiffens and she stiffens.

08:09.424 --> 08:10.666
The copy editor is supposed to get that.

08:10.686 --> 08:12.349
The copy editor is supposed to get that.

08:13.491 --> 08:17.998
But what I do with the galleys is I read the queries, but I don't reread.

08:18.772 --> 08:20.755
Do you do much research, Fred?

08:20.775 --> 08:22.197
Pardon me for asking stupid questions.

08:22.217 --> 08:24.620
We haven't come at this territory before.

08:25.581 --> 08:31.429
And I do have a wealth of stuff to draw on from here, so I'm not going to... Well, questions are... I mean, what are you going to ask, you know?

08:31.489 --> 08:36.536
Yeah, I'm going to ask a point that... Well, no, I don't do much research.

08:37.036 --> 08:39.219
You know, I wouldn't try to write about a place without going there.

08:39.259 --> 08:41.722
I wrote, you know, I wouldn't write about Vegas without visiting Vegas.

08:42.323 --> 08:44.887
And I wouldn't try to talk about things I didn't see.

08:45.728 --> 08:48.171
Sometimes I will make something up, you know...

08:48.590 --> 08:50.993
I'll make up a town if I, if I need a town.

08:51.053 --> 08:51.354
As you've done.

08:51.554 --> 08:52.455
As I've done.

08:52.495 --> 08:55.760
Down in Rhode Island and there, which is Central Falls.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.641
Yeah, that's right.

08:56.781 --> 08:58.924
You did something up in the Quabbin area once, I think.

08:59.124 --> 08:59.725
Yeah, that's right.

08:59.865 --> 09:04.411
And I did a town in Illinois once called Redford, which I made up.

09:05.313 --> 09:12.783
That I could do, but I, you know, even, even out in the Quabbin area when I went up to Ware and looked around before I made up whatever I called in the book.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.749
But other than that, no, I don't, I don't do a great deal of research.

09:18.250 --> 09:18.310
Uh,

09:18.847 --> 09:26.914
I get gun magazines, you know, and read them, which then gets me on the mailing list of some of the wildest freak dogs on the planet.

09:27.455 --> 09:29.676
You probably think you're one of the guys.

09:30.017 --> 09:35.241
Yeah, I get all sorts of NRA stuff and, you know, save our rights and things.

09:37.003 --> 09:41.907
But, you know, just so I, if you make a mistake with a gun, you get more mail than any other thing.

09:42.768 --> 09:44.349
I found this out in my old book.

09:44.650 --> 09:48.533
I mean, the things you don't even expect to come out of the woodwork, you know.

09:49.424 --> 09:55.313
If you had The Wizard of Oz being published in 1902 or 1901, you know.

09:56.395 --> 09:59.219
You have people get all out of the shop, yeah.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.541
Give me a, you know.

10:01.402 --> 10:02.263
Yeah.

10:02.464 --> 10:05.408
I sometimes wonder if I'll get a life, maybe, you know.

10:05.488 --> 10:11.217
I guess one thing I'd like to talk about this piece, as I've done before, but your concept of Spencer.

10:11.337 --> 10:12.839
I mean, this is clearly right now.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.201
It's 1996.

10:15.183 --> 10:16.545
Everything is contemporary.

10:16.930 --> 10:46.870
uh he is tell me about how he's aging i mean this is not like a classic private guy yeah it's uh he's fixed in place you know well it's a it's a problem which i have tried to solve essentially by ignoring it that is uh i have established clearly that he was in the korean war that he fought joe walcott he has my memories i'm 63 uh and uh you know uh i can't get away from that even if i wanted to which i don't because it seems to give him more density

10:47.356 --> 10:51.080
But what I simply do is I don't mention his age.

10:51.400 --> 10:58.847
He's got to be about 60 years old now if one were to track him back, or 61, or, you know, in that early 60s range.

10:59.928 --> 11:14.663
And, you know, I just ignore it because I don't think it is, I don't think it's credible if you are reminded that he is, say, my age, 63.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.094
Even though, in fact, it can be, I'm still in pretty good shape.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.897
And Joan and I are still quite romantic.

11:21.838 --> 11:26.244
And, you know, I mean, it doesn't suddenly go away when you pass a certain mark.

11:26.864 --> 11:30.789
But it isn't a credible, you know, it's not what you think of when you read a book.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.973
So I just, what I have done is simply don't mention his age.

11:35.615 --> 11:40.701
And don't touch upon, you know, he doesn't have, I have an arthritic left shoulder, you know.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.263
My knees are sad.

11:42.283 --> 11:43.986
He doesn't have both.

11:44.006 --> 11:45.207
But you also made a decision

11:45.845 --> 11:49.430
not to fix them in place, too, and I think we can go a little deeper.

11:50.591 --> 11:55.097
There must be some kind of philosophical... Oh, God, I wish there were.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.979
It would sound so good if I said it.

11:58.381 --> 12:01.465
No, it's just, maybe I did.

12:03.908 --> 12:07.212
Much of this is far less thoughtful than it would appear.

12:08.193 --> 12:12.679
Much of it is, I always like to say, right with my hands, you know.

12:13.030 --> 12:13.931
it sort of comes out.

12:13.951 --> 12:21.219
This does not mean it's unintelligent, and it does not mean it's unimaginative, but it means it's not entirely conscious all the time, I think.

12:23.381 --> 12:40.860
But I don't, you know, I remember, I mean, I suppose the classic example is Archie Goodman and Nero Wolfe, you know, I mean, Archie was 34 or 5 or something like that in the first novel, and he was 34 or 5 in the last novel, but he went through the Second World War, he was a major and all of that, and Wolfe never aged.

12:41.330 --> 12:49.641
Marlow went from, I think, 32 to 42 in his six, seven books.

12:51.544 --> 12:54.568
It seems like more than six or seven books, doesn't it?

12:54.588 --> 12:54.688
Yeah.

12:56.050 --> 12:59.175
It's seven.

13:00.416 --> 13:01.638
Do you see this as a corpus?

13:01.698 --> 13:09.008
I mean, even though you don't go back and look at them, I mean, is it the kind of... Oh, yeah, because it is all part of one long writing process.

13:09.511 --> 13:20.464
or sort of like one ongoing story that I can recall the broad outlines of all the books, and I can recall characters from books if I ever need them.

13:21.706 --> 13:30.997
You know, minor characters, people, I may not even remember their name, but I remember the pimp in the second book I wrote, you know, and I go back and I find him.

13:32.278 --> 13:36.143
Or in this one, I came up with that cop that I used in...

13:36.832 --> 13:39.475
New York cop that I used in Tammy Seahorse.

13:39.916 --> 13:40.636
Couldn't remember his name.

13:40.677 --> 13:42.318
I had to go back to Tammy Seahorse and find him.

13:44.681 --> 13:47.785
So, but I, you know, I don't remember the details.

13:48.526 --> 13:51.910
Again, you get, there was a fan club someplace.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.652
I'm sure you get this in a club somewhere.

13:53.972 --> 14:02.622
We've talked five times that they used to have the Spencer Trivia Quiz, and I was supposed to be the judge, and the first time they did, they had five wrong, you know.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.687
I don't have that.

14:06.886 --> 14:12.914
But one of their questions, I still remember one of the questions, name five years in the Spencer novels that had been mentioned but not drunk.

14:15.298 --> 14:16.579
I'm 0 for 5 on that.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.163
Talk about ghetto life.

14:20.445 --> 14:25.291
And you still, when you start, it's not a pain in the neck.

14:25.692 --> 14:25.912
No.

14:25.932 --> 14:26.913
Do you enjoy it?

14:27.594 --> 14:28.896
Well, you've written a book.

14:29.857 --> 14:30.979
You don't exactly enjoy it.

14:31.460 --> 14:34.043
I would rather do it than not do it.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.425
I would miss it if I didn't.

14:35.827 --> 14:40.592
I haven't for a while because I've been promoting, and I get restless after a while if I don't.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.653
I plan to keep doing it.

14:42.373 --> 14:45.596
But like so many things, it's hard when you do it, and I'm glad when it's over.

14:46.557 --> 14:49.600
But I'll do it again tomorrow, you know.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.221
That's what I do.

14:50.401 --> 14:56.386
And you are now writing, I think, the last four or five books on a computer, which you said you'd never do.

14:57.487 --> 15:00.070
So the typewriter broke, and I had to join the century.

15:00.170 --> 15:03.353
And did you find any difference at all in the writing?

15:04.463 --> 15:06.628
I don't find any difference, but I bet there is one.

15:07.730 --> 15:21.722
It would be somebody's doctoral thesis someday to chart the difference between... Well, when I went to your house the last time, and you did have the home computer there, I sensed something different.

15:22.263 --> 15:23.907
I think it's smoother, actually.

15:24.089 --> 15:24.650
I do, too.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.437
Whether you like it or you do revise, you tend to revise a hell of a lot more.

15:28.457 --> 15:29.859
Yeah, you owe much you should revise.

15:30.421 --> 15:32.705
You don't throw away the paper and you get the thing right.

15:32.725 --> 15:35.570
No, I mean, revision on a typewriter is, you know, a major effort.

15:35.931 --> 15:37.033
Revision on a computer is nothing.

15:37.053 --> 15:42.142
You owe a piece of paper and you owe a piece of paper and make a very fundamental decision.

15:42.162 --> 15:44.526
And the computer, the process is endless.

15:44.546 --> 15:47.211
You can revise endlessly.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.692
I don't revise endlessly, but I do revise far more than I would have without it.

15:51.953 --> 15:56.939
And the only real character in this is Pearl the Wonder Dog, right?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.761
That's right.

15:58.802 --> 16:01.125
If you met her, you would recognize her.

16:01.185 --> 16:01.805
Even the name?

16:01.906 --> 16:04.889
No, it is Pearl.

16:04.909 --> 16:05.610
That's her.

16:05.811 --> 16:08.174
Someone asked me, is this really your dog?

16:08.314 --> 16:09.275
Do you think it's a model?

16:09.295 --> 16:11.037
It's a model for this thing?

16:11.057 --> 16:11.859
Yeah, it's my dog.

16:12.459 --> 16:13.240
It's a great picture.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.343
They love dog pictures.

16:15.363 --> 16:16.084
Apparently.

16:16.216 --> 16:18.400
I mean, you know, I've got editors at that.

16:18.540 --> 16:25.090
I mean, if I can get a picture with a dog in a minute, and color, by the way, tell Putnam to get a colored picture.

16:25.130 --> 16:27.995
They are on the paperbacks, they're on the back, they're colored.

16:28.015 --> 16:29.357
I wish I should remember to bring that.

16:29.377 --> 16:34.686
I've got newspapers that will, I can sell stories to, just if they're colored pictures.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.769
Because, I mean, it's the art.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.472
Yeah, right, they like the way it looks, yeah.

16:38.713 --> 16:39.955
Well, I mean, they can do more.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.679
There are sections now, they're doing color.

16:43.047 --> 16:46.411
I really don't have to take up too much of your time.

16:46.972 --> 16:47.172
Okay.

16:47.232 --> 16:49.095
I'd love you to subscribe to my book.

16:49.115 --> 16:49.335
Sure.

16:49.836 --> 16:51.558
That's a brave sound I think we should point out.

16:51.578 --> 16:51.998
That's right.

16:52.139 --> 16:54.321
Did you listen to Upton yesterday?

16:54.341 --> 16:54.762
Say again?

16:54.942 --> 16:57.325
Upton Bell made a fundamental mistake.

16:57.706 --> 16:58.106
Is that right?

16:58.206 --> 16:59.127
No, no, I know that.

16:59.148 --> 17:03.553
But Upton's supposed to be, I'm going to steal this pen from these people too, because I've got to sign books, I hope.

17:03.593 --> 17:04.935
Well, that's a lousy pen.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.056
I like these pens.

17:09.020 --> 17:09.361
Good pen.

17:10.122 --> 17:12.885
It's in my collection.

17:16.561 --> 17:18.824
I haven't written with a fountain pen for years.

17:18.984 --> 17:24.652
I'm going to ABA this week.

17:24.673 --> 17:25.974
Are you being spared this?

17:26.075 --> 17:27.296
I'm being spared this.

17:27.757 --> 17:31.162
Haven't been since New York, I think.

17:31.182 --> 17:41.877
I mean, whether he's an alter ego or not, but you hear his voice.

17:42.097 --> 17:44.320
I mean, you actually visualize his voice.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.163
Do you have him as a picture of Spencer?

17:46.430 --> 17:46.770
No.

17:47.952 --> 17:49.213
I don't quite know what he looks like.

17:49.253 --> 17:54.700
And I don't quite know what he sounds like, although I can hear him and I can see him.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.766
But it's not clear exactly what he looks like.

17:59.826 --> 18:02.089
People are always asking, would you like to have play him?

18:02.670 --> 18:04.813
Or was Robert Yorick your vision of Spencer?

18:05.133 --> 18:05.313
No.

18:07.175 --> 18:08.077
Who would I have play him?

18:08.557 --> 18:10.820
Well, Tommy Lee Jones, Harrison Ford.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.081
Once you get that, it'll open a picture.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.985
These questions are so remote from...

18:15.134 --> 18:17.820
But I think it's what people really want to know, is, well, what does he look like?

18:18.441 --> 18:20.566
And I don't know, I guess... Yeah, that's what I ask, basically.

18:20.586 --> 18:24.494
I guess whether you have a vision of a little picture, and his voice, I guess.

18:24.695 --> 18:25.537
Yeah, yeah.

18:25.937 --> 18:30.247
No, the voice is there, because it tells the story, and it's a fairly consistent voice.

18:30.287 --> 18:32.432
And is the voice, in fact, his, or is it yours?

18:32.632 --> 18:33.293
I think it's his.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.438
I don't think I talk quite that way.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.370
Oh, the sense of humor has got to be with his book.

18:38.430 --> 18:39.491
Well, I can't.

18:39.531 --> 18:40.272
You collaborate.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.134
Well, he couldn't have it if I didn't.

18:42.475 --> 18:42.995
No, he can't.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.257
It's wonderful.

18:44.277 --> 18:48.081
His sense of humor is, you know, wonderful.

18:49.743 --> 18:51.005
Yeah.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.687
There are those who don't like her.

18:53.348 --> 18:54.089
Oh.

18:54.629 --> 18:56.131
That's part of the game.

18:56.912 --> 19:00.997
And there are those who, well, there are those who don't like anything.

19:01.017 --> 19:05.442
You know, I mean, I can find people who don't like every single thing about my books if you get reviewed enough.

19:06.350 --> 19:10.235
If it were for differences of opinion, there wouldn't be any bookmakers, right?

19:10.575 --> 19:12.017
That's right.

19:12.037 --> 19:12.357
Exactly.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.980
And that's, that'll be fine.

19:15.020 --> 19:15.761
They could disagree.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.944
And you do mention the Indian Reservation down there.

19:17.964 --> 19:20.106
Have you been down to the Foxwoods at all?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.067
No.

19:21.087 --> 19:21.308
No.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.671
I haven't actually been there a couple of times.

19:24.692 --> 19:26.414
No, as I say, it holds no interest for me.

19:26.594 --> 19:27.615
I get bored, you know.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.357
I don't much care if I win or lose.

19:29.557 --> 19:32.120
I mean, if I lose a ton, I'm unhappy.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.304
But I don't normally, just don't interest.

19:35.344 --> 19:36.205
Susan's attitude.

19:37.079 --> 19:39.021
to gambling probably reflects yours.

19:39.541 --> 19:40.542
You know, Joan's more.

19:40.703 --> 19:47.890
Joan is, that scene where Susan is gambling and... Totally going against all... Yeah, that's Joan.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.952
That's because Joan did that.

19:49.972 --> 19:52.534
She said, you've got to stand next to me and tell me how to play blackjack.

19:52.554 --> 19:55.858
So I stood next to her and told her what to do, and she paid no attention to me.

19:55.878 --> 19:57.119
And I said, what am I standing here for?

19:57.139 --> 19:59.261
She said, well, it's too boring to stand there and wait.

19:59.321 --> 20:00.302
You also want to cut it too.

20:00.442 --> 20:02.344
Yeah, I want to cut it.
