WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:03.905
Same pattern.

00:04.005 --> 00:05.167
What are you showing us now?

00:05.667 --> 00:08.031
Decorative doorknobs from the turn of the century.

00:08.051 --> 00:08.632
Aren't those beautiful?

00:08.652 --> 00:09.393
Those are gorgeous.

00:09.894 --> 00:10.975
Cast bronze.

00:12.117 --> 00:14.581
How many people you think would want one of these on your house?

00:14.601 --> 00:15.182
Lots of people.

00:16.183 --> 00:16.784
Lots of people.

00:16.824 --> 00:19.147
Those are quite beautiful.

00:20.730 --> 00:25.617
These were made by the BLW company.

00:30.625 --> 00:36.510
Branford Lock Company, that's what it is.

00:37.031 --> 00:39.833
And Branford merged into Yale in 1892.

00:39.954 --> 00:41.995
It was bought out by Yale.

00:42.996 --> 00:43.717
You're welcome.

00:43.737 --> 00:43.877
Yeah.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.199
This is an old Branford.

00:46.219 --> 00:47.320
I had a catalog, sir.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.522
I didn't know why I could get a J. Rosen.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.423
Got a mad crook.

00:50.543 --> 00:51.184
I trusted him.

00:51.845 --> 00:52.565
Yeah, he's pretty good.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.527
If I had the choice, I wouldn't have kept my money out.

00:54.627 --> 00:55.628
They hid it, you see.

00:55.808 --> 00:57.990
I'd have never left the American out of Miami.

00:58.010 --> 00:58.911
He ain't got about it.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.548
Goddamn, he had three sets of keys made of mine.

01:02.568 --> 01:05.412
I could have come out there if I had been a damn dove.

01:06.353 --> 01:08.836
And we tied them around in trees out there.

01:08.856 --> 01:10.639
He said, you only have plenty of keys.

01:11.300 --> 01:15.085
Well, he had that mine all the time, so he'd steal that goddamn one.

01:15.105 --> 01:22.114
He went there and got that key out of the, out of the spruce trees.

01:22.651 --> 01:24.533
I said, it was gone.

01:24.554 --> 01:26.396
This is from about 1885.

01:26.516 --> 01:29.360
That other lock set was from about 189.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.366
I don't think that'd be too smart anyway, tying the key and the tree.

01:34.967 --> 01:38.352
Well, I should have caught all of that, but I had three sets of keys made.

01:39.073 --> 01:41.616
I said, you're allowed to lose some of these keys.

01:41.716 --> 01:44.320
I said, you'll have to pay for them yourself.

01:44.340 --> 01:47.163
Three cents.

01:47.263 --> 01:47.684
Okay.

01:47.784 --> 01:52.270
I had to cut all of that therapy or something, but I was...

01:53.144 --> 01:57.050
They are the Grand Army of Minnesota.

01:57.311 --> 02:01.478
And Governor, I think it's the Governor of Minnesota is sitting there.

02:01.498 --> 02:03.120
He's the guy with a suit.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.365
Was that the Confederate Brigadier General?

02:06.866 --> 02:08.749
His Excellency Canoon Nelson.

02:08.769 --> 02:09.891
He was governor.

02:10.132 --> 02:10.652
That's in 1898.

02:11.874 --> 02:12.576
Amazing.

02:12.596 --> 02:13.858
This is the Sibley House.

02:13.878 --> 02:16.302
That's the oldest house in Minnesota.

02:16.502 --> 02:20.248
Well, that's a professional job.

02:22.355 --> 02:30.669
I had all kinds of historical stuff like this that Rogues just took out of here and probably will sell for eight, ten dollars and nobody will even know what it is, you know.

02:30.809 --> 02:31.690
Here's another picture.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.014
That's beautiful.

02:34.034 --> 02:38.602
It's a watercolor, huh?

02:38.762 --> 02:40.565
It's a watercolor.

02:40.625 --> 02:44.211
I don't think anybody's going to steal them now.

02:44.697 --> 02:48.269
Yeah, I just carry film around.

02:48.510 --> 02:52.885
Is that your personal?

03:50.712 --> 03:54.957
This is where Rhodes stayed?

03:54.977 --> 04:00.502
Yeah, he stole all the doorknobs.

04:00.523 --> 04:02.304
That was his area.

04:02.344 --> 04:03.586
Then we sort of shared this.

04:03.606 --> 04:04.747
This was his dining room.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.412
And he stole these mirrors out.

04:09.792 --> 04:10.914
He couldn't get this one out.

04:11.054 --> 04:11.614
It's too big.

04:12.175 --> 04:14.998
Off the mantel pieces and stripped the chandeliers out of here.

04:16.295 --> 04:24.508
And, you know, beds, and then he took all the, this was just packed for antique furniture, knickknacks and globes and all this thing.

04:24.528 --> 04:25.690
So he really raped the place?

04:25.790 --> 04:26.050
Yeah.

04:27.232 --> 04:27.953
What did you have in here?

04:27.993 --> 04:28.935
Were there books in here?

04:29.977 --> 04:34.564
No, no, they were all antique light fixtures and globes.

04:34.584 --> 04:35.866
Those are beautiful cabinets.

04:36.126 --> 04:36.427
Yeah.

04:36.988 --> 04:38.129
You brought them in or they were here?

04:38.149 --> 04:40.613
Yeah, no, I brought them in here.

04:40.633 --> 04:41.354
Those are wonderful.

04:41.675 --> 04:43.618
There was another big mirror on this.

04:44.392 --> 04:45.433
Like that one.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.154
He took that.

04:46.274 --> 04:48.417
He took the gas electric chandelier.

04:48.477 --> 04:49.158
It had gripped them.

04:49.278 --> 04:50.680
It's a beautiful chandelier.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.401
He stole that.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.063
That's a gorgeous window.

04:53.083 --> 04:53.603
That was here?

04:54.064 --> 04:57.568
Yeah, and there were four other ones in there, and he took those.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.792
The stained glass windows out there.

05:04.857 --> 05:06.900
I'd rather fight than switch from Wolvard.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.622
Yeah, he's the governor of Minnesota.

05:08.762 --> 05:09.924
He was.

05:10.304 --> 05:11.125
No, I don't care.

05:12.691 --> 05:16.174
Kevin, look at this, bud.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.355
Is that a fireplace?

05:17.615 --> 05:18.836
Yeah.

05:18.856 --> 05:22.059
It had a mirror on it like that, but the snitch ripped the mirror off.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.942
Is this open or something?

05:25.022 --> 05:30.667
Yeah, it ripped out.

05:30.687 --> 05:32.949
So where were the books?

05:33.009 --> 05:35.271
Well, I had a desk secretary here.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.152
There were a few here.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.454
And this was my book.

05:38.514 --> 05:42.057
These were my books on numismatics.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.583
And I had some nice bindings.

05:45.003 --> 05:48.367
N-U-M-I-S-M-H-E-I-C-S, numismatics, right?

05:48.828 --> 05:49.088
Yeah.

05:49.929 --> 05:53.033
And I had a big dining room table here, and this was silverware.

05:53.914 --> 05:55.155
He stole all of that.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.959
Boy, he was something.

05:57.979 --> 05:59.681
Look at this, FBI evidence.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.603
Yeah.

06:01.623 --> 06:01.964
Still?

06:03.466 --> 06:05.888
Yeah, maybe they were going to take the cases or something.

06:05.908 --> 06:11.335
These windows are so close to the ground level next to the alley, I blocked them and graded them.

06:11.568 --> 06:14.933
Put screening out there so that nobody could get in, you know.

06:15.794 --> 06:17.076
Who are the kids, the pictures?

06:19.961 --> 06:21.643
I think one of them is David Brooks.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.366
David and Steve Brooks.

06:25.289 --> 06:27.212
And he stole the chandelier out of there.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.082
We'll be upstairs, fellas.

06:36.880 --> 06:41.085
See, I got the doors to it, and I got the combination, but I couldn't get it stood up.

06:41.125 --> 06:49.815
I got it in the house with the car, pushed it up on pipes, and got it in here and steered it in there.

06:50.055 --> 06:57.003
And I had a real elaborate window up there, and oh, it's got that, and there was a lamp on here that was brass that had come up.

06:57.023 --> 06:59.266
Well, you really worked on the place, didn't you?

06:59.286 --> 07:04.132
Yeah, they stole a lamp chandelier.

07:04.152 --> 07:05.233
They stole a window out of there.

07:10.124 --> 07:13.648
And this is the hardware.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.850
Now, the FBI took this one for evidence.

07:15.870 --> 07:20.135
I built this wall and put that in there.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.237
And this is where I had the books.

07:23.939 --> 07:24.199
Wow.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.543
But you see, he stripped the light pictures out.

07:29.044 --> 07:29.565
There's one in here.

07:30.206 --> 07:31.907
Where was the California room that they had?

07:31.928 --> 07:32.208
Right here.

07:32.228 --> 07:32.488
This is it.

07:32.528 --> 07:33.029
This is it?

07:33.649 --> 07:36.472
I had a hundred incunables in there.

07:36.613 --> 07:37.954
That was where they kept the incunables?

07:38.845 --> 07:41.429
I'm going to get a picture of that, if that's okay with you.

07:43.252 --> 07:44.574
Okay, we're in the California one.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.355
Where was the number?

07:45.996 --> 07:47.138
On the lower shelf.

07:47.999 --> 07:56.632
Can I get a picture of you in here?

07:57.233 --> 08:00.758
Can I take out my coat?

08:00.778 --> 08:02.280
Four or three.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.043
Yeah, I'm going to take out my coat too.

08:08.933 --> 08:09.984
Over.

09:50.335 --> 10:04.852
17 rooms.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.884
And this here is the California room where I took the photographs.

10:15.845 --> 10:19.650
We had the Incunerals and the Nuremberg Chronicle in here.

10:20.744 --> 10:22.527
And I think he said he slept in this room.

10:22.627 --> 10:25.492
So he... Steve, this old couch here was your bed?

10:29.779 --> 10:29.859
Yep.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.981
You want me to move this out?

10:31.001 --> 10:31.762
No, it's okay.

10:31.783 --> 10:34.507
When I put it in, I put it in.

10:34.527 --> 10:40.317
I just don't know if it's laying or something like that.

10:40.337 --> 10:40.617
Throw him out.

10:40.637 --> 10:42.200
He's fixing up the shelves here.

10:45.586 --> 10:46.988
And the paper is over.

10:48.031 --> 10:52.117
Now, how did you protect the books of these shelves from sun?

10:53.919 --> 10:55.541
Well, I had grapes on them.

10:56.342 --> 10:58.165
Oh, okay.

10:58.645 --> 11:01.009
Because I'm so sure you were concerned about sunning, right?

11:01.029 --> 11:03.372
Yeah, yeah.

11:03.392 --> 11:05.034
Well, they'd have been well preserved in here.

11:05.054 --> 11:06.296
It's nice and dry here.

11:06.496 --> 11:08.499
Yeah, but you've got to watch the sun, though, too.

11:10.521 --> 11:12.424
What did you say you kept in this bookcase?

11:12.744 --> 11:14.086
Bindings.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.149
Bindings Americana, right?

11:16.169 --> 11:16.890
Yeah, right.

11:17.377 --> 11:29.010
This was all what?

11:30.151 --> 11:31.312
Bibliographies here.

11:31.332 --> 11:35.417
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

11:35.437 --> 11:38.180
The 10 high.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.141
Did you build these?

11:39.181 --> 11:39.381
Yeah.

11:39.441 --> 11:45.828
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

11:45.848 --> 11:46.489
11 shuttles.

11:47.296 --> 11:48.818
This is where all the boats were off?

11:48.938 --> 11:50.060
We ain't even went that way.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.542
How high were the ceilings?

11:51.622 --> 11:52.604
How high were the ceilings?

11:52.624 --> 11:53.084
13 feet.

11:53.104 --> 11:53.425
13 feet.

11:54.186 --> 11:56.249
This was architecture in here.

11:56.289 --> 11:57.350
Mm-hmm.

11:57.370 --> 11:59.093
And periodicals on architecture.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.757
And these were... Oh, that's beautiful.

12:02.618 --> 12:07.044
Oh, he stole the chandelier out of there.

12:07.505 --> 12:07.665
Really?

12:07.845 --> 12:08.807
Yeah, and out of here, too.

12:08.827 --> 12:10.730
That's why all the lights off.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.631
What's this thing, Steve?

12:11.651 --> 12:13.634
Let me get a picture of you with this thing.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.535
It's a magnet.

12:14.785 --> 12:16.287
Did you have maps in there?

12:16.307 --> 12:23.738
No, I had, uh, folios of old photos of Victorian buildings in e-books.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.322
Is there a clip or whatever they have?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.287
No, put your hand on it, too.

12:32.512 --> 12:32.872
Thanks.

12:32.892 --> 12:42.126
See, I had a lot of these letter files that were full of, uh, you know, paper, paper, stuff.

12:43.253 --> 12:49.020
And this, there was a shelf here, but they took it all out to get the stuff through here.

12:49.140 --> 12:59.233
And this was all solid all the way up.

12:59.253 --> 13:02.877
I guess I gotta get a flashlight out of the car.

13:02.897 --> 13:06.061
These are all shelved up, these rows up about the shandwares are out.

13:06.181 --> 13:07.523
That's why they picture the empty shelf.

13:12.953 --> 13:19.581
I'm just going to take a few notes, okay?

13:20.482 --> 13:27.930
Let me just... I wish I could have had you in here before the books were... Don't I wish, huh?

13:27.950 --> 13:29.031
Let me shut this off a little.

13:29.372 --> 13:40.464
Honorable, including Colonel Albert Lee Days, 1941, Albert Lee, Minnesota, honoring Lucy Hermanson, the individual having longest continuous residence in Freeporn County, approved Harold Stassen.

13:40.705 --> 13:41.485
Harold Stassen?

13:41.646 --> 13:42.807
Down in Missouri, Minnesota.

13:42.827 --> 13:42.927
Sure.

13:43.463 --> 13:44.584
Mayor of Albert Lee.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.867
Why do you suppose they left that?

13:49.410 --> 13:50.531
Was that part of the collection?

13:51.292 --> 13:54.195
Yeah, I had manuscripts and stuff.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.638
This was just something I picked up in the Twin Cities.

14:00.903 --> 14:11.715
Well, I know the Dewey system, like 917 is American travel, 972 through 6 is American history.

14:12.387 --> 14:16.292
Uh, 728 is architectural house plans and that.

14:16.332 --> 14:18.475
That's under due in the Library of Congress.

14:18.695 --> 14:22.339
F is American travel, American history.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.522
N-A is architecture.

14:24.582 --> 14:25.884
I memorized all that.

14:25.904 --> 14:26.164
Yeah.

14:26.484 --> 14:31.030
So, uh, I could put my own.

14:31.190 --> 14:31.511
Yeah.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.593
So, it'd be like, uh, call numbers on.

14:34.755 --> 14:36.297
Looks like you're gonna start a library.

14:36.617 --> 14:38.299
Well, I have a library here.

14:38.319 --> 14:39.120
Looks like it.

14:39.826 --> 14:44.030
This is the biggest, probably bigger library than the Des Moines library.

14:44.050 --> 14:54.661
You know, one time I was over talking to the principal over there at the high school, and I wanted to take advantage.

14:54.701 --> 15:05.952
Yeah, and I said, I suggested someday, I said, you know, I got a nice library in my house if someday you're teaching American history or something.

15:06.202 --> 15:09.226
And you have a few people that are scholars and so forth.

15:09.246 --> 15:13.512
They're welcome to come over to the house and do some research.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.617
Wouldn't that have been risky for you?

15:18.419 --> 15:19.080
Oh, I don't know.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.763
I really didn't have anything to hide.

15:21.624 --> 15:23.266
You didn't have anything to hide?

15:23.286 --> 15:27.252
Well, they wouldn't have, you know.

15:27.272 --> 15:27.352
Wow.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.134
These aren't shells?

15:29.154 --> 15:30.156
Yeah, I think they said.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.880
How many would you say you have altogether?

15:33.080 --> 15:33.260
What?

15:33.601 --> 15:34.001
Shells.

15:34.282 --> 15:34.622
Oh, I don't know.

15:36.509 --> 15:39.333
That's where I kept my architectural folios.

15:42.738 --> 15:44.661
In this room, did you have names for these rooms?

15:45.021 --> 15:46.103
No, just that front one.

15:49.147 --> 15:50.930
But you did have the book press.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.752
That is the book press.

15:52.772 --> 15:53.894
I had about five of them.

15:54.074 --> 15:57.119
I had one you could sit down in it like a desk, and it had a drawer.

15:57.139 --> 15:57.900
He stole that.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.662
Now, where is that book press?

15:59.702 --> 16:00.904
Was that a working book press?

16:00.924 --> 16:01.605
You used that?

16:02.108 --> 16:03.230
No, I used them all.

16:03.691 --> 16:08.920
You get a book, and you can stitch the back.

16:08.980 --> 16:12.005
Keep your flashlight on there, and I'll take a picture just so I can focus on it.

16:16.974 --> 16:20.560
How about a picture of you showing the flashlight on the book press?

16:22.043 --> 16:22.684
Just like that.

16:25.168 --> 16:25.669
Just like that.

16:29.986 --> 16:33.810
Here's a wood block I made when I was in high school.

16:34.531 --> 16:36.112
What's this here, Steve, by the way?

16:36.132 --> 16:37.233
Oh, that's just nothing.

16:37.253 --> 16:37.594
Okay.

16:37.614 --> 16:39.155
A wood block you made in high school, right?

16:39.315 --> 16:39.876
Yeah.

16:40.056 --> 16:41.137
Oh, that's beautiful.

16:43.239 --> 16:44.361
How come they didn't take that?

16:44.461 --> 16:46.423
I don't know.

16:46.443 --> 16:47.384
That's lovely.

16:50.106 --> 16:50.987
You made the wood block?

16:51.007 --> 16:51.868
I mean, you drew the picture?

16:52.309 --> 16:53.910
Yeah, I carved it out of linoleum.

16:54.351 --> 16:58.575
A linoleum block, like, and then, you know, used it as a

17:01.120 --> 17:02.841
And you pulled images from this?

17:02.962 --> 17:03.682
Or is that an image?

17:03.702 --> 17:04.283
That's an image.

17:04.703 --> 17:05.784
Do you have any more of these?

17:05.804 --> 17:06.364
Is that it?

17:06.385 --> 17:07.225
Uh-huh, that's it.

17:08.386 --> 17:08.987
That's beautiful.

17:09.687 --> 17:10.288
Did you sign it?

17:11.689 --> 17:15.492
I don't think so.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.954
You want that as a memento?

17:17.034 --> 17:17.754
I'd love it.

17:17.814 --> 17:18.395
I'll frame it.

17:18.815 --> 17:19.256
All right.

17:19.276 --> 17:19.896
I'll treasure it.

17:20.356 --> 17:20.557
All right.

17:20.857 --> 17:23.739
Will you sign it for me before we part company?

17:23.759 --> 17:24.820
That's the only one I got.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.062
I remember I did that in 1965.

17:27.402 --> 17:28.583
Could you sign it someplace?

17:28.603 --> 17:28.884
Sure.

17:28.924 --> 17:29.805
Conscribe it to me.

17:29.965 --> 17:30.385
All right.

17:32.896 --> 17:33.777
I have the passion.

17:33.797 --> 17:36.300
See, they left some of my Victrola records, luckily.

17:37.662 --> 17:40.966
But I had, the records were out here in these milk crates.

17:41.146 --> 17:45.452
I had, these were all old record companies, recording company stock catalogs.

17:45.972 --> 17:49.356
Because I had like a run of Victor, Columbia, Pathé, Edison.

17:49.637 --> 17:50.518
Excuse me.

17:51.860 --> 17:52.360
What's that?

17:55.324 --> 17:55.845
Pacific Pastor.

17:55.865 --> 17:58.227
That's something I must have got out of California.

17:58.248 --> 17:59.489
I don't know what it is.

17:59.509 --> 18:00.270
It looks different.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.101
The records are nice.

18:07.722 --> 18:08.383
Yeah.

18:08.403 --> 18:09.524
Now, where are your records?

18:10.465 --> 18:11.586
Well, most of them are in the warehouse.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.949
Yeah, but those don't belong to the feds.

18:14.950 --> 18:16.292
They don't have any right to them, do they?

18:16.652 --> 18:17.513
Well, no, they're in mine.

18:17.533 --> 18:18.254
I've got a warehouse.

18:18.354 --> 18:19.696
Oh, your warehouse.

18:19.716 --> 18:21.178
Oh, your warehouse.

18:21.198 --> 18:27.285
These are old Edisons.

18:27.385 --> 18:29.287
I've got enough records now at the warehouse.

18:29.327 --> 18:30.649
I could fill this up with records.

18:31.149 --> 18:31.810
This house, you mean?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.873
Well, where they took the books.

18:34.014 --> 18:35.735
Oh, look at that.

18:35.775 --> 18:39.619
I had the original machines for them.

18:40.559 --> 18:43.462
This was the music room here.

18:43.482 --> 18:44.903
This was the music room?

18:44.963 --> 18:56.974
Yeah, I had a line of Victrolas here, those horn Victrolas.

18:56.994 --> 19:01.678
But the feds grabbed all the Victrolas.

19:02.198 --> 19:02.719
Yeah.

19:02.739 --> 19:03.219
What's that?

19:03.259 --> 19:04.340
Is that a chain or something?

19:04.701 --> 19:04.961
What?

19:05.482 --> 19:06.883
Oh, we're just left with a radio.

19:06.903 --> 19:08.605
No, it's a curtain.

19:10.207 --> 19:12.290
She grabs a chandelier out of here.

19:12.310 --> 19:21.100
She said when we were coming down, when we get to a friend of Otumwa, we'd be looking at the skeleton of my life.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.301
Is that your metaphor?

19:23.763 --> 19:23.863
Yeah.

19:23.963 --> 19:24.504
Yeah.

19:24.524 --> 19:28.389
Would you just elaborate on that just a bit?

19:28.409 --> 19:29.990
Is this the skeleton of your life?

19:30.010 --> 19:31.412
Yeah, I agree so.

19:32.742 --> 19:37.026
Well, I lost my old house on Elliott.

19:37.106 --> 19:40.469
I had a house in Minneapolis, a 36-room house.

19:40.489 --> 19:54.481
I had a 36-room house in Minneapolis that the city of Minneapolis wanted people out of, you know, I had roomers in there that they wanted us all out of there for redevelopment and that.

19:54.501 --> 20:02.428
And so I lived in warehouse after warehouse, finally got down here and got a house back in a proper setting to put this stuff in, and now it's

20:02.948 --> 20:08.074
You know, 20 years worth of work and knowledge and accumulation is just stripped out.

20:08.134 --> 20:09.215
It's just bare, you know.

20:09.275 --> 20:15.241
It's just a shell of what was contained here.

20:15.261 --> 20:18.084
How many floors had room, uh, had books in them?

20:19.005 --> 20:20.707
Mostly on this floor.

20:20.827 --> 20:23.110
Look at that.

20:23.130 --> 20:23.931
Isn't that super?

20:24.531 --> 20:25.412
Did you make that?

20:25.432 --> 20:28.796
No, no, no, that's empty.

20:28.816 --> 20:31.639
Put that up some place.

20:32.007 --> 20:37.493
I have books stored up here, but this is sort of a sorting area.

20:37.513 --> 20:38.935
We're going into the attic now.

20:39.876 --> 20:41.217
And you said it was a sorting area?

20:44.241 --> 20:44.401
Yeah.

20:44.441 --> 20:45.302
For new materials.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.906
Well, materials I was taking out of storage.

20:49.026 --> 20:49.667
Oh, jeez.

20:49.687 --> 20:50.227
Are you all right?

20:50.468 --> 20:53.631
How about you?

20:53.651 --> 20:53.751
Okay.

20:54.192 --> 20:54.813
Look at that.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.397
There isn't much up here.

20:58.697 --> 20:58.757
No.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.582
Any books laying on you?

21:01.622 --> 21:04.225
There's a good deal of the towel through the scuttle hole.

21:04.446 --> 21:05.767
Oh, I'll pass on that.

21:06.168 --> 21:07.750
Do you want to look at the towel, Adam?

21:08.571 --> 21:11.615
Yeah, I think it would work.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.297
Just come on by me.

21:13.317 --> 21:14.179
I'm going to go downstairs.

21:15.701 --> 21:18.605
There's some glass-gauge water now.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.826
Now we've got some light here.

21:20.407 --> 21:22.650
Yeah, all right.

21:22.670 --> 21:25.914
See, I've got to put this cresting up on the porch roof.

21:25.934 --> 21:26.295
Wow.

21:28.598 --> 21:30.060
What's that, like an old cabinet?

21:30.648 --> 21:31.929
Yeah, those are old.

21:31.989 --> 21:33.031
Give me a good buy, Adam.

21:33.131 --> 21:35.433
I'm going to go down.

21:35.453 --> 21:38.957
Look at the old jewelry cap through there, son.

21:39.117 --> 21:49.669
I had a lot of jewelry in there, too.

21:52.172 --> 21:52.733
Jewelry?

21:53.253 --> 21:54.254
Yeah, antique jewelry in a lot of years.

21:54.274 --> 21:58.219
Well... You think I'm on the other ranks of the book collectors, huh?

21:58.239 --> 21:59.440
Well, I know you're going to...

22:00.314 --> 22:01.716
be prominent in my book.

22:02.076 --> 22:05.261
And my book is going to be the book about book collecting for the 1990s.

22:05.381 --> 22:07.924
It's going to be published by Random House.

22:08.064 --> 22:08.545
Did you know that?

22:08.565 --> 22:08.845
Yeah.

22:09.306 --> 22:10.688
Oh, I didn't know it was published by.

22:10.708 --> 22:11.970
Random House is publishing it.

22:12.170 --> 22:17.477
And Vintage will be doing a paperback a year after the hardcover.

22:17.497 --> 22:19.540
And we'll be imprinting.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.243
You going to send us a book?

22:22.644 --> 22:25.508
Stephen will get an inscribed copy.

22:27.731 --> 22:29.393
And do you know what they did?

22:29.862 --> 22:32.346
Jenkins was not in.

22:32.366 --> 22:33.468
He had this plush office.

22:33.488 --> 22:34.930
This was before he had that fire.

22:36.312 --> 22:41.460
And Parrish just took me in his office and in his vault and said, just spend the day.

22:41.581 --> 22:42.782
And I just spent the afternoon.

22:42.802 --> 22:43.403
Did you really?

22:43.804 --> 22:44.986
Yeah.

22:45.006 --> 22:46.308
Parrish is an interesting character.

22:46.328 --> 22:48.892
Have you heard of Skeet Willingham of Georgia?

22:49.313 --> 22:53.099
That's the story we'll talk about.

22:55.883 --> 22:56.765
It's awful nice, Steve.

22:56.785 --> 22:57.085
Thank you.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.094
Did you have a name for this?

23:01.056 --> 23:03.079
Oh, it says it was a house in Illinois.

23:03.339 --> 23:04.982
That's a picture of a place in Illinois.

23:05.002 --> 23:05.763
But you did that.

23:06.003 --> 23:07.065
Yeah, when I was 16.

23:07.085 --> 23:07.205
Yes.

23:07.886 --> 23:17.400
Do you think you'll get that stained glass one back?

23:17.780 --> 23:20.304
No?

23:20.925 --> 23:24.049
That one was yours, right?

23:25.031 --> 23:25.131
Yeah.

23:26.309 --> 23:39.806
That's kind of the question I had earlier, yeah.

23:39.826 --> 23:49.799
You know, already, uh, even if they, when they go through there and go through Melbourne, the mass percentage of them are, you know.

23:50.259 --> 23:52.502
You think 10,000 at least would come back?

23:56.110 --> 24:03.724
Well, I don't know, because there's a percentage of that stuff that's ex-leepers discard type of stuff, you know.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.187
They're not always marked.

24:05.427 --> 24:07.491
That you picked up at flea markets in place.

24:07.511 --> 24:07.611
Yeah.

24:07.631 --> 24:08.533
Well, from dealers.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.136
I bought them in Cincinnati.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.903
You were in business in Texas, too, right?

24:13.943 --> 24:14.063
Yeah.

24:14.123 --> 24:15.065
Did you ever sell a place down there?

24:15.085 --> 24:15.826
Do you still have a place down there?

24:15.846 --> 24:16.127
Yeah, yeah.

24:16.147 --> 24:16.768
That's full of stuff.

24:21.710 --> 24:30.741
I used to know a guy in Minneapolis named Clark Hansen that got thousands of ex-Lieber's books and sold them.

24:30.761 --> 24:35.927
I bought off them for years.

24:35.947 --> 24:39.591
Well, how do you feel in here?

24:40.032 --> 24:40.753
I'm impressed.

24:40.773 --> 24:43.116
He stole the doorknob off the door, too.

24:44.117 --> 24:49.183
It's not a bad old wallpaper, huh?

24:49.203 --> 24:50.905
Oh, it's probably from the 50s.

24:50.925 --> 24:51.025
Yeah.

24:55.156 --> 24:59.240
Well, you think this is one of those final times you'll probably be in here?

24:59.260 --> 25:04.286
Yeah, if I give him some time, who's going to take care of the place?

25:04.366 --> 25:08.430
But I mean, even in the good case, you think you'd want to stay here?

25:08.491 --> 25:09.632
Oh, yeah, I'll stay here.

25:10.773 --> 25:11.494
Do you like the town?

25:11.994 --> 25:13.156
Yeah, this is all I got.

25:13.696 --> 25:16.639
You can't get a house like this for $16,000 if you place out.

25:18.582 --> 25:21.345
It is quite a nice place, isn't it?

25:21.365 --> 25:21.465
Yeah.

25:21.505 --> 25:24.488
My property goes all the way up to that building.

25:25.868 --> 25:30.273
Do you sense any resentment in the town, in the people in the town?

25:30.293 --> 25:32.115
No, I haven't so far found any.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.217
Did you know people around town?

25:35.799 --> 25:36.940
A few, not too many.

25:36.980 --> 25:39.342
Just that young fella, Carl.

25:39.763 --> 25:45.549
He really didn't have access here.

25:45.569 --> 25:47.151
What was he doing up here?

25:47.171 --> 25:48.472
You mean this is after?

25:49.653 --> 25:51.716
Before they got the search warrant.

25:51.896 --> 25:53.918
He'd come up and pillage through.

25:54.168 --> 25:59.514
What do you think the house was, Stephen?

26:00.135 --> 26:13.551
It's going to be 4,000, huh?

26:13.732 --> 26:20.019
No, there was a light on there.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.302
Grass light come up.

26:22.552 --> 26:26.797
Oh, that's from another stairway.

26:34.165 --> 26:38.670
Let him come, you know, in.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.913
He has to take him in and try to take care of him and that.

26:41.953 --> 26:45.637
And here he's got a bath in his room and he goes and turns you into the FBI.

26:45.657 --> 26:46.338
Sets you up.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.162
Pretty sleazy, isn't it?

26:54.175 --> 27:01.203
Then when he leaves, steals all the light fixtures.

27:02.045 --> 27:05.128
Yeah.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.910
Done their investigation.

27:07.151 --> 27:10.695
Huh?

27:10.755 --> 27:11.476
What's that?

27:12.597 --> 27:14.600
What is that?

27:14.620 --> 27:16.101
Fireplace panel.

27:16.122 --> 27:17.423
It's a fireplace what?

27:18.164 --> 27:19.586
Okay, that's wood?

27:19.746 --> 27:20.947
Yeah.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.970
And that was in an abandoned building in Cincinnati.

27:22.990 --> 27:23.170
Yeah.

27:25.462 --> 27:27.605
You know what I'm looking at, Steve?

27:27.625 --> 27:31.269
They must have sold them in the novelty store by the university.

27:31.449 --> 27:38.558
Yeah, but it's a... It looks like a brass copy of the seal of Cornell University.

27:39.078 --> 27:41.501
And you have another one over there for Pennsylvania.

27:42.122 --> 27:42.983
Oh, it's Penn State?

27:43.003 --> 27:43.203
Yeah.

27:44.325 --> 27:46.167
Are these places that you visited in your travels?

27:46.768 --> 27:47.468
Oh, I've been there.

27:47.889 --> 27:50.092
You have?

27:50.112 --> 27:52.154
Yeah.

27:52.174 --> 27:53.636
But I mean, so they were useful to you.

27:54.617 --> 27:55.418
Well, sort of...

27:56.056 --> 27:57.197
mementos, you know.

27:58.518 --> 28:01.702
But is that the same seal that you see on the book plates or something?

28:01.742 --> 28:02.723
I don't know if it is or not.

28:03.283 --> 28:05.145
Oh, but they're mementos of your visits.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.406
Yeah, but I didn't get them there.

28:07.127 --> 28:07.587
I see.

28:07.688 --> 28:08.989
I'm not getting it.

28:09.009 --> 28:15.756
You know, if I visited a place and I pick up, I'll buy something that's from the place.

28:15.776 --> 28:18.638
You know, you couldn't have got this for $5 in Ithaca, New York.

28:18.658 --> 28:20.360
Of course not, yeah.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.321
That'd be a bad time.

28:26.195 --> 28:26.696
Wow.

28:26.716 --> 28:29.159
Look at all these little short stories books.

28:29.179 --> 28:31.322
Yeah, those are the little out of their library.

28:31.362 --> 28:34.206
They came out in the 20s.

28:34.286 --> 28:45.942
The Phantom, Saw, Wolf, Will O'Donnell, Coming of Arthur, Essays, 50 of the best.

28:46.782 --> 28:49.104
A lot about somebody just by their trash.

28:49.245 --> 28:50.646
A lot of valuable stuff.

28:50.666 --> 28:53.128
And that's not against the law to go through something.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.531
You said you normally go through dumpsters often?

28:55.811 --> 28:56.532
Oh, all the time.

28:56.612 --> 29:03.279
You can learn as much about a person almost by their trash as talking to them.

29:03.339 --> 29:04.660
And that's how you got Clifford stuff?

29:05.281 --> 29:05.381
Yeah.

29:05.401 --> 29:06.682
Where was this out in California?

29:06.702 --> 29:07.944
On the front sidewalk, yeah.

29:11.147 --> 29:14.010
So all this stuff about sending people in the house is baloney.

29:14.090 --> 29:14.190
Yeah.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.849
That didn't sound like you.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.033
That was bad testimony there, by the way.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.835
I was very disturbed by that.

29:23.855 --> 29:26.299
I don't think you've got any keys to work on that box.

29:28.062 --> 29:28.763
Well, we'll see.

29:28.843 --> 29:31.367
They fed shays, I'll tell you that real quick.

29:31.387 --> 29:32.468
We'll see.

29:32.488 --> 29:33.230
More than once.

29:35.192 --> 29:38.878
If I go by there and kind of look at the post office to get a money order, I'd go by there.

29:39.432 --> 29:44.277
So now, like now, were you just doing this out of habit?

29:44.297 --> 29:45.298
Uh, I don't know.

29:45.318 --> 29:47.340
I didn't get a chance to read these.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.703
I just like to... You like paper.

29:52.245 --> 29:55.508
I mean, you're interested in... Well, where were we just now, by the way?

29:55.528 --> 29:56.769
At the Otama High School.

29:57.270 --> 29:59.131
Uh-huh.

29:59.151 --> 29:59.252
Yeah.

29:59.272 --> 30:02.375
And what do you think could have been a value in there, or of interest?

30:02.555 --> 30:03.696
Well, okay.

30:03.816 --> 30:04.937
I'll give you a scenario.

30:04.977 --> 30:05.778
See this thing here?

30:06.118 --> 30:08.240
Yeah.

30:08.261 --> 30:08.781
What is it?

30:09.082 --> 30:15.369
a parent or legal guardian permission to attend Central College.

30:15.449 --> 30:17.472
Oh, I thought this was an absence excuse.

30:18.833 --> 30:19.674
So what if it was?

30:19.774 --> 30:22.718
OK, well, OK, let's say it's an absence excuse.

30:23.178 --> 30:30.527
And Adam's from Ottumwa, and he needs an excuse to get out of school or something.

30:31.508 --> 30:32.269
Do it right up.

30:36.493 --> 30:37.975
I get you.

30:41.228 --> 30:44.092
Thanks for that one, Steve.

30:44.933 --> 30:50.081
You're always investigating, yeah.

30:50.101 --> 31:07.185
I used to go in the Goodwill box, take off my dirty clothes and leave them in there and just put on some clean ones and pop out.

31:08.853 --> 31:12.837
Don't ever say no sock of penis anymore, do you?

31:12.877 --> 31:13.298
I have them.

31:13.318 --> 31:16.721
I still got some of them.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.563
You used to get your clothes from Goodwill Road?

31:18.723 --> 31:19.004
Oh, yeah.

31:19.024 --> 31:20.025
From the Dropbox.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.386
You know, I just take off a dirty shirt.

31:26.992 --> 31:27.673
So, let's see.

31:27.693 --> 31:28.834
There's the post office.

31:28.894 --> 31:30.936
We're going to hang a left on Packard Ave.

31:34.620 --> 31:38.404
Yeah, I drop by here, you know, every time I drop the post office.

31:38.570 --> 31:41.121
I'm going to back down to the area of your place.

32:10.649 --> 32:19.222
How good are your eyes?

32:19.283 --> 32:23.129
Is that thing moving?

32:23.710 --> 32:25.052
Turn to turn?

32:27.375 --> 32:28.437
Yeah.

32:28.457 --> 32:29.479
OK.

32:29.519 --> 32:31.021
That's nice.

32:31.061 --> 32:33.585
That's a fine press printer.

32:34.342 --> 32:36.084
So why didn't they take these on you?

32:36.104 --> 32:51.500
Oh, I don't know.

32:53.482 --> 33:00.830
That means I got to rewind.

33:01.010 --> 33:02.492
That's the problem.

33:02.540 --> 33:06.766
I'm not telling them anything.

33:06.826 --> 33:09.009
I'm not even telling them I was with you.

33:10.391 --> 33:10.771
You know?

33:13.235 --> 33:14.917
It's between you and me.

33:15.518 --> 33:19.543
If you want to tell them it's your business, but I don't tell my business to other people.

33:20.985 --> 33:21.686
Does that make sense?

33:26.874 --> 33:30.859
Those are beautiful, Stephen.

33:34.417 --> 33:38.922
Do you remember these?

33:38.962 --> 33:40.024
No.

33:40.304 --> 33:42.467
Look, don't you think they came in here?

33:42.507 --> 33:45.470
Sure they would, but it was our books.

33:45.670 --> 33:47.993
So I wanted to be those, I wonder.

33:54.161 --> 34:00.328
I don't know.

34:00.348 --> 34:02.871
Here, Adam.

34:03.374 --> 34:23.465
Just discovered your Mexican books, you said?

34:23.485 --> 34:25.027
Yeah.

34:25.047 --> 34:25.568
And what else?

34:31.690 --> 34:34.073
Political dictionary.

34:34.093 --> 34:54.557
Some of these are pretty old books too, aren't they?

34:56.619 --> 34:58.481
Yeah, these were the bottom of my architecture.

35:00.524 --> 35:01.545
These were what?

35:01.694 --> 35:04.617
These would have gone in the architecture case.

35:05.658 --> 35:07.039
They weren't there yet, they were here.

35:07.119 --> 35:09.781
No, they were in storage here.

35:13.284 --> 35:23.093
I have a lot of stuff in storage.

35:24.635 --> 35:29.659
See, I had windows stacked up like this in the house and he ripped them off.

35:30.955 --> 36:00.068
I'll bet you there are a few good tomes packed away here and there.

36:00.672 --> 36:10.263
What's that?

36:11.184 --> 36:14.728
My accumulations overwhelmed them.

36:14.788 --> 36:18.732
They couldn't get it all.

36:20.334 --> 36:21.555
These are coins.

36:22.176 --> 36:27.642
Well, that's one of those big old dictionaries that they used to have.

36:27.858 --> 36:33.965
Oh, who knows?

36:34.006 --> 36:39.612
These are records.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.302
Does all this stuff have a purpose, Stephen?

36:48.824 --> 36:53.990
Well, I used to sell it and use it to fix up the house, you know?

36:54.130 --> 36:57.274
There's light pictures.

36:59.279 --> 37:07.930
That looks like a hairy trench coat then.

37:07.950 --> 37:10.012
You think what they left behind the house, huh?

37:10.313 --> 37:11.594
Jeez, huh?

37:11.614 --> 37:12.616
What are the 78 records?

37:12.636 --> 37:14.037
Well, how long is that?

37:14.097 --> 37:17.902
What are these?

37:17.922 --> 37:19.444
What do you call these things here?

37:19.504 --> 37:20.746
Chimney pots.

37:20.826 --> 37:21.427
Chimney pots?

37:21.647 --> 37:22.428
Yeah.

37:22.728 --> 37:24.290
What's your federal license plate?

37:26.933 --> 37:27.254
Oh, my God.

37:27.274 --> 37:28.155
That's all money.

37:28.736 --> 37:29.016
Yep.

37:29.873 --> 37:30.734
I just found that.

37:31.735 --> 37:33.697
You heard me over here talking?

37:33.777 --> 37:35.859
Kenny wouldn't have left that one behind, would he?

37:35.879 --> 37:39.663
I had suitcases like this full of money at the house, too.

37:40.844 --> 37:41.945
All full of pennies.

37:41.965 --> 37:45.068
Wheat pennies.

37:45.109 --> 37:46.190
Wheat pennies.

37:46.250 --> 37:46.670
Wheat?

37:46.770 --> 37:48.092
Oh, Wheaties.

37:48.832 --> 37:49.973
Yeah, I thought of Wheaties.

37:49.994 --> 37:52.916
Yeah, these are Wheaties.

37:52.937 --> 37:53.017
Huh?

37:53.037 --> 37:53.497
How's that?

37:53.517 --> 37:54.919
What do them Wheat pennies look like?

37:55.539 --> 37:56.840
What did you say, sir?

37:56.921 --> 37:59.123
I was just going to tell you.

37:59.143 --> 37:59.323
Oh, OK.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.226
What do they look like?

38:04.807 --> 38:08.713
I didn't see them.

38:08.733 --> 38:10.937
Steve, is this the first time you've been here since your arrest?

38:10.977 --> 38:11.237
Yep.

38:16.425 --> 38:17.647
Were there books in here too?

38:18.248 --> 38:24.277
Yeah, on that blank space, there was all... And they're gone, of course.

38:26.060 --> 38:27.302
I've seen Indian...

38:27.535 --> 38:29.458
Yeah, see?

38:30.139 --> 38:33.924
That's an old penny.

38:37.369 --> 38:40.513
I have jars and jars of these things.

38:40.533 --> 38:42.055
Let me get a picture, huh?

38:42.075 --> 38:45.260
I just want to get a picture of Steve.

38:45.460 --> 38:49.926
Can you stop yourself?

38:49.946 --> 38:53.331
Say again, this is the stuff that you collected?

38:53.411 --> 38:56.295
Oh, you've got some here.

38:56.315 --> 38:57.036
Excuse me, sir.

39:00.053 --> 39:02.355
That's my catalog, Ed.

39:02.675 --> 39:07.220
This is beautiful.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.000
This is St.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.342
Johnsbury, Vermont.

39:12.845 --> 39:16.108
I brought these from the Newton Rockwood estate in Minneapolis.

39:16.128 --> 39:17.909
I recognized his handwriting in there.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.673
See all these photos of buildings and them?

39:21.693 --> 39:24.035
See, that was the main thing I was into.

39:25.416 --> 39:26.317
You mean the other days?

39:26.878 --> 39:28.259
Yeah.

39:28.279 --> 39:29.520
That's in my neck of the woods.

39:30.412 --> 39:32.435
I work about 20 miles from Fitchburg.

39:37.883 --> 39:38.684
Hey, Steve.

39:38.704 --> 39:39.044
Yeah?

39:41.488 --> 39:42.409
Oh, let me see it.

39:45.433 --> 39:49.679
James Gordon Bennett.

39:49.699 --> 39:51.822
The old thing still works.

39:51.842 --> 39:52.303
Let's see it.

39:54.105 --> 39:57.270
Oh, yeah, you can take that if you want.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.473
This looks just like the one my dad used to have.

40:00.027 --> 40:01.409
With the deer on it.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.150
Shogs.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.251
Oh, that's gorgeous.

40:03.271 --> 40:05.094
Mr. Pittsfield, New Hampshire.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.235
It still works.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.597
That's a beautiful binder.

40:07.617 --> 40:09.260
Look at them have them on there.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.443
That should have the name of the binder on it.

40:11.563 --> 40:18.512
Actually, now it's only about 40, you know.

40:19.000 --> 40:27.000
[Items shuffled around.]

40:27.985 --> 40:28.085
Yeah.

40:28.105 --> 40:29.427
Look at these books, Steve.

40:29.592 --> 40:37.563
Blast, man, being here all day, looking at everything.

40:37.683 --> 40:38.044
Uh-oh.

40:38.064 --> 40:38.184
$35.

40:38.204 --> 40:44.152
Come and play strip of Richard Platt.

40:44.272 --> 40:48.658
Yeah, sure is.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.322
What is it, a sound history?

40:51.822 --> 40:55.127
Yeah, a regional history.

40:55.883 --> 40:59.648
Oh, look at that, a pre-fire Chicago imprint.

41:00.028 --> 41:00.729
That's very good.

41:01.190 --> 41:04.454
Genealogy and ecclesiastical history.

41:04.834 --> 41:08.098
Genealogy, comma, and ecclesiastical history.

41:08.879 --> 41:09.680
Does it have an author?

41:10.982 --> 41:15.247
Alfred Andrews, Chicago N.I., 1867.

41:15.608 --> 41:17.530
Now, Brad.

41:19.312 --> 41:20.794
See, these aren't ex-Lebers.

41:28.148 --> 41:48.807
It's here in the state of New Hampshire. They got all my local stuff and I'm going to be stuck with all New England stuff. That's not funny. I'm sorry. Midwestern you mean. Yeah i'd rather the Midwestern stuff than this stuff.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.325
Chief of the Pilgrims.

42:00.627 --> 42:01.548
This is all New England.

42:02.009 --> 42:04.272
And for God's sakes, don't tell them there's any books in here.

42:04.292 --> 42:05.434
They'll come and take everything.

42:05.454 --> 42:07.196
I'm not going to tell them a damn thing.

42:08.158 --> 42:10.140
Don't you tell them you were with me today.

42:10.160 --> 42:13.165
You can tell them what you want, but I mean, I'm not going to.

42:13.225 --> 42:22.759
We're going to resurrect the Bloomberg Library again, huh?

42:22.779 --> 42:24.721
We're going to resurrect the Bloomberg Library.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.265
That's funny.

42:28.088 --> 42:29.189
You think so?

42:29.209 --> 42:30.531
Is it going to rise from the ashes?

42:30.791 --> 42:31.271
Oh, I hope so.

42:35.896 --> 42:39.140
But this time you're going to require differently, right?

42:39.680 --> 42:40.241
Yeah.

42:40.261 --> 42:41.362
Well, these were required.

42:42.403 --> 42:43.304
Improbably.

42:45.327 --> 42:48.430
That's Maine.

42:48.450 --> 42:49.631
That's Hartley, Connecticut.

42:51.794 --> 42:53.115
No, this is on Maine.

42:53.255 --> 42:54.096
Crestile Maine?

42:54.869 --> 42:55.870
You know, picturesque.

42:56.311 --> 42:57.212
Oh, picturesque.

42:57.392 --> 42:58.073
I'm sorry.

42:58.093 --> 42:59.094
There is a Prescott.

42:59.114 --> 42:59.555
Yeah, I know.

42:59.575 --> 43:00.476
There's Portland.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.002
These are pretty nice, you know.

43:05.022 --> 43:06.644
These are very, very desirable.

43:07.165 --> 43:08.266
Yeah, I know.

43:08.306 --> 43:11.030
I've seen them go at regional auctions at pretty good places.

43:12.151 --> 43:13.453
People love regional histories.

43:14.053 --> 43:17.918
Yeah, and you can see there isn't a big percentage of them that are bad, you know.

43:19.641 --> 43:21.403
Are you happy to see them here?

43:21.423 --> 43:22.905
Well, a few of them, yeah.

43:23.205 --> 43:24.707
What's left?

43:25.345 --> 43:28.508
But I mean, are you pleased to see that there was something left of your library?

43:28.588 --> 43:31.571
Yeah.

43:31.591 --> 43:34.454
I'm acting like a true big bibliomaniac, ain't I?

43:34.955 --> 43:36.376
You are, aren't you?

43:36.396 --> 43:36.496
Yeah.

43:36.516 --> 43:38.178
What are you doing right now in your mind?

43:38.218 --> 43:41.021
Well, I'm trying to put these back together.

43:41.822 --> 43:44.224
You're looking to see what you've got left.

43:44.244 --> 43:49.850
Yeah.

43:49.870 --> 43:51.231
They left you a couple hundred books.

43:51.592 --> 43:54.795
Isn't that nice of them?

43:57.155 --> 44:05.114
Where's your limo, Steve?

44:06.477 --> 44:07.038
Oh, yeah.

44:09.203 --> 44:11.569
Don't let them know.

44:13.085 --> 44:17.391
Now these doors, you take these to antique shows?

44:17.411 --> 44:19.293
Yeah.

44:19.313 --> 44:20.955
You did Grimfield, huh?

44:21.036 --> 44:21.736
Yeah, I used to do Grimfield.

44:21.756 --> 44:22.638
That's a great place.

44:22.658 --> 44:24.901
Well, I only live about 20 miles from Grimfield.

44:24.981 --> 44:25.381
Oh, you do, huh?

44:25.642 --> 44:27.324
Yeah, I used to set up Quaker's Acres.

44:28.085 --> 44:30.128
Yeah, that's the best free market in America.

44:30.148 --> 44:30.548
It is.

44:32.791 --> 44:34.493
I got a typewriter out of there one year.

44:34.553 --> 44:35.755
It's absolutely wonderful.

44:37.938 --> 44:40.341
It's got its original wooden case.

44:45.367 --> 45:00.041
See, I didn't know all what I had in here myself.

45:00.061 --> 45:07.108
Kentucky Bicentennial.

45:07.128 --> 45:09.410
Books on Mexico, catalog number.

45:09.450 --> 45:12.133
That's an auction.

45:12.383 --> 45:14.485
That's a nice old door, huh?

45:14.645 --> 45:15.426
That wouldn't work on it.

45:15.907 --> 45:17.849
This is my camera catwalk.

45:17.889 --> 45:24.156
I'm going to step out here, OK?

45:24.196 --> 45:24.977
Are you enjoying this?

45:25.157 --> 45:35.609
Yeah.

45:37.771 --> 45:37.851
Wow.

45:43.552 --> 45:45.174
Where do you get all your cardboard boxes?

45:46.676 --> 45:57.591
I buy them from box companies or I'll go into the dumpsters and get them.

45:57.611 --> 45:58.753
What's this old thing here?

45:59.514 --> 46:01.536
Nice old matchbook.

46:01.556 --> 46:02.337
Oh, matchbook.

46:02.818 --> 46:04.100
I collected matchbooks.

46:05.021 --> 46:07.725
In the old days, I don't anymore.

46:07.745 --> 46:08.826
But places are old.

46:09.087 --> 46:10.909
Yeah, can I just take a look over your shoulder?

46:13.015 --> 46:16.338
Oh, that's nice.

46:16.358 --> 46:19.020
Now, did you put this in the album, or is that the way you acquired it?

46:19.441 --> 46:21.343
There's an old copy of Rain of the Fox.

46:22.063 --> 46:22.844
That's very nice.

46:23.304 --> 46:24.065
Oh, that's sweet.

46:25.226 --> 46:26.107
That is sweet.

46:27.528 --> 46:28.549
Joseph Wolf.

46:28.609 --> 46:29.670
London, what's the date?

46:29.690 --> 46:30.011
1855.

46:30.471 --> 46:31.752
Nice.

46:31.932 --> 46:32.653
Very nice.

46:32.673 --> 46:36.857
I got a sense that they quit on you after a while.

46:36.897 --> 46:40.440
Yeah, yeah, that's too much for them.

46:44.757 --> 46:52.871
That's an appropriate book.

46:52.891 --> 46:55.154
Well, they left this much in the house, obviously.

46:56.897 --> 46:59.983
The house was cleaned out, wasn't it?

47:00.003 --> 47:01.705
Yeah.

47:01.725 --> 47:06.754
That's courtesy of the foreman.

47:06.874 --> 47:11.001
I always loved to read copies of Fortune magazine from the Depression.

47:12.179 --> 47:14.862
You could buy a Plymouth 6 for $445.

47:15.403 --> 47:19.768
Take a world cruise.

47:19.948 --> 47:20.849
This is a 1933.

47:20.929 --> 47:24.092
That's Fortune.

47:24.112 --> 47:24.913
That's the year.

47:25.033 --> 47:25.394
It's 1933?

47:25.554 --> 47:25.774
Yeah.

47:26.295 --> 47:41.612
The new Franklin Airman in smart style.

47:41.913 --> 47:45.377
You know, the Empire State Building was completed in New York City in 1931.

47:45.678 --> 47:47.861
My father was there when they were building it.

47:47.901 --> 47:51.706
He was, huh?

47:51.726 --> 47:55.871
Yeah, it's interesting reading Fortune magazine from the mid-30s.

47:55.891 --> 47:57.253
It's kind of an anachronism.

47:57.733 --> 47:58.334
It really is.

47:58.554 --> 47:58.875
Yeah.

47:59.155 --> 48:03.681
Because if you read it, you wouldn't realize it was a depression novel, either.

48:03.701 --> 48:03.981
You know?

48:04.762 --> 48:07.446
Everybody lives beautifully on the pages of Fortune magazine.

48:07.466 --> 48:07.566
Yeah.

48:11.022 --> 48:26.125
Well, a lot of my doorknobs are intact.

48:26.145 --> 48:27.407
That's a Crutzinger knob.

48:27.647 --> 48:28.308
Crutzinger?

48:28.729 --> 48:33.657
Yeah, it's by Metal Compact Casting Company.

48:33.697 --> 48:35.519
That's that one I told you in Boston.

48:35.540 --> 48:37.182
Oh, yeah, that's gorgeous, isn't it?

48:37.448 --> 48:38.910
one that may cast knobs.

48:39.191 --> 48:40.072
That's about 1869.

48:40.573 --> 48:47.144
See, there was a lot of this house and roads stole all this stuff.

48:53.775 --> 48:56.319
You ought to be able to file some charges against him.

48:56.339 --> 48:57.341
I already have.

48:58.803 --> 49:03.591
But you see, they have selective enforcement, and they won't prosecute him.

49:04.583 --> 49:07.006
Yeah, but you can still swear at a criminal complaint, can't you?

49:07.026 --> 49:14.215
Well, I have here a little tunnel, but it's like you say, he's exempt, you know?

49:14.715 --> 49:19.922
Well, maybe the feds say he's exempt, but you can look to the local cops and have to say he's exempt.

49:19.942 --> 49:22.545
Yeah, but he's never going to show his butt down here again.

49:22.565 --> 49:23.206
Yeah, he's gone.

49:23.226 --> 49:24.247
In fact, he's gone now.

49:28.472 --> 49:31.336
These are hurt.

49:31.356 --> 49:32.116
Oh, boy.

49:32.136 --> 49:32.757
Aren't those nice?

49:32.797 --> 49:33.638
Are those aqua tints?

49:34.039 --> 49:34.219
Huh?

49:34.452 --> 49:34.892
Hold this.

49:36.274 --> 49:37.095
Step back.

49:37.115 --> 49:50.930
Are those with those, you think?

49:51.190 --> 50:00.780
Yeah.

50:01.233 --> 50:10.443
Ah, nice.

50:11.905 --> 50:13.947
Wonderful.

50:14.128 --> 50:15.329
Look at that, hold it right there.

50:16.570 --> 50:28.524
Steven, just stay right there.

50:28.544 --> 50:29.485
Thanks.

50:30.224 --> 50:43.645
Oh, they didn't get it all, did they?

50:43.745 --> 50:44.847
What are these, Steve?

50:44.867 --> 50:47.310
I don't know, where's that out of?

50:47.451 --> 50:49.153
Lake City, that's south of Minneapolis.

50:49.193 --> 50:49.374
1882.

50:49.434 --> 50:52.138
Well, it's in beautiful condition.

50:54.021 --> 50:56.164
Oh, and a book of loose-bound newspapers.

51:01.173 --> 51:04.117
I'm surprised you've never been by the American Antiquarian Society.

51:05.179 --> 51:09.925
I was going to go there one time, but I think you've got to be a member to get in there, don't you?

51:09.945 --> 51:11.688
That's not true.

51:11.708 --> 51:12.649
I have a reading class there.

51:12.909 --> 51:13.891
Oh, you do, huh?

51:15.533 --> 51:16.234
Yeah.

51:16.535 --> 51:17.236
I've heard of that.

51:17.276 --> 51:18.037
I'm a reader there.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.098
I'm a reader at Houghton.

51:19.118 --> 51:20.059
I'm a reader at the Newbury.

51:20.660 --> 51:21.722
I'm a reader at the Huntington.

51:21.982 --> 51:23.164
I'm a reader at the British Library.

51:23.184 --> 51:24.085
The best, yeah.

51:24.145 --> 51:25.387
The Bodwellian, huh?

51:25.407 --> 51:26.008
The Bodleian.

51:26.168 --> 51:27.290
Bodleian, huh?

51:27.370 --> 51:28.311
That's at Oxford.

51:28.747 --> 51:29.568
Oh, yeah.

51:29.588 --> 51:30.629
I'm not a real problem.

51:30.989 --> 51:32.391
I've got a bit of slides where I am.

51:34.693 --> 51:37.176
Well, you're a real scholar, aren't you?

51:37.196 --> 51:37.396
Trying.

51:46.806 --> 51:51.150
Well, there are still some noble tomes in here.

51:52.272 --> 51:53.413
Buried someplace.

51:53.713 --> 51:55.615
Well, you have a few assets around here.

51:57.940 --> 52:01.444
Has Mr. Hall been in here before?

52:03.566 --> 52:20.123
What does it cost you to rent a price access, Steve?

52:20.303 --> 52:23.346
$200 a month?

52:23.366 --> 52:23.526
Yeah.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.799
How many square feet?

52:27.441 --> 52:30.945
That's a good size, huh?

52:30.965 --> 52:34.449
That's got to be 30 feet deep.

52:34.589 --> 52:39.115
I'd say you got six, seven, eight hundred square feet here at least.

52:40.417 --> 52:46.204
You think there's any chance I can get what I purchased back from the bastards?

52:46.384 --> 52:47.065
I would hope so.

52:47.185 --> 52:49.868
I mean, I would ask your lawyer to make those inquiries.

52:50.489 --> 52:55.475
Well, he says that I have to go through forfeiture, and they'll make it more expensive than it's worth.

52:55.915 --> 52:57.016
What do you mean forfeiture?

52:57.557 --> 53:01.501
Well, they seize your stuff, you know?

53:02.663 --> 53:03.003
Yeah.

53:03.283 --> 53:09.150
And you have to file legal access to get it, you know?

53:10.151 --> 53:13.655
Shaving stick, look at this.

53:16.838 --> 53:20.142
Well, I got a house to take this up to and sort it.

53:21.742 --> 53:37.604
They left proportionally about this much stuff in Minneapolis, too.

53:38.025 --> 53:39.066
Was that right?

53:39.086 --> 53:39.186
Yeah.

53:40.027 --> 53:50.702
And the house being the strip road, it's got all that material.

53:51.914 --> 53:54.598
Sash lifts.

53:54.618 --> 53:55.440
Whatever?

53:55.460 --> 53:56.521
Sash lifts.

53:56.582 --> 53:57.283
Sash?

53:57.403 --> 53:58.344
Sash?

53:58.665 --> 53:59.366
Yeah, window lifts.

53:59.767 --> 54:11.265
Oh, lifts, okay.

54:11.285 --> 54:16.514
This is the tape.

54:16.534 --> 54:19.238
I got a lot of drawing on these.

54:21.074 --> 54:26.502
Isn't that something?

54:26.642 --> 54:27.904
Oh, that's solid.

54:28.485 --> 54:29.927
Now, what did you call it?

54:29.947 --> 54:33.311
They were from the Russell Mellon Manufacturing Company in 1870.

54:34.413 --> 54:35.995
Where do you get these?

54:36.236 --> 54:38.359
Old buildings they were demolishing all years ago.

54:38.379 --> 54:39.600
You just could go in and get them?

54:40.281 --> 54:41.103
Yeah.

54:41.123 --> 54:41.703
Just like that.

54:42.985 --> 54:47.672
Well, I used to buy the salvage rights too, but years ago nobody even cared, you know?

54:49.171 --> 55:12.118
I wonder if he's got that type of stuff.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.301
Save it.

55:22.955 --> 55:29.587
Well, I got a lot of exploring I can do in here, don't I?

55:29.608 --> 55:34.677
Looks like, uh, music for a poem or something.

55:34.697 --> 55:36.280
Panoramas of Towns.

55:39.186 --> 55:40.388
Douglas, Arizona.

55:42.672 --> 55:43.714
D-O-U-G-L-A-S.

55:51.153 --> 55:53.296
I never expected that we do something like this.

55:53.376 --> 55:54.858
I'll be doing something like this today.

55:55.478 --> 55:56.540
Why is that?

55:56.560 --> 55:59.143
I just didn't know you'd call me.

55:59.243 --> 56:01.506
Rio Grande River Port Bliss, thank you.

56:01.526 --> 56:02.547
Yeah, this is great.

56:05.511 --> 56:07.814
They must have shot a number of exposures, huh?

56:07.874 --> 56:08.415
Yeah.

56:08.435 --> 56:13.461
And assumed them to go there or something.

56:13.481 --> 56:14.883
There's nothing new here, is there?

56:15.244 --> 56:15.444
No.

56:15.985 --> 56:17.026
Is that significant?

56:17.046 --> 56:18.868
Does that tell me something?

56:18.888 --> 56:19.489
Oh, I don't know.

56:21.612 --> 56:24.435
Well, it's stuff that's relative.

56:24.455 --> 56:26.338
It all has parts of stuff.

56:26.518 --> 56:30.743
Like this would fit in one of those fireplaces or in one of those houses.

56:31.003 --> 56:34.127
It all has its purpose, all this stuff.

56:34.147 --> 56:36.229
Well, it says Bakery, something Minnesota.

56:36.249 --> 56:39.033
Did you bring those big wooden things all the way down here from Minnesota?

56:39.053 --> 56:41.275
Oh, those are from Bates and Shoes down in the mall.

56:41.335 --> 56:42.537
I tore that block down.

56:43.037 --> 56:44.359
I used them for bookshelving.

56:44.379 --> 56:49.585
Yeah, I thought this has all been brought in.

56:49.625 --> 56:50.987
You brought this all down yourself?

56:51.047 --> 56:51.147
Yeah.

56:51.413 --> 56:53.837
Well, I have these young guys help me now.

56:54.498 --> 56:55.820
Not these particularly.

56:55.900 --> 56:57.783
Well, well, but I mean, how many trips would you say it took them?

56:57.803 --> 56:59.125
Well, 28 truckloads.

56:59.346 --> 57:00.287
28 truckloads.

57:00.307 --> 57:01.048
What size truck?

57:02.371 --> 57:03.673
Uh, 24-foot van.

57:03.693 --> 57:05.055
24-foot van.

57:06.076 --> 57:08.080
Look at these beautiful artworks.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.001
Aren't these nice?

57:09.021 --> 57:09.342
Mm-hmm.

57:09.442 --> 57:12.967
See, this is the quality of stuff that that son of a bitch stole out of the house.

57:13.869 --> 57:15.131
Jeez.

57:15.151 --> 57:17.174
I have, you know, thousands of houses.

57:17.194 --> 57:17.995
Oh, that is exquisite.

57:18.376 --> 57:18.957
You had what?

57:19.021 --> 57:22.384
Thousands and thousands of dollars worth of windows in there that they didn't see.

57:22.444 --> 57:27.729
They were wrapped with paper like this.

57:32.213 --> 57:32.913
Those are gorgeous.

57:32.933 --> 57:42.322
See, that was another one of my main collections of earth glass windows.

57:46.946 --> 57:48.387
Earth, sex, and sky.

57:52.568 --> 57:55.231
Well, are you moderately pleased to see as much as you're seeing?

57:55.972 --> 57:57.835
Yeah.

57:57.855 --> 58:01.759
I don't know how long it'll be here, though.

58:01.779 --> 58:02.200
What do you mean?

58:02.220 --> 58:02.821
This is yours?

58:03.662 --> 58:05.384
Well, yeah, I know it's mine, but I don't know.

58:05.404 --> 58:08.508
They may figure out it's here and come in here and take it all.

58:09.249 --> 58:09.970
They know it's here.

58:10.650 --> 58:11.171
They've been here.

58:11.491 --> 58:13.133
Now, what are all those suitcases, Stephen?

58:13.153 --> 58:14.595
There must be 100 suitcases.

58:16.057 --> 58:17.839
Well, I used to pack books in those.

58:17.859 --> 58:18.560
They don't crush.

58:18.800 --> 58:21.664
You know, go to the salary chart and buy them for a buck or a yard sale.

58:21.880 --> 58:23.763
Books and they're much better than boxes.

58:24.585 --> 58:25.907
And you can carry them.

58:30.515 --> 58:32.759
Yeah.

58:32.779 --> 58:34.382
No, I'm afraid of this.

58:35.103 --> 58:38.469
See, then they'll get a wild hair up their ass and come in here and take this stuff too.

58:38.489 --> 58:40.412
They want to clean me out, you know?

58:41.168 --> 58:42.270
What's this stuff?

58:42.410 --> 58:43.471
These are bottle caps.

58:43.852 --> 58:45.575
Yeah, I have the bottoms to them.

58:45.595 --> 58:46.796
I got them out of the drugstore.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.721
Well, why would you have a whole box of bottle caps?

58:49.901 --> 58:51.083
Well, I have the bottom of the box.

58:51.123 --> 58:53.266
A lot of the bottoms are somewhere in here, you know.

58:54.889 --> 58:57.092
Well, what's the collectible, not the cap?

58:58.173 --> 58:59.796
What is the collectible?

58:59.816 --> 59:02.680
They're all milk glass bottles with the fiery milk on them.

59:02.700 --> 59:05.324
I'd put them out of the free market and get a quarter piece for them.

59:05.344 --> 59:05.404
Oh.

59:05.705 --> 59:07.868
There must be a hundred dollars in there.

59:08.894 --> 59:12.818
I used to buy art and take contents to places.

59:12.838 --> 59:13.459
On block.

59:13.899 --> 59:14.460
Yeah.

59:14.700 --> 59:15.421
As they say.

59:15.621 --> 59:17.944
That's how Henry Huntington brought his books, on block.

59:21.047 --> 59:22.729
What's that?

59:22.749 --> 59:25.332
The County of Guilford, historic property.

59:25.412 --> 59:26.473
That would be New Hampshire.

59:26.833 --> 59:27.234
I guess.

59:27.574 --> 59:31.118
It's a bronze plaque.

59:33.861 --> 59:38.205
Oh, yeah.

59:38.225 --> 59:38.606
It's on Blackwood.

59:38.626 --> 59:38.766
Thanks.

59:40.045 --> 59:42.761
What did you call him?

59:42.882 --> 59:43.224
Store door.

59:43.264 --> 59:44.672
Search door handles.

01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:15.686
It would take you months to go through this place.

01:00:15.967 --> 01:00:17.609
Oh, these are the bottles?

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.974
No, these are door knobs and they're all door knobs.

01:00:21.916 --> 01:00:24.720
These plastic milk plastics.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.362
Yeah.

01:00:26.382 --> 01:00:28.005
That's Yeon Town.

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:36.978
There's all the catalogs and stuff from the company's manufacturing.

01:00:36.998 --> 01:00:37.579
Isn't that beautiful?

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:41.845
This is the kelp product, Yeon Town, and that's about 1890.

01:00:42.415 --> 01:01:01.493
These are all going up.

01:01:01.653 --> 01:01:08.980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:11.387
There's three boxes here.

01:01:11.808 --> 01:01:13.210
Not much more over here, too.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:28.655
These are all records for you.

01:01:34.385 --> 01:01:34.545
Come on.

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:43.106
This is from the Redding Harbor Company, Redding, Pennsylvania.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:44.327
Those are gorgeous, huh?

01:01:44.427 --> 01:01:44.527
Wow.

01:01:48.532 --> 01:01:49.713
You live in an old house?

01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:50.915
Not that old.

01:01:51.655 --> 01:01:52.977
Fifteen years old.

01:01:52.997 --> 01:01:54.899
We have a few antiques that we like.

01:01:55.059 --> 01:02:02.208
They're nothing like that.

01:02:02.408 --> 01:02:03.469
Clean or nothing?

01:02:03.736 --> 01:02:08.667
Thank you.

01:02:08.868 --> 01:02:13.579
That's kind of nice.

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.481
Well, what would you call this?

01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:15.302
Just describe it for you.

01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:17.728
No, that's the wedding of Columbus.
