00:01.735 --> 00:07.142
I didn't read her.

00:07.162 --> 00:09.204
There were books.

00:09.304 --> 00:21.039
In fact, she is only going to start another one book, and that isn't due out for a few months yet.

00:21.099 --> 00:28.148
If I had met her through books, I probably would have had a very long way to the public library.

00:30.035 --> 00:48.180
I didn't know that she was born in Texas and moved away when she was eight, thus giving us something to share and experience.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.886
My fellow Texans don't like that.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.809
They don't like for us to move away.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.713
They particularly like us to be successful.

01:00.410 --> 01:22.781
However, I think they're more inclined probably to forgive her than they are me, but by departing the local precincts, she found the theater and has given us all hours of sheer escapist delight and also some very powerful traumatic performances.

01:22.801 --> 01:27.868
I have the great honor of the impossible task of introducing

01:28.557 --> 01:52.241
The lady who truly needs no introduction, Karen.

01:52.261 --> 01:53.923
When Walter was talking about people asking progress, I had written something down.

01:54.140 --> 01:58.086
And it was the exact same thing.

01:58.106 --> 02:04.236
I think I got that same person's way out of being French.

02:05.798 --> 02:10.466
People are just wonderful to know, to get to know.

02:10.646 --> 02:15.393
And I feel that I do know so many of us who are involved in so nice coming up.

02:15.454 --> 02:21.463
And I was reminded as Walter was talking about getting out.

02:21.713 --> 02:29.302
meeting people, the very first time I was ever recognized on the street in the New Orleans.

02:30.203 --> 02:31.264
That's from number two.

02:31.584 --> 02:39.032
The first one was kind of a big guy who said, hey, aren't you that girl on the Gary Miller show?

02:39.153 --> 02:40.454
This is about 25 years ago.

02:41.015 --> 02:42.657
And I said, yes, I know.

02:42.717 --> 02:44.939
He said, I'll be darned.

02:44.959 --> 02:46.120
You're not such a dog.

02:46.140 --> 02:46.641
I'll be sorry about that.

02:54.130 --> 03:02.558
And another one, kind of along with St.

03:02.578 --> 03:07.382
Vane, the lady stopped me watching Bloomingdale, and she said, here's your honor, aren't you?

03:07.402 --> 03:08.123
And I said, yes.

03:08.143 --> 03:10.044
She said, would you sign this for my 15-year-old daughter?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.346
And she wants to be on television, just like you are.

03:12.467 --> 03:20.574
And I said, she reminds everybody of you, or don't even mind everybody of her.

03:20.594 --> 03:23.256
And I told her that if you could make it, anybody could.

03:23.276 --> 03:24.137
Which is kind of along that way of,

03:24.117 --> 03:28.562
Getting to what I have done the past two years.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.126
I wrote a book.

03:33.146 --> 03:37.731
I'm always thrilled to be able to read one.

03:37.751 --> 03:43.797
To get through writing one has been a love-hate relationship.

03:43.837 --> 03:45.139
I've never done this before.

03:45.299 --> 03:50.044
I don't know if I would ever do it again.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.247
I started it as an open letter to my three daughters.

03:53.851 --> 03:56.758
We're now at 22, 19, and 17.

03:57.339 --> 04:05.518
And I used to tell them, I wanted to tell them about growing up, how I felt growing up.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.984
And I wanted them to get to know my grandmother, my mother, and my dad.

04:08.004 --> 04:09.267
We're all dead now.

04:09.287 --> 04:11.893
And that was a way to introduce them to them.

04:12.059 --> 04:18.147
I used to tell these stories, various stories about my kooky grandmother who raised me.

04:18.167 --> 04:22.673
And the girls, when they were little, their eyes would just roll up in the back of their heads.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.996
They'd go, you're just in the end talking about the olden days.

04:25.877 --> 04:34.428
And I figured that the best way to do it was to write a letter to them so that they could read it whenever they wanted to.

04:34.568 --> 04:41.577
And about a year into this letter, a friend of mine showed me, or at the top of myself, to re-type again.

04:41.928 --> 04:46.817
I started getting serious about it, and they showed it to one of the statements that I had now.

04:47.257 --> 04:53.689
And she said, I think maybe I ought to get serious about this and keep on trucking with it.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.031
And so I did.

04:55.051 --> 05:05.269
And I even, the last December, bought a word processor because I figured out to be the only way I had to really meet the deadline because I wasn't smart like Walter.

05:06.532 --> 05:29.339
And so I took instructions from a person that bought the word process from.

05:29.359 --> 05:31.021
She's 12 years old.

05:31.041 --> 05:31.462
And I got through it.

05:31.482 --> 05:32.183
And I'm really happy that I did it.

05:32.203 --> 05:32.723
I told you why I wrote it.

05:32.744 --> 05:33.384
It was for my daughter.

05:33.404 --> 05:34.466
I told you how I wrote it.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.488
I spent many nights alone.

05:37.210 --> 05:44.641
But that gave me the reason.

05:44.661 --> 05:47.646
But then it's really about the first half of my life.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.769
It's very good to do with show business.

05:49.789 --> 05:52.554
It's about being raised in Hollywood.

05:52.574 --> 05:53.635
So my grandmother and I live in Texas.

05:54.557 --> 06:00.606
And living in, I guess, the neighborhood of Hollywood, not Hollywood.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.350
We live in the Black Forest, Hollywood Boulevard.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.652
My grandmother and I, we said,

06:04.750 --> 06:12.620
I grew up wanting to be an actress, or secretly wanting to be an actress.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.562
My mother wanted to write.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.687
She used to say to me, why don't you be a writer?

06:18.848 --> 06:22.672
And no matter what you look like, you can always write.

06:23.413 --> 06:32.665
I heard from doing this book that actually I wound up writing it for myself.

06:33.117 --> 06:36.322
more than I did my kids as a result of it.

06:36.342 --> 06:39.887
I went through a lot of things and resistance.

06:40.488 --> 06:50.061
I went through moments of disliking, even hating my parents as one does when you're growing up.

06:50.081 --> 06:59.475
And I came through it loving them again and realized that they did the best they could with what they were and the way they threw them out.

06:59.915 --> 07:01.858
And I would hope that from this,

07:02.125 --> 07:17.408
Actually, I'd like people to buy it and read it, and those who do, I would hope that they might sit down and write for their children or for their loved ones and leave something of themselves for them.

07:17.528 --> 07:22.676
That's really the main reason I wrote it, and I hope you all enjoyed it.

07:23.397 --> 07:29.787
And it's been a thrill to be here today and to be part of this wonderful group, and I thank you very much.

07:34.171 --> 07:35.558
Put your hands down, Kevin.

07:50.692 --> 07:58.749
This has been a very special breakfast, and we want to thank you all for coming.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.375
I want you to know I was born Irish, and I can't ride like that.

08:01.395 --> 08:08.430
And remember, as you go back, we are an important business.
