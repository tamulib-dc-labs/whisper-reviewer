WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:04.818
Well, we're talking to John Maggs.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.440
Yes.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.983
And what title do you retain here, sir?

00:09.443 --> 00:12.346
I retain title now as chairman of a company.

00:13.527 --> 00:13.667
Uh-huh.

00:14.008 --> 00:23.418
And our son Edward is now managing director, thank goodness, because it's hard, and you have to be young.

00:23.438 --> 00:26.541
Now I've turned 70.

00:26.561 --> 00:28.122
I can't rush as fast as I do.

00:28.423 --> 00:30.645
That's the trouble.

00:35.401 --> 00:46.591
how the book trade, this extraordinary explosion that started with Bernard Quaridge when he came from Germany in the middle of our century.

00:46.891 --> 00:55.960
We put great-grandfather Maggs down as 1853, but Bernard Quaridge was already in business before that.

00:57.021 --> 00:59.163
But they were much bigger, much sooner than we were.

00:59.583 --> 01:05.188
And of course that has hurt me because there's no mention of Maggs in there at all that Clements

01:06.468 --> 01:08.070
I don't think Clements was buying.

01:09.091 --> 01:13.716
That's kind of unusual because he really didn't like exploration and Americana.

01:13.776 --> 01:14.878
No, but he was Henry Stevens.

01:15.378 --> 01:15.959
That was the point.

01:15.999 --> 01:17.861
Henry Stevens would have been perfect for him.

01:17.881 --> 01:19.223
In the days when he was the greatest.

01:22.907 --> 01:30.435
But isn't it intriguing that book that was published in California about the immigrant booksellers in California.

01:30.475 --> 01:31.016
That is amazing.

01:31.136 --> 01:33.058
It's just wonderful.

01:33.078 --> 01:34.280
Now which book are we talking about?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.361
Not the...

01:36.033 --> 01:37.154
Is this a recent book?

01:37.174 --> 01:37.435
Yes.

01:38.336 --> 01:39.297
Rosenthal, isn't it?

01:41.719 --> 01:42.780
The Rosenthal Family.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.842
Okay, I'll check it out.

01:43.862 --> 01:44.682
I'm not so sure I know.

01:44.803 --> 01:45.924
Oh, oh.

01:46.444 --> 01:50.729
You're talking, of course, about the Barney Rosenthal.

01:50.789 --> 01:51.070
Exactly.

01:51.090 --> 01:51.450
That's right.

01:51.470 --> 01:51.630
Exactly.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.873
I'm hoping you have a chapter on that in this new book.

01:53.893 --> 01:57.216
I've already interviewed Barney.

01:57.477 --> 02:02.462
Outside that door, up on the top, there's a switch which turns off that noise.

02:02.813 --> 02:09.139
You'll see, jump just out of the door, and immediately left and up above, you'll see there's a little switch.

02:09.159 --> 02:09.500
You see that?

02:11.041 --> 02:14.104
Switch that up, and then that stops that sound.

02:14.124 --> 02:18.689
Yes, that was called The Gentle Invaders, I think you're talking about.

02:18.709 --> 02:21.091
Isn't that the lecture that Barney gave?

02:21.552 --> 02:23.594
Exactly, and the immigrants.

02:23.634 --> 02:24.195
The immigrants.

02:24.215 --> 02:27.238
He gave this lecture at Columbia University, I believe.

02:28.319 --> 02:28.419
Yeah.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.420
Oh, people like Krauss.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.622
People like Krauss and...

02:31.990 --> 02:35.835
Goldschmidt, not the one from here, but the one over there, Lucian, I guess.

02:35.895 --> 02:39.561
I'm interviewing his widow next week, as a matter of fact, in New York.

02:39.981 --> 02:46.590
You might have some suggestions of people I should talk to, because I said there were quite a few who came here, too, as well.

02:47.191 --> 02:47.892
But they're dying.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.796
They are dying, but they have survivors.

02:51.377 --> 02:51.597
Yes.

02:52.639 --> 02:53.019
I don't know.

02:53.300 --> 02:58.287
There's only one that's alive, so far as I can determine, which is Albert Febig in New York.

02:59.488 --> 03:01.491
Just a name to me.

03:01.606 --> 03:04.029
Yeah, that's it.

03:04.149 --> 03:07.072
But you know, we've lost Bill Fletcher in the last weeks.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.275
I didn't know that.

03:09.295 --> 03:11.297
He was one of the greatest of the British booksellers.

03:11.818 --> 03:14.441
Now, you brought this up as being very interesting.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.483
Why did you bring that up?

03:17.584 --> 03:28.677
As to how this book trade developed in London, middle of last century, it is intriguing.

03:29.146 --> 03:30.588
It intrigues you about it.

03:30.728 --> 03:33.431
As to how Mack's Anquiry got started.

03:36.995 --> 03:38.536
Don't you find that?

03:38.556 --> 03:39.157
Absolutely.

03:39.277 --> 03:42.541
It's a major concern, the consideration of this new book.

03:43.502 --> 03:47.026
How the book trade influences where the books go and who gets them.

03:47.746 --> 03:51.330
And then, Lathrop Harper is another part that no one remembers.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.273
This is my life, a lot of it.

03:54.974 --> 03:56.036
I was born in 26.

03:57.377 --> 03:59.119
I started here in 1947.

04:00.466 --> 04:01.628
when this was still going on.

04:03.671 --> 04:09.058
So, you weren't working here during the war years, of course, but you... No, my father was, though.

04:09.198 --> 04:11.301
What was it like during the war years?

04:11.322 --> 04:14.186
My father was busy doing business with G.I.'s.

04:16.008 --> 04:18.352
And, uh, every G.I.

04:20.455 --> 04:22.878
would come in here, and they wanted to buy a map.

04:23.098 --> 04:27.405
Of the groups in Britain.

04:27.425 --> 04:28.867
And so he would sell these G.I.'

04:28.847 --> 04:29.848
's like the speed maps.

04:30.993 --> 04:31.814
for next to nothing.

04:32.776 --> 04:34.218
And this is right here at Barclay Square?

04:34.238 --> 04:35.640
Yes.

04:35.660 --> 04:42.650
And then how... They were constantly having to save the place from being destroyed.

04:43.611 --> 04:46.936
You know, the firebombs, which were coming down thick and fast.

04:47.737 --> 04:48.939
And you've only got minutes.

04:49.440 --> 04:54.227
If you could get up to the roof and pick that... You've seen those in centuries, haven't you?

04:54.247 --> 04:59.194
There were little tubes of magnesium.

05:00.001 --> 05:06.891
And if you could pick that thing up, as it was just starting, and throw it into the street, you might save your building.

05:07.752 --> 05:07.973
Wow.

05:08.473 --> 05:17.947
And then, of course, the canny Germans then finally got onto that, and they started putting high explosives in them, as well as incendiary.

05:17.987 --> 05:19.129
You could be blown to bits.

05:20.110 --> 05:29.063
And so what they did was to divide the whole place up into areas with a team, and perhaps to be somebody

05:30.815 --> 05:40.769
all night on TV, awake, to see what they could do to save the place.

05:40.789 --> 05:45.576
And they had to know the insides of all the adjacent buildings so that they could run in.

05:46.838 --> 05:52.526
And it's nice to be able to see what's happening outside.

05:53.147 --> 05:54.188
Do you have a telly there?

05:54.288 --> 05:54.508
Yes.

05:54.529 --> 05:56.752
That's my post-circuit service.

05:56.792 --> 05:57.733
I don't feel lonely.

05:59.418 --> 06:06.124
And, you know, the intriguing story about that, which I've never forgotten, is that next door to us was Helena Rubenstein.

06:07.485 --> 06:07.585
Whoa!

06:09.187 --> 06:09.887
Yes, I saw.

06:10.488 --> 06:11.409
Thank you.

06:12.550 --> 06:14.431
There you go.

06:14.451 --> 06:14.651
Good.

06:15.312 --> 06:16.413
There's no lock, of course, ever.

06:16.653 --> 06:16.913
No.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.235
There's some ancient nautical instruments, I saw.

06:19.275 --> 06:20.997
Yes, that was a scientific sale.

06:21.818 --> 06:25.881
So I had a commission to go to buy a microscope for somebody in the States.

06:26.862 --> 06:27.923
And while I was there, I thought, well,

06:28.730 --> 06:29.771
Let's have a go at this.

06:29.831 --> 06:32.813
There's a lovely sextant there, which was going very cheaply.

06:33.394 --> 06:37.698
And I thought, well, it's a Scottish sextant.

06:37.718 --> 06:39.799
And, of course, this is 1880 or so.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.804
And the emigrantships going to Australia would have certainly used that.

06:45.824 --> 06:47.085
So I think I can bring that in.

06:47.105 --> 06:50.929
And, of course, that fits in with this, which is another.

06:50.989 --> 06:55.913
This is the pocket sextant, which was used by the overland explorers.

06:55.933 --> 06:56.813
Have you not seen this more?

06:57.854 --> 06:58.635
Have you not seen this?

06:58.936 --> 07:02.259
But they are, and there's a telescope there.

07:03.080 --> 07:03.481
May I ask?

07:03.721 --> 07:03.941
Yeah.

07:05.523 --> 07:06.183
And the vernia.

07:07.225 --> 07:08.386
Does it have a data there?

07:08.646 --> 07:10.728
Don't ask me how you use it, because I haven't learnt yet.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.771
Fascinating, isn't it?

07:13.791 --> 07:18.877
But you'll see, and here's the literature.

07:19.377 --> 07:22.841
Yes, here you are.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.623
That's it there.

07:24.643 --> 07:25.864
Which is Lord of Baines.

07:25.924 --> 07:26.985
Is that a Salkaby scale?

07:28.366 --> 07:29.347
This was Christie Southbury.

07:29.367 --> 07:29.908
Oh, Christie.

07:30.189 --> 07:31.911
Yes.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.296
That's not quite the same model, but very close.

07:36.277 --> 07:43.087
And Baines is that extraordinary man who was the artist on the Australian exploration.

07:44.209 --> 07:45.010
And Africa, too.

07:45.931 --> 07:50.358
And they've got many of the originals in the Logographical Society, which is time, where, and today, yes.

07:51.479 --> 07:52.321
Lovely.

07:52.341 --> 07:56.787
I'm very fond of the Logographical Society, which is a live, wild organisation.

07:57.323 --> 08:00.267
Your American geographical has gone downhill a bit.

08:01.569 --> 08:03.372
They've moved to the Middle West, haven't they, from New York?

08:03.792 --> 08:04.493
I'll check it out.

08:04.653 --> 08:06.496
That's an interesting question.

08:06.897 --> 08:10.782
Because the Royal geographical in London is on the up and up instead.

08:12.264 --> 08:16.110
And we pack our lecture theatre every Monday night.

08:18.333 --> 08:23.500
But there's just a fascination, a continuing fascination in Britain for

08:23.986 --> 08:24.787
exploration.

08:24.827 --> 08:27.589
This is an island nation.

08:27.770 --> 08:34.516
And we send, thank goodness, we send our youngsters off to the Orinoco or somewhere or other.

08:34.596 --> 08:35.537
You continue to do this?

08:35.557 --> 08:35.797
Yes.

08:36.818 --> 08:43.905
And the Rautographist Society interviews them to see what they're up to and gives them recommendations.

08:43.925 --> 08:52.373
And if they think they're really good, they give them a small grant and a bit of a cachet that they've gone up with the dressing of the Rautographist Society, which is a good thing.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.570
And our own daughter went on one such.

08:55.670 --> 08:55.970
Really?

08:56.591 --> 08:58.333
And it started her life.

08:59.574 --> 09:01.216
But she was learning diving.

09:01.677 --> 09:03.739
She's a botanist.

09:03.759 --> 09:05.862
And so she got an expedition up here.

09:05.882 --> 09:06.583
Here in the UK, basically?

09:06.603 --> 09:08.325
Yes, to go to Brazil.

09:09.506 --> 09:11.749
What a great place for a botanist to go.

09:11.769 --> 09:14.993
Well, no, there's a thing called the nudibrags she was studying.

09:15.473 --> 09:19.018
But she went to Karel Fulia here.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.423
And it meant getting the expedition together, raising the money,

09:24.533 --> 09:26.195
getting space on a ship for the stuff.

09:27.176 --> 09:30.841
And then the final crunch came at the end when they were leaving to come home.

09:31.842 --> 09:36.928
The Brazilian customs set on them for commissioning for that, this and that.

09:36.948 --> 09:39.891
And they learned that the hard way.

09:39.911 --> 09:42.915
Now she's become the world expert in her language, is seaweed.

09:43.996 --> 09:46.840
And this trip to Brazil helped to make the foundation of it.

09:48.362 --> 09:50.504
Well, has she done any monographs on this?

09:51.545 --> 09:52.887
All the time, yes.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.823
How do your children do?

09:56.124 --> 10:01.312
She's still young, but she's inclusive, and she sounds like a wonderful opportunity.

10:02.153 --> 10:03.275
I don't think there's something like this.

10:04.016 --> 10:04.236
Good.

10:05.398 --> 10:08.102
And there's a book on Brazil, I bet you have that for your daughter over there.

10:08.803 --> 10:10.786
This story had that typographia.

10:10.806 --> 10:11.848
Well, that's not her, you see.

10:12.489 --> 10:16.675
Typographia, it's not her.

10:17.135 --> 10:18.858
She's, as I say, she's seaweed.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.642
And she's very good stuff.

10:22.077 --> 10:24.259
That is fascinating, isn't it, seaweed?

10:24.279 --> 10:26.822
Are you discovering seaweed now as cool?

10:26.943 --> 10:43.882
Well, the point is this, that you see, in the early days, that's last century, all they could do was to send down a dredge and drag the seaweed up and then look at it or else be dependent on the seaweed that was thrown up on the shore after storms and study that.

10:44.623 --> 10:45.904
But she is a diver.

10:46.845 --> 10:50.329
And so she goes down and she gets her seaweed under the water

10:52.047 --> 10:53.869
which you can see it really in its habitat.

10:54.249 --> 10:55.831
How old is she?

10:55.851 --> 10:58.113
What is she now?

10:58.133 --> 10:59.954
Approaching 40 now.

10:59.975 --> 11:01.096
She has one lovely daughter.

11:02.056 --> 11:02.657
And what's her name?

11:02.677 --> 11:03.498
I should know her name.

11:03.838 --> 11:07.241
Her name is Campbell, her married name.

11:07.261 --> 11:09.103
But how would her first name?

11:09.924 --> 11:10.364
Chris.

11:10.384 --> 11:11.966
She's Dr. Christine Maggs.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.929
And she's the seaweed expert of the world.

11:15.169 --> 11:16.550
Christine with a C or a K?

11:16.710 --> 11:17.111
C-H.

11:18.372 --> 11:18.973
I'm sure I've seen her.

11:21.155 --> 11:21.615
I read the name of her.

11:21.950 --> 11:29.597
You might have seen the name, but if you want to know anything about seaweed, and the correct word, as you know, is phypology.

11:29.617 --> 11:33.001
From the Latin FCA, FUCA.

11:33.021 --> 11:33.741
That's her subject.

11:35.323 --> 11:39.487
And so she travels all over the world, giving conferences in Tokyo.

11:39.507 --> 11:40.988
You must be exceedingly proud.

11:41.208 --> 11:41.689
We are.

11:43.230 --> 11:50.337
And that little girl, when she could first start to crawl, her granny looked out of the window.

11:50.755 --> 11:59.587
And she saw this little tot crawling through the flower bed, doing this, throwing things out right, left and centre, and rushed out to find all the things she was... This is apocryphal.

11:59.687 --> 12:01.630
All the things she was pulling out were, in fact, weeds.

12:03.172 --> 12:06.596
Because, supposedly, she knew the difference from infancy.

12:06.716 --> 12:07.357
I believe that one.

12:07.377 --> 12:11.563
Then, of course, we took her to the beach, and she would crawl down into the sea.

12:12.164 --> 12:12.664
That's amazing.

12:13.185 --> 12:18.332
And she would start examining the shells and all the little things that lived in the rock pools and so on.

12:18.953 --> 12:23.577
So it came to her with infants, you know, her own little infant is following the same way.

12:27.081 --> 12:33.346
And so the granddaughters... So she was never tempted by the bookseller, by the book business.

12:33.366 --> 12:34.768
She writes the books instead now.

12:36.429 --> 12:38.211
And now there's another problem you have.

12:39.112 --> 12:46.058
I don't want to go into that or not, but it's extremely difficult when you have a family business

12:47.270 --> 13:16.602
who's going to come into the family business and you can ruin it if you get loads of children coming in all fighting as to who's going to be illegal and so on and this was the problem that my father had one son sorry two sons and his brother had one son that's cousin Brian and so

13:17.442 --> 13:26.715
It was made very clear that there would be one son from each side would come into the family business, and not two from one, and one from the other.

13:28.538 --> 13:29.579
And that makes for problems.

13:30.521 --> 13:33.164
But in your study... Oh, absolutely.

13:33.224 --> 13:38.632
Catherine Graham at the Washington Post has four children, and she made clear that only one runs the business.

13:38.873 --> 13:40.615
And others do different things.

13:41.118 --> 13:50.366
And she points out, look at the Washington Star, which was ruined because they had 22 family members running the business, and the business fell apart.

13:50.386 --> 13:59.174
So that absolutely makes, I mean, we've seen it, and it seems to make perfect sense the way the Maggs brothers have done it.

13:59.194 --> 14:03.778
And so, of course, the Maggs brothers were, in fact, grandfather and his brother.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.581
That was Ben and Ernest.

14:09.023 --> 14:10.424
You've read some of that, haven't you?

14:10.444 --> 14:11.125
Of course I have, yes.

14:13.400 --> 14:20.287
But the scene has changed totally.

14:20.307 --> 14:27.575
There's no more quick library building by, I think, in the days of film, Texas, for instance.

14:27.695 --> 14:31.599
And this is something that I'm interested in pursuing, so continue with that.

14:31.619 --> 14:32.660
This is in my time.

14:32.740 --> 14:32.981
Yeah.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.323
You've met Colin Franklin, have you?

14:35.343 --> 14:35.583
I have.

14:35.724 --> 14:37.706
I visited in the Knoxville class visit.

14:38.266 --> 14:38.847
Can I start?

14:38.887 --> 14:41.770
We gave talks together at the Brolier Club two years ago.

14:42.340 --> 14:47.366
And he's a great man lecturing and producing books.

14:48.407 --> 14:49.328
Masses of books.

14:50.149 --> 14:52.392
But you see, he's the son of the book business.

14:52.772 --> 14:53.693
As you know, Keegan-Paul.

14:54.074 --> 14:55.616
You say that as Keegan-Paul, right?

14:55.636 --> 14:56.056
Yes.

14:57.138 --> 14:58.579
And got out of that.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.664
And clouded his own thing.

15:02.684 --> 15:08.171
And I got a bit distressed at the time that he was becoming a bookseller.

15:09.552 --> 15:11.014
And he was going to specialise in

15:12.698 --> 15:14.922
fine printing, modern private presses.

15:16.564 --> 15:22.113
And mags have just bought a fabulous collection of things like passion beans and golden cockles and so on.

15:23.896 --> 15:26.440
And realising they've got to turn it over.

15:26.460 --> 15:31.067
It was all very expensive and so I'm going to print it on there, I think.

15:31.087 --> 15:32.189
And we made a deal.

15:32.209 --> 15:33.771
We sold the whole lot to Colin Franklin.

15:33.972 --> 15:35.574
Oh, really?

15:35.594 --> 15:38.799
Very quickly, at a small margin.

15:38.819 --> 15:40.562
And I think that probably made the foundation

15:40.897 --> 15:43.240
He had to start there, didn't he?

15:43.260 --> 15:44.862
I think so, to make a start.

15:45.022 --> 15:46.704
And he didn't sell it all at once.

15:46.724 --> 15:50.067
He worked it thoroughly.

15:50.088 --> 15:55.113
And because he's, of course, a fairly well-to-do, a fairly rich family, I think.

15:55.133 --> 15:59.398
Yeah, we visited his book barn up there in Cologne, which was quite great.

15:59.418 --> 16:08.208
But you see, that's another thing, is that if you've gone into that one, it's extraordinary, this business of, did you know about Harry Prankley, for instance, the books out of Tumblr's Wells?

16:08.228 --> 16:08.368
No.

16:08.849 --> 16:09.790
He would put all his

16:09.972 --> 16:11.154
one of the best books under the bed.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.720
And when he died, there was a cache of the most wonderful stuff.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.803
Harry, how do we pronounce it?

16:17.883 --> 16:19.205
Harry Pratley.

16:19.305 --> 16:19.645
P-R-A-T-L-E-Y.

16:19.665 --> 16:20.166
P-R-A-T-L-E-Y.

16:20.487 --> 16:22.569
Called Hall's Bookshop in town with Wells.

16:24.833 --> 16:29.139
But no children to follow on, so there was an auction sale.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.662
So why did he put the stuff down?

16:31.682 --> 16:33.384
Did he just like it, or did he save it?

16:33.404 --> 16:35.628
Because my father would do the same.

16:35.648 --> 16:38.832
He said, this is far too nice, I can't sell this.

16:39.622 --> 16:42.045
And he would take it home to some extent.

16:42.065 --> 16:45.148
So that's how I've inherited some quite lovely books.

16:46.830 --> 16:49.613
Not a lot, but some, but I don't do it now.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.396
And then you get an awful clash too.

16:52.416 --> 16:55.399
What are you to do if you're involved in a company?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.522
Those books are the property of the company.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.084
They're not your own.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.065
So you haven't getting that.

17:01.225 --> 17:03.908
Of course, and there's a perception among the clientele that

17:04.242 --> 17:05.924
Well, he keeps the best stuff for himself.

17:06.164 --> 17:06.364
Yes.

17:06.424 --> 17:07.545
You don't want that to happen.

17:07.565 --> 17:08.646
You don't want people to think that.

17:08.887 --> 17:13.632
Well, now, Bill Fletcher, who's just died, he did take a lot of the best stuff home.

17:13.652 --> 17:14.172
I'm sure he did.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.376
And it's said that he's died now with a whole warehouse full of books.

17:19.437 --> 17:21.219
This is Fletcher here in London?

17:21.239 --> 17:22.701
Fletcher, yes.

17:22.721 --> 17:23.702
He was Settle Court.

17:24.983 --> 17:25.904
What was the name of the company?

17:25.924 --> 17:26.665
H.M.

17:26.685 --> 17:27.105
Fletcher.

17:27.125 --> 17:27.986
H.M.

17:28.066 --> 17:28.967
Fletcher, okay.

17:29.147 --> 17:32.350
And the son is Keith.

17:32.370 --> 17:33.912
And so Keith is continuing the business.

17:36.136 --> 17:38.238
So we're going to see how that develops.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.862
But those days have gone and changed.

17:45.827 --> 17:46.748
Why have they changed?

17:46.908 --> 17:48.850
Books have become more expensive?

17:48.890 --> 17:51.193
Vastly more expensive.

17:51.213 --> 17:54.296
And my yardstick is Captain Cook.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.778
He's my hero.

17:55.878 --> 17:58.241
And my father's two.

17:59.402 --> 18:02.285
And my father used to sit at auction sales, and he'd sit.

18:02.365 --> 18:04.067
Well, you know the story of Captain Cook.

18:05.026 --> 18:06.808
eight volumes plus the big photo atlas.

18:07.509 --> 18:10.373
And he would see these, the whole lot being sold in good order.

18:11.494 --> 18:13.316
For perhaps 20, 30 pounds.

18:14.137 --> 18:14.698
Wow.

18:15.278 --> 18:17.621
He would buy every one he could get hold on.

18:17.641 --> 18:19.804
But the trouble is it's heavy.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.808
It's a big stack.

18:22.828 --> 18:25.551
And he filled the storeroom with these.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.695
Bought them far faster than he was selling them.

18:29.496 --> 18:30.938
But he said, one day you wait.

18:31.598 --> 18:32.439
So what's that now?

18:32.860 --> 18:33.801
That investment of

18:34.895 --> 18:35.876
20, 40 pounds.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.401
He's now worth 20,000 pounds or so.

18:41.964 --> 18:43.286
But he must make it a good investment.

18:44.528 --> 18:47.932
He bought them because he liked them, and he knew that that was going to be good.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.334
But he was also a businessman, though.

18:49.675 --> 18:56.023
He was, but I think he was a bookman more than a businessman.

18:56.964 --> 19:01.210
And the fact that he didn't sell them, I suppose, indicates that it was not an investment.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.653
I think it bears out your point.

19:04.190 --> 19:04.911
Do you ever do that?

19:04.931 --> 19:10.399
Do you ever buy books that you say, I'm taking these off?

19:10.419 --> 19:11.441
It's difficult.

19:11.621 --> 19:18.731
I broke my rule the other day for this man, Walter Hayes.

19:18.751 --> 19:20.614
He needed it more than I did.

19:20.634 --> 19:21.355
He had to have it.

19:23.358 --> 19:24.500
Of course, I was sad to say.

19:26.262 --> 19:28.586
Now, which item were we talking about?

19:28.606 --> 19:29.607
That was...

19:30.329 --> 19:32.351
The wonderful story, again, the bounty.

19:32.872 --> 19:33.853
The bounty line, okay.

19:33.913 --> 19:39.078
But this was the little notebook which Blyard kept in the open boat voyage across the Pacific.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.720
You had your hands on that?

19:40.740 --> 19:42.141
Yeah.

19:42.162 --> 19:43.243
That passed through your hand?

19:43.303 --> 19:44.164
Didn't I tell you that story?

19:44.324 --> 19:44.944
No, no.

19:45.305 --> 19:49.029
But you know, when Blyard... That should be in a museum.

19:49.129 --> 19:50.590
That should be in the... It is.

19:50.610 --> 19:50.791
It is.

19:50.811 --> 19:50.991
Okay.

19:51.251 --> 19:55.355
But when Blyard was kicked out of the Bounty... I know the story.

19:55.376 --> 19:58.178
He navigated his way home perfectly in an open boat.

19:58.279 --> 19:58.699
That's right.

19:59.287 --> 20:05.556
And so the first thing he did was to ask the chaps in the boat, had somebody got a notebook?

20:05.576 --> 20:07.899
And there was a man who'd been out surveying that morning.

20:07.919 --> 20:11.324
So he had a partly used little pocket notebook.

20:11.384 --> 20:22.340
So Briar took that over and proceeded to make his daily notes in that, including the notes about the scoundrels who had locked him up and put him under a wooden boat and so on.

20:23.542 --> 20:28.669
And anyway, so this little notebook

20:29.527 --> 20:30.809
came up for auction at Christie's.

20:31.350 --> 20:37.178
How recent is this, sir?

20:37.198 --> 20:37.599
Was it 20 years ago?

20:37.619 --> 20:38.019
Something like that.

20:38.039 --> 20:39.882
So did it come down through the Bly family?

20:40.723 --> 20:41.725
It must have done.

20:41.785 --> 20:44.489
It's slightly obscure how it did come through.

20:45.570 --> 20:49.897
And so Christie's made a great job of puffing this up.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.058
As well they should.

20:51.098 --> 20:53.482
This is one of the greatest feats of navigation ever.

20:54.203 --> 20:58.369
And so when this sale came up, there were at least half a dozen television cameras.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.619
This was big hot news.

21:01.639 --> 21:05.003
And Christie's had told that he was going to buy it.

21:05.023 --> 21:09.168
It certainly was going to be Mr. Traylon, the great bookseller at Guildford.

21:09.188 --> 21:12.152
He was buying it extensively for Paul Mellon.

21:12.172 --> 21:14.475
Mr. Who again, sir?

21:14.875 --> 21:15.035
Traylon.

21:15.055 --> 21:15.636
C-R-A-Y-N-E.

21:15.656 --> 21:23.866
And I suppose he's now perhaps the biggest living bookseller of that era.

21:23.946 --> 21:24.647
Is he here?

21:24.787 --> 21:26.449
He's in Guildford.

21:27.425 --> 21:31.771
Charles Traylon, a very, very remarkable man, too.

21:32.632 --> 21:34.495
Is he somebody I should talk to at some point?

21:34.515 --> 21:35.096
You should do.

21:35.316 --> 21:38.440
If he would see you, but don't for goodness I quote me or drop me in.

21:38.500 --> 21:46.391
No, no, no, no, I'm just... Charles Traylon, you should certainly go to see him, because it doesn't have to be this trick either.

21:46.431 --> 21:52.740
He won't last indefinitely, but he is the greatest in many ways.

21:57.243 --> 22:01.750
Well, how far is Guilford from here?

22:02.110 --> 22:03.572
No, I'm sorry.

22:03.592 --> 22:04.694
It's 30 miles.

22:04.714 --> 22:05.375
Well, that's easy.

22:05.575 --> 22:05.755
Hour?

22:05.815 --> 22:06.276
No.

22:06.296 --> 22:08.319
Half an hour, I think it was on the really fast track.

22:08.339 --> 22:09.841
It's Charles W. Traylon.

22:09.861 --> 22:10.923
Charles Traylon, yes.

22:10.943 --> 22:12.665
Okay, so why don't you go ahead and I'll write this down.

22:12.685 --> 22:17.472
You're telling us Traylon was presumed to be the... To be the buyer.

22:18.313 --> 22:21.478
And so all the television cameras were trained on him.

22:22.977 --> 22:26.000
And, of course, when the hammer fell, it was for me instead.

22:26.581 --> 22:28.984
And they all had to shift themselves.

22:30.365 --> 22:31.146
Oh, that's funny.

22:31.287 --> 22:32.488
Did you have a commission for that?

22:32.768 --> 22:33.169
Of course.

22:34.230 --> 22:36.112
From the Australian Prime Minister.

22:37.293 --> 22:37.634
Wow.

22:37.654 --> 22:40.077
Where it belonged, of course, for the National Library of Australia.

22:41.638 --> 22:49.247
So then, of course, all these people stuffing microphones at me to tell them the story.

22:49.267 --> 22:50.048
And I said, well, I can't.

22:51.309 --> 22:52.731
No comment and all that sort of thing.

22:54.162 --> 23:04.197
And then came the nightmare that the bid I had was in Australian dollars, and that the Australian dollar was just about to be devalued any moment.

23:04.418 --> 23:04.838
It was tipped.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.646
So I didn't really know how much money I got to spend.

23:09.666 --> 23:15.314
So I just kept my fingers crossed and I bought it, and it worked right.

23:16.236 --> 23:18.219
But anyway... What was the hammer, do you remember?

23:19.521 --> 23:22.465
Um... Approximately.

23:22.647 --> 23:25.812
I've got it all written down, but I haven't expected to go into this.

23:26.012 --> 23:32.481
But it was... And then came the nightmare.

23:33.162 --> 23:36.167
There had to be an export license, of course, for this city of Australia.

23:36.187 --> 23:38.310
It was generally terribly important.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.293
And they could actually cancel that very easily.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.017
It can be refused.

23:43.057 --> 23:45.680
The government could... But then they also have to match the price.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.002
Exactly, that's the point.

23:47.022 --> 23:49.566
But so the license was...

23:52.178 --> 23:55.903
The reason was that the microfilm I had submitted was not good enough.

23:57.485 --> 23:58.287
It had to be redone.

24:00.169 --> 24:05.657
Because there had to be a perfect microfilm, obviously before leaving, in case it might get lost in transit.

24:06.839 --> 24:11.365
So, I jumped onto a bicycle.

24:11.525 --> 24:19.857
And I went as fast as I could to the greatest book buyer in the world, who's out here at Clapham, Bernard Middleton, whose book is just out.

24:20.225 --> 24:24.832
There's a super book too, The Life of Fern Milton.

24:25.934 --> 24:28.719
And the problem was the gutter.

24:31.303 --> 24:35.389
Christie's had rebound the book, and it was like that.

24:36.190 --> 24:40.137
And you couldn't open it to get the microfilm down into the gutter.

24:40.918 --> 24:46.587
And the point was that it was important, because in there would lie writings.

24:47.039 --> 24:50.382
right into the gutter, because when he had it, it was quite loose.

24:51.043 --> 24:53.346
It's a terrible job of binding, isn't it?

24:53.366 --> 24:58.571
And so Bernard cut it open, and we got the microfilm done perfectly.

24:59.953 --> 25:06.579
And then he re-stitched it, and nobody would know that anything had happened.

25:06.599 --> 25:12.125
So it went to Australia, and then years later they published a facsimile of it.

25:13.607 --> 25:14.768
Beautiful facsimile.

25:15.794 --> 25:23.341
And to my amazement, I read this facsimile, and there was a blank on the facsimile pages down in the middle, in the gutter.

25:25.082 --> 25:38.694
And they said, well, sorry about this, but in the opinion of the chief conservator of the National Council of Australia, he would be inadvisable to force it open to microfilm the text in the centre.

25:38.714 --> 25:39.915
Which you had already done.

25:39.935 --> 25:41.616
Which I'd done.

25:41.636 --> 25:42.457
They never asked me.

25:44.239 --> 25:45.700
So I did scolding without that.

25:47.148 --> 25:57.022
And then, before it left the country, I got an invitation to the television programme on it.

25:57.042 --> 26:01.428
There's a wonderful series runs here called New Peter, which you've never heard of, for children.

26:02.950 --> 26:07.016
And the BBC producer thought this bounty story would be fun for the children.

26:08.758 --> 26:15.788
And so he sent to me, and I got the permission from the Australian Prime Minister to take a little manuscript to the studio,

26:17.050 --> 26:27.201
and also the Afro-Maritime Museum were allowed to go with the bounty chronometer.

26:28.042 --> 26:35.309
And that was the first time those pieces had been together in one place since the beginning.

26:35.329 --> 26:38.512
You must feel a great, you're reuniting things that belong together.

26:38.833 --> 26:39.393
Exactly.

26:39.413 --> 26:44.158
You know, it's like rewriting the Caxton manuscript of the Peeps Library.

26:44.198 --> 26:44.779
Yes.

26:44.995 --> 27:08.465
And so I had the enormous thrill the other day was to put on a, what I might call a man's lunch, for Walter Hayes, let's say, is the big chap, the Ford Motor Company, retired, and the new curator of horology in the International Maritime Museum, who's a younger man.

27:09.886 --> 27:13.551
And we had a wonderful lunch talking about the bounty and the chronometer.

27:16.045 --> 27:20.492
It's a thing, if you haven't got time on this trip, you have to go down to Greenwich and see that.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.116
We should lay that on a future trip.

27:23.377 --> 27:26.682
Oh, I'm a former naval officer myself, so I have a great... Of what sort?

27:27.223 --> 27:27.503
U.S.

27:27.944 --> 27:28.244
Navy.

27:28.445 --> 27:28.725
What?

27:29.306 --> 27:32.170
I was just a lieutenant, that's all.

27:32.471 --> 27:33.412
On an aircraft carrier.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.396
I was a seaman on an aircraft carrier.

27:35.416 --> 27:36.638
Oh, you were?

27:36.678 --> 27:37.379
USS Pibus.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.541
USS?

27:38.781 --> 27:41.345
Yes, because she was one of those lease-lengths.

27:41.365 --> 27:41.746
Uh-huh, okay.

27:42.266 --> 27:43.909
And she was baby flat-top.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.583
if you know what they were.

27:46.603 --> 27:48.525
I'm quite a historian of aircraft carriers.

27:48.545 --> 27:49.205
Built in Tacoma.

27:51.208 --> 27:55.332
One of those ones that was a converted, well originally going to be a merchant ship.

27:55.352 --> 27:58.255
A terrible thing with one propeller.

28:00.157 --> 28:03.441
How could a large aircraft, how could you get... Well she was a tiny thing.

28:04.442 --> 28:05.523
And she had a wooden flat deck.

28:06.904 --> 28:10.388
And she was just a floating petrol tank, really.

28:10.869 --> 28:11.309
I'm laughing.

28:11.349 --> 28:12.951
I was on the Ariskany, which was...

28:13.353 --> 28:17.560
an Essex-class carrier, which has now been in Mothball.

28:17.581 --> 28:18.783
I'm not even in Mothballs.

28:19.023 --> 28:20.786
I'm scrapped, long seats.

28:24.232 --> 28:25.675
We were talking about the changes.

28:25.695 --> 28:31.545
I had started, we were talking about World War II, when you were talking about the incendiary bombs.

28:31.565 --> 28:32.167
Yes.

28:32.187 --> 28:35.833
And I wonder if you could comment briefly on

28:36.910 --> 28:45.559
You know, bookselling in the immediate aftermath of World War II, and so many books really did make their way to North America, where people came over here.

28:45.579 --> 28:50.083
And you mentioned also the emigre booksellers that Barney Rosenthal was written about.

28:50.644 --> 28:53.486
They were very instrumental in this, too, weren't they?

28:53.907 --> 29:01.895
Could you just comment on that at all, about the emigre, the migration of books, you know, to North America, and then perhaps, you know?

29:01.915 --> 29:06.259
But the books were about imperfusion, then, because all those country house libraries

29:07.420 --> 29:37.005
had got magnificent collections of books and some of them had been badly war damaged and the particular one one thinks of of course is right here in London Holland House Holland House which was hit by bombs and badly damaged and they worked away as fast as they could and they got the books out

29:37.762 --> 29:41.206
Eventually those books were sold at auction in London.

29:41.226 --> 29:45.592
Mountains of books, and the most wonderful books you could ever imagine.

29:46.233 --> 29:50.558
And my father would fill his car for these auction sales.

29:51.760 --> 29:57.207
And he said, I know I don't read it at the moment, but books are going to be scarce one day.

29:57.227 --> 30:00.691
And I was forever building new bookshelves here in the basement, you've seen them.

30:01.973 --> 30:02.634
You built that?

30:02.874 --> 30:06.098
Yeah, and I was stacking the books in double rows.

30:07.327 --> 30:08.068
books everywhere.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.133
And they were good books.

30:11.153 --> 30:12.875
I mean, books like Piranesi, for instance.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.098
They were quite big things.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.702
Things you don't see at all now.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.850
And I'd say to my father, for goodness sakes, stop buying any more books.

30:22.870 --> 30:28.178
And it was the famous saw when he went to, this was Hodgson's.

30:28.418 --> 30:28.839
Hodgson?

30:28.879 --> 30:29.820
Hodgson, H-O-D-G-S-O-N.

30:31.523 --> 30:37.131
The same one then in the city of London, which is now absorbed by salaries and lost

30:38.107 --> 30:42.892
But they were the premier... But they were the only book selling in London.

30:42.912 --> 30:44.294
There was exclusively books.

30:45.736 --> 30:48.659
Sotheby's then were not important in books at all.

30:48.679 --> 30:53.985
They were selling paintings, furniture and so on.

30:54.005 --> 30:56.628
And so my father went to one of these sales, a big sale at Hodgson's.

30:57.909 --> 31:05.117
The sale was always to start Thursdays and Fridays at one o'clock lunchtime.

31:05.137 --> 31:05.818
One o'clock came.

31:06.507 --> 31:08.209
and the area of silence had gone off.

31:08.490 --> 31:09.971
So this is during the war?

31:09.991 --> 31:10.652
During the war, yes.

31:11.754 --> 31:15.358
And there was nobody there.

31:15.478 --> 31:19.043
So the auctioneer, Mr. Hodgson, said, well, one o'clock, so we start as usual.

31:21.206 --> 31:24.810
And the only people there were my father and the auctioneer.

31:24.830 --> 31:26.232
Oh, come on.

31:26.252 --> 31:29.897
And so they bought all turnip blocks, I think.

31:29.917 --> 31:33.882
My father had had a lecture before he went on his seatbelt.

31:36.207 --> 31:41.273
to buy anything, where it's skinned.

31:41.293 --> 31:47.981
And here my father had bought literally half the sale, because he had to.

31:48.001 --> 31:48.962
So he got back here.

31:49.163 --> 31:50.484
This was Uncle Ernest's office.

31:51.706 --> 31:53.868
This was Ernest's office.

31:53.888 --> 31:55.190
There was a bit of a time.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.471
And your dad's name was?

31:56.752 --> 31:57.432
Frank.

31:58.033 --> 32:03.700
And so my father got back here with the auction tabloid.

32:04.675 --> 32:09.719
He opened the door here of Ernest's office, his uncle's office, and he threw the cataloguing and ran.

32:12.562 --> 32:20.228
But here he had done what he was not to do, and he bought half the auction sale.

32:20.248 --> 32:23.231
He couldn't be sacked, obviously, because he was... He was an egg.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.993
He was family.

32:25.013 --> 32:29.797
But... And of course, he was a book collector, which Ernest was not.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.720
And Frank could see the value of these things, and Ernest couldn't.

32:34.443 --> 32:38.268
Although Ernest could see, he portrayed as an accountant, I think.

32:38.288 --> 32:39.610
He could see the financial sector.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.374
The firm had no money at all.

32:44.057 --> 32:46.520
Nobody had any money.

32:46.540 --> 32:50.786
I think Frank had bought all these books that were just going to be stacked up in the basement.

32:51.948 --> 32:52.689
Thank goodness you do.

32:52.889 --> 32:54.351
You may still have some of these.

32:54.992 --> 32:57.475
We certainly have some of them, still, yes.

32:57.495 --> 33:00.480
We don't now, but we certainly have some.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.365
And these were consigned by various

33:04.548 --> 33:07.070
Well, in this particular case, it was the Bond Library, you see.

33:07.090 --> 33:08.552
So this was the Bond Library?

33:08.572 --> 33:11.414
This was Lord Holland, Holland House.

33:13.856 --> 33:16.939
I could show you some of them, I think, still.

33:16.959 --> 33:24.266
And they were wonderful books.

33:24.286 --> 33:25.327
Did he ever get recognition for doing the race game?

33:25.347 --> 33:25.747
Signed or something?

33:25.767 --> 33:28.470
Didn't from his uncle, anyway.

33:28.490 --> 33:28.750
Not at all.

33:28.770 --> 33:29.110
From me.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.271
Do you remember this well?

33:31.392 --> 33:34.335
Do you personally remember this well when this happened?

33:34.602 --> 33:36.685
Well, that was before my time, of course.

33:36.705 --> 33:39.168
But it was before you were in the company.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.450
I didn't start until 47.

33:40.490 --> 33:46.919
But, I mean, you must have remembered, there must have been talk at home about, oh, God, I can't believe what I just did today.

33:46.939 --> 33:48.361
He never talked a lot.

33:51.625 --> 34:01.459
My mother wasn't in on it, and then remember that it was very difficult then because they lived 15 miles out of London, and he was doing that journey to and fro on his bicycle every day.

34:01.479 --> 34:01.639
Wow.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.002
Public transport was very difficult.

34:04.842 --> 34:07.284
and irregular.

34:10.287 --> 34:13.110
So he never really talked about anything much at all.

34:14.631 --> 34:18.295
Do you recall generally what year this might have been during the war?

34:19.016 --> 34:21.398
I'll look it up.

34:21.718 --> 34:22.559
Because of the sale.

34:22.819 --> 34:32.689
And by the way, look how grateful one is to Henry Stevens and for auction records, where they list all those auction sales

34:33.783 --> 34:37.208
in the preamble of every volume.

34:37.328 --> 34:39.512
Do you remember what happened to the Hawks and Records?

34:39.532 --> 34:39.692
Correct.

34:40.633 --> 34:56.036
That there had been a long agreement that if ever the Hawks and Records had to be sold, our Antigrable Service Association would have the first chance to buy it because they said it was the Bible of the book trade and it's got to be retained in the trade.

34:57.378 --> 35:01.765
And they made a committee and they put onto the committee

35:02.875 --> 35:05.758
Do you remember the name of Dawson's?

35:05.778 --> 35:06.999
That's Dawson's of London.

35:07.019 --> 35:08.400
No, Dawson's of London.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.463
Yes, and a man called Bert Marley, long since then.

35:12.403 --> 35:19.850
And he was simultaneously on the committee for the association to buy book or books from the cause.

35:19.870 --> 35:27.016
And at the same time, he was representing his firm, Dawson's, to buy it for them.

35:27.036 --> 35:31.380
And so he was expelled from the association because it was bought by Dawson's.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.891
And it went down the drain almost at once.

35:35.452 --> 35:41.780
And thank goodness it's all now been saved at the American book crisis with Dan and Kathy Lieb.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.364
That is the most wonderful thing now.

35:44.404 --> 35:44.924
The CD1.

35:45.245 --> 35:47.408
I'm going to have to get that, by the way.

35:47.548 --> 35:48.489
Get the CD1.

35:49.931 --> 35:51.733
I hope to write a review of that, actually.

35:51.794 --> 35:55.078
And the extraordinary thing is that that is edited.

35:55.098 --> 35:56.279
We're convinced of it.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.843
They don't just rely on the auction catalogue.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.266
If there's something that looks a bit odd,

36:01.634 --> 36:04.979
when they're editing that, they'll check up.

36:04.999 --> 36:08.264
And there's additional information in there that isn't immediately obvious.

36:08.985 --> 36:10.708
It's a very remarkable publication.

36:10.848 --> 36:16.276
Well, that is really where the computer is superior to the printed book, don't you think?

36:16.296 --> 36:24.308
And another one, of course, is the Dictionary National Biography, which is vastly superior to the printed one.

36:24.328 --> 36:29.616
And to demonstrate that, Aiyong San Ednaz, who's the computer freak here,

36:31.351 --> 36:43.112
demonstrated to me the new CD-ROM of the Dictionary Natural Biography, and he turned up, keyed in there, John Maggs, and Ushkane instantly did the contribution that I made to that.

36:43.954 --> 36:46.939
It is amazing, isn't it, to see that happen?

36:46.959 --> 36:47.901
It's extraordinary.

36:47.921 --> 36:49.484
The OED is, of course.

36:49.504 --> 36:50.526
Exactly, that's another one.

36:50.546 --> 36:51.227
That's another one.

36:52.549 --> 36:54.152
We're all going to stop, I don't know, but...

36:55.212 --> 37:01.019
Well, you think with all this talk about computers replacing books, do you have any thoughts on that?

37:01.039 --> 37:02.080
Does this concern you?

37:02.160 --> 37:08.368
I get worried about it, because some of, and by the way, my definition of a youngster here is anybody younger than I am.

37:08.888 --> 37:10.350
That's my definition, too.

37:10.410 --> 37:22.705
But if I ask them about such and such a book, and some of them just reach over to the desk, and they do this, and they look wisely at the screen, and say, well, I can't see anything here.

37:24.338 --> 37:29.402
I say, no, get me the book, I know we've got one.

37:29.422 --> 37:32.565
You see, they're dependent on that screen.

37:32.585 --> 37:33.246
That's the trouble.

37:36.008 --> 37:41.212
We are computerising the stock here progressively, but we're only starting from now.

37:42.113 --> 37:45.576
And so the new stock coming in goes on that computer.

37:45.596 --> 37:50.840
But the stuff that I rely on, the old stuff, isn't on it, and probably never will be.

37:51.781 --> 37:53.923
It would take far too long to go backwards.

37:55.709 --> 37:57.091
I think they are.

37:57.131 --> 37:59.054
You may be able to scan it at some point.

37:59.254 --> 38:00.116
Oh, it could do.

38:00.136 --> 38:01.337
We have a scanner here.

38:02.379 --> 38:03.661
But is that bookseller?

38:05.684 --> 38:09.189
Do you see the emerging generations of booksellers?

38:09.269 --> 38:10.451
Are they the scholars?

38:12.594 --> 38:16.420
People who really understand books and can do detective work?

38:16.460 --> 38:18.863
I rather doubt it.

38:19.524 --> 38:20.606
But aren't we lucky here?

38:20.626 --> 38:23.029
We've got John Collins working here.

38:23.049 --> 38:24.872
If you know his book, The Two Forgers.

38:25.645 --> 38:26.566
Which is excellent.

38:29.009 --> 38:30.712
It's totally different.

38:32.534 --> 38:37.240
And you saw, didn't you, that the trade set up a degree course for booksellers.

38:38.041 --> 38:38.662
No, I didn't know.

38:38.682 --> 38:39.503
University of London.

38:39.523 --> 38:40.625
Oh, I didn't know that.

38:40.645 --> 38:42.848
Where you were going to get a degree in bookselling.

38:43.929 --> 38:45.111
That's very interesting.

38:45.231 --> 38:47.053
And this ran for the first year.

38:49.176 --> 38:50.458
And the first ones graduated.

38:51.279 --> 38:53.301
University of London.

38:53.321 --> 38:54.623
And now the money's run out.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.628
And that's come to the end of the month.

38:58.648 --> 38:59.349
It's an abeyance.

38:59.369 --> 39:01.352
Who was the director over there?

39:01.532 --> 39:03.736
Do you know who was headed up that department?

39:03.756 --> 39:06.800
Well, it was Antigran Bookshare Association who was running it.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.905
But at the University of London?

39:09.925 --> 39:10.947
I couldn't tell you.

39:10.967 --> 39:11.347
I didn't remember.

39:11.367 --> 39:12.569
Oh, it's at the University of London.

39:12.589 --> 39:13.210
I'm sorry.

39:13.230 --> 39:13.471
Yes.

39:14.712 --> 39:22.905
And so we had them in here as part of their degree course to see how Mags' bookshop worked.

39:25.096 --> 39:33.185
I did my best to try to do something with you, but I would say, you can't learn this as a university course.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.347
You've got to do it the hard way.

39:35.367 --> 39:39.471
And ideally, you should really start at the bottom.

39:39.491 --> 39:48.561
And the man we've just hired, and he's brilliant, had been working as a porter in one of the London auction rooms.

39:49.122 --> 39:51.424
And the porter is a very, very important person.

39:53.193 --> 39:57.178
If you know the story of Jock and Frank and Sotheby's, the two saline porters.

39:57.778 --> 39:58.820
Gerald, I don't know that.

39:59.721 --> 40:00.382
Jock and Frank.

40:00.522 --> 40:07.931
And you know, I would watch big men, like dental surgeons, rushing them there into that saline for their viewing in a hurry.

40:08.331 --> 40:13.257
And they'd say, I'm a collector, I want to see that look you've got on the care of the teeth.

40:13.277 --> 40:16.561
And Jock and Frank didn't say, what's the lot number?

40:16.581 --> 40:19.004
They said, just as half a second, and they reached it off the shelf.

40:19.024 --> 40:22.508
Because they'd, if you know the expression, they'd put up that saline.

40:23.534 --> 40:28.502
They got them out of the boxes, and they put them in order on the shelves, and they looked at them.

40:28.842 --> 40:30.184
And they knew the books as a result.

40:31.807 --> 40:32.628
That's a different tradition.

40:32.668 --> 40:34.611
You don't find people like that.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.195
And that was two people, Jacques and Frank?

40:37.595 --> 40:40.880
Jacques and Frank, yes, with two bookworm porters.

40:42.903 --> 40:46.108
I'm interested in the kind of collector you see today.

40:46.188 --> 40:50.014
Are there any collectors in the grand tradition?

40:51.378 --> 40:52.900
I guess there are.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.021
You still see this.

40:54.882 --> 40:58.887
They keep quiet.

41:05.334 --> 41:07.977
I'm seeing fewer and fewer of them myself now.

41:08.177 --> 41:10.600
I'm more in the back room now.

41:10.620 --> 41:14.244
I rely on my screen there to see them coming in.

41:14.404 --> 41:17.588
My job is to rush out there and shake them by the hand.

41:17.787 --> 41:23.875
The terrible thing is they will then say, you remember those days when we used to buy all this sort of stuff for nothing?

41:24.355 --> 41:26.819
But they're real good to you now.

41:26.919 --> 41:30.083
What you've got to have is the big spenders.

41:32.927 --> 41:36.171
Like the man out in Chile.

41:36.191 --> 41:37.893
He was a very good collector.

41:39.435 --> 41:40.256
Jack called Edwards.

41:42.339 --> 41:43.881
And what does he collect, basically?

41:43.901 --> 41:45.162
Just great books?

41:45.563 --> 41:47.305
Anything he likes.

41:48.517 --> 41:50.419
Edwards is his name?

41:50.939 --> 41:54.222
Edwards, yes, which could be Bird Books, for instance.

41:54.242 --> 41:56.384
He's very well known.

41:56.424 --> 41:58.025
Is Jerry Carla's first name?

41:58.045 --> 42:01.368
He's Augustine.

42:01.388 --> 42:05.672
And his father, or his grandfather, did a book about Chile.

42:07.814 --> 42:08.234
Edwards.

42:08.815 --> 42:10.556
Now, is that English?

42:10.576 --> 42:11.057
English, yes.

42:11.137 --> 42:11.517
In Chile?

42:11.577 --> 42:12.938
In Chile, yes.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.741
But as you know, Britain, England ran Chile.

42:17.302 --> 42:18.203
If you know the story of Higgy.

42:19.432 --> 42:20.773
Did you know that England ran Chile?

42:20.833 --> 42:21.574
I didn't know that.

42:21.894 --> 42:23.936
We ran all of South America.

42:23.956 --> 42:26.218
You ran all of the... Yes.

42:27.639 --> 42:35.226
Most of the... And the man who was behind it all was the man who used to live in this house, was Prime Minister Canning.

42:35.246 --> 42:35.766
Did you know that?

42:36.187 --> 42:36.647
Yes.

42:36.667 --> 42:39.049
Ed mentioned that Canning lived here.

42:39.329 --> 42:40.190
Yes.

42:40.270 --> 42:43.233
This building has a provenance to the 1740s, I think.

42:43.873 --> 42:45.054
Exactly.

42:45.094 --> 42:47.216
And he was Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.

42:48.097 --> 42:48.257
Oh.

42:48.710 --> 42:53.455
And they lived in this house for only a short time, like 18 months.

42:53.475 --> 43:00.262
And it was a pathetic story, which was supposed to be true, that that little boy got ill.

43:01.383 --> 43:06.348
And mother had no confidence in the doctor here on the block.

43:06.368 --> 43:13.135
And so she moved the family out somewhere else, and they sold this house.

43:13.155 --> 43:16.118
So once again, it went into that we'd claimed

43:17.735 --> 43:19.757
allegiance to George Canning.

43:19.777 --> 43:22.320
Well, when did the ghost purportedly move in?

43:22.520 --> 43:23.221
After Canning?

43:23.721 --> 43:27.084
Or before that, I think.

43:27.124 --> 43:30.748
The ghost story is so much of it is fiction.

43:30.768 --> 43:36.454
I've done so many television programs on that, I think they've all mixed up, but I invent them as I go along.

43:36.474 --> 43:42.580
I had to do a ghost program for British Airways, which was very funny.

43:43.381 --> 43:45.463
But they show a movie

43:47.283 --> 43:53.610
as they're about to be landing in London from a long-haul flight to get people adjusted to life in London.

43:54.611 --> 43:56.733
And they did one section on haunted London.

43:58.615 --> 44:01.278
And so they had a piece from me.

44:01.298 --> 44:05.422
And one of our customers was sitting dozing in his seat.

44:05.442 --> 44:08.005
He suddenly saw Mags' bookstore coming up on the screen.

44:09.166 --> 44:11.028
He realised he hadn't been in for quite some time.

44:11.048 --> 44:13.871
He came rushing straight in the sense that he landed.

44:13.891 --> 44:14.792
And he spent a lot of money.

44:14.812 --> 44:15.653
So that was worthwhile.

44:16.544 --> 44:18.827
a great story.

44:18.847 --> 44:23.774
Just, if you have a few minutes, tell us when you feel that you have to break this up.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.776
No, I'm alright, because I'm a pensioner now.

44:28.860 --> 44:31.524
And do you know how I came to be, to have a pension?

44:33.046 --> 44:34.408
Did they tell you that story?

44:34.428 --> 44:35.048
No, no.

44:35.509 --> 44:37.732
Because you know the name Malthus, on population.

44:37.972 --> 44:39.674
Of course, yeah.

44:39.694 --> 44:41.737
Malthusian name has been an adjective.

44:41.777 --> 44:44.661
Well, we had a scout who would

44:46.379 --> 44:48.642
give us news from what was happening in the country.

44:49.764 --> 45:05.588
And one day he rang up from a phone box in the Isle of Wight that he'd been to a country sale, a viewing, and there was a shoebox full of manuscripts, letters.

45:05.608 --> 45:08.653
And he started looking through this, and it was autograph letters of Malthus.

45:09.014 --> 45:09.795
Wow.

45:11.497 --> 45:14.462
And so he got on to Robert Harding here,

45:16.214 --> 45:43.268
goodness Robert Harding took the call, and Robert, thank goodness, just said to him, get it, hold it, buy it, regardless really, until he got it very, very reasonably, and got it home, sure enough, it was the last very clutch of Malthus, of rough letters, not in captivity.

45:45.762 --> 45:49.986
That made so much money that that funded my pension.

45:51.187 --> 45:52.448
I love that one.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.649
It was worthwhile.

45:53.949 --> 45:57.332
Do you still have scouts working the country?

45:57.352 --> 45:59.134
They are a dying commodity.

46:00.015 --> 46:02.817
Because that's a real specialized skill too, isn't it?

46:03.037 --> 46:05.860
And there were several sorts of them.

46:05.880 --> 46:08.943
But some of them would buy for their own stock.

46:10.664 --> 46:15.128
And some of them would run and take the thing.

46:15.901 --> 46:21.209
to somewhere else where they knew they could sell it.

46:21.549 --> 46:25.515
The best of them were men of complete trust.

46:25.535 --> 46:30.262
And you would let this chap have one of your lovely things, and he'd say, I think I can sell that for you.

46:30.282 --> 46:32.826
And a month later, he'd either bring it back or come back with a check.

46:34.368 --> 46:35.270
But they'd go on.

46:37.072 --> 46:42.280
This one man remains very actively a standard Paul Montagnon.

46:43.677 --> 46:44.318
He's a scout?

46:44.498 --> 46:45.138
He's a scout.

46:45.158 --> 46:46.399
Is he based here in London?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.201
He's just out of London.

46:48.241 --> 46:48.682
His name?

46:49.042 --> 46:50.283
Montagnana.

46:50.303 --> 46:50.763
M-O-N?

46:51.004 --> 46:52.805
M-O-N-T-A-N-A-N-A.

46:52.905 --> 46:54.707
T-A-N-A.

46:54.727 --> 46:55.568
Montagnana.

46:56.969 --> 46:57.650
Is he listed?

46:57.730 --> 46:58.731
Is he somebody?

46:58.811 --> 47:00.172
I'd love to talk to a book scout.

47:02.694 --> 47:05.177
There's a great tradition of book scouting.

47:05.197 --> 47:05.537
There is.

47:06.318 --> 47:07.819
And I say he's one of the vast.

47:08.019 --> 47:13.144
And this new book is going to discuss book culture and dying skills and emerging skills.

47:13.428 --> 47:15.150
I'd love to talk to him, folks, though.

47:15.430 --> 47:19.815
I think we could get you his address.

47:19.835 --> 47:20.476
And I'll write him.

47:20.496 --> 47:23.099
You know, I doubt if we can put it together this trip.

47:23.119 --> 47:24.100
This is a brief trip.

47:24.120 --> 47:24.881
We're coming back.

47:25.061 --> 47:27.524
I've got another portrait of him here on my desk somewhere.

47:28.165 --> 47:29.006
Of Mortignana?

47:29.186 --> 47:29.486
Yes.

47:29.566 --> 47:30.588
There's a portrait of him.

47:31.168 --> 47:32.770
Because I snapped him when he was here.

47:32.790 --> 47:33.251
Oh, I see.

47:33.691 --> 47:34.732
How old is he?

47:34.752 --> 47:35.774
About approximately.

47:38.617 --> 47:40.219
70-something, or if not, 80.

47:40.239 --> 47:41.460
Oh, doesn't he sound great?

47:41.947 --> 47:46.131
And he still travels with his box of books.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.873
Oh, I'd love to do an interview with him.

47:49.414 --> 47:50.274
But you're a bit late.

47:50.395 --> 47:51.135
He's all right.

47:51.456 --> 47:53.878
But the other man, of course, was Howlett.

47:55.339 --> 47:59.002
And he was utterly wonderful.

47:59.022 --> 48:01.424
H-O-W-L-E-T.

48:01.444 --> 48:02.666
Known him as Happy Howlett.

48:02.846 --> 48:04.167
Happy Howlett.

48:04.187 --> 48:09.331
And he would come in always with a cardboard box tied up with string.

48:09.352 --> 48:09.912
No packing.

48:11.883 --> 48:15.267
One day he came in, it was very wet.

48:15.287 --> 48:20.092
And I offered him a new cardboard box.

48:20.113 --> 48:21.734
He was mentally offended.

48:21.754 --> 48:23.697
This was, I was, the height of rudeness.

48:24.377 --> 48:27.962
It meant that I didn't think much of his cardboard box.

48:28.722 --> 48:30.124
And he wouldn't come in again for months.

48:32.006 --> 48:32.847
Oh, happy cowboy.

48:33.047 --> 48:36.752
But he came back eventually.

48:36.772 --> 48:39.595
And what kinds of things would he bring in?

48:41.532 --> 48:45.315
It was just what you said you wanted, really, what you said you were looking for.

48:45.395 --> 48:47.737
Oh, so you would give him your want list, so to speak.

48:47.757 --> 48:49.479
Well, an idea of the things you wanted.

48:49.919 --> 48:50.840
And he'd rather find them.

48:50.980 --> 48:51.421
Yes.

48:51.441 --> 48:52.762
And where do you suppose he found them?

48:53.242 --> 48:56.905
He would go all around Guilford, perhaps, around other shops around the country.

48:58.487 --> 48:59.388
We didn't travel enough.

49:03.391 --> 49:09.076
That was it, that they were getting things somewhere where they were not wanted, and moving them somewhere where they were wanted.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.438
And there was a markup in between.

49:11.873 --> 49:13.956
that they could live on.

49:13.976 --> 49:18.443
Were they largely buying from other booksellers, or did they get into private homes, do you think?

49:18.523 --> 49:19.004
Mostly not.

49:19.064 --> 49:21.467
No, it was other booksellers in the way.

49:21.488 --> 49:27.977
Because private homes can be difficult, because that's the problem of what you're going to pay.

49:27.997 --> 49:30.341
And that's another thing now is the idea.

49:30.361 --> 49:33.866
And this is absolutely out of control now.

49:33.926 --> 49:34.667
Lots of colleges.

49:36.410 --> 49:37.712
You did, haven't you?

49:38.317 --> 49:40.680
Our Library of Congress has gone through something.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.283
The Ptolemy's just gone missing.

49:42.303 --> 49:43.544
Oh, I didn't know that.

49:43.685 --> 49:44.926
Yes, the Bell and Jerry Ptolemy.

49:45.627 --> 49:46.088
Oh, my God.

49:46.228 --> 49:47.690
They talk of a value of 30,000 pounds.

49:48.592 --> 49:50.815
It was Christchurch, Oxford.

49:50.835 --> 49:52.377
The stock was being taken into Solvice.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.825
And they never thought to investigate.

49:58.425 --> 49:59.527
That's disturbing.

50:00.809 --> 50:02.391
It's very, very serious.

50:02.551 --> 50:07.378
The Solvice has had a few problems like that recently when they've been able to come in.

50:07.780 --> 50:12.946
Maybe they should have just looked at it a little more vigilantly.

50:13.687 --> 50:16.490
But that happens to all of us.

50:16.510 --> 50:17.290
It does.

50:17.311 --> 50:19.933
In fact, it's the bookseller's nightmare, isn't it?

50:20.294 --> 50:21.495
You get hit on both sides.

50:21.515 --> 50:26.721
You get hit for buying it, and then when you sell it, you lose both ways.

50:27.722 --> 50:35.230
And there was the worst in my time was the American intellectual, American Negro, probably Philadelphia.

50:36.672 --> 50:37.753
And he would come in.

50:38.830 --> 50:44.339
Very, very intelligent, well-dressed, refined person.

50:44.359 --> 50:53.514
And he'd come in with lovely books and he had the story that his father would be a great book collector.

50:53.534 --> 51:01.867
And if only we'd sat down and thought, well, no, this man's father would have been going into slavery.

51:01.888 --> 51:03.791
You'd think, how did he have an old family library?

51:03.811 --> 51:04.652
It just doesn't make sense at all.

51:06.623 --> 51:18.659
And anyway, it all finally came out, and he went to Ben Weinrib, who's still living, and he had the woodblock, the Buick woodblock, of the Chirin and Bull.

51:18.679 --> 51:26.649
And Weinrib said, yes, I'd love to buy that, but I must have it in for a few days to think about it.

51:26.669 --> 51:31.235
And instantly, of course, he ran a new parcel, who a Buick came from.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.678
And they went to look up their shelf, and they were missing.

51:33.698 --> 51:35.280
And that was it.

51:36.728 --> 51:37.769
So the man was arrested.

51:38.490 --> 51:39.250
When he came back?

51:39.831 --> 51:40.392
Yes.

51:40.412 --> 51:41.733
This is how they do it normally.

51:41.773 --> 51:43.234
They say, leave it for a couple of days.

51:43.254 --> 51:44.596
And then he started to sing.

51:45.817 --> 51:48.079
And he said, oh, I've been selling lots of stuff to Mads, too.

51:49.441 --> 51:56.628
And so the police came rushing around here, and they wanted all the receipts for everything we bought from the man.

51:56.648 --> 52:02.754
And one of them, I remember so well, was a set of good birds from Australia.

52:02.774 --> 52:05.196
And it had no covers on it.

52:05.216 --> 52:06.077
And the man said, yes, it was.

52:06.682 --> 52:18.616
But this came from an old library in the States, and the air freight was going to be so much, it was so rough, it was obviously a breakers book, so I took the covers off.

52:18.636 --> 52:25.323
Of course the reason was the library stamps were on the covers, and all of this stuff had come from Newcastle, well, well, well.

52:25.343 --> 52:33.853
And the trouble was that all these provincial cities used to have book collecting organisations,

52:34.998 --> 52:45.852
It was in the days of mechanics institutes, if you know the expression, when the common man was trying to lift himself up by his books and study.

52:45.872 --> 52:55.285
And so they would have collections, libraries, and good books that people could study in the evenings.

52:55.305 --> 52:56.366
That was the theory of it.

52:56.386 --> 53:00.532
Now, they're all on hard times and they want money.

53:00.552 --> 53:03.956
So they're either selling or having things stolen.

53:03.976 --> 53:04.617
And this is happening every day.

53:04.867 --> 53:12.617
Going back to World War II, when Lord Bond's library was sold out, the motivation there was money, though.

53:12.637 --> 53:13.598
They needed the money.

53:13.638 --> 53:14.459
Whose library?

53:14.499 --> 53:18.785
The one that your father went and... Oh, that was Holland.

53:18.925 --> 53:19.285
Holland.

53:19.305 --> 53:21.688
I thought it was... Well, that was because, of course, of destruction.

53:21.728 --> 53:22.429
Was the name Lord Bond?

53:22.449 --> 53:24.632
I think it was the Bond Library at Holland House.

53:24.772 --> 53:25.533
Was that what you called it?

53:26.455 --> 53:27.115
Lord Holland.

53:27.476 --> 53:28.257
Yes, Holland.

53:30.079 --> 53:30.700
Holland House.

53:32.923 --> 53:34.284
But that was because of destruction?

53:34.425 --> 53:34.705
Yes.

53:35.022 --> 53:35.523
I see.

53:36.144 --> 53:38.867
And that was happening all over the place.

53:38.887 --> 53:40.810
How about immediately after the war, though?

53:40.830 --> 53:44.575
I mean, there were libraries that were sold to generate money, though.

53:44.595 --> 53:45.096
Isn't that right?

53:45.136 --> 53:50.022
There were people in very... There wasn't much money in any way.

53:50.042 --> 53:54.088
No, it was principally, it was destruction, was the point.

53:54.108 --> 53:55.610
I see.

53:55.630 --> 53:58.173
And those libraries were coming up all the time.

53:58.193 --> 54:03.320
And we would go in sometimes just one step ahead of the demolition room.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.742
One step ahead of the demolition room.

54:05.110 --> 54:09.096
which was also very sad.

54:09.116 --> 54:29.866
I remember going to one of those sales in Scotland, and there'd been a great snowfall, and I had stayed a few days beforehand with my aunt, locally, and that gave me chains on our tyres, so I got to the sale, and nobody else did.

54:29.886 --> 54:32.811
But I was so young, I didn't know what to do.

54:32.971 --> 54:34.493
I should have bought everything inside, but I didn't.

54:35.587 --> 54:37.729
I just bought some.

54:37.749 --> 54:40.031
I wish I bought everything now.

54:40.291 --> 54:42.973
Go back on it.

54:42.993 --> 54:44.515
Can you think of anything?

54:45.976 --> 54:48.178
You have spoken to Kenneth Newman, have you?

54:48.458 --> 54:49.179
I haven't, no.

54:49.479 --> 54:50.900
You know him?

54:51.181 --> 54:52.942
Kenneth Newman, though I don't know.

54:52.982 --> 54:54.644
The old print shop, 150, that's his name.

54:55.064 --> 54:55.565
Oh, in New York?

54:55.605 --> 54:57.726
Yes, in New York.

54:57.746 --> 55:01.750
Because his father was the king of the print trade.

55:04.452 --> 55:05.273
And he would sell

55:05.573 --> 55:09.919
extensively, for instance, to Mr. DuPont.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.222
And he became his trusted advisor on prints.

55:14.105 --> 55:19.793
And Kenneth runs the business now.

55:19.813 --> 55:27.384
And they've got their own premises on Lexington, at the bottom end of Lexington, where you hold on to your hand very tight.

55:27.404 --> 55:33.252
But where Lexington makes that ripple that 150 Lexington build prints from.

55:33.940 --> 55:47.654
Can you think of some other people here in London or England that we should be talking to that you'd suggest that might be helpful?

55:47.674 --> 55:50.597
Well, of course, the one to talk to really is Reg Remington.

55:50.657 --> 55:51.718
Have you got him on your list?

55:51.738 --> 55:52.079
Reg?

55:52.519 --> 55:53.040
Remington.

55:53.920 --> 56:00.387
And Remington was Francis Edwards.

56:04.197 --> 56:07.301
Reg Remington.

56:07.421 --> 56:12.689
And he and I grew up together, the contemporaries.

56:13.249 --> 56:14.411
Reg and Philip.

56:14.431 --> 56:16.494
Yes, Philip is the son.

56:16.514 --> 56:17.876
Reg is my contemporary, the father.

56:18.977 --> 56:20.639
And he worked for Francis Edwards.

56:21.981 --> 56:24.224
He's got the biggest firm in travel books.

56:24.244 --> 56:25.606
And he's at Cecil Court.

56:25.987 --> 56:27.829
He's retired very much now.

56:27.849 --> 56:29.952
So if you go there, you would see Philip.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.542
But you remember Francis Edwards and Marlon High Street in those days?

56:36.944 --> 56:38.386
They've since been taken out of the bar.

56:38.826 --> 56:43.893
But if they're familiar together, and Edwards are not familiar with it.

56:43.913 --> 56:46.036
There's Barney Rosenthal's brother right here.

56:46.737 --> 56:46.957
Yes.

56:47.638 --> 56:48.960
Albie, I think his name is?

56:48.980 --> 56:52.104
Yes, the greatest, well, you must see him here.

56:52.124 --> 56:55.589
The greatest, one of the greatest book families in the world.

56:56.770 --> 56:57.932
Can I just give him a call?

56:58.032 --> 56:59.794
There's Barney's salvation there.

56:59.814 --> 57:00.495
Give him a call.

57:01.488 --> 57:03.651
I meant to give Barney a call before I left.

57:03.671 --> 57:05.694
You get his phone number, and here it is, right here.

57:07.156 --> 57:12.124
Can I say, now I've got you face to face, how much I enjoyed your research, you seem to have to know more.

57:13.145 --> 57:13.586
Thank you.

57:14.147 --> 57:14.607
Thank you.

57:14.627 --> 57:17.672
We've learned a little bit more about him since then, of course.

57:17.692 --> 57:20.396
Because that was an extraordinary story.

57:22.199 --> 57:23.200
It's amazing.

57:23.220 --> 57:29.149
How it involved Sir Jeffrey Keynes and Warren Howell.

57:29.382 --> 57:35.811
And I am right, aren't I, that the Crearer Library of Chicago was at the center of that, too?

57:37.173 --> 57:39.115
Not necessarily at the center of that.

57:39.135 --> 57:40.738
Well, very much on it, yes.

57:40.758 --> 57:41.258
But they were involved.

57:41.278 --> 57:42.660
Yeah, they were involved, yeah.

57:42.680 --> 57:48.268
But he didn't buy, Haven didn't buy any stolen books so far, as I know.

57:48.288 --> 57:49.450
Didn't he?

57:49.490 --> 57:57.060
Poor Haskell Norman bought the Crearer Copernicus, through Warren Howell.

57:57.428 --> 58:00.112
That went to Haskell Norman out in California.

58:00.132 --> 58:00.572
Exactly.

58:01.894 --> 58:03.617
But I don't know.

58:03.637 --> 58:05.539
Haven's Copernicus was that wonderful.

58:05.599 --> 58:06.901
The one with the Houghton copy.

58:07.142 --> 58:08.043
I think it was.

58:08.063 --> 58:09.144
Was it the Houghton one?

58:09.164 --> 58:12.209
No, it wasn't the Houghton copy.

58:12.229 --> 58:15.914
It was the famous sale on the Horn, Paris, and Hervor.

58:16.114 --> 58:17.195
Of course, yes.

58:17.316 --> 58:18.698
That disaster sale.

58:18.798 --> 58:19.459
That's correct.

58:20.140 --> 58:20.220
Yes.

58:20.821 --> 58:21.441
Very strange.

58:21.802 --> 58:23.705
But Haven is still around and alive.

58:23.745 --> 58:25.006
Is he really?

58:25.387 --> 58:26.929
So far as I know.

58:27.230 --> 58:31.915
So is this American Negro, but... Do you know that American Negro's name?

58:31.935 --> 58:33.637
Can you think of it?

58:37.622 --> 58:43.949
We didn't hear this story at all, but... He was in a printed online memory.

58:45.712 --> 58:48.094
And he was stealing, as I say, wholesale from Newcastle.

58:50.697 --> 58:52.960
I bet Janet, my friend in Philadelphia, would know.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.263
Literary and philosophical society.

58:55.283 --> 58:55.583
Really?

58:55.951 --> 59:01.578
of Newcastle all the time, Albert Branham.

59:01.718 --> 59:03.680
B-R-A-M-A-M.

59:04.201 --> 59:04.561
B-R-A-M-A-M.

59:04.581 --> 59:05.082
Yes.

59:05.102 --> 59:07.765
And wherever that, if that man is still alive, he's dangerous.

59:08.967 --> 59:10.689
Because he was so convincing.

59:11.370 --> 59:15.254
And I went to his trial in Newcastle.

59:15.274 --> 59:19.279
And he got somebody like Perry Mason to defend him.

59:19.299 --> 59:23.004
And the police prosecutor got the cheapest attorney they could find.

59:25.227 --> 59:25.587
So he got up.

59:25.972 --> 59:35.685
So he got off, and he stood there in the dock, wide-eyed and innocent, and of course a black man, and he mustn't really want to a black man.

59:36.466 --> 59:39.590
And he effectively got off.

59:39.610 --> 59:43.456
The damage that man had done was unbelievable.

59:43.476 --> 59:52.688
Now you've got, let's say, this performance now with Oxford, which has been disastrous.

59:54.136 --> 01:00:00.726
I don't know, there's a colony up there that... Well, they don't know where it's come from, but it's gone missing.

01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:04.712
Oh, sorry, where it's gone to, but it's gone missing.

01:00:04.732 --> 01:00:08.738
You know how the drill is done to you, that we have a hotline on the facts.

01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:13.886
And that each of us has, I think, five names.

01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:19.535
And as soon as we get a fact signal, we multiply it out times five.

01:00:19.595 --> 01:00:23.080
They do the same thing on the... Exactly, so it covers the country very, very quickly.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.904
And it has had some useful arrests.

01:00:28.729 --> 01:00:37.307
They just had a pretty interesting arrest in Boston involving James Gilreath, you know, following the Library of Congress.

01:00:37.888 --> 01:00:40.393
And he came in to, and this one out of me,
