00:01.718 --> 00:12.689
Why not use digital technology to preserve these older materials and avoid fighting with people about copyright?

00:13.390 --> 00:30.207
So it was a natural for preservation to get involved in digital technology because it allowed us to pursue the digitization of printed materials without having to worry about copyright.

00:30.963 --> 00:33.666
because we're dealing with all the materials.

00:33.686 --> 00:35.788
We're dealing with all the material-related materials.

00:36.109 --> 00:37.951
So it was a real good match at the beginning.

00:38.131 --> 00:45.038
And public domain materials and manuscript materials that you own, so there's no conflict here with any... Right, right.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.622
So, you know, that was part of the reason why it came through preservation.

00:48.642 --> 00:59.434
Moreover, because preservation for many, many years as a field has been very much concerned with...

00:59.988 --> 01:06.295
reformatting materials through microfilm, basically trying to save stuff through microfilm.

01:06.315 --> 01:09.038
And microfilm is not that different.

01:09.158 --> 01:18.949
Basically what you're doing is microfilming, taking a picture of something, and then making a copy of the film, or numerous copies of the film, and sending it to different people.

01:19.329 --> 01:23.353
So it's a much more cumbersome book.

01:23.373 --> 01:25.316
I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:25.336 --> 01:26.096
I love this.

01:26.116 --> 01:27.078
I need books.

01:27.098 --> 01:28.459
Are these postcards?

01:28.861 --> 01:29.782
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:29.802 --> 01:30.303
Can I have one?

01:30.383 --> 01:30.904
Yeah, sure.

01:31.104 --> 01:32.607
Yeah, a couple of them.

01:32.627 --> 01:34.409
Oh, I love these things.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.010
May I?

01:35.030 --> 01:37.454
Yeah, sure.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.318
This was actually a competition that we held here in the library.

01:40.619 --> 01:46.127
The university, the kids did these, gave a prize for the, oh, that was the winning prize.

01:49.718 --> 01:54.305
to stop kids bringing pizzas and all the stuff into the library.

01:54.586 --> 02:12.233
But to get back to a comparison between yourself and Stanford, and I'm not trying to put you in the position to make you an apologist or one thing or the other, but it does come to mind where you say that preservation is the controlling department here.

02:12.353 --> 02:17.481
Out there, that may be the case where they're interested in preservation, but I seem to see a

02:17.984 --> 02:20.928
a focus out there of doing new stuff online.

02:21.268 --> 02:26.596
I mean, they even publish books—publish them online without ever even putting them on paper.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.399
Well, this has been happening here, too.

02:31.082 --> 02:34.366
But clearly— That's our preservation.

02:34.686 --> 02:40.674
That's our academic departments.

02:41.135 --> 02:44.059
Stanford's approach has been to develop outside of

02:44.393 --> 02:46.775
I mean, there's a lot of development outside of the library.

02:47.256 --> 02:47.756
Correct.

02:47.777 --> 02:49.258
They even have their own publishing unit.

02:49.478 --> 02:50.840
Right.

02:51.020 --> 02:53.402
Wired on or something like that, whatever it is.

02:53.422 --> 02:54.343
But I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.526
Yes, go ahead.

02:56.546 --> 03:03.513
I think our preservation program has probably been perhaps more powerful, more influential.

03:03.533 --> 03:12.342
And so we've been able to sort of carry the way through.

03:12.929 --> 03:14.652
more than other people have here.

03:16.314 --> 03:31.817
One of the realities about library and archive preservation, wherever it happens, is that it's very heavily dependent on outside funding, writing grant proposals in competition with other institutions and getting money to do the work.

03:31.837 --> 03:42.312
And the reality of certainly research and development on digital imaging technology is that you've got to get money from outside to do it.

03:43.102 --> 03:44.684
So we have a history of doing that.

03:44.704 --> 03:53.332
In fact, over the last few years, this department alone has raised something like $6.25 million for preservation.

03:54.574 --> 03:57.156
And some of that's for... Okay.

03:57.176 --> 04:05.605
Some of that is for... Some of that is for digital technology.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.327
Some of that is for conservation.

04:07.507 --> 04:08.788
Some of that is for microphone.

04:08.808 --> 04:10.510
Anything we haven't covered that you think we...

04:10.726 --> 04:13.148
I don't think so.

04:13.228 --> 04:18.373
If there's anything that comes up that you think of, I can always, you know, just give me, let me just give you my card.

04:18.393 --> 04:19.594
I've got a good mail address.

04:21.175 --> 04:23.778
Thank you for talking to the University Library.

04:23.798 --> 04:27.801
You can just, for the sake of my tape, say your name.

04:28.502 --> 04:32.946
Yes, I'm Sarah Thomas, the Carl A. Kroc University Librarian.

04:35.568 --> 04:36.349
At Cornell.

04:36.809 --> 04:40.092
At Cornell University University.

04:40.510 --> 04:54.125
The Cornell University Library, which is symbolic of the fact that although we have 18 to 19 different libraries here on campus, we are supposed to be one system.

04:55.146 --> 05:08.661
And there's a division, actually, between the endowed libraries, the private libraries, and the statutory libraries, that makes that somewhat challenging to be

05:09.012 --> 05:19.125
part of a single system when there are people who have different budgets and report to deans rather than to the university librarian.

05:19.546 --> 05:36.167
And I mention this because I think it's very relevant when we come to the digital library, because while it's entirely possible, it has been in the past, to be pretty independent

05:36.755 --> 05:41.843
one library to another on campus, one unit library.

05:43.165 --> 05:56.905
Now that we're entering the digital arena, we really have to look, just as we're looking at interoperability between collections nationally and internationally, well, we have that same challenge locally.

05:58.047 --> 06:00.771
How are we formatting our materials?

06:00.831 --> 06:02.774
What's the interface?

06:02.794 --> 06:03.876
Who does what?

06:04.227 --> 06:15.758
And so it raises a number of interesting management questions that then come to play within this university library context.

06:16.299 --> 06:19.922
Now you have, I guess, something in the name of seven million books?

06:21.424 --> 06:25.207
Five point eight, we're going to be crossing into six million in the spring.

06:25.227 --> 06:30.893
Okay, and many, many millions of pages of manuscript, I guess.

06:31.666 --> 06:36.251
I believe you're, what, the tenth largest library system in the United States.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.673
Well, this is interesting, isn't it?

06:38.033 --> 06:42.418
This is quite an assignment that you have here.

06:42.438 --> 06:59.817
Do you have a concept of, you know, you have this huge system at a very prestigious university that is kind of wired, I mean, really at the forefront of all this digital technology and application, and yet you have a marvelous collection of books.

07:00.235 --> 07:03.680
and you are scanning selected rare books.

07:04.401 --> 07:10.509
Do you have a focus of how this all works together as we approach it?

07:10.529 --> 07:12.352
I don't know if that's a question or not.

07:12.853 --> 07:15.036
I'm asking you a comment, I guess.

07:15.076 --> 07:25.450
Yeah, I'd have to say that it's evolving, in part because I've only been here a little over two months.

07:26.172 --> 07:33.021
And I'm still getting acquainted with the staff and with the collections, actually.

07:34.162 --> 07:51.083
Cornell has, as you've alluded to, a very rich, if recent, history, but it stretches back a number of years of involvement with digital initiatives.

07:51.535 --> 07:54.558
Stuart Lynn was a catalyst for that.

07:54.658 --> 08:00.944
He's now out in Berkeley when he was head of the computer center here.

08:01.285 --> 08:20.884
Through Stuart's initiative, I think there were a lot of—he got people involved in exploring and taking risks, and so that's a way that the early digital projects began, whether it's

08:21.185 --> 08:30.994
the math library project with, I'm going to say Xerox.

08:31.014 --> 08:33.316
I think it's C-SPIN Kodak.

08:33.436 --> 08:36.339
Well, we did some cooperation with Kodak, too.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.904
But at any rate, we'd need some fact checking on that.

08:41.964 --> 08:51.073
But partnerships with corporations looking into the viability of scanning materials and creating

08:51.458 --> 09:15.659
digital collections around a theme, the Making of America project, which is subsequent where we've been looking at copyright materials, materials out of copyright from 1850 to 1920, about in that time span, looking at American resources, primarily.

09:15.719 --> 09:21.364
That project, which has been cooperative with the University of Michigan,

09:21.698 --> 09:47.351
has gone on to be, there will be a new phase, Making of America II, Roman II, and that is about to be adopted by the National Digital Library Federation as a sort of test bed for the abstract ideas that the National Digital Library Federation has been considering over the past year and a half.

09:47.371 --> 09:50.355
And those are issues of interoperability and

09:50.690 --> 09:58.798
metadata, selection, access, economic models as well.

09:59.379 --> 10:13.813
Because all of a sudden, as we make this shift from ownership to access that everybody talks about, well, someone has to own the materials in order for everybody else to access them.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.955
If we're doing it cooperatively,

10:16.255 --> 10:18.377
Is it all quid pro quo?

10:18.658 --> 10:28.969
What happens when one person invests, or one institution invests more, and others enjoy that investment?

10:29.369 --> 10:31.752
Shouldn't there be some kind of compensation?

10:32.293 --> 10:36.738
And so we're struggling... Details to be resolved, to be sure.

10:37.118 --> 10:45.267
...with that, and some of it touches librarians' fundamental values of...

10:45.635 --> 10:47.617
What should be made available?

10:47.697 --> 10:50.941
Information should be made available freely to all.

10:52.764 --> 11:02.255
The selection issues that we're grappling with that Ross Atkinson will speak to you in much more detail in the next half hour.

11:02.776 --> 11:12.908
But of all the materials we have, if we have six million volumes, it's unthinkable that we can afford

11:13.411 --> 11:17.298
to digitize all those materials.

11:17.819 --> 11:26.434
Some people, some administration people or other people think that we could just digitize everything and throw them away and not have to have a library.

11:27.856 --> 11:36.071
What is intrinsically special in the character of a library that goes beyond just the content that's in it?

11:36.131 --> 11:37.393
What about the interface?

11:37.627 --> 11:42.952
What's the value that librarians add to this material?

11:42.972 --> 11:44.513
Do you have an opinion on that?

11:44.533 --> 11:54.522
I think librarians are very critical to the success of digital library.

11:54.642 --> 12:06.452
It's not going to be just all an information broker model, a commercial model, but that there is a real

12:07.175 --> 12:24.779
Librarians play a number of important roles, first of all in selecting material, although librarians often declare that they are neutral, that they don't, when they're handing over information to people.

12:24.819 --> 12:28.784
Selecting materials to be acquired or to be digitized?

12:30.186 --> 12:31.508
Maybe it's on a spectrum.

12:32.529 --> 12:35.393
First of all, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's published in the world.

12:35.643 --> 12:37.805
And we only acquire a fraction of that.

12:38.386 --> 12:48.817
You could say that that's a financial limitation, but in fact some of it is not perceived to be as useful or as valuable in terms of research.

12:49.218 --> 12:54.964
But as a university, generally speaking, you try to support the curriculum in a broad way.

12:55.124 --> 12:56.266
Right.

12:56.966 --> 13:02.072
But constantly there we are making choices.

13:02.221 --> 13:06.225
this volume over that volume, this author over that author.

13:06.846 --> 13:14.415
Then we'll be applying, presumably, some of those same selection criteria to digital materials.

13:14.475 --> 13:17.859
What do we want to acquire in native digital form?

13:18.279 --> 13:22.043
What do we want somebody else to maintain?

13:22.744 --> 13:25.027
What do we want to invest in?

13:25.427 --> 13:28.971
How does that relate to our curriculum and research?

13:29.575 --> 13:35.823
So there's that selection component that I think is extremely valuable.

13:35.843 --> 13:58.570
And I think librarians have underplayed perhaps the value of their, not the bibliographic people, not the selectors, but when we describe a quality library, I think that we need to

13:58.870 --> 14:08.286
articulate the intelligence and the care that goes into growing that library and pruning that library appropriately.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.732
So I think that's an important factor.

14:12.793 --> 14:22.650
Then, although catalogers have often had a very bad rap in terms of holding things up, being obstacles,

14:22.850 --> 14:27.116
being rule-bound in a way that is not progressive.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.620
Of course, now you can tell I came out of cataloging.

14:32.342 --> 14:51.928
In fact, I think that the catalogers, the same skills that are involved in organization, description, and analysis in cataloging need to be applied to the whole of electronic resources.

14:52.668 --> 15:22.405
I see some opportunities for us in organizing electronic materials so that they're more useful than, say, some of the automated approaches that are available on Yahoo or InfoSeek or something like that, that that's great for the kind of casual user, or maybe even for the expert user, but what about those people in between who just kind of stumble around and...

15:22.655 --> 15:27.180
aren't really sure that they're finding everything there is or what they need.

15:27.240 --> 15:34.308
And so I think that we have a role to play in helping people.

15:34.348 --> 15:47.523
We take our 100 years of experience or 200 years of experience to organizing materials and say, this is what we found useful in the print world.

15:47.883 --> 15:52.408
What of this do we think applies in a new word where you have

15:52.777 --> 15:55.920
word-by-word access and string searching.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.663
And so it's going to be some moderation.

15:58.743 --> 16:05.209
It's not going to be taking the Anglo-American cataloging rules, God forbid, and applying this to everything on the web.

16:05.789 --> 16:13.177
And I think that there are possibilities for us in terms of, I describe it as a sort of tiered access.

16:13.237 --> 16:20.944
You've got that great unwashed material out there on the Internet that your

16:21.953 --> 16:25.236
Software can help you search and organize.

16:26.077 --> 16:38.650
Then authors may choose to present either abstracts or descriptions of the keywords for their creations.

16:38.750 --> 16:44.857
Then librarians could come along and take a subset of those materials.

16:45.737 --> 16:50.222
What they're especially good at is linking things, where the intellectual

16:50.590 --> 17:00.465
the intellect can do what the computer can't do as much as we keep looking for savings in artificial intelligence.

17:00.485 --> 17:02.929
And then I see other possible connections.

17:03.009 --> 17:09.238
Why not have all the book reviews for your book appended so that people want to see that?

17:09.599 --> 17:15.788
And maybe you'd even have still another area, which is kind of the chat room approach, where people who read your book

17:16.223 --> 17:17.845
commented on it.

17:18.166 --> 17:24.434
I just heard a very interesting talk by Stan Chiodaro from Penn.

17:24.495 --> 17:26.858
He's the provost at the University of Pennsylvania.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.703
He's a medievalist, and he said he studied medieval canon law.

17:31.064 --> 17:45.724
He was making an analogy between medieval writing and writing on the internet, that you started out with a text, and then it was glossed by the various monks or the readers

17:46.025 --> 17:49.189
And so you had all these commentaries running along the line.

17:49.590 --> 18:05.309
And what was important was not so much the person who wrote the first, but it was the same sort of interactive developmental shaping of knowledge and understanding that we have now with some of the research that's shared on the Internet.

18:05.329 --> 18:06.671
So you see that.

18:06.691 --> 18:06.791
Yeah.

18:06.811 --> 18:09.735
And so I think that that's... What's his name again?

18:09.975 --> 18:12.418
Stanley Chowdera.

18:12.519 --> 18:13.600
It's C.H.

18:14.381 --> 18:15.222
I've got to write it down.

18:15.472 --> 18:19.982
O-D-O-R-O-W.

18:20.443 --> 18:21.846
I think that's it.

18:22.207 --> 18:23.851
He's the provost at Penn.

18:24.432 --> 18:25.535
He's a medievalist.

18:26.637 --> 18:29.463
And he got his Ph.D.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.666
from Cornell.

18:33.272 --> 18:33.733
That's very great.

18:34.355 --> 18:39.481
And he just gave a talk at the Association of Research Libraries in Washington, which is where I heard him.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.283
Okay, he discussed this.

18:41.443 --> 18:45.248
And he laid out this and a number of very interesting ideas.

18:45.268 --> 18:48.511
So they might even have a text of this speech, if I could look at it.

18:48.531 --> 18:49.032
That's right.

18:49.112 --> 18:52.896
Yeah, Association of Research Libraries.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.298
Oh, that sounds good.

18:54.318 --> 18:54.538
Yeah.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.342
I'm just looking for all kinds of things like this.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.045
Excuse me.

19:00.065 --> 19:02.067
I'm losing my voice.

19:03.245 --> 19:12.797
I'm sorry, I lost my... This whole, this idea of selectivity, because Cornell also is doing, is scanning a lot of your special collections.

19:13.558 --> 19:15.581
And I'm not, I don't mean just books.

19:16.562 --> 19:19.406
Cornell manuscripts, Ezra Cornell letters.

19:19.987 --> 19:21.268
Yeah.

19:21.689 --> 19:23.191
And that's kind of unusual.

19:23.551 --> 19:24.032
Maybe L.C.

19:24.252 --> 19:26.475
is doing some of that to some degree.

19:27.857 --> 19:33.184
But as John was just saying, you know, what happens if a scholar at some point is doing a

19:33.738 --> 19:54.023
some work on Lincoln, and all that is available is what has been pre-selected in terms of, you know, it's almost like there's a hand, an invasive hand working its way into the role of scholarship.

19:54.043 --> 19:55.405
I don't know, I'm just thinking out loud.

19:55.645 --> 19:56.526
Do you see anything?

19:56.827 --> 20:03.475
Yeah, well, I mean, I think one of the great advantages of digital collections is that

20:03.792 --> 20:31.048
If you look at manuscript materials, first of all, it introduces primary source material to a much wider number of people, that you have the opportunity to take materials that are both rare and often locked away, although here at Cornell we make a practice of involving our students and faculty with these materials,

20:31.568 --> 20:33.570
But you make them much more accessible.

20:33.851 --> 20:35.993
Which is unusual, by the way.

20:36.013 --> 20:42.220
I have to say, very rarely do you see undergraduates encouraged to go to these special collections.

20:42.241 --> 20:47.887
Mark Dimunation will say, oh, you should see them when they want to see the Gettysburg Address.

20:47.987 --> 20:50.590
And we bring out the Gettysburg Address.

20:50.831 --> 20:54.635
They'll bring it to a talk, to a demonstration.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.457
And I think that's wonderful.

20:56.858 --> 20:59.681
Because there's nothing like touching the whole thing.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.423
It's all inspiring.

21:01.707 --> 21:03.889
copy books from Ulysses.

21:04.409 --> 21:08.213
You sort of say, wow, this is Ulysses here.

21:08.773 --> 21:11.416
I think that does as much to inspire people.

21:11.836 --> 21:18.842
It makes a connection between themselves creating something and this person writing something.

21:19.322 --> 21:21.965
You look at letters differently.

21:22.085 --> 21:23.947
You look at diaries differently.

21:24.047 --> 21:30.212
You look at business records differently when you see that they can become part of the archival material.

21:30.597 --> 21:57.921
And then for people, I think that whether you're a student, a high school student, or a college student, or a researcher, or just JQ citizen, when you suddenly can begin to call up some of this material and read it firsthand, you can see the image of the original, so you see whether this person had neat handwriting or messy handwriting, and then you have

21:58.660 --> 22:04.686
ideally a transcription with a word-for-word access, and so you might hit that on a keyword.

22:05.387 --> 22:21.885
It's really an opportunity to provide a sort of unbiased approach to learning, where people are reading the originals possibly for the first time.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.849
Then, if you have the secondary material there,

22:26.234 --> 22:38.313
either through citations to books or through scanned material, then people can begin to dip into that and get some analysis.

22:38.774 --> 22:43.081
But they've already had a chance to formulate.

22:44.043 --> 22:49.812
Often I think we work from secondary and tertiary sources and go back to the primary,

22:50.078 --> 22:57.127
But this seems to me to be an opportunity to introduce that on a level footing, at least.

22:58.008 --> 23:01.812
And I think people react positively to that.

23:03.514 --> 23:09.802
What's your position on acquisitions, particularly in special collections?

23:11.705 --> 23:13.046
Any attitude on that?

23:13.106 --> 23:16.170
Are you acquiring?

23:16.555 --> 23:29.848
I'm told that we are acquiring at a pretty heavy clip because then there are murmurs about storage of materials.

23:30.008 --> 23:41.959
And, of course, when you have these artifactual materials that are themselves intrinsically interesting just to look at the paper and the ink and everything, you don't toss them out after.

23:42.319 --> 23:46.343
It's not like some Blue Cross Blue Shield record where you feel perfectly

23:46.576 --> 23:51.922
happy throwing it out, or IRS even, I suppose, if you had it on disk.

23:52.242 --> 23:54.484
These things you want to keep for all time.

23:55.265 --> 23:58.909
We are still selective.

23:58.929 --> 24:01.532
We're not a vacuum cleaner gobbling things up.

24:01.652 --> 24:11.402
We're looking for materials that either supplement things that we already have in our collection, so we have a big anti-slavery thing.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.985
collection, we would look at that.

24:14.045 --> 24:20.035
We have French Revolution pamphlets and other materials relating to the French Revolution.

24:20.095 --> 24:25.444
Mark tells me it's the largest collection outside of Paris.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.489
So, you know, we would try to acquire something like that.

24:28.509 --> 24:36.563
Things that are special to Cornell history, we would look at, as well as areas to fill in gaps

24:37.268 --> 24:52.587
where we are not as strong, so we have a potential donor of medieval manuscripts, and that's an area where we haven't had a collection as strong as this one that would be coming to us.

24:52.607 --> 25:04.282
And it's certainly, you know, targets of opportunity if you have a nice medieval manuscript collection, you certainly want to have it.

25:04.863 --> 25:04.963
Yeah.

25:07.745 --> 25:12.831
Are there any areas that you feel I should think of anything?

25:13.151 --> 25:23.904
Again, I placed myself at Mark's mercy coming out here, and he did a wonderful job putting together this schedule.

25:23.944 --> 25:31.373
You'll have to forgive me, I got up at 5.30 this morning for the drive out.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.800
I'd love to call you at some point and follow up.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.781
Do you have a card?

25:36.941 --> 25:38.102
Oh, yes, sure.

25:38.142 --> 25:41.806
I thought I'd want a bunch of mine, and I saw one.

25:41.826 --> 25:45.029
If you don't mind, that'd be great.

25:45.049 --> 25:47.911
What I'll do is actually transcribe the tape.

25:48.772 --> 25:50.154
Are you familiar?

25:50.174 --> 25:56.780
You must be familiar, but do you have any comment on this Cambodia project that fascinates me?

25:56.940 --> 25:59.402
I mean, I really know.

25:59.602 --> 26:00.903
almost nothing about it.

26:00.983 --> 26:04.607
I'll have to, you know, get myself informed on it, actually.

26:04.627 --> 26:17.279
Well, I kind of came into it while pursuing the Sarajevo situation where, you know, as part of the ethnic cleansing madness over there, they destroyed the National Library and its collections.

26:17.339 --> 26:22.324
And John Linseth said, well, we should go to Cornell and see what they've done with Cambodia.

26:22.344 --> 26:28.090
I mean, if it's true that, you know, most of their materials were destroyed and that

26:28.677 --> 26:37.390
By this wonderful circumstance, you had the replicative records here that you were able to re-seed the National Collection.

26:37.450 --> 26:39.533
That's quite an interesting story.

26:40.234 --> 26:40.815
Oh, yes.

26:40.915 --> 26:41.756
It's a great one, actually.

26:41.776 --> 26:44.060
And I just can't think of any other parallels to that.

26:44.080 --> 26:53.233
I know they're trying desperately to get things for the Library of Terry Abel and the number of successes they've had here, particularly unique things.

26:53.939 --> 26:58.286
You know, we're a scholar, might have had a microfilm of something that was destroyed.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.989
You know, we can count them on one hand.

27:00.950 --> 27:11.086
But, you know, when I'm considering libraries and books of the future, everything isn't, you know, digital and rosy.

27:11.106 --> 27:16.275
I mean, we still have it within ourselves to commit acts of madness, I guess.

27:17.216 --> 27:18.178
Yeah, yeah.

27:18.198 --> 27:20.942
And destroyed books and people.

27:23.774 --> 27:32.947
Well, the article, the Nicholson-Baker article in The New Yorker recently on the San Francisco public and the weeding of the collection.

27:32.987 --> 27:33.829
I was out there.

27:34.109 --> 27:44.164
In fact, I tried to reach him while I was out there last month, and I'm glad I didn't, because now that was quite a waging thing that I put this on the table.

27:44.344 --> 27:49.191
And one of the things that, when Stanford is doing that,

27:49.475 --> 28:16.410
I've had proposals as I've been going around making my get-acquainted visits to various libraries and schools here that, well, we might want to look into electronic deposit of dissertations, for example, that both from the student's perspective it might be cheaper to have, they already have word-processed their dissertation

28:16.677 --> 28:25.390
And so then the fact that they have to have so many bound copies on acid-free paper and whatever, maybe they would want to move away from that.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.974
It would be a cost savings to the students.

28:28.836 --> 28:36.007
And at the same time, it would solve some of the library's storage problems for these materials.

28:36.087 --> 28:40.333
So that's one area that I think people are looking into.

28:40.413 --> 28:43.478
Do you really need a hard copy of that, for instance?

28:43.677 --> 28:45.039
I can see it.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.084
Somebody was saying the Encyclopedia Britannica.

28:50.847 --> 28:52.429
No sooner is the OED.

28:52.469 --> 28:59.839
No sooner is that published and done does it cost $1,600, but it's essentially obsolete.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.261
There were new words being added.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.062
There were new entries.

29:02.683 --> 29:04.485
That's ideal for a computer.

29:05.026 --> 29:09.572
You can constantly revise it and update it.

29:09.632 --> 29:10.514
I can see that.

29:10.534 --> 29:12.216
As Keller was saying, some of these

29:12.719 --> 29:22.959
These are books that are probably at best published in editions of 600 copies of scientific journals or whatever.

29:23.600 --> 29:28.069
They cost a fortune to buy, and they're obsolete the day they come out.

29:28.570 --> 29:32.397
Maybe these things are better accessed online.

29:32.418 --> 29:34.221
If you want to download it and print it,

29:34.488 --> 29:36.691
Do it on demand.

29:36.711 --> 29:40.116
Yeah, and pay a fee.

29:40.556 --> 29:51.591
And those printers get better as well, so that you have—you're not dealing with some crummy old dot matrix printer, but you've got some high-speed color, highly accurate printers.

29:51.611 --> 29:56.978
They actually punched up some of these cellular things in brilliant, brilliant color.

29:57.098 --> 30:02.065
I mean, it was printed out, and it was quite selectively printed for what you wanted.

30:02.348 --> 30:02.829
Right.

30:02.949 --> 30:06.574
You know, you have to be a fool to say this doesn't have its applications.

30:06.834 --> 30:07.154
Right.

30:07.335 --> 30:08.376
Yeah, so there's that.

30:08.476 --> 30:12.762
And then other suggestions I've had are some of the smaller libraries.

30:12.802 --> 30:16.907
There's a couple that are, I don't know, 15,000 volumes or something.

30:16.947 --> 30:23.295
They're saying, well, you know, why don't we just digitize everything that's not rare in this collection?

30:23.315 --> 30:25.198
Oh, I hope that doesn't matter.

30:25.218 --> 30:31.246
And why don't we, you know, make ourselves the electronic resource in the world for this?

30:31.346 --> 30:32.187
You've read this?

30:32.369 --> 30:33.791
I have, from someone here.

30:34.151 --> 30:36.594
You mean that's been suggested for this university?

30:37.375 --> 30:40.058
For a library on this university.

30:40.639 --> 30:49.710
What I didn't say to the person talking to me was, well, of course there are a lot of copyright considerations that we have to get into.

30:49.730 --> 31:00.283
I think people, they seize an idea, they get a little carried away with this idea, and so they see how it could solve their problem.

31:00.803 --> 31:08.551
space problem or something on that order, and so it becomes a panacea.

31:09.291 --> 31:12.494
Actually, of course, the issues are a lot more subtle to that.

31:12.514 --> 31:20.422
I mean, you have the sort of social and tactile interactions that people have with libraries.

31:21.023 --> 31:26.608
That tends to distill everything about a library down to information.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.685
rather than any emphasis on the knowledge part.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.487
Which is the next level.

31:32.728 --> 31:37.474
And what it does to have real librarians in there.

31:37.895 --> 31:40.758
I'm not quite so old-fashioned.

31:40.838 --> 31:46.566
In fact, I'm advocating strongly that we change and rethink what we're doing.

31:47.047 --> 31:51.152
But I love books just by themselves.

31:51.272 --> 31:56.359
I suppose you'd care to tell me which library that was that wanted to...

31:56.761 --> 31:59.024
I'll turn the machine now.

31:59.044 --> 31:59.685
I'm sorry.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.570
You listened to the Nestle proposal.

32:02.590 --> 32:06.936
Yeah, and I got excited about it because it was a small discipline.

32:08.078 --> 32:09.420
Which is hotel management.

32:09.440 --> 32:21.739
Hotel management, hospitality, literature of hospitality, and I thought it would be an excellent test case of

32:21.905 --> 32:30.175
what it would be like to be a totally electronic library and to be a world resource.

32:30.195 --> 32:35.121
Because if you think about it, Marriott doesn't want to maintain its own library.

32:36.002 --> 32:38.044
Why not just get this stuff?

32:39.646 --> 32:48.216
I don't know much about hospitality, so I don't know whether there are enduring truths or whether there's a...

32:48.348 --> 32:52.112
Nouvelle Cuisine fad every four years or something like that.

32:55.295 --> 32:57.657
The question of, could it be done?

32:57.697 --> 33:00.540
What were the problems in doing it?

33:00.640 --> 33:02.182
What were the copyright issues?

33:02.242 --> 33:04.785
How did you interrelate with the publishers?

33:05.986 --> 33:15.115
Could one library do it all itself, or must it have collaboration and be shared by three or four of the best ones?

33:15.247 --> 33:33.525
And so it's an intriguing idea to consider, but I guess it just seems a little too simple to me to think, well, how would we do that?

33:34.506 --> 33:45.237
And yet sometimes when I've worked with developing countries and they've wanted to

33:45.537 --> 33:50.503
their idea of heaven is to have a lot of paper journals.

33:50.523 --> 34:00.876
And you know how expensive it is and the problems they have in maintaining appropriate conditions in some climates and things like that.

34:01.296 --> 34:11.989
Then you sort of say, geez, wouldn't it be nice if they could leapfrog over all the problems we're having and go electronic for some of these materials.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.953
But they're sort of...

34:15.288 --> 34:24.803
still trying to catch up to a stage that we were, you know, maybe when they were doing their graduate training or whatever, that was what impressed them.

34:25.303 --> 34:29.250
And so sometimes it's hard to do that.

34:30.051 --> 34:35.179
And we're bound by the ties that people have.

34:35.239 --> 34:42.510
And so you have to ask yourself when you're running a library like this, gosh, well, if I had $30 million

34:43.165 --> 34:58.849
Brighton, which might be our budget now, $25 to $30 million, to set up something de novo for the Cornell campus, how would I spend that money?

34:59.130 --> 35:02.435
It would probably be very different from the way we're configured now.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.799
And so we have traditions.

35:04.919 --> 35:10.928
Some of those traditions are important to the fabric of the campus.

35:11.262 --> 35:16.972
They're very meaningful, quite independent of the service they provide.

35:17.012 --> 35:23.705
And then there are traditions of service which have been held for a long time and which are still valuable to carry forward.

35:24.165 --> 35:34.384
But there are probably other things which we could jettison and replace with something else, except for the fact that there's always someone out there

35:34.651 --> 35:38.135
who clings to that particular service.

35:38.175 --> 35:43.461
So you have an open mind to this, or has this been pretty much resolved that that's not what they're going to do with Nestle?

35:43.801 --> 35:49.948
Oh, it's still very much a gleam in somebody's eye.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.310
That's right, yeah.

35:51.330 --> 35:54.553
I mean, we haven't embarked on any planning to do this.

35:54.573 --> 35:57.476
It's one idea of many that have been floated.

35:57.777 --> 35:59.679
And how many volumes do they have?

35:59.759 --> 36:03.443
I think they have 15,000.

36:05.431 --> 36:10.459
Interesting.

36:10.479 --> 36:13.203
And, of course, you could say hotel management, you know.

36:13.223 --> 36:18.091
I mean, then others would say, well, now today, hotel management, tomorrow.

36:18.972 --> 36:20.855
Tomorrow is Shakespeare, you know.

36:21.737 --> 36:22.999
Tomorrow is Shakespeare, that's right.

36:23.119 --> 36:25.683
That's right, you know.

36:25.703 --> 36:27.466
I mean, people would say that.

36:27.486 --> 36:33.295
And, you know, I straddle the fence of somebody who's an administrator.

36:33.646 --> 36:43.760
who is always looking at the cost-effective ways to do things and trying to be in a leadership position where I have to keep my eyes five to ten years out.

36:44.421 --> 36:48.207
And then there are the people down there in the front lines who have to do the job for today.

36:48.287 --> 36:53.294
And so I've come out of that world.

36:53.454 --> 36:56.859
I still have a great allegiance to that world.

36:57.199 --> 37:01.105
But at the same time, I feel it's my responsibility to be...

37:01.439 --> 37:03.628
evaluating these ideas that come up.

37:03.748 --> 37:06.379
What's practical and what's harebrained?

37:06.881 --> 37:08.930
Sure, that's the job.

37:09.231 --> 37:11.500
So what would you do if you had $30 million?

37:11.615 --> 37:17.443
That's for another time.

37:17.483 --> 37:20.247
You have to talk to Ron.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.932
I may look tired, but I feel like you can question it, too.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.354
Yeah, yeah.

37:25.574 --> 37:26.516
Should we put on that one?

37:26.776 --> 37:28.418
Yeah, let's do that.

37:28.438 --> 37:32.864
So, if you'd kindly, just for the tape, just identify yourself at the front of the tape.

37:33.025 --> 37:34.907
Cameron Ross Atkinson?

37:35.127 --> 37:35.588
Yes, sir.

37:36.109 --> 37:37.871
Associate University of Auburn at Cornell.

37:38.052 --> 37:38.252
Good.

37:38.272 --> 37:39.474
And you've been here how long, sir?

37:39.794 --> 37:40.575
I've...

37:40.910 --> 37:42.131
I've been here for eight years.

37:42.171 --> 37:45.614
Before that I was at Iowa, and before that I was at Northwestern.

37:46.755 --> 37:49.398
Were you at Iowa when the Zathmari Collection came?

37:49.418 --> 37:50.258
Oh, yes, sure.

37:50.278 --> 37:51.039
That's in my book.

37:51.279 --> 37:51.760
Oh, really?

37:51.900 --> 37:52.540
Oh, yeah.

37:52.781 --> 37:53.782
I heard he just died.

37:53.802 --> 37:55.343
He died about three weeks ago.

37:55.363 --> 37:55.703
Yeah.

37:55.883 --> 37:59.467
Gee, that's... And I was supposed to go out and say, I have my plane ticket.

37:59.487 --> 38:03.170
I was going out to see him in Chicago next two weeks.

38:03.190 --> 38:04.351
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

38:04.451 --> 38:05.192
Yeah.

38:05.352 --> 38:08.094
If you have a chance to see my book, I write about him.

38:08.234 --> 38:08.875
I'll look at it.

38:09.395 --> 38:10.496
Okay, I'll have to look.

38:10.517 --> 38:12.900
Well, of course, the Iowa Zahmari collection.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.985
I wrote about Steven Blumberg, you know, the book Thief.

38:17.005 --> 38:17.806
Yes, that's right.

38:17.826 --> 38:20.450
I wrote a definitive chapter on him.

38:21.231 --> 38:22.573
It's a fun book, I'd say.

38:22.593 --> 38:23.334
It's a lot of fun.

38:24.155 --> 38:30.804
So, I guess you've been here while this whole digital revolution has been kind of coming in.

38:30.924 --> 38:31.245
Sure.

38:33.388 --> 38:36.231
What aspects of that interests you?

38:36.492 --> 38:38.895
All of it.

38:39.432 --> 38:41.214
Well, okay.

38:41.374 --> 38:45.860
Let's have an entry point.

38:45.900 --> 38:53.990
Why don't you give me an overview of Cornell's role here, what Cornell's attitude is?

38:54.010 --> 38:59.918
How is it that this is recognized as one of the very top leading institutions?

38:59.938 --> 39:04.764
Well, I mean, I think we've done a number of things.

39:04.784 --> 39:08.308
There are several institutions in the country that

39:08.913 --> 39:13.939
have done some experimentation and have tried to move that into production.

39:13.959 --> 39:31.961
Our main effort has been in the area, I think, of digitizing paper materials, which is probably what would be of more interest to you, as opposed to, I mean, there are materials that begin their lives in electronic form, and there are materials that are digitized, obviously, that begin their lives in paper.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.823
And the real challenge

39:35.137 --> 39:57.077
It's a whole new form of collection building, in a sense, and it is to figure out, of all the materials that are in paper form, which ones we want to digitize, which ones do we want to make, in a sense, contemporary or competitive with digital materials, with materials that begin their lives in digital form.

39:57.117 --> 40:04.384
And it's quite a—it's a whole new area that nobody's really done much work in yet.

40:05.242 --> 40:16.180
The selection, how do you decide what's going to be preserved and what isn't?

40:16.340 --> 40:18.003
I mean, there are two levels of that.

40:18.043 --> 40:24.274
I mean, there's a higher level in which a certain amount of that depends on funding.

40:24.554 --> 40:31.806
I mean, large amounts of preservation in the country are done through grants, large programs.

40:32.275 --> 40:35.038
And what you can get grant funded is what you preserve.

40:35.138 --> 40:38.242
And normally what you can get grant funded are your real strong collections.

40:38.682 --> 40:43.207
So what we've got are individual real strong collections around the country that are preserved.

40:45.149 --> 40:47.732
But they're not comprehensive.

40:48.273 --> 40:50.576
I mean, they're strong, but they're not comprehensive.

40:50.596 --> 40:51.677
So you can get money for that.

40:51.697 --> 40:53.559
You can't get money for your day-to-day things.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.342
And those we have to take out of our regular budget.

40:56.422 --> 40:57.864
And a certain amount of that gets done.

40:58.565 --> 41:00.747
But most of that preservation has been microformed.

41:01.317 --> 41:04.180
I mean, we're just now moving into the digital side of things.

41:04.300 --> 41:11.707
And we can't get much money for that yet, because the funding agencies don't feel it's a stable enough medium yet.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.829
There's no standards.

41:14.130 --> 41:19.075
They can't say, well, I'll give you this money if you do these things, because those things haven't been determined yet.

41:19.355 --> 41:26.662
We don't know about archiving digital material yet.

41:26.682 --> 41:29.485
We don't know if we're going to have it next year, let alone in 100 years.

41:30.089 --> 41:32.332
So there's all that work that still has to be done.

41:32.352 --> 41:34.935
And that's what a lot of libraries are working on right now.

41:34.955 --> 41:36.957
You know, you talk about paper.

41:37.818 --> 41:40.141
Let's face it, you're absolutely right.

41:40.922 --> 41:44.647
Things on paper have survived for centuries, haven't they?

41:44.687 --> 41:45.808
Printed books.

41:46.429 --> 41:54.719
And if they're treated properly, and you've got one of the finest preservation units here anywhere, they can last for another 500 or 1,000 years.

41:55.019 --> 41:57.362
So it has to be demonstrated

41:57.865 --> 42:08.397
that these items on paper are very fragile and are better preserved on microchips, which are only 20 years old.

42:08.837 --> 42:09.678
Right, that's right.

42:10.359 --> 42:17.507
I mean, the advantage is that if we can shift them to electronic form, we can move them around a lot better.

42:17.527 --> 42:19.890
We can make them a lot more accessible to a lot more people.

42:20.731 --> 42:25.476
The standard argument for special collections is, of course, you take pressure off of the paper materials.

42:25.996 --> 42:30.381
I'm sure Tom Hickerson will tell you that, for manuscripts or anything else.

42:31.281 --> 42:40.811
And you can store them, if they're in electronic form, increasingly more cheaply.

42:41.032 --> 42:47.558
I mean, we add two-and-a-half or three miles of shoving a year in this library.

42:47.759 --> 42:49.661
And we're just a normal research library.

42:49.721 --> 42:52.003
I mean, that's year after year after year after year.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.780
And major research libraries do that.

42:54.800 --> 42:59.025
And there's coming a point here where that really can't go on for too much longer.

42:59.045 --> 43:01.027
We're running out of landscapes.

43:01.327 --> 43:04.511
You actually add two and a half to three miles of shelves?

43:07.374 --> 43:08.315
We don't add the shelves.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.537
We add that many books that fill those shelves.

43:10.798 --> 43:12.339
And so, I mean, we don't do that every year.

43:12.399 --> 43:15.763
But, I mean, we have to have enough shelves every year.

43:16.115 --> 43:17.838
to do that, if I'm making sense.

43:17.878 --> 43:21.344
I mean, there's got to be— Oh, so there must be the accessioning steps for that.

43:21.364 --> 43:22.485
We don't do that much.

43:22.606 --> 43:24.088
I mean, we're running out of shelf space.

43:24.108 --> 43:28.034
When we build extra shelves, we do compact shelving and so forth.

43:28.054 --> 43:32.301
But the point—the trustees have now come back and have told us, no more on Central.

43:32.341 --> 43:33.964
Beyond the year 2000— No more what?

43:34.204 --> 43:36.288
No more shelves on Central campus.

43:36.348 --> 43:37.650
Beyond the year 2000,

43:38.255 --> 43:40.925
Five million volumes on central campus is enough.

43:41.447 --> 43:45.904
If you want any more, you're going to build it out in the orchard, and we're building a storage facility.

43:45.945 --> 43:47.370
And you're pointing to it.

43:47.620 --> 43:48.741
What's called the orchard?

43:48.901 --> 43:50.963
The orchard, off-site, off of the campus.

43:50.983 --> 43:51.744
Is that what it's called?

43:51.764 --> 43:53.706
Do you own a former orchard?

43:53.726 --> 43:54.447
Yeah, yeah.

43:54.527 --> 43:56.268
It's not a former orchard.

43:56.348 --> 43:56.989
It is an orchard.

43:57.049 --> 43:57.790
It's an apple orchard.

43:57.810 --> 43:59.011
It's a working orchard.

43:59.051 --> 43:59.672
That's right.

43:59.692 --> 44:03.315
So that's where we're now building an off-site facility out there.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.157
See, I visited the Harvard Department.

44:05.297 --> 44:05.817
Oh, yes.

44:05.838 --> 44:06.818
That's exactly the same.

44:06.838 --> 44:08.760
I live about 10 miles from here.

44:08.961 --> 44:09.221
Oh, yeah.

44:09.321 --> 44:10.242
That's typical.

44:10.262 --> 44:11.123
I spent a day there.

44:11.183 --> 44:12.244
I guess that's the Model 1.

44:12.384 --> 44:13.084
That's right.

44:13.465 --> 44:13.645
Yeah.

44:13.928 --> 44:15.530
And boy, what a thing that is.

44:15.550 --> 44:19.114
Each one of these little units can hold two and a half million books.

44:19.174 --> 44:20.315
Yeah, it's fantastic.

44:20.476 --> 44:22.338
And they can build 20 of these.

44:22.358 --> 44:24.400
They could, but they're unbrowsable.

44:24.761 --> 44:27.684
In other words, you've got to know what you want before you get it.

44:27.744 --> 44:29.987
I mean, they're not in call, you can't pull a thing out and look at it.

44:30.007 --> 44:35.473
Oh, no, and in fact, he told me, the guy told me, he said, if I had the Gutenberg Bible, it would have a barcode on it.

44:35.833 --> 44:39.057
Yeah, I wouldn't know, nobody would know what's in that box.

44:39.097 --> 44:39.938
That's right.

44:40.058 --> 44:42.501
And the letters come in that morning,

44:42.937 --> 44:47.041
They're punched up on the computer, and the guy goes out on the forklift, and they just pick him up by number.

44:47.101 --> 44:52.427
The computer tells him where to go and get them in order, and then they go into Boston or Cambridge, and that's that.

44:53.948 --> 44:57.311
So the scholar has to know, I want that book and that book and that book.

44:57.392 --> 44:58.733
Oh, no, there's absolutely no browsing.

44:58.793 --> 44:59.794
Right, right.

44:59.814 --> 45:02.777
And so we've lost, I mean, we're going to lose that ability.

45:03.037 --> 45:09.544
I mean, for people to go into stacks and browse around and see everything, there's just not enough stack space left.

45:09.984 --> 45:12.707
And it's going to hurt historians more than any place else.

45:12.940 --> 45:13.561
anyone else.

45:13.601 --> 45:23.790
So I think there's a sense that maybe if we digitize more of this material, we'll get back some of that browsing capability that we're going to lose by sticking that paper offside.

45:24.151 --> 45:27.354
So how do you stand on this issue?

45:27.374 --> 45:27.954
Long term.

45:28.174 --> 45:40.386
I mean, right now we're stuck in that time between having enough of electronic material that can be browsed and having enough space for the paper material.

45:40.506 --> 45:42.728
So somehow we've got to get to that transition.

45:43.332 --> 45:53.430
Well, on the question of, you know, five million books, that's it.

45:54.352 --> 46:01.264
And then we're going, and then anything added after that has to be on electronic.

46:02.145 --> 46:03.949
Well, no, it's got to be off-site.

46:05.111 --> 46:06.994
Anything beyond that has to be off-site.

46:07.177 --> 46:09.079
So you have 24 hours to bring it in.

46:09.119 --> 46:09.640
That's right.

46:09.740 --> 46:11.883
That's the turnover they have at Harvard.

46:11.943 --> 46:12.544
Yeah, yeah.

46:12.664 --> 46:13.145
Oh, okay.

46:13.165 --> 46:14.566
And they're much further away.

46:14.606 --> 46:15.347
They don't have an Apple.

46:15.387 --> 46:17.210
They figure, we can do it within 24 hours.

46:17.290 --> 46:19.212
If you want it today, you've got to pay us $100.

46:19.793 --> 46:23.117
I mean, money has to change from one account to another.

46:23.177 --> 46:23.738
They'll do it.

46:24.900 --> 46:28.444
But they promise it will be there within 24 hours.

46:28.464 --> 46:31.087
But these are largely dead books that are out there, too.

46:31.107 --> 46:32.609
Dead books.

46:32.629 --> 46:33.150
Dead books.

46:33.248 --> 46:38.557
Well, there is no such thing as a dead book at Harvard, number one, in that they don't deaccession.

46:39.058 --> 46:41.843
But on the other hand, they put stuff out there that there's no call for.

46:43.165 --> 46:46.331
And they'll be sure that there's no call for by putting it out there in a way.

46:46.591 --> 46:54.485
However, the computer will tell them if an item is called for, if there's a frequency of demand, then they'll reconsider its location and it goes back.

46:54.565 --> 46:58.632
So, I mean, I think there's a system in place that allows for that.

46:59.118 --> 47:06.069
One of the problems we have is that the catalog is online, as you know.

47:09.114 --> 47:12.560
But we haven't quite converted all of those cards.

47:13.341 --> 47:17.367
And the kinds of cards we haven't converted are the low-use items.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.896
And those are precisely the kinds of things we need to send off-site.

47:22.956 --> 47:25.260
So when we send it off-site, we convert the cards

47:25.645 --> 47:30.769
We put the cards in the catalog, and that increases the use of those same materials that we're sending off-site.

47:30.789 --> 47:37.515
In other words, by sending them off-site, we're increasing the use because we have to make the records more accessible.

47:37.695 --> 47:40.217
It's a problem.

47:40.237 --> 47:44.501
Are these for you exciting times to be a librarian, or frustrating times?

47:44.881 --> 47:55.450
Well, obviously it's going to be both, but I mean, the decisions we're making now are going to have an effect on what people have available, on what people know long-term.

47:55.987 --> 48:01.794
I mean, people will use what we provide them in the future, and they won't use what we don't.

48:02.235 --> 48:08.963
And we're making all kinds of decisions now, we have to, that are going to affect what people will have access to in the future.

48:10.765 --> 48:14.910
Do you have any kind of a visceral feeling for the printed book?

48:16.052 --> 48:17.433
A visceral feeling?

48:17.634 --> 48:25.183
Well, I mean, you know, as a bibliophile, can you be moved by handling a book

48:25.400 --> 48:31.188
in a way that you can never be moved by grabbing a text off a screen.

48:31.348 --> 48:36.696
I think it's a different kind of experience.

48:37.176 --> 48:41.342
I mean, you can also be moved in another way by grabbing a text off a screen.

48:41.362 --> 48:43.825
I mean, there are other things that the screen can do that the book can't do.

48:44.246 --> 48:48.452
But there is a... Now, the question is whether that's a generational thing.

48:48.512 --> 48:54.360
In other words, it's because we've grown up with these and you get used to having things in your hand and relating to them.

48:54.610 --> 48:57.293
and the next generation won't deal with that or not.

48:57.313 --> 48:57.753
I don't know.

48:58.153 --> 49:00.796
Also, these things are not very convenient.

49:01.457 --> 49:07.743
I mean, I'm assuming in 20 years that something will... that you'll be able to read more easily off one of these things.

49:07.763 --> 49:07.863
Yeah.

49:07.883 --> 49:09.104
You know a single person?

49:10.245 --> 49:15.210
Can you name me a person who has read a novel, first page to last off a computer?

49:15.230 --> 49:15.290
No.

49:15.310 --> 49:15.490
No.

49:16.211 --> 49:18.614
And in a way, that's not what they're for.

49:18.974 --> 49:22.137
They're for storage and for transmission.

49:22.943 --> 49:25.186
And then you print from them.

49:25.206 --> 49:31.794
I mean, many people have said if you were smart at the beginning of the electronic revolution, you would have invested in paper.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.938
Because, I mean, we have more paper now.

49:34.958 --> 49:37.281
There's more paper production than, I think, than ever before.

49:37.301 --> 49:38.342
I mean, we've got it everywhere.

49:39.003 --> 49:40.805
Because you need to print it out.

49:40.845 --> 49:41.226
That's right.

49:41.446 --> 49:44.350
There has been no cut down.

49:44.370 --> 49:45.371
Quite the opposite, I think.

49:45.411 --> 49:47.093
It's created more paper.

49:47.113 --> 49:50.878
So it's just a matter of sort of self-on-demand publication.

49:51.138 --> 49:52.680
I mean, I know when I'm home and I'm

49:53.048 --> 49:54.029
browsing stuff.

49:54.990 --> 50:00.056
And, you know, I pay a flat rate, so I'm not paying extra time.

50:00.076 --> 50:01.757
And I see something, bang!

50:01.817 --> 50:02.798
I don't fool around.

50:02.818 --> 50:03.079
I read it.

50:03.099 --> 50:03.679
I print it out.

50:03.699 --> 50:03.940
Sure.

50:03.960 --> 50:10.607
And I'll put it in a file, and I'll spend four hours at night just printing stuff off the computer.

50:10.627 --> 50:12.048
Do you read what you printed out?

50:12.229 --> 50:15.552
Oh, it's research material from, you know, I'll be scrolling.

50:15.572 --> 50:22.920
I don't have time to read every San Francisco Chronicle article on the San Francisco Library, but I'm able to find them.

50:23.660 --> 50:34.819
And, you know, fine, print it out, but let's get the material today and then let's read what we have and underline it, you know, and extract the information that's useful to me as a writer tomorrow.

50:35.180 --> 50:38.966
I mean, people photocopy stuff in the same way, I think, in the library.

50:38.986 --> 50:41.731
And that's how I photocopied the research from my book.

50:41.751 --> 50:43.975
I did all of my reading at Harvard there.

50:43.995 --> 50:47.842
And I couldn't, you know, my ticket was for reading up there.

50:47.902 --> 50:49.144
I couldn't take the stuff home.

50:49.613 --> 50:51.035
I copied like crazy.

50:51.095 --> 50:53.037
I'd go in with $40.25.

50:53.137 --> 50:56.501
You don't have time to read there.

50:57.142 --> 50:59.145
You're doing 15, 20 books.

50:59.705 --> 51:03.470
You just print these pertinent chapters, and then you take them home.

51:05.673 --> 51:09.197
So that's just another aspect of that, I guess, altogether.

51:10.339 --> 51:17.207
I think what we're wondering about in libraries is where does the library

51:20.663 --> 51:22.586
I mean, what's the long-term future of the library?

51:22.987 --> 51:26.754
Do you need a library when you can do that kind of thing?

51:27.575 --> 51:29.478
You can build your own collection, in a sense.

51:29.558 --> 51:32.083
I mean, you're printing things off and creating your own collection.

51:32.103 --> 51:33.345
You're doing your own selection.

51:33.986 --> 51:39.516
I mean, do you need a library between you and that information with a good network, long-term?

51:39.596 --> 51:42.301
As a researcher, probably not.

51:42.421 --> 51:44.224
Assuming everything's available.

51:44.609 --> 51:46.872
And it may be too expensive— Now, that's a bold assumption.

51:46.912 --> 51:48.174
Yeah, to make everything available.

51:48.834 --> 51:50.236
That just may not be cost-effective.

51:50.256 --> 51:54.362
I mean, you've got six million books here, 75 million pages of manuscript.

51:54.902 --> 51:59.128
Not in my lifetime, is that all that stuff going to be available online?

52:01.231 --> 52:04.315
You know, maybe not in anybody's lifetime.

52:04.335 --> 52:13.907
No, but that may mean that that paper material is read less and less, and that the real action shifts to what's in electronic form.

52:14.309 --> 52:19.256
and it will become increasingly expensive to maintain large paper collections.

52:20.058 --> 52:30.072
So Cardale was pretty firmly committed, then, to making this work by the year 2000, is that right?

52:30.493 --> 52:39.827
All we're committed to is not to have any more books on Central Campus by the year 2000.

52:40.364 --> 52:42.366
I mean, we'll move those books off-campus.

52:42.386 --> 52:44.509
So no decisions that we made beyond that?

52:44.529 --> 52:44.909
No, no.

52:47.973 --> 52:56.502
But you can tell me pretty much for sure is that within four years there will be no more than five million books on the central campus.

52:56.562 --> 52:57.203
That's it.

52:57.443 --> 52:57.964
That's right.

52:57.984 --> 53:00.867
As far as they're going to be digitized and this and that.

53:01.007 --> 53:07.194
Yeah, I expect most of them are going to be in the Apple Orchard Inn in a storage facility like the Harvard one.

53:07.835 --> 53:09.477
But we've had to explain.

53:09.676 --> 53:14.602
The trustees have asked for a lot of explanations as to why do we need all these books.

53:15.163 --> 53:16.404
More and more people are asking that.

53:16.464 --> 53:18.466
Why do you have to have six million volumes?

53:18.787 --> 53:19.448
What's your answer?

53:19.628 --> 53:21.350
Well, it's not easy.

53:25.815 --> 53:27.097
Research requires it.

53:27.277 --> 53:28.378
History requires it.

53:30.220 --> 53:34.165
Why the country has to have this many items is not

53:35.478 --> 53:36.600
is not hard to answer.

53:36.680 --> 53:37.902
Why do we have to have it here?

53:38.263 --> 53:41.809
And sort of the same ones are in Harvard and sort of the same ones are in here.

53:41.990 --> 53:46.618
Well, there's an overlap between one of the ten largest libraries in the United States.

53:46.939 --> 53:50.345
Okay, but those ten largest libraries probably have a certain amount of overlap.

53:50.565 --> 53:52.028
Probably have a tremendous amount.

53:52.048 --> 53:54.612
Okay, do we need ten copies in those ten different libraries?

53:54.632 --> 53:56.676
Or do we...

53:58.192 --> 54:03.379
You don't need ten copies in all those different libraries assuming that a digitized copy is available here.

54:03.399 --> 54:10.589
But if there's only one copy and that's out at Palo Alto, that's a pain in the butt if a student needs it today, isn't it?

54:10.769 --> 54:11.089
It is.

54:11.530 --> 54:18.359
Unless we develop a form to— That's defeating the whole purpose of printing, which was to duplicate copies, when you think about it.

54:18.439 --> 54:18.740
Right.

54:19.821 --> 54:27.051
Unless we can digitize on demand somehow, which would be an enormous service and an enormous cost.

54:28.685 --> 54:32.209
I mean, we're going to have large paper libraries for some time.

54:32.689 --> 54:52.110
And I'll tell you, the items that are going to survive, if you're a paper person, if the material is before the machine press period, if the material is up to 1800, I feel strongly, it's fairly clear.

54:52.732 --> 54:54.675
that those are going to be considered artifacts.

54:54.695 --> 54:55.857
Those aren't going anyplace.

54:55.877 --> 54:57.680
I mean, everybody's going to save those things.

54:57.780 --> 54:59.763
Every library that has one is going to save it.

55:00.104 --> 55:01.306
It's the materials after 1800.

55:01.326 --> 55:01.866
1800?

55:02.007 --> 55:04.851
I would say, yeah, when the machine press starts.

55:05.372 --> 55:12.303
I mean, when you—and suddenly there's this flood of materials that are out there, and I think those are—what we're going to lose are materials between 1800 and 2000.

55:12.844 --> 55:17.391
Lose in terms of the paper object, in terms of the artifacts.

55:17.411 --> 55:19.414
Yeah, well— Lose forever.

55:19.478 --> 55:20.940
Yeah, lose forever.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.604
I mean, I think there will be a certain amount of that material that's going to be lost forever.

55:24.644 --> 55:27.627
Doesn't that concern you as a librarian?

55:27.647 --> 55:28.187
It does.

55:28.247 --> 55:30.450
It does on the one hand.

55:30.550 --> 55:31.291
It concerns me.

55:31.311 --> 55:34.034
On the other hand, we've never saved everything.

55:34.714 --> 55:41.842
I mean, what concerns me more is having some kind of method that's effective that will allow us to ensure that the most important things are retained.

55:41.862 --> 55:44.625
That you've got a scale of values that will allow us to

55:45.685 --> 55:46.526
to retain those.

55:46.566 --> 56:02.928
Now, I was just having a conversation with our history bibliographer here, and he suggested that he would be happier if we lost material by serendipity than if we lost material by specific system of weeding.

56:02.948 --> 56:11.119
Well, that almost suggests, you know, a form of cultural fascism, if somebody's going to say this survives and this doesn't.

56:12.753 --> 56:14.837
I go with the serendipity.

56:15.037 --> 56:15.839
Okay, okay.

56:15.879 --> 56:18.744
That's almost the process of natural selection, you know.

56:18.764 --> 56:24.735
Okay, and I can see what, but that's a product of, I mean, that's a value of the time.

56:24.855 --> 56:29.243
If I went back to antiquity, how many plays of Aeschylus do we have?

56:29.323 --> 56:30.505
We have eight plays.

56:30.906 --> 56:35.554
Well, I can even, you know, go, Melville was detested in his lifetime.

56:36.142 --> 56:40.627
If what you're suggesting happens, then Moby Dick would have disappeared.

56:40.687 --> 56:42.409
It would have, and we're lucky it didn't.

56:42.429 --> 56:49.877
But a lot of stuff has disappeared because places, I mean, every era saves what it thinks is important because you can't save everything.

56:50.277 --> 56:52.480
But then people are discovered in later ages.

56:52.980 --> 56:53.601
They are.

56:53.681 --> 56:57.505
They are.

56:57.605 --> 57:04.613
But the thing is, assuming that you can't save everything, and you can't save every graphic utterance, I mean, there's got to be some...

57:04.998 --> 57:06.079
You can't, no.

57:06.379 --> 57:06.960
I agree.

57:07.220 --> 57:08.261
I was taking the train.

57:08.281 --> 57:14.706
I'm from New York, you know, and only I drive, and I'm writing in my notebook about this, and I'm looking at the graffiti out there.

57:14.826 --> 57:16.368
I said, is all this worth preserving?

57:16.408 --> 57:17.028
This is writing.

57:17.629 --> 57:18.630
Somebody's writing this.

57:18.650 --> 57:21.872
Somebody's defacing, actually, violating it.

57:22.233 --> 57:30.480
Should we, because it's written, should we preserve it, or should we go clean it off and put the kid's ass in jail if we catch him doing it, you know?

57:30.780 --> 57:33.022
So I'm agreeing with you, I guess, to a degree.

57:33.322 --> 57:34.363
Everything isn't worth it.

57:34.580 --> 57:35.882
preserving it.

57:35.902 --> 57:41.748
So, I mean, libraries really have to figure out that they've always had that responsibility of what's going to make it through.

57:41.768 --> 57:43.150
So it is historic in that regard.

57:43.290 --> 57:49.698
They have, and they've always based those decisions on cultural values, and our values now are relativistic.

57:49.718 --> 57:55.164
So we're willing to say, well, everything is sort of of equal value, so let's just save things by chance.

57:55.344 --> 57:56.345
That's sort of serendipity.

57:56.365 --> 57:58.268
I mean, it's a product of our times.

57:58.728 --> 58:02.072
Just as there was a time, you know, a thousand years ago when

58:02.322 --> 58:04.767
If it was non-Christian or whatever, you wouldn't save it.

58:04.847 --> 58:05.668
Yeah, that's right.

58:05.748 --> 58:10.898
A historian is not a stenographer.

58:11.118 --> 58:22.800
There is selectivity that has to be done, and I think the same skills have to be exercised on the living of the life of the library.

58:22.820 --> 58:25.866
So my sense is what's at risk is materials between

58:26.470 --> 58:31.836
you know, 1800 and 2000, where we've got this huge, just enormous amount of things that are sitting around.

58:31.856 --> 58:35.401
And the paper is poorer at that time than before, obviously.

58:37.443 --> 58:45.413
I think you're actually going to see a lot of books written on, you know, I mean, Stanford University Press is doing things like that.

58:45.593 --> 58:46.514
Yeah, they are, yeah.

58:46.694 --> 58:48.296
Where it's not even coming out of paper.

58:48.537 --> 58:48.917
It's going to be

58:49.589 --> 58:53.480
And you'll never see another Oxford English dictionary printed in paper.

58:53.500 --> 59:02.805
And it's better, because the words, as soon as that thing hits the streets, there are ten words entering the language every day, whatever the number is.

59:03.460 --> 59:08.286
you know, maybe it's better to look up a word of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

59:08.306 --> 59:08.706
That's right.

59:08.807 --> 59:11.490
It's constantly being updated, which is great in a way.

59:11.630 --> 59:13.753
And it's less expensive to revise.

59:13.833 --> 59:14.093
It is.

59:14.273 --> 59:15.795
Historically, it's a problem.

59:15.955 --> 59:17.718
And it's easier to access.

59:18.038 --> 59:20.601
You can't go back and say what was known at this time.

59:20.882 --> 59:21.022
Yeah.

59:21.042 --> 59:25.587
Do I have to buy a whole Encyclopedia Britannica if I want to look up on Amadillo?

59:25.607 --> 59:28.551
I mean, you know, let me just punch up the Amadillo for tonight, you know?

59:29.172 --> 59:30.774
I think that's, you know what I'm saying?

59:30.794 --> 59:30.954
Right.

59:30.974 --> 59:33.417
I do know what you're saying, but...

59:33.768 --> 59:42.380
The other point is, I mean, when there's a paper edition, they come out periodically, and you can save that edition, and you can say, this is what was known in 1970 about the Armadillo.

59:43.001 --> 59:47.267
Okay, you can't do that anymore because it's constantly, you lose all of that history.

59:47.567 --> 59:54.017
As a writer, there's no such thing as drafts and variant texts anymore.

59:54.117 --> 59:56.780
You know, my book probably had 150 drafts.

59:56.861 --> 59:57.722
I have no idea.

59:58.142 --> 01:00:01.307
But the only draft I have is the one that went off to publish.

01:00:01.407 --> 01:00:02.188
The final one.

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:05.903
printed when I ran it through the printer.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:08.346
Yeah.

01:00:08.707 --> 01:00:10.229
History will pay for this.

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:13.254
Our ability to do history, I think, will be affected.

01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:21.247
And it probably still... I mean, the debate is not by any means concluded, I think.

01:00:22.048 --> 01:00:22.609
Which debate?

01:00:22.629 --> 01:00:27.737
You mean on... The general debate on this issue that we're talking about, just how this is going to

01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:30.610
You think that electronics will win over that?

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.734
I think economically we won't have a lot of choice.

01:00:34.154 --> 01:00:40.102
I think we'll have to make a number of compromises because it's just too expensive to do it otherwise.

01:00:41.684 --> 01:00:49.573
I agree with you, but I also think that works of the imagination, novels, poetry, they will always be printed in books.

01:00:50.718 --> 01:00:54.583
For so long as I went, I just can't imagine a work of art.

01:00:54.603 --> 01:00:54.883
It is.

01:00:55.104 --> 01:00:56.625
I think so, too.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.589
It's just they may not be stored or moved around in books.

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:06.298
I mean, they may be stored in electronic form and sent down to you in electronic form, but they'll come out.

01:01:06.318 --> 01:01:09.442
You'll still read it in paper form because that's the most convenient.

01:01:09.502 --> 01:01:10.844
You think so?

01:01:10.864 --> 01:01:15.710
Yeah, it's too expensive to send it through the mail, and it's too expensive to warehouse that.

01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:17.552
I think it would...

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:21.113
But it still costs less to buy a book than it costs.

01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:23.677
I mean, it costs $5 to digitize a page.

01:01:23.857 --> 01:01:25.880
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:31.147
I mean, the word on the street is that's going down, you know, geometrically.

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:31.748
Is that right?

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:36.494
Now, I don't know if that's the case, but it's certainly a lot less expensive than it was a few years ago.

01:01:36.514 --> 01:01:37.476
That's historic.

01:01:37.496 --> 01:01:38.237
I mean, everything.

01:01:38.497 --> 01:01:43.664
So at some point, it should be incredibly inexpensive to maintain this material.

01:01:44.145 --> 01:01:47.269
But libraries will have to ensure that there's backup, there's archiving...

01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:55.363
that we don't lose, that the software and hardware don't change so that you can no longer read the material.

01:01:55.423 --> 01:01:59.291
I mean, all of that is a future of libraries, and we have to learn as much about that as we can.

01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:05.163
You know what, I think I've had my half hour, and could you give me a card or something if I could get in touch?

01:02:05.203 --> 01:02:07.468
Well, look, we just ran out.
