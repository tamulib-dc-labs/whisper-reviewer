WEBVTT

00:03.541 --> 00:04.624
Okay.

00:04.844 --> 00:07.491
Why don't you just put your name on there so I know when I listen to your name?

00:07.511 --> 00:07.711
Right.

00:07.771 --> 00:16.352
This is Catherine Tussinger at the Electronic Text Center with a C. Let me grab you one of my cards before you leave.

00:17.665 --> 00:24.574
We're talking about a collection of manuscripts and letters that the library received this summer.

00:26.096 --> 00:35.648
They were basically written by two brothers, Jimmy and John Booker, who were soldiers from Virginia during the Civil War.

00:36.389 --> 00:42.036
We have about 22 manuscript letters written by the brothers and a bit of surrounding material.

00:42.758 --> 00:50.309
some pages from Bibles that record family information, and some fragments of letters that are either unidentifiable or not dated.

00:50.890 --> 00:58.741
And what we've done is to create high-quality archival TIF images of all the manuscripts.

00:58.761 --> 01:00.503
That's an image file format.

01:02.406 --> 01:09.576
T-I-F-F is sort of the official name, but images in the TIF format will have a dot T-I-F.

01:09.809 --> 01:16.318
And it is one of several raw image file formats.

01:16.338 --> 01:21.445
It doesn't compress or process the image data at all, which means the files are very big.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.249
But it also means that they're fairly universal.

01:24.289 --> 01:25.992
They can be opened by any image editor.

01:26.933 --> 01:30.878
And this is an example of a page out of one of the Bibles to the family records.

01:31.399 --> 01:32.401
So what's that?

01:32.421 --> 01:33.342
That's a fragment?

01:33.422 --> 01:34.804
This looks like a tear.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.449
And so the page underneath it is the Bible.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.812
That's right.

01:40.033 --> 01:44.523
Now, what we have here are poor quality photocopies of that Bible.

01:44.944 --> 01:46.647
We don't actually have the Bible.

01:47.108 --> 01:55.948
The descendant of the bookers who donated the letters originally, or maybe never had it, had some sort of early photocopied version of it.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.963
That's all I know at this point.

01:58.744 --> 02:10.614
The letters themselves, we have the actual manuscripts, and we shot images of them at 400 dots per inch resolution, 24-bit color, on the flatbed scanner.

02:11.415 --> 02:25.126
We then had, this again is part of David's Rare Book School course on electronic text production this summer, we transcribed the letters, marked them up in SGML, so we have a structured tag.

02:25.827 --> 02:26.087
SGML meaning?

02:26.371 --> 02:29.382
standard generalized markup language.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.939
I'll show you an example of it.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.706
It's a way of

02:36.378 --> 02:40.425
describing classes of information in a document to make them meaningful.

02:40.725 --> 02:51.784
So you can mark a dateline in a letter as a dateline, a date as a date, a valutation as a valutation, a closer as a closer, a proper name as a proper name.

02:52.385 --> 02:55.631
An extension of this would be in a work of literature, for example.

02:55.671 --> 02:58.336
You could mark a chapter in a novel as a chapter.

02:58.356 --> 02:59.638
Mark it in a text itself.

02:59.798 --> 03:00.018
Right.

03:00.459 --> 03:02.082
Could you illustrate something?

03:02.348 --> 03:03.870
Yes, let me finish.

03:04.150 --> 03:07.294
Let me just save this before I lose it.

03:07.714 --> 03:10.237
Is this something that was developed here?

03:10.257 --> 03:10.758
Oh, no.

03:10.798 --> 03:11.999
It's a universal.

03:12.159 --> 03:18.807
It's a standard established decades ago, and it's supported by the International Standards Organization.

03:19.168 --> 03:23.332
We use one class of SGML tagging.

03:24.254 --> 03:31.562
We subscribe to the TEI guidelines, text encoding initiative guidelines, which...

03:32.453 --> 03:46.252
It's a given subset of SGML, which is most appropriate for marking up text from the humanities, for example.

03:46.693 --> 03:53.302
Now, you may have heard of HTML, which is the markup language used to create documents for the World Wide Web.

03:53.763 --> 03:57.027
That's another subset of SGML, the same thing.

03:57.665 --> 03:58.907
That's hypertext.

03:58.927 --> 04:01.311
That's right, hypertext markup language.

04:02.874 --> 04:19.302
Now, what we do is create these high-quality archival digital images in the TIFF format so that we will have a version of the image that records with pretty much as much information as today's technology makes possible.

04:19.433 --> 04:24.526
Now, these images themselves are no good for delivery over the web because they're so big.

04:25.208 --> 04:30.903
What we then do is make a derivative of this image in the JPEG format.

04:31.224 --> 04:32.828
And let me just sort of open one up for you.

04:33.289 --> 04:36.177
JPEG is simply another image format.

04:36.460 --> 04:42.946
which uses a compression algorithm to make the file smaller.

04:42.966 --> 04:48.091
So the image looks exactly the same on a computer monitor, but it will be much smaller.

04:48.111 --> 04:50.734
That's not the actual size of the image, of course.

04:50.834 --> 04:54.978
The actual size of the image is 576 pixels by 745.

04:55.098 --> 04:58.141
How do you know that?

04:58.181 --> 04:59.222
It tells me right in there.

04:59.262 --> 05:03.126
We're in an image editor known as SV, which is designed for the

05:03.106 --> 05:11.998
So this is nothing I can at home call up and see.

05:12.278 --> 05:12.539
True.

05:13.400 --> 05:21.891
However, what you can call up and see, and let me get something else rolling here.

05:22.259 --> 05:33.041
is the way we publish these letters in digital form on the web through our website as part of our online library collection of electronic text and digital images.

05:33.061 --> 05:35.145
So that's as text or as an image?

05:35.165 --> 05:35.426
Both.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.270
We have the transcription of the text.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.753
Now let me sort of back up a little bit.

05:39.093 --> 05:42.360
So we begin by creating these high-quality images

05:42.340 --> 05:47.146
which we can manipulate if we need to if we're having a hard time transcribing them.

05:47.487 --> 05:55.557
We need to make, say, some of the letters more distinct or less distinct, if possible, in an image tool such as this.

05:56.599 --> 06:01.545
I'm going to exit XV right now because it's preventing me from getting all of my colors here in Nescape.

06:02.847 --> 06:08.274
Now, this is our top-level homepage at the Electronic Text Center.

06:08.855 --> 06:11.098
You simply use a web browser.

06:11.855 --> 06:14.540
and type in the URL.

06:14.560 --> 06:14.880
Thank you, dear.

06:14.900 --> 06:27.122
Let me get you a brochure.

06:27.142 --> 06:34.996
Pardon me?

06:35.016 --> 06:36.218
I mean, I love languages.

06:36.238 --> 06:36.799
You're welcome.

06:37.133 --> 06:41.640
Now, as I mentioned, all of our texts are encoded in SGML.

06:54.681 --> 07:04.677
That gives us the ability to record detailed structural information about the data and also to give us a little bit more flexibility in terms of data retrieval.

07:05.298 --> 07:13.408
It allows us to index and search various elements in the book.

07:13.468 --> 07:23.981
So if you would like to search in one of our collections, say, only works of poetry or only the appendices to works, you can only do that if those elements are tagged as such.

07:24.642 --> 07:34.174
So using a different flavor of SGML than HTML, using TEI, for example, gives you much more power and flexibility with the tagging language.

07:35.065 --> 07:41.918
I'll show you an example of how these letters might end up for the collection.

07:48.349 --> 07:54.400
These are several projects from various rare book school classes.

07:54.421 --> 07:56.905
We're still continuing to build this page.

07:56.925 --> 07:58.508
What we've done then is had

07:58.758 --> 08:02.269
David's students transcribe the letters, mark them up in SGML.

08:02.711 --> 08:11.299
Another crucial element to our workflow is that we fill out a bibliographic header for every one of our electronic texts, which records information about

08:11.583 --> 08:34.722
the creation of the electronic text, the print source that was used to derive the electronic text, and that header gets passed directly onto the cataloging department here in the library, where it's turned directly into a MARC record and becomes part of the library catalog.

08:35.309 --> 08:47.642
Then, after the Rare Book School course was over, two graduate students on our staff here in the Electronic Tech Center wrote some surrounding contextual material that helped users understand the context for the collection.

08:50.365 --> 08:53.528
It's a fairly discreet collection.

08:53.668 --> 09:03.038
That's right, which actually makes it perfect for a short teaching span such as these two one-week courses that David was teaching.

09:03.406 --> 09:06.549
the bibliographic header which gets converted into the MARC record.

09:06.689 --> 09:11.854
Another aspect of this process is the EAD project.

09:11.914 --> 09:14.556
This is a grant project that we're involved in.

09:14.576 --> 09:17.819
It's the encoded archival description project.

09:19.541 --> 09:26.267
We are working in a partnership with Berkeley, Stanford, and Duke in the first phase of this project.

09:26.988 --> 09:31.692
And what it is is an attempt to establish

09:31.790 --> 09:40.156
an SGML model for encoding and making electronic searchable versions of finding aids.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.065
I don't know if you're familiar with finding aids.

09:43.282 --> 09:49.671
They are pretty much the list of items in an archival collection.

09:51.574 --> 09:57.463
For example, the book or letters were donated to the library or were purchased by the library as a unit.

09:57.843 --> 10:05.695
Depending on their history, if we had gotten them from another library or whatnot, at some point, somebody would have written a finding aid for this collection.

10:06.080 --> 10:11.809
Now, finding aids... Finding aid in terms of helping the researchers determine if this is something that I need to support.

10:11.829 --> 10:12.450
That's right.

10:12.811 --> 10:16.497
And they have a wide range of what a finding aid may or may not contain.

10:16.617 --> 10:23.749
Some of them contain a 10-page thesis on the history of the person who put them together and a detailed list of the content of each item.

10:24.010 --> 10:30.400
And some are a mere handwritten list of, you know, 12 photographs, black and white, without describing any content.

10:30.667 --> 10:38.501
So the challenge is to create... This is all something I can access, all this history that you've got.

10:38.521 --> 10:38.881
That's right.

10:38.901 --> 10:44.391
This is all publicly accessible, where we talk about the creation and our workflow issues here.

10:45.152 --> 10:53.687
And so the students in the Rare Book School class also created a record, an encoded archival description of this collection.

10:53.971 --> 11:21.227
which is now part of a large consortium, so that if you were a researcher researching Civil War soldiers, you could come here and type in the Civil War or Gettysburg, and in an ideal world, if all archives were to transcribe and mark up their finding aids and put them into a common collection, then you could find all the archival resources around the states that had potential materials of interest to you.

11:21.950 --> 11:27.576
The electronic texts are broken down by date.

11:28.096 --> 11:38.266
You can look at a transcription of the original version of the letter with all of its erroneous spelling and quirky habits of the reader.

11:38.767 --> 11:42.691
What we're looking at here is that bibliographic header I was talking to you about.

11:42.991 --> 11:48.717
So it tells us who created the electronic version, who created the digital images, who marked

11:48.933 --> 12:12.237
the electronic text up in TEI, the fact that the library published it, the URL for the page, any notes about the electronic texts that are worth recording, information about the print source, when it was originally written or published, and then a list of any revisions that have been made after the original transcription and marker was completed.

12:12.397 --> 12:17.522
This is part of the

12:17.671 --> 12:20.876
part of our goal as a library department.

12:20.896 --> 12:25.643
The Electronic Tech Center serves two main roles here at the university.

12:25.663 --> 12:33.676
On the one hand, we do build and maintain the library's online collection of humanities and social sciences text.

12:33.696 --> 12:45.214
So electronic text and digital images that go with them in the humanities and social sciences are collected on our server as part of a globally searchable index database of electronic text.

12:45.599 --> 12:57.988
The other part of our function here is to build up and support a user community, people who know how to use and know how to create electronic text and digital images.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.975
And so this course combines both of those goals

13:01.360 --> 13:19.154
in one function where we're training people how to do this stuff so that ideally they would want to go on to produce research scholarly projects that contain or make use of electronic text and digital images and at the same time they're helping to build up our collection of online resources.

13:19.635 --> 13:23.402
So I'll show you our online collection in just a moment.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.707
And then what we have here then is... Oh, no.

13:29.048 --> 13:30.009
Tons of printed books.

13:30.029 --> 13:35.237
And in fact, the largest project we're involved in right now is an NEH-funded grant project.

13:36.058 --> 13:39.003
It's called the Early American Fiction Electronic Archive.

13:39.463 --> 13:46.434
And we are transcribing and marking up in SGML about 500 titles, about 450 models.

13:46.454 --> 13:47.295
Transcribing meaning what?

13:47.375 --> 13:49.178
So you're not scanning the books?

13:49.659 --> 13:49.899
Nope.

13:49.919 --> 13:52.022
What we've done in terms of workflow is...

13:52.373 --> 13:58.741
to take a high-quality image, full-page image of every page and leaf of every book.

13:58.821 --> 14:00.203
And I can show you this in a moment.

14:00.263 --> 14:12.379
We are then shipping those images off to a commercial keyboarding company who's transcribing the books, marking them up in SGML, and then we will have a final product.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.021
By individual keyboarders.

14:14.822 --> 14:18.246
Who's checking to see if they've made mistakes?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.324
models for this.

14:20.524 --> 14:25.172
These commercial keyboarding companies are all over the world and there are different systems of workflow.

14:25.232 --> 14:43.525
The one that we have chosen to go with uses a system where two different people key in the text from the digital images discreetly and then a third person has a computer screen that's split in half that measures one against the other and every time

14:43.960 --> 14:45.341
There's a discrepancy.

14:45.742 --> 14:50.927
That person goes back to the digital image, the third person, and looks to see which one is appropriate.

14:50.947 --> 14:52.629
So there's a degree of quality control.

14:52.749 --> 14:53.250
That's right.

14:53.330 --> 14:57.114
And they pretty much guarantee one error per 20,000 characters.

14:57.234 --> 14:59.516
So it's about one error per 20 pages.

14:59.536 --> 15:01.598
That still gets why that procedure?

15:01.638 --> 15:02.299
That's right.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.301
So there'll still be an error that gets in.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.103
That's right.

15:06.243 --> 15:10.608
But that's a better accuracy rate than you would ever get through OCR scanning.

15:10.948 --> 15:11.168
Ever.

15:11.569 --> 15:11.969
Okay.

15:12.610 --> 15:12.870
Ever.

15:13.508 --> 15:16.312
I thought scanning didn't give you an exact image.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.578
Oh, well, scanning an image does, but not text scanning.

15:21.018 --> 15:25.024
Text scanning would give you about anywhere from five to a hundred times that error rate.

15:25.064 --> 15:27.046
So are you keeping the original book?

15:27.066 --> 15:27.407
Oh, yes.

15:27.487 --> 15:30.231
The original book is part of our special collections department downstairs.

15:30.571 --> 15:39.343
These are all works of American fiction, first editions published between 1775 to 1850 from the Barrett collection.

15:39.503 --> 15:39.984
That's right.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.706
So is the goal to get all of those books?

15:41.887 --> 15:42.267
No.

15:42.466 --> 15:47.533
Let me show you what the final product will look like.

15:47.673 --> 15:54.001
We have a webpage for the Early American Fiction Project that's accessible by anybody, and you can read a little bit more about it.

15:54.722 --> 16:00.209
With the manuscript material, this is a transcription of the original letter itself.

16:00.390 --> 16:03.594
Again, with such quirks as that such is is one word.

16:06.117 --> 16:09.942
You can look at this has been deleted, this word in red.

16:10.799 --> 16:15.950
see how the letter Y has been added here, the signature, what not.

16:15.970 --> 16:27.373
And then we have included a full color page image of each slip of the manuscript so users can compare and have access to the rare manuscripts without having to be here in the library.

16:27.910 --> 16:33.255
If I want to see that letter, though, I think that one will still have to see it.

16:33.275 --> 16:34.936
I don't know exactly what the policies are.

16:35.116 --> 16:44.444
It depends on who you are and what your purpose is and the value of that particular archival object.

16:44.464 --> 16:57.495
We've also transcribed a modernized version where we have modernized all of the spelling so that people who are searching with a 20th century sense of language would be able to find the kinds of things that they're looking for.

16:58.066 --> 17:02.092
And so we've regularized the spelling and modernized several different features of it.

17:02.673 --> 17:09.804
And the reason why this is important is because, again, all of these letters are in fact searchable.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.708
And every word is indexed.

17:12.728 --> 17:17.796
And what we have done is to include them as part of our Modern English collection.

17:18.265 --> 17:24.237
So if you are starting at our homepage, I went into projects and publications because this is a special project that we're working on right now.

17:24.537 --> 17:31.111
But our online library of electronic text contains text in five different languages, including searchable Japanese.

17:32.032 --> 17:39.868
And our English collection is the largest because we have built our collection almost exclusively by user demand.

17:40.237 --> 17:55.153
either collected electronic text that are made by faculty and students here or elsewhere, and they've deposited them with us for markup in SGML, or we have created text at the behest of a faculty member, say, for a particular .

17:55.173 --> 18:02.581
So we don't really have an agenda in building up a particular kind of collection, and most of our users happen to be interested in text in English language.

18:03.321 --> 18:06.405
We have also purchased a number of commercial resources.

18:07.266 --> 18:09.568
These, for example, are five databases

18:09.835 --> 18:18.026
published by, well, these four, anyway, are products of the Chad McKayley Publishing Company, and they put out these products on CD-ROM.

18:18.807 --> 18:27.179
What we will do is we will negotiate a license with the company to purchase the content, the data, rather than the CD-ROM itself.

18:27.579 --> 18:35.550
So they will send us tapes with the text already encoded in SGML, and we will mount them on our server instead of having a CD-ROM.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.374
The beauty of that is then our users can...

18:38.725 --> 18:40.607
That's right, and they can use them off the bat.

18:40.707 --> 18:45.552
So if the library's closed, they can search English poetry in the middle of the night if they want to.

18:46.053 --> 18:46.273
Is it used?

18:47.214 --> 18:51.699
We get about 1,000,000.3 hits a month, about 40,000 hits a day.

18:52.519 --> 18:55.763
There's no way to measure how much of that is from the university?

18:55.843 --> 18:56.203
Oh, yes.

18:56.283 --> 19:01.829
We get anywhere from 4% to 12% of use from the university per day, depending on the season.

19:01.849 --> 19:08.496
In the summer, university traffic's a little slower than it is, say, in the middle of the fall or the spring.

19:09.269 --> 19:17.681
So the range we get about between 5% and 15% is sort of a safe range to say is UVA traffic on any given day.

19:18.583 --> 19:33.825
And the other benefit, this is also a strong feature of our collection, the other benefit to purchasing the data of commercial products and mounting it on our own server is that we only have one search interface for every single one of our products.

19:34.143 --> 19:40.654
And so users don't have to learn how to use 12 different CD-ROMs and search them all discreetly.

19:40.674 --> 19:42.257
They can search these things together.

19:42.297 --> 19:44.721
They only have to learn how to use one interface.

19:45.322 --> 19:51.452
And then as we add new things, they don't have to learn anything new, but they can apply that same knowledge to different collections.

19:51.592 --> 19:56.320
So the Modern English Collection is sort of a hodgepodge of things that we've created ourselves.

19:56.705 --> 20:00.129
things that other people have created and deposited with us.

20:00.209 --> 20:07.238
If we were to, for example, want to find those book or letters, if you came to the B page, you could browse them and you could download them one at a time for viewing.

20:08.380 --> 20:18.772
Every one of our texts, which is greater than 100 kilobytes, is automatically broken down into a table of contents where you can look at the book chapter by chapter.

20:19.654 --> 20:24.079
Now, the beauty of this is that if we had just had HTML files, you can't do this.

20:24.481 --> 20:25.342
kept the whole book.

20:25.362 --> 20:25.823
That's right.

20:25.883 --> 20:30.690
But because we've been able to mark a chapter as a chapter, we can retrieve one part at a time.

20:30.750 --> 20:31.752
Can you try one?

20:32.133 --> 20:32.433
Sure.

20:32.994 --> 20:36.960
This may or may not have images.

20:37.020 --> 20:37.601
I'm not sure.

20:37.681 --> 20:40.265
So if it doesn't, it's fairly straightforward.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.208
So that indicates the page.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.910
In the print source.

20:43.930 --> 20:44.411
That's right.

20:44.932 --> 20:52.243
And because in that bibliographic header we recorded what print source we're talking about, you can interlibrary loan that same edition.

20:52.510 --> 20:55.314
and then use this in conjunction with the print source.

20:55.334 --> 21:03.044
It's always been our bearing that electronic texts are not intended to replace print sources.

21:03.065 --> 21:04.887
They're intended as research material.

21:04.927 --> 21:08.151
To give you access to something you can't get.

21:08.192 --> 21:09.473
You sure could.

21:09.493 --> 21:20.188
Because what we have done, if you look at the header, is whenever possible we'll include the call number of the book that we used to create the text.

21:20.742 --> 21:30.618
This is the edition, The Man Between, by Amelia Barr, published by the Authors of Newspapers Association, New York, London in 1906.

21:30.798 --> 21:33.382
This is the first edition.

21:34.023 --> 21:40.895
And so you get a sense of what the print source is, and you could actually cite this and say, in this edition on page 10, this is a quotation.

21:40.935 --> 21:43.539
What are these revisions under this page?

21:43.559 --> 21:45.943
Somebody else created this text.

21:46.163 --> 21:47.425
In fact, it was...

21:47.658 --> 21:55.432
A professor at Ole Miss made the electronic text and saved it as the word perfect file, cleaned and corrected, then shipped it to us.

21:55.452 --> 22:00.201
And what we did to that text was we added this header and we added the TEI tag.

22:00.281 --> 22:08.856
And so we record what we were responsible for here and what Charles Keller was responsible for originally.

22:12.903 --> 22:19.394
This way, if you were not able to have access to this book in print source, you could, if you wanted to, read the entire novel online.

22:19.995 --> 22:27.367
Or if you didn't want to do that, you could sort of search for certain quotes here, and then if you decided you wanted to read the text, you could interlibrary loan it or something.

22:28.048 --> 22:38.725
So it's not intended to replace necessarily reading a book off of the staff, but it's intended to increase access and furthermore make searching possible.

22:39.650 --> 22:45.359
At the top of every one of these pages in most of our collections, you will see a link to the search tool.

22:46.781 --> 22:56.917
And if we wanted to search the Modern English collection, you can either do a simple search or a compound search.

22:56.937 --> 23:02.245
You can search for a word or a phrase because every word has been indexed, even stock words.

23:02.365 --> 23:06.231
So, you know, and, or, for the, everything has been indexed.

23:06.616 --> 23:18.148
You can search all of the works in the Modern English Collection, or you can choose to search just, say, descriptions of illustrations, just publishers' names, just prose, just drama, just speeches and drama.

23:18.168 --> 23:20.650
You don't have to search characters' names or stage directions.

23:21.151 --> 23:28.438
So say we wanted to search just descriptions of illustrations, which is a part of the SGML tagging that we encode here.

23:28.458 --> 23:33.383
We write descriptions of illustrations that are included.

23:35.236 --> 23:49.518
If we knew, for example, that Horatio Alger had an illustrated book in our collection, we could limit this by author and just search Alger, or just search Whitman, or search the title of the book, Moby Dick, for example.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.601
Or a date range.

23:51.621 --> 23:53.304
We could do 1800 through 1900.

23:53.324 --> 23:55.528
So let's see.

23:55.828 --> 23:58.392
Now most of these texts, in fact,

24:01.409 --> 24:05.855
are published before, say 1920, because of copyright restrictions.

24:05.875 --> 24:06.275
That's right.

24:06.295 --> 24:08.878
So we don't have too much in the later part of the 20th century.

24:09.679 --> 24:17.829
And the few things that we do have permission to publish that are in copyright are almost always available only to the University of Virginia.

24:18.670 --> 24:26.600
Now it looks like we have one match searching for seashore within descriptions of illustrations in works published between 1800 and 1900.

24:27.061 --> 24:27.922
That's right.

24:27.942 --> 24:29.284
This is a beautiful work, actually.

24:29.304 --> 24:31.146
We have a wonderful illustrated version.

24:31.430 --> 24:38.000
When you click on that link, it takes you to a little surrounding context page, so you can see a little bit more of what we're talking about.

24:38.040 --> 24:46.632
At this point, you could choose to download just the header to find out what exactly is the work we're talking about, just the page on the work where that illustration occurs.

24:47.013 --> 24:48.835
Now, it's giving me an illustration.

24:49.176 --> 24:49.757
It sure is.

24:49.777 --> 24:50.578
Because that's what we asked about.

24:50.598 --> 24:51.038
That's right.

24:51.659 --> 24:56.647
And if you click on this little thumbnail, you get a bigger version, so you can zoom in a little bit more.

24:57.388 --> 24:58.049
Isn't that nice?

24:58.109 --> 24:58.990
I can do this at home.

24:59.729 --> 25:01.291
For this text you can.

25:01.411 --> 25:03.353
For most of the collection you can.

25:03.413 --> 25:14.425
There are a few works that are not publicly accessible, so you would only be searching a subset of the collection, but you're perfectly welcome to use the search tool at any time.

25:18.369 --> 25:19.731
Is the word seashore in there?

25:20.071 --> 25:23.215
The word seashore is not in the printed text.

25:23.235 --> 25:28.200
Somebody on our staff looked at this picture and wrote a 25-word description.

25:28.771 --> 25:31.356
based on the content that she or he saw.

25:31.376 --> 25:32.978
So there may be other seashore pictures.

25:33.199 --> 25:33.820
That's right.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.902
That's right.

25:35.002 --> 25:42.776
So what you would want to do is something like maybe potentially, or sea even, because... That's right, shore is kind of limited.

25:43.337 --> 25:48.826
And the way our words are indexed, any word beginning with sea will get picked up.

25:48.986 --> 25:52.753
So sea or seashore should get picked up equally.

25:53.898 --> 26:18.792
and we do try to maintain a kind of common vocabulary right so it'll list the author and the work so there are four examples in little lord faulroy a bunch of ancient mariners that's right what else do we have stephen crane richard harding davis dickens several times doyle lots of doyle illustrations of the sea hugo

26:19.160 --> 26:21.548
And so once again, it sort of works in the same way.

26:21.688 --> 26:27.988
All of our search tools follow the same pattern, where here you get a little bit of keyword and context when you click on this

26:28.323 --> 26:36.193
selection, you get a sense of what you're looking at, and you can choose to download the chapter, the full text, just the header.

26:36.454 --> 26:38.677
Now, are these books scanned here?

26:38.697 --> 26:39.638
Again, we set these up.

26:39.818 --> 26:40.519
It's hard to say.

26:40.599 --> 26:47.548
Much of what we have, we don't spend a lot of time generating electronic text ourselves because we just don't have the resources.

26:47.989 --> 26:53.136
But a text like this was scanned, this was scanned by the same fellow at Ole Miss.

26:53.156 --> 26:55.579
He scanned and corrected and proofread the text.

26:55.846 --> 27:02.036
We got a copy of the same edition of the book and scanned all the images here ourselves on a flatbed scanner.

27:02.416 --> 27:05.020
Once again, it's 400 dots per inch, 24-bit color.

27:06.182 --> 27:08.306
Yeah, it's pretty good.

27:09.748 --> 27:13.374
So you get a sense of, you know, what the actual text might have looked like.

27:15.076 --> 27:18.782
And...

27:19.066 --> 27:20.989
Is this a kind of project?

27:21.570 --> 27:26.557
Do you have a target number of checks that you're putting on?

27:26.737 --> 27:30.623
We're just trying to keep up with things that people send us and projects that we've got going.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.906
Two other things, let me just show you quickly.

27:33.026 --> 27:40.056
This link here, announcing the Electronic Archive of Early American Fiction, is that NEH grant project I was telling you about.

27:41.218 --> 27:42.660
That's right.

27:42.826 --> 27:47.752
There were several criteria, three criteria that we used to put together the list of texts that we were going to do.

27:47.772 --> 28:02.431
They had to be in BAO, in Wright's Bibliography of American Literature also, and part of the Barrett collection, because we actually wanted the source text here on site, so that we wouldn't have to borrow them or anything.

28:02.531 --> 28:09.660
So there's a list of the authors and titles, and we can take a look at the sample text, the kinds of quality we're getting.

28:09.927 --> 28:17.738
Now, because these are rare books that we're dealing with in old materials, it's a little risky to scan them on a flatbed scanner.

28:17.998 --> 28:21.263
So what we have done is to purchase two high-quality digital cameras.

28:22.404 --> 28:23.927
Let me just show you the cameras first.

28:25.429 --> 28:29.995
We had a craftsman here in Charlottesville build special book cradles.

28:31.190 --> 28:33.093
Well, so you're still going to get some red pages.

28:33.674 --> 28:34.214
That's right.

28:34.274 --> 28:37.139
So this is the cradle, and there are two little clips that sort of hold it down.

28:37.479 --> 28:42.626
But there's a fair amount of curvature, depending on if the book ever got wet or how stiff the binding is or whatnot.

28:43.047 --> 28:46.252
So we do film each one of these pages on the digital camera.

28:47.213 --> 28:53.742
But we're scanning the covers and the spines on a flatbed scanner at the same settings.

28:54.263 --> 28:58.429
And what I can show you here is...

28:59.067 --> 29:00.589
what SGML looks like.

29:00.609 --> 29:08.340
So this is a sample from Charles Brockton Brown's Veland, which was published in 1799, I think.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.702
This is what SGML looks like.

29:09.742 --> 29:17.534
This is part of the bibliographic header where we can record the title of the document, the author, who's responsible for this and that.

29:17.874 --> 29:22.281
And it's just like HTML in that the tags are set off by angle brackets.

29:22.301 --> 29:25.345
This is then just a plain ASCII text file

29:25.898 --> 29:29.624
that has the structure tags embedded in it as ASCII characters.

29:30.625 --> 29:35.132
And then moving down toward the beginning of the document, this is where the text begins.

29:35.192 --> 29:45.568
We give each one of our texts a seven character ID, a unique ID that's composed of the first three letters of the author's last name and the first four letters of the first major word in the title.

29:46.069 --> 29:49.594
And this helps us keep track of our database because we don't have any

29:49.827 --> 29:51.609
We don't have any database software.

29:51.629 --> 29:57.296
We're not using any kind of relational or organizational structure and no software to organize it.

29:57.336 --> 30:00.380
It's just a set of directories with text.

30:00.480 --> 30:10.093
We have front matter here that includes the title page, which is transcribed with different tags, marking the different parts of the title page, which contains an epigraph, for example.

30:12.976 --> 30:17.522
We also have as part of the front matter, here's a page break between the title page and an advertisement.

30:17.722 --> 30:19.364
So this is all SGML, right?

30:19.404 --> 30:24.049
This is all SGML, the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines, that particular subset of SGML.

30:24.069 --> 30:26.992
So where do you actually have the page that you filmed?

30:27.012 --> 30:29.234
Okay.

30:30.616 --> 30:36.422
Well, let me show you then what it would look like filtered from SGML to HTML.

30:36.462 --> 30:38.244
You see this, okay?

30:38.524 --> 30:43.189
And this is a picture of page one.

30:44.148 --> 30:47.333
It's not a perfect shot by any means.

30:47.353 --> 30:47.873
That's right.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.958
Is that like Cornell with a guillotine of books actually?

30:51.358 --> 31:02.815
No, in fact, we were very interested in getting as much of the edge as we could because we're intending these images to be useful to bibliographers, people who wanted to get a sense of the object as a three-dimensional object.

31:03.301 --> 31:07.006
And this is also one of the earliest test shots we did.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.069
We've now perfected it so we can eliminate some of the shadow in here.

31:10.470 --> 31:13.253
We had some lighting problems in the first few months of the project.

31:13.273 --> 31:16.437
We've learned a lot about digital cameras and light bulbs and whatnot.

31:17.198 --> 31:18.520
But I think you get a pretty good sense.

31:18.540 --> 31:19.621
You can see the bleed through.

31:19.641 --> 31:21.403
You can see the creases.

31:24.186 --> 31:28.532
Any sort of foliation and signatures has been maintained.

31:29.974 --> 31:31.215
Let me look at another one, too.

31:31.685 --> 31:41.998
We've got a couple other sample images up here, and it depends what side of the book you're on.

31:42.238 --> 31:53.252
This side of the book, because we're at the beginning, the binding is such that there's not much of a shadow on this side to get a cleaner sense.

31:53.272 --> 31:58.198
Then in terms of the covers and spines, we have been able to use

31:59.292 --> 32:13.106
the high quality shots to build a 3D model of this book, which we don't have any software on this particular computer, but using a standard known as VRML, virtual reality modeling language.

32:13.567 --> 32:21.115
Matthew has done all of this work for us, and he can tell you a lot more about VRML and its potential for humanities text projects.

32:21.135 --> 32:26.380
But we've been able to build basically a little geometric

32:27.524 --> 32:49.465
cube a rectangle cube and then simply map these images on top of it so you get a 3d rendering of the book and i can show you an example of that on a different computer this was done in a flatbed scanner as opposed to the digital camera and you can see that you get pretty good quality and we're trying to get a margin to give people a sense of that's right that's right

32:50.052 --> 32:57.564
So we're hoping to bring into high school classrooms and community colleges a sense of these books as their authors would have known them.

32:57.964 --> 33:01.309
You know, what was it like to have the Scarlet Letter in the 1850s?

33:03.994 --> 33:14.290
And then to sort of take the matter one step further, let me just show you some of the uses to which these electronic text and images have been put.

33:14.931 --> 33:18.456
We have a professor here in the English department, Steve Railton, who has

33:19.111 --> 33:24.579
been building up a tremendous site which investigates Mark Twain in his time.

33:25.340 --> 33:48.814
And what he's done is around a core of five electronic texts and a whole host of resources out of the Barrett collection, posters and flyers and manuscript materials and letters, he is asking questions of who was the man, Sam Clemons, and who was the cultural icon, Mark Twain, and who was he as a writer, and how does his books reflect history and his contemporary moment.

33:49.300 --> 33:54.227
And so we have the full text of five electronic books, and he's making more.

33:54.788 --> 34:00.055
And we have a proposal on the table that would let us transcribe several thousand of Twain's letters.

34:00.997 --> 34:05.042
And say, around the e-text of Huck Finn, you can search Mark Twain's works.

34:05.082 --> 34:06.544
You can view it chapter by chapter.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.450
You can also look at all the sources and pretexts that Railton's identified.

34:11.151 --> 34:14.095
You can look at advertisements and publicity for the book.

34:14.115 --> 34:18.261
You can learn all about subscription sales and how this was

34:18.663 --> 34:25.291
very much a part of the culture and a part of Twain's sense of himself as a writer and the reason why he hurried and whatnot.

34:25.711 --> 34:42.752
You can actually take a tour with seeing what a subscription salesperson would show you if they came to your door, so we built up a little slideshow here with pictures of the sample books that we have downstairs in the Barrett collection.

34:43.252 --> 34:47.978
You can also look at illustration history for the novel.

34:48.228 --> 34:53.174
examples of illustrated copies from 1885 through 1985.

34:54.716 --> 35:01.584
You can compare representations of Jim over the years and investigate how that sort of reflects images of race.

35:03.386 --> 35:09.574
And then he has taken manuscripts of Twain's letters and pictures of Mark Twain.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.358
And so, for example, he can look at with his students

35:13.726 --> 35:19.433
how Mark Twain signed his name, depending on who he was writing to and how he conceived of his own identity.

35:20.935 --> 35:22.817
And these are all manuscripts we have downstairs.

35:23.178 --> 35:25.361
It's wonderful, isn't it?

35:25.461 --> 35:28.885
And again, you click on these little thumbnails and you get a larger version of the JPEG.

35:29.406 --> 35:36.975
Now, we have also spent the summer transcribing and marking up in SGMAIL many of the resources that Steve Railton has pictures of here.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.278
So we're still putting that together in final form.

35:40.152 --> 35:45.560
It gives undergraduates so much more access to these rare materials than they ever could assign.

35:45.600 --> 35:55.634
You know, here at UVA especially, there are 350 students in an American lit survey, and you just cannot tell them to go to special collections and look at these things.

35:55.654 --> 36:00.761
You know, it's entirely unfeasible.

36:02.564 --> 36:07.611
So, let me just quickly pull up this 3D model of the...

36:07.895 --> 36:09.917
for these Unix computers over here.

36:09.938 --> 36:13.001
It's pretty much only for the PC at this point.

36:13.021 --> 36:15.705
And as I say, Matt Kirshenbaum knows a lot more about this.

36:15.725 --> 36:32.125
He can certainly answer any questions we have.

36:32.145 --> 36:37.311
In a particular VRML viewer, it's a plugin that goes with Netscape.

36:37.915 --> 36:41.340
And what's loading now are the images of the covers in this file.

36:43.503 --> 36:49.432
And again, those are in the JPEG format, the compressed image format, the same as we have just the ceiling on the web.

36:49.452 --> 36:53.198
That's the problem.

36:53.218 --> 36:54.700
These things take forever to load.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.200
They do.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.584
And part of it is that our machines aren't that fast.

36:57.604 --> 37:00.428
And what's really not fast is the network speed in this building.

37:00.508 --> 37:04.274
Even though we have a T1 connection to the internet, one stuff comes into Alderman.

37:04.294 --> 37:06.437
It's just such an old wiring system.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.905
This is V-list.

37:17.326 --> 37:19.128
That's right.

37:19.168 --> 37:24.736
So it's really a 3D model where you have sort of the edges down here.

37:26.819 --> 37:28.602
So how was that photographed?

37:28.622 --> 37:30.725
On a blackboard scanner.

37:30.745 --> 37:32.307
All the sides were filmed differently.

37:32.327 --> 37:34.450
So what's making an animated figure?

37:34.565 --> 37:36.667
Programming or something?

37:36.748 --> 37:37.288
The coding.

37:37.348 --> 37:37.528
Right.

37:37.629 --> 37:44.116
VRML is a standard sort of like SGML and HTML, and it's a set of mathematical coordinates.

37:44.136 --> 37:49.302
And so you plot a box that would correspond to the size of the actual book.

37:49.322 --> 37:51.445
You know, we have the measurement of the book in centimeters.

37:51.845 --> 37:55.430
Make a box and then say, on this face of the box, put this JPEG.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.814
On this face of the box, put this other JPEG.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.876
And then this browser,

38:01.160 --> 38:06.184
takes those images and renders them in this three-dimensional virtual reality space.

38:06.204 --> 38:06.968
Can you open the book?

38:07.606 --> 38:08.727
That's our next goal.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.870
We want to be able to say... They're doing that at the British Library, by the way.

38:10.890 --> 38:12.111
It's called Turning the Pages.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.293
We'd love to do that.

38:13.313 --> 38:16.797
They show me page 185 and have the book open up, but we're not quite there yet.

38:16.817 --> 38:20.501
They say the space, the computing, the power that they need.

38:20.582 --> 38:23.525
But they're doing what the Lindisfarne Gospel is called, Turning the Pages.

38:23.605 --> 38:24.686
That's wonderful.

38:24.807 --> 38:25.748
Yeah, I was over there in March.

38:25.768 --> 38:36.921
Well, Katie Thiemann, the center's director, was in Japan in March, and the University of Osaka has an entire room dedicated to VRML, where they have about $300,000 worth of equipment

38:36.901 --> 38:43.127
walls of these 3D modeling machines that just run the most incredible, incredible time.

38:43.208 --> 38:43.908
So they're doing it?

38:43.948 --> 38:45.049
Is this anything I need?

38:45.070 --> 38:45.690
Any of this stuff?

38:45.770 --> 38:49.154
No, these are a lot of the help sheets that we publish.

38:49.174 --> 38:49.895
Okay.

38:50.355 --> 38:51.736
Can I chat with them?

38:51.777 --> 38:52.457
Yes, of course.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.579
These are all available on the web.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.021
You can take one of these.

38:56.121 --> 38:58.704
You can take anything on this stuff.

38:59.485 --> 38:59.785
Sure.

38:59.805 --> 39:03.769
This is, again, our instructions for scanning text with optical character recognition.

39:03.867 --> 39:06.551
We do teach a series of short cases.

39:06.611 --> 39:07.012
No, I don't.

39:07.652 --> 39:10.577
We have two, one for images and one for text, which I believe you have.

39:10.597 --> 39:14.182
Here's an example of a letter by Thomas Jefferson.

39:14.222 --> 39:15.103
Oh, yeah.

39:15.203 --> 39:16.245
I want all this stuff.

39:16.265 --> 39:16.465
Good.

39:17.006 --> 39:20.411
I'm going to allow you to just sort of help you send different software packages that you have.

39:20.631 --> 39:21.212
And what's this?

39:22.214 --> 39:24.036
That is the library newsletter.

39:24.056 --> 39:25.599
Here's the library during this quarter.

39:28.222 --> 39:30.786
I'm going to go take a half hour nap.
