00:01.904 --> 00:05.730
It's nice to read a book about a father.

00:06.050 --> 00:10.377
I just did a PW interview with James Carroll and his book about his father.

00:10.718 --> 00:12.340
Oh, yes, they had some difficulties.

00:12.961 --> 00:18.369
I did an interview for my call this week on Mary Gordon and her book about her father.

00:19.131 --> 00:20.633
Are you familiar with her book?

00:22.215 --> 00:24.279
We have it, and my wife is reading it.

00:24.319 --> 00:25.140
I haven't read it yet.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.844
Of course, she discovers that her father is...

00:28.972 --> 00:35.500
a great deceiver and a phony and anti-Semite and all those other things.

00:36.141 --> 00:43.129
So I have to tell you, it's nice to have a peaceful Father's Day where Dad's a really good guy.

00:44.351 --> 00:46.433
Well, my dad was a good guy.

00:47.655 --> 00:55.905
I mean, it could be that I'm just such a sorry reporter that I'm not understanding that he was doing bootlegging on the side or something, but I don't think so.

00:56.586 --> 00:57.747
I think that he...

00:58.486 --> 00:59.948
He was an admirable character.

01:00.950 --> 01:12.407
It is sort of embarrassing to write about your family when it wasn't really dysfunctional.

01:13.870 --> 01:25.067
I can't... I think I mentioned in the book I never heard my parents raise their voices to each other or even speak harshly to each other.

01:25.604 --> 01:54.042
maybe they did somewhere but not in my hearing so and my dad I think was what he was in a way on the other hand like a lot of Americans of that generation I think of sort of the turn of the century immigrant generation or the children of those people he was more complicated than he seemed on the surface and had a lot of aspects to him that weren't

01:54.832 --> 01:58.197
If you just met him, it would seem just rather quiet.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.505
This actually was a New Yorker piece, I think.

02:03.525 --> 02:03.626
Yeah.

02:04.327 --> 02:17.447
Originally, about a couple of years ago, I guess right around this time, it ran in the New Yorker as a sort of reminiscence.

02:18.423 --> 02:22.930
At the time, I didn't think I knew enough to write a book.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.614
I mean, write just simply enough to write a book.

02:25.654 --> 02:33.386
And then, I don't know, a year or so later, we decided to do it as a book, even though it would be a very small book.

02:33.406 --> 02:36.311
And I thought I would add, I don't know, a thousand words or something.

02:36.351 --> 02:39.236
But as it turned out, I added about 40%.

02:39.396 --> 02:46.607
I think I... Yeah, it's about... It's not twice as long as the New Yorker piece, but it's considerably...

02:46.840 --> 02:50.865
Just kind of curiosity, approximately how many words did you say?

02:51.025 --> 02:57.493
It's probably just under 30,000 words, probably somewhere 28, 30,000, something like that.

03:00.177 --> 03:15.075
I think I probably had a lot of information and memories and thoughts about this in the crevices of my mind that I didn't realize I had.

03:15.967 --> 03:19.791
Actually, every time I got it back, I kept adding more and more.

03:20.712 --> 03:29.142
Well, I like every chapter that has a little, almost even a little phrase, you know, it stands to reason, the act of swearing off a father or a grocer.

03:29.863 --> 03:35.129
You know, you must have just kind of remembered certain shades or certain aspects.

03:35.149 --> 03:35.389
Yeah.

03:35.569 --> 03:36.650
Well, I think that's true.

03:36.771 --> 03:40.675
And also, somebody asked me yesterday how I...

03:41.819 --> 04:10.172
remember things about my father who after all died in 1967 as a young man and but I was talking the other day to somebody who had interviewed me about just a little profile or something for a book magazine or something years ago and he said you know I read the book and I remember some of the stories I mean obviously these some of those stories about my father were sort of

04:11.266 --> 04:29.562
part of my memory before I realized I was going to write about it and so and then recalling them sort of brought up other things but it was mainly that I decided from the beginning that I wasn't going to do the sort of book where you go and

04:31.010 --> 04:32.132
find out what St.

04:32.152 --> 04:36.719
Joe was like in 1922 or something.

04:36.819 --> 04:44.971
Well, I think she did because that was what was interesting about her father.

04:44.991 --> 04:49.378
And I think her father died when she was very young.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.165
Everything was mythic.

04:54.719 --> 05:24.017
and you did have some factual yeah I had I had my dad you know until I grew up and and um so it was uh it was a different situation and also I always knew that um I mean I always did realize that it was hard for me to uh imagine my life without my father I mean without his aspirations without his examples um

05:25.195 --> 05:29.381
I really felt his presence for much longer.

05:29.421 --> 05:45.682
I think also Mary had the situation where her father obviously was, one, maybe not what he appeared to be, and two, what he appeared to be was odd enough.

05:46.544 --> 05:47.505
I mean, she did know.

05:47.525 --> 05:53.633
I mean, as I remember, as I say, I haven't started it yet, but as I remember, it wasn't that he didn't

05:54.271 --> 05:56.695
claimed to have been Jewish from the start.

05:57.477 --> 06:00.883
So she knew he was a Jewish anti-Semite to start with, right?

06:00.923 --> 06:02.165
She knew he was anti-Semitic.

06:02.205 --> 06:05.471
She didn't know that he came, that he was an immigrant.

06:06.032 --> 06:06.313
Right.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.418
She didn't know that his first language was Yiddish.

06:09.979 --> 06:15.790
She didn't know that his name had been Israel, which he changed, or his family changed to David.

06:16.192 --> 06:17.234
He lied about his age.

06:17.274 --> 06:18.436
He said he went to Harvard.

06:18.997 --> 06:22.964
He really didn't construct, fabricate a new identity for himself.

06:22.984 --> 06:31.719
And there are a number of books, not a number, but I mean, obviously it's a different situation.

06:31.739 --> 06:38.250
I mean, it's something like Jeffrey Wolf's book about his father, who...

06:38.703 --> 06:41.487
I don't think Jeffrey Wolf realized his father was Jewish.

06:41.587 --> 06:43.709
Duke of Deception was the title of the book.

06:43.850 --> 06:44.490
Yeah, exactly.

06:44.791 --> 06:52.060
He must have been in college or out of it before he realized that his father had lied about almost everything.

06:54.183 --> 06:59.750
But my father was very strict about lying.

06:59.830 --> 07:07.039
I mean, there wasn't any question of anybody lying about anything and had very strict notions about all that.

07:07.272 --> 07:14.580
Yes, and it would have been, I guess, particularly shocking to me if I, because that was sort of the center of my father's character.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.382
But he had no pretensions, your father.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.463
No, that's right.

07:17.583 --> 07:20.046
He was in his mind's eye, and then you were as well.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.167
He was closer.

07:21.187 --> 07:21.667
That's right.

07:21.748 --> 07:27.173
Even though he was much more substantial than that phrase.

07:27.614 --> 07:35.142
No, but that's what he was, and he didn't have any pretensions, and not only that, he sort of mocked pretensions.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.144
I mean, his phrase...

07:37.580 --> 07:38.521
Big Knocker.

07:39.202 --> 07:59.002
I think once you've really completely digested the phrase from your youth, Big Knocker, it's very hard to look at that and look at pretentious people with anything but a little bit of contempt just from that one phrase.

07:59.623 --> 08:02.406
And he was decidedly Kansas City, too, wasn't he?

08:02.546 --> 08:03.127
Yeah, or St.

08:03.147 --> 08:03.387
Joe.

08:03.447 --> 08:05.409
I'm not sure what.

08:05.689 --> 08:06.490
Yeah, yeah.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.566
He was very Midwestern, yeah.

08:10.986 --> 08:16.996
I mean, it was odd that, you know, when I talk about his humor, that he both collected Yiddish curses.

08:17.337 --> 08:30.337
He liked all sorts of curses, but I think he was basically a specialist in the Yiddish curse of, you know, the sort of may have an itch, boy, it's impossible to scratch sort of curse.

08:30.838 --> 08:31.920
But also...

08:32.407 --> 08:47.386
You know, his favorite joke was that joke I mentioned about the traveling salesman stopping to ask directions of the boy lying under a tree, acting, asking, saying to the boy, if you can show me a lazier act in that, I'll give you a dime.

08:47.406 --> 08:49.028
And the boy says, put it in my pocket.

08:49.448 --> 08:52.211
I mean, it's a totally Midwestern joke.

08:53.093 --> 08:59.140
Or, I mean, he loves sort of Midwestern play dumb, put on sort of humor.

08:59.693 --> 09:03.058
And his favorite writer, of course, was O. Henry Rove.

09:03.098 --> 09:06.743
He loved the sort of flip-ending odd.

09:07.644 --> 09:13.873
Well, you do point out that you live close to—there's a tree that has some sort of O. Henry Rove.

09:13.893 --> 09:13.973
Yes.

09:13.993 --> 09:14.754
Yeah.

09:14.774 --> 09:29.515
Yeah, the tree in our backyard, in fact, in New York, is constantly being explained by tour guides, who also sometimes explain that the same courtyard was the setting for Rear Window.

09:29.647 --> 09:31.890
Even though... I don't think so.

09:32.231 --> 09:32.471
No.

09:32.651 --> 09:35.055
Rear window, in fact, was shot on the lot.

09:35.315 --> 09:39.501
But if it looked like anything, it was maybe Murray Hill or someplace like that.

09:39.521 --> 09:42.786
It didn't look anything like a 19th century courtyard in Greenwich Village.

09:43.307 --> 09:47.033
But a lot of people sort of nod sagely when they say that.

09:47.053 --> 09:54.203
And then they say that the tree was the tree that the last leaf, the O. Henry story.

09:58.638 --> 10:03.943
It's perfect for me for Father's Day, of course, and I'm sure you were mindful and your publisher was mindful of this.

10:04.764 --> 10:10.669
Ah, Forrest Strauss, right out there on the edge of the cutting edge of marketing.

10:10.869 --> 10:27.885
Yeah, I knew stories from about 25 newspapers, and it's a sales job, you know, and I pitch things, and I found a good deal of success pitching things and tying them in, and this year I had three different

10:31.308 --> 10:33.652
And, you know, I moved Mary for this week.

10:33.672 --> 10:34.593
I'm going to save Jim.

10:34.773 --> 10:38.319
I already did him for PW, and then I'll adapt to Pete McComb.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.724
But this is the one I like as a father.

10:42.005 --> 10:44.028
As a father.

10:44.128 --> 10:48.535
Every guy isn't an asshole.

10:48.555 --> 10:49.697
You'll excuse my grief.

10:49.777 --> 10:59.172
Well, no, I think, I mean, it is odd, although, you know, it's in a way the same thing

11:00.113 --> 11:04.698
situation of people asking, why do newspapers print so much bad news?

11:04.738 --> 11:06.340
That's the news.

11:06.480 --> 11:15.890
And that ordinarily, if your father is who he seems, a regular person, goes to work in the morning, so much for that.

11:17.051 --> 11:21.196
And I have to say that I had questions in my mind when I started doing this.

11:26.502 --> 11:29.665
Here I am writing down anecdotes

11:30.337 --> 11:33.160
about a grocer in Kansas City.

11:34.121 --> 11:35.803
Why would anybody be interested in that?

11:36.844 --> 11:58.268
I mean, you know, I think that, you know, eventually if you continue with a book, it means that you're getting to feel, well, maybe it's about something else or maybe it's about, you know, about being a parent or transmitting values or some of those

11:59.834 --> 12:18.942
people in that generation who I think are sort of unappreciated in some ways in the sense that somebody asked, well, what does this have to do with one of your girls to know about things?

12:19.002 --> 12:27.495
Of course, because in the same way that we used to have a very small well

12:27.830 --> 12:30.252
in Nova Scotia where we lived in the summer.

12:31.013 --> 12:41.324
And unlike New York, where you turn on the tap and the water comes out, if it didn't rain sufficiently, we had water problems in Nova Scotia.

12:41.344 --> 12:48.110
And I thought, I mean, they were irritating, but I thought in the long run, that's probably good for the girls.

12:48.751 --> 12:57.600
I mean, that there's actually a connection between things, that things just didn't happen, and that the life that they grew up in in New York

12:58.120 --> 13:11.522
Where, for instance, as an example, most of the people we know are in work that vaguely or specifically, or even gloriously in some cases, pleases them.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.285
I mean, it's what they want to do.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.449
That's why they're there.

13:16.671 --> 13:24.043
My father worked for years in the grocery business, which he hated from the beginning.

13:24.496 --> 13:27.079
almost literally, as I say in the book.

13:27.119 --> 13:29.462
He was a grocer, so I didn't have to be a grocer.

13:29.942 --> 13:33.706
It seems to me good for my girls to see this didn't just happen.

13:34.267 --> 13:37.490
Somebody actually planned this.

13:38.171 --> 13:52.427
He planned for me to be there and planned for me to be able to go to Yale, planned for me to have the sort of opportunities that would allow me to work in the sort of thing that I wanted to work in instead of what I had to work in.

13:52.812 --> 14:04.807
And so in my specific case, and it's usually not as clear as it is in my case because it gets sort of muddied in a number of ways, you know what I mean?

14:06.168 --> 14:12.997
My life is sort of a product of his life, and I'm sure that I wanted my girls to see that.

14:14.659 --> 14:22.448
But it did seem strange thinking, wait a minute, this is not a man of

14:23.626 --> 14:29.735
or there's just not anybody who said he was one thing and did the other.

14:29.796 --> 14:34.803
He was really who he was and without any sort of apologies for anything.

14:35.484 --> 14:38.088
And so why am I doing this?

14:39.891 --> 14:43.557
But then I sort of couldn't stop, and so here it is.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.642
Of course, you're a reporter.

14:46.682 --> 14:52.030
You're a journalist by profession and a distinguished one over many years standing.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.527
This is not a piece of journalism.

14:55.587 --> 14:55.888
No.

14:56.088 --> 14:57.570
This is memory, really.

14:57.690 --> 14:58.892
It's memory, yeah.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.976
And you didn't go out and do any reporting, per se.

15:02.057 --> 15:03.038
Not really, no.

15:04.220 --> 15:11.370
I kind of looked for whatever I had on paper about my father.

15:12.051 --> 15:15.055
It's a different exercise, I guess.

15:15.135 --> 15:17.198
Yeah, it is a completely different exercise.

15:17.999 --> 15:21.865
I mean, that would have been possible, but it seems to me...

15:23.617 --> 15:33.126
that it wasn't the direction that was likely to result in anything very interesting.

15:33.506 --> 15:47.019
I mean, in fact, you know, really researching, say, Kansas City during my father's youth or what the grocery business was like in Kansas City.

15:48.320 --> 15:48.841
I mean, St.

15:48.861 --> 15:52.324
Joe during my father's youth or Kansas City during that.

15:52.844 --> 16:11.976
It didn't seem to me, you know, sometimes there's a danger of making more of something than it is so that you have this, I think I would have been in a position of having this little storyline trying to hold up these long digressions that didn't have a whole lot to do with it.

16:11.996 --> 16:14.801
I'm not going to put it in my piece, but it is interesting.

16:15.101 --> 16:17.966
Mary, for instance, because that is a book I just wrote about it.

16:17.986 --> 16:18.126
Right.

16:19.456 --> 16:24.547
She said when she originally wrote this book, she did 120 pages of her father's writing.

16:25.630 --> 16:26.472
And she included it.

16:26.572 --> 16:31.322
And she said one of the great disappointments were to discover how bad of a writer he was.

16:31.984 --> 16:34.309
And then her editor said, Mary, this is terrible stuff.

16:35.217 --> 16:40.403
Maybe you should talk a little bit about it.

16:40.423 --> 16:46.770
Maybe you should not be indulging yourself with his writing.

16:47.070 --> 16:55.139
There are one or two things that I found almost by accident.

16:57.862 --> 17:02.828
One thing I had when I did the New Yorker version and for some reason didn't

17:03.584 --> 17:33.557
I think because I didn't quite understand what I was doing as well as I later did I had this letter that my father had obviously saved and then my sister had it and my mother's my mother had saved a few envelopes of things that my father had saved and I had a letter that's mentioned late in the book that I had written him when I got a

17:34.516 --> 17:36.880
a chance to go to the New Yorker from time.

17:37.481 --> 18:01.097
I had that letter before, but I somehow, I don't think I saw what it was, that it was really a way for me to try to at least start to explain to my father some stuff I should have explained before, but also that it was a way for me to try to

18:01.634 --> 18:09.425
persuade him that I was acting responsibly and that I was maybe even sensible.

18:10.267 --> 18:31.017
And I think that in that era, I think it's maybe less true now because family responsibilities have changed to some extent, but in that era, I think fathers had, in addition to their other worries about how they raised a son, that when he grew up

18:31.874 --> 18:42.427
It was important to them that he would be sensible enough to take on the responsibilities of being what was then called the head of the household himself.

18:42.568 --> 18:44.790
Well, you didn't even ask how much you were going to get paid.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.494
Oh, and that really shocked the hell out of him.

18:47.514 --> 18:49.476
I mean, that one just staggered him.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.679
My father would go nuts over that one, too.

18:51.699 --> 18:58.708
I mean, the silence on the phone when he asked how much the salary was, and I...

18:59.212 --> 19:02.275
I just knew, oh my God, what have I done?

19:03.296 --> 19:05.358
I hadn't even asked.

19:06.319 --> 19:14.967
I felt the need to explain that, and that in the long run it didn't make any difference that it was going to work out, probably.

19:17.950 --> 19:24.316
Something like that was important for the book, that one document, and there were a couple of others.

19:24.957 --> 19:28.020
It was accidental and had nothing to do with the book,

19:28.270 --> 19:49.349
that this wonderful man in California just totally as an act of kindness found the boat manifest showing my grandfather's arrival and my aunt and my father and my grandmother's arrival two or three years later.

19:50.931 --> 19:55.375
Just because he kind of does that sort of stuff as a hobby, and he wrote me a letter saying...

19:56.941 --> 20:02.489
he realized that it was easy to find because of the Galveston Project.

20:02.509 --> 20:07.196
There were only 10,000 Jews involved in the Galveston Project.

20:07.877 --> 20:18.113
And he said, I remember he said, it's all in one drawer in a number of libraries, all these boats manifest and things.

20:18.353 --> 20:21.818
And he said there was even one on Varick Street.

20:22.253 --> 20:23.695
close to me in the village.

20:23.715 --> 20:27.120
He looked up and he said, looks like it's close to your house where you live.

20:27.841 --> 20:29.423
He's in California.

20:29.443 --> 20:37.275
And then he said, I realized by the time I got through explaining to you how to do this, I could do it myself.

20:37.976 --> 20:39.157
And he sent me all this stuff.

20:39.217 --> 20:42.342
Wasn't that great?

20:42.362 --> 20:46.668
As a reporter, I was just astonished by it.

20:46.688 --> 20:47.790
I just couldn't believe I had it.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.033
There it said their names right there on this

20:50.317 --> 20:55.105
And I had only known the town they came from for about a year.

20:55.125 --> 21:01.035
I mean, I went, what, 50 or 60 years without even knowing where they came from.

21:01.456 --> 21:06.825
And then suddenly he not only told me where they came from, but the name of the boat and everything.

21:07.326 --> 21:07.927
It's just remarkable.

21:07.947 --> 21:10.290
I didn't know that they had that extensive documentation.

21:10.371 --> 21:10.751
Yeah.

21:11.072 --> 21:15.379
And not only that, he sent me the census...

21:16.658 --> 21:17.279
for St.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.741
Joe in 1910 and in 1920.

21:20.041 --> 21:28.629
And in those days, the census listed every person and the person's address and the person's occupation.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.371
And my family was in there in 1910.

21:30.451 --> 21:36.597
They were in there in 1920, showing who they were, what work they did.

21:36.617 --> 21:41.681
There was my uncle, Benny, my favorite great uncle.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.404
And so it was...

21:44.857 --> 21:49.645
A couple of things like that were really nice, but that's a long answer to the question.

21:50.426 --> 21:55.774
I didn't really see this as a sort of repertorial search.

21:55.794 --> 21:59.560
You weren't documenting him.

21:59.620 --> 22:09.075
What I was trying to do was to write partly about his effect on me, which...

22:09.899 --> 22:26.295
And I think one of the differences between me and my father and other people and their fathers, although some people may have the same situation, it was very clear in my case that my father sort of planned me.

22:27.155 --> 22:37.825
I mean, he had some very specific notion about what was going to happen to his son, including where he was going to go to college.

22:38.286 --> 22:39.467
But not the problem so much.

22:39.802 --> 22:42.128
No, although I think that was in the air.

22:42.428 --> 22:51.050
I mean, as I say in the book, I kind of look back for signs, and I maybe look a little too hard, because I want to believe I'm doing something that would have pleased him.

22:51.431 --> 22:56.303
And he seemed pleased when I started it.

22:57.044 --> 22:57.726
And he was...

22:58.482 --> 23:00.765
still alive when I went to the New Yorker, of course.

23:00.785 --> 23:02.788
I love the fact that they had to go subscribe to it.

23:02.808 --> 23:04.531
I mean, you probably didn't know that much about it.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.412
No, no.

23:05.512 --> 23:08.617
He was not a, um... Time they knew.

23:08.637 --> 23:24.039
So, yeah, they knew time, and time was, you know, and, and, um, I seemed to be doing all right, and I, um, at one point, time did one of those publisher's letters during, I think it was during the Freedom Ride, when I was in the bus station in the Freedom Ride.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.401
And, um,

23:26.258 --> 23:27.019
They liked that.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.562
There's my picture in there.

23:30.586 --> 23:38.701
So, yeah, they were, my father was a little wary about the move to New York.

23:38.721 --> 23:42.167
I mean, particularly when I told him I had no idea what I was going to be paid.

23:42.308 --> 23:45.994
You at one point, I think, said that you expected to go back to Kansas City.

23:46.555 --> 23:46.856
Yes.

23:46.956 --> 23:49.060
To be interviewed, hailed as the, uh.

23:49.512 --> 23:53.476
Yes, exactly.

23:54.137 --> 24:09.253
I don't think I had thought about it much, but I think I mentioned in a book that I remember when there was an option of learning how to play squash, and I said, why would I do that?

24:09.294 --> 24:11.055
There aren't any squash courts in Kansas City.

24:11.456 --> 24:14.139
Am I going to go 235 miles to St.

24:14.199 --> 24:16.161
Louis to play squash?

24:16.715 --> 24:28.609
I was talking about that in Omaha recently with a Yale alumnus from an old family in Omaha.

24:28.629 --> 24:35.818
And he said, oh, yes, the University Club, or the Kansas City Club, I can't remember what he said, had squash courts.

24:35.838 --> 24:38.761
And I said, not for us.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.603
No, it didn't.

24:40.623 --> 24:41.064
I'm sorry.

24:41.084 --> 24:43.587
That was not quite within our frame of reference.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.568
I didn't know about it.

24:44.588 --> 24:46.350
How do you suppose you fixed on Yale?

24:46.904 --> 24:47.725
Oh, I know.

24:47.925 --> 24:48.606
It was Stover.

24:49.186 --> 24:51.588
I mean, he read this book, Stover at Yale.

24:52.429 --> 24:56.112
I quoted some of the book in Remembering Denny.

24:56.253 --> 25:00.797
I had never actually read it, even though it obviously was a great deflection on my life.

25:01.497 --> 25:07.082
But my wife actually asked him, because she didn't believe me that that's why I'd gone to Yale.

25:07.863 --> 25:10.666
And he said, oh, I read this book.

25:11.286 --> 25:15.510
And he had...

25:15.727 --> 25:18.049
He had read it, I assume, as a child.

25:18.469 --> 25:26.196
It came out in 1911, and my father was born in 1905, so he read it when he was a 15-year-old or something, maybe.

25:26.977 --> 25:33.343
I'm sorry, he was born in 1906, so he read it pretty, you know, it was almost contemporary when he read it.

25:34.124 --> 25:35.945
And it was really odd.

25:35.965 --> 25:45.514
I mean, the writing in it sounds like kind of an English schoolboy novel, you know, people being called chaps and stuff like that.

25:46.237 --> 25:48.240
And Goodfellow.

25:50.343 --> 25:56.733
I mean, there he was reading it in a house where English probably wasn't even spoken.

25:56.753 --> 25:57.655
This is very odd.

25:59.097 --> 26:01.000
But he had fixed on that.

26:01.821 --> 26:14.961
As I said, he was temporarily very impressed by Princeton at the college night in my high school because the guy at the Princeton booth

26:15.363 --> 26:20.631
said that Princeton did not allow undergraduates to have automobiles.

26:21.732 --> 26:25.938
And an absolute prohibition was really the way to my father's heart.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.560
I mean, he loved that idea.

26:28.321 --> 26:29.663
No automobiles.

26:29.723 --> 26:33.669
Was he mindful that these Ivy League schools had quotas against Jewish students?

26:34.190 --> 26:43.463
Well, he asked at this one night, this one moment of panic that he had before I went to Yale,

26:44.675 --> 26:50.681
our probably fourth trip to the college night at Southwest High School.

26:50.701 --> 27:02.534
And this rather patrician Yale representative was just an alumnus who was volunteering for that.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.715
But they still do it.

27:03.975 --> 27:04.716
Yeah.

27:04.756 --> 27:14.226
From an old, I think, Kansas City, probably stockyard or agriculture business family.

27:14.881 --> 27:24.953
My father had two questions that really astounded me.

27:25.633 --> 27:42.913
One of them was whether Yale had some course in accounting, because he wouldn't want me to come out totally ignorant of just rudimentary bookkeeping.

27:43.417 --> 27:47.901
And what astounded me about that is not the connection between Yale and accounting.

27:48.001 --> 27:49.842
I didn't know anything about Yale as far as I knew.

27:49.943 --> 27:52.865
They taught shorthand.

27:52.885 --> 27:54.386
I didn't know anything about it.

27:56.368 --> 28:04.615
But I thought that he assumed that I was sort of above this sort of thing, that I was going to be something other than a business person.

28:04.675 --> 28:08.699
I wouldn't have to worry about that.

28:08.959 --> 28:12.782
And almost...

28:13.252 --> 28:23.845
what's called in Yiddish a yeshiva bracha, a guy who just is a scholar or something.

28:23.885 --> 28:25.807
He doesn't worry about practical things.

28:26.288 --> 28:39.483
But I think that accounting question has to do with the American father's concern that his son be sensible and be able to support his family.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.567
Have some skills to fall back on.

28:42.935 --> 28:56.594
And then the other thing he asked was whether Yale had some sort of quota that would keep me, that might keep me out even if I qualified in other ways.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.238
They never admitted to the quota.

28:59.258 --> 29:09.212
No, and in fact that surprised me a lot too because he simply never talked about that sort of thing.

29:09.614 --> 29:16.080
I was not raised at all with the thought that there was any restriction on what I could do.

29:16.821 --> 29:18.583
And he didn't.

29:18.603 --> 29:22.467
My father, I think, ordinarily would have considered that sort of thing fetching.

29:23.188 --> 29:25.750
You know, he said, just go, you know, do what you're supposed to do.

29:25.850 --> 29:29.434
He was a fairly assimilated American.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.637
Yeah, I mean, in his views, he was very similar.

29:32.977 --> 29:39.063
And he never, never talked about, oh, isn't it a shame that you can't do this.

29:39.184 --> 29:39.604
I mean,

29:39.753 --> 29:44.721
We were, I mean, there wasn't anything that... That just wasn't part of the discourse?

29:44.741 --> 29:45.803
It wasn't part of the discourse.

29:45.843 --> 29:52.193
I mean, I suppose that we lived in a place where we couldn't have joined the Kansas City Country Club.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.158
I mean, it was so far from our lives.

29:55.238 --> 29:57.542
I mean, you know, it didn't occur.

29:57.943 --> 30:01.088
And the guy said none that he knew about.

30:01.108 --> 30:05.355
And, of course, one of the odd things is that this was...

30:06.213 --> 30:10.437
The year I got out of high school, so this was 52 or 53.

30:10.457 --> 30:12.139
I got out of high school in 53.

30:13.039 --> 30:20.406
And it was actually a period when I think most people assumed that the quota business was over.

30:21.027 --> 30:35.781
But in fact, in about 62 or 63, after I left Yale, some people at Yale, led by I think the Hillel rabbi, had done a study

30:36.082 --> 30:49.998
over the years and had come up with what they suspected, which was a suspiciously consistent number of Jews in each incoming class.

30:50.098 --> 31:02.151
And, of course, what was going on, whether it was university policy or not, but these old boys in the admissions office were probably in a sub-roser way.

31:02.251 --> 31:02.832
I mean, they weren't

31:03.048 --> 31:29.325
keeping out jews and at all you know they but they were they were letting in they were maintaining a balance they probably would have said if you got them into a corner so so he wasn't that wrong about it i mean it was going on um if you say through the very end that the

31:29.693 --> 31:33.539
coded messages to your children.

31:35.261 --> 31:49.823
And I think maybe that's what it is.

31:49.843 --> 31:50.804
Right.

31:50.864 --> 31:53.288
Well, at least.

31:53.308 --> 31:55.611
.

31:56.152 --> 31:56.933
Some of the messages I

32:01.368 --> 32:08.179
But I know that I didn't want it to be as different from my upbringing as it seemed to be in the surface.

32:08.199 --> 32:15.611
So I guess what you're saying is a lot of what you got from your father was by implication and by influence.

32:15.731 --> 32:15.991
Yes.

32:16.833 --> 32:29.012
And I also thought that it was that when I think about my father in terms of sort of what happens today in various ways, I think my father had what

32:29.161 --> 32:34.046
what are, I'm sure, considered extremely square notions about most things.

32:35.948 --> 32:44.598
But I realize, and my wife was raised in somewhat similar circumstances.

32:44.638 --> 32:59.033
She was the only child, so she was treated not as the girl who was going to stay home, but, you know, and her father, her mother was Jewish and her father was a

32:59.553 --> 33:04.599
He had really come from a farm in North Carolina and run away from home.

33:05.941 --> 33:10.326
So he was almost as much of an immigrant as my father was, I mean, in New York.

33:10.927 --> 33:23.482
But we both realized we had been raised in very square circumstances and also that we really valued having been raised in very square circumstances.

33:23.742 --> 33:27.467
And I think what I was saying there is that superficially...

33:28.105 --> 33:48.064
as I mentioned, in the sense of the sort of people they know, the sort of place they live, the level of education that's assumed from everybody around them, to some extent the opportunities they sort of take for granted rather than are considered unusual that my father wanted from me.

33:48.904 --> 33:57.252
I suppose that I wanted the theme of their upbringing to some extent to be

33:58.683 --> 34:06.671
despite all evidence to the contrary, you're being raised in Kansas City.

34:07.372 --> 34:14.559
This is really like a little outpost of Kansas City here, and you don't see the walls around it, but they're there.

34:15.439 --> 34:17.662
And you have dedicated the book to your daughters.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.704
They never knew their grandfather.

34:20.004 --> 34:20.424
Right.

34:20.444 --> 34:27.171
And so this certainly does enable you to give them...

34:27.353 --> 34:35.340
Yeah, I mean, I hope that this gives them some, you know, they knew some stories, I guess, but not really.

34:35.380 --> 34:42.746
I mean, you know if you have kids, you don't sit there and say, all right, now we're going to tell you about your mom.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.768
I mean, it just doesn't work out that way.

34:44.888 --> 34:56.618
And I certainly didn't think I was starting the book for that reason, but as I finished it, I realized that

34:57.172 --> 35:00.856
that I did want them to have something in one place.

35:00.936 --> 35:05.341
I'm so pleased with my daughter.

35:05.361 --> 35:05.862
I have two daughters.

35:05.882 --> 35:07.864
They're 15 and 13.

35:07.884 --> 35:11.669
My parents are alive, and I never knew any of my grandparents.

35:11.689 --> 35:12.950
That's something you miss.

35:13.271 --> 35:16.014
Oh, it's wonderful to have two grandparents.

35:16.454 --> 35:18.637
My mother was a really good grandmother.

35:22.061 --> 35:26.706
But the other thing that's valuable for kids, I think, is

35:27.783 --> 35:37.034
is just knowing that there are people out there who are really blood beyond just their immediate family.

35:37.194 --> 35:42.861
And my wife, for complicated reasons, basically doesn't have any family.

35:43.382 --> 35:54.735
I mean, her parents are dead, and her father never went back to North Carolina, so that whole side is unknown to her.

35:55.238 --> 36:02.827
and her mother had a small warring family that literally just didn't end up, you know, with any.

36:03.328 --> 36:19.407
So, and I, my family was basically in Kansas City, and I think we were quite conscious of, not just because my mother was there, we wanted her to be able to spend some time with the kids, she sometimes came to New York, but

36:19.724 --> 36:27.251
But also, and I had my sisters in Kansas City, cousins and nephews.

36:27.792 --> 36:38.442
And it was also very nice to be able to drop them off in Kansas City, there's no question about that, and then feel that they were absolutely safe and taken care of by their own family.

36:38.482 --> 36:48.432
But I also was very conscious of wanting them to know that they had a family, that they had people who were actually

36:49.424 --> 37:13.103
responsible for them um you know the Navajos actually have have specific uh roles for all of these people to play I mean an uncle a maternal uncle is responsible in a way that and I think it's among other things in the Navajos that it's really a great idea

37:13.876 --> 37:15.739
You're how old now yourself?

37:15.819 --> 37:16.360
I'm 60.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.782
So you're about the age.

37:17.822 --> 37:20.145
I'm about the age when my father died, yeah.

37:20.346 --> 37:25.433
And of course, when he died, you probably thought he was very old, right?

37:25.453 --> 37:25.874
I did.

37:26.395 --> 37:28.758
Well, I didn't think he was very old.

37:29.279 --> 37:29.820
He was old.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.384
I mean, because my mother's father was still alive.

37:32.905 --> 37:34.467
He lived with them by then.

37:34.987 --> 37:40.032
Uh, so he was still someone who had an older, you know, the next generation.

37:40.672 --> 37:43.855
But of course, yeah, I thought my father was sort of old.

37:44.896 --> 37:57.348
And the other thing is that my father had, because of his health, sort of retreated from business to a certain extent so that he wasn't doing a whole lot when he was my age.

37:57.368 --> 38:02.613
I mean, he was, he was technically working in real estate, but he was home a lot.

38:02.974 --> 38:04.555
And, um,

38:04.872 --> 38:09.778
And he was doing a lot of fishing and things.

38:09.859 --> 38:12.983
And so he seemed sort of retired.

38:16.688 --> 38:19.652
But certainly perspectives do change, yes.

38:21.334 --> 38:27.081
When I think in those days that he was my age, yeah.

38:27.101 --> 38:32.128
I feel fine today.

38:35.483 --> 38:43.044
We always try, I know my father's biggest, his father, my father's father died, he was, you know, 60.

38:43.064 --> 38:43.224
Right.

38:43.264 --> 38:47.215
And I know, my father's big, he's 25.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.667
I mean, his, the big achievement for him was to pass.

38:51.687 --> 38:53.250
Pass, get over that little hump, yeah.

38:53.310 --> 38:53.871
Get over that little hump.

38:53.891 --> 38:57.257
I'm from a family that... And he had tremendous anxiety about that, really.

38:57.297 --> 38:58.118
It was very real.

38:58.378 --> 39:06.292
But in fact, I mean, statistically, if he gets by that hump, and I think the next few years, then... He'd go forever.

39:06.312 --> 39:07.033
He'd go forever.

39:07.053 --> 39:07.855
He'd go forever.

39:07.895 --> 39:11.701
He's deaf as a stone, but other than that, he's... Well, that's great.

39:11.721 --> 39:12.763
He's still healthy, those things.

39:13.081 --> 39:17.747
And he gets around, but yeah, well, that's what counts.

39:18.488 --> 39:22.173
That's when my Uncle Benny had his 90th birthday party in St.

39:22.193 --> 39:22.854
Joe.

39:23.134 --> 39:24.916
I went back for it because I really liked him.

39:25.857 --> 39:32.486
And his son, my cousin, has said, well, Pop's a real pain in the neck.

39:32.546 --> 39:34.168
This was the beginning of his speech.

39:34.929 --> 39:38.253
But he's got his marvels.

39:38.414 --> 39:39.595
He said, well, if you'd

39:39.743 --> 39:42.266
When you lose your marbles, you're far fallen.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.608
When you get it, you're gone.

39:44.628 --> 39:48.833
I've been interviewing some people, as it happens, for this new book that I'm writing.

39:49.293 --> 39:51.896
People just happen to be in their 80s and 90s.

39:52.076 --> 39:55.800
And if they've got it, it's... Oh, absolutely.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.463
Is Otto Bettman from the Bettman Archive?

39:58.643 --> 39:59.364
He's still alive?

39:59.764 --> 40:00.725
No, no, is he alive?

40:00.745 --> 40:02.587
I went to Florida.

40:02.607 --> 40:06.291
I've heard times have a big story of the Bettman Archive being sold to Bill Gates.

40:07.283 --> 40:10.727
And they had a little telephone interview, and I said, geez.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.671
For various reasons, I really wanted to go see him.

40:15.412 --> 40:18.336
And I wound up spending two days with the guy.

40:18.736 --> 40:20.859
He's touched every decade of the century.

40:20.879 --> 40:23.642
And when they have it, the wisdom that just accrues.

40:23.662 --> 40:24.343
Oh, yeah.

40:24.443 --> 40:26.465
It's synergistic.

40:26.565 --> 40:27.927
It's amazing how it just keeps growing.

40:30.890 --> 40:35.215
And it is true that there are some people...

40:35.954 --> 40:38.117
who are in their 90s.

40:38.898 --> 40:47.972
And like Al Hirschfield, 90, 91, whatever he is, seems just the same as he was.

40:47.992 --> 40:48.974
I know it.

40:48.994 --> 40:51.758
There's a guy I interviewed a couple of years ago.

40:51.778 --> 40:53.000
He just died about two years ago.

40:53.020 --> 40:54.342
His name was Dave Kirschenbaum.

40:54.362 --> 40:56.044
He was a big New York book singer.

40:56.064 --> 41:01.152
And he died at the age of 99, a week after they had a party for him and sheltered these.

41:01.469 --> 41:06.936
And, boy, he could tell you stories that were wonderful, you know, wonderful, wonderful stories.

41:07.437 --> 41:24.058
We had a guy in our town in Nova Scotia who was the only sort of, at least in the modern era, our town used to be bigger in the wooden boat era, but it was just a couple hundred people around.

41:24.118 --> 41:29.805
And the only real success story of the town was this man, Joe Letson, who

41:31.220 --> 41:43.016
became a surveyor and then left and somehow became, which is where I became, I think, probably a president of one of the subsidiaries of a big oil company or something.

41:43.036 --> 41:47.462
Came back to retire, bought the parsonage, and came back.

41:47.502 --> 41:49.024
And when he was 65, retired.

41:49.084 --> 41:50.986
It was 1940-something.

41:51.146 --> 41:54.190
And so he was still around a couple years ago.

41:54.231 --> 41:56.113
He was in his late 90s,

41:56.566 --> 42:24.717
wonderful guy great memory could tell you very specific things about the town about which boat was there and came from a long-lived family and had a cousin from Milton down the road who they said was visiting once he was 104 and blind but otherwise okay and he was sitting on a chair like this and Joe was right over there and he said

42:26.232 --> 42:27.674
Whatever happened to little Joe?

42:27.694 --> 42:28.776
Is he still alive?

42:30.098 --> 42:31.801
I mean, just in 98, 99.

42:31.941 --> 42:39.493
Yeah, well, they get to a certain age, and, you know, the survivors, I mean, all my father's friends are dead now.

42:39.513 --> 42:39.633
Right.

42:39.653 --> 42:41.116
And it is kind of distressing.

42:41.236 --> 42:41.556
Right.

42:41.797 --> 42:44.982
They ask, well, we have house owners, oh, dead, dead, dead, dead.

42:45.002 --> 42:46.044
That's right.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.609
You know, we haven't gone into your other, I mean, this is your 19th book.

42:49.810 --> 42:50.771
Yeah, yeah.

42:50.851 --> 42:53.115
And I know I'm familiar with your career.

42:53.135 --> 42:53.235
Yeah.

42:54.076 --> 42:55.998
What are you doing now?

42:56.018 --> 43:04.629
Well, I'm still doing New Yorker pieces, and I do a column now for Time every week.

43:04.669 --> 43:13.159
The column that I used to syndicate to newspapers, and before that was in The Nation, is now in Time.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.164
In fact, I just had a triumph this morning.

43:17.304 --> 43:18.665
Not so much in what I wrote.

43:18.765 --> 43:19.647
That's not important.

43:20.167 --> 43:23.391
But I sent it in on American Online...

43:23.607 --> 43:30.554
Did you save it as an ASCII-2 and then send it as an attachment?

43:30.654 --> 43:31.295
Is that how you did it?

43:32.557 --> 43:34.719
You know what?

43:34.739 --> 43:36.180
I don't even understand that.

43:36.341 --> 43:39.764
I know the phrase, but I'm not quite sure what it means.

43:39.984 --> 43:41.206
I follow my instructions.

43:41.346 --> 43:43.708
Did you write it, say, in WordPerfect or something like that?

43:43.808 --> 43:44.049
Yeah.

43:44.149 --> 43:48.113
And then you sent it over as a WordPerfect text?

43:48.599 --> 43:51.702
Yeah, I put some gobbledygook in front.

43:51.802 --> 43:58.108
I syndicate myself, and I have to go through this stuff, and I send a 25-second transmission.

43:58.328 --> 44:01.230
It's a kind of different way of doing it.

44:01.751 --> 44:02.111
Oh, yeah.

44:02.532 --> 44:09.918
I put this sort of code here, and this code back, and then I had to, and then I sent it as a regular letter.

44:11.700 --> 44:17.425
But I've been doing it, I started the time column in February, and I used to file on a modem from

44:17.877 --> 44:20.860
one of the newspapers, and I just pressed a couple about the same thing.

44:21.341 --> 44:33.253
Modem's a lot easier, but, and the, um, um, but this, uh, but this one, um, they, for some reason, they prefer AOL, and I've been doing it from home all right.

44:33.634 --> 44:41.161
Yeah, and it's, it's, um, uh, but to do it on the road, uh, You did it from a cell phone?

44:41.422 --> 44:42.643
I did it, no, from right there.

44:42.663 --> 44:47.428
I plugged right in, right there, and I was very proud of myself, and I,

44:47.763 --> 44:54.771
We have a friend staying with us from Louisiana, from New Iberia.

44:55.232 --> 44:57.034
The third world, he calls.

44:57.995 --> 45:00.518
And we call him our third world computer maven.

45:00.658 --> 45:02.780
And he happens to be staying at our house this weekend.

45:02.821 --> 45:09.368
I called this morning and said, what I want to tell you to my wife, I do not need to speak to James.

45:09.388 --> 45:11.491
There'll be no need for a conversation with James.

45:11.551 --> 45:14.394
I send it in, not without some problems, but I send it in.

45:15.175 --> 45:16.116
So I'm doing that.

45:16.450 --> 45:20.814
I'm still doing a poem every week for the nation.

45:23.296 --> 45:25.458
I can't possibly explain why.

45:25.838 --> 45:26.759
Deadline Poet.

45:26.839 --> 45:29.021
Deadline Poet was a book about that.

45:29.041 --> 45:33.205
And I thought, oh, I read a book about this.

45:33.285 --> 45:40.791
Maybe this would be a good time to stop and do without that hundred dollars.

45:40.951 --> 45:42.933
Is that what it is?

45:42.953 --> 45:46.356
Yeah, I still got a hundred dollars.

45:46.859 --> 45:50.202
So I wish I could stop, but I can't.

45:50.663 --> 45:53.926
And then I kind of go along for a while, and I think, why am I doing this?

45:54.326 --> 45:59.010
And then a few weeks ago, I did one on one final lot.

45:59.131 --> 46:05.777
It was about the Jacqueline Onassis thing, which was about John John's potty.

46:06.858 --> 46:08.159
What did it go for?

46:08.179 --> 46:10.982
Well, I just made it up.

46:11.002 --> 46:12.683
I would have believed that it was right.

46:12.703 --> 46:14.605
It was pretty close.

46:14.990 --> 46:20.996
That's funny in itself, isn't it?

46:21.097 --> 46:22.298
That's right.

46:22.318 --> 46:25.381
It wasn't that far from reality.

46:25.541 --> 46:27.784
I go to auctions.

46:28.024 --> 46:44.862
That's what I used to call the hairy golden rule, which is that anybody who tries to write satirically about the events of the day has trouble making up something that won't come true while his piece is on the presses.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.504
You wrote a piece for the New Yorker some years ago about Johnny Jenkins?

46:48.965 --> 46:49.225
Yes.

46:50.507 --> 46:52.249
The book guy.

46:53.130 --> 46:55.714
Yeah, yeah.

46:55.774 --> 46:59.359
Sometimes on those things, you know, there's another plateau.

46:59.539 --> 47:02.703
Now, did you think he shot himself or not?

47:03.965 --> 47:04.185
Yes.

47:04.406 --> 47:04.766
You did?

47:05.026 --> 47:05.527
Yeah.

47:05.547 --> 47:07.950
And it was a very clever suicide thing.

47:07.990 --> 47:08.972
Yeah, that's what I thought.

47:09.793 --> 47:15.220
But on the other hand... That's the Golan theory, but it's a pretty goddamn, pardon me, good way to...

47:15.352 --> 47:16.013
Oh, yeah.

47:16.033 --> 47:16.393
To do it.

47:16.794 --> 47:17.915
Oh, yeah.

47:20.919 --> 47:22.581
I found him a very interesting character.

47:22.662 --> 47:24.584
I didn't actually know him before.

47:25.045 --> 47:26.306
That's a good story.

47:26.326 --> 47:28.790
Yeah, he... He did a superior job on it.

47:28.810 --> 47:29.410
Well, thank you.

47:29.430 --> 47:29.611
True.

47:29.851 --> 47:34.016
You know, sometimes there... I don't even mention him in my book because it's done.

47:34.036 --> 47:40.625
Well, sometimes there's stories like that that, you know, you happen to catch on one plateau and then something happened.

47:40.645 --> 47:42.928
You know, I did a piece for The New Yorker on...

47:43.499 --> 47:51.651
the argument over who wrote the song Why Do Fools Fall in Love?

47:52.532 --> 47:56.237
Teenagers.

47:57.219 --> 48:00.243
And Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

48:01.044 --> 48:13.202
And it was really between, I mean, and when I wrote the piece, on one side was this truly evil man named Morris Levy who had

48:13.773 --> 48:27.047
who was actually listed as the writer who had never written anything in his life, not just the owner of the copyright, but the writer of this song, and collecting royalties all these years.

48:27.768 --> 48:36.077
And on the other side was Frankie Lyman's widow, a schoolteacher in Augusta, Georgia.

48:37.238 --> 48:41.282
And Levy, or maybe it was Levy, I can't remember, had...

48:41.802 --> 48:45.809
had done everything to keep her from her, including finding other widows.

48:46.209 --> 49:00.433
Lyman was no saint, and he had a kind of a rival widow and what her lawyer called Levy's bullpen widow, a third one, in case the rival one didn't work out.

49:00.453 --> 49:07.725
And sort of off on the side were the other teenagers, two surviving teenagers, who it was assumed

49:08.448 --> 49:11.752
when she finally won, she would settle with in some way.

49:12.193 --> 49:14.295
And that's when I did my story.

49:14.596 --> 49:26.370
Well, a year or two later, in fact, another court found the surviving teenagers had written.

49:27.332 --> 49:28.934
I don't know who wrote the song.

49:28.994 --> 49:29.835
Probably none of them.

49:29.915 --> 49:37.324
But, you know, the story had sort of... Yeah, the story had sort of moved into a different... And if you would approach it at that...

49:37.861 --> 49:39.843
you would have been a different story.

49:41.205 --> 49:44.208
But I don't think much moved on the Johnny Jenkins story.

49:44.308 --> 49:46.050
I think that it just was what it was.

49:46.091 --> 49:49.074
Oh, I'll have to read that book.

49:49.094 --> 49:51.357
That's an interesting subject, Bibliomania.

49:51.517 --> 50:02.890
I did a piece once on Larry McMurtry going to the Vassar book sale.

50:03.241 --> 50:05.104
Do you know when you did that?

50:05.124 --> 50:07.568
I should have known about that.

50:07.808 --> 50:09.210
I'll try to get Larry in my book.

50:09.230 --> 50:10.612
He didn't want to be interviewed.

50:10.653 --> 50:17.123
I'll send it to you if you give me a card or something.

50:17.183 --> 50:22.371
It's only a 3,000-word piece in the series I used to do around the country for The New Yorker.

50:24.754 --> 50:27.679
The Vassar people used to have these

50:28.233 --> 50:29.720
huge book sales.

50:29.881 --> 50:31.389
They may still... They all know.

50:31.429 --> 50:32.273
They're Prime Hunters.

50:32.293 --> 50:32.474
Yeah.

50:32.494 --> 50:36.052
Brandeis has an... They all have them.

50:36.072 --> 50:36.172
Yeah.

50:36.192 --> 50:36.353
But...
