00:01.938 --> 00:08.070
The obvious response is 296 pages above.

00:08.411 --> 00:15.745
I'm looking for a feature that... The next thing is, the next question you get from stupid interviewers is, no, I mean, what's the story?

00:16.028 --> 00:22.454
If it took me 296 pages to tell it in the book, in print, over 100,000 words, well over.

00:23.736 --> 00:30.142
How do you think I'm going to tell it to you in a paragraph?

00:30.242 --> 00:34.146
No, my job is to come up with something.

00:34.586 --> 00:34.846
Exactly.

00:35.147 --> 00:37.309
And the tour for me is a waste of time.

00:37.409 --> 00:42.694
The only time I go to a sign in one of those circuses in the bookstores,

00:43.265 --> 00:54.552
I don't care if the guy signs the book.

00:54.572 --> 00:55.755
I want to know if the book's any good.

00:55.955 --> 00:58.719
I'm going to buy it.

00:58.739 --> 01:07.572
If by some chance I, by some free arrangement, expect to encounter them, I'll probably bring the book along and then sign it.

01:07.592 --> 01:09.755
Because I do like that.

01:09.775 --> 01:11.297
But if I don't, it won't bother me.

01:11.317 --> 01:13.380
I may drop them a line and say, nice book.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.486
And if it isn't a nice book, I'll keep my mouth shut.

01:17.506 --> 01:20.490
They persist in setting me up for these things.

01:20.971 --> 01:22.393
And they did it in 1992.

01:23.595 --> 01:25.017
And I said after that,

01:25.233 --> 01:33.304
disaster, which would have been greater had I not canceled the West Coast and the Middle West.

01:34.366 --> 01:40.855
I'm not going to do this anymore.

01:40.875 --> 01:41.636
It doesn't work.

01:42.096 --> 01:43.138
Yes, it does not work.

01:43.238 --> 01:45.341
It does not improve the sales of my books.

01:45.902 --> 01:49.086
And it costs a lot of money.

01:49.106 --> 01:49.907
And the crowning

01:50.815 --> 01:51.536
Insult.

01:53.459 --> 01:57.824
It wastes my time.

01:57.844 --> 01:59.887
It prevents me from writing.

01:59.907 --> 02:09.600
When I am in a motel in Charlotte, North Carolina, with nothing to do the whole damn day, I can't write, and don't tell me to get a laptop.

02:10.541 --> 02:11.102
Do you have one?

02:11.323 --> 02:13.005
No, I don't.

02:13.025 --> 02:14.246
I write in my study.

02:14.327 --> 02:18.332
I have to have my surroundings and my reference books and all the rest of it around me.

02:18.352 --> 02:19.894
I've done a lot of effort.

02:20.296 --> 02:21.620
to establish this pest.

02:21.701 --> 02:24.048
And that is where I work.

02:24.169 --> 02:25.935
I don't work on air flying.

02:26.818 --> 02:29.647
And neither does anybody else follow or ask.

02:29.808 --> 02:33.580
Or motel rooms or anything.

02:34.640 --> 02:42.313
A man I know said to me, I told him about changing computers, he said, you should have gotten the power button right on your boat.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.637
I said, why the hell do you think I have the boat?

02:44.657 --> 02:46.921
To get away from the writing.

02:46.941 --> 02:47.782
So I won't work.

02:48.383 --> 02:54.994
And the reason I have the boat instead of something else is because sailing is the only thing I like to do so well when I'll do it instead of writing.

02:55.143 --> 02:59.930
And it will take your mind to that brief moment away from Brighton.

03:01.132 --> 03:03.595
Oh, it's more than a brief moment.

03:03.615 --> 03:03.936
Or whatever.

03:03.956 --> 03:06.279
We went to Buzzards Bay and Narragansk Bay this summer.

03:06.299 --> 03:07.822
We had a glorious time.

03:07.842 --> 03:11.006
We put about 320 miles in that vessel.

03:11.026 --> 03:12.208
It was just great.

03:12.468 --> 03:14.572
It was wonderful.

03:16.454 --> 03:19.699
And the thing about sailing is the thing.

03:19.983 --> 03:24.388
I can't stand something in which you're not thinking.

03:24.408 --> 03:27.351
Boring, whatever it is.

03:27.371 --> 03:29.994
I don't want to watch the grass grow.

03:30.014 --> 03:31.656
I don't want to watch somebody else sail.

03:33.098 --> 03:39.044
I'm sailing.

03:39.405 --> 03:40.526
That's true.

03:40.546 --> 03:41.587
How do you like hope?

03:43.009 --> 03:45.431
Jack McCray is the best editor I've ever had.

03:45.451 --> 03:46.092
Far or none.

03:46.561 --> 04:00.906
Jack knows when he reads my manuscript, when I finally let him see it, when I finally coyly show him a bit of a thing, he knows exactly what's wrong with it.

04:00.926 --> 04:03.090
And he knows exactly how to fix it.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.975
And he's half right.

04:06.816 --> 04:08.740
He knows what's wrong with it.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.122
He has no idea how to fix it.

04:10.304 --> 04:13.647
And once he tells me what's wrong with it, you fix it.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.429
I know how to fix it.

04:15.449 --> 04:19.793
But do you have a sense maybe that you know what's wrong with it and he's just validating it?

04:19.813 --> 04:20.133
No, I don't.

04:20.353 --> 04:21.254
He's validating it?

04:21.294 --> 04:21.995
No, I don't.

04:22.035 --> 04:25.638
I was going to say almost always.

04:25.658 --> 04:25.979
Always.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.623
When he points out what's wrong with it, I have not noticed that before.

04:30.643 --> 04:36.068
And when he points it out, I have this immediate acclimation in my head, of course.

04:36.428 --> 04:38.370
Of course, that's right.

04:38.587 --> 04:40.930
Young guy, middle-aged guy?

04:41.150 --> 04:45.255
He's older than I am.

04:45.275 --> 04:50.421
I think he's about middle 50 somewhere.

04:50.442 --> 04:52.344
No kidding.

04:52.364 --> 04:54.547
But he's not much older than I am.

04:54.567 --> 04:55.007
I'm 54.

04:55.107 --> 04:56.169
I like him, I think.

04:56.269 --> 04:58.031
I mean, I hope I score him.

04:58.051 --> 05:01.695
The nice thing about my friend Ward Judge.

05:01.855 --> 05:02.196
Nice man.

05:02.296 --> 05:05.400
He's been a good writer.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.003
I sent him the Newsweek.

05:07.983 --> 05:23.345
review, our most underrated writer, and said, if you want to quarrel about who this really is, I'll listen.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.650
I don't know why we're just as...

05:26.630 --> 05:28.453
Extolled into the universe.

05:28.473 --> 05:29.756
He is so good.

05:30.116 --> 05:33.903
And the translator was his signature book.

05:33.923 --> 05:36.888
Really, it's a tremendously effective book.

05:37.049 --> 05:37.790
It's wonderful.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.874
What a hell of a piece of work.

05:41.477 --> 05:42.799
And nobody read it.

05:42.779 --> 05:48.605
And he says that nobody knows how to publish a bestseller anymore.

05:48.745 --> 05:54.370
Au contraire, I wrote, and a damn good thing for us.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.412
They do know how to publish bestsellers.

05:56.432 --> 05:59.075
The thing is, we don't write it.

05:59.095 --> 06:01.637
Bestsellers are for people who watch Blossom.

06:01.657 --> 06:05.741
Bestsellers are for people who watch, I don't know, whatever the soap operas are.

06:05.761 --> 06:06.182
Oprah Winfrey.

06:06.202 --> 06:06.442
Yeah, Oprah.

06:06.462 --> 06:09.765
The only way we ever get a bestseller is to go on Oprah, Oprah,

06:10.741 --> 06:18.262
I can go on and say I was molested by a priest in Fall River 30 years ago, and then I'll sell a lot of books.

06:18.302 --> 06:19.345
Except I won't say that.

06:23.096 --> 06:26.505
Unfortunately, the publishing houses are, it's all sales.

06:26.485 --> 06:27.908
I believe it.

06:27.928 --> 06:29.411
Holt does not.

06:29.692 --> 06:31.856
Holt does not know how to publish bestsellers.

06:32.317 --> 06:32.818
They do.

06:33.299 --> 06:34.662
Sue Grafton is a bestseller.

06:35.063 --> 06:38.550
They're very fortunate.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.897
Henry Holt and Company published good books.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.701
I was astonished to discover...

06:43.934 --> 07:08.693
in public this weekly, that Laurel was in such deep trouble because I noticed only quite recently, but it's first, it's first, but it was only recently and quite tardily that I noticed that a great many of the books that I buy and enjoy thoroughly and respect a lot

07:09.449 --> 07:12.053
published by William Morrow.

07:12.073 --> 07:23.252
And I went for that to say to my wife, I don't know, within this year, she said, if something ever happens to McCray, I ought to think of a whole of Morrow, rather.

07:23.593 --> 07:29.483
And then I read all this stuff, so I was talking to my agent, and I said, what the hell ever happened to Morrow?

07:29.463 --> 07:47.505
And she said essentially the same thing either.

07:47.485 --> 07:56.972
They astound themselves when they get a bestseller.

07:58.496 --> 07:59.600
I mean, F.S.G.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.806
can't believe they've got Scott Jarreau, you know.

08:01.826 --> 08:02.929
And he won't leave them.

08:02.909 --> 08:19.855
He's a pretty nice guy.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.736
You know what he's ever met him?

08:20.756 --> 08:20.876
Never.

08:20.896 --> 08:20.996
Yeah.

08:21.016 --> 08:21.417
I like the last one.

08:21.437 --> 08:24.141
I wanted to think about that, but really in terms of independently owned public analysis, you have FSG, you have Oak Mill and Oak John.

08:24.425 --> 08:42.351
It's right.

08:42.371 --> 08:43.132
It's a subsidiary of a German company.

08:43.152 --> 08:43.332
Holtz is?

08:43.352 --> 08:44.214
I thought they were an independent company.

08:44.234 --> 08:44.294
No.

08:44.314 --> 08:45.315
I've forgotten the name of the German company now.

08:45.335 --> 08:46.036
It's named for the guy who owns it.

08:46.056 --> 08:46.537
He's an existing person.

08:46.557 --> 08:47.038
So now I'll get into it.

08:47.058 --> 08:48.019
I mean, Holtz-Rifflin is an independent company.
