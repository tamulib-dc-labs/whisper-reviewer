But more on that later.

01:00.848 --> 01:03.272
Let's begin with the super marketers.

01:03.793 --> 01:13.147
Drawing on the most compelling and famous marketing examples, noted author Robert Heller shares with you the ten guidelines that can make you a super marketer.

01:13.828 --> 01:18.735
Let's listen in on the fourth one, marketing to get and keep customers.

01:19.356 --> 01:27.008
Some marketers make the mistake of trying to make the market respond to their product instead of having their product respond to the market.

01:27.545 --> 01:35.055
In the past, this has been the typical Detroit procedure, to build a car and then try to identify its buyers.

01:35.736 --> 01:45.289
But the story of the birth of Ford's Mustang is a classic case of doing it the right way, a case of a market in search of a product and not the other way around.

01:46.450 --> 01:53.620
Ford's research had shown clearly that there was a real market for a car with an unmistakable youthful image.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.589
so the car makers were able to tailor their new Mustang for a hungry new market.

01:59.331 --> 02:02.337
But the approach was a little more sophisticated than that.

02:03.239 --> 02:14.241
First, Ford went about making the market powerfully aware of its hunger, and then it satisfied that appetite with a plentiful supply of a car with three marketing points.

02:14.575 --> 02:18.400
great styling, strong performance, and a low price.

02:19.081 --> 02:24.688
Now, let's hear some innovative techniques you can use to escape common organizational traps.

02:25.429 --> 02:37.624
In The Effective Executive, Peter Drucker, considered the father of the science of management, shows you how to develop skills that fulfill the ultimate management goal, getting things done right.

02:38.105 --> 02:42.490
Effectiveness is a habit, by which I mean a complex of practices.

02:42.689 --> 02:44.551
and practices can always be learned.

02:44.992 --> 02:50.718
There is no reason why anyone with normal endowment should not acquire competence in any practice.

02:51.379 --> 02:56.645
There are essentially five practices that have to be acquired to be an effective executive.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.949
One, managing time effectively.

03:00.650 --> 03:06.857
Two, focusing on one's overall contribution rather than on the details of work to be done.

03:07.445 --> 03:13.030
Three, building on one's strengths and those of superiors, colleagues, and subordinates.

03:13.851 --> 03:17.354
Four, setting priorities and staying with those decisions.

03:17.995 --> 03:25.682
Five, making effective decisions, basing judgments on dissenting opinions rather than on consensus on the facts.

03:26.463 --> 03:29.406
Next, we have Robert Half on hiring.

03:29.906 --> 03:35.832
Here, nationally recognized employment expert Robert Half shows you how to hire the right people.

03:36.166 --> 03:39.429
Most executives base their hiring decisions on intuition.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.652
Here's what Robert Half has to say about that.

03:43.813 --> 03:45.535
Avoid the cloning trap.

03:46.215 --> 03:52.521
It's human nature to be drawn to people whose background and thinking are similar to your own, but you may shortchange yourself.

03:53.162 --> 04:03.051
The predictable result of hiring mirror images is that a company or department will be strong in those areas in which you are strong, weak in those areas in which you are weak.

04:03.672 --> 04:07.236
The most successful companies have diversity in their top management team.

04:08.158 --> 04:10.440
Hiring should be based on balance.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.484
You should select people with an eye on how they fit the team.

04:14.726 --> 04:18.010
Hiring strong people can only enhance your career.

04:18.631 --> 04:24.358
They will not only improve the efficiency of your department, but you will become known as someone who hires winners.

04:24.878 --> 04:27.081
That's not a bad reputation to have.

04:27.803 --> 04:37.316
Finally, let's explore the intricacies of making effective speeches and presentations with lessons from our master communicator himself, Steve Allen.

04:37.976 --> 04:46.047
In How to Make a Speech, Allen draws from 40 years of experience at the podium with such tried and tested methods as this one.

04:46.407 --> 04:48.390
It's important to get the feel of your audience.

04:48.871 --> 04:54.418
If you're not sure about the bias and emotions of those you're addressing, just to listen to their responses.

04:54.955 --> 05:03.384
While making a campaign speech, a candidate was trying to discover the dominant religion of his audience, and he began by saying, My great-grandfather was an Episcopalian.

05:03.764 --> 05:04.685
There was stony silence.

05:05.025 --> 05:08.709
But, he continued, My great-grandmother belonged to the Congregational Church.

05:09.530 --> 05:11.031
Again, silence.

05:11.051 --> 05:13.694
My grandfather was a Baptist.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.335
More silence.

05:14.595 --> 05:16.397
While my grandmother was a Presbyterian.

05:16.797 --> 05:17.598
Still nothing.

05:18.459 --> 05:20.221
But I had a great-aunt who was a Methodist.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.342
Yay!

05:21.522 --> 05:22.363
Loud applause.

05:22.597 --> 05:25.082
and I have always followed my great aunt.

05:25.102 --> 05:25.823
Sustained cheering.

05:25.903 --> 05:26.705
The man was elected.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.949
The point's really a simple one.

05:29.249 --> 05:34.058
It'll be to your advantage to know how your audience feels about the subject on which you're speaking.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.188
You need not ingratiate yourself with them, if that's not your purpose, but you should know where they stand.

05:41.699 --> 05:46.125
