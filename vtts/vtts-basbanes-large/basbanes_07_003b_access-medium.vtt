WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:04.230
and didn't have a lot of money.

00:04.390 --> 00:05.231
Dick Manning was a lawyer?

00:05.451 --> 00:06.152
Was he a lawyer?

00:06.292 --> 00:07.353
I think he was.

00:07.453 --> 00:07.834
What was he?

00:07.874 --> 00:08.935
He was in college.

00:09.395 --> 00:10.336
Was he in college out here?

00:10.637 --> 00:11.197
Dick Manning?

00:11.418 --> 00:12.459
No, Richard Manning now.

00:12.559 --> 00:14.661
Yeah, mediators we're talking.

00:14.741 --> 00:15.102
I know.

00:17.124 --> 00:19.106
He said he used to come in to us in Hollywood.

00:19.366 --> 00:20.348
Maybe when he came to town.

00:21.249 --> 00:22.330
Because we don't remember.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.492
But he was never a big collector in those days.

00:25.253 --> 00:26.494
We never had anything big.

00:26.514 --> 00:29.818
He started buying, what, seven years ago?

00:30.423 --> 00:55.553
seven when i interviewed him in march it was seven years ago he said uh yeah not surprised but he wanted this room you know and he saw the room and it was and this is for me you know there's his wife and he said between them they buy about 500 things a year things things i mean that means you have to buy something every day more today you got to buy two things tomorrow he said they're average just 500 i mean it's maybe a book it may be a gorgeous piece of uh

00:55.972 --> 00:59.696
They must have a busy life, running out every day to find new things.

00:59.716 --> 01:00.678
And they give stuff.

01:01.398 --> 01:03.401
He says, we're junkies, and I hate that phrase.

01:03.441 --> 01:08.066
I wish we didn't find another word, but it just has this other connotation.

01:08.086 --> 01:12.411
Can you tell me some interesting stories, collecting stories of people?

01:12.431 --> 01:19.920
I'm going to have to leave in about five minutes, because every Tuesday night for the last ten years, I have two other friends that I go out with.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.229
I unfortunately do not have any thanks whatsoever, so I can spend the evening with you.

01:24.309 --> 01:26.013
Let's just chat a little bit.

01:26.033 --> 01:28.698
Okay, so if you'll excuse me, my pleasure.

01:28.718 --> 01:29.841
It's really great.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.344
I'll lock the door behind you.

01:31.364 --> 01:32.486
I'll see you in the morning.

01:32.867 --> 01:33.028
Okay.

01:33.268 --> 01:33.669
Okay?

01:33.689 --> 01:34.391
Nice seeing you.

01:34.671 --> 01:34.992
Good night.

01:35.052 --> 01:35.753
Appreciate it.

01:35.773 --> 01:37.317
My pleasure.

01:37.337 --> 01:37.437
Okay.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.924
I will indeed, thank you.

01:41.944 --> 01:51.033
Just by chance, the deaccessioning issue just came up, and we were talking with Mell yesterday, and did he say something about they do deaccession, or they're looking, they will?

01:51.053 --> 01:55.097
Yeah, Mell Abelstein, I'm forgetting, we were talking about yesterday.

01:55.117 --> 01:59.802
He said that they, at some point, they're going to be having some wonderful secrets down there.

01:59.902 --> 02:02.365
Are they going to sell them at auctions, aren't they?

02:02.385 --> 02:07.710
I asked about that, and it didn't sound like it was one of the auctions.

02:08.365 --> 02:09.386
But it may.

02:10.327 --> 02:12.909
He was vague, okay, on that.

02:13.390 --> 02:18.675
But the point is, you know, I guess they're going to be accession duplicates.

02:18.755 --> 02:19.635
Texas doesn't.

02:20.056 --> 02:23.039
You know, Texas has... Someday that may change.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.761
When they get sensible about it.

02:25.801 --> 02:26.862
Well, it's a state, you know.

02:27.062 --> 02:27.683
They really do.

02:27.743 --> 02:29.384
It's a state-owned thing.

02:29.405 --> 02:33.989
I understand, but certainly there are probably things that they would like in the future that they'd be able to obtain.

02:34.009 --> 02:37.032
Yeah, but also they might want to trade, which is kind of interesting.

02:37.192 --> 02:37.512
Oh, yeah.

02:37.694 --> 02:41.138
Well, we've occasionally done that because that would make more sense to them.

02:41.178 --> 02:42.959
They can't use the funds.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.783
Frequently, when they do sell something, the funds does not go back into their own budget.

02:46.803 --> 02:50.808
It goes into a general budget and doesn't go directly into acquisitions.

02:50.848 --> 02:55.693
It may go into putting in your room or whatever, and so they just as soon keep it.

02:55.713 --> 03:00.278
Can you tell me some good Zeitlin stories or Howell stories?

03:00.438 --> 03:02.720
I'm looking for some nice anecdotal things, too.

03:02.740 --> 03:07.465
About, you know, a little bit of stories come to mind.

03:08.390 --> 03:13.675
You know, every bookseller knows stories, many of which he really doesn't want in print.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.636
That's the problem.

03:14.656 --> 03:18.220
I mean, I really have had personal experiences many years.

03:18.340 --> 03:26.649
Every Tuesday I would have lunch with Jake Seidling for the last five or six years before his death, because we were neighbors right next door.

03:26.669 --> 03:28.971
And he shared a lot with me.

03:29.331 --> 03:33.756
He did tell me his greatest regret in his life was that he never kept eternal.

03:33.888 --> 03:35.410
There is an oral history of him, though.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.771
Oh, it's an oral history, yeah.

03:36.851 --> 03:40.115
He was interviewed, but it was one thing to be interviewed and another thing to be interviewed.

03:40.135 --> 03:41.276
At least there's something recorded.

03:42.117 --> 03:42.898
And I had to see it.

03:42.918 --> 03:43.758
I had to see it.

03:43.778 --> 03:46.441
I just learned of its existence.

03:46.461 --> 03:47.402
But did he teach you a lot?

03:49.605 --> 03:53.068
Kind of what you're saying to me is that you and your brother, you kind of learned on the fly.

03:53.769 --> 04:02.258
I don't know that I've... I actually think Jake was a remarkable man, but I don't think he was a remarkable businessman.

04:02.457 --> 04:05.022
I think he was a reasonably poor businessman.

04:05.423 --> 04:07.667
I'm talking business.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.971
As a book lover, he was a great book lover.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.194
He was a great book man.

04:11.474 --> 04:15.202
I'm just saying, but as a businessman, I think he was that.

04:16.684 --> 04:20.512
Is that the key to success in this business?

04:20.532 --> 04:21.454
Well, it is business.

04:21.634 --> 04:23.217
I mean, people try to

04:23.652 --> 04:23.932
It is.

04:24.072 --> 04:27.977
I mean, the reason that this shop works is because we conduct it as a business.

04:28.317 --> 04:33.903
We do not hide books that we feel that we love and we know are wonderful.

04:33.943 --> 04:35.224
It's our favorite book.

04:35.244 --> 04:36.326
We're selling a product.

04:36.626 --> 04:37.587
It's wonderful.

04:37.607 --> 04:41.671
I mean, that's one of the reasons that I think we do well.

04:41.731 --> 04:51.702
I know there are a lot of sour grapes about us, but I believe that there would be about anybody who does well in any profession.

04:52.070 --> 04:56.224
the high up yard, there's always somebody who feels, and I don't personalize it at all.

04:56.491 --> 05:02.339
because I feel that I'm satisfied with who I am, and everybody else has to deal with their own problems.

05:02.459 --> 05:09.408
I certainly don't read any of it, and frankly, if it's criticism, and I frankly haven't heard any criticism, do you?

05:09.468 --> 05:12.092
I've heard veiled solid breaks, maybe.

05:12.112 --> 05:17.239
I think there's a cynicism about how we achieved what we achieved.

05:17.259 --> 05:22.226
I mean, oh yeah, right, if somebody gave you $10 million, you know, you could do the same thing.

05:22.246 --> 05:25.570
I mean, really, I'm surprised that you told me that you were in the real estate business.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.530
Well, I'm not alone in the real estate business.

05:27.550 --> 05:29.473
You've never been in the real estate business?

05:29.493 --> 05:31.958
I've never been in the real estate business.

05:32.078 --> 05:42.495
I had customers that I, at one time in 1976 to 1980, who were in the real estate business, who were helping me, and I was selling them books, and they were selling me some buildings.

05:42.779 --> 05:45.602
I mean, this is very modest compared to it.

05:45.622 --> 05:45.903
No, no, no.

05:45.923 --> 05:51.009
I mean, it's not like you had an office over there where you were buying and selling beautiful homes in Beverly Hills.

05:51.029 --> 05:51.970
That was my impression that you did.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.412
That's what I heard.

05:53.492 --> 05:54.493
I told my wife this.

05:54.513 --> 05:55.855
I said, so-and-so told me.

05:56.355 --> 06:00.360
Well, we owned a half a dozen apartment buildings, and we sold them and bought this and the hotel.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.302
But to buy this piece of property.

06:02.342 --> 06:05.927
I mean, even this piece of property, we bought it $1,400,000.

06:06.027 --> 06:06.648
It's expensive.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.630
We had to put $800,000 to get it started.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.233
So we sold off some of the more modest, but we didn't have it.

06:11.534 --> 06:18.781
No, that's, you know, hey, that's not what I'm saying.

06:18.801 --> 06:20.022
But we're not in the real world.

06:20.042 --> 06:24.767
A couple of business, a couple of tycoons, you know, in the real, so that's a mess.

06:24.927 --> 06:39.060
Well, that's because we're fairly aggressive at sales, and the reason we are is because Ben and I have the same conviction about auctions, that every auction has opportunities, and if you go to a sale and you pick out the things you want and you're waiting and you miss them, you're disappointed,

06:39.361 --> 06:42.225
We're almost always prepared to bid on every lot in the sale.

06:42.526 --> 06:47.674
You ask Christie's or Sotheby's, and they'll tell you, if we come to the sale, they know there's not much that's going to get bored.

06:47.694 --> 06:49.376
You got a permanent paddle?

06:49.396 --> 06:50.198
Oh, yeah.

06:50.218 --> 06:51.440
What are your numbers?

06:51.660 --> 06:54.144
I don't remember my number.

06:54.244 --> 06:55.986
I never even raise my paddle, to tell you the truth.

06:56.267 --> 06:57.429
I raise my hand, and they write it down.

06:57.489 --> 06:59.111
I never even pick up the paddle.

06:59.312 --> 07:00.253
I think Quarage is 57.

07:00.413 --> 07:03.278
I mean, I know them.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.760
I'm just curious.

07:04.820 --> 07:05.721
I honestly don't.

07:05.761 --> 07:07.444
You sit upstairs sometimes, too.

07:07.677 --> 07:12.482
Well, every once in a while, not generally, and I don't, I did because I was joining somebody.

07:12.502 --> 07:14.864
What are you up to here, Tim?

07:14.884 --> 07:17.827
It's $20, I'm not going to be an awesome position now, you're a babysitter.

07:18.628 --> 07:19.869
It's beautiful.

07:19.889 --> 07:21.190
Tell me, do I know you?

07:21.351 --> 07:21.811
This is David.

07:21.831 --> 07:22.892
No, I'm Nick Basman.

07:23.152 --> 07:29.899
I'm a writer, and that's my wife, Connie, and we're out here, writing a book on the book world.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.160
Yeah?

07:31.260 --> 07:33.182
Prominent members thereof.

07:33.603 --> 07:34.984
Good place to start.

07:35.183 --> 07:39.232
David has been binding for how many years?

07:42.260 --> 07:43.021
Since he was 14.

07:43.202 --> 07:46.409
Where did you learn the craft?

07:46.810 --> 07:51.842
I learned it in a number of places, but mostly in the school of training.

07:52.632 --> 07:58.682
Did you go into this because the family's in the book business?

07:58.702 --> 08:04.752
Well, I figured it was the only way that I could stick around here, you know, to learn something about the book business.

08:04.772 --> 08:07.837
I wasn't a very good salesman.

08:08.698 --> 08:13.626
I was committed to being a book finder when I was about 14 years old.

08:14.107 --> 08:14.728
Why?

08:14.768 --> 08:15.289
What happened?

08:15.589 --> 08:18.454
Well, because it was the only thing that I could see at the time.

08:18.923 --> 08:21.028
He was actually working as a rapper or something.

08:21.068 --> 08:25.999
And dilute corners on books and things like that.

08:26.019 --> 08:29.607
A $10,000 book one time fell apart in my hands, and I felt so guilty about it.

08:29.627 --> 08:30.048
Right.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.491
You're trying to recover ever since.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.434
What was the book?

08:32.454 --> 08:33.877
Oh, he doesn't remember.

08:33.937 --> 08:35.460
It was a large plate book.

08:36.302 --> 08:37.084
That doesn't tell us.

08:37.537 --> 08:40.981
I remember that you kept saying, well, where's that book?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.483
We're still looking for it, Dave, by the way.

08:42.503 --> 08:44.586
When we find it, we're going to be in touch with you on here.

08:44.626 --> 08:45.207
I got back to England.

08:45.247 --> 08:47.069
It was the first thing I worked on.

08:47.089 --> 08:48.030
Well, he went over to England.

08:48.050 --> 08:49.832
We sent him there for a year to study.

08:50.353 --> 08:51.655
That helped out a lot.

08:51.675 --> 08:53.277
Did I bring you a close-up, by the way?

08:53.297 --> 08:54.618
No, we're open tonight.

08:54.638 --> 08:55.560
This is lessons.

08:55.580 --> 08:56.741
Oh, you have classes tonight?

08:56.761 --> 08:57.182
Yeah.

08:57.202 --> 08:59.745
Well, the reason I was late is because of my car.

08:59.765 --> 09:00.946
I worked with a battery panel.

09:00.966 --> 09:01.387
Oh, really?

09:01.407 --> 09:01.627
Yeah.

09:01.647 --> 09:03.109
I left the air conditioner around.

09:03.129 --> 09:03.910
Oh, so you had to tell.

09:03.950 --> 09:05.532
Okay, because I was wondering, I asked about you.

09:05.873 --> 09:07.054
Yeah, I worked with a battery.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.083
I've covered a lot, Tom.

09:10.123 --> 09:15.791
Is there anything I missed?

09:15.811 --> 09:21.960
I just want to... My wife tells me I'm pretty repetitive sometimes, asking the same question.

09:21.980 --> 09:26.547
Well, sometimes you repeat the question when you're not satisfied with the first answer.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.032
That's about what I'm feeling.

09:30.072 --> 09:32.856
She's a social worker, right?

09:33.157 --> 09:35.160
people say whatever they want to say.

09:36.061 --> 09:37.443
Well, we know better, right?

09:37.463 --> 09:38.445
Well, we know better.

09:40.127 --> 09:41.169
Exactly.

09:41.189 --> 09:50.002
But really, I am interested in how you feel when you see some customers come in and go crazy over a printable.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.204
Do you empathize with that?

09:52.085 --> 09:53.607
Does it bemuse you in any way?

09:53.948 --> 09:57.453
No, I think... Do you share that passion?

09:58.014 --> 10:02.961
Well, you can help but get wrapped up in a little bit, but we see it often enough when people walk in this place.

10:03.278 --> 10:09.526
They're overwhelmed frequently, because these books are available for sale, and they're really surprised at that.

10:09.566 --> 10:15.534
We see it often enough that it's hard to get the same level of enthusiasm, you know?

10:16.155 --> 10:18.518
And so it's sort of like watching the birth process.

10:18.578 --> 10:20.721
The first time I saw it was, I believe, with the second time.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.966
You know, if you had 36 children, say, oh, my baby, you know?

10:24.106 --> 10:25.648
Yeah, you'd send it in if you had one of the kids.

10:26.349 --> 10:27.550
Right.

10:27.570 --> 10:32.577
So although we share some of the enthusiasm, and we recognize that it's

10:33.029 --> 10:40.696
You couldn't be a bibliomaniac, personally.

10:40.756 --> 10:42.197
You don't see it in your fabric.

10:42.257 --> 10:46.361
I think that I have to have a touch of it in me to have what I have.

10:46.941 --> 10:47.462
I really do.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.344
I think it's beyond coincidence that I'm in the book business.

10:50.744 --> 10:54.768
I'll give you this thing, by the way, I wrote called My First Year in the Business.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.368
I'd like that.

10:55.749 --> 10:59.452
It's just a three- or four-page article on how I got into the book business.

10:59.472 --> 11:02.935
I think that would be very useful.

11:03.438 --> 11:05.782
It's really mostly about Compton in my first year.

11:05.802 --> 11:09.006
It's more humorous than anything else, but it's truthful, as I recall.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.951
It's a very important thing.

11:12.312 --> 11:15.737
I expect that I'll call you at some point, too, to go over some things.

11:15.757 --> 11:17.499
You say, what does everything you say mean?

11:20.123 --> 11:23.809
You know, the beauty of these interviews is everyone is

11:24.025 --> 11:27.828
been different, and I've always come away with something I didn't expect.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.952
Well, I'm much more frivolous than most people.

11:31.992 --> 11:39.299
I mean, I really love what I do, but I don't take this business as seriously as most people in this business do.

11:39.319 --> 11:48.447
I mean, it's really fortuitous to be in a business where all your customers are basically pretty happy, financially well-off people.

11:48.647 --> 11:50.409
I mean, with fair exceptions, of course.

11:50.689 --> 11:51.990
The average guy who comes in this store,

11:52.223 --> 11:54.186
He's prepared to buy something fairly expensive.

11:54.266 --> 11:56.429
So chances are he's been fairly successful in life.

11:56.849 --> 11:57.951
He's indulging himself.

11:57.991 --> 11:59.613
Nobody needs what I have to sell.

12:00.274 --> 12:01.015
Who needs rare books?

12:01.656 --> 12:03.638
I mean, I have to create that interest, right?

12:04.239 --> 12:04.740
Do you think so?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.844
I don't, because nobody really, I don't think, nobody needs it.

12:07.864 --> 12:08.945
Nobody has to create that interest to me.

12:08.985 --> 12:09.446
I don't know.

12:09.606 --> 12:10.908
I want, my interest is here.

12:10.928 --> 12:11.509
Oh, I know.

12:11.529 --> 12:13.732
You just have to point the things out to me.

12:13.832 --> 12:17.016
I know, but I'm talking about life's essentials.

12:17.317 --> 12:19.680
I mean, really, what is the priority?

12:20.321 --> 12:22.705
Sometimes it's really confusing to most books.

12:22.745 --> 12:30.616
If you ask any bookseller in the most honest moment, you know, does he really totally believe that this book is worth $50,000?

12:30.636 --> 12:35.764
I mean, $50,000 is the purchasing power of it versus other things in this world.

12:35.804 --> 12:37.547
It's really confusing sometimes.

12:37.647 --> 12:40.351
What's your answer to that question?

12:40.691 --> 12:42.794
Oh, I think it's absolutely a personal decision.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.016
I mean, I just...

12:44.418 --> 12:49.184
Whenever I tell a person, don't be silly, don't buy it, I almost always sell it, right?

12:49.204 --> 12:52.168
If I say, oh, you have to have this book, you can't live without it, I don't believe that.

12:52.209 --> 12:53.650
I think you can live without everything.

12:53.671 --> 12:56.214
Although, I'll tell you one thing that Jake Zayton told me you could put this down.

12:58.797 --> 13:01.401
One day I had a client who was looking at a book for $3,000.

13:01.601 --> 13:02.543
He was thinking about it.

13:02.923 --> 13:04.125
He said, well, I don't know.

13:04.405 --> 13:06.568
And I said, well, I don't know.

13:06.708 --> 13:07.770
And he said, yeah, I'll take it.

13:07.970 --> 13:08.330
I'll take it.

13:08.390 --> 13:09.332
And I said, great.

13:09.352 --> 13:10.714
And I said, you know, I'm surprised you're buying it.

13:10.734 --> 13:11.675
It doesn't fit in your collection.

13:11.695 --> 13:13.277
And he said, you know,

13:13.443 --> 13:14.205
You're right, it doesn't.

13:14.366 --> 13:15.068
Maybe I won't take it.

13:15.148 --> 13:15.569
Put it back.

13:15.990 --> 13:23.993
And then I told Jake, because I had lunch with him that day, and he said, you know, he says, the one thing you should learn in this business, when a customer says, I'll take it, you stop talking.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.117
And it was pretty simple.

13:26.457 --> 13:26.998
I said, you're right.

13:27.018 --> 13:28.179
You know, and I made it.

13:28.199 --> 13:30.142
I got home and said, I can't believe it.

13:30.162 --> 13:33.086
I probably still have the book in my safe if you want to see it.

13:33.106 --> 13:33.587
I don't remember.

13:33.607 --> 13:34.648
But the point is, it's true.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.270
When a customer says, you know, I'll take it.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.233
There's a time, there's a time to shut up.

13:38.293 --> 13:38.673
Yeah, right.

13:38.934 --> 13:40.476
If anything, I get a little too chatty.

13:40.496 --> 13:42.038
And that time, I've since learned.

13:42.078 --> 13:43.299
I've never done that since.

13:43.319 --> 13:44.481
Because it's a personal decision.

13:44.761 --> 13:46.303
Why should I question what he should have?

13:46.363 --> 13:49.427
Well, how about if the guy says, $3,000 is too much, I give you $2,500.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.831
We do not do that.

13:51.871 --> 13:53.693
I mean, I occasionally, uh, I,

13:54.297 --> 14:03.830
I think every bookseller occasionally will be flexible in the price, you know, unless it's something he just acquired or he has other people for.

14:04.812 --> 14:08.697
And he knows how much money he has.

14:08.797 --> 14:14.225
Listen, I had a call from Warner Brothers today, and they were buying a person for the head of Warner Brothers.

14:14.245 --> 14:17.149
I don't know who it is, and it's $750, and they called me back and said,

14:17.399 --> 14:21.547
We decided, this guy calls me, Mr. Weinstein, we'll give you $500 for this book.

14:21.587 --> 14:22.388
And I said, excuse me?

14:22.568 --> 14:23.670
I said, it's priced $750.

14:23.751 --> 14:24.292
Is it priced $500?

14:24.332 --> 14:25.273
He said, no, it's $750.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.037
He said, no, it's $750.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.401
He says, well, how about $550?

14:29.421 --> 14:31.645
And I said, go buy it someplace else.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.719
And just out of principle, I would never do that.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.507
And then the guy finally confessed to me, said, listen, I'm fairly new here.

14:37.527 --> 14:41.855
I'm only 22 years old, and I thought it would be good if I could buy it and it would look good on my record.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.198
We don't do that as a rule.

14:43.499 --> 14:48.829
I have clients that make enormous purchases who are very consistent that I would spend a 10% discount to.

14:48.909 --> 14:52.236
Which is kind of standard.

14:52.376 --> 14:52.917
Yeah, right.

14:52.937 --> 14:54.460
But that's it.

14:54.608 --> 14:59.473
Out of principle, if a stranger walked in and said, would you take such and such a choice now?

14:59.493 --> 15:03.877
Especially if you, as a collector, know that the price is fair.

15:04.298 --> 15:05.379
Yeah, if it's right.

15:05.459 --> 15:09.102
Well, if I feel there's a justification that the book is in less than wonderful condition.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.845
Oh, yeah, and if I say, gee, did you know that this is missing a leaf?

15:12.225 --> 15:15.068
Well, then I was definitely making a justification.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.671
Yeah, the spine is cracked like daddy goes off.

15:17.691 --> 15:19.593
That doesn't happen.

15:19.693 --> 15:22.756
No, but I think everybody is flexible.

15:22.776 --> 15:24.177
I think it's important to be flexible.

15:24.595 --> 15:28.480
Some people are fairly stubborn about it, and I think it's silly.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.585
Is the L.A.

15:31.605 --> 15:40.357
collective a distinctive, I was going to say, unique creature?

15:40.437 --> 15:43.601
Well, a lot of income.

15:43.661 --> 15:47.306
In many cases made quickly over the last couple of years.

15:49.329 --> 15:51.131
I have 7,000 people on my mailing list.

15:51.212 --> 15:52.273
I'll bet you at least

15:53.755 --> 15:57.058
Between 500 and 1,000 are worth a million dollars or more.

15:57.078 --> 16:05.247
I mean, I have a lot of wealthy customers on my mailing list, and I'll bet you 100 of them are worth 25 million more, 50 million, I mean, really big numbers.

16:05.927 --> 16:10.292
I mean, I don't know the numbers, because I mean, I have to look at Forbes and figure it out.

16:10.712 --> 16:14.316
I know at least 10 customers that are worth a half a billion dollars that are on my mailing list.

16:14.416 --> 16:18.480
Half a billion would be 500 million dollars.

16:18.781 --> 16:20.804
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

16:20.864 --> 16:24.831
You know, it doesn't matter because, no, they're not people coming every week and visit me.

16:24.851 --> 16:29.018
I mean, people, most, the richer they are, the less often I see them.

16:29.038 --> 16:31.382
That doesn't, and more often I don't work directly with them.

16:31.722 --> 16:34.547
The biggest customers I have, I don't even work with them, to tell you the truth.

16:34.567 --> 16:39.255
I meet them once, I meet their librarian, their assistant, their assistants are their assistants.

16:39.275 --> 16:39.375
Yeah.

16:40.857 --> 16:42.460
But I don't mind them.

16:44.093 --> 16:45.395
One or two other questions.

16:45.415 --> 16:46.637
Tell me about the Gutenberg.

16:47.098 --> 16:52.065
There's a stained-glass window where you and your brother are represented in it.

16:52.105 --> 16:53.648
Tell me a little bit about that.

16:53.668 --> 17:02.401
Well, actually, that's described in the brochure, but basically it's... But the brochure doesn't say that you and Ben are pictured there.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.764
I think it does.

17:03.924 --> 17:06.608
It says that it was unknown who the...

17:07.178 --> 17:11.726
printers were in this early Badis Ascentius woodcutter spelt in there.

17:11.926 --> 17:14.771
Although we spelt Badis Ascentius wrong, I found out.

17:14.811 --> 17:17.596
We have one letter off, and we're going to work on that.

17:17.977 --> 17:18.658
But that was just it.

17:18.919 --> 17:25.871
When we put this place together, we were trying to do something a little different, because there's so little creativity in our business, that's all.

17:26.452 --> 17:30.098
And I think we've accomplished that, because it is a different feeling.

17:30.601 --> 17:38.771
And you'll come in here on the Saturdays and we have a lot of our regulars in here who come in every Saturday and they'll spend $500 to $5,000 and they're professional people.

17:39.472 --> 17:49.524
But you have to sell a lot of, even sell, you know, they did a census in my business just this past year of the 400 members of the ABAA, which is our trade organization.

17:50.044 --> 17:51.386
You're president.

17:51.827 --> 17:52.968
Past president, right.

17:53.909 --> 18:00.557
Of the 400 members, over 200 members grossed less than $100,000 a year.

18:02.528 --> 18:07.558
And so, of the 400 members, I think there were less than 20 that grossed a million.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.762
That's how small the business was.

18:09.782 --> 18:12.768
So really, the Iraq figures to indicate that you're at the top of the field.

18:12.948 --> 18:15.974
I wasn't familiar with the census.

18:16.154 --> 18:16.515
Yeah.

18:16.535 --> 18:19.741
Well, I'm telling you, it's— Who's close to you?

18:19.761 --> 18:24.570
Well, probably the biggest grossing books, I assume, is Krauss in this country.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.407
Or you could say Strand.

18:26.528 --> 18:27.088
Or Argosy.

18:27.128 --> 18:28.951
I don't know what Argosy does.

18:28.971 --> 18:30.433
Well, yeah, but I'm talking about rare books.

18:30.453 --> 18:31.975
Those are volume used books.

18:31.995 --> 18:34.979
Yeah, because Strand, you know, Strand is a unique creature.

18:36.642 --> 18:37.403
Review books.

18:37.583 --> 18:44.392
But I don't, you know, it's never really been something I've thought of a great deal about.

18:44.412 --> 18:51.002
But I show you one thing, that in the future, if we don't, we're going to do something very dramatic in this business.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.684
I mean, very dramatic, like...

18:53.660 --> 19:00.287
What we're going to, if we don't expand dramatically or really build, we're going to have a large impact, you know, on the market in the future.

19:00.527 --> 19:01.508
I'm working on some things now.

19:01.528 --> 19:02.249
You've been new as a group?

19:02.269 --> 19:03.450
Are you an individual?

19:03.470 --> 19:12.660
Well, I've been, we've been actually, and I'd prefer if you didn't publish this, we've been offered to buy our company, I buy a very large company with a disc shop.

19:13.041 --> 19:19.988
We've been approached to buy us out there early in the year, and a lot of people in the business know about it, I don't know if you've heard it, buy a large company with a

19:20.407 --> 19:25.554
enormous portfolio who want to make a very serious purchase in their books and want the best to spearhead it.

19:25.574 --> 19:33.506
And we have negotiated for several months to buy me out and open a shop in New York and London, and that's why I said there's a possibility.

19:33.666 --> 19:36.971
My book is not coming out for another year and a half.

19:37.111 --> 19:38.773
It will be done or not done by that.

19:38.793 --> 19:40.195
This should all be resolved.

19:40.376 --> 19:42.439
It will be resolved in 90 days.

19:42.979 --> 19:45.503
Well, then I think I'd like to call it back in 90 days.

19:45.523 --> 19:48.287
Well, I mean, I know, I know, we've been

19:48.537 --> 19:51.101
I have contracts sitting in my box for two months, but I haven't.

19:51.121 --> 19:55.427
But these people want, in other words, there's a real possibility you might be out of this business.

19:55.447 --> 19:56.489
No, I wouldn't be out of it all.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.812
I'll be in charge of a very large organization.

19:58.832 --> 20:00.775
I mean, a large business.

20:00.795 --> 20:01.736
You'll have a parent.

20:01.756 --> 20:04.540
I'll have the largest bookshop in the world if this goes through.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.523
I mean, I could have it now if I wanted.

20:06.543 --> 20:16.097
The problem is if I sell out my business, I'm not a sub-Chapter S corporation, which means that if I sell out my business, say for every million dollars I get,

20:16.313 --> 20:22.682
My corporation pays 35 percent tax, and then the money left over goes to me, and I pay 35 percent of that, 40 percent of that.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.604
So I only end up with 30 percent on the dollar.

20:24.985 --> 20:26.647
So it's, right now, it's very unappealing.

20:27.088 --> 20:27.668
Yeah, exactly.

20:27.689 --> 20:31.113
No, but the opportunity they're offering me is what's exciting.

20:31.173 --> 20:32.856
Is this a non-book company?

20:32.896 --> 20:33.456
Nothing new with books.

20:33.476 --> 20:35.119
It's a company that's very cash-heavy.

20:35.579 --> 20:38.023
American or offshore, as they say?

20:38.043 --> 20:39.364
It's an American company.

20:40.386 --> 20:41.788
California-based or New York-based?

20:41.808 --> 20:44.211
Well, they have offices in seven countries.

20:44.613 --> 20:47.417
But there are principal offices in Los Angeles.

20:47.437 --> 20:54.386
But if these people say, hey, there's nobody serious in this business.

20:54.726 --> 20:55.988
There's no serious money in this business.

20:56.008 --> 20:57.109
There's no serious promotion.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.052
What do they see, though?

20:59.212 --> 21:01.235
Do they see a growth industry here?

21:02.857 --> 21:04.299
Well, let's put it this way.

21:04.339 --> 21:05.700
It's a diversification for them.

21:05.740 --> 21:06.942
It would probably, if they put out

21:07.175 --> 21:10.760
$20 million that would represent probably less than 1% of their assets.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.063
So it's just another thing for them.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.326
They're just looking for places to do this.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.411
And I think there's a glamour in the business that they find.

21:18.431 --> 21:19.032
They've been in.

21:19.392 --> 21:20.914
We've spoken to them.

21:20.954 --> 21:22.597
I flew to New York and London with them.

21:22.637 --> 21:24.680
I mean, we've went through this whole thing.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.122
So the talks are ongoing?

21:26.542 --> 21:27.684
The talks have been ongoing.

21:27.724 --> 21:31.870
They've stopped for the last month because I'm having terrible tax problems and it's unappealing.

21:32.270 --> 21:36.456
And I sent there actually last week in London talking to people over there trying to...

21:36.773 --> 21:40.757
who I recommended that I were to run New York and London shop.

21:40.897 --> 21:43.039
He's Joseph and Jim Cummings, the people.

21:43.419 --> 21:44.020
I mean, those are the guys.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.644
I said, I want Jim to run my New York shop and, I mean, part of this thing.

21:47.664 --> 21:49.405
And they would have to buy all three of these.

21:49.425 --> 21:51.888
So there's all the water that trams at the MCI, then.

21:52.248 --> 21:53.790
It's a possibility.

21:54.310 --> 21:54.490
Yeah.

21:54.610 --> 21:57.193
I mean, it's a possibility.

21:57.273 --> 21:58.394
It's a fairly complex.

21:58.434 --> 22:01.657
When can I call you on this?

22:01.677 --> 22:04.620
Well, I mean, things change every day in that

22:04.921 --> 22:17.536
I have stopped negotiating because I have some tax problems that are unappealing, and I told them that if they could work it out with the other individuals, Jim and David, that I would be more inclined to be flexible.

22:17.556 --> 22:23.903
Well, part of the deal, then, part of the proposal is that you would have a store in New York and a store in London.

22:23.923 --> 22:24.444
A retail store.

22:24.464 --> 22:28.368
They want to get right on the street in London, or they want to get right on Madison Avenue.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.491
Would you all have the same name, Heritage?

22:30.511 --> 22:31.252
To be discussed.

22:31.732 --> 22:32.453
I mean, we don't know.

22:32.673 --> 22:34.135
But would you all share the same name?

22:34.300 --> 22:35.241
No, probably not.

22:35.281 --> 22:37.525
It would probably be E. Joseph, a division of heritage.

22:38.726 --> 22:39.828
Of course, it is valuable.

22:40.469 --> 22:41.069
Well, it's great.

22:41.370 --> 22:42.532
It's the future.

22:42.552 --> 22:46.817
It's great because it would be dramatically different and exciting.

22:46.838 --> 22:49.882
We would then have virtually unlimited funds to buy at auction.

22:49.902 --> 22:50.563
We wouldn't have to work.

22:50.783 --> 22:55.149
It was well restricted by availability of cash flow, you know, and things like that.

22:55.229 --> 23:02.940
And these people believe that what I convinced them, and better so than I realized, that there is a limited supply of this product available.

23:03.207 --> 23:13.960
And they're not trying to buy it and hide it or something, but they believe that a person who is aggressive in buying it will really bring out a lot of new people.

23:14.661 --> 23:18.827
They could bring me a lot of people, because they're involved with a lot of other businesses.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.829
So you can't tell me off the record who they are?

23:21.290 --> 23:22.191
Well, it doesn't matter.

23:22.211 --> 23:23.332
It's a corporation.

23:23.392 --> 23:25.315
It's a private corporation.

23:25.435 --> 23:27.257
No, I definitely couldn't tell you how to.

23:27.575 --> 23:28.557
It's finalized.

23:28.898 --> 23:30.081
I mean, you wouldn't have heard of them anyway.

23:30.101 --> 23:31.845
The company, you've never heard of them.

23:31.865 --> 23:34.210
The individuals, you would have heard of them.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.954
And you can't tell me off the record.

23:35.975 --> 23:38.380
No, no, I can't intuit finalized.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.643
I mean, I'd be happy to tell you

23:39.910 --> 23:40.852
who's comfortable with them.

23:40.892 --> 23:43.436
But I'm going to get back in touch with you.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.217
Yeah, it would be interesting.

23:44.237 --> 23:45.960
When it's all over one way or the other, will you tell me?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.262
Oh, yeah, of course you are.

23:47.342 --> 23:47.903
I mean, even if you don't.

23:47.923 --> 23:50.187
Listen, half the people in the East Coast think it happened already.

23:50.227 --> 23:51.328
I've had people put in it.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.530
Then why can't you tell me?

23:52.570 --> 23:56.316
Well, nobody knows the individual, because the individual is a corporation.

23:56.897 --> 24:00.042
It's not an individual or a company that you have ever heard of.

24:00.103 --> 24:00.363
Okay.

24:00.663 --> 24:05.091
I mean, it's a company that I couldn't find anything about, and I had to do a lot of work.

24:05.111 --> 24:05.952
Maybe I could find it.

24:06.455 --> 24:09.621
No, this is the... Couldn't find that.

24:09.641 --> 24:11.845
I found everything I wanted.

24:11.865 --> 24:13.428
This is part of the whole company.

24:13.448 --> 24:14.831
I'm going to shut this down.

24:14.891 --> 24:17.436
I think we really covered... Okay, I just turned it away.

24:17.516 --> 24:17.937
I'm sorry.

24:18.478 --> 24:20.502
I really don't think you did.

24:20.522 --> 24:22.465
I think you gave us some very good stuff.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.790
Did I miss anything, hon?

24:24.830 --> 24:25.932
Let me see if I... Oh, that's okay.

24:26.473 --> 24:26.573
Fine.
