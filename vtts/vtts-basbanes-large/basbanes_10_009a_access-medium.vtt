WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.884
So why don't we just start again?

00:03.904 --> 00:10.131
We're entering... Into a big fortifying tower.

00:10.151 --> 00:14.536
Just the walls are from the old Three Crowns castle.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.439
And it burned down in 1697.

00:17.459 --> 00:20.242
300 years ago.

00:20.422 --> 00:21.023
Exactly.

00:22.044 --> 00:22.725
This year.

00:22.805 --> 00:23.426
Exactly.

00:24.167 --> 00:24.587
Yes.

00:25.141 --> 00:28.485
Just pardon me, but would you pronounce your name for my tape?

00:28.505 --> 00:32.811
Yes, my name is Karula Sjögren de Hauke.

00:32.831 --> 00:35.214
Uh-huh, and I know how to spell it.

00:35.234 --> 00:37.977
No, you will get my card here.

00:38.678 --> 00:42.984
And I don't have a card with me, you'll have to forgive me.

00:43.004 --> 00:49.552
Yes, but I have read you in the Biblio.

00:49.572 --> 00:51.434
Did you see my book Gentle Madness?

00:52.055 --> 00:53.697
No, I haven't got that.

00:53.947 --> 00:59.835
They were supposed to mail you one from Biblio, but I will mail you one when I get back inscribed, okay?

01:00.015 --> 01:01.237
Oh, yes, with your name.

01:01.397 --> 01:03.780
I promise, and I say it with my tape on.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.381
Marvellous, marvellous.

01:04.401 --> 01:05.602
They're too heavy to carry.

01:05.823 --> 01:07.204
Yes, I can imagine.

01:07.264 --> 01:10.328
And you have been to Frankfurt, am I now?

01:10.589 --> 01:14.334
Yes, I already have, and I've been to St.

01:14.354 --> 01:16.697
Gallen to see the library there.

01:16.717 --> 01:18.099
Oh, I haven't been there myself.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.662
And I went to the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz.

01:21.343 --> 01:23.025
Oh, yes, there I have been.

01:23.208 --> 01:52.101
in the direction to the east exactly the same as we meet tomorrow at school cluster i think it's a renaissance ideal to place it in the eastern direction and of course it's eastern and southern direction the library the library within a castle or a palace it was always discussed how to place it

01:52.368 --> 01:53.309
What was the best?

01:53.850 --> 02:11.167
And certainly it's not to the north that we have noticed because now when we are going out to our summer palaces and visiting the libraries there, we see often this, you call it mold?

02:11.187 --> 02:11.768
Mold.

02:11.788 --> 02:12.829
Mold, yes.

02:12.849 --> 02:14.331
Or mildew perhaps?

02:14.531 --> 02:16.012
Yes, the green thing.

02:16.032 --> 02:16.232
Mold.

02:16.613 --> 02:17.214
Mold.

02:17.234 --> 02:17.734
Mold.

02:17.754 --> 02:17.874
Mold.

02:17.894 --> 02:19.095
Mildew is something else, yes.

02:19.616 --> 02:20.637
Yes, the mold.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.703
So it's not good.

02:22.803 --> 02:25.107
The books, they should have a little sunshine.

02:25.328 --> 02:27.251
Well, they discovered that very early, didn't they?

02:27.712 --> 02:28.634
Yes, they did.

02:28.894 --> 02:29.736
That's very interesting.

02:29.996 --> 02:32.581
This will be in my new book, by the way.

02:32.822 --> 02:33.523
Oh, lovely.

02:35.226 --> 02:36.208
Because I'm writing a book.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.157
I'll tell you later when I have the... Where can I get rid of this...

02:41.272 --> 02:46.438
I'm going to leave my cane some place too.

02:47.439 --> 02:51.984
Because I want to take notes and I can't take notes with the cane.

02:52.004 --> 02:59.792
No, we can sit down and I will tell you I have English copies for you about this library.

02:59.953 --> 03:00.413
Oh, good.

03:00.493 --> 03:04.177
So you can also relax and enjoy yourself, I hope.

03:04.197 --> 03:05.619
I'm already enjoying myself.

03:05.899 --> 03:07.761
Good.

03:07.781 --> 03:09.523
Now, I will

03:09.925 --> 03:13.689
Now we are going into the north-eastern wing.

03:13.709 --> 03:17.533
Ah, my goodness.

03:17.553 --> 03:22.779
Oh, my goodness.

03:22.799 --> 03:24.821
Oh, my goodness.

03:24.841 --> 03:25.462
Yes.

03:25.482 --> 03:27.384
I love to hear that from you.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.848
I feel the same, you know.

03:32.150 --> 03:37.215
After 18 years here, I feel the same coming into.

03:37.435 --> 03:38.937
It's like a cathedral.

03:39.743 --> 03:41.445
Ah, it's lovely.

03:42.747 --> 03:51.859
Now this, tell me a little bit about the history of this, not the history, so we'll get to that, but is this the personal library of His Majesty?

03:52.119 --> 03:55.204
Yes, it's his private library.

03:55.885 --> 04:04.536
It is, but his private books, what he gets today, that's in his palace

04:05.123 --> 04:10.971
or here in his private apartment in the palace.

04:11.271 --> 04:20.283
So these books, they belong actually to kings and queens, prince and princesses who have died.

04:20.824 --> 04:22.346
They don't live anymore.

04:23.006 --> 04:27.933
It's like a book museum of the Bernadotte dynasty.

04:29.074 --> 04:34.962
So it's the largest collection, private collection,

04:35.431 --> 04:41.878
of the 19th and 20th books in here.

04:42.919 --> 04:45.402
About 100,000 volumes.

04:45.642 --> 04:47.124
In this room that we're in now?

04:47.384 --> 04:49.266
We are not in this room.

04:49.726 --> 04:58.476
But you see, behind me, to the north, there are... ...the opera house.

04:58.496 --> 05:01.439
And there we have the rest of the books.

05:01.639 --> 05:05.083
Beautiful bindings and...

05:05.333 --> 05:34.716
well not the show pieces are behind now you said 19th and 20th so these are all fairly recent books then yes they are we are not famous for be having fantastic old books that you will visit tomorrow this is something different but we have books from of course the 18th century and even the 16th century give

05:35.320 --> 05:59.252
air given to the lower person now you said that's facing east no that's facing south south but actually the wing is a north southern eastern wing because this palace has four wings i'm just pardon me i'm

05:59.772 --> 06:05.539
This is running, by the way, so it'll just play in there.

06:06.060 --> 06:09.084
But I just want to pause and look at some of these.

06:09.104 --> 06:14.091
Now, what's the scheme of the holiday shelves?

06:16.654 --> 06:21.460
Yes, how it is placed today is important to the provenance.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.805
you can go to the bookshelf and see.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.989
What you actually are looking now is Oscar II.

06:29.670 --> 06:41.322
But if we start with the first Bernadotte, you have Carl Johan XIV, and he came to Sweden in 1810.

06:41.783 --> 06:45.147
And we have just a little of his books there.

06:45.367 --> 06:49.371
The rest is in a little palace, Rosendal.

06:49.942 --> 06:50.903
in Stockholm.

06:51.143 --> 06:52.485
Did he start the library?

06:53.266 --> 06:53.726
No.

06:54.828 --> 07:00.995
This idea to put all the Bernadotte books here was Oscar II.

07:01.195 --> 07:03.458
He was a bibliophile actually.

07:04.920 --> 07:17.855
And before these books, they were placed in the private apartments here in the huge palace, over 900 rooms.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.577
So each person

07:19.827 --> 07:22.351
had a private little apartment.

07:22.371 --> 07:28.820
The king his apartment, the queen her apartment, the prince and prince's size.

07:30.522 --> 07:33.146
I would say about, what, 100 feet at least?

07:33.166 --> 07:38.273
Yes, you translate it to 37 meters.

07:38.794 --> 07:41.437
Okay, so it's 37 meters.

07:43.380 --> 07:49.108
And if we start, if we just start with the history of this film,

07:49.696 --> 08:03.044
Because the Golden Church in 1796 was inaugurated in 1796.

08:03.164 --> 08:07.674
201 years ago this was finally completed.

08:07.694 --> 08:10.219
It was the last room in the palace.

08:10.688 --> 08:38.468
that was so late because the royal family after the fire they moved into the palace here in in the middle of the 18th century and why it was so late it was because here the carpenters stood on this huge floor carving all the beautiful decorations

08:38.667 --> 08:39.848
to the rest of the palace.

08:40.048 --> 08:40.829
What kind of wood?

08:41.509 --> 08:43.811
It's oak.

08:43.831 --> 08:45.273
Swedish oak?

08:45.573 --> 08:49.356
Yes, we have a lot of oak, yes.

08:49.376 --> 08:53.780
We have a lot of oak, and then the floor is probably... It's in pine, pine trees.

08:55.601 --> 09:00.025
What's magnificent about it, it's not ornate.

09:00.185 --> 09:01.686
It's tasteful, it's beautiful.

09:01.746 --> 09:03.588
Yes, it is.

09:03.608 --> 09:08.472
Well, you who have been around quite a lot, you can't compare, I understand.

09:09.059 --> 09:15.507
And it's, what we say, it's built so slowly because of, well, we were poor.

09:15.547 --> 09:20.774
Sweden was poor after all the wars in the beginning of the 18th century.

09:21.956 --> 09:31.007
So we couldn't afford to paint the ceiling in beautiful baroque, you know, we couldn't afford that.

09:31.027 --> 09:37.075
We could not afford to paint this library in white and brown.

09:37.527 --> 09:43.775
was the intention of the architect to see Nicodemus.

09:44.196 --> 09:45.878
And that'll be in the material?

09:46.158 --> 09:47.700
Yes, it will.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.604
Don't mind.

09:50.624 --> 09:58.014
And you know, Charles XII and his disastrous wars were in Russia.

09:59.135 --> 10:06.125
The money was just finished and they couldn't afford that.

10:06.145 --> 10:07.146
And we are very happy.

10:07.497 --> 10:08.158
It's beautiful.

10:08.598 --> 10:09.880
It's much more beautiful.

10:10.180 --> 10:11.301
Personally, I prefer.

10:11.722 --> 10:14.124
It gives a warmth, this room.

10:14.204 --> 10:18.429
Though it's so huge, you have the warmth of it.

10:18.449 --> 10:22.073
It is inviting, and yet it is awesome at the same time.

10:22.093 --> 10:22.914
Yes.

10:22.934 --> 10:25.557
And what do you call that gallery up there?

10:25.577 --> 10:27.439
We call it the balcony.

10:27.559 --> 10:28.120
A balcony.

10:28.140 --> 10:34.266
You have to have a difference of a very narrow room behind here.

10:34.286 --> 10:36.449
And I will show you along.

10:36.469 --> 10:36.829
Thank you.

10:36.995 --> 10:38.537
If you want to, we can go after it.

10:38.557 --> 10:39.698
Oh, I'd like everything.

10:40.178 --> 10:41.780
Tell me a little bit about the chandeliers.

10:42.901 --> 10:46.665
They are from the middle of the 19th century.

10:47.166 --> 10:54.574
And they were actually placed somewhere elsewhere in a fantastic banquet room.

10:55.495 --> 11:06.006
And why it is so, why they are not from this time, from the end of the 18th century, it's because this

11:06.222 --> 11:11.708
when it's ready, 1796, it moves in.

11:11.728 --> 11:13.870
The National Library.

11:13.890 --> 11:19.716
This is the cradle of our medieval National Library.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.137
How so?

11:22.359 --> 11:30.627
Yes, because when the old Three Crowns burnt down, it was by a law in

11:30.944 --> 11:40.558
In 1961, that everything that was published in Sweden should come to the castle to be controlled.

11:40.978 --> 11:45.385
The Swedes have always controlled what the printers had.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.065
Really?

11:46.346 --> 11:47.648
Yes, not the authors.

11:47.668 --> 11:48.609
Censorship, you mean?

11:48.749 --> 11:49.070
Yes.

11:49.771 --> 11:50.372
Very strict.

11:50.552 --> 11:51.914
Very strict.

11:54.778 --> 11:57.221
We have always been under that eye.

11:57.402 --> 11:58.063
Not now, though.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.304
No, no, no.

11:59.324 --> 12:00.546
Now it's just opposite.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.807
But I tried to nugget.

12:06.109 --> 12:13.559
Now, so you see, it was in the palace the books should come to be assembled.

12:13.879 --> 12:15.141
And to be looked at first.

12:15.982 --> 12:17.364
Yes, to be looked at.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.186
To be examined even, perhaps.

12:19.366 --> 12:24.613
Of course, very carefully examined, before it was put on the shelf.

12:25.575 --> 12:29.740
So in 1877, this library was

12:29.973 --> 12:32.235
crowded by books.

12:32.255 --> 12:33.757
And it moved into a new view.

12:33.777 --> 12:36.280
This library, this room that we're in.

12:36.660 --> 12:38.522
This was the National Library.

12:38.582 --> 12:39.143
Yes, it was.

12:39.643 --> 12:42.506
It was the National Library till 1877.

12:42.847 --> 12:43.788
I see.

12:44.208 --> 12:48.533
From 796.

12:49.934 --> 12:54.259
You see, we have a castle first, which burns down.

12:54.279 --> 12:58.183
And after a hundred years, we get a palace.

12:58.203 --> 12:58.343
Mm-hmm.

12:59.352 --> 13:00.854
And how old is this room here?

13:00.874 --> 13:07.984
This room is started in the beginning of the 18th century to be built.

13:08.705 --> 13:14.573
But as I mentioned to you, it was the last room to be completed in the palace.

13:14.713 --> 13:15.534
Excellent.

13:15.554 --> 13:18.378
Because they worked here.

13:18.398 --> 13:18.819
Wonderful.

13:19.479 --> 13:28.752
And we have a very famous author who started his career, writing career here at the National Library.

13:29.457 --> 13:32.480
A librarian, August Strindberg.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.022
Oh, sounds right.

13:34.282 --> 13:36.525
I read him in college, of course.

13:36.545 --> 13:36.865
Yes.

13:37.005 --> 13:41.870
Yes, August Strindberg is a great dramatist.

13:42.231 --> 13:45.774
Yes, of course, and novelist and all things, you know.

13:45.794 --> 13:46.535
But he worked in here?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.697
He worked in here.

13:48.757 --> 13:48.918
Where?

13:48.958 --> 13:49.698
Where did he work?

13:49.959 --> 13:50.840
Do you know?

13:50.860 --> 13:53.963
All around, here in the galleries.

13:54.382 --> 13:56.224
This is where he did his research?

13:56.244 --> 13:57.485
He came here to read?

13:57.525 --> 13:58.986
Did he write here?

13:59.107 --> 14:01.909
No, he came here to work to get his family.

14:01.929 --> 14:07.014
That was the only occupation, but he was not... Oh, he worked literally, is what you mean.

14:07.034 --> 14:07.635
Yes, as a librarian.

14:07.655 --> 14:09.316
I thought you meant he worked as a writer.

14:09.797 --> 14:22.549
No, he worked as a librarian, hiring books, put them into the shelves, and while he worked here, I say, of course, he had his

14:23.238 --> 14:32.331
ideal writing books before he came here, I'm sure.

14:32.932 --> 14:34.835
Can you think of any things in particular?

14:34.855 --> 14:48.294
By the way, for my new book, I am writing about, and I didn't know about Stenberg, about authors who were librarians, like Borges, like Greta, like Lessing, like Archibald MacLeish.

14:48.995 --> 14:49.836
I can name you

14:50.457 --> 14:58.307
Quite a few who have had, Wallace Stevens, our poet, have all had experience.

14:58.427 --> 15:05.436
And knew where to fetch interesting sources, where to go and find it.

15:05.897 --> 15:09.682
Was he trained as a librarian or was this just as a job that he was able to get?

15:09.702 --> 15:10.603
No, he was an extra.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.527
He was not in the staff.

15:13.767 --> 15:14.929
He was just extra.

15:15.329 --> 15:18.253
But he worked for about...

15:18.706 --> 15:19.888
three, four years.

15:20.028 --> 15:20.609
That's a long time.

15:20.929 --> 15:21.130
Yes.

15:21.690 --> 15:29.382
And he moved with the National Library to the new building in Hummelgården.

15:29.402 --> 15:31.665
You'll have it on campus later.

15:31.685 --> 15:33.949
So, and he was... I'm just taking a few notes.

15:34.009 --> 15:34.610
The piano.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.112
Do you have receptions in here?

15:36.192 --> 15:37.013
Yes, we have.

15:37.093 --> 15:38.656
The king has receptions.

15:41.380 --> 15:45.085
This king is a bibliophile, too, I understand.

15:45.105 --> 15:48.190
I don't know, I will say.

15:48.372 --> 15:51.255
because we don't handle his books.

15:51.595 --> 15:58.401
Because he brings them with him to Drötenholm and puts them also in his private apartment here.

15:58.521 --> 16:04.547
Well, he did address a conference of the International League of Israel Files.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.908
Yes, in 1984 here.

16:06.328 --> 16:07.209
That's right.

16:08.630 --> 16:12.454
And I am told by people that he is quite... He's interested.

16:12.694 --> 16:14.015
Yes, he's quite a bookman.

16:14.275 --> 16:16.017
Yes, and he is...

16:16.452 --> 16:18.954
very proud of his library.

16:19.535 --> 16:22.257
So he has a library apart from this?

16:22.958 --> 16:23.278
Apart from this.

16:23.939 --> 16:31.986
And I hope in my generation, I won't see his books here, because, you know, that means that the king is dead.

16:33.488 --> 16:35.129
They are not going into here.

16:35.730 --> 16:39.994
Because as soon as the books are placed here, he can never take them out.

16:40.014 --> 16:42.556
He can come here and borrow books.

16:43.097 --> 16:44.098
From his predecessors?

16:44.118 --> 16:44.518
Yes.

16:45.207 --> 16:51.273
and borrower to read them in his own chair at Rottenhorn.

16:51.614 --> 16:56.198
But he cannot take some books and say, oh, I need some credit.

16:56.559 --> 16:57.059
No, no, no.

16:57.420 --> 17:08.311
So it's different foundations in a way and societies that guarantee that nothing is taken away from this library.

17:08.651 --> 17:14.978
And this policy was established by whom?

17:15.110 --> 17:17.573
It was established by... It's a tradition, I guess.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.898
Yes, it started actually by Oscar II.

17:20.918 --> 17:22.760
And he was the bibliophile king?

17:22.821 --> 17:33.996
Yes, he was indeed, because you can see he covers nearly the whole northern side room and also in the galleries.

17:34.156 --> 17:36.439
So these are all Oscar II books?

17:36.459 --> 17:38.502
Yes, and he was a poet.

17:38.802 --> 17:53.336
because he got the second prize reward from the Swedish Academy for his poetry and you always put it in anonymously.

17:53.356 --> 17:54.017
You call it so?

17:54.317 --> 17:55.258
Anonymously, yes.

17:55.318 --> 17:57.681
Yes, yes.

17:57.701 --> 18:04.928
And after he got this little second prize with a smaller gold medal

18:05.515 --> 18:08.518
He was so happy.

18:08.879 --> 18:15.186
So he wrote poems and travel essays and speeches.

18:15.627 --> 18:21.493
And that just got him going, actually, as an author.

18:21.754 --> 18:22.074
Really?

18:22.134 --> 18:26.379
And did he still publish anonymously or did he now publish it with his own name?

18:26.399 --> 18:26.499
No.

18:26.799 --> 18:29.903
With his name, Oskar Fredrik.

18:30.187 --> 18:31.789
Oscar Frederick.

18:31.809 --> 18:33.611
What were his years approximately?

18:33.771 --> 18:42.402
It starts, he is born around 1828-29 and he dies in 1907.

18:44.205 --> 18:46.327
So his reign was about when?

18:46.347 --> 18:55.138
It started first 1872 because he was the third son of his father.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.202
So the first son, of course,

18:58.435 --> 19:06.327
became a king, and he died, and the second son had died before in TBC.

19:07.209 --> 19:08.190
TBC is what?

19:08.952 --> 19:10.474
That is with the lungs.

19:11.015 --> 19:12.337
Oh, tuberculosis.

19:12.357 --> 19:15.822
Yes, tuberculosis.

19:15.843 --> 19:26.299
And then he... He was the third, and he never planned to become a king, so he planned to write and be a writer and a poet.

19:26.684 --> 19:30.029
So when he won this medal, it was before he was king?

19:30.049 --> 19:42.950
Yes, it was in 1857 he got it from the Swedish Academy, which yesterday elected Dario Fo, the Literature Prize.

19:43.911 --> 19:49.961
Dario Fo, the Italian, the absurd theatre writer.

19:50.722 --> 19:51.643
Dario Fo.

19:51.663 --> 19:52.425
Oh yes, okay.

19:52.485 --> 19:53.546
I haven't seen a newspaper.

19:53.707 --> 19:54.548
No, no, no.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.934
If you want to sit down, you can sit down.

19:56.954 --> 19:58.276
No, no, no, this is fine, this is fine.

19:58.776 --> 20:04.142
And so, Oscar's books are one, two, three... What do you call these areas?

20:05.644 --> 20:09.629
Well, you put a name in English for it.

20:09.649 --> 20:15.796
I don't know what your... They are sections, exactly.

20:17.338 --> 20:22.664
But so, King Oscar has one, two, three, four, you think four or five sections?

20:23.365 --> 20:23.505
Four...

20:23.654 --> 20:29.326
Two, four, six, seven here and a lot.

20:29.346 --> 20:30.489
He had seven here?

20:30.509 --> 20:31.571
Yes, seven here.

20:31.591 --> 20:34.157
So how many books do you think he contributed to the library?

20:34.838 --> 20:37.725
Oh, it's tough for me to measure.

20:37.745 --> 20:43.317
But he has the major part of 100,000 volumes.

20:43.735 --> 20:48.080
Of 100,000 volumes, he is the principal contributor.

20:48.521 --> 20:50.663
Yes, I would say so.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.225
In this library.

20:52.245 --> 20:56.731
But then we have another king, Gustav Adolf VI.

20:59.494 --> 21:08.905
His library, his private library, is still in his private flat in the northwestern wing.

21:09.406 --> 21:11.228
And I thought Antoinette.

21:11.697 --> 21:18.464
who looks after that collection of art books and artcology might show you.

21:18.484 --> 21:19.985
Oh good, excellent.

21:20.006 --> 21:22.168
So how come those books aren't part of this library?

21:22.388 --> 21:23.769
Because there is no room.

21:24.350 --> 21:29.956
But are they still technically part of the... Yes, it's in the Bernadotte Library.

21:29.976 --> 21:30.256
I see.

21:30.276 --> 21:32.038
But they're just housed in another place.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.700
Yes, because there is no place.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.440
There's no place.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.102
And the king today says,

21:36.588 --> 21:38.070
Where shall my books be?

21:40.052 --> 21:44.597
He has private flats, so it's no problem.

21:44.698 --> 21:47.261
Just as a... So does anybody use these books?

21:47.281 --> 21:47.981
Do you have readers?

21:48.462 --> 22:03.760
Yes, we have researchers, we have authors coming here, and specialize perhaps in French history, because the first Bernadotte King, Carl Jung on the 40th,

22:04.702 --> 22:08.847
He was indeed very interested in French history.

22:08.867 --> 22:11.391
How would you characterize the titles?

22:11.411 --> 22:13.493
Are they eclectic, would you say?

22:13.934 --> 22:15.115
What does that mean?

22:15.136 --> 22:19.962
I mean a lot of different things, a lot of different areas, or is it focused?

22:19.982 --> 22:20.302
Yes.

22:21.243 --> 22:28.773
On the first one, Dr. King, it's focused most on his interests, of course.

22:30.275 --> 22:32.498
What do you call it when you...

22:33.085 --> 22:35.368
you value your speech rhetoric.

22:36.449 --> 22:42.537
He was a very keen man of how to speak, and he spoke in French.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.780
He never learned Swedish.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.381
Really?

22:45.401 --> 22:52.170
Yes, and he wrote books about how to hold speeches to get the masses with you.

22:52.190 --> 22:54.493
He didn't speak Swedish and he was the king of Sweden?

22:54.513 --> 22:58.738
No, yes, because all the people around him knew French.

22:59.191 --> 23:00.252
You spoke French.

23:00.693 --> 23:08.862
In the upper classes those days, in the beginning of the 19th century, you had French as you had English.

23:09.843 --> 23:18.613
And his queen, Desiree, a rich merchant girl from Marseille, she didn't speak Swedish either.

23:18.633 --> 23:18.954
French.

23:19.694 --> 23:20.035
French.

23:20.155 --> 23:24.039
And what are these big, these large... Books here, there are books.

23:24.059 --> 23:24.540
Yes.

23:24.605 --> 23:27.568
Yes, they are quite interesting, so I will show you.

23:27.608 --> 23:29.210
You don't mind my asking different questions?

23:29.270 --> 23:30.551
No, go right ahead.

23:30.571 --> 23:43.465
It's a fantastic gift to one of our kings from the town of Paris on his first state visit to Paris in 1908.

23:43.965 --> 23:48.250
It's a gift from the city of Paris.

23:48.567 --> 23:55.133
And we have the John Blau Atlas, like of course, you know, the Dutch edition.

23:55.153 --> 23:55.893
It's famous.

23:57.875 --> 24:01.198
And I will touch my gloves.

24:01.218 --> 24:03.580
And you sit down and I will show you.

24:03.600 --> 24:03.780
Okay.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.923
You're telling me... Here, the Red Book from Paris.

24:07.584 --> 24:11.427
It's about the coronation of Napoleon.

24:11.547 --> 24:14.930
And I will open it for you and show you.

24:15.150 --> 24:18.253
And I will leave my pen over here, so don't worry.

24:18.773 --> 24:19.754
I'm very careful.

24:20.095 --> 24:22.278
Yes, of course.

24:22.298 --> 24:22.939
You can imagine.

24:23.820 --> 24:29.988
And now, two years ago, the king and queen was here.

24:30.008 --> 24:30.148
Mm-hmm.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.191
Opening this blau atlas.

24:32.992 --> 24:34.194
Is this a picture we can use?

24:34.575 --> 24:37.318
Yes, if you get in contact with him.

24:37.719 --> 24:38.340
Okay.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.561
Charles Hammer's there.

24:40.022 --> 24:42.265
He is a photographer.

24:42.285 --> 24:43.266
And that's his phone number.

24:43.467 --> 24:44.248
That's his phone number.

24:44.268 --> 24:45.229
Biblia will do all of this.

24:45.710 --> 24:47.332
Yes, and you borrow that.

24:47.412 --> 24:47.652
Yes.

24:47.793 --> 24:48.173
Please?

24:48.305 --> 24:59.440
And book plates, Oscar II, over the depth towards, well, the sky, the height.

24:59.460 --> 25:00.781
That's how that translates?

25:00.841 --> 25:02.003
Yes, more or less.

25:02.043 --> 25:05.247
Could you just say it for me how it sounds in Swedish?

25:05.307 --> 25:05.728
Yes.

25:05.748 --> 25:06.569
And then translate it.

25:06.609 --> 25:06.989
Yes.

25:07.650 --> 25:10.714
Over djupen mot höjden.

25:12.397 --> 25:17.383
Over means over the djupen depth, the deep.

25:17.482 --> 25:24.612
And towards the height, the sky, upwards.

25:26.274 --> 25:32.703
And it's more or less a theosophic, religious thinking about it.

25:34.426 --> 25:34.846
Interesting.

25:34.907 --> 25:35.808
And this was his.

25:35.828 --> 25:36.949
Did he pick that himself?

25:37.190 --> 25:37.590
Yes, he did.

25:38.472 --> 25:44.300
And he had an architect who drawed this.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.902
O-S-K-A-R?

25:46.169 --> 25:49.193
O-S-C is more beautiful.

25:49.253 --> 25:59.545
As soon as they die, it's transmitted into a K, but when they leave, they spell it with C. Really?

25:59.565 --> 26:00.366
I wonder why that is.

26:00.666 --> 26:01.026
Yes.

26:02.188 --> 26:04.771
Stupid tradition.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.233
I don't agree with it.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.615
And here's our Queen Victoria.

26:09.837 --> 26:11.319
We will talk about her, perhaps.

26:11.459 --> 26:12.039
We will see.

26:12.079 --> 26:16.024
And here is Gustav Adolf VI.

26:16.898 --> 26:28.875
that says in Latin that nothing you... Well, I shall not try to translate it now, but we have it in the papers I have.

26:29.136 --> 26:29.356
Oh, good.

26:29.376 --> 26:31.219
So I'll be able to determine who these are.

26:31.239 --> 26:37.969
Yes, because about Gustav Adolf's library, I will let Antoinette Ramsey talk about it.

26:39.711 --> 26:44.458
As she has his library, I have the photo collections,

26:44.506 --> 26:48.171
about half a million photos.

26:48.191 --> 26:51.997
And here's one, the coronation of the Tsar in 1896.

26:52.177 --> 26:56.904
And who took these photographs?

26:57.124 --> 26:59.848
It was a Russian photograph.

27:00.649 --> 27:02.812
And how did they enter the collection?

27:03.353 --> 27:11.745
Because our crown prince was there, invited to the coronation, and he brought with him a box.

27:12.721 --> 27:22.317
filled with photos of this, and menus and everything, you know, and it's quite interesting.

27:23.018 --> 27:25.342
What is the official designation?

27:25.502 --> 27:28.487
It's right there, right?

27:28.688 --> 27:33.856
How would you refer to this, to the king and the queen, officially in the caption to a photograph?

27:34.738 --> 27:35.639
To make sure it's correct.

27:35.659 --> 27:38.644
It was actually for...

27:38.708 --> 27:39.730
I mean, how would you write it?

27:40.492 --> 27:45.282
What would be the appropriate way to write it?

27:45.302 --> 27:47.085
His Royal Majesty.

27:48.148 --> 27:49.851
No, His Majesty the King.

27:50.132 --> 27:51.154
His Majesty the King.

27:52.276 --> 27:53.439
His Majesty the King.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.703
And then you have a comma, and then his name.

27:56.044 --> 27:56.565
Yes.

27:57.052 --> 28:01.898
Well, Carl Gustav, the 16th.

28:02.019 --> 28:08.968
Carl with C. The 16th in... XVI.

28:09.629 --> 28:10.209
Exactly.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.012
Gustav.

28:12.032 --> 28:17.399
J-U... That's J. G, right?

28:17.439 --> 28:18.941
G. G-U-S-T-A-V.

28:18.961 --> 28:19.782
Just like that.

28:19.802 --> 28:23.447
Yes, and the 16th shall come in between.

28:25.081 --> 28:32.312
And Gustav shall be with an F. It's not the way we do it in the... No.

28:32.933 --> 28:35.717
But no, you will have it the Swedish way.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.939
Absolutely.

28:36.959 --> 28:37.800
Yes.

28:37.901 --> 28:39.182
And then you say, and his wife.

28:40.164 --> 28:40.625
Yes.

28:40.645 --> 28:41.426
And his wife.

28:43.729 --> 28:46.393
Her Majesty the Queen Sylvia.

28:47.555 --> 28:48.136
Pretty name.

28:49.238 --> 28:50.339
Her Majesty the Queen.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.003
S-Y.

28:53.805 --> 28:54.025
L.

28:54.173 --> 28:55.154
V-I-A.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.456
Examine.

28:57.677 --> 29:00.580
No, E, it's E, not Y, S-E.

29:01.341 --> 29:03.142
Oh, I, I, S-I.

29:04.324 --> 29:08.568
No, A. No, I'm sorry.

29:09.609 --> 29:14.614
I'd like to make sure we have everything right.

29:17.918 --> 29:21.742
And here they are in the library, and this is the book over here.

29:21.802 --> 29:22.763
Exactly.

29:23.182 --> 29:24.924
And you were going to open it for me.

29:24.944 --> 29:28.249
Yes, certainly.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.452
And the formal title of this book is?

29:32.635 --> 29:35.359
Wait, I can give that to you.

29:35.399 --> 29:38.243
I will write it down.

29:38.383 --> 29:42.449
Oh, no, no, no.

29:42.569 --> 29:45.894
This here in the... Strindberg is?

29:45.934 --> 29:47.576
Yes, in the Royal Library.

29:47.676 --> 29:48.818
When he leaves it,

29:49.895 --> 29:58.363
here for going to the new library building, he says in the Madman's Manifesto.

29:59.624 --> 30:00.765
I'll use this in my story.

30:01.446 --> 30:01.686
Yes.

30:01.706 --> 30:03.668
The Madman's Manifesto.

30:04.289 --> 30:05.249
You get that book.

30:07.071 --> 30:16.560
A Madman's Manifesto, which he wrote actually when he was abroad, when he had left

30:17.131 --> 30:22.957
in this library, thinking about his time as a librarian here.

30:22.977 --> 30:23.978
So these are his memoirs?

30:25.279 --> 30:31.746
All the writings are actually kind of memoirs, in a way.

30:33.268 --> 30:37.252
I'm sorry I interrupted, but he was writing about his days here?

30:37.692 --> 30:39.594
Yes, he mentioned it in this.

30:40.635 --> 30:43.358
A madman's manifesto about his marriage too.

30:44.367 --> 30:50.935
And he starts with a book, he says, this is an awful book I'm writing.

30:51.636 --> 30:52.336
He says this.

30:52.356 --> 30:53.378
He says this.

30:53.878 --> 30:54.659
He knows it.

30:55.040 --> 31:04.531
He wants to get the public in a uproar, and he wants that effect on the reader.

31:05.852 --> 31:07.955
He wants to anger, excite, I guess.

31:07.975 --> 31:09.437
Yeah, yeah.

31:10.498 --> 31:11.820
This is very interesting to me.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.041
Mm.

31:13.713 --> 31:15.415
That kind of stuff I'm gathering.

31:15.435 --> 31:20.741
See, I'm not just writing about libraries, I'm also writing about book people, people who are influenced by their books.

31:22.263 --> 31:24.746
Yes, I'm sorry.

31:24.866 --> 31:25.427
Go ahead.

31:25.587 --> 31:29.452
So this sounds like it's exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for.

31:29.993 --> 31:39.484
Yes, and you will find it probably translated into English about Strindberg, and if you don't, I will find some books for you to read.

31:39.970 --> 31:43.176
Not me only talking about it.

31:43.196 --> 31:43.737
Okay, good.

31:43.757 --> 31:44.057
Yes.

31:44.999 --> 31:49.607
And this is Jom Blau Atlas, the Dutch.

31:50.248 --> 31:53.654
Oh, sorry.

31:53.674 --> 31:54.055
Oh, no.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.858
I have to have the ink.

31:57.701 --> 32:00.566
This is this plastic thing.

32:00.586 --> 32:00.847
Try this.

32:00.867 --> 32:03.171
This is a... That might be better.

32:03.191 --> 32:04.493
Oh, thank you very much.

32:11.645 --> 32:16.512
11 or... So this was a nine... So you have the other volumes here in the library?

32:16.572 --> 32:26.987
No, we just have this volume and it's from Scandinavia and Russia, Poland and Svalbard, the north.

32:27.969 --> 32:32.936
And it's a gift to the king.

32:34.077 --> 32:34.859
To this king?

32:34.879 --> 32:36.000
No, not this king.

32:36.020 --> 32:40.707
To our late king, Gustav Adolf VI.

32:42.205 --> 32:48.654
So it's, well, he has not bought it himself.

32:48.674 --> 32:49.635
Excellent, thank you.

32:49.675 --> 32:55.643
And now, you have seen this atlas before.

32:55.663 --> 32:57.065
I have, yes, I think I have.

32:57.245 --> 32:58.707
Yes, so now you can compare.

32:58.727 --> 32:59.628
This is for Dutch.

33:00.650 --> 33:04.895
Well, I don't know if it's a little much.

33:05.717 --> 33:11.184
Now, so whatever has been chewing on the pages, yes.

33:11.204 --> 33:11.284
Hmm.

33:13.036 --> 33:16.400
And here you have a medium black.

33:16.420 --> 33:21.287
And it's also from the Pico Brauer's eyeliner.

33:21.387 --> 33:22.849
It's quite beautiful.

33:22.869 --> 33:25.392
Yes.

33:25.412 --> 33:30.039
The paper is... It's lovely.

33:30.059 --> 33:30.820
Oh, look at that.

33:31.120 --> 33:31.681
Look at this.

33:33.423 --> 33:33.844
Can you see?

33:33.864 --> 33:34.364
Oh, look at that.

33:34.384 --> 33:36.227
How old is that MDC?

33:36.327 --> 33:38.450
That is 1600.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.472
That's L is 50.

33:41.374 --> 33:42.435
X10 is

33:42.618 --> 33:45.481
very well, and 1664.

33:48.684 --> 33:50.006
And here you have the spelling.

33:50.947 --> 33:51.327
P.L.

33:52.068 --> 33:53.389
Did I... No, no, that's fine.

33:53.409 --> 33:57.193
I just want to take a picture of it while you're holding it.

33:57.213 --> 33:57.413
Yes.

33:57.433 --> 33:59.175
Good, you can just continue talking.

33:59.195 --> 34:02.258
I'm just... And here you have the Dutch title.

34:02.638 --> 34:07.123
Erste Spicht der Grigstisch Reading.

34:08.369 --> 34:12.795
And the first edition was in Latin, Atlas Major.

34:14.016 --> 34:24.670
And then I think the French tape, the Dutch, and the Spanish.

34:25.971 --> 34:28.094
The camera's rewinding now.

34:28.114 --> 34:29.716
Yes, I have the same.

34:30.056 --> 34:31.418
This is my daughter's camera.

34:32.079 --> 34:35.203
And I borrow my son's camera.

34:35.420 --> 34:38.043
Oh, really?

34:38.063 --> 34:39.104
Oh, absolutely.

34:39.204 --> 34:42.147
It's hard to... don't go away now.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.969
And here you have the Spitzberg.

34:44.009 --> 34:51.777
I like your hand in there, actually, when you're pointing, so it's, uh... The Spitzberg.

34:51.817 --> 34:54.680
Is it okay there?

34:54.700 --> 34:55.761
It just has to recycle.

34:55.781 --> 34:58.043
This is... I keep forgetting this is not a professional camera.

34:58.644 --> 35:02.668
No, no, you're just... I am sorry.

35:02.688 --> 35:03.288
There it is.

35:03.308 --> 35:04.009
Okay, good.

35:04.495 --> 35:08.901
And you see the beautiful, we call it cartouche on the map.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.844
It's so beautifully painted.

35:11.144 --> 35:15.590
And the strong colors, you won't see that at Skokloster.

35:16.111 --> 35:18.174
It's the green, look at the green.

35:18.514 --> 35:22.260
I can't, looking at it from this angle, look at the gold there.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.521
Yes, the gold.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.025
This looks like it could have been done yesterday.

35:26.165 --> 35:26.466
Yes.

35:26.526 --> 35:27.647
That's how magnificent it is.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.408
Yes, it is.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.853
But you see, very few people have been looking at it.

35:32.018 --> 35:32.859
Well, that's important.

35:32.879 --> 35:34.462
That's why books are little museums.

35:34.862 --> 35:35.283
Yes.

35:35.303 --> 35:41.092
That when you consider the whole of their lives, they're just exposed for a fraction of a time.

35:41.733 --> 35:42.774
Exactly.

35:42.814 --> 35:46.259
Look at that.

35:46.279 --> 35:47.581
By the way, those aspirins are good.

35:48.062 --> 35:48.443
Thank you.

35:48.463 --> 35:49.444
Oh, I'm happy.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.707
They have worked now.

35:52.509 --> 36:01.202
And I will put on the... Do you have a look here?

36:01.222 --> 36:01.502
Oh.

36:03.018 --> 36:04.560
Where are we now?

36:04.940 --> 36:08.404
John's here.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.642
Magnificent.

36:23.662 --> 36:28.908
We just took a photograph of Insula 2.

36:29.368 --> 36:30.790
I don't know what it is.

36:30.810 --> 36:31.911
It's a beautiful picture, Nick.

36:32.498 --> 36:38.591
It looks like an island with a yellow area on the lower right.

36:38.611 --> 36:41.378
Without... You know, it's very interesting.

36:41.999 --> 36:45.447
I wonder if something was supposed to have been written in there at some point.

36:45.467 --> 36:46.709
Of course.

36:46.729 --> 36:47.972
But they didn't have a time.

36:47.992 --> 36:50.317
It was to be delivered quickly.

36:50.778 --> 36:52.482
So you will meet that...

36:52.833 --> 36:53.714
That area?

36:53.734 --> 36:55.476
Yes, that area several times.

36:55.816 --> 36:59.220
Spitsbergen, which I pointed out on that map.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.501
Oh, look at these areas.

37:00.521 --> 37:02.163
See, this is all terra incognita.

37:02.543 --> 37:04.385
Yes, Spitsbergen.

37:04.665 --> 37:07.689
It's called in Dutch.

37:07.709 --> 37:11.292
And Nova Sermla, and you will find something there.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.333
These are exquisite.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.135
Exquisite.

37:14.155 --> 37:14.255
Look.

37:15.537 --> 37:16.378
Isn't it pretty?

37:16.398 --> 37:18.280
I've got to take that from my little girl who loves animals.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.482
Oh, it's so pretty.

37:21.263 --> 37:22.384
And here you have...

37:22.837 --> 37:48.372
a dutch ship i suppose yes with a dutch flag and look at the different sun constellations i think it's a beautiful and so it goes everyone is more exciting than the last yes because the strong colors and there were nine

37:49.077 --> 37:52.722
Nine volumes in the Dutch tradition.

37:52.742 --> 37:55.526
And they all had... Yes, they all had this.

37:57.990 --> 38:01.354
But not with these very same kinds of paintings, though.

38:01.374 --> 38:06.542
No, because you are different artists putting into the colours.

38:06.562 --> 38:07.623
How they felt this.

38:07.643 --> 38:08.625
These are outstanding.

38:08.665 --> 38:14.373
I mean, this might have even been the... I mean, I can't believe that all of them were of that quality.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.575
No, certainly not.

38:15.595 --> 38:16.496
It's outstanding.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.679
And you've seen so much gold.

38:19.013 --> 38:23.037
It was for a very, well, important person.

38:23.317 --> 38:24.178
Possibly a monarch.

38:24.198 --> 38:30.504
Yes, a monarch, certainly, or a very, like a Medici or something like that.

38:30.544 --> 38:31.645
Very important.

38:31.665 --> 38:33.667
I would think so.

38:34.127 --> 38:36.069
And this was a gift from whom once more?

38:36.429 --> 38:37.110
We don't know.

38:37.210 --> 38:37.850
Oh, we don't know.

38:38.071 --> 38:39.152
We don't know.

38:39.172 --> 38:42.054
I mean... Doesn't say.

38:42.495 --> 38:46.378
Maybe in the archives, but they are not open from this time.

38:46.398 --> 38:48.160
But I mean a gift to the...

38:48.292 --> 38:48.953
To the king.

38:48.973 --> 38:49.533
To the king.

38:49.553 --> 38:50.935
We don't know who gave that either?

38:50.995 --> 38:52.577
No, it doesn't serve.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.039
So it's been here how long then?

38:55.860 --> 38:59.564
Well, when the old king died in 1972.

38:59.584 --> 39:01.967
It came into the library.

39:03.068 --> 39:04.129
Only 25 years?

39:04.489 --> 39:04.570
Yes.

39:04.650 --> 39:05.751
And we don't know who gave it?

39:06.051 --> 39:06.652
No, no, no.

39:06.752 --> 39:07.132
We don't.

39:07.473 --> 39:08.233
It doesn't serve.

39:08.734 --> 39:09.955
But even though it's that recent?

39:10.816 --> 39:17.083
No, we have asked the former librarian who worked here, and he doesn't know.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.663
gift from 25 years ago.

39:21.864 --> 39:33.020
Well it could be 50 years ago because it's first when the old king died it moved into here before it was in his private apartment.

39:33.761 --> 39:38.648
It's difficult to follow but you when you read this and you can always ask me.

39:39.089 --> 39:39.670
I see it now.

39:41.032 --> 39:44.657
I understand because you as a librarian

39:44.857 --> 39:49.703
would immediately know, because that's your job, bibliography, taking down details.

39:50.364 --> 39:54.288
But on the other hand, you can only deal with material when you get it.

39:54.809 --> 39:55.270
Exactly.

39:55.370 --> 39:59.535
And the only time you get it is when the monarch goes on to his final reward.

39:59.895 --> 40:00.656
Exactly.

40:01.016 --> 40:04.461
And at that point the stuff comes in... It's a lovely way to put it.

40:04.481 --> 40:10.628
And at that point the material comes in one big block and it may have records and it just as easily may not.

40:10.878 --> 40:21.899
Exactly, and before it comes in one block here, into the Bernadotte Library, you have all the answers, well, his children, and they are allowed to pick what they want.

40:23.122 --> 40:24.264
As mementos?

40:24.284 --> 40:26.448
Yes.

40:26.468 --> 40:27.390
But they didn't pick it.

40:28.212 --> 40:29.494
It was perhaps hidden.

40:30.757 --> 40:35.823
If the king had a librarian, how would I act as a librarian?

40:35.943 --> 40:38.145
I don't answer that question.

40:39.727 --> 40:43.772
All we know is which king it came in from, and how he got it, we don't know.

40:43.992 --> 40:44.693
No.

40:44.713 --> 40:57.067
He was a lot abroad, you know, and travelled, and if the little letter there in it and a note fell out or into the Bernadotte archives, it's lost just right now.

40:57.327 --> 41:00.190
It might be found later.

41:01.047 --> 41:02.429
And here's Norway again.

41:05.592 --> 41:06.353
That's delightful.

41:06.433 --> 41:24.893
Yes you see they knew all about these fjords and I think it's so pretty with the little ships here and the lovely gold and here's just the emblem still the Norwegian with a lion standing up.

41:24.934 --> 41:26.295
Is this one of your favorite books?

41:27.473 --> 41:29.456
Yes, because I think it's so beautiful.

41:29.516 --> 41:31.418
The maps are so beautiful.

41:31.699 --> 41:37.247
They are not just ordinary maps because of the colouring and the cartouche.

41:38.348 --> 41:48.943
I know somebody has been sitting here working, well, and then it was put into a book, of course, but really, it's unusual.

41:49.103 --> 41:52.007
It's the most beautiful map, I think, in this library.

41:52.348 --> 41:52.588
Yes.

41:54.731 --> 41:56.974
And your training is as a librarian?

41:57.545 --> 42:04.772
I have been librarian now for 20 years, and so has my colleague.

42:04.792 --> 42:05.453
Yes?

42:05.473 --> 42:09.717
And so, what do you try to do in this library?

42:10.218 --> 42:16.964
Well, in this library, I look, yes, I look after the treasures here, that they are fine.

42:17.145 --> 42:20.408
I look after the book treasure, the condition.

42:21.469 --> 42:27.535
You have to be, have a well surveyed very carefully, because it's

42:28.038 --> 42:36.607
shall continue, and we write articles, my colleague and I, in the Swedish press.

42:37.067 --> 42:54.265
We have a television here, who makes a lot of programs coming out to the Swedish people, because the king has said, well, it's open for researchers and even the press,

42:54.599 --> 43:02.547
You can write about it, but of course we have some notes in the books that we don't show everybody that might be very personal.

43:02.988 --> 43:05.310
You mean from a reader?

43:06.491 --> 43:09.454
Being one of the kings or queens.

43:11.296 --> 43:14.239
Were they great readers, would you say?

43:14.259 --> 43:16.021
Yes, they are.

43:16.041 --> 43:17.082
And they travel a lot.

43:17.322 --> 43:19.264
And when you travel, you read.

43:20.045 --> 43:22.007
Yes, it's such a nice...

43:22.763 --> 43:27.669
If you don't mind when we talk, is that all right with you?

43:27.689 --> 43:28.730
Yes, Carl, you say your name.

43:28.810 --> 43:29.511
Yes, just say your name.

43:30.012 --> 43:31.453
Antoinette Ramsey.

43:31.473 --> 43:33.055
Okay, that's not difficult.

43:33.075 --> 43:33.596
That's good.

43:33.656 --> 43:37.140
And your position here at the library?

43:37.240 --> 43:38.722
Well, we are librarians.

43:38.762 --> 43:42.366
Yeah, we are librarians, colleagues.

43:43.187 --> 43:50.796
We've been here for like 18 years, and first we had this dynamic

43:51.350 --> 43:57.118
palace librarian Dr. Heimovsky, and unfortunately died a couple of years ago.

43:57.959 --> 44:00.202
And we are just carrying on.

44:03.487 --> 44:06.050
And you work in another part of the palace, is that right?

44:06.070 --> 44:07.632
I work in this one as well.

44:08.213 --> 44:08.994
This is ours.

44:10.396 --> 44:11.818
Yes.

44:11.838 --> 44:16.885
And then we have like special positions or special

44:17.472 --> 44:18.493
areas.

44:18.653 --> 44:24.699
Carla is responsible for the royal photo collection, which is rare.

44:25.119 --> 44:26.961
The royal what collection, I'm sorry?

44:26.981 --> 44:27.341
Photo.

44:27.562 --> 44:28.422
Photo.

44:28.743 --> 44:29.383
Oh, photo.

44:29.403 --> 44:31.185
Yeah, half a million photos.

44:31.205 --> 44:32.506
Photos, yes.

44:32.526 --> 44:36.290
Half a million royal photos.

44:36.310 --> 44:39.072
Yes, that's what I mentioned about this.

44:39.092 --> 44:40.414
Are they catalogued, by the way?

44:41.034 --> 44:41.775
Yes, they are.

44:41.875 --> 44:43.136
The albums are catalogued.

44:44.097 --> 44:47.040
And then I mentioned to you about Antoinette

44:47.442 --> 44:58.538
her responsibility of Gustav Adolf, the sixth private library, which is within the Bernadotte library, but still in his private apartment.

44:59.019 --> 45:13.821
And I'm also then responsible for the modern, well you could say modern books or the art books for the Royal Collections people, and I'm serving them with the actual information.

45:14.172 --> 45:18.438
Hoping to be on the web in a little while.

45:19.199 --> 45:19.479
Really?

45:19.900 --> 45:21.041
Yes, yes.

45:21.061 --> 45:22.764
This is not open to the public, by the way.

45:22.784 --> 45:25.587
I think that's this room, this library.

45:25.607 --> 45:26.549
Yes and no.

45:26.949 --> 45:27.149
Yes.

45:27.630 --> 45:29.973
We shall discuss that, actually.

45:29.993 --> 45:30.093
Okay.

45:30.113 --> 45:36.602
And this is just for the piece, because when I write it, people will wonder... Actually, if they have a good reason.

45:36.869 --> 45:38.391
If you're a scholar, in other words.

45:38.451 --> 45:46.781
Yeah, and if you don't find the book somewhere else and we have it, we don't close our doors, we say you are welcome to look at it.

45:47.281 --> 45:49.524
Do you think you have books of that scarcity?

45:49.804 --> 45:50.024
Yes.

45:51.947 --> 46:01.678
What kinds of books in particular do you think that you would be unable... The French collection from Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, later our king, the first Bernadotte.

46:02.080 --> 46:05.084
And you know, we were special.

46:05.124 --> 46:10.490
We had almost complete the collection of the Taunitsch Library.

46:10.510 --> 46:15.115
Taunitsch edition from Leipzig.

46:15.876 --> 46:18.680
Bernard Tauschnitz.

46:19.621 --> 46:21.162
We can, yes.

46:21.183 --> 46:23.225
What did you call that?

46:23.285 --> 46:24.466
Tauschnitz collection?

46:24.486 --> 46:25.988
Tauschnitz.

46:26.008 --> 46:29.252
The British authors

46:29.789 --> 46:31.371
Edited, what do you say?

46:31.671 --> 46:32.593
In Germany?

46:32.613 --> 46:33.934
In Germany, yes.

46:34.014 --> 46:38.680
Published in Germany during a long period of time.

46:39.241 --> 46:40.803
I was in Leipzig two days ago.

46:40.823 --> 46:42.846
Yes, I thought about it.

46:42.886 --> 46:50.656
And this whole book community, I had no idea that whole area was what a great book center it was.

46:50.676 --> 46:51.076
It is.

46:51.096 --> 46:53.339
So you're mentioning these Leipzig things.

46:53.459 --> 46:58.125
A professor from, I think, Texas has written about it.

46:59.033 --> 47:02.097
Yeah, we can show you.

47:02.618 --> 47:04.701
Should we have a couple of tea now?

47:04.861 --> 47:06.463
Yes, that sounds wonderful.

47:06.483 --> 47:07.965
Let me just shut this up.

47:07.985 --> 47:11.931
I'm sorry, could you... ...by the king, that's very special.

47:11.951 --> 47:12.872
Would you say that again?

47:12.952 --> 47:14.574
My machine was off when you said that.

47:14.654 --> 47:14.975
Okay.

47:15.636 --> 47:26.070
I mean, we are special because the collections are private collections owned by kings and queens and they're still the kings

47:27.012 --> 47:29.915
this library is still the king's property.

47:32.857 --> 47:38.582
He is basically the inheritor of this, so these pass on from one to the next.

47:38.682 --> 47:39.543
Is that what you're saying?

47:39.663 --> 47:39.983
Yes.

47:40.764 --> 47:46.990
No, you have it in double, so you check me.

47:48.771 --> 47:55.517
That's very important for this new book that I'm writing because I am also interested in the

47:55.632 --> 48:00.118
important private libraries as we approach the next millennium.

48:00.158 --> 48:03.141
You know, there are still very important private libraries in the world.

48:03.762 --> 48:04.984
This apparently is one of them.

48:05.564 --> 48:09.669
Well, you're not behind these books at home, no?

48:09.689 --> 48:10.130
I'm sorry?

48:10.751 --> 48:13.714
Yes, I know that book.

48:14.115 --> 48:15.817
You're not behind it, no.

48:15.837 --> 48:18.360
No, I'm not.

48:18.380 --> 48:20.483
You might know the author.

48:20.503 --> 48:21.364
I don't.

48:21.684 --> 48:23.867
Is that good or bad?

48:24.775 --> 48:25.636
Do you know that book?

48:25.676 --> 48:27.478
Is this the library in that book?

48:27.498 --> 48:27.738
No.

48:27.818 --> 48:28.559
No, no.

48:29.079 --> 48:30.120
They are book collections.

48:30.261 --> 48:34.145
No, they haven't been here.

48:34.165 --> 48:34.585
They haven't been.

48:36.086 --> 48:36.747
Should I sit here?

48:36.767 --> 48:37.468
Yes, please.

48:37.628 --> 48:38.729
Wherever you want.

48:38.769 --> 48:39.069
Okay.

48:39.470 --> 48:41.252
I hurt my back with my briefcase.

48:41.272 --> 48:44.495
...catalogues from France.

48:44.515 --> 48:45.576
We are going to show you.

48:45.596 --> 48:45.896
Oh, good.

48:46.137 --> 48:46.917
They're very nice.

48:46.937 --> 48:50.261
Oh, and they are sent here to the Bernadotte Library.

48:50.581 --> 48:52.403
I am afraid.

48:52.619 --> 48:53.741
We pay nothing for them.

48:53.961 --> 48:56.225
We just receive them as gifts.

48:56.245 --> 48:57.687
And we never buy anything.

48:58.148 --> 48:59.009
Never.

48:59.029 --> 48:59.690
Never.

48:59.710 --> 49:00.652
That's interesting.

49:00.672 --> 49:02.435
This is not a library that acquires.

49:03.136 --> 49:04.258
That's very interesting.

49:04.738 --> 49:08.885
You really only acquire perhaps once every generation, when you think about it.

49:09.286 --> 49:12.130
Well, a little bit in between.

49:12.548 --> 49:22.745
And we acquire, of course, I acquire literature for the staff here to read for amusement or just for developing.

49:22.765 --> 49:24.568
For research perhaps.

49:24.588 --> 49:26.331
Yes, everything like that, you know.

49:26.351 --> 49:33.063
And we have an interesting collection of Bernard of Diana that we try to be perfect on.

49:33.283 --> 49:33.484
Yes.

49:33.524 --> 49:34.365
That's our aim.

49:35.928 --> 49:38.472
Will you have some things in English that might help me?

49:38.671 --> 49:43.557
Give me some perspective on the history and the Bernadette Iano that you're talking about.

49:43.577 --> 49:44.919
Yes, I have it in English.

49:44.959 --> 49:45.620
That will help me.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.703
Yes, it will help you certainly.

49:48.723 --> 49:51.907
But it might not be mentioned as Bernadette Iano.

49:51.927 --> 49:52.628
That's bad.

49:53.149 --> 49:58.916
Here I have taken copies from this catalogue.

49:58.956 --> 50:01.780
You can have a look at it so you get a picture.

50:01.800 --> 50:04.603
And could you give me the copyright page on it just to help?

50:05.284 --> 50:07.767
Yes, and here it is in English too.

50:08.152 --> 50:10.455
And from this book, it's fetched.

50:10.475 --> 50:11.997
And it's in English.

50:13.098 --> 50:16.722
Oh good, you did give me the... So I can credit it.

50:16.842 --> 50:18.765
Yes, exactly.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.128
But may I tell you a nice story?

50:21.168 --> 50:28.076
You know, I have a favorite bookseller who is a very humble fellow, an antiquarian bookseller.

50:28.737 --> 50:37.247
He bought the antiquarian bookshop in the house where Strindberg used to live his last years.

50:37.447 --> 50:41.952
is called the Blue Tower Antiquarian Bookshop.

50:42.973 --> 50:45.336
This fellow is a very humble fellow.

50:45.376 --> 51:01.395
He used to be working at a bookshop specialized in social democratic literature or something, you know, workers' literature and workers' union literature, something like that.

51:01.535 --> 51:07.302
And that bookshop was sold and the staff was cut down.

51:07.822 --> 51:13.871
So he bought this antiquarian bookshop and we were a bit worried about him.

51:14.251 --> 51:15.293
How will he manage?

51:16.314 --> 51:23.164
And he is going on, you know, I think he got it for five or six or seven years now.

51:23.665 --> 51:32.698
And sometimes when I need a book, I call him because he has surprises, really surprises.

51:33.286 --> 52:02.888
he's got almost everything I mean and he's not very expensive so I start always when I look for a book I start with this fellow and today on the first page in our newspaper here Dagens Nyheter was written that it was very difficult to find books by Dario Fo now this is the person you're telling me Nobel laureate yes but he had it he had bought the last

52:03.121 --> 52:10.071
you know, the rest from... He has a feeling.

52:11.973 --> 52:25.452
Some editors call themselves workers, culture, and he said it was too good to live out and not to have a continuous life.

52:26.274 --> 52:33.043
He has the feeling in his fingertips as the lovely ladies you were describing from Bronx

52:33.277 --> 52:39.923
the two ladies in the bibliography, how they felt it, the feeling.

52:39.943 --> 52:45.769
And I'm so happy because of him, you know, that he had, well, he had the rest.

52:46.410 --> 52:47.190
He had it here.

52:47.210 --> 52:52.035
Yeah, and those were the only books they could find in the town.

52:52.816 --> 52:53.496
Lovely.

52:53.516 --> 52:54.777
Even here in Stockholm.

52:54.798 --> 52:54.998
Yeah.

52:55.558 --> 53:00.583
And of course the Nobel Prize is taken very seriously all over the world, but here, because it's so

53:01.289 --> 53:05.176
so close to where the award is presented.

53:05.196 --> 53:10.065
Yeah, I was up, we were up, listening, when the door opened, you know.

53:10.085 --> 53:12.590
At the Swedish Academy here in Old Town.

53:13.030 --> 53:15.114
Five past one every year.

53:15.134 --> 53:24.070
And the secretary goes out and, you know, it's crowded with journalists and it's crowded with publishers.

53:24.231 --> 53:24.411
Yes.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.764
And sometimes we sneak in, you know, well, nobody's checking.

53:27.784 --> 53:29.706
We're just there for... This is yesterday?

53:29.767 --> 53:31.068
Yes.

53:31.409 --> 53:31.970
Can you tell me?

53:32.190 --> 53:32.851
That's wonderful.

53:32.991 --> 53:39.440
I love the fact, so coincidentally, that I'm here the day after this happened.

53:39.460 --> 53:42.944
So maybe you could share a little bit of this with me.

53:42.964 --> 53:43.545
Yes, certainly.

53:43.565 --> 53:44.727
So you were saying you were there.

53:44.747 --> 53:45.668
We were there.

53:45.688 --> 53:50.955
And, you know, there had been this, who is going to be John Cross,

53:51.188 --> 54:00.341
Portuguese authors from Indonesia or South Africa.

54:00.361 --> 54:01.643
So there was all kinds of speculation.

54:01.823 --> 54:15.643
Yeah, every year, you know, always on the day before and we said, well, everyone knew it's not going to be a poet, not a woman, because that was last year and, you know, all the speculations.

54:15.724 --> 54:17.466
And I thought probably this

54:17.733 --> 54:23.539
What is his name, this American poet or something?

54:23.579 --> 54:24.440
The poet again?

54:24.480 --> 54:25.200
You thought so?

54:25.321 --> 54:26.622
I didn't think of a poet again.

54:26.642 --> 54:27.783
Yeah, but I thought about him.

54:27.823 --> 54:28.203
Ammons?

54:28.223 --> 54:28.864
Ammons?

54:28.884 --> 54:29.104
Ammons?

54:29.124 --> 54:30.506
No, no, no.

54:30.526 --> 54:31.226
Well, never mind.

54:31.467 --> 54:32.908
I'm curious.

54:33.309 --> 54:35.911
Well, anyway, we were speculating.

54:36.151 --> 54:38.233
They were speculating also on Rushdie.

54:38.754 --> 54:39.014
Yeah.

54:40.075 --> 54:41.056
Yes.

54:41.076 --> 54:42.778
It was...

54:42.927 --> 54:53.338
Well, I wonder why his body of work isn't all that, I mean, it's more controversial, it's not that big yet.

54:53.358 --> 54:54.519
No, no, not yet.

54:54.539 --> 54:56.121
But the speculations.

54:56.341 --> 55:07.753
Yeah, and then, you know, he's saying, you could see all the editors, the publishers, they kind of lost their faces because they had nothing on, you know.

55:07.913 --> 55:10.696
And we others, just laughing.

55:11.316 --> 55:11.837
It was like,

55:12.205 --> 55:14.888
Oh, something completely new.

55:15.208 --> 55:17.370
Nobody has thought of it.

55:17.811 --> 55:19.172
Were you pleased?

55:19.192 --> 55:20.794
Yes, indeed.

55:20.814 --> 55:21.735
Now, why were you pleased?

55:22.516 --> 55:24.298
Because he's so controversial.

55:24.638 --> 55:26.500
The writer is.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.022
The writer is.

55:29.143 --> 55:32.226
And for the Academy to choose such a person.

55:32.246 --> 55:32.907
That's exciting?

55:33.167 --> 55:34.448
Yes, it is.

55:34.468 --> 55:37.892
It gives you hope that the Swedish Academy has a sense of humor.

55:38.125 --> 55:45.918
Because I talked about the Academy's reward to Oscar, the second year now.

55:46.078 --> 55:50.065
And there we, I meant that for you.

55:50.085 --> 55:57.016
And as we sit here right outside of the library, how close are we to where this announcement is made?

55:58.118 --> 55:59.701
Three minutes away from here.

55:59.841 --> 56:00.462
By foot?

56:00.482 --> 56:00.862
By foot.

56:01.684 --> 56:04.268
No more libraries over there.

56:05.159 --> 56:06.080
After the church.

56:06.381 --> 56:07.783
And I can walk by that and see it?

56:08.284 --> 56:08.384
Yeah.

56:08.404 --> 56:08.845
Yes.

56:09.385 --> 56:09.986
That's fine.

56:10.146 --> 56:11.809
I don't think you can come into it.

56:11.889 --> 56:13.251
It doesn't matter, but I can see it.

56:13.271 --> 56:14.733
We can call the librarian.

56:18.279 --> 56:18.379
Yeah.

56:18.399 --> 56:18.499
Yeah.

56:18.519 --> 56:19.420
That would be interesting.

56:19.520 --> 56:19.801
Yeah.

56:20.422 --> 56:22.885
Because this new book I'm writing is about book culture.

56:23.747 --> 56:24.648
Oh, yes.

56:25.229 --> 56:29.255
And you see, what you're saying here is very, very fascinating to me.

56:29.656 --> 56:34.643
Because you are so enthused about books and authors and serious authors.

56:34.825 --> 56:38.090
and how seriously this has been taken.

56:38.150 --> 56:46.423
This is a great encouragement to me, because you think of, is the book going to survive into the next, you know, people wonder.

56:46.563 --> 56:50.109
Yes, we all wonder.

56:50.309 --> 56:54.656
Of course it's going to survive.

56:54.716 --> 56:57.360
But tell me, how long are you in Stockholm?

56:57.380 --> 56:57.981
Through Sunday.

56:58.838 --> 56:59.379
I'll be here.

56:59.399 --> 57:01.241
I actually went up to Skokloster.

57:01.261 --> 57:03.143
Skokloster Council tomorrow.

57:03.163 --> 57:06.427
And then Sunday I'm leaving for the airport about 2 o'clock.

57:06.447 --> 57:08.609
And I'm totally free on Sunday.

57:08.629 --> 57:11.653
I tell you, I gave you the telephone number to the librarian.

57:11.813 --> 57:12.494
Okay.

57:12.514 --> 57:16.258
And he is an English-talking fellow, of course.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.723
But, I mean, he might be very busy.

57:21.224 --> 57:22.365
I totally understand.

57:23.086 --> 57:23.887
Yes, today.

57:23.927 --> 57:27.411
And he is the chief librarian at

57:27.610 --> 57:30.614
at the Nobel Library.

57:30.634 --> 57:32.516
Fifteen minutes would be great too.

57:32.536 --> 57:33.998
Fifteen minutes, okay.

57:34.178 --> 57:35.720
Try to arrange that.

57:36.120 --> 57:36.801
Very good.

57:38.063 --> 57:40.686
You wouldn't be disappointed in what I do with this.

57:41.767 --> 57:43.450
No, I'm not disappointed.

57:43.590 --> 57:45.212
I'm happy because it's so close.

57:45.612 --> 57:46.694
So you have to watch that.

57:46.714 --> 57:49.517
But I'm here the day after the Nobel Prize was awarded.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.444
And how often does this happen in life?

57:53.464 --> 57:54.004
No.

57:54.024 --> 57:55.847
It's meant for me to write about it.

57:55.867 --> 57:57.148
It is, really.

57:57.168 --> 58:00.753
You can't avoid it.

58:00.773 --> 58:02.054
No, certainly.

58:02.074 --> 58:04.838
So what I like is how, so, and every year does this happen?

58:04.878 --> 58:07.281
Do you become very anxious?

58:07.301 --> 58:13.949
Yes, and then we have this Nobel banquet at the 10th of December.

58:16.993 --> 58:19.977
And the banquet is held at the

58:20.227 --> 58:45.858
townhouse here in Stockholm and they receive the rewards in the concert hall in Stockholm and the day after this the king and queen invites all the Nobel Prize laurels and their families here on a fantastic banquet dinner in the palace.

58:45.878 --> 58:46.599
And it's wonderful.

58:46.899 --> 58:47.820
And it's wonderful.

58:48.053 --> 58:52.237
And do they ultimately go into the library here at some point?

58:52.577 --> 59:05.228
No, we don't do the same as Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Conference, because after the banquet, she often takes her guests into her private library.

59:06.389 --> 59:10.793
But in a way, we are happy that not all the guests are allowed to do.

59:10.813 --> 59:11.254
You don't want that?

59:11.274 --> 59:11.834
No, no, we don't.

59:11.854 --> 59:14.637
I think it's more efficient if you call yourself.

59:14.657 --> 59:14.977
Myself?

59:15.077 --> 59:16.018
Sure, happy to.

59:16.285 --> 59:19.650
So this is the number and this is the name of the librarian.

59:19.670 --> 59:21.913
Maybe you shall call him right away.

59:21.953 --> 59:23.215
Should I try?

59:23.595 --> 59:24.076
Yes.

59:24.677 --> 59:27.481
Say that again for my tape recorder, please.

59:27.501 --> 59:28.122
Yes.

59:28.142 --> 59:31.406
Mao Zedong was a librarian and Casanova was a librarian.

59:31.827 --> 59:35.412
Now you have more hot stuff to check.

59:36.053 --> 59:45.887
We had a Swedish revolutionary or anti-royalist called Tomas Tudin who ended his life in a bohemian private

59:46.171 --> 59:47.232
palace library.

59:47.813 --> 59:56.061
T-H-O-R-I-N-D T-H-O-R-I-N-D Which palace was that?

59:56.122 --> 59:57.423
Somewhere in Bohemia.

59:58.564 --> 59:59.665
He was a revolutionary?

01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:04.150
Yes, he had to leave the country for political reasons.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:08.735
But he is not lonely to the world.

01:00:09.616 --> 01:00:14.541
He was an author and he was close to the king Gustav III.

01:00:15.213 --> 01:00:26.704
And what happened, I really don't remember, but I remember he had to leave the country for political reasons.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:29.086
Are you trained as a librarian yourself also?

01:00:29.106 --> 01:00:33.331
You know, also that's another thing I'm looking at.

01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:37.615
Library schools are changing, by the way.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:43.060
They're about to become things of the past as we knew them.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.545
They aren't really teaching librarianship bibliography.

01:00:46.967 --> 01:00:50.805
They're teaching computer skills, too.
