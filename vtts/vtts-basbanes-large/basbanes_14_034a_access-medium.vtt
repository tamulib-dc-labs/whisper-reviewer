David Price.

00:15.509 --> 00:31.287
We're focusing today on contemporary issues of production of the book, yet for my twenty minutes, I'm going to go back to the Renaissance at the beginning of printing, to study some of the difficulties of these printers, editors, and designers in the production of the Bibles.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.764
It was different back then.

00:34.284 --> 00:41.913
Nowadays we don't worry that much about preaching the Bible.

00:42.513 --> 00:47.099
It's not something that causes so much anxiety.

00:47.379 --> 00:53.185
Whereas from the Renaissance period it was an act that always occasioned a tremendous amount of worry and concern.

00:53.205 --> 01:01.054
It was a time when the greatest intellect, even the most powerful kings and queens, were very much concerned with the production of the Bible.

01:01.372 --> 01:08.923
In the Renaissance, it was impossible to print the Bible without considering many facets of the simple question, what is the Bible?

01:09.884 --> 01:20.860
The question included the problem of canonicity, what are the books of the Bible, as well as the more basic problem of determining whether a text is authentic or not.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.004
An exceptionally difficult question concerns the ancient version.

01:24.372 --> 01:30.461
In particular, how authentic is the Latin Vulgate translation of St.

01:30.681 --> 01:37.370
Jerome that was the basis for liturgy and for theology in a Christian church in the West for over a thousand years?

01:38.111 --> 01:46.583
What must one make for those many passages that are missing in or do not quite do justice to the earliest Hebrew and Greek manuscripts?

01:48.217 --> 01:50.859
In some ways, the most confident Bibles are the first ones.

01:51.720 --> 02:04.092
Printing began with the Bible in a format designed to replicate the appearance of the manuscript Bible in folia, a style of monumentality and authority.

02:04.112 --> 02:06.374
Soon, other formats would follow.

02:07.055 --> 02:14.862
Many attendees should erupt and ready to use.

02:14.882 --> 02:15.743
That's what people write.

02:15.959 --> 02:23.130
Also, I want to mention that too.

02:25.894 --> 02:29.699
I'm really not too worried about the price, it doesn't fail either.

02:30.380 --> 02:41.697
Soon other formats appeared, and I'm showing you very briefly on the project, the first Octavo edition of the Bible, 1491.

02:42.233 --> 02:55.674
But all those scientific texts appeared, for the Vulgate manuscripts recorded a tremendous number of ancient systems, the result of erroneous transcription, interpolation, and unsuccessful attempts at correction.

02:57.117 --> 03:07.954
A major result of the first 75 years of preaching the Bible from Luther to Luther was that the manifold uncertainty of the text became widely appreciated.

03:08.423 --> 03:12.111
Consequently, editors and printers face a number of dilemmas.

03:12.633 --> 03:23.277
Most importantly, how should the authority of the Bible be represented, whether grounded in the church, state, theological principle, or in textual historical scholarship?

03:24.016 --> 03:39.899
This became a very serious question, or its immediate corollary was, as a text underwent Reformation, does that mean that the religious culture to the extent that it has developed from the now undermined or reconstituted authorities also face Reformation?

03:42.983 --> 03:51.255
The best way to stabilize a text with various meanings is systematically to collect and analyze the barriers, a process called collation.

03:51.387 --> 04:08.856
This had more or less been accomplished for the Hebrew Bible with the ancient Masoretic criticism of the text.

04:09.393 --> 04:14.240
We just saw it in 1488.

04:14.740 --> 04:29.641
We're seeing it in 1488, the very first edition of the complete .

04:29.661 --> 04:29.781
But...

04:31.246 --> 04:46.993
After the printing of 1488, the Hebrew Bible was the object of steady textual improvement until 1424-25 when the President Daniel Longbow issued the second great rabbinic Bible

04:46.973 --> 04:53.043
for correct printing of this matura.

04:53.163 --> 05:08.027
And this illustrates to us that the Renaissance Hebrew Bible depended entirely on the textual criticism of the mass religious, not on Renaissance scholars themselves.

05:08.047 --> 05:13.335
And this Bible was so correct, so generally satisfying, that it set a standard that lasted for 400 years.

05:14.328 --> 05:24.562
While the Hebrew Bible thus could depend on the criticism of the early Middle Ages, there was no comparable body of ancient textual criticism for the Greek New Testament.

05:26.224 --> 05:41.244
The Greek New Testament first appeared at the rather late days of 1516, and would not be stabilized in all of its textual variance to general satisfaction until 1550, with the publication of an edition by Old L.P.M.

05:41.324 --> 05:43.407
which you have seen on your left.

05:45.547 --> 05:59.681
This edition, which is among the typographical masterpieces of the Renaissance, was published with the authority of the King of Crafts, making its royalty, a designation echoed in the name of the elegant font of Cloth-Germont's collection noir.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.011
In addition to artistry and

06:04.497 --> 06:15.520
In addition to the art history, the scholarship of this book was so impressive that its text would be designated the Text History Chapters, the received or motivated text.

06:16.261 --> 06:19.047
It would also be called the Protestant Pope.

06:21.457 --> 06:24.923
Above all, it is important for us to notice that A.T.N.

06:25.063 --> 06:42.132
documented the manuscript authority for his reading, providing barriers in the margins, allowing readers to understand the substance of the manuscript tradition and also to disagree with his editorial decision and theoretically to alter the text.

06:43.951 --> 06:45.833
Prior to the refinements of A.P.M.

06:46.013 --> 06:53.380
and Baumau, the most radical formats of the Renaissance Bible were the multiple version or polyglot violets.

06:53.400 --> 07:03.509
Consciously or not, these important imprints address the issue of the sufficiency of the ball gates, and they almost always do so with ambivalence or contradiction.

07:04.370 --> 07:12.557
The most spectacular of these was the Comfortenzi polyglot, and the most controversial was Erasmus' zyglot violets.

07:14.090 --> 07:28.736
The Constantinian Polyglot, the masterpiece of Spanish Humanism, is a six-volume work published in 1522 that presents a biblical text in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin.

07:29.577 --> 07:35.828
The imprint documents the thesis of its editor-in-chief, Cardinal Jiménez, that, quote,

07:36.078 --> 07:53.952
meaning of heavenly wisdom can emerge from any language, but that, after translating, Scripture still remains full of meanings which are not able to be understood in any way other than from the very fonts of the original language."

07:54.775 --> 07:58.743
And here we see the tremendous anxiety about the status of the Vulgate.

07:59.244 --> 08:10.388
The editors contradict this undertaking by asserting the religious superiority of the Latin Vulgate over the textuality of Judaism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

08:11.144 --> 08:31.718
The introduction describes the typographical layout with the Vulgate and the central column flanked by the original Hebrew and the Septuagint Greek translation as an analogy to, quote, Christ on the cross in between the two deeds.

08:31.738 --> 08:33.321
Without mentioning any Christ dependence on Christ.

08:33.993 --> 08:48.987
The typography attempts to authenticate the Vulgate by providing an alphabetic system of coordinates that connects every word in the Vulgate to a word in the original Hebrew.

08:49.007 --> 08:52.795
This system was also used in the New Testament to a certain degree.

08:53.247 --> 09:02.899
I'm showing you here the passage in Arceus 7.14, where the correspondence between Wirgo, virgin, and Alkmaa, young woman, is a surgeon.

09:03.179 --> 09:13.151
Of course, an incorrect translation that's been pointed out in certain audiences, even in the 20th century, can provoke tremendous unhappiness.

09:13.171 --> 09:17.497
That was one of the big problems of the New Revolution.

09:17.517 --> 09:22.022
Nonetheless, the inconsistencies between the virgins were powerful.

09:22.643 --> 09:36.184
When Erasmus published his first Greek text for the New Testament, he had the Samaritans to translate scripture fresh into Latin, thereby impugning the Hulgate's authority.

09:37.346 --> 09:40.230
In the dedicatory letter to Pope Leo X,

09:40.649 --> 09:55.495
Erasmus proclaimed the original text as a foundation, even if it still looked like rubble, for a reconstruction of the temple, an analogy of doctrinal reformation to Leo's rebuilding of St.

09:55.515 --> 09:56.717
Peter's kingdom.

09:57.440 --> 10:02.026
Nonetheless, the new Latin translation shook the foundations of St.

10:02.046 --> 10:10.919
Peter's, for it showed all too clearly that the Greek did not support several theological conclusions that had been drawn from the Latin Vulgate.

10:10.939 --> 10:21.574
These were not incidentals, they included the sacrament of reconciliation, and Erasmus' wording in many cases was suspected of having diminished the divinity of Christ.

10:22.060 --> 10:49.772
So great were the controversies, and so bitter the hard feelings of eclectic circles once Luther had entered the page, that beginning with his fourth edition of 1527, Erasmus printed the Vulgate with the Greek and with his own version, an attempt, backpedaling rapidly, to authenticate the Vulgate and also to stress the general compatibility of his version with it.

10:51.305 --> 10:53.587
These are squabbles about scholarly editions.

10:54.669 --> 11:02.176
Anxiety about the text's authority increased exponentially as Princey put books into the hands of ordinary people.

11:02.196 --> 11:10.906
Indeed, the scholarly analysis of the Bible raised the issue of preparing reliable translations in the vernacular for general readership.

11:11.967 --> 11:18.814
Even when vernacular Bibles were legal, and there were many 15th century Bibles in German and Italian,

11:18.963 --> 11:29.783
The question remained as to whether the Bible in the hands of the people would foster faith, fire imaginations of heresy, or even worse, result in social revolution.

11:31.746 --> 11:35.453
The early Lutheran design for the Bible

11:35.669 --> 11:40.578
was intended to destabilize the concept of authority in a general way.

11:41.500 --> 11:48.653
It is intriguing that the Lutheran Bibles do not claim special distinction from their foundation in the original languages.

11:49.214 --> 11:59.533
It's a private strategy because Luther was hardly the first to put the Bible into German, but he was the first to base the German Bible on the Hebrew and the Greek.

11:59.817 --> 12:07.060
Even more surprisingly, the Lutheran Bibles printed in Wittenberg are designed to look like ordinary books.

12:07.428 --> 12:14.538
They create a visual tone of everydayness rather than a tone of resultedness, befitting a timeless authority.

12:15.539 --> 12:23.289
The text is printed in one block, but the typography relaxed, unpretentious, but that is probably vernacular.

12:23.690 --> 12:32.001
It is really a kind of rough, common, popular typeset approach to the image of the typeset.

12:32.605 --> 12:52.468
Luther himself spoke of his translation as a book bound by temporal contingencies, acknowledging repeatedly that the translation must be sense for sense, put as plainly and idiomatically as possible, that the words were dependent on contemporary usage, not the syntax of antiquity.

12:52.488 --> 12:59.777
Luther once said that people reading a vernacular version should have the feeling that the Bible had been written only yesterday.

13:04.634 --> 13:15.898
I believe we can get a good sense of Luther's attitude by looking at the title page of the first complete Lutheran Bible, the result of a tremendous scholarly and literary effort of some 12 years.

13:15.918 --> 13:21.310
Despite his labor, the feat of completion is represented with a charming display of playfulness.

13:21.813 --> 13:28.487
The title page for the first Lutheran translation does not convey the feeling of the German word with timeless authority.

13:29.048 --> 13:36.103
Rather, it looks as if the Putti have just barely finished the whole in time for its first before the public of Guru's debut.

13:36.844 --> 13:38.067
The point may be,

13:38.266 --> 13:54.905
But the word of translation is never concluded, even if God superintends this moment of performing the latest, but never the last version, which will warrant for the immutability of the message.

13:54.925 --> 13:56.308
May God's word remain forever.

13:58.145 --> 14:05.389
The populous style of the Lutheran Bible had other properties that are less appealing to modern sensibilities.

14:05.410 --> 14:10.888
It was designed to promote its popular antagonism against the authority of the Catholic Church.

14:11.290 --> 14:23.626
One might go so far as to compare the first edition of the Lutheran New Testament to the ferocious polemical pamphlets of the era, especially those with popular imagery.

14:23.646 --> 14:38.125
In particular, marginal notes betray confessional biases, and in what we might call the Bible's visual boxes, that is the illustration, the papacy appears most dramatically as the Antichrist in the scripture.

14:39.455 --> 14:45.668
The heart of Babylon includes the beast from the bottomless pit of revelation where papal crowns

14:48.263 --> 14:52.429
The Lutheran's visual gloss does not aim solely at any film.

14:53.010 --> 14:54.533
It is much more offensive than that.

14:55.154 --> 15:02.285
It offers a seriously intense interpretation that the Bible prophesies the Antichrist's emergence in the papacy.

15:02.305 --> 15:12.901
This is a view Luther would hold throughout his life and one that would inform the Lutheran illustrations of it with other revelations henceforth.

15:12.921 --> 15:14.203
Idiom and polemic aside,

15:14.437 --> 15:21.771
One of the boldest moves in his early Lutheran inference in the New Testament was the reassessment of the canon.

15:21.871 --> 15:34.656
Luther argued that his definition of the gospel, the promise of salvation by faith alone, and his identification of scripture of the law and the gospel could help implicate what belonged to the canon of the Bible.

15:34.889 --> 15:45.426
He was daring enough to write, in the preface of his first translation, that four books in the New Testament did not articulate the Gospel methods adequately.

15:45.446 --> 15:56.965
These he grouped together and ended the New Testament in partial contribution of all the traditional sequences and did not assign the number to those books of the New Testament.

15:58.565 --> 16:05.955
This style of authentication and polemics informed the early history of the English Bible as well.

16:07.016 --> 16:19.152
Although he did consult the original Greek and Hebrew, William Tyndale in large measure English Luther's German version, including several of Luther's notes and prologues.

16:20.113 --> 16:27.323
The Tyndale imprints, however, can look even more popular and more subversive than the Lutheran models.

16:27.472 --> 16:35.222
Unlike Luther's, after all, Tyndale's Bible started life, his Bible started life with alcohol.

16:35.242 --> 16:41.289
Indeed, they were burned in bonfires, just as their author would be.

16:41.329 --> 16:56.668
The first attempt to print an English Bible, and that is where Tyndale on the right, his Bible in his very first attempt, was stopped by authorities in Cologne after ten signatures of a fourth of the New Testament had been completed.

16:58.133 --> 17:05.559
But, from that fragment we know that the original Tyndale New Testament was designed to have all of the characteristics of Luther's New Testament.

17:06.360 --> 17:14.427
The theological and polemical side-depth table of contents you're looking at with the altar canon and the introduction of Luther's version.

17:15.668 --> 17:27.718
The first legal Tyndale Bible appeared in 1537 with a title-page point cut between Tyndale 100.

17:27.867 --> 17:32.439
with the title page woodcut taken from an important Lutheran Bible, 1534.

17:33.061 --> 17:39.278
The authorizing principle here is the Lutheran concept of the law and the gospel.

17:40.591 --> 17:48.826
This imprint was one of four authorized English versions to appear before the King James Version.

17:49.126 --> 18:02.751
And those four altogether are the Coverdale, 1535, this one you look at in the left, which is called the Matthew Bible, the Great Bible, 1539, and the Bishop Bible, 1568, which turns to the second left.

18:03.136 --> 18:07.742
All of these were designed as stately lectern Bibles and folios.

18:08.222 --> 18:21.118
They were typically presented with a prominent display of the royal supremacy, the English law of Ephesians 15-34 that crowned with the ultimate authority for religious values in England.

18:21.138 --> 18:31.911
Which you see very clearly on the first English title page, the first reading of the Bible, the covering of the title page on the right at the bottom, Henry VIII is dispensing the Bible to

18:31.891 --> 18:44.065
both Archbishop Cranmer and to Vice-Regent Thomas Cranmer.

18:44.185 --> 18:56.599
A new conceptualization of the English Bible as the Book of the People appeared in 1560 with the publication of the Geneva version.

18:57.912 --> 19:07.385
The Geneva Bible, the runaway bestseller during Elizabeth's reign, was a Bible that government did not endorse, even if it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth.

19:08.207 --> 19:16.018
It originated among the exiles fleeing the grief for bloody persecution under Queen Mary.

19:16.458 --> 19:23.228
But by the time it appeared in 1560, there was no legal impediment to its distribution in England.

19:23.630 --> 19:32.742
Perhaps in response to these dramatic changes in political climate, its design combines qualities of the subversive, popular, and authoritative.

19:33.983 --> 19:47.140
Arriving in popular dissent, the editors, backed up by the resources of the Genevan Academy and its French language bibles, used a principle of access to the fullness of scholarship as its authorizing principle.

19:48.115 --> 19:55.965
This directly floutes the enriching custom and quasi-law that no private opinion be expressed in the notes of printed Bibles.

19:56.766 --> 20:00.892
The design, fittingly, evokes both popular and scholarly qualities.

20:01.532 --> 20:08.001
The authoritative two-column look of the Bible as a monument is used here in small format.

20:08.021 --> 20:09.383
This is actually a small folio.

20:09.403 --> 20:13.248
The original was of course, but I hope you have a picture of it.

20:13.268 --> 20:17.413
It's similar to this, but you can imagine it's chopped off three quarters of the way down.

20:18.085 --> 20:27.715
The almost unprecedented use of a Roman font gives the imprint clarity and also the aura of Latin learning.

20:28.316 --> 20:40.648
At this time, Latin books, and not vernacular books, were set to relate the Roman type in English.

20:40.668 --> 20:42.270
The success of the Geneva Bible, and it went through 144 positions in the years,

20:42.757 --> 20:54.911
The success of the Geneva may have become the source of its own downfall, for its distinctive interpretive apparatus grew ever more extensive and also increasingly contentious.

20:54.931 --> 21:04.022
It prevailed over the Bishop's Bible in the homes of the people, for its text was lucid and its learning seemed the source of self-empowerment.

21:04.475 --> 21:15.689
But a richly Calvinist message eventually overwhelmed the biblical text, so numerous for the notes that virtually everyone could find something noisome.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.033
King James I

21:18.008 --> 21:30.031
For King James I, a Calvinist comment on iconoclasm that boldly endorsed race and reticite was beyond the pale.

21:30.051 --> 21:37.806
I've been showing you an image from a 1607 newspaper that actually represents the most extreme development of the scholarly apparatus written for a lot of translations.

21:39.085 --> 21:45.574
Before the King James Version, the Church of England sponsored a new Bible as an answer to the Geneva Version.

21:46.015 --> 21:56.250
It is called the Bishop's Bible because the philosophical work was organized by Archbishop Matthew Parker and done by him and other bishops in the realm.

21:57.171 --> 22:03.220
And if you look at it in the past, you probably think it might be difficult to call it the Queen Elizabeth Version.

22:03.402 --> 22:12.014
The textual result was a modern reworking of Tyndale as present in the Great Bible Version.

22:12.034 --> 22:17.462
The Bishop's Bible is typographically the most majestic of the 16th century English Bibles.

22:18.343 --> 22:25.273
It is also a magnificent display of the law of royal supremacy, the crown's authority over the church and the realm.

22:25.894 --> 22:31.502
For the time of day, the first edition displays a large form of an image of the queen herself,

22:31.870 --> 22:43.888
This exquisitely engraved title page proclaims no theological concept that provides authority, it is just the authority of the government that authenticated this version.

22:43.928 --> 22:54.064
The richly illustrated design also inserts courtly portraiture into the text

22:54.635 --> 23:01.385
The court favorites, William Cecil and Lord Robert Dudley, appear in engravings.

23:01.465 --> 23:08.535
Cecil is presented on your right as a biblical scholar who did have tremendous confidence in his language.

23:10.358 --> 23:14.364
And Dudley is on your right, introducing the second part of the Old Testament.

23:14.384 --> 23:23.097
Rather more, if you've seen the movie, Elizabeth is the more dignified setting for his portrait.

23:23.117 --> 23:24.118
The King James Version,

23:25.162 --> 23:36.643
which entailed a rigorous review of the scholarship, as well as the artistry of previous translations, also responded to the dilemma of how to present the Bible appropriately.

23:38.025 --> 23:47.102
First, in what is probably a conception of pure sensibility, the text is not presented as being dependent on the loyal will.

23:47.318 --> 23:55.916
The printing was licensed by the Crown, initially with an extensive copyright, but the printer Robert Barber acquired 3,500 pounds.

23:56.437 --> 23:58.582
But distribution was not a royal pact.

23:59.564 --> 24:03.572
Instead of the royal supremacy, the most common title-paged concept

24:04.227 --> 24:21.303
expressed the unity of Scripture in comparison to the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles of Jesus, which even suggests the Covenants of Theology of Calvinism.

24:21.323 --> 24:23.225
And that, in fact, was on the original.

24:23.245 --> 24:24.306
The first we called it a 16-left title page.

24:24.326 --> 24:26.048
And the 12 tribes were represented within the disciples of the law.

24:26.068 --> 24:31.973
And in this, this is the more typical presentation of the 7th century of King James.

24:31.993 --> 24:33.795
It was a very dramatic presentation of that analogy.

24:34.703 --> 24:44.418
The iconography of Loyal Supremacy may well have been brought up in Holgarity, and in life is sent to the Geneva Bible an inadequate mode of authorization.

24:45.861 --> 24:51.049
The translators and designers chose a format dramatically different from that of the Geneva.

24:52.070 --> 24:56.998
Apart from the historical material in the preface, the King James Version is unflossed.

24:57.350 --> 25:07.821
It also departs from the bishop's file by being unillustrated, except for the few illustrations on the historical introduction.

25:07.841 --> 25:26.901
Without expressing theological or historical opinion, the biblical text is supported by only three types of textual notes, references to parallel passages, content notes to a volume of passages, and most important, typographical indication of where the English text

25:27.185 --> 25:34.293
in smooth idiomatic form departs from the original Greek and Hebrew.

25:34.313 --> 25:34.633
I'm sorry.

25:34.733 --> 25:51.071
You can see the departures from the original languages are indicated in Roman type, whereas the text of the one has great confidence in the black letter.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.614
Can you see some of those examples of Roman type?

25:56.615 --> 26:02.383
And this is obviously an attempt at providing a bare test for the people.

26:02.403 --> 26:09.192
In response to the popular market, small size form designs were developed by the following year, in 1612.

26:09.732 --> 26:13.037
The first octavo, the first cordas came out there.

26:13.117 --> 26:24.492
And they also used two column Roman font designs derived from the Geneva, and in this case used the palace to indicate textual problems in English translations.

26:24.512 --> 26:25.153
Thus,

26:25.353 --> 26:35.910
The authorized version in its format negotiates monumentality and vernacularism on the one hand, and the authority and uncertainty of the text on the other.

26:35.930 --> 26:41.700
Its authority emanates from the text which stands alone, unillustrated and largely unannotated.

26:42.381 --> 26:49.032
Yet this text conveys, typographically, the findings of the philological and historical scholarship.

26:49.214 --> 27:00.013
The King James Version brilliantly answers the question, what is the Bible, and also indicates in the subtlety of the format and design what is not the Bible.

27:00.033 --> 27:13.095
If we look back to the very beginning of printing...

27:16.282 --> 27:18.633
Right in the back.

27:19.181 --> 27:19.525
Back in the back.

27:20.585 --> 27:47.715
If we look back to the very beginning of printing and reflect on where we have gotten in the 150 years we've just covered, we might conclude that what primarily differentiates the Gugler of the King James Version is not at all a shift from the traditional to the reform, nor a move from the monumental to the vernacular, but rather the replacement of an invisible confidence in the text with visible evidence for the authority of each of the words in the Word of God.

27:48.316 --> 27:48.516
Thank you.

28:02.789 --> 28:31.205
That's why I have the first sign up.

28:31.225 --> 28:31.345
Great.

28:35.527 --> 28:41.794
I dreamed of doing a Bible for over 30 years.

28:41.814 --> 28:44.137
A dream that was both sweet and terrifying.

28:45.378 --> 28:49.683
Like all dreams, it came from somewhere inside me.

28:50.844 --> 28:55.810
There were no coercive voices that said I had to do it.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.793
No publisher commissioned it.

28:58.893 --> 29:00.555
Yet I was compelled to do it.

29:01.193 --> 29:13.771
In fact, I feel that everything in my life, from six years in a military school, to pearl hunting, to three years as an itinerant Methodist preacher, has led me inexorably to it.

29:15.013 --> 29:30.154
And it was often a frightening place to be, frightening because it assumes standards that go beyond the already difficult and concrete nature of fine typography, good draftsmanship, solid design, and clean engraving.

29:31.180 --> 29:43.234
Frightening because it assumes standards that are, by their very nature, speculative and extend toward the nature of God and divine teachings.

29:43.254 --> 30:00.715
Frightening because whether or not I wished it or intended it, I knew that every time I made an image, I would be taking a theological position, and this would leave me vulnerable to misunderstanding, miscalculation, naivete, and stupidity.

30:03.243 --> 30:13.478
When it comes to images, I have an allergy to the obvious and expected, to the corny and cute, to happy and trite.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.743
I avoid them whenever I can recognize them.

30:18.465 --> 30:25.095
But one cannot avoid Adam and Eve, happy as though it is, and claim to have illustrated by them.

30:26.196 --> 30:30.162
One cannot ignore the garden or the servants, even though

30:30.513 --> 30:41.950
And even though an illustrator is wedded to attack, he can maneuver within it to establish fresh points of view and find new and provocative light.

30:41.970 --> 30:46.677
Indeed, this is the illustrator's responsibility.

30:46.697 --> 30:51.945
For instance, my Adam and Eve were originally happening.

30:51.965 --> 30:59.035
Since the human species sprang up in the old divided gorge, I felt that it was a reasonable and logical point of view

30:59.723 --> 31:06.913
Besides that, I figured he would piss off Pat Robertson and Jerry Paul.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.875
Anything that does that can't be all bad.

31:11.379 --> 31:18.228
The idea remained firm for a long time, so I went to a dinner party in Princeton in 1995.

31:19.029 --> 31:29.443
Two of my companions, Joyce Carol Otis and Alexander Nahimas, thought the idea was sound and would ring a wake-up bell for many readers at the outset.

31:29.963 --> 31:42.880
But John Fleming took exception, arguing that since racial characteristics were much, much later in manifesting themselves, the only appropriate position would be one that was racially moot.

31:44.362 --> 31:48.908
It became apparent that my personal politics were getting in the way of my work.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.372
This is not African literature.

31:53.434 --> 31:55.536
It is not European literature.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.300
It's Semitic literature.

31:59.377 --> 32:06.926
So I had to ask myself, what image of Adam and Eve did the Semitic authors have in mind?

32:06.946 --> 32:09.729
Because that is to whom I owe my allegiance.

32:10.910 --> 32:16.096
The text thinks very clearly that God made Adam after his own image.

32:16.116 --> 32:25.266
Midrash, Jewish commentaries on Hebrew scripture, tells us that he was the most beautiful man that would ever be.

32:25.286 --> 32:25.907
But,

32:26.157 --> 32:29.565
Does beauty have only to do with the young?

32:30.968 --> 32:35.077
Are we to think of God as Apollo or Adonis?

32:36.159 --> 32:39.847
Shouldn't we consider the beauty inherent in age and wisdom?

32:41.270 --> 32:41.972
I think yes.

32:43.083 --> 32:53.141
So, taking a cue from Rembrandt's etching of a been around the block a few times avenue, I seen them as an older couple.

32:53.161 --> 32:58.871
Their faces are in shadow, allowing you to see there what you want to see.

32:58.891 --> 33:01.075
The serpent, not yet on his belly,

33:01.156 --> 33:13.189
is carefully hidden behind a tree, suggesting that he is a warrior, hiding, watching, and perhaps, as some in Russian tradition, timing, waiting to have his way with Eve.

33:14.830 --> 33:25.341
God's presence is suggested by the river, prefiguring Ezekiel's simile, comparing God's voice to the noise of many waters.

33:25.361 --> 33:30.927
I never represented God, didn't want to, couldn't have if I wanted to.

33:32.358 --> 33:51.983
but I did represent the natural attributes given to him by the authors, smoke, clouds, water, lightning, and approaching storm, such as this one looming over Noah's sons as they prepared the ark for the oncoming day.

33:52.003 --> 33:54.366
This image, like many others, owes a debt,

33:54.683 --> 34:07.301
to extra-biblical sources, in this case to an old Romanian folktale about Noah's two cats who evict the devil when he is discovered on board in the guise of a very large and sinister rat.

34:09.143 --> 34:11.146
Cats are nowhere mentioned in the Bible.

34:12.828 --> 34:18.396
This image hopes to amend that slight oversight.

34:18.629 --> 34:27.377
The primary theme of my illustrations for the Bible is, for lack of a more original phrase, the human condition.

34:27.397 --> 34:35.444
The ordinary day-to-day problems and passions of the human heart, as William Faulkner put it.

34:35.464 --> 34:38.967
And it will probably get me in deep doo-doo with the fundamentals.

34:40.488 --> 34:42.730
My characters are not pious.

34:43.751 --> 34:48.535
They do not carry the odor of sanctity with them, nor the beauty of holiness.

34:49.190 --> 34:54.597
They are real people, neither stylized nor archetypical.

34:54.617 --> 34:56.980
They live in both light and shadow.

34:58.262 --> 35:06.352
There's somebody you might know, like the boy Donald Hall, who sat for this portrait of Ecclesiastes.

35:06.372 --> 35:10.016
And like Ecclesiastes, they are, for the most part, seen alone.

35:11.378 --> 35:18.387
Alone because it is a convention of portraiture, and alone because that is where, ultimately, we all meet

35:18.738 --> 35:25.906
and wrestled with God, or with the idea of God.

35:25.926 --> 35:37.500
Here is the young Abram, a formal portrait of a tall young man full of life and vigor, a man on the cusp of founding a nation, a people.

35:39.222 --> 35:47.091
And here is Job, alone in prison, in prison because he rejected the amorous advances of Potiphar's wife, Zella.

35:47.223 --> 35:52.729
Scorned, Zoica tells her husband that Joseph tried to force himself on her, and she ran away.

35:53.770 --> 35:55.112
Potiphar, of course, believes her.

35:56.153 --> 36:02.841
His wrath is kindled against Joseph and throws him into the hooscow.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.923
And here is Moses at the Red Sea.

36:06.024 --> 36:10.429
Moses, the only man in the Old Testament who knew God face to face.

36:11.101 --> 36:15.466
stands atop a stony embankment at the edge of the sea.

36:15.486 --> 36:23.516
His people, offstage here, are following him because they believe he is working on God's instructions.

36:23.536 --> 36:34.729
But if he heard God wrong or misunderstood, and you know he must have had his doubts because he was, after all, human.

36:35.992 --> 36:42.724
The hard-won exodus will end here, and a heap of torn flesh is the bottom of this cliff.

36:44.446 --> 37:00.514
Moses stands alone, hoping, with Pharaoh's armies closing in fast upon them, that he heard God's instructions write, hoping that the sea will part and his people will pass on safely into the promised land.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.412
Moses stands alone too, although in an entirely different way.

37:07.713 --> 37:29.235
When he marries an Ethiopian woman and has to endure the acrimony of his sister Miriam and his brother Aaron, poor Miriam turns leprous as white as snow as a result of her exasperation, an appropriately ironic punishment for her bituperation against Moses' union with the black woman.

37:31.375 --> 37:49.996
And as we consider Moses, you will recall that the two tables of testimony were originally hewn by God himself, written with the finger of God, given to Moses by God to bring to his Hebrew people his covenant.

37:50.016 --> 37:56.883
But when Moses came down from the mountain with the tables, he found his people dancing and worshiping a golden calf.

37:56.903 --> 37:59.526
Indignant, angry, and hurt,

38:00.097 --> 38:03.660
Moses cast the tables out of his hands and broke them.

38:05.882 --> 38:09.926
Well, that didn't go down any too well.

38:09.946 --> 38:14.410
Moses felt that he had failed and wanted to be relieved of his commands, as it were.

38:15.511 --> 38:17.432
But God would have nothing to do with that.

38:18.193 --> 38:22.397
He told Moses that the journey to the promised land must continue.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.959
So Moses hewed the second set of tablets.

38:25.339 --> 38:28.382
Hewed them with his own hands this time.

38:28.767 --> 38:38.118
with mantis and chisel, and he hauled them up the cold, windy moraine of Sinai to have God ascribe them one more time.

38:40.581 --> 38:52.815
When he died, at 120 years, God himself buried Moses in a valley in the land of Moab in an unmarked and unknown settler.

38:52.835 --> 38:56.519
He died alone, and he was buried alone.

38:56.539 --> 38:57.340
Though here,

38:58.012 --> 39:09.365
through an image filched from Katie Kolovitz etching the downed crotton, an angel raves for Moses, as did the children of Israel.

39:09.385 --> 39:15.993
Now one could easily do 230 images of the Pentateuch alone.

39:16.013 --> 39:22.100
And I could complete all of my time here this afternoon by showing nothing but the images from that one section.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.145
Let's move on and look at two of the images from the books of the history.

39:26.446 --> 39:31.771
Look at Samson, for instance, slayer of lions and Philistine.

39:32.692 --> 39:35.715
He falls for the duplicitous Delilah.

39:36.356 --> 39:39.599
He gets drunk with her, makes love with her.

39:39.619 --> 39:45.565
And in his drunken passion, he discloses the secret of strength, then passes out.

39:46.967 --> 39:53.213
Delilah, who's been sipping tea or something, cuts off his hair.

39:54.104 --> 39:59.813
and delivers him into the hands of his enemies who blind him and throw him in prison.

39:59.833 --> 40:10.189
Then later on a feast day of the god Dagon, the Philistine bigwigs call Samson up out of prison to have a little sport with him.

40:10.209 --> 40:14.095
Turns out it wasn't a very good idea for the Philistines.

40:14.115 --> 40:20.365
Thousands of people were there drinking and singing and having a lecherous good old time.

40:21.340 --> 40:28.527
A boy is sent to fetch Samson, and when he does, Samson implores the boy to take him to the two pillars that support the temple.

40:29.809 --> 40:33.172
The lad does, and Samson asks, and I hope runs away.

40:35.154 --> 40:37.977
But it is at this moment that we see Samson.

40:38.998 --> 40:43.442
His hair has grown back, and his shoulders are starved from years under the whip.

40:44.684 --> 40:48.968
He is found with one of the two pillars and is about to find with the other.

40:49.960 --> 41:16.555
It is this moment before he sacrifices himself that I imagine Samson hesitates and then he says, O Lord God, remember me and strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.938
And he heaved with all of his might

41:19.778 --> 41:22.861
And the house fell upon all those that were there yet.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.406
Well, a lot of Philistines died that day.

41:28.207 --> 41:33.492
Three thousand were hanging out on the roof alone when the building came coming down.

41:35.194 --> 41:37.796
Samson died too, alone.

41:40.019 --> 41:45.364
And consider Erizba, a concubine of Saul who bore his two sons.

41:45.968 --> 41:58.323
Years later, when David is king, he discovered that Saul kills some neighboring Gibeonites, despite the existence of a covenant of friendship.

41:58.343 --> 42:11.979
The Gibeonites demanded a belated retaliation, and David, believing that the blood guilt had to be removed, ordered that seven Saul's sons be given over, including Rizpah and the two boys.

42:13.941 --> 42:14.642
They were hanged.

42:15.500 --> 42:29.661
and their grieving mother watched over them for a month or more, suffering neither the birds of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

42:29.681 --> 42:43.942
To read the Bible can be an extremely unpleasant experience sometimes because there is a lot of blood-led decapitations, murders, rapes, incest, you name it.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.304
The books of poetry

42:45.942 --> 42:54.414
offer opportunities of a different sort, specifically the occasion to use metaphors and similes.

42:54.434 --> 43:07.952
For instance, in the 34th Psalm, we read that the afflictions of the righteous are many, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

43:07.972 --> 43:10.836
For Bart Ryder, of course, was not a biblical issue.

43:11.609 --> 43:17.675
It was admitted in Decap, Illinois, in 1874.

43:17.795 --> 43:27.205
As I meditated on the affliction of the righteous, I remembered a line by Albert Camus in his essay, Return to Tukasa.

43:28.506 --> 43:33.411
He said that he was brought up surrounded by beauty, which was his only wealth.

43:34.352 --> 43:39.137
Then, he said, came the bar of the fire.

43:39.157 --> 43:41.599
I mean, tyranny's war

43:42.288 --> 43:45.210
police force.

43:45.230 --> 43:51.836
Well, since this is Jewish literature, it follows that the antecedents of the righteous are Jews.

43:53.337 --> 43:59.643
Thus, I have to ask what, then, would be the greatest affliction of the righteous?

43:59.663 --> 44:05.428
To me, a non-Jew in the 20th century, it must be, and only be, the Holocaust.

44:06.989 --> 44:11.873
And what better symbol of that unspeakable travesty than barbed wire?

44:12.747 --> 44:26.639
its incessant repetition of cruel, twisted bars, a cicado drumbeat of hellish swasticalite glosses.

44:26.659 --> 44:29.982
This is not my only reference to the Holocaust.

44:30.002 --> 44:40.070
For instance, this image is based on Zechariah 1.4, Turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings.

44:41.331 --> 44:42.332
Though they did not hear.

44:45.113 --> 44:50.241
Evil does not reside in acts alone.

44:50.261 --> 44:58.494
Evil does not live in Jasper, Texas, or Sylacauga, Alabama, or Laramie, Wyoming.

44:58.514 --> 45:04.783
Evil is not the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, nor the night of broken glass.

45:06.546 --> 45:13.737
Evil is what generates and spawns in those places and underlies those actions.

45:14.577 --> 45:23.645
arrogance, dogma, fear, hate, bigotry, ignorance, and territoriality.

45:23.665 --> 45:43.943
The murder of tens of millions of people in Europe in the 40s and the slaughter of the innocents in Bosnia, Guatemala, and Oklahoma City are the result of the actions of people who believe that they are right, believe that they know the mind of God, believe that their actions, no matter how heinous

45:44.615 --> 45:47.399
or justified.

45:47.419 --> 46:02.379
My meditation led me to the burning cross, a perverted symbol and one that is not entirely unrelated to the barbed wire or to the broken cross of the swastika.

46:02.399 --> 46:11.652
Perhaps in its perversion, the burning cross is a perfect and simple image for evil, and it resonates personally for me

46:12.037 --> 46:17.506
given that I come from a line of people who burn them, grandfather and apostle.

46:20.791 --> 46:24.197
And that brings me to the cross itself.

46:24.217 --> 46:35.074
There is a tradition in printing the English Bible that the New Testament be printed first, and I follow suit, but for pragmatic reasons, not symbolic.

46:35.797 --> 46:50.549
Since Christian theology holds that the Old Testament points to the New and is fulfilled by it, I, as illustrator, needed to be able to look ahead when it came time to image the Old Testament.

46:50.569 --> 46:54.252
I would need to know what it would be that I would be pointing to.

46:55.253 --> 47:00.558
The only way I could do that would be to do the New Testament first.

47:00.578 --> 47:05.702
So I began at the end and worked my way backwards to the beginning.

47:06.087 --> 47:11.352
Adam and Eve in the Garden was the last image I did completed on February 22, 1999.

47:14.355 --> 47:18.419
I began with the crucifixion summer 1996.

47:20.200 --> 47:27.948
It was for me then the most important and difficult image in the whole book and I wanted to get it done and out of the way.

47:29.309 --> 47:33.293
I wanted to be able to change my mind if I wanted to do it over again maybe.

47:33.695 --> 47:42.266
I followed a state course of action by doing it as a variation of the crucifixion I did for Dante's Paradiso in 1982.

47:43.348 --> 47:55.904
Doing so at that time, it seemed to me, was not so much an easy way out, which admittedly it was, as it was a beginning from where I left off.

47:55.924 --> 47:58.808
But restating an old composition nagged it.

47:59.632 --> 48:03.777
Not that I haven't restated old compositions before, because I have.

48:04.418 --> 48:06.841
Like Handel, I've done it a lot.

48:08.042 --> 48:11.426
And it wasn't because it was an incompetent image.

48:11.446 --> 48:18.194
It was interestingly composed, energetically executed, and had the essential elements of mystery and agony.

48:18.214 --> 48:24.662
But something wasn't right about my involvement, wasn't right about my attachment.

48:24.682 --> 48:26.584
That I was being cowardly,

48:27.104 --> 48:33.153
didn't occur to me right then, though now I think that was precisely the case.

48:34.475 --> 48:40.383
I engraved it anyway, put it aside, and moved on to the raising of Lazarus.

48:42.586 --> 48:53.702
But as I continued making my way through the four Gospels, I could not stop thinking that I had missed something important back there in my first confrontation with Golgotha.

48:55.387 --> 48:59.891
Then I gave a speech about the project at the University of Kansas.

48:59.911 --> 49:04.476
I showed slides of some of the finished images of the Annunciation.

49:09.401 --> 49:10.682
The death of John the Baptist.

49:15.366 --> 49:21.552
The agony in the garden.

49:21.572 --> 49:22.373
Agge homo.

49:25.120 --> 49:28.404
And then I projected a slide of the crucifixion.

49:31.327 --> 49:34.451
And I read the verse from Matthew that captions it.

49:35.151 --> 49:40.497
There were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand and another on the left.

49:40.517 --> 49:45.303
And them that passed by reviled him and wagged their head.

49:47.545 --> 49:54.233
Well, hearing myself read that text as I looked at my very safe image, a hundred times or more magnified,

49:54.736 --> 49:56.959
convinced me that I had to go back.

49:56.979 --> 50:03.129
I had to muster my courage and go back to Golgotha and start over again.

50:04.010 --> 50:06.614
Get involved personally.

50:06.634 --> 50:12.002
Get involved at the level where din and blood and dirt mingles.

50:13.045 --> 50:17.570
And I had to look at it hard, harder than I had done before.

50:18.171 --> 50:24.898
I had to be there, as the old DM asks, when they nailed him to the tree.

50:26.019 --> 50:29.864
Had to do something that was distinctly uncomfortable.

50:30.865 --> 50:36.471
Had to bring it to a human, common level, like Bruegel did.

50:37.227 --> 50:50.422
had to see it as a mother and child on the way to market might have seen it out of the corner of their eyes just passing by, not wanting to have anything to do with it.

50:50.442 --> 50:54.287
Perhaps they were repulsed by the blood and screams.

50:54.307 --> 50:56.029
Perhaps they hid their eyes.

50:56.630 --> 50:59.573
Perhaps the child asked, why, mama?

51:01.055 --> 51:02.697
And the mother couldn't answer.

51:03.559 --> 51:04.380
And they moved on.

51:05.381 --> 51:11.129
Needing to get by the mordacious crowd and go on with their lives.

51:11.570 --> 51:13.613
Go home and fix a dinner.

51:14.053 --> 51:15.075
Tell a story.

51:18.139 --> 51:19.901
Yet others didn't pass by.

51:20.763 --> 51:21.464
They stopped.

51:22.305 --> 51:23.487
Stopped and watched.

51:23.907 --> 51:26.451
Perhaps talked politics or religion.

51:27.292 --> 51:30.977
Laughed at the man hanging from the tree tree bleeding.

51:31.582 --> 51:39.713
clap their arms made in imitation of the crows that pecked at the eyes and living flesh of Christ of the two thieves.

51:40.814 --> 51:45.100
Maybe a vendor sold snacks, popcorn, and raisin nets.

51:46.602 --> 52:00.340
And then, of course, there were those who stayed because they loved the men, the men, and stayed to endure with them the indigo darkness that was about to overcome the moon.

52:01.366 --> 52:24.657
Their mournful sobs overwhelmed by the din of sniggering laughter, of sarcastic derisions, of the squawking of carrion birds, and the growling of feral dogs dickering over the blood reaching into the dirt.

52:27.202 --> 52:46.153
However, if one accepts the redemptive doctrine of the New Testament, one has to come to grips, it seems to me, with the fact that Jesus died for the atonement of the people who reviled him as much as he did for those who mourned and ate in their hearts for him.

52:48.396 --> 52:54.306
For me, the earlier comfortable composition did not say anything.

52:55.619 --> 53:16.227
To say what I needed to say, I had to abandon the usual graphic conventions of my image making, and I had to introduce jarring subject matter, like the courish, malicious crowd, eating and scorning with laughter, the dog, symbol of Rome and Goya,

53:16.477 --> 53:30.509
and a more complicated, resonating symbol when one considers that one of the causes of death by crucifixion was the loss of blood from having the lower legs torn open by scavenging dogs.

53:30.529 --> 53:42.719
And birds, the sounds of the birds, harbingers of death, who went first for the eyes, and there wasn't anything the poor bastard could do about it hanging there.

53:44.540 --> 53:46.382
Unless, like Rizvah,

53:46.885 --> 53:48.948
Somebody stayed behind with them all.

53:50.971 --> 53:59.282
Nasty stuff, this crucifying, and an image of it shouldn't be comfortable.

53:59.302 --> 54:05.810
To tell the story, the image had to be strident, discordant, and rude.

54:05.831 --> 54:16.605
And within that framework, Jesus is the one forsaken.

54:19.960 --> 54:36.037
Illustrating a Bible is a daunting undertaking, not so much having to do with the enormity of scale, though that too, as with engaging a sacred text.

54:37.418 --> 54:46.187
And vis-a-vis the King James Bible, it has to do with defronting what George Steiner has called the greatest monument of the English language.

54:47.180 --> 54:59.557
Having engaged this text, one then has to grapple with images that depict such sanctity and monumentality and has to wrestle with all the devils and angels that dwell within it.

55:00.639 --> 55:05.886
Moreover, one has to struggle with one's own arrogance.

55:05.906 --> 55:06.707
What light!

55:07.379 --> 55:20.081
Can anybody possibly bring to it today that Jerome, Aquinas, and Buber, Gruenwald, Rembrandt, and Chagall have not already brought to it?

55:20.101 --> 55:25.971
Beyond that, one must be up to the physical and intellectual rigors it requires.

55:25.991 --> 55:28.155
Long hours of study and reading

55:28.709 --> 55:37.340
long finger-numbing hours of work, ten, fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks in a year, three and a half years.

55:39.463 --> 55:47.813
And long and often frustrating hours attending to the myriad other details of bookmaking which you will hear more about today.

55:47.833 --> 55:54.902
But above all, one must be willing to risk and endure the inevitable failures and criticisms

55:55.439 --> 56:00.224
One must be willing, as the late Stanley Kubrick said, to look like an idiot.

56:02.607 --> 56:05.390
Sometimes I wonder if I should have taken it all.

56:06.391 --> 56:13.639
Not the work and labor, which I love and look forward to every day of my life, but the cup of the unknown.

56:14.640 --> 56:21.868
The cup that is filled with that which you tell me to do this work, filled with that

56:22.102 --> 56:27.792
unknown which I am afraid to admit to, afraid to call God.

56:51.143 --> 57:04.475
Yes, I thought it was the scheme name.

57:04.495 --> 57:08.865
The scheme name version is based on the screener edition, which is what the title is based on.

57:09.166 --> 57:20.092
And he, you were showing where the 15-11 was showing into words that were not as good as one of them.

57:20.112 --> 57:22.838
And most of you may probably have had that.

57:23.003 --> 57:42.183
It will spiritually get away with the challenges that we all come from, and we get away with all of these persons.

57:42.203 --> 57:43.445
But now, we're headed back to the matter of text two, I think.

57:43.465 --> 57:45.287
But then you have to be still back to the persons who are parasolized by the first numbers.

57:45.307 --> 57:45.787
There's 50 more numbers.

57:45.807 --> 57:46.168
They aren't there.

57:46.188 --> 57:46.648
That's a problem.

57:47.033 --> 57:51.335
My mouth is not weaponized.

57:51.355 --> 57:52.943
So it's kind of .

57:52.963 --> 57:54.511
It's not weaponized.

57:54.531 --> 57:54.994
It's not weaponized.

57:55.014 --> 57:55.677
It's not weaponized.

57:55.876 --> 58:04.570
It's an answer to that.

58:04.590 --> 58:11.241
That would be very cold.

58:11.261 --> 58:12.042
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:12.062 --> 58:12.844
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:12.864 --> 58:13.645
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:14.106 --> 58:15.328
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:15.348 --> 58:16.189
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:16.209 --> 58:16.990
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:17.010 --> 58:17.792
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:17.812 --> 58:18.593
I'm so happy you should have said that.

58:20.902 --> 58:25.932
Why am I able to face this book?

58:26.975 --> 58:28.919
Yeah, that image is John Baxter.

58:29.420 --> 58:31.624
Is that self-porting?

58:31.765 --> 58:38.519
No, actually, it's a friend of mine, Dennis Knowles, who will illustrate her children's books.

58:38.539 --> 58:41.164
Actually, that's a comedy-year book.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.066
Back as well.

58:42.046 --> 58:53.440
It's going to be in the Penelope Cashman book, but it won't be in the deluxe copies of Penelope Cashman, but it won't be in a trade edition without being done.

58:53.460 --> 58:54.941
I read it simply as St.

58:54.961 --> 58:59.166
Hamidman, the block for the first one that causes the very new material.

58:59.186 --> 59:02.010
Nobody's really ever worked with the material before.

59:02.030 --> 59:03.852
So that's the new name of the material called Red and the Great.

59:03.832 --> 59:14.372
It's a synthetic, actually plastic.

59:15.935 --> 59:21.286
It feels like goody-grady.

59:21.306 --> 59:22.107
I wasn't as confident.

59:22.127 --> 59:25.013
I didn't understand how it would be able to present as well.

59:25.718 --> 59:51.023
I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not really going to answer that.

59:51.043 --> 59:51.743
I don't know if it's all that long.

59:51.763 --> 59:52.224
So we'll take it later.

59:52.244 --> 59:54.426
We didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't.

59:55.418 --> 59:56.895
Is that good?

59:56.915 --> 59:58.999
Yeah, it's very sweet.
