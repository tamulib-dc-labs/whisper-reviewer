00:03.052 --> 00:12.968
Tom Crenn of the Getty Museum, let's put this close to you, and you were just saying that you're thinking about an exhibit on manuscripts?

00:12.988 --> 00:29.835
Yeah, the idea would be actually to go through the collection and pull out the manuscripts that come from great American collections, or great American collectors, in fact, or interesting American collections, and then, I mean, normally, in fact, we try to talk about the images and the decorations, but I thought it might be interesting for the public to actually realize

00:30.237 --> 00:43.633
Well, first place, I think, A, there's so few great collections of illuminated manuscripts in America that when they discover these things, I mean, most people don't even know illuminated manuscripts existed and understand that painted books in the Middle Ages was a great art form.

00:43.653 --> 00:52.344
And so, sort of as part of that educational process, I thought it would be interesting to point out that there were great, and there have been great, American collectors of illuminated books.

00:52.364 --> 00:53.084
Private collectors?

00:53.104 --> 00:53.885
Private collectors.

00:54.066 --> 00:57.730
And that, in fact, some of the great books in our collection come from these

00:58.030 --> 01:06.839
I mean, they were purchased, obviously, they weren't given, but nevertheless, they come from great American collectors, and there is a tradition.

01:06.859 --> 01:07.840
I think it's just not known.

01:07.860 --> 01:14.167
I mean, book collecting is one of the more low-profile, perhaps, collecting habits, I think.

01:14.187 --> 01:16.089
Maybe you, I don't know, I actually may have a different point of view on that.

01:16.129 --> 01:17.951
That was the essence of my piece in the New York Times.

01:17.971 --> 01:19.772
Did you see my Times piece?

01:20.053 --> 01:20.533
Actually, I did.

01:20.773 --> 01:27.160
But that was one of the thrusts there, is that while the art market has had a swoon in the last few months,

01:27.376 --> 01:28.297
Gets all the glamour.

01:28.397 --> 01:29.118
Gets all the glamour.

01:29.138 --> 01:33.463
Book collected is kind of steady, but nobody pays that much attention to it.

01:33.683 --> 01:33.984
Yeah.

01:34.004 --> 01:36.627
I mean, I think in the case of illuminated manuscripts, there are two reasons.

01:36.687 --> 01:37.808
One is the books aren't known.

01:37.828 --> 01:40.471
I mean, this is just my speculation.

01:41.552 --> 01:42.894
You know, it isn't even known.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.317
Illuminated manuscripts aren't known as an art form.

01:45.897 --> 01:50.643
And the other thing is books are small, and people, I think, look for physically large works of art.

01:50.663 --> 01:57.130
I mean, I think there's an American way of thinking or a modern way of thinking about museums that great works of art are large works of art.

01:57.278 --> 02:04.086
And in fact, we're doing a show on late medieval French manuscript illuminations.

02:04.727 --> 02:08.572
And in the 15th century in France, most of the manuscript illuminators were painters.

02:08.632 --> 02:10.915
They weren't separate professions.

02:10.935 --> 02:14.920
And so the painters to the king were also manuscript illuminators.

02:14.980 --> 02:26.374
And artists like Fouquet, who was one of the great 15th century French painters, probably illuminated many more manuscripts than he painted paintings and was perhaps as great or greater as a manuscript illuminator.

02:26.573 --> 02:35.206
So, in fact, in the Middle Ages, of course, this was a major art form, but my feeling is that people don't grasp that because the books are small.

02:35.226 --> 02:39.593
And somehow painting in a book today seems like a secondary thing.

02:39.713 --> 02:42.117
And it's often thought of, I think, as a minor art, but that's not true.

02:42.377 --> 02:43.599
It certainly wasn't in its own day.

02:43.819 --> 02:48.326
Certainly, you know, seeing the exhibits, I mean, it's a very unusual exhibit.

02:48.346 --> 02:50.209
You have the Bible on you.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.030
Right, exactly.

02:51.050 --> 02:55.517
Well, at a place like this where you are strong under ruminations, of course, you'd have these exhibits.

02:56.037 --> 02:59.942
You know, Morgan had a lovely one last year on it, that show, Illumination.

02:59.962 --> 03:00.703
That was a great show.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.285
That was a great show.

03:02.305 --> 03:05.169
But, you know, the blockbuster shows are painting shows.

03:05.409 --> 03:06.210
No, that's true.

03:06.390 --> 03:09.093
I'm hoping we will move into an era of blockbuster manuscripts.

03:09.674 --> 03:12.137
They've shown most of the paintings that we've shown, I think.

03:12.157 --> 03:12.978
Well, it could happen.

03:13.219 --> 03:24.593
I think the thing is, also, most of the great collections of Illumination manuscripts are libraries, and libraries exhibit, but they don't exhibit in the way, they don't, their exhibiting function is much, is a much lower priority than in a museum.

03:24.995 --> 03:27.919
And therefore, there is not the great tradition of showing manuscripts.

03:27.979 --> 03:32.886
In fact, we show our manuscripts probably more, especially for the size of the collection.

03:32.926 --> 03:34.568
It's a very small collection.

03:34.588 --> 03:37.973
We show manuscripts much more often than most other institutions.

03:38.013 --> 03:42.279
I mean, the Morgan Library's collection is five or six times the size of our collection.

03:42.299 --> 03:45.083
But in fact, they don't necessarily have a show all year round.

03:45.504 --> 03:48.668
But we do four shows a year that last for about 10 or 12 weeks.

03:49.169 --> 03:53.635
And so there's always something on view because we treat them in a sense

03:53.851 --> 04:00.498
You know, we fall somewhere between a work of art and a book, in terms of simplest categories, and we treat them as works of art.

04:00.678 --> 04:09.968
So we feel we have an obligation to the public to always have something on display, and at least have a collection of some of the great things in the collection on display, because they come here to see works of art.

04:10.188 --> 04:12.210
So we're not a library.

04:12.230 --> 04:15.754
I mean, the Center has its library and its collections, and it's a different kind of collection.

04:17.155 --> 04:19.178
That doesn't mean we don't make stuff available to scholars.

04:19.198 --> 04:21.580
I have this fellow out here.

04:21.948 --> 04:27.576
Professor Rowe, who's an anthropologist, we happen to have one great South American manuscript, and he's working on it.

04:27.596 --> 04:34.026
So we have scholars come all the time to use the collection, and we supply photographs and microfilms and whatever we can to help people publish things.

04:34.767 --> 04:38.753
And we are publishing, we've done, we've supported various kinds of publications like this too.

04:39.153 --> 04:43.720
But our function, I think my primary goal is to show great works of life to the public.

04:44.138 --> 04:45.419
I'm an art guy.

04:45.439 --> 04:48.923
You have a reading room, per se, where you bring out the manuscripts.

04:48.943 --> 04:49.664
Well, we do, actually.

04:49.704 --> 04:54.970
This room here, it just happens to be rather small and cramped because the collections have gone so fast.

04:55.291 --> 04:58.094
And you do allow them access to the actual documents?

04:58.114 --> 04:59.395
Yep, he's looking at the manuscript now.

04:59.656 --> 05:00.637
He is.

05:00.657 --> 05:01.858
So, yeah, no, no, we do.

05:01.878 --> 05:03.300
I mean, you have to be a qualified scholar.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.602
You can't let sort of the man off the street look.

05:05.622 --> 05:06.604
No, I understand that.

05:06.624 --> 05:07.885
But we do allow...

05:08.422 --> 05:14.250
I have a couple books that we restrict access just because they're so fragile, and for one reason or another, you simply don't.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.213
You can't take the risk.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.556
I mean, books are fragile because they have to be handled.

05:18.956 --> 05:31.293
A painting, you can always move it around by the frame, but in the end, a book, you have to sort of turn the pages, and every time you handle a book, you change its color, as it were, because some humans rub songs.

05:31.834 --> 05:36.420
That is the focus here, though, that the artifact is

05:36.755 --> 05:40.580
as a work of art, as opposed to a book.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.141
Exactly.

05:41.281 --> 05:48.090
And so content is basically irrelevant, not irrelevant, but secondary.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.292
It's not irrelevant, but secondary.

05:49.312 --> 05:49.773
Exactly.

05:50.053 --> 05:57.984
I mean, in fact, the fact that we're called the Department of Manuscripts is a bit of a misnomer, because our goal is to represent the history of the art of manuscript illumination.

05:58.084 --> 06:00.387
I mean, it's really a collection of illumination, if you like.

06:01.188 --> 06:06.255
And we're trying to represent the great schools, the great artists,

06:06.505 --> 06:11.350
We are trying to represent, to some extent, the great texts that were illuminated insofar as it's possible.

06:11.491 --> 06:13.973
We have actually a rather good collection of illuminated babels.

06:15.115 --> 06:21.802
We just brought in a couple of miniatures which illuminated the Boethius manuscript.

06:22.223 --> 06:26.588
In Boethius, the Consolation of Thasby, was the most popular book in the Middle Ages after the Babel.

06:27.449 --> 06:31.433
And in the 15th century, for example, it was incredibly popular, and there were lots of illuminated copies.

06:31.919 --> 06:42.069
So we do actually, it's not a primary goal, but we want to have a representative collection, the same way you aim to have a representative drawings collection or a representative paintings collection.

06:42.449 --> 06:46.293
We want to be able to tell the story of the history of manuscript delimination.

06:46.313 --> 06:49.436
It's a great history, I mean, it lasted for whatever, 12 centuries.

06:52.219 --> 07:00.947
Just to, for a moment, if you could just give me a little bit about yourself, how long you've been here, and how long you've been actively working in manuscripts, a little background of yourself, if you could.

07:01.602 --> 07:07.287
Well, I've been here since 1980, actually 11 years and a couple weeks, a long time.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.850
And I came as the associate curator of paintings.

07:10.190 --> 07:16.876
And when I came in 1980, there were only three collections, which were French Decadive Arts Antiquities and Old Master Paintings.

07:17.477 --> 07:29.888
And although Getty had died and the will had been read and it was clear that the money was going to the museum when I was hired, in fact, it was another year and a half before we went through the courts and the estate was finally settled, so we didn't start buying for one.

07:30.222 --> 07:43.495
And then, actually fairly quickly, in the summer of 82, Krauss, a representative from Krauss, his daughter, came to visit us with Jake Zeitlin and wanted to talk about some manuscripts, and it was all rather vague.

07:44.175 --> 07:51.522
But I was in the associate curator of paintings, and my boss knew that I knew about manuscripts because I'd written a master's thesis at Yale on manuscript illumination.

07:51.562 --> 07:57.748
And I'd, actually, I'd been organizing an exhibition, and I'd, in the meantime, also been organizing an exhibition about manuscripts.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.745
So he knew that I was like the one person.

07:59.905 --> 08:03.049
There were only three curators in the museum and one associate curator.

08:03.069 --> 08:07.314
It was really a small mom-and-pop show in those days, practically.

08:07.974 --> 08:12.039
And so I was actually in this fortunate position that I knew about manuscripts and any of these people were coming, so fine.

08:12.119 --> 08:13.020
So I went along to the meeting.

08:13.521 --> 08:22.671
And they pulled out the first catalog, first volume, I think it was, of this.

08:23.832 --> 08:24.673
We're going to see how it looks like that.

08:24.693 --> 08:25.274
And actually, there was this.

08:25.294 --> 08:26.115
Did this post that?

08:27.597 --> 08:29.279
This is kind of an interesting story.

08:29.299 --> 08:30.079
Yeah, 79.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.581
So this had been published already.

08:32.782 --> 08:34.604
That's a catalog of the Ludwig collection.

08:34.624 --> 08:35.965
Yeah, that's a catalog of the Ludwig collection.

08:35.985 --> 08:39.109
And there were these prospectuses of the other volumes which were yet to be published.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.510
This is actually one of the books.

08:40.530 --> 08:44.574
These are the books that Mary Ann brought on that day to the gate.

08:44.594 --> 08:45.215
Mary Ann Crouch.

08:46.015 --> 08:46.216
Yeah.

08:46.476 --> 08:51.921
And... What did you think?

08:51.941 --> 08:55.545
Well, the thing was, I knew a little about it, because this is kind of a... This story is...

08:55.880 --> 08:58.904
is discussed in, you know, circles.

08:59.965 --> 09:01.026
Oh, yeah.

09:01.046 --> 09:02.508
I mean, it was terrific for me.

09:02.588 --> 09:06.733
I'm just stating it, of course, as you know, but I mean, it's a very interesting story.

09:07.093 --> 09:25.836
Yeah, the thing was I knew the collection because it had terrific Flemish manuscripts, and since I'd written my Master's Thesis on Flemish Manuscript Illumination, I'd never seen it, but I knew of some of the great books, and I knew in the mid-'70s they bought at sale a completely unknown Flemish manuscript, which has turned out to be one of the

09:26.052 --> 09:30.297
one of the greatest and most important of all, which is called the Spinola Hours, which we can look at that later.

09:31.578 --> 09:32.159
So it's very well.

09:32.219 --> 09:40.427
I mean, when they walked in and said, set the stuff down and said, well, we represent this collector named Ludwig, and he's interested in selling this collection, I mean, I was completely flabbergasted.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.411
You didn't know what this meeting was about when you walked in?

09:43.431 --> 09:44.372
Well, no, I didn't.

09:44.392 --> 09:44.872
I didn't know that.

09:44.892 --> 09:46.574
I mean, obviously it was about acquisition of something.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.317
They assumed, my boss assumed it had something to do with manuscripts.

09:50.038 --> 09:51.439
They just said they wanted to come and see us.

09:52.701 --> 09:55.924
And only at sort of at the meeting did I find out what was going on.

09:56.157 --> 09:57.860
And you said you were flabbergasted.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.304
Yeah, well, yeah, it was, because it was a great, great collection.

10:00.625 --> 10:07.998
And I had actually, we all realized that, in the first place, it was an enormous amount of money that was coming to the museum.

10:08.559 --> 10:19.178
And collecting in only three areas, there had always been a certain amount of talk about what else the museum could do besides collecting paintings and French furniture and antiquities and so on.

10:19.462 --> 10:27.491
gone a couple of times on my trips to Europe in the meantime to visit the manuscripts people at Sotheby's to see if there was anything terrific coming up in a sale, and perhaps maybe.

10:27.991 --> 10:33.097
So I sort of held out this vague hope that maybe a terrific manuscript would come along someday.

10:33.117 --> 10:34.919
We might buy one great manuscript.

10:34.939 --> 10:37.582
But I never really imagined that we would have an opportunity like this.

10:38.403 --> 10:47.713
So basically what happened was that I was asked to go over and see the stuff, which I happily did, and I spent about a week

10:48.183 --> 10:54.350
Half of it was in Cologne, and I spent a week in Aachen at the Ludwig's house looking at things in the library.

10:54.730 --> 10:59.075
And they just brought in one manuscript after another, and I went through them page by page, actually.

10:59.476 --> 11:00.257
That was very exciting.

11:00.277 --> 11:01.538
Yeah, it was fun, actually.

11:01.558 --> 11:02.219
And then I went.

11:03.260 --> 11:09.387
Then the other half were kept in Switzerland, and I went to Zurich and sat in the bank vault for another three or four days and looked through the rest of them.

11:09.907 --> 11:13.131
And it was quite a—it was a peak experience, I think.

11:13.151 --> 11:17.616
Were they selling because it was time, or was it particularly smart?

11:17.782 --> 11:34.829
There was an official public statement about that they were selling, I think it—I could perhaps even dig it out, but I think that there was—he said he was going to start a foundation for our historical research, and that he was raising money to establish this foundation to further research or something.

11:35.290 --> 11:37.173
And I don't actually know what ever came of that.

11:37.753 --> 11:45.105
I mean, off the record— If you say off the record, it's off the record.

11:45.997 --> 11:49.405
I think, actually, he was this big chocolate manufacturer.

11:50.508 --> 11:55.279
And my impression is that those factories were already declining, though, and that there was a serious cash flow problem.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.104
That was the motivation.

11:57.184 --> 12:02.757
And eventually, if you sort of do some digging through the newspapers, I think

12:03.007 --> 12:06.190
most of his chocolate interests were sold in the last four or five years.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.773
I mean, if I find this, I'll believe it.

12:08.793 --> 12:09.574
Yeah, okay.

12:09.594 --> 12:10.955
I don't really see it as that big a deal.

12:11.055 --> 12:31.596
Well, except it's an interesting story, but I think he did sell, I mean, there was an official reason, and there was a press release that he was selling for these, because he was going to use the money to further, because he is a great philanthropist in the sense that he has created collections, which he's planted in museums all over the world, and I mean, he's an interesting... He's the kind of person that I'm... Yeah, he's absolutely one of the great collectors of the 20th century.

12:31.913 --> 12:37.902
And he's interesting because he builds collections so that, in a sense, he can plant them in one institution or another and put his name on them.

12:37.922 --> 12:48.339
So there, you know, in Aachen, I guess, the Sermont Museum, which is a collection mostly in medieval art, is now called the Sermont Ludwig Museum, and it contains his collection of medieval sculpture.

12:49.200 --> 12:55.851
There's the Ludwig Museum in Cologne now, which is part of this complex of museums in the center of the city near the train station.

12:56.231 --> 12:59.997
And some of the great objects in that museum are from Ludwig.

13:00.078 --> 13:02.942
He had, I think, one of the greatest collections of American pop painting.

13:03.563 --> 13:03.703
Really?

13:03.723 --> 13:03.823
Yeah.

13:04.043 --> 13:10.732
Actually, one of the interesting stories about the manuscripts is he started buying in 58, somewhere in the late 60s.

13:10.772 --> 13:12.795
And you can find the answer to this in Krauss's book.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.756
He gives the time.

13:14.357 --> 13:17.281
Ludwig wanted to raise some money to buy American pop art.

13:17.301 --> 13:19.083
He decided he was going to go into this area.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.027
So he took some of his best manuscripts and sold them back to Krauss.

13:23.249 --> 13:28.836
And six or eight years later, or some period of time later, when he had money again, after he bought all the American pop art,

13:29.018 --> 13:35.428
He brought back from Krauss most of those manuscripts, the things that Krauss hadn't sold in the meantime.

13:36.209 --> 13:39.534
So then, in fact, Ludwig bought a number of the great things in the collection twice from Krauss.

13:40.055 --> 13:43.561
And since Krauss sold them to us, Krauss actually handled some of these manuscripts three times.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.105
He did very well.

13:46.205 --> 13:50.291
They don't like to be called dealers, but they are.

13:50.311 --> 13:50.812
No, no, no.

13:50.932 --> 13:51.874
He was an amazing dealer.

13:51.934 --> 13:55.359
He was very proud of the fact that he did very well.

13:55.479 --> 13:57.102
I'm surprised.

13:57.740 --> 14:04.307
You know, if you want to buy something of that magnitude from Great Britain, I mean, you go, that stuff doesn't leave the country these days.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.650
I'm surprised they allow that stuff to leave.

14:06.830 --> 14:07.751
Well, that's interesting.

14:07.771 --> 14:10.414
You know, every European country has a different kind of export law.

14:10.474 --> 14:14.278
And in Germany, the law is always based on what is called the list.

14:14.298 --> 14:18.322
And there's actually a list of works of art in Germany that cannot be exported.

14:18.763 --> 14:21.325
And, I mean, it's a finite thing.

14:21.626 --> 14:24.509
And there were, none of these objects were on the list.

14:24.889 --> 14:26.631
And it's as simple as that.

14:26.651 --> 14:27.392
And I think...

14:27.777 --> 14:42.650
A certain number of ... Well, again, I think this is something that I should say off the record, but it's worth reporting on some level, is that he probably kept a certain number of things in Switzerland to make sure that they never got on the list, so to sense.

14:43.431 --> 14:44.112
They're not in Germany.

14:44.152 --> 14:45.513
The Germans can't do anything about them.

14:45.913 --> 14:50.277
And I could go back to my notes and see which ones were kept in Germany.

14:50.337 --> 14:52.159
It's been so long, I don't remember them all.

14:52.539 --> 14:55.742
But the fact is that he wasn't unaware

14:55.992 --> 14:58.215
you know, that maybe the laws could change or something like that.

14:58.715 --> 15:08.166
I think the issue that we faced, which was a difficult issue, was the, it was clear that these catalogs were being paid for by the city of Cologne.

15:08.566 --> 15:16.976
And I had understood, I mean, the one thing that, one of the reasons that I was surprised to have them offered was I had understood that this was a collection that he was giving to the city of Cologne.

15:18.758 --> 15:22.422
And so, at first I actually thought

15:22.638 --> 15:26.543
They were playing a kind of a game with us, and for some reason, they were trying to go back.

15:26.843 --> 15:41.221
They were going to find us, try to get us interested in the collection, and then maybe go back to the city of Cologne for some reason to see if they can get better concessions, because, you know, Ludwig would get, one of his things is he would get, I guess, someone, he'd give a collection, but you had to build a building for it or something like that.

15:41.241 --> 15:45.667
So maybe I thought there was some kind, we were being used as a pawn in some kind of political bartering.

15:46.548 --> 15:48.190
So we sort of actually moved in it.

15:48.946 --> 15:50.668
I mean, I was incredibly enthusiastic.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.329
I mean, it was a great, great opportunity for us.

15:52.349 --> 15:58.535
But at the same time, we wanted, we looked at the situation very, very carefully.

15:58.556 --> 15:59.056
We wanted that.

15:59.076 --> 16:02.499
We absolutely tried to be incredibly careful that we don't do anything that's illegal.

16:04.902 --> 16:08.846
There was a complicated set of, you know, there are other issues here, kind of moral issues, if you like.

16:09.406 --> 16:13.851
But it became very, very clear after a while that, from dealing with him, that he needed to sell them.

16:14.011 --> 16:17.094
For whatever reason, he was eager to raise a certain amount of money.

16:17.154 --> 16:18.295
This was very, very clear.

16:18.511 --> 16:25.601
It was obvious to me at a certain point that there was no way that Cologne and the German government was likely to turn around and buy this collection.

16:25.621 --> 16:30.347
So I didn't feel in a sense that, if anything, we were probably saving the collection from being broken up.

16:31.389 --> 16:42.864
And the other thing is from my point of view, I mean, about all of this is when it goes from a private collection to a public collection, it becomes much, much more accessible to scholars and the public in the whole world.

16:43.345 --> 16:47.050
And in fact, these objects have probably been displayed

16:47.570 --> 16:52.336
better and more often in the last ten years than they have in their entire previous history, and more people have had a chance to see them.

16:52.436 --> 16:53.978
And they're being taken care of.

16:53.998 --> 16:56.421
They're in a safe place.

16:56.801 --> 16:59.344
You know they're going to be well taken care of here.

16:59.364 --> 16:59.525
Right.

16:59.545 --> 17:06.493
In fairness, I mean, I think Ludwig took good care of them too, but I think we make them available in a way that an institution can.

17:06.613 --> 17:12.220
But at least that they know the new home is certainly going to be at least as good as the old home.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.125
Well, the fun part of being a curator is making great things available to the widest possible audience.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.257
And that's one part of the job.

17:18.277 --> 17:21.841
Were you involved in the numbers?

17:21.921 --> 17:26.906
I mean, I know the number, and I don't want to get you into that, but were you involved in those negotiations?

17:27.667 --> 17:29.329
My job was to value the collection.

17:29.569 --> 17:31.691
And the way I did it is I did it object by object.

17:31.911 --> 17:38.278
I literally did research on each object and tried to figure out what I thought the fair market buy of each object was.

17:38.558 --> 17:44.104
And we told it up, and we rounded it off to the nearest million or whatever.

17:44.405 --> 17:49.169
or half million or something, and because it was 143 objects, it was a lot.

17:49.209 --> 17:59.339
And I simply went to the president, at that point, this was before John Walsh was hired, the place was sort of really being run by Harold Williams.

17:59.359 --> 18:04.824
And I basically said, you know, this is a great collection, and this is what it means art historically, and so on.

18:05.284 --> 18:09.128
This is what I think it's worth in the market today.

18:09.148 --> 18:11.830
And then he took that figure

18:12.130 --> 18:13.933
And he actually did the negotiating.

18:13.953 --> 18:14.594
And there was a period.

18:14.614 --> 18:17.759
It was an interesting negotiation because it fell apart completely at one point.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.625
The figure that I recommended was about half of what the asking price was.

18:21.645 --> 18:23.068
It was an enormous disparity.

18:23.188 --> 18:23.488
Really?

18:23.829 --> 18:27.194
And I think that that was found to be rather disconcerting.

18:28.036 --> 18:30.620
And so things didn't move very far.

18:31.441 --> 18:38.813
And I think probably, I mean, I have to ask Carol about this, but I suspect he probably thought this is what they were worth and this is what we should pay.

18:39.451 --> 18:52.349
Eventually, what happened was that Jake Zeitlin, although Klaus always gets the credit for this deal, there seems to be some kind of an arrangement with book dealers where if a book dealer moves into someone else's territory, he brings in a book dealer or the leading book dealer from that area.

18:52.469 --> 18:55.253
This is kind of in Zeitlin's oral history, by the way.

18:55.273 --> 18:55.613
Oh, it is?

18:55.713 --> 18:56.094
Okay.

18:56.114 --> 18:57.275
Yeah, interesting.

18:57.496 --> 18:58.137
It's true.

18:58.417 --> 18:58.778
You're right.

18:58.798 --> 19:03.564
Yeah, I mention it because at the time, I didn't actually realize what Zeitlin's role was at all, and I found out about this later.

19:03.925 --> 19:08.631
But apparently, actually, Zeitlin himself realized that things were going badly, and he thought,

19:08.915 --> 19:15.304
He knew that Ludwig wanted to sell, and he apparently went back to Ludwig and said, look, if you'll make a significant decline on the price, things will start moving again.

19:16.505 --> 19:19.970
I mean, again, you may know the story better than I do, but that's what Jake eventually told me.

19:20.671 --> 19:23.274
And then, in fact, that's what happened.

19:23.314 --> 19:34.710
In fact, I think that Ludwig came back to Harold, and then Harold felt like he was more in a negotiating ballpark, and it went back and forth and back and forth, and eventually he put together what I think was an amazing deal.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.272
He got better terms than I had recommended.

19:36.753 --> 19:37.053
Really?

19:37.674 --> 19:37.774
Yeah.

19:38.142 --> 19:40.665
Significantly better terms than I'd recommend.

19:40.685 --> 19:43.167
Terms in terms of time or in terms of numbers?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.492
Well, let me ask it this way.

19:47.712 --> 19:52.877
I find a piece of paper that said I never reveal the... No, no, then let's leave it alone, because I don't think it's there.

19:53.598 --> 19:54.599
There's a lot of difference.

19:54.659 --> 20:03.008
I've never heard anyone actually give... The terms are complicated, and I've never heard anyone... Many people have said, oh, it costs so much, but no one has ever gotten the whole story right.

20:03.028 --> 20:03.949
And who needs it?

20:04.430 --> 20:07.693
It's an interesting story, conceptually, that we need that.

20:08.011 --> 20:19.165
We might make an inquiry since it happened so many years ago, but I was asked in any case now.

20:19.506 --> 20:32.282
But anyway, I think actually, for what it's worth, I mean, I think we did get a very favorable deal, and given the direction in which the market has moved since then, the collection is worth, you know, many times what we paid for it, I think.

20:32.362 --> 20:36.668
I think the significance of it, though, beyond the numbers, of course, which is interesting,

20:37.238 --> 20:42.083
but more significantly, with that one acquisition, you became a major.

20:42.364 --> 20:45.047
You created a manuscript department.

20:45.067 --> 20:46.528
Yeah, that was the exciting part.

20:46.588 --> 20:47.890
Let's talk a little bit about that.

20:47.950 --> 20:52.195
Overnight, you became, you changed jobs, so to speak, or you added responsibilities.

20:52.695 --> 21:00.984
Yeah, well, actually, the way they did it, actually, was rather, in the sort of typical Getty way, I was given the option of applying for the job to run the department.

21:02.086 --> 21:06.891
And, in fact, they did sort of conduct a search and interview people from all over, I gather,

21:07.242 --> 21:08.684
And eventually, I did get the job.

21:08.704 --> 21:09.224
I took them away.

21:09.244 --> 21:11.247
They actually did sort of do a thorough search for a year.

21:12.868 --> 21:18.715
So, I mean, if nothing else, it made me feel like I'd sort of stood up against the competition in the meantime.

21:18.735 --> 21:24.261
And the other thing they did, which was rather sneaky, was they waited a year to—actually, it wasn't sneaky.

21:24.341 --> 21:25.343
It was perfectly reasonable.

21:25.363 --> 21:29.267
I think they were themselves in a bit of a state of shock that they had actually gone ahead

21:29.534 --> 21:31.717
and done something like this, because again, this was back in 1983.

21:31.777 --> 21:33.639
There were still only three collections.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.363
This was the first time we'd made a major move into a new collection.

21:36.583 --> 21:42.010
It really was an enormous amount of money for any institution to pay, because it was far more than buying an expensive painting.

21:42.151 --> 21:45.555
I mean, it was buying 140 terrific objects.

21:45.575 --> 21:51.643
And so they said, actually, fine, you have your 143 manuscripts now lay off.

21:52.147 --> 21:57.152
And I, in fact, was still in the thanks department, and I ended up clearly buying a lot of other pictures and stuff.

21:57.172 --> 22:00.155
So I went back for about a year to be much more involved than now.

22:00.775 --> 22:06.921
In fact, we also agreed, because we didn't have a staff.

22:06.941 --> 22:07.462
It was just me.

22:07.582 --> 22:08.342
I had an assistant.

22:09.504 --> 22:11.846
But there was no way I could start making the books available to people.

22:11.866 --> 22:13.427
There was no way we could exhibit them right away.

22:13.708 --> 22:21.495
We needed to figure out how to store them properly, how to make a facility for scholars to come and look at them, how to exhibit them in a way that was safe for them.

22:21.796 --> 22:26.481
And so we just decided, we actually took them and locked them up for about nine months.

22:26.741 --> 22:32.286
And we waited, it was almost a year before we actually exhibited them, because we wanted to make sure we had the proper kinds of cases and all that.

22:33.027 --> 22:35.249
And we wanted to have a proper storage facility.

22:36.490 --> 22:41.756
And that in itself, the sort of mechanics of curatorial work of setting up the department are pretty labor intensive.

22:42.076 --> 22:43.717
And we did a lot of research.

22:43.757 --> 22:49.583
We brought in consultants, people who knew better about manuscripts conservation than I did, and got the best advice we could.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.465
It was an interesting time.

22:51.968 --> 22:56.893
And we also started the arduous task of recording and describing these manuscripts for our records.

23:01.418 --> 23:07.325
So you essentially started the collection with these 140 manuscripts, right?

23:07.345 --> 23:07.445
Yeah.

23:07.465 --> 23:15.974
And at numbers now, I think we've... About 180, I think.

23:16.615 --> 23:17.275
Close to 190.

23:17.335 --> 23:18.837
So really, that's the core collection, right?

23:19.458 --> 23:20.880
Yeah, it is the core collection.

23:21.161 --> 23:29.575
There were a group of text manuscripts that actually were interesting manuscripts, but I think the money could be used to buy more illuminated manuscripts.

23:29.595 --> 23:32.700
So we sold about eight items from the library collection.

23:32.720 --> 23:38.189
So there are about 135 of the library manuscripts, and then maybe 43 other things since then.

23:38.209 --> 23:38.990
So that's about 100, yeah.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.172
Yeah, it's the core collection.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.137
So you really haven't been on a wild screen since then?

23:43.927 --> 23:47.171
No, I could have easily spent more money than I did.

23:48.032 --> 23:52.457
There were more terrific things out there than we've had money for.

23:52.477 --> 23:53.999
That's for sure.

23:54.079 --> 23:56.002
I don't have an unlimited budget, and I never did.

23:56.022 --> 24:11.841
And I do try to hold back to buy things that are really terrific, which means sometimes buying... In essence, I bought things once every year and a half or so simply because things are so expensive.

24:12.074 --> 24:13.857
You know, great things are terribly expensive.

24:13.877 --> 24:16.641
There was just this bestiary sold in December for $6 million.

24:17.082 --> 24:19.125
I mean, actually, I did on it, but I wasn't even close.

24:19.145 --> 24:19.986
I just didn't have the money.

24:20.326 --> 24:21.368
Where was it?

24:21.588 --> 24:22.530
It was in New York.

24:22.650 --> 24:25.013
It was a sale in London at Sotheby's.

24:25.033 --> 24:28.619
Most of the great illuminated manuscript sales were at Sotheby's in London.

24:28.659 --> 24:31.924
Occasionally, there are others, but those are the most important ones.

24:32.365 --> 24:40.697
Let's go back to something you said at the beginning, when you're thinking about doing a show about illuminated manuscripts that come out of

24:41.825 --> 24:44.048
of the collections of art collectors.

24:45.510 --> 24:51.699
Could you tell me who some of these collectors are and how these items happen to get into their collections, and how do you think they happen?

24:51.719 --> 25:08.203
Well, actually, yeah, I'm thinking more of the great book collectors who collected illuminated manuscripts, like we have manuscripts, collectors you'll know, like Robert Ho and Courtland Bishop and the Astor Collection, which originally, the collection started to be built when Astor was still an American family before it became a British family.

25:09.398 --> 25:10.660
What else do we have?

25:10.680 --> 25:11.862
We only have Beatty manuscripts.

25:11.882 --> 25:13.183
Beatty was an American after all.

25:14.085 --> 25:25.641
And perhaps for us the most important was Philip Hofer, because we bought five manuscripts that Hofer had found at one time or another.

25:26.342 --> 25:27.404
And you must know.

25:27.464 --> 25:28.165
Of course, yeah.

25:28.566 --> 25:35.556
Well, the interesting thing is, most of his printed books went to Harvard, but he never intended for the illuminated manuscripts.

25:35.596 --> 25:37.178
He gave a couple of illuminated things.

25:37.630 --> 25:44.561
He actually gave some illuminated things to Harvard, I gather, but a number of the greatest things he never intended for them to have, although he gave them.

25:44.581 --> 25:50.911
I mean, he was incredibly generous with them, but for whatever reason, had never intended to give them.

25:50.931 --> 26:00.166
So these, you have acquired in the normal process, and it just happens that a number of them have pretty interesting associations.

26:00.186 --> 26:00.286
Yeah.

26:00.306 --> 26:04.212
Now, do you think that these collectors collected them as art objects?

26:05.221 --> 26:07.264
Each collector, I suppose, is different.

26:07.284 --> 26:11.089
Well, Beatty was a great collector of illuminated manuscripts.

26:11.930 --> 26:16.857
Um, Hofer, yes, Hofer was a great connoisseur.

26:16.877 --> 26:18.439
I mean, he collected beautiful books.

26:18.459 --> 26:23.066
I mean, he was a beautiful art, but he had an amazing taste, and he collected other kinds of art objects.

26:23.086 --> 26:25.850
So he was one of these people who was an art collector, book collector.

26:26.050 --> 26:31.718
Now, there are different kinds of book collectors, and there are those who are more

26:32.491 --> 26:40.318
text-oriented in a sense, I don't know, sort of postage stamp-oriented in the sense of getting one of these and one of those.

26:40.378 --> 26:48.926
And there are others who I think collect more for the beauty and perfection of, I mean, even for books that aren't necessarily illustrated books, for great printing or whatever.

26:48.946 --> 26:56.453
I mean, there are great copies, there are beautiful, aesthetically wonderful copies, and there are copies that are representative but may be nicked up and may be not so perfect and so on.

26:56.473 --> 26:59.075
So they're different, you know, they're different kinds of collectors.

27:00.136 --> 27:02.498
But I think Hofer was one who collected the great object.

27:03.490 --> 27:10.859
If you aren't in the process now of adding vigorously to the collection, do you nevertheless have goals?

27:10.939 --> 27:13.322
I mean, do you have a focus for it?

27:13.342 --> 27:13.662
Oh, absolutely.

27:14.163 --> 27:16.526
Well, I mean, the thing is, where would you like to go with it?

27:18.148 --> 27:20.931
Well, frankly, I'd like to be as big and large and fine as we can be.

27:20.971 --> 27:24.976
I mean, again, we're trying to make a collection that is representative.

27:25.036 --> 27:28.620
I mean, we're trying to represent most of the great schools and most of the great periods.

27:28.988 --> 27:30.490
where it's possible to great artists.

27:31.292 --> 27:34.737
For example, and to some extent, we're subject to what is available.

27:34.938 --> 27:43.752
It's even a later stage, in a sense, collecting illuminated manuscripts than it is, say, old master paintings, because there's just not that much really great material that's left.

27:43.772 --> 27:53.046
And if you look at the things we've bought in the last ten, well, whatever it is, eight years now or seven years, it's mostly late medieval stuff, because there are terrific late medieval things left.

27:53.848 --> 27:56.532
We bought one great tenth-century manuscript, but

27:57.220 --> 28:00.885
nothing before then, and actually not a lot from the 11th throughout the 13th centuries.

28:00.905 --> 28:03.629
There's simply not that much really terrific material.

28:03.789 --> 28:06.012
And we're trying, we're working on it, and we're chasing things.

28:07.113 --> 28:15.044
That's very important, and I think that was mentioned by one of the pieces that you sent me, one of the news articles you sent me there.

28:15.064 --> 28:21.172
What you did by acquiring the Ludwig Collection is to do something that really nobody else could do, even if they had the funds.

28:21.212 --> 28:25.017
That did give you an opportunity to become a major player.

28:25.418 --> 28:29.143
At a time, it was probably considered impossible to do so for any institution.

28:29.163 --> 28:29.924
Yeah, I think that's right.

28:29.944 --> 28:30.825
Is that a fair assessment?

28:30.885 --> 28:37.853
Yeah, because as I said, I'd always hoped that maybe we'd buy a great illuminated manuscript, but I never imagined that we'd ever have a significant collection.

28:37.873 --> 28:39.475
It just seemed like it was too late in the game.

28:39.876 --> 28:41.318
So the Ludwig, yeah, I think that's right.

28:41.338 --> 28:43.380
The Ludwig Collection made that level of difference.

28:43.921 --> 28:45.623
But there's still terrific things you can add to it.

28:45.723 --> 28:53.012
For example, for whatever reason, he was particularly weak in late medieval French manuscripts, which is a great time for France.

28:53.431 --> 29:03.705
And so we've bought, in fact, there's this great manuscript by Fouquet, which was unknown, which came up in California, both places in, what was it?

29:03.725 --> 29:05.087
Must have been about seven years ago.

29:05.848 --> 29:11.576
And so we bought that, and we bought actually a number of the major, Bordy Charon and a number of the major illuminators from the 15th century.

29:11.796 --> 29:18.785
And we have a nice, I think, small, but representative collection of what happened there, which is not part of, I mean, in a sense, that's all pretty much new.

29:18.805 --> 29:20.428
There are a couple of the big manuscripts.

29:20.448 --> 29:22.290
So there are areas that we've gone into and developed.

29:22.642 --> 29:27.869
On the other hand, I mean, in the end, when push comes to shove, we're going to buy the best things we can buy.

29:27.889 --> 29:35.358
And he had a terrific collection of Flemish manuscripts, but that's also an area where there's a lot of good stuff left, and some of the best things we've bought have also been Flemish.

29:35.979 --> 29:39.363
And I work in Flemish, and so I have a bias in favor of it.

29:39.383 --> 29:43.428
But I think, in fairness, even if I didn't work in Flemish, the stuff that remains is so terrific.

29:44.069 --> 29:45.450
You know, if you can get it, you buy it.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.353
So we want to buy beautiful objects.

29:47.373 --> 29:51.518
We want to buy the great object as far as we can.

29:51.734 --> 29:56.039
then as far as we can represent, we can represent the history of illumination where we will.

29:56.079 --> 30:01.564
Inevitably, every collection has different strengths, so, I mean, we'll never be great in Italian.

30:02.085 --> 30:04.788
It's hard to, Ludwig didn't do particularly well in Italian.

30:05.248 --> 30:07.230
It's very hard to buy great Italian manuscripts.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.133
They're simply not to be had, they're not to be found, or they can't be exported.

30:11.595 --> 30:17.421
We bought a number, we bought some beautiful Italian cuttings, so we're representing some of the artists, but frankly, in the end,

30:18.785 --> 30:22.429
There's some beautiful objects, but it'll be a worthwhile thing to do.

30:22.789 --> 30:24.370
It'll never be a great, great collection.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.151
It's just too late.

30:25.471 --> 30:28.675
Is there a great Italian collection in the United States?

30:28.975 --> 30:32.278
Yeah, the Morgan has great Italian things, fabulous Italian things.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.460
Because you've got that stuff where you can get it, too.

30:34.480 --> 30:34.761
Yeah, right.

30:34.781 --> 30:40.866
Well, see, if you look at what Morgan did, which is very interesting, is he bought, he started out by buying whole collections himself.

30:40.967 --> 30:42.608
He didn't buy just one Ludwig collection.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.029
He bought a whole series of them.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.632
They got all the William Morris material.

30:46.865 --> 30:48.187
and some of these other great collections.

30:48.227 --> 30:54.755
So he started out by picking up collections, and he was truly an amazing, absolutely amazing performance.

31:09.694 --> 31:10.735
Yeah, yeah.

31:10.916 --> 31:12.838
Which moral issues do you mean?

31:13.325 --> 31:26.657
Well, what I had said was that, you know, my impression was that Ludwig had promised the manuscripts to the Schnutkin Museum, and so on.

31:28.999 --> 31:33.764
And it was the city of Cologne that actually paid for the publication of his catalog, so he had some kind of an arrangement.

31:34.224 --> 31:37.987
I think it turned—I don't actually— Yeah, I don't know, in fact.

31:38.308 --> 31:41.931
I gather that nothing was ever on paper, although I honestly don't know that.

31:42.434 --> 31:48.743
But, as I said, so in a sense that one had to wonder exactly what Ludwig's motives were.

31:50.726 --> 31:57.537
But in the end, it was clear, as I said, it was clear to us that no matter what happened, Ludwig was going to sell these manuscripts because he needed money.

31:58.398 --> 32:02.524
And therefore, I mean, if we didn't buy them, someone else would buy them.

32:03.005 --> 32:10.416
And from my point of view, frankly, if they go to a public, I mean, we're a private institution technically, but because we make things available to the public,

32:10.598 --> 32:17.172
in a way that no private collector usually can or does, in a sense, it seems to me we're doing the moral and right thing in a certain way.

32:18.254 --> 32:21.661
These manuscripts are now available to the world in a way that they weren't before.

32:22.443 --> 32:28.135
And I actually think that museums perform, I mean, people always talk about the Getty devouring things.

32:28.385 --> 32:40.340
But the fact is that we have the potential to form a terrific public function, which is to make great objects that hardly anyone has ever seen available to the widest possible audience.

32:40.521 --> 32:42.563
And I think that is terrific.

32:43.785 --> 32:46.168
Do you really hear that, the Getty devouring things?

32:46.188 --> 32:50.173
Well, not so much anymore because the money doesn't go so far.

32:50.373 --> 32:59.503
I mean, one has to remember, I mean, I only buy a couple of objects a year, but most of the collections in the museum only buy a couple of objects a year anymore, because the money just doesn't go that far.

32:59.584 --> 33:01.285
I mean, that's one acquisition.

33:01.306 --> 33:01.726
Exactly.

33:01.826 --> 33:03.969
And our budget hasn't increased for years.

33:04.910 --> 33:08.153
And, I mean, we've sort of had a steady state budget because they're building this building project.

33:09.174 --> 33:18.906
So if we're going to buy quality, if we're going to buy the so-called great object, then you have to save your pennies and make sure you're ready for, you know, you've got the money there when the time comes.

33:19.146 --> 33:20.127
So it's not, we're not,

33:20.410 --> 33:27.217
I think when—I remember when I first started, people always said, well, we were so rich that we would wreck the art market.

33:27.618 --> 33:31.322
And there's no—you know, every time a very rich collector comes into the art market, prices go up.

33:31.562 --> 33:36.087
I mean, there's no question that we would affect the art market, and in some areas we've affected it more than others.

33:36.567 --> 33:46.418
I think probably psychologically the fact that a museum went in and bought the Ludwig Manuscripts had an effect on the art market, whether or not we would have continued to buy in the sense that

33:46.651 --> 33:53.819
The participation of a museum in any collecting area tends to validate that area and bring collectors in.

33:54.259 --> 34:03.389
And in fact, a number of the really big collectors in luminary manuscripts now weren't so active when we started.

34:04.230 --> 34:07.293
So, I mean, there may be a number of reasons for that.

34:07.594 --> 34:16.303
But one of the reasons may be that participation of a museum tends to sort of legitimize certain things, you know, sort of institutional approval.

34:17.633 --> 34:20.716
We'd love to see some of your things.

34:20.736 --> 34:21.077
Sure, sure.

34:21.377 --> 34:24.020
Would you like to see, actually, how should we do this?

34:24.040 --> 34:25.141
Do you want to see Ludwig things?

34:25.161 --> 34:26.263
Do you want to see Ethan things?

34:26.283 --> 34:27.624
Do you want to see our mystery of the Jews?

34:28.745 --> 34:35.893
Money, and so there are many, many things that we do, and it's not quite the bottomless, but the way I wish it was.

34:35.913 --> 34:41.059
One thing I didn't get is you said ideally you'd like to have a collection of 400 writers, but why don't you just say that again?

34:41.562 --> 34:44.951
I'd like to have a question for him.

34:45.032 --> 34:49.564
It's not likely realistic given the kind of money that's available.

34:49.584 --> 34:52.332
I think that would be...

34:52.632 --> 35:02.724
I can show you everything that I bought in the last three or four years in about 10 minutes.

35:02.744 --> 35:04.606
There's some great things.

35:04.646 --> 35:10.113
Hopefully you'll have a hard time looking at them.

35:10.253 --> 35:14.438
In seven years we've bought about 43 things.

35:15.143 --> 35:16.024
It's not wrong.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.385
Well, it could be lovely things.

35:17.585 --> 35:18.846
Yeah, no, they're still great things.

35:18.946 --> 35:19.707
They're still great things.

35:20.387 --> 35:21.969
I mean, you can actually do it.

35:23.250 --> 35:28.314
There are probably fewer important or good manuscripts left to find altogether, but they're still great objects.

35:28.354 --> 35:32.097
There's still a lot of medicine.

35:32.117 --> 35:35.780
There's a lot of good Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raffaello painting.

35:35.800 --> 35:42.006
You might get something close to it and it might just get any sense.

35:42.026 --> 35:44.948
Do you get a charger when you pick these up in the morning?

35:45.653 --> 35:49.019
Do they constantly give you a thrill?

35:51.903 --> 35:52.544
I love it.

35:52.625 --> 35:54.568
Creators are greedy people.

35:54.608 --> 35:56.130
They're collectors, really.

35:56.171 --> 35:57.873
They collect materials.

35:58.755 --> 36:00.718
There it is, huh?

36:00.738 --> 36:05.326
Come and have your picture taken by now.

36:05.346 --> 36:06.948
That's a nice thing.

36:11.095 --> 36:12.117
Oh, yeah.

36:13.008 --> 36:19.719
This is the Dyson Perons Apocalypse, which is probably one of the cornerstones of the Elizabeth collection.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.082
It's 13th century English.

36:22.563 --> 36:28.232
In fact, the 13th century in England, English Gothic was one of the great periods for manuscript illumination.

36:28.272 --> 36:32.198
Apocalypse was probably the most famous subject matter for

36:32.566 --> 36:35.371
for English Gothic, a number of great examples.

36:35.432 --> 36:38.958
This is not the greatest one, but it's a terrific example.

36:39.299 --> 36:42.846
And Dyson Perrins actually was the Ludwig at the first half of the 20th century.

36:42.906 --> 36:49.579
He was, actually his collection was already put together at the very beginning of the century, but was one of the great private collections of Luminaire manuscripts.

36:49.947 --> 36:52.770
He was, what are they called, the Ian Perrins Worcestershire sauce.

36:52.790 --> 36:54.572
That was Dyson Perrins.

36:54.893 --> 36:57.255
And he died in, I think it was January of 58.

36:57.475 --> 37:01.880
And by the end of the year, they had organized three major sales, 58, 59, and 60.

37:01.900 --> 37:10.911
And important for this story because that's when Krauss started buying really expensive manuscripts and when he found Ludwig as a client.

37:11.431 --> 37:14.915
And in fact, I think Ludwig bought his first book from Krauss in 58.

37:15.676 --> 37:19.380
That was actually the same year that Ludwig started collecting.

37:19.816 --> 37:21.918
And it was the same year they started selling Dyson Ferentz's.

37:21.938 --> 37:25.542
So some of the great things in Little Big Collection are Dyson Ferentz's manuscripts.

37:25.662 --> 37:27.764
700 years old.

37:28.965 --> 37:30.526
And this book has 82 miniatures.

37:30.566 --> 37:32.188
Every page has a miniature at the top.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.731
And the story of the book of Apocalypse is the book of Revelations.

37:35.751 --> 37:40.076
And so it gives the biblical text in black ink.

37:40.116 --> 37:43.879
And then there's a commentary about what it all means in red ink.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.341
And then the illustrations.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.284
It was English, and it escaped the dissolution.

37:48.324 --> 37:49.705
I wonder if it must have

37:50.292 --> 37:51.454
I wonder how it survived.

37:52.656 --> 37:54.981
Do you think this was ever in the British monastery?

37:56.403 --> 37:58.247
Oh yeah, probably at one point.

37:58.267 --> 37:59.990
Unless it was made for a private person.

38:00.451 --> 38:03.557
A book like this may have been made for a noblewoman.

38:04.358 --> 38:10.309
Of course, a noblewoman could have been an abbess or whatever, a monastery or whatever.

38:11.369 --> 38:14.292
but these probably were made for the great ladies.

38:15.153 --> 38:23.300
So what we did, what we always try to do is have something, a show that's coherent thematically.

38:23.781 --> 38:26.343
So this manuscript is the purpose of the show.

38:26.944 --> 38:38.575
If you want to treat the book as a work of art, you have a real problem because usually they tell stories and

38:38.960 --> 38:43.707
The work of art is, in a sense, functions through a sequence of images, but of course you can only open the book to one page.

38:44.368 --> 38:52.519
And at a place like us, where we're sort of an odd location, you don't exactly have off-the-street traffic where people walk in at lunchtime to see a show, so it doesn't make sense to turn the pages.

38:53.020 --> 39:01.772
So what we do is we put transparencies of other miniatures from the great books that are on view here, so people get some idea what the rest of the book looks like.

39:01.793 --> 39:05.718
It's an imperfect system, but it gives you some idea.

39:05.758 --> 39:07.060
And we also sort of put them

39:07.394 --> 39:14.461
against the walls and down in a way because, in a sense, we don't want people to get the ideas that these are the primary things.

39:14.601 --> 39:15.402
The art object comes first.

39:15.422 --> 39:19.005
The other one I've seen do this, though, to give us more than one page.

39:19.185 --> 39:21.908
The Morgan Library sometimes does it for special shows, but they don't.

39:22.048 --> 39:30.376
Actually, when I set up this, I know the people there, and I went and said, well, what have you guys done right, and what have you done wrong, and how can we improve?

39:30.776 --> 39:35.160
And they said, well, we always have our experiences up on the wall like this, and they always compete with the objects.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.182
So I said, fine, I'm not going to do that.

39:37.364 --> 39:39.467
I'll do it this way.

39:39.548 --> 39:50.866
In this particular show, all the things in the cases are from the main book, the Oppenheims, so if you really get into it, you can put that most of the book together.

39:50.886 --> 39:54.172
This is actually another one of the great writing manuscripts.

39:54.953 --> 39:59.721
He had three Ottonian manuscripts, which is 10th and 11th century.

39:59.821 --> 40:03.287
Actually, most of ours are 11th century, which were really terrific.

40:03.605 --> 40:04.931
and among the great things.

40:05.031 --> 40:13.125
And this house also has a beautiful treasury binding, which is a little hard to see.
