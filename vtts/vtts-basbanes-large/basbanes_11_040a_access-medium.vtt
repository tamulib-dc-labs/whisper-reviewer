00:02.275 --> 00:03.036
You can see the word.

00:03.096 --> 00:04.959
And if you want me to shut it up, tell me shut it up.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.964
No, the thing is what I would like, I would appreciate, though.

00:08.085 --> 00:12.852
I know this is very difficult to ask it when you've got so many people you're doing.

00:12.953 --> 00:15.397
I would like to see what you've heard of me before you do it.

00:15.517 --> 00:18.061
If you make me that deal, I'll talk to this man.

00:18.442 --> 00:26.134
I will show you any quote that I attribute to you that comes from you.

00:26.154 --> 00:28.418
I will go over and I will read to you on the phone.

00:29.140 --> 00:39.071
I won't give you a copy of the chapter or the book, but anything that you'd like.

00:39.091 --> 00:39.712
Okay, fine.

00:39.732 --> 00:46.460
Well, the simplest distinction, the sort of thing that you set out a copy of the book and somebody says, all right, you're dealing with rare books, what are they?

00:46.760 --> 00:49.323
You say, well, you could say.

00:49.343 --> 00:51.385
A rare book is a book that costs money.

00:51.486 --> 00:55.250
Now, it can cost money for several reasons.

00:55.270 --> 00:58.033
It can cost money because it's actually literally rare.

00:59.077 --> 01:02.541
There are very few copies of it now.

01:02.561 --> 01:04.943
It can cost money because it's beautiful.

01:04.963 --> 01:07.326
It can cost money because it's important.

01:08.087 --> 01:14.754
All of those are possible orders, but rarely is probably the least of the ordinary things.

01:14.914 --> 01:16.696
People have said this over and over again.

01:16.716 --> 01:24.645
The real value of books tends to be important as far as eating a piece that is in descending order.

01:24.963 --> 01:32.692
And rarity, perhaps, the least of them, because you can find books of which no other copy is known that you wouldn't give shelf space to.

01:33.873 --> 01:37.277
But what is the guiding principle to the bookseller?

01:37.317 --> 01:42.643
Well, we don't have books here that cost less than $50 or $100.

01:44.125 --> 01:47.269
So I suppose the criterion is price.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.814
I mean, that's from a rare bookseller's point.

01:52.503 --> 01:53.064
point of view.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.888
We're not snobs about age.

01:56.008 --> 02:01.015
If we get a book printed yesterday, it costs a great deal of money.

02:01.035 --> 02:05.602
We don't handle it if we like the book for other reasons.

02:06.603 --> 02:20.063
So really, what you are talking about in retail, and this is worldwide, is a system that you set up for, you know, some people are set up to sell objects for a buck of things.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.223
We're not set up for that.

02:22.243 --> 02:28.513
If we sell a book for a buck, we'd probably lose for $40 and then add more.

02:29.134 --> 02:33.941
Which books, it does seem to go beyond that book.

02:34.022 --> 02:35.584
It does seem to be something.

02:35.604 --> 02:36.485
Oh, sure.

02:36.505 --> 02:36.926
I mean, a spirit.

02:36.946 --> 02:40.191
When you reduce it to value, it's paper and boards.

02:40.852 --> 02:42.375
If you were to love this.

02:42.555 --> 02:42.996
Well, yes.

02:43.036 --> 02:44.498
That value is going to be negligible.

02:44.832 --> 02:50.117
Sure, but I'm answering your question, why do people speak of rare books?

02:50.217 --> 02:53.119
Well, really, most of them are talking about.

02:53.139 --> 02:56.262
How would you distinguish that from an antiquarian book?

02:56.863 --> 03:02.548
Well, many antiquarian books are inexpensive and rare book-sized.

03:03.529 --> 03:08.893
An antiquarian book is just a book that you can't buy at a new bookshop.

03:10.675 --> 03:13.978
An old book, I guess.

03:14.313 --> 03:22.040
We obviously have strong feelings about areas of stock and areas that we sell.

03:24.823 --> 03:30.068
For example, I'll give you a fairly good example.

03:30.829 --> 03:42.160
You can buy 18th century novels in 18th century editions fairly easily, and they are common enough.

03:43.692 --> 03:51.741
on the whole, even the first editions of the famous ones like Fielding's novels or Richardson's novels.

03:51.761 --> 03:57.328
They're common enough that you could probably, if you're a collector, pick and choose a non-profit.

03:58.429 --> 04:11.404
Now, we would, on the whole, not pursue copies of 18th-century novels in modern bundles because the best condition for it

04:11.890 --> 04:19.179
a book of this sort is felt, and we feel easily with it, to be contemporary.

04:19.199 --> 04:27.629
So, we are likely to form a kind of a stock around the best we can do with a book.

04:27.650 --> 04:40.986
Now, if we made the same condition for 17th century plays, or Shakespeare folios, we'd be, simply we wouldn't be operating in a modern market role.

04:41.573 --> 04:52.969
So our distinction, our conditions of the copies that we like to have, that we seek out, will tend to reflect availability.

04:53.069 --> 05:05.966
Now, I know this is not really answering the simple question of what a rare book is, but it rather depends on how rare the book is, what a rare book is.

05:06.046 --> 05:09.471
For example, Trilby, as an author,

05:10.953 --> 05:19.541
Trophy with Spendali, Gamori's Trophy is a novel that's pretty damn common and just in different conditions.

05:20.622 --> 05:24.685
And I would say, actually, if I saw an ordinary copy of it, I wouldn't even blink.

05:24.805 --> 05:29.330
I wouldn't say, let's have it, let's offer it, let's deal with it.

05:29.350 --> 05:32.072
But if I saw an absolutely beautiful copy, I would.

05:32.292 --> 05:37.357
I have one in Stockholm, but I wouldn't have one that was banged up.

05:38.278 --> 05:40.960
Whereas if I saw a banged up copy of

05:41.851 --> 05:46.116
second folio, and I'll probably take it seriously.

05:46.216 --> 05:49.840
You buy for quality, of course, and sell.

05:50.801 --> 05:59.992
You are among the very few booksellers, I would imagine, that continue to buy for stock, buy rarity for stock, general stock.

06:00.272 --> 06:04.797
There aren't many left to do that, I don't think.

06:05.318 --> 06:09.242
Well, I think most people, I mean, at your level?

06:09.593 --> 06:10.675
Well, no, no.

06:10.815 --> 06:12.076
We probably are.

06:12.177 --> 06:12.697
I don't know.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.742
You will know the world market better than me.

06:16.443 --> 06:25.115
But I would have thought we're probably just about the largest in terms of cash.

06:25.696 --> 06:30.642
So then, the question here develops from that.

06:31.283 --> 06:34.728
You basically determine rarity then, don't you?

06:34.808 --> 06:38.233
If you go to an auction, you go for sale.

06:39.277 --> 06:40.739
willing to send for an item.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.482
I don't know what you think it's worth.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.006
Well, when you say determine, I would say decide upon.

06:45.807 --> 06:47.630
Yeah, okay.

06:47.851 --> 06:49.974
We don't define it.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.797
How would you distinguish between the two, then?

06:52.057 --> 06:52.798
Very simply.

06:52.818 --> 06:54.501
I mean, we make our own decisions.

06:54.601 --> 06:56.324
That doesn't actually determine the case.

06:56.404 --> 07:00.631
We could, for example, decide if it was worth X and it could go for 3X.

07:01.893 --> 07:02.474
What's true?

07:02.794 --> 07:05.618
Our appraisal are the market prices.

07:05.639 --> 07:06.600
Yeah, but I mean,

07:07.087 --> 07:16.239
When you're in the heat of battle, so to speak, and you've decided on X, is that as far as you go, or are you willing to go to 3X on it?

07:16.259 --> 07:16.620
A 2.5.

07:16.660 --> 07:18.462
You can have a bit of a 2.5.

07:18.542 --> 07:22.888
If I said we decided on X, then I would go to 3X on it.

07:22.908 --> 07:26.793
In the heat of battle, I wouldn't sound too good with that.

07:26.973 --> 07:28.756
Interesting.

07:29.256 --> 07:31.299
Auctions are, as you know.

07:31.319 --> 07:33.702
Well, I've quoted you in my situation.

07:34.627 --> 07:43.200
I asked you, how is it that Cervantes went for $1.65 million when everybody said it was going to go for $250,000?

07:43.220 --> 07:46.646
You said two people wanted it very badly, and only one of them could get it.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.607
That's true.

07:47.627 --> 07:49.029
That's what makes it.

07:49.089 --> 07:52.915
That's the other bit of principle, I guess.

07:53.897 --> 07:59.345
But then again, if that same book were to go on three or four months later, who knows?

07:59.365 --> 08:00.707
That's right.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.490
We'll look up the Shakespeare full wheel.

08:03.365 --> 08:04.326
and the guidance.

08:04.466 --> 08:07.030
Yes, they lingered.

08:07.490 --> 08:09.593
They've wandered, too, since then.

08:09.773 --> 08:11.295
Yeah.

08:11.836 --> 08:16.421
Well, they're in one hand now, but at least the first.

08:16.441 --> 08:17.142
Well, I guess all.

08:18.984 --> 08:21.568
But they were purchased for measurably less than they went for.

08:21.608 --> 08:24.631
Yes, that's true.

08:24.652 --> 08:29.117
In fact, I think they changed hands for less than I even did.

08:29.918 --> 08:33.102
But then again, what did people bid when they went up again at the many sales?

08:33.385 --> 08:44.238
I think David bought the men at 1.5, but nobody could see anybody doing it after $600,000 or $700,000.

08:44.659 --> 08:46.141
That's not quite true.

08:46.161 --> 08:48.463
I think I don't remember.

08:49.885 --> 08:50.406
Did you remember?

08:50.486 --> 08:51.407
No, I think that's all.

08:52.628 --> 08:59.877
I'm not sure it would have been the smartest purchase.

08:59.897 --> 09:03.021
With things which are extremely visible in the auction market,

09:03.743 --> 09:19.639
The dealer's dilemma is that he has to be willing to buy something for a lot of money if it costs that, and to hold it until someone wishes to buy it.

09:19.659 --> 09:33.193
And since the cost is a matter of extremely open record, and in some cases another copy or something similar could come along,

09:34.000 --> 09:44.474
almost at once, this can be a serious gap, especially for people without a lot of sort of un-encompassing capital to play with.

09:44.494 --> 09:47.438
Now, I'm not asking you about any particular sale.

09:47.458 --> 09:51.083
I mean, you mentioned Shakespeare, you mentioned that he'd been a millionaire.

09:51.103 --> 09:52.104
I don't think so, I can't.

09:52.184 --> 09:56.991
I believe, I'm not... Either in the garden or... Yeah, whatever.

09:57.932 --> 10:02.438
But were you doing that with a specific client in mind, or were you doing that with...

10:03.127 --> 10:14.622
You have the authorization of the firm that's a million dollars without knowingly having a particular... I think in one of those two sales, that's true.

10:14.642 --> 10:20.229
So there's a meeting and they say, fine, if we can get it for a million, we'll go a million.

10:20.249 --> 10:22.712
And does that generally happen when you go to these sales?

10:22.732 --> 10:30.282
You kind of have a mandate of... Well, I don't think I want to talk about the internal decision-making here, but

10:30.920 --> 10:34.545
Yes, in general, we're not a bunch of loose counts.

10:34.565 --> 10:41.815
We don't go off and have bills that could bankrupt.

10:41.835 --> 10:47.222
But we do consult and discuss everything.

10:47.242 --> 10:59.138
It is a matter of just deciding whether you're willing to, whether you think it's wise, to hold stock of a certain period of time.

10:59.506 --> 11:05.896
as time goes, but it can be very possible.

11:06.056 --> 11:22.743
As a major figure here, Clark, arguably the most prestigious bookseller in the world, I mean, it was a good general softball, not a hardball.

11:23.324 --> 11:24.265
Signed by the Splinter.

11:24.566 --> 11:25.427
Is that right?

11:25.628 --> 11:26.509
I envy you.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.177
Present from Maureen Island.

11:32.879 --> 11:43.629
Anyway, how would you judge the state of the real book world as we approach the year 2000?

11:44.129 --> 11:46.632
Is the interest still as strong in books?

11:47.873 --> 11:48.934
Are the collectors there?

11:48.954 --> 11:56.260
Do you find that you're dealing with an older, like the owners of Cadillacs now have it.

11:56.864 --> 12:00.029
No, actually, the curious thing is I don't think that's so.

12:00.990 --> 12:12.808
I think the world isn't quite as... the world of collectors isn't quite, perhaps, as guild-edged as it once was.

12:12.828 --> 12:24.846
I mean, there are lots of collectors, but many of the most powerful ones these days are not old-timers at all, but the only one they have yet to make there.

12:25.535 --> 12:30.041
You have to make their mark, and whether they will stay in it a long time, one doesn't know.

12:30.061 --> 12:51.612
That's one of the great problems of collecting in general, is that if you're really committed to this field at a fairly high level, you've got to collect for a long time before you make the kind of dent in the history of book collecting that your predecessors did.

12:51.632 --> 12:54.816
But don't forget that famous collectors like Claussen,

12:55.184 --> 12:56.445
a Buffalo collector.

12:56.746 --> 12:58.568
Have you written a lot of him?

12:58.688 --> 13:00.430
I haven't written a lot of him.

13:00.570 --> 13:01.911
Well, you don't lie to me.

13:01.931 --> 13:08.338
Closon was only in business, I'm not sure of this, but only about 10 years.

13:08.358 --> 13:12.843
That whole thing, he was a Rosenbach customer who was for a while a favorite song.

13:12.863 --> 13:15.445
He built and built and built great stuff.

13:15.726 --> 13:18.368
An enormous catalog, great sale.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.092
And you think, you know, how long could my guy have been doing it?

13:22.112 --> 13:22.693
A very short time.

13:24.698 --> 13:26.500
And we have these comers and goers.

13:27.081 --> 13:36.731
We'll talk of, even though Moore was not a long-term collector.

13:37.312 --> 13:45.040
Well, Dick Matty's a different story, because he's really still a collector, and we wouldn't want him to find anything.

13:45.060 --> 13:49.245
He's trying to get the same collection back.

13:49.265 --> 13:49.525
That's right.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.532
He said, this time I'm going to be much more focused.

13:52.552 --> 13:58.638
And I said, what are you going to be focused on, Dick?

13:58.658 --> 14:05.085
And he said, well, no, I'm trying to buy back the books I have.

14:05.105 --> 14:18.718
But, for example, Bradley Martin, who was a lifetime collector, and while he had enthusiasms in various directions, like French books, bird books, English letters, I mean, these all reflect

14:19.323 --> 14:23.147
Almost all, some of them were relatively new fields.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.549
They almost always reflect a very long time going.

14:26.990 --> 14:48.250
Now, a specialist collector, if he gets lucky or something, he comes along at the right moment that you wanted to collect trolley, and you came along at the time of the Yardley sales, and you could have, for a certain amount of money, painful as it might have seemed, you could have had the greatest trolley collection in the world, and kept at him.

14:48.533 --> 14:53.018
and had it in one or two days, he couldn't.

14:53.799 --> 14:56.702
But on the whole, that isn't the way things work.

14:56.722 --> 15:01.267
I mean, a young person starts out and thinks, I want to collect Dickens.

15:01.287 --> 15:15.102
Well, he's looking over his shoulder at guys who have huge or impressive collections, everything in presentation form, they have letters, they have this, they have that.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.684
All he can do is

15:17.018 --> 15:19.422
fight for what comes up now.

15:19.442 --> 15:22.687
And maybe he will take something away.

15:22.707 --> 15:28.036
It may be very costly, and the nice new book is offered for the first time.

15:28.056 --> 15:29.418
The collection breaks up.

15:29.438 --> 15:32.083
If he's young, he has hopes.

15:32.283 --> 15:42.199
There are many fields which have been so dominated by collectors in the past that it's amazing to me that people get into them, and yet they do, like Samuel Johnson.

15:42.787 --> 15:46.171
You said that there are collectors who want local records, so to speak.

15:46.191 --> 15:52.318
Do you actually find people who want to be regarded or make a dent in the history books?

15:52.338 --> 15:55.061
Oh, I don't know.

15:55.081 --> 15:55.341
Wouldn't you?

15:55.361 --> 16:02.149
You'd sort of feel, you know, I'd like to be... I mean, it's not that I just want a handful of things on the shelves.

16:02.509 --> 16:05.973
I'd like my collection to be somehow different from anyone else's.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.457
You said, so therefore, that it's not a gilded group.

16:10.218 --> 16:11.359
You do see some younger...

16:12.115 --> 16:17.803
younger people like, you know, my age, younger than that.

16:17.863 --> 16:18.724
Yeah, yeah.

16:18.804 --> 16:21.227
I mean, there are people coming along all the time.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.712
And we learn about them.

16:24.732 --> 16:25.914
They sometimes come to us.

16:26.054 --> 16:30.680
Many times they collect for a bit before they come to us.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.765
But, yeah, in all countries, Europe especially.

16:34.785 --> 16:39.692
Do you find that they're collecting for pleasure or investment?

16:40.837 --> 16:46.865
That's always been an extremely difficult line to discuss.

16:46.885 --> 17:06.571
I mean, the problem is that almost anyone collecting with a substantial part of his own income is looking at his collection in terms of its ultimate value, its resale.

17:06.591 --> 17:08.413
Even if you never intend to sell a book,

17:09.473 --> 17:20.262
It's hard not to look at the assets as they pile up on the shelf and think, what's smart to buy?

17:21.363 --> 17:31.492
On the whole, people who stress investment over individual preference, I think, do worse.

17:31.512 --> 17:38.518
They don't get the votes that they really ought to have because they think, is that really worth it?

17:39.258 --> 17:53.693
They make their decision with their pocketbook rather than their heart, and it can lead to a collection which has all about the things that you really think the guy should have.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.796
But that's an easy thing to say.

17:58.338 --> 18:07.307
Remember also, if you set yourself a program, you say, I want to collect Victorian fiction, like Robert Lee Wolf did, with a

18:07.878 --> 18:12.884
a good income, but not, he wasn't a really wealthy man.

18:12.904 --> 18:21.455
I mean, Robert Lee Wolf built up this enormous collection of Victorian novels that's now at Texas after his death.

18:22.256 --> 18:29.285
All his youth, he deliberately avoided Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, Thomas Hardy.

18:29.305 --> 18:31.828
He just said, you know, these are too expensive.

18:31.908 --> 18:37.075
I could spend all the money I have buying these, so let me buy the ones that I won't see again.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.713
Let me buy the minor stuff.

18:39.733 --> 18:49.589
And by the end of his life, he actually had enough extra, and he had all this huge quantity of stuff, that he was able then to turn to the high spots.

18:49.669 --> 18:56.621
And you could argue that he never got the kind of high spotty books that he would have if he'd been looking for them all along.

18:57.502 --> 19:03.552
But that was his way of making, of taking an amount of money he had to spend.

19:03.734 --> 19:07.398
But he did collect the minor writers, which is interesting in its own way, isn't it?

19:07.518 --> 19:07.938
Oh, yes.

19:07.998 --> 19:11.361
Well, I mean, he built a stunning collection, I agree.

19:11.562 --> 19:15.906
More minor than Sally would have touched.

19:15.926 --> 19:21.031
And as a result, he gave himself a terrific perspective on what was out there.

19:21.051 --> 19:29.159
Because he knew so much more about people that we all thought were just a mother-in-law.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.442
We used to go back to a crazy distance

19:32.708 --> 19:47.564
You mean by that the collection almost cries out to have certain books that they... Well, suppose again, I'll tell you a personal attitude.

19:47.584 --> 19:52.869
I started out in life wanting to collect books about Tahiti.

19:52.889 --> 20:01.298
I have roughly, I don't know, I suppose at the outset, outside I have maybe $500 a year

20:02.290 --> 20:04.593
That wouldn't get you very far.

20:04.613 --> 20:07.275
But I was very assiduous.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.598
I really did want the stuff about Tahiti.

20:09.618 --> 20:27.878
And somewhere about the second year I was doing this, I think 1961, the original journals of Captain Wallace's voyage to Tahiti, the English discovery, along with lots of washed drawings of Tahiti, came up at auction.

20:27.898 --> 20:30.441
They didn't fetch that much.

20:30.893 --> 20:32.635
taking a deep breath.

20:32.735 --> 20:33.496
I could have bought one.

20:34.418 --> 20:34.978
But I couldn't.

20:35.179 --> 20:35.859
I couldn't possibly.

20:36.961 --> 20:45.212
And I knew that from then on that I would always have lived through the sale of the absolute cornerstone of what I wanted to be, my collection.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.314
And I couldn't even compete for it.

20:48.436 --> 20:51.240
So I gave up collecting to E.D.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.262
And I think that's the problem.

20:53.402 --> 20:54.043
You couldn't get that.

20:54.063 --> 20:56.186
Well, I mean, I just thought, how silly.

20:57.868 --> 20:59.230
I mean, I could follow

20:59.665 --> 21:01.167
Do you collect that?

21:02.209 --> 21:02.870
Oh, I do.

21:04.292 --> 21:04.773
What do you collect?

21:04.793 --> 21:06.816
Well, I collect in many directions.

21:06.836 --> 21:21.417
My wife and I are very serious about scholars of the 19th century and the 18th century, literary scholars and also book collectors and bibliographers.

21:21.437 --> 21:27.867
We have a lot of association material, this sort of thing, and we also collect a lot of curious

21:28.572 --> 21:33.019
of separate directions along, trying to stay on a direct competition.

21:33.119 --> 21:37.526
Do you collect synergistically, so to speak, or do you collect independently?

21:37.606 --> 21:38.828
No, together.

21:40.751 --> 21:45.098
I don't take up too much of your family.

21:45.198 --> 21:50.967
Do you advise people?

21:51.047 --> 21:54.713
Do you act like a financial advisor?

21:54.773 --> 21:56.335
I mean, do you act like an investment?

21:56.804 --> 22:01.229
but we had a lot of collectibles and then looking for guidance.

22:01.929 --> 22:06.074
Do you work at it and say... Sure.

22:06.314 --> 22:07.195
I mean, when asked.

22:07.515 --> 22:13.622
I mean, some people really resent this and some people really want it.

22:13.642 --> 22:18.127
I mean, you know, we do.

22:18.147 --> 22:20.469
A straight question will get a straight answer.

22:20.549 --> 22:25.815
Of course, we, like any sane

22:26.572 --> 22:42.413
member of a Beeland community, we wouldn't, if all you want to ask is whether you should buy this book for that much from somebody else, we're not going to trash it or endorse it, although we probably will answer.

22:43.434 --> 22:52.005
But yes, many people do come to us asking for general advice.

22:53.048 --> 23:02.780
It's surprising, even if you're a real expert, it's surprising how much a bookseller might actually know that you can't believe you didn't know.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.064
That is an aspect that I'm trying to explore.

23:06.084 --> 23:10.409
Do you find that booksellers today are scholars about it?

23:10.429 --> 23:14.394
Well, scholars in the formal sense, and some are, some write.

23:14.634 --> 23:17.217
I mean, and yourself, we should point out, you have a number of

23:18.040 --> 23:21.865
advanced degrees that you taught, as a matter of fact, didn't you?

23:21.885 --> 23:23.207
Did you teach at Harvard?

23:23.447 --> 23:26.110
No, I was a professor.

23:26.130 --> 23:32.699
Yes, I've written ten books.

23:32.739 --> 23:34.461
Fifty or sixty articles.

23:34.481 --> 23:45.415
That's right, so you have a scholarly... Yeah, but on the whole, the scholarship of a bookseller is in his simple knowledge of stuff.

23:46.137 --> 24:05.897
If I want to know something obscure about a certain author or book, I can often call somebody who never made it out of high school and who will be able to read me lessons in that.

24:05.917 --> 24:09.320
It is astonishing where you find information.

24:09.340 --> 24:14.265
It's a small world, but it's very, very tightly connected.

24:14.285 --> 24:15.486
The lines are very clear.

24:16.563 --> 24:26.234
I mean, I have a letter on my desk from somebody who's finished up a bibliography of Thomas Froden of Dupin.

24:26.575 --> 24:30.680
And I guess it's she, I don't know, Karma Pippen.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.603
Isn't that a California name beyond description?

24:33.623 --> 24:34.804
It just arrived yesterday.

24:34.905 --> 24:40.031
And she's writing, asking for help getting into the Rylands Library, which I can't give her.

24:40.051 --> 24:45.557
But on the other hand, what she's going to get when I do write back is...

24:45.858 --> 24:56.312
the location of half a dozen dedication copies of Dildon's books, and some extremely important bibliographical correspondence, which I've got.

24:56.813 --> 24:58.555
But, you know, she won't know that.

24:58.616 --> 25:00.558
That's not what she's asking.

25:00.578 --> 25:03.082
We're assuming that she's a she.

25:03.242 --> 25:03.823
I guess I am.

25:03.843 --> 25:04.744
That's one of the problems.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.246
I'm not recommending her to Ronald.

25:06.326 --> 25:10.532
I can't say it's the... I thought you said Jackson did a pretty good Dildon's book.

25:10.752 --> 25:12.475
Well, it was something.

25:12.615 --> 25:15.278
It was published posthumously.

25:15.299 --> 25:15.679
It was my guru.

25:16.722 --> 25:18.084
Oh, very.

25:18.905 --> 25:27.497
And it was published from his notes by Bill Bond, actually, after his death.

25:27.517 --> 25:29.460
And it's perfectly good.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.042
It's not.

25:32.604 --> 25:38.392
He did not want to treat business with a high seriousness.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.313
He liked him.

25:39.333 --> 25:39.694
He liked him.

25:39.834 --> 25:40.415
He liked him.

25:40.475 --> 25:42.437
He had affection for him.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.198
Oh, I know.

25:43.218 --> 25:44.400
And you can't help him.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.654
I can't help that myself.

25:47.674 --> 25:57.588
You see, I live in Bryanson Square, and Bittman was the rector, the first rector of the church at the head of the St.

25:57.608 --> 26:00.312
Mary's, and the gift of Lord Spencer.

26:00.692 --> 26:05.940
And so he lent lectures from Bryanson Square.

26:06.861 --> 26:11.508
He had the dedication to that, and several others.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.252
Christopher Spencer's library is at the

26:15.346 --> 26:17.748
Well, lots of it is, yeah.

26:18.109 --> 26:27.617
The principal thing, for example, I have the dispenser catalog for the large paper.

26:27.737 --> 26:28.298
That's yours?

26:28.999 --> 26:31.261
Good for you.

26:31.281 --> 26:34.304
That was kept about five months old.

26:34.444 --> 26:35.945
The family is still in health.

26:36.546 --> 26:43.412
And they have still some very important material there that dip into something.

26:44.506 --> 26:48.090
Anyway, this bibliography does appear to be going through.

26:48.791 --> 26:51.234
It's what John Wendell started.

26:51.294 --> 26:58.281
Can you think of anything?

26:59.803 --> 27:00.063
Sure.

27:00.104 --> 27:08.573
I'm sorry about the sort of hard ride at the beginning of it, but I felt a little bitter about Haven because I've been always very fond of him.
