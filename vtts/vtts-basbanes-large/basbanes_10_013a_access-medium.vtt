WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:04.636
This is good stuff, sir.

00:05.157 --> 00:08.883
You're just talking now in general, right, about... Well, no.

00:08.903 --> 00:13.070
One book you're going to film and discard.

00:13.311 --> 00:20.123
Another book you're going to preserve everything you can of and keep it forever.

00:20.864 --> 00:26.173
Another you're going to film and you're going to put in HD and just let it alone, as you said.

00:26.440 --> 00:54.861
phased deterioration somebody's got to tell you what to do somebody has got to tell you what to do with each individual case gene ashton out of columbia said they have a new category of book down there called medium rare interesting he's been talking to charles tannenbaum is that right you know him guy who's rolling his love old pal

00:55.128 --> 00:58.615
Have you heard of that before, the medium rare?

00:58.695 --> 00:59.797
Oh, yes.

01:00.579 --> 01:11.179
He was proposing that a chamber in Le Mans be devoted to medium rare books so that students could browse them.

01:12.053 --> 01:36.728
use them but they're not for circulation you can look at them there you can't I guess so and I guess decisions are made in an individual basis whether or not we will allow photocopies you might want to talk with him he's in the Grolier Club book there's only two N's in his tannin bound it's not the usual 3N tannin bound he's a 2N tannin bound you might want to talk to him about that he's got a nifty idea and

01:37.265 --> 01:45.976
I told him that this would probably only work if someone like me were the librarian of a college.

01:48.259 --> 02:04.420
I would give him space and staff and expose students in my college to the whole range of rare books, maps, broadsides, manuscripts, letters, you know, the way he does it.

02:04.703 --> 02:10.791
But it's highly unlikely that someone like me will ever become a college librarian.

02:10.831 --> 02:19.864
And it's highly unlikely that any college librarian would give him the space for effort, you know, energy for this.

02:19.884 --> 02:20.845
What does Tenenbaum do?

02:21.486 --> 02:22.147
He's retired.

02:22.828 --> 02:24.250
What did he do?

02:24.290 --> 02:25.211
Retire from what?

02:25.952 --> 02:28.095
He's a law graduate.

02:28.784 --> 02:31.548
His family had real estate in New York, and he managed.

02:31.608 --> 02:32.269
I don't know what else.

02:32.469 --> 02:35.534
But I mean, so he's basically an amateur in the field then?

02:35.594 --> 02:35.814
Yes.

02:36.475 --> 02:37.577
But he's made exhibitions.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.740
Watch the next exhibition catalog in Widener.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.284
It's his 21st exhibition.

02:42.324 --> 02:44.808
He's been making exhibitions all around the country in libraries.

02:45.969 --> 02:47.852
He's an amusing man.

02:48.854 --> 02:49.795
Tenant bomb.

02:51.357 --> 02:53.320
Good.

02:53.340 --> 02:53.881
An amusing man.

02:54.101 --> 02:55.203
We were talking on the way over.

02:55.423 --> 02:57.306
If I were to...

02:57.421 --> 03:00.585
to be thinking about this general concept of bibliography.

03:00.605 --> 03:04.329
For instance, I want to talk to Father Boyle at the Vatican Library about the St.

03:04.369 --> 03:08.374
Augustine project, which is supposed to take 400 years or 200 years.

03:10.676 --> 03:13.440
Are you familiar with that project?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.182
I learned about this at the University of Toronto.

03:15.222 --> 03:21.589
I was up at the Fisher Rare Books Library with Richard Landon, and they gave a talk there, and spent three days doing interviews

03:22.058 --> 03:25.262
I'm really excited about that.

03:25.382 --> 03:27.224
It's really going to be very comprehensive.

03:27.905 --> 03:29.587
And they are committed to books.

03:29.627 --> 03:32.470
The British Library is committed to books.

03:33.431 --> 03:39.578
Why is it that we're in such a rush in this country now to slide books out the back door?

03:39.658 --> 03:43.302
I mean, do you see this happening?

03:43.342 --> 03:44.083
Who says that we are?

03:44.671 --> 03:45.192
I'm sorry?

03:45.734 --> 03:46.435
Who says that we are?

03:46.475 --> 03:49.322
Not Harvard, but... In this country.

03:49.924 --> 03:52.670
Well, University of Michigan, for instance.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.299
There's a scandal of the San Francisco Public Library, right?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.023
It's not unique, though.

03:58.043 --> 04:00.148
It's a scandal of the San Francisco Public Library.

04:00.500 --> 04:05.946
Did the library director there win his job at the, what was he up for ALA office?

04:05.986 --> 04:07.367
I don't know, it's July.

04:07.608 --> 04:08.148
Remember that?

04:08.309 --> 04:10.231
Yeah, well, Kenneth Dowland.

04:10.311 --> 04:12.473
In the New York expose?

04:12.613 --> 04:13.714
That's right.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.799
The guy who engineered that was up for a national office.

04:18.159 --> 04:19.260
Ken Dowland is his name.

04:19.280 --> 04:19.441
Really?

04:19.761 --> 04:20.021
Yeah.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.002
I don't know those people.

04:21.363 --> 04:28.971
I don't know who they are and what they do, but that was truly scandalous.

04:28.951 --> 04:33.195
But that's not why he lost his job.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.560
He lost his job because he was spending too much money.

04:37.580 --> 04:38.801
What did he lose his job?

04:38.821 --> 04:39.382
Well, he's out.

04:39.802 --> 04:40.823
Oh, I didn't know that.

04:40.923 --> 04:41.944
He got fired in San Francisco.

04:42.064 --> 04:42.605
Oh, really?

04:42.645 --> 04:45.087
The irony is he's still running for the ALA.

04:45.448 --> 04:47.190
I thought he was going from strength to strength.

04:48.171 --> 04:49.532
No, he's got plastic to fire.

04:49.812 --> 04:52.275
Was there a follow-up to the New Yorker about that?

04:52.715 --> 04:54.557
No, but it was in the San Francisco papers.

04:54.637 --> 04:55.858
I'll happily send you copies.

04:55.878 --> 04:56.379
Oh, no, no, no.

04:56.439 --> 04:57.540
I believe you.

04:57.925 --> 05:01.689
It's just extraordinary because things like that don't happen.

05:01.729 --> 05:11.900
People who do that usually just go on, you know, they're then recruited for the Chicago Public Library, and they become president of IFLA.

05:12.080 --> 05:19.268
Except that the budget was for X millions of dollars, and they're like $130 million in the red.

05:19.468 --> 05:22.031
So it wasn't about what he did.

05:22.091 --> 05:25.314
It had nothing to do with the books.

05:25.715 --> 05:27.797
It had everything to do with the budget.

05:28.199 --> 05:33.604
It's like putting a mafioso in jail for income tax.

05:33.624 --> 05:33.945
Basically, yeah.

05:33.965 --> 05:35.546
Yeah, that's not why he got fired.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.309
He got fired for... Can you bring us two more of these, please?

05:38.329 --> 05:38.629
Sure.

05:40.451 --> 05:41.912
So he got fired for the wrong thing.

05:42.153 --> 05:42.473
Yeah.

05:43.754 --> 05:45.776
I want to send you a... I'm sorry.

05:45.976 --> 05:47.638
I'll mail it out this afternoon.

05:47.658 --> 05:53.264
There's a Pierre Beres piece that was in Le Monde that... Oh, yes, you promised to send me that.

05:53.324 --> 05:53.944
I did, and I'm sorry.

05:53.964 --> 05:54.865
I was going to bring it.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.367
I have just sent him.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.267
Do you read The New Yorker?

05:57.488 --> 05:57.868
I do.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.703
Did you read the issue this week?

06:01.064 --> 06:02.005
My wife has it.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.267
I have it this week.

06:03.287 --> 06:04.189
Look at the cartoons.

06:05.971 --> 06:14.644
You'll find a cartoon done by the guy, I don't know his name, the guy who has kind of shaggy dog people in his cartoons.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.389
Yeah, I know.

06:17.429 --> 06:22.336
And there's this guy standing there wrapped up in a shawl.

06:22.797 --> 06:24.820
Or a, what do you call it?

06:26.683 --> 06:26.843
A shawl.

06:27.110 --> 06:28.011
A cape?

06:28.031 --> 06:28.472
A cape?

06:28.492 --> 06:33.840
No, it's a, I don't know, what do you call it?

06:33.860 --> 06:34.621
Pundled up in the winter.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.423
But a scarf.

06:36.444 --> 06:37.385
A fancy scarf.

06:37.906 --> 06:41.130
Wrapped all around it in several ways, and it's down on the floor.

06:41.531 --> 06:54.670
And the woman who is talking to Samoa, I can mention to the waitress that we want to wear glasses of wine, too.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.813
Is saying,

06:57.316 --> 06:59.802
Oh, I can tell you're a Frenchman from your scarf.

07:02.168 --> 07:13.755
And if you've met Beretz, you know that he has this scarf on always, winter and summer, which he takes from Mallarmé, who had a scarf too.

07:14.528 --> 07:17.192
I saw him at a sale in New York at Sotheby's.

07:17.212 --> 07:18.554
Did he have a scarf?

07:18.574 --> 07:19.756
Yeah, he had a scarf on.

07:20.337 --> 07:21.058
Quite dramatic.

07:21.999 --> 07:26.326
Yes.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.670
Well, who would you recommend?

07:28.690 --> 07:31.774
Now, you say that there are people dying off in Europe.

07:32.175 --> 07:35.320
Who specifically is at the top of your list today?

07:35.340 --> 07:36.582
Who would you urge me to see?

07:36.622 --> 07:40.047
Beres and Lucien Scheler.

07:41.039 --> 07:44.845
Lucien is in Paris, and how do I contact Lucien?

07:45.847 --> 07:49.413
Directly.

07:49.433 --> 07:56.244
He's in the rue de Grinnell, and through Bernard Claveroy, who runs his, who bought his shop.

07:56.264 --> 08:01.292
You remember that Elburn thing?

08:01.525 --> 08:08.293
And I talked about Dilburn going to, went to school with Lucien Shailer, and Shailer made a lot of the quotes about him.

08:13.019 --> 08:16.663
Who is, who brought, who took his shop, who brought his shop again?

08:17.384 --> 08:24.473
Bernard Clavroy, C-L-A-V-R-E-U-I-L.

08:24.593 --> 08:29.139
So what I should do is contact Bernard and ask him if he can put me in touch with Lucien.

08:29.659 --> 08:31.161
Do you have the IFLA directory?

08:31.310 --> 08:32.893
I-F-L-A.

08:33.073 --> 08:33.874
No.

08:34.215 --> 08:36.198
You know what it is?

08:36.238 --> 08:36.479
No.

08:36.859 --> 08:38.462
The International Antiquariat.

08:39.163 --> 08:41.487
No, I don't have that yet.

08:41.507 --> 08:43.751
That's something I should have.

08:43.771 --> 08:46.876
It's full of names and places when you go abroad.

08:47.477 --> 08:50.702
And you can buy it from that...

08:51.340 --> 08:54.708
ABAA Center in Rockefeller?

08:55.048 --> 08:55.369
Really?

08:55.690 --> 08:56.472
Where is it?

08:57.093 --> 08:58.115
I know Leanne.

08:58.135 --> 08:59.819
I'll call Leanne Thomas.

09:00.180 --> 09:10.463
It's very useful and it's got the names of all the dealers so that you would find

09:11.557 --> 09:18.505
an entry for the Lucienne Shaler shop, and you'd find the proprietor as Bernard Cloroyan, I think.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.628
That'd be very useful to you.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.532
They're all worth 25 or 30 bucks, whatever it is.

09:25.572 --> 09:27.554
Do both of these gentlemen speak English, I hope?

09:28.395 --> 09:30.458
Yes, everybody speaks English.

09:30.478 --> 09:37.125
And you and I are the ones that have trouble with it.

09:37.145 --> 09:40.028
Shaler is a, he's an immigrant.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.729
He escaped.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.032
He's a Belgian.

09:46.834 --> 09:50.979
He's very handsome.

09:52.902 --> 09:58.389
I've seen him in the last few years.

09:58.409 --> 10:00.612
He's still very handsome.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.497
And Elbrun

10:04.612 --> 10:06.515
was with Madame Thomas.

10:06.595 --> 10:23.580
He started his own shop.

10:23.700 --> 10:31.211
Manusia came with Madame Thomas.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.433
I think he married her.

10:32.573 --> 10:34.095
He had a child.

10:34.379 --> 10:38.065
He was a bookseller.

10:38.565 --> 10:46.698
And then he had, for the mistress, the child was a bookseller, you said?

10:46.718 --> 10:46.798
Huh?

10:46.818 --> 10:48.681
The child was a bookseller?

10:48.801 --> 10:48.901
Yeah.

10:48.921 --> 10:51.405
He is, I think.

10:52.527 --> 11:00.960
He had as a mistress, um, vial.

11:01.092 --> 11:03.975
I can't do her first name.

11:05.877 --> 11:09.120
Madame Vile, who did the periodical business, is still going in Paris.

11:09.541 --> 11:15.047
So we had these two brilliant booksellers, one for a wife, one for a mistress.

11:16.248 --> 11:17.890
He wrote poetry, published poetry.

11:17.910 --> 11:18.951
Look him up in any catalog.

11:19.131 --> 11:24.957
You find a bunch of poems, and he spells his name S-C-H-E-L-E-R, S-C-H.

11:26.168 --> 11:28.831
And that's how you get Libri Tomas-Shaler.

11:28.851 --> 11:37.642
It'd be wonderful.

11:38.343 --> 11:46.253
What would you love to hear him if you were conducting, if you were me conducting the interview with him, what would you like to hear him talk about?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.339
What would you like to hear him?

11:48.359 --> 11:53.093
I'd like to hear him talk about the occupation.

11:53.214 --> 11:55.520
How'd he get out?

11:55.541 --> 12:00.455
No, he was there the whole time.

12:00.475 --> 12:01.137
He's not Jewish.

12:01.370 --> 12:05.956
He's not Jewish.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.978
No, too bad.

12:08.739 --> 12:10.241
They're not all Jewish, I don't know.

12:10.582 --> 12:12.364
Get me wrong.

12:12.384 --> 12:14.767
They're not Jewish.

12:14.987 --> 12:21.356
But he'd probably tell you about Michel Bernstein, who was Jewish.

12:22.097 --> 12:26.382
So really the idea would be to talk to him about his experiences.

12:26.362 --> 12:35.756
During the occupation, his experiences as a bookseller, his thoughts on, you know, the European attitude.

12:35.837 --> 12:45.612
He was in the Edicione Diminui, which was an attempt by Elouar and others to propagandize through literature.

12:47.675 --> 12:49.658
There were sort of tissue circulation in poems.

12:50.419 --> 12:51.120
I wouldn't believe it.

12:52.248 --> 13:05.802
Typical French idea.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.053
Can you think of some people in Italy, I should say?

13:10.073 --> 13:11.656
No.

13:11.776 --> 13:13.639
No, I don't know them.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.961
How about Otto Schaefer?

13:15.162 --> 13:19.408
Well, that's the interesting other side.

13:19.489 --> 13:22.694
You know, we kept bombing him and bombing him.

13:22.774 --> 13:30.827
I don't think we ever diminished his...

13:30.807 --> 13:33.431
Helpless.

13:33.451 --> 13:38.478
You mean it's a profession?

13:38.679 --> 13:49.114
Because it's making ball bearings through the war.

13:49.134 --> 14:00.190
The story there,

14:00.170 --> 14:04.712
Insurance's use of corporate funds in buying books

14:05.317 --> 14:06.960
The foundation.

14:08.121 --> 14:11.427
And when the economy soured, then he had to sell books.

14:11.447 --> 14:13.450
This is very recent, isn't it?

14:13.570 --> 14:14.772
Yeah.

14:14.872 --> 14:21.423
It's kind of a foundation, is that right?

14:21.623 --> 14:21.883
Mm-hmm.

14:21.943 --> 14:26.571
Had to let his librarian go.

14:26.911 --> 14:32.961
I don't think there'll be any more catalogs like the Incannabula catalog.

14:32.941 --> 14:38.749
And he hasn't been coming to the bibliophiles.

14:39.522 --> 14:49.755
Was he collecting during the war, do you think?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.499
Was he collecting during the war?

14:53.080 --> 15:01.010
I don't know.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.855
The big German officers

15:04.835 --> 15:12.297
We're buying from Paris dealers during the occupation.

15:12.457 --> 15:14.282
Buying legitimately out.

15:14.322 --> 15:20.059
Well, the German citizens were doing out.

15:20.039 --> 15:23.422
Well, I suppose it's all right.

15:24.303 --> 15:28.506
I suppose, I suppose safer might have been.

15:28.526 --> 15:30.788
I don't know.

15:31.269 --> 15:33.911
Interesting question.

15:34.051 --> 15:36.974
But it certainly is the other side, isn't it, as you point out.

15:38.695 --> 15:49.945
Do you have an opinion on how you had said to me before, and without a hint of irony,

15:50.853 --> 15:52.699
that we owe a lot to Hitler.

15:52.720 --> 15:59.985
Of course, you were teasing me and inspiring me to get into this subject, but the trust of what you were saying there

16:00.505 --> 16:16.260
is that because these booksellers came here, because they brought this knowledge, that we, we being the American research fraternity research library, were able to build extraordinary collections.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.343
Could you expand on that?

16:18.383 --> 16:21.706
And you see, at the same time, he destroyed his own book trade.

16:22.507 --> 16:23.768
Hitler did.

16:25.690 --> 16:28.993
So he deprived the German people.

16:29.513 --> 16:32.699
Oh, you know, I was just showing you the Gesamt catalog.

16:34.422 --> 16:38.849
Two weeks ago.

16:40.492 --> 16:41.794
And here it is up to age.

16:41.814 --> 16:45.200
You want me to go?

16:45.982 --> 16:46.422
No.

16:46.563 --> 16:47.364
Age?

16:47.404 --> 16:47.765
Whatever.

16:47.945 --> 16:53.074
And...

16:53.678 --> 17:02.129
I said, until Germany went to war, this was the most advanced work on inkabula in the world.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.391
Really?

17:04.432 --> 17:05.653
What was it again?

17:05.733 --> 17:10.179
Gazamt, G-E-S-A-M-T, you know, okay.

17:10.199 --> 17:10.739
Katalog.

17:10.940 --> 17:16.767
Der Wigendrucker, you know, inkabula.

17:16.747 --> 17:24.582
The Union Catalogue of Incannabula.

17:24.602 --> 17:30.033
It's in the reading room, with all those Incannabula catalogs.

17:30.053 --> 17:36.325
Here's the most advanced work.

17:36.946 --> 17:40.292
But you can't do that sort of thing and make war.

17:40.352 --> 17:44.178
Invasion and this work at home, you can't do all at once.

17:44.339 --> 17:45.080
It's one or the other.

17:45.200 --> 17:56.199
Either you've got to invade other countries and occupy them and that sort of thing, or you've got to leave them alone and take life.

17:57.502 --> 18:02.430
So the thing came to a screeching halt where they began after the war.

18:03.085 --> 18:09.034
And there was some, and to top it off there in the East, you know, instead of the West.

18:09.075 --> 18:12.620
They're situated in East Germany, West Germany.

18:13.662 --> 18:21.955
And now, Lottie Hellinger has got the ISTC going in the British Library.

18:22.306 --> 18:31.098
And she's got the whole alphabet B to Z because she started with Goff R Census in this country.

18:31.118 --> 18:39.048
We let her have the Goff Census keyed in as a basis for the new Incannabular Catalog.

18:39.388 --> 18:41.411
It's online, ISTC.

18:41.511 --> 18:49.782
And the Forges Out Catalog is just out in left field.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.050
In letter H or something like that.

18:52.070 --> 18:54.058
This is like 60 years after the fact.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.346
This is many years after the fact.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.872
Well, you can look at it.

18:57.892 --> 18:59.839
It begins in the 20s, I think.

19:00.292 --> 19:01.454
You know, E.P.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.499
Goldschmidt was a field worker for the Gazam catalog.

19:04.579 --> 19:21.405
And some of those manuscripts of his that you watch sold were field notebooks going to monasteries and town libraries making field notes for the Gazam catalog before he went to England.

19:21.588 --> 19:27.855
And I had a very nice... An excellent interview with Fred Schreiber.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.099
Fred's a little younger, he came here.

19:31.439 --> 19:33.662
Did you get his autobiography?

19:35.284 --> 19:39.469
I have an essay that he wrote about his experience.

19:39.489 --> 19:40.530
Tell me to this country?

19:40.550 --> 19:41.531
Yeah, I do.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.073
I have that.

19:43.390 --> 19:47.278
And then we had lunch in New York a couple months ago.

19:47.298 --> 20:02.428
But he makes the point that what impresses him mostly is the attitude of the European bookseller wants something for this country, not just the ability to buy books and to sell books.

20:02.408 --> 20:04.792
But the scholarship, I guess, I guess they were scholars.

20:05.393 --> 20:06.295
Would you agree with that?

20:06.315 --> 20:07.016
It's a tradition.

20:08.098 --> 20:16.533
It's a European tradition, which they brought here.

20:16.854 --> 20:25.429
I mean, they actually would come to people like Roger Stoddard and say, you have to have these books, and I'm going to tell you why, or I'm going to try and...

20:25.409 --> 20:28.312
Explain to you why I think these books are important.

20:28.332 --> 20:30.874
I mean, is this a simplifying project?

20:30.894 --> 20:32.896
It was a soft sell, though.

20:37.281 --> 20:42.786
Soft with respect to... I don't think any of them said you had to have this book.

20:42.826 --> 20:53.577
Maybe they'd say... I've done some research on this, and this is what I... Over and over again, I say that the Elder Lollier...

20:53.557 --> 21:06.684
He would bring a book to you and he would say, well, I don't know whether this is for you or not or whether you care about it, but maybe it has something for you.

21:06.924 --> 21:13.658
And it would either sell itself to you or it wouldn't.

21:13.638 --> 21:23.156
And you caught on after a while where he knew everything about books, and then he didn't have any books in that shop that weren't worth.

21:23.176 --> 21:26.322
This is the elder lollier.

21:26.342 --> 21:28.846
Bernard is selling first editions.

21:28.866 --> 21:30.229
He had a nice catalog.

21:30.462 --> 21:54.462
with three other dealers about um 20th century french first edition they bought a lot of camus and uh and sartroud recently he didn't see it he's living in materazzo's house you know that name no no i say that

21:54.442 --> 21:56.805
But I'll learn very quickly.

21:57.286 --> 22:01.632
Now, Carlton Lake.

22:01.672 --> 22:07.119
You read his book.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.303
I read his book.

22:09.383 --> 22:15.471
Matarazzo is in there, and he explains how the elder, Mark Lollier, bought the Matarazzo house for his son.

22:15.670 --> 22:22.204
Well, he actually bought it for himself, and he decided he wanted to stay where he was in the Rue de Saint-Père, so he gave it to his son.

22:22.284 --> 22:31.763
And this is almost on the corner of the Rue de Saint and the Boulevard of Saint-Germain.

22:32.365 --> 22:32.966
This is doable.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.489
But it's doable.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.543
You know, getting to see this.

22:36.743 --> 22:40.249
Oh, you can see a shop, sure.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.453
And somebody's bought out the old shop.

22:42.694 --> 22:50.307
You know, Marc Lollier was bicycling in the park and he fell over his handlebars and went out.

22:52.331 --> 22:59.363
And before I saw Berenar last time, they told me that

23:00.558 --> 23:04.546
He went out on his velo in the middle of the street.

23:05.588 --> 23:16.168
And I think nobody really knows whether he had a heart attack and passed out on it or whether he was hit by a car and stuff.

23:18.312 --> 23:23.562
But it struck me that father and son are both the same.

23:23.980 --> 23:26.563
Kind of accident.

23:26.623 --> 23:27.604
Exactly.

23:28.084 --> 23:35.712
So we were talking about, you know, this attitude that they bookseller brought here.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.774
Sort of got similar things.

23:37.794 --> 23:43.100
The infusion of books from Europe after the war was almost unprecedented.

23:43.120 --> 23:48.385
There's certainly an Eastern European kind of thing.

23:48.820 --> 23:53.073
I don't know if that happened before or not.

23:53.193 --> 23:55.380
I wish I knew more about Napoleon.

23:57.646 --> 24:01.598
Because you know the art of Napoleon.

24:01.730 --> 24:06.517
To whom belongs Mona Lisa?

24:06.857 --> 24:12.986
How long has it been in France?

24:13.026 --> 24:16.612
How did it get to France?

24:16.672 --> 24:20.397
And by extension how did it get to France?

24:20.377 --> 24:34.492
Whether Napoleon did that sort of thing with books or not, I don't know.

24:34.792 --> 24:40.077
Hitler did that a lot with books.

24:40.298 --> 24:47.565
They've done a lot of big migrations.

24:47.545 --> 25:00.020
But we certainly had the dollars and the exchange and the interest after the war.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.663
Currency, the dollar was king.

25:03.144 --> 25:07.810
Do you think Larry Powell would be somebody worth my time to talk to you on Arizona?

25:07.830 --> 25:11.494
I'm sorry you missed Larry Whitton.

25:11.474 --> 25:14.720
He had languages.

25:15.621 --> 25:18.767
He went to Europe right after the war.

25:18.887 --> 25:20.871
And he was from where?

25:20.891 --> 25:22.353
Outside New Haven.

25:22.373 --> 25:23.996
You heard of the Vinland map?

25:24.778 --> 25:27.382
You know who sold the Vinland map?

25:27.843 --> 25:30.147
You've heard of the Tartar relation?

25:30.588 --> 25:32.932
You know who sold the Tartar relation?

25:33.033 --> 25:36.098
A great coincidence.

25:36.078 --> 25:42.327
And then that business over the stolen books and manuscripts in Spain.

25:42.487 --> 25:48.176
Do you see the Yale Gazette?

25:48.336 --> 25:50.940
Library Gazette?

25:51.040 --> 25:57.029
Well, it's like the Harvard Library Bulletin.

25:57.229 --> 26:00.634
You'll find

26:00.614 --> 26:08.727
He had wonderful accents.

26:08.867 --> 26:12.533
And he knew a lot.

26:13.214 --> 26:21.788
He was a learned man.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.432
W-I-T-T-E-N.

26:24.472 --> 26:27.617
He had a lot of learning.

26:28.036 --> 26:31.903
We collected early musical instruments.

26:32.564 --> 26:34.027
Very interesting man.

26:35.429 --> 26:42.201
You know that Aretino posture book?

26:42.903 --> 26:47.631
There's a funny novel.

26:47.780 --> 27:04.085
about a Harvard librarian and an American graduate student who finds in an Italian nunnery this great Aretino postural.

27:04.686 --> 27:08.472
And the trick is that you have both the Aretino erotic sonnets

27:08.840 --> 27:17.621
And you have these Raimondi images of sex monsters.

27:19.124 --> 27:24.537
And this whole novel is about that.

27:24.938 --> 27:25.760
There's a funny name.

27:25.820 --> 27:34.196
It sounds like a Chinese restaurant offering, you know, 13 Joys or something like that.

27:34.377 --> 27:39.647
Oh, yes.

27:39.828 --> 27:47.082
And the author doesn't know it, but Barry went and brought to my office

27:47.433 --> 27:56.064
a copy of the Latino poster books with the woodcuts, which I had to turn now.

27:56.144 --> 27:58.327
Of course.

27:58.828 --> 28:06.177
You'd like to have had it?

28:06.257 --> 28:07.058
Of course.

28:07.278 --> 28:11.584
The son of, you know,

28:11.564 --> 28:27.136
Arturo Toscanini was Walter Toscanini who ran a bookshelf in Italy, maybe in Rome, and one day he said a priest came into this book and the priest said, I shouldn't have this book, but I cannot dare to destroy it.

28:28.398 --> 28:30.242
Give me something for it and save it.

28:30.883 --> 28:31.665
That's a great story.

28:31.814 --> 28:39.771
And he kept it and it passed with other collections to win it.

28:41.214 --> 28:46.144
And the two collections that I bought were two Milanese dialect poets of the 19th.

28:47.006 --> 28:50.633
I had wonderful collections of their work and probably nobody...

28:50.613 --> 29:06.310
else in the whole world would have cared about them except me and then he had this book and i heard about it i said i would really like to see it and find out how much he wanted for it and all that

29:06.644 --> 29:07.746
It had no colophon.

29:08.268 --> 29:11.896
It didn't tell anything about where it came from.

29:12.698 --> 29:16.326
It had some defects.

29:16.526 --> 29:20.856
And the real book is supposed to have engravings, so this is root cuts.

29:21.207 --> 29:21.848
It was $25,000.

29:21.988 --> 29:29.983
There was only one fund I could use, and found it just didn't all come together.

29:33.109 --> 29:40.482
So Britain eventually consided to auction price product, and it's now, I understand, that the collection of a

29:41.643 --> 29:48.930
which means it's at risk, as you know.

29:48.950 --> 29:58.660
Your ears can come in and destroy it all after dad or uncle or whatever is dead so that nothing attaches, you know, to the family.

29:58.700 --> 30:02.624
Gotta regret.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.008
But I couldn't have done differently.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.190
The irony is that the guy who wrote this book

30:08.660 --> 30:14.369
The Harvard librarian wears underwear with a Harvard seal on, you know, that you get at the coop.

30:14.389 --> 30:15.290
Have you seen it?

30:15.310 --> 30:15.531
No.

30:15.551 --> 30:17.274
Have you ever shot the coop?

30:19.337 --> 30:22.161
Well, you'll find their underwear with the Harvard seal on.

30:22.462 --> 30:28.050
The Harvard librarian is wearing, you know, Harvard seal, coop.

30:28.251 --> 30:29.092
Talks in shorts.

30:29.132 --> 30:30.915
Do you get the title of the new novel?

30:30.935 --> 30:31.596
No.

30:31.998 --> 30:41.056
It's like the 13 joys, it sounds like a Chinese menu, a Chinese restaurant menu.

30:41.476 --> 30:46.667
But it's the posture book of Artino.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.973
Oh yes, it's funny.

30:49.953 --> 30:54.880
I've been sending it around to the colleagues.

30:54.960 --> 31:00.308
I don't know who's got it now.

31:00.749 --> 31:18.154
But that was written, you see, the sophistication of this guy who gets caught in the two most celebrated...

31:18.758 --> 31:28.150
Sad incidents of his time, you know, the Spanish theft and this Inland map.

31:28.310 --> 31:38.003
And who had unprecedented access and knowledge to European bookshops after the war, right after the war.

31:38.023 --> 31:38.984
He was in that generation.

31:39.084 --> 31:41.948
Always dead two or three years.

31:41.928 --> 31:54.010
And his assistant was, you know, the old Beinecke associate librarian.

31:55.212 --> 31:59.440
What is his name?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.021
Can't do it.

32:00.061 --> 32:01.744
What's his name?

32:01.824 --> 32:05.511
Bill Reese would know of it in a minute.

32:05.571 --> 32:06.332
What is his name?

32:06.734 --> 32:12.384
So when I looked at the stuff the other day... I'll ask Bill.

32:12.464 --> 32:16.892
Bill should be able to direct me to some people.

32:16.912 --> 32:19.677
Well, Roger, do you have any thoughts?

32:19.757 --> 32:26.228
Here you are, the President of the National Society of America.

32:26.208 --> 32:54.730
Well, it's electronics versus books.

32:54.710 --> 33:04.219
I was talking earlier about this chapter that I was thinking about, about text, the kind of thing that you get out of a text, a text.

33:04.359 --> 33:11.705
You know, I was at the Library of Congress a couple of months ago, and they brought out for me, you know, this radiest book.

33:11.725 --> 33:15.349
You wouldn't pay 50 cents for it if you saw it at a Salvation Army bookstore.

33:15.369 --> 33:18.471
It was falling apart, I think, with a first edition.

33:18.932 --> 33:20.133
It was a book of grammar.

33:20.153 --> 33:24.717
It turns out to be Abraham Lincoln's own book of grammar, the book that he...

33:24.697 --> 33:28.962
taught himself the language, how to write.

33:28.982 --> 33:29.923
Send it to Cornell.

33:30.003 --> 33:31.504
They'll know what to do with it.

33:31.524 --> 33:34.267
And you couldn't put a price on this thing.

33:34.347 --> 33:35.709
And yet, it's context.

33:35.909 --> 33:41.675
The book may only be worth 10 cents as paper, as boards.

33:42.116 --> 33:43.858
It's not a first edition.

33:44.218 --> 33:47.101
His handwriting, his annotations are there.

33:47.121 --> 33:49.283
His footprints are on every page.

33:49.304 --> 33:53.488
That seems to produce that a particular book does something.

33:53.468 --> 33:56.773
for me as an individual.

33:56.793 --> 34:03.865
Richard Landon showed me a book in Toronto, Wolf's Diary, a book of poems, John Donne, maybe.

34:04.466 --> 34:10.175
He'd written his annotations in there about you really learn something from the actual copy of the book.

34:10.235 --> 34:19.290
I don't know where I'm going with this question, but I'm wondering if all of these things are at risk in a digitized world, and if these things

34:19.270 --> 34:41.008
concerned with if you even wonder whether or not your own collections are going to be are going to be digitized uh over there maybe they're maybe they've already started for all i know is that a question but it's a i guess it's an invitation to especially

34:40.988 --> 34:48.682
Well, what did the Vatican librarian think in the 18th century when they began to make facsimiles of his early manuscripts?

34:49.063 --> 34:52.108
I don't know.

34:52.308 --> 34:59.301
For all kinds of librarians when they made lithographic facsimiles of the 19th.

34:59.902 --> 35:04.330
And librarians all the world over when they began to microfilm.

35:04.445 --> 35:11.824
Books and many scripts in the 20th century.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.010
Is it wrong?

35:14.030 --> 35:16.396
An exact summary?

35:16.416 --> 35:18.943
Well, it's not the only one.

35:19.278 --> 35:24.507
Can surrogates save originals?

35:24.968 --> 35:30.938
Save in the sense that we aren't going to use them, we aren't going to handle them.

35:31.018 --> 35:35.886
They're like watercolors, the more you expose them to the sun, the more they deteriorate.

35:35.866 --> 35:38.469
Emily Dickinson, you know that?

35:38.609 --> 35:40.450
Max Oley, Harvard Press.

35:42.112 --> 35:51.421
Because all that letter paper in the 19th century was not meant to last.

35:51.641 --> 35:59.409
You know, I wrote a letter to Uncle Harry.

35:59.829 --> 36:03.493
Uncle Harry got it and read it, and maybe he read it out loud to his family.

36:03.980 --> 36:08.206
And that's about what the paper was supposed to be lasting through.

36:09.067 --> 36:13.193
Maybe three or four members of the family passed it around and read it.

36:13.213 --> 36:18.060
It wasn't supposed to last for our time, and it wasn't supposed to be handled by 25 scholars in the past 10 years.

36:19.042 --> 36:25.431
And that's where the Ralph Franklin deal scores.

36:25.411 --> 36:33.694
We can't let ten scholars every five years look at that Emily Dickinson manuscript.

36:34.677 --> 36:39.370
They'll wear it through.

36:39.721 --> 36:48.932
Well, you know, when I was at Cornell, they had a letter that General Lafayette's daughter sent to George Washington.

36:49.012 --> 36:57.883
And it started, because the calligraphy was beautiful, and it started, Dear Washington, and she obviously didn't know him as a general.

36:57.903 --> 37:02.048
And she was writing about the welfare of her father.

37:02.308 --> 37:05.632
So it was really, I might even write a little story about it.

37:05.652 --> 37:08.175
Of course, I said, well, let me ask you a question.

37:08.645 --> 37:14.219
They were showing this to me strictly as a digitized text.

37:15.342 --> 37:21.478
We weren't handling the authentic document.

37:21.939 --> 37:26.029
This came in with Lafayette's papers, right?

37:26.009 --> 37:34.417
I said, how is it, do you think, that the letter, if it was sent to Washington, how is it that it comes in with Lafayette's papers?

37:34.558 --> 37:37.468
She didn't have an answer for that.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.073
I said, well, I'm going to tell you what happened.

37:40.032 --> 37:43.276
A little girl sent a charming letter to General Washington.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.158
General Washington read it.

37:45.178 --> 37:45.479
He loved it.

37:45.499 --> 37:49.564
He called the General, because Washington had no children at his own.

37:49.584 --> 37:52.087
Carl Raphael said, look at your daughter, wrote.

37:52.107 --> 37:53.248
He gave it to him.

37:53.448 --> 37:54.429
That's what makes sense to me.

37:54.449 --> 37:57.433
And he took it back, and it entered his collections on Cornell web.

37:57.834 --> 37:58.374
I said, now?

37:58.975 --> 38:06.844
I said, can we see from this digitized version whether or not it was ever posted or in the 18th century version of posted?

38:06.864 --> 38:08.166
We couldn't see that.

38:08.146 --> 38:17.276
We couldn't determine whether or not it had been sealed and folded and waxed.

38:17.356 --> 38:23.082
And so I'm going to have to check the document itself and get back to you on that.

38:23.102 --> 38:27.948
In other words, we couldn't determine whether we're back to the original.

38:27.968 --> 38:28.548
That's too bad.

38:28.569 --> 38:35.016
That's not a good facsimile, you see.

38:35.036 --> 38:38.119
So a good facsimile should be on...

38:38.099 --> 38:44.652
It needs your intervention also.

38:46.114 --> 38:49.321
A facsimile is no good just by itself.

38:49.441 --> 38:51.304
It needs your intervention.

38:51.545 --> 38:55.332
It needs your comment on it.

38:55.312 --> 39:03.084
It's like those microfilms that need a real guide to find out where the passage is that you want.

39:03.224 --> 39:16.505
It seems to me that this is the old part of the issue.

39:17.586 --> 39:23.175
The serious part of the issue is what lasts.

39:23.155 --> 39:33.728
The exhibition room is full of incunabula.

39:33.768 --> 39:43.240
They're very simple-minded and single-minded about

39:43.220 --> 39:57.246
the materials that they made paper out of in the 15th century and most of it

39:57.614 --> 40:00.017
is going to outlast everything.

40:05.325 --> 40:11.713
Now you can microfilm one of those in funerals.

40:11.733 --> 40:15.378
And microfilm has a pretty, you should check this up though with people who know.

40:15.419 --> 40:23.790
Microfilm has a pretty long history of stability.

40:23.770 --> 40:25.713
if it's this silver halide.

40:25.993 --> 40:34.286
And that would be serious for you to hear about the two kinds of microfilms from somebody who knows something about them, and I don't.

40:38.733 --> 40:41.998
But that has a long history of

40:41.978 --> 40:52.907
stability, preservation, and, what do you call it, a conversion.

40:52.927 --> 41:02.956
You print microfilm on paper, print it on microfilm, go to positive and negative to positive, you know, all that stuff.

41:02.976 --> 41:04.137
We understand the process.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.179
We understand the process.

41:06.219 --> 41:07.120
Well, it's not that.

41:07.300 --> 41:11.023
It's the stability of the result of that process.

41:11.611 --> 41:32.725
so that a lot of people have put their resources into making microphones with the hope that they were going to last and outlast a lot of the paper that books are printed on.

41:32.705 --> 41:38.539
In modern times.

41:39.823 --> 41:46.900
I heard a colleague talk about collecting comic books yesterday in science fiction.

41:47.082 --> 42:01.587
And I don't know much about those, but I've seen a lot of the paper, the comic books printed on it.

42:01.607 --> 42:09.681
Do you think these science fiction books and comic books were any different from the letter to your Uncle Harry that was maybe meant to be read two or three times and then discarded?

42:09.661 --> 42:18.572
Well, the one thing about your letter to Uncle Harry in 1850 is if you don't handle it a lot, it's okay.

42:21.195 --> 42:33.610
If you can find some way to put it in a neutral folder in a reasonable atmosphere and somehow reduce the number of people who handle it, that's my mother for me.

42:33.590 --> 42:40.901
He's going to be there to check up the microfilm when there's some question that doesn't answer for him.

42:42.363 --> 42:59.007
But I have my doubts about collecting comic books today and preserving them 25 years because of the paper problem.

42:59.324 --> 43:02.911
Not because of the cultural worth of that.

43:02.931 --> 43:03.933
I'm not talking about that.

43:04.093 --> 43:06.057
A lot of incanabula is junk.

43:06.277 --> 43:06.898
Who cares?

43:06.918 --> 43:08.702
It's just old.

43:09.824 --> 43:10.285
Old stuff.

43:10.485 --> 43:14.192
People understand that, do they?

43:14.573 --> 43:17.539
Not many people understand that a lot of incanabula is junk.

43:17.559 --> 43:20.404
Oh, I think a lot of people understand that...

43:20.587 --> 43:28.735
a lot of buildings, and a lot of sculpture, and a lot of painting, and a lot of literature, and a lot of books are junk.

43:28.755 --> 43:32.159
A lot of them are old.

43:32.199 --> 43:36.783
But, what do you do about the color books?

43:36.963 --> 43:38.965
I don't know.

43:39.986 --> 43:46.693
Is that a color microfilm, is there?

43:46.873 --> 43:47.674
Or is there?

43:48.059 --> 43:54.618
Well, I think when you get into color, you're in trouble on longevity.

43:54.939 --> 43:56.624
The dyes don't stand up.

43:57.326 --> 44:02.862
Longevity.

44:03.128 --> 44:11.178
I believe that our CDs that we listen to at home are going to play out.

44:12.159 --> 44:13.781
We know that already, by the way.

44:13.841 --> 44:25.274
I think there'll come that moment when that $12 CD that I bought doesn't give me anything in the machine, and I throw it away.

44:25.294 --> 44:28.478
What do you do about that?

44:28.593 --> 44:32.377
This is a print out of some master.

44:34.640 --> 44:35.681
How's the master doing?

44:35.721 --> 44:37.463
I don't know.

44:37.724 --> 44:39.025
Well, it goes back to a question.

44:39.045 --> 44:43.610
I don't know if you're an executive at the record company.

44:43.690 --> 44:45.673
You know you're selling things that are going to be used up.

44:45.693 --> 44:46.394
That's okay.

44:46.434 --> 44:51.780
A lot of people sell things that are used up that have a shelf life or whatever.

44:52.441 --> 44:54.583
But how are things back in the vaults?

44:55.492 --> 45:03.522
I mean, when I go back to the record store, saying, you know, 20 years ago I got this CD and it's no good anymore, I want to replace it.

45:03.542 --> 45:08.508
Did you have the masters that were going to produce the replacement copy for me or not?

45:08.588 --> 45:10.290
I don't know.

45:10.731 --> 45:16.538
Maybe your masters are in a different category from my print.

45:16.558 --> 45:18.040
In my microfilm, they're not.

45:19.589 --> 45:37.547
if i lose my microfilm i can go back to you and you can credit i think right i don't know if you can do that with your i don't know i'm stupid i don't know well but you take it one step further to what's behind the digitized

45:38.540 --> 45:40.042
What is it on?

45:40.062 --> 45:40.803
What's the material?

45:41.023 --> 45:43.727
You mean the CD?

45:44.468 --> 45:47.612
There's a master somewhere.

45:47.913 --> 45:48.654
We don't know.

45:49.094 --> 45:51.457
What's it on?

45:51.578 --> 45:52.639
It varies.

45:52.779 --> 45:56.004
Now, is it on the high-grade amp and rag paper?

45:56.324 --> 46:00.329
I asked the woman at Cornell this precise question.

46:00.349 --> 46:06.758
I said, right here on this campus, I am here with thousands of perforated

46:06.738 --> 46:13.867
that are worthless, that you can't read because you don't have the equipment.

46:14.908 --> 46:15.889
She said, you're right.

46:15.909 --> 46:16.890
You're absolutely right.

46:16.930 --> 46:23.899
She said, but what does go through generation from generation?

46:23.919 --> 46:25.141
It's all zeros and ones.

46:25.181 --> 46:30.968
That's going to be the title of this chapter, zeros and ones, which is the whole essence of digitization.

46:30.988 --> 46:33.070
It's all reduced to zeros and ones.

46:33.090 --> 46:36.154
It doesn't matter how you store it, what the archival copy is.

46:36.134 --> 46:42.389
whether it's an operating system that's obsolete 10 years after it's introduced.

46:42.890 --> 46:48.202
Well, I would say it matters what the card is made of.

46:48.303 --> 46:52.412
I would say it matters what that card is made of.

46:52.452 --> 46:54.497
As long as you migrate it.

46:54.477 --> 46:59.004
Migrated is the word they use from system to system.

46:59.805 --> 47:01.849
What is the ultimate, though?

47:01.869 --> 47:02.550
You've got me.

47:02.590 --> 47:03.551
That's why I say this.

47:03.571 --> 47:04.453
What's the ultimate?

47:04.473 --> 47:06.916
Because it has to be an archival copy.

47:07.037 --> 47:15.470
And if the ultimate backup is a nice German incunable of the 1470s, I'll say, well, you're in pretty good shape, fella.

47:15.490 --> 47:22.020
I mean, you lose all the prints and the copies, and you're going to be able to go back and start again.

47:22.220 --> 47:42.102
But if the ultimate backup is a comic book from 1935, or something like a CD-ROM, or something like a microfilm that's in color, I will say, you're in trouble.

47:43.297 --> 47:44.399
I mean, you're okay today.

47:44.459 --> 47:48.324
I mean, you can sell your product in the shop and show it to your student.

47:49.606 --> 47:52.389
But 20 years hence, you may be in trouble.

47:52.410 --> 47:53.591
You may lose it.

47:53.771 --> 48:03.685
Okay, but when we were walking on the street, we were talking about the last couple of years, and we were talking about how various institutions are

48:03.665 --> 48:14.780
Assuming that there is an archival copy someplace, and so they dispose of theirs.

48:15.420 --> 48:19.526
But there's nothing systematic to ensure that there are attractions.

48:19.546 --> 48:24.272
Well, you have a guide to micro, you know,

48:24.252 --> 48:27.297
I don't know what they call them, film or form of masters.

48:28.498 --> 48:36.951
You and I are in a library, and we've got some books on their last legs.

48:37.472 --> 48:38.493
We don't have much money.

48:38.513 --> 48:40.557
I wonder what to do.

48:41.758 --> 48:42.720
We can go into this file.

48:43.641 --> 48:44.983
We'll find it.

48:45.264 --> 48:46.505
Book one, Iowa.

48:47.447 --> 48:51.493
Microfilmed it.

48:51.513 --> 48:52.875
We can go to them.

48:54.408 --> 49:01.998
And for the cost of positive print, you can buy a microphone.

49:02.839 --> 49:04.381
Throw the book away.

49:05.142 --> 49:05.623
Buy that.

49:05.703 --> 49:08.247
You get terrific value.

49:08.567 --> 49:08.847
See?

49:09.488 --> 49:10.890
It's probably not that bad.

49:10.930 --> 49:19.622
This is exchanging knowledge about archives of microphone masters.

49:20.210 --> 49:22.654
This has gone for some years now.

49:23.074 --> 49:26.740
We had a little paperback book, and now I think it's probably online.

49:27.562 --> 49:32.149
It's not my line of work, but I know about the beginning of it.

49:32.249 --> 49:32.589
It's good.

49:34.532 --> 49:36.796
It's a library economy.

49:36.856 --> 49:39.480
You know, in our little library, we've got not much money.

49:39.500 --> 49:40.342
We've got these problems.

49:40.402 --> 49:43.787
This is an economic way of solving them.

49:43.767 --> 49:50.598
Do you feel that there should be some kind of policy to ensure that there is a last book in some place, in every book?

49:51.399 --> 49:57.349
And maybe some books belong in a digitized form.

49:57.409 --> 49:59.893
And to be lost.

50:00.153 --> 50:01.936
And to be lost as an artifact.

50:02.237 --> 50:04.240
To be lost in digitization.

50:04.220 --> 50:08.625
I mean, captured in some master that doesn't survive and is gone.

50:08.845 --> 50:10.867
That's right.

50:10.987 --> 50:13.991
I mean, Shakespeare exists only in print.

50:14.011 --> 50:16.694
For example, we have no manuscripts, I guess.

50:16.714 --> 50:27.325
Wouldn't it be nice to use the manuscripts, the true original copies, as they say, in the first folio, for which the first, you know, I mean, it survives only in that form.

50:27.760 --> 50:32.270
We're thrilled that we have that form.

50:32.410 --> 50:39.365
That's one example, I guess.

50:39.666 --> 50:42.833
You feel that there should be a last copy of every book.

50:43.218 --> 50:44.400
some place.

50:44.480 --> 50:54.840
Harvard seems to be dealing in part, you know, you don't see accession books so far as I know, and you sort of keep them, you send them out to South Grove and elsewhere, and there they are.

50:55.481 --> 51:01.092
You're not taking them out to the landfill, not digitizing them so far as I know, and then

51:01.072 --> 51:16.414
Have you encountered an MLA statement about preservation of books in original form?

51:16.394 --> 51:17.175
No.

51:17.936 --> 51:19.819
Well, you must dig that out.

51:20.380 --> 51:22.923
And I wish I could help you to find it, and I can't.

51:23.063 --> 51:25.346
All right.

51:25.427 --> 51:37.804
If you get stuck on the corner of the line, Alice Schreier at Chicago had to do with it.

51:38.284 --> 51:42.190
Alice Schreier publicized it.

51:42.530 --> 51:43.752
Oh, good.

51:44.339 --> 51:50.567
If you can't find it through indexes in MLA, she will help you with it.

51:51.448 --> 52:11.072
The statement on preservation of originals, which are into, reduced to an argument between

52:11.558 --> 52:16.453
An idealist statement that said, preserve everything and make sure you do.

52:16.774 --> 52:21.047
And one that said, there's not enough energy to do that.

52:21.107 --> 52:24.758
As usual, choices must be made.

52:26.459 --> 52:31.165
And this is right on, I think, right on your chapter.

52:33.248 --> 52:40.077
But I would hope that you could go beyond the published statement to the debate that was behind it.

52:40.558 --> 52:46.385
And I think you'll be amused by that.

52:47.487 --> 52:51.392
What I'm saying is don't settle for the printed version.

52:51.432 --> 52:54.576
Go back and see how that came about.

52:55.012 --> 52:59.317
and see what you can reconstruct of the two sides.

52:59.337 --> 53:02.662
But that's where you're at.

53:02.802 --> 53:03.803
That's where you're at.

53:04.143 --> 53:07.948
There's a pretty sophisticated investigation of this, I think.

53:07.968 --> 53:09.450
I really am talking to people on this.

53:10.311 --> 53:20.264
Yeah, but I think this, since it's national and American, and it comes out of the community of scholars, I think it is amusing.

53:20.304 --> 53:21.685
There are two things going on here.

53:21.725 --> 53:23.027
One is...

53:23.480 --> 53:33.456
the preservation of the original in the form in which it existed, that account book of Ezra Cornell,

53:34.516 --> 54:00.456
a letter from lafayette's daughter and the comic book and some kind of rendition of that which can prima facie outlast that original this is your microfilm and before your lithograph facsimile and your engraved and woodcut facsimile

54:02.647 --> 54:09.201
And many of the wonderful 16th century books with white line woodcuts of inscriptions on tombstones.

54:09.301 --> 54:14.411
And those are about 15 folios.

54:14.512 --> 54:23.490
And it'll be interesting to see your take on all this.

54:23.470 --> 54:36.912
But particularly interesting to see your reportage on the permanence, the durability, the viability of media.

54:40.558 --> 54:49.512
You know, they ran out of good stuff to make paper in the Thirty Years War, and as a result, Kepler and all kinds of wonderful science books are...

54:49.492 --> 54:55.902
printed on paper that has turned gray or black.

54:57.003 --> 55:03.393
Reduction of legibility against the black ink, you know.

55:03.413 --> 55:08.260
I don't think they're breaking up in pieces and flaking away.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.603
They're losing their legibility.

55:10.684 --> 55:11.946
They look horrible.

55:12.126 --> 55:15.651
They look as if they're about to die, but they don't seem to be dying.

55:17.032 --> 55:23.719
It's the other way, you know, on this 19th, 20th century paper.

55:23.739 --> 55:40.938
And I don't know how much of it is just going to flake away before an inexpensive process is found to freeze it in viability by the carload.

55:41.298 --> 55:44.642
I know your German friends may have solved it.

55:45.415 --> 55:54.927
We didn't have a very good time of it at LC with this check process, which blew up a couple times in the Kennedy place.

55:55.067 --> 56:00.794
Remember, it was a lucky for us we didn't blow up some people.

56:01.555 --> 56:07.142
At least it was just the lab that blew up.

56:09.846 --> 56:11.828
But that's the science

56:12.550 --> 56:26.931
For instance if you buy

56:27.923 --> 56:44.106
If you buy an African or a Portuguese or a Spanish book today, can you treat it when you buy it so that you get an extra 25 years?

56:47.130 --> 56:48.852
Is that possible?

56:48.872 --> 56:51.656
What if you get 25 years more out of anything?

56:51.977 --> 56:52.918
You're ahead.

56:53.523 --> 56:58.333
And maybe in the meantime, you can discover something else that will help you to save it another 50 years.

56:58.534 --> 56:59.877
I've got to talk to this woman.

56:59.897 --> 57:03.084
I've got to talk to this woman you... Well, she's not the only one.

57:03.144 --> 57:05.769
You ought to finally get to someone in L.C.

57:05.870 --> 57:08.215
and find out what went wrong with these processes.

57:08.295 --> 57:08.916
I mean...

57:08.896 --> 57:11.980
These folks in Germany have impressed you with theirs, right?

57:12.120 --> 57:15.343
Well, I haven't been there yet, but they impressed Colin Clare.

57:15.584 --> 57:17.986
He said it was urging me to go.

57:18.047 --> 57:23.373
He gave me the name of the top guy, and he said, Colin, and he said, you will not believe your eyes.

57:23.413 --> 57:25.055
They've got a splicer.

57:25.075 --> 57:25.735
What is it splice?

57:26.696 --> 57:32.423
Splice the page right down the middle, and you'll be able to go in and deassert.

57:32.403 --> 57:34.365
It'll actually splice each.

57:34.385 --> 57:34.966
Oh, I see.

57:35.046 --> 57:36.448
It sunders the leaf.

57:36.588 --> 57:38.110
That's right, yeah.

57:38.370 --> 57:38.790
And then what?

57:38.810 --> 57:41.934
And then it treats it and puts it back together again.

57:41.974 --> 57:45.438
And it's a big machine that's in Leipzig, and they've got another one.

57:45.458 --> 57:46.680
And how many can you do an hour?

57:47.701 --> 57:49.343
It's fast, apparently.

57:49.403 --> 57:50.684
He told me to go and see it.

57:50.704 --> 57:52.006
He was impressed.

57:52.306 --> 57:57.212
You see, whatever the process is, it's no good unless it does boxcars.

57:57.547 --> 58:04.414
Well, first of all, he said big trucks, and I saw it in New York the other day, and I said, well, they're not that big.

58:04.434 --> 58:05.976
He said, but they're this big, you know.

58:06.276 --> 58:11.281
They go in on a truck, and it's called mass deacidification.

58:11.301 --> 58:12.883
And they're doing it.

58:12.963 --> 58:14.665
See, we don't have that here.

58:15.425 --> 58:20.731
Isn't it amazing if they should invent this in Germany where they invent these movables?

58:20.811 --> 58:26.777
I find this really kind of interesting, and if they should implement it over there.

58:27.095 --> 58:42.199
You remember my take on the Germans in that article of mine on book theft, which was the other way around.

58:42.259 --> 58:50.773
This is Germans making doomed artifacts, you know, making chocolate sculpture and things like that.

58:51.817 --> 58:57.026
Remember that, that's the other end of things.

58:57.166 --> 59:01.875
No, really, stinky.

59:01.935 --> 59:13.576
Who's the guy who made butter, who made a heart out of butter on his wall, you know?

59:14.838 --> 59:16.120
All that.

59:17.770 --> 59:28.573
So the chemistry of the material and tinkering with that chemistry to make it last

59:29.633 --> 59:34.818
has to do with the preservation of the artifact as it exists.

59:35.259 --> 59:54.578
And then the reformatting program has to do not with the original material and tinkering with its chemistry, but with new material and its chemistry for preservation.

59:54.558 --> 59:58.086
Diazo is the other kind of microfilm.

59:58.106 --> 01:00:01.834
Silverhalide and DIAZO.

01:00:02.114 --> 01:00:13.579
And in your...

01:00:13.559 --> 01:00:17.703
in your insurance agency that you run in town.

01:00:20.146 --> 01:00:28.134
You have to save some records, but you have a limited liability saving your records.

01:00:28.935 --> 01:00:38.505
So you pay a commercial microfilm house to film last year's files and you put it on Diazlo because you don't need it more than five years.

01:00:39.426 --> 01:00:41.608
And you throw the film out in five years.

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:44.393
And you throw the papers out now.

01:00:44.914 --> 01:00:50.765
So it's almost like a videotape that you do of 24 hours of activity, and then you recycle it.

01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:52.869
You know, this is business.

01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:59.081
And it's cheap, not as expensive as silver halide material, because you don't need it.

01:01:00.043 --> 01:01:03.710
It's like saying, you should have a copy of every telephone book.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.094
It's ridiculous.
