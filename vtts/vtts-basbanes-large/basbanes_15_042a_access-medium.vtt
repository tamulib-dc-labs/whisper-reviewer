WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:14.835
And Ruin by Reading is the... Now, if it seems like we're not talking directly about it, because I read and it's my job to read the book, you know, so I'm not going to ask you what you did, that's obvious.

00:15.576 --> 00:25.790
But maybe we can talk about the concept and why, you know, you've written so many other really wonderful books in different areas, the decision to... Why this?

00:25.830 --> 00:26.370
Yes.

00:26.871 --> 00:27.312
Why this?

00:27.472 --> 00:29.835
I started it, it began as an essay.

00:30.237 --> 00:33.802
I started writing it in 1989 or 1990.

00:33.942 --> 00:41.231
I had finished a novel called Leaving Brooklyn, and I felt that I was... I wrote it in a state of desperation.

00:41.692 --> 00:42.372
You wrote this?

00:42.392 --> 00:42.993
Yeah, this book.

00:43.274 --> 00:46.338
I write a lot of books in a state of desperation, but this more than others.

00:47.359 --> 00:49.542
I thought that I was written out.

00:49.582 --> 00:53.026
I had nothing more to say, and I always have had this feeling... I'm going to put this closely.

00:53.206 --> 00:53.847
We've got music coming here.

00:53.867 --> 00:56.571
In fact, I'm going to sit here a couple of lighters.

00:57.872 --> 01:00.075
They had to put the damn music on, didn't they, huh?

01:00.292 --> 01:01.793
You'll get that as background.

01:02.114 --> 01:06.838
It's another topic, you know, people reading the music, they're talking.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.980
I thought I had nothing to say.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.664
And I've always had this feeling, I think a lot of fiction writers do, that they don't really know anything.

01:12.684 --> 01:14.005
You know, I don't have a topic.

01:14.045 --> 01:16.808
I don't have a field of politics, sports, that I know.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.890
I only have a craft, and this is common.

01:20.532 --> 01:24.556
So I was casting around for what I could write, but I wanted to just keep writing.

01:24.596 --> 01:29.100
It's like an athlete has to keep running, but if you don't have your tennis racket, what are you going to do?

01:29.992 --> 01:34.076
And finally, I thought in desperation, I know about reading.

01:34.096 --> 01:34.716
I know what that is.

01:34.797 --> 01:35.998
It's something I've done all my life.

01:36.078 --> 01:45.346
And I started writing just whatever thoughts came to me about the books in my childhood home, about what I read, about what it's all, what the act is.

01:45.366 --> 01:55.336
And then I got quite interested in what is this act when the mind encounters the word on the page, which is not quite another mind, but something like it.

01:55.356 --> 01:58.699
And what I came up with was a 50-page essay.

01:59.101 --> 02:03.888
which was eventually published in Salma Gundy, and there it was, and that was the end of it.

02:04.669 --> 02:21.635
And then last year, about a year and a half ago or so, I got a letter from a very, very bright young editor of Beacon, whom I had never published with, and she said, she had found the essay in Salma Gundy, and said, would you consider turning this into a book?

02:21.655 --> 02:25.581
And my first reaction, as it is to most questions, is no.

02:25.848 --> 02:27.210
No, I said all I have to say.

02:27.771 --> 02:30.134
By that time, I was interested in other projects.

02:30.154 --> 02:34.440
I had written another novel and done a translation, so I was no longer desperate.

02:35.742 --> 02:39.267
And when I thought it over, I thought, well, maybe there's something in that.

02:40.229 --> 02:44.876
And I began to think of how I could open it up like an accordion.

02:44.916 --> 02:51.545
It seemed to me like the kind of piece that was infinitely expandable, because it was all digression, as you know.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.910
And I began to think of, I made a list of other...

02:55.497 --> 03:02.548
little bits I could put in, like the part about books and movies or certain other childhood experiences.

03:02.649 --> 03:07.436
I had a part in there about my father making me buy the cigars, which is why I know what cigars is from.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.620
Well, making it is okay.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.503
Ask me.

03:11.523 --> 03:12.845
And I thought, well, I'll give it a whirl.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.768
And I loved it.

03:14.788 --> 03:15.650
It was fun.

03:15.670 --> 03:18.855
It came out to more than twice its original length.

03:19.257 --> 03:20.198
And here is the book.

03:20.218 --> 03:21.639
So I really owe it to this editor.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.420
Who's the editor?

03:22.520 --> 03:24.301
Deb Chasman.

03:24.362 --> 03:25.563
C-H-A-S-M-A-N.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.064
Deb.

03:27.124 --> 03:27.885
Yeah, right.

03:29.286 --> 03:31.027
So there's the book.

03:31.188 --> 03:33.049
And this book is doing me well.

03:33.069 --> 03:35.752
I mean, I've never had this kind of success with a book.

03:35.852 --> 03:38.494
Well, it's amazing.

03:38.794 --> 03:43.639
I wish I'd take, but I mean... Well, the essay, even the essay, it's the same thing.

03:43.659 --> 03:47.442
I mean, I could pick out which is old and which is new, but I hope by now it's seamless.

03:48.029 --> 03:52.494
I knew there was no sense in trying the New York Times or the L.A.

03:52.514 --> 03:53.375
Times for the Cecilie.

03:53.395 --> 03:54.676
It's just not for them.

03:54.696 --> 03:55.917
But how long was that song?

03:56.098 --> 03:56.878
Oh, it was long.

03:56.899 --> 03:58.680
It was 40, 50 pages.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.784
So I knew they were the only, one of the few places.

04:01.804 --> 04:05.868
That's probably 20,000 words maybe now.

04:05.888 --> 04:05.988
Yeah.

04:06.088 --> 04:07.370
Yeah, it was 50, 60 pages tight.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.112
I'm never good at word count.

04:09.132 --> 04:10.193
But they took it right away.

04:10.353 --> 04:11.114
Then the L.A.

04:11.134 --> 04:14.377
Times picked up the part about baseball.

04:15.518 --> 04:17.901
When they opened the baseball season,

04:18.168 --> 04:20.310
The baseball part is very funny.

04:20.551 --> 04:24.875
I'm sure you know they always tell writers, not that I listen, because I'm not into the old school.

04:24.895 --> 04:25.937
I didn't go to a writing program.

04:25.957 --> 04:30.682
I didn't know there was such a thing when I started.

04:30.702 --> 04:41.234
I always felt that what you write, that you know a great deal about something, and then what comes out on the page is the distillation of the few pages of the vast knowledge.

04:41.254 --> 04:44.277
That's what makes the writing seem dense and rich.

04:44.746 --> 04:47.168
Well, I have about five pages on baseball.

04:47.188 --> 04:48.750
Those are the five pages I know.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.011
There is nothing more.

04:50.532 --> 04:51.452
I know nothing else.

04:51.933 --> 04:53.835
But I figured I'd try.

04:53.895 --> 04:54.676
And it worked.

04:54.776 --> 04:56.237
It was okay.

04:57.418 --> 04:59.820
I never watched the end of that.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.142
So were you actually trying to relate?

05:01.162 --> 05:02.463
Is that everything to books?

05:03.084 --> 05:03.484
Yeah.

05:03.544 --> 05:06.527
It's been called a memoir, but it really isn't.

05:06.627 --> 05:11.512
Although I've talked about it, I'm not interested in memoir writing.

05:11.552 --> 05:12.913
I don't have this...

05:13.062 --> 05:16.409
urge that a lot of the writers do not tell about my life.

05:16.469 --> 05:17.631
Well, I write fiction.

05:17.831 --> 05:19.194
I don't want to tell about my life.

05:20.376 --> 05:21.058
I'm very private.

05:21.098 --> 05:25.486
But it's to talk about reading as a lens through which to see everything.

05:25.506 --> 05:31.619
And then it became an organizing principle through which I would just say a lot of things I like, I want to say.

05:31.639 --> 05:33.923
And it's like a, I thought of it like a yo-yo.

05:34.561 --> 05:37.807
You know how you always are in control of the yo-yo.

05:37.827 --> 05:39.731
I don't know if you play it, but I was the yo-yo.

05:39.811 --> 05:40.653
Well, I was obsessed by yo-yo.

05:40.753 --> 05:42.316
Yeah, well, I was very good at the yo-yo, too.

05:42.336 --> 05:45.101
I haven't touched one in years, but... But I bet you could pick it up.

05:45.121 --> 05:45.903
I bet I could pick it up.

05:45.923 --> 05:48.267
Yeah, but you know how you could throw it out in an arc?

05:49.289 --> 05:50.151
I don't even... I don't know.

05:50.171 --> 05:50.993
Well, I don't know.

05:51.093 --> 05:51.934
I'll go around the world.

05:52.596 --> 05:53.818
And then you get it back.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.785
And it goes quite far, but you always have control of it.

05:58.825 --> 06:02.270
It's really so real.

06:02.290 --> 06:05.114
But I thought of this book like that, the challenge of it.

06:05.134 --> 06:08.859
The writing of it became an exercise in these arcs.

06:09.039 --> 06:12.904
How far could I just spin it out and still be able to bring it back?

06:12.924 --> 06:18.572
And it's still about reading, even though I talk about my mother's pots and pans and my father's cigars and whatnot.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.656
That, for me, was the fun of writing the book.

06:22.357 --> 06:23.839
And I think it works.

06:24.224 --> 06:26.670
Do you have a lot of books at home?

06:26.691 --> 06:28.796
I do have a lot of books.

06:28.816 --> 06:32.686
Yeah, I would be willing to give some away.

06:32.707 --> 06:38.181
My husband is the kind of person who can't give anything away.

06:38.201 --> 06:38.963
I mean, he saves old mothers.

06:38.983 --> 06:39.685
So I have all these books.

06:40.070 --> 06:50.342
I guess I'm happy to keep the books out there.

06:50.362 --> 06:52.284
No, you aren't a collector.

06:52.304 --> 06:53.365
No, no, no.

06:53.385 --> 06:56.509
So, I mean... No, I don't have that.

06:56.529 --> 07:02.936
Books as artifacts aren't necessarily... No, that's what you... That was the premise, but I was really upset with it.

07:02.956 --> 07:03.317
It's human nature.

07:03.337 --> 07:04.218
The passion for books over 25 centuries.

07:04.238 --> 07:04.658
Do you collect books?

07:04.678 --> 07:04.899
Of course.

07:04.919 --> 07:05.279
Yeah, of course.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.921
I'm kind of like your husband, but I hate to talk with anything.

07:06.985 --> 07:13.233
But I have collections of information.

07:13.253 --> 07:22.546
My main collection, my major two books, is inscribed copies of books of authors I've interviewed over the last 20 years.

07:22.566 --> 07:25.730
It's now number 2,000 books.

07:25.890 --> 07:30.576
So it's 1,000 authors, sometimes I'll have two or three books.

07:30.596 --> 07:34.722
So what is, well I shouldn't be asking you, but what is the fascination of just the object itself?

07:34.742 --> 07:35.743
Well I think it's more than that.

07:36.348 --> 07:44.298
Do you remember that edition of the New Yorker that was totally devoted to Hersey's?

07:44.318 --> 07:48.724
You opened it up and it was John Hersey and that was the whole New Yorker.

07:48.744 --> 07:50.346
Well, that's very collectible.

07:50.366 --> 07:51.127
Yeah, I don't have the magazine.

07:51.207 --> 07:55.753
I would just say, even probably more collectible than the first appearance, right?

07:56.594 --> 07:56.974
That's right.

07:56.994 --> 07:58.056
And we didn't know.

07:58.176 --> 07:59.558
It was a kid.

07:59.658 --> 08:06.186
I knew what had happened, but it starts out, I forget, with some doctor and a flash in the sky and that was

08:06.993 --> 08:08.977
reading that for the first time.

08:08.997 --> 08:16.011
But what I remember is my feelings on reading it for the first time, the actual object.

08:16.031 --> 08:17.494
I don't know, it's where it is now.

08:17.514 --> 08:18.877
It's different temperament.

08:18.957 --> 08:19.619
It's different.

08:19.639 --> 08:22.825
But really, when people ask me what I'm writing about,

08:23.058 --> 08:32.152
I stopped saying book collectors because it was a glassy.

08:32.172 --> 08:40.704
I said, trust me, I'm writing about human nature and the passion for books.

08:40.724 --> 08:41.065
Obsession.

08:41.085 --> 08:45.051
And I go to Alexandria and I go to, you know, I went up to part one is history and then part two is a lot of journalism.

08:45.071 --> 08:48.576
I spent eight years going to auctions with people like Carter Gordon and I went to the trial of the book thief and

08:48.725 --> 09:13.500
oh yes and i had the only interview with him you know the guy sold stole 23 000 for the 284 did you write a piece about that i mean it was that a part of the book that i would have read well there was i read a long yeah no no i told about desperation and i was telling you about the yo-yo the market with the digressiveness and the the fact that it was a lens through which i could

09:13.767 --> 09:16.570
Talk about this ironic title, Ruined by Reading.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.871
Oh, Ruined by Reading, yeah.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.233
When I give readings, I always explain the title.

09:21.314 --> 09:27.941
First of all, when the book was done, the original title of the essay was not anything I liked.

09:28.141 --> 09:36.208
It was True Confessions of the Reader, and it really was more... It was ironic, of course, but it was more confessional in the parts that were about me.

09:37.790 --> 09:41.373
Then when I expanded it, there were fewer parts about me proportionally.

09:42.475 --> 09:43.015
So I...

09:43.552 --> 09:49.458
I wrote down a list, just like, sort of brainstormed by myself, 20 titles for a beacon to think over.

09:49.479 --> 09:52.962
And the Ruin by Reading I threw in as a joke.

09:52.982 --> 09:58.128
I mean, this one would never consider, but as long as I let them have a good time looking at this, and that was the one they liked.

09:58.929 --> 10:05.256
Ruin by, you probably know, there's this old saying, no girl was ever ruined by a book.

10:05.536 --> 10:12.664
And I've been going around saying this is an old adage that I heard when I was a girl, you know, to allow girls to read books.

10:13.488 --> 10:27.944
But then a person in the audience the other day when I was reading reminded me, rang a bell to me.

10:27.964 --> 10:31.488
It was Mayor Jimmy Walker of New York who said that in a censorship case.

10:31.508 --> 10:39.717
And he was, of course, defending the right of the book, and he said no girl was ever ruined by a book.

10:39.737 --> 10:43.461
But a copy editor, because I hope you won't use, because a copy editor wanted to make it no person was ever ruined by a book.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.153
to be politically correct.

10:46.174 --> 10:50.318
I said, no, no, this is very graphic, this has to be no girl.

10:51.319 --> 10:58.846
That's why Thomas Boldler, Boldlerized Shakespeare, said young girls could lead Shakespeare.

10:58.866 --> 11:04.172
It was specifically girls that he hadn't liked.

11:04.692 --> 11:13.161
So I like the title, Ruined by Reading, and all the people who read it like it because they come up to me and they say, yeah,

11:13.276 --> 11:17.981
I'm someone else who was ruined, and it's, you know, so we have a laugh.

11:18.001 --> 11:30.894
I was signing in New York at the book fair, 8th March or 8th April, and a guy who owns an Italian restaurant, he invited one of me to come over with his guest, he says, you're Nick Bazbaines?

11:30.914 --> 11:32.216
He says, you're the one.

11:32.296 --> 11:33.938
He says, what did he say?

11:33.958 --> 11:35.239
You gave me the disease.

11:35.439 --> 11:38.102
He said, read my book, you know, and he loved it.

11:38.217 --> 11:44.585
But, you know, he gave me the disease, he said, which is basically the same thing.

11:44.605 --> 11:46.268
Reading is such an intimate thing.

11:46.288 --> 11:50.273
As Alice Adams said, he was the second most popular solitary vice.

11:50.794 --> 11:59.365
It is, people feel very passionate about, not so much about books, they do, but about their habit.

11:59.463 --> 12:09.954
the habit of reading, what this habit means to them.

12:09.974 --> 12:12.957
It's something that you can't explain unless it's to a fellow reader.

12:12.977 --> 12:16.220
You know, there are a lot of people who, if you recommend a book, sure, okay, I'll read that.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.163
They sit down, they read it very good, and they put it down, and they go back and watch TV.

12:19.183 --> 12:21.245
Then there is this small band of people who, and I'm one of them, and you've probably won't do it too.

12:21.265 --> 12:26.911
It's like reading is, when everything else is done now, I can really sit down and read.

12:26.931 --> 12:28.052
It's like that's the thing I...

12:28.623 --> 12:48.934
and getting everything else out of the way so I can have this private time sort of communing with myself.

12:48.954 --> 12:49.395
It's more than escape.

12:49.415 --> 12:50.897
It's like a little inner dialogue that is so wonderful and so exceptional.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.440
Nothing else will not really... Do you read multiple books at the same time?

12:52.460 --> 12:52.720
I try not to.

12:52.740 --> 12:54.202
I mean, I used to read just one book at a time because I was so involved.

12:54.223 --> 12:54.823
Now everything is more hectic.

12:54.843 --> 12:55.204
The older you get,

12:55.606 --> 12:59.130
more hectic things get.

12:59.150 --> 13:01.193
So I find myself reading two or three.

13:01.213 --> 13:05.939
But what I really enjoy is to be deep into one book.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.982
Just about two, yesterday or two days ago, I started Possession, the A.S.

13:09.002 --> 13:09.984
Byatt novel.

13:10.004 --> 13:11.305
I just interviewed her last year.

13:11.325 --> 13:12.386
Oh, she has a new book.

13:12.406 --> 13:12.787
Yeah.

13:12.807 --> 13:13.748
She's another one.

13:13.768 --> 13:17.072
I read an interview with her in P.W.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.695
She's a book lover, naturally.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.276
I had never read Possession.

13:20.296 --> 13:20.777
It's wonderful.

13:20.797 --> 13:22.439
Yes, I've read about... That's in my book.

13:22.459 --> 13:23.079
How is it?

13:23.099 --> 13:24.381
Oh, yes, because that's about...

13:24.766 --> 13:25.648
Madness.

13:25.668 --> 13:26.750
Yes, exactly.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.231
Well, Possession.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.714
Yeah, I've only read about it.

13:28.734 --> 13:29.295
It's a multi-layered title.

13:29.315 --> 13:30.979
I was reading it when you called.

13:31.159 --> 13:31.740
Oh, it's wonderful.

13:32.462 --> 13:32.762
It is.

13:32.883 --> 13:35.428
And I thought, now I have to go on this tour.

13:35.508 --> 13:38.514
You know, it's very demanding.

13:38.534 --> 13:42.943
To have this book, I can carry this book to Chicago and Madison where I'm going.

13:43.312 --> 13:51.517
and have this, you know, when all that whole balloon is over, they go back to the hotel and sit and sink into a long, rich book that I was there.

13:51.537 --> 13:53.844
And it doesn't let, it's really wonderful.

13:53.864 --> 13:55.228
And she drives from a lot of,

13:55.732 --> 13:57.134
authentic things.

13:57.154 --> 13:58.717
Well, I won't jump ahead.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.900
Where are you?

14:01.221 --> 14:14.162
Oh, I'm only... Excuse me, the couple, the young researchers have just found the house and he rescued this woman in a wheelchair and got into the house and that's where I am.

14:14.547 --> 14:43.997
there's an exhumation to get some books and stuff and that actually happened this stuff is based on things he actually which I write about in my own book people actually go I don't want to spoil it because it really is it's a great scene and just briefly alright we'll back on again this is going to be a quick take to transcribe now this is one of these

14:44.264 --> 14:45.446
books I can write.

14:45.526 --> 14:49.913
The quotes are wonderful.

14:51.154 --> 14:53.057
You really have a kindred spirit.

14:53.077 --> 14:55.641
How many serious readers would you think there are?

14:55.661 --> 14:59.207
I've heard an estimate of 50,000 serious readers in America.

14:59.227 --> 15:03.073
I don't know if I can tell you how many people are in this country.

15:03.553 --> 15:04.635
I don't know.

15:05.189 --> 15:12.857
and maybe a couple hundred thousand.

15:13.037 --> 15:13.918
Yeah, that's probably it.

15:13.938 --> 15:14.919
But they're wonderful, though.

15:14.939 --> 15:15.099
Yeah.

15:15.119 --> 15:15.760
I read a newspaper poem.

15:15.860 --> 15:22.266
This piece that I'll write will be in 25 papers, maybe two or three million newspapers.

15:22.286 --> 15:23.968
And I'm largely an University of Collins fan.

15:23.988 --> 15:25.810
And, you know, and I know I'm good readers out there.

15:25.830 --> 15:31.095
Very rarely hear from my newspaper readers, but the people who read the book, you know, and you've only got...

15:31.497 --> 15:50.845
40,000 books sold out there, whatever.

15:50.865 --> 15:51.546
I hear from them all the time.

15:51.566 --> 15:53.128
And these are people who are reading with intelligence and understanding.

15:53.148 --> 15:54.009
And I'm sure, are you hearing from readers?

15:54.030 --> 15:55.752
I haven't started getting any fan mail yet, but it's only out about a week and a half.

15:55.772 --> 15:56.914
But I've been giving a lot of readings, and they line up.

15:56.934 --> 15:58.015
Tell me, I am the same, I do the same thing.

15:58.035 --> 15:58.616
You're talking about my life.

15:58.636 --> 15:59.377
This is the way I was as a child.

15:59.397 --> 15:59.918
I sat on the bed.

16:00.134 --> 16:04.839
and it would get dark, or I read under the covers with a flashlight.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.142
I absolutely do that because my parents didn't care.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.603
My daughter, my older daughter does.

16:08.644 --> 16:10.385
You can see the light.

16:10.406 --> 16:12.668
How can you get better than a kid for reading?

16:12.808 --> 16:17.554
I have two daughters who are both such voracious readers.

16:18.455 --> 16:22.819
My older one is now in law school.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.202
We didn't know how to get her books.

16:25.282 --> 16:26.023
She had read everything.

16:26.442 --> 16:33.131
At one point, I took the two of them, packed them up, they're snowsuits, went down to Barnes & Noble, this was a year before Barnes & Noble.

16:33.191 --> 16:34.512
It was Barnes & Noble, yeah.

16:34.532 --> 16:37.196
You know, on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street.

16:37.216 --> 16:43.283
They had a part of it where you could get paperbacks for 20 cents.

16:43.323 --> 16:46.628
This is what this kid needed, and maybe he was 11.

16:46.648 --> 16:51.934
He went to, I bought, I don't know, I bought 10 dollars worth of 20, 20 cent paperbacks.

16:51.954 --> 16:53.196
We all read them.

16:53.216 --> 16:54.778
The younger one was three years younger also.

16:55.130 --> 17:04.555
You know, I came home with a sack of books and I kept them happy for a couple of months.

17:04.575 --> 17:05.798
We had to find books.

17:06.875 --> 17:30.975
remember the story that also hit it that i would read that and i would be in tears because the idea of this she was not a reader she was a jump a jump roper a rope jumper but it was the same thing it was something that you that you love to do you will do till you die and if you're lucky or make you immortal you'll get your ticket into heaven would be reading but i think all these people

17:31.951 --> 17:56.710
have this special feeling because there's nothing there's nothing else like that and there are people who listen to music but this is such a it's such a private act even if you talk to friends about this there's nothing like being it's a special way of being alone i think it's the only artistic exercise we really truly are one-on-one with the artist number one and it absolutely transcends

17:57.314 --> 18:09.360
My next book is going to be titled Lives Beyond Light, which is from the Milton poem.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.768
The area of the book is the famous poem.

18:12.808 --> 18:16.015
The lifeblood of a master's school.

18:16.147 --> 18:36.649
giving you life, which gives you life beyond life.

18:36.669 --> 18:39.271
And so this next book is not going to be about collecting, but it is going to be about books through the centuries and libraries.

18:39.291 --> 18:43.616
And then I've got some wonderful stories about the Jewish immigrant booksellers forced out of Germany who absolutely transformed the whole flow of books into institutions and stuff over a 60-year period.

18:43.636 --> 18:44.176
Major, major untold story.

18:44.196 --> 18:45.698
I'm working on that, but that's what you're saying, that you are able to...

18:45.998 --> 18:47.986
to speak, to commune.

18:49.411 --> 18:51.057
Now, you talk about words on a page.

18:51.639 --> 18:52.462
Do you have any thoughts?

18:52.543 --> 18:55.855
I mean, this is a raging debate, you know, and I've just entered it.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.662
I didn't realize how much it rages.

18:58.115 --> 19:03.466
and virtual libraries and digitized stuff and what will happen to the book.

19:03.486 --> 19:05.870
Do you have any thoughts?

19:06.091 --> 19:09.417
Just off the top of my head, I'm very unsympathetic to all that.

19:09.437 --> 19:10.720
I don't like machines.

19:10.740 --> 19:14.527
I like things that are natural.

19:14.608 --> 19:15.469
It hooked me as a natural.

19:15.770 --> 19:16.832
I don't like something that grows.

19:17.318 --> 19:20.403
I even like to wander through.

19:20.423 --> 19:22.607
It's very user-friendly, by the way.

19:22.627 --> 19:25.492
You can fast forward, you can go back, you can stop, you can poke it.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.216
It's very portable, you can carry it with you.

19:28.537 --> 19:33.505
And you can't sit down, you can't curl up in a chair in front of a fire with a computer.

19:33.525 --> 19:36.049
There's something about the way you do the act itself.

19:36.069 --> 19:39.475
In a chair, you have a certain kind of lighting.

19:39.635 --> 19:43.782
I have a wonderful passage in here, a quote from Calvino, where he talks about

19:43.880 --> 20:00.481
You sit down, put your feet up, you have your ashtray if you need it, you have your coffee.

20:00.501 --> 20:01.202
It's something, it's like a ritual.

20:01.222 --> 20:02.723
Friendly is the word, it's a warm feeling that I don't feel about machines.

20:02.744 --> 20:03.444
I don't like the simplest machines.

20:03.464 --> 20:04.446
The only machine I ever enjoyed was a typewriter.

20:04.466 --> 20:04.786
I was very good.

20:04.806 --> 20:05.567
I was a typist and worked as a typist.

20:06.121 --> 20:16.911
Oh, years ago in Philadelphia at the American Friends Service Committee.

20:16.931 --> 20:21.555
And I could clean a typewriter, I could take it apart, maybe because it wasn't a typewriter.

20:21.575 --> 20:24.437
But no, I use a computer because I'm not such a... You write it a computer?

20:24.458 --> 20:25.158
No, I write it by hand.

20:25.178 --> 20:25.739
But I transcribe onto it.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.480
I'm not such a Luddite that I want to do something.

20:27.500 --> 20:27.781
It saves time.

20:27.801 --> 20:35.267
But no, I think the further we go into machines, the more detached we come from the sources of the human spirit and the body.

20:35.287 --> 20:36.128
A machine is

20:36.530 --> 20:37.611
different from a body.

20:38.513 --> 20:42.257
I don't even like these expressions like we use now, you know, something turned me on.

20:42.778 --> 20:49.086
I don't like it because it's referring to the human body as a machine.

20:49.106 --> 20:59.199
I hope that I can't be turned on by a lot of things, but I would like an expression that is more physical or emotional, whatever kind of turning on it is.

20:59.219 --> 21:00.220
It turns me on.

21:00.240 --> 21:05.507
There are several others that refer to the body as a mechanical thing or the books that

21:05.740 --> 21:23.109
talk about the brain as a computer.

21:23.129 --> 21:24.832
I am not a neurosurgeon, but I know the brain does not work like a computer.

21:24.852 --> 21:25.473
The brain works like an organ.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.435
You know, it's wet and mushy and it's physical.

21:26.455 --> 21:27.096
And I like things like that.

21:27.116 --> 21:28.298
I like to wander through fruit and vegetable markets.

21:28.318 --> 21:30.161
I like to wander through fruit and vegetable markets.

21:30.181 --> 21:31.123
I like things that are real and tactile and not

21:31.525 --> 21:50.186
not coming through the medium of the machine.

21:50.206 --> 21:52.168
So my secret wish is that all this computer stuff will sort of die out.

21:52.188 --> 21:55.592
Not computers, they won't die out, but the whole, the internet and the virtual reality, these excursions and the surfing and that, which I cannot figure out how to do it.

21:55.612 --> 21:57.955
I hope that it's a fad and that some, that people can try... Unfortunately it's not, but I think in a literary sense,

21:58.222 --> 22:02.588
You go ahead, and then ask me if you might find something.

22:02.608 --> 22:04.290
They're interesting.

22:04.411 --> 22:04.511
Okay.

22:04.531 --> 22:20.152
I hope that people use, you know, like a fad, people are surfeited with it and get tired and go back to things that are real, like books, like fruits and vegetables.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.215
Do you remember frozen fruits?

22:22.235 --> 22:24.178
I remember when I was first married,

22:24.563 --> 22:26.267
and start to shop.

22:26.307 --> 22:34.504
You have six matins of chapels and a little green styrofoam basket and packed up so you could barely tear off the plastic.

22:35.365 --> 22:37.550
And people, it was clean, it was neat.

22:37.570 --> 22:38.452
And then it stopped.

22:38.592 --> 22:40.957
And then now we have real food.

22:40.977 --> 22:44.925
And maybe that's because of the immigration, immigrants who took over the markets.

22:44.945 --> 22:45.306
I don't know.

22:45.877 --> 22:46.619
But it's better.

22:46.639 --> 22:49.285
It's better to say without the plastic.

22:49.305 --> 22:50.849
And that's how I feel about it.

22:50.889 --> 23:02.097
Well, I make an analogy, because I'm a badness, decidedly male analogy, but I really don't know any men who shave with electric razors.

23:02.465 --> 23:11.904
You know, when you think that this came in and it was supposed to be, and you see them and they're supposed to be cleaner, I guess, and they're faster, and they're not sloppy, it's not wet.

23:12.204 --> 23:13.106
But wet is better.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.449
There's just no getting allowed.

23:14.469 --> 23:16.673
Yeah, my husband shaves with a real razor, too.

23:16.713 --> 23:17.435
The white stuff.

23:17.455 --> 23:21.503
And it was really a sensual kind of thing to get your place wet and you see it.

23:21.736 --> 23:36.917
open up and you go through this ritual, and instead of zing, zing, zing, I just don't see that ever replacing, but it certainly represents a quantum leap forward, technologically, I guess.

23:37.017 --> 23:37.758
It's the same thing.

23:37.778 --> 23:39.641
I really think it is.

23:39.801 --> 23:41.483
It is.

23:42.813 --> 23:45.797
I did a search the other night.

23:45.898 --> 23:48.622
You were talking about information.

23:49.503 --> 23:50.204
Information.

23:50.224 --> 23:52.407
This is the information age.

23:52.427 --> 23:53.869
That distresses me.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.073
Information is always there.

23:56.093 --> 23:59.318
You can get it in books, you can get it in charts, you can get it in virtual, whatever.

24:00.519 --> 24:03.764
But what is important is what the mind does with information.

24:03.784 --> 24:05.847
I don't want to have my mind filled with information.

24:05.867 --> 24:06.809
In fact, I forget a lot of that.

24:06.829 --> 24:08.451
I don't have my mind forgetting it.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.115
I feel the more information, I may lose information,

24:11.483 --> 24:20.338
But my circuitry, and here I am using a technical word, whatever's going on, that becomes more and more sophisticated.

24:20.358 --> 24:24.324
I enjoy feeling I can make new connections, but you tell me two facts.

24:25.386 --> 24:29.072
What is important to me is what I do with those two facts.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.857
How many ways can I relate them?

24:31.877 --> 24:33.660
What are the connections I can make between?

24:33.680 --> 24:34.841
That's a creative act.

24:35.302 --> 24:36.985
The facts themselves are only...

24:37.184 --> 24:38.306
a springboard.

24:38.726 --> 24:47.019
And I'm sure this is true not only for a literary mind, but for a really great science.

24:47.079 --> 24:55.592
And I think that information, when you take the information and process it, and that's unfortunately using a technical term, but when you digest it or do whatever you do with it, information becomes knowledge.

24:55.612 --> 24:58.717
And knowledge is nothing you're ever going to get out of the computer.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.219
You're going to get data from a computer.

25:00.239 --> 25:00.760
And it becomes wisdom.

25:00.780 --> 25:01.341
Wisdom is the highest.

25:01.742 --> 25:02.763
Yes, and wisdom.

25:02.783 --> 25:05.908
And that, when I talk about the silent flurry of the mind,

25:06.074 --> 25:08.257
The mind at work is what it says.

25:08.277 --> 25:13.585
Yeah, I talk about this sound flurry, the mind is pirouetting.

25:13.605 --> 25:17.331
The idea of the mind is not something static, it's doing a little dance.

25:17.351 --> 25:27.285
You know, the information, say, like two pillars in a Martha Graham dance, and the mind is making little patterns, you know, what kind of little patterns can you make running around these pillars?

25:27.606 --> 25:33.975
The pillars themselves, they only have to be there to allow this dance to happen, and that's what excites me.

25:33.995 --> 25:35.878
I'm sure for a mathematician it's the same thing.

25:36.263 --> 25:51.817
And I used to, I never studied math beyond the, I dropped out of cell geometry in ninth grade, but I was always interested in what mathematicians do, and it's highly abstract, you know, playing.

25:51.837 --> 25:52.178
Right, right.

25:52.198 --> 25:58.343
Well, I mean, a terrible use of it, but at one point it seems an interesting one.

25:58.363 --> 26:02.587
I don't think I'm not going to write about that at some point.

26:02.607 --> 26:03.688
The idea that that man thinks of himself as a writer.

26:03.989 --> 26:07.273
And look what he did to get his book published.

26:07.373 --> 26:08.455
And he'd come right down to it.

26:08.615 --> 26:10.678
It's a 35,000-word book.

26:10.698 --> 26:14.062
And he said, Blackmail of the Highest Honor.

26:14.162 --> 26:16.265
I will stop killing if you publish my book.

26:16.285 --> 26:16.846
And they did.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.268
That's a subject for you.

26:18.288 --> 26:19.930
Well, it's going to be in my next book.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.572
In fact, my discussion with A.S.

26:21.592 --> 26:26.959
Bryant and her new book, and she said what fascinates her are the libraries of murderers.

26:27.310 --> 26:40.788
and there's one particular murder, a series of murders in the Moors in England in particular, which she discusses in her new book, Babel Tower.

26:40.968 --> 26:44.693
His reading is very carefully done.

26:44.713 --> 26:47.657
It's like, like you said, his library is very carefully done.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.040
So I'm really going to try and find, I hope they find out what Ted Kaczynski read.

26:50.060 --> 26:53.264
Because they're going to find where they're searching for.

26:53.284 --> 26:54.786
And isn't it interesting that his brother,

26:55.373 --> 27:00.640
read Ted's Manifesto on the computer.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.584
Did you see the interview in the New York Times?

27:03.604 --> 27:05.387
Yes, I did read that.

27:05.787 --> 27:10.374
Boy, that wasn't lost on me that he downloaded this thing and read it.

27:10.394 --> 27:11.996
Also that he could tell from the style.

27:12.136 --> 27:13.498
That's how he knew it.

27:13.518 --> 27:16.522
The ideas of it are bandied around a lot.

27:16.542 --> 27:20.868
The style, the diction, the phraseology, that's what flew from it.

27:20.888 --> 27:23.592
And that really supports the idea that

27:24.095 --> 27:26.838
A person is his language.

27:26.858 --> 27:33.404
You know, the way you shape a sentence is the most intimate thing in the world.

27:33.424 --> 27:40.631
You know, people, writers, readers constantly ask, do you write fiction as well?

27:40.651 --> 27:40.831
No.

27:40.851 --> 27:42.152
The short answer is no.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.955
I asked my editor if he'd look at a novel.

27:45.916 --> 27:48.218
He says, can't you just keep doing what you do best?

27:48.559 --> 27:49.780
I love that.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.081
Why not do something else?

27:51.398 --> 27:56.605
But they always ask fiction writers, is it autobiographical?

27:56.625 --> 27:59.529
I know everybody hates to be asked that as this silly question.

27:59.549 --> 28:00.931
However, you have to answer it.

28:00.951 --> 28:03.294
And now I've finally arrived at an answer.

28:03.575 --> 28:05.517
I say, yes, yes, it is.

28:05.537 --> 28:07.340
But never in the way you think.

28:07.360 --> 28:11.486
This common assumption is what happened to the hero or heroine happened to the author.

28:11.506 --> 28:12.827
No, that's not it.

28:12.847 --> 28:18.315
If you really want to, and I also don't like the idea of readers reading to find out about me.

28:18.455 --> 28:19.456
They should not be interested in me.

28:19.477 --> 28:20.578
They should be interested in the book.

28:20.997 --> 28:31.526
But what is autobiographical, what is so intimate, is the shape of the sentence.

28:31.546 --> 28:34.229
No, it's like a fingerprint.

28:34.249 --> 28:39.994
No one shapes, no two people will shape a sentence in the same way.

28:40.014 --> 28:41.235
And that's why Shakespeare is so, is unique.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.158
No one can write a line of iambic, iambic, quite that way.

28:44.178 --> 28:45.239
Everybody's sentences are different.

28:45.259 --> 28:47.941
So when Kaczynski, it was like looking at his brother's fingerprint.

28:47.961 --> 28:48.302
He recognized it.

28:48.322 --> 28:48.962
It's like the tone of the whole.

28:48.982 --> 28:49.723
It would be a play, wouldn't it?

28:49.743 --> 28:51.004
When you think about it, a two-person play almost.

28:51.372 --> 29:11.618
You mean people recognize him?

29:11.638 --> 29:12.599
No, I mean because he was scared of his brother.

29:12.619 --> 29:12.799
Yes, yes.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.682
Well, the whole idea of this brother, the younger one, patterning his life after his brother.

29:14.702 --> 29:15.343
Only recently did he break away.

29:15.363 --> 29:16.244
He too was living in the woods and all that.

29:16.264 --> 29:17.005
And he was not really cut after that.

29:17.025 --> 29:17.906
Now he's living in a more conventional life.

29:17.926 --> 29:19.147
Well, the split was when he found a woman that he married at.

29:19.167 --> 29:21.210
Yeah, but being so enthralled to this brother that he definitely lived that way, that's obsession too.

29:21.697 --> 29:44.560
Anyway, I think style is a great, the great one to receive.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.502
You know how you can open a book, a writer that you know well, and you can identify that writer.

29:46.522 --> 29:47.684
Anyway, they always use that on, you know, graduate exams.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.344
Can you identify who wrote this?

29:48.364 --> 29:50.487
I read that in a session where somebody's, there was a seminar, they were supposed to identify the author.

29:50.507 --> 29:50.927
I had that in my, um,

29:51.886 --> 29:55.530
But I can't do the Washington Post visits, though.

29:56.150 --> 30:02.316
Have you ever seen the ones they have where you have to identify that they have these really off the wall of Washington's?

30:02.817 --> 30:03.517
I can't do those.

30:03.537 --> 30:04.558
I haven't seen those.

30:04.578 --> 30:07.081
The Times run once in a while, but they're easier to do.

30:07.101 --> 30:15.188
When I was taking my senior exam, when I was an Englishman, it was a quote, you had to identify it.

30:15.209 --> 30:17.851
And it sounded, I mean, it was obviously A.E.

30:17.871 --> 30:18.312
Houseman.

30:18.332 --> 30:20.914
It was, you know, golden labs running around, whatever.

30:21.097 --> 30:23.460
And I wrote, this is Hausmann.

30:23.741 --> 30:26.505
And I said, it's Hausmann, but it sounds a little odd.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.947
Like, Hausmann on a bad day.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.150
And I wrote a whole other song.

30:30.170 --> 30:33.134
It turns out it was Ezra Pound parodying Hausmann.

30:33.354 --> 30:35.437
Why they gave that to us, I don't know.

30:35.538 --> 30:37.540
Well, that's interesting.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.942
You were right on track, actually.

30:39.103 --> 30:42.748
I knew there was something wrong with it, but I could never have identified who it was Pound.

30:42.768 --> 30:46.914
However, so I forgot where this all started.

30:46.934 --> 30:49.197
The style being so distinctive.

30:49.531 --> 30:53.076
You are fundamentally a fiction writer.

30:53.096 --> 30:55.019
This was an excursion, so to speak.

30:55.039 --> 30:56.842
Well, I have a book of essays.

30:56.862 --> 31:02.370
I mean, I have a book called, I hate this title, but it's called The Lynn Sharon Schwartz Reader.

31:02.390 --> 31:02.651
Pardon me.

31:02.811 --> 31:03.632
I don't know.

31:04.714 --> 31:07.698
I don't like this emphasis on the person.

31:07.718 --> 31:14.428
And it's collected a few stories, a bunch of essays, and a few poems.

31:14.448 --> 31:15.049
I've written some poems, too.

31:15.069 --> 31:15.530
And I write essays.

31:15.550 --> 31:18.795
I want to do a book of essays, but I don't have enough, and I...

31:18.995 --> 31:38.855
Nobody wants to publish them so far.

31:38.875 --> 31:41.819
Or they want me to... They want it to be on one theme, and I... All I can think of, what I like to do is anatomize a particular, an ordinary thing.

31:41.839 --> 31:43.120
I have a piece I did in Harper's on beggars and homeless people.

31:43.140 --> 31:43.500
It's like reading.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.501
Not as a social issue, but what do they do to us?

31:44.521 --> 31:46.183
If you're pumped or asked for money on the street, what is the other counter about?

31:46.450 --> 31:57.998
What does it do to you?

31:58.018 --> 31:58.619
What does it do to the better?

31:58.640 --> 31:58.960
He's asking you.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.907
And then I have a piece that's going to be in a Sven Berthes anthology coming out in Greyholt every night in the fall called Tolstoy's Dictaphone.

32:01.927 --> 32:02.569
It's about technology, activity,

32:02.802 --> 32:19.743
The Millennium.

32:19.764 --> 32:20.204
Who's doing this book?

32:20.224 --> 32:20.464
Sven Berger.

32:20.484 --> 32:20.965
Yeah, well, I know Sven.

32:20.985 --> 32:21.526
Who's publishing this book?

32:21.546 --> 32:21.826
Oh, Grey Wolf.

32:21.846 --> 32:22.487
It's a small press in Minnesota.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.568
Very good press.

32:23.588 --> 32:24.910
I'd like to get... This book is right in line with what I'm doing.

32:24.930 --> 32:25.030
Yeah.

32:25.050 --> 32:25.571
It's Tolstoy's Dictionary.

32:25.591 --> 32:26.051
Coming out in November.

32:26.072 --> 32:26.612
And I did a piece for that.

32:26.632 --> 32:28.855
I didn't do it for that, but I had the piece around.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.918
I didn't know what I would do with it, and he asked me for something, and there it was, on telephones.

32:30.938 --> 32:31.498
And I talk about technology.

32:31.518 --> 32:31.999
I like a telephone...

32:32.333 --> 32:51.651
Well, I will push buttons, of course, but I actually like the thing.

32:51.671 --> 32:52.052
You like the order.

32:52.072 --> 32:52.912
I like everything that's simple and basic.

32:52.932 --> 32:55.195
But I really like taking apart something that we use every day.

32:55.215 --> 32:56.115
Whoever thinks about the telephone is so bad.

32:56.135 --> 32:56.936
What does a telephone conversation mean?

32:56.956 --> 32:58.658
How is it different from this kind of conversation with people looking at each other?

32:58.678 --> 32:59.599
What does call waiting mean?

32:59.619 --> 32:59.919
What is redial?

32:59.939 --> 33:00.940
What do all these things say about us?

33:01.207 --> 33:04.653
You know, poor waiting is really disgusting.

33:04.673 --> 33:05.133
I hate it.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.736
And I refuse to give in to it.

33:06.756 --> 33:07.257
I hear the beep.

33:07.617 --> 33:08.379
We have it.

33:08.399 --> 33:10.081
And I have to have it.

33:10.101 --> 33:12.405
I hear it, but I refuse to give in to it.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.988
I won't read this person.

33:14.168 --> 33:15.770
I'm hanging.

33:15.891 --> 33:17.473
I mean, I'm talking to this.

33:17.613 --> 33:18.915
It's a courtesy.

33:18.935 --> 33:21.780
I get furious when somebody calls me and says, well, wait one, I got it.

33:22.047 --> 33:22.868
I go crazy.

33:23.549 --> 33:25.571
I said, you called me.

33:25.591 --> 33:29.296
I mean, you're supposed to be paying attention to me.

33:29.316 --> 33:29.476
Exactly.

33:29.496 --> 33:30.918
I didn't even make this call.

33:31.058 --> 33:34.242
It's the kind of rudeness that I think technology encourages.

33:34.482 --> 33:37.386
Technology, this kind of technology, will take your secret weaknesses.

33:37.406 --> 33:41.771
Like, I'm talking to say, let me just use you because you're here.

33:41.791 --> 33:44.875
I'm talking to you now, but supposing somebody better comes along.

33:44.895 --> 33:45.596
Am I going to leave you?

33:45.616 --> 33:46.637
No, it's somebody across the room.

33:47.157 --> 33:58.990
It would be disgusting.

33:59.010 --> 34:06.077
But it appeals to this horrible feeling of, maybe there's something better around the corner.

34:06.097 --> 34:06.838
I didn't mean you'd press the button.

34:06.858 --> 34:07.459
Please, you're not hurting me.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.960
And the redial, or, why can't we wait?

34:08.980 --> 34:10.002
Why can't we dial 17?

34:10.022 --> 34:12.304
Or the screen in your, I don't mind the screen in my pulse, but the thing where you have a little number.

34:12.503 --> 34:18.990
You'll be able to know who's calling you.

34:19.010 --> 34:19.531
I have that.

34:19.551 --> 34:20.212
You do have that.

34:22.454 --> 34:23.736
I like that.

34:24.276 --> 34:30.163
Well, it's good for privacy.

34:30.183 --> 34:31.044
I'll tell you because I work at home.

34:31.084 --> 34:32.005
And I write a lot on deadline.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.607
And I get a lot of calls from publicists.

34:33.627 --> 34:34.728
And I really do.

34:34.749 --> 34:36.050
And I know the numbers that are important.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.373
And if I'm on deadline, I do use the caller ID.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.435
Especially if I know it's somebody calling.

34:40.803 --> 34:45.748
these telemarketeers whom I rank in the lower.

34:46.028 --> 34:50.032
I mean, the ninth circle of that is where I put them.

34:50.052 --> 34:50.653
I don't do that.

34:50.793 --> 34:54.737
I say to them, whoever it is, I say, I'm sorry, I don't do this.

34:54.857 --> 34:59.942
And even if it's a very worthwhile charity, I have to tell you, I'm across the board.

35:00.102 --> 35:04.066
I just really resent being disappointed.

35:04.086 --> 35:07.389
Well, that's all the things I write about in the telephone.

35:07.410 --> 35:09.652
Anyway, so I have written essays.

35:09.672 --> 35:09.932
Yeah.

35:10.165 --> 35:11.867
And I'd like to write more.

35:11.887 --> 35:13.129
And how about fiction now?

35:13.710 --> 35:14.791
I'm working on a novel.

35:14.811 --> 35:18.195
I'm trying to write a comedy of manners.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.719
Yeah, and we'll have some serious underpinnings.

35:20.739 --> 35:21.840
And you're a New Yorker?

35:22.721 --> 35:23.863
Yeah, born in Brooklyn.

35:23.883 --> 35:24.824
Uh-huh, good.

35:24.844 --> 35:28.309
I just got a call yesterday from somewhere.

35:28.329 --> 35:35.378
Well, we were talking about remembering the things that you need and love and forgetting the things you don't.

35:35.618 --> 35:37.000
I was able to remember...

35:37.064 --> 35:48.802
Everything about my childhood books, the books I read when I was a kid, in order to write Room by Reading, I would remember these books forever because I cared so much and they were engraved so deeply in my memory.

35:48.822 --> 35:55.211
Whereas books I don't love as much or books I've read after the age of 30, I don't remember as well.

35:55.712 --> 35:59.798
They didn't form me and shape me in a way.

35:59.997 --> 36:04.681
Do you know Susan Sontag at all?

36:05.982 --> 36:12.368
Well, no, I mean, to say hello.

36:14.010 --> 36:19.815
I'm told that she's somebody who... I want a chapter in my next book about writers who have been really shaped by the books that they have.

36:19.835 --> 36:25.200
Do you have any ideas of writers who might be... Who are shaped?

36:25.220 --> 36:26.261
Oh, that you could use, who are shaped by the books.

36:26.281 --> 36:27.642
I mean, in a very... I'm going to see Umberto Leto, for instance.

36:28.043 --> 36:32.048
Do you know Stephen Milhouser?

36:32.068 --> 36:32.469
No.

36:32.489 --> 36:34.311
Oh, a wonderful, wonderful writer.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.414
He's in Saratoga Springs.

36:36.434 --> 36:41.101
He has a new book called Martin Dressler, The Life of an American Dreamer.

36:41.121 --> 36:42.503
I think he's an absolute genius.

36:43.163 --> 36:49.512
He, I bet, he writes this sort of fantastical, realist, but really fantastical, yes.

36:49.930 --> 36:53.914
And I bet he's somebody who was shaped by the books he read.

36:53.954 --> 37:00.100
You might say William Gass is somebody who might be shaped by early books.

37:00.120 --> 37:05.165
I would be interested in knowing what someone like John Barth read as a boy.

37:05.185 --> 37:07.207
I don't know if it mattered.

37:07.507 --> 37:10.590
Or Doris Lessing.

37:10.610 --> 37:12.152
I wonder what she read as a kid.

37:12.252 --> 37:14.694
I wish I had this idea then.

37:14.894 --> 37:17.097
I went to New York.

37:17.117 --> 37:18.638
I mean, these are the writers who really

37:19.023 --> 37:22.208
writers who feel their life is writing.

37:24.011 --> 37:25.013
Well, that's good.

37:25.894 --> 37:26.656
That's excellent.

37:26.676 --> 37:32.726
See, Sontag wrote a piece in The New Yorker about how she went to Thomas Mann's house when she was 15.

37:32.766 --> 37:33.307
Do you know that?

37:33.367 --> 37:33.607
No.

37:34.048 --> 37:35.911
You can look it up on the net in The New Yorker.

37:36.472 --> 37:39.377
She and a friend... How recently were you along?

37:39.880 --> 37:43.064
Within maybe eight years in that vicinity.

37:43.084 --> 37:43.505
I can find that.

37:43.525 --> 37:44.366
Not too recently.

37:45.227 --> 37:52.116
She and a friend, you know, these sort of adolescent intellectuals, budding, 15, driving around California, where I think she's from.

37:52.496 --> 37:54.439
They say, oh, I heard Thomas Mann lives here.

37:54.459 --> 37:55.660
Let's go visit him.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.101
And they do.

37:56.161 --> 37:58.504
The two kids rang the bell, and they let them in.

37:58.524 --> 38:01.508
And she describes the encounter, which is lovely.

38:01.588 --> 38:03.330
Much nicer guy than you'd think.

38:03.370 --> 38:05.012
Anyway, I'm sorry.

38:05.072 --> 38:05.653
No, that's good.

38:05.853 --> 38:07.395
That's fine.

38:07.415 --> 38:07.896
I think we've got a lot.
