WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:04.381
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

00:04.741 --> 00:21.058
Okay, well, just I was saying that we do 100% visual QC on the print of the volume, and the reason we do it on the print rather than on the digital file on monitor is because if a problem is introduced in the scanning or in the printing, it'll show up on the print.

00:21.078 --> 00:22.800
In other words, the print won't be better than the file.

00:24.202 --> 00:25.603
And we do that for every page.

00:25.663 --> 00:26.584
We look at every page.

00:26.824 --> 00:30.408
And this book again that we're working on, I think we got the title.

00:30.708 --> 00:31.569
I don't think we did.

00:31.629 --> 00:32.350
It's...

00:35.418 --> 00:45.331
This book came out of the law library of Fred K. B. Dodge, D-O-D-G-E, of Toledo, Ohio.

00:46.132 --> 00:47.254
That's a book plate.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.597
Did you also scan the book plate, this page?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.499
We scanned donor plates, not necessarily.

00:51.519 --> 00:56.386
If the book plate only designates that it's a book from the Cornell Library collection.

00:56.426 --> 01:00.611
This came out of the law school from here at Cornell, right?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.674
Right, and was presented in memory of

01:03.059 --> 01:06.825
Douglas S. Boardman, B-O-A-R-D-M-A-N.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.162
And that originally came from somebody else.

01:09.423 --> 01:11.405
So you don't know whether or not you did?

01:11.925 --> 01:12.306
We did.

01:12.706 --> 01:13.787
We scanned donor plates.

01:13.807 --> 01:19.694
If this merely said that this was part of the Cornell University collection, we would not have scanned it because a new plate will be put in.

01:19.714 --> 01:22.157
If it is acknowledging a donor, we will scan it.

01:22.797 --> 01:23.098
I see.

01:23.118 --> 01:26.261
And then the name of the book is A Treatise on the Law of Mortgage.

01:26.441 --> 01:34.230
A Treatise on the Law of Mortgage, M-O-I-T-G-A-G-E Common, by Richard Holmes, H-O-L-M-E-S,

01:34.430 --> 01:44.962
C-O-O-T-E, Esquire, and it's obviously filed under Coote, the third English edition by the author, and by Richard Coote, Esquire.

01:44.982 --> 01:50.808
That's Philadelphia, 1850, Key and J. W. Johnson Law Booksellers.

01:53.411 --> 01:53.832
Okay.

01:53.852 --> 01:53.992
Thanks.

01:54.012 --> 01:54.232
Okay.

01:54.272 --> 02:01.180
Just because of the place that I am in my scanning, I think that structuring will be easier to show you on the other...

02:04.180 --> 02:05.742
Mason Warlock.

02:05.762 --> 02:06.302
Hi, Mason.

02:06.462 --> 02:06.943
Hello.

02:06.963 --> 02:08.384
Can you give me your full name again, please?

02:08.565 --> 02:09.385
Mason Warlock.

02:09.706 --> 02:10.266
How do you spell it?

02:10.827 --> 02:12.929
M-A-S-O-N-W-O-L-A-K.

02:13.109 --> 02:14.251
Okay.

02:14.271 --> 02:17.074
And are you an employee or a student?

02:17.274 --> 02:18.615
I'm an employee.

02:19.576 --> 02:20.037
I see.

02:20.277 --> 02:21.538
What are the titles of these?

02:21.698 --> 02:22.659
Scanning Technicians.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.581
Scanning Technicians.

02:24.601 --> 02:32.189
We're standing on the 7th floor looking at a spectacular view of a lake, and you're about to... Now, you're working with an archival document here.

02:32.209 --> 02:32.770
This is a...

02:33.374 --> 02:43.570
We're working on converting the collection of Ezra Cornell, co-founder of Cornell University, and we're working with his letterpress books here.

02:43.590 --> 02:47.295
As you can see, they're very badly deteriorating.

02:49.979 --> 02:58.352
The archivists and curators have deemed they will not retain the originals that they are interested in.

02:58.906 --> 03:02.711
saving the information.

03:03.031 --> 03:04.833
Are these in his hand?

03:05.755 --> 03:08.919
These are either in his hand or someone has written them.

03:08.939 --> 03:13.364
These are copies of letters that they sent out.

03:13.384 --> 03:15.106
So what letterpress process?

03:15.126 --> 03:18.591
These are essentially a precursor to carbon sheets.

03:18.611 --> 03:18.771
Okay.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.815
Which I've studied before.

03:21.895 --> 03:26.961
James Logan's, they call them as letterbooks at the Historical Society.

03:27.442 --> 03:28.423
So these are...

03:29.062 --> 03:37.391
Ezra Cornell's copies of correspondence that he wrote outgoing, which are very important.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.013
Yes, they are.

03:39.033 --> 03:43.157
So once you copy all of these, then what happens to these books?

03:43.637 --> 03:45.580
I believe they are not going to keep these.

03:47.221 --> 03:48.302
Well, so what will happen to them?

03:48.322 --> 03:53.108
We'll create a printed facsimile of them, and these will probably go.

03:53.688 --> 03:54.529
They'll throw them away?

03:56.095 --> 04:01.480
You're going to meet with Elaine Engst, the University Arthelist.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.342
You can ask her about it.

04:03.362 --> 04:04.583
But I'll leave their decision.

04:05.364 --> 04:10.169
Now, we've done his correspondence, and those have all been retained.

04:10.189 --> 04:10.630
I see.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.851
But these, I think they're not.

04:11.871 --> 04:14.774
Well, because these aren't necessarily in his hand, either.

04:15.194 --> 04:18.217
They may or may not be in his hand.

04:18.237 --> 04:18.457
Okay.

04:18.557 --> 04:20.139
And how many volumes are there of these?

04:20.399 --> 04:21.500
There are six.

04:22.001 --> 04:23.082
Six.

04:23.855 --> 04:24.756
And what periods?

04:24.796 --> 04:29.182
You've got one up right now that's June 13, 1855.

04:32.866 --> 04:43.600
Mason, you know, the letterpress process is to put a wet carbon, I mean, tissue on top of the original and have it bleed through.

04:43.620 --> 04:49.667
And so, well, what we see is it's really been printed.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.009
Let's see, Mason.

04:51.309 --> 04:52.891
It's printed on the back side.

04:53.452 --> 04:53.592
Mm-hmm.

04:53.977 --> 04:55.419
So then you read it through the other side.

04:55.439 --> 04:56.340
And you read it through the front side.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.504
So it is actually the precursor to a carbon copy then, isn't it?

04:59.524 --> 04:59.624
Yes.

05:00.104 --> 05:02.627
And that's what it's called letterpress.

05:03.368 --> 05:10.337
Yeah, was to scan the front side originally and then went to scanning the back side.

05:10.357 --> 05:12.339
You want to tell them a little bit about what you decided?

05:12.359 --> 05:12.960
Okay.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.764
Well, as you can see, there's a lot of leap through from the previous pages.

05:17.225 --> 05:23.933
So scanning the front side yielded not very good quality.

05:24.892 --> 05:30.901
There's so much bleed-through that it's competing with the actual text.

05:31.863 --> 05:42.439
So what I decided that I would do is try to scan the back, because as you can see, there's not nearly as much bleed-through, plus the actual text is a lot more bold.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.007
So what I did is I scanned several things in reverse.

05:49.069 --> 05:52.875
So the computer will try to allow for you so it can be correct?

05:53.215 --> 05:53.616
Correct.

05:53.798 --> 05:55.119
That's pretty good.

05:55.159 --> 05:59.723
So as soon as this comes up, this is a reverse image of this page.

06:01.285 --> 06:10.693
So I scanned it in reverse and then took it over to the next computer and used a program called Image Wizard to mirror the entire image.

06:11.234 --> 06:12.375
And then I just brought it back here.

06:12.795 --> 06:14.757
And what you get is this.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.443
And you can see these are the same pages.

06:23.532 --> 06:30.720
This is scanning the front side, and this one is scanning the back side in reverse.

06:30.740 --> 06:37.368
And the difference in quality is... Okay, to do this, you are removing the pages from the volume?

06:37.989 --> 06:38.209
No.

06:38.709 --> 06:41.993
As of right now, I'm not, but I believe that these will be disbound.

06:43.014 --> 06:47.199
But does that hinder your work to have them still bound as they are?

06:47.239 --> 06:48.440
Yes, it does, as a matter of fact.

06:48.481 --> 06:50.823
But these are just test runs for right now.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.286
We're looking at the different type of quality that we can get

06:53.587 --> 07:02.135
and what sort of... basically what sort of... Can I get a couple of Xeroxes of these?

07:02.575 --> 07:03.156
Is that a problem?

07:03.316 --> 07:05.338
Can you print out a couple pages?

07:06.259 --> 07:10.803
So we're going to have a forward, a reverse, and a mirror, right?

07:10.943 --> 07:13.385
I can print all these for you.

07:14.126 --> 07:16.208
So at what point are you satisfied that you've got it right?

07:16.248 --> 07:21.653
So you're making a... And how are you going to guarantee consistency?

07:21.835 --> 07:24.638
page throughout the volume.

07:24.718 --> 07:27.341
Are you going to be able to eliminate this stuff from the borders?

07:27.481 --> 07:30.565
This sort of border, as you can see, has been eliminated.

07:31.786 --> 07:34.349
We use a filter called reduced background.

07:35.690 --> 07:48.084
I don't know exactly how it works, but it is able to... It sets the threshold above this so that this is interpreted as white and the rest of this is interpreted as white.

07:48.104 --> 07:48.805
There you go.

07:51.316 --> 08:02.894
And again, it's information here because you are not getting a true copy of the original, but it's been decided that a true copy of the original is... Depends upon what was the true copy.

08:02.994 --> 08:03.234
I know.

08:04.176 --> 08:05.558
The true copy is well went out.

08:05.618 --> 08:13.750
It's reconstruct versus sort of keep it as it is with the passage of time.

08:13.770 --> 08:16.014
I know, but there are questions that are raised.

08:16.034 --> 08:16.875
Absolutely, there are.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.459
And these are curatorial judgments, not our judgments.

08:19.539 --> 08:20.260
They're made here.

08:20.898 --> 08:24.764
If they told us they wanted this replicated, we could keep that.

08:25.304 --> 08:41.087
So you're basically following the request that's been submitted with the... It's a negotiated process with the curators to get them to understand what technology is capable of doing and what the trade-offs are associated with any decision that they would make.

08:41.107 --> 08:45.133
For our brittle books, we have determined that legibility over fidelity...

08:45.468 --> 08:47.591
will be our criteria for capture.

08:47.931 --> 08:54.840
Students under markings, you know, the yellow ballpoint, the yellow magic marker and stuff like that, we're not interested in capturing that.

08:54.860 --> 09:01.188
We're interested in capturing the book as it may have been before the student in 1960.

09:01.388 --> 09:05.914
Probably if you're doing a perfect job as it is issued, maybe.

09:05.934 --> 09:06.314
Perhaps.

09:07.756 --> 09:14.344
But for the math text where there were annotations by the authors themselves, we were interested in returning that information.

09:14.797 --> 09:20.845
So these are negotiated decisions with the bibliographers or the curators.

09:22.808 --> 09:23.028
Great.

09:24.089 --> 09:24.310
Okay.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.531
All right.

09:26.472 --> 09:26.733
Great.

09:26.813 --> 09:29.276
Thank you.

09:29.296 --> 09:43.555
If you create a 600 DPI image of a text page, you're, say, a 5 by 7 text page, you're creating something that has 5 times 600...

09:43.838 --> 09:49.505
3,000 pixels by 4,200 pixels across.

09:50.165 --> 09:56.593
Monitors, even high-resolution monitors, are only able to project around 1,200 pixels.

09:57.094 --> 10:05.203
So if you're sending 4,000 pixels to the monitor, you're going to end up with only a small percent of the image being displayed.

10:05.243 --> 10:11.010
And so if you were doing a 600 dpi to a common setting of a monitor, like 640 by 480 pixels,

10:11.243 --> 10:13.845
you'd get less than 5% of the image displayed.

10:13.865 --> 10:21.092
So what we do is we derive a use copy for display from the 600 dpi image itself.

10:21.813 --> 10:41.250
We basically send a 100 dpi version to the screen, and we add some gray to it because they're using color monitors, and it's the kind of light that is transmitted light rather than reflected light, and it leads to better legibility.

10:41.905 --> 10:48.294
Cornell, like many institutions, is moving to a web-based catalog for its holdings.

10:49.616 --> 11:09.583
So that as you come in to the Cornell online catalog via the web, you can do a search for a book or a journal.

11:09.884 --> 11:18.153
You're familiar with Netscape?

11:18.553 --> 11:18.673
Yep.

11:18.693 --> 11:18.834
Okay.

11:18.854 --> 11:25.301
Don't tell me you're going to be screwy here.

11:25.321 --> 11:25.701
Here we go.

11:26.882 --> 11:32.909
We did a search on Harper's New Monthly, which is one of the titles that we had scanned in this project.

11:33.509 --> 11:35.892
If we go down here, we see that

11:36.496 --> 11:41.261
This is an online networked resource, and this is the online call number.

11:41.922 --> 11:44.445
So we say, okay, that's something I am interested in.

11:44.465 --> 11:49.090
You could do a search for online sources and Harper's New Monthly if you wanted.

11:49.951 --> 11:59.762
Here comes the web version of our catalog, and you can see there's a hot link to the contents itself.

11:59.782 --> 12:05.929
It brings you to what is called the journal contents page, which basically tells you, you know,

12:06.550 --> 12:08.212
These originals were at Cornell.

12:08.232 --> 12:09.134
We just found them.

12:09.174 --> 12:10.415
These are the page dimensions.

12:11.076 --> 12:13.039
If there's back matter, blah, blah, blah.

12:13.059 --> 12:19.087
I think this will become much more important to give signposts to the user as to what they'll be seeing.

12:19.107 --> 12:21.971
And this is anybody who touches on here.

12:22.011 --> 12:23.393
Can I get on this from home?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.094
Sure.

12:24.174 --> 12:33.267
It's moa.cit.cornell.edu.

12:35.896 --> 12:37.558
And this is your website for?

12:38.320 --> 12:40.002
For the Making of America Project.

12:42.926 --> 12:43.928
Okay, great.

12:43.948 --> 12:52.060
So, we have a range of journals, and we've come... I clicked... I'm sorry, you want me to go back?

12:52.080 --> 12:52.801
I'll show you what I did.

12:53.783 --> 12:56.006
Right.

12:56.146 --> 13:05.380
We have a whole range of journals, and the first one is volume 80, 1889 to 1890.

13:05.613 --> 13:19.649
And I chose one of the issues here to click on to bring over the bitmapped version, the digital version of the page itself.

13:20.610 --> 13:25.416
And as you can see, I think it's quite legible.

13:26.177 --> 13:31.022
These are still images that are fairly large at 100 DPI.

13:31.162 --> 13:35.367
You get the full width, but you can't get the full length on the screen.

13:35.903 --> 13:44.272
If you were to—you can actually—hold on one second.

13:44.292 --> 13:52.922
We can view this image getting rid of a lot of the window stuff associated with Netscape itself.

13:53.002 --> 13:57.828
I think this is a function of where Netscape is today.

13:58.488 --> 14:03.514
You know, the newer versions have all this stuff over here on the frames.

14:05.063 --> 14:11.571
This will advance fairly dramatically over the next couple of years.

14:14.615 --> 14:19.221
But if you don't like the 100 DPI view, we have some other views that you can use.

14:19.481 --> 14:32.438
You can go to 75%, which would be delivering a 75 DPI view of the image, which will shrink it so that you can get more of it.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.368
image on the screen at a time.

14:34.388 --> 14:35.290
It's still legible.

14:36.471 --> 14:51.233
One of the interesting views is provided for those who are interested in browsing quickly, particularly those who are interested in the graphical content of publications.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.578
These are 10 DPI thumbnails.

14:55.059 --> 14:56.381
Are we frozen?

14:56.401 --> 14:57.402
No.

14:57.422 --> 14:57.983
Here we go.

14:58.744 --> 15:02.610
That gives you 20 of these at a time and basically shows you

15:03.232 --> 15:05.774
What I call this is recognition quality.

15:06.395 --> 15:07.376
It's not legibility.

15:07.696 --> 15:10.799
But I know this is the beginning of Harper's New Monthly.

15:10.819 --> 15:14.563
I know that these pages contain illustrations.

15:15.003 --> 15:18.646
It's very similar to when I, on my Word Perfect, want to see the text.

15:18.666 --> 15:19.747
It's a page preview.

15:19.787 --> 15:22.930
I just take a look at it and I'm looking at how it's set up.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.793
And if I want to blow up that page, I can do that.

15:25.993 --> 15:31.298
And then we can go to one of these pages and say, hmm, this looks like something I was particularly interested in.

15:31.615 --> 15:38.865
and the 100% view comes in.

15:38.885 --> 15:40.767
That's an original Thomas Heide story.

15:40.847 --> 15:41.408
Yep, yep.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.910
There's a lot of good stuff in these.

15:42.930 --> 15:46.094
Yeah, but other stuff went off and got helped?

15:46.114 --> 15:46.575
Any original stuff?

15:49.359 --> 15:56.989
For those books that were not brittle, we were able to rebind those where the paper was solid.

15:57.009 --> 15:58.631
Okay, this was a Thomas Heide story.

15:58.651 --> 16:00.514
What was the name of it?

16:00.534 --> 16:00.694
Um...

16:01.973 --> 16:05.718
Well, we'll have to... The First Countess of Wessex.

16:05.738 --> 16:09.023
If I want to look this up, where are we again?

16:09.043 --> 16:09.384
We're in Harpers.

16:09.404 --> 16:10.225
We're at Harpers.

16:12.608 --> 16:15.312
And let me tell you which issue we're at.

16:16.514 --> 16:19.899
We're at issue 475, December 1889.

16:19.919 --> 16:21.661
Okay, good.

16:23.544 --> 16:30.394
You know, I mean, there are those who say, gee, just in fact...

16:31.640 --> 16:33.803
first appearance, Thomas Hardy.

16:35.765 --> 16:51.065
I think what opened the door for this kind of process in a preservation context was the microfilming program, which in fact led to the throwing out of a lot of original material as it was put on film.

16:51.085 --> 16:54.730
I feel more comfortable with the quality we're able to obtain with this.

16:56.412 --> 17:00.297
And for some things, yeah, I think we ought to keep the originals, but

17:00.580 --> 17:06.225
600 DPI isn't the answer for everything that we're trying to convert.

17:06.385 --> 17:15.274
And for those things, where the intrinsic value or the sentimental value... Well, I see a decision was made here on the griddle, on the nature of the artifact, right?

17:17.636 --> 17:19.618
Another library may make a different decision.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.219
Oh, that's the same.

17:21.339 --> 17:25.583
But this library has... There's probably a lot more than Hardy.

17:25.603 --> 17:26.985
There's probably Mark Twain.

17:27.005 --> 17:27.806
Oh, yeah.

17:27.826 --> 17:28.326
There's lots.

17:29.825 --> 17:32.427
Wordsworth, Byron, you name it.

17:32.488 --> 17:37.192
Longfellow, first appearances of these people.

17:38.733 --> 17:43.498
In essentially pulp-quality publications.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.481
Yeah.

17:46.581 --> 17:56.250
And the originals have been sent to a... And the originals are deteriorating, and they are not going to be around that long themselves.

17:56.630 --> 17:59.393
Unless heroic measures are taken to...

17:59.997 --> 18:01.339
restore them.

18:01.459 --> 18:04.605
Which will cost you around $500 a volume.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.050
Oh, that's impossible.

18:08.110 --> 18:08.551
Okay.

18:08.872 --> 18:11.215
I understand it.

18:14.641 --> 18:14.841
Okay.

18:16.464 --> 18:26.140
What Gail is doing over there is creating an author and title index so that we can search for Thomas Hardy.

18:26.575 --> 18:28.398
across all the journals.

18:29.339 --> 18:46.404
Let me go back to... These are the journals that have been selected for this project, and the ones that are hotlinked are the ones that are up now.

18:46.424 --> 18:55.637
There are a number of these that have been loaded in a test database that haven't been fully quality controlled

18:55.921 --> 18:58.646
so we aren't making them accessible to the public yet.

18:58.767 --> 18:59.869
How about Harper's Weekly?

18:59.889 --> 19:00.971
Did you do Harper's Weekly?

19:00.991 --> 19:06.021
We did not do, Alan, what was the deal on Harper's Weekly?

19:06.041 --> 19:18.165
Oh, Harper's Weekly, oversized, and we had enough difficulty negotiating on large format material that we don't,

19:18.314 --> 19:20.456
It got delayed until we couldn't do all of it.

19:20.476 --> 19:21.798
But you think at some point you will?

19:22.098 --> 19:22.198
Yeah.

19:22.218 --> 19:22.579
Oh, yes.

19:22.679 --> 19:23.359
It's in queue.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.384
And when you do it, those originals are going to go off to the same.

19:27.424 --> 19:36.213
You know, you were talking about Winslow Homer engravings that you can buy for $50,000 for these engravings.

19:36.233 --> 19:46.144
For some of this material, we will look at, you know, again with our bibliographers and curators, what's the disposition of the original?

19:46.208 --> 19:49.772
We don't make judgments all by ourselves on what happens to them.

19:49.792 --> 19:56.259
I understand that some of these wood engravings and harpers appear.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.721
I mean, I have a collection of homers.

19:59.122 --> 20:04.888
And those probably would not receive the same kind of treatment.

20:04.908 --> 20:13.937
So one would hope that somebody is going to enter this debate, this discussion at some point, and say, you know, letting the process here dictate

20:14.761 --> 20:17.884
I don't think we are letting the process dictate this.

20:17.904 --> 20:28.014
I think this is a decision made by our selectors on what can and what cannot, or should or should not be converted.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.637
And you would hope that these are being done in a case-by-case basis?

20:31.657 --> 20:32.278
Absolutely they are.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.058
They sign off.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.941
We do a Brittle-Brooks replacement program over here.

20:36.041 --> 20:43.148
This material cannot continue to circulate, and decisions are made by the selectors for every

20:43.600 --> 20:47.165
book that Joseph handles.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.807
He doesn't make the decisions on it.

20:49.548 --> 20:57.620
But these are the kinds of documents, the titles that, you know, there's some interesting ones here, Punchinello, Public American.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.165
I'm familiar with these publications.

21:01.185 --> 21:05.751
I look for them in junk stores and I buy them.

21:05.771 --> 21:09.116
That's how you find wonderful wood engravings.

21:09.136 --> 21:11.600
Right.

21:11.620 --> 21:11.920
So,

21:12.997 --> 21:35.945
At one point, some point then, you'll be able to search across Mark Twain for, you know, across all of these and come up with a list of the journals and the articles in which Mark Twain was either the author or the subject.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.027
Terrific.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.809
This is now recording at the proper speed.

21:39.929 --> 21:41.351
Go figure, right?

21:41.371 --> 21:42.092
Go figure.

21:42.258 --> 21:47.203
The URL for the DigLive.

21:48.064 --> 21:48.924
URL.

21:49.565 --> 21:51.827
For the DigLive article on full information.

21:51.847 --> 21:52.868
DigLive.

21:53.209 --> 21:53.789
Right.

21:53.809 --> 21:56.432
Article on the subject once again.

21:56.452 --> 21:58.794
Digital conversion of library research materials.

21:58.814 --> 22:03.999
Digital conversion of library research materials is.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.460
HTTP.

22:05.981 --> 22:07.042
HTTP.

22:07.222 --> 22:08.063
Slash slash.

22:08.650 --> 22:38.320
I mean, sorry, colon slash www dot D-L-I-B D-L-I-B dot org slash slash D-L-I-B again D-L-I-B yeah, slash October 96 October spell out or just O-C-T O-C-T-O-B-E-R 96 slash

22:39.278 --> 22:40.059
It's Nugent.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.220

22:42.382 --> 22:42.602
Slash.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.705
You're probably at October 96.

22:45.986 --> 22:47.788
You're far enough along.

22:47.808 --> 22:48.649
October 96.

22:49.790 --> 22:50.651
Slash Cornell.

22:52.894 --> 22:53.815
I guess we'll finish together.

22:53.875 --> 22:58.800
Slash 1010 Chapman.

22:59.441 --> 23:03.526
C-H-A-P-M-A-N.

23:03.546 --> 23:04.687
Dot HTML.

23:05.628 --> 23:06.569
Dot HTML.

23:06.609 --> 23:07.210
HTML.

23:07.848 --> 23:09.069
HTML?

23:09.169 --> 23:11.732
Yeah, hypertext.

23:11.752 --> 23:11.852
HTML.

23:11.872 --> 23:16.957
Hypertext markup package.

23:16.977 --> 23:18.318
All right.

23:18.338 --> 23:27.266
But again, I'm raising concerns about the state of the original source material that we are converting.

23:29.188 --> 23:36.235
What I would say is that these are...

23:37.042 --> 24:05.513
informed decisions based on Cornell's commitment to its intellectual content and its holdings, and to a, you know, I think a fairly careful assessment of what we can and cannot do to preserve our collection and enhance access to it.

24:06.674 --> 24:14.744
You know, I think it is kind of scary thinking about, oh, my God, they're destroying these things to create digital files.

24:17.026 --> 24:27.079
But we are fairly careful about coming to these decisions in tandem with our faculty and our curators.

24:28.400 --> 24:35.288
Is it being done elsewhere at this level, do you think, or is it just pretty much?

24:35.409 --> 24:36.450
The University of Michigan?

24:36.530 --> 24:36.630
Oops.

24:38.551 --> 24:44.278
This is one of the leading institutions of digital library development.

24:44.978 --> 24:55.230
I don't know if you've run across the project called JSTOR, which is one that Mellon funded, that Michigan sort of... JSTOR, J-S-T-O-R.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.992
I got something on that.

24:57.132 --> 24:59.095
For internal storage online.

24:59.115 --> 25:02.078
Mellon determined that...

25:02.311 --> 25:09.874
Okay.

25:11.339 --> 25:24.600
Traditional libraries continue to fulfill their mission in the face of rising costs.

25:24.620 --> 25:38.663
And JSTOR began with 10 key journals in history and economics, in which Bill Boller, the president of Miller, was able to convince the publishers to allow JSTOR to create digital privacy lists.

25:39.065 --> 25:49.820
These are the biggies, you know, the American Historical Review, you know, William and Mary Quarterly, American Economics, whatever it is.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.985
I don't know what it is in America.

25:54.886 --> 26:01.916
Harvard provided the files that were... Harvard University?

26:01.936 --> 26:03.818
Yes.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.924
And now Joe Storr is...

26:08.427 --> 26:15.354
becoming a non-for-profit entity in which they're expanding the base of journals for backfile conversion.

26:15.414 --> 26:17.797
They must have a website, right?

26:17.897 --> 26:21.941
They have a website, but it's a subscription site.

26:21.961 --> 26:25.304
Harvard is a JSTOR participant.

26:26.666 --> 26:29.469
They must have a homepage that describes it.

26:29.489 --> 26:34.654
Yeah, if you go to the University of Michigan's homepage, you probably can find JSTOR on it.

26:35.410 --> 26:37.973
It's kind of an interesting proposition.

26:37.993 --> 26:53.414
The first phase of JSTOR was working with 10 colleges in which they agreed to take the hard copies off the shelves and provide access only via the digital format.

26:55.496 --> 27:02.225
And now we're seeing this as a self-sustaining entity.

27:02.245 --> 27:02.886
It's enough

27:03.558 --> 27:14.734
universities and colleges will subscribe to JSTOR, a one-time only charge and then an annual charge to keep up the subscription.

27:14.754 --> 27:19.701
And presumably, a number of them will let the hard copies go.

27:19.722 --> 27:23.307
Sure.

27:23.327 --> 27:25.330
I love the euphorisms.

27:25.350 --> 27:28.294
We'll call it phased deterioration.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.759
Phased deterioration.

27:32.161 --> 27:37.868
which means we ain't going to do nothing for this.

27:39.310 --> 27:51.086
I'm going to allow it to... I call it kind of the leftover syndrome, where you're not ready to throw it out, so you put it in the icebox for some reason, then you throw it.

27:51.106 --> 27:51.346
All right.

27:51.366 --> 27:52.808
What is fatigue?

27:52.828 --> 27:58.675
I assume you're still meeting with the computer science people up in Sarah's office.

27:58.695 --> 27:59.957
Did I miss that meeting?

28:00.106 --> 28:07.140
No, I don't think you were invited, were you?

28:10.046 --> 28:19.566
I think that you asked the question about your

28:20.575 --> 28:28.865
You're director of a rare book and manuscript repository, and this technology role, and the role that they can play, and so forth.

28:28.945 --> 28:30.287
And I am interested in that.

28:30.487 --> 28:35.834
How does that connect, and why— And are they in conflict with each other, actually?

28:36.274 --> 28:38.377
Yeah, and first, I don't think they are.

28:39.899 --> 28:44.845
And second, I think we are particularly—

28:47.508 --> 28:51.291
adept at what I think we should be using the technology for.

28:52.553 --> 29:04.863
Because we really have dealt with a diversity of media and information from a range of sources and so forth, and over time.

29:05.964 --> 29:16.654
And so archivists in particular have had to sort of face incoherent masses of material

29:17.495 --> 29:19.777
and to bring a certain meaning to that.

29:23.041 --> 29:32.911
Hopefully seldom artificial, but probably on the borderline, in order to make it usable, in order to make it manageable.

29:33.912 --> 29:45.865
And so I think that in many ways the challenges of the digital environment are not terribly different from that.

29:46.469 --> 30:10.266
There's a lot of different kinds of information out there, and what we really need to create are collections of information that can be used in some kind of coherent fashion that both allows you to identify the material, but also allows you to navigate within it.

30:10.617 --> 30:23.518
And that's the same thing we try to do for that researcher that gets a box at the Jessica, is that they are able to navigate within these remnants of the human endeavor.

30:24.159 --> 30:31.711
And that that is, that in fact we're faced with that same challenge in the digital environment.

30:31.991 --> 30:35.697
The other thing that we have to convey, which I think unfortunately...

30:36.402 --> 31:04.047
most of the people creating digital information is we also have to be able to convey context because the relationship between documents and that's really pretty I think that's very difficult in the digital environment and in the sort of flexibility of the digital environment it runs at odds I mean almost the esprit of it runs at odds with that and I think that's

31:04.482 --> 31:10.228
But these are conflicts of practice, not of principle.

31:10.809 --> 31:28.808
And I really believe that we enhance the value of the material through the use of the surrogates.

31:30.470 --> 31:33.493
The surrogates being the digital versions.

31:33.828 --> 31:37.211
And that, in fact, that really enhances the value of the originals.

31:37.551 --> 31:40.594
That that enhancement filters over.

31:42.416 --> 31:49.222
You know, I mean, I do not think that people substitute one for the other.

31:49.242 --> 32:00.713
A fellow was in last Saturday evening with me in the vault.

32:03.494 --> 32:08.881
I showed him the copy of the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's on the hand.

32:10.042 --> 32:13.206
He happens to be a real Lincoln enthusiast and so forth.

32:15.749 --> 32:25.241
The thing he wanted to do at that point was to lead the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln's hand.

32:29.486 --> 32:33.231
I don't think in the digital environment he's going to have an experience like that.

32:33.312 --> 32:38.357
The words are there, even if it's a really good, high fidelity.

32:38.958 --> 32:50.750
But this is about, this is a direct link between this guy in 1996 and Lincoln sitting at his desk with that pen in hand.

32:51.130 --> 32:54.013
I mean, this, you know.

32:54.213 --> 33:01.581
I mean, that's what he's tapping into.

33:01.797 --> 33:04.541
I write about this experience all the time in my book.

33:04.641 --> 33:05.923
It happened to me last week.

33:06.343 --> 33:12.611
I handled Lincoln's Primer last week, a book that he learned how to English language with me.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.495
I'm glad I was sitting down when this happened.

33:15.515 --> 33:23.626
His fingerprints were all over it, and it was an overwhelming experience that is tactile and that is everything else, you know.

33:24.267 --> 33:28.733
And Stephen Jay Gould told me that they actually made it the Smithsonian,

33:29.303 --> 33:31.085
a copy of the Spirit of St.

33:31.105 --> 33:31.366
Louis.

33:31.386 --> 33:35.492
You think people wanted to go and have their, even though it was an exact replica?

33:35.812 --> 33:36.052
No.

33:36.353 --> 33:40.639
There's something about standing next to the real Spirit of St.

33:40.659 --> 33:41.700
Louis.

33:41.920 --> 33:50.472
And, you know, I don't know if you can describe that or verbalize that, but it is touching me authentically, the actual.

33:51.394 --> 33:57.522
So I just see it as moving as another way that we

33:59.729 --> 34:02.572
increase the use and usability of our holdings.

34:02.952 --> 34:03.313
Okay.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.834
And it's not at odds with it.

34:04.854 --> 34:08.638
And this does lead us into something we didn't go over at lunch.

34:10.039 --> 34:19.088
And it is pregnant, because we talk about how to maximize the value of your holdings, how to preserve your holdings, etc.

34:19.969 --> 34:29.018
But, you know, this division that you direct also should have a mind to the things that are new things that it wants to collect.

34:29.058 --> 34:29.719
Do you have a

34:30.222 --> 34:37.690
I mean, do you have an active acquisitions program, a mandate of the things that you're looking for?

34:37.710 --> 34:48.241
Or do you feel that your role right now is to maximize what you have and to use the technologies that are available to give a wider use and application?

34:49.802 --> 34:53.286
Well, we hired a new curator of manuscripts just recently.

34:55.088 --> 34:56.449
She arrives on Monday.

34:56.969 --> 35:01.396
And you are interested in manuscripts and not books, which is probably the case, too, I would imagine.

35:01.536 --> 35:09.449
I'm more—I mean, that's where I have more—that's where I personally have more knowledge and expertise.

35:10.651 --> 35:22.150
And I usually gloss over the difference without much—generically.

35:22.501 --> 35:26.406
There is a difference, and it doesn't really have to do with knowledge.

35:26.426 --> 35:52.356
I mean, the fact is that the nature of most non-literary manuscripts is that, in fact, they were created to serve some other role than to pervert, you know, to—it's the difference between this and your book.

35:53.332 --> 36:01.762
And that is a really big difference.

36:01.782 --> 36:08.411
So I think we sometimes gloss over the differences in there.

36:08.531 --> 36:12.616
The differences between books and manuscripts.

36:13.197 --> 36:22.528
And manuscripts here are referring to non-literary manuscripts, to personal papers, and so forth.

36:23.487 --> 36:52.920
But as far as when we hired this new curator of manuscripts, and I talked about what do we acquire and so forth, and why do we acquire it, and what's going to be your role in that, we could stop tomorrow and never obtain another item.

36:56.191 --> 37:05.144
refocus some of our resources, and perhaps do a better job of preserving and supporting the use of what we have.

37:07.427 --> 37:25.472
I think the role of acquisition is not just to enrich the collection, but it's really important to the way you think about your job, about what our craft is.

37:26.296 --> 37:53.451
because it is the thinking that goes into thinking about what is effective documentation of various aspects of human existence that sort of, on one hand, it keeps your blood flowing, that you feel like you're in an active process, but also it helps you do all the other things,

37:53.785 --> 38:06.280
It's thinking that wouldn't go on if you didn't do it, if you didn't think about what it is that we wish we had, or why would it be important to get this collection of material?

38:07.061 --> 38:13.629
What is likely to be in that person's observations of the records of their experience, and how will that be used?

38:15.551 --> 38:21.919
So I almost, I think we'd be a different institution if we stopped collecting.

38:22.405 --> 38:25.909
And I'd be less interested in being here, even though I'm not.

38:26.710 --> 38:41.165
Probably for my profession, I've got less ego involved in the reputation of our holdings.

38:41.706 --> 38:49.915
Not that I don't care about it.

38:50.485 --> 38:52.467
I don't think it's the same job.

38:52.527 --> 38:54.329
I don't think you think the same way.

38:54.389 --> 39:00.776
It's almost necessary to do it.

39:00.937 --> 39:10.928
It's necessary to maintaining what we have and understanding the nature of what we have because I think somehow you'd lose some life.

39:11.008 --> 39:12.529
It's part of our vitality.

39:13.390 --> 39:17.515
So anyway, we've got to be buying some things.

39:17.575 --> 39:19.497
We've got to be thinking about what's good.

39:20.033 --> 39:47.796
And I do tend to think that you get more bang for your buck

39:49.328 --> 40:16.956
You know, that it's a kind of a petty vanity when you choose to have one of X. And not that I can always resist it, but—and that's not really building research collections.

40:18.691 --> 40:47.213
So, you should only go into a new area if you really intend to

40:47.480 --> 40:57.550
In recent time, I've been at Cornell twenty-two years, so recent has some .

40:57.971 --> 40:58.591
How long?

40:59.512 --> 41:16.710
This division, the combination of the—I was for a long time head of the Manuscripts and Archives program in here, which was about fifteen staff members.

41:17.163 --> 41:27.518
Largely modern 19th, 20th century materials, principally historical as opposed to literary collections.

41:28.840 --> 41:38.093
In 1988, I became assistant director of Oldham Library, the building I came into.

41:38.634 --> 41:46.545
And at that point in time, the rare book departments, there were three of them, started reporting to me also.

41:47.302 --> 42:03.877
When we moved into this building, and we moved in in 1992, but in January of 1992, we became a separate reporting entity.

42:03.897 --> 42:15.908
Those three existing rare book departments and the Manuscripts and Archives program, we had designed the building to support an integrated program.

42:16.883 --> 42:24.635
And I really created a separate reporting unit that reported the university librarian.

42:25.416 --> 42:31.785
And so this combination didn't exist.

42:33.608 --> 42:46.047
While those other departments reported to me before, and I think I made some major changes in those years before that,

42:46.685 --> 42:54.354
what we have now is only realizable.

42:54.855 --> 42:56.897
And I did it very consciously.

42:56.957 --> 43:12.315
I mean, I really the building was designed to support an administrative and a functional and a physical integration of those programs.

43:12.335 --> 43:14.818
And, you know,

43:15.372 --> 43:18.957
people said to me, well, there'll be no longer will there be a rare book department.

43:19.097 --> 43:28.510
You know, everybody, and well, I had been head of manuscripts and archives for a long number of years before that.

43:29.311 --> 43:37.421
And in fact, I was on the verge of being the longest person, you know, the person who held seniority, and it disappeared.

43:37.622 --> 43:41.667
You know, in terms of what, for whatever that's worth, you know, I mean,

43:41.984 --> 43:45.868
is that everybody loses something in those kinds of transitions.

43:46.830 --> 43:48.131
They're not huge.

43:48.471 --> 43:58.924
I mean, I don't want to talk about this as like it's the big, you know, I mean, this may not be like merging two academic departments.

43:59.044 --> 44:09.696
But anyway, we did really make a very conscious effort, and we hired and

44:11.077 --> 44:22.511
And, um, some of them are new and some of them, you know, have sort of been a few miles with me.

44:23.192 --> 44:31.742
Um, and, uh, so, so anyway, so that's what I've been with, how I've come into this.

44:32.043 --> 44:38.991
And so I really come from the manuscript side of our field.

44:39.865 --> 44:57.348
and so I certainly have much more knowledge for that, but I also... They just result from different kinds of human endeavors, and then they have this technical multiple addition manifestation and so forth, which then further changes.

44:57.788 --> 45:02.594
They're different when they start out, and then they're different in a variety of other ways.

45:02.694 --> 45:09.383
So, anyway, areas probably the...

45:10.898 --> 45:39.657
most distinctive new development in the time I've been here and I won't say that there haven't been others but is the Human Sexuality Collection and and while broadly conceived it has

45:39.957 --> 45:46.523
had a particular focus on gay and lesbian issues in life.

45:48.525 --> 46:01.276
And that's an example of where a donor's gift influenced the university.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.142
It's an area where we did some

46:08.999 --> 46:15.465
and prior to a gift.

46:15.505 --> 46:19.529
But in fact, we would not have said that was an area of strength or an area of focus.

46:21.471 --> 46:38.247
Some of it came through the General University Archives mission, and some of it came through the general representation of those issues in all our collections.

46:38.648 --> 46:52.068
And so anyway, we created, but the university at that point in time, it was a significant step for a university to make.

46:53.050 --> 47:02.985
And so there was about four years in which the gift was being considered.

47:03.966 --> 47:06.630
And then essentially it was turned over to me to

47:07.252 --> 47:11.338
at a certain point in time to sort of make it happen.

47:11.358 --> 47:24.398
And with a certain amount of resources that were less than had been expected to decide what the focus in terms of collecting would be.

47:25.580 --> 47:29.125
And we created a largely faculty

47:29.476 --> 47:33.441
to assist us in shaping that and so forth.

47:33.461 --> 47:39.928
But we also had a large gift of material that had already been collected by the Mariposa Foundation.

47:39.949 --> 47:47.678
And I think that program has been very successful.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.780
It's no longer unique.

47:50.041 --> 47:57.930
I mean, each year after we established ours, there have been a number more.

47:59.868 --> 48:04.314
So, in fact, there's even a competition for such material.

48:05.235 --> 48:11.783
So, we went from being almost, you know, outside of the community-based collections.

48:16.048 --> 48:19.332
With that particular focus, we were indeed unique.

48:19.993 --> 48:22.917
And so— And lesbian stuff is everywhere now.

48:22.977 --> 48:25.740
But now it is everywhere.

48:26.665 --> 48:35.938
One can say, okay, well, do you think you changed the nature of what's preserved by the fact that you, you know, that you moved this issue along?

48:37.981 --> 48:47.394
Probably so, but in fact, by the time the university got from the time it started considering to the time it decided to take action, the flow was over.

48:47.474 --> 48:56.166
You know, it was like, you know, one day we were cutting edge, and a year later,

48:56.382 --> 49:15.203
So that's the most obvious example.

49:16.044 --> 49:21.350
It's really a good addition to our holdings.

49:21.510 --> 49:23.132
It has a particular

49:23.568 --> 49:26.874
and structural value.

49:27.315 --> 49:29.438
And about when did that come over?

49:29.459 --> 49:31.482
1988.

49:31.843 --> 49:32.464
That's fairly recent.

49:32.584 --> 49:33.245
Yeah, yeah.

49:33.566 --> 49:40.578
I mean, some of the material predated that because, as I say, an existing collection was given.

49:40.879 --> 49:43.383
Yeah, and you had stuff that you colored, I guess, from all over.

49:43.484 --> 49:44.325
Yeah, yeah.

49:44.385 --> 49:48.192
We, in fact, and, you know, I keep,

49:48.762 --> 49:51.285
I'm of two minds.

49:51.305 --> 50:14.993
I mean, David Goodstein was the principal donor in supporting this, and one of the conditions of his gift was that, in fact, it not be limited to gay and lesbian issues, that it be human sexuality broadly conceived.

50:15.193 --> 50:16.795
Now, what was this, a private collection?

50:17.197 --> 50:45.381
Well, the Mariposa Foundation, which was essentially a research entity headed by Bruce Feller, who had been a biologist at Rockefeller, who at a certain point had left the academy and sort of—so they were a research and educational

50:45.682 --> 50:52.251
And they just started collecting collections of people who had personal collections.

50:53.492 --> 50:58.078
David Goodstein was the publisher of The Advocate.

50:58.979 --> 51:02.404
He was the first Cornell graduate.

51:03.145 --> 51:12.617
He was a terribly successful young stockbroker who is sometimes credited with the concept of program trading.

51:13.407 --> 51:42.992
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

51:43.360 --> 52:03.388
And it sort of set him off on a different path, which was as a— Gee, such a remarkable story.

52:03.549 --> 52:09.477
A political activist who then became— What's his name again?

52:09.497 --> 52:10.278
David Goodstein.

52:10.338 --> 52:12.962
Is he still around?

52:13.634 --> 52:16.579
And, uh, of natural causes, or?

52:17.901 --> 52:23.369
Um, I don't know, but he died relatively young.

52:24.951 --> 52:34.406
Um, and, um, I was going to say, do I have a— That's quite a story.

52:34.426 --> 52:35.307
—of his around.

52:36.709 --> 52:41.076
Um, anyway, he was the first of

52:42.035 --> 53:11.232
So, you know, he was a Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican.

53:12.882 --> 53:18.791
I believe, did have family wealth in addition to making a whole bunch of money in a short period of time.

53:18.911 --> 53:24.239
So I don't have a book of his.

53:24.599 --> 53:26.782
A book that he wrote?

53:27.403 --> 53:28.224
Yeah.

53:28.345 --> 53:29.286
On what?

53:30.768 --> 53:38.940
It's essentially, I know I'm kind of underselling it, giving it that characterization,

53:43.072 --> 53:53.006
S, sort of, you know, sort of human fulfillment through, you know, control of mind and body.

53:53.146 --> 53:53.707
Oh, okay.

53:53.747 --> 53:54.688
What are you, New Age, Joe?

53:54.728 --> 53:55.029
Yeah, New Age.

53:55.650 --> 53:57.552
Only before New Age.

53:57.813 --> 53:58.534
Before the term.

53:58.554 --> 53:59.495
I can find it, though.

53:59.515 --> 54:03.941
Yeah, you'll find it in David Goodstein.

54:03.961 --> 54:07.106
G-O-O-D-S-T-E-I-N.

54:07.126 --> 54:07.586
About when?

54:08.047 --> 54:09.749
About when did you say?

54:09.769 --> 54:12.353
52, maybe, or something like that.

54:14.965 --> 54:17.451
He must have been in who's who of his period then.

54:17.551 --> 54:17.892
Yeah.

54:17.973 --> 54:19.015
How recently did he die?

54:20.218 --> 54:23.326
He died in 1980, 1987.

54:23.346 --> 54:28.519
35 years old.

54:30.355 --> 54:35.182
Well, no, when I said 52, that's his class at Cornell.

54:35.242 --> 54:37.185
So he's got another 22 years.

54:37.225 --> 54:38.627
Math is my worst thing.

54:39.588 --> 54:40.429
Not that young man.

54:40.469 --> 54:42.072
So he was in his 50s.

54:42.152 --> 54:45.336
Excuse me about that.

54:45.957 --> 54:46.999
No problem.

54:47.139 --> 54:48.521
Never trust me on math.

54:49.923 --> 54:50.564
Yeah.

54:50.584 --> 54:51.465
Of course.

54:51.805 --> 54:58.375
As my colleague Elaine says to me, she says, if we'd been good at math, we'd be doing other things.

54:58.395 --> 54:58.675
That's right.

54:59.110 --> 55:02.881
I always, I made mistakes in my book on simple math.

55:03.061 --> 55:05.388
God bless the copy of the machine.

55:06.391 --> 55:08.918
So anyway, so David,

55:09.472 --> 55:17.665
So anyway, I'm going to run out of my own time as well as your driving time.

55:18.686 --> 55:22.252
But was this primarily a gay lesbian collection?

55:22.312 --> 55:24.175
It was primarily a gay and lesbian collection.

55:24.215 --> 55:26.178
He had books of manuscripts?

55:26.378 --> 55:29.303
Principally of...

55:29.283 --> 55:33.329
of manuscript materials, of individuals' collections and organizations.

55:33.349 --> 55:34.490
Like writers and organizations?

55:34.550 --> 55:41.700
Yeah, yeah, people who had been political activists of various kinds, some early gay and lesbian task force stuff.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.522
Do you have any literature on this?

55:44.163 --> 55:50.532
Yeah, we have a sort of one-page henna, but in fact this is—

55:51.878 --> 55:55.102
This is the most recent newsletter for the collection.

55:56.424 --> 55:56.544
Great.

55:56.584 --> 55:57.966
It just came out this week.

55:58.066 --> 55:59.067
May I have it?

55:59.207 --> 56:00.209
Oh, please, please.

56:00.409 --> 56:01.350
Excellent.

56:01.610 --> 56:03.112
I can call this Brenda Marston.

56:03.212 --> 56:04.794
Yeah, she's right down the hall.

56:07.438 --> 56:08.159
So anyway.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.722
I think we can wrap it up, too.

56:11.803 --> 56:13.105
The tape is just about over.

56:13.145 --> 56:16.069
It seems to be a good place to start.

56:16.169 --> 56:17.110
I can call you, really.
