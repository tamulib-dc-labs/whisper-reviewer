WEBVTT

00:03.642 --> 00:07.448
Okay, we're rolling.

00:07.588 --> 00:19.007
What I was saying is that we're constantly asked now about learning strategies, how people are learning, and that people are able to access this information from all over the place and all the rest of it and everything.

00:19.027 --> 00:19.908
But it's just information.

00:20.469 --> 00:28.502
And the question is the process of assimilating and asking critical questions and thinking and discovering.

00:28.685 --> 00:34.337
And that, I mean, the students are going in and taking pieces of everything now.

00:34.357 --> 00:42.916
But the idea of being able to see what is complete, which is a scholarly work, and you can't really do that on the screen.

00:43.297 --> 00:45.802
All you're doing is searching for elements and pieces.

00:45.882 --> 00:46.744
So if you then...

00:47.197 --> 00:53.006
go beyond that, and you're going back to primary sources and all the rest of it to see, you know, what scholarship is.

00:53.026 --> 00:55.149
And that's what Minor Meyer has to do.

00:55.169 --> 00:57.352
He's interested in scholarship.

00:57.372 --> 01:05.364
That's why I'm convinced that the libraries that will be very significant in 15 years from now will be distinguished as special recognized.

01:05.384 --> 01:14.117
You know, it's the holdings that are somehow unique, that reflect the institution, that are characters, and they're not just reference.

01:14.137 --> 01:17.001
They're something that is specific to the scholarship

01:17.285 --> 01:23.839
of a time of an institution, reflecting its faculty, reflecting its presence, you know, and that's the distinction.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.084
And other libraries will say, well, that's fine.

01:26.124 --> 01:29.351
They have that, so we don't have to do that, so we can complement that.

01:29.411 --> 01:37.909
Libraries have become more individual.

01:39.745 --> 01:47.200
The big question to every academic institution now is, you know, everybody knows that technology has an impact.

01:47.220 --> 01:54.093
Learning styles are changing, that the library is playing a critical role in education, sort of re-centered on the campuses.

01:54.173 --> 02:00.606
More and more people will actually go to the library now than everybody talking about, you know, sort of the so-called port at every fellow,

02:00.805 --> 02:02.187
You know, you'd access them.

02:02.207 --> 02:04.209
It would be the demise of the library.

02:04.229 --> 02:06.012
It would be less than just the office.

02:06.032 --> 02:07.393
More people go to the library.

02:07.413 --> 02:08.535
Why do they go?

02:08.575 --> 02:11.979
They go because they need the assistance.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.401
The librarian is critical.

02:13.421 --> 02:16.505
They go because of a feeling of scholarship.

02:16.565 --> 02:20.110
They go to socialize, intellectually socialize, deal with people.

02:20.710 --> 02:23.674
We're all, you know, the library is a place.

02:23.654 --> 02:42.304
but what makes a place when you talk to all the different universities and everybody says with all the technology don't forget when i come in this building what i want to see the books and he says this everyone you talk to and he president basically is saying with almost any exception that they what we still want to say is that

02:42.284 --> 02:50.440
this feeling of history, of scholarship, that it's represented by the book, it's not represented by a disc.

02:51.041 --> 02:58.857
So how do you respond to, if I would say, for instance, there's a Washington Post University just opened a year ago.

02:59.297 --> 03:03.145
He was on record as saying that he would like a library

03:03.125 --> 03:06.929
no larger than a telephone booth.

03:07.069 --> 03:07.870
That's right.

03:07.890 --> 03:10.272
If he could have no books, he'd be happy.

03:10.553 --> 03:16.599
My feeling is that that is somebody's educational movement.

03:16.979 --> 03:22.025
And that may be fine for the students that he is trying to teach.

03:22.225 --> 03:29.993
I think I would say to him that that student is going to have a very, very narrow perspective to the world.

03:30.142 --> 03:32.506
in terms of being enlightened and contributing.

03:32.526 --> 03:39.378
I mean, you can channel someone's education and just force feed them, but what are they as a person?

03:39.418 --> 03:43.385
How do they transcend endovia beyond some particular skill?

03:43.405 --> 03:48.133
I mean, it has to do by serendipity, by discovery.

03:48.113 --> 03:52.998
go into a telephone booth and discover something and know that I always wanted to be an architect.

03:53.018 --> 03:59.664
So I'm going in and looking at architectural journals and all of a sudden I see someone studying the French Revolution and become fascinated by history.

03:59.684 --> 04:00.104
What doesn't happen?

04:00.184 --> 04:06.710
So, you know, the idea that information is a commodity, but knowledge isn't.

04:07.050 --> 04:12.616
And I think the idea that people are confusing access into information and creation of knowledge.

04:12.636 --> 04:14.257
It's precisely that.

04:14.277 --> 04:15.218
It is that precise.

04:15.316 --> 04:36.615
comparison that i used to start this chapter that i've been working at an institutional library and i called uh my kind of glory and he said you know he said you know there's a critical difference between information and knowledge is that the distillation of information is right right more than books

04:36.595 --> 04:43.174
It's wonderful, but it isn't totally calculable.

04:43.194 --> 04:44.057
That's what's wonderful.

04:44.097 --> 04:45.160
There's a mystique.

04:45.300 --> 04:45.982
There's a mystery.

04:46.003 --> 04:47.888
There's a sense of awe.

04:48.087 --> 04:53.035
inspirational, and that has to do with the place of the books and what you see.

04:53.136 --> 04:58.004
A library is processional in sequence as you go through when you discover.

04:58.024 --> 05:01.710
You go into a lot of libraries and bam, everything's right at you in the front door.

05:02.131 --> 05:03.273
Well, you know, it's too much.

05:03.373 --> 05:06.378
Have you seen the Fisher Rare Book Library at University of Toronto?

05:06.418 --> 05:06.578
No.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.480
That's my new sheet.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.121
It's my new sheet.

05:08.101 --> 05:13.971
It reminds me of the Beinecke, except with the Beinecke, everything is in the core.

05:14.212 --> 05:17.818
This is where everything goes around, but it's like an atrium.

05:18.099 --> 05:22.928
It's all real books that are magnificent.

05:23.168 --> 05:27.696
That's what's interesting with Minor Meyers.

05:27.895 --> 05:55.219
There's no question that his vision for that institution and his understanding their place in education, what is Illinois Western University, who is the faculty, who is the student, what is his aspiration, and he clearly feels that that institution needs a core of its collection, and that collection really to be valuable for the type of research and drawing the type of students has to be, it can't be all just electronic.

05:55.199 --> 05:57.021
It has to be something as tangible.

05:57.362 --> 06:00.466
And his feeling is, you know, what is that number?

06:00.486 --> 06:01.968
That number is double what it is now.

06:02.208 --> 06:03.369
How do you provide that?

06:03.389 --> 06:07.214
He's going to, very quickly, in 10 years, 15 years, whatever, get to the same as every institution.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.779
You get to zero growth in the sense of when you bring something in, you've got to take something out.

06:11.159 --> 06:14.704
Doesn't mean you get rid of it, but it may not be in that simple facility.

06:14.724 --> 06:16.907
It may be in remote storage.

06:17.027 --> 06:18.368
I would sense out to you.

06:18.388 --> 06:19.490
Self-world, exactly.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.331
It's the same thing.

06:20.351 --> 06:24.396
But every institution now is trying to figure out what is this core.

06:24.629 --> 06:26.271
How did I find it?

06:26.392 --> 06:27.193
What should it be?

06:27.553 --> 06:28.414
How big should it be?

06:28.515 --> 06:31.939
How does it represent our scholarship, our faculty?

06:32.801 --> 06:35.885
That's the number one question.

06:36.766 --> 06:39.731
That's the issue.

06:41.653 --> 06:49.084
Libraries now, there's no question, we are transitional in planning.

06:49.064 --> 07:18.143
we have the book which we say publishing rates are increasing paper information is still the best format for preservation there's no question about that Jay Lecker made a wonderful comment someone asked him in terms of preservation medium what the preservation life of electronic information is and he said in the book he said 100 to 300 years or whatever depending on the paper

07:18.308 --> 07:23.815
You know, what's an iconic interview that anywhere between five and fifty years?

07:23.835 --> 07:24.316
That's right.

07:24.336 --> 07:25.638
No one knows.

07:25.658 --> 07:28.321
And you've got to renew it every five years.

07:28.341 --> 07:34.089
Not only renew it, but not only renew the data, but renew the machine that accesses it and the software that drives it.

07:34.109 --> 07:35.671
Because if you don't say that, you can't get the data.

07:35.691 --> 07:44.603
But I think what you're talking about, what interests me is that the book still, it isn't, I mean, there's a difference between a book

07:45.123 --> 07:51.612
and someone who just gives you a facsimile of a number of pages that are placed together.

07:51.632 --> 07:53.896
The book is a complete thought.

07:54.016 --> 07:54.617
It's a work.

07:54.957 --> 07:57.721
It has a permanent binding.

07:57.781 --> 07:58.583
It's an idea.

07:59.264 --> 08:06.494
It's something that is, with everything that is so temporal and fleeting and moving, to me, the books are secure.

08:06.915 --> 08:07.996
I can read it backwards.

08:08.257 --> 08:08.998
An interesting antidote.

08:09.038 --> 08:10.540
I did work for...

08:10.638 --> 08:13.626
John Updike, the author.

08:13.646 --> 08:20.243
As every architect, he used to do all these projects on the side, and I was working in his house.

08:20.324 --> 08:40.763
and I was fascinated to see, as you as an author, he would go from room to room, I think they were working on his kitchen or something, and he's very much involved in the conversation, but then all of a sudden you realize that he would just sort of be tuning up, and he'd be tuning up because he went by some great array of books.

08:40.743 --> 08:43.406
And he would look at that, and he would watch him.

08:44.006 --> 08:49.131
He would lose the titles, and then, absolutely unconvinced, it was at random, he'd take a book off the shelf.

08:50.252 --> 08:56.438
He opened it, not with any idea where he was opening it, but he would be lost in those two pages he was reading.

08:56.458 --> 09:04.386
And he would read that, and he would be going on with the conversation, and he'd read that intensely, and you could see him looking at this, you know, and ask a question.

09:04.406 --> 09:09.130
He was totally gone, and all of a sudden, close the book up, put it back on the shelf,

09:09.464 --> 09:26.832
So he was rooted again and then he went on with the rest of the conversation.

09:27.335 --> 09:33.982
And I always think he's questioning very carefully about Shakespeare, about publication of his plays, or why he didn't develop it.

09:34.002 --> 09:35.824
It's exactly what you're describing right now.

09:35.864 --> 09:39.728
He knew I had some information that interested him.

09:39.748 --> 09:41.890
And never mind the interview that we were doing.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.093
He was picking my brains on this stuff.

09:44.113 --> 09:44.914
He's brilliant.

09:44.934 --> 09:49.078
Well, anyway, the book is something that's very special.

09:49.098 --> 09:52.802
And I don't see, even with MIT coming up with

09:52.782 --> 09:59.597
you know, the paperless book that you can sit on the screen and so-called flip pages on a screen.

09:59.617 --> 10:10.943
I mean, to me, I, and this is where I worry about future generations because I don't think that, I mean, that's fascinating to use the technology, but there's something that is equally valuable.

10:12.155 --> 10:27.210
about that book which i can turn upside down and move and feel and it's something that's very but i mean i constantly go back and pull out

10:27.477 --> 10:37.669
things from a shelf just to look at, to think about, or to see, or just have a feeling, you know, it's this big, it's just a lot of ways, what it feels like, what the design of it is.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.693
I mean, a book is a design work.

10:40.713 --> 10:42.255
You specialize in libraries.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.636
Yeah, all I do is libraries.

10:43.736 --> 10:45.598
How did that happen?

10:45.999 --> 10:52.827
When I joined, I've been with the firm about 25 years, and when I joined the firm, there was a fellow, a partner,

10:53.178 --> 11:03.018
by the name of a wonderful fellow, James Ford Clapp, who had written the book with Kies Metcalf, collaborated with him on the planning of undergraduate libraries originally.

11:03.038 --> 11:11.935
And this Jimmy Clapp sort of was continuing the tradition of libraries that started with A.J.

11:11.955 --> 11:12.857
Richardson in his term.

11:13.090 --> 11:19.899
And the firm has always done libraries, but Jimmy Kraft really got very much involved with academic libraries and developing that and into writing about it.

11:19.959 --> 11:23.223
And I came and was asked to apprentice with it.

11:23.243 --> 11:24.264
And I sort of had a choice.

11:24.424 --> 11:31.313
And as I remember back then, our practices kind of slipped between medical, the primary practice, between medical work and academic work.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.556
And Woodsy Academic worked 90% of his libraries.

11:33.576 --> 11:35.959
And I chose that.

11:36.479 --> 11:38.944
as opposed to medical.

11:39.065 --> 11:51.552
I was an English major at the Trinity College, and I was in English and Fine Arts, and so I've always loved, and my thesis was on the poetic

11:52.190 --> 11:54.355
The aesthetic vision of Gerard and Amy Huffman.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.660
How was that for some reason?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.384
When did you say that first?

11:58.665 --> 11:59.908
No, it was 64.

12:00.028 --> 12:02.955
I went to Bates up in Bates.

12:02.995 --> 12:03.656
Yeah, 65.

12:04.077 --> 12:07.365
Why don't you have a bite?

12:07.385 --> 12:08.848
Those are good.

12:10.263 --> 12:26.398
We learned from him and eventually take over the student leadership in sort of the academic library practice, and he retired about 15 years ago, I can't remember what.

12:26.378 --> 12:32.707
But there's been also a tremendous change and re-emphasis in library design.

12:32.727 --> 12:35.871
So it's been a very fortunate place to be.

12:36.372 --> 12:44.843
And I work with a wonderful group of institutions and smaller colleges and large universities.

12:44.823 --> 12:52.371
All of whom are, regardless whether they are a 400 person institution or 40,000, they're dealing with the same issue.

12:52.391 --> 12:57.857
The library is the same, whether it's got 5 million volumes or 500,000 or 50,000 volumes.

12:57.917 --> 13:05.585
It's providing a service, it's dealing with collections, it's dealing with teaching with an inquisitive mind.

13:05.645 --> 13:06.826
How do you put these elements together?

13:06.846 --> 13:11.011
Do you go to any particular libraries for inspiration?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.332
The one I love is

13:12.312 --> 13:19.781
To me, the first slide I ever show on projects is always the reading room of the Boston Athenaeum.

13:19.801 --> 13:21.583
And to me, we renovated that.

13:21.663 --> 13:31.916
To me, that just speaks of what a library is all about, to me, in the finest sense.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.942
And we're working down in Sterling now.

13:37.022 --> 13:41.047
And some great libraries and some very great people.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.268
I mean, I think that's the...

13:42.687 --> 13:53.941
It's really that the people that we're dedicated, you know, who are the sort of librarians today are a mass-sending group of people.

13:53.961 --> 13:58.647
They're interested in education.

13:58.667 --> 14:10.281
I mean, that's where it's rooted, but obviously they have a love of what the library represents as this secret knowledge, you know, and that's still very important.

14:10.301 --> 14:11.142
Do you have a sense?

14:11.122 --> 14:16.129
Do they have a sense of being under siege?

14:16.249 --> 14:26.464
Is the library, is the book under siege today about this paradigm shift business going on?

14:26.484 --> 14:33.214
I don't think, I think the librarians basically, my guess is that they do not need

14:33.397 --> 14:44.251
that the book is under siege, that they feel that they're having to deal with a lot of infidels and a lot of people who don't understand the fact that the book will be around.

14:44.271 --> 14:48.857
I think librarians basically feel with publication rates and all the rest of it is that the book is not going to disappear.

14:49.978 --> 14:58.609
And what proportion it is balanced within the library and how people are combining.

14:58.629 --> 15:00.231
I mean, the one thing that we're doing in libraries

15:00.532 --> 15:04.861
between computing and media and standard library together.

15:05.842 --> 15:13.157
You know, five years ago you had a library and you had a computing center and you had media independence.

15:13.177 --> 15:17.425
And just the technology is bringing them all into one place.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.890
And that one place is now serviced by

15:20.495 --> 15:27.550
people who are information specialists from a computing background.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.596
Dartmouth calls them computarians.

15:30.736 --> 15:34.504
We have librarians, and who are these people who are information specialists in terms of

15:34.670 --> 15:36.413
of the means of getting at that.

15:36.433 --> 15:39.257
And they are the people who are coming.

15:39.277 --> 15:44.425
But the fact is that from a student point of view, the student is format blind.

15:44.445 --> 15:48.371
They don't care today where that comes from.

15:48.391 --> 15:58.467
And they, whether it's a book, or whether it's media, or whether it's some reading-based information, and they want to be able to get it and combine it, and forward it, and use it in some way.

15:58.447 --> 16:07.440
The library has this very, very critical role of being current, but also being, you know, the representative of the history of the past.

16:07.640 --> 16:21.180
I don't think the library, I don't think the librarian feels, where the librarian gets very nervous is when, as in one case, someone stands up and they say, future of the library is on my credit card, or the library will only be a telephone booth.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.542
It's not that big.

16:22.562 --> 16:34.099
In the libraries they say, this is someone who's misformed, you know, and how do they counter with that?

16:34.119 --> 16:34.880
Let's have a fight.

16:34.900 --> 16:35.802
This is good.

16:35.822 --> 16:36.423
That's good.

16:36.443 --> 16:37.484
It's fun projects.

16:37.504 --> 16:40.048
I mean, there's nothing more exciting than a library.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.290
So you were an English major.

16:41.390 --> 16:41.791
Yep.

16:41.811 --> 16:42.291
That's interesting.

16:42.312 --> 16:43.914
So books matter to you.

16:45.036 --> 16:45.176
Mm-hmm.

16:45.196 --> 16:48.681
And where did you study?

16:48.701 --> 16:49.362
At Harvard?

16:50.337 --> 17:20.293
I had a, I finished 64, year 65, and I was in the war and all the rest of it, and I got a, I had a fellowship to teach for a year, a secondary school at Phillips Academy, Andover, and I was, I was engaged to teach English, and I got there, and they said, gee, there's a little problem, and we got this fellow who also is in English, who's really,

17:20.763 --> 17:23.788
Probably will stay in English and better prepared.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.152
We see your interest has always been in art.

17:27.034 --> 17:27.855
And you had a double major.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.900
Would you like to teach studio art?

17:31.020 --> 17:33.164
And so I was fantastic.

17:33.304 --> 17:36.189
So I went through studio art.

17:36.489 --> 17:40.476
And the fellow who was hired to teach English became a good friend just for a year appointment.

17:40.496 --> 17:44.543
He went on to get his doctorate in English literature, head of the...

17:45.417 --> 17:49.947
and now is head of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.

17:50.389 --> 17:52.493
A guy named Charles Pierce.

17:52.554 --> 17:52.995
Great guy.

17:53.395 --> 17:54.298
Wonderful guy.

17:54.318 --> 17:55.039
He is a great guy.

17:56.002 --> 17:57.305
And I love him.

17:57.405 --> 17:58.948
He's just a fantastic person.

17:58.968 --> 18:04.000
So he went that way and I went into, from there I went into landscape architecture.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.743
and then into architecture, so I did it.

18:06.763 --> 18:09.545
I went to Harvard in those programs.

18:09.565 --> 18:16.953
So really, you graduated college without a pale idea there should be an architect?

18:16.973 --> 18:17.113
Oh, no.

18:17.133 --> 18:17.293
No idea.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.875
Well, it's interesting that you've come to this.

18:18.895 --> 18:21.757
Yeah, liberal arts, which I believe in, which I believe fervently in.

18:21.858 --> 18:31.407
I'm going to have a chapter in this new book, and I'm trying to figure some ways to get into the debate over the literary canon without getting into the debate.

18:31.427 --> 18:32.468
You know what I'm saying?

18:32.887 --> 18:35.292
Because you can't win.

18:35.312 --> 18:36.575
So how do you do it?

18:36.655 --> 18:39.240
So I'm doing this chapter on St.

18:39.261 --> 18:41.345
John's College in Minneapolis, Maryland.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.109
Great books, right.

18:43.129 --> 18:43.469
Great books.

18:43.570 --> 18:46.295
I spent a couple days down there.

18:46.315 --> 18:46.997
How is that doing?

18:47.338 --> 18:49.081
I know that they have one out in New Mexico, too.

18:49.101 --> 18:50.845
Okay, the campus out in New Mexico.

18:52.124 --> 18:57.252
It's the same school.

18:58.113 --> 19:04.442
They just consider it the same school, two different campuses.

19:04.463 --> 19:08.829
And, you know, it's like they've got a full employment, they say, and they've got a wonderful rating.

19:08.849 --> 19:10.311
I mean, they're a five-star school.

19:10.331 --> 19:10.632
Oh, yeah?

19:10.652 --> 19:11.313
It's not just reading.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.416
You know, I mean, they do math.

19:13.436 --> 19:13.997
They take mathematics.

19:14.017 --> 19:14.377
They take science.

19:14.397 --> 19:16.140
They have to demonstrate efficiency in ancient reading, ancient reading.

19:16.120 --> 19:21.310
There are no written tests, no written examinations.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.091
Really?

19:22.112 --> 19:24.356
It's all classroom participation.

19:24.376 --> 19:24.556
Wow.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.243
No grades.

19:28.263 --> 19:30.367
It's really something.

19:30.989 --> 19:34.736
And it's liberal arts taking to the extreme, I guess.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.918
Now, where do those graduates go?

19:36.674 --> 19:38.996
Where do those students go on?

19:39.076 --> 19:40.458
How do you typify that?

19:40.618 --> 19:44.221
I was talking to one young woman who's going to medical school.

19:44.241 --> 19:48.886
And I said, can you do that without any... You know, we have the sciences here.

19:48.906 --> 19:49.727
I mean, like yourself.

19:49.747 --> 19:55.532
You came into architecture as a generalist, with a world view.

19:55.552 --> 19:57.034
I would look at the position.

19:57.054 --> 20:03.340
Yeah, see, people come in, they say, well, if I really want to be an architect, and I say, well...

20:03.320 --> 20:04.247
That's great.

20:04.710 --> 20:07.390
The best way to do it is to go through the warts.

20:07.555 --> 20:11.379
You can pick anything you want, and then specialize afterwards.

20:11.439 --> 20:22.250
But obviously, a great majority of other people still are those who, at the age of 18, decide they'll be an architect, and then they go to a good school and get a five-year program of architecture.

20:22.270 --> 20:22.670
That's right.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.352
Well, we think alike.

20:24.652 --> 20:35.503
How long have you been working on this book?

20:35.483 --> 20:37.987
Four years.

20:38.007 --> 20:42.294
Is that what the gestation period did they do research about this period?

20:42.314 --> 20:45.540
This draws a lot on that.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.042
I'm a general writer.

20:47.483 --> 20:55.235
There's no reason why I felt I had to go write about books in the library.

20:55.296 --> 21:00.083
I felt like I hadn't done the whole thing.

21:00.103 --> 21:02.267
It's like a physician who graduates medical school,

21:02.247 --> 21:06.415
Just does one surgery and then puts.

21:06.856 --> 21:10.803
I spent so much time learning this field.

21:10.823 --> 21:13.288
It just seemed to me that there was more I could do.

21:13.328 --> 21:14.750
What a time in the field.

21:14.831 --> 21:18.337
Everyone is speculating as to what the future is.

21:18.357 --> 21:18.898
Nobody knows.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.140
That's the whole thing.

21:20.161 --> 21:20.922
I'm getting into everything.

21:20.942 --> 21:21.924
Preservation.

21:21.944 --> 21:25.310
I went to Leipzig in Germany where they're leading the world in the preservation of paper.

21:25.350 --> 21:25.791
Really?

21:25.771 --> 21:44.995
i went up to cornell where they're leading the world in the digitization that we did that library up there the cross library oh then you did that one yeah special questions yeah you did that yeah i love that yeah we did the law library that was an interesting now you had problems with a lot of ground water out there oh yeah yeah but you can handle that

21:44.975 --> 21:51.688
But I mean, really, underground with all that water coming down off the coast.

21:51.708 --> 21:53.592
You've got all these books.

21:53.832 --> 21:55.796
See, I know them.

21:55.816 --> 21:56.578
That's right.

21:56.658 --> 21:58.922
But Cornell is a very interesting situation.

21:58.942 --> 22:04.173
They have determined, the trustees have told them, that they will not have, that's it.

22:04.193 --> 22:06.477
Now, they've got 6.8 million books.

22:06.592 --> 22:11.062
But they said five million is all we're ever going to allow now in Central Campus.

22:11.182 --> 22:13.126
Central Campus, right.

22:13.327 --> 22:15.271
Central Campus.

22:15.351 --> 22:15.532
Right.

22:15.552 --> 22:21.164
So what happens when somebody presents you with that figure, let's say?

22:22.126 --> 22:24.031
Now you have to take that into account.

22:24.071 --> 22:24.893
This is it.

22:24.913 --> 22:26.035
Five million books.

22:26.015 --> 22:31.221
The access is going out to the Apple Watch, and we'll decide what books go there.

22:31.282 --> 22:33.945
But now you have a number to work with in your mind here?

22:34.045 --> 22:35.026
Yeah.

22:35.046 --> 22:35.947
What happened?

22:35.967 --> 22:53.249
Well, what's interesting is that you look at any collection today, and you see that of that five million volumes, I don't know what Cornell is at, but traditionally a collection, 30%, 40% of that are background-bound journals.

22:53.489 --> 22:54.891
And you begin to think of

22:55.293 --> 22:56.755
the different types of questions.

22:56.775 --> 23:00.101
How much is in government documents and how people actually, do they browse it?

23:00.121 --> 23:00.782
How do they get at it?

23:02.084 --> 23:02.826
How are they using it?

23:02.906 --> 23:04.108
How can it be brought to them?

23:04.168 --> 23:07.433
The big issue today is document delivery.

23:07.453 --> 23:13.924
If somebody can search and find something, can I bring that to me?

23:13.964 --> 23:17.250
Can I bring not only that book, what's adjacent on that shelf?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.854
Can I bring what's on the five shelves around it?

23:20.355 --> 23:21.537
Can I look visually

23:21.517 --> 23:23.180
And you can do that now.

23:23.240 --> 23:31.072
You can do it electronically so that when I browse and I get a citation and I see, oh, yes, there it is.

23:31.853 --> 23:33.396
It's whatever work it is.

23:34.257 --> 23:47.298
I now can, I think there is the ability electronically to be able to look up and see for the so-called cyber shelf and find what is adjacent in that collection.

23:47.318 --> 23:49.161
Now, what falls on that shelf?

23:49.411 --> 24:13.748
and that's the beauty of browsing the whole point of going into collection is to discovery you know how much you look for one thing but discover something else and you cruise and you look i mean it's like upside going yeah well they're going to try to do that electronically well they won't do it but where it comes into play is remote access i mean if i've got five million volumes and that's constantly being the most used the most

24:13.728 --> 24:26.027
most relevant to the research of that faculty at a time, and then their back issues, backgrounds, or things that they're taking out are, you know, the JSTOR project at Mellon, things like that, and social sciences.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.690
Do you work with that, the JSTOR?

24:27.750 --> 24:30.214
Well, most of the institutions subscribe to that.

24:30.314 --> 24:32.057
I mean, that's an interesting concept.

24:32.037 --> 24:32.979
Absolutely.

24:33.119 --> 24:36.366
I was down in, I'll let you meet for a second.

24:36.386 --> 24:43.161
I was down in Vanderbilt, so it's a good talk down there, and I met the librarian Paul German that day.

24:43.181 --> 24:46.508
He is Jake's court, and he also buys a lot of serials.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.971
He's very interesting.

24:48.532 --> 24:49.354
Last year,

24:49.638 --> 24:56.810
They did a study of how many hits they had on journals for which they also had the hard copy.

24:57.010 --> 24:59.915
And how many hits they had where they had electronic and hard copy?

24:59.935 --> 25:03.080
Yeah, so Joe's store you can go in and get the electronic.

25:03.100 --> 25:03.501
Right, right.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.925
Made everything in the background.

25:05.905 --> 25:11.070
They've been buying these journals, the hard copy journals as well.

25:11.090 --> 25:12.751
So they wanted to see where there was overlap.

25:12.771 --> 25:13.712
Where did they find it?

25:13.913 --> 25:18.197
Where students, they had 2,300 kits, the items for which they also had the hard copy.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.519
And I said, well, that's good.

25:20.579 --> 25:24.222
We're going to make a decision there, actually.

25:24.342 --> 25:26.745
I said, we're going to cancel some subscriptions.

25:26.765 --> 25:27.585
They said, yeah, yeah.

25:27.605 --> 25:29.567
I'll be canceling some subscriptions.

25:29.707 --> 25:29.868
Yeah.

25:29.888 --> 25:32.430
If they're doing it electronically, then they're not using the hard copy.

25:32.570 --> 25:32.750
Yeah.

25:32.770 --> 25:35.693
I think that in the future, I don't think there's much doubt about it.

25:35.673 --> 25:42.055
Well, it ain't going to survive.

25:42.235 --> 25:44.282
Maybe that's good.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.466
Because we're not talking about the degree of law.

25:47.486 --> 25:48.887
I don't know so much.

25:48.907 --> 26:02.699
When you think of UCLA, I think UCLA has 95,000 titles, and the largest, I think it's the largest, second largest, and the largest in many universities.

26:02.839 --> 26:09.725
It's an interesting figure, and you get it from UCLA, and the university, and that covers all of their libraries.

26:09.745 --> 26:13.088
What does that mean in terms of dollars and titles?

26:14.232 --> 26:39.177
Yeah, I think we did a plan out there, and I just can't remember a number of years ago, but I was just astounded, but it was in the 90s, and I think it was a very large research university, very esoteric and all the rest of it, but how do you manage the total of how much of that, and how much of that is just, you know, the dollars invested, how much can be electronic?

26:39.157 --> 26:47.390
a lot of that journal material is not going to be found in a traditional way.

26:47.410 --> 26:57.065
I think that computer or databases, it does really allow you to enable you to find things that you would never find otherwise.

26:57.085 --> 26:57.566
This is happening to me.

26:57.586 --> 26:58.127
For this book,

26:58.107 --> 27:01.311
And I mean, my last book was published three years ago.

27:01.331 --> 27:07.659
I'm finding things that I can't even believe I never would have found.

27:07.719 --> 27:11.383
That's what we've seen at college, universities, everywhere.

27:11.564 --> 27:18.512
What they're all saying is the students are now coming to the library much better prepared.

27:18.796 --> 27:25.024
They've done a lot of initial searching, preliminary work.

27:25.084 --> 27:25.745
They're doing a lot.

27:25.985 --> 27:26.766
Perfect example.

27:26.826 --> 27:28.348
From here, I'm going up to the FNA.

27:28.368 --> 27:30.691
At this time, I'm going over to White House.

27:30.711 --> 27:32.193
I've already searched the databases.

27:32.213 --> 27:33.354
You might know what you want.

27:33.414 --> 27:35.036
I have a whole list of books that I have.

27:35.056 --> 27:36.638
And I know they're sheltering pages.

27:36.658 --> 27:38.981
And I know whether or not they've been checked out or not.

27:39.001 --> 27:41.164
Because I can even check, I can determine circulation.

27:41.184 --> 27:43.487
Well, see, the mistakes that a lot of the...

27:43.838 --> 27:50.748
college and universities were making a number of years ago were saying, well, because students get access remotely, they won't go to the library.

27:51.569 --> 27:56.897
On the contrary, more going to the library, asking more complex questions, and it's twofold.

27:57.078 --> 28:00.683
One, because they need the help of the library.

28:00.663 --> 28:03.288
to provide the interface.

28:03.389 --> 28:09.261
And because there's no question, the other thing that we did a study out of the library at USC a few years ago.

28:09.281 --> 28:09.661
Pardon?

28:09.721 --> 28:12.367
You did the term with the study?

28:12.387 --> 28:14.892
Yeah, well, we did work with USC about

28:15.378 --> 28:19.444
how students were learning, trying to define what the new library was.

28:19.544 --> 28:21.487
Is this a published study?

28:21.507 --> 28:21.968
No, we did it.

28:21.988 --> 28:22.929
We developed a program.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.933
We did it with Peter Lyman.

28:25.073 --> 28:26.435
I interviewed Peter for this book.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.156
Pardon?

28:27.256 --> 28:28.418
I interviewed Peter for this book.

28:28.438 --> 28:32.805
Well, see, the concept out there was in Berkeley now.

28:32.825 --> 28:34.107
No, he used to be at USC.

28:34.187 --> 28:40.356
He was at USC, and this was the first library we did, which was a sort of new concept of the teaching library.

28:40.336 --> 28:44.686
And the center of that teaching library is Computing Commons.

28:44.786 --> 28:50.940
It's the concept of the gateway by which a library... Computing Commons.

28:50.960 --> 28:57.214
And the idea is that it's an area in the building which is all designed around...

28:57.380 --> 29:08.093
the collaborative use of technology to access information in a highly serviced environment that is serviced both by computing and by libraries.

29:08.113 --> 29:11.317
So you have reference library staff and you have computing library.

29:11.497 --> 29:16.843
Both the people are together in the same environment, assisting the researcher in this sort of gateway.

29:17.444 --> 29:20.788
The idea is coming in, being able to use technology,

29:20.768 --> 29:25.901
to begin to discover, to find, to combine media, to really advance themselves.

29:25.921 --> 29:33.459
And the idea is from there, they will go to any of the other 13 libraries in USC or to go anywhere in the world and essentially access information.

29:33.479 --> 29:36.286
So Peter's idea, this is sort of the gateway concept.

29:36.306 --> 29:38.592
And that really is true.

29:38.808 --> 29:54.015
But the big part of all of that was that we found in the programming effort out there is that students, this whole collaborative nature of advancing knowledge, students work together.

29:54.248 --> 29:58.854
obviously many, many more group study spaces, small seminar spaces.

29:59.254 --> 30:16.116
So we're designing carrels, which are designed, a technology carrel, a lot of them are designed for two people to sit together to use the same single piece of technology with a third person able to stand up and join them.

30:16.376 --> 30:17.978
We found that as soon as you do that,

30:17.958 --> 30:40.388
the space for four people you have two independent thoughts and conversations and it breaks down three people you can control the acoustics and you can control the effort so we designed these cows which one person may use but more largely the other usc there are two people there and this is the whole idea they're there they're accessing they're discussing they're talking they're helping one another they're learning so this whole

30:41.397 --> 30:52.967
Collaborative learning style is absolutely the way people are learning today.

30:52.987 --> 30:59.453
Well, I thought you had a war at the university that's largely, and they have what's known as a protected budget, so they buy books.

30:59.553 --> 31:04.437
I mean, a lot of places think they're growing more money into technology, and so where do they cut them from?

31:04.457 --> 31:05.738
They kind of didn't look at it.

31:05.758 --> 31:10.122
Well, up there, they have a protected budget for books, mandated by law, because they are kind of a face-to-face national library.

31:10.102 --> 31:19.179
The piece of a week now, in 1997, recirculated 7 million items.

31:19.339 --> 31:21.764
That's $60,000, $10 million.

31:21.784 --> 31:24.829
But they also have all the stuff, too.

31:24.849 --> 31:32.143
The piece of a week that's exactly what you're saying right now is that

31:32.478 --> 32:00.898
the more technology they use the more print they use i mean we're finding that one the more technology the more print the more print they also use as you said my vision for the future is maybe we're getting more technology as opposed to more books i think we're going to wind up getting more of everything right that's what's happening everybody looks back when we went into microforms right microforms was really going to decrease acquisition rates

32:00.878 --> 32:03.601
It did nothing.

32:03.941 --> 32:06.824
It's just a supplement to it.

32:07.264 --> 32:09.387
Well, that's right.

32:09.407 --> 32:11.749
But also, you know the ARL, the ARL statistics.

32:11.769 --> 32:22.740
They do show, however, that the average volume of students that has gone down over the last 10 years.

32:22.760 --> 32:23.521
That's a fact.

32:23.541 --> 32:24.822
They are requiring a few of books when they did 10 years.

32:24.842 --> 32:25.102
Oh, yeah.

32:25.122 --> 32:28.205
And, you know, are they getting rid of books, too?

32:28.225 --> 32:30.127
Yeah, I mean, no, they are.

32:30.147 --> 32:30.868
I mean, I think it's...

32:31.068 --> 32:44.440
I was shocked to hear him say, not shocked, but I agree.

32:44.460 --> 32:56.291
He said he believes in benign attack as a form of preservation.

32:56.311 --> 32:58.813
In other words, letting books that are worthless.

32:58.928 --> 33:00.372
Let them go?

33:00.492 --> 33:01.214
Yeah, let them go.

33:01.535 --> 33:02.838
That's what they do in Cornell.

33:03.179 --> 33:08.313
They have a policy which they call Bayes' deterioration.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.198
And that's Ann Kenney.

33:10.379 --> 33:15.452
Which is, basically, we made a decision on this particular book,

33:15.432 --> 33:22.420
We're not going to enact any invasive procedures to save it.

33:22.560 --> 33:32.471
We're going to make it comfortable and let it die a natural death.

33:32.511 --> 33:42.722
When it dies a natural death, it goes to the dump, and when a scholar comes in and finds a citation for that, I bet you Cornell can get that in some other place.

33:43.158 --> 33:44.259
Maybe, maybe not.

33:44.279 --> 33:50.185
But if Cornell would have determined that's a single copy... Well, you see, what's the last copy for them?

33:50.205 --> 33:59.755
What we are finding is that some places aren't getting rid of things without ascertaining whether or not that's a last copy.

33:59.775 --> 33:59.895
Right.

34:00.155 --> 34:02.958
Well, you can determine it very easily.

34:03.699 --> 34:04.960
You'll see I'll see that of this.

34:05.441 --> 34:06.242
Right.

34:06.262 --> 34:07.663
You know, it's just the last copy.

34:08.150 --> 34:12.114
So these are all very interesting issues.

34:12.134 --> 34:19.921
And that's why I think libraries will be distinguished as more as special and unique collections.

34:19.941 --> 34:32.293
Not only did everything, it won't be that everything in that collection per volume is unique, it's the fact that someone collected certain, that there is a certain attitude to collection, focus, and a specialty.

34:32.313 --> 34:34.275
And I think we'll see that

34:34.762 --> 34:37.887
I mean, that's what draws faculty to institutions.

34:38.047 --> 34:43.096
And also the depth and the strength of the collection.

34:43.116 --> 34:44.598
The number is still better.

34:44.858 --> 34:46.161
Why does the ARL publish these figures every year?

34:46.181 --> 34:52.611
Why is it that Harvard is absolutely insisting that he's maintaining not only dramatics, but overwhelming dramatics?

34:52.631 --> 34:54.594
Because they're the best.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.297
But Rudenstein has come out and said,

34:56.581 --> 34:58.988
We can't have everything.

34:59.068 --> 35:06.770
He has said that we will have to recognize the fact that other institutions will have holdings that we cannot have.

35:06.790 --> 35:08.434
Yeah, but that's always been the case.

35:08.454 --> 35:11.523
You've heard of the Farmington Plan that has developed back in the 50s.

35:11.543 --> 35:11.603
No.

35:11.583 --> 35:16.151
They basically carved up the world.

35:16.191 --> 35:17.233
Yeah.

35:17.253 --> 35:18.735
That's right.

35:18.795 --> 35:22.402
He did with the Camille Rouge and all that stuff.

35:22.422 --> 35:23.363
Yeah.

35:23.504 --> 35:25.186
Oh, was that the Farmington Plan?

35:25.287 --> 35:27.591
It was the Farmington Plan.

35:27.611 --> 35:28.572
I researched that.

35:28.813 --> 35:31.177
I haven't had that in the book.

35:31.457 --> 35:31.658
Yeah.

35:31.678 --> 35:34.182
I'm going to have a chapter also on that.

35:34.162 --> 35:37.108
They're going to be fascinating.

35:37.168 --> 35:48.289
Immigre libraries, for instance, under the discussion of Sarajevo, and how an international team is trying to get materials outside of the country to try and somehow replicate what they want.

35:48.349 --> 35:49.892
They're not going to be able to do it.

35:49.872 --> 35:55.743
In the case of Cambodia, they had everything at Cornell.

35:56.444 --> 36:00.171
Everything was destroyed, and they reseated it.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.335
Better probably than it was when it was destroyed.

36:02.355 --> 36:09.147
Last year, Harvard returned to the Republic of Georgia, the archives of that country, which has been here for 60 years.

36:09.167 --> 36:09.688
And now they return it.

36:09.708 --> 36:10.469
Well, because they left.

36:10.489 --> 36:12.994
And the deal was, we're going to keep these archives until it's an independent Georgia.

36:12.974 --> 36:15.758
So finally they went back.

36:15.778 --> 36:23.571
That's actually quite interesting to say that the role of a company's libraries is to... It goes on and on and on.

36:23.591 --> 36:26.095
They're trying to establish their history.

36:26.115 --> 36:27.838
When there was no Poland.

36:27.858 --> 36:28.679
Poland was broken up.

36:28.699 --> 36:30.782
The National Library of Poland moved past.

36:30.802 --> 36:32.565
It's the people who don't check Poland eyes.

36:32.585 --> 36:33.266
It's still here.

36:33.507 --> 36:35.450
You're still on the way.

36:35.470 --> 36:37.573
So Chopin went here and... I'm all set.

36:37.593 --> 36:39.336
I'm going to check this.

36:39.603 --> 36:44.371
I love this whole idea of emigrating and knowledge traveling.

36:44.391 --> 36:48.157
Cardinal Bessarian goes to Venice, my wife and I will Venice see much.

36:48.177 --> 36:51.703
And then also going to libraries and history, you see.

36:51.723 --> 36:56.430
You know, maybe I can talk to you when I'm doing this.

36:56.671 --> 36:58.153
Oh, yeah.

36:58.173 --> 37:03.041
To me, are you familiar with a book called The Care of Books?

37:03.061 --> 37:03.161
Yeah.

37:03.181 --> 37:04.303
It's a famous, famous book.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.946
I'll give you a citation.

37:06.006 --> 37:06.066
Oh.

37:06.046 --> 37:10.752
And it's more than the care of books where he goes and he studies all the fittings and all these libraries.

37:10.772 --> 37:11.152
Oh, really?

37:11.212 --> 37:12.354
I'd like to know that.

37:12.454 --> 37:15.477
Oh, and it's a really, very difficult book.

37:15.758 --> 37:16.899
I've got a copy of it.

37:16.919 --> 37:18.080
I'll give you a citation on it.

37:18.201 --> 37:20.884
I'd like, if you could send me that and the piece you did.

37:20.904 --> 37:23.287
You have to see this book, and you can see it after the afternoon.

37:23.307 --> 37:23.567
Oh, I will.

37:23.587 --> 37:24.288
I'll go look at it.

37:24.308 --> 37:25.810
If you give me what I did.

37:25.830 --> 37:30.215
But he goes, he measures fittings, how they do bookcases, how they tallow.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.977
Oh, I'd like to see that.

37:31.997 --> 37:32.998
Chain Library.

37:33.018 --> 37:33.599
Chain Library.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.361
There's another book which came after this.

37:35.341 --> 37:41.152
which I also have, it's called the Chain Libraries of England, and he expresses his debt to this earlier.

37:41.172 --> 37:46.122
You see, when you decide that you're going to have the Chain Library, you also determine those skulls are going to be there.

37:46.162 --> 37:50.129
Now you determine where the window's going to be, because they also don't have any natural light.

37:50.189 --> 37:53.215
So are we going to stand, or are we going to sit down?

37:53.195 --> 37:58.743
What do you know about this library in Alexandria?

37:58.943 --> 38:01.367
What they're doing now?

38:01.387 --> 38:02.789
I don't know.

38:02.869 --> 38:10.621
I've heard different pieces, but I don't know nothing specifically about it at all.

38:10.701 --> 38:11.402
Pardon?

38:11.562 --> 38:13.244
Right, right, right.

38:13.264 --> 38:14.907
Yeah, I don't know.

38:14.987 --> 38:20.535
Some people describe it as a blue logo.

38:20.515 --> 38:21.356
Who knows?

38:21.777 --> 38:23.939
I don't know anything about what the collections you know.

38:24.220 --> 38:29.626
So what happens if you sit down with librarians and administrators and you get a sense of the vision of the university?

38:29.646 --> 38:30.688
Yeah, that's the key.

38:31.188 --> 38:31.909
That's everything.

38:31.949 --> 38:35.674
I mean, the thing is that, you know, what is Illinois Wesleyan doing?

38:36.435 --> 38:38.337
They have a library, all right, fine.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.959
Okay, but where is that institution going?

38:40.259 --> 38:44.405
You know, and it's president, and it's trustees, and what's its culture?

38:44.985 --> 38:46.187
You know, where is its place?

38:46.207 --> 38:48.029
You know, how does the library support that?

38:48.089 --> 38:49.611
How does the library advance that?

38:50.047 --> 39:01.538
What can we do when we have the same tools, you know, dealing with collections and technology and staff and reading space, you know, but what, you know, the library is, thanks a lot.

39:01.959 --> 39:02.419
I got it.

39:02.439 --> 39:03.440
I got it.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.022
Spencer, that's what I remember.

39:05.042 --> 39:09.266
No, no, no, no, no problem.

39:09.446 --> 39:15.092
The, you know, the library, the more and more everyone understands the need to have an intellectual senate.

39:15.427 --> 39:22.673
And the interesting thing is that an intellectual center is no longer, it's not passive, it's active.

39:22.693 --> 39:23.734
Something happens there.

39:25.796 --> 39:30.259
You know, you're seeing and you're doing and you're advancing yourself.

39:30.279 --> 39:36.184
And so the idea is, you know, why does someone come to a college or university?

39:36.204 --> 39:42.530
What is the, you know, now I can get my degree remotely, you know, and I can do it at wide distance learning.

39:42.590 --> 39:43.791
Yeah, wide distance learning.

39:43.811 --> 39:45.332
What's the value added?

39:45.498 --> 39:55.255
Part of that value added is what happens when people get together and begin to explore and discuss and be stimulated by

39:55.488 --> 39:57.492
and be refocused and shape their values.

39:57.592 --> 39:59.796
It's called education.

39:59.816 --> 40:00.537
It's called education.

40:00.618 --> 40:02.822
We tell our children, you know, gee, what should I say?

40:02.942 --> 40:04.906
I don't care.

40:04.926 --> 40:06.408
Just be there.

40:06.428 --> 40:08.853
Once you get excited about it, get impassioned by something.

40:09.454 --> 40:10.997
Get into something, you know.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.842
So the library plays a very real role.

40:13.922 --> 40:16.467
I mean, it is an intellectual community center.

40:16.447 --> 40:21.415
It's there, everything, and the library kind of gets pushed off to the side there for a few years.

40:21.535 --> 40:23.899
Well, they're not in common libraries anymore.

40:23.919 --> 40:24.179
That's right.

40:24.199 --> 40:25.061
Learning resources.

40:25.081 --> 40:26.263
What happens when you see that?

40:26.323 --> 40:28.246
That's the University of Michigan, for instance.

40:28.266 --> 40:31.230
Yeah, yeah, they're whatever it's called.

40:31.291 --> 40:32.112
I haven't seen it.

40:32.212 --> 40:35.117
I'm going out actually a week after next to go see that.

40:35.137 --> 40:39.484
But, I mean, I think it's just one aspect of how information is sustainable.

40:39.984 --> 40:42.268
But there's still something...

40:42.248 --> 40:47.875
There's something that is unique and centering about the place of a library.

40:48.656 --> 40:55.504
Students tell me 60% of a library's usage is not using library materials.

40:55.905 --> 41:00.851
Everybody says, well, we now have study rooms in every dormitory.

41:01.452 --> 41:02.653
We have computing access.

41:02.836 --> 41:07.665
and then you go to talk to these institutions, you're right.

41:08.126 --> 41:09.368
You mentioned Rice and Princeton.

41:09.448 --> 41:11.131
Yeah, Rice and Princeton both of them.

41:11.231 --> 41:12.013
Where do they study?

41:13.014 --> 41:19.446
You know, if you really talk to the students, you know, and where a little scholarship takes place, it's not in their rooms.

41:19.947 --> 41:21.890
They access information.

41:21.991 --> 41:23.393
They can prepare themselves.

41:23.744 --> 41:25.867
to go to that place of scholarship.

41:25.927 --> 41:27.428
And where is the place of scholarship?

41:27.989 --> 41:28.770
It is the library.

41:29.211 --> 41:32.735
The library is the laboratory of the classroom?

41:32.755 --> 41:33.676
Yes, it is.

41:33.736 --> 41:34.637
Peter Lyman's thesis.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.981
The library is an extension of the classroom.

41:38.001 --> 41:41.666
In the business environment, we talk about the breakout space.

41:43.087 --> 41:46.051
Where does the classroom get extended?

41:46.291 --> 41:48.935
You go and just take notes and memorize something?

41:48.975 --> 41:50.176
Well, that doesn't do anything.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.017
Where do you go?

41:51.368 --> 41:53.150
take that idea and discuss it.

41:53.170 --> 41:56.394
Further, well, the library.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.839
So we have now places in the library for meetings, for discussions.

41:59.859 --> 42:13.216
You know, wonderfully at Princeton, the vast majority of the teaching at the graduate level takes place in the library, briefly, with the collections and to expose that level of scholarship.

42:13.236 --> 42:14.237
So it's a very

42:14.690 --> 42:15.951
It's a very special place.

42:15.971 --> 42:18.955
It's going to be a very, very sad day, I think.

42:18.975 --> 42:26.703
You know, it's when colleges have libraries assigned to a phone booth, then education is just a commodity.

42:26.863 --> 42:33.250
You know, you're just forcing someone through, you get so many grades, you get them out and give them an expert in.

42:33.290 --> 42:36.434
That's a little bit hard to do with Helen Benley.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.957
And the graduates over at the Bowman Library.

42:38.977 --> 42:40.258
They take out a huge manuscript.

42:40.238 --> 42:42.360
I mean, I get a piece of pimples.

42:42.500 --> 42:42.821
Absolutely.

42:42.841 --> 42:43.762
I do when you talk about it.

42:43.782 --> 42:44.783
I mean, it's all exactly.

42:44.803 --> 42:46.224
And I said, you think of that.

42:46.305 --> 42:49.428
He said, because they have to know where it comes from.

42:49.448 --> 42:50.950
That's right.

42:50.970 --> 42:53.072
You know, there's a history of an idea.

42:53.212 --> 43:02.943
Yeah, and then at Cornell, they go into special collections, and they bring out all the, you know, extraordinary precious books.

43:02.963 --> 43:07.107
And they work as students, undergraduate students we talked about, as graduate students.

43:07.087 --> 43:08.648
How do you handle these things?

43:08.708 --> 43:09.849
Pick up the first full wheel.

43:10.330 --> 43:13.232
There's a guy at Princeton.

43:13.252 --> 43:15.714
We're doing some work down there, and I'll have to get it for you.

43:17.436 --> 43:19.578
We're doing some consulting on the libraries down there.

43:19.698 --> 43:22.901
Are you working on the coaching library?

43:22.921 --> 43:23.161
Pardon?

43:23.181 --> 43:24.422
The Lloyd's coaching library?

43:24.482 --> 43:26.424
No, that's within Firestone.

43:26.444 --> 43:27.344
That's all done.

43:27.384 --> 43:28.545
We're having a chapter on coaching.

43:28.626 --> 43:28.986
Oh, are you?

43:29.386 --> 43:30.267
That's a great story.

43:30.287 --> 43:31.008
I'll tell you.

43:31.288 --> 43:31.888
Oh, I like that.

43:32.229 --> 43:36.132
But we were introduced to a faculty member down there who teaches

43:36.955 --> 43:53.378
i think he's in history and we were introduced to him because he is a real uh believer and user of the library and he teaches a course on books and reading well i have his bibliography i have his course i got it

43:53.611 --> 43:55.575
And so I have it in the office.

43:56.036 --> 43:58.682
If I can put my hands on it, I'll fax it to you.

43:58.762 --> 44:02.029
But I took it out to Rice with me, to the librarian at Rice.

44:02.089 --> 44:04.133
I said, annotate this for me.

44:04.153 --> 44:05.516
I said, I'm fascinated by it.

44:05.536 --> 44:08.683
It's mostly in the 16th, 17th century, the history of the book.

44:09.153 --> 44:13.860
But they teach a course on it.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.002
What's his name?

44:15.022 --> 44:16.124
I'll get it for you.

44:16.144 --> 44:16.645
Remind me.

44:16.765 --> 44:20.110
Princeton University is the guy who teaches the course on the history of the book.

44:21.712 --> 44:25.578
And so I went to the Special Collections Library, and I was talking about it, and I said, gee, I've met him.

44:25.638 --> 44:26.299
It was fascinating.

44:26.319 --> 44:28.663
And they said, oh, I teach him that.

44:28.863 --> 44:32.810
I participate in that, and one of my papers or books is part of the reading list.

44:32.930 --> 44:34.714
And so I said, where do I get the reading list?

44:35.074 --> 44:37.138
And I said, that's just wonderful.

44:37.258 --> 44:38.180
So I got the reading list.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.522
Is it a big reading list?

44:39.583 --> 44:40.685
No, it's four pages.

44:40.785 --> 44:41.867
I'd love to have it.

44:41.907 --> 44:42.087
Yeah.

44:42.167 --> 44:42.608
No, it's fun.

44:42.668 --> 44:43.850
I might even find some stuff there.

44:43.870 --> 44:44.732
Oh, yeah, some of the stuff.

44:44.792 --> 44:46.956
And you'll see when I fax it to you,

44:46.936 --> 44:51.482
you'll see that there's an annotation in it that says, Jeff, this is a classic.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.203
You ought to look at this.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.084
You ought to read that.

44:53.104 --> 44:59.913
That's the librarian who's a wonderful guy at Rice who comes from Columbia University.

44:59.933 --> 45:01.756
You mentioned that I should come.

45:01.776 --> 45:05.721
Yeah, he's coming here, and if there's a chance to get together,

45:05.937 --> 45:08.503
I think he's a very... Are they building the library?

45:08.703 --> 45:09.846
We're expanding the library.

45:10.067 --> 45:17.303
He is a historian, PhD in history, as well as a librarian.

45:18.366 --> 45:20.290
Chuck Henry, Charles Henry.

45:20.310 --> 45:21.533
And he's a...

45:21.513 --> 45:28.523
You know, this is where I'm out of my league because I'm, you know, I'm an architect designing libraries, but I listen to all these people.

45:29.124 --> 45:33.470
He's just a very... Do you do very well for libraries?

45:33.551 --> 45:34.292
Oh, yeah.

45:34.312 --> 45:35.033
Oh, yeah.

45:35.053 --> 45:35.574
Any place.

45:36.214 --> 45:41.682
I mean, I've been through, you know, through Europe and... Have you been to the Calendulas?

45:41.722 --> 45:43.205
Oh, yeah.

45:43.305 --> 45:44.707
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

45:44.727 --> 45:47.571
And then in Europe and...

45:47.551 --> 45:50.555
I don't like any questions, books, great libraries.

45:50.995 --> 45:51.876
Great libraries.

45:51.896 --> 45:54.059
Great libraries.

45:54.079 --> 45:55.801
I'll send you a citation.

45:55.881 --> 45:57.864
I think there's fax a couple of title pages to you.

45:57.884 --> 45:58.244
Yeah.

45:58.264 --> 45:58.505
Yeah.

45:58.685 --> 46:00.066
No, I mean, I'll give you this.

46:00.127 --> 46:01.448
Yeah, I'll give it to you right now.

46:01.508 --> 46:03.471
I'll fax the title pages of some of these books.

46:03.751 --> 46:05.814
Yeah.

46:06.915 --> 46:16.647
If you could do that with us, I mean, my great joy is getting, the greatest thing that ever happened to me is I had a fellowship after graduate school.

46:16.863 --> 46:19.489
And I was over in Europe for a year.

46:19.750 --> 46:23.419
And the fellowship was not enough money to live on, you know.

46:23.459 --> 46:24.161
And you had all year.

46:24.261 --> 46:27.790
My proposal was to study indigenous architecture in Finland and Norway.

46:27.810 --> 46:29.414
And so I was going to spend the winter there.

46:30.056 --> 46:31.058
But I've been in Scotland.

46:31.747 --> 46:58.260
and my wife, and we met a Don from Oxford, and she asked what we were doing, and she said, well, you know, we're going to try to get over to Norway, and we're going to kind of huddle down there, and it's going to tell you this, and she said, well, and I said, we're going to read, and so we asked her, I said, if you were in, and we literally were in a little cabin, you know, an island, and it's necessarily south of Oslo, I said, if you had to spend an entire winter there, what would you read?

46:58.730 --> 47:01.634
And so she gave us this reading list, which is wonderful.

47:01.914 --> 47:04.398
And so it was fantastic.

47:04.438 --> 47:07.302
You know, all the works of C.P.

47:07.322 --> 47:08.604
Snow and a variety of things.

47:08.624 --> 47:09.445
And I can't even remember.

47:09.485 --> 47:11.087
I mean, this is 25, 30 years ago.

47:11.127 --> 47:16.755
But it was, I mean, that is the greatest thing for someone to say, well, gee, if I had four months

47:17.866 --> 47:21.610
Here are the things, not that I haven't read, but here are the things I would like to reread.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.232
Here are the things that someone should read.

47:23.893 --> 47:25.295
That's fascinating.

47:25.375 --> 47:27.037
I asked Harold Boone this question.

47:27.157 --> 47:28.899
I said, well, what would you take?

47:28.999 --> 47:30.701
And he said, well, get anything.

47:30.721 --> 47:32.142
He said, the Bible.

47:32.503 --> 47:32.883
Take the Bible.

47:32.923 --> 47:35.006
The Bible one, speak spiritually.

47:35.026 --> 47:35.967
He said, no, it's difficult.

47:36.047 --> 47:37.809
But he went through a list for me.

47:37.829 --> 47:38.370
Desert Island books.

47:38.390 --> 47:39.491
Yeah, so this is the same thing.

47:39.551 --> 47:40.953
It's the same thing.

47:40.973 --> 47:41.393
Yeah, yeah.

47:41.373 --> 47:43.396
you know, what the books you would expect.

47:43.416 --> 47:46.881
But the one that he said you'd have to have is the King James Bible.

47:46.921 --> 47:48.864
That's interesting.

47:48.884 --> 47:49.785
That is true.

47:49.805 --> 47:52.369
Well, I think that's, to me, the idea.

47:52.449 --> 47:54.311
I'm going to tell Echo.

47:54.331 --> 47:55.974
I had to do that.

47:56.054 --> 47:56.795
That's right.

47:56.815 --> 47:58.077
I had to do that.

47:58.097 --> 48:00.961
Even though Echo will be in this new book, too, isn't it?

48:00.981 --> 48:01.722
Maurice Sendak.

48:01.742 --> 48:03.424
The thing I like, who?

48:03.444 --> 48:04.005
Who?

48:03.985 --> 48:12.559
I can't wait to read it.

48:15.504 --> 48:19.530
I read a wonderful quote by Barton Gregorian.

48:21.046 --> 48:26.913
And when he said, and I don't have it, I have it, I have it written down someplace, and he said there's no university.

48:28.095 --> 48:29.777
I haven't written it before.

48:29.837 --> 48:30.298
No university?

48:30.318 --> 48:31.960
No, no university is greater than a library.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.183
And there can be no great university without a great library.

48:34.203 --> 48:35.905
I quote it right in the second paragraph.

48:35.925 --> 48:36.686
Good, good.

48:36.746 --> 48:37.767
It's solid live time.

48:37.948 --> 48:38.929
Okay, well, there it is.

48:38.989 --> 48:40.711
That to me, I quote him.

48:40.891 --> 48:42.193
That to me is so important.

48:42.292 --> 48:46.196
And if you begin to think of it, it's actually true.

48:46.376 --> 48:48.359
But now let's define what a great library is.

48:48.419 --> 48:50.641
And it varies by the institution.

48:50.661 --> 48:51.983
It's not formulaic.

48:52.083 --> 48:53.244
It's not numbers.

48:53.705 --> 48:54.706
Pardon?

48:54.786 --> 48:55.907
It's not numbers anymore.

48:56.107 --> 49:05.658
I talk to people and say, the ACRL and all the rest of it still rate the libraries by their number of seats and their holdings and all the rest of it.

49:05.678 --> 49:10.543
But it's more the issue we're trying to get people to meet.

49:11.266 --> 49:23.903
It's how information is used, and how often it's used, and what is the information you can make available in whatever format is more significant than necessarily what you're physically holding in a university.

49:24.324 --> 49:37.662
So Cal Poly, one of the new science library out there, engineering library at Cal Poly just done, and they were very proud of the number of kits they have.

49:37.928 --> 49:43.716
And that was as important as certainly coming in and being able to access information.

49:43.736 --> 49:45.858
So the library is a whole different point.

49:45.878 --> 49:47.541
Are some of your projects in here?

49:47.561 --> 49:49.203
Sorry, should I ask you about some of your projects?

49:49.223 --> 49:50.765
No, they're all in there, yeah.

49:50.785 --> 49:51.446
Any favorites?

49:51.466 --> 49:52.267
Any ones?

49:52.287 --> 49:54.430
They're all like the children.

49:54.530 --> 50:01.759
No, I think the interesting thing, the one that's not in there that is really interesting is that we're doing the Library of the Dartmouth right now, and that's fascinating.

50:01.819 --> 50:03.261
There's a real progression.

50:03.241 --> 50:32.607
in the libraries that we started with Peter Lyman at USC then we just finished the library down in Emory and you're beginning to see this merging of libraries and computing and media coming together in different ways and then we did it a little bit different way at North Carolina Charlotte but we're really taking that another step forward at Dartmouth now in a major way major integration of bringing we're taking the culture of

50:32.873 --> 50:35.817
computing, which is very, very significant in Dartmouth.

50:35.837 --> 50:41.125
Dartmouth was one of the premieres in computing, in academic computing on a campus.

50:41.345 --> 50:49.177
Whereas at Emory and USC, we're taking all of it and bringing it into the library.

50:49.197 --> 50:51.000
And we're integrating it into the library.

50:51.020 --> 50:52.722
That's the whole concept of

50:52.702 --> 51:17.595
of essentially an academic environment of one-stop shopping that the student the faculty member they don't care you know the idea and this is an interesting characteristic of students today if a student comes in and and and looks up a citation and and then what that format is how do they get at that how do they transfer that information if they simply if they go to the in the library they say well we can't answer that you really got a problem with your software

51:18.031 --> 51:41.963
be able to get it out of transfer you now have to go over to this building students don't do it so go back now so what so what happened was that that emory usc was just an idea and a piece coming in to see what would happen and when we brought computing in we brought it in a service environment and we brought and computing itself stayed out of the building in terms of the professionals but some of the staff came in

51:41.943 --> 51:45.408
And we set this up, and we did a little experiment in the Bahini Library.

51:45.428 --> 51:48.252
We had a reference desk and a computing desk.

51:48.272 --> 51:48.873
Students don't care.

51:48.893 --> 51:57.146
They would go to the computing people and ask them content questions, and they would go to the reference desk and ask them how questions, rooting questions.

51:57.166 --> 52:02.854
And so you put it together, and then we went to Emory, and there were Jim Johnson and Joan Galgals.

52:03.273 --> 52:07.323
with Billy Fry, who's a, you know Billy Fry?

52:07.664 --> 52:18.852
Billy Fry is one of the, he's the provost there, and he's one of the great, when you talk about people around this country, of one of the, F-R-Y-E, Fry, and one of the great,

52:19.186 --> 52:25.418
supporters and believers and exponents of the meaning of the library, that name comes up, Billy Pry.

52:25.999 --> 52:35.798
What we did is that we went down and they have the Canada Library, which is just like the old one, done by the same architect at Cornell.

52:36.299 --> 52:37.060
Then they had

52:37.242 --> 52:53.580
the old library which is the undergraduate library on the campus the research library on the graduate library and they said gee we really got to bring in computing and media in some way so let's bring it in on the old library and expand that and leave the research library and when we looked at it we said no that's that's not right what we need to do

52:53.560 --> 53:01.552
is build between these two buildings, build a whole new center that becomes the entrance, goes to the research library and the graduate library, and becomes the gateway.

53:01.912 --> 53:02.874
Same concept.

53:02.894 --> 53:11.046
How do we bring people in now, bring in computing, and provide a service environment that has media, computing, and reference all together?

53:11.279 --> 53:23.137
It works because I was down there and a fellow in media, and it's very, very sophisticated what they do, and he came up and he said, well, he said that he had a good testimony to why this works this morning.

53:23.157 --> 53:34.755
He said, we had an undergraduate student out there, and she had been working for two days and had all this information, all these different formats, and she went up to do the research in the academic power, came back, she lost it.

53:35.056 --> 53:35.697
Okay.

53:36.178 --> 53:39.282
Well, computing people couldn't solve it by themselves.

53:39.342 --> 53:41.806
Reference couldn't solve it by themselves.

53:42.206 --> 53:44.009
And media, because the whole man couldn't.

53:44.069 --> 53:47.715
But all three of us were there, and we solved it.

53:47.795 --> 53:49.337
So all the disciplines are there.

53:49.357 --> 53:50.939
They're all working in a collaborative basis.

53:50.959 --> 53:52.001
We'll see in the years.

53:52.101 --> 53:56.187
And we've planned Emory so that even though the culture of computing

53:56.420 --> 53:59.565
of those people that came in is distinct, and they have their own space.

54:00.867 --> 54:05.293
And this was interesting to us, because we came in, we said, oh, they'll all be together, and they'll all be intermingled.

54:05.313 --> 54:07.857
Well, as soon as you bring them together, everybody wants to define their own territory.

54:07.877 --> 54:13.045
You've still got a very old culture in the library and a new culture in computing, and nobody wants to lose their identity.

54:13.626 --> 54:15.188
But the fact is that over time,

54:15.387 --> 54:20.413
you're going to see, depending on where library schools are going, you're going to see much of this really merging.

54:20.673 --> 54:22.995
Exactly.

54:23.476 --> 54:33.867
But what happened is then we get to, so we did that, so we saw more of an integration at Emory, and then at Dartmouth, we're seeing the total integration.

54:33.887 --> 54:39.133
Dartmouth is taking a very sophisticated, which is computing, which is not only just

54:39.788 --> 54:49.821
is taking the software development, the servicing, the reproduction, the selling of computers, the repair kit, everything is coming right into the libraries.

54:49.841 --> 54:50.843
One stop shopping.

54:50.863 --> 54:51.864
It's very random.

54:52.265 --> 54:57.191
They're saying they don't care whether a student comes in, they come in with a laptop, they don't know.

54:57.411 --> 55:02.438
The student doesn't know that they've got a content issue, a software issue, a hardware issue.

55:02.671 --> 55:08.919
But they want to bring them into a place which is an intellectual center, and they can facilitate that.

55:08.940 --> 55:10.808
So what do you say to the old Luddites?

55:11.193 --> 55:13.776
It's going to work out.

55:14.256 --> 55:15.798
Are you optimistic?

55:15.818 --> 55:16.839
Oh, absolutely.

55:16.859 --> 55:17.780
Oh, absolutely.

55:17.800 --> 55:21.023
I've never been more optimistic in the future of the library.

55:21.043 --> 55:24.286
Mainly because the library is moving forward.

55:24.306 --> 55:28.671
The library is rather than fighting technology and saying, well, we're only going to take that segment of it.

55:28.971 --> 55:32.194
They're saying that they're embracing it and saying that we know.

55:32.475 --> 55:35.918
The faculty member at Harvard were doing the library at the Harvard Medical School.

55:35.898 --> 55:40.225
And we were trying to figure out who the users were and why people were going to use the library.

55:40.546 --> 55:41.067
Same old question.

55:41.087 --> 55:42.249
Are they going to come in the library now?

55:42.269 --> 55:46.576
And we had a wonderful senior faculty member, senior researcher, way up there.

55:47.578 --> 55:54.309
Typical wife came in and sat in a meeting, and we said, how do people use the library?

55:54.329 --> 55:55.331
What is your use of library?

55:55.351 --> 55:57.354
And he said, I don't go in the library.

55:59.538 --> 56:00.319
And we spoke.

56:00.569 --> 56:04.697
But I use the library more than I ever know.

56:04.717 --> 56:06.500
So he said, what?

56:06.621 --> 56:07.803
He said, all of my research.

56:08.745 --> 56:12.372
He said, I now can do it two hours, what it used to take me to do in two weeks.

56:13.233 --> 56:16.620
So he said, I send all my postdocs over.

56:16.752 --> 56:19.616
And now all these postdoctoral students.

56:19.916 --> 56:20.637
Those are the people.

56:20.677 --> 56:23.701
They go in with very specific demands and citations.

56:23.761 --> 56:27.345
And so we have what we call search and seize.

56:27.365 --> 56:30.149
It's a mentality of people coming in.

56:30.329 --> 56:39.921
Particularly when you talk about a medical environment, the time issue is so critical of the time of that information.

56:39.941 --> 56:40.962
It's currency.

56:41.042 --> 56:44.987
And these students are coming in because the faculty member now in his research

56:44.967 --> 56:50.361
is seeing all of these different things iconically and said, find the article on that.

56:50.501 --> 56:51.644
Compare it to the article on that.

56:51.664 --> 57:01.288
So they go in, and it's the library now that is able to take these post-docs and get all this information in all these different formats, help them assimilate and get it, take it.

57:01.657 --> 57:03.739
or transfer it directly to the lab or whatever.

57:03.759 --> 57:05.461
I mean, it's this whole document delivering.

57:05.801 --> 57:06.883
It's fascinating.

57:06.903 --> 57:11.828
What we haven't discussed, and I don't know if you're going to discuss it regularly.

57:11.848 --> 57:13.810
We haven't discussed this at all, the appearance of the library.

57:13.830 --> 57:17.013
Tell me about the artistic statement.

57:17.053 --> 57:27.865
The library, I mean, I think when we go back and say that there is a whole lot of sense of place, and the permanence of the library is still very important.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.668
I mean, years ago, somebody said,

57:30.968 --> 57:37.469
was the president of the college, and we asked, talked about, well, what is it when you go in the library?

57:37.489 --> 57:38.833
And he said, all things being equal.

57:38.914 --> 57:40.178
He said, I want it.

57:40.198 --> 57:41.502
There must be a sense of awe.

57:41.870 --> 57:43.573
some sense of inspiration.

57:44.154 --> 57:53.030
It can't just be coming in and Barnes, they weren't Barnes and Nobles at the time, but the idea, it just can't be easy access.

57:53.050 --> 58:02.747
There has to be something that is transcending to something more, that I'm in the face of something that is bigger than I am, that's inspirational, that is a

58:02.727 --> 58:06.812
that is a gateway, that it is an opportunity for me.

58:06.832 --> 58:11.318
There's got to be something that is invigorating, not diminishing.

58:11.478 --> 58:19.849
To me, there's a very fine balance of finding your place in the universe, coming in and saying, well, this represents knowledge.

58:19.869 --> 58:27.739
Think of the efforts and what is compiled and is here, but it is something that you're trying to design a scale that somebody

58:27.888 --> 58:29.190
It feels comfortable in that.

58:29.210 --> 58:45.795
They're inspired by it, but they say, this is something that I can be a part of, and I can use, and it's comfortable, and I can develop within it.

58:45.775 --> 58:48.721
It's not one hook, it's a half a million.

58:48.921 --> 58:49.482
That's right.

58:49.943 --> 58:51.386
So how do you do that?

58:51.827 --> 58:57.158
I don't care if it's an undergraduate library, it's the same thing with minor liars.

58:57.258 --> 59:02.248
But as you work and you work your way up within this building, the top of this building is a very, very special leading room.

59:02.228 --> 59:09.821
I think you want to be able to see what the library is.

59:09.841 --> 59:12.065
The library is not just service and technology.

59:12.485 --> 59:14.108
It's service and technology and collections.

59:14.208 --> 59:16.212
It's a combination of things.

59:18.876 --> 59:24.085
That means that when you enter the library, my point is that from a planning point of view, you want to get

59:24.436 --> 59:28.781
to the center of the library horizontally and vertically as quickly as possible.

59:28.921 --> 59:31.784
Therefore, to enter the corner and find you is very difficult.

59:31.804 --> 59:33.245
So how do you get to that center?

59:33.265 --> 59:33.806
It's very hard.

59:33.846 --> 59:38.551
And then when I'm approaching that center, how can I see more than just on one floor?

59:38.591 --> 59:41.654
So therefore, we say, how do we make visual connections?

59:41.674 --> 59:45.879
I don't have to have all great amount of collection on the first floor, but can I see it above?

59:46.620 --> 59:47.500
How do I get to that?

59:47.681 --> 59:49.202
What pulls me up within the building?

59:49.262 --> 59:53.667
I know this is a level of activity, and then it's going to get quieter and quieter as I go up.

59:53.832 --> 59:55.615
more rarefied, more speculified.

59:55.635 --> 59:58.420
You know, if they've been in the New South, it's still publicized.

59:58.440 --> 59:58.921
I've seen.

59:59.022 --> 01:00:00.184
I haven't been in it yet.

01:00:00.224 --> 01:00:01.987
Any comments on what you've heard about it?

01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:03.329
Well, you hear all bits and pieces.

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:06.856
I mean, I've seen the plans and seen the bodies, but you have to experience this space.

01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:07.237
I can't.

01:00:07.257 --> 01:00:07.978
I'd love to see that.

01:00:07.998 --> 01:00:11.164
As I said, the acoustics are wonderful.

01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:11.284
Nice.

01:00:11.264 --> 01:00:13.327
And acoustics are wonderful.

01:00:13.347 --> 01:00:14.429
You can hear a pinch of them.

01:00:14.529 --> 01:00:16.372
Oh, is that right?

01:00:16.552 --> 01:00:17.313
Oh, I mean, yes.

01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:18.295
Oh, I see that.

01:00:18.335 --> 01:00:19.957
Well, that's the thing, indeed.

01:00:19.977 --> 01:00:22.822
If you don't hear books, I was discouraging it.

01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:24.044
They couldn't fit them.

01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:26.988
I mean, to me, that must be a problem.

01:00:27.048 --> 01:00:35.922
Yeah, because it's not fair, but to me, there was a mismatch between what, I mean, if you read it in a, whether this weekend in your time.
