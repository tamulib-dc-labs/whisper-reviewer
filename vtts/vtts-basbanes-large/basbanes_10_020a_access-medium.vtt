WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:05.631
Taking notes and... Good.

00:05.651 --> 00:06.252
All right.

00:06.312 --> 00:09.518
So we're talking to Andras and Jeff.

00:09.539 --> 00:10.480
So we'll just put this here.

00:11.142 --> 00:15.070
I thought you might find this interesting, given that you're interested in libraries.

00:15.911 --> 00:15.991
Oh.

00:16.071 --> 00:22.063
This is about the pillage and dispersion of the Charles Library around the third century.

00:22.324 --> 00:23.406
This is very interesting.

00:24.753 --> 00:25.774
This is very interesting.

00:25.814 --> 00:30.340
That's interesting, because that was a really freebooting time in Iran.

00:30.680 --> 00:43.295
Zili Sultan, one of the royal princes, dismantled a large part of the Visbahan and sold off the saleable to antiquities dealers and the like.

00:44.396 --> 00:50.423
Well, one thing I haven't, and why that is of particular interest to me, maybe gentlemen have some ideas.

00:51.162 --> 00:54.725
One thing I'm trying to develop is also emigre libraries.

00:54.826 --> 00:57.969
How do people continue to document their existence?

00:58.529 --> 01:01.152
Which is why the connection to the old culture, that kind of thing.

01:01.172 --> 01:04.095
Yeah, really, which is why this Romanov exhibition is in a public library.

01:04.115 --> 01:16.346
Well, only 3,000 items were sold from the, you know, when the Soviets took over and sold the, and then Wartan Gregorian told me about the Polish library in Paris, when there was no Poland.

01:16.667 --> 01:16.967
Yeah.

01:17.656 --> 01:20.179
Yes, there was a government in London and a library in Paris.

01:20.199 --> 01:30.312
There's actually vast literature on the Post-Russian Revolution, Russian emigre press.

01:30.993 --> 01:33.456
I can get you a couple of those.

01:33.476 --> 01:42.307
There's a wonderful article appeared in a fairly obscure source, Journal of Oriental Librarianship or something.

01:43.229 --> 01:46.633
That's my kind of thing.

01:47.272 --> 01:56.224
an off-print of it, I think, on the Russian press in China in the 20s through the 1940s.

01:56.264 --> 01:57.645
The Russian press in China?

01:57.806 --> 01:57.946
Yeah.

01:57.966 --> 01:59.267
And what would it be doing there?

01:59.288 --> 01:59.888
What was the problem?

01:59.908 --> 02:03.893
There were hundreds of thousands of white Russian emigres.

02:03.913 --> 02:05.155
Who made their way through.

02:05.536 --> 02:07.618
So they went to China, and they brought the documents.

02:07.638 --> 02:12.064
I had a friend in school at the University of Chicago who was born in China,

02:12.365 --> 02:14.848
brought up in Australia and came to the U.S.

02:15.089 --> 02:16.390
to do graduate work.

02:16.471 --> 02:20.115
So what happened in 1949, or whatever it was, when the Fabianists took off?

02:20.176 --> 02:22.739
Well, a lot of them moved on, like this fellow who's paid.

02:22.759 --> 02:23.680
They allowed it out.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.021
No, no, no.

02:24.041 --> 02:26.985
A lot of people fled in panic from Shanghai and other places.

02:27.005 --> 02:33.253
I mean, they had a very adventurous time because, you know, there was the Japanese occupation as well.

02:33.313 --> 02:34.455
So where did the materials go?

02:36.137 --> 02:36.678
The materials?

02:36.698 --> 02:42.085
Well, first of all, a lot of them were, like much of the immigration intellectuals.

02:42.638 --> 02:45.623
And so they set up little libraries.

02:45.783 --> 02:49.569
They were incredibly prolific publicists.

02:49.809 --> 02:55.598
And so, you know, you had everybody running his own little literary journal, of which he wrote 90%.

02:55.618 --> 02:58.923
I love it, though.

02:58.943 --> 03:00.165
This is very important stuff.

03:00.185 --> 03:05.053
You had, you know, political movements, religious movements.

03:05.554 --> 03:11.042
You had everything from, you know, various sort of anti-Semitism Marxists.

03:11.866 --> 03:24.913
to deeply religious folk who loathed the atheist regime back home, to even a group that called themselves the Russian Nazi Party,

03:25.231 --> 03:33.002
to set out on the Chinese side of the Manchurian border, a great illuminated swastika to blink across into Solomon, Siberia.

03:35.305 --> 03:47.802
There's a wonderful book on the Russian Nazis who, towards the end of their existence, I think three-quarters of the membership were paid KGB agents reporting on each other.

03:47.842 --> 03:53.550
Well, the reason I'm going to Venice, one of the reasons is that...

03:54.138 --> 03:55.240
the Armenian life.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.142
Well, that's what I was going to say.

03:57.262 --> 04:10.300
As a matter of fact, clearly when immigration is associated with trauma, there seems to be a really profound desire to retain cultural links and so on.

04:10.661 --> 04:14.526
And the Armenian example right here at home in Watertown.

04:15.888 --> 04:19.993
The ALMA, the Armenian Library and Museum of America.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.235
Here in Watertown?

04:21.255 --> 04:23.318
Yeah, right next door.

04:23.770 --> 04:27.334
It's a rather, it's an interesting institution.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.835
Alma, right?

04:28.855 --> 04:29.816
Alma, A-L-A-M.

04:29.956 --> 04:33.840
I can give you the whole museum of a manner, right?

04:33.860 --> 04:37.544
Well, they'll probably tell me everything I need to know before I go to this.

04:37.564 --> 04:39.766
Well, they are, you know, Venice is a different thing.

04:39.886 --> 04:43.530
I mean, Venice goes back to the 18th century.

04:43.550 --> 04:49.356
I understand, but I mean, they'll certainly have knowledge and public documents that will help me.

04:49.859 --> 04:52.123
Can you think of any other examples?

04:52.383 --> 05:03.903
There's a book that was just published by Random House, a $100 book by this woman who has spent the last six years trying to find all the documents that she can of the Kurds, who have 20 million people, but they have no national archive.

05:04.184 --> 05:12.878
So what do they do to preserve their... Well, I don't know if they have any... I mean, they obviously have a modern political literature, isn't there?

05:12.898 --> 05:15.563
I'm sure there's literature that goes way back.

05:15.712 --> 05:18.657
Yeah, but they don't have a formal archive to preserve that stuff.

05:18.677 --> 05:24.126
Yeah, I mean, you had this for all the immigration from the former Soviet Union.

05:24.687 --> 05:30.958
You had the immigration from Nazi-occupied Europe, which did much the same thing.

05:31.839 --> 05:40.774
And in a more modest sense, you had it in the New World, where, for example, modern Czechoslovak

05:41.362 --> 06:08.061
and modern vernacular Arab literature were essentially new world emigrate creations, where Czechoslovakia was founded by Masaryk, who organized in America, and in the case of modern Arab vernacular literature, the vast Arab emigrate community in South America produced the first major literary journals

06:08.952 --> 06:23.670
And, you know, there are Arab libraries in Brazil and... Another person who you would probably talk to... ...a conference of the Middle East Librarians Association that dealt with this is called Mahjar Literature, M-A-H-J-A-R.

06:23.770 --> 06:25.252
Mahjar just means emigration.

06:26.053 --> 06:33.762
Another person locally who would be useful for you to talk to, he's not a Kurd, but he's an authority on Iraq, is Khanan Makiya.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.314
How would you spell that?

06:36.334 --> 06:39.861
M-A-K-I-A, first name K-E-N-A-N.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.045
Oh, I can call him up on Hollis.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.109
Don't you have his card in there?

06:44.390 --> 06:48.798
Oh, I may, but I was thinking I could also print out his publication.

06:49.219 --> 06:50.682
M-A-K-I-Y-A.

06:50.762 --> 06:51.664
M-A-K-I-Y-A?

06:51.704 --> 06:54.670
M-A-K-I-Y-A.

06:54.970 --> 06:59.576
Anyway, he is very interested in the fate of the Kurds.

06:59.817 --> 07:00.417
He's in exile.

07:00.438 --> 07:06.486
He's written a book on the genocidal activities of the Iraqi regime against the Kurds.

07:07.267 --> 07:10.672
The person you talked about, Kurds, was it a lady?

07:10.952 --> 07:11.312
A woman.

07:11.673 --> 07:13.215
I can't think of her name.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.859
It's a big, big book.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.202
It's Random House.

07:20.802 --> 07:22.024
I've got it at home.

07:24.427 --> 07:27.030
I'll fax you something on it.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.214
It's a very important book, but what she did is she went out.

07:30.595 --> 07:34.780
She's a MacArthur Fellow, so she had money, which is very important.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.684
Well, she's actually using it for something quite productive.

07:38.187 --> 07:52.107
And she's a photographer or journalist, but she was there, and she's actually just tried to go out and find these people and their documents, their photographs, and she's gathered what she found in this book, which is, I think, a very, very important, you know, book.

07:52.127 --> 07:53.569
Certainly something I can mention.

07:53.589 --> 07:59.037
There's a woman in New York I know who is very active on British documents.

07:59.057 --> 08:04.785
This could easily be she, but when I get back, I'll happily email her thanks to her.

08:05.457 --> 08:07.700
But, you know, there's similar things.

08:07.740 --> 08:17.671
You heard, perhaps, about the recent repatriation of the Georgian State Archives from Harvard to Georgia?

08:17.812 --> 08:19.093
No, no, no.

08:19.293 --> 08:22.277
You go to the Harvard Press Office, they'll get you the news releases on it.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.961
Basically— What were they doing at Harvard, though?

08:25.981 --> 08:27.102
Okay, I'll tell you.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.868
Georgia, in the Middle Ages, was an independent kingdom.

08:31.888 --> 08:33.490
In the 18th century,

08:33.892 --> 08:37.315
late 18th, early 19th century, it was absorbed by Russia.

08:39.037 --> 08:49.707
And then after the Russian Revolution, when the Russian Empire broke up, Georgia was one of these many states that enjoyed a very brief independence.

08:50.588 --> 09:00.017
And so there was a Republic of Georgia, and it was recognized by the League of Nations, and it existed for maybe two, three years before the Bolsheviks overran it.

09:01.718 --> 09:06.202
And the fleeing Georgian government took its archives with it.

09:06.623 --> 09:08.285
This is so important.

09:08.545 --> 09:13.710
And the archives survived in the hands of Georgian emigrates in Paris.

09:14.931 --> 09:19.516
And these guys were getting old, and they were worried about the safety of the archives.

09:20.056 --> 09:26.983
So they made a deal with Harvard's Houghton Library to deposit these archives with Houghton with the understanding that when

09:27.250 --> 09:30.755
Georgia became free again, that these would be repatriated.

09:30.976 --> 09:33.059
Well, how come there wasn't a news story on this?

09:33.219 --> 09:34.361
There was.

09:34.381 --> 09:34.561
Was it?

09:34.601 --> 09:35.262
When did this happen?

09:35.282 --> 09:36.964
The Gazette, I think.

09:37.105 --> 09:38.487
This happened like this summer.

09:39.829 --> 09:39.969
It did.

09:40.129 --> 09:41.711
Maybe I was away or something.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.095
Did it make any kind of a splash at all?

09:44.277 --> 09:50.643
That's a spectacular story.

09:50.663 --> 09:52.544
You can see how I get my kick.

09:52.604 --> 09:53.445
You started this.

09:53.966 --> 09:56.148
This all fits into this.

09:56.248 --> 09:57.088
It does.

09:58.169 --> 10:02.033
Because of you, I've gone up to Cornell where they're doing the Cambodia project.

10:02.813 --> 10:05.176
When the Khmer Rouge came in, they destroyed everything.

10:05.236 --> 10:10.200
Lo and behold, however, Cornell has the great Southeast Asian collection.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.462
It's almost a depository thing.

10:12.577 --> 10:22.829
This is where digital stuff, Jeff, is outstanding, because what they're doing is reseeding the Cambodian National Collections digitally with material that's on file.

10:22.849 --> 10:25.993
Did you manage to access the OCLC article?

10:26.193 --> 10:26.514
Not yet.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.376
Oh, yes, I did.

10:28.396 --> 10:28.897
Of course I did.

10:28.917 --> 10:29.878
The Bosnian one.

10:29.898 --> 10:30.298
I'm sorry.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.239
I copied it up.

10:31.319 --> 10:32.100
I did it immediately.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.223
I thought you were talking about something.

10:34.243 --> 10:34.784
No, no, no.

10:34.864 --> 10:35.284
I'm sorry.

10:35.304 --> 10:35.725
Yes, I did.

10:35.745 --> 10:36.426
Absolutely.

10:36.446 --> 10:38.228
I thought you were talking about Cambodia here.

10:38.248 --> 10:41.031
Anyway, since I talked to you last,

10:41.332 --> 10:51.742
series of phone calls and correspondences with my friend in Toronto, I told you we had this breakthrough, and it was really fabulous.

10:51.762 --> 11:09.718
The retired professor who had the materials, Eliazar Birnbaum, it's E-L-E-A-Z-A-R Birnbaum, B-I-R-M-B-A-U-M.

11:10.306 --> 11:32.213
Anyway, he's a retired professor at University of Toronto, and he'd been to Sarajevo in the early 1980s, and he's one of these old-fashioned philologists and scholars of manuscripts, and also, you'd be not surprised, an avid collector of rare books and manuscripts himself.

11:34.035 --> 11:38.220
Anyway, he went to Sarajevo about

11:39.179 --> 11:47.088
17, 18 years ago, in the early 1980s, and did some research at the manuscript libraries there.

11:47.128 --> 12:09.034
He actually published a couple of articles on the manuscript collections there, and he requested photocopies of some manuscripts that interested him for various reasons, including their being related to some manuscripts that he had, you know, by topic or author or whatever.

12:09.368 --> 12:16.035
He got these, and in the long run, he never did anything with the copies, although he's still working on articles.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.017
So how much material did he get, do you think?

12:19.578 --> 12:26.606
All together, it's 350 pages of xeroxes of original manuscripts that are now ashes.

12:27.286 --> 12:28.668
Wow.

12:28.688 --> 12:34.954
And these are probably the only, obviously, this is the only link.

12:35.103 --> 12:44.053
Yeah, so you get the sort of the shadows of the originals survive even though the originals are now gone.

12:44.233 --> 12:47.317
This could go into at least three chapters, you know, I mean, copies.

12:48.158 --> 12:54.705
Well, the interesting thing is when he took these photocopies, he requested them and they were actually mailed to him afterwards.

12:55.246 --> 13:03.355
He also took detailed notes of all the features that wouldn't show up on photocopies, like, you know, bindings, watermarks, and so forth.

13:03.824 --> 13:15.576
And I was talking to my friend in Toronto, the woman who is actually doing the logistics of getting the pages from him, and he's handing over his notes to get copied, too.

13:16.738 --> 13:22.424
And she's very interesting woman, very bright scholar.

13:22.444 --> 13:24.906
She's a professor of history.

13:25.407 --> 13:33.375
Her name is Amila, A-M-I-L-A, Buturovich, B as in boy, U-T as in Tom, U,

13:33.625 --> 13:34.886
R-O-V-I-C.

13:35.247 --> 13:36.128
I'd like to talk to her.

13:36.308 --> 13:37.809
Yeah, I can give you her.

13:38.650 --> 13:46.939
Anyway, she is a scholar of the history of religions and did her thesis on a medieval Arabic manuscript.

13:47.960 --> 13:59.192
And she said when she first looked at these copies, she thought, well, some of these are copies of well-known texts.

13:59.212 --> 14:01.995
It really is the importance of having yet another

14:02.414 --> 14:12.366
copy of a well-known text and then she thought about it and she talked to Birnbaum and suddenly she realized that even if these are well-known texts, they illuminate so many things.

14:13.127 --> 14:21.557
First of all, the intellectual life of a local community through tracing who the copyists were, looking at the owner's marks.

14:22.959 --> 14:25.502
From this deducing what books were being copied

14:25.820 --> 14:32.329
what books were being read and collected in a particular locality, who read whom, who commented on whom.

14:32.509 --> 14:36.675
So could you give me an idea of what the time frame of these manuscripts are?

14:37.096 --> 14:40.360
These manuscripts are mainly, I think, from the 16th century.

14:40.380 --> 14:44.386
They're better if they copy.

14:44.406 --> 14:46.448
There have to be differences, too.

14:47.029 --> 14:50.494
I mean, it's not merely a matter of establishing a text.

14:50.862 --> 14:53.986
And then once you have a good critical edition, you don't need the manuscripts.

14:54.006 --> 14:55.328
The history and the cultural life.

14:55.729 --> 15:07.144
The manuscripts themselves are records of people's reading habits, of people's intellectual influences, of book production.

15:08.026 --> 15:17.899
For example, many of these manuscripts stem from one small town in Bosnia, which for a brief time was a provincial capital

15:18.250 --> 15:34.733
and had an intellectual flourishing, and suddenly it had numerous manuscript workshops churning out these things, and you can tell from the people who commissioned manuscripts, they're known from other things, like they founded libraries and institutions.

15:35.594 --> 15:38.077
Like the history of the book, which is now... Exactly.

15:38.718 --> 15:45.287
And so even though, I mean, to give you a Western example, is it...

15:45.740 --> 15:54.689
really crucial to have 20 handwritten commonplace books consisting entirely of excerpts from things like Pilgrim's Progress.

15:55.910 --> 16:07.823
Well, it might be if it throws a light on the community which created it, even though you are perfectly satisfied with the received version of the text itself.

16:07.843 --> 16:13.148
Well, some people might question the wisdom of Owen Gingrich here in Harvard who traveled the world over 20 years to

16:13.583 --> 16:18.491
to find and handle and to look at every first and second edition copy of Copernicus.

16:18.932 --> 16:19.212
Why?

16:19.312 --> 16:23.599
Because he had read somewhere or heard that this was the greatest book never read.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.003
He said, well, he wanted to see.

16:26.304 --> 16:32.153
Maybe let's determine who the earliest owners were and perhaps we can get something out of the annotations in each copy.

16:32.353 --> 16:33.415
Well, it's all the same book.

16:33.597 --> 16:37.985
But every one of these, it turns out to be a really critically important answer.

16:38.787 --> 16:42.634
You know, every one is unique in its own way because it's certainly the ones that bear annotation.

16:42.654 --> 16:43.896
I think that's kind of what you said.

16:43.916 --> 16:47.623
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.

16:48.160 --> 16:53.588
And its production and its function within culture is just such a great... Exactly.

16:53.648 --> 17:10.692
I mean, they're not simply artifacts, as we all know, in terms of... I mean, in effect, I am not a bibliophile in the sense that I have no burning desire to acquire

17:10.942 --> 17:13.064
even hardback copies necessarily.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.267
I acquire books for their content.

17:15.287 --> 17:16.047
You're talking about yourself.

17:16.088 --> 17:21.854
I'm talking about myself, but I mean, but this is an instantiation of what books mainly are about.

17:22.314 --> 17:29.502
You know, magnificent as they may be as artifacts, they are mainly about the transmission of knowledge and communicating ideas.

17:30.203 --> 17:34.047
And that's what Anders is describing, and that's what people seem to forget.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.050
And that's why, of course, they are a primary target.

17:37.317 --> 17:51.631
Well, and then we go, I am going to have a chapter, and I've decided even how I'm going to frame it, and it starts with Harvard, and your book deposits are rejected, which is really quite a very significant commitment to books.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.753
You're saving the books.

17:52.773 --> 17:54.297
Believe me, there are places that I'm saving them.

17:54.445 --> 18:00.034
Well, we certainly know from the history of the San Francisco Public Library.

18:00.054 --> 18:01.015
I have a chapter on that.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.097
I spent a week out there.

18:02.197 --> 18:05.402
I will have the definitive chapter on the San Francisco Public Library.

18:05.422 --> 18:06.984
There are only two people who haven't talked to me.

18:07.345 --> 18:08.166
It's very interesting.

18:08.286 --> 18:12.373
The architect, she's ducking me.

18:12.453 --> 18:13.855
That's fine.

18:14.206 --> 18:20.635
This woman who was president of the Friends of Marjorie Stratton, I can't understand why she won't talk to me.

18:20.655 --> 18:22.177
She's very embarrassed about the way things went.

18:22.398 --> 18:27.304
The day that library opened, there were 200,000 books that they had no shelf space for.

18:28.406 --> 18:30.429
And this is what bothers me.

18:30.449 --> 18:32.792
They got rid of them without even recording the copies.

18:33.753 --> 18:37.859
They didn't even, these books weren't even worthy enough to be recorded.

18:37.879 --> 18:41.244
I mean, when you send people to death camps, at least we might know who they are.

18:41.284 --> 18:43.367
Their names might be recorded someplace.

18:43.527 --> 18:44.128
These are books.

18:44.615 --> 18:53.066
that represent the reading habits, the book culture of San Francisco at a time that these books were important and gone.

18:53.647 --> 18:56.911
To me, that's a very anti-intellectual attitude.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.455
Tell us about it.

19:00.095 --> 19:08.807
To bring us full circle to Sarajevo, it's one of the tragedies of the Sarajevo library, is that their library catalogs burn.

19:08.827 --> 19:10.589
The catalogs, absolutely.

19:11.090 --> 19:12.732
Equally, I mean, they're

19:13.066 --> 19:15.409
But they're a critical part of the apparatus.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.831
So they don't know what they lost.

19:18.052 --> 19:19.553
They don't know what they lost.

19:20.554 --> 19:29.224
And in many cases, I mean in the case of Sarajevo, you're talking about the kind of material that will not turn up in most foreign libraries.

19:29.284 --> 19:35.291
We're talking about small local literary journals, small town newspapers.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.634
Archival materials.

19:38.114 --> 19:41.638
When the National Library in Sarajevo was created,

19:41.888 --> 19:44.231
It wasn't created until the end of World War II.

19:45.393 --> 19:50.559
Before World War II, there were local cultural societies that had large functioning libraries.

19:51.521 --> 20:01.774
And these were merged into the National Library, and then other collections were drawn in, everything from the Library of the Chamber of Commerce to so forth.

20:02.255 --> 20:10.225
And so along with their libraries came their archives, a century of intellectual, political, and social life.

20:10.947 --> 20:19.440
recorded in, you know, all kinds of ephemeral ways, which will be, you know, virtually impossible to reconstruct.

20:19.460 --> 20:23.025
I mean, so you actually are very pessimistic about ephemeral.

20:23.045 --> 20:23.666
This is something.

20:23.686 --> 20:25.509
Well, they were successful in this point.

20:25.529 --> 20:27.151
You cannot recreate the library.

20:27.211 --> 20:28.874
You can reconstruct a library.

20:29.595 --> 20:34.022
In other words, you can contribute to the reconstruction of a library, but you will never recreate what was.

20:34.042 --> 20:39.570
I mean, libraries, like the National University Libraries, serve

20:40.580 --> 20:41.681
a multiple function.

20:41.961 --> 20:52.432
I mean, one is as a repository of a community's collective memory, and so you have the library serving this conserving function.

20:53.754 --> 21:02.262
But libraries also serve a community, both the people who want to look into this record, but also in a very practical way.

21:02.382 --> 21:06.807
Businessmen, engineers, teachers all need library materials.

21:08.491 --> 21:13.533
Just checking everyone, so this stuff is so important.

21:13.613 --> 21:14.316
Go ahead.

21:14.937 --> 21:38.869
these are uh uh canada makia's publications he had an old at first for reasons of personal security uh but uh and this is out of hollis out of hollis yeah so it's under both uh samir akalil and uh anyway so one one is the conserving function the other one is the service function

21:39.507 --> 21:42.193
for education and for practical purposes.

21:42.253 --> 21:44.979
Now, the second one is much easier to reconstruct.

21:47.324 --> 21:55.963
The 30,000 volumes promised by American university presses will go a very long way towards filling that gap.

21:55.983 --> 21:59.170
And many of the new reference resources

21:59.926 --> 22:05.353
are in many ways more functional than some of the old reference works that they may have lost.

22:05.373 --> 22:07.076
And this is where the OCLC project.

22:07.276 --> 22:17.350
And the OCLC project will also go a very long way, especially if, at the end of the article they say, they manage to draw in some of the European libraries.

22:17.730 --> 22:23.959
It will go a very long way towards putting back together a major portion of the published

22:24.293 --> 22:32.508
You know, the function of the National Library as a depository, where everything published in or about the country has at least one copy.

22:33.950 --> 22:47.955
And given the realities of life, it may be that the majority of their copies will be either microforms of things which are now unobtainable, or reprints.

22:48.239 --> 23:09.587
One of the very interesting things that came out of the burning of the Bosnian Library is when the first responses were a couple of Czech and German publishers offered at their own expense to reprint classics of Bosnian literature, they figured for these it was not enough to merely have a master microform somewhere.

23:09.627 --> 23:18.178
These are things that people ought to have and which ought to be able to circulate something which in microphones and CDs really aren't

23:19.070 --> 23:21.874
You talk about the mission of a national library.

23:21.974 --> 23:28.223
I've been to the new French library, the new British library, the new German library.

23:28.763 --> 23:36.073
Went up to Leipzig, where they're leading the world, and these preservation techniques are these big machines.

23:37.095 --> 23:40.519
But every country has a different take on it, you see.

23:40.620 --> 23:44.625
In France, the word you hear everywhere is patrimony.

23:45.026 --> 23:46.748
French peck.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.030
And you go to Italy, it's all humanism.

23:49.050 --> 23:51.192
In Germany, I said, this is very interesting, you know.

23:51.793 --> 24:01.285
You have two libraries that are now, you have the Düsseldorf Bucherei, which is East Germany, and they're all part of the German National Library.

24:01.385 --> 24:07.893
So I asked the Director General, Professor Lehmann, I said, well, are there political considerations that come in?

24:07.913 --> 24:14.341
I mean, are there things from East German history that you don't collect, or how do you decide collecting priorities?

24:14.361 --> 24:15.022
It's very simple.

24:15.543 --> 24:16.684
You can collect the language.

24:17.575 --> 24:18.756
interesting way to do it.

24:18.976 --> 24:23.220
I mean, anything in German or about Germany would collect.

24:23.240 --> 24:46.823
It just seems to be a Gordian way of resolving whether it's about the Nazis or... Well, I have, I can Xerox for you, I have from the Bosnia National Library, one of their first post-war publications, is the result of a conference on the Bosnia National Library and Bosniaka, which is what they call the national

24:47.832 --> 24:57.567
collections, and their basic definition, as I recall, was A, anything on any subject published within the country.

25:00.912 --> 25:11.528
So they're perfectly happy to have a master copy of the works of Tito or whatever, as long as it was published in Bali as part of their history.

25:12.048 --> 25:17.437
And the second is anything published in any language and anywhere about the country.

25:17.497 --> 25:19.199
Germans are basically doing the same thing.

25:19.219 --> 25:21.383
I think it's more dramatic there, actually.

25:21.463 --> 25:27.793
At least the Germans are united by a language and a common culture.

25:27.813 --> 25:30.577
Well, in Bosnia, everybody has the same language.

25:31.799 --> 25:34.243
But they have different cultural strings.

25:34.263 --> 25:36.507
They have different cultural strings, to be sure.

25:36.527 --> 25:39.912
But Germany, too.

25:40.162 --> 25:44.408
the United Germany is not very old.

25:44.448 --> 25:44.829
That's right.

25:45.330 --> 25:48.735
And then you go to Italy, they're princely collections.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.055
That's right.

25:49.075 --> 25:50.838
But similarly, you go to Italy.

25:50.858 --> 25:52.020
I just got back from Italy.

25:52.761 --> 25:56.346
I said, why have you got so many different national libraries all over the place?

25:56.386 --> 25:59.371
Well, I said, you know, Italy as a nation is only 130 years old.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.533
Exactly.

26:00.553 --> 26:08.785
And I was astonished to learn that ecclesiastical libraries, there are more than a thousand ecclesiastical libraries in Italy,

26:09.018 --> 26:13.023
And they come for 27 million books, and that does not include the Vatican Library.

26:13.043 --> 26:15.787
They don't consider themselves one of these ecclesiastical libraries.

26:15.807 --> 26:17.910
Then you've got half a dozen national libraries.

26:17.930 --> 26:19.472
Well, because they're not in Italy.

26:19.492 --> 26:19.953
That's right.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.895
That's exactly right.

26:21.995 --> 26:26.241
But the ecclesiastical library is 27 million.

26:26.321 --> 26:29.886
It's easily got to be as important as what's... So I went to a bunch of them.

26:29.906 --> 26:33.731
I went to the March of Marociana, which just reopened.

26:33.791 --> 26:35.613
Went to the Capitulario, which is wonderful.

26:35.753 --> 26:36.915
It was totally forgotten.

26:37.300 --> 26:42.667
and then a Monte Cassino, went to the Lorenziano, which is an ecclesiastical library.

26:42.687 --> 26:52.359
Oh, if you're going to Venice, by the way, the first book ever printed in the Bosnian vernacular was printed in Venice.

26:52.479 --> 27:06.717
It was a Catholic catechism called Nauchristiansky, and it was published, I think, around 1610 in Venice.

27:07.591 --> 27:15.861
at a time when vernacular publishing still hadn't really gotten going very much in the Balkans.

27:16.702 --> 27:26.234
Dubrovnik had a few Renaissance imprints, but in Serbia, as in Russia, they were still writing books in Church Slavonic, not in the vernacular.

27:28.937 --> 27:35.725
This was distributed in Ottoman Bosnia.

27:36.194 --> 27:37.355
Give me a status report.

27:37.615 --> 27:38.636
How do you feel now?

27:38.676 --> 27:40.999
You've been involved in this ever since almost it happened.

27:42.460 --> 27:43.061
Can you try?

27:43.942 --> 27:46.344
No, this is in reference to the... Sorry, Abel.

27:46.444 --> 27:47.485
Sorry, Abel.

27:47.505 --> 27:50.228
Why don't you just give me a little background about your involvement?

27:50.748 --> 27:58.195
Well, Andros and I, I think, became immediately concerned with the situation in Bosnia at its very outset.

27:58.816 --> 28:04.902
And since we worked as colleagues... Spring of 92.

28:05.422 --> 28:14.233
and in one way or another tried, I think, to establish ways in which we could sort of actively engage the issue.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.198
I started writing letters to the editor on June 11th, 1992.

28:18.258 --> 28:22.644
June 11th being how many days afterwards?

28:22.664 --> 28:28.812
Well, some months after the—no, no, it was before the library itself was destroyed, which was August 25th, 1992.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.895
They started before this?

28:30.935 --> 28:35.040
No, I mean, cultural daily destruction was obvious from the first month of the war.

28:35.341 --> 28:42.290
I mean, you saw pictures in the newspapers of, you know, churches and mosques burned down.

28:43.071 --> 28:47.376
The Oriental Institute in Sarajevo was burned on May 17, 1992.

28:47.536 --> 29:03.576
Also, I mean, general concern over human rights motivated my interest before it became clear that, you know, what can, I think, be fairly called cultural genocide was part of the program.

29:03.877 --> 29:19.675
That was abundantly clear by the time the events of the summer happened and the targeting of cultural institutions was obvious.

29:20.296 --> 29:31.048
I think that the first, as Andras probably pointed out in the first time... Over on the wall there?

29:31.501 --> 29:34.005
Both of us first thought would happen.

29:34.185 --> 29:48.567
The first thing that I think both of us thought is that there are all these professional groups and international organizations.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.832
Surely they ought to do something.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.314
Someone ought to do something.

29:54.697 --> 29:58.943
Should it be UNESCO, the American Library Association, or whatever.

29:59.429 --> 30:05.315
And so the first thing we did is we tried to get organizations to respond.

30:05.335 --> 30:09.679
And the universal response was, we don't meddle in political matters.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.363
Yes, particularly political matters in obscure places that we don't understand.

30:13.744 --> 30:19.910
Yeah, as if the destruction of two million books was a political act.

30:19.930 --> 30:21.852
And as if that was an obscure matter.

30:22.152 --> 30:23.514
Yes.

30:23.754 --> 30:26.837
So what happened is

30:27.509 --> 30:40.609
In the fall of 92, when it became quite clear that no professional organization was going to do anything, we started simply networking on our own.

30:42.152 --> 30:55.272
We had stacks of faxes, we made phone calls, we put out calls on the internet, there were discussions at great length, and finally we decided that we would essentially form our own group.

30:56.011 --> 31:04.722
over 350 academics and librarians who sign this appeal on cultural genocide.

31:05.984 --> 31:10.529
And we managed to raise enough money to take out a full-page ad in the New York Times.

31:11.290 --> 31:13.753
We flew standby on the New York Times.

31:13.894 --> 31:22.204
A full-page ad is very expensive, but you get a little price break if you don't specify a date and a place on the issue.

31:22.538 --> 31:33.169
And so we were sort of circling and waiting for almost a month and a half until it got placed, and it appeared on March 31st of 1993, finally.

31:34.210 --> 31:44.941
The ad itself brought enough response that we were able to republish the ad in the New York Review of Books on July 15th of the same year, 1993.

31:45.201 --> 31:49.626
You'd think the New York Review would almost give you the space.

31:49.927 --> 31:53.230
Well, actually, New York Review gave us a very good break on Price.

31:53.290 --> 31:56.433
I mean, this seems to be the kind of thing that they should be most supportive of.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.115
Well, no, it's strange.

31:58.415 --> 32:06.563
I mean, the New York Review, in terms of its choice of writers, has an equivocal history relative to Bosnia.

32:06.583 --> 32:06.904
Really?

32:07.004 --> 32:15.512
In part, I mean, they did provide a venue for Susan Sontag's memorable and deeply moving account,

32:15.695 --> 32:16.917
She went to Saevo.

32:18.178 --> 32:19.059
Her experience there.

32:19.140 --> 32:21.162
If that's of interest to you, I can get you a copy.

32:21.262 --> 32:22.063
That would be great.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.847
I want to interview Susan Sontag, by the way.

32:24.867 --> 32:25.007
Uh-huh.

32:25.147 --> 32:28.672
Well, then you should, if you do, I would recommend that you read this in advance.

32:28.832 --> 32:30.174
Was that published in 93, I think?

32:31.255 --> 32:31.696
When was that?

32:31.716 --> 32:32.697
Or was that early 94?

32:32.717 --> 32:34.800
I mean, I have the copy readily available.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.343
You give me an address, and I'll send you a card.

32:37.363 --> 32:38.385
Oh, of course.

32:38.505 --> 32:40.928
I'll give you another one.

32:41.008 --> 32:43.131
One to take home, isn't it?

32:43.371 --> 32:43.692
Yeah.

32:43.872 --> 32:44.773
But the...

32:45.125 --> 32:55.282
But they employed Misha Glenny as their sort of primary reviewer of... Make sure this all sticks together.

32:55.322 --> 32:57.446
I just checked and it's taken perfectly.

32:59.089 --> 33:00.371
Okay, so I hope you got enough.

33:01.733 --> 33:04.979
I could get you back to that.

33:04.999 --> 33:07.403
So this is...

33:07.788 --> 33:11.132
That's an article from the French Archaeology Journal.

33:11.733 --> 33:14.075
This is from the Simmons alumni mag.

33:15.157 --> 33:22.505
And they gave me an alumni award for the Login Award from their library school.

33:23.046 --> 33:30.575
Anyway, the only utility of this is it has a talk I gave there, which sort of outlines what Jeff and I told you about the whole history of our involvement.

33:32.837 --> 33:33.458
That's terrific.

33:35.108 --> 33:41.035
And this is somebody else who spoke there by the name of Walter Crawford of the Research Libraries Group.

33:41.115 --> 33:41.976
I told you about him.

33:43.338 --> 33:45.801
And the Millennial Librarian, I'm sure.

33:45.821 --> 33:47.623
That's not that interesting.

33:47.643 --> 33:53.911
The references are at the bottom, so the focus is this book, actually.

33:54.091 --> 33:54.472
Next one.

33:54.492 --> 33:54.972
Excellent.

33:55.673 --> 33:56.033
All right.

33:56.073 --> 34:02.601
Now, the other things I've found are phone numbers and stuff.

34:02.621 --> 34:02.822
Right.

34:04.424 --> 34:04.744
Okay.

34:05.635 --> 34:08.337
Whatever.

34:11.180 --> 34:12.641
Whatever he wants.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.083
He's wanted me to see, so.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.125
You can mail it to me.

34:17.946 --> 34:18.887
I think I better.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.890
It's not in an obvious location right now.

34:24.632 --> 34:32.379
No, I can tell you exactly what it means.

34:32.479 --> 34:35.322
No, it's not this.

34:35.588 --> 34:39.593
But it was like that.

34:39.613 --> 34:39.873
OK.

34:40.394 --> 34:42.036
Anyway, I'll put it in .

34:42.656 --> 34:43.477
So I got everything, right?

34:44.258 --> 34:45.279
Except for that .

34:46.941 --> 34:49.364
Oh, I found it.

34:49.444 --> 34:58.595
Oh, wonderful.

34:59.036 --> 35:01.899
Excellent.

35:01.919 --> 35:03.421
The greatest wizard of book.

35:04.502 --> 35:05.443
Oh, God.

35:07.043 --> 35:12.410
When he was here, I took a lot of oysters, you know.

35:12.671 --> 35:20.081
And he said if his wife found out that he was having oysters without her, he said it would be divorce.

35:20.101 --> 35:27.691
He absolutely adores as well.

35:27.711 --> 35:35.582
Okay, so that first one... Yeah, yeah.

35:39.595 --> 35:50.451
I have 50 of these notebooks, and now they're 250 hours to take.

35:51.854 --> 35:57.983
I have to fill two file cabinets with material.

35:58.003 --> 36:04.793
So, words of the psychoanalyst who I do for the last book, Norman, Haskell Norman.

36:05.465 --> 36:07.347
He says, listen to me now.

36:07.607 --> 36:08.167
I'm your mother.

36:08.187 --> 36:09.308
He says, this is my business.

36:09.328 --> 36:11.430
He says, it's time to go home and write your book.

36:11.650 --> 36:12.671
You've got too much stuff.

36:14.113 --> 36:19.677
The other thing I'll do for you is, let's see.

36:21.639 --> 36:22.060
It's coming.

36:24.362 --> 36:35.151
The other thing I'll do for you is, I have a work in progress, an article that was to go into a proposed volume entitled The Holocaust and the Book.

36:35.789 --> 36:41.819
The publisher didn't like the article, so I have to rework it.

36:41.839 --> 36:44.503
I'll send you the draft, and you can mine it for whatever you want.

36:44.563 --> 36:46.647
Also, I would like to cite it, so tell me how to cite it.

36:46.687 --> 36:50.173
It could even be from an unpublished article, or by that time, it would be a published article.

36:50.253 --> 36:51.835
Well, do you cite websites?

36:52.076 --> 36:54.460
I cite everything where I get my materials from.

36:54.500 --> 37:01.932
Most of my information, and there's a good notice, so you can just say,

37:02.114 --> 37:06.019
And such and such a source cited in the publisher.

37:06.079 --> 37:10.284
Will I have to remind you to finish this?

37:10.784 --> 37:16.692
I can email it to you right now.

37:16.712 --> 37:17.873
You can email it to me even?

37:17.933 --> 37:18.494
Email it to me.

37:18.614 --> 37:19.054
OK.

37:19.074 --> 37:20.016
And you're very welcome.

37:20.096 --> 37:22.959
Thank you so much for having me here.

37:22.979 --> 37:32.070
Look, I just want a hard-written thank to the author

37:32.405 --> 37:42.498
After we turn the Institute, which built a national collection here, is K.W.

37:42.758 --> 37:43.238
Schmerz.

37:43.339 --> 37:48.505
You want a translation of anything into anything.

37:48.525 --> 37:49.526
Do you hear that call it?

37:49.546 --> 37:49.907
Yes.

37:50.027 --> 37:54.172
You do animals and artems.

37:54.192 --> 37:58.738
And I will get you the script.

37:58.758 --> 37:59.679
Really?

37:59.699 --> 37:59.779
Yes.

38:01.582 --> 38:02.924
This is the biggest book.

38:05.187 --> 38:06.509
As you can see, it's very rare.

38:10.154 --> 38:17.484
It doesn't matter how badly it's been.

38:17.504 --> 38:18.845
It's really kind of mad at it.

38:18.866 --> 38:28.078
Frazo actually purchased some 12th character printed books, and his challenge went through great things trying to make sure everything's the last copy of this book.

38:28.683 --> 38:56.513
This is a practical book on this

38:58.923 --> 39:01.907
Nicholas Tolstoy?

39:04.149 --> 39:05.551
I think it's Nicholas.

39:05.791 --> 39:19.367
Oh, it's Nicolai.

39:19.387 --> 39:20.769
I interviewed Nicolai Tolstoy.

39:20.789 --> 39:21.350
That's right.

39:21.370 --> 39:24.093
That's not the sun.

39:24.113 --> 39:24.854
Is he going to be sure?

39:24.874 --> 39:26.936
I want to try it out.

39:26.956 --> 39:27.517
I think it's this way, yeah.

39:27.537 --> 39:27.737
That's it.

39:27.757 --> 39:28.438
It just looked like it, didn't it?

39:28.458 --> 39:28.558
Yeah.

39:29.197 --> 39:44.235
But I should think there's very much a very steady spirit.

39:45.447 --> 39:53.539
The last generation of giants, you know, he reads 20 different languages, half of which are extinct.

39:54.079 --> 39:54.480
Yeah.

39:54.620 --> 40:02.952
And then, you know, he studied at Charles University in Prague, University of Lebanon, Belgium, Harvard.

40:02.972 --> 40:04.815
Somebody told me about it.

40:04.835 --> 40:06.738
Yeah.

40:06.758 --> 40:06.858
Yeah.

40:06.878 --> 40:06.978
Yeah.

40:06.998 --> 40:15.370
Anyway, he was one of the people who helped set up the Ukrainian Institute.

40:16.531 --> 40:27.826
My conscience is much relieved that Nadia has attacked it.

40:27.847 --> 40:34.055
One thing you should know, Kenoff's article is about the Atari Raghavada, as you know.

40:34.195 --> 40:43.148
For rather weird political notions, he left a couple of things on set, or sort of alluded to it.

40:43.228 --> 40:45.711
Yeah, why don't you call me afterwards?

40:46.062 --> 40:56.058
Basically, what he only alludes to in the end is how the Haggadah was rescued during war.

40:56.519 --> 40:59.463
No, no, no, no.

40:59.503 --> 41:12.424
When the museum came under shell fire in the summer of 92, the Haggadah was rescued and put into a wall.

41:13.484 --> 41:16.009
He doesn't have that in the article?

41:16.410 --> 41:17.952
No, he is symbolistic.

41:17.973 --> 41:19.636
Let me read it.

41:20.016 --> 41:30.116
The team director afterwards claimed that he risked all kinds of weird drugs, circumstances, and that came out to bodies of his disability.

41:30.136 --> 41:36.167
And meanwhile, we were celebrating with this, and it resulted in a libelous article in the New Republic.

41:36.400 --> 41:42.872
They never issued a retraction.

41:42.912 --> 41:47.540
How do I get out of here?

41:47.781 --> 41:53.331
Okay, let me show you where.

41:53.451 --> 41:54.994
No, I know.

41:55.234 --> 41:58.560
Okay, thank you, I know.

42:06.573 --> 42:22.852
in this effort, but in my initial communications to him, he misunderstood there to be a national library and a university library, and consequently they decided, well, then they should provide two copies.

42:22.912 --> 42:32.983
Well, as a matter of fact, there are a whole great number of faculty libraries at the university which do exist, ten of which were destroyed as well in the course of the war.

42:34.104 --> 42:35.466
And so,

42:35.648 --> 42:55.308
So this has proved to be a great benefit to our project, to have second copies, because they can be allocated not only to faculty libraries, but also, sort of say, the University of Tuzla library and... You don't have to explain it.

42:55.648 --> 43:05.638
It's so obvious why, you know, that... Anyway, we tried to... It's my fond hope that we'll be able to encourage some of the other presses at some point to...

43:06.007 --> 43:11.153
But how about the initial goal of trying to replicate the losses?

43:11.173 --> 43:11.634
Well, no, no.

43:11.714 --> 43:19.303
I mean, the same thing is, as I, in effect, said earlier, we won't replicate the losses.

43:19.703 --> 43:35.102
The in-gathering projects, you know, every manuscript reclaimed, however, virtually, will be, you know, one strike for history and knowledge and culture.

43:35.437 --> 43:38.401
But there's simply no way.

43:38.902 --> 43:51.941
When the Oriental Institute burned and its thousands of original manuscripts went up in smoke, there is no way that anything but a small fraction of those will be retrieved, in total, at least.

43:52.803 --> 44:05.241
So at least in terms of my focus, that is on the practical matter of trying to reconstruct adequate collections to support

44:05.761 --> 44:10.748
the ongoing and critical process of education.

44:11.188 --> 44:19.940
You know, I mean, no society has a future if its students, its young people aren't educated.

44:19.960 --> 44:34.840
This was a blow, you know, another blow against the future of Bosnia by sort of undermining the capacity of the educational process to

44:34.955 --> 44:41.322
Are you saying then that this attempt at cultural genocide was at least partially successful?

44:41.503 --> 45:04.489
Well, one cannot deny that at this point it's clear that approximately 2,000 monuments of historical notes were destroyed, that these enormous library collections and other archives were destroyed, and you can

45:05.414 --> 45:17.961
Your efforts, you can make strenuous efforts to create functioning institutions, functioning educational, cultural institutions, but you cannot fully retrieve what was lost.

45:18.001 --> 45:18.903
There's simply no way.

45:19.945 --> 45:23.473
In some cases, with architecture, you can create simulacra,

45:23.926 --> 45:29.094
But those simulacra will have none of the authentic and original furnishings.

45:29.715 --> 45:32.178
Monuments aren't simply the mortar.

45:32.839 --> 45:35.283
Three weeks ago I was at Monte Cassino.

45:35.824 --> 45:39.369
As a matter of fact, I was amazed that there was a library to see at Monte Cassino.

45:39.389 --> 45:41.412
Are they totally rebuilt?

45:41.999 --> 45:45.303
I mean, it looks like an ancient abbey.

45:45.383 --> 45:48.546
Did you see on my web page the story of the Naples?

45:48.906 --> 45:50.428
Yes, I printed it out.

45:50.608 --> 45:53.031
I mean, that's a really amazing thing.

45:53.051 --> 45:53.732
Yeah, that's right.

45:53.752 --> 45:58.276
All of these stories you see are all... This is what a million and a half books burning looks like.

45:58.296 --> 45:58.477
Wow.

45:58.877 --> 46:01.940
And this book here is... Sorry for the Wounded City.

46:02.721 --> 46:06.325
It's a picture diary of the first year of the siege.

46:06.505 --> 46:08.828
Look at that.

46:08.848 --> 46:11.010
I mean, you can see clearly enough.

46:11.918 --> 46:16.406
We might want to get copies of these.

46:16.566 --> 46:18.490
I mean, my publisher might.

46:18.510 --> 46:19.371
They really are.

46:19.572 --> 46:25.843
I can probably connect you with the... I can connect you probably with the

46:26.380 --> 46:30.787
This was just published in Sarajevo after the war.

46:30.807 --> 46:31.849
This book was.

46:31.869 --> 46:40.383
One of the many sad things about the destruction of the library was that... I want to take down the publication information.

46:40.463 --> 46:43.107
The head cataloger...

46:43.812 --> 46:56.524
As you doubtless know from the conversations with Kondrash, a further catalyst to our practical action was the visit of Dr. Kiyunjic, the director of the National Library here in October of 1994.

46:57.145 --> 47:02.289
That really galvanized our efforts in a more practical direction.

47:03.711 --> 47:11.558
We sort of facilitated his meeting with various people here at Harvard, at MIT, at the Boston Public Library, at Simmons College,

47:11.774 --> 47:27.656
And ultimately, he did give his public address at the Boston Public Library that James Carroll attended, which led then further to Carroll's series of essays in the Globe, which you are aware of.

47:28.017 --> 47:39.773
And that ultimately proved extraordinarily beneficial to our project, because he, as

47:40.124 --> 47:52.021
When the war finally ended, and Carroll wrote his sort of exhortation to support our project, that elicited a response from the public.

47:52.401 --> 47:58.650
It also, this series of essays were something that we could take to President Brudenstein, in effect.

47:58.830 --> 48:01.374
Jim's essays.

48:01.394 --> 48:02.335
Jim's essays.

48:02.669 --> 48:11.419
It so happens that Jackie O'Neill, the personal assistant to President Nudenstein, was a close personal friend of James Carroll.

48:11.559 --> 48:12.820
That didn't occur either.

48:13.161 --> 48:15.263
I've interviewed Jim several times.

48:15.683 --> 48:19.608
Yeah, yeah, I saw that you'd done something relative to his memoir.

48:19.808 --> 48:28.778
I did the big Peter Publishers Weekly piece, and I did a column for my newspaper column, and I've interviewed him several times.

48:29.078 --> 48:29.619
way back.

48:29.799 --> 48:30.100
I see.

48:30.320 --> 48:45.805
I read his memoir, it was a remarkable, fascinating book, and of course, in a more modest way, I, and at a younger age, I had a very similar, a parallel experience, you know, well, you know, I mean,

48:46.139 --> 48:50.205
My father was the colonel in the reserves, after all, not a general in charge or whatever.

48:50.765 --> 49:07.849
But nevertheless, you know, being an activist in the anti-war movement, it made it... What I found, the critical difference between our experiences was that he didn't participate in the Cultural Revolution.

49:07.869 --> 49:13.277
He participated in the... In other words, he was older, he was a priest,

49:13.814 --> 49:22.382
And so sort of my embrace of counterculture was simply didn't play—you notice, it was completely absent from his memoir.

49:22.603 --> 49:25.512
He was living with priests, at least.

49:25.610 --> 49:32.219
Yeah, so it was very interesting to see the similarities and contrast in our own personal experience.

49:32.579 --> 49:34.602
And it was an exceptionally compelling story.

49:34.622 --> 49:38.487
Best book he ever wrote, and it's non-fiction, you know, and he's known for his novels.

49:38.707 --> 49:40.870
Yeah, well... I'll give him a call, actually.

49:40.890 --> 49:43.073
The guy in his front phone, I guess there's no problem.

49:43.353 --> 49:46.016
He might actually get his comments on this.

49:46.117 --> 49:50.342
Is there a text available of the talk that was given at the DPL, do you think?

49:50.382 --> 49:53.406
No, I don't remember that we have one.

49:53.656 --> 49:57.622
I would like to say it was very forceful.

49:57.702 --> 50:07.056
He's a very angry man, but he's a very angry man under control, and his English is excellent.

50:07.076 --> 50:14.547
He did a Master's at the University of Chicago, and he was a very compelling exponent for the library.

50:14.567 --> 50:22.178
It was very interesting because many months later the head cataloger came, and she

50:23.693 --> 50:28.380
She was in a state of acute post-traumatic stress when she arrived here.

50:29.321 --> 50:34.909
And she was a shambles, an emotional shambles.

50:36.532 --> 50:49.110
We had thought that she would give a similar talk at the Austin Public Library, only to discover that she was so terrified at the prospect of the Serbs attending, you know, someone taking her name.

50:49.394 --> 50:55.040
You know, that she was petrified and refused to permit us any publicity.

50:55.760 --> 51:03.708
Consequently, we had her talk, but there were six total in the room, including herself and Arash and myself.

51:04.128 --> 51:07.812
And it was tragic because I have a text.

51:08.273 --> 51:09.073
I have a text of that.

51:11.276 --> 51:13.117
Because it was a very different kind of talk.

51:13.157 --> 51:14.258
She was not an executive.

51:14.379 --> 51:15.840
She was not in charge.

51:16.057 --> 51:18.000
speaking for the institution.

51:18.120 --> 51:33.381
She was speaking as an individual who had suffered the trauma of a two-hour commute on foot every day from the furthest suburb in government hands to the library under shell fire.

51:33.641 --> 51:36.045
And I will happily give you one.

51:36.125 --> 51:39.750
I'll use it to cite it, of course.

51:40.150 --> 51:42.013
This is precisely the stuff I'm looking for.

51:42.635 --> 51:48.681
And I must say that by the halfway through her talk, everyone in that room, including herself and us, were in tears.

51:48.921 --> 51:53.605
It was just... Did the BPL routinely, did they videotape these?

51:54.006 --> 51:54.266
No.

51:54.947 --> 51:56.728
Well, they certainly didn't record.

51:56.748 --> 51:58.750
I mean, as I say, I have her text.

52:00.012 --> 52:04.316
Do we have a record of Kouroudis's address at the BPL?

52:05.617 --> 52:06.157
I don't remember.

52:06.678 --> 52:08.680
I have a copy of his type script.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.662
It's kind of chaotic, but it's all pretty good.

52:11.422 --> 52:11.983
It's a lot.

52:12.318 --> 52:16.024
Nothing wrong with that.

52:16.084 --> 52:18.908
I'd like to ask if I had this at hand.

52:18.928 --> 52:22.254
This is Sabre Foundation, our partner with this project.

52:22.935 --> 52:24.497
Well, I can photopop it for you.

52:24.858 --> 52:26.460
Why don't I do that right now?

52:26.480 --> 52:28.343
It's just S-A-B-R-E?

52:28.403 --> 52:34.613
Yeah, www.sabre.org.

52:36.061 --> 52:38.643
and just look for their blogging page, and you'll get a lot of it.

52:38.663 --> 52:41.486
If that's on the site, then, Jeff, I can pull it out.

52:41.546 --> 52:44.429
Is there anything in here?

52:44.509 --> 52:44.829
Maybe.

52:44.849 --> 52:47.171
I mean, you might as well, I think.

52:48.172 --> 52:51.335
Anyway, can you hand me a pen?

52:51.355 --> 52:53.317
I can give you something out of that here.

53:05.088 --> 53:05.528
There you are.

53:11.161 --> 53:17.868
First of all, you can get your own copy of this book.

53:18.008 --> 53:33.104
One of the people you should go visit is the guy from whom I bought this book.

53:34.226 --> 53:36.828
He is a very amazing gentleman.

53:36.908 --> 53:38.350
I'll give you a copy of his card.

53:38.887 --> 53:41.691
Is he the person from whom I could get a copy of this book?

53:41.711 --> 53:42.172
Yes.

53:42.192 --> 53:46.919
He is Bosnia's largest book distributor and book import exporter.

53:48.261 --> 53:52.207
His name is Mr. Shaheen Prashic.

53:52.487 --> 53:53.949
I'll get you his card.

53:53.969 --> 53:54.750
Okay, good.

53:55.872 --> 53:57.074
That's great.

53:57.274 --> 54:02.702
Mr. Shaheen Prashic is a very amazing gentleman.

54:03.763 --> 54:06.227
Thanks a lot.

54:11.911 --> 54:15.719
First of all, your pen here.

54:16.601 --> 54:16.941
Oh, OK.

54:16.961 --> 54:17.763
Yep, I got another pen.

54:17.783 --> 54:18.845
You want to hold on to that pen?

54:18.865 --> 54:19.066
No.

54:19.507 --> 54:22.112
You got another one out here.

54:22.132 --> 54:24.437
Confused, because I thought I'd made some other Xeroxes.

54:24.517 --> 54:28.024
I just wondered why I put them.

54:28.044 --> 54:28.806
Um, Mr. Schein, I thought they just
