00:04.402 --> 00:25.372
I can get a... I can get a comment, but I don't know if it's true.

00:25.392 --> 00:25.873
Are we changing it, sir?

00:25.893 --> 00:26.394
I thought we took a left.

00:26.414 --> 00:26.954
I don't know if it's right.

00:26.974 --> 00:27.435
We couldn't explain it.

00:27.455 --> 00:27.956
That's right, number two.

00:27.976 --> 00:28.356
Yeah, that's right.

00:28.376 --> 00:28.817
What do you mean, sir?

00:28.837 --> 00:29.598
I don't know if it's not a number two.

00:29.618 --> 00:30.139
I've never seen it at all.

00:41.628 --> 01:10.960
I don't know how to do it.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.282
Thank you.

01:56.941 --> 01:58.342
We definitely did like it.

01:58.362 --> 01:59.764
We came down the street.

02:00.945 --> 02:08.992
I definitely did like it.

02:09.012 --> 02:12.075
You know where that black?

02:12.635 --> 02:13.096
Straight up there, huh?

02:13.116 --> 02:15.017
It's not far from there, is it?

02:15.037 --> 02:20.783
Yeah, it does drive from there, huh?

02:20.803 --> 02:22.124
You see the shops there.

02:22.965 --> 02:25.547
No, I'm right at the gate now.

02:31.298 --> 02:58.707
So we came down here.

03:05.065 --> 03:31.461
They don't come much harder.

03:31.745 --> 03:47.469
It didn't help me at all.

03:47.490 --> 03:47.990
You know what I'm saying?

03:48.010 --> 03:48.551
You know what I'm speaking?

03:48.571 --> 03:48.872
Well, I get it.

03:48.892 --> 03:49.072
I get it.

03:49.092 --> 03:49.793
It doesn't matter where to move on.

03:49.813 --> 03:50.274
I get the trip to home.

03:50.294 --> 03:51.135
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

03:51.155 --> 03:51.876
And I get to grab them and see them.

03:51.896 --> 03:52.738
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

03:52.758 --> 03:53.599
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

03:53.619 --> 03:54.460
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.322
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

03:55.342 --> 03:56.183
I get to tell them to get in a phone call.

04:12.852 --> 04:40.787
But I hope you get these very good pictures, yeah?

04:40.807 --> 04:40.907
Yeah.

04:40.927 --> 04:41.227
Say that again?

04:41.247 --> 04:41.728
That's a normal picture.

05:47.048 --> 05:57.486
That's right.

05:57.506 --> 05:57.767
That's right.

06:21.524 --> 06:29.273
Thank you very much.

06:30.198 --> 06:58.551
... ... ... ... ...

07:13.347 --> 07:36.739
... ... ... ... ...

07:43.621 --> 07:57.594
Thank you.

07:57.614 --> 07:57.815
Thank you.

07:57.835 --> 07:58.035
Thank you.

08:30.179 --> 08:49.386
Let's see.

09:14.324 --> 09:17.112
Thank you.

09:49.120 --> 10:16.765
There's a lot of what they say.

10:18.365 --> 10:37.596
That's something they use for it, and they need to take it.

10:37.616 --> 10:38.056
I think it's original.

10:38.076 --> 10:39.418
I want you to get to the right to know the first potential of that.

10:39.439 --> 10:39.979
What's that actually on me?

10:39.999 --> 10:41.963
You know, when you enroll from the outside, you know, we're going to be able to have Captain Buck.

10:41.983 --> 10:42.223
That's true.

10:42.243 --> 10:42.624
Heck, that's right.

10:42.644 --> 10:42.904
That's right.

10:43.441 --> 11:04.312
What is that?

11:04.332 --> 11:04.572
That's good.

11:21.747 --> 11:47.783
It's very early, by the way.

11:47.803 --> 11:48.244
Like 20 minutes early.

12:16.878 --> 12:24.189
Highgate.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.314
Highgate.

12:27.334 --> 12:37.350
Highgate.

12:45.430 --> 13:10.887
I was afraid you could go in the wrong way.

13:10.907 --> 13:11.708
I thought you could go in the wrong way.

13:11.728 --> 13:12.530
I thought you could go in the wrong way.

13:12.550 --> 13:13.351
I thought you could go in the wrong way.

13:13.371 --> 13:14.172
I thought you could go in the wrong way.

13:16.683 --> 13:24.533
Hemp said it's only two kilometers this way, so we're probably pretty close.

13:53.268 --> 14:07.331
Do you know what people have called the Flack?

14:07.351 --> 14:09.475
Do you know what that is?

14:09.495 --> 14:09.615
Flack.

14:09.635 --> 14:09.755
Flack.

14:09.775 --> 14:09.976
The Flack.

14:09.996 --> 14:10.096
Yeah.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.300
If you go down there.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.465
Go on this one, yeah.

14:15.485 --> 14:15.906
The next street down.

14:15.926 --> 14:17.007
The next street down, point two.

14:17.027 --> 14:17.388
You go left.

14:17.408 --> 14:17.648
Can I close?

14:17.668 --> 14:18.670
Can I close?

14:18.690 --> 14:19.331
First corner, right street down.

14:19.351 --> 14:19.612
First corner.

14:19.632 --> 14:19.832
Thank you.

14:20.926 --> 14:46.873
You're right, you can go to the first corner and take a left.

14:46.893 --> 14:46.993
Here?

14:47.013 --> 14:47.113
Yeah.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.335
I was in every age of waiting if you'd ever seen that place.

14:48.355 --> 14:48.655
Turn me around.

15:01.865 --> 15:19.806
I remember...

15:30.046 --> 15:55.581
I don't know what it's coming like.

15:56.084 --> 16:01.524
Okay, let's be sure which left, which is clear and which left it was.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.128
I think it's a different one.

16:04.623 --> 16:27.252
It's a little more of the front, front of the back here.

16:27.272 --> 16:27.373
Yeah.

16:27.393 --> 16:29.595
And then you come across, to the right of you there'll be a sort of big piece.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.997
You go past that and it'll be on your left when you get to the place.

16:31.017 --> 16:31.558
Oh yeah, thank you so much.

16:58.235 --> 17:18.258
Let's take it out.

17:18.278 --> 17:18.458
Let's go.

17:18.478 --> 17:18.659
Let's go.

17:18.679 --> 17:18.859
Let's go.

17:32.356 --> 17:58.903
That's why I can walk here in front of you.

17:59.542 --> 18:06.750
Oh!

18:55.533 --> 19:16.866
A flask.

19:41.078 --> 19:46.414
That's a good one.

19:47.086 --> 20:11.760
I'm just going to go ahead and schedule it with Mr. Kuhn.

20:12.230 --> 20:39.283
Thank you.

20:39.303 --> 20:39.503
Thank you.

20:45.929 --> 21:02.740
Thank you.
