WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:04.884
We're talking of Jackson.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.427
Just do that again about the substance collection.

00:07.447 --> 00:18.657
Well, I conceive myself as a substance collector, someone who collects not only the object in a certain condition, but understanding the dynamics of what goes into it.

00:19.438 --> 00:32.991
That collection, the reading of it, the understanding of the intellectual background, as opposed to someone else who collects the object for itself and the condition and becomes the completist, where he has to collect every A and B.

00:33.275 --> 00:34.720
item, bibliographic item.

00:35.844 --> 00:41.484
As Buckley, Matthew Buckley has done with Fitzgerald, for instance, and I probably did.

00:41.504 --> 00:45.478
Well, no, Scarlet Letter he did, famous for collecting every edition.

00:45.998 --> 00:49.042
up to the 100th or 200 edition, and just to show.

00:49.563 --> 00:51.125
And my answer is, so what?

00:51.145 --> 00:52.486
I mean, what does that mean?

00:52.506 --> 00:53.988
There's nothing scurrily about it.

00:54.529 --> 00:57.453
It's an object that, you know, you put up on a shelf.

00:57.773 --> 00:58.854
What did he do with it, you know?

00:59.155 --> 01:01.077
He gave it away, I think, to the library.

01:01.117 --> 01:08.106
Well, you see, now, his Fitzgerald collection, he has just sold to South Carolina, I think, for like a million or two million dollars.

01:08.507 --> 01:08.987
Did you know that?

01:09.047 --> 01:11.651
Yeah, it was in the 8th century.

01:12.031 --> 01:12.752
I was going to get out.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.195
He had a conference there for the 100th anniversary.

01:16.053 --> 01:26.167
I'm interested in this because here's a collector, a scholar, a writer, and in a way influencing, I mean, a canon in a way.

01:26.247 --> 01:29.211
It doesn't, even though Fitzgerald is part of it without any problem.

01:29.651 --> 01:35.860
But you do affect every evaluation, don't you, in a way, when you have these conferences?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.403
Absolutely.

01:38.563 --> 01:44.912
Just like I did with this art conference, by having the conference bringing all these national speakers in,

01:45.162 --> 01:51.450
And talking about painter A, B, and C, you now have elevated them to a focal point.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.512
He does a Fitzgerald conference.

01:54.974 --> 01:59.800
And Fitzgerald, who's been on the decline for a while now, will be back up.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.461
I think so.

02:00.681 --> 02:02.484
I think so.

02:02.504 --> 02:06.489
And that incidentally is worth me going down to talk to him about, by the way.

02:07.330 --> 02:07.770
Yeah.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.412
It's going to work.

02:09.432 --> 02:14.038
Let's get back to the substance stuff that you were saying.

02:15.267 --> 02:20.898
When we were back in your office, you didn't use the word eclectic to describe your collecting.

02:20.918 --> 02:21.920
You used another phrase.

02:21.940 --> 02:22.822
Do you remember what it was?

02:23.623 --> 02:25.888
It was nice.

02:25.948 --> 02:29.074
I wrote it down in the other notebook.

02:29.094 --> 02:29.435
Oh, I didn't.

02:29.455 --> 02:29.735
No, I forgot.

02:29.755 --> 02:30.657
But it's not eclectic.

02:30.677 --> 02:36.769
You didn't use that word, which is almost a casual word.

02:37.002 --> 02:40.866
And I think with yourself, it's more studied.

02:40.966 --> 02:43.228
I mean, it's more considered, I guess, is probably the word.

02:43.308 --> 02:44.269
Well, the word is considered.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.070
I mean, thoughtful.

02:45.150 --> 02:50.535
But, I mean, I, you know, fell into... I started collecting Dickens because Dickens was a favorite author.

02:50.555 --> 02:53.838
I bought a Thomas Wolfe, you know, because it was a favorite author.

02:53.878 --> 02:57.821
And I started getting into different areas, and I thought through it, and then would go on from there.

02:57.841 --> 03:04.568
I said, it's easy to collect a Hemingway or John... or Grapes of Breath.

03:04.588 --> 03:05.929
I mean, it doesn't take any...

03:06.263 --> 03:07.485
challenge or hunt.

03:08.526 --> 03:10.388
You need to be, you learn.

03:10.568 --> 03:15.294
So my collecting habits have always been to branch out, to learn.

03:16.075 --> 03:17.136
How long have you collected?

03:17.817 --> 03:18.919
Since the late 70s.

03:20.761 --> 03:22.003
Starting at about what age?

03:23.164 --> 03:26.929
What would you say?

03:26.949 --> 03:28.751
40, 42.

03:31.935 --> 03:32.175
Okay.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.498
There's a difference in, you know, but then all,

03:35.255 --> 03:36.457
collector's home's existence.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.198
Of course.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.241
You know, individuality here.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.725
But this is not all the material I have.

03:43.285 --> 03:45.648
The Burroughs material I'll show you tomorrow.

03:51.015 --> 03:53.919
So tell me where we are to describe this room.

03:54.680 --> 04:00.908
Well, this is an edition that I put on about 17 years ago.

04:02.052 --> 04:07.221
for collecting books, and I've actually, it's the second library, and I've actually outgrown it.

04:08.123 --> 04:13.032
And I have some problems, you know, just because of the amount of material I have.

04:14.374 --> 04:24.432
But in here, in this room, I see O'Neill, and the Books and Parts, and the Thackeray, and the Kruk-Shanks, and I have an early American

04:24.918 --> 04:27.020
collection down there.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.964
Now this is, what you said earlier, is a new collection, right, or something?

04:31.044 --> 04:32.145
I'm starting it, right.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.646
I've got more books upstairs.

04:34.647 --> 04:37.370
And the books and parts are private press books.

04:37.390 --> 04:38.751
I also collect Night Paul.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.954
I noticed that in the other room, yeah.

04:41.974 --> 04:44.537
I gather because he's a travel writer, I imagine.

04:44.557 --> 04:50.983
Right, and Matheson, and Marquez, and Pritchett, who I think is a great writer, and Wilson.

04:51.003 --> 04:53.305
But those are not major collections.

04:53.943 --> 04:58.067
but the Meredith, you know, the books and parts, the triple-deckers.

04:59.189 --> 05:00.610
Describe a triple-decker.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.034
It's simply a book that was issued in three volumes.

05:04.574 --> 05:06.957
It was a very popular way in the 19th century.

05:06.997 --> 05:12.683
The lending libraries would make more money by issuing books in three sections.

05:15.786 --> 05:19.910
Why are you interested in parts, books and parts?

05:21.832 --> 05:23.494
Well, what I wrote in the article

05:23.845 --> 05:25.467
a little monograph I did.

05:26.128 --> 05:53.262
But I started as a Dickens collector and I got fascinated with the structure of the novel in that the writer would shape the novel by the fact that they either write for deadlines and for over a series of times and so there's always these cliffhangers, these soap opera approach and Dickens, although he wasn't the first, ultimately personified the genre and

05:53.478 --> 06:05.870
It started back in the 16th century, 17th century, and Stephen King is a great example of books issued in serial form.

06:06.251 --> 06:06.972
Stephen King?

06:06.992 --> 06:08.033
Stephen King.

06:08.053 --> 06:08.593
I didn't know that.

06:09.134 --> 06:10.976
The Green Mile.

06:11.056 --> 06:21.286
I don't read the guy, so it's... Well, I didn't either, but what happened was he was issued... I read about this in November, and I wrote him.

06:21.987 --> 06:22.507
You wrote King?

06:22.527 --> 06:23.248
Did he write you back?

06:24.173 --> 06:28.140
Well, no, he called me.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.283
I said I was doing this exhibition.

06:31.525 --> 06:36.333
He must have been pretty flattered that you did that.

06:36.393 --> 06:38.897
Well, I put this in my Griller Club exhibition.

06:39.458 --> 06:44.446
And so he gave me all his material here, which I used to display.

06:45.108 --> 06:49.675
He gave me his manuscript for the first chapter.

06:54.076 --> 07:02.084
And this is his... So it's really nice of him to... That's the Green Mile, 1982.

07:02.104 --> 07:04.207
1996.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.169
That's the page.

07:06.249 --> 07:07.150
Oh, sorry.

07:07.170 --> 07:07.410
Okay.

07:08.011 --> 07:16.559
And what's unique about this book is all six books are on the New York Times bestseller list.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.200
All six.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.204
All six dominate the... Wow, it's very impressive.

07:21.224 --> 07:23.186
And they're all issued in paper, is that right?

07:23.246 --> 07:23.847
Right, here they are.

07:24.873 --> 07:25.414
I saw them.

07:26.014 --> 07:26.155
Yeah.

07:26.335 --> 07:28.157
Let's just read some of the titles if we can.

07:29.258 --> 07:30.220
The Mouse on the Mile.

07:31.021 --> 07:31.802
Coffee's Hand.

07:33.183 --> 07:34.445
Night Journey.

07:34.465 --> 07:36.007
Coffee on the Mile.

07:36.027 --> 07:37.869
Coffee must be the character, obviously.

07:37.889 --> 07:38.270
Yeah.

07:38.590 --> 07:39.391
Coffee on the Mile.

07:40.432 --> 07:42.215
The Bad Death of Edward Delacroix.

07:42.775 --> 07:44.097
D-E-L-A-C-R-O-X.

07:44.117 --> 07:46.440
And this is, they call it the serial thriller.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.783
Continues, continues, concludes.

07:48.803 --> 07:53.008
Six parts.

07:53.028 --> 07:53.108
Hmm.

07:54.522 --> 08:21.357
That's pretty nice.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.863
Yeah, and all I did was I wrote to him.

08:23.883 --> 08:24.885
Yeah, that's pretty good.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.089
I wrote to him, and I said, you know, would it be possible?

08:28.729 --> 08:29.530
He called me up.

08:29.751 --> 08:30.672
I was in the Bahamas.

08:30.932 --> 08:32.294
I called him back from the Bahamas.

08:32.334 --> 08:33.435
He said he'd love to do it.

08:33.976 --> 08:34.417
Oh, that's great.

08:34.437 --> 08:43.148
We talked about Cleveland, and, you know, and then the subsequent, I talked to him again, invited him to come, but he talked about The Shining, which he just redid.

08:43.528 --> 08:46.091
He's a very nice person, and I just asked him.

08:46.111 --> 08:47.934
Apparently, everybody said everybody had texted him.

08:47.954 --> 08:48.755
Yeah, I just asked him.

08:51.078 --> 08:51.478
So...

08:52.083 --> 08:58.209
Anyway, so this is, you know, something I just got and did, because I would love to have had this book.

08:58.229 --> 09:05.617
And I thought it was a nice symmetry between a 1710 book that I had and a 1996 book.

09:05.918 --> 09:07.059
What was the 1710 book?

09:07.159 --> 09:09.241
Mrs. Tussard's Husband Trees.

09:09.381 --> 09:09.962
Okay.

09:10.743 --> 09:12.244
It's a book about agriculture.

09:12.264 --> 09:13.065
1710.

09:13.245 --> 09:16.809
It's the only book known that's in parts before 1800.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.971
And you have that?

09:19.171 --> 09:21.634
I have it, and I showed it at the video.

09:22.508 --> 09:25.932
So, anyway, that's... Did he inscribe anything for you?

09:26.172 --> 09:26.453
No.

09:26.893 --> 09:31.178
I couldn't ask him because... Would it be nice if he just did it?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.740
He did it, but he didn't.

09:32.900 --> 09:41.510
I was asking him to display, and I really... I owe him a letter, and I just haven't had... I really haven't... Did you send him the catalog?

09:43.092 --> 09:43.753
Yes, I did.

09:44.354 --> 09:44.994
I'm pretty sure I did.

09:45.014 --> 09:45.435
You should.

09:46.156 --> 09:48.458
Inscribe one instead of... You know what?

09:48.478 --> 09:49.900
I don't think I should do that.

09:50.605 --> 09:54.249
Pardon me for a... No, I think I did send him a catalog.

09:54.269 --> 09:55.370
I'm going to get something back.

09:55.410 --> 09:56.291
You see what I'm saying?

09:56.311 --> 09:56.411
Yeah.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.274
You know, I think I did.

09:59.314 --> 10:02.157
I have to check my... Is that a good idea?

10:02.177 --> 10:03.258
Of course that's a good idea.

10:04.299 --> 10:08.283
I think I did, but... It's just pure public relations to the end.

10:08.603 --> 10:17.852
I mean, listen, I have a couple... But anyway, so... This room is filled with lots of treasures.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.595
A lot of types.

10:20.828 --> 10:28.415
And so I started with books and parts and literature, and since then I've gravitated towards books and parts.

10:28.435 --> 10:30.578
I mean, I have an Autobahn in parts.

10:30.598 --> 10:32.680
Do you?

10:32.780 --> 10:33.601
Elephants?

10:33.621 --> 10:35.122
No, not the elephants.

10:35.322 --> 10:35.723
Quartos.

10:35.743 --> 10:36.784
Quartos, yeah.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.685
Which is pretty nice.

10:37.765 --> 10:38.265
Still nice.

10:38.986 --> 10:39.086
Yeah.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.668
The elephant time is too expensive.

10:41.688 --> 10:48.355
And I collected books, you know, agriculture.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.843
agriculture and books on architecture.

10:51.765 --> 10:52.786
Now, why architecture?

10:52.827 --> 10:53.347
You're a lawyer.

10:56.653 --> 10:57.173
I'll show you.

10:59.577 --> 11:00.118
Bamboo.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.722
I mean, you're just fascinated with it.

11:02.742 --> 11:09.173
And when you buy them in the original condition, you're buying something that speaks of a period.

11:09.373 --> 11:10.595
And I love architecture.

11:11.256 --> 11:15.102
This is Gardens of Rome.

11:16.769 --> 11:28.462
Oh, goodness my, look at that.

11:28.723 --> 11:33.969
It's extraordinary.

11:34.049 --> 11:35.290
Everything quite wonderful.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.854
You know, do you have to be an expert in this area?

11:38.874 --> 11:39.795
No, no.

11:39.815 --> 11:42.138
But that's the beauty of the exquisite things.

11:42.198 --> 11:46.523
You don't have to... I'm going to show you an early, then I started collecting early lithography.

11:47.296 --> 11:50.159
and early color plates because it just fastened in.

11:50.179 --> 11:52.682
It's the MDCCIX 1809.

11:56.125 --> 11:56.606
See that look?

11:56.646 --> 12:00.350
It's hardly foxed at all, very marginally.

12:00.390 --> 12:04.274
It's a beautiful quality paper, isn't it?

12:04.294 --> 12:05.755
Oh, it's one that, I mean, it's unique.

12:07.237 --> 12:14.625
You know, I've checked it with, you know, it hasn't been a, as far as I know, in this century, there hasn't been one on the market with this.

12:15.165 --> 12:16.847
Now, is it desirable?

12:17.097 --> 12:18.719
It is a desirable book.

12:20.561 --> 12:25.948
And we should say the dimensions of this are basically elephant, right?

12:26.068 --> 12:27.169
Elephant folio cells.

12:27.209 --> 12:29.112
Easily.

12:29.873 --> 12:30.934
Three feet.

12:31.074 --> 12:32.836
You keep it standing like that, right?

12:32.856 --> 12:34.438
Yeah, I haven't really quite figured out.

12:34.899 --> 12:40.866
I actually alternate that because I'm not quite sure what to do with it.

12:41.467 --> 12:42.328
But then there's

12:47.540 --> 12:48.901
Keep the lighting low in here.

12:49.422 --> 12:50.923
I'm glad about that.

12:51.564 --> 12:52.685
That's a Rockwell Kent.

12:52.825 --> 12:53.946
That's the original drawing.

12:54.927 --> 12:59.011
Einstein and Thomas Mann sold that at an auction in 1938.

12:59.572 --> 13:00.833
This book makes the home.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.355
This particular poem.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.196
Is this a poster?

13:04.236 --> 13:04.637
What is it?

13:04.757 --> 13:08.420
It was meant to be a poster, but it's the original drawing for the poster.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.863
That's the original drawing.

13:12.144 --> 13:15.167
They sold it as a benefit for German refugees.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.050
What year you know offhand?

13:18.110 --> 13:19.211
30s must be, huh?

13:19.231 --> 13:20.773
Well, it was sold in 1938.

13:20.993 --> 13:25.057
That was a good guess, wasn't it?

13:25.097 --> 13:25.838
Yeah, right.

13:26.399 --> 13:27.440
That's the original, though.

13:27.660 --> 13:27.920
Yeah.

13:29.262 --> 13:30.383
Look at the condition of this.

13:32.205 --> 13:32.905
In the original.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.067
They're just gorgeous scenes.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.589
I mean, you don't have to be an expert.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.292
And what are these?

13:39.432 --> 13:39.993
Can you tell me?

13:40.013 --> 13:42.876
A lithography of scenes from Persshire.

13:43.649 --> 13:53.024
Sketches of scenery in Perthshire, P-E-I-T-H-S-H-I-R-E, drawn from nature and on stone, which means lithography, by D.O.

13:53.084 --> 13:54.927
Hill, H-I-L-L.

13:55.408 --> 14:01.738
Published by the Hill Great Street, Perth.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.419
It's in that.

14:02.439 --> 14:04.422
It's in my green border.

14:04.442 --> 14:05.584
But you see this here?

14:05.604 --> 14:07.747
It just keeps going like that.

14:07.767 --> 14:08.188
I love these.

14:10.447 --> 14:12.530
They're lithographs.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.794
They're early lithographs.

14:14.814 --> 14:15.956
1810, 1820.

14:15.976 --> 14:17.399
That's really wonderful.

14:19.242 --> 14:20.323
I got more like that.

14:20.824 --> 14:25.211
I mean, it would take about six to eight hours to go through.

14:25.272 --> 14:25.953
How many?

14:26.353 --> 14:27.335
Six to eight.

14:27.355 --> 14:28.337
Six to eight.

14:28.357 --> 14:30.440
I mean, to really do it justice.

14:31.121 --> 14:37.011
And it's because... And I think there's too many of you sort of developed.

14:39.978 --> 14:43.503
It's a function of explaining.

14:43.523 --> 14:45.987
It's one thing.

14:46.107 --> 14:53.557
Here's another one.

14:53.578 --> 14:54.899
Here's a nice little landscape.

14:54.919 --> 14:58.044
Not an important piece, but they use a French map.

14:59.005 --> 15:03.912
So to define a focus for what you do, it's going to be hard, isn't it?

15:04.353 --> 15:05.074
Well, I don't know.

15:05.527 --> 15:08.310
About seven or eight different collections, maybe ten.

15:08.670 --> 15:11.293
I have the scenes, I may have the books and parts.

15:11.553 --> 15:20.823
I have a Dickens collection, a Thackeray collection, or defined as great 19th century novels.

15:21.184 --> 15:25.428
I have an early 19th, 1850 or earlier.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.750
Is that a first Pepys diary?

15:27.170 --> 15:27.671
Yes.

15:27.691 --> 15:28.151
That's nice.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.213
I got a second Pepys diary this summer.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.234
I was very happy to get it.

15:32.155 --> 15:34.538
Because I write about Mr. Pepys as your own book.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.629
That's nice, yeah.

15:37.110 --> 15:41.937
I held the actual diary it is at the library, which I described in the book.

15:42.017 --> 15:44.421
I have the actual one that he wrote.

15:44.501 --> 15:44.861
Oh, yeah.

15:45.262 --> 15:49.108
I have a Rockwell Kent collection of all his manuscripts.

15:49.969 --> 15:51.852
Gene O'Neill, modern author.

15:51.872 --> 15:52.673
Now, why O'Neill?

15:52.693 --> 15:53.434
I have this set.

15:54.335 --> 15:54.576
Why?

15:54.676 --> 15:59.263
Because I think he's the greatest playwright of the 20th century, American playwright.

15:59.283 --> 16:02.247
Consistent, you know...

16:03.053 --> 16:06.317
Tennessee Williams had some greater pieces, but not consistency.

16:06.517 --> 16:09.460
I love Tennessee Williams, I'm pleased to say.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.942
Okay.

16:10.962 --> 16:11.242
Not bad.

16:11.963 --> 16:12.524
Not bad.

16:12.544 --> 16:15.847
For no means.

16:16.208 --> 16:21.934
I have the most exquisite copy of Streetcar and of The Glass Menagerie.

16:22.054 --> 16:23.496
They make you cry to see them.

16:23.896 --> 16:27.340
The one thing I have of Williams, I have his first play ever published.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.008
That's in paper.

16:29.288 --> 16:29.829
Right.

16:29.890 --> 16:30.872
I have that, too.

16:30.892 --> 16:31.753
Band of Angels.

16:32.234 --> 16:32.355
Yes.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.557
I paid a lot of money for mine.

16:33.577 --> 16:38.467
$450, exactly, as a matter of fact, from the Blombers.

16:39.069 --> 16:39.510
Right.

16:39.530 --> 16:40.472
I know the copy.

16:40.492 --> 16:40.692
Yeah.

16:41.013 --> 16:41.915
Do you?

16:41.935 --> 16:42.075
Mm-hmm.

16:42.095 --> 16:42.816
So I have that.

16:43.117 --> 16:45.282
That's a good... You got a good price on it.

16:45.302 --> 16:45.402
Okay.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.003
Because I paid $400...

16:46.473 --> 16:47.114
In 1980.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.079
Well, this was eight or nine years ago that I bought it.

16:52.099 --> 16:53.600
They've done very well for themselves.

16:53.620 --> 16:54.061
They have.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.683
But they're good, though.

16:58.045 --> 16:58.945
They've been here.

16:58.965 --> 16:59.706
David stayed here.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.510
But then they're exceedingly knowledgeable people.

17:03.790 --> 17:08.735
So I have a Beat Generation collection that does 10,000 pages of manuscript.

17:09.336 --> 17:10.817
So that's a manuscript collection.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.560
It's the Beat Generation collection.

17:13.878 --> 17:14.839
VV generation.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.781
Important collection in private hands.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.925
So what happens to that then if it has such archival significance?

17:20.945 --> 17:23.047
Well, it's the original Naked Lunch Man.

17:23.087 --> 17:24.809
What happens to it in your view?

17:24.829 --> 17:29.733
It eventually finds its way to a library.

17:29.753 --> 17:30.234
Okay.

17:30.374 --> 17:35.959
Have you given any thought as to, you know, I mean, for instance, Stanford has a huge beat collection.

17:35.979 --> 17:36.099
Right.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.241
I talked to them.

17:37.481 --> 17:39.763
To Mike Keller, right?

17:39.783 --> 17:40.143
Right.

17:40.163 --> 17:42.906
They had to decide whether they bought the

17:43.105 --> 17:46.468
for a million bucks, too.

17:46.808 --> 17:48.149
I didn't think they paid quite that much.

17:48.249 --> 17:51.512
Well, the announced figure was a million, and they haven't denied it.

17:52.733 --> 18:01.521
I think they paid a little less, but anyway, Andrew Wiley had a collection.

18:02.302 --> 18:03.583
You know, that collection's public.

18:03.603 --> 18:04.604
Everyone knows about that.

18:04.724 --> 18:07.426
I think it's too much money for Ginsburg.

18:08.647 --> 18:11.810
If he's worth a million, mine's worth a lot more.

18:11.830 --> 18:13.011
Yeah, I mean...

18:14.273 --> 18:18.679
I consider him, you know, I think the New Republic called him a major-minor poet.

18:19.059 --> 18:19.320
Right.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.182
That's what he is.

18:21.302 --> 18:21.923
That's what he is.

18:22.464 --> 18:22.944
Exactly.

18:24.086 --> 18:30.674
You know, you were joking earlier about who wants Grapes of Wrath and all this, but I noticed you've got some pretty nice stuff.

18:30.835 --> 18:32.056
You do have Grapes of Wrath.

18:32.857 --> 18:34.499
What do you think of that one?

18:35.321 --> 18:38.665
I'll tell you, I have one that's probably nicer.

18:38.825 --> 18:40.667
You're not going to believe this until I show it to you.

18:42.089 --> 18:42.610
The line is,

18:43.315 --> 18:44.376
clipped up there, too.

18:45.717 --> 18:46.278
It's wonderful.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.041
These and I wrote for like $3,500.

18:50.322 --> 18:50.902
Right.

18:52.324 --> 18:53.144
It's a wonderful one.

18:54.326 --> 18:56.287
And then I got this one here.

18:56.307 --> 18:58.109
This is a unique copy.

18:58.129 --> 18:58.770
It's not the first.

18:58.790 --> 18:59.791
It's the first illustrator.

18:59.811 --> 19:00.792
Oh, I don't know this one.

19:02.073 --> 19:04.936
Look inside.

19:04.956 --> 19:06.938
Oh, wait.

19:07.418 --> 19:08.099
Oh, my.

19:08.759 --> 19:09.200
Okay.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.381
It's from Bill Todd.

19:11.122 --> 19:12.563
Very important.

19:13.387 --> 19:16.351
The guy who does a chronicle of the madness.

19:16.732 --> 19:18.174
He used to live in Cleveland.

19:18.194 --> 19:20.817
By John Steinbeck.

19:21.538 --> 19:31.993
Then, it's for Bill, and it's signed by Carl Van Doren, and the artist John... Well, that's well... He also did Hemingway stuff.

19:32.013 --> 19:33.856
That's pretty exceptional.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.139
Outstanding.

19:37.921 --> 19:39.744
Now, you can mute.

19:39.764 --> 19:40.525
That's okay.

19:41.365 --> 19:45.811
That's what's called trumping me.

19:45.831 --> 19:46.152
I don't need to.

19:46.172 --> 19:46.632
No, I love it.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.253
Are you kidding?

19:47.393 --> 19:48.174
I love it.

19:48.315 --> 19:51.299
Are you familiar with the Winnie the Pooh books?

19:51.319 --> 19:52.260
No, not those books.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.081
Have you ever seen them?

19:53.101 --> 19:53.982
I've seen them, but I do.

19:54.002 --> 19:56.225
Have you seen the copies?

19:56.245 --> 19:59.069
Would you want to see the most spectacular copies in existence?

19:59.089 --> 19:59.530
Of course.

20:02.554 --> 20:04.076
You don't want to sit in there.

20:06.860 --> 20:07.000
No, no.

20:07.020 --> 20:07.120
Okay.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.343
Now we are six by... Oh, my.

20:09.444 --> 20:09.824
That is.

20:10.124 --> 20:10.545
That's unbelievable.

20:11.251 --> 20:14.995
That's absolutely unbelievable, isn't it?

20:15.015 --> 20:17.778
What prompted you to buy Winnie the Pooh?

20:17.838 --> 20:20.260
Yeah, see, that's the only approach I knew.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.321
I knew without buying.

20:22.042 --> 20:25.886
It was available, and the price was right, right?

20:25.966 --> 20:26.947
Well, why do you hate this house?

20:26.967 --> 20:28.989
I mean, look at this.

20:29.009 --> 20:31.311
I just got a valuation from Glenn.

20:31.571 --> 20:31.852
10?

20:33.053 --> 20:33.293
Per.

20:33.313 --> 20:34.514
10.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.375
Is that a good guess?

20:35.395 --> 20:35.776
10?

20:35.796 --> 20:36.176
12.

20:37.297 --> 20:38.498
That's a good guess, though, isn't it?

20:38.518 --> 20:41.241
They had no idea, because there's nothing like it on the market.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.296
And we'd get 12, 10, 12, 15.

20:44.436 --> 20:48.884
And look at that.

20:48.904 --> 20:52.790
That is an outstanding button.

20:52.810 --> 20:53.331
New York.

20:56.537 --> 20:58.761
100 copies.

20:58.781 --> 20:59.622
Congratulations.

20:59.762 --> 21:06.494
I mean, they're normally, but they don't have the boxes with them.

21:06.514 --> 21:06.774
That's right.

21:06.794 --> 21:07.195
I'll put that one.

21:11.866 --> 21:14.829
I don't want to handle it no more.

21:15.690 --> 21:16.371
Look at that.

21:16.411 --> 21:17.311
I'm not going to open it up.

21:17.331 --> 21:18.693
No, I really don't want you.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.855
The glass scene is magnificent.

21:21.355 --> 21:22.397
Untouched.

21:22.557 --> 21:23.297
Untouched.

21:23.317 --> 21:25.940
And we're talking children's books, which are usually read to death.

21:26.240 --> 21:26.481
Right.

21:26.861 --> 21:28.022
Don't forget your plastic.

21:28.042 --> 21:29.223
No, don't worry.

21:31.586 --> 21:32.867
What was the title of that one again?

21:33.708 --> 21:34.549
Winning the Proof.

21:34.569 --> 21:37.011
Yeah, no, but there was that particular.

21:37.131 --> 21:38.353
That's Winning the Proof.

21:38.893 --> 21:40.194
Yeah, but it's a series.

21:40.254 --> 21:41.195
It's not the same title.

21:41.215 --> 21:41.856
No, Winning the Proof.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.697
Is it the same book as that one?

21:44.717 --> 21:44.978
No, no.

21:45.138 --> 21:45.959
Now we are six.

21:46.420 --> 21:46.860
Okay.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.302
That's Winnie the Pooh.

21:48.322 --> 21:48.903
That's the original.

21:49.103 --> 21:50.165
And what's the year on that one?

21:50.185 --> 21:50.826
Do you know offhand?

21:51.366 --> 21:51.447
No.

21:51.467 --> 21:52.228
Without opening up?

21:52.248 --> 21:52.668
Don't worry.

21:52.688 --> 21:53.109
We'll find it.

21:53.129 --> 21:53.790
We'll find it.

21:53.810 --> 21:54.931
That's easy.

21:54.951 --> 21:55.913
House of Pooh Corner.

21:58.376 --> 21:59.938
Did you get these all from the same source?

22:00.079 --> 22:00.259
Yes.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.023
Look at that.

22:03.043 --> 22:04.164
House of Pooh Corner.

22:05.987 --> 22:06.728
Magnificent.

22:07.229 --> 22:12.255
And you see they knew... This is when he came to your house?

22:12.536 --> 22:12.636
Yeah.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.409
Even a couple of weeks ago.

22:18.474 --> 22:19.435
How long have you had them?

22:20.477 --> 22:23.562
About 10 years, 12, 14 years.

22:23.582 --> 22:26.227
No one knows I have these, except people come.

22:26.247 --> 22:28.551
They came from the U.S.?

22:28.571 --> 22:32.638
No, they came from a bakery in Baltimore.

22:32.698 --> 22:39.349
They were in a vault, and some guy went there to liquidate the inventory and found these books and some others.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.264
that we bought.

22:42.324 --> 22:44.006
He came to Cleveland.

22:44.026 --> 22:51.779
He had one edition club books, and these books, standing by the dealer, and he saw by them, and he said, how much?

22:52.580 --> 22:53.581
And I threw out the number.

22:53.621 --> 22:55.004
And he took it.

22:55.024 --> 22:55.244
What?

22:55.484 --> 22:58.489
And he took it.

22:58.509 --> 22:59.230
He smiled.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.153
Let the record show that you're smiling.

23:02.776 --> 23:03.777
It was remarkable.

23:04.679 --> 23:06.822
It was probably the best thing ever.

23:07.544 --> 23:09.246
Oh, that's wonderful.

23:09.626 --> 23:12.309
Do you know how they got into that vault?

23:12.509 --> 23:13.329
We don't know, right?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.110
I could trace it.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.932
I got some letters.

23:16.052 --> 23:17.814
Wouldn't you want to know?

23:17.974 --> 23:20.336
I do and I don't.

23:20.496 --> 23:21.717
What are they now?

23:21.878 --> 23:22.598
Three books here?

23:22.839 --> 23:23.079
Four.

23:23.539 --> 23:24.800
Complete set.

23:24.921 --> 23:26.322
So what were the four titles?

23:27.103 --> 23:27.843
Winnie the Pooh.

23:28.204 --> 23:30.626
The House at Pooh Corner.

23:31.166 --> 23:32.127
Now we are six.

23:32.848 --> 23:33.889
Okay, how do you get the fourth one?

23:35.978 --> 23:37.180
When we were very young.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.722
Okay, when we were very young.

23:40.104 --> 23:42.247
They came out of a safe in Baltimore.

23:42.969 --> 23:43.309
Right.

23:43.329 --> 23:44.090
From a bakery.

23:46.153 --> 23:46.394
Right.

23:46.674 --> 23:47.756
That's a great story.

23:48.277 --> 23:49.599
And I'm just standing there.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.041
And how did you run across them?

23:51.061 --> 23:52.924
I'm standing in a book dealer by his desk.

23:54.786 --> 23:56.449
A guy came in.

23:56.809 --> 23:58.091
A guy came in.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.674
So the guy made the deal with you?

23:59.994 --> 24:03.299
Well, I gave the book dealer commission, of course.

24:04.281 --> 24:05.142
I wasn't able to do it.

24:06.792 --> 24:10.337
The dealer would delight to make a few bucks quicker.

24:10.417 --> 24:12.941
If the dealer was smart, he would have bought the books.

24:13.602 --> 24:16.186
Um, it had been hard because I was standing there.

24:17.728 --> 24:19.310
Except that the guy went to the dealer.

24:19.390 --> 24:20.912
I mean, the dealer could make a claim.

24:21.173 --> 24:21.493
I know.

24:22.274 --> 24:24.918
This is my wife.

24:24.938 --> 24:25.279
Hello.

24:25.759 --> 24:25.940
Hi.

24:26.721 --> 24:27.883
I'm having great fun.

24:28.584 --> 24:28.844
How are you?

24:28.864 --> 24:30.186
Yes, Nick Rasgames.

24:30.206 --> 24:31.207
And Donna.

24:31.267 --> 24:31.628
Hi Donna.

24:31.648 --> 24:32.109
Nice to meet you.

24:32.129 --> 24:33.751
Thank you for having me in your home.

24:35.213 --> 24:36.395
It's a great honor to be here.

24:36.415 --> 24:36.495
Hey.

24:37.150 --> 24:47.422
When I write, I still write with reason.

24:47.442 --> 24:57.433
It isn't that I can't type, which I do and I do at times, but it's the energy that comes from the brain and it's a good process.

24:59.315 --> 25:03.360
That's how I relate.

25:03.982 --> 25:06.084
Now, that's not true for everyone.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.906
I write on word processes, for instance.

25:07.926 --> 25:08.747
Yeah.

25:08.827 --> 25:10.829
I mean, but I grew up that way.

25:11.570 --> 25:12.671
I never thought I could do it.

25:12.971 --> 25:20.699
But I have to say, flying in, I fill these notebooks with things, and it's my best writing, these notebooks, for some reason.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.304
Today, when I was in your office, I was going through that notebook.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.947
Boy, that's some really good stuff in here.

25:28.214 --> 25:31.718
You have to write it down right away until you lose it.

25:31.738 --> 25:38.865
Some nice little images that, boy, if you don't get them down, they're gone forever and it's too bad.

25:41.688 --> 25:47.434
Anyway, now on the other hand, I love to read books.

25:47.454 --> 25:49.836
I also love to hear books on tape.

25:50.617 --> 25:55.362
And most, many of the books in the 19th century were meant to be rather spoken.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.664
And there's a poetry to

25:58.150 --> 26:00.032
or the way they're sound.

26:00.773 --> 26:03.295
Who was the greatest book reader of the 19th century?

26:03.836 --> 26:04.437
Dickens.

26:04.457 --> 26:04.697
Dickens.

26:05.277 --> 26:05.778
By far.

26:05.958 --> 26:06.719
Oh, yeah.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.020
No, he was the book.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.722
He would read his book on stage.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.363
Yeah.

26:10.423 --> 26:11.824
That's his factory.

26:12.945 --> 26:15.108
But Dickens was the master.

26:15.148 --> 26:16.789
Who wanted to be an actor?

26:16.929 --> 26:18.051
Is that right?

26:18.231 --> 26:18.411
Yeah.

26:18.791 --> 26:20.713
He wrote plays and he acted.

26:21.094 --> 26:25.238
He and Wilkie Collins used to act in their plays.

26:25.842 --> 26:30.247
He was a failed actor, failed playwright.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.452
That is interesting, though, when it comes to writing for parts, though, doesn't it?

26:34.692 --> 26:35.833
Yes.

26:35.853 --> 26:40.499
Because there is a dramatic element there, don't you think?

26:40.879 --> 26:42.701
That's why I like the parts.

26:42.721 --> 26:47.146
I mean, you know, to me, it's a fascination.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.469
It's a combination of the funds.

26:49.489 --> 26:53.574
And the fact that these are so fragile, these parts, they're meant to be read.

26:53.594 --> 26:54.735
They weren't meant to be collected.

26:55.154 --> 26:57.456
You think they were meant to be ephemeral, too, probably.

26:57.997 --> 27:05.424
Well, they were, because they combined them, and they would sell them, you know, books in parts were also an attempt to beat the stamp of taxes.

27:06.344 --> 27:11.569
They had a shilling tax on most of their sold for over a certain amount, but it was a purely marketing device.

27:12.550 --> 27:15.993
But it shaped the very structure of how these writers wrote.

27:16.013 --> 27:23.220
I mean, you could say Hardy and even Henry James wrote serially, but they wrote for magazines.

27:23.723 --> 27:25.285
And so they enticed the readers.

27:25.505 --> 27:28.788
I had them not to collect magazines because it's just overwhelming.

27:28.808 --> 27:32.613
The concept of one working totally better.

27:33.714 --> 27:38.679
So let me ask you, do you strive for completeness?

27:38.759 --> 27:44.766
I mean, when you get into Dickens, is it necessary for you to try and get every book that you ever did in parts?

27:45.246 --> 27:46.567
Well, I have them all.

27:46.588 --> 27:47.508
You do, so you have them all.

27:47.589 --> 27:48.550
Except one.

27:48.570 --> 27:49.350
Which is that?

27:49.391 --> 27:52.354
Sketches by Bob, which I tried once.

27:52.394 --> 27:53.595
It's only been on the market once.

27:53.930 --> 27:55.532
Is that the toughest one?

27:55.552 --> 27:57.955
That's, for me, it's the toughest one.

27:57.975 --> 28:04.564
And it is the toughest one to, the second toughest one.

28:05.445 --> 28:12.214
The first toughest is a pick with papers, a perfect pick with papers.

28:12.234 --> 28:14.637
And that's, there's only five or six copies in the world.

28:15.198 --> 28:16.419
Right.

28:16.439 --> 28:17.260
Is that one?

28:17.280 --> 28:17.501
No.

28:18.061 --> 28:23.228
They have about like 95 points, which collates means that they have certain advertisements and

28:23.815 --> 28:29.421
And I think our copy has 72 points out of 95.

28:29.701 --> 28:32.163
I sit down and check them off.

28:33.084 --> 28:34.326
So it doesn't count then?

28:34.486 --> 28:35.046
Oh, it counts.

28:35.086 --> 28:36.448
My book is valuable.

28:37.228 --> 28:38.870
But there's only five in the world.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.332
They have all 95 points.

28:40.352 --> 28:40.632
Right.

28:41.313 --> 28:43.755
And the value of those books would be infinite.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.320
So they were making corrections as they were going along.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.763
Well, printers would insert different advertisements.

28:52.250 --> 29:01.142
or because the popularity would be different states, and some of the plates would be dark plates because they would have to re-etch them.

29:01.923 --> 29:04.747
Oh, the world has collated this whole thing to figure it out.

29:05.007 --> 29:05.788
Oh, yeah, I loved it.

29:06.349 --> 29:11.035
I mean, I don't do it now because I have them, but I've collated all my books.

29:11.055 --> 29:11.456
You have?

29:11.696 --> 29:14.360
Oh, yeah, sure.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.082
I do my own collation.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.886
So completeness is very important.

29:19.086 --> 29:20.468
I only have one book.

29:21.089 --> 29:22.812
Out of thousands, that's incomplete.

29:22.972 --> 29:31.966
And I know I'll never find the first page or first chapter, so I bought a set that's missing one.

29:32.066 --> 29:32.947
What book is there?

29:33.808 --> 29:36.072
The Mysteries of Paris by Eugene Sue.

29:37.013 --> 29:41.019
It's possible to find an incomplete set, but I didn't... I don't know the book.

29:41.079 --> 29:41.300
What?

29:41.460 --> 29:43.383
I don't know the book.

29:44.104 --> 29:49.392
He wrote The Wandering Jew and Mysteries of Paris and the Orphans.

29:50.435 --> 29:52.700
He's a Frenchman.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.642
News to me.

29:53.662 --> 29:53.963
What?

29:54.323 --> 29:56.648
I mean, I don't know him.

29:57.069 --> 29:57.350
Okay.

29:57.410 --> 29:58.753
Why is he so important to you?

29:59.815 --> 30:02.902
Actually, there's an emotional reason for that.

30:04.245 --> 30:05.207
Of course, back to my mother.

30:05.768 --> 30:07.752
There's always a reason, isn't there?

30:07.772 --> 30:10.097
I'm the first to admit, but I'm not...

30:15.747 --> 30:17.950
This is not the one in a Jew.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.371
This is Mysteries of Paris.

30:19.391 --> 30:19.672
Yeah.

30:19.712 --> 30:23.536
See, I have Pat, I'm missing page, part, part, push, part.

30:25.058 --> 30:29.784
And it's impossible because it wasn't a popular book, and therefore it wasn't collected.

30:30.985 --> 30:33.628
So we interfered at Boston.

30:34.009 --> 30:34.990
They gave it a deal.

30:35.130 --> 30:35.991
They gave it a deal.

30:36.952 --> 30:40.056
I can even tell you, they paid a couple hundred dollars.

30:40.076 --> 30:43.560
I think where I got it, and I was willing to pay

30:43.844 --> 30:48.749
But even though it's in part one, it's missing.

30:48.809 --> 30:49.470
Someday I'll find it.

30:49.570 --> 30:52.854
If I find it, I'll find it.

30:52.994 --> 31:00.182
But I knew that was it.

31:00.862 --> 31:06.168
This is a wandering Jew in book form.

31:06.188 --> 31:07.890
I can't find it in parts.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.593
It did come out in parts.

31:11.013 --> 31:12.154
Wow.

31:13.636 --> 31:13.716
Wow.

31:16.126 --> 31:20.854
Wandering Jew was a famous French book of the 1840s.

31:21.555 --> 31:23.879
This obviously isn't into the English tradition.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.642
Oh, that's all I could find.

31:25.682 --> 31:34.497
The French tend to bound to find all their books in red bindings, and so you rarely find them in the original.

31:34.517 --> 31:35.619
This is usually the paper.

31:41.309 --> 31:41.509
Very nice.

31:42.755 --> 31:44.517
So what's the story about your mother?

31:44.537 --> 31:46.839
You said it has to do with your mother?

31:46.859 --> 31:46.999
Oh.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.862
As a child, she had three.

31:49.882 --> 31:53.405
That was my grandmother, my mother and Harriet.

31:53.926 --> 31:57.269
She had three sets of books that I lived with all my life.

31:57.529 --> 31:58.290
I mean, as a child.

31:58.930 --> 32:06.818
One was the red volumes of a set of Stevenson, another one of Mark Twain, and The Wandering Room.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.542
And it just was built when I was two and three and four.

32:10.602 --> 32:11.422
My grandmother had them.

32:11.442 --> 32:12.103
My mother had them.

32:12.455 --> 32:20.967
I never read the book, and they were on the shelves, and I just... So it was a residence, it was kind of an LBI, I guess.

32:21.027 --> 32:23.290
Right, an echoing to my childhood.

32:23.991 --> 32:32.362
You said something earlier today about books that you raised as a kid that you threw away the desk jackets for, like you wanted to go back and get them, is that right?

32:32.983 --> 32:42.276
Yeah, but as a young adult, we used to, you know, I had someone here that threw away, he was just reading books over there, and...

32:43.910 --> 32:57.603
I gave the idea that my book, my article started, you know, one day my wife was pushing me to throw out my books, give away my books, I went to the basement and I saw, you know, that was just a big habit.

32:57.623 --> 33:00.786
You probably should wind up throwing away too, right?

33:00.826 --> 33:12.837
When I, my wife said we have to cull, I love it when we cull, you know, our 20,000 books you might find so effective when I can fart with, and even those that give you separation anxiety,

33:13.323 --> 33:16.688
You know, I never read them again, but they represent as a time in my life.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.973
And I remember what, you know, I try to justify it.

33:20.073 --> 33:21.775
It's very hardship.

33:21.795 --> 33:27.524
You know, there was a guy, a physician, who came to my signing in San Francisco at the ILAB.

33:27.564 --> 33:28.765
That's a young guy.

33:28.785 --> 33:31.229
Well, he's younger than me, which makes him young.

33:31.469 --> 33:33.011
That's what I'm concerned.

33:33.032 --> 33:39.801
And his collection was, he wanted to go back and get copies of the books that he loved reading growing up that influenced him.

33:40.442 --> 33:42.385
And he didn't necessarily have to be first.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.991
you know, but they had to be good editions as close.

33:46.351 --> 33:51.637
And that was his collection, books that resonated from his childhood and through his forward years.

33:51.657 --> 33:52.418
It's a good collection.

33:52.458 --> 33:54.540
I thought, that's a nice, I said, that's a wonderful collection.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.701
I said, that's a nice collection.

33:55.741 --> 33:57.443
And he said, I don't have to spend a lot of money on it.

33:57.984 --> 33:59.846
I just, I just want to get the books.

34:00.046 --> 34:02.949
See, the difference is, but again, it's a reader's collection.

34:03.049 --> 34:04.411
Yeah, why do I read?

34:04.571 --> 34:07.914
But I have books from childhood, some of those.

34:07.934 --> 34:08.195
Sure.

34:08.595 --> 34:10.397
And some are in the basement, and some,

34:10.799 --> 34:19.932
I find it's easier to give away, which isn't fascinating, I find it easier to give away recent readings than the ones from childhood.

34:19.952 --> 34:20.593
I think that's true.

34:20.613 --> 34:24.198
There's a woman who wrote a book, Lynn Sharon Schwartz, who wrote Ruin by Reading.

34:24.218 --> 34:25.079
Have you heard about that book?

34:25.099 --> 34:25.480
No.

34:25.800 --> 34:30.847
There are three books out right at the same time I'm reading, what I'm reviewing that I finished in your office today.

34:31.508 --> 34:37.296
Another one called Ruin by Reading, and then this other one is Great Books, with this guy David Denby,

34:37.681 --> 34:38.862
He's my age.

34:39.443 --> 34:44.889
He's a film critic and he went back to Columbia to read the book.

34:44.929 --> 34:45.530
That's right.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.512
Again, it's about the Western canon.

34:47.532 --> 34:48.754
It's about the great books.

34:48.954 --> 34:49.975
Are they still relevant?

34:50.536 --> 34:52.919
I'm going to be on a panel with him in Miami next month.

34:53.519 --> 34:57.844
In fact, these three people who wrote books about reading in my book should be interesting.

34:58.545 --> 34:59.827
Who's that panel for?

35:00.448 --> 35:04.753
It's the Miami Book Fair, which is a new book fair.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.034
It's a great

35:06.284 --> 35:07.225
It's not rare books.

35:07.245 --> 35:07.866
It's new books.

35:07.886 --> 35:10.450
No, but it's a nice... Everybody goes to it.

35:10.550 --> 35:14.055
They must bring in 50 off.

35:14.195 --> 35:18.201
It's a very prestigious... Do you get paid for that?

35:18.281 --> 35:24.410
You don't get paid for that, but your publishers... You're pleased to go because... Well, the publisher sells books.

35:25.051 --> 35:29.518
The publisher sells books, but it does get some ink, and it's nice to be invited.

35:29.538 --> 35:34.705
Yeah, and your name is out there for... Yeah, no, that one you're pleased to go to, Ratham.

35:35.917 --> 35:40.943
Well, books of childhood have, you know, memories for both of us.

35:40.963 --> 35:43.667
I know Donna talks about, has talked about.

35:44.928 --> 35:48.613
I am going to excuse myself because I wake up tomorrow at 5.30.

35:49.094 --> 35:50.355
And I think we'll follow with you.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.919
No, well, I'm not trying to.

35:52.939 --> 35:54.481
How was your meeting tonight?

35:54.541 --> 35:55.482
We moved along.

35:55.522 --> 35:57.825
We did what we were supposed to do.

35:57.845 --> 36:00.388
So, Donna, just before you go to bed, do you share this passion?

36:01.128 --> 36:02.630
Do I share the passion?

36:03.331 --> 36:05.353
I approve the passion.

36:05.513 --> 36:11.381
I don't... I have my other passion more than... Well, I approve it.

36:11.401 --> 36:12.282
That's good.

36:12.302 --> 36:13.663
That's a perfect answer.

36:13.683 --> 36:14.424
Yeah.

36:15.185 --> 36:24.917
Donna is extraordinarily patient and supportive.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.544
You know, we have to be careful, but we go into bookstores, wherever,

36:31.148 --> 36:57.409
wide or inferred limits but she's been very uh sort of probably you know not always with a smile i'm laughing because i you know my wife is kind of i mean i think i've infected her with this you know this disease she used to look at me at the same kind of eye about i don't believe but lately we'll go she would have to have this you know she loves these old spirit books very

36:58.891 --> 37:00.353
Madonna's a good collector.

37:00.373 --> 37:02.855
I mean, I collect a lot of stuff.

37:02.956 --> 37:03.456
I see that.

37:03.536 --> 37:07.601
I said to Paul Barola, I said, I love all this stuff.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.184
I collect a lot of stuff.

37:10.224 --> 37:11.405
He said, stuff.

37:11.425 --> 37:12.526
And we love stuff.

37:12.546 --> 37:16.691
I mean, that's, by the way, that's a Tibetan manuscript table.

37:16.711 --> 37:17.252
Right there?

37:17.272 --> 37:17.572
Yeah.

37:17.592 --> 37:18.773
Well, that's really cool.

37:18.793 --> 37:19.935
We got that over in Nepal.

37:20.395 --> 37:21.837
Yeah.

37:22.137 --> 37:23.379
But I thought we were the country.

37:23.519 --> 37:24.500
We were amazed.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.502
Well, we...

37:26.633 --> 37:28.055
It was a long time ago.

37:28.155 --> 37:30.178
It was a long time ago.

37:30.298 --> 37:35.045
How old is that, would you say?

37:35.065 --> 37:37.308
The spring century.

37:37.368 --> 37:38.229
That's not that old.

37:38.410 --> 37:39.852
It looks older than it probably is.

37:39.872 --> 37:43.116
I don't think it's more than 100 years old.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.098
I mean, that's my guess.

37:46.040 --> 37:51.568
I mean, I... But the ones you're talking about are ancient, right?

37:51.829 --> 37:53.571
The ones in the temples.

37:53.751 --> 37:54.833
Oh, yeah.

37:54.853 --> 37:54.953
Yeah.

37:55.220 --> 38:00.127
What Nick is doing is opening his book chapter about libraries around the world.

38:00.969 --> 38:03.773
And he mentioned a few... A critical place to history.

38:04.053 --> 38:06.036
And then I said, oh, you've got to talk about Ephesus.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.279
Well, I'm opening the book.

38:08.299 --> 38:09.301
Which is the opening.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.945
And we went there, my wife and I, 20 years ago.

38:12.325 --> 38:14.388
And then I said, suggested... We did too?

38:15.129 --> 38:15.230
Yeah.

38:15.350 --> 38:21.138
The Tibetan, the temples in Tibet, because manuscripts along the walls, try to buy one.

38:21.158 --> 38:22.240
They didn't work, they didn't work.

38:23.772 --> 38:30.800
I tried to ride a gable from a house in New Guinea once, and the boat's ready to leave, and I'm trying to negotiate with these people.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.863
I said, I've got to buy it.

38:33.883 --> 38:35.785
And the boat's saying, come on, you've got to go.

38:36.266 --> 38:36.907
And I'm torn.

38:36.927 --> 38:37.828
What do I do?

38:37.888 --> 38:40.370
And I finally left.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.972
You look pretty tired yourself.

38:42.473 --> 38:42.793
No, I'm.

38:43.434 --> 38:44.355
What time is it, I bet?

38:44.375 --> 38:44.775
It's 11.30.

38:45.796 --> 38:47.038
Another 10 minutes or so.

38:47.378 --> 38:50.001
Well, I'm going to go and let you finish up.

38:50.021 --> 38:51.062
I'll see you upstairs.

38:51.363 --> 38:51.703
Go ahead.

38:52.072 --> 38:53.293
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

38:53.433 --> 38:53.754
I'll be up.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.457
Do you do coffee in the morning?

38:57.477 --> 38:58.158
I do coffee.

38:58.778 --> 38:59.699
Okay.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.341
I love coffee in the morning.

39:01.361 --> 39:02.222
Do you love coffee?

39:02.242 --> 39:02.802
That's really all I need.

39:03.283 --> 39:04.684
That's all you need in the morning.

39:04.704 --> 39:05.605
That's all I need.

39:05.625 --> 39:08.348
Okay, I will try to make a pot before I leave.

39:08.468 --> 39:09.609
Don't worry about it.

39:09.629 --> 39:11.651
It's not you will, but I'll be back.

39:12.271 --> 39:13.312
Lots of worries.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.834
If there's coffee, I'll enjoy it.

39:14.854 --> 39:16.716
I'll be back by a quarter to eight.

39:17.917 --> 39:20.239
I didn't even be up at that time.

39:20.489 --> 39:23.412
Okay, and I like a lot of coffee in the morning, too.

39:23.692 --> 39:24.333
Excellent.

39:24.773 --> 39:25.174
Okay.

39:25.314 --> 39:26.855
Do you take your coffee black?

39:26.875 --> 39:27.796
It's black.

39:27.816 --> 39:29.318
Ah, my kind of guy.

39:29.338 --> 39:29.858
Okay.

39:29.958 --> 39:33.402
If you're tired, I think we've got a good start.

39:33.482 --> 39:37.646
A better one of the freshers.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.428
I like to think about things.

39:39.448 --> 39:40.389
I like to shoot some pictures.

39:40.909 --> 39:41.230
Sure.

39:42.451 --> 39:46.175
No, and I'll show you the pictures of my exhibition here if I can find them.

39:48.056 --> 39:48.657
Which I've heard.

39:48.856 --> 39:52.240
Obviously, I thought it really came out well.

39:52.260 --> 39:53.461
That's quite an honor, really.

39:54.242 --> 39:59.688
And you did mention, which we don't have on tape, that you had two exhibitions going on simultaneously in New York.

40:00.349 --> 40:02.050
And I know about the one at the Grosier.

40:02.150 --> 40:02.851
What was the other one?

40:03.232 --> 40:04.934
It was called The Beat Culture.

40:05.494 --> 40:06.075
Beat?

40:06.375 --> 40:07.616
Beat, B-A-T.

40:08.297 --> 40:09.458
And its influence.

40:09.478 --> 40:17.327
And it was a show at the Whitney showing that Burroughs and Kerouac and Ginsberg were fundamentally influential.

40:17.678 --> 40:37.423
with Jackson Pollock and Rauschenberg and all the other painters at the time, and I lent them part of the Naked Lunch manuscript, and they put a whole section of the show as my material in the middle of the room, and so it was very nice.

40:37.503 --> 40:46.555
It's still in San Francisco down at the Dion, but the pleasure I had was the fact that I had two exhibitions, one solo and one part,

40:47.429 --> 40:49.711
Was there a catalog for the other one?

40:49.811 --> 40:50.932
Oh, yeah, sure.

40:50.952 --> 40:52.714
You know, there were 200,000 people.

40:52.734 --> 40:54.836
200,000 people came to that show.

40:54.856 --> 40:54.956
Jeez.

40:56.057 --> 41:09.490
And the Grow Your Club catalog, the Grow Your... I am told by the Grow Your Club remarking that my show there was one of the most successful, if not the most successful in terms of attendance, Boyer.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.872
And the Boyer had wonderful coverage of the time.

41:11.952 --> 41:16.356
So I had the Time, you know, magazine article, and...

41:16.741 --> 41:18.504
The beat shell was covered around the world.

41:19.405 --> 41:24.653
I am one of a number of contributors, but I'm not trying to suggest that.

41:25.074 --> 41:28.279
But to have two of them at the same time, I mean, it was bouncing from one to the other.

41:28.299 --> 41:29.320
I was having a great time.

41:29.961 --> 41:32.044
I mean, it was something I created.

41:32.085 --> 41:32.986
You're swirling here.

41:33.106 --> 41:41.078
Yeah, we had a good... Well, you collect, satisfy yourself, but then also when you see this extension, I guess.

41:41.579 --> 41:41.880
Yeah.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.465
I love to talk, and then what I did was create a...

41:45.935 --> 41:48.778
Another talk at Groyer where I brought in a speaker.

41:48.838 --> 41:56.147
I found a speaker who could talk on cellular publications, which is now a big hot topic in the academic world.

41:56.167 --> 41:58.650
There's some books written on it.

41:59.070 --> 42:05.418
And I did a talk, a gallery talk, and then we had a dinner and had this guy talk.

42:06.058 --> 42:08.301
His talk wasn't quite as good as I had hoped.

42:09.282 --> 42:11.705
And John came in for that talk, too.

42:11.925 --> 42:13.427
I mean, he was very supportive of me.

42:14.335 --> 42:15.176
Did he come in?

42:15.256 --> 42:18.682
He came in for both the opening and for the talk.

42:19.623 --> 42:25.813
And he was suitably impressed that he is now hopeful of mounting his own.

42:26.133 --> 42:26.614
That's correct.

42:26.674 --> 42:27.515
Which I hope happens.

42:27.535 --> 42:28.116
That would be nice.

42:28.257 --> 42:29.619
I thought it is.

42:29.739 --> 42:30.961
You know, absolutely.

42:32.143 --> 42:33.905
Well, it's the next reason to go to New York.

42:35.247 --> 42:36.309
Yeah.

42:36.329 --> 42:40.976
I mean, I don't collect, you know, some collectors collect for glory.

42:41.637 --> 42:42.098
They want

42:43.124 --> 42:47.549
And there's a little bit of the ego that we all have.

42:48.570 --> 42:54.296
It's an extension of what I... It's a creative activity.

42:54.476 --> 42:55.077
For me it is.

42:55.738 --> 43:01.604
You know, it's not collecting Vulcan or Hemingway.

43:01.624 --> 43:02.325
It's easy.

43:02.405 --> 43:03.226
It's a no-brainer.

43:03.907 --> 43:08.572
So I like to shape something that takes a certain amount of connoisseurship.

43:08.632 --> 43:12.456
That's the difference between what I do and some other people.

43:13.448 --> 43:16.010
So finish that thought, some people collect for glory.

43:16.431 --> 43:27.240
They collect for glory, they collect for, um, points of, perhaps, intellectual snobbery, you know, I collect this, I collect that.

43:27.260 --> 43:32.544
Or the glitzy collectors, like Bill the Octopus, and, you know, Mark Himes, the books.

43:34.826 --> 43:37.288
His collectors are in Bel Air and Beverly Hills.

43:37.388 --> 43:40.611
Yeah, they're the entertainers of the world, you know.

43:40.651 --> 43:42.713
Or Lou Weinstein's being interior decorator.

43:43.435 --> 43:44.336
Who?

43:44.356 --> 43:47.701
It defends the... I said that sounds like interior decorators.

43:47.721 --> 43:48.061
Yeah, right.

43:48.201 --> 43:49.583
He says, what's wrong with that out here?

43:50.064 --> 43:53.188
Have you ever seen the money that interior decorators make out here?

43:53.228 --> 43:56.392
Yeah, so I mean, everyone has their own... You know, I respect that.

43:56.572 --> 43:58.575
Everyone has their motivation.

43:58.595 --> 44:06.706
I strove mightily to try and define myself because as you define what you collect, you define who you are and why you are what you are.

44:07.667 --> 44:10.391
Well, do you think what it's done is it's going to have a shape?

44:10.811 --> 44:11.012
No.

44:11.172 --> 44:11.232
No.

44:11.397 --> 44:15.482
Because there are apparently seven or eight disparate parts to it.

44:15.743 --> 44:17.185
Ten, maybe.

44:17.766 --> 44:21.531
But they just reflect various extensions of who I am.

44:21.551 --> 44:26.798
In other words, like John collects Lewis Carroll and fables.

44:27.318 --> 44:35.990
In a sense, one's an extension of the other because they both deal with fantasies and fables and morals.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.835
One was Lewis Carroll, but trying to teach...

44:40.507 --> 44:50.417
a couple of girls some moral stories, and being satirical, and fables have those same concepts.

44:51.718 --> 44:58.725
So you can say that they are not two separate collections, but they're, in a sense, part of the platonic whole.

45:00.287 --> 45:09.096
Mine are, and I realize that, I mean, it's easy with money to buy fancy books, but I tend to want

45:09.363 --> 45:13.909
sort of outgrow things that just purely I have a passion for.

45:14.910 --> 45:20.097
And some of the stuff I don't particularly like.

45:20.117 --> 45:24.322
I mean, early American fiction really isn't an exciting period.

45:24.342 --> 45:26.185
They're not very good writers in that period.

45:26.585 --> 45:31.752
But it's a niche area, and it's an area that, in America, they should be more conscious of.

45:31.772 --> 45:38.661
You know, what I collect, because they're cheap, and I can find a brick in a writer about books,

45:39.181 --> 45:43.709
Any books I can find are 19th century American literary criticism.

45:43.790 --> 45:45.533
Okay, that's a valid book.

45:45.894 --> 45:48.458
I just want to see what they were writing about the authors.

45:48.478 --> 45:50.462
You're actually collecting the authors themselves.

45:50.763 --> 45:51.063
Right.

45:51.684 --> 45:59.960
I mean, it amazes me that I cannot find a book published in Melville's lifetime that talks about Melville because he was totally unknown.

45:59.980 --> 46:00.882
He was disparaging.

46:00.902 --> 46:01.122
Right.

46:01.557 --> 46:02.999
You know, it's amazing to find.

46:03.239 --> 46:04.040
You won't find a book.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.162
You may find an article.

46:05.282 --> 46:06.163
Yeah, you might.

46:06.183 --> 46:10.770
But when you see these books about our great living authors, he's never there.

46:10.830 --> 46:12.773
They never regarded him as anybody.

46:13.353 --> 46:18.481
You have to come up to the 20s before he steps in to appear.

46:19.141 --> 46:22.346
I can find these for two and three and five and ten.

46:22.366 --> 46:27.413
You know, you can get satisfaction collecting at any level, which is what I... Who was it?

46:27.513 --> 46:28.915
Carl Van Vecten or...

46:29.485 --> 46:36.754
He's one of the promoters of a lot of the time with James.

46:36.774 --> 46:37.876
Yeah, it's not Van Vechten.

46:38.356 --> 46:39.117
I don't need me.

46:39.137 --> 46:41.160
Yeah, I mean, anyway, there's a whole period of that.

46:41.180 --> 46:42.601
Yeah, he's got about four of those books.

46:42.621 --> 46:44.604
The Powering of New England.

46:44.824 --> 46:45.285
New England.

46:45.425 --> 46:46.166
I got it over here.

46:46.186 --> 46:47.608
And I can't think of his name.

46:47.628 --> 46:48.649
It was Van something.

46:48.729 --> 46:50.271
I got the book over here or something.

46:50.291 --> 46:51.072
It's not Van Vechten.

46:51.693 --> 46:52.454
Maybe it is.

46:52.775 --> 46:58.663
I read heavily in criticism.

46:58.683 --> 46:59.564
I do too, I love it.

46:59.725 --> 47:08.477
I read quantum physics, and criticism, and literature, and natural history.

47:08.497 --> 47:19.674
And the one thing we've got to talk about tomorrow, you said that you're a philosophy major, and that you actually have that too much in your reading, and I think it's too late to get into it.

47:19.694 --> 47:20.274
I'm that person.

47:20.795 --> 47:21.396
I am.

47:21.764 --> 47:24.768
If you want to keep going, I really don't.

47:24.788 --> 47:25.369
I mean, I should.

47:25.790 --> 47:26.351
You're okay.

47:26.371 --> 47:27.132
I'm not just saying.

47:27.152 --> 47:29.435
I don't want to go to bed.

47:29.715 --> 47:30.136
No, no.

47:30.156 --> 47:31.498
It's just been a stressful.

47:31.618 --> 47:32.680
I think that we can.

47:33.581 --> 47:41.272
I mean, besides the orchestra, the imbalance of very heavy negotiations, they have business.

47:41.432 --> 47:42.854
What did you say?

47:43.495 --> 47:43.936
Searching.

47:44.076 --> 47:44.517
For what?

47:44.977 --> 47:48.362
Understanding what we're supposed to do.

47:48.815 --> 47:49.876
who we are.

47:49.896 --> 47:57.446
Well, I mean, certainly philosophically and in terms of literature, but also in terms of science and physics and all the other stuff.

47:57.786 --> 48:07.358
I mean, whether it's a terministic block, you know, and I, you know, it's not, it's kind of bleak when you come down to it.

48:07.378 --> 48:08.359
I love all this stuff.

48:08.379 --> 48:09.501
It's like going to a museum.

48:09.661 --> 48:15.508
These are, these are pre-Columbian that we dug up in Peru.

48:15.668 --> 48:17.651
You dug up personally?

48:17.691 --> 48:18.552
We personally dug up.

48:18.953 --> 48:24.160
Was this reconstructed or did it come out of the ground like that?

48:24.180 --> 48:27.785
No, it came out of the ground.

48:27.805 --> 48:30.949
Here, we'll show you more.

48:31.209 --> 48:31.310
Wow.

48:31.330 --> 48:32.832
We went on a date.

48:32.852 --> 48:34.213
How did you get this stuff out?

48:35.856 --> 48:37.478
I keep asking these questions.

48:37.698 --> 48:41.363
You've always been fascinated with signs?

48:41.503 --> 48:44.928
Signs and the meaning of symbolism.

48:44.948 --> 48:46.029
That's post-symbolic.

48:46.330 --> 48:48.192
Give me an example of what you're talking about.

48:48.332 --> 48:48.893
Well,

48:50.020 --> 48:53.583
Here, each one of these represents... And what are we looking at?

48:53.744 --> 48:54.704
This is Ethiopian.

48:54.885 --> 48:56.006
It's a scroll, right?

48:56.026 --> 48:56.706
A scroll, yeah.

48:57.027 --> 49:01.471
I do not, you know, and it's a religious scroll.

49:02.372 --> 49:03.573
And you got that in Ethiopia?

49:03.953 --> 49:06.155
No, we never were there, but I got it nearby.

49:07.316 --> 49:07.997
What's the language?

49:08.798 --> 49:09.298
Coptic.

49:09.318 --> 49:09.959
It's Coptic.

49:09.979 --> 49:11.020
I was going to say Coptic.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.661
I don't want to sound stupid.

49:13.142 --> 49:17.065
And what I do is I'll make, I'll write things down.

49:17.085 --> 49:19.808
I like to think how people wrote and why they wrote their signs.

49:20.446 --> 49:27.836
I sometimes copy Chinese symbols just because I'm just curious about them.

49:27.856 --> 49:28.857
You know, what makes English.

49:29.017 --> 49:30.599
What's this fabric?

49:31.220 --> 49:32.422
Is it that one, do you think?

49:32.442 --> 49:34.484
Is it a skin?

49:35.406 --> 49:36.427
I think it's a skin.

49:36.447 --> 49:36.988
I think it is.

49:37.008 --> 49:37.268
It is.

49:37.408 --> 49:38.089
There's no question.

49:38.109 --> 49:38.670
I'm pretty sure.

49:38.830 --> 49:41.273
It's the hair side, I think.

49:41.293 --> 49:42.455
The hair side is here.

49:42.475 --> 49:43.016
Oh, here.

49:45.219 --> 49:46.180
How old do you think it is?

49:47.822 --> 49:49.184
Have you ever tested if you really care?

49:49.204 --> 49:50.065
I really don't know.

49:50.483 --> 49:52.186
But it's somewhat old.

49:52.546 --> 49:54.129
You know, I would say 100.

49:54.249 --> 49:56.432
Only because they won't bother if it's new.

49:56.452 --> 49:57.213
It's too much work.

50:00.618 --> 50:03.743
And this is one of my most favorite.

50:06.507 --> 50:08.450
This is a Japanese encyclopedia.

50:08.711 --> 50:09.191
Jeez.

50:09.792 --> 50:10.634
That's very old.

50:10.834 --> 50:12.937
I just love this.

50:14.339 --> 50:17.945
Is that printed or is that printed?

50:17.965 --> 50:18.686
Isn't this wonderful?

50:18.906 --> 50:19.427
Yeah, it is.

50:21.432 --> 50:24.416
It's just a wonderful... Oh, I love this.

50:24.476 --> 50:25.077
I had no idea.

50:25.197 --> 50:25.417
What?

50:25.637 --> 50:27.179
Where'd you get that?

50:27.199 --> 50:28.781
From a dealer in Australia.

50:29.282 --> 50:30.183
You were in Australia?

50:30.363 --> 50:32.346
No, he comes to Cleveland to see me.

50:33.387 --> 50:37.352
And so you said you negotiated this with a caretaker at a cemetery, what is it again?

50:37.553 --> 50:37.973
Right, in Yemen.

50:38.414 --> 50:38.834
In Yemen.

50:39.315 --> 50:41.157
A cemetery in the desert?

50:41.678 --> 50:43.400
Well, are you familiar with the Empty Quarter?

50:43.821 --> 50:44.021
No.

50:44.301 --> 50:48.807
It's famous by Richard Burton and Weiziger and...

50:48.922 --> 50:49.303
T.E.

50:49.363 --> 50:53.208
Lawrence, and it's a part of the desert in Saudi Arabia Peninsula.

50:53.629 --> 50:57.855
It's called the Empty Quarter because for hundreds of miles, it's nothing but sand.

50:58.516 --> 51:01.260
And I always had a fantasy of crossing it.

51:02.101 --> 51:14.239
So one day at 5 in the morning, we got bodyguards, some soldiers with rifles, AKs, and we emptied the air out of our tires, and we crossed the desert.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.262
And it was

51:16.580 --> 51:19.323
some danger because they were still in the Civil War then again.

51:19.344 --> 51:20.205
And when was this?

51:20.225 --> 51:21.546
About two years ago.

51:21.566 --> 51:22.788
Oh, so this was 1984.

51:22.808 --> 51:23.669
1994.

51:26.893 --> 51:29.917
Now, three years ago, last year we were in Bolivia in 1993.

51:30.738 --> 51:33.982
Bolivia last year, Tibet the year before, and Yemen the year before that.

51:35.023 --> 51:43.054
And the next, we crossed the desert during the day in two cars, or two Land Rovers.

51:44.355 --> 51:45.777
It was very dangerous.

51:46.178 --> 51:51.643
And we got over there, and the next day we were driving in the desert, came to a little oasis.

51:51.663 --> 51:54.185
There was a cemetery there.

51:54.425 --> 51:57.548
And Muslim cemeteries are different than what we used to.

51:58.148 --> 52:03.133
And they had little buildings where they had mausoleons for saints, etc.

52:03.833 --> 52:06.316
So I went in there, looking around, I saw some books.

52:06.856 --> 52:08.798
Caretaker was there, negotiated, bought one.

52:10.259 --> 52:11.940
It took me about an hour to do it.

52:12.401 --> 52:14.262
Did it take that long?

52:14.282 --> 52:14.683
Always.

52:14.703 --> 52:16.084
I have a lot of money.

52:16.503 --> 52:16.823
What?

52:16.943 --> 52:17.884
He wanted a lot of money?

52:17.904 --> 52:19.325
Well, you know, $30.

52:19.486 --> 52:21.287
You know, I have a principal.

52:21.507 --> 52:25.210
You know, I don't know what I'm buying, so I just know I like it.

52:25.371 --> 52:28.373
You know, it can't be worth a lot.

52:28.393 --> 52:29.554
But I did something in Morocco.

52:29.574 --> 52:31.656
It took me three days to buy it.

52:31.676 --> 52:35.219
The first part of the Bible was done about 200 days ago.

52:35.639 --> 52:36.440
I have it in the other room.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.643
That's for tomorrow, perhaps.

52:41.484 --> 52:41.825
Good.

52:43.406 --> 52:45.868
Okay, we're talking to Bob Jackson on 8 October.

52:46.422 --> 52:57.538
that you've given stuff to... Well, I had it with my Virginia Woolf and Victoria Vita Sacro West collection at the Fales Library in New York.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.021
That's NYU.

53:00.121 --> 53:00.562
NYU.

53:01.463 --> 53:04.708
And it was a remarkable condition.

53:04.948 --> 53:10.076
It's not a deep collection in terms of manuscripts, but in terms of quality.

53:10.576 --> 53:14.382
But I stopped collecting them because there wasn't really anything else to collect there.

53:15.103 --> 53:16.024
And so I gave it to them.

53:16.763 --> 53:20.689
in my Burroughs, or small Burroughs archives in Arizona Burroughs.

53:21.651 --> 53:22.212
William Burroughs.

53:22.232 --> 53:26.939
Yeah, no, I just, what I'm transcribing, I have to... William Burroughs.

53:27.580 --> 53:31.746
And then, you know, I've given books in my Huxley collections at Oberlin.

53:32.988 --> 53:35.753
Okay, so what does this reflect on your part?

53:35.833 --> 53:41.702
I mean, are you picking these various institutions choices and deciding which collection goes where?

53:42.483 --> 53:44.847
The fails...

53:45.012 --> 53:52.422
It was a friend of mine named Brad Morrow, who's a writer and a book collect dealer.

53:52.442 --> 53:54.785
Yeah, he's written about three or four books.

53:54.925 --> 53:57.629
One, a book on Gothic tales.

53:58.430 --> 54:00.453
He teaches at Bard, I think.

54:00.473 --> 54:03.357
And he does a magazine called Conjunctions.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.342
Good morning.

54:08.504 --> 54:12.949
And he's a semi-annual magazine of new writing.

54:12.970 --> 54:13.450
Fresh Bagels.

54:13.650 --> 54:14.091
Oh, great.

54:15.455 --> 54:23.067
And he needed money for his magazine.

54:24.049 --> 54:27.254
So I said, well, I'm going to give my books to an institution.

54:27.274 --> 54:27.955
I don't care where.

54:27.975 --> 54:38.873
If you want to get a benefactor to appraise my books and give money to you, I'll give it to that particular institution to help you with your magazine.

54:38.973 --> 54:42.238
This is before he got a major distribution package.

54:43.045 --> 54:50.132
And so he found someone to give a lot of money to the university.

54:50.812 --> 55:00.241
They got my books, and he got the money from the university to help fund his magazine.

55:00.502 --> 55:01.523
This was some years ago.

55:02.283 --> 55:09.731
The Huxley went to Oberlin because I liked the people there, and I thought of Huck and Moffitt and Ray English, and that was simple.

55:09.891 --> 55:12.293
I mean, they don't have a great...

55:13.336 --> 55:15.719
And these are basic firsts that went there, right?

55:15.739 --> 55:17.581
Oh, yeah.

55:17.662 --> 55:20.065
Any papers or anything like that?

55:21.466 --> 55:22.167
No, that's true.

55:22.207 --> 55:30.518
The Huxley and the Wolf were strictly books.

55:32.401 --> 55:40.491
The original small archive that I had from Burroughs was his first short stories.

55:41.163 --> 55:52.034
a number of his novels in manuscript form, and they were sold and contributed to Arizona, someone actually through heritage.

55:52.054 --> 55:55.458
Bob, I want to mention that.

55:55.538 --> 56:01.043
So, I mean, they went there, so that's a major, that's a major repository.

56:01.564 --> 56:02.605
Which is?

56:02.625 --> 56:04.066
At Arizona State.

56:04.086 --> 56:05.027
Yeah, nothing down there.

56:05.548 --> 56:07.710
That's not where Larry Powell is, is it?

56:09.715 --> 56:12.379
Yeah, this is a Tempe in Phoenix.

56:12.719 --> 56:13.981
Oh, that's new, isn't it?

56:14.001 --> 56:14.962
Is that a new collection?

56:16.504 --> 56:18.086
Is that new or has that been around for a while?

56:18.346 --> 56:20.169
Mine down there is 83.

56:20.229 --> 56:22.372
Okay, no, there's another brand-new university.

56:22.392 --> 56:24.935
Oh, Arizona State's been there 50 years.

56:24.955 --> 56:26.377
There's another one that they just started.

56:26.537 --> 56:30.823
I met a guy in San Francisco who got their 60,000 books at Bookseller.

56:31.504 --> 56:31.964
Oh, no.

56:32.605 --> 56:33.987
And it's a brand-new campus.

56:35.910 --> 56:37.051
It wouldn't be going to Tempe.

56:37.652 --> 56:37.872
No.

56:37.972 --> 56:38.473
Santa Fe.

56:39.837 --> 56:42.260
That's New Mexico.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.382
Yeah, I have no idea.

56:43.402 --> 56:56.418
And then... I made coffee.

56:57.320 --> 57:02.887
And then I bought the other Brooks collection through Lichtenstein.

57:03.808 --> 57:05.490
That's another story.

57:07.428 --> 57:12.316
Did you tire of these books?

57:12.336 --> 57:12.937
No.

57:12.997 --> 57:14.820
What happens is you collect fully.

57:16.322 --> 57:20.729
And then I tired of it because there really wasn't much else to collect.

57:20.769 --> 57:23.273
There weren't important parts of it.

57:23.353 --> 57:30.364
I'm sorry about the Virginia Woolf, but there was a point that I ran out of space and I wanted to collect more.

57:30.785 --> 57:33.469
I just hadn't made a decision.

57:33.989 --> 57:36.353
Well, by the way, she was saying yesterday about Virginia Woolf.

57:36.433 --> 57:39.617
I am surprised that... Well, so is Donna.

57:41.540 --> 57:42.662
Donna didn't agree with you.

57:42.682 --> 57:46.728
I didn't agree with that.

57:46.748 --> 57:48.050
Better not probe that, right?

57:49.773 --> 57:54.740
The Hardsley and the Burroughs, she didn't have that same... Is that her statement?

57:56.182 --> 57:56.422
That's true.

57:56.442 --> 58:01.290
But the Virginia Woolf, you know, in order to do a good job, he had to go collect manuscripts.

58:01.310 --> 58:02.832
And...

58:08.279 --> 58:10.422
the passion, but you don't necessarily share.

58:10.442 --> 58:21.580
Well, that means, that means, uh, I, I, um, Bob is far more, um, knowledgeable than I am.

58:22.441 --> 58:28.350
And, um, I, I have so many other things that I collect.

58:30.113 --> 58:31.916
To satisfy the collecting passion.

58:32.016 --> 58:32.216
Right.

58:32.236 --> 58:36.042
I mean, oh, I have, I have the disease bad.

58:36.342 --> 58:37.383
But it's just not books.

58:37.403 --> 58:38.644
It's just not books.

58:38.764 --> 58:41.747
I did start to go... I think that's a very important point to make.

58:42.008 --> 58:50.796
So why in Virginia Woolfin did you have a... Because I felt a connection to the material for some reason.

58:51.077 --> 58:53.599
And I just didn't want to see it.

58:53.619 --> 58:55.361
Did you have conversations about this?

58:56.942 --> 58:57.663
Yeah, he went up.

58:58.864 --> 58:59.865
For his books.

59:00.606 --> 59:02.988
No, they're not his books.

59:03.048 --> 59:03.989
They're our books.

59:04.009 --> 59:05.691
Actually, I take a lot of pride in

59:06.008 --> 59:06.869
Collecting together.

59:06.889 --> 59:17.061
I mean, certain things that I do because it's my choice, but I like to have Donna's share with me.

59:17.641 --> 59:19.443
I really like to have Donna's share with me.

59:19.623 --> 59:25.390
I mean, book collecting can be a very solitary occupation.

59:25.911 --> 59:30.776
I kind of started to think about collecting children's books.

59:30.916 --> 59:34.260
I kind of went off into that area a little bit.

59:34.561 --> 59:38.766
On my own, it wasn't of interest to Bob at the time that I suggested it.

59:41.990 --> 59:48.478
You know, I think I am more attracted to the visuals.

59:48.758 --> 59:51.661
He's more attracted to the printed word.

59:52.342 --> 59:57.989
So, you know... Except that he showed me some extraordinary illustrations.

59:58.029 --> 59:59.571
Yes, that's also true.

59:59.691 --> 01:00:03.235
And I, you know, it's just that we kind of haven't found...

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:30.083
common ground for book collecting so i'm perfectly happy collecting all my other things and i have you know but it's just right i've seen but could you just tell me briefly some of the things that you've caught well i mean i i like uh china i haven't collected china it's not all out you mean you mean the country or do you mean no china i live in china i i go for uh

01:00:30.535 --> 01:00:48.848
beautiful table-silver settings, old silver costume jewelry from 10th century to through the great period of costume jewelry which ended in the 40s.
