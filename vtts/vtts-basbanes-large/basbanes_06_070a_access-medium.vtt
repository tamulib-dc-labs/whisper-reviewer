WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:11.317
These are in excellent condition, I have to say.

00:11.417 --> 00:11.617
U.S.

00:11.717 --> 00:13.980
Naval Academy.

00:16.443 --> 00:18.085
So you were a collector?

00:18.145 --> 00:20.227
Did you realize at this point that you were a collector?

00:20.247 --> 00:20.508
No.

00:22.170 --> 00:30.139
So we found ourselves buying WPAs because we were using them.

00:30.743 --> 00:32.124
I'm going to just put this over.

00:32.144 --> 00:33.325
Just not even thinking about it, okay?

00:34.967 --> 00:35.167
Okay.

00:35.187 --> 00:37.329
Okay.

00:37.349 --> 00:41.213
Well, in business, I have always traveled.

00:41.253 --> 00:58.168
I would find myself in Bluefield, West Virginia, running a couponing test, or Mason City, Iowa, setting up displays for a new product.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.252
So what do you do in the evening?

01:02.794 --> 01:08.261
The hotels then were, you know, I can picture them, concrete block buildings two stories high.

01:09.322 --> 01:27.565
The room had an iron bed, a big black hissing radiator, a bureau with a big mirror, and if you had a bath, the toilet was running, and the tub with cloth feet was

01:27.865 --> 01:31.248
It was stained from drippings from the faucet.

01:32.069 --> 01:36.293
So you didn't want to, and there would be a light bulb, a bare light bulb on a cord over the bed.

01:37.134 --> 01:42.178
So you didn't want to stay, there was no reason to stay in the room in the evening, so you'd go out.

01:42.339 --> 01:44.861
So those days I didn't drink.

01:45.161 --> 01:53.589
So the only two kinds of businesses that are open in the evening, and every small town had them.

01:55.311 --> 01:56.792
First of all, there was a bar.

01:58.274 --> 02:00.897
And then there was a bookstore, a used bookstore.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.718
So I would go to the used bookstore.

02:03.179 --> 02:04.040
Why do you think of that?

02:04.140 --> 02:07.623
Why were used bookstores so popular in the Midwest, do you think?

02:07.643 --> 02:08.784
Well, in the whole country.

02:08.844 --> 02:10.105
It wasn't just the Midwest.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.989
All over the country there were used bookstores.

02:14.089 --> 02:17.312
They've gone now because rents have gone up and they can't afford them.

02:17.393 --> 02:18.714
I love used bookstores.

02:18.734 --> 02:26.121
So I suppose at one point I'd been in 90 percent of the used bookstores in the country.

02:27.417 --> 02:29.319
And most of them are gone.

02:35.065 --> 02:36.466
So I'd spend the evening there.

02:37.207 --> 02:41.511
Every book dealer is interesting.

02:41.551 --> 02:42.492
They're erudite.

02:42.632 --> 02:43.913
They're interesting people.

02:44.334 --> 02:45.275
You'd talk with them.

02:45.295 --> 02:45.795
You'd chat.

02:45.815 --> 02:46.516
You'd look around.

02:46.556 --> 02:55.585
And sort of in thanks, at the end of the evening, I'd buy a book for a buck or 75 cents or a dollar and a quarter.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.484
Now, you weren't necessarily going to these places to buy books.

02:58.765 --> 03:00.166
No, it was wasting time.

03:00.266 --> 03:02.429
It was amusement, basically.

03:02.469 --> 03:14.804
And all my business career, I went from P&G to Standard Brands, where I marketed Jason's Amborn coffee and Tenderleaf tea.

03:14.824 --> 03:18.068
And then I went to Borden, where I spent most of my business career.

03:18.128 --> 03:19.750
I was there over 30 years.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.076
In advertising, marketing?

03:23.137 --> 03:24.078
Yeah, marketing.

03:24.479 --> 03:28.765
When I retired, I was vice president of corporate development.

03:28.785 --> 03:39.661
I did Borden's planning and acquisition work at what companies like Wise Potato Chips and Real Lemon and Sacramento Tomato Juice and Snow's Clams.

03:39.882 --> 03:42.185
These are all my favorite practice.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.868
Yeah.

03:44.348 --> 03:50.057
But I traveled, and I still travel.

03:51.488 --> 03:56.494
I remember one day I was, I got thinking, people talk about first editions.

03:56.614 --> 03:59.096
I knew absolutely nothing about first editions.

04:01.860 --> 04:06.845
So I, I decided I'd like to learn, so I picked an author.

04:07.226 --> 04:08.227
This is about when, sir?

04:08.927 --> 04:10.769
Oh, in the early 40s.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.212
So it's still, it's only been a couple of years.

04:13.292 --> 04:18.458
Yeah, so I picked an author that nobody collected, Frank Stock.

04:19.147 --> 04:28.359
A lot of books, perhaps 50, and they were juveniles, so it was hard to get them in good condition.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.421
Why did you pick them?

04:30.161 --> 04:35.689
Well, because nobody collected them, and they were cheap, because nobody collected them.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.970
But you liked them as an author?

04:36.990 --> 04:38.152
I couldn't afford them.

04:38.192 --> 04:40.956
I was making a job when we got married.

04:41.016 --> 04:45.762
I was making $150 a month.

04:46.349 --> 04:47.991
So how much money do you have for books?

04:48.212 --> 04:53.719
Books didn't cost very much, but even so, you know, every quarter was important.

04:55.442 --> 05:01.971
So I started collecting first editions of Frank Stockton, and they're on the top two shelves over there.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.733
You still have them?

05:03.753 --> 05:07.859
For 50 years I've been collecting Frank Stockton, and I still have one item to go.

05:09.001 --> 05:09.401
Really?

05:09.742 --> 05:10.162
Yeah.

05:10.182 --> 05:10.663
What is it?

05:10.683 --> 05:11.244
I'll look for it.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.630
Well, it's a pamphlet called Northern Voice.

05:16.775 --> 05:20.080
toward the dissolution of the union.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.743
And it doesn't even have his name on it.

05:23.484 --> 05:25.127
It's listed in Ransom.

05:27.190 --> 05:42.972
So then, in business, I did a lot of, of course, advertising, but public relations and publicity work.

05:42.992 --> 05:46.697
I was building a powdered milk business, and nobody

05:47.555 --> 05:56.905
was interested in powder milk, and they knew nothing about it, so it was a problem of getting to educators, you see, and food editors.

05:59.227 --> 06:08.897
So I met a food editor of the, I guess, New York Times.

06:08.978 --> 06:13.242
Her name was Edith Asbury.

06:14.437 --> 06:18.782
I found out that she was married to an author by the name of Herbert Asbury.

06:21.085 --> 06:22.046
A-S-B-U-R-Y.

06:22.066 --> 06:23.809
A-S-B-U-R-Y.

06:24.109 --> 06:26.572
And he wrote about interesting subjects.

06:29.676 --> 06:37.105
So I started collecting his books, and nobody collects Herbert Asbury at all today.

06:37.125 --> 06:41.811
And they were hard to find.

06:42.652 --> 06:53.421
I ended up with maybe 20 books by Herbert Asbury, and one day Edith said to me, gee, you know, Herbert would love to, you know, if you'd like, he'd sign them for you.

06:53.882 --> 06:59.306
So, okay, so he came up to the office, and I had so many of these things, I was embarrassed.

06:59.326 --> 07:02.329
He was coming up to sign one book, so I put them under my desk.

07:02.549 --> 07:04.130
He wasn't embarrassing, but he loved it.

07:04.151 --> 07:05.792
I would pull them out one at a time.

07:05.832 --> 07:07.033
And here they are.

07:07.073 --> 07:11.697
These are all.

07:12.385 --> 07:16.691
She wrote about Carrie Nation.

07:17.913 --> 07:19.395
C-A-R-R-Y-N-A-T-H-A-Y.

07:19.435 --> 07:20.616
She's the one with the hatchet.

07:20.656 --> 07:23.500
She'd go around and break up the barge, you know.

07:24.662 --> 07:25.423
1954.

07:25.483 --> 07:32.733
For Fred Bord, I suppose the moral of this book is that women should be very careful when they reach middle age.

07:32.853 --> 07:39.242
Carrie Nation went off a rocker because of a drunken person, an insane daughter, and a menopause.

07:39.262 --> 07:41.565
Now, that's a great instruction agency when it's needed.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.899
It's March 30th, 54th.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.322
And he wrote... These are nice-looking books.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.284
These are Alfred Knopf.

07:48.825 --> 07:50.487
He wrote one detective story.

07:50.507 --> 07:52.268
This is almost impossible to find.

07:52.289 --> 07:54.731
He wrote largely, I gather, non-fiction books.

07:54.751 --> 07:55.492
Is that correct?

07:55.512 --> 07:56.093
Yeah.

07:56.113 --> 07:57.695
Gangs of New York.

07:58.355 --> 08:02.840
The Gangs of New York.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.502
Up from Methodism.

08:04.562 --> 08:05.864
That's about Chicago.

08:07.485 --> 08:08.567
The Barbary Coast.

08:08.607 --> 08:09.848
This one is interesting.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.863
This is called The Devil of Peeling.

08:14.164 --> 08:16.047
It's E-I-L-I-N-G.

08:16.227 --> 08:18.250
E-E-I-L-I-N-G.

08:18.410 --> 08:24.019
If you're a good goblin-ridden Christian, you've got to leave all this stuff.

08:24.039 --> 08:27.384
I wrote this book in three weeks on a bet with Carl Van Doren.

08:27.665 --> 08:28.426
Carl Van Doren.

08:29.087 --> 08:34.255
Who said I couldn't do a good horror mystery in that time.

08:34.576 --> 08:37.320
He always insisted he won the bet.

08:37.604 --> 08:43.555
Now, these are all inscribed on that one day, March 30th, 1954.

08:43.575 --> 08:44.557
That's a cute story.

08:44.617 --> 08:45.619
I like that.

08:45.639 --> 08:46.320
How many did he do?

08:46.340 --> 08:47.061
Did he do 20?

08:47.241 --> 08:47.863
He did them all.

08:48.464 --> 08:49.726
Oh, that's a wonderful story.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.050
I'll bet he was flattered.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.637
He was running out of juice when he did this one.

08:55.657 --> 08:56.538
Can I just hold on?

08:56.558 --> 08:57.821
I want to just read what it says.

08:58.081 --> 08:59.524
This is a cute little story here, by the way.

08:59.564 --> 09:01.367
I like this.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.045
The title of this is Ye Olde, OLDE, Fire Ladies, to Fred Boyd.

09:06.205 --> 09:06.506
Latties.

09:06.526 --> 09:07.086
Latties.

09:07.126 --> 09:07.907
I'm sorry.

09:07.987 --> 09:08.828
I'm sorry.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.769
L-A-D-D-I-S.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.232
That is just to Fred Boyd with all the best.

09:12.252 --> 09:12.513
Yeah.

09:14.435 --> 09:16.237
Again, March 30th, 54th.

09:16.257 --> 09:16.497
All right.

09:16.517 --> 09:17.939
So there I was collecting.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.121
How many titles would you say?

09:20.142 --> 09:26.629
Well, I would say, let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

09:28.077 --> 09:28.618
About 20.

09:28.638 --> 09:30.039
15 or 20, yes.

09:30.599 --> 09:33.042
And is that basically the oeuvre?

09:33.943 --> 09:35.684
Is that what he wrote, or is there more than that?

09:35.704 --> 09:38.907
Yeah, unless they won't know, that's it.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.168
These doctors are serious.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.130
They must have been thrilled to have a serious collector.

09:42.350 --> 09:48.877
These are all in good condition, and that's one of the challenges with collecting books, condition.

09:48.897 --> 09:49.637
Those are wonderful books.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.720
Condition and condition.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.743
And again, you say it's about 40 titles.

09:55.763 --> 09:55.823
No.

09:56.326 --> 10:05.416
Then I started collecting Lafcari O'Hearn, who lived in Cincinnati and wrote for a paper there, and then he moved to New Orleans, and then he moved to Japan.

10:05.476 --> 10:09.160
And Lafcari O'Hearn popularized Japan in this country.

10:10.942 --> 10:14.186
Mays, do you want to go in another room?

10:14.206 --> 10:21.414
These four shows are first editions of Lafcari O'Hearn.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.759
Should we leave you right below for a while?

10:26.161 --> 10:27.663
You want to go on the other phone?

10:27.683 --> 10:31.067
No, I mean, you wouldn't have to leave her alone.

10:31.087 --> 10:31.768
I'd better go, yeah.

10:31.928 --> 10:35.292
I'm just saying that maybe she'd like some privacy here, so.

10:35.312 --> 10:36.453
I'd better go.

10:36.473 --> 10:37.795
This is what you wanted here.

10:37.815 --> 10:39.677
Then we're talking about Lafcadio Hearn, I think.

10:39.737 --> 10:44.823
So I collected Lafcadio Hearn, and there are four shelves of them over there.

10:44.863 --> 10:46.485
I'm just going to put this next to you over here.

10:46.745 --> 10:51.991
And so I guess gradually, he's very hot now.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.174
Lafcadio Hearn has really taken off.

10:54.234 --> 10:54.894
Did you know that?

10:55.035 --> 10:55.375
No.

10:56.283 --> 10:59.407
At a few sales, I've been to all the major sales in New York.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.870
His prices are pretty crazy.

11:02.371 --> 11:07.538
Well, there are some fine... The Japanese are buying him a great guest, though.

11:07.558 --> 11:10.462
Yeah, but he popularized Japan.

11:10.482 --> 11:15.649
But some of these locatio iron items are pretty good.

11:17.251 --> 11:21.297
This is probably one of the hardest to find.

11:22.138 --> 11:23.099
Oh, that's wonderful.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.841
Look at the condition of that.

11:24.861 --> 11:25.362
That's...

11:25.628 --> 11:31.035
La Cuisine, Cousins, C-O-U-S-I-N-A, Creole.

11:32.416 --> 11:37.783
I got that from Ellen Shaker, who now is a... Oh, I read this author out in California.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.305
She's in my book.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.310
She wrote, she sold this to me when she was at Dawson's.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.552
When she was at Dawson's.

11:44.572 --> 11:45.533
Yeah, I paid $100.

11:46.174 --> 11:48.597
She started in Philadelphia and then went out to Dawson's?

11:48.657 --> 11:51.400
No, no, she started at Dawson's and then went to...

11:51.734 --> 11:54.918
Is that our book room in Philadelphia?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.319
And then she went to the Sylvia.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.381
Yeah, the Norman.

11:58.021 --> 11:58.722
Norman Strauss.

11:59.743 --> 12:02.907
But there are a lot of the— You must know Mr. Strauss.

12:02.927 --> 12:07.052
He was a— Yeah, he was the chairman of the— That's right, because the advertisement.

12:07.072 --> 12:08.474
Was it J. Walter Thompson there?

12:08.614 --> 12:08.774
Right.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.056
I think it was J. Walter.

12:10.116 --> 12:10.536
Exactly.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.362
But there are some good friends there.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.963
I don't think I should take that paper off.

12:17.983 --> 12:19.285
It's always been honest.

12:19.305 --> 12:24.053
I think you should leave it on after all these years.

12:24.073 --> 12:29.021
Briefly, what did Asbury think of the fact that you were such an assiduous collector of his books?

12:29.061 --> 12:30.183
Well, I don't know.

12:30.403 --> 12:31.585
I was sort of surprised.

12:31.605 --> 12:32.867
This is a Chinese ghost.

12:32.887 --> 12:35.071
That's one of his noted things.

12:35.191 --> 12:40.219
You know, here's Carnegie Bookstore, 59th Street in New York.

12:40.975 --> 12:42.837
1951, but his books came out.

12:42.857 --> 12:46.522
You know, I interviewed Dave Kirschenbaum, who was part of Carnegie Books.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.226
He's 97 years old, and he still goes to the auctions.

12:49.366 --> 12:50.207
Dave's in my book.

12:50.507 --> 12:53.171
His daughters are running a business, I guess.

12:53.812 --> 12:56.235
He's there five days a week.

12:56.295 --> 13:01.742
Yeah.

13:05.066 --> 13:08.991
So gradually, I guess, I was becoming a

13:09.680 --> 13:10.541
Book collector.

13:11.162 --> 13:12.144
But did you know it at this point?

13:12.164 --> 13:13.646
You must have known it at this point.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.048
Well, I don't know.

13:15.088 --> 13:20.156
The reason the question is asked is when do you know that you're a collector?

13:20.176 --> 13:21.818
You have to know that you're a collector.

13:21.838 --> 13:25.243
You're not buying these books to read them, obviously, right?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.785
I mean, you hadn't been buying them.

13:26.825 --> 13:28.768
No, I don't buy books to read them.

13:28.848 --> 13:35.779
People say... I mean, at this point, you're certainly buying these because you want them as artifacts, I guess.

13:35.959 --> 13:38.623
People say, do you read all these books?

13:39.295 --> 13:40.276
No, I don't read them.

13:40.596 --> 13:42.058
I don't read any of them, really.

13:42.098 --> 13:44.821
It's the chase that I enjoy.

13:44.841 --> 13:45.802
It's a challenge.

13:46.122 --> 13:49.245
And I guess that's what I was doing at business.

13:49.405 --> 13:51.487
I was buying companies.

13:51.728 --> 13:52.749
I was chasing them.

13:52.769 --> 13:55.051
It's quite a challenge to find a company.

13:56.152 --> 13:58.695
It took five years to buy the Cracker Jack Company.

13:59.996 --> 14:06.783
And it's taken me 50 years to complete Frank Stockton, and I haven't completed Frank Stockton yet.

14:06.803 --> 14:08.365
That's a great quote.

14:08.385 --> 14:08.745
I love that quote.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.385
And this, again, is for, now, you mentioned three companies.

14:12.405 --> 14:15.870
You spent most of your business career with Ford.

14:15.950 --> 14:19.295
Ford, yeah.

14:19.315 --> 14:19.495
Okay.

14:19.515 --> 14:28.368
So, of course, then, you know, you pick up miscellaneous stuff that interests you, and you can see that.

14:28.649 --> 14:37.602
I found, I got interested in a private press called Mosier, done in Portland, Maine.

14:38.088 --> 14:39.089
It's M-O-S-H-E-R.

14:39.289 --> 14:39.890
M-O-S-H-E-R.

14:40.230 --> 14:40.851
There they are.

14:41.852 --> 14:44.855
Yeah, they're all over the place.

14:45.336 --> 14:48.579
He said maybe 500 items I have all, but three or four.

14:49.500 --> 14:56.027
How do you feel about the items that you don't have?

14:57.489 --> 15:01.513
Very delicate.

15:03.097 --> 15:05.400
Now, these were looking at the Ozark Country.

15:05.420 --> 15:08.443
These are the, uh... It's just this series, you know.

15:08.543 --> 15:10.305
It amounts to nothing, really.

15:10.325 --> 15:14.930
425 copies of this book that printed on Japan's Ellen.

15:14.950 --> 15:16.672
Yeah, these are fine press books.

15:16.873 --> 15:17.113
Yeah.

15:19.816 --> 15:21.197
Rather delicate little things.

15:21.238 --> 15:23.901
1902, you see?

15:23.921 --> 15:29.627
And, of course, the challenge there is to find them and also do it in good condition.

15:32.611 --> 15:33.993
Thank you, sir.

15:34.494 --> 15:37.379
Mr. Boyd, did you participate in this?

15:38.300 --> 15:38.580
No.

15:39.622 --> 15:51.200
Do you take pleasure in the ownership of these?

15:52.162 --> 15:57.170
Well, how do you keep track of what you have?

15:57.310 --> 15:58.852
I deal with file cords.

15:58.953 --> 16:00.475
There's cabinets over there.

16:01.366 --> 16:06.353
eight drawers of file cards, and every one of them is full.

16:07.634 --> 16:18.028
When I read a dealer's catalog and I see something I have, I clip it, and I mark it and date it, and then Jane pastes it on the back of that file card.

16:18.048 --> 16:22.834
So I keep track of where things are valued, you see.

16:22.854 --> 16:29.483
And I get it in case something happens to me where Jane would have some clue as to what

16:30.610 --> 16:37.016
I didn't do it for my ... I know, but she doesn't.

16:37.036 --> 16:44.443
And so I thought, well, if we cook catalogs, she would have some idea of what they're worth.

16:44.463 --> 16:49.628
So ... I said to my wife, I don't care if you sell them, just get what they're worth.

16:50.069 --> 16:51.410
Yeah.

16:51.430 --> 16:55.054
Incidentally, it's not ... You buy them a book at a time.

16:56.155 --> 16:57.997
That's right.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.499
And I'm surprised when somebody comes in and says, I'll give you $1.98 for the room full.

17:00.580 --> 17:30.115
happened yeah well it isn't easy to sell books since then i'm finding because i'm starting to sell a few and uh duplicates yeah of which of which authors in particular oh really do you have all of wpa by the way were you able to oh no no i don't know how many there are impossible because i'll bet i probably have 500 different titles but uh

17:31.816 --> 17:32.437
Oh, yeah.

17:32.657 --> 17:35.681
Some of the WPA things were mini-aggressed.

17:35.701 --> 17:50.121
And they would take 50 and give them to a school principal, where they'd be in his closet for six months, and then they'd be in the closet down the hall for six months, and then they'd be in the basement for five years, and somebody would say, let's get rid of them.

17:52.244 --> 17:55.829
So I gradually found that I was collecting books.

17:57.571 --> 18:00.135
And when we moved here, these were the ones...

18:01.027 --> 18:01.668
that I had.

18:02.108 --> 18:05.472
And moved here again, I think you said in 56.

18:05.492 --> 18:06.573
In 57.

18:06.593 --> 18:07.814
And it's sort of a mixture.

18:07.854 --> 18:13.981
There's Frank Stockton, LaCudio Hearn, Herbert Asbury, some Moshe Press, some series.

18:15.022 --> 18:16.764
There's the colophon over there.

18:16.784 --> 18:19.947
I have all the colophons.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.368
There's a river series.

18:21.569 --> 18:28.536
And I bought the colophon in New York, down on 4th Avenue, which used to be the Book Street.

18:29.545 --> 18:31.568
Most of the shops have gone from there now.

18:32.249 --> 18:38.457
How many did you say you had?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.461
Well, I'm not sure.

18:41.501 --> 18:44.125
There are well over a hundred books on epitaph.

18:44.145 --> 18:47.530
This is a crazy subject, but it's— How do you pick your subjects?

18:47.670 --> 18:48.331
How did you pick your subjects?

18:48.351 --> 18:48.932
Well, I don't know.

18:49.092 --> 18:53.298
I just—I bought things that I liked, and then you sort of get involved, you know?

18:53.318 --> 18:55.080
Did you have a feeling that you were—

18:55.162 --> 18:59.869
setting the trend, I mean, you're kind of ahead of the, these are subject selections, I guess.

19:00.309 --> 19:06.198
Well, I collect... I collect maybe 10 or 12 authors.

19:07.540 --> 19:15.852
I collect maybe four or five presses, certain subjects.

19:16.733 --> 19:20.839
Jane collects Arthur Rackham, I find them for her, an illustrator.

19:20.879 --> 19:23.683
I collect another...

19:24.052 --> 19:33.105
Another illustrator by the name of Bernhard Wohl, he etched books.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.667
Every page is etched.

19:34.687 --> 19:35.328
Isn't that wonderful?

19:35.428 --> 19:36.189
How do you spell his name?

19:36.870 --> 19:40.395
Bernhard, H-A-R-D-T, Wohl, W-A-L-L.

19:40.475 --> 19:40.995
An American?

19:41.636 --> 19:45.221
Yeah, he lived in, he did this in Rime Rock, Connecticut.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.785
Oh, that's beautiful.

19:49.547 --> 19:50.829
Yeah, this is not American.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.293
It's supposed to be published yet.

19:53.313 --> 19:53.653
Yeah, it's great.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.981
Yeah, that's a nice book.

19:57.001 --> 19:59.164
Yeah, that's great.

19:59.204 --> 20:01.867
My wife and I collect Winslow Homer and Child Hassan.

20:04.910 --> 20:05.851
We'll talk about that later.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.513
I don't want to bore you with that, collecting that.

20:07.533 --> 20:13.299
Then I collect certain subjects, like epitaphs.

20:15.101 --> 20:17.243
And when we say epitaphs, what do you mean?

20:17.263 --> 20:18.464
Books on epitaphs.

20:18.504 --> 20:21.027
Both of them are humorous.

20:21.047 --> 20:21.868
I see.

20:22.085 --> 20:28.595
They look, by the look of the spine, they look like they're largely 19th century books.

20:28.615 --> 20:30.559
Is that fair or something?

20:30.579 --> 20:31.861
No, not completely.

20:31.881 --> 20:49.088
I was in a store on 59th Street in New York years ago, and I found half a dozen books on epithets, and they had a book plate in them, W. G. Bowden, B-O-W-D-O-I-N, who I believe was the

20:49.945 --> 20:53.388
At one point, it was a literary editor of the Brooklyn Eagles.

20:53.608 --> 20:54.829
Apparently, he collected them.

20:54.889 --> 20:56.230
He was gotten rid of them.

20:56.250 --> 21:01.855
So I bought them, and that started me on epitaphs.

21:01.875 --> 21:08.761
So I collected certain presses, Moser, Windsor Press, Allen Press.

21:09.722 --> 21:10.563
A-L-L-E-N?

21:10.583 --> 21:12.064
Yeah.

21:12.164 --> 21:12.885
California.

21:13.245 --> 21:16.568
I'm just saying it for the tape recorder.

21:16.588 --> 21:19.851
There was one in there, Caroline Slade, Sylvia Gray.

21:20.489 --> 21:29.343
at 103, at 109, reached for a fruit and broke her spine.

21:29.363 --> 21:29.444
Wow.

21:30.806 --> 21:37.316
You said about a dozen authors, so in addition to Stockton and Asbury and Hurin, who else did you collect?

21:37.336 --> 21:47.593
Well, some British authors, Claude Houghton, Rhys Davies, Norman Douglas, Mary Webb,

21:49.953 --> 21:50.794
Who else, Jane?

21:51.876 --> 21:52.516
This is great.

21:52.577 --> 21:53.578
I don't know any of them.

21:53.778 --> 21:56.562
I mean, did you basically... Lafcadio Hearn.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.705
Lafcadio Hearn, I know, of course.

21:58.725 --> 22:00.708
And Stockton, I'm familiar with.

22:00.728 --> 22:03.351
It's really hard to keep in mind what you do play.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.234
You say it, you remember.

22:06.375 --> 22:10.401
Now, this Mosier Press, this is a Mosier, too.

22:10.561 --> 22:15.808
This is a big item, this is a big book, you know?

22:20.682 --> 22:24.968
Here's the bibliography of Moser, one of them.

22:25.128 --> 22:26.050
That's a beautiful book.

22:26.230 --> 22:31.177
This is one of the nicest books I've ever seen, done by the Gahanna Press.

22:31.738 --> 22:36.125
Well, Leonard Boskin is one of my subjects, I should point out.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.648
There it is.

22:38.668 --> 22:43.395
Thomas Bird, M-I-R-D, Moser, M-O-S-H-E-R, Portland, Maine.

22:43.495 --> 22:46.740
It has inserts in his different series and...

22:47.193 --> 22:49.275
There's a title page of another series.

22:49.295 --> 22:50.076
This is gorgeous.

22:50.516 --> 22:51.437
Leonard did this book.

22:51.477 --> 22:52.739
This is wonderful.

22:52.759 --> 22:54.020
It's a beautiful book.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.364
He's having his 50th anniversary this year, you know, the Gehenna Press.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.069
I have maybe three copies of this thing.

23:03.149 --> 23:03.870
That's splendid, isn't it?

23:03.910 --> 23:05.031
How many did he publish?

23:05.471 --> 23:06.933
500, it says.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.055
500, yeah, 135.

23:09.395 --> 23:11.517
It's a thought-after book now.

23:13.419 --> 23:14.280
I've paid...

23:15.492 --> 23:17.817
$28 for it in 1967.

23:19.500 --> 23:19.580
Wow.

23:19.600 --> 23:25.852
Do you do most of your acquisitions through dealers, or do you kind of go out?

23:26.093 --> 23:27.816
You talk about the hunt and the chase.

23:27.936 --> 23:33.647
Well, I used to go to stores, but stores have gone.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.591
You know, Carnegie is still there.

23:35.631 --> 23:36.994
Not Carnegie is gone.

23:38.189 --> 23:39.852
Well, Carnegie's just a little office.

23:40.893 --> 23:42.155
What was he?

23:42.175 --> 23:42.976
He was Carnegie.

23:43.036 --> 23:44.098
No, he was Argosy.

23:44.118 --> 23:44.819
Oh, Argosy is still there.

23:44.839 --> 23:46.081
Yeah, Argosy is still there.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.223
Carnegie is gone.

23:48.685 --> 23:49.586
The Strand is fun.

23:49.606 --> 23:50.748
Do you ever go down to the Strand?

23:50.768 --> 23:52.290
Oh, Dober and Pine, yeah.

23:52.851 --> 23:53.712
That's because it's different.

23:53.833 --> 24:00.202
I went there, but I found out that they assign a security guard to you when you're in there.

24:00.503 --> 24:01.985
They follow you around.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.207
It bothers me.

24:03.287 --> 24:05.650
I don't want somebody standing watching me.

24:06.472 --> 24:07.453
I don't go there anymore.

24:08.564 --> 24:20.264
But then I found I was buying things like this in two volumes.

24:20.505 --> 24:23.530
This has got seven hornbooks.

24:24.111 --> 24:28.138
And these are authentic.

24:28.439 --> 24:29.540
These are American or British?

24:29.921 --> 24:32.766
British.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.984
As I'd go into bookstores, I'd run into those things.

24:42.145 --> 24:48.432
I found this in Chicago.

24:48.512 --> 25:05.250
On the same day, I found a set of Huns in Special Binding, and they both cost about $100, so I had to make a choice, because I've never seen that in the other one.

25:06.277 --> 25:13.167
I was in a bookstore on Van Buren Street in Chicago and I found this.

25:14.489 --> 25:18.556
This Lanthorn book.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.443
It's got stories in it by various authors.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.397
And they're signed by the authors.

25:33.719 --> 25:34.139
Oh, really?

25:34.400 --> 25:34.680
Yeah.

25:35.065 --> 25:36.127
Here's Stephen Crane.

25:36.147 --> 25:36.768
Oh, Stephen Crane?

25:36.788 --> 25:37.248
Oh, my God.

25:37.388 --> 25:40.373
Now, Stephen Crane... Could you give me the title of this book again?

25:40.673 --> 25:41.735
It's called The Lanthorn.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.519
L-A-N-T-H-O-R-N.

25:44.539 --> 25:45.340
And it's uncut.

25:45.901 --> 25:47.784
I just ran into this.

25:47.924 --> 25:48.885
The 125th.

25:49.266 --> 25:51.930
Can I just see who published it?

25:53.973 --> 25:54.814
It doesn't really say.

25:54.854 --> 25:59.801
Being a small collection of tales and verses that are signed on the lantern.

25:59.821 --> 26:02.946
But here are the authors, you see, and they're all signed...

26:05.288 --> 26:06.469
Well, Crane.

26:08.591 --> 26:10.473
I have to believe the Crane is pretty good.

26:10.693 --> 26:16.499
Crane, you know, Crane, I have a little biography here.

26:18.221 --> 26:22.085
Signed only 13 copies with all of these signatures.

26:22.806 --> 26:26.289
Also see randoms duped them large enough, page 222.

26:26.810 --> 26:29.893
Only, he says, 10 to 15 copies signed by Crane.

26:30.453 --> 26:32.555
Crane was the one that didn't sign most of them.

26:32.715 --> 26:34.317
And you have this one signed by Crane.

26:35.107 --> 26:37.209
And that's in Dave Randall's book.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.471
I'll check that out, yeah.

26:38.651 --> 26:38.871
Yeah.

26:39.792 --> 26:40.633
It's page 222.

26:40.693 --> 26:45.818
I noted it.

26:45.838 --> 26:51.584
So, you know, so here I'm buying unusual things.

26:55.809 --> 27:00.094
That's okay, sir.

27:00.114 --> 27:00.574
This is...

27:01.043 --> 27:05.887
One of the nicest books ever published, along with the bibliography of Mosier.

27:08.049 --> 27:09.710
The Island Voyage by Robert Louis.

27:09.730 --> 27:11.652
This is done by the Overbrook Press.

27:13.814 --> 27:16.936
And the Overbrook Press was about a mile from here.

27:16.956 --> 27:18.097
Oh, that's gorgeous.

27:18.478 --> 27:19.539
There's a lithograph.

27:19.559 --> 27:19.799
Pochoir.

27:20.079 --> 27:20.720
Yeah.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.560
Is that the way you say it?

27:21.620 --> 27:22.981
Pochoir?

27:23.001 --> 27:23.081
Yes.

27:23.122 --> 27:23.862
Oh, isn't that lovely?

27:24.082 --> 27:25.744
It's a lovely book.

27:25.764 --> 27:26.985
Look at those illustrations.

27:27.325 --> 27:27.425
Yeah.

27:27.565 --> 27:27.845
It's splendid.

27:28.906 --> 27:30.848
I did that with stencils, I believe.

27:31.992 --> 27:37.218
That is a splendid looking book.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.800
150 copies, you know.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.143
And who is the printer on this once again?

27:41.163 --> 27:43.245
Overbrook, right down the road here.

27:43.305 --> 27:43.706
Really?

27:44.306 --> 27:47.550
Frank Altshaw, who is from the investment community.

27:47.771 --> 27:49.412
Altshaw, the state is still there.

27:49.553 --> 27:51.315
It's got 500 acres.

27:51.435 --> 27:53.377
Isn't that splendid?

27:53.397 --> 27:55.840
Look at that color.

27:56.579 --> 28:05.057
There's a brook there, and there was a pigsty up on a hill over there, and he turned the pigsty into a press.

28:05.077 --> 28:10.588
I bought that city auction, 1956, for $25.

28:13.775 --> 28:22.925
Well, this rambling fail, you can see I'm gradually... No, we're getting there, and that's why I haven't diverged from the trail.

28:22.945 --> 28:26.688
It's basically going the way I'm pleased to be.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.450
I'm getting into other things.

28:28.670 --> 28:29.351
I understand.

28:30.733 --> 28:31.734
These are Moses.

28:33.856 --> 28:39.422
Here's a book translated by... That's the Herbert Hoover book.

28:39.462 --> 28:40.423
That's a letter from him.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.685
That's Agricola...

28:42.766 --> 29:11.187
in there metallica and his collection is at claremont college in california he and his wife translated that oh here is the great book collecting president by the way very rather unknown fact this is one of the bernhard wall books i have to just commend you on the splendid condition of all of your books you have to uh you have to be careful about conditions

29:11.825 --> 29:13.787
It's like buying a piece of china.

29:13.927 --> 29:17.630
You see a dealer, and there's a chip in it, and they say, oh, that doesn't make any difference.

29:17.670 --> 29:23.136
But when you go to sell it, the chip cup, it makes a big difference.

29:23.156 --> 29:25.278
I don't think, but I don't think you're moved by that.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.860
I think you're moved by getting the best that you can get.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.243
This was owned by a famous collector, George Spriske.

29:31.283 --> 29:35.147
He also founds the books.

29:36.168 --> 29:40.752
But Wall did every page...

29:41.035 --> 29:41.796
These are etchings.

29:42.076 --> 29:42.657
These etchings.

29:42.677 --> 29:43.377
That's raised.

29:45.099 --> 29:49.484
And that's signed by three people.

29:53.908 --> 29:57.092
Oh, these... 19... Duncan Gleason.

29:57.112 --> 29:57.492
...22.

29:57.833 --> 30:04.980
Even the... That's what I've seen, really.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.683
Well, there are a lot of walls around here.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.084
That's wonderful.

30:09.124 --> 30:09.565
Look at that.

30:09.585 --> 30:10.806
See, he lettered it.

30:11.849 --> 30:13.711
He started out in Lime Rock, Connecticut.

30:13.731 --> 30:25.026
He moved to Texas, and then he moved to the Los Angeles area, where he died in an insane asylum.

30:25.046 --> 30:26.528
Look at this.

30:26.548 --> 30:27.489
Oh, that's wonderful.

30:27.609 --> 30:29.011
He did nice things, didn't he?

30:29.031 --> 30:32.175
It isn't, but it could almost be mystic, couldn't it?

30:32.796 --> 30:37.703
I was wondering if there was a limitation in this.

30:37.723 --> 30:41.147
Most of his findings are so poor that...

30:42.207 --> 30:45.972
I can tell you I'll be looking for him.

30:51.680 --> 30:58.709
I've been picking him up.

30:58.729 --> 30:59.991
It's hard to find.

31:00.131 --> 31:07.541
I hunted up his widow in Pasadena years ago, and I bought everything she had.

31:07.561 --> 31:07.862
Really?

31:09.003 --> 31:10.305
Now, whose widow again?

31:10.345 --> 31:11.807
Because there were two names there.

31:11.827 --> 31:11.927
Okay.

31:14.708 --> 31:18.472
Well, anyhow, that's... What's the Libra Scripturum?

31:19.994 --> 31:22.397
Well, it's... Oh, actually, don't pull it out.

31:22.417 --> 31:24.679
I'll just... Well, it's... Leave it there.

31:24.759 --> 31:25.120
It's fine.

31:27.663 --> 31:30.266
It's gradually getting to the oddities, you know.

31:30.286 --> 31:37.214
Here's those horn books, and this is sort of an oddity.

31:38.475 --> 31:39.476
1804.

31:43.701 --> 31:44.462
Look at that, huh?

31:45.218 --> 31:45.999
Oh, this has?

31:46.339 --> 31:47.901
This has actual wheat.

31:47.921 --> 31:48.982
Is that what it is?

31:49.002 --> 31:55.868
Now, I don't know if you've ever seen flowers and things mounted in books, but very seldom do you find them in this condition.

31:55.948 --> 31:59.091
This is 175 years old.

32:00.893 --> 32:01.594
It's more than that.

32:01.614 --> 32:02.735
It's 1804.

32:02.755 --> 32:02.855
1804.

32:03.055 --> 32:07.940
It's darn close to 180.

32:08.981 --> 32:11.083
Look at this.

32:13.185 --> 32:13.285
Yeah.

32:14.075 --> 32:15.197
These are grasses, right?

32:15.237 --> 32:17.179
Various types of grasses.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.504
Well, was this book sold like this?

32:20.864 --> 32:21.805
Yeah.

32:21.825 --> 32:22.446
Yeah, it was, sure.

32:22.486 --> 32:24.449
With the specimens mounted in.

32:24.669 --> 32:26.091
And what is the title of it again, sir?

32:29.816 --> 32:32.941
Minutes in Agriculture and Planting.

32:33.361 --> 32:33.982
That's the title.

32:34.463 --> 32:35.584
Yes.

32:35.604 --> 32:42.353
I got that from a dealer by the name of David Lowe in England.

32:42.794 --> 32:42.934
Mm-hmm.

32:43.673 --> 32:47.939
David Lowe and Graham Green were close friends.

32:49.541 --> 32:55.068
And there was a book published a couple years ago called Dear David, Dear... Oh, I know the book.

32:55.589 --> 32:56.670
Yeah.

32:56.690 --> 32:56.950
Okay.

32:58.412 --> 32:58.993
I know the book.

32:59.534 --> 33:02.838
He turned up a lot of epitaph books for me, too.

33:03.779 --> 33:08.786
Well, then I found I was buying unusual things.

33:10.228 --> 33:10.789
Great.

33:10.809 --> 33:11.790
I'm so pleased I came.

33:11.956 --> 33:14.599
I think this is the first one I bought.

33:14.840 --> 33:15.901
This started it.

33:17.002 --> 33:21.989
Really, well, I didn't know I was collecting unusual things, but this struck me.

33:22.469 --> 33:24.392
Why don't you just explain to me what it is.

33:24.412 --> 33:30.239
There is a book printed on purple paper in white ink.

33:30.279 --> 33:31.941
This started it, right?

33:32.021 --> 33:35.205
Dante's Inferno, and I still don't know anything about this book.

33:35.225 --> 33:37.548
Whose translation is it, you know?

33:37.648 --> 33:38.670
Or is it in English?

33:39.210 --> 33:40.011
No, it's in Italian.

33:40.412 --> 33:40.512
Yeah.

33:41.470 --> 33:44.394
I bought it because it was different.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.819
Does it have any kind of a publisher printed on it?

33:47.919 --> 33:48.941
No, no.

33:48.981 --> 33:50.503
The binding looks very nice.

33:50.603 --> 33:51.304
It's leather.

33:51.324 --> 33:53.067
I would say it's a—what's that?

33:53.087 --> 33:57.213
That's an octavo or a little— I would say it's maybe 1825 or something.

33:57.233 --> 34:10.853
So I had that, and then I got the Horn books, and then I got Stephen Crane signed when—he didn't sign most of them, and then I'd run into—

34:11.693 --> 34:13.676
books on colored paper.

34:13.736 --> 34:17.020
That's purple and green.

34:18.161 --> 34:18.322
Yeah.

34:18.502 --> 34:23.368
And I'd find I'd buy a shape book.

34:23.388 --> 34:25.631
That's a book shaped like a buffalo, huh?

34:26.772 --> 34:29.956
Yeah, yeah.

34:29.977 --> 34:33.741
And I'd get... Here's a book.

34:35.303 --> 34:36.525
Why don't you tell us what that is?

34:36.665 --> 34:39.709
Well, it's Charles ABC.

34:40.887 --> 34:48.880
with the letters on individual cardboard pages put together, and you can fan them out.

34:49.401 --> 34:49.942
Like a fan.

34:50.082 --> 34:50.403
Yeah, like that.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.746
It looks like a fan book, I guess, is what we call it.

34:53.347 --> 34:54.349
It's a miniature book.

34:56.392 --> 34:57.254
It's a carousel.

35:03.444 --> 35:04.145
And what's it play?

35:04.886 --> 35:06.068
Carousel music.

35:11.093 --> 35:12.635
That looks like it's fairly recent.

35:12.655 --> 35:13.757
Yes, that is.

35:15.339 --> 35:17.702
I collect pop-up books, which I think is... Oh, really?

35:17.722 --> 35:25.934
Yeah, I think pop-up books now, with the engineering and the computer stuff, are quite extraordinary right now.

35:25.954 --> 35:28.037
It's a nice little... I'm a reviewer.

35:28.077 --> 35:31.201
I'm a book critic, by the way, and I get review copies.

35:31.381 --> 35:37.069
I'm going to put my card in just so you have it, so you know who you're talking to.

35:37.109 --> 35:40.594
I'll give you a mic, or I'll give you a phone number and everything you want to say.

35:41.047 --> 35:41.588
Good.

35:41.608 --> 35:41.948
Super.

35:41.968 --> 35:42.108
Thanks.

35:42.128 --> 35:45.552
Hers is a book by Amelia Earhart.

35:45.832 --> 35:46.073
Oh.

35:49.296 --> 35:50.197
And it's inscribed.

35:50.257 --> 35:50.938
Inscribed.

35:51.038 --> 35:53.481
And it has a record of her voice in the rear pocket.

35:53.501 --> 35:53.781
Oh, really?

35:53.901 --> 35:55.403
And what's the title of this book, once again?

35:56.144 --> 35:56.905
The Fun of It.

35:57.586 --> 35:58.346
Random Records.

35:58.386 --> 35:59.408
May I just get the subtitle?

36:00.188 --> 36:04.273
Random Records of My Own Flying and of Women in Aviation.

36:04.353 --> 36:04.854
Very good.

36:08.978 --> 36:09.619
For a woman.

36:10.055 --> 36:11.857
So I paid $2.50 for it.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.778
Now it's worth $250.

36:13.858 --> 36:15.680
It wasn't a bribe when you bought it.

36:15.700 --> 36:20.244
It's for $2.50.

36:20.264 --> 36:24.508
Hamelman Barker was a pair of women in Chicago.

36:24.648 --> 36:28.151
They figure in my book, by the way.

36:29.812 --> 36:34.076
But I'm going to be happy to give you a little rundown of what we're doing with this book, I think.

36:38.900 --> 36:39.741
Well, anyhow...

36:40.987 --> 36:46.654
I found... About what point are you collecting the curiosities, shall we say?

36:48.776 --> 36:49.657
Gee, I don't know.

36:49.697 --> 36:55.324
Here's... Isaac Walton's His Wallet Book.

36:55.344 --> 37:03.514
And we open it... Published in London by Ledenhall Press in, I don't know, 1850... 1885.

37:03.974 --> 37:09.441
I should get pictures of a few of these.

37:18.348 --> 37:22.854
Go ahead, I'm just going to take a few pictures of these, because I can describe them, and I think a picture will hold me a lot more.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.636
Well, you tell me what you want, don't I?

37:24.656 --> 37:25.577
Just go ahead, just talk.

37:27.019 --> 37:31.424
I'd like to actually get a picture of that.

37:31.665 --> 37:36.150
You know, then, here's a measure.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.154
Printed on pure vellum.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.558
Look at this.

37:44.661 --> 37:47.224
One of four copies on vellum, and that's what I paid.

37:48.065 --> 37:49.868
That's worth maybe $1,000 today.

37:49.908 --> 37:51.310
That makes you feel good, doesn't it?

37:51.330 --> 37:59.122
Yeah.

37:59.142 --> 37:59.402
Look at that.

37:59.422 --> 38:01.525
Number two of four copies.

38:04.310 --> 38:10.138
I like how you were holding it.

38:10.158 --> 38:11.300
Did you say four copies?

38:11.460 --> 38:12.061
Four copies.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.423
Number two of four copies.

38:13.443 --> 38:14.044
I'm wrong.

38:14.265 --> 38:15.186
Here's a book.

38:15.976 --> 38:28.216
Here, Peter Piper, this is about the alphabet.

38:28.236 --> 38:36.489
There's the F and the G and so on, and they have it paid for the ampersand in there.

38:36.509 --> 38:41.798
And the ampersand is printed on a sheet of sandpaper, too.

38:43.938 --> 38:48.804
Yeah, but to me that makes it— That's a curiosity.

38:48.824 --> 38:49.365
Yeah.

38:49.385 --> 38:52.209
It was designed by Bruce Rogers.

38:54.732 --> 38:58.537
The title again is Peter Piper.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.639
So why do you think they picked a piece of sandpaper?

39:00.679 --> 39:03.022
Because it— Well, for the Ampersand.

39:03.563 --> 39:05.045
Ampersand.

39:05.065 --> 39:05.165
Yeah.

39:05.586 --> 39:06.567
Can we just get a picture of it?

39:07.368 --> 39:12.154
Well, what are the pages in sandpaper?

39:12.174 --> 39:12.274
Yeah.

39:21.755 --> 39:29.586
Somebody got an idea to save space in printing.

39:29.606 --> 39:33.552
If you did three or four of these things, I think it's the only one I've ever been able to find.

39:36.436 --> 39:42.745
So this quoted 1977 for $450.

39:42.885 --> 39:47.792
You got all the documentation in place, I guess.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.855
Now let's save space in printing.

39:50.577 --> 39:57.865
There are four different languages, and when you want to read a particular language, you use this screen.

39:57.885 --> 40:00.007
There's French.

40:00.067 --> 40:01.049
Funny.

40:01.069 --> 40:01.930
That is so funny.

40:02.790 --> 40:03.852
Who came up with an idea like that?

40:03.872 --> 40:04.412
There's the French.

40:05.073 --> 40:07.075
Somebody in Holland.

40:08.537 --> 40:15.364
And if you want to read the Italian, you do it German.

40:15.464 --> 40:17.006
I don't think my glasses could do it.

40:17.186 --> 40:17.967
Here it is.

40:17.987 --> 40:19.429
Unfortunately, the print is so fine.

40:19.589 --> 40:20.550
Yeah, in Spanish.

40:21.340 --> 40:25.545
English, French, Italian.

40:25.705 --> 40:27.688
What is the book?

40:27.928 --> 40:33.635
Well, it's a Euroclock.

40:33.976 --> 40:35.237
Euroclock.

40:35.477 --> 40:49.795
I was in Salt Lake City years ago.

40:50.821 --> 41:03.338
I went down to a bookstore that's still there called Sam Weller's Zion Bookstore, and I found these.

41:06.442 --> 41:16.957
Utah used to be called the, uh, Deseret, State of Deseret.

41:16.977 --> 41:17.858
So the Mormon.

41:17.998 --> 41:18.980
State of what?

41:19.420 --> 41:20.001
Deseret.

41:20.420 --> 41:33.075
So the Mormons invented an alphabet called the Deseret Alphabet, and they published four books in the Deseret Alphabet.

41:37.200 --> 41:37.760
Look at that.

41:38.321 --> 41:41.945
Published for the Deseret University, 1869.

41:43.587 --> 41:46.090
Wow.

41:50.812 --> 41:56.803
They published The Book of Mormon, The Book of Nephi, and Two Primers.

42:00.629 --> 42:11.368
And Sam Weller found these in the basement of the temple in Salt Lake City, and look at what he sold them.

42:11.509 --> 42:12.871
Forty-five dollars.

42:12.891 --> 42:13.933
Yeah, but 1958.

42:14.572 --> 42:21.581
So your collection starts in the, this particular, this departure starts in the mid-50s, is that a little right?

42:21.661 --> 42:22.082
Yeah, I guess so.

42:22.102 --> 42:22.642
I guess so.

42:22.702 --> 42:24.044
But you know, I never stopped.

42:24.064 --> 42:25.466
Here's one of the primers.

42:27.388 --> 42:28.690
Can anybody read that language?

42:28.970 --> 42:30.272
I don't know.

42:30.292 --> 42:31.193
I wouldn't try.

42:31.213 --> 42:36.880
I'm going to have to go now to History of the Mormons and just find out about this.

42:37.081 --> 42:38.723
This is news to me.

42:38.743 --> 42:40.225
Was this news to you when you saw it?

42:40.705 --> 42:42.908
Yeah, I had never heard of it.

42:43.647 --> 42:48.531
And then, you know, you find odd findings.

42:49.332 --> 42:50.633
You know, it's found in Burlap.

42:51.854 --> 42:53.495
It's a Roycroft Press.

42:53.515 --> 42:57.959
Dave Lincoln and Nancy Hanks by Albert Hubbard.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.123
They found at the Roycrofters, and they did some books.

43:03.143 --> 43:06.766
That's gorgeous, and that's bound in Burlap.

43:06.786 --> 43:07.087
Burlap.

43:08.168 --> 43:13.452
It's in the best of condition, but where else do you find it?

43:14.663 --> 43:18.307
Phonetics, Alparaiso, Indiana.

43:20.870 --> 43:22.271
It's been done in phonetics.

43:22.291 --> 43:23.352
It's phonetic alphabet.

43:23.432 --> 43:24.353
What's the title of it?

43:30.260 --> 43:30.860
That's okay.

43:30.880 --> 43:32.562
Doctrine, D-O-K.

43:32.582 --> 43:33.083
And practice.

43:33.744 --> 43:34.404
K-R-I-N.

43:35.005 --> 43:36.567
And practice.

43:36.587 --> 43:38.008
P-R-A-K-T-I-N.

43:38.148 --> 43:39.810
And all book is in phonetics.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.762
I've never seen that anyplace.

43:42.842 --> 43:44.364
I found that in Chicago.

43:44.525 --> 43:46.027
What is it?

43:46.467 --> 43:48.310
It's doctrine and practice.

43:48.410 --> 43:49.651
I don't know.

43:49.972 --> 43:50.853
I've never struggled.

43:50.953 --> 43:53.016
As I said, I don't really read them.

43:53.116 --> 43:53.877
That's wonderful.

44:04.591 --> 44:06.033
I don't put things back.

44:08.717 --> 44:09.578
They separate it here.

44:14.536 --> 44:18.060
These are books published on Birchbach I'm writing to.

44:19.261 --> 44:25.148
I'm writing to the—he wrote to me, the president of the Miniature Book Society.

44:25.168 --> 44:26.930
He has—he needs one.

44:26.970 --> 44:29.473
I'm going—I'm writing to him and telling him what I had.

44:30.554 --> 44:32.877
He can have it if he doesn't have it.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.319
Now this—this is interesting.

44:35.520 --> 44:41.607
This came from David Lowe in England, 1956.

44:42.835 --> 44:52.968
exhibited at the Silk Exposition Earl Hall, Stratford, opened by the Duchess of York, March 4, 1895.

44:53.229 --> 44:56.633
This must be on silk, of course.

44:56.653 --> 45:03.943
Specimens of needlework from the female model school in Dublin worked in 1839.

45:03.983 --> 45:09.050
This is a minister's card for the exhibition.

45:09.070 --> 45:09.811
He sent it.

45:09.831 --> 45:11.593
Now, this is a book.

45:12.130 --> 45:13.051
because it's printed.

45:13.292 --> 45:16.796
Oh, look at this.

45:16.816 --> 45:17.237
Dublin.

45:20.040 --> 45:25.327
These are samples of different types of needlework.

45:25.347 --> 45:26.529
There's buttonholes.

45:26.609 --> 45:28.011
Here's a cuff.

45:28.151 --> 45:29.713
Yeah.

45:30.334 --> 45:30.935
Yeah.

45:30.955 --> 45:34.219
Pick a shirt off.

45:34.880 --> 45:40.247
I didn't say some chrome here for the other stuff, but...

45:40.480 --> 45:46.108
I don't know, that's probably... Isn't that great for the best?

45:49.293 --> 45:52.918
Yeah, and then there's the patching.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.584
There's a patch in here, there's a patch here.

45:59.849 --> 46:00.790
Here's a gore.

46:04.075 --> 46:08.361
And it's all put together in a little shirt, you know?

46:08.746 --> 46:10.548
Everything is put together in this church.

46:10.708 --> 46:11.930
One little girl.

46:11.950 --> 46:12.791
One girl.

46:12.951 --> 46:14.954
How do we know that?

46:15.054 --> 46:16.956
It's in there somewhere.

46:16.976 --> 46:18.818
One girl did that.

46:18.838 --> 46:19.439
Well, I suppose.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.462
Well, a whole class of girls.

46:21.482 --> 46:22.683
Oh, a whole class.

46:22.763 --> 46:23.304
I see.

46:23.364 --> 46:25.907
I suppose they bought the book and then they made the samples.

46:26.428 --> 46:27.469
That's how they graduated.

46:27.489 --> 46:29.011
You had to tell me to do it.

46:29.031 --> 46:30.813
I've never seen another one of those.

46:30.873 --> 46:34.938
Then when you made that little shirt, you put it back in the box.

46:35.038 --> 46:38.162
No, I put it back in the envelope.

46:38.648 --> 46:41.855
No, I don't click.

46:43.980 --> 46:45.563
This is what happens.

46:45.643 --> 46:50.193
Things can disappear while I'm looking at them.

46:52.177 --> 46:54.362
There will be a whole place of little girls.

46:54.528 --> 47:12.672
I have no particular interest in music, but I can read a dealer's catalog devoted to music and find an oddity.

47:13.172 --> 47:14.494
There's music for the blind.

47:15.616 --> 47:16.136
Look at this.

47:16.537 --> 47:17.498
This is pre-braille.

47:18.035 --> 47:29.188
And here's music in Ray's notes.

47:29.208 --> 47:34.413
And to me that's an oddity of the sort that Walter Hart Blumenthal wrote about.

47:34.814 --> 47:41.241
Now we're getting to the Mr. Blumenthal.

47:41.592 --> 47:45.777
There it goes, and I have a lot of other things to show you if you want to see them.

47:45.817 --> 47:49.781
Well, I'm interested in getting to your acquisition of the Blumenthal collection, too.

47:49.841 --> 47:57.530
Well, I don't know how I heard about, well, the book we heard about.

47:57.550 --> 48:00.774
I bought a copy of the book, and I'm going to ask you to sign my copy of that book.

48:00.794 --> 48:01.595
How do you like that?

48:01.995 --> 48:02.976
Have you done that before?

48:03.196 --> 48:05.659
Your copy is in better condition than mine.

48:05.719 --> 48:08.002
Well, I'd probably take mine.

48:09.303 --> 48:09.624
Yeah.

48:09.744 --> 48:09.844
Yeah.

48:11.242 --> 48:38.380
i thought about you a week ago i didn't know about you do you know that yeah i paid five dollars for this from dawson's in los angeles and we're talking price i paid from bob fleck 65 dollars yeah but i must say it's in pretty nice shape i saw that listed on a recent catalog that's like well that's the one i got well okay i just got it last week now here is the uh article uh

48:39.018 --> 48:40.320
I don't know if you want to copy this.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.181
We can make a zero.

48:41.201 --> 48:41.682
I'd love to.

48:41.842 --> 48:44.225
That would help.

48:45.567 --> 48:46.167
Yeah, great.

48:47.089 --> 48:47.729
Can we do that?

48:47.750 --> 48:48.250
Do you think?

48:48.270 --> 48:48.831
Can we do that?

48:50.994 --> 48:51.274
Super.

48:51.294 --> 48:55.540
So, about the same time... Let me just put this on your desk here.

48:56.080 --> 49:01.748
About the same time the Groyer Club... Yeah, you're a member of the Groyer Club?

49:02.008 --> 49:04.031
Yeah.

49:04.051 --> 49:05.213
This is before.

49:05.233 --> 49:08.277
I've been a member of Groyer for about 20 years.

49:08.357 --> 49:08.637
Mm-hmm.

49:09.815 --> 49:14.760
And I'm probably their least prestigious member.

49:15.761 --> 49:16.882
I don't know.

49:17.342 --> 49:18.864
You're getting in my book.

49:23.228 --> 49:27.152
They had an exhibit of what I call strange and unusual.

49:28.733 --> 49:33.197
I went there, I spent a long time, and I copied down, and I made a list of everything they had.

49:34.478 --> 49:36.280
And this is again about the 50s, right?

49:36.520 --> 49:38.202
Yeah, I would think so.

49:39.532 --> 49:42.336
I have a copy of that list someplace around.

49:42.356 --> 49:44.279
I looked for it last night, and I couldn't find it.

49:44.499 --> 49:46.222
Oh, I can call the grill, yeah, don't tell me.

49:46.242 --> 49:57.619
And then along came Blumenthal's book, and I was fascinated by this, just as you were.

49:57.679 --> 50:01.585
A book shaped like the state of Georgia in an octet in Korean.

50:03.228 --> 50:08.155
So I contacted Blumenthal, who I have since found out was

50:08.422 --> 50:14.429
apparently a rich man's son, and he dabbled in books, both collecting and selling.

50:15.250 --> 50:19.896
He had a shop, I understand, up around Columbus Circle in New York.

50:20.597 --> 50:21.338
He was a New Yorker?

50:21.818 --> 50:23.921
Heart Bookshop, H-A-R-T.

50:24.161 --> 50:25.703
I really don't know much about it.

50:25.723 --> 50:26.544
Oh, you know what?

50:26.664 --> 50:28.807
Fleck told me he's from Philadelphia, come to think of it.

50:28.887 --> 50:34.834
Well, he lived at the, but certainly when he had the shop in New York, he was from Philadelphia.

50:35.827 --> 50:43.617
He looked at the Drake Hotel in Philadelphia, which is just up on Rittenhouse Square, as I recall.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.921
So I contacted him.

50:46.941 --> 50:53.990
He was an old man then, and I proposed that he sell his collection to me.

50:54.451 --> 50:55.733
I was brash.

50:55.753 --> 50:58.156
I had no idea of what he had or what he'd charge.

50:58.196 --> 51:00.699
You were charmed by the book, obviously.

51:00.719 --> 51:05.445
So he sent me a list.

51:05.948 --> 51:10.513
And to my surprise, there were only about 50 items on the list.

51:10.613 --> 51:11.774
He kept them in a bank vault.

51:13.597 --> 51:14.357
In Philadelphia?

51:14.638 --> 51:15.459
In Philadelphia.

51:15.479 --> 51:17.681
So I made an offer.

51:20.104 --> 51:24.088
I have to guess about the amount, because this goes back to 1956.

51:26.030 --> 51:27.412
So it's right after the book came out.

51:28.013 --> 51:30.836
Yeah.

51:30.856 --> 51:32.918
I can check the date.

51:34.838 --> 51:36.940
I think probably I offered him about $300.

51:36.980 --> 51:42.926
Well, you keep in mind, this was a long time ago, you know.

51:42.946 --> 51:45.108
And he turned me down.

51:48.091 --> 52:03.867
So about two years later, a very top dealer in Los Angeles by the name of Harry Levinson, I don't know whether he's still around or not, but he contacted me and offered me

52:04.403 --> 52:14.797
the Blumenthal collection of blockadities for less money than Blumenthal that I had offered to Blumenthal directly.

52:14.857 --> 52:16.339
For less than $300, then?

52:16.599 --> 52:16.840
Yeah.

52:17.360 --> 52:20.004
I'd say it was maybe $250.

52:20.144 --> 52:21.286
I'm not sure.

52:21.306 --> 52:21.486
Wow.

52:21.586 --> 52:23.128
I could check this out.

52:23.188 --> 52:26.412
That's one of the great bargains of all time.

52:26.432 --> 52:28.275
So after a while, they came.

52:28.956 --> 52:34.343
So I went through the box like a monkey looking for fleas.

52:35.572 --> 52:38.216
And there were two books missing.

52:40.099 --> 52:46.729
So I telephoned Levinson and said, gee, you know, there are two books missing.

52:46.749 --> 52:48.151
Well, he said, how do you know that?

52:49.874 --> 52:51.276
Well, I said, I have a list.

52:51.296 --> 52:53.379
I said, you, that Blumenthal gave me.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.803
I said, you quoted the Blumenthal collection.

52:57.025 --> 52:58.447
And I know it was in the collection.

52:58.507 --> 52:59.829
Oh, he said, I didn't know that.

52:59.870 --> 53:02.153
He said, you won't have any trouble finding those.

53:02.808 --> 53:05.271
Of course, years later, I still haven't found them.

53:05.351 --> 53:07.173
He carry-picked, you see.

53:07.193 --> 53:07.714
I see.

53:07.854 --> 53:09.395
But he only left two, thank goodness.

53:09.415 --> 53:11.498
Well, it's a book story, you know.

53:11.738 --> 53:16.443
It's one of the things that sort of makes fun of collecting them.

53:16.463 --> 53:17.605
It makes it fun.

53:17.905 --> 53:18.666
It makes it fun.

53:18.686 --> 53:19.307
Not fun of, I think.

53:19.327 --> 53:20.108
No, no, no.

53:20.288 --> 53:21.049
It makes fun.

53:22.811 --> 53:23.712
It's fun to collect.

53:23.732 --> 53:24.352
Makes it fun.

53:24.372 --> 53:25.173
Yeah, it makes it fun.

53:26.335 --> 53:29.338
And you end up with these little stories, like...

53:30.297 --> 53:32.239
Norman Strauss collected Mosier.

53:32.259 --> 53:33.880
That's how I got to know him.

53:35.302 --> 53:39.425
And, uh, so I'm collecting Hearn.

53:39.445 --> 53:49.695
So, uh, Ellen Schaefer, I meet her in Dawson's, where she worked, and I got Creole cookbook from her.

53:49.755 --> 53:52.337
Now she's up at Norman Strauss.

53:52.738 --> 53:54.199
It's a wonderful place.

53:54.219 --> 53:56.501
My wife and I drove up there two years ago.

53:56.521 --> 53:58.583
I went there once, and, uh,

53:59.491 --> 54:04.419
She wasn't there when I was there, and of course, he had a stroke or something.

54:04.439 --> 54:04.779
He's not well.

54:05.180 --> 54:06.622
Everybody says he's not well.

54:07.944 --> 54:13.914
But he has a collection of Moser's, and he bought, when Moser's collection was sold at auction, he bought a lot of them.

54:13.994 --> 54:17.680
He has a lot of the vellum copies.

54:17.900 --> 54:23.609
Moser did a few copies of everything he did on vellum, like three or four or five or six.

54:24.831 --> 54:27.355
And Norman Strauss has a number of those I understand.

54:30.575 --> 54:39.404
So then I started looking for odd things, meanwhile continuing other collections.

54:39.424 --> 54:48.613
But the problem with collecting an author is that you get up to a point and then you get stuck.

54:49.734 --> 54:55.019
Like with, for 50 years I haven't been able to finish Frank Stockton.

54:55.039 --> 54:59.383
And the same with any author collection or any press collection.

55:00.190 --> 55:03.573
But with book oddities, it's endless.

55:03.633 --> 55:06.336
There's no bibliography.

55:06.356 --> 55:09.859
There are hundreds of odd things.

55:09.879 --> 55:14.403
And I think I'm the only one collecting book oddities.

55:15.104 --> 55:16.125
That's great.

55:16.145 --> 55:19.248
And so that has some advantage.

55:19.648 --> 55:22.231
And content is quite irrelevant to the collection, too.

55:22.431 --> 55:23.832
Yeah, yeah.

55:23.852 --> 55:27.936
And it's endless, and yet the collection is complete at any time.

55:28.203 --> 55:30.947
show you my collection of book oddities, you see?

55:32.088 --> 55:34.411
And you can't say where is this or where is that?

55:34.431 --> 55:37.715
When I talk to you about Stockton, I have to say, well, there's one item.

55:37.735 --> 55:39.017
So it's your definition.

55:39.457 --> 55:41.039
You basically set the rules.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.463
It's what strikes you as odd.

55:43.843 --> 55:48.349
I have no definition of a book oddity.

55:48.369 --> 55:52.795
I find it very hard to explain this to dealers.

55:52.815 --> 55:54.717
I have written hundreds of letters

55:56.705 --> 55:59.629
And very seldom do I get a quote.

56:02.853 --> 56:04.215
Here are oddities.

56:04.235 --> 56:06.298
I started keeping track in 1983.

56:06.318 --> 56:13.247
And these are, you know, here's Helkins and Matthews and Spinkinson.

56:13.287 --> 56:14.569
Here's Barry McKay.

56:14.589 --> 56:15.390
They're all in England.

56:16.271 --> 56:17.633
Alma Harrison.

56:17.933 --> 56:20.416
Here's Chloe's in Sacramento, California.

56:20.436 --> 56:23.320
Charles Wood.

56:24.565 --> 56:28.149
He's still around, isn't he?

56:28.169 --> 56:28.409
Yeah, he is.

56:28.430 --> 56:29.491
He was down in the village.

56:29.571 --> 56:31.073
The Turn Press in England.

56:31.093 --> 56:34.336
On and on, Shorey's in Seattle.

56:34.917 --> 56:42.466
I've written every one of these dealers about my interest in collecting odd things.

56:43.467 --> 56:45.389
And hardly ever do I hear from them.

56:45.409 --> 56:47.732
Look at page after page of letters.

56:47.932 --> 56:50.235
Each one I write individually.

56:51.633 --> 56:53.015
So you have to find these books.

56:53.095 --> 56:56.380
They're not about to propose something.

56:56.420 --> 57:14.725
Yeah, and October 5th, I wrote to a guy, the Costers in Selden, Long Island, Peter Scott in Stone Ridge, New York, and John Sanderson in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

57:14.985 --> 57:19.131
I'm going to keep my eyes open for you now, because I do see tons of books.

57:19.151 --> 57:20.813
They're the kind of letters I wrote.

57:21.333 --> 57:25.399
Thank you for sending catalogs, so-and-so, fastening, erudite production.

57:25.499 --> 57:28.203
Congratulations to whomever was the author.

57:28.323 --> 57:33.090
As a collector of many years standing, I learns and so on, you know?

57:33.110 --> 57:33.310
Uh-huh.

57:33.450 --> 57:37.235
And I talk about the things I collect and book oddities.

57:37.636 --> 57:42.022
But whoever wrote back to you and said, I don't feel much in nutty books.

57:42.042 --> 57:42.242
Yeah.

57:42.643 --> 57:43.604
Somebody knew that?

57:43.624 --> 57:44.225
Yeah, nutty books.

57:44.245 --> 57:51.255
Maybe they are nutty books.

57:55.252 --> 57:56.688
Let me show you.

57:56.708 --> 57:58.326
Okay.
