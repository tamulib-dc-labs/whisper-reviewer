WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:05.929
with Ethan Cannon for his wonderful new collection of stories.

00:06.810 --> 00:16.444
Tell me a little bit about your practicing medicine.

00:17.305 --> 00:27.439
Clearly you haven't... I mean, Michael Crichton, for instance, went to Harvard Medical School, and he has found...

00:27.605 --> 00:31.829
I was thrilled.

00:33.171 --> 00:35.754
I was just at Politics and Prose in Washington, D.C.

00:35.774 --> 00:39.057
I think it's the only bookstore in the country where I'm ahead of Michael Crichton on the bestseller list.

00:39.077 --> 00:39.478
No kidding.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.499
He's five and I'm three.

00:40.579 --> 00:41.159
I took a picture.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.040
Now, where is this?

00:42.441 --> 00:43.542
It's called Politics and Prose.

00:43.562 --> 00:43.902
That's right.

00:43.982 --> 00:44.763
It's a store in Washington.

00:45.364 --> 00:46.265
Yeah, it's my solo store.

00:46.685 --> 00:48.167
I took a picture pointing at it.

00:49.328 --> 00:50.669
How is the book doing, by the way?

00:50.729 --> 00:51.450
I think it's doing well.

00:51.490 --> 00:55.114
Actually, I'm not trying to get it on the bestseller list.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.656
I don't know if it'll make that, but it's doing well.

00:58.297 --> 01:00.099
What was the first printing?

01:00.900 --> 01:01.341
I don't know.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.963
It's in the second printing now.

01:03.083 --> 01:03.263
Good.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.484
I don't ask those things.

01:04.504 --> 01:05.365
I don't want to know.

01:05.506 --> 01:06.707
Because whatever it is, it's too small.

01:07.047 --> 01:13.275
I'm curious about pursuing this dual career.

01:13.795 --> 01:16.018
Is this something that you think you're going to... Yeah.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.742
Because I can't do either one by itself.

01:19.762 --> 01:21.945
It's too depressing just to write.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.383
Is it really?

01:23.403 --> 01:23.884
I find it.

01:23.924 --> 01:26.727
Well, you're by yourself all day.

01:28.009 --> 01:32.575
You know, you wake up in the morning, you tap away.

01:32.655 --> 01:34.998
You wake up in the morning, you tap away.

01:35.018 --> 01:36.980
You come blinking out into the light in the afternoon.

01:37.621 --> 01:38.842
Everybody else is coming home from work.

01:38.862 --> 01:39.804
You're just getting out of the house.

01:40.705 --> 01:42.968
But if it's depressing, what motivates you to write?

01:43.508 --> 01:44.129
Hard to say.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.571
I just have to do it.

01:46.732 --> 01:51.158
Saw Bella's line about a writer being a reader moved to emulation.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.219
Whenever I read, I want to write.

01:52.587 --> 02:22.273
and it's sort of unquenchable it keeps coming back you know each time I finish a story I think well that's the last story I'll ever write I mean there are no medical themes at all here so you really have divided yourself yeah well medicine is not that fictional to me you know it's such a strange environment especially if you're in it you know it's just weird using a strange Latin language all the time in these kind of

02:22.760 --> 02:25.785
It's just a strange culture.

02:25.905 --> 02:27.387
It's pretending to be a science.

02:27.407 --> 02:30.812
It sort of denies its human side all the time.

02:32.174 --> 02:34.198
It pretends it can quantify.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.120
Even the word quantify is a real word.

02:36.641 --> 02:44.774
It pretends it can count all this stuff up and sort of lump character in some kind of analysis.

02:46.657 --> 02:50.843
The only way there's similar writing in medicine is that I think if you're interested...

02:51.903 --> 02:55.527
in writing, you would be interested in medicine, be interested in seeing people.

02:57.429 --> 03:06.999
You know, and you hear these unbelievable stories from people at the end of their lives, you know, things that you can't imagine.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.664
You told me you had something interesting to say about the How We Die book.

03:11.724 --> 03:12.705
Oh, yeah.

03:12.905 --> 03:14.827
Well, it's probably, it can't be on the record.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.148
Okay.

03:16.549 --> 03:17.910
Off the record.

03:18.130 --> 03:18.371
Yeah.

03:18.671 --> 03:19.632
Just push the button.

03:22.227 --> 03:23.448
Okay.

03:23.588 --> 03:25.490
We won't talk that much about the medicine.

03:26.070 --> 03:28.653
Do you have a thought about specialties?

03:28.813 --> 03:33.157
Yeah, either emergency medicine or primary care or psychiatry.

03:33.537 --> 03:38.481
Psychiatry might be the one for a writer.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.563
Yeah, I mean, it would be.

03:41.384 --> 03:47.429
The problem is that we'd probably be tempted to write about the things I hear, which is sort of, I don't know.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.672
Do you feel that you'll probably stay in San Francisco?

03:50.812 --> 03:51.913
Yeah, I think so.

03:52.383 --> 03:54.346
You're from that area, right?

03:54.366 --> 04:00.397
Well, I lived in Ohio for us when I was a kid and in Pennsylvania, but then I moved to San Francisco in my childhood, too.

04:00.637 --> 04:01.779
Yeah, so I've been living out there.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.906
And Barbara, by the way, what's her surname?

04:06.648 --> 04:08.611
Schuller, S-C-H-U-L-E-R.

04:08.731 --> 04:11.356
Do you mind if I mention that in the Quincy piece?

04:11.416 --> 04:13.099
No, I would love to have it in the Quincy piece.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.862
It would be nice.

04:15.503 --> 04:16.224
It's great for me.

04:16.945 --> 04:17.867
I'm really trying to.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.421
catered to what they want.

04:20.481 --> 04:20.902
Right.

04:21.622 --> 04:23.324
Oh, yeah, she'd love to be mentioned in the ledger.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.447
In fact, I would love to get a copy of that to give to her.

04:26.748 --> 04:30.672
Well, just tell me where your address is, and I'll send you all the clips, I guess.

04:30.692 --> 04:31.693
That'd be great.

04:31.713 --> 04:32.293
Okay.

04:34.676 --> 04:40.802
When you started, did you start this as a collection, or did you start these as a... I started this as a relief when I was writing a novel that hit the wall.

04:41.643 --> 04:45.407
I wrote about 150 pages, and I didn't know what to do.

04:46.348 --> 04:47.229
I was trying to plot.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.630
I thought I needed a plot.

04:49.353 --> 04:51.535
and then also before I got past about page 200.

04:52.356 --> 04:55.158
You know, I always write just kind of groping around, see what happens.

04:55.218 --> 05:01.243
And this got to about 150 pages, and I was still groping around on day one of these characters' lives.

05:02.284 --> 05:06.427
So I figured I'd take a break and write a couple stories.

05:06.447 --> 05:08.529
And I just discovered this link.

05:09.190 --> 05:14.354
It was utterly coincidental or something that all of them, all of them, other than about probably a thousand words of each other.

05:14.914 --> 05:15.455
Okay.

05:15.535 --> 05:16.576
Yeah.

05:16.596 --> 05:17.517
It wasn't intentional.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.258
What are they about, each one?

05:19.508 --> 05:22.552
I actually don't know the word count.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.514
They're about 80 pages typed.

05:24.534 --> 05:25.054
So what's that?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.316
Maybe 20,000 words?

05:27.197 --> 05:28.338
No, it's less than that.

05:28.358 --> 05:31.262
Maybe 15,000 words each.

05:31.522 --> 05:32.463
How many pages typed?

05:33.024 --> 05:33.704
About 80.

05:33.724 --> 05:37.269
15, 70, 80.

05:37.309 --> 05:37.889
Maybe 20.

05:38.890 --> 05:41.774
I think the whole book is somewhere in the range of 65 or something like that.

05:41.794 --> 05:44.777
Which one did you start first?

05:45.979 --> 05:48.081
Accountant.

05:49.968 --> 05:51.230
Or else Batchelor Zaganzaro.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.933
I remember I started Batchelor Zaganzaro.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.956
Which are probably the two strongest stories.

05:56.258 --> 05:58.282
I originally thought Palace Thief was the strongest story.

05:58.722 --> 05:59.443
Now I don't know.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.210
Accountant maybe is the strongest.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.071
Why is that?

06:04.251 --> 06:06.134
Now did you pick that as the title?

06:06.375 --> 06:08.518
I guess it's better for a book.

06:08.658 --> 06:12.685
I actually kind of liked Accountant.

06:12.968 --> 06:17.635
Random House, but now I've got to be thrilled with that.

06:17.695 --> 06:18.396
That's a grabber.

06:19.197 --> 06:22.042
That's a great story.

06:22.122 --> 06:23.744
You got the voice perfectly.

06:24.005 --> 06:26.088
Yeah, that was easy to write.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.612
Just wrote that, start to finish.

06:29.072 --> 06:29.793
Just tapped it out.

06:30.174 --> 06:38.166
I guess what's impressing, so many critics, people who read and really pay attention to things like voices and characters,

06:38.753 --> 06:46.445
Is the way you're able to really, I mean, what are you, 32, 33, 33 now?

06:46.465 --> 06:53.956
To just project the voice of a guy in his 50s, or a palace thief, a fellow 68, 69, whatever he is.

06:54.357 --> 06:57.902
Which is embarrassing, because all I'm doing is talking, these are just my own voices.

06:57.922 --> 06:58.363
Really?

06:58.383 --> 07:00.406
Yeah.

07:00.446 --> 07:01.067
Makes me think of.

07:02.068 --> 07:06.215
Well, these are just shades of your own voices?

07:06.235 --> 07:07.056
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.272 --> 07:10.335
Just parts of my own voice sort of pulled out and exaggerated.

07:11.176 --> 07:12.037
How do you do that?

07:13.639 --> 07:15.181
Can you see what these are?

07:15.201 --> 07:18.405
I have a vision of what these people look like, and you describe them.

07:18.905 --> 07:19.206
Do you?

07:20.787 --> 07:28.977
You know, I realize I have memories that I'm crawling on, only because yesterday someone mentioned somebody I knew, and I realized when I was picturing the accountant, I was picturing him.

07:30.538 --> 07:32.461
A guy I knew in medical school, you know, he was like 21.

07:32.641 --> 07:35.524
He always carried a briefcase.

07:36.803 --> 07:39.506
sort of walked with his shoulders, pulled in, and his hand to the side.

07:44.651 --> 07:53.620
To write a story, you can think of a million situations, but if you can think of a situation and a voice together, then you can write a story.

07:53.640 --> 08:01.728
I mean, there are a lot of writers who find the writing of stories a lot harder than writing novels.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.169
I find it the other way around.

08:03.229 --> 08:06.152
I find this is the best length.

08:07.212 --> 08:11.217
You know, because you can get into some character.

08:13.179 --> 08:21.148
I guess what I like to do is get enough character in there so that some little tiny small action takes on a huge significance.

08:21.168 --> 08:21.929
That's what I was trying to do.

08:21.949 --> 08:25.212
I mean, anybody can write a good story about the fall of civilization.

08:25.272 --> 08:31.680
Not the fall of civilization, but anybody can write a good story about death or something like that.

08:32.941 --> 08:34.603
You can make something good about something small.

08:34.837 --> 08:44.711
I mean, there is an underlying status in not just these stories, but I would say now in the body of your work.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.053
I mean, where is this coming from?

08:46.073 --> 08:46.794
You're a young guy.

08:47.254 --> 08:48.777
I've always been sad.

08:51.020 --> 08:51.741
Where is it coming from?

08:51.761 --> 08:52.021
I don't know.

08:52.081 --> 08:52.902
It's coming from a generation.

08:52.922 --> 08:56.988
I mean, there's a sense of futility for all these, at the City of Broken Dreams.

08:57.409 --> 09:04.118
Even the accountant taking that, taking the socks, you know, I mean, it's very,

09:04.722 --> 09:07.485
thing that he did, isn't it?

09:07.625 --> 09:07.925
Yeah.

09:07.945 --> 09:12.570
I mean, he blew this big deal because he went up on the page.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.212
What a great story.

09:14.492 --> 09:19.177
And I really didn't think that that other story was going to be an age story.

09:19.377 --> 09:21.359
I mean, that's right on the last page.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.382
Did you project this as that?

09:24.442 --> 09:25.483
No, it would have happened.

09:26.224 --> 09:33.531
No, the age thing, I just stumbled into it later.

09:33.967 --> 09:37.472
I actually wrote that story with the second-to-last paragraph was the first thing I wrote.

09:37.992 --> 09:38.473
Is that right?

09:38.713 --> 09:40.335
I think it's the second-to-last paragraph.

09:40.476 --> 09:41.637
It's when they discover them.

09:41.978 --> 09:45.682
It was before I had any... I wasn't thinking about AIDS.

09:46.604 --> 09:46.924
Yeah.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.688
I just... Right.

09:49.708 --> 09:50.549
Second-to-last paragraph.

09:51.310 --> 09:54.013
See, but you... So then you get nasty.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.176
You decided to kill them off.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.999
There you go.

09:58.019 --> 09:58.399
There you go.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.223
But, I mean, you know, 73, I mean...

10:02.418 --> 10:04.902
It was hip about everything except homosexuality.

10:05.523 --> 10:11.812
It was still having quite an acceptable thing.

10:14.336 --> 10:19.143
Chris, I was wondering if there was something from the old Navy thing, you know, too many years at sea.

10:19.224 --> 10:22.869
A lot of things happened at sea.

10:23.009 --> 10:26.695
I'm wondering if maybe the father was carrying some baggage there.

10:26.775 --> 10:27.316
I didn't know.

10:27.656 --> 10:28.678
Yeah, I mean, he does hit them.

10:28.996 --> 10:34.926
You know, who knows if there's something... I was actually thinking of writing that, making that into a novel, and that would have been an interesting thing.

10:34.946 --> 10:35.226
Really?

10:35.607 --> 10:38.171
It would be very... You could probably still do something.

10:38.191 --> 10:38.892
Yeah, I was thinking that.

10:38.952 --> 10:40.515
The only problem is now people know the end.

10:41.537 --> 10:43.079
Well, yeah.

10:44.061 --> 10:50.531
I mean, Philip Watt has changed his... Zuckerman has been through any different... Right.

10:50.551 --> 10:51.433
But that would be interesting.

10:51.453 --> 10:53.316
I mean, why would he be so angry?

10:54.899 --> 11:00.585
You do give us a sense of foreboding at the very beginning of that story, the year that changed our lives.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.228
Right.

11:03.248 --> 11:04.189
Well, it's funny to read this.

11:04.269 --> 11:05.390
I read this story out loud.

11:05.470 --> 11:10.496
So far it's the only one I've been reading on my tour because it's the only one you can read out loud.

11:12.077 --> 11:15.561
Because the others don't get good until about page 60 and you can't read for two hours.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.042
What do you do when I'm reading?

11:17.583 --> 11:19.305
I just read about 15 pages of that.

11:19.745 --> 11:20.386
It's hard.

11:20.406 --> 11:24.130
I wish there were some crowd of

11:24.532 --> 11:28.836
who want to hear us in two hours.

11:29.057 --> 11:32.220
I'd like to read a whole story at some point, but I could never do it.

11:33.741 --> 11:39.207
I'm the president of the Friends of the Goddard Library of Clark, and we had a book and authored in him.

11:39.227 --> 11:41.449
We had Richard Marrius from Harvard.

11:41.469 --> 11:43.071
I just saw him yesterday.

11:43.111 --> 11:49.577
He was supposed to talk for 20 minutes, and he read from his novel for about 40 minutes.

11:49.861 --> 11:54.066
I mean, they were looking at me with these eyes.

11:54.086 --> 11:54.867
This is off the record.

11:54.887 --> 11:56.870
I don't want to repeat this, but Justin Kaplan.

11:59.173 --> 12:00.094
He's quite a talker.

12:01.015 --> 12:05.801
But really, when he was talking about it growing up, it was wonderful, but then he started to read.

12:06.822 --> 12:07.743
Is that right?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.587
I'm just pleased to see it.

12:11.275 --> 12:12.797
You haven't seen it in a while, I mean.

12:12.817 --> 12:13.678
They broke the record.

12:13.878 --> 12:14.499
Yeah, 89.3.

12:14.519 --> 12:15.521
89.3.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.203
Actually, let's keep going.

12:17.343 --> 12:17.804
Yeah.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.585
Let's go for it.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.746
Let's shatter the record.

12:19.966 --> 12:21.969
I've never seen so much snow here.

12:21.989 --> 12:23.892
I really thought that was an invented language.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.416
Now, this actually, I don't want to give anything away in my piece.

12:27.436 --> 12:27.797
Right.

12:28.277 --> 12:29.239
Yeah, it's actually Hungarian.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.343
And there's an actual meaning to what they say to each other.

12:32.383 --> 12:33.424
Oh, there is.

12:33.444 --> 12:34.686
Did you tell me?

12:35.367 --> 12:35.987
Yeah, I'll tell you.

12:36.208 --> 12:40.253
Well, what they say at the end, batrzag means love and zarla means courage.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.600
So that's what they're saying to each other when they discover it.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.201
That's terrific.

12:44.221 --> 12:44.521
Yeah.

12:44.741 --> 12:45.743
I didn't want to tell anybody that.

12:45.763 --> 12:48.386
I thought only people who discover it can know that.

12:48.506 --> 12:49.687
I won't put it in.

12:49.707 --> 12:51.990
I think, actually, I forget which is which.

12:52.010 --> 12:52.390
Dr. Zahn.

12:52.631 --> 12:53.352
Well, one of them is love.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.193
One of them is courage.

12:55.234 --> 12:55.654
Do me a favor.

12:55.674 --> 12:56.175
Don't put that in.

12:56.195 --> 12:56.716
I won't.

12:56.976 --> 13:02.823
I just, I actually thought that they were in, but you really, I'm very good at this.

13:03.564 --> 13:04.705
I get suckered on this.

13:05.815 --> 13:07.758
You see, but the girl was there.

13:08.239 --> 13:09.601
Right.

13:09.621 --> 13:13.006
But she seduces the younger brother because she's not getting it from the older brother.

13:13.026 --> 13:13.907
Yeah, but we don't know that.

13:15.289 --> 13:15.930
Right.

13:15.950 --> 13:16.831
Why is she there?

13:16.851 --> 13:20.156
I mean, that's a pretty elaborate beard that the guy's wearing.

13:20.256 --> 13:25.644
I mean, he sets her up in the house and he doesn't want anybody to know, but he really wants the mother to know.

13:26.045 --> 13:27.687
The mother knows that she's down there.

13:27.747 --> 13:29.670
I assume he may know the father.

13:29.710 --> 13:30.912
She says the father doesn't know.

13:30.932 --> 13:31.853
The father doesn't know.

13:31.873 --> 13:32.494
The mother knows.

13:33.235 --> 13:34.337
The mother figures it out.

13:34.975 --> 13:53.639
It's funny, reading this story, you know, I always write my story, I never know how they're going to end, but when I read it out loud, I realize that, God, so much of it makes, I must have noticed, you know, the whole time, because so much of it makes retrospective sense, you know, all these things.

13:56.663 --> 13:59.727
See, Elliot should have been the clue.

13:59.747 --> 14:03.091
He should have been, just the presence of the friend should have been the clue.

14:03.311 --> 14:03.852
He should have been

14:04.270 --> 14:06.392
I'm mad that I didn't pick up on it.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.174
I'm glad you didn't pick up on it.

14:08.194 --> 14:13.479
Well, I mean, I told Scott Thoreau, I thought figuring out, uh, was easy.

14:13.499 --> 14:14.560
I figured it out right away.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.281
It was so easy.

14:15.301 --> 14:16.623
As soon as I saw the spermicide early on.

14:16.643 --> 14:26.232
Well, you're a physician, but I mean, I, as a former investigative reporter, know that as soon as, if there are records of phone calls being made from your phone, well, there's no mistake there.

14:26.252 --> 14:26.493
Right.

14:26.793 --> 14:29.516
Either he made them, the narrator, or somebody in the house made them.

14:29.576 --> 14:29.856
Right.

14:30.022 --> 14:30.463
Easy.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.123
The wife did it.

14:31.183 --> 14:31.524
Exactly.

14:32.004 --> 14:32.164
Right.

14:32.345 --> 14:32.805
No problem.

14:32.825 --> 14:33.546
You told her on that?

14:33.906 --> 14:34.407
Yeah, I did.

14:34.527 --> 14:36.670
And he said, well, one out of four.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.131
I said, figure it out.

14:38.512 --> 14:38.912
Is that right?

14:38.932 --> 14:39.172
Yeah.

14:39.293 --> 14:40.434
Three out of four never got it.

14:41.175 --> 14:42.296
Takes nothing away from it.

14:42.696 --> 14:43.317
Right.

14:43.337 --> 14:46.421
But it was, you know, he thought that he was giving too much of it.

14:46.501 --> 14:48.043
It's a good book.

14:48.063 --> 14:48.783
I love that book.

14:48.803 --> 14:53.829
I actually taught that in my, when I taught writing at the University of Iowa, it's one of the books I used to teach.

14:53.849 --> 14:54.550
Is that right?

14:54.590 --> 14:55.131
Yeah.

14:55.151 --> 14:58.915
His last book was very interesting, too, because the detective is a bad guy.

14:59.671 --> 15:00.252
I didn't read it.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.713
He takes the money in rent.

15:02.013 --> 15:02.293
Right.

15:02.333 --> 15:06.257
Is that a burden of proofs?

15:06.718 --> 15:07.718
Whatever the title is.

15:08.139 --> 15:12.643
You know, these titles, all these derivative titles, you have to be crazy.

15:12.723 --> 15:16.166
Like Joe McGinnis' Fatal Vision, Blind Fade, this one.

15:16.226 --> 15:17.107
Right.

15:17.147 --> 15:20.010
There are only a certain number of words.

15:20.030 --> 15:21.151
I like to tell her speak.

15:22.832 --> 15:27.056
Tell me about, now, you had trouble with the novel, or you were blocked with the novel?

15:27.136 --> 15:28.918
This novel right now.

15:29.236 --> 15:38.868
I wanted to write this sort of 40-year thing about some kids in western Massachusetts who then become adults.

15:39.288 --> 15:43.573
Something bad happens to them in their childhood, and then how they deal with it as adults.

15:44.154 --> 15:53.005
But I wrote 150 pages, and they're not getting past the first day of their childhood things, and I feel like that's the wrong page for a 40-year novel.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.488
Now you're 33, you told me.

15:55.508 --> 15:58.872
Where do you see, I mean, you've got three books published, all...

15:59.459 --> 16:05.225
The novel maybe wasn't regarded as highly as the stories, but you're still a kid.

16:07.428 --> 16:08.589
Where do you see this all going?

16:08.629 --> 16:10.031
I don't know.

16:10.691 --> 16:12.153
I don't really think about it that much.

16:12.694 --> 16:15.517
That's one of the reasons I'm in medicine, so I don't have to think about it that much.

16:16.418 --> 16:17.339
It takes the pressure off.

16:18.200 --> 16:18.901
What is writing?

16:19.021 --> 16:22.745
You say you just have to do it, even though so many of the stories are different.

16:22.765 --> 16:28.251
It's very hard, by the way, to do an interview on stories and fiction, I have to tell you, which is why we're dancing around.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.384
It's much easier on non-fiction, I suppose.

16:32.404 --> 16:39.491
Well, this kind of book is easy because it's, you know, the new spies and stuff like that and blah, blah, blah.

16:39.511 --> 16:43.495
But anyway, this is a much greater challenge.

16:43.875 --> 16:50.622
This will run, by the way, a week from Saturday in Quincy, and it'll run this coming Wednesday in Worcester.

16:51.522 --> 16:57.428
My Lowell thing doesn't start for another week, it takes a little bit.

16:58.049 --> 17:01.233
I wonder how the book's doing in Boston.

17:01.253 --> 17:01.654
I'm sorry?

17:01.674 --> 17:03.016
I wonder how the book's doing in Boston.

17:03.036 --> 17:03.977
I haven't really been out yet.

17:04.097 --> 17:05.078
I just got here yesterday.

17:05.098 --> 17:07.782
I know Quincy asked me to do this.

17:07.802 --> 17:08.723
I was doing it anyway.

17:10.005 --> 17:11.006
Well, that's good.

17:11.047 --> 17:12.408
Probably because of the Barbara connection.

17:12.428 --> 17:12.969
I didn't know.

17:12.989 --> 17:14.892
I mean, until this woman told me yesterday.

17:14.912 --> 17:15.593
I was telling her.

17:15.653 --> 17:17.315
I was asking if she had a picture of you.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.619
I said, well, you know, ask him about Barbara.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.443
I said, I've got a daughter of Barbara, by the way.

17:23.463 --> 17:26.768
I said, no, she was talking about Barbara.

17:26.788 --> 17:27.769
Well, yeah.

17:28.036 --> 17:35.004
No, I mean, I normally look at the dedications, but I have to say it's, anyway.

17:35.104 --> 17:39.789
Anyway, so, you're asking how I see the future.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.470
I don't know.

17:40.490 --> 17:47.779
Well, sometimes when I see, you know, when I see to be a professional writer, to be John Updike at 60, whatever he is, you have to have written 40 books, you know, I can't imagine that.

17:48.700 --> 17:54.246
I can't imagine writing 10 times what I've already written.

17:56.082 --> 17:58.825
But I hope to be able to write a book every two or three years.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.747
I think I have enough in me to do that.

18:00.868 --> 18:02.990
Where do you see it going in terms of quality of work?

18:04.031 --> 18:06.454
I want to never be afraid to change.

18:06.534 --> 18:08.016
I want to write a thriller as my next book.

18:08.056 --> 18:08.457
Really?

18:09.858 --> 18:09.958
Yeah.

18:09.978 --> 18:11.360
Which probably will kill my career.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.943
I probably won't know how to handle that.

18:13.963 --> 18:15.285
But I don't know.

18:15.305 --> 18:15.985
I just want to do that.

18:16.106 --> 18:18.929
Every time you do something new, you learn something.

18:19.490 --> 18:19.970
How about women?

18:20.911 --> 18:21.772
Women characters?

18:22.433 --> 18:22.633
Yeah.

18:23.334 --> 18:24.115
People ask me that.

18:25.715 --> 18:27.178
I'm getting more confident to do that.

18:27.618 --> 18:38.077
I went to college, you know, I was in college from 78 to 82, and we were so sort of programmed to be scared of offending women.

18:39.579 --> 18:42.044
There's this great fear that if I did that, I'd get it wrong.

18:42.244 --> 18:46.492
So I've always sort of been touchy about that.

18:46.912 --> 18:50.659
Well, again, Mary Gordon, why does she always write about

18:54.284 --> 18:56.306
She's tried.

18:56.506 --> 18:57.647
She's groped at it.

18:58.027 --> 19:01.470
The three novellas, particularly, that she really did, which I liked.

19:03.012 --> 19:04.033
I actually want to read those.

19:04.053 --> 19:04.753
I've heard they're good.

19:04.773 --> 19:05.714
They're very good.

19:05.734 --> 19:07.116
I like them.

19:07.136 --> 19:07.996
Unless you pick them up.

19:08.116 --> 19:09.958
What do they call them?

19:09.978 --> 19:12.260
You're going to have to end up transcribing all this stuff.

19:12.581 --> 19:14.362
No, don't worry about that.

19:14.382 --> 19:16.344
It's been years since I could be here.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.305
I'll go to book stories today.

19:17.325 --> 19:17.945
I'll find them.

19:17.965 --> 19:19.667
I forget, but it's pretty good.

19:20.087 --> 19:20.548
It's funny.

19:20.628 --> 19:23.110
I was just in England.

19:23.410 --> 19:24.772
They had this strange way.

19:24.792 --> 19:28.997
They called me like a bloke writer, which is like, you know, sort of Western macho.

19:29.397 --> 19:29.818
Oh, sure.

19:30.418 --> 19:34.543
Which is not what people think here, I assume.

19:35.004 --> 19:37.667
Well, what does that mean, a bloke writer?

19:38.388 --> 19:42.072
I think it means like a tough guy writer.

19:42.092 --> 19:43.414
They see you as a tough guy writer?

19:43.714 --> 19:45.176
Which I find utterly strange.

19:45.196 --> 19:45.937
Not everybody did.

19:45.957 --> 19:46.417
A couple people did.

19:46.437 --> 19:48.820
But it's utterly ridiculous.

19:49.601 --> 19:51.443
And every...

19:52.267 --> 19:55.451
But every review mentioned it must be sort of really on people's minds there.

19:56.292 --> 19:59.316
Either to say, no, he's not, or yes, he is.

19:59.857 --> 20:13.314
I think it comes from the, you know, in England, they think of American writers, they think of Richard Ford, Tom McGuane, Toby Wolfe, Raymond Carver, Barry Hanna, you know, those kind of tough dudes.

20:13.334 --> 20:14.996
They love American writers over there, don't they?

20:15.016 --> 20:15.938
Yeah, but I think they love that.

20:15.978 --> 20:19.422
They think of Americans as wearing like coonskin caps and stuff.

20:23.772 --> 20:27.578
She absolutely said she saw a difference between American fiction and British fiction.

20:27.598 --> 20:33.527
She said, in American fiction, there is often a place of always of paramount importance.

20:34.348 --> 20:36.231
That's true in Western fiction.

20:36.491 --> 20:36.832
Yeah.

20:36.852 --> 20:39.596
That's because she's reading, you know, that kind of... That's right.

20:39.817 --> 20:41.639
That's what they think of as America there.

20:41.880 --> 20:46.547
Yeah, well, she said, even if somebody's writing about Iowa, for some reason, Iowa needs to be so important.

20:46.567 --> 20:47.548
Takes a big part in that.

20:47.669 --> 20:48.890
And I said, well, what about your book?

20:48.951 --> 20:50.573
I mean, this whole thing happens.

20:52.848 --> 20:58.274
You have to have this kind of baronial state where you could really good shelter a kid from the outside world.

20:58.354 --> 21:03.680
I don't think you could do that.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.362
Tell me about baseball.

21:05.382 --> 21:06.523
It was baseball.

21:06.664 --> 21:08.366
Red Sox's metaphor here.

21:08.386 --> 21:09.086
Red Sox's metaphor.

21:09.106 --> 21:10.228
I love playing baseball.

21:10.248 --> 21:14.913
It's the thing I like more than anything else in the world is playing baseball and playing softball.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.995
You have two kind of fantasy camps here.

21:17.095 --> 21:20.239
I mean, you have the actual fantasy camp, and then the island camp.

21:21.029 --> 21:21.790
Right, right.

21:21.850 --> 21:23.753
Where they palestine, where they go.

21:23.773 --> 21:28.741
There is kind of a welcome-to-fantasy-island time.

21:28.761 --> 21:29.522
Right.

21:32.126 --> 21:34.750
I didn't realize that until later, that those stories are so similar.

21:35.752 --> 21:46.148
They are a bit similar, but I mean, there is a striving here to reach something that is perhaps unattainable.

21:46.228 --> 21:47.610
I guess it's sort of doing something

21:49.345 --> 21:50.387
I guess it's unobtainable.

21:50.407 --> 22:04.169
It's also sort of a shattering of daily restraints kind of thing, the shattering of the work-a-day kind of world, especially for this guy, the accountant, to do something like that.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.133
Well, it was a fantasy kid.

22:07.274 --> 22:08.516
I mean, it really was.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.038
He's an accountant.

22:10.619 --> 22:15.066
I mean, the encounters are, I mean, their lives are very structured.

22:15.603 --> 22:19.269
He didn't have the guts to go into business with this guy, too.

22:19.329 --> 22:21.372
He's chosen the safe path.

22:22.393 --> 22:24.797
And it's gotten him two-thirds of the way up the stairs.

22:25.618 --> 22:27.641
And then all of a sudden he has this shot.

22:27.661 --> 22:29.905
The guy really is going to give him a deal.

22:30.426 --> 22:35.974
He stole the socks and he can't open the... And it's a wonderful little thing.

22:36.612 --> 22:36.972
Thanks.

22:37.033 --> 22:37.433
I love that.

22:37.513 --> 22:38.434
I like that moment.

22:39.556 --> 22:42.019
Do you seek out these epiphanous moments?

22:42.980 --> 22:49.007
I don't seek them out, really, but I feel like I can't read the story until something evolves.

22:49.948 --> 22:52.051
And that's always been my own conflict.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.954
I've been half incredibly safe.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.677
I went to medical school.

22:56.697 --> 22:58.419
Go to medical school and you're sick.

22:59.520 --> 23:06.028
On the other hand, I wanted to be a writer, which is about as wild a leap.

23:06.903 --> 23:07.884
as you can take.

23:07.984 --> 23:09.085
180 degrees.

23:09.486 --> 23:09.786
Yeah.

23:10.287 --> 23:11.408
I mean, in terms of security.

23:11.548 --> 23:13.891
In terms of security, that's what I'm talking about.

23:13.911 --> 23:16.994
It's not coincidental that I'm always schlepping my column over.

23:17.014 --> 23:17.835
Right, right.

23:18.175 --> 23:19.297
Trying to make a week's pay.

23:19.417 --> 23:20.918
Right, exactly.

23:20.998 --> 23:22.840
To try and support the other things.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.083
Right, exactly.

23:25.103 --> 23:25.924
But it is interesting.

23:25.944 --> 23:27.505
You think there's a duality here?

23:27.666 --> 23:28.146
Oh, yeah.

23:28.386 --> 23:29.267
No question.

23:29.908 --> 23:30.789
No question about it.

23:31.370 --> 23:36.235
And I've always had this desire for uproar, and I've

23:37.160 --> 23:41.326
I'm always tempted to go out the back door and run.

23:42.187 --> 23:42.488
Really?

23:42.728 --> 23:43.029
Yeah.

23:43.950 --> 23:46.634
That can almost be the closing quote of the piece.

23:46.654 --> 23:48.857
I always look for the lead, and I always look for the way to end it.

23:49.338 --> 23:55.186
I never leave an interview until I definitely have the lead in my head.

23:55.206 --> 23:56.929
It's very nice to know how you're going to end it, too.

23:57.510 --> 24:03.959
That reminds me of when I was working on Newsweek for a while, and I was covering the New York Mets for a really short time.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.002
What was this?

24:06.978 --> 24:09.902
85, I think, or maybe 86, probably 85.

24:10.102 --> 24:11.243
You worked for Newsweek?

24:11.263 --> 24:18.172
I had a AAAS, which is American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellowship, to be a science reporter for Newsweek.

24:18.192 --> 24:18.372
Oh, nice.

24:19.734 --> 24:21.877
And they said, you know, go down and cover the mess.

24:21.957 --> 24:24.300
Dwight Gooden was having this great year, and I was trying to interview him.

24:24.340 --> 24:30.227
But sitting up in the press box with these guys who have gone to every single baseball game for the last 10 years, what a depressing thing.

24:30.247 --> 24:34.713
You're sitting there saying, you know, by inning number two, I've got my lead.

24:36.335 --> 24:36.495
LAUGHTER

24:39.125 --> 24:39.505
Yeah.

24:40.347 --> 24:42.229
You know, I've done 800 author interviews.

24:42.249 --> 24:42.509
Right.

24:42.810 --> 24:48.997
I mean, the trick is that you never want them to be the same, but for the same token, you're looking for it.

24:49.178 --> 24:49.398
Right.

24:49.498 --> 24:50.780
Lead and a kicker.

24:50.980 --> 24:55.406
I'd like, you know, I'd like to be a nice little circle here.

24:57.969 --> 24:59.931
What time is your next appointment, by the way?

25:00.172 --> 25:02.715
Oh, I have, what time is it?

25:02.735 --> 25:03.516
It's almost 10.30.

25:03.536 --> 25:06.540
I think I have 11 o'clock interviews.

25:06.560 --> 25:06.820
I don't know.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.448
Why don't you give me your address to send you clips, if you'd like?

25:15.149 --> 25:18.995
Yeah, it's 318... 318... 12th Avenue.

25:19.375 --> 25:23.281
And make sure you don't send it to 12th Street, because half my mail gets lost at 318 12th Street.

25:23.301 --> 25:23.902
12th Avenue?

25:23.922 --> 25:25.043
Yeah, 12th Avenue, right.

25:25.063 --> 25:25.884
And that's SF?

25:25.905 --> 25:26.545
San Francisco.

25:26.565 --> 25:27.667
94118.

25:27.687 --> 25:27.927
94118.

25:27.988 --> 25:28.548
Okay.

25:31.553 --> 25:38.002
And do you think you might need to call me to fill in anything?

25:38.483 --> 25:40.045
Are you going to be home with me again?

25:40.065 --> 25:41.447
No, I'll be here...

25:41.765 --> 25:43.607
I'm going to... I'll probably write this on Monday.

25:43.927 --> 25:45.389
I'll be in Miami on Monday.

25:46.950 --> 25:48.933
I'll give you my experience.

25:49.073 --> 25:51.095
You can always call Sally Hoffman, too.

25:51.675 --> 25:57.441
I'm staying at the Hotel Colonnade on Monday, March 7th, which is 305-441-2600.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.370
I don't foresee it to be truthful.

26:05.610 --> 26:08.653
Normally I do a little mixture.

26:08.873 --> 26:10.455
Right.

26:10.992 --> 26:13.554
You've done this 500 times, I'm sure you can.

26:13.594 --> 26:16.537
800 times.

26:17.358 --> 26:20.481
You know, it's an interesting little package.

26:21.642 --> 26:22.563
You're not supposed to do it.

26:22.603 --> 26:27.547
You're not supposed to mix little criticism, a little bit of criticism.

26:28.568 --> 26:32.692
It seems to be a saleable package, and that's what I like doing.

26:33.593 --> 26:39.919
Let me just think if there's anything... I know among writers, just going back to that duality,

26:40.169 --> 26:43.174
Among doctors, I'm considered pretty wild, I think.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.958
And among writers, I'm considered unbelievably conservative.

26:48.342 --> 26:51.687
What do the other doctors say to your physician?

26:51.707 --> 26:55.673
Well, they all say, do you mind reading a manuscript?

26:56.975 --> 26:57.896
You'd be amazed.

26:58.096 --> 27:08.893
You would be amazed at how many, not people my age, because they're still struggling, but doctors who, you know, what they call attending physicians,

27:09.295 --> 27:14.480
You know, guys in their 50s and 60s, they all want to write novels, and they have.

27:15.081 --> 27:17.103
All the Warriors want to be John Grisham.

27:17.123 --> 27:17.944
Right.

27:17.964 --> 27:19.465
I want to be John Grisham.

27:19.485 --> 27:21.507
Jesus Christ, fight a nickel for every book I've seen.

27:21.527 --> 27:23.950
Have you read any of his stuff?

27:23.970 --> 27:24.130
No.

27:25.251 --> 27:25.651
Is it not?

27:25.972 --> 27:27.033
Oh, it's certain.

27:28.474 --> 27:31.958
It's Scott Terrell, I think, that says the franchise of that, in a way.

27:32.078 --> 27:34.300
But I'm sure Grisham sells better than Terrell, yeah.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.282
He does, but his stories are not credible.

27:37.730 --> 27:41.774
This kid had been doing all this stuff, figuring out this last book.

27:41.794 --> 27:42.475
It's the only one I read.

27:42.796 --> 27:44.117
A Time to Kill, is that that one?

27:44.137 --> 27:44.778
Whatever it is.

27:44.798 --> 27:46.440
No, it's something else.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.362
The guy who witnesses, the kid who witnesses the murder?

27:48.382 --> 27:49.783
The witness, maybe, or something like that.

27:52.686 --> 27:53.107
I don't know.

27:53.447 --> 27:56.871
I remember I was sitting in a coffee shop, and this woman was reading one of the Gresham books.

27:56.891 --> 28:00.195
I remember looking over the shoulder and thinking, you know, what the hell?

28:00.235 --> 28:01.496
How did this guy capture the imagination?

28:01.516 --> 28:05.020
So I looked over her shoulder, and I read one sentence, and it was,

28:05.759 --> 28:09.204
As the intensity of the hurricane increased, so did the intensity of their sex.

28:09.645 --> 28:10.547
Something like that.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.810
I thought I did it.

28:12.870 --> 28:18.660
Why can't I say that?

28:18.680 --> 28:20.262
Would you do me the honor?

28:20.322 --> 28:20.843
Oh, of course.

28:21.103 --> 28:27.013
And David, use this pen, unless you have a better pen.

28:27.033 --> 28:29.577
I have a great collection of describe books for you.

28:29.597 --> 28:30.058
I'm sure.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.480
I work on a thriller.

28:31.780 --> 28:33.321
I think I might try to write that thriller.

28:33.341 --> 28:38.786
Plus, I might try to write more of these 60-page jobs, these kind of long stories, which I like.

28:38.986 --> 28:43.250
Are you pleased with the length of this collection, or do you think maybe you could have used one or two more stories?

28:43.290 --> 28:44.931
Well, I had another story that I didn't put in it.

28:46.973 --> 28:48.154
You know, I've written all my books.

28:48.174 --> 28:50.296
I've been on the short side.

28:50.716 --> 28:53.018
I had another story I didn't want to put in it because it was different.

28:53.038 --> 28:53.859
It was 20 pages.

28:53.879 --> 28:55.821
It was just a different kind of thing.

28:55.841 --> 28:56.742
It was just a short story.

28:56.922 --> 29:01.686
In your mind, is there a connecting theme for these stories?

29:04.231 --> 29:10.440
The only connecting theme... No, I don't think there is.

29:12.323 --> 29:13.565
There's a connecting emotion.

29:18.972 --> 29:27.325
Maybe contemplation of loss, or... Maybe there lies the end of accountant.

29:27.345 --> 29:28.907
That's a central thing for you, too.

29:28.927 --> 29:33.073
Yeah, I'm wondering why of all the lies that might have been mine, I've led the one I have described.

29:34.589 --> 29:36.271
How does it go again?

29:37.493 --> 29:44.061
He says, uh, I was seen as I sometimes end with sadness.

29:44.221 --> 29:49.768
I suppose I was wondering, although it is strange for me to admit it, why of all the lives it might have been mine, I have led the one I have just described.

29:58.278 --> 30:00.381
How long is the, uh, that you're an intern?

30:00.962 --> 30:02.183
Do you have a residency, Mary?

30:02.686 --> 30:04.828
Internship is the first year of a residency.

30:05.890 --> 30:11.256
And then I have two more years to finish a residency.

30:11.276 --> 30:14.319
But what I'm going to do next year, actually, is they allowed me to split it.

30:14.900 --> 30:22.829
So I'm going to work two months, take two months off, work two months, take two months off, and do my second year split over two years so I'll be able to write a novel next year.

30:22.849 --> 30:29.256
When we first met, we still had a year, I think, a year in medical school.

30:29.356 --> 30:29.656
Right.

30:29.676 --> 30:30.737
And you were taking it off.

30:30.998 --> 30:31.258
Yeah.

30:31.728 --> 30:35.652
And I said, I hope he finishes, but I... But you doubt it.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.734
I doubted it, too.

30:37.814 --> 30:39.536
Are you going to South America or something like that?

30:39.556 --> 30:40.537
Right, I went to South America.

30:40.557 --> 30:41.358
I went to Ecuador.

30:42.018 --> 30:43.079
I went to Quito, Ecuador.

30:43.119 --> 30:44.781
How much time did you take off?

30:44.801 --> 30:45.241
Five years.

30:46.403 --> 30:46.963
I finished it.

30:46.983 --> 30:47.143
Really?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.105
Were you tempted not to go back?

30:49.245 --> 30:49.866
Are you kidding?

30:49.946 --> 30:51.428
God, I was tempted not to go back.

30:52.088 --> 30:57.273
You know, I started my internship after being away from medicine for five years.

30:58.475 --> 31:00.857
And, boy, was that a trauma.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.818
I mean, it's a trauma when you start it normally.

31:02.858 --> 31:03.439
Yeah.

31:03.459 --> 31:05.381
Well, why five years?

31:05.461 --> 31:08.706
I mean, were you saying, I think maybe I will be there?

31:08.786 --> 31:09.467
Maybe I will.

31:09.547 --> 31:10.628
Yeah, maybe I'll just be right.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.510
Yeah, exactly.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.514
But then it wasn't the uncertainty that got me, actually, in the end.

31:15.614 --> 31:17.357
It was the loneliness.

31:17.377 --> 31:18.458
It was the lack of structure.

31:18.618 --> 31:21.021
I think people can't take freedom.

31:21.983 --> 31:22.864
A fiction writer's freedom.

31:22.884 --> 31:24.406
I mean, a journalist's freedom is different.

31:24.806 --> 31:25.647
Well, deadlines.

31:25.667 --> 31:26.929
Yeah, you've got deadlines.

31:28.090 --> 31:29.632
You have assignments.

31:29.652 --> 31:32.756
Look at the language that comes out of an assignment, a deadline.

31:33.737 --> 31:34.918
That's it right there.

31:35.058 --> 31:35.839
Right, exactly.

31:36.260 --> 31:42.828
And you're going out and you're doing things, and you've got to do research, and you've got things that kind of makes you keep up with things.

31:42.848 --> 31:46.912
But if you're just writing fiction, they send you some money, you've got a year to write it.

31:48.194 --> 31:52.299
It's no mistake that there were so many alcoholics who were novelists.

31:52.319 --> 31:52.519
Oh, yeah.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.360
Unbelievable.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.081
Yeah.

31:54.382 --> 31:58.829
I don't know if they then became novelists because they lost their jobs, or they were alcoholics, or it's hard for them.

31:58.849 --> 32:03.677
Well, I just think there's, you know, there have been studies for interesting books written on it.

32:03.697 --> 32:04.057
Haven't they?

32:04.178 --> 32:04.819
Oh, yes.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.945
The Thirsty Muse is the title of one.

32:08.965 --> 32:10.548
Really?

32:10.568 --> 32:12.591
That's a great title.

32:13.653 --> 32:15.335
That came out a couple of years ago.

32:15.816 --> 32:18.280
Look at them all!

32:18.597 --> 32:22.462
It would be easier to name those who were not.

32:23.003 --> 32:24.465
Steinbeck, look at the poets.

32:24.565 --> 32:27.208
I mean, even a couple of women, you know, important women.

32:28.270 --> 32:30.012
Edna St.

32:30.112 --> 32:32.115
Vincent Millay, I think.

32:33.096 --> 32:34.317
One after the other.

32:34.638 --> 32:38.983
Oh yeah, Cheever, Richard Yates, William Styron.

32:39.084 --> 32:39.544
I knew him.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.168
He was a wonderful guy.

32:42.568 --> 32:43.409
Could you keep up with him?

32:43.469 --> 32:46.393
He was a bad guy.

32:46.593 --> 32:50.810
I remember going to a reading once with him and Styron, in which neither of them showed up.
