00:02.157 --> 00:04.940
Okay, we're talking to Mr. Ole Cassini.

00:04.980 --> 00:06.682
You said that book had to be written, sir.

00:07.103 --> 00:14.031
Yes, because, first of all, the people have a very one-dimensional idea about Jackie.

00:15.953 --> 00:19.678
The book had to be written because it's part of history.

00:19.698 --> 00:22.621
This is a lady that single-handedly created Camelot.

00:23.683 --> 00:27.287
This is a lady that was inspired, being a Francophile,

00:27.740 --> 00:28.821
by Versailles.

00:29.622 --> 00:40.676
She thought she would create the ambiance, the beauty, the interesting people, all of which were part of the ancient French courts.

00:40.696 --> 00:47.504
And she was erudite, she was interested, and she was ambitious.

00:48.485 --> 00:57.156
So, step by step, surrounding herself with the people she considered the best qualified for the job,

00:57.912 --> 01:04.440
She began phase two of her life, because I see Jackie in four phases.

01:04.740 --> 01:05.060
Really?

01:06.122 --> 01:08.624
She was four ladies, not one.

01:08.965 --> 01:10.507
She was a complex personality.

01:11.328 --> 01:27.126
And where I thought that I had to do something is because I thought that unless a beautiful book was put together, that...

01:27.427 --> 01:34.055
wonderful achievement that she got in creating camera art would not be clearly understood.

01:34.075 --> 01:54.298
I think this graphically shows with the modest talent that I have as a writer, but having enough culture and interest, I thought that I would put a book together that would be a permanent part of America.

01:55.159 --> 01:56.961
It may seem ambitious,

01:57.278 --> 02:20.463
It may seem for me to be ambitious about this project, but I thought that if you could have a non-polemic book beautifully presented, step by step showing how she gained confidence in her job, how she became really the first lady of the land, and one of the most important characters in recent history.

02:20.984 --> 02:23.286
Did she know that you were working on this before she died?

02:23.306 --> 02:23.927
No.

02:24.532 --> 02:25.293
She did not know.

02:25.674 --> 02:27.196
I didn't know I was going to do it.

02:27.497 --> 02:31.382
You probably would not have done it, do you think, if she were still alive?

02:31.563 --> 02:35.749
I would have stopped because there were two things that were interesting in the book.

02:35.849 --> 02:47.908
First, I wanted to put to the best of my ability together this thousand days of magic that were magical for the nation, for the world, and for me.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.615
And then, secondly, I wanted to redress certain of the things

02:53.236 --> 03:02.091
that I went through 35 years, because if she'd been alive, she was always there to defend me.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.120
She was a very, very private person.

03:07.882 --> 03:09.464
She didn't want people to interfere.

03:09.504 --> 03:11.067
Very loyal, it sounds.

03:11.127 --> 03:12.490
But very, very loyal.

03:13.391 --> 03:16.797
So she...

03:17.215 --> 03:20.579
It was important for me to put the letters that she wrote me.

03:20.899 --> 03:27.146
Of course, the letters are letters that are interesting only because they refer to the work I was doing for her.

03:28.488 --> 03:38.820
But in the casting, at the beginning, a lot of people in the industry didn't want to acknowledge that I had the right to be considered.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.204
I just didn't fit.

03:42.224 --> 03:43.145
Why do you suppose that is?

03:43.585 --> 03:44.927
Well, I don't know.

03:45.397 --> 03:56.152
For the very reason that I fitted with them, somehow, for some of the cogniscenti of the 7th Avenue, they proposed other designers.

03:56.773 --> 03:58.135
It was a very plum job.

03:58.275 --> 04:01.880
It was an important thing for me, for any designer.

04:02.501 --> 04:07.388
And the traditional viewpoint in fashion was that you have to go to Paris first.

04:07.807 --> 04:16.759
and then pay homage there, and then come back, and then pretend that you're creative, when in effect, often, you just copy what they do.

04:16.939 --> 04:20.584
I think a point you make is that this was an American statement, too.

04:20.604 --> 04:20.844
Yes.

04:21.305 --> 04:23.167
And that's very important, isn't it?

04:23.187 --> 04:23.788
Yes.

04:23.808 --> 04:31.398
And it's a very good question, because the key was that I created a look for her.

04:32.359 --> 04:37.105
I didn't want to create dresses for the sake of creating dresses.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.099
I want to be logical.

04:39.499 --> 04:45.626
And that's why she selected me, because in Hollywood I had the opportunity to work with a script.

04:45.646 --> 04:48.509
In effect, I was given a script.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.091
That's wonderful.

04:50.111 --> 04:50.632
I love that whole concept.

04:50.652 --> 05:05.048
I was given a script, and it was easy for me, because I had worked in Italy, I had worked in France, I had worked in Hollywood, and on Seventh Avenue, so I had a pretty good record there.

05:05.629 --> 05:06.670
The question was,

05:07.223 --> 05:07.864
Why me?

05:09.866 --> 05:13.250
Why me is because I was more than a designer.

05:13.510 --> 05:20.639
I was a friend of the family, trusted, because above all, there was a question of trust.

05:20.659 --> 05:31.071
And, of course, because she thought that my international experience and my being an American and my military service... But also your royal...

05:32.114 --> 05:34.959
Blood must have been helpful too, I would think.

05:35.139 --> 05:44.694
Well, in her viewpoint, yes, because she thought that I would be able to interpret a look for her that was for her role.

05:45.475 --> 05:49.101
She always said to me, you dressed me for the role.

05:49.662 --> 05:50.283
She said that.

05:50.303 --> 05:50.564
Yes.

05:51.165 --> 05:52.847
She said that to me and to others.

05:52.907 --> 05:54.510
So you don't think it was ego then?

05:55.351 --> 06:04.063
No, I think that once she got some competence, because it was like a play in Broadway.

06:04.083 --> 06:04.924
And she was young, too.

06:04.944 --> 06:06.507
I think people forget how young she was.

06:06.567 --> 06:13.977
Very young, and suddenly thrust into a position of such power where every movement was analyzed.

06:15.980 --> 06:21.067
She became a number one ambassador in the world.

06:21.728 --> 06:24.852
But power is a strange...

06:25.152 --> 06:53.269
strange thing it affects people differently and as she grew in power she realized that she really had something that she could do a mission you you recount in the book how when you went to see her in the hospital and she said she immediately asked you if you'd work with work with her and you said only if I do it alone correct I thought that was a very gutsy thing for you to do it was gutsy it was I recognized this it was a

06:54.008 --> 06:58.054
Take your chance and say the thing you should say.

06:58.074 --> 07:11.051
Because I said to her, and I think you read it before, I said, look, if you have more than one person, you're going to have tremendous battles for recognition from all your designers.

07:12.053 --> 07:19.543
And discretion will not be a part of their everyday diet because they're going to fight for recognition.

07:19.996 --> 07:21.739
And you would spend a lot of time with them.

07:21.899 --> 07:26.385
You need somebody, and it doesn't have to be me, because I was a friend after all.

07:26.766 --> 07:34.477
She said, take someone that will see what they have to do, do it for you diligently, and then you'll be much more comfortable.

07:34.677 --> 07:38.463
And then at that time, she said, but you know, I already ordered a dress and bird clothes.

07:38.483 --> 07:39.184
I read that.

07:39.204 --> 07:39.945
It's wonderful.

07:40.313 --> 07:41.896
And I said, I understand that.

07:42.156 --> 07:47.324
So she called Bergdorf, and you read that, and she said, Cassini will do the designing.

07:47.344 --> 07:48.066
And you can make it.

07:48.166 --> 07:48.987
And you can make them.

07:49.007 --> 07:50.570
And they said, no, we have designers.

07:51.150 --> 07:53.695
So it didn't work out to a person.

07:53.715 --> 07:55.277
That wasn't too smart of them, was it?

07:55.598 --> 07:57.280
I think it was not smart at all.

07:57.320 --> 08:01.327
Because at least they would have gotten some recognition out of it.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.849
Continuous recognition.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.332
Yeah.

08:04.352 --> 08:06.355
So you made the...

08:07.128 --> 08:09.170
all of this material in your shop.

08:09.270 --> 08:15.095
Well, I was a very successful designer at the time, and I consider myself successful today.

08:15.555 --> 08:24.603
I was one of the best lines on 7th Avenue, and I created a separate entity to be able to service her.

08:26.985 --> 08:29.768
I was amazed that there were 300 outfits for 1,000 days.

08:29.808 --> 08:30.929
That's one every three days.

08:31.730 --> 08:35.633
Yes, but a lot of designs were not even photographed.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.957
I mean, that's a lot of work for you.

08:39.237 --> 08:39.758
Tremendous.

08:41.019 --> 08:41.639
Tremendous.

08:42.140 --> 08:46.604
When I look at that book, sometimes I take that book and I look at it.

08:47.284 --> 08:48.665
And I said, how could you do it?

08:49.766 --> 08:52.349
It was so, there were many risks.

08:52.409 --> 09:05.400
First of all, what really happened, it was very lucky for me, is that the first two or three outfits that appeared were saluted by everybody as being wonderful.

09:06.190 --> 09:09.695
And the most severe critics of fashion are the French.

09:10.456 --> 09:20.469
And they recognized that a new look had been born and that there was a tranquil, dignified look for a first lady.

09:20.989 --> 09:24.855
I wasn't trying to use her as a model for my collection and my ideas.

09:25.576 --> 09:27.718
I was just going with the scenario.

09:28.379 --> 09:30.642
Was there anything that you did for her that she didn't like?

09:31.924 --> 09:32.805
A couple of times.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.333
Did she ever send things back?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.896
She sent me a couple things back.

09:37.916 --> 09:39.558
Did you learn from these?

09:39.638 --> 09:46.627
I learned from them because I had an idea that because she was an equestrian and a very good one.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.870
And you were an instructor in the cavalry.

09:48.890 --> 09:54.237
Yeah, I was also doing the same things with horses and we had a horse dialogue going.

09:54.517 --> 09:57.942
And I sent her a quote that I recreated.

09:58.062 --> 10:01.727
It was kind of inspired by the hunt, the pink.

10:01.747 --> 10:01.847
Okay.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.235
And I thought that she would love it.

10:04.355 --> 10:15.429
Unfortunately, I picked the regular fabric that is used for such things and turned out to be so heavy that she couldn't wear it.

10:15.449 --> 10:22.257
So she sent it back and she said, very good idea, but it's too heavy.

10:22.778 --> 10:23.498
I can't wear it.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.844
What did she, what kind of input did she, did she give input?

10:28.084 --> 10:29.145
Did she help her?

10:29.245 --> 10:30.206
Only very general.

10:30.507 --> 10:30.687
Look,

10:32.320 --> 10:46.862
If you look at, when she hired the cook for the White House because she wanted French cuisine, she would say to the cook, prepare me a menu and do it.

10:47.763 --> 10:48.584
And the same with me.

10:49.285 --> 11:00.302
Once I presented the sketches and she liked them, and 99% of the time she liked them, she said, do it.

11:00.603 --> 11:01.744
Just do it.

11:02.385 --> 11:04.567
So you presented her with sketches first.

11:04.587 --> 11:04.807
Yes.

11:05.988 --> 11:20.081
But people had the idea, completely erroneous, that she arrived at the White House from phase one to phase two with a lot of clothes, wheat-torn luggage, having lived in luxury and all that.

11:20.962 --> 11:22.043
No, it was not.

11:22.263 --> 11:25.626
She was very parsimonious in the first phase.

11:25.666 --> 11:29.209
First she'd been a reporter and then married to a senator.

11:29.527 --> 11:31.810
Jack Kennedy didn't spend much on clothes.

11:32.030 --> 11:34.994
He was such a charismatic, elegant figure.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.416
He didn't need it.

11:37.658 --> 11:39.881
But she needed it.

11:40.381 --> 11:45.488
And she'd say, all right, I'm going to India.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.252
What do you think?

11:48.272 --> 11:52.758
So I had to think about the colors, the fabrics, because of the climate.

11:53.619 --> 11:55.922
So I had to put the thing in work.

11:57.134 --> 12:01.641
And in the letters you will see that she was very kind towards me.

12:01.701 --> 12:08.090
She constantly complimented me and kept my morale high.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.814
And I did my job.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.156
I kept doing my job.

12:12.617 --> 12:13.879
Canada is one thing.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.501
Climate is one thing.

12:16.383 --> 12:17.404
India is another thing.

12:17.885 --> 12:19.227
France is another thing.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.822
England is another thing.

12:21.043 --> 12:24.429
Not just these countries, but we're talking about the Pope and De Gaulle.

12:24.589 --> 12:25.851
Yes.

12:25.871 --> 12:33.265
They wanted to interview me about the dress she wore when she visited the Pope.

12:33.285 --> 12:42.902
But I could not do the interview because we had made a deal with CBS, with...

12:44.401 --> 12:51.087
Good Morning America, which was postponed because of O.J.

12:51.148 --> 12:51.568
Simpson.

12:52.088 --> 12:55.492
So I find myself squeezed in between O.J.

12:55.552 --> 12:56.453
Simpson and the Pope.

13:01.457 --> 13:02.739
Quite a country, isn't it?

13:02.759 --> 13:04.701
It is a country.

13:04.781 --> 13:05.061
It is.

13:05.842 --> 13:11.387
I love your observation that what you developed for her was a concept.

13:11.620 --> 13:25.714
I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about this conceptual... Well, first of all, I remember having real fear when suddenly she said, you're the one.

13:25.734 --> 13:27.796
I said, what do I do now?

13:28.477 --> 13:32.001
Because it was easy to talk, but to do it was another thing.

13:32.081 --> 13:35.004
And I said, go back to your background.

13:35.044 --> 13:38.808
See what you can learn from your background to do a good job here.

13:38.828 --> 13:41.070
And I felt suddenly...

13:41.523 --> 13:46.948
completely relaxed when I said, I'm going to do what I did in Hollywood.

13:48.029 --> 13:56.676
I'm going to think about her life, what she's going to have to do, I want to facilitate her life.

13:57.797 --> 14:01.381
Everything has to be perfect because she was such a perfectionist, believe me.

14:01.961 --> 14:06.945
Friends or no friends, if I had not done the job in the first two weeks, I was a goner.

14:07.726 --> 14:08.547
Oh, I'm sure of that.

14:08.707 --> 14:09.808
A goner.

14:10.008 --> 14:10.789
And I knew it.

14:11.090 --> 14:14.936
People at that level don't call high power.

14:14.956 --> 14:15.156
No.

14:15.176 --> 14:22.047
And the strange thing about power, because in my life I've been very lucky, I've been close to high power.

14:22.768 --> 14:24.070
And they change.

14:25.352 --> 14:26.073
They change.

14:26.434 --> 14:27.235
No matter.

14:27.255 --> 14:36.690
It's not pejoratively said, it's just that when you constantly, constantly, sycophantically change,

14:37.109 --> 14:42.415
treated during night and day, it is impossible in human nature not to take some of it.

14:42.795 --> 14:45.278
So she really was a taskmaster.

14:45.298 --> 14:49.662
She wanted the best, and she thought she got the best, and I thought she got the best.

14:49.682 --> 14:56.289
Let's say that she's the same person, with the same temperament, with the same aspirations, and that she looks a little different.

14:56.309 --> 15:04.658
I'm not saying that she's unattractive, but was it necessary for her to be the woman that she was physically for you to create?

15:05.439 --> 15:06.340
Yes, because

15:07.028 --> 15:10.973
Another very good question, because there are limitations.

15:11.234 --> 15:12.796
There were no limitations with her.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.618
She was a pretty woman.

15:15.419 --> 15:23.870
The question was to make her appear as pretty as possible, because every human body has some things that are better than other features, you know.

15:24.411 --> 15:29.998
And so I made a profound anatomical analysis of her.

15:30.018 --> 15:33.563
I also said to myself, where does the inspiration come?

15:33.643 --> 15:35.145
What is she to you?

15:35.851 --> 15:37.493
All right, she's the first lady now.

15:37.613 --> 15:39.656
You have to satisfy every whim.

15:39.676 --> 15:41.799
But who is she for you?

15:41.879 --> 15:45.804
To me, she was an ancient princess of Egypt.

15:47.226 --> 15:53.955
The wife of a pharaoh, maybe, because her lines were very geometric.

15:54.977 --> 15:56.719
You give her measurements in here, too.

15:56.739 --> 15:58.902
Yes, it's interesting.

16:01.205 --> 16:04.710
And so this inspiration...

16:05.416 --> 16:10.062
was logical because I knew that she would wear certain clothes extremely well.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.167
Other things would not be suited for her.

16:14.187 --> 16:23.499
If suddenly I decided to aggrandize my own name, to dress her in frilly things, no, there had to be a draconian departure.

16:23.919 --> 16:27.764
Eliminate everything and start from scratch for her.

16:28.525 --> 16:30.107
Don't have preconceived notions.

16:30.848 --> 16:35.153
Only do things that will make her appear at her best.

16:35.842 --> 16:54.544
First example, when I realized that she was going to be seen by the world during the swearing-in, it was a very cold day, I remember, in January, I believe, and I had been given the instruction that she needed something.

16:55.765 --> 16:59.750
At that point, she didn't even have the time to tell me what she would like, the color she would like.

17:00.131 --> 17:02.153
So I said to my, I looked,

17:02.504 --> 17:04.006
I tried to look at the scene.

17:04.066 --> 17:11.377
I said, well, all these ladies are going to wear fur coats.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.639
And they look like bears.

17:14.281 --> 17:19.089
Now I'm going to have her look like a young, beautiful, simple thing.

17:20.030 --> 17:28.883
And that little coat, base coat, with pillbox, by the way, that other people said they're designed, which is not true, uh...

17:30.128 --> 17:35.357
made her look so young, so fresh, so pretty, so unpretentious.

17:35.918 --> 17:51.524
Because one of the things that I think I was lucky to get into right away, that although she was regal in her periods, there was some quiet elegance, laissez faire, like if it was a natural thing.

17:51.705 --> 17:54.870
It was not some effort to create it.

17:55.137 --> 17:58.621
clothes that everybody would say, oh, how wonderful that dress.

17:59.022 --> 18:01.545
I want people to say how wonderful she looked.

18:01.985 --> 18:02.926
Focus on her beauty.

18:03.747 --> 18:05.249
How often did you have to go to Washington?

18:05.289 --> 18:07.332
Oh, all the time.

18:08.173 --> 18:08.713
All the time.

18:08.853 --> 18:14.861
And there, of course, I had the advantage of being invited to dinner, stayed there, come in any time.

18:15.341 --> 18:15.942
I mean, you know.

18:16.483 --> 18:16.903
Pretty nice.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.506
But I have to tell you a little thing that happened to me.

18:19.526 --> 18:24.452
The first group of dresses that after two weeks where she stayed in,

18:24.871 --> 18:32.238
and she had nothing to wear, truly nothing to wear, I told the secretary that I would arrive with some clothes.

18:33.059 --> 18:39.705
And I took the train, and I had about eight or nine boxes, big boxes like that.

18:40.165 --> 18:44.450
I couldn't find a porter, and I expected the White House to send somebody to help me.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.074
And I looked around, and it was snowing at Castle Road.

18:49.094 --> 18:54.439
Well, I want to tell you something, that there was a snafu, and nobody came to pick me up.

18:54.925 --> 19:02.537
So I had to be in line, pushing these boxes on my seat, while there were hundreds of people asking for a taxi.

19:03.038 --> 19:11.050
Finally, slipping a 20 to the guy, I got myself a place in a cab with five other people.

19:11.331 --> 19:11.511
Wow.

19:12.413 --> 19:14.236
And he said, where are we going?

19:14.256 --> 19:17.280
I said, the White House.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.804
So we go to the White House.

19:20.766 --> 19:22.789
They clear me, and they say, Cassini and his

19:23.005 --> 19:28.091
as people are coming in, and they thought the passengers were my people.

19:28.151 --> 19:29.652
I was alone.

19:30.073 --> 19:34.538
And these people were absolutely amazed.

19:34.558 --> 19:38.102
I'm sure they still talk about that to this very day.

19:38.122 --> 19:43.648
I guess, have we regressed since then?

19:43.748 --> 19:46.691
Because it was such a statement of fashion and how important things are.

19:46.711 --> 19:48.473
I'm just thinking in terms of

19:48.875 --> 19:51.798
How important was she as a leader, as a senator?

19:51.818 --> 20:00.385
Well, she was important then, but the more interesting thing, by coincidence, in history, every major designer is doing the Jackie Look now.

20:01.045 --> 20:01.346
Still?

20:01.986 --> 20:03.167
I still have a return to it.

20:03.187 --> 20:04.609
No, the return, why?

20:05.089 --> 20:05.649
Good question.

20:07.451 --> 20:08.952
I gave it a lot of thought, believe me.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.338
We are a country that is not at ease.

20:16.259 --> 20:17.920
We are very, very

20:18.507 --> 20:22.832
We're passing a strange period in our history, in the world, as a matter of fact.

20:23.813 --> 20:30.200
So the designers for years now have done clothes not for people but for the media.

20:31.522 --> 20:39.992
So they would pick a genetically perfect individual, put some crazy clothes on them, parade them, and these were wearable clothes.

20:41.093 --> 20:44.717
And suddenly, because they didn't sell in the stores and because

20:45.035 --> 20:49.299
There was a nostalgic desire to go to a quieter elegance.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.963
Who could, better than her, could give that example?

20:53.544 --> 21:02.293
So today, everybody, I reproduce the entire line that I did for her, and every store is buying it.

21:02.853 --> 21:06.417
I understand you're bringing out a line, is it this fall, the black tie line?

21:06.597 --> 21:10.882
Well, the black tie is done all along, but in the black tie, there is a group.

21:11.222 --> 21:12.984
I mean, there was some Jackie inspired.

21:13.044 --> 21:14.265
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

21:14.650 --> 21:15.511
And that's coming out?

21:16.151 --> 21:16.712
It's now.

21:16.852 --> 21:17.733
It's in the store.

21:17.973 --> 21:19.595
Because I read the presses of this flaw.

21:19.615 --> 21:20.956
I guess this is the flaw.

21:20.976 --> 21:22.497
Yeah.

21:22.517 --> 21:28.523
Tell me about some of these ingenious things, like the hat and the... Where did that come from?

21:28.543 --> 21:32.607
Well, that little pillbox.

21:32.627 --> 21:32.987
The pillbox.

21:33.027 --> 21:34.949
The pillbox was born this way.

21:36.170 --> 21:40.214
In my inspiration, I thought about Egypt.

21:40.234 --> 21:43.196
And if you really think of what... Nefertiti.

21:43.236 --> 21:43.797
Nefertiti.

21:44.350 --> 21:45.372
Exactly.

21:45.673 --> 21:46.955
Nefertiti, I said.

21:47.737 --> 21:52.967
Furthermore, she didn't particularly like hands.

21:53.548 --> 21:56.113
So I had to create non-hands.

21:57.475 --> 22:00.942
Something that would finish the whole look, but was not...

22:02.390 --> 22:04.293
Again focusing on the hat itself.

22:04.313 --> 22:05.735
Was the muff your idea too?

22:05.755 --> 22:07.137
The thing she put her hand in?

22:07.157 --> 22:07.698
Yes, yes.

22:07.979 --> 22:09.141
It was called a muff, I think.

22:09.161 --> 22:09.561
Yes.

22:09.782 --> 22:12.125
But she, I didn't do that for her.

22:12.285 --> 22:14.950
She had, she got it from one of her relatives.

22:15.791 --> 22:22.321
And because I'm a nun for designer, even the little mink that she put around her collar, that was hers.

22:23.022 --> 22:25.626
And it finished the outfit very nicely, but I mean it.

22:26.868 --> 22:30.574
Now I had a terrible experience when I recommended to her to

22:31.398 --> 22:36.284
wear a, because it was out of fashion at the time, a leopard coat.

22:36.304 --> 22:42.451
And I still feel the pain of having done that, because they almost killed all the leopards in the world.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.674
They became so fashionable.

22:45.715 --> 22:51.241
And that turned me away from all of that, and I am now regretted.

22:51.261 --> 22:54.545
It's one of the sins, involuntary sins, I committed.

22:55.146 --> 22:56.427
We weren't, don't we?

22:57.329 --> 22:57.529
No.

22:58.270 --> 22:58.570
You...

22:58.769 --> 23:01.613
Of course, now you've made clothes for Grace Kelly.

23:01.954 --> 23:07.341
What if Grace Kelly had been the first lady?

23:07.361 --> 23:07.922
Same thing.

23:09.004 --> 23:09.765
It would have been the same.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.227
She was almost the first lady.

23:11.327 --> 23:12.268
I understand.

23:12.789 --> 23:25.588
She is a... She would have played... She would have been dressed differently, but she would have been a very good first lady, Grace Kelly.

23:25.648 --> 23:27.190
I'm also talking about how would you...

23:27.490 --> 23:57.328
had the same assignment let's say to if Grace had been the first lady and you had had the same position with her that you had with Jackie do you think you would have done similar kinds of no because the bodies were different I would have done completely in fact I think I'm going to do a collection on Grace Kelly a completely different approach so obviously the

23:57.933 --> 24:00.636
physical, the body, as you say.

24:00.676 --> 24:01.117
The body.

24:01.497 --> 24:02.599
She had a long neck.

24:02.979 --> 24:05.202
She had a sphinx-like interesting face.

24:05.382 --> 24:06.824
An exquisite woman.

24:07.024 --> 24:07.725
Yes.

24:07.745 --> 24:12.391
And everything lended itself to the hieroglyphical kind of inspiration.

24:15.355 --> 24:16.676
No frills in all her clothes.

24:17.237 --> 24:18.399
Very great simplicity.

24:18.639 --> 24:19.940
We're talking about Kelly now, right?

24:19.981 --> 24:24.006
No, we're talking about... Grace would have been another thing.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.809
More diaphanous, more...

24:27.127 --> 24:30.892
Angelic, a different type.

24:30.912 --> 24:35.659
But you say in the book you imagined the use for the particular dress, the outfit.

24:36.220 --> 24:43.049
So let's say that you were imagining the same event, meeting with the Pope, meeting with de Gaulle.

24:43.349 --> 24:44.771
It would still have been different.

24:44.791 --> 24:46.614
It would have been different, yeah.

24:46.634 --> 24:47.335
Completely different.

24:47.876 --> 24:49.418
Interesting.

24:50.119 --> 24:52.081
Did you wear many of these things over again?

24:52.202 --> 24:53.303
Yes, many.

24:53.789 --> 24:58.074
I think our misconception is that she wore one of these dresses once.

24:58.094 --> 24:58.815
No, no, no.

24:58.875 --> 25:03.060
Some of the more recognizable dresses she wore two or three times.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.181
She liked them.

25:04.201 --> 25:04.722
Publicly?

25:05.102 --> 25:05.623
Publicly.

25:05.683 --> 25:08.106
And she had them made in different colors.

25:09.107 --> 25:09.868
She did, yes.

25:10.729 --> 25:13.993
I love the fact that she had said that you reproduced it in the book.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.858
Under no circumstances she absolutely has to have the first.

25:19.459 --> 25:19.719
Yes.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.621
Why was that so important?

25:21.722 --> 25:22.142
Well,

25:24.181 --> 25:25.883
It would have been commercial otherwise.

25:25.923 --> 25:31.931
It would have been seen that I was profiting from that to put in my collection.

25:31.971 --> 25:37.739
In fact, I never, never, never put any of the dresses that I did for her in my collection.

25:38.460 --> 25:38.740
Really?

25:39.080 --> 25:39.361
Never.

25:39.421 --> 25:39.661
Never?

25:40.042 --> 25:40.342
Never.

25:41.023 --> 25:49.133
Because the American woman I was thinking about for my collection was not the first lady of the land.

25:49.995 --> 25:52.618
It was a completely different thing and the people don't understand

25:52.953 --> 25:57.440
A painter like Picasso had periods in his life.

25:57.460 --> 26:04.010
He had the blue period and all kinds of different moments in the evolution of a talent.

26:04.030 --> 26:13.605
And without comparing myself to a great master like Picasso, I think I am, in a commercial art like fashion, I am one of the best.

26:14.186 --> 26:19.855
And I can imagine certain things because a good designer has to have a sense of history,

26:20.122 --> 26:29.615
has to have a political sense, has to have what the consumer is concerned about, what it needs.

26:30.336 --> 26:49.302
So you have to be... Would you say that your experience with her, I mean, very successful, noted, famous...

26:49.585 --> 26:52.349
designer before your collaboration with her.

26:52.369 --> 26:54.152
I don't even know if you consider it a collaboration.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.013
You did work for her.

26:56.175 --> 26:59.139
Of course, you've done remarkable things since.

26:59.159 --> 27:03.446
But would you say, nevertheless, that that was more or less the defining event?

27:03.466 --> 27:10.997
Yes, because here I was dealing with a lady that was admired worldwide.

27:12.780 --> 27:17.567
Every work, every dress that I would do, coat or suit, whatever,

27:18.155 --> 27:21.058
were scrutinized by the world.

27:22.619 --> 27:26.743
Thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of women imitated her.

27:28.544 --> 27:34.550
So I think one thing we never address, or that I've not heard addressed, is this is risky.

27:34.690 --> 27:40.175
It's an opportunity of a lifetime, but it was fraught with some risks for you, I would think.

27:40.736 --> 27:41.716
A Broadway play.

27:42.838 --> 27:45.580
You don't know how it's going to go, first night.

27:46.758 --> 27:53.066
You're putting a lot of money behind it, lots of hopes, and suddenly, showtime.

27:56.471 --> 28:06.984
So, I mean, this could have, it did wonderful things for your reputation, it certainly only enhanced it, but worst case scenario is... Worst case scenario, I would have been obliterated.

28:07.325 --> 28:07.605
Really?

28:07.825 --> 28:10.249
Were you alert to that possibility?

28:10.269 --> 28:15.195
Well, fortuna, you were audacious.

28:16.407 --> 28:21.693
Good luck follows the audacious.

28:21.713 --> 28:33.145
I mean, you know, in life you have moments where enough, you have the vision of what could happen, good and bad, and you have to take a chance if you want to go forward.

28:34.446 --> 28:38.050
If you want to be safe, that's not the game you want to play.

28:39.512 --> 28:40.693
That's not a safe game.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.284
She certainly is unique to our lifetimes, isn't she?

28:44.304 --> 28:44.764
Yes.

28:44.784 --> 28:51.233
I don't know how many First Ladies there have been since then, and I certainly, even outside of the White House, I can't think of another woman.

28:51.253 --> 28:52.795
Well, you won't have anything.

28:52.976 --> 28:55.079
The combination of certain factors.

28:57.282 --> 29:06.274
A handsome president, rich, photogenic and charismatic, a First Lady of great beauty, dignity, and good taste.

29:06.694 --> 29:07.656
Intelligence.

29:07.676 --> 29:10.039
Intelligence and education.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.882
Let's not forget the education.

29:14.764 --> 29:17.988
Your brother called her, named her debutante of the year.

29:20.131 --> 29:22.834
The year.

29:22.854 --> 29:23.214
How?

29:25.196 --> 29:28.901
How could those many factors converge again?

29:28.961 --> 29:30.022
Never.

29:30.743 --> 29:31.884
It will never be again.

29:31.944 --> 29:32.345
Really?

29:32.725 --> 29:32.986
Never.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.127
It cannot.

29:35.008 --> 29:39.233
There is a, you know, you had some...

29:39.736 --> 29:41.479
They were young, good-looking, rich.

29:41.539 --> 29:43.922
They had everything.

29:43.942 --> 29:45.604
They were the dream of everybody.

29:46.446 --> 29:47.247
Amazing, isn't it?

29:47.267 --> 29:47.968
Amazing.

29:48.048 --> 29:48.709
To have lived through that.

29:48.809 --> 29:49.130
Yes.

29:50.211 --> 29:51.733
Was Camelot her conception?

29:51.914 --> 29:52.174
Yes.

29:53.816 --> 30:08.157
It came after a trip to Canada because the defining moment was after the enormous success she had when she visited Canada, the president looked at her differently.

30:09.098 --> 30:18.507
There was not only the wife he loved, but a tremendous political attu, Trump card, I mean.

30:19.308 --> 30:27.035
He suddenly realized, and he said it later when he was in France, I'm the guy that came, I'm paraphrasing, with Jackie Kennedy.

30:27.996 --> 30:32.680
But suddenly she became a political tool of the first order.

30:33.081 --> 30:33.781
Asset.

30:34.001 --> 30:34.582
Asset.

30:34.602 --> 30:37.685
I guess is the word, the operative word they used.

30:37.705 --> 30:37.885
Asset.

30:37.905 --> 30:38.886
Big asset.

30:39.355 --> 30:45.821
And he recognized it when he went to France and he said to himself, he said, I'm the man who's with Mrs. Kennedy.

30:46.001 --> 30:50.405
And the French were bananas over there, didn't they?

30:50.625 --> 30:54.128
It was quite an experience for you, I guess.

30:54.849 --> 30:55.630
Fantastic.

30:56.430 --> 31:01.034
And there could have been the case, because the French was silly and their criticism.

31:01.535 --> 31:07.320
There was nothing but only compliments from the French press and from the people at large.

31:08.009 --> 31:09.391
They liked the way she looked.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.256
She looked like the first lady.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.063
I'm just looking at my notes here if there's anything up.

31:17.504 --> 31:18.745
Pardon me for jumping around.

31:18.826 --> 31:20.328
No, no, go ahead.

31:20.348 --> 31:21.450
Do you want something to drink?

31:21.650 --> 31:22.351
No, I'm fine.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.593
Thank you, sir.

31:23.973 --> 31:27.719
I've been invited to your reception tonight, but I think I'm going to take a train back.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.322
I came down from Massachusetts.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.285
You're welcome, but whatever.

31:31.325 --> 31:36.733
I'd love to, at some point, I've recently written a book of my own, which is doing pretty well.

31:37.355 --> 31:38.757
In fact, Rizzoli has it.

31:38.777 --> 31:43.966
It's on collecting, on bibliomania, and I understand that you're quite a collector of things.

31:44.347 --> 31:45.850
I am collecting certain things.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.134
And armor, and I noticed this.

31:48.154 --> 31:49.055
Look at this paneling.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.600
I'll bet you this is something.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.481
How old is this?

31:52.501 --> 31:57.530
This house was brought in by the Wells Fargo family.

31:57.550 --> 31:58.051
Oh, really?

31:59.253 --> 32:02.198
It's a 17th century Dutch house on the exterior.

32:02.262 --> 32:07.768
And the paneling is Italian and English, 15th, 16th century.

32:08.129 --> 32:30.514
And the armor that I have downstairs, afterwards you might want to give a look through it, is all things I collected from the various... Eva Kasten in England, Lord Astor, I bought an armor from... Here and there, I collect something like that, and I think this goes well...

32:30.950 --> 32:37.896
With my upbringing, after all, I was brought up in Florence, a medieval city, small medieval city.

32:38.437 --> 32:42.661
And when I'm in this house, I feel at home.

32:43.682 --> 32:46.064
I had to recreate the ambiance.

32:46.564 --> 32:47.265
Why armor?

32:47.786 --> 32:51.589
I understand that you actually have said that armor made a fashion statement in its own way.

32:51.609 --> 32:52.890
Absolutely, in its own way.

32:53.231 --> 33:00.197
But armor because in my own, had the world not changed when I was a kid,

33:00.548 --> 33:01.169
A child.

33:02.531 --> 33:08.039
Had we not lost everything, chances are there never would be a designer.

33:08.099 --> 33:10.423
That would never be my first choice.

33:10.443 --> 33:16.853
I thought the army, to be part of the guards, and that was a cavalry officer.

33:17.153 --> 33:18.896
That was my thing.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.318
And today I'm still that way.

33:20.338 --> 33:21.680
I'm a professional driver.

33:22.181 --> 33:24.104
I race with my own horses.

33:24.565 --> 33:28.851
I do the things that, in my heart of hearts,

33:29.185 --> 33:30.647
would have been my first selection.

33:30.667 --> 33:35.434
Armour too, that comes to the... I mean, it's atavistic almost.

33:36.435 --> 33:38.098
You look wonderful, by the way.

33:38.118 --> 33:40.161
Do you exercise?

33:40.181 --> 33:41.643
You must exercise all the time.

33:41.703 --> 33:51.617
Yeah, I've been in violent sports, and I'm 82 years old, but my doctor tells me, keep doing what you're doing because you're out of the ordinary.

33:51.677 --> 33:53.139
You're really in marvelous shape.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.644
I believe...

33:57.147 --> 34:04.574
if it interests you at all, I mean that we don't use our imagination and our minds sufficiently.

34:05.135 --> 34:07.177
I think you can slow down disease.

34:07.197 --> 34:10.640
I think you can increase your life span.

34:11.101 --> 34:17.767
I think you can almost fit to your desire your body.

34:18.148 --> 34:23.593
I mean, I'm vain because it's been good for me to be vain.

34:23.894 --> 34:28.500
I look at myself and say, come on, you're getting a little fat here.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.064
I have a special pair of jeans that I put on.

34:31.084 --> 34:43.661
If I see that I'm gaining a little weight, I just sacrifice and I eliminate certain things because I feel that I have to have the physical part of the role.

34:43.741 --> 34:47.206
I mean, I am a creator, and I have to look like a creator.

34:47.727 --> 34:50.931
Can you, just to jump around a little bit, can you compare the...

34:51.232 --> 34:59.999
The White House, you said the four phases, and you do have them in the book too, but I guess you kind of lost touch with Jackie after the assassination.

35:00.320 --> 35:09.928
Well, first thing, first of all, I gave a party in this very house for her in Onassis when they got married.

35:11.249 --> 35:16.193
And I knew Onassis a long time before she ever knew him.

35:16.213 --> 35:21.137
And it was, as a matter of fact, one of the few defenders of her marriage at that time

35:21.505 --> 35:24.308
They were really furious at Jackie.

35:25.950 --> 35:32.878
They wanted her to be a vestal virgin and remain up there somewhere, untouchable.

35:33.359 --> 35:42.890
She went to Europe, but when you have your husband killed, when you have his brother killed, when this happens, you're suddenly worried about the future.

35:43.791 --> 35:46.374
It's very understandable that she left.

35:46.975 --> 35:47.456
She left.

35:47.796 --> 35:48.677
It was too much.

35:49.028 --> 35:54.815
She held on with great dignity to the tragic moment.

35:54.835 --> 36:00.122
But after that, she wanted peace and quiet and money and yachts.

36:00.142 --> 36:00.582
Security.

36:00.642 --> 36:02.505
Security for the children, too.

36:03.606 --> 36:07.491
I wrote a little blurb about her in my book because my book is about the passion for books.

36:07.951 --> 36:09.894
It's over 25 centuries.

36:09.914 --> 36:14.900
And when she died, her son came out and said she was with her friends, her family.

36:15.100 --> 36:18.124
She was surrounded by her friends, her family, and her book.

36:18.458 --> 36:19.359
Remember that quotation?

36:19.379 --> 36:20.000
Yes, yes.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.104
She went home to be with her books, her family, and her friends.

36:23.484 --> 36:26.247
I thought that was quite a very poignant statement.

36:26.427 --> 36:28.310
I agree with you.

36:28.350 --> 36:35.318
I think she accelerated her own demise because she didn't want to look the way she looked.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.502
Perfectionist to the end.

36:39.223 --> 36:40.024
She wanted to go.

36:40.304 --> 36:41.225
It was time to go.

36:41.245 --> 36:42.787
You believe this in your heart?

36:42.807 --> 36:43.808
I believe in my heart.

36:44.935 --> 36:45.355
Because?

36:45.536 --> 36:46.617
Would you just say that again?

36:47.278 --> 36:49.701
Do you think because she wasn't exactly the way?

36:50.141 --> 36:55.267
She didn't want to deal with the deterioration of the body.

36:56.008 --> 37:01.615
And I know a doctor that told me because she was taking care of it.

37:02.115 --> 37:05.159
She said, all right, I'm going home.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.565
And she ended it up because I believe that the mind can do it.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.748
I think you can absolutely...

37:12.830 --> 37:13.871
desire to die.

37:13.891 --> 37:14.933
I believe that.

37:15.514 --> 37:16.395
And she did it.

37:16.936 --> 37:20.541
Why is it so often you see a husband dies and the wife dies?

37:20.681 --> 37:21.462
Right away after.

37:21.502 --> 37:22.644
Or vice versa.

37:22.664 --> 37:23.785
It happens so often.

37:23.905 --> 37:24.526
So often.

37:24.626 --> 37:25.227
So often.

37:25.447 --> 37:27.090
We can kill ourselves easily.

37:27.490 --> 37:33.018
Or my father, who's 84, you know, he works, he has his own little business, and he goes in every day.

37:33.078 --> 37:34.580
And we say, why?

37:34.620 --> 37:35.641
It's not making any money.

37:35.802 --> 37:36.803
It doesn't matter.

37:37.123 --> 37:37.224
No.

37:37.244 --> 37:39.006
He goes in, and he's

37:39.475 --> 37:43.201
This is his little empire, you know, and it keeps him alive.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.445
If we close that thing, he dies.

37:47.127 --> 37:49.690
And I think that's exactly what you're saying.

37:49.710 --> 38:08.098
Well, in my case, I hope I have enough resiliency intellectually to, if I lost my business, etc., I would still want to die because it's a short experience anyway, life, and you want to go through it in as elegant a way as you can.

38:09.108 --> 38:15.962
What was the ultimate satisfaction for you, knowing that you had participated, would you consider this an historic event?

38:15.982 --> 38:16.624
Absolutely.

38:16.644 --> 38:20.392
Certainly in the history of fashion, and you might even just talk generally about fashion.

38:21.153 --> 38:23.358
Yes, I mean, it was a great accomplishment.

38:24.540 --> 38:29.631
It is proven to be one, because 35 years later, it's just the same interest.

38:30.151 --> 38:32.655
Among people who weren't even alive then.

38:32.795 --> 38:33.256
That's right.

38:33.416 --> 38:36.482
Young women, 35, 25, were wearing these clothes.

38:36.542 --> 38:38.124
Absolutely.

38:38.886 --> 38:41.270
I went to the Nixon Library the other day.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.073
I just came back from California.

38:43.894 --> 38:47.801
And I signed for 850 books there.

38:47.821 --> 38:49.684
850.

38:50.225 --> 38:50.966
Really?

38:51.307 --> 38:53.931
And I had to go there.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.444
There were maybe a hundred more people there that I could have signed books for.

38:57.864 --> 39:03.492
So I mean, that she is a goddess in the minds of people, no doubt.

39:03.512 --> 39:06.096
Larger than life, to use the cliche.

39:06.116 --> 39:07.438
Yes, larger than life.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.361
And you clothed her?

39:10.823 --> 39:16.852
Yeah, but you know, it was more than clothing, because look, when she wanted to give parties... You're giving me the quote I wanted.

39:16.872 --> 39:23.682
When she wanted to give parties, I knew all the people in Europe that she was interested in, or many of them,

39:24.117 --> 39:27.561
And she would ask me, who do you think we should have at this party?

39:28.442 --> 39:28.902
She asked you.

39:28.922 --> 39:29.182
Yes.

39:30.864 --> 39:32.205
She was making statements then.

39:33.066 --> 39:33.307
Right.

39:34.228 --> 39:39.373
It was a continuous effort to perfection.

39:40.054 --> 39:43.597
And so there I played a role.

39:44.779 --> 39:51.285
And then in the intimacy of that, on the weekends I spent with them, I mean, you know, we're not discussing clothes.

39:51.906 --> 39:53.888
We're discussing the plight of the Indians.

39:54.222 --> 40:01.649
I had certain things that I was trying to sneak through because I had a tiny bit of influence.

40:01.749 --> 40:04.873
And there were many, many things.

40:05.353 --> 40:11.639
And the president and I had one great love in common, cigars.

40:13.161 --> 40:13.701
You want one?

40:13.721 --> 40:14.782
I have some good ones.

40:15.103 --> 40:16.204
Would you smoke one with me?

40:16.304 --> 40:16.944
I would love one.

40:17.325 --> 40:17.605
May I?

40:17.625 --> 40:18.746
I'll get you one.

40:20.408 --> 40:22.330
I just want to check my tape while you do that.

40:22.730 --> 40:23.571
I'll get you a...

40:24.023 --> 40:45.727
I can't imagine anything better than this, though.

40:46.127 --> 40:47.048
This is quite wonderful.

40:47.569 --> 40:49.211
I hope you like it.

40:49.231 --> 40:53.035
If you don't mind, I'll get in my story that we enjoyed a cigar together.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.848
I would like you to do that.

40:56.428 --> 41:07.400
You see in the book there is a picture where the president is smoking his cigar while I imitate an Indian.

41:07.740 --> 41:11.865
He didn't like Nehru at all, so I made fun of that.

41:12.325 --> 41:18.452
What I consider myself to be was a samurai.

41:20.494 --> 41:23.157
I was a samurai.

41:23.558 --> 41:32.407
I was a Kennedy man, I was a samurai, and it transcended, believe me, all this transcended the designing.

41:33.528 --> 41:36.131
Because he offered me an opportunity to do something else.

41:36.191 --> 41:41.256
He said, do you want to design for Jackie, or do you want to be Commissioner of Indian Affairs?

41:41.916 --> 41:42.597
Was he serious?

41:42.777 --> 41:43.918
Serious, serious.

41:43.938 --> 41:48.503
Because I had a lifelong involvement with the Indians.

41:48.989 --> 41:50.531
I directed many.

41:51.072 --> 41:53.455
They knew nothing, the Kennedys, about the Indians.

41:55.157 --> 41:56.820
How did you learn so much?

41:58.322 --> 42:12.300
Because when I was a child, somehow the first books that I read were about Indians, and then later on I became involved with some tribes.

42:12.541 --> 42:14.483
I was an honorary chief in many tribes.

42:14.503 --> 42:16.065
I went to visit many.

42:16.286 --> 42:18.709
I stayed, and I lived in Ahogan,

42:19.229 --> 42:30.281
in Arizona with a Navajos, with a beautiful Indian girl that had graduated from the University of Arizona, because one day she dared me.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.983
She said, you're talking about Indian and all that.

42:32.003 --> 42:33.144
You couldn't live like an Indian.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.107
I said, yes, I could live like an Indian.

42:36.668 --> 42:38.470
So I lived like an Indian.

42:39.651 --> 42:43.515
And I was very, and still I am.

42:43.900 --> 42:48.104
I mean, I know that this fast is going on with these casinos where the Indians were.

42:48.124 --> 42:49.045
You just anticipated my question.

42:49.065 --> 42:50.867
Indian tribes that are not Indian tribes.

42:51.047 --> 42:52.068
Up in Connecticut.

42:52.088 --> 42:57.433
Yeah, but I mean, if you look at the types, the somatic characteristic of the Indians are not there.

42:57.754 --> 43:02.418
They're mostly Dutch mixed with some blacks and maybe here and there a little Indian.

43:03.279 --> 43:08.364
The Indians, you've got to find them with the Navajos.

43:08.684 --> 43:12.388
There are about 250,000 Navajos that are still Indians.

43:14.663 --> 43:28.861
Um, I guess I did ask, no, maybe I didn't ask you to contrast the White House Jackie with the, with the phase three Jackie, I guess, was the phase, the phase two was, was the first lady Jackie, right?

43:28.921 --> 43:44.101
The first phase, as I see it, prior to the White House, then the White House, then the Onassis period, and then the return to Fifth Avenue, her career, and, in the end.

43:44.121 --> 43:44.181
Um,

43:45.055 --> 43:51.542
How do you judge her sense of fashion after the White House?

43:51.562 --> 43:59.871
Well, she had lost a look.

43:59.891 --> 44:09.541
She had, on some dresses I thought she looked great, others I didn't like at all, but she did not have the look anymore because she was going to different people.

44:10.562 --> 44:12.784
The very thing I had prophesied early on

44:13.068 --> 44:16.093
Happened in phase two, in my opinion.

44:16.594 --> 44:23.986
Had she gone, let's say, to Valentino only, well, then she would have looked like Valentino.

44:24.407 --> 44:28.874
But she went here and there, and sometimes I didn't think the choices were good.

44:29.796 --> 44:32.721
Could you have sustained the look for eight years?

44:33.081 --> 44:33.843
Easy.

44:34.965 --> 44:35.245
Easy.

44:37.030 --> 44:40.074
I mean, this isn't one of these little ephemeral things.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.175
No, no, no.

44:41.215 --> 44:57.996
First of all, it was based on, first of all, having created that look, I could amplify around it, and I could experiment with other things, but basically the look was there, and it was wearability, simple, almost monocle elegance.

44:58.476 --> 45:01.180
So she would have stayed with her role.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.122
At one point she said to me,

45:03.457 --> 45:08.902
I would like something like, look like Princess Doretti, but younger.

45:09.662 --> 45:12.925
So what she was concerned is looking like a queen.

45:14.166 --> 45:15.127
And she looks like a queen.

45:16.008 --> 45:16.849
She was a queen.

45:17.149 --> 45:27.438
Can you think of any other women now, or subsequent to her, and not necessarily first ladies, but with whom you could have done something comparable?

45:27.979 --> 45:31.742
Yes, but I would never, well, yes, in a major motion picture star,

45:31.975 --> 45:34.237
I could have gotten, reached a lot of people.

45:34.998 --> 45:36.580
I think of anybody in particular.

45:36.880 --> 45:41.986
Well, I mean, I could have done it with Marilyn Monroe, although I designed only a few things for her.

45:42.446 --> 45:44.929
I could certainly have done it with Grace Kelly.

45:45.289 --> 45:48.052
I did it with Jean Tierney, which was my wife.

45:48.072 --> 45:51.135
So I think there were opportunities.

45:51.175 --> 45:52.176
There were all different types.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.440
I could have done different looks.

45:58.503 --> 45:59.944
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

45:59.964 --> 46:00.565
No, no, you take...

46:00.899 --> 46:02.261
all the time you need.

46:02.421 --> 46:05.324
At some point, will you mind if I take a few color photographs?

46:05.404 --> 46:06.045
Absolutely not.

46:06.065 --> 46:10.550
Because a lot of my newspapers do want color, and they're really going to do something nice with this.

46:11.011 --> 46:11.231
Good.

46:11.672 --> 46:14.915
And I've got some very good newspapers that take me.

46:14.935 --> 46:16.137
I'm in capital cities.

46:16.197 --> 46:21.563
I'm like in Austin, Texas, and Columbus, and I'm in Salt Lake City, and I'm in Toledo.

46:22.244 --> 46:25.428
I've got about 25 papers that I've lined up.

46:25.448 --> 46:26.369
You must be very happy.

46:27.650 --> 46:28.451
I work hard.

46:29.332 --> 46:29.893
Well,

46:30.582 --> 46:31.203
I am too.

46:31.783 --> 46:33.125
Well, I can see it.

46:33.145 --> 46:34.206
I'm very tired.

46:35.647 --> 46:37.609
I work hard, I guess.

46:37.649 --> 46:39.271
Believe me.

46:40.092 --> 46:41.253
You're not having your cigar.

46:41.353 --> 46:42.054
No, no.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.336
Don't do it just by my account.

46:44.376 --> 46:45.978
I hope you didn't just give me a cigar.

46:46.218 --> 46:46.638
No, no.

46:46.658 --> 46:49.141
I gave you a cigar because you're a cigar lover.

46:49.261 --> 46:50.402
That's why I gave you a cigar.

46:50.422 --> 46:52.905
That's wonderful.

46:53.706 --> 46:54.446
Look at that.

46:54.506 --> 46:57.429
Now, you must get these in from Havana, I would say.

46:57.750 --> 46:59.391
No, I get them from England.

46:59.932 --> 47:00.032
Ah.

47:03.961 --> 47:33.613
I have a girl that works in England that works for me in England and when she comes here she brings me but don't put it in the paper they will confiscate it I won't I could never do that and then just briefly do you have a comment on the state of taste today well I think that we're going through a great crisis in this country

47:33.965 --> 47:37.971
And fashion is only a reflection of the mood of the people.

47:38.792 --> 47:44.280
There is no, for instance, the people are not showing off as they used to be.

47:44.320 --> 47:48.386
Status, for the pure sake of status, is not in.

47:49.468 --> 48:02.807
A rich man in Hollywood will wear bat-fitting jeans and wear tennis shoes and a cap in the back and drive with one of those...

48:03.125 --> 48:29.875
jeeps or something like that whereas it used to be Rolls Royce's tailoring I mean to the immaculate tailoring in England that's out people are because I think one thing has happened finally happened to this great country we have lost something that was so charming optimism

48:30.833 --> 48:36.639
The optimism is gone, and it's reflected in the way people look, don't care.

48:36.739 --> 48:42.245
It's almost a revolt against the system, against the tax system, against many things.

48:47.491 --> 48:48.492
I thought you were continuing.

48:48.552 --> 48:48.913
Okay.

48:49.273 --> 48:54.619
But in terms of fashion, do you think that it's, has it regressed from where?

48:54.739 --> 48:54.799
No.

48:55.066 --> 48:58.149
It's a changing direction.

48:58.469 --> 49:02.433
They want a quieter, more elegant face.

49:02.874 --> 49:14.625
They want less frills, less crazy things, less show business, more real, good, tailoring, good value.

49:15.966 --> 49:18.268
And it behooves you to be alert to these changes.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.250
You've got to be ahead of it.

49:20.931 --> 49:22.052
Otherwise you're caught...

49:22.522 --> 49:23.864
And you're finished.

49:24.064 --> 49:28.892
I must please you, though, to see what you did 35 years ago.

49:30.033 --> 49:30.975
Enormously.

49:31.075 --> 49:36.122
I never thought that this would happen when I started this book.

49:36.884 --> 49:38.186
It's just a coincidence.

49:38.386 --> 49:46.598
Almost if destiny wanted to reward me and to get a recognition that I feel was not really always there.

49:47.179 --> 49:51.786
I feel that a lot of people try to obfuscate the fact

49:52.205 --> 49:57.532
They wanted to think that Jackie arrived in the White House and she designed all her clothes.

49:57.612 --> 49:59.915
And the designer didn't exist.

50:00.416 --> 50:04.662
And she probably cooked all the meals and painted all the rooms.

50:07.205 --> 50:08.968
Well, did you feel slighted?

50:09.288 --> 50:10.390
Yes, many times.

50:10.950 --> 50:12.933
Because she asked me not to defend myself.

50:13.614 --> 50:14.355
So you couldn't?

50:14.375 --> 50:14.756
I couldn't.

50:14.976 --> 50:16.778
And you really have kept your counsel?

50:17.319 --> 50:17.720
I have.

50:17.960 --> 50:18.961
For 35 years?

50:19.081 --> 50:19.342
Yes.

50:19.482 --> 50:19.562
Yes.

50:20.065 --> 50:27.875
So, I mean, you were one of these guys that, like the maid, you know, they leave and two months later there's a book out.

50:28.115 --> 50:29.877
Everybody wrote books about them.

50:30.258 --> 50:31.099
Their own people.

50:31.439 --> 50:32.521
Their own secretaries.

50:33.222 --> 50:33.782
I did not.

50:34.483 --> 50:37.587
But this time, this book had to be written.

50:38.208 --> 50:39.510
No one else could write it.

50:40.471 --> 50:41.312
You're aware of that.

50:42.774 --> 50:47.760
Because these books that are fashioned today are fashioned...

50:47.943 --> 51:05.084
for the purpose of making money, being grotesque and horrendous books about Grace Kelly, horrendous books about Jackie, Baba Jack, and this, I thought, would be, without being polemic, using only her words, the statement.

51:05.224 --> 51:05.664
That's it.

51:05.825 --> 51:06.806
That's the way it was.

51:06.826 --> 51:14.355
Well, I think it's a very elegant book, and you'll notice that I haven't asked you any of the salacious questions about Jack's womanizing and that.

51:14.656 --> 51:17.200
You know, that's ridiculous, isn't it?

51:17.421 --> 51:19.444
I had lunch Monday with Ben Bradley.

51:19.724 --> 51:20.846
In fact, this is very interesting.

51:20.866 --> 51:26.295
You have the third interview I've had this week with people who knew Kennedy very well.

51:27.057 --> 51:28.539
Ben Bradley, it just occurs to me.

51:28.559 --> 51:30.542
David Herbert Donald, the historian.

51:30.943 --> 51:31.764
Yes.

51:31.865 --> 51:35.871
He went to his house in Lincoln, Mass the day before yesterday.

51:35.931 --> 51:36.773
Here I am with you today.

51:36.793 --> 51:37.294
So this is it.

51:37.374 --> 51:39.297
I hadn't thought of that until this minute, you know.

51:39.563 --> 51:41.945
But Bradley says, you know, people won't believe it.

51:42.065 --> 51:44.768
Even though I knew the man very well, I really didn't know.

51:45.289 --> 51:46.650
I didn't know.

51:48.452 --> 51:52.475
First of all, let's put it this way, although I would not want to be quoted on.

51:52.956 --> 51:58.461
I'm not here to judge his habits, but let's look at the mentality.

51:59.742 --> 52:05.628
Patriarchal family, where the man has certain rights and the woman has it.

52:05.648 --> 52:07.089
That's fewer, shall we say.

52:07.250 --> 52:07.630
Fewer.

52:08.032 --> 52:21.571
Now, in Europe, this would be considered fine because the Napoleonic Code, for instance, adultery, as you know, adultery is in the home everywhere for the wife and only in the home for the man.

52:21.971 --> 52:33.407
So ingrained in their culture was this patriarchal setup where the man was the owners of the whole thing and the woman would be there and cooking and suffering.

52:34.389 --> 52:37.633
It evolved, but still I think Jack...

52:38.187 --> 52:42.073
felt that he was a great fatalist.

52:42.954 --> 52:49.383
And he did, he always, I remember saying to him, you know, Mr. President, you shouldn't go to Texas.

52:49.944 --> 52:52.928
And he was, Adlai Stevenson was there, told him to also.

52:53.449 --> 52:55.492
Then he decided to go with an open car.

52:55.512 --> 52:56.894
You advised him?

52:56.914 --> 53:00.919
I didn't like the feeling, because he was going in really enemy territory.

53:00.939 --> 53:02.762
How many days was this prior to?

53:02.782 --> 53:04.164
Maybe three or four days.

53:04.184 --> 53:04.484
Really?

53:04.805 --> 53:05.005
Yeah.

53:06.014 --> 53:08.056
But I was not the only one, believe me.

53:08.357 --> 53:12.801
I remember Adlai Stevenson really saying, please don't go.

53:12.861 --> 53:13.542
Please don't go.

53:13.803 --> 53:16.165
I mean, it's very hostile down there.

53:17.847 --> 53:19.449
Listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

53:19.489 --> 53:20.470
You've given me an hour.

53:20.510 --> 53:21.631
I've got lots of tape.

53:21.651 --> 53:23.453
But I wonder, would you inscribe my book?

53:23.573 --> 53:25.035
I would love to.

53:25.055 --> 53:28.479
Surely, let me show you what I have to do.

53:29.119 --> 53:35.346
Because I think this has to be clearly not a book

53:35.815 --> 53:37.117
that was written to make money.

53:37.737 --> 53:39.540
I will not make any money, believe me.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.684
I've invested a lot of my own money because of the research.

53:42.704 --> 53:43.845
I had to get certain pictures.

53:43.865 --> 53:45.647
Oh, I saw the photo.

53:45.667 --> 53:47.510
I said, where did he get all these photo credits?

53:47.530 --> 53:49.993
I mean, I know a little bit about... You know how it is.

53:50.013 --> 53:51.154
I can't do it for my book.

53:51.254 --> 53:52.816
So it's only used 50 pictures.

53:52.896 --> 54:05.552
It is a parallel statement of a book that history will have because you will tell me and agree with me that the

54:05.988 --> 54:12.816
Personages in history that are the best remembered by us are those who had people writing about the event.

54:12.836 --> 54:20.245
For instance, Cortes would have never been Cortes in the mind of people if he hadn't had one of his soldier or writer.

54:21.126 --> 54:23.068
What would Socrates be without Plato?

54:23.508 --> 54:23.749
Right.

54:24.289 --> 54:26.091
Socrates never wrote a word himself.

54:26.151 --> 54:26.652
That's right.

54:26.672 --> 54:28.734
Plato was there taking everything down.

54:30.376 --> 54:30.957
Isn't that right?

54:31.017 --> 54:31.318
True.

54:31.378 --> 54:33.480
That's the point.

54:34.118 --> 54:37.101
Christ never wrote anything, if you think about it.

54:37.121 --> 54:38.062
No, it's true, never.

54:38.723 --> 54:43.728
It was written a hundred years later by other people, Greeks generally.

54:44.008 --> 54:44.268
That's right.

54:44.368 --> 54:47.591
I'm a Greek, by the way, proudly.

54:48.152 --> 54:52.036
I always remember this.

54:52.056 --> 55:04.108
When I have difficult moments in life, which we all have, I remember the ancient Greeks saying that hope is the last goddess, last good goddess.

55:04.527 --> 55:08.572
Remember that.

55:08.653 --> 55:18.105
It gives me courage because my life has been a difficult one, full of ups and downs in the sense of being a risk taker.

55:18.766 --> 55:19.908
Not everything is smooth.

55:20.949 --> 55:22.331
That's what makes it interesting.

55:23.332 --> 55:27.017
At this point I don't regret anything except my own personal stupidity.

55:29.721 --> 55:31.243
My own personal stupidity.

55:32.371 --> 55:34.693
I'll use some of these quotes if it's okay with you.

55:34.713 --> 55:35.674
It's okay.

55:36.135 --> 55:36.495
Please.

55:36.915 --> 55:47.986
Because in a certain way at my age, at this stage in my life, I can be of some consolation to some people that I doubt about the very nature of life.

55:48.707 --> 55:53.592
And sometimes I have the satisfaction to talk to people and they really listen to me.

55:54.233 --> 56:00.859
After all, with the experience I've had, varied experience, through wars,

56:01.362 --> 56:07.628
revolutions, lost money, even prestige, and going back to it.

56:08.109 --> 56:20.862
This is an American story of mine, because the only difference is from rich to poverty to riches, whereas most people have from ranks to riches.

56:21.843 --> 56:24.766
I have the other thing in the back.

56:25.466 --> 56:31.032
But, you know, when I first started, people said, he's of noble origins.

56:31.518 --> 56:47.416
That's a crime nowadays, to be a noble origin, because noble people of ancient ancestry are supposed to be idiots, supposed to be moronic, inbred, incapable of anything.

56:48.377 --> 56:51.881
I'm really a great believer in meritocracy.

56:52.142 --> 56:59.550
I believe, let's see what a man does, and then judge him by that, but certainly not be disqualified because

57:00.728 --> 57:03.792
Not of my fault that I was born to that particular milieu.

57:03.992 --> 57:07.216
Now let's be clear that where we speak is New York City.

57:07.236 --> 57:07.516
Yes.

57:07.656 --> 57:10.199
You don't make it in this city by noble lineage.

57:10.239 --> 57:12.121
You make it through achievement.

57:12.301 --> 57:13.182
Achievement.

57:13.263 --> 57:13.483
Only.

57:13.503 --> 57:15.465
If I'm right or wrong, this is... There's no other way.

57:15.545 --> 57:16.687
This is New York.

57:16.907 --> 57:22.193
This is Broadway in a larger... New York is the only real city left in the world, if you think of it.

57:22.253 --> 57:23.014
It's the only city.

57:23.394 --> 57:25.276
In good and in bad, it's there.

57:25.317 --> 57:26.618
The queen of all cities.

57:27.121 --> 57:33.913
I mean, you're not living in Monaco, you're not living in Paris, Florence, or any of these other wonderfully elegant places.

57:33.933 --> 57:37.259
Yeah, but... You're here, working, continuing to work.

57:37.279 --> 57:46.135
Can you just tell me a little... From where we sit right now, well, that's great stuff.

57:46.155 --> 57:48.960
I don't want to take up... I do know you have...
