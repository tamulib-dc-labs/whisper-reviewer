00:02.090 --> 00:16.791
Well, I was thinking that as you go to different countries for this research, you can see the history of libraries at different stages.

00:17.132 --> 00:17.793
That's the point.

00:17.893 --> 00:26.245
And thinking back to the NYPL, which began as a series of private libraries, I think in Brazil with Jose Mendelin, you can see... At that stage.

00:26.786 --> 00:27.507
At that stage.

00:28.162 --> 00:50.967
because countries like Brazil, although they have national libraries, and it's always occurred to me that when you found a new country, the first thing countries do is write a constitution, and the second thing they do is to create a national library in order to define a national literature and a common culture.

00:52.028 --> 00:55.131
So these countries create national libraries, but

00:56.697 --> 00:58.240
They don't create public libraries.

00:58.260 --> 01:04.049
And I think that's the great mystery that you might think about investigating.

01:04.069 --> 01:04.610
I love it.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.854
The public libraries.

01:07.716 --> 01:11.081
But I also think we're seeing the destruction of the public library right now.

01:14.247 --> 01:16.671
That's what I suspect you'll find when you look around.

01:17.372 --> 01:17.813
How do you mean?

01:18.213 --> 01:20.477
How has it been this morning?

01:21.166 --> 01:44.592
The great cultural move towards privatization of all things, and the move of the media companies to privatize copyright, to do away with copyright and fair use provisions and replace them with pure contract, is the destruction of the legal foundation of libraries.

01:45.044 --> 01:51.511
You know, now they want to ship books to us and shrink wrap cellophane with licenses on them that we can't use for the library loan.

01:52.332 --> 01:52.632
Really?

01:53.193 --> 01:58.358
So they're trying to close in on the book and turn it into a kind of closed terrain.

01:59.059 --> 02:00.060
Why do you think they're doing that?

02:01.161 --> 02:03.764
To protect the book as an object?

02:03.784 --> 02:14.916
No, because of this idea of intellectual property, which is they don't know what the future is, and they're trying to protect all of their future vets.

02:15.115 --> 02:18.659
in terms of future markets for information, multimedia markets.

02:20.561 --> 02:29.691
And they're trying to reverse engineer the very things about copyright law that have allowed libraries to, that is they're not only talking about new media, they're also talking about print.

02:29.711 --> 02:30.873
They're attacking fair use.

02:32.354 --> 02:35.478
They're attacking the first sale doctrine.

02:35.498 --> 02:42.726
So I think the Clinton administration's privatization of all kinds of public goods

02:44.090 --> 03:00.831
and the media companies attempt to completely commodify knowledge through new copyright laws and contract laws, I think we're seeing a real attack on the idea of a library as a public space and a public terrain.

03:00.851 --> 03:12.645
I'm not saying it's going to win, I'm saying I think that's the struggle, because you also see polities all across the country passing financing for wonderful new libraries.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.396
It's amazing, isn't it?

03:15.416 --> 03:18.180
That, you know, where people say that the library is dead.

03:18.921 --> 03:21.084
But look at the... Yeah, long live the library.

03:21.104 --> 03:22.926
Well, look at the, you know, everywhere, really.

03:23.046 --> 03:26.351
I mean, and I'm trying to visit as many of them as I can.

03:27.272 --> 03:27.873
We find that.

03:27.933 --> 03:34.401
I mean, I think it's a real misconstruction of the problem to say digital versus print.

03:35.082 --> 03:42.312
What we find with the online catalog and all these databases is people use print more.

03:42.663 --> 03:48.653
But MIT Press found when they published City of Bits online, they gave it away online.

03:49.174 --> 03:49.795
What was it again?

03:49.915 --> 03:51.397
City of Bits is the name of the book.

03:51.618 --> 03:53.260
City of Bits.

03:53.280 --> 04:00.813
It's a book by Bill Mitchell on the impact of computer technology on cities and city planning.

04:02.075 --> 04:08.265
MIT Press put it online, gave it away for free, and discovered they sold more print copies than they projected.

04:08.988 --> 04:13.412
Turns out online publication is like a marketing device.

04:13.432 --> 04:17.876
It helps people find the information, but people still want to buy the book.

04:18.417 --> 04:21.559
Do you think MIT Press would address themselves to that?

04:21.619 --> 04:21.900
I do.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.662
It's Bits, B-Y.

04:25.363 --> 04:26.224
B-I-T-S.

04:26.244 --> 04:27.345
City of Bits.

04:27.905 --> 04:30.187
Bill Mitchell.

04:31.128 --> 04:37.594
I think we don't know yet if computers and online information is the opposite of print, or if it's

04:37.912 --> 04:39.354
a new mode of communication.

04:39.455 --> 04:45.705
I personally think it's a complementary and will be a complementary medium.

04:47.989 --> 04:52.056
And that by and large, online information is going to increase the use of print.

04:52.136 --> 04:53.118
That would be my guess.

04:53.358 --> 04:55.041
Who knows, but that would be my guess.

04:55.542 --> 04:58.828
How long have you been, just biographically, how long have you been in this position?

04:59.269 --> 05:00.050
Three years here.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.434
Three years as university librarian at

05:03.140 --> 05:05.690
But I am not a librarian.

05:05.710 --> 05:08.199
I'm a political philosopher by training.

05:09.263 --> 05:11.833
And, you know, I do the kind of

05:12.016 --> 05:15.339
political anthropology of knowledge is my field.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.200
Really?

05:16.220 --> 05:18.322
And how I got into administration, I don't know.

05:18.342 --> 05:20.184
Well, you know, but it is interesting.

05:20.224 --> 05:22.927
You know, Billington is a historian.

05:22.987 --> 05:25.269
Paul Leclerc is not a librarian.

05:25.289 --> 05:27.692
Martin Gregorian is not a librarian.

05:27.992 --> 05:28.833
That's right.

05:28.853 --> 05:33.257
You know, Archibald McLeish is not a librarian.

05:33.898 --> 05:39.964
I mean, these are, the library is the site of some really interesting intellectual problems.

05:40.197 --> 05:45.893
So I think a lot of people from a lot of disciplines are attracted to this institution.

05:46.815 --> 05:53.132
All of these people I mentioned, by the way, I've interviewed already, Barton and Paul.

05:53.193 --> 05:54.797
They're all good friends of mine.

05:55.486 --> 06:11.767
You know, there is concern out here and in the world out there that maybe this university is drawing a lot of its resources towards the electronic and away from, I mean, they're not telling you something, anything you haven't heard.

06:11.787 --> 06:16.213
We spend 3% of our budget on digital works and 97% on print.

06:16.773 --> 06:21.139
That doesn't seem like some kind of a wild proportion to me.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.181
Does it to you?

06:23.824 --> 06:25.106
I didn't know those numbers.

06:25.146 --> 06:27.670
That's the fact.

06:27.890 --> 06:35.622
And of that 3%, most of it is for databases, abstracting and indexing databases, so people can use print collections.

06:36.804 --> 06:38.907
So it's a hysteria.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.615
But the facts are, we might go that direction.

06:44.276 --> 06:49.624
I think we face a major decision about our science journals

06:50.633 --> 06:55.398
We're being offered contracts to put three to 5,000 of our most important science journals online.

06:55.458 --> 06:59.082
And our problem there is that the inflation rate is well over 20% a year.

07:00.263 --> 07:09.233
And the issue is, and we're not getting any increases at all to our budget, which means every time it increases 20%, we cut 20%.

07:09.853 --> 07:10.875
That's the real problem.

07:12.336 --> 07:16.000
The library is no longer getting funding to build a collection here.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.924
So how much money did you get?

07:19.745 --> 07:21.526
Can you give me a number on that?

07:21.547 --> 07:23.208
We spent about $8 million on collections.

07:23.228 --> 07:34.278
$8 million, of which 3% is for, as you said, the electronic stuff, and now 7% of that is for print.

07:34.298 --> 07:41.264
If you buy a journal exclusively online and you decide to terminate it, do you still have what you bought three years ago, I wonder?

07:41.304 --> 07:42.885
Well, that's one of the big questions on my mind.

07:42.905 --> 07:44.907
That's why I've not signed any of these contracts.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.754
Who's going to preserve the digital?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.116
Who knows how to?

07:50.678 --> 07:53.961
Does it actually save money or does it cost more?

07:53.981 --> 07:56.664
Those are all unknowns.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.846
Will the inflation rate for digital be the same?

07:59.626 --> 08:04.431
But our real problem is, since 1989, we've had no increases for inflation.

08:05.792 --> 08:06.673
That's the real problem.

08:06.693 --> 08:08.094
It's not digital versus print.

08:08.134 --> 08:11.417
It's the fact the university isn't supporting the collection.

08:11.437 --> 08:13.139
Why do you suppose that is?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.320
Do you like to ask that?

08:15.734 --> 08:19.620
To whom would I address that question?

08:19.640 --> 08:22.084
President of the university, Dick Atkinson.

08:22.104 --> 08:22.524
What's his name?

08:22.725 --> 08:24.207
Atkinson.

08:24.227 --> 08:35.504
This was not his decision, because he's new, but since 89, up until 89, our collections were protected from inflation by the office of the president, and they have not been since 1989.

08:36.946 --> 08:42.214
So that's the real crisis, and I think it has to do with this culture that

08:42.970 --> 09:03.156
This myth that somehow digital is going to be free or cheaper, information will flow around, I think administrations all over the country have bought into a myth that somehow digital is cheap, free, and there's no evidence that that's true.

09:03.878 --> 09:19.559
And you think that this is something that's happening not just in California, but you think this is pretty much endemic to the whole... I think technology is the drug of choice of academic administrators.

09:19.639 --> 09:20.260
Exactly.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.264
Are you anxious about that?

09:23.384 --> 09:24.145
Does that bother you?

09:26.168 --> 09:29.532
Well, you know, I'm a social scientist, and I think it's...

09:30.254 --> 09:33.860
not based upon any real analysis of the facts.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.485
I know as much about technology as anybody does.

09:37.505 --> 09:52.208
I'm very interested in the new kinds of genres that can emerge from networked information, but I don't see them replacing print.

09:52.228 --> 09:52.989
You don't?

09:54.431 --> 09:54.912
I don't.

09:55.583 --> 10:05.540
I'm probably starting, it's just a chapter, a very exciting chapter, mind you, on the university libraries in the Harvard Depository.

10:05.560 --> 10:15.898
And then going around with Ken Carpenter as he goes and decides, you know, which books are going off to South Row and which is staying in Cambridge.

10:15.918 --> 10:17.762
It's a very, very basic situation.

10:17.802 --> 10:19.785
They have this philosophy at Harvard.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.542
There's no such thing as a dead book.

10:24.123 --> 10:28.087
They do admit to some grooming, but not necessarily weeding.

10:29.809 --> 10:37.736
They don't apply any two-year rules or three-year rules or five-year rules, as Michigan has suggested doing.

10:37.756 --> 10:43.301
If a book hasn't been written in five years, maybe we'd get rid of it or it goes off-site.

10:44.483 --> 10:50.228
I'd like to enter a general discussion, a philosophical discussion with you on this, or perhaps even policy.

10:50.748 --> 10:55.815
We have one of these remote storage things, too, here.

10:56.756 --> 11:00.221
I think this question about space deserves a lot of thought.

11:01.783 --> 11:08.953
That administrations all over the country are saying that they can't afford to build more library stacks in the center of campus.

11:08.973 --> 11:10.595
It's too expensive.

11:11.937 --> 11:19.928
What the people in humanities say is their mode of searching is browsing, and they want to browse through

11:20.195 --> 11:24.220
collections, and that it's part of being a public space.

11:24.601 --> 11:36.536
We have a new stacks here with compact shelving, and many of the faculty find it a real barrier to that kind of free browsing.

11:36.556 --> 11:37.097
A real what?

11:37.117 --> 11:37.557
What was the word?

11:37.617 --> 11:38.278
Barrier.

11:38.659 --> 11:40.881
A barrier, actually.

11:40.941 --> 11:45.087
To the free, kind of spontaneous browsing of the collection.

11:45.107 --> 11:47.670
The Calgary argument is we can keep a third

11:49.051 --> 11:52.235
more books, the extra 800,000 books on campus.

11:53.036 --> 11:59.004
So there's this question of, the space question is really a question of how you organize knowledge.

12:04.290 --> 12:16.746
Libraries are expensive, space is scarce, but I think it's a discussion about what you think the public, the library is a public resource, a common resource.

12:17.148 --> 12:27.303
There's football and the library are the two common points of a very increasingly specialized university.

12:30.007 --> 12:32.670
I think it's not just a question of inventory management.

12:32.690 --> 12:37.317
I think it's a question of community, philosophically.

12:38.815 --> 12:43.500
But now, I asked Charles, for instance, who do you see as, who do you serve?

12:43.520 --> 12:49.626
And, you know, he says, I, number one, serve the students and faculty of the University of California.

12:50.427 --> 12:58.216
And I suppose because you are a state-supported institution, you know, I guess you do exist to serve the public.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.016
Is this what you're saying?

12:59.097 --> 13:03.261
Or, I mean, you are fundamentally here to... No, I don't mean the public in that sense.

13:03.301 --> 13:06.104
I mean... Maybe you can define that a little better.

13:07.305 --> 13:08.046
I mean the...

13:09.730 --> 13:18.001
It's a public good for the university as a whole, is what I mean, that most of faculty and students' lives here is highly specialized.

13:19.122 --> 13:21.725
And the question is, what holds the university together now?

13:23.408 --> 13:30.897
You know, Clark Kerr was famous for saying, parking lot holds the university together.

13:31.218 --> 13:32.139
Clark Kerr.

13:32.740 --> 13:33.420
And he being?

13:33.801 --> 13:36.244
He was the former chancellor of this university.

13:36.545 --> 13:44.034
He wrote a book called The Uses of the Multiversity, defining the new university as a multiversity.

13:44.054 --> 13:44.995
This was in the 60s.

13:47.538 --> 14:04.257
And he worried that the parking lot, he didn't advocate this, but he worried that the parking lot, the question is, as the university becomes more and more diverse and more and more identified with serving society, what holds the university itself together as an academic community?

14:04.625 --> 14:10.370
And he worried that maybe the parking lot would be the only shared resource.

14:10.390 --> 14:16.376
I think the library is the other kind of shared intellectual resource that everybody holds in common.

14:17.817 --> 14:28.708
And one of the consequences of a digital library is everybody continues to stay in their lab or department or private spaces.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.250
They're not pulled into this common space.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.513
So that's what I meant by .

14:35.236 --> 14:42.627
Are you developing criteria for books that go offsite?

14:42.767 --> 14:44.370
Use is our criteria.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.712
So if a book's not used?

14:45.732 --> 14:47.474
If it's not used, it's put in storage.

14:47.715 --> 14:48.356
What's the number?

14:49.017 --> 14:51.140
A year, two years, three years, five years?

14:52.342 --> 14:55.466
You know, it's not that kind of a thing.

14:55.526 --> 14:59.893
Our space is so scarce that we

15:02.017 --> 15:14.831
You'll have to ask someone else about the exact numbers, but we put as many books on campus as we can, but the line is not one year, two years, three years.

15:14.891 --> 15:18.536
The line is what's least used and what's most used.

15:18.556 --> 15:20.638
But that's a subjective figure.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.001
No, it's a dynamic figure.

15:23.021 --> 15:23.581
It's a fact.

15:23.741 --> 15:25.463
It's not subjective.

15:25.483 --> 15:27.906
It has a book circulated as a fact.

15:30.046 --> 15:35.852
A book might circulate vigorously, but nobody's taken it out the year.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.595
It's just the luck of a draw.

15:38.816 --> 15:40.998
I hate to be fine on that.

15:41.018 --> 15:46.164
I don't understand that point.

15:46.184 --> 15:52.170
I mean, by use, we mean not only circulating, being checked out, but also being taken off the shelves and looked at.

15:53.332 --> 15:55.814
So what other measure of use would you suggest?

15:56.515 --> 16:00.019
Okay, I'll look at that slide.

16:00.472 --> 16:06.578
How many books do you have space for on campus?

16:06.598 --> 16:10.582
You have to ask a guy down the hall who has all of those numbers.

16:10.622 --> 16:11.043
Who's that?

16:11.283 --> 16:12.004
Bernie Hurley.

16:15.087 --> 16:16.749
Where is your off-site facility?

16:16.889 --> 16:17.550
It's in Richmond.

16:18.030 --> 16:18.791
Which is 20 miles?

16:18.851 --> 16:21.974
10 miles, maybe.

16:22.174 --> 16:23.135
What's the turnaround?

16:23.756 --> 16:24.757
You have to ask Bernie.

16:24.877 --> 16:26.599
I think it's twice a day, but I'm not sure.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.660
Oh, that's pretty good.

16:28.147 --> 16:34.297
We try and make it as fast as possible so that it's not a big inconvenience.

16:34.939 --> 16:37.062
How about deaccessioning?

16:37.222 --> 16:39.206
Do you have any deaccession books?

16:39.506 --> 16:40.187
Do you do reading?

16:40.268 --> 16:42.652
There is some reading.

16:42.712 --> 16:46.138
Most of the reading is in Moffat Library.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.800
It's the undergraduate library.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.443
We keep a parallel collection there.

16:50.244 --> 16:52.348
Those books tend to be utterly consumed.

16:53.493 --> 16:56.836
that is just torn apart, they wear out.

16:57.857 --> 17:06.385
We have a huge binding and preservation, but we tend to treat the undergraduate collection as a consumable collection.

17:07.086 --> 17:13.692
We tend to, and it's duplicates, so we keep a copy of record in the main stacks.

17:15.654 --> 17:21.559
By and large, we try to conserve the books, but I think there is a weeding

17:23.345 --> 17:29.093
process, but by and large we try and keep them.

17:29.113 --> 17:33.519
I've also been to Cornell, which is very actively involved in this digitization.

17:34.821 --> 17:50.382
They've really formulated the criteria for the faculty has input as to the relevance of a book, the importance of a book, whether it will be digitized, whether it will be sent someplace.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.891
come up with a phrase called phase deterioration.

17:54.071 --> 17:55.313
Have you ever heard of that phrase?

17:56.074 --> 18:16.487
Basically, it's a book that's approaching a very dangerous state, and the decision has been made that maybe it's not important enough to either repair or to de-acidify or remind, and also to scan so they're going to make it comfortable and do nothing heroic, I guess.

18:16.990 --> 18:25.918
but it'll be allowed to die, you know, to use that map for a natural death without any invasive procedures.

18:26.499 --> 18:28.321
What do you think of that?

18:28.341 --> 18:39.771
Is that something that you think makes... I mean, I would like to keep involved because I don't know what a future generation is going to think about our choices.

18:41.573 --> 18:44.255
But, you know, this is not a live question for me.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.137
My question is how to buy books.

18:48.817 --> 18:51.159
and the fact that our budget is declining.

18:51.319 --> 18:56.525
I put much more effort into the other end of the equation, building the collections.

18:56.565 --> 18:59.227
Well, that's important to you, by the way.

18:59.247 --> 18:59.368
Oh.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.189
Very important.

19:01.229 --> 19:03.071
The fact that you care about buying books.

19:03.912 --> 19:14.142
I mean, I think it's a horrendous and appalling mistake that this university is not supporting the buying books.

19:14.803 --> 19:17.946
We're supposed to be the collection of record for the state of California.

19:18.685 --> 19:23.672
So if we don't collect something, it means it probably does not exist in this state and in the West.

19:24.634 --> 19:28.820
We've historically been the repository for all the higher education in the West.

19:29.861 --> 19:32.165
We, Berkeley, and now the University of California.

19:32.826 --> 19:34.208
And they've just abandoned that.

19:35.730 --> 19:39.075
So we're buying fewer and fewer books every year.

19:42.881 --> 19:47.848
As the price of scientific journals has exploded,

19:48.858 --> 19:52.623
journals are pushing out the purchase of books.

19:52.663 --> 19:56.167
You know, I have to guard the boundary between the book budget and the journal budget.

19:57.349 --> 20:00.092
Because the journals, you know, it's an interesting thing for you to think about.

20:00.112 --> 20:04.938
They have a very high use for a very short period of time.

20:05.419 --> 20:09.244
Whereas the books have a very low use for a very long period of time.

20:10.726 --> 20:15.692
So for me, defending the book budget and raising endowments for the books and buying books

20:16.010 --> 20:24.780
has to do with representing the interests of future generations of faculty and students against the immediate demands of the sciences.

20:26.462 --> 20:33.230
So that's where I spend most of my time, is trying to defend the book collections.

20:33.250 --> 20:37.014
And I should probably worry about what's happening to them at the other end of the process more.

20:37.034 --> 20:39.557
No, that's excellent.

20:39.637 --> 20:45.544
I'm delighted that this is how you directed this particular conversation, because I've got this other thing.

20:46.098 --> 20:47.540
And this hasn't been addressed.

20:47.961 --> 20:52.648
And I commend you for being frank enough to admit that this is a problem here.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.369
That's a concern.

20:53.489 --> 20:54.250
It's not just here.

20:54.290 --> 21:04.125
This is true all across the country that science, technology, medicine, and business are the cash crops of universities.

21:04.165 --> 21:13.759
This is where the big professional schools are that serve the major leading-edge industries in the states.

21:14.009 --> 21:19.235
In our state and in other states, the scientists bring in income, grants.

21:21.277 --> 21:23.239
So their needs are very, very important.

21:23.299 --> 21:30.827
But by virtue of 20 percent inflation, and Harvard is the only academic library in the country that has kept up with inflation.

21:31.668 --> 21:33.651
Everybody else is buying less than they used to.

21:34.792 --> 21:40.438
But a lot of the way the science journals have been defended is by cutting the book budget.

21:41.228 --> 21:45.655
So nationally, the market for books is much smaller than it was for academic books.

21:46.356 --> 21:52.525
Even university presses are hesitant to publish highly specialized scholarly books.

21:53.226 --> 22:04.864
So what we're seeing is when I buy fewer books, I'm helping to dry up demand, which makes publishers stop supporting these obscure monographs.

22:05.865 --> 22:07.347
Not even obscure monographs.

22:07.768 --> 22:09.210
It's even worse than that.

22:09.562 --> 22:13.147
Books that might even sell to a 3,000 copies.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.589
Yeah, I was being ironic.

22:15.270 --> 22:20.238
I don't care if they're obscure, because sooner or later that's all part of the record.

22:20.939 --> 22:32.756
So I worry about this not just in terms of Berkeley, but in terms of we're kind of destroying the tradition of the book as the repository of scholarship by killing the market.

22:32.797 --> 22:34.199
So I worry about that a lot.

22:35.581 --> 22:37.864
Do you go to your superiors?

22:38.165 --> 22:39.467
and say, I need more money?

22:39.487 --> 22:42.672
I mean, you do this every single year.

22:44.395 --> 22:45.857
And it's an exercise, I gather.

22:45.917 --> 22:49.162
It's like you go in and you say I need money.

22:49.182 --> 22:51.446
And what do they tell you?

22:51.466 --> 22:53.729
They tell me that faculty salaries are more important.

22:55.612 --> 23:05.067
They tell me that the office of the president has decided that, well, I think tacitly they believe technology is going to somehow, I think tacitly,

23:08.168 --> 23:12.352
This book will be published in 1999, by the way.

23:12.532 --> 23:12.853
I will.

23:12.873 --> 23:14.054
I'll be long gone by then.

23:14.134 --> 23:15.355
Oh, don't say that.

23:15.675 --> 23:16.516
Oh, yeah.

23:16.576 --> 23:18.258
I'm not going to stay in this job.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.779
It makes me too angry.

23:21.161 --> 23:23.383
I'm a faculty member, and I'm going to go teach.

23:25.665 --> 23:29.549
This issue we're talking about makes me so angry.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.672
Fenton.

23:32.692 --> 23:33.653
This is your shot.

23:34.426 --> 23:36.329
And I promise you it's fair and accurate.

23:36.469 --> 23:38.974
I am very public about this, so everybody knows.

23:39.194 --> 23:40.035
Well, I don't have it.

23:40.316 --> 23:50.533
But I think this is tacitly a devaluation of the humanities and of many of the social sciences.

23:51.755 --> 24:00.990
But the choice to go with digital libraries, where digital libraries really serve is sciences, technology, medicine, business.

24:01.595 --> 24:07.322
Those are the forms of knowledge that map to this form of communication pretty well.

24:09.805 --> 24:15.752
So issues like preservation are not as important because the real value of the information dies out in three to five years.

24:16.673 --> 24:23.181
The information is in very short formats, often data, so that maps to computers.

24:23.842 --> 24:24.923
I have nothing against that.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.185
I think that's wonderful.

24:27.278 --> 24:35.608
But when you choose that as a replacement for books and print, what you're doing is choosing the sciences over the humanities.

24:36.650 --> 24:46.402
So I think what we're seeing, and this is what many faculty feel the battle for the library budget is about, we're seeing an academic priority being played out.

24:46.942 --> 24:50.667
It's not about books per se, and it's not about libraries per se.

24:51.127 --> 24:54.872
It's about the role of the humanities in the university, in my opinion.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.221
You're fine.

24:59.241 --> 25:02.684
You can keep talking.

25:03.725 --> 25:07.389
You gave a talk the other night in San Francisco, which I was unable to make.

25:08.090 --> 25:08.751
Yeah, I did.

25:09.071 --> 25:11.454
I'm so sorry I missed that.

25:11.474 --> 25:12.495
Are these some of the things?

25:12.535 --> 25:14.417
No, I forgot what I was talking about there.

25:14.497 --> 25:15.458
I give a lot of talks.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.081
I'm a very public person.

25:20.624 --> 25:21.805
What do you teach?

25:23.017 --> 25:25.800
I'm teaching a course on intellectual property right now.

25:25.820 --> 25:30.185
I teach in the sociology of knowledge in the School of Information Management and Systems.

25:30.745 --> 25:33.709
Is that formerly known as the library school?

25:33.809 --> 25:34.369
It used to be.

25:35.411 --> 25:38.474
Again, it's a rather disquieting trend, isn't it?

25:39.675 --> 25:42.158
Almost no research universities have library schools now.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.622
What's your response to that?

25:46.082 --> 25:51.268
Well, it's being turned into a clerical profession, tacitly.

25:54.286 --> 26:04.117
I think it's going to be very hard for us to hire librarians in the future because at an academic research library, the librarians are more than clerks.

26:04.798 --> 26:10.104
They really have to be able to participate in the intellectual life of the department to make these decisions.

26:11.826 --> 26:17.253
Many of our librarians have MAs and PhDs in the subjects that they serve.

26:17.353 --> 26:23.500
It's a deprofessionalization of librarianship.

26:25.403 --> 26:50.483
I think it's just part of the whole treating libraries as an inventory management problem, which is one of our functions, as opposed to being an academic subject, an academic department, a public space, and some of our other roles.

26:51.593 --> 26:52.775
the disappearance of libraries.

26:52.935 --> 26:58.902
I think public libraries are not disappearing, but in California, I think we now rank 50th in school libraries.

27:00.304 --> 27:01.345
Jesus.

27:01.366 --> 27:04.009
Do you mean in terms of numbers or in terms of percent?

27:04.109 --> 27:05.271
What do you mean?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.473
In terms of percent.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.755
I mean, we're a large state.

27:08.775 --> 27:09.155
You're here.

27:10.257 --> 27:12.340
It's a small country, really.

27:12.360 --> 27:12.620
Yeah.

27:12.640 --> 27:12.800
Yeah.

27:12.820 --> 27:15.564
Gary Strong is the former state librarian, told me this.

27:15.804 --> 27:18.007
He said we rank 50th in school libraries.

27:18.027 --> 27:18.968
He also told me that

27:19.538 --> 27:23.021
Libraries are mandated in the prisons in California, but not in the schools.

27:26.365 --> 27:26.445
Wow.

27:26.465 --> 27:43.421
And so public libraries have started to perform the function of school libraries, but to me there's something bizarre about Clinton and all of these people talking about networking the schools, which is all fine, but not talking about school libraries.

27:43.901 --> 27:47.004
It's all about access, but it's not about content.

27:48.125 --> 27:48.786
It's not about

27:49.222 --> 27:51.125
what's on the network.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.132
So that's another angle on this.

27:55.192 --> 28:00.121
The school library, which you may remember, I certainly remember it in mine.

28:01.123 --> 28:01.603
It's gone.

28:02.485 --> 28:04.949
It's gone in the state of California, by and large.

28:05.330 --> 28:14.706
Now, the public libraries have expanded their roles in that direction, but as you look at public libraries, you might pay attention to that, the relationship to the schools.

28:16.525 --> 28:19.789
For my kids, my kids went to school in L.A.

28:21.171 --> 28:26.797
It really worked for them to go to the public library and not the school library, but it's a major institutional shift.

28:26.817 --> 28:31.984
It's something that you might be aware of.

28:32.264 --> 28:34.587
I'm getting ideas here.

28:34.787 --> 28:37.150
It's still a work in progress, very much.

28:37.450 --> 28:41.774
I really want to explore the whole concept of the library.

28:42.035 --> 28:44.918
Did I talk about the historical thing?

28:45.118 --> 28:45.758
Yeah.

28:45.778 --> 28:46.819
I think that's very important.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.041
I really do.

28:48.922 --> 28:54.107
Even the physicality of a library, that's why San Francisco is of such tremendous interest to me.

28:54.487 --> 28:56.309
What the hell did they build over there?

28:58.331 --> 29:02.175
Now I'm thinking a little bit, maybe I'm from 3,000 miles away.

29:02.493 --> 29:05.456
very pretty, you know, as they say in the Dirty Desert, but can it fight?

29:05.476 --> 29:06.477
Can they fight, you know?

29:06.677 --> 29:07.758
Where the hell are the books?

29:07.919 --> 29:08.559
Where are the books?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.683
What in the world do they have in mind over there?

29:11.703 --> 29:12.744
Well, you should talk to Ken.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.766
One of the things he told me... Tonight at 7 p.m.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.046
Yeah.

29:15.066 --> 29:18.790
One of the things Ken told me... As a matter of fact.

29:18.810 --> 29:19.130
Yeah.

29:19.150 --> 29:20.972
Well, Ken is a smart guy.

29:22.534 --> 29:31.403
I mean, I asked him that... I got a tour of the library before it opened, and I asked him that question, and he said, well, he thought he could only take on one problem at a time in the polity.

29:32.007 --> 29:46.666
that the first thing was to get the library fixed in the public mind as a... You know, he's famous for seeing the library as a tool for communities and people that have access to government and these other functions.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.268
So I said, well, what about the books?

29:48.328 --> 29:53.755
And he said, I want, you know, this big garage under... I was there yesterday.

29:54.035 --> 29:55.337
50 photographs.

29:55.357 --> 29:57.880
He wanted the garage for his stacks.

29:58.248 --> 29:59.550
He was saying that to you then?

29:59.570 --> 30:01.192
He said that to me then, yeah.

30:01.212 --> 30:02.774
This was before it even opened.

30:02.794 --> 30:07.460
He said, I know it only performs some of these functions, but I figure it's the next thing.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.522
You can ask him about it.

30:08.562 --> 30:09.924
He wasn't unaware of that.

30:10.905 --> 30:13.168
But nonetheless, I think you're right to raise the question.

30:13.208 --> 30:15.631
If I were to build a library, I did build a library.

30:15.651 --> 30:18.075
I built one at USC, an undergraduate library.

30:18.175 --> 30:19.096
What was the name of the library?

30:19.256 --> 30:20.578
Levy Library.

30:21.099 --> 30:21.299
L-E-V-Y?

30:21.319 --> 30:22.140
L-E-A-V-E-Y.

30:22.220 --> 30:22.721
L-E-A-V-Y.

30:23.622 --> 30:24.984
I put all the computers in the basement.

30:25.024 --> 30:25.224
Really?

30:25.244 --> 30:26.025
And when did you do that?

30:26.746 --> 30:27.968
When I was down there.

30:28.758 --> 30:36.249
So how did, though, you're a sociologist, and how did you get into this?

30:36.349 --> 30:37.290
How did you come to this position?

30:37.310 --> 30:37.811
I don't know.

30:38.132 --> 30:38.552
I don't know.

30:38.893 --> 30:39.534
It's an accident.

30:39.674 --> 30:46.864
I've been studying since 77 what happens when you introduce computers into universities.

30:47.886 --> 30:49.068
It was a research project.

30:49.668 --> 30:50.309
And this was where?

30:50.630 --> 30:52.412
I was at Stanford at the time.

30:52.693 --> 30:55.918
I was a professor at Michigan State visiting at Stanford.

30:55.978 --> 30:57.600
I started just studying Silicon Valley.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.425
thinking that the computer was going to change the culture.

31:01.847 --> 31:02.508
Was I right?

31:04.170 --> 31:13.440
So I did a three-year study of 180 faculty at the humanities at Stanford just to discover how did this technology change the way they thought about the problems, their writing.

31:14.541 --> 31:15.543
This was a long time ago.

31:15.563 --> 31:18.266
It was the time of the invention of the personal computer.

31:18.866 --> 31:23.892
When I went back to Michigan State, I was a political theory professor, and I was

31:24.310 --> 31:28.478
one of the first people from the humanities to know a lot about computers.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.527
So they made me assistant director of the computer center, which was all run by engineers.

31:36.854 --> 31:42.985
So for a long time I was the humanities person in the computer center.

31:43.045 --> 31:46.572
Then my wife got a job at USC.

31:48.712 --> 31:52.637
The Barbra Streisand Professor of Sexuality and Intimacy.

31:52.657 --> 31:53.738
Come on.

31:53.758 --> 31:54.619
Could I make that up?

31:55.681 --> 31:56.081
Come on.

31:56.642 --> 31:57.363
The Barbra?

31:57.643 --> 32:00.547
Barbra Streisand Professor of Sexuality and Intimacy.

32:00.567 --> 32:01.288
Oh, great.

32:02.089 --> 32:10.479
It's an endowed chair for... Someone in Women's Studies, which is my wife's... Barbra Streisand Professor of... I want to write it down so it's not just a... Sexuality and Intimacy.

32:10.519 --> 32:14.905
This is a real-time... It'll be a while before I...

32:15.492 --> 32:16.854
And what's your wife's name?

32:17.014 --> 32:17.615
Barry Thorne.

32:17.976 --> 32:18.536
Say your name?

32:18.556 --> 32:20.339
Barry, B-A-R-R-I-E.

32:20.860 --> 32:22.502
She's named after Sir James Barry.

32:22.522 --> 32:23.464
Okay, oh great.

32:23.484 --> 32:25.066
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

32:26.388 --> 32:37.324
So we moved to USC and they put me in charge of, they wanted me to do a computer center for the humanities, which I called the Center for Scholarly Technology.

32:37.825 --> 32:41.550
It just blew everybody's mind.

32:42.290 --> 32:45.717
And then they asked me to be University of Liberia, and it came as quite a surprise.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.422
So you kind of backed into this?

32:48.823 --> 32:52.390
Yeah, I wouldn't have had the chutzpader to do this.

32:54.153 --> 33:00.045
But I'm one of the few academics who's done a lot of research on computers and the university.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.599
Will I be able to get a CV so I can check some of these publications and stuff?

33:05.619 --> 33:05.919
Sure.

33:06.340 --> 33:09.024
Did you see that issue of Dentalist, by the way, on libraries?

33:09.164 --> 33:09.525
I haven't.

33:10.065 --> 33:14.051
Because I wrote a thing on digital libraries in there.

33:14.592 --> 33:19.039
A lot of what I think about, what I've been saying to you is in there.

33:23.505 --> 33:24.967
I wrote you said one of them.

33:24.987 --> 33:26.069
You're an academic.

33:26.329 --> 33:28.092
I'm an academic.

33:28.865 --> 33:40.079
Both USC and Berkeley thought that with libraries changing, it needed more of an academic kind of perspective on it.

33:40.099 --> 33:41.241
Kind of an oversight perspective?

33:42.022 --> 33:48.049
Just somebody who I know a lot about technology, but I come out of the humanities.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.251
But you're not a techie, so to speak.

33:49.331 --> 33:49.711
I'm not.

33:51.073 --> 33:58.382
I mean, it's odd because my reputation at Berkeley is as being a techie, but in fact, I'm someone who's very skeptical

33:58.700 --> 34:01.365
in the good sense about technology.

34:01.385 --> 34:02.567
I think it's very promising.

34:02.827 --> 34:04.209
I would call it experimental.

34:04.230 --> 34:07.615
I would call digital libraries experimental.

34:09.879 --> 34:14.327
Have you ever seen that website DigiLive, that magazine?

34:14.347 --> 34:16.310
It's totally published there.

34:17.873 --> 34:21.940
I interviewed those people from Cornell.

34:23.067 --> 34:27.612
I'm bracketing this to date I started.

34:27.712 --> 34:30.756
I'll enter it, as I mentioned, with Harvard, but then I flashed to Cornell.

34:31.216 --> 34:32.178
That's a good contrast.

34:34.160 --> 34:40.567
I... That is a good interview.

34:40.607 --> 34:43.010
That is a good... I'm pulling a lot of that.

34:43.030 --> 34:45.073
It's a good contrast.

34:45.193 --> 34:47.235
Cornell's one of the...

34:47.992 --> 34:52.056
In a lot of ways, yeah.

34:52.076 --> 34:55.098
Cornell's one of the leaders.

34:57.100 --> 35:02.665
Well, Cornell is a funny place in that it's quasi-public, quasi-private.

35:05.168 --> 35:10.192
Another contrast that's quite interesting is between public universities and private universities.

35:11.233 --> 35:16.598
If you take a look at the national statistics, the ARL statistics,

35:16.898 --> 35:31.320
You'll see virtually all of the top ten libraries, all of the top privates are pulling away from all of the top publics in most statistics, collections.

35:31.780 --> 35:33.443
But at Cornell, I think it's going to go down.

35:34.424 --> 35:34.865
I think so.

35:34.885 --> 35:36.608
They made this principal decision.

35:37.629 --> 35:38.771
Which was defiant to me.

35:38.991 --> 35:44.880
By the year 2000, 6.8 million books will be 5 million books.

35:45.383 --> 35:47.585
My jaw dropped.

35:48.066 --> 35:50.128
They're very open about it, I give them that.

35:50.489 --> 35:52.070
No, they aren't.

35:52.150 --> 35:57.476
It would be easy for me to find a sitting university.

35:57.496 --> 35:59.298
Well, Michigan's another one.

35:59.378 --> 36:01.040
I would much rather have two Ivies.

36:01.661 --> 36:06.546
Two five-star, then we can bring the others in.

36:07.247 --> 36:11.712
Because then I think you really do frame the discussion in that manner.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.661
I hope you talk to Charles.

36:14.782 --> 36:25.380
There is another side of digital libraries, which is what they're doing in the Bancroft about digitizing archival collection is a great thing for medieval historians.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.865
I'm going to see Father Boyle in Italy in November.

36:28.105 --> 36:30.870
He sees the great example, isn't he?

36:31.852 --> 36:33.915
It's a great preservation technology.

36:33.935 --> 36:36.079
It's an access technology.

36:36.397 --> 36:40.242
There are niches in which technology is going to be very important.

36:40.302 --> 36:41.424
Scientific journals are one.

36:41.484 --> 36:43.386
I think archival collections are one.

36:43.907 --> 36:46.430
But it is not a replacement for books.

36:46.451 --> 37:00.529
Well, when I was at Cornell, again, they showed me a letter on the screen that Lafayette's young daughter wrote to President of Washington, General Washington at that point, inquiring about the health and welfare of her father.

37:00.549 --> 37:02.472
Lovely little letter, and I said that.

37:02.671 --> 37:05.537
And they have a great Lafayette collection there.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.098
I said, this is nuts.

37:06.118 --> 37:07.801
I'm telling you, is this thing sealed?

37:08.082 --> 37:09.424
You know, because they didn't have envelopes.

37:09.945 --> 37:11.729
I said, we couldn't tell that.

37:12.791 --> 37:13.773
Why is that important?

37:13.813 --> 37:14.073
That's wrong.

37:14.294 --> 37:20.646
First of all, how does this letter enter the collection with Lafayette when we know it was sent to Washington in the mail?

37:20.626 --> 37:22.508
You know, how is it addressed?

37:22.528 --> 37:24.731
You know, I mean, these are questions that I have.

37:24.791 --> 37:26.033
And then I said, well, I don't know that.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.275
Maybe we'll have to go look at the real letter.

37:28.756 --> 37:30.298
And then I said, I'm going to tell you what happened.

37:30.318 --> 37:31.820
And she did send it to Washington.

37:31.840 --> 37:37.947
And then Washington being childless and called in Lafayette and said, look at the letter I got from your daughter in Lafayette.

37:37.967 --> 37:38.408
It's moved.

37:38.428 --> 37:39.509
And he says, hey, you take it.

37:39.569 --> 37:41.191
That's how we got the letter.

37:41.211 --> 37:41.672
That's wonderful.

37:41.652 --> 37:46.838
That's my guess, but these aren't the questions that they have.

37:46.999 --> 37:51.424
Paul DeGood, who spoke with me, had a great example of that.

37:51.444 --> 37:52.305
He's in Portugal.

37:52.365 --> 37:53.347
Did he tell you that story?

37:53.807 --> 37:59.815
He's in Portugal reading letters from the New World and smelling for vinegar.

37:59.835 --> 38:01.276
I love that story.

38:01.697 --> 38:07.925
We have 26,000 images on the network of the history of California, which is great.

38:07.965 --> 38:10.528
School kids all over California can do research.

38:11.403 --> 38:15.809
And they would never have been able to do that before, and that's wonderful.

38:15.969 --> 38:30.911
And 99% of the people who would have looked at that letter can use the digital image as a full satisfaction, but they're still that person who will need to look at the paper, need to feel the paper, need to understand the providence.

38:32.233 --> 38:36.419
So it greatly expands the use of archives, but it certainly doesn't replace them.

38:36.459 --> 38:39.283
And if Cornell wants to throw away their archives, I'll take them.

38:40.004 --> 38:41.005
I'll take their books too.

38:41.255 --> 38:47.044
what they're doing, and I shouldn't tell you, just leave this for the moment, all right?

38:47.064 --> 38:53.755
I mean, but while I was there... No, I've got to go to a lunch.

38:53.835 --> 38:55.758
Can I call you?

38:56.479 --> 38:56.860
Oh, yeah.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.761
Can we continue this?

38:57.861 --> 38:59.323
Oh, yeah, sure we can.

38:59.404 --> 39:02.669
I've written a lot of stuff, not in this vein.

39:02.729 --> 39:05.874
I mean, you caught me in a ticked-off mood.

39:06.615 --> 39:07.937
About what?

39:07.985 --> 39:09.607
I like TikTok.

39:09.627 --> 39:10.487
TikTok moves into that.

39:10.808 --> 39:12.269
I just wrote something for the Mellon.

39:12.529 --> 39:17.054
It was a speech I gave there called Digital Documents and the Future of the Academic Community.

39:17.074 --> 39:17.654
Well, I have to have that.

39:18.115 --> 39:18.855
I think it's relevant.

39:19.396 --> 39:20.097
It's one of the things.

39:20.137 --> 39:25.081
The thing in Daedalus is kind of a very formal... I have Daedalus, but where can I get the Mellon?

39:25.101 --> 39:25.702
It's online.

39:25.722 --> 39:26.483
It's on the web.

39:26.523 --> 39:27.964
Well, how do I access it?

39:28.004 --> 39:28.505
I might have it.

39:30.707 --> 39:32.028
Did you use the web?

39:32.428 --> 39:32.668
Yes.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.372
I've been meaning to reread it now just on the web.

39:36.757 --> 39:38.862
Just tell me how to access it.

39:39.623 --> 39:48.403
Because you see these old things that have been damaged and consumed and they bring them to life.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.168
It's my very favorite place.

39:51.188 --> 39:51.709
Where is it today?

39:51.769 --> 39:52.230
Oh, it's close.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.816
Yeah, I'll walk you by it.

39:54.836 --> 39:58.062
Well, I'm not doing this until like one, but okay, yeah, I'll walk with you.

39:58.102 --> 39:58.543
How's that?

39:59.565 --> 40:01.389
Oh, you're printing for me now.

40:01.409 --> 40:01.710
Yeah.

40:02.130 --> 40:03.914
Well, good.

40:03.934 --> 40:05.076
You sound like a print kind of guy.

40:05.998 --> 40:09.345
Did you notice how pleased I am that you're doing this?

40:12.717 --> 40:19.205
This is a conference on, you know, Mellon is really behind digital libraries and economics of information.

40:19.766 --> 40:23.551
So I think it's worth going over and talking to Bill Bowen, head of the Mellon.

40:23.911 --> 40:24.232
Bill?

40:24.592 --> 40:27.476
Bill Bowen is head of the Mellon Foundation in New York.

40:28.277 --> 40:35.907
So this is a conference they had on digital libraries, on the economics, and I kind of

40:36.072 --> 40:39.155
So all of these papers are online, and here's the website.

40:39.215 --> 40:40.276
Outstanding.

40:40.296 --> 40:48.023
My paper is a real, hopefully, I tried to really, Digital Documents and the Future of the Economic Community.

40:48.483 --> 41:04.358
It's just a speech, so it's not one of my full-bore papers, but this is just saying that maybe they've left out most of the important questions in talking about, in economic terms, about what a library is.

41:04.726 --> 41:07.912
You'll see that I'm not anti-technology at all.

41:09.274 --> 41:12.179
I just think the terms of discourse are impossibly narrow.

41:14.062 --> 41:19.191
When's the best time to reach you on my phone when you're talking?

41:20.993 --> 41:25.779
Am I talking at home some night if I call you at home?

41:25.859 --> 41:29.684
Where's your home base?

41:30.065 --> 41:38.376
For a serious conversation, I usually make an appointment to talk on the phone just because I'm in this very bureaucratic job.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.298
I call to meetings all the time.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.122
It's very easy for her to block out half an hour.

41:43.382 --> 41:45.245
It'll be a while.

41:45.265 --> 41:47.187
I answer the email.

41:47.302 --> 41:47.943
Oh, good.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.084
You like email.

41:49.104 --> 41:49.404
I do.

41:49.604 --> 41:50.785
For messaging.

41:51.206 --> 41:51.867
Okay.

41:51.887 --> 41:54.489
Not for... No, no, no, no.

41:55.130 --> 41:58.253
I never... There are people who actually want to be interviewed by email.

41:58.553 --> 42:00.155
Bill Gates is one, for instance.

42:00.715 --> 42:01.356
Yeah.

42:01.376 --> 42:03.018
Well, that's an interesting mistake.

42:04.079 --> 42:12.007
That's a real... That's a wonderful... As a consequence, he's not going to be interviewed for my book.

42:12.027 --> 42:14.389
I mean, he doesn't interest me that much.

42:14.639 --> 42:17.864
We could talk about that for half an hour.

42:18.505 --> 42:21.088
That decision is something I know a lot about.

42:22.330 --> 42:25.936
Are you talking about his library decision or this decision?

42:26.657 --> 42:31.043
It's an interesting decision about what you think communication is and what you think knowledge is.

42:34.148 --> 42:38.674
There are studies of email communication called flaming.

42:39.756 --> 42:40.417
You know about that?

42:40.577 --> 42:41.478
Nope.

42:41.498 --> 42:44.022
There is a tendency for electronic mail

42:44.592 --> 42:49.339
exchanges to become extremely angry and out of control.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.342
It's called flaming well.

42:52.964 --> 43:04.121
And this is a typical thing I've learned as a manager, never answer an angry email from an employee, ever, because there is no way to resolve a conflict on email.

43:04.361 --> 43:08.828
Email is very good for messaging, exchanging messages.

43:08.888 --> 43:13.114
It's very good if you share a strong common culture and friendship with the other person.

43:13.533 --> 43:18.397
But if I answer an email, it will only escalate it, because it will get answered quickly, and why heed?

43:19.218 --> 43:20.519
No time for reflection.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.881
Once it's gone, it's gone.

43:22.961 --> 43:23.742
It's more than that.

43:23.982 --> 43:25.143
It's at least that.

43:25.904 --> 43:27.686
The question is, why does flaming occur?

43:28.526 --> 43:35.613
What context is stripped from human communication on email?

43:36.213 --> 43:37.915
Every technology strips context.

43:38.575 --> 43:41.818
The phone, for example, we know strips

43:42.862 --> 43:48.711
You get to see another person's facial expressions and body expressions, but you do get tone of voice on the phone.

43:49.392 --> 43:52.677
Well, there is, on email, no equivalent to tone of voice.

43:53.879 --> 44:05.997
If you were writing a letter, you could underline things, you could write it in italics, you could star it, you could write it in big... There are a lot of ways you can communicate nuance.

44:06.057 --> 44:08.861
And there's a period of time before you post it.

44:08.881 --> 44:10.484
And there's a period of time before you post it.

44:10.624 --> 44:12.126
All of that's stripped out in email.

44:13.102 --> 44:23.215
So it's a medium designed and optimized for the exchange of brief messages by people like scientists who share a common culture.

44:23.576 --> 44:26.740
You begin to use it as a common medium of exchange.

44:28.162 --> 44:32.087
It really has a very, very narrow spectrum of information.

44:33.589 --> 44:42.400
And so the choice of being interviewed by email to me is that here's somebody who isn't even aware of wide, broad spectrum

44:42.650 --> 44:46.915
of communication, of the importance of emotion, of nuance, of gesture.

44:48.197 --> 44:52.882
Why do you suppose I go into debt traveling the earth to do my interviews?

44:52.902 --> 44:58.449
I won't do them by the telephone unless I've met you and now we've met and we've talked.

44:58.589 --> 45:00.872
Now I don't mind asking you some questions on the phone.

45:00.972 --> 45:04.656
Those are exactly the terms in which email will work.

45:04.676 --> 45:10.463
You and I have enough knowledge of each other to interpret

45:11.185 --> 45:14.449
The missing information that occurs in email.

45:14.469 --> 45:17.554
And we also probably know enough to know when the email is breaking down.

45:18.054 --> 45:19.697
And it's time to call.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.120
It's time to call or even come out to California.

45:22.140 --> 45:24.603
Or come out to California.

45:24.743 --> 45:28.128
See, I'm an ethnographer by training.

45:28.489 --> 45:32.654
Ethnographer is someone who learns by participant observation.

45:33.475 --> 45:35.939
It's a form of anthropology.

45:37.982 --> 45:39.083
So the way I learn

45:39.974 --> 45:40.835
about anything.

45:40.955 --> 45:47.660
The way I studied computers was I watched people unpack them, and I took notes on the way they talk about them.

45:47.681 --> 45:48.561
You're an observer.

45:50.383 --> 45:56.128
So I'm very aware of, let's say, the non-informational aspects of communication.

45:57.209 --> 46:00.972
And the very same thing applies to the book, as you described it at Cornell.

46:01.152 --> 46:09.559
Extracting the information from its context is a loss of some kind of information.

46:09.944 --> 46:11.646
that the people at Cornell are not aware of.

46:11.706 --> 46:16.412
And your example of the envelope, or the vinegar, is that.

46:16.432 --> 46:19.095
I've got a bunch of, do you know a book called Paratexts?

46:20.216 --> 46:21.558
No, I think there's a footnote in my dental.

46:21.698 --> 46:22.298
Oh, I'll find it.

46:22.359 --> 46:23.160
McIntyre.

46:23.720 --> 46:25.142
He writes about bibliography.

46:25.582 --> 46:27.404
I'm having a chapter on bibliography.

46:27.685 --> 46:38.938
It's a wonderful thing about James Joyce, about when James Joyce did the page proofs for Ulysses, he wrote into Ulysses puns

46:39.323 --> 46:51.905
and references to the physical setting of the book, the layout of the book, the page number, so that when people republish it and treat it as information just to be decanted in some other way, they totally lose the meaning.

46:53.227 --> 46:56.934
MacIntyre is really a great writer.

46:57.414 --> 46:59.458
He's at Oxford.

46:59.995 --> 47:01.937
I get excited.

47:02.057 --> 47:04.639
I was thinking the same point that he knew.

47:04.659 --> 47:07.162
I mean, it's a perfect parallel.

47:07.262 --> 47:08.603
Is Ann there?

47:09.023 --> 47:11.025
She might be up front.

47:11.045 --> 47:14.549
Okay, because if she has a CV or something on her life, it would really help.

47:15.710 --> 47:19.473
I'll introduce you to Bernie on her way past.

47:19.914 --> 47:20.314
Bernie?

47:20.554 --> 47:20.915
Bernie.

47:20.975 --> 47:21.295
Bernie.

47:21.315 --> 47:28.922
The guy who, he did no longer this, but he was in charge of the methodologies by which

47:29.257 --> 47:32.280
The books were kept in storage.

47:33.862 --> 47:44.955
I haven't paid much attention to that because I didn't... That was great.

47:44.975 --> 47:45.175
Wonderful.

47:45.195 --> 47:53.424
I thought of these things that we just go in and say, well, we'll put away those again.

47:53.444 --> 47:54.526
He's not in.

47:54.546 --> 47:55.847
Is that going out?

47:57.449 --> 47:58.470
Yeah.

47:59.007 --> 48:02.150
Mr. Ogden is in this building.

48:02.170 --> 48:11.239
You mean, I was going to put you in his lab and I can't remember his office.

48:11.259 --> 48:13.281
You know, if he's in this building, I'll find him.

48:13.681 --> 48:25.993
Four or six years ago, basically, I'll show you where the yellow is.

48:36.723 --> 48:57.594
And I came up with two hours of pace.

48:57.614 --> 48:58.075
So I've got three guys.

48:58.095 --> 48:58.235
Thanks.

48:58.255 --> 48:58.996
I've already introduced these people.

48:59.016 --> 48:59.337
Interesting man.

48:59.357 --> 48:59.457
Yeah.

49:05.782 --> 49:30.739
I can get you in there later.

49:30.759 --> 49:31.340
I can get you in there later.

49:31.360 --> 49:31.941
I can get you in there later.

49:33.153 --> 49:50.866
Where is it?

49:50.886 --> 49:51.347
Over in the South Pole.

49:51.367 --> 49:51.708
We're in college.

49:51.728 --> 49:52.309
That's not a good way around.

49:52.677 --> 50:08.121
Well, it's very, very interesting.

50:08.141 --> 50:20.220
I really have to point out, I think I have an idea, and as you get really good stories, I think that's a good point.

50:24.689 --> 50:27.353
Hundreds of kids come.

50:27.373 --> 50:29.075
This is one of the things a library is for.

50:29.115 --> 50:32.800
It's not just the whole books, it's the culture of reading.

50:34.082 --> 50:37.467
What we're looking at here is the Morrison Library.

50:37.487 --> 50:38.328
There are dozens.

50:41.012 --> 50:42.754
There's a poet in there giving a reading.

50:42.794 --> 50:47.261
That's the poet laureate.

50:47.521 --> 50:48.923
Yes, it is.

50:48.943 --> 50:50.365
The poet laureate of what?

50:50.625 --> 50:53.129
The former poet laureate.

50:53.329 --> 50:53.970
He is?

50:54.490 --> 51:02.842
You didn't catch me on a well day, you know.

51:02.862 --> 51:04.424
Yeah, no, no, you'd be surprised.

51:04.444 --> 51:06.648
Sometimes that's, that's I'll find out.

51:06.688 --> 51:10.734
Guess what, no problem.

51:10.794 --> 51:20.147
Okay, and you know, you have places like the University of Michigan where their new building isn't even called a library.

51:21.549 --> 51:24.193
You know what, I call it the L word.

51:24.646 --> 51:26.634
People are afraid to use the L word.

51:27.075 --> 51:28.119
Which is a library.

51:28.139 --> 51:30.147
Library.

51:30.167 --> 51:31.733
Let's leave it at that one.

51:31.753 --> 51:32.897
Thanks a million.

51:32.978 --> 51:34.403
We'll be in touch.
