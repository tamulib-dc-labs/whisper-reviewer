00:04.672 --> 00:08.995
Have you had a chance to read or to look at

00:10.156 --> 00:13.021
The Elizabeth Bishop letters?

00:13.141 --> 00:15.785
I have them, but I haven't had a chance to look at them.

00:15.805 --> 00:18.169
They're just wonderful, of course.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.691
No, I have them.

00:19.731 --> 00:20.913
I have them at home.

00:20.993 --> 00:28.145
In fact, I did an interview with Mr. Giroux a couple of weeks ago.

00:28.225 --> 00:29.467
Would you like coffee?

00:29.587 --> 00:30.008
Some coffee?

00:30.108 --> 00:30.909
Oh, yes, I would.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.173
I'd like coffee.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.657
Oh, thank you.

00:35.637 --> 00:55.120
I wonder, you know, she... There are some parallels, I think, in perhaps a superficial way, but really, in terms of this work ethic and this... The woman produced maybe 80 poems, I guess, but she was always striving for that.

00:55.140 --> 00:59.966
And if you read these letters, there's this sense of perfection.

01:00.106 --> 01:01.948
No, I've been really...

01:02.384 --> 01:07.290
I've been waiting to get them to read them, putting everything.

01:08.251 --> 01:09.593
I said some of this in your writing.

01:10.975 --> 01:12.156
Oh, all right.

01:12.236 --> 01:13.718
Do you see where I'm going with this?

01:13.738 --> 01:22.489
I wonder if there's this same passion for precision that... Well, I'm kind of particular.

01:22.509 --> 01:27.075
I mean, I do do a lot of...

01:27.528 --> 01:28.970
That's fine.

01:28.990 --> 01:32.195
I'm just going to direct you to fix it.

01:32.255 --> 01:34.958
I mean, I do do a lot of revising.

01:35.639 --> 01:50.380
I mean, I do do a lot of... You see, I think what it is, in a way, I'm not saying this may not have anything to do with Elizabeth Bishop, but when I first write something down, it's all wrong.

01:52.423 --> 01:56.168
It's almost always wrong.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.731
So I have to do a lot of work.

01:59.751 --> 02:00.993
I mean, there's no way out for me.

02:01.453 --> 02:06.240
Let me just interject what Mr. Giroux said about Elizabeth.

02:06.280 --> 02:12.347
He said she would be working on a story or a poem and do five or six versions and say it's all wrong.

02:12.387 --> 02:14.450
There you are.

02:14.831 --> 02:19.877
He said some of these stories which he gathered in the collected prose should

02:20.279 --> 02:22.162
Everyone was brilliant.

02:22.202 --> 02:24.025
Good to see what was wrong.

02:24.065 --> 02:26.969
That could be true for her.

02:29.493 --> 02:34.901
My feeling is that I don't get it right.

02:35.041 --> 02:37.405
It takes me time.

02:37.445 --> 02:39.027
Therefore, I do do a lot of work on it.

02:39.228 --> 02:42.152
I am after something.

02:42.655 --> 02:45.519
What is it that, I mean, is it the language or that?

02:45.659 --> 02:58.397
No, it's like, it's not, you write something down and you write it, you write maybe half a story or a third of it or a page or a paragraph and you haven't said what you mean.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.082
So there's two things.

03:02.162 --> 03:10.013
There's meaning that you don't have right, you know, you're going to hear all about John Cage on that.

03:10.482 --> 03:35.746
It's not that everybody has to do that.

03:35.826 --> 03:37.688
Some people get it right.

03:38.157 --> 03:39.820
So there's two things.

03:39.860 --> 03:44.307
There's the meaning, and if you don't get the meaning right, you're missing the meaning.

03:44.768 --> 03:46.170
I have to get the meaning right.

03:46.951 --> 03:49.375
I have to be true to what I'm thinking about.

03:50.557 --> 03:55.525
And then as far as the writing is concerned, it's closely related.

03:56.062 --> 04:01.872
you know, I'm using the wrong words, maybe that's why, that's why my meaning isn't coming, isn't right.

04:01.892 --> 04:10.086
Well, we're talking about meaning now, we're talking about what I think is true, what I think is right, what I think is wrong.

04:10.487 --> 04:12.130
Is this story for you

04:12.869 --> 04:15.533
an expression of meaning, or is it a story?

04:15.653 --> 04:17.376
Where do we start?

04:17.396 --> 04:19.218
Oh, so they're a little bit different.

04:19.639 --> 04:31.877
I mean, mostly they start with, most stories start with someone saying something, with some resonant paragraph or sentence or something like that.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.679
With one of your two ears, you're saying.

04:33.699 --> 04:36.864
Yeah, one of my, right, yeah, I read about my ears, yeah.

04:38.086 --> 04:42.572
And it usually starts like that, and then I, um,

04:42.738 --> 04:50.150
And then what happens after that is usually I put it down and don't look at it again for a while.

04:50.471 --> 04:51.232
For like a while?

04:51.512 --> 04:52.193
Well, it depends.

04:52.253 --> 04:56.040
I mean, I might not look at it for a year or I might not look at it for a day.

04:57.041 --> 05:06.416
But then when I go on... Also, I'm sure there's a comment on most writers.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.378
I don't really...

05:07.628 --> 05:11.373
I don't know what direction I'm going in exactly.

05:11.553 --> 05:18.903
So when I say it's not true to a meaning, it's hard to answer that, because if I don't know where I'm going, how do I know my meaning is wrong?

05:19.083 --> 05:29.036
But still, that's the way it is.

05:29.116 --> 05:31.780
Except with that.

05:32.789 --> 05:46.004
And this, at the beginning of the new collection, which is three collections actually, you point out that somewhere around 1954 or 55, something happened.

05:46.525 --> 05:47.005
Right.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.728
And I wonder if you could maybe expand a little bit on that.

05:49.748 --> 06:00.180
Well, one of the things that happened was I thought I wanted to write some stories.

06:00.430 --> 06:03.274
My kids were, we were just talking about how old my kids were.

06:03.294 --> 06:05.637
They were about six or something like that, seven.

06:06.318 --> 06:11.925
And I just felt that I wanted to write more, write seriously in a sense.

06:12.046 --> 06:21.418
Although I'd always written poems very seriously, but with no idea that I was going to ever publish them or anything.

06:21.719 --> 06:25.324
I mean, I had published about three poems when I was about 20.

06:26.205 --> 06:28.047
And then I never did again.

06:29.269 --> 06:30.150
But I always wrote.

06:31.177 --> 06:33.700
But I felt I had to do something.

06:34.962 --> 06:39.969
I'm curious.

06:40.189 --> 06:41.270
You felt you had to.

06:42.492 --> 06:43.854
I'll tell you why in a minute.

06:43.914 --> 06:47.158
I felt I had to do something for two reasons.

06:47.338 --> 06:58.433
A very material reason, in a sense, was that I was about to be pressed

06:59.155 --> 07:00.777
into becoming a film editor.

07:01.518 --> 07:02.660
My husband wanted to film.

07:02.680 --> 07:08.268
I don't think I would have told that whole story, but anyway.

07:08.328 --> 07:11.012
It was about to be, and I really didn't want to.

07:11.252 --> 07:14.197
I didn't want to do anything like that, you know.

07:14.217 --> 07:21.808
And I began to think about stories, and somebody, a friend of ours, read a story to us, and I thought, why don't I write a story?

07:21.888 --> 07:24.792
Now, I had tried to write a story many years before, and

07:25.177 --> 07:30.082
in a class at NYU, and he told me I didn't know how to write and I couldn't do it.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.744
So I said, okay, I don't know how, so I won't.

07:34.866 --> 07:36.508
So that's one part of it.

07:36.548 --> 07:45.357
At the same time, I had become very interested in women's lives.

07:46.418 --> 07:50.982
I was not only interested, I began to be very upset about it.

07:51.839 --> 07:56.263
I really began to worry about it a lot.

07:56.864 --> 08:05.913
This was in relation to the men I knew, you know, and what I felt their attitudes had been, and all these boys I had loved really.

08:06.634 --> 08:07.775
I'm not talking about lovers.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.998
I mean, my husband and his friends.

08:11.138 --> 08:13.280
I love these guys.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.022
But I really love these guys.

08:15.082 --> 08:18.285
I've lived in army camps.

08:18.890 --> 08:22.397
And I knew some of them from the war.

08:23.259 --> 08:28.029
But I was really, really very distressed about it.

08:28.069 --> 08:30.294
And it was not that I was distressed.

08:30.334 --> 08:31.296
I lived in a village.

08:31.529 --> 08:36.754
and I went to the park with a lot of these women, and they were all single women ahead of them.

08:36.774 --> 08:40.138
I mean, my environment was ahead of the game, so to speak.

08:40.158 --> 08:44.983
There were a lot of single women there, you know, along with kids.

08:45.003 --> 08:46.865
They were very young and dumped.

08:46.885 --> 08:47.806
Single mothers, actually?

08:47.826 --> 08:49.908
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I mean, single mothers.

08:50.548 --> 08:51.590
A lot of them were divorced.

08:51.610 --> 08:52.911
Some of them had been dumped.

08:52.951 --> 08:58.937
Some of them had been, you know, just went away, did it on their own, you know, whatever it was.

08:59.204 --> 09:01.428
But they were along with children, a lot of them.

09:02.470 --> 09:06.917
So they were very interesting to me, and their children were, too.

09:09.201 --> 09:17.415
But this kind of distress that happens before you write something, which I think everybody describes in some way like that.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.959
And I thought I'd write about lip.

09:19.979 --> 09:24.587
I thought I'd start writing some of these stories.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.813
At the same time, I thought, you know, nobody will be interested.

09:28.873 --> 09:33.819
It's just about a bunch of women, and nobody will be that interested.

09:34.379 --> 09:41.989
I've described that in court, because the 50s was a very masculine period in literature.

09:42.109 --> 09:46.795
I'm trying to find if there's any other writer doing here.

09:47.011 --> 09:49.313
the stories that you're doing.

09:49.433 --> 09:53.397
I can't think of anybody offhand at that time.

09:53.597 --> 09:58.342
Well, Phileosa's book came out in 1960, Tell Me a Riddle.

09:58.482 --> 10:01.245
She's written that.

10:01.505 --> 10:04.208
I mean, strictly from a woman's sensibility?

10:04.248 --> 10:05.409
Yeah, well, yeah.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.311
I haven't read Phileosa.

10:07.411 --> 10:08.051
Oh, you should.

10:08.071 --> 10:09.473
Oh, you read Tell Me a Riddle.

10:09.753 --> 10:10.934
You know Tell Me a Riddle?

10:11.174 --> 10:12.816
Oh, you'll die of weeping.

10:12.796 --> 10:21.847
But it's really a back, it's a back, it's a, in a way, just like my, the first story I wrote was Goodbye and Good Luck, and it was not about my generation.

10:22.388 --> 10:37.707
It was about my, it came, it was not the true story, but it was about this, these spinster ants who floated through both my life and my husband's life, you know, all these, these ants who never married and who were really,

10:38.362 --> 10:42.408
And dealt with a small amount of contempt for that reason.

10:42.969 --> 10:48.316
So I went back first before I went forward.

10:50.960 --> 10:56.548
But I worried a lot anyway about whether it wouldn't be considered too trivial and so on.

10:56.628 --> 10:58.831
But I really had a lot of pressure to do it.

10:58.951 --> 10:59.512
So I did it.

10:59.672 --> 11:01.375
And I thought, well, what the hell?

11:01.395 --> 11:02.096
Internal pressure.

11:02.236 --> 11:03.117
Internal pressure.

11:03.177 --> 11:03.838
Nobody else.

11:04.419 --> 11:06.142
There was no pressure from anyone.

11:06.162 --> 11:07.744
My husband liked the idea of me.

11:08.062 --> 11:09.585
My former husband.

11:09.605 --> 11:13.733
But he liked the idea of me writing stories, because he didn't mind poetry so much.

11:13.813 --> 11:16.478
I mean, he really didn't think it was so great.

11:16.498 --> 11:17.179
He didn't hate it.

11:17.660 --> 11:18.582
He was in music.

11:18.642 --> 11:22.409
Music was his thing, and film.

11:23.431 --> 11:24.513
But he encouraged me.

11:24.533 --> 11:28.500
He said, why don't you write some stories, for God's sake?

11:28.480 --> 11:33.067
with the idea that you'd published them, or was it more or less... Well, it was two things.

11:33.107 --> 11:34.970
It was also that he knew I wrote anyway.

11:35.671 --> 11:41.499
So it was one, encouraging me to write, and then saying, you know, someone might bring them in one of them.

11:41.519 --> 11:44.003
Well, you tell the story about Kim McCormick, that's quite a story.

11:44.023 --> 11:46.587
Well, that's the most lesser thing that happened.

11:46.767 --> 11:52.716
I mean, I would never have... I can't imagine that I would have...

11:53.033 --> 11:56.957
that what has happened to me would have happened to me without Ken.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.299
You want me to tell it on you?

11:58.319 --> 11:58.679
Sure, sure.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.142
I mean, because you know it already, so should I tell it?

12:02.784 --> 12:03.224
Yeah, let me help.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.185
She doesn't know it.

12:04.325 --> 12:04.606
I do.

12:04.626 --> 12:05.086
Oh, you do?

12:05.106 --> 12:05.527
She doesn't.

12:05.547 --> 12:06.608
Oh, okay.

12:08.290 --> 12:17.640
Well, what happened is I used to have these kids, you know, my children's friends, and so were these two children, a little girl and a little boy, both older than my kids,

12:18.160 --> 12:20.022
And they would come in to look at television.

12:20.142 --> 12:22.304
And their mother lived down the way.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.986
And she was divorced from their father.

12:25.026 --> 12:28.149
And we were a little mad at him.

12:29.150 --> 12:31.693
And he would come sometime.

12:31.733 --> 12:34.515
He'd come on Fridays to take them for the weekend.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.978
And we lived really in a basement then.

12:36.998 --> 12:40.361
So in my eyes, what I remember is this dark basement.

12:40.381 --> 12:41.622
Really, really dark.

12:41.642 --> 12:43.784
And these little kids.

12:43.844 --> 12:44.985
Yeah.

12:45.005 --> 12:46.046
Isn't that an earthquake?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.948
The building feels like it's shaking, does it?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.752
I'm sorry.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.434
It's like an earthquake.

12:51.454 --> 12:52.015
It is, look.

12:52.035 --> 12:52.796
It's not an earthquake.

12:52.896 --> 12:54.538
Look, the building's shaking.

12:54.719 --> 12:58.644
Maybe there's a subway that goes out to you.

12:58.804 --> 12:59.385
Maybe what?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.848
Everybody's saying maybe, but they don't know.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.930
This man doesn't know shit.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.191
He's just talking.

13:05.613 --> 13:06.695
It's still shaking.

13:06.895 --> 13:10.620
But maybe... Can we work a little bit?

13:10.640 --> 13:11.281
Yes.

13:12.583 --> 13:12.703
Great.

13:13.055 --> 13:42.201
Well, so anyway, he came in and he sat down in our armchair and these little kids have these very heavy

13:42.620 --> 13:46.405
earphones on because my husband didn't want to hear the television.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.187
So there were four of them sitting there.

13:49.028 --> 14:00.783
And then he finally looks at me rather starkly and says, my Tibby, he didn't say my wife, Tibby says that you've written three stories and I should read them.

14:00.843 --> 14:05.209
This has never happened today, I can tell you.

14:05.229 --> 14:07.732
So I said, really?

14:07.812 --> 14:08.313
Okay.

14:09.034 --> 14:11.377
Are you sure you want to read me?

14:11.677 --> 14:12.238
I'll read them.

14:12.556 --> 14:13.298
I'll read them.

14:13.659 --> 14:19.213
So he took them and he read them.

14:19.233 --> 14:24.928
And the next week when he came for the kids, he said, if you write seven more, I'll publish a book.

14:25.128 --> 14:25.889
Isn't that wonderful?

14:26.629 --> 14:29.292
I mean, it was the most wonderful thing that could have ever happened.

14:29.312 --> 14:29.492
Yeah.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.117
And if it hadn't happened, I don't know if I would have written a book.

14:34.197 --> 14:36.419
I might have written another two stories.

14:36.459 --> 14:42.765
Are you probably would have written and they would be someplace in a desk drawer?

14:42.785 --> 14:47.650
Well, not only that, he also said something very important to me, which showed how much he knew.

14:48.431 --> 14:50.953
He said, we'll publish the book.

14:51.454 --> 14:53.616
Don't worry about that.

14:54.001 --> 14:57.384
It gave me some pittance of a— This is it, by the way.

14:58.225 --> 14:58.846
Oh, it is.

14:58.986 --> 15:00.067
Oh, I love that book.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.729
Whenever I see it, I want to cry.

15:02.770 --> 15:03.451
I've had it for ten years.

15:04.452 --> 15:05.633
Oh, that's nice.

15:05.653 --> 15:06.454
So you can see I'm a man.

15:06.474 --> 15:06.614
I see.

15:06.714 --> 15:07.535
That's great.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.797
I'm going to ask you to sign it before we do it.

15:09.917 --> 15:10.438
Okay, yeah.

15:10.458 --> 15:11.779
No, that book is very touching.

15:13.141 --> 15:19.367
So he said, but nobody will publish the stories.

15:19.499 --> 15:25.368
You'll send them out, but you'll see they won't be published.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.094
Why did he suppose he felt that way?

15:29.114 --> 15:32.479
He knew something I didn't know, because I promptly began to send them out.

15:34.082 --> 15:37.367
They promptly began coming back from every magazine you could think.

15:37.888 --> 15:43.617
I mean, you would have think the kind of magazine that commentary was at that time.

15:44.018 --> 15:47.764
When my last book came out, it had like a six-page attack on me.

15:47.864 --> 15:52.210
But at the time, you'd think they would have taken goodbye and good luck.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.155
I mean, those stories seem so natural.

15:55.796 --> 15:59.542
Send them back without a fuzzy word or maybe try it again.

15:59.962 --> 16:03.007
There wasn't a magazine that took them.

16:03.287 --> 16:08.355
And finally, finally...

16:08.555 --> 16:11.679
Do you think you were saying things to people that these editors didn't want to hear?

16:11.759 --> 16:14.824
Well, to me, I can't think.

16:14.844 --> 16:21.413
If I tell you that, well, the stories were Goodbye and Good Luck, the contest.

16:21.673 --> 16:23.155
Wonderful stories.

16:23.175 --> 16:30.866
And one other, it was either a woman, young and old, or The Loudest Voice.

16:31.107 --> 16:34.311
I mean, that's such a kosher story.

16:34.331 --> 16:36.674
Did you ever think that you were a pioneer?

16:36.694 --> 16:37.195
No.

16:37.799 --> 16:43.227
I thought the New Yorkers would love The Loudest Boys.

16:43.388 --> 16:50.379
I mean, I remember sending this out in 1958 or something.

16:52.021 --> 16:53.243
So he was right, that's all.

16:53.383 --> 16:58.111
But I wasn't worried, because I was getting a book out, so I was not in despair or anything.

16:59.112 --> 17:03.179
And I was sort of amazed that he knew so much, you know.

17:03.519 --> 17:04.060
He knew.

17:04.630 --> 17:14.710
But then I began to send him to Quarterly, a little bit, and Accent took the Blind Good Luck and the Contest right off the bat.

17:16.353 --> 17:16.874
They took it.

17:18.357 --> 17:20.721
And that was a magazine at the University of Illinois.

17:21.423 --> 17:27.735
So I also, you know, when I would once in that tenure see those guys,

17:28.205 --> 17:31.889
Parker Quinn and a couple of other, Dan, I forgot his name.

17:32.190 --> 17:32.991
I think about that.

17:33.591 --> 17:36.455
But those two were taken.

17:36.495 --> 17:44.524
When you, there was a piece in the review on the Times, a little sidebar, and you recorded it saying, well, don't ask me anymore about the novel.

17:44.824 --> 17:48.348
I'm not, I'm going to ask you anyway.

17:49.630 --> 17:57.739
Well, I love, oh, there's one thing Ken did, and it's very funny, many years later when I met him, he heard me talk

17:57.938 --> 18:02.628
He had something I was talking about, you know, and I said that I'd been asked to run a novel.

18:02.648 --> 18:03.509
He came up to me later.

18:03.529 --> 18:06.014
He said, we made a bad mistake doing that.

18:06.095 --> 18:06.916
I'm very serious.

18:06.936 --> 18:08.399
We made a bad mistake, Grace.

18:09.842 --> 18:11.425
We made a bad mistake?

18:11.546 --> 18:15.153
He meant he, we, he meant Doubleday, I guess.

18:15.173 --> 18:17.618
I don't know, because they said to me, now write a novel.

18:18.037 --> 18:20.900
And I'd been very obedient at that point.

18:21.020 --> 18:22.401
So you would have, you think?

18:22.421 --> 18:22.802
I did.

18:22.862 --> 18:23.302
I worked.

18:23.342 --> 18:25.564
I didn't do stories.

18:25.624 --> 18:26.926
I did a novel.

18:27.066 --> 18:30.409
I worked on a novel for two years at least, maybe more.

18:31.630 --> 18:32.571
And it wasn't good.

18:32.591 --> 18:38.417
I mean, at least the only good thing about me is that I had brains enough to know that it was crummy.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.599
Where is it?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.901
Well, I used parts of it in different stories.

18:43.001 --> 18:45.023
Some of it, some of it, um...

18:45.863 --> 18:53.211
I'm trying to remember exactly what parts I used, but I did use some things in different stories.

18:53.752 --> 18:55.394
But most of it I just threw out.

18:56.115 --> 18:56.876
I didn't keep it.

18:56.896 --> 18:58.638
Too bad.

18:58.658 --> 18:59.519
No, it was real.

18:59.779 --> 19:01.601
You know, I'm not joking.

19:01.721 --> 19:11.432
It was very imitative, and as I said, I still don't know what it was imitative of, but it was so...

19:11.716 --> 19:16.202
It was like I'd lost my ear, my voice, as well as my brain.

19:18.445 --> 19:18.905
Now, what is it?

19:19.566 --> 19:23.271
Is there a problem for you in writing a novel?

19:23.491 --> 19:26.795
Or are you just so comfortable with the story form?

19:26.815 --> 19:36.387
Well, since I've been writing poems for such a long time, I was sort of used to coming to the end of something in my own lifetime, you know?

19:37.629 --> 19:40.052
So when I began to write stories, I was...

19:40.572 --> 19:43.076
coming, I was finishing them, you know.

19:43.536 --> 19:52.309
Even though some of them took me a year, I mean, it was not that I was finishing them fast, but I could anticipate finishing them.

19:52.329 --> 20:07.592
And so I think I, and then once I had the success of, not the worldly success, but the personal success of actually finishing two stories, I really liked performing right away a lot.

20:07.775 --> 20:10.878
I just had my shoes up tight suddenly.

20:11.519 --> 20:17.825
Are you surprised at all by the response that people have to your stories?

20:17.845 --> 20:19.807
Do you write for other people?

20:19.828 --> 20:23.331
Do you write fundamentally for yourself?

20:23.351 --> 20:24.633
I write, I think, for myself.

20:24.753 --> 20:27.796
I mean, I write from whatever is really distressing me.

20:27.856 --> 20:31.179
Every now and then, I'll write something for somebody.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.685
Or because something they've done...

20:37.795 --> 20:39.898
sort of inspired me, so to speak.

20:40.218 --> 20:53.674
I mean, I have a story called, um, um, well, I don't know, Toy Inventor, and I really wrote it for this guy, you know, but that's, uh, because that's the way he was.

20:54.856 --> 20:57.199
I noticed a change.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.202
I mean, your collections are very neatly.

21:00.222 --> 21:05.529
You had one in 59, and then there was one in 74, I guess, and then 85.

21:05.749 --> 21:07.011
Yeah, right.

21:07.031 --> 21:07.431
And, uh,

21:08.187 --> 21:14.655
do they reflect for you changes in American life or your life?

21:14.675 --> 21:36.422
Well, in my life, I mean, I think in the last one, I've begun, when I, in the first book, I'm really sticking very close to home, you know, and I think by the third book, I've traveled a little bit, you know, and I've gone to China, and I have a couple of stories about China, related to China.

21:36.993 --> 21:52.867
And I've been in different places, you know, and I've been politically much more active than I was in the 50s, although I was sort of a typical political, lesbian type kid, you know.

21:53.088 --> 21:56.014
And in the 50s, I was very involved in...

21:56.872 --> 22:12.349
You know, in education, and things around education, I remember this, because I was eating lunch, supper with some people last night, and I remember that

22:12.700 --> 22:22.570
They first knew me when I was sitting down at an air raid drill stand in the school system, which was in the 50s.

22:22.590 --> 22:24.272
So I must have been doing something then.

22:24.593 --> 22:29.358
I forgot that I was doing something, but I must have been.

22:29.378 --> 22:35.584
And I was, you know, I was in the PTA, and that was my best organization.

22:36.345 --> 22:36.905
I loved it.

22:37.126 --> 22:38.387
Now, you've been very...

22:38.992 --> 22:46.442
active politically, and I assume that you've gotten angry at things.

22:47.784 --> 22:51.009
Does that anger ever find its way?

22:52.150 --> 22:56.256
Well, I write, I mean, the business about women I wrote because I was so angry, but I didn't.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.681
They don't read like angry stories.

22:59.701 --> 23:00.021
No, no.

23:00.001 --> 23:04.709
The voices are real, and the language is wonderful humor.

23:05.451 --> 23:07.434
Humor you can't help if you've got it.

23:10.119 --> 23:11.381
It's interesting what you said.

23:11.441 --> 23:12.584
I'll give you an example.

23:12.644 --> 23:24.625
I was in Germany last year, and with me was called The Face of America, so they had a black, white, a tan, and a woman.

23:25.634 --> 23:29.458
an old woman, a young woman, and a Native American woman.

23:29.478 --> 23:41.951
And this Native American woman told the story of the Cherokee Trail of Tears, you know, from the point of view of somebody there.

23:42.852 --> 23:49.039
She told it very straight, and a man got up in a fury and was saying, why aren't you more angry?

23:51.561 --> 23:54.004
She said, but I told you the story and you're angry.

23:54.558 --> 24:00.004
And therefore you've succeeded at the job.

24:00.044 --> 24:02.327
Yeah, that's what I think you're supposed to do.

24:02.347 --> 24:11.178
You're supposed to, not to me, I mean, you do in a way or in a poem or something.

24:11.518 --> 24:14.441
You're not supposed to prove to the world how angry you are.

24:14.461 --> 24:20.649
You're supposed to allow people to get angry, worried, or upset.

24:20.689 --> 24:23.552
You're out of the picture already.

24:23.633 --> 24:29.727
Now you've said in other interviews that Bates is not yourself, per se.

24:30.028 --> 24:30.268
Yeah.

24:30.950 --> 24:35.741
But of course there are resonances, I guess.

24:36.001 --> 24:37.064
Sure.

24:37.164 --> 24:42.857
I've allowed her to have one or two of my experiences.

24:42.989 --> 24:46.555
But how do you decide when it's going to be a faith story?

24:48.257 --> 24:54.326
I sometimes am totally undecided, and it's only later that I decide it may as well be a faith story.

24:56.209 --> 24:57.652
And some of them I'm not sure.

24:58.553 --> 25:00.396
Do you have these voices?

25:00.416 --> 25:00.636
Yeah.

25:01.638 --> 25:02.359
Yeah.

25:02.379 --> 25:08.929
I mean, mostly the first person or even faith or...

25:09.415 --> 25:15.083
Well, they're not great stories if it's an interest in life as an Irish woman or something like that, or a black woman.

25:15.544 --> 25:16.445
Obviously not.

25:17.486 --> 25:18.648
Or an old woman, you know.

25:20.891 --> 25:28.482
Did you sense at all that, I think I started with the question, that you were a pioneer, that you were pioneering in form?

25:28.762 --> 25:33.409
No, you don't, I didn't think I was a pioneer because I didn't know the women's movement was coming.

25:34.831 --> 25:36.553
I mean, you know, I mean, I, uh,

25:36.685 --> 25:38.687
They're certainly out front.

25:39.428 --> 25:58.772
Yeah, but my feeling was that I was really, no, I mean, my feeling now is that we were, what was happening in the 50s was, in late 50s, early 60s, we were just accumulating drops that would make a way, you know, but we didn't know there were drops in anything.

25:59.193 --> 26:00.434
I mean, I didn't.

26:00.494 --> 26:04.279
Many people, I knew by the end of my first book,

26:04.546 --> 26:09.345
I knew I was a feminist, but I didn't know I was a feminist when I started.

26:10.109 --> 26:10.711
Really?

26:10.731 --> 26:11.213
Yeah.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.442
I was a socialist kid.

26:14.384 --> 26:19.511
At what point did you realize, I mean, I don't even know if that phrase had any concerns.

26:19.792 --> 26:22.015
No, no, you wouldn't say that even.

26:22.035 --> 26:24.338
You wouldn't say you were offended.

26:24.358 --> 26:29.505
And I'm sure it would have been treated, you know, as a subversive kind of thing.

26:29.545 --> 26:41.742
Well, no, we were thinking, I did this reading last night at the Manhattan Theater Club, and a lot of, not just old friends my age, a few of them were there, because I live in Vermont now, I don't see people so much.

26:42.228 --> 26:59.193
But also there were a lot of young women, or no longer that young, that I had worked with at the end of the 70s and early 80s in some women's things, the Women's Pentagon Action, and the first eco-feminist conference I think that was ever held in 79.

27:00.635 --> 27:03.739
And we were talking about that.

27:03.979 --> 27:11.290
I mean, when you know what you are, and...

27:11.557 --> 27:15.546
And the different, the struggles we had with the organizations we were in.

27:15.566 --> 27:19.475
I mean, like the Love of War Resisters League.

27:19.495 --> 27:22.562
To me, they're this secular pacifist organization.

27:22.603 --> 27:24.367
They're the only ones.

27:24.387 --> 27:25.870
All the others are religious.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.743
They're secular, so I've always liked them a lot.

27:29.823 --> 27:35.950
But when we began to organize women, everybody there was very offended.

27:36.090 --> 27:37.211
They were feeling for her.

27:37.752 --> 27:43.297
So it was a struggle to show people that that was okay.

27:43.357 --> 27:49.824
Not only was that good, but it brought women who would never pay any attention to that stuff.

27:49.844 --> 27:54.709
I suppose as a writer of fiction, you have to really guard against allowing...

27:54.959 --> 27:58.665
your writing to become politicized in any way.

27:58.685 --> 28:09.221
Well, you do, but you have to also, I mean, I think most American, a lot of American writers censor themselves.

28:09.502 --> 28:10.583
They're so afraid of it.

28:11.024 --> 28:17.975
I mean, if you were a Latin American writer or a text, you know, you wouldn't think twice about being political.

28:18.035 --> 28:18.736
I mean, you know.

28:19.237 --> 28:19.397
I don't.

28:19.900 --> 28:35.134
My feeling, though, is when you get somebody like Wright or Bertrand Russell or Solzhenitsyn, when the politics starts to take over the fiction, it feels very boring, don't you think?

28:35.454 --> 28:36.575
Yeah, but that's different.

28:36.595 --> 28:40.158
That's just bad writing at that point.

28:40.478 --> 28:47.865
I mean, that's where Solzhenitsyn has to go into all the, you know,

28:48.554 --> 29:01.709
I mean, you have to let your characters live.

29:03.612 --> 29:11.381
I think the point is, in American life, people try not to be political.

29:11.401 --> 29:14.925
I mean, I think that's what happens.

29:14.965 --> 29:18.409
They censor it out.

29:18.676 --> 29:30.795
I would rather, on the political side, just out of sheer pissiness.

29:30.815 --> 29:32.698
What was the word again?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.781
Pissiness.

29:35.422 --> 29:40.250
Otherwise I'll spend a half an hour trying to get that word.

29:42.854 --> 29:46.860
I would rather do it for that reason.

29:47.347 --> 29:52.233
You know, I've always said, you know, I mean, who's in charge of, you know, who's the boss in charge of beauty?

29:53.074 --> 29:55.537
You know, we don't know until later.

29:57.599 --> 29:58.340
Who do you read?

29:58.540 --> 30:03.426
I read anybody that I usually get their book.

30:03.727 --> 30:16.442
No, but I've read, I've been reading, well, I just read a book that's going to come out, Howard Roman's book called The Bird Artist, which,

30:16.675 --> 30:24.390
It's a beautiful little daughter, and I just finished the English Patient, and I just, before that I read, what did I read?

30:25.011 --> 30:28.178
Ceremony by Leslie Sokol.

30:28.318 --> 30:30.562
Oh, you must read the Native American writers.

30:30.582 --> 30:32.606
They're very, they're really terrific.

30:33.247 --> 30:39.139
I mean, we were in great times, except for the people that are being killed all over the world.

30:39.929 --> 30:47.680
But I mean, we live in times where all these different people are really speaking out, speaking up.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.742
It's really quite exciting.

30:49.762 --> 30:54.669
Do you think that the state of fiction, as you say, would increase?

30:54.789 --> 30:56.992
I think it's vigorous.

30:57.012 --> 30:58.675
And the younger ones coming along?

30:58.775 --> 31:00.838
Yeah, I mean, they're writing different.

31:00.858 --> 31:06.966
I mean, some of them are writing very naturalistically, but very few.

31:07.064 --> 31:12.624
Most of the Native American writers, like Leslie Silco, or I'm trying to think of a couple of other names.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.555
But they really, they, um...

31:16.210 --> 31:25.225
They've used every technique that's been developed, you know, that people have been using in terms of jumping around and, you know, standing on their heads.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.771
I mean, they're quite unafraid.

31:29.572 --> 31:30.694
How is your work?

31:30.714 --> 31:32.717
And Chicano writers, too.

31:32.898 --> 31:34.220
And you know what?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.383
They're getting a much wider readership.

31:37.145 --> 31:37.626
They are.

31:37.746 --> 31:39.368
And they're helping the readership.

31:39.469 --> 31:42.133
They're helping readers.

31:42.603 --> 31:45.128
people who might not need to become readers.

31:45.428 --> 31:50.858
All you have to do is go into a high school or something like that, as I've done, and try to work with kids.

31:51.058 --> 31:54.985
I was invited to this high school as a writer, right?

31:55.125 --> 31:58.051
So they were doing one of my stories, and they liked it.

31:58.111 --> 32:00.695
They said good things, and they learned from it.

32:00.715 --> 32:04.442
Then I read them one of Sandra Cisneros' stories.

32:05.300 --> 32:15.249
In 15 minutes, all these Spanish kids were writing stories about sitting on the stoop, you know, what happened, and the mother came, and the sister's boyfriend.

32:15.590 --> 32:20.594
They said, oh, you know, oh, that's how it's done.

32:22.076 --> 32:23.037
It's great.

32:23.417 --> 32:28.161
You enjoy working with young people, I guess, and helping them.

32:28.562 --> 32:29.402
I have enjoyed it.

32:31.044 --> 32:32.185
How do you...

32:32.637 --> 32:34.520
I mean, do you coach or do you teach?

32:34.820 --> 32:36.062
No, I don't coach.

32:36.082 --> 32:36.642
I don't edit.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.184
I mean, it's not even an editor.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.629
I mean, some people edit a lot.

32:42.150 --> 32:43.772
I mean, really great teachers.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.755
Like Donald Bartholomew is a great teacher.

32:46.275 --> 32:48.879
And he did a lot of, you know, like, is he bad?

32:49.379 --> 32:50.241
Is he bad?

32:50.261 --> 32:50.982
Is he bad?

32:51.002 --> 32:52.564
Is he bad?

32:52.584 --> 32:54.486
But he was a very, very fine teacher.

32:55.147 --> 33:00.875
But I just have people read aloud a lot.

33:02.176 --> 33:02.577
That's fine.

33:02.928 --> 33:06.952
talk to each other, and then I sit with them and look at the stories.

33:09.194 --> 33:11.236
I love the line, you have big luck and little luck.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.098
Yeah.

33:14.799 --> 33:16.500
Again, you pick up little phrases.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.082
One of your stories, I loved it.

33:18.242 --> 33:20.044
I had to write it down.

33:21.405 --> 33:24.387
I have no complaints worth troubling the management about it.

33:24.628 --> 33:32.715
It comes right off, you absolutely hear somebody in the streets of New York City coming out of the line like that.

33:32.999 --> 33:38.987
And I guess everything, you know, everything you've heard people say, more or less.

33:39.007 --> 33:40.308
Yeah, that's true.

33:40.349 --> 33:42.692
That's about a rapture story, right?

33:43.112 --> 33:43.753
Yeah, exactly.

33:43.873 --> 33:44.995
I love writing that.

33:45.015 --> 33:45.535
I like it.

33:45.555 --> 33:48.860
But, I mean, you must really hear these voices.

33:48.880 --> 33:56.369
I lived on 15th Street, right in the mouths of those people.

33:56.510 --> 33:57.451
So, that is very good.

33:57.611 --> 33:58.792
You're up in Vermont.

33:59.073 --> 34:02.297
I'm in New York.

34:02.817 --> 34:03.798
wonderful city.

34:04.719 --> 34:08.884
I just gave a lecture in New York last week at the public library.

34:09.024 --> 34:11.968
I always have a chance to... Oh, that's great.

34:12.348 --> 34:14.491
I gave one of the four-time lectures.

34:14.511 --> 34:14.851
Really?

34:16.293 --> 34:17.995
On what?

34:18.115 --> 34:18.796
My old book.

34:19.077 --> 34:20.739
Oh, yeah?

34:20.759 --> 34:23.622
Where do you get your inspiration for stories?

34:23.702 --> 34:24.924
I mean, I guess it's with you.

34:25.004 --> 34:26.065
Oh, yeah.

34:26.085 --> 34:26.546
Yeah.

34:28.127 --> 34:32.773
No, it's... I mean, suddenly you understand there's a story someplace in it, but...

34:33.496 --> 34:38.261
So then I might start writing it, but then I'm usually stuck a lot.

34:39.943 --> 34:42.726
Do you really labor over every word?

34:43.006 --> 34:46.450
I can't say I labor over it, but I read aloud.

34:46.630 --> 34:49.474
I like to read aloud, and I hear when things are wrong.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.735
So that's the poet.

34:51.015 --> 34:59.825
Yeah, so I hear it, and it's probably easier for me to know I've been wrong than somebody who just reads.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.608
You know, your eyes are very speedy.

35:02.926 --> 35:06.631
You had a blog in poetry a couple of years ago, I think.

35:06.651 --> 35:07.172
I do, yeah.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.894
That must have been a nice feeling, huh?

35:08.914 --> 35:10.877
I loved it, yeah.

35:10.937 --> 35:15.684
Sometimes I read, in certain places they ask me to just read poems.

35:15.704 --> 35:16.805
And I like that.

35:17.586 --> 35:19.329
I like to do that.

35:19.349 --> 35:20.931
I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

35:21.351 --> 35:25.457
The stories really absolutely do speak for themselves.

35:25.777 --> 35:32.747
I just wonder, do you see an evolution in your own progress as a writer?

35:33.301 --> 35:36.345
I love having a collection like this where they really do span.

35:36.785 --> 35:37.326
Yeah.

35:37.406 --> 35:39.348
I'm sort of scared to look at it even now.

35:39.368 --> 35:39.849
Are you really?

35:40.389 --> 35:48.959
Well, I'm just, I'm sort of scared to get too much of an idea of what I'm about, you know what I mean?

35:48.979 --> 35:54.025
I don't know why, but I don't know that I want to.

35:55.246 --> 35:57.209
I was scared to put it together.

35:57.309 --> 36:02.835
I mean, I thought, you know, what's that saying, period, you know?

36:03.355 --> 36:19.074
But that was both insolent, and I'm glad I did it now, because it's really, it's made me feel more open in a way, which surprises me, to what comes next.

36:20.396 --> 36:22.578
Were you tempted to tinker with any of the stories?

36:23.419 --> 36:24.721
No, that I tried not to do.

36:24.881 --> 36:31.489
Just maybe two or three places I changed the line, because I'd been reading the story a lot, and I noticed...

36:31.823 --> 36:34.526
that I stumbled on those lines.

36:35.507 --> 36:43.736
If you stumble on a line and you read the story about half a dozen times even, you made a mistake.

36:43.756 --> 36:44.577
Something's wrong.

36:44.657 --> 36:47.239
So those are the only places.

36:47.279 --> 36:50.443
I didn't think it was right to change an idea.

36:50.963 --> 36:54.627
Especially something that represented you in the 1950s.

36:54.687 --> 36:55.268
That's right.

36:55.388 --> 36:56.029
Why should I?

36:56.589 --> 36:59.012
Because I was mad at all the people who changed things.

36:59.498 --> 37:03.824
I was especially mad at Auden for changing whole poems that I had memorized.

37:06.908 --> 37:07.329
That's funny.

37:08.490 --> 37:13.057
Well, Henry James, when he brought out the New York edition, he wouldn't have any changed.

37:13.097 --> 37:17.483
He was writing the prefaces, and he was looking at the things.

37:17.723 --> 37:21.068
I mean, completed work should be completed work, don't you think?

37:21.088 --> 37:24.713
Yeah, no, I mean, I have certain essays I did that,

37:25.503 --> 37:30.550
I wish I had done a little better, so I might change those if they ever come out.

37:30.570 --> 37:34.676
But I know I did the best I could with these stories.

37:35.137 --> 37:43.288
I don't have the confidence that they're all great or anything like that, but I know that every one of them, I did the best.

37:43.388 --> 37:47.354
And then I therefore feel like I'd be a jerk.

37:47.915 --> 37:51.780
I'd be silly to change it, not because

37:52.317 --> 38:00.392
I would spoil it, but because it would really be a kind of betrayal to my own past.

38:01.414 --> 38:02.275
Something like that.

38:02.776 --> 38:03.598
That's a nice quote.

38:05.381 --> 38:06.884
I think I get plenty of material.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.168
Would you inscribe these?

38:11.112 --> 38:13.937
Sure I would.

38:14.356 --> 38:17.404
It's in such good shape, I'm scared of writing it.

38:17.464 --> 38:18.567
That's okay.

38:18.587 --> 38:21.676
Where do you want me to write?

38:21.696 --> 38:22.578
Where do you want me to do this?

38:22.598 --> 38:22.859
Here?

38:22.959 --> 38:26.870
Yeah, you can just sign this one and maybe inscribe this one.

38:26.890 --> 38:27.913
I should just sign it?

38:27.933 --> 38:29.236
Yeah, maybe that's okay.

38:29.256 --> 38:29.918
All right.

38:31.433 --> 38:34.841
Should I say the date or anything?

38:34.921 --> 38:36.164
No, just leave it like that.

38:36.786 --> 38:37.908
Oh, that's more pristine.

38:37.969 --> 38:41.617
And then you can write anything you'd like.

38:41.677 --> 38:42.760
That's great.

38:43.742 --> 38:44.223
May I?

38:44.624 --> 38:45.466
Yeah.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.451
That's okay.
