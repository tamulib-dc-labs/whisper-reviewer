WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:07.519
This is kind of a departure for you.

00:07.539 --> 00:11.467
We're talking with Gary Paulson here, this book, from what you've done previously.

00:11.507 --> 00:15.535
Tell me a little bit about that, if you would.

00:16.316 --> 00:18.340
Wait, you mean writing about the idea to write?

00:18.861 --> 00:18.961
Yeah.

00:19.783 --> 00:25.414
I ran it twice, and I wrote a book for children about it.

00:30.271 --> 00:32.674
the whole thing cook for a while before I wrote about it.

00:32.874 --> 00:39.823
It has such a devastating altering effect on your life.

00:40.303 --> 00:41.645
It's permanent.

00:41.665 --> 00:50.055
And I wanted to be able to evaluate a lot of that before I wrote about it, not kind of go crazy, but back off a little so I could see it.

00:51.037 --> 00:52.178
So I waited a few years.

00:53.035 --> 00:57.180
And of course, this is not a young adult book by any measure.

00:57.601 --> 01:00.485
No, it's written for adults.

01:00.685 --> 01:05.251
I started doing several adult works for Harcourt.

01:07.113 --> 01:21.372
I've been doing a lot of young adult stuff, and I started hitting walls, strange walls, where I would want to write about something, and it would be too adult or too complex, perhaps, or too...

01:22.178 --> 01:24.600
intricate maybe for young people.

01:24.921 --> 01:27.363
And I would find out I have to back off a little.

01:28.024 --> 01:30.666
So I decided then that I would do some work for adults.

01:30.686 --> 01:49.204
Let's probe that for a while because now where you have written about the Iditarod for younger readers and now you're writing about it for the wider audience, what exactly, tell me about where you hit the wall, say, in the earlier treatment of this subject and how you were able to expand it for, you know, in this one.

01:49.664 --> 01:50.785
When you write...

01:56.401 --> 01:59.128
The depth, that's P?

01:59.148 --> 02:03.899
Yeah, the sustaining difficulties of it.

02:05.443 --> 02:06.265
What was that word again?

02:06.726 --> 02:07.769
Sustaining difficulties.

02:07.789 --> 02:09.072
Okay.

02:09.132 --> 02:10.315
Sustaining, right?

02:10.335 --> 02:14.545
Yeah, but when you write about that in

02:22.422 --> 02:33.459
In the book for young people about the Iditarod, I wrote about a wolf kill, which I've seen several times, where they kill a deer.

02:33.719 --> 02:42.733
And I've actually taken quite a bit of flack from that by all sort of conservative school boards and different people who say that it's too violent.

02:42.753 --> 02:47.661
But it isn't necessarily violent, nearly as violent as the act.

02:48.742 --> 02:50.505
And I wanted people to understand that wolves,

02:51.397 --> 02:52.118
live that way.

02:52.178 --> 02:54.101
And to some measure, dogs do too.

02:54.521 --> 02:56.885
Dogs express a great deal of their life in violence.

02:57.706 --> 03:01.351
They fight and they kill things and eat it if they can.

03:02.473 --> 03:10.584
If I'm writing for adults, then I can go into those areas in more depth and talk about them.

03:11.004 --> 03:12.467
Now, you mentioned the experience.

03:12.487 --> 03:17.734
Was this book as much for you as it is for your readers?

03:17.854 --> 03:18.395
I think so.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.678
Winter Dance, in some measure, was a

03:21.350 --> 03:27.999
was a release for me in the sense that I miss the dogs terribly.

03:28.019 --> 03:29.882
Jesus, I miss the whole thing.

03:29.902 --> 03:31.023
No, they're gone, right?

03:31.043 --> 03:31.764
You sold them.

03:31.864 --> 03:33.747
My heart went and I had to get rid of them.

03:33.827 --> 03:35.349
How many did you have, by the way?

03:35.429 --> 03:37.793
At the height, I think we had 90, 91 dogs.

03:38.754 --> 03:43.961
And when my heart went bad, I think we were down to about 58 or 59, somewhere.

03:43.981 --> 03:49.669
But as a telling point in this, about six weeks ago, seven weeks ago,

03:49.936 --> 03:53.321
I went up to the Upper Peninsula, Michigan, and ran.

03:53.422 --> 03:54.203
I did around teens.

03:54.864 --> 03:55.144
Really?

03:55.345 --> 03:57.147
Yeah, just still kind of looking at it, you know.

03:57.228 --> 03:57.849
And how'd it feel?

03:58.169 --> 03:59.391
It was great.

03:59.692 --> 04:00.493
I didn't have any trouble.

04:01.294 --> 04:03.297
I ran for three days off and on.

04:04.379 --> 04:06.022
Not for the record, you mentioned heart troubles.

04:06.362 --> 04:09.347
I was in the Boston airport today.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.549
I found out about my heart.

04:10.569 --> 04:11.190
Oh, wonderful.

04:11.490 --> 04:11.771
Yeah.

04:12.592 --> 04:14.475
You know, you hear about East Coast people being...

04:21.560 --> 04:26.967
No, I just had a severe pain, and it stopped me dead, actually.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.531
It wasn't a heart attack, but it was angina.

04:30.813 --> 04:36.140
By the time I got back to, or angina, as the doctor corrected me.

04:37.041 --> 04:41.887
By the time I got back to Minnesota, I knew I was in some kind of trouble, so I went to the hospital and did the test.

04:42.048 --> 04:46.033
So you didn't do it, so the Boston thing didn't, you didn't stay here or anything?

04:46.193 --> 04:47.155
No, no, I wasn't.

04:47.215 --> 04:50.419
I was getting on the plane to go home when it happened.

04:50.585 --> 04:59.114
And I think what happened was the last pork chop or the last butter pad or something put that little plug in there, and that was enough to give it.

04:59.134 --> 05:01.136
Well, you cut it at the right time, that's for sure.

05:01.156 --> 05:01.677
I was really lucky.

05:01.777 --> 05:04.039
I got a warning.

05:04.059 --> 05:05.581
You know, a lot of people don't get that warning.

05:07.142 --> 05:09.665
And, of course, now you're living in a ranch down there, right?

05:09.685 --> 05:14.550
I'm in the warm southwest, a beautiful country with clear skies.

05:23.845 --> 05:27.769
This way she has a lot more light during the day.

05:28.069 --> 05:29.810
She's here to deal with things.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.812
Harcourt did very well by you.

05:31.852 --> 05:33.854
I thought the color photographs, for instance.

05:34.214 --> 05:35.355
That was a nice touch.

05:35.395 --> 05:37.157
They didn't have to do that.

05:37.517 --> 05:38.538
I took those slides.

05:38.819 --> 05:42.902
On my first run, I took about 700 slides going across.

05:42.962 --> 05:44.163
Most of them were no good.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.846
I was being dragged to my face or going off cliffs.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.490
But those in the book are slides that I actually took during the day.

05:52.195 --> 05:55.060
Again, let's go back to the writing of the book.

05:57.784 --> 06:02.692
As we said, you did this as much for yourself as you did for the readers.

06:04.716 --> 06:07.861
What exactly do you discover about yourself in something like this?

06:08.362 --> 06:10.565
Is this something as much for self-esteem?

06:10.585 --> 06:13.771
I don't think it's esteem so much as surprise.

06:13.971 --> 06:16.515
I never thought...

06:17.980 --> 06:27.809
You know, I've been around a while and done the Army and some things, and I never thought of myself as being endurable or enduring, right?

06:28.389 --> 06:35.996
I just never did, and I was really surprised when I finished the first race because it does take a really sustained effort.

06:36.096 --> 06:36.977
I mean, it really does.

06:37.037 --> 06:41.741
It's a long-term, you know, a 17-day gruel.

06:42.061 --> 06:46.705
Marathon runners talk about hitting walls, and they're talking about

06:49.891 --> 06:53.135
Well, you hit a wall every four or five hours.

06:53.196 --> 06:57.201
I mean, it's something that you really have to get through.

06:57.401 --> 07:00.305
And I was surprised at myself for being able to do it.

07:01.167 --> 07:01.767
I really was.

07:01.847 --> 07:09.378
And then to go back to actually run it twice was even more surprising.

07:09.458 --> 07:14.945
And to think that I was going to keep doing this and would still be doing it if my heart hadn't gone on me.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.490
I never thought I was that kind of a person.

07:18.691 --> 07:19.712
I just never did.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.752
really surprising.

07:25.812 --> 07:33.164
The other thing that was surprising was that it made me realize that quality of life is everything.

07:34.166 --> 07:38.954
That if you live unhappily, you might as well not live.

07:39.716 --> 07:46.307
That there are ways to live where beauty is everything, sort of.

07:47.587 --> 07:54.396
Was there ever – I mean, you mentioned – you made the comparison between this and running a marathon.

07:55.617 --> 08:00.904
And, of course, this might just work up here because the Boston Marathon is coming up.

08:01.965 --> 08:09.635
The thousands of people who participate in that, you know, only a handful ever expect to emerge victorious, to win.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.039
For them, the experience is to run it and to finish it.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.402
Is there a parallel there in this?

08:15.422 --> 08:16.644
Very, very much so.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.425
I never –

08:18.282 --> 08:24.768
In my first race, number one, I was voted least likely to get out of Anchorage by the other people in the race.

08:25.128 --> 08:27.651
And it was a valid opinion.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.634
I mean, I was lucky to get out of Anchorage.

08:30.654 --> 08:34.237
And I never fought in terms of competition.

08:35.038 --> 08:36.199
By the second race, I did.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.562
By the second race, I was thinking in terms of winning.

08:39.582 --> 08:39.922
Really?

08:40.103 --> 08:41.404
Yeah, and I should have won.

08:41.764 --> 08:42.965
I had the best team in the race.

08:42.985 --> 08:44.327
I honest to God did.

08:44.347 --> 08:45.808
I had an astonishing dog team.

08:46.447 --> 08:50.252
I easily pass Susan Butcher, Rick Swinton, any of those people.

08:51.553 --> 08:58.923
How much is it, how much, well, you mentioned the dogs, but I mean now, how much is the dogs and how much is the driver?

08:59.343 --> 09:02.627
It's about 95% dogs and 5% driver.

09:02.708 --> 09:11.779
In my case, I was the 5% was my error in judgment that caused me to lose the race.

09:11.995 --> 09:13.437
To not, in fact, not finish.

09:13.457 --> 09:14.798
I scratched 80 miles from those.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.159
So you'd never blame the dogs?

09:16.179 --> 09:16.660
No, no.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.503
They were absolutely magnificent.

09:20.484 --> 09:21.325
Never had any trouble.

09:21.405 --> 09:23.347
I mean, they were ready to go all the time.

09:23.507 --> 09:24.448
So what was your error?

09:25.009 --> 09:29.533
I got out on the sea ice at the wrong time and crossing Norton Sound.

09:30.114 --> 09:32.597
And you got to cross 75 miles of ice, and I should have waited.

09:32.997 --> 09:33.538
I should have waited.

09:34.859 --> 09:37.682
Well, what was there there that you could have seen that you didn't?

09:37.882 --> 09:43.348
Other people had tried and had not been able to do it, had been blown back.

09:43.408 --> 09:46.692
And I thought, well, Libby got out there.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.775
Libby Riddell's the first woman who won, and she made it.

09:49.035 --> 09:52.079
And I kept thinking I could do it, and I just got blown back.

09:52.179 --> 09:53.881
I should have just waited.

09:54.381 --> 09:58.506
I was out there two and a half days, and I should have waited that time and just finished the race.

09:59.187 --> 10:03.552
Or I should have gone sooner, even 15 hours sooner would have.

10:04.409 --> 10:07.414
would have changed the structure of the race.

10:07.434 --> 10:07.854
I didn't.

10:07.915 --> 10:10.258
And this was my judgment call, which was a mistake.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.303
So you were really here a competitor?

10:13.824 --> 10:14.445
I was, yeah.

10:14.846 --> 10:26.705
In fact, that team, with my handler running, who was a rookie the next year, he ran a race in Minnesota, 500 miler, called the Bear Race, which some people say is at least as hard as the Editarod.

10:27.466 --> 10:28.027
It's grueling.

10:28.447 --> 10:30.771
But anyway, all the Alaskan teams came down.

10:30.970 --> 10:34.498
Susan Butcher, Rick Swenson, everybody came down there were going to sweep the race.

10:35.079 --> 10:39.488
And my handler won the race, the first race he ever ran with my team.

10:39.669 --> 10:40.170
He beat them all.

10:40.691 --> 10:41.593
That's exciting, isn't it?

10:41.613 --> 10:44.138
It was like winning the Super Bowl the first time he picked up a football.

10:44.319 --> 10:44.980
Yeah.

10:45.483 --> 11:06.613
um tell me about the iditarod uh you know in in any sense i mean it is a rather extraordinary event isn't it i mean it tests it tests everything i had an older man who was a native american who ran dogs in fact he might be the best tell me that he thought the iditarod was

11:12.078 --> 11:12.418
Great.

11:12.498 --> 11:14.180
Let's see if I can get that in any of my papers.

11:14.201 --> 11:15.382
You know what I mean.

11:15.802 --> 11:17.705
But there's some validity to that.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.789
There's a shock that occurs to your system.

11:22.330 --> 11:35.265
And it becomes so extreme so soon that you're in this sort of shock for about the first, oh, third of the race, just trying to adapt to things as they come at you.

11:35.285 --> 11:39.250
And I think even after you've run it once, that hits the second race and the fifth race.

11:39.652 --> 11:42.535
I mean, I sponsored a guy this year for his second race.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.958
He ran last year and came in last.

11:44.978 --> 11:45.619
He was a friend of mine.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.581
It was his dogs I ran when I went up to Michigan.

11:48.222 --> 11:52.287
I sponsored him again this year, and he busted his leg, tore it all to hell.

11:52.668 --> 11:56.252
I mean, you know, he was thinking in terms of competition.

11:56.332 --> 12:00.657
He was thinking, you know, he's going to go up there and maybe do all right, maybe be in the money.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.140
He's got a really awful fracture.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.245
He's got to have pins and silver screws and stuff put in, you know.

12:08.963 --> 12:12.968
I guess I'm searching for, is the idea to write a metaphor for anything?

12:16.693 --> 12:17.174
Combat.

12:17.594 --> 12:19.557
No, I don't know that it is.

12:19.697 --> 12:28.909
I think once you've run it, once you've run it, it alters the way you view everything after that.

12:28.989 --> 12:33.975
So it's real easy to say that, okay, it's a metaphor for life or it's a metaphor for life.

12:45.346 --> 12:51.232
But I think a lot of that is flavored by once you've run it, it changes the way you view things.

12:51.253 --> 12:54.656
I don't think anything's hard anymore, you know, compared to that.

12:54.856 --> 12:57.860
I mean, this last summer, I'll give you an example.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.584
People have been talking about Harleys, you know, Harley-Davidson this and Harley.

13:02.044 --> 13:04.027
I thought, well, Christ, it can't be that much.

13:04.047 --> 13:04.928
So I went and bought one.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.450
And I rode it around here for a while.

13:08.431 --> 13:13.497
And I thought, well, what can you do with a Harley that would be the maximum expression to see what the hell they're all about?

13:14.101 --> 13:16.905
So I took off from here and went up to Alaska and back.

13:16.925 --> 13:17.727
I went up the Alcan.

13:18.247 --> 13:18.668
No kidding.

13:18.788 --> 13:19.630
Yeah, it took three weeks.

13:19.850 --> 13:23.816
And I got back and people said, God, you know, you went up the Alcan.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.302
But to me it was not much, frankly.

13:28.003 --> 13:29.665
You know, I busted my left foot doing it.

13:29.685 --> 13:35.575
I laid her over three times in construction zones and busted up my left big toe.

13:36.316 --> 13:41.003
But I never, it didn't seem like much of a thing to me.

13:41.978 --> 13:45.243
It wasn't anywhere near as hard as that race.

13:46.344 --> 13:51.392
I think in that sense that it's very difficult to draw metaphors.

13:51.412 --> 13:53.895
It's kind of like the Boston Marathon.

13:53.935 --> 13:55.938
I could not run the marathon.

13:55.978 --> 13:58.201
Probably even when I was healthy, I could not run it.

13:58.702 --> 13:59.824
I could trudge it.

14:01.066 --> 14:05.472
But I know that it's nothing compared to the Iditarod.

14:12.725 --> 14:15.448
running it with 80 and 90 mile an hour winds.

14:15.468 --> 14:20.895
And you aren't required to spend two weeks, sleep two weeks out in the wilderness.

14:20.935 --> 14:26.221
You aren't sitting on a sled wearing a sanitary napkin because your asshole's bleeding.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.885
So I had to, in both races, I used sanitary napkins.

14:29.905 --> 14:32.148
I mean, it's an enormous difference.

14:32.168 --> 14:35.632
People try to relate to, you know, marathons and that.

14:37.174 --> 14:40.538
But it's simply not, it doesn't really relate to other races.

14:41.159 --> 14:42.581
Areas of endeavor, I guess.

14:42.601 --> 14:43.463
So then why do it?

14:44.745 --> 14:45.226
Oh, God.

14:48.811 --> 14:49.793
You are proving something.

14:49.813 --> 14:51.055
It's like becoming a cave painting.

14:51.415 --> 14:51.816
Say again?

14:52.197 --> 14:54.541
It's like becoming a cave painting.

14:54.981 --> 14:58.327
You go back 10, 15,000 years.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.450
The dogs don't know.

15:01.797 --> 15:02.598
what year it is.

15:02.678 --> 15:09.648
The dogs don't know anything about high-tech stuff or that you've got Teflon runners on your sled or any of this stuff.

15:09.668 --> 15:11.351
The dogs are exactly like they were.

15:12.252 --> 15:17.319
They haven't changed in millions of years or hundreds of thousands of years.

15:18.321 --> 15:22.987
Sled dogs and dogs helping men work have been around many thousands of years.

15:23.929 --> 15:26.893
So when you start running them,

15:31.008 --> 15:33.211
kind of thinking, you go back to theirs.

15:34.152 --> 15:38.477
And you become extremely, I don't know, ancient in your mind.

15:38.558 --> 15:39.499
It's a wonderful feeling.

15:40.420 --> 15:48.170
They recently, or in the last few years, I think, found this body of this Ice Age man in the Alps between... Oh, that was a great story.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.812
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.832 --> 15:52.495
But I understand exactly what he was like.

15:53.737 --> 15:59.344
I mean, when they showed his little copper axe and his tools, his arrow shafts,

16:04.015 --> 16:05.398
to keep his feet warm.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.004
That's how I kept my feet warm.

16:09.187 --> 16:12.555
I put grass in the bottom of my mucklucks.

16:12.575 --> 16:16.023
And this is, well, what, 6,000 years between us, or eight?

16:16.264 --> 16:17.046
Well, because it works.

16:17.487 --> 16:18.168
Yeah, it does work.

16:18.248 --> 16:19.672
And it worked then, and it works now.

16:19.952 --> 16:22.378
There's a kind of beauty to that.

16:32.348 --> 16:36.814
And I would run that son of a bitch every year until I died.

16:37.235 --> 16:37.956
No kidding.

16:37.976 --> 16:38.596
I really would.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.781
But, of course, it's over.

16:41.861 --> 16:42.902
I mean, you don't expect to.

16:42.982 --> 16:43.263
It's over.

16:43.343 --> 16:43.703
I can't.

16:43.863 --> 16:49.671
I could perhaps run it with maybe if I had a bypass and did a bunch of shit, you know.

16:49.992 --> 16:52.775
But the doctor said the stress would kill you.

16:53.016 --> 16:55.759
And the doctor is a friend of mine.

16:55.779 --> 16:57.402
So, I mean, he's just trying to be accurate.

16:57.962 --> 17:01.427
And it isn't the physical drain so much as the mental activity.

17:02.116 --> 17:09.444
You know, I'm not looking for a cosmic thing here, but are you a better person for this?

17:09.764 --> 17:10.905
I think so.

17:10.925 --> 17:16.371
I know I am in the way I view work.

17:16.851 --> 17:22.597
I approach my life now as if it were Iditarod, end to end to end to end to end.

17:22.617 --> 17:31.887
My writing, Harley, you know, whatever it is, it allows me to focus.

17:32.542 --> 17:40.269
on things so that I can do the most with them or achieve the most with them.

17:40.449 --> 17:48.316
And I think that has happened to many people who have run the race, not just me.

17:49.377 --> 17:51.399
Of course, the book speaks for itself.

17:51.479 --> 17:56.263
It's not necessary for me to ask you about the things that you discuss in the book.

17:56.944 --> 18:00.827
What are you working on now, might I ask?

18:00.947 --> 18:02.008
I had done a.

18:11.472 --> 18:23.503
the trilogy and the working of the second book, which would be from my age of about 9 or 10 until I was 26, working in Hollywood.

18:23.523 --> 18:25.505
That's great.

18:25.525 --> 18:27.567
Well, listen, I won't take up too much of your time.

18:27.587 --> 18:29.629
I wanted to get some quotes here.

18:30.450 --> 18:34.273
I will be here until Friday night if you have any other questions.

18:34.293 --> 18:34.494
Okay.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.816
And then I leave on my killer tour.

18:37.276 --> 18:39.238
Have you been interviewed by anyone up in Alaska?

18:40.159 --> 18:40.399
No.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.783
Well, I'm going to try and pitch it up there.

18:44.063 --> 18:44.664
Well, good luck.

18:45.965 --> 18:46.526
We'll see.

18:46.806 --> 18:49.549
I just wish the bastards would return their phone calls.

18:49.569 --> 18:57.777
There's a kind of arrogance in Alaska against people in the lower 48.

18:57.877 --> 18:58.778
It's still there.

18:58.858 --> 18:59.659
And they're very nice.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.760
I mean, people are very nice.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.021
They were always very nice to me.

19:02.381 --> 19:04.744
I actually had one guy.

19:04.904 --> 19:11.010
I had trained my dogs to sleep on little foam pads, and I got them off the ice.

19:17.808 --> 19:24.298
You know, people will carry straw to do that, make straw beds for them, or have straw at the checkpoints, and I had these foam pads.

19:25.179 --> 19:28.264
So one of the other mushers came up to me and said, God, that's a hell of an idea.

19:28.284 --> 19:30.287
He says, it's too bad you're not from Alaska.

19:30.327 --> 19:33.873
People would like it if you were from Alaska.

19:33.893 --> 19:35.235
All right, great.

19:35.255 --> 19:36.137
Listen, I'm going to let you go.

19:36.177 --> 19:36.838
Okay.

19:37.098 --> 19:38.841
Good luck, and I look forward to talking to you next time.

19:39.001 --> 19:39.782
Yeah, we'll see you again.

19:39.862 --> 19:40.243
Take care.

19:40.443 --> 19:40.864
Nice talking to you.

19:41.044 --> 19:42.246
Nice talking to you, too.

19:43.255 --> 19:43.756
There we go.

19:44.276 --> 19:44.677
Okay.

19:44.697 --> 19:46.659
I love your book.

19:47.060 --> 19:47.680
Thank you very much.

19:48.922 --> 19:54.509
Explain to me why Marlowe, a 400-year-old mystery.

19:56.331 --> 19:57.933
What energized you here?

19:58.954 --> 20:02.939
Well, the fact that it is a mystery, one of those historical puzzles.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.567
If you are a historian, then I always find them irresistible.

20:09.901 --> 20:17.253
as a sort of punter, and this was what I felt that I could do something about and get my teeth into as an investigator.

20:18.816 --> 20:22.001
Plus, Marlow has always been something of a hero of mine.

20:22.161 --> 20:27.370
And let me also say that as an English major in college many years ago,

20:27.350 --> 20:32.959
I've always been one to actually favor Marlowe over Shakespeare.

20:33.480 --> 20:40.551
Well, yes, certainly in terms of some kind of free soul that comes out about the man himself.

20:40.571 --> 20:47.923
Yeah, well, I mean, even the plays, I think, to the age of 29, play for play, he was the superior playwright, I think.

20:47.943 --> 20:50.507
Yeah, well, that's certainly true, yes, exactly.

20:50.928 --> 20:51.248
Yeah.

20:51.228 --> 20:54.332
Shakespeare would probably go along with you, though.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.053
I think so.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.697
You know, they were both exactly the same age.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.079
Anyway, go ahead.

20:59.099 --> 21:04.026
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I share your enthusiasm for the man.

21:04.066 --> 21:05.408
Let's start with that.

21:05.428 --> 21:07.931
That's part of the answer, really, in that sense.

21:08.031 --> 21:10.194
The man himself has fascinated me.

21:10.935 --> 21:19.547
The period is one that has fascinated me, and the riddle, if you like, of his murder.

21:20.455 --> 21:23.499
What made you think that you could crack it after four centuries?

21:24.941 --> 21:27.164
Arrogance.

21:27.184 --> 21:29.047
I was just going to say arrogance.

21:29.067 --> 21:30.168
I didn't want to say it.

21:31.190 --> 21:44.488
Let me say that, first of all, historical investigation, having done a little bit of it on this and other books,

21:44.890 --> 21:54.566
It is extraordinary the extent to which you find, you go over things and see things that people haven't seen before, however well-trodden the path is.

21:55.587 --> 21:59.874
Not that the matter of Marlow's death had been very well-trodden, but obviously it had been investigated.

22:00.776 --> 22:01.697
So there is that.

22:01.798 --> 22:09.430
I think, you know, you call up the papers and you'll see things in the papers and so on that people haven't seen before.

22:09.983 --> 22:15.430
The second point I would make on that, in other words, that first point is basically saying, look for yourself.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.596
Don't necessarily believe what others tell you when they have looked.

22:19.636 --> 22:39.703
The second point I would say is that from the vantage point of, say, the mid-1980s, which is about when I started thinking about it, the whole understanding of the way the secret services worked, the intelligence services,

22:40.612 --> 22:54.083
our understanding of it by that point had really become rather more subtle or rather more well-informed, rather more extensive than it had been before.

22:54.764 --> 23:10.197
In other words, someone working in the 1920s, which was basically when the serious archival work on Marlowe, and particularly the matter of Marlowe's death, was being done by people like Hotson and Eccles and so on, Americans, I hasten to add, or

23:10.447 --> 23:12.790
Canadians and Americans.

23:13.531 --> 23:35.661
They did brilliant archival work, they did brilliant investigative work to some extent on the murder, but that whole context which I supply for it, the context of espionage and intelligence, I would say someone in the 1920s just didn't really have that kind of understanding of how these things

23:37.852 --> 23:39.154
as we do now.

23:39.695 --> 24:06.913
So there's a sort of historical trick of perspective, in a way, whereby someone writing, say, after the 1960s, in an English sort of rather parochial English perspective, I'm sort of thinking after the blunt Philby Burgess sort of revelations, you have equivalents over here, your Wilderness and Mirrors, your James, Jesus, Angles, or should that be Jesus?

24:07.585 --> 24:29.819
you know, that whole awareness we have of how the complex, labyrinthine world of the Secret Services works, I really applied that, I believe, sort of, you know, not imposing it, but I applied it correctly to the case.

24:30.399 --> 24:32.142
And, you know, perhaps someone

24:32.476 --> 24:37.944
at least a generation ago looking at the case wouldn't really have understood that aspect in the way that we can.

24:40.988 --> 24:51.884
Was there for you, to use a phrase from Watergate, the smoking pistol, was there a smoking pistol for you or was it really the body of evidence?

24:52.685 --> 24:56.070
The smoking pistol to some extent was the

24:56.303 --> 25:02.974
the nature of the three men who were left standing after 8 o'clock on the 30th.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.540
And I think you quite correctly begin your study with them, by the way.

25:06.560 --> 25:14.454
Yes, they were the ones that said to me, well, hell, if there isn't something fishy going on here, you know, where is there something fishy going on?

25:14.474 --> 25:21.265
I mean, obviously, at the back of one's mind throughout all of this is the possibility that despite all the sort of

25:22.257 --> 25:27.485
circumstances and everything else someone's uncovered, it still might have been an argument over the bill.

25:28.847 --> 25:43.227
But having said that, I guess the smoking gun for me was the record of the nature of those three men that he met up with and in whose company he died.

25:44.049 --> 25:47.033
They more than anything said to me,

25:47.772 --> 25:49.475
There's something fishy going on here.

25:50.276 --> 25:59.552
Any surprises for you as you – I mean, did you kind of go in with the notion that – I mean, there has been speculation, of course, that Marlowe was, in fact, killed.

25:59.633 --> 26:00.795
I mean, that's not new.

26:00.835 --> 26:03.900
No, I was kind of – it was the first.

26:04.281 --> 26:11.974
But what you try to do is nail this thing down and – but you obviously proceeded with that notion.

26:11.954 --> 26:18.601
Yes, I mean, I suppose, you know, those who would regard it as an insult will take it as such.

26:18.681 --> 26:24.246
I mean, I would describe myself as a conspiracy theorist on it.

26:24.266 --> 26:34.136
I think, you know, this was an age of conspiracy, so I think conspiracy theory is sort of to some extent legitimized by that context, although, of course, one has to nail it down.

26:35.918 --> 26:39.902
I guess what I'm saying is what you found more or less validated what you felt.

26:40.118 --> 26:42.349
as opposed to surprise you?

26:44.388 --> 26:45.830
Yes, I suppose that would be true.

26:45.870 --> 26:52.078
I mean, I suppose you could say I set out to... And there's nothing wrong with that.

26:52.098 --> 27:02.651
I mean, it's obviously... To uncover a sort of Secret Service type plot, and to some extent that's what I did, although I don't know if I have uncovered exactly what did happen.

27:02.671 --> 27:13.264
I don't really claim to have uncovered exactly what happened, merely to have illuminated the context of what it did, you know, and to lead us all up to that moment, even though one can't actually say what happened.

27:13.582 --> 27:18.873
for sure, or what exact agenda was happening at that moment.

27:19.434 --> 27:28.333
But yes, I certainly started off with the general idea that there was some kind of

27:29.140 --> 27:58.489
dirty trick and nothing I've discovered has deflected me from that within that I'd say that the particular man who I end up pointing the finger at is not the one that I started off believing without wishing to bog your readers down or leaving it up to you as to how much you bog them down in the detail you know the man Robert Pooley was intuitively once suspect because he was

27:58.908 --> 28:13.424
certainly the most sort of veteran intelligence or the veteran player in the secret game of those four men, including Marlow, who got up there.

28:13.965 --> 28:22.054
He was the senior, if you like, of the four men, if you want to look at them in terms of as intelligence agents.

28:22.895 --> 28:25.658
But he is not the one I end up

28:25.942 --> 28:28.527
pointing the finger at as the actual villain of the piece.

28:29.228 --> 28:41.031
In fact, the way it sort of seems to pan out from my findings is that he, if anyone, was to some extent there as a

28:42.310 --> 28:54.395
protector of Marlowe, as perhaps Marlowe's superior or Marlowe's particular contact within that particular grouping of four men.

28:54.856 --> 29:00.167
He is the one who is actually closest to Marlowe in terms of their allegiances

29:00.147 --> 29:01.829
and so on.

29:01.849 --> 29:05.394
How did you come to speculate on a motive, of course, if this were a trial?

29:05.454 --> 29:06.956
You know, we have to have motive.

29:09.439 --> 29:12.363
I'm not sure that one does is perhaps one answer to that.

29:12.403 --> 29:24.720
You know, this is the sort of world in which people act out of the most opportunistic and sort of unconsidered motives.

29:25.308 --> 29:40.887
they, to some extent, act and then put the reasons for their actions together afterwards, that certainly is something that emerges quite clearly from the sort of study of this world, of the intelligence world.

29:41.368 --> 29:53.222
There are a lot of cowboys floating around, feeding off each other, betraying each other when it's convenient to do so, and it's within that rather

29:53.978 --> 30:06.230
sort of unmotivated, but things happen which aren't motivated by any coherent political approach.

30:06.731 --> 30:09.017
So one wouldn't necessarily...

30:09.436 --> 30:32.760
One wouldn't necessarily find a totally coherent motive, but I believe one can find, and I believe I do find, the correct sort of context for it, which is this rivalry between Sir Walter Raleigh and the Earl of Essex, taking Marlow, as he was certainly believed to be, as a follower and friend of Raleigh's,

30:32.926 --> 30:46.159
and taking one of the men he meets up with in Deptford, Nicholas Skeers, as a secret servant of the Earl of Essex's, which he certainly was, of the evidence.

30:46.199 --> 31:01.515
This is one of the contributions I have made, I think, to really nail that particular connection between Skeers, who's there in the room in Deptford, and the Earl of Essex, and Essex's whole sort of intelligence

31:02.052 --> 31:04.836
network which he used at the time.

31:05.798 --> 31:27.452
So it's really sort of finding those contexts of allegiance, those contexts of former kind of commitment, who's belonging to who in that sort of Elizabethan sense, and finds really each of those four men have their connections and allegiances and it's really sort of taking it from there to work out

31:27.770 --> 31:33.401
which one has the motive and the sort of context for actually killing.

31:33.702 --> 31:46.748
You know, when you consider how little documentary information is available, say, on Shakespeare, you know, and we have Sean Bob's books on the documentary.

31:47.008 --> 31:47.449
That's right, yeah.

31:47.429 --> 31:47.749
life.

31:48.170 --> 31:55.059
And really, there's basically a positive information, although what you have is very useful.

31:55.780 --> 32:07.995
I guess what I'm saying is how surprised I am that you were able to learn as much as you did about those three men, I mean, who are otherwise anonymous Elizabethan men.

32:08.476 --> 32:10.679
Yes, absolutely, they are, yes.

32:10.899 --> 32:16.947
Well, with perhaps the exception of Pooley, who sits around and turns up in other contexts.

32:17.753 --> 32:21.018
particularly the Barrington plot of a few years previously.

32:21.038 --> 32:27.487
So people would perhaps have known a bit about him had he not been there the night that Marlow was killed.

32:27.527 --> 32:29.470
Certainly the other two were totally obscure.

32:29.811 --> 32:35.239
But you were actually able to get some insight into the characters.

32:35.699 --> 32:39.966
Yes, I mean, it's amazing how much there is, in a way.

32:40.246 --> 32:41.528
It's a question of finding it.

32:41.828 --> 32:43.251
It amazes me, I have to say.

32:43.271 --> 32:45.634
I mean, there is, you know, there is,

32:45.952 --> 32:56.069
You go to the public record office, it's the main sort of problem sort of confronting the investigator is not the paucity of documentation in general.

32:56.289 --> 32:57.671
But the significance, I guess.

32:57.692 --> 33:01.598
Yeah, finding the significant piece amid the sort of mass of

33:02.405 --> 33:06.049
and for one's own purpose is insignificant stuff.

33:06.089 --> 33:15.800
I always go back to that guy, I forget his name, but remember he desperately wanted to find something on Shakespeare when he found that Belotte-Montjoie deposition.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.264
Remember that thing when Shakespeare was living in Blackfriars, I guess?

33:19.844 --> 33:20.465
Yes.

33:20.825 --> 33:26.792
And he found that Shakespeare was deposed and would have brought it to a civil case.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.616
This, I think, would be Leslie Hodson as well.

33:29.636 --> 33:46.361
Yeah, I think it was, I forget who it was, I don't think it was Hodson, but it was some guy, I think it was a Canadian, though, and he was an otherwise anonymous guy, I mean, who really wanted to find something on Shakespeare and just started going through all the records over there and came up with this thing.

33:46.762 --> 33:50.788
Well, it sort of ties back to a little bit what I said earlier, you know, that

33:51.038 --> 33:57.827
if you go looking at yourself, you find there are bits, even where you think it's been very well trodden, for instance.

33:57.847 --> 34:02.273
It's extraordinary what little bits have been, or little avenues have been missed.

34:02.874 --> 34:15.811
And it's, I sort of think of it, it's like a sort of tuning into the galaxy, you know, this mass of white noise and static, and then suddenly you get this bleep of sort of some actual signal.

34:16.452 --> 34:18.615
You know, you've got to wade through a mass of

34:19.507 --> 34:22.410
Largely illegible and uninteresting.

34:22.510 --> 34:23.612
How long did you work on this?

34:25.173 --> 34:31.941
Actually, sort of top of my list of things and so on, three years.

34:32.141 --> 34:33.302
That's pretty fast.

34:33.903 --> 34:43.033
Previous to that, a lot of many years sort of generally sort of interested in the subject, three years specific research.

34:43.300 --> 34:55.494
Now, I have your book, A Couple of News, here, and I was just looking for it as we spoke, and of course, you know, when the place is loaded down, that period, again, is a favorite of mine.

34:55.674 --> 35:00.360
Did you more or less go into Marlowe from Nash, would you say?

35:00.840 --> 35:01.441
I did indeed.

35:01.461 --> 35:11.012
I would say it was researching on Nash that first really sort of got me interested in Marlowe, or in the case of Marlowe's death, I'd certainly been interested in Marlowe before,

35:10.992 --> 35:34.249
but interested in the particular matter of his death, because I reckoned that Nash, well, certainly must have known quite a little bit about it, being the sort of guy he was anyway, quite a part of the fact he was a friend of Barlow's, and sort of speculating, as I did, perhaps a little wider the mark, and perhaps looking back on it, as to

35:34.600 --> 35:40.388
what might or might not be discernible in Nash's pamphlets on the question of Marlowe's death.

35:40.728 --> 35:48.478
And I did a little bit of thinking about it while writing the Nash book, which was now sort of 10, 12 years ago I was writing it.

35:49.079 --> 35:53.304
Well, you mentioned Green, of course, but he shows up all over the place, doesn't he?

35:53.324 --> 35:55.607
Yes, I mean, it was a very small world.

35:55.767 --> 35:57.830
You know, that's one of the joys of it in a way.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.292
You get into this world,

35:59.542 --> 36:29.076
um you come back to it uh several years later to write a book about another writer but it's it's all the same you know they all knew each other they all lived down when you when you quoted the growth's worth of wit i thought for sure you'd mention the shakespeare thing reference in there yeah shakespeare's of course the one he was the yeah it is hard to pin down certainly this early stage of the 950 90s and he's doubtless in there but but the sort of intimacy of the scene is one of the things i love about it

36:29.630 --> 36:31.993
It's such a small world.

36:32.153 --> 36:37.621
It's such a sort of, in a way, it sort of seems almost rather amateurish.

36:37.641 --> 36:53.101
You know, it's just these young guys all knocking around together in the same sort of taverns and hanging out at the bookstores and sort of these rather showy sort of disreputable young men.

36:53.141 --> 36:56.886
And they're all, you know, the great sort of,

36:57.170 --> 37:02.650
now consider the great sort of foundations of English relations literature.

37:03.152 --> 37:08.732
I like the sort of you get that sort of you cross over from that rather

37:09.455 --> 37:16.205
Was it difficult for you to refrain from talking about the literary end of it?

37:16.426 --> 37:18.850
Not really, for that reason.

37:19.210 --> 37:23.096
I feel the literary end of it has been talked about so much.

37:24.078 --> 37:27.723
And that sort of idea that you break through that barrier.

37:27.743 --> 37:36.677
But I think sometimes you risk losing the more general kind of a reader who might not know who the hell Christopher Maui is.

37:36.657 --> 37:43.712
It's possible, although I think on the other hand, the general reader is not going to be very interested in a lot of comments about his plays either.

37:44.153 --> 37:54.174
I mean, certainly in England it has proved to be vindicated to some extent by the fact the book sold rather better than anyone expected.

37:54.234 --> 37:54.735
No kidding.

37:54.795 --> 37:57.501
That was because it was about

37:58.055 --> 38:07.395
a real drama sort of dodgy young man as opposed to about a famous English poet, you know.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.041
In your mind, did Marlowe have a fatal flaw?

38:11.604 --> 38:12.807
Oh, several.

38:14.525 --> 38:15.186
Which one?

38:15.807 --> 38:20.314
I mean, he was, well, I used the word dodgy just now.

38:21.596 --> 38:24.941
I don't know if that translates into American very well.

38:24.961 --> 38:25.081
Dodgy.

38:26.163 --> 38:29.007
Would you spell it so I can get it right away somewhere?

38:29.067 --> 38:30.189
D-O-D-G-Y.

38:30.409 --> 38:30.810
Okay.

38:31.251 --> 38:38.742
It means sort of shady and rather untrustful, yet also probably a bit charming, you know.

38:39.463 --> 38:40.385
Rogish, perhaps?

38:40.645 --> 38:43.249
Rogish, perhaps, yes, exactly.

38:44.360 --> 38:52.127
But one wonders what he did to bring about his own demise.

38:52.147 --> 38:53.187
Well, I think, yes.

38:53.288 --> 38:58.352
I mean, one can say he's a victim of court injury, as I say in the book, but he's certainly not an innocent victim.

38:58.612 --> 38:59.012
No.

38:59.153 --> 39:03.416
He, well... Of course, he was only 29 years old, too.

39:03.456 --> 39:04.297
We forget that.

39:04.317 --> 39:06.939
I mean, that's the sort of tragic part of it all.

39:08.781 --> 39:13.244
He's... He's fatal flaw.

39:13.264 --> 39:13.945
Yeah, well...

39:14.819 --> 39:16.340
That was just an off-wall question.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.341
No, no, I'm trying to think.

39:17.401 --> 39:18.522
You know, it's a good question.

39:19.924 --> 39:23.887
I suppose, you know, he got in too deep to a game.

39:25.008 --> 39:41.704
One gets the impression he's in this certainly not because he believes in upholding the government against the Catholic threat or because he, you know, it's not a matter of principle that draws Marlow into this game.

39:42.055 --> 39:46.344
So it is more the idea that this is dangerous but rather exciting.

39:46.364 --> 39:59.070
You'd like to think that, given the times and how dangerous they were, I mean, to really express your opinion, if it went against the grain, I mean, Shakespeare was a master of staying the hell out of trouble, wasn't he?

39:59.090 --> 40:01.495
Yeah, that's what one gets.

40:01.515 --> 40:03.118
He seems to have kept his...

40:03.098 --> 40:11.491
This guy should have, I mean, you almost say, cool, take it easy, I mean, but he doesn't do that.

40:12.914 --> 40:17.661
You know, he was certainly detested by many people, his contemporaries.

40:18.242 --> 40:18.463
Marlow.

40:18.643 --> 40:20.005
Marlow was.

40:20.205 --> 40:22.068
What is your feeling for the guy?

40:22.088 --> 40:23.511
How do you end up here?

40:23.891 --> 40:30.642
Well, some of the sort of implications of what I've sort of found out about him,

40:30.892 --> 40:40.283
to some extent what I've speculated about it on the basis of what I've found, are pretty, you know, they're pretty disturbing, if you like.

40:40.303 --> 40:55.841
I mean, particularly, one thing that always, one thing that does worry me is this idea that it probably turns out that he was something of a spy on the people who were actually his patrons and protectors.

40:56.762 --> 40:59.785
These characters like North Strange and the Earl of Northumberland

40:59.917 --> 41:21.268
who we know to have been his patrons, but, you know, you look at it from this certain angle, you look at their slightly parlous political position, both as young, high-pedigree Catholics, looked on by Catholic revolutionaries as possible figureheads for a Catholic uprising, and so on and so forth.

41:21.288 --> 41:29.400
You look at Marlowe in their entourage, you look at Marlowe's connections with the government espionage, sort of,

41:30.275 --> 41:43.352
efforts, you think, well, of course, he's there partly because he's a poet and he's a witchy companion and they want him there, but he's also there because the government thinks it's useful for him.

41:44.233 --> 41:59.472
And the idea he's probably, at least to some extent, sort of feeding back information to the government about what's going on in the circles of people like Lord Strange and the Earl of Northumber, in these rather disaffected intellectual circles.

41:59.890 --> 42:11.251
So that's a point at which the idea that this is all a rather kind of roguish game that's involved in becomes something a little more nasty.

42:11.351 --> 42:13.835
So you think, you know, well, I don't really like that.

42:13.855 --> 42:19.045
And it's 400 years ago, but even so I don't really like it.

42:19.646 --> 42:21.409
So, you know, I don't think everything...

42:22.570 --> 42:42.157
I would, I'm a great admirer of Marlow, but it's certainly qualified to some extent by that feeling that, you know, there is an element of betrayal in the sort of things he was doing, and God knows, I mean, there's a whole lot of stuff that he was up to, no doubt, which one has the faintest idea about it.

42:42.177 --> 42:43.819
It will be, you know, even worse.

42:43.839 --> 42:48.105
Who knows what people suffered as a result of his activities.

42:48.423 --> 42:50.546
There's a context, obviously.

42:50.566 --> 42:54.292
This is the name of the game in those days to some extent.

42:56.255 --> 42:59.880
Conversely, one doesn't actually know what kind of pressures he was under.

43:01.703 --> 43:11.517
Are you surprised that a lot of the material that does exist was not destroyed or that there wasn't more of a cover-up than there might have been?

43:11.998 --> 43:16.945
Well, I think the answer to that really is that

43:17.330 --> 43:32.694
A lot of the stuff that we have available to us today as sort of archival historian has available to him that wasn't available at all to the average people either.

43:33.274 --> 43:43.630
So we're reading private correspondence, we're reading official government or confidential government minutes.

43:43.650 --> 43:46.054
But does it surprise you that it survived?

43:46.287 --> 43:59.408
Well, I think in that sense it's not quite so surprising in that it survives only as part of confidential official government papers.

43:59.768 --> 44:06.118
In other words, none of this stuff that one's using, or very little of the stuff that one's using,

44:06.773 --> 44:10.117
would ever have been in any sense in the public domain.

44:10.277 --> 44:12.059
So perhaps they didn't feel the need.

44:12.079 --> 44:14.221
Yeah, they didn't really think the way we do today.

44:14.562 --> 44:26.295
I mean, there was no reason to think that there would be inquiring reporters or journalists coming in and pouring over this stuff and, you know, exercising Freedom of Information Acts and things like that.

44:26.315 --> 44:30.159
They were unaccountable, you know, and that was very, very unaccountable.

44:30.940 --> 44:35.245
And as you say, they probably didn't entertain the possibility that it would ever

44:36.659 --> 44:44.736
So they didn't, to some extent, feel the need to destroy things, but having said that, of course, who knows what was destroyed.

44:44.836 --> 44:46.380
What would you have liked to have seen?

44:46.440 --> 44:56.862
What were you hoping to find when you were going through that stuff that say that you didn't, that would have really closed the deal for you?

44:57.280 --> 45:12.101
I never found what I believe must be the case, but I never found any document that physically, or specifically rather, linked Marlowe with those three people that he met up with.

45:13.403 --> 45:21.394
I mean, obviously, the fact that they met up implies some kind of link, and all sorts of circumstantial links within the intelligence service.

45:21.414 --> 45:25.600
You know what's a telling detail to me, and what I hadn't realized, is that they weren't in a tavern.

45:26.221 --> 45:31.849
I mean, this was not just some kind of idle day in a bar, you know what I mean?

45:31.949 --> 45:32.951
That's right.

45:33.171 --> 45:35.254
That's a pretty interesting point to me.

45:35.435 --> 45:53.241
Part of the disinformation, I mean, whether it's intended disinformation or whether it's just sort of the way that rumors and hearsays work, but the idea that it was a tavern all sort of changes the nature of the thing so radically, and one gets back behind that idea that

45:53.828 --> 45:57.772
I think, yeah, as you say, it makes it a whole different story.

45:58.373 --> 46:01.757
And, you know, one could regard that as, to some extent, a cover-up.

46:01.837 --> 46:09.866
You know, the fact that everyone seems to think it was a tavern ball sort of almost... Spontaneous, but it doesn't seem to be that at all.

46:11.167 --> 46:22.840
And, in fact, that he's killed long after the bill was, you know, I mean, it wasn't like where we're arguing over the checks on the table, you know, we're saying, anti-up, you know, that's not how it happened.

46:23.174 --> 46:30.929
Yes, I mean, they've been together for at least seven to ten hours.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.213
Well, they've been, no, at least eight hours.

46:33.293 --> 46:33.734
Sure.

46:33.754 --> 46:41.268
Because they meet at ten and they go for supper at six or eight hours, and then the killing happens unspecified for the time after that.

46:41.709 --> 46:43.933
So it's, yeah, I mean, there's...

46:44.251 --> 46:47.154
It's not just a, yeah, it's not just a quick drink together.

46:47.174 --> 46:55.043
Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were some newspapers, you know, you could go to the morgue, you know, what we call them, pull the clips on the stuff.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.184
Well, it's a double-edged thing, of course.

46:56.204 --> 47:04.413
Once you've committed your theories to print, you're kind of dreading the sudden discovery of another bit of paper.

47:04.453 --> 47:10.439
Yeah, the coroner's report is really maddening, too, isn't it, for what it doesn't tell you?

47:10.800 --> 47:11.220
Yes.

47:12.415 --> 47:18.000
I mean, I don't sort of go down the line that the coroner's report is in itself a kind of cover-up.

47:18.020 --> 47:19.342
I mean, people have said this.

47:19.562 --> 47:24.547
As we've said earlier, I'm not the first conspiracy theorist by any means.

47:26.829 --> 47:35.918
People have certainly sort of suggested that, you know, this whole coroner's inquest was a deliberate cover-up in itself.

47:36.438 --> 47:38.420
I don't myself see it that way.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.123
I think it was a perfectly straight-up piece of

47:41.558 --> 47:46.223
He was added to determine cause of death, I guess that's about it.

47:46.564 --> 47:52.270
Yes, I mean, I think the cover-up is a question of what the witnesses told the coroner.

47:53.552 --> 47:55.814
Why is the price of the dagger such a big deal?

47:55.834 --> 48:07.127
I think I'm right in saying that it's something that's often mentioned in these coroner's reports because

48:07.681 --> 48:13.291
the murder weapon became the sort of property or was confiscated as the property.

48:13.311 --> 48:14.132
Oh, I see.

48:14.192 --> 48:26.213
Therefore, the value of it was actually a sort of, you know, equivalent to the sort of polythene bag around the suspected controlled substances.

48:26.767 --> 48:32.013
You know, it's a purely, I think, I'm right in saying, a purely administrative detail.

48:32.493 --> 48:44.466
It might be also an idea that a 12-penny dagger tells us or told someone then what kind of dagger it was, you know, whether a 12-penny dagger was probably considered to be a certain size.

48:46.028 --> 48:52.555
But it's, I don't think there's much that one can

48:53.902 --> 48:55.064
discerned from it now.

48:55.164 --> 48:59.590
It just always strikes me as a rather nice detail that it was a 12-penny dagger.

48:59.610 --> 49:04.838
Of course, that's actually not by any means a cheap dagger, which is what I might think that is.

49:04.878 --> 49:11.748
12 pence is actually, as I reckon, it's probably about 25 quid.

49:12.569 --> 49:15.994
Can I ask you a question unrelated to this study and not for this piece?

49:16.565 --> 49:23.092
but you are certainly well-versed in the Elizabethan period and the figures, the people.

49:24.333 --> 49:28.578
I've recently written something, and it's a book that's under submission.

49:28.758 --> 49:42.633
Oh, it's a book on bibliomania, on book madness through the centuries, and I have a chapter on Rule Britannia, the British book collectors.

49:42.653 --> 49:46.437
Of course, I have a wonderful section on Robert Cotton,

49:46.417 --> 50:04.139
And, you know, I can not find anywhere, and I'm suspecting that nobody's ever posited this, that Cotton and Shakespeare might have been friends and that Shakespeare might have read a lot of his things in Cotton's library.

50:04.460 --> 50:08.665
It would certainly be possible, Nick.

50:08.685 --> 50:10.467
I don't know of any

50:11.408 --> 50:12.809
for evidence.

50:13.029 --> 50:15.712
Believe me, I've scoured the sources on this.

50:15.792 --> 50:17.093
I'm just wondering.

50:17.413 --> 50:33.668
My sense is, and I'm kind of pleased about it, because I put forward, you know, I have a few things that I think, I suggest, for instance, that the model for Prospero might have been John Dee.

50:34.249 --> 50:35.410
Ah, well, absolutely.

50:35.830 --> 50:38.492
But I've never seen that, even Jeffrey Bullock doesn't say that.

50:38.512 --> 50:41.415
Well, I think that, you know, I mean, Francis Yates is sort of,

50:41.395 --> 50:45.379
That's fine, that's good.

50:45.479 --> 50:49.103
I don't want to disappoint you by sort of saying someone said it before, but it has been.

50:49.363 --> 50:50.144
Is that right?

50:50.204 --> 50:52.206
That has been positive, certainly, yes.

50:52.226 --> 50:52.586
It has.

50:53.307 --> 50:54.909
That's fine, that's fine.

50:56.090 --> 51:06.340
But you see, I don't know if you, are you familiar then with the, this has been, I think Aubrey reported that when Dee died,

51:06.877 --> 51:17.155
when John Dee died, Cotton bought up a piece of land owned by him on the rumor that Dee had buried his books in the ground.

51:18.558 --> 51:20.962
What does Prospero do at the end of the play?

51:21.663 --> 51:22.665
He buries his books.

51:22.765 --> 51:26.792
And beyond that,

51:26.772 --> 51:39.411
Of course, if Shakespeare had been friendly with cotton, I mean, and here he brought Dee's stuff, maybe they sat around the fire and talked about these stories about the crazy old alchemist.

51:39.531 --> 51:40.373
It's just a theory.

51:40.433 --> 51:44.479
Of course, Johnson writes at great length about how he has a play, The Alchemist.

51:45.160 --> 51:48.645
Absolutely, which again, The Alchemist and The Tempest, of course, are more or less

51:48.997 --> 51:50.599
Exactly.

51:51.020 --> 52:08.742
Well, I mean, I'm not trying to do anything revolutionary here, but I am certainly suggesting that where there were no libraries, formal libraries in those days, that I'm trying to demonstrate, you know, the contribution of these collectors.

52:09.082 --> 52:09.583
Absolutely.

52:09.603 --> 52:13.688
Well, Dee's library was, without doubt, one of the great sort of, you know,

52:13.668 --> 52:19.154
meetings or places or places of pilgrimage for that is... Cotton, you mean?

52:19.915 --> 52:20.115
Yeah.

52:20.576 --> 52:22.999
Anyway, okay, that's just... Yates.

52:23.159 --> 52:25.321
What was Yates's book, just by chance?

52:25.361 --> 52:26.863
Francis Yates.

52:28.445 --> 52:29.987
Well... That's Y-A, right?

52:30.948 --> 52:31.248
Pardon?

52:31.468 --> 52:32.069
Y-A-T-E-S.

52:32.469 --> 52:33.771
Y-A-T-E-S, yeah.

52:33.831 --> 52:35.012
Francis with an A-E.

52:35.273 --> 52:36.093
Okay.

52:36.194 --> 52:36.874
Oh, this is a woman.

52:36.954 --> 52:37.615
Okay.

52:38.276 --> 52:38.376
Yeah.

52:39.082 --> 52:41.347
She's a, she's a, I'll find it, I'll find it.

52:41.687 --> 52:43.090
She's, well, she's dead now.

52:43.130 --> 52:45.916
She's, she's, she died about 10 years ago.

52:45.936 --> 52:47.660
Okay, no, no, I'm going to just, I'll find it.

52:47.760 --> 52:54.053
I think the one you want to look at is, it's called the Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age.

52:54.337 --> 52:55.579
I've got to find that, okay.

52:55.899 --> 52:58.523
It was published in about 1980, I should think.

52:59.244 --> 52:59.444
Fine.

53:00.105 --> 53:06.494
And it's a kind of summing up of her work.

53:07.015 --> 53:08.977
So it's her last book.

53:09.258 --> 53:18.070
Actually, I would like to find a scholarly reference that suggests, I mean, I was feeling a little uncomfortable suggesting this.

53:18.731 --> 53:23.938
And now if I have somebody where I can reference this, this actually makes my position that much more stronger.

53:23.918 --> 53:28.206
I would imagine she comes out and says it.

53:28.266 --> 53:29.328
It certainly implies.

53:29.348 --> 53:31.612
She also wrote a book called Shakespeare's Last Plays.

53:32.954 --> 53:36.480
Well, of course, The Tempest is always taken to be the last one.

53:36.801 --> 53:41.930
Again, I'm sure would certainly work around this idea.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.774
But she's a great fan of Dee.

53:44.395 --> 53:46.298
I mean, she's the great sort of...

53:47.037 --> 53:59.039
Well, you can see why I'm a fan of your book.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.924
I have quite a bit of interest in this subject.

54:03.727 --> 54:05.991
Well, listen, I think I've got plenty of stuff here.

54:06.275 --> 54:15.246
Yeah, I mean, I'm very grateful that you're – for your interest generally and for the possible article you're going to do on it.

54:15.446 --> 54:21.073
Well, I am – I should also say I've been – I'm writing now for a number of newspapers.

54:23.035 --> 54:23.135
Yeah.

54:23.155 --> 54:25.878
I've been writing for this Worcester paper for a number of years.

54:26.079 --> 54:27.861
You're up there, based at Worcester, are you?

54:27.881 --> 54:29.563
Yeah, and I don't work at the paper anymore.

54:29.583 --> 54:33.227
I freelance and I'm working on my own stuff.

54:33.207 --> 54:42.940
But since January, I've been offering what I write to other newspapers, and I've got six of them taking it now, which is kind of remarkable for two months.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.041
That's excellent.

54:44.061 --> 54:58.860
I mean, I think, you know, what's kind of grabbed people's attention in England is the sort of whole idea that this spy business, as I said at the beginning, you know, this whole spy business, really, the essentials of it,

54:59.465 --> 55:11.417
and even the details of it, really, have been going on for all this time, you know, and you sort of think of all these... Well, everybody thinks the spy thriller, you know, as a creature of the last, you know, began with 007.

55:11.437 --> 55:17.863
Exactly, exactly, and it's all sort of modern stuff, and it's CIA... Exactly, yeah, it's not the case at all.

55:17.883 --> 55:25.911
And suddenly you look back 400 years ago, I mean, you know, he was even recruited at Cambridge, like... Well, that's a great line.

55:27.038 --> 55:28.722
That's a wonderful line.

55:28.962 --> 55:32.570
You know, nothing changes, especially in the secret world.

55:33.071 --> 55:35.275
There's a good quote to end the piece.

55:36.398 --> 55:37.400
I always look for the kicker.

55:37.440 --> 55:40.707
I know my lead, but I'm never happy until I have my kicker.

55:40.787 --> 55:41.909
I think we're all set.

55:42.310 --> 55:43.292
It's all there for you.

55:43.492 --> 55:44.973
Well, thank you very much for your time.

55:44.993 --> 55:46.395
It would be very nice talking to you.

55:46.415 --> 55:48.237
Good luck with your project.

55:48.477 --> 55:48.897
My project.

55:48.997 --> 55:49.478
Okay.

55:50.739 --> 55:53.982
With a little bit of luck, we'll see it at the beginning of the year.

55:54.703 --> 55:57.846
I'm told we have an offer forthcoming.

55:58.567 --> 55:59.308
It's a big book.

55:59.788 --> 56:03.652
Big non-fiction books aren't in vogue right now, unfortunately.

56:03.672 --> 56:07.556
Yeah, but they have a sort of life that the novels don't have.

56:07.636 --> 56:10.579
They do indeed.

56:10.559 --> 56:15.567
But, well, the title of the book, if you ever see it, is A Gentle Madness.

56:16.949 --> 56:19.594
A Gentle Madness of Obibliomania.

56:20.615 --> 56:21.036
Okay.

56:21.076 --> 56:22.258
We all suffer from it a bit.

56:22.278 --> 56:22.659
Don't we?

56:23.600 --> 56:24.181
Okay.

56:24.421 --> 56:25.002
Good luck with it.

56:25.022 --> 56:25.523
Thank you, sir.

56:25.723 --> 56:26.365
Nice to talk to you.

56:26.385 --> 56:26.705
Take care.

56:26.865 --> 56:27.126
Okay.

56:27.186 --> 56:27.927
Bye-bye.
