WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.478
Okay, and so we are now recording with Professor Robert Gardner.

00:07.498 --> 00:09.841
Let's just begin by asking this question.

00:10.041 --> 00:22.356
What do you think when you hear the president of a New York university, say in Florida, who says his goal is to have a library no larger than a telephone booth?

00:23.097 --> 00:27.743
Well, I think it's a rhetorical gimmick, frankly.

00:28.229 --> 00:48.091
I can see what he's driving at, at least I think I can see what he's driving at, meaning an attempt to save shelf space, to compress knowledge in a way that would make it acceptable to all kinds of people, and to do without the conventional products.

00:48.112 --> 00:55.620
So I think I see what he's driving at, and no doubt he feels that this is some kind of technological answer to

00:55.921 --> 00:58.264
problems of university budgets.

00:58.824 --> 01:01.928
Libraries are extremely expensive.

01:01.948 --> 01:14.223
And I've been amazed to find that in my own university, Princeton, the budget of the computer technology division now is greater than that of the whole library.

01:14.403 --> 01:14.703
Really?

01:14.944 --> 01:20.190
Whereas 10 years ago or 15 years ago, the computer division didn't exist.

01:20.761 --> 01:26.789
So I think that's the direction in which that metaphor is aimed.

01:26.809 --> 01:31.916
But has Princeton, pardon me for interrupting, but has Princeton cut back on the acquisitions of printed books?

01:31.936 --> 01:32.878
No, it hasn't.

01:33.458 --> 01:49.080
I've served for a while as head of the faculty library committee and argued strongly that if the computer, it's called computer and information technology here, if that's going to expand great,

01:50.174 --> 01:54.358
It's good for all of this, but not at the expense of acquisitions.

01:54.378 --> 02:01.264
So we have some policy decisions made on that, but the university simply had to find the funds.

02:02.044 --> 02:11.673
But it is true that in general acquisitions budgets are under siege and have been squeezed and reduced and so on.

02:12.413 --> 02:18.839
But I haven't answered your question yet, and my main reaction would be to deplore that idea.

02:18.859 --> 02:20.080
It seems to me that

02:20.363 --> 02:29.818
the codex is one of the great inventions of all time, even though we don't know exactly who invented it or exactly when it was invented.

02:30.560 --> 02:41.217
But it is clear that the book as we know it, pretty much as we know it, came into existence sometime, let us say, in the third or fourth century AD.

02:42.499 --> 02:45.544
That is to say, we had a book composed of the

02:45.777 --> 03:06.522
gatherings or pages stitched together so that one could leaf through it, the notion of leafing, meaning as leafing, letting the eye run across pages with the page itself as a unit, that machine, I think, is irreplaceable and will never be replaced.

03:06.542 --> 03:10.107
I shouldn't prophesy because that is the case.

03:11.008 --> 03:15.193
And that the notion that you're going to read everything

03:15.764 --> 03:22.658
from another sort of machine, namely a computer, is misplaced.

03:22.898 --> 03:30.073
It's to misunderstand the nature of reading, the nature of books, the nature of book culture.

03:31.215 --> 03:33.520
I don't really feel that...

03:34.799 --> 03:48.497
CD-ROMs, which themselves apparently are now beginning to go out and become extinct, that CD-ROMs or online texts are going to replace the book.

03:48.517 --> 03:50.539
It seems to me they're going to supplement it.

03:50.559 --> 03:59.811
So, in short, I think that that metaphor, if I've understood it right, conveys a basic misunderstanding.

04:01.411 --> 04:08.763
There was a new university that did open out in Monterey, as you know, and in fact they had no plans for a library.

04:09.383 --> 04:14.071
And then, of course, when that story hit the press, they put a few books in there.

04:14.091 --> 04:15.533
I just did a search the other day.

04:15.553 --> 04:21.242
After six years in business, this is California State University of Monterey,

04:21.222 --> 04:30.428
They still only have 35,000 books after six years, and they were purchased for them by a professional collection developer.

04:31.631 --> 04:34.860
How do they teach?

04:35.752 --> 04:39.720
Well, they have students on campus.

04:39.941 --> 04:43.067
They have 2,500 students, and everything is assigned via Internet.

04:43.488 --> 04:52.427
And if you absolutely can't get it electronically, then they will try and facilitate an interlibrary loan.

04:52.407 --> 05:01.439
You know, it is a trend, regrettably, that you do see in some segments institutional areas.

05:01.459 --> 05:16.879
I know at Princeton when I was down there last summer, I saw something in the library that indicates that your university logs more books per student and faculty, I guess, than any other institution.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.543
than any other institution in the United States that you could determine.

05:20.563 --> 05:22.525
Of course, Harvard allows open stacks.

05:23.526 --> 05:26.690
So I don't think they could... We do, too.

05:26.790 --> 05:35.960
So that is quite an amazing statistic on how elemental books are actually handling the goods is at Princeton.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.102
And I forget the statistic.

05:38.142 --> 05:41.466
I wrote it down, but it is an amazing statistic.

05:41.446 --> 05:45.392
How many books did you say are at the California State?

05:45.412 --> 05:53.244
I just checked it on the Internet the other day, and as of February of this year, it's 38,000.

05:54.626 --> 05:56.629
For how many students?

05:56.870 --> 05:59.674
I believe it's 2,500 right now.

06:00.194 --> 06:07.884
And I did an interview with several people out there, and they will be in a chapter.

06:07.924 --> 06:15.814
I'm having separate chapters, by the way, on institutional libraries, national libraries, and public libraries.

06:16.355 --> 06:21.041
I like to do these things through narrative.

06:21.281 --> 06:27.930
For instance, my public library section will be the San Francisco Public Library.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.492
I spent a week out there.

06:29.472 --> 06:37.862
two years ago right after that whole matter broke about their sending 200,000 books off to the landfill, and without even recording the titles.

06:38.443 --> 06:49.216
How do you respond to something like that, for instance, when you hear that not only were the books disposed of, but they didn't even take the time to record the titles that were part of their collection?

06:50.438 --> 06:54.523
Well, I mean, I was appalled when I read the story.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.066
So you have the...

06:57.468 --> 07:06.759
the first emotion of indignation and surprise, and then you sit back and try to understand what they are doing or were doing.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.206
Now, it's true that there are technical problems of library management.

07:13.226 --> 07:17.271
It's true that books get worn out and need to be replaced.

07:17.291 --> 07:26.682
So the first impulse is to say, well, there are some rational people who are dealing with very real problems, and somehow it took this unfortunate turn.

07:27.033 --> 07:43.593
But I think the third stage is that perhaps they thought that they could simply switch to some kind of online collecting and do without the codex.

07:44.053 --> 07:48.378
Certainly in the case that you mentioned in Monterey, that must have been the inspiration.

07:48.418 --> 07:49.720
Oh, that was definitely the inspiration.

07:49.740 --> 07:52.483
And you know, in the case of the new...

07:52.733 --> 07:56.338
library in France, the so-called BibliothÃ¨que Nationale.

07:56.358 --> 07:58.581
Which I'm focusing on in my chapter, by the way.

07:58.941 --> 07:59.322
Yeah.

07:59.342 --> 08:00.804
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

08:01.084 --> 08:10.997
But the original idea was to create a totally electronic library that would be one for the 21st century and would replace the old one.

08:11.017 --> 08:19.028
The old one would be left as a kind of monument to antiquated scholarship or whatever, and a new one would serve the new century.

08:19.615 --> 08:28.707
That, however, as you know, didn't work, and the whole library in Paris is in a terrible mess right now.

08:28.727 --> 08:40.684
So what is lost in the attempt to, however benighted, but the attempt to replace the Codex with online books?

08:43.147 --> 08:44.689
I think a lot of things are lost.

08:45.570 --> 08:47.513
To begin with, one,

08:48.050 --> 08:51.695
that may seem, in a way, the strangest.

08:51.715 --> 08:56.521
It's the actual tactile sensation of reading.

08:56.662 --> 09:08.918
There's a German scholar, I don't know if you've run into his work, called Eric Schoen, who did a book about, it's called Der Verluste Simlichkeit.

09:08.998 --> 09:13.905
It's a kind of strange title, The Loss of Sensuality Concerning Reading.

09:14.155 --> 09:23.169
And he studied the way, over time, people have held books, the way their body has come into contact with books.

09:23.850 --> 09:24.652
That sounds wonderful.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.675
Is there an English edition of that?

09:26.775 --> 09:26.975
No.

09:28.979 --> 09:33.666
It's a little bit extravagant, but his argument is not really silly.

09:33.686 --> 09:38.053
He uses iconographic evidence to show that, for example...

09:39.265 --> 09:55.769
What we take as a standard posture for reading books, you put it on the table in front of you and you maybe lean on one elbow while your eye scans the page, the open flat in front of you, that this position is actually rather recent.

09:55.789 --> 10:08.428
And in the way reading has been depicted in pictures, anyhow, up until something like 1800 or in the early 19th century, people are always holding the book in their hands.

10:08.965 --> 10:21.304
If they're sitting at a table, they might have an elbow on it, but the rest of their forearm is extended off of the table, and the hand is holding the book.

10:21.825 --> 10:25.490
That is, you have contact with the page.

10:25.510 --> 10:37.268
And, of course, the page itself is made out of rag paper, and the whole sensation of touching the page, as you know, is from before the development of industrialized

10:37.737 --> 10:42.643
industrially produced paper is quite a different sensation.

10:43.483 --> 10:48.809
So I'm now veering off into making a trivial side of things.

10:48.829 --> 10:51.012
No, I love these things, actually.

10:51.032 --> 11:04.487
But one of the losses in computerized reading, and I'm an advocate of computerized production, so I don't think I'm simply a sentimentalist on this score, but one of the losses...

11:05.142 --> 11:28.387
is the sense of contact with the book, the ability to leaf through it, to turn pages back and forth, to thumb books, to let your eye wander with a kind of luxurious freedom across this landscape that is printed on the page in front of you.

11:28.407 --> 11:33.512
Now, you could say that you could do that with computers, but scrolling up and scrolling down

11:33.880 --> 11:36.063
is not at all the same sensation.

11:36.764 --> 11:45.217
And the little dots on the screen, of course, are quite different from the ink embedded, actually embedded in the paper.

11:45.237 --> 11:56.513
You could say that scrolling up and scrolling down is a reversion to the pre-codex kind of book in which books were unrolled to be read.

11:57.735 --> 11:58.977
And the act of reading

11:59.513 --> 12:04.839
made the page as a unit possible, or made legally possible.

12:04.859 --> 12:22.359
But then we're reverting to an earlier stage, curiously, rather than advancing to something that is making the act of reading a more open-ended and freer process.

12:22.379 --> 12:23.961
So that's an example of one loss.

12:24.742 --> 12:27.445
The second example, maybe a little less romantic,

12:28.673 --> 12:30.456
has to do with scholarship itself.

12:31.317 --> 12:36.925
So many things are conveyed by the physical quality of a book.

12:36.965 --> 12:57.195
The actual meaning of the text, it seems to me, depends upon the way the text is vetted on pages and organized in sheets, leaves, running heads, indexes sometimes, footnotes, certainly lots of front matter.

12:57.952 --> 13:09.757
You get yourself oriented, it seems to me as a reader, by the way you approach a book, open it, take it in through all of your senses, and then begin to use it.

13:10.178 --> 13:17.513
I don't think many people simply read from one line to the other in a mechanical fashion.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.054
literary scholars called Paratext.

13:20.074 --> 13:23.601
I was just about to ask if you have Paratext as your name book.

13:24.523 --> 13:29.213
And, of course, you yourself have been through these issues, so this is no news to you.

13:29.273 --> 13:36.447
But I think that maybe whoever is preaching a library-less university

13:37.490 --> 13:43.978
doesn't understand the way books work to communicate information, and not just information, but knowledge.

13:45.820 --> 14:00.158
And one of the side aspects of this, if you're interested in cultural history, and books as an element of cultural history, of course, you need a book itself, but modern replicas won't do the job.

14:00.799 --> 14:06.366
And libraries, when they have this notion of replicas, that you take

14:06.650 --> 14:10.815
destroy one copy and substitute a duplicate for it.

14:11.375 --> 14:15.840
But in strict bibliographical terms, there is no such thing as duplicate.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.864
Each copy is actually unique in some way.

14:19.884 --> 14:27.853
And if you're beginning to destroy older books, this veers off into vandalism.

14:27.993 --> 14:35.982
So I think that a lot of librarians faced with severe problems of preservation

14:36.839 --> 14:42.027
thought that they could microfilm everything and now think they could digitize everything.

14:42.047 --> 14:50.079
And this is based on, I believe, a misunderstanding about the importance of the book as a physical object.

14:50.099 --> 14:59.252
So I would argue microfilm, yes, but digitize certainly, but don't throw away the original because with the idea that you've got

14:59.401 --> 15:06.350
If I were to tell you a story, I went up to Cornell University.

15:07.592 --> 15:11.837
I'm focusing on Cornell and Harvard as two extremes in the Ivy League, which is pretty interesting.

15:11.877 --> 15:17.685
I'm doing a little feature on there, the Harvard model of off-site storage.

15:17.825 --> 15:25.155
I describe it as a valley of the kings for books, where they can go into deep sleep.

15:25.793 --> 15:37.557
But at Cornell, where they also have off-site storage and an apple orchard, a former apple orchard, but they are pioneering this whole concept of digitizing as a form of preservation.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.267
And primarily, of course, with books that are out of copyright.

15:42.719 --> 15:50.510
public domain, but once you've guillotined these things, and once you've digitized them, the artifact goes off to the landfill.

15:51.372 --> 16:10.600
And in particular, while I was there, this is just coincidental, they were scanning, this was the outgoing copies of the outgoing correspondence, not in his hand, but some sort of pressure carbons of Ezra Cornell, the namesake of the university,

16:11.120 --> 16:16.227
They were digitizing these things, and then they had determined that the artifact wasn't important.

16:16.267 --> 16:20.934
It was strictly the content, and the artifact was going to be disposed of.

16:21.515 --> 16:23.838
Were these manuscript letters of Cornell?

16:23.858 --> 16:28.886
Not in his hand, but I forget what you call it, but the person who wrote them.

16:29.046 --> 16:32.571
No, they were not in Ezra Cornell's hand, but they were dictated by him.

16:33.023 --> 16:38.695
And, you know, 99% of them probably were thanks to the dry cleaners or whatever, but they were safe.

16:38.715 --> 16:40.058
That can be important.

16:40.078 --> 16:41.701
But I think absolutely.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.365
And there were seven volumes of them.

16:43.986 --> 16:51.201
And we're not talking about a great deal of space, but I think that, and I was up in the scanning room where they were doing this and the young man who was,

16:51.181 --> 16:58.118
fiddling with it on the machine, saying, look, I can take out these spots, this discoloration.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.867
And he was actually changing the artifact, in my view.

17:01.887 --> 17:07.300
I mean, even though there has been everything that you're seeing is a chemical change,

17:07.280 --> 17:11.247
And certainly it wasn't this way when it was written.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.871
You are tinkering with an artifact.

17:14.392 --> 17:18.198
And the intention was... In fact, I had them Xerox a copy of this.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.262
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

17:22.305 --> 17:23.387
It's amazing, isn't it?

17:23.447 --> 17:24.609
It is amazing, isn't it?

17:24.629 --> 17:26.973
That you would actually throw away the artifact.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.878
Well, there was something of a...

17:30.652 --> 17:34.938
plus a scandal created about the New York Public Library.

17:35.119 --> 17:45.394
That's my next question for you because it does go into this whole concept of preservation at the New York Public Library.

17:45.634 --> 17:50.341
The idea here was that microfilming is preservation because we're preserving the content.

17:50.882 --> 17:52.425
It's not the artifact that matters.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.306
It's the content.

17:53.566 --> 17:55.169
And I wonder what your reaction to that is.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.452
Well, apparently...

17:57.787 --> 18:00.391
And you probably have looked up the history of this.

18:00.411 --> 18:04.216
There was a decision made sometime, I believe, in the 1970s.

18:05.078 --> 18:05.558
Exactly.

18:06.440 --> 18:13.791
And I forget the name of the woman who was setting some kind of policy at the national level.

18:13.811 --> 18:24.547
Not, of course, with the power to enforce it, but it was to be a model policy of preservation by saving content and guillotining and throwing away the originals.

18:26.529 --> 18:27.591
That policy...

18:28.567 --> 18:34.533
which spread... I used to know her name and... I don't know her name, I'm sorry.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.515
But you may have that information.

18:36.535 --> 18:42.401
In any case, this... Was she in Columbia?

18:42.421 --> 18:43.642
I can find it easily enough.

18:43.862 --> 18:46.525
Remember, I did make a note of it.

18:46.545 --> 18:47.987
If it's policy, I'll find it.

18:48.587 --> 18:53.292
Well, yes, I think there was some council's libraries...

18:53.845 --> 19:03.500
where this policy was adopted as a kind of model guideline for librarians' concern with preservation.

19:03.520 --> 19:15.718
And the basic idea was the paper's disintegrating so fast, all we can do is save the content, we must do it as rapidly as we can, and that means discarding the original.

19:16.525 --> 19:20.210
Now that, to me, is the vandalism.

19:20.571 --> 19:35.733
Maybe it was done with the highest and noblest of intentions, but of course to destroy the originals is to wipe out an important artifact of our civilization, print culture.

19:36.835 --> 19:45.047
And as a consequence of this sort of policy, which was apparently spread everywhere throughout the world of research libraries,

19:45.837 --> 19:55.150
A lot of microfilming was done, and to be done cheaply, you have to guillotine the spine of the book.

19:55.250 --> 20:00.478
Once the spine was guillotined, then the contents were... No one wanted to rebind them.

20:00.658 --> 20:06.806
That could be done, but that also cost money, and so into the dustbin they went.

20:08.008 --> 20:12.975
Now, this caused a scandal at the New York Public Library.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.710
I should explain, I'm a trustee of the New York Public Library.

20:17.631 --> 20:28.502
And as soon as the president, current president, Paul Leclerc, heard about this, he suspended that operation.

20:28.522 --> 20:30.844
He then appointed a committee to look into it.

20:30.864 --> 20:36.369
The committee reported to the trustees, and the trustees voted to abandon that policy.

20:36.389 --> 20:42.996
We have also adopted our own guidelines, which we hope will serve as a model for the rest of the library world.

20:43.330 --> 20:54.570
which are very strict about any kind of abandoned deaccessioning, as it's called, of books.

20:55.852 --> 20:57.174
I'll give Paul a call.

20:57.615 --> 21:00.460
Are these published guidelines?

21:00.961 --> 21:02.584
They are not yet published.

21:02.824 --> 21:08.494
We voted on them two meetings ago, so this is brand new.

21:09.267 --> 21:21.939
recommended that we make what he called a 180-degree turn in policy about conservation, and that meant saving the originals.

21:21.959 --> 21:22.519
That's great.

21:22.840 --> 21:36.132
Now, of course, it's a complicated issue, and when you look into the complications, you have to leave a little bit of loophole for exceptional circumstances.

21:36.152 --> 21:37.333
And...

21:38.562 --> 21:45.932
I don't think there are... Actually, to describe the exceptions as loopholes is a bit misleading.

21:46.693 --> 22:03.194
But there are some cases, very remote and unexpected cases, where a book might be thrown away after it was digitized.

22:03.214 --> 22:06.098
But we've written the guidelines.

22:06.779 --> 22:07.540
That will never happen.

22:07.739 --> 22:09.141
I'll give a call.

22:09.161 --> 22:15.930
That will be very useful to me because I am going to include that little, not any great length, but it was quite a thing.

22:15.970 --> 22:18.453
That was the Michael Zinman piece in the New Yorker.

22:20.315 --> 22:36.396
Well, the point is that I think it's worthwhile discussing that piece, but you certainly should indicate that the library has totally reversed that policy and is hoping that its new policy will set a guideline in preservation.

22:37.051 --> 22:44.980
But it's an example of an attitude that was quite pervasive throughout the whole library profession at a point.

22:46.042 --> 22:49.065
There was a wonderful piece that you wrote for the Grolier Club.

22:49.085 --> 22:51.949
I have a book right here, Books and Prints, Past and Future.

22:52.589 --> 22:57.455
And this kind of goes back almost to the tactile sense of reading that you were talking about.

22:57.996 --> 23:01.540
But you say the where of reading is more important than you might think.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.374
because by placing the reader in his setting, one can begin to approach his experience of the world.

23:07.557 --> 23:10.044
Are we talking here about libraries or studies?

23:10.304 --> 23:14.095
What exactly are we talking about here when we talk about the where of reading?

23:15.121 --> 23:22.191
Well, I think the where is going to vary, and that's part of the empirical task facing the book history.

23:22.211 --> 23:32.966
So, of course, in some cases, it's the Greek reading room of the New York Public Library, and in other cases, it's behind a haystack or in a privy, or, you know, there are just endless settings.

23:33.888 --> 23:39.355
But that doesn't mean that it, because it's so complex that it can't be studied.

23:39.656 --> 23:44.723
So I think there were more or less standards

23:45.125 --> 24:03.593
sites in which reading took place at different times in the past, and that if one could recover the general tendency of reading, you know, when was it done in groups, and when did it begin to be done by isolated individuals?

24:03.613 --> 24:09.883
When was it done largely aloud, and when did it begin to be done silently?

24:11.028 --> 24:15.614
When was it done with a book on the table, as I was mentioning?

24:16.335 --> 24:26.968
When did people begin to take walks with books in their pockets and pull them out of their pockets in order to read passages by the sunset or in a forest or whatever?

24:27.008 --> 24:36.259
These things tell you a lot about not just what people were reading, but as I think I said, the mental world, the general...

24:36.593 --> 24:42.460
climate or framework, mental framework in which people did the reading.

24:43.681 --> 24:46.805
And of course, part of the setting is the book itself.

24:47.085 --> 24:56.776
So when you have books in small formats that can be taken out of your pocket, that lends itself to a more intimate kind of reading.

24:57.857 --> 25:05.185
This matters terribly, I think, for the experience of literature, which is at the heart of our culture.

25:05.205 --> 25:06.567
So you

25:06.800 --> 25:12.145
To hold a book in your hand, you've probably held some of these books in tiny format.

25:13.226 --> 25:14.046
I even have one.

25:14.066 --> 25:22.834
In the 17th century, they would use books in a sort of moderate-sized format, actually octavos.

25:23.735 --> 25:35.085
They would cut out the pages in the middle, and they could then sometimes, and these would be prayer books typically, and then they would put tiny little libertine tracts

25:35.369 --> 25:47.402
inside the hole that they had made by, if you see it, I mean, by scooping out the pages so you could take them into church and you could read some irreligious literature during the liturgy.

25:47.422 --> 25:56.412
It's, you know, the kind of extreme experience of a liberty that is a free thinker, a reader in the 17th and 18th centuries.

25:57.112 --> 26:04.380
Well, that kind of thing tells you an enormous amount about the mental activity involved in reading.

26:04.748 --> 26:10.270
And it tells you something that you can't know simply by contemplating the content.

26:12.612 --> 26:19.001
You describe yourself as an archival historian, which I think is quite a wonderful description.

26:19.762 --> 26:24.790
And I read that in one span of 11 summers and one winter, you read 50,000 letters.

26:25.691 --> 26:33.702
And this SociÃ©tÃ© Typograph, my French is terrible, the STN.

26:34.263 --> 26:42.535
And then elsewhere, you make a comment about that you will find that book historians often begin by stumbling on discoveries in archives.

26:42.515 --> 27:07.273
I think you could just give me a brief comment on the countless hours that you spent in this one archive, and maybe share with me the experience of stumbling, of making discoveries in an archive, knowing that you have something that really no scholar has ever laid eyes on before, in the sense that you've really come across something that's really important.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.450
Yes, I'd be glad to.

27:09.550 --> 27:15.920
And it does connect with the history of books because these were the archives of a publisher.

27:16.721 --> 27:21.949
And that's what got me into doing the history of books in general.

27:22.430 --> 27:26.957
But I didn't know I was headed in that direction.

27:26.977 --> 27:30.983
And I came upon this archive in the following manner.

27:31.003 --> 27:33.767
It was 1916.

27:35.620 --> 27:53.588
In late 1963, I saw a footnote in a fairly obscure work which suggested that there were some manuscript letters of a key leader of the French Revolution in this town, NeuchÃ¢tel, Switzerland.

27:53.608 --> 28:01.560
The man interested me because he was the kind of hanger-on of Jefferson's circle in Paris on the eve of the Revolution.

28:01.979 --> 28:07.767
He was the founder of a club called the Gallo-American Society.

28:08.287 --> 28:22.246
It was a club of Frenchmen who were just bedazzled by the notion of republicanism, this new republican culture that just emerged on the other side of the ocean.

28:22.266 --> 28:25.871
So these people met once a week and discussed everything having to do with America.

28:26.973 --> 28:31.699
This was one of the main persons there, and I thought that was my subject.

28:33.417 --> 28:48.378
So I wrote, I thought, you know, it costs the price of a stamp, and I wrote to this library in this quite small town in French-speaking Switzerland, saying, do you have, it looks as though you might have some letters by this man.

28:48.398 --> 28:55.408
His name is Brissot, B-R-I-S-S-O-T, Jacques-Pierre Brissot.

28:55.962 --> 28:57.304
Could that possibly be true?

28:57.664 --> 29:05.634
And the librarian goes back saying, well, yes, we have 119 letters, and here is a photocopy of one of them.

29:05.654 --> 29:08.557
And it was a fabulous letter.

29:08.958 --> 29:18.609
He more or less told the story of his life to his publisher as a way of not paying a bill for a book that he had printed.

29:19.290 --> 29:25.277
He'd just been released from the Bastille, and he couldn't pay his bill, so he was in a terrible state.

29:26.135 --> 29:27.537
to explain things.

29:28.218 --> 29:33.284
He gave a kind of mini-autobiography.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.066
Well, I thought, this is fabulous.

29:36.428 --> 29:44.679
It's an extraordinary thing to find 119 unpublished letters by one of, say, a dozen most important leaders of the French Revolution.

29:44.699 --> 29:44.859
Amazing.

29:45.820 --> 29:49.545
I'd better hustle off to NeuchÃ¢tel, which I did.

29:49.705 --> 29:55.973
It took me a while to do that because I veered off into journalism as a reporter for the New York Times, but

29:56.864 --> 29:57.705
I got over that.

29:58.947 --> 30:16.532
I found myself sitting in this library, in this tiny library, actually, really like a school reading room, very beautiful, but full of school kids doing their homework, and calling for these 119 letters.

30:17.213 --> 30:23.301
There they were, along with the replies that had been copied into a ledger.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.145
And as I read through them, I discovered that

30:26.648 --> 30:37.746
The real interesting subject was not so much the life of this man as the world of books, because his life led into that world.

30:37.766 --> 30:39.809
It was a path through it.

30:39.829 --> 30:49.184
You could follow how he wrote his text, basically sent them in.

30:49.204 --> 30:50.105
He's in France.

30:50.145 --> 30:53.871
This is one of dozens and dozens of publishing houses.

30:54.155 --> 31:02.066
outside of France, that circled France like a great arc around its northeast borders.

31:02.086 --> 31:05.611
It's what I call a fertile crescent of publishing houses.

31:05.631 --> 31:17.327
But because of the censorship and the book police in France, so basically any modern book of any interest is published outside the country and then smuggled in and sold through an elaborate underground.

31:18.067 --> 31:22.573
But for the first time, by reading his letters, you could see how this underground functioned.

31:22.593 --> 31:37.833
I mean, how the books were printed, how much it cost to print them, and what routes they followed to get into France, and where they're stocked in various entrepots, and so on, until they reach readers.

31:37.853 --> 31:40.977
So I actually started writing a life of this guy.

31:40.997 --> 31:42.659
In fact, I wrote 500 pages.

31:42.759 --> 31:45.002
And then I stopped, and I said, wait a minute.

31:46.124 --> 31:47.145
You've got another...

31:48.037 --> 32:07.733
a couple of years research to go if you're going to complete the biography but far more important is to try to develop a history of the book and so i dropped the biography and it's sitting in a drawer at home uh that i guess that was in 1916

32:08.422 --> 32:13.387
Can I just interject, this archive is basically shaping your life's work, it seems to me.

32:13.747 --> 32:14.808
Yes, that's right.

32:15.910 --> 32:20.234
Now I've just turned 60, and I'm appalled with the thought, in a way.

32:20.434 --> 32:37.011
But I dropped the biography, and I went back, and I decided that I would try to recreate the whole world of book culture through these manuscripts.

32:38.881 --> 32:41.365
unendingly rich.

32:41.385 --> 32:44.089
Just on the strength of this trip to this archive?

32:44.509 --> 32:45.070
Yes.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.252
Unbelievable.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.415
It's wonderful.

32:48.435 --> 32:55.245
Anyone who would begin reading through these dossiers, I can describe the process.

32:55.445 --> 32:57.007
Here I am reading his letters.

32:57.068 --> 33:04.358
He's trying to, for example, arrange for the smuggling of his books into France.

33:05.099 --> 33:07.723
One of the steps in the smuggling is...

33:08.108 --> 33:15.399
It's the entrepÃ´t trade, the warehousing of books in Versailles, under the nose of the king himself.

33:15.419 --> 33:22.209
It turns out that Versailles was the great warehouse of illegal books for Paris.

33:22.910 --> 33:26.756
And there are reasons for this, but I was amazed to find this out.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.759
You talk about sweet irony.

33:29.380 --> 33:35.449
And then, so he says, you know, the book should be stored with Madame Lanoune.

33:36.509 --> 33:38.231
How do we spell?

33:38.391 --> 33:41.856
L-A and then capital N-O-U-E.

33:41.876 --> 33:42.978
Okay.

33:42.998 --> 33:45.601
So I said to myself, well, who is this Madame Lanoue?

33:45.621 --> 33:51.228
And she turned out to be one of the great warehouses, but a woman in Versailles.

33:51.449 --> 33:58.138
Well, I just looked up her dossier because it was there among these 50,000 letters.

33:58.158 --> 34:05.267
And she turned out to be a very kind of garrulous, wholesome old woman who could barely spell...

34:05.922 --> 34:17.578
all her letters and is fleecing the producers and playing both sides of the trade, maybe spying for the police secretly.

34:17.598 --> 34:22.204
I mean, there was a whole underworld of activity involving this very obscure woman.

34:22.985 --> 34:29.474
And she turned out to be one of hundreds of people all along the transmission circuits.

34:29.494 --> 34:33.820
So I was finding letters like that that made me think that

34:33.985 --> 34:55.791
The real task for me was to try to reconstruct the entire world, the whole circuit that led from author to publisher to printer to wagoner to entrepot dealer to bookseller to reader, and then back to author again.

34:55.973 --> 35:00.219
But did you realize that you were embarking on a career move at this particular point?

35:00.800 --> 35:01.061
No, I didn't.

35:01.081 --> 35:05.327
I thought, well, I'll just do a study of this and then I'll get on to the French Revolution.

35:05.407 --> 35:14.260
Having done that, maybe I can explain the 19th century and the tragedies of the 20th century.

35:14.280 --> 35:14.421
Wow.

35:16.003 --> 35:16.684
That's in which one?

35:16.704 --> 35:21.231
I decided I would just read my way through these archives.

35:21.251 --> 35:22.232
And was it pretty fresh?

35:22.292 --> 35:23.314
I mean, was it...

35:24.104 --> 35:26.828
Had it been waiting for you all these years?

35:26.888 --> 35:29.271
Had it been tapped by anyone else, to your knowledge?

35:29.832 --> 35:43.511
Well, it had not been tapped because for all of this time it was sitting in an attic of the descendants of this particular publishing firm.

35:43.531 --> 35:51.141
And then they began to fall on hard times and to sell off a few of the letters by famous writers like Voltaire.

35:52.387 --> 36:03.778
The town fathers heard about this, and they, in a very light move, took up a collection and bought the archives from the family.

36:03.858 --> 36:05.180
And this would have been about when, sir?

36:06.361 --> 36:08.263
I ought to know exactly.

36:08.483 --> 36:10.825
Let us say the late 1940s.

36:10.845 --> 36:11.726
Okay.

36:11.746 --> 36:12.607
But fairly recently.

36:12.727 --> 36:13.948
Yes.

36:13.968 --> 36:15.530
Maybe in the 1950s.

36:16.050 --> 36:19.494
So these had never been really studied prior to... Never been studied at all.

36:20.034 --> 36:22.056
And then a retired chemist...

36:22.610 --> 36:26.115
as a kind of hobby, cataloging.

36:26.135 --> 36:35.269
And he was one of these very scrupulous, careful Swiss types who produced a most wonderful catalogue.

36:35.289 --> 36:36.652
What's his name, please?

36:36.932 --> 36:40.758
His name is, his first name is Jean, J-E-A-N.

36:41.359 --> 36:46.086
And his last name is Jean-Pretre, J-E-A-N.

36:46.555 --> 36:51.201
T-R-E with a circumflex accent.

36:51.341 --> 36:52.002
T-R-E.

36:52.022 --> 36:53.604
He must be kind of a hero for you.

36:53.744 --> 37:03.637
For me, he's, you know, I should spin a prayer wheel in his honor every day because he did such a beautiful job.

37:03.657 --> 37:07.542
I can't tell you how grateful I am to him.

37:07.562 --> 37:12.208
I know his handwriting better than my own because he wrote the...

37:12.593 --> 37:14.135
in front of every dossier.

37:14.656 --> 37:26.953
He would write on the top of the dossier the names of the correspondence and the dates, the extreme dates of the letters, and he wrote the catalog of the works themselves.

37:27.573 --> 37:38.628
He even produced a geographical catalog so that you can look up any city in France and find out who corresponded with this publisher in that city.

37:38.648 --> 37:41.993
And their business was so extensive that they

37:42.445 --> 37:49.854
had correspondence in all the cities and most of the large-sized towns in the kingdom.

37:49.874 --> 37:54.841
So I began reading city by city instead of... I mean, how do you read 50,000?

37:54.861 --> 37:55.662
Wow.

37:55.682 --> 37:56.002
Amazing.

37:56.142 --> 37:59.587
I would do it place by place.

37:59.707 --> 38:00.428
Have you read them all?

38:01.028 --> 38:02.230
I have read them all now, yeah.

38:02.590 --> 38:11.862
A lot of them deal with places outside of France, but I read those too because I originally thought I would do all of Europe and all...

38:12.348 --> 38:16.933
of literature in the French language.

38:16.953 --> 38:25.662
This cataloger certainly could have... Now, there is a person who could have used a computer in terms of cross-referencing and all this other stuff.

38:25.682 --> 38:28.985
A database for him would have been just fantastic.

38:29.005 --> 38:32.049
But he did this without it, which is even more remarkable, I guess.

38:32.129 --> 38:34.992
He took years and years, and he enjoyed it.

38:35.512 --> 38:40.077
He wrote a little article himself about a very good one in the local...

38:40.445 --> 38:47.617
in a local magazine about this archive, which is very helpful.

38:47.637 --> 38:54.068
And that was, I never knew about the article, so you could say he was the first one to have published anything on it.

38:54.088 --> 39:07.009
And a local, a local, as they call him, that is, he's actually a college, he's not dead, but he was a professor at the local university.

39:07.343 --> 39:12.108
did a book of essays that drew on some of these as well.

39:12.148 --> 39:20.337
But basically, this was 50,000 virgin letters that no one had seen since then in the 18th century.

39:20.357 --> 39:33.030
And, you know, they included, for example, a letter by Marat, the great revolutionary, which turned out to be the second oldest letter in captivity, so to speak, by him.

39:33.247 --> 39:40.317
That is the second letter in the order of chronology that we know Marat wrote.

39:40.798 --> 39:42.000
And we spell his name how?

39:42.500 --> 39:43.662
M-A-R-A-T.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.284
Exactly the way it sounds.

39:45.304 --> 39:46.286
Okay.

39:46.306 --> 39:49.951
You know, he's one of the real boogeymen of the French Revolution.

39:49.971 --> 39:50.332
Right.

39:50.352 --> 39:54.417
The most extravagant of the Revolution.

39:54.437 --> 39:58.223
And I was amazed to find this letter there.

39:59.244 --> 40:01.127
It's the kind of thing that...

40:01.867 --> 40:08.875
Well, you know, just pure gold for a historian, and it was one of the first things I published.

40:09.435 --> 40:13.480
And to even understand the letter, you had to reconstruct its context.

40:14.681 --> 40:27.975
So there are nuggets of gold scattered there, but more important, I think, than the individual items is the whole thing, the entire landscape, which you can reconstruct out of this archive.

40:27.995 --> 40:29.477
To do it right, however, you need to...

40:29.744 --> 40:34.970
to complement it with all the other material available in France.

40:35.591 --> 40:37.553
And there's a lot of that, especially in Paris.

40:37.654 --> 40:48.286
So I spent a couple of years reading in the major Parisian collections in the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, where the same people appear.

40:49.548 --> 40:53.693
The people appear usually from the perspective of the state, because these are state papers.

40:54.432 --> 41:23.916
police spies have been trailing them or they've been arrested or they're denounced in a memo by someone or they go bankrupt and then they appear in yet another collection of archives bankruptcy papers so that you can see the same individual from two or three or more sources and therefore you have a kind of multi-dimensional picture of that person so what I've tried to do is to take

41:24.689 --> 41:53.852
interesting and representative individuals, smugglers, wagoners, peddlers, as well as the small and large and medium-sized booksellers, other publishers, authors, and to have a series of portraits that I think will be a kind of human comedy showing exactly the tenor of life and the actual individuals involved in the world of books.

41:54.254 --> 42:19.485
while at the same time in a more systematic way trying to analyze and evoke the, how should I put it, the system of relations that held that world together, things involving economics and credit, all sorts of notions peculiar to the book trade at the time,

42:19.803 --> 42:23.107
Actually, I haven't written that book yet.

42:23.127 --> 42:29.515
I've written several studies, but believe it or not, I have one more to write, and that's going to be an electronic book.

42:29.535 --> 42:29.815
Really?

42:31.357 --> 42:31.898
No kidding.

42:33.279 --> 42:41.149
So what I'm going to do, and it's now my current project, I've done other things that did not involve history books.

42:41.169 --> 42:44.653
Yeah, but what prompted you to decide to agree to do that?

42:46.035 --> 42:46.435
Well...

42:47.022 --> 42:49.725
Why write an electronic book?

42:50.006 --> 42:50.707
Well, I'll tell you.

42:52.549 --> 42:59.878
I'm currently president of the American Historical Association, and it's a one-year term.

43:01.540 --> 43:15.898
I decided that I could do one new thing, make one major initiative of my own while trying to get on with the business as usual, and that, I decided, would be a program for the electronic publishing of dissertations.

43:16.503 --> 43:25.358
Which Dr. Billington, by the way, told me is what he really sees as one of the great things that electronics can do, is to do the dissertations.

43:25.438 --> 43:28.583
That's right.

43:28.603 --> 43:29.905
I think he's right.

43:30.185 --> 43:36.897
And, of course, there are now dissertations just being put on the web, which is fine.

43:36.917 --> 43:41.464
But the idea of this is to try to set quality standards with

43:42.001 --> 43:49.292
peer group refereeing and editing.

43:49.312 --> 44:09.021
In other words, to transform a raw dissertation, because I believe a dissertation is not yet a book, it's a scholarly exercise that is potentially a book, to transform this into a genuine book, the way monographs have traditionally been, but to publish it electronically.

44:09.845 --> 44:18.616
And the reason for that, I think, is that the monograph is really as endangered as the phrase goes these days.

44:19.037 --> 44:24.945
It's almost impossible to publish monographs in certain fields.

44:24.965 --> 44:33.035
And so I appointed a committee, and it worked very hard to determine exactly the extent of the problem.

44:33.055 --> 44:36.139
But there's a series of interlinking problems.

44:36.625 --> 44:39.449
which I discussed actually in an article in New York.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.029
I have it here.

44:40.890 --> 44:44.055
Well, that describes the background.

44:44.075 --> 44:47.619
800 copies 20 years ago, 400 copies now.

44:47.679 --> 44:48.721
That pretty much says it.

44:48.941 --> 44:50.343
Yeah.

44:50.383 --> 44:51.684
And 400 is optimistic.

44:51.704 --> 44:51.825
Right.

44:52.606 --> 45:02.679
So you've got a crisis in the price of periodicals, in library budgets, in university presses, and in scholarly careers.

45:02.699 --> 45:04.641
Now, the point of this program is

45:05.212 --> 45:34.577
now just launched by the American Historical Association with the Grant and the Mellon Foundation, is to take these dissertations that can't be published as monographs because the monograph in that field isn't viable, to turn them into electronic books and to be published through a special program that we have sponsored, but to make them more, something more than the conventional monograph, to make them a new kind of book,

45:34.777 --> 45:37.502
An e-book, as it's called.

45:37.803 --> 45:41.490
And imposing strict professional standards on it.

45:41.510 --> 45:48.844
This does not, by the way, preclude publication in codex form so that they can come out as paperbacks or whatever.

45:49.465 --> 45:52.431
But at the same time, they will be published electronically.

45:53.609 --> 45:55.472
And I wouldn't preclude that from happening.

45:55.512 --> 46:03.124
I mean, you point out in that New York Review piece, you know, the Star Report was available free.

46:03.304 --> 46:08.572
It was broken on the Internet as a story, and yet it became a bestseller in paper.

46:09.033 --> 46:09.974
Explain that.

46:10.054 --> 46:15.583
The explanation is that people don't want to read a whole book on the Internet.

46:16.087 --> 46:18.090
I mean, on the computer screen.

46:18.110 --> 46:24.618
I don't know a single person who has ever told me that they read a book from beginning to end on a computer screen.

46:24.638 --> 46:28.083
I don't know a person, Bill Gates included, as you point out.

46:28.103 --> 46:39.898
So computers just aren't very good for serious reading on a large scale, for reading a long text.

46:40.819 --> 46:45.385
But they are good for other things, for searching and for putting together and making

46:45.652 --> 46:49.377
links or connections between disparate bits of information.

46:49.397 --> 46:53.483
Now, anyhow, here's this program of the AHA.

46:53.503 --> 47:00.712
What I hope that will happen is that we will produce not only monographs of a very high quality.

47:00.733 --> 47:01.453
The AHA?

47:01.734 --> 47:02.295
Yes.

47:02.315 --> 47:02.495
Okay.

47:03.596 --> 47:10.005
The publisher is actually going to be the Columbia University Press.

47:10.025 --> 47:10.966
Oh, that's been published.

47:10.986 --> 47:12.148
That's been written about Columbia.
