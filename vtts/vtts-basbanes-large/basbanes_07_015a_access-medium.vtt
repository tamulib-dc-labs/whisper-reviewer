WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:04.854
A little bit of everything you know.

00:04.954 --> 00:11.841
It's got printing and bindings and you name it.

00:12.061 --> 00:14.003
It's a mixed up, but it's stuff that we like.

00:14.023 --> 00:14.864
It's quite beautiful.

00:15.384 --> 00:28.317
See, her application is at the Field Museum here, getting their books in order and getting them together, and she has some

00:28.904 --> 00:30.307
interesting discoveries.

00:30.547 --> 00:34.054
Well, what I'm looking at here is a magnificent wall of books.

00:34.335 --> 00:41.368
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine shelves high, perhaps a 10-foot high ceiling.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.296
Well, we got rid of a lot of them when we moved.

00:45.316 --> 00:46.518
Yeah, I had them over here.

00:46.558 --> 00:49.444
We gave them about 3,000.

00:49.863 --> 00:52.166
Did you give them to institutions?

00:53.367 --> 00:54.128
Yes.

00:54.249 --> 00:54.469
Oh, yes.

00:54.569 --> 01:00.356
Newberry, Chicago, Northwestern, Lake Forest, and even the University of San Francisco.

01:00.376 --> 01:01.357
Really?

01:01.478 --> 01:02.619
What's the focus been?

01:02.679 --> 01:10.068
Well, it started out with nothing, and then gradually we got into it.

01:10.088 --> 01:11.610
Books is a work of work.

01:12.411 --> 01:13.593
Books is a work of work.

01:13.613 --> 01:16.917
That's what you would say it was.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.582
We had another one.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.986
You'll see one of the projects over there.

01:21.006 --> 01:24.652
I don't know if you recognize the man who did that.

01:27.136 --> 01:28.257
No, it's quite beautiful.

01:28.298 --> 01:30.160
I love to see everything.

01:31.643 --> 01:32.584
I don't recognize it.

01:32.745 --> 01:33.366
You can tell me.

01:33.987 --> 01:39.976
It's a Dau-M-I-E.

01:40.136 --> 01:45.064
It's a nice one to study, and it may sound

01:47.035 --> 01:51.641
trying to be scatologic, but who do you think did this?

01:53.083 --> 01:55.025
Well, look at it.

01:57.047 --> 02:03.996
Well, I'll tell you, take her clothes off, and then put a tutu on her, and then tell me who it is.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.139
I'm not going to attempt it.

02:06.339 --> 02:07.040
You're going to tell me.

02:07.601 --> 02:08.101
Degas.

02:08.522 --> 02:08.902
Degas.

02:09.803 --> 02:10.644
Degas did this.

02:11.606 --> 02:11.946
Yeah.

02:13.445 --> 02:34.496
So you actually collect art as well as... Well, we do like the Mr... Mr... The reason you see this is that some of them go around... Now, what sort of books are you interested in?

02:34.837 --> 02:38.262
Well, I'm interested in books.

02:38.382 --> 02:42.388
I'm interested in the people who put together wonderful collections.

02:42.841 --> 02:46.486
And I thought maybe you could just tell me, you said you started from nothing.

02:46.946 --> 02:48.949
When was that?

02:49.029 --> 02:50.491
When you say you started?

02:50.511 --> 02:52.073
Well, almost when we were married.

02:52.093 --> 02:57.620
I had started a little before by collecting the first edition and not knowing anything about it.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.284
Just thought it was, you know, that was the thing to do.

03:00.304 --> 03:03.348
I hate to tell you, most of them, we've gotten rid of them.

03:03.508 --> 03:09.956
The years, because unless you're a scholar, there's no reason to have first editions.

03:10.117 --> 03:12.780
You're a scholar and doing research, no sense to it.

03:13.385 --> 03:16.588
I would say there are a good 2,000 or 3,000 books in here, though, at least.

03:16.608 --> 03:18.890
Oh, you haven't seen anything yet?

03:18.910 --> 03:22.012
This is just the front room, I gather.

03:22.733 --> 03:27.717
Well, do you know Nello Bindings?

03:27.777 --> 03:28.538
Have you ever heard of them?

03:28.598 --> 03:29.859
I have heard of them, yeah.

03:30.039 --> 03:31.060
Have you ever seen one?

03:31.220 --> 03:32.521
No, I'd love to.

03:33.282 --> 03:33.462
No?

03:35.244 --> 03:38.166
I'm going to put these papers down over here, if that's okay.

03:41.729 --> 03:42.750
Just don't touch it.

03:43.085 --> 03:46.069
I won't touch it, I promise.

03:46.289 --> 03:47.471
Well, it's a funny thing.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.193
I'm very careful, believe me.

03:49.374 --> 03:55.902
You know, the more you touch these things, the better off it is.

03:56.163 --> 03:58.967
And the reverse is for books.

04:02.271 --> 04:07.038
Well, the book in here isn't worth anything.

04:07.158 --> 04:08.299
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

04:09.361 --> 04:11.083
Let's go over here and look at it.

04:15.400 --> 04:23.848
It took me a long time to know how they do this.

04:23.868 --> 04:24.709
What do we call this?

04:25.209 --> 04:28.733
Well, this is a N-I-E-L-L-O.

04:28.973 --> 04:29.774
Okay.

04:30.614 --> 04:35.038
The book is worthless.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.762
It's a book just put in here for this.

04:40.824 --> 04:41.965
So you bought the binding?

04:42.248 --> 04:44.051
We bought it for the binding.

04:44.071 --> 04:45.453
You bought the book for the binding.

04:46.534 --> 04:46.855
I see.

04:46.895 --> 04:47.175
Yes.

04:47.796 --> 04:50.881
So, in other words, when you bought the binding, you just bought the binding by itself.

04:50.981 --> 04:51.642
Is that correct?

04:51.822 --> 04:53.044
No, we bought it.

04:53.064 --> 04:53.745
The book was in it.

04:53.825 --> 04:54.066
I see.

04:54.706 --> 04:57.771
But this book wasn't in it when this was made.

04:58.212 --> 04:59.213
And when was that made?

04:59.814 --> 05:04.080
Probably between 700 and 1,000.

05:04.681 --> 05:06.224
Oh, my God.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.268
But this is...

05:09.620 --> 05:12.943
No, don't touch it.

05:13.103 --> 05:16.527
I'll show you our other collection.

05:16.547 --> 05:17.468
What is the material?

05:18.849 --> 05:25.656
This is a combination of gold and silver.

05:27.037 --> 05:29.840
And you see these, the apostles here.

05:29.860 --> 05:30.701
It's magnificent.

05:30.721 --> 05:38.749
And then the thing that the secret was that it took us years and now we got it, how this was done.

05:39.623 --> 05:43.928
These were done by the monks very early on.

05:45.189 --> 05:51.456
And it took more than a lifetime because they didn't have anything but leather to polish with.

05:52.637 --> 06:08.415
And we had the book and we didn't pay too much attention to this until we saw some nello in a Vatican exhibit here where

06:09.256 --> 06:15.609
And after great difficulty, they were shone and clean.

06:16.812 --> 06:19.678
Now this is a combination of it.

06:20.700 --> 06:28.176
These are done—they were done by the mugs, and they used substances to go in there.

06:28.342 --> 06:29.404
They engraved it.

06:29.444 --> 06:31.627
They could do that sort of a thing.

06:31.647 --> 06:35.473
That's Christ, and these are the four apostles.

06:35.553 --> 06:39.719
Now, this other side of it... This is about an octavo size, is that what you say?

06:39.759 --> 06:47.331
This, you see, this is impossible.

06:47.351 --> 06:52.018
This is easy to understand, because they hid it from this other corner.

06:52.539 --> 06:53.340
But this isn't.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.602
But what they do...

06:55.848 --> 07:02.755
They engraved these things, and then they put in a material that would turn black.

07:03.796 --> 07:08.181
And then they polished it down, and this is what it is.

07:08.642 --> 07:13.206
And what did they put in there, a Bible or... Well, we don't know.

07:13.387 --> 07:18.272
I think this was put in the... Well, this thing is... That's in Greek.

07:19.253 --> 07:19.493
Yeah.

07:19.827 --> 07:23.170
That's just a book that was put in there.

07:23.230 --> 07:24.872
This just was put in there.

07:24.932 --> 07:30.838
You can see that this is a pretty— What country of origin is this particular binding?

07:31.699 --> 07:37.945
Probably in the Mediterranean.

07:38.005 --> 07:42.090
I mean, where the fighting is now in that area.

07:42.950 --> 07:49.497
Apparently, the Chinese had done it, too, but I've never seen one.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.832
heard of them actually having them.

07:52.092 --> 07:53.274
How long have you had this?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.656
We've had this book.

07:55.936 --> 07:56.737
About 20 years.

07:57.398 --> 07:58.759
How old did you say?

07:58.899 --> 08:00.061
About 20 years.

08:00.081 --> 08:02.523
Oh, more than that.

08:02.543 --> 08:06.868
Yeah, we bought that, I think, in the 50s or 60s.

08:07.068 --> 08:17.138
And the funny thing is that the man who sold it to us, when I came back and didn't describe it as Nello, but described the binding,

08:17.624 --> 08:19.566
Didn't remember he'd sold it, though.

08:19.586 --> 08:19.906
Really?

08:21.307 --> 08:23.229
Did you know it was a Nello when you bought it?

08:23.269 --> 08:23.409
No.

08:23.789 --> 08:23.949
No.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.251
You just bought it because it's beautiful, obviously.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.333
Yeah, we thought that's what it was.

08:28.874 --> 08:30.195
Oh, you thought it might be a Nello.

08:30.435 --> 08:31.356
No, I didn't know.

08:31.456 --> 08:34.999
I had never heard of Nello at the time.

08:35.019 --> 08:42.605
But we began looking and we found that there is such a thing in there called Nello.

08:43.426 --> 08:47.209
This one, there are a lot of them in the States.

08:47.881 --> 09:04.921
The man from here who knows more about booking books than anybody I know, well, took it and got it for me when the Metropolitan had polished it for, cleaned it up for.

09:05.982 --> 09:12.190
And they said it was the best one.

09:12.230 --> 09:17.736
The experts had seen that was up until that was around

09:19.235 --> 09:24.442
70, that they had seen in the States, but there are better ones in there.

09:24.462 --> 09:25.243
That's pretty nice.

09:25.823 --> 09:35.616
But it's, you know, this is, if you tell them that you've seen the yellow binding, I think you said they've seen the last word.

09:35.996 --> 09:36.337
Really?

09:36.357 --> 09:39.941
Apparently it's not been done later, you see, there.

09:41.103 --> 09:43.426
And that's about 1,300 years old, you said?

09:43.546 --> 09:44.046
Did you say?

09:44.127 --> 09:46.329
Well, it's before 1,000.

09:46.409 --> 09:48.432
The binding is before 1,000.

09:49.036 --> 09:49.977
Before the year 1000.

09:50.237 --> 09:50.478
Yes.

09:50.738 --> 09:53.481
It's interesting, aren't you think so?

09:53.581 --> 09:54.302
It's a thousand years old.

09:54.402 --> 09:57.206
Apparently, I think it's... It's fast, more than it's miraculous.

09:57.386 --> 10:03.133
What you see is that, what's in it is nothing.

10:03.293 --> 10:06.797
No, it's clearly... What attracted you to it?

10:06.877 --> 10:10.802
Just was it the best... Oh, we've got all sorts of bindings.

10:10.862 --> 10:15.006
Well, there's a show going on, and I've got three of them.

10:15.487 --> 10:18.891
I'm told you, you really have a magnificent collection of bindings.

10:19.141 --> 10:22.146
What is it about the binding that attracts you?

10:22.406 --> 10:24.569
Well, you get them afterwards.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.873
You see what people have done.

10:26.933 --> 10:41.596
I'd say our recent collections in the book field, because we've had this other one, of which we have a unique collection of Domiye.

10:41.616 --> 10:45.642
You'll go out of here seeing more than you can see any place in the world.

10:46.303 --> 10:46.684
Yeah.

10:48.385 --> 10:50.007
I shouldn't say that.

10:50.027 --> 10:51.509
Well, that's pretty magnificent.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.998
Well, value is a relative thing.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.423
You notice I'm not asking how much things cost.

11:02.443 --> 11:02.743
I have no idea.

11:02.763 --> 11:08.350
But my point is it's beautiful, and it's magnificent, and it's what pleases you as collectors.

11:08.450 --> 11:12.275
It's a great thing.

11:12.315 --> 11:13.537
Wait a minute now.

11:13.617 --> 11:14.979
Where do I find it?

11:14.999 --> 11:17.582
What are you looking for now?

11:18.693 --> 11:22.897
This is Mr. Rosenthal, R-O-S-E-N-T-J-L.

11:23.418 --> 11:28.483
I saw Scott's books, yeah.

11:28.543 --> 11:38.134
Here is the man who was one of the greats at Harvard, Perry Miller.

11:38.294 --> 11:39.495
I don't know if you know how.

11:39.935 --> 11:41.857
He went there.

11:41.897 --> 11:46.202
He never got a degree from them, but he became their

11:46.942 --> 11:51.407
They're a great man, and, well, to be immodest.

11:52.047 --> 12:00.457
Here's a posthumous book of his that was very, very important.

12:02.098 --> 12:04.541
It's a book that killed them, actually.

12:04.641 --> 12:13.050
And it has, I'll show you, the trade one.

12:17.603 --> 12:18.504
Here he is.

12:18.544 --> 12:26.275
And may I show you something in it?

12:27.597 --> 12:30.542
This is just not that it makes the book any better.

12:34.027 --> 12:36.831
It's dedicated to Marie Louise and Samuel Rosenthal.

12:37.411 --> 12:43.981
And the title of that book is The Life of the Mind in America by Perry Miller.

12:44.361 --> 12:46.885
These are all of Perry's books.

12:47.354 --> 12:48.876
Uh-huh.

12:48.896 --> 12:51.760
That's a shelf, I'd say, of 25 books.

12:51.780 --> 12:52.381
Yeah, no.

12:53.142 --> 12:55.846
The funny thing is... Major writers of America, huh?

12:55.866 --> 12:56.347
Oh, yes.

12:56.387 --> 13:00.773
Well, he's been the great man on it.

13:01.594 --> 13:03.918
He's... American literature.

13:04.078 --> 13:05.520
Yeah.

13:05.540 --> 13:06.902
You see the difference here.

13:07.823 --> 13:10.167
You'll see the differences.

13:10.187 --> 13:11.489
And they go all over.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.593
And here is the one...

13:14.843 --> 13:18.087
for a collection that he made of other Americans.

13:18.107 --> 13:20.530
Tell me what started you collecting books.

13:21.331 --> 13:33.447
Well, I'd say that when we were married, which was in 32, it was one of the things we had in common.

13:35.409 --> 13:41.577
So we began buying, and then when we got along, we...

13:41.995 --> 13:49.304
You don't start out for any of this, in my opinion.

13:49.865 --> 13:57.475
You just get more and you like more and you know more later on what's important in a book.

13:58.997 --> 14:10.872
Now, the man we've collected is a man of whom his counterpart in England said...

14:11.881 --> 14:21.736
that he is without doubt the finest hand-pressed printer who has ever lived and probably ever will live.

14:21.976 --> 14:26.943
His name was, he died with the name of Giovanni Mardersteig.

14:27.023 --> 14:34.294
He was born Hans Mardersteig and was sent to Switzerland to

14:34.443 --> 14:36.766
You have some Marderstein here?

14:37.007 --> 14:37.788
What?

14:38.048 --> 14:39.430
You have some?

14:39.590 --> 14:40.271
Okay.

14:40.291 --> 14:40.532
Yes.

14:40.552 --> 14:41.693
We'll take you back.

14:41.713 --> 14:41.894
Okay.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.015
We'll take you back then.

14:43.135 --> 14:46.580
Paul, I'll give you a little, I'll confess.

14:46.640 --> 14:51.848
Paul Gale told me to really, if I see nothing else, he said, see the Marderstein collection.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.590
Well, then let's go right back.

14:53.710 --> 14:53.810
Okay.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.234
Back to them.

14:56.254 --> 14:58.457
All right, you've seen the three of those.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.381
There's a Degas and a Dormier.

15:01.662 --> 15:03.084
Yeah, and a Dormier over there.

15:03.104 --> 15:04.045
A Dormier over there.

15:04.548 --> 15:05.569
And over here.

15:05.929 --> 15:06.790
Uh-huh.

15:06.810 --> 15:09.012
Now, did you get these in Chicago, or did you travel?

15:09.032 --> 15:10.394
Oh, these were all over the world.

15:10.614 --> 15:10.854
Really?

15:11.095 --> 15:15.139
I forgot to tell you a story about that, how things get around.

15:15.199 --> 15:20.764
It was known in Europe after 1970, but it wasn't here.

15:20.964 --> 15:31.635
There'd been a... When Harvard had... Fogg had an exhibit of his works.

15:33.978 --> 15:37.504
They had them, which was called a private collection.

15:37.765 --> 15:39.528
We didn't use our name.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.433
It hasn't been used.

15:42.453 --> 15:45.539
It's going to be known, but I'll tell you the funniest story.

15:46.561 --> 15:57.100
I've wanted to see these, we both have, in other places because the lost wax method means that none of the stuff produced by that

15:57.923 --> 15:59.946
is exactly the same as the other.

15:59.966 --> 16:00.927
What's the method called?

16:01.127 --> 16:01.528
Lost?

16:01.808 --> 16:02.629
Wax method.

16:02.649 --> 16:03.010
Lost.

16:03.230 --> 16:03.691
Wax.

16:03.711 --> 16:04.071
Yes.

16:04.652 --> 16:05.052
Okay.

16:05.072 --> 16:06.614
Well, it's a very old one.

16:08.297 --> 16:17.248
And they've not, for fine creation of bronzes, they haven't found a better method.

16:17.589 --> 16:17.849
Really?

16:18.009 --> 16:18.850
But they vary.

16:19.131 --> 16:20.372
And so we go around.

16:21.113 --> 16:24.258
And the funniest thing I've ever had happen was this.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.901
We were in, I think it was in

16:27.792 --> 16:28.573
in Belgium.

16:29.574 --> 16:35.461
And there we finally got to the man who—the boss man.

16:36.042 --> 16:37.624
He said, what do you want to see those for?

16:37.684 --> 16:40.568
They're just like these others.

16:41.569 --> 16:45.814
I said, well, we're interested in them, and we'd like to see the variations.

16:45.894 --> 16:47.856
And so, well, there is no difference.

16:47.876 --> 16:56.567
I said, well, we see the ones you've gotten here, and they're very nice, but we told you I have some in—what do they call it?

16:56.783 --> 17:01.448
Well, it's in the attic, and we'd like to see them.

17:01.468 --> 17:03.791
Well, they're just like the others.

17:03.811 --> 17:06.013
So we went on.

17:06.073 --> 17:07.094
He was through with us.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.878
And I don't know, I did something I'd never done before.

17:11.659 --> 17:16.064
I said to the man—see, it was known in Europe.

17:16.524 --> 17:20.709
They had unfortunately told him.

17:20.729 --> 17:25.474
I gave him my business card, and I said, we're going to be here.

17:25.707 --> 17:26.708
for three days.

17:27.268 --> 17:30.652
Maybe, and if you change your mind, please call me."

17:30.672 --> 17:41.622
So he looks at it, and he said, Rosenthal.

17:41.642 --> 17:43.344
Oh, Sakagi?

17:44.044 --> 17:44.945
Sakagi?

17:44.985 --> 17:46.186
Rosenthal?

17:46.206 --> 17:49.289
Told me I said, yes.

17:49.950 --> 17:51.611
We had the rest of the place.

17:51.631 --> 17:52.272
Isn't that great?

17:52.893 --> 17:55.056
So your reputation preceded you.

17:55.076 --> 17:56.779
Well, that, it did in France.

17:56.799 --> 18:02.086
It still isn't out here, but there is one of the masterpieces.

18:02.767 --> 18:03.829
That also is a Dommier.

18:05.391 --> 18:05.892
Yeah.

18:06.112 --> 18:07.414
Does it have a name or how?

18:07.434 --> 18:08.976
Yes, that's Radopoldo.

18:09.317 --> 18:10.158
I'm sorry, what is it?

18:12.662 --> 18:12.862
Radopoldo.

18:12.882 --> 18:13.203
Ah.

18:13.223 --> 18:17.108
Yeah, he was his shakedown man.

18:17.148 --> 18:21.094
If you look at it, it's the only full... Who is it now?

18:21.631 --> 18:27.040
R-A-T-A-P-O-I-L, isn't it?

18:27.782 --> 18:30.867
She speaks.

18:31.688 --> 18:44.170
But you see, they say, this is the only one that has no front or no back, because no matter which way you look at it, it's done fully.

18:45.352 --> 18:45.833
You see?

18:46.387 --> 18:48.731
And you see him leaning on it, and so on.

18:48.831 --> 18:49.893
I just feel his name.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.299
So, well, anyway.

18:53.519 --> 18:53.739
Yeah.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.265
Well, we began, and we had some good.

18:57.285 --> 18:58.508
Oh, yeah, so sweet.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.412
Oh, those are no great value.

19:01.853 --> 19:02.274
They're nice.

19:02.314 --> 19:03.556
That's what Art is supposed to do.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.237
It's supposed to do this.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.099
Well, do you think that was Art?

19:05.559 --> 19:07.062
Well, I think.

19:07.953 --> 19:09.134
They're Picasso-like.

19:09.234 --> 19:10.956
No, you're close, but not.

19:11.257 --> 19:12.458
It's Matisse.

19:12.478 --> 19:13.099
Oh, Matisse.

19:13.659 --> 19:14.480
Same family.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.561
Better, actually.

19:15.881 --> 19:18.464
Can I tell them how expensive they were?

19:18.484 --> 19:18.945
If you want.

19:19.185 --> 19:20.146
I'd like to.

19:23.029 --> 19:27.634
How much do you think those cost before they were mounted?

19:27.654 --> 19:28.535
How long have you had them?

19:28.935 --> 19:29.556
A long time.

19:29.796 --> 19:36.203
Well, they were just before he died, I'd say in the late 50s.

19:36.243 --> 19:36.964
Not a lot, buddy.

19:37.518 --> 19:37.979
What?

19:37.999 --> 19:38.760
Not a lot of money.

19:39.461 --> 19:40.503
Well, how much would you say?

19:40.523 --> 19:41.084
Fifty dollars.

19:41.424 --> 19:42.105
Two dollars.

19:44.409 --> 19:47.774
Now they... See, I knew it was going to be something like that.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.577
Yeah, well, we'll go down here.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.005
Would you spell... This doesn't cover.

19:54.465 --> 19:56.809
This is one given to a slave friend.

19:57.852 --> 19:58.833
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.636
What did you say that binding was again, that metal binding?

20:01.656 --> 20:02.637
What did you call it again?

20:03.258 --> 20:04.739
L-O-N-I-E.

20:05.460 --> 20:06.221
L-I-E.

20:06.241 --> 20:07.663
Double L-O.

20:07.683 --> 20:08.483
L-O binding.

20:10.966 --> 20:14.430
You would say that is your great... Not necessarily.

20:14.910 --> 20:19.495
But that's the most unique one, I think, of the old ones.

20:19.575 --> 20:21.758
Here are some.

20:21.838 --> 20:23.920
I haven't looked at them a lot of times.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.543
You can't believe where we got those.

20:26.843 --> 20:28.585
We bought them in Ethiopia.

20:28.845 --> 20:32.608
And I've worked on some other museum.

20:32.628 --> 20:36.452
You can't get the odor out of them from the camel.

20:36.472 --> 20:38.954
They're used by monks, you see.

20:38.974 --> 20:39.755
What do you call them?

20:39.775 --> 20:41.356
Are they book bags?

20:42.237 --> 20:44.639
Samo bags, whatever you want.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.722
They're stink bags.

20:47.742 --> 20:49.384
Here, I'll take this other one.

20:49.424 --> 20:50.265
This one will come out.

20:52.227 --> 20:52.707
I think.

20:54.489 --> 20:55.209
Lovely condition.

20:55.229 --> 20:55.990
I call them

20:56.577 --> 20:58.699
Saddle books.

20:58.719 --> 21:01.422
Well, she's oiled this stuff a little.

21:04.366 --> 21:07.549
And it's a religion I'm sure you know a lot about.

21:07.569 --> 21:09.091
Oh my God, look at that.

21:10.152 --> 21:10.673
What is this?

21:11.434 --> 21:12.235
Oh my God.

21:12.275 --> 21:16.099
That's like a wooden binding, right?

21:16.159 --> 21:16.439
It is.

21:16.459 --> 21:16.760
Well, it is.

21:16.780 --> 21:19.002
A wooden binding.

21:19.022 --> 21:23.327
Can you see what they did when they broke it?

21:23.392 --> 21:25.435
Worms have eaten into it, too.

21:25.455 --> 21:26.637
How old is this?

21:26.717 --> 21:27.619
Not too old.

21:27.939 --> 21:28.400
Do you think so?

21:28.420 --> 21:35.471
No, I think it may be from anywhere from 1700 to 1900.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.793
Really?

21:37.314 --> 21:37.875
But what is it?

21:37.935 --> 21:39.257
It's a religious book.

21:39.317 --> 21:40.599
It's a Bible.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.943
It's a Coptic religion.

21:44.425 --> 21:45.367
It's a Coptic Bible?

21:45.427 --> 21:46.569
Yes.

21:46.669 --> 21:48.151
You all put it back.

21:48.171 --> 21:48.572
Yeah.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.958
And you got that in Ethiopia?

21:50.998 --> 21:51.258
Yes.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.080
Yeah.

21:52.140 --> 21:55.385
From a gila or from a... Oh, dear me, I. Come on.

21:55.445 --> 21:57.989
No, we... There are no gilas in Ethiopia.

21:58.009 --> 22:03.597
We went all over the country and we bought, we were able to get the last three of those.

22:03.617 --> 22:05.560
But you can't go there now, you know.

22:06.021 --> 22:09.646
But did you go to Ethiopia with the idea of getting something like that?

22:09.746 --> 22:10.267
No, of course not.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.130
Well, we wanted to, well...

22:12.430 --> 22:13.752
No, of course not.

22:13.772 --> 22:15.454
No, we've gotten some stuff.

22:15.494 --> 22:21.521
We thought that we might find... There's something that I know is in here and I can't... What is it?

22:21.661 --> 22:26.407
Oh, a page from... by Winklevinsch, whatever.

22:26.427 --> 22:28.669
I wanted it out when any of those kids came.

22:28.689 --> 22:28.829
Oh.

22:29.390 --> 22:34.376
Well, there are a lot of things here that are interesting books.

22:35.758 --> 22:38.441
These are bestiaries.

22:38.521 --> 22:41.104
There's one by Picasso.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.536
There's one by Miro.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.680
There are other others.

22:48.483 --> 22:50.405
Miro Picasso.

22:51.567 --> 22:53.450
Yeah, and Matisse.

22:53.690 --> 22:57.976
Matisse is smaller, so he's down here.

22:57.996 --> 23:00.961
These are pages of illuminated manuscripts, I would say.

23:00.981 --> 23:02.743
Yeah, and these are versions.

23:02.944 --> 23:05.267
They've got one version.

23:05.607 --> 23:08.752
There isn't much in here, so I'll close this one.

23:10.114 --> 23:10.855
Well, there are

23:12.353 --> 23:23.983
And I wish you could tell, maybe you can tell me, when did they change from a four-line stave to a five-line stave?

23:24.335 --> 23:27.720
Yes, sir, I'll check it out.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.302
One, two, three, four.

23:29.362 --> 23:31.044
Tell me what this is, what we're looking at.

23:31.064 --> 23:33.828
These are the things for which the monks would think.

23:33.868 --> 23:38.554
Well, it's at least, it's an elephant folio size, not elephant, but it's large.

23:38.574 --> 23:39.215
Oh, yes.

23:39.235 --> 23:40.016
Oh, these are.

23:40.116 --> 23:43.341
And the letters are especially beautiful here.

23:43.721 --> 23:45.223
I mean, the way they.

23:45.243 --> 23:47.286
It's a page of a musical.

23:47.426 --> 23:47.747
Yes.

23:47.947 --> 23:48.628
Of a missal.

23:48.648 --> 23:53.194
Well, of the monks, when they sing their singing services.

23:53.214 --> 23:53.574
See?

23:53.915 --> 23:54.055
Mm-hmm.

23:54.895 --> 23:56.056
And it's four lines.

23:56.617 --> 24:00.281
Yeah, this one is... That's nice, I think.

24:02.803 --> 24:05.206
That one is Persian.

24:05.546 --> 24:09.250
We've got a Persian manuscript, too.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.631
So what country is this from?

24:11.092 --> 24:11.512
That?

24:11.532 --> 24:12.834
I don't know.

24:12.954 --> 24:15.877
Probably from Italy or someplace.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.399
Look how the colors... No, it's from Italy, Sam.

24:18.520 --> 24:23.805
No, this is probably from... It could be somewhere in Eastern Europe.

24:24.427 --> 24:27.230
Turkey somewhere around here.

24:27.290 --> 24:28.712
This is the Turkish one.

24:28.732 --> 24:33.358
Now this is done by a priest in Iowa.

24:33.638 --> 24:38.965
And I've got to show you something.

24:39.025 --> 24:50.198
He considered himself the greatest man on the Trajan letters, you know, the one on the Trajan column.

24:50.785 --> 24:55.550
And so he used it, and our children had this made for us.

24:56.571 --> 25:08.723
And he and I had a long discussion on the T. The way it is on lower case, it looks good.

25:09.604 --> 25:15.510
But it doesn't look good in the upper case.

25:15.530 --> 25:18.413
So when he made this,

25:19.186 --> 25:31.779
And he wrote to the children and said, I've done this, for I know your father and mother agree with me that the placing of the letter in the alphabet is terrible.

25:33.681 --> 25:34.502
The capital.

25:34.882 --> 25:35.703
Okay.

25:35.723 --> 25:36.604
So what did he do?

25:38.506 --> 25:39.267
RTS.

25:40.608 --> 25:42.951
So just to show you, he knew it.

25:43.511 --> 25:44.052
Isn't that funny?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.915
Well, here are some more of the old ones.

25:47.030 --> 25:50.954
He inverted the two letters in there.

25:50.994 --> 25:52.175
Juxtaposed is the word.

25:52.876 --> 25:53.416
Yeah, this.

25:55.659 --> 25:57.861
What, now, what do these all have?

25:57.881 --> 25:59.142
Do they have anything in common?

25:59.342 --> 26:00.744
Or are they just all beautiful?

26:00.804 --> 26:02.305
No, no, we just bought them.

26:02.365 --> 26:03.046
No, no.

26:03.066 --> 26:06.730
When you begin, you don't begin and think you're going to use them.

26:07.831 --> 26:09.252
But you buy them as pages?

26:09.673 --> 26:09.953
What?

26:10.013 --> 26:10.373
Yes.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.496
You buy them as pages, as individual pages.

26:13.517 --> 26:14.097
Yeah.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.859
Oh, they were very reasonable.

26:15.879 --> 26:17.020
Now they've grown up to.

26:17.506 --> 26:17.947
There.

26:17.967 --> 26:18.928
Here's another one.

26:19.148 --> 26:20.149
That's Turkish.

26:20.570 --> 26:20.950
Yeah.

26:21.471 --> 26:22.091
How about that?

26:22.632 --> 26:25.856
This is that thing, fella.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.498
You don't have to look at that.

26:27.518 --> 26:33.945
Let's give it to anybody else.

26:33.985 --> 26:38.390
And here is the earliest one that Buick did.

26:38.410 --> 26:41.674
I don't know if you know Buick.

26:42.397 --> 26:44.400
D-E-W-I-C-K.

26:44.620 --> 26:45.761
D-E-W-I-C-K.

26:46.002 --> 26:47.283
Not the car.

26:47.684 --> 26:51.709
He doesn't have much value yet.

26:51.809 --> 26:53.131
We just like him.

26:53.471 --> 26:56.715
You saw that Matisse.

26:56.896 --> 26:57.657
I did.

26:57.677 --> 26:59.078
Here's a young Matisse.

27:00.901 --> 27:03.224
That's beautiful.

27:03.244 --> 27:06.548
How he became simpler and simpler when he... Wonderful.

27:08.150 --> 27:10.513
I don't know, Matisse, M-E-T-I-S-S-E.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.994
What do we call this room?

27:16.014 --> 27:17.075
Does this room have a name?

27:17.275 --> 27:19.217
We live in a den.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.358
I don't call them a den.

27:20.378 --> 27:22.219
A den.

27:22.239 --> 27:26.843
And I'm looking at a wall of daumiers.

27:26.883 --> 27:32.908
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

27:33.489 --> 27:34.630
The whole thing is 70.

27:34.650 --> 27:35.591
70.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.313
There are 36 of these.

27:39.114 --> 27:43.217
Now, over here,

27:45.323 --> 27:53.454
If they told you to see the Alphatina Badone, the martyr stacks are in here.

27:53.514 --> 27:56.278
I'm glad I had to clean them today here.

27:57.139 --> 27:59.762
I didn't know you were coming, don't you?

28:00.063 --> 28:01.545
I'm really enjoying this.

28:03.067 --> 28:08.774
I suppose, well, he did beautiful things.

28:11.198 --> 28:15.263
And I don't know, what do you think he would see first?

28:15.496 --> 28:17.859
I don't know.

28:17.879 --> 28:19.442
That's your department, not mine.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.824
Well, I don't know.

28:22.366 --> 28:24.469
Well, they're all different sorts of ones.

28:24.489 --> 28:27.533
Give them the little one I like, the little Chinese thing.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.516
Eeny-weeny.

28:29.536 --> 28:30.978
Well, where is that?

28:31.960 --> 28:40.151
I knew I'd find a hard one.

28:40.732 --> 28:41.633
Well, never mind.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.336
Doesn't matter.

28:43.736 --> 28:44.237
That's right.

28:49.702 --> 28:53.288
No.

28:53.308 --> 28:54.810
But if you know printing.

29:00.839 --> 29:07.430
You just move these things here.

29:07.650 --> 29:08.371
Yeah.

29:08.551 --> 29:17.245
One of the things to show the delicacy of his work is in this book.

29:18.693 --> 29:19.334
Here's one.

29:19.875 --> 29:23.200
I suppose you've seen a lot of Manson's etchings.

29:23.941 --> 29:26.905
Not really, sir.

29:27.927 --> 29:32.193
We've had to have them come out to see.

29:33.335 --> 29:34.978
Well, there are two books here.

29:35.418 --> 29:37.682
This has a face of Oedipus on the floor.

29:37.742 --> 29:41.547
That's the way it came, isn't it?

29:42.248 --> 29:42.809
Now, here.

29:43.530 --> 29:44.452
Oedipus.

29:46.355 --> 29:47.957
And let me show you.

29:49.439 --> 29:55.828
Here's the first one.

29:55.868 --> 29:57.550
Now these are etchings?

29:57.570 --> 29:57.670
Yeah.

29:58.351 --> 29:58.612
By?

29:59.193 --> 29:59.673
Manzu.

29:59.713 --> 30:00.374
Manzu.

30:01.476 --> 30:03.979
Etchings by, we spell Manzu.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.121
M-A-N-Z-U.

30:05.381 --> 30:11.770
Well, have you have seen... He did one of an archbishop's statuary.

30:11.790 --> 30:13.252
He did a lot of statuary.

30:13.472 --> 30:15.295
That's in Rome, isn't it?

30:15.646 --> 30:17.508
Where is it?

30:18.089 --> 30:20.552
What are you asking for?

30:20.572 --> 30:21.734
The Monzu.

30:22.435 --> 30:23.957
It's in Italy.

30:24.337 --> 30:25.719
Oh, they're all over.

30:25.739 --> 30:25.959
Yeah.

30:26.500 --> 30:32.308
But he's known as a sculptor, but he did some books.

30:33.349 --> 30:34.250
And this is one.

30:36.914 --> 30:37.314
Beautiful.

30:38.175 --> 30:41.940
Now, as printing...

30:42.325 --> 30:49.114
I learned the part that shows this man's greatness.

30:49.134 --> 31:03.813
The book was also, this was translated from the original Greek, which he had it done, by one of the officers of J.P.

31:03.853 --> 31:05.475
Morgan Company.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.839
And he did this, he did the English.

31:09.697 --> 31:12.801
And here it is in— No, the translator did or the translator did?

31:12.821 --> 31:16.567
No, the translator, he did the illustrations that are in both.

31:17.268 --> 31:25.179
But this is translated by one of the officers of the—that likes his work very much.

31:27.983 --> 31:31.507
Translator is Edward Waite, W-A-T-L-A-N-G.

31:34.111 --> 31:34.912
Edward Watlin.

31:35.473 --> 31:37.215
Translated by Edward Watlin.

31:37.276 --> 31:38.337
Yeah, that's right.

31:39.987 --> 31:44.814
Well, now, and he insisted on all this.

31:45.755 --> 31:56.051
Now, then, he had it done by another person, and the man who wrote the history of this stuff.

31:59.836 --> 32:07.227
I won't show the beginning part of it, but I'll give it a little bit.

32:10.852 --> 32:21.022
Now, the Italian who he selected to turn a Greek into the other was, I think, a professor.

32:22.343 --> 32:24.145
And he did it in prose.

32:26.207 --> 32:27.828
And the pictures are the same.

32:31.592 --> 32:34.234
But here it is.

32:36.216 --> 32:39.019
But it looks, when you look at the two books,

32:48.145 --> 32:49.326
They look quite different.

32:49.447 --> 32:50.969
They do, yeah.

32:50.989 --> 32:56.636
But the typeface, but everything used is the same.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.279
He was delicate in his designing.

32:59.299 --> 33:02.703
This is showing the importance of book design.

33:05.147 --> 33:05.607
Beautiful.

33:07.349 --> 33:09.212
And you got these in Europe?

33:10.533 --> 33:13.677
I bought this one in the States.

33:13.697 --> 33:17.342
Now the thing that's happened, there's a man in Philadelphia.

33:17.980 --> 33:30.838
And I think he's got the best collection because he has a lot of ephemera, the little things, you know.

33:31.079 --> 33:32.541
We're talking about Monzo again.

33:32.581 --> 33:35.465
No, I'm talking about this collector.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.146
I see.

33:36.707 --> 33:43.937
But I mean, the best collection... This is a, what I've shown you, is a pretty tour de force.

33:44.322 --> 34:04.499
That's because the type, the subject, paper are all the same, and yet they look like two completely different things.

34:04.519 --> 34:09.443
And over how many years did it take you to assemble that Daumier collection?

34:10.384 --> 34:11.185
The Daumier?

34:13.707 --> 34:13.907
All right.

34:16.655 --> 34:17.556
About 30.

34:17.576 --> 34:18.117
30?

34:19.339 --> 34:20.400
Maybe a little longer.

34:20.521 --> 34:22.143
We just got the last one.

34:23.385 --> 34:25.047
A little bum.

34:25.888 --> 34:28.131
I'm sorry.

34:28.151 --> 34:29.373
No, it's okay.

34:29.594 --> 34:35.782
I'll show you the last one.

34:35.802 --> 34:37.104
We got this only.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.037
And the subject is, well, it looks English almost, doesn't it?

34:46.372 --> 34:51.139
Well, these were all people who were in the assembly in 1830.

34:51.159 --> 34:51.900
Really?

34:51.960 --> 35:01.775
And what he did, he made the... He didn't think he was doing sculpture, but it was after lithography, but before photography.

35:02.416 --> 35:06.903
So he'd go up and take wet clay and make these.

35:07.404 --> 35:09.166
He never bothered to fire them.

35:09.647 --> 35:10.028
Really?

35:10.468 --> 35:13.593
And a man found and bought a bushel of them.

35:13.613 --> 35:13.753
Really?

35:13.953 --> 35:14.995
And he was...

35:15.532 --> 35:18.676
He was an art dealer.

35:18.896 --> 35:24.702
And so he made one for himself and put it out on one of them.

35:25.604 --> 35:32.111
And the result was that the customers liked it, so he did all of them.

35:32.151 --> 35:33.012
He had 36.

35:33.933 --> 35:36.436
So there's 36 of the bus.

35:36.456 --> 35:37.337
And what do you call them?

35:38.278 --> 35:40.641
They're by their names.

35:41.241 --> 35:43.564
These are all plots.

35:44.337 --> 35:47.661
The only sympathetic one is this one.

35:48.442 --> 35:50.224
I know the names of some of them.

35:50.264 --> 35:55.309
This is, this one, you see.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.693
I mean, I think that's a kind look at that.

35:58.753 --> 36:00.035
Now, the material here is what?

36:00.055 --> 36:00.816
These are bronzes?

36:01.276 --> 36:01.677
No.

36:01.877 --> 36:09.045
This one is, I just had his name, but he was,

36:10.308 --> 36:11.029
a nice one.

36:11.049 --> 36:13.231
But the others, he didn't like any of them.

36:13.251 --> 36:14.673
This is the last one.

36:15.254 --> 36:17.076
Look how he flatters him.

36:17.096 --> 36:21.782
You can see them all these guys.

36:21.802 --> 36:22.002
Okay.

36:22.022 --> 36:23.303
How long ago was this made?

36:23.624 --> 36:34.997
Oh, these were made in the, some might say, these were made in 1920 to up to 50 maybe, maybe around then.

36:37.540 --> 36:38.121
And

36:38.776 --> 36:41.981
But they didn't sell any of them.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.563
He didn't do it for that.

36:43.603 --> 36:45.426
He wanted this one to have one.

36:45.947 --> 36:48.390
But he could sell them, so he didn't.

36:48.731 --> 37:02.631
Of these, there are from 30, 25 to 30 or more, because when they got near, they all come out slightly different.

37:02.651 --> 37:07.078
So the experts go over them, and if they're going to have 30,

37:07.750 --> 37:15.923
They may select 40 first and put those aside, and then of those, they'll see what are the best of that.

37:16.103 --> 37:20.650
So there are about five, generally, of those that have it.

37:20.730 --> 37:23.955
Now the numbering is in them.

37:24.876 --> 37:29.283
And the mark.

37:29.303 --> 37:31.546
Here, this is.

37:31.847 --> 37:33.810
That looks like 60, 69.

37:33.830 --> 37:35.833
This is 18 out of 30.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.721
Now that's 18.

37:38.741 --> 37:40.022
Out of 30.

37:41.083 --> 37:45.708
And this one, now he's the nut.

37:45.728 --> 37:47.169
Now what are they casting?

37:47.189 --> 37:48.830
These are bronze or brass?

37:49.111 --> 37:50.732
These are bronze.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.314
They're all bronze.

37:52.334 --> 37:54.195
Yeah.

37:54.216 --> 38:00.101
Now that's what they use for the ones we gave some when we moved away.

38:00.141 --> 38:04.385
We gave some Rodin to the... Oh dear.

38:04.966 --> 38:07.508
...because we didn't have room for them.

38:08.686 --> 38:09.808
Magnificent.

38:10.128 --> 38:19.281
Now this is his head that he probably did.

38:19.341 --> 38:26.672
But the interesting thing that he felt that, you see it?

38:26.692 --> 38:27.453
Yeah, that's right.

38:27.593 --> 38:28.695
I don't have to go in there, sir.

38:28.715 --> 38:32.821
No, you don't have to go in, but I'll show you something.

38:32.881 --> 38:33.462
I'll do this.

38:37.610 --> 38:40.153
There's no back.

38:40.253 --> 38:41.014
There's no back.

38:41.254 --> 38:41.514
No.

38:41.935 --> 38:44.458
Here, I'm running my hand along the edge.

38:46.080 --> 38:46.801
Isn't that something?

38:48.783 --> 38:49.904
It's magnificent, though.

38:50.325 --> 38:59.375
Yeah, well, now all of these to go, again, those over there are all Martyrsteig books.

39:00.616 --> 39:04.241
Which, they're the... Those ones I showed you, the two of them.

39:04.261 --> 39:04.361
Okay.

39:04.941 --> 39:06.283
Two of them, and I don't.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.430
Those were Mutterstag books.

39:08.450 --> 39:09.792
Yeah.

39:09.812 --> 39:10.393
The edifice.

39:11.414 --> 39:12.316
Yeah, these are.

39:13.858 --> 39:14.579
I'll tell you.

39:15.961 --> 39:21.029
That's a nice one.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.631
There was another one here.

39:24.114 --> 39:26.277
Here, okay.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.341
He had Christmas books.

39:29.361 --> 39:32.406
And for a little one, these are the little ones that he gave him.

39:33.112 --> 39:35.756
He had stopped it when I got to know him well.

39:36.197 --> 39:37.719
So I don't know.

39:38.540 --> 39:42.346
Well, one of the men... You knew him?

39:42.967 --> 39:43.407
What?

39:43.427 --> 39:44.108
You knew about it?

39:44.128 --> 39:44.930
Oh, yes.

39:46.472 --> 39:48.034
I could tell you stories about him.

39:48.054 --> 39:49.516
We became close friends.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.630
These were the books that he...

40:00.517 --> 40:03.522
He gave for Christmas presents for a while.

40:03.542 --> 40:09.732
1969, with thanks and best wishes for 1969.

40:10.713 --> 40:11.494
Yeah.

40:11.695 --> 40:13.017
Now, this one I bought.

40:14.359 --> 40:15.120
And this one.

40:20.469 --> 40:21.090
They're beautiful.

40:21.811 --> 40:22.051
Yeah.

40:23.774 --> 40:26.338
And this other one.

40:31.145 --> 40:33.727
You find if you don't do this, you don't do it.

40:34.308 --> 40:34.748
That's right.

40:38.432 --> 40:40.954
Do you enjoy going through these every once in a while?

40:41.075 --> 40:42.836
Oh, sure, I often do.

40:45.519 --> 41:00.173
This one is... That one he gave to the man in France, and this one...

41:01.132 --> 41:03.914
to the dealer in France, who's my friend.

41:05.496 --> 41:07.538
Have you ever seen an accordion book?

41:07.718 --> 41:07.978
Yes.

41:13.103 --> 41:27.115
The only one of the artists of this century that I really knew and disliked cordially did one.

41:27.135 --> 41:30.598
Now at the moment I can't tell you.

41:31.743 --> 41:36.427
his name.

41:36.447 --> 41:41.452
But these are all his books.

41:41.472 --> 41:43.093
Would you say you have all of his books?

41:43.113 --> 41:44.254
No.

41:44.274 --> 41:44.735
No, no.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.276
He did 198.

41:46.456 --> 41:54.624
I have about all of the very early ones and some of the others.

41:54.984 --> 41:58.527
No, and I'm not going to try to get them all.

41:58.547 --> 42:01.530
I tried on that and I didn't have it until

42:02.219 --> 42:03.661
So you've got all of that now.

42:03.681 --> 42:05.404
That one I showed you picked up.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.307
That was the last one.

42:08.208 --> 42:09.550
So there are 70 of those.

42:09.750 --> 42:10.011
What?

42:10.151 --> 42:11.453
There are 70 of those.

42:11.513 --> 42:13.877
No, no, of the busts.

42:14.237 --> 42:14.878
Of the busts.

42:14.938 --> 42:21.668
There are 36, and if you count them you'd see 36 of the other ones.

42:22.349 --> 42:23.671
Now what are those busts called?

42:23.691 --> 42:24.412
Is there a name?

42:24.953 --> 42:26.255
Oh, they're all named.

42:26.275 --> 42:27.517
No, I don't mean individually.

42:27.537 --> 42:27.938
What is it?

42:27.978 --> 42:28.979
Is there a name for it?

42:28.999 --> 42:30.201
Like a suite?

42:30.282 --> 42:32.685
He just did 36 known busts, in other words.

42:32.726 --> 42:33.126
Yeah.

42:34.548 --> 42:36.251
And you have all of them.

42:36.271 --> 42:36.751
No, yes.

42:36.871 --> 42:39.115
Is there anyone else that has all 36, I wonder?

42:39.395 --> 42:40.557
Yes, a lot of them.

42:40.577 --> 42:45.284
The man who talks a lot about it is the guy out in California.

42:46.345 --> 42:51.412
Oh, you know who it is, the Occidental Petroleum.

42:51.793 --> 42:53.555
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know who you mean.

42:53.856 --> 42:54.757
Yeah.

42:54.777 --> 42:56.520
I know exactly who you mean.

42:56.540 --> 42:56.860
Yeah.

42:57.862 --> 43:00.205
Oh, I can't think of his name at the moment.

43:00.708 --> 43:07.577
So what of your books, what would you say your favorite item is, your favorite part of the collection?

43:07.597 --> 43:22.896
I don't have favorites, because these are a matter of subject and a matter of a person that he wrote beautifully to.

43:24.238 --> 43:30.225
And it's just fine...

43:30.425 --> 43:33.168
printing, whatever that word means.

43:33.568 --> 43:43.538
His man in, his counterpart in England, I think I said to you, what he felt about him.

43:44.099 --> 43:45.560
And he was not alone.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.062
Others did.

43:47.102 --> 43:49.124
And he was a scholar and everything.

43:50.285 --> 43:51.426
And a sweet man.

43:52.748 --> 43:56.071
Oh, I could tell you stories that are very funny.

43:56.091 --> 43:56.972
Here is a

44:01.542 --> 44:09.012
Here is the, uh... Well, here is an unusual book that was... that was made for me.

44:09.833 --> 44:11.015
Chinese coaching.

44:11.576 --> 44:13.078
I had nothing to do with that.

44:15.121 --> 44:27.838
But, uh... Here is... Here is the, uh... Well, this book comes in several ways, but this is the, uh... catalog.

44:29.621 --> 44:30.402
And, uh...

44:31.968 --> 44:32.749
Is it beautiful?

44:34.672 --> 44:39.078
But, uh, this was not—this was done and printed by his son, but this shows some of them.

44:40.019 --> 44:42.963
We have all of them that we want.

44:45.106 --> 44:50.654
And, uh— Are you still acquiring things?

44:50.895 --> 44:59.106
No, I—we—I'm trying not to—yes, we—well, we got last—no, not this year.

44:59.607 --> 45:01.249
We're trying not to buy.

45:01.837 --> 45:06.262
What do you plan to do, do you think, with this one?

45:06.343 --> 45:06.983
One of the books?

45:07.724 --> 45:11.869
Well, I'll tell you, we only know a little about them, what we'll do with them.

45:13.892 --> 45:28.570
All of the, of all of the, of the Alphazena Bodoni, that's Martin Martin Stein, that the Newberry doesn't have,

45:30.608 --> 45:32.851
They would get the rest.

45:33.072 --> 45:35.675
I wouldn't say it, but there.

45:36.236 --> 45:37.238
They would go to them.

45:37.979 --> 45:40.563
I'll just show you a little of this one.

45:42.265 --> 45:53.562
This is a book that a man, a professor, who thought he was indebted to me, and he wasn't, had done for me in China.

45:54.303 --> 45:55.705
That's gorgeous.

46:01.118 --> 46:05.103
Let's see, I have to put it this way.

46:06.745 --> 46:09.468
That's the spine of the book.

46:11.310 --> 46:12.011
That's handmade paper.

46:12.031 --> 46:15.795
But it's really not a book, as far as I'm concerned.

46:16.336 --> 46:18.058
I mean, it really isn't.

46:22.643 --> 46:23.604
It's an artwork.

46:23.665 --> 46:26.508
No, my goodness.

46:26.528 --> 46:27.429
It goes the other way.

46:28.390 --> 46:30.012
I never can keep it straight.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.466
This is an accordion book, right?

46:35.348 --> 46:40.777
And these are watercolors, I would say.

46:40.797 --> 46:41.838
Yeah, they are.

46:44.282 --> 46:46.826
Well, that's art.

46:47.046 --> 46:48.388
Have you ever seen them do this?

46:51.293 --> 46:54.778
They've drawn it, and this is the Chinese.

46:55.519 --> 46:59.425
Apparently, each page is dedicated to us.

47:00.333 --> 47:02.375
Well, this was done for you.

47:02.896 --> 47:05.199
Yeah, this one was made for us.

47:06.260 --> 47:09.023
This man who felt he was indebted had it done.

47:11.045 --> 47:11.726
Magnificent.

47:12.907 --> 47:14.869
It's a lovely thing.

47:14.889 --> 47:15.891
How long have you had this?

47:17.052 --> 47:19.915
About a year and a half.

47:19.935 --> 47:22.578
No, he came back from China.

47:23.259 --> 47:24.220
He didn't get it.

47:24.881 --> 47:27.724
It took about four years to get it.

47:28.143 --> 47:29.726
Wow, that's making sense.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.348
But look at how they get depth.

47:31.909 --> 47:33.311
What do we call this?

47:34.734 --> 47:36.156
Well, it has no name.

47:36.176 --> 47:39.381
I mean, this kind of thing, I wonder.

47:41.244 --> 47:42.947
Well, let's see what he calls it.

47:43.628 --> 47:49.698
It's supposedly a book.

47:49.718 --> 47:54.285
And here is an explanation of the, well...

47:54.788 --> 48:01.238
Surname, or what they say, Child of Favorite Printers.

48:02.039 --> 48:03.501
Child of Favorite Printers?

48:03.741 --> 48:04.302
Yeah.

48:04.322 --> 48:04.463
Mm-hmm.

48:05.544 --> 48:07.046
That's in Mandarin.

48:10.692 --> 48:15.539
The Mandarin is Wu Da Sen.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.781
Mm-hmm.

48:16.801 --> 48:18.484
And here's what they all were.

48:18.564 --> 48:19.425
They all varied.

48:20.527 --> 48:21.248
Nice figure.

48:21.468 --> 48:22.129
That's great.

48:22.919 --> 48:24.741
Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time, sir.

48:24.801 --> 48:28.945
Maybe we could just sit down and talk for 10 or 15 minutes, and then I'll be on my way.

48:28.965 --> 48:40.477
I'd just like to talk to you generally about your experience as a collector and what it's meant to you, and then I'll thank you for your time and be on my way.

48:40.757 --> 48:43.120
Well, I'll be glad to.

48:44.121 --> 48:46.944
Would you like the facilities while we're down here?

48:47.004 --> 48:47.745
No, I'm fine, sir.

48:47.985 --> 48:49.026
I'm fine.

48:49.046 --> 48:49.146
Okay.

48:53.193 --> 48:58.599
the 500th anniversary of his birth.

48:58.819 --> 48:59.660
Who is this now?

49:00.061 --> 49:00.521
Durer.

49:00.601 --> 49:01.542
Durer, okay.

49:01.562 --> 49:15.458
All right, and I'd like to show you the first proof taken of it, which was given to him.

49:15.478 --> 49:18.181
There it is.

49:18.201 --> 49:21.765
And you see he didn't get depth very well or anything.

49:22.201 --> 49:23.903
A-D-U-R-E-R.

49:25.044 --> 49:27.407
Well, this was, yeah.

49:27.728 --> 49:30.491
This is in a book now that has been published.

49:31.452 --> 49:35.237
But this was done, cut by this man.

49:35.938 --> 49:40.583
And you see, he didn't get very good third dimension, but look at here.

49:41.224 --> 49:41.725
He learned.

49:41.865 --> 49:43.066
That's magnificent.

49:43.146 --> 49:47.732
This is more a typical doer.

49:47.752 --> 49:48.913
Is this anyone in the family?

49:48.933 --> 49:50.335
No, my father.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.021
Are you from Chicago?

49:52.381 --> 49:53.622
Yes, I was born here.

49:55.024 --> 49:56.225
Native Chicagoans?

49:56.325 --> 50:03.432
Yeah, but my mother came from New York, my grandmother came from Indiana, and my grandfather came from New York, too.

50:03.452 --> 50:04.413
We're in New York State.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.898
So we're... Just a few more minutes and I'll be on my way.

50:10.038 --> 50:11.199
Hey, no hurry.

50:11.940 --> 50:15.944
I just went out and did a few things, which I have to do.

50:16.625 --> 50:19.107
I'm just going to put this tape on the other side right now so we don't have to...
