00:03.878 --> 00:08.886
I want to get that.

00:08.946 --> 00:13.212
No, it's definitely not the booze talking.

00:13.813 --> 00:17.338
He's not drunk, as a matter of fact.

00:17.879 --> 00:20.623
Booze over many years can be strange things.

00:20.683 --> 00:24.830
I wonder if the final of the final pages, is he with Andy or is he on the street?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.773
I don't want to ask you to explain this.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.435
I don't intend to explain that.

00:29.022 --> 00:35.969
I don't believe we're asking novelists to explain novelists, but I think I'm still trying to get it.

00:36.249 --> 00:47.800
I would say that the method is not in any way who is connected.

00:48.581 --> 00:57.510
The method is to enter into the secret regions of any human being through

01:01.220 --> 01:18.349
the unconscious, through conscious, through perception from outside, we see Francis behave in an objective way and on the surface.

01:19.571 --> 01:21.575
Just the narrative gives us that.

01:22.256 --> 01:25.742
Then you hear him speak, you hear him

01:26.718 --> 01:29.101
talk, street argot.

01:29.121 --> 01:44.259
Then you have the internal conscious mind at work with him, where he's remembering things, remembering somewhat in the argot of the street.

01:45.961 --> 01:54.632
And then you slide into the poetry of the book, which is, as far as I'm concerned, the

01:55.338 --> 02:07.893
the unconscious element of Francis, the way anybody's soul would speak to an individual.

02:07.913 --> 02:20.127
And it's the things that a man like Francis would not be able to articulate consciously, but which we all have within us.

02:20.147 --> 02:22.290
And I think that's what the writers

02:23.249 --> 02:44.334
charged with exploring to enter into those regions that are not obvious, that are not journalistic, that are not superficial, that are not manners, that you try to get at the heart of any human being you write about.

02:46.016 --> 02:50.742
And that's why I think Francis is my best

02:51.532 --> 02:58.301
because I think I got closer to Francis than I ever got to anybody else.

03:00.544 --> 03:04.850
And I think that's the real achievement.

03:05.371 --> 03:10.038
Do you foresee leaving Albany at all in your fiction?

03:10.058 --> 03:11.680
Or are you here to stay?

03:11.700 --> 03:14.424
I could leave Albany, but I don't see any need to.

03:14.884 --> 03:18.409
I wouldn't know where to go.

03:19.130 --> 03:20.492
I have a couple of

03:21.080 --> 03:44.809
books which i have a parallel book to quinn's book which i call quinn's book two or just quinn two and uh i feel that uh

03:50.375 --> 04:00.526
I'll probably write about Germany at some point, because I spent some time in Germany, almost two years.

04:00.546 --> 04:12.158
It could be that I'll be writing about that period, not in any autobiographical way, but just to use that experience, because I know a lot about it.

04:14.340 --> 04:18.104
Likewise in Puerto Rico, I spent seven years there.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.285
I could very easily

04:19.838 --> 04:30.909
enter into some kind of story taking place for those years or in a temporary time.

04:31.049 --> 04:48.327
I feel that wherever I go in any story, a field of Albany, that there will be probably some basis for it and that it will come out of one of the family connections or one of the

04:51.007 --> 04:53.851
client of Marcus Gorman or I don't know.

04:54.512 --> 04:55.214
It's hard to say.

04:55.334 --> 04:57.497
Well, I mean, Albany then is more than setting.

04:57.557 --> 05:01.624
It's almost a metaphor.

05:01.644 --> 05:02.625
It's a microcosm.

05:02.645 --> 05:03.967
It's everything that I need.

05:04.047 --> 05:05.109
What was that word?

05:05.129 --> 05:05.970
Microcosm.

05:07.152 --> 05:07.873
The power's going.

05:08.014 --> 05:09.516
I had to take my benefit together.

05:09.736 --> 05:10.878
Okay.

05:10.898 --> 05:12.461
But it's the same.

05:14.063 --> 05:18.550
What's the difference whether you're writing about New York City or...

05:20.977 --> 05:42.748
in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, as you're talking about the spirit of the human being, and I really feel that that's the main thing, and no matter where I go, I find that the grounding here is not at all limiting, but there's a capacity in

05:42.948 --> 06:07.285
in me at that stage when I begin to see a human being functioning in Albany, that something happens, something real comes to pass in the imagination and I believe it more than I would believe creating somebody poorest and

06:08.581 --> 06:09.443
in Puerto Rico.

06:09.985 --> 06:11.790
Who is the tourist?

06:11.850 --> 06:13.916
I mean, what is his background?

06:13.976 --> 06:17.025
Sooner or later, you have to... He came from somewhere.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.535
You have to find out, even if you leave it out.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.962
Like Hemingway said about...

06:23.482 --> 06:26.567
The old man in the sea, yeah, could have made this.

06:28.109 --> 06:31.495
You always know 90% more than what you put in your novel.

06:31.515 --> 06:36.923
I'm sure you know any number of different things about Franny and Billy that we don't know about.

06:36.943 --> 06:40.249
But I mean, the characters are real to you.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.915
They've lived whole lives for you, maybe I'm assuming something.

06:43.935 --> 06:51.126
Absolutely, you know, you can envision them doing things in different eras, growing old.

06:51.950 --> 06:57.397
a younger playing ball, Francis playing ball, I can see him.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.680
Billy as an old man, I can see him.

06:59.700 --> 07:04.547
But I'm sure that these people did a lot of things that you know about that you didn't tell us.

07:04.567 --> 07:07.231
Oh, worlds, absolutely.

07:07.251 --> 07:14.100
You mentioned also in Albany that you couldn't write what you do, a wealthy one of my favorite writers about the pre-novel writing.

07:14.120 --> 07:19.307
Well, that's what I'm sort of talking about with the Puerto Rican tourism novel.

07:21.667 --> 07:42.910
If you're only going to deal with the dynamics of the love affair at Capri or the political involvement in San Juan, well, you might have a very good story.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.154
I'm not going to say you can't do it.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.918
Ron Hemingway, what he left out of his...

07:50.337 --> 08:03.552
Novels, war novels, Farewell to Arms or The Home of the Beltals or The Sun Also Rises.

08:03.572 --> 08:09.999
Those novels, there's very little history of Jake Barnes or Frederick Henry or Robert Jordan.

08:10.119 --> 08:19.129
I mean, there's some few allusions here and there, but basically he deals with the contemporary moment that they're involved in.

08:19.666 --> 08:36.937
And that's fine, whereas, to me, the contemporary moment is always colored by this historical baggage we carry with us constantly, unable to separate ourselves from it.

08:36.957 --> 08:43.328
Why do you dedicate O Albany to people who used to think we hated the place where they grew up and took a second look?

08:43.831 --> 09:13.450
to give your comment I don't know you seemed out quite thoroughly in the book but I think you're getting pulled out well the I you know I did write about my own feeling when I went away and I I was fearful when I came back that I was going to be trapped here and and I had a vision of it being a very limiting life and

09:15.826 --> 09:31.927
that I would never really achieve what I was going to, what I wanted to achieve in writing, that I would be stuck in the backwater forever.

09:31.947 --> 09:45.445
Well, after a while, I figured that that was a long-headed attitude, that it didn't make any difference where I lived, and I really didn't want to live in New York City.

09:45.847 --> 09:49.754
or Chicago or anyplace else particularly.

09:49.774 --> 09:51.196
I really wanted to live in Albany.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.141
I bought this house when I came up.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.907
I never wanted to move out of it.

09:59.730 --> 10:00.892
I've been here 21 years now.

10:00.912 --> 10:11.550
It's been a constant source of pleasure and it's given a way of life that can't be improved on Beverly Hills.

10:12.526 --> 10:17.913
Franny Phelan, the trick is to live to beat the bastards.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.835
Does this apply to life generally?

10:19.855 --> 10:22.739
It does to me, as far as I'm concerned.

10:22.799 --> 10:29.888
Just to stay alive, and if you can stay alive and keep working, that's a major achievement.

10:30.508 --> 10:42.263
And sooner or later, you get to, you know, this ironic...

10:47.018 --> 11:12.233
satisfaction you see all these various people who were obstacles in the past they become irrelevant if you just keep moving ahead in your own direction doing as well as you can i mean maybe you can die but if you don't die you get better

11:12.820 --> 11:16.824
The epitaph for any hopes to carve one day in Helen is a huge one.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.027
Helen Marie Archer, a great soul.

11:20.487 --> 11:30.537
I think that in a way most all of your characters are great souls.

11:30.557 --> 11:36.943
It's just maybe a more breaching, I don't know.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.366
This is the type of character that you try to put together and develop regardless of what they are.

11:39.386 --> 11:40.667
They're great souls.

11:41.288 --> 11:43.051
part of your characterization.

11:43.311 --> 11:53.828
No, I don't think that Francis and Helen are great souls in the same... I mean, I don't think that Lake Diamond's a great soul in the same sense that Francis and Helen are.

11:54.048 --> 12:07.549
I think that they've kept faith with some kind of private identity, private morality that has allowed them to...

12:10.685 --> 12:23.307
exist in a world that they never made, but a world of some spiritual achievement, nevertheless.

12:23.328 --> 12:25.151
Black Diamond was not that.

12:25.171 --> 12:30.921
It was a different thing, and maybe that's one of the problems I had

12:31.728 --> 12:57.432
understanding him was that I couldn't profoundly sympathize with him because you just can't accept that cruelty the evil however charming a face it may have and it's an anomaly that you accept him at all but

13:00.905 --> 13:03.667
Francis is no problem.

13:03.687 --> 13:23.464
You know, anybody who rejects Francis rejects him on the grounds of his being a social outcast, a badly dressed, a repellent figure, but not for any moral reasons.

13:23.484 --> 13:30.270
It's that we tend to shy away from failure and not want to associate ourselves with it.

13:31.077 --> 13:36.224
Do you reread your own books?

13:36.344 --> 13:37.846
I haven't read Legs.

13:38.607 --> 13:45.456
I read Legs when I was rewriting the movie script.

13:46.117 --> 13:50.483
About halfway through Billy Phelan as a movie script, and I've been reading that.

13:51.704 --> 13:58.113
I had to read it and mark it to know what I was going to use, what I was going to reject.

13:58.133 --> 13:59.835
And Ironweed, I...

14:00.355 --> 14:02.799
I had to dip in and out of it occasionally.

14:03.580 --> 14:09.008
I'm sure I'll be rereading it again when I get to the writing of that script.

14:09.028 --> 14:13.295
So, you know, I'm not that far away.

14:13.315 --> 14:18.663
I haven't... I don't know.

14:18.744 --> 14:22.670
I think of these books as completed work.

14:25.674 --> 14:28.118
Even The Ink Truck, I had a chance to...

14:28.402 --> 14:51.895
to retool and I couldn't begin to go back and restructure my imagination with the same verve and the wildness that I had in 67, 68 when I was writing that thing.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.757
I just don't think I'm the same person anymore.

14:55.438 --> 15:03.225
Do you, when you're writing, do you see your writing whole, is it pretty well mapped out before you get into a improvisational artist?

15:04.046 --> 15:14.015
No, I think the best thing about it is that you find things out as you go along, and that you surprise yourself all the time.

15:15.997 --> 15:19.900
I mean, I have an enormous amount of information on Quinn's book now.

15:19.961 --> 15:20.481
I've got a

15:21.052 --> 15:27.540
a pie-safe up in my office and I'll show it to you if you want, which is a book in embryo.

15:27.580 --> 15:48.004
I got a whole bookcase full of related books that I want to dip in and out of, books on the theatre, the Erie Canal, the Irish immigration politics in the 19th century.

15:50.853 --> 15:54.820
I don't know where those things are going to take me.

15:54.980 --> 16:07.122
I have the raw material and I have a decision already made on how I'm going to go in a certain direction, but the nuances are everything.

16:07.142 --> 16:11.730
Every chapter has got to be a surprise, and it's a surprise.

16:14.191 --> 16:16.097
letter by letter almost.

16:16.117 --> 16:18.304
It's a surprise for yourself as well as the reader.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.254
For me, it's got to surprise me.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.277
I'm writing for me.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.401
But is the reader there?

16:25.929 --> 16:27.053
Well,

16:27.353 --> 16:28.976
You say surprise.

16:29.237 --> 16:37.272
I must have some surprise in the story as far as I'm concerned.

16:37.292 --> 16:41.120
Something I might say, hey, I don't know where that came from, but I like it.

16:41.140 --> 16:50.037
And suddenly that is the thing to develop that makes sense to me.

16:50.017 --> 17:02.878
That's the story that I haven't read before or thought of before, and therefore it strikes me that maybe this is original and worth doing.

17:07.766 --> 17:09.549
There's a thread there.

17:09.649 --> 17:11.592
You want to talk about the reader?

17:11.612 --> 17:12.193
Oh, the reader, yeah.

17:13.253 --> 17:40.999
Certainly, I suppose the craft of writing is done with the reader in mind, in the sense that you want to make all your transitions very clear, you want to have an antecedent for everything, so there's no doubts about what the reader is reading, but as far as writing down or up or anything else, the reader... Well, I guess you're talking about accessibility, and I wonder, is James Joyce an accessible writer?

17:41.553 --> 17:42.476
Tell me.

17:44.963 --> 17:54.010
I don't think Finnegan's Wake is, but I was reading Ulysses yesterday for reasons of the article I'm writing.

17:59.947 --> 18:04.798
It's a little Joyce-ian anecdote that I was working on for this Cotton Club thing.

18:06.121 --> 18:11.333
So I was dipping in, and there I was at breakfast with Leopold Bloom, and I thought it was wonderful.

18:11.734 --> 18:17.668
I didn't understand every illusion, but then again, I hadn't read that book in a long time.

18:18.931 --> 18:27.243
If I sat down to read it from cover to cover again, I'm sure I would find it extraordinary and love it all over again.

18:27.263 --> 18:37.237
I think it's a remarkable work that is infinitely rewarding to read if you care about it.

18:37.717 --> 18:44.567
If he gets you at the first level where you care about the life of the Bloom family and Stephen,

18:46.538 --> 18:56.708
You know, I don't think any nuance, any small detail, whether it's what he sees on the street or what he overhears, becomes unimportant or arcane.

18:56.748 --> 19:03.394
I don't think it's... I don't think it's inaccessible.

19:04.135 --> 19:08.939
Finnegan's Wake is something else.

19:09.059 --> 19:12.302
That's a nice story.

19:12.322 --> 19:13.243
I still have two more questions to wrap it up.

19:13.263 --> 19:13.964
I had quite a lucky couple shots.

19:13.984 --> 19:16.206
Something is steady or something.

19:16.226 --> 19:16.326
Okay.

19:17.116 --> 19:21.903
Do you feel pressured now by high critical expectations?

19:21.983 --> 19:25.809
Actually, I don't.

19:25.829 --> 19:32.819
I suppose I should, but I know some people get very skittish.

19:35.323 --> 19:39.529
Maybe I'll get that way, but I don't feel that I'm there now.

19:39.609 --> 19:46.279
I really feel that I'm... I can only write what I can write.

19:46.833 --> 19:54.042
I can't do any better than I can do, and I'll be doing the best I can do whenever I sit down for the time writer.

19:54.062 --> 20:03.834
I'm not going to try to overreach my own expectations.

20:06.397 --> 20:09.060
The book I'm writing, Quinn's book, is

20:10.070 --> 20:11.814
As I say, it's already two books.

20:12.535 --> 20:19.370
It was going to be a book that would carry into the 20th century.

20:21.053 --> 20:27.387
It got to be too long and unwieldy, artificial, and

20:28.463 --> 20:33.970
The scope I was looking for, finally, was uninteresting to me.

20:33.991 --> 20:39.598
All I had to do was write two chapters and prove to myself that this is really all I need.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.140
I don't need the 20th century.

20:41.160 --> 20:46.487
I've got the 19th century here, and that's more than I can handle in one book.

20:47.088 --> 20:51.514
I think that what I'll do is... You know, and it's been a reduction like that.

20:51.534 --> 20:54.218
It's a reduction to manageability.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.222
I started off with great...

20:58.720 --> 21:06.848
expansive plans narrowing down.

21:07.969 --> 21:17.779
I don't really think that the critical expectation is worth worrying about.

21:17.799 --> 21:24.546
I think that could ruin you if you worried yourself about what are they going to say about me next.

21:24.566 --> 21:25.707
I think writers

21:27.307 --> 21:31.093
him go silent, like Salinger, for instance.

21:31.113 --> 21:49.743
What happened to him, but his response to the exterior world was certainly so significant that he had to go in isolation to get away from it.

21:49.763 --> 21:54.090
And we have the example of Ralph Ellison, a marvelous writer.

21:54.948 --> 22:12.114
It's been 32 years since we've had a piece of fiction from him, except little excerpts from this novel in progress, which promises to be a great book.

22:12.134 --> 22:16.521
How long have you started to do some of these choice books?

22:16.581 --> 22:22.390
He was also writing a book on the Korean War that he couldn't make work.

22:22.876 --> 22:26.822
I think he's back to that one now.

22:26.842 --> 22:34.693
But, as a matter of fact, I thought Sophie's Choice came out very fast.

22:35.494 --> 22:48.372
Because when I interviewed him at one point about, what do you call it, the slave revolt, that turned his rebellion.

22:49.673 --> 22:51.516
And I felt that...

22:53.572 --> 22:59.279
I thought that was a terrific book.

22:59.299 --> 23:08.170
And I felt that... I remember him saying that he was working on this book about the Korean War.

23:08.190 --> 23:12.115
And then the next thing I know, how comes Sophie's Choice?

23:12.135 --> 23:14.958
So he must have had Sophie's Choice on the shelf and then switched.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.723
I guess finally I'll ask you one double-barrel question.

23:18.743 --> 23:22.127
Number one, I think they related...

23:23.423 --> 23:41.703
your evaluation of contemporary American fictionism among your contemporaries as you read?

23:41.723 --> 23:50.933
Well, I've... I've been reading Updike's criticism and I think it's wonderful and hugging the shore.

23:56.836 --> 23:57.577
I love Bellow.

24:01.081 --> 24:12.696
I have liked very much a couple of novels by Cormac McCarthy, The Child of God and The Outer Dark.

24:14.759 --> 24:17.362
Sounds to me like you're searching, though.

24:18.484 --> 24:24.852
No, I mean, I'm... There's a lot of people I...

24:25.692 --> 24:34.700
I'm reading George Conrad now for some pleasure in a book called The Loser.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.263
He's Hungarian.

24:38.584 --> 24:44.849
I'm reading Kunder as the unbearable likeness of being.

24:45.890 --> 24:54.518
I think he's one of the best writers in a contemporary fictional scene.

24:55.865 --> 25:11.945
I look forward to reading, what's his name, Mario Vargas Llosa's new novel, which I hear is excellent.

25:11.965 --> 25:17.151
You made a pretty split between Americans and God Americans.

25:17.171 --> 25:17.612
Yeah.

25:18.593 --> 25:20.796
That's the way I've always been, I guess.

25:20.816 --> 25:23.239
I've read a lot of Spanish literature.

25:23.590 --> 25:31.244
It's the engineer of human souls.

25:32.265 --> 25:34.509
Have you heard about this book?

25:34.529 --> 25:34.950
I have not.

25:34.970 --> 25:35.691
It's brand new.

25:35.711 --> 25:40.620
It's the greatest book he's read.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.422
It's very interesting.

25:41.442 --> 25:43.405
It's an emigrant who's teaching

25:44.077 --> 25:52.805
Cornell or some place in Canada.

25:52.825 --> 25:53.285
He's teaching American.

25:53.305 --> 25:53.706
He's in class.

25:53.726 --> 25:58.430
This girl is not reading any work, but she's clearly plagiarized, but he's not going to pause a little bit.

25:58.450 --> 25:58.750
It's very good.

25:58.771 --> 25:59.131
I just started it.

25:59.151 --> 26:00.512
The Engineer of Human Souls?

26:00.532 --> 26:04.216
The Engineer of Human Souls, and it's attributed to Leonard.

26:04.236 --> 26:10.621
That's what Leonard's definition of a writer was.

26:10.641 --> 26:11.002
He's got an input.

26:11.022 --> 26:11.282
I don't know.

26:11.482 --> 26:15.047
Have you read Jane Ann Phillips?

26:15.067 --> 26:15.127
No.

26:15.147 --> 26:17.891
Well, I've heard really fine things about her.

26:17.911 --> 26:18.712
She's got a new book out.

26:18.732 --> 26:20.074
Oh, she's got a new book, yeah.

26:20.475 --> 26:22.177
She wrote Black Tickets.

26:22.197 --> 26:23.399
Isn't that great?

26:23.419 --> 26:23.599
Right.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.604
I have not read those stories.

26:26.624 --> 26:27.765
I must read them.

26:27.805 --> 26:31.410
But the new novel is exciting.

26:31.430 --> 26:31.851
It's an actual story.

26:31.871 --> 26:33.253
But it's been getting great news.

26:34.853 --> 26:42.882
I've asked this about all the questions I want to, and I'd like to shoot a couple pictures of it, because I'll shut this off.

26:42.902 --> 26:43.923
I'll ask you a question.

26:43.943 --> 26:44.403
Sure.

26:44.423 --> 26:46.185
About the MacArthur Award.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.807
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:49.229 --> 26:53.513
MacArthur.

26:53.533 --> 27:00.741
That was the thing that really liberated me from the financial woe.

27:02.923 --> 27:03.544
I had...

27:03.963 --> 27:22.243
And from the need to work on anything in the academic world, I continue to be involved with the university here, despite that.

27:23.184 --> 27:28.350
But I'm not teaching, not in a legal absence, but I'm not much involved with the university.

27:28.634 --> 27:31.717
establishment of a writer's institute.

27:31.738 --> 27:33.219
We didn't talk about that.

27:33.259 --> 27:34.501
I don't know if you're interested.

27:34.521 --> 27:35.021
I am interested in that.

27:35.041 --> 27:36.223
Maybe we ought to sit down and talk about that.

27:36.243 --> 27:36.443
Okay.

27:36.463 --> 27:37.604
Just five minutes, maybe.

27:37.624 --> 27:40.227
That's all.

27:40.407 --> 27:41.989
Arthur is a key to what?

27:42.009 --> 27:47.375
The writer's institute?

27:47.395 --> 27:51.640
I designated $15,000 that goes with all the MacArthur fellows.

27:52.701 --> 27:57.747
They will give it to a non-profit institution or to any institution where you choose to work.

27:58.621 --> 28:08.599
And I gave it to SUNY with the hope that they would be able to use it to bring writers in to the English department.

28:08.619 --> 28:14.870
And when the president, Vince O'Leary, heard about that, he said he would match it.

28:15.131 --> 28:17.615
He said, we ought to do something to... It's 30.

28:17.635 --> 28:18.637
It's 30, right?

28:18.777 --> 28:19.539
Something large.

28:19.579 --> 28:21.502
He said, think of it as large as you can.

28:22.063 --> 28:23.025
And so...

28:24.119 --> 28:36.331
I didn't want to come in and work in any way, whatever, so I designated a good friend of mine, Tom Smith, who teaches there, that he run the thing.

28:37.633 --> 28:40.596
And, you know, I'm the ostensible director.

28:40.656 --> 28:49.885
I mean, I've been involved in all the decision-making stuff since the thing happened, but it's now beginning to mushroom.

28:51.247 --> 28:52.708
We're in our second year.

28:52.925 --> 28:55.809
We got to 30, and now we have 60.

28:56.430 --> 29:08.346
And when I got the Governor's Award from Cuomo in the Council on the Arts back in April, was it?

29:08.366 --> 29:09.448
March.

29:09.468 --> 29:16.317
A legislator from Greenwich Village, a fellow named Bill Passanante,

29:16.735 --> 29:21.721
If you want to use him, his name is P-A-S-S-A-N-A-N-T-E.

29:21.741 --> 29:25.886
He's an old-time legislator and very much involved with the arts.

29:25.966 --> 29:34.456
And he said, why don't we have in the SUNY system a writer's program that matches Iowa?

29:35.537 --> 29:38.281
And I said, I don't know why you don't.

29:38.301 --> 29:39.402
He said, would you...

29:39.888 --> 29:48.842
want to run it if we established it, and I'd hang out and be the director for a while and see what happens, get it off the ground anyway.

29:49.163 --> 30:01.002
And so he went ahead and put out feelings to everybody, and everybody was terrifically enthusiastic about it, and we

30:01.808 --> 30:11.798
last week saw the passage of the bill creating the New York State Writers Institute by both houses of the legislature.

30:12.439 --> 30:14.300
Now it remains to be established.

30:14.881 --> 30:15.882
It already existed.

30:16.402 --> 30:24.791
I mean, we exist as an arm of the university, sort of an independent grant operation.

30:24.971 --> 30:29.115
But we'll get more money now from the legislature.

30:29.669 --> 30:34.737
Now, the MacArthur comes unsolicited and just comes out of the woodwork, right?

30:34.757 --> 30:35.758
Absolutely.

30:35.778 --> 30:38.783
Did you have any idea that you were in a writing for this?

30:38.883 --> 30:51.422
A year and a half earlier I did, and somebody at this university mentioned it to me that I was a candidate, but nothing happened.

30:51.442 --> 30:57.972
And some other writers got it that year, and a year and a half passed or so, and I...

30:58.475 --> 31:26.946
I didn't really give it a second thought, and in the meantime they had been canvassing everybody, people at, other people at the university, people who I'd worked with in the council, people who I'd been with in Puerto Rico, magazine editors, book critics around the country.

31:27.314 --> 31:28.576
And all that.

31:28.936 --> 31:34.963
And then suddenly out of the blue came the word in January of 1983.

31:36.705 --> 31:41.291
And they gave me the fellowship.

31:41.311 --> 31:45.856
What does that do to you, I mean, in terms of allowing you to do things?

31:45.876 --> 31:51.283
Well, I have five years tax-free, about $52,000 a year.

31:51.303 --> 31:53.505
It escalates a little bit every year.

31:53.525 --> 31:56.629
As you grow older, they add $800 to your benefit.

31:56.930 --> 32:04.582
and you need health insurance with it and dental insurance.

32:04.862 --> 32:07.306
You don't have to do anything.

32:07.767 --> 32:14.478
It's that wonderful cushion of money that you can do anything with now.

32:14.498 --> 32:17.983
It's like $100,000 a year, salary.

32:18.003 --> 32:22.090
To do what you want to do.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.612
Do what I want to do.

32:24.115 --> 32:37.610
On top of that, you know, the books are making money of some sort, you know, not wildly, but, and then there's been the movie options, which tend to be profit.

32:37.630 --> 32:39.112
And I'm writing the movie scripts.

32:39.132 --> 32:41.434
So again, what do you make of all this?

32:42.315 --> 32:43.376
Well, that's it, you see.

32:45.098 --> 32:46.720
What am I supposed to say to that question?

32:46.740 --> 32:49.163
That's the question I open with.

32:50.024 --> 32:53.768
My answer is, I wish I knew.

32:54.372 --> 33:02.982
My life hasn't changed substantially in that I'm doing anything really different.

33:03.002 --> 33:03.943
I'm still working.

33:04.144 --> 33:07.428
I was writing movies when I was broke.

33:08.309 --> 33:10.011
I was writing novels when I was broke.

33:10.051 --> 33:11.913
I was writing journalism when I was broke.

33:12.714 --> 33:14.777
I was teaching when I was broke.

33:16.038 --> 33:21.445
I'm still doing all those things, except I'm on a leave from teaching.

33:21.465 --> 33:21.865
I'm...

33:23.768 --> 33:27.173
I'm still living in the same place, the same friends, the same family.

33:27.374 --> 33:31.701
The one thing is that I do travel a lot more now.

33:31.721 --> 33:32.582
I'm going to New York more.

33:32.602 --> 33:34.385
I'm going to Europe more.

33:34.405 --> 33:37.009
Because all the books are coming out over there.

33:37.129 --> 33:41.476
The books are coming out in seven countries.

33:41.496 --> 33:46.063
And more next year.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.587
I think that's about it.

33:48.607 --> 33:51.632
The other thing was the...

33:51.865 --> 34:06.479
We inaugurated the Writers' Institute in April, and he was our inaugural visitor, and he came and spoke to students, read some of his work with Q&A.

34:06.499 --> 34:09.807
Is he rightly credited, though, with getting Ironweed published?

34:10.951 --> 34:34.883
absolutely i mean without his letter i don't know what it took muscle in other words well what he did he wrote the letter which is pretty well known now he said it was a disgrace a book like billy phelan was the uh they would let it go out of print and he had not read ironweed at that time

34:36.837 --> 34:39.822
And that they would let a writer like me go.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.226
He just was very nice.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.850
I hadn't seen him in 20 years.

34:45.491 --> 34:49.918
But he had just finished reading Billy Phelan just before we met.

34:49.938 --> 34:53.985
I was doing a piece on him for Esquire.

34:56.362 --> 35:00.648
And he sat down and volunteered that letter.

35:02.130 --> 35:12.586
Clark Smith was my editor, and he just called me up the next day and said, what do you think if we publish Ironweed in hardcover and bring out Billy and Legg?

35:13.006 --> 35:20.417
What a reversal, I mean, to bring out all the books, not just accept Ironweed, but bring out the two earlier ones.

35:20.437 --> 35:22.420
Well, he had...

35:23.058 --> 35:28.566
The endorsement of Sorrow, which meant a lot to Viking.

35:28.586 --> 35:32.351
He had already gone to Harpoon.

35:32.371 --> 35:33.653
So it was just Bellow.

35:33.713 --> 35:37.097
Bellow's Clout and Sorrow Horse.

35:38.820 --> 35:47.792
And it was also Quark having been behind both Billy and Ironweed in the past.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.756
He bought both of those books.

35:50.776 --> 35:52.018
He was the editor.

35:53.517 --> 35:54.918
Oh, he left and came back?

35:55.179 --> 35:58.682
He was only going for three months, but that was long enough to scramble my intention.

35:58.702 --> 36:00.724
They shipped in a new one from Georgia, didn't they?

36:00.744 --> 36:02.306
Well, they didn't ship anybody in.

36:02.386 --> 36:12.556
There was a girl who used to be an editor there part-time or something, and she would go to Georgia, and they would give her work to do on occasion.

36:12.696 --> 36:20.183
George Higgins has had that problem, and it would be considered a definite problem of his last problem, the choice of one of his biggest complaints was that.

36:20.382 --> 36:25.810
I think I had some editor out in Minnesota, some woman.

36:25.830 --> 36:27.533
I don't know if you've read a new George Higgins.

36:27.773 --> 36:28.414
I have.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.517
I like Betty Coyle a lot.

36:30.938 --> 36:31.939
This new one's good.

36:32.099 --> 36:34.884
It's about politics.

36:34.904 --> 36:35.204
It's beautiful.

36:35.224 --> 36:44.698
But this editor, I guess, was so alien to his way of thinking and his way of writing, according to George, that a delayed publication of the book on the social media for a year.

36:44.718 --> 36:45.079
I'm curious.

36:46.140 --> 36:46.801
I know you're busy.

36:46.842 --> 36:48.284
I've taken up quite a bit of your time.

36:48.604 --> 36:49.866
Did you read The Rat on Fire?
