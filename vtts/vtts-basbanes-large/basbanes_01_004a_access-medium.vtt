WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:09.141
Can you just give me your full name, doctor, just so we can have it on the tape?

00:09.161 --> 00:12.005
My name is Henry Bernard Blumberg.

00:12.386 --> 00:13.507
Okay.

00:13.527 --> 00:15.490
And you live in St.

00:15.570 --> 00:15.930
Paul.

00:15.950 --> 00:19.635
Can I ask you a question before we get going?

00:21.157 --> 00:26.064
Some of the court papers have Stephen's name, S-T-E-V-E-N, or S-T-E-P-H-E-N.

00:26.745 --> 00:28.267
That's just a mistake on that part.

00:29.128 --> 00:29.248
Okay.

00:29.268 --> 00:29.709
I'm sorry.

00:29.749 --> 00:31.892
So you were going to start talking and saying something?

00:31.912 --> 00:32.012
Okay.

00:32.515 --> 00:48.258
Stephen is not a family name, incidentally, but his middle name, which is C-A-R-Y, was after my mother, whose name was C-A-R-R-I-E.

00:49.379 --> 00:51.723
And I have a very interesting family.

00:52.664 --> 01:02.218
My grandpa, who was born in Davenport, Iowa in 1967, was an old-fashioned horse trader.

01:03.008 --> 01:07.675
And when I was a little boy, we lived with him.

01:07.695 --> 01:13.483
And Grandpa was a well-known character in the Twin Cities.

01:15.145 --> 01:24.699
And he actually is the father figure for our entire group and we do.

01:24.879 --> 01:28.464
I spent a great deal of my boyhood living with this guy.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.687
He used to, for instance,

01:31.139 --> 01:34.724
Anytime a circus would come within a hundred miles of St.

01:34.784 --> 01:40.753
Paul and Minneapolis, we'd get up at four, go out, live with the circus people for three or four days.

01:41.574 --> 01:42.675
I'd always get sick.

01:43.557 --> 01:49.766
He didn't know when to, what to feed kids, and somehow I'd always get sick.

01:49.786 --> 01:51.308
But Grandpa took me all over.

01:51.348 --> 01:59.239
That's my... You were about to say something upstairs, and I said, Steve,

01:59.624 --> 02:03.609
the kind of insight I'd like that you could share with me.

02:03.629 --> 02:05.512
Do you remember what that was?

02:05.892 --> 02:07.114
I don't know.

02:07.154 --> 02:07.895
There's so much.

02:09.017 --> 02:20.712
I guess, I think you said that Stephen's behavior became peculiar at the age of 15 or something like that.

02:20.812 --> 02:28.703
Well, he was always an unusual youngster, but never a disobedient guy.

02:30.590 --> 02:35.817
And he was always very close to my wife and I as a child.

02:38.902 --> 02:53.482
And we were a little concerned about his cleanliness.

02:53.502 --> 02:55.024
He didn't, it didn't seem to us.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.566
He dressed quite right.

02:56.727 --> 02:57.728
Is that an early age?

02:58.298 --> 03:00.141
This is when he was about 14 or 15.

03:01.903 --> 03:07.692
And so I decided to send him to a military academy.

03:07.772 --> 03:13.961
We live out in Shoreview, which is a northern suburb of St.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.463
Paul.

03:15.483 --> 03:17.085
And this St.

03:17.105 --> 03:28.221
Thomas Military Academy was right across the street from where my grandpa lived and where I was brought up, 10 miles from where my home is.

03:29.095 --> 03:31.779
My home was in 1965.

03:32.420 --> 03:39.591
Well, this putting him in St.

03:39.651 --> 03:48.744
Thomas, where they wore uniforms, you know, and dressed, turned out to be a very unfortunate thing to do.

03:49.706 --> 03:57.638
Because Stephen was a stranger there from a part of the city where other St.

03:57.658 --> 03:57.938
Thomas

03:58.272 --> 04:02.797
Catholic kids did not live.

04:03.038 --> 04:08.845
And it turned out that the kids that went to St.

04:08.925 --> 04:14.832
Thomas were very cliquish, depending upon which parish they came from in the city.

04:14.852 --> 04:17.255
Well, Stephen had no parish in the city.

04:17.595 --> 04:19.718
Now, you're not Catholic.

04:19.738 --> 04:23.382
My wife is Catholic.

04:23.442 --> 04:25.545
You're Jewish, right?

04:26.217 --> 04:38.475
I came from a family in which half my grandparents were non-Jews and half were Jews.

04:38.495 --> 04:41.219
So you weren't really practicing Jews at all?

04:41.239 --> 04:47.989
Well, Grandpa was a practicing Jew, and he helped found the

04:49.403 --> 04:50.584
synagogue in St.

04:50.805 --> 04:51.005
Paul.

04:51.105 --> 04:52.407
This is not really relevant.

04:52.487 --> 04:55.871
I just think Steve did mention the Franco block in this town.

04:55.911 --> 04:57.212
They're talking about Jewish.

04:57.533 --> 05:02.479
And I think there was some kind of relation with either your family or the Zimmerman family.

05:02.619 --> 05:08.406
So it's just, I kind of assume that he's talking about Jewish or it's enough to be Jewish.

05:08.426 --> 05:13.872
If you start to get into this thing, you know, it's going to get just... No, it's not necessarily.

05:13.952 --> 05:15.134
It's not even going to do it.

05:15.474 --> 05:15.775
Okay.

05:15.795 --> 05:16.896
That was just a passing question.

05:17.737 --> 05:20.120
I married a Catholic girl.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.501
But you're actually talking about the school.

05:22.082 --> 05:24.565
Yeah, and he didn't have a parish, I guess.

05:24.585 --> 05:29.491
Well, he was, in essence, alone, far from home in this place.

05:30.052 --> 05:35.458
And he was a little bit of a kid, and virtually ignored by the other students.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.302
And very lonely.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.284
If you talk to him about St.

05:40.304 --> 05:47.052
Thomas, it seems as if that's where he first became unhappy.

05:47.403 --> 05:58.474
I had paid an older boy who had an automobile.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.698
He was a senior at the same time.

06:02.718 --> 06:07.382
He was driving back home, but he would either forget or ignore him.

06:07.863 --> 06:11.747
Stephen ended up hitchhiking home every day.

06:11.767 --> 06:12.187
Every day.

06:12.888 --> 06:15.250
Yeah, every day after school he hitchhiked home.

06:15.719 --> 06:19.985
Well, what he'd do, this was the days when we were beginning to build the freeway in St.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.707
Paul, Minneapolis.

06:21.727 --> 06:34.826
So what he'd do is on the way home, he'd see these houses which were vacant and go into them and sit there and look at a lot of them, you know, Victorian in age and so on.

06:34.846 --> 06:37.530
And he'd look around at the different things that were in there.

06:38.171 --> 06:41.355
He was exceedingly observant.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.052
And it isn't just books that he collects.

06:44.152 --> 06:49.898
He collects stained glass windows and doorknobs and all, gosh.

06:49.918 --> 06:51.259
Was he always a collector?

06:51.280 --> 06:51.980
Was he always a collector?

06:52.000 --> 06:57.085
Yeah, he was always a collector, even as a youngster, five or six years old.

07:00.109 --> 07:07.576
He's always been an amazing sort of a youngster individual.

07:07.957 --> 07:10.279
I can remember...

07:11.120 --> 07:39.507
I used to go to a place where they sold 78 records in this town I was practicing in when Stephen was a baby in southern Minnesota, and I'd bring home some of these second-hand—the fellow had jukeboxes, and Stephen, when the records would get older, he'd just sell them for 10 or 15 cents, and I'd go in, I'd buy them, and give some to Stephen.

07:40.634 --> 07:49.865
And after he had about 45 or 50 of them, why, you'd pick one up and you'd say, now, Stephen, what record is this?

07:49.945 --> 07:53.128
And this was when he was four, maybe.

07:53.148 --> 07:55.071
He hadn't learned to read yet.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.834
And he'd be able to tell you the name of every one of those records.

07:58.514 --> 08:02.759
And then he'd monkey around with a paper, you know, where the label was.

08:02.779 --> 08:07.705
And sometimes pick it off and ask him, Stephen, what's the name of this record?

08:08.613 --> 08:09.614
He says, I don't know.

08:09.654 --> 08:11.256
The paper's all picked up.

08:11.276 --> 08:12.778
Well, Stephen couldn't read.

08:14.100 --> 08:18.165
He knew what the record was, but he pretended he didn't.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.749
And this was even when he was very young.

08:24.472 --> 08:26.355
Never did too well in school.

08:26.995 --> 08:29.779
He was a very great kid.

08:29.799 --> 08:30.740
A very great man.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.482
Yeah.

08:33.924 --> 08:35.225
Let's jump ahead.

08:35.245 --> 08:37.388
When this thing happened in March of last year,

08:38.431 --> 08:45.698
Well, I first learned about this in 1988.

08:49.222 --> 08:52.665
Stephen was caught in a library out in California.

08:53.146 --> 08:57.010
Yeah, and he hadn't taken any books, as a matter of fact.

08:57.030 --> 09:08.421
If he had used his head at all, he wouldn't have gotten caught, because he went into this private part of the library.

09:09.700 --> 09:18.135
He was kicked out of it by the janitor, and he thought he left his briefcase in there, which is not the case.

09:18.937 --> 09:23.685
So he went back in to get his briefcase, and they caught him a second time, and then they called the briefcase.

09:23.705 --> 09:25.128
That's when the whole thing started.

09:25.949 --> 09:34.324
He didn't have any books, you know, but that's when I kind of... So when they called the FBI in on the picture, and after...

09:34.675 --> 09:50.679
A month or six weeks or two months later, the FBI agent, one of the FBI agents in Minneapolis, started paying me visits asking me if he couldn't make arrangements through me to talk to Smith.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.966
So I went to God, my lawyer, and I said, what should I do about this?

09:54.986 --> 09:56.228
He said, don't do anything.

09:56.248 --> 10:00.514
You tell the guy to contact me, which I did.

10:00.916 --> 10:12.109
The guy spent two years trying to get me and her Dobney to make these arrangements, and I don't know what it wouldn't have been the best thing to do because it wouldn't have been all his friends.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.372
Well, I'm not so sure.

10:14.412 --> 10:16.014
Neither is Dobney.

10:16.034 --> 10:20.819
I mean, with the magnitude of the thing, the magnitude of the thing speaks itself.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.161
I mean, it's still enormous.

10:25.405 --> 10:27.227
You sit down and remember what you said upstairs.

10:28.085 --> 10:32.469
I guess you said that you weren't going to attend any trial.

10:32.489 --> 10:33.610
No, I'm not going to attend any trial.

10:33.650 --> 10:34.891
Why is that?

10:34.911 --> 10:42.478
Well, for one thing, Dr. Logan has advised Gray that there's going to be great criticism of him.

10:45.681 --> 10:55.190
Somehow, and it may be true, somehow my influence on Stephen has had something to do with his development.

10:55.210 --> 10:55.910
Do you believe that?

10:56.151 --> 10:56.691
Psychosis?

10:56.975 --> 10:58.196
What's your position?

10:58.937 --> 11:16.719
Well, I'm not, you know, I've been confronted with this thing off and on for 25 years, and I'm not a rationalizer.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.801
I just don't know.

11:20.724 --> 11:23.947
I don't know what to think.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.070
Do you generally believe in me?

11:26.624 --> 11:29.788
It means medical help.

11:29.808 --> 11:30.348
Oh, there's no question.

11:30.368 --> 11:33.472
I mean, they say this is a valid defense in your population.

11:34.093 --> 11:42.202
It's so valid that I suggested it before anybody down here thought of it.

11:42.222 --> 11:48.829
I convinced it was quite severe.

11:48.950 --> 11:51.953
There you get into the problem of who is normal, you know.

11:52.594 --> 11:56.378
If you dig down deep enough in any of us, you're going to find some

11:56.527 --> 12:09.445
But I have a family, many of whom have had psychiatric difficulties.

12:09.985 --> 12:21.881
So there's a history throughout the family of schizophrenic, antidepressants.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.525
And incidentally, I have two sisters who died of

12:26.395 --> 12:28.518
Encephalitis.

12:28.538 --> 12:32.042
I'm not so sure that is.

12:32.102 --> 12:34.124
How about encephalitis?

12:34.144 --> 12:35.386
Did you get that from an insect?

12:35.466 --> 12:35.706
No.

12:36.287 --> 12:39.891
Well, some forms of encephalitis you get from insects.

12:39.911 --> 12:45.178
Some you get from after the influenza.

12:45.198 --> 12:51.145
The influenza epidemic of World War I produced a great deal of encephalitis.

12:52.466 --> 12:55.390
Interestingly enough, I had a sister who was two years

12:55.741 --> 12:57.804
younger than I was.

12:57.824 --> 13:13.186
When I was six and she was four, they vaccinated the family for smallpox, and she died three days later of, apparently, vaccinia, encephalitis.

13:14.027 --> 13:21.478
Encephalitis due to the virus that they vaccinate people for to prevent smallpox.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.444
You know what has really impressed me

13:26.116 --> 13:36.752
It's surprising, but I think that's what they blame me for.

13:39.537 --> 13:42.581
And I don't see it that way.

13:42.661 --> 13:44.745
I mean, who's they?

13:44.765 --> 13:45.686
The psychiatry.

13:45.766 --> 13:46.728
Some psychiatry.

13:47.349 --> 13:50.113
I blame you for what?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.755
For making Stephen abnormal again.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.638
How can that be?

13:53.658 --> 13:54.199
I don't know.

13:55.023 --> 14:14.964
If I'd have thought it was true, there was even a psychologist once who told me, and this was many years ago in 1966, he said, you should leave your family, go out to California, start a new life for yourself, and stop hurting you.

14:15.004 --> 14:17.687
This was said to you?

14:17.707 --> 14:17.827
Yeah.

14:17.927 --> 14:18.087
When?

14:18.107 --> 14:18.448
1966.

14:18.468 --> 14:18.668
Really?

14:20.268 --> 14:22.350
Now, what prompted the psychiatry?

14:22.450 --> 14:25.312
I mean, were members of your family being treated at that time?

14:26.473 --> 14:28.395
No, my immediate family.

14:28.895 --> 14:31.638
Well, what would prompt the man to say something like that?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.982
Was he seeing any members of the family?

14:37.482 --> 14:40.705
Well, we were dragged in.

14:42.266 --> 14:50.173
See, the beginning of Stephen's court problems was instigated by me, unfortunately.

14:51.672 --> 14:55.077
Stephen stopped in 1965.

14:55.097 --> 14:56.940
He started not coming home for dinner.

14:57.881 --> 14:58.683
This worried me.

14:59.664 --> 15:03.390
Now, this is 26 years ago, so he would have been 16.

15:03.430 --> 15:04.451
Yeah, 16.

15:06.154 --> 15:18.152
And my mother had two detectives who used to alternate, driving her up to Moose Lake,

15:18.554 --> 15:33.031
which is about 100 miles north of the Twin Cities, because I had a second sister who also developed encephalitis, and she developed it after influenza.

15:33.051 --> 15:36.715
She was seven years younger than me.

15:36.735 --> 15:48.308
She was born only after the other girl had died, but she was an invalid all her life, and she died at the age of 42 in 1969.

15:48.828 --> 15:59.144
These two detectives used to drive my mother up there, and they almost became sort of family members, you know.

15:59.164 --> 16:13.165
Well, when Stephen started not showing up at my day for dinner, I got a bit worried about it, and he began to be sloppier than he had previously been, and some strange

16:14.242 --> 16:29.961
looking things about him, and then one day we get a call at the house from a, obviously a black man, asking to receive it, using an assumed name, and then a letter came from the county jail.

16:31.423 --> 16:41.515
Well, the two detectives checked who the letter had come from, and it came from a fellow by the name of Cy Lewis, a black guy, who incidentally I, I,

16:42.794 --> 16:49.524
developed an acquaintance with the following fall and still known.

16:50.926 --> 16:59.359
But he was a sort of a half-baked fence and feet and so on.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.483
He really wasn't much of a criminal.

17:03.786 --> 17:10.877
But at the recommendations of these two cops, I took Stephen down to the

17:12.123 --> 17:16.067
juvenile detention center and put him into it.

17:16.587 --> 17:28.979
And the next day I went down to the juvenile court, and this guy who was the chief deputy for the judge asked me, what should we say we're arresting him for, Doc?

17:30.040 --> 17:30.781
I said, I don't know.

17:30.801 --> 17:31.762
What would you recommend?

17:31.882 --> 17:33.804
Oh, he said, let's call it incorrigibility.

17:35.365 --> 17:38.468
Well, they gave him a very thorough examination.

17:38.735 --> 17:43.460
at that time at the Human Detention Center and came up with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.361
Really?

17:44.421 --> 17:45.923
This is in 65.

17:46.163 --> 17:47.124
In 65.

17:48.185 --> 18:08.387
And this required this judge, unfortunately, because of my family background in the Twin Cities, there's a lot of people who are the children of people who knew my grandpa, including this judge.

18:08.772 --> 18:15.459
We almost got him down here to testify for Stephen, which he would have done.

18:15.700 --> 18:25.811
But Rosenberg, this older attorney, decided he didn't feel they wanted to bother him or something.

18:25.831 --> 18:28.234
At the last minute, he told him he didn't have to come.

18:28.254 --> 18:37.564
But he insisted that Stephen be sent to some sort of a school in the eastern part of the United States

18:38.692 --> 18:40.814
or someplace outside the state.

18:41.916 --> 18:51.666
And he was talking about if there's some schools that disturb young people called the Devereaux schools.

18:51.746 --> 18:53.728
Have you heard of that?

18:53.748 --> 18:55.190
It's very vaguely familiar.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.894
Well, at any rate, that's what they were looking at.

19:00.095 --> 19:07.163
But unfortunately, after having applied for five or six of these places,

19:08.172 --> 19:12.157
None of them were taken because they considered them too old for their programs.

19:13.578 --> 19:18.884
So, with the turning down of all them schools, I got a bit desperate.

19:19.104 --> 19:22.448
We'd spent months, three or four months.

19:22.588 --> 19:26.653
Henry Jamin said he wanted another cup of coffee.

19:26.673 --> 19:27.214
Oh, thank you.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.095
Nick, do you want some?

19:28.115 --> 19:29.216
No problem at all.

19:29.316 --> 19:30.678
No problem at all?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.580
Just black folks.

19:32.680 --> 19:37.065
In the juvenile detention center.

19:38.750 --> 19:43.357
The judge, I complained about this because I said he hasn't done anything.

19:43.377 --> 19:47.503
Judge, why should he be in a detention center like this all this time?

19:47.523 --> 19:50.648
He made me keep it in the locked section of a private hospital.

19:50.728 --> 19:51.169
Why?

19:52.350 --> 19:55.916
Because he was afraid that Stephen would get together with this black guy.

19:56.417 --> 19:57.999
But why was he there in the first place?

19:58.019 --> 19:58.840
He hadn't done anything.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.044
Was this supposed to teach him something?

20:01.064 --> 20:07.093
Well, the judge was just afraid he was going to get to... Why was he in a detention center in the first place?

20:07.153 --> 20:08.014
Because I put him there.

20:08.872 --> 20:11.315
But this was to teach him a lesson?

20:11.395 --> 20:13.238
No, it wasn't punishment, you see.

20:13.999 --> 20:24.352
Juvenile judges, especially this guy, have a tendency to look at all juvenile offenders as sick people.

20:24.372 --> 20:35.606
Well, in Stephen's case, the psychiatrist advised that, yes, Stephen was sick.

20:36.407 --> 20:38.710
Well, the judge is only...

20:39.533 --> 20:45.619
concept of how to work with this thing was to keep him locked up so that he wouldn't gravitate to this.

20:45.639 --> 20:46.339
That's terrible.

20:47.000 --> 21:02.334
And you know, after something like four or five months of this stuff, when they finally let him out, in the interim during that summer, I had taken him to the manager clinic.

21:02.354 --> 21:06.458
So he had a thorough workup at the manager clinic in 1965.

21:06.958 --> 21:09.000
They said, too, that he was said,

21:09.672 --> 21:12.936
Schizoid-like or schizophrenia.

21:13.316 --> 21:14.077
What do they say now?

21:14.097 --> 21:16.039
Is that basically the same?

21:16.120 --> 21:17.581
Much the same.

21:17.601 --> 21:22.187
Yeah, they call him a schizophrenic or a schizoid or something like that.

21:22.207 --> 21:35.342
So when he finally took off and started going on the road, did you have any idea that he was traveling the country, going from city to city and place to place?

21:37.027 --> 21:41.552
During his absences when he was on the road.

21:41.572 --> 21:53.706
Well, there was a period there before he had a car, you see.

21:53.726 --> 21:59.713
And he'd go down to the Skid Row areas of Minneapolis, particularly in southern St.

21:59.733 --> 22:01.275
Paul.

22:01.295 --> 22:03.698
Made friends there.

22:03.718 --> 22:05.380
I got pretty adept at

22:06.440 --> 22:09.324
getting down to these places myself, you see.

22:10.025 --> 22:13.409
I'd make friends with the indigent down there.

22:14.671 --> 22:19.017
I've been a kind of, as you can see, a kind of a mother hymn.

22:20.338 --> 22:27.288
And I almost had to do it alone because my wife is not equipped for that sort of thing.

22:27.308 --> 22:32.194
And I get lies among me, among me,

22:34.013 --> 22:35.555
drunks and so on, you know.

22:35.595 --> 22:42.125
Some of them became really close friends with not only Stephen, but me in those early years.

22:42.145 --> 22:45.830
So this is not something you've just begun to do in recent years.

22:45.850 --> 22:46.070
No.

22:46.811 --> 22:50.076
You're finding these people from the other side.

22:50.176 --> 22:51.919
Yeah.

22:51.939 --> 22:55.784
And he'd bring me down because they'd get, some of them would get sick.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.588
So he'd bring me down to see them.

22:58.648 --> 22:59.409
He was worried.

22:59.529 --> 23:02.113
So here his father, the doctor, would come down and take him.

23:02.363 --> 23:04.506
What is your specialty, by the way?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.970
Internal medicine.

23:06.990 --> 23:22.373
Internal medicine, but I've been one of the pioneers in geriatric care in Minnesota for something like seven or eight years.

23:22.393 --> 23:26.059
I was the chairman of the Aging Committee for the State Medical Association.

23:27.305 --> 23:35.055
And I got interested in nursing home care and other problems with me at the elderly.

23:37.479 --> 23:40.943
This must be a tough thing to deal with.

23:40.963 --> 23:56.244
I mean, all this publicity and other... I'm beyond caring about that too much, but it's tough to deal with because it's so agonizing to see your son this way.

23:56.424 --> 23:57.025
Where do you think

23:57.410 --> 24:02.156
The books seem to be a special interest apart from... They do.

24:03.098 --> 24:12.029
Do you have an explanation for that in your mind as to why the books particularly?

24:12.310 --> 24:15.975
What made them the passion among passions?

24:15.995 --> 24:25.948
Well, this kid would...

24:26.468 --> 24:36.200
travel around the country, and he'd get a feeling in depth of the different towns that he went to.

24:36.221 --> 24:45.252
And he was just all over the place before he was 21, usually by himself and usually in an old clunker that he'd buy.

24:47.074 --> 24:55.345
And he'd draw pictures of the old houses, the Victorian houses.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.358
especially the Victorian, but any old house.

25:00.340 --> 25:14.399
And one day, he decided that he was going to take some of these pictures and send them into... There's an institution in Washington called the National Trust for Historic Preservation of the United States.

25:14.419 --> 25:20.527
Well, he sent in some of his pictures to this thing, pictures of the old buildings.

25:21.649 --> 25:24.893
And the editor of their quarterly journal,

25:25.548 --> 25:29.953
wrote a letter back saying, Stephen, we'd like to reproduce these.

25:29.973 --> 25:35.260
And they wrote an article entitled The Victorian World of Stephen Blumberg around these things.

25:35.340 --> 25:37.182
Where was this present?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.924
I wouldn't mind just getting a copy of that.

25:38.964 --> 25:46.534
The National Trust of Historic Preservation is in Washington, D.C.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.760
And I have a couple of copies.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.103
I gave one to Nickerson.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.973
Do you know offhand when it was published?

25:59.313 --> 26:01.777
It seemed to me that it was 1972.

26:02.237 --> 26:03.259
Mm-hmm.

26:03.279 --> 26:06.103
And the other piece was The Victorian World of Stephen's Own World?

26:06.123 --> 26:06.323
Yeah.

26:07.665 --> 26:09.368
And that was in their periodical, right?

26:09.388 --> 26:11.130
Yeah.

26:11.150 --> 26:17.139
I mean, does he see himself as lost in a Victorian world, or is the Senator suggesting that?

26:17.319 --> 26:24.850
Not so much lost in a Victorian world as the savior of the Victorian world.

26:25.083 --> 26:30.430
He deplored the fact that these houses, first in St.

26:30.570 --> 26:43.748
Paul and Minneapolis, but then all over the country in the 70s, were being knocked down by a, you know, they take a great big steel ball and just knock the houses to smithereens and everything that was in it was lost.

26:44.770 --> 26:52.480
And he felt this was just an appalling thing, these beautiful things that he saw in the houses, these stained glass windows and so on.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.942
So he felt that

26:54.327 --> 26:58.852
He needed to collect these things in order to save them for posterity.

26:59.713 --> 27:08.184
This was before the book thing got into the, but he got into the book thing, because he got interested in these towns, you see.

27:08.204 --> 27:10.646
Yeah, he was looking for, I guess, for research material.

27:10.747 --> 27:23.642
Yeah, and he collected books on architecture, Victorian architecture.

27:24.061 --> 27:30.728
He collected books on the towns themselves, and in the late 70s, I used to go with him.

27:31.809 --> 27:35.733
I figured he didn't, he usually didn't want me to go with him in those days.

27:35.833 --> 27:37.835
Now, he feels a lot closer to me.

27:38.696 --> 27:41.699
He wants me with him, but in those early days, he didn't.

27:41.719 --> 27:51.469
He thought it was kind of a sissy thing for him to be with his father, so I kind of had to push him to go with him.

27:52.613 --> 27:58.059
He took me once to Philadelphia, and there's an individual.

27:58.839 --> 28:01.102
I don't know whether he still has the job.

28:01.122 --> 28:11.793
This would be about 19, oh my God, this is 1972 also, 71.

28:13.074 --> 28:18.199
There's a fellow by the name of Maas, M-A-A-S-S.

28:19.833 --> 28:30.625
was an authority on Victorian architecture and was the architectural historian for the city of Philadelphia.

28:31.727 --> 28:43.640
And we went to see this guy, Moss, and he wrote a book called The Gingerbread Age that Stephen had bought, and Stephen had started to correspond with him.

28:43.660 --> 28:49.587
And I can remember we had lunch with him.

28:50.393 --> 28:54.857
Stephen's drawings, and I asked him, I said, what do you think of these drawings?

28:55.958 --> 29:01.803
And Ma says, well, that's just the way I started out.

29:01.823 --> 29:11.612
The kid has got the potential for being, and if you spend the time out of it and have the desire, he could be really quite an artist.

29:11.632 --> 29:14.775
Well, I asked him yesterday, you know, I said, no, you're still a young man.

29:15.716 --> 29:20.400
Regardless how this thing comes out, win or lose, I said, you know,

29:20.954 --> 29:23.476
Well, hopefully, you'll be rehabilitated.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.478
You've still got a life ahead of you, you know?

29:25.498 --> 29:32.024
I mean, have you ever thought of being an architect, or, you know?

29:32.044 --> 29:42.594
And he didn't really respond to that, but it would be nice to know what his goals are when this is over, and I don't know if they are, you know, at the moment.

29:42.614 --> 29:50.742
He needs a role model, I think, and I'm so different.

29:51.464 --> 29:54.548
you know, a plotting, scientific mind.

29:54.568 --> 29:56.812
That's why I got into medical school.

29:57.753 --> 30:04.883
They look for obsessive, compulsive people like me in the medical aptitude tests.

30:05.023 --> 30:18.282
They're designed to catch people who are plotters, look for the minutiae to remember, and

30:19.510 --> 30:22.233
I tend to memorize things, I think.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.316
But you say you're compulsive in another way?

30:25.376 --> 30:28.639
I mean, do you think this is something he acquired from you?

30:29.440 --> 30:31.622
Well, I'm certainly compulsive.

30:31.662 --> 30:40.772
I think all internists, I've heard some of my psychiatrist friends tell me that all internists are obsessive compulsive people.

30:41.593 --> 30:47.779
But I'm not at all compulsive like he is.

30:48.350 --> 30:49.351
my associates.

30:51.214 --> 30:55.579
Yes, I haven't been in practice in fifteen years, but— Why haven't you?

30:55.899 --> 30:56.260
No.

30:57.862 --> 31:13.581
This grandfather of mine left an unbelievably complicated estate of real estate holdings.

31:14.978 --> 31:18.563
all over the place and all kinds of stuff.

31:18.583 --> 31:24.713
And around about 1975, all of a sudden, enough of this became valuable.

31:26.235 --> 31:29.440
So that I... Well, it required your attention.

31:29.700 --> 31:35.669
To be honest, the real reason I quit practice was Stephen.

31:35.689 --> 31:42.920
I... He'd get into minor problems just all over the place.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.462
He'd be caught in old buildings.

31:45.455 --> 31:50.981
and the little things that happened here and there.

31:51.081 --> 31:56.167
I just didn't feel right about what I was doing to the patients.

31:56.187 --> 31:57.789
So I retired from practice.

31:57.909 --> 32:01.353
I didn't need to practice because of the real estate.

32:01.693 --> 32:03.695
So there was another source of income.

32:04.816 --> 32:05.017
Yeah.

32:05.037 --> 32:06.859
Did you feel helpless at all, Stephen?

32:06.879 --> 32:09.842
I mean, was there a sense of...

32:12.117 --> 32:14.199
helplessness, I guess.

32:14.259 --> 32:20.185
Paddling for all I was worth just to keep my nose above water for years.

32:21.286 --> 32:21.787
Agony.

32:22.647 --> 32:24.469
I don't know how I'd survive.

32:24.489 --> 32:25.430
Sometimes I wonder.

32:27.512 --> 32:32.557
Something like this then was not totally unexpected then.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.659
You mean this last thing?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.602
The circumstance he finds himself in now.

32:37.903 --> 32:40.285
Well, he had never

32:41.142 --> 32:48.633
which was really criminal up to this.

32:49.654 --> 32:50.776
And I was not aware of it.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.720
I mean, it was ongoing for 20 years, apparently.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.866
Yeah, but this was going into old, abandoned houses.

32:57.886 --> 33:00.530
No, I mean that, but I mean the books, apparently.

33:00.550 --> 33:01.772
Yeah, and I didn't know.

33:01.812 --> 33:04.716
See, he'd buy a lot of books.

33:04.736 --> 33:07.200
Of these 20,000 books,

33:08.902 --> 33:12.826
Probably 19,000 he purchased.

33:12.846 --> 33:14.007
Well, that's what he said.

33:14.027 --> 33:15.048
He indicated yesterday.

33:15.068 --> 33:17.230
He said, you know, a lot of reason mine.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.352
They're genuinely mine, he said.

33:19.832 --> 33:38.790
The thing that most people, I don't think, realize is that virtually every estate sale, the Salvation Army, the libraries have bargain sales all the time, and what most people pick up

33:39.158 --> 33:40.720
not the real old stuff.

33:41.802 --> 33:45.127
And so you can pick up books for practically nothing anyplace.

33:45.247 --> 33:47.190
And it continues to this day.

33:47.210 --> 33:53.479
I guess, you know, one element is that Stephen has had needs, you know, at the barest minimum.

33:53.899 --> 33:54.901
Isn't that something, though?

33:57.444 --> 34:05.556
You know, and I don't want to estimate how much he has had access to, but I mean, it's been estimated anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 a year.

34:05.656 --> 34:07.579
Well, see, my...

34:08.335 --> 34:16.605
My mother, when she died, left three trusts—one for me, one for my brother, one for my sister.

34:16.625 --> 34:21.752
I took my share of the trust because I didn't need it.

34:21.772 --> 34:25.456
Every year, I'd give half of it to Stephen and half of it to my daughter.

34:26.818 --> 34:33.386
And then, on top of that, we had a—we had and have an apartment complex in St.

34:33.646 --> 34:38.292
Paul that my brother and sister and I built.

34:40.010 --> 34:53.589
My brother has a son who's an attorney down in Houston, Texas, and he said, you ought to put that into a limited partnership and give it to us kids, and we did that.

34:53.809 --> 34:56.573
I gave my share to Stephen and my daughter.

34:57.314 --> 35:06.687
So he comes from the apartment house and he gets the app of my share of my mother's.

35:06.707 --> 35:08.970
What would you estimate?

35:09.110 --> 35:09.831
It's $70,000.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.718
Does he use it every year?

35:13.738 --> 35:20.387
He spends it all on whatever he buys, you know.

35:20.507 --> 35:21.509
I mean, not on clothing.

35:22.110 --> 35:23.992
Oh, hell, he doesn't eat.

35:24.613 --> 35:37.371
I, I, I, for the past 10 years, 15 years, I've had him bring in all the receipts when he's on the road.

35:38.279 --> 35:42.265
so that I could make out an income tax for him and report his sales and so on.

35:43.627 --> 35:48.615
And he'd go to flea markets and he'd sell this junk that he's collected over the past 25 years.

35:50.357 --> 36:00.292
And I'd keep all these records and then I'd put them in a book chronologically.

36:01.173 --> 36:05.620
I could pretty well tell by the receipts, you see,

36:06.038 --> 36:08.801
how much he was spending for food and it was pitiful.

36:10.123 --> 36:14.348
He was spending less for food in a week than an ordinary person would spend in a day.

36:14.969 --> 36:21.997
I don't know, I think he ate mostly junk food and candy bars.

36:22.017 --> 36:28.445
Whatever, you know, we had two meals together yesterday.

36:28.465 --> 36:34.212
You know, we had an old meal, which is not much.

36:34.232 --> 36:34.392
Yeah.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.247
and he really seeks out.

36:37.347 --> 36:42.732
The most fruitful place that you can occupy.

36:42.752 --> 36:42.852
Yeah.

36:44.013 --> 36:46.295
The likable guy.

36:46.555 --> 36:48.817
Tell me about your perfection for him.

36:49.258 --> 37:03.130
Oh, I have, I don't know, my, I almost adore both him and my daughter, and I think he,

37:04.510 --> 37:06.792
The adoration is reciprocated.

37:09.095 --> 37:13.700
If you'd ask either one of them, I think they'd tell you that.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.782
They just idolize me, and I don't know why.

37:19.125 --> 37:23.750
People who are close to me, I guess, do tend to be that way.

37:23.770 --> 37:28.815
I have some kind of effect where people who don't know me don't like me, and people who do know me.

37:29.176 --> 37:31.578
Well, where did this other person come up with this?

37:31.778 --> 37:34.281
I was suggesting we should go to California and it's about over.

37:34.632 --> 37:51.316
Well, the psychiatrists have some... See, this would never be if it were a psychiatrist who was a friend of mine, and some psychiatrists who were friends of mine have taken care of Stephen.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.099
There would never be any criticism of him.

37:54.461 --> 38:04.335
But psychiatrists who didn't know me, and through the court mess, when he got into the hands of some of these

38:05.817 --> 38:08.099
They were just criticized the hell out of me.

38:09.361 --> 38:22.834
And I don't know, it may be that I was, I had a great deal of guilt feeling about this originally, putting him in that juvenile intentional mess.

38:22.854 --> 38:25.958
I thought, my God, what have you done to your son, you know?

38:26.438 --> 38:32.845
And I think I was very defensive in 1965 and 1966, and that may have had something to do.

38:32.865 --> 38:35.267
You think maybe that was an act of frustration in your part?

38:36.344 --> 38:37.305
to put him in there.

38:38.006 --> 38:53.122
I was simply taking the advice of these two guys who I knew very well, and I thought they knew what they were talking about, but I didn't realize that the upshot would be what it was.

38:53.142 --> 38:59.108
What, to your mind, is the greatest tragedy about this?

38:59.669 --> 39:00.730
Is there one?

39:00.750 --> 39:03.313
In Stephen?

39:04.222 --> 39:32.119
Oh, I think that, uh, to me, uh, the pain that this has inflicted on my wife, myself, uh,

39:32.825 --> 39:45.400
to a lesser degree, perhaps, to these kids and so on, is something that I look at with a great deal of sadness.

39:45.420 --> 40:01.178
It's been terrible for me, but I no longer feel any guilt about it because I didn't know anything about the book situation.

40:01.647 --> 40:06.795
the library security.

40:06.955 --> 40:08.497
He came with a complete surprise.

40:08.558 --> 40:10.601
He hit it completely.

40:11.382 --> 40:15.889
So, I mean, I was in the warehouse down in a tunnel yesterday.

40:15.909 --> 40:20.416
That's an enormous silver thing that you can't believe.

40:22.519 --> 40:22.819
Really?

40:23.040 --> 40:25.804
And this is just a fraction I make at this time.

40:25.864 --> 40:26.625
Yeah, he's got...

40:27.162 --> 40:31.285
two places up in the cities like that.

40:31.366 --> 40:34.608
That hasn't got so much in it.

40:36.210 --> 40:36.390
Yeah.

40:36.410 --> 40:38.832
He had a fascination for Texas, I guess.

40:39.312 --> 40:52.944
Well, that's where the market for... Yeah, you see, they didn't have enough of a history down there to have these things, and we'd go all that distance, and stuff that was humdrum up in St.

40:53.104 --> 40:56.747
Paul and Indianapolis with the collector's items down there.

40:57.014 --> 41:02.960
Then he'd sell them usually for half of what most people got for them down there.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.822
Most of his customers were antique dealers.

41:05.842 --> 41:11.568
Did you think he had a pretty good dinner store?

41:11.648 --> 41:12.889
I mean, did he do all right?

41:12.949 --> 41:14.190
Did he make money out of it, you think?

41:14.491 --> 41:26.582
Well, he'd collect about $25,000, $30,000, but he'd spend it on the cost of storage,

41:26.883 --> 41:36.553
and automobile breakdowns and what have you, and pretty much eat up whatever you need.

41:36.573 --> 41:41.218
Plus the fact that he'd take this money that he'd get.

41:42.239 --> 41:47.905
I'd kept his bank accounts for him.

41:47.925 --> 41:50.308
Did he just issue checks out of the account?

41:50.328 --> 41:52.570
How did he get the money?

41:53.123 --> 41:57.770
When he'd be, when he'd be up in Minneapolis where he'd go to the bank and cash a check.

41:59.032 --> 42:01.435
But a lot of times I'd send him the money.

42:01.535 --> 42:02.797
Why are there money down?

42:03.398 --> 42:05.321
I think he would call and ask him to do it.

42:05.441 --> 42:09.907
Henry, I mean, Fort Worth, please send me $1,500.

42:11.530 --> 42:14.534
So he really never needed for money.

42:15.475 --> 42:20.563
How long has he had access to this trust?

42:20.583 --> 42:20.683
Well,

42:21.254 --> 42:26.523
I started giving it to him in 1976.

42:31.732 --> 42:42.350
So, if this defense is successful, what will happen?

42:42.370 --> 42:45.355
Well, I think that what will happen is this.

42:47.596 --> 42:54.987
If I knew more about courts, especially federal courts, I could tell better.

42:55.448 --> 43:05.584
But what I've been looking for, and I have, you know, medical colleagues here, there, in every place.

43:05.604 --> 43:11.152
I have, for instance, a close friend who's on the staff at the Mayo Clinic.

43:12.374 --> 43:14.397
And I have...

43:14.967 --> 43:29.843
The son of my medical school closest friend who was long dead is the chief psychiatrist at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington.

43:30.764 --> 43:33.147
So I've been kind of feeling these fellows out.

43:33.307 --> 43:39.574
What do you think we could find for Stephen and this Dr. Logan as well?

43:40.955 --> 43:43.438
If we get to this point where we know we can do it,

43:44.161 --> 44:05.383
My idea would be that he should be put into an environment where he has psychiatric care and at the same time can get his life in shape.

44:06.424 --> 44:13.712
I mean, you expect that he would have to be committed to something like that, and this wouldn't be where he'd be able to come at all.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.383
I suspect he'll be committed for it.

44:17.905 --> 44:25.255
I talk to my psychiatric friends, and I get a lot of different estimates, but I suspect that they won't keep him very long.

44:25.275 --> 44:27.498
Really?

44:27.518 --> 44:27.618
Yeah.

44:27.638 --> 44:32.925
I mean, I would hope that, you know, he doesn't go and resume this activity then.

44:33.306 --> 44:41.016
Well, the thing is, he needs to be in a set environment in which he works with people.

44:42.278 --> 45:00.435
One of the things I've been thinking is if he could get in there is there was some fellow that raised him contacting who was a head of a librarian's security facilities.

45:00.615 --> 45:11.745
And if he could get in with this guy, help him with taking care of the libraries

45:12.063 --> 45:26.822
using his understanding of what's wrong with their security system, helping him fix it up, and at the same time see a private psychiatrist on the outside.

45:26.882 --> 45:28.584
That would be my idea.

45:28.604 --> 45:39.117
And I would think on a worst case, if he's convicted, it would be worth requesting the court to have him assign the task of helping

45:40.565 --> 45:43.088
find the places where these things belong.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.729
You know what I'm saying?

45:44.769 --> 45:47.352
He knows where every book came from.

45:47.372 --> 45:48.653
Yeah, he should do that, too.

45:49.034 --> 45:51.376
He'd like to do that.

45:51.396 --> 45:53.178
He'd like to do that.

45:54.159 --> 45:58.904
The thing is, Stephen wouldn't steal a penny from somebody new.

45:58.924 --> 45:59.725
I've seen him.

46:00.986 --> 46:08.614
He's one day found an envelope in this building in Minneapolis where he has his stuff.

46:10.079 --> 46:12.602
In the same block, there was the headquarters.

46:12.843 --> 46:23.616
We had the DFL party up to the Democratic primary labor party, and they had their state offices at that time in one of the buildings in the block.

46:23.636 --> 46:35.732
And one day, he's going up and down the alley, and he finds an envelope with $500 in cash with the DFL on the envelope.

46:36.826 --> 46:39.269
He goes in and reports it and takes it in.

46:39.369 --> 46:41.992
He's got to put it in his pocket.

46:42.012 --> 46:58.473
The first windows he sold, I took them down to my hospital, and I figured the doctors would get a kind of a kick out of this, so I took two, three, or four of them down and set them up, and a couple of friends of mine said, you know, those are pretty.

46:58.573 --> 47:01.717
I'm doing a house up in this area.

47:03.099 --> 47:05.702
You don't suppose Stephen would mind if I came and bought something?

47:06.020 --> 47:08.664
So he came over, and that was the first windows he sold.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.888
And then another doctor came over.

47:11.908 --> 47:19.298
And the first doctor, his children grew up.

47:19.318 --> 47:23.804
He moved from the big house to a townhouse.

47:23.824 --> 47:25.486
This was about four years ago.

47:26.928 --> 47:31.314
So he wanted more windows from Stephen.

47:31.334 --> 47:34.238
Well, Stephen, who never charged

47:35.872 --> 47:39.336
as much as most people do for windows anyhow.

47:39.356 --> 47:43.601
And many of these he did for 20 years, by the way.

47:43.621 --> 47:57.718
He figured out that he charged Dr. Huesby $75 too much, so he sent six a letter saying, I got $75 too much for everything.

47:58.038 --> 47:58.779
He wouldn't cheat.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.623
Somebody knew about anything.

48:01.643 --> 48:05.187
Just almost... Yeah, he's a gentle kid.

48:05.453 --> 48:06.134
Would you say?

48:06.354 --> 48:06.655
Oh, yeah.

48:07.796 --> 48:15.046
I mean, there are unquestioned elements of warmth in him, too.

48:15.066 --> 48:23.717
But when you said that somebody had diagnosed schizophrenia, what was the other side that they saw?

48:25.420 --> 48:33.891
Well, the way the fellow at the Mayo Clinic, or at the Menager Clinic at that point, described him,

48:34.850 --> 48:44.238
He said he goes into these old places with the cobwebs and the dirt and the dust, and he claims he sees beauty.

48:45.499 --> 48:47.080
He says, no, that's unrealistic.

48:47.221 --> 48:49.402
All there is is dirt and dust.

48:49.422 --> 48:50.243
And cobwebs.

48:50.343 --> 48:53.966
And cobwebs.

48:53.986 --> 48:58.991
And these people that he takes, there's probably an extension of that.

48:59.011 --> 49:04.215
I mean, the house that he took me to yesterday, he just put this around.

49:04.297 --> 49:05.659
I'll run back on again now.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.100
Okay, I'm sorry.

49:07.781 --> 49:26.343
I've been enough around these people from the other side of life, from you and I, to know that there's a tremendous amount of need for affection and even love.

49:26.363 --> 49:27.064
They were nice people.

49:27.445 --> 49:29.167
They were not taking anything away from the people.

49:29.427 --> 49:31.249
They certainly deserved

49:32.984 --> 49:36.588
our compassion, you know.

49:36.608 --> 49:39.232
Anyway, I want to make that clear.

49:39.312 --> 49:41.074
I didn't mean things were bad people at all.

49:41.394 --> 49:45.359
He introduced you to Jimmy Hall down in Otumwet, and what a character.

49:45.860 --> 49:56.613
You know, Jimmy and his wife had a dreadful rooming house in the very worst partisan scenario.

49:56.713 --> 50:01.219
And I don't know how Stephen got there to begin with, but he started

50:02.735 --> 50:07.061
And when he'd go through Cincinnati, he started renting a room up there.

50:08.203 --> 50:18.277
And Jimmy's wife, who was about four or five years older than me, just simply adored Stephen.

50:18.818 --> 50:23.284
She'd call me up about, oh, once a month or something like that.

50:24.185 --> 50:26.869
How is my boy after going there again?

50:27.271 --> 50:40.048
You know, and I'd go there, and he'd take me up to sleep in those rooms, and I smelled of urine, and I'd find an excuse after a night or two of going someplace else.

50:40.548 --> 50:43.092
But... You actually would spend the night?

50:43.352 --> 50:43.973
Oh, sure.

50:44.553 --> 50:46.115
Yeah, I didn't want to hurt their feelings.

50:46.176 --> 50:49.700
They were so... How old was that man, by the way?

50:49.720 --> 50:50.842
Jimmy is 75.

50:50.862 --> 50:54.226
My God, no, my father is 79.

50:54.246 --> 50:56.569
This guy looked like he was at his age.

50:56.903 --> 51:00.087
Well, he's... He's dissipated, I guess.

51:00.107 --> 51:03.011
Well, he drinks too much, yeah.

51:03.091 --> 51:04.993
Well, he's a little squashy, I think, too.

51:05.013 --> 51:07.917
From alcohol, yeah.

51:07.937 --> 51:08.638
But he never did.

51:08.658 --> 51:10.180
He would love that he called him Mr. Hall.

51:10.641 --> 51:13.925
I mean, Mr. Hall doesn't call him Jimmy.

51:13.945 --> 51:14.145
Yeah.

51:15.207 --> 51:24.799
Well, Mrs. Hall called him Jimmy, and she was more intelligent than me, although... He loves it down there.

51:24.959 --> 51:26.421
He thinks he can stay there forever.

51:27.076 --> 51:29.759
Well, it was my idea to move him into that house.

51:29.839 --> 51:32.822
It was my idea for Stephen to buy that house.

51:32.842 --> 51:33.643
Had you ever seen it?

51:33.663 --> 51:35.224
Would it have all the books in it?

51:35.244 --> 51:36.205
Had you ever been down there?

51:36.966 --> 51:39.349
I never went upstairs to look at the books.

51:40.670 --> 51:47.617
He had books up in Minneapolis, but I don't think he had all of them up there.

51:47.637 --> 51:51.261
But you wouldn't have known inculables and inculables?

51:51.629 --> 51:56.794
He wouldn't have known that one of these books may be worth $50,000 or $100,000.

51:57.415 --> 52:05.423
I looked at the books up at Minneapolis before he moved them down there many times, you know.

52:05.883 --> 52:14.512
And what would attract my attention is some book about old Minneapolis or even old Boston or something like that.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.894
Of course, he was able to suspect that he was

52:17.633 --> 52:19.575
making midnight rubs to libraries.

52:19.776 --> 52:22.178
I didn't have any faintest idea about that.

52:22.859 --> 52:27.184
But this guy, Rhodes, now this is an interesting thing.

52:27.204 --> 52:40.099
We knew this guy for 15 years, and I saw Rhodes on several occasions during those 15 years at odd intervals, always up in Minneapolis.

52:40.940 --> 52:45.025
I never traveled anyplace with Rhodes, nor did I go to Detroit ever.

52:46.270 --> 53:03.673
When Rhodes was with me, he'd treat me... You know David Copperfield and this Uriah keeper, that self-effacement of Uriah.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.017
He'd sort of treat me that way.

53:07.298 --> 53:14.488
And almost every conversation I'd have with him, it seems to me, at least as I recall him now,

53:15.447 --> 53:35.744
He'd complain about his back and he claimed he had a dislocated disc in his back and he needed Percodan, which is a strong morphine-like drug, which he'd take, I guess, quite a bit of for his back.

53:35.764 --> 53:45.032
And the conversation usually would center around Kenny and his medical

53:45.333 --> 53:45.854
condition.

53:46.735 --> 53:48.877
And it was always sort of self-effacing.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.220
I never looked at this guy as a criminal at all.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.945
I never saw the, uh, and yet he must be the worst scoundrel that Steve has ever known.

53:56.085 --> 54:05.536
I was about to tell you, I saw him briefly on a tablet, and I didn't finish telling him, but I said, okay, and I said, you know, I'm going to write about you.

54:06.357 --> 54:08.579
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

54:08.720 --> 54:13.585
And I said, you know, I'll be doing the record, so I mean, I can, I said, but, uh,

54:13.835 --> 54:16.619
this is a trick, you know, I mean, it's not a trick, it's a device.

54:16.639 --> 54:21.184
And I said, of course, if you don't talk to me, I said, I'm just going to have to depend on your testimony.

54:21.204 --> 54:26.952
And I said, quite frankly, if that's the case, I said, you look like a pretty bad guy in that testimony.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.355
You look to me straight and I said, I am a bad guy.

54:30.817 --> 54:32.759
I said, I shiver on my spine.

54:32.839 --> 54:35.142
I was looking into the face of evil when he said that.

54:35.963 --> 54:37.325
He said, I am a bad guy.

54:38.747 --> 54:39.808
I said, you know, you've got it right.

54:42.455 --> 54:43.236
See you later.

54:43.256 --> 54:46.881
You know, and I left and I wrote that down.

54:47.442 --> 54:49.645
I will lose that.

54:49.665 --> 54:53.350
He's a contemptible guy.

54:54.191 --> 54:59.158
I'm not trying to excuse in any way what Stephen did.

54:59.678 --> 55:01.200
And I told him that.

55:01.220 --> 55:04.184
I said, Stephen, that's irrelevant.

55:04.345 --> 55:05.867
You know, what you did was wrong.

55:06.568 --> 55:09.171
And I would hope that you never do something like this again.

55:09.191 --> 55:11.575
And you make every effort to rehabilitate yourself.

55:11.855 --> 55:11.955
Yeah.

55:12.307 --> 55:15.672
I said, but that man set you up.

55:15.692 --> 55:16.773
He strung you along.

55:16.933 --> 55:20.639
He came in to sell you out.

55:20.659 --> 55:22.882
What amazes me is that he waited so long.

55:23.603 --> 55:27.829
But then I think he was waiting to make a good score on it.

55:27.969 --> 55:29.711
I guess he saw this as his ace in the hole.

55:30.993 --> 55:35.259
Until the day he needed it, he had somebody he could sell out.

55:35.279 --> 55:37.302
Because apparently he was in trouble for other things.

55:37.720 --> 55:43.627
This guy has a record a mile long and all expunged because he's been a paid informant.

55:43.647 --> 55:46.171
Yeah, a paid informer for 18 years.

55:46.771 --> 55:48.433
For close to $200,000.

55:49.795 --> 55:50.056
Yeah.

55:50.296 --> 55:53.240
He raped Stephen's place down in the tunnel and the thing is empty.

55:53.260 --> 55:53.440
Yeah.

55:55.082 --> 55:58.166
And you can see it when you go to the warehouse, because you couldn't get into the warehouse.

55:58.706 --> 56:00.048
That stuff's all still there.

56:00.389 --> 56:01.210
The house was raped.

56:01.610 --> 56:02.271
There's nothing there.

56:02.391 --> 56:04.013
There's nothing left in that house.

56:04.033 --> 56:05.855
And most of it this guy took.

56:05.915 --> 56:06.476
Took it all.

56:07.037 --> 56:07.137
Yeah.

56:08.348 --> 56:10.090
And the FBI found him.

56:10.150 --> 56:12.493
And he stole $6,000 from Jimmy Hall.

56:13.054 --> 56:14.596
Yeah.

56:14.736 --> 56:17.239
And Jimmy, like a fool, gave him a combination to the same.

56:17.279 --> 56:17.700
No.

56:18.060 --> 56:20.704
It's not funny, I'm sorry.

56:21.084 --> 56:22.787
Kenny could fool you, though.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.851
I thought he was the nicest man I ever met.

56:25.871 --> 56:26.972
He treated me so nice.

56:27.192 --> 56:29.736
Setting him up.

56:32.359 --> 56:33.140
What can I say?

56:33.761 --> 56:36.364
If you see a guy who really looks like a crook,

56:37.222 --> 56:41.889
I liked this Cy Rulish, you know, this black guy at the beginning there.

56:42.610 --> 56:57.511
Cy, at a certain point in time, Stephen was living over with a University of Minnesota student who was studying to be a probation officer.

56:57.531 --> 57:05.322
And this guy got to meet Cy, and then he went and he told us,

57:05.909 --> 57:07.891
prospective boss that he'd met him.

57:07.911 --> 57:11.496
And I got the guy who almost hit the ceiling called me up and told me.

57:12.537 --> 57:16.502
And I decided, well, if they can't keep him away from Cy, maybe I can.

57:17.163 --> 57:20.988
So I had this student bring him over to my office.

57:22.389 --> 57:34.144
And I said, now, Cy, I want you to know that I've been asked to prefer charges against you, but I wouldn't do it.

57:34.462 --> 57:38.506
Because in all honesty, I could not see that you've done anything to Steve.

57:38.826 --> 57:40.148
But here's what I want you to do.

57:40.168 --> 57:44.212
I want you to protect Steve.

57:45.833 --> 57:50.678
Instead of doing him harm, you protect him, and you protect him by keeping in contact with me.

57:51.399 --> 57:53.301
This guy never let me down.

57:54.382 --> 58:02.950
He looks like, you know, a shiftless stare, but he's got honor.

58:04.111 --> 58:06.014
Three years ago, he had a heart attack.

58:06.415 --> 58:08.538
Took him down to the city hospital.

58:09.399 --> 58:11.843
So I wouldn't let him touch him until he called me.

58:13.425 --> 58:15.549
This guy, you can trust, you see.

58:16.831 --> 58:18.293
He looks like a crook, this kid.

58:18.313 --> 58:20.476
It's been an education for you, hasn't it?

58:20.556 --> 58:21.037
Oh, man.

58:21.077 --> 58:22.600
Such as you never would have expected.

58:22.800 --> 58:23.301
Oh, yeah.

58:24.442 --> 58:26.145
Have you got a reflection on that?

58:28.409 --> 58:31.333
Well, I've been through so much, you know, after all.

58:32.697 --> 58:44.954
42 months, I was a front-line doctor in both the South Pacific and under general patent for the European Union.

58:44.974 --> 58:51.883
I saw a lot of—there's guys I still know that I picked up where they got hit.

58:55.688 --> 59:02.097
And doctoring you meet an awful lot of different types of people.

59:02.566 --> 59:07.191
especially in your residencies and internships and so on.

59:07.212 --> 59:13.859
So I've had a lot of experience with the run-of-the-mill people all over the place.

59:13.980 --> 59:23.831
But this thing here, that was easy because it was objective.

59:24.893 --> 59:30.379
This has been terrible because I'm personally involved in it.

59:31.287 --> 59:33.310
And you don't know how it's going to end yet, either?

59:33.330 --> 59:33.590
No.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.014
Where did you go to med school, by the way?

59:36.034 --> 59:36.835
Northwestern.

59:36.855 --> 59:36.995
Uh-huh.

59:37.856 --> 59:38.337
Chicago.

59:38.918 --> 59:39.018
Okay.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.441
And did you tell me how old you are?

59:41.461 --> 59:41.862
73.

59:42.323 --> 59:47.450
They're probably wondering what we're doing, so I think I got an hour.

59:47.470 --> 59:49.974
You got about all you can handle with me.

59:49.994 --> 59:54.320
Is there anything else you think I should know about this that you can think of?

59:57.624 --> 01:00:00.889
Oh, I could think of a million things that I don't think of.

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:08.154
Do you think I got the most salient observations?

01:00:10.437 --> 01:00:14.781
If I would understand one thing about Stephen, what should I understand?

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:30.859
He's an extremely lovable, extremely affectionate, caring individual who feels inadequate

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:37.815
but actually is far brighter than the people around me.

01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:50.628
And brighter than people like me who, while I'm no dummy, I don't have his insights into aesthetic things like he does.

01:00:51.769 --> 01:01:01.639
And I think he feels a little lost because other people don't, most people don't have this

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.742
Aesthetic feeling.

01:01:03.782 --> 01:01:09.348
Very sensitivity, you may call it.

01:01:09.368 --> 01:01:09.909
Yeah.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.050
Do you love him?

01:01:11.591 --> 01:01:12.332
Oh, very much.

01:01:12.372 --> 01:01:14.254
We're very close.

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:16.177
I love the daughter, too, though.

01:01:16.197 --> 01:01:17.859
What's your daughter's name?

01:01:17.899 --> 01:01:22.424
Mary and I named her after this little girl that died when I was 16 years old.

01:01:24.907 --> 01:01:26.570
Wish you the best of luck with it, Doctor.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.073
Thank you.

01:01:29.093 --> 01:01:31.896
They better go back upstairs before they went to her head in the house.

01:01:32.568 --> 01:01:35.171
It's been really an agonizing sort of thing.

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:40.678
Sometimes I've wondered how I've survived.

01:01:41.679 --> 01:01:44.583
It's been tough.

01:01:44.603 --> 01:01:53.814
You were quoted in some of the papers, and maybe when this story broke on the wires, I remember you were being very honest with some of the newspapers, too honest.

01:01:53.834 --> 01:01:55.656
You said, well, my son's always been an oddball.

01:01:55.696 --> 01:01:57.718
Was that a direct quote?

01:01:57.738 --> 01:01:58.780
I mean, was that a correct quote?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.841
That was a correct quote.

01:02:00.293 --> 01:02:02.076
How did you feel when you said that?

01:02:02.096 --> 01:02:04.760
Were you upset and angry, or was that just the truth?

01:02:05.561 --> 01:02:26.976
Well, I had to, I felt as if I had to, in some way, counteract the impressions that the FBI were making, that he was a master thief, and to, in common vernacular, advise them that instead of that, he was an eccentric,

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:33.423
psychiatrically disturbed individual who needs help and has never hurt anybody.

01:02:33.443 --> 01:02:35.850
I think that's very important.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:40.442
This is not, there's no violence involved in this matter.
