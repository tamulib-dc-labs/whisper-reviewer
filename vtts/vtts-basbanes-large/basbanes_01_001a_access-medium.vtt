WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:03.592
My tape recorder's on.

00:03.652 --> 00:05.514
It's the 26th of January, 1991.

00:06.035 --> 00:10.000
We're in a nice old silver Cadillac being driven by Stephen Plumper.

00:10.901 --> 00:20.012
Okay, I'm going to give you an example of something that happened years ago, and then I'll explain to you who we're going over to see.

00:20.032 --> 00:21.113
Where are we right now?

00:21.133 --> 00:26.679
We're in Des Moines.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.540
I don't know the streets.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.424
But we're in the city of Des Moines.

00:30.444 --> 00:30.544
Yeah.

00:31.402 --> 00:39.050
But we're going to go over and see some people that are friends of mine that have taken me off the street.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.631
I've been a stranger in this city.

00:41.412 --> 00:46.277
And I had to wander around with no place to go and really knowing nobody.

00:46.337 --> 00:52.603
And some of the people of Des Moines have had empathy with me and taken me off the street.

00:54.144 --> 00:59.890
And I know a lot of people like these people in Minneapolis, too.

01:00.359 --> 01:04.103
You said something that you could go to Street Kings in Minneapolis.

01:04.683 --> 01:06.785
What did you say?

01:07.106 --> 01:16.134
Well, I lived in the old rundown part of the city that was Victorian before it became popular.

01:17.435 --> 01:22.180
And I've always liked the down and outers.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.483
I felt myself somewhat down and out.

01:25.503 --> 01:27.345
And I feel a

01:29.232 --> 01:34.219
I have a way of helping them, and they mutually help me.

01:35.601 --> 01:43.633
But these people here, the mother has taken me into her home.

01:43.793 --> 01:45.416
I've eaten there.

01:45.576 --> 01:49.502
I also have helped somewhat financially.

01:49.522 --> 01:51.144
I bought food for them and so forth.

01:51.164 --> 01:56.472
They've given me a place to go, sort of as a fugitive, and I, in turn,

01:57.532 --> 02:04.499
have voluntarily given them food and money and so forth because they've opened their home up to me.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.763
But there's an interesting thing about this.

02:08.803 --> 02:18.352
This is a type of home where most of the young people, or probably none of them have graduated from high school.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.354
They're totally uneducated.

02:22.436 --> 02:24.619
And they have a little problem with the system.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.020
The system is...

02:28.025 --> 02:30.167
kind of turn their back on these kind of people.

02:31.488 --> 02:38.314
And these are the kind of people that are never going to enjoy the culture of rare books and antiques and art.

02:38.334 --> 02:44.300
I figure people that are not aware and that don't know this are sort of like being color blind.

02:44.320 --> 02:49.525
They're not totally blind, but they're not seeing the full aspects of life and culture.

02:50.746 --> 02:55.310
And I've always tried to share this with people through my possessions.

02:56.491 --> 02:57.492
And they have shared

02:57.927 --> 03:03.715
their companionship with me, so I haven't been lonely.

03:05.197 --> 03:18.054
Anyhow, we'll go over there, and what I have to do for their benefit is I'll go in and talk with the mother.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.997
This is a single parent home.

03:20.017 --> 03:20.678
The father

03:20.894 --> 03:23.617
has had his leg cut off and he's living someplace else.

03:23.638 --> 03:30.006
They have to live separate because she says they can't get welfare benefits or something if they live together.

03:30.506 --> 03:34.511
So they're living separate in poverty.

03:35.633 --> 03:43.603
She's taken in a couple of other unwed mothers to help sustain the home.

03:45.305 --> 03:47.408
See, she's taken in some street people.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.985
Okay, sure.

03:50.045 --> 03:50.746
You have your way out here?

03:51.327 --> 03:53.650
Well, it's down a few blocks.

03:53.731 --> 03:58.678
But the thing is, I just wanted to know who you are and what you're about.

03:59.699 --> 04:00.921
I won't spend too much time here.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.883
No, no, no.

04:01.903 --> 04:05.268
And I thought her son Adam wanted to go down and see the house in the tumwa.

04:06.209 --> 04:10.536
And you can learn from these people.

04:10.556 --> 04:12.879
These people, all they have are offers themselves.

04:12.959 --> 04:14.562
They don't have any money or anything else.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.905
And these are the type of people that

04:19.568 --> 04:21.070
are basically good people.

04:21.270 --> 04:23.413
Like I say, all they got is themselves.

04:24.515 --> 04:33.868
And yet, the educational system, maybe she can't communicate or whatever, has turned their back on these people.

04:33.888 --> 04:35.771
Her kid has been kicked out of school.

04:35.811 --> 04:36.732
She's gone to school.

04:36.812 --> 04:39.155
The mother's gone to school and tried to get the kid in.

04:39.856 --> 04:40.858
They argue with her.

04:40.898 --> 04:42.500
They're abusive.

04:42.520 --> 04:49.069
And these are the kind of people that are never, as our

04:49.370 --> 05:03.671
society evolves and there's more education and technology, and as education becomes the necessity of surviving in our culture, these are the kind of people that are going to slip through the cracks.

05:03.691 --> 05:15.548
And I just feel that the educational system, you know, on a lower level is spending what they can't.

05:15.788 --> 05:17.831
So we'll go over and we'll meet Mrs. Madison.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.073
She's been a friend of mine.

05:19.424 --> 05:38.412
and uh maybe i took a friend of hers down to the house or maybe her son is wanting to go maybe we'll take him along we'll you can visit with him you can visit with her and uh go down to otomo but mostly we'll talk about you know how where i lived i'm interested in talking about books too oh yeah yeah and

05:38.594 --> 05:48.171
I have a friend named Mr. Hall living at the house who sort of took me in in Cincinnati years ago, and I've given him a place to live for the rest of his days.

05:48.471 --> 05:49.553
How did you find it somewhere?

05:50.935 --> 05:52.318
It was kind of by accident.

05:52.398 --> 06:00.552
I was looking at a place in Missouri, and I came back up here, and I was with my father and uncle, and he said, why don't you look at...

06:02.877 --> 06:04.559
some of the towns around here.

06:04.579 --> 06:06.000
So we happened out of Tumlin.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.542
I happened to find this house.

06:07.562 --> 06:13.888
Because rent was so high in Minneapolis, I was having to move because of urban renewal every year or so.

06:13.928 --> 06:18.173
And I wanted to get to some place where I wouldn't be torn down and pushed out by a building.

06:18.193 --> 06:19.614
You wanted a big place, too.

06:19.674 --> 06:20.996
Yeah.

06:21.016 --> 06:22.117
So I got this.

06:22.137 --> 06:23.699
I wound up in Tumlin.

06:23.719 --> 06:26.421
It's kind of like.

06:26.441 --> 06:27.523
So 18 and 16.

06:29.344 --> 06:30.105
I don't know.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.787
I know how to get there, but I don't know how.

06:32.510 --> 06:34.532
Now what year is this caddy?

06:34.552 --> 06:34.832
76.

06:37.155 --> 06:42.801
Last of the old full-size cars.

06:42.821 --> 06:44.263
What do I need to know about Stevie?

06:44.343 --> 06:46.505
Let me ask you a first question.

06:46.525 --> 06:49.608
Your name is spelled S-T-E-B-E-S-T-E-P-H.

06:49.688 --> 06:51.470
Which one is it?

06:51.490 --> 06:51.570
P-H.

06:51.591 --> 06:55.114
Why do they have a V-E-N and all the damn papers?

06:56.135 --> 06:57.657
I mean the papers at the courthouse.

06:58.531 --> 07:00.735
They're all B-E-N.

07:01.997 --> 07:04.681
It's crazy, isn't it?

07:04.701 --> 07:06.964
But you prefer P-H-E-N.

07:08.186 --> 07:08.467
Yeah.

07:08.727 --> 07:10.791
Well, I didn't call them words.

07:11.191 --> 07:20.626
I understand, but we're going to put you in between night covers if we want to get it right.

07:20.646 --> 07:21.427
So what do I know?

07:22.529 --> 07:23.551
Introduce yourself to me.

07:23.731 --> 07:25.534
I'm really interested in your collecting.

07:26.695 --> 07:29.378
Oh, I'm kind of like Jerry is.

07:29.598 --> 07:34.064
He used to go to a lot of garage sales, and yard sales, and old houses.

07:34.925 --> 07:39.029
There's girls go in these old empty houses around town looking for stuff.

07:39.109 --> 07:43.575
There's a lot of beautiful stuff, these old gerald buildings.

07:43.595 --> 07:47.539
You could see they're collectors too, like I am, aren't they?

07:47.559 --> 07:48.500
I don't know.

07:50.523 --> 07:53.186
I think they're probably a collector on a much larger scale.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.407
Yeah, yeah.

07:55.383 --> 07:57.445
But you've been collecting all your life, right?

07:57.485 --> 07:59.027
Yeah.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.890
When did the passion for books start?

08:01.910 --> 08:09.758
All back in my teens.

08:09.778 --> 08:13.222
When the focus started, I mean, from everything I could see.

08:13.362 --> 08:17.867
I really started out, I was interested in 78 photograph records and books.

08:18.047 --> 08:21.291
I had thousands of those too.

08:21.431 --> 08:22.452
You listened to them?

08:22.672 --> 08:24.394
Yeah, yeah.

08:25.454 --> 08:48.835
Back before 1910, the gimmick was they'd sell you a cheap machine, and then they had different ways of recording or different sizes of holes, and you'd buy the machine, but then you'd get hooked into having to buy the record that was modified to the machine, like the PathÃ© records and the Edison records were recorded in a Hill and Dale process.

08:48.875 --> 08:49.977
That means the sound

08:50.868 --> 08:54.171
When a loud note was sounded or something, it cut a deeper groove.

08:54.211 --> 09:01.459
We couldn't play those records on a Victrola because those were recorded laterally or side to side or like the Columbia's.

09:01.479 --> 09:06.804
So you had to have all these different machines to play all these different records.

09:07.225 --> 09:13.791
So I had this large collection of these old antique machines to play the different kind of records.

09:13.811 --> 09:18.276
Because I liked music before 1930.

09:19.066 --> 09:32.483
Before 1930, this country had a lot of immigrants and ethnic groups, and they recorded a lot of ethnic music that sort of has been lost after the Second World War.

09:32.563 --> 09:42.957
For instance, I had the Austro-Hungarian national air and the Tsars ran march and things like that, which are sort of obsolete tunes.

09:42.977 --> 09:45.440
Do you think, Stephen, that you were trying to build an iPad?

09:46.001 --> 09:46.862
Yeah, I was.

09:47.939 --> 09:53.086
And I tried to learn everything I could about anything I was interested in.

09:53.106 --> 09:55.750
What, in your view, is the purpose of an archive?

09:55.770 --> 10:01.198
Is it to serve scholarship, to document posterity, or what?

10:01.318 --> 10:09.770
To serve humanity, every aspect of humanity, not just the fortunate that can afford.

10:10.171 --> 10:17.541
It seems that there's education in this country up to a certain point.

10:17.791 --> 10:27.503
If some of the people don't conform or can't conform or don't know how to conform, they're kind of pushed out of the educational system in a sense.

10:28.164 --> 10:33.090
And then, of course, if they make it through high school, then they have to have the wherewithal to go beyond.

10:33.130 --> 10:38.376
For instance, Jerry has an eight-year-old or ten-year-old daughter, and guess what she wants to be?

10:38.897 --> 10:40.539
An archaeologist.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.022
I've always...

10:43.492 --> 10:46.736
twin passions as a child were archaeology and astronomy.

10:47.056 --> 10:48.377
Yeah.

10:49.679 --> 10:52.001
Just odd by the stars.

10:52.021 --> 10:52.762
Yeah.

10:53.243 --> 10:59.289
So just like Jerry, she's interested and does beautiful work with Victorian dresses.

10:59.309 --> 11:04.235
That must have just thrown you over when you saw those Victorian dresses.

11:04.995 --> 11:05.996
Well, yeah.

11:06.157 --> 11:09.100
Her skill did, but it doesn't surprise me.

11:10.141 --> 11:11.102
There's culture.

11:12.652 --> 11:14.074
On all levels, you know.

11:14.114 --> 11:17.640
That wasn't the direction of my point.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.846
My point was the fact that she was creating these Victorian items.

11:21.866 --> 11:22.247
Oh, yeah.

11:22.387 --> 11:27.294
Where you yourself are particularly fond of the Victorian era.

11:27.314 --> 11:27.875
Yeah, yeah.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.099
That's what I meant.

11:30.179 --> 11:30.359
Yeah.

11:30.579 --> 11:34.025
In other circumstances.

11:34.045 --> 11:34.145
Yeah.

11:34.165 --> 11:36.128
What can't we talk about, Stephen?

11:36.148 --> 11:37.971
I don't want to dance around.

11:39.153 --> 11:39.573
Oh, gosh.

11:39.593 --> 11:39.854
I don't know.

11:39.874 --> 11:40.735
I can't.

11:41.592 --> 11:46.558
I guess I can't talk about particulars in case at this time.

11:46.578 --> 11:47.639
It's still pending.

11:47.760 --> 11:51.064
And I don't want to jeopardize you in any way.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.165
Yeah, yeah.

11:52.185 --> 11:56.571
But by the same token, I do want to talk about your collecting and your interest in your collecting.

11:57.231 --> 11:59.995
Well, I've got an interest in people, too.

12:00.015 --> 12:02.438
That's sort of really intertwined with it.

12:02.458 --> 12:08.325
I've really always, since I left home and...

12:08.660 --> 12:10.321
You know, I've been out on my own.

12:10.341 --> 12:23.033
I've sort of been having the, you know, I've been with different groups of people just, you know, because I had to.

12:23.053 --> 12:25.114
Like in here I could get to Des Moines.

12:25.134 --> 12:25.555
I don't know anybody.

12:25.575 --> 12:26.476
I had to find somebody.

12:26.496 --> 12:34.403
So I find Rick under the bridge and his friends and these people.

12:34.423 --> 12:37.165
It's nice to be accepted.

12:38.090 --> 12:57.851
I guess we could talk generally... My book starts with a sense that the most painful... At every point in the life of every collector, there comes a point where the precious volumes must pass to other hands, where we have to face the fact that we're merely custodians of these things.

12:57.871 --> 12:59.152
I've said the same thing.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.054
It's, in fact, the same order.

13:01.154 --> 13:01.675
Is that right?

13:02.015 --> 13:03.196
Yeah.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.958
And I wonder what your...

13:05.765 --> 13:07.127
what your feeling was?

13:07.187 --> 13:10.250
What were your plans for this library that you were building?

13:10.270 --> 13:12.352
Well, I didn't get the chance.

13:12.553 --> 13:18.920
I always was worried that it would be destroyed or wouldn't pass on.

13:18.940 --> 13:26.428
I think, like you say, our duty is just you're curators of take care and pass on.

13:26.488 --> 13:26.889
Yeah.

13:28.390 --> 13:32.515
But I did that with everything, Victorian architectural ornaments and

13:33.001 --> 13:36.365
So much of it isn't being cared for and is being destroyed.

13:36.826 --> 13:40.911
Yeah, but the point is, you dealt in other antiques.

13:40.931 --> 13:43.454
You retained books.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.958
Why is that?

13:45.978 --> 13:49.162
Well, the books were a source of reference for stuff.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.745
More than reference, though.

13:51.765 --> 13:56.050
I mean, the books on discovery and exploration, early settlers.

13:56.131 --> 14:01.978
Well, as I travel, I'm always interested in why is this place here?

14:02.228 --> 14:09.717
or what happened or, you know, history is just a lot of, it's planned, but most of it's circumstance.

14:10.078 --> 14:18.127
So everywhere I went in the country, I could get into a small town or whatever, and I'd note a little something about the history.

14:18.147 --> 14:20.470
And I'm just always curious.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.513
You know, I don't take the interstate highways that much.

14:22.533 --> 14:26.297
I take the back roads.

14:26.317 --> 14:28.841
How many miles would you say you've driven over the last 20 years?

14:28.901 --> 14:30.042
Have you ever tried to figure it?

14:30.410 --> 14:32.973
I imagine over a million miles.

14:33.474 --> 14:35.657
I drive over a hundred thousand miles a year.

14:35.677 --> 14:36.358
You like the road?

14:36.638 --> 14:36.838
Yeah.

14:37.940 --> 14:42.986
And meeting people on the road.

14:43.006 --> 14:45.429
And how many cars have you had over the last 20 years?

14:45.449 --> 14:48.173
40.

14:48.193 --> 14:48.693
40 cars?

14:49.254 --> 14:50.175
And you like old ones?

14:50.416 --> 14:52.258
Yeah.

14:52.378 --> 14:55.662
What would you say is the most contemporary car you've ever had?

14:55.702 --> 14:56.103
This one.

14:56.323 --> 14:56.764
This one?

14:56.784 --> 14:57.705
76?

14:57.725 --> 14:57.885
Yeah.

15:03.282 --> 15:05.004
Would you like to have lived 100 years ago?

15:05.024 --> 15:06.825
Yeah, I think I would.

15:06.845 --> 15:08.527
Would it have been a more agreeable time to live?

15:09.248 --> 15:09.768
Yeah.

15:10.329 --> 15:15.393
Yeah, it was, people were more, I think, more honest with each other.

15:16.655 --> 15:25.603
They could rely on each other more instead of on the system.

15:25.623 --> 15:29.026
People could have their own, like, home industries.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.028
Like if Jerry tried to open up

15:32.797 --> 15:39.704
some sort of a business there, she'd have to get a license, and it would just, it seems like you're held down.

15:41.566 --> 15:51.737
You can get up so far, but if you get up to a point, you have to, you know, like Henry Ford, for instance, could have never been in the automobile today.

15:51.757 --> 16:01.487
Anything that's changed is first resistant, and then as people see it,

16:02.294 --> 16:04.296
benefits and they gradually accept them.

16:05.016 --> 16:32.301
But for instance, Henry Ford with the automobile, he'd go out and with today's regulations, if he started building these forceless carriages in his garage, he couldn't hire employees because he probably wouldn't have had enough money to pay social security, pay this, pay that.

16:32.990 --> 16:36.835
pay health benefits and so forth.

16:37.276 --> 16:49.872
Just the overcoming of the bureaucracy for first of limited means would have been beyond his capabilities and the horse's carriage might not come into being if we hadn't had all the restraints.

16:51.975 --> 16:56.461
Okay, I'm back on again.

16:56.501 --> 16:56.601
Yeah.

16:57.948 --> 17:00.751
So you'd say you've driven about a million miles over the last 20 years?

17:00.972 --> 17:01.532
Oh yeah, yeah.

17:01.552 --> 17:06.699
I'm not so sure I got tighter on the air, but I want to make sure we get it again.

17:06.719 --> 17:13.587
And I do want to ask you again, just to make sure I have it, that you felt that you were being a custodian?

17:14.248 --> 17:15.289
Oh, absolutely.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.072
Maybe you might talk about that a little more.

17:18.092 --> 17:25.221
And I try to share that with young people, you know, and I learn from the old people, like Mr. Howe,

17:26.855 --> 17:35.947
Like he tells me about his youth, he was brought up in the hills of Kentucky and his folks were killed at a very young age in flood.

17:35.967 --> 17:51.327
He was put in the Louisville Baptist orphan home and adopted out to some people called the Spurlocks who had a mule and a sharecropper's farm.

17:51.998 --> 17:55.142
I don't think he ever knew his real father.

17:55.162 --> 17:56.603
Barely knew his mother.

17:56.623 --> 18:04.272
But it's interesting to talk about the past with him and how things were in the old days.

18:05.434 --> 18:17.888
I'm always interested in recording the old people's ways and then passing it on to the young people, like Adam, because, for instance... And how do you do that in recording?

18:20.703 --> 18:22.906
You can't really do it like in a classroom.

18:22.926 --> 18:24.428
You have to live it, you know.

18:24.448 --> 18:34.162
You have to get two groups together and get them to mix.

18:34.202 --> 18:40.010
Like, I used to have a lot of old people that would sell me stuff or that would go to estate sales.

18:40.030 --> 18:46.259
And I'd have the young people along with me to help me load the stuff and work with it.

18:46.279 --> 18:49.984
So, you know, the two groups would mix, which

18:50.757 --> 18:58.266
generally wouldn't socialize otherwise, and they'd get an interest and respect for one another, you know.

18:58.286 --> 19:08.379
How did you feel yesterday, and this won't relate to anything, but how did you feel when you saw all those people walking by the table and handling the Nuremberg Chronicle and these papers?

19:08.419 --> 19:11.943
Well, I was hoping they'd handle it carefully.

19:11.983 --> 19:13.245
Did it upset you?

19:13.265 --> 19:17.490
Did you feel any kind of... No, I wished I could have been over there telling them about it.

19:17.875 --> 19:18.736
What they were.

19:19.117 --> 19:24.145
In fact, that Costanzo book isn't an original.

19:24.165 --> 19:27.711
It's a reprint from the 30s, and they've got it mis... Really?

19:27.771 --> 19:28.452
The Costanzo?

19:28.672 --> 19:29.033
Yeah.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.178
They've got it misidentified.

19:32.198 --> 19:32.298
Yeah.

19:35.183 --> 19:42.054
I imagine the Hano Library knows what it is, but that was one of the Sam Marano 80 books.

19:42.875 --> 19:43.917
And...

19:44.116 --> 19:48.782
The original of that would be very, very rare, but that was a 1930s reprint.

19:48.802 --> 19:53.208
It was probably a privately done thing by Henry R. Wagner.

19:53.228 --> 20:04.802
He was the cartologist and scholar of Spanish Southwest America in his day.

20:04.822 --> 20:12.572
In fact, he wrote a wonderful bibliography called The Spanish Southwest, and he published it in Albuquerque.

20:12.592 --> 20:13.954
It was part of a series.

20:15.250 --> 20:18.394
of books, the Spanish Southwest.

20:19.977 --> 20:25.024
And it's still the bibliography of colonial Southwest America.

20:25.044 --> 20:28.008
But he did some privately printed stuff like that.

20:28.268 --> 20:44.751
One of the things that I've noted, and I've interviewed perhaps 25 really interesting collectors so far, is that inevitably there comes a point where I know that this person knows his books.

20:45.153 --> 20:51.722
And I have to wonder, I mean, when you acquired a book, I have to believe it didn't go immediately on the shelf.

20:51.842 --> 20:57.230
I mean, you must have read it and devoured it and certainly became intimate with it.

20:57.370 --> 21:01.095
Well, generally, I knew about the book before I acquired it.

21:01.656 --> 21:01.936
Really?

21:01.996 --> 21:03.058
I knew its significance.

21:03.238 --> 21:09.827
Whether it was in a library or in a junk store at the bottom of the box, I knew it instantly.

21:09.847 --> 21:10.989
How did you find out about it?

21:11.109 --> 21:14.113
I read it before you went to acquire it.

21:14.380 --> 21:15.101
Oh, I read.

21:15.161 --> 21:15.461
I knew.

21:15.961 --> 21:16.182
You knew?

21:16.202 --> 21:18.084
You know, I knew bibliographies.

21:18.124 --> 21:20.546
So you had a want list?

21:20.566 --> 21:21.146
In my head.

21:22.568 --> 21:22.708
Uh-huh.

21:22.728 --> 21:25.430
And some things I'd write down, very little I would, but I'd know.

21:27.532 --> 21:29.674
And the goal was to create a collection.

21:30.796 --> 21:32.637
Is that a fair statement?

21:32.657 --> 21:43.948
Well, partly, and most of it was security, because I feel there's an article a few days ago in the paper where there

21:45.008 --> 21:46.671
going to devalue the ruble.

21:46.691 --> 21:49.276
You see, paper money is nothing but a promise to pay.

21:50.038 --> 21:54.847
It's not actually, it says right on the note, this note is legal tender.

21:54.867 --> 22:02.302
Well, when I was a kid, a dollar bill used to say this, his note is redeemable in one dollar in silver.

22:02.643 --> 22:07.472
And the government with their paper money is sort of like

22:08.397 --> 22:15.264
A guy with a stolen checkbook that's getting away with it, he's going to write as many checks and the government's going to print as many bank notes as he can.

22:16.065 --> 22:23.594
They have nothing to back it by that's exchangeable, you know.

22:23.614 --> 22:36.868
And gold is, you know, gold or people's work or food's even more valuable, but it's their commodities that are exchangeable for

22:37.405 --> 23:02.620
a promise to pay of course in order in order to have a commercial system i mean you said security though you you equated the books with security what did you mean the books were security in in that they were a form of knowledge or a form of uh art and that to be enjoyed mostly as a form of knowledge and something to impart knowledge on to other people who

23:03.106 --> 23:11.338
oftentimes wouldn't have had the opportunity to have access to that knowledge or to open new avenues of knowledge to people, you know.

23:11.358 --> 23:12.700
Okay, now you talk about access.

23:14.583 --> 23:19.531
Did you at some point want the world to know about the Stephen Blumberg collection?

23:19.551 --> 23:25.961
Yeah, but I'll mention something that happened early, very early in my collecting about access.

23:26.842 --> 23:28.945
I was going around Minneapolis

23:29.347 --> 23:32.494
looking at the Victorian house, and I picked up with an old man.

23:32.514 --> 23:36.462
His name was Doc, and he was a draker and a wino, and he didn't have many friends.

23:37.183 --> 23:43.938
But Doc remembered a part of town called Elliott Park, right near downtown Minneapolis as a boy.

23:44.038 --> 23:45.060
He grew up there.

23:45.749 --> 23:55.762
And there was a mansion in particular on 10th Avenue and 14th that was the old Shaw Mansion that was torn down for a high-rise nursing home that I had a picture of in a book.

23:56.322 --> 24:10.120
And I was showing it to old Doc and he says, I remember as a kid going over there and they had a barn and some cows and they would give milk to my mother and our family.

24:12.513 --> 24:14.315
so we could have milk for the children.

24:14.375 --> 24:20.242
And I remember going to the back door and Mrs. Shaw giving us milk.

24:20.322 --> 24:24.166
And I remember going in that house and going through it.

24:25.367 --> 24:34.678
Well, this is a house that has, it was a Victorian mansion that has no documentation in Minneapolis at all, except that there's an illustration of it in Atwater's history of Minneapolis.

24:35.339 --> 24:39.263
So I wanted to go down to the public library and further

24:39.428 --> 24:52.243
check on this place, because here I had an individual, a man, probably the last living being who could describe the Shaw Mansion, who was a contemporary of the old Shaw Mansion.

24:52.263 --> 25:02.375
So I go down there and I ask the curator, you know, I looked up in the car catalog, I asked the curator, can I look at pictures of Minneapolis homes?

25:02.415 --> 25:03.917
There was a listing in there.

25:03.937 --> 25:08.642
I want to see if there's any photos of this home or

25:10.664 --> 25:22.159
something about it because I have a man here that he was somewhat drunk at the time but who had seen one of these homes firsthand and I wanted to just look through these pictures because he could

25:22.932 --> 25:24.514
say, oh, that's it.

25:24.534 --> 25:27.096
A lot of the pictures weren't chronicled as to where they were.

25:27.176 --> 25:35.224
I knew some of them, but they just had, you know, a vanilla folder full of pictures and interiors of old Minneapolis residences.

25:35.725 --> 25:39.809
And I wanted him to, if we spotted it, he'd say, that was it.

25:39.829 --> 25:43.072
I remember that, or I remember this corner, or I remember that.

25:43.092 --> 25:47.877
So I go in there, and some stuffy old woman says,

25:48.329 --> 26:00.509
Well, yeah, you can look at this, and she sits with us, and she says, she looks at her watch, and she says, well, I've only got 15 minutes with you people, and... That upset you?

26:00.709 --> 26:06.438
Yeah, because here I had... A primary resource, shall we say.

26:06.458 --> 26:15.653
Yeah, she didn't even want to hear about that this fella had actually seen this place, or hear his...

26:16.105 --> 26:17.147
part of history.

26:17.588 --> 26:29.997
You know, maybe if I go to the Minneapolis Historical Society or something and somebody was doing research on Elliott Park mansions or on Shaw, I could tell them that Mrs. Shaw helped out.

26:31.327 --> 26:58.313
indigent people in the area and i could tell them a little bit about the home that they had a barn and had a cow and so forth because i talked with somebody that personally sure i was part of those people's life i living in the late 20th century am a link to the 19th century and i can depart depart that information on to adam who's going to live into the 21st century beyond me you see

26:59.221 --> 27:04.327
You're talking about acquiring this information on an interpersonal basis.

27:04.367 --> 27:04.808
Yeah.

27:04.828 --> 27:06.590
See, I'm a curator of knowledge.

27:06.630 --> 27:09.053
You see?

27:09.073 --> 27:11.056
I've read this phrase, Didion of the past.

27:11.076 --> 27:12.337
Is this a phrase of yours?

27:13.539 --> 27:15.601
Well, I've read of it another time.

27:16.763 --> 27:19.366
Is this a rescuer of the past?

27:19.386 --> 27:22.630
Is that a phrase that you've used to describe your activities?

27:22.880 --> 27:23.721
Would you say?

27:23.781 --> 27:27.486
Pretty much, yeah, because it's been on all different levels besides books.

27:27.726 --> 27:32.111
And I've always been eager to impart this on to other people.

27:32.131 --> 27:38.719
The books are one sense of it, music, architectural things, but the most precious thing is knowledge.

27:40.401 --> 27:42.284
Adam, do you agree with this, Adam?

27:42.324 --> 27:44.426
Was Stephen passing information on to you?

27:45.688 --> 27:45.828
Yeah.

27:45.848 --> 27:46.609
Like what?

27:47.332 --> 27:52.100
I mean, he's taken me to a new place.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.265
I've never really been to a tunnel.

27:55.605 --> 27:56.086
And I don't know.

27:56.226 --> 27:58.350
I think there's stuff that I'd like to see.

27:58.370 --> 28:03.097
And he's told me there's antiques and everything at his house.

28:04.039 --> 28:06.022
And I'd like to see some of them.

28:06.042 --> 28:09.928
He likes little knickknacks and things.

28:09.948 --> 28:12.272
I just thought it was a good opportunity to ask a question.

28:12.412 --> 28:12.533
Yeah.

28:12.553 --> 28:13.474
You made the reference.

28:13.977 --> 28:29.212
Did you know, Adam, years ago, they used to, people used to have cows and things in their house, or in their yard and that, and people grew their own food and people were more self-sustaining.

28:29.232 --> 28:33.176
They didn't go to the supermarkets and that.

28:33.196 --> 28:34.898
What's the road you're on?

28:34.958 --> 28:40.423
We're on Highway 92 heading east into Los Caloos, and then we're never dropped out of the hotel room.

28:43.508 --> 29:12.807
beautiful countryside now are these cornfields or this yeah this is probably all cornfields that's iowa it's nice country i like the difference in culture too i notice your new england culture i'm a minneapolis in which we're sort of minnesotans are either farmers or urbanites half of the citizens of the state of minnesota live in the big

29:13.647 --> 29:14.629
Minneapolis-St.

29:14.689 --> 29:15.932
Paul metropolitan area.

29:16.012 --> 29:23.689
So we're the Minnesota the half of the city folks versus the half of the country folks.

29:23.709 --> 29:26.135
Now Iowans by large are rural.

29:26.215 --> 29:31.707
You can notice even though these people are from Des Moines, you can notice

29:32.142 --> 29:36.528
similarities in your culture and my culture that are different from their culture.

29:36.548 --> 29:41.514
Their culture, even though they live in the biggest city in Iowa, is still somewhat rural, isn't it?

29:41.795 --> 29:42.496
That's right.

29:42.516 --> 29:49.244
In comparison to ours, you know.

29:49.264 --> 29:51.607
Did you ever fear for your safety at all while you were acquiring?

29:51.748 --> 29:52.849
Oh, quite a bit, yeah.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.212
Quite a bit.

29:55.232 --> 29:58.977
But then again, once I got to know people in the areas, I don't.

29:59.227 --> 30:05.114
I imagine the east side of Des Moines is one of the rough areas of Des Moines, but I'm pretty much safe there.

30:05.254 --> 30:06.676
I know people there.

30:06.756 --> 30:11.282
But I mean while you were building the collection?

30:11.302 --> 30:14.005
Oh, yeah, somewhat.

30:14.866 --> 30:19.212
A lot of what I collected was out of the slums of the city, you know.

30:19.232 --> 30:22.576
Books, too?

30:22.596 --> 30:28.423
Yeah, some, and then in other respects, you had to...

30:30.867 --> 30:38.914
I never really did have much fear for my safety as far as the book, so I didn't figure some librarian was going to shoot me or anything.

30:38.994 --> 30:43.719
But I mean, did you think that some night there might be an armed guard or something like that, or no?

30:43.739 --> 30:45.260
No, I'd know that.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.781
There was.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.864
I was able to find that out.

30:51.225 --> 30:52.967
Was it exciting?

30:52.987 --> 30:53.327
Oh, yeah.

30:54.608 --> 30:55.469
Or was it scary?

30:55.489 --> 31:00.053
Well, I was sort of consumed by the passion to collect.

31:00.073 --> 31:00.874
I really didn't.

31:02.457 --> 31:26.389
in my mind seeing an original costanzo or something i'd be so involved in that i wouldn't really think about the why's or the where did you want the world to know about your collection at some point yeah i did i was gonna if i died leave a endowment to sort of

31:27.061 --> 31:32.269
have this discovered, and to have these go back to the proper curators.

31:33.190 --> 31:44.527
And in a way, I'm living, now that this thing has come out, I figure this has been my death, and I'm living after my death.

31:44.547 --> 31:50.976
You're seeing the things that might have happened, that you might not otherwise have happened.

31:51.496 --> 31:53.939
Yeah, I'm living after my death.

31:53.959 --> 31:57.763
Well, are you enjoying it in that regard?

31:57.863 --> 32:15.241
In the regard of being able to share it with you and Adam and Jerry and so forth, but I'm not enjoying looking forward to the possible consequences and seeing the injustices that are being done.

32:15.641 --> 32:16.622
Like what injustices?

32:17.043 --> 32:21.267
Like roads ripping off the stuff and simply selling it.

32:22.208 --> 32:26.093
You never suspected him at all as being the Judas in your house?

32:26.113 --> 32:27.895
No, he acted like a kind man.

32:28.596 --> 32:29.698
Neither did Mr. Hall.

32:29.778 --> 32:34.544
He's a professional government con, is what he is.

32:34.564 --> 32:37.568
And in fact, I was involved very much in his personal life.

32:37.668 --> 32:38.910
I knew him for 15 years.

32:38.970 --> 32:41.393
I knew his wife before they got married.

32:41.834 --> 32:48.182
I know of the tragedies and the pain that he's caused personally in his life.

32:50.795 --> 32:58.382
His wife is afraid to assist me because she says he's a threat to kill her.

32:58.402 --> 32:59.222
Really?

32:59.242 --> 33:02.585
He's a very violent, vicious person.

33:02.685 --> 33:07.710
And that seems to be the kind of people the government likes to identify with and to conceal.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.431
They don't want to be honest about this.

33:09.451 --> 33:10.892
My day of honesty has come.

33:10.912 --> 33:13.435
My day of court is here.

33:13.455 --> 33:16.077
Everybody's world's going to know about me.

33:17.298 --> 33:19.620
But yet the government doesn't want to be honest and

33:20.140 --> 33:21.181
Talk to you.

33:21.221 --> 33:24.485
Are you involved in a conspiracy with them?

33:24.645 --> 33:25.526
Collaboration.

33:25.546 --> 33:25.947
Yeah.

33:25.967 --> 33:27.709
Or collaboration is what they said.

33:27.729 --> 33:29.831
Yeah.

33:29.851 --> 33:35.078
Or Rhodes says, as you told me, yeah, I'm a bad guy.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.199
I am a bad guy.

33:36.539 --> 33:36.639
Yeah.

33:36.659 --> 33:37.460
I am a bad guy.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.424
Yeah, he is a bad guy.

33:40.444 --> 33:41.906
And he looked me in the eyes when he said it.

33:41.926 --> 33:42.867
Yeah.

33:42.887 --> 33:47.292
And he said it's in a chill-up, I suppose.

33:47.312 --> 33:47.432
Yeah.

33:47.452 --> 33:48.173
But, hey.

33:49.047 --> 33:51.169
I wonder why he waited 15 years.

33:51.590 --> 33:56.094
Do you think he was waiting until he could make a big score out of it?

33:58.076 --> 34:02.600
No, I think in the past he was a friend.

34:03.962 --> 34:07.666
And he realized his moment.

34:08.486 --> 34:09.708
He realized his weakness.

34:09.888 --> 34:13.631
He came out of his room one day in the morning.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.173
He used to sleep till late.

34:16.030 --> 34:19.273
And he was involved heavily in drug activities in Detroit.

34:19.974 --> 34:25.859
And I'd taken him in and said, hey, let's go on the road together like we did in the old days.

34:25.879 --> 34:27.120
Look at that old 47 ship.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.402
Isn't that a dandy?

34:32.425 --> 34:38.390
But anyhow, he says, he came out of his room.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.991
He said, Steve, I'm so miserable.

34:40.051 --> 34:44.215
I sat up last night with a loaded gun, and I was going to blow my head off.

34:44.633 --> 34:46.075
He says, I don't know what I'm going to do.

34:46.135 --> 34:48.158
You're my last friend that I trust.

34:48.478 --> 34:57.891
His drug partner in crime at Frank Spaulding had just got busted flying some drugs up from Mexico.

34:57.931 --> 35:02.457
And they had a scam where two guys would get plane tickets and switch luggage.

35:02.517 --> 35:11.529
And then when they'd get up, the other guy would pick up the luggage and they'd got onto it and they'd caught him with the plane with the baggage tickets and arrested him.

35:11.589 --> 35:13.071
And Rhodes...

35:14.401 --> 35:18.526
had already gotten in some sort of a trouble connected with this drug ring.

35:21.851 --> 35:32.264
Frank was known and was supposed to give Rhodes like, I saw a payoff of $2,000 in cash in Frank's office.

35:32.284 --> 35:34.747
And Rhodes was already known.

35:34.807 --> 35:41.556
He'd been the middleman, collected Frank and the other people up with the individuals down by the Texas border that were bringing it up.

35:41.772 --> 35:46.760
You see, they'd get it in like a 300-pound cell for 900 pounds in Detroit and fly it up.

35:47.200 --> 35:52.669
Well, anyhow, Rhodes' cover was blown, so he wanted to come to Iowa and live with me and kick back.

35:53.330 --> 35:58.498
He'd just gotten divorced, too, and was losing custody of his kids, and that was an emotional strain.

35:58.748 --> 36:00.050
This bust was a strain.

36:00.391 --> 36:02.795
And he came to me and he said, Steve, can you take me in?

36:03.235 --> 36:07.322
Because I want to kick back, do antiques, remain anonymous.

36:07.362 --> 36:09.646
He said in his testimony that you asked him in.

36:09.686 --> 36:10.868
No, that's bullshit.

36:10.888 --> 36:11.730
It was the other way around.

36:11.750 --> 36:11.910
Yeah.

36:12.731 --> 36:17.058
And do antiques and sort of lay low until my lawyers can straighten this out.

36:18.100 --> 36:23.389
And then I'll try to get my life back together, you know.

36:24.162 --> 36:26.507
And I know this is a fact.

36:27.028 --> 36:28.712
Our investigators have brought this out.

36:28.732 --> 36:35.026
But the thing is, I guess the authorities got on him too heavy, and he had to trade me off.

36:35.046 --> 36:37.091
Plus, he needed a reward.

36:37.211 --> 36:38.293
Get $56K.

36:38.394 --> 36:38.654
Yeah.

36:39.296 --> 36:40.679
And he was looking for 10%.

36:41.160 --> 36:41.260
Yeah.

36:41.594 --> 36:43.776
20 million, which would have been 200,000.

36:43.997 --> 36:45.678
But he moved in with me.

36:45.698 --> 36:47.140
He moved all his stuff.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.642
I went over to his house and got his stuff.

36:48.662 --> 36:50.383
He moved a half a truckload of stuff.

36:50.724 --> 36:53.287
And when we went on the road, we sold a lot of that stuff.

36:53.307 --> 36:55.169
And he was getting short of stuff.

36:55.189 --> 36:58.872
And he was asking me, he wanted me to sell the Curtis books, for instance.

36:58.892 --> 37:01.315
He said he had a prospective buyer.

37:02.276 --> 37:03.798
And he wanted a percentage out of it.

37:04.438 --> 37:10.605
And here he lies up on the stand and says, I turned Bloomberg again because I was afraid of

37:11.328 --> 37:14.839
this loss of cultural stuff, you know.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.746
He wanted to see them go back to their wife alone.

37:16.806 --> 37:20.899
Yeah, no, he told me down in Canton, Texas.

37:22.060 --> 37:41.370
Three months before this came down that he had a Indian buyer that was interested in the Curtis stuff and he The Indian collector of Western Americana Indians and he wanted to act as a middleman to sell the Curtis books Did he say did he offer a figure?

37:41.390 --> 37:43.253
Did he suggest a figure?

37:43.273 --> 37:49.182
Well, he knew they were worth at least a hundred K and

37:51.322 --> 37:54.125
I don't know if he was trying to set me up at that point.

37:54.145 --> 37:58.451
He needed some money or if it was a legitimate thing.

37:58.511 --> 38:03.877
And he wanted to take one of the books and sell it and show it to him to verify it was there.

38:03.897 --> 38:19.776
In fact, he gave me a $20 and a $10 gold piece from this supposed collector that, you know, it was supposedly a wealthy collector he had met from Tennessee down there to show that was selling artifacts himself.

38:19.942 --> 38:45.713
that would buy rare things and wouldn't ask any questions and he like gave me a 20 to 10 dollar gold pieces upfront money he said well this collector's also got a large cache of gold coins and he gave me these coins to give to you to show that we could trade for gold coins and i said well that's awful nice of you but here's what they're working i gave roads the money

38:45.963 --> 39:09.692
back for the coins i said i appreciate the gesture and uh i wouldn't mind meeting the fellow i'm learning about his collections and that but i'm really not interested in selling even if the price was 100k no not at any price good and he'd uh he got on me for about a month and then he says well why don't we

39:10.246 --> 39:11.448
And he said, how'd you get them?

39:11.468 --> 39:16.575
And I said, well, I looked at the national list, union list, you know, and I know where they are.

39:16.595 --> 39:20.421
And he said, well, let's, could you take me over and show you, show me the list?

39:20.541 --> 39:21.723
Oh, this is Rose.

39:21.783 --> 39:23.526
Yeah, I'd like to find out where there's a set.

39:23.566 --> 39:26.610
Maybe I can get myself a set and sell him a set.

39:26.630 --> 39:33.641
And I went over to a library and we looked it up and they have like nine or 10 of them in the union list.

39:33.701 --> 39:35.143
There are nine or 10 of them.

39:35.303 --> 39:35.403
Yeah.

39:35.423 --> 39:39.409
And he wanted to know, he says, well, if you've been to some of these places, tell me.

39:39.794 --> 39:46.263
and tell me the security setup because, you know, if you're not going to sell yours, I'll get a set and I'll sell him mine.

39:46.463 --> 39:48.385
And he says, well, I don't know.

39:48.405 --> 39:51.990
You do what you want to do, but I don't really want to be part of it.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.572
I've got my set.

39:53.592 --> 39:58.399
So you never acquired duplicates, by the way, did you?

39:58.419 --> 40:01.383
On occasion, I did.

40:01.443 --> 40:03.365
That seems to be the ultimate.

40:03.385 --> 40:04.106
I read the book.

40:04.126 --> 40:05.548
That's the ultimate.

40:07.199 --> 40:10.082
symptom of bibliomania is to acquire a duplicate.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.225
I think A. Edward Newton said that.

40:12.385 --> 40:17.811
Yeah, well, you know, especially if it's a rarity, somebody else could probably get some research.

40:17.871 --> 40:19.193
Or a better copy.

40:19.493 --> 40:21.195
Yeah, well, moving up is fine.

40:21.215 --> 40:21.335
Yeah.

40:21.355 --> 40:21.876
Moving up.

40:21.996 --> 40:22.917
Yeah.

40:24.058 --> 40:24.779
How about condition?

40:24.819 --> 40:29.184
Did condition matter to you?

40:29.204 --> 40:30.085
Not that great.

40:33.372 --> 40:38.520
I can't see whether the thing is moving, but it is.

40:38.540 --> 40:40.444
But I try to keep them in good condition.

40:40.504 --> 40:44.550
Yeah, condition mattered as far as... Once you acquired it.

40:44.570 --> 40:48.997
Yeah, yeah, I didn't, I would feel terrible if the book was damaged.

40:49.538 --> 40:56.089
Do you think that any books, other than the things that have been described in the proceedings,

40:56.795 --> 41:02.001
Do you think any of the books got into worse condition once they came into your care?

41:02.081 --> 41:02.301
No.

41:02.321 --> 41:05.985
And did you always at least maintain?

41:06.005 --> 41:07.707
No, I always did.

41:07.727 --> 41:10.870
And if they needed the boards, they needed attaching, I'd have them bound.

41:11.351 --> 41:13.073
And then where did you send them out?

41:13.093 --> 41:14.494
Did you have the people who did it?

41:14.514 --> 41:15.375
I did it myself.

41:15.455 --> 41:16.056
Oh, you did.

41:16.076 --> 41:18.138
And I, yeah, I had some people that did it.

41:18.158 --> 41:20.260
I had a fellow in Amarillo.

41:20.281 --> 41:22.243
But you basically did your own conservation work.

41:22.263 --> 41:22.583
Yeah.

41:22.799 --> 41:31.669
Yeah, I oiled it with Deekswood oil or that other type of stuff.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.090
Yeah, I did a lot of my own work.

41:33.110 --> 41:36.294
Did you ever think of doing a catalog over here and stuff?

41:36.314 --> 41:38.376
Yeah, someday I was going to.

41:38.416 --> 41:40.758
My catalog, though, was in other catalogs.

41:40.859 --> 41:46.765
I take, like, the Evans collection or the Streeter collection, and I just put marks by the

41:47.960 --> 41:55.260
entries, and I knew which books I had by what I had in the Streeter collection.

41:55.280 --> 42:03.522
I could go through a big collection like the Streeter collection and just mark off, check off which books I had of that collection.

42:04.345 --> 42:07.791
And that's how I cataloged my collection, was through other collections.

42:07.812 --> 42:17.149
I used my bibliographies, like Henry Wagner's Spanish Southwest, or the Streeter Collection, or the... The Streeter Collection was quite extraordinary.

42:17.169 --> 42:17.910
Yeah, yeah.

42:17.931 --> 42:23.561
And I could look up my books through those books, through cross-referencing those books.

42:23.601 --> 42:25.645
That's how I cataloged my stuff.

42:26.789 --> 42:31.896
Of course, my architectural stuff, there isn't too much done yet.

42:31.916 --> 42:37.503
Hitchcock did a book on 19th century architectural books, but I didn't have much to index that by.

42:37.943 --> 42:49.659
But I used, for instance, Goodspeed's copy of fishing and that, and his thing on Daniel Fehring to catalog the fishing books.

42:53.163 --> 42:56.087
The Fehring collection at Harvard was superb.

42:56.725 --> 43:20.995
on fishing books i'm really not interested in fishing that much but i think daniel fearing as far as being a bibliophile of the 19th century from what i've seen of his stuff him and arthur or uh clark of cincinnati not arthur clark he was a bookseller in cleveland but uh there was also an earlier bookseller in the 80s in cincinnati

43:21.869 --> 43:50.340
who did reprints of, one of the first to do reprints of Valuable Americana, and his collection, which is at the University of Cincinnati, and the Cincinnati Historical Society, they were two of sort of the ultimate 19th century collectors, because they took their books, which were somewhat contemporary books at the time, and put them in fine findings and organized them, and Bering, I guess, had every thing that was available in print,

43:51.890 --> 43:58.223
on pectorology or fishing at the time, you know, up to 1910.

43:58.243 --> 44:00.588
These have a pretty distinctive minding, I think.

44:00.608 --> 44:00.869
Yeah.

44:00.969 --> 44:03.775
There's some green and... Yeah, green and red.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.418
Green and red, yeah.

44:05.438 --> 44:05.558
Yeah.

44:05.598 --> 44:07.823
Which made it... The green ones were...

44:08.073 --> 44:09.595
domestically published.

44:09.615 --> 44:12.238
The red ones were foreign published.

44:12.258 --> 44:18.005
I just guessed that I hadn't read from what I'd seen in the Harvard Library and how they would classify it.

44:18.125 --> 44:22.350
I didn't even think they knew they were gone, by the way, until they were invited out to see them.

44:22.370 --> 44:23.131
Yeah, that's the thing.

44:23.171 --> 44:32.562
A lot of this material, it's good that it's there, but most of it is unknown, even by the people that have it, or unknown in the context.

44:33.043 --> 44:37.708
For instance, I'd like to do a bibliography of 19th century view books, because I've collected

44:38.060 --> 44:45.909
Most of my view books that I have, I've collected by just acquiring them in the antique shops and so forth.

44:46.289 --> 44:47.510
There's really no collection.

44:47.530 --> 44:48.451
Is it a stereoptic view?

44:48.471 --> 44:53.877
No, the little view books, they're pre-postcard with the brown and white lithotons that molded out.

44:54.138 --> 45:00.244
There were a number of publishers years ago, Adolph Wittemann, Albertite did photogravure things.

45:00.825 --> 45:03.628
They were sold by souvenir companies.

45:04.047 --> 45:06.309
cities in the late 19th century.

45:06.389 --> 45:10.453
H. Nelson of Portland, Maine.

45:11.354 --> 45:15.859
You look in the back of some of them, they'll have a listing of the different views of different cities.

45:15.959 --> 45:21.164
They were view book publishers.

45:21.184 --> 45:24.047
And I collected those because, you see, I'd have them with me.

45:24.067 --> 45:33.396
And when I'd go through different cities of the 19th that were in existence in the 19th century and I had a view book, I'd always drive around, look for the views and the spots.

45:33.848 --> 45:55.300
you know like fourth and main or the first national bank or the president of the banks residence or whatever did you uh as it is now compared to as it was in the view book did you have any remorse at all did you feel that you would

45:56.191 --> 46:18.688
taking something valuable from somebody else yeah i felt if there were somebody else i did have quite a bit of remorse i felt if there was somebody else just like me who was who maybe would have been unknown but yet would have had the insight into finding these materials they wouldn't be there for them and i felt i had to get these

46:20.018 --> 46:24.023
back or to be made accessible to other people in some way.

46:24.283 --> 46:28.628
How would you have done that in your own mind?

46:29.449 --> 46:36.097
Well, I was going to bestow the knowledge to as many people as I can or have people in to see them while I was alive.

46:36.117 --> 46:37.599
How were you going to do that?

46:37.899 --> 46:44.367
Well, when I died, I was going to leave at my will a confession and a trust to do this.

46:45.208 --> 46:47.511
That's why I say I'm sort of living my death.

46:52.115 --> 46:59.008
How did you enjoy your collection?

46:59.028 --> 47:00.992
I saw some photos in the file of the course.

47:01.332 --> 47:06.101
Mostly bringing people up to see it, like I'm showing you my house for Tumba.

47:06.121 --> 47:10.309
You're going to see the skeleton of my life, you know.

47:11.251 --> 47:12.893
The empty shelves.

47:13.373 --> 47:14.994
When's the last time you were down here?

47:15.015 --> 47:15.355
A week ago.

47:15.575 --> 47:21.961
This is probably going to be the last time I'm going to be able to come here because I'm gone for an extended period of time.

47:21.981 --> 47:24.203
The house will probably.

47:24.383 --> 47:24.924
Mr. Hall will die.

47:24.944 --> 47:26.285
I'll call him disrepair.

47:27.326 --> 47:31.049
Maybe get torn down for a parking lot, the ever classic.

47:31.070 --> 47:33.372
Now, I understand your father's coming in.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.513
Today, yeah.

47:34.573 --> 47:35.914
Testifying.

47:35.934 --> 47:37.315
Did he know about your collecting?

47:37.335 --> 47:37.936
Well, he knew.

47:38.416 --> 47:40.178
Yeah, I knew about the collecting.

47:40.462 --> 47:44.789
He fixed his obsession, but no, I didn't know about any of the other stuff.

47:44.809 --> 47:46.813
Any of the means, shall we say?

47:46.953 --> 47:51.461
Of course, I spent an awful lot of money on the majority of the stuff I bought.

47:51.721 --> 47:55.548
Yeah, I think there's a point that hasn't come out, you know, and I'd like to make that.

47:56.670 --> 47:57.832
I would like to ask you that.

47:57.932 --> 48:02.901
They say they recovered in excess of 20,000 books and manuscripts.

48:02.921 --> 48:03.702
Yeah, absolutely.

48:05.251 --> 48:14.120
But they haven't distinguished between how many were purchased legitimately by yourself and those obtained otherwise.

48:14.280 --> 48:19.446
And as you know, in the antiquarian market, there's a lot of ex-library stuff out there.

48:19.626 --> 48:20.747
Ex-libris stuff.

48:21.248 --> 48:21.788
Ex-libris, yeah.

48:21.808 --> 48:22.889
A lot of tomes.

48:23.030 --> 48:23.490
That's right.

48:23.550 --> 48:24.331
So give me an idea.

48:24.351 --> 48:25.732
Give me an idea of the numbers.

48:25.752 --> 48:26.894
Well, go in any bookstore.

48:26.914 --> 48:27.474
Well, it depends.

48:27.755 --> 48:32.980
I mean, in your collection, the numbers that were purchased, that acquired

48:33.112 --> 48:43.362
You know, since these moves out of Elliott Avenue, I haven't gotten my whole collection out.

48:43.382 --> 48:54.694
And most of the stuff that, the earlier stuff that I acquired hadn't been unpacked yet.

48:54.714 --> 48:56.615
Now, did they?

48:56.635 --> 49:00.579
Oh, I'd say easily 50% or even more.

49:00.860 --> 49:02.241
How much would you say you spent?

49:02.693 --> 49:06.398
Over the years, a book collection.

49:07.761 --> 49:08.562
Did you have a rough idea?

49:08.582 --> 49:09.062
$100,000.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.189
I bought and bought.

49:13.209 --> 49:16.534
It adds up, you know, $20 here, $30 there.

49:17.715 --> 49:19.939
Did you ever go hungry?

49:19.979 --> 49:22.102
Would you choose to have a book or a meal?

49:22.122 --> 49:23.604
No, I'd have read after a book.

49:24.105 --> 49:24.966
Any day of the year?

49:25.947 --> 49:26.789
Yeah.

49:26.809 --> 49:27.590
Let the record show.

49:27.610 --> 49:29.713
He's smiling broadly at that question.

49:32.393 --> 49:34.957
Did you, in fact, ever go hungry?

49:35.598 --> 49:37.040
Well, yeah, I haven't had breakfast yet.

49:38.723 --> 49:43.671
But why don't we stop in one of these towns and go into a fine little ma and pa restaurant?

49:43.711 --> 49:44.472
Have you guys eaten?

49:45.453 --> 49:46.114
I knew that.

49:46.635 --> 49:52.565
Nobody should be hungry in the land of plenty.

49:52.585 --> 49:53.606
Dinner's on me, huh?

49:53.706 --> 49:55.509
Or breakfast, shall we call it.

49:55.529 --> 49:55.930
All right.

49:56.150 --> 49:56.971
You hungry, Adam?

49:57.813 --> 49:58.654
Have you ate yet?

49:59.309 --> 50:03.215
No, we're going to have more than bacon.

50:03.335 --> 50:05.458
We're going to have a good meal.

50:05.498 --> 50:06.560
Have you ate one?

50:06.580 --> 50:08.322
Oh, okay.

50:08.542 --> 50:10.806
We're going to eat.

50:10.826 --> 50:12.789
I always fed my people, you know.

50:12.809 --> 50:13.129
You did?

50:13.550 --> 50:13.730
Yeah.

50:14.531 --> 50:16.114
Many of my friends were hungry.

50:16.134 --> 50:21.582
I thought those young fellas that testified, they looked heartbroken up there being forced to do that.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.424
Yeah, I've known them.

50:23.444 --> 50:26.008
I've known either their folks or them since they were...

50:27.642 --> 50:32.191
One fellow waiting outside for you, he wanted so desperately to talk to you.

50:32.371 --> 50:34.575
And you could tell, he was angry.

50:34.595 --> 50:36.900
They had him by the short hairs.

50:37.140 --> 50:42.090
I've known those guys for 10 years.

50:46.441 --> 50:48.123
Beautiful country, huh?

50:49.244 --> 50:49.684
Yeah, yeah.

50:49.904 --> 50:54.288
That's another thing that strikes my curiosity is that you know a lot about American history.

50:54.468 --> 51:04.617
And a lot of my family backgrounds from Seymour, Iowa, where Jesse James had robbed the bank down there.

51:04.737 --> 51:11.043
My grandmother used to own a 100-room hotel, and the railroad used to ride across the front of her property.

51:11.083 --> 51:16.448
They had to pay her to run the train across her property.

51:16.867 --> 51:18.870
every time they went across her property.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.094
And she had all kinds of old artifacts or anything.

51:22.194 --> 51:26.640
And a lot of that stuff got lost or just got left behind.

51:26.660 --> 51:38.756
And if there had been just somebody that would have been there to get it and to take it somewhere where it would have been safe and just watch over it, we'd still have those things to this day.

51:39.036 --> 51:44.123
They wouldn't be maybe in the city dump somewhere 400 feet under the ground.

51:44.491 --> 51:45.332
Did you ever get any?

51:45.712 --> 51:50.818
You know, I know people that have found very valuable things in the dump.

51:50.838 --> 51:52.660
Have you ever gone to dumps looking for things?

51:52.861 --> 52:06.897
Well, you can't in Minneapolis because there's so much machinery and that going and they just are bulldozing it over that you can't go to the dump, per se, but in these neighborhoods like East Des Moines, you know what the dump is?

52:06.937 --> 52:08.619
You know where people throw their stuff?

52:08.659 --> 52:09.220
On the street.

52:09.560 --> 52:12.203
Either on the street corner or in empty buildings.

52:13.162 --> 52:38.123
if you get into boston or new york or something you'll find that any building that's been boarded up and opened up and there are open knockout windows at street level you'll find them filled with garbage and that the empty buildings are the dumps of the inner city neighborhoods vacant buildings and also the treasure troves that's where you'll find the painted over

52:38.693 --> 52:45.165
Russell and Erwin hardware of the 1870s, and under the floorboards, the coins.

52:45.285 --> 52:46.548
You look under the floorboards?

52:46.668 --> 52:46.989
Oh, yeah.

52:47.029 --> 52:48.652
Did you usually find things there?

52:48.932 --> 52:49.032
Yeah.

52:49.052 --> 52:49.694
Often, shall we say?

52:49.714 --> 52:50.074
Oh, yeah.

52:50.094 --> 52:56.847
Behind radiators and bathtubs and heat register grades.

52:56.867 --> 52:57.969
I'm enjoying this ride.

52:58.470 --> 52:58.991
Oh, great.

52:59.091 --> 53:01.396
Yeah, I'm enjoying your company, too.

53:01.496 --> 53:01.596
Yeah.

53:02.588 --> 53:04.110
We can do this any way you want.

53:04.331 --> 53:11.702
If you feel at all guilty about telling about, if you feel you have to tell your lawyer and Ray that you're with me, that's up to you.

53:12.363 --> 53:15.788
But otherwise, it's between you and me and the kids in the backseat.

53:15.808 --> 53:16.269
It's up to you.

53:18.833 --> 53:21.356
I just think that while these people... I still trust people.

53:21.396 --> 53:24.120
I don't care how much of a snake Rhodes is.

53:24.882 --> 53:27.786
Yeah, but I don't want... I trusted him.

53:28.222 --> 53:28.923
That was something.

53:28.943 --> 53:33.306
You know, when I heard them play that tape, because I've been their newsman for 20 years.

53:35.128 --> 53:36.149
And I had a big story.

53:36.169 --> 53:37.610
I don't need this on the tape.

53:37.630 --> 53:38.811
What did you say about Dwayne?

53:39.952 --> 53:41.974
Oh, that Rhodes.

53:41.994 --> 53:48.520
Dwayne got in late one night when he taped us, and he was waking up with a hangover.

53:49.160 --> 53:52.443
And he taped Dwayne, you know.

53:52.463 --> 53:53.324
I don't know.

53:53.344 --> 53:55.006
That's when he was on the tape.

53:55.046 --> 53:57.688
I feel bad because I took Dwayne over there, and

53:58.023 --> 54:05.193
It was really to get me, and I hate to see innocent people get got because of me, you know.

54:05.514 --> 54:06.295
The classifier.

54:06.515 --> 54:06.695
Yeah.

54:10.461 --> 54:10.621
Yeah.

54:10.641 --> 54:16.049
Do you think they were on to you for a while, though, or do you think that you would still have your collection if it went for Kenny Rhodes?

54:19.113 --> 54:27.405
Oh, they were on to me, but I quit certain aspects of my...

54:29.596 --> 54:36.482
collecting by and large in certain parts of it.

54:36.502 --> 54:53.517
Except I broke down just that last time I was going to Texas and Rhodes told me when I was going down there, all you ought to, if you're going down to Texas and you ever get to Houston, you ought to go back to Rice University like you and I did, you know.

54:53.537 --> 54:58.962
That's, I kind of, I kind of,

54:59.212 --> 55:03.116
Went back there for nostalgic purposes, and then I sent him a letter.

55:04.217 --> 55:07.220
Of course, that was the infamous letter, you know.

55:07.240 --> 55:07.921
I don't know about that.

55:08.281 --> 55:10.324
That hasn't been entered, has it?

55:10.344 --> 55:11.325
I don't know if it hasn't.

55:11.345 --> 55:14.428
I wrote him a letter from Rice University where he and I had gone.

55:14.448 --> 55:15.189
You shouldn't have done that.

55:16.070 --> 55:17.011
What did you say in the letter?

55:17.871 --> 55:20.734
Oh, that I'd made a visit like he and I had.

55:20.995 --> 55:26.080
He'd requested that I. So he was setting you up all at every step of the way.

55:29.317 --> 55:29.998
How do you feel?

55:30.098 --> 55:37.269
I mean, what does that do about your feeling, your faith in human nature?

55:37.630 --> 55:40.154
Well, I'm not going to lose it.

55:40.174 --> 55:42.578
I'm going to keep trusting people like I trust you, you know.

55:43.439 --> 55:52.934
But as far as an agent of the US government and their action, it doesn't surprise me.

55:52.954 --> 55:54.036
It doesn't surprise me.

55:54.396 --> 55:56.860
They got to him.

55:57.245 --> 56:01.329
$56,000 in my friendship was his price.

56:03.591 --> 56:05.672
I wouldn't betray Adam for any amount of money.

56:05.732 --> 56:11.077
I wouldn't rat on Adam if they said, hey, Steve, we'll give your books back and let you go.

56:11.117 --> 56:20.105
If I'd known Adam had done something illegal or harmful, I'd say, well, Adam, you might get busted or maybe this isn't good for you or whatever.

56:20.826 --> 56:23.348
But I wouldn't rat on him to get out.

56:23.468 --> 56:25.750
You know, if they said, Steve, we'll give you your books back,

56:25.966 --> 56:28.750
We'll give your money back and let you go, but you give us Adam.

56:28.770 --> 56:29.612
We know he'd done this.

56:29.652 --> 56:30.112
We've done that.

56:30.132 --> 56:31.935
I wouldn't do it.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.197
Adam has given me one thing.

56:33.217 --> 56:34.219
He's given me his friendship.

56:34.259 --> 56:35.441
That's worth more than anything.

56:36.142 --> 56:37.404
You can't put a price on that.

56:38.846 --> 56:42.892
I'll make new friends if I go to prison and so forth.

56:42.972 --> 56:44.194
I'll get things in there.

56:44.731 --> 56:49.857
from some of those prisoners, as friendship, there are some good people in there.

56:49.877 --> 56:50.598
And I'll get that.

56:50.738 --> 56:56.425
And their friendship is more precious, like Adam's friendship, than any price, or even than freedom, you know?

56:57.046 --> 56:58.808
You don't rat on people.

56:59.469 --> 57:00.771
You don't betray friendship.

57:00.791 --> 57:02.473
Nobody likes a snitch.

57:02.493 --> 57:05.176
I don't care.

57:05.196 --> 57:08.120
Even the government deep down inside knows.

57:09.902 --> 57:12.385
Like they say, when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.

57:12.826 --> 57:13.827
Yeah.

57:16.220 --> 57:21.546
I know another collector who lives up in Elgin, Oregon.

57:21.566 --> 57:23.968
His name is Sam Forall.

57:23.988 --> 57:30.195
And he's an old mountaineer man with a hair lip, wears a sidearm on his hip.

57:30.215 --> 57:35.280
He owns a bunch of property up there, and he has a collection of old cars like you wouldn't believe.

57:35.300 --> 57:45.771
It looks like a menagerie of junk old antique cars that go way back to the pioneer days, back when his family, his descendants,

57:46.088 --> 57:52.555
And he has rifles, an old fire truck, fire engine.

57:52.575 --> 58:03.586
And he just, he lives up there in the peaceful serenity of the mountains and enjoys everything he has and enjoys life, really lives life to the fullest.

58:03.606 --> 58:05.147
And that's what I believe.

58:05.167 --> 58:06.449
People are curious of that.

58:06.469 --> 58:15.758
You want to live life to the fullest and get as much knowledge as you possibly can and then provide that knowledge to everyone else in the world.

58:16.160 --> 58:22.592
I'll bet you that guy in Oregon's got the same attitude, don't he?

58:22.612 --> 58:24.836
You go into his place, he likes to show his cars.

58:24.856 --> 58:25.958
He'll show you everything.

58:25.998 --> 58:28.824
He'll let you fire his old buskets.

58:29.144 --> 58:31.148
He'll take you for help.

58:31.432 --> 58:41.727
take you up the mountain and show you old abandoned gold mines.

58:41.747 --> 58:50.380
I mean, I went fishing with him one day when I was only about 13, 14 years old when I lived up in Ellison, Oregon in the mountains.

58:50.400 --> 58:51.922
My father got this wild hair when he seemed older in his family.

58:51.942 --> 58:55.908
He wanted to get some government property and we were going to homestead up in the mountains.

58:55.928 --> 58:57.490
We met Sam Correll.

58:58.128 --> 59:00.670
And he took me fishing one day.

59:00.690 --> 59:04.093
We were sitting along the mountain stream fishing for trout.

59:05.074 --> 59:08.817
And he just jumped up with his pistol and fired it.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.119
And he blew a hell of a rattler.

59:11.279 --> 59:13.181
I mean, not more than probably five or six feet.

59:13.201 --> 59:14.562
And he was just a little fitty.

59:14.582 --> 59:17.645
Because them little fitty ones can get you just as good as them bacon.

59:17.665 --> 59:19.006
Oh, yeah.

59:19.026 --> 59:19.366
Yeah.

59:19.386 --> 59:22.689
Just a happy-go-lucky guy.

59:22.989 --> 59:23.830
Mountaineer man.

59:24.631 --> 59:27.173
His wife, she's so old-fashioned.

59:27.760 --> 59:37.315
She'd go out in Splitwood.

59:37.335 --> 59:46.328
Go out, you know, just pioneer woman all the way.

59:46.348 --> 59:46.609
Good as gold.

59:46.629 --> 59:49.173
They'd invite anybody that was bad, that was in peril, you know, that didn't have any food or a place to live.

59:49.193 --> 59:49.593
He'd invite them in.

59:49.613 --> 59:51.496
He'd get them into a place and property that he owned.

59:51.516 --> 59:52.438
They wouldn't let them get back on their feet.

59:52.458 --> 59:54.100
I used to do that with that house in Otomo.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.843
I took Kenny Rhodes, and he was...

59:56.296 --> 01:00:16.870
up against it or he told me he was up against it and uh mr hall and i used to these young people you know when they would get fights you know their wives and their girlfriends would throw them out or they'd have problems oh i knew a kid named billy laquay and his brother

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:20.875
He's in a gang called the Naturals in Minneapolis.

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:22.718
He's an Indian and Native American.

01:00:22.738 --> 01:00:23.720
They have a gang called the Naturals.

01:00:23.961 --> 01:00:24.902
What's his name?

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:25.864
Billy Laquay.

01:00:26.305 --> 01:00:34.740
And his brother knifed a guy from a rival gang from another Indian family.

01:00:35.328 --> 01:00:38.812
So they put out a contract like on Billy and his mother.

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.273
That's all that were left.

01:00:40.293 --> 01:00:43.677
He's got some sisters, but they're not living in the immediate proximity.

01:00:43.977 --> 01:00:45.318
Billy was scared for his life.

01:00:45.618 --> 01:00:54.728
So I brought him down to Otumwa to live in this day with me for a while, just sort of him and David Olson, just sort of as a refuge out of the city.

01:00:54.768 --> 01:01:04.778
And those guys, those boys you've seen testifying, they used to the joblessness and having to give their blood to get enough money for gas and that.

01:01:05.281 --> 01:01:13.553
That would get to them after a while, and they used to like to come on the road with me or come down here to Ottumwa just for a few days just to get away from it all, you know.

01:01:13.573 --> 01:01:16.578
So my house was sort of a refuge.

01:01:16.738 --> 01:01:17.740
Are you going to sell the house?

01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:22.667
Well, I don't want to because I want to have a place to go after this is all.

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:26.833
And inflation will get so bad that by the time I'm done, I won't...

01:01:27.168 --> 01:01:28.410
be able to afford any place.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.613
You know what they are in New England and they're what they were.

01:01:31.033 --> 01:01:35.760
I got this house for $16,000 and it's a 17-room house and it's paid for.

01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:37.342
I got a place.

01:01:37.523 --> 01:01:41.048
And when did you get, when did you buy it?

01:01:41.068 --> 01:01:41.348
88.

01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:45.514
I'm going to just put this on the other side.
