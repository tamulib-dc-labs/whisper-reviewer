WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:05.681
Let's go back to Jim in Canton, Ohio.

00:06.142 --> 00:12.291
You were talking about publishing electronically and the taxes on that, Jim.

00:12.371 --> 00:16.057
What was the point you wanted to bring up with Nicholas?

00:16.077 --> 00:17.740
No, well, you confused the point.

00:17.860 --> 00:18.361
I'm sorry.

00:18.401 --> 00:19.462
That's all right.

00:19.723 --> 00:28.857
Just to briefly reprise, when I decided to publish my own memoir before I go with Ex Libris, which is Random House's on-demand electronic publishing service,

00:29.680 --> 00:34.685
You know, the tax laws kept people from holding back lists, the bookstores and the suppliers.

00:35.066 --> 00:38.029
Well, what I'm getting at is, is this a middle way?

00:38.069 --> 00:45.677
In other words, X copies of my memoir will be out there, and family, friends, colleagues, and so forth, and maybe the local newspaper will push a few.

00:46.057 --> 00:58.270
But in addition to that, the fact that the book is in an online format, doesn't that kind of obviate all of the various floppy disks, DVDs, softwares, memory cards problems?

00:58.655 --> 01:02.787
What you mean is by making a print-on-demand hard copy, is that what you're saying?

01:03.007 --> 01:03.829
Yeah.

01:03.970 --> 01:11.752
Well, it certainly works to keep a book in print, and that's one of the arguments that the publishing industry puts out for holding copyrights.

01:11.792 --> 01:13.677
A lot of authors like myself...

01:13.657 --> 01:39.512
are concerned that this is one way a publisher can say well your book is still in print even even if it's not well and when somebody might request an on-demand copy they can produce a paperback version and that's kind of coming and i'm kind of i i have to confess i'm ambivalent on the subject i'm all for staying in print one way or another but i'm also for trying to find a new life for you for your material if your previous publisher's not interested in it i don't know if that's kind of the answer you're looking for

01:39.779 --> 01:46.587
But I do believe that it's a very interesting frontier, print-on-demand, because it does give us a hard copy of the book.

01:46.907 --> 01:57.539
Here's a caller, David, who says he's a little disturbed by the fact that you have 15,000 books, many of which are in storage.

01:58.120 --> 02:03.045
He says, I make it a point to keep my personal library minimal.

02:03.586 --> 02:07.170
Rather, I resell my books on Amazon...

02:07.336 --> 02:11.283
and other venues to keep them moving, keep them circulating.

02:11.844 --> 02:21.059
I think that's better than boxing them unless they are rare books that would otherwise be lost to the world.

02:21.079 --> 02:25.827
Well, I think that's wonderful that you're circulating your books, that you're finding a new home for them.

02:26.388 --> 02:28.632
Again, as I said, I'm rescuing a lot of these books.

02:28.692 --> 02:32.078
These are two steps away from the pulping plant.

02:32.480 --> 02:39.150
And these are low-usage books that I have in storage, and I can assure you none of them are rarities, but the practical fact of the matter is I have no room.

02:40.572 --> 02:42.595
So they have to be in storage?

02:42.976 --> 02:46.681
Some of these books, we're not talking about great rarities in storage.

02:46.701 --> 02:49.545
We're just talking about books that I'm giving a new lease on life.

02:50.326 --> 02:54.032
To Detroit, Michigan, and to Mike, good morning to you.

02:55.154 --> 03:00.141
Hey, I guess my question is that I have read somewhere

03:00.526 --> 03:09.560
that in the times of Asia, Asia, Egypt, and also during the times of election of the great, there were multiple libraries that were burned in Egypt.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.381
And I'm wondering.

03:12.224 --> 03:12.785
Oh, dear.

03:13.826 --> 03:14.347
I'm afraid.

03:14.567 --> 03:15.649
Are you there, Mike?

03:15.669 --> 03:17.071
He was getting to the point of a good question.

03:17.151 --> 03:18.854
Yeah, I thought so, too.

03:19.014 --> 03:20.717
Let's see if I can.

03:21.378 --> 03:28.288
How did destruction of Egypt affect African civilizations?

03:29.770 --> 03:31.312
I don't have a good answer for that.

03:31.372 --> 03:36.980
I mean, Alexandria was in Egypt, of course, but I'm not so sure if that's the library that he's talking about.

03:37.200 --> 03:53.061
Alexandria was destroyed, and apparently on multiple occasions, and I don't want to get into the politics of that one, but we certainly know what was lost there, a great store of classical knowledge which was considered pagan by both Christians and Muslims.

03:53.412 --> 03:58.782
But I think the thrust of his question was other libraries that might have been in other parts of Africa.

03:58.822 --> 04:02.007
The Timbuktu, for instance, was a legendary library there.

04:02.769 --> 04:10.483
And if all the stories you read about that are true, then yes, of course, it would have severely impacted African culture had it been destroyed.

04:10.843 --> 04:11.124
All right.

04:11.204 --> 04:13.769
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

04:13.869 --> 04:14.911
Good morning, Paula.

04:15.231 --> 04:15.752
Good morning.

04:15.792 --> 04:16.473
How are you today?

04:16.554 --> 04:17.395
Fine, thanks.

04:17.645 --> 04:20.689
It's a pleasure listening to your show today every day.

04:20.709 --> 04:21.550
Thank you.

04:21.811 --> 04:26.678
But I must tell your guest there this morning that I have to thank him.

04:26.838 --> 04:28.961
You've made me feel so much better about myself today.

04:28.981 --> 04:29.361
Thank you, Paula.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.826
Because I am an avid cookbook collector.

04:33.347 --> 04:34.308
I'm a chef also.

04:34.328 --> 04:43.061
And my friends and my family have teased me terribly because about three years ago I finally stopped keeping count when I hit about 650 cookbooks.

04:44.102 --> 04:47.567
And I have rescued cookbooks I have been going back into the early 1900s

04:48.374 --> 04:52.960
And my friends are quite fascinated with my collection, but people are like, what do you mean you bought another cookbook?

04:54.081 --> 04:58.106
How many of them are in active use, Paula?

04:58.266 --> 04:58.647
For me?

04:59.448 --> 05:02.331
Well, first off, I've read every one of them that I've had.

05:02.351 --> 05:02.932
Oh, good.

05:03.032 --> 05:03.873
They're fun to read.

05:03.913 --> 05:08.479
One of the few collectors I've ever heard or met that has actually read every book in your collection.

05:08.499 --> 05:09.600
Yeah, it's wonderful.

05:09.620 --> 05:13.305
Well, you know, and as far as active use, I do a lot of culinary research.

05:13.365 --> 05:14.126
It's my hobby.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.609
I like to say my hobby is culinary anthropology.

05:16.910 --> 05:20.636
I actually found out that Boston University started offering a... I'm writing that down, by the way.

05:20.656 --> 05:20.876
Go ahead.

05:20.936 --> 05:22.118
Culinary anthropology.

05:22.158 --> 05:22.619
That's a good one.

05:22.639 --> 05:41.449
Well, and I've had a wonderful... Through my own context, I've been able to discuss my theories and such with some people from the Smithsonian who have agreed with my theories on civilizations and food and how impacted civilization has been by the food supply, and as the food supply got better, the civilization moved forward.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.963
And I've done a lot of research to this point.

05:45.244 --> 05:49.363
Well, maybe you're ready to write your own book, don't you think?

05:49.681 --> 05:51.744
I have been working on a couple proposals, as it is.

05:52.125 --> 05:52.706
Good.

05:52.726 --> 05:58.395
Paula, read in my book, A Gentle Madness, about Chef Louis Zafmary, S-C-A-T-H-M-A-R-Y.

05:59.076 --> 06:13.478
He was a chef in Chicago, and he had 250,000 culinary artifacts, not just books, but artifacts, which now are the principal reference materials at no fewer than six major institutions, Johnson & Wales and the

06:13.458 --> 06:17.225
In Rhode Island, the University of Iowa has his antiquarian cookbooks.

06:17.506 --> 06:18.608
A fascinating guy.

06:18.928 --> 06:27.284
I don't remember how many tractor trailers it took to move the stuff from Chicago to Rhode Island, but it was like 200,000 objects.

06:27.404 --> 06:28.526
Good luck to you, Paula.

06:28.546 --> 06:29.087
Good luck, Paula.

06:29.107 --> 06:29.829
Thanks for the call.

06:29.849 --> 06:33.255
Nicholas, you need four needs.

06:33.488 --> 06:46.927
I need to hear you talk about your own background, about your own childhood, about your own interest in books, and how it became as intense as it is now.

06:47.788 --> 06:54.417
When I was appointed literary editor of the Worcester, Massachusetts Sunday Telegram in 1978,

06:54.397 --> 07:02.028
I said, what a wonderful opportunity it would be to just indulge my obsession, which is for books, to continue a liberal arts education.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.411
But what happened as a kid?

07:04.671 --> 07:06.394
I mean, what were you doing then?

07:06.454 --> 07:12.202
My dear mother said, I've been talking about writing a book from the time I could start to read.

07:12.402 --> 07:14.565
Really?

07:14.545 --> 07:34.090
copying in a notebook the the iliad and she said what are you doing i said i'm writing a book she said well that's not really exactly how we do it but but but you know but isn't that the way artists begin by copying the great artists well but i wanted to to produce something i i had an old roommate when i was uh in the navy a

07:34.070 --> 07:40.057
on an aircraft carrier, and a good friend of mine, Gene Hester, out in California, and he reminded me, we were out in L.A.

07:40.097 --> 07:56.635
together a couple weeks ago, he said, you know, you always said when we were bouncing around in the Pacific Ocean on that aircraft carrier, Gene, I'm going to write a book, I'm going to write a book, and I have to say, you and I, Diane, were talking between, at one of the breaks, you have 15,000 inscribed books,

07:56.615 --> 08:00.742
that have been presented to you in this program, and they're now at McDaniel College in Westminster.

08:01.283 --> 08:04.469
I have a similar kind of alchemy work with me.

08:04.950 --> 08:11.642
When I was the literary editor for the Worcester Telegram and Gazette, I used to do a weekly interview with authors, and I would go to Boston.

08:11.762 --> 08:17.593
And over a period of 22 years, because when I left the paper, I continued to do this freelance...

08:17.573 --> 08:22.544
I would always end the interview by asking the author to inscribe a book for me.

08:22.964 --> 08:28.015
And then I kind of crossed the line, you know, when I was interviewing Joseph Heller, for instance.

08:28.436 --> 08:30.721
It wasn't enough to do the novel God Knows.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.805
I had to have a catch-22 with me.

08:33.286 --> 08:36.714
I remember he said to me, too bad you don't have a catch-22 in Dusty.

08:36.754 --> 08:37.776
Well, I did.

08:37.756 --> 08:48.114
And he wrote in it, and I've said this before, for Nick Basbanes, who treasures his first editions, I only wish I had a first edition copy of this book, you know, and it was a cute little story.

08:48.134 --> 08:54.145
But that kind of helped me cross the line from being a writer about books and book culture to being...

08:54.125 --> 09:19.947
passionate about the artifact and collecting but to answer your question I've always I can't remember a time when I haven't loved books and I was asked the other day do you take a book with you everywhere I mean except to the post office but any place where I'm I expect to have to be more than 30 minutes like the doctor or the dentist or the barbershop you take a book absolutely let's go to Silver Spring Maryland good morning Alexandra

09:20.045 --> 09:20.606
Good morning.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.689
This has been such a pleasure to listen to.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.450
Oh, good.

09:23.670 --> 09:28.718
I have so many comments now, but the one I called about actually brings us back to earlier in the conversation.

09:28.738 --> 09:34.446
Mr. Beth Baines, you were talking about your daughters and your collection and how they feel about your collection.

09:34.526 --> 09:40.615
And I, in the last few years, saw both of my parents, and my father was a writer.

09:41.676 --> 09:45.241
He was William H. White, and he wrote The Organization Man and then some other things after that.

09:46.143 --> 09:46.423
Excellent.

09:47.028 --> 09:51.734
And so he was an avid reader and collector of books.

09:51.754 --> 10:00.064
And so I was faced with, his collection was not nearly as big as yours, but I was faced with a collection of 3,000 plus or minus books.

10:00.304 --> 10:01.185
By choice books, Alba.

10:01.205 --> 10:02.787
I needed to figure out what to do with.

10:03.368 --> 10:09.475
And I just wanted to sort of make the comment that any people out there who are avid book collectors,

10:10.096 --> 10:17.568
for them to think about that, what their loved ones, what they would like their loved ones to do with their collections, because I was really faced with it.

10:17.588 --> 10:19.011
That's an excellent point.

10:19.091 --> 10:21.294
And Diane, of course, what have you done with your books?

10:21.695 --> 10:30.990
Well, I wanted to pass them on to young people who would have the opportunity to hold in their hands.

10:30.970 --> 10:32.011
a signed book.

10:32.031 --> 10:36.335
But you've also given them to an institution where everyone can have access to them.

10:36.355 --> 10:40.939
So what Diane has done with her books is almost a perfect answer to the point that you raise.

10:41.339 --> 10:41.960
Yeah, absolutely.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.222
I thank you for calling, Alexandra.

10:44.422 --> 10:45.002
Have a nice day.

10:45.022 --> 10:45.623
Thank you.

10:46.143 --> 10:51.248
At six minutes before the hour, you're listening to The Diane Rehm Show.

10:53.130 --> 10:56.052
And to San Antonio, Texas.

10:56.473 --> 10:57.694
Good morning, Rebecca.

10:57.874 --> 10:58.615
Good morning.

10:58.835 --> 10:59.155
Hi.

10:59.422 --> 11:16.603
One of my favorite books as both a youngster and as an adult now is Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, which I think is the ultimate combination of a totalitarian society that focuses on burning all books.

11:17.665 --> 11:27.437
And in the book, people memorize books in order to save them from burning so that at least the book survives and they hide themselves away from the

11:27.670 --> 11:31.441
firemen and memorize a book and they become known as that book.

11:32.123 --> 11:40.667
And I was just wondering what you, Diane, and you, Nicholas, might choose to be if you were in a position like that.

11:41.525 --> 11:43.629
I have a hard time deciding what I would do.

11:43.649 --> 11:44.630
Well, I'll take it instantly.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.914
It's the works of William Shakespeare.

11:48.437 --> 11:59.175
If I were responsible for preserving one book and I had one to choose, it would have to be the 36 plays that you find in the first folio of Shakespeare.

11:59.536 --> 12:00.377
That would be mine.

12:00.357 --> 12:08.930
I'd probably, if I had one book to choose, would choose the King James Version of the Bible.

12:08.950 --> 12:11.213
I was just going to say that was going to be my second choice.

12:12.094 --> 12:14.378
I was about to even say it before you said it.

12:14.558 --> 12:14.999
Good for you.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.381
Those are the two, though.

12:16.421 --> 12:18.424
I think if we take those two, you're pretty well set.

12:18.744 --> 12:19.345
You're covered.

12:19.325 --> 12:20.106
I think so.

12:20.126 --> 12:24.270
The King James Bible, the only great work of art produced by a committee.

12:24.350 --> 12:28.654
I mean, if you think about it, the King James version of the Bible, which is absolutely beautiful.

12:28.975 --> 12:40.566
So gorgeous in its literature and so mind-boggling in the imaginative qualities it can bring to the fore.

12:40.666 --> 12:44.030
I thank you for that question, Rebecca.

12:44.450 --> 12:47.073
So what comes next, Nicholas?

12:47.113 --> 12:49.315
You've got this trilogy.

12:49.295 --> 12:52.019
Well, the trilogy now threatens to be a quartet.

12:52.159 --> 12:57.287
I had that feeling because you still have so much more to say.

12:57.368 --> 13:07.203
Well, ultimately, if you deal with preservation and you deal with collecting and you deal with libraries and you deal with destruction, we're dealing with book culture, but ultimately you have to deal with the reader.

13:07.804 --> 13:09.246
And what are books for?

13:09.366 --> 13:10.488
Ultimately, it's for people.

13:10.548 --> 13:13.092
And so I do have a book under contract with Harper's.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.644
And the title tentatively is Every Book Its Reader.

13:17.425 --> 13:20.229
And it will just explore any number of reading issues.

13:20.269 --> 13:21.871
And I know there have been plenty of reading books.

13:21.971 --> 13:24.014
And people give me this vacant look.

13:24.034 --> 13:26.537
They say, oh, no, don't give us another reading book.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.939
Well, trust me, I tell stories.

13:27.999 --> 13:29.981
Everything I do is through narrative.

13:30.482 --> 13:32.805
And I've got some fabulous stories that I'm working on.

13:32.865 --> 13:39.053
Isn't that wonderful that they're all still sort of bubbling up within you?

13:39.794 --> 13:40.395
I'll...

13:40.375 --> 13:42.378
And I've got two or three more beyond that.

13:42.718 --> 13:43.900
Oh, that's wonderful.

13:43.940 --> 13:44.381
Let's do this.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.404
We'll concentrate on every book that's reader right now.

13:46.424 --> 13:51.331
Well, I'm so glad you've been here this morning to share with us your thoughts.

13:51.811 --> 13:59.422
The book is called A Splendor of Letters, and the author is Nicholas Basbaines.

14:00.103 --> 14:06.512
The subtitle of the book, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.475
What a pleasure to talk with you.

14:08.455 --> 14:09.396
you so much, Diane.

14:09.537 --> 14:10.438
My pleasure.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.239
Thank you.

14:11.259 --> 14:12.621
And thanks for listening.

14:12.942 --> 14:13.983
I'm Diane Rehm.

14:16.167 --> 14:21.855
The Diane Rehm Show is produced by Sandra Pinkert, Elizabeth Terry, Ann Adams, Nancy Robertson, and Jonathan Smith.

14:22.256 --> 14:23.778
